mr.
frey,
did
they
close
these
checkpoints
who
know
the
weathers
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
interfered
with
traffic
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
just
wait
till
sunday?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
want
to
do
more
than
that,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
terry
in
those
cases
would
indicate
that
if
a
person
says
none
of
your
business,
go
on
--
it's
just
any
citizen,
then
it’s
without
reasonable
suspicion,
they
couldn’t
hold
the
person.
you're
suggesting
you
can
only
stop
but
you
can
hold
them
until
you
ask
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
reasonable
suspicion,
the
officer
supposedly
could
hold
them
until
he
finished
his
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
just
with
any
other
citizen
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
that
because
it
wasn't
a
reasonable
distance
to
the
border,
you
do
have
a
greater
power
to
stop
and
then
interrogate
and
just
with
any
citizen
on
the
street?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
within
the
border
area
that
you
think
this
special
rule
applies,
are
you
urging
that
you
must
have
the
power
randomly
to
stop?
or
do
you
say
we
--
it's
only
one
in
immigration
officer
or
border
patrol
officer
believes
there’s
something
suspicious?
justice
byron
r.
white
randomly,
as
a
deterrent?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
if
you
stop
the
moving
vehicle.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
there's
another
analogy
be
you
say
in
the
san
diego
to
police
were
making
a
license
check
for
automobile
licenses,
or
for
driver’s
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
say
though
that
in
some
other
city,
memphis,
tennessee
--
that
you
could
just
stop
anybody
and
forcibly
detain
him
while
he
is
required
about
his
citizenship.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
who
are
in
the
southern
california.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
detain
them
until
you
ascertain
with
their
citizens
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
only
for
a
brief
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you're
last
in
line
of
a
hundred
cars
and
you're
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
one
sunday
night,
that's
quite
a
while
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
basis
was
the
man
arrested?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
what
point
was
he
arrested
at?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
weren't
arrested
until
after
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
on
the
fact
that
they
couldn't
speak
english.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
within
an
area
near
the
border
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
say
that
go
about
your
business,
i
don't
want
to
answer
a
single
question,
you're
not
suppose
to
hold
them?
here,
you
say
you
can
hold
them
to
ask
them
questions,
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it's
fruitful,
and
it
is
so
fruitful
that
the
ninth
circuit
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
court
that
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
your
argument
that
at
the
border,
there
must
be
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
authority
to
not
the
people
or
not
people
to
border
and
interrogate?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
the
constitution.
how
about
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
1357?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i've
read
it,
but
--
and
on
their
face
that
on
the
face,
the
language
of
1257
--
1357
(3),
it
just
said
you
may
assert.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
certainly
includes
at
the
border.
justice
byron
r.
white
include
them
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
--
at
the
border,
all
you
need
is
1225,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
best
of
either
warrant
are
probable?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
1225
doesn't
say
at
the
border
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
officer
could
stop
this
car
and
ask
the
man
for
his
driver's
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
was
a
state
patrol
officer?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
they
just
don't
ask
you
again,
but
how
about
a
state
patrol,
highway
patrol
officer,
what
if
he
know
suspicion
at
all,
he
was
just
making
a
license
check,
the
driver’s
license
check,
but
didn't
stop
him
and
ask
him
for
his
driver's
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you
didn't
have,
one
he
get
arrested.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
let's
just
talk
about
the
analogy.
how
about
its
validity
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
and
he
stops
him
and
ask
him
for
his
driver's
license,
he
doesn't
have
it
and
he
arrest
him
for
driving
without
a
license,
and
he
objects
to
the
--
the
man
claims
that
his
fourth
amendment
rights
were
violated,
is
he
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
that,
but
i
asked
you
about
if
i
pose
the
facts
and
ask
you
the
validity
under
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
your
answer
would
be
that
if
california
law
authorizes
the
arrest
on
those
facts
that
it
would
be
all
right
under
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
congress
made
the
effort
to
the
statute,
but
if
you're
chewing
on
that
right
now.
you
just
want
to
go
back
and
make
another
proof
of
statute.
