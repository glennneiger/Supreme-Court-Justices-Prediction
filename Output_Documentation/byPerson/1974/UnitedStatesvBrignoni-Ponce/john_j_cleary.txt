mr.
john
j.
cleary
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don't
mind
having
my
brief
called
superficial
if
the
unbanked
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
is
called
superficial.
this
case
raises
a
constitutional
question
of
the
highest
magnitude,
and
would
be
the
contention
of
the
respondent
that
terry
versus
ohio
in
the
analysis
in
adams
versus
williams
did
not
affectively
answer
any
of
the
questions
here
because
in
terry
versus
ohio,
there
was
an
interference
with
the
liberty
of
a
person
on
the
street
which
was
held
to
constitute
a
seizure,
such
as
to
bring
in
to
play
the
fourth
amendment,
and
for
such
at
seizure
to
take
place,
there
must
be
objective,
articulable
facts
to
justify
that
seizure.
this
court
never
reached
the
issue
of
interrogation
at
that
point,
but
held
that
under
the
concept
of
the
protective
safety
of
the
officer,
the
officer
could
pack
down
a
minimum
intrusion.
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
white
in
his
concurring
opinion
pointed
out
that
the
man
could
not
be
in
anyway
compelled
to
answer
any
questions
under
those
circumstances
that
it
had
not
been
reached,
even
if
there
was
that
reasonable
suspicion.
further
this
court
in
adams
versus
williams
decided
that
there
must
be
two
requirements
for
such
a
momentary
stop
and
relied
upon
ninth
circuit
precedent,
wilson
versus
porter.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
speaking
for
the
court
said
one;
i
focus
suspicion
and
two,
facts.
the
intrusions
and
both
of
those
cases
involved
one,
a
person
on
the
street,
the
other,
a
parked
car.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
car
moving
down
the
highway,
an
interstate
highway
flagged
over
by
law
enforcement
officers
at
wilmer
caprice
for
whatever
reason.
there
is
a
killer
who
is
executed
in
california,
mr.
chessman
for
using
the
red
light
technique
of
flagging
cars
over.
i
would
contend
that
that
intrusion
is
of
a
most
important
magnitude.
i
would
start
off
by
saying
that
the
government
in
this
case
is
not
giving
you
the
full
flavor
of
the
statutory
analysis
involved
that
we
are
seeing
a
gut
--
a
visual
reaction
of
the
government
saying
“we
need
these
things,
therefore
we’re
going
to
have
it.”
there
is
a
serious
obstacle
involved
and
it's
not
the
checkpoints
to
alien
traffic.
it's
that
our
government
was
founded
on
the
principle,
over
200
years
to
go.
the
famous
james
otis
case
in
1761
with
the
writs
of
assistance,
on
that,
we
don't
substantiate
the
hunches,
the
esp,
the
sixth
sense
of
law
enforcement
officers.
in
that
case,
the
famous
writ
of
assistance
case,
they
ask
merely
customs
officers
to
get
untaxed
goods
in
the
port
of
entry.
and
although
with
the
english
judges,
they
did
get
that
right,
which
of
course
lead
to
the
fourth
amendment.
i'm
saying
that
in
this
particular
case,
we
are
deeming
with
the
point,
some
66
road
miles
from
the
border,
lot
further
and
then
boston
was
from
the
external
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states.
the
statutory
history
start
in
1862
with
the
collie
trade
act,
and
to
that
first
statute,
we
have
dealing
with
the
regulation,
a
person
from
outside
countries
are
racial
tone
involved
most
assuredly
was
that
we
required
reasonable
cause.
the
statutory
history
mounts
forward,
step-by-step;
there
is
reasonable
cause,
probable
cause.
in
1891,
the
predecessor
as
just
justice
white
analogized
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
we
have
1225
(a)
which
is
now
section
235
(a)
of
the
immigration
act
of
1952.
that
was
the
right
at
the
border
to
exercise
any
powers
of
inspection,
and
that
right
was
developed
onto
1917.
and
in
1917,
it
was
expanded
to
the
first
time
to
allow
bordering
and
searching
of
vehicles
which
they,
the
officers
believe
are
bringing
aliens
into
the
united
states.
in
1925,
just
like
carroll,
they've
done
for
the
law
enforcement
officer
excused
the
warrant.
so,
we
now
have
a
new
section
that
pops
up,
ironically
created
an
appropriation
bill
that
gives
an
exception
to
the
warrant
under
certain
circumstances.
that
statute
in
1925,
the
source
of
287
today
tracks
identical
language
from
the
original
one
that
says
that
they,
when
they
believe
that
the
vehicle
is
bringing
aliens
into
the
united
states.
in
1946,
the
attorney
general
and
his
one
line
letter
said
“we'd
like
to
have
the
power
to
stop
and
search.”
congress
merely
gave
them
the
right
to
continue
boarding
operation
did
not
deal
with
the
fundamental
question
now
before
this
court
the
right
to
interdict
traffic
on
a
highway
moving
throughout
the
united
states.
we're
dealing
with
a
fundamental
right.
in
1952,
the
limited
legislative
analysis
which
now
creates
both
sections,
1357
(a)
(1)
and
1357
(a)
(3)
was
early,
but
1357
(a)
(1).
we
have
there
congress
saying
at
the
border,
we
don't
want
indiscriminate
questioning
or
harassment
of
citizens
returning
to
the
united
states
and
would
expect
that
even
at
the
border,
probable
cause
would
be
necessary
to
question
citizens
that
they
are
committing
a
crime
or
about
to
commit
a
crime.
that's
the
legislative
history
behind
the
act.
justice
--
judge
browning
in
his
dissent
in
almeida-sanchez
referred
to
the
fact
that
even
the
legislative
history
clearly
announced
that
constitutional
requirements
will
be
consisted
and
interposed
upon
this
statute
and
that
the
act
have
to
be
read
in
such
a
fashion.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no
your
honor,
it
is
not.
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
authority
in
my
mind
your
honor
would
be
boyd
versus
the
united
states,
1886,
carroll
versus
the
united
states
which
indicated
traditionally.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
statutory
authority
would
exist
under
1225
(a).
mr.
john
j.
cleary
1357
is
the
exception
to
the
warrant
that
makes
no
reference
to
at
the
border.
if
you
read
each
one
of
those
four
subsections
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
read
1357
(a)
(1)
says
that
a
reasonable
distance.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
you
may
conduct
a
search.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
because
i
think
what
there's
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
would
not
--
i
would
think
that
it's
covered
already
in
1225
(a),
and
if
one
trace
is
back,
the
legislative
history
back
to
1891,
you
will
see
that
the
right
to
stop
at
the
border
was
early
recognized
in
our
country,
in
fact
with
the
original
act
in
1875.
and
so
that
my
contention
is
that
although
1357
(a)
(1)
does
give
at
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
border,
it
must
be
taken
in
context
with
the
empowering
section
which
is
1225
(a),
and
this
is
the
accepting
for
the
warrant
section.
in
that
case,
the
switch
was
made
in
1946
where
the
language
was
change
not
in
1225
(a),
but
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that
is
correct.
they
have
medical
inspections
in
the
same
original
legislation
that
talked
about
the
right
to
examine
the
person
at
the
border,
and
that
was
the
genesis.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
yes
it
does.
it
says
the
right
to
enter
the
united
states.
reenter
it
says
all
inclusive
and
upon
goes
at
the
earlier
legislative
sources
of
this
legislation
and
will
see
them
was
oriented
at
the
border,
and
then
was
expanded
as
it
has
been
expanded
to
today.
and
the
contention
i
would
make
is
in
looking
at
1357
(a)
(1)
on
(a)
(3),
once
you
look
at
1357
(a)
(2)
and
(a)
(4)
under
the
concept
of
sui
generis.
and
there,
the
right
to
arrest
an
alien
for
a
violation
of
alien
law
must
require
the
likelihood
of
escape.
otherwise,
they
have
to
resort
to
a
warrant.
in
a
fundamental
power
to
make
a
felony
arrest
which
is
authorize
in
immigration
officer
in
subsection
4,
there
is
a
statement
that
there
must
be
the
likelihood
of
escape.
and
even
further,
it
must
be
in
the
sense,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
require
that
the
likelihood
of
escape
and
the
first
section,
section
2
requires
in
his
presence
or
view.
i
would
point
out
further
that
one
of
the
most
troubling
concepts
we
have
here
is
that
this
was
an
application
of
1357
(a)
(1).
i
heard
that
deputy
solicitor
general
tell
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
1357
(a)
(1),
i
was
there
at
oral
argument
embank.
at
that
time,
the
government
counsel
relied
upon
the
escape
clause,
he
could
see
he
was
going
down
on
1357
(a)
(3)
with
the
other
cases
and
sought
to
justify
a
distinction
and
generated
1357
(a)
(1).
and
ironically,
you
might
ask
that
a
court
which
is
otherwise
split
comes
down
to
track
unanimous
on
1357
(a)
(1).
and
the
reason
why
is,
is
that
by
the
all
courts,
even
this
court
has
different
viewpoints,
there
is
sometimes
accommodation.
and
that
the
big
point
to
made
in
1357
(a)
(1)
is
that
with
carroll,
and
the
interpretation
in
almeida-sanchez,
even
a
stop,
if
one
was
to
scrutinized
supreme
court
precedent
requires
probable
cause.
and
at
least
we
can
do
is
under
these
circumstances,
no
matter
where
it
might
be,
require
a
reasonable
suspicion
which
was
in
some
way,
articulated
by
this
court
in
terry
versus
ohio.
and
it's
the
same
analysis
that
was
used
by
the
dc
circuit
in
the
aline
wong
case
which
is
the
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit's
a
dash
of
that
rule
in
not
adopting
the
tenth
circuit’s
analysis
which
of
course
was
asserted
by
this
solicitor
general
in
saying
why
there
was
a
confusion
on
the
interpretation
of
1357
(a)
(1).
i
would
contend
that
was
before
the
court
right
now
as
1357
(a)
(1).
mr.
john
j.
cleary
that
is
in
fact
your
honor,
it
requires
a
founded
suspicion
to
believe
that
there's
illegal
aliens
and
what
the
court
felt
was
that
under
wilson
versus
porter,
it
required
for
any
interdiction
of
highway
traffic,
there
must
be
founded
suspicion.
they
felt
that
they
were
bound
in
by
that
precedent
and
could
not
use
this
euphemism
of
alien
searches
to
justify
this
type
of
conduct,
absent
a
functional
equivalent.
i
would
point
out
further
that
the
interesting
thing
in
this
case
is
that
we
have
the
statute,
and
it's
a
good
reason
why
the
government
backs
away
from
1357
(a)
(1)
is
one,
they
can't
show
actual
knowledge
of
an
alien,
and
the
second
step
is
a
person
believe
to
be
an
alien.
can
they
say
that
a
person
who
appears
to
be
of
mexican
decent
in
the
area
of
southern
california
contiguous
with
the
republic
of
mexico
constitute
some
rational
basis,
reasonable
suspicion
that
that
person
is
an
alien.
i
would
contend
if
such
ever
was
the
case
that
would
be
rank
racism.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well,
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
belief
that
a
person
is
an
alien,
and
then
the
question
is
can
it
be
purely
subjective,
that
is
to
say
can
the
officer
use
anything
whatsoever,
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
under
eh
fourth
amendment
analysis,
there
has
to
be
some
basis
to
a
reviewing
court
that
that
was
in
a
sense
based
upon
something
and
not
purely
arbitrary
that
there
has
to
be
something
more
than
a
hunch.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
statute
does
not
say
that,
but
the
point
is
that
one
who
believed
to
be
an
alien
would
have
to
be
construed.
i
think
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
think
that
is
the
position
here
that
we
would
take
that
under
terry
versus
ohio,
that
there
must
be
at
least
two
criteria.
one,
suspicious
circumstance,
and
two,
objective
articulable
facts,
and
we
contend
that
the
ninth
circuit’s
construction
is
consistent
with
the
statute,
that
implements
the
statute
and
at
the
same
time
gives
validity
to
the
fourth
amendment.
the
more
important
thing
is
that
the
hunch
of
the
officer
can
be
used
and
abused.
in
this
case,
we
make
note
of
that
because
here,
the
only
articulable
basis
given
in
cross-examination
was
that
the
person
appeared
to
be
of
mexican
decent.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
problem
in
the
area
of
the
mexican
border,
and
that
is
the
analysis.
well,
let
us
take
a
look.
what
do
we
mean
by
area
of
the
mexican
border?
well,
we
know
is
at
least
2,000
miles
long
in
one
respect,
but
how
far
does
it
go
inland?
well,
where's
the
limitation
in
1357
(a)
(1)?
there
is
none.
there
is
a
limitation
in
1357
(a)
(3),
reasonable
distance.
now,
the
government
contends
well,
you
have
to
interpolate
(3)
onto
(1)
and
you
come
up
with
rationale
for
the
action.
i
would
say
there's
two
cases
they
cited,
and
i
believe
the
court
does
have
the
reply
brief
at
this
time.
the
first
one
they
cite
is
montes
hernandez,
a
district
court
case
appears
at
page
14
and
28
of
the
principle
government
brief
in
the
footnote,
and
there,
because
of
the
heavy
alien
population
in
sacramento,
california
or
bright,
california,
500
miles
from
the
border,
the
court
upheld
the
right
to
stop
and
interrogate
an
alien.
so,
that's
one
demonstration
of
how
1357
(a)
(1)
is
used.
the
second
example
cited
to
us
by
the
government
is
in
their
reply
brief
on
the
last
page,
the
last
footnote
to
saldana
case.
there,
alien
was
stopped
on
the
1357
(a)
(1).
what
was
the
distance
from
the
border?
it
was
the
will
rogers
turnpike
in
oklahoma,
six
to
700
miles
from
the
border.
now,
the
government
could
say
we’re
going
to
be
good
guys.
we'll
only
go
up
to
a
100
miles.
i
don't
think
that
this
type
of
power
is
dealing
with
a
serious
constitutional
questions
can
be
so
delegated
to
the
executive.
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
intervention,
either
judicial
review
or
on
the
alternative
warrant.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
certainly
agree
your
honor.
i
think
that
one
has
to
consider
the
geographical
territory.
i
think
that
was
the
rational
behind
what
is
called
functional
equivalent
in
the
border.
but
again
as
an
advocate
for
particular
case,
i'm
talking
about
a
roving
patrol
operating
some
66
miles
north
of
san
diego,
the
second
largest
city
on
the
west
coast,
half
way
between
los
angeles
which
is
the
largest
city
on
the
west
coast.
and
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances,
such
a
roving
patrol
can't
be
condone
and
that
this
rationale
or
distinction
by
saying
that
distance
--
true
if
we
were
talking
about
the
stacatti
checkpoint
which
i've
never
known
to
exist.
number
4,
in
government’s
map
in
the
otis
case,
if
there
was
a
rover
patrol
up
in
that
area,
maybe
the
right
to
stop
would
exist
because
the
area
plus
other
factors
might
give
a
reasonable
or
found
it
suspicion
or
even
probable
cause
to
stop.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
certainly,
not
a
border
patrol
officer
your
honor.
and
if
it
was
a
--
and
this
is
an
important.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
then,
we
have
to
understand
that
in
the
federal
system,
we
have
as
i'm
told
by
this
court
so
often,
a
very
limited
jurisdiction.
and
if
you
take
the
average
officer
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
in
that
case
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
in
that
case
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
that
there
would
be
inappropriate
for
several
reasons
in
that
analogy.
first
is
the
point
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
his
right
to
stop
at
random
a
person
for
a
driver's
license
check,
in
my
contention
would
not
be
appropriate
if
it
went
beyond
the
scope
of
that.
number
two,
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
i
think
he
has
a
right
in
california
and
the
reason
i
would
say
is
that
a
person
arrested
for
none
possession
of
a
driver’s
license
is
not
necessarily
take
into
the
custody.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
and
i'm
trying
to
respond
your
honor.
the
fourth
amendment,
if
he
didn't
have
a
valid
basis
for
arresting
him,
he
could
make
a
lawful
arrest.
he
has
the
physical
power,
but
you
asked
it
in
terms
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
the
authority
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
my
contention
is
where
a
man
can
turn
in,
submit
by
mail
to
effect
that
he
does
have
a
driver’s
license
indicates
that
the
right
of
the
state
in
preserving
its
highways
has
only
one
means
to
check
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
the
fourth
and
fourteenth?
i
would
say
no
your
honor.
under
the
commonwealth
versus
swanger
pennsylvania
recent
analysis
would
said
even
a
roadblock
check
for
driver's
license
must
have
at
least
found
it
suspicion,
because
otherwise,
the
intrusion
on
privacy
is
not
justified
by
the
community
need.
i
would
point
out
again
that
the
traffic
situation
is
totally
different
because
we
have
a
state
officer
and
again
as
the
only
means
to
protect
the
highways
from
incompetent
drivers.
i
think
that
also,
there’s
a
serious
question
in
this
area.
i'm
not
in
the
position
if
this
court
is.
but
i
think
the
case
before
the
court
deals
with
a
right
of
a
federal
officer
in
restricting
aliens.
i
would
further
point
out
that
the
argument
of
the
government
is
this
would
not
apply
in
new
york
city
or
in
some
of
the
larger
cities,
but
would
apply
in
san
diego
and
in
tucson
for
example.
and
i
think
even
further
if
we
don't
know
if
a
100-mile
limit
applies.
i
think
the
arbitrariness
of
that
is
that
a
man's
constitutional
rights
will
vary
by
were
he
happens
to
live.
i
think
that
people
should
not
be
so
discriminative
against.
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
brief,
we
have
indicated
the
reference
in
new
york
city
sometimes
that
certain
sweeps
are
made
was
raised
by
the
court
earlier
in
questioning,
but
i
think
the
issue
is
you
cannot
pick
out
certain
areas
because
then
you’re
going
to
get
into
the
winos
of
the
problem.
i
think
the
second
is
that
you
can
justify
an
excuse.
some
type
of
camera
analysis,
there
has
been
no
showing
of
the
warrant
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that
that
forecloses
the
use
of
camera
in
this
particular
situation.
this
particular
case
is
rather
unique
in
the
sense
of
--
i
know,
there’s
a
previous
case
pending
before
the
court,
juana
sanchez.
in
this
case,
i
would
point
out
that
one,
the
objects
of
the
indictment,
count
1
and
count
2,
the
named
individuals
are
the
person
that
was
seize
from
the
automobile.
and
that
same
ways
that
he
had
an
unregistered
machine
gun
in
back
or
control
substance,
he
would
have
stand
into
object
to
that.
further,
these
people
gave
testimony
against
him
and
uses
own
statements.
third,
you
got
to
understand
to
deny
that
testimony,
and
fourth,
he
was
cross-examined
by
the
prosecutor
by
money
found
in
his
pocket.
so,
there
was
a
seizure
of
money
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
flowing
from
this
as
we
would
contend
unlawful
stop.
i
would
further
point
out
is
to
retroactivity
in
this
case
that
we
are
in
a
unique
posture
and
not
to
be
overly
technical.
we
would
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that
the
government
did
not
assert
non-retroactivity
in
this
case
and
we
would
rely
upon
that
factor
which
appears
at
their
brief
pages
7
and
8
and
on
page
9
of
the
brief
and
the
petition
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
fix
checkpoint
could
be
subject
under
the
fourth
amendment
concepts
to
a
warrant.
i
think
that
a
warrant
can
be
tailored
for
a
checkpoint
based
upon
an
analysis
to
use
the
court’s
reference
to
four
points
that
were
cited
in
your
concurring
opinion.
i
think
though
that
it
has
to
be
one,
that
complies
with
some
procedure
either
annunciated
by
this
court
in
the
opinion
or
that
there
would
have
to
be
some
change
in
say
rule
41
or
federals
and
criminal
procedure.
there
is
we
called
it
a
warrant
for
inspection
in
our
area
and
there
some
equivocation
as
to
how
it
works
out.
the
difficulty
comes
and
trying
to
make
a
showing
and
often,
i
feel
that
there
is
not
a
full
adversary
showing
and
we
even
tried
to
for
example
to
get
statistics
on
the
aliens
coming
from
the
border
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint.
one,
the
border
patrol
denied
this
an
opportunity
to
get
such
statistics.
two,
we
got
an
action
for
mandate
pended
on
the
ninth
circuit.
so
that
the
question
in
this
area
is
that
we
don't
have
access
to
some
of
this
information
and
i
feel
that
there
should
be
some
substantial
showing
made
to
a
court,
i
don't
know
what
to
be
called
that
could
allow
other
parties
to
contest
some
of
the
facts
to
justify
the
need.
i
think
it
is
conceptually
feasible
as
i've
indicated
in
our
brief
that
such
a
warrant
could
be
established.
i
think
that
as
mr.
savilla
has
point
out
that
one
of
the
key
factors
is
proximity
to
the
border
in
the
sense
that
the
fifth
circuit
analysis
might
be
certainly,
reasonable
in
the
hart
case
on
zero
blanca,
but
would
be
grossly
unreasonable
in
this
case.
for
example
the
reason
mr.
savilla
and
i
differ
which
judge
turrentine,
he
held
every
checkpoint
in
the
southern
district
of
california
to
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
border,
even
san
clemente
and
although
one
might
have
conclusion
to
be
reached,
we
might
differ
with
the
reasoning
and
the
approach
to
that
topic,
and
yet
not
foreclose
the
area
that
such
warrants
might
be
possible
or
that
it
could
be
considered
a
functional
equivalent.
the
second
point
on
retroactive
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
well
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
there
would
be
in
a
sense,
an
after
effect
that
a
motion
to
suppress,
but
that
in
the
ease
of
criminal
justice
that
if
such
notice
could
be
given,
i
don't
know
how
would
we
--
their
renewed
and
using
every
10
days
because
rule
41
i
think
provides
only
now
for
10-limit
out
of
warrant
so
that
there
has
to
be
a
return
on
them.
and
that
sometimes,
and
i'm
trying
to
reduce
litigation.
we
can
go
on
a
file
motion
to
suppress
until
the
cows
come
home.
but
if
sometimes
the
court
when
is
dealing
with
such
a
touchy
area
could
give
notice
to
the
other
parties,
and
the
point
i'm
trying
to
suggest
right
now
is
although
a
warrant
is
certainly
possible,
the
real
answer
lies
in
congress
in
dealing
with
the
alien
problem.
and
that
just
like
in
biswell
and
colonnade,
the
congress
set
forth
the
search
warrant
requirement
in
the
other
procedures
and
i
think
that
their
in
an
areas
where
that
procedure
could
be
adopted.
i
don't
those
two
cases
applied
to
this.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
no
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
i
think
if
congress
was
faced
with
the
thing,
they
do
provide
for
all
viewpoints
to
be
expressed,
and
i
think
that
there
would
be
a
much
more
workable
conclusion
establish,
and
i
think
that
some
of
these
things
where
done
at
that
time
when
the
problems
that
are
now
before
the
court
weren't
fully
presented
to
the
congress
and
i
think
that
consistent
with
our
tri
parte
form
of
government,
we
should
use
different
avenues
for
different
results.
here,
i'm
pleading
the
fourth
amendment
situation
and
the
rights
of
the
individual
given
the
statutory
language
with
more
properly
how
they
are
applied
by
federal
agents.
i
would
point
out
further
to
the
court
that
one
of
the
most
serious
concerns
in
this
case
was
that
this
defendant,
now
respondent,
was
stop
because
the
three
occupants
appeared
of
mexican
decent.
number
one;
the
driver
is
a
spanish
speaking
puerto
rican
american
citizen.
number
two;
one
is
a
mexican
from
guadalajara.
the
number
thee;
the
third
one
is
a
woman
from
guatemala.
now,
the
concern
was
mexican
appearing
alone.
and
counsel
being
sensitive
to
this
area
laid
in
the
record
in
this
as
to
the
reason
for
the
stop.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
properly
contended
that
there
could
be
arbitrary
in
the
shown
on
his
power.
if
this
court
where
to
give
him
cart
blanch
power
on
the
1357
(a)
(1)
that
even
cart
blanch
power
exercise
and
say
the
area,
the
mexican
border
could
be
done
arbitrarily
if
done
purely
on
the
basis
of
raise,
a
yick
wo
concept.
now
first,
i
would
start
off
in
their
government
reply
brief,
they
respond
to
this
issue
and
this
issue
alone.
they
contend
that
i
don't
have
standing
because
i
haven't
file
a
cross
petition.
i
would
point
out
two
things
that
cuts
both
ways,
they
use
that
argument
on
page
11
in
the
bowen
brief
and
number
two,
the
analysis
i’m
making
here
is
my
conclusion
on
the
last
page
of
my
brief
says
very
simply,.
i
want
you
to
uphold
the
ninth
circuit.
im
not
asking
you
to
order
the
charges
dismissed.
i'm
here
defending
that
opinion.
i'm
asking
for
no
more
that
upholding
the
unanimous
action
of
the
ninth
circuit.
i
do
believe
that
under
ballad
versus
the
united
states,
i
can
assert
any
reason
to
defend
that
particular
opinion.
now,
the
interesting
aspect
was
before
i
raise
the
racial
discriminatory
issue,
the
government
in
five
places
in
its
brief
raises
mexican
appearing
as
the
basis
of
giving
them
something
maybe
less
than
reasonable
suspicion,
but
the
justification
for
the
stop.
it's
our
contention
that
you
can't
use
race
alone,
possibly
is
one
of
many
factors
it
can
be
used.
it
might
be
used
in
many
other
things.
spanish
speaking,
we
have
a
problem
because
i
think
we
have
a
substantial
portion
of
the
citizen
population
that
speaks
spanish
and
spanish
only.
the
analogy
i'd
like
to
refer
to
was
an
opinion
cited
by
the
government
in
the
footnote
following
up
the
aline
wong
case,
the
cheung
tin
wong
case
which
judge
mckinnon
of
the
dc
circuit
said
you
will
never
have
suspicion
alone
based
upon
oriental
appearance
for
a
stop.
however,
suspicion
plus
that
fact
that
the
man
couldn't
speak
english
and
was
in
white
clothes
gave
justification
for
a
momentary
stop.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
my
suggestion
your
honor
would
be
a
multiplicity.
if
i
can
use
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
okay.
the
first
things
i
would
use
would
be
one,
the
proximity
to
the
border.
i
would
based
it
upon
factors
that
might
lead
me
to
believe
that
the
person
was
an
alien
such
as
if
he
didn’t
speak
the
language,
it
might
alert
me
was
certainly
not
justify
me
in
stopping
the
man.
i
think
the
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
before
you
stop
them,
i
think
the
problem
would
be
is
that
you'd
have
to
have
some
other
basis.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
my
factors
would
be
that
the
critical
aspect
is
the
source
of
his
entry.
i.e.,
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
your
honor,
the
only
thing
i
can
suggest
is
that
factors
would
determine
in
a
multiplicity
circumstances.
if
i
followed
along
the
border
and
i
saw
footprints
running
in
a
mile,
it
would
be
to
a
certain
bush;
i
go
walk
up
and
found
the
man
as
the
bush,
i
would
say
that's
a
factor
to
believe
that
that
person
is
an
alien,
and
yet
i
haven’t
talk
to
him,
i
don’t
know
how
to
addressing
him
by
his
race
and
i
think,
i
would
have
a
right
as
a
law
enforcement
officer
to
stop
him.
but
to
give
you
something
that
i
could
go
by
physical
appearance
in
these
days,
where
the
freedom
of
the
individuals
are
so
protected,
i
can’t
give
you
any
basis
that
would
justify
on
appearance
alone
of
a
stop.
they
would
rise
to
the
level
founded
suspicion.
in
terry
versus
ohio,
was
the
man
walking
back
and
forth
outside
the
jewelry,
sufficient
to
justify
the
stop
and
the
answer
was,
the
court
held
it
took
20
minutes
of
watching
the
conduct,
the
experience
officer,
and
at
that
time,
the
had
probably
--
even
probable
cause
to
believe
a
conspiracy
to
rub
was
take
in
place.
my
contention
is
that
you
can't
use
the
fact
of
a
--
now,
if
he
had
on
made
to
mexico
on
his
back,
on
a
shirt
or
tijuana,
then
maybe
that
might
be
an
appearance
factor
that
will
help
out.
but
i'm
hard
press
to
give
you
any
facts
that
would
suit
this
case
where
an
officer
at
wilmer
caprice
some
66
miles
from
the
border
could
stop
a
car
on
the
basis
of
appearance.
i
can't
say
old
cars
or
new
cars.
in
fact,
what
shocks
me
is
the
government
in
the
reply
brief
in
otis
say
that
you
can
tell
a
mexican
resident
because
they’re
thin.
how
many
fat
aliens
have
i
represented?
you
contest
because
they
have
coarse
hands,
that
they
ware
coarse
clothes;
they
have
their
haircut
in
a
certain
way.
i've
had
my
haircut
once
or
twice
in
tijuana.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
there
are
facts
but
the
facts
are
difficult
and
the
reason
is
there's
a
balancing
of
interest.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
there's
no
basis
--
mr.
john
j.
cleary
if
i
was
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
and
i
sought
car
drive
by
with
the
baja
california
license
plate,
i
think
i
might
a
have
a
fact
to
stop
a
car.
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
cleary
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
