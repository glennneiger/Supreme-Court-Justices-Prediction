mr.
frey,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
some
prior
casement
to
try,
don't
recall
which
one,
not
almeida-sanchez,
i
think
before
that.
there
was
reference
to
in
occasion
when
this
strict
border
search
that
mr.
justice
white
alluded
to
was
enforced
for
some
period
of
time,
resulted
in
diplomatic
representations
by
the
mexican
government
to
the
state
department
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
in
the
case
--
you're
not
familiar
with
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
suppression
of
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
excuse
me.
before
you
go
on
with
that,
sit
back
and
track
your
argument
on
applying
the
terry
stop
principles
to
the
situation.
you
say
that
--
but
then
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
border,
the
officers
may
stop
any
car
for
any
reason
just
to
ask
him
questions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
a
particular
reason.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
probably
cause.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
then,
when
it
develops
at
that
point
that
the
occupants
of
the
car
or
some
of
them
cannot
speak
english,
are
you
suggesting
that
a
probably
cause
then
comes
in
to
be
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
taking
that
step-by-step,
you
would
claim
the
same
right
in
des
moines,
iowa
necessarily.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
saying
that
probable
cause
arises
from
the
inability
of
these
people
to
speak
english
because
they
are
in
close
proximity
to
the
mexican
border?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
cannot
be.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
frey.
mr.
cleary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
that
reasonable
standard
must
taken
to
account
the
nature
of
the
country
in
which
the
reasonable
distance
is
to
be
measured?
whether
it's
open
wild
country
or
whether
it's
san
antonio,
texas
for
example
or
either
city?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
really
saying
is
you
can't
get
there
from
here,
aren't
you?
you
can't
stop
them.
there's
no
basis
for
stopping
and
inquiring.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
and
you
have
a
very,
very
broad
experience
as
we
know
mr.
cleary.
if
you
can't
think
of
any
reason,
how
about
these
border
patrol
officers
who
haven't
nearly
youâ€™re
read
of
experience
or
education?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
cleary.
how
about
three
minutes
left
i
think
mr.
frey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
frey.
mr.
cleary,
you
appeared
of
our
request
by
our
appointment
and
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
thank
you
for
your
assistance.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
