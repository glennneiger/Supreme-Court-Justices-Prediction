mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
reversing
respondent’s
conviction
for
transporting
aliens
who
were
present
in
this
country
illegally.
the
reversal
was
predicated
on
the
ground
that
the
stopovers
respondent's
car
and
the
ensuing
inquiry
as
to
the
nationality
of
its
occupants
violated
the
fourth
amendment,
and
the
testimony
of
trial
with
the
aliens
who
were
being
transported
by
respondent
was
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree,
and
that
their
testimony
should
have
been
suppressed.
respondent
was
arrested
on
the
evening
of
march
11,
1973
by
two
border
patrol
officers
who
were
on
duty
on
a
patrol
car,
stationed
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint.
the
checkpoint
was
closed
at
the
time
due
to
inclement
weather.
the
patrol
car
was
parked
at
right
angle
to
the
highway
with
its
headlights
directed
toward
the
highway
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
could
--
would
illuminate
the
passing
cars.
the
officers
observe
respondent's
car
passed
by
containing
respondent
and
two
passengers,
all
of
whom
to
appeared
to
be
of
mexican
decent.
they
pursued
and
stopped
the
vehicle
for
what
they
characterized
suppression
hearing
as
a
routine
immigration
inspection.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
closed
them
for
various
reasons.
there
is
a
concern
about
the
effect
of
the
checkpoint
operation
on
the
flow
of
traffic.
and
at
times
when
traffic
is
heavy
for
instance
on
sunday
afternoon,
they
normally
feel
compelled
to
close
the
checkpoint
down
because
it’s
interfering
too
much
with
the
normal
flow
of
traffic.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
board
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
board
--
well,
that
that
is
a
problem
and
in
our
reply
brief
in
ortiz,
we
have
a
footnote
which
indicates
what
happened
when
one
sunday
quite
unexpectedly,
they
kept
the
checkpoint
open,
and
they
caught
exceptionally
large
numbers
of
illegal
entrance
on
that
occasion.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
a
problem
and
the
border
patrol
believes
that
it
its
responsibility
to
attempt
to
balance
its
interest
in
apprehending
aliens
with
the
interest
of
motorist
on
the
highway
to
proceed
without
a
two-hour
traffic
jam.
we
try
to
avoid
that
kind
of
imposition
on
the
traffic.
now
of
course,
it
does
--
there
are
holes
in
the
system.
it
is
possible
for
a
skilled,
knowledgeable
smuggler
and
many
of
the
alien
smugglers
are
highly
sophisticated.
they
have
drop
houses
and
near
the
border,
they
have
scouts
who
go
ahead
and
phone
back
and
so
on.
it
is
possible
for
--
to
evade
the
system,
and
that
is
not
air
tight.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
familiar
with
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
say
though
that
even
at
the
border,
the
question
of
how
closely
they
search
people's
bags,
how
many
people,
what
proportion
of
the
entrance
arriving
at
the
port
of
entry
or
search
at
the
dallas
airport
of
something
will
depend
on
the
volume
of
people.
if
there’s
a
three
747's
that
just
come
in
with
a
large
number
of
people,
checking
is
going
to
be
somewhat
more
cursory,
more
people
will
probably
passed
through
by
customs
without
a
care
for
search
of
their
baggage.
these
are
the
accommodations
to
the
exigencies
of
the
situation.
in
any
event
in
this
case,
they
questioned
the
passengers
in
english
which
they
appeared
not
to
understand,
and
then
in
spanish
concerning
their
citizenship,
and
they
discovered
that
the
passengers
had
no
papers
authorizing
them
to
be
in
the
united
states.
respondent
and
the
passengers
where
then
arrested.
the
suppression
hearing
took
place
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez
and
there
was
a
quite
cursory
exploration
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
stop.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
was
a
motion
made
by
respondent
to
suppress
testimony
of
the
aliens
as
the
fruit
of
an
illegal
search.
at
the
time,
it
was
i
think
quite
clear
to
everybody
on
the
ninth
circuit
law
then
that
that
motion
had
no
hope
of
prevailing
at
that
time.
and
as
i
say,
the
--
i
think,
it
was
actually
held
on
the
day
of
trial
and
denied.
the
only
inquiry
into
the
particular
reason
for
selecting
respondent's
car
for
a
stop
was
made
in
the
form
of
a
couple
of
leading
question
asked
on
cross-examination
by
respondent’s
counsel.
now
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
first
considered
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
roving
patrol
or
a
checkpoint
stop
and
decided
that
it
was
more
properly
characterize
as
a
roving
patrol
and
we
haven’t
challenge
that
characterization
here.
if
the
side
of
the
roving
patrol
stops
are
invalid
and
the
absence
of
a
warrant
or
particularized
found
that
suspicion.
i
don't
even
think
it's
--
it
didn't
suggest
that
a
warrant
would
do,
but
in
this
case
of
course,
there
was
no
warrant.
it
consider
this
conclusion
to
flow
from
the
decision
of
this
court
and
in
almeida-sanchez
and
from
this
court’s
reliance
on
carroll
which
i
point
out
carroll
is
square
with
almeida-sanchez
in
the
sense
that
carroll
involve
a
roving
patrol
search.
the
other
cases
we
have
here
are
not
--
are
distinguishable
from
carroll.
one
on
the
basis
that
they
involved
checkpoints
which
we
say
are
different
and
in
this
case
that
we're
not
seeking
here
the
authority
to
search,
but
simply
to
stop
and
carroll
was
not
concerned
with
a
pure
stop,
but
rather
with
a
search
of
mr.
carroll’s
car.
we
submit
that
there
is
a
substantial
constitutionally
significant
difference
between
a
search
of
an
automobile
and
a
stop
for
the
purpose
of
briefly
interrogating
its
occupants
regarding
their
right
to
be
in
the
united
states.
and
that
with
respect
to
stops
within
the
reasonable
distance
of
the
mexican
border,
this
court
should
honor
the
congressional
judgment
that
warrant
will
stops
for
this
limited
purpose,
a
reasonable
and
proper
to
held
enforce
a
vitally
important
congressional
policy
to
limit
the
influx
of
aliens
for
residence
in
the
united
states.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances.
we
would
not
--
we
do
not
assert
a
right
to
stop
cars
on
a
random
basis
or
without
particularized
suspicion
in
chicago.
there
is
an
issue
if
we
believe
that
a
car
contain
an
alien
of
if
we
believe
that
a
pedestrian
was
an
alien.
subsection
1
of
the
statute
appears
to
confer
a
right
to
interrogate
that
person.
i
basically
rely
in
this
case
on
subsection
3
rather
than
on
subsection
1
of
section
287;
that
is
i'm
relying
on
the
--
i'm
contending
that
stop
and
question
authority
is
necessarily
encompass
within
the
authority
that
congress
conferred
to
board
and
search.
and
that
although
to
the
extent
that
purported
to
give
that
authority
to
search
on
roving
patrols
in
almeida-sanchez,
this
court
held
that
invalid.
we
think
that
the
lesser
authority
at
stake
in
stopping
and
interrogating
is
constitutionally
permissible
and
that
the
statute
should
be
upheld
in
that
regard.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
primarily
on
3,
within
the
border
area.
in
other
words,
our
position
is
that
we
have
a
superior,
a
greater
right
to
stop
and
interrogate
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
boarder
then
we
would
have
outside
the
reasonable
distance
of
the
boarder.
i
think
we've
tried
to
make
it
clear
in
our
brief
that
we
are
not
saying
that
we
could
setup
a
checkpoint
on
road
between
omaha
and
des
moine
and
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
true,
but
we
have
here
more
than
a
simple
interrogation
in
order
to
get
to
interrogate
respondent,
we
have
to
stop
his
automobile.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
he
were
a
pedestrian,
i
think
there
would
be
a
basis
for
arguing
that
you
could
go
up
to
him
and
simply
say
“i'm
an
officer
of
the
immigration
service
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
or
indeed,
are
you
a
citizen
of
the
united
states?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
when
i
get
into
the
legal
portion
of
the
argument,
we're
suggesting
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
true.
now
of
course,
respondent
says
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
they
were
no
--
i
don't
believe
that
a
police
officer
could
forcibly
detain
just
any
person.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
and
i
think
the
statute
makes
that
distinction
and
we
rely
on
3.
there
is
an
argument
about
what
subsection
1
means
because
subsection
1
talks
about
a
belief
that
the
person
is
an
alien.
subsection
3
requires
no
belief
of
that
sort.
i
think
it
would
be
debatable
as
to
whether
we
would
have
the
authority
under
subsection
1
to
forcibly
detain
somebody
within
the
border
area
within
the
100
miles
without
a
belief
that
he
was
an
alien.
there
would
be
some
problems
under
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
3
gives
us
the
power
to
stop
and
search
as
we
construe
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
to
board
and
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
vehicle.
in
this
case,
we're
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
statute
is
derived
from
authority
at
the
border
with
respect
to
stop
vehicles,
but
i
think
it’s
entirely
clear
from
an
examination
of
the
history
of
the
statute
that
this
was
intended
to
confer
the
power
to
stop
a
moving
automobile.
and
that
was
not
doubted
in
almeida-sanchez,
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
statute
already
contained
the
language
board
and
search.
in
1946,
what
congress
did
was
it
remove
from
the
statute
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
belief
that
the
person
be
an
alien,
and
it
introduce
then
to
the
statute
the
right
to
make
this
search
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
border
and
not
simply
at
the
border.
and
i
think
if
the
court
looks
at
what
congress
did
in
1946,
there
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
serious
question
that
congress
intended
to
confer
this
power
that
intended
to
confer
the
power
to
search.
we
say
this
is
necessarily
included
within
the
power
to
search
is
the
power
to
stop.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
we
say
that
we
have
the
power
to
stop
randomly.
i
would
like
to
make
a
point
in
connection
with
terry.
we
say
we
have
the
power
to
stop
and
interrogate
randomly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
as
both
of
deterrent
and
apprehension
tools.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it's
completely
irrelevant.
now,
i
could
picture
a
case
in
which
the
individual
stop
was
let
us
say
a
60-year-old
lady
who
was
alone
in
her
car
and
who
was
clearly
anglo-saxon,
and
her
car
was
stop
for
simply
for
the
purpose
of
asking
her
about
her
citizenship
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
search
authority.
now,
i'm
just
talking
about
stopping
and
asking
the
person
in
the
car
with
their
citizenship
is,
and
i
--
such
a
person
might
be
able
to
argue
that
while
it’s
true
that
ought
to
have
random
power
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
unreasonable
to
stop
me
because
she
might
be,
that’s
true.
but
of
course,
the
conditions
in
the
mexican
border
area
that
justify
the
power
that
we
are
asserting
here
and
that
we
say
make
this
case
distinguishable
from
terry's
articulated
particularize
suspicion
requirement
is
an
applicable
to
mexican.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
of
the
particular
conditions
that
is
existed
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
is
the
equivalent
of
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
in
the
case
of
mr.
terry,
it
was
obviously
necessary
for
the
court
to
require
specific
facts
relating
to
mr.
terry
because
otherwise,
you
would
have
a
rule
that
would
leave
--
the
police
have
liberty
any
place
in
the
country
to
forcibly
detain
anybody
with
no
reason
at
all.
now
here,
we're
saying
there's
a
substitute.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
we
think
this
is
quite
analogous
to
a
driver's
license
check,
although
we
think
that
the
showing
of
the
constitutional
equivalent
of
probable
cause
that
we
can
show
here
is
far
greater
than
any
that
can
be
shown
to
justify
stopping
people
for
a
license
check,
because
we
think
that
what’s
at
stake
here
is
literally
--
the
problem
of
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
we're
not
asserting
the
authority
to
stop
anybody
in
memphis,
tennessee
and
forcibly
detain
them,
unless,
there
might
be
circumstance
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
in
southern
california.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
asserting
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
for
a
brief
time,
we
consider
--
i
mean,
to
call
it
a
forcible
detention
for
most
people
who
drive
along
the
highway,
it’s
a
question
of
stopping
your
car.
the
officer
comes
over.
he
says
you
know,
what
is
your
citizenship?
if
they
are
not
been
citizen
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
border
patrol
are
sensitive
to
those
concerns,
closes
the
checkpoint
so
it
does
--
it
avoids
the
situation
in
which
you
have
a
hundred
cars
backed
up.
the
way
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
operates,
it
does
not
stop
every
car.
the
figure
of
99.9%
that
was
given
to
you
in
the
last
argument
with
respect
to
the
number
of
aliens
that
are
apprehended
is
a
terribly
misleading
figure
because
what
was
done
there
was
to
compare
the
total
flow
of
traffic
across
the
road
with
the
number
of
aliens
who
were
caught.
but
the
vast
bulk
of
the
traffic
is
not
stopped.
we
do
not
stop
every
car
in
a
highway
like
san
clemente
where
the
traffic
is
extremely
heavy,
a
very
small
proportion
or
stop.
now
of
course,
many
are
required
to
slow
down
as
they
go
by
the
checkpoint.
that
is
an
inconvenience.
we
think
that
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
our
subjecting
people
to
that
kind
of
inconvenience
to
serve
the
vital
objective
that
this
program
is
design
to
serve.
now,
i
think
it's
important
to
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
without
any
particular
reason?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
or
even
found
it
suspicion,
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
there
is
no
serious
dispute
on
that,
that
is
if
we
were
entitled
to
stop
respondent’s
car,
i
don't
think
there’s
any
serious
challenge
that
once
they
shrug
their
shoulders
and
didn't
speak
english,
we
had
an
effect
probably
cause
for
the
--
and
suing
arrest.
the
focus
of
this
case
is
on
whether
we
could
stop
this
in
the
first
place
and
get
to
ask
the
question.
and
of
course,
if
we
can't
stop
this
car,
then
we
have
no
way
of
interdicting
with
the
flow
through
in
our
view.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
we
wouldn't,
unless
there
were
special
conditions
that
i
don't
think
exist
in
des
moines,
iowa.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
no.
but
well,
let
me
make
a
distinction
mr.
chief
justice.
there
are
--
the
distinctions
that
are
constitutionally
portent
and
those
that
are
made
by
the
statute.
the
statute
makes
a
distinction
between
the
area
within
a
hundred
miles
of
the
border
and
the
rest
of
the
country.
the
interrogation
authority
that
the
statute
confers
which
is
nationwide
is
restricted
to
persons
who
were
believed
to
be
aliens.
now
from
the
constitutional
standpoint,
the
court
asks
us
what
is
our
justification
for
impeding
people
in
going
about
their
business
from
making
them
stop
their
cars
and
roll
down
their
windows
and
answer
a
question,
and
we
are
saying
that
in
this
case
and
in
this
group
of
cases,
the
constitutional
justification
is
that
there
are
special
in
the
area
of
the
mexican
border,
that
these
problems
are
enormous,
that
the
traffic
check
operations
are
vital
to
our
system
of
stopping
the
inflow
of
illegal
entrance
from
mexico
into
the
interior
labor
markets.
that
is
our
constitutional
justification
and
we're
relying
on
camara
together
with
terry.
we
rely
on
camara
for
the
portion
that
says
we
don't
need
special
focus
probable
cause
when
we
have
shown
conditions
which
we
say
in
gravity
for
our
society
far
out
way
the
kinds
of
things
that
see
and
the
camara,
we're
concerned
with
housing
codes
whether
the
basement,
apartment,
in
an
apartment
building
was
being
used
for
residence.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
was
arrested
for
the
offense
of
transporting
--
knowingly
transporting
aliens
who
are
illegally
in
the
country.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
after
it
turned
out
that
the
aliens
both
couldn't
speak
english
and
when
they
were
interrogated
in
spanish
had
no
papers
whatsoever
indicating
their
right
to
be
in
the
country.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
were
not
arrested.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
that
was
--
they
were
then
ask
whether
they
had
papers
since
their
presumably,
they
might
not
be
able
to
speak
english,
that
they
might
have
been
lawfully
admitted.
but
if
--
but
an
alien,
even
if
he's
lawfully
admitted
has
a
duty
to
carry
around
--
i
think
it's
a
151,
and
he
can
be
ask
for
that.
the
only
problem
is
whether
we
can
woke
up
to
somebody
in
the
street
not
knowing
that
he
is
an
alien,
but
thinking
that
he
might
be,
that
that’s
an
issue.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
could
stop
a
car.
another
point,
i
don't
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
i
were
representing
the
old
lady,
i
would
say
that
while
it's
true
that
the
government
may
have
a
right
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
was
responding
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
brennan's.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
trying
my
best.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
distinction
is
that
--
is
that
--
it's
not
--
i'm
saying
that
we
have
a
right
to
stop
anybody.
now
the
question
is
in
particular
circumstances,
we
might
unreasonably
exercise
that
right.
suppose
we
have
--
suppose
someone
had
going
through
the
san
clemente
check
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
that
--
i
don't
wish
to
spend
very
much
time.
i
could
picture
an
argument
being
made
which
i
don't
think
can
be
made
by
respondent.
if
we
have
just
stop
him
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint,
searched
his
car,
interrogated
him
and
say
drive
of,
and
then
we
followed
him
and
stop
him
again
two
miles
down
the
road,
somebody
could
say
that
was
unreasonable.
we
have
no
issue
of
anything
like
that
here.
that's
the
point
that
i'm
making.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
would
have
a
right
to
stop
it
in
our
view,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
question,
there
is
a
question
apart
from
the
statute
and
apart
from
the
general
area
probable
cause.
there
is
a
question
whether
in
particular
circumstances,
a
search
was
unreasonable.
for
instance,
if
we
yank
somebody
out
of
the
car
and
put
him
up
against
the
car
and
padded
him
down
for
instance,
that
would
be
an
unreasonable
search
on
our
part.
that's
all
i
need
to
say
is
that
there
could
be
an
argument
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
it,
the
right
to
stop
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
they
discussed
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
--
i'm
not
certain
what
the
government
argued
there,
but
the
court
of
appeals
was
talking
about
the
bowman
case
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
bowman
case
relied
on
(a)
(1).
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
“well,
if
you
rely
on
(a)
(1),
what
you’re
claiming
is
a
very
broad
authority
of
a
kind
that
we're
not
prepared
to
say
the
government
has.”
and
all
that
i'm
saying
here
is
that
we
are
not
relying
--
we're
not
saying
we
could
do
the
same
thing
anyplace
outside
the
border
area.
what's
the
stake
in
this
case
is
whether
we
can
deal
it
within
the
border.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
but
if
this
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
without
a
warrant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
--
we
say
we
can
hold
them
here.
i
don't
see
that
is
fruitful
really
to
get
into
the
--
we
say
that
this
is
different.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
sure
as
to
what
they
thought
we
were
wrong,
but
they
would
not
attack
it.
i
take
it,
they
would
not
take
issue
with
our
contention
that
we
don't
rely
on
the
bowman
analysis
that
we
could
do
it
anyplace
in
the
country.
we're
saying
that
it
does
make
a
difference
that
we're
in
the
border
area
here.
now
the
reason
the
ninth
circuit
thought
we
were
wrong
unanimously,
i
believe
was
a
product
of
a
superficial
analysis
of
the
issues
on
their
part,
and
the
same
superficial
analysis
it’s
seems
to
me
is
contained
in
the
respondent’s
brief.
he
looks
at
the
terry
case
and
he
says
terry
requires
articulated
suspicion.
well,
the
answer
to
that
is
that
as
i've
said
before,
there
are
reasons
why
you
have
to
have
that
in
terry.
here,
we
are
dealing
with
the
situation
where
we
have
a
constitutionally
acceptable
substitute
for
particularized
suspicion.
if
you
look
at
the
camara
decision
mr.
justice
white,
they're
spelled
out
the
factors,
the
persuasive
factors
that
combined
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--the
court,
i'm
sorry,
and
then
your
opinion,
spelled
out
the
fact
that
persuasive
factors
that
combine
to
support
the
reasonableness
of
the
inspections
there.
it
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
long
history
of
judicial
and
public
acceptance.
now,
we
believe
that
the
statute
reflects
a
public
judgment
that
that
congress
has
may
on
behalf
of
the
people
that
we’re
willing
to
submit
ourselves
to
this
kind
of
intrusion
for
the
purpose
of
accomplishing
the
objective
of
preventing
illegal
entrance
from
gaining
access
to
the
interior.
second,
the
court
pointed
to
the
public
interest
that
was
at
stake
and
we've
heard
a
lot
about
that,
and
the
lack
of
other
canvassing
techniques.
now,
you've
heard
before
that
there
are
other
techniques.
we,
of
course,
are
not
going
to
give
up
our
efforts
to
detect
and
return
illegal
entrance
to
their
homeland,
even
if
the
traffic
checking
operation
is
stopped.
but
we
think
that
the
traffic
checking
operation
is
a
vital
link.
we
think
it's
the
--
it's
instrumental
not
only
in
the
people
that
captures
were
chooses
substantial
number,
but
in
the
people
that
discourages
from
attempting
to
gain
entry
into
the
united
states.
i
think
i
like
to
save
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
in
effect,
you've
just
heard
my
opponent
say
that
there
is
no
basis
on
which
we
can
constitutionally
stop
cars
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
or
any
distance
in
from
the
border.
now,
we
think
that
just
to
stop
a
car
and
ask
people
about
their
citizenship
is
a
limited
intrusion.
we
think
this
is
an
important
distinction
from
camara.
the
warrant
issue
which
i
was
unable
to
reach
in
my
opening
argument
is
treated
simply
well.
in
camara
warrant
was
required
and
therefore,
we
can't
rely
on
camara.
well
of
course
in
camara,
there
were
searching
a
--
what
was
arguably
a
home.
the
power
they
asserted
was
a
power
to
assert
homes
and
to
search
homes
and
then
see
the
power
to
search
business
premises
which
the
court
treated
as
homes.
here,
we
are
talking
about
not
a
search
but
a
stop
and
not
a
home
but
a
car.
these
factors
make
a
difference
not
only
in
the
constitutional
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment,
but
in
the
necessity
for
a
warrant.
now
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
a
warrant
is
needed,
i
think
that
--
the
answer
is
not
simply
whether
we
could
get
a
warrant.
we
have
problems
about
getting
warrants,
but
that
would
be
true
of
the
border
also.
we
could
easily
get
warrants
for
the
border.
we
could
get
warrants
that
would
say
where
we
could
setup
our
ports
of
entry,
warrants
that
would
try
to
describe
who
we
could
stop,
how
we
could
go
about
searching
people.
there
isn't
a
logical
difference
between
at
least
the
checkpoints
and
the
border
ports
of
entry
from
the
standpoint
of
could
we
get
a
warrant.
i
don't
think
the
answer
that
we
could
get
a
warrant
is
sufficient.
now,
there
are
problems
about
our
ability
to
get
a
warrant.
roving
patrol
operations
cover
amenced
variety
of
operations.
they
can
be
an
operation
like
this
totally
unexpected
due
to
bad
weather.
now,
possibly
are
san
clemente
checkpoint
warrant
could
encompass
the
authority
to
make
roving
patrol
stops.
but
we
have
other
situations,
we
have
farm
checks
during
the
harvest
season
when
we
expect
us
likely
for
migrant
workers
to
be
moving
from
farms
in
the
southern
area
to
farms
in
the
northern
area,
we
send
the
patrol
car
around
on
the
farm
roads.
we
see
a
truck
drive
by
with
the
group
of
migrant
workers;
we
may
stop
and
check
the
citizenship
of
these
people.
there
is
in
a
sense
in
issues
suppose
that
a
border
patrol
car
is
driving
along
the
road
and
it
sees
a
car
drive
by,
six
persons
who
appear
to
be
mexicans
and
i
think
that
to
ask
the
officer
to
ignore
that
fact
would
be
to
ignore
the
reasonableness
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
seating
uncomfortably
nervously
looking
away
from
him,
he's
suspicious.
he
is
--
he
can't
maybe
articulate
more
than
that
which
my
opponent
says
it's
not
enough,
but
the
question
is
can
he
just
stop
the
car
and
say
can
i
inquire
about
your
citizenship
and
make
a
brief
inquiry
of
that
nature?
now,
we
think
that’s
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
could
be
really
subjected
to
a
warrant.
in
affect,
congress
says
may
the
judgment,
the
warrant
judgment
that
we
should
be
allowed
to
do
this,
and
we
urge
this
court
to
sustain
that
judgment
and
allow
roving
patrol
stops
for
interrogation
without
warrants.
thank
you.
