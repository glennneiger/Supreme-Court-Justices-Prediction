you
say
you
relying
primarily
on
1
and/or
3?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
i'm
right
on
remembering
that
terry
against
ohio
said
in
passing
in
that
opinion
that
any
policeman
can
interrogate
anybody
about
anything
at
anytime
constitutionally?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
he
were
a
pedestrian
--
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
see
a
man
go
by
here
in
a
white
hat?
justice
potter
stewart
or
are
you
a
citizen
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
is
3
give
you
the
power
to
forcibly
detain
somebody?
justice
potter
stewart
to
board
and
search?
justice
potter
stewart
any
vessel?
justice
potter
stewart
at
any
railway
car,
aircraft
and
vans
or
vehicle?
justice
potter
stewart
board
or
search?
i
thought
rather
that
was
referring
to
the
practice
used
to
be
with
--
when
people
travel
by
ship
rather
than
by
airplane
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
going
out
beyond
ambrose
winder
--
up
to
ambrose
winder,
the
custom’s
official
boarding
the
vessel
out
there,
beyond
our
borders.
justice
potter
stewart
you
might
be
know
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
say
is
that
in
this
area
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
border,
there
is
the
generalized
justification
to
make
the
random
searchers
of
anybody
that
is
equivalent
to
the
particularized
justification
that
the
court
found
in
terry?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
its
proximate
remedy
that
border
is
now
become
a
generalized
to
support
a
random
search
of
anybody.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
equivalent
and
particularized
hunt
your
suspicion
--
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
mr.
terry
on
the
street
of
cleveland,
ohio.
justice
potter
stewart
those
old
ladies
can
be
very
suspicious
sometimes.
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
understand
now
that
you're
asserting
in
this
case
the
right
to
search
and
all
of
it’s
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
ask
questions,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
based
upon
my
reading
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
you're
relying
on
section
1357
(a)
(1),
and
you’ve
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
accuse
me
of
that
misunderstanding.
i
gather
you
made
the
different
--
the
government
made
the
different
argument
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
chicago
or
in
omaha
or
st.
louis,
you
can
--
your
people
can
walk
up
to
anybody
and
ask
him?
justice
potter
stewart
with
or
without
a
warrant?
justice
potter
stewart
the
ninth
circuit,
it's
now
settled
after
this
case
i
gather,
requires
what
it
calls
a
founded
suspicion
for
a
stop,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
the
--
you're
just
talking
about
words.
unless
you
believe
the
person
subjectively,
subjectively
believe
him
to
be
an
alien,
you
wouldn’t
stop
and
ask
him.
not,
not
--
the
statute
didn't
say
unless
it's
a
rational
grounds
for
belief
that
he's
an
alien
is
believe
by
somebody
to
be
an
alien.
and
if
he
weren't
believed
by
the
person
to
be
an
alien,
he
wouldn't

and
ask,
would
you?
justice

the

didn't
say
that.
justice

fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment.

there
had
to
be
an

generally,
you
get
a

ex
