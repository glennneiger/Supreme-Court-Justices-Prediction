justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let's
see
if
i
follow
you
there
mr.
frey.
in
other
words,
if
this
were
in
chicago,
you
wouldn't
be
defending
it?
i
think
you
say
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
said
earlier,
you
thought
there
might
be
a
distinction
between
the
old
lady
driving
the
car
and
these
people,
and
i
swear
i
don't
understand
this.
i
don't
apply
to
what
you
just
said
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
it
isn't.
