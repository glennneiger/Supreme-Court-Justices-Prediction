we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
74-175
and
74-5176,
middendorf
against
henry
and
the
consolidated
case.
mr.
zahm,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
a
member
of
the
bar
or
a
helper
of
some
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
mean
a
member
of
the
bar
or
simply
someone
to
help
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
the
“next
friend”
concept
is
what
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose,
well,
what
would
be
your
answer
to
this,
suppose
instead
of
confinement,
following
a
summary
court-martial
of
this
kind,
the
penalty
provided
was
six
months
--
loss
of
pay
for
six
months.
that
would
be
much
more
painful
perhaps
than
30
days
for
many
people,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
that
you
were
only
arguing
to
the
argersinger
point
and
not
any
penalty,
however
heavy
it
might
be.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
--
but
there,
you're
addressing
yourself
now
not
to
the
punishment,
but
to
the
proceeding
itself.
what
if
he
had
a
summary
courts-martial
and
didn't
get
any
confinement?
your
complaint
would
be
the
same
in
terms
of
your
last
point,
but
i
thought
you
were
only
arguing
about
a
confinement
case
ala
argersinger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
provisions
of
the
constitution
define
procedural
rights
in
military
justice,
on
what
provisions
of
the
constitution
relating
to
military
justice?
there
are
references
to
it
but
would
you
pinpoint
what
it
is,
the
ground?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
frey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
the
revocation
of
the
role
is
not
precisely
into
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
criminal
proceeding
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
do
you
say,
judgmental
process
to
get
away
from
the
implications
of
judicial
--
it
is
a
judgment
that's
formed
on
the
man,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
zahm,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
service,
when
a
naval
person
is
charged,
does
he
have
an
initial
option
to
take
a
general
court-martial
in
place
of
a
summary,
right
at
the
time
of
the
charge
could
he
opt
for
a
general
court-martial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
identify
the
best
possible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
the
best.
you
meant,
did
you
just
--
someone
who
is
qualified
to
help?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
if
he
picks
his
bunk
mate
and
his
bunk
mate
is
not
very
well
qualified
then,
would
you
say
he
has
made
a
waiver
of
this
“best
qualified
standard?”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
want
us
to
say
that
the
engine
room
was
better
than
the
bunkmate,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
mr.
zahm.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
stone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
claim
was
not
for
a
professionally
trained
lawyer
but
for
a
bunk
mate
or
what
was
times
in
the
old
days
called
next
friend?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
the
man
can
pick
anything,
anyone
he
wanted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
leave,
you
can
help
with
the
clerks
office
and
if
it
does
not
show
that
it
was
logged
in
to
the
court
then
will
you
provide
the
same
number
of
copies
as
you
thought
you
have
filed
in
the
first
place.
