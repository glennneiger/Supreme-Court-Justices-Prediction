unknown
speaker
the
same.
unknown
speaker
the
servicemen
opt
out
of
the
summary
court
and
have
a
general
court?
unknown
speaker
and
at
which
he
would
have
counsel?
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
not
think
that
saves
a
system
at
all.
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
man
can
plead
guilty?
plead
guilty
at
the
first
trial
and
avoid
that
trial
altogether
and
get
his
jury
trial
with
trial
de
novo?
unknown
speaker
here
he
does
not
even
have
to
plead
guilty,
he
can
go
and
have
his
general
court.
unknown
speaker
does
he
have
that
here?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
are
not
a
lawyer,
--
but
if
you
want
a
lawyer
you
can
get
it.
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
get
a
jury
trial
the
first
tier
court,
and
i
do
not
think.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
limits
on
the
jail
term
of
the
summary
court?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
30
days
only?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
why
did
they
choose
11,000
summary
courts?
unknown
speaker
there
are
11,000
instances
in
which
the
authorities
thought
that
summary
court
was
appropriate.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
means
that
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
suggesting
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
that
you
can
get
along
pretty
with
article
15.
you
do
not
need
this
confinement
possibility.
unknown
speaker
no,
11,000
instances,
the
authorities
thought
that
it
was
essential.
unknown
speaker
the
officer
is
special
or
general,
what
can
he,
for
these
same
crimes,
what
is
the
possibilities
of
the
penalty?
unknown
speaker
six
months
for
the
same,
for
exactly
the
same
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
zahm,
is
it
your
position
that
the
counsel
must
be
a
member
of
the
bar?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
confine
or
characterize
the
qualifications
that
would
be
necessary?
unknown
speaker
who
was
the
court
in
summary
court-martial?
unknown
speaker
a
single
commissioned
officer,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that
hand
holding
operation?
unknown
speaker
the
best
qualified
--
does
that
suggest
the
sailor
could
not
say
“i
want
my
bunk
mate
to
represent
me.”
unknown
speaker
should
that
be
honored
or
should
the
commanding
officer
say
no,
he
is
not
that
qualified
as
the
commanding
officer
has
its
duty.
i
want
you,
i
am
going
to
pick
someone
else,
he
cannot
have
that.
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
as
follows
if
he
wants
john
jones,
he
is
entitled
to
have
jones.
unknown
speaker
you
said
in
to
that
question,
or
to
get
into
that
question?
unknown
speaker
if,
am
i
understanding
it,
this
really
is
not
a
trial,
you
used
the
word
trial,
but
congress
said
that
it
is
not
a
trial
in
the
constitutional
sense,
in
the
anglo-
saxon
sense
of
being
an
adversary
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
ultimate
question
here
whether
that
is
within
--
whether
that
is
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
it
is
an
adversary
preceding
i
suppose
if
it
is
akin
to
a
civilian
adversary
trial
then
i
suppose
it
would
follow
that
argersinger
applies
and
counsel
is
required
but
if
--
so
the
question
is
whether
or
not
congress
has
power
under
the
constitution
and
despite
the
legal
rights
to
provide
that
at
this
level,
the
proceeding
in
the
military
shall
not
be
a
“trial”
but
shall
be
something
more
akin
to
a
continental-european
criminal
proceeding.
is
it
not
the
basic
question?
unknown
speaker
the
figures
also
show
however
that
there
was
a
decline
in
the
total
number
of
summary
courts?
unknown
speaker
these
statistics,
in
other
words
are
pretty
blunt
and
they
might
not
show
the
whole
story,
and
they
might
not
show
--
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
shared
the
first
full
year
of
change
and
the
last
full
year
previous
to
that.
unknown
speaker
argersinger
was
derived
form
gideon
v.
wainwright
which
was
based
upon
the
principle
that
basically
that
in
order
to
make
the
sides
even,
the
defendant
had
to
be
represented
by
a
counsel.
this
was
based
up
hypothesis
upon
a
model
of
anglo-american
trial
with
the
judge
sitting
on
the
bench
and
with
a
prosecutor,
with
the
defendant
over
here.
if
the
judge
was
a
lawyer
and
the
prosecutor
was
a
lawyer
and
the
defendant
was
on
counsel,
it
was
just
a
triangle
of
you
will
it
was
going
to
fall
on
its
face.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
understand
that
there
is
no
attack
on
the
summary
court-martial
as
such?
unknown
speaker
that
is
my
understanding.
but
one
certainly
could
anticipate
that
there
might
be
one.
we
have
a
case
in
which
we
grant
a
certiorari
to
be
heard
later
this
term
involving
an
attack
upon
the
constitutional
validity
of
an
ordinary
civilian
court,
the
judge
of
which
is
not
a
lawyer.
unknown
speaker
every
ship
in
the
navy
carries
an
0fficer
like
that?
unknown
speaker
okay.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
a
rather
small
commissioned
vessel
in
the
united
states
navy,
let
us
say
submarine
chaser
with
not
more
than
five
officers,
would
it
have
to
have
one
who
has
had
this
special
training?
unknown
speaker
and
you
not
only
the
problem
with
respects
to
ships
but
there
are
military
outpost
--
all
over
the
world
without
power
units.
unknown
speaker
i
am
addressing
the
point
you
made
that
the
summary
court
officer
had
to
have
some
legal
training.
that
can
be
true,
can
it
mr.
stone?
unknown
speaker
this
is
not
a
manual?
unknown
speaker
i
cannot
remember
the
last
argument
as
well
as
i
should.
what
is
the
controversy
here
now
between
this
people
and
the
military?
all
the
services
now
have
their
furnished
counsel.
unknown
speaker
the
air
force
did
it
before
the
alderman,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
was
habeas,
was
not
it?
unknown
speaker
if
all
the
services
adopt
to
this
regulation
for
the
future,
what
does
the
service
that
you
are
representing
united
states
here?
unknown
speaker
that
was
never
said
in
the
argument
the
last
time
but
that
is
--
unknown
speaker
the
decision
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
in
alderman?
unknown
speaker
so
the
only
way
you
got
here
is
because
this
sailor
went
into
the
federal
courts,
civil
courts.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
only
way
he
would.
is
there
any
way
the
government
could
have
us
reviewed,
the
court
of
military
appeals,
right?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
principle
--.
unknown
speaker
the
government
can
never
initiate
a
review.
unknown
speaker
if
the
military
back
pay
i
suppose
be
sued
in
the
court
of
claims.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
this
is
why
you
are
not
anxious
to
urge
--
as
you
always
have,
i
gather
--
(inaudible)
types
of
cases,
a
necessity
for
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
under
69.
unknown
speaker
but
you
argued
that
here
and
we
agreed
with
you
and
did
not
reach
this.
and
then
you
could
not
come
here
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
because
i
assume
they
would
follow
alderman
if
you
went
up
to
'69
movement.
unknown
speaker
well
i
have
just
been
curious
because
ordinarily
when
you
are
here
the
military
is
always
arguing
that
the
first
of
the
exhaustion
of
military—
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
getting
back
to
this
question
of
exhaustion
or
administrative
remedies
i
read
what
you
had
to
say
in
your
supplemental
brief
filed
support
in
a
memorandum
filed
october
30
and
in
there,
there
is
a
reference
to
supplemental
memorandum.
as
i
understand
it,
filed
by
your
brother,
i
do
not
have
a
copy
of
that
and
last
time
i
checked
with
the
clerks
office
it
has
not
been
filed.
perhaps
mr.
zahm
could
be
more
helpful
and
you
refered
to
it
on
footnote
9
on
page
10
of
your
supplemental
memorandum,
i
have
not
seen
it
yet.
unknown
speaker
which
i
have
not
seen.
perhaps
the
fault
of
our
clerks
office
but
this
was
filed,
was
it?
that
was
filed
some
six
weeks
ago
and
i
should
certainly
hope
that
the
members
of
this
court
have
read
that
memorandum.
unknown
speaker
i
have
not
read
it
and
i
do
not
have
it.
i
have
the
government’s
answer
to
it.
but
i
do
not
have
anything
else.
