justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
zahm.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
you're
confining
your
argument
to
loss
of
liberty.
can
a
man
go
the
brig
as
a
result
of
a
summary
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he's
in
the
brig.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
go
down
a
notch
on
the
scale
that
--
what
was
in
my
days,
now
we
call
it
company
punishment,
and
i
take
it
justice
stewart's
reference
is
to
some
sort
of
an
investigative
thing
like
that,
which
you
say
you're
not
complaining
about,
where
you
can
have
conditions
of
closed
confinement
and
supervision.
there,
the
company
commander
simply
investigates.
you're
there,
he
probably
asks
you
your
side
of
the
story,
and
what
he
ends
up
doing
is
frequently
confining
you
to
the
post
or
something
like
that.
he
may
not
put
you
on
the
stockade.
now,
there's
some
loss
of
liberty
there
and,
yet,
no
one
would
call
it
a
court.
i
don't
think
--
it
seems
to
me,
your
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
court
is
why
to
the
mark.
i
think
the
analysis
has
got
to
be
in
terms
of
loss
of
liberty.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
but
that--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
zahm,
i
find
your
reference
to
the
--
certainly,
the
first
circuit
supports
what
you
say
but,
it
seems
to
me,
that
disregards
the
whole
courts
of
civil
law
adjudication
which
we
couldn't
have
in
this
country
in
criminal
cases
because
of
the
guarantee
of
jury
trial,
but
your
judge
(inaudible)
in
your
french
courts
and
the
typical
civil
law
is
just
what
justice
powell
says
it
is.
it's
an
inquiring
magistrate
who
is
supposed
to
find
out
the
truth
and,
whereas,
you
couldn't
have
it
in
civil
proceedings
here
because
of
the
jury
trial
guarantees.
i'm
not
persuaded
that
you've
carried
any
burden
of
showing
it's
basically
unfair,
which
you
have
to
under
the
due
process
clause.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
gideon
was
retroactive.
argersinger,
i
think,
has
been
made
retroactive.
this
is
a
claim
of
right
to
counsel
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
is
there
any
really
very
persuasive
argument
that
it
shouldn't
be
retroactive
under
the
fairness
of
fact
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frey,
if
a
court
should
conclude
that
the
daigle
formula
were
the
proper
one,
i
suppose
the
navy
would
accommodate
to
it
by
appointing
counsel
in
all
cases
by
reason
of
the
workability
argument.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
the
other
situation,
if
you
want
a
jury,
you
can
get
it,
but
you
have
to
expose
your
self
to
greater
punishment.
justice
white’s
two
tier
example.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
the
differences
in
punishment
that
can
be
inflicted
under
article
15
or
company
punishment
or
whatever
you
call
it
as
opposed
to
a
summary
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
the
first
part
of
my
question,
now
how
about
the
second
part?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said
you
have
answered
the
first
part
of
my
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
compare
the
punishment
that
can
be
inflicted
by
a
special
court
with
this
article
15
punishment
as
to
outside
limits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
summary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
the
commander
thought
that
the
act
involved
warranted
some
confinement,
he
would
not
go
under
article
15.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
article
15
does
not
permit
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
function
does
the
counsel
serve?
let
us
assume
a
lay
counsel
of
about
equal
knowledge
and
sophistication
with
the
potential
defendant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
cannot
the
accused
interview
witnesses
himself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
that
the
guy
is
a,
whatever
the
naval
equivalent
of
corporal
is,
and
his
counsel
is
a
corporal.
certainly
the
accused
is
as
capable
as
a
corporal
counsel
of
interviewing
the
commanding
officer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
zahm,
we
do
not
want
us
or
the
federal
judiciary
to
get
into
the
determination
of
who
is
best,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
may
i
suggest
that
with
the
knowledge
that
now
in
a
summary
court
the
defendant
would
have
the
right
to
have
counsel
that
they
were
a
little
more
careful
about
instituting
a
summary
court
or
rather
they
might
have
turned
to
what
is
called
now
article
15,
you
used
to
call
it
captain’s
mask
instead.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
begins
with
a
hypothesis
if
a
person
on
the
bench
is
not
a
lawyer,
no
prosecutor
at
all
and
the
person
on
the
bench
whose
job
is
to
sit
on
the
bench
as
well
as
represent
this
side
as
well
as
to
represent
that
side
and
not
a
single
one.
nobody
in
the
room
was
a
lawyer;
you
begin
with
an
entirely
different
given
factual
environment
of
context,
do
you
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
due
process
at
law,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
anyone
can
anticipate
the
plan
of
the
--
that
the
court,
that
the
judge
should
be
a
lawyer.
there
is
no
attack
made
--
as
i
understand
it,
as
i
understood
mr.
zahm,
orally
and
also
in
his
brief,
there
is
no
attack
made
in
this
case
upon
the
constitutional
validity
of
a
summary
court-martial
as
such,
do
you
understand
like
wise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
look
at
these
particular
parties,
what
controversy
do
they
still
have
with
the
services?
do
they
still
have
a
sentence
to
serve
or?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
back
pay?
so
that
is
still
a
real
controversy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
has
said
that?
besides
the
lawyer
there
are
some
statement
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
question
in
these
cases
which
come
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
whether
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
in
summary
court-martial
proceedings
in
the
armed
forces.
we
conclude
that
neither
the
sixth
amendment
nor
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
required
counsel
in
such
proceedings.
in
this
case
most
of
the
plaintiffs
were
charged
with
unauthorized
absences
and
were
tried
with
their
consent
and
convected
by
navy
summary
courts-martial.
they
brought
this
class
action
in
district
court
challenging
the
authority
of
the
armed
services
to
try
them
at
summary
courts-martial
without
counsel.
the
district
court
ruled
in
their
favor.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
vacated
the
district
court’s
judgment
and
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
the
light
of
its
decision
in
an
earlier
case
in
which
it
had
held
that
though
there
was
no
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
in
summary
court-martial
proceedings,
there
was,
in
certain
cases,
a
right
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
agree
that
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
because
summary
courts-martial
proceeding
is
not
a
criminal
prosecution,
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
sixth
amendment.
it
is
a
facet
of
military
discipline
with
limited
penalties
for
charges
which
frequently
have
no
common
law
counterpart.
furthermore,
unlike
a
civilian
trail,
it
is
not
like
an
adversary
proceeding
where
counsel
is
required
to
counter
an
opposing
advocate.
we
also
hold
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
imposes
no
requirement
of
counsel
in
such
proceedings.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
on
the
appeal
of
the
plaintiffs
is
affirmed
and
the
appeal
of
the
federal
parties
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
joins.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
statement.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joins.
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
these
cases.
