justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
want
to
be
arguing
for
counsel
for
people
faced
with
that
kind
of
custody,
correctional.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
zahm,
has
the
secretary
of
the
navy
followed
the
decision
in
alderman?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
use
your
regulations
so
that,
now,
alderman
is
being
followed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
alderman
was
a
decision
of
the
military
court
of
appeals,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
merits.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
secretary
of
navy
required
to
follow
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whether
he
is
or
not,
he
is
following
it
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
at
issue
in
this
lawsuit
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
secretary
withdrawn
his
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
gather
your
point
is
that
if
he
were
to
prevail
here,
he
probably
would,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
his
regulations
are
only
on
the
compulsion
of
alderman.
if
alderman
is
reversed,
he
won't
be
under
any
compulsion.
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
ask
the
government
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
mr.
zahm,
what
is
the
present
status
of
your
clients?
where
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
--
they
aren't
in
the
brigs,
i'm
aware
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
since
it
would
serve
their
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems
to
me,
they
would
be
entitled
to
relief
and
to
retrial
or
whatever
it
is
under
the
secretary's
regulations.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
--
aren't
--
your
clients
cannot
get
the
benefit
of
the
secretary's
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
just
one
person
who,
if
you
lose,
is
going
to
suffer.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
is
a,
of
course
that's
a
a
consequence
that,
normally,
argersinger
doesn't
protect
against.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
--
you
don't
face
confinement
anymore.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
declared
to
be
such?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
class
so
is
the
class
can't
go
on
under
the
secretary's
regulations,
the
class
ends
because
there
are
no
more
people
being
deprived.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
secretary's
regulation
is
the
--
the
class
hasn't
had
anybody
added
to
whatever
since
the
secretary's
regulations
went
into
effect.
