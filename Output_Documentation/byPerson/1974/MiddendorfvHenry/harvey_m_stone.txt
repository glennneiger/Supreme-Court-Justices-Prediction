mr.
harvey
m.
stone
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
purpose
of
the
summary
court-martial
is
to
exercise
justice
promptly
for
minor
military
offenses
under
a
simple
formal
procedure.
in
keeping
with
this
intended
purpose,
congress
made
a
deliberate
decision
to
entrust
the
active
conduct
of
the
trial
to
an
impartial
court
officer
rather
than
an
opposing
counsel.
this
congressional
determination
is
entitled
to
great
deference
since
this
court
has
longed
recognized,
it
is
the
constitutional
role
of
congress
and
no
the
courts
to
strike
the
balance
between
the
rights
of
men
and
the
armed
forces
and
certain
overwriting
demands
of
discipline
and
duty.
while
the
court
has
been
careful
to
confine
court-martial
jurisdiction,
the
service
connected
offenses
committed
by
servicemen,
it
has
never
struck
down
a
deliberate
congressional
provision
governing
military
justice.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
i
think
that
is
right.
i
think
that
congress
decided
that
it
was
important
to
be
able
to
use
a
magisterial
or
inquisitorial
proceedings
for
dealing
with
the
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
i
think
that
is
the
ultimate
question.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
i
think
that
is
the
basic
question
and
our
position
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
even
if
it
results
in
jail
and
the
considerations
that
go
into
the
analysis
or
whether
the
military
has
a
significant
interest
or
whether
congress
reasonably
concluded
that
the
military
has
a
significant
interest
in
this
kind
of
procedure
plus
an
examination
of
the
fairness
of
the
procedure
and
what
is
its
stake
for
the
individual.
now
this
court’s
decision
in
parker
v.
levy
also
provides
a
framework
of
analysis
for
a
case
like
this.
there
the
court
recently
stated
that
the
fundamental
necessity
for
deceit
--
for
obedience,
and
the
consequent
necessity
for
imposition
of
discipline
may
render
permissible
within
the
military
that
which
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible
outside
it.
the
court
in
levy
reaffirmed
the
principle
that
because
of
the
unique
mission
of
the
armed
forces
many
constitutional
protections
apply
to
servicemen
in
different
degree.
there
the
court
held
that
the
proper
standard
of
review
for
a
vagueness
challenge
to
the
ucmj
even
with
respect
to
statutes
impinging
on
the
first
amendment,
is
that
which
applies
to
civilian
criminal
statues
regulating
economic
affairs.
and
we
submit
that
these
rules
governing
a
right
to
counsel
and
civilian
adversary
proceeding
cannot
be
mechanically
applied
to
courts-martial.
specifically
labels
such
as
incarceration
and
criminal
prosecution
do
not
automatically
establish
a
right
to
counsel
under
argersinger
and
related
civilian
cases
dealing
with
the
different
system
of
justice.
what
is
needed
here
rather
is
a
pragmatic
functional
analysis
of
the
problem
and
such
an
approach
we
think
reveals
that
congress
in
determining
that
this
should
be
an
inquisitorial
kind
of
procedure
rather
than
a
strictly
adversarial
procedure
has
fairly
and
reasonably
accommodated
the
private
and
governmental
interest
is
at
stake.
and
we
emphasize
first
of
all,
that
the
summary
court-martial
in
the
form
intended
by
congress
is
a
fundamentally
fair
procedure.
a
fundamental
rationale
underlying
argersinger
and
related
cases
was
that
it
is
grossly
unfair
to
pit
or
lay
accused
against
illegally
trained
prosecutor
or
anyone
who
has
experience
in
the
court
room.
in
the
summary
court-martial
of
course
there
was
no
prosecutor.
the
only
people
present
aside
from
necessary
witnesses
are
the
accused
and
the
court
officer.
the
manual
for
courts-martial
which
implements
the
code,
describes
the
basic
role
of
the
court
officer.
he
will
thoroughly
and
impartially
inquire
into
both
sides
of
the
matter
and
will
assure
that
the
interests
of
both
the
government
and
the
accused
are
safeguarded.
the
manual
also
contains
extensive
regulations
requiring
the
court
officer
to
play
an
active
role
in
helping
the
accused,
present
his
case
and
develop
his
evidence
and
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
that
the
court
officer
does
not
fulfill
that
duty.
another
concern
in
argersinger
was
the
unfairness
produced
by
the
rush
to
justice
in
civilian
misdemeanor
courts.
the
summary
court-martial
presents
no
such
problem.
all
justices
swift
the
proceeding
itself
is
dignified
and
orderly
and
there
is
no
necessity
for
assembly
line
justice.
now
if
the
presence
of
a
defense
counsel
really
improved
the
fairness
of
summary
court
proceedings
significantly,
one
would
expect
to
see
a
significant
decline
in
the
percentage
of
convictions
following
the
navy’s
implementation
of
alderman
on
june
8,
1973.
this
is
not
the
case
as
our
supplemental
brief
show
on
page
4.
except
for
the
last
few
weeks
of
fiscal
year
1973
ending
in
june
30th
1973,
counsel
was
not
provided
at
summary
courts.
during
that
fiscal
year
the
conviction
rate
at
summary
courts
was
95.2%
and
calendar
year
1974
the
last
annual
period
for
which
final
statistics
were
available.
the
percentage
of
convictions
at
summary
courts
was
93.6%.
this
figure
represents
a
decline
of
only
1.6%
as
compared
to
fiscal
year
1973
and
of
course
we
cannot
be
certain
that
the
presence
of
defense
counsel
at
summary
courts
has
actually
caused
this
1.6%
decline
in
the
percentage
of
convictions.
but
even
if
there
is
a
casual
connection
the
1.6%
decline
does
not
necessarily
indicate
that
the
presence
of
counsel
has
improved
fairness
or
accuracy
of
the
fact
finding
process.
now
argersinger
by
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
yes
there
was
a
decline
in
the
total
number
of
summary
courts.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
that
is
possible,
it
also
possible
that
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
it
is
hard
to
say
with
certainty
what
the
statistics
mean.
there
could
have
--their
statistic
show
that
with
the
new
rules
there
was
a
decline
in
the
use
of
summary
courts
and
a
shift
towards
the
article
15
on
judicial
punishment
as
well
as
a
shift
towards
special
cords
and
it
is
very
hard
to
say
what
the—
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
well
the
statistics—
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
we
picked
out
the
last
annual
year
for
which
statistics
are
available.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
the
year
before
represents
approximately
the
same
plan.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
no,
i
think
our
supplemental
brief
has
a
breakdown
of
the
statistics.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
it
is
in
the
supplemental
brief,
where
is
that?
on
page
4.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
the
year
before
that
revealed
a
percentage
of
convictions
that
showed
a
slightly
lesser
decline.
so
we
picked
out
statistics
that
were—
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
we
are
using
one
year,
the
year
before
the
new
rules
compared
to
the
last
final
year
for
which
statistics
available
can
relate
it.
the
trend
reflects
the
same
pattern
that
we
show
here.
we
could
have
picked
the
year
immediately
after
the
new
rule
that
would
have
been
slightly
more
favorable
to
us.
but
we
took
the
last
final
year
for
which
statistics
were
available---
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
the
year
before
calendar
year
1974,
shows
that
the
percentage
of
convictions
was
down
just
slightly
more
than
the
year
before
the
new
rules
began.
the
year
that
we
picked
out
show
statistics
that
are
unfavorable
to
us
because
they
show
more
of
an
increase
in
the
difference
between
the
two.
and
that
is
why
we
picked
that
out,
to
avoid
the
complaint
that
we
are
picking
out
the
year
that
is
most
favorable
to
us.
we
picked
out
the
year
that
was
least
favorable
to
us
in
that
sense.
now
argersinger
by
contrast
seems
to
have
been
premised
on
the
notion
that
the
presence
of
defense
counsel
and
civilian
criminal
prosecutions
would
help
the
accused
in
a
major
percentage
of
cases.
indeed
at
one
point
at
page
36,
the
court
referred
to
a
study
which
concluded
that
misdemeanants
represented
by
attorneys
are
five
times
as
likely
to
emerge
from
police
court
with
all
charges
dismissed
as
our
defendants
who
face
similar
charges
without
counsel.
what
is
now
turned
to
the
military
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
that
is
part
of
our
basic
point.
argersinger
was—
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
yes,
it
is
a
different
system.
and
argersinger
was
premised
on
the
notion
that
there
had
to
be
an
evenness
in
representation,
it
was
unfair
to
have
an
accused
who
was
opposed
by
someone
who
was
trained
in
the
court
even
if
he
was
not
a
legally
trained
prosecutor,
our
point
that
this
system
is
it
is
a
balanced
procedure.
and
indeed
the
injection
of
defense
counsel
onto
these
proceedings
the
argument
might
be
made,
distorts
the
previous
balance
and
could
even,
assuming
that
there
is
still
no
prosecutor
which
there
is
not
at
this
point
could
even
prompt
the
court
officer
into
a
prosecutorial
role.
he
may
be
thinking
that
he
should
protect
the
prosecution
now
more
than
the
defense
since
the
defense
is
already
represented
by
a
lawyer.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
he
is
not
supposed
to
do
that.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
he
is
supposed
to
represent
the
interest
of
both
sides
but
there
have
been
cases
that
held
that
--
but
you
have
a
system
in
which
you
have
a
defense
counsel
representing
the
defendant
and
you
have
a
judge
who
was
supposed
to
be
judge
and
prosecutor
that
can
present
problems.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
summary
court-martial
was
unfair
as
its
structure
today,
i
think
it
was
fairer
the
way
it
was
before,
i
am
just
saying
it
would
not
be
surprising
to
see
claims
made.
that
the
proceedings
are
now
not
properly
balanced
because
of
the
presence
of
defense
counsel
and
it
is
not,
i
think
that
claim
is
no
less
persuasive
than
the
claim
made
today,
that
it
is
not
fair
and
the
result
of
that
could
be
some
judicial
rule
that
prosecutors
also
be
required
at
summary
courts-martial
and
then
you
would
really
have
a
strictly
adversary—
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
no,
but
i
am
just
taking
the
analysis
one
step
further
to
show
that
it
is
unwise
to
start
requiring
a
defense
counsel
in
here
because
the
basic
point
of
the
summary
court
is
that
its
originally
a
balanced
procedure
and
i
am
anticipating
claims
by
defendants
perhaps
in
the
future
that
could
be
made.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
his
attack
is
that
the
defendant
needs
a
counsel.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
that
is
correct.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
well,
i
will
say
this
about
the
summary
court
officer,
he
does
have
training,
legal
training
and
that
he
is
experienced
in
these
matters.
he
is
not
a
lawyer,
that
is
if
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
every
ship?
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
they
are
on
ships.
they
were
officers
able
who
can
conduct
summary
courts.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
well,
the
rules
that
are
in
effect
now
only
make
room
for
military
exigencies
and
what
is
reasonably
available.
but
i
cannot
say
that
on
every
ship
that
a
summary
court
martial,
there
will
be
a
summary
court-martial
officer
who
necessarily
has
that
training.
i
just
think
so.
the
article
15
however
is
used
on
a
ship,
perhaps
for
that
reason
and
an
accused
cannot
even
refuse
on
article
15
on
a
ship.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
there
are
man
power
problems
which—
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
he
is
not
required
to
have
legal
training
but
as
a
practical
matter
he
has
to
be
familiar
with
this
system
and
he
is
given
books
which
he
has
to
study,
trial
guides
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
manual?
this
is
not
equivalent
to
law
school.
but
he
has
to
become
experienced
with
this
system
and
he
receives
some
training,
it
has
to
study
this
books
and
discuss
the
process
before
he
conducts
the
court.
i
wanted
to
turn
to
the
military
interest
in
eliminating
the
requirement
of
defense
counsel
at
summary
court-martial
which
is
--
our
main
argument
here
is
really
not
the
man
power
problem
but
something
quite
different.
the
military
does
obviously
have
a
special
interest
in
prompt
and
formal
methods
of
discipline
for
minor
offenses,
like
article
15
proceedings.
the
summary
court
is
designed
to
regulate
a
vastly
greater
proportion
of
the
service
man’s
life
and
would
be
subject
to
regulation
in
civilian
society.
the
purpose
of
the
summary
court
is
not
only
to
deter
misconduct
but
also
to
instill
a
positive
sense
of
discipline
and
to
return
the
accused
quickly
to
his
military
duties.
these
aspects
of
the
summary
court
reflect
this
special
relationship
of
the
government
to
its
servicemen
described
in
parker
v.
levy.
unlike
the
civilian
situation
the
court
stated
the
government
is
often
a
employer,
landlord,
provisioner
and
law
giver
rolled
into
one.
the
presence
of
defense
counsel
who
is
bound
by
professional
duty
to
develop
every
argument
favorable
to
its
client
as
to
what
are
the
purposes
of
summary
court-martials
in
several
ways.
first
of
all,
it
formalizes
and
rigidifies
the
proceedings.
and—
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
i
think,
i
understand
mr.
zahm’s
claim
to
include
something
slightly
more
than
that,
that
he
wants
a
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
he
can
pick
anyone
he
wanted
but
if
he
wants
someone
with
some
reasonable
training
he
may
be
entitled
to
have
--
representation
by
some
officer
who
has
some
experience
in
this
system.
as
the
systems
operates
now,
the
military
has
simply
been
providing
lawyers
if
they
are
available
and
if
not
other
people
who
have
training
in
the
system.
my
most
important
concern
with
respect
to
the
military
interest
here
is
that
the
presence
of
defense
counsel
has
apparently
caused
substantial
delay
in
the
disposition
of
charges
and
thus
counter
act
that
the
congressional
objective
of
swift
reaction
to
minor
offenses.
as
we
show
on
page
4
of
our
supplemental
brief
and
again
the
figures
are
not
conclusive,
they
merely
tend
to
support
our
point.
the
presence
of
defense
counsel
has
coincided
with
the
marked
increased
in
the
average
time
span
between
referral
of
charges
and
final
review.
and
it
may
be
that
the
factors
other
that
the
presence
defense
counsel
has
added
to
this
delay.
but
it
seems
reasonable
to
infer
that
the
presence
of
defense
counsel
has
been
the
main
cause
of
the
delay.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
following
alderman
they
provide
counsel
because
there
are
bound
by
alderman
at
this
point.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
the
air
force
did
even
then
and
this
is
something
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
relied
on
as
we
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
no
they
have
competed
their
sentence
but
when
they
came
in
to
the
district
court
they
were
still
in
confinement
and
what
is
at
stake
for
them
is
a
back
pay
and
a
conviction.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
well
in
our
view,
the
case
is
not
moot
because
of
the
fact
that
they
came
in
to
the
district
court
when
they
were
still
is
confinement
under
kourafas.
and
it
would
be
very
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
the
holding
in
cora
fus
that
i
refer
to
was
that
if
you
enter
the
district
court
and
you
are
in
confinement,
jurisdiction
of
the
court
does
not
terminate
simply
because
the
custody
terminates.
and
these
people
we
are
talking
about
a
system
in
which
people
are
sentenced
to
very
short
periods
of
confinement.
and
very
quickly
they
are
going
to
be
released
from
confinement
and
on
that
basis
it
is
very
difficult
to
the
court.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
right,
the
services
only
adopted
these
regulations
because
they
are
bound
by
alderman,
if
the
government
wins
this
case
the
army
and
the
navy
are
going
to
resent
their
regulations.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
yes,
in
the
beginning
of
mr.
froy's
argument
last
time
we
said
the
navy
is
going
to
resent.
subsequently
we
found
out
that
the
army
is
going
to
resent
and
i
think
that
is
very
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
yes.
i
am
advised
from
the
judge
advocate
general
of
the
navy
who
communicated
with
judge
advocate
general
of
the
army
that
that
is
going
to
happen.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
we
do
because
it
conflicts
with
the
congressional
judgment.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
no,
it
is
important
for
the
military
that
we
not
follow
it
because
it
has
diminished
the
utility
of
these
procedures.
it
has
increased
the
time
for
the
disposition
of
charges
by
something
like
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
no,
but
that
is
not
the
problem.
we
could
--
anything
that
affects
military
discipline
and
under
well
recognized
principles,
a
delay
in
the
imposition
of
punishment
can
lessen
the
corrective
impact
of
punishment.
we
are
talking
ultimately
about
the
army's
preparedness
to
fight
or
be
ready
to
fight
war
should
the
occasion
arise.
that
is
what
this
court
has
always
defined
as
the
primary
task
of
the
armed
forces.
and
when
we
are
talking
about
matters
of
military
discipline.
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about
and
that
is
why
the
congressional
judgment
is
entitled
to
such
deference
in
these
matters.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
no,
we
could
not
come
directly.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
that
is
right.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
direct,
yes.
a
decision
which
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
the
government
can
initiate
a
review
if
id
has
lost
in
the
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
yes,
it
could
possibly
come
up
indirectly
through
some
fashion
like
that
which
we
have
no
control
over.
but
if
i
may
talk
about
alderman
for
a
minute
--.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
and
we
think
they
are
very
exceptional
circumstances
--
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
right
but
in
our
supplemental
brief
we
set
out
our
argument
why
there
are
various
special
circumstances—
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
here
our
decision
not
towards
exhaustion
was
based
on
the
record
in
this
case
primarily.
the
added
delay
in
imposition
of
punishment
which
averages
out
now
to
about
a
13
day
additional
period
comparing
the
year
before
alderman
to
the
current
year
is
a
very
damaging
to
military
interests,
primarily
it
renders
the
summary
court-martial
in
more
cumbersome
procedure
and
prevents
the
government
from
imposing
punishment
quickly.
but
it
also
the
13
day
period
of
unresolved
charges
can
be
a
damaging,
can
have
a
adverse
psychological
effect
on
the
accused
and
in
some
instances,
it
can
render
him
temporarily
ineligible
for
transfer
or
security
clearance
and
that
is
another
consideration.
that
ultimately
has
to
do
with
the
army’s
preparedness
to
fight
wars.
the
decline
of
the
use
of
summary
courts
has
been
causing
a
proportional
shift
towards
other
procedures
and
to
that
extent
we
suggest
that
the
diminished
utility
of
summary
courts
has
upset
the
entire
system
of
military
justice
designed
by
congress.
and
the
summary
court-martial
fills
an
important
gap
between
the
article
15
non-judicial
punishment
proceeding
below
it
and
the
special
court-martial
above
it.
it
is
an
option
that
is
advantageous
to
both
the
government
and
sometimes
to
the
accused.
the
government
might
want
to
convene
a
summary
court
if
previous
article
15
proceedings
have
failed
to
generate
obedience
over
a
particular
accused.
the
accused
might
want
a
summary
court
if
he
has
had
run-ins
with
his
commanding
officer
in
article
15
and
he
may
prefer
this
kind
of
procedure.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
the
commanding
officer
imposes
punishment
but—
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
right.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
you
can
get
something
called
correctional
custody.
but
the
point
of
the
summary
court-martial
and
why
it
would
be
used—
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
except
on
ships.
you
can
put
him
in
the
brig
for
three
days.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
but
you
cannot
generally.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
no,
you
cannott
give
him
any
confinement.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
i
do
not
follow
that
the
special
court
has
no
more
due
process
the
special
court
is
a
entirely
different
procedure.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
it
is
more
due
process
but
there
is
the
captain’s
mask,
the
commanding
officer
has
enormous
discretion,
he
can
listen
to
the
various
witnesses
and
impose
a
summary
punishment
and
in
the
summary
court
the
court
officer
has
bound
by
regulations,
protect
the
interest,
their
formal
rules
of
evidence,
he
has
reasonable
doubts
standard.
he
is
an
impartial
fact
finding
officer
and
because
of
that
he
is
able
to
impose
greater
penalties
could
be
imposed.
in
article
15
proceeding
that
is
the
basic
progression
here
shows
that
with
each
tier
within
the
military
justice
system
and
there
are
four
tiers
as
you
go
higher
up,
the
procedures
become
more
elaborate
and
the
punishments
authorized
are
more
severe.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
summary
court?
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
before
alderman
from
referral
of
charges
to
final
review
it
took
32.5
days.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
the
hearing
itself
is
relatively
short
but
punishment
cannot
be
imposed.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
probably
not
too
much
different
in
the
hearing
itself
but
the
whole
the
process
takes
more
time
and
punishment
cannot
be
imposed
until
final
review
is
completed.
i
think
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
our
supplemental
memorandum
here,
part
of
it
was
written
in
response
to
their
supplemental
memorandum.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
i
would
certainly
recommend
that
you
read
it.
mr.
harvey
m.
stone
i
certainly
will.
thank
you,
your
honor.
