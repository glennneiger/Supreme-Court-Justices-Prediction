mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
facts
of
these
particular
consolidated
cases
are
simple
and
are
not
in
dispute.
the
named
plaintiffs
were
marines
stationed
at
el
toro
marine
base
near
los
angeles,
california.
they
were
all
in
pay
grades
e1-e4,
the
lowest
pay
grades
in
military
services
and,
therefore,
subject
to
summary
court-martial
under
article
20
of
the
uniform
code
military
justice
and,
if
convicted,
they
could
stand
confin
--
they
would
be
confined
for
up
to
30
days
and
five
of
the
named
plaintiffs
were
so-convicted
and
sentenced
to
--
up
to
30
days
respectively
for
various
minor
offenses.
and,
at
their
summary
courts-martial,
they
did
not
have
their
own
retained
or
--
their
own
retained
counsel
nor
were
they
appointed
counsel.
three
of
the
named
plaintiffs
were
ordered
to
stand
trial
subject
at
the
summary
courts-martial.
those
trials
were
not
yet
convened
at
the
time
the
action
was
brought
but
they,
too,
were
advised
that
they
would
not
have
appointed
counsel
at
summary
courts-martial.
a
class
action,
worldwide
in
scope,
was
brought
for
habeas
corpus
relief
of
the
five
imprisoned
as
result
of
the
summary
courts-martial
convictions
and
sentenced,
and
there
was
a
prayer
for
relief
in
the
nature
of
mandamus,
also
for
injunction
against
the
topmost
officials
of
the
navy
and
the
marine
corps.
and,
the
named
plaintiffs'
commanding
officers
at
el
toro
marine
base
requiring
the
relief
--
required
that
the
accused
servicemen
at
summary
courts-martial
resulting
in
confinement
be
provided
the
opportunity
to
have
the
assistance
of
defense
counsel
who
does
not
also
represent
the
prosecution
and,
in
the
district
court,
all
of
the
--
this
requested
relief
was
granted.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
pardon,
your
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
in
all
of
this
discussion,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
are
referring
as
counsel
being
not
necessarily
a
lawyer,
but
a
person
who,
in
some
degree
at
least,
might
be
of
assistance
to
the
accused.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
the
“next
friend”
might
be
a
proper
term,
your
honor,
yes.
there
have
been
cases
which
we
could
go
into
later
if
the
court
pleases
where
the
military
court
of
the
highest
nature,
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals,
is
determined
that,
constitutionally
speaking,
unless
congress
has
otherwise
required,
counsel
does
not
mean
lawyer
counsel
and
so
here,
we,
in
this
case,
are
speaking
of
counsel
from
the
constitutional
standpoint
of
being
a
person
who
assists
the
accuse
at
trial
who
is
not
necessarily
lawyer-counsel.
at
any
rate,
the
district
court
in
this
case
granted
habeas
corpus
relief
to
those
who
had
been
confined,
and
issued
relief
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
on
a
worldwide
level.
now,
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
holding
of
this
court
in
argersinger
versus
hamlin,
407
u.s.
in
the
year
1972,
in
which
this
court
held
in
a
landmark
decision
that
an
accuse
in
any
criminal
prosecution
for
whatever
offense,
petty
or
otherwise,
may
not
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
if
he
was
denied
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
trial
and,
this,
by
virtue
of
the
right
to
assistance
of
counsel
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment
and
also
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
your
honor,
it
might
be
more
painful,
we
might
agree.
but,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
argersinger,
we
are
limited
to
the
decision
of
this
court
with
reference
to
loss
of
liberty.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
most
specifically,
your
honor,
we
are
in
this
case
limiting
ourselves
to
the
decision
of
this
court
in
argersinger
with
regard
to
loss
of
liberty.
now,
this
question,
of
course,
would
never
have
arisen
with
regard
to
any
other
kind
of
courts-martial
in
the
military
for
the
reason
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
seen
to
it
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
that,
in
the
general
court-martial
and
the
special
court-martial,
defense
counsel
shall
be
provided
the
accused.
and
so,
the
problem
arises,
therefore,
only
with
regard
to
summary
court-martial
because,
under
article
20
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
no
provision
is
made
in
that
article
for
defense
counsel
for
the
accused
such
as
in
the
case
of
general
court-martial
and
special
court-martial.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
most
positively,
he
may
be
confined
in
the
brig
for
up
to
30
days,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
problem
here
that
these
named
plaintiffs
and
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
others
in
the
class.
under
summary
courts-martial,
not
only
maybe
confined
for
up
to
30
days
but
for
some
perhaps
200
years
have
been
so-confined.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
i
would
have
to
say
that
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
under
captain's
mast,
as
we
refer
to
it
in
the
navy,
and
i
am
a
former
navy
man
myself,
captain's
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
yes.
captain's
mast,
as
we
refer
to
it
today,
is
referred
more
technically
as
proceedings
under
article
15,
non-judicial
administrative
punishment.
correctional
custody
is
what
might
result
from
a
captain's
mast
from
article
15.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
it
would
still
be,
even
at
chip
at
sea,
would
be
correctional
custody
and
not
confinement.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
i
would
have
to
say
he
is
not
in
the
brig,
to
my
knowledge.
correctional
custody,
he
will
be
still
in
the
position
of
performing
his
regular
duties
but
under
a
very
strict
guidance
and
counseling,
as
the
distinction
is
made
to
my
knowledge,
in
the
navy.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
he
is
not
in
the
brig.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
well,
at
the
present
time,
i'm
satisfied
to
be
arguing
strictly
on
the
matter
of
summary
courts-martial
because,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
will
be
getting
to
it.
the
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
originally,
it
was
called
a
deck
court.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
yes.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
well,
my
only
difference
would
be
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
--
from
a
historical
standpoint,
i
believe
by
the
time
of
world
war
ii
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
we
had
summary
court
as
we
have
it
today.
historically
speaking,
the
first
one-man
court,
which
is
what
a
summary
court
is,
a
one-officer
court.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
yes,
originally.
it
started
in
1909.
so,
the
concept
of
a
one-officer
court
is
only
that
old,
since
1909.
it
does
not
date
back
to
the
revolutionary
war
period
or
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
that
is
correct,
originally.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
they
changed
the
name.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
yes.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
that
is
correct.
the
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
the
summary
court
that
we
revert
to
today
and
the
one
to
which
great
objection
is
made
in
this
suit
and
by
the
authorities
and
by
the
commentators,
is
the
one-officer
court
who
is
serving
as
the
judge,
as
the
prosecutor
and,
to
some
extent,
if
at
all,
assistance
of
defense
to
the
accused.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
he
is
serving
in
a
tri-partite
manner,
and
this
is
called
a
court
where
one
man
is
serving
as
the
judge,
if
you
will,
the
jury,
and
the
prosecutor.
and,
in
this
court
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
whatever
the
nomenclature,
your
honor,
it
is
a
single
man
serving
in
--
under
three
hats
at
the
same
time
presuming
to
be
a
court.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
no.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
your
honor,
that
is
not
correct
under
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
because
a
summary
courts-martial
is
a
court.
it
is
not
an
investigation.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
conviction
puts
him
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
your
honor,
that
is
precisely
the
point.
whatever
you
call
it,
whatever
nomenclature,
it
is
a
decision
by
the
court,
a
military
court,
in
which,
upon
conviction,
the
man
loses
his
liberty
just
as
the
civilian
indigent
under
this
court's
ruling
in
argersinger
loses
his
liberty.
whether
it
be
for
a
moment,
an
hour,
or
a
day,
the
result
is
the
same.
the
question--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
your
honor,
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
has
decided
on
this
very
question,
the
distinction
between
proceedings
under
an
article
15
and
summary
courts-martial
and,
most
positively,
this
is
the
court
incidentally
which
this
court
in
noyd
versus
bond
said
we
look
to
for
the
development
of
military
expertise.
well,
that
court
with
its
military
expertise
sees
a
tremendous
significant
difference
between
proceedings
under
article
15
and
summary
for
the
following
reasons.
that,
under
article
15,
there
is
no
conviction
of
crime,
so
to
speak,
of
military
crime
on
the
man's
record.
the
explosive
effects
of
a
conviction
under
summary
courts-martial
may
be
drastic,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
due
to
the
escalator
clauses
that
we
find
in
the
military
regulations.
two
convictions
of
summary
courts-martial,
when
later
brought
up
at
a
special
court-martial,
may
result
very
positively
in
a
bad
conduct
discharge
with
the
result
that,
for
the
rest
of
the
man's
life,
in
and
out
of
service
he
suffers
a
tremendous
lifetime
economic
disability.
none
of
that
accrues
as
the
result
of
any
number,
any
number
of
article
15
proceedings.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
your
honor,
if,
as
we
feel
this
court
should
rule,
making
argersinger,
if
you
will,
the
requirements
of
argersinger
apply
to
the
military,
then
the
navy
would
either
appoint
counsel
for
the
man
in
summary
courts-martial
or
not.
if
they
did
not,
the
man
would
not
have
a
conviction,
you
see,
to
confinement.
and,
without
that,
the
escalator
clause
would
not
apply
to
the
future.
so,
therefore,
he
would
not
suffer
in
that
regard.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
now
the
basic
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
he
may
reject
the
summary
courts-martial
under
article
20.
you're
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
he
may
reject
it.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
then
he
will
either
have
the
charges
dismissed
or
he
will
subject
himself
to
trial
court-martial,
special
court-martial,
or
even
general
court-martial.
and,
as
a
result
of
that,
the
possibilities
of
his
punishment,
of
his
confinement,
will
be
tremendously
greater
than
if
he
had
taken
summary
courts-martial.
the
distinction
being
that
if
he's
opts
for
the
special
or
the
general,
he
will
have
the
opportunity
to
have
the
assistance
of
defense
counsel.
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
perhaps
why
he
would
take
the
greater
risk,
if
you
will,
of
greater
punishment
in
order
to
get
his
constitutional
right
of
the
assistance
of
counsel.
that
would
be
perhaps
the
only
basis
for
his
taking
that
risk,
if
you
will.
what
he
does
by
not
opting
to
reject
his
summary
courts-martial
is
to
feel
that
he
does
not
wish
to
take
the
risk
of
even
greater
punishment.
better,
i
should
get
in
the
brig
for
30
days
and
all
the
rest
of
the
punishment
that
may
accrue
later
in
life
than
to
have
an
even
greater
punishment.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
when
we
study,
your
honor,
the
provisions
of
the
manual
of
courts-martial
as
to
the
functions
of
the
summary
court
officer,
we
find
that
he
is
to
be
the
prosecutor.
the
language
used
in
the
manual
of
courts-martial
requires
him
to
do
the
same
as
a
trial
counsel
at
a
general
court-martial
or
a
special
court-martial,
including
the
obtaining
of
witnesses
for
the
prosecution
against
the
accused,
the
questioning,
the
interrogation,
the
cross-examination
of
those
witnesses
and,
in
every
sense
therefore,
he
must
in
fact
be
doing
what
a
prosecutor
would
be
doing.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
he
must
do
that,
but
this
is
the
very
problem
and
the
criticism
of
the
summary
courts-martial
that
has
been
exempted
by
all
authorities
for
many
years.
he
must
do
all
of
those
things
and,
in
the
first
circuit
case
of
figueroa
ruiz
versus
delgado
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
the
court
says,
it
was
a
puerto
rican
district
court
that
points
out,
that
it
is
literally
impossible
for
a
man
to
be
a
judge
and
function
to
whatever
degree
as
a
prosecutor.
he
just
simply
cannot
successfully
do
it.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
well,
perhaps
so,
they
are
administrative
tribunals
but,
here,
we're
speaking
of
courts
of
law
where
men
are
subject,
upon
conviction,
to
loss
of
liberty,
your
honor,
which
this
court
thought
in
the
landmark
case
of
iverson,
no
matter
how
petty
the
offense,
he
deserves
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
trial.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
your
honor,
mr.
justice
powell,
may
i
suggest,
under
820,
a
summary
court
consists
of
one
officer,
that's
one
individual.
the
only
other
person
physically
in
that
courtroom,
therefore,
is
the
accused,
obviously,
and
perhaps
any
other
witnesses
who
may
have
been
called
as
witnesses.
now,
somebody
has
to
prosecute
that
case
against
the
accused.
we
certainly
can't
expect
that
the
accused
will
be
serving
as
the
prosecutor
against
himself.
somebody
has
to
be
acting
as
prosecutor
and,
obviously,
by
the
very
regulations
of
the
manual
of
courts-martial,
that
is
the
man
who
is
also
serving
as
judge,
the
man
who
will
find
whether
or
not
the
accused
is
guilty
or
innocent.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
under
the
due
process
clause,
this
court
has
enunciated
in
gideon
versus
wainwright
that
the
rule
of
betts
versus
brady,
the
case
by
case
approach
for
determination
of
proper
due
process,
does
not
apply
in
criminal
prosecutions.
that
the
per
se
rule,
the
absolute
standard,
of
right
to
counsel
applies
in
criminal
prosecutions.
courts-martials
are
criminal
prosecutions
and
so,
following
the
dictates
of
this
court
in
gideon,
it
would
appear
that
the
due
process
rights
in
a
summary
courts-martial
calls
for
assistance
of
counsel
in
every
case.
now,
if
i
may
say
at
this
juncture,
this
is
where
we
feel
this
court
should
not
affirm
the
view
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
daigle
case
where
the
due
process
test
applied
there
differently
from
the
test
applied
by
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
betonie
versus
sizemore
case,
where
the
absolute
standard
of
due
process
is
applied
in
a
criminal
prosecution
which
means,
to
every
accused
in
a
summary
courts-martial,
this
is
the
following
of
this
court's
precept
as
indicated
in
gideon
versus
wainwright.
and,
since
argersinger
is
an
extension
of
gideon
versus
wainwright,
we
maintain
that
this
court
should
follow
by
the
way
what
even
the
government
previously
has
argued
this
term
before
this
court
that
the
decisions,
because
of
its
special
expertise
of
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals,
should
be
followed
by
this
very
court
was
the
argument
in
the
case
this
term
by
the
government.
we
merely
suggest
that
it
is
correct
that
the
decisions
of
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
should
be
followed
because
they
know
best
what
is
needed
by
the
military
and
they
decided
this
issue
in
united
states
versus
alderman.
and,
in
united
states
versus
alderman,
the
majority
of
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
ruled
that
the
requirements
of
argersinger
apply
to
the
military,
and
i
have
not
yet
have
the
opportunity
to
say,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
these
plaintiffs
recognize
that
military
necessity,
to
a
great
degree
determines
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
rights
of
men
in
service
are
retained
by
those
men
when
they
damn
the
uniform.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
well,
your
honor,
ever
since
burns
versus
wilson,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1953,
there
have
been
multitude
of
cases
in
the
lower
federal
courts
and
by
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
following
burns
versus
wilson
which,
in
effect,
say
that
except
for
those
specific
exemptions
from
the
bill
of
rights
and
those
that
are
necessary
to
be
implied,
all
constitutional
rights
belong
to
men
in
service
as
well
as
men
not
in
service.
and,
the
one
single
expressed
exception,
as
this
court
through
mr.
justice
douglas
has
indicated
in
parker
versus
levy
in
his
dissent,
the
only
expressed
exception
is
the
indictment
by
a
grand
jury.the
only
implied
exception
has
been
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
other
than
that,
there
is
no
other
exception
other
than
in
the
application
of
rights
to
the
military
man
and
in
this
--
this
court
only
last
term,
in
parker
versus
levy,
implicitly
stated
what
i
have
just
said
and,
in
that
particular
case
with
regard
to
first
amendment
principles,
this
court
said
that
the
right
of
a
serviceman
with
regard
to
first
amendment
has
to
be,
in
some
way,
different
from
that
of
a
civilian
because
of
the
special
needs
of
the
military.
we
recognize
that.
the
navy,
although
the
courts
in
which
this
matter,
this
issue,
has
been
litigated,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
before
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals,
the
district
courts
in
hawaii,
in
california,
in
the
ninth
circuit
has
argued
that
military
necessity
requires
that
there'd
be
no
counsel
appointed
at
summary
courts-martial.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
the
secretary
of
the
navy?
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
that
is
correct.
he
did
do
exactly
what
you
ask
me.
in
june
of
1973,
following
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals,
the
navy
sent
out
an
l-map
worldwide
that
the
decision
of
alderman
shall
be
followed
and
so
we
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
that
is
correct.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
the
answer
to
that,
to
my
knowledge,
is
yes.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
and
never
has
been
ever
since
june
1973.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
the
issue
is
that
the
navy
wants
this
court
to
overrule
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
which
is
asking
this
court
to
do,
to
my
knowledge,
for
the
first
time
in
history
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
he
has
not.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
the
supposition
is,
your
honor,
that
if
this
court
should
rule
contrary
to
the
way
plaintiffs
here
request,
you
would
be,
in
effect,
be
overruling
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
may
i,
at
this
point
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
pardon?
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
yes.
may
i
point
out
at
this
juncture
that
when
the
argersinger
decision
came
from
this
court
in
may
--
excuse
me,
in
--
yes,
in
may
--
i
think
it
was
may
or
june
of
1972,
the
army
and
the
air
force,
within
weeks
and
without
anyone
other
than
their
own
commands
requesting
it,
immediately
followed
the
procedures
as
required
by
argersinger.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
well
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
no.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
a
number
of
them
were
released
under
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
issued
by
judge
williams
in
the
district
court.
others
either
had
served
their
time
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
as
my
--
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor,
the
navy
does
not
provide
for
retrial.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
well,
for
them,
it
was
too
late
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
a
number
of
them
are
already
out
of
service,
they
either
have
served
their
time.
their
relief,
if
we
win
here
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
their
records
will
remain
as
being
--
showing
that
they're
conviction
of
a
summary
courts-martial
and
if
they're
still
in
service,
they
may
suffer
from
the
escalator
clauses
later
and,
as
a
civilian,
this
is
on
their
record,
you
see.
they
lost
pay
which
they
otherwise
may
theoretically
at
least
ask
for
it
to
be
recompensed.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
but,
your
honor,
may
i
say
that
the
concern
here
is
not
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
not
these
named
plaintiffs
but,
if
i
may
point
out,
your
honor,
this
action
was
brought
as
a
class
action,
habeas
corpus
class
action
worldwide
and
also
in
the
form
of
mandamus.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
by
the
district
court,
yes,
and
never
undone
by
the
appellate
court.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
unless
this
court
rules
otherwise.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
not
since
then,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
since
these
consolidated
cases
are
hear
on
re-argument
today,
it
would
seem
unnecessary
and
more
expeditious
to
refrain
from
repeating
the
facts
of
the
case
which
are
undisputed
and
are
relatively
simple.
suffice
to
say
that
in
a
routine
manner,
the
petitioners,
members
of
the
marine
core
were
up
on
charges
on
courts-martial.
five
of
them
were
convicted
and
incarcerated
as
a
result.
three
others
were
facing
courts-martial
and
sought
relief
by
way
of
injunction
to
prevent
it.
now,
we
ask
this
court
to
affirm
that
the
sixth
amendment
guarantee
of
assistance
of
counsel
in
criminal
prosecutions,
which
was
this
court’s
principal
basis
for
its
ruling
in
argersinger
versus
hamlin
in
1972,
also
applies
to
persons
in
military
service.
every
court
that
has
ever
considered
the
question
including
the
court
of
military
appeals
in
united
states
v.
culp,
united
states
versus
tempia
in
1967,
and
more
recently
united
states
v.
alderman
in
1973
has
so
held
with
the
single
exception,
that
being
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
daigle
v.
warner,
which
has
petition
pending
here.
sub
nom
crosby
versus
warner.
now,
the
federal
parties
have
asked
this
court
for
the
first
time
ever
to
overrule
the
united
states
court
of
military
appeals
on
this
issue,
in
favor
of
a
single
civilian
court’s
view.
despite
this
court’s
repeated
recognition
over
the
years
and
repeated
only
last
term,
in
schlesinger
versus
councilman,
that
coma
is
the
court
established
by
congress
to
gain
over
time
thorough
familiarity
with
military
problems.
now
for
this
court
to
do
would
undermine
the
court
of
military
appeals,
very
significant
role
as
the
supreme
court
of
the
military
which
has
been
designated
to
be.
now,
the
only
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit’s
holing
on
this
question
of
the
sixth
amendment’s
application
to
the
military
is
based
on
single
historical
treatise,
specifically
weiners’
harvard
law
review
article
in
1958.
now,
this
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
another
equally
authoritative
historical
treatise
in
the
harvard
law
review
the
preceding
year
by
henderson
on
the
identical
question
with
exactly
the
opposite
conclusion
from
that
reached
by
weiner.
but
the
ninth
circuit
shows
to
go
along
with
weiner.
despite
the
fact
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
every
other
court
before
whom
the
question
has
been
raised
with
both
those
articles
presented
to
the
courts
for
their
consideration
have
chosen
henderson
instead,
if
they
chose
any.
now,
with
regard
to
the
reliance
on
history
for
constitutional
interpretation,
where
the
documentation
is
inconclusive
and
disputable,
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
dissenting
with
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
just
last
term
on
june
30th,
stated
in
the
case
of
faretta
versus
california.
“like
mr.
justice
blackmun
i
hesitate
to
participate
in
the
court’s
attempt
to
use
history
to
take
it
where
legal
analysis
cannot,
piecing
together
shreds
of
english
legal
history
and
early
state
constitution
and
statutory
provisions
without
a
full
elaboration
of
the
context
in
which
they
occurred
or
any
other
evidence
that
they
relied
on,
by
the
drafters
of
our
federal
constitution
creates
more
questions
than
it
answers.
and
hardly
provides
the
firm
foundation
upon
which
the
creation
of
new
constitutional
rights
should
rest
and
more
pertinent.
we
are
well
reminded
that
this
court
once
employed
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
english
and
colonial
practices
regarding
the
right
to
counsel.
to
justify
the
conclusion
that
it
was
fundamental
to
a
fair
trial
and
less
than
ten
years
later
used
essentially
the
same
material
to
conclude
that
it
was
not.”
compare
powell
versus
alabama,
and
betts
v.
brady.
i
think
that
should
be
kept
in
mind
when
we
are
considering
whether
or
not
a
fundamental
question
like
this
should
be
decided
as
the
ninth
circuit
did
on
a
single
documentation
which
is
in
dispute.
now
aside
from
the
disputed
historical
documentation
on
the
question,
logic
demands
acceptance
of
the
view,
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
intent
to
accept
the
sixth
amendment
from
applicability
to
the
military
service
by
silence.
because
they
specifically
wrote
in
an
expressed
exception
in
the
fifth
amendment
with
regards
to
presentment
or
indictment
of
a
grand
jury.
that
is
the
position
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
has
considered
the
matter,
united
states
versus
jacoby
in
1960
and
united
states
versus
tempia
in
1967.
so
we
do
not
need
this
historical
documentation
which
is
in
dispute.
logic
explains
to
us
as
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
pointed
out
that
if
the
framers
intended
an
exception
they
would
have
done
what
they
did
with
the
fifth,
they
would
have
written
it
in.
now,
this
court
in
parker
versus
levy
in
1974
implicitly
affirms
the
impact
of
burns
versus
wilson
some
20
years
ago.
that
quoting
from
united
states
versus
tempia,
the
protections
of
the
constitution
are
available
to
servicemen
in
military
trials.
now,
this
court
in
parker
held,
as
the
court
of
military
appeals
had
previously
held
and
recognize
by
virtue
of
the
priest
case
that
was
involved
in
the
parker
case,
that
the
constitutional
guarantees
may
be
applied
differently
to
servicemen
where
military
necessity
requires
it.
in
other
words,
where
it
can
be
shown
and
the
burden
is
on
the
military
to
show
it,
that
it
requires
a
somewhat
different
application
as
applied
to
military
men
than
as
applied
to
civilians.
now
the
court
of
military
appeals
knew
that
full
well
as
they
indicated
by
their
holding
in
priest
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
the
first
amendment
rights
there
involved.
and
so,
it
is
nothing
new
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
that
there
is
such
a
doctrine
that
where
military
necessity
requires
it,
the
constitutional
guarantees
may
be
applied
somewhat
differently.
but
the
point
is
that
in
this
case
which
does
not
involve
the
first
amendment
but
involves
the
sixth
amendment
where
the
court
of
military
appeals
recognizing
this
concept
of
military
necessity
has
considered
the
issue,
has
decided
that
there
is
no
military
necessity
for
a
ruling
which
would
deny
to
men
in
service,
their
sixth
amendment
rights
of
assistance
to
counsel.
i
think
that
on
this
question
of
military
necessity
which
the
federal
parties
have
led
such
great
stress
upon
that
the
ninth
circuit
stated
it
most
succinctly
in
their
decision
in
daigle
versus
warner
which
is
crosby
versus
warner
petition
pending
in
this
court.
i
am
quoting
from
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
“while
the
navy
argues
with
some
vigor
that
naval
discipline
will
suffer
severely
if
appointed
counsel
are
required,
there
is
scant
support
if
this
in
the
record.
the
army
and
air
force
already
provide
counsel
to
all
accused
before
summary
courts-martial.
and
the
navy
allows
private
retained
counsel
to
participate
in
such
proceedings.
the
navy
suggest
that
the
effectiveness
of
a
summary
courts-martial
as
a
tool
for
preserving
discipline
and
order
will
be
undermined
by
the
participation
of
counsel.
if
so,
this
must
already
be
true
as
to
those
defendants
who
can
afford
retained
counsel.”
now
aside
from
the
argument
with
regard
to
military
necessity,
i
think
this
also
points
out
that
it
is
a
refutation
of
the
argument
also
made
that
affording
counsel
to
men
in
service
disrupts
some
congressional
scheme
which
specifically
according
to
the
federal
parties
is
designed
not
to
provide
counsel
to
men
in
service
at
summary
courts-martial.
now
the
fact
is
that
when
congress
adopted
the
military
practices
act
in
1968,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
argersinger
had
not
yet
been
rendered
which
was
in
1972.
so
it
is
fairly
clear
that
if
congress
had
known
that
this
court
considered
for
the
first
time,
mind
you,
that
petty
offenses
required
assistance
of
counsel,
they
might
have
considered
differently
when
passing
that
act
in
1968.
and
the
net
effect
as
it
stands
now
is
that
yes,
retained
counsel
by
those
servicemen
who
can
afford
retained
counsel
are
permitted
to
have
counsel
at
summary
courts-martial.
the
practical
result
is,
that
those
who
do
not
have
counsel
because
they
are
not
afforded
counsel
in
summary
courts-martial
are
the
poor,
the
indigent,
the
enlisted
man
of
the
lowest
ranks
who
cannot
afford
to
retain
counsel.
now
certainly
congress
did
not
intend
that
that
should
be
the
result.
that
is
not
the
congressional
scheme
of
congress
and
the
fact
that
a
counsel
may
be
retained
by
a
servicemen
in
a
summary
courts-martial
indicates
that
there
is
no
firm
scheme
on
the
part
of
congress
that
absolutely
under
no
circumstances
shall
there
be
appointed
counsel
at
summary
courts-martial.
excuse
me.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
he
may
have,
he
may
opt
out
and
he
may
have
instead
a
special
court
martial
or
a
general
court-martial.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
at
which
he
would
not
have
counsel,
which
congress
has
provided
for
specifically
in
those
courts-martials.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
oh.
it
does
not
save
the
system
at
all
for
the
reason
that
under
this
court’s
doctrine
of
united
states
versus
jackson,
it
is
a
limitation
on
his
use
of
the
constitutional
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
yes.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
i
have
given
matters
some
thought
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
yes,
but
because
the
two
situations
are
not
analogous
at
all
in
my
view,
for
the
reason
that
the
two
tier
court
system
provides
two
different
trials,
the
man
has
a
choice
after
having
one
trial
to
completely
negate
the
result
of
that
trial
and
choose
to
go
and
have
another
trial.
but
in
this
summary
courts-martial
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
but
in
summary
courts-martial
set-up—
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
he
may
go
have
it
but
he
will
stand
the
risk
of
much
greater
punishment
if
he
does.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
but
at
least
you
would
have
the
opportunity
of
being
found
not
guilty
in
the
second
trial.
you
are
having
the
choice
of
two
different
trials.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
you
have
only
one
opportunity
for
trial
of
any
sort
in
the
summary
courts-martial
system.
you
are
either
going
to
take
the
summary
court-martial
or
you
are
not
going
to
have
it
at
all
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
you
can
get
it
at
the
risk
of
greater
punishment
which
this
court
in
united
states
versus
jackson
says
“
is
an
unconstitutional
limitation
on
your
use
of
your
constitutional
rights.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
in
the
two-tier
example,
as
i
understand
it,
you
may
have
the
jury
trial
in
the
first
trial
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
well
i
would
not
be
too
sure
about
that
at
the
moment
but
i
believe
that
that
is
the
opportunity,
a
jury
trial
even
at
the
first
level,
in
the
first
court.
now
the
federal
parties
have
made
the
point
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
was
not
considering
this
question
of
military
necessity
when
they
decided
in
united
states
versus
alderman
with
the
favorable
view
with
regard
to
the
sixth
amendment
right.
now,
we
have
taken
the
opportunity
in
our
brief
to
quote
in
full
that
portion
of
the
brief
that
was
presented
in
the
alderman
case
before
the
court
of
military
appeals,
on
its
entire
question
of
military
necessity.
pages
15
to
28
of
our
brief
are
directly
quoted
from
the
brief
presented
to
the
court
of
military
appeals
in
alderman.
this
specifically
indicates
that
that
issue
of
military
necessity
was
very
forcefully
made
by
the
navy
before
the
court
of
military
appeals
fully
considered
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
in
their
opinion,
the
court
of
military
appeals
in
alderman
flatly
stated
that
there
is
no
showing
of
burden,
no
showing
of
military
necessity
made
out
to
indicate
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
should
be
deprived
to
men
in
service.
again
we
have
cited
at
length
and
quoted
at
length
in
our
brief
from
the
fidel
articles,
summary
courts-martial,
a
proposal
in
1971,
pages
29
and
30
of
our
second
brief
in
which,
although
the
entire
article
shows
that
there
is
no
military
necessity
for
summary
courts-martials
in
general,
the
specific
is
made
in
that
article
by
fidel
that
the
number
of
summary
courts-martials
dropped
from
64%
of
the
total
number
of
courts-martials
in
the
military
in
1962
to
25%
in
1969.
he
suggests
the
obvious
that
the
reason
for
the
drop
in
summary
courts-martials
in
those
years
which
were
pre-alderman
years,
pre-argersinger
years,
when
as
we
have
indicated
previously
since
june
8,
1973,
the
navy
along
with
the
army
and
the
air
force
has
been
providing
counsel
as
a
result
of
the
alderman
decision.
but
prior
to
that
time
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
he
would
be
given
at
a
very
early
stage
upon
being
charged
with
the
summary
courts-martial,
he
would
be
given
the
opportunity
to
opt
but
he
certainly
would
not
be
opting
for
a
general
court-martial,
if
he
was
going
to
opt
at
all.
now,
the
only
conceivable
reason
from
a
practical
stand
point
that
the
man
who
could
have
a
summary
courts-martial
without
counsel
would
choose
special
courts-martial
with
the
greater
risk
of
greater
punishment
would
be
that
he
feels,
if
he
is
sophisticated
enough
and
most
of
these
men
are
not,
that
if
he
has
a
lawyer,
he
probably
will
not
go
to
jail
at
all,
at
least
he
has
a
chance
of
not
going
to
jail
at
all.
and
what
he
is
trying
to
avoid
which
is
the
very
thing
that
argersinger
with
regard
to
civilians
was
all
about
was
not
to
be
forced
to
go
to
jail.
liberty,
not
to
be
forced
to
go
to
jail,
it
is
the
right
to
have
counsel
before
your
sentence
to
jail
to
have
the
defense
of
counsel
of
your
own
personal
counsel
which
is
the
whole
principle
of
argersinger.
and
it
should
certainly
apply
to
our
men
in
service
who
have
every
right
to
be
protected
by
the
constitution
even
more
so
perhaps
because
they
are
serving
their
country.
and
they
should
not
be
penalized
because
they
are
wearing
the
uniform
of
the
united
states.
so,
the
reason
given
by
fidel
which
is
the
obvious
one
for
the
tremendous
drop
in
summary
courts-martials
in
those
years
between
1962
and
69,
is
that
in
1962,
the
article
15
provisions
were
so
strengthened
by
congress
that
the
military
commanders
themselves
saw
that
it
was
much
more
practical
to
give
a
man
an
article
15
which
is
non-judicial
punishment
than
to
go
through
this
procedure
of
a
summary
courts-martial.
and
so
the
basic
reason
for
the
drop
in
summary
courts-martials
even
prior
to
the
alderman
decision
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
requirement
of
giving
counsel
was
the
article
15
practicality
that
commanders
saw.
and
there
was
this
complete
drop
in
summary
courts-martials
for
that
reason
which
is
certainly
strong
indication
of
a
lack
of
military
necessity
for
summary
courts-martials
in
the
first
place,
with
or
without
counsel.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
article
15,
in
the
navy
known
as
captain’s
mask,
you
may
be
given
punishment
of
restriction
to
limits,
correctional
custody,
not
confinement,
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
which
has
the
expertise
in
these
matters
over
some
many
years
of
considering
this
in
united
states
versus
schramel,
after
the
alderman
decision,
specifically
determined
the
question
that
the
argersinger
application
that
was
ruled
necessary
in
alderman
does
not
apply
to
article
15
punishment
because
it
is
non-judicial,
it
does
not
call
for
a
conviction
and
there
is
no
confinement.
the
man
does
not
go
to
jail
in
an
article
15.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
excuse
me
sir.
i
am
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
what
was
the
second
question?
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
do
you
mean
a
special
or
summary
sir?
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
the
basic
difference,
the
most
significant
difference
is
going
to
jail,
being
incarcerated,
confinement,
to
use
the
term
of
argersinger,
the
whole
point
of
argersinger
is
that
the
man
should
not
be
sent
to
jail
as
a
part
his
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
30
days.
thirty
days
confinement.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
the
captain’s
mask,
it
is
not
even
a
question
of
time.
you
are
not
confined,
you
are
restrictive
to
base
perhaps.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
if
he
thought
it
was
serious
enough
that
the
man
should
have
a
conviction
on
his
record
and
should
have
a
confinement
in
the
brig,
he
would
not
give
him
an
article
15.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
that
is
correct.
but
the
point
is
we
are
speaking
of
minor
offenses
and
the
types
of
offenses
for
which
punishment
is
needed
out.
under
both
article
15
and
summaries
are
of
the
same
general
type.
small
matters,
minor
matters
and
as
fidel
points
out
the
commanders
of
military
establishments
have
long
determined
that
for
these
minor
offenses
the
punishment
is
certainly
sufficient
under
article
15.
and
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
go
through
the
regular
role
and
the
formalities
that
exist
all
under
summary
courts-martial.
now
it
would
be
significant
to
this
court
to
be
aware.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
the
figures,
i
was
just
about
to
give
you
sir
as
obtained
at
special
request
from
the
judge
advocate
general’s
office,
department
of
the
navy,
august
21,
1975,
co-counsel
requested
the
information
from
that
source.
and
we
have
non-judicial
punishment
under
article
15
in
1965,
a
122,660
of
them
as
compared
to
summary
courts-martial
of
11,152.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
well,
i
could
not
give
you
specific
answer
to
that
but
i
think
the
significance—
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
perhaps
i
ought
to
point
out,
your
honor.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
yes.
our
position
is
not
that
summary
courts-martial
should
be
abolished.
that
is
not
our
position.
we
are
not
trying
to
destroy
the
institution
of
summary
courts-martial.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
the
necessity
for
it
is
certainly
not
that
great.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
i
would
grant
you
that
point,
i
would
emphasize
the
tremendous
discrepancy
in
the
number
between
the
article
15’s
and
the
summary’s.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
it
is
not
our
desire
before
this
court
to
seek
the
abolition
of
the
summary
courts-martial.
the
issue
of
this
case
and
all
that
we
are
contending
for
is,
that
if
you
are
going
to
have
summary
courts-martial
the
accused
should
have
his
personal
defense
council
as
required
under
argersinger
and
there
is
no
reason
not
to
apply
it
to
the
military.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
for
the
special
courts-martial
confinement
which
is
what
we
are
interested
in
specifically
here
is
six
months.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
it
would
be
for
same
offense.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
absolutely
not.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
there
are
many
instances
throughout
the
uniform
court
of
military
justice
which
do
not
require
a
counsel,
where
counsel
is
required
to
be
an
attorney.
now,
judge
pence
in
the
daigle
case
pointed
out
that
on
this
question
of
military
necessity
that
there
is
no
tremendous
burden
on
the
military
to
provide
counsel
because
no
one
is
saying
that
the
counsel
must
be
a
lawyer.
and
we
do
not
say
that
he
has
to
be
a
lawyer,
that
is
not
our
contention.
and
so,
certainly
as
judge
pence
pointed
out
in
the
daigle
opinion,
it
should
be
the
best
qualified
person
available
at
the
military
institution.
good
logic
demands
that.
but—
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
well,
in
my
brief.
i
do
not
know
if
i
could
find
quickly
enough
but
it
is
in
the
brief.
the
coast
guard
has
an
entire
established
guideline
for
determining
who
is
best
equipped
to
serve
his
counsel.
starting
out
with
people
who
are
present,
who
happen
to
be
lawyers.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
i
would
say
that,
yes.
someone
who
is
qualified
to
help,
who
is
best
qualified
to
help
which
does
not
mean
that
he
has
to
be
a
lawyer,
he
has
to
have
a
certain
degree
of
intelligence
and
good
common
sense
and
the
willingness
to
serve
a
person
who
is
accused
of
a
crime
and
so
forth.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
in
the
summary
court-martial?
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
a
single
commissioned
officer
who
need
not
to
be
lawyer
and
generally
is
not.
so
we
are
not
saying
that
the
lawyer
that
needs
to
be
appointed
to
defend
the
accused,
i
mean
that
the
counsel
should
be
a
lawyer
either.
we
are
not
making
that
point
at
all.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
even
if
he
were
poorly
qualified,
the
greatest
attribute
that
he
has
for
defending
that
accused
person
is
his
undivided
loyalty
in
an
attempt
to
the
best
of
his
ability
to
defend
him.
now
that
is
exactly
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
not
a
hand
holding
operation.
he
has
had
at
least
the
operation
to
the
extent
of
his
ability
to
interview
witnesses
which
the
accused
certainly
cannot
call
upon
the
one
court-martial
officer
who
is
wearing
the
three
hats
of
the
judge,
the
prosecutor,
and
the
so-called
the
defense
counsel
because
that
officer
as
full
of
integrity
as
he
may
be,
as
fully
desirous
as
he
may
be
of
doing
his
duty
as
article
20
calls
for,
simply
cannot
perform
the
function
of
serving
both
the
prosecution
and
the
defense.
you
cannot
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
because
in
many
instances,
it
requires
his
interviewing
such
witnesses
as
his
commanding
officer,
colonels
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
well,
he
is
not
the
accused,
he
may
be
at
the
disadvantage
and
that
is
the
reason
why
judge
pence
in
daigle
said,
he
should
be
the
best
qualified
person
available,
not
just—
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
if
he
were
stupid
enough
to
make
that
request
rather
than
making
--
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
well,
i
would
say
that
i
do
not
believe
that
is
an
issue
that
we
are
trying
to
bring
before
the
court
by
now,
but
i
would
say
if
that
is
what
the
man
wants,
this
court
just
decided
last
term
that
if
the
man
absolutely
wants
no
counsel,
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
say
“i
have
no
counsel.”
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
i
would
say
so,
yes.
i
would
say
he
might
be
stupid
to
want
the
poorest
possible
defense
counsel
but
he
can
find
when
there
is
much
better
qualified
to
represent
him.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
in
that
sense
he
has
made
a
waiver
but
certainly
he
has
been
given
his
constitutional
right
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
write
to
counsel
and
we
would
be
certainly
satisfied
with
that.
but
i
do
not
think
that
these
hypotheticals
would
be
the
general
rule.
a
man
given
the
opportunity
to
have
counsel
at
summary
courts-martial
is
going
to
request
the
best
possible
counsel
that
he
can
be
provided
with.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
no
specific
standard
or
guideline
need
be
announced
by
this
court.
the
manner
in
which
judge
pence
determined
in
the
daigle
case
was
to
say
that
under
argersinger
the
person
who
was
available
under
the
circumstances
to
beat
counsel
would
be
sufficient
depending
on
the
circumstances.
out
at
sea,
an
outpost
or
whatever,
who
may
be
best
qualified
will
differ
with
the
circumstances.
the
general
concept
that
the
best
qualified
counsel
should
be
made
available
is
the
one
we
are
speaking
to.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
no,
i
am
not
asking
you
to
say
it—
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
not
necessarily
to
get
into
that
question.
no.
mr.
nathan
r.
zahm
thank
your
honor.
