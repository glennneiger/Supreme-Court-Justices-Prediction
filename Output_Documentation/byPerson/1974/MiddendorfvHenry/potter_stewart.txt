he
can
go
to
the
brig
from
a
captain's
mast,
at
least
that
used
to
be
correct.

that
was
the
old
navy,
at
least
for
me.
it
was
the
old
navy.
justice

on
a
ship
and
on
a
ship
at
sea,
doesn't
that
include
the
power
of
the
commanding
officer
to
have
the
man
locked
up
in
the
brig
on
reduced
tractions
still?
justice

stewart
mr.
zahm,
having
interrupted
you
at
once,
let
me
ask
you
another
question
that's
a
little
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
confusing
to
me.
is
what
we're
talking
about
here
what
used
to
be
called
a
deck
court?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
navy
at
least,
a
deck
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
summary
court,
back
in
the
world
war
ii,
was
quite
a
different
thing,
that
was
a
three-officer
court
in
which
you
did
have
a
right
to
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
navy,
not
the
army.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
were
--
yes,
world
war
ii.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
used
to
be
called
a
deck
court.
justice
potter
stewart
but
a
summary
court
used
to
be
a
three-member
court.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
originally
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
end
up
to
30
years
ago,
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
summary
court
in
those
days,
you
had
a
right
to
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
the
deck
courts
you
didn't
and
you
didn't
count
the
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
the
columnist
wanted
nomenclature
if
he
were
to
call
an
investigator
or
something
like
that,
maybe.
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
--
well,
in
a
quasi-investigative
capacity,
it's
a
quasi-inquisitorial
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
proceeding,
is
it
not?
i
used
to
serve
as
a
deck
court
officer
and
that's
the
reason
i
asked
you.
justice
potter
stewart
the
alderman
decision
made
perspective
in
its
application
only?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
prior
--
justice
potter
stewart
but,
in
the
last
portion
of
your
brief,
you
ask
us
that
even
if
we
should
decide
against
you
on
the
underlying
merits
that
we
not
make
any
decision
retroactive
and
i
would
--
that's
what
prompted
my
question
as
to
whether
the
alderman
decision
itself
is
retroactive.
justice
potter
stewart
from
then
on.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
arrested
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
go
to
jail,
for
a
while
at
least
until
there's
a
bail
hearing
or
probable
cause
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
one
example
would
be
--
if
your
footnote
is
correct
on
page
12
of
your
brief
that,
well
you
call
it
now
an
article
15
administrative
proceeding
which
we
used
to
call
captain's
mast
where
a
ship
at
sea
can
put
on
a
man
in
jail
for
three
days
on
bread
and
water.
justice
potter
stewart
that
could
--
a
review
if
that,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it's
a
summary
court
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
special
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
any
of
those
could
be
on
shipboard.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
beyond
that,
for
a
general
court,
it
has
to
be
somewhere
else,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
not
at
sea?
you
say
that
can
be
done
on
shore
and
implying
that
it
cannot
be
done
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
a
ship
at
sea?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
non-adversary
proceeding.
