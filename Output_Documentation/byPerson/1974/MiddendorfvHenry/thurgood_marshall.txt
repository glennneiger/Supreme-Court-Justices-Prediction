justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you're
--
you're
not
complaining
about
the
investigation,
you're
complaining
about
if
he
ends
up
putting
a
man
in
the
brig,
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
you're
complaining.
justice
thurgood
marshall
regardless
of
what
the
other
two
think.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
frey,
do
you
of
any
other
situation
where
a
man
is
put
in
jail
without
a
judicial
proceeding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
i'm
right.
you
don't
go
to
jail
except
as
a
result
of
a
judicial
proceeding.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
frey,
i
have
one
more
point
to
my
question.
do
you
know
of
any
instance
where
a
man
is
put
in
jail
in
a
non-judicial
proceeding
of
which
there
has
no
review
any
place
under
any
circumstances?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
reviewed
by
a
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right,
it's
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
know
any
place
else
in
the
navy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
all
it
would
say
that
you
could
hold
it
with
counsel.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
does
it
say
specifically
that
it
can't
have
counsel?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
30
days,
you
get
something
other
than
bread
and
water
if
he's
a
civilian.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
still
that
--
do
you
still
remember
that
the
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
think
congress
can
say
we
can
set
up
some
other
kind
of
proceeding
to
put
a
man
in
jail.
that
is
not
judicial.
i
don't
think
congress
can
do
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
submit
that
the
determining
factor
is
whether
he
goes
to
jail.
that's
the
one
factor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
can
put
a
man
in
jail
without
an
adversary
proceeding.
justice
thurgood
marshall
even
if
it
results
in
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
great
trouble
with
the
statistics,
you
just
take
that
one
year
and
how
long
has
it
been
going
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
picked
out
the
last
year,
did
you
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
the
years
before?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
how
many
that
were
here
before.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
have
--
these
courts
were
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
years
are
you
using
as
your
normal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
submit
that
i
have
never
heard
of
anything
like
it
before
in
my
life.
if
you
want
to
show
a
norm,
you
take
a
series
of
years,
do
not
just
take
that
last
year.
i
mean
maybe
the
year
before,
nobody
had
went
to
the
past.
nobody
has
a
special
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
what
you
just
told
us
is
in
the
court
martial
manual,
said
he
cannot
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
he
could
under
the
court-martial
manual.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
really
want
us
to
overrule
court
of
appeals?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)doing
it,
have
you?
you
could
just
as
easy
follow
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
have
you
lost
any
wars
as
a
result
of
it,
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
article
15
there
is
only
one
officer,
is
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
only
one
officer.
and
in
the
special
court,
it
is
one
officer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
the
captain’s
mask
you
cannot
give
any
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
a
captain’s
mask
understand
you
cannot
put
him
in
the
brig,
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
but
you
can
not
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
cannot
give
him
six
months.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
i
mean
the
summary
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
given
us
all
other
statistics.
how
much
time
does
the
second
tier
to
take?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
usually
if
you
have
given
this
all
other
to
the—
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
i
mean
the
hearing
itself.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
not
it
about
the
saying
of
the
captain's
mask?
