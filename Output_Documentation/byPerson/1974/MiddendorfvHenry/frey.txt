mr.
frey
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
frey
they
are,
yes,
unless
congress
changes
the
legislative
structure.
mr.
frey
i
don't
believe
that
it's
in
the
brief,
but
we
would
not
have
petition
for
certiorari
had
he
not
requested
a
--
i
mean,
we
petitioned
for
certiorari
on
behalf
of
the
secretary
because
the
secretary
was
very
anxious
to
have
this
matter
clarified
and
to
be
able
to
enforce
the
congressional
scheme
for
courts-martial
which
he
was
unable
to
do
as
the
result
of
the
alderman
decision.
mr.
frey
well,
that's
a
very
strange
thing.
retroactivity
was
not
argued
in
alderman
as
far
as
i
know
but,
in
fact,
there
was
a
retroactive
decision
because
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
no
jurisdiction
over
summary
courts-martial.
they
are
not
reviewed
into
the
court
system.
it
has
no
particular
expertise
with
respect
to
that
special
facet
of
the
system,
and
the
issue
there
was
that
enhanced
punishment
had
been
imposed
on
mr.
alderman
at
a
subsequent
special
court.
mr.
frey
because
of
the
prior
summary
conviction.
so,
in
effect,
they
gave
it.
they
gave
argersinger
retroactive
effect
and
we,
of
course,
take
the
position
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
reading
their
opinion
in
alderman
that
they
did
not
deal
with
this
as
military
experts.
they've
dealt
with
this
by
reading
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
supreme
court
in
argersinger
and
concluding
quite
summarily
in
the
case
of
judge
quinn's
opinion
and
almost
equally
summarily
in
the
case
of
judge
duncan's
that
this
was
binding
on
the
court
of
military
appeals.
in
fact,
judge
duncan
said,
as
far
as
he
was
concerned,
this
was
a
perfectly
fair
and
reasonable
procedure
and
if
he
were
not
under
the
force
of
argersinger
he
would
uphold
it.
mr.
frey
we
are
--
our
interest
with
respect
to
retroactivity
is
as
of
the
date
of
alderman,
in
other
words,
our
position
would
be
that
alderman,
if
it
was
correct
in
declaring
that
there
was
a
right
to
counsel
in
summary
courts-martial,
would
be
the
break
with
the
past
for
retroactivity
purposes
if
the
secretary
complied
with
alderman
under
the
force
of
that
decision.
mr.
frey
but
there
are
--
we
think
that,
under
the
morrissey
approach,
that
the
proper
standard
for
retroactivity,
and
i
didn't
mean
to
get
into
this
at
length
because
i
trust
you'll
never
have
to
reach
it
but,
that
the
proper
standard
would
be
from
the
date
the
rule
was
changed.
if
that's
not
to
be
the
standard,
there
are
--
there's
a
mare's
nest
of
possible
retroactive
problems
of
various
consequences
and
various
future
and
past
consequences
and
we
would
suggest
that
you
not
get
into
the
details
of
what
parts
would
be
retroactive
and
what
parts
not.
mr.
frey
well,
i
think
there
is
because
i
think
it's
clear
from
morrissey
and
from
wolf
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
held
to
contribute
to
the
fairness
of
the
proceeding
substantially.
after
all,
in
morrissey,
there
was
a
liberty
interest
at
steak
and
the
chief
justice
began
by
recognizing
that
there
was
a
substantial
liberty
interest
that
was
being
affected
by
this
action
and,
therefore,
looking
into
the
due
process
requirement
surrounding
that
and
the
court,
nevertheless,
recognized
that
it
held
that
prospective
in
morrissey
and
it
subsequently
recognized
in
wolf
that
it
--
that
those
kinds
of
rulings
maybe
prospective.
i
think
it's
a
judgment
and
i
think,
in
part,
the
judgment
would
turn
on
this
court's
belief
as
to
how
defective
these
proceedings
without
counsel
have
been.
and,
i
think
as
i
get
into
my
argument,
i
hope
i'll
persuade
you,
if
our
brief
hasn't
already,
that
these
are
quite
fair
proceedings
and
that
the
system
that
congress
has
devised
is
an
admirable
one.
mr.
frey
of
course
there
are
differences.
mr.
frey
i
agree.
i
think
our
opponents
in
this
case
are
interested
in
analyzing
the
case
by
label.
they
want
to
attach
the
label
that
says
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding,
and
we
don't
deny
that
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding.
and
then,
they
want
to
take
the
label
“imprisonment”
and
then
they
want
to
ask
the
court
to
stop
thinking
about
the
case
any
further
and
proceed
automatically.
now,
i
suggest
that
it's
necessary
to
make
a
pragmatic
and
a
functional
analysis
and
to
look
at
what's
happening
here
and
i
--
as
i
say,
i
think
the
substantial
problem
about
which
we're
concerned
is
the
validity
of
these
procedures
in
the
first
place,
and
the
retroactivity
problem
is
a
quite
secondary
one.
now,
a
little
over
20
years
ago
in
burns
against
wilson,
this
court
considered
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
protections
applicable
to
the
military
justice
system
and,
thus,
the
scope
of
its
powers
to
oversee
the
operation
of
that
system
in
these
terms.
it
said
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
due
process
is
meaningful
and
often
sufficiently
adaptable
to
protect
soldiers,
as
well
as
civilians,
from
the
crude
injustices
of
a
trial
so
conducted
that
it
becomes
bent
on
fixing
guilt
by
dispensing
with
rudimentary
fairness
rather
than
finding
truth
through
adherence
to
those
basic
guarantees
which
have
long
been
recognized
and
honored
by
military
courts,
as
well
as
the
civilian
courts.
those
words
are
in
some
ways
reminiscent
of
justice
cardozo's
formulation
of
the
power
of
this
court
over
state
courts
in
palko
against
connecticut.
of
course,
much
has
changed
in
our
constitutional
jurisprudence
since
those
words
were
penned,
but
this
court
has
never
stepped
beyond
the
bounds
of
its
self-imposed
restraints
in
order
to
strike
down
as
unconstitutional
any
provision
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
or
to
invalidate
any
procedure
deliberately
chosen
by
congress
for
the
administration
of
military
justice.
if
the
court
rules
against
the
navy
in
this
proceeding
and
declares
invalid
the
congressional
decision
to
utilize
the
relatively
informal
non-adversarial
procedures
of
the
summary
courts-martial
for
the
disposition
of
relatively
minor
charges,
it
will
have
taken
a
historic
step.
it
will
have
broken
sharply
with
the
past
and
it
will,
i
suggest,
have
intruded
unjustifiably
on
the
responsibilities
of
the
congress.
mr.
frey
well,
we
have
a
judicial
proceeding
here.
i'm
--
we
don't
need
to
suggest
it.
in
non-judicial
punishment,
he
may
be
put
in
the
brig.
mr.
frey
well,
--
mr.
frey
that's
true,
but
this
is
a
somewhat
different
matter
because
this
is
an
adjudication
of
finding
that
an
offense
had
been
committed
and
the
imposition
of
punishment
consequent
upon
that
finding.
mr.
frey
well,
you
would
go
jail
there
without
a
judicial
proceeding,
but
with
a
--
mr.
frey
you
could.
mr.
frey
yes,
but
we
don't
--
we
are
not
advocating
here
the
ninth
circuit
formulation
in
daigle
because
we
don't
think
it's
workable
for
summary
courts-martial,
and
we
think
that
the
procedure,
overall,
is
sufficiently
fair
that
there
is
no
question
of
--
there
should
be
no
question
of
requiring
counsel.
mr.
frey
well,
that's
true
and,
of
course,
in
wolff
where
the
duration
of
your
imprisonment
was
at
stake,
you're
not
normally
entitled
to
counsel.
mr.
frey
well,
let
me
put
it
--
mr.
frey
that's
right.
it
relied
on
cases
which
required
a
case
by
case
evaluation.
we
feel
that
it
is
not
feasible
under
these
circumstances
to
conduct
that
kind
of
case
by
case
evaluation.
mr.
frey
well,
we'd
rather
not
be
--
mr.
frey
congress
wished
to
have
none
and
we
would
like
to
abide
by
the
scheme
that
congress
has
established
until
congress
changes
it
if
we
can.
if
we
can't,
we
don't
feel
it's
workable
to
--
mr.
frey
yes,
it
could.
mr.
frey
it
could
do
that.
mr.
frey
i
think
that's
the
way
the
navy
would
react
to
that.
it
would
--
mr.
frey
well,
it's
possible.
i
can't
--
this
is
what
the
navy
tells
me
they
feel
is
the
viable,
and
this
is
what
they've
been
doing,
although
they've
been
doing
it
under
an
argersinger-based
rationale
from
the
court
of
military
appeals.
now,
much
of
the
argument
in
my
opponent's
brief
has
been
directed
to
the
proposition
that
summary
courts-martial,
as
presently
constituted,
are
not
really
such
a
good
idea
as
relied
on
the
views
expressed
by
senator
irvin
and
in
dissent
to
the
1968
decision
to
continue
--
mr.
frey
yes.
mr.
frey
no,
alderman
does
not
require
the
provision
of
lawyer-counsel
at
sea
and
--
nor
is
it
necessary
and
even
in
the
case
of
a
special
court
and
special
courts
are
also
conducted
at
sea,
although
not
with
the
same
frequency
as
summary
courts.
mr.
frey
well,
i
don't
--
i
think
that
the
army
acquiesce,
and
i
think
they
may
be
now
reluctant
about
it
but,
they
did
acquiesce
in
the
view.
they
read
argersinger
as
being
applicable.
now,
the
degree
of
sophistication
of
their
analysis
at
the
time
they
issued
that,
i
can't
speak
to.
mr.
frey
the
air
force
made
very
little
use
of
summary
courts
and
i
think
the
character,
the
nature
of
the
personnel
in
the
air
force
are
somewhat
different
in
terms
of
levels
of
education
and
so
on
that
it
affects
the
utility
or
the
need
for
the
summary
court
as
a
device
for
maintaining
discipline.
mr.
frey
they
recognized
that
there
could
be
an
exception
because
lawyer-counsel
as
--
what
happens
in
summary
courts
that
are
still
conducted
at
sea
is,
sometimes,
there
are
many
aircraft
carrier
which
is
practically
a
travelling
city
in
which
may
have
two
attorneys
on
it.
in
which
case,
lawyer-counsel
will
be
provided
but,
if
not,
they
provide
an
officer
to
service
counsel
who's
not
a
lawyer.
and
by
the
way,
no
one
is
prevented
from
having,
as
far
as
i
know,
counsel
of
his
choice,
that
is
from
having
a
friend,
his
warrant
officer,
come
and
help
him
at
a
summary
court
proceeding.
even
now,
he
is
not
required
to
go
into
the
proceeding
alone.
now,
there's
been
a
suggestion
that
you
wouldn't
be
declaring
a
statute
unconstitutional
if
you
ruled
against
the
navy's
position
in
this
case
and,
while
in
some
technical
sense
it's
true
that
congress
hasn't
prohibited
the
use
of
counsel
at
summary
courts,
i
think
that
this
court
should
make
no
mistake
about
concluding
that
a
declaration
of
invalidity
of
the
summary
court
procedure
would
represent
an
exercise
of
the
court's
constitutional
veto
over
the
powers
of
congress.
mr.
frey
well,
you
would
say
that
the
constitution
did
not
permit
it
to
be
held
the
way
the
congress
planned
for
it
to
be
held
and
it's
quite
clear
if
you
look
at
article
27
of
the
--
mr.
frey
no,
i
was
just
saying
that
it
can't
have
counsel,
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress,
which
is
supposed
to
provide
for
the
administration
of
military
justice,
deliberately
selected
a
system
in
which
summary
courts
would
not
entail
a
provision
of
counsel
and
if
you
look
at
article
27
which
deals
with
the
provision
of
counsel
in
special
and
general
courts,
it's
clear
that
this
was
a
carefully
thought
out
deliberate
decision
of
congress.
now,
the
framework
of
analysis
for
a
case
of
this
sort,
we
suggest,
is
found
in
the
court's
recent
decision
in
parker
against
levy.
now,
the
court
there
recognized
the
important
differences
between
the
military
and
the
civilian
community
and
the
differences
in
their
criminal
justice
systems
that
flowed
from
that.
these
differences
derive
in
a
large
part
from
the
special
relationship
of
the
government
to
its
servicemen
and
the
vastly
greater
proportion
of
the
serviceman's
life
that
is
subject
to
regulation.
and,
in
light
of
this,
the
court
held
in
parker
against
levy,
“for
the
reasons
which
differentiate
military
society
from
civilian
society,”
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
21
of
the
slip
opinion.
“we
think
congress
is
permitted
to
legislate
both
with
greater
breath
and
with
greater
flexibility
when
prescribing
the
rules
by
which
the
former,
that
is
the
military
society,
shall
be
governed
than
when
it--
than
it
is
when
prescribing
the
rules
for
the
latter.”
it
then
went
on
to
say
at
page
23,
“the
fundamental
necessity
for
obedience
and
the
consequent
necessity
for
the
imposition
of
discipline
may
render
permissible
within
the
military
that
which
would
be
constitutionally
impermissible
outside
it.”
against
this
background,
i
would
like
the
court
now
to
consider
the
role
that
the
summary
courts-martial
plays
in
the
system
that
congress
has
established
for
the
administration
of
military
justice.
system
is
a
flexible
one.
as
you've
read,
i'm
sure
there
are
four
levels
which
it
designed
to
deal
with
the
broad
range
of
offenses.
the
most
minor
disciplinarian
fractions
are
dealt
with
the
most
informally
in
a
proceeding
that
is
quite
limited
and
the
punishments
that
could
be
imposed.
the
most
grave
are
dealt
with
in
proceedings
of
considerable
formality
with
substantial
procedural
protections
and
potent
penalties
available,
that
is,
the
general
court-martial.
now,
this
court
recognized
in
parker
against
levy
that
the
article
15
proceeding
which
imposes
punishments
which,
in
most
respects,
are
similar
to
the
punishments
at
summary
court
but
which
does
not
include
confinement
of
hard
labor,
that
that
part
took
in
many
ways
of
the
aspects
of
a
labor
relations
matter
between
an
employer
and
an
employee.
well
here,
while
it's
true
that
we
have
a
criminal
proceeding,
it's
also
true
that
the
summary
court,
the
next
step
up
in
the
scale,
partakes
very
much
of
the
same
factors.
its'
frequently
used
for
the
--
it
can
be
used
for
the
same
kinds
of
offenses
for
which
non-judicial
punishment
under
article
15
could
be
employed
or
for
which
a
special
court
could
be
convened.
part
of
the
judgment
that
would
go
into
the
decision
to
invoke
a
summary
court
would
be,
for
instance,
that
this
particular
individual
had
committed
the
same
offenses
several
times,
he'd
been
punished
under
article
15,
he
was
not
responding
to
discipline,
and
it
was
necessary
to
step
up
a
little
the
degree
of
punishment
that
could
be
imposed
on
him
in
an
effort
to
generate
obedience
and
discipline
on
this
point.
mr.
frey
the
commanding
officer.
mr.
frey
or
the
--
mr.
frey
convene
a
summary
court
--
mr.
frey
--
or
a
special
court.
mr.
frey
but
the
--
mr.
frey
yes.
mr.
frey
yes.
mr.
frey
i
think
that's
right.
now,
on
shore,
the
sailor
could
reject
either
an
article
15
and
he
could
reject
the
summary
court.
he
could
insist
on
the
more
formal
judicial
proceeding,
the
next
step
up
the
scale.
mr.
frey
at
sea,
they
can
reject
summary
court
but
they
cannot
reject
article
15
punishment.
that's
a
special
exception
that
has
been
drawn,
i
think,
for
reasons
that
are
traditional
with
the
navy
in
terms
of
the
authority
of
the
captain
which
is
either
greater
than
the
authority
of
the
other
commanding
officers
in
the
service
in
other
circumstances.
mr.
frey
at
a
ship
at
sea,
yes.
now,
the
summary
courts-martials
are
mostly
for
military
types
of
offenses.
still,
these
are
the
vast
bulk.
i
think
it
was
86%,
according
to
the
table
we
have
in
our
brief,
are
offenses
that
would
not
be
offenses
in
civilian
life
at
all.
majority
of
them
are
unauthorized
absence,
also,
disobeying
an
order,
disrespect
to
a
superior
officer,
and
so
on.
there
are
substantial
procedural
differences,
some
we've
shown
in
our
brief
that
the
summary
courts-martial
takes
about,
before
alderman,
took
about
33
days.
special
courts
take
somewhere
in
the
order
of
two
to
three
times
as
long
from
charge
to
disposition,
it
seem
to
me,
clear
reasons
why
the
navy
would
prefer
not
to
use
a
special
court
if
it
didn't
feel
that
such
severe
punishments
were
necessary
to
deal
with
a
particular
offense.
now,
if
this
court's
decision
substantially
alters
and
impairs
the
utility
and
the
flexibility
of
the
summary
courts-martial,
then
the
carefully
balanced
structure,
graduated
procedures,
and
penalties
established
by
congress
will
be
itself
impaired
and
its
character
substantially
altered.
these
consequences
may,
of
course,
be
constitutionally
compelled,
and
they
would
be
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
use
of
non-adversarial
procedures
comes
anywhere
close,
parking
back
to
the
burns
and
wilson
language,
to
“the
crude
injustices
of
a
trial
so
conducted
that
it
becomes
bent
on
fixing
guilt
by
dispensing
with
rudimentary
fairness.”
we
don't
think
these
words
are
even
remotely
applicable
to
the
summary
court
procedure.
in
answering
the
constitutional
inquiry
that
you
have
before
you,
there
are
three
factors
to
be
considered:
first,
the
fairness
of
the
procedures
as
a
means
of
adjudicating
guilt
and
imposing
punishment
for
relatively
minor
infractions.
second,
a
consideration
of
what
is
at
stake
for
the
individual
in
the
proceeding.
in
other
words,
what's
the
potential
impact
of
a
mistake
on
his
life?
thirdly,
what
are
the
governmental
interests
that
are
served
by
the
procedure?
and,
i'd
like
to
consider
that
last
factor
first.
the
principal
consideration
that
i
think
is
important
to
the
services
in
the
use
of
a
summary
courts-martial
is
speed
of
disposition.
they
want
to
get
the
man
back
on
the
job
swiftly
to
maximize
the
deterrent
or
corrective
effect
of
the
punishment,
and
i
think
it's
well-recognized
that
a
small
punishment
swiftly
imposed
is
frequently
much
more
effective
as
a
means
of
correcting
behavior
than
a
larger
punishment
substantially
delayed.
now,
if
you
would
look
at
the
table
at
page
26
of
our
brief,
you
will
see
that
what
has
happened
since
the
first
period,
that
is
january
1
through
june
30
of
1973,
was
largely
pre-alderman,
counsels
were
generally
not
provided
from
--
during
most
of
that
period.
the
two
subsequent
periods
were
post-alderman,
counsel
was
provided,
and
the
time
of
disposition
increased
from
33.5
days
approximately
to,
we
have
now
a
corrected
figure
on
the
basis
of
final
figures
that
were
not
available
at
the
time
we
did
the
brief,
43.62
days
for
the
first
half
of
calendar
1974.
now,
in
their
brief,
my
opponents
have
suggested
that
the
increase
in
acquittal
rates
is
the
product
of
the
provision
of
counsel
and
that
this
increases
as
much
as
32%
more
acquittals.
i'm
willing,
for
purposes
of
driving
home
a
point
which
i
think
is
very
important
for
this
court
to
consider,
to
accept
the
proposition,
although
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
scientifically
valid,
that
the
increase
in
acquittals
is
due
to
the
presence
of
counsel.
now,
if
you
will
compute
the
effect
of
that,
that
is,
if
you
will
assume
that
the
4.9%
acquittal
rate
during
the
pre-alderman
period
is
the
rate
of
acquittals
that
would've
occurred
without
counsel,
you
will
find
that
out
of
about
8,800
cases
there
would've
been
approximately
80
people
who
were
acquitted
with
counsel
who
would
not
have
been
acquitted
without
counsel,
about
80
people
out
of
8,800
cases.
now
in
exchange,
however,
if
you
will
attribute
the
increased
time,
and
i'm
not
saying
that
this
is
precisely
correct
but
i
think
of
the
major
component
in
the
increased
time
that
it
takes
to
try
these
cases
as
the
presence
of
counsel,
you
will
find
that
there
are
approximately
80,000
mandates
of
additional
time
of
people
having
charges
hanging
over
their
heads
indisposed
as
a
result
of
counsel.
so,
in
other
words,
and
i
don't
mean
to
minimize
the
importance
for
the
80
people
who
would've
been
convicted
had
they
had
not
lawyers,
the
significance
to
the
navy
and
to
these
people
is
80,000
mandates
of
people
with
charges
hanging
over
their
heads,
people
who
can't
be
assigned
on
mission,
and
some
of
these
people
innocent
with
charges
hanging
over
their
heads.
now,
turning
to
the
considerations
of
fairness,
we
think
there
are
significant
differences
in
terms
of
the
fairness
of
the
procedure
as
compared
to
the
civilian
procedures
that
this
court
was
considering
in
argersinger.
i
think
one
was
brought
out
in
the
questioning
of
mr.
zahm
and
it's
a
central
one.
this
is
not
an
adversarial
procedure.
the
misdemeanor
and
petty
offense
trials
at
stake
in
argersinger
were
adversarial
procedures.
they
didn't
always
involve
judges.
sometimes
in
police
courts,
police
officers
presented
the
case
but,
even
there,
was
somebody
who
was
experienced
in
court
who
knew
what
he
was
doing.
the
inquisitorial
system
of
justice
is
not
so
fundamentally
unfair,
as
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
that
it
can't
be
used
for
substantial
aspects
of
the
criminal
justice
system
in
many
european
countries.
also,
the
criminal
justice
system
in
the
military
is
not
burdened
with
the
kinds
of
backlogs
that
cause
the
court
concern
in
argersinger.
the
rush
to
judgment
that
was
awarded
in
argersinger,
we
believe,
is
clearly
not
a
concern
in
this
area.
and,
even
in
terms
of
impact
on
the
individual,
while
i
don't
wish
to
minimize
it,
it
is
simply
not
as
great
as
it
is
in
civilian
life,
for
instance,
employment
consequences,
immediate
employment
consequences.
a
man
in
the
navy
who's
convicted
at
a
summary
courts-martial
and
goes
to
the
brig
for
3
weeks
or
30
days,
he
has
a
job
when
he
gets
out.
he
can
still
get
an
honorable
discharge
from
the
navy
if
the
rest
of
his
record
is
good.
on
the
other
hand,
a
man
who
gets
30
days
in
jail
as
a
civilian
may
very
well
not
have
a
job
waiting.
the
fact
that
imprisonment
has
a
far
more
severe
consequence
--
mr.
frey
and
also
if
he's
a
sailor.
the
bread
and
water
is
a
limited
exception
that
applies
to
non-judicial
punishment
on
board
ship
for
up
to
three
days.
i
don't
know
whether
reduced
rations
is
a
penalty
that
can
be
imposed
under
summary
court.
do
you
know?
mr.
frey
the
same
amount
of
reduced
rations
as
for
non-judicial
punishment.
bread
and
water
for
a
limited
period
of
time
can
be
imposed
for
both
non-judicial
punishment
and
court-martial.
mr.
frey
yes.
yes,
the
summary
court
is
a
judicial
proceeding.
that
is
a
distinction
that
the
navy
makes,
but
we
believe
and
we
urge
this
court
to
recognize
that
congress
can
say
to
itself
“we're
going
to
have
a
judicial
proceeding
that
won't
exactly
resemble
the
judicial
proceedings
in
the
civilian
system.”
mr.
frey
well,
but
congress
has
not
--
to
say
that
it's
judicial
is
not
to
answer
the
question
as
to
what
specific
procedures
are
required.
mr.
frey
well
--
mr.
frey
well,
it
certainly
is,
it's
a
determination
of
facts
as
to
whether
or
not
he
did
--
mr.
frey
it's
a
non-adversarial
proceeding.
that's
an
important
--
mr.
frey
well,
that's
true
and
that's
done
in
europe.
it's
not
considered
fundamentally
unfair
--
no,
but
you're
dealing
--
but
you
are
dealing
here
with
the
military
and
this
court,
unless
it's
going
to
depart
from
a
long
tradition
that
it
has
never
departed
from
in
this
area,
gives
deference
to
the
military.
gives
room
for
special
procedures
and
special
rules
in
the
military
that
would
not
be
available
in
our
civilian
system
which
is
bound
by
a
different
and
more
rigid
set
of
rules.
the
impact
on
the
sailor
who's
convicted
at
a
summary
court
is
far
less
than
in
gault
on
the
juvenile
who
might
be
sent
away
until
he
is
age
21
and
morrissey
on
the
parolee
who
might
lose
several
years
of
goodtime,
allowances,
and
have
other
significant
consequences.
now,
finally,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
the
effect
on
the
fairness
of
the
system
and
on
its
constitutionality
of
the
option
to
reject
a
summary
court.
the
serviceman
has
a
right
to
counsel.
he
can
exercise
it
by
rejecting
the
non-adversarial
procedure
that
is
offered
to
him
with
the
summary
court.
now,
it
is
true
that
if
he
rejects
it
he
exposes
himself
to
the
punishment
of
a
special
court
if
the
commanding
officer
decides
to
convene
a
special
court
rather
than
to
resort
to
non-judicial
punishment
or
to
dismiss
the
charges
all
together.
now,
there's
been
some
discussion
of
the
jackson
case
in
this
connection
and
i
would
like
to
say,
first
of
all,
that
we
don't
think
jackson
is
controlling,
in
part
because
it's
a
bootstrapping
--
well,
i
guess
my
time
has
expired
so
--
