justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
--
upon
the
cancellation
of
parole
and
probation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
also
--
you
go
to
--
you
could
go
to
jail
without
counsel
too.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
sometimes
you
might
have
it,
and
sometimes
you
might
not.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
--
but,
at
least
in
the
--
i
know
you're
not
supporting
that
result,
but
at
least
the
gagnon
in
the
probation
of
parole,
here's
an
instance
where
the
court
said
you
are
not
entitled
to
counsel
every
single
time
you
might
--
you
think
you
might
face
imprisonment.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
frey,
you
just
--
mr.
frey,
you
just
suggested
that
the
government
would
not
support
the
daigle
formulation.
do
i
--
am
i
to
infer
from
that
that
if
there
is
to
be
a
right
to
counsel,
that
you'd
rather
have
a
forthright
argersinger
and
then
the
daigle
formulation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
daigle
relied
on
gagnon,
i
think,
didn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
we'd
rather
not
have
any
but
if
you
--
if
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
this
is
to
be
affirmed,
you
don't
want
the
daigle
formulation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
is
review
of
this
proceeding.
there
is
administrative
review
of
a
summary
court
conviction.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is
a
court
review.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
if
the
state
provides
a
two
level
criminal
trial
for
certain
kinds
of
crimes,
and
if
you
are
charged
with
a
certain
kind
of
a
crime
you
are
tried
in
a
municipal
court
or
something
like
that.
no
jury
trial.
no
jury
trial
but
you
can
appeal
that
you
are
convicted
and
have
a
trial
de
novo.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now?
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yeah,
i
thought
you
would.
i
would
think
you
would.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
in
my
example,
i
gave
you
on
the
two-tier
system,
if
you
opt
for
the
jury
trial
in
the
first
instance,
you
face
a
higher
penalty
in
some
of
these
states
systems.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
only
way
to
give
him
six
months
is
to
give
him
a
special
court.
and
special
court
could
be
the
captain
again,
couldn’t
it?
it
just
has
to
be
an
officer.
so
there
must
have
been
some
reason
for
making
this
special
court
able
to
give
time.
it
must
have
been
more
due
process,
i
would
assume
and
it
develops
it
is
no
more
due
process
than
the
captain’s
mask.
