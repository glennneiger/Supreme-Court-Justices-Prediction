as
i
understand
it,
under
article
20
of
the
uniform
military
code,
an
enlisted
man
has
the
privilege
of
not
being
tried
by
summary
court,
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
then
what
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
then
what
happens
to
him?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
he
has
a
good
defense
with
the
assistance
of
defense
counsel,
presumably
he'd
get
off.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
refer
to
the
summary
court
as
exercising
prosecutorial
functions.
my
reading
of
the
regulations
indicate
that
the
summary
court
has
a
duty
to
function
not
as
a
prosecutor
but
as
a
fact
finding
officer
with
an
equal
responsibility
to
safeguard
the
rights
of
the
accused
and
those
of
the
government.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
differ
from
that
general
summary
of
the
regulation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
he
must
subpoena
witnesses
for
the
enlisted
man
also.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
then
before
some
of
the
administrative
tribunals
around
the
country.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
confronted
with
a
professional
prosecutor,
and
there
is
this
difference
here,
isn't
there?
whether
it's
controlling
or
not
is
an
issue
obviously,
but
in
the
argersinger
situation,
the
city
or
county
prosecutor
is
there
in
court
and
if
you
are
by
yourself,
you
have
nobody
to
look
out
for
you.
but,
here,
you
have
a
man
who,
by
law,
is
required
to
be
impartial
and
to
serve
the
interest
of
both
sides.
