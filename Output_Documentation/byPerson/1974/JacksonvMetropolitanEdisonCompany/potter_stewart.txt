justice
potter
stewart
consumer
or
customer?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're
going
to
get
on
into
this
case
and
find
that
if
i
understand
it,
that
your
client
is
not
a
customer,
in
fact.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
from
the
--
that's
the
--
what
you
call
it
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
you
did
--
you
meant
any
consumer
than
rather
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
you've
been
advertently,
i
think,
then
gave
from
your
point
of
view,
the
wrong
answer
to
my
question.
you
said
consumer
and
i
said,
you
mean
consumer
or
customer,
and
you
said
customer.
i
think,
this
--
your
client
is
not
a
customer.
justice
potter
stewart
she's
a
former
customer
but
she
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
why,
mr.
greenberg
is
the
question
whether
the
necessity
of
light
fell
none
relevant
to
whether
or
not
it's
action
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
the
issue
here.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
there
was
no
due
process
hearing
required
until
unless
it
is
action
of
the
state
please,
that's
a
common
ground,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
confuses
everything,
wouldn't
you
agree?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
so,
necessity
of
life
fell
none
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
it's
action
of
the
state
in
your
submission,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
to
do
--
if
it
is
action
of
the
state,
then
any
state
action
that
deprives
anybody
of
liberty
or
property
has
to
be
taken
within
the
meets
and
bounds
of
due
process
and
the
question
is
what
does
due
process
required
in
here
in
this
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
due
process
was
required
and
the
question
is
what
does
due
process?
justice
potter
stewart
mean
or
requiring
in
that
--
in
a
particular
circumstance.
justice
potter
stewart
but
necessity
of
life
or
not
does
--
you're
not
arguing
that
hasn't
anything
to
do
whether
or
not
this
is
state
action
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
your
passing
a
wide
state
action
at
that
point
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
to
her?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
assumed
against
those
procedures
would
lie
in
fact
my
brother
white's
hypothetical,
he
assumed
that
there
was
a
suit
brought
against
those
procedures
and
they
were
unsuccessful,
as
i
understood
his
question.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
you
need
to
concede
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
say
safely
in
this
case
maybe
but
that's
pretty
big
concession
to
say.
justice
potter
stewart
actually,
this
case
isn't
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
court
decision
in
vermont.
justice
potter
stewart
but
again,
it
would
be
if
only
if
you
were
a
state.
the
equal
protection
clause
doesn't
apply
to
private
action,
justice
potter
stewart
private
individuals
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
consumer
or
customer?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we're
going
to
get
on
into
this
case
and
find
that
if

that

that's

the
