mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
case
involves
whether
a
public
utility
which
provides
electricity
under
a
grant
of
monopoly
conferred
by
the
state
which
possesses
under
state
law
various
and
considerable
powers
and
is
regulated
by
the
state
pervasively
may
pursuant
to
state
granted
and
approved
crimination
procedures
cut
off
a
consumer's
power
without
notice
and
hearing
for
alleged
nonpayment
of
a
disputed
bill.
mr.
jack
greenberg
customer.
our
answer
to
this
question
briefly
is
that
a
monopoly
functioning
under
such
state
granted
powers
and
regulations
which
supplies
a
necessity
of
life
performed
state
action
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
sense,
and
with
respect
to
its
crimination
procedures
must
accord
due
process
of
law.
and
in
a
case
like
this,
due
process
of
law
requires
some
sort
of
fair
notice
and
hearing
procedures
before
termination.
to
confront
the
petitioner's
position
more
precisely,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
our
suggestion
on
the
hearing
procedure,
the
hearing
on
crimination
would
be
that
we
adopt
the
position
of
the
brief
amicus
curiae
of
the
new
york
state
public
utilities
commission.
and
that
is
that
the
cause
should
be
sent
or
should
be
reversed
in
fact
of
the
district
court
with
an
invitation
--
the
district
court
extending
an
invitation
or
perhaps
requiring
the
state
public
utilities
commission
to
come
in
and
together
fashioning
a
fair
termination
hearing
procedure
of
the
cases
of
this
court
and
elsewhere
demonstrate
that
a
large
variety
of
procedures
could
possibly
accord
with
the
requirements
of
due
process
of
law
and
we
do
not
argue
for
any
particular
kind
of
procedure.
once
a
procedure
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
this
particular
case
would
be
whether
or
not
the
consumer
was
liable
for
the
payment
of
this
disputed
bill
and
if
so,
how
much?
mr.
jack
greenberg
not
in
this
particular
case,
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
again,
i
think
the
brief
of
the
new
york
state
public
utilities
commission
is
very
useful
and
that
is
typically
the
dispute
--
the
kind
of
dispute
and
frequently
those
kinds
of
disputes
are
resolved
by
sending
out
an
independent
meter
reader
but
they
sometimes
may
involve
other
kinds
of
issue
that
may
have
to
be
regarded
in
other
way.
in
this
particular
case
that
would
be
the
only
issue.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i'm
not.
and
i
would
confess.
i
was
slightly
puzzled
by
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
and
i'm
--
synonymously.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
one
of
the
issues
that
it's
been
raised
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
however,
we
would
submit
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
quite
assuredly
has
standing
to
raise
issues
presented
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
this
is
service
to
her
home.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
company
in
view
to
such.
they
are
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
they
came
to
her
and
they
asked
her
to
get
$30.00
by
monday
because
the
power
is
going
to
her
home
and
they're
looking
her
as
being
responsible
and
liable
for
paying
this
bill.
so,
perhaps
that's
why
i
view
them
synonymously
because
i
think
this
implicates
the
standing
issue.
they
are
looking
to
her
for
payment
of
the
bill
and
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
they're
raising
the
issue
that
someone
else
really
is
responsible
for
it
but
both
courts
below
and
the
respondent
in
this
case
have
treated
the
case
as
if
she
owes
the
money.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
money
has
been
paid.
we
haven't
had
a
hearing,
we
don't
know
that
maybe
the
money
has
not
been
paid
and
someone
is
liable
for
it
and
it
may
be
that
she
indeed
is
liable
for
it.
there
hasn't
been
a
hearing
and
one
can't
tell.
but
they've
been
treating
her
as
the
one
who's
responsible
for
the
bills.
so
that's
what
in
my
mind,
consumer
and
customer
were
synonymous
though
in
some
cases,
they
might
not
be.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
amount
due
for
all
we
know
may
have
been
paid.
i
think
as
i
have
discussed
the
issues
in
this
case
with
other
lawyers
and
students
and
others.
i
have
not
made
a
person
to
whom
either
i
mistaken
though
as
not
been
sent
or
who
doesn't
know
someone
to
whom
as
mistaken
though
was
sent
and
it's
not
an
uncommon
thing,
it
maybe
the
bill
was
paid.
there
hasn't
been
a
hearing.
no
one
has
--
in
fact,
she
has
not
yet
received
the
bill
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
they
did
both.
an
employee
of
the
company
came
to
her
house
in
the
thursday
and
said,
have
$30.00
by
monday.
and
on
monday,
employees
of
the
company
came
there
and
without
anything
being
said,
they
terminated
her
power.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
was
never
any
power
for
seeking
a
judgment
against
him.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
cutting
off
of
power
but
throughout
this
case,
they
maintained
until
now
that
they're
cut
it
off
because
she
has
not
paid
the
bill.
now,
they
claim,
there
are
some
standing
issues
that
they
might
be
in
another
way.
mr.
jack
greenberg
under
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
blackmun,
they
have
not
sent
her
any
bills
and
i
think
that
may
perhaps
be
preserved
some
legal
position
they
are
asserting
that
they
haven't
said.
however,
she's
been
budgeting
and
putting
money
away
in
savings
account
for
the
day
when
the
bill
arrives.
mr.
jack
greenberg
without
a
doubt
and
in
fact,
at
a
point
of
my
argument
when
i
discussed
some
of
the
issues
that
might
arise
under
fair
hearing
procedures
that
certainly
could
be
a
condition
precedent
to
a
hearing.
that
is
the
paying
of
some
undisputed
amount
or
some
basic
amount
or
something
else
so,
without
a
doubt.
i'd
like
to
define
petitioner's
position
on
the
state
action
point
little
more
precisely
before
proceeding
with
the
rest
of
my
argument.
and
that
is,
it
does
not
necessarily
imply
that
a
state
action
standard
must
be
applied
to
any
of
the
utilities
action
other
than
those
involving
the
furnishing
of
electricity
for
which
it
was
granted
its
monopoly
powers.
for
example,
the
right
of
the
utility
to
have
a
religious
display
of
its
headquarters
or
to
regulate
the
speech
of
its
employees
or
to
respect
their
privacy
and
so
forth,
it
involves
other
factors
which
need
not
be
considered
here.
and
we
do
not
contend
that
a
supplier
who
does
not
enjoy
a
state
conferred
monopoly
of
a
necessity
of
life
or
anyone
else
is
by
the
due
process
clause
required
to
grant
notice
in
hearing
before
cutting
off,
for
example,
milk
deliveries
or
gasoline
or
credit
or
so
forth.
in
those
cases,
the
consumer
can
always
turn
to
another
source
and
such
a
case
also
could
consider
other
factors.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
is
a
part
of
the
argument
only
in
the
sense
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
third
circuit
in
deciding
either
the
state
action
issue
or
the
fair
hearing
issue
or
both
would
somewhat
merge
together
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
makes
a
point
that
the
furnishing
of
electricity
is
not
state
action
when
the
relationship
to
a
subscriber
is
concerned.
and
they
note
that
if
might
be
state
action
if
a
whole
community
were
involved
and
they
point
out
that
the
cessation
of
electricity
wouldn't
impute
water
purification,
and
hospitals,
and
communications,
and
so
forth.
we
submit
that
that's
far
to
narrow
a
view
that
when
a
consumer's
powers
cut
off
when
she
has
essentially
cut
off
from
the
energy
system
that
has
neither
heat
nor
light
nor
refrigeration.
the
observation
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
she
can't
operate
her
oil
burner
manually
and
used
kerosene
lamps
and
put
ice
in
the
refrigerator
is
you
know,
is
ill
taken
that
this
really
is
the
furnishing
of
necessity
of
life
and
that
in
a
modern
society,
it
would
be
infrastructure
that
we
have
that
it
is
the
furnishing
of
something
as
essential
and
vital
to
the
community
as
the
same
munn
against
illinois.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
do
not
contend
for
that.
in
this
case,
we
condone
--
contend
only
for
a
monopoly
with
regard
to
the
service
as
the
monopoly
was
going
to
its
power
so
furnish
when
those
services
ours
is
typically
the
case
when
the
state
granted
monopoly,
a
necessity
of
life
and
we
would
place
in
just
the
clearest
category
electricity
and
water
and
there
might
be
several
other
functions
as
well.
but
we
would
--
we
assert
the
argument
as
narrow
which
i
just
stated.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
hospital
care
would
involve
questionable
alternatives.
one,
perhaps
can
go
to
a
variety
of
hospitals
in
many
communities
but
if
your
power
is
cut
off,
there's
no
place
else
you
can
go.
and
if
your
water
is
cut
off,
there's
no
place
else
you
can
go.
if
there
are
only
one
hospital
in
the
community,
it
might
be
one
case.
that
is
not
always
the
situation.
i
would
guess
that's
rarely
the
situation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it's
not
relevant
to
whether
it's
action
of
the
state.
it's
relevant
as
to
whether
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it's
relevant
to
whether
a
due
process
hearing
is
required
in
these
circumstances.
the
action
of
the
state
obviously
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
find
that
others
too
sometimes
tend
to
and
perhaps
the
law
merged
to
questions
together.
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
did.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
does
but
i'm
responding
to
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
decisions
on
which
we're
taking
to
this
court.
certainly,
they
have
first
must
be
action
of
the
state.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
there's
action
of
the
state
whether
it's
a
necessity
of
life
or
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right
but
it
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
a
due
process
hearing
is
required.
this
court
in
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
doesn't
require
a
hearing.
obviously,
in
roth
against
the
university,
the
action
of
the
state
was
involved
but
a
hearing
wasn't
required
because
it
was
not
that
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
subscribe
to
announce
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
was
trying
to
speak
in
terms
of
how
many
of
the
decisions
of
free
to
the
subject
in
a
brief
argument.
i
thought
i
would
speak
in
the
language
that
a
lot
of
the
decisions
used.
obviously,
first,
there
must
be
action
of
the
state.
if
there's
action
of
the
state,
there
must
be
due
process.
due
process
sometimes
requires
a
hearing
and
sometimes
does
not
require
a
hearing.
sometimes
due
process
can
be
satisfied
by
other
procedures.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
but
it
certainly
does
have
to
do
with
whether
or
not
a
hearing
is
required
and
i
think
the
opinion
speak
of
that
does
the
petitioner
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
does
he
have
an
option.
if
roth
can
get
a
job
in
another
university
that's
something
to
be
taken
into
account,
if
one
is
limited
to
a
particular
situation
that
that's
not
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
powell,
i
believe
i
would.
however,
i
must
say,
that
whether
state
action
exist
or
not
involves
a
mass
of
factors
have
to
be
put
together
in
weight.
and
i
think
even
without
the
tariff
being
filed,
and
approved,
and
promulgated,
and
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
think
the
state
granted
monopoly
powers
and
the
various
regulation
and
so
forth
would
be
sufficient.
now,
if
you
start
chipping
away
one
factor
after
another,
at
some
point.
i
would
have
to
say,
well
that's
not
enough
to
make
state
action
under
let
us
say
the
burden
asked
that's
to
select
that.
but
i
think
if
you
took
away
only
that,
yes
there
would
state
action.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it
would
be.
we've
just
taken
the
cable
television
out
of
our
apartment
because
children
look
at
it
too
much
and
i
think,
everybody
functions
perfectly
happily
well,
and
they
can
look
at
the
television
that
comes
over
the
regular,
regular
antenna.
i
do
not
--
we
would
not
think
that
there
would
state
action
at
all.
we
would
not
think
there
would
be
a
hearing,
a
hearing
to
be
required
by
due
process.
now,
this
case
involves
a
number
of
factors,
some
of
which
i
have
already
eluded
to.
a
way
by
this
court
in
determining
whether
a
notice
and
hearing
are
required
before
summary
action
maybe
taken
as
in
summary
termination
of
employment
or
disposes
or
repossession
or
garnishee
cases.
and
briefly,
those
factors
are
and
i
will
just
refer
to
a
number
that
i
consider
to
be
among
the
most
important
of
them.
what
is
the
expectation
in
the
funds,
service,
jobs
or
so
forth
of
the
one
claiming
the
hearing?
mr.
jack
greenberg
for
the
moment.
second,
what
is
the
effect
of
summary
termination
on
him?
three,
what
alternatives
does
he
have?
four,
what
is
the
effect
on
the
community
in
taking
time
for
a
hearing?
five,
what
costs
are
involved?
six,
what
is
the
likelihood
that
the
taking
is
wrongful?
and
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
these
points
somewhat.
the
first
is
what
is
the
expectation
in
the
subject
matter
concerning
which
a
hearing
is
claimed
before
termination?
if
it
is
sufficient,
it
is
deemed
to
be
a
property
right,
although,
this
case
also
can
be
viewed
as
involving
liberty
because
when
one's
power
is
cut
off,
one
is
left
in
the
dark
and
the
cold.
it
certainly
is
a
circumscription
of
one's
liberty.
the
expectation
in
continuous
service
is
one
which
subscribers
to
the
utility
have
by
virtue
of
statute.
section
1171
of
the
public
utilities
code
requires
reasonably
continuous
service
without
delays
and
unreasonable
interruptions.
decisions
of
the
public
utility
commission
which
are
not
cited
in
the
briefs
but
they're
published
such
as
westinghouse
club
against
pennsylvania
water
company
which
is
october
8,
1935;
laffey
against
manufacturers
light
and
heat,
august
27,
1934
and
pishnery
versus
brownsville
water
company,
june
12,
1928
and
numerous
other
decisions.
these
are
only
three
out
of
several
score
hold
its
service
may
not
be
terminated
for
nonpayment
of
a
disputed
bill.
but
there
is
no
meaningful
way
to
enforce
this
right
because
there
was
no
right
to
a
hearing
before
cut
off.
counsel
in
this
very
case,
i
might
add,
has
petitioned
the
public
utilities
commission
on
july
25th
and
31st,
1973
on
behalf
of
this
petitioner
and
others,
in
a
complaint
alleging
that
they
are
subject
to
having
their
water
service
cut-off
for
nonpayment
of
bills
without
prior
hearing.
and
the
commission
on
march
20th,
1974
dismissed
the
complaint
as
failing
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
it
treated
them
as
requesting
a
rule
allowing
installment
payments
to
be
made
on
bills
but
deferred
action
even
on
that
until
after
this
court
rules
in
this
case.
therefore,
we
submit
that
petitioner's
expectation
is
sufficient
to
rise
to
the
level
of
property
and
liberty
protected
by
the
due
process
clause,
although
state
procedures
are
inadequate
to
protect
it.
second
factor,
what
is
the
effect
of
summary
termination
on
the
one
whose
property
or
liberty
is
taken?
the
effect
in
this
case,
we
submit,
is
as
brutal,
to
use
a
term
that
appears
in
the
cases
about
the
determination
of
welfare
as
goldberg
against
kelly,
garnishing
of
wages
as
in
sniadach
which
was
said
to
drive
a
family
to
the
wall
or
termination
of
a
driver's
license
as
in
bell
against
burson
which
interfered
with
conduct
of
a
ministry.
and
despite
the
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
oil
burners
can
be
operated
manually
and
ice
can
be
used
in
refrigerators
and
kerosene
lamps
provide
adequate
illumination,
that
is
just
not
so
when
you
say
it's
common
knowledge
that
it's
not
so
in
an
urban
society
and
i
think
we
all
recall
the
near
catastrophe
when
the
power
grid
failed
in
the
northeast
and
that
affect
upon
a
single
individual
is
proportionately
the
same.
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
points
are
not
treated
in
the
brief
as
systematically
as
i'm
trying
to
present
them
in
the
argument.
they
are
perhaps
in
one
point
or
another
in
the
brief.
one
of
the
alternatives
for
the
petitioner,
petitioner
cannot
get
electricity
elsewhere.
unlike
the
employee
in
arnett
who
might
get
another
job
or
the
untenured
professor
in
roth,
who
might
get
employment
elsewhere
and
respondent's
monopoly
assures
that.
another
point
which
the
decisions
consider
is
what
may
be
the
effect
on
the
community
of
taking
time
for
notice
and
hearing.
this
is
unlike
the
case
of
poisoned
food
which
must
be
seized
before
distribution
or
narcotics
which
must
be
seized
before
they
work
the
way
and
have
their
effect
or
the
situation
of
a
bank
which
is
about
to
fail
and
then
we'll
bring
financial
failure
to
large
parts
of
the
community.
it's
not
a
case
like
that
at
all.
it
might
be
argued
that
taking
time
for
notice
and
hearing
entails
costs.
hearings
may
indeed
cost
something.
petitioner
in
theory
may
run
off
the
pressure
of
unpaid
bills
but
fair
hearing
rule
should,
could
and
as
in
new
york
and
as
has
been
suggested
by,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
blackmun,
a
requirement
that
the
temporary
restraining
order
might
have
been
continuation
of
payment
of
bills.
petitioner
might
even
be
required
to
pay
weekly
a
variety
of
measures
can
be
taken
to
assure
the
security
of
the
company.
the
passed
bill
is
owed.
the
question
is
what's
going
to
be
happening
in
the
future?
certainly,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
leaving
time
for
hearing
permits
a
petitioner
to
abscond
with
property
as
in
some
of
the
cases
this
court
has
treated.
now,
another
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
without
a
doubt.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
sure,
certainly.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
she
was
agreeable
for
doing
that.
and
i
think
that
case
wouldn't
be
here
if
they've
taken
the
$30.00
and
restore,
you
know,
and
allow
her
electricity
to
continue.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
record
says,
they
said,
“have
$30.00
by
monday”
and
she
said,
“okay.”
that's
all
the
record
says.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
because
when
they
came
on
monday
morning,
they
just
cut
off
the
electricity
and
wouldn't
talk
to
her.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
they
would
have
in
this
case
because
the
only
thing
--
the
only
thing
that
we
know
is
that
they
came
on
thursday
and
said,
“have
$30.00
by
monday”
and
they
came
on
monday
and
they
wouldn't
talk
to
her.
they
cut
her
off.
she
called
them
several
times
and
the
office
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
i
think
the
due
process
clause
would
have
been
satisfied.
i
just
said,
i
don't
think
we'd
have
a
case
here.
they
just
would
have
settled
it
between
the
due
process
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
no
mr.
justice
white
because
while
she's
not
received
the
bill,
her
counsel
had
been,
i
mean,
the
company's
counsel
have
informed
her
counsel
as
set
forth
in
the
complaint
that
she
owns
a
$110.00.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
so,
the
$110.00
is
for
past
due
date,
at
least
that's
what
they
told
her
lawyer.
they
going
to
sent
her
bill.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
they
claimed
the
--
one
can
interpret
the
$30.00
episode
as
saying,
“give
us
a
$30.00
down
payment
on
the
$110.00
that
you
owe
us
past
due.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
issue
in
the
case,
is
she
entitled
to
notice
in
hearing
before
cut
off?
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
she
claims
that
she
doesn't
owe
anything.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
we
would
submit
in
this
case
that
she
is
required
to
notice
and
hearing
before
she's
required
to
pay
any
money
on
the
past
bill.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
she
didn't
at
that
time.
she
was
in
welfare
at
that
time,
she's
employed
now.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
presumably,
yes.
she
would
have,
you
know,
as
i
said
pay
the
$2.00
even
though
she
wasn't
--
she
wasn't
liable
for
it.
i
mean,
her
submission
is
that
she
is
entitled
to
notice
in
a
hearing
before
cut
off.
she's
a
continuing
subscriber
to
the
company
while
one
hopes,
one
cannot
exclude
the
possibility
that
something
like
this
will
happen
again.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right
and
the
issue
is
this
sufficient
property
right
of
some
of
the
cases
referred
to
it,
so
that
there
has
to
be
notice
in
hearing
before
her
--
before
her
right
of
is
set
before
the
property's
cut
off.
mr.
jack
greenberg
or
maybe
more.
maybe
the
entire
(voice
overlap)
they
first
have
$30.00
--
they
first
have
$30.00
then
they
told
her
lawyer
$110.00.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
may
not
be
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
because
i'm
not
certain
that
that's
the
fact
because
she
has
--
she
has
made
some
tenders
of
partial
payment
and
they
haven't
wanted
to
take
it.
so,
it's
not
known
what
it
is
they
want
from
her.
they
haven't
submitted
a
bill
to
her.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
record
only
--
the
records
in
some
of
the
opinions
refer
and
except
the
fact
that
she
made
some
efforts
to
make
partial
payment
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
was
the
some
of
the
--
or
the
only
burden
on
the
person
whose
garnishing
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
she
could've
--
she
could've
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
she
could've
put
up
the
money
first,
in
what
amount
one
does
not
know
because
the
linemen
said
have
$30.00
but
she
has
never
received
the
bill.
it
is
without
a
doubt
who
she
might
have
done
something
which
might
have
satisfied
them.
without
a
hearing,
we
can't
tell
what
that
is
so,
without
a
bill
or
without
some
representation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
it
might
--
it
might
involve
very
much
more.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
come
up
the
same
way,
yes.
but
i
think
it
says
--
but
i
think
it
may
involve
very
much
more.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
(voice
overlap)
i
would
submit
that
the
state
action
issue
in
the
case
is
really
no
issue
at
all.
i
can't
imagine
for
a
moment
that
anyone
would
say
that
it
is
not
state
action
if
this
electric
company
decided
that
it
was
not
going
to
furnish
electricity
to
black
people
or
it
not
going
to
furnish
electricity
to
mexicans.
i
think
the
state
action
question
is
manifest
but
issue
is
what
happens
upon
a
finding
and
a
recognition
of
the
obvious
existence
of
state
action
in
this
case.
now,
there
has
been
some
talk
about
public
utilities
commission
against
pollak
and
how
this
case
is
different
because
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
had
denied
equal
protection
of
law.
the
state
had
denied
as
the
same
basis
as
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
was
--
it
is
state
action
and
equal
protection.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
--
in
the
schools
against
the
united
states,
the
state
law
said,
the
sheriff
wasn't
allowed
to
beat
people
up.
but
if
this
utility
had
as
part
of
its
tariffs,
the
right
to
use
force
and
violence
to
go
and
read
the
meter
and
collect
the
bill.
i
would
assume
that
that
utility
meter
reader
and
collect
acting
pursuant
to
a
tariff
would
be
engage
in
state
action
and
utility
would
be
liable
for
--
under
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
he
was
acting
contrary
to
state
law.
that
now
i
assume
that
was
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
you're
doing
it
pursuant
to
a
tariff
approved
by
the
public
utilities
commission
saying
that
that's
something
to
be
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
tariff
authorizes
into
use
force
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
am
assuming
a
tariff
which
authorize
a
meter
reader
to
use
self-help
in
order
to
carry
out
the
policies
and
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
i
was
responding
to
the
--
to
the
suggestion
that
he
might
be
acting
contrary
to
state
law.
well,
turning
to
the
pollak
case
for
a
moment,
this
case
is
indeed
quite
like
the
pollak
case
because
the
respondent's
brief
demonstrates
1971
and
1972
tariffs
including
this
particular
regulation
promulgated.
after
a
hearing
addressed
to
the
question
of
rights
but
the
rights
and
the
termination
procedures
were
part
of
the
same
regulations
which
were
promulgated.
and
the
company
makes
a
point,
and
i
think
correct
me
so,
saying
that
its
termination
procedures
and
its
rights
are
inextricably
into
client.
termination
procedures
determine
its
cost
of
collection
and
the
--
its
credit
practices
and
so
forth.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
case
involves
whether
a
public
utility
which
provides
electricity
under
a
grant
of
monopoly
conferred
by
the
state
which
possesses
under
state
law
various
and
considerable
powers
and
is
regulated
by
the
state
pervasively
may
pursuant
to
state
granted
and
approved
crimination
procedures
cut
off
a
consumer's
power
without
notice
and
hearing
for
alleged
nonpayment
of
a
disputed
bill.
mr.
jack
greenberg
customer.
our
answer
to
this
question
briefly
is
that
a
monopoly
functioning
under
such
state
granted
powers
and
regulations
which
supplies
a
necessity
of
life
performed
state
action
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
sense,
and
with
respect
to
its
crimination
procedures
must
accord
due
process
of
law.
and
in
a
case
like
this,
due
process
of
law
requires
some
sort
of
fair
notice
and
hearing
procedures
before
termination.
to
confront
the
petitioner's
position
more
precisely,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
our
suggestion
on
the
hearing
procedure,
the
hearing
on
crimination
would
be
that
we
adopt
the
position
of
the
brief
amicus
curiae
of
the
new
york
state
public
utilities
commission.
and
that
is
that
the
cause
should
be
sent
or
should
be
reversed
in
fact
of
the
district
court
with
an
invitation
--
the
district
court
extending
an
invitation
or
perhaps
requiring
the
state
public
utilities
commission
to
come
in
and
together
fashioning
a
fair
termination
hearing
procedure
of
the
cases
of
this
court
and
elsewhere
demonstrate
that
a
large
variety
of
procedures
could
possibly
accord
with
the
requirements
of
due
process
of
law
and
we
do
not
argue
for
any
particular
kind
of
procedure.
once
a
procedure
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
in
this
particular
case
would
be
whether
or
not
the
consumer
was
liable
for
the
payment
of
this
disputed
bill
and
if
so,
how
much?
mr.
jack
greenberg
not
in
this
particular
case,
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
again,
i
think
the
brief
of
the
new
york
state
public
utilities
commission
is
very
useful
and
that
is
typically
the
dispute
--
the
kind
of
dispute
and
frequently
those
kinds
of
disputes
are
resolved
by
sending
out
an
independent
meter
reader
but
they
sometimes
may
involve
other
kinds
of
issue
that
may
have
to
be
regarded
in
other
way.
in
this
particular
case
that
would
be
the
only
issue.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i'm
not.
and
i
would
confess.
i
was
slightly
puzzled
by
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
and
i'm
--
synonymously.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
that
is
one
of
the
issues
that
it's
been
raised
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
however,
we
would
submit
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
quite
assuredly
has
standing
to
raise
issues
presented
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
this
is
service
to
her
home.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
company
in
view
to
such.
they
are
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
they
came
to
her
and
they
asked
her
to
get
$30.00
by
monday
because
the
power
is
going
to
her
home
and
they're
looking
her
as
being
responsible
and
liable
for
paying
this
bill.
so,
perhaps
that's
why
i
view
them
synonymously
because
i
think
this
implicates
the
standing
issue.
they
are
looking
to
her
for
payment
of
the
bill
and
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
they're
raising
the
issue
that
someone
else
really
is
responsible
for
it
but
both
courts
below
and
the
respondent
in
this
case
have
treated
the
case
as
if
she
owes
the
money.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
money
has
been
paid.
we
haven't
had
a
hearing,
we
don't
know
that
maybe
the
money
has
not
been
paid
and
someone
is
liable
for
it
and
it
may
be
that
she
indeed
is
liable
for
it.
there
hasn't
been
a
hearing
and
one
can't
tell.
but
they've
been
treating
her
as
the
one
who's
responsible
for
the
bills.
so
that's
what
in
my
mind,
consumer
and
customer
were
synonymous
though
in
some
cases,
they
might
not
be.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
amount
due
for
all
we
know
may
have
been
paid.
i
think
as
i
have
discussed
the
issues
in
this
case
with
other
lawyers
and
students
and
others.
i
have
not
made
a
person
to
whom
either
i
mistaken
though
as
not
been
sent
or
who
doesn't
know
someone
to
whom
as
mistaken
though
was
sent
and
it's
not
an
uncommon
thing,
it
maybe
the
bill
was
paid.
there
hasn't
been
a
hearing.
no
one
has
--
in
fact,
she
has
not
yet
received
the
bill
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
they
did
both.
an
employee
of
the
company
came
to
her
house
in
the
thursday
and
said,
have
$30.00
by
monday.
and
on
monday,
employees
of
the
company
came
there
and
without
anything
being
said,
they
terminated
her
power.
mr.
jack
greenberg
there
was
never
any
power
for
seeking
a
judgment
against
him.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
cutting
off
of
power
but
throughout
this
case,
they
maintained
until
now
that
they're
cut
it
off
because
she
has
not
paid
the
bill.
now,
they
claim,
there
are
some
standing
issues
that
they
might
be
in
another
way.
mr.
jack
greenberg
under
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
blackmun,
they
have
not
sent
her
any
bills
and
i
think
that
may
perhaps
be
preserved
some
legal
position
they
are
asserting
that
they
haven't
said.
however,
she's
been
budgeting
and
putting
money
away
in
savings
account
for
the
day
when
the
bill
arrives.
mr.
jack
greenberg
without
a
doubt
and
in
fact,
at
a
point
of
my
argument
when
i
discussed
some
of
the
issues
that
might
arise
under
fair
hearing
procedures
that
certainly
could
be
a
condition
precedent
to
a
hearing.
that
is
the
paying
of
some
undisputed
amount
or
some
basic
amount
or
something
else
so,
without
a
doubt.
i'd
like
to
define
petitioner's
position
on
the
state
action
point
little
more
precisely
before
proceeding
with
the
rest
of
my
argument.
and
that
is,
it
does
not
necessarily
imply
that
a
state
action
standard
must
be
applied
to
any
of
the
utilities
action
other
than
those
involving
the
furnishing
of
electricity
for
which
it
was
granted
its
monopoly
powers.
for
example,
the
right
of
the
utility
to
have
a
religious
display
of
its
headquarters
or
to
regulate
the
speech
of
its
employees
or
to
respect
their
privacy
and
so
forth,
it
involves
other
factors
which
need
not
be
considered
here.
and
we
do
not
contend
that
a
supplier
who
does
not
enjoy
a
state
conferred
monopoly
of
a
necessity
of
life
or
anyone
else
is
by
the
due
process
clause
required
to
grant
notice
in
hearing
before
cutting
off,
for
example,
milk
deliveries
or
gasoline
or
credit
or
so
forth.
in
those
cases,
the
consumer
can
always
turn
to
another
source
and
such
a
case
also
could
consider
other
factors.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
is
a
part
of
the
argument
only
in
the
sense
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
third
circuit
in
deciding
either
the
state
action
issue
or
the
fair
hearing
issue
or
both
would
somewhat
merge
together
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
makes
a
point
that
the
furnishing
of
electricity
is
not
state
action
when
the
relationship
to
a
subscriber
is
concerned.
and
they
note
that
if
might
be
state
action
if
a
whole
community
were
involved
and
they
point
out
that
the
cessation
of
electricity
wouldn't
impute
water
purification,
and
hospitals,
and
communications,
and
so
forth.
we
submit
that
that's
far
to
narrow
a
view
that
when
a
consumer's
powers
cut
off
when
she
has
essentially
cut
off
from
the
energy
system
that
has
neither
heat
nor
light
nor
refrigeration.
the
observation
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
she
can't
operate
her
oil
burner
manually
and
used
kerosene
lamps
and
put
ice
in
the
refrigerator
is
you
know,
is
ill
taken
that
this
really
is
the
furnishing
of
necessity
of
life
and
that
in
a
modern
society,
it
would
be
infrastructure
that
we
have
that
it
is
the
furnishing
of
something
as
essential
and
vital
to
the
community
as
the
same
munn
against
illinois.
mr.
jack
greenberg
we
do
not
contend
for
that.
in
this
case,
we
condone
--
contend
only
for
a
monopoly
with
regard
to
the
service
as
the
monopoly
was
going
to
its
power
so
furnish
when
those
services
ours
is
typically
the
case
when
the
state
granted
monopoly,
a
necessity
of
life
and
we
would
place
in
just
the
clearest
category
electricity
and
water
and
there
might
be
several
other
functions
as
well.
but
we
would
--
we
assert
the
argument
as
narrow
which
i
just
stated.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
hospital
care
would
involve
questionable
alternatives.
one,
perhaps
can
go
to
a
variety
of
hospitals
in
many
communities
but
if
your
power
is
cut
off,
there's
no
place
else
you
can
go.
and
if
your
water
is
cut
off,
there's
no
place
else
you
can
go.
if
there
are
only
one
hospital
in
the
community,
it
might
be
one
case.
that
is
not
always
the
situation.
i
would
guess
that's
rarely
the
situation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it's
not
relevant
to
whether
it's
action
of
the
state.
it's
relevant
as
to
whether
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it's
relevant
to
whether
a
due
process
hearing
is
required
in
these
circumstances.
the
action
of
the
state
obviously
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
find
that
others
too
sometimes
tend
to
and
perhaps
the
law
merged
to
questions
together.
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
did.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
it
does
but
i'm
responding
to
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
decisions
on
which
we're
taking
to
this
court.
certainly,
they
have
first
must
be
action
of
the
state.
mr.
jack
greenberg
and
there's
action
of
the
state
whether
it's
a
necessity
of
life
or
not.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right
but
it
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
a
due
process
hearing
is
required.
this
court
in
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
doesn't
require
a
hearing.
obviously,
in
roth
against
the
university,
the
action
of
the
state
was
involved
but
a
hearing
wasn't
required
because
it
was
not
that
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
subscribe
to
announce
mr.
justice
stewart.
i
was
trying
to
speak
in
terms
of
how
many
of
the
decisions
of
free
to
the
subject
in
a
brief
argument.
i
thought
i
would
speak
in
the
language
that
a
lot
of
the
decisions
used.
obviously,
first,
there
must
be
action
of
the
state.
if
there's
action
of
the
state,
there
must
be
due
process.
due
process
sometimes
requires
a
hearing
and
sometimes
does
not
require
a
hearing.
sometimes
due
process
can
be
satisfied
by
other
procedures.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
but
it
certainly
does
have
to
do
with
whether
or
not
a
hearing
is
required
and
i
think
the
opinion
speak
of
that
does
the
petitioner
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
does
he
have
an
option.
if
roth
can
get
a
job
in
another
university
that's
something
to
be
taken
into
account,
if
one
is
limited
to
a
particular
situation
that
that's
not
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
mr.
justice
powell,
i
believe
i
would.
however,
i
must
say,
that
whether
state
action
exist
or
not
involves
a
mass
of
factors
have
to
be
put
together
in
weight.
and
i
think
even
without
the
tariff
being
filed,
and
approved,
and
promulgated,
and
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
think
the
state
granted
monopoly
powers
and
the
various
regulation
and
so
forth
would
be
sufficient.
now,
if
you
start
chipping
away
one
factor
after
another,
at
some
point.
i
would
have
to
say,
well
that's
not
enough
to
make
state
action
under
let
us
say
the
burden
asked
that's
to
select
that.
but
i
think
if
you
took
away
only
that,
yes
there
would
state
action.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
it
would
be.
we've
just
taken
the
cable
television
out
of
our
apartment
because
children
look
at
it
too
much
and
i
think,
everybody
functions
perfectly
happily
well,
and
they
can
look
at
the
television
that
comes
over
the
regular,
regular
antenna.
i
do
not
--
we
would
not
think
that
there
would
state
action
at
all.
we
would
not
think
there
would
be
a
hearing,
a
hearing
to
be
required
by
due
process.
now,
this
case
involves
a
number
of
factors,
some
of
which
i
have
already
eluded
to.
a
way
by
this
court
in
determining
whether
a
notice
and
hearing
are
required
before
summary
action
maybe
taken
as
in
summary
termination
of
employment
or
disposes
or
repossession
or
garnishee
cases.
and
briefly,
those
factors
are
and
i
will
just
refer
to
a
number
that
i
consider
to
be
among
the
most
important
of
them.
what
is
the
expectation
in
the
funds,
service,
jobs
or
so
forth
of
the
one
claiming
the
hearing?
mr.
jack
greenberg
for
the
moment.
second,
what
is
the
effect
of
summary
termination
on
him?
three,
what
alternatives
does
he
have?
four,
what
is
the
effect
on
the
community
in
taking
time
for
a
hearing?
five,
what
costs
are
involved?
six,
what
is
the
likelihood
that
the
taking
is
wrongful?
and
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
these
points
somewhat.
the
first
is
what
is
the
expectation
in
the
subject
matter
concerning
which
a
hearing
is
claimed
before
termination?
if
it
is
sufficient,
it
is
deemed
to
be
a
property
right,
although,
this
case
also
can
be
viewed
as
involving
liberty
because
when
one's
power
is
cut
off,
one
is
left
in
the
dark
and
the
cold.
it
certainly
is
a
circumscription
of
one's
liberty.
the
expectation
in
continuous
service
is
one
which
subscribers
to
the
utility
have
by
virtue
of
statute.
section
1171
of
the
public
utilities
code
requires
reasonably
continuous
service
without
delays
and
unreasonable
interruptions.
decisions
of
the
public
utility
commission
which
are
not
cited
in
the
briefs
but
they're
published
such
as
westinghouse
club
against
pennsylvania
water
company
which
is
october
8,
1935;
laffey
against
manufacturers
light
and
heat,
august
27,
1934
and
pishnery
versus
brownsville
water
company,
june
12,
1928
and
numerous
other
decisions.
these
are
only
three
out
of
several
score
hold
its
service
may
not
be
terminated
for
nonpayment
of
a
disputed
bill.
but
there
is
no
meaningful
way
to
enforce
this
right
because
there
was
no
right
to
a
hearing
before
cut
off.
counsel
in
this
very
case,
i
might
add,
has
petitioned
the
public
utilities
commission
on
july
25th
and
31st,
1973
on
behalf
of
this
petitioner
and
others,
in
a
complaint
alleging
that
they
are
subject
to
having
their
water
service
cut-off
for
nonpayment
of
bills
without
prior
hearing.
and
the
commission
on
march
20th,
1974
dismissed
the
complaint
as
failing
to
state
a
cause
of
action.
it
treated
them
as
requesting
a
rule
allowing
installment
payments
to
be
made
on
bills
but
deferred
action
even
on
that
until
after
this
court
rules
in
this
case.
therefore,
we
submit
that
petitioner's
expectation
is
sufficient
to
rise
to
the
level
of
property
and
liberty
protected
by
the
due
process
clause,
although
state
procedures
are
inadequate
to
protect
it.
second
factor,
what
is
the
effect
of
summary
termination
on
the
one
whose
property
or
liberty
is
taken?
the
effect
in
this
case,
we
submit,
is
as
brutal,
to
use
a
term
that
appears
in
the
cases
about
the
determination
of
welfare
as
goldberg
against
kelly,
garnishing
of
wages
as
in
sniadach
which
was
said
to
drive
a
family
to
the
wall
or
termination
of
a
driver's
license
as
in
bell
against
burson
which
interfered
with
conduct
of
a
ministry.
and
despite
the
argument
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
oil
burners
can
be
operated
manually
and
ice
can
be
used
in
refrigerators
and
kerosene
lamps
provide
adequate
illumination,
that
is
just
not
so
when
you
say
it's
common
knowledge
that
it's
not
so
in
an
urban
society
and
i
think
we
all
recall
the
near
catastrophe
when
the
power
grid
failed
in
the
northeast
and
that
affect
upon
a
single
individual
is
proportionately
the
same.
mr.
jack
greenberg
these
points
are
not
treated
in
the
brief
as
systematically
as
i'm
trying
to
present
them
in
the
argument.
they
are
perhaps
in
one
point
or
another
in
the
brief.
one
of
the
alternatives
for
the
petitioner,
petitioner
cannot
get
electricity
elsewhere.
unlike
the
employee
in
arnett
who
might
get
another
job
or
the
untenured
professor
in
roth,
who
might
get
employment
elsewhere
and
respondent's
monopoly
assures
that.
another
point
which
the
decisions
consider
is
what
may
be
the
effect
on
the
community
of
taking
time
for
notice
and
hearing.
this
is
unlike
the
case
of
poisoned
food
which
must
be
seized
before
distribution
or
narcotics
which
must
be
seized
before
they
work
the
way
and
have
their
effect
or
the
situation
of
a
bank
which
is
about
to
fail
and
then
we'll
bring
financial
failure
to
large
parts
of
the
community.
it's
not
a
case
like
that
at
all.
it
might
be
argued
that
taking
time
for
notice
and
hearing
entails
costs.
hearings
may
indeed
cost
something.
petitioner
in
theory
may
run
off
the
pressure
of
unpaid
bills
but
fair
hearing
rule
should,
could
and
as
in
new
york
and
as
has
been
suggested
by,
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
blackmun,
a
requirement
that
the
temporary
restraining
order
might
have
been
continuation
of
payment
of
bills.
petitioner
might
even
be
required
to
pay
weekly
a
variety
of
measures
can
be
taken
to
assure
the
security
of
the
company.
the
passed
bill
is
owed.
the
question
is
what's
going
to
be
happening
in
the
future?
certainly,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
leaving
time
for
hearing
permits
a
petitioner
to
abscond
with
property
as
in
some
of
the
cases
this
court
has
treated.
now,
another
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
without
a
doubt.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh
sure,
certainly.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
she
was
agreeable
for
doing
that.
and
i
think
that
case
wouldn't
be
here
if
they've
taken
the
$30.00
and
restore,
you
know,
and
allow
her
electricity
to
continue.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
record
says,
they
said,
“have
$30.00
by
monday”
and
she
said,
“okay.”
that's
all
the
record
says.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
because
when
they
came
on
monday
morning,
they
just
cut
off
the
electricity
and
wouldn't
talk
to
her.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
i
think
they
would
have
in
this
case
because
the
only
thing
--
the
only
thing
that
we
know
is
that
they
came
on
thursday
and
said,
“have
$30.00
by
monday”
and
they
came
on
monday
and
they
wouldn't
talk
to
her.
they
cut
her
off.
she
called
them
several
times
and
the
office
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
i
think
the
due
process
clause
would
have
been
satisfied.
i
just
said,
i
don't
think
we'd
have
a
case
here.
they
just
would
have
settled
it
between
the
due
process
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
no
mr.
justice
white
because
while
she's
not
received
the
bill,
her
counsel
had
been,
i
mean,
the
company's
counsel
have
informed
her
counsel
as
set
forth
in
the
complaint
that
she
owns
a
$110.00.
mr.
jack
greenberg
oh,
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
greenberg
so,
the
$110.00
is
for
past
due
date,
at
least
that's
what
they
told
her
lawyer.
they
going
to
sent
her
bill.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
they
claimed
the
--
one
can
interpret
the
$30.00
episode
as
saying,
“give
us
a
$30.00
down
payment
on
the
$110.00
that
you
owe
us
past
due.”
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
no.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
issue
in
the
case,
is
she
entitled
to
notice
in
hearing
before
cut
off?
that's
the
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
she
claims
that
she
doesn't
owe
anything.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
right.
we
would
submit
in
this
case
that
she
is
required
to
notice
and
hearing
before
she's
required
to
pay
any
money
on
the
past
bill.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
she
didn't
at
that
time.
she
was
in
welfare
at
that
time,
she's
employed
now.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
presumably,
yes.
she
would
have,
you
know,
as
i
said
pay
the
$2.00
even
though
she
wasn't
--
she
wasn't
liable
for
it.
i
mean,
her
submission
is
that
she
is
entitled
to
notice
in
a
hearing
before
cut
off.
she's
a
continuing
subscriber
to
the
company
while
one
hopes,
one
cannot
exclude
the
possibility
that
something
like
this
will
happen
again.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right.
mr.
jack
greenberg
that's
right
and
the
issue
is
this
sufficient
property
right
of
some
of
the
cases
referred
to
it,
so
that
there
has
to
be
notice
in
hearing
before
her
--
before
her
right
of
is
set
before
the
property's
cut
off.
mr.
jack
greenberg
or
maybe
more.
maybe
the
entire
(voice
overlap)
they
first
have
$30.00
--
they
first
have
$30.00
then
they
told
her
lawyer
$110.00.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
that
may
not
be
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
because
i'm
not
certain
that
that's
the
fact
because
she
has
--
she
has
made
some
tenders
of
partial
payment
and
they
haven't
wanted
to
take
it.
so,
it's
not
known
what
it
is
they
want
from
her.
they
haven't
submitted
a
bill
to
her.
mr.
jack
greenberg
the
record
only
--
the
records
in
some
of
the
opinions
refer
and
except
the
fact
that
she
made
some
efforts
to
make
partial
payment
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
was
the
some
of
the
--
or
the
only
burden
on
the
person
whose
garnishing
is
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
she
could've
--
she
could've
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
she
could've
put
up
the
money
first,
in
what
amount
one
does
not
know
because
the
linemen
said
have
$30.00
but
she
has
never
received
the
bill.
it
is
without
a
doubt
who
she
might
have
done
something
which
might
have
satisfied
them.
without
a
hearing,
we
can't
tell
what
that
is
so,
without
a
bill
or
without
some
representation.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
think
it
might
--
it
might
involve
very
much
more.
mr.
jack
greenberg
i
would
come
up
the
same
way,
yes.
but
i
think
it
says
--
but
i
think
it
may
involve
very
much
more.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jack
greenberg
(voice
overlap)
i
would
submit
that
the
state
action
issue
in
the
case
is
really
no
issue
at
all.
i
can't
imagine
for
a
moment
that
anyone
would
say
that
it
is
not
state
action
if
this
electric
company
decided
that
it
was
not
going
to
furnish
electricity
to
black
people
or
it
not
going
to
furnish
electricity
to
mexicans.
i
think
the
state
action
question
is
manifest
but
issue
is
what
happens
upon
a
finding
and
a
recognition
of
the
obvious
existence
of
state
action
in
this
case.
now,
there
has
been
some
talk
about
public
utilities
commission
against
pollak
and
how
this
case
is
different
because
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes.
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
had
denied
equal
protection
of
law.
the
state
had
denied
as
the
same
basis
as
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
it
was
--
it
is
state
action
and
equal
protection.
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
--
in
the
schools
against
the
united
states,
the
state
law
said,
the
sheriff
wasn't
allowed
to
beat
people
up.
but
if
this
utility
had
as
part
of
its
tariffs,
the
right
to
use
force
and
violence
to
go
and
read
the
meter
and
collect
the
bill.
i
would
assume
that
that
utility
meter
reader
and
collect
acting
pursuant
to
a
tariff
would
be
engage
in
state
action
and
utility
would
be
liable
for
--
under
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
he
was
acting
contrary
to
state
law.
that
now
i
assume
that
was
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
if
you're
doing
it
pursuant
to
a
tariff
approved
by
the
public
utilities
commission
saying
that
that's
something
to
be
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
well,
the
tariff
authorizes
into
use
force
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
no,
i
am
assuming
a
tariff
which
authorize
a
meter
reader
to
use
self-help
in
order
to
carry
out
the
policies
and
the
--
mr.
jack
greenberg
yes,
but
i
was
responding
to
the
--
to
the
suggestion
that
he
might
be
acting
contrary
to
state
law.
well,
turning
to
the
pollak
case
for
a
moment,
this
case
is
indeed
quite
like
the
pollak
case
because
the
respondent's
brief
demonstrates
1971
and
1972
tariffs
including
this
particular
regulation
promulgated.
after
a
hearing
addressed
to
the
question
of
rights
but
the
rights
and
the
termination
procedures
were
part
of
the
same
regulations
which
were
promulgated.
and
the
company
makes
a
point,
and
i
think
correct
me
so,
saying
that
its
termination
procedures
and
its
rights
are
inextricably
into
client.
termination
procedures
determine
its
cost
of
collection
and
the
--
its
credit
practices
and
so
forth.
