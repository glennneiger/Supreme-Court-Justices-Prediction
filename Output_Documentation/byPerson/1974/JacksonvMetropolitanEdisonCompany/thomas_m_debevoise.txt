mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
the
case
to
take
just
a
minute
to
go
back
to
the
facts
and
whether
this
is
a
termination
case
or
not.
this
28-year
old
woman
bought
a
house
in
'69.
a
year
later,
her
electricity
was
terminated
for
nonpayment
of
bills.
45
minutes
later,
in
some
manner,
it
was
reconnected
and
thereafter,
bills
did
not
come
to
her.
it
came
to
a
man
who
was
staying
at
her
house.
a
year
following
that,
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
no.
the
only
witness
was
the
petitioner
and
she
says,
that
she
has
no
idea
how
it
came
about.
but
after
that,
and
for
a
period
of
13
months,
bills
came
to
a
man
staying
in
her
house.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
and
not
to
her
and
during
that
period,
she
made
no
effort
to
pay
the
bill
that
was
outstanding
for
the
service
prior
to
that
termination.
then,
an
employee
came
on
a
wednesday
looking
for
the
man
in
the
house
and
was
inform
that
he
had
left
some
month
and
a
half,
previously.
he
also
looked
at
the
meter.
the
next
day,
another
man
came
to
the
house
and
discussed
the
situation
with
the
petitioner
and
then,
it
must
had
have
some
discussion
about
who
the
customer
was
and
termination
and
all
of
that,
because
she
testifies
that
she
told
this
man
to
put
the
electric
service
in
the
name
of
robert
jackson
to
give
me
time
to
get
the
rest
of
the
money
to
pay
the
old
bill.
robert
jackson
was
her
12-year
old
son.
three
days
later,
a
man
came
and
disconnected
the
service.
she
then
telephoned
the
company
man
who
had
been
there
the
preceding
thursday,
found
he
was
not
in
the
office
but
he
had
left
word
for
her
to
be
given
his
home
number,
so
that
she
could
call
him
at
home
which
she
did.
he
then
told
her
according
to
her
testimony.
who
was
responsible
for
the
matter
now?
another
employee
of
the
company,
she
testified,
she
never
called
them.
now,
it's
our
position
under
those
facts
that
she
was
not
a
customer
who
was
terminated
nor
did
she
apply
for
service.
she
could
still
apply
for
service.
the
company
in
view
of
the
past
history
under
the
tariff
would
have
the
right
to
require
reasonable
deposit.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
that
is
her
testimony
and
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
and
it
is
uncontradicted.
and
if
it
was
$30.00
i'm
sure
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
no,
it
recognized
that
she
was
a
former
customer
as
counsel
with
an
outstanding
bill
of
over
a
hundred
dollars.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
there
is
nothing
at
this
time
in
here
on
the
100
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
no,
your
honor.
it
isn't
tied
together
in
that
fashion.
there
is
mentioned
of
the
$30.00.
there
is
her
straightforward
admission
that
she
still
owed
the
bill
that
was
over
a
year
old.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
believe
your
honor
that
it
was
not
--
there
was
a
discussion
about
new
service
that
had
to
be
because
she
testified.
she
said,
put
in
the
name
of
robert
jackson.
now,
in
that
conversation,
there
were
some
evidently
some
mentioned
of
$30.00.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
well,
your
honor,
maybe
it
would
be
a
help
if
i
took
just
a
minute
before
getting
the
state
action
to
tell
you
the
company's
procedures
in
regard
to
delinquent
accounts.
in
'73,
1973,
there
were
217,000
notices
of
delinquent
accounts
that
went
out.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
217,000.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it
isn't,
your
honor.
there
are
very
similar
figures
in
the
city
of
philadelphia's
brief.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
in
the
service
area
of
metropolitan
edison
which
includes
more
than
new
york.
it
includes
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
somewhat
less
than
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
don't
believe
we
do,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
now,
that
goes
out
after
30
days
after
the
bill,
and
when
no
response
is
heard
to
from
that,
and
there
129,000
such
cases,
those
cases
were
referred
to
the
credit
managers.
and
the
credit
managers
then
either
in
person,
as
in
this
case,
where
they
went
out
looking
for
the
customer
or
by
phone
or
by
mail,
try
to
contact
the
customer
and
there
were
in
1973
only
4,390
terminations.
there
was
not
a
procedure
whereby,
if
a
bill
is
not
immediately
paid,
the
switch
is
pulled.
similarly,
this
is
a
matter
in
which
the
public
has
tremendous
interest.
for
instance,
fortune
reported
in
september
that
in
march
of
1974,
when
four
went
its
dividend
of
28
million,
consolidated
edison
had
outstanding
bills
of
$367,151,000.00
with
an
average
life
of
59
days,
those
bills.
the
amount
of
the
dividend
forgone
was
$28
million.
it
lost
$24.5
million
in
uncollectible
accounts
in
1973.
so,
these
procedures
on
collection
are
extremely
important
to
the
public.
last
saturday,
the
papers
carried
the
account
of
the
tremendous
cut
back
in
electric
utility
construction
that
has
been
caused
a
gain
by
a
lack
of
cash
in
these
times
of
inflation.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
state
action.
i
think
it's
maybe
posed
most
directly
by
the
california
amici
when
they
present
the
issue
that
state
action
is
present
where
a
significant
governmental
interest
are
promoted
by
a
pattern
of
regulation
delegating
state
power
to
a
extensively
private
persons
who
then
act
with
the
force
of
law.
that
is
similar
to
what
counsel
said
and
repeated
about
this
graft
of
monopoly
power.
it
didn't
work
that
way.
in
1913,
when
the
public
utility
law
of
pennsylvania
was
passed
and
the
set
forth
regulation
over
not
only
electric
utilities
but
of
course,
worth
companies,
grain
elevator
companies,
telephone
companies,
pipeline
corporations,
ferries
and
all
the
other
things.
met
ed
--
and
the
service
of
electricity
by
met
ed's
predecessors
had
been
going
on
for
a
substantial
time.
met
ed
is
still
subject
to
a
99-year
lease
under
then
to
1894
and
has
a
contract
in
perpetuity
with
the
town
of
middleton
to
sell
them
electricity
at
a
standard
kilowatt
hour
in
perpetuity
that
was
entered
into
in
1906.
so,
it
was
not
a
grant
of
state
power
that
resulted
in
the
regulated
utility
system
we
have
today.
instead,
it
was
a
recognition
that
many
businesses
are
affected
with
the
public
interest
and
the
desire
to
protect
consumer
--
consumer
led
to
their
regulation
that
being
true
in
justice
brandeis'
concurring
opinion
on
south
western
bell
and
goes
into
this
subjected
to
the
link.
that
being
true,
all
acts
of
a
public
utility
are
not
actions
of
the
state.
now,
where
the
state
has
particularly
ordered
the
electric
utility
to
do
something
and
the
utility
then
goes
out
under
color
of
not
order
and
does
something,
certainly,
that
would
be
a
type
of
action
that
would
receive
the
protection
with
that
the
petitioner
here
seeks.
on
the
other
hand,
the
filing
of
its
practices,
so
that
it's
customers
will
have
knowledge
of
its
practices.
practices
which
are
not
acted
on
by
the
state
with
the
tariff
being
filed
because
the
state
requires
you,
for
the
protection
of
your
customers,
to
let
your
customers
know
how
you're
going
to
operate?1
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
think
that
is
the
issue.
it's
whether
inaction
can
be
equated
with
action.
now,
i
have
no
question
that
an
electric
utility
operating
under
the
new
public
--
new
york
public
service
termination
procedures
would
then
be
acting
--
it
would
be
state
action.
but
where
there
has
been
no
action,
we
do
not
believe
it
should
be
extended.
it's
mentioned
in
the
briefs
that
vermont
instituted
termination
procedures.
last
week,
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
in
saying,
you
do
it
this
way.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it
accepted
a
for
filing,
i
believe
this
is
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
think
in
that
case,
that
the
company
acting
under
it
would
get
support
and
encouragement
from
state
action
and
a
suit
against
those
procedures
rely.
so
it's
strictly
a
question
of
whether
no
action
is
equivalent
to
this
type
of
approval.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
right,
but
then
the
utility
went
out
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
well,
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
well,
it
is
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
i
am
conceding
it,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
the
reasoning
behind
conceding
for
this
case
is
we
are
a
very
heavily
regulated
industry.
we
do
have
a
very
important
role
to
play.
we
do
take
our
orders
from
the
state,
the
state
courts,
the
federal
agencies,
this
court
and
we
try
to
do
things
correctly.
our
image
before
the
public
as
justice
brandeis
pointed
out
is
all
important.
we
have
only
one
way
of
making
money,
that's
to
sell
electricity.
we
don't
cut
anybody
off
unreasonably
if
we
can
help
it.
on
the
other
hand,
we
get
absolutely
no
assistance
from
any
state
or
governmental
agency
in
raising
the
funds
necessary
to
carry
on
this
business.
either
court
or
state
tells
us,
this
is
how
you
do
it.
once
we
have
exhausted
our
protection,
we
will
do
it
that
way.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
well,
that
--
that
to
me
is
not
action
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
misunderstood.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it
is.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
think
that
still
is
non-action,
justice
white.
excuse
me,
i
thought
that
they
were
directing
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
but
not
saying
that
this
is
the
way
you
have
to
do.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
right.
but,
excuse
me,
i
missed
the
innuendo.
and
in
vermont,
i
think
the
vermont
case
last
week
is
interesting.
the
supreme
court
reversed
the
public
utility
commission
where
they
have
set
up
procedures.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
unfortunately,
your
honor,
it
was
late
last
week
in
manhattan.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it's
a
court
decision.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it
is
the
rutland
herald
of
last
week,
your
honor,
reporting
the
motion
by
vermont
welfare
rights
organization
asking
the
supreme
court
to
reconsider
its
decision
voiding
the
policy
of
the
public
service
board
in
connection
with
termination
procedures.
and
the
only
reason
that
the
court
voided
was
because
the
public
service
commission
had
proceeded
without
any
factual
basis
in
the
record.
it
had
not
held
hearings
to
determine
the
circumstances
and
therefore
had
no
findings
in
support
of
their
order.
there's
no
question
that
the
public
service
commission
can
direct
these
things
after
hearings
like
the
new
york
public
service
commission's
stand.
that
is
the
utility's
protection.
if
they
are
told
to
do
something
this
way,
the
regulatory
agency
has
to
have
support
and
a
basis
because
the
utility
is
entitled
to
due
process
too.
so
in
this
case,
our
position
is
that
there
has
to
be
affirmative
action
directing.
then,
if
we
act
under
color
of
that
directive,
we
are
subjected.
in
connection
with
this
grant
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
in
the
case
that
i
can
visualize
at
the
moment,
justice
powell,
i
would,
yes.
i
mean,
if
it's
a
question
of
a
--
and
a
tariff,
once
accepted
or
approved,
your
description
of
service
is
in
there.
the
office
at
which
you
collect
your
bills
and
just
lots
and
lots
of
material
that
is
in
this
category
that
would
subject
to
change
by
filing
a
new
tariff
and
it
would
only
be
if
you
were
doing
something
unreasonable
that
a
commission
would
then
come
along
and
say,
you
must
change
the
tariff
and
do
it
this
way
and
then
i
say,
there
would
be
the
director.
so,
just
there,
acceptance
for
filing
or
approval,
i
would
if
they
could
not
act.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
exactly,
exactly,
in
all
of
the
regulated
businesses
and
there
are
very,
very
few
businesses
that
are
not
regulated
in
some
degree
today.
whether
there
are
corporations
or
individuals.
now,
i
believe,
i
covered
our
main
points
that
we
unfortunately
don't
believe
this
is
a
termination
case
because
the
petitioner
was
not
our
customer.
she
didn't
apply
for
new
service
herself,
so
it's
not
an
equal
protection
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
believe
that
there
is
no
right
to
receive
electric
service
except
under
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
there
is
a
statutory
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
without
--
exactly,
i
was
going
to
say
except
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
if
we
discriminate
it
against
her,
as
oppose
to
any
other
person
who
acquired
for
service,
i
believe
that
there
would
be
a
cause
under
the
equal
protect
clause
as
the
day
of
this
beware
case
was
holding
this
summer.
but
there's
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
excuse
me
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
there,
we
were
dealing
with
a
municipal
company.
but
there's
no
right,
and
there
was
nothing
to
force
the
company
to
extend
electric
service
except
within
the
bounds
of
its
term.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
once
--
once
we
have
hooked
somebody
else,
accepted
somebody
as
a
customer,
there's
a
statutory
obligation
for
reasonably
continuous
service,
i
think
it
is.
that
is
correct.
now
that
obligation,
however,
is
subject
determination
if
when
we
supply
service,
we
have
not
been
paid
for
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
state
can
only
order
as
to
supply
electricity
within
the
context
of
the
rights
of
the
utilities.
it
cannot
order
us
to
supply
electricity
to
customers
and
receive
no
compensation
for
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
believe
that
the
public
service
commission
could
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
direct
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
as
long
as
we
have
an
opportunity
to
receive
payment.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
we
would
have
an
opportunity
to
build
before
the
commission
a
record
of
on
which
they
would
base
a
decision
as
to
any
deviation
from
our
present
practices.
i
believe
that
i've
given
you
our
position.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
do
think
it
is
important
to
the
case
to
take
just
a
minute
to
go
back
to
the
facts
and
whether
this
is
a
termination
case
or
not.
this
28-year
old
woman
bought
a
house
in
'69.
a
year
later,
her
electricity
was
terminated
for
nonpayment
of
bills.
45
minutes
later,
in
some
manner,
it
was
reconnected
and
thereafter,
bills
did
not
come
to
her.
it
came
to
a
man
who
was
staying
at
her
house.
a
year
following
that,
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
no.
the
only
witness
was
the
petitioner
and
she
says,
that
she
has
no
idea
how
it
came
about.
but
after
that,
and
for
a
period
of
13
months,
bills
came
to
a
man
staying
in
her
house.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
and
not
to
her
and
during
that
period,
she
made
no
effort
to
pay
the
bill
that
was
outstanding
for
the
service
prior
to
that
termination.
then,
an
employee
came
on
a
wednesday
looking
for
the
man
in
the
house
and
was
inform
that
he
had
left
some
month
and
a
half,
previously.
he
also
looked
at
the
meter.
the
next
day,
another
man
came
to
the
house
and
discussed
the
situation
with
the
petitioner
and
then,
it
must
had
have
some
discussion
about
who
the
customer
was
and
termination
and
all
of
that,
because
she
testifies
that
she
told
this
man
to
put
the
electric
service
in
the
name
of
robert
jackson
to
give
me
time
to
get
the
rest
of
the
money
to
pay
the
old
bill.
robert
jackson
was
her
12-year
old
son.
three
days
later,
a
man
came
and
disconnected
the
service.
she
then
telephoned
the
company
man
who
had
been
there
the
preceding
thursday,
found
he
was
not
in
the
office
but
he
had
left
word
for
her
to
be
given
his
home
number,
so
that
she
could
call
him
at
home
which
she
did.
he
then
told
her
according
to
her
testimony.
who
was
responsible
for
the
matter
now?
another
employee
of
the
company,
she
testified,
she
never
called
them.
now,
it's
our
position
under
those
facts
that
she
was
not
a
customer
who
was
terminated
nor
did
she
apply
for
service.
she
could
still
apply
for
service.
the
company
in
view
of
the
past
history
under
the
tariff
would
have
the
right
to
require
reasonable
deposit.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
that
is
her
testimony
and
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
and
it
is
uncontradicted.
and
if
it
was
$30.00
i'm
sure
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
no,
it
recognized
that
she
was
a
former
customer
as
counsel
with
an
outstanding
bill
of
over
a
hundred
dollars.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
there
is
nothing
at
this
time
in
here
on
the
100
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
no,
your
honor.
it
isn't
tied
together
in
that
fashion.
there
is
mentioned
of
the
$30.00.
there
is
her
straightforward
admission
that
she
still
owed
the
bill
that
was
over
a
year
old.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
believe
your
honor
that
it
was
not
--
there
was
a
discussion
about
new
service
that
had
to
be
because
she
testified.
she
said,
put
in
the
name
of
robert
jackson.
now,
in
that
conversation,
there
were
some
evidently
some
mentioned
of
$30.00.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
well,
your
honor,
maybe
it
would
be
a
help
if
i
took
just
a
minute
before
getting
the
state
action
to
tell
you
the
company's
procedures
in
regard
to
delinquent
accounts.
in
'73,
1973,
there
were
217,000
notices
of
delinquent
accounts
that
went
out.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
217,000.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it
isn't,
your
honor.
there
are
very
similar
figures
in
the
city
of
philadelphia's
brief.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
in
the
service
area
of
metropolitan
edison
which
includes
more
than
new
york.
it
includes
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
somewhat
less
than
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
don't
believe
we
do,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
now,
that
goes
out
after
30
days
after
the
bill,
and
when
no
response
is
heard
to
from
that,
and
there
129,000
such
cases,
those
cases
were
referred
to
the
credit
managers.
and
the
credit
managers
then
either
in
person,
as
in
this
case,
where
they
went
out
looking
for
the
customer
or
by
phone
or
by
mail,
try
to
contact
the
customer
and
there
were
in
1973
only
4,390
terminations.
there
was
not
a
procedure
whereby,
if
a
bill
is
not
immediately
paid,
the
switch
is
pulled.
similarly,
this
is
a
matter
in
which
the
public
has
tremendous
interest.
for
instance,
fortune
reported
in
september
that
in
march
of
1974,
when
four
went
its
dividend
of
28
million,
consolidated
edison
had
outstanding
bills
of
$367,151,000.00
with
an
average
life
of
59
days,
those
bills.
the
amount
of
the
dividend
forgone
was
$28
million.
it
lost
$24.5
million
in
uncollectible
accounts
in
1973.
so,
these
procedures
on
collection
are
extremely
important
to
the
public.
last
saturday,
the
papers
carried
the
account
of
the
tremendous
cut
back
in
electric
utility
construction
that
has
been
caused
a
gain
by
a
lack
of
cash
in
these
times
of
inflation.
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
state
action.
i
think
it's
maybe
posed
most
directly
by
the
california
amici
when
they
present
the
issue
that
state
action
is
present
where
a
significant
governmental
interest
are
promoted
by
a
pattern
of
regulation
delegating
state
power
to
a
extensively
private
persons
who
then
act
with
the
force
of
law.
that
is
similar
to
what
counsel
said
and
repeated
about
this
graft
of
monopoly
power.
it
didn't
work
that
way.
in
1913,
when
the
public
utility
law
of
pennsylvania
was
passed
and
the
set
forth
regulation
over
not
only
electric
utilities
but
of
course,
worth
companies,
grain
elevator
companies,
telephone
companies,
pipeline
corporations,
ferries
and
all
the
other
things.
met
ed
--
and
the
service
of
electricity
by
met
ed's
predecessors
had
been
going
on
for
a
substantial
time.
met
ed
is
still
subject
to
a
99-year
lease
under
then
to
1894
and
has
a
contract
in
perpetuity
with
the
town
of
middleton
to
sell
them
electricity
at
a
standard
kilowatt
hour
in
perpetuity
that
was
entered
into
in
1906.
so,
it
was
not
a
grant
of
state
power
that
resulted
in
the
regulated
utility
system
we
have
today.
instead,
it
was
a
recognition
that
many
businesses
are
affected
with
the
public
interest
and
the
desire
to
protect
consumer
--
consumer
led
to
their
regulation
that
being
true
in
justice
brandeis'
concurring
opinion
on
south
western
bell
and
goes
into
this
subjected
to
the
link.
that
being
true,
all
acts
of
a
public
utility
are
not
actions
of
the
state.
now,
where
the
state
has
particularly
ordered
the
electric
utility
to
do
something
and
the
utility
then
goes
out
under
color
of
not
order
and
does
something,
certainly,
that
would
be
a
type
of
action
that
would
receive
the
protection
with
that
the
petitioner
here
seeks.
on
the
other
hand,
the
filing
of
its
practices,
so
that
it's
customers
will
have
knowledge
of
its
practices.
practices
which
are
not
acted
on
by
the
state
with
the
tariff
being
filed
because
the
state
requires
you,
for
the
protection
of
your
customers,
to
let
your
customers
know
how
you're
going
to
operate?1
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
think
that
is
the
issue.
it's
whether
inaction
can
be
equated
with
action.
now,
i
have
no
question
that
an
electric
utility
operating
under
the
new
public
--
new
york
public
service
termination
procedures
would
then
be
acting
--
it
would
be
state
action.
but
where
there
has
been
no
action,
we
do
not
believe
it
should
be
extended.
it's
mentioned
in
the
briefs
that
vermont
instituted
termination
procedures.
last
week,
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
in
saying,
you
do
it
this
way.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it
accepted
a
for
filing,
i
believe
this
is
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
think
in
that
case,
that
the
company
acting
under
it
would
get
support
and
encouragement
from
state
action
and
a
suit
against
those
procedures
rely.
so
it's
strictly
a
question
of
whether
no
action
is
equivalent
to
this
type
of
approval.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
right,
but
then
the
utility
went
out
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
well,
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
well,
it
is
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
i
am
conceding
it,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
the
reasoning
behind
conceding
for
this
case
is
we
are
a
very
heavily
regulated
industry.
we
do
have
a
very
important
role
to
play.
we
do
take
our
orders
from
the
state,
the
state
courts,
the
federal
agencies,
this
court
and
we
try
to
do
things
correctly.
our
image
before
the
public
as
justice
brandeis
pointed
out
is
all
important.
we
have
only
one
way
of
making
money,
that's
to
sell
electricity.
we
don't
cut
anybody
off
unreasonably
if
we
can
help
it.
on
the
other
hand,
we
get
absolutely
no
assistance
from
any
state
or
governmental
agency
in
raising
the
funds
necessary
to
carry
on
this
business.
either
court
or
state
tells
us,
this
is
how
you
do
it.
once
we
have
exhausted
our
protection,
we
will
do
it
that
way.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
well,
that
--
that
to
me
is
not
action
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
misunderstood.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it
is.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
think
that
still
is
non-action,
justice
white.
excuse
me,
i
thought
that
they
were
directing
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
but
not
saying
that
this
is
the
way
you
have
to
do.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
right.
but,
excuse
me,
i
missed
the
innuendo.
and
in
vermont,
i
think
the
vermont
case
last
week
is
interesting.
the
supreme
court
reversed
the
public
utility
commission
where
they
have
set
up
procedures.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
unfortunately,
your
honor,
it
was
late
last
week
in
manhattan.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it's
a
court
decision.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it
is
the
rutland
herald
of
last
week,
your
honor,
reporting
the
motion
by
vermont
welfare
rights
organization
asking
the
supreme
court
to
reconsider
its
decision
voiding
the
policy
of
the
public
service
board
in
connection
with
termination
procedures.
and
the
only
reason
that
the
court
voided
was
because
the
public
service
commission
had
proceeded
without
any
factual
basis
in
the
record.
it
had
not
held
hearings
to
determine
the
circumstances
and
therefore
had
no
findings
in
support
of
their
order.
there's
no
question
that
the
public
service
commission
can
direct
these
things
after
hearings
like
the
new
york
public
service
commission's
stand.
that
is
the
utility's
protection.
if
they
are
told
to
do
something
this
way,
the
regulatory
agency
has
to
have
support
and
a
basis
because
the
utility
is
entitled
to
due
process
too.
so
in
this
case,
our
position
is
that
there
has
to
be
affirmative
action
directing.
then,
if
we
act
under
color
of
that
directive,
we
are
subjected.
in
connection
with
this
grant
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
in
the
case
that
i
can
visualize
at
the
moment,
justice
powell,
i
would,
yes.
i
mean,
if
it's
a
question
of
a
--
and
a
tariff,
once
accepted
or
approved,
your
description
of
service
is
in
there.
the
office
at
which
you
collect
your
bills
and
just
lots
and
lots
of
material
that
is
in
this
category
that
would
subject
to
change
by
filing
a
new
tariff
and
it
would
only
be
if
you
were
doing
something
unreasonable
that
a
commission
would
then
come
along
and
say,
you
must
change
the
tariff
and
do
it
this
way
and
then
i
say,
there
would
be
the
director.
so,
just
there,
acceptance
for
filing
or
approval,
i
would
if
they
could
not
act.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
exactly,
exactly,
in
all
of
the
regulated
businesses
and
there
are
very,
very
few
businesses
that
are
not
regulated
in
some
degree
today.
whether
there
are
corporations
or
individuals.
now,
i
believe,
i
covered
our
main
points
that
we
unfortunately
don't
believe
this
is
a
termination
case
because
the
petitioner
was
not
our
customer.
she
didn't
apply
for
new
service
herself,
so
it's
not
an
equal
protection
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
believe
that
there
is
no
right
to
receive
electric
service
except
under
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
there
is
a
statutory
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
without
--
exactly,
i
was
going
to
say
except
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
if
we
discriminate
it
against
her,
as
oppose
to
any
other
person
who
acquired
for
service,
i
believe
that
there
would
be
a
cause
under
the
equal
protect
clause
as
the
day
of
this
beware
case
was
holding
this
summer.
but
there's
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
excuse
me
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
there,
we
were
dealing
with
a
municipal
company.
but
there's
no
right,
and
there
was
nothing
to
force
the
company
to
extend
electric
service
except
within
the
bounds
of
its
term.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
once
--
once
we
have
hooked
somebody
else,
accepted
somebody
as
a
customer,
there's
a
statutory
obligation
for
reasonably
continuous
service,
i
think
it
is.
that
is
correct.
now
that
obligation,
however,
is
subject
determination
if
when
we
supply
service,
we
have
not
been
paid
for
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
state
can
only
order
as
to
supply
electricity
within
the
context
of
the
rights
of
the
utilities.
it
cannot
order
us
to
supply
electricity
to
customers
and
receive
no
compensation
for
it.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
believe
that
the
public
service
commission
could
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
direct
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
as
long
as
we
have
an
opportunity
to
receive
payment.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
we
would
have
an
opportunity
to
build
before
the
commission
a
record
of
on
which
they
would
base
a
decision
as
to
any
deviation
from
our
present
practices.
i
believe
that
i've
given
you
our
position.
