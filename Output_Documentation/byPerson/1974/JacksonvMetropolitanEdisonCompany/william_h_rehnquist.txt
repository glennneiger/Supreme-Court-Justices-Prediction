the

it?

justice
william

so,
it's

cutting

well,
that's
really
a

argument
than
you
make
in

isn't

if

in

and
follow
it
through
the

in

you're

was
there
any

what

justice
william

is
this
in
the

mr.
debevoise?
justice
william

rehnquist
first,
the
petitioner
contends,
i
guess
that
the
inaction
of
the
commission
after
the
filing
was
tantamount
to
affirmative
approval.
justice
william

do
you
feel

by
the

in

of

that

what

what

him

whether

justice
william

then
schools
you're
talking
about
a
government
official
by
definition

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
arises
out
of
respondent
metropolitan
edison's
termination
of
electrical
service
to
the
residence
of
catherine
jackson,
the
petitioner,
for
alleged
non-payment
of
bills
for
prior
utility
service.
metropolitan
is
a
privately
owned
company
licensed
and
regulated
by
the
pennsylvania
public
utilities
commission.
its
action
in
terminating
petitioner's
utility
service
was
permitted
by
a
provision
of
its
general
tariff
which
had
been
filed
with
the
state
utilities
commission.
petitioner
brought
suit
against
metropolitan
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania
seeking
damages
and
injunction
requiring
metropolitan
to
continue
providing
service
until
she
had
received
a
hearing
and
an
opportunity
to
pay
the
amounts
found
due.
petitioner
argued
that
she
had
an
entitlement
to
electric
service
under
a
pennsylvania
statute
which
constituted
property
under
the
due
process
clause.
and
that
metropolitan's
termination
had
deprived
her
of
this
entitlement
without
minimum
procedural
protections
required
by
that
portion
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
she
further
argues
that
metropolitan's
termination
was
state
action
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
district
court
dismissed
her
complaint
and
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
this
judgment.
our
cases
from
the
civil
rights
cases
of
1883
forward
have
recognized
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
opens
to
judicial
scrutiny
only
in
state
action
and
not
private
action.
the
threshold
question
in
this
case
is
whether
metropolitan's
action
in
terminating
service
was
sufficiently
closely
connected
to
the
state
of
pennsylvania
to
be
fairly
attributable
to
that
state
for
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
hold
that
is
not.
under
our
decisions,
the
partial
monopoly
status
of
metropolitan
and
the
fact
that
it
is
subject
to
state
regulation
do
not
create
a
sufficient
nexus
between
the
state
and
the
termination
to
make
the
termination
state
action.
the
provision
of
electrical
services
also
is
not
traditionally
exclusive
state
function.
respondent's
exercise
of
the
choice
allowed
by
state
law
in
this
case
where
the
initiative
comes
from
it
and
not
from
the
state
does
not
make
its
action
that
of
the
state
for
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
taking
all
of
petitioner's
arguments
together
we
find
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
is
not
sufficiently
connected
with
the
termination
so
as
to
make
its
action
state
action.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
therefore
affirmed.
mr.
justice
douglas,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
each
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion
in
the
case.
