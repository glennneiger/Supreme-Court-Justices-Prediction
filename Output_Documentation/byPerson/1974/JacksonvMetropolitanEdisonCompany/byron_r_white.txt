justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
--
i
would
suppose,
you
would
have
objected
if
the
--
under
the
temporary
restraining
order,
the
court
could
have
ordered
to
pay
currently
quite
for
her
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
the
only
thing
at
issue
is
$30.00,
do
you
concede
the
--
that
if
the
company
was
to
continue
service,
there
should
be
current
payment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
if
it's
found
--
if
it's
found
that
that
she
really
doesn't
know
that
$30.00
if
she
goes
ahead
and
pays
it
as
the
odds
are
she's
going
to
get
it
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
there's
no
risk
of
loss
on
her
part
and
the
real
question
is
whether
$30.00,
whether
it‘s
without
notice
or
anything,
without
a
hearing,
she
should
be
required
to
put
up
$30.00
pending
a
hearing
on
the
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
understand
that.
was
she
was
willing
to
pay
the
--
to
put
up
the
$30.00
and
litigate
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest,
you
don't
suggest
that
the
company
would
have
turn
it
off
if
she
have
paid
for
$30.00
and
told
them,
“look,
i
don't
know
that
$30.00
and
i'm
going
to
try
to
get
it
back,
huh!”
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
get
it
clear.
do
you
say
that
if
the
due
process
clause
that
had
been
satisfied
if
the
company
said,
“look,
pay
us
by
monday
or
we're
going
to
turn
your
power
off.”
and
she
said,
“well,
i
don't
pay
monday
and
the
only
thing
is
i'm
going
to
litigate
with
it
and
try
to
get
it
back.”
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
do
you
agree
that
the
$30.00
is
all
that's
at
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
you
concede
mr.
greenberg
that
she
had
to
pay
currently?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
alright.
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
the
--
of
her
own
past
due
bill?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
$30.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'll
put
it
to
you
again.
the
only
thing
at
issue
is
her
back
--
is
her
past
due
bills.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whether
or
not
she
is
fair
to
say,
you
put
up
the
money
now
and
we'll
keep
your
power
going.
that's
really
the
only
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
she's
finally
getting
her
money
back
if
she
wins.
justice
byron
r.
white
before
paying
$30.00
or
before
paying
the
bills?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
mr.
greenberg
but
the
question
is
who
has
to
take
the
risk?
justice
byron
r.
white
whose
money
is
going
to
be
up
meanwhile?
justice
byron
r.
white
who's
losing
it
if
he's
talking
about
meanwhile.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
your
submission.
i
just
want
to
know
what
really
the
risk
is
to
her.
risk
is
to
her
is
that
--is
that
she
really
doesn't
have
the
$30.00
to
put
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
she
had
the
$30.00
to
put
up,
why
she
--
she
put
and
the
power
would
stay
on
and
if
she
wins,
she'd
get
it
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
take
it,
there's
no
issue
that
the
hearing
available
sometime
in
real
place.
it
is
whether
the
before
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
put
up
the
$30.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
burden
on
her
is
having
to
put
up
$30.00
pending
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
greenberg,
whatever
the
sum
is,
that's
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
burden
on
her
of
having
to
put
up
what
her
unpaid
bill
is
pending
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
say
yes.
i
mean,
that
certainly
get
to
the
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
even
makes
--
that
even
makes
my
question
more
an
element.
the
only
asked
her
for
$30.00.
the
only
issue
--
the
only
burden
on
her
then
was
putting
up
the
$30.00
pending
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
due
process
clause
doesn't
require
a
hearing.
i'm
just
trying
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
put
all
the
burdens
on
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
we
shouldn't
look
this
case
as
the
one
involved
--
this
necessity
of
putting
up
$30.00
pending
litigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
when
you
cut
off
the
same
way
though,
it
was
only
$30.00,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
record
show
why
not
change
in
billing
occurred?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
notices
went
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
that
you
stated
if
the
commission
had
entered
an
affirmative
order
of
proving
the
tariff.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
no,
it
didn't
say,
you
do
it
this
way
just
to
prove
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
let's
assume
they
had
entered
an
order
of
proving.
let's
assume
there
had
been
litigation
--
to
say
that
tariff
had
been
a
tax
and
the
--
a
tax
entered
strictly
on
the
rule
and
the
commission
said,
this
is
quite
illegal
under
state
law
and
we
have
proven,
we
have
no
grounds
to
discipline
them
and
we
have
proof.
justice
byron
r.
white
submission
turns
the
power
off
without
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
issue
is
whether
the
act
of
turning
the
power
off
without
a
hearing
is
action
of
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
it
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
right
therefore
my
examples
simply
meant
that
if
the
court
--
if
they
make
--
if
they
filed
a
tariff
and
there
is
litigation
of
--
about
the
validity
of
the
termination
rule
and
the
commission
says,
this
is
perfectly
consistent
with
state
law.
we
don't
require
you
to
do
it
this
way
but
you
may.
we
approve
the
tariff.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
just
to
prove
it,
but
they
did
it,
but
there
was
affirmative
proof
of
the
tariff.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
file
another
tariff,
you
wanted
to.
and
of
course,
they
say
which
is
now
that
you
have
filed
it,
you
must
follow
it.
i
mean,
that's
what
a
tariff
is,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
otherwise,
any
private
act
is
consistent
with
state
law
and
then
in
one
sense
would
have
the
approval
of
state
law
would
be
state
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
not
a
statutory
obligation
for
the
companies
that
take
part
in
the
electricity
--
justice
byron
r.
white
without
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
a
--
alright,
but
if
a
person
is
willing
to
leave
up
to
the
rules
of
the
company
without
this
tariff,
there's
a
statutory
obligation
to
furnish
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
saying
that
a
state
may
order
a
company
to
furnish
electricity.
and
the
company
can
go
ahead
then
the
hearing
out
of
statutory
obligation
to
furnish
electricity
and
then
the
state
may
permit
that
--
may
permit
the
termination
without
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
could,
i
suppose,
in
order
to
get
a
hearing
before
a
termination.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
they
wouldn't
made
--
they
wouldn't
be
violating
any
rights
of
yours
if
they
ordered
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
the
--
the
utility
refused
to
furnish
electricity
in
negroes
that
it
could
be
sued
for
damages
under
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
because?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
action
but
the
question
is
whether
the
state
denied
equal
protection
of
law,
that's
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
state
had
been
denied
protection
of
the
law.
is
it
just
in
state
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
never
indicated
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
state
said
to
serve
everybody
equally
and
this
company
disobeys
the
statute
and
refuses
to
serve
negroes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
the
meter
reader
beat
up
the
householder
liable
to
1983.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
contrary
to
tariff.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
meter
reader
is
agent
of
the
state
in
your
book?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
argument
in
this
clause
it
would
be
through
even
if
he
was
ordered
not
to
and
he
nevertheless
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
--
i
would
suppose,
you
would
have
objected
if
the

under
the
temporary
restraining
order,
the
court
could
have
ordered
to
pay
currently
quite
for
her
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
the
only
thing
at
issue
is
$30.00,
do
you
concede
the
--
that
if
the
company
was
to
continue
service,
there
should
be
current
payment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
if
it's
found
--
if
it's
found
that
that
she
really
doesn't
know
that
$30.00
if
she
goes
ahead
and
pays
it
as
the
odds
are
she's
going
to
get
it
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
there's
no
risk
of
loss
on
her
part
and
the
real
question
is
whether
$30.00,
whether
it‘s
without
notice
or
anything,
without
a
hearing,
she
should
be
required
to
put
up
$30.00
pending
a
hearing
on
the
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
understand
that.
was
she
was
willing
to
pay
the
--
to
put
up
the
$30.00
and
litigate
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest,
you
don't
suggest
that
the
company
would
have
turn
it
off

paid
for
$30.00
and
told
them,
“look,

$30.00
and
i'm
going

back,
huh!”
justice

let
me
get
it
clear.
do
you
say
that
if
the
due

clause
that
had
been
satisfied
if
the
company
said,
“look,
pay
us
by

and
she

is
i'm
going
to
litigate
with
it

justice
byron

white
alright.
do
you
agree
that
the
$30.00
is
all
that's
at
issue?
justice
byron

white
--
but
you
concede
mr.
greenberg
that
she
had
to
pay
currently?
justice
byron

white
well,
alright.
now
--
justice
byron

white
you
mean,
the
--
of
her
own
past

justice
byron

white
not
the
$30.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'll
put
it
to
you
again.
the
only
thing
at

is
her
back

is
her
past

justice

and
whether
or
not
she
is
fair
to
say,
you
put
up
the

now
and
we'll
keep
your

going.
that's
really
the
only

getting
her

just
want
to
know
what

is
that

that

if
