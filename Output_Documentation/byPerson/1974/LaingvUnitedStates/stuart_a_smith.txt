mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
cases
which
have
been
consolidated
come
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
and
second
circuits.
they
present
a
procedural
issue
under
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954
that
is
whether
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
is
required
to
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
connection
with
his
termination
of
a
taxpayer's
taxable
year
pursuant
to
that
authority
granted
him
by
section
6851
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
divided
on
this
question
with
the
second
circuit
in
the
laing
case
holding
that
the
commissioner
is
not
so
required
to
issue
a
notice
and
the
sixth
circuit
holding
that
the
commissioner
is
required
to
issue
such
a
notice.
in
our
view,
the
sixth
circuit
in
imposing
such
a
requirement
on
the
commissioner
has
erroneously
merged
two
different
statutory
provisions
of
the
code,
determination
provision
section
6851
and
an
early
assessment
provision
which
is
presently
set
out
in
section
6861
of
the
code.
the
significance
of
the
way
this
case
has
arise
and
the
significance
of
the
issue
for
purposes
of
these
cases
is
that
if
the
commissioner
is
not
so
required
to
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
connection
with
a
termination
case
as
we
submit.
the
parties
have
agreed
that
these
suits
are
barred
by
the
anti-injunction
act,
a
long-standing
statute
which
congress
enacted
over
a
hundred
years
ago
which
prohibits
suits
to
enjoin
the
collection
and
assessment
of
taxes
by
any
person
in
any
court.
at
the
outset,
i
think
it
important
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
with
an
explicit
exception
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
scope
of
that
exception
is
that
issue
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
record
does
not
show
how
the
figure
was
arrived
at
but
perhaps
i
can
help
the
court
with
that.
apparently
what
was
done
was
taxpayer,
that
is
laing
and
his
two
companions
were
subjected
to
a
net
worth
plus
non-deductible
expenditures
computation.
that
is
they
were
asked
as
to
--
laing
was
asked
as
to
how
long
he
was
in
the
united
states.
it
turned
out
to
be
some
20
or
30
days.
the
district
director
then
made
a
computation
based
on
his
living
expenses
for
that
period.
in
turn
the
value
of
the
cash
on
the
person's
was
also
included
as
part
of
the
net
worth
and
an
income
figure
was
arrived
at
the
sum
i
think
$315,000.00
or
so.
there
was
also
a
quantity
of
a
hashish
found
on
the
person
of
laing
which
was
valued
at
a
certain
retail
value
and
once
that
an
income,
of
course
income
figure
was
arrived
at,
then
the
internal
revenue
service
gave
each
taxpayer,
each
person
in
the
car
credit
for
the
standard
deduction
and
a
personal
exemption
and
then
a
resulting
taxable
income
figure
was
arrived
at
upon
which
the
tax
is
computed.
it
turned
out
to
be
something
like
$195,000.00.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i
shall
and
i
will
be
glad
to
elaborate
on
that
also
that
the
record
with
similarly
silent.
now,
the
assessments
were
then
made
in
the
amount
of
$195,000.00.
now,
laing
and
his
two
companions
refused
to
pay
this
tax
so
once
having
an
assessment,
the
commissioner
exercised
his
collection
powers
which
are
also
well
settled
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
section
6331
provides
for
levy
and
restraint
power
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
and
as
a
result
since
the
tangible
property
that
is
the
cash
was
available,
the
internal
revenue
service
levied
upon
this
cash
that
was
found
hidden
in
the
engine
compartment
in
the
suitcase.
now,
three
or
four
months
later
then,
laing
commenced
this
action.
in
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
district
of
vermont
seeking
to
enjoin
the
commissioner's
assessment
and
collection
of
these
taxes
and
prohibiting
his
continued
possession
of
his
money.
now,
the
government
defended
this
suit
on
the
grounds
of
the
anti-injunction
act
which
prohibits
this
kind
of
injunctive
suits
for
assessment
of
collection
of
taxes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no
the
--
yes,
the
relief
he
has
sought
was
to
enjoin
the
services
continued
possession
of
this
money
and
to
return
it
to
him.
there
was
no
attempt
to
--
although
some
of
this
case
has
involve
that
kind
of
relief,
these
cases
involve
simply
a
question
of
you
know,
the
relief
sought
by
the
taxpayer
is
to
prohibit
the
continued
possession
by
the
internal
revenue
service
of
the
money
levied
upon.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
because
--
yes,
and
the
ground
that
the
taxpayers
urge
is
that
the
commissioner
has
not
issued
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
this
case
then
the
anti-injunction
act
does
not
apply.
now
the
district
court
in
laing
dismissed
the
taxpayer's
action
and
on
an
appeal
to
the
second
circuit
that
court
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
its
previous
decision
in
the
irving
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that's
correct.
i
mean
that's
what
the
statute
that
--
once
you
have
a
jeopardy
assessment
with
the
respect
to
a
full
taxable
year
which
we
submit
involves
an
entirely
different
statutory
provision.
section
6861
(b)
provides
that
the
commissioner
shall
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
within
60
days
with
the
making
of
the
assessment
if
he
hasn't
already
done
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
the
best
way
to
answer
that
question
is
to
simply
say
that
the
government
has
taken
the
position
in
these
cases
that
congress
has
made
a
decision
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
need
not
issue
a
deficiency
notice
in
connection
with
a
termination
of
a
taxable
year
simply
because
congress
has
made
the
other
decision
in
allocating
the
jurisdiction
of
the
various
courts
which
hear
a
tax
dispute
that
the
tax
court
is
not
empowered
to
hear
suits
involving
terminations
of
taxable
years.
i
think
the
commissioner
has
preceded
on
that
basis
since
this
termination
statute
was
enacted
in
revenue
act
of
1918
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
petition
in
the
hall
case
there
is
some
70
cases
now
pending
in
the
courts
and
an
additional
hundred
of
cases
now
pending
administratively
which
involved
this
issue
where
the
commissioner
has
taken
the
consistent
position
that
he
need
not
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
and
i
suppose
that
the
government
would
be
heard
in
the
sense
that
those
assessments
the
validity
and
propriety
of
those
assessments
would
be
put
at
issue
if
the
commissioner
was
deemed
to
have
to
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency.
and
all
the
commissioner
is
saying
here
is
that,
it
has
filed
what
it
thinks
--
he
has
filed
what
he
thinks
is
the
congressional
decision
then
he
need
not
issue
such
a
notice
of
deficiency.
i
think
that
the
point
is
here
that
the
review
in
the
tax
court
of
these
kinds
of
termination
actions
does
not
particularly
disadvantaged
taxpayers
while
some
of
the
courts
which
you
held
that
the
commissioner
must
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency,
i
think
were
prompted
by
what
they
thought
was
serious
questions
of
unfairness
by
not
providing
immediate
access
to
the
tax
court
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
commissioner's
position
raises
the
constitutional
issue,
although
i
think
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
not
only
do
we
think
that
the
statutory
history
demonstrates
the
existence
of
that
kind
of
congressional
decision
to
allocate
jurisdiction
in
the
termination
case
not
to
the
tax
court
but
to
the
district
courts
but
that
in
fact
the
constitution
--
that
decision,
that
congressional
decision
doesn't
pose
any
serious
constitutional
problems
because
of
the
existence
of
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
district
court.
now
the
--
so
the
second
circuit
has
held
that
the
government
is
correct
in
its
contention
that
the
commissioner
need
not
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
connection
with
this
termination
cases.
now,
the
facts
on
the
hall
case
are
relatively
parallel.
what
happened
to
the
taxpayer
in
the
hall
case
was
that
she
was
arrested
by
the
kentucky
state
police
and
charged
with
narcotics
--
charged
with
being
involved
in
the
sale
of
illegal
narcotics.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
what
the
taxpayer
must
do
before
he
can
assert
a
remedy
in
the
district
court
is
to
file
a
claim
for
refund.
that's
what
the
code
provides
because
presumably
the
commissioner
should
have
an
opportunity
administratively
to
be
able
to
determine
the
validity
of
the
claim.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
refund
claim
can
operate
on
the
amount
levied
upon
in
both
these
cases.
now
once
the
tax
--
once
the
commissioner
--
the
code
provides
that
the
commissioner
has
six
months
to
process
such
a
claim.
he
doesn't
process
such
a
claim
in
six
months,
he
can
bring
a
suit
in
the
district
court
often
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
six-month
period
is
foreshortened
by
informal
means.
for
example,
laing
after
the
close
of
the
taxable
year
brought
a
refund
suit
which
he
filed
on
march
1,
1973.
he
was
denied
on
march
9,
1973
and
indeed
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
he
filed
a
claim
but
the
refund
claim
was
denied
by
the
district
director
on
march
9,
1973
only
eight
days
later.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
don't
think
it's
that
unusual
because
i
think
in
connection
i,
myself
have
had
experience
with
filing
refund
claims
on
behalf
taxpayers
where
when
it
becomes
clear
after
in
a
normal
case
where
you've
gone
through
the
ordered
process
and
its
services
taking
one
position
and
you're
taking
another.
in
fact
in
this
case
it
was
obvious
even
at
this
juncture
that
this
was
going
to
be
an
issue
that
was
ultimately
going
to
have
to
be
resolved
by
this
court
since
the
courts
of
appeals
had
split
on
the
question.
it
seemed
obvious
that
the
commissioner
was
going
to
deny
the
claim
and
in
those
circumstances
i
have,
on
many
occasions,
asked
that
the
claim
be
denied
promptly.
and
in
most
cases
the
service
is
perfectly
happy
to
do
that.
there
is
no
reason
to
keep
these
claims
that
is
obviously
going
to
deny
any
way
pending
for
the
six-month
period,
and
if
for
some
reason
the
six-month
period
is
consumed
then
the
taxpayer
can
bring
the
suit
on
the
day
after
the
six-month
period
expires.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
in
any
event
i
don't
think
that
the
six-month
period
poses
any
significant
constitutional
problems
and
i
think
the
court
in
the
philips
case,
justice
brandeis
simply
said
that
when
you
have
the
summary
collection
remedies
the
important
thing
is
that
the
taxpayer
have
an
opportunity
for
post
collection
review.
and
if
that
posed
collection
review
here
takes
place
after
six
months
you
know
that
is
an
administrative
decision
made
by
congress
that
the
service
should
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
be
able
to
appraise
the
validity
of
the
claim
or
claims
are
not
easy
to
handle
and
the
service
should
have
a
minimum
amount
of
time
to
handle
these
claims.
now
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true
although
again
we
don't
think
that
that
makes
any
difference
in
terms
of
her
remedy
or
she
could
have
still
filed
the
claim
for
refund
in
our
view
and
gone
to
the
district
court
and
indeed
that's
what
make
this
case
somewhat
curious
because
here
you
have
taxpayers,
who
in
their
briefs,
are
strenuously
arguing
that
they
have
been
denied
some
very
important
right
and
that
is
to
be
able
to
get
a
notice
of
deficiency
and
go
to
the
tax
court
but
the
tax
court
is
not
necessarily
a
particularly
favorable
form
for
the
adjudication
of
these
type
of
cases
if
what
the
taxpayers
are
concerned
with
is
speed,
because
it's
been
recently
estimated
that
it
takes
about
two
years
from
filing
a
petition
to
final
decision
to
litigate
a
case
in
the
tax
court.
the
tax
court
is
a
busy
form.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
is
an
argument
that
the
flora
case
would
bar
litigation
in
the
district
court
in
these
types
of
cases
with
respect
to
someone
in
mrs.
hall's
position.
we
think
that
argument
misreads
this
court
in
flora's
opinion.
what
this
court
held
in
flora
was
that
under
general
circumstances
a
taxpayer
cannot
bring
a
refund
suit
until
he
has
paid
the
full
amount
of
the
assessment.
in
reaching
that
decision,
the
court
painstakingly
went
through
the
legislative
history
in
connection
with
the
creation
of
board
of
tax
appeals
and
there
were
indications
going
both
ways
as
to
what
congress
really
intended
but
i
think
that
the
really
operative
portion
of
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
flora
was
the
fact
that
there
the
taxpayer
had
another
remedy.
he
could
have
gone
to
the
tax
court
and
that
made
all
the
difference
in
flora
because
essentially
you
have
a
situation
where
if
you
had
subjected
to
an
assessment
of
$100.00
and
you
want
to
pay
$2.00
and
go
to
the
district
court.
well
then
this
court
said
in
flora
“you
can't
do
that."
"you
have
to
pay
the
whole
$100.00.”
and
the
reason
the
court
said
that
in
flora
was
because
as
the
chief
justice
said
he
could
have
gone
to
the
tax
court
without
paying
a
single
cent
and
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
that
tax
court
review
convinced
the
court
that
if
they
had
held
to
the
contrary
in
flora
they
would
have
infringed
upon
the
pre-payment
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court
because
essentially
you'd
have
a
situation
where
you
could
split
the
course
of
action.
you
could
in
effect
litigate
the
refund
suit
of
$2.00
and
perhaps
litigate
the
$98.00
case
in
the
tax
court.
this
court
held
that
congress
didn't
want
to
split
those
courses
of
action
and
of
course
these
two
different
systems
that
is
refund
suits
and
tax
court
review
to
infringe
upon
each
other.
here
that
rationale
has
no
application
because
we
say
that
congress
has
made
a
conscious
decision
not
to
give
the
tax
court
jurisdiction
over
these
termination
cases.
once
that
is
accepted
as
we
think
the
statutory
history
demonstrates,
then
flora
is
no
bar
to
the
bringing
of
these
kinds
of
suits
whether
the
whole
amount
is
seized
or
not
in
the
district
court.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
about
the
tax
court
not
being
a
particular
--
this
taxpayers
have
complained
in
effect
that
they
have
been
frozen
out
of
the
tax
court
or
blocked
to
immediate
access
to
the
tax
court
but
given
the
two-year
time
that
it
takes
to
litigate
a
tax
case
in
a
tax
court,
it
seems
to
us
that
it
would
be
far
more
favorable
for
these
taxpayers
subject
to
terminations
to
bring
a
refund
suit
for
the
amount
seized
and
bringing
that
suit
in
the
district
court.
in
most
district
courts,
the
time
for
bringing
a
refund
suit
is
considerably
shorter
than
two
years.
i
think
that
is
quite
plain
with
respect
to
the
district
court
in
kentucky
and
certainly
it's
clear
with
respect
to
the
district
courts
in
vermont.
in
fact,
that
refund
suit
in
vermont
with
respect
to
laing
case
is
now
waiting
--
is
now
being
held
up
awaiting
the
decision
of
this
court.
in
effect
that
this
action
had
never
been
brought,
laing
would
have
had
long
ago
with
disposition
with
respect
to
the
propriety
of
his
refund
claim
in
the
district
court
in
vermont.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
speed
is
an
important
criterion
for
the
taxpayers
in
the
sense
that
their
assets
have
been
levied
upon
if
you
read
the
complaints
of
the
taxpayers
in
the
record
of
appendixes
laing
complains
that
money
was
taken
away
from
him
and
business
opportunities
were
lost.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
prompt
adjudication
of
his
claim
is
really
the
most
important
thing
that
he
wants
and
having
brought
this
action
to
enjoin
on
the
basis
of
the
so-called
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act
is
in
effect
delaying
what
we
think
is
this
most
meaningful
and
effective
remedy
and
that
is
a
refund
suit
in
the
district
court.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
it
is
a
congressional
decision.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
suppose
the
only
way
to
analogize
is
to
say
is
to
compare
it
to
the
congressional
decision
to
exclude
excise
tax
jurisdiction
from
the
tax
court.
it
is
hard
to
imagine
if
we
were
planning
a
new
kind
of
procedure
we
perhaps
would
say
the
tax
were
what
to
have
jurisdiction
of
excise
tax
cases.
but
congress
has
quite
plainly
said
that
court
is
only
to
have
jurisdiction
over
income
state
and
gift
taxes.
congress
could
have
decided
the
other
way
and
given
the
tax
code
jurisdiction
over
those
cases
once
having
decided
the
other
way,
the
commissioner
has
more
or
less
dealt
himself
bound
by
that
congressional
decisions
and
has
refrain
consistently
from
assuming
those
of
efficiency
with
respect
to
these
cases.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
i
don't
think
the
government
you
know
it
is
hard
to
imagine
how
you
know
the
government
would
be
prejudiced
other
than
the
fact
that
you
know
because
of
the
commissioner's
consistent
policy
perhaps
some
$100
million
of
assessments
that
we
point
out
in
our
petition
and
the
hall
case
would
be
endangered.
i
think
that
is
a
significant
prejudice
to
the
commissioner
operating
under
a
fair
reading
of
these
statutes
that
he
was
not
so
required
to
issue
a
notice
of
efficiency.
i
mean,
i
suppose
the
answer
also
lies
in
what
we
are
talking
about
here
when
we
are
talking
about
people
who
turn
up
subject
to
these
terminations.
these
are
not
normal
taxpayers
these
are
people
who
are
committing
some
act
that
the
commissioner
believes
will
tend
to
defeat
the
collection
of
their
future
tax
law
ability.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
words
of
section
6851
it
says
that
if
the
secretary
finds
that
a
taxpayer
designs
quickly
to
depart
from
the
united
states,
or
to
remove
his
property
therefrom,
or
to
conceal
him
self
or
his
property
therein,
or
to
do
any
other
act
tending
to
prejudice
or
to
rend
a
wholly
or
partly
in
effectual
preceding
to
collect
the
income
tax.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
it
is
in
the
sense
that
in
the
hall
case
you
have
a
taxpayer
who
would
respect
to
whom
the
commissioner
has
received
information
that
she
is
involved
in
illegal
clandestine
activities
of
an
income
producing
nature.
and
i
think
that
is
a
fair
assumption
that
people
who
are
involved
in
clandestine
income
producing
activities
which
are
illegal
often
do
not
report
the
income,
do
not
declare
the
income
from
on
their
income
tax
return
in
fact
in
this
particular
case
mrs.
hall
filed
a
fully
year
income
tax
return
reporting
a
gross
income
from
wages
of
$530.00
for
the
whole
year.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
it
would
and
you
see
i
think
that
mr.
justice
powell,
you're
concentrating
with
respect
to
the
laing
case
with
respect
to
the
statutory
language
about
intending
quickly
to
depart
and
that
indeed
is
an
important
part
of
this
statute.
in
fact
a
departing
aliens
who
leave
this
country
every
day
who
are
subject
to
u.s.
income
tax
have
their
taxably
use
terminated
that
is
a
normal
kind
of
thing.
they
have
to
secure
a
certificate
of
compliance
and
it
is
called
colloquially
sailing
permit,
they
must
and
the
commissioner
terminates
their
taxable
year.
but
the
statute
by
its
term
is
not
limited
to
alien
taxpayers
it
is
also
subject
to
domestic
taxpayers
as
well.
for
example,
in
the
irving
case
that
was
a
celebrated
case
where
clifford
irving
perpetrated
a
very
notable
hoax,
in
which
he
receive
some
$765,000.00
from
a
publishing
company
in
connection
whit
a
false
biography.
once
that
hoax
was
discovered,
the
internal
revenue
service,
like
your
case
of
a
burglar,
could
easily
come
to
the
conclusion
that
irving
was
not
going
to
pay
taxes
on
that
amount
of
money.
so
in
the
irving
case,
irving's
taxable
year
was
terminated
and
an
amount
was
assess
based
on
that
receipt
of
that
money
and
an
amount
was
levied
upon
and
the
second
circuit
rejected
irving's
claim
which
is
the
same
claim
of
the
taxpayers
make
in
these
cases
that
the
commissioner
must
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
with
respect
to
these
cases.
i
think
that
illegal
activity
raises
a
connotation
that
if
people
are
breaking
other
laws
in
the
clandestine
way,
i
think
it
is
a
fair
assumption
by
the
internal
revenues
to
assume
that
they
are
not
going
to
meet
their
tax
liability.
indeed
the
tax
--
are
tax
system
is
based
on
a
voluntary
disclosure
and
the
people
are
involved
in
illegal
activity.
it
is
a
fair
assumption
that
they're
not
going
to
meet
that
voluntary
obligation
and
those
circumstances
congress
has
given
the
commissioner
power
to
provide,
to
make
this
artificial
termination
of
a
taxable
year
because
instead
of
having
to
wait
until
the
following
april
15,
congress
has
said
to
the
commissioner
you
may
terminate
some
ones
taxable
year
and
collect
taxes
on
that
terminated
period.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
protection
of
the
revenue
is
not
at
issue
here
with
respect
to
whether
the
commissioner
should
or
should
not
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency,
i
do
not
think
that
is
in
dispute.
what
concerns
us
is
the
fact
that
congress
has
made
a
legislative
decision
back
in
the
revenue
act
of
19
--
which
is
evidence
in
the
revenue
act
of
1921
through
the
revenue
act
and
through
the
creation
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
that
the
tax
court
is
not
to
have
jurisdiction
over
these
termination
cases.
now
i
think
that,
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
that,
we
point
--
we
set
forth
in
great
detail
inour
brief
but
i
think
it
would
demonstrate
it
by
the
sequence
of
legislative
events
that
occurred
from
1918
through
the
revenue
act
of
1926.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i'm
not
definitely
sure
why
you
say
that
i
mean
once
the
--
once
a
refund
suit
is
brought
and
if
the
district
court
for
example
orders
that
the
taxpayers
entitled
to
a
refund
i
suppose
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
congress
is
made
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
you
mean
in
these
particular
cases?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
the
whole
point
is
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
win
his
case
by
raising
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
indeed,
indeed
that
so
and
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
we
think
that
--
we
think
essentially
that
the
service
has
failed,
you
know
it
is
a
legal
argument
in
the
sense
that
we
are
construing
statutes
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
what
will
happen
in
the
laing
case
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
i
am
not
so
sure
that
we'll
be
able
to
keep
the
money.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
okay,
well
i
suppose
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
for
example
one
of
the
ground
upon
which
the
decisions
holding
that
we
have
to
issue
a
notice
are
premised
on
merging
section
6861
into
section
6851.
section
6861
(b)
requires
the
commissioner
to
issue
a
notice
within
60
days
of
the
making
of
the
assessment.
i
suppose
the
taxpayer
could
urge
that
if
we
did
not
issue
it
within
60
days,
the
whole
assessment
is
invalid.
now
the
board
of
tax
appeals
in
a
case
called
jh
reese
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief,
i
think
it
is
on
15
bta,
has
held
when
the
commissioner
has
fails
to
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
connection
with
a
straight
jeopardy
assessment
not
a
termination
in
case
the
jeopardy
assessment
is
invalid.
now
i
think
that
in
that
sense
the
government
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
but
i
am
not
--
i
do
not
know
whether
the
statute
is
still
open
to
make
a
new
one
in
this
case
and
i
suppose
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suppose.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suppose
that
is
right
although
--
i
suppose
that
is
right
the
collection
of
the
revenue
prospectively,
although
again
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
retroactively
they
would
be
a
good
deal
of
revenue
loss
in
this
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
these
cases
because
of
the
operation
of
the
statutes
of
limitations
and
with
respect
to
when
we
were
supposed
to
issue
the
notice.
i
mean
it's
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
true
but
you
know,
when
did
this
--
when
did
this
occur,
this
occurred
in
1972
the
commissioner
normally
has
three
years
in
which
to
issue
an
assessment.
i
am
not
sure
after
the
termination
after
the
conclusion
of
this
case
whether
the
statute
would
still
be
open
but
in
any
event
i
think
that
we
are
on
sound
grounds
statutorily
for
taking
the
position
that
we
do
not
have
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
they
are.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
both
of
them
have
filed
returns.
i
can
tell
the
court
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
with
the
statute
of
limitations
still
operate
with
respect
to
jeopardy
assessments
i
am
not
--
i
really
don't
know
the
answer
as
to
whether
the
years
would
be
open
in
these
cases
but
there
is
a
significant
problem
as
to
if
we
the
service
should
be
subjected
to
the
issuance
of
notice
of
deficiency
i
think
that
would
be
a
lot
of
these
cases
backed
up
in
the
courts
would
the
revenue
would
be
endangered
with
respect
to
that
and
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
would
appear
so
although
i
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
a
notice
could
be
issue
tomorrow
mr.
justice
blackmun
but
of
course
the
pendency
of
this
case
makes
that
likelihood
you
know
impossible
because
commissioner
has
taken
the
position
that
his
statutory
construction
does
not
require
him
to
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
fact
the
tax
court
has
held
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
administrative
decision
although
you
know
it
is
a
consistent
decision
which
we
have
made
which
the
services
made
since
this
the
statute
has
been
enacted
in
1918
because
you
see
the
notice
of
deficiency
require
--
issuance
of
the
notice
of
deficiency
requirement
is
tied
to
the
jurisdictional
question
as
to
whether
the
tax
court
has
jurisdiction
in
these
cases.
we
say
that
congress
decided
not
to
give
the
tax
court
jurisdiction
in
these
cases
and
as
a
result,
the
notice
of
deficiency
requirement
that
is
which
is
been
termed
the
ticket
to
the
tax
court,
you
can
not
get
in
the
tax
court
with
out
a
notice
of
deficiency
has
no
application
in
this
case.
the
reason
we
say
that
is
as
follows:
this
termination
provision
existed
in
the
revenue
act
of
1918.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
it
is
more
--
i
think
it
is
more
complicated
than
that
i
am
not
sure
with
respect
to
these
cases
the
commissioner
can
--
whether
these
years
are
open
would
anymore.
but
even
more
importantly
the
tax
court
has
held
that
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
in
these
cases.
it
held
that
in
the
ludwig
littauer
case
in
37
bta
and
has
consistently
held
today.
now
i'm
not
sure
that
even
if
the
commissioner
issued
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
these
cases
the
taxpayer
would
be
able
to
get
in
to
the
tax
court
because
the
tax
court
itself
has
construed
the
statutes
in
accordance
with
our
position
that
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
in
these
termination
cases
i
suppose
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
there
is
nothing
to
loose
by
it
other
than
the
fact
that
our
posture
has
been
in
these
cases
and
we
think
it's
soundly
grounded
on
reading
of
the
statutory
history
that
we
need
not
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
and
i
think
the
reason
we
need
not
is
evidence
than
the
statutory
history.
you
have
first
this
termination
provision
came
in
the
revenue
act
of
1918.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
we're
not
even
authorized
in
the
sense
that
because
we're
only
authorize
to
do
that
in
a
case
where
the
tax
court
has
jurisdiction
and
what
i
suppose
i
would
be
a
meaningless
act
in
the
sense
the
tax
court
has
consistently
held
that
it
would
not
take
jurisdiction
of
the
case
involving
a
short
period
year
so
that
the
issuance
of
the
a
notice
deficiency
in
these
cases
would
not
give
the
taxpayers
in
these
termination
cases
any
added
advantage.
they
wouldn't
be
able
go
to
the
tax
court
and
in
our
view
they
should
pursue
the
remedy
that
congress
provided
for
them,
a
rapid
remedy
and
one
that
does
not
pose
in
our
view
any
constitutional
problems.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
that's
what
makes
this
controversy
a
strange
one
in
the
sense
that
we
have
these
taxpayers
here
mr.
chief
justice
who
are
vying
to
get
this,
you
know,
piece
of
paper
which
permits
then
entrance
to
the
tax
court
which
in
our
view
is
not
a
particularly
favorable
mode
of
obtaining
re-dress
in
this
case.
tax
court
generally
involves
a
long
and
lengthy
proceeding.
they
want
to
get
there
money
back
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
way
to
get
it
back
is
just
to
pursue
the
remedy
that
congress
has
provided
that
is
district
court
refund
suits.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don't
think
the
--
let
me
put
it
to
you
this
way
let
me
emphasize
one
part
of
that
question.
i
don't
think
that
taxpayers
wouldn't
be
particularly
benefited
in
these
cases.
they
have
brought
these
suits
based
on
the
statutory
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act
urging
that
they
are
entitled
to
go
in
to
the
tax
court,
but
that
is
not
a
particularly
favorable
mode
of
re-dress
in
these
cases.
i
suppose
if
the
world
would
not
come
to
an
end
if
these
cases
were
heard
in
the
tax
court
but
it
simply
our
position
is
that
as
a
statutory
matter,
congress
has
allocated
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court
and
the
district
court
in
a
particular
way.
and
that
termination
cases
are
not
allocated
to
the
tax
court.
that
court
is
a
creature
of
statute
and
it
doesn't
have
the
power.
i
suppose
the
tax
court
could
easily
take
the
position
based
upon
its
consistent
holdings
which
go
up
until
last
year
which
sort
of
based
on
the
ludwig
littauer
case
that
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
so
even
if
the
commissioner
would
to
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency,
the
tax
court
could
take
the
position
that
it
didn't
have
to
hear
these
cases
involving
assessments
for
terminated
is.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
money
would
still
be
in
the
hands
of
the
government
because
that
is
another
decision
that
congress
has
made.
that
would
respect
to
people
like
these
taxpayers
who
presumably,
the
commissioner
has
made
a
finding
that
they
have
taken
steps
to
defeat
the
collection
of
tax
affirmative
steps
during
the
taxable
year.
the
commissioner
has
made
a
finding
--
the
congress
has
decided
that
they
are
to
be
subjected
to
summary
collection
procedures,
and
while
the
litigation
proceeds
the
commissioner
is
entitled
to
keep
the
money
because
i
think
that
these
kind
of
taxpayers
that
congress
set
out
in
section
6851
are
not
people
who
are
expected
to
reliably
pay
their
tax
liability.
there
is
a
provision
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
excuse
me?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
the
likelihood
of
i
don't
know
what
the
likelihood
of
her
getting
a
bond
would
be
but
the
point
is
that
she
has
brought
these
suit
mr.
justice
powell,
to
enjoin
the
commissioner's
action.
i
suppose
that
she
is
expended
funds
in
connection
with
these
suit
and
we
would
think
that
if
she
had
channeled
her
litigation
energies
toward
the
right
remedy
she
would
have
had
this
--
she
would
be
well
on
her
way
to
a
disposition
in
these
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly
she
doesn't
have
to
pay
$52,000.00
to
get
into
court
as
in
my
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
and
we
point
it
out
in
our
brief,
we
don't'
think
that
the,
you
know,
the
flora
bar
applies
here.
now
the
courts
that
have
held
against
us
that
is
the
sixth
circuit
in
these
case.
the
fifth
circuit
in
clark
versus
campbell
and
the
shrek
case
which
the
district
court
of
maryland
which
more
or
less
started
with
the
first
decision
on
this
issue
have
made
quite
a
good
deal
about
the
fact
that
flora
would
bar
this
such
a
refund.
so
we
don't
think
it
would.
we
don't
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
this
court
flora
decision
yield
such
a
result
and
the
second
circuit
has
held
flora
hasn't
what
wouldn't
bar
such
a
suit
in
both
in
the
irving
case
and
presumably
in
this
case
too,
because
the
second
circuit
in
this
case
said
she
could
bring
a
refund
suit
at
any
time.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
wouldn't
mind
if
the
court
said
so,
no
not
at
all.
i
don't
think
the
commissioner
would
mind
either.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
it
would
--
without
attempting
to
classify
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
both
beneficent
for
both
the
commissioner's
point
of
view
in
the
tax
court
point
of
view.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suppose
it
would
if
the
court
held
here
as
we
urge
that
the
tax
court
has
no
jurisdiction
in
these
cases
and
concomitantly,
i
think
it
concomitantly
would
have
to
reach
the
question
as
to
bar
of
flora
because
the
bar
of
flora
is
a
significant
bar.
if
you
can't
get
to
the
district
court
with
respect
to
if
you
don't
pay
the
whole
thing,
then
i
think
that
the
taxpayers
here
have
a
significant
problem
because
in
effect
they
are
barred
for
quite
a
long
time.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed
and
i
don't
think
that
the
code,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
since
we're
right
on
this
statutory
question
and
the
interpretation
of
flora,
i
think
the
constitutional
question
vanishes.
quite
frankly
and
i
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
indeed,
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
is
right
mr.
justice
white.
well
indeed
and
i
think
it
is
important
point
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
think
that
the
courts
that
have
held
against
us
have
acknowledged.
i
think
judge
kaufman's
opinion
in
shrek
which
we
think
erroneous
because
we
don't
think
that
it
focuses
on
the
statutory
history
in
this
case.
we
think
that
it
has
overlooked
the
revenue
act
of
1921
which
more
or
less
introduce
the
jeopardy
assessment
provision
in
to
the
code
as
an
exemption
to
the
administrative
appeal
procedure
which
later
became
the
tax
court,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court.
i
think
judge
kaufman
acknowledged
in
this
case
that
the
statutory
questions
were
close
and
that
you
can
read
them
either
way.
but
what
prompted
his
concern
and
which
prompted
the
results
he
reached
in
this
case
that
is
holding
that
the
commissioner
is
required
to
issue
such
a
notice
is
what
he
thought
was
significant
constitutional
questions.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
history
with
the
point
of
view
in
mind
as
to
how
the
sequence
develop
and
how
the
tax
court
is
not
a
forum
which
is
mandated
by
the
constitution.
congress
has
made
a
decision
that
the
tax
court
has
jurisdiction
over
certain
cases
and
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
claims
have
jurisdiction
to
resolve
other
kinds
of
tax
cases.
and
if
these
cases
can
go
to
the
district
court
as
we
submit
i
think
judge
kaufman's
concerns
and
i
think
the
concerns
of
judge
brown
articulated
in
the
clark
versus
campbell
opinion
which
this
court
is
holding
on
our
petition
vanish.
once
you
recognize
that
the
taxpayers
can
go
in
the
district
court
to
this
rapid
remedy
of
a
refund
suit
i
don't
think
that
there
are
any
significant
constitutional
problems.
my
remaining
time
i
would
like
to
talk
a
little
bit
about
this
statutory
history
because
i
think
that
it
sheds
important
light
on
the
congressional
decision
not
to
give
the
tax
court
jurisdiction
over
these
cases.
now
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes
perhaps
i
would
have
just
briefly
tell
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
the
court
as
to
the
basis
to
be
assessment
in
the
hall
case.
now
with
respect
to
mrs.
hall,
the
commissioner
terminated
her
taxable
year
as
of
the
end
of
january
1973.
now
the
–-
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it's
just
one
month
and
the
assessment
figures
were
based
upon
confidential,
reliable
informants
but
from
the
presumably
the
local
law
enforcement
officers
that
mrs.
hall
was
involved
in
the
sale
of
illegal
drug
substances
and
the
volume
of
that
was
also
communicated
to
the
internal
revenue
service
based
on
that
volume
on
the
daily
or
presumably
daily
business,
the
internal
revenue
service
reached
a
gross
income
configure,
i
suppose
if
something
like
over
a
hundred
thousand
dollars.
if
you're
going
to
be
wind
up
with
the
$52,000.00
tax
liability
then
gave
her
credit
for
the
personal
exemption
and
for
the
standard
deduction
and
then
restate
$52,000.00
figure.
i
think
that
will
be
the
record
doesn't
reflect
that
my
information,
well
i
have
been
advised
by
the
services,
that's
how
they
reach
this
result.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
value
of
her
property
was
more
by
comparison
that
$52,000.00
figure
it
was
i
think
a
bank
account.
i
think
also
a
safe
deposit
box
of
a
few
thousand
dollars
was
also
levied
upon.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
a
volkswagen
automobile
yes,
although
the
district
court
ordered
the
return
of
that
car
i
think
on
a
preliminary
injunction
immediately,
but
that's
how
that's
how
the
facts
arise
in
those
cases.
well,
let
me
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
was
all
her
discoverable
property
yes,
that's
correct
or
at
least
that's
all
that
the
internal
revenue
service
could
discover
as
of
the
time
they
made
this
assessment
and
i'm
not
aware
than
the
other
property
that
they've
been
able
to
discover.
well
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
statutory
history
in
these
cases
because
i
think
that
they
shed
important
ride
on
this
question.
you
see
the
courts
that
have
held
against
us
in
these
cases
and
imposed
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
deficiency
have
in
our
view
impermissibly
merged
two
different
statutory
provisions
that
is
determination
provision
and
the
early
assessment
provision
of
section
6861.
we
don't
think
that
they
can
be
merged,
we
think
that
the
statutory
history
in
the
case
that
they're
separate
and
distinct
provisions
which
stand
by
themselves
in
the
code.
indeed,
the
fact
that
they
came
in
at
different
times,
we
think
suggest
that
are
separate.
the
termination
provision
is
the
older
provision
it
came
in,
in
the
revenue
acted
of
1918.
now
from
1918
to
1921
there
was
no
early
assessment
provision.
so
congress
had
just
given
the
commissioner
power
to
make
terminations
of
taxable
use
of
people
who
were
engage
in
tax
avoidance
activities
for
that
current
year.
now
in
1921,
congress
decided
to
established
and
administrative
appeal
procedure.
now
that
administrator
appeal
procedure
was
new
and
what
essentially
said
was
because
before
the
commissioner
would
simply
make
an
assessment
and
then
collect
the
part
of
the
taxpayer
didn't
pay
he
had
to
he
was
levied
upon
and
then
how
to
suit
for
refund.
but
in
1921
the
commissioner
decided
to
set
up
a
procedure
whereby
the
taxpayers
claim
that
is
that
he
didn't
know
the
disputed
amount,
could
be
of
adhere
at
least
administratively.
so
it
set
up
this
procedure
we
abide
the
commissioner
would
have
to
issue
a
notice
to
the
taxpayer
and
the
taxpayer
then
would
have
30
days
in
which
the
file
protest
or
some
statement
of
his
position
and
then
that
administrative
appeal
would
be
invoked.
now
congress
also
determined
that
while
this
administrative
appeal
was
to
be
invoked,
the
commissioner
was
not
permitted
to
make
an
assessment
or
collect
the
taxes
at
issue
but
because
of
this
administrative
appeal
procedure,
congress
realized
that
there
would
be
cases
in
which
the
delay
of
the
administrative
appeal
would
produce
a
danger
to
the
revenue
and
that
perhaps
the
taxpayer
assets
might
be
wasted
or
they
might
be
competing
creditors
or
waiting
in
the
wings,
so
congress
authorized
in
a
proviso.
and
i
think
that
proviso
was
important
we
set
it
out
at
pages
70
and
71
of
our
appendix
(b)
to
our
brief.
proviso,
which
is
sort
of
at
the
end
to
first
paragraph
on
page
71
says
“provided
that
in
cases
where
the
commissioner
believes
that
the
collection
of
the
amount
due
will
be
jeopardized
by
such
delay.
he
may
make
the
assessment
without
giving
such
notice
or
awaiting
the
conclusion
of
such
hearing.”
now
this
is
the
statutory
predecessor
of
section
6861.
it
came
into
the
code
only
to
provide
a
means
for
the
commissioner
to
have
means
of
collection
wildly
administrative
appeal
procedure
was
invoked.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
determination
provision.
now
it's
important
for
the
court
to
remember
that
once
the
commissioner
terminates
somebody's
taxable
year
that
termination
does
not
--
that
statute
that
is
6851,
does
not
provide
the
commission
with
any
assessment
authority.
that
assessment
authority
derives
from
the
general
assessment
authority
of
section
6201
of
the
code
which
is
set
forth
in
our
appendix
(a)
of
our
brief
on
page
53.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
a
very
old
statute
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
not
exactly
sure
when
it
came
in
but
it
came
in
at
probably
at
the
beginning
of
the
time
when
the
internal
--
when
the
treasury
was
empowered,
when
taxes
began.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh!
much
before
1918,
in
fact
i
know
that
it
derives
at
least
from
section
3226
of
the
revised
statutes,
which
i
think
you
know
or
that's
about
1866
i
think,
but
i
think
it
probably
even
you
know
has
roots,
historical
roots
before
that.
so
essentially
you
have
these
two
provisions
in
the
code
standing
separately
you
have
the
termination
provision
and
you
have
the
early
assessment
provision
which
is
an
exception
for
the
administrative
appeal.
and
now
in
1924
congress
decided
that
the
administrative
appeal
was
not
a
sufficient
remedy
for
taxpayers,
because
essentially
it
was
conducted
by
bureau
of
internal
revenue
employees,
so
they
established
an
independent
form
for
the
review
of
these
cases
and
it
was
called
the
board
of
tax
appeal.
now
the
important
thing
to
remember
is
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
was
roughly
equivalent
to
this
administrative
appeal
and
again
because
they
would
be
a
delay,
possible
delay,
in
the
board
of
tax
appeals
proceeding
and
the
commissioner
was
not
permitted
in
general
to
assess
or
collect
taxes
while
a
board
of
tax
appeal
proceeding
was
being
invoked
congress
again
provided
this
kind
of
proviso
that
is
despite
the
fact
that
you
have
this
board
of
tax
appeal
proceeding
that
the
commissioner
could
assess
and
collect
taxes
while
the
thing
was
you
know
even
though
the
taxpayer
had
invoked
the
board
of
tax
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals.
now
that
essentially
in
our
view
demonstrates
two
things.
number
one
it
demonstrates
the
determination
provision
and
the
early
assessment
provision
which
originated
as
the
proviso
are
entirely
separate
provisions
and
they
shouldn't
be
merged.
now
one
of
the
assumptions
on
of
the
really
in
basic
assumptions
upon
which
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
here
and
the
decision
of
fifth
circuit
and
clark
against
campbell
rest
is
that
the
commissioner
as
assessment
authority
in
the
termination
case
derives
from
section
6861
this
early
assessment
provision
and
that
the
commissioner
can
--
that
in
effect,
the
early
assessment
provision
must
be
invoked
as
part
of
determination
process
but
that
as
the
statutory
history
demonstrates
that
is
not
so.
the
early
assessment
provision
came
in
simply
as
an
exception
to
the
administrative
appeal
procedure
and
that
administrative
appeal
procedure,
as
congress
laid
sort
of
transform
it
that
into
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
was
never
intended
adds
the
statutes
indicate
to
cover
these
termination
cases.
now
i
have
five
minutes
left
i
would
prefer
to
save
it
for
rebuttal
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
in
other
words
these
are
summary
administrative
proceedings.
yes
that
these
are
the
proceedings
that
is
the
proceedings
you
know
that
connote
assessment
and
the
levy
a
power
and
distraint
power
in
the
section
6331
in
other
words
first
you
have
this
determination
and
then
you
have
administrative
acts
proceedings
so
to
speak
which
include
the
assessment
on
the
6201,
yes
and
if
the
taxpayer
refuses
then
to
pay
the
involuntary
means
of
extracting
payment
by
levy
and
distraint,
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
no,
no
we
haven't
levied.
the
levy
provision
is
in
section
6331
on
page
57
of
our
brief
all
section
6851
authorizes
the
commissioner
to
do
is
to
terminate
someone's
taxable
year
and
then
determine
that
an
amount
is
due
immediately
due
in
payable
without
more
that
the
collection
cannot
be
just
on
that
statutory
language
alone
collection
cannot
be
affected.
in
order
for
collection
to
be
affected
the
commissioner
of
then
has
to
make
and
that
the
administrative
act
of
recording
the
taxpayers,
tax
liability
on
the
service's
books
account
as
an
assessment
and
then
once
having
taken
that
act,
which
is
entitled
to
tremendous
presumption
of
correctness
and
operates
very
much
like
the
civil
judgment,
then
the
commissioner
it
presents
that
assessment
for
the
taxpayer
and
says
“pay
this
assessment”
and
if
he
doesn't
pay
then
the
commissioner
must
invoke
other
statutory
remedies
to
effect
collection.
but
6851
simply
authorizes
termination
and
the
determination
of
an
amount
immediately
doing
payable,
because
without
that
statute
the
taxes
would
not
be
immediately
--
would
not
be
due
in
payable
until
the
following
april.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.

63
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
without
saying
--
i'm
not
sure
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
what
did
we
do
with
for
the
money
we
make
--
we
seized
the
money
we
made
an
assessment
and
we
asked
the
taxpayer
to
pay
the
assessment.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh
yes
but
if
you
down
at
the
bottom
it
says
“if
the
secretary
is
delegated,
makes
the
finding
of
the
collection
such
taxes
and
jeopardy
notice
and
demand
for
immediate
payment
maybe
made
upon
failure
or
refusal
to
pay
collection
thereof
by
levy
shall
be
lawful
without
regard
to
the
ten
day
period
provided
in
this
section.”
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
just
a
few
points
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
the
record
in
both
these
cases
cannot
support
any
inference
that
the
commissioner's
efforts
in
this
regard
are
anything
but
tax
collection
efforts.
there
is
no
suggestion
on
these
records
that
these
cases
involve
any
harassment.
indeed
the
court
last
term
involved
jones
university
and
americans
united
said
simply
that
you
cannot
impute
that
kind
of
motivation
other
than
tax
collecting
efforts
to
the
commissioner
without
a
solid
factual
foundation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
that's
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
what
happen
in
the
whole
case
was
she
filed
the
tax
return
reporting
$530.00
of
gross
income
for
the
full
taxable
year
and
claiming
a
refund
of
some
$76.00
on
taxes
withheld.
now
the
commissioner
was
subject
to
an
injunction
by
the
district
court
which
was
affirmed
in
the
sixth
circuit
in
hall
which
said
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
make
any
tax
collection
steps
against
her
for
the
assessment
for
the
terminated
period.
it
was
determined
that
unless
the
refund
was
paid
because
no
stay
was
sought
that
the
commissioner
might
well
be
in
contempt
of
the
district
court's
order.
so
that
amount
was
paid.
that
payment
in
no
way
can
notes
that
the
commissioners
satisfied
that
mrs.
hall
has
fully
complied
with
the
tax
law
liability
for
the
year
1973.
to
the
contrary,
it
was
simply
made
in
order
to
avoid
any
suggestion
that
the
internal
revenue
service
might
be
violating
a
court
order
by
applying
the
$76.00
claim
to
the
amount
to
the
assessment.
i
think
i
want
to
make
something
else
clear
because
there's
been
some
confusion
on
the
point
of
the
effect
of
the
filling
of
a
notice
of
deficiency.
the
effect
of
a
filling
of
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
a
jeopardy
situation
does
not
restrain
and
the
invocation
of
tax
court
jurisdiction
does
not
restrain
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
from
continuing
to
collect
taxes.
if
you
look
at
section
6213
(a)
which
is
set
forth
at
page
56
of
appendix
a
of
our
brief,
you
see
that
there
is
an
exception
down
at
the
last
three
lines,
exceptions
otherwise
provided
in
section
6861
no
assessment
or
deficiency
so
forth
and
so
on.
so
the
jeopardy
situation
is
an
exception
to
the
normal
rule
that
attacks
court
preceding
states
collection.
but
what
i
want
to
emphasize
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
6213
(a).
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
page
56
of
our
brief.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
what
i
want
to
emphasize
here
is
that
what
this
case
really
involves
is
a
congressional
decision
to
allocate
jurisdiction
in
these
particular
cases
forthe
district
courts
and
not
to
the
tax
court.
and
indeed,
sending
a
notice
of
deficiency
to
the
taxpayers
so
i
think
the
court
is
well
aware
doesn't
really
provide
them
with
any
particular
benefit
in
these
cases.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh!
i
suppose
the
earliest
possible
time
is
i
suppose
the
day
after
the
levy
and,
you
know,
the
collection
was
made,
the
taxpayer
could
file
a
claim
for
refund
with
the
district
directors
office.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
it
takes
--
you
know
that
is
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
the
maximum.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
commissioner
they
can
take
six
months
under
i
think
its
section
6532
of
the
code
so
and
then
he
can
file
a
complaint
the
day
after
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
so
that's
a
six
months
the
earliest
possible
time?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes
so
i
don't
think,
quite
frankly
i
think
on
the
basis
of
what
the
court
said
long
ago
in
philips
case,
i
think
that
that
constitutes
an
adequate
post
collection
judicial
remedy.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well
that's
not
quite
so,
i
mean
because
the
court
ought
to
be
aware
of
the
fact
that
if
something
is
completely
without
any
foundation,
this
court
has
created
an
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act
in
the
williams
packing
case.
that
is
if
the
taxpayer
can
demonstrate
that
under
no
circumstances
could
the
government
prevail
on
the
merits
of
its
claim
and
then
if
equity
jurisdiction
otherwise
exist.
so
there
is
that
narrow
remedy
for
the
case
in
which
the
commissioner
has
made
a
totally
wild
and
unsupported
claim.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
will
be
quite
possible.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
two
consolidated
cases
come
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
for
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals
for
the
second
and
sixth
circuits.
the
circuits
have
split
on
the
question
whether
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
is
required
to
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
connection
with
his
termination
of
a
taxpayer’s
taxable
year
pursuant
to
his
statutory
authority
under
section
6851
of
the
code.
the
practical
significance
of
this
procedural
question
focuses
on
the
anti-injunction
act
which
the
court
has
had
recent
opportunity
to
explore
section
7421a
of
the
code
which
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
65
in
the
appendix.
that
provision,
generally,
provides
that
no
suit
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
the
assessment
to
a
collection
of
any
tax
shall
be
maintained
in
any
court
by
any
person.
and,
if
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
is
not
required
to
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
these
cases,
which
we
submit
is
the
case,
then
these
suits
are
barred
by
that
act.
now,
the
taxpayers
in
these
cases
and
the
courts
that
have
held
against
our
position
have
focused
on
the
prefatory
exception
phrase
at
the
anti-injunction
act
which
provides
acceptance
provided
in
section
6212a
and
c,
6213a.
now,
that
prefatory
exception
deals
with
cases
which
are
adjudicable
by
the
tax
court.
so,
in
script
of
all
the
statutory
language,
these
cases
really
present
the
question
whether
it
is
an
assessment
of
taxes
which
are
deemed
to
be
immediately
due
and
payable
under
section
6851a
are
adjudicable
by
the
tax
court.
now,
we
submit
that
the
terms
of
the
statute
of
and
the
historical
evidence
clearly
indicates
that
congress
decided
not
to
give
the
tax
court
jurisdiction
in
these
cases.
that
is,
that
when
the
commissioner
terminates
someone’s
taxable
year
in
the
middle
of
that
year
and
then
makes
an
assessment
pursuant
to
section
6201a
of
taxes
immediately
due
and
payable,
that
that
administrative
action
is
not
immediately
reviewable
in
the
tax
court
but
that
the
taxpayer
must
seek
other
remedies
specifically
the
refund
suit
ruled
in
the
district
court.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
are
a
variety
of
legislative
proposals
currently
being
considered
to
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
was
testimony
held
this
summer
before
a
subcommittee
of
the
ways
and
means
committee,
i
understand,
but
i
am
not
prepared
to
speak
about
the
details
of
those
proposals
and
i
think
that
it
is
entirely
speculative
at
this
juncture
whether
there
will
be
any
litigation.
nevertheless,
the
conflict
continues
to
exist.
the
facts
of
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
can
do
it
right
now,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
issue
in
the
shapiro
case.
shapiro
involves
a
jeopardy
assessment
under
section
6861a
which
we
contend,
in
this
case,
is
an
entirely
distinct
statutory
provision
which
should
not
be
merged
into
the
termination
provision.
the
question
in
shapiro
is
a
burden
of
proof
question.
our
position
in
that
case
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
improperly
imposed
upon
the
government,
the
burden
of
proving
the
validity
of
its
assessment
in
a
straight
injunctive
action.
in
other
words,
what
happened
to
the
taxpayer
in
shapiro
was
simply
that
he
was
subjected
to
an
early
assessment,
under
section
6861a,
not
a
termination
and
he
sued
to
enjoin
that
assessment
and
was,
of
course,
bound
by
the
court’s
judicially
created
exception
in
the
enochs
v.
williams
packing
co.
case.
and,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
that,
in
no
circumstances,
the
commissioner
was
obliged
to
come
forward
with
some
sort
of
evidence
demonstrating
the
validity
of
his
assessment,
and
we
think
our
position
in
that
case
is
that
the
burden
of
proof
rests
on
the
taxpayer
to
demonstrate
that.
number
one,
he
is
entitled
to
equitable
relief
because
no
adequate
remedy
of
law
is
available
and,
number
two,
that
under
no
circumstances
can
the
government
prevail
on
the
merits
of
its
claim.
so
to
the
extent
that
both
cases
involving
the
anti-injunction
act,
they
are
related
but
they
involve
these
disparate
provisions
of
the
code,
the
termination
provision
and
the
early
assessment
provision.
i
think
that
the
facts
can
be
briefly
stated
and
they
are
basically
undisputed--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
we
do
and,
in
fact,
it
is
our
submission
that
the
confusion
that
has
risen
in
the
area
has
risen
out
of
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
statutory
history
that
these
statutes
both
came
in
separately
with
design
to
do
quite
separate
things
and
that
the
terms
of
one
should
not
be
judicially
incorporated
into
the
other.
before
i
get
into
the
legal
questions,
i
think
it
probably
would
be
worthwhile
to
review
briefly
the
facts
in
both
of
these
cases.
in
the
laing
case
from
the
second
circuit,
the
taxpayer
is
a
citizen
of
new
zealand.
in
may
1972,
he
entered
the
united
states
from
canada
on
a
visitor’s
visa.
on
the
evening
of
july
24,
1972,
in
fact
in
the
early
morning
hours,
he
and
two
other
people
in
a
rented
automobile
attempted
to
reenter
canada.
the
canadian
officials
were
dissatisfied
with
the
identification
proffered
by
one
of
the
passengers
in
the
vehicle
and
they
refused
entry
to
the
trio
into
canada.
they
then
had
to
turn
around
and
go
back
to
the
united
states.
this
was
a
crossing
at
derby
line,
vermont.
upon
attempted
reentry
back
into
the
united
states,
they
were
subjected
to
a
search
of
their
vehicle
by
the
united
states
customs
and
the
search
revealed
that
a
suitcase
in
the
engine
compartment
of
the
car
contained
approximately
$300,000
in
united
states
currency.
search
of
the
persons
revealed
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
laing,
had
a
quantity
of
hashish
on
his
possession.
the
customs
officials
thereupon,
as
is
the
procedure,
notified
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue
for
the
district
of
vermont.
because
of
the
unusual
happenstance,
it
is
a
highly
unusual
circumstance
that
people
are
traveling
with
so
much
cash
concealed
in
the
engine
compartment
of
their
car,
and
the
internal
revenue
service
exercised
its
statutory
power
under
section
6851,
the
termination
provision,
and
terminated
the
taxable
years
of
all
three
passengers
as
of
that
date,
june
24,
1972.
now,
ultimately,
assessments
of
approximately
$195,000
were
imposed
against
each
of
the
three
persons.
these
assessments,
as
i
mentioned
last
time,
were
computed
on
the
well-established
net
worth
plus
non-deductible
expenditures
method.
petitioner
laing
was
questions
as
to
how
long
he
had
been
in
the
united
states.
it
turned
out
to
be
25-30
days.
the
amount
of
money
was
quite
of
his
net
worth.
a
sum
was
computed
also
for
his
non-deductible
living
expenses
and
then
the
tax
computation
easily
follows
from
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suppose
that
is
correct,
although
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
cannot
say
that
with
certainty
but,
of
course--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
that
is
the
case,
although
that
does
not
contradict
the
notion
that
the
money
in
his
possession
could
have
been
earnings
from
us
sources.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
could
well
have
been
and
i
think
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
situation
that
the
statute
is
designed
to
protect
the
revenue.
people
are
trying
to
leave
the
country
with
large
amounts
of
property.
the
statute
uses
the
terms
“if
the
secretary
or
his
delegate
finds
that
a
taxpayer
designs
quickly
to
depart
from
the
united
states
or
to
remove
his
property
there
from.”
it
seems
to
us
that
the
statute
fits
these
facts
like
a
glove.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
record
is
silent
on
this,
but
my
understanding
is
that
a
sum
of
money
was
allocated
for
living
expenses
for
each
day
and
that
was
added
on
to
the
amount
of
his
net
worth.
in
other
words,
in
a
normal
conquest
you
have
an
opening
net
worth
and
a
closing
net
worth.
the
opening
net
worth,
i
suppose,
have
to
be
deemed
to
be
zero.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
when
people
are
essentially—it
is
not--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
that
is
a
warranted
assumption
under
the—essentially,
our
system
works
under
the
ground
rules
that
the
taxpayer
has
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i
think
that,
in
connection
with
a
non-resident
alien
taxpayer,
they
are
even
more
applicable
where
people
are
coming
and
going.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that
is
true.
he
has
to
have
income
from
us
sources.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
yes,
i
suppose
but
his
explanation
could
be
forthcoming
that
it
could
be
his
grandmother’s
inheritance.
at
the
same
time,
when
someone
is
concealing
money
in
the
engine
compartment
of
an
automobile,
it
is
an
unconventional
means
of
transporting
a
large
sum
of
money,
and
i
think--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
may
do
things
differently.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
bandits
along
the
road,
yes,
there
are
a
number
of
possibilities
but
it
is
equally
plausible
that
this
was
earnings
from
us
sources
which
was
subject
to
united
states
tax,
and
i
think
that
the
equal--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely,
but
the
point
is,
unless
the
commissioner
takes
this
action,
the
money
is
gone
and
the
statute
is
designed
to
provide
the
treasury
with
a
mechanism
of
insuring
that
money
does
not
slip
through
the
fingers
of
the
treasury
because
tax
returns
are
normally
due
on
the
following
april
15
or
in
the
case
where
you
live
abroad
on
june
15,
and
if
they
just
examined
this
situation
and
said
“well,
thank
you
very
much,
please
file
your
tax
return
next
june”
and
explain
this
happenstance
to
us,
the
strong
likelihood
is
that
they
would
never
hear
from
him
again,
so
i
think
it
is
not
an
entirely
unreasonable
response
to
an
extraordinary
set
of
facts.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
basic
validity
of
the
termination
provisions
is
not
at
issue,
nor
is
the
commissioner’s
application
of
them
in
this
case.
now
the
taxpayer,
laing,
refused
to
pay
the
tax
so
the
commissioner
then
was
forced
to
levy
on
this--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
are
not
an
issue
with
laing.
i
do
not
view
them
at
issue
in
whole
either.
it
seems
to
us
that
these
cases
came
up
on
the
narrow
question
as
to
whether
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
has
to
issue
notice
of
deficiency
in
these
cases,
and
that
if
he
does--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
is
a
constitutional
issue
in
waiting
in
the
wings,
so
to
speak,
but
that
depends
upon
what--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
they
are
subject
to
question
only
if--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
only
if
the
courts
which
have
held
against
us
are
correct
in
their
assumption
that
the
tax
court
remedy
is
the
sole
remedy
in
these
circumstances.
we
think
that
that
is
based
on
a
misreading
of
the
court’s
flora
opinion
and
that
there
is
an
adequate
remedy
in
the
district
court.
so,
we
think
the
constitutional
issue
vanishes
once
that
is
considered
in
some
detail.
now,
the
district
court
dismissed
this
suit
on
the
basis
of
the
anti-injunction
act
and
the
second
circuit
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
its
decision
in
the
irving
case.
the
whole
facts
are
relatively
parallel,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
received
information
that
mrs.
hall
was
engaged
in
narcotics
trafficking
and
he
terminated
her
taxable
year
as
to
january
31,
1973.
the
assessment
in
that
case
also
proceeded
on
a
projection
of
volume
of
activity
and
it
came
out
to
be
something
like
$52,000.
now,
the
taxpayer
hall,
also
refused
to
pay
the
tax
but,
contrary
to
what
happened
in
the
district
court
of
vermont
in
the
second
circuit,
the
district
court
granted
a
preliminary
injunction
and
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
its
decision
in
rambo
which
is
still
awaiting
disposition
by
the
court
on
our
petition.
now,
we
think
that
it
is
worthwhile
to
consider
how
these
statutes
come
into
play.
if
you
look
at
page
60
and
61
at
our
brief
you
see,
as
i
have
mentioned,
that
the
secretary
or
his
delegates
finds
that
a
taxpayer
either
designs
quickly
to
depart
from
the
united
states
or
intends
to
conceal
himself
or
his
property.
he
can
terminate
someone’s
taxable
year.
now
that
termination,
by
itself,
that
administrative
action
does
not
affect
any
collection
activity.
all
that
we
have
is
an
artificial
termination
of
the
taxable
year
and
a
declaration
that
the
taxes
are
immediately
due
and
payable.
without
law,
the
commissioner
could
not
collect
these
taxes,
but
there
is
an
assessment
provision
of
the
code
which
we
set
forth
at
page
53
of
our
brief,
section
6201a.
and,
that
provision
empowers
the
secretary
to
make
the
inquiries
determinations
and
assessments
of
all
taxes.
so,
it
is
a
combination
of
the
termination
power,
and
this
assessment
power,
which
is
a
very
old
statute,
which,
in
its
present
form,
dates
around
1872
but
actually
is
much
older
than
that
because
it
basically
is
the
essential
assessment
power
for
the
collection
of
taxes
which
have
been
going
on
since
the
beginning
of
the
republic
when
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
was
alexander
hamilton
and
the
taxes
were
excised
and
the
molasses
and
whiskey
taxes.
so,
there
is
no
doubt
that
this
power
exists
and
that
it
is
independent
of
any
other
provision
of
the
code.
now,
once
the
commissioner
makes--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
exactly,
it
is
simply
a
notation
but
it
is
an
important
notation
because
it
enables
the
commissioner
then,
once
the
assessment
is
made
to
exercise
his
extraordinary
collection
and
voluntary
collection
powers.
he
can
then,
i
see
that
we--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
adjourned,
i
was
discussing
the
operation
of
the
various
statutory
provisions
that
come
into
play
upon
a
termination
and
they
are,
essentially,
the
termination
out
of
section
6851
and
then
the
assessment
that
follows
this
clerical
notation
by
the
commissioner
which
has
the
effect
of
a
judgment
upon
which
the
taxes
can
then
be
collected
by
involuntary
means
which
were
done
in
these
cases,
because
these
taxpayers
both
refused
to
pay
the
amount
deemed
to
be
immediately
due
and
payable.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
authority
to
seize
the
money
comes
from
section
6331
which
is
set
forth
at
page
57
of
our
brief
which
is
entitled
“levy
and
distraint”,
and
that,
essentially,
allows
the
commissioner
to
collect
the
tax
from
any
person
liable
to
pay
who
neglects
and
refuses
to
pay.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
you
have
to
take
the
last
sentence
of
that
because
it
says
that
the
secretary,--
well,
i
suppose
that
is
one
way
to
look
at
it
because,
if
you
take
that
then
we
are--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
you
do
not
have
to
give
him
ten
days
notice
for
either
one
of
two
reasons.
either,
one,
because
section
6851--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
see.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
then
on
account
of
the
last
sentence
which
says
“
if
the
secretary
or
his
delegates
makes
a
finding
that
collection
of
the
tax
is
in
jeopardy,”
it
seems
to
us
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
where
was
that
finding?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
seems
to
us
that
that
finding
is
implicit
and
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
finding
is
implicit
in
the
invocation
of
section--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
answer
is
no,
but
i
would
suggest
that
once
you
make
a
finding
on
the
section
6851,
that
a
taxpayer
designs
quickly
to
depart
from
the
united
states
or
to
conceal
himself
or
his
property
therein
or
to
do
any
act
tending
to
prejudice
or
render
partly
or
in
a
factual
proceedings
to
collect
the
income
tax,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
collection
of
the
revenue
is
endangered
by
the
taxpayer’s
actions.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there
is
no
word
like
“jeopardy”
in
section
6851,
no,
but--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
okay.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
slightly,
it
is
somewhat
different.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right,
but
may
i
just
go
back
a
moment.
when
we
make
a
finding
on
the
section
6861
that
the
assessment
or
collection
of
a
deficiency
will
be
jeopardized
by
delay
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
61.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
tax
is
already
due
and,
i
think,
that
distinction
has
been
missed
by
the
courts
that
have
merged
these
two
provisions.
in
the
case
of
the
termination
provision,
the
tax
is
not
due
because
there
is
no
return
for
the
short
period.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right.
the
commissioner
makes
a
declaration.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right
and
what
makes
it
due
and
payable,
we
submit,
is
the
commissioner’s
finding
that
the
taxpayer’s
actions
have
contributed
to
a
situation
which
warrants
termination
and
declaration
that
the
tax
is
immediately
due
and
payable.
section
6861,
what
i
would
call
the
early
assessment
provision,
i
think
that
the
word
“jeopardy”
confuses
the
matter
and
i
think
that
is
where
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit
have
gone
right
here
because
it
is
very
easy
to
use
the
word
“jeopardy”
in
a
loose
sort
of
way
and
then
conclude
that
the
statutes
were
designed
to
do
roughly
the
same
thing,
but
they
are
designed
to
do
quite
different
things.
in
one
case,
you
have
a
taxpayer
where
his
taxes
are
not
due.
he
is
in
the
middle
of
the
year.
he
does
not
have
to
pay
any
deals.
he
would
have
to
make--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
and
declares
them
due
and
payable.
now,
in
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
then
become
due
and
payable.
in
the
section
6861,
what
we
call
the
early
assessment
provision,
the
taxes
are
already
due
and
payable
but
the
commissioner
has
determined
that
if
he
waits
to
collect
them,
then
the
assets
will
no
longer
be
available,
and
i
think
that
is
a
big
difference
because,
in
the
first
situation,
the
taxpayer’s
own
actions
have
contributed
to
the
necessity
of
the
commissioner
taking
the
extraordinary
action
of
terminating
his
taxable
year
and
declaring
the
taxes
due
and
payable.
in
the
other
situation,
while
it
could
be
the
taxpayer’s
own
actions,
there
were
a
variety
of
other
situations
which
can
contribute
to
an
early
assessment
under
section
6861.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
say
that
every
time
there
is
an
assessment
and
the
assessment
is
valid,
there
is
a
deficiency,
not
necessarily
so,
unless
you
use
deficiency
in
a
colloquial
way
to
mean
an
amount--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
would
say
that
every
time
we
make
an
assessment,
there
is
an
amount
owing
it.
it
is
not
necessarily
a
deficiency.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
is
a
balance
of
a
tax
that
is
owing.
it
seems
to
us
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
even
if
there
has
been
no
return
filed
because
the
commissioner
has
made
an
artificial
termination
of
the
taxable
year
and
declared
it
closed.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
it
is--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
by
artificial,
i
mean,
simply
it
is
not
by
operation
to
the
calendar.
now,
i
think
that
once
the
distinction
between
the
two
situations
arrive,
is
made
clear,
because
in
the
early
assessment
provision
it
could
simply
mean
that
the
taxpayer
is
going
bankrupt
or
he
is
a
person
who
fritters
away
his
assets
for
one
reason
or
another,
and
the
taxpayer
in
such
a
situation
if
the
commissioner
is
going
to
take
the
normal
route
of
allowing
the
tax
court
proceeding
to
stay
collection
until
that
is
finished,
then
it
is
quite
possible
that
whatever
decision
the
courts
reach
as
to
what
the
taxes
are
owing,
there
is
not
going
to
be
any
ability
to
collect
on
the
deficiency.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
once
that
is
understood,
that
is
why
the
tax
court
has
jurisdiction
in
the
early
assessment
provision
and
not
in
the
termination
provision
because
if
you
look
at
page
71
of
our
brief
which
sets
forth
the
revenue
act
of
1921,
the
proviso
on
page
71
of
our
brief
which
reads
“provided
that
in
cases
where
the
commissioner
believes
that
the
collection
of
the
amount
due
will
be
jeopardized
by
such
delay,
he
may
make
the
assessment
without
giving
such
notice
or
waiting
the
conclusion
of
such
hearing.”
that
proviso
came
in
as
an
exception
to
an
administrative
appeal
procedure
which
was
enacted
in
1921,
under
which,
a
taxpayer
could
seek
an
administrative
review
and
collection
would
not
occur
during
that
time.
now,
in
order
to
provide
for
the
situation
where
the
taxpayer’s
assets
might
not
be
available
after
the
administrative
review
is
complete,
congress
enacted
that
proviso.
that
proviso
is
the
direct
statutory
antecedent
of
section
6861,
the
jeopardy
assessment
provision.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
under
that
provision
well,
yes,
that
is
true.
we
cannot
sell,
but
the
reason--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
congress
has
made
that
choice,
in
fact,
the
no
sale
restrictions
did
not
come
in
until
the
1954
code.
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
the
termination
provision
operated
stood
in
the
statutes
independently
of
the
early
assessment
provision
for
three
years
from
1918-1921
and,
under
those
circumstances,
a
taxpayer
taxable
year
could
be
terminated,
the
commissioner
could
be
sell,
seize
his
assets,
if
he
does
not
voluntarily
pay
and,
in
fact,
he
would
not
have
any
remedy
to
go
to
the
tax
court
because
the
tax
court
did
not
even
exist
at
that
time.
his
only
remedy
would
be
a
refund
suit.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
rests
in
part--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it
rests
in
part
on
that
three-year
interval,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
but
i
do
not
think
that
is
the
only
thing
it
rests
on.
i
think
that
another
important
thing
which
i
think
deserves
emphasis
is
the
fact
that
when
the
board
of
tax
appeals
was
created
in
the
revenue
act
of
1924,
the
board
was
authorized
to
hear
specifically
enumerated
cases,
and
those
enumerated
cases
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
32.
they
involve
section
274,
that
is,
the
ordinary
kind
of
deficiency
case,
279
relating
to
claims
abatement
of
deficiencies
assessed
under
section
274d,
and
274d
is
this
early
assessment
provision,
and
then
there
are
some
others.
i
think
the
important
thing
is
that
when
congress
set
up
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
which
is
the
predecessor
of
the
tax
court,
it
enumerated
a
class
of
cases
and
notably
absent
from
this
list
was
termination
cases
under
what
was
then
section
146
of
the
code
over
the
revenue
act
and
is
now
the
termination
provision
in
the
revenue
code
of
1954.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
has
made
a
conscious
choice,
and
i
think
that
the
courts
that
have
gone
astray
on
this
question
have
taken
the
creation
of
the
board
of
tax
appeals
in
the
loosest
possible
and
derived
from
it
a
lesson
which
we
do
not
think
is
properly
learned
from.
congress
created
this
court.
it
is
a
creature
of
statute.
it
is
designed
to
see
and
hear
certain
cases,
for
example,
it
is
not
designed
to
hear
excise
tax
cases
and,
under
section
6862
of
the
code,
we
can
terminate
a
taxpayer’s
taxable
year
in
an
excise
tax
case
and
there
is
no
notice
of
deficiency.
there
is
no
tax
court
review.
i
think
that
is
absolutely
plain.
we
think
that
this
case
represents
the
same
kind
of
congressional
decision.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
positions
of
the
courts
that
have
rejected
the
commissioner’s
assertion,
that
no
notice
of
deficiency
is
required,
rests
on
two
notions,
essentially.
one,
that
the
assessment
power
in
a
termination
case
derives
from
section
6861
and,
therefore,
the
statutes
have
to
be
merged
because
they
operate
in
tandem.
we
do
not
think
that
is
right.
in
fact,
the
three-year
gap
really
proves
that
it
is
not
right
because,
for
three
years,
this
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
could
assess
taxes
pursuant
to
a
termination
and
there
was
no
section
6861
to
provide
them
with
any
assessment
authority.
the
assessment
authority
derived
from
the
predecessor
of
sections--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
is
very
important.
it
is
very
important
because
the
courts
that
have
rejected
our
position,
in
order
to
find
the
requirement
for
a
notice
of
deficiency,
they
have
had
to
look
to
subsection
d
of
the
early
assessment
provision,
section
6861.
and,
they
have
essentially
merged
those
two
statutory
provisions.
we
do
not
think
that
they
are
properly
merged
because
we
think
they
developed
quite
independently
with
each
other.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
let
me
go
back.
the
courts
that
have
rejected
our
position
have
said
section
6861
by
itself,
and
i
agree,
does
not
arm
the
commissioner
with
any
assessment
authority.
it
simply
gives
them
the
power
to
terminate
and
declare
the
taxes
immediately
due
and
payable,
but
there
can
be
no
collection
without
an
assessment.
now,
in
order
to--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
essentially,
i
think
that
is
generally
so.
a
tax--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
you
have
to
have
an
assessment
of
the
tax
before--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
am
not
sure
i
can
point
to
any
particular
provision
in
the
code,
but--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
need
an
assessment
because,
essentially,
it
is
upon
the
existence
of
an--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
okay,
i
think
that
you
need
an
assessment
because
that
administrative
act,
that
notation
in
the
commissioner’s
books
of
account
provides
the
basis
for
the
operation
for
the
collection
provisions.
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
quarrel
about
that
in
this
case.
i
think
the
quarrel
in
this
case
arises
out
of
where
that
assessment
authority
comes
from,
in
connection
with
the
termination
of
the
taxable
year.
now,
we
say
it
comes
from
the
basic
assessment
authority
which
says
the
commissioner
shall
be
empowered
to
assess
all
taxes.
once
you
realize
that,
that
it
does
not
come
from
section
6861,
that
that
thing
simply
came
in
as
a
proviso
and
the
commissioner’s
assessment
authority
long
antedates
that
provision.
then,
i
think
one
of
the
major
props
upon
which
the
courts,
like
clark
v.
campbell
and
the
schreck
case,
i
think
fall
away.
and,
i
think
that
the
other
prop
of
those
cases
is
essentially
that
tax
court
review
is
an
important
matter
and,
without
it,
we
are
depriving
the
taxpayers
of
some
basic
right.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
taxpayer
can
seek
an
immediate
refund,
can
file
a
claim
for
refund
and
seek
immediate
redress
in
the
district
court.
i
think
that
the
facts
in
the
laing
case
demonstrate
that
because
a
refund
suit
has
been
pending
in
the
district
court
of
vermont
since
1973
with
no
action
on
it.
it
is
awaiting
the
disposition
of
this
case,
but
it
need
not
wait
the
disposition
of
this
case.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
flora
rule,
as
we
point
out
fully
in
our
brief,
has
no
application
here
because
that
case
was
premised
on
the
existence
of
tax
court
review
which
we
say
congress
has
specifically
foreclosed
in
these
cases.
i
think
that
the
if
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i
think
that
the
suggestion
of
unconstitutionality
is
without
merit.
the
reason
it
is
without
merit,
essentially,
is
because
the
suggestion
of
unconstitutionality
rests
on
the
fact
that
we
are
blocking
the
taxpayer’s
access
to
the
courts
to
review
these
actions
by
the
commissioner.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
we
are
not.
we
are
not
because
the
taxpayer
can
file
a
claim
for
refund
after
one
of
these
collection
actions
and
then
bring
a
refund
suit
in
the
district
court,
and
i
think--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
how
long
does
he
have
to
wait?
well,
i
think
that
the
code
provides
that
the
commissioner
has
the
maximum
of
six
months
to
act
on
a
refund
claim
and,
after
that,
he
can
commence
a
suit,
but
i
think
the
time
is
misleading
in
a
way
too
because
it
is
not
entirely
clear
that
tax
court
review
would
be
that
much
faster
than
a
district
court
suit.
in
fact,
here
in
the
laing
case
where
a
suit
is
pending
in
the
district
court
in
vermont,
it
could
have
been
resolved
ages
ago
without
necessity
or
need
for
a
tax
court
review.
i
think
that
is
absolutely
clear.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely
not
and
we
think
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
let
us
put
it
this
way.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
i
think
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
we
think
that,
although
i
must
point
out
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case
the
refund
claim
was
filed
by
the
taxpayer
laing
on
march
1,
1973,
and
it
was
denied
on
march
9,1973
and
this
suit
could
have
been
brought
on
march
10.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absolutely
and,
here,
essentially
the
commissioner
has
a
maximum
of
six
months
and
he
often
takes
much
less
to
dispose
off
a
refund
claim
like
this
one
in
which
it
was
clear
that
it
was
going
to
be
denied.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
if
he
does
not
act
at
all,
then
at
six
months
and
one
day
the
taxpayer
can
go
to
the
district
court.
we
think
that
is
an
adequate
remedy
which
fully
meets
the
court’s
test
of
due
process
in
the
phillips
case,
but--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
yes
because
if
the
six
months
rule
did
not
exist,
then
i
think
the
courts
would
be
flooded
with
all
sorts
of
refund
suits
that
could
easily
wash
out
after
administrative
review
and
i
think
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
as
an
administrative
matter,
is
entitled
to
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
to
appraise
the
validity
of
a
claim
before
the
taxpayer
seeks
judicial
redress.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
think
it
is
hard
to
generalize
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that,
then,
on
the
facts
of
the
liang
case
of
course,
the
injunction
should
not
issue.
that
is
very
plain
because
the
commissioner
denied
it.
the
court,
i
suppose,
would
have
to
announce
a
time
frame
somewhat
less
than
six
months.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
would
think
not.
i
do
not
think
the
constitutional
issue
was
presented
on
the
facts
of
this
case
as
you
put
it.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
hall
has
never
brought
a
refund
suit
at
all
and
has
never
filed
a
refund
claim
so
i
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
the
constitutional
issue
was
probably
framed
on
those
facts
either
because
she
has
not
availed
herself
of
that
remedy.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
did
not
sell
her
car
without
notice
because
she
was
able
to
post
a
bond
as
the
termination
provisions
provide.
she
still
has
her
car,
as
i
understand.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
have
her
bond
but
that,
of
course,
is
always
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
suppose
so
and
--
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
