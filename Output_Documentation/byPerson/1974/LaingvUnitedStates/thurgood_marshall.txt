versus
hall,
here
are
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
second
and
sixth
circuits.
these
cases
involve
two
taxpayers
whose
taxable
years
were
terminated
by
the
internal
revenue
service
prior
to
the
normal
expiration
dates,
pursuant
to
the
jeopardy
termination
provisions,
section
6851
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
this
section
allows
the
irs
immediately
to
terminate
a
taxpayer’s
taxable
period
when
it
finds
that
the
taxpayer
intended
to
commit
any
act
tending
to
prejudice
the
collection
of
his
income
tax
for
the
current
or
proceeding
taxable
year.
in
such
cases,
a
tax
is
due
immediately
upon
termination.
in
each
of
the
instant
cases,
the
irs
levied
upon
to
seize
the
taxpayer’s
property
without
sending
any
notice

deficiency,

suit
in

tax
court,
and
without
following
the
other
procedures
mandated
by
section
6861
of
the
code,
which
prescribes
for
the
procedure
for
the
assessment
and
collection
of
deficiencies
whose
collection
is
in
jeopardy.
the
government
contends
that
these
procedures
are
not
applicable
to
6851,
because
such
termination
do
not
create
the
efficiency
within
the
meaning
of
that
word.
in
no.
73-1808,
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
vermont
accepted
the
government’s
argument
and
held
that
a
deficiency
notice
and
the
procedures
of
6861
are
not
required
for
a
6851
termination.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
in
the
other
case,
74-75,
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
kentucky
granted
the
taxpayer
relief,
holding
that
the
irs
must
follow
the
6861
procedures.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
we,
therefore,
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
tax
owing,
but
not
reported
at
the
time
of
6851
termination,
is
a
deficiency
whose
assessment
and
collection
is
subject
to
the
procedures
of
6861.
under
the
statutory
definition
of
deficiency,
the
tax
owing
and
unreported
after
jeopardy
termination
is
clearly
a
deficiency.
moreover,
to
deny
a
taxpayer
to
litigate
his
tax
liability
in
the
tax
court
is
out
of
keeping
with
the
legislative
scheme.
analysis
of
the
early
codification
of
the
code
confirms
this
conviction.
according
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,

opinion

affirmed.
