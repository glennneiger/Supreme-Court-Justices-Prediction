mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
situation
unfortunately
is
somewhat
different
than
my
brothers.
i
have
a
foreign
national
who
had
been
in
the
united
states
for
25
days,
was
departing
the
united
states
over
the
canadian
border,
was
turned
back
was
now
returning
to
the
united
states
because
he
was
unable
to
get
into
canada
and
on
a
search
of
his
car,
the
government
found
$310,000.00.
i
think
it's
important
to
first
state
that
in
answer
to
the
question
asked
by
the
chief
justice.
i
expect
or
i'm
asking
this
court
to
return
the
$310,000.00.
it's
my
contention
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
yes,
your
honor,
i
am.
i'm
saying
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
i'm
not
a
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
i'm
not
a
charitable
institution,
your
honor.
i'm
in
here
to
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
anywhere
it
like,
your
honor
after
he
leaves
my
fee,
but
the
fact
of
it
your
--
the
fact
of
the
matter,
your
honor
is
that
in
this
instance
they
seized
this
money
and
i
we
think
ought
to
look
at
how
the
money
was
seized.
there
were
three
people
involved,
your
honor.
there
was
a
lady
and
two
gentlemen
in
the
car.
they
were
stopped
at
the
border.
the
government
agents,
the
custom
agents
call
the
irs
district
director
in
vermont.
he
sent
down
a
mr.
o'cain,
he
was
his
chief
of
intelligence
and
a
mr.
perry
who
was
his
collector,
and
they
interviewed
the
three
people.
it's
my
information
that
the
two
people
other
than
mr.
laing,
the
petitioner
disclaimed
any
knowledge
of
the
money.
they
disclaimed
any
ownership.
mr.
perry
in
the
appendix
in
our
brief
your
honor,
mr.
perry's
testimony
limited
as
it
was,
is
very
revealing.
mr.
perry
says
on
again
an
answer
to
a
question
that
he
went
down
there
with
the
preordained
concept,
the
idea.
it
was
a
foregone
conclusion
he
says
to
asses
a
jeopardy
assessment
on
these
people,
but
did
they
do?
he
didn't
asses
$310,000.00
against
mr.
laing
only.
he
assessed
the
$310,000.00
assessment
against
all
three
people.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
precisely
the
question,
your
honor.
he
was
not
insufficient
in
possession
of
any
kind
of
facts
that
would
jeopardize
and
kind
of
an
assessment
against
anyone.
all
he
had
was
the
fact
as
he
says
that
there
was
$310,000.00
attempting
to
be
taken
out
of
the
country.
now,
i
can
see
if
he
wants
to
assess
it
against
mr.
laing
who
admits
the
ownership
of
the
money.
laing
doesn't
deny
it.
why
is
it
important
your
honor
that
he
assessed
it
against
the
three
people,
its
important
because
at
a
later
time,
the
government
then
reduces
the
$310,000.00
assessment
to
a
$195,985.55
against
each
of
the
three
people
involved
in
the
car.
now,
mr.
laing
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
no,
no
your
honor.
it's
against
each
of
them
because
subsequently
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
sure
judge.
they
assess
$930,000.00
worth
the
assessments
based
on
finding
$300,000.00
in
money
then
they
had
to
give
us
a
break
and
they
reduce
it
to
a
$195,000.00
against
each
and
what
they
do
to
us?
we
then
file
a
tax
return
showing
no
zero
tax
liability
because
its
our
contention
that
our
client
did
not
earn
the
money
in
the
united
states
and
no
taxes
due,
but
not
only
do
we
not
have
a
forum
in
an
attempt
to
get
a
forum
to
prove
this,
we
file
for
a
refund,
and
what
do
they
tell
us?
we
say
we
have
a
$114,000.00
coming
to
us
fellows.
they
say
no
"we
have
assessed
the
$300,000.00
taken
in
the
following
manner,
$100,100.00
each
to
each
of
the
three
of
you
on
the
$195,000.00
tax
you
owe."
now,
i'm
here
with
a
refund
suit
filed
and
i'm
staring
the
flora
decision
right
in
the
face
and
despite
what
mr.
smith
says
to
you,
i
know
that
the
government
when
we
come
to
go
before
the
judge
up
in
vermont,
the
government's
going
to
say
to
me,
“you
haven't
complied
with
the
full
payment
requirement
of
flora
and
your
out.”
unless
of
course
you
remedy
that
in
this
opinion
which
i'm
certainly
hopeful
you
will
do.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
right,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
i
don't
suggest
that
its
bound
by
it
in
the
strictly
legal
sense
your
honor,
but
i
do
suggest
one
that
as
the
government
must
have
some
valid
basis
for
making
some
form
of
a
seizure
of
person's
property,
i
think
mr.
liang
has
the
equal
right
to
say
the
property
is
mine
and
its
no
one
else
but
mine.
i
think
if
your
going
to
give
the
government
the
right
to
without
any
kind
of
a
hearing
and
this
is
probably
the
only
case,
or
the
only
situation
under
the
code,
the
short
year
jeopardy
taxpayer
is
probably
the
only
person
with
no
form,
he
can
go
to
under
the
codal
provisions
and
yet
you
allow
his
property
to
be
taken
with
no
kind
of
a
preliminary
hearing.
maybe,
your
honor
and
i
say
just
assuming
our
arguendo,
maybe
the
government
has
a
right
because
this
man
was
leaving
the
country
and
he
had
the
money
and
there
was
a
good
chance
of
the
government
is
going
to
lose
its
ability
to
collect
the
tax
in
fact
one
was
ought.
maybe
the
government
has
the
right
to
seize
that
property
but
upon
seizing
it,
i
maintain
the
due
process
demands
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
be
given
a
meaningful
hearing
and
at
meaningful
time
and
a
meaningful
place
and
by
that
i
mean
within
at
least
30
days,
the
government
should
go
before
some
judicial
officer
and
allow
the
defendant
the
petitioner
to
be
there
and
convince
that
officer
that
basically
there
is
some
--
the
money
is
in
jeopardy,
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
difficult
thing
to
do.
two,
that
there
is
some
authenticity
to
the
figure
assessed.
and
three
that
the
money
was
earned
in
america.
now
i
think
that's
the
minimum
due
process
standard
my
man
is
entitled
to.
a
simple
answer
to
those
three
questions
determined
by
a
judicial
officer
not
quite
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
who
is
very
much
busy
in
ferreting
out
criminals
as
well
as
collecting
revenue
today
your
honor,
because
this
whole
jeopardy
provision
thing
my
--
well
my
understanding
is
there
are
some
1800
uses
of
this
provision
last
year.
there's
been
an
enormous
upswing
in
the
number
of
them
and
i
can
say
basically
based
upon
my
practice
as
a
criminal
lawyer,
who
defends
people
generally
charged
with
drug
offences,
every
time
a
person
is
caught
with
any
kind
of
significant
amount
of
money,
the
government
seizes
the
money,
notifies
the
irs
and
the
irs
comes
in
and
levies
on
that
money.
this
has
been
the
rule
since
the
war
on
drugs
was
declared
in
1972,
it's
not
the
exception.
and
i
maintain
in
these
situations
your
honor,
a
pornographer
judge,
a
man
who
purveys
film
is
entitled
to
prior
determination
is
to
whether
or
not
its
filmed
or
whether
is
protected.
a
criminal
who
has
a
stolen
property
in
his
home
is
entitled
to
a
prior
determination
by
a
judicial
person
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
probable
cause
to
one
of
his
own.
my
man
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
no,
your
honor.
the
philip's
case
said
that
you
have
a
right
to
protect
the
revenue
but
the
philip's
case,
one
of
the
holding's
in
philip's
was
that
there
wasn't
immediate,
there
was
a
hearing
going
to
be
granted.
there
was
a
deficiency
notice,
there
was
a
hearing.
my
man
has
no
deficiency
notice,
just
if
i
may
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
my
man
was
grabbed.
the
money
was
grabbed
on
the
24th
of
june.
today,
even
though
in
march
of
'73,
we
filed
tax
return
we
still
have
not
received
the
deficiency
notice.
we
still
do
not
have
a
ticket
to
the
tax
court.
my
brother,
and
beware
of
prosecutors
who
worry
about
your
clients,
my
brother
tells
us,
the
government
doesn't
want
to
burden
us
with
the
tax
court
appeal
because
after
all
it
takes
two
years.
they
want
to
make
sure
we
get
a
quick
return,
a
quick
suit
for
our
money.
but
what
they're
not
telling
us
is
that
the
tax
court
is
a
place
where
they
know
tax
law.
the
average
loyal
like
myself
which
i'll
practicing
criminal
law
says
“i
don't
know
anything
about
taxes”,
this
is
been
the
most
painful
preparation
to
my
life
trying
to
get
even
conversant
with
this
law.
we
don't
know
what's
happening
if
we
go
the
tax
court
to
experts,
they
will
decide
and
they
will
decide
in
way
and
everybody
will
be
bound
by
those
decisions.
if
we
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
if
we
have
to
be
in
the
north
dakota
district
court,
in
the
florida
district
court,
your
honor
there
will
be
700
different
opinions
on
every
single
case
that
courts
will
be
just
barred
down
with
litigation.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
no,
but
it
is
your
honor
in
this
respect.
in
this
case
and
i
can't
understand
why.
all
the
government
has
to
do
and
maybe
my
brother
can
answer
a
question
if
you
choose
to
ask
him.
why
won't
they
give
us
a
deficiency
notice?
i
mean
they
tell
us
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
the
tax
court
in
a
track
year
jeopardy
preceding.
i
don't
buy
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
i
have.
i
have
your
honor
but
nothings
happen.
we're
holding
in
advance
until
this
case
had
decided
but
why
they
don't
i
want
a
suit
for
refund
immediately?
because
they're
going
to
hit
me
with
flora
rule.
they
say
i
owe
you
195,000
in
taxes.
they
took
310,000.00
away
from
me
but
they
only
gave
me
credit
for
100,000.
they
give
the
other
100,000
to
my
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
that's
what
they
say
here
your
honor
and
i
know
to
choose
my
brother
of
any
kind
of
bad
faith,
but
when
you're
up
there
in
the
district
court
of
vermont,
somebody's
going
to
raise
flora
against
me
unless
somebody
tells
them
can't
do
it.
and
the
other
thing
judge
is,
presenting
from
that
right
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
back
at
its
inception
they
were
wrong.
they
took
my
client's
money.
they've
held
it
for
two
and
a
half
years
and
won't
give
us
any
kind
of
an
opportunity
to
get
a
shot
at
getting
that
money
back.
i
filed
the
motion
asking
that
they
put
it
in
an
interest
bearing
account.
my
client
could
get
12
to
15%
interest
on
that
money.
he's
living
in
a
houseboat
new
zealand.
he
hasn't
got
the
money
to
call
me.
he
calls
me
collect
because
he
doesn't
have
any
money.
now
all
i
want
is
an
interest
bearing
account,
judge.
i
mean
it
just
--
it
defies
my
imagination
when
we
see
the
government
acting
in
this
kind
of
totally
high
handed
manner.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
well
in
my
refund
suit
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
i
haven't
gone
ahead
on
the
refund
suit
because
we've
agreed
to
wait
until
there's
an
adjudication
of
this
case
because
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
well
i
didn't
have
to
judge,
but
if
i
didn't
i
was
going
to
get
flora
stuff
down
my
throat.
and
i
would've
been
thrown
out,
and
i
would've
had
nothing.
at
least
this
way
i'm
here
in
front
you
on
what
i
think
is
the
basic
remedy
that's
available
to
me
getting
all
the
money
back
because
the
government
did
not
give
us
the
deficiency
notice
which
is
required
by
law
to
give
us.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
very
likely
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
i
don't
dispute
that
judge.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
but
i
would've
been
thrown
out.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
i
can
only
say
again
your
honor
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
yes,
i
very
well
might
be
your
honor
except
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
well,
i
don't
think
it's
really
an
advisory
opinion
your
honor
in
the
sense
that
i
am
asking
you
to
say
that
the
government
is
required
to
issue
a
deficiency
notice
when
it
makes
a
short
year
termination
under
6851,
and
its
failure
to
make
that
vitiates
their
seizure
of
my
client's
money
and
i'm
trying
to
have
that
in
junction
grant
that
to
return
that
money
to
me.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
no
your
honor,
it
doesn't
but
what
it
does
do
is
it
then
--
if
they
give
me
the
deficiency
notice
now
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
does.
but
if
in
fact
you'll
find
that
they
were
required
to
give
me
a
deficiency
notice
by
statute,
as
a
i
think
they
are,
then
i
think
that
would
compel
the
district
court
judge
to
grant
my
injunction
and
return
the
money
to
me.
i
know
that
court
is
probably
very
reluctant
to
return
the
money,
but
i
do
think
that's
the
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
well,
i
just
--
i
am
certainly
we're
all
interested
in
protection
the
revenue
of
the
united
states
your
honor.
i
as
a
taxpayer
am,
and
--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
i
think
it's
more
than
a
matter
of
omitting
a
statutory
duty
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
goes
beyond
that.
i
think
they've
encroached
upon
a
serious
right
of,
as
a
person,
a
citizen
or
a
non-citizen
who
has
the
same
right
as
a
citizen.
they've
denied
him
any
kind
of
summary
hearing
where
he
can
justify
his
possession
of
that
money
then
deprived
him
of
his
property
for
30
months
your
honor.
for
almost
two
and
a
half
years
thus
far,
without
any
interest
and
maybe
they
pay
6%
of
what
if
something
if
we
gets
it
back.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
man
has
been
really
reduced
to
status
of
poverty
because
of
this
kind
of
action
and
i
think
of
all
the
cases
your
honor
kelly
and
goldberg
and
all
the
rest
of
them
where
this
court
has
said.
there
is
some
kind
of
a
hearing
before
property
right
is
terminated.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
or
at
least
immediately
there
--
i
say
this
maybe
one
of
the
few
very
few
exceptions
your
honor.
and
i'm
in
a
very
untenable
position
that
i
--
my
everything
about
me
cries
out
that
you
can't
take
property
rights
away
from
a
person
without
a
prior
year.
but
in
this
case,
i
think
maybe
there
is
some
justification
because
of
the
fact
that
the
man
was
leaving
the
country
with
the
good
of
money.
but
i
think
that
if
in
fact
this
is
one
of
those
exceptions
that
have
been
recognized
in
other
times,
there
must
be
engrafted
upon
that
kind
of
a
ruling,
a
requirement
that
within
a
meaningful
time
and
place,
he
has
an
opportunity
to
get
an
answer
to
those
three
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
assessment
the
amount
and
the
rest
with
your
honor,
whether
or
not
the
tax
was
under
--
the
money
was
in
the
united
states
and
there
was
in
fact
jeopardy
but
being
removed
from
the
united
states.
this
man,
judge
could
very
well
have
$5
million
in
a
bank
prepared
to
pay
the
tax.
he
doesn't,
but
the
government
doesn't
know
that.
when
you
look
at
a
case
like
when
reniere
which
was
decided
in
new
york,
your
honor,
you
see
that
a
frenchman
was
arrested
in
the
united
states
with
$247,000.00
on
him.
after
46
months,
he
finally
got
a
hearing
and
a
tax
agent
named
mr.
silva
was
asked
on
cross-examination.
what
was
the
basis
for
the
assessment?
and
he
hemmed
and
he
hooed
through
a
number
of
answers,
and
finally
he
was
forced
to
state
that
the
basis
for
the
assessment
was
that
was
the
amount
of
money
they
man
had,
that's
what
he
was
told
to
assess
and
that
what
he
assessed.
and
i
maintain
that
exactly
what
happened
in
my
case.
only
in
my
case
they
took
310
because
there
were
three
people
they
multiplied
it
by
three.
well
if
that
kind
of
convict
can
be
countenanced
on
the
part
of
the
irs
i
maintain
there
are
substantial
due
process
violations.
and
i
think
for
that
reason
if
for
no
other
reason,
this
man
should
be
have
his
money
returned
and
to
be
at
least
granted
a
hearing
within
30
days
of
any
seizure
in
the
future.
because
judge,
among
other
things,
you
are
talking
about
statutes
of
limitations.
one
of
the
things
i
have
to
be
afraid
of
in
this
case
your
honor
is
that
in
fact,
the
money
is
returned
to
me
as
counsel
for
this
man
i
think
the
government
has
the
right
to
re-seize
it.
and
i
mean
that
that
happens
to
be
one
of
the
options
that
i
think
is
available
to
the
government.
the
other
question
you're
talking
about
statutes
of
limitations,
the
government
has
three
years
in
which
to
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency.
that
three
years
has
not
expired
yet.
they
still
have
not
issued
the
notice
to
me.
and
i
think
that
was
another
one
of
the
statutory
questions
you're
asking.
at
this
time
your
honor.
if
i
could
address
myself
briefly
to
the
problem
of
the
statutory
problem
such
as
it
is.
this
short
year
termination
was
made
under
the
aegis
of
6851
of
the
code.
that's
a
provision
as
a
section
of
the
code
entitled
jeopardy
and
6851
as
the
short
year
provision
under
jeopardy.
the
government
claims
that
it
can
go
to
6201
of
the
code
which
is
the
general
assessment
power
and
does
carry
in
at
the
statement
by
stamp
which
may
mean
that
it
can
only
collect
taxes
under
that
section
or
assessed
by
stamp,
but
nonetheless
its
general
assessment
power.
they
go
to
that
for
their
assessment
authority.
they
don't
in
their
brief
“section
(d)”
of
that
particular
statute
which
in
effect
directs
the
section
6201
(d)
specifically
states
for
special
rules
applicable
to
deficiencies
of
income
etcetera
see
subchapter
b.
subchapter
b
being
section
6211
to
6216.
when
you
go
to
section
6216
of
the
code
your
honor,
section
6216
too
they
say
for
procedures
relating
to
jeopardy
assessments
see
subchapter
a
of
chapter
70.
in
effect,
what
we
are
saying
is
the
government
when
you
follow
its
argument
to
its
completion
had
they
included
that
section
(d)
in
their
brief
referring
them
to
section
6216,
you
would
find
that
they'd
make
it
complete
circle.
they
start
under
the
jeopardy
assessment
provisions
of
chapter
70
subtitle
a.
they
go
to
6201,
they
get
sent
to
6216
which
sends
them
back
to
chapter
70.
i
think
that
its
pretty
obvious
that
they
have
to
if
they're
going
to
make
an
assessment
under
6251
it
has
to
be
done
under
the
authority
of
6261
--
6861,
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
now
why
don't
they
want
will
assess
under
6861
which
is
the
net
following
statute.
they
terminate
the
short
year
under
6851
but
they
don't
have
the
authority
to
assess
under
that.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
absolutely
judge.
i
don't
in
any
way
say
that
because
if
follows
it
invariable
means
that
it
has
to
be
applied
but
judge,
when
you
look
at
it,
both
of
them
under
the
jeopardy
had,
both
of
them
concerning
jeopardy
assessments,
they're
being
no
other
sections
concerning
jeopardy
assessments.
i
think
you'd
have
to
be
somewhat
blinded
not
feel
there
must
be
some
correlation
between
the
two
of
them.
and
practically
your
honor,
if
in
fact
the
government
doesn't
use
6861
there
in
effect
avoiding
the
necessity
of
giving
the
taxpayer
a
deficiency
notice
which
allows
him
to
go
into
the
tax
court
for
adjudication.
and
that's
exactly
why
they
don't
want
to
use
6861.
they
had
much
rather
take
a
taxpayer
assets
and
deny
him
the
rights
to
go
the
tax
court
for
any
kind
of
pre-payment
or
any
kind
or
even
post-payment
decision.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
if
you
have
a
way
into
the
tax
court?
well
your
honor,
if
again
in
short
year
jeopardy
assessment,
it's
my
feeling
that
they
can
assess
but
they
cannot
distrain
they
may
levy,
but
they
can't
distrain,
i
don't
think
they
can
sell
the
property.
they
maybe
able
to
take
the
property
provided
the
due
process
requirements
are
granted
by
giving
you
an
immediate
or
at
least
the
reasonable
hearing
in
a
meaningful
time
and
place
and
manner
so
that
you
can
have
a
determination
by
a
judicial
officer
as
to
the
validity
of
this
whole
thing.
you
see
your
honor,
the
difference
in
this
particular
case,
this
type
of
situation
is
that
this
is
a
totally
capricious
and
arbitrary
act
by
the
commissioner,
and
it's
done
generally
in
cases
involving
a
means
of
punishing
people
who
are
suspected
of
drug
dealings
or
gambling.
it's
not
a
bona
fide
attempt
to
collect
a
tax
because
if
in
fact
it
was,
and
i
can't
speak
for
my
brother,
mrs.
hall
is
a
very
inoffensive
young
little
lady
sitting
there
in
a
rented
house
with
little
volkswagen.
she's
not
hurting
anybody,
they
don't
have
to
destroy
her
at
the
collective
tax
and
i
think
that
this
is
when
you
see
in
fact
that
it's
really
a
means
of
law
enforcement
of
punishment
not
a
means
of
obtaining
revenue
for
the
government
you
then
see
then
the
necessity
for
putting
an
impartial
magistrate
between
the
government
and
the
citizenry
of
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
don't
dispute
that
at
all
your
honor,
i
just
say
if
that
is
true,
if
in
fact
that's
true,
there's
no
reason
why
they
couldn't
seize
the
rest,
seize
the
money
and
hold
it
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
30
days,
20
days
some
such
time
where
they
have
to
go
before
a
judge,
all
i
want
is
a
judge,
somebody
who
can
sit
there
and
say
“look
fellows,
you
are
not
acting
in
accordance
with
the
constitutional
standards
of
the
united
states.”
when
you
have
to
go
to
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
who
maybe
a
great
guy
i
don't
even
know
his
name.
he
maybe
a
wonderful
man,
but
he
still
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
and
he
still
a
law
enforcement
officer
and
he
still
helping
enforce
a
situation
that
in
fact
may
well
have
terminated
by
now,
but
he
still
law
enforcement
and
when
this
law
enforcement
on
one
side
there
is
no
impartial
determination.
the
way
i
see
things
in
light
of
best
interest
of
my
client,
he
sees
in
the
best
interest
of
the
government.
give
me
a
fellow
on
a
black
robe
who
has
no
interest
who
merely
wants
to
see
justice
done
in
the
abstract,
and
i
think
we've
got
what
this
country
is
all
about.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
addressing
myself,
if
i
may,
to
mr.
laing’s
situation,
mr.
laing
is
a
foreign
national
who
has
been
in
this
country
24
days
at
the
time
of
this
event.
he
comes
in
by
vehicle
on
a
b2
visa
from
canada
to
new
york.
he
is
leaving
by
motor
vehicle
from
new
york
to
canada.
he
is
turned
back
at
the
border
and
american
officials
searched
his
car
even
though
he
had
left
and
only
been
gone
five
minutes.
when
he
makes
the
swing,
they
searched
his
car.
they
find,
your
honor,
a
suitcase
with
$300,000
in
the
motor
of
his
automobile.
this
is
occasion
to
certain
degree
of
skepticism
and
shock
on
the
part
of
people
who
hear
this
particular
thing
but
i
ask,
your
honor,
considering
in
a
jeopardy
frame
work,
where
do
you
carry
$300,000
on
a
500
mile
auto
trip
in
the
middle
of
the
night?
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
well,
your
honor,
you
may
do
that
because
you
have
credentials
to--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
that
may
be
true,
your
honor,
but
what
i
am
saying,
in
effect,
judges,
i
am
referring
to
the
situation
as
we
have
it,
cash,
judge.
and
there
are
people,
your
honor,
who
deal
in
nothing
but
cash
for
their
own
idiosyncratic
reasons
and
i
do
not
know
what
those--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
your
honor,
i
cannot
say
they
are
dishonest.
i
know
gamblers
who
deal
in
large
amounts
of
money
who
pay
their
taxes
every
year,
and
i
do
not
think
this
case
should
be
decided
on
the
fact
that
the
money
was
in
a
suitcase
in
the
motor
block
of
an
automobile.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
no,
your
honor,
for
one
reason,
judge,
and
i
say
this
only
because
one
of
the
other
court
member
this
morning
pointed
out
something.
we
are
assuming
one
thing.
we
are
assuming
that
mr.
laing
is
a
taxpayer.
that
is
the
assumption
that
we
seem
to
have
neglected
to
fight
in
this
case.
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
and
that
is
the
constitutional
problem
i
face
also,
that
mr.
laing
is
a
taxpayer
in
the
united
states,
your
honor.
anymore
evidence
than
there
would
be
if
when
this
court
was
in
paris
this
summer.
upon
leaving,
you
happen
to
have
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
in
cash
in
your
pocket.
you
were
searched
and
that
money
seized.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
no,
your
honor.
what
the
government
has
done
is
the
government
has
assumed
that
he
is
a
taxpayer
and
taken
his
money
and
treated
him
this
way.
one
of
my
basic
arguments
and
in
an
effort
to
keep
within
a
time
frame
for
this
court
i
am
going
to
basically
stay
away
from
the
code
arguments,
your
honor,
just
to
address
myself
if
i
can
to
the
constitutional
issues.
one
of
the
basic
arguments,
judges,
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
he
was
a
taxpayer.
now,
when
you
read
the
case,
your
honor,
when
you
read
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
in
the
appendices
you
find
that
he
got
stopped
at
the
border
at
2
a.m.
mr.
fields,
who
was
the
district
director
of
vermont
was
called
by
customs
at
2
a.m.
and
it
is
right
in
the
appendix,
your
honor,
and
his
deposition
and
testimony.
and,
he
says
he
said
to
the
customs
man
“how
long
can
you
keep
him?”
the
customs
man
said
“i
can
hold
him
for
two
hours
but
if
you
send
somebody
here,
i
will
keep
him
until
they
get
here.”
at
10
o'
clock,
the
next
morning,
your
honor,
eight
hours
later,
mr.
laing
is
sitting
in
a
room
of
a
derby
line,
vermont
being
held
waiting
for
irs
people.
at
10
o'
clock
in
the
morning,
two
irs
people
show
up
and
they
talk
to
mr.
laing
and
they
talk
to
the
other
two
people.
and,
i
think
this
is
of
key
importance,
your
honor.
they
talk
to
all
three
people.
the
other
two
people
disclaimed
any
knowledge
of
the
money.
laing
claims
knowledge
of
the
money
and
ownership
of
the
money.
the
irs
then
assesses,
your
honor,
a
$310,000
jeopardy
assessment
at
seizure
against
each
of
the
three
people.
they
assessed
$930,000
in
taxes
even
though
they
only
seized
$310,000.
your
honor,
later
on,
we
want
to
file
a
suit
for
a
refund
figuring
“all
right,
fellows,
you
owe
us
$150,000.
give
us
back
half
the
money.”
we
file
a
claim
for
a
refund,
judge,
and
we
find
out
that
they
went
even
further
than
that.
on
their
own
initiative
with
no
notice
to
anyone,
the
irs
is
now
gone
and
they
have
taken
the
$310,000
that
they
have
assessed
each
person
and
they
have
distributed
the
$310,000
they
seized.
they
gave
each
person
credit
for
$100,000
and
then
they,
very
graciously,
cut
the
assessment
from
300
to
200,
but
we
still
owe
them
$100,000
so
we
cannot
bring
the
refund
suit.
now,
we
are
in
a
position
where
it
is
our
money.
we
admit
it
is
our
money
and
we
say
it
is
our
$300.
we
file
for
a
refund
to
the
commissioner.
we
say
“give
us
back
$150,000
and
we
will
fight
over
whether
or
not
i
am
a
taxpayer,”
but
they
will
not
even
let
us
do
that.
now,
your
honor,
there
has
been
some
conversation
and
questioning
this
morning
concerning
the
fact
that
we
have
a
right
to
a
suit
for
refund.
but,
your
honor,
there
are
two
things
involved.
the
time
span
is
a
minimum
of
6
months
and
a
maximum
of
18
months
on
a
suit
for
refund.
for
example,
if
the
commissioner
terminates
a
year
on
january
2,
1975.
they
terminate
a
tax
year.
you
then
have
to
wait
until
the
conclusion
of
1975
to
file
for
your
refund
twelve
months.
you
then
file
and
the
commissioner
can
sit
back
and
wait
six
months.
so,
you
have
18
months.
in
our
case,
the
tax
year
was
terminated
on
june
24th.
nine
months
later
in
march,
after
much
negotiation,
we
filed
for
the
refund
and,
grant
that
it
was
denied
within
eight
days,
but
we
still
had
a
nine-month
wait.
in
fact,
your
honor,
what
is
available
to
my
client,
to
this
foreign
national?
he
does
not
have
available
to
him
a
refund
suit
as
a
practical
matter,
because
of
the
rule
of
flora
case,
and
not
full
payment
rule.
secondly,
my
client
is
being
discriminated
against,
i
think,
invidiously
and
that
he
has
to
make
full
payment
and
is
denied
access
to
the
non-prepayment
forum,
the
tax
court,
which
is
where
we
want
to
go.
why
is
he
denied
or
how
was
he
denied
access
to
the
tax
court?
very
simply,
the
government
will
not
issue
a
deficiency
notice.
mr.
justice
white
asked
today,
why
do
they
want
an
assessment?
i
think
they
want
assessments
so
they
can
then
say
there
is
a
deficiency.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
i
think
it
is,
judge.
i
think
when
reading
the
statute--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
well,
i
cannot
say
that
i
find
it
in
any
specific
statute,
your
honor.
but,
again,
in
reading
the
code--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
yes,
your
honor,
it
is,
in
6211.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
condition--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
right,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
wonderful.
i
have
been
trapped--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
your
honor,
i
will
exceed
to
that
in
a
moment.
i
have
been
trapped
like
most
lawyers
into
arguing
oh
the
irs
grounds
because
of
a
basic
unfamiliarity
with
the
irs
codes,
and
i
bought
the
idea
that
you
need
an
assessment
and
i
fought
the
irs
argument--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
well,
your
honor,
in
that
particular
situation
that
there
is
no
problem--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
no
question
i
needed
what
they
call
a
90-day
notice,
your
honor,
or
a
letter
of
deficiency
to
get
into
the
tax
court
and
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
that
in
this
particular
case
because
in
either
case,
whether
you
need
an
assessment
or
you
do
not
need
an
assessment,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
is
a
deficiency
here.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
they
told
me
“you
owe
$195,985.
85,”
your
honor,
and
my
man
is--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
all
it
takes,
your
honor--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
i
think
because
it
is
not
the
statutory
notice
that
is
required
by
the
courts,
your
honor.
well
quite
frankly,
your
honor,
again,
i
am
fighting
them
on
their
own
grounds
and
i
have
gone
for
the
abate
instead
of
fighting
on
the
grounds
that,
in
effect,
there
is
a
deficiency
created
by
the
very
fact
that
6851
was
filed.
but
again,
your
honor,
if
i
go
for
that
and
i
do
now
petition
the
tax
court
without
a
ruling
from
you,
i
will
probably
be
thrown
out
on
a
jurisdictional
grounds
in
the
tax
court
and
have
to
be
back
here
again
in
a
year,
if
you
allow
me
to
try
to
convince
you
that
this
revenue
has
been
foreclosed
to
me.
my
biggest
problem,
judge,
on
a
constitutional
basis
basically
is
that
i
have
a
foreign
national
who
has
his
money
taken
away
from
him
and
he
has
nowhere
to
go.
do
you
realize
that
uptil
today,
three
years
and
four
months
or
three
years
and
four
months
after
the
seizure
there
has
still
been
no
assessment
or
putting
aside
or
any
kind
of
letter
issued.
my
man’s
money
is
sitting
some
place
in
the
government.
i
have
petitioned
to
have
it
placed
in
an
interest
bearing
account
and
pay
the
man
the
interest.
he
is
still
living
on
the
houseboat
in
wales
without
any
money.
i
have
been
trying
to
get
an
income
from
the
$300,000.
they
will
not
do
it.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
no,
he
is
back
in
wales.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
yes,
your
honor,
still
has
no
money
so
he
calls
me
collect,
your
honor.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that,
in
this
particular
case,
constitutional
rights
that
are
guaranteed
to
american
citizens,
the
rights
of
access
to
a
court
have
been
denied
to
this
man
and,
most
importantly,
judge--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
what
i
said
for
laing.
just
think,
your
honor,
in
this
particular
case
you
cannot
terminate
a
probation
without
a
hearing.
you
cannot
start
to
take
away
a
welfare
check
without
a
hearing.
you
cannot
condemn
obscene
material
without
a
prior
hearing.
but
in
my
particular
man’s
case,
whether
there
is
any
adjudication
prior
to
the
fact
that
the
money
is
seized
that
he
is
a
taxpayer,
he
is
taking
his
money
that
was
taken
away
from
him.
if
i
concede
arguendo
only
that
because
of
the
peculiar
nature
of
this
case
perhaps
the
government
had
a
right
to
hold
that
money
for
a
short
period
of
time.
well,
there
was
a
determination
but,
your
honor,
three
years
and
four
months
with
no
action
whatsoever
by
the
government
to
demonstrate
to
any
kind
of
an
impartial
judicial
body
that,
in
fact,
there
was
justification
for
the
seizure
by
the
fact
that
this
man
was
a
taxpayer
seems
to
me
to
fly
in
the
face
of
all
our
constitutional
guarantees
and
due
process.
and
even
further,
your
honor,
the
fact
that
my
man
not
only
has
lost
the
use
of
the
money
but
my
man
does
not
have
any
forum
readily
available
to
him
to
determine
that
the
money
should
not
be
paid
to
the
government
anyway.
we
are
in
a
position
where
we
have
nowhere
to
go.
we
cannot
go
on
the
refund
suit
because
of
the
flora
rule.
we
cannot
go
to
the
tax
court
because
of
the
no
deficiency,
and
we
cannot
get
any
kind
of
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
government
has
the
right
to
assess
taxes
and
seize
money
on
totally
specious
basis.
going
back
to
that
mr.
perry,
your
honor,
who
was
the
internal
revenue
agent
who
came
to
derby
laing
where
my
man
was
with
the
money.
when
he
came
there,
your
honor,
he
set
$310,000,
the
exact
amount
of
money
that
was
seized
as
the
tax
on
(inaudible).
now,
we
and
talk
we
had
a
deposition
with
him.
we
could
not
go
into
how
we
set
it,
only
generally.
but
in
raneri
(ph),
your
honor,
which
is
a
southern
district
of
new
york
case
which
i
am
sure
you
are
familiar
with.
a
frenchman
was
arrested
at
kennedy
airport
with
$247,850
on
this
person.
the
irs
was
called
in.
the
irs
set
a
tax
of
$247,500.
they
left
him
$320
and
seized
his
money.
when
the
agent,
mr.
vida,
was
on
the
witness
stand
in
new
york
at
the
hearing
which
was
granted
by
a
district
court
judge,
they
went
into
how
the
assessment
was
made,
and
the
attorney
for
the
raneri
(ph)
asked
the
agent,
“in
fact,
sir,
were
you
not
sent
there
for
the
specific
purpose
of
seizing
the
exact
amount
of
money
that
was
found?”
and
he
said
“yes.”
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
my
case,
your
honor,
because
that
is
what
happened
to
me.
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
well,
your
honor,
that
is
part
of--
mr.
joseph
s.
oteri
well,
your
honor,
that
is
part
of
the
record
in
my
case.
i
direct
you
to
mr.
perry
to
show
you
that
that
is
how
the
assessments
are
made,
to
point
out
to
you
that,
again,
we
are
being
deprived
of
a
constitutional
right
which
we
have,
the
right
to
some
kind
of
a
speedy
determination
of
this
particular
type
of
tax
in
this
particular
type
of
situation.
thank
you,
your
honor.
