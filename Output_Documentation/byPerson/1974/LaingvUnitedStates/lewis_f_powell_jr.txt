justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
smith,
as
i
understand
your
position
you
are
saying
that
when
a
government
precedes
under
6851
the
taxpayer
should
not
have
the
normal
action
going
either
to
the
district
court
after
he
paid
the
tax
or
going
immediately
to
the
tax
court
itself.
what
reason
and
policy
or
otherwise
is
that
for
denying
that
option
to
taxpayers
who've
been
preceded
against
under
6851?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
in
line
of
that
it
should
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
i
retain
to
the
question
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked.
in
what
way
would
the
government
be
prejudiced
if
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit
reading
blending
these
two
statutes
together
where
construed
by
the
commissioner
to
be
the
correct
interpretation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
smith
that
is
very
clear
in
the
laing
case
for
example
where
money
was
about
to
be
transported
in
the
united
states.
is
it
equally
cleat
to
you
in
whole
case
where
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
was
the
commissioner
i
had
read
that
someone
had
burglarized
say
a
liquor
store
or
a
grocery
store
and
made
off
with
$10,000.00
or
bank,
would
that
justify
in
the
sense?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
mr.
smith?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
really
realistic
to
suggest
that
a
taxpayer
like
mrs.
hall
has
a
remedy
which
is
based
on
her
paying
the
deficiency,
in
this
case
$52,000.00
when
the
government
has
assessed
--
has
made
a
levy
on
all
of
her
known
assets,
arguably
she
mighty
get
a
bond
and
release
them
but
the
likelihood
of
one
and
have
plight
getting
a
bond
is
not
terribly
bright
is
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
she
really
didn't
have
to
pay
$52,000.00
to
get
in
the
court
though
to
bring
it
here.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
heavrin?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
familiar
with
clark
against
camel?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
decided
recently
by
the
fifth
circuit.
the
court
in
that
case
addressing
this
very
issue
expressly
said
that
the
government
did
have
the
right,
under
the
circumstances
you've
described,
to
continue
to
hold
the
taxpayers
property
in
an
amount
sufficient
to
cover
the
assessed
deficiency.
do
you
disagree
with
that?
