chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
73-1808,
laing
against
the
united
states
and
74-75
united
states
against
hall,
the
two
cases
being
consolidated.
mr.
smith
before
you
proceed
let
me
announce
that
through
mr.
justice
david
marshall
is
unavoidably
delayed
in
getting
here
due
to
the
weather
conditions
of
the
roads
and
he
will
participate
in
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
tapes
up
to
the
time
that
he
actually
arrives.
you
may
proceed,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
leave
that,
trace
out
the
steps
of
the
remedy
in
the
district
court.
what
must
the
taxpayer
do
before
he
can
assert
a
remedy
on
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
he
files
a
claim
for
refund
there
must
be
something
on
which
the
refund
can
operate
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
if
your
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
thought
that
you
could
reach
this
money
by
this
other
process
that
we
wouldn't
have
any
more
than
academic
controversy
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
let's
assume
for
a
moment
hypothetically
that
these
intonations
are
correct
that
your
condition
of
deficiency
notice
now
and
that
they
could
go
into
the
tax
court,
them
is
the
government
--
would
the
government
be
harmed
or
would
the
taxpayers
be
benefited
anymore?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
would
the
money
be
in
the
mean
time,
the
amount
of
money?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
be
a
declaratory
judgment
in
this
context
or
would
that
be
an
essential
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
meant
advisory
rather
than
declaratory.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
heavrin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
find
that
trap
description
a
little
bit
opaque.
do
you
mean
that
the
informants
informed
the
police
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
then
the
police
informed
the
internal
revenue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
concealed
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
bring
this
down
to
where
you
are
with
the
volkswagen.
you
hypothesized
that
they
sold
for
a
thousand
dollars
and
the
government
has
a
thousand.
if
you
prevail
here
would
that
be
your
claim
that
you
are
entitled
to
get
that
thousand
dollars
back
or
only
that
future
property
could
not
be
distraint?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
would
that
be
added
to
your
constitutional
argument
if
the
government
can
hold
the
money
the
property
which
is
already
seized?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
am
i
to
take
that
response
as
meaning
yes
the
government
can
continue
to
hold
what
it
seized
that
can't
seize
anything
additional?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
does
the
amount
stay
there
or
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you're
still
leaving
me
doubt
if
that's
answer
is.
the
status
quo
is
that
the
government
is
got
a
bond
for
sum
of
money.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
her
car.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
stands
in
the
place
of
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
status
quo
continue
until
the
end
of
the
litigation
if
you
prevail
or
must
the
bond
be
dissolved?
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
put
at.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
--
well
perhaps
we'll
hear
something
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
about
that
from
your
friends.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
heavrin.
mr.
oteri.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
otherwise
there
wouldn't
be
really
much
point
in
your
being
here
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
wouldn't
be
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
to
all
these
trouble
over
just
whether
--
over
purely
legal
points
at
this
stage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
this
money
in
your
hands
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
so
that
the
client's
free
to
do
with
it
whatever
he
wants
to
do
with
it,
including
taking
it
to
zurich
or
atowa?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
at
that
stage
was
he
in
possession
of
sufficient
facts
to
determine
which
potential
taxpayer
owned
how
much
and
owed
how
much
taxes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
let's
back
up
a
minute
here
when
you
speak
of
these
concessions
by
laing
that
it
was
all
his
money
and
therefore
by
implication
all
his
tax
liability
if
any.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
would
the
government
be
if
later
on
the
other
two
people
came
in
for
litigation
and
said,
“oh
no,
it's
ours
and
it's
our
money
and
if
any
are
tax
liability.”
do
you
suggest
that
the
governments
bound
by
a
concession
made
by
mr.
liang
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
you
tell
me
again
why
you
haven't
gone
ahead
with
a
trial
with
the
case
in
the
district
court
in
vermont?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
didn't
have
to
agree,
did
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
go
back.
you
could
have
put
this
case
on
the
calendar
for
trial
and
forced
the
trial
in
the
vermont
district
court
long
since,
it's
probably
the
latest
court
calendar.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
any
district
court
in
the
whole
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you're
assuming
that.
well
i'm
not
assuming
it
your
honor.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
had
you
gone
in,
we
would
know
that
and
you
might
be
here
on
that
route.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
instead
of
now
seeking
an
advisory
opinion
from
the
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
giving
of
that
deficiency
notice
require
that
the
government
return
the
money
to
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
oteri.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
smith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
consolidated
cases
1808
and
7475,
laing
v.
united
states
and
united
states
v.
hall.
mr.
smith,
i
think
the
clerk
has
indicated
to
you
that,
since
the
case
has
been
argued
before,
we
hope
that
counsel
will
be
able
to
present
the
consolidated
cases
in
less
than
the
total
of
two
hours.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
has
a
chance
to
explore
all
these
things,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
you
are
saying
that
he
has
not
been
deprived
of
a
proper
determination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
heavrin,
will
you
and
your
colleague
adjust
your
time
to
35
minutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
do
you
not
get
on
with
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
this
in
the
record
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
i
suggest
you
restrain.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
confine
yourself
to
the
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
oteri.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
jeopardy
assessment
structure
of
the
statutes
is
aimed
at
precisely
this
kind
of
situation
and
among
many
others
like
it,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
that
the
assumption
of
this
case
was
that
he
ought
to
be
a
taxpayer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
are
you
arguing
his
case
or
yours?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suggest,
again,
you
confine
yourself
to
the
record
of
this
case,
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
wasting
your
valuable
time
outside
the
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
marshall
has
two
consolidated
case
opinions
two
announce.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
marshall.
