justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
relief
he
sought
then
in
the
district
court
was
not
simply
to
require
you
to
issue
a
deficiency
notice
but
actually
return
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
made
a
claim
not
a
suit,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
hall's
position
is
a
little
bit
different
in
mr.
laing's,
isn't
it
in
that
regard?
because
as
i
understood
the
amount
assessed
against
her
was
considerably
more
than
the
value
of
what
was
seized.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
good
argument
can
be
made
certainly
that
is
the
only
form
for
someone
who
can't
pay
all
the
amount
of
the
assessment
under
the
flora
case,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nobody
is
questioning
that
as
i
understand
it.
aren't
there
revenues
adequately
protected
by
the
commissioner's
power
to
summarily
levy
and
keep
in
his
possession
this
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
in
laing
though,
a
guy
going
across
the
boarder
with
$300,000.00
in
the
engine
compartment,
i
would
think
that
would
justify
that
sort
of
an
assessment
perhaps
ever
two
years
after
you
found
him
doing
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
let
me
interrupt
you
with
one
more
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position
that
you
need
not
or
that
you
are
not
even
authorize
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
did
6201
first
come
into
play?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
1918?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stuart
smith.
the
language
in
6851
that
set
forth
on
page
60
of
your
brief,
the
last
two
lines
on
page
60
it
talks
about
effectual
proceedings
to
collect
the
in
contacts.
now
on
the
next
line
on
page
61,
unless
such
proceedings
your
view
then
would
be
that
the
word
proceedings
reviews
to
--
refers
to
proceedings
under
6201.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
under
6851
you've
already
levied.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
6331
starts
up
by
seeing
pay
this
in
within
ten
days.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
heavrin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
it
be
true
whether
you
get
into
the
tax
court
or
the
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
so
that
in
the
case
of
your
fellow
well
a
petitioner
in
that
case
mr.
laing
he
would
then
get
the
$300,000.00
and
the
suitcase
back
while
the
tax
deficiency
has
been
determined.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
read
the
sixth
circuit
opinion
and
where
they
ruled
in
your
clients
favor
is
simply
saying
that
government
had
to
issue
and
notice
that
deficiencies
and
not
going
on
to
say
that
your
client
was
entitled
to
relief
from
distraint
there.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt
your
replenish
but
i
thought
your
argument
are
the
one
that
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
acquitted,
you're
arguing
as
a
statutory
matter
that
the
property
should
be
returned
--
that
the
distraint
should
be
relieved.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
–
i
may
have
interrupted
mr.
justice
blackmun
let
me
make
this
observation
to
you.
i
think
you
probably
sense
during
mr.
smith's
argument
a
feeling
on
the
part
of
several
members
of
the
court
that
if
the
revenue
is
more
than
jeopardy
and
all
we
were
talking
about
was
a
notice
of
deficiency
in
a
fairly
close
legal
question,
if
the
government
wasn't
prejudice
and
the
taxpayer
would
be
denied
and
after
they
litigate,
there
was
some
reason
on
the
close
case
to
resolve
that
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer.
but
now
you're
in
effect
arguing
that
the
revenues
will
be
in
jeopardy
that
this
man
who
had
$300,000.00
in
this
suitcase
or
in
the
engine
compartment
will
just
be
free
to
leave
the
country
until
his
tax
determination
is
finally
determined
that
was
the
equities
in
quite
a
different
position.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
we
also
stipulate
that
no
one
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are,
you're
saying?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
that
philip's
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
philip's
uphold
substantially
the
kind
of
proceedings
we
have
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
true
of
the
whole
body
of
tax
law.
you
have
duplicate
adjudication
two
systems
of
adjudication
of
tax
law,
one
on
the
district
courts
and
one
on
the
tax
court.
i
mean
that's
not
peculiar
to
your
situation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
he
says
“why
won't
you
supra
refund?”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
government
says
now
that
its
view
of
flora
is
that
you
got
a
perfect
right
to
supra
refund.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
you
say
its
the
next
following
stats
does
have
a
provision
in
the
code,
isn't
that
says
the
judge
to
position
of
sections
after
all
this
revisions
since
to
be
given
any
great
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
of
course
your
client's
case
quite
different
from
mrs.
hall's
perhaps
does
suggest
that
the
government
may
have
been
motivated
by
desire
to
protect
the
revenues
i
would
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
a
six-month
delay,
as
permitted
by
statute,
would
be
unconstitutional
but
that,
in
fact,
the
amount
of
time
taken
here
was
within
permissible
bonds.
what
should
our
ruling
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
we
ever
be
confronted
with
that
if,
in
fact,
this
did
not
take
six
months?
do
we
pass
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutes
in
the
abstract?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
do
not
suggest
that
some
that
some
citizens
are
not
to
have
a
fear
of
the
irs,
do
you?
certainly,
some
of
them
should.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
a
guy
who
has
been
dodging
taxes
for
the
last
20
years
and
the
irs
is--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
he
not
be
very
likely
in
fear
of
the
irs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
your
statement--
