(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
am
i
right
that
congress,
or
at
least
the
house
ways
and
means
committee,
is
contemplating
changing
this
whole
thing?
unknown
speaker
there
is
one
of
the
house
ways
and
means
committee?
unknown
speaker
he
has
never
before
been
a
taxpayer
in
the
united
states,
has
he?
unknown
speaker
in
his
whole
life,
he
has
been
in
our
country
25
days,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
as
far
as
the
record
shows?
unknown
speaker
it
could
have
been.
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
i
want
to
be
sure.
was
your
net
worth
computation
based
on
25
days
expanded
to
the
full
year
or
was
this
regarded
in
mr.
laing’s
case
as
the
entire
income
in
quotations
for
the
year?
do
you
know?
unknown
speaker
how
on
earth
could
they
do
that
except
by
just
arbitrarily
find?
unknown
speaker
somebody
has
been,
so
far
as
we
know,
they
have
been
in
this
country
only
25
days,
he
has
lived
in
new
zealand.
he
comes
from
new
zealand.
how
do
they
know
his
opening
net
worth
is
zero
or
how
can
they
assume
it
except--?
unknown
speaker
normally,
the
ground
rules
apply
to
non-resident
taxpayer.
unknown
speaker
you
named
him
a
taxpayer.
we
do
not
even
know
he
is
a
taxpayer.
unknown
speaker
ever
until--
unknown
speaker
maybe
they
do
things
differently
in
new
zealand.
unknown
speaker
they
may
be
bandits
along
the
road.
unknown
speaker
in
any
event,
the
basic
validity
of
the
termination
provisions
are
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
an
issue
with
laing.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
was
some
question
that
there
might
be
some
constitutional
issues?
unknown
speaker
you
should
not
say
that
they
are
subject
to
question
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
only
on
a
constitutional
basis.
unknown
speaker
it
simply
announced
to
setting
up
an
account
against
the
taxpayer
at
a
certain
amount
in
favor
of
the
government
against
the
taxpayer.
isn't
that
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
did
not
make
it
expressly,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
make
it
expressly,
did
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
answer
must
be
no.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
word
like
“jeopardy”
in
6851?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
about
if
you
make
a
jeopardy
assessment?
unknown
speaker
if
you
make
a
jeopardy
assessment,
all
you
do
is
declare
the
tax
immediately
due
and
payable.
unknown
speaker
but
your
authority
to
seize
property
is
still
under
6331,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
61?
unknown
speaker
that
is
right.
unknown
speaker
but
it
does.
it
says
it
is
due
and
payable.
unknown
speaker
the
only
reason
you
could
use
6331
is
because
there
is
something
that
is
due
and
payable.
unknown
speaker
only
until
the
commissioner
terminates
his
years.
unknown
speaker
and
they
become
then
due
and
payable.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
every
time
there
is
an
assessment
and
the
assessment
is
valid,
that
there
is
a
deficiency?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
mean
as
defined
under
the
statute
and
the
regulations.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
balance
of
a
tax.
unknown
speaker
even
if
there
has
been
no
return
filed?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
not
much
artificial
about
it.
he
says--
unknown
speaker
there
is
some
tax
due
and
payable
and
i
am
seizing
$190,000
worth
of
your
money.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean
by
artificial?
unknown
speaker
under
that
provision,
you
can
a
levy
while
the
taxpayer
receives
a
fund
but
you
might
be
able
to
levy
it
but
you
cannot
sell
it.
unknown
speaker
that
it
finally
seized
itself?
unknown
speaker
why
is
there
argument
about
the
assessment
authority?
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
just
hold
on
for
a
moment.
why
does
he
not
have
assessment
authority?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
6331
says
that
this
gives
him
power
to
collect
and
it
just
said
the
tax
is
due
and
payable,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
what
i
want
to
know.
unknown
speaker
there
is
another
provision
within
6851
says
taxes
shall
become
immediately
due
and
payable.
unknown
speaker
and
6331
says
any
tax
that
is
due
and
payable
is
collateral.
now,
why
do
you
need
an
assessment?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
are
restating
your--
unknown
speaker
mr.
smith,
i
have
one.
are
you
going
to
make
any
comment
at
all
on
the
suggestion
of
unconstitutionality
by
your
opponents?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
how
long
does
he
have
to
wait?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
think,
six
months
in
time?
unknown
speaker
let
me
put
it
exactly,
as
long
as
he
does
it
voluntarily.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
you
can
say
is,
does
that
not
make
any
difference
in
the
tax
court
to
be
exposed?
unknown
speaker
so
your
six-month
provision
is
the
statutory
one
and
the
i
suppose
there
is
a
practical
matter
if
a
tax
court
case
is
assigned
to
the
field
that
the
taxpayer’
request.
it
may
sit
there
for
a
year,
may
it
not,
before
it
is
heard
or
close
to
it?
unknown
speaker
and,
of
course,
he
often
does
not
act
all.
unknown
speaker
at
least
it
is
a
congressional
determination.
unknown
speaker
what
about
hall?
unknown
speaker
but
you
did
not
sell
her
car.
unknown
speaker
you
have
your
bond.
unknown
speaker
it
must
be
a
pretty
ancient
volkswagen.
unknown
speaker
mr.
oteri,
is
it
in
this
particular
notice
and
is
it
in
their
notice
the
sense
of
time?
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
find
it?
unknown
speaker
all
of
the
deficiency
is
defined.
unknown
speaker
does
it
mention
where
it
says?
unknown
speaker
so
all
it
talks
about
is
how
much
does
he
owe.
unknown
speaker
and
if
his
balance
is
owing,
then
he
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
i
do
not
know
why
you
keep
giving
the
argument
about
the
sources
of
assessment.
what
6851
states
is
tax
shall
be
due
at
that
time.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
need
an
assessment?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
when
they
taxed
you
did
they
told
you,
you
owe
them
$195--?
unknown
speaker
all
it
takes
is
a
notice
of
deficiency.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
and
if
in
each
case
you
owe
some
taxes
and,
furthermore,
you
owe
$190,000.
now,
why
is
it
that
goes,
because
of
what
is
in
the
forum?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
was
down
in
new
zealand?
unknown
speaker
he
is
in
wales
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
are
claiming
constitutional
rights
for
your
man
too.
