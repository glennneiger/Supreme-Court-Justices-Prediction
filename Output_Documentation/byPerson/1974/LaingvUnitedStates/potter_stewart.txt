but
with
an
explicit
exception?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
is
whether
that
exception
is
acceptable
here.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
at
the
outset,
i
think
the
court
should
bear
in
mind
an
important
historical
fact
about
how
our
present
system
of
tax
litigation
has
developed.
the
tax
court
which
was
established
by
congress
as
the
board
of
tax
appeals
only
in
1924
and
the
united
states
government
has
been
collecting
taxes
for
more
than
a
hundred
years.
now
for
over
--
for
perhaps
the
last
125
years,
the
treasury
has
been
empowered
to
assess
and
collect
certain
taxes
like
excise
taxes
prior
to
the
time
they
are
due
to
be
paid
just
the
way
the
termination
provision
works
here
with
respect
to
income
taxes.
now
coupled
with
the
anti-injunction
act,
a
taxpayer
subject
to
a
termination
or
excise
taxes
cannot
bring
a
suit
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
those
taxes
and
because
of
congress'
decision
that
excise
taxes
are
not
adjudicable
in
the
board
of
tax
appeals
but
only
in
the
district
court.
the
taxpayers
are
limited
to
a
refund
suit
of
the
amount
collected.
now,
we
think
that
the
issue
here
represents
very
much
the
same
sort
of
thing.
a
congressional
decision
very
much
like
the
congressional
decision
to
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tax
court
to
income,
estate,
and
gift
taxes
that
there
has
been
a
congressional
decision
here
which
the
statutory
history
demonstrates
not
to
permit
the
tax
court
to
review
assessments
made
by
the
commissioner
in
connection
with
a
terminated
taxable
period.
in
fact,
that
is
still
the
law
today
with
respect
to
excise
taxes
as
section
6862
of
the
code
so
provides.
now,
the
facts
are
in
the
cases
are
somewhat
parallel
and
are
undisputed
and
can
be
stated
briefly
as
follows.
in
the
laing
case
73-1808,
the
taxpayer
laing
is
a
citizen
of
new
zealand.
in
may
of
1972,
he
entered
the
united
states
from
canada
on
a
temporary
visitor's
visa.
in
late
june,
he
was
traveling
with
two
companions
in
a
rented
automobile
from
northern
united
states
in
vermont
and
attempting
to
get
into
canada.
because
the
canadian
officials
were
dissatisfied
with
the
identification
proffered
by
one
of
the
passengers
they
were
refused
entry
into
canada.
they
then
turned
around
and
returned
to
the
united
states
and
was
stopped
by
united
states
customs
officials
at
derby
line,
vermont.
upon
the
search
of
the
vehicle
in
which
they
were
traveling,
the
customs
officials
found
concealed
in
the
engine
compartment
of
their
car
suitcase
containing
more
than
$300,000.00
in
the
united
states
currency.
now,
once
this
discovery
was
made
by
the
customs
officials
they
in
turn
notified
the
district
director
of
internal
revenue
in
burlington,
vermont
and
once
having
received
the
information
the
district
director
terminated
the
taxable
years
of
all
three
people
in
the
car
pursuant
to
his
authority
under
section
6851
of
the
code,
one
of
the
statute
here
which
was
employed
in
both
cases.
assessments
were
then
made
against
each
individual
in
an
amount
of
approximately
$195,000.00
for
this
terminated
period.
that
is
january
1,
1972
until
june
24,
1972,
the
day
that
the
discovery
of
the
cash
was
ascertained
by
the
customs
officials.
justice
potter
stewart
it
looks
as
though
these
years
are
open
for
these
taxpayers.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
just
one
month?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
valiant
value
of
her
property?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
a
volkswagen
automobile
and
â€“-
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
all
her
discoverable
property,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then
you
think
the
deficiency
notice
what
say
is
required
stops
the
government
in
his
tracks
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
--from
further
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
levying?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
your
statutory
support
for
that
or
is
it
purely
constitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
heavrin?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
argument
of
yours
that
made
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
the
argument
that
once
a
deficiency
notice
is
sent,
there
can
be
more
levies
on
the
part
of
the
government?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
with
the
question
before
was
somewhat
narrower
and
somewhat
different
that
is
whether
after
a
termination
by
the
commissioner,
there
was
an
obligation
to
send
the
deficiency
levy?
justice
potter
stewart
and
an
opportunity
the
tax
--
and
a
consequent
opportunity
for
the
taxpayer
to
go
to
tax
court.
justice
potter
stewart
let
alone
to
hire
a
lawyer?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
that
argument
really
isn't
made
in
your
brief,
is
it
or
have
i
missed
something
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
third
tier?
i
don't
know
that
you
ever
--
justice
potter
stewart
divided
among
them
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it's
a
total
of
almost
$600,000.00?
justice
potter
stewart
now
in
the
hall
case
maybe
i
misunderstand
it,
but
some
$52,500.00
was
assessed,
they
levied
on
a
couple
of
thousand
dollars
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
year
turned
off
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
she
got
a
refund?
justice
potter
stewart
will
you
give
us
that
reference
again?
justice
potter
stewart
on
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
