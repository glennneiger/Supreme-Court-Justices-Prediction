mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
don
heavrin,
i'm
the
attorney
for
elizabeth
jane
hall
the
respondent
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
versus
elizabeth
jane
hall.
i'd
like
to
start
out
and
say
this
morning
that
the
issue
simply
stated
is
what
restrictions
if
any
are
there
on
the
internal
revenue
service
when
the
internal
revenue
service
undertakes
to
collect
tax
that
the
service
believes
is
due
in
owing.
now
under
the
code
section
6203
provides
that
the
regional
director
can
issue
an
assessment
and
the
way
he
issues
the
assessment
is
by
writing
in
the
ledger
in
the
regional
directors
office
the
name
of
the
taxpayer
and
the
amount
of
money
that's
owed.
the
interesting
aspect
of
this
mechanical
procedure
is
that
as
soon
as
the
regional
director
makes
the
entry
and
writes
down
your
name
as
mr.
smith
said
that‘s
very
akin
to
a
civil
judgment.
in
fact
that
has
the
same
way
because
as
soon
as
that
entry
has
made
the
taxpayer
at
that
moment
is
in
debt
to
the
united
states
government
for
whatever
amount
the
regional
director
puts
in
the
book.
now,
the
regional
director
can
make
this
entry
without
any
particular
knowledge
about
the
taxpayer.
he
can
make
this
entry
without
any
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
taxpayer
used
the
money.
in
other
words
he
can
choose
any
person
in
any
amount
and
put
in
the
book
under
6203
and
at
that
moment
the
taxpayer
becomes
indebted
to
the
united
states.
now,
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
such
a
situation
is
dangerous
under
the
best
of
conditions,
but
the
dangerous
greatly
magnified
when
the
government
is
not
making
a
sincere
effort
to
collect
taxes.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
government
had
no
interest
in
mrs.
hall's
tax
liability,
what
the
irs
was
doing
was
endeavoring
to
punish
mrs.
hall
non-judicially
for
an
activity
that
they
had
concluded
that
she
was
involve
in.
and
they
elected
to
punish
mrs.
hall
because
of
the
presidential
directive
which
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
of
our
brief
where
then
present
in
the
united
states
mr.
nixon
suggested
that
anyone
who
is
expected
of
being
involved
in
the
drug
trafficking,
the
government
used
the
most
vigorous
procedures
imaginable
to
enforce
the
collection
of
taxes.
now,
the
trap
as
i
sit
in
the
brief
were
set
and
through
fortuity
of
circumstances,
mrs.
hall
stepped
into
the
trap
and
the
government
presented
her
the
$52,000.00
tax
bill
and
they
said
pay
up.
now
the
$52,000.00,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
no,
the
reliable
informant
that
mr.
smith
referred
to
was
not
a
reliable
informant.
mrs.
hall
was
not
involved
in
any
illegal
drug
trafficking.
mrs.
hall
was
residing
quietly
at
her
rental
home
in
shelby
county,
kentucky
when
the
internal
revenue
service
showed
up
and
said
“pay
this
bill.”
now
she
was
trapped,
the
fortuity
of
circumstances,
her
husband
was
arrested,
prosecuted
and
convicted
and
the
state
trooper,
powers
who
is
referred
to
in
my
brief
for
some
reason
which
i
have
never
been
able
to
determine,
concluded
that
mrs.
hall
must
likewise
be
involved
in
her
husbands
illegal
activities.
so
he
obtained
a
search
warrant
and
went
out
and
thoroughly
searched
mrs.
hall's
premises.
the
search
produced
two
narcotic
--
not
narcotic
substances
but
two
controlled
substances.
one
of
them
was
less
than
one
gram
of
hashish
and
one
was
one
amphetamine
crystal
both
of
these
narcotic
substances
were
not
the
property
of
mrs.
hall
but
were
substances
that
had
been
used
by
her
husband
and
mrs.
hall
quite
frankly
thought
that
they
had
all
been
removed
from
her
home.
this,
the
husbands
difficulty
had
caused
some
marital
problems,
i
don't
want
to
go
outside
the
record,
but
i'm
trying
to
explain
to
your
honor
what
led
up
to
this.
now
when
the
government
showed
up
and
presented
the
tax
bill
to
mrs.
hall,
the
bill
was
approximately
ten
times
her
entire
worth.
now
in
the
questioning
for
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
white,
i
see
that
the
court
his
understanding
and
seizing
on
the
issue.
now
mr.
smith
says
that's
very
simple
matter
for
the
taxpayer
to
go
into
the
united
states
district
court
after
he
has
filed
a
tax
return.
but
the
insidious
and
extremely
dangerous
thing
about
this
situation
is
that
the
tax
bill
continues
so
when
they
deliver
the
$52,000.00
tax
bill
to
mrs.
hall
they
seize
her
volkswagen,
they
take
it,
they
immediately
put
it
up
for
sale
which
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
assume
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
the
sale
of
the
volkswagen
produce
as
a
thousand
dollars,
well
they
take
the
thousand
dollars
and
they
apply
it
to
the
$52,000.00
tax
bill.
now
mrs.
hall
owes
$51,000.00
and
the
collection
procedures
are
still
moving.
the
collection
procedures
have
in
no
way
stopped.
they
have
been
no
way
been
abated
by
the
fact
that
they
have
seized
and
sold
her
volkswagen.
so
if
mrs.
hall
goes
to
work
the
following
monday
morning
and
she
works
a
week
and
she
gets
a
pay
check
from
her
employer,
the
government
seizes
the
pay
check.
the
government
seize
$57.00
from
her
bank
account,
the
government
said
that
they
were
going
to
come
back
and
take
certain
aspects
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that's
very
important.
the
reason
that's
so
important
is
that
you
see
filing
the
suit
in
the
tax
court
tolls
the
levy
and
distraint
power
of
the
government
so
the
$52,000.00
tax
bill
is
then
stopped
until
the
deficiency
can
be
redetermined
but
--
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
with
due
respect
to
the
court
i
think
that
that
is
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
we
have
eluded
this
morning
to
the
fact
that
they
did
not
get
the
money
back.
under
the
conditions
there,
maybe
a
certain
portions
of
the
code
not
in
question
in
at
this
time
that
wouldn't
able
the
government
to
keep
it
i
don't
know
exactly
what
status
mr.
laing
is
in.
i
do
know
that
the
two
taxpayers
are
in
radically
different
positions
because
the
money
that
was
assessed
against
mr.
laing
was
available,
but
the
money
that
was
assessed
against
mrs.
hall
was
not
available
so
my
research
is
not
been
directed
towards
the
issue
of
what
happens
if
the
money
is
available
and
can
be
readily
paid.
my
research
has
been
directed
towards
what
happens
if
money
cannot
be
paid.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
no,
i
think
that
if
we
take
a
look
at
the
6213
the
taxpayer
can
file
for
redetermination
within
90
days
and
then
if
we
look
at
6321
for
the
lien
for
the
taxes
and
then
the
person
refuses
to
pay
and
so
on
and
then
6331
which
is
levy
and
distraint
and
then
6335
which
is
sale
of
seized
property.
i
think
that
an
examination
of
those
sections
will
reveal
that
the
collection
procedures
stopped.
now
i'm
not
so
much
concerned
about
the
volkswagen,
you
see
that
was
taken
i'm
more
concerned
about
the
continuing
collection
procedures.
now
you
have
a
right
to
redetermine
the
deficiency
and
tax
court.
the
government
sends
the
taxpayer
the
notice.
the
door
of
the
tax
court
is
open
within
the
90
day
period
the
taxpayer
files
the
suit.
when
the
suit
is
filed
for
the
redetermination
of
the
deficiency
assume
they
sold
the
volkswagen
and
there's
$51,000.00
sill
owed
when
she
files
the
suit
that
prevents
the
irs
from
then
trying
to
collect
the
other
$51,000.00
until
the
deficiency
has
been
redetermined
and
this
is
the
protection.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
again
this
is,
this
is
a
really
a
tricky
constitutional
problem
the
due
process
calls
as
right
here
between
the
taxpayer
and
the
government
and
the
government
clearly,
to
illustrate
the
absurdity,
go
ahead
sir.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
as
a
statutory
matter
the
property
should
be
returned.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
okay,
yes
i
agree
with
you
that
the
shifts
the
equities
if
i
could
say
that
this
is
probably
a
two
or
three
tiered
argument.
one,
in
my
case
i
think
the
facts
are
so
radically
different.
mrs.
hall
was
making
no
effort
to
leave
the
country.
i
can't
argue
with
your
logic
that
if
you
catch
someone
at
the
border
who's
trying
to
get
out
of
the
country,
the
government
should
have
the
right
to
seize
the
property
and
hold
it
until
such
time
as
the
actual
tax
liability
can
be
litigated
but
i'm
not
entirely
sure
that
that
analogy
applies
to
a
taxpayer
who
was
not
trying
to
depart
the
country.
in
other
words
if
the
court
holds
the
way
you're
thinking
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
this
could
produce
some
incredible
inequities.
in
mrs.
halls
case
when
she
filed
the
1973
tax
return
the
government
after
the
most
scrupulous
audit
imaginable
refunded
her
$77.00
in
taxes
so
it
was
clear
that
it
no
time
that
she
owe
a
$52,000.00
tax
bill
or
anything
like
that
so
when
the
government
--
yes
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
no.
i'm
saying
that
after
the
government
has
moved
the
initial
seizure
is
made
and
litigation
begins.
you
see,
the
--
i've
obviously
not
made
myself
clear.
let
me
step
back
one
step,
the
bill,
$52,000.00,
the
government
comes
in
to
collect.
the
government
makes
the
seizure
of
her
property
and
all
available
assets.
the
seizure
does
not
equal
the
amount
of
the
assessment.
mrs.
hall
now
owes
the
government
$50,000.00
after
everything
has
taken.
is
it
the
court's
position
that
the
government
can
then
use
this
machinery
to
continue
to
strip
her
over
assets
forever?
she
can
never
take
another
paycheck
home.
she
can
never
have
another
bank
account.
she
can
never
have
any
clothing,
any
furniture
that
exceeds
$250.00
and
so
forth?
is
the
court's
position
that
the
government
can
continue
to
strip
her
of
her
assets?
she
continuous
to
work.
the
government
continuous
to
take
in
satisfaction
to
that
bill?
clearly,
some
place
along
the
line,
the
internal
revenue
service
must
be
stopped
because
to
hold
otherwise
would
give
the
opportunity
to
the
government
to
destroy
mrs.
hall
financially
and
put
her
into
a
condition
of
indigency
on
the
whim
of
a
regional
director.
there
must
be
some
way
to
stop
the
repeated
collections.
so
if
the
government
issues
this
deficiency
notice
which
was
so
argued
about
this
morning,
that
opens
the
door
to
tax
court.
that
gives
the
taxpayer
the
opportunity
to
redetermine
the
deficiency
and
if
takes
two
years
to
do
it,
during
that
two
year
period,
the
taxpayer
is
not
continually
stripped
of
his
assets.
he's
not
continually
impoverished
in
other
words
he
can
continue
working,
he
can
continue
producing,
he
continue
to
have
a
bank
account,
he
can
continue
to
hold
assets.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i'm
saying
that
that
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
am
saying
that
that
tolls
the
collection
procedure
or
should
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes,
very.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
no,
i
think
that's
correct
mr.
justice
powell.
the
problem
though
is
that
if
the
taxpayer
does
not
have
it.
now,
in
all
of
these
other
cases
that
we've
discussed
in
the
sixth
and
second
circuit
to
thought
it
out
over,
the
taxpayers
had
the
money.
for
example,
in
the
irving
case
at
$650,000.00,
i
believe
and
laing,
they
had
$300,000.00,
so
the
government
wasn't
asking
for
an
amount
that
exceeded
what
the
taxpayer
had.
so
they
could
make
that
seizure
of
the
$600,000.00
or
the
$300,000.00.
but
in
the
hall
case,
they've
asked
for
$52,000.00,
mrs.
hall
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
had
anything
that
even
approached
$52,000.00.
so
if
the
government
was
not
enjoined
and
stopped
from
coming
back
again
and
again
and
again
throughout
the
course
of
the
litigation,
they
could
continue
to
strip
mrs.
hall
of
every
dime
that
she
made,
but
in
the
clark
case
and
in
the
irving
case
and
the
laing
case,
there
wasn't
any
additional
money
being
taken
from
the
taxpayer.
am
i
making
myself
clear,
mr.
justice
powell?
in
other
words,
they
took
what
they
found,
the
$300,000.00
and
then
they
fought
it
out
over
who
is
entitled
to
the
$300,000.00.
in
the
hall
case,
they
said
its
$52,000.00
and
they
found
approximately
a
thousand
dollars
in
total
assets.
now
what
happens
to
that
other
$51,000.00
bill?
if
they
had
assessed
$50,000.00
and
she
had
$50,000.00
then
she
could
continue
her
life
in
a
normal
way
while
the
government
held
on
to
the
money.
but
when
they
assessed
the
$52,000.00
and
she
didn't
have
it
and
they
took
everything
she
had,
and
everything
she
had
did
not
satisfy
the
amount
of
the
assessment.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
further.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
think
it
is
constitutional
and
i
would
have
to
sit
down
here
and
read
these
statutes
one
word
at
a
time
and
i
will
say
that
if
that's
not
provided
in
those
four
sections
that
i
cited
to
the
court
then
it
clearly
it's
unconstitutional.
i
believe
that
it
is
embodied
in
either
6213,
6321,
6331
or
6335
but
i
have
to
sit
down
and
just
carefully
pick
it
out
but
if
it's
not
embodied
in
those
sections
then
i
think
there
very
serious
constitutional
questions
because
the
regional
director
could
on
the
whim
destroy
any
citizen
of
this
country,
and
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
fifth
amendment.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
due
process,
taking
without
due
process
of
law
and
the
fascinating
thing
in
the
--
at
the
same
time
the
extremely
dangerous
thing
is
that
if
--
this
is
probably
the
most
important
point
in
the
whole
argument
if
the
government
has
allowed
his
power,
there
is
no
one
who
is
beyond
to
the
reach
of
the
internal
revenue
service
because
they
can
simply
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
well
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes,
i
think
that
you
--
i
think
that,
that's
pretty
clear
and
you
see
the
amount
of
the
assessment.
this
is
what
happen
in
this
case,
the
amount
of
the
assessment
can
be
anything
that
the
director
writes
down,
which
is
extremely
dangerous
because
they
can
write
down
an
amount
that
exceeds
the
assets
of
anyone
and
if
nothing
else
has
gotten
out
of
my
rambling
up
here,
i
hope
the
court
sees
that
there
is
an
inherent
danger
when
the
--
if
you
were
a
multi-millionaire,
they
could
just
simply
write
in
the
assessment
book
a
figure
bigger
than
what
you
owed
or
what
you
owned
and
take
everything
away
from
you
and
then
continue
to
seize
your
property
until
the
assessment
was
satisfied
and
--
yes,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
okay,
the
government
takes
it.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
the
government
takes
it.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
well
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
the
point
is
well
taken
--
the
point
is
well
taken
and
to
carry
at
one
step
further,
i
think
tier
number
one,
they
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
do
this,
tier
number
two
if
they're
allowed
to
do
it
and
they're
to
take
the
taxpayers
property
as
security
while
the
litigation
goes
on
then
we're
entitled
to
go
in
the
tax
court
and
there's
a
sum
of
money
$100.00.
the
government
says
“you
owe
$100.00”
they
take
the
hundred
dollars
then
we
litigate
it
in
tax
court
and
the
government
continues
to
hold
the
$100.00
as
security
to
make
sure
that
the
taxpayer
does
not
squander
it.
but
if
the
government
says
”you
owe
$200.00
and
you
only
have
the
$100.00
and
we
do
not
get
in
tax
court.”
in
other
words,
if
they
pick
a
figure
that's
bigger
than
the
total
assets
of
the
taxpayer,
a
figure
is
chosen
that
exceeds
the
total
assets
of
the
taxpayer.
that's
puts
a
taxpayer
in
a
much
worst
position
mr.
justice
blackmun,
than
it
would
if
they
seized
an
amount
of
tax
then
that
would
be
in
one
lump
sum
and
one
ball
so
to
speak
that
they
could
fight
over.
but
if
the
amount
assessed
was
10
times
greater
than
what
she
had
as
she
continued
to
work
to
pay
the
rent
and
as
she
continued
to
work
to
buy
food
and
so
on,
as
you've
described.
the
government
would
continue
to
strip
her
of
her
additional
income.
so
if
the
government
can
wrap
it
up
in
a
package
in
a
package
in
a
$300,000.00
in
a
suitcase
under
the
hood
of
a
car
and
put
the
suitcase
in
a
safe
and
fight
it
out
over
that
without
effecting
mr.
laing's
other
income
making
potentials.
i
think
that's
a
different
situation
then
when
the
government
makes
an
assessment
that's
10
times
greater
than
the
amount
of
money
that
you
have
with
your
total
assets.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
think
that
if
we
prevail
here
the
status
quo
is
maintained
until
we
litigate.
actually
the
tax
of
year
for
1973
is
closed,
the
government
refunded
$77.00
to
mrs.
hall
and
there's
some
question
in
my
mind
as
to
where
did
they
would
now
be
entitled
anything
because
they
scrupulously
audited
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
okay,
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
our
district
judge
and
his
wisdom
said
with
this
highly
impractical.
the
government
couldn't
derive
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
in
sale
of
the
car
and
that
isn't
even
going
to
make
a
dent
in
the
tax
bill.
mrs.
hall
needs
to
get
to
in
and
from
work
so
he
said
“if
you'll
pose
the
bond
that
will
equal
the
approximate
value,
the
car
we'll
let
you
have
it
back.”
so
we've
got
a
corporate
surety
company
and
we
went
over
and
posted
a
bond
on
the
volkswagen
and
mrs.
hall
has
had
it
in
her
possession,
she's
been
driving
it
ever
since.
if
the
court
decides
in
our
favor,
i
don't
think
there
will
be
any
enormous
repercussions
anywhere
because
the
status
quo
will
simply
be
maintained.
mrs.
hall
will
continue
to
drive
her
1970
volkswagen.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
no,
mr.
justice,
three
tiers
of
this
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
think
that
government
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
do
this.
i
think
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
seize
a
taxpayer's
property
on
an
arbitrary
assessment
from
a
regional
director.
step
number
two,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
that
premise,
i
think
step
number
two
at
least
the
taxpayers
entitled
to
is
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
the
government
comes
and
seizes
what
it
can.
it
doesn't
equal
the
amount
of
the
tax
bill,
what
they've
seized
but
i
don't
think
the
government
should
then
be
allowed
to
continue
to
come
in
and
take
her
weekly
paycheck
and
so
on.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
for
her
car?
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
can
answer
that
by
saying,
i
don't
know
sir.
it's
a
very
interesting
–-
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
proposition.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
hate
to
admit
my
total
ignorance
but
that
is
an
interesting
situation.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
would
say
that
the
bond
would
be
dissolved
because
the
1973
texture
has
been
completely
concluded
apparently
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
internal
revenue
service
and
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
taxpayer.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
which
of
the
argument
is
that
sir?
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
don't
think
that
i
specifically
said
that.
i
believe
that
i
have
said
that
the
government
in
--
was
not
interested
in
a
fast
resolution
of
this
thing
and
i
believe
that
we
have
discussed
that
one,
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
that
for
you
sir,
if
you
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes.
this
is
--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes.
that
is
before
the
court,
definitely.
the
question
of
whether
further
collections
can
be
made
during
at
period
of
time
is
a
collateral
issue
but
its
vital
because
if
the
government
is
allowed
to
continue
its
collection
procedures,
during
the
pendency
of
the
action,
when
the
taxpayer
does
not
have
the
money
to
pay
the
assessment,
she
--
mrs.
hall
would
have
been
forced
into
indigency
and
would
have
been
kept
there.
she
would
have
been
on
welfare
because
nothing
that
she
would
have
produced
could
have
been
applied
to
the
rent
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
said.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
let
alone
to
hire
a
lawyer
and
that's
very
important.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
don't
know,
to
be
quite
frank,
i
would
have
to
read
the
thing
again.
i
reread
these
things
so
many
times.
this
is
a
collateral
issue
which
the
court
seized
upon,
during
mr.
smith's
statement
about
who
withhold
the
property.
my
position,
the
respondent's
position
is
that
the
government
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
seize
the
property,
if
the
court
so
holds
that
the
government
can
seize
the
property
has
collateral.for
payment
of
the
taxes,
then
the
respondent's
position
is
that
at
least
we
should
keep
the
status
quo
until
we
can
get
this
thing
litigated.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
the
third
tier
--
excuse
me
is
the
--
the
second
tier
and
first
tier
entwined
with
the
codal
aspects
of
the
thing.
the
third
tier
is
i
think
that
the
thing
is
unconstitutional
but
i'm
not
you
know
--
it's
more
or
less
an
equity
situation
and
it's
not
an
easy
case
because
the
code
is
extremely
complicated
and
the
government
has
the
first
used
one
section
and
then
another
and
then
argue
that
the
history
and
the
aspects
of
these
things.
i
think
that
codal
argument
alone
that
fits
the
government's
position.
for
example,
in
the
codal
argument,
if
you
read
that
section
6201,
that
grants
assessment
authority
for
taxes
that
are
to
be
paid
by
stamps
and
the
government
continues
to
ignore
that
provision
in
chapter
(a)
of
6201.
then
the
last
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph
says
this
authority
for
the
secretary
to
asses
taxes
shall
extend
to
and
that
enlist
four
other
situations,
but
none
of
those
situations
equal
or
approach
or
approximate
what
we
have
in
the
case
at
bar.
so
it
seems
that
the
government
has
grasped
this
one
code
section
and
said
now
this
is
empowers
us
to
do
what
we've
done
in
the
instant
case
and
i
don't
think
that
it
does.
i
think
the
government's
wrong
in
the
codal
argument,
mr.
stewart
--
mr.
smith
said
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
code
illustrates
if
the
government's
correct.
i
think
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
code
indicates
the
opposite
is
true,
right?
i
can't
get
it
through
my
thick
head,
that's
6201
really
gives
him
the
authority
to
make
assessments
and
jeopardy
situations.
i
think
i've
covered
about
everything
i
want
to.
oh!
one
interesting
aspect
which
the
second
circuit
suggested
that
a
bond
be
posted
and
the
government
has
--
mr.
smith
argued
that
the
bond
aspect
was
viable.
well,
as
soon
that
it
is
viable,
6863
is
the
code
section
that
provides
for
the
posting
of
bonds
but
section
6863
does
not
refer
to
section
6851
of
the
code.
it
refers
to
6861
of
the
code,
so
the
government
is
saying
under
a
6851
situation
you
can
post
to
bond
but
really
the
code
provides
for
the
posting
of
a
bond
only
under
a
6861
situation.
i
believe
that's
it
and
i
thank
you
all
for
your
attention.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes,
i
will
do
the
very
best
i
can,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
something
mr.
justice
brennan
said
earlier.
he
mentioned
that
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
is
considering
legislation
to
alter
the
jeopardy
assessment
procedure
and,
this
summer,
i
had
the
pleasure
of
testifying
as
a
witness
before
that
committee
but
our
hope
that
the
fact
that
there
is
a
move
of
foot
in
congress
to
alter
the
jeopardy
assessment
provisions
of
the
code
does
not
stop
this
court
from
taking
proper
action
in
this
case.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
sometimes,
congress
takes
a
long
time
to
do
what
should
be
done
right
away.
in
starting
the
argument,
specifically
in
reference
to
elizabeth
jane
hall,
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
comment
made
by
mr.
smith.
he
said
that
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
confusion
concerning
these
code
issues
and
what
is
before
the
court
and
these
various
courts,
and
he
indicates
that
the
courts
are
confused
because
of
various
interpretation
of
these
code
sections
that
are
at
stake.
well,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
a
lot
of
the
confusion
that
has
occurred
in
these
tax
cases
has
been
brought
about
by
the
activities
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
government,
each
time,
i
understand
its
argument
and
what
is
at
stake
and
what
is
an
issue,
they
seem
to
wiggle
away
a
little
bit
and
change
it
slightly.
today,
i
heard
for
the
first
time
in
mr.
smith’s
oral
argument
that
the
tax
that
was
assessed,
mrs.
hall
was
based
on
a
proposed
amount
of
illegal
controlled
substances
that
she
had
sold
during
this
31-day
period.
in
the
first
argument
in
january,
he
said
the
amount
was
based
on
information
given
by
a
confidential
informant
and,
when
the
government
argued
this
case
at
the
sixth
circuit,
they
stated
they
had
no
idea
how
this
$52,000
fee
was
reached.
also,
in
the
genesis
of
this
case
if
we
go
back
on
page
13
of
the
appendix
in
this
case,
this
is
from
the
sixth
circuit.
this
is
actually
a
xerox
copy
of
the
government
document,
but
if
we
look
at
page
13
of
the
appendix,
we
see
that
the
government
sends
out
a
tax
bill
to
mrs.
hall
and
on
the
tax
bill,
i
will
read
this
to
the
court,
it
says
“this
notice
of
tax
due
on
your
return
identified
above.”
then,
we
look
above
and
we
see
that
this
is
a
1040
return
according
to
the
government.
well,
such
is
not
the
case.
when
we
first
entered
this
case,
the
government
was
alleging
that
there
was
a
$52,000
deficit
on
mrs.
hall’s
tax
return
when
no
return
had
been
filed
at
all.
so,
we
filed
a
complaint
and
said
that
if
any
return
had
been
filed
in
mrs.
hall’s
name,
it
was
a
fraudulent
tax
return
because
mrs.
hall
did
not
file
any
tax
return
for
that
short
period
of
time.
then
when
we
get
to
the
legal
issues,
we
see
that--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes,
but
i
have
to
assume
that
the
government
is
intelligent
enough
to
select
the
correct
form,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
as
counsel
for
mrs.
hall,
i
cannot
be
responsible
for
the
government
taking
out
the
wrong
document
and
alleging
that
she
has
filed
a
tax
return.
i
have
to
refuse
that.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
okay,
i
am
saying--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
okay,
i
am
saying
that
the--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
well,
i
am
not
saying
necessarily
that
it
is
prejudice.
i
am
just
saying
that
a
lot
of
the
confusion
that
mr.
smith
refers
to
has
been
caused
by
the
government
and
when
we
get
to
the
actual
legal
decisions
in
this
area,
for
example,
in
the
schreck
case
the
government
has
had
an
enormous
difficulty
overcoming
the
idea
of
the
assessment
authorities.
mr.
justice
white
said,
where
does
the
authority
come
from?
well
mr.
smith,
in
his
argument,
he
says
it
originates
in
6201.
but,
originally,
the
government
argued
in
the
schreck
case
that
6851
in
and
of
itself
contained
the
implicit
power
to
assess.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
well,
this
is
no
exception.
well,
the
point
is
that
every
time
you
nail
them
down
and
you
say
“is
this
what
you
are
arguing?”
and
you
are
wrong
on
this
issue,
they
slip
away
and
argue
it
a
little
bit
differently.
now,
before
this
court--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes,
that
is
true.
okay,
now,
i
was
getting
into
the
meat
of
the
case.
in
this
particular
case,
the
government
has
argued
that
the
assessment
authority
originates
in
6201
and
this
is
a
general
provision
of
assessment
authority
granted
by
congress.
but
if
we
examine
6201,
as
i
stated
in
the
brief,
this
particular
section
refers
to
taxes
that
are
payable
by
a
stand
such
as
liquor
taxes,
gambling
taxes,
and
so
forth.
taxes
that
relate
to
income
and
jeopardy
situations
in
income
tax
situations
are
found
in
6851
and
6861
or
a
combination
of
both.
now,
on
the
issue
of
deficiency
which
the
court
questioned
mr.
smith
about,
the
government,
in
the
cases
where
they
have
prevailed,
for
example
in
the
irving
case,
they
were
able
to
convince
the
court
that
what
was
assessed
against
the
taxpayer
really
was
not
a
tax
at
all.
and
if
take
a
look
in
the
government’s
brief,
and
i
do
not
recall
the
exact
page
but
i
believe
it
was
about
page
26
of
the
government’s
brief,
they
say
that
“we
are
not
really
assessing
a
tax.
we
are
merely
assessing
a
provisional
amount
that
has
to
be
paid,
sort
of
an
insurance
policy
that
assures
that
the
money
will
be
there
when
and
if
the
tax
liability
is
established.”
now,
at
this
point,
the
government
is
telling
this
court
and
the
second
circuit
and
all
the
other
courts
that
there
really
is
no
tax.
then
when
we
raised
the
objection
of
flora
where
he
says,
“we
have
not
paid
the
tax.
we
cannot
pay
the
tax
because
mrs.
hall
does
not
have
the
money,”
when
we
raise
the
flora
objection
and
say
the
full
payment
rule
prevents
us
from
filing
suit,
they
answer
by
saying
“no,
it
does
not
because
this
really
is
not
a
tax
and
no
deficiency
is
created.”
well,
i
think
that
that
statement
is
incorrect.
i
think
the
only
thing
the
government
can
collect
against
a
citizen,
the
irs
at
least,
is
a
tax,
and
i
cannot
accept
the
provisional
amount
theory.
now,
if
we
accept
the
provisional
amount
theory,
today,
mr.
smith
is
rigorously
asserting
the
anti-injunction
act
prohibits
this
type
of
suit,
and
he
recited
it
to
the
court.
but
if
we
read
the
anti-injunction
act,
it
says
that
no
action
to
restrain
the
collection
of
taxes
shall
be
made.
so,
if
we
adapt
mr.
smith’s
theory
that
this
really
is
not
a
tax,
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
anti-injunction
act
has
no
application
and
they
can
be
enjoined
from
what
they
are
doing.
i
do
not
believe
we
have
to
go
that
far
because
i
believe
it
is
in
6861,
the
jeopardy
assessment.
i
believe
that
is
the
correct
code
section.
but
if
we
accept
his
argument
on
the
provisional
theory
idea,
then
this
really
is
not
a
tax
and
the
anti-injunction
act
does
not
apply.
this
puts
the
government,
in
my
opinion,
in
the
interesting
position
where
if
they
are
trying
to
stop
you
from
suing
them,
they
say
it
is
a
tax
but
if
they
are
trying
to
keep
you
out
of
tax
court
and
keep
you
from
litigating
your
claim
without
full
payment,
they
say
it
is
only
a
provisional
amount.
now,
the
case
when
it
reached
my
desk,
i
had
the
feeling
and
i
still
do
that
there
was
something
seriously
wrong
in
the
situation
where
the
government
could
go
out
to
a
lady’s
house
and
say
“here
is
a
tax
bill
for
$52,000.
pay
it.”
and
mr.
smith,
very
cavalierly
says
that
“we
refuse
to
pay
the
bill”
or
“there
was
not
any
way
we
could
pay
the
bill”
because
mrs.
hall
simply
did
not
have
$52,000.
the
$52,000
bill
was
approximately
ten
times
her
entire
worth.
the
provisions
under
the
code,
full
payment
or
post
a
bond
for
the
total
amount
and
full
payment
file
a
refund
suit.
it
left
mrs.
hall
literally
without
a
remedy,
and
the
further
i
get
into
the
case,
the
more
unjust
it
seems.
every
citizen,
i
think,
has
a
fear
of
the
internal
revenue
service
more
so
than
the
fbi
or
the
cia
or
any
of
these
other
organizations.
and
it
may
be
veiled,
fear
in
a
remote
fear
at
most
times,
but
in
the
instant
case,
the
fear
of
irs
was
not
only
real
but
it
was
realized
by
mrs.
hall.
now,
the
government
is
not
the
type
of
organization
that
ever
admits
that
it
was
in
error.
no
matter
what
they
are
doing,
they
always
justify
their
actions
by
saying
“this
is
for
the
common
good
and
this
is
for
some
lofty
purpose.”
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
do
not
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
citizens
should
fear
their
government.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
think
the
guy
should
be
prosecuted,
but--
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
i
am
not
talking
specifically
about
the
man
who
has
been
dodging
taxes.
i
am
talking
about
the
average
guy
who
goes
to
work
at
a
factory
everyday
eight
days
a
week.
he
has
more
fear
of
irs
than
he
does
any
other
governmental
agency.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
yes,
i
think
it
is
a
generalization.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
so,
what
i
am
pointing
out,
i
thought
i
had
gotten
into
it
by
saying
that
the
fear
was
realized
in
mrs.
hall’s
case.
the
irs
actually
showed
up
on
her
doorstep.
the
irs
actually
made
a
demand
of
her
for
a
sum
of
money
that
far
exceeded
her
total
net
worth
and,
as
we
have
stated
in
the
argument
here
in
january
and
in
the
brief,
at
that
time
mrs.
hall
was
without
a
remedy.
mrs.
hall
then
proceeded
to
the
united
states
district
court
where
she
filed
a
suit.
now,
6851
assessments,
according
to
the
government,
are
tentative
in
nature
and
this
is
admitted
by
the
government
in
its
brief.
i
cannot
recall
exactly
where
it
is
in
the
brief
but
they
say
these
things
are
tentative
in
nature.
yet,
based
on
this
tentative
tax
liability,
the
irs
immediately
drags
off
her
automobile.
a
few
days
later,
they
put
it
up
for
sale.
what
could
the
government
gain
in
such
a
situation?
in
one
of
these
equity
balancing
situations,
mrs.
hall
was
the
one
with
everything
to
lose
and,
in
theory,
she
could
have
actually
lost
her
livelihood
because
not
being
able
to
make
the
full
payment,
not
being
able
to
make
the
$52,000
payment,
the
assessment
against
her
would
continue
unless
she
could
stop
the
internal
revenue
service
from
continuing
the
process
of
collection.
in
the
last
argument,
i
mentioned
to
the
court
that
the
example
if
she
goes
to
work
on
the
following
monday
morning
and
she
draws
a
paycheck
at
the
end
of
the
week,
the
government
can
attach
that
paycheck
and
apply
it
to
the
$52,000.
in
a
way,
she
is
in
a
very
much
more
difficult
position
than
mr.
laing
because
mr.
laing
actually
had
the
money
and
then
the
clifford
irving
case,
clifford
irving
actually
had
the
money.
but
what
happens
to
the
taxpayer
who
does
not
have
the
money
and
cannot
stop
the
collection
procedure?
they
are
trapped
in
a
snowball
that
is
rolling
downhill
that
keeps
getting
bigger
as
it
goes
and
there
is
nothing
they
can
do
about
it
unless
they
have
the
option
of
going
into
the
united
states
district
court
as
mrs.
hall
did
filing
a
suit,
enjoining
the
internal
revenue
service
from
the
collection
of
its
taxes.
i
think
that
i
have
pretty
well
explained
our
position.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
will
quit.
i
want
to
say
that
when
i
argued
this
case
at
the
sixth
circuit,
the
lawyer
who
represented
the
government
came
over
to
me
and
we
had
lunch
and
he
said
“we
have
stopped
this.
irs
is
not
using
this
procedure.”
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
no,
judge,
i
was
just—mr.
justice.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
okay.
mr.
donald
m.
heavrin
okay,
i
was
going
to
close
by
saying
i
hope
that
this
court
hands
down
a
ruling
that
will
cause
irs
to
not
be
tempted
to
restart
this
procedure
of
jeopardy
assessments
where
there
really
is
not
jeopardy
and
the
purpose
of
the
assessment
is
punitive
in
nature.
thank
you.
