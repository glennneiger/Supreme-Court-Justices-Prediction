justice
byron
r.
white
because
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
suit
was
--
if
what
this
was
all
about
in
the
district
court
in
the
laing
case
was
to
get
the
money
back,
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
government
can
keep
the
money
whether
notice
has
to
be
issued
or
not
pending
litigation
somewhere,
the
plaintiff
could
never
win
in
the
district
court
in
such
a
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
get
the
money
back
when
he
wins
his
law
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
pending
litigation
under
this
kind
of
an
assessment
or
a
jeopardy
assessment
the
government
can
keep
the
money
while
litigation
is
going
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
how
could
the
plaintiff
have
ever
won
this
case
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
where
he
said
“i
want
the
money
back
because
you
did
not
issue
a
notice
of
deficiency.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that
would
be
true
whether
he
went
to
the
tax
court
or
whether
he
went
to
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
i
don't
--
i
still
do
not
think
you've
given
glimmers
to
how
the
government
is
hurt
in
this
case
so
that
making
a
legalistic
argument
which
is
a
fair
argument
alright,
but
not
so
intended.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let
us
assume
you
loose
this
suit
what
will
happen
in
the
laing
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
will
keep
the
money
aren't
you
pending
litigation
in
the
tax
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
that
is
what
i
want
to
know.
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
late
for
you
to
issue
a
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
you
make
a
new
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
apparently
there
--
but
at
least
prospectively,
the
collection
of
the
revenue
would
not
be
the
least
be
impaired
if
you
lost
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
knew
what
the
rule
was
in
advance.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you're
afraid
that
your
failure
to
issue
the
notice
may
have
foreclosed
your
collecting
the
tax
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
have
the
taxable
years
are
involved
are
long
since
been
over,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
any
body
filed
a
return,
has
any
body
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
then
you
are
in
the
position
if
you
think
it
is
proper
to
make
it
jeopardy
assessment
after
the
close
of
the
taxable
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
mind
if
the
court
said
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
to
play
what
is
right
about
flora
in
support
of
the
constitutional
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
only
that
you
don't
you
mind,
but
you
contemplate
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
construction
specifically
will
6331
authorizes
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
even
without
saying
the
word
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
you
do
before
you
seized
the
money
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
makes
you
think
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
just
a
matter
of
equity
if
the
government
has
omitted
a
statutory
duty,
they
just
thought
of
give
the
money
back,
is
that
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
least
immediately
thereafter?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mr.
smith,
what's
the
earliest
possible
time
assuming
your
right
that
he
has
to
go
to
the
district
court
that
he
could
ever
get
anybody
to
rule
a
judicial
officer
to
rule
on
or
even
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
you
were
right
in
probably
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
he
--
it
takes
him
what
six
months,
i
mean
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
he
doesn't
have
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
he
can't
--
the
court,
i
mean
the
taxpayer
can't
go
to
court
until
he
gets
it
turned
down.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
can
take
six
months
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
--
that
maybe
for
the
total
resolution
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
for
a
decision
on
the
merit.
but
there's
no
way
that
anybody
can
even
--
that
plainly
erroneous
levy
assessments
could
be
sorted
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
authority
did
you
have
to
seize
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
not
give
them
10
days
notice
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
have
to
take
the
last
sentence
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
you
not
give
him
10
days
notice
of
the
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
6851
says
the
tax
shall
become
immediately
due
and
payable.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does
not
speak
at
all
about
what
you
can
do
to
collect
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
then
you
say
you
have
to
look
at
6331
to
collect
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
are
you
not
giving
him
10
days
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
was
that
finding
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
