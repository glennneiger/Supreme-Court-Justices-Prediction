justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
how
that
figure
was
arrived
at?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
smith,
would
you
assume
that
i
asked
the
same
question
when
you
cover
the
hall
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
smith,
would
you
straighten
me
out
a
little
bit?
had
this
been
a
jeopardy
assessment
after
the
conclusion
of
the
taxable
year,
a
deficiency
notice
would
be
issued
even
after
assessment,
wouldn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
does
this
mean
that
with
a
jeopardy
assessment
that
one
may
then
go
to
the
tax
court
even
though
the
assets
have
been
levied
upon?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
being
the
case
how
would
the
government
be
heard
by
a
ruling
that
in
the
event
of
a
termination
as
distinguished
from
a
jeopardy
assessment
a
notice
of
deficiency
could
be
issued
after
the
fact
enabling
the
taxpayer
to
go
to
the
tax
court.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
commissioner's
position
then
of
course
raises
the
constitutional
issue.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
that
will
put
the
unusual
claim,
doesn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it's
of
no
significance.
my
experience
has
just
been
the
opposite
that
you
wait
and
wait
and
wait
despite
the
request.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
your
argument
assumes
that
speed
is
the
only
criterion.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
first
off,
a
notice
could
be
issued
tomorrow.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
a
notice
could
be
issue
tomorrow.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
that
is
an
administrative
decision.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
smith,
i
think
we
all
can
see
this
as
you
argued
it
but
i
gather
there
is
a
little
concern
up
here
why
if
the
government
is
so
disturbed
about
the
possibility
of
these
revenues
slipping
away,
they
do
not
issue
a
deficiency
tomorrow
as
a
matter
of
preservation
of
the
revenues.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
this
has
nothing
to
loose
by
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
the
irs
feels
that
the
collection
is
in
jeopardy.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
we
can
have
the
jeopardy
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
with
a
domestic
taxpayer
who
isn't
living
in
the
country
suppose
she
had
$50,000.00
went
of
to
las
vegas
and
started
putting
it
in
the
slot
machines?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
saying
that
government
can't
move
in
even
though
she
has
instituted
a
suit
in
the
tax,
correct?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you're
saying
that
by
filing
a
petition
to
the
tax
court
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
is
impossible.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
division
of
the
country?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
taking?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
incidentally
this
same
argument
was
made
the
last
term
and
americans
united.
this
was
a
tax
exempt
organization,
originally
but
the
argument
doesn't
prevail.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
i
think
it
was
best
i
have
difficulty
in
drawing
lines
that
way
of
suppose
she
had
$49,000.00?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
suppose
she
had
exactly
the
amount
that
they
assessed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
rent
is
still
due
next
month
maybe,
the
grocery
bills.
it
seems
to
me
that
she's
then
just
as
distrust
is
in
the
situation
you
painted
for
us.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
she
had
$3,000.00
more
than
they
assessed,
she
could
be
distressed.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
oteri,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question
that
was
showered
on
your
co-counsel
if
you
have
a
way
into
the
tax
court,
is
the
government
forthwith
distraint
from
levy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
incidentally,
while
we
have
you
interrupted,
there
is
pending
here
another
tax
case,
united
states
v.
shapiro
and,
somewhere
in
your
argument,
will
you
relate
that
one
to
these
cases
if
there
is
any
relationship?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
feel
they
are
disparate
provisions?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
statutory
argument
rests,
in
large
part,
on
that
three-year
interval,
does
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
it
was
not,
you
would
have
a
much
harder
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
notice
not
just
a
form--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
do
not
get
your
point.
what
are
you
leading
to?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
many
instances
were
wrong
forums
are
involved.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
even
any
prejudice
to
anybody.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is
not
required.
there
is
plenty
of
law
to
this
effect
that
the
government
does
not
have
to
be
consistent
in
tax
cases
and
they
certainly
have
not
been
over
the
years.
then,
i
ask
what
the
point
is.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
practice,
we
have
all
been
subjected
to
that
frustration
but
it--
