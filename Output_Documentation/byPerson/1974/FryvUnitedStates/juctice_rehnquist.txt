mr.

supposing
to
follow
up
another
one
on
mr.
justice
blackmun's
questions
that
congress
decides
that
what
we
need
to
hold
on
or
not,
just
wages
but
spending
in
general
by
states.
and
so
they
said
that
no
state
during
a
fiscal
year
in
1975
could
exceed
its
total
expenditures
for
fiscal
year
1975.
and
there
were
findings
that
would
pass
the
rational
basis
test
that
that
would
help
in
the
exercise
of
commerce
power
of
control
over
the
inflation.
now,
do
you
think
that's
the
end
of
the
inquiry?
mr.
juctice
rehnquist
you
don't
think
that
even
under
the
rational
basis
commerce
part
as
they
could
set
a
ceiling
on
a
state
budget.
mr.
juctice
rehnquist
the
taxing
power
is
certainly
can
seek,
conferred
in
very,
very
broad
authority
to
power
or
lay
and
collect
taxes
without
any
textual
limitations
as
i
recall.
mr.
juctice
rehnquist
well
ms.
lafontant,
if
what
we
had
here
were
employees
of
private
employers
doing
exactly
the
work
and
potentially
receiving
exactly
the
amount
of
wages
as
these
employees.
i
take
it
that
commerce
clause
extent
of
congress'
part
just
measured
by
the
commerce
power
be
exactly
the
same
whether
they
were
private
employers
or
state
employers.
mr.
juctice
rehnquist
the
rub
comes
from
the
fact
that
it
may
be
that
congress
can't
exert
the
commerce
power
to
the
same
extent
against
states
as
it
can
against
private
employers.
