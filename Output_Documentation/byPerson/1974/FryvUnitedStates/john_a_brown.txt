mr.
john
a.
brown
mr
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
excuse
me
for
not
getting
up,
that's
something
i
do
less
well.
we
are
here
today
on
a
case
that
is
at
least
in
our
judgment,
extremely
important
to
all
50
states.
we
are
here
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
the
certiorari
granted
by
this
court
last
february.
the
matter
all
began
in
the
state
of
ohio.
the
ohio
109th
general
assembly
passed
a
bill,
amended
substitute
senate
bill
number
147
and
it
was
signed
by
governor
gilligan,
and
to
be
effective
on
the
first
day
of
the
pay
period
which
included
january
1,
1972.
the
bill
provided
for
a
pay
increase
for
all
state
employees
of
either
38
cents
per
hour
or
10%
whichever
was
more.
it
averaged
out
to
be
a
pay
increase
of
roughly
7.7%
for
all
state
employees.
after
the
statute
was
passed,
signed
by
the
governor,
the
state
of
ohio
asked
the
federal
pay
board
for
authority
to
pay
the
increase,
the
ohio
general
assembly
have
enacted.
the
pay
board
heard
the
petition,
granted
the
authority
to
make
the
increase
effective
march
10,
1972.
so
there
was
a
period
of
roughly
two
and
one-half
months
when
the
pay
increase
was
not
paid.
the
federal
pay
board
decided
that
the
amount
that
would
be
paid
starting
from
march
10,
1972
through
the
remainder
of
the
buying
in
would
equal
an
amount
that
will
be
consistent
with
the
federal
pay
board
standards.
thereafter,
we
filed
an
action
in
mandamus
in
the
supreme
court
of
which
we
asked
the
ohio
supreme
court
to
order
direct
the
state
officials
to
pay
the
increase
that
the
ohio
general
assembly
said
they
should
pay.
the
ohio
supreme
court
issued
a
mandate
that
we
requested.
immediately,
the
federal
government
sought
and
obtained
a
temporary
restraining
order
from
the
federal
district
court
in
ohio
which
was
then
continued
by
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals
here
in
washington.
and
when
the
matter
came
to
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals
they
ruled
that
the
pay
increase
was
beyond
the
scope
of
ohio
to
get
that
the
state
of
ohio
was
enjoined
from
doing
what
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
had
ordered
the
governor
and
the
order
to
do.
we
then
found
our
petition
here
under
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
we
filed
the
motion
of
not
as
an
academic
matter
but
because
we
seriously,
honestly
contend
that
the
tenth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution
prevents
the
federal
pay
board
and
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals
from
doing
what
did
they
do.
now,
after
this
court
granted
the
petition
last
february.
the
united
states
has
filed
a
motion
asking
that
the
writ
now
be
ruled
to
have
been
improvidently
granted
to
use
the
words
of
the
solicitor
general.
they
argued
that
even
though
that
since
the
decision
of
the
teca.
a
situation
has
occurred
in
california
in
which
a
situation
very
similar
to
this
occurred.
when
the
california
general
assembly
has
to
pay
increase
for
its
employees
and
the
california
governor
went
to
the
pay
board
as
the
ohio
governor
again,
got
authority
which
was
only
partially
what
the
statute
said.
the
california
employees
went
to
the
california
supreme
court
in
mandamus
as
the
ohio
did.
the
california
supreme
court
granted
the
writ
and
again
as
the
ohio
did.
then
the
federal
government
filed
a
petition
for
an
injunction
in
california,
again
as
it
did
in
ohio.
the
injunction
was
granted.
and
thereafter
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
teca
and
to
the
government
surprise
or
with
(inaudible)
surprise.
the
teca
reversed
in
the
cohen
case
and
california
saying
that
the
reason
they
reversed
is
the
injunction
was
applied
for
on
may
14,
1974
which
was
two
weeks
after
the
economic
stabilization
act
had
expired
and
we
understand
although
it's
not
in
the
record
that
the
government
has
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
the
certiorari
in
that
case.
and
it
seems
to
us
anomalous
to
say
the
least
that
the
government
one
on
the
one
hand
contend
that
our
writ
should
be
dismissed
as
being
improvidently
granted.
and
on
the
other
hand,
contend
of
the
case
of
almost
exactly
similar
important
should
be
admitted
by
this
court
in
cohen
versus
california.
we
--
mr.
john
a.
brown
that's
what
i
understand.
mr.
john
a.
brown
well
there
is
no
question
but
that
when
the
teca
acted
in
our
case,
they
acted
on
expired
so
that
the
injunction
that
once
they
issued
remains
in
the
cohen
versus
california.
teca
decided
that
the
application
for
the
injunction
came
two
weeks
after
the
active
expired
so
that
i
think
the
answer
is
that
ohio
was
enjoined
and
california
is
not.
mr.
john
a.
brown
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals,
i
think
so.
mr.
john
a.
brown
not
in
the
present
posture.
we
would
have
to
do
something
more
than
it
has
been
done.
now,
i
think
i'm
obligated
to
say
to
the
court.
that
we
filed
an
action
six
weeks
ago
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
again
asking
for
another
mandate
saying,
“pay
the
money
now”.
now,
if
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
december
1974
or
february
1975
issued
another
order
to
governor
gilligan
and
auditor
tracey
and
said,
“pay
the
money
now”.
mr.
john
a.
brown
as
a
great
plenty
of
my
friends
have
reminded
me
that
it's
true.
and
said
governor
rhodes
pay
the
money
or
auditor
tracey
pay
the
money,
right
to
pay
the
money.
the
federal
governor
would
not
be
able
to
enjoin
that
mandate
unless
it
would
be
interpreted
that
the
order
of
the
september
1973
from
the
teca
was
broad
enough
to
cover
what
the
supreme
court
might
do
later.
mr.
john
a.
brown
that's
true.
mr.
john
a.
brown
true.
mr.
john
a.
brown
yes
and
of
course
the
employees
will
be
markedly
different
because
we're
talking
about
some
55,000
state
employees
and
thereabouts.
in
two
years,
they
have
changed
markedly.
but
the
ohio
general
assembly
could
when
it
goes
into
session
in
january
of
1975,
grant
a
pay
increase
to
in
effect
makeup
for
what
the
employees
some
10.5
million
dollars
that
they
did
not
receive
two
years
ago
plus.
mr.
john
a.
brown
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
john
a.
brown
no.
mr.
john
a.
brown
that
i
am
not
sure.
the
injunction
by
its
term
and
the
court
will
see
on
the
last
paragraph
of
the
order
of
the
teca
is
very
broad
and
how
that
might
be
interpreted
to
apply
if
the
state
of
ohio
now
tried
to
pass
a
retroactive
pay
increase,
i
simply
don't
know.
i
would
not
like
the
question
to
occur.
mr.
john
a.
brown
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
hear
all
your
questions.
mr.
john
a.
brown
agreed
and
of
course
there
have
been
ample
presidents
which
say
that
if
company
a
and
labor
union
b
agreed
that
a
pay
increase
will
be
made
to
employees
of
x
dollars
per
hour
and
x
cents
per
hour,
after
the
freeze
expires.
that
agreement
is
no
good
at
all.
now
the
question
about
what
would
happen
if
ohio
now
tried
to
retroactively
do
something
in
january
or
february
of
1975.
i
don't
think
it
has
been
answered.
the
point
we
want
to
emphasize
most,
we
think
in
oral
argument,
is
that
what
the
teca
seem
to
say
was
that
maryland
versus
wirtz
decided
by
this
court,
answered
the
appeal
we
made
at
the
teca
a
year
ago.
we
contended
certainly
does
not
that
maryland
against
wirtz
decided
that
the
amendments
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act
as
applied
to
the
state
schools
and
state
institutions
for
the
mentally
retarded,
etcetera
limited
the
states
authority
to
act
and
that
the
flsa
amendment
were
constitutional
but
in
both
of
majority
and
the
minority
or
the
majority
dissent
in
maryland
against
wirtz.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
language
indicating
that
if
the
united
states
congress
had
in
the
flsa,
said
that
the
minimum
wage
that
the
state
of
ohio
shall
pay
to
all
its
employees
shall
be
$2.20
per
hour,
that
this
would
not
have
been
permissible
under
the
tenth
amendment.
we
maintain
that
you
can
agree
the
tenth
amendment
as
having
any
meaning
at
all
and
say
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
may
do
that.
now,
the
chief
justice
use
many
years
ago
in
this
court
said
that
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
congress
is
meaningful
and
to
an
argument
that
lawyers
raised
that
if
some
act
of
the
congress
was
not
restrained,
it
would
harm
the
courts
or
harm
the
states
and
destroy
the
state
(inaudible)
chief
justice
hughes
said
“not
probably
this
court
sits.
but
we
submit
that
if
here,
the
argument
or
the
contingence
of
the
teca
would
be
supported
by
this
court.
then
the
tenth
amendment
will
have
very
little
meaning
left
in
what
normally
chief
justice
hughes
but
justice
cardozo
and
many
others
had
warned
against
would
certainly
be
a
current.
i
would
like
to
save
what
moments
i
have
to
reply.
mr.
john
a.
brown
yes.
you
know,
we
have
argued
this
matter
now
several
times.
i
think
this
is
the
first
time
i've
heard
anyone
from
united
states
agree
that
there's
limit
on
the
commerce
power
that's
comforting
me
here.
because
we
certainly
agree
with
counsel
for
the
appellee,
that
unless
there's
a
limit
on
the
commerce
power
then
we
must
all
remove
the
tenth
amendment
and
simply
does
not
mean
when
it
said.
now,
judge
mosk
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
cohen
versus
california
case
said,
“perhaps
a
trend
toward
centralized
authority
and
judicial
acquiescence
in
it
are
irreversible.
nevertheless,
i
suggest
that
a
fait
accompli
is
not
necessarily
desirable
or
constitutionally
permissible.
we
agree
with
justice
mosk
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
dialogue
between
the
court
and
me,
and
the
court
and
my
delightful
counterpart
in
asking
whether
or
not
congress
had
something
and
i
don't
think
the
question
is
whether
they
had
but
whether
they
may
because
the
question
that
is
before
in
this
court
as
indicated
by
mr.
justice
marshall's
question.
is
that
a
year
from
now,
it
may
very
well
again
come
that
federal
wage
in
branch
controls
may
again
be
sought,
and
again
we
will
have
a
question
of
our
salaries
of
employees
of
new
york,
ohio,
california,
to
be
limited
again
as
they
purported
to
be
in
this
last
confrontation
we
had.
we
believe
that
you
cannot
say
to
the
state
of
ohio
under
the
tenth
amendment
that
your
budget
for
1975
may
be
no
more
than
5%
more
than
your
budget
from
1974.
and
you
may
not
say
that
salaries
for
state
employees
are
required
to
be
the
same
in
1975
as
they
were
in
1974,
or
that
you
may
not
say
that
salaries
for
employees
in
1975
must
be
10%
less
than
they
were
in
1974,
because
if
you
say
that
they
can
do
one
thing,
you
must
say
that
they
would
do
the
other
thing.
mr.
john
a.
brown
yes
but
again
that's
an
--
that's
a
different
matter
than
saying
that
the
state
of
ohio
that
you
cannot
pay
tax
collectors,
judges,
officials
that
have
no
counterpart
in
private
industry
at
all.
now,
maryland
against
wirtz
made
the
point
and
made
it
very
well,
that
there
was
a
matter
in
competition
with
private
industry.
david-bacon
deals
primarily
with
private
industry
or
at
least
jobs
comparable
to
private
industry.
we're
not
--
we're
much
further
than
that
in
this
case.
here,
we're
talking
about
100%
of
the
job
for
the
state
i
would
withdraw
and
you
may
arrest
me
going
home
because
i'm
trying
to
do
best.
he
wouldn't
be
limited
as
would
be
a
handyman
in
the
school.
and
that's
much,
much
broader
than
words
was.
mr.
john
a.
brown
the
governor's
salary
is
regulated
by
constitution
in
ohio.
mr.
john
a.
brown
true.
mr.
john
a.
brown
true.
mr.
john
a.
brown
true.
mr.
john
a.
brown
in
a
while,
yes.
now,
that
may
or
may
not
two
another
states.
mr.
john
a.
brown
in
ohio,
it
is.
mr.
john
a.
brown
true.
mr.
john
a.
brown
thank
you
very
much.
