mr.
brown,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
this
now
that
you're
understanding
that
the
government
has
or
plans
to
file
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeal
of
september
19,
1974
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
of
america
against
the
state
of
california?
unknown
speaker
because
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
now
that
i've
interrupted
that
what
--
the
fact
is
assume
that
the
decision
in
the
california
case
of
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals
remains
undisturbed.
what
effect
would
that
have
upon
the
viability
continued
importance
or
even
continued
viability
of
your
litigation.
as
i
understand
it
here,
under
this
decision
i
made,
you
tell
me
if
i'm
mistaken,
your
clients
will
get
everything
you're
asking
for,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
reasoning
of
this
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
you
talked
about
the
enforce
--
on
enforcement
proceeding.
i
have
plans
for
this,
i
am
very
carefully
but
i
--
do
you
think
therefore
that
this
assuming
that
this
decision
remains
unchanged,
that
it
would
have
or
it
will
give
your
clients
no
benefit
at
all?
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
be
governor
gilligan
in
february
1975?
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
that's
not
going
to
be
your
position?
unknown
speaker
in
that
litigation?
unknown
speaker
at
least
they
could
give
a
prospective
wage
increase
without
interference
by
the
federal
government
now.
unknown
speaker
and
make
up
for
it
did
directly
that
way
assuming
they
had
the
same
employees
that
they
had
before.
unknown
speaker
do
they
give
a
retroactive
under
ohio
law
but
your
legislature
now
gave
a
retroactive
pay
allowance,
mr.
brown?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
could
then
you
take
it
anything
of
any
barrier
to
that
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
or
in
this
injunction?
unknown
speaker
did
the
government
resist
an
application
of
dissolved
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
but
either
way
it
would
leave
the
judgment
of
the
teca
in
effect,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
not
before
you
resolve
it?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
lafontant,
perhaps
you
already
told
the
court
but
if
so
i
missed
it.
has
the
government
petition
for
certiorari
or
does
it
plan
to
from
those
--this
september
decision
of
the
emergency
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
even
begin
to
face
that
question
until
the
court
acts
on
your
petition
for
rehearing.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
under
submission,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
feel
this
case
as
governed
by
maryland
against
wirtz.
unknown
speaker
well
i
just
wanted
a
flat
answer
and
then
--
unknown
speaker
you're
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
that
is
--
is
it
in
your
brief
or
in
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
i
see
your
reference
on
page
15
of
your
brief
to
the
committee's
report.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
what
it
is.
unknown
speaker
of
course
there
were
[voice
overlap]
that
was
on
a
minimum
wage
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
three
years
on
maximum
amount.
i'm
still
a
little
bit
bothered
if
the
congress
said
to
the
state
of
ohio,
“you
can
pay
your
employees
no
more
than
$3.94
an
hour”
what
about
those
that
have
been
getting
$5.00
an
hour
and
the
governor
himself
or
something?
that
the--did
congress
do
this?
unknown
speaker
this
rational
basis
test
can
4120
there's
a
matter
of
congressional
power
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
other
--
and
your
brothers
in
the
--
talked
about
the
tenth
amendment
on
the
other
hand.
rational
basis
is
something
that
sometimes
used
i
think
sometimes
rather
loosely
and
wrongly
used
in
connection
with
due
process,
and
sometimes
perhaps
equal
protection.
but
where
is
rational
basis
committed?
unknown
speaker
behind
the
judgment
of
congress.
unknown
speaker
to
go
farther
than
saying
that
this
is
within
the
commerce
power
of
the
congress
but
nonetheless
it's
invalid
because
it
lacks
a
rational
basis.
i
don't
have
any
case
that
holds
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
taxing
power
and
commerce
power
or
the
same
i
asked
this
because
i
think
[voice
overlap]?
unknown
speaker
why
should
they
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
those
are
quite
separate
constitutional
provisions.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
constitution
doesn't
say
it's
plenary.
unknown
speaker
of
course
this
is
the
implication
of
my
question
as
to
whether
there
isn't
a
limitation
even
on
the
commerce
power.
as
i
think
you
have
more
or
less
conceded,
there
must
be
some
although
--
unknown
speaker
what
limitation
if
it's
not
commerce?
unknown
speaker
an
interstate
commerce?
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
--
that
was
--
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
dissents
are
subversive
literature
anyway.[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that
what's
this
case
is
all
about?
unknown
speaker
does
this
apply
to
elective
public
employees
in
ohio
as
well,
to
governor
gilligan
himself
for
example?
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
not
covered
by
this
wage
increase,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
now
hadn't
--
judicial
salary
is
the
same,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
they're
separately
covered.
unknown
speaker
legislative
salary
is
the
same.
unknown
speaker
but
in
this
case
--
unknown
speaker
--
elective
officials
were
not
covered
by
this
pay
increase?
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
