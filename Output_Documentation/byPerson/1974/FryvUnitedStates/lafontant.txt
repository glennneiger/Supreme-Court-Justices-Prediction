ms.
lafontant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
economic
stabilization
act
was
brought
into
effect
in
august
of
1970
and
expired
of
its
own
terms
on
april
30,
1974.
the
act
under
section
203
authorized
the
president
to
issue
orders
and
regulations
to
stabilize
among
other
things,
salaries
and
wages,
at
levels
not
less
than
those
that
were
prevailing
on
may
25,
1970.
and
pursuant
to
such
orders
and
regulations,
the
pay
board
issued
its
own
regulations
which
limited
the
annual
wage
or
salary
increase
to
5.5%
for
all
persons
subject
to
the
regulation.
on
january
15,
1972,
the
ohio
general
assembly
passed
senate
bill
147
known
as
the
pay
bill
act
which
provided
for
an
average
increase
of
10.6%
beginning
january
1,
1972
for
65,000
of
employees
of
the
state
of
ohio,
the
state
universities
and
the
county
welfare
departments.
subsequent
thereto,
ohio
filed
an
application
for
the
pay
board
for
an
exception.
they
asked
that
they
be
permitted
to
pay
the
10.6%
increase
but
the
pay
board
permitted
them
only
to
pay
7%
from
january
1,
1972
to
march
10,
1972
but
thereafter
the
pay
board
approved
the
increase
in
its
entirety
of
10.6%.
the
ohio
supreme
court
pursuant
to
application
of
ohio,
issued
writ
of
mandamus,
commanding
the
officers
of
the
state
to
pay
the
entire
increases
--
the
officers
of
the
state
of
ohio
to
pay
the
entire
increases.
the
united
states
instituted
this
action
and
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
ohio
to
enjoin
ohio
and
its
officers
from
paying
out
the
increases
that
were
in
excess
of
those
authorized
by
the
pay
board.
and
the
district
court
restrained
ohio
from
paying
the
increases
and
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals
issued
a
permanent
injunction
on
october
25,
1973,
restraining
ohio
and
its
officers
from
paying
these
increases.
i
might
add
that
since
the
termination
of
the
economic
stabilization
act
of
--
on
april
30,
1974
there's
been
no
application
by
the
petitioners
for
dissolution
of
that
injunction
which
is
still
in
full
force
and
effect.
but
mind
you,
the
injunction
was
entered
before
the
expiration
of
the
act.
now
this
court
--
ms.
lafontant
would
we
resist?
i
would
assume
so
based
on
the
particular
facts,
we
perhaps
would
resist
it.
i
think
it
would
turn
upon
the
briefings
that
are
brought
to
us
whether
or
not
we
would
still
be
in
good
stead
in
resisting
it.
we
would
still
have
the
authority
and
we
might
not
resist
it
but
certainly
we
would
have
that
right,
and
i
can't
see
at
this
point
whether
we
would
or
would
not.
but
i
am
saying
that
the
petitioners
were
in
the
position
at
that
time
to
move
to
dissolve
the
injunction
because
the
act
was
no
longer
in
effect.
now
this
court
has
consistently
refused
to
pass
upon
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
where
at
the
time
that
it
comes
before
the
court,
the
statute
has
expired
by
its
own
terms
or
has
been
repealed
or
has
ceased
to
be
of
any
effect,
and
of
course
we
know
so
many
other
cases
that
substantiate
there
and
i
have
in
mind
in
particular
the
rice
versus
sioux
city
memorial
cemetery
case
where
after
this
court
have
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari
upon
learning
that
the
particular
state
had
repealed
its
law.
this
court
dismissed
the
writ
of
certiorari
for
being
improvidently
granted.
at
this
point
i
would
like
to
say
too
that
the
government
has
not
asked
that
this
case
be
dismissed
for
being
improvidently
granted
or
exact
languages
that
we
wanted
that
we
think
it
should
be
dismissed
because
it
is
no
longer
continuing
importance.
ms.
lafontant
yes
it
would.
and
in
the
instant
case,
the
economic
stabilization
expired
on
its
own
terms
as
i
said
on
april
30,
1974
but
of
course
this
writ
of
certiorari
was
issued
before
that
time.
now
beside
the
purely
abstract
question
of
the
right
of
ohio
to
pay
wages
to
its
employees
without
any
restraints
or
interference
from
the
federal
government,
the
only
matter
before
the
court
is
the
residual
pecuniary
interest
of
these
employees
to
the
amount
of
the
money.
that
is
some
$15
million
and
when
spread
over
all
of
the
employees
amounts
to
around
$200
or
more
for
each
employee.
the
immediate
restraint
upon
ohio
that
prevents
it
from
paying
the
money
to
the
employees
is
the
injunctive
order
of
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals.
because
of
the
fact
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
and
of
the
injunctive
order,
in
support
of
the
act
was
to
reduce
during
the
effectiveness
of
the
act
supply
of
money
in
circulation
by
putting
a
limit
on
pay
increases
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
very
substantial
question
of
law
is
now
raised
and
that
question
is
whether
upon
the
termination
of
the
act,
application
for
dissolution
of
the
injunction,
should
not
be
granted
as
a
matter
of
right
to
petitioners.
this
is
a
legal
question
that
should
be
determined.
we
respectfully
submit
that
at
the
expiration
of
the
act,
the
petitioner
should
have
made
application
to
the
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals
for
dissolution
of
the
injunction.
they
did
not
but
instead
they
chose
to
pursue
the
attack
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
itself.
we
submit
that
the
constitutionality
issue
is
of
no
longer
continuing
importance.
thus
writ
of
certiorari
was
properly
granted
because
at
that
time,
the
act
was
in
full
force
in
effect
but
since
it
has
been
granted,
the
act
has
expired
and
we
say
it's
if
no
continuing
importance,
its
not
very
likely
that
this
case
can
--
this
issue
can
arise
in
any
other
courts
concerning
wages
and
salaries
for
periods
after
april
30,
1974.
ms.
lafontant
i
don't
know
what
you're
reading
at
the
newspaper
these
days.
ms.
lafontant
well
that's
not
before
this
court
at
this
point
but
i
do
--
ms.
lafontant
i
think
a
lot
[laughter]
you
cannot
forget
it.
what
can
happen
in
the
future
or
what
will
happen
in
the
future,
i
don't
know
whether
or
not
there's
going
to
be
a
further
need
for
any
kind
of
legislation
like
this.
i
don't
know
who
can
say
but
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
has
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
an
act
that
may
be
put
into
effect
in
some
time
in
the
future.
i
think
the
court
has
to
act
on
what's
before
and
of
course
if
it
can
decide
it
without
going
into
the
constitutionality.
i
think
--
ms.
lafontant
better
word
than
may?
i
don't
know
where
i
had
the
may
at
this
point.
ms.
lafontant
and
second
--
ms.
lafontant
i
can
speak
very
honestly
to
you
and
when
i
read
this
in
mr.
brown's
reply,
i
checked
all
over
the
department.
we
have
not
filed
any
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
california
case.
we
have
filed
a
motion
for
rehearing
which
is
going
to
take
place
i
think
next
tuesday
or
wednesday
[voice
overlap]
hearing
on
that
but
we
have
not
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
i
think
before
we
--
i
could
even
answer
that.
the
department
would
have
to
look
into
all
the
aspects
of
the
case
to
see
if
one
would
be
warranted.
ms.
lafontant
that's
right,
that's
right
exactly
and
it
hasn't.
we
have
filed
our
petition
for
rehearing.
ms.
lafontant
and
i
understand,
yes.
i
understand,
let's
hope
that
it
will
be
heard
tuesday
or
wednesday
but
i
think
at
that
time,
we
would
make
a
determination
with
what
we
should
do.
but
we
have
not
filed
it
and
i
was
intending
to
clear
it
up
a
later
but
i'm
glad
you
asked
me
that
now.
ms.
lafontant
yes,
i
do
very
much
so
but
--
and
before
i
got
into
that,
i
had
one
other
issue
i
wanted
to
cover
but
would
you
prefer
that
i
get
into
it
now?
ms.
lafontant
yes,
very
definitely
we
feel
that
maryland
versus
wirtz
is
controlling
and
there
was
any
interference
into
the
role
of
state
sovereignty
that
perhaps
it
was
more
interference
in
maryland
versus
wirtz
than
here.
but
even
before
we
get
to
that,
as
you
may
have
noticed
three
of
the
amici
raised
for
the
first
time
in
issue
which
was
not
raised
by
the
petitioners.
they
contended
the
economic
stabilization
act
of
1970
doesn't
even
apply
to
the
states.
but
since
this
was
not
raised
in
the
petition,
we
don't
feel
that
it's
properly
before
the
court
but
perhaps
it
does
require
some
response.
and
in
any
event
we
feel
that
both
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
show
that
congress
intended
to
include
state
employees
in
this
act.
and
i
will
turn
to
page
12
of
our
brief
just
to
point
to
a
few
other
things
that
was
said
that
would
indicate
that.
the
regulations
define
person
to
include
any
state
or
local
government
union,
unit,
or
instrumentality
of
such
government
unit.
at
section
203
(b)
(5),
they
speak
of
--
it
sets
out
very
definitely
that
the
standards
to
be
adopted
governing
acceptable
level
of
wages
and
salaries,
would
recall
for
generally,
comparable
sacrifices
by
business
and
labor,
as
well
as
other
segments
of
the
population.
and
further,
when
senator
proxmire
at
the
senate
hearings
prefaced
his
remarks
when
he
was
introducing
a
bill
to
have
the
states
exempted.
he
conceded
that
ordinarily
higher
salaries
for
state
and
local
workers
result
in
a
greater
demand
on
the
economy
and
higher
wages
drive
prices
up,
and
that
this
is
largely
responsible
for
the
inflation
we're
suffering.
but
he
tried
to
make
a
distinction
--
ms.
lafontant
i
think
it
all
would
have
to
go
back
further
to
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
congress
would
have
a
rational
basis
for
determining
that
under
the
commerce
power
this
is
a
necessity.
ms.
lafontant
you
mean
you
said
the
federal
government
reduced
it
by
10%
for
--
ms.
lafontant
i
think
it
would
all
have
to
go
back
to
the
question
of
rational
basis
and
whether
it
was
necessary
under
the
congress
--
ms.
lafontant
oh!
no,
of
course
not
but
in
caring
it
over
to
the
states.
ms.
lafontant
yes,
definitely.
it
wouldn't
have
to
follow.
ms.
lafontant
no
i
don't
--
i
think,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
i
don't
think
congress
could
set
up
in
other
words,
the
state's
budget
and
say
--
and
control
it
completely
and
say
that
you
can
spend
so
much
and
know
more.
ms.
lafontant
i
don't.
i
think
we're
getting
pretty
far.
we're
getting
to
the
question
now
as
how
far
is
too
far
and
i
think
at
that
point,
i
would
believe
we
were
getting
a
little
too
far
and
it
certainly
it
goes
much
further
than
this
case
or
maryland
versus
wirtz.
ms.
lafontant
i
think
even
that
might
cause
a
problem.
ms.
lafontant
it
would
fear
perhaps
i
would
think
so.
well
mr.--
senator
proxmire
in
going
further
to
show
that
the
states,
that
the
congress
really
intended
to
include
the
states,
offered
his
amendment
to
specifically
exempt
from
the
act
to
salaries
of
the
state
employees.
and
senator
tower
responded
and
that's
on
page
15
of
our
brief
in
the
congressional
record
of
117.
senator
tower
said,
“i
don't
believe
it
is
fair
to
the
other
employees
to
single
out
one
particular
group
for
exemption.
i
believe
the
state
in
local
government
employees
should
be
subject
to
the
same
standards
as
other
employee
groups.
ms.
lafontant
it's
senator
proxmire,
117
congressional
record,
43-673
and
43-677.
ms.
lafontant
it's
referred
to.
ms.
lafontant
yes,
that's
what
it
is.
ms.
lafontant
yes.
and
i
might
add
that
the
proxmire
amendment
was
defeated
by
the
vote
of
56
to
35,
so
it's
no
question
in
our
mind
that
congress
intended
to
include
the
states
under
this
economic
stabilization
act.
and
even
beyond
that,
it's
just
inconceivable
that
you
would
think
that
congress
would
deliberately
exempts
a
14%
of
all
employees
when
we
were
in
such
and
emergency
situation
and
we
know
what
effect
14%
of
the
population
would
have
on
the
rest
of
the
nation.
but
they
seem
to
make
a
lot
of
out
of
the
fact
that
since
states
were
not
definitely
set
out
in
the
act
that
it
was
intended
to
omit
them.
but
we
have
cases
that
show
that
in
case
versus
bowles
is
one
of
that
shows
very
clearly,
that
just
the
fact
that
you
did
not
include
the
word
“states”
doesn't
mean
that
you
intended
to
exclude
them.
and
the
only
question
that
is
really
before
the
court
because
as
i
said,
the
three
amici
raised
this
and
not
the
petitioner.
the
only
question
presented
in
the
petitioners
where
the
congress,
under
commerce
clause
constitutionally
may
apply
economic
controls
over
the
wages
and
salaries
of
state
employees.
petitioners
contend
that
if
congress
intended
to
include
the
states
then
congress
is
violating
the
tenth
amendment,
the
sovereign
rights
of
the
states.
and
they
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
by
doing
this,
we're
permitting
the
federal
government
to
devour
the
essentials
of
state
sovereignty.
whatever
may
have
existed
with
respect
to
the
power
of
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
to
regulate
state
activities
has
been
decided
by
maryland
versus.
wirtz
,
of
course
there
where
this
court
established
the
validity
of
this
exercise
of
congressional
power
in
appropriate
circumstances
in
the
interstate
commerce.
ms.
lafontant
yes,
an
overtime.
ms.
lafontant
i
think
on
the
rational
basis
test
except
for--you
could
even
extended
that
far,
i
would
believe.
except
for
the
most
times,
i
do
exclude
the
administrative
offices
like
governor
or
what
have
you
but
i
would
say
that
once
it
would
open
the
door
and
if
there
was
this
emergency
and
if
there
was
a
rational
basis
for
it,
and
in
order
to
regulate
the
commerce
among
the
states,
and
to
defeat
the
inflation
and
fight
an
employment,
i
think
the
congress
could
actually
do
this.
but
i
think
it
has
to
be
done
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
but
i
think
in
some
instances
it
could
accomplished.
ms.
lafontant
well,
in
the
cases
that
i've
been
reading,
even
though
there
are
some
acts
that
say
that
you
don't
have
to
show
a
relationship.
i
would
believe
that
the
courts
would
have
the
power
to
go
behind
the
actions,
the
decisions
of
the
congress.
ms.
lafontant
to
go
if
--
ms.
lafontant
well
it
would
--
but
there
are
cases
to
say
that
congress,
i
mean,
that
court
does
not
have
to
accept
the
final
say
of
congress.
just
because
they
say
it's
within
the
commerce
clause.
ms.
lafontant
no,
i
don't
think
it's
the
same.
ms.
lafontant
and
the
cases
--
maybe
you're
asking
me
why
shouldn't
they
be
the
same
or
if
they
are
the
same,
the
court's
have
distinguished
between
the
taxing
power
and
commerce
power?
ms.
lafontant
right
and
they're
completely
different.
the
commerce
power
is
plenary
and
goes
much
further.
ms.
lafontant
but
the
case
law
has
restricted
the
taxing
power
in
much
more
so
than
the
commerce
power.
the
commerce
power
is
much
broader.
ms.
lafontant
yes
but
we
don't
know
where
it
stops
so
all
we
can
is
that
we
know
that
this
isn't
the
case
that
would
stop
it.
and
the
cases
have
said
that
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
commerce
power
but
we
haven't
reached
that
limitation
i
believe
in
this
case.
ms.
lafontant
well
that's
pretty
broad.
what
is
commerce?
because
so
many
--
is
there
anything
other
than
the
collecting
of
your
garbage
is
not
commerce.
ms.
lafontant
right.
ms.
lafontant
oh!
no
doubt,
yes.
ms.
lafontant
[laughter]
ms.
lafontant
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
that.
no
doubt
about
it
at
all.
this
thing
is
still
worrying
me
as
the
case
i
wanted
to
find
which
i
can't
find
right
now
on
the
point
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
in
fact,
it's
mr.
justice
stewart's
dissent
in
perez
versus
united
states.
ms.
lafontant
no,
that
was
--
that
one
was
the
on
it
had
to
do
with
the
loan
sharking.
i'm
sorry.
ms.
lafontant
right.
but
they
are
--
ms.
lafontant
as
my
opponent
said
in
his
reply
brief
that
it
was
obvious
that
we
had
not
read
the
dissent
in
maryland
versus
wirtz
because
we
had
now
quoted
from
it
but
he
did
extensively.
ms.
lafontant
true.
ms.
lafontant
well
there's
no
doubt
about
it,
yes
because
of
the
tenth
amendment.
ms.
lafontant
no,
i
hope
not.
i
think.
ms.
lafontant
well,
let's
say
--
no,
this
is
not
what
ought
this
case
is
all
about.
it
could
be
if
you
reject
the
argument
that
there
is
no
other
way
out
for
the
petitioners.
my
main
point
is
that
you
do
not
even
have
to
get
to
constitutionality
of
this
act
and
the
tenth
amendment
because
of
a
pending
injunction
which
i
believe
a
motion
should
be
made
to
dissolve
it
because
the
law
has
expired.
but
once
we
get
into
the
constitutionality
of
the
act,
the
tenth
amendment
certainly
is
part
and
parcel
of
that
whole
thing.
but
i
don't
see
how
even
in
the
tenth
amendment
how
the
state
can
really
--
ohio
can
really
argue
that
it's
sovereign
powers
are
being
impinged
upon
or
that
it's
being
forced
to
cut
back
on
certain
services
or
they
have
to
operate
a
certain
way
just
because
the
salaries
have
been
cut.
if
we
look
at
where
maryland
versus
wirtz,
there,
the
state
had
to
pay
out
money,
additional
money
to
reach
the
minimum
wage.
in
this
case,
the
wages
are
cut
back.
the
only
thing
that
you
can
really
say
that
the
state
might
be
suffering
in
which
they
alleged,
that
they're
suffering,
they
say
that
there's
a
disparity
between
state
employees
salaries
and
private
employees
salaries.
the
economic
stabilization
act
is
saying
we're
treating
you
both
the
same,
so
the
level
of
attractiveness
for
employees
remains
the
same.
they're
not
being
discriminated
against
and
both
private
and
the
state
employees
are
treated
the
same.
so
the
only
argument
that
i
would
think
they
would
have
is
if
would
be
the
argument
that
they
couldn't
attract
employees
or
couldn't
keep
their
employees.
but
i
don't
think
that
that
can
stand
out.
