we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-822,
fry
and
boehm
against
the
united
states.
mr.
brown,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.

but
if
that
were
the
general
rule
in
periods
when
there
were
“pay
freezes”
it
would
make
a
mockery
out
of
the
efforts
to
control
wages
and
crisis,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it
is
true
that
after
a
pay
freeze
is
off
such
as
we
have
during
i
think
the
korean
war
and
various
other
emergency
periods.
if
afterwards,
employers
could
come
along
and
make
it
out.
it
was
identified
as
such
it
wouldn't
have
very
much
meaning
in
terms
of
the
power
of
the
government
to
deal
with
emergencies
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
brown,
thank
you.
mrs.
lafontant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
30
odd
years
ago,
it
seems
to
me
the
federal
government
reduced
the
salaries
of
all
government
employees
some
10%
or
something
of
that
kind.
suppose
in
such
a
period
they
said
this
is
across
the
board,
all
the
federal
employees,
all
public
employees,
everywhere
else
to
pursue
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
its
own
employees
and
all
other
public
employees.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
doesn't
need
a
rational
basis
to
cut
the
salaries
on
its
own
employees
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wouldn't
gain
much
weight
for
the
state,
a
reduction
of
the
states
salaries
although
the
fact
that
they
reduce
them
for
federal.
perhaps
some
but
not
conclusive,
would
you
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
congress
would
try
to
accomplish
that
in
a
more
--that
result
in
the
more
practical
way
by
saying
it
would
terminate
all
federal
grants
in
aid
to
states
unless
states
conform
with
a
certain
policy
on
budget
and
get
out
around
robin's
barn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
equal
protection
[voice

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
total
amount
of
the
wages
paid
to
the
state
and
local
employees
in
this
country
has
an
enormous
impact
on
the
commerce
of
the
united
states,
can
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
since
we've
gone
quite
far
a
field.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
state
hypothetically
decided
to
pay
the
members
of
its
legislature
$100,000.00
a
year,
and
that
same
legislature
was
asking
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
appropriate
money
for
large
grants
to
the
state
for
highways
or
garaging
or
whatnot.
do
you
think
there
are
much
doubt
about
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
say
that
the
states
who
are
going
to
pay
$100,000.00
a
year
to
their
legislatures
aren't
going
to
get
the
same
treatment
on
federal
grants
in
aid
as
states
who
are
more
[voice
overlap]?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
don't
think
you
have
to
get
into
that
region
for
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
very
much.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
brown?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
not
now
on
the
presence
under
davis-bacon
in
effect
to
say
to
the
states
indirectly
at
least
that
you
must
pay
the
prevailing
wage
on
any
contracts,
in
which
there's
a
contribution
by
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
brown.
thank
you
mrs.
lafontant.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
73-822,
fry
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
