mrs.
lafontant,
does
your
argument
take
any
consideration
what
i
read
in
the
newspaper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
prices
are
going
up
to
the
ceiling
and
this
thing
might
be
back
in
effect
within
a
day
or
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can't
forget
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
get
can
get
a
better
word
than
may,
i
might
go
along
with
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
temporary
emergency
court
of
appeals.
in
economic
stabilization
act
of
1970
authorized
the
president
to
stabilize
wages
and
salaries
at
certain
levels,
and
created
the
pay
board
to
oversee
these
controls.
the
question
presented
by
this
case,
is
whether
the
act
was
constitutional
as
applied
by
the
pay
board
to
ohio
state
employees.
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
make
it
clear
that
congress
contemplated,
sacrifices
by
business
and
labor
as
well
as
other
segments
of
the
economy
to
implement
the
controls.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
general
raises
to
state
employees,
could
significantly
affect
interstate
commerce
and
could
thus
by
--
properly
subject
to
regulation
by
congress.
state
employees
do
not
derive
immunity
from
federal
regulation
under
the
commerce
clause
merely
because
of
their
sovereign
status.
here,
where
the
act
did
not
appreciably
intrude
on
state
sovereignty,
but
was
an
emergency
measure,
the
effectiveness
of
federal
action
would
have
been
drastically
impaired
if
wage
increases
to
state
and
legal
--
and
local
employees
were
left
outside
the
reach
of
the
act.
the
judgment
below
is
therefore
affirmed.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
separate
statement.
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
