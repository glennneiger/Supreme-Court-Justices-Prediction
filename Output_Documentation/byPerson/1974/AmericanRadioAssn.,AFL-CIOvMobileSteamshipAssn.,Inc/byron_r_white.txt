well,
let's
say
then
you're
just
saying
the
preemption
doctrine
shouldn't
apply
rather
than
arguing
that
it
was
--
that
the
impact
on
the
stevedores
for
example
was
not
arguably
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
forum?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
concede
and
still
make
your
same
argument.
you
would
concede
that
at
least
arguably
the
stevedores
would
have
a
remedy
under
8
(b)
4
before
the
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
arguably
you
could,
because
you
are
a
neutral
employer
--
you're
appealing
the
pinch?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
maybe
the
primary
employers
are
subject
to
the
act,
but
nevertheless,
you
are
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
neutral
employers
in
commerce
and
it's
subject
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway,
you're
argument
primarily
is,
even
if
that's
true,
the
preemption
doctrine
shouldn't
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
--
the
solicitor
general
seems
to
compel
to
say
that
this
is
arguably
within
the
--
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
but
nevertheless
there
should
be
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court,
is
that
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
in
case
here,
do
you
think
that
the
closest
to
worthy
injunction
against
this
kind
of
so
called
information
picketing?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
state
court
finding
here
as
to
the
public
picketing?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
finding
critical
to
your
argument?
what
i
mean
some
sort
of
finding
as
to
what
the
purpose
was,
that
it
really
wants
to
give
information
about
picketing?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that?
without
it--
without
it
you
would
be
urging
us
to
make
our
own
--
do
our
own
reading
directly?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
first
instance?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
suppose
should
the
alabama
court
come
to
proving
what
you
say
the
fact
shows?
justice
