mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
inquiry
as
to
what
the
record
show
as
to
the
purpose
and
intent.
and
mr.
right
--
mcright
commented
that
there
was
really
no
dispute
on
it
and
on
page
1
--
126
a,
the
question
was
put
to
the
petitioner's
only
witness.
my
hope
is
to
clod
up
the
port
of
mobile
with
foreign
ships,
liberian,
panamanian
to
bring
sufficient
pressure
on
the
united
states
government
to
do
something
about
the
american
merchant
marine.
that
is
your
intention?
yes
sir.
that
is
your
purpose?
this
is
in
the
record
to
me
and
to
anyone.
it's
unequivocal.
the
witness
was
a
sole
witness
presented
by
petitioners
as
a
live
witness
in
the
court
in
mobile.
this
is
the
fifth
court
that
followed
along,
has
been
on
this
issue.
and
each
court
we
go,
the
higher
we
go,
the
lower
mr.
nary
goes.
he
is
a
--
has
been
the
port
agent
for
the
petitioner
siu
in
the
port
of
mobile
for
15
years,
it
is
he
who
called
all
the
coordinating
unions
together
and
told
them
what
they
were
going
to
do.
it
is
mr.
nary
who
put
the
pickets
out
of
the
line
and
told
them
what
to
do.
but
when
we
get
to
the
highest
court
in
the
land,
he
is
reduced
to
a
man
of
menial
murdering
vagrant
murdering,
just
been
able
to
find
his
way
in
an
out
of
the
union
hall.
this
testimony
is
so
damaging
that
the
man
has
been
belittled,
and
belittled
and
belittled
the
higher
we
go
on
court.
the
time
and
the
place
of
these
pickets
are
extraordinarily
interesting.
it
came
at
the
height
of
the
grain
season
where
the
grain
must
be
harvested,
it
cannot
be
left
out
there.
these
farmers
don't
have
enough
storage
to
store
the
grain.
the
only
place
in
south
alabama,
northwest
florida
and
mississippi
for
export
grain
in
the
public
grain
elevator
at
the
state
docks
in
the
state
of
alabama
in
mobile,
when
that
gets
stopped
up,
the
grains
face
in
the
field
and
it
rots.
the
pickets
were
put
up
within
minutes
of
the
time
that
a
federal
judge
in
mobile
ordered
a
sister
union,
the
ila
is
back
to
work.
the
pickets
were
put
in
an
isolated
place
at
the
state
docks.
information
to
the
public,
the
only
public
that
was
there
were
the
ila
members,
the
petitioner's
sister
union
members
who
wouldn't
cross
their
picket
lines
and
load
and
unload
the
vessel.
the
other
element
of
the
public
was
there
where
the
foreign
seamen
assumed
they
wanted
to
see
the
signs
and
who
mr.
nary
again
testified
that
that's
what
we
wanted
to
do,
we
wanted
to
see
him,
we
wanted
them
to
start
a
dispute
where
there
are
foreign
owners,
so
that
those
owners
would
pay
them
the
equivalent
of
american
wages.
this
was
testimony
right
in
to
the
windward
case
where
it
was
held
or
noted
that
the
very
least
that
the
petitioners
in
that
case,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
would
hold
to
accomplish
would
be
to
make
the
foreign
ship
owners
raise
their
wage
and
pay
them
equivalent
wages.
the
results
were
dramatic.
the
whole
port
was
shutdown.
and
when
at
a
time
when
the
only
vessels
in
port
were
foreign
flag,
every
one
of
them
picketed.
every
one
of
them,
every
single
of
them.
that
stopped
the
port,
it
stopped
the
grain
elevator.
it
puts
the
farmer's
grain
out
in
the
fields
to
rot.
on
the
free
speech,
free
speech
with
pickets
is
free
speech
plus
and
can
be
regulated
by
the
state
within
reasonable
bounds.
logan
valley
tells
us
that
we
must
not
un-deal
or
interfere
with
the
normal
use
of
public
property.
here,
the
respondents
were
denied
the
use
of
state
docks
property
entirely,
public
property.
the
decisions
are
federal
decisions,
require
the
court
to
balance
this
freedom
of
communication,
freedom
of
speech
against
the
states
power
to
reasonably
curtail
that
freedom
of
speech.
and
this
is
what
the
trial
court
and
mobile
did
was
to
balance
these
competing
interest.
there
were
four
competent
lawyers
representing
petitioners
in
that
trial
when
the
decision
was
announced,
not
one
of
them
said,
or
judged.
how
about
telling
us
what
you
find,
the
client
did
wrong.
they
were
sitting
in
the
courtroom,
they
all
knew
and
if
they
wanted
findings,
they
could
have
at
least
requested
it
from
the
judge.
and
i
submit
--
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
yes,
they
may
request
them
but
they
are
not
always
given.
if
i
had
thought
as
a
trial
lawyer
that
the
court
had
no
basis
for
finding
anything
against
me,
i
would
have
requested
findings
and
to
prepare
the
case
for
appeal.
i'm
simply
saying
that
when
the
court
and
as
to
decision
and
send
here
on
the
record
and
ask
for
comment
from
counsel,
there
was
no
complaint
that
you
haven't
defined
exactly
what
you
said
our
clients
did
wrong.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
yes,
that
is
true.
recently
the
federal
--
essentially
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
have
been
adopted
in
the
state
but
they
were
not
so
enforced
at
the
time.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
no
sir,
this
is
a
preliminary
injunction.
that
was
the
nature
of
it,
and
then
the
case
is
still
to
be
tried
under
merits.
but
as
the
alabama
supreme
court
pointed
out,
the
court
has
wide
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
to
grant
a
preliminary
injunction
and
must
weigh
these
facts
that
i
submit
the
court
did
way.
the
trial
court
in
alabama
did
weigh.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
correct.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
it's
his
move.
if
he
wants
to
go
back
and
fight
a
lawsuit,
we
are
ready.
however,
he's
got
the
farmer
malone
in
the
federal
court,
suing
him
for
millions
dollars
in
punitive
damage
for
an
alleged
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
so,
this
is
a
case
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
mobile
where
mr.
chairman
filed
the
same
that
these
petitioners
against
farmer
malone
saying,
he
went
into
state
court
under
color
of
law
and
maliciously
and
wantingly
got
me
enjoined.
we
want
$15,000.00
normal
damages
from
farmer
malone
and
we
want
a
million
dollars,
punitive
damages
from
following
malone
and
i
want
farmer
malone
to
pay
my
attorney's
fees.
we're
talking
about
how
many
bites
you
get
out
the
apple.
that
case
is
been
--
has
been
stayed
pending
the
decision
of
this
case
before
this
court,
and
i
have
a
copy
of
the
complaint
if
the
court
would
like
to
see
it,
i'll
present
it
orderly
but
suggest
that.
if
free
speech,
if
what
they
have
done
under
the
gasp
of
free
speech
is
permitted,
then
it's
going
to
be
the
select
committee
of
the
petitioners
who
set
the
wages,
the
working
conditions
and
everything
about
foreign
seamen
or
board,
foreign
flag
vessels
calling
in
the
united
states
of
america.
if
this
count,
if
this
free
speech
claim
is
approved
by
this
court,
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
also
what's
going
to
happen
is
that
this
select
counsel
of
the
petitioners
are
going
to
tell
the
american
business
man
what
he
can
export,
to
whom
he
can
export
and
the
price
he
can
charge.
because
if
they
run
all
the
foreign
flag
vessels
out
of
here,
he
is
going
to
be
in
a
pickle
and
this
is
what
they
are
trying
to
do.
and
they
will
if
the
free
speech
is
approved
in
this
case.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
so
cause
i
gave
the
purely
informational
picketing
at
one
set
in
the
path
of
the
sisters
unions
ila
man
going
to
and
from
work,
it
didn't
take
the
port
and
tie
up
and
clod
up
the
whole
port
with
foreign
vessels,
far
different
your
honor
from
simply
notifying
the
public.
if
this
free
speech
is
approved,
then
these
select
committees
of
the
petitioners
are
going
to
be
writing
this
country's
treaties
with
every
maritime
nation
in
the
world?
because
they're
going
to
be
changing
what
happens
to
a
foreign
flag
vessel
when
it
calls
to
this
and
our
ports
if
they
have
the
right
to
run
them
off
of
our
ports
and
they
will
if
this
court
gives
them
the
right.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
i
think
liberia
has
a
treaty
with
the
united
states.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
i
think
liberia
knows
that
it
collects
yearly
tonnage
taxes
and
enrollment
taxes
and
it
likes
the
taxes
that
the
ship
owners
pay
to
liberia.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
sir?
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
i
really
--
i
couldn't
answer
that
mr.
justice
marshall
but
if
the
tax
laws
are
going
to
be
changed
so
that
you
don't
have
foreign
tax
savings.
so
that
you
don't
have
control
to
foreign
corporations,
then
this
is
something
that
congress
oath
to
do,
not
a
select
committee
of
the
petitioners
who
have
before
this
court.
the
planting
and
the
harvesting
and
the
movement
of
grain
by
the
american
farmer
is
going
to
be
controlled
by
the
select
to
committee
of
the
petitioners
because
if
they
get
all
the
foreign
bottoms
where
they
won't
call
at
our
ports,
this
is
not
going
to
be
anyway
for
other
carriage
of
these
goods
from
our
shores
to
foreign
shores.
and
on
behalf
of
farmer
malone,
i
appeal
to
this
court
not
to
permit
this
kind
of
activity
to
choke
the
american
farmer
because
this
is
what's
going
to
happen
to
him
if
the
stamp
of
approval
of
this
conduct
that
happened
in
mobile
is
given
by
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
alex
f.

it

court.

did
way.
the
trial
court
in
alabama
did
weigh.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
correct.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
it's
his
move.
if
he
wants
to
go
back
and
fight
a
lawsuit,
we
are
ready.
however,
he's
got
the
farmer
malone
in
the
federal
court,
suing
him
for
millions
dollars
in
punitive
damage
for
an
alleged
violation
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
so,
this
is
a
case
pending
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
mobile
where
mr.
chairman
filed
the
same
that
these
petitioners
against
farmer
malone
saying,
he
went
into
state
court
under
color
of
law
and
maliciously
and
wantingly
got
me
enjoined.
we
want
$15,000.00
normal
damages
from
farmer
malone
and
we
want
a
million
dollars,
punitive
damages
from
following
malone
and
i
want
farmer
malone
to
pay
my
attorney's
fees.
we're
talking
about
how
many
bites
you
get
out
the
apple.
that
case
is
been
--
has
been
stayed
pending
the
decision
of
this
case
before
this
court,
and
i
have
a
copy
of
the
complaint
if
the
court
would
like
to
see
it,
i'll
present
it
orderly
but
suggest
that.
if
free
speech,
if
what
they
have
done
under
the
gasp
of
free
speech
is
permitted,
then
it's
going
to
be
the
select
committee
of
the
petitioners
who
set
the
wages,
the
working
conditions
and
everything
about
foreign
seamen
or
board,
foreign
flag
vessels
calling
in
the
united
states
of
america.
if
this
count,
if
this
free
speech
claim
is
approved
by
this
court,
that's
what's
going
to
happen.
also
what's
going
to
happen
is
that
this
select
counsel
of
the
petitioners
are
going
to
tell
the
american
business
man
what
he
can
export,
to
whom
he
can
export
and
the
price
he
can
charge.
because
if
they
run
all
the
foreign
flag
vessels
out
of
here,
he
is
going
to
be
in
a
pickle
and
this
is
what
they
are
trying
to
do.
and
they
will
if
the
free
speech
is
approved
in
this
case.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
no
sir,
i
do
not
think
so
cause
i
gave
the
purely
informational
picketing
at
one
set
in
the
path
of
the
sisters
unions
ila
man
going
to
and
from
work,
it
didn't
take
the
port
and
tie
up
and
clod
up
the
whole
port
with
foreign
vessels,
far
different
your
honor
from
simply
notifying
the
public.
if
this
free
speech
is
approved,
then
these
select
committees
of
the
petitioners
are
going
to
be
writing
this
country's
treaties
with
every
maritime
nation
in
the
world?
because
they're
going
to
be
changing
what
happens
to
a
foreign
flag
vessel
when
it
calls
to
this
and
our
ports
if
they
have
the
right
to
run
them
off
of
our
ports
and
they
will
if
this
court
gives
them
the
right.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
i
think
liberia
has
a
treaty
with
the
united
states.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
i
think
liberia
knows
that
it
collects
yearly
tonnage
taxes
and
enrollment
taxes
and
it
likes
the
taxes
that
the
ship
owners
pay
to
liberia.
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
sir?
mr.
alex
f.
lankford,
iii
i
really
--
i
couldn't
answer
that
mr.
justice
marshall
but
if
the
tax
laws
are
going
to
be
changed
so
that
you
don't
have
foreign
tax
savings.
so
that
you
don't
have
control
to
foreign
corporations,
then
this
is
something
that
congress
oath
to
do,
not
a
select
committee
of
the
petitioners
who
have
before
this
court.
the
planting
and
the
harvesting
and
the
movement
of
grain
by
the
american
farmer
is
going
to
be
controlled
by
the
select
to
committee
of
the
petitioners
because
if
they
get
all
the
foreign
bottoms
where
they
won't
call
at
our
ports,
this
is
not
going
to
be
anyway
for
other
carriage
of
these
goods
from
our
shores
to
foreign
shores.
and
on
behalf
of
farmer
malone,
i
appeal
to
this
court
not
to
permit
this
kind
of
activity
to
choke
the
american
farmer
because
this
is
what's
going
to
happen
to
him
if
the
stamp
of
approval
of
this
conduct
that
happened
in
mobile
is
given
by
this
court.
thank
you.
