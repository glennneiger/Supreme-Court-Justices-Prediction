mr.
howard
schulman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
find
myself
back
again
in
a
return
voyage,
it
appears
like
in
the
--
on
behalf
of
merchant
seamen.
it
was
initially
i
was
here
and
on
behalf
of
questions
of
their
rights
under
the
federal
labor
act
and
we
have
an
additional
point
today
which
presented
to
the
court
of
the
free
speech
first
amendment
rights.
we
had
intended
to
devote
substantial
time
to
both
arguments.
now,
whether
on
the
light
of
a
unfortunate
reputation
by
the
solicitor
general.
again,
without
leave
of
this
court
and
submitting
an
untimely
brief
as
he
did
in
windward,
we
then
be
compelled
to
devote
a
little
more
time
to
the
presumption
argument
than
we
had
originally
contemplated.
present
here
as
distinguished
from
the
windward
case
where
in
windward,
the
claim
was
by
the
ship,
the
foreign
ship
owner.
the
conduct
of
the
unions
there
interfered
with
the
ship's
contract
among
it
seamen
and
its
internal
labor
relations.
and
for
that
reason,
this
court
determined
that
it
fell
within
the
parameters
of
the
benz
doctrine
that
the
act
was
not
applicable.
now,
we
have
a
totally
different
picture
here.
in
this
instance,
the
association
of
mobile
stevedoring
employers
brought
the
action
in
the
alabama
state
court
alleging
almost
the
verbatim
practical
provisions
of
section
8
(b)
4
of
the
act
that
these
pickets
had
directed
their
activities
to
the
stevedore
employees
of
the
association,
caused
them
to
breach
their
agreements,
induce
them
not
to
go
to
work
upon
this
foreign
vessel
and
claimed
at
that
time
that
therefore
they're
entitled
to
an
injunction.
now,
when
we
look
at
both
the
complaint
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
and
as
an
additional
respondent,
i
don't
want
to
forget
him,
a
farmer
who
has
had
some
produce
and
claimed
that
his
right
to
do
business
was
interfered
within
so
far
as
the
longshoremen
wouldn't
load
his
grain
aboard
the
vessel
or
unload
his
grain
to
put
aboard
the
vessel.
when
we
look
at
it
in
the
final
analysis
of
what
has
happened
in
the
factual
context
of
this
case,
you
have
the
alabama
state
court
not
passing
upon
their
merits
in
the
windward
case
of
the
internal
economy
of
the
vessel.
the
foreign
seamen
there
contract
with
their
ship
owner
but
on
the
contrary,
you
have
the
alabama
court
regulating
the
employer-employee
relations
existing
between
the
longshoremen
american
association
employer
and
its
employees
and
the
american
seaman
unions.
and
i
say
in
that
respect
that
this
is
conduct
when
you
examine
the
congressional
scheme
which
was
left
exclusively
to
the
competence
of
the
labor
board.
now,
there
are
many
illustrations
of
this
patent
of
conduct,
it
is
not
unique.
there
are
many
areas
where
under
the
congressional
scheme
as
determined
by
this
court
and
so
applied
where
the
underlying
dispute,
the
causes
of
dispute,
the
primary
dispute
is
without
the
competence
of
the
board.
nevertheless,
other
aspects
of
the
dispute
remained
within
the
sole
and
exclusive
authority
and
i'd
like
to
just
comment
upon
appeal
as
i
may.
i
think
for
example,
the
broome,
hattiesburg
case
where
in
that
instance,
the
labor
board
had
determined
on
a
standards
of
commerce
that
the
parties
in
that
instance
did
not
meet
the
requirements,
the
caution
for
commerce
and
determined
under
those
circumstances
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
the
primary
dispute,
there
was
no
commerce.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
conduct
complained
of,
the
secondary
conduct
within
the
congressional
scheme
of
regulating
a
conduct
of
american
employers
and
american
unions
where
within
the
exclusive
profits
of
the
board.
and
we've
had
three
cases
in
maritime
to
that
effect
and
mr.
chief
justice
may
recall
one
of
them,
he
prepared
one
of
the
arguments
in
the
grain
handlers
case
against
local
--
against
the
nlrb.
the
first
one
however
comes
out
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
you
get
the
identical
pattern
with
the
longshoremen
in
that
case
and
it's
the
local
1438
nlrb.
the
longshoremen
in
that
particular
case
were
picketing
the
vessel,
claiming
political
reasons.
the
one
of
the
issues
presented
there
was
whether
or
not
the
board
under
those
instances
because
it
was
a
foreign
flagship
owner
had
competence
to
process
such
a
complaint
or
such
a
challenge
and
the
circuit
held
yes
and
what
the
conduct
there
complained
of
nor
the
conduct
the
board
was
seeking
to
remedy
was
not
the
internal
affair
of
the
vessel
pointing
out
clearly,
that's
what
benz
inquiries
and
mcculloch
had
stood
for
at
that
posture
in
time,
then
the
contrary,
the
relationship
existing
among
american
employers,
among
american
unions
and
american
workers.
now,
the
same
context
came
up
within
the
d.c.
circuit
and
in
the
seventh
circuit
involving
canadian
vessels,
came
out
at
the
same
context,
one
at
a
preliminary
injunction
stage
and
one
in
enforcement
of
the
board
order.
and
in
those
cases,
the
unions
in
both
instances
took
the
following
position.
they
said
“look,
the
underlying
dispute
involved
here
is
one
involving
a
canadian
foreign
flag
vessel,
canadian
ship
owner
for
--
where
can
i
endure
that
distinction
quite
clearly
between
a
foreign
flagship
and
a
foreign
ship
owner.
in
that
instance
--
mr.
howard
schulman
i
read
windward,
the
court
talks
about
foreign
ship
owner.
mr.
howard
schulman
no.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
sharp
distinction,
i'm
speculating.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
the
jones
act,
yes
and
wrote
deed
as
you
have.
mr.
howard
schulman
this
court
has
and
also
under
rededus
(ph),
the
comments
directed
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
that
mcculloch
holds
that
you
can't
have
this
evaluation
as
balancing
and
nevertheless,
the
majority
--
where
dealers
majority
apparently
did
not
accept
that
and
directed
no
comments
to
it
and
again
i
assume
that
they
paid
attention
and
disagree.
now,
i
think
we're
talking
about
mr.
chief
justice,
the
windward
opinion
talks
about
foreign
ship
owner
and
i
assume
when
the
court
use
foreign
ship
owner
it
means
just
there.
and
it's
a
different
issue
and
it's
a
different
question
that's
not
before
this
court.
and
they
may
very
well
pose
a
different
issue
and
on
effect
you
got
a
foreign
flag
vessel
constructively
by
lower
american
owned.
and
as
many
these
major
petroleum
and
multi
national
corporations
exist,
the
liberia
where
there
was
no
question
and
admittedly
for
their
own
spokesman
that
these
vessels
are
american
owned
directed
by
americans
under
a
pledge
to
be
kept
that
way,
constructively
americans
and
subject
to
their
call
and
i
think
their
concerns
for
relationships
with
respect
to
what
i
refer
to
you
formistically
as
a
true
foreign
ship
owner
and
another,
i
think
it
differ
but
in
all
candid,
i
do
not
--this
case,
with
that
particular
fact
pattern
is
not
before
this
court.
now,
in
addition
to
maritime
and
in
addition
to
questions
of
whether
or
not
the
volume
of
the
business
keeps
a
particular
employer
within
the
coverage
of
the
act,
there
are
other
instances
as
well.
example,
the
railroad,
this
courts
decision
in
new
york
newhaven,
local
25.
there,
the
underlying
dispute
involved
there
was
not
within
any
competence
of
the
act.
and
yet
this
court
held
as
another
demonstration
then
under
those
circumstances,
what
the
complaint
of,
what
are
the
party
complaining
up
there
was
this
secondary
conduct
within
the
competence
of
the
labor
board
and
if
this
was
part
of
congress's
scheme,
i
think
the
last
illustration,
i'm
sure
there's
many
more,
the
last
one
that
i
could
possibly
come
across
is
the
agriculture
industry.
that
the
agricultural
industry
is
not
within
the
board's
competence
and
nevertheless,
there
are
cases
and
we
cite
the
ninth
circuit
enforcing
the
san
francisco
labor
counsel
but
not
withstanding
the
dispute
with
the
farm
labor,
the
chavez
group.
nevertheless,
american
union
subject
to
the
act,
american
employers,
the
labor
board
has
jurisdiction,
exclusive
jurisdiction
at
least
under
garmon,
its
arguable
prohibited.
now,
this
is
what
i
see
and
but
what
we
see
what
this
case
is
all
about.
the
solicitor
general,
the
government
composes
that
it
doesn't
--
the
analogy
we
gave
where
the
authorities
doesn't
apply
and
cites
hanna
mining
and
i
think
i
like
to
direct
a
few
minutes
attention
to
this
court's
holding
in
hanna
mining.
hanna
mining
case
was
an
attempt
by
an
american
officer's
union
to
engage
in
picketing
waters
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
compel
the
supervisors
and
compel
the
employer
as
well
to
make
these
supervisors
join
the
unions.
and
the
case
came
before
this
court
and
to
go
to
wisconsin
court
finding
that
that
conduct
was
arguably
within
the
can
off
or
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
mr.
late
--
mr.
justice
harlan
made
quite
clear
in
that
case
that
the
conduct
which
was
sought
to
be
remedy
finding
no
such
preemption
was
conduct
which
would
go
unregulated
which
congress
in
its
scheme
said
the
labor
board
should
not
regulate
and
that
to
come
down
with
a
result
and
to
find
that
the
state
court
is
preempted
by
the
labor
board
would
leave
that
conduct
totally
uncontrolled.
and
in
that
instance,
on
the
--
i
think
that
mr.
justice
brennan
held
in
his
concurring
opinion.
the
union
there,
we're
just
complaining
incidentally
there
with
secondary
conduct
but
the
core
is
a
language
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
used
the
vital
core
of
the
dispute,
was
the
attempt
by
the
engineer's
union
to
organize
these
people
through
economic
force
and
that
was
any
of
the
desires
of
their
member
which
was
not
controllable
at
all,
even
under
the
federal
court
particularly
in
view
of
section
8
(b)
7,
and
the
fact
that
the
supervisors
i
should
say
are
without
the
structure
of
it.
now,
that
is
a
world's
apart
totally
different
analogy
of
context
in
any
sense
of
arguing
with
this
case.
here,
the
foreign
ship
owner,
if
he
has
a
cause
to
believe
as
a
remedy
in
the
state
court,
we
can
take
whole
of
any
conduct
which
interferes
with
an
attempt
to
breech
the
agreements
between
the
foreign
seamen
and
the
foreign
ship
owner,
the
articles,
the
contract.
and
when
--
in
hanna
mining,
the
result
as
determined
by
the
wisconsin
court
did
not
permit
of
that
and
i
am
directed
to
in
substance
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
congressional
scheme,
i
think
we
all
come
back
to
that
again
as
to
what
congress
had
in
mind
as
motivations
in
purposes
this
were.
congress
had
in
mind
that
american
employers
and
american
unions
--
american
working
men
most
significantly
had
certain
rights,
their
accommodations
and
their
adjustments.
and
that
8
(b)
4
encompasses
all
that
legislative
history
on
debate
so
that
not
only
a
certain
conduct
intended
to
be
prohibited
involving
neutrals
but
there
is
also
certain
rights
protected
activity
which
congress
determined
should
be
exercised
by
american
workers.
i
find
frankly
to
be
subjectively
quite
along
solicitor
general's
proposal
of
what
he
calls
concurrent
jurisdiction.
what
do
you
say,
but
he's
asking
this
court
to
do,
not
withstanding
all
his
legislative
history
is
the
following.
he
says
“insofar
what
affects
the
secondary
conduct
as
in
this
case.”
and
you
look
at
page
29
of
the
appendix
of
the
alabama
supreme
court's
injunction
and
they
don't
say
a
word
about
the
foreign
vessel.
they
just
regulate
my
client's
conduct
and
this
employer
for
all
vessels,
american
or
otherwise
as
if
this
was
a
typical
garden
variety
labor
board
injunction.
and
the
solicitor
general
says
by
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
that
regulation,
of
that
secondary
conduct
should
be
in
effect
by
force,
not
under
federal
law
though,
not
like
under
section
301
of
the
act
for
breech
of
contract
or
section
303
for
damages
for
violation
(inaudible)
where
state
courts
have
jurisdiction,
concurrent
jurisdiction
but
must
deployed
federal
law,
oh
no.
the
solicitor
general
opts
for
a
situation
whereas
my
friends
on
the
other
side
get
two
bites
of
the
apple,
not
one
and
maybe
other
people
will
get
equivalent
two
bites.
he
says
there's
concurrent
jurisdiction
between
the
labor
board
under
one
hand
to
take
a
look
into
it
to
see
whether
conduct
is
prohibited
or
whether
it's
not
violative.
and
on
the
other
hand,
it's
a
right
of
the
party
to
go
to
state
courts.
i
frankly
find
this
totally
at
odd
with
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
are
relative
to
intent
of
the
act
and
we're
talking
about
secondary
board
of
conduct
and
the
need
for
uniformity
and
section
10
(a)
is
command
for
exclusivity.
i
find
other
interest
in
fact
as
coming
out
of
it,
you
could
arrive
at
a
situation
where
peoples
such
as
the
respondents
here
could
go
into
a
state
court
and
get
relief
under
state
law
where
there's
a
yellow
lonely
guy
and
do
some
breech
of
contracts
of
other
concept
for
which
the
top
court
of
alabama
may
affirm
and
which
there's
no
federal
question
to
come
before
this
court.
yet
another
party
goes
before
the
labor
board
and
the
labor
board's
case
comes
before
this
court
and
he
get
it
diametrically
uphold
the
situation.
that's
only
some
of
the
errors,
there's
more
significant
errors.
here,
i
believe
30
somewhat
to
coastal
stage,
were
on
water
in
this
country.
i
believe
they
have
30
somewhat
interpretations,
but
then
they
gave
on
the
states
as
the
impact
to
secondary
boycotts,
that
would
be
totally
violative
at
the
congressional
intent.
how
do
you
similar
problems
with
the
solicitor
general's
conduct?
norris
laguardia
was
an
intrical
part
of
our
labor
policy
which
says
federal
courts
generally
are
prohibited
from
issuing
injunctions.
and
yet
code
of
that
1635
and
congressional
legislative
scheme
norris-laguardia
is
to
reserve
solely
to
the
federal
system
certain
conduct
which
carries
with
it
that
state
courts
are
not
to
act
on
it
and
the
same
state
court
absent
little
norris-laguardia
act
have
no
such
proscription,
we
wind
up
again
under
this
opted
for
policy
coming
out
at
the
extreme
once
again.
and
finally,
in
connection
with
somebody
that
appears
to
me
to
be
similar,
our
stories
is
the
question
of
section
10
(a)
in
its
expressed
congressional
attempt
of
ceding
the
board
jurisdiction
but
it's
got
to
be
consistent
with
the
act.
there's
got
to
be
an
agreement
consistent
with
it
and
the
law
must
be
equally
applied.
and
under
the
solicitor
general's
contention,
we
totally
violate
each
and
every
one
of
those
terms
and
provisions.
i
think
there
is
of
course
an
even
more
significant
point.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
windward
opinion
cited
this
courts
lorensen
--
lorensen
case.
the
footnote
there
of
brush
appeals
and
that
brush
appeals
are
the
same
in
those
instances
who
wanted
this
court
to
legislate
the
fact.
i
say
this
is
equally
of
nothing
more
a
brush
attack
but
the
solicitor
general
would
do
that
but
there's
something
more
significant
which
was
not
present
in
either
lorensen
or
in
(inaudible).
since
this
case,
there
has
been
proposed
in
both
houses,
legislation
which
seeks
to
preserve
domestic
employment
opportunities
for
american
seamen
and
that's
what
they
we're
engaged
here.
it's
known
as
the
energy

act
of
1974,
extensive
hearings
were
held.

and

argument
he's
making

his

and
the
economy
was
not
successful.
for
whatever
reason,
whether
they
disagree
or
found
no
basis
or
made
the
adjustment,
congress
has
moot
and
congress
has
passed
out
bill
in
the
following
manner.
the
bill
was
passed
over
one
merely
in
a
house,
rejecting
the
state
department's
proposals,
overwhelmingly
in
the
senate,
the
conferees
of
both
houses
have
met,
the
reports
of
the
conferees
has
been
acted
upon
by
the
house
and
accept
overwhelmingly.
the
senate's
report
will
be
acted
upon
by
just
recently
over
the
recess.
but
equally
significant
is
that
the
solicitor
general
recognized.
now,
the
prop
before
and
where
to
go
with
this
sort
of
argument
is
not
to
drag
people
with
this
court.
mr.
howard
schulman
the
energy
transportation
security?
mr.
howard
schulman
and
we
have
it
in
our
brief,
cited
in
another
brief.
mr.
howard
schulman
well,
what
the
law
says
is
that
import
of
american
oil,
of
petroleum
products
in
this
country,
it's
got
to
be
carried
30%
of
the
30%
in
american
flagships
as
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
one
of
the
purposes
as
expressed
by
senate
alone.
the
law
in
colloquy
with
the
assistant
secretary
of
commerce
was
to
make
sure
that
there's
a
domestic
employment
opportunities
for
american
seamen.
mr.
howard
schulman
imports
of
petroleum
products.
mr.
howard
schulman
petroleum,
carriage
of
petroleum
products
into
our
country.
mr.
howard
schulman
correct,
up
to
30%.
mr.
howard
schulman
no
by
1977
as
a
graduated
scale.
by
1977,
it's
got
to
be
full
30%.
mr.
howard
schulman
certain
rights
are
reserved
in
light
of
emergency
obviously
to
suspend
upon
action
of
the
executive
legislative
fringe.
mr.
howard
schulman
doesn't
have
any
bearing
on
it.
no,
other
than
it
demonstrates
to
me
that
each
and
every
one
of
the
arguments
the
solicitor
has
used
here,
and
its
briefs
submitted
to
this
court.
he
has
used
before
congress
and
we
so
demonstrate
it
in
our
supplemental
brief
and
we
cite
where
it's
used.
and
then
each
and
every
instance,
the
court
as
to
the
congress
has
just
rejected.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
and
that's
what
i
believe
however.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
i
think
the
solicitor
is
asking
you
for
--
of
course
when
you
read
his
brief,
he
talks
about
their
concerns.
he
is
saying
this
should
be
so
because
of
the
concern
for
prior
relations.
this
should
be
so
because
of
concern
for
national
affairs.
this
should
be
so
because
the
concern
for
the
economy.
each
and
every
instance
that
to
me
it
presents
an
issue
purely
legislative
and
equally
significant
made
by
secretary,
the
secretary
of
the
state
as
well
as
other
agencies
administered
government
taking
the
branch
to
congress
and
not
accept
it,
and
that
to
me
is
a
brush
appeal.
maybe
my
subjective
pleading
as
in
advert
to
get
us
a
little
color
but
what
appear
to
me
and
if
you've
gone
to
one
forum
body
and
you
rejected
there,
it
doesn't
suit
well
to
look
for
another
suitor
or
to
go
to
another
forum,
you
go
shopping,
and
i
submit
and
so
submit
state,
i
believe
this
was
the
solicitor
is
doing
here,
doing
just
that.
i
see
i
have
just
a
few
moments
and
i
just
like
to
direct
a
few
remarks
to
first
amendment
argument,
the
free
speech
argument.
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
talking
about
the
conduct
involved
here.
the
conduct
involved
was
the
same
conduct
we
wind,
of
the
same
conduct
of
national
policy
action
of
this
which
is
all
over
the
country.
new
picket
sending
out
signs,
asking
for
help
and
assistance
protected
jobs.
alabama
supreme
court
says
in
approaching
that
issue
that
first
of
all,
it
has
the
right
not
withstanding
i
submit,
first
before
to
the
amendment
to
seize
and
issue
a
notice
restricting
all
picketing
pending
that's
looking
in
to
the
purpose
of
objects
where
the
effects
may
affect
the
national
economy
of
the
state.
and
as
i
read
this,
is
the
prohibited
conduct
which
this
court
express,
in
thornhil
up
to
kiff
of
a
blanket
provision
saying
when
that
affects
the
national
economy
of
our
local
area
that
our
state
policy
is
that
all
injunct
or
picketing
is
to
be
restrained,
we
know
of
no
such
authority
to
that
effect.
i
do
not
think
that
a
state
possesses
that
right
on
the
mere
expression
that
it
may
affect
local
economy
to
stop
all
free
speech.
that
has
not
given,
that
is
not
bought,
that
is
not
hankey
and
the
other
cases
authorizing
labor
disputes,
state
valid
policy
and
the
demand
open
to
them
for
specific
conduct
to
restrict
the
specific
conduct
such
as
anti
monopolist.
and
i
think
there's
more
in
this
case
if
we
find
argument
in
the
brief.
in
addition
to
that,
alabama
says,
wrongful
interference
and
nothing
more,
just
the
two
words,
wrongful
interference,
the
person's
right
to
do
business
with
the
matter
of
state
policy
may
enjoin
picketing.
i
submit
or
patent
in
the
economy,
i
submit,
that
runs
directly
about
this
court's
decision
in
kiff
where
the
man
was
engaged
in
business
at
his
house.
that
goes
the
problem
i
believe.
alabama
may
not
so
broadly
restrain,
have
not
established
the
confines,
the
valid
state
for
the
policy
assuming
the
domain
is
open
to
them,
assuming
there's
no
preemption.
and
finally,
we
have
involved
here
what
i
think
in
the
final
analysis
is
alabama
making
a
finding
by
its
supreme
court
when
the
district
court
and
the
local
court
made
no
findings
effect
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
answering
objection
to
that
say,
well,
they
must
have
made
certain
findings
otherwise
they
wouldn't
have
issued
the
injunction.
i
guess
under
those
circumstances,
we
don't
need
appellate
courts
but
not
withstanding
that.
the
issue
which
we
have
presented
there
and
we
enumerated
quite
bit
in
our
brief
is
that
they've
hit
upon
a
personal
hope
and
desire
of
a
very
low
official
who
testified
under
very
scheme
for
cross
examination
my
good
friend
prompt
me
corrected
it,
as
to
his
personal
hopes
and
desires,
what
he
would
personally
like
to
see
and
admittedly
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
campaign
other
than
to
serve
the
picket
lines
and
carry
the
instructions
out.
and
based
upon
that,
the
court
said,
the
purpose
of
this
picketing
may
have
been
to
tie
up
the
whole
harbor
until
congress
brought
some
legislation
to
bring
the
whole
harbor
down.
and
i
say,
under
this
courts
decision
in
grain,
we
need
to
search
the
record
to
find
subsisting
facts,
essential
facts
to
warrant
the
restrictions
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
should
be
made
in
this
case
and
i
think
when
they're
made
in
this
case,
there
is
no
finding
that
the
conduct
of
this
individual,
his
own
personal
hopes
and
expectations
could
be
charged
against
the
conduct
of
this
committee
and
his
thousands
of
american
seamen
was
merely
exercising
a
fundamental
right.
i
reserve
the
few
moments
left
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
a
few
things
your
honor.
i
would
have
thought
at
listening
to
my
friends,
i
wonder
windward
case
not
lost.
well
as
calamities
talk
about
tangled
ports,
well
that's
what
this
court
decided
in
windward,
the
foreign
ship
owner
can
go
into
court
and
enjoin
the
picketing.
i
don't
understand
why
all
this
foreign
vessels
are
not
going
to
call
at
their
ports.
there
isn't
any
basis
at
all
to
their
argument
and
i
think
any
question
about
the
motivations
of
the
people
i
represent
or
the
farmer
involved
as
to
what's
concerned
there,
that
should
be
better
directed
to
congress.
the
elected
director
remarked
that
both
mr.
justice
marshall
or
mr.
justice
white
i
believe
asked
my
friends
relative
to
the
findings
being
made
by
the
state
court.
i'm
reading
now
from
page
28
of
the
appendix.
the
trial
judge
decree
granting
writ
of
temporary
injunction
made
no
finding
of
fact
from
the
evidence
that
is
complete
and
absolute.
but
apparently,
the
trial
judge
found
from
the
evidence
that
there
was
wrongful
interference
by
the
appellants,
with
the
appellees
business
or
other
wise,
he
would
not
have
ordered
the
writ
of
temporary
injunction
to
issue.
and
the
answer
to
that,
there
was
no
finding
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
just
makes
that
indication
on
an
assumption.
mr.
howard
schulman
28
of
the
--
mr.
howard
schulman
of
the
appendix.
mr.
howard
schulman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
howard
schulman
28.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes
and
from
which
it
says
we
--
mr.
howard
schulman
yes.
mr.
howard
schulman
that
that
it
may
have
been
at
the
court
below
may
have
based
upon
that.
mr.
howard
schulman
inequity,
yes.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
but
whether
that
meets
the
standards
necessary
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
i
think
it's
a
different
question.
mr.
howard
schulman
with
respect
to
the
situation
involving
hanna
and
the
windward,
in
both
those
instances,
the
state
court
regulated
otherwise
unregulated
conduct.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
otherwise
unregulated
--
the
otherwise
conduct
involved
here
is
the
secondary
aspect
regulate
above
the
labor
board.
now,
with
respect
to
this
talk
about
the
record
as
to
the
position
of
witnesses
and
an
intend
to
place
this
court's
time
and
discussing
that
other
minute
set
forth
in
the
record,
in
the
position
of
this
mr.
nary
and
whether
there
was
adequate
evidence
upon
which
a
court
could
move
in
and
say
all
these
rights
of
this
tens
of
thousands
of
american
seamen
suddenly
abrogated.
i
think
it's
a
requirement
to
search
their
record
and
determine
that
under
the
grain
case,
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
the
necessary
quantum
to
warrant
such
restriction
as
the
alabama
court
did
here.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
that
is
not
the
--
it
isn't
because
of
titles,
no,
it's
because
of
the
substantive
nature
of
the
complaint.
in
the
windward
case,
the
unions
were
accused
of
interfering
and
trying
to
change
the
contractual.
as
this
court
said,
they
must
have
hope
or
expected.
they
would
have
given
more
money.
therefore,
it
falls
under
benz
which
holds,
it
involves
the
internal
operation
of
the
vessels.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
the
difference
here
is
that
there's
--
this
is
not
the
issue
of
this
plaint
here
--
plaintiff
here,
is
not
to
regulate
the
conduct
to
foreign
ship
owner.
he
is
saying
picketing
is
stopping
him
from
doing
business.
that's
referring
with
this.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
that's
an
8
(b)
4.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
that's
exclusive
in
labor
board,
mr.
justice
brennan.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
schulman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
find
myself
back
again
in
a
return
voyage,
it
appears
like
in
the
--
on
behalf
of
merchant
seamen.
it
was
initially
i
was
here
and
on
behalf
of
questions
of
their
rights
under
the
federal
labor
act
and
we
have
an
additional
point
today
which
presented
to
the
court
of
the
free
speech
first
amendment
rights.
we
had
intended
to
devote
substantial
time
to
both
arguments.
now,
whether
on
the
light
of
a
unfortunate
reputation
by
the
solicitor
general.
again,
without
leave
of
this
court
and
submitting
an
untimely
brief
as
he
did
in
windward,
we
then
be
compelled
to
devote
a
little
more
time
to
the
presumption
argument
than
we
had
originally
contemplated.
present
here
as
distinguished
from
the
windward
case
where
in
windward,
the
claim
was
by
the
ship,
the
foreign
ship
owner.
the
conduct
of
the
unions
there
interfered
with
the
ship's
contract
among
it
seamen
and
its
internal
labor
relations.
and
for
that
reason,
this
court
determined
that
it
fell
within
the
parameters
of
the
benz
doctrine
that
the
act
was
not
applicable.
now,
we
have
a
totally
different
picture
here.
in
this
instance,
the
association
of
mobile
stevedoring
employers
brought
the
action
in
the
alabama
state
court
alleging
almost
the
verbatim
practical
provisions
of
section
8
(b)
4
of
the
act
that
these
pickets
had
directed
their
activities
to
the
stevedore
employees
of
the
association,
caused
them
to
breach
their
agreements,
induce
them
not
to
go
to
work
upon
this
foreign
vessel
and
claimed
at
that
time
that
therefore
they're
entitled
to
an
injunction.
now,
when
we
look
at
both
the
complaint
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
and
as
an
additional
respondent,
i
don't
want
to
forget
him,
a
farmer
who
has
had
some
produce
and
claimed
that
his
right
to
do
business
was
interfered
within
so
far
as
the
longshoremen
wouldn't
load
his
grain
aboard
the
vessel
or
unload
his
grain
to
put
aboard
the
vessel.
when
we
look
at
it
in
the
final
analysis
of
what
has
happened
in
the
factual
context
of
this
case,
you
have
the
alabama
state
court
not
passing
upon
their
merits
in
the
windward
case
of
the
internal
economy
of
the
vessel.
the
foreign
seamen
there
contract
with
their
ship
owner
but
on
the
contrary,
you
have
the
alabama
court
regulating
the
employer-employee
relations
existing
between
the
longshoremen
american
association
employer
and
its
employees
and
the
american
seaman
unions.
and
i
say
in
that
respect
that
this
is
conduct
when
you
examine
the
congressional
scheme
which
was
left
exclusively
to
the
competence
of
the
labor
board.
now,
there
are
many
illustrations
of
this
patent
of
conduct,
it
is
not
unique.
there
are
many
areas
where
under
the
congressional
scheme
as
determined
by
this
court
and
so
applied
where
the
underlying
dispute,
the
causes
of
dispute,
the
primary
dispute
is
without
the
competence
of
the
board.
nevertheless,
other
aspects
of
the
dispute
remained
within
the
sole
and
exclusive
authority
and
i'd
like
to
just
comment
upon
appeal
as
i
may.
i
think
for
example,
the
broome,
hattiesburg
case
where
in
that
instance,
the
labor
board
had
determined
on
a
standards
of
commerce
that
the
parties
in
that
instance
did
not
meet
the
requirements,
the
caution
for
commerce
and
determined
under
those
circumstances
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
over
the
primary
dispute,
there
was
no
commerce.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
in
that
case
that
conduct
complained
of,
the
secondary
conduct
within
the
congressional
scheme
of
regulating
a
conduct
of
american
employers
and
american
unions
where
within
the
exclusive
profits
of
the
board.
and
we've
had
three
cases
in
maritime
to
that
effect
and
mr.
chief
justice
may
recall
one
of
them,
he
prepared
one
of
the
arguments
in
the
grain
handlers
case
against
local
--
against
the
nlrb.
the
first
one
however
comes
out
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
you
get
the
identical
pattern
with
the
longshoremen
in
that
case
and
it's
the
local
1438
nlrb.
the
longshoremen
in
that
particular
case
were
picketing
the
vessel,
claiming
political
reasons.
the
one
of
the
issues
presented
there
was
whether
or
not
the
board
under
those
instances
because
it
was
a
foreign
flagship
owner
had
competence
to
process
such
a
complaint
or
such
a
challenge
and
the
circuit
held
yes
and
what
the
conduct
there
complained
of
nor
the
conduct
the
board
was
seeking
to
remedy
was
not
the
internal
affair
of
the
vessel
pointing
out
clearly,
that's
what
benz
inquiries
and
mcculloch
had
stood
for
at
that
posture
in
time,
then
the
contrary,
the
relationship
existing
among
american
employers,
among
american
unions
and
american
workers.
now,
the
same
context
came
up
within
the
d.c.
circuit
and
in
the
seventh
circuit
involving
canadian
vessels,
came
out
at
the
same
context,
one
at
a
preliminary
injunction
stage
and
one
in
enforcement
of
the
board
order.
and
in
those
cases,
the
unions
in
both
instances
took
the
following
position.
they
said
“look,
the
underlying
dispute
involved
here
is
one
involving
a
canadian
foreign
flag
vessel,
canadian
ship
owner
for
--
where
can
i
endure
that
distinction
quite
clearly
between
a
foreign
flagship
and
a
foreign
ship
owner.
in
that
instance
--
mr.
howard
schulman
i
read
windward,
the
court
talks
about
foreign
ship
owner.
mr.
howard
schulman
no.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
sharp
distinction,
i'm
speculating.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
the
jones
act,
yes
and
wrote
deed
as
you
have.
mr.
howard
schulman
this
court
has
and
also
under
rededus
(ph),
the
comments
directed
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
that
mcculloch
holds
that
you
can't
have
this
evaluation
as
balancing
and
nevertheless,
the
majority
--
where
dealers
majority
apparently
did
not
accept
that
and
directed
no
comments
to
it
and
again
i
assume
that
they
paid
attention
and
disagree.
now,
i
think
we're
talking
about
mr.
chief
justice,
the
windward
opinion
talks
about
foreign
ship
owner
and
i
assume
when
the
court
use
foreign
ship
owner
it
means
just
there.
and
it's
a
different
issue
and
it's
a
different
question
that's
not
before
this
court.
and
they
may
very
well
pose
a
different
issue
and
on
effect
you
got
a
foreign
flag
vessel
constructively
by
lower
american
owned.
and
as
many
these
major
petroleum
and
multi
national
corporations
exist,
the
liberia
where
there
was
no
question
and
admittedly
for
their
own
spokesman
that
these
vessels
are
american
owned
directed
by
americans
under
a
pledge
to
be
kept
that
way,
constructively
americans
and
subject
to
their
call
and
i
think
their
concerns
for
relationships
with
respect
to
what
i
refer
to
you
formistically
as
a
true
foreign
ship
owner
and
another,
i
think
it
differ
but
in
all
candid,
i
do
not
--this
case,
with
that
particular
fact
pattern
is
not
before
this
court.
now,
in
addition
to
maritime
and
in
addition
to
questions
of
whether
or
not
the
volume
of
the
business
keeps
a
particular
employer
within
the
coverage
of
the
act,
there
are
other
instances
as
well.
example,
the
railroad,
this
courts
decision
in
new
york
newhaven,
local
25.
there,
the
underlying
dispute
involved
there
was
not
within
any
competence
of
the
act.
and
yet
this
court
held
as
another
demonstration
then
under
those
circumstances,
what
the
complaint
of,
what
are
the
party
complaining
up
there
was
this
secondary
conduct
within
the
competence
of
the
labor
board
and
if
this
was
part
of
congress's
scheme,
i
think
the
last
illustration,
i'm
sure
there's
many
more,
the
last
one
that
i
could
possibly
come
across
is
the
agriculture
industry.
that
the
agricultural
industry
is
not
within
the
board's
competence
and
nevertheless,
there
are
cases
and
we
cite
the
ninth
circuit
enforcing
the
san
francisco
labor
counsel
but
not
withstanding
the
dispute
with
the
farm
labor,
the
chavez
group.
nevertheless,
american
union
subject
to
the
act,
american
employers,
the
labor
board
has
jurisdiction,
exclusive
jurisdiction
at
least
under
garmon,
its
arguable
prohibited.
now,
this
is
what
i
see
and
but
what
we
see
what
this
case
is
all
about.
the
solicitor
general,
the
government
composes
that
it
doesn't
--
the
analogy
we
gave
where
the
authorities
doesn't
apply
and
cites
hanna
mining
and
i
think
i
like
to
direct
a
few
minutes
attention
to
this
court's
holding
in
hanna
mining.
hanna
mining
case
was
an
attempt
by
an
american
officer's
union
to
engage
in
picketing
waters
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
to
compel
the
supervisors
and
compel
the
employer
as
well
to
make
these
supervisors
join
the
unions.
and
the
case
came
before
this
court
and
to
go
to
wisconsin
court
finding
that
that
conduct
was
arguably
within
the
can
off
or
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
mr.
late
--
mr.
justice
harlan
made
quite
clear
in
that
case
that
the
conduct
which
was
sought
to
be
remedy
finding
no
such
preemption
was
conduct
which
would
go
unregulated
which
congress
in
its
scheme
said
the
labor
board
should
not
regulate
and
that
to
come
down
with
a
result
and
to
find
that
the
state
court
is
preempted
by
the
labor
board
would
leave
that
conduct
totally
uncontrolled.
and
in
that
instance,
on
the
--
i
think
that
mr.
justice
brennan
held
in
his
concurring
opinion.
the
union
there,
we're
just
complaining
incidentally
there
with
secondary
conduct
but
the
core
is
a
language
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
used
the
vital
core
of
the
dispute,
was
the
attempt
by
the
engineer's
union
to
organize
these
people
through
economic
force
and
that
was
any
of
the
desires
of
their
member
which
was
not
controllable
at
all,
even
under
the
federal
court
particularly
in
view
of
section
8
(b)
7,
and
the
fact
that
the
supervisors
i
should
say
are
without
the
structure
of
it.
now,
that
is
a
world's
apart
totally
different
analogy
of
context
in
any
sense
of
arguing
with
this
case.
here,
the
foreign
ship
owner,
if
he
has
a
cause
to
believe
as
a
remedy
in
the
state
court,
we
can
take
whole
of
any
conduct
which
interferes
with
an
attempt
to
breech
the
agreements
between
the
foreign
seamen
and
the
foreign
ship
owner,
the
articles,
the
contract.
and
when
--
in
hanna
mining,
the
result
as
determined
by
the
wisconsin
court
did
not
permit
of
that
and
i
am
directed
to
in
substance
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
congressional
scheme,
i
think
we
all
come
back
to
that
again
as
to
what
congress
had
in
mind
as
motivations
in
purposes
this
were.
congress
had
in
mind
that
american
employers
and
american
unions
--
american
working
men
most
significantly
had
certain
rights,
their
accommodations
and
their
adjustments.
and
that
8
(b)
4
encompasses
all
that
legislative
history
on
debate
so
that
not
only
a
certain
conduct
intended
to
be
prohibited
involving
neutrals
but
there
is
also
certain
rights
protected
activity
which
congress
determined
should
be
exercised
by
american
workers.
i
find
frankly
to
be
subjectively
quite
along
solicitor
general's
proposal
of
what
he
calls
concurrent
jurisdiction.
what
do
you
say,
but
he's
asking
this
court
to
do,
not
withstanding
all
his
legislative
history
is
the
following.
he
says
“insofar
what
affects
the
secondary
conduct
as
in
this
case.”
and
you
look
at
page
29
of
the
appendix
of
the
alabama
supreme
court's
injunction
and
they
don't
say
a
word
about
the
foreign
vessel.
they
just
regulate
my
client's
conduct
and
this
employer
for
all
vessels,
american
or
otherwise
as
if
this
was
a
typical
garden
variety
labor
board
injunction.
and
the
solicitor
general
says
by
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
that
regulation,
of
that
secondary
conduct
should
be
in
effect
by
force,
not
under
federal
law
though,
not
like
under
section
301
of
the
act
for
breech
of
contract
or
section
303
for
damages
for
violation
(inaudible)
where
state
courts
have
jurisdiction,
concurrent
jurisdiction
but
must
deployed
federal
law,
oh
no.
the
solicitor
general
opts
for
a
situation
whereas
my
friends
on
the
other
side
get
two
bites
of
the
apple,
not
one
and
maybe
other
people
will
get
equivalent
two
bites.
he
says
there's
concurrent
jurisdiction
between
the
labor
board
under
one
hand
to
take
a
look
into
it
to
see
whether
conduct
is
prohibited
or
whether
it's
not
violative.
and
on
the
other
hand,
it's
a
right
of
the
party
to
go
to
state
courts.
i
frankly
find
this
totally
at
odd
with
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
are
relative
to
intent
of
the
act
and
we're
talking
about
secondary
board
of
conduct
and
the
need
for
uniformity
and
section
10
(a)
is
command
for
exclusivity.
i
find
other
interest
in
fact
as
coming
out
of
it,
you
could
arrive
at
a
situation
where
peoples
such
as
the
respondents
here
could
go
into
a
state
court
and
get
relief
under
state
law
where
there's
a
yellow
lonely
guy
and
do
some
breech
of
contracts
of
other
concept
for
which
the
top
court
of
alabama
may
affirm
and
which
there's
no
federal
question
to
come
before
this
court.
yet
another
party
goes
before
the
labor
board
and
the
labor
board's
case
comes
before
this
court
and
he
get
it
diametrically
uphold
the
situation.
that's
only
some
of
the
errors,
there's
more
significant
errors.
here,
i
believe
30
somewhat
to
coastal
stage,
were
on
water
in
this
country.
i
believe
they
have
30
somewhat
interpretations,
but
then
they
gave
on
the
states
as
the
impact
to
secondary
boycotts,
that
would
be
totally
violative
at
the
congressional
intent.
how
do
you
similar
problems
with
the
solicitor
general's
conduct?
norris
laguardia
was
an
intrical
part
of
our
labor
policy
which
says
federal
courts
generally
are
prohibited
from
issuing
injunctions.
and
yet
code
of
that
1635
and
congressional
legislative
scheme
norris-laguardia
is
to
reserve
solely
to
the
federal
system
certain
conduct
which
carries
with
it
that
state
courts
are
not
to
act
on
it
and
the
same
state
court
absent
little
norris-laguardia
act
have
no
such
proscription,
we
wind
up
again
under
this
opted
for
policy
coming
out
at
the
extreme
once
again.
and
finally,
in
connection
with
somebody
that
appears
to
me
to
be
similar,
our
stories
is
the
question
of
section
10
(a)
in
its
expressed
congressional
attempt
of
ceding
the
board
jurisdiction
but
it's
got
to
be
consistent
with
the
act.
there's
got
to
be
an
agreement
consistent
with
it
and
the
law
must
be
equally
applied.
and
under
the
solicitor
general's
contention,
we
totally
violate
each
and
every
one
of
those
terms
and
provisions.
i
think
there
is
of
course
an
even
more
significant
point.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
the
windward
opinion
cited
this
courts
lorensen
--
lorensen
case.
the
footnote
there
of
brush
appeals
and
that
brush
appeals
are
the
same
in
those
instances
who
wanted
this
court
to
legislate
the
fact.
i
say
this
is
equally
of
nothing
more
a
brush
attack
but
the
solicitor
general
would
do
that
but
there's
something
more
significant
which
was
not
present
in
either
lorensen
or
in
(inaudible).
since
this
case,
there
has
been
proposed
in
both
houses,
legislation
which
seeks
to
preserve
domestic
employment
opportunities
for
american
seamen
and
that's
what
they
we're
engaged
here.
it's
known
as
the
energy
transportation
security
act
of
1974,
extensive
hearings
were
held.
solicitor's
client
state
department
came
before
both
houses
and
may
each
and
everyone
of
the
argument
he's
making
subjectively
in
his
brief.
national
concern,
concerns
for
the
economy,
international
relations,
exacerbation,
and
the
economy
was
not
successful.
for
whatever
reason,
whether
they
disagree
or
found
no
basis
or
made
the
adjustment,
congress
has
moot
and
congress
has
passed
out
bill
in
the
following
manner.
the
bill
was
passed
over
one
merely
in
a
house,
rejecting
the
state
department's
proposals,
overwhelmingly
in
the
senate,
the
conferees
of
both
houses
have
met,
the
reports
of
the
conferees
has
been
acted
upon
by
the
house
and
accept
overwhelmingly.
the
senate's
report
will
be
acted
upon
by
just
recently
over
the
recess.
but
equally
significant
is
that
the
solicitor
general
recognized.
now,
the
prop
before
and
where
to
go
with
this
sort
of
argument
is
not
to
drag
people
with
this
court.
mr.
howard
schulman
the
energy
transportation
security?
mr.
howard
schulman
and
we
have
it
in
our
brief,
cited
in
another
brief.
mr.
howard
schulman
well,
what
the
law
says
is
that
import
of
american
oil,
of
petroleum
products
in
this
country,
it's
got
to
be
carried
30%
of
the
30%
in
american
flagships
as
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
one
of
the
purposes
as
expressed
by
senate
alone.
the
law
in
colloquy
with
the
assistant
secretary
of
commerce
was
to
make
sure
that
there's
a
domestic
employment
opportunities
for
american
seamen.
mr.
howard
schulman
imports
of
petroleum
products.
mr.
howard
schulman
petroleum,
carriage
of
petroleum
products
into
our
country.
mr.
howard
schulman
correct,
up
to
30%.
mr.
howard
schulman
no
by
1977
as
a
graduated
scale.
by
1977,
it's
got
to
be
full
30%.
mr.
howard
schulman
certain
rights
are
reserved
in
light
of
emergency
obviously
to
suspend
upon
action
of
the
executive
legislative
fringe.
mr.
howard
schulman
doesn't
have
any
bearing
on
it.
no,
other
than
it
demonstrates
to
me
that
each
and
every
one
of
the
arguments
the
solicitor
has
used
here,
and
its
briefs
submitted
to
this
court.
he
has
used
before
congress
and
we
so
demonstrate
it
in
our
supplemental
brief
and
we
cite
where
it's
used.
and
then
each
and
every
instance,
the
court
as
to
the
congress
has
just
rejected.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
and
that's
what
i
believe
however.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
i
think
the
solicitor
is
asking
you
for
--
of
course
when
you
read
his
brief,
he
talks
about
their
concerns.
he
is
saying
this
should
be
so
because
of
the
concern
for
prior
relations.
this
should
be
so
because
of
concern
for
national
affairs.
this
should
be
so
because
the
concern
for
the
economy.
each
and
every
instance
that
to
me
it
presents
an
issue
purely
legislative
and
equally
significant
made
by
secretary,
the
secretary
of
the
state
as
well
as
other
agencies
administered
government
taking
the
branch
to
congress
and
not
accept
it,
and
that
to
me
is
a
brush
appeal.
maybe
my
subjective
pleading
as
in
advert
to
get
us
a
little
color
but
what
appear
to
me
and
if
you've
gone
to
one
forum
body
and
you
rejected
there,
it
doesn't
suit
well
to
look
for
another
suitor
or
to
go
to
another
forum,
you
go
shopping,
and
i
submit
and
so
submit
state,
i
believe
this
was
the
solicitor
is
doing
here,
doing
just
that.
i
see
i
have
just
a
few
moments
and
i
just
like
to
direct
a
few
remarks
to
first
amendment
argument,
the
free
speech
argument.
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
talking
about
the
conduct
involved
here.
the
conduct
involved
was
the
same
conduct
we
wind,
of
the
same
conduct
of
national
policy
action
of
this
which
is
all
over
the
country.
new
picket
sending
out
signs,
asking
for
help
and
assistance
protected
jobs.
alabama
supreme
court
says
in
approaching
that
issue
that
first
of
all,
it
has
the
right
not
withstanding
i
submit,
first
before
to
the
amendment
to
seize
and
issue
a
notice
restricting
all
picketing
pending
that's
looking
in
to
the
purpose
of
objects
where
the
effects
may
affect
the
national
economy
of
the
state.
and
as
i
read
this,
is
the
prohibited
conduct
which
this
court
express,
in
thornhil
up
to
kiff
of
a
blanket
provision
saying
when
that
affects
the
national
economy
of
our
local
area
that
our
state
policy
is
that
all
injunct
or
picketing
is
to
be
restrained,
we
know
of
no
such
authority
to
that
effect.
i
do
not
think
that
a
state
possesses
that
right
on
the
mere
expression
that
it
may
affect
local
economy
to
stop
all
free
speech.
that
has
not
given,
that
is
not
bought,
that
is
not
hankey

the
other
cases
authorizing
labor
disputes,
state
valid

and
the
demand
open
to
them
for

and
i
think
there's
more
in
this
case
if
we
find
argument
in
the
brief.
in
addition
to
that,
alabama
says,
wrongful
interference
and
nothing
more,
just
the
two
words,
wrongful
interference,
the
person's
right
to
do
business
with
the
matter
of
state
policy
may
enjoin
picketing.
i
submit
or
patent
in
the
economy,
i
submit,
that
runs
directly
about
this
court's
decision
in
kiff
where
the
man
was
engaged
in
business
at
his
house.
that
goes
the
problem
i
believe.
alabama
may
not
so
broadly
restrain,
have
not
established
the
confines,
the
valid
state
for
the
policy
assuming
the
domain
is
open
to
them,
assuming
there's
no
preemption.
and
finally,
we
have
involved
here
what
i
think
in
the
final
analysis
is
alabama
making
a
finding
by
its
supreme
court
when
the
district
court
and
the
local
court
made
no
findings
effect
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
answering
objection
to
that
say,
well,
they
must
have
made
certain
findings
otherwise
they
wouldn't
have
issued
the
injunction.
i
guess
under
those
circumstances,
we
don't
need
appellate
courts
but
not
withstanding
that.
the
issue
which
we
have
presented
there
and
we
enumerated
quite
bit
in
our
brief
is
that
they've
hit
upon
a
personal
hope
and
desire
of
a
very
low
official
who
testified
under
very
scheme
for
cross
examination
my
good
friend
prompt
me
corrected
it,
as
to
his
personal
hopes
and
desires,
what
he
would
personally
like
to
see
and
admittedly
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
campaign
other
than
to
serve
the
picket
lines
and
carry
the
instructions
out.
and
based
upon
that,
the
court
said,
the
purpose
of
this
picketing
may
have
been
to
tie
up
the
whole
harbor
until
congress
brought
some
legislation
to
bring
the
whole
harbor
down.
and
i
say,
under
this
courts
decision
in
grain,
we
need
to
search
the
record
to
find
subsisting
facts,
essential
facts
to
warrant
the
restrictions
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
should
be
made
in
this
case
and
i
think
when
they're
made
in
this
case,
there
is
no
finding
that
the
conduct
of
this
individual,
his
own
personal
hopes
and
expectations
could
be
charged
against
the
conduct
of
this
committee
and
his
thousands
of
american
seamen
was
merely
exercising
a
fundamental
right.
i
reserve
the
few
moments
left
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
a
few
things
your
honor.
i
would
have
thought
at
listening
to
my
friends,
i
wonder
windward
case
not
lost.
well
as
calamities
talk
about
tangled
ports,
well
that's
what
this
court
decided
in
windward,
the
foreign
ship
owner
can
go
into
court
and
enjoin
the
picketing.
i
don't
understand
why
all
this
foreign
vessels
are
not
going
to
call
at
their
ports.
there
isn't
any
basis
at
all
to
their
argument
and
i
think
any
question
about
the
motivations
of
the
people
i
represent
or
the
farmer
involved
as
to
what's
concerned
there,
that
should
be
better
directed
to
congress.
the
elected
director
remarked
that
both
mr.
justice
marshall
or
mr.
justice
white
i
believe
asked
my
friends
relative
to
the
findings
being
made
by
the
state
court.
i'm
reading
now
from
page
28
of
the
appendix.
the
trial
judge
decree
granting
writ
of
temporary
injunction
made
no
finding
of
fact
from
the
evidence
that
is
complete
and
absolute.
but
apparently,
the
trial
judge
found
from
the
evidence
that
there
was
wrongful
interference
by
the
appellants,
with
the
appellees
business
or
other
wise,
he
would
not
have
ordered
the
writ
of
temporary
injunction
to
issue.
and
the
answer
to
that,
there
was
no
finding
and
the
alabama
supreme
court
just
makes
that
indication
on
an
assumption.
mr.
howard
schulman
28
of
the
--
mr.
howard
schulman
of
the
appendix.
mr.
howard
schulman
i'm
sorry.
mr.
howard
schulman
28.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes
and
from
which
it
says
we
--
mr.
howard
schulman
yes.
mr.
howard
schulman
that
that
it
may
have
been
at
the
court
below
may
have
based
upon
that.
mr.
howard
schulman
inequity,
yes.
mr.
howard
schulman
yes,
but
whether
that
meets
the
standards
necessary
of
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment,
i
think
it's
a
different
question.
mr.
howard
schulman
with
respect
to
the
situation
involving
hanna
and
the
windward,
in
both
those
instances,
the
state
court
regulated
otherwise
unregulated
conduct.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
otherwise
unregulated
--
the
otherwise
conduct
involved
here
is
the
secondary
aspect
regulate
above
the
labor
board.
now,
with
respect
to
this
talk
about
the
record
as
to
the
position
of
witnesses
and
an
intend
to
place
this
court's
time
and
discussing
that
other
minute
set
forth
in
the
record,
in
the
position
of
this
mr.
nary
and
whether
there
was
adequate
evidence
upon
which
a
court
could
move
in
and
say
all
these
rights
of
this
tens
of
thousands
of
american
seamen
suddenly
abrogated.
i
think
it's
a
requirement
to
search
their
record
and
determine
that
under
the
grain
case,
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
the
necessary
quantum
to
warrant
such
restriction
as
the
alabama
court
did
here.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
schulman
no,
that
is
not
the
--
it
isn't
because
of
titles,
no,
it's
because
of
the
substantive
nature
of
the
complaint.
in
the
windward
case,
the
unions
were
accused
of
interfering
and
trying
to
change
the
contractual.
as
this
court
said,
they
must
have
hope
or
expected.
they
would
have
given
more
money.
therefore,
it
falls
under
benz
which
holds,
it
involves
the
internal
operation
of
the
vessels.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
the
difference
here
is
that
there's
--
this
is
not
the
issue
of
this
plaint
here
--
plaintiff
here,
is
not
to
regulate
the
conduct
to
foreign
ship
owner.
he
is
saying
picketing
is
stopping
him
from
doing
business.
that's
referring
with
this.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
that's
an
8
(b)
4.
mr.
howard
schulman
and
that's
exclusive
in
labor
board,
mr.
justice
brennan.
thank
you.
