justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
does
that
bill
do
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
distinctly
what
--
how's
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
none
of
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
issue
we
have
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
you
don't
agree
with
the
solicitor
general?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
that
there's
no
preemption
at
all,
not
even
to
the
extent
of
allowing
the
board
to
have
concurrent
jurisdiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
before
or
after
the
boards
could
enjoin
the
picketing
to
protect
the
neutral
employer
which
is
pretty
close
to
the
certain
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
anyway,
you'd
rather
not
have
to
track
salary
and
approve
an
8
(b)
4
case
before
the
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
happy
with
the
state
court
having
exclusive
jurisdiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
45?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
can
you
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
say
28?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
28.

j.
brennan,
jr.
28.
justice
william

--
over
to
page
23
of
it.
the
court
says,
this
necessitates
our
deciding
whether
or
not
there
was
any
evidence
to
support
it
protrusion.
it's
picketing
here
that
is
the
purpose
or
object.
the
wrongful
interference
with
the
appellees
business
and
then
doesn't
the
supreme
court
go
on
examined
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
clue
that
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
based
on
that
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather,
it
would
appear
at
least
mr.
schulman
that
maybe
we
don't
do
this
in
the
federal
courts
when
there
are
some
state
courts
that
i'm
familiar
with
one
which
did
the
same
thing,
equity
cases.
we
didn't
need
findings
of
chance
for
court,
we
examined
the
record
and
made
our
own
determination
based
on
the
--
on
the
record
inequity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
this
is
i
guess?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
maybe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
sit
down
mr.
schulman,
on
your
preemption
point,
i
gather
you
distinguished
windward,
of
course
the
plaintiffs
here
are
not
the
foreign
ships?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
difference
to
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
