mr.
frank
mcright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
quite
frankly
thought
with
this
courts
issuance
of
decision
in
windward
the
petitioner's
preemption
argument
wouldn't
be
urged.
the
picketing
in
windward
was
the
same
as
the
picketing
in
mobile.
it
was
furtherance
the
same
national
program
involving
the
same
unions,
the
same
picket
signs,
having
the
same
effect,
using
the
same
leaflets.
the
same
consequences
in
windward
as
this
court
noted
in
windward
were
noted
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
as
to
the
picketing
in
mobile.
was
either
the
force
are
raised
in
the
internal
standards
of
those
vessels
or
to
block
those
vessels
from
the
use
of
us
ports.
and
of
course
this
court
held
that
in
windward,
under
those
circumstances,
the
picketing
was
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
national
labor
relations
board.
essentially,
the
petitioners
argued
two
distinctions
between
this
case
and
the
houston
picketing
in
windward.
one,
they
have
apparently
abandoned
here
an
oral
argument,
that
is
the
allegation
that
the
vessels
involved
who
are
constructively
american
owned.
so
we
won't
need
to
talk
about
that.
the
other
distinction
is
that
although
the
primary
dispute
here
may
not
be
in
commerce,
there
were
secondary
effects
which
are
in
commerce
and
which
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
of
course,
in
windward,
we
were
talking
about
the
picketing
not
being
in
commerce.
it's
the
same
picketing
here
that
was
involved.
so,
this
courts
determination
that
the
picketing
was
not
in
commerce,
certainly
should
carry
some
weight
beyond
the
allegation
that
the
primary
dispute
was
not
in
commerce,
and
it
was
the
picketing
here
that
was
the
subject
of
our
complaint.
the
allegations
of
the
state
court
complaint
were
against
the
picketing
specifically.
paragraphs
20,
21,
22
of
the
complaint
“complained
of
picketing
and
other
interference
directed
at
the
foreign
flag
vessels
and
of
mobile.”
so
it
was
the
picketing
itself
that
was
a
basis
of
the
mobile
steamship
associations
complaint.
the
fact
that
there
maybe
secondary
aspects
involved
here
has
pretty
well
been
disposed
off.
i
think
this
court
in
hanna
versus
meba
indicated
that
where
the
primary
dispute
in
that
case,
a
dispute
involving
efforts
to
organize
supervisors,
employees
not
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
indeed
foreign
crewmen
not
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
here
where
the
primary
dispute
was
not
in
commerce
as
this
court
held
in
windward,
the
fact
that
a
state
court
injunction
might
in
fact
regulate
some
conduct
arguably
subject
--
arguably
violative
of
section
8
(b)
4,
did
not
prevent
the
states
supreme
court
from
--
state
court's
from
acting.
the
court
indicated
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
concurring
opinion
that
the
issue
was
where
the
congress
had
excluded
state
regulation
of
picketing
outside
the
coverage
of
the
act
when
the
picketing
also
has
secondary
aspects
arguably
within
the
rates
of
section
8
(b)
4
and
the
court
said
no.
that
in
that
area,
federal
occupation
of
the
matter
is
at
the
minimum
and
state
power
is
at
peak.
mr.
frank
mcright
yes.
i
am
saying
that
the
complaint
that
the
stevedores
made
was
against
the
picketing.
mr.
frank
mcright
your
honor
i
think
we
might
allege
it
but
i'm
very
much
afraid
that
under
the
--
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
mcright
i
don't
think
under
those
circumstances
that
the
board
under
windward
could
get
its
hands
on
the
real
problem
though.
and
the
real
problem
here
being
the
picketing,
the
coerce
at
picketing
directed
at
the
foreign
flag
vessels.
mr.
frank
mcright
well,
i
think
the
situation
there
would
be
--
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
mcright
i
think
that's
the
substance
of
what
he
is
saying.
i'm
saying
that
the
real
problem
here
with
the
picketing
was
--
and
we'll
get
into
that
in
a
few
minutes
on
the
constitutional
question.
the
real
problem
with
the
picketing
here
was
that
it
interfered
with
the
operation,
the
alabama
state
docks
had
shut
it
down
and
it
virtually
close
the
port
of
mobile
and
could
close
the
ports
to
this
country
to
foreign
shipping.
i
don't
think
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
that
kind
of
objection.
mr.
frank
mcright
not
entirely,
no
sir.
mr.
frank
mcright
not
as
to
the
--
not
as
to
the
complaint
we
made
in
the
state
court,
no
sir.
mr.
frank
mcright
secondary
--
if
we
could
prove
secondary
motive,
perhaps
but
they
couldn't
get
to
the
problem
that
we
complained
of.
mr.
frank
mcright
that's
essentially
the
case.
that's
the
way
with
most
trained
employers.
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir.
now,
the
--
as
to
the
constitutional
issue,
and
i
want
to
hurry
because
we've
agreed
to
divide
argument,
we've
got
another
respondent,
the
farmer
that
was
injured
by
the
picketing
too.
but
as
to
the
constitutional
issue,
i
think
the
evidence
is
pretty
clear
that
the
picketing
was
not
really
published
to
but
it
--
but
really
intended,
designed
and
conducted
to
signal,
other
organized
workers
not
to
go
to
work.
the
picketing
commenced
within
a
very
few
minutes
after
the
ila,
in
fact
was
ordered
to
return
to
work
by
the
federal
court.
it
was
timed
and
located
to
be
in
the
path
of
the
ila.
the
ila
is
an
affiliated
union
with
the
six
maritime
unions
of
the
petitioners
here.
indeed,
the
masters
made
some
pallets,
one
of
the
petitioning
unions
is
a
part
of
the
ila,
the
division
of
the
ila.
they
knew,
they
said
they
had
more
than
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
ila
would
not
cross
the
picket
lines.
when
they
--
the
unions
witness
was
asked
why
he
didn't
time
and
locate
the
picketing
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
work
cause
of
the
ila,
the
comment
was
made
by
counsel
that
that
kind
of
question
shows
an
incredible
ignorance
of
what
a
picket
line
is
supposed
to
do,
what
that
particular
picket
line
was
supposed
to
do.
and
it
was
admitted
in
the
brief
that
the
petitioner's
picket
line
meant
essentially
do
not
work,
do
not
work
in
these
vessels
rather
union
members
and
the
objective
was
to
in
effect
was
to
shot
the
state
docks
down
to
foreign
shipping.
it
came
out
a
very
critical
time
because
at
that
particular
time,
the
sore
being
promised
--
mr.
frank
mcright
well,
i
think
hankey
sir.
i
think
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
indicated
that
picketing
by
organized
labor
in
the
plot
of
other
organized
labor
is
more
than
free
speech.
in
the
hughes
case,
the
court
said,
picketing
by
the
organized
group
is
more
than
free
speech.
the
presence
of
such
a
picket
line
may
induce
action.
in
gibonni,
it
is
clear
that
the
unions
were
doing
more
than
exercising
a
right
of
free
speech.
and
i
would
like,
because
there
was
reference
in
the
reply
brief
to
the
logan
valley
case,
indeed
the
briefs
in
logan
valley
where
the
petitioners
indicated
that
there
was
signal
picketing
involved
there
to
state
for
the
court
that
in
logan
valley,
we
only
had
one
issue.
the
court
only
was
faced
with
one
issue
and
that
was
a
pure
property
question.
there
was
an
appeal
to
union
members
but
union
members
as
consumers
are
not
union
members
as
employees
and
i
think
that's
a
significant
difference.
i
think
union
members
as
employees
or
any
members
of
any
organized
group
tend
to
act
by
virtue
of
petitions,
tend
to
act
by
virtue
of
to
boost
and
solidarity
that
aren't
involved
in
a
situation
where
the
appeal
is
purely
to
consumers
asking
for
by
virtue
of
the
persuasive
nature
of
the
message
individual
action.
but
in
--
mr.
frank
mcright
in
the
state
trial
court,
no
sir.
there
was
a
discussion
of
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
and
its
conduct
in
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir
and
i
think
that
finding
is
contained
in
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
frank
mcright
well,
i
think
--
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir.
i
think
there
is
enough
--
enough
for
the
facts
shown
that
the
-
that
the
picketing
was
located
in
the
path
of
ila
labor
that
mr.
nary
wanted
to
shutdown
--
mr.
frank
mcright
well,
on
page
14
a
of
the
appendix,
the
dispute
was
either
one
between
the
union
and
the
foreign
ship
owners
to
force
a
rise
in
the
internal
standards
of
those
vessels
or
one
where
the
intent
was
to
block
the
use
of
those
ships
to
force
congressional
action.
the
--
on
page
21,
the
appellants
contend
that
the
only
purpose
was
to
carry
out
publicity
picketing
to
inform
the
public
of
the
flight
of
american
seamen.
the
appellee
contends
picketing
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
and
encouraging
the
appellees
employees
to
seize
loading.
mr.
frank
mcright
sir?
mr.
frank
mcright
i'm
sorry
to
use
the
time.
on
page
25
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
frank
mcright
it's
25
your
honor.
mr.
frank
mcright
no
sir.
mr.
frank
mcright
well,
i'll
say
this
your
honor.
in
alabama,
the
practice
in
custom
has
not
been
for
the
state
court
to
--
as
a
matter
of
custom
and/or
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
are
low,
granted
that
in
the
federal
system,
this
is
required
under
rule
54
or
51,
i'm
not
sure
which.
mr.
frank
mcright
your
honor
i
think
there's
ample
findings
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
opinion
to
sustain
the
position
that
you
heard.
mr.
frank
mcright
on
page
25
and
i
think
there
that
they
take
that
the
court
takes
the
position
that
under
either
alternative,
if
the
purpose
was
to
block
the
use
of
port
mobile
to
foreign
vessels
or
to
force
foreign
ship
owners
to
increase
their
wages,
either
of
those
would
be
violative
of
alabama
public
faults.
i
don't
really
--
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir
and
they
certainly
would
because
the
court
--
the
case
was
tried
to
a
judge
and
in
that
event,
evidences
presented
to
the
court
in
the
appeals
instance
is
--
can
be
read
just
as
well
as
heard
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
frank
mcright
i
don't
think
it's
that
much
there
your
honor
and
i
do
think
that
it's
largely
uncontroverted.
certainly,
as
to
the
signal
effect
to
the
picketing
and
certainly
as
to
its
ultimate
purpose,
i
don't
think
there's
any
real
controversy
of
fact
over
those
two
points.
and
i
think
that
with
that
in
mind
that
this
court
applying
hankey
where
you
have
a
situation
that
union
members
were
appealing
to
union
deliver,
not
make
deliveries
in
order
to
force
recognition
of
a
union
by
self-employed
persons
that
this
court
indicated
that
balance
has
to
be
struck
and
that
balance
comes
to
this
court
bearing
a
way
title
of
respect.
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
petitioner's
reference
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
--
to
the
briefs
field
in
the
logan
valley
case,
a
very
helpful
and
in
particular
would
ask
the
court
if
it
would
to
take
a
look
at
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
aflci
on
that
case
who
appeared
as
amicus
here.
i
think
they
recognize
the
point
that
we
are
making
that
is
that
signal
picketing,
because
it's
by
nature
so
very
coercive
can
be
limit
even
though
the
act
sought
is
lawful
of
itself
uncoercive
solicitation
of
that
particular
act
would
be
constitutionally
protected
free
speech.
that
statement
and
other
statements
begin
on
page
16
of
the
brief
and
our
very
enlightening
on
the
different
kinds
of
picketing
and
how
my
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
view
picketing
generally
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
context.
i
think
the
real
question
here,
certainly
the
alabama
policies,
the
alabama
state
docks
is
a
public
facility.
certainly
the
picketing
interfered
with
the
operation
of
that
public
facility.
their
decisions
to
this
court
that
indicate
that
intentional
interference
with
the
operation
of
public
facilities
maybe
constitutionally
limited
interference
with
court
systems,
the
jail
systems
were
the
subject
to
the
cases
of
cuts
and
the
appellee
decisions.
beyond
that,
these
unions
by
their
announced
purpose
could
and
would
close
the
ports
of
this
country
including
the
port
of
mobile,
the
only
seaport
in
alabama
to
foreign
shipping.
foreign
shipping
comprises
by
tonnage,
i
think
something
like
95%
of
the
commerce,
foreign
commerce
to
country,
something
like
70%,
80%
of
the
vessels
that
call
the
port
of
mobile
fly
the
foreign
flag.
i
think
any
society
acting
in
itself
interest
can
establish
a
policy.
indeed
congress
could
establish
a
policy
if
he
so
wish.
alabama
through
its
judiciary
has
recognized
that
policy
that
the
interference
on
such
a
large
scale
with
essential
economy
of
a
society
can
be
regulated.
and
the
question
presented
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
use
signal
picketing
to
close
the
port
of
mobile,
indeed,
the
ports
of
this
country
to
foreign
flagship.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
frank
mcright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
quite
frankly
thought
with
this
courts
issuance
of
decision
in
windward
the
petitioner's
preemption
argument
wouldn't
be
urged.
the
picketing
in
windward
was
the
same
as
the
picketing
in
mobile.
it
was
furtherance
the
same
national
program
involving
the
same
unions,
the
same
picket
signs,
having
the
same
effect,
using
the
same
leaflets.
the
same
consequences
in
windward
as
this
court
noted
in
windward
were
noted
by
the
alabama
supreme
court
as
to
the
picketing
in
mobile.
was
either
the
force
are
raised
in
the
internal
standards
of
those
vessels
or
to
block
those
vessels
from
the
use
of
us
ports.
and
of
course
this
court
held
that
in
windward,
under
those
circumstances,
the
picketing
was
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
national
labor
relations
board.
essentially,
the
petitioners
argued
two
distinctions
between
this
case
and
the
houston
picketing
in
windward.
one,
they
have
apparently
abandoned
here
an
oral
argument,
that
is
the
allegation
that
the
vessels
involved
who
are
constructively
american
owned.
so
we
won't
need
to
talk
about
that.
the
other
distinction
is
that
although
the
primary
dispute
here
may
not
be
in
commerce,
there
were
secondary
effects
which
are
in
commerce
and
which
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
of
course,
in
windward,
we
were
talking
about
the
picketing
not
being
in
commerce.
it's
the
same
picketing
here
that
was
involved.
so,
this
courts
determination
that
the
picketing
was
not
in
commerce,
certainly
should
carry
some
weight
beyond
the
allegation
that
the
primary
dispute
was
not
in
commerce,
and
it
was
the
picketing
here
that
was
the
subject
of
our
complaint.
the
allegations
of
the
state
court
complaint
were
against
the
picketing
specifically.
paragraphs
20,
21,
22
of
the
complaint
“complained
of
picketing
and
other
interference
directed
at
the
foreign
flag
vessels
and
of
mobile.”
so
it
was
the
picketing
itself
that
was
a
basis
of
the
mobile
steamship
associations
complaint.
the
fact
that
there
maybe
secondary
aspects
involved
here
has
pretty
well
been
disposed
off.
i
think
this
court
in
hanna
versus
meba
indicated
that
where
the
primary
dispute
in
that
case,
a
dispute
involving
efforts
to
organize
supervisors,
employees
not
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
indeed
foreign
crewmen
not
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
here
where
the
primary
dispute
was
not
in
commerce
as
this
court
held
in
windward,
the
fact
that
a
state
court
injunction
might
in
fact
regulate
some
conduct
arguably
subject
--
arguably
violative
of
section
8
(b)
4,
did
not
prevent
the
states
supreme
court
from
--
state
court's
from
acting.
the
court
indicated
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
concurring
opinion
that
the
issue
was
where
the
congress
had
excluded
state
regulation
of
picketing
outside
the
coverage
of
the
act
when
the
picketing
also
has
secondary
aspects
arguably
within
the
rates
of
section
8
(b)
4
and
the
court
said
no.
that
in
that
area,
federal
occupation
of
the
matter
is
at
the
minimum
and
state
power
is
at
peak.
mr.
frank
mcright
yes.
i
am
saying
that
the
complaint
that
the
stevedores
made
was
against
the
picketing.
mr.
frank
mcright
your
honor
i
think
we
might
allege
it
but
i'm
very
much
afraid
that
under
the
--
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
mcright
i
don't
think
under
those
circumstances
that
the
board
under
windward
could
get
its
hands
on
the
real
problem
though.
and
the
real
problem
here
being
the
picketing,
the
coerce
at
picketing
directed
at
the
foreign
flag
vessels.
mr.
frank
mcright
well,
i
think
the
situation
there
would
be
--
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir.
mr.
frank
mcright
i
think
that's
the
substance
of
what
he
is
saying.
i'm
saying
that
the
real
problem
here
with
the
picketing
was
--
and
we'll
get
into
that
in
a
few
minutes
on
the
constitutional
question.
the
real
problem
with
the
picketing
here
was
that
it
interfered
with
the
operation,
the
alabama
state
docks
had
shut
it
down
and
it
virtually
close
the
port
of
mobile
and
could
close
the
ports
to
this
country
to
foreign
shipping.
i
don't
think
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
that
kind
of
objection.
mr.
frank
mcright
not
entirely,
no
sir.
mr.
frank
mcright
not
as
to
the
--
not
as
to
the
complaint
we
made
in
the
state
court,
no
sir.
mr.
frank
mcright
secondary
--
if
we
could
prove
secondary
motive,
perhaps
but
they
couldn't
get
to
the
problem
that
we
complained
of.
mr.
frank
mcright
that's
essentially
the
case.
that's
the
way
with
most
trained
employers.
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir.
now,
the
--
as
to
the
constitutional
issue,
and
i
want
to
hurry
because
we've
agreed
to
divide
argument,
we've
got
another
respondent,
the
farmer
that
was
injured
by
the
picketing
too.
but
as
to
the
constitutional
issue,
i
think
the
evidence
is
pretty
clear
that
the
picketing
was
not
really
published
to
but
it
--
but
really
intended,
designed
and
conducted
to
signal,
other
organized
workers
not
to
go
to
work.
the
picketing
commenced
within
a
very
few
minutes
after
the
ila,
in
fact
was
ordered
to
return
to
work
by
the
federal
court.
it
was
timed
and
located
to
be
in
the
path
of
the
ila.
the
ila
is
an
affiliated
union
with
the
six
maritime
unions
of
the
petitioners
here.
indeed,
the
masters
made
some
pallets,
one
of
the
petitioning
unions
is
a
part
of
the
ila,
the
division
of
the
ila.
they
knew,
they
said
they
had
more
than
a
reasonable
expectation
that
the
ila
would
not
cross
the
picket
lines.
when
they
--
the
unions
witness
was
asked
why
he
didn't
time
and
locate
the
picketing
so
as
not
to
interfere
with
the
work
cause
of
the
ila,
the
comment
was
made
by
counsel
that
that
kind
of
question
shows
an
incredible
ignorance
of
what
a
picket
line
is
supposed
to
do,
what
that
particular
picket
line
was
supposed
to
do.
and
it
was
admitted
in
the
brief
that
the
petitioner's
picket
line
meant
essentially
do
not
work,
do
not
work
in
these
vessels
rather
union
members
and
the
objective
was
to
in
effect
was
to
shot
the
state
docks
down
to
foreign
shipping.
it
came
out
a
very
critical
time
because
at
that
particular
time,
the
sore
being
promised
--
mr.
frank
mcright
well,
i
think
hankey
sir.
i
think
this
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
indicated
that
picketing
by
organized
labor
in
the
plot
of
other
organized
labor
is
more
than
free
speech.
in
the
hughes
case,
the
court
said,
picketing
by
the
organized
group
is
more
than
free
speech.
the
presence
of
such
a
picket
line
may
induce
action.
in
gibonni,
it
is
clear
that
the
unions
were
doing
more
than
exercising
a
right
of
free
speech.
and
i
would
like,
because
there
was
reference
in
the
reply
brief
to
the
logan
valley
case,
indeed
the
briefs
in
logan
valley
where
the
petitioners
indicated
that
there
was
signal
picketing
involved
there
to
state
for
the
court
that
in
logan
valley,
we
only
had
one
issue.
the
court
only
was
faced
with
one
issue
and
that
was
a
pure
property
question.
there
was
an
appeal
to
union
members
but
union
members
as
consumers
are
not
union
members
as
employees
and
i
think
that's
a
significant
difference.
i
think
union
members
as
employees
or
any
members
of
any
organized
group
tend
to
act
by
virtue
of
petitions,
tend
to
act
by
virtue
of
to
boost
and
solidarity
that
aren't
involved
in
a
situation
where
the
appeal
is
purely
to
consumers
asking
for
by
virtue
of
the
persuasive
nature
of
the
message
individual
action.
but
in
--
mr.
frank
mcright
in
the
state
trial
court,
no
sir.
there
was
a
discussion
of
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
and
its
conduct
in
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir
and
i
think
that
finding
is
contained
in
the
alabama
supreme
court.
mr.
frank
mcright
well,
i
think
--
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir.
i
think
there
is
enough
--
enough
for
the
facts
shown
that
the
-
that
the
picketing
was
located
in
the
path
of
ila
labor
that
mr.
nary
wanted
to
shutdown
--
mr.
frank
mcright
well,
on
page
14
a
of
the
appendix,
the
dispute
was
either
one
between
the
union
and
the
foreign
ship
owners
to
force
a
rise
in
the
internal
standards
of
those
vessels
or
one
where
the
intent
was
to
block
the
use
of
those
ships
to
force
congressional
action.
the
--
on
page
21,
the
appellants
contend
that
the
only
purpose
was
to
carry
out
publicity
picketing
to
inform
the
public
of
the
flight
of
american
seamen.
the
appellee
contends
picketing
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
and
encouraging
the
appellees
employees
to
seize
loading.
mr.
frank
mcright
sir?
mr.
frank
mcright
i'm
sorry
to
use
the
time.
on
page
25
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
frank
mcright
it's
25
your
honor.
mr.
frank
mcright
no
sir.
mr.
frank
mcright
well,
i'll
say
this
your
honor.
in
alabama,
the
practice
in
custom
has
not
been
for
the
state
court
to
--
as
a
matter
of
custom
and/or
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
are
low,
granted
that
in
the
federal
system,
this
is
required
under
rule
54
or
51,
i'm
not
sure
which.
mr.
frank
mcright
your
honor
i
think
there's
ample
findings
in
the
alabama
supreme
court
opinion
to
sustain
the
position
that
you
heard.
mr.
frank
mcright
on
page
25
and
i
think
there
that
they
take
that
the
court
takes
the
position
that
under
either
alternative,
if
the
purpose
was
to
block
the
use
of
port
mobile
to
foreign
vessels
or
to
force
foreign
ship
owners
to
increase
their
wages,
either
of
those
would
be
violative
of
alabama
public
faults.
i
don't
really
--
mr.
frank
mcright
yes
sir
and
they
certainly
would
because
the
court
--
the
case
was
tried
to
a
judge
and
in
that
event,
evidences
presented
to
the
court
in
the
appeals
instance
is
--
can
be
read
just
as
well
as
heard
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
frank
mcright
i
don't
think
it's
that
much
there
your
honor
and
i
do
think
that
it's
largely
uncontroverted.
certainly,
as
to
the
signal
effect
to
the
picketing
and
certainly
as
to
its
ultimate
purpose,
i
don't
think
there's
any
real
controversy
of
fact
over
those
two
points.
and
i
think
that
with
that
in
mind
that
this
court
applying
hankey
where
you
have
a
situation
that
union
members
were
appealing
to
union
deliver,
not
make
deliveries
in
order
to
force
recognition
of
a
union
by
self-employed
persons
that
this
court
indicated
that
balance
has
to
be
struck
and
that
balance
comes
to
this
court
bearing
a
way
title
of
respect.
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
petitioner's
reference
to
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
--
to
the
briefs
field
in
the
logan
valley
case,
a
very
helpful
and
in
particular
would
ask
the
court
if
it
would
to
take
a
look
at
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
aflci
on
that
case
who
appeared
as
amicus
here.
i
think
they
recognize
the
point
that
we
are
making
that
is
that
signal
picketing,
because
it's
by
nature
so
very
coercive
can
be
limit
even
though
the
act
sought
is
lawful
of
itself
uncoercive
solicitation
of
that
particular
act
would
be
constitutionally
protected
free
speech.
that
statement
and
other
statements
begin
on
page
16
of
the
brief
and
our
very
enlightening
on
the
different
kinds
of
picketing
and
how
my
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
view
picketing
generally
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
context.
i
think
the
real
question
here,
certainly
the
alabama
policies,
the
alabama
state
docks
is
a
public
facility.
certainly
the
picketing
interfered
with
the
operation
of
that
public
facility.
their
decisions
to
this
court
that
indicate
that
intentional
interference
with
the
operation
of
public
facilities
maybe
constitutionally
limited
interference
with
court
systems,
the
jail
systems
were
the
subject
to
the
cases
of
cuts
and
the
appellee
decisions.
beyond
that,
these
unions
by
their
announced
purpose
could
and
would
close
the
ports
of
this
country
including
the
port
of
mobile,
the
only
seaport
in
alabama
to
foreign
shipping.
foreign
shipping
comprises
by
tonnage,
i
think
something
like
95%
of
the
commerce,
foreign
commerce
to
country,
something
like
70%,
80%
of
the
vessels
that
call
the
port
of
mobile
fly
the
foreign
flag.
i
think
any
society
acting
in
itself
interest
can
establish
a
policy.
indeed
congress
could
establish
a
policy
if
he
so
wish.
alabama
through
its
judiciary
has
recognized
that
policy
that
the
interference
on
such
a
large
scale
with
essential
economy
of
a
society
can
be
regulated.
and
the
question
presented
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
use
signal
picketing
to
close
the
port
of
mobile,
indeed,
the
ports
of
this
country
to
foreign
flagship.
thank
you
your
honor.
