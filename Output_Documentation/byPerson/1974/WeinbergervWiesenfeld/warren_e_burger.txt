the
congress
there
elected
to
ignore
the
difference
in
longevity
of
women
over
men?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
point
is,
they
ignored
the
fact
that
women
as
category
live
longer
than
men?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
within
their
legislative
discussion,
i
supposed
you
would
say
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
can
ignore
it
or
they
act
on
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
american

what
is
the

for
benefits
with
respect
to
children,
persons
under
age
18
as
distinguished
from
having
a
line
at
21
or
24
or
some
other
age?

but
you

e.
burger
while
at
14,
16,
and
18
year
old
people,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
there
any
possibility
that
the
reasoning
for
his
claim
depends
somewhat
on
this
age
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
justification?
if
the
justification
is
not
warranted
would
that
enter
into
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
we're
not
confronted
with
that
each
problem
unless
a
19
year
old
brings
at
equal
protection
benefit
sometime?
chief
justice
warren

thank
you,
mrs.

any
further
mr.
