steven
wiesenfeld's
case
concerns
the
entitlement
of
a
female
wage
earner,
a
female
wage
earners
family
to
social
insurance
of
the
same
quality
as
that
accorded
to
the
family
of
a
male
wage
earner.
four
prime
facts
of
the
wiesenfeld
family's
life
situation
bears
special
emphasis.
paula
wiesenfeld,
the
diseased
insured
worker,
was
gainfully
employed
at
all
times
during
the
seven
years
immediately
preceding
her
death.
throughout
this
period,
maximum
contributions
were
deducted
from
her
salary
and
paid
to
social
security.
during
paula's
marriage
to
steven
wiesenfeld,
both
were
employed.
neither
was
attending
school
and
paula
was
the
family's
principal
income
earner.
in
1972,
paula
died
giving
birth
to
her
son
jason
paul,
leaving
the
child's
father
steven
wiesenfeld
with
the
sole
responsibility
for
the
care
of
jason
paul.
for
the
eight
months,
immediately
following
his
wife's
death
and
for
all
but
the
seventh
month
period
thereafter,
steven
wiesenfeld
did
not
engage
in
substantial
gainful
employment.
instead,
he
devoted
himself
to
the
care
of
the
infant
jason
paul.
at
issue
is
the
constitutionality
of
the
gender
line
drawn
by
42
u.s.c.
402
(g),
the
child
in
care
provision
of
the
social
security
act.
however,
it's
established
this
child
and
care
insurance
in
1939,
as
part
of
that
year's
conversion
of
social
security
from
a
system
that
insured
only
the
worker
to
a
system
that
provided
a
family
basis
of
coverage.
the
specific
purpose
of
402
(g)
was
to
protect
families
of
deceased
insured
workers,
by
supplementing
the
child's
benefit
provided
in
42
u.s.c.
402
(d)
with
the
deceased
insured
worker
as
male.
the
family
is
afforded
the
full
measure
of
protection,
a
child's
benefit
under
402
(d),
and
a
child
in
care
benefit
under
402
(g).
whether
deceased
worker
is
female,
family
protection
is
subject
to
a
50%
discount.
a
child
in
care
benefit
for
survivors
of
a
female
insured
worker
is
absolutely
excluded
even
though
as
here
the
deceased
mother
was
the
family's
principle
bread
winner.
this
absolutely
exclusion,
based
on
gender
per
se,
operates
to
the
disadvantage
of
female
workers,
their
surviving
spouses
and
their
children.
it
denies
the
female
worker
social
insurance
family
coverage
of
the
same
quality
as
the
coverage
available
under
the
account
of
a
make
worker.
it
denies
the
surviving
spouse
of
the
female
worker.
the
opportunity
to
care
personally
for
his
child
and
opportunity
afforded
the
surviving
spouse
of
a
male
worker
and
it
denies
the
motherless
child
an
opportunity
for
parental
care,
afforded
the
fatherless
child.
it
is
appellee's
position
that
this
three-fold
discrimination
violates
the
constitutional
rights
of
paula,
steven,
and
jason
paul
wiesenfeld
to
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
guaranteed
to
them
with
respect
to
federal
legislation
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
care
with
which
the
judiciary
should
assess
gender
lines
drawn
by
legislation
is
currently
a
matter
of
widespread
uncertainty.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
recently
observed
in
while
waldie
v.
schlesinger,
decided
november
20,
1974,
precedent
is
still
evolving
and
existing
decisions
of
this
court
are
variously
interpreted
by
the
lower
courts.
appellant
had
urged
in
his
brief,
that
it
would
be
sufficient
if
any
rationality
can
be
conceived
for
the
overt
sex
discrimination
operating
against
the
wiesenfeld
family.
but
this
court
acknowledged
in
reed
v.
reed,
404
us
that
the
legislative
objective
there
in
question,
producing
probate
court
work
loads
did
not
lack
legitimacy.
yet,
in
light
of
the
differential,
based
on
gender
per
se
the
court
required
a
more
substantial
relationship
between
legislative
ends
and
means
so
that
men
and
women
similarly
circumstanced
would
be
treated
alike.
again,
in
the
court's
eight
to
one
judgment
in
frontiero
v.
richardson,
411
us
requiring
the
same
fringe
benefits
for
married
men
and
women
in
the
military,
the
court
evidenced
a
concern
to
analyze
gender
classifications
with
a
view
to
the
modern
world
and
to
be
weary
of
gross,
archaic,
overbroad
generalizations.
as
in
the
case
at
bar,
in
frontiero,
the
underlying
assumption
was
wives
are
typically
dependent,
husbands
are
not.
hence,
the
statutory
scheme
in
this
case,
as
this
scheme
in
frontiero,
favors
one
type
of
family
unit
over
another
and
in
both
cases,
the
basis
for
the
distinction
is
that
in
the
favored
unit
the
husband‘s
employment
attracts
the
benefit
in
question.
where
the
bread
winner
is
male,
the
family
gets
more,
and
where
the
bread
winner
is
female,
the
family
gets
less.
kahn
v.
shevin,
416
us
and
schlesinger
v.
ballad,
this
court's
most
recent
expression,
are
viewed
by
some
as
reestablishing
a
slack
or
a
cursory
review
standard,
at
least
when
the
defender
of
the
discrimination
packages
his
argument
with
the
protective
or
remedial
libel.
kahn
approved
florida's
$15.00
real
property
tax
saving
for
widows.
the
decision
reflects
this
court's
consistent
difference
to
state
policy
in
areas
of
local
concern
such
as
state
tax
systems,
domestic
relations,
zoning,
disposition
of
property
within
the
state's
boarders.
by
contrast
national
workers
insurance
and
no
issue
of
local
concern,
is
in
question
here.
the
differential
in
schlesinger
v.
ballard,
this
court
appointed
out,
did
not
reflect
archaic,
overbroad
generalizations
of
the
kind
involved
in
frontiero
or
in
the
instance
case.
indeed,
there
might
have
been
a
certain
irony
to
a
ruling
in
lt.
ballard's
favor.
to
this
day,
women
seeking
careers
in
the
uniform
services
are
barred
by
federal
statute
and
regulations
from
enlistment
training
and
promotion
opportunities
open
to
men.
the
courts
majority
thought
it
a
mismatch
for
federal
law
to
mandate
unequal
treatment
of
women
officers,
denial
to
them
of
training
and
promotion
opportunities
open
to
men,
a
denial
not
challenged
by
lt.
ballard,
but
to
ignore
that
anterior
discrimination
for
promotion
and
tenure
purposes.
perhaps
most
significantly,
kahn
and
ballard
are
among
the
very
few
situations
where
a
discriminatory
advantage
accorded
some
women
is
not
readily
perceived
as
a
double-edged
sword,
a
weapon
that
strikes
directly
against
women
who
chose
to
be
wives
and
mothers
and
at
the
same
time
to
participate
as
full
and
equal
individuals
in
a
work
centered
world.
but
there
could
not
be
a
clear
a
case
then
this
one
of
the
double-edged
sword
in
operation
of
differential
treatment
accorded
similarly
situated
persons
based
grossly
and
solely
on
gender.
paula
wiesenfeld,
in
fact
the
principal
wage
earner,
is
treated
as
though
her
use
of
work
were
of
only
secondary
value
to
her
family.
steven
wiesenfeld,
in
fact
the
nurturing
parent,
is
treated
as
though
he
did
not
perform
that
function
and
jason
paul,
a
motherless
infant
with
the
child
--
with
the
father,
able
and
willing
to
provide
care
for
him
personally
is
treated
as
an
infant
not
entitled
to
the
personal
care
of
his
sole
surviving
parent.
the
line
drawn
is
absolute,
not
merely
a
more
onerous
test
for
one
sex
than
the
other
as
in
frontiero
and
stanley
v.
illinois,
405
us.
and
a
shout
out
is
more
extreme
then
it
was
in
reed,
where
a
woman
could
qualify
as
administrator,
if
the
man
who
opposed
her,
were
closely
related
to
the
decedent.
this
case,
more
than
any
other,
yet
heard
by
this
court,
illustrates
the
critical
importance
of
careful
judicial
assessment
of
law
reinforced
sex
role
pigeon-holing
defended
as
a
remedy.
for
any
degree
of
scrutiny
that
is
more
than
cursory.
402
(g)'s
conclusive
presumption,
automatically
and
irrebuttably
ragging
husband
principal
bread
winner
displays
the
pattern,
justice
brennan
identified
in
frontiero.
in
practical
effect,
laws
of
this
quality
help
to
keep
women
not
on
the
pedestal
but
in
a
cage.
they
reinforced
not
remedy,
women's
inferior
position
in
the
labor
force.
appellant
has
pointed
out
that
women
do
not
earn
as
much
as
man
and
urges
that
402
(g)
response
to
this
condition
by
rectifying
past
and
present
economic
discrimination
against
women.
this
attempt
to
wrap
a
remedial
rational
around
a
1939
statute,
originating
in
and
reinforcing
traditional
sex
based
assumptions
should
attract
strong
suspicion.
in
fact,
congress
had
in
view
male
bread
winners,
male
heads
of
household,
and
the
women
and
children
depended
upon
them.
its
attention
to
the
families
of
insured
male
workers,
their
wives,
and
children
is
expressed
in
the
scheme
that
heaps
further
disadvantage
on
the
woman
worker
far
from
rectifying
economic
discrimination
against
women.
the
scheme
conspicuously
discriminates
against
women
workers
by
discounting
the
value
to
their
family
of
their
gainful
employment
and
it
intrudes
on
private
decision
making
in
an
area
in
which
the
law
should
maintain
strict
neutrality
for
when
federal
law
provides
a
family
benefit
base
on
a
husband's
gainful
employment,
but
absolutely
bars
that
benefit
base
on
a
wife's
gainful
employment.
the
impact
is
to
encourage
the
traditional
division
of
labor
between
man
and
woman
to
underscore
twin
assumptions;
first,
that
level
for
paying
including
attendant
benefits
is
the
prerogative
of
men;
and
second,
that
women
but
not
men,
appropriately
reduce
their
contributions
in
the
working
life
to
care
for
children.
on
another
day,
the
pernicious
impact
of
gender
lines,
like
the
one
drawn
by
402
(g),
was
precisely
an
accurately
discerned
by
appellant,
in
common
with
every
government
agency
genuinely
determined
to
breakdown
artificial
barriers
and
hindrances
to
woman's
economic
advancement.
appellant
has
instructed
that
employer's
fringe
benefit
and
pension
schemes
must
not
presume,
as
402
(g)
does,
that
husband
is
head
of
household
or
principal
wage
earner.
it
is
surely
irrational
to
condemn
this
sex
line
as
discriminating
against
women
when
it
appears
in
an
employer's
pension
scheme
while
asserting
that
it
rectifies
such
discrimination,
when
it
appears
in
workers
social
insurance.

was

out
inconsistent
congressional
commands.
guidelines
that
he
issued
pursuant
to
title
ix
of
the
education
amendments
of
1972
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--
forbid
recipients
of
federal
money
from
making
distinctions
of
this
kind.
in
sum,
the
prime
generator
of
discrimination
accounted
by
women
in
the
economic
sector
is
the
pervasive
attitude,
now
lacking
functional
justification
that
pairs
women
with
children,
men
with
work.
this
attitude
is
short
of
and
reinforced
by
laws
of
the
402
(g)
variety,
laws
that
tell
a
woman
how
employment
is
less
valuable
to
and
supportive
of
the
family
then
the
employment
of
a
male
worker.
surely,
paula
wiesenfeld
would
find
unfathomable,
it's
attempt
to
cast
the
compensatory
cloak
over
the
denial
to
her
family
of
benefits
available
to
the
family
of
a
male
insured
nor
does
appellant's
rationalization
for
discrimination
even
attempt
to
explain
why
jason
paul,
child
of
a
fully
insured
deceased
worker
can
have
the
personal
care
of
his
sole
surviving
parent
only
if
the
deceased
wage
earning
parent
was
male.
appellant
has
asserted
that
providing
child
and
care
benefits
under
a
female
worker's
account
would
involve
fiscal
considerations.
the
amount
involved
is
considerably
less
than
was
indicated
some
moments
ago.
he
estimates
the
cost
for
this
particular
benefit
to
be
0.01%
of
taxable
payroll
in
the
appendix
at
16,
and
other
differentials
are
not
now
before
this
court.
at
the
same
time
he
maintains
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
am.
justice
ruth
bader

we
are

about
--

justice
ruth

we
are
talking
about
three,
that's
right.
the
number
of
person
affected
15,000
thousand,
estimated

--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
$20
million,
right
and
that
is
the
only
one
we're
talking
about
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
course,
there
is
someone
in
consistent
argument
made
and
that
is
that
the
bulk
of
widowed
fathers
would
not
qualify
for
child
and
care
benefits
in
any
event
according
to
appellant
because
unlike
stephen
wiesenfeld,
they
would
not
devote
themselves
to
child
care,
but
rather
to
gainful
employment.
budgetary
considerations
--
justice

a
child
has
to
be
a
child
entitled
to
child's
benefit
under
the
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
budgetary
considerations
to
justify
invidious
discrimination
should
fair
no
better
in
this
case
than
such
considerations
faired
in
cases
in
which
relatively
larger
cost
savings
were
involved.
for
example,

supplement.
justice
ruth
bader

i
don't
know
why
the
age
line
was
set,
but
it's
for
all
benefit
purposes
under
the
social
security
act.
i
think
a
distinction
is
made
if
a
child
is
attending
school
after
18,
but
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
you
certainly
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
right.
and
whether
that
congress
has
gone
too
far
in
that
direction
is
not
of
concern
here.
certainly,
it
has
not
gone
too
far
when
it
considers
that
an
infant
such
as
jason
paul
wiesenfeld,
might
benefit
from
the
personal
care
of
a
parent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
reasoning
for
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
presumably,
the
greatest
need
is
for
very
young
children,
preschools
children,
and
in
many
cases,
the
sole
surviving
parent,
male
or
female,
may
not
avail
herself
as
the
statute
now
stands
of
this
benefit
once
the
child
gets
beyond
preschool
age
or
school
age.
remember
that
this
is
not
a
benefit
that
is
paid
automatically
no
matter
what.
there
is
an
income
limitation.
once
you
earn
beyond,
it
was
$2,400.00,
$1.00
a
benefit
is
removed
for
ever
$2.00
earned.
so,
the
parent
who
receives
this
benefit
must
be
performing
that
function,
must
be
performing
the
child
care
function.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
but
18
years
as
the
voting
age
now,
i
think
that
that
is
probably
unlikely,
but
in
any
event,
comparing
the
cost
analysis
here
with
the
new
jersey
welfare
rights
organization
case,
that
case
involved
a
wholly
state
funded
program
for
aid
to
families
of
the
working
poor.
this
court
declared
unconstitutional
limitation
of
benefits
under
that
program
to
families
with
wed
parents.
unlike
new
jersey
welfare
rights
organization,
the
case
at
bar
presents
no
issue
of
federal
difference
arguably
due
to
state
family
law
policy
or
any
other
local
concern.
and
surely,
leeway
for
cost
saving
is
no
broader
in
federal
workers
insurance
than
it
is
in
a
wholly
state
financed
and
operated
welfare
program,
a
program
funded
by
general
state
revenues
rather
than
by
contributions
of
insured
workers
and
their
employers.
budgetary
policy
like
administrative
convenience
simply
cannot
provide
a
fair
and
substantial
basis
for
a
scheme
that
establishes
two
classes
of
insured
workers,
both
subject
to
the
same
contributions
work
rate.
male
workers,
whose
families
receive
bulk
protection
and
female
workers
whose
families
receive
diminished
protection.
finally,
the
appropriate
remedy
is
correctly
specified
in
the
judgment
below.
that
judgment
declares
the
gender
line
at
issue
unconstitutional
because
it
discriminates
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
against
gainfully
employed
women
such
as
paula
wiesenfeld
as
well
as
against
men
and
children
who
have
lost
their
wives
and
mothers.
the
judgment
enjoins
enforcement
of
the
statute
insofar
as
it
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
sex.
extension
of
child
and
care
benefits
under
paula
wiesenfeld's
account
is
unquestionably
the
cause
consistent
with
the
dominant
congressional
purpose
to
insure
the
family
of
deceased
workers
and
the
express
congressional
concern
to
ameliorate
the

unequal

withdrawal

conflict

i
did
want
to
comment
very
briefly
on
the
point
made
with
respect
to
woman
receiving
social
security
benefits
that
exceed
the
amount
of
their
contribution.
the
reason
for
this,
the
prime
reason
of
course,
is
that
women
live
longer
than
men.
most
benefits
are
paid
to
retirement
age
beneficiaries
and
women
happened
to
be
58%
of
the
population
of
persons
over
65
that
increases
in
time
there
about
54.5%
of
the
65-year
olds,
58.5%
of
the
75-year
olds,
and
about
64.5%
of
the
85-year
olds.
but
the
critical
point
here
is
that
payments
to
the
elderly
are
based
on
the
individual's
life
span
not
on
his
or
her
sex.
so,
that
if
a
man
should
live
to
a
100,
he
will
continue
to
receive
benefits
and
he
won't
be
told,
“oh!
too
bad,
you
should
have
died
earlier,
only
women
receives
payments
for
that
length
of
time.”
in
sum,
appellee
respectfully
requests
that
the
judgment
below
be
affirmed,
thereby
establishing
that
under
this
nation's
fundamental
law,
the
woman
workers
national
social
insurance
is
no
less
valuable
to
her
family
than
is
the
social
insurance
of
the
working
man.
