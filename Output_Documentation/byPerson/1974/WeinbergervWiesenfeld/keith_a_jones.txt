mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
claim
of
sex
discrimination
under
the
social
security
act.
section
202
(g)
of
that
act
provides
for
the
payments
of
benefits
to
certain
widowed
mothers.
there
is
no
comparable
provision
under
the
act
for
payment
benefits
to
widowed
fathers.
the
appellee
in
this
case
is
a
widowed
father
who
claims
that
he
is
constitutionally
entitled
to
the
payment
benefits
on
the
same
basis
as
if
he
were
a
widowed
mother.
it
is
the
government's
position
as
i
will
elaborate
that
at
some
length
later
that
this
statute
like
the
property
tax
exemption
in
favor
of
widows
in
kahn
against
shevin,
serves
a
permissible
legislative
objective
of
ameliorating
the
harsh
economic
consequences
of
economic
job
discrimination
against
women
and
that
it
should
be
sustained
on
that
basis.
a
description
of
the
operation
of
the
act
is
essential
to
an
understanding
of
this
case.
the
benefits
payable
under
section
202
(g)
are
paid
out
or
on
account
of
the
social
security
account
of
the
diseased
wage
earner.
the
widowed
mother
receives,
i
think,
a
benefit
equal
to
three
quarters
of
the
primary
insurance
benefit
that
the
diseased
husband
would
have
received
had
he
lived
and
retired,
reduced
$0.50
cents
for
each
dollar
that
the
widow
earns
in
excess
of
$2,400.00
per
year.
the
payments
are
made
to
the
widowed
mother
so
long
as
she
has
a
minor
child
in
her
care
and
remains
unmarried.
similar
benefits
are
provided
under
the
act
to
the
child
of
a
diseased
wage
earner.
a
child
receives
benefits
on
the
basis
of
the
social
security
account
of
his
or
her
diseased
parent,
whether
or
not
the
parent
is
the
father
or
the
mother,
it
makes
no
difference.
but
there
is
no
provision
under
the
act
for
the
payment
of
benefits
to
widowed
fathers
under
the
age
of
60
on
the
basis
of
the
account
of
their
diseased
wives.
the
appellee
in
this
case
is
a
young
unemployed
widower.
after
the
death
of
his
wife
his
child
began
receiving
benefits
based
upon
her
social
security
account.
he
however,
was
not
entitled
to
benefits,
he
i
mean
the
appellee,
was
not
entitled
to
benefits
himself
under
the
act.
in
view
of
this,
he
brought
present
suit
for
the
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
contending
that
he
was
constitutionally
entitled
to
a
distribution
of
benefits
on
the
same
basis
as
if
he
were
a
widow
rather
than
a
widower.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened.
the
court
determined
that
all
sex
based
classifications
are
inherently
suspect
under
this
court's
two
tiered
equal
protection
analysis
that
is
applied
in
recent
years.
the
court
analyzed
the
statute
and
concluded
that
it
did
not
served
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
and
accordingly,
the
court
held
the
statute
on
constitutional
and
ordered
the
payment
of
benefits
to
the
appellee
as
if
he
were
a
widow.
the
court
stayed
its
order
pending
this
appeal
and
the
case
is
now
here
on
the
government's
direct
appeal.
at
the
outset,
i
think
it
can
be
said
that
the
district
court
clearly
erred
in
applying
the
compelling
governmental
interest
standard
of
review.
it
has
become
clear
in
these
court's
decisions
in
kahn
against
shevin
and
last
week
in
schlesinger
against
ballard,
that
sex
based
classifications
are
not
inherently
suspect.
they're
not
subject
to
justification
only
on
the
basis
of
a
so-called
compelling
governmental
interest.
they
are
not
invalid
per
se.
this
is
not
to
suggest
that
the
traditionally
permissive
rational
basis
standard
of
review
is
fully
appropriate
in
all
sex
discrimination
cases.
sex
based
classifications
we
believe
do
merit
close
judicial
scrutiny
and
they've
received
it
by
this
court
in
the
past
in
frontiero
against
richardson
and
reed
against
reed.
this
court
struck
down
the
sex
classifications
that
merely
served
the
purpose
of
administrative
convenience.
plus
the
court
has
applied
a
standard
of
review
which
involves
a
close
scrutiny,
a
scrutiny
which
is
not
so
strict
as
to
be
inevitably
fatal.
the
rule
that
the
court
seems
to
be
applying
is
simply
that
sex
based
classifications
must
rest
upon
some
substantial
reasonable
basis,
or
as
chief
justice
burger
said
in
the
reed
opinion,
“upon
some
ground
of
difference
having
a
fair
and
substantial
relation
to
the
object
of
the
legislation
as
i
will
now
show
the
statute
here
in
question
easily
meets
that
test.”
appellee's
principle
attack
on
the
statute
is
curiously
enough,
not
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
widower
who
has
been
denied
benefits
but
rather
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
female
wager
who
it
is
alleged
is
denied
of
social
security
coverage
for
her
spouse
that
would
have
been
granted
to
a
male
wager
earner.
the
appellee's
argument
proceeds
so
logistically.
first,
the
appellee
analogizes
the
payment
of
social
security
taxes
to
the
purchase
of
private
insurance
coverage
and
the
appellee
contends
that
female
wager
earners
are
not
granted
the
right
to
purchase
the
same
insurance
coverage
that
a
male
wage
earner
purchases
for
his
spouse
under
the
system.
and
appellee's
concludes
that
this
discrepancy
and
treatment
--
this
discrepancy
in
insurance
coverage
is
in
permissible.
we
believe,
there
are
two
fatal
flaws
to
this
chain
of
reasoning.
first,
the
analogy
to
a
private
insurance
scheme
is
itself
fundamentally
erroneous.
as
this
court
noted
in
flemming
against
nestor,
the
social
security
act
comprehends
this
scheme
not
of
private
but
of
social
insurance
under
which,
benefits
are
distributed
and
coverage
provided
in
large
part
on
the
basis
of
probable
need
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
strict
compe
--
rather
than
strictly
on
the
basis
of
the
contributions
that
the
insured
wage
earner
has
paid.
we
even,
accepting
for
the
moment
the
private
insurer
paradigm
on
which
the
appellee
relies,
we
think
it's
nevertheless
clear
that
the
female
wage
earner
is
not
entitled
to
any
additional
insurance
coverage
under
the
act
that
the
female
wage
earner
has
not
been
disadvantaged
in
anyway.
as
we
pointed
out
on
pages
21
and
22
of
our
brief,
female
wage
earners
under
the
social
security
system
pay
in
only
28%
of
all
social
security
taxes
whereas
34%
of
the
benefits
paid
out
in
the
system
are
paid
out
on
the
basis
of
the
social
security
accounts
of
female
wage
earners.
i'm
not
talking
about
the
benefits
that
are
paid
to
women
i'm
talking
about
the
benefits
that
are
paid
out
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
women's
account
as
workers.
now
this
means
that
the
social
security
system
is
already
out
of
actuarial
balance
in
favor
of
female
wage
earner
as
against
the
male
wage
earner.
if
my
rough
estimatical
calculations
are
correct,
right
now,
the
female
wage
earners
receives
a
33%
greater
coverage
under
the
act,
in
terms
of
dollars
than
does
male
wage
earner.
to
grant
the
additional
insurance
coverage
for
which
appellee
contents
here,
would
simply
further
tilt
the
scales
in
favor
of
the
female
wage
earner
as
against
her
male
counter
part.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think,
in
large
part
the
disparity
flows
from
the
fact
that
women
have
longer
life
expectancies
and
that
their
retirement
benefits
are
spread
out
over
a
longer
period
of
time.
they
may
also
be
attributable
in
part
to
the
fact
that
lower
wage
earners
are
entitled
to
somewhat
great
return
under
the
act
than
are
higher
wage
earners
and
women
statistically
are
lower
wage
earners.
like
for
those
two
reasons
and
i'm
not
sure
which
is
more
important,
women
do
received
on
the
basis
of
their
accounts
far
greater
return
than
the
men.
and
our
position
with
respect
to
this
argument,
this
insurance
coverage
argument
by
the
appellee
is
that
to
grant
further
coverage,
to
further
tilt
the
scales
in
favor
of
women,
obviously
would
not
serve
the
purposes
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
it
therefore,
seems
to
us
that
appellee's
insurance
coverage
argument
simply
reduces
to
the
complaint
that
appellee's
individual
wife
as
a
wage
earner,
unlike
the
average
female
wage
earner
has
been
somehow
disadvantaged
that
the
payments
made
on
the
basis
of
her
account
are
in
some
sense
constitutionally
insufficient.
there's
no
merit
to
this
argument
either
legally
or
factually.
as
a
factual
matter,
i
think
that
you
can
deduce
from
the
record
and
that
it
is
clear
that
appellee's
son
has
already
or
will
soon
have
received
greater
benefits
under
the
social
security
act
than
his
wife
ever
paid
into
the
system,
that
there
is
no
ground
for
reviewing
her
account
as
being
somehow
disadvantaged
but
more
fundamental
is
a
legal
matter.
there's
no
basis
for
an
argument
that
a
social
security
contributor
has
a
vested
interest
in
his
or
her
social
security
account.
that
argument
which
obviously
is
not
a
sex
discrimination
argument
was
firmly
rejected
by
this
court
in
flemming
against
nestor
in
language
which,
i
think
is
equally
appropriate
here
and
i
would
like
to
quote,
“the
social
security
system
maybe
accurately
describe
as
a
form
of
social
insurance
whereby
person's
gainfully
employed
and
those
who
employ
them
are
taxed,
to
permit
the
payment
of
benefits
to
the
retired
and
the
disabled
and
their
dependents.”
a
non-contractual
interest
of
an
employee
covered
by
the
act
cannot
be
soundly
analogized
to
that
of
a
holder
of
an
annuity.
his
right
to
benefit
is
bottomed
on
his
contractual
premium
payments.
and
therefore,
i
think
its
clear
that
appellee's
wife
as
a
female
wage
earner,
was
not
disadvantaged
either
in
her
individual
capacity
or
as
a
member
of
a
class
under
the
act,
that
she
was
not
the
subject
--
was
not
the
victim
of
any
cognizable
discrimination
under
act.
for
that
reason,
i
now
turn
to
the
appellee's
alternative
argument
which
is
based
upon
the
contention
that
the
denial
of
benefits
to
a
widower
constitutes
a
denial
of
equal
protection
to
men
as
an
impermissible
discrimination
against
men.
that
argument
it
seems
to
us,
is
foreclosed
by
this
court's
decision
in
kahn
against
shevin.
in
that
case,
this
court
upheld
a
special
florida
property
tax
exemption
that
was
granted
only
to
widows
and
not
to
widowers.
the
objective
of
that
legislation
is
like
that
of
the
statute
here
was
to
ameliorate
some
degree
the
economic
difficulties
that
uniquely
confront
the
lone
woman
who
has
lost
her
husband.
the
court
in
that
opinion
recited
statistics
showing
that
the
average
female
workers
are
in
approximately
40%
of
the
income
of
the
average
male
worker.
and
the
court
noted
that
this
disparity
in
the
economic
capabilities
would
be
exacerbated
in
the
case
of
a
widow
vis-a-vis
a
widower
and
that
the
difference
in
earning
power
between
a
widow
and
widower
was
probably
even
greater
to
that
between
women
and
men
generally.
mr.
justice
douglas
writing
for
the
court
in
that
case
observed
that
while
the
widower
can
usually
continue
in
his
occupation,
in
many
cases,
the
widow
will
suddenly
find
herself
forced
into
a
job
market
with
which
she
is
unfamiliar
and
in
which,
because
of
her
former
economic
dependency,
she
will
have
fewer
skills
to
offer.
and
it's
also
clear
that,
the
discrimination
inherent
in
such
a
statute
between
widows
and
widowers
is
not
impermissible.
as
mr.
justice
brennan,
who
is
dissenting
on
other
grounds
in
that
case,
observed
it's
permissible
to
distinguish
between
widows
and
widowers
because
only
the
former
and
not
the
latter
are
subject
to
discrimination
as
a
class.
and
if
i
may
quote
again
from
the
descending
opinion,
“inclusion
of
needy
widowers
would
not
further
the
state's
overriding
interest
in
remedying
the
economic
effects
of
past
sex
discrimination
of
needy
victims
of
that
discrimination.
no
doubt
some
widowers
are
in
financial
need,
no
one
suggests
that
such
need
results
from
sex
discrimination.”
on
the
basis
of
these
considerations,
the
court
in
this
case,
kahn
against
shevin,
upheld
the
florida
statute
as
resting
upon
some
ground
of
difference
having
a
fair
and
substantial
relation
to
the
object
of
the
legislation.
well,
precisely
the
same
considerations
govern
this
case.
congress
recognized
that
the
probable
need
of
widows
is
greater
than
that
of
widowers
and
then
enacted
section
202
(g)
to
provide
for
that
need.
in
doing
so,
congress
merely
acted
as
it
has
also
done
in
behalf
of
other
persons
such
as
aged
dependent
parents,
who
cannot
be
fairly
expected
to
replace
by
their
own
efforts
in
the
job
market
the
loss
of
support
that
has
been
occasioned
by
the
death
of
a
family
wage
earner.
moreover,
this
provision,
section
202
(g),
does
not
suffer
from
the
vice
of
over
inclusiveness
that
led
two
justices
of
this
court
to
descent
from
the
ruling
in
kahn.
the
amount
of
the
benefits
payable
under
section
202
(g)
is
inversely
correlated
to
the
amount
of
the
widow's
earnings.
so
that
the
women,
who
has
in
fact
successfully
surmounted,
sexual
job
discrimination
is
not
provided
benefits
under
this
act.
similarly,
benefits
are
provided
only
to
the
widow
with
a
minor
child
in
her
care
for
whom
the
economic
consequences
or
job
discrimination
are
heightened
by
the
fact
that
she
must
additionally
provide
competent
child
care
during
the
working
hours.
at
the
same
time,
the
benefits
provided
under
the
statute
are
considerably
more
substantial
than
those
that
were
granted
by
the
property
tax
exemption
in
kahn.
therefore,
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
section
202
(g)
serves
the
permissible
legislative
objective
of
ameliorating
the
economic
consequences
of
the
employment
discrimination
that
widows
with
children
suffer
with
heightened
severity,
and
that
does
both
more
thoroughly,
and
more
carefully
than
the
statute
at
kahn
against
shevin.
i
would
add
at
this
point
only
one
final
point.
at
the
bottom,
the
appellee's
argument
here
is
that
benefits
under
the
social
security
act
must
be
distributed
without
regard
to
sex
equally
to
men
and
women
in
all
cases.
although,
we
realize
that
program
costs
cannot
be
determined
even
a
case
such
as
this,
we
feel
that
it
is
nevertheless
not
without
some
significance
that
the
cost
of
achieving
this
objective
of
paying
out
all
benefits
without
regards
to
sex
would
be
approximately
$350,000,000.00
additional
dollars
per
year.
now
these
statistics
are
set
fort
on
page
15
of
the
appendix.
this
additional
money
would
have
to
come
from
somewhere.
the
social
security
system
is
supposed
to
remain
in
actuarial
balance.
therefore,
to
pay
out
these
additional
benefits
either
social
security
taxes
would
have
to
be
increased
or
some
other
benefit
group
with
the
benefits
payable
to
some
other
group
would
have
to
be
reduced.
in
this
context,
that
we
feel
that
this
court's
statement
in
dandridge
against
williams
is
particularly
appropriate.
that
is
that
it
does
not
sit
to
second
guess
officials
charged
with
difficult
responsibility
of
allocating
scarce
public
welfare
funds
among
the
merit
of
potential
recipients.
now,
to
apply
a
judicial
restrain
of
this
kind
in
a
case
like
this
is
not
however
to
place
the
social
security
system
in
the
iron
grip
of
the
status
quo.
congress
has
recently
considered
sex
based
classifications
under
the
act
and
it
has
amended
the
statute
to
eliminate
one
of
the
major
sex
based
classifications
like
providing
for
the
equalization
of
the
method
of
computing
retirement
benefits
for
men
and
women.
and
it
may
well
act
to
further
reduce
or
ultimately
entirely
eliminate
all
sex
classifications
under
the
act.
but
for
the
present
we
feel
that
it's
clear
that
the
exclusion
of
widowers
under
section
202
(g)
lies
well
within
congress'
constitutional
power
to
allocate
welfare
funds.
for
these
reasons
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that
was
the
only
one
that
i
am
aware
of.
i
don't
think
they
are
anymore
that
remain.
it
--
well,
on
age
exclusively
now
there
are
some
provisions
that
discriminate
between
men
and
women
on
the
basis
of
age.
for
example,
a
widower
over
age
60,
i
mean,
in
some
cases
may
be
entitled
to
benefits
for
as
a
widow
might
be
entitled
to
benefits
at
an
earlier
age.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
without
regard
to
children,
that's
right.
but
i
don't
think
there
are
many
significant
age
qualifications
in
the
act
of
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
this
was
the
difference
that
was
eliminated
in
the
1972
act.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
congress.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
pages
14
through
16
discussed
the
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
we
have
moved
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
three
judges
from
the
court.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
that
that's
on
a
basis
of
a
claim
of
man
who
are
retired
earlier
and
the
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
they're
not
retroactive.
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
they
were
phased
in
over
a
period
of
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes.
i
think
that
it
is
phased
in
over
three
years.
it
does
become
fully
effective
this
year,
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
in
fact
men
were
disfavored
under
the
old
law
and
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
we
don't
think
the
constitutional
places
congress
in
a
straight
jacket
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
distribution
this
wealth
for
benefits.
we
think
either
alternative
is
acceptable
under
the
constitution.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
an
assumption
which,
if
ever
true,
is
no
longer
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
did
have
the
effect
of
providing
women
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
the
government's
argue
was
in
the
motion
to
--
we
maybe
speaking
of
different
cases.
the
one
i
have
in
mind
is
called
kohr
against
weinberger.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
of
course,
congress
doesn't
have
to
locked
into
favoring
disadvantaged
classes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
i
would
like
to
correct
the
typographical
error
on
page
15
of
the
appendix.
in
item
number
two,
it
says
eliminate
the
dependency
requirement
of
section
202
(d)
that
should
be
202
(f).
i
point
out
that
the
appellee
here
is
distinguished
kahn
against
shevin
which
we
rely
or
tried
to
distinguish
it
only
on
two
basis.
one
is
by
relying
upon
the
private
insurance
paradigm
that
female
wage
earners
are
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
insurance
coverage.
i
discussed
that
at
length
in
my
opening
argument.
second
is
that,
kahn
in
some
sense
of
represents
difference
towards
state
taxing
policies
that
appellee
claims
would
not
be
due
to
federal
welfare
policies.
i
don't
understand
it's
now
analytical
matter
by
federal
distribution
of
public
welfare
funds
should
not
be
entitled
to
the
same
difference,
state
taxing
policies.
appellee
also
argues
that,
the
child
here
somehow
has
rights
independent
from
that
of
either
parent.
i
see
no
basis
for
that.
the
child
has
his
own
benefits
under
the
act.
his
only
claim
here
is
that
one
of
his
parents
didn't
get
benefits.
that
claim
is
derivative
from
the
claim
of
the
parent,
cannot
be
analyzed
separately.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
don't
think
that
this
legislative
history
backs
that
up
necessarily
that
legislative
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
legislative
history
shows
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
distribute
benefits
in
accordance
with
the
probable
new
of
beneficiaries
and
was
made
on
the
individual
and
not
on
the
family
basis.
and
it
simply
represents
the
judgment
that
women
who
seek
employment
or
less
likely
to
find
it
than
do
men
and
that
if
they
do
find
it,
they
likely
to
earn
less
than
do
men.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
there
were
no
children
there
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
if
there
are
no
children.
the
problems
of
job
discrimination
at
least
would
not
be
exacerbated
by
the
need
to
provide
child
care
during
the
working
hours.
there
is,
i
think,
the
justifiable
difference
between
treatment
of
widows
generally
and
the
widows
with
minor
children.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
thank
you.
