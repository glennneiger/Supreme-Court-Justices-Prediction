justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
just
one
question.
i
suppose
there
were
no
act
of
state
doctrine
involved
in
the
case
and
they
came
out
as
it
did
with
owing
money,
debts
due
on
either
side.
how
about
dunhill
being
able
to
collect
the
excess
of
what
the
cuba
owes
it
from
the
other
judgments,
from
the
other
assets
available
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
they
were
consolidated
for
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
under
new
york
procedure,
would
it
be
technically
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
dunhill
have
judgment
against
cuba
for
this
--
what
is
it,
80,000
or
whatever
it
is
that
had
that
judgment,
and
it
wanted
to
satisfy.
would
it
be
technically
a
set
off
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
have
to
utilize
other
procedures
available
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
attach
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
less
the
--
your
assets
are
there
before
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
would
it
be
really
any
--
for
purposes
of
--
for
our
purposes,
is
it
really
any
different
than
if
you
found
the
bank
--
that
you
have
this
judgment
and
you
found
the
bank
accounts
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
why
is
it
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
your
position
or
the
--
i'm
not
sure
that
you
need
to
go
so
far.
but
is
it
your
position
that
whenever
foreign
sovereign
comes
into
our
courts,
they
must
come
in
on
our
terms
and
have
that
case
decided
by
traditional
principles
of
law
applicable
to
two
american
litigants?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
you
need
to
illuminate
it
entirely
in
order
to
prevail
on
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
what
about
the
set
off,
face
to
face
set
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
but
you
don't
claim
that
this
present
argument,
you
make
with
no
rob
off
on
any
face
to
face
set
off
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
anything
that
would
like
it
as
a
matter
of
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
could
you
get
them
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
i
understand
that.
but
for
post-intervention
shipments
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
be
paid
for
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
get
the
money
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
what
i
thought
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
litigating
--
what
you're
litigating
here
is
on
funds
to
add
to
the
claimed
accounts
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now
this
is
all
pre-intervention.
justice
byron
r.
white
(uinaudible)
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
out
there,
entitled
any
of
it
back
--
if
you
have
to
pay
anything,
it
comes
up
only
this
frozen
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
wxcuse
me
mr.
rabinowitz,
cuba
got
the
money.
the
fund,
they
got
the
money
or
cuba
got
the
money,
which?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
the
nationalization?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
any
event,
it
didn't
go
to
the
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
it
seems
to
have
been
--
is
that
mean
if
--
are
you
suggesting
if
dunhill
prevails
and
we
reverse
and
dunhill
judgment
is
reinstated,
it's
useless?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they
didn't
file
--
in
the
amount
of
the
judgment
of
the
claim,
whatever
it
was,
will
be
the
commission
within
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
is
that
all
of
it
mr.
rabinowitz?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
all
of
it
that
was
involved
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
dunhill
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
said
earlier,
there
was
no
freeze
order
until
long
after
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
in
the
subject
manner
of
that
petitioner
of
yours
not
yet
acted
on
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
set
off
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
the
other
be
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
is
dismissed,
is
it
proper
that
we
granted
this,
do
you
suggest
we
deny
the
other
two?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
prefer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
prefer?
which
would
you
prefer,
dismissal
is
improbably
granted
or
in
affirmance?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
really
difficult,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
still.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
know,
i
wouldn't
guess
you
wouldn't
wanted
it
affirmed.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
well,
you
--
would
you
prefer
that
to
a
dismissal?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
set
off
as
money
and
the
pocket,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
its
--
its
money
you
don't
have
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
to
get
the
litigation
approval?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case,
which
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
arises
out
of
the
1960
expropriation
of
certain
cuban
cigar
businesses
by
the
republic
cuba,
and
their
operations
thereafter
by
government
representatives
called
interventors.
at
the
time
of
seizure,
petitioner
alfred
dunhill
incorporated
and
other
american
of
cuban
cigars
owed
various
amounts
to
the
cuban
companies
for
cigars
purchased
prior
to
the
seizure.
dunhill
paid
the
sum
it
owed
to
interventors,
but
it
was
later
held
that
this
money
belong
to
the
prior
owner
rather
than
to
interventors.
the
district
court
accordingly
held
dunhill
entitled
to
recover
the
sum
out
of
the
amounts
owing
for
cigars
purchased
after
intervention,
and
to
an
affirmative
judgment
for
any
access,
i.e.,
for
any
amount
not
recovered
by
way
of
set-off.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
except
with
respect
to
the
affirmative
judgment,
which
it
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
the
sum,
mistakenly
paid
by
dunhill,
had
been
the
subject
of
an
act
of
state,
and
that
the
republic
of
cuba
was
therefore
not
open
to
judgment
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
no
act
of
state
was
proved
in
the
courts
below
with
respect
to
the
funds
paid
by
dunhill
for
cigars
purchased
prior
to
the
expropriation.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
reversed.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
a
statement
agreeing
with
parts
one
and
two
of
the
filed
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
he
is
joined
by
justices
brennan,
stewart,
and
blackmun.
