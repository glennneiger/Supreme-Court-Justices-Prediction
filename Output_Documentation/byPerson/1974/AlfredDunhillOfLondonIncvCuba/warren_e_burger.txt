mr.
friedman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
is
it
not
also
an
act
which
takes
place
within
the
jurisdiction
of
that
sovereign
and
then
in
turned
his
asserted
in
our
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
true
in
pons
against
cuba,
do
you
recall
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
p-o-n-s
against
cuba,
was
there
an
official
act
claimed
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
not
important.
i
can
track
that
down.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
--
there
was
--
what
has
our
state
department
had
to
say
about
this
case
in
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
not
usual
that
our
state
department
does
take
a
position
or
at
least
advices
the
courts
that
they
have
no
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wherever
it
is
been
thought,
at
least
in
my
observation
in
cases
of
this
kind
over
18,
20
years,
wherever
the
state
department
has
thought
any
relations
between
the
two
countries
would
be
adversely
affected.
they
didn't
wait
for
anybody
to
ask.
they
affirmatively
told
the
attorney
general
what
was
the
position
of
the
state
department.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
friedman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rabinowitz?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
when
you
spoke
of
dunhill
kindly
paying
that
account,
that
was
before
the
seizure
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
the
seizure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
any
of
it
bracket
the
seizure,
some
before
and
some
after?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
--
well,
i
think
you've
answered
the
question
i
was
about
to
ask.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rabinowitz,
when
you
say
that
why
this
case
is
not
technically
moot
in
the
traditional
sense
that
it
is
at
for
all
practical
purposes,
there's
nothing
left
of
it.
is
that
because
the
claims
against
the
$1,800,000,000.00
will
so
far
exceed
the
fund
that
they
really
get
nothing
or
pennies
issue
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
your
friend
is
overly
optimistic
about
cuba's
voluntarily
paying
any
judgments
which
maybe
entered
against
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
a
doctrine
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
(voice
overlap)
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
cuba
must
have
some
accounts
receivable
due
somewhere
for
sugar
these
days.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
sometimes,
it's
a
document
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
of
the
foreign
office
of
the
sovereign
filed
in
the
litigation,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
free
when
i
put
that
limitation
on
it,
are
you
free
to
offer
a
hypothesis
as
to
why
the
government
of
cuba
as
not
made
any
formal
claim
of
act
of
state,
but
has
simply
depended
upon
a
litigation
position
asserted
by
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
written
letters
the
secretary
of
state
of
the
united
states
often
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
not
part
of
the
debate,
whether
that
decree
of
nationalization
reached
the
assets
outside
of
cuba?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
one
is
challenging
this
litigation
that
cuba
by
its
decree
of
nationalization
could
seize
and
exert
sovereign
power
over
assets
in
cuba.
chief
justice

was
assets
somewhere
else

in

another
issue,
is
it
not?

we'll
resume
there
after
lunch
mr.
rabinowitz
chief
justice

whenever
you're
ready
mr.

the
sentence.
chief

didn't
--
just
very
often
we
give
the
counsel
their
choice.
chief
justice

e.
burger
mr.
friedman,
we'll
extend
your
time
to
five
minutes
from
your
previous
three.
chief

e.

it
was
desserted
as
a
defense
in
those
cases
that
the
money
was
owed
to

payable
to
cuba
as
the
new
owner?

e.
burger
mr.
rabinowitz
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
the
act
in
itself
was
an
innovation
come
along,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
have
any
basis
except
for
the
national
interest
of
the
country,
when
a
foreign
sovereign
comes
in
to
our
courts
asking
all
the
benefits
of
our
legal
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
matter
of
difference
by
the
judiciary
to
the
foreign
policy
problems
of
the
executive
branches
is
that
the
way
you
put
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
act
of
state
doctrine
or
its
substantial
equivalent
followed
by
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
cuba
a
plan?
chief

warren
e.
burger
very
well,
