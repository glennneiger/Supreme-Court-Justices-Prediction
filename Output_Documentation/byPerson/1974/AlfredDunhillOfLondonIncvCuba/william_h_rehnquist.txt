mr.
friedman,
your
response
to
justice
white's
question
that
you're
not
relying
on
new
york
procedural
niceties
has
certain
overtones
of
making
a
virtue
out
of
necessity
because
i
take
it
if
you
are
to
bottom
the
argument
on
procedural
niceties
that
this
is
really
nothing
like
a
set
off
in
the
traditional
synth
that
lawyers
use
the
word.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
petitioners
were
to
take
their
judgment
to
france
to
england
and
try
to
locate
cuban
assets
there
and
they
ask
for
full
faith
and
credit
whatever
the
french
or
english
are
equivalent
to
that
is.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
true
even
though
the
foreign
government
is
the
defendant?
say
maybe
just
has
a
ship
in
new
york
harbor
and
is
libeled
by
private
plaintiff?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
get
jurisdiction
over
a
foreign
government
other
than
by
attaching
their
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
that
case,
even
though
they
are
defendant
and
they
are
not
seeking
relief,
your
position
is
that
the
claim
of
the
private
plaintiff
can
be
adjudicated.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
say
such
repudiation,
is
not
an
act
of
state
for
purposes
of
sabbatino?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
hand
a
question
in
my
mind
even
though
i
did
not
indicate
mr.
rabinowitz,
if
you
are
right
in
your
argument
thus
far,
then
do
not
you
have
to
confront
the
government's
argument
or
would
you
say
that
this
is
not
a
commercial
transaction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
regard
to
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
international
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
(inaudible)
the
state
department
around
in
the
area
of
sovereign
immunity?
