mr.
antonin
scalia
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court?
the
principal
purpose
of
the
governments
appearing
as
amicus
in
the
present
case
is
to
preserve
the
vitality
of
a
legal
doctrine
which
is
not
itself
technically
at
issue
in
the
case
but
which
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
if
accepted
by
this
court
would
effectively
destroy.
i
refer
of
course
to
the
restrictive
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity,
under
which,
it
is
not
all
of
the
activities
of
a
foreign
sovereign
as
to
which
that
sovereign
will
not
be
held
accountable
in
our
courts
but
rather
only
those
activities
which
are
of
governmental
as
opposed
to
a
private
nature.
at
the
time,
the
famous
tate
letter
was
issued
by
the
state
department
in
1952,
that
modern
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
had
already
been
adopted
by
virtually
all
of
the
important
trading
nations
of
the
west.
the
significant
exceptions
were
england
and
the
united
states.
since
that
time,
only
last
november
in
the
philippine
admiral
case,
the
privy
council
has
made
england
is
no
longer
an
exception.
it
has
likewise
been
assumed
that
the
united
states
is
no
longer
an
exception
to
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity.
although
the
matter
has
never
reached
this
court,
it
has
been
considered
a
number
of
times
by
lower
federal
courts
and
by
state
courts,
and
their
decisions
are
uniform
in
accepting
it.
in
view
of
those
decisions,
in
view
of
the
tate
letter
and
in
view
of
the
deference
which
this
court
has
normally
accorded
to
the
state
department's
views
in
this
area
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
has
properly
been
assumed
that
the
applicable
united
states
law
does
adopt
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity.
respondents
have
not
asserted
sovereign
immunity
in
the
present
case
for
the
obvious
reason
that
the
assertion
would
not
have
been
permitted
under
the
restrictive
theory.
there
are
several
other
reasons
why
the
assertion
may
not
have
laid
as
well.
but
clearly
there
was
no
way,
in
which
the
merchandising
of
tobacco
or
the
receipt
of
an
erroneous
payment
in
connection
with
that
merchandising
activity
could
have
been
considered
as
governmental
activity
rather
that
a
commercial
activity
on
the
part
of
the
respondents.
that
being
so,
it
would
surely
reduce
the
law
to
ineffectiveness
and
perhaps
expose
it
to
ridicule,
if
the
respondent
having
being
denied,
the
claim
of
sovereign
immunity,
were
able
to
achieve
precisely
the
same
result
by
simply
appearing
and
repudiating
the
obligation
as
to
the
very
acts
on
which
the
claim
of
sovereign
immunity
was
denied.
nothing
occurred
in
this
case
except
the
appearance
of
an
attorney
who
instead
of
asserting
any
sovereign
immunity,
simply
asserted
that
the
government
of
cuba
would
not
honor
the
obligation
and
what
is
claimed
is
that
the
effect
of
that
statement
should
be
the
same
as
far
as
the
rights
of
these
parties
are
concerned
as
the
assertion
of
the
sovereign
immunity
under
the
old
absolute
theory.
respondents
reply
brief,
seeks
to
calm
our
fears
on
this
point
by
assuring
us
that
repudiation
of
a
commercial
obligation
will
be
unlikely.
respondents
says,
i
am
quoting
his
reply
brief
to
the
government
now
“it
is
only
in
the
unusual
case
and
we
suggest
primarily
in
the
political
case
in
which
this
defense
is
called
upon”.
that
is
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
he
continues
“it
is
likely
that
the
more
naked
the
repudiation,
that
is
the
more
unconnected
with
governmental
functions,
the
more
political
the
background”.
the
trouble
with
all
of
these
hopeful
assurances
is
that
they
are
destroyed
by
the
experience
of
this
very
case.
there
could
not
have
been
a
more
naked
repudiation.
the
mere
statement
of
council
in
the
case
and
as
to
the
high
political
background
of
the
repudiation,
its
non-existence
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
up
until
the
point
when
it
was
discovered
that
we
were
talking
about
a
lot
of
money,
cuba
was
willing
to
stipulate
on
the
point
and
indeed
did
so.
that
was
one
of
the
issues
below.
there
is
no
high
political
background
here,
it
is
simply
a
question
of
a
lot
of
money
and
until
it
was
clear
that
it
involved
with
a
lot
of
money,
cuba
did
not
care
about
the
point.
i
suggest
then
that
despite
what
the
respondents
assert
in
the
reply
brief.
if
the
theory
of
act
of
state,
that
respondent
is
arguing
in
this
case
is
adopted,
we
can
expect
the
state
trading
nations
to
use
it
precisely
where
they
previously
used
the
doctrine
of
absolute
sovereign
immunity,
that
is
wherever
they
do
not
wish
to
be
held
liable.
how
then
can
one
avoid
this
absurd
result?
on
one
hand
saying,
the
foreign
state
has
no
sovereign
immunity
but
on
the
other
saying,
which
means
the
sovereign
must
simply
appear
and
say
that
it
does
not
want
to
pay.
in
the
view
of
the
united
states,
it
is
difficult
not
to
avoid
that
result.
if
one
simply
regards
the
statement
and
the
application
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
as
it
has
historically
been
described
and
applied
by
this
court.
respondents
would
have
us
believe
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
applies
to
all
acts
of
a
sovereign
power.
but
whether
one
chooses
the
old
cases
or
the
new
ones,
whether
one
takes
the
formulation
in
underhill
or
in
sabbatino,
the
description
of
the
doctrine
has
always
shown
that
this
is
not
so.
there
have
been
qualifications
not
simply
a
statement
that
an
act
of
state
is
not
examinable.
in
underhill,
for
example,
the
doctrine
of
the
act
of
state
was
described
as
applicable
to
acts
done
by
sovereigns
within
their
own
states
in
the
exercise
of
governmental
authority,
two
qualifications,
in
their
own
states
and
in
the
exercise
of
governmental
authority.
in
sabbatino,
it
was
described
as
being
applicable
to
public
acts
of
a
recognized
foreign
sovereign
power
committed
within
its
own
territory.
in
other
words,
two
conditions
are
attached,
the
first
is
the
territorial
condition
that
the
act
of
state
must
have
been
performed
within
the
governments
own
territory.
one
may
interpret
that
territorial
condition,
literally
i
suppose
and
if
it
is
interpreted
literally,
the
only
act
of
state
that
appears
on
the
record
on
the
present
case
occurred
within
the
united
states
consisting
of
the
statement
of
the
council
for
cuba.
there
is
no
evidence
of
any
other
action
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
cuba.
the
united
states,
as
described
in
our
brief
mr.
antonin
scalia
no
sir,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was
any
contrary
evidence
adduced
to
show
that
the
lawyer
was
not
authorized.
i
believe
that
is
true
as
of
now,
yes
sir.
i
do
not
think
that
the
issue
of
whether
the
statement
of
the
lawyer
was
in
fact
authorized
is
really
present
in
this
petition.
of
course,
if
he
were
not
authorized,
then
the
matter
would
be
much
simpler
but
for
the
purposes
of
the
present
case,
i
think
that
it
is
assumed
that
the
statement
was
authorized
to
be
made
by
cuba
but
nevertheless,
the
only
act
of
cuba
mr.
antonin
scalia
i
do
not
know
sir.
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record
which
shows
--.
mr.
antonin
scalia
well,
certainly
something
was
done
in
cuba
but
i
would
not
consider
a
government
mr.
antonin
scalia
contrary
evidence
to
what
effect
sir?
mr.
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
is
correct.
i
think
that
the
conclusion
that
the
statement
of
the
lawyer
was
authorized
and
again
i
am
not
contesting
that
but
the
point
is,
the
only
action,
the
only
public
act
committed
by
cuba,
as
far
as
we
know,
surely
the
authorization
to
the
lawyer,
even
if
it
was
given
in
cuba
does
not
constitute
a
public
act
anymore
than
the
authorization
by
the
president
to
one
of
his
delegates
in
the
united
states
for
that
delegate
to
do
a
particular
act
constitutes
the
act
itself.
mr.
antonin
scalia
yes
sir,
well,
i
think
as
described
in
the
governments
brief,
we
think
that
the
issue
of
sabbatino
is
not
involved
in
this
case
because
the
act
of
state
doctrine
properly
understood,
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
there
was
no
act
of
state;
therefore
there
is
no
reason
for
sabbatino
to
be
presented
to
the
court
in
this
case.
if
however,
the
court
should
disagree
with
our
interpretation
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
and
if
the
court
should
find
when
sabbatino
spoke
of
an
act
of
state,
it
meant
an
act
of
state
which
could
even
consist
of
a
simple
repudiation
of
a
contractual
obligation.
then
i
would
assert
that
sabbatino
should
be
reexamined
but
there
on
that
point
on
whether
a
commercial
can
be
an
act
of
state
but
in
the
view
of
the
government,
there
is
really
no
need
to
get
to
that
issue
because
it
would
be
reading
sabbatino
to
be
unnecessarily
wrong.
if
one
were
to
read
its
description
of
act
of
state
to
include
this
simple
repudiation.
as
i
was
saying,
the
court's
decision
and
the
application
of
the
acts
of
state
doctrine
have
brought
forward
two
conditions,
the
territorial
conditions,
which
can
be
interpreted
literally
or
as
government
suggests
in
its
brief,
perhaps
can
better
be
interpreted
not
literally.
so
as
to
mean
the
act
of
state
must
be
committed
within
the
territory
of
the
state
and
if
it
is
committed
within
that
territory,
that
is
enough.
if
it
is
not,
that
is
absolutely
conclusive
that
there
is
no
act
of
state,
rather
we
think
that
the
expression
of
territoriality
is
really
a
description
of
the
most
common
situation
in
which
the
foreign
governmental
act
constitutes
an
act
as
to
which
there
is
such
a
preeminent
claim
of
the
foreign
government
to
exclusive
legislative
jurisdiction
over
the
matter
that
the
courts
of
the
united
states
should
not
interpose
our
reexamination
of
that
foreign
states
action.
it
is
the
second
qualification
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine
which
is
squarely
raised
in
the
present
case
which
is
of
most
importance
to
the
government.
that
the
qualification
that
the
act
of
state,
is
an
act
performed
in
the
exercise
of
governmental
authority
and
that
it
is
a
public
act.
respondents
would
have
us
believe
that
these
qualifications
mean
nothing
that
they
are
mere
surplusages
and
entirely
redundant
that
when
one
says
the
act
of
state,
one
has
said
it
all.
so
long
as
the
state
has
acted,
that
is
it
but
the
case
has
not
described
it
that
way.
they
have
felt
constrained
to
say,
an
act
of
the
state
in
the
exercise
of
its
governmental
authority
or
to
say
public
acts
of
a
state.
i
would
assert
to
the
contrary
of
respondent's
contention
that
it
is
not
the
governments
position
on
this
matter
that
is
new
or
novel,
what
is
truly
novel
and
inventive
is
the
repudiation
which
occurred
in
this
case.
if
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
indeed
were
understood
to
be
as
respondent
represents
it.
it
is
indeed,
marvelous
that
such
a
repudiation
before
an
american
court
has
never
to
our
knowledge
previously
occurred,
that
is
the
novelty
in
the
case,
not
the
government's
assertion
of
what
i
believe
that
have
been
understood
to
be
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
we
assert,
in
other
words,
that
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
victory
transport
case,
which
involved
precisely
this
issue,
whether
the
denomination
by
state
of
a
port
in
a
commercial
contract
as
a
safe
port
amounted
to
an
act
of
state
and
therefore
could
not
be
reexamined
in
litigation.
the
second
circuit
held
of
course
that
the
denomination
of
the
safe
port
in
a
contract
is
a
commercial
act
which
merchants
do
all
the
time.
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
done
by
a
state
or
by
a
state
trading
agency
makes
no
difference
and
does
not
prevent
the
courts
from
inquiring
into
the
case.
mr.
antonin
scalia
excuse
me
sir
mr.
antonin
scalia
yes
sir.
mr.
antonin
scalia
that
was
early
opinion
sir.
mr.
antonin
scalia
yes,
the
position
of
the
state
department
in
the
present
case,
it
has
not
sought
intervene
in
the
present
case
either.
the
position
of
the
government
on
the
matter
is
simply
that
the
interpretation
that
we
are
urging
of
this
act
of
state
doctrine
is
in
the
interest
of
the
executive
branch
and
should
be
adopted
by
the
courts
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
two
purposes
sought
to
be
achieved
by
the
act
of
state
doctrine
are
neither
of
them,
served
by
the
application
of
the
doctrine
to
commercial
transactions
because
if
you
are
concerned
about
first
of
all,
the
avoidance
of
embarrassment,
the
united
states
foreign
policy,
the
tate
letter
makes
it
clear
that
there
is
no
such
embarrassment
in
the
case
of
commercial
transactions
and
it
is
made
further
clear
by
the
appendix
to
the
governments
brief
in
this
case.
the
second
purpose,
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
court
to
avoid
cases
which
do
not
have
manageable
legal
standards,
that
purpose
also
was
not
served
by
adopting
an
act
of
state
doctrine
in
the
commercial
field
which
is
almost
the
prototype
of
a
field
of
where
there
are
manageable
legal
standards.
mr.
antonin
scalia
it
is
said
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
applied
by
a
number
of
other
countries
but
their
application
is
a
good
deal
less
clear
than
our
own
has
been.
i
am
unaware
of
any
statement
by
another
country
that
it
applies
to
commercial
transactions.
i
am
just
guarding
that
statement
with
the
fact
that
i
tend
to
think
that
the
application
by
other
countries
has
been
a
good
deal,
less
rational
than
our
--
at
least
their
description
of
it
has
been
a
good
deal
less
rational
than
our
own
in
any
event.
mr.
antonin
scalia
generally
mr.
antonin
scalia
i
am
certain
that
there
are
cases
in
foreign
countries
in
which
in
a
commercial
transaction
where
what
respondent
in
this
case
would
call
an
act
of
state
has
occurred,
the
foreign
court
has
given
no
regard,
and
has
not
given
any
special
treatment.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired
thank
you.
