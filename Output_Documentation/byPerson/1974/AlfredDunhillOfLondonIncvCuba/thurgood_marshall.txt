justice
thurgood
marshall
as
a
matter
--
in
fact
in
sabbatino
case,
they
refused
to
come
in
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
statement
of
the
lawyers
contradicted
any
place
up
until
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statement
made
authorized
is
made
in
cuba?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
it
is
here,
but
the
statement
was,
that
something
was
done
in
cuba.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
the
government
had
any
contrary
evidence
of
any
kind,
i
would
assume
they
would
have
shown.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fact
that
he
was
not
talking
about
the
truth,
the
fact
that
the
government
had
introduced
it
after
all
these
years
leaves
me
what
conclusion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
that
let
me
interrupt,
let
me
ask
one
more
question.
do
you
want
sabbatino
overruled
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
department
took
position
that
they
were
not
going
to
intervene
because
the
court
matter
was
pending,
sabbatino.
the
court
asked
for
the
state
departmentsâ€™
opinion
and
the
state
department
said
that
since
this
is
a
court
matter
we
will
give
you
our
opinion,
do
you
remember
that?
