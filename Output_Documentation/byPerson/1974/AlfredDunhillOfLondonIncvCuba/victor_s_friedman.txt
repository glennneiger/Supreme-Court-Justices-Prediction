mr.
victor
s.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
applied
the
act
of
state
doctrine
to
hold
the
petitioner,
alfred
dunhill
of
london,
could
not
obtain
an
affirmative
judgment
against
the
republic
of
cuba,
awarded
by
the
district
court.
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
with
respect
to
two
issues.
first
issue
is
whether
statement
of
counsel
made
at
the
trial
can
constitute
an
act
of
state.
as
to
that
issue,
we
contend
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
in
any
way
evidences,
a
sovereign
act
by
the
republic
of
cuba.
all
that
the
record
shows
in
this
respect
are
statements
by
counsel
for
the
republic
of
cuba
indicating
a
litigating
position
in
the
case.
the
second
issue
in
which
certiorari
was
granted
sua
sponte
by
this
court
was
whether
assuming
the
act
of
state
doctrine
applies
in
this
case,
whether
the
affirmative
judgment
nevertheless
should
be
reinstated
under
the
counter
claim
exception
set
forth
in
first
national
city
bank
against
banco
nacional
de
cuba.
as
to
that
issue,
we
contend
that
under
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
in
this
case
where
cuba
has
put
into
issue
in
a
single
proceeding
far
more
than
the
amount
of
the
counter
claims
awarded
against
us
--
against
it,
and
where
all
of
the
claims
and
counter
claims
arise
out
of
serious
of
related
transactions,
put
into
issue
by
cuba
in
our
courts
that
that
counter
claim
exception
should
apply.
because
of
the
position
taken
by
respondent's
counsel
in
their
brief
in
this
court,
the
position
being
that
the
record
does
not
justified
the
phrasing
of
the
questions
as
granted
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
i
think
it'd
important
that
the
background
of
this
litigation
be
set
forth
at
some
length
so
that
we
can
understand
precisely
what
is
in
the
record
and
the
significance
of
the
questions
as
framed
by
the
questions
as
framed
by
this
court.
litigation
arose
out
of
the
action
in
september
1960
of
the
republic
of
cuba
in
nationalizing
certain
cigar
factories
in
cuba.
that
action
was
turned
an
intervention,
a
euphemist.
and
for
that
reason,
the
cuban
government
and
its
representatives
in
this
case
are
often
referred
to
as
interventors.
the
persons
whose
factories
were
seized
are
very
often
referred
to
as
the
owners.
for
a
long
time
prior
to
the
intervention,
dunhill,
as
well
as
other
importers
had
purchased
cigars
from
the
owners.
indeed,
for
a
short
period
after
the
intervention,
the
importers,
against
including
dunhill
continued
to
purchase
cigars
from
cuba.
and
during
the
immediate
post-intervention
period
continue
to
make
payments
for
shipments
of
cigars
that
had
been
shipped
prior
to
the
intervention.
the
owners
of
course
immediately
after
the
intervention
fled
cuba;
some
of
them
coming
here
to
the
united
states.
in
early
1961,
the
owner
instituted
nine
actions
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
four
of
them
were
against
dunhill.
by
these
actions,
the
owners
in
essence
sought
to
obtain
payments
for
cigar
shipped
both
before
and
after
the
intervention.
shortly
thereafter,
the
interventors
brought
their
own
action,
not
against
the
importers
but
against
the
owner's
counsel
in
an
action
entitled
policio
against
russian
block.
by
that
action,
the
interventors
in
essence
sought
to
claim
the
right
to
sue
for
the
same
matters
on
which
the
owners
had
already
institute
it
suit.
since
the
importers
were
essentially
in
the
position
of
stake
holder
in
these
actions,
the
district
court
stay
the
actions
against
them
and
proceeded
to
resolve
the
threshold
and
significant
disputes
between
the
owners
and
the
interventors
regarding
who
is
entitled
to
payment
of
what
cigars.
insofar
as
relevant
here,
the
district
court
for
judge
o'brien
in
1966
and
under
the
decision
that
was
later
affirmed
per
curium
by
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
interventors
were
entitled
to
sue
for
the
post-intervention
shipments.
in
essence,
the
court
held
that
at
least
with
respect
to
cuban
assets
under
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
sabbatino
and
the
act
of
state
doctrine
set
forth
there,
the
nationalization
decree
of
1960
was
effective
as
to
the
seized
cuban
assets.
at
this
point
in
time
however,
the
significant,
and
we're
talking
now
about
1967,
the
interventors
stipulated
before
the
district
court
that
the
owners
were
entitled
to
recover
for
free
intervention
shipments.
the
assumption
by
both
the
owners
and
the
interventors
some
seven
years
after
the
event
being
that
these
amounts
were
to
insignificant
to
concern
themselves
with.
after
the
rulings
in
policio
against
russian
block,
the
interventors
were
allowed
to
intervene
this
time
in
the
procedural
sense
in
the
nine
actions
in
new
york.
the
actions
were
in
fact
consolidated
for
trial,
tried
together
and
appeal
together
to
the
second
circuit.
during
the
course
of
trial
preparation
however
and
the
course
of
the
trial
itself,
it
developed
that
as
of
the
day
of
the
intervention,
there
had
been
almost
$500,000.00
in
unpaid
amounts
for
cigar
shipped
prior
to
the
intervention.
hardly
and
insignificance
on
this
had
been
thought
by
both
the
owners
and
interventors
when
they
entered
into
their
stipulation
in
1967.
it
further
developed
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings
that
the
importers
shortly
after
the
intervention
had
in
fact
paid
all
of
the
sums
in
accordance
with
their
long
standing
practice
of
paying
on
30,
60
or
90
days
terms.
at
that
point,
cuba
of
course
changed
its
position
and
sought
to
back
off
from
its
stipulation
that
had
entered
--
it
had
intervened
to
in
policio
against
russian
block.
they
contended
now
that
they
should
be
entitled
to
the
pre-intervention
shipments
as
well.
and
not
only
that,
they
contended
that
they
never
received
those
payments
if
in
fact
they
had
been
made.
the
district
court
however
found
that
not
only
had
the
payments
been
made
by
the
importers,
but
that
cuba
in
fact
had
received
them.
in
the
case
of
dunhill,
those
payments
amounted
to
some
$55,000.00
more
than
the
district
court
found
dunhill
still
owed
for
the
post-intervention
shipments.
in
the
case
of
the
importers
as
a
group
however,
the
situation
was
reversed
because
far
more
was
still
ode
to
the
interventors
by
the
importers
as
a
group
for
the
post-intervention
shipments
than
the
district
court
found
had
been
paid
to
cuba
for
the
pre-intervention
shipments.
judge
o'brien
ruled
that
the
owners
were
entitled
to
payment
for
the
pre-intervention
shipments.
he
also
ruled
that
the
interventors
had
received
those
payments
and
reliable
under
an
unjust-enrichment
theory
to
return
them
to
the
importers.
in
his
initial
decision,
he
allowed
the
importers
to
set
off
against
what
they
owed
for
the
post-intervention
shipments
the
amounts
that
they
had
paid
for
the
pre-intervention
shipments.
he
specifically
ruled
the
act
of
state
doctrine
inapplicable
to
the
payments
received
by
cuba,
stating
in
part,
and
i'm
quoting
this
portion
of
an
opinion
now.
“here,
all
that
occurred
was
a
statement
by
counsel
for
the
interventors
during
trial
that
the
cuban
government
and
the
interventors
denied
liability
and
had
refused
to
make
repayment.”
this
statement
was
made
after
the
interventors
had
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
in
order
to
pursue
their
claims
against
the
importers
for
post-intervention
shipments.
it
is
hard
to
conceive
how
if
such
a
statement
can
be
elevated
to
the
status
of
an
act
of
state
any
refusal
by
any
state
to
honor
any
obligation
at
any
time
could
be
considered
anything
else,
should
note
panthetically
at
this
point
that
it
was
apparent
that
the
set
off
procedure
described
by
judge
o'brien
in
his
initial
opinion
obviously
did
not
take
account
of
dunhill's
situation.
accordingly
after
the
decision
was
rendered,
we
move
for
an
affirmative
judgment
against
the
interventors.
despite
the
claim
and
trial
of
an
act
of
state,
the
interventors
expressed
no
opposition
to
this
and
there
being
no
opposition,
that
motion
was
granted.
the
second
circuit
of
course
affirmed
judge
o'brien's
decision
in
all
respects
except
one.
it
reversed
the
affirmative
judgment
in
favor
of
dunhill
on
the
ground
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
it
found
the
act
of
state
in
cuba's
failure
to
honor
the
importer's
demand
for
return
of
the
payments,
and
i'm
quoting
now,
“confirmed
by
the
cuban
government's
counsel
at
trial.”
in
short,
regardless
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
language
was,
there
is
no
question
that
on
the
record,
the
only
conceivable
evidence
of
any
act
of
state
by
the
cuban
government
was
simply
the
statements
by
counsel
for
the
cuban
government
that
its
client
would
not
honor
a
claim
for
return
of
the
funds.
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
of
course
is
to
force
dunhill
to
pay
twice
for
the
same
cigars,
having
already
paid
the
interventors.
under
the
court's
ruling,
they
must
now
pay
the
owners
with
interest.
we
submit
therefore
that
despite
the
statements
in
respondent's
brief
to
the
contrary,
the
first
issue
is
properly
before
this
court
that
is
whether
statements
of
counsel
can
constitute
an
act
of
state.
and
we
submit
as
well
that
for
the
reason's
set
forth
in
our
brief
that
they
cannot.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
yes,
that's
in
the
joint
appendix
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
and
there's
a
joint
appendix
as
well.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
yes
your
honor,
i
would
say
there
is.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
well
your
honor,
this
is
a
rather
special
circumstance.
i
think
we
must
recognize
that
in
all
other
instances
were
cuba
has
been
before
this
or
any
other
court,
they
have
appeared
armed
with
a
decree
which
states
certain
consequences,
usually
confiscation
of
property.
we
have
a
situation
in
this
case
however
were
up
until
that
last
year,
not
only
has
cuba
certainly
not
issued
any
decree
with
respect
to
these
funds,
but
is
been
actively
contending
in
our
courts
that
they
never
receive
them.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
a
far
crime
from
stating
that
we
have
funds
and
we
hereby
seize
them
to
say
in
the
other
instance
that
we
are
coming
into
your
courts
to
try
to
collect
those
funds,
and
then
when
the
proof
come
out
that
they
already
had
them
to
deny
received
of
the
funds.
that
is
not
a
seizure
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
situation
is
far
different
and
that
there
is
a
real
debt,
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
no,
i
do
not.
clearly,
there
are
circumstances
where
some
act,
some
public
sovereign
act
of
the
state
maybe
proved
by
other
than
a
formal
decree.
there
are
a
number
of
cases,
most
of
them
occur
in
time
of
civil
strife
or
rebellion
where
a
military
officer
for
example
goes
in
and
seizes
property.
that
is
not
a
formal
act.
but
every
case
which
has
decided
the
act
of
state
doctrine
has
insisted
that
there
be
some
public
affirmative
act,
something
that
one
can
look
at
and
say
“this
is
the
affirmative
act
of
the
sovereign”,
something
with
a
sovereigness
acting
so
that
if
this
court
or
any
court
in
this
country
where
to
take
a
contrary
position,
it
could
be
considered
in
a
front
to
the
sovereignty
of
that
nation.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
not
only
that
in
every
case
which
has
dealt
with
the
doctrine,
our
courts
have
required
a
proof
in
our
courts
of
the
fact
of
that
act
in
the
foreign
jurisdiction,
that
is
correct.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
pon?
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
i'm
sorry.
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case,
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
respondents
appear
to
concede
in
their
brief
and
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
concession,
but
they
do
appear
to
concede
that
statements
of
counsel
in
fact
cannot
constitute
an
act
of
state.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
12
of
respondent's
brief
in
that
respect.
they
seek
to
avoid
the
issue
by
in
affect
asserting
that
counsel
was
simply
the
agency
by
which
cuba
made
known
its
legal
position.
we
suggest
that
this
simply
does
not
square
with
the
cases.
as
i
have
said,
every
case
which
has
does
far
considered
the
application
of
this
doctrine
has
insisted
that
there
be
some
affirmative
act
of
the
foreign
sovereign
as
the
chief
justice
says
pointed
out
within
it's
own
territory,
and
then
as
a
second
requirement
that
there
be
confident
proof
of
the
existence
of
that
act
within
our
courts.
here,
for
all
that
counsel
has
said,
we
still
do
not
know
what
the
act
was.
we
do
not
know
when
it
took
place
or
how
it
took
place
or
who
is
responsible
for
it.
in
this
connection,
we've
cited
the
case
of
the
navemar
which
all
be
the
case
dealing
with
sovereign
immunity.
i
think
his
instructive
in
terms
of
the
standards
of
at
least
minimal
proof
required
when
a
sovereign
comes
into
our
courts
and
asserts
a
claim
that
it
should
be
treated
differently
from
private
litigates.
in
the
navemar,
there
was
a
verified
statement
by
the
ambassador
of
spain
that
his
government
had
in
fact
seized
possession
and
ownership
of
a
libel
vessel.
there
being
some
question
about
those
facts.
the
court
refused
to
foreclose
these
issues,
but
instead,
invited
the
ambassador
to
intervene
in
the
action
and
prosecute
his
claims
as
a
litigant
in
the
suit.
suggest
moreover
that
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
act
of
state
application
here
was
far
broader
than
in
any
of
the
decided
cases,
that
there
are
no
policy
reasons
underlying
the
act
of
state
doctrine
which
would
require
any
less
proof
than
we
are
contending
for.
the
doctrine
itself
as
the
respondents
concede
of
necessity
works
in
unfairness.
as
to
any
litigant
against
whom
the
doctrine
is
applied,
it
denies
him
his
judicial
remedies.
true,
if
the
courts
are
attempting
to
deal
with
a
public
act
or
pronouncement
of
a
foreign
government,
certainly,
they're
maybe
a
realistic
danger
that
the
courts
either
maybe
involved
in
political
controversy
in
international
affairs
were
may
be
usurping
executive
prerogatives
in
those
affairs.
but
surely,
we're
--
there
is
no
public
act
of
a
foreign
sovereign.
we
submit
that
those
dangers
are
unrealistic.
and
that
to
apply
the
doctrine,
to
create
the
unfairness,
unless
there
is
a
realistic
basis
in
fact
on
which
the
courts
can
operate,
simply
does
not
make
sense.
and
we
submit
that
that
requires
nothing
less
than
competent
evidence
at
the
trial
that
an
affirmative
act
of
a
foreign
sovereign
has
in
fact
occurred.
and
here
as
we
know
nothing
of
a
sort
has
occurred.
i
reviewed
the
history
of
the
case
at
some
length
because
i
wanted
to
show
that
for
some
10
years,
cuba
apparently
was
either
unaware
or
at
the
very
least
disputed
the
receipt
of
the
varying
monies,
counsel
for
cuba
and
assets,
it
has
seized
at
sometime
that
we
don't
know
and
in
some
manner
which
we
also
don't
know.
there
is
a
suggestion
to
respondent's
brief
that
i
feel
should
be
discussed
briefly.
at
page
17,
respondents
appeared
to
argue
that
the
nationalization
decree
of
1960
might
be
the
act
of
state
which
justifies
the
retention
of
petitioner's
payments.
the
argument
appears
to
be
that
since
that
decree
nationalized,
the
accounts
receivable
of
the
owners
that
payments
on
those
accounts,
at
least
in
so
far
as
they
reach
cuba
may
also
have
been
taken
under
the
authority
of
that
decree.
both
courts
below
and
of
course
held
under
the
republic
of
iraq
case
that
the
decree
was
in
effective
to
reach
those
accounts
receivable
because
they
were
assets
located
outside
of
the
jurisdiction
of
cuba
being
payable
in
new
york.
we
believe
that
ruling
was
correct,
but
we
do
want
to
point
out
that
if
this
is
respondent's
position
now
and
if
that
word
to
be
adopted,
we
must
note
that
to
the
extent
that
the
court
rule
in
that
fashion.
the
rulings
of
the
courts
below
with
respect
to
parties
not
now
before
it
would
also
be
affected
because
if
the
court
were
to
rule
that
the
decree
somehow
operated
with
respect
to
the
accounts
receivable
insofar
as
payments
on
those
accounts
reach
cuba,
then
we
would
submit
that
the
--
that
such
a
ruling
would
then
effect
extinguished
the
accounts
receivable
themselves,
and
the
owner's
judgments
against
dunhill
to
that
effect
would
also
be
extinguished.
i
turn
now
to
the
second
argument,
one
of
the
second
branch
of
the
argument
which
assumes
that
the
court
finds
--
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
effective
here.
and
the
question
is
assuming
that
effect
is
this
case
within
the
counter
claim
exception
created
by
city
bank
in
view
of
the
fact
that
petitioners
counter
claim
here
does
not
exceed
the
net
balance
owed
to
cuba
by
all
of
the
other
importers
who
are
consolidated
for
trial
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
in
view
of
the
totality
of
circumstances
of
this
case
that
the
counter
claim
exception
should
in
fact
be
applied.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
the
circumstances
here
are
far
stronger
for
justifying
the
application
of
that
doctrine
than
they
were
in
city
bank.
in
city
bank,
of
course,
they
were
many
differences
of
views
among
the
different
justices.
but
we
think
that
two-threads
run
through
the
various
opinions.
i've
have
already
alluded
to
them
in
my
argument
on
the
first
point,
they
are
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
really
serves
two
fundamental
purposes.
one
is
involved
with
not
having
this
court
enter
into
areas
which
are
more
properly
reserved
for
the
executive,
the
other
is
that
this
court
should
not
be
involve
in
deciding
issues
with
may
affect
our
foreign
relations.
i
do
not
and
i'm
thankful,
i
do
not
for
purposes
of
this
case
have
to
get
into
the
question
as
to
which
of
those
is
the
more
important
because
i
think
under
either
view,
it
is
quite
clear
that
allowing
the
counter
claim
here
to
the
extent
of
all
of
the
judgments
in
favor
of
cuba
would
not
violate
either
of
those
principles.
we
must
recall
that
this
case
like
any
other
that
we
have
found
involves
cuba's
coming
into
our
courts
and
affirmatively
seeking
relief
on
the
questions
of
who
was
entitled
to
the
payment
of
all
of
the
cigars.
initially,
they
came
in
and
asked
for
payments
of
all.
they
then
retreated
when
they
found
that
they
were
significant
amounts
due
on
the
post-intervention
ship
--
for
the
pre-intervention
shipments.
they
went
back
and
again,
sued
for
all
of
it.
the
only
thing
that
happened
after
that
was
that
having
as
the
courts,
as
the
evidence
manted
and
as
it
became
clear
that
they
might
loose
on
some
of
those
issues.
they
retreated
into
an
act
of
state
defense
to
the
assertion
of
a
judgment.
cuba
has
never
in
this
case
said
that
anything
they
have
done
with
respect
to
those
accounts
receivable
and
the
amounts
payable
on
the
cigars
should
not
be
treated
by
this
courts
as
a
judicial
issue.
in
fact,
cuba
has
submitted
these
very
issues
to
the
courts.
the
only
reason
the
act
of
state
doctrine
has
been
asserted
here
is
because
on
some
of
those
issues,
cuba
seemed
to
being
coming
out
a
loser.
that
is
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
so
far
as
i
know,
nothing
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
my
understanding
sir
is
that
they
will
do
that
if
any
party
or
the
court
requested.
we
did
not
feel
it
was
appropriate
to
request
it
in
this
instance
because
we
did
not
believe
there
was
any
proof
whatsoever
that
an
act
of
state
had
occurred.
we
believe
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
well,
i'm
perfectly
prepared
to
accept
that
mr.
chief
justice.
in
addition,
i
might
point
out
that
i
believe
that
the
stevenson
letter
which
goes
beyond
the
city
bank
case
would
also
talks
about
like
cases,
would
i
believe
be
applicable
here.
if
anything
this
case
presents
certainly
far
less
rational
for
and
abstention
by
the
judiciary,
then
first
national
city
bank
did.
after
all
in
first
national
city
bank,
the
effect
of
this
court's
ruling
was
to
have
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
actually
rule
on
the
legality
of
the
seizure
by
the
castro
government
of
first
national
city's
cuban
bank.
here,
we
have
nothing
of
the
sort.
all
of
the
legal
issues
have
already
been
decided.
the
factual
issues
have
already
been
decided.
the
only
that
issue
here
is
the
entry
of
a
judgment.
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
this
court
is
being
asked
as
against
an
act
of
state
contention
to
rule
on
matters
which
may
involve
some
kind
of
sensitive
foreign
relations
possibilities.
i
might
also
point
out
that
it
appears
that
the
--
mr.
rabinowitz
has
been
in
contact
with
the
state
department,
although
the
appendix
to
his
brief
with
regard
to
the
office
of
foreign
assets
treasury
department.
so,
the
executive
branch
is
obviously
where
the
case.
i
would
conclude
simply
by
saying
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
a
number
of
instances
where
both
the
executive
and
legislative
trends,
it
seems
to
us
or
distinctly
going
toward
looking
at
this
favor
with
any
expansion
of
view
the
act
of
state
doctrine
where
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
we
think
that
this
case
to
the
extent
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
an
act
of
state
doctrine
applicable.
clearly
is
such
an
expansion
and
we
see
no
reason
why
the
courts
in
the
face
of
the
decided
legislative
and
executive
trend
to
the
contrary
should
get
involved
in
expanding
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
well,
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
a
set
off?
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
no,
i
believe
it
would
not
be.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
that's
correct.
we
would
have
to
attach
the
judgment.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
but
let
me
point
out
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
i
believe
it
is,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
right.
not
on
a
technical
or
procedural
ground.
my
point
simply
is
that
cuba
has
put
into
issue
in
a
single
litigating
mode
all
these
claims
and
counter
claims.
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
rational
for
allowing
a
complete
set
off
or
counter
claim
within
this
framework,
regardless
of
the
precise
form
that
it
took
is
far
stronger
than
was
present
in
city
bank.
there
are
no
--
to
my
way
of
thinking,
there
are
no
justifications
with
underly
the
application
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
which
in
any
way,
should
preclude
that
result,
whereas
in
city
bank,
they're
very
definitely
were
different
policy
considerations
which
could
have
let
the
court
to
the
other
result.
so,
i
am
not
relying
on
the
technicality
of
whether
or
not
these
were
consolidated
for
trial
or
consolidated
action.
i
do
not
think
that
new
york
procedural
niceties
should
control
the
ruling
of
this
court
in
that
respect.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
well,
i'm
afraid
if
i
answer
that
question,
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
i
luminate
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine
and
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
no.
i
don't
really
at
all
mr.
chief
justice.
in
fact,
i
think,
i
can
live
within
the
decided
precedence
on
the
subject.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
we
--
to
the
extent
that
we
would
be
reaching
a
judgment
by
a
co-defendant.
i
would
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
right.
we're
trying
as
hard
as
we
can
in
all
of
these
cases
to
build
that
fund
up
as
high
as
it
can.
the
same
question
was
raised
i
think
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
the
city
bank
case.
our
goal
in
this
case
and
in
the
chase
case
which
is
behind
us
hasn't
come
up
there
yet,
is
just
to
increase
that
fund
because
that's
what
my
client
thinks
is
in
its
best
interest.
and
that
which
i
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
respond
to
a
few
remarks
made
by
counsel
for
respondents.
i
turn
first
to
the
question
again
of
what
is
the
act
of
state
in
this
case,
and
mr.
rabinowitz
is
indicated
that
it
may
proceed
from
one
of
two
standpoints,
and
i'm
still
confused
is
to
where
we
really
look
to
it.
i
simply
want
to
point
out
again
however
that
if
it
is
the
decree,
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
can
rule
with
respect
to
that
issue
on
this
petition.
that
is
something
that
has
not
been
raised
by
the
respondent's
previous
to
this
time,
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
that
would
affect
rights
of
other
parties
to
this
action
that
where
are
not
now
before
this
court.
if
on
the
other
hand,
we
are
still
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
possible
seizure
or
retention
of
assets
independently
of
the
decree.
i
would
suggest
again
that
the
remarks
in
our
brief
are
fully
applicable,
and
that
is
there
has
been
no
proof
whatsoever
that
any
sovereign
act
on
the
part
of
cuba
in
any
form
that
is
acceptable
as
evidence
in
our
courts.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
questions
that
our
counsel
has
raised
with
respect
to
the
enforceability
of
this
judgment.
i
do
not
pretend
for
a
minute
that
i
will
soon
be
a
simple
matter
of
simply
going
into
court
and
enforcing
this
judgment
the
way
one
would
and
the
other
civil
judgment.
i
do
not
agree
with
counsel
for
respondents
that
this
is
a
worthless
piece
of
paper.
there
are
a
number
of
possible
ways
the
judgment
might
be
enforced.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
need
consider
how
likely
those
possibilities
are
or
just
exactly
what
our
chances
will
be
to
obtain
a
recovery
under
the
judgment.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
are
possibilities
and
we
should
be
entitled
to
pursue
them.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
the
set
off
is
not
money
in
the
pocket
your
honor,
no
sir.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
its
money
we
--
for
--
the
money
that
we
owe
for
the
post-intervention
shipments,
that
has
already
been
paid
to
cuba
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
--
for
the
pre-intervention
shipments.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
to
the
extent
that
those
are
payments
for
the
pre-intervention
shipments,
we
still
must
pay
the
owners.
so,
there
is
no
money
in
the
pocket
there.
in
fact
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
if
we
were
to
recover
on
this
judgment
in
full,
there's
still
would
not
be
a
single
penny
coming
to
dunhill;
that
would
stay
with
dunhill.
dunhill
would
simply
have
to
turn
that
money
over
to
the
owners.
the
only
question
is
whether
we're
going
to
have
to
pay
the
owners
and
not
recover
back
from
the
--
from
cuba.
there's
no
way
that
dunhill
can
recover
a
single
penny
here
that
goes
into
dunhill's
pockets.
that
really
raises
another
issue
that
was
alluded
to
by
counsel
for
respondents,
and
that
is
the
question
of
why
didn't
dunhill
file
a
claim?
the
simple
answer
is
here,
that
dunhill
was
never
seeking
anything
from
anybody.
the
only
reason
that
dunhill
is
in
the
position
that
is
in
now
is
because
of
the
conflicting
claims
that
were
asserted
against
it
by
both
the
owners
and
the
interventors.
dunhill,
as
well
as
the
other
importers
always
considering
themselves
in
the
position
of
stakeholder,
and
along
that
same
lines,
i
would
suggest
that
the
cut-off
date,
which
was
allude
to
for
filing
of
claims,
we
do
not
think
as
it
all
applicable
here
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first,
that
refers
to
expropriations
of
property.
and
as
i've
indicated,
we
do
not
believe
there
ever
was
any
expropriation
here.
secondly,
whatever
the
claim
is
that
we
might
file
to
our
knowledge
was
not
in
existence
as
of
that
cut-off
date
sometime
in
1967.
if
your
honors
will
recall
at
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
well,
i
would
hope
not
mr.
justice.
the
problem
is
that
as
of
that
point
in
time,
cuba
was
still
contesting
that
they'd
ever
received
any
money.
so,
it
was
hardly
lay
in
our
must
to
make
a
claim
against
them
for
money
which
a
court
might
later
judge.
cuba
owed
us,
but
we
couldn't
collect
of
them.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
the
owners
brought
suit
in
the
february
or
march
of
1961.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
yes.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
so
far
as
i
know,
as
soon
as
those
cases
were
filed,
the
interventors
then
started
their
action
against
the
owner's
counsel,
and
all
proceedings,
vis-à-vis,
the
importers
were
stayed.
so
far
as
i
know,
i
don't
believe
that
the
importers
had
any
connection
with
these
cases,
except
to
be
named
as
defendants
by
the
owners
until
1967
--
or
1966
i
guess.
i
would
just
make
one
other
point
with
respect
to
the
question
of
a
license.
counsel
has
stated
that
the
office
of
foreign
assets
control
has
said
in
no
one
certain
terms
that
a
license
will
not
be
issued.
i
think
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
appendix
to
respondent's
brief
which
contains
the
exchange
of
correspondents
between
the
respondents
and
that
office
it
will
find
that
that
is
not
the
position
of
that
office.
they
had
set
forth
a
general
policy,
but
that
does
not
say
that
that
is
their
final
position
or
if
it
is,
then,
it
would
not
be
subject
to
review
in
the
courts,
or
that
it
might
not
be
influenced
by
a
ruling
by
this
court
in
this
proceeding.
thank
you.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
pursuant
to
this
courts’
order
of
last
june
which
we
stored
this
case
to
the
calendar
for
re-argument,
directing
the
parties
to
address
the
question
of
whether
this
court's
holding
in
banco
nacional
de
cuba
versus
sabbatino
should
be
reconsidered.
the
united
states
filed
a
brief
amicus
and
we
have
seated
15
minutes
of
our
time
for
oral
argument
to
the
government.
on
this
question,
our
position,
supported
by
the
united
states
is
that
sabbatino
should
be
reconsidered
insofar
as
it
maybe
read
to
permit
a
foreign
sovereign
to
utilize
the
act
of
state
doctrine
to
repudiate
its
commercial
obligations.
the
amount
of
foreign
trade
being
conducted
by
government
agencies
continues
to
increase
in
size
and
importance.
largely,
as
a
result
of
that,
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
united
states
and
elsewhere
has
been
restricted
so
that
a
government,
acting
in
a
commercial
capacity
may
not
assert
sovereign
immunity
as
a
defense
to
defeat
adjudication
of
claims
properly
brought
against
it.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
well,
the
assertion
of
a
claim
against
the
property
of
the
foreign
government
stands
on
a
somewhat
different
footing
but
the
actual
adjudication
of
claims
against
the
foreign
government
when
you
eliminate
the
property
difficulties
that
some
courts
have
had.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
one
can
and
in
some
occasion
serve
a
trading
agency
if
it
has
an
office
in
the
united
states
conserved
under
some
long
arm
statutes
and
one
can
get
jurisdiction.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
absolutely
your
honor,
certainly
under
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity,
there
have
been
some
difficulties
where
the
state
department
for
example
may
come
in
and
suggest
immunity
even
though
the
case
would
seem
to
be
covered
by
the
restrictive
theory.
but
absent
such
as
suggestion,
the
rule
today
is
fairly
unanimous
in
the
united
states’
courts
that
such
a
claim
can
be
adjudicated.
we
do
not
see
any
reason
why
a
foreign
government
should
be
able
to
accomplish
the
same
result
that
it
could
have
accomplished
under
sovereign
immunity,
simply
by
characterizing
a
repudiation
of
its
obligations
as
an
active
state.
before
addressing
this
question
more
fully,
however
we
feel
that
compelled
distress
here
as
we
have
in
our
briefs
that
this
issue
need
be
reached
by
the
court
only
if
certain
threshold
issues
are
passed.
in
particular
we
do
not
believe
this
issue
need
be
reached
unless
this
court
agrees
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
act
of
state
in
issue
here
was
indeed
cuba’s
repudiation
of
its
obligation
to
return
to
dunhill,
certain
payments
that
dunhill
had
made
to
cuba
for
cigars.
i
stress
this
because
cuba
now
appears
to
argue
with
us
contrary
to
its
prior
position
and
although
for
different
reasons
that
this
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
incorrect.
in
order
to
put
these
contentions
in
context
and
explain
some
of
these
threshold
questions,
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
the
history
of
litigation
in
a
capsule
form.
litigation
arouse
out
of
the
1960
decree
in
cuba,
which
nationalized
or
intervened
certain
cuban
cigar
factories.
dunhill
and
two
other
united
states
importers
for
number
of
years
simply
stood
on
the
side
lines
as
stake
holders.
while
the
former
owners
of
these
businesses
in
cuba
battled
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
to
determine
which
of
them
was
entitled
to
payments
for
cigar
shipped
both
before
and
after
the
intervention?
in
the
prior
action,
not
involving
dunhill
and
the
other
importers,
palicio
v.
brush
&
bloch,
it
was
held
by
the
second
circuit
that
the
interveners
could
recover
from
all
of
the
post
intervention
shipments
of
the
cigars.
the
interveners
at
that
point
stipulated
that
the
owners
could
recover
from
the
pre-interventions
shipments
because
in
their
view
the
amounts
were
too
small
to
worry
about.
after
those
threshold
issues
were
resolved,
both
the
owners
and
the
interveners
pressed
their
claims
against
the
importers.
that
is
this
action,
later
then
developed
in
this
action
that
the
fundamental
assumption
which
underlay
that
stipulation
was
incorrect
because
it
turned
out
as
of
the
date
of
the
intervention,
there
was
unpaid,
almost
a
half
a
million
dollars
for
pre-intervention
shipments
of
cigars.
it
further
developed
in
our
case
and
it
was
strenuously
contested
by
the
interveners
that
the
importers
had
paid
those
sum
shortly
after
the
interveners
and
it
further
developed
that
those
payments
had
found
their
way
to
the
cuban
government.
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
district
court
ruled
that
those
amounts
were
still
owed
by
the
importers
to
the
owners.
we
had
paid
the
wrong
people
but
we
could
recover
those
amounts
from
cuba.
in
the
case
of
dunhill,
because
the
amounts
transmitted
to
cuba
exceeded
by
some
$55,000,
the
amount
due
for
cigar
shipment
after
the
intervention.
the
district
court
entered
in
affirmative
judgment
in
favor
of
dunhill
against
cuba
in
that
amount.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
courts
rulings
in
every
respect,
except
one.
it
set
aside
the
affirmative
judgment
against
cuba
in
favor
of
dunhill.
the
court
of
appeals
held
again
over
cuba’s
vigorous
opposition
that
the
evidence
showed,
that
cuba
had
received
all
of
the
post
intervention
payments,
but
it
also
held
that
cuba’s,
“failure
to
honor
the
importers
demand”
for
return
of
the
payments
constituted
and
act
of
state,
therefore
under
sabbatino
and
first
national
city
bank,
no
affirmative
judgment
could
be
entered
against
cuba.
dunhill
of
course
is
seeking
nothing
in
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
absolutely
your
honor
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
with
respect
to
dunhill
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
no
your
honor.
on
that
issue,
the
issue
on
the
accounts
receivable,
the
court
held
since
the
accounts
receivable
had
the
united
states
situs
that
no
act
of
state
would
be
recognized.
the
net
effect,
of
course
of
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
is
to
impose
double
liability
against
dunhill
for
the
amounts
which
now
can
not
be
recovered
against
cuba.
under
the
rulings
of
the
court
now,
that
money
is
still
owed
by
dunhill
to
the
owners
and
there
is
no
recovery
over.
the
first
threshold
question,
before
we
reach
sabbatino,
of
course
remains
the
principal
question
on
which
certiori
was
originally
granted.
that
is,
whether
statements
by
counsel
for
cuba,
that
petitioners,
justin
richmond
counter
claim
would
not
be
honored
by
his
client
constitute
or
evidence
an
act
of
state.
we
continue
to
urge
as
we
did
before,
that
in
our
view,
that
those
statements
that
cuba
would
refuse
to
make
any
such
repayments
did
not
and
could
constitute
an
act
of
state.
we
will
not
delay
with
that
argument
here
again.
we
note
only
that
if
only
our
position
is
accepted
in
that
regard.
reexamination
of
sabbatino,
however
desirable
in
unnecessary
to
decision
of
the
case,
the
result
would
simply
be
the
revert
to
judge
brian’s
ruling
and
reinstate
the
affirmative
judgment
he
entered
against
cuba.
the
second
major
threshold
issue
is
created
by
cuba’s
complete
shift
in
position,
as
to
precisely
what
constitutes
the
operative
act
of
state
against
dunhill
in
this
case.
court
of
appeals
of
course
stood
for
the
repudiation
of
the
obligation
to
pay
dunhill.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
sovereign
immunity
has
never
been
asserted
by
cuba
in
this
case
and
indeed
you
honor
it
could
not
have
been
asserted
because
of
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
now
adopted
by
the
courts.
although
cuba
has
never
requested
a
suggestion
of
sovereign
immunity
from
the
state
department,
i
think
with
the
state
departments’
present
position
that
would
be
unlikely.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
so
far
as
we
know
mr.
justice
stevens,
cuba
has
never
said
anything
about
this
obligation.
cuba
brought
all
of
these
contentions
into
the
united
states
courts
seeking
the
money’s
which
it
later
turned
out
that
they
had
already
received.
so
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
address
your
questions
in
those
terms.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
if
i
may
your
honor,
let
me
respond
to
you,
this
is
a
third
position
that
cuba
is
now
taking
as
i
see
it
for
the
first
time
in
its
reply
to
the
government's
a
to
make
it
brief.
one
of
the
great
difficulties
we
have
had
i
think,
in
analyzing
the
act
of
state
issue
here
is
identifying
it.
it
is
quite
clear
that
up
to
the
time
that
certiori
was
granted
in
this
case,
the
only
act
of
state
on
which
cuba
was
relying
was
this
repudiation
of
the
asserted
obligation.
if
i
may
read
from
its
brief
in
opposition
to
our
petition
for
to
certiori,
cuba
said,
but
here,
the
republic
of
cuba
is
a
party
to
the
suit.
for
seven
long
years,
it
has
been
asserting
that
its
repudiation
of
the
debt
was
its
act
of
state.
that
assertion
was
made
in
the
district
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
now
being
made
in
this
court.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
absolutely
your
honor,
absolutely,
now
contrast
that
with
the
position
that
cuba
took
in
the
brief-on
re-argument,
in
which
cuba
now
says,
we
do
not
agree
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
does
not
apply
to
commercial
transaction
but
find
no
need
to
argue
the
point
here.
it
is
of
course
absurd
to
characterize
this
as
an
ordinary
commercial
controversy.
it
arouse
not
out
of
normal
international
trade
but
out
of
an
intervention
and
it
is
the
intervention,
which
is
the
act
of
state,
not
the
repudiation
of
a
commercial
debt.
we
are
faced
with
another
threshold
difficulty
here
in
analyzing
just
what
it
is
that
cuba
says
it
is
the
act
of
state.
there
was
of
course
no
proof
of
anything
at
the
trial,
other
than
the
fact
that
a
decree
has
been
entered.
with
respect
to
the
decree
itself,
there
are
some
very
difficult
issues
presented
by
cuba’s
present
position.
that
is
the
decree,
now
somehow
constitutes
the
act
of
state.
the
theory
of
that
of
course
is
that
the
decree,
having
nationalized
the
accounts
receivable
of
the
owners
somehow
operated
to
give
the
claim
of
right
to
cuba’s
appropriation
of
the
funds
as
they
arrived
in
cuba.
the
difficulty
is
that
to
deal
with
that
issue,
i
do
not
believe
that
proper
parties
are
before
the
court.
in
that
effect
of
dealing
with
reversing
the
lower
court's
conclusions
on
that
issue
would
be
to
adversely
affect
the
rights
of
the
owners.
they
are
the
real
parties
in
interest.
dunhill
in
fact
has
no
real
stake
in
that
because
if
the
accounts
receivable
were
appropriated
by
cuba
in
act
of
state,
that
would
be
recognized
by
united
states
courts.
we
paid
the
right
people.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
if
sabbatino
were
followed
and
that
ruling
and
that
version
of
the
sabbatino
case
were
to
be
followed,
i
guess
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
yes
we
would
your
honor
but
i
do
not
think
we
would
even
necessarily
reach
that
question
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
because
in
our
view,
sabbatino
should
not
apply
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
should
not
apply
to
sovereign's
repudiation
of
a
debt
incurred
in
the
course
of
a
commercial
transaction.
so
that
one
does
not
even
reach
the
question
whether
such
a
repudiation
is
a
violation
of
international
law.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
one
can
analyze
it
in
one
of
two
ways
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
one
can
either
say
that
is
not
an
act
of
state
or
one
can
say
although
it
maybe
an
act
of
state,
such
an
act
of
state
will
not
be
given
recognition
as
a
defense
by
the
sovereign
who
is
committing
the
act
of
state
to
its
commercial
obligation.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
yes,
absolutely.
if
i
may
follow
that
for
a
minute,
there
may
be
a
situation
and
this
is
getting
very
theoretical
where
if
the
repudiation
appears
to
be
something
considerably
different
from
the
repudiation
but
has
the
effect
of
repudiating
commercial
obligation.
if
that
act
itself
is
in
clear
violation
of
international
law,
we
might
also
say,
i
think
we
would
also
take
the
position
that
that
should
not
be
recognized
by
the
states’
courts
but
we
do
not
need
to
reach
that
in
this
case
at
all.
our
theory
of
how
sabbatino
should
be
read
to
deal
with
the
repudiation
of
commercial
obligations.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
a
minute
to
mr.
justice
steven's
question
regarding
the
last
known
position
at
least
of
cuba
with
respect
to
what
the
act
of
state
is.
cuba
now
appears
to
take
the
position
in
its
reply
to
the
government's
amicus
brief,
that
neither
the
act
of
state,
neither
the
decree
itself,
nor
the
later
repudiation
but
somehow
a
seizure
of
funds
as
they
arrived
in
cuba
perhaps
under
the
authority
of
the
original
intervention
decree.
our
response
to
that
is
that
that
factual
assertion
is
so
contrary
to
the
factual
position
taken
by
cuba
in
the
courts
below
during
the
course
of
this
litigation
that
it
should
be
rejected
out
of
hand.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
i
do
not
believe
that
to
be
correct
sir.
i
believe
that
their
basic
position
there
which
was
set
forth
on
pages
three
and
four
of
their
brief
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
well,
it
says
that
seven
long
years
that
it
has
been
asserting
that
its
repudiation
of
the
debt
was
its
act
of
state.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
the
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
of
certiori,
that
is
correct.
i
thought
that
is
what
you
are
referring
to.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
actually
your
honor,
reading
on,
then
says
and
in
any
event
the
act
of
state
doctrine
was
a
complete
defense.
those
were
all
the
alternative
arguments.
the
first
argument
was,
that
the
act
of
state
viz-a-viz,
the
owners,
was
to
take
their
accounts
receivable
and
therefore
they
were
entitled,
you
do
not
even
reach
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
they
were
therefore
entitled
to
these
payments
as
they
came
in.
that
was
not
the
act
of
state
against
dunhill,
the
act
of
state
against
dunhill
was
the
repudiation.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
i
think
there
is
an
enormous
difference
your
honor
because
the
nationalization
of
the
accounts
receivable
is
the
nationalization
of
a
cuban
asset.
one
that
does
not
even
raise
the
issue
of
the
act
of
state,
nor
one
that
affects
the
rights
of
american
citizens,
when
you
talk
about
nationalizing
payments,
that
is
a
very
different
question
because
those
payments
were
payments
of
dunhill
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
well,
if
the
prior
nationalization
was
effective
to
nationalize
the
accounts
receivable.
the
courts
below
both
have
held
that
not
to
be
so
for
purposes
of
american
law
because
the
accounts
receivable
were
held
by
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
republic
of
iraq
case
to
have
a
situs
in
the
united
states
and
therefore
not
subject
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
well,
that
is
a
different
issue
there
your
honor
because
we
start
with
the
premise
now
from
the
rulings
of
the
courts
below
that
the
accounts
receivable
were
not
nationalized.
so
that
if
the
payments,
if
it
is
now
cuba’s
position
that
is
was
the
payments
that
were
nationalized
as
they
went
down
by
some
affirmative
act
of
the
sovereign.
my
response
is
somewhat
different.
my
response
there
is
that
that
so
contradicts
the
factual
condition
that
cuba
took
through
15
years
of
litigation
in
our
courts
that
they
should
not
be
heard
to
urge
at
this
point.
must
we
recall
that
in
1961,
shortly
after
these
alleged
seizures
took
place,
cuba
came
into
our
courts
and
sought
to
recover
them?
later
on,
in
the
palicio
v.
brush
&
bloch,
litigation,
when
they
thought
that
the
payments
were
insignificant,
they
gave
up
their
right
to
them.
then
in
our
litigation,
when
it
developed
again
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
no
your
honor
and
that
is
not
my
point.
i
am
not
arguing
whether
that
stipulation
is
effective
or
not.
i
am
simply
saying,
when
it
later
developed
in
our
case
that
the
amounts
were
substantial,
they
reasserted
their
right
to
the
money.
when
it
turned
out
that
not
only
had
those
been
paid
but
the
court
found
that
they
had
received
them
over
their
vigorous
opposition;
they
still
maintained
that
they
were
entitled
to
the
money
and
that
they
had
not
received
them.
they
maintained
that
as
late
as
the
court
of
appeals.
how
can
cuba
now
come
in
and
say
with
that
history
of
15
years
of
denying
that
they
ever
received
the
money
and
claiming
that
they
wanted
it,
to
know
say,
wait
a
minute,
at
the
very
beginning
of
all
this,
we
forgot
to
tell
you,
we
really
took
this
money
in
the
first
instance.
in
our
view,
that
claim
of
the
factual
basis
for
the
act
of
state
makes
that
all
of
the
proceedings
that
went
on
below
a
charade.
for
the
reasons
i
have
stated,
we
conclude
that
the
sabbatino
issue
that
is
now
framed
by
the
court
need
be
reached
only
if
the
court
concludes
as
did
the
court
of
appeals,
that
counsel
statements
were
sufficient
to
evidence
the
act
of
state
and
that
act
of
state
was
the
repudiation
by
cuba
of
its
obligations
to
dunhill.
once
past
that
threshold
issue,
we
believe
that
sabbatino
should
be
reconsidered
as
i
have
indicated
and
the
act
of
state
doctrine
should
not
be
available
as
a
defense
to
a
sovereign
in
the
effort
to
repudiate
its
commercial
obligations.
we
begin
from
the
premise
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
a
doctrine
of
judicial
abstention.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
i
think
we
are
your
honor,
yes
we
are.
there
maybe
differences
in
phraseology
but
i
think
we
come
out
fairly
close
and
for
fairly
much
the
same
reasons.
indeed
having
argued
at
lengths
in
our
briefs
that
we
did
not
believe
that
the
executive
branch
could
be
embarrassed
by
such
a
ruling.
and
that
there
would
be
no
interference
with
our
foreign
relations,
or
separation
of
powers
problems
created
by
that,
we
obviously
gratify
that
the
executive
branch
in
its
views
concurs.
i
think
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
defer
my
argument
of
that
subject
in
view
of
the
time
element
to
government
counsel.
i
would
like
with
the
court's
permission
to
stress
a
slightly
different
approach
to
the
problem.
based
on
our
own
experiences,
counsel
to
clients
engaged
in
considerable
volume
of
international
trade.
the
government
obviously
has
a
far
greater
expertise
in
dealing
with
the
foreign
relations
aspects.
perhaps
the
private
counsel
can
add
something
to
the
issue.
obviously,
trade
is
conducted
today
with
a
variety
of
entities
overseas.
sometimes
obviously
private
entities
and
some
instances
governmental,
some
instances
some
mixture
which
maybe
analogous
to
some
of
our
form,
sometimes
not.
as
a
commercial
lawyer,
i
start
with
the
premise
that
the
law
ought
to
reflect
in
dealing
with
commercial
problems
as
neatly
as
possible.
the
expectations
of
the
parties
to
commercial
transactions,
those
expectations
i
can
assure
the
court,
do
not
vary
depending
on
whether
the
party
on
the
other
side
of
the
transaction
is
an
agency
of
a
foreign
government,
is
a
private
trader
or
is
some
combination
of
the
two.
indeed,
in
many
instances
with
the
numerous
forms
that
now
exists
in
the
commercial
world,
it
is
difficult
to
know
and
indeed
one
may
never
know
precisely
what
the
form
of
the
other
entity
is.
there
are
types
of
trading
companies
throughout
the
world
that
have
no
analogue
in
our
system.
there
maybe
some
government
ownership,
there
maybe
some
private
ownership.
the
interest
to
be
served
may
never
be
fully
be
known
by
the
other
party
of
the
transaction
but
in
entering
into
agreements
with
those
entities
as
well
as
with
the
state
trading
companies
or
with
private
traders.
the
expectations
of
the
parties
do
not
vary.
the
considerations
do
not
vary,
there
is
as
much
difference
in
dealing
from
one
government
to
another
government,
as
there
is
between
a
large
company
and
a
small
company,
as
between
one
country
and
another
country,
differences
vary
by
all
of
these
considerations.
i
am
saying
that
there
is
no
reason
for
making
any
distinction
in
my
view
between
the
obligations
and
the
rights
of
parties
dealing
with
foreign
sovereigns
in
the
commercial
context
as
opposed
to
when
they
deal
with
private
traders.
i
can
not
argue
with
cuba,
when
cuba
says
the
government
agencies
will
not
likely
repudiate
their
commercial
transactions.
i
take
that
to
be
a
given,
particularly
countries
which
engage
in
state
trading
on
a
large
scale,
have
a
vital
interest
in
protecting
their
reputation
in
the
international
community
but
the
same
is
true
of
the
private
trader
in
the
international
community.
indeed,
in
international
trade,
perhaps
more
so
even
in
domestic
trade
because
of
the
smaller
opportunity
for
face
to
face
contact.
trading
reputations
are
particularly
important
but
i
suggest
that
those
do
not
vary.
the
importances
of
that
do
not
vary
depending
on
whether
one
is
dealing
with
a
state
trading
agency
or
with
a
significant
private
trading
agency.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
should
like
to
reserve
my
last
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
yes
if
i
may
your
honor.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
start
by
picking
up
mr.
justice
white’s
comments.
the
reason
that
nobody
in
the
courts
below
ever
took
up
cuba
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
had
been
some
violation
of
international
law
was
very
simply
that
in
our
view,
in
the
other
parties
of
the
case,
no
act
of
state
was
ever
shown
in
the
courts
below.
the
only
thing
that
we
had
on
the
record
that
was
ever
asserted
as
an
act
of
state
against
the
importers
were
statements
by
counsel
talking
of
the
repudiation
that
cuba
would
not
pay
back
to
the
importers,
any
judgments
entered
against
it.
there
was
no
act
of
state
at
that
time
asserted
against
the
importers.
there
was
nothing
to
which
anyone
could
point
and
say
that
is
a
violation
of
international
law.
the
first
time
an
act
of
state
was
defined
really
in
this
case
was
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
there
for
the
first
time,
the
suggestion
was
that
it
was
the
repudiation
of
the
claim
of
the
unjust
enrichment
claim
of
dunhill
that
cuba
had
evidenced
through
statements
of
counsel
at
the
trial.
that
we
suggest,
if
the
issue
need
be
reached
can
constitute
a
violation
of
international
law.
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
discriminatory
taking
of
property
belonging
to
dunhill
which
erroneously
found
its
way
to
cuba.
now,
if
that
property
were
the
property
of
the
owners
rather
than
of
dunhill,
as
counsel
for
cuba
maintains,
then
the
decree
should
have
said,
cuba
owes
that
money
back
to
the
owners,
not
the
past
that
puts
through
with
dunhill
in
the
untenable
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
has
done.
let
me
return
now
again
to
the
issue
that
i
still
consider
critical
and
that
is
just
precisely
what
the
act
of
state
was
in
this
case?
i
now
gather
that
cuba’s
position
is
that
the
act
of
state
was
in
fact
the
decree
that
everything
that
flowed,
whether
it
was
a
taking
of
the
money
as
it
reached
cuba
or
whether
it
was
a
subsequent
repudiation
of
the
obligation,
all
of
that
arose
from
that
somehow,
ephemerally
out
of
the
original
decree
which
seized
the
accounts
but
dunhill
is
put
in
an
absolutely
untenable
position
by
that
reasoning.
the
courts
below
have
held
that
the
decree
was
ineffective
to
seize
the
accounts
and
that
therefore,
when
dunhill
paid
the
money
to
cuba,
it
was
paying
the
wrong
party.
that
is
precisely
what
has
put
dunhill
in
the
position
that
it
now
finds
itself.
i
suggest
that
for
the
court
to
find,
that
somehow
on
the
act
of
state
was
the
decree
itself
and
charged
dunhill
with
that
as
a
valid
act
of
state
unrelated
to
a
commercial
transaction,
is
to
fly
in
the
face
of
the
key
holdings
of
the
courts
below
and
not
deal
with
all
of
the
issues
that
are
presented
in
the
case.
if
the
court
is
to
get
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
that
decree
was
the
act
of
state,
i
see
no
way
it
can
do
it
without
granting
or
dealing
at
least
with
the
other
petitions
for
certiori
and
that
includes
both
cuba’s
cross
petition
as
well
as
the
conditional
cross
petition
of
the
importers.
i
would
like
to
talk
just
for
a
minute
about
the
comments
that
counsel
for
cuba
has
made
on
the
difference
between
the
act
of
state
and
sovereign
immunity
and
why
is
it
inappropriate
to
apply
the
principles,
one
doctrine
into
the
other.
we
suggested
in
our
brief
and
we
submit
now
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
sovereign
who
was
acting
in
a
commercial
context,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
can
interpose
sovereign
immunity
defense
or
act
of
state
defense
because
it
wants
to
repudiate
that
obligation
has
no
difference.
i
think
this
case
illustrates
it
well,
other
cases
certainly
same
is
true.
the
question
here
is
not
whether
an
act
of
state
is
valid.
the
only
question
here
is
whether
the
act
of
state
asserted
can
be
used
as
a
defense
to
justify
a
repudiation
of
otherwise
commercial
transaction.
i
would
like
also
to
comment
on
the
inability
that
the
counsel
for
cuba
finds
to
make
the
distinction
between
the
commercial
and
the
political
transaction
which
we
have
suggested
in
somewhat
different
terms
in
our
argument.
the
fact
that
there
are
maybe
difficult
cases
such
as
shoes
for
the
military
does
not
mean
that
the
basic
distinction
between
the
commercial
and
political
transactions
can
not
be
made.
obviously,
in
this
case,
nobody
would
suggest
that
the
purchase
and
sales
of
cigars
was
anything
other
than
in
a
normal
commercial
transaction.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
i
would
concede
that
that
was
a
political
transaction.
by
the
same
token,
there
are
obviously
easy
cases
on
the
other
side
where
nobody
would
argue,
that
the
act
of
the
foreign
state
was
clearly
a
political
act
unrelated
to
its
commercial
activities
but
with
the
volume
of
normal
commercial
activities
being
carried
on
by
state
trading
agencies
throughout
the
world
today,
it
is
foully
to
suggest
that
in
most
cases,
one
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
say
that
this
is
a
commercial
transaction
and
should
be
treated,
and
the
sovereign
should
be
treated
as
though
it
is
a
party
to
a
commercial
transaction.
not
a
sovereign
exercising
some
kind
of
sovereign
rights.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
let
me
comment
on
that,
counsel
for
cuba
has
suggested
that
we
have
perhaps
abandoned
the
second
argument
on
which
we
relied
in
the
first
instance.
that
is
not
so,
i
simply
did
not
want
to
repeat
our
position
in
that
regard
and
that
you
will
recall
deals
with
the
questions
of
whether
given
the
nature
of
these
cases
against
the
importers
that
they
all
can
be
treated
as
one
for
purposes
of
pool,
and
that
would
be
one
way
and
there
maybe
other
ways
--
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
that
is
right.
in
that
sense,
it
falls
within
the
national
city
bank
if
you
treat
this
whole
case
as
a
pool
because
on
balance
there
is
more
money
going
from
the
importers
as
a
group
to
the
cubans
in
other
ways.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
no,
it
has
not.
mr.
victor
s.
friedman
in
that
event
your
honor,
i
would
still
hold
that
the
act
is
commercial
because
to
the
extent
that
cuba
were
to
say
that
it
was
retaining
payments
made
in
the
normal
commercial
sense.
i
do
not
see
any
difference
between
the
retention
of
payments
or
even
if
it
were
a
decree
saying
we
seize
the
payments.
if
that
arises
out
of
a
course
of
commercial
dealings,
i
see
no
difference.
let
me
give
a
different
example
if
i
may.
let
us
suppose
that
a
transaction
were
an
import
transaction,
where
goods
were
going
down
to
cuba.
it
seems
to
me
it
makes
no
difference
at
that
point,
whether
the
foreign
government
says
we
refuse
to
pay
for
the
goods
or
we
seize
the
goods.
it
is
the
same
repudiation
of
a
commercial
transaction.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
mr.
justice.
