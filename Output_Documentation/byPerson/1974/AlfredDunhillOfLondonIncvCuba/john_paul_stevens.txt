justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
are
in
control
of
the
freezing
mechanism,
i
suppose
that's
right,
but
you're
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
respect
to
dunhill?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
their
holding
was
not
based
on
the
notion
that
cuba
has
nationalized
and
accounts
receivable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
that
you
are
right,
that
there
was
no
act
of
state
such
as
the
court
of
appeals
described,
then
you
say
that
the
barrier
would
be
removed
to
your
having
a
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
questions
on
sovereign
immunity
or
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
cuba
ever
acknowledged
an
obligation
to
repay
the
importers?
are
you
contending
they
repudiated
an
obligation
they
never
acknowledged
to
exist
that
is
what
i
am
really
asking?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
not
understand
them
to
be
contending
that
they
repudiated
an
existing
obligation
but
rather
that
their
act
of
state
was
to
in
a
fact
to
appropriate
the
property
of
your
clientsâ€™
when
it
was
in
cuba
namely
the
cash,
when
was
paid
on
account?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
question.
suppose
we
disagreed
with
you,
and
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
if
there
was
an
act
of
state
and
the
repudiation
and
that
the
ruling
of
sabbatino
was
therefore
to
be
contended
with,
that
would
bar
the
any
consideration
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
international
law
justice
john
paul
stevens
assume
that
sabbatino
were
not
followed,
would
you
claim
there
was
a
violation
of
international
law
in
the
repudiation
of
cuba
of
this
debt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
i
understand
that,
it
should
not
apply
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you
said
that
only
if
whether
or
not
it
violates
international
law,
you
have
another
reason
for
saying
the
act
of
state
would
not
file
recovery
