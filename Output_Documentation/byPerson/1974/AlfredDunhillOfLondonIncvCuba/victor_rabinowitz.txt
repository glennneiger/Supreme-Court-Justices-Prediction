mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
page
on
which
the
quote
from
the
court
of
appeals
that
i
read
is
on
25
(a)
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
mr.
chief
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
start
off
if
i
may
with
this
discussion
that
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
had
been
having
because
i
suggested
in
filing
my
brief
here
that
this
petition
for
certiorari
was
improvidently
granted
and
should
be
dismissed.
then
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
urge
was
that
no
judgment
can
be
collected
here,
collected
that
can
perhaps
be
obtain
if
the
petition
to
wins,
but
no
judgment
can
be
collected
here
under
any
foreseeable
circumstances,
and
therefore
this
case,
well
i'm
not
moot
in
the
constitutional
sense,
that
is
a
risk
of
a
case
of
controversy
under
article
iii.
nevertheless,
it
is
for
all
practical
purposes
pointless.
and
it
is
pointless
because
all
cuban
assets
are
frozen,
and
the
treasury
department
which
has
the
task
of
licensing
the
expenditure
of
funds
out
of
frozen
funds
has
indicated
already
as
we
knew
all
along
it
would
that
it
will
not
license.
the
execution
of
any
dunhill
excess
judgment
against
assets
which
are
of
a
wise
frozen
whether
it
be
a
bank
account
as
mr.
justice
white
suggest
or
one
of
the
other
judgments
that
has
been
obtained
as
against
faver,
coe
as
mr.
friedman
suggests.
therefore,
we
have
a
situation
which
is
akin
shall
we
say
to
an
action
in
which
plaintiff
is
suing
a
person
who
is
concededly
and
obviously
insolvent.
the
total
number
of
claims
filed
against
cuban
assets
in
the
united
states
amounts
to
$1,799,000,000.00.
now,
i
don't
know
the
amount
of
frozen
funds
are,
but
if
they
amount
to
a
few
million
dollars,
it's
a
lot.
if
this
$53,000.00
judgment
is
collected
from
those
funds
and
i
don't
believe
it
can
be,
but
if
it
is
collected
from
those
funds,
we
have
pennies
depending
on
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
and
i
don't
believe
it
can
be
because
the
procedure
that
is
followed
in
all
of
these
cases
and
that
has
been
followed
in
the
cuba
case
is
to
require
a
debted
to
file
a
claim
with
the
foreign
claims
settlement
commission,
and
not
to
bring
the
lawsuit.
dunhill
chose
to
bring
a
lawsuit
instead
of
filing
a
claim.
now,
i
suppose
it
has
the
right
to
do
that.
but
if
passed
precedent
in
handling
these
cases
is
any
guide
to
what
the
future
may
bring,
and
of
course,
i
have
no
crystal
ball,
but
i
can
read
what
has
happened,
there
is
no
possibility
of
even
this
$53,000.00
sharing
in
that
$1
billion,
excuse
me,
$1,000,800,000.00
claim.
so,
this
whole
discussion,
although
it
involved
very
interesting
questions
of
law,
so
far
as
return
to
dunhill
is
concern
is
going
to
end
in
zero
when
i
cannot
understand
any
justification
for
dunhill
spending
all
his
time
and
i
of
course
why
the
court
granted
the
petition
for
cert
is
not
my
business,
but
at
least
i
suggest
that
perhaps
that
question
might
be
reviewed.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
so
far
as
the
face
to
face
set
off
is
concerned,
it
is
my
understanding
that
that
will
be
recognized
by
foreign
assets
control.
so
to
that
extent,
the
face
to
face
set
off
which
of
course
is
not
subject
on,
would
not
the
subject
of
this
petition
for
cert.
it
is
the
subject
of
another
petition
for
certiorari
which
cuba's
filed.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
no.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
as
far
as
i
know
now,
it
would
not.
i
don't
know
that
what
the
attitude
of
foreign
assets
control
would
be
on
that
subject,
but
i'm
been
trying
to
think
that
a
face
to
face
set
off
would
be
recognized
by
the
treasury
department.
now
on
the
question
of
is
there
an
act
of
state
here?
i
don't
know
whether
i
or
to
be
flattered
or
the
contrary
that
being
suggested
that
is
have
the
power
to
commit
an
act
of
state.
i
have
no
such
power,
and
then
no
statement
that
i
ever
made
in
court
is
to
be
considered
to
be
an
act
of
state.
cuba
here
received
funds
and
claims
that
it
was
entitle
to
those
funds.
hence,
it
refuses
to
return
the
money
and
it
is
retained
to
counsel
to
plead
its
right
to
those
funds
and
that's
what
counsel
has
been
doing
to
the
best
of
its
ability.
now,
that
claim
is
not
a
frivolous
or
capricious
or
an
arbitrary
claim.
it
is
based
as
mr.
friedman
was
kind
enough
to
state
on
a
nationalization
decree,
a
decree
which
was
adopted
on
september
17,
1960
and
which
purported
to
nationalize
all
of
the
assets
of
cuban,
not
american
but
cuban
concerns
about
manufactured
tobaccos,
cigars
in
havana,
and
to
nationalize
not
only
the
physical
property
in
cuba,
but
also
the
accounts
receivable.
the
question
as
to
whether
this
nationalization
decree
extended
to
the
accounts
receivable
was
litigated.
we
lost
in
the
district
court.
we
lost
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
pursuant
to
instructions
specific
i
might
saying,
instructions
by
my
client,
i
have
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari,
which
is
one
of
those
issues
that's
pending
in
the
other
case.
and
the
issue
there
involves
or
revolves
around
this
rather
metaphysical
question,
what
is
the
situs
of
the
debt?
if
the
situs
of
the
debt
was
in
havana,
then,
it
was
nationalized.
if
the
situs
of
the
debt
was
in
new
york,
then,
it
was
not
nationalized.
that's
an
issue
which
is
not
before
us.
i
mentioned
that
only
to
show
that
the
claim
of
act
of
state
here
was
not
disconnected
or
irrelevant
to
the
nationalization
decree
because
if
the
nationalization
decree
did
in
fact
and
i'm
advised
that
under
cuban
law,
it
would
have.
if
that
nationalization
decree
did
in
fact
attached
or
nationalized
the
accounts
receivable,
then,
we
are
entitled,
cuba
is
entitled
to
the
funds
for
pre-intervention
cigars.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
the
set
off
would
be
cancelled.
we
got
the
money.
we
have
the
money.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
we
got
it
because
mr.
dunhill
over
here
paid
it
to
us.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
whole
problem
now
was
whether
we
have
to
pay
it
back.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh,
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh,
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
can
cuba
get
the
money
out?
oh
no,
no.
it
goes
into
that
frozen
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
no
question
about
that.
that's
true
of
all
of
this
cuba
litigation.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
was
after
the
seizure.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
was
after
the
seizure.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh,
yes.
all
during
the
months
of
august,
september,
october,
november,
december,
it
continued
to
send
money
down
to
cuba.
now,
why
it
did
it?
i'm
not
all
together
sure.
various
reasons
have
been
given
and
hadn't
been
proven
as
events
later
shown
with
the
advantages
of
hindsight.
it
would
have
stopped
when
the
nationalization
occurred,
it
would
have
said
had
it
had
sufficient
foresight.
we
don't
know
whose
entitled
to
this
money
and
therefore,
we're
not
going
to
pay
it
to
anybody.
but
it
didn't
do
that.
it
continued
to
send
the
money
down
to
cuba.
it
sets
and
i
will
assume
for
purposes
of
this
argument
that
that's
exactly
what
happened
because
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
all
pre-intervention
and
a
little
bit
of
post-intervention.
i
think
perhaps
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
but
there
is
no
issue
about
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
court
held
that
the
former
owners
are
entitle
to
a
set
off,
are
entitle
to
a
judgment
against
cuba
which
is
a
set
off,
they're
very
complicated.
the
court
held
that
the
former
owners
were
entitled
to
that
money.
they
are
entitled
to
that
money
from
dunhill
which
was
the
debtor.
and
therefore,
dunhill
is
ordered
to
pay
that
money
to
the
former
owners.
dunhill
however
paid
the
money
to
cuba
said
the
court
by
mistake.
therefore,
it
is
entitled
to
get
that
precise
sum
back
from
us.
so
whatever
it
has
to
pay
the
former
owners,
it
collects
from
us,
except
for
this
$53,000.00
because
we
contend
there
is
no
way
in
which
it
can
collect
an
affirmative
judgment
of
$53,000.00
from
cuba.
i'm
feeling
a
little
bad,
i
keep
saying
us
in
here
because
it
may
give
the
court
some
idea
that
i
am
the
state,
but
i
am
not.
i
am
just
speaking
as
counsel.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
now,
counsel
has
made
much
in
his
brief,
and
again
in
his
oral
argument
to
the
contention,
to
the
argument
which
said
that
cuba
never
admitted
receiving
the
funds.
now
of
course,
that's
not
so,
what
happened
was
that
the
claim
was
made
at
large
sums
of
money
had
been
paid.
this
claim
did
not
come
to
like
until
1967
which
was
some
seven
years
after
nationalization.
by
that
time,
the
--
all
of
the
relevant
records
had
been
lost,
destroyed,
at
least
they
were
not
available.
and
so,
the
republic
of
cuba
said
in
response
to
a
set
of
interrogatories,
we
do
not
know
as
to
$93,000.00
of
the
total,
yes.
we
received
it,
as
--
because
they
were
records.
they
were
endorsed
checks.
as
to
the
balance,
we
do
not
know
whether
we
received
it
or
not.
the
district
court
held
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
that
we
had
received
it.
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
evidence
was
sufficient
that
we
had
received
it.
we're
not
applying
for
cert
on
that
issue
and
therefore,
i
will
assume
that
of
for
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
we
have
received
it.
now
of
course,
if
we
didn't
receive
it,
then
dunhill
has
no
claim
at
all.
dunhill's
whole
claim
here
is
based
on
the
fact
that
it
paid
money
to
us
by
mistake.
if
it
--
if
we
didn't
pay
it,
then
the
whole
of
dunhill's
claim
for
and
therefore,
we
really
think
the
petitioner
is
faced
with
the
fact
that
whatever
maybe
ultimate
truth,
so
far
as
to
the
record
is
concerned,
cuba
got
the
money.
and
also
it
is
clear
that
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
cuba,
basing
its
argument
on
a
nationalization
decree
says
it
does
not
have
to
repay
the
money,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
an
act
of
state
because
as
has
been
conceded,
no
particular
formality
is
required.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
cuba
got
the
money
in
september
of
1960,
september
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
bridging
the
nationalization;
some
of
it
before
the
nationalization,
some
of
it
after
the
nationalization.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
went
to
cuba.
oh,
by
that
time,
money
was
being
--
at
that
time,
money
was
being
shipped
to
cuba.
the
freeze
didn't
come
‘till
1963.
up
to
that
point,
the
money
went
down
to
cuba.
now,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
all
of
the
cases
that
the
court
--
that
a
course
of
conduct
is
sufficient
to
constitute
an
act
of
state.
we
have
a
great
deal
of
state
action
here,
much
more
than
henrico,
cochin,
bernstein
and
the
other
traditional
act
of
state
cases.
and
as
i've
indicated
this
continuing
interest
and
continuing
determination
by
cuba
to
assert
this
claim
is
an
indication
on
the
part
of
cuba
that
it
believes
that
under
its
own
nationalization
decree
in
its
own
view
of
the
law,
it
is
entitled
to
this
money.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
right.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
right,
right.
well
of
two
reasons.
that's
one.
the
other
is
that
at
least
so
far
as
the
president
of
the
soviet
union,
bulgaria,
romania,
yugoslavia,
and
two
or
three
other
similarly
situated
countries,
people
who
didn't
file
claims
with
the
foreign
claims
settlement
commission
don't
even
get
those
pennies.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh,
yes,
cut-off
date
was
two
or
three
years
ago.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no.
no,
the
claim
could
not
be
based
on
judgment
why
they
didn't
file
before
the
foreign
claims
settlement
commission,
i
don't
know.
but
there
certainly
is
not
the
slightest
precedent,
nor
for
there
be
the
slightest
justification
for
saying
that
a
litigant
who
ignored
the
statutory
procedure
set
up
by
congress
should
find
himself
placed
in
a
better
position,
so
far
as
ultimately
collecting
this
judgment
against
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yeah,
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
they
didn't
--
it's
useless
for
two
reasons
your
honor.
the
first
place,
they
didn't
file.
second
place,
even
if
they
had
filed,
the
amount
--
if
they
had
filed,
they
wouldn't
need
a
judgment.
but
even
if
they
had
filed,
the
amount
involved
would
have
been
infinitesimal
compared
to
the
amount
--
but
even
--
i
don't
know
what
disposition
is
going
to
be
made
to
that.
all
i
can
say
it
that
the
precedent
follow
in
all
of
the
other
cases
was
to
say
specifically
the
judgments
will
not
be
permitted,
and
that
claims
before
the
filed
with
the
foreign
claims
settlement
commission
are
the
only
source
of
getting
money.
and
remember,
so
far
as
the
settlements
in
the
past
have
been
concern,
the
issue
becomes
is
really
a
dual
one,
one
is
between
the
united
states
and
the
foreign
country,
and
that
settles
some
which
money
as
to
be
paid.
the
second
step
is
that
the
united
states
distributes
this
money
to
its
citizens.
and
in
the
treaties
that
have
been
entered
into
which
romania
and
the
other
countries
that
i've
mentioned,
the
united
states
has
specifically
waived
on
behalf
of
its
citizens
all
judgments
which
the
citizen
may
have
obtained
or
may
in
the
future
obtain
against
the
foreign
government
for
those
pre-settlement
claims
shall
we
say,
so
that
when
was
i
say
i
can't
even
venture
to
predict
what's
going
to
happened
here
if
the
polish
and
romanian
and
other
settlements
are
reached
here,
the
judgment
is
really
of
absolutely
no
value
in
this
situation.
and
what
we're
discussing
here
very
interesting
act
--and
to
me
rather
vital
questions
of
law,
and
i'm
always
delighted
to
discuss
them.
but
in
terms
of
the
practical
effect
of
what
we're
getting
here,
it's
going
to
turn
out
to
be
nothing
at
all.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
cuba
is
defending
it
right
now
because
this
court
issued
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
told
me
to
come
here
and
since
i
always
enjoy
arguing
before
this
court,
here
i
am.
but
cuba
is
proceeding
with
all
of
the
other
litigation
because
as
i
said
before,
my
clients
apparently
and
nobody
has
told
me
this,
but
i
can
grow
a
reasonable
inference.
my
client
feels
that
it
will
be
good
to
have
this
money
in
that
frozen
account
as
against
someday
when
there
is
going
to
be
a
settlement.
and
the
more
money
there
is
in
that
frozen
account,
the
better
it's
going
to
be
for
my
client.
now
maybe,
it
will
be
better
for
everybody,
i
don't
know
but
it's
going
to
be
better
for
my
client.
to
put
in
other
way,
if
i
may,
i
don't
suppose
this
is
a
breach
of
professional
confidence
as
one
of
my
client
said
to
me,
is
it
better
to
have
a
million
dollars
in
that
fund
or
not
to
have
a
million
dollars
in
the
fund,
and
my
answer
was
would
it
be
better
to
have
a
million
dollars
in
the
fund.
i
don't
know
exactly
why
it's
better.
i
just
think
it's
better
to
have
that
much
money
in
the
fund
than
not
to
have
that
much
money
in
the
fund.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
pardon
me?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
case
is
moot
in
the
sense
that
the
amount
of
money
that
will
go
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
alright,
i
--
no.
i
don't
think
it's
moot
in
any
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
in
a
constitutional
sense,
it
certainly
a
case
of
controversy.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that's
right.
it's
--
as
i
think
in
my
brief,
i
said
is
a
practical
matter
its
moot,
and
maybe
i
shouldn't
have
used
the
word
moot.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
we
have
no
connection
with
the
freezing
mechanism
at
all,
quite
the
contrary.
we've
tried
to
break
it
on
the
few
occasions
without
any
success.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
hadn't
thought
of
that.
i
don't
know,
maybe
i
--
i
don't
know
how
the
french
courts
or
the
german
courts
or
the
english
courts
would
treat
the
matter
like
this
and
what,
i'm
sure
that
they
have
their
own
problem
so
far
as
foreign
relations
and
the
enforcement
of
the
judgment
obtained
under
these
circumstances.
i
don't
know.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
have
read
newspapers
stories
that
indicate
that
that
maybe
the
case.
i
just
don't
know.
i
--
anyhow,
to
conclude
this
part
of
is
there
an
act
of
state,
i
submit
that
we
have
here
as
much
evidence,
as
much
of
an
act.
i
don't
know
what
counsel
means
when
he
keeps
talking
about
a
public
act.
i
don't
know
what
exactly
a
public
act
is.
in
the
french
against
banco
nacional
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
the
act
involved
a
piece
of
paper
called
an
instruction
which
was
posted
on
the
bulletin
board
of
the
national
bank
or
the
currency
stabilization
for
a
board
in
cuba
and
that
was
regarded
as
an
act
of
state.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh,
something
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no
question
at
all,
but
sometimes
it
is.
but
sometimes,
it
is
the
expropriation
of
a
load
of
hides
as
in
ochin
or
of
load
of
silver
as
in
record.
the
seizure
of
these
commodities
by
an
army
in
the
field
and
the
--
this
has
been
held
to
be
an
act
of
state
by
as
i
say
the
classic
cases.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
you
mean
why
it
has
not
made
a
decree
written
in
a
piece
of
paper?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think,
i
think
that
the
opinion
of
the
cuban
government
is
that
the
nationalization
decree
is
quite
sufficient,
and
that
there
is
no
particular
point
in
repeating
over
and
over
again
that
it
claims
that
it
nationalized
these
account
receivable.
and
therefore,
it
is
entitled
to
that
money.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
1960,
yes
sir.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that's
right,
nationalized
everything.
and
i
suppose
that
there
is
no
--
the
government
does
not
feel
any
compulsion
to
keep
repeating
this
because
the
governments
are
not
always
--
to
issue
documents.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes.
that
is
part
of
the
debate
and
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh
no,
no.
that's
not
an
issue
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
exactly,
that
is
an
issue.
but
whether
that
seizure
is
valid
under
united
states
law,
the
seizure
of
accounts
receivable
i
mean,
is
valid
under
the
united
states
law
is
not
valid
under
united
states
law
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it's
an
act
of
state.
the
fact
is
it's
an
act
of
state.
now,
maybe
they
attempted
to
do
something
that
they
couldn't
do.
if
it
is
true
that
a
debt
has
its
situs
and
as
i
said
before,
it's
a
rather
metaphysical
problem
that
a
debt
has
it
situs
in
the
--
at
the
home
of
the
debtor,
then
this
was
an
ineffective
nationalization
decree
because
it
sought
to
nationalize
property
outside
the
territory.
but
in
the
cuban
view,
this
is
not
so,
and
i
have
as
i
say
so
argued
in
this
petition
for
certiorari
which
is
before
the
court
pending
at
this
moment.
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
second
question
which
is
the
so
called
counter
claim
rule.
as
your
honors
will
recall
in
sabbatino,
this
court
held
with
only
one
judge
dissenting,
that
the
court
of
the
united
states
would
not
examine
it
to
the
legality
of
the
conduct
of
a
sovereign
done
within
its
own
territory.
when
the
city
bank
came
before
three
years
ago,
the
court
had
before
it
a
claim
by
city
bank
first
that
there
was
or
should
be
a
counter
claim
exception
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
and
second,
the
court
had
before
it
a
letter
from
the
state
department,
and
that
state
department
said
that
the
act
of
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
how
much
time
do
i
have
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
thank
you
sir.
i
would
like
to
spend
my
remaining
time
on
the
problem
the
counter
claim
rule,
but
just
for
a
moment
before
i
get
to
that,
i
would
like
to
make
one
thing
clear
if
it's
not
already
clear.
while
i
said
that
the
nationalization
decree
of
september
1960,
nationalized
not
only
the
physical
property,
but
also
the
account
receivable,
and
therefore
the
problem
arose
as
to
where
these
accounts
receivable
were
located.
of
course,
it
is
true
that
shortly
after
in
the
two
or
three
months
after
the
nationalization
decree,
the
money
represented
by
these
accounts
receivable
did
in
fact
to
get
to
cuba.
so
that
it
was
no
longer
a
question
of
nationalizing
intangibles
which
will
located
in
a
foreign
country,
but
was
then
became
a
question
of
the
effect
of
the
nationalization
decree
on
that
money
which
was
then
in
cuba,
so
that
from
the
position
of
the
respondent
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
pardon
me?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
all
of
it
that
was
involved,
yes.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
all
of
it,
yes.
all
of
it
came
to
cuba
and
that's
why
cuba
is
under
an
obligation
to
pay
it
back.
and
of
course,
the
nationalization
decree
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
pre-intervention
payments.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes.
payment
for
pre-int
--
that's
right.
so
that
as
that
money
came
back,
it
was
the
--
put
down
there,
it
was
the
position
of
the
cuban
government
that
as
it
entered
cuba,
the
nationalization
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
long
after
three
years
later.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
three
years
later.
now
on
the
question
of
the
counter
claim
rule,
as
i
said
in
the
city
bank
case,
this
court
had
before
it
a
letter
from
the
state
department
which
said
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
in
its
opinion
was
not
to
be
applied
in
the
counter
claim
situation
and
i
quote
“the
amount
of
the
relief
to
be
granted
is
limited
to
the
amount
of
the
foreign
states
claim,
and
the
foreign
policy
interest
with
the
united
states
do
not
require
application
of
the
doctrine.”
the
letter
then
went
on
to
say
that
the
foreign
policy
interest
of
the
united
states
do
not
require
the
application
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
to
barge
adjudication
of
a
defendant's
claim
or
set-off
against
the
government
of
cuba
in
these
circumstances.
and
hence
the
act
of
state
doctrine
should
not
be
applied
in
this
or
like
cases.
now,
there
is
no
state
department
letter
here
of
course,
and
i
must
with
due
respect
your
honor
say
that
at
least
so
far
as
the
case
is
i
am
familiar
with,
the
state
department
has
never
sua
sponte
written
a
letter.
in
the
sabbatino
case,
the
state
department
participated
not
only
as
amicus
but
in
argument,
but
that
was
on
the
motion
of
the
court,
not
on
its
own
notion
or
not
by
its
own
request.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
they
did
sir.
yes,
they
did.
and
in
--
it's
quite
right.
and
in
the
city
bank
case,
it's
my
understanding
that
they
came
in
at
the
request
of
city
bank
or
at
least
at
the
suggestion
of
city
bank.
and
since
then
in
other
cases
which
are
pending
in
the
district
court,
in
one
case,
they
did
submit
a
letter.
in
other
cases,
they
have
refused
to
submit
letters
sir.
what
motivates
them
one
way
or
the
other,
i
don't
know.
the
most
recent
was
a
refusal
to
submit
three
letters
in
cases
involving
three
banks.
now,
the
petitioner's
argument
here
is
based
on
three
assumptions,
none
of
which
i
respectfully
submit
as
valid.
first,
that
there
was
a
ruling
by
this
court
in
the
city
bank
case
that
there
was
the
counter
claim
exception
to
the
sabbatino
rule.
second,
that
the
stevenson
letter
submitted
in
city
bank
is
applicable
to
this
case.
and
third,
that
there
is
an
exception
to
what
i
contend
is
a
non-existed
counter
claim
rule
which
would
permit
the
petitioner
to
get
an
affirmative
judgment
in
this
case.
now
as
your
honors,
i'm
sure
will
recall
the
city
bank
case,
there
was
only
one
opinion
out
of
mr.
justice
douglas
which
opted
for
a
straight
out
and
out
counter
claim
exception
to
the
sabbatino
case.
three
judges
thought
that
there
should
be
a
counter
claim
exception
when
there
was
a
state
department
letter
as
there
was
in
that
case.
five
judges
as
i
read
the
opinion
felt
that
there
should
not
be
a
counter
claim
exception
to
the
sabbatino
rule.
so,
it's
rather
difficult
to
say
and
talk
about
a
counter
claim
rule
in
the
national
city
bank
case
because
as
i
read
those
opinions,
the
vote
was
would
have
been
on
that
issue
four
to
five.
thank
you.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
your
honor,
i
hope
it
doesn't
because
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
your
lead
was
a
wrong
one.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
and
i'm
going
to
take
advantage
of
it
by
saying
that
i
think
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
as
an
exception
to
sabbatino.
and
i'm
going
to
take
advantage
of
it
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
by
suggesting
that
the
counter
claim
rule
is
improper
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
as
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out
in
the
dissent
in
city
bank,
all
the
reasons
for
the
sabbatino
case
are
equally
valid
with
respect
to
a
counter
claim.
and
the
second,
that
more
often
than
not,
the
question
of
whether
a
case
comes
up
as
a
counter
claim
or
as
an
affirmative
claim
depends
on
who
gets
to
the
court
house
first
because
in
all
of
these
cases,
it
could
have
operated
in
exactly
the
other
way
if
the
other
party
had
come
in
first.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
oh
yes,
yes
sir.
and
just,
may
i
say
in
final
conclusion
on
that,
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
dispose
of
this
matter
here
in
one
of
two
ways,
either
it
grant
those
other
two
petitions
that
are
pending,
and
that
we
really
go
at
this
rather
tangled
situation
and
decide
all
of
the
issues,
or
else
that
the
petition
be
dismiss
as
in
advertently
granted
because
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
pardon
me?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
this
is
dismissed,
i
would
think
that
the
others
ought
to
be
denied,
yes.
if
this
is
entertained,
i
think
the
others
ought
to
be
entertained
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
--
but
unless
your
honors
just
want
to
make
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
in
providently.
inadvert
--
no,
it
wasn't
in
advertent
your
honor.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no,
i'm
certain,
it
was
not
inadvertent.
i
misspoke.
i
think,
inadvertently
granted,
which
would
i
prefer?
well,
i
do
love
to
argue
the
cases
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes,
it
is
difficult.
i
love
to
argue
cases
before
this
court
and
the
prospect
of
another
go
around
that
this
very
attractive
to
me.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
but
still,
i
think
it
might
best
if
every
--
is
like,
we
like
the
court
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
i
would
just
like
you
to
be
of
either
affirmed,
i've
no
objection
to
an
affirmance.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
don't
know
that
it
matter
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
a
great
deal.
i
think
i
would
prefer
dismissal
to
an
affirmance.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
am
under
no
illusion
that
you're
giving
me
a
choice.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
am
glad
that
i
can
not
find
one
point
of
agreement
with
the
government
in
this
case.
in
the
assertion
that
the
sabbatino
case
is
not
involved
in
this
litigation,
i
agree
completely
with
that
statement.
i
think
that
my
analysis
is
different,
but
i
think
i
can
agree
that
the
issue
of
the
sabbatino
case,
need
not
to
be
in
fact
as
i
understand
the
situation
can
not
be
reached
on
this
issue.
let
me
first
address
myself
to
what
has
been
the
principal
burden
of
the
petitioners’
argument.
namely,
was
there
an
act
of
state
by
the
government
of
cuba
and
what
was
it.
yes,
there
was
an
act
of
state
and
the
act
of
state
was
the
intervention
decree
of
september
16th
1960
and
everything
that
has
happened
since
that
time
has
been
based
on
that
intervention
decree.
of
course
it
was
not
a
single
act.
no
political
act
and
perhaps
no
human
act.
it
is
a
single
act
that
had
consequences
and
the
ultimate
consequences
are
that
it
resulted
in
a
refusal
to
honor,
an
obligation
which
the
district
court,
10
years
later
found
that
it
had
to
dunhill.
a
great
deal
has
been
said
in
this
case,
on
the
prior
argument
and
in
the
opinion
of
briefs
of
counsel
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court,
about
statements
of
counsel
that
the
act
of
state
here
consisted
only
of
statements
of
counsel.
since,
i
was
the
counsel,
i
have
felt
a
heavy
burden
here
to
justify
my
attempting
to
act
as
sovereign
and
passing
acts
of
state
and
so
i
looked
at
the
record
to
see
what
it
was
that
counsel
had
said
at
the
district
court
level.
i
find
in
closing
argument,
words
which
i
have
reproduced
in
a
footnote
to
the
brief
filed
in
response
in
reply
to
the
brief
of
the
united
states
as
a
amicus
curiae.
appears
at
the
bottom
of
page
five
of
that
brief,
it
is
the
last
of
the
many
briefs
that
have
been
filed
here.
i
am
reading
in
the
middle,
i
do
not
want
to
take
too
much
time
on
this.
under
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
the
cuban
government
in
accepting,
expropriating,
seizing,
and
nationalizing,
whatever
words
you
want,
to
take
this
money
has
done
so
pursuant
to
a
regulation,
a
law,
a
decree
of
the
government
of
cuba
and
therefore
the
courts
of
this
state
will
not
look
in
to
the
matter
nor
will
the
federal
court.
i
am
not
talking
about
the
extra
territorial
effect
of
an
act
of
state.
i
am
talking
about
a
territorial
effect,
namely
the
seizure
or
the
acceptance,
or
the
appropriation
of
this
money
when
it
got
down
to
cuba.
we
are
not
concerned
if
they
expropriated
debts
on
september
15th,
the
question
is
what
happened
on
october
1st
and
15th,
november
8th
and
december
12th
when
the
money
came
down?
at
that
time
the
cuban
government
took
this
money
and
under
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
it
belongs
to
the
cuban
government
and
the
decree
to
which
the
counsel
was
referring
in
that
case,
was
of
course
the
nationalization
decree
of
september
15,
1960.
not
to
any
other
act
of
state,
which
counsel
made
up
or
created
or
passed
in
the
course
of
his
argument.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
do
not
think
that
they
are
two
different
concepts
your
honor.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
do
think
that
they
are
different
formulations
at
least,
in
my
mind,
at
least
they
were
different
formulations
of
the
same
problem.
the
repudiation,
of
which
we
spoke
there,
was
not
a
naked
repudiation
of
a
commercial
debt.
it
was
not
a
repudiation
which
was
created
in
a
vacuum.
at
all
times,
it
has
been
clear
that
the
cuban
position
has
been
based
on
the
intervention
decree
of
1960
and
there
was
never
any
suggestion
that
there
was
any
subsequent
act.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well
i
do
not
know
whether
the
debt
existed
at
the
time
of
the
decree.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
debt
that
we
are
talking
about
as
a
result
of
the
rather
strange
way
which
this
case
has
developed,
the
debt
that
we
were
talking
about
i
suppose
perhaps
was
not
created.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
but
the
obligation,
the
debt
of
dunhill
was
not
created
until,pardon
me?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
debt,
i
would
say
did
not
exist
until
the
district
court
handed
down
its
opinion
in
1972.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
suppose
that
that
is
true
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well
perhaps
the
word
repudiation
was
an
unwise
one.
the
cuban
government
from
the
very
beginning
has
taken
the
position
that
this
money
belonged
to
it.
it
belonged
to
it
and
it
collected
the
money
in,
much
as
a
receiver
who
was
appointed
by
a
court
in
the
united
states
and
given
authority
to
take
over
the
property
and
the
assets
of
a
company
will
acquire
and
will
take
title
to
accounts
receivable
or
other
money
that
happened
to
come
in
to
his
possession
and
intervener
is
like
a
receiver,
except
that
it
is
executive
rather
than
a
judicial
officer.
the
functions
that
he
was
to
perform
under
the
intervention
decree,
were
precisely
to
take
in
to
his
possession
all
of
the
property
of
the
intervened
company.
now
when
that
money
came
down
into
cuba,
he
took
it.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
cuba
claimed
that
it
was
property
of
the
intervened
company.
of
course,
there
was
some
question
at
that
time
i
suppose
there
might
have
been
a
question.
was
this
property
of
the
intervened
company,
or
was
it
a
property
of
the
former
owners?
no
one
dreamed
at
that
point
that
it
would
turn
out
to
be
the
property
of
dunhill.
at
least
i
do
not
think
anybody
dreamed
of
it.
dunhill
did
not
even
make
a
claim
to
this
money
until
1969,
on
the
last
day
of
the
trial
of
the
district
court.
dunhill
came
in
and
amended
its
answer
to
claim
the
money,
it
had
not
even
claimed
it
up
to
that
time.
at
this
point,
it
became
apparent
as
a
result
of
what
developed
in
the
trial
that
a
possible
outcome
of
this
complex
set
of
affairs
would
be,
that
cuba
would
be
directed
to
pay
the
money
back
to
dunhill.
up
to
this
point,
it
had
never
even
demanded
it
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
certainly
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
was
our
position
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
exactly
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
do
not
think
that
that
was
what
we
claimed.
what
we
claimed
was,
we
did
not
owe
it
and
we
did
not
owe
it
because
it
was
an
act
of
state.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
made
what
i
considered
then
and
still
consider
to
be
an
alternative
argument
and
that
is
a
very
broad
argument
and
i
do
not
find
it
necessary
to
repeat
it
here
and
it
was
picked
up
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
was
accepted
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
maybe
the
reason
for
all
of
this
trouble
here
now.
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
very
broad
step,
very
broad
position.
and
as
i
read
the
opinion
and
incidentally
it
was
not
alone
in
so
doing.
it
followed
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
the
french
case,
quoted
from
it,
i
think
extensively.
it
took
the
position
at
that
time,
that
any
repudiation,
any
refusal
of
a
sovereign
to
pay
a
debt
was
an
act
of
state.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
would
defend
that
judgment
here
today
if
i
had
to.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
suppose
i
did.
i
would
do
it
today
and
i
think
that
it
was
a
sound
decision
but
i
do
not
believe
that
i
have
to
go
that
far.
i
do
not
think
i
have
nearly
that
far
because
i
think
that
we
have
here,
a
long
time
prior
to
that
position,
a
clear
unequivocal
act
of
state
which
has
resulted
to
cuba’s
contention
that
it
was
entitled
to
this
money
from
the
very
beginning,
it
was
claiming
the
money
as
a
result
of
the
intervention
decree
and
it
was
therefore
entitled
to
the
money
and
on
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
on
that
basis,
i
claim
that
they
should
not
have
been
any
set
off
and
that
issue
your
honor
is
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiori
which
is
up
to
this
point
at
least
refused
to
either
grant
or
denied.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
exactly
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
on
that
basis,
there
never
was
any
debt.
and
i
argued
that
in
my
petition
for
certiori
and
so
far
the
court
has
not
passed
upon
as
i
wish
it
would.
i
am
getting
a
little
tired
of
this
case.[laughing]
now,
i
think
that
that
is
of
importance
here
because
i
have
apparently
been
charged
with
having
as
i
say,
committed
an
act
of
state
and
it
is
not
a
sin
to
which
i
am
not
prepared
to
plead
guilty.
that
really
is
the
issue
that
i
see
in
this
case.
was
there
an
act
of
state?
the
answer
is
yes.
what
was
the
act
of
state?
here
it
was,
cuba
is
entitled
to
this
money
and
is
under
no
obligation
to
pay
it
back.
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
a
lot
of
other
money
as
well
but
that
can
await
this
petition
for
certiori.
remember
i
said
here
last
time
that
i
did
not
even
think
that
this
petition
for
certiori
should
not
even
granted.
i
thought
the
whole
thing
was
a
mistake.
the
court
obviously
did
not
see
it
my
way
or
i
would
not
be
here
now
and
so
i
am
not
stressing
that
point
at
this
time.
the
court
when
it
originally
granted
the
petition
for
certiori
in
the
first
time,
put
forth
a
second
question,
that
second
question
said,
assuming
an
act
of
state
may
petition
again
an
affirmative
judgment
on
its
counter
claim
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
i
am
not
reciting
the
full
language
of
it.
now,
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
that
here
unless
the
court
wants
me
to.
it
was
not
raised
at
all
by
respondent.
it
is
fully
discussed
in
the
briefs.
i
think
that
the
question
assumes
something
which
is
not
a
fact
namely,
that
this
court
in
the
national
city
bank
case
adopted
a
so
called
counter
claim
rule.
as
i
recall
the
situation,
there
are
only
four
judges.
only
one
judge
who
opted
for
a
clear
counter
claim
rule
and
that
was
mr.
justice
douglas.
three
judges
opted
for
a
counter
claim
rule
when
supported
by
the
state
department
letter
and
the
other
five
judges
voted
against
it
all
together.
so,
i
am
not
going
to
discuss
it
because
as
i
said,
i
think
that
counsel
has
not
urged
the
point
and
i
do
not
want
to
tilt
a
non-existent
argument
here.
the
order
for
re-argument
however,
and
the
governments
brief
here
do
raise
two
very
important
international
law
questions.
i
do
not
believe
either
of
them
is
raised
on
this
record
but
they
are
interesting.
i
think
it
is
a
mistake
for
a
court
to
decide
questions
just
because
they
are
interesting.
i
think
that
the
rule
that
a
court
should
decide
only
the
case
that
is
before
it
is
a
salutary
rule.
however,
interested
we
maybe
in
the
broader
questions
those
broader
questions
will
get
here
soon
enough,
back
in
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
we
are
going
to
be
here
with
them,
i
think
sometime
pretty
soon,
that
all
the
questions
about
the
national
city
bank
case
and
the
sabbatino
case
and
so
forth
will
be
here
and
sufficient
onto
the
day.
but
these
issues
were
raised
by
the
court
and
solicitor
general,
and
i
think
that
out
of
respect,
i
should
answer
them.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
may
i
please
the
court?
mr.
justice
white
did
you
have
a
question
on
your
mind
when
we
were
at
recess?
i
thought
you
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
was
just
about
to
get
to
it.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
there
has
been
some
confusion
here
about
the
sabbatino
decision
and
what
it
held.
the
sabbatino
case
did
not
create
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
all
that
the
sabbatino
case
did
was
to
say
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
was
not
a
defense
when
it
was
alleged
that
the
act
was
a
violation
of
international
law.
it
is
not
my
understanding
that
the
dissenting
opinion
of
the
sabbatino
case,
or
any
of
the
other
academicians
who
have
written
extensively
on
the
subject
of
the
sabbatino
case,
have
ever
urged
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
should
be
abolished,
or
the
act
of
state
doctrine
was
wrong
but
merely
that
the
sabbatino
decision
was
wrong
in
failing
to
allow
of
an
international
law
exception.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
is
right
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
yes
certainly
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
exactly
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
do
not
think
that
you
do
go
to
that
process.
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
go
to
that
process.
if
the
sabbatino
decision
holds,
then
the
answer
--
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
is
my
understanding.
now,
the
government
here
has
urged
the
position
which
i
think
that
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
sabbatino
but
it
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
it
is
urging
here,
for
the
first
time,
i
believe
in
our
history,
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
should
be
subject
to
a
limitation,
namely
that
it
does
not
apply
to
commercial
as
compared
with
political
transactions,
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
having
nothing
to
do
with
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
international
law,
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
solicitor
generals’
brief.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
what
the
solicitor
generals
representative
said
when
he
was
here.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
read
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
that
is
the
issue
that
is
interested
in.
it
is
not
interested
in
the
intervention
and
it
says
specifically
that
it
is
not
taking
any
position
on
cuba’s
contention
that
it
had
the
right
to
receive
and
retain
the
funds
on
the
basis
of
the
intervention
decree.
rather
it
assumes
that
we
have
here
what
it
refers
to
as
a
naked
repudiation
of
a
commercial
obligation
or
something
like
that
and
it
says
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
should
not
apply
to
that
kind
of
a
dispute.
now
this
is
a
major
innovation
in
our
law.
the
act
of
state
doctrine
has
never
been
so
limited
up
to
this
point.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
of
course,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
innovations
are
inappropriate.
once
in
a
while,
as
our
law
develops
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
think
you
are
now
getting
into
the
counter
claim
problem
which
is
somewhat
of
a
different
one
and
think
mr.
justice
brennan's
answer
to
that
in
the
national
city
bank
case
was
an
adequate
one
and
it
was
namely
when
he
asks
for
our
system
of
laws,
he
is
asking
among
other
things
the
act
of
state
doctrine
and
that
the
reasons
for
the
act
of
state
doctrine
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
convenience
of
the
foreign
sovereign.
it
has
to
do
with
our
own
problems,
our
own
division
of
responsibilities
between
the
executive
and
judicial
branch
of
the
government
and
while
it
maybe
true
that
we
do
not
want
to
insult
the
foreign
sovereigns,
the
important
burden
of
the
sabbatino
decision,
and
i
think
of
the
dissent
in
the
city
bank
case,
was
that,
the
important
problem
was
the
embarrassment
in
between
the
executive
branches
and
the
judicial
branches
of
the
government
rather
than
the
embarrassment
between
the
united
states
and
some
foreign
country.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no
sir,
i
would
say
it
was
an
effort
on
the
part
of
the
judiciary
to
maintain
its
independence
by
not
putting
itself
in
political
position
which
would
make
it
very
difficult
for
it
to
do
so
and
if
your
honor
would
take
a
reference
on
that,
i
think
that
my
last
brief
in
response
to
the
governments
brief,
i
cited
in
a
rather
extensive
footnote
the
comments
by
former
attorney
general
katzenbach
in
discussing
the
rosemarie
case
in
which
he
pointed
to
a
notorious
example
in
which
the
judiciary
of
great
britain
was
forced
into
a
position
where
it
had
to
make
a
finding
in
one
way
or
the
other
on
an
issue
because
the
government
had
so
committed
itself
to
that
position
that
to
have
otherwise
would
have
resulted
in
a
very
serious
conflict
between
the
judiciary
and
the
government
and
this
is
precisely
what
i
think
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
designed
among
other
things
to
accomplish.
but
when
we
get
to
the
question
between
political
versus
commercial
obligations,
and
the
government's
i
say
contentions
that
we
know
have
a
restrictive
theory
of
act
of
state.
the
government's
contention
here
is
based
on
first,
the
government
says
that
this
is
primarily
by
analogy.
it
is
by
analogy
to
the
restrictive
sovereign
immunity.
we
have
a
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity,
a
theory
which
incidentally
has
never
been
passed
upon
this
court.
and
therefore,
we
should
have
a
restrictive
theory
of
act
of
state
as
well.
the
restrictive
theory
is
as
formulated
by
the
tate
letter
in
the
state
department
was
that
sovereign
immunity
should
not
apply
to
urie
gestiones
or
commercial
transactions,
business
transactions
i
guess
would
be
a
better
translation
but
should
apply
to
urie
imperia.
now
that
distinction
which
was
established
by
the
tate
letter,
has
not
had
a
history
that
should
commend
itself
to
its
extension.
every
commentator
or
almost
commentator
discussing
that
question
has
found
that
very
difficult
to
make
this
distinction.
the
usual
example
given
is
the
contract
by
which
a
government
buys
shoes
for
its
army.
the
government
in
its
brief
in
this
case,
says
that
is
obviously
a
commercial
transaction.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
victory
transport
case
said
it
finds
such
a
contention
astonishing.
it
is
obviously
a
governmental
action.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
dichotomy
between
commercial
and
political
or
commercial
and
business
and
government
is
in
the
era
in
which
we
leave.
a
false
one
because
there
are
many
acts
which
are
both
commercial
and
highly
political.
we
need
only
read
the
newspapers
to
see
that
large
numbers
of
our
commercial
transactions
whether
it
be
oil
from
the
middle
east
or
it
be
wheat
to
russia
or
it
be
copper
from
the
operated
copper
mines
in
chile,
all
of
these
which
on
the
surface
appear
to
be
commercial
transactions
which
in
effect
have
tremendous
political
implications
and
therefore
what
i
suggest
a
slick
and
easy
distinction
between
the
two
is
one
that
should
be
accepted
with
a
great
deal
of
caution.
now,
let
us
take
this
case,
counsel
various
times
in
brief
here
have
referred
to
this
as
a
commercial
transaction.
as
i
did
my
best
to
point
out
this
morning,
this
was
not
a
commercial
transaction
at
all.
it
was
a
transaction
not
involving
a
debt
between
tobacco
merchants
as
someone
put
it
in
one
of
the
briefs,
but
a
transaction
which
arouse
out
of,
it
was
one
of
a
long
series
of
political
decrees
in
the
republic
of
cuba
in
the
course
of
the
transformation
in
the
course
of
the
transformation
of
the
economic,
social
and
political
systems
of
that
government
which
took
place
beginning
in
1960
and
i
suppose
extending
right
on
into
the
present
this
intervention
decree
was
one
of
many
intervention
decrees,
which
nationalized
private
property
in
cuba.
in
no
sense
was
it
a
commercial
transaction.
since
that
time
cuba
has
engaged
in
extensive
commercial
transactions
between
tobacco
merchants.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
best
of
the
customers
of
cuba
throughout
the
world
is
dunhill,
which
purchases
cigars
in
large
numbers
and
sells
them
throughout
canada
and
england
and
perhaps
in
other
parts
of
the
world
without
any
problems
about
commercial
repudiation
of
debts
or
anything
like
that.
those
are
ordinary
commercial
transactions;
no
questions
are
raised
about
sovereign
immunity,
about
the
act
of
state
when
there
is
a
dispute
about
whether
the
cigars
are
wormy
or
not
wormy,
or
whatever
else
happens
to
cigars.
the
disputes
are
settled
in
the
normal
course.
nobody
pleads
sovereign
immunity.
nobody
pleads
the
act
of
state,
the
business
goes
on
in
perfectly
normal
way.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
transaction
at
all,
this
transaction
was
a
transaction
which
was
originally
a
transaction
which
expropriated,
and
which
cuba
expropriated
the
property
not
on
dunhill,
expropriated
the
property
of
its
own
citizens.
it
was
a
political
act
and
in
no
way
a
commercial
act
and
that
has
been
the
guts
and
the
source,
and
the
origin
of
the
problem
that
existed
here.
the
formulation
that
mr.
justice
stevens
referred
to
a
while
ago,
i
believe
that
it
was
a
brief
in
petition
to
opposition,
the
petition
for
certiori,
must
be
read,
i
submit
against
the
background
of
this.
it
was
not
a
new
repudiation
of
a
commercial
debt.
it
was
an
old
position
that
had
been
taken
from
the
very
beginning.
i
think
that
the
origin
of
the
formulation
which
i
agree
now
was
an
unfortunate
one
is
due
to
the
fact
that
at
time
we
were
talking
about
a
court
of
appeals’
decision.
we
were
trying
to
dissuade
this
court
from
issuing
certiori
to
review
a
court
of
appeal's
decision
and
we
used
the
language
which
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
used.
but
certainly,
it
was
never
regarded
by
anyone
as
a
commercial
as
distinguished
from
a
political
transaction.
now,
the
fact
is,
that
the
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
which
the
government
places
a
great
deal
of
reliance
on
has
not
been
applied
at
all
by
the
state
department
in
delicate
and
difficult
and
troublesome
situations.
i
refer
to
in
my
brief
to
three
notorious
cases
in
which
this
is
true.
in
rich
v.
naviera
vacuba,
in
spacil
against
crowe
and
i
believe
in
as
branson
against
the
president
of
india,
there
were
three
transactions
which
was
perfectly
normal
everyday
commercial
transactions,
involving
the
sale
of
copper,
the
sale
of
wheat
and
an
attachment
by
a
long
shoreman
who
wanted
wages.
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
the
state
department
filed
a
suggestion
of
immunity
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
tate
letter
and
when
it
was
asked
to
explain
it
said,
we
do
not
have
to
explain.
as
a
matter
of
executive
discretion,
we
do
not
have
to
explain
anything.
we
can
apply
the
tate
letter
or
not
apply
the
tate
letter
as
we
wish.
now
i
respectfully
suggest
that
this
is
not
a
rule
of
law
that
should
be
automatically,
without
much
more
thought
be
extended
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
sovereign
immunity
and
act
of
state.
sovereign
immunity
never
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
situation
at
all.
sovereign
immunity
merely
relates
to
a
question
of
jurisdiction
and
it
has
in
historical
terms,
a
base
involving
a
committee
between
nations
of
the
fact
that
a
country
might
be
insulted
if
it
was
sued
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states
that
this
is
an
upfront
to
a
foreign
sovereign
to
sue
it
in
the
united
states.
we
have
a
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
in
our
own
law
affecting
the
right
of
a
citizen
to
sue
the
united
states
modified
by
statute
but
still
a
doctrine
which
in
the
absence
a
statute
exists.
there
is
nothing
strange
or
revolutionary
or
restrictive
about
the
ancient
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
quite
a
different
matter.
now
we
are
concerned,
and
for
the
first
time,
unlike
in
the
sovereign
immunity
case,
we
are
concerned
with
passing
on
the
question
of
the
validity,
well
known
of
the
act
of
a
foreign
sovereign.
this
is
a
question
that
never
arises
in
connection
with
sovereign
immunity.
i
think
it
will
always
arise
in
connection
with
the
act
of
state.
it
is
only
that
in
the
act
of
state
area
that
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
merits
of
the
controversy.
in
the
sovereign
immunity
situation,
we
stop
at
the
very
beginning
and
say
either
we
have
jurisdiction
or
we
do
not
have
a
jurisdiction.
when
we
get
to
the
act
of
state,
the
problem
is
a
much
more
serious
one
and
as
i
say,
it
seems
to
be
that
the
extension
of
a
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
which
have
not
been
noticeable
for
its
success,
should
not
be
made
so
quickly
to
the
act
of
state
area
and
particularly
is
that
true
because
so
far
this
case
is
concerned,
as
i
have
pointed
out,
i
do
not
believe
that
we
have
in
any
sense
of
the
word,
a
commercial
transaction,
it
is
a
political
transaction.
i
suppose
it
had
commercial
aspect
just
like
many
political
acts
have
commercial
aspect
but
primarily
and
in
its
essence,
the
issue
that
was
raised
here
is
a
political
issue
and
not
a
commercial
issue
and
the
extension
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
will
raise
all
sorts
of
problems.
i
do
not
know
how
the
courts
have
handled
rich
against
naviera
vacuba,
had
it
not
been
for
the
wise
judgment
of
the
state
department
in
filing
a
suggestion
of
immunity
in
that
case
in
clear
violation
of
the
tate
letter
because
it
would
have
resulted
in
a
most
difficult
and
troublesome
problem,
the
matter
is
discussed
at
great
length
and
in
my
brief
and
in
texts
that
i
have
referred
to
in
the
brief.
i
think
that
it
will
appear
clear
there
that
the
courts
would
have
been
placed
in
a
intolerable
position.
had
it
not
been
for
the
state
department
for
bailing
it
out
with
the
suggestion
of
immunity?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
if
i
had
my
choice,
i
would
prefer
an
absolute
theory
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
am
willing
to
tolerate
it
because
no
one
has
done.
if
you
proceed
with
a
theory
of
restrictive
immunity
then
there
has
to
be
an
escape
hatch.
there
must
be
an
escape
hatch,
otherwise
how
will
you
deal
with
naviera
vacuba?
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
well,
i
think
not,
with
all
do
respect.
i
do
not
believe
and
i
was
going
to
come
to
that
in
a
little
while
in
connection
with
the
latest
bernstein
letter
i
suppose
to
call
it
the
lee
letter
now.
i
was
going
to
come
to
that
and
i
will
in
a
few
minutes.
i
think
that
the
necessity
of
having
an
escape
hatch
or
door-out
to
save
the
court
from
really
very
serious
embarrassment
in
the
naviera
vacuba
situation,
is
an
unfortunate
thing
and
it
would
have
been
saved,
had
we
had
an
absolute
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
to
begin
with.
we
did
not
and
therefore
we
had
to
find
this
alternative
method.
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
we
did
not
have
to
find
it
because
we
may
not
always
have
a
state
department
as
alert
to
needs
of
the
situation
as
existed
at
that
time.
in
any
event,
i
would
have
preferred
not
to
have
rely
on
executive
discretion
concerned
as
it
is
as
with
many
political
considerations
in
the
situation
like
that.
however,
in
closing
on
this
point,
i
just
want
say
what
counsel
has
already
refuted
before
i
said
it.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
doctrine
of
act
of
state
or
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
is
part
of
the
arsenal
of
a
trading
nation.
i
think
that
most
trading
nations
rely
upon
act
of
state
or
sovereign
immunity
in
only
very
rare
situations
and
only
when
i
suggest
the
political
issue
is
somewhere
hidden
deep.
i
do
not
want
to
make
this
as
an
absolute
rule
but
i
would
say
that
it
is
probably
true
as
a
generality.
only
when
there
is
a
political
issue
which
is
hidden
deep
in
the
background
of
the
case
which
makes
it
difficult
to
defend
the
case
on
other
grounds
and
therefore
the
defendant
must
rely
on
one
of
these
other
defenses.
the
letter
of
the
legal
adviser
in
this
case,
it
is
not
clear
whether
it
is
a
part
of
the
justice
department's
brief
or
not.
this
legal
adviser,
unlike
his
predecessors
in
the
bernstein
case
and
in
the
city
bank
case,
makes
very
broad
pronouncements
of
state
departments’
policy
which
look
far
into
the
future.
the
last
sentence
of
his
brief,
for
example
is,
it
is
our
view
that
if
the
court
should
decide
to
overrule
the
holding
in
sabbatino
so
that
the
act
of
state
would
thereafter
be
subject
to
adjudication
in
american
courts
under
international
law,
we
would
not
anticipate
embarrassment
to
the
conduct
of
the
future
policy
of
the
united
states.
we
congratulate
the
state
department
on
its
ability
to
see
so
clearly
into
the
future.
that
talent
was
unfortunately
not
shared
by
its
predecessor
state
department.
the
state
department
in
the
sabbatino
case
took
a
directly
contrary
position.
there
it
strongly
supported
the
sabbatino
case
in
argument
before
this
court.
it
opposed
any
changes
in
the
doctrine
in
opposing
the
hickenlooper
amendment
attorney
general
katzenbach,
as
i
said
has
written
extensively
on
the
subject
since
and
it
is
obvious
that
other
state
departments
have
not
been
able
to
see
the
future
as
clearly
as
the
current
state
department
does.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
your
honor
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
foreign
decisions
are
not
readily
assailable
to
ours.
if
you
look
at
the
example
of
the
anglo-iranian
cases,
you
find
that
the
italian
and
japanese
cases
came
to
the
same
conclusion,
came
to
an
act
of
state
conclusion
even
though
they
did
not
refer
to
the
act
of
state,
they
referred
to
other
grounds.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
do
not
know
of
any
decision
of
cuba
at
all.
i
might
say,
the
government
makes
a
great
play
of
the
foreign
decisions.
i
might
say
that
foreign
law
differs
from
the
law
of
the
united
states
in
many
respects
and
i
think
that
the
law
of
the
united
states
is
vastly
superior
to
the
law
of
many
foreign
countries
and
the
fact
that
other
countries
do
not
adopt
the
act
of
state
doctrine
does
not
seem
to
me
to
be
decisive
as
to
what
we
ought
to
do.
we
have
our
own
constitution.
we
have
our
own
relationship
between
judiciary
and
executive.
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
to
us
is
a
very
critical
point
in
our
existence
and
in
our
constitutional
structure
and
the
act
of
state
doctrine
may
not
be
so
important
to
other
countries
which
have
different
constitutions
and
different
traditions.
just
closing
with
respect
to
the
lee
letter
and
it
really
responds
to
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
said
a
little
while
ago.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
can
be
expected
to
follow
the
state
department
around.
when
one
state
department
says
we
consider
the
act
of
state
doctrine
to
be
essential,
to
the
independence
of
the
judiciary.
this
court
is
supposed
to
say
yes
and
we
think
so
to
and
when
another
state
department
comes
along
and
says
we
do
not
think
the
act
of
state
doctrine
or
the
sabbatino
doctrine
has
any
significance
or
whatsoever,
we
do
not
anticipate
any
embarrassment
in
the
future.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
is
supposed
to
say
that
is
right
also.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
am
not
willing
to
do
it
your
honor.
i
do
not
have
a
choice
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
that
maybe
when
i
say,
i
do
not
mean
that
i
do
not
personally
have
a
choice.
i
think
that
the
state
department
the
ex
parte
peru
doctrine.
let
me
put
it
this
way,
the
doctrine
which
seems
to
be
followed
by
many
of
the
district
courts,
namely
that
the
state
departments
view
not
only
as
to
the
granting
of
immunity
but
as
to
the
denial
of
the
immunity
is
conclusive.
i
would
suggest
that
that
doctrine
would
be
unnecessary
if
we
had
an
absolute
theory
of
sovereign
immunity.
since
we
have
a
restrictive
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
which
is
for
reasons
that
i
have
just
set
forth,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
workable.
we
have
find
a
way
out
because
it
is
not
workable
and
so
we
have
these
letters
such
as
the
suggestions
which
were
filed
in
the
spacil
case,
naviera
vacuba
and
this
branson
case,
all
of
which
appeared
on
their
face
to
be
commercial
transactions
but
the
state
department
apparently
held
that
they
were
political.
i
would
like
to
get
now
to
sabbatino.
as
i
said
a
few
moments
ago,
the
sabbatino
case
held
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
will
apply
even
when
question
at
issue
or
act
in
question
is
alleged
to
be
a
violation
of
international
law
and
therefore
we
met
at
the
threshold
were
the
problems,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
what
is
the
question
of
international
law
in
this
case?
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
been
able
to
suggest
no
question
of
international
law
at
all.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
am
sorry,
we
misunderstand
each
other
or
i
misunderstand
you
perhaps.
under
the
sabbatino
decision
as
i
understand
it,
when
an
act
of
state
is
alleged,
it
is
no
response
when
an
act
of
state
is
pleaded
as
a
defense,
it
is
not
a
valid
response
to
say
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
not
applicable
in
this
case
because
there
is
a
violation
of
international
law.
that
is
what
the
court
held
as
i
understand
it
in
the
sabbatino
and
it
is
on
that
issue
your
honor
dissented.
therefore
the
problem
here
as
to
whether
the
sabbatino
decision
applies
and
i
might
say
that
nobody
even
mentions
sabbatino
in
the
lower
courts
in
this
case.
it
was
not
until
the
re-argument
in
this
court
that
anybody
even
dreamed
for
a
moment
that
sabbatino
had
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
and
the
reason
that
nobody
dreamed
that
sabbatino
had
anything
to
do
with
the
case
was
because
the
first
step
was
never
taken.
namely,
cuba
pleaded
act
of
state
and
no
one
said,
your
act
of
state
is
a
violation
of
international
law
and
no
one
said
it
because
there
is
no
ground
for
saying.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
would
doubt
it
your
honor.
it
is
possible
but
even
now
when
the
court
has
directed
that
the
matter
be
re-argued,
no
one
has
been
able
to
point
to
a
respect
in
which
the
act
of
state
that
we
are
talking
about
is
a
violation
of
international
law.
even
now
no
one
claims
that
it
is
a
violation
of
international
law.
it
is
true
that
the
petitioner
because
the
court
asked
him
to
consider
the
question
and
therefore
he
had
to
do
it.
he
says
all
this
is
a
violation
of
international
law,
discrimination.
what
discrimination?
at
no
point
are
we
told
what
the
act
of
discrimination
is.
so
where
is
the
violation
of
international
law?
what
has
happened
here?
cuba
seized
the
property
of
its
own
nationals.
no
violation
of
international
law
there.
money
came
down
into
cuba;
there
was
a
dispute
at
the
time
about
whether
this
money
belonged
to
the
former
owners
or
to
the
cuban
government.
but
there
was
never
a
dispute
about
whether
it
belonged
to
dunhill.
dunhill
owed
the
money
and
it
was
paying
it.
no
question
of
international
law
raised
yet.
finally,
we
get
to
the
district
court,
because
that
is
the
next
thing
that
happened.
the
district
court
hands
down
a
decision
which
says
and
dunhill
makes
a
demand
that
dunhill
paid
this
money
by
mistake.
dunhill
incidentally
argued
all
the
way
through
here
that
they
had
not
paid
the
money
by
mistake.
that
they
were
paying
their
debt
and
that
was
what
they
had
to
do
and
they
did
it
and
that
is
also
in
one
of
these
petitions
for
certiori
that
is
pending
before
you
your
honors.
but
dunhill
said,
now
argue
that
well
if
we
have
to
pay
the
former
owners,
then
we
paid
the
money
by
mistake
and
we
want
it
back
and
so
the
court
issued
a
decree.
well,
a
decree
of
the
united
states
court
does
not
transform
an
act
of
cuba,
done
in
cuba
from
an
act
which
is
consistent
with
international
law
to
an
act
which
is
inconsistent
with
international
law.
i
am
sorry
my
time
is
up.
at
no
point
here
have
we
had
any
definition
of
the
illegal
act
which
would
give
rise
to
any
question
at
all
as
to
whether
the
sabbatino
decisions
applies.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
i
have
never
heard
or
suggested
that
failure
to
pay
your
debt
is
a
violation.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
failure
to
pay
your
debt
has
never
been
suggested
as
a
violation
by
an
alien.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
it
does
not
matter.
it
may
be
a
breach
of
contract
but
it
does
not
make
it
a
violation
of
international
law.
it
is
my
understanding,
again
i
can
refer
to
my
brief
that
it
says,
always
been
the
position
of
the
law,
the
position
of
the
united
states,
commentators
were
on
too
many
decisions
on
it,
that
a
mere
breach
of
contract,
refusal
to
pay
money
is
not
a
violation
of
international
law.
in
the
absence
of
some
discrimination
or
some
other
conduct
which
would
indicate
improper
dealing
with
an
alien.
breach
of
contract
is
not
such.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
no
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
the
district
court
said
along
time
after
that
the
money
had
been
paid
by
mistake,
dunhill’s
mistake
not
cuba’s
mistake.
mr.
victor
rabinowitz
dunhill’s
mistake,
the
money
has
been
paid
by
mistake
and
therefore
cuba
was
required
to
pay
it
back.
certainly,
the
refusal
of
cuba
to
obey
a
decree
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
is
not
a
violation
of
international
law
anymore
than
it
would
be
a
violation
of
international
law.
if
the
converse
were
true,
if
cuba
made
a
decree
and
the
united
states
refused
to
accept,
that
would
hardly
be
a
violation
of
international
law.
