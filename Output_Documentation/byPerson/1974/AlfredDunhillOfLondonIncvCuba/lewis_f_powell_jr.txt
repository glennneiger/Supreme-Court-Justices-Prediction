mr.
friedman,
is
there
really
any
doubt
as
to
the
fact
that
cuba
as
repudiated
these
debts?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
had
they
paid
any
of
them
to
anybody
in
this
country
since
castro
took
power?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
second
circuit
as
i
read
the
opinion
found
an
act
of
state
in
view
of
all
of
the
circumstances
and
said
that
a
form
of
declaration
was
not
necessary,
and
you
differ
from
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn't.
i
would
prefer
not
to
have
to
characterize
that
as
even
with
the
word
optimism.
i
think
even
that's
too
hopeful
a
word.
no,
i
don't
know
why
or
why
counsel
is
doing
it.
i
suppose
counsel
is
here
because
his
client
is
instructed
him
to
be
here
and
he's
got
whatever
motivation
he
has
go
ahead
with
this
case,
and
maybe
he
thinks
she
can
in
some
way
or
other
collect
it.
and
if
he
does,
he's
doing
very
well
for
his
client.
