unknown
speaker
is
that
the
only
act
of
state
the
court
of
appeals
identified?
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
mentioned
in
the
--
unknown
speaker
let
us
get
that
straight;
i
have
some
difficulty
following
these
changes
of
position.
in
their
brief
in
opposition
of
the
petition
for
certiori,
they
contended
that
the
nationalization
included
the
nationalization
of
the
accounts
receivable.
the
decree
itself,
the
act
of
state
included
the
nationalization
of
the
accounts
receivable
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
am
looking
at
unknown
speaker
you
are
reading
from
the
petition
of
certiori?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
as
i
read
in
on
page
three
it
says
that
they
argued
that
even
if
they
received
the
payments.,
the
payments
are
not
recoverable
in
this
suit
because,
one
the
nationalization
of
the
owners
property
included
the
account
of
the
nationalization
of
the
owners
accounts
receivable
and
hence
the
interveners
was
entitled
to
payments
and
questions.
maybe
this
is
a
wrong
argument
here.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
there
is
not
such
a
great
difference
between
the
argument
that
they
nationalized
the
accounts
receivable
and
an
argument
which
they
now
make
in
all
events,
we
nationalize
the
payments
on
the
account
on
the
accounts
receivable
as
they
came
in.
unknown
speaker
but
i
suppose
their
theory
would
be,
that
when
they
arrived,
they
became
the
payments
of
the
prior
owners.
unknown
speaker
do
they
clearly
retain
their
situs
in
the
united
states
when
payment
is
made
on
the
account;
i
suppose
that
is
a
part
of
the
problem?
unknown
speaker
they
would
not
seek
to
recover
them
in
that
litigation
is
that
complete
abandonment
of
the
right
or
what
is
that?
unknown
speaker
in
this
fact,
you
are
more
or
less
in
agreement
with
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
with
that
opinion,
you
also
said
that
that
was
a
second
circuit?
unknown
speaker
did
that
opinion
address
any
distinction?
unknown
speaker
mr.
scalia,
is
there
any
country
that
you
know
of
that
concede
or
admit
today
that
it
applies
the
act
of
state
doctrine
to
commercial
transactions?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
generally?
unknown
speaker
in
its
application
of
perhaps
without
conceding
that
in
fact
is
what
is
being
done.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree
that
your
characterization
in
that
part
of
the
transcript
of
the
act
of
the
state
is
quite
different
from
your
characterization,
when
you
said,
for
seven
long
years,
it
has
been
asserting
that
its
repudiation
of
the
debt
was
an
act
of
state?
they
are
two
quite
different
concepts
i
think.
unknown
speaker
the
debt
then
arrived
until
the
money
arrived.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
rabinowitz,
the
debt
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
the
decree
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
what
were
you
referring
to
as
the
debt
when
you
referred
to
the
repudiation
of
the
debt
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
it
is
clear
that
the
debt
referred
to
your
obligation
to
return
the
money
that
have
been
delivered
to
cuba.
that
is
what
you
are
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
that
debt
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
the
decree.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
another
way
of
saying
that,
it
did
not
existed
the
time
of
the
decree.
unknown
speaker
therefore
the
decree
could
not
be
the
repudiation
of
a
subsequently
created
debt.
unknown
speaker
was
it
that
time,
property
of
the
intervened
company?
unknown
speaker
if
you
are
correct,
as
to
the
consequences
of
the
intervention,
your
argument
certainly
should
be
and
i
suppose
it
was
that
this
so
called
debt
should
never
been
adjudicated?
unknown
speaker
that
you
did
not
know
anything?
unknown
speaker
because
it
was
your
money
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
but
those
judgments
of
the
court
still
stand,
i
take
it
that
you
owed
the
money.
was
it
your
claim?
i
thought
that
is
what
you
claimed
in
your
response
to
your
petition
for
certiori,
that
even
if
you
owed
it,
you
repudiated
it?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
that
if
you
owed
the
money,
you
nevertheless
had
repudiated
the
debt
as
an
act
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
defended
that
judgment
in
your
response
to
the
petition
of
certiori?
unknown
speaker
yes,
when
you
did
in
your
response
to
the
petition
for
certiori?
unknown
speaker
on
that
basis,
you
claimed
that
there
should
not
have
been
any
set
off
either
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
one
way
or
the
other
because
on
that
basis
there
never
was
any
debt,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well
let
us
assume
that
in
the
case,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
raised
as
a
defense
to
an
action
and
the
other
side
says
well,
it
should
not
be
a
defense
because
this
is
a
violation
of
international
law.
now,
sabbatino,
you
suggest
says
that
the
prior
response
is
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
if
it
were
worth
something
and
the
act
of
state
doctrine
would
not
bar
an
action,
if
it
were
in
violation
of
international
law,
you
have
to
go
through
the
process
of
deciding
whether
it
is
in
violation
of
the
international
law.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is
decided
that
the
act
does
not
violate
the
international
law,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
then
is
a
defense.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
are
going
to
go
through
that
process
of
deciding
whether
it
is
a
violation
of
international
law,
where
does
sabbatino
stand?
unknown
speaker
you
are
supposed
to
stop
before
you
ever
decide
whether
it
is
in
violation
of
international
law.
unknown
speaker
well
mr.
rabinowitz,
your
argument
on
the
sovereign
immunity
point
seems
to
be
that
you
approve
of
this
sort
of
discretion
in
the
state
department
to
on
occasion
invoke
sovereign
immunity.
unknown
speaker
nonetheless,
you
are
willing
to
tolerate
it
in
the
areas
with
sovereign
immunity?
unknown
speaker
but
nonetheless,
you
are
very
opposed
to
the
notion
of
the
bernstein
letter
in
the
act
of
state.
i
think
there
is
a
fair
analogy
between
them.
unknown
speaker
well
you
may
not
have
a
choice
here
either[laughing]
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
might
they
not
have
refrained
from
saying
it
because
they
considered
that
sabbatino
as
being
binding?
unknown
speaker
suppose
mr.
rabinowitz,
if
you
talked
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
act
of
state,
if
there
was
one
was
in
the
repudiation
of
some
later
debt?
did
you
say
the
same
thing
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well
i
know
an
act
of
state
with
respect
to
a
so
called
debt
that
has
some
situs
in
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
owned
by
an
alien?
unknown
speaker
but
the
act
of
state,
the
court
of
appeals
found
was
mere
refusal
to
pay
back
money,
was
yet
found
that
you
wrongfully
received
and
wrongfully
taken?
unknown
speaker
they
say
it
was
dunhillâ€™s
money
and
you
took
it,
is
not
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
said?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
would
you
contend
that
the
intervention
of
the
cigar
companies
was
a
commercial
or
political
transaction?
unknown
speaker
if
you
win
this
case
in
your
judgment,
if
you
win
a
judgment
over
and
above
the
amount
of
the
set
off,
how
are
you
supposed
to
collect
it?
unknown
speaker
so
you
in
effect,
would
put
it
within
the
prior
--
within
the
first
national
city?
unknown
speaker
but
the
situation
has
changed
since
you
were
here
last?
unknown
speaker
mr.
friedman,
let
me
ask
more
question.
if
you
view
the
act
of
state
as
the
retention
of
the
payments
pursuant
to
the
decree
as
cuba
argued,
i
know
you
say
we
must
grant
your
cert
for
petition,
if
we
do
that,
but
in
that
event,
would
the
act
be
commercial
or
political?
