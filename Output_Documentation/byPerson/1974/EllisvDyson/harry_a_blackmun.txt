justice
harry
a.
blackmun
for
the
first
case,
ellis
against
dyson
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
petitioners
here
were
convicted
and
fined
by
the
municipal
court
of
the
city
of
dallas
on
their
pleas
of
nolo
contendere
for
violating
the
dallas
loitering
ordinance.
they
did
not
seek
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
county
court
as
they
were
entitled
to
do.
instead
they
brought
the
present
action
in
the
federal
court
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance
and
seeking
declaratory
and
other
relief.
the
federal
court
dismissed
the
action
and
held
that
such
relief
against
future
state
criminal
prosecutions
was
not
available.
in
so
doing,
it
relied
upon
a
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
district
court's
controlling
court.
word
was
held
that
the
principles
of
younger
against
harris
applied
where
a
state
criminal
prosecution
was
merely
threatened.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
on
which
the
district
court
had
relied
was
subsequently
reversed
in
our
case
entitled
steffel
against
thompson.
we
there
held
that
federal
declaratory
relief
was
not
precluded
when
a
state
prosecution
based
upon
an
assertedly
unconstitutional
state
statute
had
been
threatened
but
was
not
pending.
as
a
consequence,
we
reversed
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
and
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
reconsideration
on
the
light
of
steffel
as
to
whether
there
is
a
genuine
threat
of
prosecution
here
and
as
to
the
relationship
between
the
past
prosecution
of
the
petitioners
and
the
alleged
threat
of
future
prosecutions.
i'm
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
and
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
stewart
has
joined
and
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined
in
part.
