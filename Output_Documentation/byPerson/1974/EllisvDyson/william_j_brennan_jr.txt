justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
neuborne,
are
the
petitioners
here
still
living
in
dallas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
they
are
not
living
there,
the
case
certainly
is
moot
as
to
any
possible
future
arrests?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
either
res
judicata
would
enough
to
be
barred?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
very
dysfunction
argument
in
sometime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
given
that
the
records
you
have
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
your
honor,
we
will
--
first
their
arrest
and
conviction
records
will
be
expunged
and
in
terms
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
your
answer
to
younger?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
doesn't
younger
rather
than
steffel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
and
the
state
agree
that
that
is
the
effect
of
a
nolo
plea
in
texas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
--
so
what
--
it
certainly
didn't
bar
you
for
appealing
up
through
the
state
system.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
or
it
didn't
bar
you
from
raising
your
federal
claims
further
in
the
state
system?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that
but
there
was
no
bar.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
question
about
it
your
honor.
no
question
about
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
conner
i
have
one
other
question.
i
think
there
is
inference
or
implication
somewhere
that
the
prosecution
in
dallas
has
a
practice
dismisses
chargers
under
the
loitering
ordinance
once
someone
has
taken
the
necessary
steps
for
a
trial
de
novo.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
they
didn't
go
for
each
other.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
was.
there
was
one
which
could
have
been
in
a
conviction
which
could
have
been
appealed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
up
to
the
extent
younger
might
make?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
we
have
a
different
story
of
the
(inaudible)
as
far
as
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
it
might
be
different
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
think
a
while
ago
in
your
brief
that
if
you
have
had
trial
de
novo
is
that
your
constitutional
claim
that's
been
rejected
and
been
convicted
in
and
then
tell
to
appeal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
younger?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
touched
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
honor,
in
the
novo
appeal
the
potential
sentence,
the
potential
maximum
was
20
times
greater.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
younger?
if
you
could
have
stop
there
without
going
under
the
states
supreme
court
or
to
whatever
you
have
to
go
under
the
taxes
procedure
before
you'd
exhausted
all
to
this
remedy
and
you
say
that
would
a
barred
your
action
in
federal
court?
why
doesn't
it,
in
fact
that's
what
you're
in
now?
