chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-130,
ellis
against
dyson.
mr.
neuborne
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
what
you
say,
would
it
be
entirely
unreasonable
to
suggest
that
you
are
lawyers
without
clients
at
the
moment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
know
where
they
are?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
returning
to
the
questions
of
mr.
justice
marshall
a
few
minutes
ago,
you
got
a
petition
for
certiorari
filed
in
this
court
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
ago
and
during
that
year
and
a
half
the
period,
we
don't
know
whether
there's
a
case
or
controversy
still
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yet
the
whole
machinery
of
the
course
has
been
involved
in
dealing
with
this
case
which
we're
not
sure
and
you
can't
assure
us
is
a
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suggest
to
you
that
it's
hardly
the
time
of
the
case
that
ought
to
engaged
the
attention
of
this
court
with
all
else
it
has
to
do
to
wait
until
the
case
has
been
here
for
a
year
and
a
half
to
find
out
whether
there's
any
case
at
all
and
that
is
calling
you
personally
considering
your
job
as
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
intend
it
personally.
you're
performing
your
function
as
counsel
that
i'm
speaking
to
the
question
of
the
role
of
this
court
and
how
our
time
should
be
consumed
and
then
defined.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
there's
no
personal
criticism.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
neuborne.
mr.
conner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page,
do
you
have
the
page?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
a
few
minutes
left
mr.
neuborne.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
73-130,
ellis
against
dyson
and
73-1543,
johnson
against
the
railway
express
agency
will
each
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
