mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
five-named
respondents
in
this
present
litigation:
frank
m.
dyson,
the
former
chief
of
police
for
the
city
of
dallas
and
alex
bickley,
the
present
city
attorney
of
dallas,
scott
mcdonald,
former
city
manager
of
city
of
dallas,
hugh
jones,
former
clerk
municipal
court
and
wes
wise,
the
present
incumbent
mayor
who
soon
is
subject
to
going
through
an
election
and
campaign
for
his
re-election.
the
facts
in
this
case
briefly
the
petitioners
were
arrested
in
january
8,
1972
at
2
a.m.
i
differ
with
counsel
as
to
their
version
of
the
facts.
the
facts
are
set
out,
are
at
least
our
version
of
the
facts
are
set
out
in
the
arrest
report
that's
made
a
part
of
appendix
of
this
file.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
i
don't,
it's
the
arrest
report
which
refers
to
the
petitioner
love.
it
is
indexed
in
the
appendix.
i
believed
page
46,
47
and
i
think
the
next
page
also
your
honor.
the
petitioners'
theory
of
the
case
is
that
they
were
looking
for
an
apartment.
the
arrest
report
indicates
that
it
was
in
an
area
where
new
homes
were
being
constructed,
it
is
an
area
of
north
dallas,
a
residential
area
that
shortly
subsequent
to
the
arrest
there
was
a
report
of
burglaries
in
the
area.
there
had
been
burglaries
at
night
in
this
particular
area.
it
was
2
a.m.
on
a
week
night,
there
was
protective
agency
in
the
area
and
these
were
the
only
vehicles
apparently
or
the
only
persons
in
that
area
shortly
after
the
call.
it
was
upon
this
information
that
the
police
officers
arrested
the
petitioners.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
sir,
one
of
the
petitioners
had
a
ticket
which
he
did
not
dispose
of.
he
did
not
--
it
was
alias.
he
didn't
pay
his
fine
nor
did
he
--
he
did
take
a
play
on
the
case
but
then
pay
his
fine.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
i
believe
it
was
one
of
them.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
an
alias
ticket
is
one
that
hasn't
been
disposed
of
by
payment
of
a
fine.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
by
payment
of
a
fine.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
it's
a
ticket
or
citation
that
usually
a
minor
misdemeanor
traffic
citation
type
matter
which
they
either
took
a
plea
of
guilty
or
they
just
never
did
come
in
to
municipal
court
and
dispose
of.
in
those
instances,
the
procedures
of
the
dallas
police
department
is
when
they
do
reach
an
individual
who
has
an
alias
citation.
they
bring
him
to
the
police
station
and
may
compose
a
ban
to
ensure
their
presence
are
at
least
the
forfeiture
of
their
ban.
the
petitioners
have
assert
in
their
brief
and
through
that
this
case
that
they
have
use
diligence
in
the
state
court.
we
assert
they
have
not
use
diligence
in
any
manner.
they
plead
guilty
or
no
contest.
statute
said
it's
one
and
the
same.
they
took
the
$10.00
fine
and
$2.50
court
cost
and
they
plead
out
and
did
nothing
further
in
the
state
courts.
they
present
two
questions
in
this
action.
one
is
--
having
once
been
fined
are
they
proper
persons
to
bring
declaratory
judgment
for
the
threatened
future
arrest.
and
also
they
pray
for
an
expungement.
in
the
respondent's
answer
to
the
complaint,
we
assert
it
then
and
we
asert
now
that
the
petitioners
have
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relieve
can
be
granted.
they
did
not
assert
any
allegations
of
bad
faith
or
harassment
against
these
respondents.
they
showed
and
indicated
by
the
pleadings
no
irreparable
harm
or
injury.
we've
also
asserted
and
still
maintain
they
did
not
give
any
showing
of
diligence.
their
action
with
respect
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
is
putting
the
cart
in
front
of
the
horse.
it
was
not
timely,
it's
not
raisable,
it's
not
appropriate.
they
had
the
right
to
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
county
court
of
appeals.
they
indicate
that
this
was
some
more
severe
punishment
than
possibly
one
could
have
obtained
in
municipal
court.
i
disagree.
the
fine
in
both
courts,
the
maximum
would
have
been
$200.00.
the
exposure
in
municipal
court
is
no
greater
and
it
was
in
the
county
court
of
appeals.
a
fine
--
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
yes.
they
have
--
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
i
believe,
your
honor,
it's
10
days.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
correct.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
in
my
best
knowledge,
i'm
almost
positive
yes,
its
10
days.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
i'm
sure
of
that,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
sir,
it
--
for
purposes
of
this
case,
yes
it
is
in
effect
to
the
extent
of
number
of
arrests,
i
do
not
know
but
it
still
is
being
use
and
enforce.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
no,
it
has
not.
it
is
the
respondents'
position
that
there
is
not
a
case
or
controversy
here.
these
individuals
are
not
proper
persons
to
test
the
constitutionality
of
the
city's
ordinance.
in
light
a
post
steffel
or
any
decision
of
this
court.
the
court
should
look
at
this
case
at
the
time
of
this
review
and
not
at
the
time
that
it
was
initiated.
this
is
the
usual
rule
in
federal
cases.
it's
not
our
burden
to
prove
a
case
or
controversy.
we've
been
stating
that
they're
one
a
case
or
controversy
that
they
were
proper
persons
from
the
initiation
of
this
suit
and
i'll
take
this
position
is
stronger
now
than
ever
before.
there
is
no
case
or
controversy.
these
are
not
proper
persons
to
bring
this
action.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
well
we
did
and
in
this
case
--
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
they
did
plead
out.
we
didn't
dismiss
it.
we're
ready
for
trial
in
this
case.
the
law
student
who
wrote
the
affidavit
i
believe
on
page
40
to
41
of
the
appendix
said,
we
dismiss
maybe
a
quarter
of
the
cases.
yes
there
are
dismissals
your
honor
but
i
don't
think
it's
a
practice
of
customarily
dismissing
it
when
we
see
the
eyes
of
an
attorney,
no
sir.
this
court
is
said
it's
a
rare
case
where
single
prosecution
constitutes
a
quantum
of
harm
to
justify
federal
intervention,
i
say
this
case
sir
has
been
no
showing
of
harm
to
justify
federal
intervention.
we
can't
look
at
the
subjective
feelings
are
only
the
subjective
feelings
of
one
of
the
petitioners
said
i
have
a
chilling,
feeling
about
my
first
amendment
rights
being
affected.
we
got
to
look
to
the
genuine
threats
if
they
are
genuine
and
look
at
the
objective
findings
in
the
record
of
the
five
respondents
only
two
of
them
remained.
there
is
no
showing
as
to
the
actions
of
the
incumbent
city
officials.
there
has
been
no
harassment
or
no
bad
faith
alleged.
there's
been
no
pattern
of
arrest
indicated
which
would
apply
to
these
persons
that
wouldn't
to
apply
anyone
else.
the
city
of
dallas
hadn't
been
shown
to
go
laughter
and
just
prosecute
hippies
or
college
students
or
any
ethnic
social
group
or
any
racial
minority
or
any
distinct
class
of
persons
which
the
petitioners'
might
belong.
the
law
student
indicated
that
there
are
40
to
maybe
50
arrests
a
month
under
this
ordinance.
i
maintain
it's
highly
speculative
and
conjectural
that
these
persons
will
again
be
arrested
under
this
ordinance.
just
sheer
mathematics
if
they
were
in
dallas
and
we
don't
have
a
showing
that
they
are
and
they
probably
are
not,
we
are
in
municipality,
the
8th
largest
city
in
the
country
with
a
population
in
1970
of
844,000
and
a
county
population
in
excess
of
a
million
three.
and
the
mere
mathematic
possibilities
are
very
remote
particularly
for
someone
whose
whereabouts
can't
even
be
shown
to
be
in
dallas.
the
petitioners
waived
with
the
advice
of
counsel
their
right
to
poceed
further.
this
court
has
look
closely
anytime
someone
takes
a
plea
and
waives
his
constitutional
right
to
proceed.
i
think
this
court
should
particularly
consider
this
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
this
is
a
misdemeanor
offense
and
look
what
posture
it
puts
the
respondents.
how
can
we
proceed
further
when
the
petitioners
plead
out?
we
cannot
go
further.
we
are
barred
from
going
any
further.
yes
we
took
a
plea
of
guilty
and
what
else
can
you
expect
of
the
respondents
and
look
what
posture
the
petitioner's
have
placed
us
the
respondents.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
your
honor
i
think,
it
was
decided
under
younger
doctrine
primarily
and
the
interpretation
of
the
fifth
circuit
of
younger.
steffel
makes
the
most
strongest
argument
as
the
case
of
controversy
the
genuineness
of
the
threat
of
prosecution
in
ellis
decision
also
strongly
support
the
position
that
in
only
cases
of
genuine
threats
of
future
prosecution
should
this
court
or
any
other
court
entertain
federal
intervention
and
i
think
that
position
is
made
more
stronger
by
recent
decision
this
court
than
ever
before.
i
also
--
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
yes
and
not
at
the
time
the
action
was
initiated
by
the
time
of
review.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
a
case
or
controversy
or
a
genuine
threat
or
future
prosecutions
sufficient
to
involve
the
intervention
of
[voice
overlap].
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
correct,
and
i
think
the
court
should
look
in
the
pattern
of
practices
of
the
respondents
or
the
government
officials
involved
and
see
whether
or
not
there
is
a
genuine
threat
and
there
are
no
allegations
in
the
complaint
and
no
allegations
today
or
anytime.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
i
would
believe
and
i
do
urge
that
younger
v.
harris
should
be
applicable
or
at
least
considered
in
this
court
ruling.
the
only
thing
that
precludes
younger
from
being
considered
here
is
that
there's
no
pending
prosecution
and
that
was
the
payment
of
fund.
mr.
douglas
h.
conner,
iii
right
but
the
petitioners
by
their
own
actions
took
the
less
stringent
course
and
say
they're
not
bound
by
younger
because
we
pay
the
fine.
now
i
think
that's
rewarding
so
the
last
diligent
from
a
stringent
guidelines
of
younger
which
i
think
are
inappropriate
and
unfair
to
any
litigant
in
federal
court
and
particularly
one
who
act
past
position
to
the
respondents.
the
court
in
steffel
spoke
of
res
judicata
difficulties
and
i
think
this
is
res
judicata
difficulties
here
there
was
a
plea
in
municipal
court
and
it
was
over.
this
court
would
be
substituting
itself
for
the
county
court
of
appeals
to
reverse
or
change
over
this
decision
and
it
would
have
a
definite
res
judicata
effect.
i
think
to
remand
this
case
would
be
a
reward
or
award
to
the
non-diligent
to
take
them
away
from
this
stringent
and
rulings
of
younger
v.
harris.
i
think
the
court
should
see
that
there
is
no
case
or
controversy
and
ellis
and
steffel
both
assert
in
this
court's
trend
to
look,
to
see
of
a
genuineness
of
these
threats
a
possible
prosecution.
i
like
to
reserve
whatever
remains
moments
i
have
for
rebuttal.
