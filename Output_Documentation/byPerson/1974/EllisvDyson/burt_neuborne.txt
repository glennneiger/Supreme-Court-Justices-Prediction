mr.
burt
neuborne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
bert
neuborne,
i
represent
the
petitioners
herein
tom
ellis,
a
white
college
student
at
eastville
college
in
dallas,
texas
and
robert
love.
a
black
graduate
student
at
the
southern
methodist
university
school
of
music.
petitioners
were
arrested
at
2
a.m.
on
january
18,
1972
under
a
dallas
loitering
ordinance
while
driving
in
tom
ellis'
car
in
the
suburb
of
dallas.
at
the
time
of
their
arrest,
petitioners
were
attempting
to
determine
which
of
several
possible
apartments
that
mr.
love
had
looked
at
during
the
day
would
be
most
appropriate
for
mr.
love
to
rent.
apart
from
the
mere
presence
in
the
automobile
at
2
o'clock
in
the
morning
in
dallas,
texas,
there
were
no
signs
of
criminal
activity.
and
obviously
petitioners'
arrest
in
the
vague
and
overbroad
dallas
ordinance
upon
which
it
was
based
raised
serious
constitutional
questions
under
this
court's
decision
in
papachristou
versus
jacksonville.
petitioners
initially
sought
to
raise
the
constitutional
questions
posed
by
the
dallas
ordinance
in
the
texas
state
courts.
they
first
brought
an
application
for
discretionary
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
on
february
14,
1972
and
an
application
for
discretionary
writ
was
based
on
the
facial
unconstitutionality
of
the
dallas
loitering
ordinance.
mr.
burt
neuborne
the
purpose
was
to
provide
that
the
texas
courts
with
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
constitutional
question.
mr.
burt
neuborne
pretrial,
yes
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
was
facially
unconstitutional,
yes
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
the
form
--
the
charge
i
believe
was
an
information
for
loitering
under
the
dallas
ordinance.
it
is
the
description
of
the
arrest
and
the
officer's
description
of
the
arrest
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
in
the
handwriting
of
the
officers
and
is
before
the
court.
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor,
we
have
been
unable
to
ascertain
at
the
present
time
the
whereabouts
of
the
petitioners.
we
have
made
preliminary
attempts
to
trace
them
through
their
parents,
and
those
preliminary
attempts
are
thus
far
been
unsuccessful
although
i
must
represent
to
the
court
that
the
attempts
have
been
preliminary.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
under
any
circumstances
whatever
resolution
of
the
issues
posed
by
this
appeal
that
on
remand
that
the
district
court
just
as
in
steffel
versus
thompson
of
the
passage
of
three
years
renders
it
imperative
that
additional
facts
be
taken
by
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
current
case
or
controversy
exists
for
two
reasons.
i
frankly,
have
no
information
concerning
the
current
enforcement
pattern
of
the
dallas
ordinance
nor
have
i
sufficient
information
to
discuss
with
the
court
the
current
status
of
the
petitioners
with
respect
to
the
ordinance.
of
course,
their
arrests
and
conviction
records
remain
and
that
would,
i
take
it
be
unaffected
by
the
present
whereabouts.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
would
think
that
is
correct
sir.
i
would
think
on
remand
--
under
the
disposition
that
we
think
the
preferred
disposition
of
this
case
would
be
a
vacation
of
the
orders
below.
and
a
reconsideration
in
light
of
steffel
versus
thompson
with
a
suggestion
to
the
district
court
that
they
undertake
the
same
type
of
investigation
that
this
court
suggested
the
georgia
district
court
take
in
steffel
versus
thompson.
after
presenting
the
discretionary
writ
of
prohibition
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
having
it
denied
on
february
21st,
petitioners
then
brought
a
motion
--
a
trial,
a
pretrial
motion
in
the
dallas
municipal
court,
the
corporation
court
of
dallas
in
which
they
attack
the
facial
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
think
not
sir.
i
think
there
is
at
least
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
you
don't
know
where
they
live
in
dallas
and
you
don't
know
whether
they're
disposed
as
to
perhaps
this
litigation?
your
honor,
the
contact
which
the
southern
methodist
university
law
clinic
has
had
with
the
clients.
the
last
contact
which
was
a
year
ago
indicated
that
they
wish
to
present
to
continue
with
the
litigation
especially
as
it
affects
their
arrest
and
conviction
records.
i
suggest
to
the
court
had
been
at
least
as
the
arrest
and
conviction
records
of
these
young
people
both
of
whom
were
college
students.
and
who
would
be
severely
adversely
prejudiced
in
their
later
lives
by
a
conviction
record
such
as
this
but
there
is
at
least
a
live
controversy
and
an
obligation
upon
the
attorneys
to
continue
to
try
to
clear
the
records
of
these
individuals
and
in
this
situation.
when
the
motion
was
dismiss
in
the
dallas
municipal
court
the
motion
attacking
the
facial
unconstitutionality
of
the
statute,
petitioners'
counsel
in
the
municipal
court
then
faced
a
critical
procedural
decision.
and
a
procedural
decision
which,
your
honors,
we
suggest
has
shaped
the
subsequent
course
of
this
litigation.
petitioners'
counsel
at
that
point
after
this
pretrial
motion
had
been
dismissed
had
two
courses
of
action
open
to
him.
first,
he
could
have
followed
the
more
traditional
course,
which
wouldn't
have
been
to
press
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
dallas
ordinance
through
the
texas
courts.
that
course
of
action
had
three
serious
disabilities.
first,
the
texas
courts
maintain
a
two-tier
system
of
justice
similar
to
the
two-tier
system
of
justice,
which
this
court
sustained
in
colten
versus
kentucky
two
years
ago.
so
that
the
price
oppressing
the
petitioners'
claims
through
the
texas
court
system
was
the
risk
of
a
substantially
increase
sentence
upon
presentation
in
the
trial
de
novo
to
a
county
court.
indeed,
it
would
have
turned
out
that
the
potential
risk
would
have
been
a
20-time
--
a
20-fold
increase
in
the
fine.
but
secondly,
and
i
think
even
more
importantly
in
terms
of
a
lawyer
trying
to
do
a
good
job
for
his
client
back
in
1972,
the
procedural
issue
which
the
counsel
for
the
petitioners
faced
in
the
dallas
court
was
he
problem
of
issue
preclusion.
if
he
continued
to
voluntarily
present
the
constitutionality
of
the
dallas
ordinance
to
the
texas
state
courts
on
a
theory
of
issue
preclusion,
election
of
remedies,
or
res
judicata,
or
some
other
type
of
theory.
he
might
have
been
deemed
at
that
point
where
he
did
to
continue
to
go
to
the
merits
and
to
reach
the
determination
on
the
merits
in
the
dallas
municipal
court.
he
might
have
been
barred
from
litigating
the
issue
further
in
the
federal
courts
at
some
subsequent
point
and
that
is
precisely,
your
honors,
what
happened
to
counsel
in
thistlethwaite
versus
new
york
which
is
reported
at
497
f.2d
339
where
they
followed
the
more
traditional
rule
and
went
up
through
the
state
court
system
on
a
challenging
park
permit
regulation
on
which
there
was
only
a
$5
fine
and
for
which
of
course
habeas
corpus
would
probably
not
lie
in
a
subsequent
proceeding
and
when
they
had
exhausted
all
their
state
traditional
remedies
and
sought
to
raised
the
constitutionality
of
the
new
york
city
park
permit
statute
as
applied
to
prospective
distributions
of
leaflets
in
the
park.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir,
i
was
coming.
the
choice
that
the
petitioner's
counsel
made
at
that
point
was
to
exercise
an
element
of
the
offering
compromise,
which
your
honor
mentioned
in
colten
versus
kentucky
as
a
significant
aspect
of
the
two-tier
system.
what
petitioner's
counsel
did
at
that
point
was
offer
to
plead
nolo
contendere
which
under
texas
law
has
no
collateral
res
judicata
effect
disposes
of
the
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
that
was
a
pretrial
motion
to
dismiss,
your
honor
but
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
there
was
a
ruling
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
sir
but
--
but
the
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
your
honor,
we
suggested
that
the
final
judgment
would
not
have
attached
until
the
texas
court
reached
the
full
merits
of
the
determination
on
the
--
as
to
guilt
or
innocence.
in
other
words,
there
was
an
initial
preliminary
motion
to
dismiss.
once
that
motion
to
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
my
understanding
sir
is
that
the
entry
of
the
nolo
contendere
plea
under
texas
law
and
i
am
not
an
expert
on
texas
law
but
my
understanding
of
texas
law
is
that
we
would
have
not
been
barred.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
is
precisely
the
reason
for
the
offer
of
the
nolo
contendere.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir
and
the
whole
purpose
of
presenting
that
constitutional
issue
to
texas
court
was
to
provide
them
with
the
option
if
they
wish
to
reach
the
issues
and
if
they
chose
not
to
reach
the
issues
to
at
least
permit
the
petitioners
to
reserve
their
federal
rights
for
litigation
at
some
future
points.
and
that
was,
as
i
understand
it
the
counsel's
purpose
in
proceeding
by
nolo
contendere
under
these
circumstances.
we
believe
your
honor
under
any
circumstances
that
even
without
the
nolo
plea
that
there
would
have
been
no
res
judicata
preclusion
here
and
of
course
we'll
deal
with
that.
mr.
burt
neuborne
we
think
that
there
are
five
probable
--
possible
reasons
why
res
judicata
should
not
apply.
first,
the
considerations
of
nolo
but
second
the
considerations
which
your
honor
adverted
to
in
the
dissent
from
certiorari
in
mack.
and
that's
when
1983
actions
are
concerned
there
is
at
least
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
res
judicata
should
be
applied
when
its
full
vigor
to
such
a
determination
especially
we're
here
it
is
being
used
as
the
functional
equivalent
in
some
part
of
the
role
that's
played
by
federal
habeas
corpus
in
granting
ultimate
federal
review
and
issues
of
criminal
jurisprudence
raising
constitutional
questions.
third,
we
believe
the
that
existence
of
the
texas
two-tier
system
which
would
have
missed
--
which
would
have
forced
petitioners
to
risk
a
20-fold
increase
in
there
sentence
as
the
price
of
appealing
from
any
adverse
decision
in
the
texas
municipal
court
cuts
very
heavily
against
precluding
the
petitioners
from
seeking
a
remedy
to
in
federal
court,
while
texas
under
this
court's
decision
in
colten
versus
kentucky
may
condition
access
to
the
texas
courts
undergoing
a
trial
de
novo
with
the
possibility
of
an
increase
sentence.
we
suggest
it
is
a
far
crime
from
that
to
access
--
to
condition
access
to
the
federal
courts
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871
on
the
same
requirement
that
you
risk
a
substantially
more
severe
sentence
as
the
price
for
exercising
the
choice
of
forum
rights
which
congress
determined
to
give
to
civil
rights
litigants.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir,
you
are
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir,
the
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
no,
sir.
what
i
meant
was
that
it
doesn't
have
any
collateral
effect.
it
doesn't
have
any
res
judicata
effect
on
subsequent
proceedings
in
texas.
it
is
not
an
admission
of
guilt
for
example
in
a
subsequent
civil
proceeding.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir,
very
different
from
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
burt
neuborne
a
guilty
plea
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
for
--
your
honor,
i
think
texas
follows
the
traditional
rule
that
would
be
followed
in
the
federal
court.
for
example
if
there's
an
antitrust
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
if
there's
an
antitrust
prosec
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
that's
my
understanding
of
the
texas
law.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
your
honor
if
i
could
read
you
that
texas
statute
which
my
colleague
has
pointed
out
to
you.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i'm
sorry
i
should
have
gotten
to
it
much
sooner.
the
legal
effect
--
this
is
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure
annotated
article
2702
subsection
6
in
1965.
the
legal
effect
of
such
plead
referring
to
a
nolo
contendere
plea
shall
be
the
same
as
that
of
the
plea
of
guilty.
but
the
plea
may
not
be
used
against
the
defendant
as
an
admission
in
any
civil
suit
based
upon
or
growing
out
of
the
act
upon
which
the
criminal
prosecution
is
based.
mr.
burt
neuborne
but
your
honor
as
i
understood,
i
understood
that
and
i
think
your
honor's
suggestion
that
the
texas
practice
is
the
same
as
the
federal
antitrust
practice
is
correct.
but
under
federal
antitrust
practice,
the
entrance
of
the
nolo
plea
by
a
defendant
cannot
be
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
civil
proceeding
to
determine
that
the
underlying
legal
issues
and
that
legal
and
the
initial
criminal
proceeding
were
to
be
resolved
adversely
to
him
and
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
we
want
all
--
all
petitioners.
well,
perhaps
then,
i
should
clarify
what
petitioners
seek
precisely
in
this
case.
petitioners
are
not
attempting
in
this
case
collaterally
attack
the
texas
judgment.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
your
honor
petitioners
seek
three
causes
of
action
and
because
the
case
below
which
disposed
of
under
becker
versus
thompson,
no
court
below
found
it
necessary
to
analyze
the
three
causes
of
action
separately
but
i
suggest
that
the
separate
analysis
of
the
cause
of
action
is
critical
you
make
it
in
a
proper
resolution.
petitioner's
first
cause
of
action
and
their
primary
cause
of
action
is
a
cause
of
action
based
on
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
identical
to
the
steffel
declaratory
judgment
protecting
them
against
the
threat
of
the
future
prosecution.
petitioner's
second
course
of
action
was
a
determination
not
that
the
conviction
be
voided
but
simply
that
texas
be
restrained
in
some
way
from
disseminating
records
of
the
conviction
in
the
future.
in
other
words
the
fine,
the
punishment
whatever
texas
did
to
petitioners
was
inappropriate
imposition
of
sentence
under
nolo
contendere
of
plea.
mr.
burt
neuborne
that
as
far
as
i
know
is
a
normal
cause
of
action
and
one
which
the
district
court
never
reached
your
honor
because
it
felt
that
it
could
not
even
entertain
the
first
cause
of
action.
i
suggest
on
remand
that
these
are
questions
if
this
court
were
dispose
to
remand
but
these
are
questions
which
obviously
must
be
grappled
with
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
no,
sir.
i
say
that
there
is
--
there
are
that
we
must
determine
whether
it's
moot
on
remand.
it
may
well
be
on
remand
but
it
is
more.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no,
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no.
what
i
suggested
was
that
under
steffel
it
would
be
appropriate
on
remand
to
the
district
court
to
take
fresh
evidence
of
that
fact
but
this
case
is
now
three
years
old
your
honor.
it
was
filed
in
march
of
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no,
sir.
we
don't--
we
do
not
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
we
don't
suggest
your
honor.
mr.
burt
neuborne
because
of
the
absence
of
a
two-tier
problem
in
a
direct
appeal
situation.
mr.
burt
neuborne
oh!
i
see,
i
understand.
probably
res
judicata
or
if
not
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
it's
not
res
judicata
younger
versus
harris,
the
notion
that
the
criminal
preceding
continues
on
to
the
very
end.
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
then
the
issue
would
turn
on
what
the
cause
of
action
was.
if
the
cause
of
action
were
a
collateral
attack
on
the
conviction
itself,
i
think
that
younger
would
bar,
so
if
that
the
cause
of
action
would
prospect
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
in
no
circumstances
but
i
think
the
critical
distinction
and
the
distinction
which
i'm
trying
to
articulate
is
the
difference
between
the
cause
of
action
which
is
retrospective
in
nature
and
looks
backward
to
attempt
to
impeach
the
judgment
itself
and
a
judgment
which
is
declaratory
and
prospective
in
nature
under
the
steffel
rule
and
which
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
but
in
terms
of
the
ordinary
and
normal
dissemination
of
the
arrest
and
conviction
records,
which
go
on
in
everyday
life
at
least,
that
will
stop
for
the
petitioners.
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor,
we
will
make
every
effort
to
notify
them
personally.
i
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it
approximately
a
year
ago.
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor,
i'm
counsel
in
new
york.
may
i
have
a
moment
to
check
with
my
co-counsel
on
that
point?
mr.
burt
neuborne
if
i
have
personally
heard
from
them?
mr.
burt
neuborne
no
sir,
i
came
into
this
case.
mr.
burt
neuborne
oh,
yes,
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
oh,
did
you
just
say
in
this
room,
mr.
powell?
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor,
counsel
who
has
dealt
personally
with
them
is
professor
walter
steele.
mr.
burt
neuborne
at
the
southern
methodist
university.
no
sir
i'm
afraid
he
is
not.
mr.
burt
neuborne
professor
kennedy
tells
me
the
original
authorization
was
in
writing
but
he
doesn't
know
whether
the
last
contact
a
year
ago
was
in
writing
or
not.
mr.
burt
neuborne
what
they
want
right
now,
your
honor
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well
based
on
the
authorization
which
they
gave
to
counsel,
when
the
case
was
originally
begun.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
sir.
it's
possible
that
they
don't
care
about
their
arrest
and
conviction
records
anymore
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it's
not
like
it.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
don't
know
that
you
have.
mr.
burt
neuborne
we
suggested
to
the
court
and
i
think
appropriately
so
that
the
problem
--
a
problem
with
this
case
is
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
go
forward
with
the
prospective
causes
of
action
under
fed
--
under
generalized
notions
of
federalism
but
there
was
at
the
time
it
was
presented
to
the
district
court
in
1972
a
live
case
or
controversy.
unfortunately,
the
district
court
believing
itself
bound
by
becker
versus
thompson
failed
to
reach
that
case
or
controversy.
three
years
have
now
passed
since
that
occurrence.
i
would
be
the
last
person
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
court
should
blindly
proceed
in
the
face
of
three
--
of
the
passage
of
three
years
time
without
adducing
fresh
facts
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
suggested
to
the
court
that
the
preferred
disposition
of
this
case
is
a
vacation
or
the
decisions
below
in
light
of
steffel
versus
thompson
and
a
remand
to
the
district
court
for
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
anything
live
before
the
court.
we
seek
no
more
than
that
in
this
proceeding.
we
believe
that
if
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
my
understanding
is
that
you
can
if
you
wish
vacate
a
decision
of
the
court
below
on
the
grounds
that
it
either
has
become
moot
or
that
the
case
or
controversy
no
longer
exist
and
remand
to
that
court
below
for
the
taking
of
evidence.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i'm
suggesting
that
there
is
possibility
of
it,
yes.
i
mean
your
honors,
i
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor
what
if,
what
we
suggest
that
you
do
is
write
a
one
line
vacation
of
the
district
court's
dismissal
and
a
remand
to
the
district
court
to
simply
determine
whether
under
the
principles
that
this
court
are
laid
out
last
year
in
steffel
versus
thompson,
there's
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
your
honor
mootness
and
lack
of
standing
in
the
case
like
this
seems
to
come
in
a
full
circle.
if
the
petitioners
no
longer
have
a
live
case
or
controversy,
whether
one
calls
it
lack
of
standing
or
one
calls
it
mootness,
that
is
something
which
ought
to
be
determined
on
remand
in
the
district
court
and
we
suggest
the
appropriateness
of
that
as
a
disposition
of
this
matter.
we
do
not
suggest
this
case
as
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
major
consideration
of
the
issue.
our
primary
point
in
our
brief
was
a
suggestion
that
since
both
lower
courts
are
dispose
of
this
case
without
an
analysis,
properly
so
because
they
found
themselves
barred
by
becker
versus
thompson
from
considering
the
difficult
question
in
the
case
raises
at
the
appropriate
way
to
dispose
of
this
case
is
vacate
those
decisions,
remand
to
the
district
court,
see
whether
there
is
a
live
case
or
controversy
and
start
all
over
again
in
the
light
of
post
steffel
jurisprudence.
this
court
is
being
asked
to
rule
on
very
difficult
issues
on
a
difficult
record
in
which
there
has
been
no
analysis
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i'm
sorry
sir?
mr.
burt
neuborne
younger
doesn't
apply
because
the
pending
prosecution
was
over
a
full
month
before
the
proceeding
began
and
the
pending
prosecution
was
over
your
honor
with
the
consent
of
the
state
of
texas.
a
normal
plea
need
not
be
accepted
under
texas
law.
it
was
accepted
by
the
judge
as
a
speedy
way
to
disposed
of
that
particular
proceeding
and
not
to
disclose
of
the
underlying
legal
issues
which
that
proceeding
raised.
i
suggest
too
your
honor,
that
a
nolo
plea
under
the
facts
of
this
case
is
the
functional
equivalent
in
a
criminal
case
of
the
england
reserve
in
the
civil
case
and
that
you
are
present
or
involuntarily
in
a
state
form.
you
urge
the
state
form,
alright
you
have
me
in
the
state
form,
you
can
convict
me
under
a
nolo
plea
but
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
right
to
litigate
the
underlying
federal
issues
until
some
subsequent
point.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
have
not
discuss
the
matter
with
the
state
but
from
the
statute
that
was
the
understanding
of
counsel
when
he
offered
the
nolo
plea,
that
is
the
understanding
of
counsel
today
when
we
present
it
to
the
court.
mr.
burt
neuborne
no
sir
and
on
that
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
no
sir
except
under
those
circumstances
had
we
done
so,
i
fear
that
we
would
have
been
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
oh,
no
sir,
we
were
--
except
for
the
bar
that's
raised
by
the
danger
of
a
20-fold
increase
in
sentence
in
the
two-tier
system
of
justice
which
texas
maintains
which
your
honor
can
be
a
substantial
impediment
to
proceedings.
petitioners
were
fined
$10.00
and
the
potential
maximum
that
they
could
have
received
on
a
trial
de
novo
was
$200.00
fund.
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor,
when
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor,
when
we
learned
of
the
problems
in
locating
the
plaintiffs,
that's
when
we
in
our
--
for
the
first
time
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
suggested
to
the
court
the
appropriateness
of
a
remand
in
this
case
and
not
a
plenary
consideration
on
the
merits.
mr.
burt
neuborne
we
--
i
take
it,
i
take
it.
no
sir,
i
take
it
as
a
personal
criticism,
i
apologize
to
the
court
because
i
think
you
we're
right.
i
should
have
notified
you
earlier.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
understand
that
and
i
agree
with
it
completely.
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
yes
sir.
that's
--
i
think
that's
why
we
did
but
i
think
the
chief
justice
is
absolutely
correct
that
we
should
have
been
more
explicit
as
to
why
we
were
saying
it.
we
thought
that
it
came
across
clearly
enough
in
the
papers
but
we
should
have
been
more
explicit
as
to
why
we
thought
a
steffel
remand
was
appropriate.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
burt
neuborne
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
merely
on
the
case
or
controversy
point
the
--
as
we
have
understood
at
the
case
or
controversy
perimeter
which
this
court
had
laid
down
both
in
steffel
and
earlier
on
boyle
versus
landry
flowed
somewhat
like
this.
in
steffel,
there
was
direct
threat
to
a
direct
person
and
that
was
held
to
give
sufficient
standing.
in
long
island
vietnam
moratorium
versus
cahn
which
this
court
affirmed
last
year
there
was
generalized
threat
by
a
prosecutor
to
the
public
at
large
and
that
was
sufficient
to
give
standing.
in
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton
there
was
a
mere
existence
of
the
statutes
themselves
unaccompanied
by
any
specific
threat
and
that
was
held
sufficient
to
give
standing.
and
in
epperson
versus
arkansas,
there
was
a
discredited
statute
which
been
on
the
books
--
which
would
not
been
enforced
since
1928
and
in
epperson,
that
was
held
sufficient
to
give
standing.
we
think
that
the
petitioners
at
least
in
19
--
in
january
of
1972
when
the
case
or
controversy
was
originally
or
march
of
1972.
when
the
case
or
controversy
was
originally
submitted
to
the
federal
court
manifested
as
sufficient
state,
sufficient
future
arrest
which
was
neither
chimerical
nor
imaginary
within
the
language
of
this
court.
in
that,
the
only
conduct
which
they
have
been
guilty
of
was
to
be
guilty
of
being
on
a
dallas
street
at
2
o'clock
in
the
morning
in
a
car
driving
in
the
dallas
suburb.
they
had
no
idea
why
they
we're
arrested.
they
had
no
idea
what
conduct
on
their
part
attribute
the
arrest.
indeed,
you
had
a
statute
sufficiently
broad
that
would
virtually
invite
dragnet
and
suspicion
arrests,
and
if
these
people
don't
have
standing
to
challenge
the
statute
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
hypothesize
anyone
else
to
whom
the
statute
might
be
applied
who
would
have
standing.
it's
a
very
vice
of
a
dallas
ordinance
that
it's
so
vague,
so
without
standards
but
it's
not
directed
particularly
at
anybody
that
there
is
a
virtual
grant
of
untrammeled
discretion
to
the
police
to
make
whatever
arrests
they
wish.
having
been
arrested
under
at
once
we
think
that
wouldn't
have
been
sufficient
back
in
1972
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
case
controversy
especially
given
the
pattern,
the
recurrent
patterns
of
enforcement
which
the
dallas
police
were
engaged
in.
your
honor,
we
do
not
ask
this
court
all
to
substitute
itself
or
the
federal
courts
to
substitute
itself
from
appellate
form.
the
only
thing
that
we
ask
in
this
case,
is
that
if
a
jurisdiction
which
permits
nolo
contendere
is
prepared
to
allow
a
criminal
defendant
to
offer
a
nolo
contendere
to
plea
and
to
take
the
nolo
contendere
to
plea
that
under
general
principles
of
nolo
law
that,
that
grants
a
benefit
to
the
state
and
then
it
allows
the
state
a
speedy
disposition
of
the
particular
proceeding
and
the
imposition
of
sanctions.
on
the
other
hand,
the
person
who
offered
the
nolo
plea
himself
is
attempting
to
reserve
for
himself
the
opportunity
should
have
be
appropriate
to
litigate
the
underlying
legal
issues
in
a
federal
court
pursuant
to
the
choice
of
form
rules
granted
by
the
civil
rights
act
of
1871.
in
fact,
in
candor
the
basis
of
our
claim
is
that
a
nolo
plea
if
accepted
by
an
appropriate
jurisdiction
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
reserve
under
england
versus
louisiana
board
of
medical
examiners.
and
is
the
attempt
in
a
criminal
litigation
to
reserve
for
a
future
time
the
opportunity
to
present
underlying
legal
questions
to
a
federal
court.
the
option
whether
we
would
accept
it
lays
with
the
state.
the
state
was
under
no
obligation
to
accept
the
nolo
plea
but
they
did
so
and
under
those
circumstance
we
believed
that
the
petitioners
have
not
foreclose
their
rights
to
present
the
underlying
legal
issues
at
some
appropriate
times
to
a
federal
court.
mr.
burt
neuborne
oh,
of
course.
mr.
burt
neuborne
of
course.
of
course,
to
the
extent
this
is
appropriately
in
1983
action
is
now
i
take
it
axiomatic
that
there
is
no
obligation
to
exhaust
state
judicial
remedies
prior
to
the
presentation
of
a
constitutional
issue.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
think
state
judicial
remedies
too,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
well,
in
preiser
versus
rodriguez.
mr.
burt
neuborne
i
think
that's
right.
what
we
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes,
sir
and
the
reason
that
younger
we
think
does
not
apply
here
your
honor
was
the
nolo
contendere
aspect
of
this
case.
texas,
your
honor,
had
it
with
its
power
to
insist
upon
a
merit
determination.
mr.
burt
neuborne
it
would
be
a
different
issue,
yes
sir
it
would
be
a
great
deal
more
difficult.
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor
under
those
circumstances
i
want
to
know
whether
it
was
a
two-tier
system
of
justice
so
that
the
appeal
might
have
been
impeded.
in
the
absence
of
a
two
tier
system
of
justice
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
we
could
not
abuse
1983.
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir
but
your
honor,
but
your
honor
--
but
the
appeal
from
the
trial
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
burt
neuborne
the
difference
your
honor
is
that
a
trial
de
novo
to
sentence
that
one
receives
of
the
trial
de
novo
cannot
be
changed
on
appeal
except
in
accordance
with
restrictions
of
pierce
versus
north
carolina
so
that
there
is
no
threat
of
a
greater
sanction
cause
by
going
up
through
the
appellate
process.
but
when
you
go
a
trial
de
novo
you
take
the
risk
in
this
particular
case,
you
would
have
taken
a
risk
of
a
20-fold
increase
in
sentence
and
it's
that
impediment
on
the
free
exercise
of
the
appeal
that
we
think
distinguish
as
the
two
types
of
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
your
honor,
i
think
that
under
younger
principles
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
the
state
was
perfectly
entitled
to
impose
punishment
on
us
but
that
parking
seeking
--
mr.
burt
neuborne
yes
sir,
and
we
think
the
difference
is
that
in
a
nolo
situation
we
subjected
ourselves
the
state
interest
which
younger
was
designed
to
protect
was
the
capacity
to
prosecute
the
person
for
a
particular
incident.
they
have
vindicated
that
interest
in
this
case.
mr.
burt
neuborne
you
honor,
i
think
it's
an
important
line
because
the
state
interest
that
younger
was
designed
to
protect
was
the
ability
to
prosecute
a
particular
defendant
for
a
particular
incident
and
that
state
interest
has
been
vindicated
here.
these
defendants
have
paid
the
fine.
they
paid
the
penalty
that
texas
sought
it
impose
upon
them.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
be
foreclosed
from
raising
the
underlying
legal
issue
with
some
future
time
in
the
federal
forum
and
we
think
that
no
principle
of
younger
requires
that.
younger
doesn't
guarantee
that
courts,
the
state
courts
the
opportunity
to
pass
on
the
underlying
legal
issues.
it
only
guarantees
the
state
courts
the
capacity
to
complete
a
pending
prosecution
and
they
have
done
so
successfully
in
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
