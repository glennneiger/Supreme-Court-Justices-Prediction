justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that's
quite
different
all
than
saying
that
it
doesn't
have
any
collateral
effect
in
the
traditional
sense
because
you
take
the
federal
antitrust
judgments
and
certainly
the
texas
statute
sounds
like
it's
a
counter
part
of
them
permit
the
use
of
a
criminal
judgment
and
to
rather
unusual
way
in
a
civil
action.
if
there's
been
a
guilty
plea
and
it
sounds
to
me
like
other
saying
is
in
texas
is
that
a
nolo
plea
won't
have
this
broad
in
effect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
certainly
makes
sense
but
it
seems
to
me
that
falls
far
short
of
saying
that
he
is
not
bound
by
the
judgment
entered
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
asking
that
they
expunge,
aren't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
federal
basis
for
that
second
cause
of
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
law
to
suggest
these?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
could
have
re-litigated
these
issues
in
the
higher
court,
could
they
not,
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
suppose
your
suggestions
of
a
steffel
remand
with
these
following
the
steffel
procedure
determining
whether
there
is
a
live
case
or
controversy
represented
or
recognition
on
your
part
and
suggested
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
your
position
also
from
your
remarks
that
there
was
not
a
sufficiet
case
or
controversy
at
the
time
the
district
court
decided
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
it's
your
one
of
your
positions
is
that
only
aside
from
steffel,
younger
against
harris
as
far
as
this
1980
that
this
sued
in
the
state
court
or
in
a
federal
court
because
they
failed
to
follow
their
case
up
to
the
state
system.
but
younger
against
harris
would
--
that
there
would
have
been
a
criminal
case
pending
and
it
was
still
would
have
been
pending
if
that
appealed
their
case
and
presented
their
federal
constitutional
claims
in
the
state
courts.
