justice
potter
stewart
and
the
purpose
of
that
application
was
to
prevent
there
being
tried
at
all
or
through
it,
was
that
it
or
--?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
this
is
pretrial?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
what
they
asked
for
was
that
they
not
be
tried
at
all
because
the
statute
or
the
ordinance
was
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally,
what
was
the
form
of
the
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
why
it's
complied
by
the
judgment
of
a
municipal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
why
not
when
the
--
you
only
did
that
after
the
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
quite
a
general
ruling
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
by
texas
court?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
an
alias
ticket?
justice
potter
stewart
both
of
them
have?
justice
potter
stewart
both
45
which
has
to
do
with
ellis
and
46
which
has
to
do
with
mr.
love,
each
one
is
also
arrested
for
loitering
and
alias
tickets.
the
suspect
also
found
to
have
alias
ticket.
what
do
you
say
an
alias
ticket
is?
each
one
has.
justice
potter
stewart
about
what?
justice
potter
stewart
what
kind
of
--
is
one
what
that
hasn't
been
disposed
of?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
the
act?
i
noticed
that
upon
release
pleas
rendered
on
february
22,
1972,
had
they
pursued
a
trial
de
novo
that
would
have
been
a
next
step
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
about
how
much
time
did
they
have
to
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
from
february
22?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
filed
this
complaint
in
federal
court
on
march
27
that's
after
the
10th
day.
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
say
you
believe
10
days,
is
it
or
isn't
it
10
days?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
actually
--
they
let
the
time
for
that
appeal
run
out
before
they
brought
this
federal
court
action?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
conner
is
the
ordinance
still
in
effect
in
it's
the
same
form
or
has
it
been
amended?
justice
potter
stewart
has
its
constitutionality
been
tested
in
the
state
courts
anywhere
to
your
knowledge?
justice
potter
stewart
the
fact
remains
mr.
conner
does
it
not
that
the
district
court
here
dismissed
this
complaint
on
the
authority
of
becker
against
thompson?
justice
potter
stewart
and
becker
against
thompson
was
explicitly
overruled
by
this
court
and
steffel
against
thompson.
so
wouldn't
it
logically
follow
that
the
thing
to
do
is
to
remand
this
to
the
district
court
to
consider
the
case
free
of
misapprehension
that
becker
against
thompson
as
the
law?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
in
order
to
remand
we
have
to
find
the
case
or
controversy
here
and
now.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
exactly
my
position.
justice
potter
stewart
that
even
again
under
steffel
against
thompson?
this
plaintiff
didn't
show
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
maybe
a
case
or
controversy
but
there
wasn't
a
sufficient
allegation
of
a
genuine
threat
or
future
arrest
[voice
overlap].
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
gather
you
are
the
only
one
that
you
are
under
no
obligation
under
something
said
in
monroe
and
pape
and
preiser
and
rodriguez.
justice
potter
stewart
to
exhaust
any
traditional
relief.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
suggested
monroe
and
paper,
i
gather
that.
justice
potter
stewart
also,
the
language
in
preiser
is
only
for
remedy
under
the
civil
rights
act
is
available.
a
plaintiff
need
not
or
seek
to
address
in
the
state
for
on
them,
the
first
case
cited,
mr.
monroe
and
preiser,
356
at
183
where
it
was
suggested
that
you
not
exert
judiciary.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
don't
understand
if
you
can
see
that
why
then
you
are
not
in
the
same
position
not
having
taken
a
de
novo
with
you.
