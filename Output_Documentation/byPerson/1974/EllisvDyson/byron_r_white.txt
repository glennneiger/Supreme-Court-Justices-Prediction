justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
does
it
have
to
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
neuborne,
would
you
know
whether
under
these
circumstances
the
texas
court
would
know
the
bars
of
this
judgment
in
filing
a
civil
suit
a
(inaudible)
suit
in
the
texas
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
by
nolo
contendere
but
barred
by
the
courts
decision
on
your
motion
dismiss
in
which
you
presented
the
constitutional
issue
and
its
final
result.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not
mr.
neuborne?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
cause
of
action
again
has
a
plea?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
that
--
and
it's
not
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
also
suppose
he
appealed
that
you
have
trial
de
novo,
you
have
judgment
to
contest,
but
in
any
way
he
was
not
found
guilty?
and
then
you
cited
that
he
should
go
to
federal
court
rather
than
appeal
in
texas.
(inaudible)
texas
appellate
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
couldn't
suppose
directing
it
in
three
causes
is
open
to
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
rather
that's
affirm,
but
firmly
what
was
barred
was
it
res
judicata
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
younger
versus
harris?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
that
party,
let's
assume
that
in
trying
you
got
to
assume.
the
type
of
appeal
had
expired
and
so
there
was
no
criminal
case
pending,
it
would
still
say
that
younger
would
be
part
in
the
sense
that
it
could
always
have
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
falls,
it
falls
between
two
tools,
i'm
afraid
i
have
not
in
my
own
mind
your
honor.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
sir.
i
think
it
might
be
possible
although
it
might
be
possible
to
postulate
an
argument
that
said
that
the
conviction
when
made
was
proper
and
it
having
pleaded
nolo,
one
cannot
then
you
go
back
and
attempt
to
directly
impeach
the
conviction.
but
that
the
conviction
was
based
on
unconstitutional
statute
which
is
subsequently
been
found
to
be
unconstitutional
and
that
would
--
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
continue
to
punish
the
petitioners
on
a
daily
basis.
by
the
daily
dissemination
of
the
arrest
and
conviction
records
prospectively,
in
other
words
i
think
the
expunction
cause
of
action
has
some
elements
of
a
prospective
application
although
i
agree
with
the
court
that
there
is
at
least
as
to
the
expunction
aspects
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
sir.
well,
i
--
we
will
make
every
effort
to
find
them
and
to
notify
them
personally.
your
honors,
i
don't
--
yes
sir?
