mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
mr.
coblens.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
answer,
since
i
do
not
get
any
rebuttal,
i'd
like
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
of
my
friend.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
i
believe,
and
possibly
there
was
a
misunderstanding.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
judicial
precedent
upholding
an
order
of
this
kind.
there
is
an
order
that
the
commission
couldn't
even
find
and
nobody
else
could
until
they
dredged
it
up
which
they
claim
to
be
a
precedent
that
is
number
one.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
no,
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
your
honor,
except
the
fact
that
i
didn't
want
there
to
be
any
misunderstanding
that
there
was
a
judicial
precedent
upholding
in
order
of
this
kind
and
i
don't
think
that
there
has
been
a
judicial
precedent.
as
far
as
i
know,
this
is
the
first
case
of
this
kind
and
in
so
far
as
i
know,
as
far
as
the
industry
is
concerned,
this
matter
is
something
that
the
industry
as
such
was
not
aware
of,
at
least
not
recently.
now,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
a
statement
was
made
that
if
it
went
from
portland
to
denver
and
back
to
seattle
that
there
would
be
no
charge
it
is
my
understanding
that
is
not
the
correct
statement
of
the
facts.
i
have
been
informed
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
you
can
back
hold
a
car,
it
has
to
move
forward
from
west
to
east.
you
can't,
if
you
move
it
backwards
then
it
becomes
an
entirely
new
rate.
this
is
the
information
i
have
received
and
i
respectfully,
i
believe
my
brother
is
in
error
when
he
made
that
statement.
now,
with
respect
to
order
number
1134,
it
is
still
in
existence
and
as
my
brother
has
stated.
it
is
in
full
force
and
effect,
it
can
be
activated
by
the
commission
at
any
time
and
that
solely
in
the
discretion
of
the
commission
whether
it's
made
effective.
so,
that
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
dependent
upon
the
finding
of
emergency
but
as
of
the
lohman,
it
is
not
the
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
i
beg
your
pardon,
it
has
not
stayed
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
district
court
stayed
the
effectiveness
of
the
order.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
it
declared
it
null
and
void
not
by
reason
of
emergency
but
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
it
was
an
illegal
rate
order.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
it's
not
in
the
effect
in
so
far
as
becoming
effective
as
far
as
the
rates
are
concerned
but
the
district
court
made
no
finding
with
respect
to
emergency
because
certain
precedents
which
i
will
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
yes
sir.
this
is
true.
i
have
seen
the
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
each
time
as
far
as
i
recall
asserting
an
emergency.
now,
this
court
can
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
courts
below
on
one
of
two
grounds.
the
first
is
to
follow
the
reasoning
of
the
district
court
and
hold
that
service
order
number
1134
did
not
constitute
a
car
service
order
as
authorized
by
49
u.s.c.
1(15)
and
was
invalid
because
as
the
court
stated,
it
was
in
illegal
rate
fixing
order
developed
through
procedures
lacking
due
process.
now,
let
me
say
parenthetically,
nobody
before
this
court
argues
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
not
have
the
power
assuming
that
it
uses
due
process
to
do
what
it
desires
assuming
that
it
gives
due
hearing
with
respect
to
reconversion.
i
think
my
brother
admitted
that
if
it
uses
section
1549
u.s.c.
1(15),
it
can
issue
a
new
tariff
or
compel
a
new
tariff
but
in
that
case
of
course
we
would
have
to
have
a
hearing
and
the
industry
input
would
have
to
be
there
and
you
would
not
have
bungled
without
us
knowing
anything
about
it.
the
industry
would
have
an
opportunity
to
have
something
to
say.
at
this
point,
there
is
no
opportunity
whatsoever
the
order
was
issued
before
we
even
know
about
it
and
sometime
it
become
effective
before
the
industry
knows
anything
about
it.
so,
there
is
no
question
about
the
power
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
assuming
that
it
provides
ordinary
due
process
which
section
1(15)
does
not
provide
and
this
is
what
this
case
is
all
about
as
i
indicated
in
my
brief.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
well,
of
course
the
court
well
knows
the
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
by
time
i
would
say
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
but
your
honor,
we've
had
an
emergency
for
75
years
and
this
business
of
reconsignment
has
been
in
existence
for
50
years
and
as
my
brother
states,
they
can
expect
further
emergencies
from
time
to
time.
so,
that
when
you're
talking
in
terms
of
possibly
a
year
as
against
50
years
or
75
years,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
which
balances
the
interest
and
this
is
the
balance
wheel
of
the
nation
really
that
even
assuming
it
takes
a
year
they
give
due
process
which
it
might
very
well.
the
element
of
due
process
which
the
court
well
knows
is
so
important
is
worth
it
particularly
when
we
know
that
for
years
and
years
and
years
unless
something
is
done
we're
going
to
have
some
emergency
or
another,
if
it's
not
the
russian
grain
deal,
it
will
be
the
patagonian
wheat
deal
or
it
will
be
some
other
deal
that
will
come
in
and
because
the
basic
fact
is
there
just
not
enough
cars
and
when
you
don't
have
enough
cars
the
slightest
dislocation
causes
a
“emergency
on
the
basis
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission”.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
yes
sir,
they
filed
without
a
hearing
under
1(15)
if
they
found
an
emergency.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that
is
correct
sir
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
i
would
have
an
objection.
if
we
have
no
--
i'd
be
to
the
extent
possible
i
would
try
to
prevent
it.
my
basic
point
is
number
one,
the
court
below
held
that
this
was
a
rate
order
and
consequently
they
say
to
decide
as
a
rate
order.
in
addition
to
that,
as
i
would
like
to
propose
out
orally
argued,
the
fact
that
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
did
not
merely
affirm
on
the
basis
of
the
opinion
indicates
the
court
is
interested
in
the
broader
aspects
of
the
case,
then
the
points
made
by
the
court
below.
the
court
below
went
on
perfectly
sound
and
legal
grounds
namely
that
it
was
a
rate
order
and
section
1(15)
did
not
provide
for
changes
in
rates
but
there
is
underlying
this
whole
case
and
something
i'd
like
to
get
across
to
the
court
a
more
fundamental
question,
a
question
which
is
this
court
peculiarly
is
designed
to
take
care
of.
and
that
question
is
this,
“must
this
court
or
any
court
accept
the
ipse
dixit
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
inspite
of
all
the
evidence
to
the
contrary
that
the
freight
car
situation
on
the
nation's
railroad
is
a
temporary
emergency
which
should
be
dealt
with
under
the
provisions
of
491
u.s.c.
15
rather
than
a
long
continuing
and
probably
permanent
problem”
and
as
the
court
well
knows
this
is
what
we
have.
section
49
u.s.c.
114
which
is
the
general
rule
making
power
and
provides
full
due
process
procedures
and
section
49
u.s.c.
15
which
is
the
true
and
joint
rate
provision
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
provides
an
ordinary
means
of
dealing
with
the
problem
giving
all
interest
to
parties
full
due
process
rights.
the
broader
issue
before
this
court
and
it
can
only
be
made
before
this
court
is
whether
this
court
will
sanction
the
abrogation
of
the
doctrine
of
judicial
supremacy
which
i
have
been
taught
and
have
taught
others
to
believe
is
one
of
the
principle
doctrines
of
american
constitutional
law.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
except
the
fact
and
i
forget
now
how
many
diabetic
shocks
to
lumber
industries
has
had
in
this
regard
where
orders
of
various
kinds
have
been
issued
against
the
lumber
industry
by
reason
of
one
“emergency”
after
another.
now,
how
many
emergencies
make
an
emergency?
this
is
what
you're
up
against.
how
many
emergencies
do
you
have
to
have
before
you
had
a
chronic
situation
and
it's
my
contention,
your
honor,
that
when
you
have
an
emergency
that
existed
for
50
years
so
there
about
it's
not
an
emergency
anymore.
it's
a
--
it's
something
that
should
be
dealt
with
giving
the
input
of
the
industry
under
either
section
1(14)
or
section
15
which
allows
due
process
rights.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
this
is
not
the
basis
of
the
district
court
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
the
issue
of
emergency
was
not
raised
before
the
district
court
and
for
a
perfectly
good
reason.
i
had
two
cases
against
the
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
well,
that's
what
the
way
the
district
court,
i
believe,
however,
when
it
comes
up
to
this
court,
this
court
can
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
i
attack
the
order
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
i
did
not
bring
that
point
before
the
court
because
the
court
had
already
ruled
against
me
on
that
question
and
i
will
confess
it.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that's
right.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that's
correct
sir.
and
that
this
court
asked
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
the
history
and
the
cases
that
justice
rehnquist
wrote
and
i
have
cited
in
my
brief.
this
is
a
long
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
i
don't
think
it's
a
fact
finding.
i
think
this
court
has
already
held
that
there's
a
chronic
car
shortage,
justice
rehnquist
has
held
that,
has
stated
that.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
i
am
supporting
the
district
court's
conclusion
and
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that's
correct
sir.
i
say
that
i
have
two
strings
to
my
bowl.
i
believe
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
because
of
the
fact
that
it
affects
the
rates,
the
traditional
and
historic
way
in
which
car
service
order
have
been
enforced
and
except
for
the
two
orders
that
frankly
i
didn't
know
about
and
the
icc
didn't
know
about,
the
traditional
way
is
by
use
of
demurrage
charges
and
as
has
been
stated
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
it
increases
the
cost
to
the
shipper,
everything
increases
the
cost
to
the
shipper
or
to
ultimate
buyer
in
an
economic
sense.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
but
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that
this
is
what
the
intestate
commerce
commission
has
stated
as
i
point
out
in
my
record
and
in
the
affidavit
before
the
court
below,
there
are
many
economic
arguments
for
reconversion
and
for
the
practices
of
the
lumber
industry
and
the
lumber
industry
or
the
wholesale
lumber
industry
has
never
have
an
opportunity
to
submit
those
arguments
because
never
has
the
interstate
commerce
commission
taken
this
question
off
in
a
full
due
process
hearing.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
i
would
not
be
here
because
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that
is
correct.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that
--
what
it
does
is
it
splits
up
the
rate
from
a
through
and
joint
rate.
my
brief
and
the
affidavit
shows
that
in
some
cases
triples
the
rate
and
it's
grossly
aggravates
the
situation
rather
than
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that
is
true.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
the
difference
is
in
the
structure
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
interstate
commerce
act
only
gives
authority
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
emergency
action
in
the
case
of
rules
under
1(15).
justice
brandeis
in
the
pecan
case
which
i
have
cited
has
stated
that
1(15)
must
be
very
strictly
construed
and
that
it
is
only
traditional
and
at
that
time
it
was
traditional
only
to
enforce
rules
by
various
--
either
by
prohibitions
or
criminal
prohibition
or
by
in
some
cases
demurrage
charges.
now,
if
we
follow
justice
brandeis'
reasoning
that
this
in
effect
the
quasi-criminal
statute
and
since
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
this
particular
section
because
of
the
very
emergency
factor
involved
and
because
of
the
fact
that
it
does
a
way
with
due
process
must
be
strictly
construed.
therefore,
the
court
below
held
that
since
it
is
such
and
unusual
remedy
and
since
section
1(15)
does
not
give
that
remedy,
it
does
not
come
under
the
terms
of
section
1(15)
and
that's
the
difference
because
of
the
fact
that
in
one
case
due
process
is
granted
and
in
the
other
case
it
is
not.
the
commission
has
had
authority
under
section
49
u.s.c.
15
to
deal
with
this
problem
fo
50
years.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
no,
if
i
said
so
i
misspoke
myself
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
no
sir,
i
would
say
that
it
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
it
might
have
yes,
it
would
have
the
same
effect
in
the
sense
that
it
would
put
criminal
penalties
presumably,
your
honor,
that
there
have
to
be
some
penalties
of
some
kind.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that
is
correct
sir.
i
don't
know
exactly
--
i
can't
guess
what
penalty
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
in
some
cases,
they
imposed
fines
in
some
cases
they
imposed
jail
sentences
so
that
made
to
the
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
they
put
a
demurrage
charges
on
it.
that
is
true
sir
and
my
contention
is
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
except
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
except
the
fact
that
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
no,
it
might
not
be
or
if
it's
$10,000.00
a
day
i
assume
so
but
you
get
to
a
point
at
which
a
demurrage
charge
becomes
more
than
something
different
than
a
demurrage
charge.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that's
correct
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
so
that
you
come
down
to
a
question
i
suppose
a
question
of
degree
in
the
sense
that
when
in
a
demurrage
charge
usually
starts
at
$10.00
a
day
and
make
it
over
$20.00
or
$25.00,
$50.00
or
what
have
you
that
has
been
the
traditional
way
and
which
it's
done.
i
--
if
at
the
five
days
they
put
a
demurrage
charge
of
$1,500.00
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
a
day
which
i
suppose
is
something
the
commission
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that
is
correct
depending
upon
where
it
finally
winds
up.
a
demurrage
charge
would
be
uniform
but
let's
say
if
it
was
$1,500.00
a
day,
my
contention
then
would
be
and
i
think
would
be
justified
that
this
isn't
true
demurrage.
this
is
in
effect
a
change
of
quality
rather
than
purely
quantity.
at
some
point,
a
change
in
quantity
becomes
a
change
in
quality
and
my
contention
is
that
based
upon
the
way
in
which
this
order
was
designed
and
is
designed,
i'm
talking
specifically
with
1134.
it's
a
rate
order,
it's
designed
to
affect
the
rate
are
which
commodities
move,
rates
at
which
commodities
move
on
a
through
and
joint
rate
are
governed
by
section
49
u.s.c.
15.
section
49
u.s.c.
15
provides
due
process
rights.
section
1(15)
which
is
the
one
under
which
1134,
all
it
requires
under
the
--
under
its
word
is
that
“the
commission
is
of
the
opinion
that
and
emergency
requires”
is
required.
and
the
worst
part
about
that
is
that
several
courts
of
this
country
have
held
and
i've
cited
them,
the
dougherty
case
and
the
two
southern
railroad
cases
have
held
that
we
as
a
court
cannot
go
into
the
question
of
whether
the
opinion
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
it
is
not
justified
or
we
can
do
is
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
corrupt
to
arbitrary
or
some
other
thing.
now,
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
that
is
correct
sir.
that
is
exactly
so
and
the
reason
i
didn't
make
it
in
my
case
--
in
my
court
was
because
my
court
--
the
us
district
court
for
the
district
of
oregon
had
decided
the
dougherty
case,
and
as
an
advocate,
the
court
well
know
it
would
be
foolish
for
me
to
go
before
a
court
which
had
ruled
adversely
to
me
and
try
to
make
an
argument
which
they
have
ruled
adversely
to
me
on.
so,
i
had
--
i
took
another
argument
which
i
think
is
perfectly
valid
and
i
used
it.
now,
before
this
court
however
i'm
on
an
entirely
different
situation.
i
am
--
before
the
court
which
has
authority
for
the
whole
nation.
you
can
look
at
the
thing
as
a
whole,
you
can
look
at
it.
is
this
due
process
and
is
this
a
violation
of
due
process
and
are
we
violating
the
rule
of
judicial
supremacy
which
this
court
has
recently
upheld
in
us
versus
nixon?
are
we
violating
that
rule,
in
the
dougherty
case
and
in
the
two
southern
railway
cases
by
saying
that
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
yes
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
no,
i'm
arguing
that
the
whole
scheme
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
except
for
section
1(15)
provides
a
hearing
provides
all
the
administrative
procedures
which
allow
you
to
bring
before
the
commission
itself,
the
economic
arguments
on
behalf
of
the
industry.
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
and
i
have
never
really
thought
the
question
through
whether
or
not
an
interstate
commerce
act
which
did
not
provide
for
due
process
and
all
these
other
cases
would
be
struck
down
by
this
court.
this
court
has
never
been
faced
with
that
problem
because
the
history
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
been
that
if
any
thing
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
been
overly
solicitous
in
all
cases
except
under
1(15)
and
it's
this
exception
of
49
u.s.c
1(15)
that
i
am
here
complaining
about
particularly
as
used
in
this
case.
does
that
answer
the
court's
question?
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
i'm
making
a
statutory
argument
but
i
think
that
if
in
all
other
cases,
if
the
other
provisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
did
not
provide
due
process,
i
think
certainly
counsel
--
other
counsel
--
thank
you
sir.
other
counsel
would've
been
here
long
before
me
arguing
the
constitutional
question
and
i
would
not
be
here
possibly
arguing
the
constitutional
question.
now,
i
feel
it
--
before
this
court,
this
question
is
not
an
emergency.
how
long
do
you
have
a
situation
which
is
existed
admittedly
for
50
years
and
which
we
know
it's
going
to
exist
for
another
50
years
unless
a
complete
change
is
made?
how
can
the
interstate
commerce
commission
claim
that
it's
an
emergency
and
emergency
as
i
understand
is
based
upon
the
dictionary
definition
is
a
“sudden,
total
and
unexpected
event”.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
we
never
did
have
a
chance
to
litigate,
your
honor.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
this
is
true
but
we
never
get
a
chance
to
litigate.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
no,
i
cannot
because
under
the
dougherty
case
and
under
the
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
well,
i
can
raise
it,
your
honor,
but
i
can
raise
it
only
under
such
conditions
as
gives
me
no
chance
at
all.
it's
like
a
mexican
escape,
your
honor.
you
are
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
but
they
don't
renew
it
on
the
basis
of
every
four
years,
this
is
a
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
every
two
or
three
months.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
but
i
do
not
have
any
judicial
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
did
i
waive
it
sir?
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
a
waiver
is
when
a
person
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
well,
also
it's
when
you
have
a
choice.
i
had
no
choice.
a
waiver
is
a
situation
where
a
man
who
has
a
choice
between
a
and
b
intelligently
chooses
b.
i
had
no
choice
in
this
case
between
a
and
b
because
--
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
not
practically
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
yes
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
well,
this
court
is
unique,
i
must
say
that.
this
court
because
of
your
very
--
because
of
the
way
and
which
this
court
sits
and
because
of
your
very
unique
position
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
seymour
l.
coblens
thank
you
sir.
because
of
your
very
unique
position
in
the
american
history,
this
court
is
not
a
court,
it's
the
highest
court
of
political
decision
that
there
is
in
the
american
constitutional
system.
and
consequently,
you,
as
conditions
change
have
the
right
to
change
your
mind.
other
courts
do
not
have
that
right
and
don't
exercise
it.
thank
you,
sir.
