justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
white,
before
the
commission
entered
its
order
that's
on
appeal
here
supposing
that
you
put
lumber
in
a
boxcar
in
portland
and
consign
it
to
chicago
and
then
exercise
your
reconsignment
privilege
as
the
shipper
to
say
it
goes
back
to
denver
and
it's
all
them
at
least
sold
in
denver,
now,
what
rate
would
the
shipper
pay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
he
could
ship
it
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
it
ended
up
--
if
they
want
to
if
he
is
going
back
to
seattle
he
don't
--
he'd
pay
only
from
portland
to
seattle?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
somewhere
in
the
record,
mr.
white,
something
other
than
the
notations
at
page
17
of
the
appendix
which
indicates
that
the
original
expiration
date
was
may
15
or
july
31,
1973
some
indication
that
the
commission
has
renewed
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
the
commission
extend
the
order,
and
their
subsequent
order
as
extending
the
order?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
reason
why
the
commission
couldn't
have
a
sought
a
stay
from
this
court
after
the
three-judge
district
court
set
its
order
aside?
