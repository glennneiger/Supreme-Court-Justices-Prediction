justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
say
that
the
other
side
of
mr.
justice
white's
question
is
that
if
the
car
moves
within
the
designated
time,
the
rate
isn't
change
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
it
depends
on
how
we
look
at
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
white,
if
you
--
let
me
theorize
a
little
bit.
if
the
icc
didn't
have
this
emergency
power,
do
you
think
it
would
have
by
this
time
have
devised
some
solution
to
this
long
standing
chronic
problem?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
car
shortage.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
seems
lways
to
be
with
us
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
mr.
white,
following
through
a
little
on
this,
didn't
the
1134
by
its
terms
have
an
expiration
date?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
mean
half
months
in
duration
by
its
terms?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
unless
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
you
prevail
here
it
doesn't
go
automatically
back
into
effect
at
this
late
date?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let's
see
if
i
follow
that,
if
you
prevail
here
even
though
there's
been
no
extension
to
november
20,
1974,
it's
your
position
that
it
will
automatically
go
back
into
effect?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
has
that
appeared?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
isn't
in
the
record
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
isn't
in
the
appendix
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
white,
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
the
evidence
from
what
you
have
said
that
the
car
shortage
problem
is
chronic
although
you
suggest
that
this
particular
order
was
triggered
by
the
soviet
wheat
deal,
let's
assume
it
is
severely
chronic
and
that
this
practice
of
affording
what
in
effect
you've
characterize
as
storage
facilities
has
to
be
eliminated
or
modified
on
a
long
term
basis
not
just
an
order
of
60
or
90
days,
under
what
section
to
the
act
would
the
commission
proceeded
and
what
would
the
procedure
be?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
dependent
on
the
finding
of
emergency?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
apparently,
it
stayed,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
coblens,
in
that
connection,
suppose
the
commission
issued
an
order
just
stating
that
no
car
could
be
held
more
than
five
days
of
the
reconsignment
point
valid
without
a
hearing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
they
could
go
that
far?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you'd
have
no
objection?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
you're
really
arguing
now
is
that
even
if
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
calling
it
a
rate
order
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
is
the
car
service
order,
you
say
nevertheless
you're
entitled
to
an
affirmance
because
there's
no
emergency?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
do
we
have
before
us,
on
which
we
can
judge
whether
there
was
a
original
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
doesn't
triple
it
if
the
car
moves?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
doesn't
triple
it
if
the
car
moves.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
this
court
has
upheld
the
demurrage
charges
against
challenge
and
i
guess
what
i
want
and
i
think
that
mr.
justice
white
wants
is
what's
the
difference?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can't
you
say
the
exactly
the
same
thing
about
demurrage
charges
exactly
the
same
thing
and
further
i
thought
a
little
while
ago
you
had
conceded
that
if
the
commission
put
out
a
plain
bar
order
and
said
no
car
maybe
held
more
than
five
days,
this
should
be
all
right
without
due
process.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
in
this
case
you're
making
a
statutory
argument?
