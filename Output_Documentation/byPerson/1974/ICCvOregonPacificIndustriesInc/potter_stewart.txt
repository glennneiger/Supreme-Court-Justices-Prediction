when
was
that,
in
the
summer
of
1973?
justice
potter
stewart
the
stop
--
just
an
arbitrate
place
or
other
or
what,
how
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
they
moved
from
west
to
east
basically?
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
half
a
dozen
or
dozen
places
that
have
these
facilities?
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
are
the
midwest
somewhere?
justice
potter
stewart
demurrage
that
goes
progressively,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
so
much
a
day,
it's
so
much
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
gets
greater
per
day
as
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
has
the
number
of
days
increase?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
little
bit
of
bind
in
answering
that
question
of
my
brother
brennan,
didn't
you
stipulate
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
a
stipulation
that
there's
no
precedent?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
fact,
is
that
there
is
at
least
one
or
maybe
two
precedent,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
increases
the
cost.
this
has
been
pointed
out
only
if
the
order
doesn't
--
only
to
the
extent
that
the
purpose
of
the
order
is
not
achieved.
the
purposes
of
the
order
is
to
free
up
freight
cars
and
to
the
extent
it
does
to
the
extend
it
prevents
freight
cars
being
used
in
this
way
longer
than
five
days
then
it
doesn't
increase
much
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
because
of
those
cases
that
you
didn't
make
your
lack
of
emergency
argument
