justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
white,
what
are
the
problems
have
been
had
the
commission
elected
to
increase
the
demurrage
sufficiently
to
bring
back
the
same
result?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
went
to
a
lot
of
money,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
there
been
any
precedent
for
this
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
precedent
for
this
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
financing
on
that
i
gather
has
put
a
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
applies
uniformly?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
this
order
--
did
this
order
ever
come
effective?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
the
emergency
that
prompted
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
over,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
meant
the
grain
deal.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
emergency
that
created
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
independent
of
the
grain?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
white,
the
statute
of
course
confers
this
power
only
shortage
of
equipment
or
other
emergency
and
you
just
said
that
this
is
a
chronic
condition.
is
it
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
it's
chronic?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it's
a
never
ending
emergency,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
being
the
grain
--
that
the
grain
deal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
over?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what's
left
in
the
way
of
the
emergency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
nobody
know
that
then
if
you
prevail
here
what
happens
to
1134?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
but
if
you
prevail,
what
happens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
reinstated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don't
think
that
something
like
mootness
about
this
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
it
is
conceivable
that
demurrage
charge
could
be
the
equivalent
of
the
increase
rate,
couldn't
it
in
dollars?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
of
course
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
couldn't
be
--
i
mean
suppose
there
were
$100.00
a
day
demurrage
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
a
day?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
demurrage
charge
will
have
to
be
uniform
the
way
this
rate
thing
works
some
--
i
gather
some
shippers
pay
according
to
these
examples
thousands
dollars
more
of
the
300
more
other
600.
