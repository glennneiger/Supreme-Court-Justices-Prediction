e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
73-1210,
interstate
commerce
commission
against
oregon
pacific
industries.
mr.
white,
you
may
proceed
whenever
youâ€™re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
shippers
sometimes
in
effect
use
the
demurrage
as
storage
cost,
in
fact,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
past
three
years,
we've
had
three
or
four
years,
we've
had
two
or
three
car
shortage
cases
here
before
us,
have
we
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
emergency
situations
stemming
from
other
factors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
said
car
shortage
problem
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there's
nothing
unique
about
a
car
shortage
problem
in
this
country
from
time
to
time,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
sometimes
we
have
the
cars
but
we
have
them
in
places
where
they
aren't
needed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
your
answer
to
be
that
there
has
been
a
chronic
shortage
for
some
time
but
this
was
an
extraordinary
emergency.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
supply
the
clerk
with
copies
and
of
course
your
friend
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
would
that
make
any
difference
if
in
fact
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
is
there
an
overlook?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
give
a
hypothesis
as
to
how
long
that
due
process
might
take
the
kind
of
due
process
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
not
that
we
measure
due
process
by
time
when
we're
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
confronted
with
an
emergency
that
does
enter
into,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
understand
your
friend's
argument
on
this
matter
of
a
chronic
condition
related
to
an
emergency,
it's
perhaps
vaguely
analogous
to
a
person
who
has
diabetes
which
is
chronic
but
goes
into
diabetic
shock
perhaps
from
time
to
time
and
perhaps
he
analogize
this
immediate
situation
to
a
diabetic
shock
which
cause
for
something
ordinary
--
something
other
than
ordinary
treatment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
we
going
to
fact
--
are
we
going
to
be
fact
finders
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
judges
never
changed
their
minds
about
some
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we've
all
tried
it
and
sometimes
exceeded,
haven't
we
in
practice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we,
even
here
we
change
our
minds
sometimes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
may
finish
your
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
73-1210,
interstate
commerce
commission
against
oregon
pacific
industries,

opinion

on
behalf
of
mr.

douglas.
and

reasons
stated

states
district
court
