justice

white
and
in
any
event
there
is
no
list
that
the
rate
--
the
rate
--
the
basis,
changes
on
the
fifth
day?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
charge
--
you
charge
some
of
the
individual
rates
rather
than
the
joint
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
true
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
in
the
tariff?
justice
byron
r.
white
rates
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
essential
to
extend
the
car
service
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
emergency
still
exists?
justice
byron
r.
white
though
it's
been
extended
every
two
or
three
months
since
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
whole
series
of
extension?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
the
court
--
what
did
the
district
court
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
order
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
not
in
the
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
agree
that
the
commission
had
going
for
the
procedure
of
extending
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
each
time
asserting
an
emergency?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
the
basis
the
district
court
went
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
district
court
said
that
you
know
it's
an
emergency
and
it
seems
to
accept
that
fact
that
it
was,
it
isn't
a
car
service
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
question
is
whether
it's
a
car
service
order
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
assert
in
the
district
court?
you
attacked
the
order,
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
it
wasn't
an
emergency?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask
you,
are
you
supporting
the
district
court's
conclusion?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
the
reasons
that
it
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
is
not
a
car
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
again
why
this
isn't
a
car
service
order
but
a
rate
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
increases
the
cost
to
the
shipper?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
unfortunately,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
--
but
if
this
were
just
a
demurrage
in
short
putting
a
uniform
charge
daily
charges
or
something
like
that
for
holding
a
car
too
long,
you
wouldn't
--
you
probably
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
puts
a
very
different
charge
on
different
shippers
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
depending
on
what
the
rate
structure?
so,
the
extra
charges
depended
upon
a
rate
rather
than
a
demurrage
some
uniform
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
wouldn't
--
you
wouldn't
say
it
was
a
great
order,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
be
to
the
effect
it
would
have
the
same
effect,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
rate
or
the
commission
unless
the
commission
said
the
line
“all
rates
would
apply”
--
the
individual
rates
would
apply
as
the
individual
rate
wouldn't
apply
did
at
least
with
the
car
order.
here,
they
went
on
and
said
the
individual
rates
will
apply
not
the
through
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
case,
do
so
when
they
say
no
more
than
five
days
they
put
the
demurrage
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here,
if
they
hold
it
one
day
too
long
it
cost
let's
say
the
example
of
$1,500.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
$7,500.00
a
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
while
the
commission
in
here
apparently
suggests
to
you
that
if
the
district
court
is
reversed
on
the
car
service
as
against
rate
order
issue
then
the
commission
is
going
to
--
you're
going
to
have
some
chance
to
litigate
before
the
commission
again
with
respect
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
they
still
have
to
decide
each
time
whether
there's
an
emergency.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
you
can't
even
litigate
and
you
can
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
can
raise
it,
you
may
lose,
you'll
see
if
you
lose.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
someone
renews
an
order
every
three
or
four
months
for
three
or
four
years
that
on
the
basis
of
an
emergency,
it
doesn't
sound
much
like
the
case
you're
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
every
two
or
three
months.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
said.
