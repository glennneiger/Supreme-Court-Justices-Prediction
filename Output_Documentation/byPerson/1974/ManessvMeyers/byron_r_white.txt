what
should've--
what
should
a
judge
do
in
a
civil
proceeding
when
a
witness
takes
the
fifth
amendment
and
says
he
won't
answer
the
question
and
the
judge
considers
it
and
says
“well,
this
just
happens
to
be
within
the
area
that
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
and
i
direct
you
to
answer
the
question.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
witness
says
“i'm
awfully
sorry.
i
won't
do
it.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
lawyer
who
says
“now,
you
go
ahead
and
refuse
to
answer”?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you,
was
the
judge--
if
the
judge
rules
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
not
available
in
a
certain
context
which
is
being
claimed
by
a
party
or
a
witness
and
insists
that
a
subpoena
be
complied
with
or
an
answer
be
given
to
a
question
and
the
lawyer
advices
the
client
not
to
answer,
do
you
suggest
that
he--
that
the
lawyer--
neither
the
lawyer
nor
the
client
is
in
contempt
of
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
the
client's
in
contempt
of
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and--
but,
the
lawyer
is
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
suppose
that
the
client
at
that
very
moment
had
the
right
to
challenge
the
judge's
ruling
or
appeal.
instead
of
disobeying,
he
could
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
chooses
not
to
appeal
but
disobeys.
the
situation
would
be
different,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that,
the
only
way
to
test
the
judge's
ruling
was
to
be
in
contempt
and
then
have
the
challenge
under
the
fifth
amendment
ruled
on
as
part
of
the
contempt
procedure.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there--
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
motion
to--
there
was
a
subpoena
issued
for
magazines
and
then
there
was
a
motion
to
quash,
was
there
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
what
was
argued
before
the
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
was
also--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
also
asserted
fifth
amendment,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
overruled
the
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
under
texas
procedure,
could
that
motion
have--
could
that
decision
have
been
appealed?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
was
no
remedy
at
that
point
to
protect
the
materials
claimed
to
be
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
except
not
produce
them
and
argued
out
in
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
was
there
or
wasn't
there
some
other
remedy?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
motion
denied
the
denial.
the
motion
couldn't
be
appealed
under
texas
procedure.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
know
whether
or
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
know
whether
or
not
mandamus
was
available.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
client
said--
is
told
to
produce
this
second
time,
as
you
say,
and
he
says
“may
i
talk
to
my
attorney?”
the
judge
says
“alright,”
and
he
talks
to
his
attorney
and
he
asks
his
attorney
“is
the
judge
right,”
and
the
attorney
says
“well,
in
my
judgment,
he's
wrong.”
“well,
how
can
we
test
it,”
and
the
attorney
says
“just
refuse
to
answer
him.
we'll
test
it
out
on
contempt
proceeding,
but
you're
going
to
be
held
in
contempt
but
if
you
want
to
test
it
out,
i
advise
you
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
not--
the
only
way
you
can
test
it
out
is
to
refuse
to
produce,
but
we
can
test
it
out
that
way.”
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything--
that
would
be
a
rather
normal
conversation,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
the
trial
judge
indicated
that
it
would
be.
at
page
11
of
the
petitioner's
brief
there's
a
colloquy.
i
think
that's
what
it
means.
the
trial
court
said
“which
could
have
been
reached
by
a
motion
to
suppress
that
evidence
or
by
an
objection
to
an
attempt
to
introduce
it.”
now,
i
don't
know
what
law
the
trial
court
was
relying
on,
but
if--
i
take
it
that's
what
he
was
referring
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
in
effect,
the
judge's
ruling
sustained
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
so
that
if
he
hadn't
been--
if
he
had
turned
the
magazines
over,
he
could
never
have
had
that
review
because
he
never
would've
been
held
in
contempt.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
there
a
normal
procedure
in
texas
for
granting
immunity
where
the
state
wants
testimony
that
explain
in
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
normally,
the
prosecutor
or
the
judge
or
somebody
has
to
make
it
clear
to
the
witness
or
the
party
that
that
removes
the
danger.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
should've--
what
should
a
judge
do
in
a
civil
proceeding
when
a
witness
takes
the
fifth
amendment
and
says
he
won't
answer

and
the

says
“well,

that

doesn't
apply
to
and
i
direct
you
to
answer
the
question.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
witness
says
“i'm
awfully
sorry.
i
won't
do
it.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
lawyer
who
says
“now,
you
go
ahead
and
refuse
to
answer”?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask

do
you
suggest
that
he--
that
the
lawyer--
neither
the
lawyer
nor
the
client
is
in
contempt
of
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
the
client's
in
contempt
of
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and--
but,
the
lawyer
is
not.
justice
byron

let's

so

it
was

it
also
asserted
fifth
amendment,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judge
overruled
the
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
under
texas
procedure,
could
that
motion
have--
could
that
decision
have
been
appealed?
justice
byron

so
there

was
there
or
wasn't
there
some

justice
byron

but
the

denied
the

the

couldn't
be

under

justice
byron

and
