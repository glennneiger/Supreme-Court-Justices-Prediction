justice

is
there
an

from
judge

justice

blackmun
mr.
dibrell,
let
me
see
if
your
position
is
what
i
think
it
is.
i
take
it
you
have
conceded
all
along
that
this
mr.
maness
could
advice
his
client
initially
to
take
the
fifth
and
then,
the
court
having
ruled,
i
take
it
you
feel
that
what
he
should
advice
the
client
is,
“in
my
judgment
you
have
the
right
to
take
the
fifth
but,
if
you
do,
you
may
go
to
jail
but
i,
as
a
lawyer,
have
to
advise
you
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
court.”
isn't
this
essentially
what
you're
saying
at
this
point?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
that,
i
take
it,
you
feel
is
different
than
to
persist
in
advising
the
client
to
take
the
fifth.
