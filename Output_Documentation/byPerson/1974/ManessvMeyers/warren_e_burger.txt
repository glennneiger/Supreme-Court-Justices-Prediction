arguments

against

chief

warren
e.
burger
there
are
cases,
are
there
not?
there'd
been
a
number
of
them--
of
witnesses
in
a
civil
action,
either
parties
or
independent
witnesses,
refusing
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
to
respond
to
questions.
chief

you
can
enlarge
on
that
answer
after

you
want.
chief

e.

mr.

you
may
continue.
you
have
about
19
minutes
of
your
time
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
either
get
a
stay
of
that
or
habeas

chief
justice
warren

did
he
find
him
or
did
he
just
wash

case
out?
chief

warren
e.
burger
mr.
walsh--
excuse
me,
go
ahead.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
cast
it
in
that
form,
of
course
it
at
least
doesn't
give
me
difficulty,
but
let
me
suggest
a
hypothetical
case
to
you,
just
an
ordinary
civil
lawsuit,
personal
injury
or
whatever.
an
accounting
case
and
you
have
a
witness,
not
a
party.
a
party
who
refuses
to
answer,
the
court
has
many
sanctions.
he
can
either
dismiss
the
case
of
the
plaintiff
or
he--
defense
counsel
can
exploit--
the
plaintiff's
counsel
can
exploit
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
argument
if
it's
the
defendant,
so
later
decide
it's
a
third-party
witness
and
the
third-party
witness
refuses
to
answer
on
the
grounds
of
self-incrimination.
is
the
court
at
that
point
absolutely
bound
or
can
the
court
make
some
inquiry
into
the
good
faith
of
the
assertion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let's
move
to
his
lawyer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let's
move
to
his
lawyer
as
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
answer
of
the
witness
is
that,
on
advice
of
counsel
naming
him,
he
declines
to
answer
for
his
reasons.
if
you
can
hypothesize
a
situation
where
the
claim
is,
on
its
face,
utterly
frivolous
and
unfounded
and,
here,
you're
in
the
middle
or
in
the
process
of
a
trial
which
might
have
to
be
declared
a
mistrial
as
a
result,
there
might
be
many
untoward
results.
is
the
court
totally
without
power
to
deal
with
that
situation,
other
than
contempt
of
the
witness
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
must
be
against--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
move
against
the
witness
and
not
against
the
client.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
a
later--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
take
disciplinary
action
or
refer
it.
depending
on
the
rules
of
the
jurisdiction,
refer
it
to
the
proper
body.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
independent
of
the
case
and
independent
of
any
contempt
proceeding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
matter
sought
to
be
produced
was
the
subject
of
the
criminal
procedure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
walsh.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dibrell.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
that
order
had
been
directed,
as
i
think
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
to
a
question
subpoenaed
to
the
witness
while
he
was
on
the
stand
in
the
course
of
trial
and
he
declined
to
answer
on
the
ground
the
response
might
tend
to
incriminate
him.
would
you
think
the
lawyer
could
be
held
in
contempt
for
so-advising
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
normal?
isn't
that
the
ordinary
route
to
test
it
as
it
is
under
the
federal
system
or
under
rule
17?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
that
could
be
subject
to
a
motion
to
suppress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
his
possession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
grounds
that
he
was
compelled
to
produce
it
against
his
will.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that's
enough
protection?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
established
law
that
you
could
suppress
in
those
circumstances
in
texas?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
find
that,
sometimes,
some
of
these
things
are
not
always
followed
in
the
state
court
so--
but
my
question
is
in
texas,
in
a
state
court
proceeding,
is
it
accepted
law
that
the
involuntary
production
would
enable
him
to
suppress
it
as
evidence
in
a
subsequent
criminal
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
isn't
perhaps
quite
enough
for
the
man
to
know
that,
ultimately,
in
the
federal
court
he
might
be
vindicated
if,
in
fact,
it
would
be
incriminating
to
him
or
tend
to
be
incriminating
in
the
state
court
system.
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then,
doesn't
that
tender
give
some
color
of
validity
to
the
lawyer's
advice?
if
you
can't
answer,
that
it
is
established
texas
law
that
that
would
be
subject
to
a
motion
to
suppress,
and
with
a
successful
outcome,
and
doesn't
that
justify
the
lawyer
telling
him
not
to
produce?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
if
the
lawyer
had
said
to
the
client
exactly
what
you've
just
said
to
the
court
that
“i
think,”
if
the
client
in--
during
a
recess
then
asked
him
the
question
and
he
said
“i
think
that
i
can't
cite
any
case
that
it
will
be
subject
to
motion
to
suppress”?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
these
circumstances.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he's
saying
that
it
would
be
reached.
does
that
mean--
is
that
an
assurance
that
it
would
be--
when
reached,
it
would
granted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
sorry
to
track
over
it
again,
but
this
judge's
statement
at
page
11
of
your
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
right
near
at
the
top
of
the
page
where
the
court
said
“referring
to
the

the
compulsory

that

could
have
been
reached
by
a
motion
to
suppress
that
evidence
or
by
an
objection
to
an
attempt
to
introduce
it.”
now,
you
say
that
you
can't
cite
any
case
in
which
the
texas
courts
have
held
that
it--
that
motion
would
be
successful
because
of
a
compulsion
exerted
by
the
power
of
the
subpoena.
is
the
court
saying
any
more
than
pointing
out
the
standard
routine
remedy,
you
can
always
make
a
motion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what's
the
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment
incrimination
clause?
does
it
mean
that
you
can
only
use
it
if
you
are
certain
to
be
convicted
of
something
or
does
it
mean
that
you
can
assert
the
fifth
amendment
right
if
it
will
expose
you
to
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
doesn't
quite
answer
my
question.
in
texas,
as
you--
as
the
texas
courts
apply
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution,
is
it
necessary
to
show,
in
order
to
assert
it
successfully,
that
you
are
bound
to
be
convicted
or
is
it
enough
to
show
that
you
are
likely
to
be
prosecuted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assume--
let's
alter
our
facts
a
little.
assume
that
there
was
no
criminal
proceeding
pending
in
this
case
and
he
declined
to
produce
on
the
advice
of
counsel
who
said
if
you
do
produce
them,
you
are
very
likely
to
be
prosecuted.
would
that
be
a--
would
you
regard
that
as
a
good--
a
valid
claim
that
should
be
recognized
by
the
texas
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
dibrell.
