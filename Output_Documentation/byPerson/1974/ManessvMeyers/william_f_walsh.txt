mr.
william
f.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
$500
fine
from
a
texas
district
court
and,
in
that
context,
it
is
obviously
not
an
important
case
and
that
is
obviously
not
why
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
importance
of
this
case
is
that
it
involves
the
very
independence
of
the
american
bar
to
give
free
untrammeled
legal
advice
to
a
client
who
has
the
right,
should
he
choose
to
do
so,
to
follow
it
or
disregard
it.
now,
i
think
perhaps
i
should
make
it
clear.
i
think
it's
been
made
clear
in
the
briefs
and
i
know
the
court
has
seen
them.
there
is
no
allegation
or
suggestion
or
suspicion
that
mr.
maness,
who
is
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
and
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and,
of
course,
the
texas
supreme
court
and
so
on,
was
in
any
way
contumacious
in
any
personal
sense
to
the
trial
court.
actually,
there
were
three
lawyers
involved
in
this
case,
a
mr.
friedman
who
is
unfortunately
now
deceased
and
a
mr.
maley
who
may
presently
be
in
the
courtroom.
i
don't
know
whether
he
is,
but
three
lawyers
gave
sincere
legal
advice
that
this
particular
client
did
not
have
to
produce
certain
documents
which,
the
state
contended,
were
incriminatory.
and,
it
is
simply
a
case
of
a
lawyer
being
punished
for
giving
advice
on
a
federal
constitutional
right,
and
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about.
now,
we
have
had
a
tradition
in
this
country,
since
certainly
adams
represented
the
british
soldiers
in
the
boston
massacre,
of
lawyers
at
least
being
allowed
to
represent
and
advice
their
clients
and
that
tradition
is
about
to
be
destroyed
if
this
contempt
citation
stands
up,
and
that
is
the
importance
of
the
case.
fortunately,
it
has--
had
already
been
decided
once.
i
think
perhaps
the
value
of
my
presentation
to
you
is
perhaps
in
discussing
the
facts
rather
than
the
law
because
the
law
has
been
completely
discussed
in
our
briefs.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
case
has
already
been
decided
by
the
united
states
district
court.
if
you
will
examine
appendix
c
in
our
brief
on
the
merits,
beginning
at
page
74,
you
will
find
the
opinion
of
judge
roberts
in
austin
dealing
with
mr.
maley
who
was
co-counsel
in
the
case
and
it's
a
white
horse
situation.
there's
no
difference
between
the
cases.
it
simply
was
a
choice
of
remedies.
mr.
maley
chose
to
go
the
habeas
corpus
route
through
the--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
no,
mr.
maness
chose
to
come
to
the
supreme
court
because
he
felt
that
it
was
important
enough
that
this
court
decide
it.
it
so
happens,
your
honor,
that
both
remedies
are
available.
you
could
go
the
habeas
corpus
route
or
the
certiorari
route.
and,
it
was
mr.
maness'
feeling,
very
strongly,
that
the
case
is
important
enough
to
be
decided
by
this
court
and
i
might--could
he
go
to
judge
roberts
now?
mr.
william
f.
walsh
sir?
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
i
don't
know
that
he
could,
having
come
here,
but
judge
roberts
has
decided
mr.
maley's
case
and
decided
it
in
what
i
think
is
a
simple
lucid
short
opinion
that
is
obvious
that
a
lawyer
has
a
right
to
tell
someone
that,
in
his
opinion,
you
have
a
right
to
exercise
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
it's
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
and
the
fifth
circuit
is
holding
it
in
the
bench
pending
this
court's
decision
of
mr.
maness'
case.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
you
understand
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution
pending.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
separately
from
this.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
but
had
the
evidence
been
made
available
in
the
civil
proceeding,
it
obviously
would've
been
available
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
your
honor,
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
yes,
i
would
contend
that.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
a
citizen
in
any
case
has
a
constitutional
right,
if
he's
employed
counsel,
to
have
a
lawyer
working
for
him.
but,
you
must
remember
that
there
was
pending
a
criminal
case
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
and
that
the
lawyer's
focus
was
as
much
concerned
with
that
pending
criminal
case
as
it
was
with
the
civil
case
which
became
the
genesis
of
this
action.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
this
was
a
civil
proceeding
alleging
the
commission
of
a
criminal
offense
and,
i
might
add
this,
at
this
particular
day,
according
to
my
latest
information
from
granted
certiorari
law
week
and
so
on.
this
court
has
before
it,
either
having
granted
certiorari
or
applications
for
certiorari,
some-26
cases
involving
pornography
and
obscenity,
and
i
think
for
a
lawyer
in
the
middle
of
a
trial
when
this
court
itself
has
had
considerable
difficulties
through
the
years
in
determining
the
limits
and
bound
of
what
is
right
and
what
is
proper,
with
this
court
having
some-26
cases
before
it
right
now,
for
a
lawyer
working
in
a
texas
town
to
do
anything
except
suggest
to
a
client
that
he
ought
to
exercise
his
rights
against
self-incrimination
i
think
would
probably
be
negligence.
now,
i--
we
have
briefed
it
in
some
detail
the
merits
of
the
actual
defense
of
mckelva--
i
mean,
the
merits
of
his
refusal
to
produce
the
information
called
for
by
the
subpoenee
and
by
the
court
order.
and,
the
only
reason
we've
done
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
my
client
who
is
a
citizen-member
of
this
bar,
we've
had
some
disagreements
about
the
matter
but
the
only
reason
we've
done
it
is
simply
to
assure
this
court
that
the
advice
is
given
in
good
faith
that
it
wasn't
just
an
effort
to
avoid
legal
process
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
the
simple
remedy
for
that
and
the
remedy
that
was
presented
by
this
case
and
really
becomes
the
funny
feature
of
this
case
is
that,
of
course,
the
state
district
judge
has
the
right.
mr.
mckelva
having
received
his
advice
from
his
three
lawyers,
mr.
mckelva
had
the
right
to
disregard
the
court's
order
and,
thereby,
be
put
in
jail
for
contempt.
and
then,
it
could've
been
tested
by
habeas
corpus.
in
this
case,
it
was
tested
by
habeas
corpus.
judge
roberts
issued
a
writ
for
mr.
mckelva
and,
the
minute
the
state
judge
learned
that
the
federal
court
had
entertained
and
granted
the
writ
to
bring
him
into
the
federal
court,
the
state
judge
called
mr.
mckelva
over
from
the
county
jail
and
said
“i'm
going
to
let
you
go.
your
behavior
has
been
very
good
and
you
may
be
released.”
and,
of
course,
mooted
the
only
traditional
way
of
handling
this
case.
i
don't
think
this
court
can
find
a
case.
we've,
i
think,
done
a
decent
job
of
research
and
i
don't
think
this
court
can
find
a
case
where
a
lawyer's
been
put
in
jail
for
giving
non-contumacious
advice
just
because
a
judge
happens
to
think
that
it's
contrary
to
what
he
wants
done.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
you
want
to
know
if
it
was
going
to
be
the
same.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
erroneous,
yes.
good
faith
is
the
question.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
i'm
entitled
to
make
mistakes
in
my
practice
of
law
without
going
to
jail.
now,
if
i'm
arguing
a
proposition
to
you
which
is
not
in
good
faith,
if
i'm
trying
to
kid
the
court,
this
court
or
the
court
in
tyler,
that's
another
kettle
of
fish
and,
quite
frankly,
i
might
take
a
somewhat
different
position
in
that
event.
but,
so
long
as
the
legal
advice
is
in
fact
given
in
good
faith
and,
as
i
say,
in
this
case
we
have
tried
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
there
are
good
faith
grounds
for
believing
that
the
advice
was
correct.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
you
have--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that's
exactly
what
the--
put
the
man
in
jail
for
contempt
of
court
and
then,
in
texas,
we
would
have
a
right
to
litigate
the
legality
of
the
confinement
and
the--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
sir,
my
light
is
on
but
let
me
say
this.
the
record--
the
appendix
clearly
shows
and
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
lawyers
did
not
advice
him
to
ignore
any
court
order.
they
simply
advised
him
what
they
thought
his
legal
rights
were.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
if
i
may,
your
honor--[luncheon
break]
mr.
william
f.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
asked
the
martial
to
divide
my
time
in
half
so
that
i
may
have
some
time
for
rebuttal,
and
i
just
have
a
few
more
remarks
i
wish
to
make
to
the
court
at
this
time.
first,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
if
michael
maness
is
guilty
of
contempt
of
court
for
advising
a
client
about
his
fifth
amendment
rights,
this
court
ought
to
summon
mr.
sinclair
back
for
advising
president
nixon
not
to
surrender
those
tapes
and
hold
him
in
contempt
of
court.
this
is
a
perfect
situation
of
a
lawyer
giving
pro--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
no,
i
didn't
suggest
that
the
client
was
not.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
this
court
has
decided
that
very
question
in
ryan
versus
united
states
in
the
fall
of
the
second--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
no,
i
think
the
lawyer
has
the
right
to
give
free
and
untrammeled
advice
under
any
circumstances
as
long
as
it's
an
honest
professional--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
i
would
be
making
a
quite
different
argument
if
that
were
the
case
but,
under
the
texas
law
as
it
applies
to
this
particular
case,
there
was
no
way
to
do
that.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that
is
correct,
sir,
but--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
your
honor,
the
lawyers
attempted
to
obtain
habeas
corpus
relief
from
both
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
both
of
which
denied
relief.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
they
then
went
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
texas
which
granted
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and,
the
minute
the
federal
court
granted
the
writ,
the
state
judge
released
the
prisoner,
thereby,
mooting
the
whole
case.
well,
is
there
any--
sir?
mr.
william
f.
walsh
he
just
washed
it
off.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
mr.
zwiener
and
mr.
dibrell
can
answer
that,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
such
dispute.
am
i
correct?
if
you
would,
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
way
to
do
it.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
that's
all,
your
honor.
i
just
do
want
to
suggest
that
this--
before
i
turn
this
over
to
my
friends
at
the
attorney
general's
office,
i
do
want
to
suggest
that
we
are
toying
here
with
the
right
of
a
free
american
lawyer
to
give
free
and
untrammeled
legal
advice
to
a
person
who's
in
trouble.
and,
that
is
what
is
really
involved
in
this
case
and
i
hope
the
court
will
recognize
it
in
deciding
it.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
can
hold
the
witness
in
contempt
and
let
the
witness
exercise
his
right
to
habeas
corpus
and
the
other
relief
which
is
available,
which
is
precisely
what
this
court
decided
in
ryan.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
sir?
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
frankly,
i
am
not
briefed
to
discuss
that
but
my
answer
would
be,
just
having
briefed
the
rest
of
this
case,
my
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
hold
the
witness
in
contempt.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
am
willing
to
concede,
your
honor,
that
there
are
peculiar
circumstances
that
i
can
conceive
of
where
the
lawyer's
advice
would
be
so
frivolous
that
perhaps
the
court
could
take
disciplinary
action,
but
i
don't
think
by
way
of
contempt.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
the
way
would
be
through
the
grievance
procedure
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
that
happens
to
be
my
opinion.
i--
as
i
say,
that
we're
not
involved
in
that
here.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
this
man
was
under
a
criminal
accusation
at
the
time
and
it
happened
to
arise
in
the
context
of
a
civil
action,
but
he
was
under
a
pending
existing
criminal
action
at
the
time.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir,
and
was
contraband.
the
state
has
cited
dibella
in
its
briefing.
now,
the
material
in
dibella's
case
was
not
contraband.
in
this
case,
if
the
state
was
correct
in
its
contention
that
it
was
contraband,
it,
seems
to
me,
raise
some
slow
couture
that
the
man
has
the
right
to
refuse
to
produce
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
yes.
i
would
say
it's
different
because
of
the
pendency
of
the
criminal
proceedings
against
this
man,
but
i
would
go
a
little
further.
first,
if
the
client
wishes
to
follow
his
lawyer's
advice,
if
the
lawyer
says
“don't
answer
that
question,
i
don't
care
what
the
judge
says,”
if
he
chooses
to
follow,
he
goes
to
jail
and
that
may
be
tested
in
the
proper
appellate
remedy,
as
is
suggested
in
ryan.
now,
just
a
moment,
your
honor,
the
next
thing
is
that
it
is
totally
frivolous
information
that
the
lawyer
has
given
the
client
if
it
is
stupid
advice.
we
do
have
laws
involving
malpractice.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
and
the
client
has
remedy
against
the
lawyer.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that's
all
that's
involved
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
am
drawing
a
sharp
enough
distinction
so
that
i
am
willing
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
because
it
isn't
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
so.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
not
in--
completely
free
from
the
subject
on
which
he
is
advising.
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
so
at
all.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
do.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
the
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
it
is
the
constitutional
right,
for
instance,
to
a
jury
trial
and
anything
above
it
more
than
$20.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that
involves
the
constitutional
right
to
have
counsel
represent
you.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
i
would
be
prepared
to
contend
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
encompasses
the
right
to
trial
back
to
the
right
to
assistance
of
counsel
in
civil
courts.
if
you
happen
to
have
counsel
and
he's
there
and,
as
these
lawyers
were,
whether
you
have
the
right
to
appointed
counsel,
as
we
do
in
criminal
cases,
is
another
kettle
of
fish
but,
certainly,
if
you
have
a
lawyer
there
and
he
gives
you
the
advice
and
you
follow
it,
i
think
that's
your
risk
and
your
remedy
is
against
the
lawyer.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
he
can
put
the
client
in
jail.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
i
have
seen
one
case
in
my
own
home
federal
district
where
the
lawyer's
asserted
a
claim
of
privileges
to
a
communication
that
was
made
to
them
by
the
clients
and
judge
connelly
took
the
position
“fine,
i
can
hold
you
in
contempt
of
court
if
you
don't
answer
the
question,”
and
he
said
“if
you're
right,
you
can
revert,”
but
you
understand
this
is
the
lawyer
directly
claiming
a
privilege
of
his
own.
this
is
not
advising
a
client
as
we
have
in
this
case,
and
judge
connelly's
position
was
“well,
i'm
going
to
hold
you
in
contempt
and
if
you
win
in
the
supreme
court
or
the
fifth
circuit
or
anywhere
else,
that's
fine
but
i'm
not
going
to
reduce
the
sentence
at
the
end
of
120
days,
but
that's
a
different
situation.
no,
i
think
the
lawyer
has
a
certain
degree
of
immunity
and
i
think
it's
up
to
this
court
to
protect
it.
the--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
your
honor,
i
would
hope
that
i
would
advise
him
to
appeal
the
injunction.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
it--
your
honor,
if
there
was
judicial
relief
available,
it
would
be
a
different
kettle
of
fish.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
but,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
judicial
relief
available.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
it's
an
important
point.
whether
it
is
critical
or
not,
i
don't
know,
but
it
certainly
is
an
important
issue
and
i
agree
with
you
that
the
court
needs
to
consider
it.
but,
the
fact
remains
that,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
relief
available
other
than
the
relief
that
was
actually
granted
by
the
united
states
district
judge
and
was,
thereafter,
mooted
by
the
state
judge
when
he
realized
that
it
was
going
to
get
into
federal
court,
and
that
is
the
peculiar
reason
for
this
whole
case.
i
would
like
very
much
to
keep
some
of
my
time
and,
unless
the
court
has
other
questions,
and
turn
it
over
to
my
friends
in
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
very
little,
your
honor.
i'll
just
say
this.
every
time
i
have
to
be
down
at
the
police
station
at
midnight
and
tell
a
client
“by
george!
you
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
talk
to
the
police,”
i
guess
i
am
obstructing
justice
if
that
is
within
the
meaning
of
what
our
friends
from
the
state
say,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
advice
given
in
this
case
was
obviously
sound.
it
was
obviously
founded
on
careful
pleadings.
it,
i
think,
is
totally
sustained
by
our
briefs
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
key
issue
in
this
case.
i
think
the
key
issue
is
the
right
of
the
lawyer
to
give
advice,
and
this
court
in
ryan
has
made
it
very
clear
that
there's
a
conventional,
easy,
simple
way
to
pursue
this
matter
and
handle
it.
and,
in
answer
to
the
question
that
was
asked
from
the
bench,
first,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
at
page,
i
believe
it's
41,
yes
of
the--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
of
the
appendix,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
simply
denied
the
motion
for
relief
to
file
the
application
for
habeas
corpus
as
to
mckelva.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
did
the
same,
and
both
of
those
notations
are
at
page
41
of
the
appendix.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
they
moved
fast,
your
honor,
and
did
everything
they
could
for
their
client.
but,
they
then
received
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
from
judge
roberts,
and
it
was
on
that
day,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
while
they
were
hand-carrying
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
from
judge
roberts
to
the
state
district
court,
he
apparently
learned
of
it
through
some
informal
way
which
we
honestly
do
not
know
and
he
had
the
man
brought
over
from
the
county
jail
and
dismissed
the
charge
against
him.
and,
of
course,
that
mooted
the
federal
habeas
corpus
for
the--
as
to
the
client.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
he
was
in
contempt
of
court,
your
honor.
i'm
unsure
how--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
and
that
was
what
was
given
the
lawyers
too.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
the
reviewing
judge--
as
mr.
dibrell
has
said,
the
reviewing
judge
changed
the
jail
sentences
to
the
lawyer
as
to
both
mr.
maley
and
mr.
maness
to
a
$500-fine
but,
of
course,
on
non-payment
of
the
fine
they're
subject
to
going
to
jail.
and,
there
is
a--
what
i
think
is
a
perfectly
sound
opinion
from
judge
roberts.
it
is
exhibit
c
on
the
brief
on
the
merits.
judge
roberts
is
from
texas.
he
knows
what
goes
on
and
how
it
goes
on
and,
quite
frankly,
i
don't
think
this
court
could
do
any
better
than
to
simply
adopt
judge
roberts'
opinion
as
to
both
parties.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
no,
judge
roberts,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
it's,
i
believe,
exhibit
c.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
at
page
74
of
our--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
and--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
we
have
several
independent
statutes
on
immunity
in
various
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
yes
and,
furthermore,
i
might
point
out
that
the
idea
that
mr.
dibrell
suggested
to
the
court
i
have
crow
with
it.
i
think
chief
justice
burger
had
his
fingers
on
it.
if
this
were
released,
even
after
advice
of
counsel,
there
would
be
a
serious
question
in
my
mind
as
a
defense
lawyer
whether
it
wasn't
voluntarily
released.
i
mean,
yes,
if
you
actually
hit
a
guy
on
the
head
and
take
something
away
from
him,
there's
no
problem.
but,
if
it
is
your
decision
not
to
contest
a
court
judgment
and
simply
accept
it
and
bring
these
materials
into
court,
there
is
a
serious
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
that
is
not
a
voluntary
surrender
and,
therefore,
your
right
to
suppress
may
indeed
be
restricted.
i
simply
invite
the
court's
attention
to
that.
i
have
used
most
of
my
time.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
thank
the
court
for
its
attention
and
for
the
privilege
of
being
here.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice
burger.
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
a
$500
fine
from
a
texas
district
court
and,
in
that
context,
it
is
obviously
not
an
important
case
and
that
is
obviously
not
why
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
importance
of
this
case
is
that
it
involves
the
very
independence
of
the
american
bar
to
give
free
untrammeled
legal
advice
to
a
client
who
has
the
right,
should
he
choose
to
do
so,
to
follow
it
or
disregard
it.
now,
i
think
perhaps
i
should
make
it
clear.
i
think
it's
been
made
clear
in
the
briefs
and
i
know
the
court
has
seen
them.
there
is
no
allegation
or
suggestion
or
suspicion
that
mr.
maness,
who
is
a
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
and
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and,
of
course,
the
texas
supreme
court
and
so
on,
was
in
any
way
contumacious
in
any
personal
sense
to
the
trial
court.
actually,
there
were
three
lawyers
involved
in
this
case,
a
mr.
friedman
who
is
unfortunately
now
deceased
and
a
mr.
maley
who
may
presently
be
in
the
courtroom.
i
don't
know
whether
he
is,
but
three
lawyers
gave
sincere
legal
advice
that
this
particular
client
did
not
have
to
produce
certain
documents
which,
the
state
contended,
were
incriminatory.
and,
it
is
simply
a
case
of
a
lawyer
being
punished
for
giving
advice
on
a
federal
constitutional
right,
and
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about.
now,
we
have
had
a
tradition
in
this
country,
since
certainly
adams
represented
the
british
soldiers
in
the
boston
massacre,
of
lawyers
at
least
being
allowed
to
represent
and
advice
their
clients
and
that
tradition
is
about
to
be
destroyed
if
this
contempt
citation
stands
up,
and
that
is
the
importance
of
the
case.
fortunately,
it
has--
had
already
been
decided
once.
i
think
perhaps
the
value
of
my
presentation
to
you
is
perhaps
in
discussing
the
facts
rather
than
the
law
because
the
law
has
been
completely
discussed
in
our
briefs.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
case
has
already
been
decided
by
the
united
states
district
court.
if
you
will
examine
appendix
c
in
our
brief
on
the
merits,
beginning
at
page
74,
you
will
find
the
opinion
of
judge
roberts
in
austin
dealing
with
mr.
maley
who
was
co-counsel
in
the
case
and
it's
a
white
horse
situation.
there's
no
difference
between
the
cases.
it
simply
was
a
choice
of
remedies.
mr.
maley
chose
to
go
the
habeas
corpus
route
through
the--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
no,
mr.
maness
chose
to
come
to
the
supreme
court
because
he
felt
that
it
was
important
enough
that
this
court
decide
it.
it
so
happens,
your
honor,
that
both
remedies
are
available.
you
could
go
the
habeas
corpus
route
or
the
certiorari
route.
and,
it
was
mr.
maness'
feeling,
very
strongly,
that
the
case
is
important
enough
to
be
decided
by
this
court
and
i
might--could
he
go
to
judge
roberts
now?
mr.
william
f.
walsh
sir?
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
i
don't
know
that
he
could,
having
come
here,
but
judge
roberts
has
decided
mr.
maley's
case
and
decided
it
in
what
i
think
is
a
simple
lucid
short
opinion
that
is
obvious
that
a
lawyer
has
a
right
to
tell
someone
that,
in
his
opinion,
you
have
a
right
to
exercise
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
your
honor.
it's
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
and
the
fifth
circuit
is
holding
it
in
the
bench
pending
this
court's
decision
of
mr.
maness'
case.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
you
understand
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution
pending.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
separately
from
this.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
but
had
the
evidence
been
made
available
in
the
civil
proceeding,
it
obviously
would've
been
available
in
the
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
your
honor,
he
had
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
yes,
i
would
contend
that.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
a
citizen
in
any
case
has
a
constitutional
right,
if
he's
employed
counsel,
to
have
a
lawyer
working
for
him.
but,
you
must
remember
that
there
was
pending
a
criminal
case
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
and
that
the
lawyer's
focus
was
as
much
concerned
with
that
pending
criminal
case
as
it
was
with
the
civil
case
which
became
the
genesis
of
this
action.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
this
was
a
civil
proceeding
alleging
the
commission
of
a
criminal
offense
and,
i
might
add
this,
at
this
particular
day,
according
to
my
latest
information
from
granted
certiorari
law
week
and
so
on.
this
court
has
before
it,
either
having
granted
certiorari
or
applications
for
certiorari,
some-26
cases
involving
pornography
and
obscenity,
and
i
think
for
a
lawyer
in
the
middle
of
a
trial
when
this
court
itself
has
had
considerable
difficulties
through
the
years
in
determining
the
limits
and
bound
of
what
is
right
and
what
is
proper,
with
this
court
having
some-26
cases
before
it
right
now,
for
a
lawyer
working
in
a
texas
town
to
do
anything
except
suggest
to
a
client
that
he
ought
to
exercise
his
rights
against
self-incrimination
i
think
would
probably
be
negligence.
now,
i--
we
have
briefed
it
in
some
detail
the
merits
of
the
actual
defense
of
mckelva--
i
mean,
the
merits
of
his
refusal
to
produce
the
information
called
for
by
the
subpoenee
and
by
the
court
order.
and,
the
only
reason
we've
done
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
my
client
who
is
a
citizen-member
of
this
bar,
we've
had
some
disagreements
about
the
matter
but
the
only
reason
we've
done
it
is
simply
to
assure
this
court
that
the
advice
is
given
in
good
faith
that
it
wasn't
just
an
effort
to
avoid
legal
process
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
the
simple
remedy
for
that
and
the
remedy
that
was
presented
by
this
case
and
really
becomes
the
funny
feature
of
this
case
is
that,
of
course,
the
state
district
judge
has
the
right.
mr.
mckelva
having
received
his
advice
from
his
three
lawyers,
mr.
mckelva
had
the
right
to
disregard
the
court's
order
and,
thereby,
be
put
in
jail
for
contempt.
and
then,
it
could've
been
tested
by
habeas
corpus.
in
this
case,
it
was
tested
by
habeas
corpus.
judge
roberts
issued
a
writ
for
mr.
mckelva
and,
the
minute
the
state
judge
learned
that
the
federal
court
had
entertained
and
granted
the
writ
to
bring
him
into
the
federal
court,
the
state
judge
called
mr.
mckelva
over
from
the
county
jail
and
said
“i'm
going
to
let
you
go.
your
behavior
has
been
very
good
and
you
may
be
released.”
and,
of
course,
mooted
the
only
traditional
way
of
handling
this
case.
i
don't
think
this
court
can
find
a
case.
we've,
i
think,
done
a
decent
job
of
research
and
i
don't
think
this
court
can
find
a
case
where
a
lawyer's
been
put
in
jail
for
giving
non-contumacious
advice
just
because
a
judge
happens
to
think
that
it's
contrary
to
what
he
wants
done.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
you
want
to
know
if
it
was
going
to
be
the
same.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
erroneous,
yes.
good
faith
is
the
question.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
i'm
entitled
to
make
mistakes
in
my
practice
of
law
without
going
to
jail.
now,
if
i'm
arguing
a
proposition
to
you
which
is
not
in
good
faith,
if
i'm
trying
to
kid
the
court,
this
court
or
the
court
in
tyler,
that's
another
kettle
of
fish
and,
quite
frankly,
i
might
take
a
somewhat
different
position
in
that
event.
but,
so
long
as
the
legal
advice
is
in
fact
given
in
good
faith
and,
as
i
say,
in
this
case
we
have
tried
to
demonstrate
to
you
that
there
are
good
faith
grounds
for
believing
that
the
advice
was
correct.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
you
have--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that's
exactly
what
the--
put
the
man
in
jail
for
contempt
of
court
and
then,
in
texas,
we
would
have
a
right
to
litigate
the
legality
of
the
confinement
and
the--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
sir,
my
light
is
on
but
let
me
say
this.
the
record--
the
appendix
clearly
shows
and
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
lawyers
did
not
advice
him
to
ignore
any
court
order.
they
simply
advised
him
what
they
thought
his
legal
rights
were.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
if
i
may,
your
honor--[luncheon
break]
mr.
william
f.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
asked
the
martial
to
divide
my
time
in
half
so
that
i
may
have
some
time
for
rebuttal,
and
i
just
have
a
few
more
remarks
i
wish
to
make
to
the
court
at
this
time.
first,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
if
michael
maness
is
guilty
of
contempt
of
court
for
advising
a
client
about
his
fifth
amendment
rights,
this
court
ought
to
summon
mr.
sinclair
back
for
advising
president
nixon
not
to
surrender
those
tapes
and
hold
him
in
contempt
of
court.
this
is
a
perfect
situation
of
a
lawyer
giving
pro--
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
no,
i
didn't
suggest
that
the
client
was
not.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
this
court
has
decided
that
very
question
in
ryan
versus
united
states
in
the
fall
of
the
second--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
no,
i
think
the
lawyer
has
the
right
to
give
free
and
untrammeled
advice
under
any
circumstances
as
long
as
it's
an
honest
professional--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
i
would
be
making
a
quite
different
argument
if
that
were
the
case
but,
under
the
texas
law
as
it
applies
to
this
particular
case,
there
was
no
way
to
do
that.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that
is
correct,
sir,
but--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
your
honor,
the
lawyers
attempted
to
obtain
habeas
corpus
relief
from
both
the
supreme
court
of
texas
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
both
of
which
denied
relief.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
they
then
went
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
texas
which
granted
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and,
the
minute
the
federal
court
granted
the
writ,
the
state
judge
released
the
prisoner,
thereby,
mooting
the
whole
case.
well,
is
there
any--
sir?
mr.
william
f.
walsh
he
just
washed
it
off.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
mr.
zwiener
and
mr.
dibrell
can
answer
that,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
such
dispute.
am
i
correct?
if
you
would,
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
way
to
do
it.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
that's
all,
your
honor.
i
just
do
want
to
suggest
that
this--
before
i
turn
this
over
to
my
friends
at
the
attorney
general's
office,
i
do
want
to
suggest
that
we
are
toying
here
with
the
right
of
a
free
american
lawyer
to
give
free
and
untrammeled
legal
advice
to
a
person
who's
in
trouble.
and,
that
is
what
is
really
involved
in
this
case
and
i
hope
the
court
will
recognize
it
in
deciding
it.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
can
hold
the
witness
in
contempt
and
let
the
witness
exercise
his
right
to
habeas
corpus
and
the
other
relief
which
is
available,
which
is
precisely
what
this
court
decided
in
ryan.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
sir?
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
frankly,
i
am
not
briefed
to
discuss
that
but
my
answer
would
be,
just
having
briefed
the
rest
of
this
case,
my
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
hold
the
witness
in
contempt.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
am
willing
to
concede,
your
honor,
that
there
are
peculiar
circumstances
that
i
can
conceive
of
where
the
lawyer's
advice
would
be
so
frivolous
that
perhaps
the
court
could
take
disciplinary
action,
but
i
don't
think
by
way
of
contempt.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
the
way
would
be
through
the
grievance
procedure
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
that
happens
to
be
my
opinion.
i--
as
i
say,
that
we're
not
involved
in
that
here.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
this
man
was
under
a
criminal
accusation
at
the
time
and
it
happened
to
arise
in
the
context
of
a
civil
action,
but
he
was
under
a
pending
existing
criminal
action
at
the
time.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
sir,
and
was
contraband.
the
state
has
cited
dibella
in
its
briefing.
now,
the
material
in
dibella's
case
was
not
contraband.
in
this
case,
if
the
state
was
correct
in
its
contention
that
it
was
contraband,
it,
seems
to
me,
raise
some
slow
couture
that
the
man
has
the
right
to
refuse
to
produce
it.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
yes.
i
would
say
it's
different
because
of
the
pendency
of
the
criminal
proceedings
against
this
man,
but
i
would
go
a
little
further.
first,
if
the
client
wishes
to
follow
his
lawyer's
advice,
if
the
lawyer
says
“don't
answer
that
question,
i
don't
care
what
the
judge
says,”
if
he
chooses
to
follow,
he
goes
to
jail
and
that
may
be
tested
in
the
proper
appellate
remedy,
as
is
suggested
in
ryan.
now,
just
a
moment,
your
honor,
the
next
thing
is
that
it
is
totally
frivolous
information
that
the
lawyer
has
given
the
client
if
it
is
stupid
advice.
we
do
have
laws
involving
malpractice.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
and
the
client
has
remedy
against
the
lawyer.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that's
all
that's
involved
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
am
drawing
a
sharp
enough
distinction
so
that
i
am
willing
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
because
it
isn't
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
so.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
not
in--
completely
free
from
the
subject
on
which
he
is
advising.
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
so
at
all.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
do.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
the
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
it
is
the
constitutional
right,
for
instance,
to
a
jury
trial
and
anything
above
it
more
than
$20.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
that
involves
the
constitutional
right
to
have
counsel
represent
you.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
i
would
be
prepared
to
contend
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
encompasses
the
right
to
trial
back
to
the
right
to
assistance
of
counsel
in
civil
courts.
if
you
happen
to
have
counsel
and
he's
there
and,
as
these
lawyers
were,
whether
you
have
the
right
to
appointed
counsel,
as
we
do
in
criminal
cases,
is
another
kettle
of
fish
but,
certainly,
if
you
have
a
lawyer
there
and
he
gives
you
the
advice
and
you
follow
it,
i
think
that's
your
risk
and
your
remedy
is
against
the
lawyer.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
he
can
put
the
client
in
jail.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
i
have
seen
one
case
in
my
own
home
federal
district
where
the
lawyer's
asserted
a
claim
of
privileges
to
a
communication
that
was
made
to
them
by
the
clients
and
judge
connelly
took
the
position
“fine,
i
can
hold
you
in
contempt
of
court
if
you
don't
answer
the
question,”
and
he
said
“if
you're
right,
you
can
revert,”
but
you
understand
this
is
the
lawyer
directly
claiming
a
privilege
of
his
own.
this
is
not
advising
a
client
as
we
have
in
this
case,
and
judge
connelly's
position
was
“well,
i'm
going
to
hold
you
in
contempt
and
if
you
win
in
the
supreme
court
or
the
fifth
circuit
or
anywhere
else,
that's
fine
but
i'm
not
going
to
reduce
the
sentence
at
the
end
of
120
days,
but
that's
a
different
situation.
no,
i
think
the
lawyer
has
a
certain
degree
of
immunity
and
i
think
it's
up
to
this
court
to
protect
it.
the--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
your
honor,
i
would
hope
that
i
would
advise
him
to
appeal
the
injunction.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
it--
your
honor,
if
there
was
judicial
relief
available,
it
would
be
a
different
kettle
of
fish.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
but,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
judicial
relief
available.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
i
think
it's
an
important
point.
whether
it
is
critical
or
not,
i
don't
know,
but
it
certainly
is
an
important
issue
and
i
agree
with
you
that
the
court
needs
to
consider
it.
but,
the
fact
remains
that,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
relief
available
other
than
the
relief
that
was
actually
granted
by
the
united
states
district
judge
and
was,
thereafter,
mooted
by
the
state
judge
when
he
realized
that
it
was
going
to
get
into
federal
court,
and
that
is
the
peculiar
reason
for
this
whole
case.
i
would
like
very
much
to
keep
some
of
my
time
and,
unless
the
court
has
other
questions,
and
turn
it
over
to
my
friends
in
the
attorney
general's
office.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
very
little,
your
honor.
i'll
just
say
this.
every
time
i
have
to
be
down
at
the
police
station
at
midnight
and
tell
a
client
“by
george!
you
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
talk
to
the
police,”
i
guess
i
am
obstructing
justice
if
that
is
within
the
meaning
of
what
our
friends
from
the
state
say,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
advice
given
in
this
case
was
obviously
sound.
it
was
obviously
founded
on
careful
pleadings.
it,
i
think,
is
totally
sustained
by
our
briefs
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
key
issue
in
this
case.
i
think
the
key
issue
is
the
right
of
the
lawyer
to
give
advice,
and
this
court
in
ryan
has
made
it
very
clear
that
there's
a
conventional,
easy,
simple
way
to
pursue
this
matter
and
handle
it.
and,
in
answer
to
the
question
that
was
asked
from
the
bench,
first,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
at
page,
i
believe
it's
41,
yes
of
the--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
of
the
appendix,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
texas
simply
denied
the
motion
for
relief
to
file
the
application
for
habeas
corpus
as
to
mckelva.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
did
the
same,
and
both
of
those
notations
are
at
page
41
of
the
appendix.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
they
moved
fast,
your
honor,
and
did
everything
they
could
for
their
client.
but,
they
then
received
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
from
judge
roberts,
and
it
was
on
that
day,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
while
they
were
hand-carrying
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
from
judge
roberts
to
the
state
district
court,
he
apparently
learned
of
it
through
some
informal
way
which
we
honestly
do
not
know
and
he
had
the
man
brought
over
from
the
county
jail
and
dismissed
the
charge
against
him.
and,
of
course,
that
mooted
the
federal
habeas
corpus
for
the--
as
to
the
client.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
he
was
in
contempt
of
court,
your
honor.
i'm
unsure
how--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
and
that
was
what
was
given
the
lawyers
too.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
the
reviewing
judge--
as
mr.
dibrell
has
said,
the
reviewing
judge
changed
the
jail
sentences
to
the
lawyer
as
to
both
mr.
maley
and
mr.
maness
to
a
$500-fine
but,
of
course,
on
non-payment
of
the
fine
they're
subject
to
going
to
jail.
and,
there
is
a--
what
i
think
is
a
perfectly
sound
opinion
from
judge
roberts.
it
is
exhibit
c
on
the
brief
on
the
merits.
judge
roberts
is
from
texas.
he
knows
what
goes
on
and
how
it
goes
on
and,
quite
frankly,
i
don't
think
this
court
could
do
any
better
than
to
simply
adopt
judge
roberts'
opinion
as
to
both
parties.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
no,
judge
roberts,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
it's,
i
believe,
exhibit
c.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
yes,
at
page
74
of
our--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
brief
on
the
merits.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
and--
mr.
william
f.
walsh
your
honor,
we
have
several
independent
statutes
on
immunity
in
various
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
william
f.
walsh
well,
yes
and,
furthermore,
i
might
point
out
that
the
idea
that
mr.
dibrell
suggested
to
the
court
i
have
crow
with
it.
i
think
chief
justice
burger
had
his
fingers
on
it.
if
this
were
released,
even
after
advice
of
counsel,
there
would
be
a
serious
question
in
my
mind
as
a
defense
lawyer
whether
it
wasn't
voluntarily
released.
i
mean,
yes,
if
you
actually
hit
a
guy
on
the
head
and
take
something
away
from
him,
there's
no
problem.
but,
if
it
is
your
decision
not
to
contest
a
court
judgment
and
simply
accept
it
and
bring
these
materials
into
court,
there
is
a
serious
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
that
is
not
a
voluntary
surrender
and,
therefore,
your
right
to
suppress
may
indeed
be
restricted.
i
simply
invite
the
court's
attention
to
that.
i
have
used
most
of
my
time.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
thank
the
court
for
its
attention
and
for
the
privilege
of
being
here.
