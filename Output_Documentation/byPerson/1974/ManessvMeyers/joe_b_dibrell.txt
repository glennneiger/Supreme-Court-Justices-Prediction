mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
starting
into--
on
point,
i
would
like
to,
i
think,
clear
the
record
with
reference
to
the
matter
of
the
way
this
case
came
here.
i
think
that
there
is
no
evidence
for
insufficiency
that
evidence
question
concerning
the
fact
that
the
attorney
did
in
fact
advice
mckelva,
the
witness,
not
to
produce
the
magazines
that
were
subpoenaed.
no
question
that
he'd
advice
him
further,
the
second
time,
to
produce
them
and
actually
if
this
advice
was
what
was
followed
and
what
judge
roberts
held
to
be
contemptible
on
the
part
of
the
witness
as
well
as
the
attorneys.
i
think
it's
pointed
out
on
page
14
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
they
want
to
make
sure
that
there's
no
question
about
the
jurisdiction
or
about
the
fact
that
the
actual
advice
had
been
given
to
disobey
the
trial
judge's
order
to
produce
the
material.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
the--
mckelva
served
seven
days
in
jail,
your
honor.
they
were
not
dropped.
he
actually
served.
it
was
a
10-day
contempt--
criminal
contempt
sentence
and
he
served
7
of
those
days,
and
the
judge
released
him
3
days
early
and,
at
the
time--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
the
course
of
the
relief
of
the
lawyer
under
article
1911
(a)
of
the
texas
statutes,
your
honor,
justice
marshall,
the--
before
the
attorney
could
actually
be
held
in
contempt,
actually
have
to
pay
a
fine
or
serve
time
in
jail
when
the
contempt
has
been
asserted
by
the
judge.
another
judge
must
come
in
and
preside
over
the
matter
and
to
hear
the
matter
as
somewhat
as
a
review
to--
and
make
an
independent
judgment
as
to
whether
to
uphold
the
contempt
of
the
attorney.
this
was
done
in
this
case
by
judge
meyers.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
what,
sir?
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that
was
the--
that
was
before
the
writs
were
denied,
from
my
understanding
that
that
developed
before
the
writs
were
denied
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
or
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
with
reference
to
the,
not
to
mckelva
but,
with
reference
to
the
dis--
the
contempt,
actually
the
lawyer
is,
as
far
as
making
a
file,
a
determination
occurred
long
after
the
mootness
of
the
mckelva
content.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
attorney,
you
see,
not
had
there,
review
by
judge
meyers
under
the
texas
procedure
where
the
attorneys--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
under
1911
(a),
once
he'd
made
the
decision,
your
honor,
he
no
longer
had
the
decision--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
to
do
it.
i
think
it's
now
to
judge
meyers
to
another
judge
who
was
assigned,
judge
clauson,
no
longer
actually
had
control
of
the
contempt
of
the
lawyers
at
that
point.
i
think
once
he
had
made
the
adjudication
then
to
whether
or
not
he
was
going
to
be
upheld
or
whether
he
will
be
in
contempt
or
not
would
be
determined
by
the
judge
who
was
assigned
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
they
have
on
occasions,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it's
uniform.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
they
have
on
occasion.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
had
to
make
an
application
to
the
state
before.
i
think
we
could
have
had
jurisdiction
for
judge
roberts.
i
think
he
had
actually
made
an
application
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
to
the
supreme
court
as
well,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it,
perhaps
if
there
was
jurisdiction,
by
judge
roberts
to
initially
grant
the
writ
as
far
as
not
having
exhausted
a
state
remedy.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
there
was
a
motion
to
quash,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
the
argument--
the
motion
contained
one
thing.
that
the
magazines
were
not
owned
by
the
witness--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
with
no
property
interest.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
and,
it
also
asserted
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
overruled,
yes.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
not
at
that
point.
it
would
not--
i
think
judge--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
that
the
remedy
course,
had
we
want
to
get
it,
and
my
principal
argument
to
mr.--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
what,
sir?
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
perhaps
there
might--
i'm
not
sure.
we'd--
i
don't
think
it's
developed
in
the
state
procedure.
i
don't
know
that
they're
actually
prohibited
of
trying
to
obtain
an
appellate
judge's
mandamus
if
a
judge
is
made
completely
erroneous.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
not
at
that
point.
they're
actually
the--
just
the
denial
of
the
subpoena--
i
mean,
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena
at
that
point.
that's
right.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
and
he
had
not
yet
held
them
in
contempt
yet
either--
at
that
point
either.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
i
would
like
to
point
out
very--
at
this--
right
at
the
beginning
here
that
the
respondent
is
not
in
the
position
here
to
urge
a
decision
anyway
that
it
would
actually
destroy
or
diminish
or
dilute
witness'
right
to
cert
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
or
even
a
right
of
a
counsel
to
give
legal
advices
to
its
effects.
really,
what
the
respondent
is
here
and
what
we
are
seeking
and
urging
upon
this
court
is
some
validation
of
the
tools
to
the
trial
judges
to
compel
the
art
of
proceedings
of
the
maters
before
them.
i
think
it's
respondent's
really
petition--
contention
here
that
it
is
the
judge
and
not
the
lawyer
who
must
be
the
final
arbiter
of
such
matters
and,
as
to
the
suppression
of
evidence
or
claim
of
privilege
subject
for
review,
as
the
trial
proceeding
can
go
on
in
due
course.
and,
i
readily
admit
that
the
conduct
of
counsel
here
was
not
contumacious,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
it
was
contemptuous
in
the
sense
that
it
did
actually
counsel
a
disobedience
of
a
trial
judge's
order
for
production
of
these
matters.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
not
until
such
time
as
the
judge
specifically
says
“you
go
ahead
and
answer
the
question
and
then,
if
the
lawyer
persists
in
telling
it,
i
think
at
that
point
it's
the
witness'
determination
to
make
that
determination
whether
he
wants
to
be
held
in
contempt,
go
ahead
and
suffer
the
consequences
for
being
held
in
contempt
or--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
now,
it
just
might
not
be
a
normal
means
but
then,
about
the
same
token,
if
we
give
this
absolute
right,
and
i
think
that
the--
if
the
court
is
going
to
sanction
action
upon
the
counsel
or
just
to
actually
disobey
the
court's
order
in
that
point
and
not
be
held
in
some
obedience
to
following
the
court's
order,
i
think
is
already
been
pointed
out
in
other
areas
of
disobeying
a
order
of
the
court,
the
courts
are
turned
into
boards
of
arbitration.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
he
would,
yes,
your
honor,
i
think,
if
i
understand
your
question
right.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
at
that
point,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
because
if
he--
the
feeling
of
the
frustration
upon
the
part
of
trial
judge
in
this
proceeding
where,
first
of
all,
he
denied
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena
then
he
asked
counsel
if
he
want.
he
did
not
want
to
hold
mckelva
in
contempt
at
this
point.
he
said
“i
want
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
produce
these
magazines
that
had
been
subpoenaed.
how
much
time
would
you
like?”
counsel
replied
“well,
you'll
have
to
make
that
determination.
we
cannot
suggest.
it
could
even
be
10
days
we'd
still
not
produce
it.”
nevertheless,
the
court
recessed
until
1:00
and
to
permit
the
production
of
the
magazines
in
convenience
to
his
order.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that's
right,
persisted
in
it.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
it's
his
second
persistence
in
it
that
we--
that
the
respondent
feels
was
contemptible
on
the
part
of
counsel.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
fifth
amendment
was
frustrating
the
course
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
think
that
the
brief
that
we
filed
and
the
fact
that
i
think
your
position
in
dibella
and
actually
in
the
analysis
of
boyd
and
i
think
that
clearly,
as
far
as
the
actual
facts
of
this
case,
mckelva
did
not
have
a
right
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment.
i
mean,
he
couldn't
properly
assert
it
was
powerful.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
this
is
still
a
civil
proceeding,
justice
douglas,
in
the
sense
that
we're
trying
just
to
see
whether
it's
about
the
injunction
is,
not
one
with
any
further
problems.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
that,
as
justice
black
has
indicated
in
adams
versus
maryland,
the
fact
that
he
will
still
be
able
to
be
very
asserting
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
would
give
immunity
to
what,
actually
at
that
point,
flow
from
it.
if
he
had
to
actually
had
to
produce
it
in
these
books
at
this
point,
i
don't
think
he
could
use
that
as
the
factor
showing
that
he
had
possession
of
it
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
could
still
have
his
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
later
on.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
that
what
this
court
really
needs
to
help
to
decide
this
is
to
keep
the
balance
of
what
the
right
of
the
people
and
a
right
of
the
court
to
ultimately
have
all
of
the
facts
brought
forth
any
proceeding,
civil
proceeding
and
criminal
proceeding,
obviously
fifth
amendment
privileges,
other
constitutional
rights.
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
court
to
protect
these
witnesses
and
parties
as
well,
but
that--
i
think
that
what
is
necessary
and
what
would
be
helpful
and
necessary
is
that
we
could
go
ahead
and
actually
have
the
prophylactic
rule
about
it,
as
suggested
by
the
modern
rule
of
evidence,
the
fact
that
this
would
be--
you
actually
would
have
this
immunity.
you
go
ahead
and
produce
it
and
you
would
have
this
immunity
from
actual
to
criminal
prosecution.
you
use
in
criminal
prosecution
that
part
of
it.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
so.
once
the
court
has
had
to
make
some
determination,
once
he
has
had
to
be
the
arbiter
of
this
particular
matter
of
the
proper
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
not,
what--
i
think
what
the
trial
court,
all
trial
courts,
need
at
least
have
the--
as
far
as
possible
to
make
and
a
erroneously
a
free
judgment
call
as
possible
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
witness
who's
claiming
a
privilege,
as
well
as
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
parties
who
are
entitled
to
have
the
information
come
into
the
trial.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that's
right,
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
what
we
need
is
to
cut
down
as
much
as
possible
there
up
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
it's
a
suggestion
that
i
would
make
the--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
wouldn't
argue--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
if
i
can
get--
i
think
that
your
question
is
the
one
point,
i
hope,
justice
white,
in
that
what
is
needed
i
think,
as
far
as
the
trial
judge
is
concerned,
recognizing
that,
there,
the
protectors
of
the
rights
of
the
witnesses
and
all
authorities,
at
least
to
have
it
in
camera
examination
of
documents
which
have
been
subpoenaed
to
make
a
better
det--
more
determination
and,
perhaps,
would
even
urge
that
some
in-chamber
inquiry
up
to
the
point
is
to
what
the
testimony--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
you're
talking
about
an
involuntary
surrender.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
i
think--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
you
can,
at
that
time,
move
to
suppress
it.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
i
think
texas
is
under
the
same
ruling
as
this
court
as
any
other
state
courts.
in
this
instance,
i
think
that
this
court
has
ruled
that
you
can
still--
have
found
that
you
can
still
move
to
suppress
evidence.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
can't
cite
a
case,
your
honor,
but
i
would--
my--
probably,
yes,
it
would
be--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
even--
frankly,
i
don't
think
that
the
state
courts
have
had
the
point
to
where
he
would--
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
saying
which
say
that
he
would
have
this
risk
anymore
than
with
the
federal
system.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
that,
frankly,
that
the
state
court
would
sustain
a
motion
to
suppress,
but
i
cannot
cite
you
to
a
case.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
ought
to
hold
that.
there,
again,
i
think
the
contempt
that
we're
here
is
the
actual
disobeying--
the
actual
very--
to
go
ahead
and
actually
disobey
and
not
just
giving
advice
as
to
what
might
be
the
consequences.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
this
is
what
mr.
walsh
indicated,
let
the--
let
his
client
go
to
jail.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
of
course,
in
this
case,
the
judge
didn't
put
them
both
in
jail
until
he--
you
don't
get
the
trial.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
what,
sir?
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
gave
them
10
days,
but
he
could
not
then
put
the
lawyer
in
jail.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
because
another
judge
has
to
come
in
and
hear
the
matter.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
because
article
1911
(a)
of
the
texas
statute
provides
that
an
officer
of
the
court
or
the
attorney
who
is
held
in
contempt
by
a
judge,
that
judge
must
let
another
judge
come
in
and
preside
over
the
matter.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
he
doesn't
litigate
it
by
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
he
would
be
broth
forth
to
be
litigated
in
court.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
anymore
unfettered
discretion
than
any
judge
in
the
trial
of
any
proceedings
that
he's
got
to
consciously
follow
the--
what
he
understand
what
action
of
the
law
is.
he's
under
the
same
commands
of
all
of
the
federal
judges
as
anyone
else
in
the
matter
of
constitutional
all-preserving,
protecting
the
rights
of
witnesses
or
parties.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
and
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
that
he
has
either
gone
to
sus--
when
the
privilege
is
raised,
he's
either
got
the
option
of
either--
obviously,
he's
got
the
option
of
either
sustaining
the
assertion
of
the--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
judge
can
also
be
wrong.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
returns
the--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
he
still
has
available
to
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
even
in
this
proceeding,
this
current
proceeding--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
and
also
to
object
to
it.
the
judge
has
not
even
had
an
in-camera
inspection
of
the
materials,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
a
case
to
suppress
evidence?
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
in
these
circumstances.
no,
i
cannot
give
you.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
at
least
judge
clauson
was
taking
this
attitude.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
i
think.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
of
it
as
an
assurance
by
this
court
and
this
proceeding
that
it
could
be
reached
by
that
being
considered.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
now,
that's
the
trial
judge.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
it's
judge
clauson.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
by
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
state
court,
state
appellate
court.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
was
sentenced
for
criminal
contempt
of
10
days
and--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
by
judge
clauson,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
state
habeas
corpus.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
all
the
way
up.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
they
could've
granted.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
had
already
made
this.
he
was
leaving
before
he
had
a
review
by
the
federal
district
judge.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
mckelva.
no,
he'd
already
made
his--
he'd
already
been
reviewed
by
the
state
court.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
would
n--
that's
right,
he
would
not
been
held
in
contempt.
he'd
been
obeying
the
judge's
orders.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
your
honor?
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
more,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
pointing
out
here
that,
actually,
at
this
point
of
the
subpoena,
there's
no
record,
there's
no
books
or
anything
else.
the
court
has
not
even
had
an
opportunity
to
make
an
in-camera
examination
to
rule
on
the
admissibility
of
them
by
having
them
to
see,
to
actually
make
a
judgment
call
in
that
sense
of
incrimination
or
anything
else.
all
he
has
is
the
motion
and
the
raising
of
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
by
counsel,
and
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
here
was
trying--
was
pointing
out
to
counsel
that
if
i
turn
these
over
to
the
city
attorney
who
has
asked
for
the
court
to
subpoena
these
magazines.
at
that
point,
you
can
object
to
their
being
introduced
by
the
city
attorney
raising
grounds
and
to
still
have
a
review
of
that
and
appeal
later
as
to
whether
or
not
“if
i
do
admit
him,
you
can
object
to
it,
you
can
have
a
review
by
the
appellate
court
to
determine
whether
i
laid
the
correct
judgment
or
not.
if
i--
in
my
view,
that
they
should
be
suppressed
or
your
objection
is
good,
they
do
not
come
into
this
trial.”
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
i
think
this
court
has
already
determines
that
it
is
very
personal.
it
has
to
be
very
personal
in
its
claim
and
it
must
be
asserted
for
as
i
think,
as
i
read
the
decision
and
as
i
understand
the
procedure,
going
to
the
actual
privacy
of
the
person's
either
in
the
facts,
his
papers,
and
of
course
also
his
testimony
which
might
be
obviously
personal
to
him
if
it
incriminates
him.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
show
that
you
are
bound
to
be
convicted.
no,
i
think
it
is
enough
that
you
might
be
prosecuted.
i
think
that
a--
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
in
the
fact
that
it
might
be--
you've
got
to
show
that
it's
obviously
some
incrimination,
otherwise
i
don't
think
that
there's
proper
assertion.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
don't
see
the
distinction
there,
but
what
are
the
possible
some
criminal
prosecution
pending
or
civil.
i
think
that,
still,
he's
got
a
duty
to
produce
these
particular
magazines
in
this
case.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
starting
into--
on
point,
i
would
like
to,
i
think,
clear
the
record
with
reference
to
the
matter
of
the
way
this
case
came
here.
i
think
that
there
is
no
evidence
for
insufficiency
that
evidence
question
concerning
the
fact
that
the
attorney
did
in
fact
advice
mckelva,
the
witness,
not
to
produce
the
magazines
that
were
subpoenaed.
no
question
that
he'd
advice
him
further,
the
second
time,
to
produce
them
and
actually
if
this
advice
was
what
was
followed
and
what
judge
roberts
held
to
be
contemptible
on
the
part
of
the
witness
as
well
as
the
attorneys.
i
think
it's
pointed
out
on
page
14
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
they
want
to
make
sure
that
there's
no
question
about
the
jurisdiction
or
about
the
fact
that
the
actual
advice
had
been
given
to
disobey
the
trial
judge's
order
to
produce
the
material.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
the--
mckelva
served
seven
days
in
jail,
your
honor.
they
were
not
dropped.
he
actually
served.
it
was
a
10-day
contempt--
criminal
contempt
sentence
and
he
served
7
of
those
days,
and
the
judge
released
him
3
days
early
and,
at
the
time--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
the
course
of
the
relief
of
the
lawyer
under
article
1911
(a)
of
the
texas
statutes,
your
honor,
justice
marshall,
the--
before
the
attorney
could
actually
be
held
in
contempt,
actually
have
to
pay
a
fine
or
serve
time
in
jail
when
the
contempt
has
been
asserted
by
the
judge.
another
judge
must
come
in
and
preside
over
the
matter
and
to
hear
the
matter
as
somewhat
as
a
review
to--
and
make
an
independent
judgment
as
to
whether
to
uphold
the
contempt
of
the
attorney.
this
was
done
in
this
case
by
judge
meyers.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
what,
sir?
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that
was
the--
that
was
before
the
writs
were
denied,
from
my
understanding
that
that
developed
before
the
writs
were
denied
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
or
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
with
reference
to
the,
not
to
mckelva
but,
with
reference
to
the
dis--
the
contempt,
actually
the
lawyer
is,
as
far
as
making
a
file,
a
determination
occurred
long
after
the
mootness
of
the
mckelva
content.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
attorney,
you
see,
not
had
there,
review
by
judge
meyers
under
the
texas
procedure
where
the
attorneys--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
under
1911
(a),
once
he'd
made
the
decision,
your
honor,
he
no
longer
had
the
decision--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
to
do
it.
i
think
it's
now
to
judge
meyers
to
another
judge
who
was
assigned,
judge
clauson,
no
longer
actually
had
control
of
the
contempt
of
the
lawyers
at
that
point.
i
think
once
he
had
made
the
adjudication
then
to
whether
or
not
he
was
going
to
be
upheld
or
whether
he
will
be
in
contempt
or
not
would
be
determined
by
the
judge
who
was
assigned
to
make
that
determination.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
they
have
on
occasions,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it's
uniform.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
they
have
on
occasion.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
had
to
make
an
application
to
the
state
before.
i
think
we
could
have
had
jurisdiction
for
judge
roberts.
i
think
he
had
actually
made
an
application
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
to
the
supreme
court
as
well,
but
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it,
perhaps
if
there
was
jurisdiction,
by
judge
roberts
to
initially
grant
the
writ
as
far
as
not
having
exhausted
a
state
remedy.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
there
was
a
motion
to
quash,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
the
argument--
the
motion
contained
one
thing.
that
the
magazines
were
not
owned
by
the
witness--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
with
no
property
interest.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
and,
it
also
asserted
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
overruled,
yes.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
not
at
that
point.
it
would
not--
i
think
judge--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
that
the
remedy
course,
had
we
want
to
get
it,
and
my
principal
argument
to
mr.--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
what,
sir?
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
perhaps
there
might--
i'm
not
sure.
we'd--
i
don't
think
it's
developed
in
the
state
procedure.
i
don't
know
that
they're
actually
prohibited
of
trying
to
obtain
an
appellate
judge's
mandamus
if
a
judge
is
made
completely
erroneous.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
not
at
that
point.
they're
actually
the--
just
the
denial
of
the
subpoena--
i
mean,
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena
at
that
point.
that's
right.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
and
he
had
not
yet
held
them
in
contempt
yet
either--
at
that
point
either.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
i
would
like
to
point
out
very--
at
this--
right
at
the
beginning
here
that
the
respondent
is
not
in
the
position
here
to
urge
a
decision
anyway
that
it
would
actually
destroy
or
diminish
or
dilute
witness'
right
to
cert
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
or
even
a
right
of
a
counsel
to
give
legal
advices
to
its
effects.
really,
what
the
respondent
is
here
and
what
we
are
seeking
and
urging
upon
this
court
is
some
validation
of
the
tools
to
the
trial
judges
to
compel
the
art
of
proceedings
of
the
maters
before
them.
i
think
it's
respondent's
really
petition--
contention
here
that
it
is
the
judge
and
not
the
lawyer
who
must
be
the
final
arbiter
of
such
matters
and,
as
to
the
suppression
of
evidence
or
claim
of
privilege
subject
for
review,
as
the
trial
proceeding
can
go
on
in
due
course.
and,
i
readily
admit
that
the
conduct
of
counsel
here
was
not
contumacious,
but
i
think
it
is
clear
that
it
was
contemptuous
in
the
sense
that
it
did
actually
counsel
a
disobedience
of
a
trial
judge's
order
for
production
of
these
matters.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
not
until
such
time
as
the
judge
specifically
says
“you
go
ahead
and
answer
the
question
and
then,
if
the
lawyer
persists
in
telling
it,
i
think
at
that
point
it's
the
witness'
determination
to
make
that
determination
whether
he
wants
to
be
held
in
contempt,
go
ahead
and
suffer
the
consequences
for
being
held
in
contempt
or--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
now,
it
just
might
not
be
a
normal
means
but
then,
about
the
same
token,
if
we
give
this
absolute
right,
and
i
think
that
the--
if
the
court
is
going
to
sanction
action
upon
the
counsel
or
just
to
actually
disobey
the
court's
order
in
that
point
and
not
be
held
in
some
obedience
to
following
the
court's
order,
i
think
is
already
been
pointed
out
in
other
areas
of
disobeying
a
order
of
the
court,
the
courts
are
turned
into
boards
of
arbitration.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
he
would,
yes,
your
honor,
i
think,
if
i
understand
your
question
right.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
at
that
point,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
because
if
he--
the
feeling
of
the
frustration
upon
the
part
of
trial
judge
in
this
proceeding
where,
first
of
all,
he
denied
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena
then
he
asked
counsel
if
he
want.
he
did
not
want
to
hold
mckelva
in
contempt
at
this
point.
he
said
“i
want
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
produce
these
magazines
that
had
been
subpoenaed.
how
much
time
would
you
like?”
counsel
replied
“well,
you'll
have
to
make
that
determination.
we
cannot
suggest.
it
could
even
be
10
days
we'd
still
not
produce
it.”
nevertheless,
the
court
recessed
until
1:00
and
to
permit
the
production
of
the
magazines
in
convenience
to
his
order.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that's
right,
persisted
in
it.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
it's
his
second
persistence
in
it
that
we--
that
the
respondent
feels
was
contemptible
on
the
part
of
counsel.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
fifth
amendment
was
frustrating
the
course
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
think
that
the
brief
that
we
filed
and
the
fact
that
i
think
your
position
in
dibella
and
actually
in
the
analysis
of
boyd
and
i
think
that
clearly,
as
far
as
the
actual
facts
of
this
case,
mckelva
did
not
have
a
right
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment.
i
mean,
he
couldn't
properly
assert
it
was
powerful.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
this
is
still
a
civil
proceeding,
justice
douglas,
in
the
sense
that
we're
trying
just
to
see
whether
it's
about
the
injunction
is,
not
one
with
any
further
problems.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
that,
as
justice
black
has
indicated
in
adams
versus
maryland,
the
fact
that
he
will
still
be
able
to
be
very
asserting
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
would
give
immunity
to
what,
actually
at
that
point,
flow
from
it.
if
he
had
to
actually
had
to
produce
it
in
these
books
at
this
point,
i
don't
think
he
could
use
that
as
the
factor
showing
that
he
had
possession
of
it
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
could
still
have
his
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
later
on.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
that
what
this
court
really
needs
to
help
to
decide
this
is
to
keep
the
balance
of
what
the
right
of
the
people
and
a
right
of
the
court
to
ultimately
have
all
of
the
facts
brought
forth
any
proceeding,
civil
proceeding
and
criminal
proceeding,
obviously
fifth
amendment
privileges,
other
constitutional
rights.
it's
the
responsibility
of
the
court
to
protect
these
witnesses
and
parties
as
well,
but
that--
i
think
that
what
is
necessary
and
what
would
be
helpful
and
necessary
is
that
we
could
go
ahead
and
actually
have
the
prophylactic
rule
about
it,
as
suggested
by
the
modern
rule
of
evidence,
the
fact
that
this
would
be--
you
actually
would
have
this
immunity.
you
go
ahead
and
produce
it
and
you
would
have
this
immunity
from
actual
to
criminal
prosecution.
you
use
in
criminal
prosecution
that
part
of
it.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
so.
once
the
court
has
had
to
make
some
determination,
once
he
has
had
to
be
the
arbiter
of
this
particular
matter
of
the
proper
assertion
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
not,
what--
i
think
what
the
trial
court,
all
trial
courts,
need
at
least
have
the--
as
far
as
possible
to
make
and
a
erroneously
a
free
judgment
call
as
possible
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
witness
who's
claiming
a
privilege,
as
well
as
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
parties
who
are
entitled
to
have
the
information
come
into
the
trial.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that's
right,
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
what
we
need
is
to
cut
down
as
much
as
possible
there
up
on
the
part
of
the
trial
judge.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
it's
a
suggestion
that
i
would
make
the--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
wouldn't
argue--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
if
i
can
get--
i
think
that
your
question
is
the
one
point,
i
hope,
justice
white,
in
that
what
is
needed
i
think,
as
far
as
the
trial
judge
is
concerned,
recognizing
that,
there,
the
protectors
of
the
rights
of
the
witnesses
and
all
authorities,
at
least
to
have
it
in
camera
examination
of
documents
which
have
been
subpoenaed
to
make
a
better
det--
more
determination
and,
perhaps,
would
even
urge
that
some
in-chamber
inquiry
up
to
the
point
is
to
what
the
testimony--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
you're
talking
about
an
involuntary
surrender.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
i
think--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
you
can,
at
that
time,
move
to
suppress
it.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
i
think
texas
is
under
the
same
ruling
as
this
court
as
any
other
state
courts.
in
this
instance,
i
think
that
this
court
has
ruled
that
you
can
still--
have
found
that
you
can
still
move
to
suppress
evidence.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
can't
cite
a
case,
your
honor,
but
i
would--
my--
probably,
yes,
it
would
be--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
even--
frankly,
i
don't
think
that
the
state
courts
have
had
the
point
to
where
he
would--
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
saying
which
say
that
he
would
have
this
risk
anymore
than
with
the
federal
system.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
that,
frankly,
that
the
state
court
would
sustain
a
motion
to
suppress,
but
i
cannot
cite
you
to
a
case.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
ought
to
hold
that.
there,
again,
i
think
the
contempt
that
we're
here
is
the
actual
disobeying--
the
actual
very--
to
go
ahead
and
actually
disobey
and
not
just
giving
advice
as
to
what
might
be
the
consequences.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
this
is
what
mr.
walsh
indicated,
let
the--
let
his
client
go
to
jail.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
of
course,
in
this
case,
the
judge
didn't
put
them
both
in
jail
until
he--
you
don't
get
the
trial.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
what,
sir?
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
gave
them
10
days,
but
he
could
not
then
put
the
lawyer
in
jail.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
because
another
judge
has
to
come
in
and
hear
the
matter.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
because
article
1911
(a)
of
the
texas
statute
provides
that
an
officer
of
the
court
or
the
attorney
who
is
held
in
contempt
by
a
judge,
that
judge
must
let
another
judge
come
in
and
preside
over
the
matter.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
he
doesn't
litigate
it
by
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
he
would
be
broth
forth
to
be
litigated
in
court.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
anymore
unfettered
discretion
than
any
judge
in
the
trial
of
any
proceedings
that
he's
got
to
consciously
follow
the--
what
he
understand
what
action
of
the
law
is.
he's
under
the
same
commands
of
all
of
the
federal
judges
as
anyone
else
in
the
matter
of
constitutional
all-preserving,
protecting
the
rights
of
witnesses
or
parties.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
and
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
that
he
has
either
gone
to
sus--
when
the
privilege
is
raised,
he's
either
got
the
option
of
either--
obviously,
he's
got
the
option
of
either
sustaining
the
assertion
of
the--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
judge
can
also
be
wrong.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
returns
the--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
he
still
has
available
to
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
even
in
this
proceeding,
this
current
proceeding--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
and
also
to
object
to
it.
the
judge
has
not
even
had
an
in-camera
inspection
of
the
materials,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
a
case
to
suppress
evidence?
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
in
these
circumstances.
no,
i
cannot
give
you.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
at
least
judge
clauson
was
taking
this
attitude.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
i
think.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
of
it
as
an
assurance
by
this
court
and
this
proceeding
that
it
could
be
reached
by
that
being
considered.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
now,
that's
the
trial
judge.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
it's
judge
clauson.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
by
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
state
court,
state
appellate
court.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
was
sentenced
for
criminal
contempt
of
10
days
and--
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
by
judge
clauson,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
state
habeas
corpus.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
all
the
way
up.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
they
could've
granted.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
had
already
made
this.
he
was
leaving
before
he
had
a
review
by
the
federal
district
judge.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
mckelva.
no,
he'd
already
made
his--
he'd
already
been
reviewed
by
the
state
court.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
he
would
n--
that's
right,
he
would
not
been
held
in
contempt.
he'd
been
obeying
the
judge's
orders.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
your
honor?
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
think
more,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
pointing
out
here
that,
actually,
at
this
point
of
the
subpoena,
there's
no
record,
there's
no
books
or
anything
else.
the
court
has
not
even
had
an
opportunity
to
make
an
in-camera
examination
to
rule
on
the
admissibility
of
them
by
having
them
to
see,
to
actually
make
a
judgment
call
in
that
sense
of
incrimination
or
anything
else.
all
he
has
is
the
motion
and
the
raising
of
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
by
counsel,
and
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
here
was
trying--
was
pointing
out
to
counsel
that
if
i
turn
these
over
to
the
city
attorney
who
has
asked
for
the
court
to
subpoena
these
magazines.
at
that
point,
you
can
object
to
their
being
introduced
by
the
city
attorney
raising
grounds
and
to
still
have
a
review
of
that
and
appeal
later
as
to
whether
or
not
“if
i
do
admit
him,
you
can
object
to
it,
you
can
have
a
review
by
the
appellate
court
to
determine
whether
i
laid
the
correct
judgment
or
not.
if
i--
in
my
view,
that
they
should
be
suppressed
or
your
objection
is
good,
they
do
not
come
into
this
trial.”
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
well,
i
think
this
court
has
already
determines
that
it
is
very
personal.
it
has
to
be
very
personal
in
its
claim
and
it
must
be
asserted
for
as
i
think,
as
i
read
the
decision
and
as
i
understand
the
procedure,
going
to
the
actual
privacy
of
the
person's
either
in
the
facts,
his
papers,
and
of
course
also
his
testimony
which
might
be
obviously
personal
to
him
if
it
incriminates
him.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
show
that
you
are
bound
to
be
convicted.
no,
i
think
it
is
enough
that
you
might
be
prosecuted.
i
think
that
a--
i
don't
think
there's
any
difference
in
the
fact
that
it
might
be--
you've
got
to
show
that
it's
obviously
some
incrimination,
otherwise
i
don't
think
that
there's
proper
assertion.
mr.
joe
b.
dibrell,
jr.
i
don't
see
the
distinction
there,
but
what
are
the
possible
some
criminal
prosecution
pending
or
civil.
i
think
that,
still,
he's
got
a
duty
to
produce
these
particular
magazines
in
this
case.
