was
there
any
dispute
between
you
and
your
opponents
as
to
whether
there
was
a
procedure
in
texas
to
challenge
this
ruling
other
than
back
in
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
there's
an
injunction
outstanding
against
the
party
and
the
lawyer
advised
him
not
to,
he
thought
the
injunction
was
invalid,
and
he
just
advised
him
to
disobey
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
if
you
didn't.
you
advised
him
to
disobey
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
the
critical
point.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
a
critical
point
in
your
entire
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
far
will
you
carry
that,
mr.
dibrell?
suppose,
getting
back
to
the
form
of
question
my
brother
marshall
asked,
the
response
was
“on
advice
of
counsel,
i
respectfully
refuse
on
grounds
of
self-incrimination,”
and
the
judge
says
“well,
i
don't
honor
that.
you
answer.”
and,
the
answer
was
“i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
on
advice
of
counsel,
i
respectfully
refuse
to
produce
it
on
grounds
of
self-incrimination.”
now,
in
that
circumstance,
would
the
lawyer
who
had
given
the
advice,
would
he
have
been
n
the
difficulty
that
this
lawyer
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
speaking
of
before
he
ever
takes
the
stand,
he
consults
an
attorney
and
the
attorney
tells
him
“no,
if
you're
asked
to
produce
it,
you
just
say
that
on
advice
of
counsel
you're
not
producing
it
but
pleading
privilege
against
self-incrimination.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
at
that
point,
alright.
now,
the
judge
says
“well,
i
don't
agree
with
you
and
i
order
you
to
produce
it,”
and
the
witness
says
“again,
i'm
sorry,
but
under
advice
of
counsel
i
refuse
to
produce
it.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it's
not,
but
i'm
asking,
would
the
lawyer
be
in
the
same
difficulty
that
mr.
maness
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
why
is
mr.
maness
in
the
difficulty
he's
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
lawyer
persisted
in
the
advice
he'd
initially
given.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
court
could
be
wrong.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
practicing
lawyers,
we've
all
known
instances
certainly
where
we
think
they're
wrong.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me
this,
mr.
dibrell.
suppose,
in
this
instance,
mr.
maness
had
said
“alright,
you
better
obey,”
and
so
he
surrendered
the
documents
he
had
possession
of.
and,
the
next
day,
there's
a
misdemeanor
charge
under
your
section
3
that
for
having
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
any
obscene
matter.
i
gather
that,
on
the
strength
of
what
he
surrendered,
even
though
his
lawyer
thought
he
didn't
have
to
surrender
but
just
to
obey
the
judge
he
surrendered
it,
i
guess
he'd
go
to
jail,
wouldn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
i'm
