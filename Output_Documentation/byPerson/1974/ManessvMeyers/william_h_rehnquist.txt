had
this
been
a
criminal
right
to
counsel
case,
i
suppose
the
right
of
the
lawyer
to
express
his
views
on
a
constitutional
right
could
be
based
on
the
provision
of
the
constitution
that
support
the
right
of
counsel
but,
in
a
civil
proceeding,
what
is
the
precise
basis
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
this
was--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
a
civil
proceeding,
was
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
contend
that
the
defendant
in
the
civil
proceeding
had
a
consti--
a
federal
constitutional
right
to
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
this
was
a
civil
proceeding,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
walsh,
supposing
that
instead
of
the
attorney's
objection
and
advice
being
based
on
fifth
amendment
grounds,
this
came
up
in
the
course
of
a
proceeding
where
his
client
was
on
the
stand,
the
client,
say,
was
a
defendant
in
a
civil
action
and
he's
being
crossed-examined.
the
other
lawyer
asked
him
a
question
and
his
lawyer
objects
on
the
ground
of
hearsay
and
the
trial
court
overrules
the
objection,
tells
the
client
who
was
on
the
witness
stand
“answer
the
question,”
and
then
the
lawyer
says,
very
politely,
“just
a
minute,
your
honor.
i'm
telling
my
client
not
to
answer
that
question.”
now,
there's
no
constitutional
issue
involved
there.
would
you
say
that
case
is
different
from
yours?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
that--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
your
argument
was
based
though
on
the
idea
that
this
was
advice
about
a
constitutional
claim.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
it's
simply--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
but
in
my
example,
it's
simply
a
question
of
whether
it's
hearsay
and
whether
he's
required
to
answer
in
the
normal
course
of
interrogation
of
a
witness.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
you
draw
a
rather
sharp
distinction
or
is
this
free
and--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
this--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
the
free
and
untrammeled
right
of
a
lawyer
to
give
legal
advice
something
that
exists
in
a--
quite
apart
from
the
subject
on
which
he's
advising?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
courtroom
he's--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
regardless
of
whether
the
subject
he's
advising
on
is
a
constitutional
right
or
not,
you
feel
that
in
a
courtroom
the
lawyer
has
a
right
to
give
free
and
untrammeled
legal
advice.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what's
the
source
in
the
constitution
for
that
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

you
don't
have
the
right
to--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--

that's
a
seventh
amendment
right

the
con--
it's
conferred
on
litigants
in
federal
courts.
you
were
