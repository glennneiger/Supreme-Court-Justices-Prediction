justice
potter
stewart
to
suppress
the
statements
made,
where
and
when
were
they
made,
or
are
you
going
to
get
to
that
i
guess?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
question?
justice
potter
stewart
he's
free
to
leave
alone
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
check
of
the
driver's
license
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
respondent
alone?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
you
speak
of
the
respondent's
arrest.
it's
your
position
the
respondent
was
not
arrested,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
the
step
two
so
far?
justice
potter
stewart
that
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
that's
what
you're
taking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
no
indication
that
if
the
occupants
in
this
car
or
any
car
had
given
their
identity
and
that
it
checked
out
that
they
would've
been
taken
to
any
station
now,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
there
was
any
testimony,
i
think
there
was
a
motion
to
suppress
and
it
was
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
tucker
against
michigan
involved
that
and
once
that
case,
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
would
be
the
decision
of
the
michigan
supreme
court
in
the
tucker
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
there
--
oh
the
problem
as
i
have
with
this
case
is
that
you
pointed
out
the
government
has
changed
its
argumentative
position.
you've
been
rather
consistent
in
yours.
but
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
either
yours
or
the
--
either
or
any
versions
of
the
government.
it
had
its
quite
a
different
theory
as
i
understand
it.
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
yours
and
just
tell
me
if
it's
this.
that
you
do
not
claim
that
the
approach
to
the
car,
parked
as
it
was
with
the
lights
on,
violated
anybody's
constitutional
rights
nor
indeed
the
interrogation
of
the
driver
to
the
extent
that
he
was
asked
to
provide
identification
of
himself.
that
that
violated
anybody's
rights.
but
that
your
point
is,
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong
is
that
after
he
did
so,
then
from
then
on
to
detain
him
and/or
to
search
his
car
violated
his
fourth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment
rights,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
the
court
of
appeals
then
adapted
the
theory
really.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
have
concentrated
on
what's
been
called
here
step
three.
justice
potter
stewart
they're
in
uniform?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
clear
that
on
the
other
hand
that
i
suppose
that
had
there
been
no
passengers
and
everything
else
had
transpired
as
it
did,
he'd
been
approached
and
given
his
identification,
there
wouldn't
be
no
question
about
his
freedom
to
leave
and
that's
your
case.
that's
the
point
of
your
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
the
knob
of
your
argument,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
be
that
as
it
may
mr.
beeler,
my
understanding
is
that
it
has
been
up
till
now
that
you
don't
object
to
the
policeman
approaching
the
car
or
interrogating
the
driver,
or
asking
him
for
his
identification
or
checking
his
identification.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
mean
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
further
assume
that
the
respondent
has
standing
to
it.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
adams.
