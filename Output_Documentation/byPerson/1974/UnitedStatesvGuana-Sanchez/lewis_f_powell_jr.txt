justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
beeler
does
the
record
show
that
mr.
sanchez
objected
to
the
brief
theory
of
detention?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
stewart,
reference
was
made
to
the
search.
what
search
do
you
have
in
mind?
what
do
you
think
constituted
a
search?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
it
have
been
different
as
has
been
suggested
if
these
four
individuals
had
been
walking
down
the
street
and
had
stopped
and
appeared
to
have
been
lost,
and
two
officers
had
come
up
and
said
“may
we
help
you?”
and
in
the
course
of
the
conversation,
the
officers
asked
questions
for
i.d.
cards.
would
that
be
a
different
case?
and
if
so,
where
is
the
search?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
a
speculation,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
beeler,
the
car
really
wasn't
just
on
the
side
of
the
road.
as
i
recall,
wasn't
it
20
--
15
to
20
feet
off
the
road
in
a
sort
of
vacant
area?
