justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
do
you
mean
when
you
--
you
don't
mean
to
lay
down
absolute
principle
that
he
has
the
right
to
use
the
public
highways
free
of
any
detention
whatsoever,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
not
insist
that
on
behalf
of
mr.
sanchez
that
other
people's
testimony
be
suppressed
because
those
other
people
weren't
given
miranda
warnings
can
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
if
a
witness
wasn't
given
a
miranda
warning,
his
statement
by
definition
is
not
voluntary
regardless
of
the
circumstances?
