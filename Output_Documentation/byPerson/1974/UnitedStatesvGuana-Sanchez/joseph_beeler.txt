mr.
joseph
beeler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
out
of
the
villa
park,
illinois
night
time
practice
and
procedure
of
demanding
satisfactory
proof
of
identity
from
everyone
encountered
in
that
suburb
in
an
automobile,
and
taking
those
persons
who
can't
produce
the
requested
identity
documents
to
the
police
station
to
see
whether
or
not
they
may
be
criminals.
and
frankly
a
little
disappointed
that
the
government
didn't
address
this
problem
a
little
bit
more
carefully.
that
here
we
have
an
extraordinary
dragnet
procedure
which
i
think
poses
great
threats
to
fourth
amendment
rights.
the
routine
in
this
case
is
so
comprehensive
that
the
police
in
villa
park
would
stop
and
demand
proof
of
identity
and
take
people
to
the
jail
to
see
if
the
might
be
criminals
that
they
were
merely
encountered
at
the
side
of
the
road
changing
an
obvious
flat
tire.
that's
the
kind
of
practice
that
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
beeler
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
testimony
in
the
case
that
if
everyone
in
the
car
that
has
all
four
passengers
had
had
identity
documents
satisfactory
to
the
police
officers,
then
they
could've
continued
on
their
business.
mr.
joseph
beeler
precisely
and
i
think
it's
important
that
the
court
take
careful
note
of
how
it
was
that
the
spanish
identity
of
these
passengers
was
learned.
if
this
was
something
that
was
paraded
on
the
outside
of
the
car,
something
that
the
police
knew
before
they
began
their
investigation,
and
before
they
detained
mr.
sanchez,
then
perhaps
assuming
that
there
had
been
some
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
police
officers
were
authorized
to
enforce
immigration
laws.
and
i'd
point
out
the
district
court
judge
held
on
that
holding
has
not
been
overturned
nor
the
government
challenged
it
here.
but
illinois
police
officers
are
not
vested
with
authority
to
investigate
immigration
offenses.
i
think
that
officer
tenudo
had
any
confidence
or
experience
that
was
meaningful
in
investigating
immigration
offenses,
if
he
knew
a
few
simple
things
like
whether
puerto
ricans
are
american
citizens
or
not.
we
were
able
to
recognize
mexicans.
with
his
own
testimony
was
that
he
couldn't
recognize
mexicans
that
he
couldn't
recognize
spanish.
so
we
have
the
circumstance
here
that
because
this
is
an
immigration
offense
doesn't
change
things
very
much.
i
mentioned
the
fact
that
the
police
learned
that
this
was
a
group
of
four
people,
three
of
whom
were
mexican
aliens
after
the
police
encounter
began.
the
government
in
its
statement
of
facts
suggests
that
there
is
a
question
as
to
when
the
police
radio
report
came
back
from
the
radio
dispatcher
indicating
that
mr.
sanchez
was
the
owner
of
the
motor
vehicle
and
that
the
motor
vehicle
was
not
stolen
or
wanted
in
connection
with
any
crime.
i
think
that
the
record
couldn't
be
clear.
after
all,
the
government's
own
witness,
mr.
tenudo
testified
that
it
came
back
immediately.
but
at
the
time
that
mr.
sanchez's
driver's
license
was
returned
to
him,
the
police
knew
there
was
absolutely
no
suspicion
connected
with
this
car.
i
would
point
out
that
i
believe
its
footnote
9
of
our
brief
deals
extensively
with
this
problem.
but
his
is
an
argument
which
the
government
has
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
supreme
court
on
its
brief
in
the
merits.
and
this
is
never
raised
the
question
below
as
to
when
this
radio
report
came
back.
and
i
think
the
court,
for
purposes
of
this
argument
at
least,
until
it
can
examine
the
footnote
carefully
should
assume
that
the
police
had
no
reasonable
suspicion
whatsoever
as
to
the
car.
and
whatever
reasonable
suspicion
they
may
have
had
initially
had
been
dispelled.
they
had
returned
the
driver's
license,
yet
rather
than
let
mr.
sanchez
drive
on
as
he
was
entitled
to,
they
testified
that
if
he
had
attempted
to
leave
at
that
time
they
would've
have
chased
after
him
and
pulled
him
off
again.
it
was
then
after
he
was
detained
in
what
we
submit
is
a
clear
violation
of
terry
versus
ohio,
since
there
was
no
basis
whatsoever
for
the
detention.
it
was
then
that
they
asked
the
passengers
if
they
wouldn't
produce
also.
and
it
was
then
and
only
then
that
they
learned
these
individuals
didn't
speak
english.
this
flowed
from
the
detention
of
mr.
sanchez.
this
is
the
second
stage
which
the
government
doesn't
want
to
talk
about.
but
this
is
what
the
defendant
has
been
arguing
ever
since
the
district
court.
we
have
not
changed
our
argument
one
wit.
the
government,
i
think
it
will
be
demonstrated,
has
been
over
the
lot.
the
defendant
in
this
case
has
standing,
which
is
the
only
issue
presented
in
the
cert
petition,
because
mr.
sanchez,
his
own
personal
constitutional
rights
were
violated.
he
has
a
right
to
use
the
public
highways
free
of
temporary
detention.
those
rights
were
violated
when
he
wasn't
free
to
move
on.
as
a
direct
result
of
this
dragnet
police
practice
in
violation
of
his
rights
--
mr.
joseph
beeler
what
i'm
talking
about
he
has
the
right
to
use
the
public
highways
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
subject
to
the
dictates
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
not
only
give
him
protection,
but
also
permit
reasonable
police
inquiry.
the
government
in
its
cert
petition
abandoned
their
argument
below,
as
i
read
the
cert
petition
and
as
i
read
the
brief
in
the
merits,
the
government
made
no
argument
that
they
could
justify
this
detention
under
terry
versus
ohio
or
adams
versus
williams.
the
first
time
that
i've
heard
that
argument
in
this
court
was
a
few
minutes
ago
when
mr.
friedman
brought
it
up.
i'd
point
out
that
the
government
is
here
as
the
petitioner.
they
bring
the
court
of
appeals
as
the
appellees
and
they
lost
in
the
district
court
where
they
had
the
burden
of
justifying
a
warrantless
arrest.
mr.
joseph
beeler
the
government's
proposed
testimony
is
that
these
three
witnesses
who
were
found
in
his
car
would
be
used
against
him
to
establish
the
elements
of
harboring
or
transporting.
mr.
joseph
beeler
that's
accurate.
that
is
the
proposed
testimony
should
this
court
reverse
the
judgments
below.
mr.
joseph
beeler
i
don't
believe
that's
accurate
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
beeler
the
government
would
like
to
argue
that.
i
believe
in
some
other
case,
there
cert
petition
says
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
standing.
and
they
state
expressly
in
their
cert
petition
that
this
case
does
not
represent
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
determining
the
question
which
i
think
you
might
be
getting
at.
when
or
whether
the
fruit,
rather
when
or
whether
the
testimony
of
the
witness
discovered
during
an
illegal
search
or
detention
is
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree.
and
i
think
the
reason
the
government
has
backed
away
from
that
issue
in
their
moving
papers
would
be
understood
if
i
could
read
an
excerpt
from
the
government's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals.
this
is
page
78,
i'm
sorry,
77
of
the
appendix
where
the
government
made
the
only
argument
that
they
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
that
is
that
the
police
procedure
in
this
case
was
lawful
and
proper.
it
was
a
justified
extension
of
terry
versus
ohio
and
adams
versus
williams.
and
they
made
the
argument
in
the
context
of
saying
that
the
brief
questioning
was
either
a
valid
investigatory
stop,
or
an
illegal
search.
and
here's
what
they
said.
this
is
the
very
first
sentence
and
their
very
first
paragraph.
“the
government
assumes
for
purposes
of
this
appeal
that
the
questioning
of
the
passengers
in
defendant's
car
constituted
a
search
of
the
car
to
which
defendant
has
standing
to
object.
the
government
also
concedes
that
the
testimony
of
witnesses
discovered
during
an
illegal
search
can
be
suppressed
as
to
a
person
has
standing
to
object
to
the
search.
the
issue
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
the
questioning
of
the
passengers
while
they
were
in
defendant's
car,
constituted
an
illegal
search
or
whether
it
was
a
proper
and
valid
investigatory
stop.”
mr.
joseph
beeler
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
but
i
think
the
litigation
posture
in
which
this
case
appears
is
important.
mr.
joseph
beeler
i
agree.
the
basic
issue
here
is
standing.
but
i
understand
the
question
of
standing
to
be
one
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights
his
own
constitutional
rights
were
violated
by
the
police
procedure,
and
having
established
in
the
district
court,
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
government's
briefs
on
the
merits
that
there
was
no
proper
basis
for
the
police
conduct
here.
and
i
think
it
being
almost
indisputable
that
mr.
sanchez
was
detained
so
that
this
police
procedure
could
be
carried
out.
i
think
establishes
standing,
his
rights
were
violated.
mr.
joseph
beeler
well,
if
i
understand
your
question
accurately,
you're
bringing
us
into
the
area
of
cases
which
seemed
to
take
a
case
by
case
analysis
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
particular
witnesses'
testimony
is
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
where
that
witness
was
discovered
as
a
result
of
some
police
illegality.
mr.
joseph
beeler
the
tucker
case
was
a
fifth
amendment
case
--
mr.
joseph
beeler
--
in
which
compulsion
is
an
important
question.
and
that's
the
harm
that
the
court
is
trying
to
safeguard
against,
but
that
is
an
instance.
mr.
joseph
beeler
well,
in
the
tucker
case,
this
court
held
that
the
witness
who
was,
rather
whose
identity
was
learned
as
a
result
of
the
custodial
interrogation
which
was
in
no
way
compulsive,
which
was
in
no
way
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
could
be
used
because
of
its
trustworthiness.
that
it
was
not
fruit
of
any
compulsion,
because
no
compulsion
was
present.
as
a
matter
of
fact
warnings
were
given
in
the
tucker
case.
there
was
just
a
technical
breach
of
miranda
versus
arizona.
mr.
joseph
beeler
i'm
--
i
think
that
it
might
well
be,
because
of
the
circumstances
in
which
their
custody
was
obtained
in
the
great
interest
that
they
would
have
inculpating
someone
else
in
order
escape
liability
themselves.
but
that's
--
i
think
the
compulsion
and
trustworthiness
question
is
one
that
you
worry
about
in
a
fifth
amendment
case.
but
in
case
after
case
of
fourth
amendment
violations,
the
court
is
excluded
probative
evidence.
they've
excluded
heroine,
guns
all
manner
of
physical
evidence
which
certainly
is
more
reliable
than
a
witness.
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice
about
cases
in
which
witnesses'
testimony
has
been
excluded.
i
would
refer
to
note
17
of
the
brief
of
the
amici
curiae.
and
also
in
our
memorandum
in
opposition,
we
listed
a
number
of
cases.
but
in
as
much
as
the
petition
for
certiorari
does
not
raise
the
fruit
question,
and
in
as
much
as
the
government
didn't
argue
it,
our
brief
on
the
merits
doesn't
take
up
that
question.
however,
to
assume
hypothetically,
there
is
a
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
question
in
front
of
this
court,
then
i
would
point
out
that
these
particular
witnesses
were
not
only
discovered
as
a
result
of
an
illegal
detention.
but
during
the
very
course
of
that
detention,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
illegality,
these
witnesses
and
their
status
as
spanish
speaking
individuals,
as
people
without
identification
cards
was
discovered.
furthermore,
these
witnesses
are
really
the
crux
of
the
government's
case.
he's
charged
with
possessing
them,
with
transporting
them
within
the
united
states.
the
obtaining
of
these
witnesses'
testimony
came
about
directly
by
exploitation
of
the
illegality.
the
dragnet
procedure
in
this
case
is
directed
purposefully
at
learning
about
identity
and
finding
criminals.
and
i
can't
see
a
clearer
connection
between
an
illegal
police
procedure
and
the
evidence
being
offered.
it's
very
difficult
to
see
how
the
paint
in
this
case
could
have
been
purged.
furthermore,
these
witnesses
gave
statements
immediately
upon
being
brought
to
the
police
station.
there
were
no
intervening
miranda
warnings
and
they
were
in
custody.
as
a
matter
fact,
the
record
shows
the
government
has
conceded
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
and
the
district
court
held
that
mr.
sanchez
too
was
arrested.
mr.
joseph
beeler
i
mentioned
the
miranda
warnings
simply
to
show
that
the
government
can
argue
that
the
statements
given
by
the
aliens
at
the
police
station
were
voluntary
or
something
that
or
a
product
of
their
individual
will,
memory,
perception,
volition,
factors
with
--
mr.
joseph
beeler
not
as
a
matter
of
law
but
i
think
it
bears
persuasively
upon
any
analysis
as
to
whether
or
not
these
witnesses
caught
in
a
foreign
country
in
the
middle
of
a
crime
being
interrogated
by
a
professional
interrogator
over
the
telephone,
somehow
came
forth
voluntarily
to
give
testimony
which
purged
the
taint,
their
being
discovered
during
the
illegality.
mr.
chief
justice
burger
who
was
sitting
then
as
a
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
district
columbia
in
the
case
of
smith
and
bowden
versus
united
states
which
is
at
324
f.2d,
pointed
out
that
the
witness
discovered
there
at
first
wouldn't
give
any
statements
and
wouldn't
cooperate.
and
then
later
on,
he
decided
to
cooperate.
and
this
was
seen
as
an
intervening
kind
of
factor.
but
the
government
which
had
the
burden
on
this
question
put
forward
no
evidence
of
an
intervening
guilty
plea,
of
an
intervening
voluntary
confession
or
any
other
independent
source
of
this
testimony.
if
the
testimony
of
a
witness
discovered
during
an
illegal
search
or
detention
can
ever
be
suppressed
as
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree,
why
then
we
submit
this
is
the
case.
mr.
joseph
beeler
that's
it.
i
would
add
one
other
thing.
the
district
court
as
a
matter
of
fact
did
adapt
our
theory.
in
the
district
court
opinion
i
believe
represents
the
argument
that
we're
making
here.
mr.
joseph
beeler
quite
frankly,
i
--
mr.
joseph
beeler
quite
frankly,
i
think
the
reason
the
government
petitioned
for
cert,
they
simply
didn't
like
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
written.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
would've
folded
an
opinion
written
like
the
district
court's
opinion,
because
it
made
clear
findings
of
fact
that
mr.
sanchez
was
detained
after
his
driver's
license
had
been
returned
and
prior
to
the
interrogation
of
his
passengers.
that
this
violated
his
own
fourth
amendment
rights.
and
the
district
court
opinion
talked
about
detention
as
well
as
a
search.
and
it
didn't
feel
the
semantic
labels
were
important.
what
was
important
was
that
there
was
an
interference
with
the
individual's
own
constitutional
rights.
the
government
appears
also
not
to
be
entirely
satisfied
with
the
district
court's
fact
finding.
but
it
hasn't
come
out
and
said
that
“gee,
the
district
court
was
clearly
erroneous.
and
these
are
the
reasons
why
and
here's
the
case
law
showing
why?”
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
shows
that
the
district
court
agonized
over
the
question
of
when
the
detention
occurred.
and
he
came
to
the
conclusion
and
made
fully
supportable
fact
finding
that
the
detention
of
mr.
sanchez
occurred
after
his
driver's
license
was
returned.
and
that
all
four,
not
just
three
were
arrested
when
they
were
brought
to
the
police
station.
the
government
--
mr.
joseph
beeler
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
made
any
protest.
the
record,
i
believe
would
show
that
he
acquiesced.
however,
he
had
submitted
to
a
demand
for
proof
of
identity
from
these
law
enforcement
officers
who
came
up
to
his
car.
one
stationed
himself
at
his
window.
one
stationed
himself
at
the
other
window.
mr.
joseph
beeler
they
were
in
uniform.
they
were
armed.
they
were
carrying
chemical
mace.
it
was
2:30
in
the
morning
which
cuts
two
ways.
the
government
made
no
showing
that
it's
unusual
for
people
to
be
in
the
suburb
of
villa
park
looking
at
a
map
and
hunting
for
a
restaurant
at
that
time
of
night.
but
when
two
police
officers
come
up
on
either
side
and
they
offer
to
help
you
find
a
restaurant.
then
after
that,
they
demand
some
proof
of
identity.
and
when
they
carry
on
this
kind
of
procedure,
i
think
it's
--
it's
not
in
the
record
other
than
that
mr.
sanchez
is
a
mexican-american.
but
i
--
mr.
joseph
beeler
in
addition
to
the
detention
of
mr.
sanchez,
which
resulted
in
the
discovery
of
the
witnesses,
the
procedure
of
interrogating
the
passengers
can
also
be
viewed
as
a
search
during
the
period
of
this
detention.
they
are
simultaneous
search
and
detention.
the
government
conceded
and
the
court
of
appeals
once
again
that
this
would
constitute
a
search.
i
think
by
any
standards,
it
is
a
search.
the
police
officers
were
asking
question
to
learn
things
that
were
not
in
plain
view.
the
identity
of
these
witnesses
was
in
no
sense
in
plain
view
anymore
than
the
contents
inside
a
paper
bag
are
in
plain
view.
mr.
joseph
beeler
assuming
that
all
of
the
other
facts
would
be
about
the
same
then
we
would
assume
that
mr.
sanchez
was
in
custody.
he
wasn't
free
to
leave
while
his
three
companions
were
being
interrogated.
that
if
he
did
attempt
to
leave,
he
would've
been
pursued
and
recaptured.
mr.
joseph
beeler
well
that
would
make
your
hypothetical
equivalent
to
the
situation
that
we
do
have
in
this
case.
the
law
enforcement
officer
made
it
quite
clear
that
he
was
going
to
hold
mr.
sanchez
there
until
this
routine
was
completed.
but
he
wasn't
free
to
drive
off.
mr.
joseph
beeler
that's
what
mr.
friedman
says.
that's
not
in
the
record
anywhere.
the
record
shows
that
if
mr.
sanchez
had
attempted
to
leave,
and
my
question
contains
no
reference
to
the
passengers
in
the
car
or
out
of
the
car.
if
mr.
sanchez
had
attempted
to
leave,
they
would
have
chased
after
him
and
now
i'm
quoting
“pulled
him
off
again”.
i
think
from
this
kind
of
testimony
and
from
the
district
court's
finding
upon
a
very
careful
analysis.
just
--
what
was
going
through
the
police
officers
minds?
he
was
in
custody.
he
couldn't
go
anywhere.
he
was
held
under
terry
versus
ohio
standards.
mr.
joseph
beeler
if
there
had
been
no
passengers,
he
could've
driven
right
off.
mr.
joseph
beeler
once
he
proved
his
own
identity.
mr.
joseph
beeler
that's
the
knob
of
it.
mr.
joseph
beeler
there
was
no
testimony
that
they
distinguished.
there
was
the
fact
that
mr.
sanchez
was
used
to
transport
--
mr.
joseph
beeler
--
one
of
the
passengers
physically.
they
went
on
a
convoy,
and
so
it
was
obvious
that
mr.
sanchez
probably
couldn't
have
taken
off.
the
district
court
found
that
they
were
arrested.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
all
four
of
them
were
arrested,
and
the
government
concedes
in
all
their
briefs.
and
up
until
right
now
that
they
were
arrested.
so,
i
don't
think
it
makes
much
difference
what
cars
they
were
put
in
or
how
the
police
arranged
for
their
particular
custody.
the
point
was
that
mr.
sanchez
was
driving
to
a
police
station,
instead
of
to
a
restaurant
which
was
his
choice.
to
return,
if
i
could
just
briefly
to
mr.
justice
powell's
hypothetical.
i
think
the
important
factor
of
the
sidewalk
situation
would
be
a
question
of
whether
or
not
mr.
sanchez
would
have
to
be
detained
and
stay
there
while
the
police
conducted
their
identity
search
to
the
people
that
he
was
with.
and
if
he
was
held
with
them
either
by
a
command
or
by
some
type
of
physical
act
of
being
in
a
situation
where
he
couldn't
get
out,
he
was
held
in
like
he
would
be
in
a
car.
let's
say
he
was
in
a
dead
end
alley
and
he
couldn't
get
out
until
the
police
were
done.
by
then
the
detention
factor
is
the
same.
in
terms
of
a
search,
well
it's
not
a
search
of
his
car
in
that
case.
there
is
no
car
in
that
hypothetical.
but
nonetheless,
it's
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
and
that's
the
central
violation
that
we're
focusing
in
on
this
case.
we
believe
that
this
case
stands
for
the
freedom
of
people
to
move
on
the
highways
without
being
subjected
to
unconstitutional
violation
of
their
freedom
of
travel.
mr.
joseph
beeler
he
was
parked
for
the
purpose
of
a
brief
stop
in
his
travel
to
get
his
bearings
to
the
restaurant
he
was
looking
for.
mr.
joseph
beeler
not
initially.
but
once
it
was
detained
for
practical
purpose
that
is
an
interruption.
instead
of
ending
out
at
the
restaurant
or
ending
up
in
the
restaurant
a
little
bit
late,
which
i
would
consider
to
be
an
interruption
of
travel,
it
was
almost
inevitable.
mr.
joseph
beeler
villa
park
isn't
such
a
tiny
little
town.
it's
25,000
to
30,000
people
in
a
suburb
west
of
chicago.
one
suburb
is
packed
up
against
another.
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
taken
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
defendant,
which
it
must
be,
we're
here
as
the
appellees
and
as
the
respondent.
mr.
joseph
beeler
mr.
justice
powell,
it
was
in
a
cut-off
between
north
and
adison
rd.,
and
i've
obtained
defendant's
exhibit
a
which
i
thought
had
been
transmitted
to
the
supreme
court
earlier.
but
when
i
checked
with
the
marshall's
office,
it
hadn't
come.
and
that
exhibit
which
is
a
photograph,
i'm
sure
it
will
be
available
from
the
marshal.
it
shows
as
our
brief
asserts
that
this
was
a
perfectly
logical
normal
place
for
one
to
pull
off
the
road
to
read
a
map.
the
police
office
in
the
case
testified
as
to
no
suspicion
about
where
the
car
was
parked.
there
was
no
parking
citation.
and
i
don't
think
the
location
of
the
car
is
any
part
of
the
case
as
it
reaches
this
court.
mr.
joseph
beeler
you're
right.
we
felt
that
there's
no
reason
to
raise
that.
mr.
joseph
beeler
as
i
understand
the
record,
after
the
four
arrived
at
the
police
station
and
they
were
“brought
inside”,
which
is
to
use
the
words
chosen
by
the
police
officer.
then
while
the
interrogation
was
going
on
in
the
police
station,
there
was
simultaneously
a
search
being
made
of
mr.
sanchez'
automobile.
evidently,
it's
the
kind
of
search
that
would
include
the
search
of
the
trunk.
except
he
of
course
had
a
station
wagon.
search
of
the
glove
compartment,
search
of
any
hiding
area
in
the
car.
mr.
joseph
beeler
there
was
--
it's
not
in
the
record
but
in
direct
answer
to
your
question,
represented
by
different
counsel,
mr.
sanchez
pleaded
guilty
to
the
illinois
violation
of
possessing
a
firearm
without
having
registered
it.
and
he
received
probation
and
a
fine
for
that
offense.
also,
i
would
add
for
the
record
and
it
does
appear
on
sworn
from
counsel
and
the
transcript.
the
firearm
was
a
gift
he
had
received
from
an
uncle
in
texas
which
he
had
just
brought
in
to
illinois,
and
there
was
no
opportunity
to
register
it.
but
i
also
agree
with
your
suggestion
that
that's
not
part
of
this
case
as
it
arrives
here.
thank
you.
