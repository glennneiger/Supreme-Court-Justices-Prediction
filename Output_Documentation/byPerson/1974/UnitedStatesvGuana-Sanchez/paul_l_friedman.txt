mr.
paul
l.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
respondent
was
charged
in
a
one-count
indictment
filed
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
for
having
knowingly
and
unlawfully
transported
three
aliens
within
the
united
states
in
violation
of
title
8,
united
states
code,
section
132482.
he
filed
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
evidence
alleging
that
he
and
his
three
passengers
had
been
illegally
arrested
while
in
his
car,
and
of
the
government's
evidence
depended
upon
the
testimony
of
the
passengers,
which
he
said
was
the
fruit
of
the
illegal
arrest.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
to
suppress
the
statements
made
by
the
passengers
and
their
future
testimony
at
respondent's
trial.
the
government
appealed
the
decision,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court
with
one
judge
dissenting.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
yes,
i'm
going
to
go
through
the
facts
in
some
detail
because
i
think
it's
very
important
to
the
resolution
of
the
case.
the
issue
on
which
we
petitioned,
is
whether
a
defendant
has
standing
to
suppress
statements
and
future
testimony
of
witnesses
on
the
ground
that
they
were
unlawfully
arrested
while
passengers
in
his
automobile.
the
statements,
i
might
say,
took
place
later
when
they
got
down
to
the
police
station.
but
the
facts
of
the
suppression
hearing
briefly
show
the
following,
i
might
add
that
they
came
solely
from
a
police.
he'd
being
the
only
the
witness
at
the
suppression
hearing.
he
testified
that
he,
officer
pat
vincent
tenudo
was
a
police
officer
in
the
village
of
villa
park,
illinois
some
17
miles
west
of
chicago,
that
that
was
a
small
village
of
25,000
to
30,000
people,
about
half
residential
and
half
industrial
and
that
the
industry
consisted
of
small
factories
and
businesses.
he
also
testified
that
the
factories,
some
of
them,
often
looked
for
cheap
labor
and
he
related
three
experiences
of
his
own
when
he
was
involved
in
helping
the
checkout
of
individuals
who've
turned
out
to
be
illegal
entrants
from
mexico,
who
would
apparently
come
to
the
area
to
work
in
the
factories.
in
each
case,
those
people
have
no
identification,
spoke
no
english
and
had
arrived
in
the
area
either
by
car,
bus
or
truck.
now
in
this
particular
night,
he
and
his
partner
at
about
2:30
in
the
morning
did
not
stop
a
vehicle.
they
saw
a
vehicle
already
stopped,
pulled
over
to
the
side
of
the
road
in
the
vacant
lot
at
an
intersection
about
15
or
20
miles
off
the
road.
the
lights
of
the
car,
the
headlights
were
on.
the
interior
dome
light
was
on.
the
officers
went
over
to
see
if
they
could
be
of
assistance
to
see
if
these
people
were
lost.
it
appeared
to
them
the
driver
was
looking
at
a
piece
of
paper
which
may
have
been
a
map.
and
indeed
when
they
drove
over
to
the
car,
they
saw
respondent
sitting
behind
the
steering
wheel
on
the
driver
side
looking
at
an
illinois
road
map.
three
other
people
were
in
the
car.
one
beside
the
driver
in
the
front
seat,
two
in
the
back
seat,
on
the
floor
of
the
car
were
three
shopping
bags
containing
what
appeared
to
be
items
of
clothing.
the
officers
before
talking
to
the
respondent
and
his
passengers
radioed
in
their
location
to
headquarters
and
radioed
in
the
license
tag
number
of
the
car.
officer
hall
went
over
to
the
driver's
side.
officer
tenudo
went
to
the
passenger
side.
officer
hall
asked
the
respondent
if
they
could
be
of
any
help
with
the
problem
was.
respondent
said
they
were
looking
for
a
restaurant
owned
by
a
friend,
but
he
didn't
know
the
name
of
the
restaurant.
they
couldn't
find
that
restaurant.
they
were
looking
for
another
restaurant
which
he
did
name.
one
of
the
officers
radioed
in
to
some
of
the
neighboring
towns,
and
from
those
towns
found
out
at
least
that
the
restaurant
in
the
area
closed
by
midnight
or
1
o'clock.
although
not
necessarily
all
the
restaurants
closed
by
midnight
or
1
o'clock.
at
this
point,
officer
hall
asked
respondent
for
some
identification.
he
showed
the
officer
what
appeared
to
be
and
apparently
valid
illinois
driver's
license.
now
either
at
about
that
same
time
or
later
when
they
got
back
to
the
station,
although
we
don't
think
it's
particularly
important
which.
the
radio
dispatcher
informed
to
the
officers
that
they
had
checked
out
the
license
tag
number.
the
car
belonged
to
the
same
individual
whose
name
appeared
on
the
license.
the
car
was
not
stolen.
it
was
not
wanted
in
connection
with
any
particular
crime.
the
officer,
after
checking
the
driver's
license,
asked
the
passengers
for
identification.
they
shrugged
their
shoulders
as
if
they
didn't
understand
the
question.
the
officer
repeated
the
question.
he
got
the
same
response.
he
then
asked
the
driver
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
the
question
to
the
passengers
was
“do
you
have
any
identification?”
and
the
passengers
indicated
by
gesture
that
they
didn't
understand.
he
then,
the
officer,
asked
respondent
whether
he
spoke
spanish.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
the
respondent
was
the
driver,
the
other
three,
passengers
in
his
car.
he
asked
him
if
he
spoke
spanish
and
if
he
would
ask
the
passengers
for
identification.
the
respondent
said
something
to
the
three
passengers
in
a
language
the
officers
did
not
understand.
they
assumed
it
to
be
spanish.
in
response
to
the
respondent's
inquiry,
the
two
people
in
the
back
shook
their
heads
back
and
forth
as
if
to
indicate,
no
they
had
no
identification,
assuming
that
was
the
question
asked
by
the
driver.
the
gentleman
in
the
front
seat
handed
the
officers
a
little
card
written
in
a
foreign
language
which
appeared
to
be
spanish.
the
officers
couldn't
read
except
to
make
out
three
words,
army,
military
and
mexico.
they
assumed
that
that
--
they
concluded
that
that
meant
that
the
--
that
was
an
army
identification
card
from
mexico.
they
called
their
sergeant.
the
sergeant
arrived
a
few
minutes
later.
through
respondent,
asked
the
two
passengers
in
the
back
seat,
the
two
without
identification,
to
get
out
of
the
car
and
to
come
to
the
police
station.
they
placed
them
in
a
police
vehicle
to
transport
them
to
the
station.
at
that
point,
officer
hall
asked
respondent
if
he
wouldn't
mind
coming
to
the
station
while
a
check
was
done
on
the
two
persons
without
identification.
respondent
answered
“fine,
i
will
come
with
you.”
and
along
with
the
passenger
who
had
shown
identification,
he
followed
the
officers
to
the
station
in
his
own
car.
at
no
time
prior
to
the
trip
to
the
station
did
any
police
officer
enter
the
car
or
search
the
car.
and
when
they
got
to
the
station,
the
sergeant
asked
the
three
passengers,
again
through
respondent,
if
they
would
write
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
their
names
and
their
ages.
he
then
called
the
local
office
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
to
run
a
name
check
on
these
three
people,
and
chief
parton
of
that
service
asked
to
speak
with
the
three
passengers.
he
spoke
with
each
of
them
in
spanish,
but
what
sounded
to
the
officers
to
be
spanish.
and
after
speaking
with
them,
told
the
sergeant
to
hold
off
four
men
until
morning,
because
the
three
men
had
admitted
that
they
were
in
the
country
illegally.
now,
just
to
round
out
the
picture
of
what
happened
at
the
hearing,
in
response
to
some
hypothetical
questions
from
court
and
counsel,
the
officer
testified
that
if
respondent
had
driven
off
without
asking
permission
after
having
shown
his
driver's
license
but
with
the
unidentified
persons
still
on
the
car,
he
would've
been
stopped.
he
also
testified
however
that
if
he
had
refused
to
come
to
the
station
when
asked,
respondent
would've
been
free
to
leave,
his
license
having
been
checked
out
and
there
being
no
further
reason
to
detain
him.
the
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
free
to
leave
alone.
not
with
his
passengers,
at
least
that's
certainly
the
implication
of
the
officer's
answer.
and
the
inference
we
draw
from
those
two
inquiries
answered
is
that
he
would've
been
detained
if
he
tried
to
leave
with
the
passengers,
because
they
hadn't
been
checked
out.
but
he
would've
been
free
to
leave
alone.
now
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
to
suppress.
he
found
that
the
license
check
was
reasonable,
but
anything
thereafter
was
unreasonable.
no
need
--
no
justification
to
detain
them
further
and
to
interrogate
the
passengers.
he
found
that
the
interrogation
constituted
the
search
of
the
car,
even
though
the
passengers
were
in
plain
view.
and
solely
for
the
purposes
of
challenging
finding,
and
that
some
illegality
flowed
from
it,
we
assumed
arguendo
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
was
a
search,
but
the
whole
incident
at
the
car
was
lawful.
and
he
also
said
that
the
arrest
of
respondent
and
his
passengers
were
unlawful
and
that
everything
that
flowed
were
fruits
and
should
be
suppressed.
now
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
what
it
did,
and
we
think
its'
important
for
analysis,
is
it
said
there
were
three
steps
in
the
facts
as
they
developed.
the
first
step
was
the
license
check
and
that
was
perfectly
reasonable
and
justified.
the
second
step
was
the
period
beginning
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
of
the
driver's
license.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
the
respondent's
license
alone.
the
second
step
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
began
when
the
driver
was
given
his
license
back,
and
everything
else
that
happened
at
the
car,
the
interrogation
of
the
passengers,
was
the
second
steps,
said
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
third
step
was
the
period
beginning
with
the
trip
to
the
police
station.
now
the
problem,
as
the
case
comes
here
we
think,
is
that
while
the
court
said
the
first
step
was
reasonable
and
the
third
step
wasn't.
it
didn't
talk
about
the
second
step.
it
moved
immediately
to
the
third
step
and
said
that
that
was
an
unlawful
arrest
taking
them
to
the
station.
that
respondent
was
unlawfully
arrested,
and
that
everything
that
flowed
was
fruits
of
that.
now
the
dissenting
judge,
also
addressing
himself
to
that
first,
said
that
he
thought
everything
was
reasonable.
but
then
went
on
to
say
“if
we're
talking
about
the
respondent's
arrest,
respondent's
got
no
standing
‘coz
nothing
flowed
from
that.
and
secondly,
that
even
assuming
some
illegality,
live
witness
testimony
should
be
treated
differently
for
purposes
of
the
exclusionary
rule
from
inanimate
objects.”
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it's
our
position
that
--
we're
talking
about
when
they
left
the
car?
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it's
our
position
that
respondent
was
not
arrested.
but
that
even
if
he
was,
there
were
no
fruits
of
his
arrest.
the
only
fruits
in
this
case
come
from
the
arrests
if
they
were
arrested.
and
we're
not
sure
that
they
were
arrested
either,
frankly.
we
think
it
may
have
been
a
reasonable
detention
in
the
circumstances
or
that
it
may
have
been
an
arrest
on
probable
cause.
but
in
any
event,
anything
that
flowed,
the
statements
and
the
future
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
flowed
from
the
arrest
of
the
passengers,
not
the
arrest
of
respondent.
and
that's
essentially
the
only
question
on
which
we
petition
the
court
and
the
only
question
that
we
think
it's
necessary
to
decide,
because
any
illegality
in
that
second
step
which
respondent
talks
about
in
his
brief,
was
not
directly
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
think
it
might
be
appropriate
to
let
that
court
address
it
first.
although
we
also
think
that
it's
inferable
from
the
court's
opinion
that
everything
in
that
second
step
was
also
reasonable,
because
it
said
the
only
illegality
that
held
that
the
only
thing
was
illegal
were
the
arrest
taking
them
down
to
the
station.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no,
there
was
not.
well,
essentially
as
they
said,
they're
no
fruits
of
respondent's
arrest,
if
we
deal
solely
with
that
third
step
in
the
facts.
no
statements
were
made
by
respondent.
no
evidence
came
from
respondent.
nothing
was
seized
from
respondent.
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
made
its
mistake
by
not
isolating
what
were
four
separate
human
beings
and
looking
at
what
happened
to
each
of
those
separate
human
beings.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
they
would
let
him
go
right
away.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
we're
assuming
that
it's
reasonable
to
ask
passengers
in
a
car
to
identify
themselves.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
we
would
not
concede
he
was
being
held
at
all.
there
is
nothing
to
say
that
he
couldn't
have
left
at
that
point.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
no,
what
the
officer
said
in
his
testimony
was
that
he
wouldn't
be
permitted
to
leave
so
long
as
the
passengers
were
still
with
him.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
but
if
the
passengers
had
been
separated
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
i
think
it's
difficult
to
assume
that
you
have
no
business
holding
them
for
the
brief
time
it
would
take
to
get
them
out
of
his
car.
i
think
that
what
could
easily
happen
is
the
officer
saying
“we
have
business
with
the
passengers.
you've
got
no
interest
in
those
passengers,
they're
other
human
beings.
they
are
not
briefcases.
they
are
not
papers.”
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
if
four
people
are
walking
down
the
street
and
there's
reason
to
arrest
three
of
them,
you
can
take
those
three
people
and
separate
them
from
the
other
individual.
now
it
doesn't
seem
to
us
any
different
if
four
people
happen
to
be
in
a
car.
does
it
mean
that
if
there's
reason
to
arrest
three
of
them,
you
have
to
arrest
all
four
of
them
just
because
they
happen
to
be
on
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
that
you
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
we
think
that
the
right
to
go
up
to
some
individuals,
whether
they
be
on
a
street
or
in
an
automobile
and
ask
them
some
questions.
there's
a
footnote
in
terry
versus
ohio.
i
don't
think
you
need
reasonable
suspicion
to
do
that.
does
your
concurring
opinion
in
terry
versus
ohio?
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
there's
a
case
in
the
--
i
remember
a
lot
of
stop
cases
of
course,
but
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
we
don't
think
that
that
point
is
in
this
case.
we
think
that
since
the
court
of
appeals
only
dealt
with
the
arrests
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
deal
with
anything
that
happened
in
that
car
and
say
it
was
illegal.
and
of
course
this
court
could
do
so
if
it
wanted
to.
what
it
talked
about
was
the
arrest
and
what
flowed
from
the
arrest.
we
say
nothing
flowed
from
the
arrest.
now
if
we
go
back
to
step
two
at
the
car,
what
flowed,
flowed
from
the
interrogation
of
the
passengers.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
then
we
think
it's
certainly
arguable
that
he's
got
standing
to
complain.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
but
the
car
is
a
protected
area.
and
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that's
correct.
and
so
far
as
we
know
it
was
never
charged
for
that.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i'm
not
sure
that
the
answer
to
that
is
clear
because
i
think
you
then
get
to
this
whole
question
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
i
don't
think
they
seized
them
out
of
the
car.
they
didn't
get
into
the
car
as
they
go
into
the
house
in
your
example.
they
asked
people
to
get
out
of
the
car.
they
have
a
right
to
arrest
people
whether
they
be
on
the
street
or
on
the
car,
if
there's
probable
cause.
they
have
a
right
to
interrogate
people
whether
they
be
on
the
street
or
in
the
car
if
there
there's
reasonable
suspicion,
or
in
the
case
of
a
license
check,
maybe
even
if
there's
not
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
suggest
that.
although
i
don't
think
it's
important
in
this
case.
i
think
that
everything
the
police
did
step
by
step
was
reasonable
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
they
stopped
the
car
at
2:30
a.m.,
and
all
of
these
times
were
accurate
because
they're
recorded
in
the
radio
log.
they
were
down
to
the
police
station
by
2:47
a.m.,
so
it's
17
minutes
for
the
entire
process
to
find
out
that
they
were
illegally
in
the
country.
but
only
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that's
correct.
the
2:33
--
2:30
they
saw
the
car.
2:33
they
drove
to
where
the
car
was
parked.
at
2:37,
the
sergeant
was
on
the
scene
already.
and
at
2:47
they
were
at
the
police
station,
2:46,
16
minutes.
now,
the
radio
log
which
was
put
in
evidence,
i
believe
by
the
defendant
at
the
hearing,
corroborates
all
of
those
times,
a
very
short
period
of
time
that
we're
talking.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it's
a
small
town,
and
it's
not
that
far
to
the
police
station
apparently.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
the
radio
log
is,
yes.
so
that's
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
the
police
kept
it
at
my
recollection.
am
i
wrong?
i'm
sorry.
i'm
advised
that
i'm
wrong.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i'm
told
that
that's
not
correct.
i
think
where
i
got
confused
was
we've
had
some
disagreements
during
the
litigation
about
what
the
log
said
about
when
the
radio
report
came
back.
but,
alright,
the
government
put
it
in
evidence.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
i
would
say,
you
know
it's
not
entirely
clear
that
it's
satisfactory.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
but
--
well
in
fairness,
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
record
is
unclear
whether
they
would've
turned
him
loose.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
they
would've
turned
the
driver
loose.
they
asked
the
driver
to
follow
down.
they
asked
the
man
to
follow
along
with
the
drive.
they
didn't
take
him
to
a
police
vehicle.
i
don't
think
that
the
evidence
makes
clear
what
they
would've
done
if
the
man
with
the
mexican
i.d.
card
wanted
to
leave.
but
their
purpose
they
say,
and
it's
uncontradicted,
was
to
check
out
the
other
two
people
in
the
back
who
had
no
identification
at
least
to
the
same
extent
that
they
checked
out
the
man
on
the
front
seat.
and
they
had
to
take
them
down
to
the
station
to
do
it.
now,
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
when
they
checked
with
immigration
naturalization,
they
gave
them
all
three
names.
and
they
had
all
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
that
it's
arguable
that
all
three
of
them
were
in
custody.
now
the
question
is
were
they
lawfully
in
custody
or
not,
if
you
want
to
get
to
that
point?
and
if
it
was
reasonable
to
do
the
license
check,
and
if
it
was
reasonable
to
ask
the
passengers
for
identification,
then
given
the
fact
that
they
spoke
no
english,
given
the
fact
that
they
were
mexican
appearing,
given
the
fact
that
there
were
these
bags
of
clothing
in
the
car,
given
the
fact
it
was
2:30
in
the
morning
in
an
exclusively
industrial
area
and
given
the
officers
prior
experience
in
similar
situations.
we
think
step
by
step
it
was
reasonable.
the
intrusions
were
minimal
into
these
peoples
privacy.
and
they
were
checking
out
identifications.
asking
for
a
name
and
address
is
at
least
the
plurality
of
the
court
one
said,
and
i
think
byers
versus
california,
asking
for
name
and
address
is
essentially
a
neutral
act.
there
are
other
cases
i
mentioned,
miranda
and
the
concurring
opinion
and
the
footnote
in
terry.
the
miranda
itself
and
the
terry
and
the
concurring
opinion
asking
questions
of
people
in
the
street
to
get
identification,
adams
versus
williams
is
a
reasonable
act.
now
how
and
what
the
quantum
of
facts
one
has
to
have
as
a
police
officer
to
ask
those
questions
is
a
sliding
scale.
and
if
you
look
at
this
thing
step
by
step,
we
think
everything
that
they
did
is
reasonable.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
we
still
think
it's
that
narrow
issue.
if
you
focus
on
step
three,
we
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
the
arrest
of
the
four
individuals,
assuming
they
were
arrested
or
the
detention
should
be
viewed
separately.
and
everything
that
flowed,
flowed
from
the
arrests,
putting
it
in
quotes
for
now,
of
the
passengers
not
of
the
driver.
their
statements,
their
future
testimony
flowed
from
that.
had
they
been
--
had
the
driver
been
arrested
separately,
there
would've
been
no
fruits.
had
the
passengers
been
arrested
separately
and
everything
else
followed
the
way
it
did
here,
clearly
the
driver
would
have
no
standing
even
though
they
incriminated
him.
we
think
the
dissenting
judge
summed
it
up
pretty
well
when
he
said
that
while
the
passengers
may
have
been
agreed,
the
driver
was
not.
and
the
driver
has
no
interest
in
bodies
or
the
minds
of
his
passengers.
that
we
think
is
the
narrow
issue
before
the
court.
should
the
court
feel
it
appropriate
to
get
in
to
that
second
stage
which
the
court
of
appeals
identified
but
did
not
discuss,
we
think
there
are
three
independent
reasons
which
would
support
reversal
here,
one
that
everything
was
reasonable
and
i
talked
about
that
briefly
in
capsulized
form.
two
that
the
same
standing
principles
applied
here
would
lead
one
to
the
conclusion
that
the
respondent
still
has
no
standing.
everything
flowed
from
the
passengers.
his
rights
were
not
infringed.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
step
two.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
if
we
want
to
talk
about
step
two.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
i'm
talking
about
it
because
i
think
that
some
people
would
like
to
talk
about
it,
but
if
you
talk
about
that.
we
still
think
the
same
standing
principles
would
preclude
him
from
being
heard
and
complaining
about
this.
and
we
also
think
at
that
point,
it
maybe
appropriate,
although
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
get
to
this
question
which
we
mentioned
in
the
footnote
and
which
the
dissenting
judge
discussed,
and
which
the
chief
justice
discussed
in
numerous
opinions
when
on
the
court
of
appeals.
and
that
is
that
live
witnesses
ought
to
be
treated
differently
from
any
animate
objects.
that
essentially
is
our
position.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
just
a
couple
of
minor
points,
first
on
our
concession
and
all
of
that.
i
think
that
it's
--
first
of
all,
it's
not
a
concession,
it's
an
assumption
for
the
purposes
of
argument
and
what
happened
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
in
the
court
of
appeals
which
we
don't
feel
bound
by
here
is,
the
district
court
reached
a
conclusion
that
the
interrogation
was
a
search.
and
so
for
purposes
of
argument
we
said
“let's
assume
that
it
was
a
search.
now
let's
go
on
and
talk
about
whether
it
was
reasonable
or
not.”
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
has
standing
at
that
point
if
it
were
a
search.
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
discuss
step
two,
they
went
to
step
three.
well,
now
we're
talking
about
step
three
and
that
assumption
has
nothing
to
do
with
step
three,
and
should
this
court
want
to
take
a
look
at
step
two,
we
don't
feel
bound
by
that
assumption.
we
feel
free
to
argue
that
the
conduct
was
reasonable,
that
there
was
no
standing.
that
live
witnesses
are
different
from
physical
evidence
and
so
on.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
it's
got
to
go
back
either
with
this
court
looking
at
some
of
those
other
aspects
or
asking
--
telling
the
court
of
appeals
to
look
at
some
of
those
other
aspects.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
to
clarify
what
went
on,
on
that
second
stage.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question
a
little
while
ago
about,
didn't
the
officer
testify
but
he
only
took
him
down
because
passengers
were
still
with
them?
well
the
question
by
mr.
beeler
in
page
63
of
the
appendix
was
not
what
you
would've
done
with
the
respondent
at
any
stage.
but
he
said
“back
at
north
and
adison,
after
you
and
officer
hall
had
gone
over
to
the
defendant's
car
and
after
officer
hall
had
asked
the
defendant
for
an
i.d.,
and
after
the
defendant
had
produced
his
driver's
license,
and
after
officer
hall
had
returned
the
driver's
license.
what
would
you
and
officer
hall
had
done
if
the
defendant
then
drove
off
immediately
in
his
car
without
asking
your
permission?”
so
we
think
that
the
officer's
answered
that
he
would've
given
chase
is
perfectly
consistent
with
his
later
testimony
that
later
on
would've
let
the
defendant
--
the
respondent
go
once
he
had
had
those
passengers
and
once
he
was
beginning
to
find
out
something
about
the
passengers.
the
point
is,
so
long
as
the
passengers
were
with
him
and
he
hadn't
checked
them
out,
he
was
stopping
to
get
those
passengers.
but
the
respondent
was
not
being
detained
for
any
purposes
directed
at
the
respondent.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
he
said
“fine,
i'll
come
along.”
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
it's
also
2:30
in
the
morning
when
you're
looking
for
a
restaurant
and
the
police
come
over
and
they
don't
say
“you're
coming
with
us.”
they
come
over
and
say
“can
we
help
you
find
the
restaurant?
what
seems
to
be
the
trouble?”
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
i
think
frankly
that
you
have
to
look
at
it
step
by
step.
and
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
what
i
would've
done
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
under
the
circumstances,
i
probably
would've
felt
that
there
was
no
reason
not
to
go
along.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
but
that
doesn't
make
it
an
arrest.
that
doesn't
make
it
an
arrest.
and
i'm
reminded,
mainly
because
i
have
it
written
in
front
of
me
here,
a
concurring
opinion
by
judge
levanthol
at
one
point.
where
he
said
“in
a
walking
up
and
asking
questions
in
a
case
called
bailey
versus
united
states,
is
not
an
arrest.
while
most
people
might
feel
they
are
not
free
to
go.
but
the
difficult
question
is
whether
in
the
face
of
a
specific
refusal
to
answer
questions
or
a
specific
request
to
go,
would
there
then
have
become
an
arrest?”
here
there
was
no
specific
refusal,
no
specific
request
to
go.
and
in
this
case
ought
not
to
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
they
were
being
detained
at
that
time.
whether
they
were
being
detained
on
reasonable
suspicion
or
being
arrested
on
probable
cause
is
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
--
arguable.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
i
think
that
you
can
view
the
facts
on
two
different
ways
in
regard
of
the
passengers.
either
they
were
being
detained
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
okay,
let's
say
it's
an
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
don't
think
they're
all
in
the
same
position.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
there's
no
evidence
of
anything
like
that
in
the
setting
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
that
what
happened
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
would
you
mind
coming
along
is
different
from
getting
in
the
back
of
a
squad
car.
and
i
think
that
what's
happened
here
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
pardon
me?
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
i
think
it
depends
how
it's
said.
i
think
it
depends
what's
gone
before.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
we
know
what
went
before.
they
went
over
to
do
some
of
assistance.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
but
we
--
there
was
un-contradicted
--
testimony
from
the
officer.
the
defendant
never
took
the
stand
as
he
could've
and
said
“i
felt
restrained.
i
felt
detained.
i
knew
i
couldn't
go.”
he
never
said
any
of
that.
he
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well,
he's
free
to
take
the
stand
to
the
suppression
hearing
without
incriminating
himself
on
way
that
can
be
used
against
him
later
on
the
trial.
he's
free
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story
in
support
of
his
motion
to
suppress
and
he
didn't
do
it.
now,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
evidence
before
the
court
and
the
evidence
in
the
transcript
here
is
un-contradicted.
and
if
you
look
at
it
step
by
step,
it's
reasonable.
now
respondent
talks
about
dragnet
procedures,
this
case
isn't
about
dragnet
procedures.
if
you
look
at
what
the
police
did
step
by
step,
we
submit
their
conduct
was
reasonable.
we
don't
have
to
get
to
that
question,
but
we
submit
that
their
conduct
was
reasonable,
because
it's
a
--
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
adams
versus
williams.
mr.
paul
l.
friedman
well
i
think
it
certainly
does,
because
there
was
some
articulable
reason
at
some
point
to
ask
them
some
questions.
and
after
that
there
was
some
articulable
reason
to
try
to
find
out
who
they
work
further.
just
to
detain
them
--
to
determine
their
identity.
that's
all
that
this
case
is
about.
now
justice
white
asked
a
question
a
little
while
ago
about
are
there
any
cases
where
the
courts
have
said
you
can
ask
passengers
in
a
car
for
identification.
one
case
that
i
know
of
is
a
case
called
united
states
versus
madenville,
445
f.2d,
822,
a
ninth
circuit
case.
but
the
--
and
that
makes
a
point
it's
okay
to
ask
identity
of
people
in
the
car
as
well.
let
me
just
make
two
other
points.
respondent
argues
concerning
live
witness
and
says
that
the
smith
and
bowden
case
written
by
the
chief
justice,
talked
about
all
the
intervening
things
and
so
on.
we
think
that
the
chief
justice's
concurring
opinion
in
roger-brown
makes
clear
that
what
was
being
discussed
there
was
you
don't
suppress
live
witnesses.
cross-examination
is
sufficient
to
protect
people's
rights.
it
goes
to
weight
in
that
admissibility,
whether
depending
upon
how
they
were
seized,
how
they
were
come
in.
we
also
think
that
this
case
is
different
from
the
case
if
they
had
gone
into
a
trunk
and
found
witnesses
in
a
trunk.
these
witnesses
were
not
come
at
by
any
search
or
any
illegality.
they
were
there
in
plain
view,
and
they
were
not
the
result
of
any
sort
of
a
search.
and
even
looking
at
respondent's
argument
at
its
most
favorable
light,
he
says
that
if
he
had
been
permitted
to
drive
on
after
showing
his
license,
the
police
would've
obtained
no
evidence
against
him.
and
that
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about.
if
he
had
been
permitted
to
drive
on,
we
say
everything
else
would've
been
just
the
same
as
it
is
here.
the
passengers
would've
been
detained.
the
evidence
flowed
from
them,
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
detention.
and
we
think
if
you
get
to
stage
two
that
that
may
be
relevant.
