justice

r.

aren't
you
assuming
something
though
that
the
officers
had
the
right
to
hold
the
respondent
after
he
had
identified
himself?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
showed
that
he
had
his
proper
papers.
let's
assume
that
he
had
been
alone
in
the
car,
and
they
came
and
asked
him
to
identify
himself.
they
would
let
him
go
right
away?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
so
that
assumed
--
you
were
assuming
that
when
you
stop
--
if
the
officer
was
entitled
to
go
over
and
ask
somebody
driver
a
car
to
identify
himself
and
show
his
license,
you're
assuming
that
they
also
have
the
right
to
have
the
passengers
identify
themselves?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
let's
assume
that
it
is
not.
assume
that
it
was
not
proper
to
do
that
then
you
have
held
the
driver
of
the
car
beyond
the
time
when
you
find
--
beyond
the
time
that
yet
you
should
be
able
to
hold
them,
in
which
event
arguably
you
have
a
fruit
of
an
illegality
with
respect
to
him
if
you
go
ahead
to
interrogate
the
passengers.
justice
byron
r.
white
you've
already
said
you
wouldn't
let
them
go.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
though.
no
let's
--
let's
just
assume,
i'm
not
saying
this
is
so.
assume
you
have
no
business
with
the
passengers
and
at
what
you
do
with
them
to
the
passengers
is
illegal.
let's
just
assume
that.
and
that
you
have
no
business
holding
the
driver
in
order
to
interrogate
or
to
get
the
passengers
out
of
his
car.
now
just
assume
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
posted
that
he'd
be
able
to
drive
away
as
soon
as
he
identifies
himself,
and
you
said
“no,
just
hold
on
a
minute.
we're
going
to
do
something
else
here.”
with
your
--
with
something
in
your
car,
maybe
bodies,
but
we're
going
to
get
something
out
of
your
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
get
this
question
if
you
had
some
right
and
if
you
had
some
proper
business
with
the
passengers.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
you
may
hold
the
driver
while
you
complete
your
business
with
the
passengers.
now
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
now
you're
doing
on
an
automobile
and
you're
holding
one
person
while
you
complete
your
business
with
another.
now
give
me
some
authority
for
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
seems
to
me
a
rather
fundamental
point
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it
seems
--
assuming
that
if
you're
dealing
with
the
passengers
as
illegal,
it
seems
to
me
whatever
developed
from
the
passengers
is
arguably
at
least
a
fruit
of
detaining
the
driver.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you
something
else.
suppose
that
after
you
--
when
you
got
the
passengers
out
of
the
car,
you
saw
a
briefcase
in
the
back
of
the
car.
and
then
you
reached
--
and
the
officers
reached
in
and
got
the
briefcase
and
it
belonged
to
one
of
the
passenger.
and
they
opened
it
right
then
and
there,
and
it
incriminated
the
driver.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
would
think
he
would
because
he
is
--
because
they
have
invaded
his
car
and
in
effect
seized
something
out
of
his
car
which
is
a
protected
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
assume
that
--
let's
assume
police
break
into
a
man's
house
illegally
without
a
warrant
but
knowing
that
a
henchman
of
his
is
there,
and
they
arrest
the
henchman.
they
take
him
out
of
the
house.
they've
entered
the
house
illegally
and
take
him
down
to
the
station.
he
incriminates
the
owner
of
the
house.
now
can
you
use
his
statements?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
say
that
they
can
use
it,
because
they
seized
these
passengers
out
of
this
man's
car
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
nobody
suggested
that
you've
got
probable
cause
to
have
arrested
those
people
or
to
take
them
on
the
spot
at
all.
