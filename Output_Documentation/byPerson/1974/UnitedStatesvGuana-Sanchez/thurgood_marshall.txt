it's
been
kind
of
a
long
period
of
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
was
17
minutes.
he
called
his
superior
officer
and
this
was
only
17
minutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
17
minutes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
got
more
than
one
building
in
the
town.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
radio
log
is
the
respondent's
--
who
kept
the
radio
log?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
still
in
my
own.
i'm
confused
about
the
right
to
question
these
people.
the
man
in
the
front
seat
showed
identification
for
mexico.
and
yet
that
was
satisfactory.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
he's
certainly
loose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
when
they
checked
it,
they
put
all
three
names
in
or
two?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
he
was
in
custody,
wasn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
he
said
he
wasn't
free
to
drive
off
with
the
passengers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
want
to
be
precisious,
but
he
wasn't
traveling.
they
were
parked.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
his
travel
wasn't
interrupted
by
the
police?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
agree
that
the
respondent
from
the
time
he
was
first
stopped
until
the
time
they
got
into
the
police
station
and
felt
that
he
was
sort
of
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
for
example,
he
said
“will
you
come
along
with
us.”
he
said
“yes.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
know
what
you
do
if
2:30
in
the
morning
when
a
policeman
armed
says
“would
you
mind
coming
along?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
after
that
i
mean.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
two
men
in
the
back
seat,
were
they
under
arrest
at
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
really
don't
know
what
the
arrest
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
know
when
either
one
of
them
was
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
you
take
two
men
and
put
them
in
a
car
with
the
policeman
and
take
them
to
the
police
station.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
take
another
mind
and
said
“would
you
mind
coming
along?”
and
he
says
“yes.”
aren't
all
of
them
the
same
position
to
being
detained?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
one
difference.
the
last
one,
he
said
“come
along.”
if
he
turns
and
run,
he
gets
shot.
he
finds
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know.
but
i
mean
letting
it
feel
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
the
policeman
says
“would
you
mind
coming
along?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
indeed
it
wouldn't
be
any
different.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
to
be
wouldn't
be
any
different.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
well
we
don't
know
how
it
was
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
said,
because
we
don't
have
the
--
we
weren't
there.
