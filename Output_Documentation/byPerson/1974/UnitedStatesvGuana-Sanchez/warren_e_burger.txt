chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
73-820,
united
states
against
guana-sanchez.
mr.
friedman
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
respondent
was
the
driver?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
have
the
facts
here
now.
only
the
two
passengers
from
the
rear
seat
of
the
car
who
did
not
have
identification
were
asked
to
--
were
taken
in
the
police
car
to
the
station?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
man
who
had
--
the
passenger
who
had
identification
and
the
driver
followed
in
their
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
a
police
officer
placed
in
their
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
illustrated
clearly
in
this
case,
because
when
they
got
to
the
police
station,
they
found
a
revolver
in
the
glove
compartment
of
the
car
presumable
belonging
to
the
driver.
but
the
government
never
sought
to
use
that
as
evidence
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
would
be
reasonably
assumed
can
it
that
someone
concluded
that
that
pistol
fit
precisely
under
what
mr.
justice
white
has
just
postulated
namely,
they
had
come
into
the
possession
of
that
pistol
by
invading
the
privacy
of
the
driver's
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
this
is
the
respondent's
evidence,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
that
the
respondent
put
it
in
evidence.
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
said
that
the
outset
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
a
narrow
one,
namely,
the
standing
of
the
driver
to
claim
the
benefit
of
some
violation
for
the
passenger's
rights.
you
haven't
spent
much
time
with
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
beeler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
passengers
who
could
not
speak
english
against
the
background
of,
so
the
record
indicates,
a
number
of
employers
in
that
community
hiring
illegal
mexican
aliens.
and
so
that's
another
element
to
be
taken
into
account,
isn't
it?
we
aren't
concerned
in
this
case
with
what
they
have
been
doing
in
some
other
cases
with
english
speaking
passengers
who
are
changing
tires.
we're
concerned
with
spanish
speaking
passengers
2:30
in
the
morning,
aren't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
what
you're
complaining
about
here,
what
your
client's
complaining
about
is
that
the
two
passengers
in
the
backseat
of
the
car
testified
in
sanchez
trial
that
he
had
smuggled
them
across
the
border
and
into
the
united
states,
isn't
that
what
you're
complaining
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you're
complaining
about
is,
or
the
government
is
resisting
is
the
fact
that
these
witnesses
were
not
permitted
to
testify
that
he
had
smuggled
them
in.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
suggest
that
this
court
is
now
bound
by
what
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
agree
then
that
the
basic
issue
here
is
standing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
any
--
do
you
cite
us
any
case
in
which
the
testimony
of
witnesses
such
as
these
two
passengers
in
the
car
has
been
excluded
or
suppressed
because
of
a
violation
of
the
rights,
constitutional
rights
of
some
other
person?
that
is,
in
this
case,
the
driver.
is
there
any
parallel
case
that
you
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
happened
to
the
tucker
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
--
do
you
make
any
argument
that
the
testimony
of
these
two
aliens
in
the
backseat
would
be
unreliable
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
do
you
think
it
sheds
any
light
on
the
situation
that
the
police
told
the
two
identified
passengers
to
leave
the
car
and
come
with
them
to
the
police
station.
they
distinguished
between
the
two
who
could
not
supply
an
identification,
and
the
two
who
did
have
identification.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
physically.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
show
at
what
stage
the
pistol
was
discovered
in
the
glove
compartment.
that
is
it
is
obviously
after
they
got
to
the
police
station.
but
at
what
point
was
the
search
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
was
that
--
i
don't
recall
that
this
record
shows,
except
that
what
happened
to
it,
except
there's
a
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
isn't
in
this
case.
but
was
there
a
motion
to
suppress
that
independently
in
another
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
friedman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
first
if
we
agree
with
mr.
beeler
that's
the
end
of
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
we
agree
with
you,
it's
got
to
go
back,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
clarify
some?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
case
was
it
in
this
court
that
held
that
the
stop
and
frisk,
and
the
patting
down,
the
searching
could
be
done
without
constituting
an
arrest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
doesn't
that
resolve
some
of
the
questions
that
were
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
friedman.
thank
you
mr.
beeler.
mr.
beeler,
you
came
here
at
the
request
of
the
court
and
by
the
court's
appointment
to
represent
mr.
sanchez.
in
behalf
of
the
court,
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
assistance
to
us
and
of
course
to
mr.
sanchez.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
73-820,
united
states
against
guana-sanchez
in
which
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
mr.
justice
douglas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision.
