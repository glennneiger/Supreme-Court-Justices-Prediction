mr.
david
r.
richards
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involved
on
remand
the
challenged
nine
multimember
districts
existing
in
the
state.
as
it
now
stands,
seven
of
those
districts
were
invalidated
under
the
principles
of
regester
and
are
here
before
the
court.
i,
mr.
gladden,
with
whom
i
am
sharing
time
is
going
to
discuss
tarrant
county
district,
i
am
going
to
attempt
to
discuss
the
ballots.
from
1900
to
1966,
no
negro
citizen
of
texas
was
a
nominee
of
either
the
republican
or
democratic
party
for
any
public
office
in
texas,
any
elective
office.
it
was
not
until
1966
that
a
negro
for
the
first
time
was
elected
to
the
texas
legislature.
one
of
those
is
now
serving
in
congress,
and
that's
congresswoman
barbara
gordon.
when
i
came
up
yesterday
on
the
airplane,
i
picked
up
the
current
atlantic
monthly
to
go
outside
the
records
for
a
moment,
which
devoted
this
month
to
texas
and
there
is
an
article
by
ms.
jordan
in
it,
and
she
says
what
i
think
is
quite
accurate.
until
this
court
decided
to
get
into
apportionment,
there
was
no
chance
in
texas
or
in
the
south
for
blacks
to
be
elected
to
office.
it
was
only
when
harris
county
as
a
consequence
of
this
court's
decision
requiring
one-man-one-vote
in
both
houses
of
legislature,
required
re-districting
in
harris
county
that
she
had
an
opportunity
to
be
elected
to
office,
and
frankly
that
situation
remained
unchanged
until
this
court
decided
regester
last
term.
with
the
advent
of
regester,
and
the
effect
of
single-member
districts
in
dallas,
bexar,
and
harris
county
now
there
has
been
a
dramatic
increase
in
both
black
and
mexican-american
representation
in
the
texas
legislature
and
as
we
see
it,
it
solely
is
attributable
to
this
court's
involvement
in
reapportionment
litigation,
and
we
would
hate
at
this
point
to
see
a
retreat
very
frankly.
the
contrast
with
whitcomb
is
just
that
i
think
which
justice
white
alluded
to.
in
whitcomb
the
court
characterized
a
typical
legislative
race
as
a
head-to-head
race
between
two
opposing
parties.
in
marion
county,
indiana
if
the
democrats
won,
typically
the
ghetto
would
have
adequate
representation
if
i
recall
the
language,
that
simply
not
the
case
in
texas.
texas
is
a
one
party
state
which
we
have
majority
place
system,
all
races
are
determined
in
the
primary,
and
what
it
results
in
is
a
head-to-head
race
with
the
minority
candidate
pitted
against
an
anglo
candidate
and
the
result
has
been
almost
without
exception,
defeat
to
the
minority
candidate.
this
texas
is
peculiar
in
several
regards
and
this
is
a
special
system,
but
the
result
has
been
clear,
as
the
virtual
exclusion
for
minority
elections.
we
have
today
what
we
think
to
be
just
simply
the
sequel
to
the
bexar
and
dallas
cases.
in
some
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
in
some
of
the
counties,
the
evidence
is
stronger
than
it
was
with
respect
to
bexar
or
even
in
dallas,
that
is
with
respect
to
some
of
the
counties
before
the
court.
the
record
is
at
this
point
something
like
14
print
volumes.
the
original
seven
volumes
of
the
regester
case
together
with
i
think,
additional
six
printed
volumes
today.
for
example,
we
would
suggest
that
the
plight
of
the
blacks
in
most
of
these
counties
is
significantly
worse
than
it
was
for
the
blacks
in
dallas
county,
because
at
least
in
dallas,
there
was
sort
of
a
white
man's
burden
assumed
that
they
would
occasionally
slate
a
black,
put
him
on
the
ticket,
have
him
elected.
in
jefferson
county
for
example,
that's
never
been
the
case,
and
it
looks
to
me
as
if
it
never
will
be
the
case.
there
the
testimony
is
that
politics
in
that
county
been
dominated
by
“the
arm
of
texas
afl
cio”
and
that
slating
by
cope
was
tantamount
to
election.
the
testimony
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
how
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
three
i
am
sorry.
jefferson
county
at
this
stage
is
carved
really
into
one
three-member
multimember
district,
a
portion
of
the
county
is
tacked
on
another
single-member
district
and
a
portion
of
the
county
is
tacked
on
to
yet
another
single-member
district.
we
are
concerned
of
course
only
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
beaumont
and
port
arthur
or
the
towns,
both
beaumont
and
port
arthur
are
within
the
multimember
district.
the
record
shows
that
when
blacks
went
to
cope
leadership
and
said
why
can't
you
slate
us,
why
can't
you
make
us
one
of
the
recommended
candidates,
the
leadership's
response
was
we
are
afraid
of
rank
and
file
pressures,
hostility
toward
blacks
if
we
put
you
on
the
ticket
and
endorse
you,
we
might
not
be
reelected
to
our
offices.
that's
pretty
strong
stuff,
and
that's
exactly
the
situation
that
prevails
today.
in
mclennan
county,
where
i
grew
up,
the
state's
witness
testified,
not
our
witness,
the
state's
witness
testified
that
is
still
the
people
of
mclennan
county
weren't
prepared
to
vote
for
a
negro
candidate.
they
were
still
light
years
away
from
that
sophistication.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
is
in
central
texas
on
the
brazos
river.
mr.
david
r.
richards
waco
is
the
county
seat
and
occupied
essentially
the
entire
legislative
district.
in
bexar
county,
and
we
heard,
you
heard
bexar
county
before
there
was
evidence
of
reasonable
access
to
--
reasonable
success
in
some
instance
of
mexican-american
candidates.
the
success
of
mexican-americans
candidates
in
the
counties
that
we
are
looking
at
today
el
paso,
nueces,
and
lubbock
is
dramatically
less
than
it
was
in
bexar
county.
and
unlike
bexar
county,
where
there
was
no
suggestion
of
racial
campaign
tactics
ever
being
utilized,
there
is
evidence
that
they
regularly
utilized
and
these
are
counties
to
defeat
mexican-american
candidates.
granted
there
maybe
a
first
amendment
right
to
utilize
racial
campaign
tactics,
but
our
concern
is
how
does
a
multimember
district
operate
on
minority
access
and
it's
our
view
that
this
is
a
relevant
consideration
that
this
four,
in
fact
four
ordains
lack
of
success
by
the
minority
candidate.
although,
we're
dealing
with
six
counties,
and
they
are
each
different
and
each
i
suppose
had
a
particularized
appraisal
by
the
trial
court,
there
are
some
similarities.
at
the
time
of
trial,
no
black
had
ever
been
a
nominee
of
the
democratic
primary
for
any
office
in
any
of
those
counties.
the
one
pattern
that
emerged
in
at
least
three
of
the
places
we
looked
at
was
a
re-occurrence
of
a
certain
theme
that
is
when
minority
candidates
threaten
success
at
the
polls,
the
game
was
changed.
in
waco,
the
first
time
a
black
candidate
ran
for
city
counsel,
at
that
point
waco
had
a
ward
system,
that's
actually
a
single-member
district
system.
a
black
candidate
ran
the
next
time
around
they
changed
the
rules,
went
back
to
an
at
large
election
voted
on
by
the
entire
electorate.
in
travis
county
also,
the
same
pattern
emerged.
the
first
city
counsel
candidate
black,
also
the
[inaudible]
ran
to
the
city
council
and
ran
a
good
race.
what
they
do?
change
the
rules,
went
from
a
plurality
to
a
majority
system
the
next
time
around.
nueces
county.
first
time,
the
mexican-american
candidates
there
seriously
threatened
the
school
board
elections.
they
moved
from
a
plurality
to
a
majority
system
and
what
we
are
really
saying
i
think
in
parts
that
this
at
large
majority
place
system,
links
up
in
a
very
real
way
to
deny
access
to
minority
candidates.
i
think
that's
precisely
what
the
court
found
the
first
time;
that's
what
this
court
found
when
it
affirmed
unanimously
regester
and
we
think
it's
the
same
case
again.
to
the
extent,
at
one
stage,
the
dissent
suggests
that
part
of
our
burden
is
to
prove
that
these
districts
were
designed
to
disenfranchise
minority
candidates.
i
take
it
that
means
that
we
must
show
an
unlawful
motive.
we
do
not
think
that's
the
proper
equal
protection
test,
but
to
the
extent
that,
that's
the
test
or
to
the
extent
that,
that's
our
burden;
the
evidence
is
here
just
as
it
was
before,
that
is,
it's
the
same
record,
it's
the
same
people
acting,
it's
the
same
action
of
the
legislative
redistricting
board
that
created
the
districts
that
are
now
before
the
court,
that
were
here
before.
it
seems
to
me
at
least
that
one
thing
comes
through
quite
clearly,
the
texas
supreme
court
said
in
mauzy
versus
redistricting
board
that
the
legislative
redistricting
board
in
structuring
these
districts
should
consider
carefully
whether
any
multimember
district
might
result
in
discrimination
against
minority
candidates
and
yet
the
testimony
is
quite
clear
that
the
legislative
redistricting
board
totally
ignored
this
question
and
indeed,
one
member
of
the
board
characterized
the
appearance
and
testimony
of
the
minority
candidates
with
an
effort
there,
the
profane
effort
there
and
characterized
it
as
being
ignored
entirely.
so
i
suppose
one
can
assume
that
they
intended
the
logical
consequences
of
their
act.
they
did
not
undertake
to
consider
the
impact
upon
minorities
and
in
so
doing,
it
seems
to
us,
supplied
the
necessary
motive
if
in
fact,
it
was
a
requirement.
i
have
one
or
two
sides
about
how
deeply
embedded
the
state
policy
is
with
respect
to
multi-membered
districts.
there
is
one
oddity
in
this
case
to
me,
that
is
with
respect
to
mclennan
county,
one
of
the
smallest
ones
involved.
when
the
legislature
redistricted
mclennan
county
in
1971,
it
created
two
single-member
districts
in
mclennan
county.
when
the
legislative
redistricting
board
came
about
this
task,
they
reconstituted
that
county
into
a
multi-membered
district.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
had
been
a
multimember
district
before
1970.
well
at
least
in
terms
of
when
its
population
justified
it
and
it
had
been
a
multimember
district
for
some
time.
mr.
david
r.
richards
with
two
at
one
point,
yes.
years
ago,
that
was
larger
and
had
four
representatives
to
its
--
but
anyway,
when
the
legislature
came
to
deal
with
it
in
1970
after
the
census,
for
the
first
time,
the
legislature
cut
it
into
two
single-member
districts,
and
then
it
was
the
legislative
redistricting
board
after
they
were
impelled
at
that
they
reconstituted
the
multimember
district.
and
this
is
what
the
same
see-saw
comes
to
because
the
legislature
did
not
create
single-member
districts
in
harris
county,
it
created
three
districts
in
which
representatives
ran
i
think
6
in
one,
7
in
another,
and
it
was
the
legislative
redistricting
board
that
constituted
single-member
districts
there.
so
from
the
top
and
the
bottom
of
the
spectrum,
you
have
sort
of
wavering
policies
review
it.
finally,
it
seems
to
us
that
one
question
that
is
in
the
case
that
i
want
to
speak
a
moment
to
and
that's
the
matter
of
remedy.
the
state
argues
and
i
guess
by
virtue
of
the
state
that
was
granted
here;
there
must
be
maybe
some
concern
because
the
court
implemented
its
own
plans
or
the
plaintiff's
plans
for
the
single-member
districts.
we
think
of
the
circumstances,
it
was
entirely
proper.
as
the
record
reflects,
the
trial
court
ordered
the
state,
didn't
order
the
state,
requested
the
state
to
produce
any
proposed
redistricting
plans
that
it
had
by
january
18,
1974.
the
state
produced
no
plans
by
that
date.
the
court
then
scheduled
a
hearing
for
january
28,
at
which
time
the
question
of
what
remedy
was
going
to
be
applied.
at
that
point,
the
state
did
appear
and
adopt
certain
plans,
but
with
respect
to
the
six
counties
that
we
are
concerned
with,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
with
respect
to
mclennan
county
and
travis
county,
and
el
paso
county,
the
state
offered
no
plan
in
opposition
to
plan
offered
by
the
plaintiffs,
in
effect
acquiesced
in
it.
in
nueces
county,
the
state
affect,
adopted
two
plans,
said
either
one
was
satisfactory;
one
of
those
plans
being
the
plan
proffered
by
the
plaintiffs.
only
in
lubbock
and
jefferson
county
that
the
state
offered
plans
in
opposition
to
those
proposed
by
the
plaintiffs.
and
in
both
instances
the
state
plan
was
less
faithful
to
the
state
policy
than
the
plaintiff's
plans
because
in
each
instance,
the
state
plan
would
have
required
redrawing
adjoining
single-member
districts.
thus,
in
jefferson
county,
they
would
have
restructured
not
only
the
multimember
district,
but
altered
single-member
districts
that
were
abutting
it
on
either
side,
which
were
not
even
in
issue.
the
same
pattern
emerged
in
lubbock
county
where
they
sponsored
the
plan.
the
state's
plan
would
have
required
not
only
creating
the
single-member
district,
but
alteration
of
adjoining
single-member
district.
so
we
would
suggest
to
court,
the
trial
court
in
adopting
our
proposals
was
more
faithful
to
this
court's
decision
in
weiser
versus
white,
that
is
because
the
plans
we
sponsored
were
faithful
to
the
state
policy,
did
not
in
fact
intrude
upon
the
adjoining
districts
and
for
that
reason
clearly
no
abuse
of
discretion.
further,
the
plan
sponsored
by
the
state
in
jefferson
county,
assuming
that
the
concern
of
the
case
was
to
enfranchise
or
disenfranchise
negro
minority
of
that
city
or
that
district,
the
state's
plan
would
have
drawn
the
negro
population
of
jefferson
county
into
four
nice
slices,
20%
each
of
the
four
districts
which
would
have
it
seems
to
me
would
have
worsened
the
situation
where
now
they
constitute
30%
of
the
multimember
district
under
the
state's
proposal
they
have
been
reduced
down
to
roughly
20
to
25%
in
each
of
the
four
proposed
single-member
districts.
we
do
not
--
it's
our
view
if
the
record
as
i
say
is
exactly
the
record
that
we
presented
to
this
court
in
the
first
round.
all
of
the
same
evidence
is
here,
we
have
gone
back
and
done
exactly
what
we
did
the
first
time
around,
developed
evidence
on
a
local
basis
of
how
the
multimember
district
operated
in
fact
in
those
counties
upon
the
minority
of
those
counties.
and
two
counties
where
the
proof
simply
didn't
sustain
itself
one
in
hidalgo,
we
all
conceded
that
their
multimember
district
there
could
not
be
demonstrated
to
deprive
the
minority
of
that
county
of
access.
the
same
was
true
in
galveston
county
where
again
a
particularized
local
appraisal
led
everyone
to
the
conclusion
that
the
multimember
district
there
did
not
in
fact
--
did
not
access.
in
galveston
county,
the
trial
court
--
i
am
sorry.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
can
tell
you
some
of
it.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
r.
richards
first
let
me
point
--
i
mean,
at
least
point
out
first,
the
fact
that
there
was
perhaps
a
numerical
majority
was
also
the
argument
made
by
the
state
with
respect
to
bexar
county
in
the
initial
case.
the
fact
is
however
that
in
el
paso
county
whereas
there
was
a
numerical
majority,
there
was
38%
of
the
registered
voters
were
mexican-american
and
participation
figures
were
even
lower
than
that,
and
i
think
what
the
court
was
saying
in
el
paso
county
was
the
same
thing
the
court
said
with
respect
to
bexar
county.
by
taking
together
with
historical
factors
including
the
poll
tax
and
all
the
things
that
have
served
to
diminish
mexican-american
participation
in
texas
operated
very
frankly
in
el
paso
county
with
a
great
deal
more
force
than
it
did
on
bexar
county.
i
don't
like
to
get
into
numbers
but
the
numbers
frankly
are
that
in
as
my
good
friend
george
korbel
said
it
was
five,
four
and
since
re-construction
there
at
least
that
five
mexican
americans
elected
to
the
legislature
from
bexar
county
and
el
paso
only
4,
and
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried,
not
a
single-member
of
the
el
paso
delegation
legislature
was
mexican-american
and
i
think
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
would
not
argue
as
to
the
current
delegation
of
the
legislature.
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
evidence
that
supported
that
particular
finding.
there
certainly
was
evidence
and
a
finding
that
historically
there
had
been
unresponsiveness.
in
fact
one
of
the
persons
who
testified
was
a
former
senator
there
who
testified
that
he
opposed
abolition
of
a
poll
tax
which
the
trial
court,
i
think,
quite
properly
found
to
be
evidence
of
one
responsiveness
in
light
of
the
history
of
the
poll
tax
as
it
fell
upon
mexican-americans
and
blacks
in
texas.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
excuse
me,
i
think
it
should
pay
attention
and
i
think
it
did
pay
attention,
and
i
am
saying
to
you
that
in
the
el
paso
county
for
example,
the
time
this
case
was
tried,
no
mexican-americans
were
elected
among
the
four-member
delegation
or
five-member
delegation,
actually
from
el
paso
county
served
the
texas
legislature,
and
that
was
part
of
the
facts
of
that
case.
in
nueces
county,
when
facts
of
that
case
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
yeah,
that
is
true,
i'm
sorry,
that
is
the
fact,
at
the
time
of
the
court's
opinion.
there
only
as
i
say
four
in
history,
in
a
county
that
constitutes
a
numerical
majority
and
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
this
is
purely
a
numbers
game,
the
testimony
in
el
paso
county
is
from
the
former
democratic
county
chairman
that
they
were
sufficient.
mr.
david
r.
richards
alright.
i
don't
know
they
have
changed
dramatically
--
the
facts
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
suppose
the
facts
could
change
to
moot
the
case,
the
facts
could
change
so
dramatically
that
it
might
require
a
reconsideration.
i
would
suggest
that
there
has
been
no
such
dramatic
change
in
texas.
there
is
now
representative
paul
moreno
has
been
elected
from
el
paso,
so
there
now
sits
one
mexican-american
in
el
paso
delegation.
and
bobby
webber
(ph)
lost
again
in
fort
worth,
al
price
lost
again
in
jefferson
county.
i
mean,
we
can
go
either
way.
the
black
candidates
that
we
were
proving
about,
and
they
said,
well,
they
just
try
again,
it
will
be
better,
they
tried
it
again
and
they
lost.
so,
i
mean,
it
really
cuts
both
ways.
we
suggest
that
there
has
not
been
a
significant
change
in
the
picture
in
texas
with
the
possible
exception
of
travis
county,
which
is
a
very
specialized
breed
of
cat
and
there
--
as
mrs.
levatino
points
out,
there
has
been
a
change
there
more
attributable
i
think
to
18-year-old
vote
than
to
any
diminishing
of
prejudice
on
part
of
the
electorate.
thank
you.
