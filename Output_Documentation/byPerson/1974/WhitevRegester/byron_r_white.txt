justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
what
was
the
issue
when
this
case
was
remanded
here?
was
the
only
issue
in
this
last
phase
of
the
case
the
multimember
districts?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
existed
only
in
certain
areas?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
relief
was
given
in
each
--
if
all
of
the
multimember
districts
were
made
single-member
districts,
nothing
would
happen
to
all
the
other
districts
in
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
was
this
multimember
district
issue,
since
it
affected
only
certain
localities
in
the
state?
why
was
it
a
three-judge
court
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
only
concerned
maybe
one
of
the
multimember
districts
out
of
several
it
might
be
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
all
of
them
--
all
of
the
multimember
districts
without
exception
were
under
attack
on
this
remand?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
as
before
you
leave
this
one
factor,
suppose
there's
a
ten-man
multimember
district,
ten
representative
multimember
district,
and
each
election,
one
party
slates
three
out
of
the
ten
as
--
slates
three
negroes
our
of
the
ten,
which
is
roughly
proportional
to
the
population,
i
assume,
and
there
is
an
opposing
slate
from
another
party.
and
each
time
all
but
three,
all
but
the
three
negroes
are
elected,
and
when
the
party
slates
all
ten
anglo,
they
all
ten
win,
this
party
is
clearly
in
a
majority,
let's
assume,
that
slates
the
three.
the
only
is
there
is
three
three
negroes
who
lose
all
the
time,
in
this
multimember
district,
they
just
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
we
didn't
have
any
--
in
whitcomb,
you
suggest
whitcomb,
but
whitcomb
never
had
anything
like
that.
there
in
indianapolis,
the
minority
won
if
the
party
won?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
the
example
i
just
gave
you,
the
minority
didn't
win
even
if
the
party
wins.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
did
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
arguably
that
is
the
situation
in
some
of
these,
at
least
it's
argued
to
be
the
situation
in
some
of
these?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
difference
whether
[inaudible]
consistent
voting
[inaudible]
against
any
kind
of
minority
and
that's
the
reason
to
disestablish
a
multimember
district,
that's
the
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn't
the
district
court
pay
attention
to
the
actual
current
situation
when
it
makes
its
judgment,
if
at
the
time
it
decides
there
are
representatives
of
the
minority
being
slated
in
and
elected
in
a
district,
should
the
district
court
nevertheless
say
that
historically
this
hasn't
been
so
and
therefore
we're
going
to
disestablish
the
multimember
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
court's
opinion,
is
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
between
decision
and
appeal
the
facts
of
situation
changes
dramatically?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
they
did,
what
would
you
suggest
that
appellate
court
should
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
elections
there,
are
they
by
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
one
party
is
the
one
party
operation,
but
it's
just
that,
that
had
races.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
difficult
is
it
to
get
on
the
primary
ballot?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
the
signatures
is
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
sign
up
for
a
place
in
the
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
pick
your
opponent.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
going
to
get
picked
unless
you're
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
--
you
must
say
that
there's
complete
access
to
the
ballot?
justice
byron
r.
white
slating
is
beside
the
point
as
far
as
access
to
the
ballots
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
not
be
beside
the
points
as
to
who
wins?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
complete
access
to
the
ballot.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
it
really
is
the
function
of
the
discriminatory
voting
that
has
kept
blacks
off
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
then
this
all
a
negro
has
to
do
is
to
go
ahead
and
pay
$100,
he's
on
the
ballot?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
nevertheless,
whatever
the
results
are,
they
can't
keep
negroes
off
the
ballot?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
they
can
do
is
organize
the
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what's
what
i
mean.
so
the
discrimination
is
a
function
of
the
results
of
the
poll?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
suggesting
that
the
consistent
discrimination
at
the
polls
against
blacks
who
are
running
for
office,
a
systematic
discrimination
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
disestablishing
a
multimember
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wasn't
a
issue
at
all
in
whitcomb?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
in
a
number
of
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
a
black
ever
slated?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
elected?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
guess
the
fellow
from
the
other
slate
won?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
interesting
is
that
both
slating
organizations
slated
the
blacks?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
wouldn't
say
the
same
thing,
if
the
multimember
district
was
just
established
and
the
same
thing
occurred
in
the
single
member
districts.
you
wouldn't
say
that?
you
say
it
couldn't
happen
because
of
the
so
called
minority
--
would
be
a
minority
in
similar
district,
but
it
could
happen.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
state
can
make
it
happen
even
in
single
member
districts,
and
then
you
wouldn't
have
[attempt
to
laughter]
much
different
plan
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
doubt
if
you
could
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
intent
to
dilute
like
somebody
intensely
intense
to
beat
a
negro
at
the
vote
of
the
polls,
you're
not
going
to
upset
that
very
easily?
