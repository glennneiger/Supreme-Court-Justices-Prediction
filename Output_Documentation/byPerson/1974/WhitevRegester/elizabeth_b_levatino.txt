ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
an
order
issued
by
a
three-judge
federal
court
for
the
western
district
of
texas
sitting
in
austin,
which
held
the
multimember
district
scheme
embodied
in
the
texas
plan
for
reapportionment,
unconstitutional.
the
state
of
texas
believes
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
failed
to
produce
evidence
which
meets
their
burden
of
proof
such
as
would
warrant
the
suspension
by
a
federal
court
of
multimember
districts,
a
policy
consistently
utilized
in
the
texas
system
of
appropriation
for
its
state
house
of
representatives.
we
are
not
here
to
debate
or
to
defend
the
merits
of
whether
or
not
single-member
district
should
be
used
or
multimember
district
should
be
used,
but
rather
viewed
from
the
constitutional
perspective,
set
forth
by
this
court,
that
is
a
decision
which
at
this
point
should
be
left
to
the
legislature.
because
the
record
in
this
case
simply
does
not
support
the
proposition
that
multimember
districts
have
resulted
in
a
loss
of
access
or
in
less
opportunity
of
a
minority
group
to
participate
in
the
political
processes
leading
to
nomination
in
election,
and
therefore
does
not
support
the
action
taken
by
the
court
below.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
below
because
that
decision
was
based
on
incorrect
constitutional
standards,
evidence
insufficient
to
support
the
correct
constitutional
standards
as
well
as
the
erroneous
standards
used,
and
the
failure
of
the
court
to
afford
the
texas
legislature,
the
opportunity
to
function
it
--
to
exercise
its
proper
function
of
reapportionment.
the
weakness
of
the
plaintiff's
case
and
the
opinion
of
the
majority
below,
particularly
in
dealing
with
the
evidence
before
the
court
is
strikingly
shown
by
the
well-reasoned
and
exhaustive
dissent
of
judge
wood.
judge
wood,
as
you
may
remember,
only
two
years
before,
clearly
agreed
with
the
other
two
members
of
the
panel
that
adequate
and
sufficient
evidence
was
presented
to
the
court
to
invalidate
the
multimember
districts
for
dallas
and
bexar
counties.
this
court
has
consistently
and
repeatedly
insisted
that
the
challenger
of
multimember
districts
produce
evidence
which
is
sufficient
to
show
that
because
of
the
multimember
district,
members
of
the
minority
group
within
the
district
are
afforded
less
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
political
processes,
leading
to
nomination
in
election,
thereby
minimizing
or
canceling
out
the
voting
strength
of
the
racial
or
political
element
within
that
district.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
basically,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
it
was
the
multimember
districts
throughout
the
scheme.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
they
exist
--
there
were
11
remaining
multimember
districts.
the
plaintiffs
intervened
a
plaintiff's
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
depending
on
how
the
single-member
districts
were
created.
additionally,
the
court
below
did
find
racial
gerrymandering
with
regard
to
galveston,
which
would
require
an
actual
redistricting
not
on
the
basis
of
multimember,
single-member
districts,
but
a
changing
of
the
scheme
in
that
area
which
could
have
a
domino
effect
to
affect
the
entire
reapportionment
scheme.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
your
honor,
i
believe
that
one
of
the
major
reasons
that
it
is
a
three-judge
court
issue
is
that
this
case
attacks
all
of
the
remaining
districts
which
is
a
statewide
policy,
and
as
this
court
has
so
recently
held
in
chapman
versus
meier,
subject
matter
of
this
kind
is
regular
grist
for
the
three-judge
court,
and
that
route
typically
has
been
employed
under
conditions
similar
to
those
present
here.
and,
of
course,
this
court
took
jurisdiction
in
that
case.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
it
maybe
different,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
posture
of
this
case
is
attacking
just
one
or
just
another.
it
really
is
attacking
the
policy
decision
of
the
texas
legislature
to
utilize
multimember
districts
et
all.
these
district
range
from
two
multi
--
two
members
up
to
8
--
up
to
9
members;
it's
the
whole
policy.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
yes
they
were,
your
honor.
i
believe
it
--
i
do
not
want
to
mislead
the
court
at
trial
plaintiffs
conceded
that
they
could
not
find
evidence
of
discrimination
in
one
of
the
two-member
district
which
was
hidalgo
county
and
they
changed
the
challenge
in
galveston
county
from
a
challenge
to
the
multimember
district
to
the
racial
gerrymandering
challenge.
although,
the
pleadings
initially
challenged
all
of
the
multimember
districts
that
remained
in
the
county.
it
is
the
lack
of
access
or
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
political
processes
which
must
be
shown,
yet
the
majority
below
saw
fit
to
devise
another
new
kind
of
test.
this
test
can't
be
supported
by
the
opinions
of
this
court
nor
by
basic
logic,
neither
can
it
be
used
to
bootstrap
a
record
which
would
otherwise
be
insufficient
to
sustain
holdings
of
unconstitutionality.
this
new
test
consists
of
an
aggregate
of
four
factors.
these
factors
are
restricted
access
of
the
minority
to
the
slating
process
of
particular
party
nominations,
the
consistent
use
of
racist
campaign
tactics
to
defeat
minority
candidates
or
those
champion
minority
concerns,
the
indifference
or
hostility
of
the
district-wide
representatives
to
particularize
needs
of
the
minority
and
the
inability
of
minority
groups
to
obtain
representation
in
proportion
to
their
percentage
of
the
population
in
the
district.
as
set
out
in
our
brief
we
believe
these
factors
operate
primarily
in
a
“get
one
win
three”
manner,
therefore,
always
adding
up
to
an
aggregate,
but
beyond
that
i'd
like
to
consider
each
factor
individually,
beginning
with
this--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
in
a
“get
one
win
three”
manner.
by
that
i
mean,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
three
factors
if
you
could
find
that
there
was
no
access
to
the
slating
process--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
you
automatically
get
the
other
two,
so
it
adds
up
to
three
and
thereby
you
win
the
game.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
independent,
they
are
functions
of
each
other,
basically.
beginning
with
the
factor
regarding
the
election
of
a
minority
group
in
proportion
to
their
population
of
the
district,
i
believe
this
factor
has
previously
been
rejected
by
this
court
in
whitcomb
and
more
recently
in
chapman
as
evidence
of
non
access.
indeed,
the
record
in
this
case
actually
reflects
that
in
two
of
the
districts,
nueces
and
el
paso,
members
of
the
minority
group
have
been
consistently
elected
in
the
past
decade
to
the
house
of
representatives
as
well
as
to
other
district-wide
governmental
races.
in
the
1968
and
1970
elections,
nueces
sent
a
delegation
to
the
house
which
consisted
of
representative
truan,
a
mexican-american,
representative
hale,
an
honorary
member
of
the
mexican-american
group
and
sissy
farenthold
widely
known
for
her
interest
and
concern
for
the
minority
people.
in
the
latest
election,
a
third
district
travis
elected
two
members
of
two
different
minority
groups
to
two
out
of
four
seats
and
that
delegation
is
now
composed
of
its
dean
sarah
waddington
a
30-year-old
woman,
a
mexican-american,
gonzalo
barrientos,
who
this
time
beat
the
then
17-year
anglo
incumbent,
mrs.
delco,
the
black
woman
who
the
majority
characterized
her
election,
early
election
to
the
school
board
as
a
distortion
in
the
voting
pattern
and
finally
a
32-year-old
male
anglo.
now
no
one
can
guarantee
that
this
pattern
will
continue,
but
then
no
one
can
guarantee
that
it
won't
continue.
at
the
very
least,
it
is,
and
i
believe,
should
be
considered
as
strong
evidence
that
minority
groups
do
have
access
to
the
political
process.
furthermore,
while
the
plaintiffs
in
the
court
below
were
taking
great
pains
to
emphasize
the
relative
failure
of
the
minorities
at
the
ballot
box
since
reconstruction,
the
record
also
was
reflecting
that
minority
groups,
both
leaders
and
individuals,
endorsed
and
voted
for
non
minority
candidates,
thereby
electing
many
of
these
candidates
and
making
them
their
--
legislators
of
their
choice.
proceeding
to
the
next
factor,
the
indifference
or
hostility
of
the
representatives
to
the
particularized
minority
interest,
this
too
has
never
been
referred
to
by
this
court
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
is
relevant
access,
i
mean,
relevant
evidence
of
access.
however,
this
court
has
said
that
election
is
not
paramount
to
their
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
i
submit
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
your
honor,
i
submit
to
you
that
we
don't
really
have
the
situation
that
you're
suggesting
in
this
case
either.
much
has
been
made
that
texas
is
a
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
if
you
did,
i
believe
that
first
of
all,
the
fact
that
the
minority
was
slated
--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
it
is
argued
to
be
the
situation,
yes.
if
you
had
the
situation,
first
of
all
that
the
minority
candidates
were
consistently
slated,
i
believe
that
is
evidence
of
access.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
but
i
believe
you
also
have
to
look
to
why
some
of
these
candidates
were
not
elected.
i
believe
that
as
you
well
know
the
function
of
election
includes
issues,
personalities,
many
things,
other
than
merely
blacks
only
voting
for
blacks
and
whites
only
voting
for
whites.
in
the
county,
i
believe,
you're
referring
to,
mr.
bobby
webber
(ph),
received
48%
of
the
vote
in
that
particular
multimember
district,
the
tarrant
county
district.
now
that
certainly
shows
that
he
got
more
than
just
the
black
votes
in
that
area.
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
close
question,
but
i
do
not
--
i
think
that
the
question
is
that
close
in
these
districts
as
the
hypothetical
which
you
presented.
with
regard
to
the
ability
to
represent
the
minority,
this
also
has
been
rejected
as
significant
or
has
never
been
affirmatively
said
to
be
significant
in
evaluating
the
particular
access
to
the
political
process,
but
the
court,
even
if
it
were
relevant,
the
court
below
didn't
really
apply
this
factor.
they
applied
their
own
factor,
which
required
some
kind
of
legis
--
affirmative
legislative
action
on
behalf
of
all
the
members
of
the
delegations.
the
reason
for
this
change
was
that
the
record
generally
reflected
non
hostile
or
even
sympathetic
voting
records
in
some
districts,
clear
concessions
of
excellent
voting
records
and
certainly,
sympathy
for
the
needs
of
the
minority.
in
one
county,
the
majority
went
even
further
from
its
pronounced
test
by
finding
that
a
delegate
was
deficient
because
he
could
not
empathize
with
the
minority,
even
if
he
could
sympathize
with
it.
this
is
only
one
more
example
of
the
weakness
of
the
plaintiff's
case
and
the
obvious
attempt
by
the
majority
to
provide
that
which
the
plaintiffs
did
not.
the
third
factor,
of
course,
is
the
consistent
use
of
racist
campaign
tactics,
a
policy
or
a
strategy,
which
we
all
deplore.
but
again,
which
this
court
has
never
related
specifically
to
the
issue
of
access.
the
mention
of
it
in
declaring
dallas
county
multimember
district
unconstitutional,
included
the
inference
that
such
tactics
must
be
successful,
an
element
now
discarded
by
the
majority.
additionally,
as
pointed
out
by
judge
wood,
the
few
cited
instance
of
the
use
of
such
tactics,
a
whisper
campaign
in
el
paso
for
a
mayor's
race
or
school
board
races
in
the
50s
and
60s
in
nueces
county,
this
kind
of
evidence
hardly
rises
to
the
level
of
consistent
and
certainly
not
to
the
level
of
proof
required
in
a
case
of
this
nature.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
i
believe
that
they
could
take
it
into
account,
your
honor,
but
i
do
not
believe
it
could
be
one
in
a
factor
--
checklist
of
factors
the
way
these
are
set
up,
that
would
especially
if
they
had
not
been
successful
as
the
record
generally
shows,
that
it
would
rise
to
the
level
of
proof
which
this
court
has
required.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
i
believe,
the
reason
it
could
be
taken
into
account
would
be
to
show
that
black
or
brown,
minority
candidates
could
never
be
elected
or
that
their
election
was
totally
impossible
in
especially
a
large
district.
this
is
not
reflected
in
this
record,
however.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
i
believe
that
everyone
can
say
what
they
want
to
say
in
a
campaign,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
i
believe
you
would
have
the
possibility
of
doing
that,
your
honor.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
taking
into
account
conduct
which
is--
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
your
honor,
i
do
believe
that
the
court
can
take
this
into
account,
but
as
i
said
the
way
this
court
used
a
checklist
factor,
the
use
of
these
candidate
--
and
adding
it
all
up
supposedly
independent
of
each
other,
the
factors
didn't
work
that
way.
and
additionally,
the
racist
campaign
tactics
cited
by
the
court
as
pointed
out
by
judge
wood
were
not,
certainly
not
consistent
and
in
most
of
the
instances,
we're
not
successful.
so
what
--
its
relevance
to
the
access,
in
this
case,
i
believe
is
not
sufficient
to
sustain
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
yes,
sir.
i
do
not
pretend
to
say
that
you
can't
vote
for
any
person
for
any
reason.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
on
its
own
grounds
that
is
enough
of
a
reason.
this
court
has
said
you
have
to
show
denial
of
the
opportunity
to
participate.
the
fact
that
a
racist
campaign
tactic
is
used
does
not
say
that
the
minority
group
in
question
is
not
participating
in
it.
it
maybe
noted,
it
may
go
into
the
totality
of
circumstances,
but
in
and
of
itself,
it
is
not
a
grounds
for
declaring
a
multimember
unconstitutional.
the
final
factor
is
the
restricted
access
of
the
minority
to
the
slating
of
candidates
for
party
nominations.
this,
we
believe,
is
a
valid
factor
and
we
believe
it's
the
only
one
which
this
court
has
heretofore
approved
and
set
out
is
something
that
should
be
shown,
in
fact,
must
be
shown.
however,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
while
texas
much
has
been
made
that
the
fact
that
texas
is
a
one-party
state,
the
primary
elections
and
activity
prior
to
the
primary
election
reflect
just
as
intense
political
battles
between
conservatives,
liberals,
business
labor
as
is
reflected
between
the
major
parties
in
any
other
states
and
i
believe,
you
must
view
the
slating
procedure
in
that
nature.
the
record
reflects
that
in
only
two
counties,
tarrant
and
jefferson
are
there
any
cognizable,
formalized
groups
which
consistently
endorse
candidates.
minorities
have
received
that
endorsement
in
both
counties.
this
is
a
far
cry
from
the
situation
found
by
this
court
to
exist
in
round
one
of
this
particular
case
where
virtually
complete
control
over
the
candidates
and
political
processes
in
dallas
county
was
exercised
by
the
dallas
citizens
of
responsible
government,
the
dcrg.
additionally
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
that
endorsement
of
any
one
group
in
any
one
district
is
not
tantamount
to
election.
however
convenient,
this
checklist
approach
of
the
majority
maybe,
it
cannot
be
supported
by
the
record
nor
by
the
constitutional
standards
set
out
by
this
court.
this
court
in
fact
has
never
utilized
a
checklist
and
inferentially
rejected
its
use
in
whitcomb
as
the
dissent
of
justice
douglas
showed,
all
of
the
factors
which
were
previously
set
out
in
burns
versus
richardson
were
existing
in
the
whitcomb
indiana
district
and
yet
it
was
upheld
as
constitutional.
furthermore,
the
districts
in
questions
are
smaller
than
any
heretofore
invalidated
by
this
court.
these
districts
range
in
size
from
one
electing
only
6%
of
the
texas
house
of
representatives
down
to
ones
electing
barely
1%
or
2
out
of
150
members
of
the
texas
legislature.
this
simply
is
not
a
case
involving
extremely
large
districts
electing
a
high
percentage
of
legislative
representatives.
the
state
of
texas
believes
that
whether
or
not
single-member
districts
are
desirable
in
any
of
these
districts,
and
if
so,
the
specific
design
of
the
districts
are
political
questions
at
this
point
and
are
not
constitutionally
required.
the
texas
legislature
does
not
act
in
the
area
of
reapportionment
only
one
pushed
and
pulled
by
a
federal
court,
although
their
actions
maybe
subsequently
challenged,
and
at
least
in
this
decade
were
two-for-two
on
that
score.
in
fact,
the
legislature
meeting
in
regular
session
right
now,
for
the
first
time
since
this
court
issued
its
opinion
in
round
one
of
white
versus
regester
is
today
this
wednesday,
conducting
a
hearing
on
two
single-member
district
bills
for
tarrant
county.
single-member
district
bills
have
also
been
introduced
for
other
counties
and
are
being
drafted
for
the
remainder.
on
the
basis
of
the
record
in
this
case,
on
the
erroneous
constitutional
standards
used
by
the
majority
and
on
the
failure
of
the
court
below
to
afford
the
texas
legislature
its
rightful
opportunity
to
reapportion,
we
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
be
reversed.
thank
you.
ms.
elizabeth
b.
levatino
yes,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
state
few
very
short
and
brief
comments.
first
of
all,
to
answer
the
question
which
you
posed
to
mr.
gladden,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
other
words
what
would
be
the
comment
on
a
minority
--
minority
inhabitant
district
which
consistently
elects
a
non-minority
person.
i
think
that
the
inference
from
that
must
be
that
they
like
the
people
that
they
represent
and
those
none
minority
members
do
represent
their
interest
well.
i
think
with
regard
to
tarrant
county,
it
must
be
remembered
that
blacks
are
part
of
these
coalitions,
that
blacks
have
backed
anglo
people
who
have
also
won,
and
that
the
labor-liberal
coalition
needs
the
black
votes
and
searches
for
them.
this
is
not
the
case
of
the
dcrg
as
you
saw
in
dallas
county
two
years
ago.
mr.
richards
mentioned
that
according
to
barbara
jordan,
the
change
in
the
texas
--
in
the
racial
makeup
of
the
texas
legislature
was
solely
attributable
to
reapportionment.
i
would
like
this
court
or
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
we
now
have
permanent
voting
registration
in
our
state,
which
was
not
the
case
when
this
first
round
of
regester
was
first
heard.
the
voting
rolls
have
risen
from
3.8
million
to
5.2
millions
since
1971.
additionally,
the
poll
tax
has
now
been
gone
since
appropriately
1966.
the
filing
fees
have
been
abolished
basically
are
brought
down
very
low
either
$150
or
1%
of
the
people
voting
in
the
prior
race
not
to
exceed
5,000
signatures,
the
access
to
voting
has
certainly
improved
dramatically.
we
have
roving
deputy
registrars
for
voting.
you
can
register
to
vote
by
mail,
and
your
registration
is
automatically
renewed
if
you
vote
once
every
three
years.
i
submit
that
these
are
some
of
the
reasons
that
there
also
has
been
a
dramatic
change
in
texas.
additionally,
the
statement
was
made
that
in
jefferson
county
cope
the
political
arm
of
the
afl-cio
never
endorsed
a
minority.
i
would
submit
that
the
record
reflects
that
mr.
price
was
endorsed
as
an
acceptable
candidate
in
1972.
he
then
received
48%
of
the
vote.
also,
an
endorsement
by
cope
is
not
tantamount
to
election.
as
the
record
reflects,
both
representatives,
powers
(ph)
and
doyle
who
were
in
that
delegation
at
that
time
of
the
trial
of
this
case
were
elected
without
that
endorsement.
with
regard
to
mclennan
and
travis
county
going
from
ward,
city
council
politics
to
the
at
large
election,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
those
at
large
elections
have
resulted
in
two
blacks
being
elected
to
the
mclennan
city
council
and
one
black
being
elected
twice
to
the
austin,
which
is
the
major
city
in
travis
council
--
in
travis
county.
again,
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
plans.
in
the
various
presentation
of
the
plans,
only
to
say
that
while
the
state
never
acquiesced
by
not
presenting
plans
we
maintain
throughout
the
trial
that
the
court,
if
it
found
any
districts
unconstitutional,
should
allow
the
legislature
to
reapportion.
it
had
never
been
given
that
opportunity
under
court
order.
additionally,
with
regard
to
the
plan
presented
in
jefferson
county
as
was
stated
here
earlier,
jefferson
county
is
composed
of
beaumont
and
port
arthur.
the
plan
which
was
submitted
as
agreed
to
by
the
members
of
the
delegation
from
jefferson
county
would
have
made
beaumont
one
district,
the
mid
county
area
one
district,
and
port
arthur
one
district.
however,
admittedly,
splitting
up
the
black
votes,
however
plaintiff's
plan
started
at
one
end
of
beaumont,
picking
up
as
many
blacks
as
they
could,
coming
all
the
way
through
the
mid
county
areas
and
down
into
port
arthur,
thereby,
admittedly
maximizing
the
minority
strength
in
that
district.
i
submit
that
the
legislative
intent
is
reflected
in
the
plans
we
did
submit,
was
that
of
the
members
of
the
delegations,
and
we
sought
to
do
no
more
while
maintaining
our
position
that
the
legislature
should
have
been
given
the
right
to
redistrict
if
necessary.
again,
i
submit
that
the
record
in
this
case
is
insufficient
for
a
federal
court
to
wipe
out
the
entire
state
policy
of
multimember
districts
based
on
the
evidence,
and
based
on
the
factors
utilized
by
the
federal
court
below.
thank
you.
