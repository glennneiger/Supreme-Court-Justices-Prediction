h.
rehnquist
well,
for
what
purpose
could
the
district
court
take
it
into
account?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
meaning
of
a
democratic
government,
i
would
think
is
that
when
i
go
into
the
ballot
box
and
vote
for
a
candidate,
i
can
vote
for
him
for
a
good
reason,
a
bad
reason
or
for
no
reason
at
all.
if
i
want
to
vote
against
a
man
because
he's
black,
if
i
want
to
vote
for
him
because
he's
black
or
white
or
brown,
that's
my
privilege
as
a
citizen,
i
would
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
representatives
are
there
in
jefferson
county?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
many
representative
in
jefferson
county?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
one
of
the
beaumont
and
port
arthur?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hat
had
been
the
history
of
mclennan
before
1971,
as
to
number
of
districts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
any
different
than,
if
you
have
instead
of
seven-street
group
and
the
liberal
labor,
republican
and
democratic
parties
and
your
argument
was,
neither
one
is
ever
--
has
ever
chosen
a
negro?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
[voice
overlap]
my
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
won't
repeat
it
at
all,
i'll
ask
you
another
one.
is
your
argument
basically
that,
in
a
system
where
you
have
open
access
to
the
ballot
as
you
apparently
do
in
forth
worth,
that
if
the
two
major
political
fractions
don't
nominate
negroes,
a
federal
court
has
to
step
in
and
do
something
about
the
districting?
