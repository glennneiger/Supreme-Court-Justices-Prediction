mr.
don
gladden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
be
discussing
tarrant
county
which
the
primary
city
in
tarrant
county
is
fort
worth,
where
adjacent
immediately
to
the
east
of
dallas
county,
and
i
feel
sort
of
that
was
good
for
dallas
county
perhaps
it's
good
for
tarrant
county,
and
that
we
would
like
to
participate
and
share
their
benefits
of
this
court's
action
relative
to
multimember
districts.
mr.
don
gladden
if
a
60%
majority
--
mr.
don
gladden
i
don't
understand
the
quote,
i'm
sorry
about
the
60%
minority,
and
minority
--
mr.
don
gladden
oh,
okay.
mr.
don
gladden
i
don't
think
that
situation
exists
in
texas
unless
it
perhaps
exists
in
hidalgo
county
where
there
is
a
substantial
mexican-american
in
essence
the
majority
and
they
elect
both
whites
and
mexican-americans.
in
tarrant
county,
we've
got
a
situation
which
unlike
mrs.
levatino
suggested
is
not
a
small
district.
it
has
a
population
of
675,000,
some
60,000
more
than
the
state
of
north
dakota
what
this
court
considered
in
the
chapman
case.
it
has
nine
members
that
are
all
elected
at
large,
it
has
82%
white
or
about
550,000.
it
has
12%
black
or
about
80,000
and
6%
chicano
or
mexican-american
or
about
40,000
in
population.
no
blacks
have
ever
been
elected
from
tarrant
county
to
the
texas
legislature.
now
i'd
like
to
qualify
the
words
tarrant
county
in
district
32,
because
actually
i'm
talking
about
district
32
here.
prior
to
1972,
tarrant
county
was
a
single-member
district.
as
of
1972,
the
legislative
redistricting
board
trimmed
the
excess
population,
from
the
rural
areas
of
tarrant
county
and
put
them
in
an
adjoining
district
so
as
to
reduce
it
to
a
nine-member
district.
mr.
don
gladden
no
your
honor--
mr.
don
gladden
we
have
a
primary
system
in
texas.
a
nomination
in
the
democratic
party
in
tarrant
county
is
tantamount
to
election
in
tarrant
county.
there
are
no
republican
--
just
as
blacks
and
chicano,
there
has
never
been
a
republican
elected
in
tarrant
county
or
in
district
32.
mr.
don
gladden
it
is
not
difficult
at
all
to
get
on
the
primary
ballot.
we
have
a
$100
--
in
fact,
we
used
to
have
a
$100
filing
fee,
i
guess
no
filing
fee
now,
thanks
to
this
court.
mr.
don
gladden
no,
you
can
just
go
in
and
sign
up
and
get
on
the
ballot,
but
we
--
mr.
don
gladden
yes
you
do
have.
it
is
a
place
system.
mr.
don
gladden
this
is
a
place
system
or
your
opponents
picks
you.
we
have
not
only
a
place
system
in
this
again
--
mr.
don
gladden
that's
very
true.
may
i
suggest
to
the
court,
first
of
all
an
error
in
our
brief,
on
page
46
we
cited
whitcomb
for
the
proposition
that
there
were
sub
districts
within
marion
county.
i
apologize,
that
is
not
true.
there
are
no
sub
districts
in
tarrant
county
or
in
district
32
to
require
a
person
to
live
in
any
geographical
area.
we
do
have
a
place
of
system,
where
you've
got
a
pick
place,
one
place,
two
place,
three
place,
four
place,
five,
so
on
through
to
nine.
the
numbers
of
people
who
picked
a
particular
place
depends
upon,
first
of
all
the
confusion
of
the
circumstances
and
the
fellow
that
you
want
to
run
against.
mr.
don
gladden
don't
think
that
there
is
any
question,
but
what
blacks
in
--
mr.
don
gladden
no,
slating--
mr.
don
gladden
slating
is
our
concern,
only
on
who
wins
not
as
to
access
of
the
ballot.
mr.
don
gladden
no
question
about--
mr.
don
gladden
--
any
black,
any
chicano
has
that
--
mr.
don
gladden
no,
i
do
not
your
honor.
i
say
that
it
is
an
action
of
discriminating
slating.
there
are
slating
procedures
--
mr.
don
gladden
okay.
all
but
the
evidence
is
that,
there
are
slating,
pre-primary
slating
procedures.
there
is
a
downtown
seventh
street
business
group
that
slates
county.
mr.
don
gladden
that's
very
true.
mr.
don
gladden
all
they
can
do
is
just
keep
them
from
wining,
your
honor.
mr.
don
gladden
yes,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
don
gladden
taking
into
consideration
all
the
other
fact
--
mr.
don
gladden
no,
it
wasn't
a
issue
on
whitcomb.
what
i'm
saying
is,
in
this
instance
that
slating
processes
go
on
that
in
order
for
a
person
that
evidence
in
this
case
is,
that
in
order
for
a
person
to
have
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
elected,
he
must
have
been
slated
either
by
the
labor,
literal
slate
--
mr.
don
gladden
or
by
the
seventh
street
group.
mr.
don
gladden
well,
the
evidence
is
that
you
don't
get
enough
polls
and
the
state
witnesses
when
called
upon
to
cite
one
example
of
one
legislator
who
had
been
elected
from
tarrant
county
that
did
not
have
either
one,
the
business
community
on
the
one
hand,
or
the
labor
literal
community
support
slating
on
the
other
hand,
and
representative
gabe
lewis
(ph)
thought
and
thought
and
thought
and
could
not
come
up
with
one
single
member
of
the
legislature
in
the
history
he'd
been
aware
of
politics.
so
it
doesn't
get
you
elected
to
be
slated
by
the
labor
people,
it
doesn't
get
you
elected
to
the
slated
by
the
business
group
but
you
can't
make
it
without
being
slated
by
one
of
them.
mr.
don
gladden
this
is
very
true,
this
is
very
true.
if
i
may
go
ahead
and
talk
to
--
mr.
don
gladden
yes,
and
again
from
a
meaningful
opportunity
of
getting
your
name
on
the
ballot
and
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
endorsed
and
elected
is
the
question.
no
black
has
ever
been
elected
and
if
i
may
--
mr.
don
gladden
blacks
were
slated
twice.
mr.
don
gladden
no
your
honor.
first
in
1968,
first
black
ran
in
1968.
in
1968,
the
white
community
voted
75%
for
the
white
candidate,
25%
for
the
black,
the
black
community
voted
89%
for
the
black
candidate,
and
11%
for
the
white
candidate,
and
he
lost.
in
1972
--
mr.
don
gladden
yes,
the
fellow
from
the
business
slate
won.
the
black
was
slated
by
the
liberal
community.
mr.
don
gladden
it
sure
would,
but
the
business
slate
has
never
slated
a
black.
in
1972,
a
black
was
slated
by
the
labor
group
and
he
ran
a
very
respectable
race.
he
spent
$25,000
of
his
own
money
going
only
1400
or
so
from
the
black
community.
he
was
a
prominent
businessman.
he
ran
a
no
distinguishing
type
campaign
and
did
not
make
disclosures
that
he
was
black
and
in
the
circumstance
cited
again
in
the
chapman
case
with
a
confused
nine-place
system,
the
community
probably
didn't
know
about
mr.
webber
being
black.
they
knew
about
it,
the
fact
that
he
was
a
prominent
businessman,
and
he
again
picked
up
25%
of
the
white
community,
but
lost
75%
and
about
85%
of
the
black
community.
mr.
don
gladden
in
essence
is,
and
it's
also
the
same
circumstance
that
justice
white
raised
about
the
fact
that
if
you
do
slate
a
black,
does
he
ever
win?
and
the
answer
is,
is
no,
he
never
wins,
he
never
has
win
and
bobby
webber,
the
black
who
ran
in
1972
and
came
close,
the
state
made
issue
at
the
trial
of
the
case
saying,
well
boy
you
know,
bobby
just
ran
close
to
$25,000,
don't
you
think
he
is
going
to
win
next
time?
he
dropped
to
43%
because
it
was
suggested
in
the
trial
of
this
case
that
it
was
because,
there
--
mr.
don
gladden
i'm
sorry,
would
you
repeat
the
question?
mr.
don
gladden
i
think
that
if
in
forth
worth
if
in
a
multi
member
district,
where
you
see
a
submergence
of
a
minority
interest
that
does
not
have
access
to
the
slating
process,
yes,
i
feel
like
--
mr.
don
gladden
i
would
say
it
was
--
mr.
don
gladden
i
would
say,
if
it
was
done
with
intent
--
mr.
don
gladden
i
would
say
if
it
was
done
with
intent
to
dilute
the
minority
strength
that
it
would
--
mr.
don
gladden
well,
this
is
very
true,
now
then
if
i
may
-
mr.
don
gladden
yes
your
honor.
mr.
don
gladden
not
to
my
knowledge
by
the
business
group
or
the
labor
group.
mr.
don
gladden
well
there
never
have
been
any
serious
challenges
in
house
races.
there
is
presently
in
the
southern
part
of
the
county,
a
senatorial
district
that
a
republican
presently
holds,
but
there's
never
been
one
county
--
legislate
or
county-wide.
mr.
don
gladden
republicans
were
parties
plaintiffs
to
this
litigation.
mr.
don
gladden
yes,
and
they
file
plans
and
--
mr.
don
gladden
mr.
jim
george
of
austin,
texas
your
honor,
represented
the
republican
party
claim.
mr.
don
gladden
the
republicans
made
that
same
claim,
your
honor.
mr.
don
gladden
we
carry
it
forward,
yes.
we
feel--
mr.
don
gladden
i
think
so.
i
think
that
political
philosophy
and
economics
also
was
an
issue
in
our
case
of
economic
discrimination.
thank
you
very
much.
