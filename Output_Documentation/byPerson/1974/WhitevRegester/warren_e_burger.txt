chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1462,
white
against
regester.
mrs.
levatino,
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
you
conceive
that
the
court
may
appropriately
take
into
account
what
the
label
and
for
purposes
of
this
case
are
racist
to
campaign
tactics?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
position
doesn't
give
you
any
trouble
with
the
first
amendment?
does
the
first
amendment
guarantee
candidates
or
even
to
engage
in
what
everyone
would
condemn
in
terms
of
descent
campaigning,
but
doesn't
the
first
amendment
guarantee
them
the
right
to
say
what
they
want
to
say
in
a
campaign?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
couldn't
a
negro
candidate
go
out
in
campaign
directly
attacking
whites
as
whites
and
couldn't
mexican-american
do
the
same
thing
or
a
white?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
are
you
saying
that
the
court
may
take
into
account
conduct
which
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
to
--
in
this
formula
as
the
court
obviously
did
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
took
into
account,
what
are
labeled
in
this
case
as
racist
campaign
tactics?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
richards?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
richards,
mr.
gladden?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
get
on
to
that,
let
me
ask
you
this.
if
a
particular
district,
where
60%
are
representation
of
the
minority
or
any
other
group
consistently
elects
a
non
minority
group,
what
inferences
are
to
be
drawn
from
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
minority,
consistently
elects
someone
not
in
the
minority
group?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
a
district
has
60%
combined
mexican-americans
and
negroes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
consistently
elect
twice,
what
point
has
to
be
made
in
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mrs.
levatino?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
levatino,
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
73-1462,
white
against
regester.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
filed
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
vacated.
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
recent
texas
reapportionment
legislation
and
for
dismissal
of
the
case
if
the
case
if
the
is
or
becomes
moot.
mr.
justice
douglas

no
part
in
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
this
case.
