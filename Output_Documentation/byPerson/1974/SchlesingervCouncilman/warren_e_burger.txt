we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
73-662,
schlesinger
against
councilman.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
consider
it
a
particular
importance
that
this
was
a
transaction
between
a
captain
and
an
enlisted
man
who
is
under
his
command?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
though
they
were
off
base
and
out
of
uniform?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
do
you
not
have
the
related
factor
that
comes
into
this
picture
somewhere,
if
enlisted
men
generally
get
the
impression
that
the
officers
tolerate
the
use
of
marijuana
or
other
drugs
which
would
go
to
your
broad-based
argument
about
maintenance
of
discipline,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
garrett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
garrett,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
this
was
a
clerk
typist
but
known
to
the
captain
as
a
member
of
the
military
force.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
would
it
make
any
difference
to
your
case
if
he'd
been
a
lieutenant,
first-lieutenant,
second-lieutenant
instead
of
a
clerk
typist?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
just
a
man?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
might
make
a
difference
if
a
captain
gave
a
party
and
then
invited
a
dozen
enlisted
men
and
they
all
made
very
excessive
use
of
alcohol
and,
ultimately,
the
party
went
public
and
you
had
a
public
count
in
this
criminal
act
you're
talking
about.
do
you
think
that
might
conceivably
be
different
from
the
private
party?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
possession
of
marijuana
does
not
need
to
be
in
public
in
order
to
be
a
criminal
act,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
meyers.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
relation
with
an
enlisted
man.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
up.
mr.
solicitor
general,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
73-662,
schlesinger
against
councilman
and
in
73-64,
iannelli
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
