powell,

in
schlesinger,
the
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
involves
the
relationship
between
the
federal
civilian
courts
and
the
military
court
system.
respondent,
an
army
captain
was
charged
with
marijuana
offenses
committed
while
off
duty
and
off
base.
he
obtained
a
federal
court
injunction
against
his
being
tried
by
military
court
martial.
the
court
of
appeals
finding
that
the
marijuana
offenses
were
not
service
connected
held
that
a
military
court
lack
jurisdiction
to
try
them.
accordingly,
it
sustained
the
injunction.
we
agreed
to
review
the
case
to
resolve
conflicting
views
as
to
respective
powers
and
responsibilities
of
article
3
civilian
courts
as
compared
with
those
of
military
courts.
although
we
conclude
that
the
district
court
did
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
we
think
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
that
there
was
no
occasion
in
this
case
for
the
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction.
the
system
of
military
courts
was
established
by
the
congress
which
recognized
that
the
military
is
a
specialized
society
separate
from
civilian
society
with
laws
and
traditions
of
its
own
developed
during
a
long
history.
strong
considerations
of
policy
including
the
expertise
of
the
military
courts
favor
exhaustion
of
remedies
within
that
system
before
it
resort
to
review
our
collateral
attack
in
civilian
courts.
we
find
nothing
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
justified
injunctive
action
by
the
civilian
courts.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
chief
justice
filed
a
separate
statement
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
douglas,
mr.
justice
brennan,
and
mr.
justice
marshall
concurred
in
part
and
dissented
in
part.
