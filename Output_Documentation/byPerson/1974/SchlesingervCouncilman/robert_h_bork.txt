mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
respondent,
captain
councilman
is
under
court-martial
charges
for
violating
article
134
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
the
general
article,
by
wrongfully
selling,
transferring,
and
possessing
marijuana.
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
captain
councilman
was
off
post,
off
duty,
and
out
of
uniform.
although
stationed
at
fort
sill,
oklahoma,
he
was
then
in
his
apartment
in
langley,
oklahoma.
the
sale
and
transfer
of
marijuana
were
to
a
man
who
councilman
believed
to
be
an
enlisted
man
also
not
in
uniform
and
off
duty.
he
believed
him
to
be
a
clerk
typist
at
fort
sill.
he
was,
in
fact,
an
enlisted
undercover
agent
for
the
army's
criminal
investigation
detachment
which
was
investigating
a
report
that
the
captain
used
marijuana
at
his
apartment.
councilman
moved
to
dismiss
the
charges
against
him
on
the
ground
that
the
court-martial
lacked
jurisdiction
because
the
crimes
were
not
service-connected
under
o'callahan
against
parker.
the
presiding
military
judge
denied
that
motion
and
councilman
then
brought
this
action
to
the
district
court
which,
on
the
grounds
of
absence
of
service-connection,
permanently
enjoined
the
military
authorities
from
proceeding
with
the
court-martial
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
this
case
put
in
play
two
important
issues.
the
first
is
the
propriety
of
the
district
court's
intervention
in
a
pending
court-martial
proceeding.
the
second
is
the
rationale
and
application
of
the
service-connection
test
for
court-martial
jurisdiction.
these
are
both
issues
of
serious
concern
to
the
government
for
they
bear
directly
upon
the
effectiveness
of
the
armed
forces.
we
submit,
in
the
first
place,
that
the
district
court
should
not
have
interfered
with
this
court-martial
and
the
reasons
for
that
conclusion
are
interrelated.
they
are
the
doctrines
we
discussed
yesterday
of
comedy
and
exhaustion
of
remedies.
we've
also
contended
that
the
finality
provision
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
article
76
precludes
review
by
any
mode
other
than
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
our
arguments
yesterday
in
mclucas
against
de'champlain
dealt
with
the
principles
of
exhaustion
and
comedy--
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
comedy
and
here,
as
there,
we
rely
upon
younger
against
harris
and
gusik
against
schilder.
the
military
justice
system
is
a
coordinate
judicial
system
with
a
series
of
appellate
stages
through
which
any
conviction
must
be
tested
and
strained.
the
ordinary
considerations
of
avoiding
duplication,
waste
of
judicial
resources,
and
so
forth
apply
here
as
they
did
in
younger
and
in
gusik.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
virtually
so,
mr.
justice
stewart,
except
for
one
point
and
that
is
that
i
wish
to
distinguish
the
line
of
cases
billings
against
truesdale
and
toth
against
quarles
and
so
forth
because
of
the
nature
of
the
trial
that
is
required
on
a
service-connection
issue
and
i
will
just--
i
will
not
repeat
the
argument
about
younger
against
harris
or
gusik
against
schilder
in
the
ordinary
consideration.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
the
nature
of
a
trial
required
on
the
service-connection
issue.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
that
is
why
i
wish
to
say
that
it
is
semantically
possible,
mr.
justice
marshall,
to
make
this
case
sound
as
if
it
were
similar
to
toth
against
quarles
or
reid
against
covert
or
that
line
of
cases,
because
it
can
be
put
in
terms
that
the
question
is
the
military's
power
to
try
the
man.
but,
i
think
it's
quite
different
from
those
cases
because
in
those
cases
the
military's
lack
of
power
to
try
the
man
comes
from
his
status
and
not
from
his
conduct,
and
it's
a
quite
simple
trial.
in
fact,
it's
solely
a
legal
issue
whether
the
man
is
a
civilian
or
a
military
man,
whether,
if
he
is
a
civilian,
the
military
has
a
constitutional
power
to
try
him.
here,
however,
the
question
of
the
power
to
try
him
and
it's
quite
different,
i
think,
when
a
man
is
not
a
civilian
but
is
a
military
man
who
is
ordinarily
subject
to
military
discipline
and
military
jurisdiction
and,
in
addition,
when
the
claim
that
he
may
not
be
tried
rests
upon
the
factual
details
of
what
he
did
and
where
he
did
it
and
so
forth,
because
that
means
that
when
a
service-connection
issue
is
raised,
if
he
can
go
into
a
federal
district
court,
in
many
cases,
there
should
be
a
small
trial
of
the
crime
to
get
out
the
details.
in
fact,
i
think
in
this
case
it
may
be
that
this
stipulation
is
seriously
inadequate.
i
don't
know.
if
district
courts
are
going
to
come
into
these
cases,
i
will
advice
you
as
attorneys
and
military
lawyers
to
make
much
fuller
records
than
this
so
we
can
find
out
about
service-connection
much
more
effectively.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
consider
that
of
crucial
importance
on
the
service-connection
issue,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
the
jurisdictional
issue,
however,
i
don't
think
that
it's--
it
bears
this
directly.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i--
by
the
jurisdictional
issue,
i
meant
initially
whether
a
district
court
ought
ever
to
entertain
a
claim
like
this
before
the
military
process
has
run
its
course
and
i
think,
on
a
service-connection
issue,
it
ought
not.
on--
i
think
it's
clear
that
it
is
a
service-connected
and
i
will
argue
to
that
effect
in
a
moment,
but
i
wish
to
complete
the
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question.
if
you
may
go
into
a
civilian
court
in
advance
of
a
court-martial,
the
civilian
court
in
many
cases
will
have
to
hear
the
facts
of
the
crime
to
determine
the
service-connection
issue.
if
the
civilian
court
determines
it
is
service-connected,
you
will
then
go
back
for
a
full
military
trial.
so,
you'll
have
two
trials:
one
civilian
and
one
military.
if
the
civilian
court
determines
it
is
not
service-connected,
you
will
then
have
two
civilian
trials:
one
on
the
injunctive
action
and
one
presumably
when
the
local
prosecutor
brings
a
charge
under
the
criminal
law,
the
civilian
criminal
law.
so,
i
think
there's
quite
a
waste
of
resources
in
this
kind
of
a
service-connection
case
which
is
necessarily
a
factual
case.
if
you
have
it
proceed
to
the
military,
then
you
need
have
only
one
trial
of
the
fact
and
a
court
looking
at
habeas
corpus
later
on
the
service-connection
issue.
they
rely
on
the
military
record.
in
addition
to
that,
there
is
in
the
service-connection
issue
necessarily
an
expert
judgment
about
the
effect
of
the
behavior
upon
the
discipline,
the
morale,
the
effectiveness
of
the
armed
forces.
and,
i
think
that
judgment
initially
should
be
made
and
illuminated
by
military
tribunals
with
the
expertise.
it
may
then
be
reviewed
on
habeas
corpus
by
a
civilian
court
with
the
issues
so-illuminated,
and
i
think
that
is
why
this
case
is
a
very
different
kind
of
a
case,
both
in
terms
of
expertise
and
in
terms
of
trial
of
factual
matters
than
the
toth
v.
quarles
or
billings
against
truesdale
line
of
cases,
and
why
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
comedy
is
particularly
appropriate
here.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
mentioned
the
issue
raised
in
this
case
by
the
fact
that
the
marijuana
sale
and
transfer
charges
involve
the
sale
and
transfer
of
marijuana
by
an
officer,
captain
councilman,
to
a
man
whom
he
knew
to
be
an
enlisted
man
and
the
enlisted
man
he
knew
understood
him
to
be
an
officer.
and,
i
think
that
makes
the
first
two
charges
in
this
case
quite
clearly
service-connected.
o'callahan
and
parker
and
relford
against
commandant
were
cases
which
explicate
a
number
of
the
criteria
that
are
relevant
in
judging
service-connection,
but
the
relford
opinion
explicitly
recognizes
that
those
factors
are
not
a
closed
set.
that's
not
a
codification
that,
further,
is
a
common
law
development
in
this
c--
in
this
field,
and
i
think
the
o'callahan
case
indicates
the
rationale
which
guides
that
common
law
development
of
these
cases
and
it
grows
out
of
congress'
constitutional
power
which
exists
because
the
exigencies
of
military
discipline
require
the
existence
of
special
courts
with
special
expertise
and
special
jurisdiction.
so,
i
think,
the
offense
is
service-connected
when
it
bears
upon
discipline,
morale,
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
armed
forces.
and,
when
the
armed
forces
have
a
reason
of
their
own,
which
is
distinct
from
that
held
in
common
with
civilian
society,
to
be
seriously
concerned
about
the
offense,
and
that's
certainly
true
here.
the
rationale
of
service-connection
indeed,
i
think,
is
very
similar
to
the
rationale
of
article
134
under
which
captain
councilman
is
charged.
article
134
prohibits
all
disorders
and
neglect
to
the
prejudice
of
good
order
and
discipline
in
the
armed
forces.
so,
both
issues,
the
jurisdictional
and
the
substantive,
the
service-connection
and
disorders
and
neglects
are
given
meaning
by
the
unique
nature
of
the
special
needs
and
the
vital
mission
of
the
military.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
those
two
rationales
correspond
to
the
different
charges.
i
was
addressing,
initially,
the
relationship
of
officer
to
enlisted
man
and
the
destructive
impacts
of
shared
criminal
behavior
upon
that
relationship.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
wouldn't
say
shared
behavior
of
any
kind,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
socializing
or,
yes--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
true.
i
think
the
service-connection
become
particularly
apparent
when
the
shared
behavior
is
criminal
behavior
and
known
to
be
such
by
both
participants
because
i
think
that
is
particularly
destructive
to
morale
and,
as
word
of
it
spreads
around
as
it
will,
when
an
officer
engages
in
this
kind
of
behavior,
destructive
to
the
authority
of
all
officers
in
that
commander,
indeed,
if
another
commanders
hear
about
it.
but,
i
intend
to
address
as
well
the
fact
that
possession
of
marijuana,
irrespective
of
the
relationship
to
the
enlisted
man,
is
also
service-connected.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
two
distinct
rationales,
both
of
which
i
think
apply
to
this
case
and
both
which
i
think
uphold
service-connection.
we
have
just
discussed
that
it's
hardly
relevant
to
the
destructive
impact
of
shared
criminal
behavior
between
an
officer
and
an
enlisted
man
whether
it
takes
place
on
post
or
off
post,
or
in
or
out
of
uniform,
or
on
or
off
duty.
the
relationship
between
those
men
is
effectively
destroyed.
as
word
gets
back
in
this
closed
society,
which
the
military
is
quite
a
close
in
its
society,
a
society
in
which
has
a
great
deal
of
gossip
and
rumor,
it
will
undercut
the
authority
of
all
officers
in
that
command.
and,
i
think
one
need
not
strain
one's
imagination
to
think
of
a
variety
of
criminal
offenses
that
are
wholly
destructive
of
the
relationship
the
armed
forces
must
require.
in
fact,
there
may
be
such
offenses
which
are
criminal
under
the
uniform
code
which
are
not
criminal
under
a
state
code.
so
that
if
it
occurs
in
certain
jurisdictions,
civilian
authorities
will
be
without
power
to
prosecute
but
the
military,
nevertheless,
has
a
vital
interest
in
seeing
that
that
kind
of
behavior
does
not
take
place
between
officers
and
enlisted
men.
and,
i
think
that
much
can
hardly
be
denied.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
it
had
been--
i
think
fraternizing
with
an
enlisted
man
might
have
called
for
disciplinary
activity
by
the
military.
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
a
general
court.
i
think
drinking
with
an
enlisted
man
is
severely
discouraged.
it
might
have
called
for
a
reprimand.
if
repeated,
it
might
have
called
for
a
more
serious
punishment.
but,
since
the
underlying
activity
is
not
in
itself
criminal,
the
initial
response
of
the
military,
i
suspect,
would
have
been
milder
than
this.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
a
distinction--
no,
i
think
the
distinction
between
alcohol
and
drugs
is
simply
that
if
we're
talking
about
the
use
rather
than
the
relationship
between
the
two
men
is
simply
that
the
military,
as
civilian
society,
chooses
to
regard
only
over
use
of
alcohol
as
an
offense
where
they
tend
to
regard
any
use
of
drugs
as
an
offense,
and
that's
a
judgment
which
i
think
is
essentially
a
legislative
judgment
and
i
think
an
allowable
one.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
in
fact,
we
have
jurisdictions
now
i
think--
well,
one
thing
is
certainly
true,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
and
that
is
that
the
treatment
of
marijuana
possession
or
use
by
various
localities
and
states
varies
enormously.
there
are--
we've
heard
of
cases
where
15
years
for
a
possession
of
minor
amounts
of
marijuana.
there
are
other
jurisdictions
where
the
offense
is
almost
not
prosecuted.
so
that
the
military's
distinctive
interest
in
this
may
be
not
vindicated
at
all
by
the
civilian
authorities
or
it
may
be
over-vindicated
in
some
sense,
maybe
much
harsher
than
the
military
would
chose
to
treat
the
matter.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
didn't
suggest
that,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
think
it
would
be.
i
was
suggesting
that
the
service
is
a
response
to
an
officer
having
a
drink
with
an
enlisted
man
might
be
not
as--
at
the
same
level
of
concern
and
it
might
justify
a
milder
level
of
punishment
than
its
response
to
an
activity
which
is
itself
criminal
and
the
use
of
a
drug,
although
it
might
have
a
response,
a
disciplinary
response,
to
fraternization
between
an
officer
and
enlisted
man.
but,
fraternization
in
a
criminal
activity
is
a
far
more
serious
fraternization
and
far
more
destructive
of
morale
and
discipline
than
other
forms
of
fraternization.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
we're
talking
about
the
possession
issue
alone,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
possession
of
marijuana
is
certainly
treated
as
a
crime
by
the
military,
whereas
the
possession
of
alcohol
is
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
the--
only
if
it
reaches
a
level
where
it
does
become
destructive
of
discipline.
i
suspect
that
fraternization
which
was
regarded
as
unseemly
would
be
handled
by
a
word
to
the
officer.
fraternization
which
becomes
destructive
of
the
relationship
which
the
military
must
foster
will
ultimately
reach
a
criminal
level
in
that
sense.
fraternization
which
involves
participation
in
a
criminal
activity
is
obviously
a
crime,
but
i
wanted
to
reach
the
issue
of
possession
because--
and
i
may
say
on
the
other
issue,
the--
when
it
is
behavior
between
an
officer
and
an
enlisted
man
that
is
criminal,
the
civilian
courts
will
never
fully
vindicate
the
military's
interest
because
there
is
no
element
of
any
civilian
crime
which
consists
of
the
discipline
that--
the
discipline-destroying
aspect
of
this
relationship.
now,
the
charge
of
possession
i
think
is
equally
serious
and
i
think
equally
service-connected.
the
military
regard
the
use
of
drugs
as
highly
detrimental
to
effective
military
performance.
they
may
not
be
in
any
individual
case.
that
is
hard
to
say.
on
the
average,
the
military
has
good
reason
to
know
that
the
use
of
drugs
is
highly
destructive
to
the
efficacy
of
the
armed
forces.
now,
it
may
be
that
a
variety
of
civilian
jurisdictions
will
ultimately
decriminalize
marijuana.
it
may
be
that
many
of
them
won't.
the
military
cannot
afford
to
decriminalize
marijuana
because
they
think,
on
a
basis
of
experience,
on
a
basis
of
evidence
that
the
drug
tends
to
decrease
efficacy,
and
that
cannot
be
tolerated
by
an
army.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
will
if
overused,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
suspect
that
the--
i'm
sure
that
the
impact
of
the
drug
on
personal
wellbeing
is
the
same
whether
you're
in
uniform,
out
of
uniform,
or
on
base,
or
off
base.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
true.
an
abuse
of
alcohol
is
a
military
offense
off
base
or
on
base.
the
military
regards
that
as
an
offense.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
right.
it
certainly
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
one
must
look
at
this
as
a
widespread
problem
in
the
army.
this
is
not
a
problem
of
captain
councilman
and
a
few
of
his
off
duty
peccadilloes.
this
is
a
serious
widespread
concern
to
the
military.
now,
i
think
at
page
17
of
our
brief,
to
illustrate
the
problem,
we
have
some
figures
which
show
how
serious
the
problem
is.
and,
on
page
17
and
running
around
18,
the
brief
states
that,
in
2
years,
over
86,000
servicemen
underwent
rehabilitation
for
drug
use
and
that
48%
of
those
were
unable
to
return
to
active
duty.
now,
that
means
something
like
a
little
over
40,000
men
in
2
years
were
lost
of
the
army--
of
the
armed
forces
through
drug
use,
and
that
is
the
equivalent
of
2
army
divisions
being
lost
without
being
fired
and
that'
the
kind
of
problem
we're
talking
about
and
the
kind
of
problem
the
military
faces.
a
civilian
society,
in
balancing
its
values,
may
decide
it
doesn't
care
about
efficiency,
about
effectiveness,
and
what
an
individual
does
to
himself
is
his
own
concern
and
there
may
be
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
that
individual.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i'm--
yes,
it's
a
marijuana
case.
i
perhaps
should
confine
it
to
that,
but
marijuana,
the
military
thinks
as
many
people
think,
has
some
relationship,
and
not
a
perfect
one
but
then
again
not
a
insignificant
one,
to
other
drug
use.
and,
in
itself,
is
increasingly
thought
to
be
harmful
and
particularly
thought
to
be
harmful
to
motivation.
heavy
uses
of--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
that's
correct
but
i
think
it's
fundamentally
a
mistake
for
us
to
think
that
if
a
society
has
learned
to
tolerate
alcohol
over
a
period
of
years
and
punish
only
its
severe
abuse
in
the
military,
that
it
then
becomes
somehow
unconstitutional
or
illegal
for
that
society
to
make
a
different
judgment
about
marijuana,
whose
effects
in
some
respects
may
be
similar
and
in
some
respects
may
be
different,
but
i
think
it's
an
allowable
legislative
judgment
that,
on
a
basis
of
present
knowledge
and
on
a
basis
of
the
experience
we
have,
marijuana
may
be
regarded
by
any
jurisdiction,
civilian
or
military,
as
a
more
serious
threat.
the
military
so
regards
it,
and
i
think
allowably.
in
fact,
i
think
much
of
the
contrary
feeling
to
my
own
about
this
case
rests
upon
an
unarticulated
notion
that,
perhaps,
marijuana
ought
to
be
decriminalized.
i
don't
know
whether
marijuana
ought
to
be
decriminalized
or
not.
i
do
think
that's
a
judgment
for
each
jurisdiction
involved,
and
the
military
has
made
its
judgment.
i
certainly
think
it's
a
very
reasonable
judgment
for
the
military
to
make
and,
therefore,
one
that
not--
ought
not
to
be
upset.
this
is
a
massive
problem
for
the
military.
they
have
lost
a
great
deal
of
efficiency
and
loss
of
personnel
through
the
drug
problem,
of
which
the
marijuana
problem
is
a
part.
so,
i
think
both--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
it
is
a
drug,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
mili--
i'm
not
quite--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes.
i'm
not
quite
certain
why
the
subject
of
alcohol
rises
here
because
the
military
does
concern
itself
with
the
abuse
of
alcohol.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
aboard
ship.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
aboard
ship,
that's
certainly
true,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
the
navy
would
take
the
position
that
drug
possession
off
base,
out
of
uniform
is
service-connected,
whereas
alcohol
possession
off
base,
out
of
uniform
they
would
not
regard
as
service-connected.
and,
i
think
that's
an
allowable
legislative
distinction,
an
allowable
judgment.
it's
one
that
our
society
generally
makes
and
i
don't
see
why
it
should
be
denied
to
the
military
and
i
think,
indeed,
is
justified.
for
these
reasons,
i
think
both
because
of
the
relationship
between
the
officer
and
the
enlisted
man
in
a
known
criminal
transaction
which
the
civilian
courts
cannot
fully
vindicate
and
the
possession
issue,
which
i
think
the
military
is
entitled
to
view
as
service-connected
because
of
its
disastrous
effect
upon
efficiency
and
upon
availability
of
manpower
as
shown
by
the
statistics.
i
think
both
of
these
offenses,
if
the
merits
of
this
case
are
reached
contrary
to
our
submission
that
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
require
that
the
judgment
be
reversed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
so.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
read
that.
i
was
reading
that
yesterday
trying
to
tell
and,
as
i
recall,
mr.
justice
stewart--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
was.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
a
civilian--
i
don't
know
of
a--
one
of
hand,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
that
is
the--
unfortunately,
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
might
not
be
one.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
civilian
courts--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
don't.
there--
i--
in
generally--
in
general,
the
military
courts
think
it
is
and
civilian
courts
have
thought
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
wish
to
respond
more
fully
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
about
the
cases.
at
the
time
you
asked
me,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
was
perfectly
accurate
in
saying
i
did
not
know
of
any
such
cases.
the
situation
has
changed.
on
pages
714
and
15
of
the
government's
brief
in
footnote
4,
running
over
from
page
14
to
15,
there
is
a
citation
of
some
civilian
courts
that
have
held
drug
offenses
off
post,
including
a
marijuana
offense,
to
be
service-connected.
and,
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
on
page
14,
there
is
an
instance
where
one
military
judge
held
a
marijuana
offense
not
to
be
service-connected.
