justice
potter
stewart
is
your
argument
on
this
branch
of
the
case
identical
to
the
arguments
you
made?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you're
incorporating
that
by
reference.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you
have
one
additional
argument,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
or
at
least
something
additional
you
need
to
say
in
view
of
those
cases,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
speaking
of
the
differences
between
this
kind
of
an
offense
in
military
society
contrasted
to
what
it
would
be
in
civilian
society,
are
you
concentrating
on
the
military's
attitude
toward
the
possession
and
use
of
marijuana
or
are
you
concentrating
on
the--
emphasizing
on
the
traditions
in
the
military
that
officers
and
enlisted
men
do
not
fraternize?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
shared
behavior
of
any
kind,
unless
times
have
changed
since
i
was
in
the
military.
justice
potter
stewart
off
duty,
except
in
the
military
mission.
justice
potter
stewart
except
in
the
military
mission.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there
are
two
distinct
differences.
justice
potter
stewart
though,
if
this
had
been
alcohol
as
to
the
matter,
i
mean
alcoholic
beverage
instead
of
marijuana?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
wouldn't
alcohol
also?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
off
based,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
same
is
true
with
alcohol,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
alcohol
problem
must
be
a
part
also.
it's
a
drug,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
in
your
brief
on
pages
17
and
18
the
two
are
linked,
i
noticed,
at
least
by
the
title
of
the
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the--
on
review
of
military
drug
and
alcohol
programs.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the--
unless,
again,
times
have
changed
in
the
one
branch
of
the
military,
i.e.
the
united
states
navy,
has
concerned
itself
not
only
with
the
abuse
of
alcohol,
with
any
possession
of
any
kind
of
alcohol--
justice
potter
stewart
on
any
ship
of
the
united
states
navy,
yes?
justice
potter
stewart
is
toth
against
quarles
an
injunction?
that
was
a
habeas
corpus,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
difficult
to
tell
from
the
opinion,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
footnote
number
2
or
3
or
somewhere
indicates
it
was
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
garrett,
are
you
or
is
your
colleague
going
to
address
the
jurisdictional
question?
justice
potter
stewart
your
colleague
is
going
to
deal
with
the
jurisdictional
question?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
meyers,
we're
not
talking
about
the
merits
of
the
case.
i
mean,
the
jurisdictional
question,
i
think,
doesn't
depend
upon
the
element
merits
of
your
claim,
does
it?
it
depends
upon
the--
whether
or
not
every
single
court-martial
can
be
tested
out
and
advanced
in
a
federal
district
court
by
way
of
the
punitive
defendant,
the
proof
defendant,
the
court-martial
defendant
bringing,
as
a
plaintiff,
an
action
for
an
injunction.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's--
is
that
the
only
way
to
put
it?
it
really
is
whether
or
not
a
federal
district
court
has
any
jurisdiction
at
all
over
this
kind
of
a
claim
or
whether
the
only
function
of
the
civilian
courts
is
to
deal
with
habeas
corpus
applications.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
up
to
the
civilian
court
in
an
injunctive--
in
an
action
for
an
injunction
to
determine
the
question,
you
say,
up
to
the
federal--
justice
potter
stewart
to
a
federal
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
this
would
mean
that
in
every
single
case
where
there's
a
threat
in
court-martial
the
defendant
could
come
into
a
federal
district
court
and
try
this
question
out
in
the
federal
district
court
in
an
action
for
an
injunction
to
enjoin
the
military
court-martial,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
cases
do
you
have
where--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
an
injunctive
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it
had
taken
him
up
to--
justice
potter
stewart
back
to
korea.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that's
correct.
it
was
a
pre-trial
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
right,
those
were
post
convictions.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
action
was
one
for
habeas
corpus.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
an
injunction?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
an
action?
justice
potter
stewart
except
for
the
case
that
we
heard
yesterday
in
avrech.
are
there
any
other
cases
where--
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
in
your
brief,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
in
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
dooley?
justice
potter
stewart
the
way
you
explain
it,
it
was
sort
of
a
decision
on
the
merits.
the
general
civilian
court
did
not
refrain
from
entertaining
jurisdiction,
the
way
you
explained
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
just
denied
the
injunction,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
merits.
justice
potter
stewart
but
didn't--
but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
say,
as
you
explained
it
to
us,
that
the
district
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
matter,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
simply
think
so.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
is
step
one
only.
justice
potter
stewart
and
step
one
is--
