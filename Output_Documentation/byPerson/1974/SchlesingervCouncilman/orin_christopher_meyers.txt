mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
portion
of
our
argument
is
devoted
to
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
federal
district
court,
injunction
of
the
pending
court-martial.
our
argument
here
is
predicated
on
this
court
finding
that
there
is
no
service-connection
on
these
facts.
if
the
court
does
find
that
there
is
sufficient
service-connection
to
allowing
court-martial
prosecution
in
the
off
post,
out
of
uniform,
off
duty,
etcetera
possession
and
transfer
of
marijuana,
then
it
is
true
and
i
would
agree
that
captain
councilman
should
stand
trial
by
court-martial.
but
if,
however,
you
agree
that
there
was
not
sufficient
service-connection
here
and
that
if
captain
councilman
is
to
be
tried,
he
should
be
tried
by
civilian
authorities
instead
of
military
authorities
then
the
court-martial
has
no
jurisdiction
and
has
no
authority
at
all
to
try
this
man
and
we
have,
therefore,
no
duty
to
exhaust
our
remedies
within
the
military
system.
now,
this
court--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i
did
intend
to
reach
that,
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
way
that
i
intend
to
reach
it
is
to
develop,
first
of
all,
whether
the
military
has
the
jurisdiction
to
try
an
individual
for
a
particular
offense.
as
i
was
saying,
this
court
has
set
out
in
the
o'callahan
opinion
a
two-step
inquiry
to
determine
whether
the
military
court
has
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
to
try
a
person.
this
two-step
inquiry
requires
asking
the
question,
first
of
all,
is
this
individual
subject
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice?
and
if
that
question
be
answered
in
the
affirmative,
then
the
second
question
arises.
the
second
question
being,
is
this
particular
offense
which
is
alleged
here
sufficiently
service-connected
to
allow
the
military
court
to
have
jurisdiction?
now,
unless
both
of
these
questions
be
answered
in
the
affirmative,
then
the
military
court
has
no
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
to
try
an
individual.
the
question
then
arises
if
an
individual
finds
himself
in
this
position,
that
is,
about
to
be
deprived
of
his
rights
and
tried
by
the
military
when
the
military
has
no
jurisdiction,
then
what
does
he
do?
and,
the
collateral
question,
of
course,
is
whether
or
not
the
individual
must
exhaust
his
remedies
within
the
military
system
before
he
can
even
raise
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
court-martial
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i
think
that
whether
the
civilian
court
has
jurisdiction
at
all
and
when
the
jurisdiction
of
the
civilian
court
arises
depends
upon
whether
or
not
the
military
court
has
jurisdiction.
it
is
my
position
that
if
the
military
court
has
jurisdiction,
then
the
civilian
court
should
stay
out
of
it.
however--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i
say
that--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
yes,
sir.
the
civilian
court--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i
think
that's
not
correct,
although
i
would
say
that,
certainly,
an
individual
always
maintains
his
constitutional
rights
and
always
the
civilian
courts
stand
ready
to
protect
these
constitutional
rights
that
they're
infringed.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i--
in
toth
versus
quarles
which
is--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
that
was
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
and,
in
toth
versus
quarles,
a
man
who,
as
you
recall
it,
been
discharged
in
the
army.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
he
has
retired
his
carrier
and
was
charged
for
murder.
this
court,
applying
the
two-step
test,
found
service-connection
murder
in
the
army,
but
the
individual
is
not
subject
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
therefore,
both
steps
were
not
met.
therefore,
the
military
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
therefore,
we
do
not
require
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
habeas
corpus
a
proper
relief.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
man
was
taken
from
pennsylvania,
i
believe,
back
to
korea.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
to
stand
trial
for
murder
and,
before
the
military
could
proceed
with
the
murder
trial,
the
matter
was
raised
by
habeas
corpus.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i
believe
you're
referring
to
the
facts
in
gusik.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
reid
against
covert
was
a
situation
where
a
military
dependent
was--
stood
accused
of
murdering
her
serviceman
husband.
again,
this
court,
applying
the
two-step
test,
found
that,
okay,
service-connection
for
killing
the
fellow
but
the
first
step
fails
because
the
wife
is
not
subject
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
therefore,
this
court
did
not
require
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
habeas
corpus
as
a
relief.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i
believe
not.
habeas
corpus
was
the
remedy
and
this
court
did
not
require
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
in
reid.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
in
reid,
the
person
was
a
civilian,
the
wife
of
the
serviceman
whom
she
murdered.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
that's
correct.
the
third
case
along
these
lines
is
mcelroy
versus
guagliardo
where
civilian
employees
in
the
military
were
accused
of
stealing
middle-type
property.
again,
the
second
part
of
the
test,
that
is
service-connection,
is
probably
present.
however,
the
people
were
found
not
to
be
subject
to
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
therefore,
exhaustion
was
not
required
and
the
military
could
not
proceed.
habeas
corpus.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
habeas--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
no,
sir.
habeas
corpus
was
the
remedy
as
well.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i
do
have
a
file,
a
case.
dooley
versus
ploger
is
a
fourth
circuit
case.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
sir?
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
dooley
versus
ploger,
i
believe,
is
cited
in
the
government's
brief
and
also
in
the
amici
brief.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
dooley
versus
ploger.
excuse
me.
that
should
be
sedivy
versus
richardson,
and
that
case
was
a
case
involving
the
off
post,
off
duty
possession
of
marijuana.
the
circuit
court
said
that
injunctive
relief
in
that
case
was
not
proper,
and
the
reason
was
that
the
facts
were
not
clearly
presented
to
the
military
court.
so
that
the
military
court
never
had
the
opportunity
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
service-connection
and
that,
i
submit,
is
a
significant
distinction
between
the
sedivy
case
and
the
facts
which
are
now
before
this
court.
the
government--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
the--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
the
cir--
the
district
court
allowed
an
inju--
enjoined
the
court-martial
proceedings.
the
circuit
court
said
the
injunction
was
not
proper
because--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
on
the
merits,
because
the
military
did
not
have
a
chance
to
develop
the
facts
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
that
is
my
understanding
of
the
case.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i'd
like
to
continue
the
line
that
i
had
started--
continue
on
the
two-step
inquiry.
gusik,
i
believe,
is
a
case
that
you're
referring
to,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
in
which
the
person
charged
was
in
the
military.
he
had
already
gone
through
several
trials
for
murder,
and
he
brought
the
action
to
this
court
asking
for
habeas
corpus
and,
at
that
time,
a
new
type
of
relief
was
passed
by
statute
i
believe.
this
court
required
him
to
then
go
back
and
exhaust
all
of
those
remedies.
i
think,
properly
so
because,
applying
the
two-step
inquiry,
one,
the
person
was
subject
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice
and,
two,
the
offenses
he
committed,
murder
of
another
serviceman
in
the
service,
certainly
would
satisfy
the
service-connection.
so,
on
both
points
of
the
two-step
inquiry,
it
points
toward
military
jurisdiction
and
i
think,
in
that
situation,
a
man
should
be
required
to
exhaust
all
of
his
military
remedies.
this
was
basically
the
same
situation
in
noyd
versus
bond
in
which
an
officer
refused
orders
to
teach
pilots
or
train
pilots
for
duty
in
vietnam.
if
you're
applying
the
two-step
inquiry,
we
find
a
captain
in
the
army
on
active
duty
subject
to
the
uniform
code
refusing
an
order,
certainly
a
service-connected
offense.
the
court
properly
held
then
that
the
man
should
be
required
to
exhaust
his
in-military
remedies.
the
court
also
pointed
out
that
in
noyd
versus
bond
there
was
a
particular
question
as
to
a
technical
interpretation
of
a
language
in
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
in
a
footnote
in
noyd
versus
bond,
this
court
cited
toth,
reid,
and
mcelroy,
the
cases
i've
just
discussed,
pointing
out
that
this
court
had
vindicated
the
claim
of
individuals
without
requiring
the
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
for
the
reason
that
this
court
did
not
believe
that
the
expertise
of
the
military
extended
to
the
consideration
of
the
types
of
constitutional
claims
there
presented.
and,
moreover,
it
appeared
especially
unfair
to
require
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
where
the
complainants
raised
substantial
arguments
denying
the
right
of
the
military
to
try
them
at
all,
and
i
believe
that's
where
we
are
here
today
as
well.
let
us--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
sir?
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
he
is
in
the
military,
i
agree,
your
honor.
let
us
apply
the
two-step
inquiry
to
the
facts
before
us
here.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
step
one.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
is
this
man
subject
to
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice?
certainly,
he's
a
captain
on
active
duty
in
the
army.
is
this
offense
sufficiently
service-connected
to
allow
court-martial
jurisdiction?
we
feel
that,
based
on
this
court's
opinion
in
o'callahan
and
relford
applied
to
the
facts
in
this
situation,
this
offense
is
clearly
not
sufficiently
service-connected
to
allow
the
military
to
try
this
man.
now,
we
don't
say
he
shouldn't
be
tried.
what
we
say
is
that
he
should
be
tried
in
a
civilian
court
where
he
has
his
article
3
and
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
let
me
point
out
first,
mr.
justice
marshall,
we're
dealing
with
marijuana
and
not
heroine.
now,
if
captain
councilman
or
an
individual
serviceman
off
post,
off
duty,
out
of
uniform
sells
some
controlled
substance
to
another
person
and
that,
just
by
selling
it
to
another
person,
certainly
he's
committed
a
crime,
but
he
should
be
tried
in
the
civilian
courts.
if
the
person
to
whom
he
sells
it
brings
it--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
then
the
second
man
is
committed--
has
committed
the
service-connected
offense.
the
service-connected
of--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
councilman
has
not
committed
the
service-connected
offense.
councilman
has--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
would
have
to
be
yes,
all
things--
all
other
things
being
equal.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
it
is
a
fact,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
not
in
this
situation.
military
courts
were
fully
open
for
the
trial
of
this
particular
type
of
offense.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
they
did.
the
civilian
authorities
did
turn
him
over
to
the
military
not,
i
think,
because
they
didn't
want
anything
to
do
with
him.
i
don't
know
why
they
did
it,
but
i
merely
say
that
i
know
that
on
many,
many
occasions
the
military
people
are
tried
in
the
civilian
courts
for
just
this
type
of
offense.
it
is
certainly
not
the
practice
of
the
civilian
authorities
to
turn
over
people
to
the
military
simply
because
they're
in
the
military
for
offenses
which
the
military
persons
commit
in
the
civilian
community.
the
civilian
authorities
try
them
regularly.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i
have
no
idea.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
assure
you
the
situation
is
different
at
fort
sill.
it
is
the
rule
that
if
a
serviceman
commits
an
offense--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
the
military
authorities
in
this
particular
case
particularly
requested
that
captain
councilman
be
turned
over
to
them,
and
i
think
that
the
reason
is
this
is
a
captain.
this
is
an
unusual
situation.
there,
at
least
it
was
to
the
military,
that
a
captain
would
be,
having
something
to
do
with
marijuana,
i
think
that
perhaps--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
in--
yes.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
don't
know
why
the
military
thinks
the
way
they
do,
but
i
merely
observed
that
this
is
what
happens.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
i
merely
say
that
this
is--
there
were
three
captains.
there
were
three
captains
involved
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
well,
i
know
that
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the--
sometimes--
mr.
orin
christopher
meyers
the
military.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
