justice

marshall
but
isn't
there
a
difference
that,
here,
the
claim
is
that
they
can't
try
him
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because,
in
this
case,
if
the
captain
had
a
bottle
of
whisky,
nothing
would
have
happened
to
him
but
if
he
had
marijuana
he
would
have
been
prosecuted.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
now
that
he
associates
with
anybody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
not
with
anybody
else
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
that
prevent
the
army
from
moving
in
afterwards?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you've
got
an
agreement
or
something
with
the
law?
justice
thurgood
marshall
after
he's
tried?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
military
could
take
him,
couldn't
they,
before
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
just
waive
that
they
still
have
the
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
possession
of
the
marijuana
at
all
closed,
is
that
an
offense?
do
you
agree
that
that
is
a
military
offense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
possession
of
marijuana,
while
a
member
of
the
military
took
in
any
place?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
where
do
you
get
that
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
we
weren't
dealing
with
a
drug
in
any
of
the
other
cases.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
weren't
dealing
with
drugs
in
any
of
the
other
cases,
were
we?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
weren't
dealing
with
drugs,
but
now
we're
dealing
with
drugs
which
the
military
decided
as
just
that,
unlawful
and
should
be
stopped.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
possession
of
money
is
no
crime,
but
possession
of
marijuana
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course
it's
true,
if
it's
your
own
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
couldn't
make
possession
of
certain
substances
a
crime
and
dope
is
one,
narcotics
is
one,
and
marijuana
is
one.
and,
you
don't
say
that
they
can
make
that
a
crime
to
possess
it,
do
you?
you
only
say
they
can
make
it
a
crime
to
be
caught
in
the
possession
of
it
off
the
base.
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
what
something
else
could
it
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
picks
an
enlisted
man
and
makes
a
deal
to
sell
him
marijuana.
if
he'd
sold
it
to
a
civilian,
you
might
have
a
different
case.
you
might,
but
here
is
an
officer,
knowing
his
rank
and
knowing
the
enlisted
man's
rank,
selling
him
marijuana.
knowing
that
they're
both
military
people
and
knowing
their
rank,
and
you
don't
see
any
problem
with
the
military?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
is
in
the
military.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
one
of
the
other
people
that
councilman
sold
heroine
to
brought
it
back
into
the
post,
would
that
be
military
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
brings
it
back
onto
the
post.
justice
thurgood
marshall
councilman
has?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
councilman
sells
marijuana
at
the
post
on
this
side
of
the
gate,
it's
service-connected.
if
he
sells
it
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate,
it's
not.
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
meyers,
what
about
this
stipulation
that
many
of
the
military
offenders
apprehended
for
drug
sales
and
transfers
to
scads
if
a
civilian
community
have
been
tried
by
the
civilian
authorities
but
some
have
been
tried
by
the
military?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we'll
they're
not
talking
about
this
particular
case,
are
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
general
statement
on
page
24,
“many
of
the
military
offenders
apprehended
for
drug
sales
and
transfers,”
that's
not
talking
about
this
case.
it's
talking
about
the
general
work
of
this
undercover
agent,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
who
made
the
decision
as
to
which
ones
he
gave
to
the
civilian
and
which
one
he
gave
to
the
military?
