justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
were
drawing
the
difference
between
the
drunkenness
and
grass.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you
mentioned
just
a
moment
ago
that
we
might
be
in
a
jurisdiction
where
the
use
of
marijuana
was
not
a
crime.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
do
i
understand
you,
however,
to
say
that
if
the
captain
here
had
gone
off
base,
off
duty,
and
spent
the
evening
in
an
apartment
with
an
enlisted
man
and
they
both
hang
one
on,
that
this
would
not
be
service-connected?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bork,
i
noticed
you
have
consistently
referred
to
drug
use.
isn't
this
a
marijuana
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
there's
some
thinking
that
alcohol
also
does
the
same
thing.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
bork,
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question.
apart
from
this
case,
do
you
know
of
any
civilian
court
precedent
ruling
that
marijuana
possession
is
service-connected?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
do
you
know
of
any--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
any
military
case
holding
that
marijuana
possession
is
not
service-connected?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
many
times
in
your
experience
have
the
civilian
courts
in
your
state
taken
over
a
case
of
drunkenness
of
a
military
person,
public
drunkenness,
many
times?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
don't
they
always
turn
it
over
to
the
military
authorities?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he'd
be
sentenced
for
10
days
to
the
county
jail?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
was
the
order?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
better
not
concede
that
they
could.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they'll
take
away
your
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
do
you
say
that
this
is
a
proper
matter
for
us
as
a
civil
court
when
the
civilian
authorities
turned
your
man
over
to
the
military
authorities?
and,
this
is
a
fact
in
your
case,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
this
doesn't
jive
with
your
co-council's
statement
that
your
local
oklahoma
courts
are
taking
care
of
these
things,
do
you,
day
by
day?
in
my
experience,
at
least
my
impression
anyway,
is
that
the
average
civilian
court
is
eager
to
have
the
military
take
care
of
their
own
problems.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
civilian
authorities
turned
him
over
to
the
military.
they
didn't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
many
times
do
you
think
that
new
port
knows
do
the
virginia
courts
try
public
drunkenness
of
sailors
on
shore
leave?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
to
which
is
it
different
from
fort
sill?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
it's
the
rule,
they
wouldn't
have
turned
him
over
to
the
military
courts
in
this
case.
