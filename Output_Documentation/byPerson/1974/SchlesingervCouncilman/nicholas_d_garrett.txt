mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
i
think
that
myself
and
the
court
has
granted
split
argument
in
this
case,
myself
and
mr.
meyers.
he
will
address
himself
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
i
will
attempt
to
address
myself
to
the
issue
of
service-connection
as
applied
to
o'callahan
and
relford,
the
related
cases.
i
think
that
the
solicitor
general
has
maybe
overstated
this
case
to
one
extent,
in
that
we
will
soon
have,
through
the
use
of
military
agents,
the
servicemen
of
factoring
jurisdiction.
and,
as
justice
blackmun
has
pointed
out,
we
now
have
a
situation
where
the
courts
of
military
appeals
chains
have
uniformly
held
that
possession
is
per
se
service-connected,
and
i
would
suggest
that
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
the
holding
of
either
relford
or
o'callahan
wherein
the
individual
rights
seem
to
be
at
stake
at
o'callahan
where
we
had
the
flagrant
use
of
the
military's
deciding
jurisdiction
was
available,
where
the
only
thing
was
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
service.
there
was
no
other
service-connection
in
an
attempted
raid
off
post,
out
duty,
out
of
uniform.
the
relford
case,
i
think,
tried
to
limit
or
at
least
explain
some
of
the
factors
that
the
military
should
look
at
in
determining
whether
or
not
service-connection
lied,
and
i
think
that
we
find
that
the
military
has,
just
by
some
means,
has
determined
that
marijuana
is
per
se
service-connected
with--
if
you
apply
any
of
the
factors
set
out
either
in
o'callahan
or
in
relford,
you
reach
a
different
conclusion.
the
only
factor
that
the
relford
decision
would
point
to
service-connection
would
be,
in
this
case,
the
councilman
case,
would
be
that
of
a
victim.
and,
i
might
suggest
that,
in
this
case,
i'm
not
sure
that
victim
was
the
kind
of
victim
that
o'callahan
spoke
of
and
that
relford
may
have
expressed
itself
to.
that
is
to
say,
this
victim
is
not
engaged
in
any
military
activity
or
duty.
this
victim
is
an
undercover
agent
who
was
holding
himself
out
by
the
use
of
an
alias
and,
in
the
facts
in
this
thing,
councilman
was
provided
to
a
party
for
the
very
purpose
of
having
met
this
undercover
agent
and
was
held
out
to
be
not
an
undercover
agent,
but
as
a
clerk
typist.
now,
we
would
then
have
a--
i
think,
the
army,
stretching
this
thing,
if
they
stretch
it
much
further
to
the
point
that
they
have
reached
the
fact
that
if
a
government
instrumentality
used,
then
they
may
decide
this
is
jurisdiction
and
i
know
that
the
military
courts
of
appeals
have
uniformly
held
that
it
is
service-connection,
and
i
could
only
suggest
that
after
the
army
has
all
the
facts
before
it,
as
it
did
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
a
32
hearing
which
is
a
hearing
prior
to
the
39
(a)
hearing
where
the
evidence
is
a
induced.
then,
at
the
39
(a)
hearing,
the
government
called
witnesses
and
more
evidence
was
induced
and,
although
the
facts
in
this
case
are
very
limited
because
they
were
reached
by
stipulation,
they're
the
entire
facts
and
there
will
never
be
any
change
in
the
structural
circumstance.
the
government
called
witnesses
of
39
(a)
and
if
they
were
present
at
the
hearing
before
the
district
judge
and
if
there
were
to
be
additional
facts
that
would
be
presented,
i
would
suggest
they
certainly
would
have
called
witness
before
the
district
judge
or
would
have
cause
be
entered
into
another
stipulation
as
they
did
in
this
instance
and
as
attached
to
the
brief
in
this
matter.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
yes,
that
is--
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
no,
i
don't--
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
draw
that
distinction.
what
i'm
saying
is
whether
the
undercover
agent
is
a
lieutenant,
a
captain,
or
a
general
even,
he
is
not
a
“victim”
as
i
think
is
contemplated
by
o'callahan
in
terms
of
the
test
set
out
in
relford.
i
don't
know
if
that
answers
your
question,
but
i--
perhaps
you're
getting
at
the
issue
that
it
is
a
dealing
between
an
officer
and
an
enlisted
man,
and
i
can
only
suggest
that
the
whole
offense,
if
the
service-connection
test
we
had
mean
anything,
we
are
dealing
in
a
society
that
is--
i
mean,
the
factual
situation
are
everything.
both
people
involved,
the
“victim”
and
the--
captain
councilman,
everything
took
place
in
an
area
outside
of
the
reservation
and
he
was
not--
this
agent
was
not
under
the
command
of
captain
councilman,
as
far
as
active
duty
on
base.
captain
councilman
was
going
to
the
school
out
there
and,
of
course,
the
undercover
agent
was
a--
sent
for
the
purpose
of
this.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
yes,
sir.
the--
i
think,
perhaps,
the
court
has
fairly
well-covered
those
items
that--
by
questioning.
those
items
seem
to
me
to
be
important
in
this
case
and
that
is
to
say
that
public
drunkenness
is
a
crime
conjurable
in
the
military
and
in
the
civilian
courts.
and,
yet,
we
do
not
see
soldiers
that
become
drunk
in
the
civilian
communities
dragged
into
the
military
system
and
court-martial.
yet,
we
see
this
happening
on
several
instances
or
in
the
numerous
instances
in
the
case
of
marijuana.
now,
it
seems
to
me
they're
applying
a
different
standard
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
proper
standard
where
they
can
then
ignore
by
a
selective
prosecution
and
ignore
the
criteria
laid
out
by
relford
and
o'callahan.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
i
think
if
the
party
reached
such
proportions
as
according
to
this
where
they
spew
out
into
the
street
and
there
are
off
post,
then
i
think
that
then
we
would
apply
the
relford
test
to
see
if
perhaps,
there,
there
was
service-connection
in
your
fact
situation
and
there
may
be,
in
that
instance,
and
again
depending
on
the
facts,
there
may
be
service-connection
enough
where
they
bring
them
up
on
court-martial.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
no,
it
does
not.
it
is
against
the
law
both
in
oklahoma
and
in
the
military
to
possess
marijuana,
but
i
think,
here,
again
either
in
that
instance
or
your
first
case
involving
public
drunkenness,
i
think
we
need
to
apply
the
test
in
relford.
and,
it
may
be
that,
in
applying
the
test
in
a
public
drunkenness
case,
we
might
have
a
basis
but,
as
far
as
detrimental
effect
in
the
broad
argument
that
the
solicitor
general
is
using
in
terms
of
the
use
of
marijuana
having
a
detrimental
effect,
i'm
sure
that
alcohol
has
more
than
a
detrimental
effect
in
this
instance.
that
is
to
say
that
i
think
probably
alcohol
is
a
more
severe
problem
in
the
army
than
is
marijuana.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
yes,
it's--
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
no,
they
do
not.
we
live
in
a
military
community
and
public
drunk
charges
are
brought
against
soldiers
in
our
town,
i
would
suggest,
at
least
100
over
the
payday
periods
and
they
are
treated
as
any
other
civilian
that'd
be
in
the
city
courts.
and
then,
the
record
is
released
back
to
the
military
that
the
fact
that
he
was
confined
in
our
civilian
courts
but,
of
course,
then
there's
no
jeopardy
attached.
it's
the
only
thing
they
didn't
do
is
make
a
note
of
administratively
in
his
serviceman's
file.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
actually,
it's
a
practical
matter
and
in
accordance
of
$25-50
fine
in
the
civilian
community
for
public
drunkenness.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
fort
sill
community
is
a
lot
in
oklahoma.
it's
a--
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
yes,
it
does,
if
there
is
a
conviction
in
the
civilian
court.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
other
than
administratively,
they
make
a
note
in
a
man's
file.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
no,
sir.
that's
just--
there's
no
way
that
they
can
try
him
again
in
the
military
for
what
took
place,
i
mean
if
he's
tried
in
the
civilian
courts.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
after
he's
tried
or
after
he
pleads
guilty.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
yes,
they
could,
but
they
never
have.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
i
don't
think
that
they--
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
yes,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
they
could
just
come
in
and
take
him
and
try
him.
i
mean,
that's
certainly
an
off
post
offense
without
any
service-connection
unless
we
completely
change
what
we
are.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
what?
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
no,
only
if
it
takes
place
within
the
confines
of
the
base.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
well,
it
seems
to
me
that--
i
mean,
i'm
limiting--
i
can
say,
definitely,
if
he
possesses
marijuana
on
base
that
is
a
military
offense.
then,
it
seems
to
me,
we
have
then
the
next.
if
a
serviceman
possession--
possesses
marijuana
off
base,
out
of
uniform,
off
duty,
then
it
seems
to
me
we
will
have
the
other
side
of
the
coin.
the
military
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
and
then,
i
think,
as
we
apply
the
relford
factors
to
that,
i
think
it
may
be
we
may
reach
whether
they
do
or
don't
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
understand,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
in
the
other
cases,
relford
and
o'callahan?
no,
sir,
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
i'm
not
sure
that
the
military--
i'm
not
sure
that
the
use
of
drugs
or
that
the
military
can
say
that
this
crime,
marijuana,
is
a
different
type
of
crime
than
any
other
crime.
in
other
words,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
ascribe
some
different
status
to
marijuana--
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
yes.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
yes.[laughter]
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
no,
it's
a
crime
to
possess
marijuana
in
the
military.
it's
a
crime
to
possess
marijuana
in
the
civilian
community.
but,
in
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
it
seems
to
me,
or
service-connection,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
has
to
be
something
more
than
mere
possession
off
post
for
the
military
to
now
say
“we
have
jurisdiction.”
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
captain
councilman,
in
this
case,
had
mere
possession
off
post.
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
not
in
terms
of
the
factual
situation
in
this
case.
there
is
not
a
victim
as
a--
as
such.
this
is
an
undercover
agent.
that
is,
holding
him
south--
out
to
be
a
military
man.
if
we
carry
that
argument
further,
it
seems
to
me,
we
then
have,
if
we
have
a
civilian
agent
that
holds
him
out
to--
holds
himself
out
to
be
an
undercover
agent
then
he,
in
that
instance,
would
be--
they
will
find
service-connection.
and,
i
don't
think
that
that's--
that
has--
i
don't--
i
think
that's
the
foggiest
interpretation
of
o'callahan.
the
example
i
gave
is
the
foggiest
interpretation
of
relford
and
o'callahan.
if
the
court
please,
i
see
my
time
has
expired
and
that
i
would
like--
mr.
nicholas
d.
garrett
yes,
your
honor.
