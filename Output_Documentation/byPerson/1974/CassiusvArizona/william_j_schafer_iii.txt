mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
william
schafer,
an
assistant
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
arizona,
and
i
represent
respondent.
before
i
begin
the
discussion
of
the
merits,
i
think
i
should
answer
one
question
that
was
raised
during
mr.
klein's
argument
because
it
did
occur
to
me
and
i
did
attempt
to
do
some
research
to
find
out
the
extent
of
it.
the
question
was
asked
if
section
1580
is
frequently
used.
my
research
has
indicated
that
section
1580
is
not
frequently
used
except
for
one
county
in
the
state
of
arizona,
and
that
is
mr.
klein's
county,
pima
county.
and,
there,
i
have
been
very
reliably
informed
that
it
is
used
almost
every
time
that
it
is
available.
i
believe
there
is
some
kind
of
an
unwritten
policy
that
it
will
be
used
whenever
it
does
apply
in
a
particular
case.
the
other
counties,
however,
do
not
use
it
on
any
kind
of
a
regular
basis
whatsoever.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
your
honor,
i
believe,
in
maricopa
county,
it
is
not
used
on
any
regular
basis
whatsoever.
it
was
a
difficult
time
trying
to
find
that
out.
i
believe
it
has
been
only
used
once
or
twice
really.
and,
that
does
lead
into
another
question,
i
suppose,
that
if
not
been
asked
directly,
has
been
indirectly
and
that
is,
is
this
used
as
part
of
an
ordinary
plea
bargain?
now,
my
experience
has
also
told
me,
in
my
attempt
to
find
out
here,
that
is
not
the
case.
however,
i
could
be
corrected.
there
was
a
plea
bargain
here.
obviously,
from
the
reading
of
the
transcript
in
this
case
from
the
very
beginning,
it
appeared
as
though
there
was
a
plea
bargain
struck
and,
conceivably,
there
could
be
more
to
the
plea
bargain
and
what
we
can
piece
together
here
because,
at
the
very
end,
we
also
find
out
that
mr.
cassius
did
work
with
the
police
and
his
estimation
cleared
up
15
burglary
cases,
i
believe.
so,
conceivably,
there
was
more
to
the
plea
bargain
but,
in
direct
answer
to
your
question
and
perhaps
a
little
of
my
own
there,
i
do
not
believe
that
wherever
this
statute
has
been
used,
it
has
been
used
as
something
to
plea
bargain
to
or
down
from.
other
than
maricopa
and
pima,
i
have
not
been
able
to
find,
i
believe,
any
instance
of
where
this
statute
has
been
used.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
have
to
smile
at
that
because
we
just
argued
that
issue
before
the
arizona
supreme
court
last
week
and,
unfortunately,
the
arizona
supreme
court
refused
to
take
that
issue
but,
by
refusing
to
do
it,
they
indicated
“yes.”
he
has
almost
a
sole
responsibility
within
the
county.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
fourteen,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
no,
we
do
not
and,
if
you
go
beyond
maricopa
and
pima,
the
occasions
for
using
such
a
statute
probably
arise
very
seldom.
it
seems
odd
that
from
the
very
beginning
almost,
the
petitioner
and
respondent,
myself
here,
have
really
been
arguing
essentially
the
same
test
and,
perhaps,
the
same
case
or
at
least
based
upon
the
same
case
since
we
started.
apparently,
we
both
read
those
cases--
that
case.
we
both
read
the
test
and
we
come
out
really
with
different
results,
and
the
test
and
the
case
i
refer
to
are
the
same
evidence
test
which
is
called
by
various
other
names
but
that's
the
one
that
typifies
the
best
to
me.
in
the
blockburger
case,
there
was
a
question
earlier
whether
the
fifth
amendment
was
the
ground
on
which
blockburger
rested,
and
i
could've
answered
that
question
by
saying
i
believe
i
do
not
recall
the
fifth
amendment
being
mentioned
in
that
case.
however,
in--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
can't
say
that,
your
honor,
but
i
do
remember
i
think
the
second
or
third
time
reading
it
that
i
suddenly
found
the
fifth
amendment
was
not
in
that
case.
however,
there
is
a
later
case
which
i
cite
in
the
brief,
gore,
which
does
go
back
to
blockburger
and
it
does
have,
almost
next
to
the
last
page,
a
reference
in
the
majority
opinion
that
if
this
were
not
the
rule
or
if
this
rule
were
to
be
changed,
then
all
sorts
of
cases
would
also
have
to
be
changed
and
the
contention
was
raised
there,
whether
this
was
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
both
do
start
out
with
the
blockburger
test.
we
both
rely
on
that
same
evidence
test.
i
think
we
begin
to
diverge,
however,
on
something
that
came
up
very
early
here
this
afternoon,
and
that
is
as
to
whether
that
test
really
pertains
to
the
actual
evidence
that
was
introduced
to
prove
two
violations
or
whether
what
the
court
was
concerned
with
in
blockburger
and
all
of
the
cases
after
that,
was
as
to
the
elements
of
the
particular
charges
and
not
necessarily
the
actual
proof
that
was
put
in
at
the
trial.
now,
our
contention
is
that
which
either
of
those
two
avenues
is
selected
here,
both
have
been
satisfied
in
this
case
under
the
same
evidence
test.
it
is
difficult
here,
of
course,
because
of
the
guilty
plea
to
go
back
and
determine
actual
proof.
we
cannot
really
do
that.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
the
double
jeopardy
argument,
your
honor?
yes
and
that
gets
back,
i'm
sure,
to
the
enhanced
punishment
analogy.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
was
going
to
say
if
you
mean,
your
honor,
by
the
first
or
the
two
burglary
convictions,
i
separate
the
first
burglary
conviction.
i
will
discuss
and
the
discussion
in
the
brief
really
concerns
only,
and
i
hate
to
call
it,
but
it's
the
second
burglary
and
the
1580.
and,
i
believe
we
can
really
separate
out
that
first
burglary
conviction
and
if
the
question
pertains
to
enhanced
punishment,
i
think
we
can
refer
to
that
second
burglary
and
the
1580
and,
in
a
sense,
the
legislature
could
draft
a
statute.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
no,
your
honor,
i'm
prefacing
my
remarks
to
show
i
thought
the
question
involved
a
guilty
plea
to
that
first
burglary.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
no,
that's
right.
i
hate
to
call
it
first
and
second.
yes,
the
initial
burglary
that
started
this
entire
case--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
charge.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
right.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
and
that,
eventually,
was
eliminated
entirely.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
as
i
say,
we
contend
the--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
no.
mr.
cassius
was
initially
charged
with
a
burglary
and
he
was
released
or.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
approximately
a
month-and-a
half
after
that
occurred,
he
was
then
caught
in
a
building
and
he
was
charged
with
another
burglary.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
and,
at
the
same
time,
he
was
charged
with
what
i'll
call
1580.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
committing
the
burglary
upon
which
he
was
found
caught
in
the
building.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
now,
when
we
get
to
the
plea
bargain
and
to
the--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
he
had
been
charged
with
the
first--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
he
could
have
been,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
he
could
have.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
that's
why
i
was
prefacing
my
remarks
to
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
separate
that
entirely,
and
i've
attempted
sedulously
to
avoid
referring
to
that
in
the
brief
because
i
think
it
makes
it
confusing
and
i
don't
think
it
has
anything
really
to
do
with
the
issues
here.
what
i'm
talking
about
is
that
second
burglary
and
the
1580.
and,
when
i
talk
about
the
blockburger
test
in
the
same
evidence
test,
i
am
talking
about
those
two
particular
offenses,
and
i
would
choose
to
talk
in
this
case
and
i
think
this
is
justified
by
the
case
law
from
this
court
as
to
the
elements
that
are
involved
in
those
crimes,
and
whether
after
considering
those
elements
we
can
truthfully
say
that
those
two
particular
offenses
require
proof
of
different
elements.
therefore,
they
are
two
offenses
and
there
may
be
two
punishments.
now,
mr.
klein
has
said--
he
said
in
his
reply
brief,
which
i
got
shortly
before
i
came
here,
that
there
are
no
cases
and
nowhere
in
the
state
of
arizona
is
there
anything
that
will
tell
us
what
the
elements
of
a
1580
crime
are.
that's
not
quite
right.
there
is
a
statement,
and
i
believe
they
laid
out
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion--
the
arizona
court
of
appeals,
what
one
element
is
and
what
the
other
element
is
of
a
1580
violation.
there
are
no
other
cases
on
1580
in
the
state
of
arizona
that
either
of
us
have
been
able
to
find,
i
believe.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
does
say
that
the
elements
of
that
crime
are
conviction
of
a
felony
and
that
felony
being
committed
while
the
person
was
on
bail
or
or.
and,
i
believe,
over
and
above,
whether
there
are
any
cases
delineating
what
those
elements
are,
the
statute
itself
is
quite
clear
as
to
what
the
elements
are
that
are
required
to
be
proved
when
a
prosecutor
goes
to
court,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
when
you
read
that
statute
it
says
there
has
to
be
a
conviction.
the
petitioner
would
say
that
that
is
not
an
element,
but
that
is
simply
a
standard
of
proof
that
has
been
inserted
into
the
statute
by
the
legislature,
but
there
is
no
indication
of
that
whatsoever,
other
than
perhaps
someone
believing
that.
it
is,
we
contend,
an
element
of
proof
in
that
statute.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
we
are.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
we
are,
your
honor,
and
i
draw
an
analogy
to
enhancement
of
punishment
statute
in
the
brief,
but
i
have
to
admit
and
concede
that
this
creates
a
separate
offense,
whereas,
the
enhancement
of
punishment
statute
would
not.
and,
along
with
my
analogy
of
the
wording
of
the
statute
and
the
elements
contained
within
the
wording
itself,
i
don't
believe
i
can
conscientiously
say
this
does
not
create
a
separate
offense.
it
seems
to
and
it
seems
quite
clear
that
the
arizona
legislature
meant
to
create
a
separate
offense
if
we
go
upon
the
wording
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
separate
from
the
under--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
excuse
me,
are
you
on
page
4
of
the
petition--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
the
appendix.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
it
is.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
that's
the
petitioner's
contention,
your
honor.
our
answer--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
i
was
going
to
say
our
answer
to
that
is
that
the
phrasing
of
the
charge
really
does
not
indicate
the
separateness
of
those
two
offenses.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
what
we
argue,
and
that
is--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
and--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor,
and
there
is
no
indication
in
the
supreme
court
opinion
itself
as
to
what
it
thought
those
elements
would
be.
reading
the
opinion,
however,
i
assume
we
can--
or
i
could
at
least
read
it
and
get
from
it
the
same
two
elements
that
the
court
of
appeals
did,
but
now
i'd
have
to
say
there
is
no
indication.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
i
might
say
it
is
an
additional
crime,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
no,
it
is
not
enhancement.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
when
i
use
the
word
“enhancement,”
as
i
think
as
it's
been
used
here
so
far
this
afternoon,
that
really
gets
back
to
the
ordinary
enhancement
statute
and--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
would
assume
that
that
has
a
great
deal
of
validity
to
it,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
it's
required
under
the
statute.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
no,
it
doesn't
give
me
any
difficulty.
in
fact,
i
use
that
to
verify
my
belief
in
my
argument
that
what
the
legislature
really
had
in
mind
was
to
make
two
offenses
out
of
this,
and
i
can
call
them
separate,
i
can
call
them
distinct,
but
it's
two
offenses.
and,
that's
why
i
say
i
really
cannot
say
that,
to
me,
this
is
an
enhancement
of
punishment
statute
because
that's
not
what
an
enhancement
of
punishment
statute
is.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
he
could
have
received
up
to
15
on
the
burglary
and
up
to
5
on
the
1580
charge.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
the
simple
answer
there
would
be
that
the
statute
simply
requires
it.
there
are
no
two
ways
about
that
under
the
wording
of
the
statute.
it
does
require
it
to
be
consecutive.
now,
there's
something
interesting
there,
however,
in
the
transcript
of
the
sentencing
before
judge
marks.
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
made
by
mr.
cassius'
attorney
is
that
the
judge
take
that
into
consideration,
that
it
has
to
be
consecutive
sentences
and,
of
course,
it
was
known
by
everyone
that
there
could've
been
up
to
15
on
the
burglary
and
5
on
the
1580.
there's
no
indication
by
judge
marks
that
he
actually
did
take
that
into
consideration
in
the
sentence
he
gave,
that
the
only
thing
he
does
indicate
that
he
took
into
consideration
mr.
cassius'
willingness
to
work
with
the
police,
but
that
is
a
possibility
that
that
could
be
taken
into
consideration
and
it
might
and
well
in
a
number
of
cases
by
the
trial
judge.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
yes.
i
don't
want
to
say
that
because
i
know
nothing
about
this
case,
but
it
seems
that
way.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
twenty.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
one
to
two
and
one
two
three,
and
the
one
to
three
was
consecutive.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
and,
on
the
surface
at
least,
it
would
seem
that
that--
yes,
that
that
is
slight,
obviously,
compared
to
what
he
could
have
done
at
the
time.
he,
unfortunately,
does
not
go
any
further
in
the
transcript.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
think
i
can
answer
that.
no,
they
ordinarily
do
not.
however,
every
once
in
a
while
you
will
run
into
one
who
will
in
this
sense
and,
here,
i
expected
something
because
judge
marks
did
go
further
and
say
about
the
boy's
working
with
the
police.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
also--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
i
also
have
to
say
that
that
conclusion
popped
into
my
mind,
but
i
thought
about
it
later
and
perhaps
thought
that
that
might
have
been
due
to
what
mr.
cassius'
attorney
had
said
at
the
time,
but
there's
just
no
indication
that
that's
actually
what
happened.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i'm
sure
it
is.
there
is,
besides
the
same
evidence
test
that
we
have
both
discussed,
there
is
another
test
that
is
referred
to
in
all
of
the
pleadings
in
this
case
and
that's
the
same
transaction
test,
and
it
has
been
mentioned
here,
at
least
inferentially,
a
couple
of
times
this
afternoon.
in
the
brief,
and
i
think
this
is
borne
out
by
a
whole
host
of
cases,
none
of
which
i
can
put
my
finger
on
directly,
but
the
same
transaction
test
has
generally,
we
contend,
been
used
in
those
situations
not
of
double
punishment
but
of
successive
trials.
that
is
not
the
situation
we
have
here,
although
it
does
get
fuzzy
at
times
again
because
we're
concerned
with
the
plea
as
well
as
with
what
went
on
later.
the
same
transaction
test,
however,
although
confused
in
many
cases,
confused
in
the
sense
that
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
they
were
going
for,
does
appear
to
apply
only
in
those
situations
where
there
are--
is
more
than
one
trial,
and
that
is
not
the
situation
we
have
here.
we
have
everything
done
here
at
the
same
time.
it's
conceivable
that
we
could
cut
hairs
and
say
that
the
plea
and
then
the
subsequent
trial
to
the
court
in
the
sense
was
another
trial.
it
was,
but
not--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
that--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
that
generally
is
true,
and
that's
one
reason
why
i
mentioned
the
same
transaction
test
in--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
believe
what
your
honor
is
alluding
to
are--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
that
is
just
about
gore.
and,
in
the
gore
case,
there
were
actually
six
separate
violations.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
essentially,
except
i
would
add
one
more
thing
perhaps
to
that.
i
would
not
quite
say
just
a
single
burglary.
there
was
a
burglary
which
was
the
triggering
mechanism
for
the
second
charge
which
was
15--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
but--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
correct.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
correct.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well,
you--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
i
agree,
your
honor.
that
is
the
wording
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
that's
essentially
what
happened
here,
i
believe.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
well--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
that's
a
possibility.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes,
that's
a
possibility.
the
other
possibility
would
be
that
they
would
do
what
is
analogous
to
enhance
punishment,
at
least
in
arizona.
try
the
one
charge
and
then
turn
around
and
do
the
other
one
at
the
same
time.
it's
deceiving
to
say
at
the
same
time,
but
it
would
be
in
the
same
afternoon.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
but
that
is
the
wording
of
the
statute.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
was
he
convicted
of
the
burglary?
yes,
that'
a
conviction.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
yes.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
your
honor.
mr.
william
j.
schafer,
iii
they
did
in
this
case
and
that
has
never
been
challenged
yet,
within
my
knowledge,
either
in
the
arizona
supreme
court
or
in
any
other
court
that
i'm
aware
of.
i
do
know,
as
i
started
out
by
saying,
that
they
do
this
in
that
one
particular
county
consistently
and,
mr.
klein
can
correct
me
but,
i
am
pretty
sure
that
they
do
it
this
way
consistently
in
pima
county.[attempt
to
laughter]
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
close.
thank
you.
