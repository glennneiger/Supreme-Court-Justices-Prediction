justice
thurgood
marshall
find
in
your
two
trials.
there
was
only
one
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
was
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mentioned
a
minute
ago
all
of
the
difficulties
in
this
as
compared
to
an
enhanced
sentence.
i
don't
see
but
one
and
that
is
he
has
two
convictions.
i
don't
see
anything
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
command
the
results
after
it's
done.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
the
double
jeopardy
now.
i'm
talking
about
the
difference
between
being
convicted
and
given
five
years
because
you
did
it
while
you
were
a
felon,
as
contrast
it
to
two-and-a
half
years
if
you
did
it
without
being
out
on
bail.
and,
you
gave
a
whole
lot
of
sentencing
but
one,
and
that
is
you
get
two
convictions.
that's
the
only--
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
the
legislature
could've
stopped.
justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
the
legislature
say
if
you
commit
a
felony
while
out
on
bail,
you
shall
not
be
eligible
for
parole
ever?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
maybe
your
sentencing
is
within
the
power
of
the
state
legislature.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
only
one
limit,
cruel
and
inhuman.
is
there
another
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
meant
for
this
sentence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
we
all
thought
wide
beyond
the
matter,
but
if--
i
have
a
bit
of
difficulty
with--
they
could
enhance
it.
there's
no
problem
about
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
no
problem
about
that,
and
that
the
only
problem
here
is
that
instead
of
that,
you
get
another
“trail”
on
the
same
offense
and
that's
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
klein,
in
the
case
like
this,
does
the
man
have
bail--
i
mean,
is
bail
revoked
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there--
it's
not
in
this
case,
but
do
they
have
a
statute
on
a
parolee
committing
a
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
curious.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
also
be
charged
with
the
first
burglary?he
had
been.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
it
have
been
three?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
could
he
have
been
convicted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
could
have
had
three
convictions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
no
separate
crime.
this
is
an
additional
crime,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
it's
not
enhancement.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
i'm
in
trouble.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
additional
crime,
but
it's
not
enhancement.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
it
is
enhancement,
it
is.
if
these
two
sentences
would
have
run
concurrently,
you
wouldn't--
nobody
would
be
here.
the
fact
that
you're
here
is
because
the
two
sentences
are
consecutive.
that's
why
we're
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
indeed,
they
have
to
be
under
the
statute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
doesn't
give
you
any
difficulty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
not--
i
don't
know
what
it
means
in
this
case
but,
it
seems
to
me,
i
still
don't
understand
why
a
man
is
so
bad
and
vicious
that
you
have
to
give
him
two
sentences
and
he
ends
up
with
five
years
all
together
for
burglary.
he
could
have
given
him
five
on
the
one,
couldn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
would
the
same
judge
who's
going
to
give
him
a
certain
number
of
years,
why
does
he
have
to
split
it
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
give
him
less.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
couldn't
you
charge--
