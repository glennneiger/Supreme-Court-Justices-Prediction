justice
potter
stewart
mr.
klein,
just
to
go
back
so--
i'm
not
sure
it's
quite
clear
in
my
mind.
there
was
a
plea
bargain.
justice
potter
stewart
under
which
the
first
burglary
charge
was
dismissed.
there
was
a
guilty
plea
to
the
second
burglary
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
did
the
bargain
have
to
say,
if
anything,
about
the
1580
charge?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
was
no--
so,
what
was
done
was
exactly
in
accord
with
the
bargain?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
used
in
pima
county
regularly
the
way
it
was
here
to
make
two
separate
offenses
and
in
this
case
with
consecutive
sentences
or
is
it
just
used
to
make
one
conviction
on
an
aggravated
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the--
there
was
a
second
burglary
conviction
and
that
he
was
convicted
of
burglary
while
on
bail
on
a
felony
charge.
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
two
burglary
convictions.
one
on
the
guilty
plea
and
one
on
the
judge's
finding
on
agreed
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
for
committing
a
burglary
while
he
was
on
bail
on
a
felony
charge.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
whether
or
not
he
was
convicted
on
the
first
charge,
from
which
he
was
released
on
his
or,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issues
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact,
it's
quite
a
bad
pleading,
isn't
it,
because,
if
you
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute
on
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
offense
doesn't
occur
until
after
the
conviction
on
the
first
burglary?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
they
can't
really
be
charged
that
way
because
it
would--
i
mean,
if
you
think
about
accurate
and
not
just
the
pleading.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
second
offense
under--
there
is
no
offense
under
1580
until
there's
a
conviction
of
the
felony.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
the
statute
says
very
clearly,
on
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
this
indictment--
this
complaint,
rather,
is--
couldn't
be
right
because
they
couldn't
charge
him
under
count
two
until
he'd
been
convicted
under
count
one,
if
you
take
the
statute's
literal
words
to
mean
what
they
say.
justice
potter
stewart
with
all
these--
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
with
all
respect,
i
don't
understand
this
at
all,
if
we're
going
to
take
the
statute
as
it's
read.
you
can't
have
the--
an
offense
under
1580
until
and
after
there's
a
conviction
on
the
first
burglary.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can't
try
them
all
together.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
take
the
words
of--
if
you
look
at
page
3
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
see
what
that
statute
says,
it
says
a
person
who
is
convicted
of
committing
any
felony
offense
while
released
on
bail.
so,
how
could
you
have
a
violation
of
this
1580
until
and
unless
there
was
a
conviction?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
does
that
make
sense?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
very
odd
way
to--
justice
potter
stewart
a
component
of
the
offense
is
a
conviction,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
they
did
in
this
case,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
a
jury
verdict
of
guilty
is
not
an
element
conviction.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
lot
that
could
happen
between--
justice
potter
stewart
that
verdict
and
a
judicial
conviction.
