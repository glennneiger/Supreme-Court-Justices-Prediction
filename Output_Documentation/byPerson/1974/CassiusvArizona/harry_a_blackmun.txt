justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
know
why?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
klein,
is--
there
are
three
crimes,
aren't
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
klein,
do
you
know
is
this
statute
frequently
used
by
the
prosecution
in
arizona?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
klein,
i
suppose
the
only
additional
element
under
your
statutory
crime
is
being
out
on
bail
or
an
rpr.
that
in
itself
isn't
criminal,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
there
may
be
no
sense
in
it,
but
i
guess
what
i'm
asking
is
whether
the
difference
between
burglary
and
the
offense
under
the
special
statute
is
only
an
element
which
in
itself
isn't
criminal.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
even
anything
else,
not
even
the
word
“constitution”
appears,
does
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
thought
justice
stewart's
inquiry
of
you
was
that
you
can't
even
indict
for
a
1580
until
you
have
the
first
conviction.
i
take
it,
you
can
under
arizona
practice.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but,
mr.
klein,
isn't
the
fact
that
under
this
very
charge,
had
this
first
appellant
gone
to
the
jury,
could
the
court--
trial
judge
have
instructed
the
jury
“you
must
find
him
guilty
first
of
the
burglary
before
you
address
the
second
count.
if
you
find
him
guilty
of
the
burglary,
you
may
then
address
the
second
count
and
find
him
guilty
of
that.”
