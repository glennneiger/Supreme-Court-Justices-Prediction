justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
was
the
proof
at
the
trial
of
this
1580
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
klein,
we
keep
peppering
you
with
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
i
understand
your
double
jeopardy
approach.
suppose
arizona,
however,
instead
of
having
this
statute
which
seems
to
me
to
be
a
fairly
unusual
one,
provided
that
the
punishment
for
burglary
shall
be
x-years,
but
the
punishment
for
burglary
committed
while
on
an
rpr
or
after
one
being
charged
with
a
felony
is
y-years,
y
being
greater
than
x.
anything
unconstitutional
about
that,
drawing
the
distinction
in
punishment
as
distinguished
from
making
under
separate
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
the
same
result
would
be
accomplished,
as
the
state
claim
is
accomplished
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
klein,
do
you
think
blockburger
is
consistent
with
your
double
jeopardy
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
still
has
the
conviction
though
under
1580.
that's
the
problem
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sorry,
it
wasn't
in
the
first
but
i
think
the
first
burglary
charge
was
dismissed.
there
was
no
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
referred
to
the
first
burglary
conviction.
there's
only
one
burglary
conviction,
isn't
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
charge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
dismissed
afterwards.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
plea
bargain.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then,
i
take
it,
you
are
arguing
that
these
are
separate
and
distinct
crimes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
this
is
not
an
enhancement
of
punishment
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
it
separate
or
two?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
the
second,
at
least
looking
at
page
4,
the
criminal
complaint,
the
first
count,
he
committed
a
burglary.
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
on
that.
the
second
one
is
he
also
committed
a
burglary
and
was
sentenced
on
that,
the
same
burglary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
page
4
of
the
appendix.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
was
charged.
as
raised,
i
believe,
the
second
count
is
that
he
committed
a
burglary
while
on
bond
and
the
first
one
is
he
committed
a
burglary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it's
the
same
burglary
referred
to
in
both.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
he's
convicted
twice
of
the
same
burglary.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
as
phrased,
where
the
charge
reads.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
a
single-sale
of
narcotics.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
violates
three,
four,
five
statutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
separate
counts
for
the
violation
under
each
statute.
you
try
them
all
together.
he's
convicted
on
them
all.
you
can
impose
consecutive
sentences.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
with
gore.
that's
what
blockburger
was,
and
i
gather
your
argument
here
really
is
there's
a
single
burglary
but
it
violated
two
statutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
were
disposed
of
in
the
same
proceeding,
therefore,
no
double
jeopardy
violation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
couldn't
it
be
disposed
as
it
had
gone
to
trial?
couldn't
the--
a
jury
had
been
tried--
charged?
if
you
find
him
guilty
of
a
burglary,
then
you
also
may
find
him
guilty
of
the
violation
of
1580.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
a
single
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
draw
no
distinction
between
the
result
of
a
plea
of
guilty
and
any
other
type
of
conviction,
do
you?
