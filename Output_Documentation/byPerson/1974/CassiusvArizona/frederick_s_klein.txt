mr.
frederick
s.
klein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
this
case
involves
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
an
arizona
statute,
title
13
of
the
arizona
revised
statute
section
1580,
which
provides
“a
person
who
is
convicted
of
committing
any
felony
offense,
whether
federal
or
state,
which
felony
offense
is
committed
while
such
person
is
released
on
bail
or
on
his
own
recognizance
on
a
separate
felony
charge
is
guilty
of
the
offense
of
committing
a
felony
while
released
on
bail
or
on
his
own
recognizance
and,
upon
conviction
of
such
crime,
shall
be
punished
by
imprisonment
in
the
state
prison
for
not
more
than
five
years.
such
penalty
shall
be
in
addition
to
and
shall
be
served
consecutively
to
any
penalty
imposed
for
the
offense
committed
while
released
on
bail
or
on
his
own
recognizance.
for
a
violation
of
this
statute
to
take
place
three
events
must
occur.
first,
a
defendant
must
be
charged
with
a
felony,
which
i
would
call
charge
a,
and
must
be
released
on
that
charge.
second,
the
defendant
must
subsequently
be
charged
with
another
felony,
which
i'd
call
charge
b,
which
is
alleged
to
have
occurred
while
he
was
released
on
charge
a.
and,
thirdly,
the
defendant
must
be
convicted
of
charge
b.
he
need
not
be
convicted
of
charge
a
and,
in
fact,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
the
result
on
charge
a
is
as
far
as
section
1580
is
concerned.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner,
michael
cassius,
was
arrested
and
charged
with
burglary
of
a
motor
vehicle.
he
was
released
on
that
charge
and
he
was
subsequently
arrested
at
the
scene
on
an
apparent
burglary
of
a
business
establishment.
he
was
charged
with
a
second
charge
of
burglary
and
also
with
a
charge
of
committing
a
felony
while
released
on
recognizance
under
section
1580.
on
january
4,
1973,
a
hearing
was
held
in
the
superior
court.
at
which
time,
the
defendant
pleaded
guilty
to
the
second
burglary
charge.
the
first
burglary
charge
was
dismissed.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
why
it
was
dismissed?
it
was
dismissed
as
part
of
an
agreement
to
plead
to
the
second
burglary
charge.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
if
i--
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
i
realize
that
the
fact
that
it
was
disposed
of
in
this
way,
of
course,
denies
us
the
opportunity
to
look
at
the
substance
of
the
first
charge,
but
it
was
dismissed
as
part
of
the
a
plea
bargain,
and
the--
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and,
the
charge
under
section
1580
was
then
submitted
to
the
court
for
trial,
and
the
defendant
was
found
guilty
on
that
charge.
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
a
term
of
one
to
two
years
imprisonment
on
the
burglary
charge.
he
was
sentenced
to
a
consecutive
term
of
one
to
three
years
on
the
section
1580
charge.
the--
on
appeal,
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
held
that
section
1580,
as
applied
to
this
petitioner,
violated
his
rights
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
but
the
arizona
supreme
court
vacated
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
held
that
section
1580
did
not--
neither
constituted
double
jeopardy,
nor
denied
equal
protection.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that's
correct.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
the--
well,
the
bargain
provided
that
the
defendant
was
not
going
to
plead
guilty
to
the
1580
charge,
and
the
trial
court
was
advised
that
the
reason
for
this
was
that
the
defendant
wished
to
reserve
his
right
to
challenge
that
statute
on
appeal.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
you're
welcome.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
in
the
experience
of
our
office,
it
is
frequently
used.
however,
our
experience
is
also
that,
very
often,
this
charge
is
dismissed
as
part
of
plea
bargains
but
it--
i'm
aware
that
there
are
a
number
of
individuals
in
the
state
prison
serving
sentences
under
this
charge.
we
have
presented
two
questions
to
this
court.
the
first
is
that
section
1580
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
through
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
let
me
turn
that
question
around
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice.
part
of
our
argument
with
reference
to
our
equal
protection
claim
is
that
the
statute,
because
it,
in
a
sense,
presumes
a
defendant
guilty
of
the
first
charge
even
though
it
need
not
be
proven,
contravenes
the
presumption
of
innocence.
and,
if
the
statute
were
drafted,
so
to
say,
that
the
state
must
prove
a
conviction
of
both
the
first
and
the
second
charge,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
would
be
no
infringement
upon
the
presumption
of
innocence,
but
i'm
not
sure
the
statute
as
drafted
does
not
require
our
conviction
of
the
first
charge
and
this
defendant
was,
in
fact,
not
convicted
in
the
first
charge.
i
don't
know,
does
that
answer
your
question?
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that's
a
good
question,
your
honor.
neither
of
the
arizona
courts
which
wrote
an
opinion
in
this
case
indicated
what
the
elements
of
a
1580
charge
were.
in
fact,
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
that
the
charges
of
which
this
defendant
was
convicted,
burglary
and
1580,
had
no
elements
in
common.
now,
the
state
in
its
petition--
in
its
brief
has
argued
that
there
are
two
elements.
they
say
that,
first
of
all,
there
is
an
element
of
conviction
of
a
felony
and,
secondly,
that
there
is
an
element
of
commission
while
the
defendant
is
released
on
a
felony
charge.
and,
i
submit
that
that
statement
is
also
ambiguous
in
terms
of
determining
what
the
elements
are.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
the
proof
was
that
the
court
was
asked
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
burglary
was
a
felony
and
that
the
defendant
had
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
burglary,
and
it
was
stipulated
that
the
defendant
had
been
charged
previously
and
had
been
released
on
that
charge
and
had
remained
released
during
the
period
of
time
in
which
the
second
burglary
charge
was
alleged
to
have
occurred.
and,
the
only
reason
there
was
need
for
that
stipulation
was
that
the
justice
of
the
peace
who
released
the
defendant
had
not
issued
an
order
or
entered
one
into
the
record,
and
so
the
court
couldn't
take
judicial
notice
about
it.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
we
regard
him
having
been
at
large
by
virtue
of
a
state
constitutional
right
which
also
receives
federal
constitutional
protection,
although
i
submit
that
it's
unclear
what
the
parameters
of
that
protection
are.
this
court
has
said,
for
example,
that
the
presumption
of
innocence
would
be
meaningless
if
defendants
could
not
be
released
prior
to
their
trial
because
if
they
could
not,
they
would
be
punished
before
they
were
tried.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
that's
certainly
what
the
eighth
amendment
protection
provides,
your
honor.
i
would
submit,
though,
that
the
fact
that
a
right
to
release
is
not
absolute
does
not
make
it
any
less
fundamental.
even
the
right
to
free
speech,
which
is
one
of
the
most
nearly
absolute
rights,
is
not
absolute.
you
can't
yell
“fire!”
in
a
crowded
theater.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
be
my
guest,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
if
i
understand
your
question,
it
is
if
the
statute
had
been
drafted
as
a
punishment
enhancement
statute
rather
than
as
a
separate
crime,
would
this
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
my
answer
would
be
no,
although
there
might
still
be
some
problems
under
our
equal
protection
argument.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
not
exactly,
your
honor.
well,
the
same
result
that
the
state
seeks
would
be
accomplished,
but
the
effects
upon
the
defendant
would
be
different.
for
example,
because
it
is
charged
as
a
separate
offense,
the
defendant
is
subject
to
receive
his
penalties.
that
is,
for
his
one
criminal
act,
it
goes
down
on
the
record
as
two
offenses
committed
one
after
the
other,
and
he
is
not
entitled
to
the
advantageous
good
time
credits
that
he
would
be
entitled
to,
were
he
a
first
offender.
his
parole
eligibility
date
is--
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
yes,
but
there
are
additional
consequences,
your
honor.
the
fact
that
it
is
a
separate
offense
and
not
a
punishment
enhancement
statute
gives
the
prosecutor
opportunities
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
designed
to
prevent.
for
example,
there's
no
need
to
prosecute
1580
at
the
same
time
as
the
first
felony
offense.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
but,
the
difference
is
that
this--
our
argument
is
that
this
is
the
same
offense,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the--
that
a
punishment
enhancement
statute,
while
it
would
serve
the
same
objectives
that
the
state
claims
to
have,
would
not
have
precisely
the
same
consequences
on
the
defendant,
and
punishment
enhancement
statute
would
not--
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
i
think
that
a
punishment
enhancement
statute
could
be
drafted
so
as
not
to
come
within
the
equal
protection
arguments
that
we
raise.
for
example,
as
i
say,
the
infringement
upon
the
presumption
of
innocence
could
be
done
away
with
by
requiring
a
conviction
on
the
first
as
well
as
the
second
offense.
i
think
that
a
punishment
enhancement
provision
could
be
drafted
to
serve
the
same
objectives
without
violating
either
of
the
guarantees
that
we
argue
are--
were
violated
in
this
case.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i--
the
court
has
devised
a
number
of
tests
for
determining
whether
two
offenses
are
the
same,
and
the
blockburger
test
is
probably
the
narrowest
or
the
most
restrictive
of
these
tests,
but
i
believe
that
our
case
meets
that
test
as
well.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
my
recollection
is
that
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
then
i
stand
corrected,
your
honor.
i
do
know
that
in
subsequent
cases
blockburger
has
been
relied
upon
as
a
test
for
double
jeopardy.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
the
defendant
pleaded
guilty
to
the
second
burglary.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
no,
and
one
of
the--
one
of
our
objections
to
the
way
1580
is
drafted
is
that
it
only
really
requires
a
determination
rather--
whether
a
defendant
falls
within
a
particular
class
to
find
by
the
statute.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
commit--
pleaded
guilty
to
the
second
burglary.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
i
would
say
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
yes,
because
the--
and
it
was
obvious
in
the
context
that
the
defendant's
counsel
believed
that
the
statute
itself
was
subject
to
challenge.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
the
question.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
you're
speaking
in
terms
of
our
double
jeopardy
argument.
yes,
we
do
concede
that
that
would
be
different
from
providing
for
a
subsequent
prosecution
for
that
crime.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
it's
my
understanding,
your
honor,
that
the
protection
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
which
derives
from
the
common
law
plea
of
former
conviction,
does
not
require
two
trials.
it
requires
a
trial
following
a
conviction,
and
that
conviction
may
be
on
the
guilty
plea.
in
this
case,
there
was
as
guilty
plea
entered,
and
then
the
defendant
was
tried,
that
is
as
much
as
you
can
have
a
trial
under
1580,
on
the
1580
charge.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
i
think
that
depends
upon
whether
you
interpret
the
statute
as
indicating
separate
elements
or
whether
you
consider
the
bill
of
attainder.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
has
discretion
whether
or
not
to
charge
1580
and
when
to
charge
it.
if
the
prosecutor,
for
example--
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
designed
to
protect
certain
interests.
one
of
those
interests--
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
you
have
two
convictions
and
the
fact
that
you
have
two
convictions
gives
rise
to
a
number
of
collateral
consequences.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
but,
in
addition
to
those--
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that's
an
issue
i
would
rather
not
address
myself
to
because
we
have
some
cases
like
that
at
the
present
time,
but--
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
within
a
certain
limit,
surely.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
there
are
limitations
placed
upon
it
by
the
due
process
clause
certainly.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
on
the
matter
of
imposition
of
sentence.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
yes,
but
in
that,
your
honor,
for
example,
if
the
prosecutor
were
dissatisfied
with
the
sentence
that
mr.
cassius
received
on
his
burglary
plea
and
supposing
that
he
had
not,
at
that
time,
chosen
to
prosecute
under
1580,
he
could
then
prosecute
under
1580
in
order
to
bring
the
punishment
more
in
the
line
of
his
view.
now,
that's
analogous
with
the
protection
double
jeopardy
provides
in
cases
of
former
acquittal
where
we
say
a
prosecutor
should
not
be
allowed
to
increase
his
chances
of
obtaining
the
conviction
by
re-prosecuting
for
the
same
offense.
here,
he
is
trying
to
increase
his
chances
of
getting
the
sentence
he
believes
to
be
appropriate
by
being
allowed
to
re-prosecute
following
a
conviction.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
to
be
out
on
bail
is
not
a
crime.
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question
though.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that
would
be
my
interpretation
of
it,
your
honor,
that
it
is
an
element,
if
you
can
call
it
that,
which
is
not
what
we
have
traditionally
regarded
as
an
element
of
criminal
responsibility.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
at
least
that
is,
as
i
read
it,
the
arizona
supreme
court's
interpretation
of
that
statute.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
i
would
agree
that
you're
under
additional
constraints,
but
i
would
not
agree
that
the
duty
to
obey
the
law
is
an
additional
constraint.
that's
the
same
duty
whether
you're
released
on
a
charge
or
not.
everyone
has
that
same
duty.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
in
the
sense
that
the
conditions
of
his
bail
can
be
established
in
the
same
way,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
quite
agree,
but
the
reason
that
a
condition
of
good
behavior
is
put
into
bail
agreements
is
precisely
so
that
the
court,
if
it
has
reason
to
believe
that
an
individual
has
not
been
behaving
himself
while
released,
so
that
it
can
re-examine
the
conditions
of
his
release.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
in
a
different
position,
but
not
with
regard
to
his
duty
to
obey
the
law.
he
has
the
same
duty.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
well,
a
person
who
commits
a
crime
is
subject
to
the
loss
of
his
liberty.
that's
true
whether
you're
released
or
not.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
section
1580
does
not
provide
for
that,
your
honor.
there
are
provisions
in
arizona
law
for
revocation

not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
if
i
may,
i
think
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
remaining.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
very
briefly,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
the
statement
to
which
mr.
schafer
was
referring
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
or
statements,
i
believe,
appear
on
pages
34
and
35
of
the
appendix,
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
read
this
statement
as
in
accord
with
the
decision
of
arizona
supreme
court.
the
statement
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
that
the
state
argues
that
the
elements
of
13-1580
are
different,
i.e.
one,
conviction
of
a
felony
and,
two,
such
felony
having
been
convict--
committed
during
a
designated
period.
we
f--
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
this
is
page
35
of
the
appendix,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
we
find
such
argument
specious.
the
conviction
element
is
a
judicial
act,
not
appellant's,
leaving
only
the
burglary
as
the
act
of
appellant.
and,
the
arizona
supreme
court,
while
not
stating
what
the
elements
of
1580
were,
said
that
the--
there
were
no
elements
in
common
between
burglary
and
1580.
now,
i
think
there
is
a
point
of
agreement
between
counsels
in
that
the
statute
requires
proof
of
a
conviction
before
one
can
be
found
guilty
of
1580.
our
contention
is
that
that
is
a
requisite
form
of
proof
of
the
element
of
commission.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
if
the
jury
had
found
the
defendant
guilty,
it
would
still
be
within
the
court's
power
to
overturn
that
verdict
and,
therefore,
it
would
not
be
a
conviction.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that
would
be--
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that
would
be
my
feeling.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
i
don't
believe
they
are,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
they
would
be
in
accord
with
my
view
point
that
a
conviction
must
be
proven,
but
that
the
element
involved--
that
conviction
is
merely
a
form
of
proof
of
commission.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
your
honors.
mr.
frederick
s.
klein
that's
correct,
your
honor.
