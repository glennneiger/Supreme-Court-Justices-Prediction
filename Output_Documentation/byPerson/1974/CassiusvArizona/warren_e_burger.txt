chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
cassius
against
arizona,
74-5140.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
whether
the
state
had--
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
state
concluded
it
was
satisfied
with
one
guilty
plea
that
would
have
a
substantial
sentence
even
though
the
man
had
apparently
committed
two
criminal
acts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apparently,
with
emphasis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
your
position
on
this
issue
if
he
had
entered
a
guilty
plea
to
the
first
charge,
been
sentenced,
then
a
guilty
plea
to
the
subsequent
charges?
would
you
think
that
would
be
waivered
or
what
could
be
your
view?
you'd
made
the
point
that
you
haven't
had
the
chance
to
test
out,
which
is
correct.
the
truth
of
the
first
charge,
except
as
there
is
some
passive
admission
involved
in
the
so-called
bargain
negotiation,
but
if
he
had
been
found
guilty
and
had
his
day
in
court
on
that
first
one,
either
by
plea
or
by
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
regard
your
client
as
having
been
free
and
at
large
by
virtue
of
a
constitutional
right
or
by
virtue
of
a
statutory
provision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
we'd
all
agree
that
the
federal
constitution
doesn't
guarantee
the
right
to
be
released
on
bail,
but
merely
that
they
may
not
be
regard
to
furnish
excessive
bail.
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
reserved
this
issue
in--
on
your
guilty
plea?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
said
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
state
supreme
courts
and
perhaps
some
courts
of
appeal
have
held
that
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
about
defining
a
certain
crimes
as
more
serious
and
in
subject
to
greater
punishment
when
they're
committed,
for
example,
within
a
prison,
an
assault
on
a
prison
guard,
an
assault
on
a
fellow
prisoner,
a
killing
of
a
prison
guard.
i
take
it,
concede
that
a
statute
couldn't
be
drawn
which
would
impose
the
greater
punishment
for
the
commission
of
a
crime
while
on
bail
without
regard
to
whether
that
issue
of
fact
on
the
first
crime,
while
on--
for
which
he
was
bailed,
was
ever
tried
out.
the
question
may
be
a
little
confusing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
concede
that
a
greater
punishment
could
be
imposed
constitutionally
for
committing
a
crime
while
on
bail
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
there's
even
a
crime--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may.
mr.
klein,
you
may
surely.
mr.
schafer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
counties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
you
don't
have
80
or
90
different
prosecution
policies.
some
states
do
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you'd
agree,
perhaps
your
friend
might
even
agree,
that
if
there'd
been
a
guilty
plea
to
both
burglaries
but
with
an
agreement
that
contemplated
the
aggregate
punishment
the
same
as
was
actually
entered
here,
that
that
would
be
eliminated
to
deal
with
his
argument.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
presumption
of
innocence
argument
which
he
separated
from
his
double
jeopardy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
the
first
burglary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
gave
a
very
long
portion
of
the
allowable
penalty,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
maximum
penalty
was
what
all
together?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
and
what
did
they
impose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
he's
got
a
two-year
minimum
as
against
a
possible
20-year
maximum.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
judges
in
arizona
ordinarily
give
some
explanation
about
their
sentencing
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
implication
i
drew
from
that
when
i
saw
that
reference
was
that
this
is
precisely
a
mitigating
factor
in
his
imposition
of
the
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
comply
with
the
statute
which
require
the
separate
penalty
for
each
one,
i
take
it,
he
would
have
had
the
power
to
suspend
one
of
the
sentences,
wouldn't
he,
under
arizona
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it's
easier
for
one
of
us
up
here
to
attribute
thought
process
as
to
a
state
court
judge
than
it
is
for
you
when
you
have
to
continue
working
with
him.[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
can't
reach
count
2
or
the
second
question
under
1580until
they
have
crossed
the
bride
on
count
1,
that
is
did
he
perform
the
act
of
the
burglary.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
found
that
he
did
the
act
which
points
to
a
conviction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
schafer.
you
have
nothing
to
do
more.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
klein?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
klein.
you
appeared
here
at
our
request
by
the
appointment
of
this
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
thank
you
for
your
assistance
to
the
court
and,
of
course,
your
assistance
to
your
own
client.
thank
you,
mr.
attorney
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
74-5140,
cassius
against
arizona,
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
powell
dissents.
mr.
justice
douglas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision.
