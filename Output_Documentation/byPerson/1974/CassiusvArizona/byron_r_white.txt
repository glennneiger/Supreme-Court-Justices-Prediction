justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
state
legislative
could--
legislatively
could
attach
all
those
consequences
to
a
single
crime
of
committing
burglary
while
on
bail
just
like
it
attaches
a
higher
penalty,
perhaps,
and
then--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that
that
argument
is
a--
that
argument
would
go
to
cases
where
the--
where
anyone
act
is
broken
up
into
several
crimes,
and
they're
all
prosecuted
at
once.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
would
tell
the
double
jeopardy
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
you
think
you
still
have
an
arguable
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
on
your
idea
that
these
are
different
offenses,
the
state
could
try
the
burglary
first
and
the
burglary
while
out
on
bail
later.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
transaction
test
would
say
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
there
are
some
cases
in
the
court,
including
perhaps
blockburger
or
any
of
it
or
gore,
that
would
say
that
even
if
that's
the
same
offenses,
the
fact
that
you're
imposing
two
punishments
does
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
a
single
act
violates
three
different
statutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
impose
punishments.
you
try
them
all
the
same
time
and
punish--
and
impose
three
punishments
for
the
identical
act.
