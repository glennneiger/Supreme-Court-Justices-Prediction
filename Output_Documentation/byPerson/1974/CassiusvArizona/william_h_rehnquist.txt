justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
elements
does
the
state
have
to
prove,
mr.
klein,
in
1580?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
blockburger's
said
to
rest
by
the
court
on
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
the--
justice
sutherland
relied
on
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
blockburger?
he
didn't
even
mention
it,
so
far
as
i
know.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
about
what
i
guess
are
basically
the
facts.
in
the
proceedings
before
judge
marks
resolving
doubts
of
facts
and
so
forth
in
favor
of
the
prevailing
party
as
we
do
here,
can
it
fairly
be
said
that
judge
marks
found
that
your
client
had
committed
the
second
burglary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
pleaded
guilty
to
the
second
burglary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
then
the--
were
there
any
contested
issues
of
fact
tried
before
the
trial
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
only
factual
element
of
the
crime
is
that
at
least
the
second
burglary
or
the
commission
of
the
crime
while
on
bail
that
your
client
plead
guilty
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
was
conceded
that
he
did
it
while
on
bail?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
there
really
weren't
any
factual
issues
and
dispute
in
the
1580
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet,
the
legislature
here
has
made
it
an
element
of
criminal
responsibility.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
subject
to
kind
of
addition
constraints
while
on
bail.
the
“don't
commit
any
crimes,”
etcetera,
that
the
ordinary
person
is
not
subject
to
it
in
terms
of
a
judicial
injunction
in
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
your
bail
can
be
revoked
if
you
don't
obey
the
law
when
you're
on
bail,
and
an
ordinary
citizen,
if
he
doesn't
obey
the
law,
has
to
go
through
a
full
criminal
proceeding
because
his
liberty
could
be
restrained.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
to
that
extent,
he's
in
a
different
spot
than
the
person
who
has
never
been
arraigned
in
the
first
place.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
different
consequences
attached
to
a
breach.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
arizona
is
a
state,
isn't
it,
mr.
schafer,
where
the
county
attorney
of
the
individual
county
has
the
primary
discretion
to
determine
prosecution
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schafer,
when
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
vacated
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
did
it
indicate
any
doubt
as
to
the
construction
that
had
been
placed
on
the
statutory
language
by
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
couldn't
the
conviction
occur
at
his
trial
for
the
offense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
yet,
the
arizona
court
of
appeals
is
clearly
in
accord
with
justice
brennan's
comment,
isn't
it?
