justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
arey,
as
i
understand
one
of
your
opponent's
contention
is
that
taking
the
maine
court
at
its
word
as
to
--
in
your
explanation
of
how
the
criminal
statute
is
to
be
construed,
and
perhaps
conceding
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
if
that
had
taken
place
in
this
case,
there'd
be
no
violation
of
winship.
that
the
trial
judge
did
charge
the
jury
at
that
place
at
i
guess
page
40
of
the
appendix
where
he
says
“the
words
malice
aforethought
are
most
important
because
malice
aforethought
is
an
essential
and
indispensable
element
of
the
crime
of
murder.”
is
that
an
inconsistency
between
the
trial
judge's
treatment
of
the
case
and
the
supreme
court
of
maine's
treatment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
they
given
three
forms
of
verdict,
guilty
of
murder,
guilty
of
manslaughter
and
not
guilty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
then
in
effect,
this
element
is
like
the
defensive
insanity
in
leland
against
oregon
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
don't
almost
--
don't
the
large
majority
of
the
states
when
you're
talking
not
about
mitigation
but
about
self-defense
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
prove
justification
on
that
sense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
courts
you
won
in
below
had
really
repudiated
that
type
of
analysis
now,
haven't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
turn
of
the
chair,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
read
anything
in
the
remand
at
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
there
is
something
to
what
your
opposing
counsel
says
that
you
don't
simply
seize
one
instruction
out
of
context
and
the
questions
whether
the
instructions
as
a
whole
fairly
charged
the
jury.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
exception
taken?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you're
saying
that
it's
conflicting
with
a
charge
that
says
one
thing
at
one
point
and
another
thing
at
another
point.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
isn't
there
some
obligation
on
a
defendant
to
accept
if
he
feels
that
way
about
the
charge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
in
leland
against
oregon,
it's
a
difference
between
guilty
and
not
guilty.
how
do
you
distinguish
leland?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
many
if
not
a
majority
of
the
states
put
the
burden
of
self
defense
in
a
murder
case
on
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
those
rules
are
all
invalidated
by
winship?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
self-defense
the
type
of
thing
just
like
you
say
insanity
is
that
the
defendant
is
much
more
capable
of
coming
up
with
evidence
of
than
the
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
the
victim
isn't
there
to
testify.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
in
your
view,
a
defendant
in
every
criminal
case
is
entitled
to
a
charge
from
the
trial
judge
that
unless
the
state
has
proved
the
absence
of
self-defense
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
he's
entitled
to
a
judgment
of
acquittal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
don't
treat
self-defense
exactly
as
you
dot
the
proof
of
the
killing
where
presumably
you
don't
say
that
you
say
the
state
has
to
prove
the
evidence
of
the
killing
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
not
if
there's
some
evidence
of
a
killing
the
state
has
to
go
ahead
and
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
