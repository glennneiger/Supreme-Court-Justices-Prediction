mr.
peter
j.
rubin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
peter
rubin
and
i
represent
the
respondent
in
this
matter.
the
first
issue
which
i
would
like
to
discuss
relates
to
the
history
in
maine
of
this
concept
of
felonious
homicide.
as
mr.
arey
pointed
out,
the
district
court
did
reject
that
concept
and
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
its
first
decision
also
rejected
that
concept.
the
maine
court
then
came
forward
with
some
subsequent
decisions
in
which
it
delineated
the
rational
behind
that
particular
concept.
however,
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
concept
has
no
basis
in
the
history
of
maine
that
the
--
in
maine,
the
crimes
have
always
been
murder
and
manslaughter.
the
case
is
supported.
the
state
refers
to
one
case,
state
v.
connolly
which
talks
about
in
terms
about
double
jeopardy
the
underlying
felony
being
the
same.
but
even
in
the
context
in
that
case,
the
court
refers
to
the
crime
of
murder
and
the
crime
of
manslaughter.
the
statutes
refer
to
murder
and
manslaughter.
they
don't
refer
to
felonious
homicide.
and
although,
perhaps
ordinarily,
it
is
true
that
a
federal
court
is
bound
to
accept
the
law
of
a
state
as
it
is
annunciated
by
that
state.
i
think
that
his
interpretation
and
perhaps
one
reason
that
the
charge
here
is
so
much
in
conflict
with
the
concept
of
felonious
homicide
is
that
the
charge
itself
does
reflect
accurately.
the
charge
--
the
law
in
maine
as
it
had
been
given
by
numerous
judges
in
the
past,
and
then
the
maine
law
court
came
forward
with
its
new
concept
of
felonious
homicide
and
that's
why
the
conflicts
appear,
i
believe,
between
the
trial
judge's
charge
and
the
concepts
in
lafferty
and
rollins.
i
think
a
review
of
the
common
law
of
other
states
also
will
show
that
there's
no
other
state
which
has
ever
developed
this
concept
of
felonious
homicide
being
the
underlying
single
crime
at
common
law,
and
that
the
other
states
recognize
the
crimes
--
crime
of
murder
and
manslaughter
to
be
separate
and
distinct
crimes.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i
--
certainly
the
state
of
maine
could
construe
its
law
that
way,
i
think
perhaps
prospectively.
i'm
not
sure
that
in
the
context
of
this
case
where
i
believe
historically
the
law
of
maine
was
--
never
utilized
this
concept
of
felonious
homicide
that
it
would
be
proper
to
do
it
in
the
context
of
this
case
and
cases
prior
to
this
case.
now,
i
don't
take
the
position
state
of
maine
couldn't
do
it
for
the
future.
i
just
don't
think
there's
any
support
in
maine
law
for
it.
i
think
that
on
that
basis,
the
first
circuit
and
judge
gignoux
were
correct,
first
circuit
the
first
time
around
and
judge
gignoux
in
his
opinion
that
a
federal
court
should
not
be
bound
to
accept
the
law
of
maine
in
this
context,
but
should
be
free
to
examine
the
law
itself
and
to
come
to
a
conclusion
that
malice
aforethought
is
an
essential
element
of
the
crime.
state
v.
mary
in
1936
said
that
malice
aforethought
is
an
essential
element
and
that
it's
a
fact.
but
getting
beyond
--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
judge
gignoux
never
has
because
he'd
probably
never
been
given
to
the
opportunity
to.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
the
first
circuit
yes,
but
i
don't
ready
anything
in
that
second
decision
which
says
we
now
agree
with
the
maine
court
if
we
were
free
to
interpret
the
law.
i
think
the
first
circuit
came
to
the
conclusion
after
the
remand
by
this
court
that
it
should
accept
the
maine
law
as
annunciated
and
go
from
there
to
the
merits
of
the
issue.
and
--
but
i
don't
read
anything
in
the
second
first
circuit
decision
which
says
“in
rereading
maine
law,
we
now
agree
that
the
maine
court's
interpretation
is
correct.”
if
we
were
free
to
interpret
the
law
itself.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
well,
i
took
the
position
with
the
first
circuit
that
all
the
remand
said
was
reconsideration,
i'm
sorry,
further
consideration
it
did
not
say
reconsideration.
and
i
took
the
position
that
there
was
a
distinction
there
that
this
court
was
remanding
it
because
an
intervening
case
had
come
down
and
that
it
wanted
to
give
the
first
circuit
an
opportunity
to
review
its
decision
in
light
of
that
intervening
decision.
i
--
obviously
the
first
circuit
did
not
accept
that
argument
and
went
on
to
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
rather
than
sticking
to
its
original
decision
as
to
its
obligation
to
accept
the
law
of
maine
as
annunciated
by
the
maine
court.
the
concept
of
malice
aforethought
itself,
let's
assume
for
a
moment
there
was
and
always
has
been
a
concept
of
felonious
homicide
in
maine.
there
is
no
absolutely
no
support
for
the
proposition
that
malice
aforethought
is
not
a
fact.
even
in
state
v.
connolly,
which
is
again
the
major
case
on
which
the
state
relies,
the
court
said
“the
state
must
affirmatively
show
malice
aforethought.”
it
talks
about
it
as
if
it
were
a
fact,
so
that
even
accepting
the
concept
of
felonious
homicide,
malice
aforethought
itself
is
not
a
public
policy
statement.
never
has
been
in
maine.
it's
always
been
a
fact
which
the
state
--
which
has
been
one
of
the
elements
for
the
state
to
prove
which
they
have
traditionally
proved
by
a
presumption.
i
think
there's
ample
evidence
here
historically
in
the
law
of
maine
which
is
directly
inconsistent
with
this
concept.
i
don't
believe
that
a
federal
court
should
be
foreclosed
from
protecting
the
federal
constitution
in
a
case
merely
because
a
state
court
comes
up
with
an
interpretation
which
is
new
and
sudden.
and
i
recognize
that
this
is
not
identical
to
the
bouie
case
in
terms
of
the
situation
there
and
that
there
was
prejudice
to
the
defendant
when
he
went
in
and
then
sat
down
at
the
counter,
he
wasn't
--
didn't
have
notice
of
the
charges.
but
nevertheless,
in
this
charge
the
whole
trial
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
malice
aforethought
was
an
essential
element,
it
was
a
fact
and
then
the
maine
court
came
forward
with
its
interpretation
which
removes
that.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes.
and
the
maine
court
then
removes
that
constitutional
issue
by
the
way
it
defines
it
law,
and
then
if
this
court
is
foreclosed
from
or
it
has
to
accept
that
interpretation,
we
have
or
mr.
wilbur
has
been
deprived
of
his
right
by
fiat
almost
in
terms
of
the
interpretation.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
it
has
to
be
--
yes,
i
think
it
has
to
be
a
reasonable
response
to
the
provocation.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i
believe
on
the
facts
it
could
be.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes.
i
certainly
--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
right
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i
agree
with
that,
yes.
so
that
i've
come
to
the
conclusion
that
in
reviewing
maine
law
that
this
interpretation
of
felonious
homicide
has
never
been
the
law
of
maine
and
shouldn't
--
this
court
should
not
be
bound,
and
if
this
court
isn't
bound,
then
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
trial
judge
did
accurately
state
the
law
as
it
has
always
been
in
maine
that
malice
aforethought
is
an
essential
element
and
is
a
fact
--
that
it
is
factual
in
nature.
really,
otherwise
there
would've
been
no
reason
for
malice
aforethought
to
ever
been
developed
because
the
court
in
its
charge
could
have
just
say
“once
the
state
is
proved
an
intentional
and
unlawful
killing,
there
arises
a
presumption
of
murder.”
you
wouldn't
have
to
get
into
this
concept
of
presumption
of
malice
aforethought
if
it's
not
a
fact,
if
it's
only
a
public
policy
statement.
don't
--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i'm
not
sure.
i
did
not
represent
the
respondent
at
the
trial
level.
that's
the
item
i
tried
to
think
about
to
make
it
analogous
to
the
bouie
case
in
terms
of
actual
prejudice
to
the
defendant
during
the
trial
stage
where
as
similarly
in
bouie,
there
was
prejudice
to
the
defendant
when
he
walked
into
the
restaurant.
i
don't
know.
i
think
perhaps
it
could,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
exactly
articulate
the
thought
processes
that
perhaps
the
defense
attorney
would
go
through
in
that
situation
in
terms
of
the
burden
of
proof.
certainly,
if
the
state
had
the
burden
of
proving
malice
aforethought
and
disproving
the
provocation,
showing
that
there
was
no
adequate
provocation,
maybe
defense
counsel
in
that
case
would've
objected
to
the
introduction
of
the
statements,
rather
than
making
a
decision
to
rely
on
those
statements
as
the
method
of
proving
his
defense.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
again,
i
don't
know
if
i'm
making
a
distinction
without
a
difference,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
first
circuit
merely
said
“we
understand
that
we
are
obligated
to
accept
that
law,
but
we
do
not
necessarily
agree
that
that
would
be
our
interpretation
of
it
if
we
were
free
to
do
so.”
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
no,
i
would
suggest
that
the
first
decision
by
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
the
correct
one
on
this
particular
issue.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
fine.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i
find
no
fault
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
--
if
accepting
that.
however,
i
do
think
there's
another
--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
yes,
i
would.
and
i
think
--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i
believe
the
first
circuit
said
that
that
is
impermissible
at
least
in
the
context
of
a
single
trial
and
i
would
suspect
the
rationale
of
the
first
circuit
would
apply
equally
to
a
separate
bifurcated
trial
on
that
issue.
i
believe.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
well,
certainly
there're
other
reasons,
for
instance
in
the
insanity
area
to
have
a
bifurcated
trial
other
than
merely
question
of
burden
of
proof.
in
this
context
it
seems
to
me,
and
that
really
gets
into
the
third
issue
on
the
merits
in
this
case
as
i
see
it,
which
is
does
in
re
winship,
the
rational
of
in
re
winship
apply
to
penalty
categorizations.
if
i
could
hold
that
in
advance
just
for
a
minute,
i
will
respond
to
it.
i
think
there's
an
intermediate
issue
which
is
much
narrower,
and
which
i
think
it's
important
for
this
court
to
consider.
and
that
is
that
is
if
you
review
the
charge
in
this
case,
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
judge
did
not
charge
that
the
jury
had
to
prove
an
intentional
and
unlawful
killing.
he
only
charged
that
the
state
must
prove
an
unlawful
killing
and
then
malice
aforethought
is
presumed.
and
if
you
look
at
the
court's
definition
of
malice
aforethought,
it
is
quite
clear
that
that
definition
comprises
the
concept
of
intentional.
so
what
the
trial
judge
was
saying
to
the
jury
was
once
the
state
proves
an
unlawful
killing,
which
in
essence
was
that
the
defendant
killed
the
victim,
there
arises
a
presumption
of
malice
aforethought,
presumption
of
intent
either
a
subjective
intent
to
kill
or
the
implied
malice,
and
then
the
burden
of
proof
shifts
the
defendant
to
disprove
the
intent.
and
i
would
refer
to
--
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
jury
did
come
back
for
further
instructions,
and
at
that
time
the
trial
judge
says
“all
unlawful
killings
are
presumed
to
be
with
malice
aforethought.”
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
its
page
61,
your
honor
and
also
on
page
62.
he
also
says
“when
the
jury
is
satisfied
that
the
killing
was
an
unlawful
killing,
then
the
defendant
in
such
case
has
the
burden
of
satisfying
a
jury
by
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
killing
was
not
with
malice
aforethought.”
what
did
he
mean
by
malice
aforethought?
he
meant
that
it
was
not
intentional.
so
that
i
think
there's
an
intermediate
issue
in
this
case
which
is
much
narrower
than
the
third
issue
to
which
mr.
justice
white
referred,
which
is
that
under
clearly
under
in
re
winship,
the
state
has
to
prove
that
it
was
intentional
and
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
law
of
maine
requires
the
state
to
prove
intent.
in
fact
in
this
case,
the
judge
erroneously
charged
the
jury
that
malice
aforethought,
i.e.
intent,
was
to
be
presumed
until
the
defendant
came
forward
with
evidence
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
disproved
intent.
i
think
that's
a
fairly
--
at
one
point
in
the
beginning
of
the
charge
he
says
“the
state
must
prove
intent
that
the
killing
was
intentional.”
he
then
says
“and
i
would
be
back
to
that
element
at
a
further
time.”
and
i
submit
that
in
reading
the
charge
as
a
whole
when
he
came
back
to
the
element
of
intent,
he
is
saying
to
the
jury
that
the
state
satisfies
that
burden
by
a
presumption.
it
satisfies
its
burden
as
to
intent
by
the
presumption
of
malice
aforethought.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
and
i
wholeheartedly
agree
with
that.
and
i
believe
in
reviewing
the
charge,
there
was
only
one
instance
right
at
the
very
beginning
on
page
20,
i
believe
of
the
appendix,
19
and
20
where
the
court,
i'm
sorry,
where
the
court
refers
to
proving
that
the
state
has
the
obligation
to
prove
intent.
and
then
from
that
point
onwards
throughout
the
rest
of
the
trial,
he
talks
about
malice
aforethought
and
the
presumption
of
malice
aforethought
defines
malice
aforethought
to
include
intent.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i
don't
believe
that
there
was.
i'm
sorry,
it
was
pages
37
and
38
that
where
the
judge
for
the
first
time
refers
the
element
of
intent.
then
at
top
of
page
38
in
the
appendix
he
says
“i'm
going
to
leave
for
now,
my
suggestion,
my
language
concerning
what
the
jury
finding
of
what
the
defendant
intended.”
and
i
submit
from
that
point
on,
there
was
never
a
reference
again
to
the
fact
that
the
defendant
--
the
state
must
prove
intent
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
was
always
in
terms
of
the
presumption
of
malice
aforethought,
the
presumption
of
intent
once
the
state
had
proved
an
unlawful
killing
and
the
defendant
must
disprove
intent.
so
that
i
think
even
reading
the
charge
in
its
entirety,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
judge
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
the
state
satisfies
its
burden
of
proof
on
intent
by
a
presumption
of
intent
after
it
has
proven
certain
other
facts.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
well
i'm
saying
that
it
says
--
no
i
--
well,
yes
in
one
sense.
it
says
one
thing
at
one
point,
and
then
many
other
times
it
says
the
completely
opposite
thing
so
that
--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
the
maine
law
court
accepted
this
issue
under
maine
law
even
though
there
was
no
--
i
don't
believe
there
was
an
exception
because
it
presented
a
serious
issue,
and
under
the
maine
rules,
the
court
itself
could
recognize
and
decide
an
issue
which
it
felt
raise
serious
constitutional
question
even
though
objection
had
not
been
raised.
and
i
think
it
did
so
in
this
case.
so
i
would
submit
that
perhaps,
yes
there
is
that
ordinary
obligation,
but
the
maine
rules
provide
for
a
consideration
of
this
issue
such
as
this
when
they
are
--
the
court
considers
them
to
be
very
important,
and
they
did
so
in
this
case.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
that's
correct
also
your
honor,
yes.
i'd
now
like
to
move
on
to
the
third
issue
to
which
mr.
justice
white
referred,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
rational,
the
underlying
rational
of
in
re
winship
applies
equally
even
when
you're
considering
factual
matters
which
go
to
punishment.
clearly
if
you
accept
the
concept
of
felonious
homicide
as
enunciated
by
the
maine
court,
then
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
provocation
which
relates
to
voluntary
manslaughter
is
a
fact
which
merely
distinguishes
punishment
categories.
certainly
though,
in
the
context
of
winship,
the
difference
between
life
imprisonment
and
a
maximum
of
20
years
is
quite
substantial.
certainly
also,
the
difference
between
a
conviction
of
murder
and
manslaughter
in
terms
of
the
stigma
that's
attached
is
quite
different.
i
think
in
lafferty,
the
maine
court
recognizes
that
murder
has
this
high
degree
of
blame
worthiness,
whereas
manslaughter
is
mitigated
and
it
isn't
considered
quite
so
blame
worthy.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
well,
i
think
that
gets
into
the
third
consideration
for
the
court
which
is
whether
or
not
there're
any
counterbalancing
factors
which
do
not
warrant
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
or
putting
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
state.
i
would
say
that
in
this
situation,
when
you're
talking
about
heat
of
passion
and
sudden
provocation,
the
facts
which
prove
the
killing
by
the
state,
which
the
state
obviously
has
to
prove,
will
also
go
a
long
ways
to
resolving
the
factual
issue
of
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
provocation.
it'll
show
perhaps
the
difference
in
time
there
that
between
the
provocation,
if
there
was
some,
and
the
killing.
it
will
show
just
how
the
killing
occurred
perhaps.
these
are
objective
factors
which
i
think
are
equally
available
to
the
state
as
they
are
to
the
defendant.
whereas
when
you're
talking
about
insanity,
i
think
you're
much
more
severely
limited
to
a
state
of
mind
which
is
not
shown
by
objective
factors,
it's
shown
more
by
subjective
factors,
perhaps
its
more
difficult
in
that
situation
for
the
state
to
come
up
with
evidence,
and
that
would
be
a
reason
when
you're
balancing
the
difficulties
of
proof
in
this
situation
to
say
it
to
distinguish
the
question
of
insanity
from
the
question
of
--
present
in
this
case
of
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
provocation.
i
think
that
clearly,
there
is
much
evidence
that's
equally
available
to
the
state
as
to
the
defendant.
furthermore,
i
think
the
issue
in
winship
revolves
around
whether
or
not
when
the
court
said
at
the
beginning
of
its
holding
that
the
state
must
prove
every
factor
essential
to
the
crime,
whether
when
referring
to
crime,
the
court
was
really
focusing
in
on
the
word
crime
or
the
word
--
the
facts
that
are
essential
to
the
overall
determination
of
what
the
defendant
is
guilty
of.
whether
its
--
whether
you're
talking
about
the
crime
or
you're
talking
about
the
punishment
category.
certainly,
the
facts
of
that
case
in
a
strict
legal
case
were
not
criminal
they
were
juvenile
delinquency
case.
furthermore,
at
the
end
of
the
case,
there's
a
reference
and
an
adoption
of
language
by
justice
fuld
of
the
new
york
court
where
he
talked
about
proving
the
case
against
the
defendant
or
rather
than
the
crime.
i
think
it's
so
important
--
one
of
the
other
underlying
factors
in
winship
was
the
intent
to
minimize
the
chances
of
error
in
a
criminal
trial,
and
because
of
the
fact
that
a
defendant
could
be
--
loses
liberty,
and
because
of
the
stigma
that
attaches
to
a
defendant.
certainly,
that
has
application
whether
you're
talking
about
an
element
of
the
crime,
or
whether
you're
talking
about
something
so
important
even
though
it
only
goes
to
punishment
which
distinguishes
between
the
ultimate
categorization
of
what
the
defendant
will
be
punished
for.
and
here
in
this
case,
the
sole
distinguishing
factor
between
murder
and
manslaughter
is
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
provocation.
and
it
appears
to
me
that
if
you
put
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
to
prove
that
it
was
done
in
the
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
provocation
that
you
are
increasing
the
chances
of
error
substantially
because
as,
i
don't
remember
if
it
was
mr.
justice
white
or
who
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
jury
might
if
they
could
use
this
evidence
on
the
question
of
reasonable
doubt
might
have
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
they
can
not
under
the
instructions
and
therefore
would
have
to
be
or
be
forced
to
convict
the
defendant
of
murder,
even
though
they
were
exactly
even
on
the
question
of
in
the
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
provocation.
so
--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i
don't
believe
he
said
a
majority.
i
believe
the
state
of
maine
in
state
v.
millett
where
they
shifted
the
burden
back
to
the
state
to
disprove
affirmative
defenses.
said
that
they
were
now
adopting
the
majority
rule
which
says
that
the
state
must
--
once
the
issue
was
raised
by
the
defendant
wanted
some
evidence
of
self-defense,
then
the
burden
of
proof
shifts
to
the
state
to
disprove
it.
i
believe
that
is
the
majority
rule.
i
assume
there
probably
are
some
states
which
continue
to
place
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i
think
that
certainly
the
question
of
self-defense,
a
holding
in
this
case
that
winship
is
applicable
to
the
question
of
heat
of
passion
and
sudden
provocation
certainly
would
have
applicability
to
the
rule
of
self-defense.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
no,
because
i
think
self-defense
is
again
a
question
where
there
are
objective
facts,
because
if
you,
for
instance
you
may
have
the
victim
charging
at
the
defendant
there
are
--
and
self
defense
is
not
--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
no,
but
if
there
are
other
witnesses
that
the
state
certainly
has
a
burden
of
showing
that
the
defendant
killed
the
victim
and
the
process
of
doing
so
would
presumably
show
some
of
the
facts
that
surround
it.
i
think
that
there
is
more
apt
to
be
objective
facts
available
on
the
question
of
self
defense
and
heat
of
passion
than
there
are
when
you're
talking
about
the
question
of
insanity.
there
may
be
cases
very
truly
that
the
state
has
no
facts
which
it
could
introduce,
but
i
would
submit
that
probably
in
a
great
majority
of
cases,
the
state
has
ample
evidence
available
to
it,
objective
evidence
relating
--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
only
if
there
has
been
some
evidence
introduced
into
the
case
which
raises
the
issue
of
self-defense.
certainly,
if
there's
no
evidence
in
the
case
which
would
raise
that
issue,
no
i
don't
think
that
the
state
has
to
disprove
it.
but
once
either
the
state
or
the
defendant
has
introduced
some
evidence
of
that,
then
i
think
that
a
decision
in
applying
winship
to
the
facts
of
this
case
could
very
easily
--
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
i
think
that's
true,
but
i
believe
that
the
question
of
self-defense
can
very
easily
go
to
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
in
terms
of
the
intent,
the
unlawfulness
of
the
killing.
one
of
the
definitions
of
unlawful
is
that
it
is
not
excusable
or
justifiable.
and
the
definition
in
maine
anyway
of,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
getting
the
right
one
of
justifiable
i
guess
it
would
be
is
that
it
was
done
in
self-defense.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
--
the
question
of
self-defense
does
go
to
an
element
of
the
crime,
i.e.
that
the
killing
was
unlawful
and
once
that
there's
some
evidence
into
the
case
of
self-defense,
there's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
killing
was
unlawful.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
the
obligation
of
the
state
at
that
point
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
was
unlawful,
i.e.
that
it
was
not
in
self-defense.
so
that
i
think
that
it
could
very
well
go
strictly
to
the
element
of
the
crime
of
unlawfulness
of
the
killing.
i
think
though
that
the
court
could
avoid
all
those
issues
and
avoid
all
the
issues
the
applicability
of
winship
to
--
in
the
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
provocation
by
deciding
this
case
on
the
intermediary
to
the
second
issue
which
is
discussed,
which
is
that
the
state
in
this
case
or
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
placed
the
burden
of
proof
as
to
intent
on
the
defendant
to
disprove
intent
once
the
state
had
proved
an
unlawful
killing.
and
as
such,
the
--
it
seems
to
me
everybody
agrees
that
intent
is
an
element
of
the
crime
of
felonious
homicide,
if
that's
the
crime.
it's
an
element
of
the
crime
of
murder,
if
murder
is
the
crime.
and
i
believe
that
the
defendant
was
required
to
disprove
it.
i
think
--
believe
that
that
would
fall
right
squarely
within
winship
without
any
extension
winship
or
elaboration
on
it.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
peter
j.
rubin
it's
been
my
pleasure
your
honor.
