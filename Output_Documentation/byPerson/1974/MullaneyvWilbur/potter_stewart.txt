justice
potter
stewart
in
an
unlawful
killing?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
jury
is
never
given
a
verdict
form
that
talks
about
felonious
homicide,
is
it
in
any
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
not
a
practice.
justice
potter
stewart
in
those
traditional
terms
coming
down
to
that
common
sense
language,
this
charge
put
upon
the
defendant
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
states
were
oregon,
louisiana
and
proposed
in
michigan,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
most
states
it's
in
affirmative
defense.
justice
potter

post
again
to
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence.
justice
potter

well
and
then
too
isn't
it
true
that
as
of
the
time
this
trial
there
really
wasn't
much
to
accept
no
basis
in
which
to
accept?
