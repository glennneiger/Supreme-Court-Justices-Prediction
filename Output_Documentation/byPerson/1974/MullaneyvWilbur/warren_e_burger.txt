chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
mullaney
against
wilbur,
74-13.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
mr.
arey.
you
pronounce
it
arey
or
arey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
arey.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
can
hardly
call
that
a
contention
in
the
traditional
sense,
can
you?
since
he
didn't
take
the
stand
and
it's
gone
into
the
record
sort
of
backward,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
point
on
that
is
that
this
court
has
approved
oregon
specifically
submitting
to
the
jury
two
different
elements
of
the
case,
i
won't
say
to
the
crime
of
the
case,
with
two
different
standards,
one
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
one
by
preponderance
to
the
evidence
by
way
to
confirm
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
they
have
changed
the
statute
right
after
leland.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
the
statute
today
in
oregon
is
exactly
the
way
you
postulate
the
maine
law.
they
must
treat
it
as
permanent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
arey.
mr.
rubin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
state
of
maine
cannot
construe
its
own
law
in
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
response
to
a
question
by
mr.
justice
white,
mr.
arey
said
that
if
there
was
provocation
shown,
then
there
could
never
be
a
murder,
at
least
that's
the
way
i
understood
him.
now,
does
maine
law
not
recognize
that
there
can
what
we'd
call
an
overreaction
that
is
that
the
response
to
the
provocation
was
more
than
and
unjustified
more
than
necessary
and
unjustified?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
there
was
a
provocation
and
the
man
provoked
who
was
on
trial
is
shown
then
to
have
gone
back
into
his
house
and
got
a
shotgun
and
came
out
and
shot
the
provoking
party
dead.
now,
could
that
not
be
murder
in
maine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
--
the
ones
i've
postulated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
perhaps
he
wasn't
--
he
may
clear
that
up
later.
i
certainly
should
think
that
that
would
not
be
manslaughter
any
longer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
that
takes
away
some
of
the
reason
for
having
bifurcated
trials,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
must
do
it
exactly
the
same
way
on
the
second
on
the
penalty
trial
as
you
do
in
a
trial
on
the
issue
of
guilt
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
in
the
record
appendix?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
rubin.
thank
you
gentlemen.
mr.
rubin
you
acted
at
the
court's
request
and
by
the
court's
appointment
here.
and
thank
you
for
your
assistance
to
the
court
and
of
course
your
assistance
to
the
gentleman
you're
representing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-13,
mullaney
against
wilbur
will

announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
chief
justice
warren
