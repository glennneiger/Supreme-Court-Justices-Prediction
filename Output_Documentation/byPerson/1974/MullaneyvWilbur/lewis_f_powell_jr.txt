justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
petitioners
are
the
state
of
maine
and
its
prison
warden.
respondent
was
convicted
of
murder
under
a
maine
procedure
that
placed
the
burden
on
him
to
prove
that
he
had
acted
in
a
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
provocation.
only
if
he
carried
this
burden
could
he
reduce
the
charge
of
murder
to
manslaughter.
after
exhausting
his
state
remedies,
respondent
filed
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court
challenging
the
maine
procedure.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
imposition
of
this
burden
on
respondent
constituted
a
denial
of
due
process.
we
follow
this
court's
decision
in
in
re
winship
which
requires
the
prosecution
in
a
criminal
case
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
every
fact
necessary
to
constitute
the
charge
--
the
crime
charged.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
joined.
