mr.
arey,
i
could
understand
that
better
if
these
were
bifurcated
crime,
but
this
is
all
in
one
crime.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
judge
has
got
to
sought
all
of
these
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
those
sorting
out
in
a
criminal
trial,
there
is
a
burden
of
preponderance
of
evidence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
doesn't
get
you
in
any
trouble?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
jury
is
doing
all
of
this
at
one
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
one
room,
and
you
think
that
the
jury
first
goes
through
his
part
about
his
guilty
of
a
felonious
murder,
and
then
will
get
to
the
sentencing
part.
i
would
submit
that
you
don't
know
what
that
jury
does.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
jury
can
very
well
be
all
fouled
up
in
between
where
we
use
preponderance
and
where
we
use
reasonable
doubt.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
certainly
will
get
confused.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
was
talking
about
preponderance
as
a
reasonable
doubt.
those
are
so
far
apart,
and
when
i
as
a
juror
i'm
thinking
“well,
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
thinking
a
preponderance
or
reasonable
doubt
on
this,
i
don't
know.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
it's
a
little
different
in
maine.
in
new
york,
they
have
murder
one,
murder
two.
they
have
about
four
of
them.
