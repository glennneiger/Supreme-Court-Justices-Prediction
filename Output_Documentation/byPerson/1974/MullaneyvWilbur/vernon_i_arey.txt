your
honor.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
vernon
arey
and
i
represent
the
petitioners
in
the
instant
case,
warden
garrell
s.
mullaney
of
the
maine
state
prison
in
the
state
of
maine.
facts
of
this
case
briefly
as
follows;
the
trial
although
the
state's
case
against
the
respondent
in
this
case
whom
i
shall
refer
to
--throughout
my
discussion
as
the
defendant,
since
he
appeared
in
that
posture
below
and
i
referred
to
him
as
such
in
my
brief.
the
state
of
maine
alleged
that
mr.
wilbur
had
alleged
--
had
inflicted
such
severe
injuries
upon
the
victim,
mr.
claude
hebert
with
his
fists
and
a
blunt
instrument
that
mr.
hebert
died
shortly
after
receiving
this
beating.
the
theory
of
the
defense
was
that
though
this
beating
had
been
inflicted,
the
actions
had
been
generated
by
the
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
provocation
because
of
an
indecent
homosexual
overture
made
by
mr.
hebert.
the
jury
rejected
this
contention
and
convicted
the
defendant
of
murder.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
well,
your
honor
i
think
that
depends
upon
tactics
of
counsel.
counsel
--
excuse
me,
whether
wisely
or
unwisely
apparently
made
the
decision
that
he
did
not
have
to
place
the
defendant
on
the
stand
and
chose
to
do
it
through
failure
to
object
to
the
entrance
into
evidence
of
the
statements
of
the
defendant
as
to
what
happened
of
that
time,
and
then
relied
upon
his
opening
argument
to
point
out
to
the
jury
how
he
had
felt
he
admit
his
burden
as
it
was
imposed
by
the
state
of
maine.
after
a
complex
procedural
history,
which
need
not
concern
us
here,
the
defendant
in
1971
appealed
this
case
to
the
maine
supreme
judicial
court.
essentially,
he
argued
at
that
time
and
in
substance
that
the
presiding
justice
at
his
trial
had
committed
error
when
it
charged
that
once
the
state
had
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
an
intentional
and
an
unlawful
killing
that
malice
aforethought
would
be
presumed
and
that
the
burden
would
be
on
the
defendant
to
mitigate
the
crime
thus
proved
to
manslaughter
of
the
voluntary
type.
unless
he,
the
defendant,
established
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
crime
was
committed
upon
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
adequate
provocation.
this
has
generated
essentially
one
issue
in
this
case.
and
that
issue
is
whether
in
placing
the
burden
upon
the
defendant
to
show
even
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
the
absence
of
malice
aforethought,
the
court
has
denied
the
defendant
on
this
case
due
process
of
law
under
the
rational
of
in
re
winship.
maine
court
rejected
any
possible
winship
violation
on
two
essential
grounds.
first,
it
recognized
that
the
maine
law
establishes
as
part
of
its
fundamental
system
a
single
generic
concept
of
felonious
homicide
and
that
once
a
felonious
homicide
is
proved,
criminality
is
established.
but
more
than
that
in
this
case
and
when
i
get
to
the
lower
felonious
homicide,
i
will
again
be
emphasizing
this.
the
maine
law
requires
not
only
the
mirror
establishment
of
a
felonious
homicide
with
constituent
elements
to
erect
a
presumption
of
malice,
but
a
felonious
homicide
of
a
particular
type
and
that
is
a
felonious
homicide
which
is
either
intentional
or
which
is
characterized
by
acts,
which
when
objectively
evaluated
have
a
very
high
depth
producing
potential.
if
those
approved,
the
state
of
maine
establishes
as
its
policy
the
crime
as
murder
definitionally
proved.
the
process
by
which
we
define
this
is
called
a
presumption
of
malice.
the
maine
court
in
wilbur
traced
the
history
of
the
single
generic
concept
to
felonious
homicide
as
it
existed
in
maine
for
a
hundred
years
and
said,
“in
viewing
winship,
we
find
that
the
case
of
in
re
winship
is
confined
to
its
facts.”
which
essentially
is
talking
about
elements
of
criminality,
when
we
are
making
the
decision
on
the
first
instant,
whether
it
be
to
brand
and
a
juvenile
or
the
label
of
delinquent,
or
a
man
with
the
label
of
criminal
that
different
factors
are
involved
in
making
a
determination
as
to
what
due
process
means
given
that
context.
in
maine,
we
are
not
doing
this
in
the
first
instance.
we
are
making
a
determination
as
to
what
the
appropriate
penalty
shall
be
for
a
felonious
homicide.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
as
far
as
i
know
the
statutes
of
maine
have
never
spoken
of
felonious
homicide.
but
tracing
through
the
history
of
this
case,
i
think
it
would
become
clear
that
this
is
deemed
of
no
significance
by
the
court
and
has
been
acquiesced
in
by
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
its
decision.
the
second
ground
that
the
maine
law
court
denied
the
defendant's
appeal
on
was
essentially
that
the
case
of
winship
even
if
extended
in
the
view
of
the
maine
court
would
not
be
retroactive.
and
of
course
it's
conceded
by
all,
but
that
is
not
the
case.
the
case
of
in
re
winship
has
been
made
retroactive
by
ivan
v.
city
of
new
york.
the
defendant
in
this
case
then
petitioned
the
district
court
for
its
southern
division
with
district
of
maine
petition
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
alleging
the
same
material
that
he
has
alleged
here
and
we
are
arguing
about
before
this
court
that
he
argued
before
the
maine
law
court.
petition
was
granted
with
the
reference
to
that
one
issue,
but
the
opinion
and
order
of
the
honorable
justice
gignoux
being
that
there
was
no
such
thing
in
the
state
of
maine
as
the
crime
of
felonious
homicide.
that
the
maine
statutes
would
not
speak
of
the
crime
of
felonious
homicide
and
that
the
state
of
maine
is
in
effect
misapplying
its
own
law.
the
state
timely
appealed
from
that
decision
of
the
district
court
and
went
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
boston.
pending
the
state's
appeal
to
the
first
circuit
court
in
boston,
the
state
--
a
case
state
v.
rollins,
which
is
found
at
295
a.
2d
914
and
is
cited
in
the
brief,
and
is
an
important
in
establishing
what
the
concept
of
felonious
homicide
is
in
maine,
was
decided
by
the
lower
court.
it
fully
reaffirms
the
principles
which
were
announced
by
justice
weber
and
the
original
decision
in
mr.
wilbur's
appeal
to
that
court.
the
case
was
briefed
and
argued
before
the
first
circuit,
and
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed.
the
state
of
maine
then
petitioned
this
honorable
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
during
the
pendency
of
the
writ
of
certiorari,
the
case
of
state
v.
lafferty
was
decided
by
the
maine
law
court.
in
state
v.
lafferty
is
found
at
309
a.
2d
647,
and
the
case
of
state
v.
lafferty
expressly
rejected
the
right
of
either
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
or
of
the
federal
district
court
to
indicate
and
dictate
to
the
state
of
maine
what
its
law
was
and
that
the
state
of
maine
was
proper
in
deciding
its
law
and
went
on
further
to
reaffirm
the
principle
of
the
concept
of
felonious
homicide
as
announced
in
the
original
wilbur
decision.
this
court
granted
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
summarily
vacated
the
first
circuit
decision,
remanded
the
case
to
the
first
circuit
in
boston
for
consideration
in
light
of
the
case
of
state
v.
lafferty.
upon
reconsideration,
we
finally
were
postured
with
the
court
--
the
position
of
the
case
as
it
is
before
this
honorable
court
today,
because
on
remand,
the
first
circuit
acceded
to
the
fact
that
the
law
of
maine
recognized
the
concept
of
a
single
generic
offense
within
which
the
penalty
category
designations
of
murder
and
manslaughter
operated
not
as
elements
of
criminality,
but
as
elements
or
factors
bearing
upon
the
punishment
of
an
individual
who
has
had
the
determination
made
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
is
a
criminal.
however,
the
court
went
on
despite
this
fact,
the
case
of
in
re
winship
as
it
is
announced
as
a
matter
of
policy
should
apply
to
this
situation
because
of
the
potential
stigma
which
an
individual
faces
when
he
is
faced
in
the
difference
between
life
imprisonment
and
20
years
for
manslaughter
or
the
possibility
of
probation
and
the
possibility
of
a
man's
loss
of
liberty
is
as
great
in
a
situation
where
you
are
determining
punishment
as
it
is
when
you
are
making
the
decision
in
the
first
instance
of
criminality.
the
state
respectfully
suggests
that
that
is
an
unwarranted
extension
of
the
case
of
in
re
winship
beyond
the
facts
and
limitations
to
which
it
spoke.
the
state
further
suggests
that
in
the
there
are
cases
in
this
court
which
have
indicated
and
which
were
relied
upon
by
the
state
of
maine
in
the
original
wilbur
decision
that
factors
bearing
upon
punishment
have
been
treated
differently,
and
we
ask
ourselves
why.
and
as
we
go
through
the
concept
of
felonious
homicide,
i
hope
that
i
can
explain
that
to
the
court.
it
is
critical
that
this
court
understand
what
the
state
of
maine
is
talking
about
when
it
talks
about
the
concept
of
a
single
generic
offense
as
it
is
designated
in
the
common
law
of
the
state
of
maine.
essentially,
the
concept
is
there
is
one
generic
offense,
an
unlawful
or
a
felonious
homicide.
and
that
this
unlawful
or
felonious
homicide
consists
of
degrees
and
that
these
degrees
consist
of
murder
and
manslaughter.
manslaughter
being
again
divided
into
two
degrees,
common
law
manslaughter
and
voluntary
manslaughter,
and
these
degrees
are
nothing
more
nor
less
than
punishment
categories
which
society
has
designated
in
advance
for
actions
which
have
certain
results
attributed
to
them.
now
what
are
the
elements
of
felonious
homicide?
the
elements
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
the
single
generic
concept
your
honor,
yes
i
believe
arguably
in
the
situation
of
assault.
that
assault
is
recognized
as
the
underlying
crime
and
the
element
of
high
in
aggravation
is
recognized
as
only
going
to
punishment.
high
in
aggravation
is
not
recognized
as
being
a
criminal
element.
now,
the
state
of
maine
does
require
that
the
element
of
high
in
aggravation
be
decided
by
a
jury
and
it
also
requires
that
it
be
decided
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
i
am
not
sure
that
that
decision
would
come
about
the
same
way
nor
am
i
sure
that
the
ferris
case,
and
that's
the
case
i'm
referring
to,
is
analogous
to
this
one,
and
why
do
i
say
that.
i
say
that
because
there
is
no
middle
ground
in
assault
by
which
we're
going
to
put
any
burden
upon
the
defendant
to
disprove
or
prove
anything.
there
is
either
simple
assault
which
is
the
criminal
act
in
itself
or
the
element
of
high
in
aggravation.
there
is
no
middle
ground
by
which
it
can
drop
back
into.
in
other
words,
if
in
the
state
of
maine
there
were
only
manslaughter
and
murder,
you
would
have
an
analogous
situation,
there'll
be
no
reason
for
a
presumption
because
there's
nothing
to
mitigate
to.
you're
talking
about
either
criminality
or
non-criminality
the
minute
you
drop
back
to
the
lower
designation.
secondly,
i
would
argue
that
on
the
facts
of
the
case
as
we
posture
it
in
felonious
homicide
punishable
as
murder,
the
case
is
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
because
unlike
the
original
common
law
presumption
which
required
only
the
showing
of
an
unlawful
killing,
and
which
required
the
defendant
to
establish
factors
in
excuse
and
justification
as
well
as
in
palliation,
the
main
presumption
does
not
arise
until
the
state
has
proven
an
intentional
and
an
unlawful
killing.
and
the
definition
of
unlawful
is
a
killing
which
is
not
justified
nor
excused,
the
state
bearing
the
burden
upon
the
factors
of
criminality,
the
defendant
bearing
the
burden
only
upon
the
elements
of
palliation.
now,
the
elements
of
felonious
homicide
in
the
first
instance
are
that
the
victim
is
dead
and
unless
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
second
that
the
defendant
killed
the
victim.
third,
that
the
killing
was
voluntary
that
is
that
it
was
an
act
of
his
will.
and
lastly,
that
the
killing
is
unlawful
and
that
is
that
it's
not
justified
nor
excused.
felonious
homicide
punishable
as
murder
has
precisely
the
same
four
elements
with
one
additional,
and
that
is
that
the
killing
and
addition
to
all
these
other
things
be
intentional.
if
that
is
the
case,
the
law
of
maine
says
that
constitutes
murder
in
that
law
by
definition.
the
process
by
which
we
do
this
is
a
presumption,
a
so
called
presumption
of
malice.
malice
--mr.
justice
rehnquist
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
to
the
extent
that
it
says
that
i
would
have
to
say
yes.
there
is
no
question
your
honor,
but
what
this
is
not
the
best
charge
for
which
to
deal.
i
would
point
out
however
that
when
we
talk
about
crimes
even
when
we
are
known
to
be
talking
about
degrees,
we
sometimes
use
the
word
crime.
for
example,
we
speak
about
the
crime
of
first
degree
murder
and
yet
we
know
that
first
degree
murder
is
nothing
more
than
a
degree
of
a
crime
to
a
murder.
i
would
suggest
that
the
language
of
the
court
if
read
in
context,
the
context
within
which
the
charge
is
given
fairly
supports
the
rational
of
the
maine
law
court
as
announced
in
wilbur,
rollins,
and
lafferty.
i
would
suggest
that
you
do
not
start
in
the
middle
of
the
charge
where
the
judge
is
talking
about
palliation
and
assuming
that
the
state
has
proven
an
intentional
and
unlawful
killing,
but
that
you
start
at
the
beginning
of
the
charge
and
read
it
from
beginning
to
end
given
all
of
the
assumptions,
excuse
me,
that
must
come
from
what
is
fairly
read
in
the
charge.
i
further
would
cite
that
--
that
not
only
did
the
maine
law
court
say
precisely
that
this
is
what
they
had
done
and
as
according
to
the
language
of
justice
weber
in
the
original
wilbur
appeal,
the
court
at
instruction
was
predicated
by
the
court.
and
this
is
the
instruction
about
the
use
of
the
language
to
which
your
honor
is
referring,
language
which
is
inconsistent
perhaps
with
the
position
of
the
maine
law
court.
the
court
at
instruction
was
predicated
by
the
court
upon
the
assumption
that
the
jury
had
first
been
satisfied,
and
your
honors
will
find
this
language
on
page
85
of
the
printed
appendix,
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
direct
your
attention
to
that,
that
the
jury
had
first
been
satisfied
that
the
state
had
proven
a
voluntary
and
an
intentional
killing
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
is
the
assumption
that
has
been
throughout
this
case
at
the
time
that
the
judge
is
talking
about
mitigation.
it's
not
on
the
assumption
of
the
maine
law
court.
it's
the
assumption
of
the
federal
district
court
in
its
opinion,
first
opinion.
and
it's
the
decision
of
the
first
circuit
after
the
remand
of
state
v.
lafferty
that
the
jury
had
first
been
instructed
that
there
was
an
intentional
and
an
unlawful
killing
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
the
presumption
arose.
now
malice
aforethought
as
maine
views
it,
and
as
i
have
indicated
as
nothing
more
than
a
term
of
act,
having
no
independent
meaning
of
viability
apart
from
the
context
out
of
which
it
arose,
and
that
is
that
felonious
homicide
which
are
intentional
shall
have
attributed
to
them
the
highest
degree
of
blame
within
this
for
punishment
purposes,
wherein
again
we
call
this
policy
the
so
called
presumption
of
malice.
now
what
is
voluntary
manslaughter
within
the
concept
of
felonious
homicide?
the
punishment
category
of
voluntary
manslaughter
has
precisely
the
same
elements
that
murder
does
an
intentional
and
an
unlawful
killing.
but
the
unlawful
killing
must
have
been
generated
by
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
adequate
provocation.
it
constitutes
nothing
more
than
a
mitigating
factor
to
the
charge
of
felonious
homicide
punishable
as
murder.
to
explain
this
further,
in
a
charge
for
manslaughter,
the
state
would
not
necessarily
bear
the
burden
on
the
fact
--
on
the
issue
of
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
adequate
provocation.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that's
correct.
and
the
reason
it
can
not
be
your
honor
is
because
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
you
can
not
find
a
murder.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that
is
the
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
the
aspect
of
the
maliciousness,
yes.
to
that
extent,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
merely
a
matter
of
mitigation.
we're
saying,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
we're
gong
to
say
that
this
particular
crime
will
be
punished.
how
will
it
be
punished?
it
would
be
punished
by
whatever
the
penalty
is
for
murder.
but
if
you
can
convince
us
that
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
is
intentional
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it's
unlawful,
it
should
be
punished
as
manslaughter
by
establishing
this
element
will
do
it.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that's
correct.
that's
precisely
the
way
it
works.
but
because
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
and
the
reason
we
say
that
is
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
i
would
say
no
to
that
--
i'd
say
yes,
even
we
balanced
evidence
creates
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
when
you're
talking
within
the
concept
of
a
punishment
category,
instead
of
the
concept
is
to
whether
or
not
the
verdict
is
going
to
be
guilty
or
not
guilty.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
and
you
do
that
quite
apart
from
the
fact
as
which
bearing
heat
of
passion
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that's
correct.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
would've
known.
okay,
he
would
not
have
punished
it
as
murder.
so
there
is
--
yes,
there
is
burden
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
manslaughter?
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
it's
guilty
of
manslaughter.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
no,
it
is
just
guilty
of
manslaughter.
and
the
verdict
of
guilty
of
murder
is
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
pardon?
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
no
you
could
not.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
as
far
as
double
jeopardy
provisions
are
concerned,
yes.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
depends
upon
what
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows.
if
the
--
if
in
fact
the
issue
of
voluntary
manslaughter
is
in
the
case,
the
verdict
form
would
be
guilty
of
murder,
guilty
of
manslaughter,
not
guilty.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that's
correct.
murder,
manslaughter,
not
guilty.
now
it
must
be
remembered
that
again
it's
a
given
that
we're
talking
about
an
intentional
and
an
unlawful
killing,
and
therefore
the
only
branch
of
felonious
homicide
punishable
as
manslaughter
which
was
given
to
the
jury
was
voluntary
manslaughter
that
does
exist
a
felonious
homicide
which
is
involuntary
manslaughter,
and
that
is
essentially
speaking
in
terms
of
what
it
takes
to
arrive
the
criminality
bears
the
same
elements
as
we
have
in
discussing
what
a
felonious
homicide
is
in
the
first
instance.
if
the
state
proves
a
mere
unlawful
homicide
and
does
not
carry
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
intent,
then
the
verdict
could
very
properly
be
guilty
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
an
unlawful
killing
nothing
more.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
no,
it
is
not
your
honor.
no
it
is
not.
that
is
not
to
say
that
the
jury
could
not
be.
it
is
simply
just
to
say
it
is
not.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
and
i
think
the
reason
for
it
is
because
it's
easier
to
talk
to
a
jury
and
have
them
comprehend
in
traditional
terms.
such
as
you
and
i
talk
about
the
crime
perhaps
of
first-degree
murder
knowing
full
well
that
murder
divided
into
first
and
second
degree
is
really
one
crime,
murder.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
now,
we
maintain
that
it
did
not.
we
maintain
it
put
the
burden
of
proof
upon
him
to
reduce
the
crime
from
murder
to
manslaughter.
we
say
that
because
the
presence
or
absence
of
heat
of
passion
on
sudden
adequate
provocation
is
irrelevant
to
an
establishment
of
murder,
either
as
a
punishment
category,
and
as
a
punishment
category
and
it's
also
irrelevant
to
the
establishment
of
a
crime.
whether
heat
of
passion
is
present
or
absent
in
the
case
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
whether
the
crime
is
lawful
or
unlawful
on
the
first
instance
and
whether
it
will
be
punished
as
murder
or
manslaughter
in
the
first
instance
when
the
jury
is
viewing
the
evidence
that
has
been
presented
by
the
state's
case.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that's
correct.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that's
correct
your
honor.
much
the
same
as
they
have
to
sought
out
the
defenses
of
insanity
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
we
say
no,
and
we
say
no
first
of
all
because
the
case
of
in
re
winship
has
been
defined,
as
we
see
it,
as
bearing
up
on
punishment
elements.
and
second,
even
if
the
same
harms
could
be
said
to
accrue
at
the
time
that
the
jury
is
considering
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
to
mitigate
the
homicide,
we
are
no
longer
dealing
with
a
man
who
is
innocent
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
and
who
was
no
longer
shielded
and
protected
by
the
presumption
of
innocence,
because
we
have
a
man
whom
the
jury
had
to
find
by
definition
committed
an
intentional
and
an
unlawful
killing
upon
another
human
being
in
a
state
which
has
defined
those
actions
as
constituting
murder.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
precisely,
that
the
same
analysis
could
apply.
and
that
we're
dealing
with
a
matter
of
definition
of
the
state's
internal
law
as
to
what
does
or
what
does
not
constitute
a
crime,
and
the
facts
of
this
case
and
as
it
is
viewed
by
the
maine
law
court
does
not
come
up
--
the
due
process
is
not
violated.
we're
not
saying
that
fairness
doesn't
apply.
we're
not
saying
that
some
of
the
same
high
may
not
float,
but
we're
saying
you
view
due
process
differently
when
you're
dealing
with
a
man
who
is
guilty
and
who
has
been
found
to
be
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
than
you
do
a
man
with
whom
you
are
taking
in
and
trying
to
make
a
determination
on
the
first
instance
as
to
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
yes,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
well
we
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that
was
discussed
in
leland
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that
was
discussed
in
leland
versus
oregon
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
assumption
has
to
be
that
juries
follow
the
instructions
that
we
give
them,
that
juries
have
been
given
conflicting
burdens
in
criminal
cases
for
years
and
have
managed
to
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
well
that
the
determination
of
what
proof
was
beyond
reasonable
doubt
is
defined.
the
burden
that
deals
with
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
defined.
and
when
we
tell
a
jury
that
he
has
to
bear
the
burden
of
the
defense
in
some
states
of
insanity,
or
the
defense
in
some
states
what
constitutes
self-defense
by
a
preponderance.
we
have
different
burdens
given
on
different
issues
in
jury
trials
all
the
time.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
not
after
we've
proven
an
intentional
and
an
unlawful
killing
because
that
definitionally
is
murder.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
it
does
not
--
he
does
not
find
him
innocent
in
the
criminal
sense,
your
honor
he
has
committed
exactly
the
same
acts.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
because
there's
a
matter
of
--
the
fact
that
we
say
that
if
the
jury
in
fact
finds
him
guilty
of
manslaughter
that
the
state
as
a
matter
of
simple,
call
it
procedural
fairness
of
dues
without
any
reference
to
double
jeopardy
concepts,
will
not
allow
the
state
to
retry
him
for
murder.
and
that
analysis
would
follow.
now
this
is
not
a
unique
approach.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
unlawful.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
right.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
intentionality
remains,
unlawfulness
remains,
everything
remains
but
the
law
has
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
of
everything
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
right.
that's
correct,
of
everything
necessary
to
convict
for
murder.
but
the
law
is
a
matter
of
policy
would
say
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
well
that
may
be
so,
but
i
would
maintain
that
we
probably
could
not
under
the
maine
law,
because
we
would
say
as
a
matter
of
fairness,
it's
not
fair
for
the
state
--
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
under
the
maine
law
of
what
constitutes
fairness,
now
the
issue
is
never
been
presented.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
if
it
could
not
be.
now,
this
is
not
a
unique
approach.
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
statutory
scheme
of
the
states
of
oregon,
louisiana,
the
proposed
criminal
code
in
michigan
and
most
notably
the
state
of
new
york,
which
to
our
view
treats
the
proposition
exactly
the
same
as
we
do.
they
define
and
take
the
concept
of
a
single
generic
offense.
they
define
what
they
mean
by
murder
and
manslaughter
and
they
say
specifically
in
talking
about
murder
that
when
a
person
causes
a
death
of
another
with
the
intent
to
cause
the
death
of
another
person,
but
he
maintains
that
he
does
not
commit
murder
because
he
acted
under
the
influence
of
extreme
emotional
disturbance,
this
constitutes
a
mitigating
circumstance
reducing
to
manslaughter
in
the
first
degree.
however,
this
need
not
be
proved
by
the
prosecution
initiated
--
by
the
prosecution
in
any
prosecution
initiated
under
the
manslaughter
provision.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
i'm
just
--
i'm
just
citing
that
for
the
proposition
that
the
concept
of
felonious
homicide
and
of
voluntary
manslaughter
as
being
only
a
mitigating
factor
is
not
unique.
thank
you.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
i
believe
they
proposed
in
michigan,
the
ali
model
penal
code,
they're
all
in
my
brief
your
honor.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
a
great
number
do
but
maine
does
not,
and
that's
why
we
say
we're
consistent
with
the
theory
because
self-defense
goes
to
criminality,
we
require
the
state
to
negative.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
in
most,
but
i
know
in
a
great
many.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
that's
correct.
as
they
view
it,
we
don't
view
it.
we
don't
view
heat
of
passion
of
some
provocation
is
going
to
kill
and
ever
since
we
do
self-defense.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
oh,
no.
i
can't
say
that.
no
i
wouldn't
--
oregon
has
not
done
that.
leland
--
the
problem
in
leland
was
that
the
defendant
had
to
bear
the
burden
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
subsequently,
yes.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
right,
i'm
not
sure
that
their
analysis
is
the
same
your
honor,
but
clearly
the
burdens
are.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
i
suppose
that
under
the
theory
that
the
state
could
do
that,
because
the
absence
--
presence
or
absence
of
heat
of
passion
is
not
an
element
of
anything.
mr.
vernon
i.
arey
for
penalty.
thank
you.
