mr.
arey,
your
statute
--
am
i
correct
your
statute
doesn't
speak
in
so
many
words
of
felonious
homicide?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
that
it
can't
be
both,
but
if
there's
a
provocation,
it
can't
be
murder.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
if
there
is
provocation
that
you
can
not
find
a
felonious
--
a
murder,
you
can't
find
murder.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
not
find
whatever
element
it
is
that
makes
it
murder,
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
malice
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
you
as
a
jury
man
was
a
--
sitting
in
jury,
when
you
thought
the
evidence
on
provocation
was
absolutely
evenly
balanced,
and
you
thought
that
“well,
i've
been
instructed
not
to
find
this
man
guilty
of
murder
except
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
--
unless
i'm
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but
under
these
instructions,
apparently
i
can't
let
this
evenly
balanced
evidence
on
provocation
create
a
reasonable
doubt
in
my
mind,
because
the
defendant
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
convince
me
by
preponderance.”
justice
byron
r.
white
well
isn't
that
a
fairly
--
isn't
arguably
that's
a
--
isn't
that
an
invasion
of
the
reasonable
doubt
standard?
wouldn't
you
say
that
if
evidence
is
evenly
balanced
on
provocation,
but
if
it
were
proved
beyond
by
preponderance
he
wouldn't
be
guilty
of
murder?
wouldn't
you
say
evenly
balanced
evidence
would
create
a
--
should
create
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
still
have
to
find
him
guilty
of
murder.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
jury
still
brings
in
a
verdict,
guilty
of
murder.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
and
that
the
juryman
says
to
himself
though
“if
i
could've
let
this
evidence
on
provocation
which
is
evenly
balanced
create
a
reasonable
doubt,
i
would've
found
him
innocent
--
of
murder.”
justice
byron
r.
white
he
would've
found
him
innocent
of
murder.
what
does
the
jury
--
what
does
the
verdict
look
like
when
it
comes
in
if
the
jury
accepts
the
--
and
finds
him
guilty
of
homicide?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
manslaughter.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
about
--
is
it
not
guilty
of
murder
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
you
can't
try
him
for
murder
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
never
try
him
for
murder
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it's
implied
that
they
have
found
him
innocent
of
murder?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
don't
even
incur
that
he's
innocent
and
murdered
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
--
i
suppose
you
really
ought
to
answer
that
the
jury
when
it
finds
a
defendant
guilty
of
manslaughter
does
not
find
him
innocent
of
murder.
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
say
he
could
be
put
back
on
trial
for
the
--
in
the
same
offense?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
jury
finds
him
--
would
you
--
the
two
elements
of
murder
the
way
you
say
are
just
an
intentional
killing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
intentional?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
when
the
jury
finds,
in
a
trial
like
this,
finds
him
guilty
of
manslaughter.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
the
jury
has
found
him
guilty
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
those
two
elements
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
you
ought
to
be
able
to
try
him
again
for
it
if
it
were
reversed
on
appeal
for
some
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
maine
law
of
double
jeopardy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
would
only
be
because
they
found
him
innocent
once
at
murder.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
really
should
--
i
would
think
to
say
that
maine
could
also
put
the
burden
on
the
prosecution
to
prove
the
absence
of
provocation
by
a
preponderance
to
the
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
for
just
for
a
penalty,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
finally
got
around
to
accepting
the
law
of
maine
the
way
the
supreme
court
of
maine
interpreted
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
suggesting
that
we
should
take
a
different
of
the
maine
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
either
the
supreme
court
of
maine
or
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that's
different
from
the
supreme
court
of
maine.
justice
byron
r.
white
about
maine
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
let's
assume
that
we
accept
the
maine
law
as
the
supreme
court
of
maine
ultimately
found
it
to
be,
and
at
the
end
that
the
court
of
appeals
recognized.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
fault
do
you
find
with
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
then.
suppose
that
maine
in
order
to
implement
this
view
of
a
single
crime
but
with
different
punishments
for
different
degrees
had
a
separate
penalty
trial,
and
at
the
first
trial
they
simply
an
issue
of
finding
guilt
or
not
a
felonious
homicide.
and
then
with
a
separate
jury,
you
tried
what
degree
it
was
which
really
determined
the
punishment
then
you
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
prove
provocation
by
a
preponderance
to
the
evidence.
now,
would
you
object
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i
would
think
you
would
find
--
