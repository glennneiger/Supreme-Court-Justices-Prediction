mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
posture
of
the
case
is
changed
considerably
since
the
brief
were
filed
and
i
believe
the
only
issue
which
is
now
disputed
is
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
intervene
in
a
court
martial
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
a
pretrial
discovery
protective
order.
the
background
of
the
case
is
this.
the
appellee
is
an
air
force
master
sergeant
who
was
charged
by
the
air
force
with
first,
conspiring
to
communicate
classified
information
to
an
agent
of
a
foreign
government,
in
this
case
the
soviet
union,
in
violation
of
articles
81
and
134
of
the
code
of
military
justice
and
50
u.s.c.
783
(b).
secondly,
failing
to
obey
an
air
force
regulation
requiring
the
reporting
of
contacts
with
foreign
agents
in
violation
of
article
92
of
the
military
code.
and
third,
violating
134,
the
general
article
by
copying
classified
documents
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
793
(b)
and
attempting
to
deliver
such
documents
to
an
unauthorized
person
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
793
(d).
this
court
martial
was
about
to
commence
when
the
appellee
began
an
action
in
the
district
court
and
that
court
preliminary
enjoined
the
air
force
from
trying
appellee
sergeant
dechamplain
on
any
charges
laid
under
article
134.
i
think
that
aspect
of
the
district
court’s
order
is
now
out
of
this
case
as
i
discover
from
his
counsel’s
brief.
but
secondly,
what
is
in
this
case
is
the
district
court’s
order
that
the
air
force
are
not
to
try
the
dechamplain
on
any
charges
whatsoever
without
granting
full
and
unlimited
access
to
certain
classified
documents.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
in
the
case
and
i
intend
to
address
it.
it
is
not
however
disputed
any
longer.
i
was
called
by
--
on
friday
by
mr.
boudin
who
said
that
he
now
agrees
that
this
court
has
appellate
jurisdiction
and
i
will
say
a
word
on
the
subject
because
of
course
that
is
not
a
subject
to
mr.
boudin
and
i
can’t
take
out
of
the
case,
it’s
necessarily
in
the
case.
but
the
order
which
the
background
is
an
order
for
complete
access
to
15
documents
from
the
sergeant’s
prior
trial
which
are
no
longer
in
this
trial,
the
government
does
not
intend
to
rely
upon
those
documents
as
well
as
to
nine
documents
which
are
in
this
trial.
and
the
military
order
which
the
district
court
found
inadequate
contemplates
that
sergeant
dechamplain
his
military
counsel,
his
civilian
league
counsel,
one
associate,
one
secretary,
a
foreign
policy
expert
chosen
by
him
and
a
classification
expert
chosen
by
him
shall
have
access
to
these
nine
documents,
may
make
notes
but
the
notes
must
be
left
in
air
force
custody.
and
it
may
be
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
district
court
orders
they
may
be
made
available
in
the
court-martial
proceeding
on
these
terms.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
dispute
is
really
about
the
degree
of
freedom.
the
court
martial
allows
in
access
to
these
documents
and
that’s
this
appeal
followed.
now,
as
i
say
134
is
no
longer
in
the
case,
the
general
article
but
appellee
did
raise
the
question
of
this
court’s
appellate
jurisdiction
under
28
u.s.c.
section
1252.
and
we
believe
that
this
court
clearly
has
such
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
discussed
in
the
briefs
and
discussed
it
on
the
merits.
section
1252
provides
direct
review
from
a
district
court
in
any
interlocutory
order
of
any
court
of
united
states
holding
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional
and
this
court
did
hold
article
134
unconstitutional
in
any
civil
action
where
an
officer
employee
of
united
states
is
a
party.
so,
i
think
the
language
of
section
1252
covers
our
case
exactly.
now,
the
argument
appellee
made
before
which
raised
the
issue
was
that
he
said
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
which
he’d
invoked
was
in
fact
faulty
because
a
three-judge
district
court
was
required
to
consider
the
constitutionality
of
article
134.
and
he
then
proposed
that
this
case
go
forward
on
the
merits
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
i
should
point
out
of
course
that
if
a
three-judge
court
was
required
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
have
appellate
jurisdiction
either
except
for
the
purposes
of
the
idlewild
bon
voyage
liquor
corporation
case
cited
in
the
brief
makes
clear
to
say
that
the
three-judge
court
was
required
and
send
it
back
with
instructions
to
convene
such
a
court
but
it
could
not
hear
the
merits.
now,
we’re
not
going
into
a
lot
of
the
argument
we’ve
had
on
this
issue.
i
think
the
central
point
we
agree
upon,
the
appellee
agreed
even
on
its
prior
position
and
we
agreed
that
no
three-judge
district
court
was
required.
if
the
constitutional
question
as
to
the
article
134
was
in
substantial
and
i
think
that
it
was
insubstantial
either
on
the
logic
that
appellee
was
then
using
or
on
the
logic
that
we
were
using.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
no
i
hope
you
find
the
counterpart
in
the
language
but
i
would
assume
that
if
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
there
might
well
be
a
question
about
the
jurisdiction
here,
perhaps
not.
but
i
think
the
easiest
and
shortest
way
to
the
resolution
of
this
issue
is
to
show
that
no
three-judge
district
court
was
required
and
if
the
problem
under
the
most
expensive
reading
of
the
substantial
question.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
quite
correct.
the
appellee’s
argument
on
this
point
before
was
that
they
did
not
convene
a
three-judge
district
court
because
the
average
decision
holding
article
134
unconstitutional
was
the
decision
of
the
dc
circuit
and
therefore
whether
it
was
a
three-judge
court
or
to
single-judge
court
made
no
difference.
it
must
follow
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion.
i
think
if
that’s
true
then
there
was
no
substantial
question
for
a
district
court
to
decide
and
there
is
no
point
in
convening
a
three-judge
district
court
which
must
automatically
a
follow
court
of
appeals’
decision.
our
argument
was
somewhat
different
and
it
was
that
--
there
was
no
substantial
question
because
the
district
court
misunderstood
the
question
before
it.
it
was
not
a
question
about
the
first
two
sections
of
article
134.
it
was
simply
a
question
about
the
third
section
which
is
an
assimilative
crime
statute
and
as
to
which
nobody
claims,
there's
a
problem
with
constitutionality.
so
that
there
was
no
substantial
question
before
the
district
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
district
court
thought
so
and
i
think
it
is
indeed
the
nature
of
the
question
rather
than
the
subjective
perception
of
the
judge
that
determine
his
jurisdiction.
but
perhaps
we
need
not
even
go
as
far
as
your
question
suggest
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
if
one
goes
that
far
it’s
quite
clear
that
there
is
appellate
jurisdiction
in
this
court
and
that
--
as
i
say
that
is
a
subject
no
longer
disputed
by
appellee.
and
of
the
only
question
left
as
i
say
is
the
question
of
district
court
control
of
the
pretrial
discovery
process
of
the
court
martial.
and
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
there
is
no
such
power
in
district
court
to
intervene
at
this
stage
for
that
purpose.
i
think
the
military
justice
system
has
a
freedom
from
intervention
on
such
matter
similar
to
that
that
the
state
justice
systems
have
and
that
intervention
is
justified
only
when
as
younger
against
harris
would
put
it
--
various
bad-faith
or
harassment
and
when
the
party
seeking
relief
is
threatened
with
irreparable
injury
that
is
both
great
in
immediate.
and
this
case,
the
district
court
made
no
such
findings
as
a
precondition
of
its
intervention
and
indeed
bad
faith
or
harassment
were
not
even
alleged.
the
fact
that
the
appellee
might
have
to
be
confined
pending
the
outcome
of
the
military
prosecution
in
any
appeals
that
follow
does
not
constitute,
it’s
not
cognizable
as
an
irreparable
injury
that's
an
incident
of
any
criminal
process.
and
if
that
were
grounds
for
intervention,
federal
courts
would
be
intervening
all
of
the
time
in
state
and
military
justice
appeals
systems.
i
think
the
decision
of
this
court
rather
uniformly
show
that
this
rule
against
intervention
by
article
iii
courts
in
military
proceedings
as
in
state
proceedings
rest
upon
a
cluster
of
policy
factors.
i
think
some
of
them
are
of
constitutional
dimension
and
they’re
summed
up
generally
in
the
word
exhaustion
of
remedies
and
comity.
and
i
think
these
policies
are
so
strong
indeed
that
the
appellee
has
not
been
able
to
point
to
a
single
decision
of
this
court
sanctioning
an
intrusion
like
this
one
into
the
military
justice
system.
it’s
an
intrusion
both
unique
and
as
continuing
because
the
terms
the
district
court’s
order
contain
words
which
must
be
construed
and
the
district
court
could
hold
itself
available
for
application
to
continue
to
supervise
the
access
to
document’s
problem.
and
all
of
that
takes
place
before
the
appellee
has
even
been
tried
much
less
exhausted
his
remedies
within
the
military
justice
system.
now,
let
me
say
here
that
a
great
deal
of
the
argument
in
this
brief
rest
upon
i
think
unjustified
denigration
of
the
military
justice
system.
there
is
much
argument
in
the
brief
in
the
appellee’s
brief
that
military
tribunals
do
not
apply
all
of
the
procedures
that
civilian
tribunals
do
which
is
quite
true
but
that
is
not
a
statement
that
military
tribunals
are
in
anyway
lax
in
applying
those
procedures
which
this
court
and
congress
has
an
appropriate
for
them.
similarly,
i
think
in
an
effort
to
avoid
the
plain
thrust
of
cases
like
gusik
against
schilder
and
younger
against
harris.
the
appellee
has
tried
to
argue
that
any
remedy
he
may
have
in
the
military
system
will
be
futile.
and
that
seems
to
me
a
very
hard
claim
for
a
man
who’s
been
convicted
ones
by
a
court
martial
on
an
espionage
charge
and
has
appealed
that
conviction
and
has
had
it
reversed
by
the
court
of
military
review
and
has
had
that
reversal
sustained
by
the
court
of
military
appeals.
his
real
complaint
is
that
he
has
made
three
successive
petitions
for
extraordinary
relief
prior
to
a
second
trial
and
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
denied
them
and
said
that
that
is
extraordinary
relief
and
is
not
to
be
use
as
a
substitute
for
appeal.
there's
no
reason
here
to
think
that
should
he
be
convicted
upon
a
second
court
martial
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
and
indeed
the
entire
military
appellate
system
would
not
be
fully
sensitive
to
his
constitutional
claims.
i
will
discuss
only
briefly
this
court’s
opinion
in
gusik
against
schilder
which
is
really
a
much
stronger
case
for
intervention
by
article
iii
courts
because
the
man
there
--
the
serviceman
there
had
been
convicted
and
had
exhausted
all
of
his
military
remedies.
afterwards,
a
new
article
gave
him
the
right
to
ask
for
a
discretionary
new
trial
to
be
given
by
the
judge
advocate
general
and
that
was
the
only
remedy
available
to
him
and
his
chances
didn’t
look
very
good,
but
this
court
said
that
habeas
corpus
was
not
available
to
him
until
he
had
exhausted
that
remedy.
it
seems
to
me
that
he
had
a
much
slimmer
chance
and
adequate
remedy
at
law
than
does
the
appellee
here.
the
gusik
case
itself
analogized
the
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
military
remedies
to
the
similar
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
remedies
within
state
court
systems
and
i
guess
younger
against
harris
recently
decided
by
this
court
shows
the
strength
of
that
requirement.
there,
it
was
a
prosecution
of
a
man
under
the
california
criminal
syndicalism
act,
an
act
of
dubious
constitutionality
and
he
raised
the
first
amendment
claim.
it
would
seem
to
me
much
more
compelling
than
the
appellee’s
claim
here
because
his
conduct
alleged
is
espionage
which
does
not
fall
under
any
constitutionally
protected
area.
but
i
think
if
one
analyzes
younger
and
this
case
will
find
them
parallel
in
many
respects,
there
is
here
not
the
policy
of
federalism
which
younger
found
important
but
there
is
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
make
rules
for
the
armed
forces
which
are
separate.
there
is
a
same
document
of
equity
jurisprudence
against
restraining
criminal
prosecutions.
there
is
the
same
adequate
remedy
of
law
and
there's
the
same
absence
of
a
showing
of
irreparable
injury.
there
is
the
same
need
i
think
to
avoid
friction
and
to
avoid
disruption
of
the
court
martial.
i
think
in
considering
this
case,
one
ought
to
consider
what
the
general
principle
at
stake
is.
the
general
principle
is
really
one
that
would
commence
a
general
removal
power
from
courts
martial
for
constitutional
issues.
and
the
court
below
when
appellee
here
say
that
since
military
courts
do
not
have
special
expertise
on
such
issues,
there
is
no
reason
to
let
them
decide
them
without
having
a
federal
court
intervene
to
decide
them
for
them.
that
would
shell
the
cases
back
and
forth
between
the
article
iii
system
and
the
military
system
in
a
way
that
it
would
be
so
disruptive
and
so
costly
for
everybody
concerned.
it
would
be
better
if
the
article
iii
court
simply
took
over
court
martial
rather
than
did
that.
now
the
only
reply,
the
appellee
has
to
all
of
these
occurred
i
think
the
heart
of
his
reply
is
at
page
51
of
his
brief
where
he
strides
a
string
of
cases,
billings
against
truesdell,
toth
against
quarles,
reid
against
covert,
mcelroy
agianst
guagliardo,
and
he
cites
those
for
the
proposition
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
sanctioned
interference
with
on
going
military
proceedings
to
correct
fundamental
of
the
constitutional
errors.
and
i
think
not,
i
think
not
those
are
all
cases
in
which
the
person
seeking
to
have
a
federal
court
intervene
successfully
claimed
not
to
be
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
the
integrity
of
the
military
trial
process
was
not
at
stake
and
the
intervention
to
prevent
the
court
martial
a
person
who
is
not
even
subject
to
military
law
is
hardly
the
same
kind
of
disruption.
in
fact,
those
cases
can
be
decided
by
the
status
of
the
person.
he
is
a
civilian
not
a
military
in
person
and
then
a
further
legal
question
of,
may
a
court
martial
constitutionally
try
a
civilian
under
these
circumstances
which
is
not
all
the
same
of
taking
a
person
who
is
concededly
subject
to
court-martial
jurisdiction
concededly
subject
to
trial
and
constantly
filtering
his
constitutional
claims
out
of
the
military
system
into
the
federal
system
perhaps
for
full
appeal
and
then
back
into
the
military
system
again.
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
that’s
about
all
there
is
to
the
appellee’s
case
that
it
is
a
constitutional
issue
and
therefore
there's
no
reason
why
should
at
the
military
courts
decide
before
the
civilian
courts
do.
and
we’ve
seen
that
the
intention
of
congress
and
all
of
the
policy
considerations
underlying
this
court’s
decisions
run
to
the
contrary.
there
is
one
thing
perhaps
i
should
mention
and
that
is
that
appellees
brief
mounts
in
extents
of
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
of
article
76
of
the
code
which
is
the
finality
provision
and
says
that
it’s
unconstitutional
if
it’s
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
only
collateral
attack
possible
upon
a
military
conviction
is
by
habeas
corpus
by
persons
in
confinement.
that
gets
the
appellee
into
martin
against
hunter’s
lessee
and
ex
parte
mccardle
in
a
very
exciting
group
of
cases
to
teach
but
i
think
not
relevant
for
today’s
discussion.
we
cite
article
76
as
evidence
of
congressional
intent
that
the
court
martial
system
be
generally
free
in
interference,
it
clearly
is
that.
we
have
argued
that
habeas
corpus
is
the
only
permissible
form
of
collateral
attack
but
that’s
not
necessary
for
decision
of
the
present
case
because
whatever
form
of
collateral
attack
maybe
available
younger
against
harris
and
gusik
against
schilder
for
the
proposition
that
it
takes
place
after
the
exhaustion
of
remedies
in
the
military
system.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
there
is
a
comparable
not
a
strong
but
there
is
a
constitutional
value
which
parallels
that
in
congress
as
constitutional
power
provide
special
rules
and
hence
special
courts
for
the
military
and
i
think
all
of
the
policy
reasons
that
are
mentioned
in
younger
against
harris
as
equally
applicable
here
and
i
think
gusik
against
schilder
tends
to
equate
the
two
systems:
state
system
and
the
military
system
in
terms
of
nonintervention
--
premature
intervention
by
federal
courts
by
article
iii
courts.
so
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
policy
of
younger
against
harris
is
fully
applicable
here
and
that
policy
of
course
was
recognized
recently
in
parisi
against
davidson,
a
case
that
appellee
cites
in
that
string
which
it’s
distinguishable
and
which
this
court
takes
particular
pains
to
point
out
that
the
policy
cited
in
gusik
against
schilder
is
not
being
breached.
and
i
might
say,
finally
about
this
point
that
the
appellee
who
is
in
confinement
i
think
has
no
standing
to
raise
the
issue
of
whether
article
76
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
were
applied
to
somebody
who
was
not
in
confinement
to
prevent
him
from
being
habeas
corpus.
that
may
be
an
issue
in
some
case
someday
when
there
is
such
a
person
who
is
blocked
by
article
76
interpreted
that
way
but
i
think
the
appellee
has
no
standing
to
raise
his
case
for
his
purposes
in
this
case.
to
return
to
the
main
point
then
what
we
have
before
us
as
i
say
is
simply
a
question
of
federal
court
--
we
have
before
the
supreme
court
a
question
of
pretrial
discovery
and
a
question
in
a
court
martial
which
hasn’t
taken
place
yet
and
nothing
could
show
more
clearly
what
a
massive
disruption
of
a
court
and
branch
of
military
--
of
justice
we
have
here.
i
think
the
clear
intention
of
congress
in
the
clear
policy
of
the
cases
of
this
court
is
to
let
this
court
martial
go
forward
without
interruption.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
military
tribunals
will
be
insensitive
to
any
of
the
appellee’s
claims
and
should
they
--
all
of
them
decide
against
him
and
incorrectly
he
has
available
habeas
corpus
as
it
does
anybody
wrongfully
convicted
in
another
system
of
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i'm
not
quite
clear
where
it
would
be
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
the
offense
took
place
overseas.
i
don’t
know
how
we
would
solve
the
jurisdictional
problem
if
it
were
not
a
military
took
place
in
thailand.
and
i
am
not
sufficiently
versed
to
say
whether
or
not
we
could
solve
the
jurisdictional
problem
and
get
them
into
a
civilian
article
iii
court.
i
think
that’s
been
tried
before
without
success.
we
think
for
these
reasons
of
the
case
ought
to
be
reversed
in
the
complaint
dismissed.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
as
i
understand
that
appellee
says
that
they
thought
it
was
not
necessary
because
the
three-judge
court
would
be
bound
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
avrech.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
so
that
it
will
have
no
substantial
question
to
decide
in
any
event.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
just
to
make
the
observation
mr.
chief
justice
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
charge
that
anything
in
military
done
has
done
has
not
been
done
in
good
faith
and
that
what
is
being
told
to
us
here
is
that
we
must
take
this
case
in
a
rather
hypothetical
basis
now
and
discuss
the
constitutional
issue
had
we
followed
this
procedural
all
the
way
through.
mr.
--
sergeant
dechamplain’s
original
court
martial
would’ve
been
stopped
while
we
litigate
that
the
use
of
his
statements
in
the
first
court
martial
up
through
this
court’s
and
then
went
back
to
the
court
martial.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
it
is
your
honor
on
a
need
to
know
basis.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
and
the
--
nothing
that
the
documents
used
in
that
original
trial
because
of
the
access
problem
are
not
going
to
be
use
15
that
were
not
going
to
be
use
in
this
trial
and
that
only
nine
documents
are
going
to
be
used
in
this
trial.
my
point
is
simply
is
although
mr.
boudin
complains
about
the
necessity
to
go
up
to
a
court
martial
and
have
an
appeal
and
come
back
and
be
retried.
that
happens
in
many
systems
of
the
justice
and
the
alternative
he
offers
us
is
federal
court
intervention
whenever
the
constitutional
issue
arises
in
a
court
martial.
so
that
you
will
have
massive
disruptions
perhaps
never
complete
these
trials.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
if
the
rule
is,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
no
limitation
of
any
source
upon
the
use
of
notes
is
ever
possible
then
of
course
it
follows
that
more
sensitive
the
material
the
less
possible
it
is
ever
to
prosecute
anybody
because
if
sensible
limitations
can’t
be
use
upon
the
review
with
which
the
documents
flow
to
the
world
and
which
notes
are
allowed
out
to
flows
to
the
world
then
i
think
prosecution
is
often
impossible.
i
regret
that
i
was
not
in
the
ellsberg
case
and
cannot
draw
parallels
between
the
protective
order
there
and
the
protective
order
here
perhaps
the
documents
were
of
different
sensitivities.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
restrictions
as
a
matter
stands
now
sergeant
dechamplain
--
the
military
restrictions
imposed
by
sergeant
dechamplain
his
military
counsel,
his
civilian
league
counsel,
one
associate
i
believe,
one
secretary,
one
foreign
policy
expert
and
one
classification
systems
expert
may
all
have
access
to
the
documents.
they
may
not
take
the
documents
home
with
them,
they
can
work
on
them
under
air
force
with
the
documents
have
remained
in
air
force
custody
in
that
sense.
they
may
work
on
the
documents
there,
they
may
make
notes.
the
notes
if
they
are
sensitive
must
be
left
in
air
force
custody
as
i
understand
it.
i
don’t
think
mr.
boudin
suggested
that
air
force
would
be
reading
his
notes.
i
suppose
that
there
can
be
a
protective
order
worked
out
so
that
doesn’t
happen.
but
there
is
considerable
access
to
these
documents
by
a
counsel,
military
and
civilian
by
the
client
and
by
experts.
now,
it
may
turn
out
ultimately
when
if
this
case
is
tried
and
facts
are
all
developed,
it
may
turn
out
that
some
court
will
think
that
not
an
adequate
access.
i
don’t
think
that
question
and
be
decided
on
this
kind
of
a
record
at
this
time
and
that’s
a
very
strong
argument
against
intervening
--
having
a
federal
court
intervene
to
try
to
solve
it
that
problem
now
before
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
you
can
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
they
can
make
notes
and
i
suppose
the
secretary
can
take
dictation
from
it
if
they
wish
and
write
the
notes
up.
i
suppose
that's
the
reason,
i
suppose
it's
a
--
an
effort
to
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
don’t
know
why
they
negotiated
the
secretary
into
the
deal
mr.
justice
marshall.
