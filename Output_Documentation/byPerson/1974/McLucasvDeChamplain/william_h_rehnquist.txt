justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
appealability
to
district
court’s
orders
to
this
court
is
still
on
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bork,
where
you're
appealing
from
a
judgment
holding
a
federal
statute
unconstitutional
under
1252
you
don’t
find
the
counter
part
of
1253’s
language
where
the
right
to
appeal
turns
on
whether
or
not
three-judge
district
court
was
required,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
johnson
against
zerbst
was
federal
review
of
federal
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mitchum
against
foster
though
held
that
the
civil
rights
act
was
an
exemption
to
that
statute
and
so
it
said
nonetheless
younger
applied
independently
of
the
statute
and
only
younger
applied
in
that
kind
of
a
situation?
