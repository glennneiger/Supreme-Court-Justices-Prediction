justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
what
restrictions
if
any
were
imposed
with
respect
to
the
nine
documents
that
are
to
be
used
in
the
trial?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
appellee,
an
air
force
master
sergeant
was
charged
with
unauthorized
use
of
classified
military
documents
in
violation
of
134
of
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
the
appellee
filed
this
action
in
the
district
court
seeking
to
enjoin
the
impending
court-martial
proceeding.
he
avert
that
article
134
was
unconstitutionally
vague
and
also
that
he
was
denied
due
process
by
the
military
court's
denial
of
access
by
appellee's
civilian
counsel
to
certain
classified
documents.
the
district
court
relying
on
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
granted
a
preliminary
injunction.
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
in
parker
against
levy
and
secretary
of
the
navy
against
avrech
sustained
the
validity
of
article
134.
our
recent
decision
in
schlesinger
against
councilman
also
disposes
of
appellee's
claim
with
respect
to
access
by
his
civilian
counsel
to
the
classified
documents.
as
we
said
in
schlesinger,
when
a
serviceman
is
charged
with
crimes
by
military
authorities
and
can
show
no
harm
other
than
that
attended
upon
resolution
of
his
case
within
in
the
military
court
system,
the
federal
district
courts
must
refrain
from
intervention.
we
accordingly
vacate
the
injunction
and
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court.
mr.
justice
brennan
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
marshall
joined.
