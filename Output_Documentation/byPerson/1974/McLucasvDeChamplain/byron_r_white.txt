justice
byron
r.
white
with
younger
against
harris
as
we
both
know
was
a
premise
to
great
deal
upon
what
the
court
opinion
called
in
capital
letters
--
our
federalism
and
that
(voice
overlap)
that
is
not
an
ingredient
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
i
miss
--
if
i
misrecollected
mr.
boudin
and
maybe
you’ve
mentioned
this
that
in
this
second
proposed
trial
the
government
is
not
going
to
use
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
do
know
that
though
they
are
not
making
the
same
charges.
they
have
eliminated
similar
charges.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
it
is
the
entire,
is
the
entire
record
of
the
first
trial
sealed?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
entire
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
younger
wasn’t
based
on
that
statute
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
have
been?
