mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
agreed
that
the
issue
in
this
court’s
jurisdiction
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
it
for
exactly
the
reason
given
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
while
the
application
of
stratton
and
idlewild
in
principle
could
have
dictated
a
different
result.
it’s
quite
true
that
1252
is
an
ambiguous
and
in
the
thicket
of
three-judge
court
problems
that
have
troubled
the
court
for
so
long
at
least
and
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
if
this
is
an
issue
and
which
should
be
resolve
in
favor
of
the
court’s
jurisdiction.
we
see
three
issues
here
and
the
second
of
which
is
really
not
been
touched
upon
by
my
brother.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
court
martial
judges
refusal
to
give
civilian
defense
counsel
full
access
to
the
prior
trial
record
and
to
the
very
documents
that
other
subject
of
these
criminal
charges
with
the
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
the
effect
of
assistance
of
counsel
going
to
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
martial
under
johnson
against
zerbst
which
we
radically
we
did
not
cite
though
it
seems
the
clearest
case
in
point.
the
second
question
which
is
i
say,
my
brother
did
not
develop
an
argument
with
whether
or
not
any
collateral
review
of
a
court
martial
decision
of
this
kind,
court
martial
action
of
this
kind.
other
than
habeas
corpus
is
permissible
at
some
stage
of
the
proceeding
and
the
third
issue
which
is
really
the
central
issue
as
we
see
it
is
whether
or
not
given
the
circumstances
in
this
particular
case,
the
appropriate
remedy
of
collateral
review
was
by
injunction.
now,
the
issues
have
to
be
decided
in
the
reverse
order
of
that
dealt
with
in
our
brief
and
in
the
government’s
brief
because
the
question
of
collateral
review
and
the
nature
of
it
to
with
is
an
injunction
needed
at
an
early
stage
is
a
function
of
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
right
involved
which
we
discussed
in
point
one,
orally
three
or
five
in
our
brief
a
function
of
that
right
and
of
what
actually
happened
in
this
case.
so
i
turn
to
the
first
issue
namely
the
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
this
is
we
know,
it’s
not
an
abstract
issue.
it
must
be
related
to
the
crime
charged
18
u.s.
793
and
to
the
prior
history
of
this
case.
we
must
remember
that
sergeant
dechamplain
was
arrested
in
july
of
1971
charged
with
a
violation
of
the
espionage
laws
among
other
things
in
having
conspired
to
deliver
a
package
of
25
documents
to
a
russian
agent
in
indochina.
and
that
he
has
been
since
july
3,
1971
in
pretrial
confinement,
in
post-trial
confinement
and
now
in
pretrial
confinement
and
if
the
course
of
events
follows
which
is
suggested
by
the
government
here
he
can
very
well
be
in
three
years
more
confinement
until
this
case
is
finally
adjudicated
again
by
this
court.
now,
as
i
said
the
issue
in
the
case
of
the
effective
assistance
counsel
is
determined
by
the
nature
of
the
case.
there
are
some
problems
that
we
had
in
powell
against
alabama
where
we
know
the
interference
that
occurred
there.
there
are
other
cases
such
as
moore
against
dempsey
where
you
have
a
mob
scene
interfering
with
the
effectiveness
of
a
court.
in
the
present
case,
so
far
as
the
nine
documents
are
concerned
just
to
take
those
away
from
the
prior
trial
record.
we
have
the
--
what
may
probably
he’ll
be
called
the
core
or
the
corpus
delicti
of
the
case.
these
are
the
documents
whose
transmittal
by
conspiracy
or
attempt
is
the
basis
of
the
charges
against
dechamplain.
it
is
these
documents
that
like
any
other
corpus
of
the
crime
whether
it’s
obscenity
book
or
some
other
analogy
that
the
court
may
consider
are
being
restricted
so
far
as
access
are
concerned.
now,
this
would
be
true
in
any
case
as
i
say
in
which
the
very
core
of
the
case
is
being
preventive
from
giving
counsel
full
access.
but
we
have
a
very
special
case
here
and
that
is
the
complexity
of
18
u.s.c.
793,
the
espionage
laws.
your
honors
touched
on
the
problem
without
adequate
or
virtually
any
briefing
several
of
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
united
states
against
new
york
times
or
new
york
times
against
united
states
pentagon
papers
case.
the
supreme
court
--
this
court
has
passed
upon
the
issue
in
garren
where
it
said
that
the
matter
must
be
relate
to
the
national
offense
to
be
a
crime
and
in
united
states
against
hunter,
chief
judge
learned
hand
added
another
dimension
to
the
problem,
increasing
the
complexity
whether
or
not
the
material
and
those
documents
were
in
the
public
domain.
now,
we
had
a
star
example
a
long-winded
and
notorious
example
in
the
ellsberg
case
before
judge
byrne
where
the
most
elaborate
briefing
on
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
793
with
engaged
in
was
the
subject
to
the
very
tentative
decision
by
judge
byrne
and
with
the
subject
of
our
being
given
access
to
the
documents
involved
the
very
top
secret
documents
including
many
that
were
never
given
to
the
new
york
times,
that
were
never
published
anywhere
and
that
government
consistently
insisted,
hence
the
charged
to
the
crime
related
to
the
national
offense.
we
were
given
those
documents
as
your
honors
will
see
from
this
record
here
without
any
limitation
whatsoever
except
the
word
of
counsel
that
the
following
persons
not
disclose
to
the
government
were
entitled
to
those
--
to
examine
those
papers
so
that
they
could
advice
us
as
consultants.
and
so
many
of
them
could
testify
at
the
trial
and
not
only
where
some
20
consultants,
an
experts
testifying
at
the
trial
but
some
40
people
staff
members,
academician,
mimeograph
operators
and
a
whole
core
of
lawyers
more
than
probably
in
any
other
trial
were
given
copies
of
those
papers
--
the
so-called
national
defense
documents.
in
contrast,
the
military
judge
here
whose
decision
is
final
has
said
first
as
your
honors
will
see
from
appendix
61
that
he
doesn’t
think
it
important
that
the
matters
relate
to
national
offense
and
he
will
not
consider
expert
testimony
on
the
subject
strange
ruling
in
light
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
secondly,
the
military
judge
has
says
that
i
may
examine
these
documents
only
in
the
presence
of
a
person
with
security
classification
to
include
defense
military
counsel
assuming
that
i
retain
them
because
it
maybe
that
mr.
dechamplain
and
i
may
decide
to
proceed
alone.
and
with
case
i
will
have
to
have
a
government
security
agents
watch
me
as
i
examine
these
papers.
i
may
not
have
a
copy
of
them.
i
must
examine
them
at
a
“secure”
location.
i
may
not
take
notes
or
to
be
fairer
i
may
take
notes
where
they
have
to
be
read
by
the
government’s
security
people.
now,
this
is
--
in
this
day
under
our
system
of
justice,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
military
establishment,
i
have
a
high
regard
for
it.
i
think
the
u.s.
court
of
military
appeals
and
the
uniformed
system
of
justice
are
a
great
advancement
over
the
days
in
wellington
when
he
referred
to
the
soldiers
are
scum.
great
advancement
but
this
is
what
we
have
today
from
this
military
judge
in
contrast
to
the
whole
procedure.
now,
i
may
say
just
to
add
something
that
the
prosecution
counsel
are
under
those
such
limitation,
they
have
a
whole
record.
they
can
examine
the
whole
prior
record,
the
nine
documents
without
limitation
and
the
15
that
made
up
the
package
of
24.
so,
they
and
the
trial
judges
of
the
government
can
see
these
things
and
i
may
not.
the
suggestion
that
my
military
counsel
may
have
a
recollection
of
what
they
saw
before
or
may
even
reflect
it,
refresh
it
by
looking
at
it.
it
doesn’t
help
because
they're
not
allowed
to
transmit
to
me.
i
note
or
verbalism
the
information
in
these
top
security
documents.
now,
i
will
have
to
contrast
this
with
an
obscenity
case
in
which
its
obvious
counsel
can
course
many
consultants
as
he
wishes
to
and
not
being
restricted
to
two
consultants
and
to
two
lawyers.
i've
selected
and
assisted
in
my
office,
i
may
not
have
my
partner
mr.
rabinowitz.
look
at
these
papers
whatever
his
advantages
over
me
may
be.
so
the
result
is
i'm
restricted
in
number,
i'm
restricted
in
place,
i'm
restricted
in
making
copies
and
the
ellsberg
files
are
still
in
my
office,
i've
examined
them
and
the
national
security
so
far
doesn’t
seem
to
have
been
imperiled.
now,
with
respect
to
the
entire
trial
record,
which
is
a
separate
but
related
point,
the
trial
record
as
i
said
is
available
to
the
prosecution.
we
would’ve
the
right
at
one
time
to
look
at
it
under
article
54
(c)
which
deals
with
appeals
but
that
right
no
longer
exists
here.
these
documents
of
the
15
documents
in
the
prior
trial
record
have
to
be
considered
as
any
lawyer
would
consider
them
in
deciding
to
try
a
second
case.
and
the
fact
of
the
government
decides
that
it
will
remove
in
order
to
keep
me
from
looking
at
them
15
documents,
how
do
we
solve
the
problem?
because
those
documents
may
very
well
be
important
and
the
transcripts
of
the
early
record
may
very
well
to
be
important
for
me
to
decide
not
on
the
advice
of
the
government
or
in
its
judgment,
for
me
to
decide
what
is
exculpatory.
for
example
sergeant
dechamplain,
they
have
and
they
say
that
the
24
documents
to
take
a
hypothetical
thing.
the
24
documents
were
being
taken
overnight
of
people,
that
people
have
taken
it
from
the
national
--
department
of
defense
overnight
for
the
purpose
of
studying
them
and
the
15
happened
to
be
very
innocent
and
that
the
nine
gotten
there
by
error.
i
don’t
know
of
what
am
i
hypothesizing.
the
fact
is
that
under
any
consideration
of
brady
and
what
it
means
and
the
alderman
where
in
many
cases
we
were
dealing
with
things
ancillary
to
the
case.
these
are
the
--
this
is
the
prior
trial
record
of
the
prosecution
of
a
man
who
spent
three
and
a
half
years
in
jail
now
and
promises
than
more.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
government
is
not
going
to
use
them
they
can
look
at
them,
they
may
very
well
rely
upon
what
was
in
the
prior
trial
record
your
honor
is
quite
right
to
determine
how
to
cross-examine
dechamplain.
he
may
want
to
get
out
on
the
witness
stand
and
testify
with
respect
to
the
15
because
these
were
15
separate
entries
this
was
a
package
deal,
it
was
a
conspiracy
with
respect
to
24.
i
don’t
know
what
the
government
is
expurgated
from
the
prior
record.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
they
have
eliminated
some
of
the
documents
and
they
say
that
no
longer
charging
with
respect
to
those
15.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
but
the
15
were
part
of
the
original
conspiracy
and
i
have
a
right
to
direct
myself
to
that
original
conspiracy
which
was
the
basis
of
the
charges
and
to
see
what
there
is
in
the
record
that
they
taken
away.
i
have
to
depend
on
them
to
decide
whether
not
only
the
documents
have
they
removed
it,
they’ve
deleted,
they
say,
all
references
to
the
documents.
as
a
trial
lawyer
or
appellate
lawyer
i'm
not
willing
to
rely
on
the
government’s
decision
as
to
what
was
in
the
prior
record.
and
that
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
sealed
for
the
government,
my
military
counsel
may
look
at
it
but
they
can’t
tell
me
about
it.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
i'm
only
entitled
to
look
at
that
part
of
the
record
which
deals
with
the
nine
documents
in
this
forthcoming
procedure
and
under
the
limitations
involved
and
of
course
i'm
only
allowed
to
show
as
i
indicated
to
a
few
people.
now
this
denial,
if
your
honors
please,
isn’t
a
procedural
matter.
it
doesn’t
go
to
the
weight
of
the
evidence
which
your
honors
will
recall
in
burns
against
wilson.
a
record
that
was
examined
very
carefully
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
accepted
that
very
careful
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
from
reviewing
the
evidence.
this
is
not
a
case
of
military
expertise
as
in
noyd.
this
is
not
even
a
case
of
a
fourth
amendment
right
involved
in
the
schneckloth
against
bustamonte
case
412
u.s.
where
the
court
distinguished
the
fourth
amendment
right
from
the
right
to
a
fair
trial
with
the
assistance
of
counsel.
this
is
not
even
the
right
of
the
case
of
an
inability
to
put
on
a
single
particular
defense
--
the
insanity
one
that
was
referred
to
in
wetzel.
this
is
very
close,
and
i
mean
no
adamant
version
on
counsel
for
the
government.
we’re
dealing
here
rather
with
civilize
society.
this
becomes
a
mask
of
a
trial
when
counsel
is
not
permitted
to
see
the
full
record
of
a
first
trial
that
led
to
his
client’s
conviction
and
where
all
of
these
handicaps
are
placed
upon
counsel.
now,
your
honors
as
i
said
before
at
the
beginning
there
is
one
case
that
i
think
is
critical
here
because
it
states
basic
principle
and
it
was
mr.
justice
black’s
very
early
opinion
in
the
johnson
against
zerbst
case
where
he
said
and
we
now
go
to
the
question
of
when
you
interfere
with
a
court
martial,
a
court’s
jurisdiction
at
the
beginning
of
trial
may
be
lost
in
the
course
of
proceedings
to
the
failure
to
complete
the
court
--
complete
the
court.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
precisely
your
honor
and
it
is
quite
true.
complete
the
court
by
pro
--
but
the
issue
of
jurisdictions
seems
to
be
fundamental.
complete
the
court
by
providing
counsel
for
an
accused
was
unable
to
obtain
counsel
etcetera,
etcetera
and
repeatedly
your
honors
will
see
the
words
where
a
counsel
is
limited
as
handcuffed
one
way
or
the
other
or
counsel
is
isn’t
supplied.
then,
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
affected.
now,
i
will
pass
from
this
point,
passed
over
the
question
of
collateral
review
generally
which
was
very
thoroughly
dealt
within
our
brief
and
turn
to
what
is
the
problem
raised
by
the
solicitor
general
namely
why
injunctive
relief
and
wasn’t
there
in
younger
case.
in
answer
to
that,
i
call
your
honor’s
attention
not
only
to
the
majority
opinion
but
to
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
stewart
concurred
in
by
another
justice
of
the
court,
mr.
justice
harlan
but
limiting
myself
to
the
majority
opinion
or
the
moment.
first,
the
principle
of
federalism
as
your
honor
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
was
i
think
central.
i
think
equally
relevant
in
the
case
was
the
fact
that
there
was
federal
statute,
which
it
didn’t
have
to
decided
an
application
which
govern
the
question
of
injunctions
against
state
courts.
i
think
thirdly
if
we
take
younger
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
the
court
pointed
out
but
it
did
not
mention
the
statute
at
the
beginning
as
an
indication
of
federal
policy.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
right.
that
i
can’t
answer
your
honor
because
i
don’t
know
the
case
but
if
i
may
pursue
the
younger
things,
limiting
myself
for
the
moment
to
younger.
in
the
younger
case,
the
court
did
of
course
leave
open
the
question
of
irreparable
injury
and
i
do
not
think
one
can
read
younger
as
requiring
malice
on
the
part
of
government
to
establish
irreparable
injury.
the
court
in
younger
was
concerned
about
attacking
a
statute
on
its
face
where
you
are
dealing
with
two
problems
as
pointed
out.
one,
it
was
a
statute
and
a
statute
of
another
sovereignty
of
the
states.
and
secondly,
it
was
attacking
on
its
face.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
but
and
the
younger
was
likewise.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
it
tried
to
enjoin
a
trial
on
a
ground
that
a
statute
is
unconstitutional
and
this
court
said
in
the
majority
opinion
that
constitutionality
of
the
combination
of
the
relative
remoteness
of
the
controversy.
the
impact
on
the
legislative
process
of
the
relief
sought
and
above
all
the
amorphous
nature
of
the
required
line
by
nine
analysis
of
the
statute
used.
i'm
quoting
from
the
words
of
this
court
and
the
problems
that
veto
of
a
legislative
process
and
i
point
out
we’re
dealing
here
not
with
the
legislative
process
or
the
tribunal
which
should
not
have
the
same
weight
as
a
state
legislature
and
we
have
nothing
amorphous
about
this.
this
court
knows
now
as
judge
parker
did
below
exactly
the
extent
of
the
ineffectiveness
of
counsel
that
is
predictable
in
this
case
and
as
far
as
irreparable
injury
is
concerned
let
us
consider
what
will
really
happen.
there
has
already
been
a
trial
overturned
very
properly
by
the
u.s.
court
of
military
appeals
for
constitutional
error.
there
will
be
a
second
trial
if
this
court
on
analysis
agrees
with
us
at
this
kind
of
hampering
of
counsel
which
didn’t
exist
in
copeland,
which
didn’t
exist
in
garren,
which
didn’t
exist
in
ellsberg,
which
has
existed
in
no
other
case,
espionage
case.
the
copeland
was
collateral
they
said
before
and
this
kind
of
limitation
upon
what
counsel
can
do
before
a
court
martial
is
improper.
then,
they
will
ultimately
be
a
third
--
a
second
trial
--
a
third
trial
because
that
conviction
will
be
set
aside
and
we’ll
be
back
with
the
third
trial
whatever
new
constitutional
problems
the
government
may
oppose
by
its
behavior.
now,
i
submit
your
honors
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
i
do
not
think
so,
your
honor.
i
rely
on
--–
sorry.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
but
we
also
have
here
the
problem
of
the
constitutional
right
of
the
defendant
and
whether
or
not
he
is
to
be
tried
before
a
tribunal.
moore
against
dempsey,
johnson
against
zerbst
and
i
suspect
the
powell
against
alabama
to
occur
today
this
court
would
recognize
i
think
in
any
of
those
situations
that
an
injunctive
relief
could
be
issued
even
as
against
the
state
court.
your
honors’
opinion,
on
concurring
opinion
younger
against
harris
which
i
remind
your
honor
is
based
upon
a
statute
and
the
concern
of
attacking
a
statute
is
very
different
here
from
the
concern
with
respect
to
a
military
tribunal
or
any
tribunal.
and
your
honor
said,
irreparable
injury
both
great
and
immediate
if
the
statute
were
patently
and
flagrantly
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
that’s
what
your
honor
said
there
in
the
concurring
opinion.
now,
here
we
do
not
have
the
problem
of
a
statute.
we
have
the
problem
of
what
a
military
tribunal
is
going
to
do.
this
brings
me
to
the
point
of
the
relationship
between
military
tribunals
and
federal
courts
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
the
relationship
between
state
courts
and
federal
courts.
a
different
approach
has
been
taken
and
i
think
will
be
taken
or
should
be
taken
by
since
i
may
not
predict
by
this
court
when
we
deal
with
the
question
of
military
tribunals
as
against
state
tribunals.
we
have
to
remember
that
the
states
as
this
court
has
said
and
others
have
said
where
the
original
basic
repositories
of
our
constitutional
rights.
with
all
the
improvements
that
have
occurred
in
military
courts,
they
are
still,
they
still
have
the
military
influence
even
up
to
the
u.s.
court
of
military
appeals.
with
all
of
the
tradition,
this
court
has
said
several
times
in
parisi,
referred
to
by
the
solicitor
general
and
as
said
also
in
noyd
and
elsewhere
and
that
runs
right
through
that
the
line
that
in
terms
of
military
expertise,
the
courts
will
defer
it
to
the
military.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
burns
was
a
recent
case
in
which
the
court
examined
the
record
and
--
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
yes.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
exactly.
exactly
and
in
that
case,
the
court
essentially
agreed
that
there
was
no
merit.
i
don’t
think
the
court
was
right
and
i
stand
by
the
views
expressed
by
mr.
justice
frankfurters’
concurring
opinion
and
by
the
dissenting
justices.
i
refer
your
honor
is
particularly
that
mr.
justice
frankfurters’
concurring
opinion
where
he
adopted
the
view
on
jurisdiction
that
i
have
just
suggested
to
your
honors
that
the
denial
of
counsel
and
those
other
errors
mr.
justice
frankfurter
was
concerned
with
effects
that
jurisdiction
of
a
tribunal.
mr.
leonard
b.
boudin
well,
the
solicitor
general
says
habeas
corpus
is
fine
even
here
but
we
have
just
gone
through
to
trial
and
i
am
suggesting
that
if
collateral
review
is
ever
proper
and
i
will
accept
this
concession
such
as
it
is
that
is
proper.
this
is
the
time
to
have
the
collateral
review
because
our
client
is
presently
in
present,
he
didn’t
have
that
younger
against
harris.
our
client
has
gone
through
one
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
right.
our
client
will
if
your
honors
agree
and
i
think
your
honors
will
on
this
substantive
issue
we
are
going
into
a
trial
and
knowing
that
the
tribunal
does
not
have
jurisdiction
if
you
accept
my
premises.
and
we
are
going
to
have
a
third
trial
and
we've
been
denied
the
relief
by
the
army
from
imprisonment
even
pretrial
imprisonment
under
their
system
and
a
district
court
in
a
case
which
we
have
appealed
has
affirmed
to
district
judges’
decision
even
though
there’s
no
danger
of
a
client
disappearing.
so,
for
these
reasons,
i
submit
to
your
honor
that
if
you
agree
that
these
limitations
on
counsel
unknown
to
any
civilian
court,
federal
or
state
without
precedent
at
all
dealing
with
the
core
of
the
case,
dealing
with
the
most
complexes
statutes,
weeks
was
spent
in
preparing
the
proposed
charges
for
judge
byrne
in
the
ellsberg
case
on
when
793
applies
and
bearing
in
mind
the
military
judge
statement
that
all
of
these
is
irrelevant
despite
garren,
despite
heine.
i
submit
that
if
there
is
a
case
in
our
universe
in
which
an
injunction
is
the
proper
remedy
and
sometimes
it
is
the
proper
remedy
this
case
against
a
military
judge
not
a
statute,
not
a
state
court
this
case
against
the
military
judge
it
calls
for
the
injunctive
relief
we
have
sought.
i
thank
you,
your
honor.
