justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
wouldn't
dispute
would
you
that
if
the
juvenile
judge
dismissed
the
charges
after
this
hearing
and
found
them
in
effect
not
guilty
but
then
he
couldn't
be
tried
as
an
adult
on
the
same
charge.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
your
court
put
that
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
constitution
of
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
question
hypothecated
that
he
was
in
adult
court
just
as
he
is
in
your
actual
case
but
the
difference
was
that
that
he'd
been
acquitted
of
the
juvenile
charges.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
it
the
one
that
commences
that
the
initiative
of
the
defendant
either,
the
way
it
did
in
price
or
in
green.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
kind
of
evidence
admissible
at
the
fitness
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
counsel
for
the
juvenile
then
offer
evidence
of
mitigating
circumstances?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
be
technically
a
transfer
as
a
part
of
the
juvenile
process,
it
would
be
the
district
attorney
filing
de
novo
in
the
superior
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
richard

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
something
of
a
burden
in
counties
like
the
crr
counties
and
places
where
you
only
have
one
superior
court
judge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
statistics
as
to
the
percentage
of
total
juvenile
cases
and
the
percentage
of
--
in
those
that
have
transfer
hearings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
rather
than
where
they
have
the
hearing,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
kepner
though,
the
person
had
been
found
innocent
originally,
hadn't
he?
