chief

e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
1995,
breed
against
jones.
mr.
iungerich,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
made
a
point
in
your
brief
i
belief
that
if
you
do
not
prevail,
this
will
compel
the
juvenile
courts
to
superimpose
on
the
present
procedural
structure,
a
preliminary
hearing
of
some
kind
in
every
case
that
will
overburden
an
already
overburdened
court
but
isn't
it
possible,
that
is
the
point
you
make
us
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
possible
recently
to
identify
in
advance
the
cases
which
might
be
borderline
adult
cases
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
preliminary
treatment
only
to
those
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
know
the
man
is
right
but
before
he
begins
any
proceeding,
you
know
what
his
prior
record
is,
don't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
know
the
nature
of
the
crime
or
criminal
conduct
that
he's
charged
with?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
do
you
tell
me
that
you
couldn't
identify
in
very
large
percentage
of
the
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
percentage
--
what's
the
percentage
of
cases
that
are
transferred
for
adult
trial,
did
you
know?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
walker.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
preliminary
inquiry
could
not
even
hear
about
the
nature
of
the
crime
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
about
the
point
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
gentlemen,
we
can
resume
arguments
in
breed
against
jones.
mr.
walker,
you
have
22
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
this
fitness
hearing,
is
the
juvenile
not
going
to
be
reticent
about
discussing
the
details
of
his
conduct
for
fear
if
he
does
discuss
it,
it
will
lead
to
his
transfer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
a
very
great
likelihood
more
than
a
possibility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
thinks
that
the
truth
of
the
matter
will
have
an
adverse
impact
on
the
judge
in
terms
of
making
the
decision
to
send
him
to
an
adult
court.
if
he
is
either
very
bright
or
well
advised,
he's
not
going
to
talk,
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
the
decision
on
fitness
has
been
made.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
walker.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
also
for
announcement
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
73-1995,
breed
against
jones.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
vacated
and
remanded.
