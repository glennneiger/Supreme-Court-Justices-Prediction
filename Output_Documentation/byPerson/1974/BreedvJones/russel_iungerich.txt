mr.
russel
iungerich
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
a
federal
habeas
corpus
action
brought
by
award
of
the
california
youth
authority
who
is
currently
in
constructive
custody
on
parole.
it
presents
into
court
in
question
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
to
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
question
is
whether
a
juvenile
such
as
the
respondent
jones
is
placed
twice
in
jeopardy
when
the
juvenile
court
orders
his
trial
as
an
adult
after
an
adjudication
of
delinquency
and
upon
a
finding
that
he's
unfit
for
treatment
as
a
juvenile.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
not
in
dispute.
in
a
petition
filed
in
the
los
angeles
county
superior
court,
respondent
jones
was
charged
with
the
commission
of
an
act
which
if
committed
by
an
adult
would
have
constituted
a
robbery
under
california
law.
at
a
jurisdictional
or
adjudicatory
hearing
on
this
petition,
respondent
jones
was
found
to
have
committed
the
robbery
alleged
in
that
petition.
we
submit
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
to
the
court
that
we
treat
this
particular
proceeding
as
a
trial
and
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
of
our
agreement
between
the
parties
on
that
point
that
the
jurisdictional
or
adjudicatory
hearing
is
in
every
sense
a
court
trial.
after
this
adjudicatory
or
jurisdictional
hearing,
a
second
hearing
was
held
known
as
the
dispositional
hearing
and
at
this
hearing,
the
juvenile
court
had
what
amounts
to
four
choices
under
california
law.
he
could
place
the
juvenile
on
probation.
he
could
commit
the
juvenile
to
a
juvenile
institution
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
juvenile
court,
in
other
words,
a
county
camp
for
juveniles
on
one
of
the
other
county
facilities
available
to
a
juvenile.
he
could
order
a
commitment
to
the
california
youth
authority
or
he
could
do
what
he
did
in
this
case,
exercise
his
power
under
welfare
and
institutions
code
section
707
and
that
is
transfer
the
case
to
the
adult
court
for
trial
of
the
juvenile
as
an
adult.
mr.
russel
iungerich
all
four
alternatives
are
within
his
discretion
under
california
law
although
they
occur
in
separate
divisions
of
the
code
of
the
welfare
and
institutions
code.
mr.
russel
iungerich
it's
18
at
this
time,
yes
your
honor.
i
believe
it
was
21
at
the
time
the
statute
was
amended
subsequent
to
this
particular
juvenile's
transfer
but
he
was
17
at
the
time
of
his
transfer.
mr.
russel
iungerich
well,
i
believe
up
until
age
26
depending
on
whether
or
not
there
is
a
--
ultimately
a
proceeding
under
the
--
if
he
was
committed
to
the
youth
authority
and
he
was
ultimately
came
back
at
age
21
and
was
found
that
he's
still
constituted
a
danger
to
society
under
the
particular
sections
involved
in
the
youth
authority,
he
could
technically
be
committed
up
until
age
26,
i
believe
at
that
time.
mr.
russel
iungerich
what
type
of
hearing
is
the
transfer
hearing?
well
basically,
i
think
that
transfer
hearing
is
set
out
in
the
case
of
jimmy
h.
in
other
words,
there
are
number
of
factors
to
be
considered.
the
first
factor,
of
course
the
factor
that's
expressly
precluded
is
just
taking
a
look
at
the
gravity
of
the
offense
alone.
california
statute
expressly
provides
that
that
alone
is
not
enough
for
transfer.
what
the
judge
will
look
at
are
three
factors
under
the
jimmy
h.
case
and
those
three
factors
are,
first,
he
takes
a
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
that
is
involved
and
the
circumstances
of
the
offense,
the
circumstances
that
surround
the
offense
in
the
particular
case.
he
also
takes
a
look
at
the
juvenile's
prior
conduct.
in
other
words,
any
of
his
behavior
pattern
whether
or
not
as
in
this
case
he
had
committed
prior
crimes
that
came
within
the
juvenile
court
jurisdiction.
in
this
case,
respondent
jones
had
committed
two
prior
armed
robberies.
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes,
your
honor.
hence,
providing
all
the
california
juvenile
court
proceedings
and
of
course
that
isn't
the
mandate
of
course
as
we
would
read
the
combination
of
gault
and
kent.
in
addition
to
looking
at
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
case,
of
course
he's
going
to
look
at
the
minor's
degree
of
sophistication
would
be
the
third
factor
and
his
--
the
extent
of
his
criminal
involvement
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
russel
iungerich
are
there
findings
here?
mr.
russel
iungerich
well,
the
findings
are
not
normally
formally
made.
in
other
words,
in
the
sense
of
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
lost
such
as
you'd
have
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
basically,
the
report,
the
probation
report
if
it's
held
at
the
end
of
the
transfer
hearing
as
in
this
case
is
before
the
judge.
he
has
the
testimony
and
at
that
point
he
makes
his
decision
and
he
may
state
the
factors
that
guide
him
as
far
as
transfer.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
express
requirement
in
california
law
that
all
those
factors
be
placed
on
the
record
at
the
present
time.
mr.
russel
iungerich
well,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
in
this
case
as
far
as
the
disposition
hearing.
the
findings
were
that
the
primary
reason
that
he
felt
that
this
man
should
be
transferred
was
the
fact
that
he
had
committed
two
other
armed
robberies.
that
he
had
been
committed
to
juvenile
institutions
in
both
of
those
cases
and
that
basically,
he
wasn't
amenable
to
the
juvenile
court
process
for
that
reason.
i
think
it's
a
clear
case
of
non-amenability
as
under
any
standard
that
would
be
applied
in
that
type
of
hearing.
mr.
russel
iungerich
if
there
was
a
dispute
of
fact,
i
would
assume
that
the
judge
would
state
his
reason
as
to
why
he
was
finding
one
way
or
another
but
under
the
california
rules
as
this
would
come
up
appeal
of
course.
if
there
was
evidence
on
the
record
that
would
support
the
ultimate
result
that
the
judge
reached,
then
of
course
those
implied
findings
would
be
what
the
california
court
would
rely
on
in
that
situation.
i
think
though
that
basically,
the
point
that
you
brought
out
here
is
one
that
i
think
is
very
important
as
far
as
consideration
the
nature
of
the
question
involved
here.
basically,
what
double
jeopardy
means
in
this
particular
--
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
is
that
a
hearing
is
foreclosed
at
any
point
except
prior
to
the
adjudicatory
hearing
on
the
question
of
transfer
and
the
question
that
really
come
--
the
double
jeopardy
issue
really
is
determinative
of
as
whether
or
not
the
state
should
be
permitted
the
flexibility
to
have
the
hearing
either
before
or
after
and
i
think
arguments
can
be
made
for
a
preferential
--
for
a
preference
one
way
or
another
depending
upon
the
individual
case.
i
submit
that
where
you
have
a
serious
felony
as
robbery
or
murder
or
rape,
you
have
a
likelihood
a
contest
of
fact
and
although
technically
we're
not
consider
quilt
or
innocence
at
the
transfer
hearing.
nevertheless,
the
judge
is
going
to
want
to
know
the
facts
involved
in
this
--
the
questions
will
need
to
go
into
the
same
question
of
fact
that
would
be
involved
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
what?
mr.
russel
iungerich
no,
that
has
been
expressly
ruled
out
that
you
can't
make
the
determination
in
one
proceeding.
what
we
do
is
we
save
the
possibility
of
having
three
proceedings
and
we
only
have
two
if
we
permit
the
alternative,
the
disposition
or
alternative
of
allowing
transfer
after
trial.
basically
what
you
have
if
you
don't
have
the
disposition
or
alternative
after
trial,
what
were
the
advantage
of
the
disposition
or
alternative
if
there
are
contested
issues.
as
to
minor's
involvement
in
the
crime,
as
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
his
involvement
in
the
crime.
those
usually
will
be
brought
before
the
judge
at
the
adjudicatory
hearing
and
he
can
rely
on
what
he
learned
at
the
adjudicatory
hearing
to
shorten
the
process
when
it
comes
before
him
on
disposition.
whereas,
if
you
hold
this
hearing
before,
you
may
have
actually
two
duplicate
trials,
both
of
which
covering
the
same
subject
matter
and
as
is
conceded
by
all
parties
in
this
case
as
we
agreed,
it
would
in
that
situation
if
you
hold
it
prior,
you
will
require
two
judges
because
of
the
judge
that's
considering
the
information
that
comes
in,
in
the
social
study
which
is
the
equivalent
of
the
social
--
of
the
probation
report
that
a
criminal
judge
would
receive
its
sentencing.
he
would
have
many
of
the
hearsay
materials
that
are
presented
in
the
probation
report
that
might
influence
him
on
the
question
of
sentencing
and
its
felt
they
should
not
then
preside
on
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence
having
heard
that
matter
so
you
have
to
have
two
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes,
it's
in
the
sense
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
much,
it
would
be
tantamount
to
a
sentence
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
in
other
words,
if
he
were
committed
to
the
youth
authority
or
he
were
sent
to
a
juvenile
institution.
we
didn't
have
that
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
that's
the
important
factor
that
indicates
why
we
don't
have
an
application
--
a
proper
application
or
proper
case
for
the
application
of
the
principle
of
double
jeopardy
in
this
case
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes.
i
think
quite
clearly
that
that
is
the
position
the
california
court.
i
don't
recall
whether
in
bryan
versus
superior
court
which
is
the
leading
case.
bryan
held
that
there
is
no
violation
of
double
jeopardy
to
allow
this
transfer
to
take
place
after
the
adjudicatory
hearing,
bryan
cited
in
our
brief.
i
do
not
recall
whether
bryan
went
off
on
california
grounds
and
i
don't
think
they
did
discuss
the
california
constitution
although
that
option
was
available
to
the
court
in
applying
--
in
deciding
the
constitutional
question
before
it.
but
basically,
the
rule
in
california
today
is
that
the
hearing
may
be
held
either
before
or
after
and
double
jeopardy
really
comes
down
to
the
question,
must
it
be
limited
only
before
under
the
constitutional
compulsion
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
submit
that
that
question
indicate
--
the
resolution
of
that
question
really
turns
on
the
fact
that
although
respondent
gary
steven
jones
was
tried
twice
in
this
particular
case
and
i
submit
that
the
submission
on
the
preliminary
transcript
of
the
adult
case,
he
was
in
effect
tried
twice
and
that
is
the
equivalent
of
a
trial
under
california
law
because
the
judge
determined
all
the
issues
of
fact
based
on
the
preliminary
transcript.
nevertheless,
although
he
was
tried
twice,
he
was
not
placed
in
jeopardy
twice
and
i
think
the
critical
distinction
here
is
what
is
the
critical
question
is
what
is
a
jeopardy
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
because
even
if
jeopardy
had
attached
to
the
point
of
transfer
and
even
if
double
jeopardy
applied
in
the
extent
of
saying
that
jeopardy
does
attach
in
the
juvenile
court,
respondent
jones
was
not
placed
twice
in
jeopardy
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case
for
the
primary
reason
first
that
none
of
the
policies
behind
neither
the
protections
that
the
--
are
incorporated
in
the
double
jeopardy
provision
were
violated
in
this
case.
north
carolina
versus
pierce,
those
protections
were
set
out.
the
first
was
that
double
jeopardy
protects
against
the
second
prosecution
after
acquittal
and
of
course
i
think
subsumed
in
that
ground
is
also
what
is
tantamount
to
acquittal,
the
dismissal
at
some
point
prior
to
acquittal
where
there
isn't
manifest
necessity
for
the
dismissal
and
the
termination
of
the
case.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
acquittal.
there
was
nothing
tantamount
if
anything
what
we
had
here
was
something
that
was
tantamount
to
a
conviction
without
a
sentence
and
there's
never
been
a
situation
where
the
court
has
held
that
it
--
where
there
actually
has
not
been
a
termination
of
proceedings,
that
there
was
actually
a
jeopardy
at
a
first
jeopardy
at
that
point
and
the
commencement
of
a
second
jeopardy
where
you
do
have
some
sort
of
continuum.
mr.
russel
iungerich
well,
under
california
law
of
course,
under
richard
m.
versus
superior
court,
we
are
bound
under
our
state
law
by
that
principle.
in
other
words,
that
their
jeopardy
would
attach
and
that
you
couldn't
retry
him
if
it
had
been
dismissed
after
the
--
after
the
adjudicatory
hearing
had
commenced.
mr.
russel
iungerich
that
i
think
is
on
the
basis
of
both
the
federal
and
the
state
constitution
and
its
clearly
on
the
basis
of
the
state
constitution
as
well
and
it
does
constitute
an
adequate
state
law
ground
on
that
particular
situation
so
we're
really
not
concerned
with
that
point
as
to
whether
or
not
double
jeopardy
is
applicable
in
juvenile
court
proceedings
per
se
in
this
case
because
the
situation
involved
here
is
really
a
bent
on
question.
we're
talking
about
the
rights
of
this
juvenile
when
he
gets
to
the
point
that
he
is
actually
in
adult
court.
in
other
words,
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
he
is
in
adult
court
and
he
had
been
acquitted
of
the
juvenile
charge.
in
other
words,
what
the
district
attorney
has
done
in
this
case
is
refilled
against
him
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
--
in
a
subsequent
case?
mr.
russel
iungerich
well,
i
think
that
i
would
reserve
that
question
until
a
future
case
because
i
think
there
may
be
some
cases
pending
on
this
court's
docket.
at
this
point,
i
would
think
that
jeopardy
at
least
as
far
as
what
this
court
might
say
would
have
attached
in
the
lower
proceeding
but
i
think
that's
a
quite
different
case
from
ours
because
we
don't
have
that
problem
here
and
i
think
the
states
that
has
statutes
that
permits
that
at
least
ought
to
be
allowed
to
defend
that
in
this
forum
without
my
conceding
away
their
cases
where
we
don't
have
that
problem
involved
in
california.
mr.
russel
iungerich
it's
dismissed,
it
would
be
a
dismissal.
mr.
russel
iungerich
i
--
if
it's
dismissed?
no,
under
the
authority
of
the
case
of
richard
m.
versus
superior
court.
mr.
russel
iungerich
that's
a
constitutional
rule
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
under
our
state
constitutional
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
and
federal.
it
was
predicated
on
both
grounds.
mr.
russel
iungerich
under
california
law,
jeopardy
attaches
and
the
juvenile
court
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
it
isn't
that
it
doesn't
attach
that
even
if
it
does
attach,
we
don't
have
a
violation.
mr.
russel
iungerich
there's
never
been
any
end
to
the
jeopardy.
there's
no
new
jeopardy
when
he's
transferred
to
the
adult
court.
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
russel
iungerich
right,
correct
your
honor.
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes
your
honor.
he
will
have
a
second
opportunity
really
in
this
case.
what
we
have
is
a
situation
where
the
juvenile
is
given
an
opportunity
for
two
adjudications
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
two
opportunities
for
acquittal
and
the
state
loses
the
conviction
in
effect
that
they
obtained
in
juvenile
court
and
has
put
at
risk
again
in
adult
court
of
obtaining
another
conviction
by
the
standard
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
difference
between
the
proceedings
of
course
and
the
reason
why
we
have
to
conduct
a
second
adult
trial
is
that
all
of
the
basic
rights
that
are
recorded
to
an
adult
criminal
defendant
have
not
been
incorporated
into
the
juvenile
court
process,
particularly
under
mckeiver,
the
right
of
jury
trial
and
in
order
to
accord
the
juvenile
that
those
rights
before
he
is
actually
convicted
in
adult
court,
we
have
to
give
him
the
second
adult
trial
as
california
views
the
constitution.
but
i
think
the
important
point
here
is
that
in
analyzing
the
protections
of
the
constitution
that
we
have
no
--
of
double
jeopardy
and
the
protections
that
it
gives,
really,
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
if
any
of
the
protections
that
are
mentioned
in
north
carolina
versus
pearce
apply,
it
would
have
to
be
the
protection
against
a
second
conviction.
but
i
think
that
basically
the
language,
the
understanding
of
that
i
have
of
the
protection
against
a
second
conviction
is
this,
that
you
actually
have
to
have
two
separate
and
distinct
risks
of
punishment
and
in
this
case
there
is
one
risk
of
punishment
throughout.
when
the
petition
was
filed
in
juvenile
court
proceedings,
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
case
in
california,
the
petition
--
the
respondent
was
under
--
on
notice
that
the
possibility
of
transfer
and
the
possibility
of
an
adult
criminal
sentence
was
in
that
case
and
until
he
was
actually
committed
to
the
facilities
of
the
juvenile
court
that
risk
did
not
depart
the
case,
all
at
the
point
that
the
case
is
transferred,
the
only
thing
that
departs
the
case
is
not
the
higher
risk
of
punishment
that's
involved
in
the
adult
criminal
proceedings
but
the
lesser
punishments
that
would
be
involved
or
the
lesser
disposition
of
being
kept
in
juvenile
court.
its
really
what
you
might
say
is
the
converse
of
the
green
situation
in
green
versus
united
states
where
there
in
the
initial
case
there
was
a
verdict
of
guilty
with
regard
to
second-degree
murder
which
meant
an
implicit
acquittal
of
first-degree
murder.
there
after
the
state
tried
to
retry
green
for
first-degree
murder
unless
held
that
there
was
some
type
of
implicit
acquittal,
you
could
not
be
retried
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
for
the
higher
crime.
we
have
a
converse
situation
here
that
the
higher
penalty
never
departed
the
situation.
there
is
no
new
risk
of
punishment
involved
because
the
same
risk
carried
on
throughout.
mr.
russel
iungerich
certainly,
there
is
a
different
consequence
to
the
conviction
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
the
custody
will
be
different
--
well,
it
can
be
the
same
as
in
this
case
because
what
actually
happened
was
the
adult
court
decided
to
use
the
facilities
again
of
the
california
youth
authority
and
its
possible
to
both
juvenile
court
and
adult
court
may
use
that
commitment
to
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
they
certainly.
they
could
have
put
him
on
a
state
prison.
mr.
russel
iungerich
certainly,
but
i
think
that
that
is
basically
a
question
of
policy
for
the
state
courts
to
determine.
after
all,
a
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
it
is
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
it
has
different
consequences.
mr.
russel
iungerich
and
there
are
certainly
collateral
consequences
that
are
involved
that
with
a
criminal
conviction
that
are
not
involved
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
he
has
been
tried
twice.
mr.
russel
iungerich
that
is
correct.
mr.
russel
iungerich
not
double
punishment.
mr.
russel
iungerich
mr.
justice
white,
he
has
to
be
exposed
at
two
different
times
to
separate
indistinct
possibilities
of
punishment.
mr.
russel
iungerich
is
not
enough.
mr.
russel
iungerich
i
do
not
think
we're
settled
with
that
type
of
an
argument
your
honor.
i
would
not
make
that
and
take
that
position.
i
don't
think
that
the
idea
of
continuing
jeopardy
could
be
extended.
in
other
words,
we've
made
a
policy
decision
i
think
and
our
constitutional
law
in
this
country
that
after
a
man
has
been
acquitted,
he
cannot
be
tried
again.
we
do
not
have
an
acquittal
in
this
situation,
however,
when
we
need
to
have
that
type
of
finality.
what
we're
really
talking
about
is
a
separate
type
of
court
system
which
is
a
juvenile
court
system
which
is
basically
making
a
determination
whether
or
not
this
juvenile
should
actually
not
be
treated
as
an
adult
and
because
of
its
nature
of
his
crime
and
his
prior
background,
they
feel
that
in
order
to
rehabilitate
him,
he
actually
needs
to
be
exposed
to
the
criminal
process
because
they
have
exhausted
their
facilities.
we
have
i
think
quite
different
policy
considerations
here
than
would
be
involved
in
a
situation
where
you
have
a
case
where
a
man
has
been
acquitted
at
a
previous
time.
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes.
mr.
russel
iungerich
well,
frankly
that's
not
our
case.
i
--
we're
not
advocating
that
position.
we're
advocating
only
at
the
disposition
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
well,
at
that
point,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
that
there's
a
different
question,
of
course,
as
to
whether
or
not
when
they
make
a
final
--
i
would
say
under
my
theory
where
you
have
a
separate
risk
of
punishment,
you
have
two
separate
and
distinct
jeopardy
at
that
point
because
you
haven't
had
the
lower
--
you
have
actually
committed
the
man
to
the
juvenile
institution,
if
you've
made
a
mistake,
i
think
the
policy
of
finality
which
is
inherent
in
the
juvenile
--
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
should
apply
at
that
point
and
say,
well,
we
can't
sentence
the
man
a
second
time
and
i
think
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
what?
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes.
mr.
russel
iungerich
the
only
exception
i
think
that
there
might
be
for
that
is
there
is
the
tentative
commitment
to
the
youth
authority
where
the
man
may
be
referred
back
to
the
court.
in
other
words,
it's
really
an
extension
of
the
disposition
hearing.
at
that
point,
in
california,
the
youth
authority
makes
an
evaluation
of
the
man
and
they
decide,
well,
they
don't
feel
they
can
treat
him
and
they
can
send
him
back
to
juvenile
court
at
that
point
very
much
similar
to
diagnostic
studies
that
aid
the
court
in
sentencing.
mr.
russel
iungerich
under
that
at
that
point,
bryan
says
we
can
transfer
him
under
our
law.
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russel
iungerich
well,
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
well,
i
don't
think
it
is
clearly
a
case
that
you
can
identify,
you'd
possibly
identify
them
but
you
have
to
have
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes,
the
probation
department
undoubtedly
would
have
his
prior
record.
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes
your
honor.
well,
mr.
russel
iungerich
well,
the
problem
is
not
identifying.
i
think
you
can
possibly
spot
the
transfer
case
and
specially
where
you
got
a
murder
or
a
robbery,
usually
the
gravity
of
the
offense
even
tells
you
something
about
that
although
we're
not
suppose
to
transfer
on
that
basis.
we're
talking
about
those
that
this
--
any
attorney
where
to
sought,
when
he
comes
in
to
transfer
hearing,
he's
going
to
want
to
fully
trash
out
all
of
the
issues
as
to
why
his
client
should
not
be
transferred
and
if
he
does
that,
what
we're
getting
off
is
really
two
trials
and
i
think
that
that's
the
important
point
to
make
that
there
are
situations
where
the
juvenile
court
judge
should
have
the
discretion
to
hear
the
adjudication
phase
first
and
then
make
his
decision
on
transfer
afterward
to
avoid
two
duplicate
trials
before
two
different
judges
because
what
we're
doing
by
applying
double
jeopardy
in
this
case
to
cut
off
transfer
as
a
dispositional
alternative
will
in
effect
take
that
discretion
away
from
the
judge
so
that
he
can
maintain
his
calendar
and
take
those
cases
where
he
thinks
that
he's
going
to
have
two
contested
hearings
and
may
have
a
situation
involving
two
full
trials
before
two
different
judges
and
try
them
at
one
proceeding.
mr.
russel
iungerich
the
percentage,
it
is
less
than
10%
and
i
--
the
exact
figure
at
this
point,
i
don't
know
because
our
figures
are
--
the
last
figures
we
had
available
of
course
are
1972
figures
and
the
bureau
of
criminal
identification
in
california
hasn't
come
up
with
its
reports
for
73
yet
but
at
that
point
it
was
less
than
10%.
the
point
is,
with
those
cases
though
is
that
the
ones
that
are
considered
for
transfer
and
we
don't
know
how
many,
first
of
all,
there
are
no
statistics
on
the
number
of
waiver
hearings
that
are
actually
held
in
california.
where
transfer
is
rejected
and
of
course
those
are
the
cases
that
are
really
going
to
cause
the
bottleneck
for
the
juvenile
court
because
where
transfer
is
rejected
that's
the
situation
where
we're
going
to
have
the
second
trial
situation
in
the
juvenile
court
and
actually
the
problem
created
for
the
juvenile
court
calendar.
i
think
there's
no
question,
the
both
sides
on
this
case
agree
on
the
fact
that
the
juvenile
courts
already
have
overcrowded
dockets
and
by
adding
this
particular
--
taking
out
this
possibility
of
giving
the
flexibility
to
actually
avoid
two
duplicate
trials
in
this
circumstance
may
really
cut
in
to
their
discretion
and
actually
lead
to
more
congestion
on
their
calendars.
i
think
that
as
well
as
the
indication
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
principles
of
double
jeopardy,
i
think
as
well
the
continuing
jeopardy
exception
would
give
us
an
additional
peg
on
which
to
decide
that
this
case
does
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
provision
of
the
constitution.
in
price
versus
georgia,
this
held
that
its
prior
cases
had
formulated
a
concept
of
continuing
jeopardy's
--
jeopardy
where
criminal
proceedings
against
the
accused
have
not
run
their
full
course
and
i
think
in
this
case,
the
proceedings
against
this
individual
did
not
run
their
full
course
until
he
actually
went
to
adult
court
and
there
was
a
determination
and
an
ultimate
disposition.
unlike
any
other
care,
there
is
a
link
between
these
two
proceedings
and
the
link
is
the
judicial
transfer.
it's
not
a
transfer
that
the
prosecution
can
unilaterally
determine
as
for
example,
filing
a
new
case
against
this
man
after
the
juvenile
court
has
taken
him
into
its
own
facilities.
mr.
russel
iungerich
i
--
it
doesn't
commence
that
the
initiative
of
the
defendant
i
would
submit
that
as
the
footnote
in
green,
i
mean
in
price
indicates
that
actually
you
have
an
amalgam
of
interest
in
the
double
jeopardy
cases
but
i
don't
think
that's
its
ever
been
a
preeminent
type
of
thing
where
you
require
a
waiver
other
than
i
think
the
retrial
cases.
even
the
retrial
cases,
i
don't
think
uniformly
go
off
on
the
question
of
waiver
and
indeed
i
think
green
rejected
the
waiver
theory
in
its
analysis.
so
that
i
think
that
it
depends
on
the
particular
case
as
to
which
one
of
those
interests,
lack
of
finality
or
limited
waiver
or
the
interest
of
society,
which
one
of
those
is
actually
applied
in
the
case.
what
i
would
submit
is
continuing
jeopardy
is
not
a
principle
that
can
be
solely
limited
to
the
retrial
case.
the
genius
of
our
common
law
is
that
we
can
apply
a
principle
in
one
area
over
to
a
situation
in
another
area
where
substantially
the
same
policy
considerations
are
valid.
and
i
think
that's
the
situation
we
have
here
with
continuing
jeopardy
because
the
proceedings
did
not
run
there
full
course
until
we
have
this
adult
proceedings
against
mr.
jones
in
this
case.
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russel
iungerich
under
the
new
death
penalty
statutes
in
california,
i
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
i
don't,
i
think
that
was
the
exclusive
--
what
we
do
at
bifurcated
trials
in
the
insanity
area.
in
other
words,
in
insanity,
you
will
have
a
separate
trial
on
your
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
as
separate
trial,
so
your
honor
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
russel
iungerich
to
hold
two
trials
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
--
in
that
situation?
mr.
russel
iungerich
i
don't
ever
recall
that
there
was
although
i
--
there
has
been
some
district
court
attacks
that
a
fifth
penalty
trial
or
something
like
that
constitute
a
double
jeopardy.
but
--
mr.
russel
iungerich
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
that
system
is
not
quite
the
same
situation
as
we
have
here
because
we're
not
talking
about
--
well,
it
may
well
be
because
you
have
a
conviction
and
then
a
sentence
and
the
jeopardy
doesn't
run,
you
have
two
trials
in
that
situation.
it
may
be
a
close
parallel
but
i
really
haven't
considered
that
as
a
possibility
because
of
the
uniqueness
of
the
death
penalty
situation.
thank
you.
