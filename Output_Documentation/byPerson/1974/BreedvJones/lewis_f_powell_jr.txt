lewis

powell,

before
you
go
on,
do
i
understand
your
position
to
be
that
at
the
fitness
hearing
or
the
transfer
hearing
that
no
evidence
may
be
introduced
as
to
quilt
or
innocence?

the
minor
is
entitled
to
counsel
at
the
transfer
hearing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
suppose
counsel
insists
on
putting
an
evidence
of
the
minor's
innocence,
is
he
entitled
to
do
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
walker,
i
still
can't
quite
visualize
how
you
avoid
having
what
in
effect
is
a
full
adversary
trial
if
the
juvenile
and
his
counsel
wished
to
have
it.
i
think
you
agreed
yesterday,
he
would
be
entitled
to
counsel.
you're
representing
the
juvenile
at
a
fitness
hearing,
the
juvenile
persuades
you
that
he
didn't
commit
whatever
the
offense
may
be
with
which
he
is
charged.
if
you
do
your
duty
as
a
lawyer,
wouldn't
you
try
to
produce
witnesses
to
satisfy
the
juvenile
judge
if
you
thought
there
was
a
chance
of
transfer
that
he
had
not
committed
the
offense
and
wouldn't
the
state
then
put
on
his
witnesses
to
refute
your
testimony,
and
wouldn't
it
all
end
up
being
an
adversary
hearing?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
a
judge
took
that
position,
would
that
nullify
the
effectiveness
or
the
validity
of
the
transfer
hearing?
suppose
the
judge
just
said
“i'm
not
going
to
hear
any
evidence
that
pertains
to
whether
or
not
the
juvenile
committed
the
offense.”
well
i
think
that
some
--
i
don't
think
it
would
negate
it.
i
think
there's
still
the
question
of
the
juvenile's
particular
amenability
to
treatment
programs
available
through
the
juvenile
court.
i
think
that
in
most
instances,
the
judge
would
allow
in
some
evidence
pertaining
to
the
crime
such
as
he
may
want
to
consider
whether
the
crime
was
of
a
particularly
heinous
character,
or
whether
it's
a
very
serious
type
of
offense.
but
in
most
instances,
the
judge
will
say
“if
the
juvenile
is
charged
with
murder,
he's
charged
with
a
robbery
or
rape,”
that's
a
serious
crime
and
that's
enough
from
the
standpoint
of
the
california
statute.
i
point
out
in
california,
if
the
legislature
has
not
written
a
probable
cause
requirement
into
the
fitness
statute,
which
they
could've
done,
which
has
been
done
in
some
states.
