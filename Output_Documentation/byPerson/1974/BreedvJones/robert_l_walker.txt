mr.
robert
l.
walker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
initially
to
respond
just
briefly
to
a
couple
of
questions
that
you
asked
my
adversary.
first
of
all,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
in
an
answer
to
your
question
about
how
many
transfers
there
are
actually
are
in
california
of
the
latest
statistics
from
1972,
shall
ask
if
they're
available
indicate
that
there
are
approximately
--
there
are
exactly
509
transfers
out
of
50,000
delinquency
cases
so
only
1%
of
the
cases
result
in
transfer
to
adult
court.
secondly,
i
would
resist
the
characterization
of
the
fitness
hearing
in
california
as
a
duplicate
trial.
the
cases
in
the
statutes
are
quite
clear
in
pointing
out
that
a
fitness
hearing
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
minor's
guilt
or
innocence.
under
california
law,
you're
merely
attempting
to
determine
first
whether
the
minor
is
over
the
age
of
16.
secondly,
whether
the
minor
is
charged
with
a
criminal
law
violation,
and
thirdly,
whether
the
minor
would
be
amenable
to
the
treatment
programs
or
training
facilities
available
to
the
juvenile
court.
in
fact,
the
statute
says
that
a
minor
cannot
be
waived
on
the
basis
of
his
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
crime.
it's
not
a
sole
criterion
and
cannot
be
used
as
a
criterion
for
waiver.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
at
the
fitness
hearing,
there
is
evidence
about
--
is
admitted
sometimes
about
the
nature
of
the
offense.
commonly,
what
happens
is
that
the
police
reports
are
maybe
introduced
into
evidence
because
there
are
no
hearsay
is
admissible
to
fitness
hearing.
so
that
evidence
is
admissible
but
it's
admitted
solely
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
minor
is
amenable
to
the
juvenile
court
facilities.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
he
may
well
offer
evidence
of
mitigating
circumstances,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
no,
certainly
not.
the
nature
of
a
crime
is
relevant
but
relevant
only
to
the
statutory
criterion
of
amenability.
naturally,
if
they're
dealing
with
a
minor
who
is
charged
with
a
murder
or
a
rape,
that's
a
--
those
are
relevant
facts
for
the
court
would
take
into
consideration.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that's
an
incorrect
characterization
of
the
case
in
my
point
of
view
your
honor.
the
supreme
court
of
california
said
in
jimmy
h.
that
the
only
evidence
that
must
be
considered
by
the
court
at
the
fitness
hearing
is
a
probation
report
containing
the
minor's
previous
record.
there
were
a
number
of
other
factors
including
expert
testimony,
details
about
the
nature
of
offense,
but
those
the
court
said
are
relevant
only
to
question
of
amenability.
i
think
it's
quite
clear
in
the
decision.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
correct.
now,
this
minor
has
been
placed
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
no.
there
may
be
some
evidence
of
the
nature
of
the
crime
which
may
also
bear
upon
the
minor's
guilt
or
innocence.
that
evidence
will
be
taken
into
consideration
by
the
court
solely
in
connection
with
the
statutory
standard
of
amenability.
there
is
a
requirement
in
california
law
that
if
a
minor
is
transferred,
he
must
be
given
a
preliminary
hearing
within
10
days
so
the
minor
would
be
entitled
to
that
procedural
protection
under
california
statutory
law.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
yes,
he
is.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
i'm
not
sure
it
has
ever
come
up
in
a
case.
i
suppose
in
most
cases
the
court
would
hear
although
technically
perhaps
it
might
be
considered
almost
irrelevant.
this
minor
has
been
placed
in
jeopardy
in
two
quite
different
respects.
first
of
all,
he's
been
tried
twice,
the
very
same
offense
and
this
--
there's
no
dispute
about
and
our
basic
position
is
and
i
think
this
is
confirmed
by
numerous
opinions
of
this
court
that
a
double
jeopardy
clause
protects
a
defendant
and
let
us
not
forget
that
this
is
a
convicted
defendant,
a
minor
who's
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
although
the
double
jeopardy
clause
protects
the
defendant
against
possibility
of
two
prosecutions
for
the
same
offense.
quite
irrespective
of
the
penalties
that
might
be
opposed,
he
suffered
the
anxiety,
the
insecurity,
the
expense,
etcetera
of
two
trials
for
the
very
same
crime.
secondly,
he
was
exposed
to
a
considerably
more
severe
penalty
at
the
conclusion
of
his
felony
trial.
the
maximum
penalty
that
could
be
imposed
by
the
juvenile
court
in
this
case
was
to
commit
the
minor
to
the
california
youth
authority
until
age
21.
the
maximum
penalty
that
he
faced
in
his
adult
trial
on
the
other
hand
was
a
mandatory
sentence
of
from
five
years
to
life
imprisonment.
so
he
is
certainly
in
a
position
of
having
faced
a
very
severe
jeopardy
in
terms
of
the
penalty
that
could
be
imposed
by
the
adult
court.
now,
in
this
case,
the
adult
court
shows
to
commit
him
to
the
california
youth
authority
and
it's
quite
incorrect
to
believe
that
that
means
that
he
has
the
same
sentence
as
an
adult
that
he
would
have
had
as
a
juvenile.
as
a
juvenile,
he
could
only
be
held
by
the
youth
authority
until
age
21,
as
a
convicted
felon,
he
may
be
held
by
the
youth
authority
until
age
25.
at
present
time,
the
minor
is
on
parole,
from
the
youth
authority,
he
is
22
and
a
half
years
of
age.
if
indeed
he
had
been
sent
there
by
the
youth
authority,
he
would
already
be
free,
excuse
me,
by
the
juvenile
court,
he
would
be
free
of
the
juvenile
court's
jurisdiction.
there's
another
aspect
in
which
he's
been
exposed
not
only
to
a
more
severe
punishment
but
in
fact
a
double
punishment
and
that
is,
he
has
been
held
in
juvenile
hall
for
approximately
three
extra
weeks
as
a
result
of
his
totally
unnecessary
jurisdictional
hearing
in
juvenile
court.
under
california
law,
he
will
receive
no
credit
and
has
received
no
credit
towards
his
commitment
in
the
youth
authority.
so,
we
have
three
different
respects
in
which
this
minor
has
been
placed
in
jeopardy.
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
asked
the
question
of
my
colleague
over
here
before
about
whether
a
minor
could
be
transferred
after
an
acquittal.
i
think
that
that
question
is
open
under
california
law
but
i
would
point
out
that
there's
nothing
in
the
transfer
statute
that
precludes
that.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
no
california
case
that
is
directly
on
point.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
probably.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
richard
m.
was
a
case
where
the
minor
obtained
an
acquittal
in
juvenile
court
and
they
attempted
to
retry
him
in
juvenile
court.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that
was
double
jeopardy
under
both
the
federal
and
state
constitutions.
i
would
point
out
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
oh,
certainly.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
yes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
1972
the
california
supreme
court
in
a
case
called
donald
l.
,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
stated
that
the
preferred
practice
in
california
is
to
hold
a
fitness
hearing
before
the
adjudicatory
hearing.
so,
not
only
does
that
happen,
that
is
now
the
customary
practice
in
california.
it
is
not
required
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law,
but
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
pursuant
to
that
california
supreme
court
decision
that
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that
completely
avoids
the
double
jeopardy
problem.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
well,
that
doesn't
bear
on
the
question
of
whether
the
fitness
hearing
should
come
before
or
after
the
jurisdictional
hearing.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
no,
that's
a
separate
problem.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that's
correct.
there's
never
an
adjudication
and
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
i
think
they
should
always
have
the
fitness
hearing
first.
it
just
so
happens
that
in
this
case,
they
decided
to
hold
the
jurisdictional
hearing
first.
i
don't
think
there's
any
justification
for
that
procedure.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
--
all
of
the
authorities
in
the
juvenile
area
including
the
national
council
and
juvenile
court
judges,
the
national
council
in
crime
and
delinquency
and
all
of
the
model
statutes
and
acts
which
addressed
this
question
state
that
the
preferred
practice
from
the
standpoint
of
the
best
procedure
for
the
juvenile
and
for
the
juvenile
court
is
to
hold
the
fitness
hearing
first.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
yes.
what
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
in
that
instance
is
that
the
judge
must
disqualify
himself
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
--
and
that
is
not
a
serious
problem
in
california
nor
is
it
a
serious
problem
in
most
jurisdictions.
in
california,
the
juvenile
court
is
just
a
branch
of
the
superior
court,
so
it's
a
very
simple
matter
for
another
superior
court
judge
to
come
in
and
hear
the
matter.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that
is
correct.
there
are
some
smaller
counties
that
might
only
have
one
superior
court
judge.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
however,
in
california
we
have
a
procedure
where
a
superior
court
judge
can
be
affidavit
--
excuse
me,
can
be
disqualified
without
cause,
and
so
it's
very
common
for
judges
from
adjoining
counties
to
come
in
and
sit
on
those
cases.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
yes.
there's
no
question
that
it
would
be
a
burden.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
an
insuperable
burden
or
even
a
considerable
burden.
i
doubt
that
those
counties
account
for
very
many
transfer
hearings.
as
i
mentioned
yesterday,
only
1%
of
the
delinquency
cases
result
in
transfer
and
the
great
majority
of
those
cases
comes
from
the
urban
counties.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
wherever
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
yes,
but
my
statement
would
also
apply
to
both
cases
as
well.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
well
no.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
the
99%
of
the
cases
would
not
involve
transfer
hearings.
there's
a
very,
very
small
percentage
of
the
cases
in
california
in
which
there's
a
transfer
hearing
because
for
example
a
minor
must
be
over
the
age
of
16.
if
any
minor's
over
the
age
of
16,
there
cannot
be
a
transfer
hearing.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
under
16,
excuse
me.
and
in
addition,
in
most
cases
where
a
minor
is
not
charged
with
a
serious
offense
where
he
does
not
have
a
previous
record,
a
transfer
would
not
even
be
considered
as
a
possibility.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
unfortunately,
the
only
statistics
we
have
go
to
the
number
of
cases
that
are
actually
transferred.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that's
correct.
there
was
one
point
which
came
up
during
argument
yesterday
that
i
think
bear
us
some
clarification.
we
are
not
contending
of
course
that
the
jeopardy
attached
at
the
fitness
hearing.
we're
saying
the
jeopardy
attached
at
the
trial
in
the
juvenile
court,
which
is
called
the
jurisdictional
hearing,
and
at
the
trial
in
the
adult
court.
and
of
course
this
court
has
held
in
collins
against
loisel
that
jeopardy
does
not
attach
at
a
preliminary
hearing
because
that
hearing
does
not
involve
an
adjudication
of
guilt.
similarly,
jeopardy
would
not
attach
at
a
fitness
hearing,
nor
would
jeopardy
attach
for
example
at
a
penalty
hearing
in
a
death
penalty
case
because
that
hearing
would
be
in
the
nature
of
a
sentencing
or
disposition
hearing,
rather
than
an
adjudicatory
hearing.
this
does
not
mean
that
evidence
relating
to
the
offense
would
be
inadmissible
to
fitness
hearing.
it
simply
means
that
that
evidence
would
be
only
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
the
minor
should
be
retained
in
the
juvenile
system,
or
transferred
to
the
adult
system.
now,
petitioner
relies
quite
heavily
upon
this
so
called
theory
of
continuing
jeopardy.
and
as
i
understand
that
theory,
it
insists
that
the
initial
proceeding
must
culminate
in
a
final
disposition
of
the
case
before
a
second
jeopardy
could
attach
in
the
second
prosecution.
now,
just
yesterday
in
opinion
issued
by
this
court,
united
states
against
jenkins,
this
court
in
a
unanimous
opinion
rejected
the
broad
type
of
continuing
jeopardy
theory
which
has
been
espoused
by
petitioner
and
stated
that
that
theory
which
was
originated
in
a
dissenting
opinion
by
justice
holmes
in
the
kepner
case,
has
never
been
adopted
by
a
majority
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that
is
correct.
that
was
an
appeal
from
an
acquittal.
but
i
think
that
the
reasoning
of
kepner
and
of
a
number
of
the
other
cases
involving
the
continuing
jeopardy
principle
demonstrate
that
that
principle
is
limited
to
a
situation
where
the
prosecution
--
excuse
me,
where
the
defendant
has
appealed.
and
where
there
has
been
a
reversal
on
appeal
and
where
there
is
a
re-prosecution
after
that
reversal.
that
is
not
the
same
situation
as
we
have
in
this
case.
garry
jones
did
not
ask
to
be
retried
in
adult
court.
it's
certainly
arguably
fair
in
the
case
of
--
a
case
where
the
defendant
actually
asks
for
his
prosecution
to
be
reversed
for
the
people
to
vindicate
their
rights
by
retrying
him
if
indeed
he
does
obtain
the
reversal
which
he
sought.
but
here,
we
have
an
entirely
different
situation,
the
case
where
the
reversal
was
not
initiated
or
sought
by
the
defendant.
now
as
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
yes,
that's
true.
they
have
accepted
the
continuing
jeopardy
theory
in
this
context.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
continuing
jeopardy
theory,
at
least
this
broad
type
of
continuing
jeopardy
theory
espoused
by
petitioner,
is
inconsistent
with
a
number
of
decisions
by
this
court
in
a
whole
line
of
cases
where
this
court
has
held
that
where
an
initial
prosecution
is
aborted
for
example
by
a
mistrial
brought
about
by
the
prosecutor,
or
improperly
by
the
court
that
they
are
--
even
though
there
has
not
been
a
final
culmination
of
the
initial
proceeding,
nevertheless
jeopardy
attaches
for
the
purpose
of
barring
a
second
prosecution.
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case,
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
undermining
a
number
of
decisions
and
very
basic
policies
that
are
fundamental
to
double
jeopardy
protection.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
well,
i'm
not
certain
that
you
have
to
take
that
into
account
for
the
reason
that
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
yes.
the
difference
between
this
case
and
winship
call
to
mckeiver
is
that
in
this
case,
the
minor
has
been
convicted
in
adult
court
of
a
felony
and
suffers
from
all
the
disabilities
of
a
felony
conviction
than
any
other
person
in
california
would
suffer
whether
he's
a
juvenile
or
an
adult
which
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
well,
what
i'm
suggesting
mr.
justice
brennan
is
that
if
you
adapted
a
continuing
jeopardy
theory
in
this
case,
on
the
theory
that
this
is
a
juvenile
case
that
i
think
you
would
of
necessity,
it
would
also
be
applied
in
the
adult
court
context,
because
this
minor
suffers
all
of
the
same
disabilities
for
any
adult
would
suffer
who
has
been
convicted
of
a
felony.
under
california
law,
garry
jones
for
example,
cannot
have
his
record
sealed
to
where
as
if
you
were
adjudicated
delinquent,
he
would
have
a
right
to
have
that
adjudication
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
i
agree
that
the
california
supreme
court
made
that
statement.
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
white,
that
that
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
yes.
but
it's
the
same
california
supreme
court,
which
interestingly
enough,
held
that
donald
l.
that
the
procedure
that
we're
advocating
is
preferred
procedure.
i
would
suggest
for
that
statement
in
brian
was
colored
by
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
right.
i
think
that
the
california
statement
in
brian
really
was
founded
upon
the
peculiar
factual
situation
where
a
minor
had
actually
consent
of
the
california
youth
authority,
and
was
transferred
back
to
juvenile
court
because
they
decided
he
--
they
didn't
have
enough
time
to
rehabilitate
him
and
he
was
incorrigible.
and
then
they
decided
even
though
he
had
already
begun
his
treatment
program
as
a
juvenile
to
transfer
him
for
another
prosecution.
now,
i
would
suggest
for
that
that's
perhaps
an
even
more
flagrant
violation
of
a
double
jeopardy
guaranteed
than
we
have
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
yes,
i
agree.
i
obviously
don't
agree
with
the
brian
decision.
but
turning
to
some
of
these
policy
reasons
concerning
the
juvenile
court,
which
you
brought
up
mr.
justice
brennan,
it's
our
position
that
if
you
apply
the
double
jeopardy
protection
in
this
context,
you
will
actually
be
enhancing
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
juvenile
court
system.
whereas
in
mckeiver,
this
court
felt
that
that
system
would
be
threatened.
for
one
thing,
this
court
has
frequently
emphasized
the
absolute
necessity
of
a
juvenile
court
system
operating
in
an
informal
manner.
and
by
an
informal
manner,
i
think
that
what
was
meant
was
that
in
most
juvenile
cases,
the
juvenile
if
he's
indeed
guilty
will
come
in
and
admit
his
transgression.
there
will
not
be
even
the
necessity
of
a
formal
adversary
hearing
with
counsel
and
all
the
other
trappings.
and
then
the
court
will
get
on
with
its
primary
business,
which
it
is
to
rehabilitate
the
juvenile.
now,
that
policy
goal
of
informality
is
really
largely
frustrated.
if
the
juvenile
contests
the
petition
and
decides
to
stand
trial,
in
that
case,
he
will
be
represented
by
counsel.
it
will
be
a
formal
adversary
hearing.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
if
you
hold
the
jurisdictional
hearing
first,
the
minor
does
not,
at
that
point,
know
whether
he's
going
to
be
retained
in
the
juvenile
system
or
ultimately
transferred
to
the
adult
court
system.
so
he
will,
as
a
consequence,
be
extremely
reluctant
to
admit
his
guilt.
as
a
result
of
that
admission,
he
may
later
find
himself
in
state
prison.
indeed
the
volume
on
juvenile
court
practice,
which
has
been
published
by
the
california
state
bar
to
advice
juvenile
court
practitioners
on
how
to
handle
these
kinds
of
cases,
advises
counsel
not
to
encourage
the
minor
to
talk
freely
with
the
probation
officer
until
he
knows
whether
the
juvenile
will
be
retained
in
the
juvenile
system
or
transferred.
so
that
policy
goal
will
be
totally
frustrated
if
you
don't
hold
the
fitness
hearing
first.
secondly,
the
juvenile
will
be
kept
in
a
continuing
state
of
anxiety,
insecurity,
unless
you
hold
certification
hearing
or
a
transfer
hearing
initially.
we
believe
that
from
the
rehabilitative
point
of
view
it's
extremely
vital
that
the
juvenile
know
whether
he's
going
to
be
treated
as
a
juvenile
or
as
an
adult.
certainly,
this
court
has
found
that
the
appearance
as
well
as
the
actuality
of
fairness
is
crucial
in
terms
of
the
rehabilitation
of
a
juvenile.
and
from
a
standpoint
of
a
minor,
he
can't
very
well
feel
that
he
is
being
dealt
with
fairly
if
he
is
being
exposed
to
a
double
prosecution,
which
he
knows
has
been
held
to
be
repugnant
in
the
case
of
even
the
most
hardened
criminals.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that's
a
possibility.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
well
if
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that
may
be
true.
but
i
would
hasten
to
point
out
that
after
that
fitness
hearing
is
conducted,
and
if
the
judge
determines
to
retain
the
minor
in
the
juvenile
system,
then
the
minor
will
rather
freely
in
most
instances,
discuss
his
case
with
the
juvenile
probation
officer
or
with
the
judge.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
right
and
the
fitness
--
the
decision
on
fitness
would
be
made
at
a
very
early
point
in
the
proceeding.
as
i
pointed
out,
it
is
not
a
full
trial
and
normally
it
could
be
made
rather
soon
after
the
juvenile
is
taken
into
custody
by
the
probation
department.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
i
--
no,
mr.
justice
powell,
i
do
not
believe
so.
i
have
seen
a
number
of
transcripts
from
california
where
indeed
the
juvenile's
counsel
has
put
on
some
evidence.
but
that
evidence
normally
will
be
character
witnesses
or
evidence
about
the
juvenile's
rehabilitation.
occasionally,
in
a
rare
case,
counsel
may
even
produce
someone
from
california
youth
authority
to
testify
that
this
juvenile
can
be
dealt
with
as
a
juvenile,
is
extremely
rare
and
unusual.
in
fact,
i've
never
seen
the
case
in
california
where
a
juvenile
would
put
on
a
defense
at
the
fitness
hearing.
for
one
thing,
he
realizes
that
he
will
have
an
opportunity
to
put
on
that
defense
later.
and
he
doesn't
want
to
tip
his
hand,
so
to
speak,
to
reveal
his
entire
defense
to
the
prosecution
at
that
early
stage.
i've
even
seen
case
where
the
court
has
refused
to
hear
evidence
going
to
a
jurisdictional
fact
stating
that
that
was
irrelevant
under
california
law.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
the
evidence
that
normally
is
introduced
is
police
report.
occasionally,
there
might
be
some
other
evidence.
the
police
report
is
admissible
to
fitness
hearing
in
california
because
hearsay
is
allowed
to
come
in.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that
establishes
so
and
so,
you
know,
says
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that's
correct.
and
normally,
in
california
that's
considered
to
be
sufficient.
this
may
seem
to
be
a
peculiar
procedure,
but
it
is
a
procedure
which
is
adapted
in
the
great
majority
of
jurisdictions,
which
only
three
jurisdictions
in
the
entire
united
states
require
a
showing
of
delinquency
prior
to
a
transfer.
and
there
are
some
other
jurisdictions
which
require
a
showing
of
probable
cause.
but
the
great
majority
of
jurisdictions
require
neither
at
the
fitness
hearing.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
well,
there
are
three
jurisdictions
which
require
the
delinquency
hearing
be
held
first;
massachusetts,
west
virginia
and
alabama.
there
are
19
jurisdictions
that
require
the
fitness
hearing
to
be
held
first.
and
it's
a
little
bit
questionable
about
what
is
required
in
the
other
jurisdictions.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
permit
it
either
way.
however,
it
would
seem
first
of
all
from
the
absence
of
cases
challenging
procedure
on
double
jeopardy
grounds.
and
also
from
the
fact
of
the
legislatures
have
not
even
required
in
some
jurisdictions,
a
probable
cause
requirement,
or
another
jurisdictions,
the
delinquency
finding.
but
the
usual
practice
in
those
jurisdictions
is
to
hold
the
fitness
hearing
first.
and
that's
recommended,
as
i've
said,
by
all
of
legal
commentators
except
one,
and
by
all
of
the
model
codes.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that
is
the
one
commentator
that
i
was
referring
to,
yes,
professor
karr.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
well,
our
position
is,
the
jeopardy
attaches
at
the
jurisdictional
hearing
in
juvenile
court
when
the
first
witness
is
sworn
and
begins
to
testify.
and
that
likewise
--
mr.
robert
l.
walker
right,
the
adjudicatory
hearing.
and
that
jeopardy
then
attaches
in
the
criminal
proceeding
also
when
the
first
witness
has
sworn
and
begins
to
testify.
mr.
robert
l.
walker
that's
right.
and
the
experts
tell
us
that
there's
absolutely
no
reason
why
that
decision
can't
be
reached
before
the
adjudicatory
hearing.
and
as
i've
pointed
out,
this
is
the
practice
in
19
of
the
22
jurisdictions
which
require
of
a
hearing
to
be
held
at
either
one
point
or
another.
