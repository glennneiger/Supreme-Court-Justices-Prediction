justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
supreme
court
of
california
opinion
concluding
that
this
procedure
is
not
a
violation
of
the
california
constitutional
provision
against
double
jeopardy?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
california
--
in
california
if
you
try
a
juvenile
in
an
adjudicatory
hearing
and
he
is
acquitted
or
whatever
you
call
that,
what
do
you
call
that,
dismiss
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
could
you
bring
him
back
and
try
him
again
for
the
same
thing
in
the
juvenile
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
constitutional
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
state
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
federal?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
s
a
duo?
hold
it.
so
there
is
jeopardy
at
--
under
the
california
law
jeopardy
attaches?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you're
argument
here
isn't
--
that
it
doesn't
attach?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
never
been
--
it's
never
been
over?
i
mean
there's
never
been
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
california
--
now,
bryan
was
after
richard
m.?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
bryan,
bryan
approves
this
procedure
but
doesn't
approve
the
retrial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there's
a
different
consequence
of
conviction
other
than
punishment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
has
different
consequence.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
may
affect
lots
of
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
he
can't
be
tried
twice?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
both
agree
that
that
the
adjudication
is
a
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
suggestion
is
that
unless
there's
double
punishment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
exposure
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
just
the
fact
that
he's
tried
twice
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
not
enough
so
that
on
your
theory,
i
take
it
that
the
state
should
always
be
able
to
appeal
as
long
as
it
agreed
not
to
punish
him
any
more
than
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
the
first
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume,
he
went
through
the
juvenile
procedure
and
the
entire
juvenile
procedure
was
exhausted,
when
he
became
what,
21
in
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
21.
well,
at
that
time
you
decide
that
we
just
have
failed
with
this
young
man
so
we're
going
to
now
try
him
as
an
adult.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
not
sure
there's
difference
though
in
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
it's
gone
through
the
dispositional
hearing
that
that
should
terminate
the
initial
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
once
you've
gone
through
the
dispositional
stage
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
you
--
after
adjudication
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
if
they
keep
jurisdiction
and
then
adjudicate
them,
and
then
they
use
authority
rejects
it,
turns
them
back.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly
but
having
it
before
doesn't
cure
that
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
the
california
supreme
court
has
adopted
the
continuing
jeopardy
theory,
at
least
for
the
purposes
of
the
california
constitution.
and
also
in
brian
ruled
on
it
for
purposes
of
the
federal
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
california
court
thought
that
holding
in
brian,
thought
that
saying
that
there
was
jeopardy
and
this
sort
of
a
situation
would
undermine
the
juvenile
system
in
the
sense
that
judges
would
be
less
more
likely
to
transfer
to
adult
courts,
and
to
direct
out
of
the
juvenile
system
more
a
larger
percentage
of
juvenile
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
know
more
about
how
your
system
works
than
we
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
that's
consistent
and
i
think
that's
consistent
enough,
just
because
this
would
be
the
preferred
procedure
and
you
have
to
hold
the
transfer
hearing
first,
wouldn't
avoid
the
double
jeopardy
problem
that
arose
in
brian.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
you
would,
yes.
and
i
would
also
think
that
however
if
you
upheld
that,
this
one
would
be
a
fortiori.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
so
i
have
it
straightened
up.
when
do
you
say
that
the
jeopardy
attaches
here,
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
or
at
the
end
of
it,
or
when
he
was
adjudicated?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
at
the
adjudicatory
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
it
wouldn't
--
so
the
judge,
if
he
even
starts
the
adjudicatory
hearing,
according
to
you,
must
either
keep
him
in
juvenile
court
or
dismiss
him?
