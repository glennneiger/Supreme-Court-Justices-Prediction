brennan,

what
kind
of
hearing
is
the
transfer
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
an
adversary
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
examination
clause,
examination
witnesses?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
findings
in
support
of
the
order
of
transfer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
findings
in
these
transfer
proceedings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
if
there
were
dispute
of
fact
as
to
one
of
these
important
notes,
there
would
be
a
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
goes
to
inquiries
in
one
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
ever
a
combination
of
those
inquiries
in
one
proceeding?
that
is
a
determination
of
the
offense
and
a
determination
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
that
disposition
hearing
--
the
disposition
to
turn
him
over
to
the
youth
authority
to
decide
and
then
in
effect
as
if
it
were
a
sentence
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
namely?
custody
will
be
different?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
looking
backward.
that's
looking
backwards.
they
could
have
put
him
somewhere
else.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
we've
got
a
conviction
as
he
would
not
have
had
as
the
case
ended
in
the
dual
process
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
that's
--
at
that's
the
point
to
transfer
him
under
your
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
walker,
i'm
not
certain
whether
under
the
california
system,
there
might
be
a
transfer
proceeding
without
first
having
an
adjudicatory
proceeding,
may
there
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
happen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
when
that
practice
is
followed,
does
that
avoid
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
if
you
have
the
fitness
hearing
and
it's
decided
at
the
fitness
hearing
to
transfer,
then
there's
never
any
adjudication?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
we
don't
have
this
double
jeopardy
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then
why,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
to,
why
should
we
ever
have
a
double
jeopardy
problem?
why
don't
they
always
have
the
fitness
hearing
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
that
the
fitness
hearing,
if
he's
had
a
prior
record,
the
judge
who
presides
at
the
fitness
hearing
learns
of
the
prior
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
suppose,
he
decides
not
to
transfer
him
and
then
proceeds
to
the
jurisdictional
hearing
knowing
of
the
fellow's
past
record,
are
any
problems
raised
by
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
transfer
to
another
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
walker
though
all
those
cases
of
course
are
adult
cases.
i
take
it
our
approach
to
the
application
of
juvenile
system
of
some
of
the
guarantees
that
otherwise
are
applied
to
the
--
in
cases
in
adult
prosecutions.
we
have
to
take
into
account,
don't
we,
the
special
values
of
the
juvenile
system
and
the
extent
of
which
applying
those
double
jeopardy
principles
to
the
juvenile
system
may
impair
its
effectiveness?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we
certainly
did
as
to
the
jury
trial
in
mckeiver.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
winship
suggested
that,
didn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
thinking
particularly
the
determination
whether
or
not
we
should
or
shouldn't,
for
this
purpose,
adapt
the
continuing
jeopardy
theory.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what's
the
practice
mr.
walker?
surely,
there
must
be
some
evidence
before
this
determination
that
he's
to
be
transferred
that
he
did
commit
some
crime,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
does
that
establish?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nothing
more
than
just
a
charge,
isn't
it?
