these
four

were

with

but
in
this

were
there
findings?
justice

now,
this
case
after
he's
transferred
to
the
regular
adult
court,
he
could
have
been
acquitted,
couldn't
he?
justice

stewart
i
thought
the
--
we
were
told
that
the
case
of
jimmy
h.
in
the
california
court
said
that
there
were
three
criteria
that
the
court
should
consider
in
dealing
with
this
ultimate
statutory
standard
of
amenability
and
one
was
the
serious
of

seriousness
of
the
offense,
two,
was
the
previous
record
and
three
was
just
basic
amenability
to
juvenile
corrective
procedures.
did
i
mistook
--
did
i
misunderstand?
justice

stewart
the
ultimate
statutory
standard
is
amenability?
justice

stewart
surely
there
must
be
counties
up
on
the

those
northern
counties
near
state
though
that
don't
have
so
many
superior

judges
in
the

right.
justice

we're
talking
about
cases
in
which
there's
not
a
transfer.
we're
talking
about
the
99%
of
the
cases
where
there's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
jurisdictional
hearing
and
not
a
transfer.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
a
transfer
hearing
and
not
a
transfer
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
its
99%,
not
1%.
justice
potter
stewart
if
he's
under
16.
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
jurisdictions
in
addition
to
california
provide
for
a
transfer
hearing
after
a
filing
of
delinquency?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
others
seem
to
be
like
california.
they
permit
it
either
--
permit
it
either
to
come
in
either
order?
