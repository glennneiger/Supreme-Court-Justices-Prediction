chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
drope
against
missouri,
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
walsh,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
acknowledge
i
suppose
that
a
person
could
be
mentally
ill,
seriously
insane,
whatever
that
term
means,
can
still
be
competent
to
stand
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
am
just
talking
about
the
distinction
between
the
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
that
was
not
so,
you
would
some
problem
about
every
verdict
that
was
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
because
the
--
if
you
reason
that
way
then
the
critic
would
demonstrate
that
the
person
shouldn't
have
been
tried
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
long
was
he
in
the
hospital
after
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
is
again
counsel,
let's
try
to
keep
these
thing
separated,
a
person
could
be
very
much
in
need
of
psychiatric
help
and
still
be
competent
to
stand
trial,
don't
you
concede
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
countless
cases,
hundreds
of
them,
where
psychiatrists
have
reported
in
pre-trial,
that
the
defendant
is
mentally
sick,
he
is
in
need
of
psychiatric
care,
but
he
is
competent
to
stand
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
only
going
to
the
standard
now.
are
you
suggesting
that
client
or
the
wife's
view
of
the
matter
only
as
a
point
that
should
have
altered
the
court
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
order
the
examination.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
improvements.
[attempt
to
laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
cases,
those
early
cases
were
in
a
day
when
no
capital
defendant
was
ever
on
bail
too,
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
weren't
they
until
recently?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
feasible
to
continue,
just
suspend
this
trial,
or
hold
the
jury
somewhere
for
21
days
at
least
while
he
was
in
hospital
and
probably
a
longer
period
than
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
asked
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
walsh.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
find
that
on
page
11
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
was
the
this
reading
of
psychiatrist
report
that
it
is
not
a
typical
report
on
examination
directly
to
determine
the
competency
to
stand
trial
it
seems
to
be
--
seems
almost
to
avoid
that
issue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
is
the
request?
where
is
the
direction
from
the
court?
do
you
have
any
specific
directions
as
to
the
scope
and
purpose
of
the
examination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
have
no
specific
directions
so
far
as
this
record
shows
from
the
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
defense
counsel,
i
don't
recall
whether
i
saw
any
thing
in
the
record
of
about
his
views
on
the
matter?
now,
is
there
something
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
ducted
a
lum
testify
at
the
post
trial
hearing
or
did
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
150
i
think
it
is.
i
just
trying
to
identify
in
what
context
that
testimony
occurred?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
history
repeats
three
or
four
times
a
man
who
is
conducted
himself
the
way,
this
defendant
or
this
petitioner
had
conducted
himself
is
in
serious
psychiatric
condition
and
needs
psychiatric
help,
but
does
he
any
where
in
that
testimony
express
an
opinion
that
his
competence
to
stand
trial.
i
couldn't
put
my
finger
on
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
neither
of
those
goes
to
directly
to
the
competence
to
stand
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
not
something
in
this
record,
statement
that
you
may
find
him
at
the
hospital
and
he
preferred
to
be
dead
than
to
be
tried
for
this
offense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
have
been
feasible
--
does
--
can
we
tell
from
this
record
about
his
medical
condition?
would
it
have
been
feasible
to
conduct
this
competency
examination
a
day
or
two
or
three
after
he
had
shot
himself?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
psychiatrist
testimony,
was
there
not,
at
the
motion
for
a
new
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
doctor
lum,
i
thought
your
â€“
made
that
dr.
lum
testified
that
the
motion
for
a
new
trail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
none
of
them
testified
at
the
motion
for
a
new
trial,
no
testimony
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
the
traditional
way,
even
after
the
judge
had
spoken
would
be
to
make
an
offer
of
prove
to
say
that,
if
the
court
will
permit,
i
will
call
two
psychiatrists
whose
testimony
will
be
substantially
as
follows,
that's
the
traditional
way
of
deserving
the
point
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
then
at
the
close
of
the
trial,
when
the
motion
was
made
for
a
new
trial,
did
i
understand
you
and
responding
to
mr.
justice
white,
to
say
that
there
was
no
proffer
of
any
testimony
on
the
subject
of
his
competency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
walsh,
you
have
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
often,
the
prosecutor
initiates
such
a
motion
just
as
a
protected
measure,
does
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
[inaudible]
motion
for
a
mistrial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
defense
counsel's
view
of
the
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
confuses
me
a
little,
i
don't
know
those
numbers
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
am
putting
back
at
the
earlier
stage,
at
the
motions
for
new
trial,
did
defense
counsel
file
an
affidavit
or
give
a
testimony
on
the
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
would
certainly
have
been
one
of
the
most
competent
witnesses
on
the
subject,
would
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
defense
counsel
had
found
difficulty
in
communicating
with
them
in
the
first
three
days
of
trial
or
in
weeks
preceding
the
trial,
preparing
for
trial,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
he
would
have
filed
an
affidavit
or
taking
the
stand
and
testify
to
that
effect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
explanation
would
be
the
one
that
you
have
abandoned
that
he
was
ineffective
but
another
equally
rational
explanation
would
be
that
he
could
not
give
any
such
testimony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
walsh
appeared
in
this
case
in
the
courts
previously
as
a
volunteer
and
you
have
come
here
in
that
capacity.
we
thank
you
for
your
assistance
to
the
court
and
of
course
your
assistance
to
your
client.
we
thank
you
mr.
walsh.
