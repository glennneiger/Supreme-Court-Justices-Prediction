justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
was
the
date
of
that
examination
in
relation
to
the
trial
of
mr.
drope?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
they
--
how
long
--
had
the
trial
had
been
going
out
a
bit
at
this
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
was
when,
he
apprehended
that
he
might
have
to
appear,
that
day
was
it
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
their
examination
was
how
long
after
the
actual
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
emphasis
is
only
on
whether
the
said
circumstances
were
such
as
to
require
that
hearing
and
the
examination
by
a
psychiatrist
to
determine
his
competency
to
stand
trial?
absolutely.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
suggest
that
every
time
some
one
needs
a
psychiatrist
that
means
automatically
there
has
to
be
such
a
determination
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that,
no
matter
what
the
circumstance
is,
if
it's
capital
case,
one
leaves
the
courtroom
disputes
that
the
court
trial
can't
go
on?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
of
course,
and
even
alexander
there
were
circumstances
under
which
there
was
presence
of
sorts
might
have
been
in
his
cell
closer
to
television
set?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
you
go
as
far
as
to
suggest
that
our
cases
really
hold
that
if
it's
capital
trial,
the
defendant
absents
himself,
even
though
he
just
leaves
the
courtroom
in
disputes,
the
trail
aborts
until
they
bring
him
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
addition
i
take
it,
if
i
understood
you
earlier,
you
submit
that
there
had
to
be
a
determination
of
whether
he
was
capable
of
knowing
an
intelligent
waiver?
