justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
the
you
might
not
be
here
either,
if
the
court
had
refused
to
continuance,
gone
on
with
the
trial,
but
then
immediately
at
the
termination
of
the
trial
to
just
as
soon
as
it
was
feasible
had
a
the
kind
of
hearing
with
the
scope,
that
covered
that
factors
that
you
wanted,
and
then
it
was
found
that
he
was
competent
to
stand
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
fact
is
that
the
hearing
is
held
after
trial
didn't
go
into
that
phase
of
the
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
the
necessity
for
a
hearing
as
to
competence
to
stand
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
that?
did
that
come
out
â€“
was
that
part
of
the
proceedings
in
open
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
the
proceedings
of
the
motion
for
new
trial
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
is
that
contained
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
that's
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
think
--
the
motion
for
a
new
trial
to
prove
that
absence
of
the
trial
whether
voluntary
or
involuntary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
i
take
it
if
the
trial
judge
said
the
burden
was
on
the
defendant
to
prove
involuntariness?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
did
state
that
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
--
do
you
recall
whether
at
the
motion
for
new
trial,
the
defendant
offered
any
evidence
with
respect
to
his
mental
history?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
he
referred
to
a
psychiatrist
or
any
doctors
or
anything
to
go
into
the
question
of
whether
he
was
competent
to
have
involuntary
--
to
make
a
voluntary
choice?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
several
years
later
after
affirmance
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
was
an
opportunity
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defender
if
he
wanted
to
put
on
that
kind
of
a
case
that
at
that
time
he
could
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
defendant
either
during
the
trial
or
during
the
motion
--
motion
for
new
trial
ever
said
that
the
fact
that
he
shot
himself
plus
all
the
other
evidence
with
respect
to
his
mental
condition
indicates
that
he
wasn't
competent?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
during
--
either
during
the
trial
or
the
motion
for
new
trial
was
there
did
the
defendant
attempt
to
say
that
his
shooting
himself
changes
the
whole
picture
with
respect
to
his
competency?
justice
byron
r.
white
his
attorney
was
there
and
he
made
no
such
contentions.
justice
byron
r.
white
put
him
on
the
stand
himself
at
the
motion
for
new
trial,
presented
him
as
a
witness
and
you
say
there
wasn't
any
evidence
of
cooperation
but
apparently
there
was
at
the
motion
for
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
see
any
ability
to
communicate
in
that
--
on
the
face
of
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
at
the
motion
for
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
was
that
after?
