mr.
neil
macfarlane
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
petitioner's
counsel
mr.
walsh
has
set
forth
the
issues
very
adequately
and
also
most
of
the
fact
situation.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
first,
to
point
number
one,
and
that
of
course
is
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
erred
in
not
granting
the
petitioner
a
psychiatric
hearing
or
examination
prior
to
trial
to
determine
his
competency.
pate
of
course,
requires
such
a
hearing
or
examination
for
every
bona
fide
doubt
of
that
person's
competency
exists.
i
think
it's
necessary
to
determine
or
to
define
what
bona
fide
doubt
of
a
person's
competency
to
proceed
is.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
i
believe
that's
right
your
honor.
but
the
lower
federal
courts
have
go
on
to
define
as
substantial
facts
of
one's
--
challenging
one's
competency
or
also
reasonable
cause
to
believe
one
might
not
be
competent.
reasonable
cause
is
simply
the
language
used
by
missouri
statutes.
i
think
the
real
key
here
and
what
i
want
to
emphasize
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
missouri,
is
the
phrase
competency
to
proceed.
it
is
not
a
mental
disease
or
defect.
it
is
whether
or
not
that
person
can
consult
with
counsel,
assist
in
his
defense,
and
whether
he
has
a
rational,
knows
facts
and
understanding
of
the
proceedings.
having
set
that
as
--
set
the
tone
for
the
argument
and
saying
that
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
applying
the
facts
in
this
case
to
the
pate
test,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
facts
relied
on
by
the
petitioner.
first,
in
his
brief
he
contends
that
very
nature
of
the
crime
should
point
to
incompetency
to
proceed
and
as
he
stated,
the
crime
involved
a
rape.
at
the
time
of
the
crime
the
petitioner
was
intoxicated,
or
at
least
had
been
drinking
for
several
hours.
so,
you
have
an
intoxication,
you
have
a
sexual
perversion
involved
in
the
crime.
these
elements
or
these
mental
diseases
are
specifically
exempted
on
a
missouri
statute,
as
being
cause
to
believe
a
man
is
not
competent
to
proceed.
logically,
i
see
no
reason
why
a
man's
sexual
perversion
or
intoxication
means
that
he
could
not
consult
his
counsel
in
a
rational
manner.
two
other
factors
are
that
the
petitioner's
counsel,
trial
counsel,
secured
a
psychiatric
examination
form,
and
also
the
report
handed
down
by
the
psychiatrist.
i
would
like
to
quote
from
that
report.
on
pages
8-12
or
13
of
the
appendix,
on
page
11
the
psychiatric
states,
“there
was
no
sign
as
to
the
presence
of
any
delusions,
illusions,
hallucinations,
obsessions,
ideas
of
reference,
compulsions
or
phobias.”
he
goes
on
to
state
that
mr.
drope
was
well
oriented
in
all
spheres.
he
knew
what
time
it
was
obviously,
he
knew
where
he
was,
he
knew
what
he
was
doing.
he
got
the
goes
–
the
psychiatrist
went
on
to
state
that
mr.
drope
was
able
without
trouble
to
answer
questions
testing
judgment.
he
also
said
that
he
didn't
even
find
any
strong
signs
of
psychosis.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
the
psychosis
statement
your
honor
is
on
page
12,
approximately
three-fourth
of
the
way
down
the
page.
slightly
before
the
last
statement,
in
the
middle
of
the
page
he
--
the
psychiatrist
states
at
that
apparently
abnormal
sexual
acts
are
part
of
mr.
drope's
own
culture
and
he
concludes
that
mr.
drope
as
an
neurotic
individual.
he
is
a
sociopath.
he
has
sexual
perversions
and
that
he
should
be
under
the
care
of
a
psychiatric.
what
i
do
want
to
emphasize
the
statements
by
the
psychiatrics
that
he
was
able
without
trouble
to
answer
questions,
testing
judgment
that
he
was
oriented
in
all
spheres
and
that
he
was
not
under
any
delusions.
these
factors
i
believe
go
to
the
competency
of
mr.
drope
to
proceed
with
trial.
they
go
with
the
competency
of
him
to
consult
with
counsel
to
reason,
to
assist
his
own
defense.
i
think
on
the
whole
the
psychiatric
report
in
effect
substantiates
the
fact
that
mr.
drope
was
competent
rather
then
suggest
that
he
was
incompetent.
another
fact
relied
on
by
the
petitioner
who
had
his
counsel
move
for
continuance
and
asked
for
the
psychiatric
examination.
the
motion
for
the
continuance
is
find
on
page-seven
of
the
appendix
and
the
close
reading
of
that
emotion
indicates
that
he
is
simply
asking
for
psychiatric
evaluation
based
on
the
psychiatrist
report
wherein
the
psychiatrist
said
he
should
be
under
his
psychiatric
care.
petitioner's
counsel
did
not
state
that
he
felt
that
the
petitioner
should
have
psychiatric
help.
he
did
not
state
anywhere
in
the
record
that
he
ever
felt
petitioner
could
not
communicate
with
him,
that
he
could
not
assist
him
or
that
he
was
not
assisting
or
consulting
or
helping
him
in
his
defense.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
right,
mr.
chief
justice
it
does
not
address
itself
to
that
problem.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no
sir.
this
examination,
your
honor,
was
undertaken
merely
by
petitioner's
counsel.
i
don't
think
the
court
was
ever
aware
that
the
examination
was
being
held.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no
your
honor,
he
did
not
and
it's
quite
obvious
from
the
report
that
he
did
not
proceed
under
the
missouri
statute
which
sets
out
certain
requirements
and
certain
findings
there
must
be
made
in
a
psychiatric
report.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
the
motion
for
continuance
has
really
all
the
earmarks
of
a
dilatory
motion
rather
than
one
where
that
counsel
was
truly
concern
with
his
client's
competency
to
proceed.
the
trial
was
initially
set
on
april,
late
on
april
and
continued
until
may
26.
this
motion
was
filed
on
may
27.
the
record
was
not
indicate
that
why
there
was
a
one
day
difference.
but
the
report
at
any
rate
came
three
months
after
the
psychiatrist
had
handed
his
report
to
petitioner's
counsel.
and
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
court
and
counsel
wherein
the
court
informed
counsel
that
the
assignment
division,
another
division
of
the
circuit
court
wherein
pretrial
motions
are
held,
had
advised
petitioner's
counsel
that
if
he
was
truly
serious
about
the
motion,
he
should
file
it
in
proper
form.
now,
petitioner's
counsel
on
his
appeal,
on
his
certiorari
has
challenged
that
statement
by
saying
what
is
proper
form?
the
state
contends
that
proper
form
with
the
form
would
be
a
motion
stating
that
the
man
could
not
communicate
and
consult
and
that
he
did
not
follow
the
dusky
test.
in
another
words,
he
could
not
get
assist
in
his
own
defense.
another
fact
that
lined
up
by
the
petitioner
is
that
the
state
of
missouri,
acquiesced
in
the
motion
for
continuance
in
the
course
for
psychiatric
examination.
this
is
simply
office
policy.
there
is
no
decision
whether
or
not
to
do
it.
it
is
simply
done
in
all
cases
by
the
circuit
attorney's
office.
petitioner's
wife
testified
that
at
times
petitioner
would
roll
down
a
flight
of
stairs
when
he
didn't
get
his
way.
he
did
this
three
or
four
times
in
a
period
of
8
to
10
years.
as
the
court
of
appeals
stated,
this
simply
demonstrates
the
childish
nature
of
the
petitioner
at
that
times,
but
it
does
not
point
any
incompetency.
also,
petitioner's
wife
signed
a
statement
at
one
time
since
she
felt
that
petitioner
was
mentally
ill,
should
not
go
to
the
trial.
this
was
refuted
doing
the
trial.
she
said
she
signed
that
statement
because
she
want
to
petitioner
to
be
on
the
street,
so
he
could
help
support
the
children
and
her
care
and
concern
was
for
her
children.
and
in
direct
question,
in
direct
answer
to
a
question
by
petitioner's
trial
counsel
as
to
whether
or
not
she
felt
petitioner
was
mentally
ill
after
she
had
talked
with
psychiatrist,
she
said
no
she
did
not.
the
most
troublesome
fact
of
course
in
this
case
is
a
shooting
incident
wherein
the
petitioner
apparently
attempted
to
commit
suicide,
at
least
shot
himself
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
of
trial.
this
in
on
itself
is
of
course
does
not
establish
incompetency
to
proceed
and
i
think
the
fact
surrounding
this
shooting
are
very
important.
the
petitioner
had
sat
through
the
previous
day
testimony
by
his
wife,
alleging
testifying
to
all
of
facts
of
the
crime
itself
and
he
also
heard
testimony
from
people
who
were
at
the
police
station
the
day
following
the
incident
in
which
he
confessed
to
the
crime
and
contended
that
it
had
all
started
out
as
a
joke.
i
think
at
that
point
he
was
well
aware
that
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
against
him
and
that
he
would
probably
be
convicted.
in
such
he
was
a
in
quite
desperate
straits,
but
it
does
show
that
he
was
very
aware
of
the
situation.
petitioner
has
cited
here
on
footnote
several
cases
and
asked
this
court
to
compare
the
fact
situation
therein
all
going
to
the
course
of
competency
to
proceed
with
the
fact
situation
here.
the
state
also
invites
to
court
to
do
this.
there
is
no
general
rule
that
can
be
garnered
from
those
cases,
but
i
think
if
the
court
were
compare
them,
it
will
find
that
in
many
of
those
cases
the
defendants
had
a
long
history
of
mental
illness,
often
coupled
with
violence.
in
one
case
there
was
five
repeated
acts
of
suicide,
in
two
or
more
cases
there
was
legal
adjudication
of
insanity
at
one
time
or
another.
in
several
there
was
incarceration
in
an
asylum
and
in
several
also
the
counsel
for
those
defendants
felt
that
the
defendant
could
not
proceed
to
trial
and
could
not
assist
him
and
consult
with
him
in
a
rational
manner.
i
think
it
is
also
important
in
this
case
to
consider
the
evidence
appear
before
the
court
and
at
what
time
it
appeared
and
i
say
this
because
the
trial
court
had
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
appellant
or
the
petitioner
during
a
day
and
a
half
of
the
trial
before
the
man
shot
himself.
the
trial
court
had
the
opportunity
to
observe
him
consulting
with
his
counsel
and
to
observe
him
as
he
appeared
in
the
courtroom.
i
think
at
that
point
it
would
take
a
little
bit
more
evidence
to
suggest
a
bona
fide
doubt
of
incompetency
and
this
of
course
occurred
just
before
the
shooting
incident.
following
the
trial
in
a
collateral
attack
on
his
conviction
in
a
motion
under
the
missouri
supreme
court
rule
27.26,
two
psychiatrist
testify
and
in
effect
they
were
asked
hypothetical
questions
and
both
stated
that
under
these
facts
they
felt
the
man
should
have
been
psychiatrically
examined.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
those
were
hypothetical
questions
that
neither
while
one
psychiatrist
had
examines
by
petitioner
about
four
months
before
trial
and
that
is
the
examination
contained
in
the
report,
neither
tested
him
for
the
purpose
of
competency.
i
think
a
lay
witness,
if
he
could
be
called
a
witness,
in
this
case
a
trial
judge
was
in
a
better
position
to
observe
that
man
and
to
tell
whether
or
not
it
would
meet
the
dusky
test.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
mr.
chief
justice
he
is
testimony
is
conspicuous
by
his
absence,
but
i
think
petitioner's
counsel
at
this
stage
attempted
to
get
in
touch
with
mr.
watson
and
was
unable
to
do
so.
at
time
of
the
27.26
hearing
mr.
watson
was
quite
ill.
there
was
some
suggestion
that
he
be
deposed,
but
that
never
happened
and
his
thoughts
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
was
incompetent
or
whether
or
not
there
was
a
bona
fide
doubt
as
to
his
competency
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
in
summary
of
point
one
i
would
like
to
emphasize
at
here
we
are
concerned
not
with
mental
illness
or
mental
abnormalities
or
sexual
perversions
or
sociopathic
tendencies,
but
we
are
concerned
with
the
ability
of
the
petitioner
to
understand
the
charge
against
him,
the
facts
against
him,
to
understand
the
proceedings
against
him,
to
consult
with
his
counsel,
to
communicate
and
to
assist
and
aid
in
his
defense.
i
think
if
you
look
through
the
facts,
brought
forth
by
the
petitioner's
counsel
which
at
first
blush
might
suggest
a
bona
fide
doubt
is
to
produce
a
counsel
of
proceed.
a
close
analysis
of
those
facts
indicate
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
your
honor,
he
was
given
a
hearing
at
the
motion
for
new
trial,
on
his
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
went
only
to
absence
from
the
trial,
it
did
not
going
to
his
mental
competency
at
all.
that
perhaps
would
have
been
a
better
way
to
proceed
would
be
to
have,
to
have
mentally
--
give
him
a
mental
examination
or
psychiatric
examination.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
this
is
the
position
of
the
circuit
attorney's
office
in
the
city
of
st.
louis,
either
prosecuting
attorney's
office
could
not
follow
this
policy,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicate
they
would
oppose
it.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
the
court
does
not
have
staff
psychiatric
that
i
know
but
there
are
several
state
hospitals
where
persons
are
sent.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
without
too
much
trouble
your
honor.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes
he
did
your
honor.
his
testimony
begins
on
page
154
of
the
appendix.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
right,
it
was
at
the
hearing
on
the
collateral
tact
of
27.26
motion
and
it
appears
in
that
he
did
examine
the
petitioner
some
four-five
years
previously,
for
some.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
your
honor,
i
think
he
does
and
the
reason
for
this
maybe
that
the
dr.
lum
is
or
was
it
that
time
an
employee
of
the
state,
working
at
malcom
bliss
hospital
and
he
would
test
people,
test
defendants
for
their
competency
so
he
will
be
much
more
aware
of
the
standard
to
be
applied.
he
does
say
on
154
that
the
suicide
attempt
does
indicate
poor
insight
and
judgment.
i
don't
know
if
he
does
state
at
any
place
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no,
no
of
course
it
does
not
your
honor,
and
that
is
a
point
of
the
state
of
missouri
that
there
is
really
nothing
in
the
record
that
points
to
the
lack
of
ability
of
the
petitioner
to
assist
his
counsel
and
to
proceed
in
a
rational
manner.
and
point
number
two
of
course
concerns
the
absence
of
the
petitioner
from
the
trial.
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
at
approximately
8'o
clock
in
the
morning,
the
testimony
shows
that
petitioner
went
to
his
brother's
house
to
get
some
clothes
and
that
he
went
to
the
basement
to
get
his
clothing
and
apparently
there
was
a
rifle
there
and
he
picked
it
up
and
shot
himself.
before
proceeding
with
trial,
the
court
did
conduct
the
hospital
to
check
out
the
explanation
of
petitioner's
absence
as
given
by
his
counsel
and
the
called
the
police
i
believe
and
the
police
checked
and
found
out
that
he
did
shot
himself
apparently
at
attempted
suicide.
the
court
didn't
make
an
effort
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
on
page
63
and
this
was
during
the
trial,
there
was
very
little
on
page
63,
it
just
said
that
the
court
has
already
decided
that
matter
with
proceed
to
trial,
but
then
only
motion
for
new
trial
it
came
out
that
the
court
had
called
the
police
and
police
had
checked
out
the
story
of
petitioner's
trial
counsel
and
they
found
that
he
had
indeed
shot
himself
and
that
he
is
in
the
hospital.
and
one
policeman
inquired
him
of,
asked
him
some
question
at
the
hospital
and
he
indicated
that
he
said
he
rather
be
dead
then
proceed
with
trial.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
they
are
here,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
it
begins
on
page
67,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
on
which
page.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
at
any
rate
the
court
was
aware
of
the
reason
why
the
petitioner
was
absent
from
trial
before
proceeding.
now,
first
in
this
point
the
question
must
be
answered
is
to
whether
not
a
person
in
a
capital
case
can
ever
wave
his
constitutional
right
to
be
present.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
in
this
case,
your
honor,
because
he
could
have
been
sentenced
the
death
sentence
i
think
this
would
be
a
capital
offense.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
right,
right.
the
foundation
case
relied
on
by
petitioner,
the
diaz
case,
a
1912
case
from
this
court
and
the
rule
from
that
case
is
dicta
because
that
was
not
a
capital
case
and
it
was
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
or
not
his
absence
in
a
capital
case
would
be
--
would
violate
his
constitutional
rights.
there
are
many,
many
cases
interpreting
diaz,
but
they
are
all
based
on
the
dictum
from
that
case.
in
that
case,
the
quote
from
that
case
reads,
“that
a
man
who
was
in
custody
cannot
be
held
to
voluntarily
absent
himself
from
trial,
nor
can
one
who
was
charged
with
a
capital
offense
because
he
is
deemed
to
suffer
the
constraint
naturally
incident
to
an
apprehension
of
the
awful
penalty
that
would
follow
conviction.
i
am
not
sure
what
the
constraint
incident
and
apprehension
of
obviously
the
death
penalty
is,
that
would
prevent
him
going
to
trial.
at
any
rate
in
this
case
i
think
the
petitioner's
counsel
or
petitioner
diaz’s
counsel,
he
would
have
been
well
aware
that
the
death
penalty
while
technically
could
have
been
imposed,
as
a
practical
matter
it
would
not
be.
i
say
this
simply
because
of
my
experience
with
the
people
who
are
on
death
row
in
missouri’s
state
penitentiary
prior
to
the
furman
decision
and
there
were
no
people
on
there
who
had
not
committed
very
atrocious
acts
of
homicide,
killing
policeman,
one
person
killed
12
people
at
one
time
and
so
on.
the
death
penalty
while
a
technical
possibility
was
not
practical
and
in
that
respect
i
don’t
think
there
was
any
apprehension
of
the
death
penalty.
i
must
admit
that
its
pure
conjecture,
but
i
think
it
is
accurate
conjecture.
furthermore,
there
is
no
logical
reason
to
differentiate
between
a
person
who
can
absent
himself
during
a
non-capital
offense
and
one
who
does
during
a
capital
offense.
in
either
case,
the
court
would
be
left
at
the
whim
or
caprice
of
the
defendant
who
could
simply
disrupt
the
proceedings
and
stop
the
proceedings
by
absenting
himself
from
the
courtroom.
moreover,
in
this
case
of
course
the
death
penalty
was
not
assessed
or
if
he
did
not
receive
a
capital
sentence
it
is
hard
to
determine
why
the
rule
of
diaz
should
govern.
the
second
part
of
the
question
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
well,
nobody
could
have
been
given
in
the
allan
case
out
of
state
--
illinois
v.
allen
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
i
realize
that
your
honor,
and
allen
was
charged
with
armed
robbery
which
carried
up
to
and
including
a
life
sentence.
so
life
imprisonment
could
have
been
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no.
but
i
think
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
i
realize
that
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
holding
of
this
court
would
be
that
a
man
can
be
absent
from
the
courtroom
in
a
case
where
he
could
be
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
i
think
that’s
an
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
a
voluntary
waiver
of
that
right.
of
course
after
shooting
yourself
must
be
physically
a
voluntary
act.
the
question
than
arises
is
whether
or
not
he
had
the
mental
process,
and
the
mental
powers
to
knowingly
and
voluntarily
waive
that
right.
i
think
if
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no,
there
is
not
your
honor.
i
think
that
would
turn
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
well,
i
think
your
honor,
this
would
turn
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
where
is
it?
mr.
neil
macfarlane
i
think,
your
honor,
we
--
this
would
turn
on
point
number
one
if
he
was
content
to
proceed
with
trial,
if
he
was
aware
of
his
surroundings
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
simply
by
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
your
honor,
simply
by
shooting
himself,
the
act
of
shooting
himself
he
voluntarily
was
--
it
was
a
self
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
the
missouri
does,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
a
policeman
questioned
him
and
he
said
that,
he
would
be
rather
be
dead
than
go
to
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that,
but
he
was
unconscious
during
much
of
the
first
day
when
he
was
taken
and
had
surgery
and
i
think
he
had
surgery
again
perhaps
four
or
five
days
later.
so
probably
he
would
not
have
been
in
a
position
or
in
a
state
of
health
to
have
a
competency
hearing.
mr.
justice
marshall
there
is
some
testimony
on
the
record,
on
the
2726
hearing,
on
cross-examination
of
the
psychiatrist,
the
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
the
judge
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
that
is
all
he
had
your
honor
and
i
am
sure
he
continued
to
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
i
think,
your
honor,
if
i
can
go
to
the
facts
that
the
petitioner’s
counsel
has
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
not
on
that
date
your
honor
but
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
well,
the
record
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
but
it
is
not
in
the
record
on
page
63.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
i
believe,
there
was
your
honor
and
during
the
motion
for
new
trial,
there
was
testimony
that
i
believe
petitioner's
counsel
came
in
and
explained
that
petitioner
had
shot
himself
and
the
court
enlisted
the
help
of
the
police
to
find
out
if
this
were
true
and
where
the
man
was
and
what
his
condition
was.
and
the
court
undoubtedly
knew
that
the
man
had
shot
himself
seriously,
could
not
appear.
and
that
point
the
trial
court
either
had
to
continue
with
the
trial
or
declare
a
mistrial.
i
think
the
trial
court
obviously
felt
the
man
had
voluntarily
made
himself
absent
and
he
commenced
with
the
trial.
of
course
if
--
i
am
sure
that
he
was
under
the
impression
that
if
a
hearing
was
held
later
and
he
was
determined
to
man
to
not
have
the
--
which
hearing
was
not
held,
but
by
going
ahead
with
the
trial
judge
was
placing
the
state
in
this
position.
he
was
completing
the
trial.
if
that
was
constitutional
and
if
later
turned
out
not
to
be,
of
course,
there
would
have
to
be
a
new
trial
but
if
he
declared
a
mistrial,
there
would
be
no
chance
of
in
effect
rescuing
the
trial
and
the
previous
testimony
that
had
gone
on
before
the
court.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
he
certainly
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
that
is
true
your
honor,
as
long
as
the
witnesses
were
still
available.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
the
record
doesn't
indicate.
i
would
think
there
probably
would
have
been
but
i
--
the
petitioner
might
not
have
been
able
to
go
to
trial
for
several
months
either.
he
was
not
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no,
your
honor,
he
went
directly
ahead
with
the
trial.
at
that
point
i
think
he
just
felt
that
the
petitioner
had
voluntarily
made
himself
absent
and
he
felt
he
had
waived
his
right
to
be
there
and
he
continued
with
the
trial.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
that
is
definitely
right
your
honor.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no.
but
there
is
something
in
the
record
that
there
was
a
serious
wound
and
that
he
was
being
--
so
it
would
be
a
matter
of
at
least
several
days.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
so
it
was
--
in
effect
the
matter
of
time
with
the
jury
could
not
be
sent
home
and
brought
back.
it
was
either
a
mistrial
or
could
continue
with
the
trial.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
if
you
would
say
that
the
state
had
the
initial
burden
your
honor,
i
think
that
shifted
as
soon
as
he
was
proven
that
the
man
shot
himself.
i
think
then
it
is
a
presumption
of
voluntary
waiver.
it
was
his
own
act
that
made
him
absent
from
the
trail.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
i
don't
if
he
expressly
stated
that,
but
that
would
be
effect
of
his
ruling.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
not
so
much
as
to
his
history,
your
honor.
it
would
be
more
to
the
–
the
motion
for
new
trial
involved
his
absence
from
the
trial.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no,
this
was
involved
somewhat
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
right,
this
was
involved
somewhat
in
the
27.26
mode
in
the
hearing.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no,
there
were
two
--
there
was
motion
of
new
trail
hearing
and
a
27.26
hearing
which
is
a
state
habeas
corpus.
it
was
at
the
27.26
hearing
that
doctors
lum
and
shuman
testified.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
two
years
later,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
just
from
the
hospital
where
he
went
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
there
was
an
opportunity
i
suppose.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
he
certainly
could
have,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
that
was
the
statement
by
the
court
at
the
time.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
as
a
practical
matter
there
was
no
testimony
put
on
at
that
time
of
course.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
do
you
mean,
later
your
honor
or
after
the
trail?
mr.
neil
macfarlane
i
think
the
court
would
have
allowed
it,
if
there
was
testimony
to
be
--
mr.
neil
macfarlane
he
said
that
after
having
a
discussion
in
chambers.
so
there
would
have
been
an
opportunity,
but
it
would
have
been
prior
to
that
statement.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
yes,
it
certainly
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
neil
macfarlane
no,
your
honor.
it
simply
went
to
his
absence
from
trial
not
as
to
his
mental
ability
to
voluntary
wave
his
right
to
be
present.
thank
you.
