justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
walsh
you
don't
have
to
go
as
far
to
say
that
under
any
circumstances?
suppose
the
bailee
goes
out
to
lunch
and
has
one
too
many
drinks
and
he
is
drunk,
what
happens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
can
or
must?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
this
case,
i
am
trying
to
say,
in
this
case,
you
don't
have
go
that
far
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
why
you
need
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
have
a
staff
psychiatrist
on
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
have
been
done
very
easily.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
case
in
which
life
imprisonment
was
given
in
absentia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
allen
was
the
man
in
the
courtroom,
wrecking
the
courtroom.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
didn’t
absent
himself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
absented
by
the
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
this
man
did
was
to
try
to
commit
suicide
and
he
didn’t
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
voluntarily
giving
up
his
right
to
be
tried
in
his
presence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
johnson
against
zerbest
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
the
intelligent
waiver?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
his
waiver,
or
his
right
to
be
present.
where
did
he
consciously
waive
the
right
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
his
own
trial
waiting
to
get
life
imprisonment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
voluntarily
shot
himself
for
what
reason?
you
don’t
know
and
the
judge
didn’t
know.
and
in
this
record
the
judge
says
is
forget
about
it,
he
didn’t
make
any
effort
to
find
out
whether
man
wanted
to
try
and
be
there
or
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
what
basis
the
judge
had
at
the
time
that
he
decided
to
go
without
him,
what
did
the
judge
have
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
answer
is
nothing
but
the
statement
that
the
man
had
tried
to
commit
suicide?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
except
for
this
that
the
judge
says,
he
says
i
am
a
judge
in
the
court,
i
would
decided
--
the
court
has
already
decided
that
the
matter
would
proceed
to
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
way
to
hold
a
hearing,
where
the
judge
has
already
made
up
his
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
stuck
with
the
facts
on
page
63.
have
you
got
any
others
in
the
record
on
that
date?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
what
we
are
dealing
with.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
judge
had
before
him
to
show
that
this
man
had
voluntarily
waived
his
rights,
is
there
anything
as
of
that
moment
that
told
the
judge
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
could
grant
a
mistrial
and
try
him
when
he
got
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
only
thing
missouri
would
have
lost
was
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
they
available
21
days
later?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't
even
delay
one
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
the
record
that
said
he
wouldn't
be
out
for
21
days?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
says
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
asked
for
a
mistrial,
that's
what
he
had
asked
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
was
denied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
didn't,
he
said,
i
have
already
made
up
my
mind.
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
he
have
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
do
it
in
phase
of
this?
the
court
already
has
decided
that
the
matter
would
proceed
for
trial
you
mean
then
he
could
have
put
on
a
testimony?
is
that
what
the
court
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
could
you
then
put
on
a
testimony
after
that
statement
by
the
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
it
have
been
that
the
judge
said
that
i
have
already
made
up
my
mind?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
after
he
said,
i
have
already
made
up
my
mind?
you
said,
when
the
judge
has
already
made
up
my
mind,
you
sit
down.
