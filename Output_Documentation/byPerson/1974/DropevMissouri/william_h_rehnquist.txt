justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
from
which
you
have
certiorari
now,
regard
both
of
those
issues
as
open
for
it's
consideration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
contend
that
if
anyone
is
said
to
be
in
need
of
psychiatric
help
the
trial
can't
proceed
until
a
psychiatrist
gives
his
okay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
factual
inquiry
would
that
be?
supposing
that
a
man
on
trial
for
a
capital
offense,
simply
jumps
bail
and
absconds.
now
will
he
be
heard
to
say
when
he
gets
back,
that
although
he
knew
he
was
leaving
the
court
and
he
wouldn't
be
there
for
trail,
he
really
didn't
intend
to
waive
his
right
of
confrontation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that's
okay,
but
how
long
do
you
hold
the
jury
in
a
case
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
it's
a
very
difficult
question,
i
am
interested
in
your
answer
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
simply
by
absconding
he
can
abort
the
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah
in
a
capital
case
by
absconding
he
can
abort
the
trial.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
the
court
in
pate
when
using
the
word
bona
fide
doubt
simply
referring
to
a
provision
in
the
illinois
statute?
they
weren't
laying
--
the
bona
fide
doubt
wasn't
imposed
as
a
constitutional
test,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
define
a
capital
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
where
a
death
penalty
might
be
imposed
under
this
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
missouri
ever
apply
the
rule
that
a
man
is
presumed
to
intend
the
natural
consequences
of
his
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
presume
at
that
point
there
would
have
been
utterly
no
point
of
delaying
it
for
one
day
since
the
advice
was
that
he
wouldn't
be
out
of
the
hospital
for
21
days?
