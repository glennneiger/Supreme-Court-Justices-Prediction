mr.
walsh
who
was
the
state
judge?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
are
cases
where
psychiatric
testimony
is
on
one
side,
and
lay
testimony
on
the
other,
and
the
court
has
decided
to
favor
the
lay
testimony
and
on
appeal
it
has
been
upheld.
this
is
dusky
itself
in
the
later
chapter.

dusky
is
also
out
of
missouri,
isn't
it?

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument
in
the
state
where
there
was
no
capital
punishment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr
macfarlane
i
suppose
that
the
easiest
thing
to
do
would
have
been
to
give
him
the
examination
promptly
at
the
course
of
the
trial
as
mr.
justice
white
suggests
than
we
wouldn't
have
the
case
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
the
state
oppose
at
that
time
or
statement
was
made
that
the
state
was
willing
to
have
the
examination
pre
trial
and
is
this
always
been
in
state's
position?
