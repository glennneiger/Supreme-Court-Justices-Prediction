mr.
walsh,
if
the
motion
for
mistrial
had
been
made
and
granted
by
the
court,
would
jeopardy
have
attached?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
actually,
the
motion
here
was
upon
acquittal
rather
than
a
mistrial
as
i
read
the
read
the
record?

right,
but
if
you
look
over
the
next
page,
middle
of
page,
“the
defendant
requests
the
court
for
verdict
of
acquittal.”
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
don't
think
that's
different
from
motion
on
63?
