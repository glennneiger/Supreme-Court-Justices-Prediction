mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
in
forma
pauperis
case
come
to
this
court
on
certiorari
to
the
missouri
state
court
system.
this
is
a
state
court
post
conviction
proceeding
in
which
the
petitioner
james
drope
is
challenging
the
life
sentence
imposed
upon
him
in
1969
by
the
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
st.
louis
for
the
somewhat
bizarre
and
improbable
crime
of
raping
his
own
wife.
there
are
two
issues
presented
by
our
petition
in
this
case.
first
is
whether
the
petitioner
was
unconstitutionally
denied
his
right
to
a
psychiatric
exam
to
determine
his
competency
to
proceed
with
his
trial
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
of
pate
v.
robinson,
particularly
in
light
of
his
mental
history
and
his
attempted
suicide
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
the
second
question
is
whether
he
was
unconstitutionally
tried
in
absentia,
following
the
suicide
attempt
which
caused
him
to
be
hospitalized
for
surgery,
and
therefore,
to
miss
remainder
of
the
trial.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes
it
did
mr.
justice,
absolutely.
it's
our
position
that
to
state
the
facts
of
this
case
is
to
resolve
the
first
issue
presented.
it's
unnecessary
i
think
to
dwell
upon
the
somewhat
sordid
details
of
the
crime
itself.
it's
suffice
to
say
that
the
petitioner
and
four
of
his
so
called
friends
were
charged
with
raping
the
petitioner's
wife
in
january
of
1969.
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
that
first
of
all
his
wife
thought
that
the
petitioner
was
mentally
ill
and
she
signed
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
she
did
not
want
to
prosecute
him
and
she
thought
he
should
have
psychiatric
care.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
the
question
here
your
honor
is
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt
about
the
competency
to
stand
trial
in
a
court.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
think
there
is
ground
for
claim
that
there
is
a
distinction.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
tired
in
the
first
place,
yes
your
honor,
but
the
only
question
here
on
the
first
point
is
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
doubt
under
pate
against
robinson.
now,
in
addition
to
the
wife's
testimony,
before
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
trial
was
a
report
of
the
psychiatrist
which
was
made
within
a
month
of
the
transaction
or
the
occurrence
which
was
the
subject
of
the
prosecution.
dr.
chuman
was
the
psychiatrist
who
was
seen
by
the
petitioner
at
the
suggestion
of
his
counsel.
that
report
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix
at
pages
8
to
13.
i
think
its
important
to
analyze
what
dr.
chuman
said.he
examined
the
petitioner
for
an
hour
and
a
half
and
he
found
that
the
petitioner
was
markedly
agitated.
he
was
suffering
from
marked
anxiety.
he
was
having
difficulty
in
talking.
he
told
the
doctor
that
he
heard
voices
from
time
to
time.
he
saw
visions
of
dead
people
and
he
sometimes
had
conversations
with
them.
he
had
a
difficult
time
relating.
he
was
circumstantial
and
irrelevant
in
his
speech
and
he
certainly
needs
the
aid
of
a
psychiatrist,
said
dr.
chuman.
he
was
found
to
be
very
neurotic
individual
with
sociopathic
personality,
suffering
from
sexual
perversion,
borderline
mental
deficiency
and
chronic
anxiety
reaction
with
depression.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
examination
was
on
february
20,
the
trial
was
in
june.
the
this
report
was
attached
to
a
motion
for
continuance
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
a
psychiatric
examination
under
missouri
chapter
552.
however,
when
the
case
was
assigned
for
trial,
and
i
might
add,
the
state
of
missouri
consented
to
that
motion,
consented
to
an
exam,
but
when
the
case
was
assigned
for
trial,
there
was
some
misunderstanding
about
the
trial
date.
petitioner's
counsel
indicated
that
he
thought
that
the
motion
had
been
granted
and
the
case
was
going
to
be
continued
to
the
september
term.
however,
it
was
on
the
docket
in
june,
it
was
called
and
assigned
to
division,
and
when
it
was
assigned,
petitioner's
counsel
was
not
there.
he
showed
up
later
that
day,
and
the
trial
judge
who
was
plainly
irritated
at
counsel,
refused
at
that
point
to
grant
a
continuance
or
a
psychiatric
exam,
and
ordered
the
trial
to
begin
immediately.
at
that
point,
counsel
in
the
record,
specifically
stated
that
he
was
protesting
against
going
to
trial
under
those
circumstances
because
his
client
was
not
fit
to
proceed
and
should
be
given
a
psychiatric
exam.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
state
judge
was
david
mcmillan
of
circuit
court
of
the
city
of
st
louis
mr.
justice
and
at
that
point,
a
specific
record
was
made
by
the
counsel
against
proceeding,
but
the
trial
commenced
at
that
point.
now,
at
the
trial
which
started
in
the
afternoon
of
june
23
with
the
swearing
of
the
jury,
the
evidence
was
began
on
the
june,
24.
the
victim,
the
petitioner's
wife
testified
about
the
details
of
the
rape
and
she
also
testified
from
the
stand
that
she
felt
that
her
husband
was
mentally
sick
and
in
need
of
psychiatric
care.
she
testified
that,
from
time
to
time
when
he
didn't
get
his
way,
he
would
roll
down
the
stairs
to
manifest
his
displeasure.
the
state's
case
was
not
concluded
on
the
24
and
on
the
morning
of
the
25,
the
next
day
when
the
court
convened,
the
petitioner
was
not
there.
he
was
on
bond
and
the
court
was
advised,
evidently
by
telephone,
that
he
had
been
shot.
he
had
shot
himself
with
the
.22
that
morning
and
had
been
taken
to
city
hospital
in
st.
louis
and
he
was
undergoing
surgery.
it
was
called
at
that
time
a
suicide
attempt.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
this
was
--
the
trial
began
in
the
afternoon
of
the
23
with
the
swearing
of
the
jury.
evidence
had
been
taken
on
the
24,
and
this
was
the
morning
of
the
25.
the
state
had
not
concluded
it's
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
state
still
had
four
witnesses
to
go.
what
he
apprehended
i
am
not
quite
sure
to
mr.
justice,
but
in
any
event
he
shot
himself
in
the
morning
and
was
obviously
unable
to
attempt
the
rest
of
the
trail.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
twenty
one
days,
mr.
justice.
he
was
operated
on
twice
and
he
was
twenty
one
days
in
the
hospital
before
he
was
released.
now
at
this
point,
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
moved
for
a
mistrial,
saying
he
had
no
client,
and
he
could
not
continue
with
the
trial,
but
the
trial
judge
without
a
hearing
or
without
any
examination
of
the
situation
other
than
the
telephone
call
he
had
received,
summarily
ruled
that
he
--
that
the
petitioner
brought
this
on
himself
and
that
the
trial
will
proceed
and
the
trial
did
proceed
over
this
objection.
the
state
called
four
more
witnesses.
the
state
put
on
proof
of
the
petitioner's
prior
1958
conviction
for
burglary.
there
was
argument
of
course
in
instruction
of
the
jury
and
a
finding
of
guilty
was
returned
by
the
jury.
and
subsequent
to
that
under
the
missouri
second
offender
statute,
the
court
imposed
the
life
sentence
upon
the
petitioner.
that
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
missouri
supreme
court
on
direct
appeal
and
then
the
petitioner
filed
this
proceeding
under
missouri
state
post-conviction
law
which
is
missouri
rule
27.26,
the
counterpart
of
habeas
corpus
and
counsel
was
appointed
to
represent
him
at
that
stage.
at
the
hearing
on
the
27.26
motion,
we
brought
in
two
psychiatrists
who
testified
that
a
person
having
the
symptoms
and
behaving
like
the
petitioner
did,
was
in
need
of
psychiatric
care
and
there
was
at
least
a
reasonable
doubt
about
his
ability
to
proceed
with
trial
and
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
proceeding.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
they
never
actually
examined
him.
this
was
in
hypothetical
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
they
didn't
examine
them
before,
in
this
we
have
to
proceed
hypothetically.
nevertheless,
in
spite
of
this
rather
abundant
record
i
think
of
at
least
a
doubt
about
his
competency,
both
to
proceed
and
to
excuse
himself
from
the
trial,
that
same
trail
judge
who
ruled
on
trial
matters,
overruled
the
motion
under
rule
27.26
for
post
conviction
relief
and
that
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
missouri
court
of
appeals.
it
is
that
decision
which
is
here
for
review
today.
the
first
point
as
to
the
reasonable
doubt
about
his
competency
to
proceed,
we
think
is
squarely
ruled
by
this
court's
decision
and
pate
against
robinson.
as
i
said
if
there
is
a
bona
fide
doubt
about
competency,
then
a
hearing
must
be
had
to
determine
whether
he
is
fit
to
proceed
and
the
test
of
competency
is
set
forth
in
this
court's
dusky
opinion,
dusky
versus
united
states
and
it's
two-fold.
does
he
have
a
sufficient
ability
to
consult
with
his
lawyer
with
a
reasonable
degree
of
understanding
and
secondly,
does
he
have
a
rational
and
a
factual
understanding
of
the
proceedings.
now,
this
record
is
full
of
denials
by
the
trial
judge
of
specific
request
for
a
psychiatric
exam.
he
ignored
the
report
of
dr.
chuman.
he
ignored
his
wife's
testimony
that
this
men
needed
psychiatric
help
and
finally,
he
ignored
the
suicide
attempt
as
it
bore
upon
his
mental
state.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
don't
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
if
he
is
in
a
need
of
psychiatric
help,
i
think
you
have
to
ask
a
psychiatrist
to
determine
whether
he
is
in
fact
competent
to
proceed,
whether
whatever
is
wrong
with
him
will
prevent
him
from
understanding
the
nature
of
the
proceedings
and
assisting
counsel.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
may
well
be,
your
honor,
but
we
should
have
had
that
opportunity
here
to
have
a
psychiatrist
tell
us
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
one
of
many
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
absolutely,
one
of
many
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
when
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
as
a
general
rule,
i
don't
know
that,
that
is
--
i
think
that
is
the
practice
in
the
federal
courts.
if
a
motion
is
made
for
a
psychiatric
exam,
i
think
one
is
ordered
to
avoid
problem
just
like
that,
that
we
have
here.
but
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
have
much
more
than
that.
we
have
a
psychiatrist
report
saying
this
man
has
difficult
time
relating.
he's
circumstantial
and
irrelevant
in
his
speech.
he
has
trouble
talking.
that
certainly
should
have
alerted
the
court
that
he
is
going
to
have
trouble
communicating
with
counsel,
and
understanding
what's
going
on.
the
question
again,
and
i
hate
to
keep
harping
on
this,
but
this
is
the
rule
of
pate.
it's
a
question
whether
there
is
a
doubt,
and
i
think
when
a
charge
is
made
that
a
man
is
mentally
ill
and
needs
the
help
of
the
psychiatrist,
i
don't
think
the
trial
judge
himself
can
resolve
the
question
of
whether
the
defect
this
man
has
prevents
from
being
able
to
proceed
or
not.
i
think
that
is
for
the
psychiatrist
to
determine.
i
think
that's
what
pate
holds
and
the
moore
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
says
that
when
this
doubt
is
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that's
right,
yes
mr.
justice,
but
again,
he
is
entitled
constitutionally
to
that
psychiatric
exam
and
then
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no,
well
i
don't
think
we
have
to
get
to
that
in
facts
to
this
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
am
not
aware,
i
don't
know.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
alright,
okay.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
second
issue
presented
by
this
case
arises
under
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
as
made
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
arises
out
of
the
problem
created
by
the
continuation
of
the
trial
in
petitioner's
absence
after
his
attempted
suicide
on
the
morning
of
june
25,
1969.
the
petitioner
is
on
trial
as
i
mentioned
for
rape
which
is
punishable
by
death
in
the
state
of
missouri
and
was
punishable
by
death
at
that
time,
being
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
furman
against
georgia
and
the
death
penalty
had
not
been
waived
by
the
state.
therefore,
our
position
is
that
since
this
was
a
capital
case,
according
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
dating
back
to
1800s,
the
right
to
be
present
and
to
confront
one's
witnesses
in
a
capital
case
cannot
be
waived
and
therefore,
to
continue
the
trial
in
the
petitioner's
absence
was
a
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
to
my
knowledge,
this
court
has
never
upheld
the
conviction
of
a
defendant
who
was
absent
in
a
capital
case
during
a
major
portion
of
this
trial.
and
as
will
be
recalled
here,
the
defendant
miss
the
testimony
of
four
witnesses,
the
proof
of
his
prior
conviction,
the
final
arguments,
the
instructions,
and
the
verdict
itself.
the
rule
of
diaz
against
united
states,
1912,
recognizes
the
necessity
of
the
defendant's
right
to
confront
his
witnesses
in
a
capital
case
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
i
think
that's
the
state
of
the
law
as
i
understand
it
today,
mr.
justice.
i
recognize
that
illinois
v.
allen
made
some
inroads
perhaps
on
that
rule,
and
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
that's
a
different
case
actually
because
you
don't
have
a
situation
here
where
you
have
a
contemptible
defendant
who
is
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
right
and
as
your
concurring
opinion
mentioned,
he
had
the
right
to
reclaim
his
right
to
be
present
at
any
time
he
indicated
his
willingness
to.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
think
that's
my
understanding
of
the
state
of
law
and
criminal
rule
43,
i
think
recognizes
that
as
the
dictum
from
diaz,
i
concede
that
but
the
hop
case
in
1880s
and
the
louis
case
of
that
era,
i
think
stands
equally
for
that
proposition
and
it
has
never
been
overruled.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well
i
don't
know
that
to
be
effect,
mr,
chief
justice
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
just
don't
know,
but
i
don't
think
the
wording
of
the
diaz
opinion
indicates
that
was
the
major
consideration.
they
were
really
two
cases
in
which
the
defendant
was
not
deemed
capable
of
waiving
his
right.
one
was
when
he
was
in
custody
under
diaz
and
the
other
was
when
he
was
on
trial
for
capital
crime
and
it
said,
i
think
the
language
that
usually
in
custody,
but
i
don't
know
whether
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well
i
–
in
those
circumstances,
i
think
if
it's
a
capital
case,
there
are
procedures
whereby
the
case
can
be
continued
for
a
day
perhaps
to
allow
him
to
regain
his
senses
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well
i
think
should,
must
under
those
circumstances.
i
recognize
that's
a
rather
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that's
correct,
i
think
even
if
we
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well
i
think
even
in
this
case
mr.
justice,
if
we
assume
that
the
right
is
waiverable,
and
i
am
prepared
to
do
that,
and
still
we
contend
that
the
petitioner
here
was
denied
his
right
to
be
present,
because
(a)
there
was
no
meaningful
evaluation
made
of
whether
his
absence
from
the
courtroom
was
voluntary
or
involuntary
and
(b)
the
missouri
state
court
placed
the
burden
on
him
of
proving
that
it
was
involuntary.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
precisely
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
state
courts
presumed
that
that
his
absence
was
voluntary,
and
held
therefore
that
it
was
voluntary
without
giving
him
--
held
it
was
voluntary
because
he
had
not
sustained
the
burden
that
it
wasn't,
and
all
this
was
done
without
reference
to
his
mental
state,
and
an
inquiry
has
to
whether
in
fact
he
was
capable
of
making
a
conscious
knowing
voluntary
choice
not
to
be
present
and
to
waive
his
right.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
i
think
what
should
have
been
done
is
that
a
mistrial
should
have
been
declared
as
the
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it
was
asked
for
yes
and
i
think
it
should
have
been
declared
under
these
circumstances.
all
the
court
did,
was
say
well
he
shot
himself.
he
made
the
choice
not
to
be
here
let's
go.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
have
to
say,
i
think
that
would
be
a
reasonable
procedure,
if
the
burden
were
appropriately
placed
and
the
presumptions
were
correct,
and
his
mental
state
was
inquired
into,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
there
was
no
examination
of
his
ability
to
make
a
choice,
but
the
court
did
find
it
was
voluntary
having
erroneously
reversed
the
burden.
we
think
under
schneckloth
versus
bustamonte
and
johnson
v.
zerbst
the
court
has
said
that
the
court
should
indulge
every
reasonable
presumption
against
the
waiver
of
constitutional
rights
and
the
right
of
confrontation
of
course
is
squarely
included
among
those
and
without
a
finding
that
he
intentionally
and
knowingly
waived
his
right,
it
was
error
to
proceed
to
try
him.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
your
honor
i
think,
if
the
defendant
just
disappears
from
the
courtroom
and
doesn't
come
back,
i
think
the
court
has
to
take
some
steps
to
find
him
before
any
determination
can
be
made
of
whether
his
absence
is
voluntary
or
involuntary,
he
could
had
a
heart
attack,
he
could
have
been
hit
by
a
car.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well
that's
a
difficult
question.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
i
would
think
that
until
a
determination
can
be
made
whether
his
absence
is
voluntary
or
involuntary
you
have
to
hold
the
jury
and
if
that's
going
to
require
too
much
time,
you
have
to
declare
a
mistrial.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
am
talking
about
a
capital
case
now.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
now
that
would
be
my
position.
i
recognize
the
taylor
against
united
states
in
a
non-capital
case,
said
that,
that's
not
correct,
but
there
it
was
conceded
that
he
absence
was
voluntary.
but
in
the
absence
of
any
determination
or
any
ability
to
make
a
determination
whether
it's
voluntary
or
involuntary,
i
don't
think
the
trial
can
proceed
unless
perhaps
the
procedure
suggested
by
mr.
justice
white
for
a
hearing
immediately
after
the
trial
would
suffice.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
diaz
case
arose
in
the
philippines,
but
as
i
read
it
is
a
federal
constitutional
case.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
as
i
read
diaz
i
think
there
is
some
grounds
for
difference
of
opinion
as
there
is
a
lot
of
reference
to
philippine
law
in
there
and
it's
not
completely
clear,
frankly.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
not,
the
absolute
non
waivability
argument,
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
absolutely
yes.
but,
as
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
right
is
absolutely
non
waivable,
we
would
not
make
that
argument
if
this
were
not
a
capital
case.
in
summary,
we
missourians
are
proud
of
our
missouri
state
court
system
and
justifiably
so,
but
in
this
case
we
think
something
went
radically
wrong
with
the
justice.
and
the
missouri
courts
in
their
anxiety
to
keep
this
petitioner
off
the
streets,
stepped
on
his
constitutional
rights,
and
we
think
the
remedy
of
this
court
in
the
pate
case
is
the
appropriate
disposition
of
this
matter
namely,
to
reverse
and
remand
the
judgment
with
orders
to
vacate
the
conviction
and
to
discharge
the
petitioner
unless
he
can
be
tried,
retried
within
a
reasonable
time.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all
with
respect
to
the
state's
argument
that
the
request
for
a
psychiatric
examination
was
not
in
proper
form.
the
fact
is
that
there
is
no
form
as
such
under
missouri
law
and
missouri
practice.
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
clearly
stated
in
the
record
that
he
objected
to
going
forward,
because
his
man
was
not
competent
to
proceed
and
needed
a
psychiatric
evaluation
and
a
hearing.
further
more
in
the
pate
against
robinson
case,
this
court
noted
that
a
motion
isn't
even
necessary,
if
facts
come
before
the
court
which
indicate
a
reasonable
doubt
then
the
court
sua
sponte
must
order
a
hearing
under
missouri
law
an
examination.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
sir.
yes.
here,
of
course
they
had
agreed
that
such
an
examination
and
hearing
would
be
appropriate,
yet
it
was
denied.
secondly
the
state
in
it's
brief
and
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
in
it's
opinion
failed
to
come
to
grips
with
the
overall
composite
picture
that
was
before
the
trial
court,
as
regards
to
the
defendants
mental
state.
they
have
isolated
each
one
of
these
instance
and
tried
to
minimize
it's
significance,
rather
than
looking
at
the
overall
picture
which
portrays
something
less
than
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
the
issue
of
competency
was
not
presented
at
the
motion
for
new
trial
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
the
defendant's
testimony
was
that
he
didn't
remember
shooting
himself,
he
had
blacked
out.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that's
correct
mr.
justice,
and
i
might
add
that,
that
failure
of
his
counsel
was
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
we
asserted
that
the
incompetency
of
counsel
on
that
matter
and
in
the
missouri
supreme
court
on
direct
appeal
that
point
has
been
abandoned
in
this
court,
but
we
do
feel
that
he
seriously
overlooked
that
point
at
that
stage.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
not
under
any
rule
that
i
am
aware
of
mr.
justice
powell.
the
missouri
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
felt
that
might
be
a
problem,
but
it
relied
on
the
jorn
case
which
was
poles
apart
from
this
case
and
which
was
a
case
where
the
defense
didn't
even
request
a
mistrial.
but
here
if
the
action
--
the
mistrial
is
caused
by
the
defendants
action,
i
don't
think
he
is
in
very
good
position
for
double
jeopardy
if
he
is
re-prosecuted.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
at
the
time
the
trial
proceeded
in
his
absence?
no,
i
would
characterize
it
as
a
motion
for
mistrial.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
page
63,
mr.
justice,
at
the
top,
your
honor
at
this
time
i
am
going
to
move
for
a
mistrial
in
view
of
the
fact
that
defendant
i
am
informed
shot
himself
this
morning.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that
is
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict
following
the
receipt
of
all
the
evidence.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes
sir.
that
is
about
40
or
30
pages
of
transcript
deleted
there
between
those
two
passages
of
additional
testament.
one
other
point
if
i
may,
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
the
court
found
or
attempted
to
find
that
the
petitioner
was
actively
cooperating
with
his
counsel
during
the
course
of
this
trial.
the
record
is
totally
silent
on
this
subject
and
i
think
pate
against
robinson
minimizes
any
such
finding
if
one
would
have
been
made
anyway.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
at
the
time
when
the
27.26
hearing
was
being
held,
the
defense
counsel
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that's
the
post
conviction
matter.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
right,
it's
habeas
corpus.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no
sir.
that,
that
mental
issue
was
not
raised
at
that
time.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
presumably
and
why
he
abandoned
the
competency
issue
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
not
of
inability
to
communicate
or
to
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
at
--
several
months
after
the
trial
and
after
the
shooting,
is
that
what
you
are
referring
to?
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
yes,
which
was
--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
it
was
about
three
or
four
months
after
he
had
healed
and
was
out
of
the
hospital.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
i
think
it
is
but
--
and
i
don't
understand
why
he
didn't
do
that
frankly.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that's
correct.
i
think
the
--
but
there
is
a
problem
created
in
the
record
by
the
psychiatrist
report
which
specifically
talked
about
this
man's
difficulty
in
communicating,
having
trouble
in
talking
being
a
relevant
and
not
having
a
good
memory
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
i
do
not
have
an
answer
for
why
counsel
did
not
raise
it.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
my
pleasure,
mr.
chief
justice.
