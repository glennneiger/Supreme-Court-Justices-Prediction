the
13d
has
to
be
filed
with
the
company
and
with
the
exchange
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
with
the
commission.
justice
potter
stewart
and
where
else
if
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
the
shareholders
readily
and
promptly
get
knowledge
of
this?
justice
potter
stewart
neither
the
commissioner
of
the
exchange
normally
makes
any
effort
to
disseminate
the
information
to
the
shareholder.
justice
potter
stewart
and
would
--
it
would
often
be
seemed
to
be
and
management's
interest
to
publicize
it
too.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
schedule?
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
institution.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
among
himself
and
these
various
corporations.
justice
potter
stewart
would
the
amendment
for
the
first
time
indicate
that
his
purpose
might
be
the
acquisition
of
control
of
the
company?
justice
potter
stewart
has
there
been
any
litigation
by
any
of
the
shareholders
who
sold
their
stock
to
your
client
after
may
and
before
august?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
class,
the
asserted
class
is
the
shareholders
who
sold
their
stock
to
mr.
rondeau
from
the
time
of
his
violation
until
the
time
he
made
that
13d.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
i
suppose
was
a
--
had
been
irrelatively
inactive
over
the
counter
market
for
this
type?
justice
potter
stewart
340,
isn't
it,
under
the
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
whether
it's
precedent
or
not
in
that
circuit,
it
is
at
least
arguably
a
conflict
in
point
of
view.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
people
are
the
plaintiffs
in
this
--
aren't
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
like
as
conceded,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
violated
the
law
that
it
clearly
--
justice
potter
stewart
expressly,
explicitly
violated
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
they
were,
they
no
longer
are.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hammond
would
your
client,
the
mosinee
would
have
a
reaction
for
money
damages?
justice
potter
stewart
you
didn't
ask
for
damages.
justice
potter
stewart
you
ask.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
just
drop
out
of
the
case,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
cases
of
course
in
--
or
are
they
not
under
this
statute
where
money
damages
have
been
allowed
to
shareholders.
justice
potter
stewart
where
the
damage
is
relatively
easy
to
prove.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
make
the
course
of
action
a
judicial
creation
in
any
way?
justice
potter
stewart
the
statement
of
facts
in
petitioner's
brief
says
that
mr.
forester,
his
wife
and
trust
managed
by
him
were
--
like
to
live
the
largest
shareholders
in
mosinee,
you
would
agree
that's
true?
