mr.

does
the
record
show
what
percentage
of
the
stock
in
mosinee
paper
company
is
owned
or
controlled
by
management
using
management
to
include
the
board
of
directors
and
officers?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
we
conceived
50%?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

what
percentage?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
percentage
would
you
regard
as
evidence
of
control?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
sec
used
the
figure
10%
in
good
many
context,
are
you
talking
about
25%?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
hammond,
broadly
speaking
there
are
two
categories
of
stockholders,
those
who
are
in
management
as
i
have
indicated
5449
and
just
to
run
on
the
stockholder
who
owns
a
stock
as
an
investment,
it
isn't
clear
to
me
from
what
you've
said
so
far
has
a
latter
category
about
stockholders
will
benefit
if
you
win
this
case
or
even
with
benefit
from
you
bringing
it.
i
can
perceive
how
management
if
they
be
in
entirely
different
category
because
in
chelating
3%
of
the
stock
from
participating
in
voting
would
tend
to
infringe
management
but
focus
your
response
to
my
question
on
the
non-management
stockholders.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
they
transferred
their
shareholders
who
aren't
entirely
5632
by
management.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
who
might
welcome
attend
to
up?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
one
of
the
premises
of
the
williams
act,
isn't
it?
