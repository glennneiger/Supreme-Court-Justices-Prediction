mr.
david
e.beckwith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
what
is
the
appropriate
judgment
to
enter
at
this
time
for
the
violation
of
--
for
a
violation
of
the
williams
act
which
occurred
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
1971.
the
district
court
western
district
of
wisconsin,
judge
doyle
determined
in
19
--
february
of
1973
that
the
appropriate
judgment
was
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
this
was
pursuant
to
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
in
july
of
1974
directing
the
district
court
to
enter
an
order
sterilizing
3%
of
the
stock
of
the
defendant
mr.
rondeau
for
a
period
of
five
years
and
permanently
enjoining
mr.
rondeau
from
further
violations.
the
williams
act
as
you
know
amended
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
in
essence
it
provides
that
a
shareholder
who
requires
more
than
5%
of
the
shares
of
a
covered
company
and
that
figure
incidentally
was
10%
until
december
31,
1970
approximately
6
months
before
the
violation.
a
shareholder
requires
more
than
5%
as
required
to
file
a
schedule
13d
which
sets
forth
his
identity,
sources
of
financing
purpose
and
other
manners.
it
is
a
notice
statute.
it
is
designed
to
give
management
and
other
shareholders
a
notice
of
accumulation
of
stock.
it
sets
the
rules
of
contest
for
tender
offers
and
pretender
offer
conduct.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
yes.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
correct.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
that's
all.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
usually
through
information
from
management
if
it
is
filed
and
has
a
pretender
offer
matter.
it
can
come
through
publicity
generally
if
it
is
picked
up
--
for
filing
is
picked
up.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
that's
correct
but
of
course
the
exchange
and
the
commission
do
have
rules
regarding
what
management
must
publicize
and
this
might
be
considered
such
relevant
information
and
management
might
be
required
to
publicize
in
certain
circumstances.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
it
might
be.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
the
district
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
issue
of
material
fact
as
to
the
propositions
which
it
included
in
its
opinion
under
the
heading
facts.
that
matter
was
strenuously
contested
on
appeal
as
judge
pell's
dissent
indicates
but
both
the
majority
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
dissent
judge
pell
agreed
with
judge
doyle
that
summary
judgment
was
appropriate
and
that
the
facts
were
not
--
the
operative
facts
were
not
immaterial
dispute.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
that
is
my
position
and
that
is
the
way
he
states
it.
that
matter
has
been
raised
again
here
by
respondents.
we
think
improperly
because
no
cross
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed.
the
facts
as
stated
by
judge
doyle
are
essentially
these.
most
and
is
a
company
in
central
wisconsin
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
pulp
and
paper
is
located
in
a
small
community
mosinee
near
wasa.
mr.
rondeau
was
a
businessman
in
mosinee.
his
business
is
a
cold
storage
and
cheese
manufacture.
he
operates
several
companies,
some
of
which
bare
his
name
and
all
of
which
are
clearly
identified
with
him
and
those
smaller
communities.
he
began
to
purchase
mosinee
stock
in
april
of
1971
because
he
thought
it
to
be
a
good
investment.
by
may
17,
his
holdings
had
exceeded
5%.
he
had
over
40,000
shares
and
40,309
shares
was
5%.accordingly
he
was
required
to
file
a
schedule
13d
on
may
27,
1971.
he
did
not
do
so
and
that's
not
contested
de
facto
violation.
it
was
not
until
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
mosinee
and
mr.
forester
wrote
to
mr.
rondeau
on
july
30
and
called
to
his
attention
in
the
letter
that
he
might
have
problems.
here,
rondeau
might
have
problems
under
the
securities
act
that
mr.
rondeau
for
the
first
time
consulted
legal
counsel
and
was
advised
that
he
indeed
did
have
problems
under
the
act
and
that
he
should
discontinue
his
purchases
and
accumulate
the
information
to
file
a
schedule
13d
which
the
district
court
found
that
he
promptly
did.
it
was
filed
on
august
25,
1971.
this
action
was
filed
september
2,
1971.
that's
an
important
fact.
it
is
quite
clear
we
submit
that
mr.
rondeau
did
not
file
in
response
to
this
action
nor
was
the
purpose
we
believe
of
this
suit
to
force
mr.
rondeau
to
file
rather
it
was
to
neutralize
him
or
tie
him
up.
in
short
it
was
not
to
enforce
the
act
but
it
was
to
use
the
act
to
the
advantage
of
the
company.
now
that's
indicated
because
the
customary
conduct
in
cases
of
this
nature
is
for
the
company
to
file
a
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
frequently
to
seek
a
tro.
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
here
was
not
filed
with
the
complaint
but
was
filed
some
weeks
later
and
then
was
withdrawn.
in
itself
indicating
that
the
company
was
apparently
not
sustaining
irreparable
injury
which
required
to
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
yes
there
was.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
yes,
in
late
september
mr.
rondeau
filed
an
amended
--
an
amendment
to
his
schedule.
it
does
not
materially
change
the
part
and
information
on
the
schedule
in
the
attempt
to
get
all
of
this
lined
up
in
august.
the
allocation
between
various
purchasers,
various
defendants
was
slightly
misstated.
the
total
number
of
shares
was
not
stated
but
the
allocation
was
slightly
misstated.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
right.
and
the
question
of
financing,
he
--
he
was
--
had
some
difficulty
in
tracing
whether
he
abused
loans
of
various
kinds
for
purchasers
and
that
was
clarified
in
the
subsequent
schedule
and
his
statement
of
purpose
was
amplified
but
i
submit
not
significantly
changed
in
the
amendment
that
was
filed.
the
amendment
was
perhaps
filed
out
of
the
abundance
of
caution.
we
do
not
contend
one
way
or
the
other
whether
it
was
filed
in
response
to
the
lawsuit.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
no.
the
original
schedule
indicated
that
he
--
one
of
his
purposes
might
be
to
tender
for
stock
to
seek
control
and
the
amendment
simply
amplify
that
to
simply
some
additional
language.
at
the
time
of
these
purchasers
--
purchases,
the
chairman
of
mosinee
was
the
man
by
the
name
of
forester,
a
lawyer
who
did
not
practice
but
who
with
his
companies
managed
trust.
mr.
forester,
his
family
and
the
trust
that
he
managed
were
the
largest
shareholders
in
--
as
a
group
of
mosinee.
the
president
was
mr.
sholtons.
they
became
informed
of
mr.
rondeau's
purchases
very
early
and
both
of
them
monitored
his
purchases
by
keeping
tabulations.
mr.
sholtons
called
mr.
rondeau
when
his
purchases
reached
the
level
of
approximately
18,000
shares.
mr.
rondeau
purchases
were
open
and
notorious.
most
of
the
shares
were
purchased
in
his
own
name,
some
34,000.
no
shares
were
purchased
in
street
name.
over
40,000
shares
were
purchased
in
the
--
his
own
name
or
in
the
names
of
companies
bearing
his
name.
there
seems
to
be
no
dispute
that
at
least
by
june
or
july,
it
was
well
known
to
mr.
sholtons
and
mr.
forester
that
rondeau
was
also
associated
with
mosinee
cold
storage
and
wasa
cold
storage.
mr.
forester's
letter
to
rondeau
refers
to
rumors
in
the
mail
and
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
well
known
that
rondeau
was
purchasing
stock.
his
purpose,
he
has
testified
on
deposition
and
there
were
some
23
depositions
taken
in
this
case.
his
purpose
initially
was
a
matter
of
investment
and
continued
to
be
a
matter
of
investment.
as
he
acquired
more
shares,
he
express
some
interest
in
stockholder
representation
on
the
board
but
the
district
court
found
that
he
had
no
control
purpose
and
took
no
active
steps
toward
the
objective
of
control
until
after
he
receive
mr.
forester's
letter,
talk
to
his
attorney
and
was
advised
that
in
the
13d,
he
would
have
to
state
a
purpose.
the
conservative
advice
given
by
attorneys
in
filing
13d
schedules
is
to
state
any
purpose
that
you
have
or
may
have
so
that
the
veracity
of
your
13d
cannot
later
be
challenged
if
you
decide
to
proceed
with
a
tender
offer
or
proxy
statement.
that
was
what
he
did.
but
even
by
the
time
that
this
13d
was
filed,
he
had
taken
no
real
active
steps
toward
a
tender
offer.
he
had
no
financing
line
up.
he
had
not
proceeded
to
a
higher
or
proxy
soliciting
firm
and
etcetera.
the
district
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
issue
that
mr.
rondeau
had
no
serious
intent
to
attain
--
to
attempt
to
obtain
control
prior
to
forester's
letter
that
mr.
rondeau
and
his
associates
did
not
engage
in
intentional
covert
or
conspiratorial
conduct
rather
that
the
violation
was
unintentional
and
we
submit
the
simple
fact
of
the
way
he
purchased
the
shares
and
how
they
were
registered
and
the
fact
that
he
knew
that
they
knew
that
he
was
purchasing,
supports
that.
and
that
mr.
rondeau
scheduled
13d,
met
the
requirements
of
the
act.
the
court
therefore
concluded
that
since
there
was
an
unintentional
mistake,
and
with
the
passage
of
time,
if
being
some
1
year
and
a
half
after
the
violation
had
occurred
that
it
was
appropriate
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
it
is
now
of
course
several
years
after
the
violation.
there
has
been
no
tender
offer.
there
has
been
no
proxy
contest.
annual
meetings
have
been
conducted
in
the
years
1971,
72,
73
and
74
without
contest.
as
i
noted
before
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
was
withdrawn.
the
court
of
appeals
took
quite
a
different
view.
the
court
of
appeals
in
my
view
accepted
the
facts
as
recited
by
mr.
--
by
judge
doyle.
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
since
there
was
a
violation,
there
had
to
be
some
sort
of
a
remedy.
and
ordered
a
permanent
injunction
against
further
violation
and
a
sterilization
of
3%
of
the
stock
by
which
i
mean
he
could
not
exercise
the
ordinary
rights
of
a
shareholder
to
vote
3%
of
his
shares.
the
difference
between
the
5%
and
the
8%
that
he
ultimately
acquire.
the
courts
of
appeals
decision
is
somewhat
ambiguous
on
the
matter
of
harm.
they
do
say
that
mosinee
was
harmed
back
in
1971
because
they
got
the
13d
information
late.
but
there
is
no
indication
of
continuing
harm
or
any
harm
in
1974
and
they
go
on
to
state,
that
in
all
events
no
proof
of
irreparable
harm
is
necessary.
obviously,
this
was
a
matter
that
was
debated
among
the
judges
because
there
is
a
strong
dissent
by
judge
pell
and
a
thorough
discussion
which
i
commend
to
the
court.
there
was
no
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
future
violations
which
would
i
submit
be
necessary
to
support
a
permanent
injunction
and
there
was
no
explanation
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
a
nexus
between
the
violation,
any
harm
that
may
have
resulted
from
the
violation
and
the
relief
that
is
ordered.
in
short,
the
relief
that
is
ordered
really
doesn't
bare
any
relationship
i
submit
to
what
the
court
found
the
violation
to
be
or
the
harm
to
have
existed
back
in
1971
if
there
was.
perhaps
i
should
state
clearly
what
we
are
not
contending.
we
do
not
dispute
that
the
act
was
violative.
we
do
not
dispute
mosinee's
standing
to
bring
this
suit
although
it
cannot
by
this
suit
benefit
its
shareholders
who
bought
or
sold
stock
during
the
period
of
violation.
we
do
not
contend
that
injunctive
or
other
remedies
are
inappropriate
in
all
cases.
in
fact
we
concede
and
contend
that
injunction
and
other
remedies
are
appropriate
in
some
cases.
much
of
the
--
mr.
david
e.beckwith
there
was
a
suit
filed
by
the
valley
trust
company,
i
may
have
the
name
on.
by
counsel
for
the
same
counsel
that
represents
mosinee.
wisconsin
valley
trust
company
happens
to
be
the
stock
registrar
for
mosinee
paper
company
and
mr.
forester
was
the
chairman
of
mosinee
is
also
a
board
member
of
the
trust
company.
that
suit
has
not
been
pursued,
obviously
rondeau
would
contest
their
standing
to
be
a
proper
representative
under
rule
23.
it
is
pleaded
as
a
class
action.
it
simply
has
pended.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
yes
i
--
mr.
david
e.beckwith
mr.
justice,
i
am
not
certain
whether
it
is
sold
to
rondeau
or
sold
stock
period
but
it
is
one
of
those
two.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
well,
i
don't
know
the
trading
history,
i
think
it
was
treated
relatively
actively.
incidentally
mr.
forester
himself
and
his
trust
that
he
managed
purchased
20,000
shares
in
the
days
of
july
30
and
the
few
days
following.
and
of
course,
the
question
would
be
raised
as
to
whether
shareholders
who
sold
to
mr.
forester
who
then
had
inside
information
might
also
have
the
suit.
so
it's
a
tangled
scheme
on
that
side.
but
this
action
i
submit
cannot
adjust
any
rights
between
shareholders
of
the
corporation,
mr.
rondeau
and
any
other
shareholders,
or
former
shareholders.
the
purpose
of
the
williams
act
in
our
view
is
to
provide
really
the
rules
of
contest
for
tender
offers
and
pretender
offers.
it's
a
note
to
statute.
it
filled
the
gap
that
existed
in
the
1934
act.
once
a
proper
schedule
is
filed,
the
act
has
done
its
job
unless
some
sort
of
a
cooling
off
period
maybe
required.
for
that
reason
most
cases
involved
preliminary
injunctions.
the
act
does
not
proscribe
conduct
which
is
malum
in
se.
that
is
to
say
an
uninformed
businessman
possessing
the
highest
sense
of
business
ethics
would
not
necessarily
know
that
if
he
purchase
more
than
5%
of
the
stock
of
a
corporation,
he
was
guilty
of
violating
a
federal
law
and
required
to
file
a
schedule.
now
that
does
not
excuse
the
violation
and
that
is
not
our
position.
but
it
does
--
mr.
david
e.beckwith
excuse
me
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
well
in
our
reply
brief,
we
suggest
that
their
--
that
the
issue
was
not
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
there
was
no
cross
petition
and
that
therefore
it's
not
properly
before
the
court.
but
i
would
say
to
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
even
if
one
were
to
take
that
argument
and
even
if
one
were
to
accept
the
facts
and
i
might
state
in
our
argument,
in
our
arguments
to
judge
doyle
and
in
our
briefs
to
judge
doyle.
we
said
give
mosinee
its
facts
and
give
them
all
the
inferences
that
they
want
from
the
facts.
with
the
passage
of
time
and
with
the
fact
that
an
adequate
13d
has
been
filed,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
that's
right,
i
think
there
is
ample
evidence
and
if
the
court
is
inclined
to
review
the
facts
de
novo
which
i
think
would
be
unwise
but
if
that
were
to
happen,
there
is
ample
evidence
to
support
judge
doyle's
conclusions
and
the
arguments
of
that
or
the
description
of
that
will
be
found
in
our
seventh
circuit
brief
which
is,
i
had
directed
this
file
here
for
your
examination.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
i
appreciate
that
and
that's
been
the
argument
of
mosinee's
counsel.
what
i
really
mean
to
say
and
i
--
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
testimony,
there
is
not
a
substantial
or
significant
material
dispute
as
to
the
operative
facts.
those
areas
which
--
in
which
there
might
be
some
dispute
or
which
you
might
draw
some
inference
differently
are
not
essential,
are
not
operative
so
far
as
the
decision
of
this
case.
congress
made
it
quite
clear
in
the
passage
of
the
act
that
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
to
tip
the
balance
in
--
and
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
that
the
williams
act
could
be
used
as
a
vehicle
by
management
to
neutralize
a
stockholder
who
might
be
kicking
up
the
traces.
it's
our
position
that
the
proper
administration
of
the
williams
act
should
provide
for
flexibility
that
the
remedy
should
be
carefully
tailored
to
cure
any
corporate
harm
flowing
from
the
violation
as
distinguished
from
anxiety
by
management.
for
instance,
a
limited
injunction
for
a
cooling
off
period
might
be
appropriate
in
some
cases.
sterilization
is
not
appropriate,
that
is
a
punitive
remedy.
the
act
should
be
administered
to
avoid
tipping
the
balance
between
the
tender
offer
or/and
management.
the
equal
opportunity
for
the
offer
or/and
management
to
present
their
case
will
be
frustrated,
if
management
can
invoke
a
technical
violation
to
prevent
a
large
stockholder
from
exercising
his
rights
for
a
long
period
of
time.
there
must
be
a
showing
of
continuing
irreparable
harm
to
the
corporation
as
there
was
incidentally
in
the
bath
case
which
is
one
of
the
leading
lower
court
cases
and
is
a
seventh
circuit
court
case.
mosinee
argues
that
such
a
continuing
irreparable
harm
is
not
required.
a
punitive
remedy
is
inappropriate
and
a
punitive
remedy
will
not
deter
unintentional
violations.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
there
is
no
way
that
a
person
uninformed
to
the
act
will
be
deterred
by
a
punitive,
we
submit
punitive
remedy
here
and
i
commend
to
you
reading
the
opinion
of
judge
mansfield
in
the
second
circuit
in
2152
288
f.2d
which
we
have
cited
at
214
on
this
subject.
there
should
be
no
permanent
injunction
in
this
or
any
other
case
i
submit,
absent
a
finding
of
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
future
violations
that
will
cause
harm
to
the
corporation
and
in
that
regard,
the
standard
should
be
higher
in
private
litigation
than
it
is
an
scc
litigation.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
well
there's
ample
incentive
as
this
case
well
illustrates.
litigation
even
in
unintentional
violation
will
--
can
result
in
litigation
and
will
result
in
litigation
which
can
tie
out
a
shareholder
who
has
any
intent
to
tender
or
engage
in
a
proxy
contest.
it
would
be
a
foolish
thing
to
do.
there's
plenty
of
incentive
for
a
shareholder
to
file.
the
only
time
that
there
will
be
--
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
time
when
you
will
find
the
deterrence's
of
factor
is
where
you
have
an
intentional
covert
conspiratorial
violation
by
a
group
who
thinks
that
it
can
obtain
some
strategic
advantage
by
not
filing,
by
keeping
it
to
their
purpose
disclosed
and
by
proceeding
to
accumulate
a
large
block
of
stock.
that
is
the
time
when
you
--
perfectly
properly
a
district
judge
would
enter
an
injunction.
those
are
the
facts
in
bath.
and
in
that
case
an
injunction
was
entered.
but
even
in
that
case,
the
injunction
provided
that
the
parties,
the
defendants
would
be
enjoined
only
until
illegally
sufficient
schedule
13d
was
filed.
respondent
has
argued
that
mosinee
shareholders
were
deprived
of
information
for
a
period
of
time.
our
response
to
that
is
what
information?
what
did
mr.
rondeau
have
to
tell
them
in
may
and
june
that
was
important
to
them?
furthermore,
this
case
will
not
affect
the
rights
between
shareholders.
the
remedy
does
nothing
for
shareholders
who
bought
or
so.
and
i
think
the
harm
to
shareholders
that
is
referred
to
repeatedly
by
mosinee
should
be
put
in
context.
we're
talking
about
16,000
shares
that
were
purchased
after
may
27
out
of
a
total
of
800,000
shares
issued
on
--
and
outstanding.
suppose
that
shareholders
purchase
stock
which
is
one
of
mosinee's
arguments
expecting
the
company
to
be
stable
and
not
knowing
that
there
might
be
a
tender
offer.
those
shareholders
were
not
harmed
as
soon
as
the
schedule
13d
was
filed.
if
they
decided
that
it
was
not
an
appropriate
investment,
they
could
have
sold
and
sold
that
again.
so
no
one
was
materially
injured
by
the
harm
here,
and
certainly
not
the
corporation.
but
even
if
shareholders
were
harmed,
this
action
is
not
directed
to
that
purpose.
this
action
has
to
do
with
corporate
harm
only.
the
cases
that
are
relied
upon
by
the
respondent
principally
involved
preliminary
injunctions
and
we
submit
are
in
all
instances
distinguishable
on
their
facts
particularly
such
cases
as
chris
craft
and
butler
aviation.
two
lower
court
decisions
support
judge
doyle,
2523
both
of
which
are
cited
by
us.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
yes.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
yes.
it
was
an
affirmance
by
the
eighth
circuit
and
of
a
district
court
decision.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
i
don't
think
so
and
it
was
cited
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
was
cited
in
our
brief.
it
was
referred
too
by
judge
pell
pointing
out
a
split
on
the
circuits.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
oh,
i
think
that's
correct.
yes.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
precedent
in
such
but
if
i
were
--
judge
in
the
eighth
circuit,
i
suppose
i'd
be
mindful
of
that
case.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
well
it's
not
clear
but
presumably
it
does.
by
footnote,
was
find
and
tries
to
massage
that
relief
a
bit
to
suggest
something
else
that
might
be
done.
but
it
simply
says
that
3%
of
the
stock
that
mr.
rondeau
purchased
shall
be
sterilized
for
a
period
of
five
years.
it
isn't
clear
when
the
five
year
starts.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
could
well
be.
and
certainly
if
the
purchaser
could
in
any
respect
be
tied
to
mr.
rondeau,
then
i'm
sure
even
respondent
would
argue
that
the
sterilization
would
cover
but
it's
not
clear
as
to
the
scope
of
it.
i
believe
i
have
some
time
remaining
which
i
would
like
to
reserve.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
just
a
few
points
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
powell,
i
have
empurple
of
your
question
to
my
colleague
mr.
hammond.
section
13d
is
not
designed
to
promote
management
stability
which
is
phrase
used
repeatedly
in
argument
and
in
the
briefs.
in
fact
there
is
no
public
policy
that
says
a
stable
management
is
necessarily
a
good
management
or
beneficial
management.
and
indeed,
it
maybe
to
the
advantage
of
shareholders
to
permit
a
large
influential
stockholder
like
mr.
rondeau
to
exercise
his
rights
and
see
that
the
corporation
is
better
managed.
so
far
as
the
--
mr.
david
e.beckwith
that's
correct.
mr.
david
e.beckwith
his
lurking
presence,
effective
lurking
presence
maybe
helpful.
now
so
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
on
the
factual
matter,
i
call
your
attention
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
which
is
reported
on
page
169
of
the
appendix
where
they
say
having
considered
all
circumstances
concerning
mr.
rondeau's
violation
of
13d
giving
a
fact
to
specially
to
the
district
court's
findings
in
mr.
rondeau
and
the
other
defendants
did
not
engage
an
intentional
covert
and
conspiratorial
conduct
in
failing
to
timely
file
with
13d
and
was
on
a
company
by
tender
offer
or
proxy
solicitation,
we
instruct
this
district
court
so
far.
had
the
circuit
court
considered
other
facts
it
seems
to
me
they
would
have
had
to
remand
for
trial.
four
judges
have
considered
these
factual
arguments
and
have
rejected
and
there
is
no
indication
that
the
seventh
circuit
accepted.
four
years
have
gone
by
since
this
technical
--
i
submit
technical
violation
occurred
in
the
spring
and
summer
of
1971,
if
management
has
been
destructed
four
years,
it's
by
virtue
of
its
own
conduct,
not
by
virtue
of
mr.
rondeau.
so
far
as
the
arguments
that
classes
have
been
damaged
in
whatever
manner
whether
it's
out
of
the
blue
or
in
any
other
way,
i
submit
those
arguments
are
directed
primarily
to
the
question
of
violation
or
standing
and
not
remedy.
the
issue
here
is
remedy
not
whether
management
can
sue
or
should
sue
or
whether
somebody
might
be
injured
or
will
be
injured.
the
question
is
what
do
we
do
now
four
years
later.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeal
decision
i
submit
will
lead
to
abuse
in
our
circuit.
it
will
turn
this
act
that
was
designed
to
provide
fair
rules
of
conduct
in
tender
offer
situations
into
a
weapon
that
can
be
used
by
management
to
neutralize
a
shareholder
that
may
effectively
control
--
may
effectively
gain
control
or
affect
the
management
of
a
corporation
and
that's
good,
that's
not
bad.
so
far
as
the
benefit
to
mr.
rondeau
and
not
filing,
it
was
well
known
that
he
was
purchasing
stock.
mr.
forester
wrote
to
the
directors
on
may
7,
that's
just
about
30
days
after
mr.
rondeau
made
his
first
purchase
calling
their
attention
to
the
fact
that
mr.
rondeau
was
purchasing
stock
and
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
mr.
forester
and
mr.
sholtons
started
tabulating
his
purchases
virtually
from
the
first
day
that
they
appeared
on
the
registrar
of
the
corporation
and
that
was
in
about
april
26.
the
market
price
of
the
stock
as
suggested,
he
might
have
benefited
because
he
was
buying
in
a
stable
market
even
after
he
filed
this
13d,
there
was
a
day
or
two
when
the
market
blipped
up,
there's
no
indication
there
was
any
trading
at
the
higher
level
because
its
over
the
counter
but
then
it's
settled
back
at
the
same
level,
so
but
for
this
lawsuit,
mr.
rondeau
could
have
continued
purchasing
after
the
13d
at
approximately
the
same
level.
in
conclusion
your
honors,
i
submit
that
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
consider
the
remedy
aspect
here
and
to
put
section
13d
and
the
williams
act
back
in
the
proper
context
in
the
seventh
circuit.
thank
you.
