so
that
judges
doyle's
statement
of
facts
is
basically
as
not
findings
of
fact
but
statements
of
fact
that
were
undisputed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
beckwith.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
judge
pell's
dissent
indicates
that
an
appeal
to
the
seventh
circuit.
the
plaintiffs
question
the
propriety
of
granting
summary
judgment
suggesting
that
your
client
was
not
quite
the
innocent
victim
that
he
suggested
he
was.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
majority
apparently
was
willing
to
take
judge
doyle
at
his
word
that
these
facts
were
undisputed
but
are
they
not
in
a
position
to
raise
here
if
they
raise
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
question
is
to
whether
judge
doyle
should
have
resolved
these
questions
without
a
factual
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whatever
mr.
rondeau's
motive
might
have
been
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
talk
about
ample
evidence
to
support
a
judge's
conclusions,
it
sounds
like
you're
talking
about
something
which
is
occurred
after
a
trial
and
findings
of
fact.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
where
did
the
seventh
circuit
get
its
findings
from
if
it
didn't
adopt
judge
doyle's?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
in
effect,
it
resolved
all
doubts
in
favor
of
mr.
rondeau
and
still
said
an
injunction
was
warranted.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
if
we
were
going
to
speculate
about
the
facts
here,
one
speculation
would
be
that
if
he
knew
about
this
law,
he
certainly
would
have
complied
with
it
because
he
had
absolutely
nothing
to
gain
from
not
complying.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
it
was
the
management
that
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
it
might
be
in
legal
trouble.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
judge
doyle
may
have
taken
into
consideration
the
fact
that
mr.
rondeau
lived
in
mosinee
and
that
mosinee
paper
corporation
has
its
headquarters
in
mosinee
and
that
mosinee
is
at
time
of
about
2,500
and
deciding
whether
to
issue
an
injunction?
