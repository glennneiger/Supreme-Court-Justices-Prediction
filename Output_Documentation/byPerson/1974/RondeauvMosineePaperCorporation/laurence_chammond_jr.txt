mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
mr.
hammond
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
initially
i
would
like
to
comment
on
mr.
beckwith's
statement
to
justice
rehnquist
regarding
the
status
of
the
findings
of
fact.
it
is
our
position
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
not
adopt
the
findings
of
fact
of
judge
doyle.
and
i
do
not
think
that
one
can
discern
from
the
opinion
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
that
is
in
fact
the
situation.
judge
pell
in
the
dissent
takes
that
position
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
essential
to
the
court's
determination
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
did
adopt
all
the
findings
of
judge
doyle.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
got
its
findings,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
from
giving
do
deference
to
most
of
the
claims
of
innocence
of
mr.
rondeau
and
the
facts
that
were
before
it
on
the
record
that
came
up.
and
coming
to
the
conclusion
that
whether
you
give
that
do
deference
or
not,
the
nature
of
the
violation
by
mr.
rondeau
was
such
as
would
warrant
relief.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
that's
what
i
believe
they
did.
and
i
would
like
to
get
in
to
just
what
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
concluded
on
the
facts
in
presenting
my
argument.
as
counsel
says,
there
is
no
question
but
what
violation
did
in
fact
occur.
and
the
issue
apparently
is
whether
the
relief
granted
in
this
instance
by
the
seventh
circuit
is
appropriate
under
the
circumstances
whether
wrong
was
committed.
there
is
no
doubt
in
this
instance
that
the
market
operator
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
without
knowing
that
mr.
rondeau
was
involved
in
substantial
acquisitions
of
shares
to
the
level
that
the
congress
has
said
is
sufficient
to
prompt
the
necessity
for
giving
public
notice.
and
when
one
says
the
notice
must
be
given
to
the
company
to
the
exchanges
upon
which
the
stock
is
traded
and
to
the
sec,
one
has
to
acknowledge
that
this
notice
is
really
a
notice
that
is
flowing
to
the
public.
it
is
the
public
that
is
involved
whether
the
public
be
involved
in
accurately
buying
shares
today
or
conceivably
buying
them
tomorrow
or
selling
shares
today
or
selling
them
tomorrow.
the
failure
to
give
the
notice
operated
to
the
disadvantage
of
those
people
who
sold
their
shares
at
the
time
rondeau
was
buying
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
that's
correct
justice
stewart.
it
operated
to
their
disadvantage,
just
one
class.
it
operated
to
the
disadvantage
of
sellers
who
sold
during
that
time
period
because
if
the
knowledge
had
been
public
that
this
was
going
on
and
that
mr.
rondeau
was
quickly
acquiring
shares,
that
would
have
a
substantial
effect
on
the
market
place.
it
certainly
affected
or
would
have
affected
the
judgment
of
people
who
buy
shares
because
they
look
to
a
company
for
stability,
long
term
accretions
and
capital
and
in
fact
are
abhor
getting
involved
in
companies
that
have
internal
turmoil
or
management
conflicts,
those
people
would
--
could
still
buy
under
these
circumstances
not
knowing
that
there
is
a
potential
conflict
and
i
think
the
court
must
keep
in
mind
that
it's
not
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
or
is
not
an
intention
at
the
time,
to
take
over
control
of
the
company,
that
is
the
real
objective
of
giving
the
notice.
it
is
the
potential
for
the
conflict,
potential
for
change
in
management,
potential
for
corporate
operation
to
continue
potential
for
sufficient
market
interest
to
increase
stock
price.
those
are
the
things
that
13d
is
aimed
to
provide
publicity
for
and
it
is
the
mere
potential
that
that
goes
on
by
virtual
one
acquiring
5%
of
the
stock
of
a
company
that
prompts
the
--
that
become
into
effect
and
the
requisite
for
giving
public
notice.
it
operates
to
the
destruction
of
management
of
a
company
whose
obligation
it
is
to
ceded
information
as
disseminated
to
its
shareholders
and
see
that
their
interest
are
protected.
and
when
the
instance
arises
that
it
suddenly
discovers,
late
although,
excuse
me,
late
--
somewhat
belatedly
someone
is
involved
in
buying
stock,
it
starts
passing
the
information
out.
it
then
must
get
involved
in
litigation
as
counsel
says
because
litigation
is
probably
one
of
the
only
vehicles
by
which
people
can
be
required
to
conform
to
the
law
and
that
is
a
substantial
destruction
from
the
operation
of
a
company.
all
of
these
things
flow
from
violation
of
13d.
now,
some
members
of
this
class
or
one
of
these
classes
are
clearly
identifiable
and
perhaps
the
damages
that
flow
to
them
are
easily
discernable.
you
can
for
instance
take
a
look
at
the
market
and
come
to
some
--
come
to
some
conclusion
as
to
what
the
level
of
damages
as
to
someone
who
sold
it
not
knowing
that
this
was
going
out
or
bought
not
knowing
this
was
going
out.
but
when
you
come
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
someone
who
got
into
the
market
at
later
date
not
knowing
and
the
stock
never
fluctuated
in
price,
what
his
injury
is
or
the
man
who
bought
because
he
was
looking
for
stability
and
then
finds
a
company
that
is
correct
in
turmoil
and
has
all
kinds
of
considerations
as
to
when
you
should
sell
and
whether
or
not
he
should
get
out,
tax
considerations,
other
considerations,
this
people
are
also
injured
and
i
think
that's
one
issue
that
gets
to
the
question
or
these
are
facts
that
get
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
irreparable
injury
is
really
required.
now
i
would
like
to
say
on
that
i
do
not
think
that
irreparable
injury
in
the
classic
sense
is
required
in
order
to
prompt
the
initiation
and
attainment
of
relief
in
this
kind
of
case.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
that's
true
justice
burger
but
by
the
same
token,
congress
has
not
written
in
to
the
act
many
of
the
rights
that
have
been
pursued
under
the
securities
law,
under
section
10
(b)
5,
under
section
16
(b),
under
short
swing
profits,
they
do
not
in
fact
establish
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
don't
think
so
justice
burger.
in
fact
i
think
that
the
court
could
have
gone
much
farther
in
this
case
and
that
in
fact
went.
i
think
the
court
could
have
ordered
that
he
disposed
of
the
stock.
i
think
that
would
probably
be
the
ultimate
penalty
that
they
would
impose
but
i
think
that
they
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
think
if
the
situation
were
aggravated
enough,
all
of
it,
if
he
--
if
the
facts
were
to
disclose,
that
this
was
a
concerted
plan,
a
device
for
requiring
control
of
the
company
and
the
level
of
acquisition
had
achieved
the
level
of
control
for
instance
that
under
those
circumstances,
he
could
be
required
to
dispose
off
all
of
it.
i
think
that
one
must
gradate
the
kind
of
ultimate
result
as
this
commencer
with
the
wrong
doing.
and
this
case
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
struck
a
very
heavy
balance.
getting
back
for
a
few
moments
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
balance
is
really
appropriate,
i
think
that
regardless
of
the
level
of
conspiratorial
intentional
violation
that
counsel
seems
to
think
is
essential
for
any
kind
of
relief,
what
the
seventh
circuit
in
fact
said
was
there
is
this
much
damage
perpetuated,
there's
much
mischief
prompted
by
careless,
abandoned
and
disregarded
the
laws
in
the
securities
field
as
there
can
be
by
a
virtue
of
an
intentional
violation.
and
in
this
case,
i
think
the
facts
clearly
show
without
equivocation
that
mr.
rondeau
acted
in
clear
abandon
of
the
law
and
made
no
effort
whatsoever
to
it
in
accordance
with
the
level
of
requirement
is
imposed
upon
him.
one
has
to
take
a
look
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
well
i'm
not
so
sure
it
is
conceded.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
it's
concededly
violated.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
but
it's
not
conceded
that
he
is
painted
as
an
innocent
mistaken
individual.
not
very
well
skilled
in
the
law
and
not
very
well
acquainted
as
to
what
the
legal
requirements
are.
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
his
business
background,
he
is
an
eligible
businessman,
he's
not
unacquainted
of
the
legal
requirements,
he
is
a
president
of
a
couple
of
corporations,
he
is
the
head
of
a
foundation
which
undoubtedly
was
established
for
rather
sophisticated
tax
reasons.
he
is
a
limited
partner,
a
set-up
limited
partnership
so
he
can
hold
his
property
in
separate
from
his
business
operating
business.
he
is
engaged
in
many
sort
of
sophisticated
activities
including
at
the
backing
industry.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
but
there
is
a
substantial
benefit
to
achieve
by
not
complying.
the
benefit
to
achieve
is
if
you
do
comply
and
you
advise
the
market
that
you
are
acquiring
and
that
you
have
some
information
and
there
is
--
there
maybe
a
tender
offer
or
proxy
3812
that
people
who
sell
their
stock
suddenly
are
not
very
wind
to
sell
it.
at
least
they're
not
going
to
sell
the
prices
they
were
formally
able
to
sell
that.
so
mr.
rondeau
derives
the
benefit
of
the
market
saying
staying
stable
during
that
period
of
time
when
he
does
not
report
it.
in
addition,
mr.
rondeau
achieves
the
benefit
of
surreptitious
involvement
communicating
with
others,
all
of
which
the
management
is
unaware
of.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
and
that's
true
because
the
management's
obligation
is
to
advise
the
public
and
to
see
that
mr.
rondeau
when
they
find
out
that
he
is
engaging
a
violation
advise
the
public
and
it
was
in
this
instance,
the
management
that
advised
him
on
july
30th
when
it
finally
discovered
or
did
not
even
discover,
guessed
based
upon
putting
together
a
lot
of
facts
that
mr.
rondeau
in
fact
was
in
violation
that
they
said
"we
think
we
have
a
securities
problem
here."
not
--
mr.
rondeau
however
did
not
promptly
file,
25
days
later
he
filed
its
first
13d.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
oh,
i
think
that
mr.
sholtons
who
is
the
president
of
mosinee
and
mr.
rondeau
are
good
friends
and
they
are
the
first
name
basis.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
no,
i
don't
even
think
that's
fair
to
say
justice
stewart.
i
think
mr.
sholtons
and
mr.
rondeau
are
still
good
friends
although
probably
there
is
a
4005
involved.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
yes.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
cham
is
the
president
of
the
company.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
yes.
but
when
he
did
file,
the
13d,
i
think
the
court
should
take
notice
of
the
rather
debatable
way
in
which
is
posture
was
put
forward.
i
think
that
the
seventh
circuit
came
to
the
conclusion
that
regardless
of
how
you
view
this
violation,
it
requires
some
sort
of
responsible
response
and
that's
on
that
basis,
the
seventh
circuit
gave
the
response
which
it
did.
i
think
that
it's
essential
when
one
recognizes
in
this
4110
the
manner
in
which
shares
can
be
held
that
it
is
essential
to
give
some
deference
to
the
manner
in
which
securities
violations
are
pursued.
the
sec
certainly
would
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
pursuing
violations.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
about
the
only
time
a
violation
truly
gets
called
to
the
detention
of
the
sec
would
be
when
a
filing
occurs
and
the
filing
is
erroneous.
the
only
other
instance
would
be
if
a
company
became
aware
of
the
violation
and
made
its
call
and
determined
that
the
violation
had
occurred
and
let
the
sec
and
the
sec
would
have
to
pursue
all
of
these
things.
decisions
of
the
court
from
this
country
and
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that
the
companies
are
acting
in
the
capacity
of
private
attorneys
general
in
pursuing
violations
that
occur
in
the
securities
law
and
that
should
not
be
discouraged.
the
private
attorneys
general
are
the
only
ones,
the
companies
who
really
have
the
best
opportunity
to
perceive
when
violation
occurs
because
it
is
on
their
transfer
books
ultimately
that
the
recordation
of
the
violation
takes
place,
perhaps
and
i
say
perhaps
because
in
this
sophisticated
days,
people
very
often
do
not
hold
their
stock
in
their
own
name,
they
hold
them
in
street
names.
and
if
one
holds
them
in
the
street
names,
even
then
it's
very
difficult
to
ascertain
when
a
violation
occurs.
in
this
particular
instance,
mr.
rondeau
did
not
use
street
names
although
he
used
multiple
corporations
and
foundations
for
acquisition
of
stock.
counsel
says
that
he
held
34,000
in
his
own
name
but
34,000
is
less
5%
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
first
communication
that
took
place
between
mr.
sholtons
and
mr.
rondeau,
the
conversation
was
that
he
intended
to
by
up
to
40,000
shares.
very
unusual
figure
for
a
man
to
use
who
has
no
knowledge
of
the
securities
law
when
one
recognizes
it
in
this
case,
5%
is
about
300
shares
over
40,000.
i
submit
that
the
facts
can
paint
mr.
rondeau
in
several
fashions.
and
in
this
particular
instance,
the
seventh
circuit
came
to
the
conclusion
that
even
if
you
accept
the
painting
that's
given
by
mr.
beckwith,
non-intentional
covert
conspiratorial.
but
nevertheless
a
businessman
who
is
reasonably
knowledgeable
to
form
a
law
who
was
about
to
embark
on
a
million
dollar
investment
in
a
corporation
who
did
nothing
to
confer
with
counsel
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
was
--
it
was
necessary
that
he
engage
in
any
kind
of
protective
filings
who
was
aware
that
this
theory
before
that
at
10%
he
had
to
file
but
who
went
ahead
without
regard
and
cause
this
kind
of
consternation
in
the
market
that
under
those
circumstances
that
some
relief
should
be
afforded.
if
you
do
not
grant
relief
under
circumstances
such
as
that,
there
is
no
deterrent
to
one
who
attempts
to
utilize
the
failure
to
file
to
his
advantage
and
this
particular
case
as
i
indicated,
it
did
work
to
mr.
rondeau's
advantage.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
think
judge
doyle
may
have
taken
that
under
consideration
but
if
he
did
i
think
it's
erroneous
because
to
say
that
it
was
generally
known
that
mr.
rondeau
was
buying
shares.here
is
a
misleading
statement
if
you
are
attempting
to
state
that
the
market
was
aware
that
mr.
rondeau
was
engaging
and
purchase
of
the
stock.
the
market
is
not
also,
the
market
is
--
the
stock
is
treated
over
the
counter
and
it's
traded
widely
and
there
are
great
many
people
involved.
and
if
judge
doyle
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
number
of
people
on
the
street
knew
that
mr.
rondeau
was
buying
shares
and
that
was
sufficient
to
read
--
cause
a
non
disclosure
of
violation
of
the
--
that
i
should
think
that
that's
an
over
statement
or
an
erroneous
conclusion
to
draw
from
that
fact.
the
very
essence
of
the
requirement
for
a
disclosure
and
filing
is
to
disseminate
the
information
throughout
the
market
and
the
potential
market
and
that
was
not
achieved
in
this
case.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
they
never
really
monitored
it
as
such.
i
think
that's
an
erroneous
statement.
what
happened
is
sometime
in
june
i
think,
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
based
upon
mr.
rondeau
is
buying
and
the
recordation
on
the
stock
transfer
books
that
he
was
--
he
had
purchased
a
substantial
number
of
shares
and
i
think
it
comes
to
about
15,000
shares.
at
that
point,
they
call
them
to
welcome
him
as
a
substantial
shareholder.
after
that
they
found
out
that
he
continued
to
buy
and
it
--
when
they
became
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
was
continuing
to
buy
and
approaching
a
very
high
level,
then
they
started
watching
and
monitoring.
and
that
was
in
--
i
say
it's
probably
on
late
june
or
july.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
of
the
same
year.
it
was
not
until
july
30th
when
coupled
with
rumors
and
attempting
to
put
together
the
various
corporations
and
foundations
that
they
knew
mr.
rondeau
had
involvement
in
that
the
company
begin
to
suspect
that
he
had
violated
and
gone
beyond
the
40,309
shares.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
and
they
promptly
told
it.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
25
days
later
he
filed.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
the
complaint
is
that
one,
he
should
have
filed
way
back
when
he
first
--
ten
days
after
he
achieved
5%
which
was
may
20
--
may
17.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
for
what
justice
marshall?
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
think
mosinee
continues
to
suffer.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
think
they
continue
to
suffer
at
all
to
the
fact
that
they
are
distracted
from
their
normal
business
by
pursuing
this
violation.
after
all
it's
4
years
later
now
and
they
are
still
involved
in
litigation
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
this
litigation
distracts.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
management
that
has
to
give
time.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
it
has
to
give
time
and
attention
and
make
decisions
as
to
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
process
appeals
but
that's
only
a
small
faction
of
it.
and
in
addition
to
that
i
think
there
are
people,
justice
marshall
who
are
--
who
bought
stock
in
the
company
during
that
time
period
who
may
still
own
the
stock
and
are
looking
for
the
company
to
settle
back
to
its
stability.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
well,
i
think
its
out
of
the
clear
blue
justice
marshall
but
its
out
of
the
clear
blue
with
with
some
degree
of
realism.
i
think
that
when
you
talk
about
the
--
when
one
talks
about
irreparable
harm,
unfortunately
i
think
too
often,
one
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
that
is
such
a
horrendous
harm
occasion
to
individuals
as
to
be
immeasurable
in
dollars
and
unaccountable
and
i
think
that
there's
a
great
area
of
irreparable
harm
that
has
to
do
with
the
sort
of
out
of
the
blue
only
evaluative
by
conjecture.
it
is
occasion
to
people
by
virtue
of
other
people's
wrong
doings
for
which
protection
must
be
afforded
and
which
if
you
brought
in
action.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
did
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
do
think
however
justice
marshall
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
do
think
that
there
are
cases
that
say
that
irreparable
harm
covers
the
spectrum
of
wrongs
or
damages
including
those
which
are
sole
superficial
as
to
be
and
so
defused
as
not
to
be
measurable
but
yet
to
be
wrongs
that
are
occasion
to
people
and
i
think
this
includes
that
kind
of
a
wrong
and
i
think
when
you
enforce
the
securities
law,
it
is
intended
to
protect
the
kinds
of
people.
not
the
sophisticated
investor
but
the
man
on
the
street
who
buys
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
that's
true
but
it
also
says
that
the
wrong
that
he
accomplishes
by
not
filing
during
the
time
period
must
be
said
it
right.
i
think
that
is
natural
and
in
addition
to
that
if
one
is
to
only
consider
that
ones
one
files
that
that
remedies
the
wrong,
there
is
no
incentive
to
filing.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
think
that
--
yes,
i
think
my
client
could
bring
a
claim
from
money
damages.
i
think
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
prove
what
the
damages
are
in
dollars
and
cents.
i
think
under
the
normal
rules
of
evidence,
it
would
be
practically
impossible.
how
do
you
evaluate
the
distraction
of
management
during
the
course
of
processing
these
things?
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
think
we
ask
for
money
damages.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
yes.
i
think
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
prove.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
yes,
it's
just
drop
out
the
case.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
that's
true,
yes,
well
certainly.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
where
it's
easy
to
prove
and
where
the
damages
have
sufficiently
--
have
sufficient
substance
as
to
warrant
to
pursue
at
the
litigation
in
that
fashion.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
yes,
it
is
a
judicial
creation.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
no,
it
flows
from
that
body
of
law
which
says
that
with
there
is
a
prohibitory
statute
or
directory
statute
which
requires
an
act
and
it's
violated
that
the
wrong
that
is
occasion
to
people
prompts
relief
or
wants
relief
and
including
injunctive
relief.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
even
absent
irreparable
injury
but
i
am
not
holding
to
acknowledge
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
irreparable
injury
because
i
think
as
i
explained
to
justice
marshall
that
it
covers
that
difficult
to
prove
diffused
area
of
injury.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
no
i
do
not
think
it
does.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
only
information
that's
provided
is
the
ownership
of
mr.
forester
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
board
and
his
companies
and
i
do
not
recall
offhand
but
it
is
substantially
less
than
controlling
interest.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
well
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
well
in
this
instance,
the
really
talks
about
5%
as
being
a
controlling
interest
whatever
controlling
interest
means
and
the
law
sets
it
a
different
standard,
different
levels.
in
this
particular
instance,
i
think
of
one
controlled
25%,
one
may
well
have
control
of
company.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
if
the
question
i
understand
is,
what
benefit
will
flow
to
those
non-management
shareholders
in
the
event
we
are
successful
in
the
suit.
i
think
the
only
response
to
that
one
can
give
is
that
mr.
rondeau
will
be
precluded
from
utilizing
shares
he
improperly
acquired
and
to
the
extent
that
those
people
are
shareholders
who
are
satisfied
with
the
operation
of
the
company
and
bought
the
stock
for
normal
business
accretions,
earnings
that
they
--
that
the
company
which
they
bought
into
will
held
those
characteristics.
at
least
it
will
not
be
set
by
those
particular
shares
acquired
in
violation
of
being
utilized
to
create
turmoil
in
the
company.
that's
about
the
only
degree
to
which
those
people
will
be
benefited.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
that's
true,
there
maybe
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
there
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
that's
correct,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
may
well
be
one
of
the
class
of
people
who
are
so
defused
as
not
to
be
recognizable
as
being
injured.
there
are
people
in
today's
market
who
buy
shares
solely
for
the
purpose
of
getting
involved
in
corporations
that
have
this
kind
of
conflict
going
on
because
they
see
quick
accretions
in
value
and
those
people
would
not
be
involved
in
this
because
of
the
non-filing
of
mr.
rondeau.
the
entire
thing
is
geared
for
knowledge
but
when
one
talks
about
the
knowledge,
one
must
put
it
in
perspective
and
the
perspective
is
that
it
must
be
related
to
the
shares
that
are
required
in
the
transactions
in
the
market
to
take
place
or
don't
take
place
as
a
consequence
of
the
lack
of
knowledge.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
there
would
be
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court
under
the
seventh
circuit's
decision.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
yes,
and
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
an
in
rem
determination.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
i
think
that
mr.
rondeau
is
free
his
free
to
dispose
of
his
shares
with
out
the
restriction
of
the
voting
rights
on
those
particular
shares
subject
of
course
to
a
restriction
on
the
voting
right
if
he
were
to
engage
in
a
sale
as
a
5825
for
the
--
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
one
of
his
corporations
or
one
of
his
friends
who
would
agree
to
do
it
and
voted
for
him.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
i
would
put
any
restriction
on
his
right
to
transfer
shares.
mr.
laurence
c.hammond,
jr.
well
i
think
that
there
are
some
restrictions
on
his
right
to
sell
it
that
way.
i
think
there
are
securities
regulations
that
would
prohibit
him
from
selling
by
putting
it
on
the
market
one
day.
i
think
you'd
have
to
register
as
an
offering,
secondary
offering.
so
i
think
there
are
controls
in
that
fashion.
i
do
think
that
the
court
should
--
that
the
summary
judgment
issue
is
properly
before
the
court
and
i
think
that
there
is
a
determination
that
anything
which
would
support
that
the
trial
court
or
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
determination
is
probably
before
the
court
and
the
--
sort
of
court
determination
is
the
upsetting
or
the
overruling
of
the
summary
judgment
and
i
think
that
that
should
also
be
considered
by
the
court.
thank
you.
