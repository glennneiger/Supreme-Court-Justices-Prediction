justice
harry
a.
blackmun
for
the
no.
1123,
the
feola
case
is
one
that
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
respondent
feola
and
others
were
convicted
in
a
jury
trial
violating
a
federal
statute
for
having
assaulted
federal
undercover
narcotics
agents
in
the
performance
of
their
official
duties
and
of
violating
still
another
statute
for
conspiring
to
commit
that
offense.
the
trial
court,
it
instructed
the
jury
that
in
order
to
find
any
of
the
defendants
guilty
on
either
the
conspiracy
count
or
the
substantive
count
the
jury
was
not
required
to
conclude
that
the
defendants
were
aware
that
their
victims
were
federal
agents.
the
court
of
appeals
approved
the
instructions
on
the
substantive
charge
but
relying
on
an
old
second
circuit
case
reversed
the
conspiracy
convictions
on
the
ground
that
knowledge
of
the
official
identity
of
the
victim
must
be
proved
in
order
to
convict
of
a
conspiracy.
the
facts
reveal
a
typical
narcotics
rip
off
when
the
federal
officers
closed
in
on
the
respondent
and
his
associates.
they
were
in
civilian
clothes
and
had
been
assumed
by
the
respondent
to
be
buyers
rather
than
federal
agents.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
we
hold
that
knowledge
of
the
identity
of
the
victim
is
not
necessary
for
a
federal
conviction
for
either
the
substantive
charge
or
the
conspiracy
charge.
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
insofar
as
it
concerns
the
conspiracy
is
therefore
reversed.
i'm
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas.
