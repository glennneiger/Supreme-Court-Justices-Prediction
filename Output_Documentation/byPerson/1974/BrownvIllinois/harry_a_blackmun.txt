justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
last
case,
brown
against
illinois
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
the
petitioner
was
arrested
without
probable
cause
and
without
a
warrant
when
two
chicago
plainclothes
detectives
broken
to
his
apartment
and
awaited
his
return.
they
were
investigating
the
murder
a
few
days
earlier
of
a
man
named
corpus.
brown
was
an
acquaintance
of
that
decedent.
brown
was
taken
into
custody
and
removed
to
the
police
station.
and
there
he
was
warned
of
his
rights
under
miranda
versus
arizona
and
despite
this
warning,
he
gave
two
inculpatory
statements,
each
of
which
was
reduced
to
writing.
he
signed
one
but
not
the
other.
his
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
those
statements
was
overruled.
we
thus
have
a
situation
where
it
is
conceded
that
his
arrest
was
unlawful.
but
where
during
the
custody
incident
to
that
arrest
he
was
given
proper
miranda
warnings
and
in
the
face
of
those
warnings,
issued
statements
that
implicated
him
in
the
crime
under
investigation.
the
illinois
courts
held
that
despite
the
unlawfulness
of
the
arrest,
the
statements
were
admissible
because
the
giving
of
the
miranda
warnings
broke
the
causal
connection
between
the
illegal
arrest
and
the
giving
of
the
statements.
and
thus
his
act
in
making
the
statements
was
sufficiently
an
act
of
free
will
to
purge
the
primary
taint
of
the
unlawful
invasion.
this
issue
takes
us
to
the
court's
decision
in
wong
sun
against
the
united
states
decided
here
12
years
ago.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
illinois
courts
were
in
error
when
they
adopted
a
per
se
rule
that
the
giving
of
the
miranda
warnings
in
and
of
themselves
broke
the
causal
chain
so
that
the
later
statement
even
if
it
were
one
induced
by
the
continuing
effects
of
unconstitutional
custody
was
admissible
so
long
as
in
the
traditional
sense
it
was
voluntary
and
not
coerced
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
we
are
here
concerned
however
with
the
fourth
amendment
and
its
guarantee
against
unlawful
searches
and
seizures.
the
interest
and
the
policies
and
the
--
the
fourth
amendment
serves
are
distinct
from
those
served
under
the
fifth
and
thus
even
though
the
statements
were
found
to
be
voluntary
under
the
fifth
amendment,
the
issue
as
to
the
propriety
under
the
fourth
amendment
still
remains.
we
hold
that
the
question
whether
a
confession
is
voluntary
under
the
guidelines
of
wong
sun
must
be
answered
on
the
facts
of
each
case.
the
miranda
warnings
are
an
important
factor
in
resolving
the
issue
but
other
factors
also
must
be
considered.
and
of
the
course
the
burden
of
showing
the
admissibility
of
the
in-custody
statements
of
persons
illegally
arrested
rest
upon
the
prosecution.
we
go
on
to
hold
that
the
state
in
this
case
failed
to
sustain
its
burden
of
showing
that
the
petitioner's
statements
were
admissible
under
wong
sun.
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
statement
concurring
in
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
had
joined
him
in
that
opinion.
