justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
did
he
appeal
from,
the
loitering
conviction
as
well
as
the
other
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
in
this
case
when
that
went
up
to
the
appellate
division?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
did
it
also
decide
the
motion
to
suppress
was
improperly
overruled?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
to
say
the
inquiry
is
to
what
that
purpose
was
is
irrelevant
to
the
issue
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
the
issue
here
is
if
our
tollett
and
are
we
ready
to
suggest
or
not,
the
plea
of
guilty
foreclosed
on
the
search
and
seizure
issue
any
resort
to
federal
habeas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
while
there
never
may
have
been
the
case
and
whatever
the
reason
the
new
york
legislation
want
to
do
it
that
that
if
the
--
one
plead
guilty
wants
to
do
it
he
may
take
the
suppression
issue
on
appeal
with
the
appellate
court,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
am
i
right
that
after
this
case
i
guess
it
was
judge
--
then
judge
bartle,
denial
leave
to
appeal,
was
isn't
it
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
after
that
the
berck
case
cases
was
decided,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
declared
the
loitering
statue
unconstitutional
on
federal
constitutional
grounds,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
by
that
time
he
was
out
of
lucky.
he
couldn't
--
he
had
no
way
getting
corum
nobus
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
has
no
resort
in
taking
advantage
of
berck
at
all,
does
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
anyway
the
loitering
conviction
on
a
different
ground
was
set
aside?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
you
are
saying
mr.
neustater
that
pre-813,
the
only
way
of
state
procedures
you
could
preserve
this
constitutional
fourth
amendment
claim
is
by
going
through
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
you
go
away
as
far
as
you
could
go
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you
can
come
in
to
federal
habeas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
new
york
said
no,
there
is
another
way
you
can
preserve.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can
plea
guilty
and
take
a
prior
appellate
route?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
neustadter
you
haven't
yet
come
at
it,
maybe
i
just
was
interested
that
the
state's
attorney
general
says
that
this
plea
of
guilty
in
the
face
of
that
statute
forecloses
you
ever
getting
to
federal
habeas
corpus.
it
doesn't
foreclose
you
coming
here
on
certiorari.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you
get
in
a
federal
forum,
i
do
not
understand
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
keeps
you
out
of
a
federal
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
on
the
contrary,
he
hasn't
tried
to.
he
just
says
1257
allows
us
to
review
constitutional
decisions
of
highest
state
court?
