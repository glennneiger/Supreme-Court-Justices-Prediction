justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
open
on
that
appeal
so
far
as
the
appellate
division
in
the
court
of
appeals
are
concerned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
does
it
do
if
it
decides
that
the
decision
on
the
suppression
motion
was
erroneous,
does
it
reverse
the
denial
of
the
motion
or
does
it
reverse
the
conviction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
presume
if
we
reverse
that
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
at
least
there
will
thereafter
be
no
trap
for
the
unwary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
take
at
your
point
is
that
mcmann
and
tollett
didn’t
turn
on
anybody
voluntarily
giving
up
a
claim
to
habeas
corpus,
but
rather
on
a
fact
that
after
you
pleaded
guilty
and
admitted
the
substantive
developments
of
the
offense,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
you're
not
entitled
to
raise
afterwards
certain
claims
on
habeas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
new
york
grants
appeals
by
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
if
in
mcmann,
there
had
been
a
pretrial
suppression
motion
that
had
been
denied,
the
present
new
york
statue
not
being
in
existence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
a
guilty
plea?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
my
question
is
prior
to
813-c,
what
if
they
litigated
in
the
trial
court
lost
and
then
pleaded
guilty?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
question
is
would
federal
habeas
has
been
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
but
then
that's
in
direct
contrary
to
mcmann?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
let
me
repeat
my
question
if
i
may.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
813-c,
a
new
york
state
court
defendant
moves
to
suppress
evidence
in
the
superior
--
the
trial
court,
motion
denied,
pleads
guilty,
that's
the
end
of
the
proceedings
in
the
state
court.
does
he
have
access
to
federal
habeas?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
see
mcmann
until
that
then
is
turning
on
a
notion
waiver
within
the
state
system?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
that
entirely
true
as
to
the
pre
813-c
practice
in
new
york,
you
certainly
had
a
motion
to
suppress
in
the
trial
court
before
813-c
was
enacted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
true
as
to
fourth
amendment
claims
too,
there
is
no
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
it
was
813-c
in
existence
at
the
time
that
mcmann
was
decided?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
the
state
promised
him
in
813-c
was
he
has
right
to
take
that
thing
to
whether
the
appellate
term
or
the
court
of
the
appeals,
they
certainly
didn't
promise
and
that
they
would
not
oppose
the
federal
habeas.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mcmann
itself
wasn't
decided
until
may
4,
1970,
so
whatever
the
new
york
legislature
may
have
had
in
mind
in
1970
in
view
of
second
circuit
cases,
it
wouldn’t
be
second
circuit
cases
that
had
been
considered
in
the
light
of
mcmann,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
new
york
legislature
in
the
teeth
of
these
three
second
circuit
cases
nonetheless
chose
to
reaffirm
or
re-enact
it
but
if
they
didn't
know
about
mcmann
at
the
that
time
that
that
isn’t
the
quite
the
same
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
true
but
the
consideration
they
gave
it
in
1970
sounds
to
me
a
little
--
ought
to
be
a
little
bit
different
factually
than
you
intimated
a
moment
ago?
