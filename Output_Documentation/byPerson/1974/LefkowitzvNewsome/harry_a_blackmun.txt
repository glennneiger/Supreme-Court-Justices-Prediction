justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
this
procedure
open
if
the
defendant
made
no
motion
to
suppress?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question?
suppose
he
made
his
motion
to
suppress
and
it
was
denied
but
he
didn't
appeal
in
the
state
system,
is
it
your
position
that
this
is
still
open
on
federal
habeas?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
there's
any
validity
in
your
opponents
argument
about
this
being
a
trap
for
the
unwary?
