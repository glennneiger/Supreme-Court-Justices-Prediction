justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does
form
a
barrier
to
state
review?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
a
created
state
review,
created
by
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
the
state
says
but
he
can't
--
because
of
that
he
can't
use
the
federal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
read
mcmann
as
relying
on
the
fact
that
under
the
state
procedure
there
was
--
this
was
final,
the
guilty
plea?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
true
in
mcmann?
justice
thurgood
marshall
waived
everything
in
the
state
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
not
true
here?
he
didn't
waive
his
attack
on
the
suppression?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
isn't
that
a
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
even
where
the
state
changes
its
whole
procedure
the
state
could
not
by
any
means
create
a
situation
where
you
could
get
a
discord.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
didn't
go
that
far?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
case
do
you
have
for
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
tollett
didn't
have
this
type
of
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
my
point
is
that
did
the
statute
create
a
difference
--
that's
all
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
therefore
say
that
this
conviction
is
not
in
and
of
itself
not
appealable,
it
said
just
the
opposite.
it
said
it
was
appealable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
the
real
reason
for
the
plea
bargaining,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
you
said,
i
thought.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
for
the
statute
itself.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
should
have
asked
mr.
hammer,
how
did
the
attorney
general
get
into
it
as
product,
where,
is
goes
straight?
justice
thurgood
marshall
washington
too
though?
justice
thurgood
marshall
washington,
the
state
of
washington?
