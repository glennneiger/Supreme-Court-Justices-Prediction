chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1627,
lefkowitz
against
newsome.
mr.
hammer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
--
attempted
possession
is
a
--
at
least
its
novel
to
me,
is
that
what
you
just
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
want
to
answer
mr.
justice
brennan
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
--
so
far
as
new
york
is
concerned
and
the
prosecution
problem,
if
fallacy
question
that
this
statute
gives
the
prosecutor
greater
flexibility
to
deal
for
example
with
first
offenders
or
less
offensive
cases
by
this
device
of
attempted
possession?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
you
wouldn't
to
be
likely
to
do
this
with
a
man
that
three
prior
convictions
for
possession
of
heroin
as
much
you
would
a
20-year
old
fellow
who
is
up
on
first
offense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
find
this
that
there
is
a
fallacy
factor
possibly
working
here
to
give
the
prosecutor
this
greater
discretion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
you
have
a
few
minutes
if
you
wish
to
reserve
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
hammer.
mr.
neustadter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
agree
with
mr.
hammer
then
that
the
states
maybe
more
generous
without
suffering
any
penalty
for
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
speak
mr.
neustadter
of
this
being
an
alluring
matter
for
the
defendant
if
the
state
is
--
the
implication
i
got
at
least
was
the
state
is
alluring
in
and
then
springs
the
trap,
i
think
you
used
that
term
but
as
one
of
the
justices
has
pointed
out
that
this
is
a
very
alluring
sort
of
thing
for
him
to
get
off
on
three
months
instead
of
a
year
plus
what
he
might
have
got.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but
in
ordinary
plea
negotiations,
you
do
not
have
the
element
of
this
statute
intervening.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you
see
it
i
suppose
from
that
view
naturally
the
state
sees
it
from
other
views?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
going
back
to
this
alluring
prospect
again,
if
you
prevail,
the
prospect
certainly
will
not
any
longer
be
so
alluring
because
it
will
mean
that
the
state
must
having
made
this
bargain
as
you
put
it,
then
the
defendant
having
had
his
cake
now
can
go
into
the
federal
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
come
up
here.
that's
not
much
of
an
inducement
for
any
state
to
avoid
a
lot
of
litigation,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
neustadter.
you
have
about
six
minutes
left
mr.
hammer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
73-1627,
lefkowitz
against
newsome
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
