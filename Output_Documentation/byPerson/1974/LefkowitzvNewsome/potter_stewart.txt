justice
potter
stewart
you
see
it
quite
recently
--
quite
frequently
in
new
york
and
i
don't
see
anywhere
else
attempted
possession
and
attempted
manslaughter
when
indeed
it
is
conceded
that
there
was
a
killing
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
the
new
york
peculiarity,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
the
policy
ground
underlying
that
or
at
least
one
of
them
is
to
eliminate
a
lot
of
not
guilty
pleas
that
are
unnecessary
and
a
lot
of
trials
that
are
unnecessary?
justice
potter
stewart
the
person's
only
defense
in
other
words
his
basic
only
defense
is
the
fourth
amendment
claim.
that
can
be
put
to
one
side
and
he
can
plead
guilty
to
everything
else,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
view
is
i
know
that
our
agreeing
with
you
in
this
case
wouldn't
subvert
that
policy,
although
it's
arguable
that
it
would,
wouldn't
it
because
it
would
cause
more
arguably
--
it
went
to
cause
more
not
guilty
pleas
in
the
state
system?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
wouldn't.
there's
not
--
not
a
matter
of
evidence
and
you
don't
know
the
answer
and
i
don't
either,
but
i
wouldn't
do
a
guess
and
speculate?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
state
would
save
the
expense
and
trouble
of
a
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
the
law
of
your
circuit
was
clear,
it
wasn’t
open?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
other
states
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
california
has
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
have
the
federal
habeas
corpus
courts
held
with
respect
to
those
state
statues
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that's
mcmann
--
justice
potter
stewart
any
other
litigation?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
any
other
circuit
is
really
what
i'm
asking?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
at
all
the
california
ones?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
813-c
and
then
you
have
an
analog
for
--
to
test
the
voluntariness
of
the
--.
justice
potter
stewart
any
thing
else?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
of
those
reenacted
in
1970?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
light
of
the
second
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
was
added
in
1970?
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
reenacted
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
second
circuit
law.
justice
potter
stewart
in
spite
of
the
second
circuit
law.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
the
point.
so
mcmann
wouldn’t
have
-disturbed
it.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
a
new
york
statute
permits
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
to
plead
guilty
without
forfeiting
his
right
to
appellate
judicial
review
of
certain
constitutional
claims
including
the
claim
that
evidence
supporting
the
criminal
charge
was
obtained
by
the
state
in
a
search
procedure
that
violated
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
respondent,
leon
newsome,
pleaded
guilty
in
a
new
york
court
to
a
drug
offense
and
then
appealed
under
that
statute
to
the
new
york
appellate
courts
which
ultimately
rejected
his
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
claim
and
affirmed
his
conviction.
newsome
then
applied
to
a
federal
district
court
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
that
court
granted
him
relief.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
judgment
granting
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
at
the
behest
of
the
petitioner,
louis
lefkowitz
who
is
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york,
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
his
claim
that
federal
habeas
corpus
relief
is
not
available
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
because
of
the
plea
of
guilty.
for
the
reasons
set
out
on
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
when
a
state
law
permits
a
defendant
to
plead
guilty
without
forfeiting
his
right
to
judicial
review
of
specified
constitutional
issues,
the
defendant
is
not
foreclosed
from
pursuing
those
constitutional
claims
in
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding
after
he
has
exhausted
his
state
remedies.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
mr.
justice
powell
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
also
joined.
