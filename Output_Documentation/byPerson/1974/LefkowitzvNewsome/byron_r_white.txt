appellate
term,
the
decision
turned
on
the
issue
of
constitutionality
of
the
loitering
statute,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
you're
saying
that
the
state's
position
is
that
sustaining
the
position
you
urge
today
would
not
subvert
the
legislative
aims
in
new
york
in
providing
this
appeal
of
suppression
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
whose
views
are
we
suppose
to
take
this
as
to
the
legislative
purpose
or
expectations,
yours
or
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit?
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
as
i
understand
it
believes
that
to
stuff
out
federal
habeas
in
these
situations
without
would
subvert
the
legislative
aim
of
the
statue?
wouldn't
it,
is
it
not
his
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
frequently
happens
at
federal
that
you
--
that
federal
court
has
to
decide
what
it
believes
the
statute
means
and
it
isn't
necessarily
bound
by
the
views
of
the
attorney
general
of
new
york?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
us?
don't
we
--
what
you're
really
asking
is
to
review
here
is
a
--
in
a
part
of
it
any
way
is
a
--
what
does
the
state
statute
mean
or
what's
behind
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
this,
suppose
there
is
an
appeal
for
the
suppression,
motion
that
has
been
denied
and
only
appeal
then
[voice
overlap]
in
the
state
as
the
new
york
law
permits,
and
it's
decided
one
way
or
another
in
the
supreme
--
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york,
let's
assume
that,
does
petition
for
cert
lie
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
the
denial
of
the
suppression
issue
is
affirmed
and
the
--
and
you
think
the
defendant
at
that
point
get
the
petition
for
cert
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
would
take
jurisdiction
to
that
case
although
we
would
say
a
district
court
would
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
if
the
congress
did
not
pass
the
statute,
and
said
that
federal
habeas
will
not
be
available
in
circumstances
which
is
described
that
would
fit
the
new
york
statute,
there's
no
question
that
then
federal
habeas
wouldn't
be
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you're
--
what
you
really
are
saying
that
in
this
particular
case,
this
person
didn't
think
he
was
waiving
his
federal
habeas
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
habeas
corpus
still
turns
on
whether
there
has
been
denial
of
some
federal
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
have
been
some
denial
state
rights
but
their
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
mcmann
didn't
say
the
result
would
be
different
under
the
new
york
procedures?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
was
clear
in
those
cases
if
they
ever
were
advised
that
they
would
be
giving
up
habeas
as
well
as
the
state
remedies?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
should
suggest
as
they
did,
maybe
they
are
now
quite
the
opposite?
justice
byron
r.
white
another
topic,
you
want
to
go
and
waiver?
the
defendant
in
this
case,
what
expectations
had
he
ever
had
in
getting
into
federal
habeas
corpus?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
he
had
one.
give
me
some
federal
basis
for
his
expectations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
at
the
time
he
pleaded
mcmann
was
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
read
the
case,
so
the
question
was
open?
he
had
no
legitimate
expectations
about
out
this
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's
never
been
anything
else
indicated
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
isn't
that
so,
well
you
disagreed
said
that
mcmann
said
the
question
was
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
the
legitimate
expectation
did
he
have
about
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
that
the
state
wasn't
but
how
about
ultimate
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
not
a
state
law
question,
that's
a
federal
law
question
and
if
you
met
mcmann,
you
would
know
the
question
is
open?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
suggesting
that
it
doesnâ€™t?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
within
the
state
system
but
it
certainly
doesn't
determine
what
federal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
concede
that
if
mcmann
footnote
had
said
in
further
more
even
in
new
york
the
plea
of
guilty
waives
any
resort
here,
you
wouldn't
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
mcmann
didn't
say
that,
it
said
it's
open?
