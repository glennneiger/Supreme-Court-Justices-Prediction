mr.
robert
s.
hammer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
the
exact
same
issue
which
the
court
reserved
to
itself
from
the
case
of
mcmann
against
richardson
in
397
u.s.
at
footnote
13
of
its
opinion.
and
that
question
is
whether
the
federal
habeas
corpus
remedy
is
available
to
a
defendant
who
pleads
guilty,
whether
it
is
permitted
under
state
law
to
appeal
the
denial
of
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
evidence.
in
february
of
1970,
mr.
newsome
was
arrested
for
loitering.
loitering
is
a
violation
carrying
a
maximum
15
days
imprisonment
sentence.
incidental
to
this
loitering
arrest,
mr.
newsome
was
searched
and
it
appeared
that
on
his
person
were
concealed
narcotics
and
narcotic
implements
so
that
he
was
also
charged
with
the
crime
of
possession
of
a
dangerous
drug.
this
was
a
class
a
misdemeanor,
carrying
a
maximum
one
year
imprisonment.
a
trial
on
the
loitering
charge
was
combined
with
a
pre-trial
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence.
the
defendant
contended
that
the
loitering
arrest
which
predicated
the
incidental
search
was
invalid
and
that
the
loitering
statute
was
unconstitutionally
vague.
the
lower
criminal
court
denied
this
motion
and
convicted
him
of
loitering.
at
that
point,
in
may
of
1970,
the
defendant
pleaded
guilty
to
a
reduced
charged
of
attempted
possession
of
a
dangerous
drug
and
he
was
sentenced
to
three
months
imprisonment,
which
was
the
maximum
on
the
so-called
class
b
misdemeanor.
at
that
point
under
what
was
then
section
813-c
of
the
new
york
code
of
criminal
procedure,
he
appealed,
he
was
enlarged
on
bail
and
has
remained
free
ever
since.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
he
appealed
from
both
the
loitering
conviction
and
the
conviction
of
attempted
possession
of
a
dangerous
drug.
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
it's
a
perhaps
a
theoretical
offense.
i
should
point
out
your
honor
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
has
allowed
this
as
a
plea
bargaining
device
in
a
case
of
so
called
attempted
manslaughter
so
that
while
there
are
certain
theoretical
problems
with
such
a
charge
for
purposes
of
pleading
to
a
reduced
charge,
the
new
york
court's
uphold
such
an
arrangement.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well
this
is
--
as
i
pointed
out
as
vehicle
for
allowing
the
plea
to
a
reduced
charge.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
should
point
out
your
honor,
that
there
are
analogous
provisions
of
the
now
criminal
procedural
law
to
permit
the
review
of
convictions
where
there
has
been
a
pretrial
motion
to
suppress
a
confession
or
to
invalidate
an
identification
under
the
wade
rules.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
appellate
court
may
review
the
denial
of
the
suppression
motion
notwithstanding
the
plea
of
guilty.
this
is
the
only
issue
before
the
court
on
such
an
appeal.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
it
--
the
appellate
court
reverses
the
conviction,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
statute
requires
that
a
motion
to
suppress
be
made
otherwise
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
and
overruled
otherwise,
there
is
no
right
to
take
an
appeal
and
the
matter
is
waived
even
at
a
trial
should
the
defendant
plead
not
guilty.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
to
the
appellete
term,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
appellate
term
never
reached
that
issue.
what
--
it
decided
the
loitering
conviction
was
bad
on
non-constitutional
grounds
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
convict
and
that
the
information
itself
charging
the
offense
was
defective.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
no,
your
honor.
it
held
that
the
arrest
was
made
on
probable
cause
so
that
the
incidental
search
was
upheld
and
for
this
reason,
the
conviction
was
affirmed.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
at
that
point
a
certificate
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
sought
and
denied
and
this
court
itself
in
february
1972,
denied
a
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
if
the
defendant
had
then
gone
on
to
trial
and
was
convicted
after
a
trial,
we
would
have
a
totally
different
situation.
our
contention
is
that
it's
the
plea
of
guilty
which
forms
the
barrier
to
federal
collateral
review.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
no,
your
honor.
it's
our
contention
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
exactly
and
of
course
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well
your
honor,
under
lego
against
twomey
the
states
are
always
free
to
be
more
generous
than
--
more
generous
than
the
federal
constitution
requires
and
this
we
suggest
is
what
happened.
the
state
legislature
enacted
a
statute
designed
exclusively
for
the
internal
management
of
the
state
criminal
law
procedure.
they
have
permitted
an
appeal
under
the
circumstance
of
this
case
but
we
insist
with
all
respect
your
honor
that
such
a
statute
cannot
under
any
circumstances
enlarge
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
district
court,
only
congress
can.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
no,
your
honor.
i
suggest
that
their
point
is
not
well
taken.
at
the
outset
it
should
be
emphasized
that
the
state
attorney
general's
office
at
least
has
never
conceded
the
issue
that
section
813
appeal,
automatically
gives
defendant
a
right
if
he's
unsuccessful
to
go
into
the
federal
district
court.
we
have
resisted
it
in
rogers,
we
petitioned
for
certiorari
before
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
we
have
insisted
that
all
813-c
does
is
promise
a
state
appeal
and
of
course
the
state
delivered
on
that
promise.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
absolutely.
i
should
add
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
what
is
involved
here
is
no
different
than
when
good,
competent
counsel
may
miscalculate
upon
the
effect
of
--
or
mis-predict
what
a
higher
court
will
do.
from
the
outset
as
i
mentioned
before,
our
office
has
always
insisted
that
the
federal
habeas
corpus
remedy
may
not
be
maintained
where
a
defendant
enters
a
provident
voluntary
plea
of
guilty
and
this
is
precisely
what
we
have
here.
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
plea
was
voluntary
and
i
submit
that
it
was
quite
provident
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
defendant
when
charged
with
an
offense
carrying
a
possible
one-year
sentence
was
able
to
bargain
it
down
to
three
months.
so
regardless
of
the
legal
point
raised
on
the
motion
to
suppress,
we
have
here
a
plea
of
guilty
which
stands
independently.
the
district
court
originally
dismissed
the
federal
proceeding,
the
case
was
remanded
to
it
under
the
authority
of
this
court's
decision
in
hensley.
as
we
pointed
out,
the
district
court
granted
the
writ
on
the
theory
that
the
loitering
statute
was
unconstitutionally
vague,
citing
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision
in
people
against
berk.
they
did
not
--
the
district
court
did
not
discuss
our
defense
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
because
of
the
guilty
plea.
in
january
of
this
year,
we
argued
the
matter
before
the
second
circuit
and
that
court
was
urged
to
reconsider
its
line
of
cases
in
rogers
on
the
authority
of
mcmann
and
tollett.
we
pointed
out
to
the
second
circuit
that
in
the
case
of
man
against
smith
decided
few
months
previously
by
the
ninth
circuit,
that
court
had
conformed
its
decision
to
the
tollett
ruling
and
we
urge
that
rogers
had
been
overruled
in
essence
by
tollett.
however,
that
court
in
our
view
erroneously
adhered
to
its
own
rule
and
permitted
the
habeas
corpus
remedy
to
be
maintained.
we
submit,
your
honors,
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
mcmann,
in
tollett
and
more
recently
in
blackledge
against
perry,
have
set
forth
a
firm
rule
that
a
conviction
based
upon
a
voluntary
provident
plea
of
guilty
is
immune
from
federal
collateral
attack
on
all
federal
constitutional
claims
except
those
relating
to
the
right
of
the
state
to
bring
the
defendant
to
trial.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
we
submit
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
as
i
understand
the
mcmann
plea
your
honor,
mcmann's
plea
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
in
mcmann,
of
course
the
court
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
of
course
in
mcmann,
the
court
reserved
the
precise
question
that
we
have
at
bar
today.
nevertheless,
towards
the
end
of
the
opinion,
the
court
set
forth
and
i
would
submit
fairly
sweeping
in
absolute
terms
that
the
plea
of
guilty
is
final
whether
there
be
a
right
to
appeal
a
suppression
motion
or
not.
if
there
are
any
doubt,
i
submit
it's
been
resolved
tollett
and
by
blackledge.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well,
of
course,
your
honor
that
the
states
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
but
the
state's
procedure,
i
would
submit
is
not
relevant.
this
is
not
a
waiver
case.
the
defendant
didn't
waive,
we
don't
say
that
the
defendant
waived
his
right
to
federal
habeas
corpus
in
a
sense
of
he
knowingly
gave
it
up.
he
never
had
a
right
to
federal
habeas
corpus
once
he
pleaded
guilty.
we're
not
speaking
of
knowing
waiver.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
well,
we
have
tollett.
this
is
--
tollett
points
out
that
there
is
the
break
in
the
chain
of
events.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that
maybe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
all
the
statute
created
your
honor
was
a
right
to
a
state
appeal.
it
did
not
in
our
submission
extend
and
could
not
possibly
extend
a
federal
remedy.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct
your
honor,
not
withstanding
the
plea
of
guilty
appealable
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
this
is
precisely
our
contention,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
precisely,
the
state
legislature
never
considered
the
problem
and
indeed
they
could
not
by
its
own
legislative
action,
possibly
effective.
this
is
the
problems
of
congress
and
this
court
in
interpreting
the
mandates
of
congress.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
absolutely,
the
legislative
aims
of
new
york
are
merely
to
grant
a
state
appeal.
no
more,
no
less.
this
is
precisely
what
the
state
gives.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
suggest
your
honor
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
would
be
the
case.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
think
your
honor
if
we
have
to
speculate,
the
answer
has
to
be
in
the
negative.
i
don't
think
that
most
defendants
speculate
about
the
possibility
of
a
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings
several
years
hence.
i
think
it
can
be
shown
statistically
although
i
don't
have
the
studies
at
my
finger
tips
that
there
are
more,
much
more
state
defendants
who
appeal
through
the
state
system
whether
they
plead
guilty
of
not
guilty
than
those
seeking
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
precisely.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
in
this
instance
i
know
it
can
be
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
it
can
be
demonstrated
that
it
was
provident,
the
plea
was
provident
because
the
man
reduced
his
exposure
to
imprisonment
from
one
year
to
three
months.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
precisely.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that
is
the
essentially
the
gist
of
the
opinion
below
i
would
submit
however
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
no
your
honor
we
don't
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
the
legislative
intent
of
course
we
contend
will
not
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
since
the
legislature
couldn’t
do
it,
but
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
the
whole
purpose
of
these
statues
was
to
provide
a
statutory
remedy
to
enforce
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
cases
such
as
jackson
against
denno
with
respect
to
confessions,
mapp
against
ohio
with
respect
to
suppression
of
physical
evidence
and
the
way
gilbert
and
stovall
with
respect
to
identifications.
no
--
under
the
circumstances,
the
legislature
had
no
concern
with
either
extending
or
conscripting
the
federal
habeas
corpus
remedy.
it
was
none
of
their
business
just
with
all
respect
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
absolutely
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
precisely.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
answered
him
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
think
in
practical
terms
this
is
the
net
effect.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
should
think
not
your
honor,
but
then
this
would
be
in
the
particular
discretion
of
the
individual
district
attorney,
there
might
be
other
mitigating
factors.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
such
a
view
i
think
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
statue.
we
submit
your
honors,
that
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
no,
your
honor.
corum
nobus
would
not
be
available
because
although
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
should
think
so,
because
we
are
dealing
had
even
convicted
of
loitering,
the
state
court
of
appeals
decision
in
people
against
tenenbaum
would
have
required
a
retroactive
application
of
the
substantive
law.
however,
in
this
instance
we
are
dealing
not
with
substantive
law
but
with
an
issue
of
suppression
of
evidence
and
the
effect
of
--
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
of
course
it's
under
section
1257.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
of
course,
because
of
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
review
the
decisions
of
the
highest
state
court
in
which
the
issue
could
be
heard.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
that's
correct
because
the
statute
gives
this
court
the
right
to
hear
the
case
whereas
it
is
our
submission
that
the
statue
denies
the
district
court
the
right
to
hear
it
on
collateral
attack,
simply
because
the
plea
of
guilty
eliminates
any
case
or
controversy
within
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court.
i
don't
know
if
i
have
any
time
remaining
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
with
the
permission
of
the
court
i
should.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
s.
hammer
i
would
submit
your
honor
that
the
while
the
statute
thus
confer
reciprocal
benefits
upon
both
the
people
and
the
defendant,
however,
the
considerations
underlying
the
enactment
of
such
a
statute
are
in
view
completely
immaterial
to
the
legal
question
at
bar
and
that
is
what
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court?
and
it’s
our
contention
that
the
state
legislature
regardless
of
the
considerations
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
establishing
or
amending
or
creating
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
it
can’t.
only
congress
and
with
this
court
interpreting
the
statutes
of
congress
can
affect
the
district
court's
jurisdiction.
i
would
like
to
re-emphasize
that
waiver
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
plea
of
guilty
forms
the
independent
basis
for
the
conviction.
in
fact
mcmann
itself
is
not
a
waiver
case
since
it
dealt
with
the
substantive
law
on
when
a
guilty
plea
may
be
impeached.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
boykin
doesn't
--
has
nothing
to
say
about
that
a
guilty
plea
will
be
overturned
if
the
defendant
isn't
advised
that
he
has
or
has
not
the
right
to
go
into
the
district
court
for
federal
habeas
corpus
ultimately.
in
the
case
of
man
against
smith,
although
the
procedure
in
california
is
slightly
different
than
that
in
new
york,
the
operative
fact
here
is
the
guilty
plea.
the
--
the
respondent's
attorney
made
much
of
the
fact
that
the
alleged
anomaly
in
this
court's
--
this
court's
certiorari
jurisdiction
direct
from
the
state
courts
and
our
contention
that
the
district
court
lacks
jurisdiction.
the
statutes
are
clear.
2254
(d)
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
a
federal
right
under
22-41
(c)
3.
of
course
since
this
court
on
certiorari
considers
only
cases
of
national
significance,
the
overall
intrusive
effect
onto
state
criminal
law
process
will
be
much
less
than
if
there
is
original
jurisdiction
in
the
district
courts.
counsel
spoke
of
springing
the
trap
because
we
never
talked
about
the
second
circuit's
ruling
in
rogers
in
the
state
courts,
simple
answer
is
we
had
no
occasion
to
that
was
not
known
at
the
time
and
couldn't
possibly
be
known
what
the
defendants
intentions
were
in
the
event
his
state
appeals
went
against
him.
as
for
the
expectations
of
the
state,
the
expectation
is
very
simple,
to
give
the
defendant
a
state
appeal.
all
that
--
that's
all
the
state
intended,
that's
all
the
defendant
could
possibly
expect,
could
reasonably
expect
in
the
light
of
the
state
statute
and
of
course
the
reenactment
of
these
statute
in
the
light
of
the
alleged
light
of
the
second
circuit
rulings,
we
would
regard
as
being
not
material.
it's
our
view
your
honors
that
the
logic
of
the
mcmann
case,
of
tollet,
of
blackledge
requires
a
reversal
in
this
action
and
we
respectfully
so
submit.
thank
you
your
honors.
