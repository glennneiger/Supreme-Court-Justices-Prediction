mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
i
would
like
to
try
and
answer
a
question
or
two
possibly
that
has
been
proposed
here
before
to
some
others
on
both
sides.
i
live
rather
close
to
this
reservation
being
20
miles
away
from
it.
as
far
as
this
map
here
contained
--
in
this
area,
that
is
correct.
i
don't
live
on
the
reservation
now,
but
i
live
about
20
miles
away.
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
yes,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
part
or
any
confusion
even
by
the
state
that
there
is
a
reservation
on
part
of
this
land.
i
believe
it
is
--what
can
we
say
that
they
are
admitting,
they
are
conceding
that
all
of
the
red
area
is
reservation.
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
it
is
indian
country,
it
is--
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
but,
that
the
federal
law
does
apply,
that
the
law
for
the
tribe
applies
on
minor
crimes,
and
let's
come
back
to
1151
that
we
adhere
on
that
thing.
we
think
that
1151
a
is
what
applies,
they
are
saying
it
is
1151
c,
and
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
here
at
this
time,
it's
under
the
major
crimes
act
that
we
are
primarily
thinking
of.
most
of
these
ten
defendants
that
i
was
on
here,
on
the
thing
and
i
will
grant
you,
i
was
the
one
that
filed
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
court
in
this,
after
we
had
gone
through
the
post-conviction
hearing
in
the
state
court
with
more
defendants
but
they
were
no
longer
under
sentence,
so
we
didn't
proceed
with
them.
but,
most
of
them
were
for
the
major
crimes
act.
i
don't
know
which
of
you
justices
asked,
but
that
was
asked.
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
that
is
true
your
honor.
they
feel
that
they
get
a
very
much
better
and
very
much
fairer.
they
resent
state
jurisdiction,
they
think
that
for
the
past
number
of
years
that
they
haven't
had
just
as
under
state
jurisdiction.
out
in
our
country,
there
is
a
saying
that
a
good
indian
is
a
dead
indian,
and
that
hurts
very-very
much
most
of
these
indians.
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
no,
and
i
am
not
trying
to
allege
that
the
state
did
proceed
unfairly.
i
think
that
in
a
lot
of
instances
judge
that
when
these
fellows
get
behind
bars,
they
begin
to
think
these
things.
i
am
not
trying
to
allege
that
they
did,
but
because
of
the
sentiment
involved
and
because
it
is
white
men
applying
that,
they
very
much
resented.
well,
they
don't
resent
the
federal
law.
now,
there
was
one
other
individual
what
i
did
represent
after
this
group
here
that
was
not
involved
in
this
group
who
happened
to
be
a
white
man,
who
had
killed
an
indian.
and
he
wanted
to
be
sentenced
under
the
major
crimes
act,
and
under
his
request,
we
did
go
in
and
get
him
sentenced
under
the
major
crimes
act,
which
was
his
request
on
a
post-conviction
hearing
and
we
did
do
this.
this
was
done
last
spring,
the
federal
did
assume
jurisdiction.
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
yes,
under
the
feather
case.
after
the
feather
case
came
out
--
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
after
the
feather
case
came
out
via
the
state
circuit
court
--
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
right
and
our
state
circuit
court
out
there
is
a
court
of
trial
court.
in
fact,
january
1st
we
are
only
going
to
have
one
court.
it's
all
going
to
be
the
state
circuit
court.
but,
that's
what
we
did
is
came
back
state
--
reality
vacated
the
sentence
on
the
thing
the
feds
came
in
and
arrested
him
and
i
pled
him
guilty
for
the
same
charge
in
federal
court
which
was
a
murder
charge
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
but,
they
were
very
dubious
of
the
state
jurisdiction
and
indians
i
think
we
can
say
as
a
whole
very
much
dislike
the
state
jurisdiction
--
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
well,
they
seemingly
don't
have
any
other
objection
and
they
think
that
they
get
more
justice
in
the
federal
court.
i
am
not
going
to
try
and
say
they
do,
i
have
confidence
in
our
state
court,
but
nevertheless,
these
indians
do
not
seem
to
feel
that
way
and
i
think
that,
that
is
one
factor
that
is
very
hard
to
control
the
people
when
they
feel
that
they
aren't
getting
justice.
it
is
very,
very
difficult.
as
far
as
this
tribal
resolution
is
concerned
that
has
been
brought
up
here,
i
have
been
advised
that
this
was
vacated
very
soon
after
it
was
enacted
--
tried
to
be
enacted,
they
could
see
the
fallacy,
it
was
explained
by
a
counsel
where
they
were
off
on
the
wrong
foot
on
the
thing.
but,
the
big
thing
that
this
feather
case
has
is
not
going
onto
the
civil
part
of
questions
that
have
been
propounded,
i
realize
that
they
can
come
in
indirectly.
but,
that
is
coming
on
to
this
federal
jurisdiction
and
this
of
course,
starts
out
a
long
ways
back.
i
think
one
thing
that
comes
onto
this
federal
jurisdiction,
that
hasn't
been
brought
out
here
today,
we
brought
it
out
in
our
brief.
and
that
is
in
1901,
the
state
ceded
all
federal
criminal,
ceded
to
the
federals,
all
state
jurisdiction
over
federal
offenses,
and
in
1903
the
federals
assumed
this
jurisdiction.
we
have
this
in
our
brief
and
it's
a
thing
that
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
and
i
argued
this
to
them,
when
we
did
argue
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
(inaudible)
i
argued
in
demarrias,
i
was
a
culprit
on
demarrias
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
as
well.
i
wasn't
able
to
do
the
chores
that
i
should
have,
but
i
nevertheless
was
there.
but,
in
the
second
time,
in
feather
case,
this
was
brought
up,
it
wasn't
a
controlling
factor
by
then
because
they
felt,
as
we
can
very
well
see
their
position
that
this
mattz
case,
the
newtown
case,
the
condon
case,
the
seymour
case,
all
came
in
and
answered
this
question
perhaps
easier,
perhaps
in
a
different
way,
perhaps
more
definitely
than
it
was
handled
or
could
be
handled
by
this
1903
and
this
1901
act.
it
is
a
little
bit
interesting
to
me
--
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
in
1901,
our
state
legislature
ceded
to
the
federal
government
all
of
the
jurisdiction
over
all
indian
country
and
in
1903
the
federal
government
assumed
this
jurisdiction.
so,
regardless
--
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
no,
it
does
not.
it
does
not
and
as
i
say,
we
have
set
forth
that
in
the
brief
here
on
the
bench.
i
believe
that
it
comes
back
very
directly
here
on
all
of
these
points
here
that
we
have
before
us,
is
what
is
this
jurisdiction.
we
feel
that
the
case
that
we
have
before
us,
as
far
as
a
criminal
is
concerned
is
very,
very
much
on
a
par
with
the
seymour
case,
but
it's
on
a
par
with
the
newtown
case
which
is
of
course
up
there
in
our
federal
district
court
with
the
mattz
case
that
it
definitely
does
reverse
demarrias.
there
is
no
question
about
that,
that
has
been
spoken
of
here
today.
but,
in
order
to
reverse
this
and
go
back
to
demarrias,
we
believe
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
reverse
also
the
seymour
case.
in
fact,
after
the
seymour
case,
our
state
supreme
court
in
molash
(ph)
came
down
with
a
very
nice
decision
on
another
circuit.
they
reversed
some
other
decisions
there,
perhaps
pick
on
them
for
the
minute
that
they
did
not
in
their
decision
say
that
they
were
reversing.
they
just
went
ahead
with
it,
they
came
on
to
those
different
parts
there.
but
we
believe
that
we
have
to
go
back
to
this
original
case
of
celestine
which
definitely
has
the
principle
that
congress
is
the
only
one
that
can
diminish
this
reservation.
that
congress
has
not
diminished,
has
not
seen
fit
to
diminish
this
reservation.
by
1151
in
itself
and
1151
especially
with
the
footnotes
and
1153
with
the
footnotes,
as
is
brought
out
in
our
brief
here
on
the
thing,
definitely
goes
on
the
principle
that
congress
is
annoyingly,
is
assuming
jurisdiction
on
all
of
the
reservation,
not
just
the
part
that
is
trust
land
as
the
state
would
have
us
believe.
and
that's
the
only
thing
that
makes
sense.
if
we
don't
have
such
a
situation
as
that,
we
have
the
thing
that
was
brought
up
right
here
to
start
with
and
that
is
a
checkerboard,
that
is
a
thing
that
this
court
in
seymour
wanted
to
stray
away
from,
wanted
to
keep
away
from
on
the
thing
and
they
so
ably
set
it
out
in
seymour
on
the
thing,
and
if
we
don't
have
federal
jurisdiction
of
this
whole
reservation,
we
will
come
right
back
into
this
thing
that
you
try
to
guard
against
in
the
seymour
case
and
that
is
a
checker
boarded
situation,
someone
would
have
called
it
a
crazy
quilt
situation.
mr.
larry
r.
gustafson
i
didnâ€™t
get
that
idea
and
definitely
from
seymour,
that
is
what
this
court
attempted
to
avoid,
in
fact
they
set
it
out
i
think
very,
very
plainly.
the
state
in
that
instance
wanted
to
interpret
this
as
not
withstanding
the
issuance
of
any
patent,
to
mean,
not
withstanding
the
issuance
of
any
patent
to
an
indian.
but
the
state
does
not
suggest,
nor
can
we
find,
any
adequate
justification
for
the
interpretation.
the
issue
has
been
squarely
put
to
rest
by
congressional
enactment
of
the
recently
prevailing
definition
of
indian
country
in
1151
to
include
all
land
within
the
limits
of
any
indian
reservation
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
government
not
withstanding
the
issuance
of
any
patent.
and
thank
you.
