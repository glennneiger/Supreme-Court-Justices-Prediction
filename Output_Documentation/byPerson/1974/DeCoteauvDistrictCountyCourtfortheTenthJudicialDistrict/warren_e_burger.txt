mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
hirsch.
mr.
day.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
what
you
say
i
take
it,
there
could
be
a
90
acre
track
that
would
be
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction
and
all
of
the
surrounding,
immediately
surrounding
contiguous
areas,
state
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
are
some
of
them
90
acres,
are
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
assume
it
was
very
small
anyway.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
great
many.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
great
many
of
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
day,
i
think
your
time
is
all
consumed.
mr.
hirsch,
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
hear
arguments
in
73-1500
erickson
against
feather.
mr.
day,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready
with
this
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
point
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
central
issues,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
doing
all
of
this
record
then
publicly
or
do
they
in
the
eighth
circuit,
i'm
not
familiar,
mr.
justice
blackmun
knows
the
practice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
his
circuit--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
may
want
to
save
a
little
time
for
rebuttal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sachse?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
united
states
in
those
transactions
was
acting
as
the
broker
for
the
indians
to
announce
publicly
that
settlers
could
come
in
and
buy
it
for
$2.50
half
an
acre?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
laying
aside
the
major
crimes
question,
and
you
had
a
very
simple
statement
that
i
understood
throughly,
for
a
moment
or
two
there,
when
you
said
it
doesn't
depend
on
geography
or
plats,
it
depends
on
the
racial
origin.
now,
were
you
confining
that
to
reservations
as
you
suggested
first
or
for
indian
country.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
on
our
time
for
a
minute
or
a
two
here.
mr.
justice
white,
do
you
have
a
further
question?
we
will
hear
from
your
friend
then,
mr.
gustafson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
that
justice
hughes
in
his
first
ten
year
on
this
court,
way
back
conceded
that
there
was
bound
to
be
a
checker
board
as
you
call
it,
checker
board
situation
with
this
hotchâ‹…potch
of
laws
and
treaties,
i
may
have
misread
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
day
if
you
can
finish
in
ten
minutes,
we
will
finish
today
and
let
you
get
back
to
the
indian
country,
otherwise
we
will
go
over
till
tomorrow.
do
you
think,
you
can
finish
in
ten
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
