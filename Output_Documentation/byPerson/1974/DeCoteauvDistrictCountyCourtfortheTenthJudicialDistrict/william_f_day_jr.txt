mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
if
this
land
in
question,
the
boundaries
thereof,
the
perimeters
are
an
indian
reservation,
the
state
of
south
dakota
doesn't
have
any
jurisdiction.
if
this
land,
except
for
the
allotments
thereon
has
been
ceded,
then
the
state
of
south
dakota
does
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
no
sir,
not
that
difficult.
no
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
truly.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes,
i
do
sir.
and
i
will
go
into
and
i
can
go
onto
now
if
you
like.
i
would
like
to
show
the
court
the
position
of
the
state
of
south
dakota
on
this
map
that
is
part
of
the
government’s
amicus
brief
and
the
back
of
it,
and
we
can
kind
of
--
we
had
the
colville
case's
warning
in
the
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation
was
ceded
or
it
was
restored
to
the
public
domain.
now,
in
1887,
they
started
the
general
allotment
act
and
senator
dawes
started
that.
and
that
let
the
secretary
of
the
interior
whenever
he
thought
it
for
the
best
interest
of
the
indians
and
there
were
surplus
land
to
allot
these
indians
or
not
allot
them
as
he
saw
it
fit,
and
sell
off
whatever
portion
of
their
surplus
reservation
that
they
wanted
to.
so
if
the
north
half,
for
example
of
the
colville
reservation
was
ceded,
that
would
leave
and
did
leave
the
south
half.
the
north
half
boundaries
would
be
no
more
because
when
they
ceded
it,
they
would
necessarily
by
metes
and
bounds
or
something
strike
a
line
across
where
it
was
ceded
and
the
north
half
was
no
more.
now
this
is
in
effect,
what
happened
in
the
sisseton-wahpeton
reservation.
the
secretary
of
interior
acquainted
to
commission
to
go
out
and
treat
with
these
indians
for
the
sell
of
their
land,
and
they
did.
and
under
the
agreement
and
the
wording
of
the
1889
and
1891
act,
they
ceded,
sold,
relinquished,
and
conveyed
all
interest
in
all
of
their
lands
that
had
been
-–
except
the
ones
that
had
been
allotted
or
were
going
to
be
alloted.
so
in
effect,
what
that
did
if
we
can
show
this
court
that
the
cede
is
strong
enough
and
the
words
are
strong
enough
in
the
legislative
history,
that
wiped
out
the
boundaries
of
this
reservation
and
left
the
allotments
sitting
there
on
the
public
domain.
now
this
gets
into
further
--
our
position
of
the
state
as
to
what
is
indian
country,
and
in
1948,
they
defined
by
statute
indian
country,
1151(a)
and
for
our
purposes
1151(c).
now
1151(a)
defined
indian
country
is
all
land
within
an
indian
reservation
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
except
notwithstanding
patents
and
,
including
rights-of-way.
now
that
would
be
under
the
south
half
of
the
colville
reservation,st
1151(a).
that
had
not
been
opened
or
it
had
not
been
ceded
and
that
would
be
the
south
half
of
the
colville.
now
1151(c)
indian
country
is
defined
as
all
indian
allotments,
the
indian
title
to
which
has
not
been
extinguished
and
this
is
the
north
half
of
the
colville
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
the
colville
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
am
giving
that
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
this
is
sisseton-wahpeton
map,
but
i
am
giving
that
as
an
example
--
the
same
thing
had
happened
here
only
in
1892,
there
was
some
argument
made
here
--
you
have
got
to
have
a
boundary
and
i
am
saying
in
the
colville
they
had
a
boundary
because
they
only
took
away
half
of
it.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
no
sir,
here,
they
took
away
all
of
it
which
left
this
under
1151(c)
and
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
consequently,
the
state
of
south
dakota
is
not
after
any
indian
reservation
because
we
don't
--
we
have
indian
reservations
in
south
dakota,
in
rosebud,in
the
pine
ridge,
that
ceased
to
be
an
indian
reservation
and
i
think
under
that
theory
now,
this
leads
us
your
honor,
with
some
checkerboard
jurisdiction
and
1151(c)
was
actually
statutorized
under
united
states
versus
pelican
case
and
in
pelican,
in
the
pelican
case
they
recognized
that
there
was
going
to
be
some
checkerboard
jurisdiction.
if
i
may
quote
a
moment
on
page
399
of
the
pelican
decision.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
232
us
442,
and
on
page
399,
there
is
a
statement,
it
is
said
that
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
congress
has
intended
to
maintain
the
federal
jurisdiction
over
hundreds
of
allotments
scattered
through
territory,
other
portions
of
which
were
open
to
white
settlement.
but
congress
expressly
so
provided
with
respect
to
offenses
committed
in
violation
of
the
act
of
1897,
nor
does
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
depend
upon
the
size
of
the
particular
areas
which
are
held
for
federal
purposes
and
they
contemplate
and
until
--
and
these
indian
allotments
which
are
trust
allotments
as
what
they
call
trust
patents,
it's
been
historically
that
they
go
away,
some
were
sold,
there
would
be
a
lot
less
allotments
here
in
my
guess
now
than
there
would
have
been
back
in
1891
for
example,
because
they
are
issued
fees
on
them
upon
proper
application
and
they
are
sold.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
i
can't
tell
for
sure
how
long
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
there
surely
could
be
some,
and
if
you
look
here,
there
is
tracks
of
land
together.
i
don't
know
that
if
this
map
constitutes
a
section
as
one
mile
because
when
i
counted
squares
on
it
the
other
day,
it
didn't
come
up
to
a
120
miles,
it
only
come
up
to
about
75.
so
i
don't
for
sure
if
that's
if
each
one
of
those
squares
represents
a
mile
or
not.
but
that
is
true
under
1151
c
your
honor,
is
exactly
what
you
stated.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
tribal
jurisdiction
would
be
to
indian
allotments
only.
triable
and/or
federal.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
they
could.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
it's
my
understanding
your
honor
that
recently
the
tribal
counsel
passed
an
ordinance
assuming
civil
and
criminal
jurisdictions
over
non-indian
persons.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes.
well
in
this
whole
reservation
because
of
the
feather
case.
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
next
case
we
are
having,
said
that
this,
they
reversed
themselves
and
said
now,
we
didn't
see
it
this
back
in
1891,
so
they'd
have
jurisdictions
through
all
over.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
the
eighth
circuit
didn't
decide
that.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
they
have
passed
an
ordinance,
i
believe,
yes.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
the
state
of
south
dakota
doesn't
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
no
sir.
another
interesting
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
well
i
don't
believe
so
sir,
there
wouldn't
be
--
i
live
out
near
the
rosebud
reservation
and
it's
got
be
about
the
same.
there
wouldn't
be
very
many
non-indians
living
on
alloted
lands,
but
they
would
at
least
allot
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
you
say
a
non-indian
on
a
non-indian
on
alloted
land,
i
believe
that
the
state
of
south
dakota
would
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
over
indians
on
alloted
land.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
oh
sure,
we
would
claim
that.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
well
i
wouldn't
say
too
many.
i
would
say
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
but
we
would
have
jurisdiction
in
my
opinion
over
the
non-indians.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
well,
they
don't
have
what
jurisdiction
they
attempt
to
take
your
honor
under
the
ordinance.
i
am
saying
that
state
has
jurisdiction,
but
now
they
have
passed
an
ordinance
saying
that
they
also
have
jurisdiction
over
all
people
within
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
okay.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
well
yes,
it
does.
it
depends
on
it
to
the
extent
of
all
this
original
1867
area.
otherwise
and
if
we
are
correct,
there
is
no
area
except
indian
country
on
these
red
dots
which
are
trust
patterns
or
trust
allotments
in
indian
land.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
there
could
be
through
lease.
most
of
the
land
down
in
rosebud
area,
is
leased
by
ranchers
and
there
could
be
some
improvements,
that
would
be
unusual,
but
it
could
be,
it
could
happen.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
oh
yes,
yes
that's
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
right,
right.
are
there
any
other
questions
around
the
like
that?
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
okay.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
be
federal,
it
could
be
one
of
the
ten
major
crimes
which
would
be
exclusively
in
the
federal
court
then.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
on
white
on
white,
it's
not
going
to
make
any
difference,
but
sir
where
you
have
problems
or
where
you
could
have,
since
1891
the
state
of
south
dakota
has
assumed
jurisdiction
over
all
of
this
area,
except
on
the
allotments
over
indians
and
whites.
now,
you
have
a
situation,
if
feather
holds
up,
where
if
you
have
an
indian
and
a
white
in
a
fight
for
example,
so
the
state
court
is
going
to
have
to
go
out
and
arrest
the
white
man,
the
tribal
court's
going
to
have
to
go
out
and
arrest
the
indian.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
it
could
and
then
you
would
be
forcing.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
i
don't
think
they
have
the
excess
of
that.
they
have
done
it
but
i
don't
know
what
they
have
done
how
far
that
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yeah,
probably.
but
then
your
honor
you
are
putting,
you
are
into
another
altogether
different
situation
or
the
state
has
been
handling
this
and
assuming
it
since
1891
up
until
the
feather
decision
in
1970
and
1972.
i
think
it's
the
first
time
after
that
the
tribes
had
a
force
up
there.
but
i'll
get
on
with
the
balance
of
it.
we
are
saying
your
honor
that
cede,
sell,
relinquish
and
convey
all
right
title
in
interest
is
stronging
enough
as
in
the
case
of
alice
v.
page.
it's
stronging
enough
to
grant
session
just
like
the
words
public
domain
were
used.
in
the
brief
there,
we
have
looked
this
up
in
the
webster's
dictionary
and
the
word
cede
in
other
dictionaries
and
the
word
cede
is
what
generally
is
used
when
one
country
grants
session
to
another
country.
they've
made
some
statements,
well
maybe
you
should
have
cede
absolutely
maybe
that's
alright
or
maybe
you
should
have
cede
absolutely
and
for
ever
like
in
alice
v.
page.
but
i
think
once
you
cede,
convey,
relinquish
all
right,
title
and
interest.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
no
sir,
this
was
a
direct
session
where
in
the
state
of
south
dakota,
when
the
federal
government
bought
this
land
from
this
tribe
for
$
2.50
an
acre
plus
some
other
consideration,
they
bought
it
outright.
in
turn,
they
went
back
and
sold
it
to
the
settlers
for
the
same
price.
but
it
was
not
the
same
money
and
it's
not
like
the
mattz
case
it's
not
like
the
new
town
case
or
seymour
which
wasn't
--
which
was
a
trustee
homestead
type
relationship.
in
this
case
is
the
session
agreement
and
it's
different
than
that.
in
those
cases,
the
government
didn't
guarantee
to
sell
the
land,
the
tribe
didn't
get
paid
until
the
land
was
sold
and
settled
by
the
homesteader,
this
was
a
direct
session.
even
though
in
the
--
which
i'll
get
to
in
the
other
case,
even
though
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
it
wasn't,
but
it
absolutely
is.
this
bill
in
the
1891
act
when
it
was
passed,
there
were
about
seven
other
reservations
and
this
was
tacked
on
to
the
indian
general
allotment
act.
senator
dawes
who
wrote
the
1887
dawes
act
or
general
allotment
act
also
was
the
main
senator
on
this
bill.
senator
dawes
prior
to
the
time,
the
bill
passed
made
the
statement
that
all
7
or
8
million
of
acres
of
land
going
in
there
that
day
was
going
to
be
restored
to
the
public
domain.
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
in
1890
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
bill
said
this
land
is
going
to
be
restored
to
the
public
domain
and
specifically
mentioned
sisseton
and
wahpeton,
660
thousand
acres
roughly
and
i
imagine
the
reason
he
mentioned
it
because
it
was
sold
for
$2.50
an
acre
and
rest
was
$1.50
an
acre.
the
department
of
interior
reports
also
confirm
this.
from
that
time
on,
from
1892
the
official
maps
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
for
several
years
wiped
it
off.
everything
then
was
referred
to
as
former
sisseton
wahpeton.
then
we
get
going
down
going
down
the
road
for
several
years
and
then
the
maps
changed,
they
might
get
a
circle
around
it
that
says
former
reservation
or
it
might
be
later
on
shaded
in
enough.
i
think
a
map
that
you
have
up
here
today
that
i
thought
i
saw,
shows
the
indian
reservation
day
as
the
original
sisseton
and
wahpeton
indian
reservation
as
it
was
back
in
1867.
and
i
am
suggesting
your
honors
that
in
order
to
determine
congregational
intent
or
legislative
history,
all
that
is
needed
to
be
done
in
this
case
is
to
go
back
to
the
act,
prior
to
the
act,
after
the
act
look
at
what
senator
dawes
says
who
was
primarily
responsible
for
the
act.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
he
was
from
massachusetts,
i
believe
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
i
surely
don't
know.
we
think
your
honors
that
the
session
language
that
you
don't
have
to
go
any
further
than
the
face
of
the
act.
south
dakota
came
into
being
as
a
state
in
1889,
in
the
enabling
act,
congress
stated
that
south
dakota
when
it
came
and
was
to
be
a
state
received
section
16
and
36
as
school
sections.
but
it
specifically
said
that
if
any
of
these
sections
or
any
of
this
land
was
in
an
indian
reservation,
that
the
grant
did
not
take
effect
until
the
reservation
had
been
extinguished
and
the
property
and
the
reservation
restored
to
the
public
domain,
that's
in
section
10
of
the
enabling
act
which
brought
us
into
statehood.
i
am
suggesting
that
this
is
further
intention
to
show
that
the
intent
of
every
one
at
that
time
was
to
seed
the
reservation,
accept
these
allotments,
extinguish
the
boundaries
and
you've
had
left
what
in
1948
is
determined
as
indian
country
under
1151(c).
there
is
also
another
school
land
section
in
the
act
and
that
might
not
be,
that's
open
to
interpretation
they
have
argued
about
it.
in
the
brief,
this
provision
was
taken
to
the
english
department
at
the
university
of
south
dakota
and
they
gave
an
opinion
that
the
phrase
modified
not
just
the
school
land
section
16
and
36
but
modified
all
of
the
land
being
open
to
the
laws
or
subject
to
laws
of
state
of
south
dakota.
i
am
suggesting
your
honors
that,
if
the
act
is
read
in
the
legislative
history
surrounding
this
act
is
determined
that
it's
clear
under
the
rule
set
forth
in
mattz,
that
this
reservation
in
1891
was
terminated.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
indians
are
citizens
of
the
state
of
south
dakota
your
honor
and
we
always
have
exercised
jurisdiction
over
indians
and
non-indians
alike
in
this
area
for
almost
80
years
and
now,
when
it
repairs
that
they
are
going
to
be
under
two
or
different
laws,
it's
really
causing
a
lot
of
commotion.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
the
impact
your
honor
might
not
be
as
great
when
you
have
one
class
of
people
that
you
wouldn't
have
to
worry
about.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
it's
true.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
i
would
say
that
yes.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
i
think
wherever
there
is
an
alloted
land,
the
state
does
not
have
jurisdiction
overt
regardless
if
it's
in
the
ceded
portion
or
if
it's
in
the
open
portion
or
closed
portion.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir.
excuse
me
for
being
slow.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
no.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
state
of
south
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
state
of
south
dakota
your
honor.
i
went
across
one
of
those
cases,
i
am
sure
the
other
day
that
said
that,
but
the
state
does
--
we
exercise
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
in
todd
county
south
dakota,
what
we
are
claiming
to
be
the
rules
by
the
indian
reservation.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
we
do.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
will
sit
down,
thank
you.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
this
case
involves
the
same
alleged
reservation,
only
this
case
originated
out
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
and
this
is
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
these
ten
indian
gentlemen,
i
believe,
they're
ten
of
them
in
here,
were
all
confined
and
convicted
in
the
south
dakota
penitentiary
for
offenses
for
which
they
have
been
convicted
within
the
original
boundaries
of
the
sisseton–wahpeton
former
indian
reservation.
the--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
various
offenses.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
all
on
free
land,
free
simple
land,
non-alloted
land,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
the
ten
major
crimes
do
not
apply
when
we're
not
in
indian
--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes,
it
would
apply,
but
it
didn't
get--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
right.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
none
of
these--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
none
of
these
--
well,
i
think
may
--
i
don't
know,
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
no
sir,
not
if
the
state
of
south
dakota
has
jurisdiction.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
the
law
or
the
case
law
that
really
developed
on
the
sisseton
and
wahpeton,
an
indian
reservation
were
four
demarrias,
indian
cases.
two
of
them
were
in
the
supreme
court
of
--
i
believe
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota
and
second
one
of
those
cases,
this
court
denied
certiorari.
the
first
two
cases,
all
decided
that
the
sisseton
and
wahpeton
land
area
had
been
ceded
by
the
act
of
1891.
the
federal
district
court,
judge
beck
also
held
that
and
this
case
came
into
the
circuit
court
of
appeals,
either
argued
at
st.
paul
or
st.
louis.
in
1963,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
st.
louis
upheld
this
very
action
and
said
that
the
lands
had
been
ceded
and
this
was
not
indian
reservation.
in
1963,
if
i
have
my
date
correct,
the
justice
department
of
the
united
states
also
argued
that
the
land,
the
reservation
had
been
terminated.
in
1973,
they've
had
a
change
of
policy
and
they
argued
that
the
reservation
was
there
according
to
the
boundaries
back
in
1867,
and
so
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
overruled
along
line
of
cases,
in
fact,
overruled
themselves
on
this
area
in
south
dakota.
our
argument,
our
main
thrust
of
why
they
did
it
is
that
they
blanketly
applied
mattz,
seymour,
the
newtown's
decisions
to
this
reservation,
former
reservation,
it
gets
confusing.
our
argument,
simply,
is
this.
the
mattz
cases
and
the
seymour
case
and
this
case,
can
easily
be
distinguished.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
overrule
your
case
of
mattz
or
your
case
of
seymour.
those
cases,
evidently
were
decided
on
the
rule
set
up
by
this
court
and
for
example,
in
mattz,
they
tried
to
open
that
reservation
for
a
long
time
and
couldn't
get
the
job
done
and
your
rulings
were
right
there.
but
those
two
cases
were
decided
on
the
trustee,
homestead
provision,
wherein
the
government,
bartered
for
this
land
from
the
tribe
but
they
didn't
guarantee
the
sale
of
it.
they
said,
we'll
put
it
up
for
sale
for
you,
we'll
have
it
homesteaded.
when
that's
paid
for,
then
the
money
will
be
in
trust
for
you.
that
was
the
fatal
error
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
feather
case
that
this
was
not
a
session
agreement
and
it
absolutely
was.
it
said
it's
like
mattz
and
seymour,
a
trustee
type
deal.
feather,
i
don't
know
why
they
decided
that,
but
i
think
just
in
the
glair
of
mattz
and
seymour.
now,
all
of
the
cases
or
all
of
the
reservations
in
1891
in
this
indian
allotment
act
of
which
sisseton-wahpeton
was
a
part,
as
far
as
we
have
been
able
to
determine,
we
are
restored
to
the
public
domain
and
they
were
different.
some
had
public
domain
wording,
some
had
wording
like
this,
the
crow
act
had
a
little
different
wording,
but
by
the
legislative
history,
by
the
face
of
the
act,
we
could
determine,
and
from
what
senator
dawes
says,
it
was
going
to
do,
the
seven
or
eight
million
acres
went
to
the
public
domain.
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
says
that
a
session
isn't
a
session
and
in
the
briefs
sometimes
we
are
arguing
that
public
domain
isn't
public
domain,
cede
and
sell
doesn't
mean
cede
and
sell
and
it's
down
to
the
point,
your
honors,
that
this
area
as
so
far
as,
as
can
be
possibly
done,
should
be
decided
because,
since
newtown
and
mattz
and
seymour,
this
is
breaking
out,
the
litigation
allover
and
i
don't
see
any
ending
site.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
i
believe
that
they
applied
for
a
rehearing
in
the
eighth
circuit
in
which
i
was
not
involved
sir,
but
i'm
sure
they
did?
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
no.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
i
don't
believe,
we
did.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
i--
major
crime
act.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
i'll
have
to
ask
justice
blackmun.
i
think
they
do
sometimes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
no.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
well,
judge
lay
in
a
dissenting
opinion
a
few
years
ago,
i
think,
brought
all
of
this
indian
problems
to
light
and--
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
miner
v.
erickson,
it
was,
your
honor,
and
we
think
that
if
the
state
court
decisions
are
read
on
the
law
and
that
the
1963
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals
demarrias
has
read,
in
light
of
what
we
have
argued
here
today
that
we
should
go
back
to
the
demarrias
and
it's
distinguishable,
we're
clear
on
the
face
and
i
think
that's
all
i
have
to
say,
unless
there
are
some
questions.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
well,
i
would
like
to
sir.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
william
f.
day,
jr.
yes,
i
can
sir.
your
honors,
my
brother
mr.
sachse
says
that
this
is
almost
like
the
situation
in
mattz,
it's
almost
a
trustee
relationship.
it
really
does
the
same
thing
because
you
are
putting
it
in
out
of
one
till
into
the
other,
and
that's
the
problem.
it
isn't
the
same,
it's
clearly
not
the
same
on
the
face
of
the
act.
it's
a
direct
session
and
sale,
it's
not
the
same
money,
the
government
doesn't
do
the
same
things,
it's
not
the
same
wording.
and
if
it's
clearly
plain,
it
should
be
left
clearly
plain.
counsel,
my
brother
mr.
gustafson,
i
am
sure,
has
been
states
attorney
in
his
area,
as
i
have
down
close
to
my
reservation.
i
don't
know
my
brother
sachse's
information,
plat
book
or
checkerboard
jurisdiction
for
officers
that
grow
up
and
live
in
that
country
is
no
big
problem,
because
in
most
instances,
the
land
is
leased
by
people
and
most
of
the
crimes
are
committed
in
the
towns
where
it's
normally
all,
mostly
all
fee
patented
and
there
is
no
problem.
speaking
personally,
if
i
can
for
a
moment,
i
was
also
a
tribal
judge
for
about
five
years
out
in
the
rosebud
indian.
i
probably
was
only
a
white
tribal
judge
in
the
united
states.
i
think,
i
know,
how
it
is,
on
closed
portions
of
reservations,
on
1151
(a)
and
it's
also
on
1151
(c),
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
was
this,
the
boundaries
of
this
reservation
diminished?
if
they
were
on
the
face
of
the
act
this
court
should
say
so.
if
they
weren't
on
the
face
of
the
act,
but
were
by
surrounding
history,
legislative
intent
then
the
court
under
its
own
rules
should
say
so.
and
i
believe
that
if
--
i
know
you
will
read
them,
i
believe
that
it's
clear,
first
on
the
face
and
if
not
but
both
ways.
when
you
sum
it
all
up,
it
comes
up
to
about
98
anyway.
thank
you.
