justice
potter
stewart
well,
where
are
you
reading
from?
i'm
in
your
appendix.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
beginning--
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
you're
reading
from
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
mattz?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you're
reading
from
a
part
of
page
26.
justice
potter
stewart
okay.
justice
potter
stewart
same
as
this
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
given
to
us
on
a
different
case,
but
it
is
united
states
department
of
the
interior,
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
indian
land
areas
general.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
total
population?
justice
potter
stewart
or
would
be--
justice
potter
stewart
let's
take
this
case
if
these
have
been
non-indians,
in
other
words.
justice
potter
stewart
why
if
this
is
reservation?
justice
potter
stewart
beg
your
pardon.
justice
potter
stewart
williams
against
lee
said
the
--
if
i
have
the
case
in
mind,
promptly
said
that
the
state
courts
did
not
have
jurisdiction
and
that
was
the
case
where
non-indian
plaintiff
was
suing
an
indian
defendant,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
state
courts
does
not
have
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
a--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
is,
as
put
by
my
brother
white,
what
if
in
this
very
case,
these
people
had
been
non-indians
but
this
mother
had
been
a
non-indian
and
the
children
would
have
been
non-indians
and
the
acts
had
occurred
just
as
they
did
occur.
if
this
is
a
reservation
that
would
have
given
the
tribal
counsel
and
its
course,
jurisdiction,
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
case
particularly
says
that?
justice
potter
stewart
for
any
case?
justice
potter
stewart
which
held
that
the
state
did
not
have
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
now
i
am
interested
in
any
case
or
cases,
do
you
know
--
let’s
say
that
the
state
does
have
jurisdiction
over
people
living
on
an
indian
reservation.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
federal
criminal
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
where
i
am
talking
about
the
state.
not
just
any
case
or
cases
that
say
that
the
state
may
exert
its
power,
its
law,
criminal
or
civil,
over
people
living
on
an
indian
reservation?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no.
i
think
--
i
don’t
want
to
be
repetitious
but
perhaps,
let
me
just
say
it
once
more,
over
people
living
on
an
indian
reservation,
non-indians
let’s
assume
they
are,
and
this
is
not
a
public
law
280
state.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
questions
from
the
bench
indicate
that
the
significance
of
this
case
may
go
much
further,
that's
the
point
of
the
question,
as
i
understood.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
been
ceded
mr.
day,
wouldn't
you
have
an
extraordinarily
difficult
problem
of
administering
a
law
civil
or
criminal,
if
it
would
be
on
a
patchwork
basis
of
everything
that's
quite
there
being
under
the
jurisdiction
of
south
dakota
and
everything
that's
read
being
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribe?
justice
potter
stewart
i
would
be
in
interested
in
knowing
some
time
when
the
court
argument
is
going
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
confusing
me.
justice
potter
stewart
the
colville
case
we
argued
this
morning?
justice
potter
stewart
this
map
is
of
something
else
and
the
difference
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
here
we
don't
have
that
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
under
1151
(c)
everything,
didn't
read
there,
is
indian
country
as
so
defined.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
you
will
cite
--
well,
do
it
just
later.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
tribal
jurisdiction
on
this
checkerboard
design.
what
would
be
as
to
lot
of
lands
only,
is
that
your
position?
justice
potter
stewart
without
regard
to
whether
those
living
on
the
alloted
lands
were
indians
or
non-indians?
non
indians
can
live
on
alloted
lands?
justice
potter
stewart
and
would
jurisdiction
in
that
instance
being
with
the
tribal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
any
breakdown
to
these
30,000
non-indians
living
on
alloted
lands,
does
the
record
tell
us
anything
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was
non-indians
living
on
alloted
land,
you
have
good
many
non-indians
living
on
alloted
lands,
don't
you
on
this
reservation?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
no
matter
what
whether
civil
or
criminal.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
they
live
on
these
alloted
lands,
if
they
are
non-indian
tribal
courts
have
no
jurisdictions?
justice
potter
stewart
now
would
there
be
any
non-indians
living
on
those
trust
allotments,
and
if
so,
how
and
why
would
they?
justice
potter
stewart
the
reclaim.
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
sorry
you
are
being
--
it's
on
both
sides
here.
justice
potter
stewart
what
happens
mr.
day
in
a
reservation
which
is
clearly
and
concededly
a
reservation,
let's
take
the
rosebud
reservation
in
your
state?
now
who
has
jurisdiction
there
over
civil
controversy
between
two
non-indians?
justice
potter
stewart
non-indians.
justice
potter
stewart
well
and
you
recognize
it
clearly
as
a
reservation.
justice
potter
stewart
everybody
does.
justice
potter
stewart
these
were
for
various
offenses.
justice
potter
stewart
and
all
took
place
on
non-alloted?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
guess
none
of
these
offenses
was,
that
was
complicated
further
was
under
that
ten
major
crimes
act
of
the
federal
legislation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know,
but
if
you
were,
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
none
of
these
crimes
may
have
been
within
that
list
of
ten.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
whether--
justice
potter
stewart
those
are
the
serious
criminals.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
state's
job?
and
what
does
the
state
do
on
an
indian
reservation?
on
indian
reservation
what
is
the
state's
responsibility?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
generally
or
that's
true
if
it's
on
a
reservation?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
otherwise?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
if
any
of
patented
land
is
indian
country,
by
statutory
definition,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
had
--
if
the
court
should
hold
that?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
as
my
brother
white
suggested?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
court
should
decide
that
statute,
the
session
statute
didn't
amount
to
a
conveyance,
then
the
result
would
be,
that
the
state
would
no
longer
have
any
power
to
enforce
its
laws
in
any
of
these
several
counties,
if
any
indian
was
involved.
justice
potter
stewart
if
this
is
an
indian
reservation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
the
vast
proportion
of
the
--
this
is
something
like
what
27,000
non-indians
and
few
3,000
plus
indians
tracked
in
this
lake
traverse
area.
justice
potter
stewart
which
means
that
whenever
they
are
involved
with
an
indian
the
state
does
not
have
any
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
its
civil,
criminal,
or
family,
or
status
law.
justice
potter
stewart
they
are
conceding
it
is
indian
country.
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
a
reservation.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
how
did
you
do
that
under
the
eight
circuit
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
feather
case
was
decided
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
reservation
--
justice
potter
stewart
most
people
don't
like
to
be
tried
in
a
criminal
court?
justice
potter
stewart
i
missed
a
little
bit
what
your
argument
is,
that
happened
in
1901
and
1903.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
question
begging,
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
what
is
indian
country,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
no.
73-1148
--
i
should
have
said
in
the
previous
three
cases
that
mr.
justice
douglas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
those
cases.
in
no.
73-1148,
cheryl

mother
and
next
friend
of

lee

and
herbert
john
spider
versus
the
the
district
county
court
for
the
tenth
judicial
district
of
south

and
in
73-1500,
don
r.
erickson,
warden,
petitioner,
against
john
lee
feather
and
others,
respondent.
the
first
case
being
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota
and
the
second
being
before
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
that
in
these
two
cases,
consolidated
for
a
decision,
the
only
question
that
is
raised
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
lake
traverse
indian
reservation
in
south
dakota,
created
by
an
1867
treaty
between
the
united
states
and
the
sisseton
and
wahpeton
bands
of
sioux
indians,
was
terminated
and
returned
to
the
public
domain,
by
the
act
of
march
3,
1891.
in
each
of
these
two
cases,
the
south
dakota
courts
asserted
jurisdiction
over
members
of
the
sisseton-wahpeton
tribe
for
acts
done
on
lands
which,
though
within
the
1867
reservation
borders,
have
been
owned
and
settled
by
non-indians
since
the
1891
act.
the
parties
agree
that
the
state
courts
did
not
have
jurisdiction
if
these
lands
are
"indian
country,"
as
statutorily
defined,
and
that
this
question
depends
upon
whether
the
lands
retained
reservation
status
after
1891
act
of
congress.
we
hold,
for
the
reasons
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
court's
written
opinion
filed
this
morning
with
the
clerk
that
the
1891
act
terminated
the
lake
traverse
reservation,
and
that
consequently
the
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
conduct
on
non-indian
lands
within
the
1867
reservation
borders.
accordingly,
the
judgment
in
no.
73-1148
is
affirmed
and
the
judgment
in
73-1150
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
to
which
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
subscribed.
