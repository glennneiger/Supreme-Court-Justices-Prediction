justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hirsch
enlighten
me,
why
is
that
particularly
relevant?
i
had
thought
that
domicile
in
an
adaption
case
was
the
standard,
not
where
the
acts
occurred.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
still
ask,
why
is
the
place
where
the
acts
took
place
pertinent?
justice
byron
r.
white
incidentally,
does
the
record
show
where
she
was
domiciled?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
hirsch,
isn't
the
district
court,
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
the
south
dakota
state
court
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
was
there
an
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
circuit
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
918,300,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
27,000
a
difference,
if
you
prevail
here
be
subject
to
tribal
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
enrolled
ones
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
must
be,
that
must
follow
from
the
1891
act.
it's
something
happened
in
the
1891
act
to
the
reservation,
because
of
this
reservation
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
reservation
hasn't
been
disturbed
in
any
way,
the
tribe's
authority
would
extend
everybody
in
this
direction.
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
everybody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
ask
this
way.
after
the
1891
act,
the
tribe's
authority
over-ceded
--
over
the
land
that
was
ceded,
it
was
different
than
it
was
before,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
what
you're
maintaining,
i
know
you're
maintaining,
if
you've
had
authority
over
indians,
did
the
1891
act
changed
the
tribe's
authority
in
anyway
over
the
land
and
those
living
on
it
within
the
area
of
the
reservation
that
you
claim
to
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
concede
or
suppose
you
call
it
the
section
of
--
but
you
think
the
fact
is
that
here
the
tribe
on
this
land
would
have
no
authority
over
non-indian?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
ceded
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
upon
though
was
that
yes,
this
case
does
involve
all
those
people,
all
those
non-indians
for
the
said
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
authority
of
the
state
over
a
non-indian,
living
on
a
ceded
land,
what
about
that
state's
criminal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it's
civil
law
or
child
neglect
law
with
respect
to
a
non-indian
in
a
ceded
country.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
a
280
law
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it's
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
have
it
if
it's
in
the
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
their
indian
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
but
do
you
think
did
the
eighth
circuit
decide
that
the
tribe
had
under
its
decision
would
have
authority
over
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
the
tribe
you
say
has
now
asserted
authority
within
the
entire
area
over
non-indian?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
--
what's
south
dakota's
position,
is
it
your
position
that
you
would
have
authority
over
anybody
who
is
living
on
alloted,
ceded
land?
indians
or
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
non-indians
living
on
alloted
lands?
justice
byron
r.
white
criminal
or
civil?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
claim
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
assume
that,
let's
assume
that
the
non-indian
kills
another
non-indian
on
alloted
land.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
suggesting
that
south
dakota
has
never
attempted
to
apply
a
criminal
law
to
such
situation?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
thought.
you
just
said
a
minute
ago
that
it
wouldn't,
you
were
claiming
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
am
saying
non-indians.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
some.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
just
forget
the
eighth
circuit
decision
just
for
a
moment.
justice
byron
r.
white
south
dakota's
position
historically
has
been,
that
it
does
have
criminal
jurisdiction
at
least
over
non-indians
wherever
they
are
living.
justice
byron
r.
white
within
or
without
indian
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
may
run
and
with
respect
to
civil
jurisdiction,
you
may
have
little
--
it
it's
a
business
transaction
with
indians,
you
may
have
a
problem
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
does
south
dakota's
position
depend
to
a
certain
extent
on
whether
or
not
this
is
in
fact
an
indian
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
lot
of
non-indians
working
on
alloted
lands
is
leased.
there
might
be
people
be
riding
on
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
on
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
be
very
sure
because
i
share
this
confusion.
if
mr.
justice
white's
horseman
is
a
riding
across
alloted
land,
and
he
is
a
non-indian
and
he
is
shot
by
a
non-indian,
the
state
of
south
dakota
assumes
there
is
a
criminal
jurisdiction
over
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
will
be
be
my
opinion,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
is
shot
by
an
indian.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
you
suggest
the
tribe
now
has
an
ordinance
that
would
govern
both
sides
of
the
transaction.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could,
if
you
say
it
has.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
way
to
go
for
the
litigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
agree
with
mr.
hirsch
that
it's
a
special
kind
of
session
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
know
what
state
the
senator
was
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
he
related
to
the
later
vice
president?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
was
also
very
concerned
in
indian
affairs?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
south
dakota's
interest
in
exercising
jurisdiction
over
indians
in
ceded
territory?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
the
state's
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
was
not
disturbed
at
all,
but
the
only
question
is
that
jurisdiction
over
3,000
indians
within
this
area.
you
are
not
going
to
be
disturbed
very
much
are
you?
if
that
were
the
result,
i
understand
that
it
maybe
that
that
wouldn't
be
the
result
that
the
tribe
or
someone
may
claim
that
the
indian,
the
tribal
authority
is
exclusive
within
the
whole
area
with
respect
to
indians
and
non-indians
alike
that
maybe
what
somebody
will
claim.
but
let's
just
assume
for
the
moment,
that
the
only
impact
of
holding
that
the
reservation
was
not
disestablished,
is
that
you
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction
over
3,000
indians.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
are
historically
--
justice
byron
r.
white
historically,
your
position
has
been
that
there
has
been
dual
sovereignty
anyway
in
certain
areas
that
you
have
always
said
that
there
was
dual
sovereignty
on
the
lot
of
the
lands,
the
state
had
authority
over
non-indians
and
the
tribe
had
authority
over
indian.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
been
your
historic
position
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true
in
points
of
the
state
where
this
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
concede
that
the
state
has
jurisdiction
over
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
so
there
is
a
dual
sovereignty
you
would
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
historically
there
hasn't
been
much
claim
to
the
contrary,
has
there?
no
one
has
attempted
to
cut
the
state's
out
of
that,
have
they?
it's
just
been
--
up
to
now
it's
been
historically
it's
been
that
the
government
has
been
interested
in
tribal
authority
over
indians
that's
been.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
apply
for
a
rehearing
in
the
eighth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
get
any
votes?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
important
anyway--
justice
byron
r.
white
except
that
there
are
two
panels
in
demarrias
and
this
is
in
here
were
different
allover,
all
the
judges
are
still
alive
with
one
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
case
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
transaction
is
within
the
indians
they
are
going
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
maybe
debated
eventually
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
we
do
have
the
language
obsession.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
fact,
ceded
is
the
public
domain.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
happened
that
after
they
ceded
the
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
in
public
domain?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
handled
as
a
part
of
a
public
domain
by
the
same
system
there
is
a
public
domain
which--
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
it
impacted
anything
that
the
session
had
followed
by
the
sale
for
homesteading
or
the
settlement
for
homesteading?
what
happened
as
a
consequence,
what
was
the
impact
with
respect
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
things,
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
would
apparently
think
the
state
has
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction
over
non-indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
state's
trespass
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
owner
of
the
deeded
land,
the
ceded
land,
he
now
has
a
fee
simple
title
to
it,
and
he
wants
to
keep
people
off
of
his
land,
and
he
does
it
in
the
name
of
the
state's
trespass
law.
may
he
do
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
really?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
talk
to
you
about
a
non-indian,
can
you
keep
a
non-indian
off
in
the
name
of
the
state's
trespass
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
state's
law
does
apply
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
ask
you
about
transaction
mr.
sachse,
i
asked
you
about
the
states
trespass
law
--
does
the
state
trespass
law
apply
to
that
land?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
state
sovereignty
just
doesn't
apply
to
that
land,
no
matter
whom
it
is
owned
by
as
far
as
keeping
an
indian
off
of
this.
is
that
your
thesis?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
been
the
situation
for
good
many
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
hasn't
been
a
great
deal
for
a
couple
of
others.
has
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
has
to
be
tried
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
was
there
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
anxious
to
have
your
clients
sentenced
under
the
major
crimes
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
anything
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
would
indicate
that
the
state
proceeded
unfairly
against
--
