mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
say
a
word
first
about
any
indian
reservation,
before
talking
about
this
one
because
it
seems
to
me
the
discussion
so
far
has
been
a
bit
confusing
about
that.
in
almost
every
indian
reservation
in
the
country,
there
is
land,
that
has
been
allotted
to
indians,
there
is
land
that
has
been
sold
and
fee
simpled
to
people
who
are
not
indians.
there
is
often
a
large
non-indian
population
inside
an
indian
reservation.
one
of
the
characteristics
of
this
reservation
is
that
there
is
such
a
large
indian
population
inside
it
and
that
there
is
a
going
tribe
within
organized
government
and
agency
of
the
bia
and
very
alive
and
viable
situation.
basically,
and
without
trying
to
go
in
all
of
the
details
of
it,
the
state
in
which
an
indian
reservation
is
situated
has
full
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
who
live
inside
an
indian
reservation,
both
civil
and
criminal
jurisdiction.
this
court
held
so
in
number
of
cases
starting
in
the
19th
century
with
mcbratney
and
draper
which
were
criminal
cases
and
justice
frankfurter
laid
this
out
in
a
good
deal
of
detail
and
cake
versus
eagen
and
the
metlakatla
cases
and
about--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
civil
as
well
as
criminal.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
irrespective
of
where
they
live
within
the
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
correct,
if
the
transaction
is
with
an
indian
or
it
affects
the
vital
interest
of
the
tribe,
they
are
going
to
be
subject
to
federal
law
the
exact
extent
of
that
is
the
kind
of
thing
that's
still
debated
and
it
was
before
even
in
a
case
such
as
the
mazurie
case,
that's
under
advisement.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
and
may
eventually
be
debated
here.
now,
i
think
i
need
to
review
some
law
concerning
this
treaty
as
well
as
this
reservation
as
well
as
the
facts.
first
briefly
the
facts,
a
permanent
reservation
was
established
by
treaty
in
1867
with
surveyed
boundaries,
and
it's
this
reservation
which
was
much
smaller
than
the
land
the
indians
had
previously
had.
they
had
already
had
their
big
loss
of
land,
and
this
was
what
was
left
to
them,
after
great
amounts
of
land
had
been
taken
away
from
them.
then,
by
an
agreement
in
1889
made
specifically
under
the
general
allotment
act
and
at
a
time
when
the
indians
were
in
great
distress,
the
monies
owed
to
them
by
the
federal
government
had
not
been
paid
to
them,
it
was
the
middle
of
winter.
the
federal
government
negotiated
with
the
tribe
to
do
what's
known
as
open
its
reservation.
that
is
to
allow
the
sale
of
surplus
land
within
the
reservation
and
in
this
agreement
and
then
in
the
act
of
congress
that
ratified
it,
there
are
numerous
references
to
the
general
allotment
act,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
was
true
with
the
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation
where
particular
part
of
the
reservation
was
cut
off
and
an
expressed
language
was
used
saying
that,
that
has
been
removed
from
the
reservation,
you
heard
some
talk
that
the
public
domain.
what's
important
in
this
act,
is
there
is
no
language
saying
that
this
was
returned
to
the
public
domain.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
you
do
have
language
obsession
that
is
correct,
but
there
is
no
specific
area
ceded,
what
ceded
is
what
is
not
allotted.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
that.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
after
the
property
was
ceded
the
government
sold
that
land
under
the--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
only
in
the
exact
same
sense
that
in--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
but
that
--
what
i
was
going
to
say
and
i
will
try
to
get
this,
i
think
i
want
to
do
better
to
bring
it
down
in
historical
perspective,
but
the
indians
were
paid
for
the
land,
how
were
they
paid
for
it?
it
was
put
in
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
to
be
used
for
their
benefit;
in
other
words,
it's
a
bookkeeping
entry
from
one
government
place
to
another.
the
money,
the
indian
agency
was
maintained.
the
money
was
appropriated
by
the
government
as
needed
for
the
indians.
the
land
was
opened
for
homesteading,
but
only
for
homesteading,
not
for
any
purpose.
you
have
exact
same
actual
dynamic
that
occurred
in
the
south
half
of
the
colville
reservation,
which
this
court
held
in
seymour
v.
superintendent,
did
not
abolish
that
reservation.
the
same
dynamic
that
was
done
in
mattz
v.
arnett
as
to
that
reservation
namely,
the
non-indians
got
what
they
wanted,
the
indians
got
what
they
could.
the
non-indians
got
the
right
to
settle
that
land.
the
indians
got
the
money
from
the
settlement
of
that
land,
which
was
small
enough.
the
question
remaining
is
what
happened
to
the
federal
jurisdiction,
what
happened
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribe,
and
i
want
to
approach
that
problem
now.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it's
exactly
so
and
we
quote
in
our
brief,
where
one
of
the
senators
objected
to
the
session
idea,
to
the
fact
that
the
government
would
pay
the
money
immediately,
and
one
of
the
other
senators
explained
to
him
says,
“this
doesn't
mean
anything,
because
this
is
just
a
bookkeeping
transaction
in
the
treasury.
we
get
right
back
the
money
that
we
are
going
to
pay
to
the
indians
as
we
sell
off
the
land”.
now,
in
some
later
acts,
the
government
decided
to
do
it
the
other
way,
to
not
pay
the
indians
at
first,
to
only
pay
the
indians
as
the
land
was
sold,
but
the
practical
effect
of
both
kinds
of
acts
is
identical,
that
the
indians
kept
--
lived
on
the
allotted
land.
the
un-allotted
land
was
opened
up
for
homesteading
because
it
was
thought
and
this
was
said
to
the
indians
in
the
negotiations,
and
this
court
talked
about
this
in
mattz
versus
arnett.
the
excuse
for
doing
this
kind
of
thing
was
that
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians
to
do
it,
that
it
was
better
for
them
to
live
next
to
a
high
caliber
of
citizen
who
would
be
farming
his
land
and
so
forth.
that's
the
kind
of
language
that
was
used.
that
was
the
same
whether
the
indians
said
that
they
ceded
it
first
or
said
--
or
the
government
acted
as
agent
disposing
off
it
and
by
the
way,
this
language
session
in
the
ash
sheep
case
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief
is
used
in
connection
with
an
arrangement
where
the
government
only
acted
purely
as
agent,
where
they
simply
whenever
someone
wanted
a
piece
of
the
land,
it
would
sell
it
to
them
and
give
the
money
to
the
indians.
in
other
words,
cede
was
used,
but
there
obviously
was
no
technical
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
of
the
state?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
none,
none.
the
session
of
the
land
or
the
selling
in
fee
sample
of
land
inside
an
indian
reservation
saying
as
in
the
reservation
match
--
in
seymour
versus
superintendent,
south
half
of
the
colville,
that
then
is
land
is
owned
by
a
non-indian
inside
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
clearly.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
states
trespass
law
would
clearly
apply
to
non-indians,
but
that
would
be,
that
the
extent
that
it's
applied
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
don't
think
he
could
keep
an
indian
from
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it
seems
to
me
that
inside
an
indian
reservation
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
clearly
yes.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
what
i
am
saying
is,
that
in
a
transaction
between
an
indian
and
a
non-indian
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
it
applies
to
that
land
as
to
non-indians,
but
not
as
to
indians.
the
state's
criminal
law
does
not
apply
to
indians
inside
an
indian
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
that's
correct,
that
would
be
under
federal
law
or
under
tribal
law
if
it's
a
matter
of
effecting
an
indian
inside
indian
reservation.
now,
the
general
allotment
act
let
a
lot
of
questions
unresolved.
the
early
questions
that
were
unresolved
was
whether
a
reservation
existed
at
all
after
there
had
been
allotments
and
whether
even
alloted
land
was
indian
land
under
federal
jurisdiction
and
the
court
first
addressed
that
question
in
1909
in
us
v
celestine
in
which
it
held
that
even
though
land
had
been
alloted
to
an
indian
and
patented
to
the
indian,
that
the
land
remained
inside
the
indian
reservation
that
no
land
was
removed
from
an
indian
reservation
until
it's
specifically
removed
by
congress
from
the
reservation.
that
proposition
was
extended
in
1916
in
united
states
versus
nice,
which
held
that
the
tribal
relations
of
the
indians
continues,
and
that
federal
liquor
laws
applying
to
indians
--
would
apply
to
indians
anywhere
within
the
reservation.
but
the
important
thing
was
this,
that
the
states
were
claiming
just
as
the
state
claims
here
that
opening
a
reservation
and
allotting
lands
to
indians
meant
that
state
jurisdiction,
that
federal
jurisdiction
and
tribal
jurisdiction
would
only
apply
on
the
allotted
lands.
and
this
creates
several
problems,
one
is
the
obvious
one
of
having
check
plat
books
to
see
whose
jurisdiction
applies
where.
the
other
one
is
even
a
bit
more
complicated,
these
red
dots
move
around.
the
tribe
buys
new
land,
the
land
can
be
consolidated,
under
recent
act
of
congress,
this
tribe
has
an
active
program
of
purchasing
new
land
which
congress
described
as
within
the
reservation,
thereby
again
recognizing
that
the
reservation
still
existed.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
think
there
has.
what
has
really
occurred
is
that
there's
been
no
law
and
order
on
a
lot
of
indian
reservations,
and
part
of
a
problem
has
been
that
the
federal
government
hasn't
done
its
job,
state
hasn't
done
their
job,
and
the
tribes
have
been
too
weak
to
do
anything.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
state's
responsibility
in
an
indian
reservation
is
as
to
non-indians
to
maintain
law
and
order
in
matters
between
non-indians.
the
federal
government
in
the
tribe
have
the
responsibility
of
maintaining
law
and
order,
in
matters
that
affect
indians.
and
neither
one
of
them
should
have
to
look
at
plat
book
to
do
it.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
person
is
an
indian
or
non-indian.
that's
difficult
enough
problem
without
having
to
figure
out
whether
the
policemen
can
go
on
this
piece
of
ground
or
that
piece
of
ground.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
and
when
that
happens,
that's
federal
jurisdiction
under
18
usc
1151
and
it
makes
a
good
deal
of
sense
that
federal--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
it's
on
a
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
it's
off
reservation
it
would
not
--
that's
right
the
state
jurisdiction.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
excuse
me
that's
inaccurate.
if
it's
not
on
indian
country,
it
would
be
state
jurisdiction,
and
it
could
be
indian
country
all
for
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct,
that
within
an
indian
reservation,
in
a
matter
affecting
indians,
the
original
jurisdiction,
the
root
of
the
jurisdiction
was
tribal
jurisdiction.
but,
federal
government
through
numerous
statutes
has
preempted
great
parts
of
that
jurisdiction,
and
for
all
major
crimes
for
instance,
there
is
federal
jurisdiction,
but
in
a
civil
dispute
between
an
indian
and
a
non-indian
on
an
indian
reservation
it's
tribal
jurisdiction.
that's
williams
versus
lee.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that
is
true
in
indian
country
but
if
you
--
indian
country's
any
land
inside
the
reservation,
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
this
reservation
had
been
abolished
by
the
1891
act,
which
i
think
would
be
a
very
restrictive
and
artificial
interpretation
of
what
court
has
done
and
that's
in
seymour
versus
superintendent,
and
i
think
would
also
undercut
18
usc
1151
seriously
at
least
for
this
reservation.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
if
the
court
should
hold
that,
then
each
one
of
these
red
spots
is
a
little
island
of
federal
and
tribal
jurisdiction,
and
we
are
not
in
a
time
now,
when
these
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
way
it's
been
is
that
everyone
has
ignored
both
the
indian,
and
federal
rights
there,
and
i
don't
want
to
testify.
but,
i
don't
think
the
court
should
assume,
that
the
situation
has
been
good.
and
that
you
can
assume
that
because
we
haven't
faced
this
issue
before,
that
it's
perfectly
alright
to
leave
it
another
50
years.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct,
it
would
be
a
federal
question
or
as
in
any
other
indian
reservation,
and
that
wherever
it
occurred,
and
this
is
something
that
congress
has
decided
as
a
proper
way
for
the
federal
government
to
exercise
its--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes
and
whether
this
one
is
or
not
it
will
be
the
same
situation
you
are
describing
in
other
reservations
of
the
state,
clearly
are
reservations.
we
are
speaking
of
proposition
that
this
we
call
a
reservation,
where
a
major
tribe
lives
and
where
there's
major
number
of
indians
retreated
like
the
other
indian
reservations
in
the
state.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct,
but
we
are
not
trying
to
subject
to
the
non-indians
to
federal
or
indian
jurisdiction
except
to
extent
needed
to
fulfill
the
trust
response
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that's
right.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
haven't
seen
it,
i
have
heard
that,
that's
so.
i
suspect
that
it
goes
beyond
the
authority
that
the
tribe
has
--?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
the
mcbratney
case
and
the
draper
case
and
criminal
matters.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
suppose
i
just
have
to
answer
that
this
has
been
at
least
tacit
holding
of
this
court
and
our
assumption
of
the
court
in
number
of
cases,
i
refer
you
to
cake
and
eagen
where
justice
frankfurter
tried
to
lay
out
the
limits
on
tribal
jurisdiction.
and
it's
never
been
faced
directly
in
the
last
10
years
perhaps
by
this
court
but
is
has
been
faced
before.
my
time
is
up,
and
i
am
feeling
bad
about
taking
all
the
time
of
my
partner.
