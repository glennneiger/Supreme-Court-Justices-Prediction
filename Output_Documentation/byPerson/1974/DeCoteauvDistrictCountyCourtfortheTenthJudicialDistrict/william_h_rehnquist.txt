mr.
hirsch,
does
the
record
indicate
the
number
of
square
miles
that
are
involved
in
this
claim
reservation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
indicate
the
number
of
the
indians
living
in
the
area
now
or
the
number
of
non-indians
living
in
the
area
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
find,
would
you,
would
you--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
roughly
a
150
sq.
miles?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
under
williams
against
lee,
certainly,
the
indian
authorities
would
have
a
great
deal
of
authority
over
non-indians
within
the
reservation
area,
wouldn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
said
he
couldn't
sue
in
the
state
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
this
be
true
here
too
that
from
now
on,
a
non-indian
couldn't
sue
in
the
south
dakota
district
court
if
he
lived
within
this
reservation
area?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
reservation,
it
covers
parts
of
five
different
counties
in
south
dakota.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
any
difference
than
the
williams
against
lee.
i
mean
was
there
a
specific
act
of
congress
in
williams
against
lee
that
gave
the
navajos,
the
authority
to
regulate
non-indians
under
reservation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
does
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question
there
depend
in
any
respect
on
whether
or
not
this
is
an
indian
reservation
or
whether
it
was
all
ceded?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
civil
as
well
as
criminal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
cake
and
eagen?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
civil
dispute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
civil
dispute
under
williams
against
lee,
isn't
a
federal
question?
it's
a
question
for
the
tribal
court,
if
it's
under
reservation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
we
know
that
the
tribe
doesn't
have
authority
to
reach
non-indians?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mcbratney
says
is
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
try
a
white
man
for
a
crime
that
took
place
on
an
indian
reservation.
it
didn't
say
that
tribe
couldn't
try
it.
