mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
south
dakota.
the
issue
presented
is
whether
the
act
of
march
3,
1891
opening
for
a
non-indian
settlement,
the
un-allotted
and
unreserved
lands
in
the
lake
traverse
reservation,
thereby,
confer
jurisdiction
over
indians
on
the
state
of
south
dakota,
gave
the
state
of
south
dakota
jurisdiction
over
indians.
since
the
state
of
south
dakota
has
never
acquired
jurisdiction
in
indian
country
pursuant
to
either
the
1953
act
of
congress
public
law,
280,
which
was
mentioned
here
earlier
or
under
the
more
recent
indian
civil
rights
act,
the
act
of
april
11,
1968,
the
issue
here
really
is
whether
the
1891
act
in
any
way
changed
the
boundaries
of
the
lake
traverse
reservation,
whether
or
not
the
open
portions
of
the
reservation
are
still
an
indian
country.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
really
rather
simple,
with
regard
to
mrs.
decoteau
and
her
two
children.
in
december
of
1971,
the
state
of
south
dakota
started
dependency
and
neglect
proceedings
against
mrs.
decoteau,
the
aim
of
which
was
to
terminate
her
parental
rights
to
her
two
children
herbert
john
spider
and
robert
lee
feather.
the
state
was
seeking
authority
to
place
those
children
for
adoption.
in
august
of
1972,
the
district
county
court,
before
which
this
dependency
and
neglect
proceeding
was
pending,
issued
a
custody
order
that
continued
a
foster
care
placement
for
herbert
john
spider
and
validated
a
foster
care
placement
that
was
then
in
existence
for
robert
lee
feather.
at
that
time,
a
motion
was
made
to
the
district
county
court
judge
that
the
case
be
dismissed
for
the
sole
reason
that
the
acts
or
many
of
the
acts
where
the
alleged
dependency
and
neglect
occurred,
the
places
where
the
acts
occurred
were
in
the
open
portions
of
the
reservation.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
well,
this
case
never
reached
the
point
of
adoption.
in
fact,
the
argument
on
the
merits
of
whether
or
not
there
was,
in
fact,
a
dependency
or
neglect
situation
had
never
been
completed.
there
was
never
an
adjudication
of
dependency
and
neglect,
it
was
in
the
midst
of
that
proceeding
on
the
merits
that
the
jurisdictional
objection
was
raised.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
well,
it's
pertinent
in
terms
of
whether
we
are
talking
here
about
state
jurisdiction
over
the
indian
mother
and
her
two
children
or
whether
we
are
talking
about
exclusive
tribal
jurisdiction.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
the
record
does
not
show
where
she
was
domiciled.
the
record
shows
that
she
is
an
enrolled
member
of
the
sisseton-wahpeton
sioux
tribe
that
her
two
children
are
enrolled
members
and
that
it
was
stipulated
in
the
circuit
court
habeas
corpus
proceeding
that
50%
of
the
acts
giving
rise
to
the
dependency
and
neglect
proceeding
occurred
on
federal
trust
lands
and
approximately
50%
occurred
on
lands
that
were
open
to
settlement
under
the
1891
act.
but,
i
might
add,
that
that
stipulation
was
made
solely
for
the
purpose
of
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
circuit
court
and
does
not
necessarily
a
statement
by
which
i
would
be
bound
if
we
had
to
proceed
once
again
on
the
merits
in
the
district
county
court.
the
district
county
court
denied
the
motion
and
ms.
decoteau
then
proceeded
by
way
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
district
county
court
--
in
the
circuit
court,
alleging
the
exclusive
ground
of
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
district
county
court
to
proceed
with
the
dependency
and
neglect
proceeding
and
to
issue
orders
regarding
the
custody
of
her
two
children.
the
circuit
court
found
that
the
areas
of
land
that
were
open
to
settlement
by
the
1891
act
were
no
longer
part
of
the
reservation,
were
no
longer
indian
country
and
that
therefore
the
state
district
court
had
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
custody
orders
pertaining
to
these
two
children
and
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
the
dependency
and
neglect
proceeding.
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
the
district
court
is
the
court
of
jurisdiction
in
family
matters.
the
circuit
court
also
has
general
jurisdiction
and
other
types
of
cases.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
i
believe
that
it
is
possible
to
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
circuit
court,
but
the
statutes
also
allow
in
some
instances
for
a
direct
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
but,
we
didn't
choose
to
follow
that
route.
we
started
a
collateral
attack
on
the
district
court
proceeding
by
a
proceeding
in
circuit
court
with
a
habeas
corpus.
so,
we
never
did
finish
the
trial
on
the
merits
of
the
dependency
and
neglect.
that
case,
in
fact,
is
pending
resolution
of
this
jurisdictional
issue.
there
was
state
pending
resolution
of
this
jurisdictional
issue.
the
supreme
court
of
south
dakota
needless
to
say
affirmed
the
circuit
court
and
held
that
the
lands
that
were
open
for
non-indian
settlement
under
the
1891
act,
were
no
longer
part
of
the
reservation.
the
place
to
start,
i
believe,
with
this
case
is
with
the
treaty
that
established
the
lake
traverse
reservation,
that
treaty
is
the
treaty
of
february
19,
1867.
and
in
article
3
of
that
treaty,
the
congress
ratified
an
agreement
with
the
tribe
that
gave
the
tribe
a
very
clearly
defined
reservation
and
it
described
the
reservation
in
the
treaty
as
a
permanent
reservation.
the
reservations
located
in
the
north
east
corner
of
south
dakota
with
a
small
portion
of
it
in
the
south
east
corner
of
the
north
dakota,
it's
triangular
in
shape,
basically.
article
10
of
the
same
1867
treaty,
reserved
to
the
tribal
chiefs
and
headmen,
the
right
to
make
rules
and
regulations
for
the
security
and
safety
of
tribal
members,
the
right
basically
to
tribal
self
government.
there
were
--
from
1867
until
1891
there
were
no
acts
or
any
agreements
with
the
tribe
that
pertained
to
the
boundaries
of
this
reservation.
and
then
in
1891,
after
negotiating
an
agreement
with
the
tribe,
congress
ratified
the
agreement
that
open
for
settlement,
the
surplus
lands
on
the
reservation.
now,
the
surplus
lands
are
the
lands
that
remain
after
allotment
and
after
various
other
reservations
are
made,
for
example,
for
schools,
religious
purposes,
for
the
bia
agency.
it
was
--
it's
not
the
bia
agency
in
those
days,
but
the
equivalent.
after
1891,
it's
agreed
between
the
parties,
i
believe,
that
there
is
no
other
act
that
could
have
reduced
the
lake
traverse
reservation
in
size
or
disestablished
the
open
portions
of
it.
so,
what
we're
talking
about
is,
whether
or
not
the
1891
act
had
that
effect,
we,
of
course,
maintain
that
it
did
not
and
i'd
like
to
start
by
going
into
the
expressed
language
of
the
act.
this
court
in
mattz
against
arnett
at
412
u.s.
has
held
that
the
test
is
whether
--
the
test
for
termination
of
reservation
or
for
disestablishment
of
any
portion
of
it,
is
whether
the
language
of
the
act
expressly
terminates
the
reservation
or
whether
such
termination
can
be
inferred
from
a
clear
legislative
history
or
surrounding
circumstances.
the
only
two
sections
in
the
1891
act
that
are
at
all
pertinent
to
the
issues
here
at
sections
26
and
section
30.
now,
section
26
is,
basically,
a
straightforward
verbatim
transcription
or
rendition
of
the
agreement
that
was
reached
with
the
tribe
in
1889.
one
of
the
--
article
1
of
that
agreement,
which
is
repeated
in
section
26
of
the
act,
says
that
the
tribe
cedes,
sells,
relinquishes
and
conveys
its
title
to
the
surplus
lands,
to
the
united
states.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
it
is,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
we
have
to
understand
what
the
rest
of
that
section
says
and
read
that
in
context
and
i'm
going
to
do
that
in
a
second.
and
i
think
we'll
see
that
the
language
is
much
less
strong
than
it
would
on
the
face
appear.
section
30
of
the
act,
which
is
the
only
other
act
affecting
the
issues
here,
says
that
the
lands
that
are
ceded
and
sold
and
relinquished
and
conveyed
shall
be
opened
for
settlement
under
the
homestead
and
townsite
laws
of
the
united
states,
except
for
land
section
16
and
36,
which
are
reserved
for
school
purposes
and
made
subject
to
the
laws
of
the
state
wherein
located.
now,
the
important
thing
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
blackmun
about
section
26
and
the
session
language
is
that
in
section
26,
the
section
recites
section
5
of
the
general
allotment
act
and
it
says
that
this
entire
agreement
is
entered
into
under
the
general
allotment
act
and
this
court
in
mattz
v.
arnett
gave
a
very,
very
careful
analysis
of
the
general
allotment
act
and
concluded
at
412
u.s.
page
496
that
--
and
i'm
quoting
that
the
general
allotment
act
permitted
the
president
to
make
allotments
of
reservation
lands
to
resident
indians
and
with
tribal
consent,
to
sell
surplus
lands.
its
policy
was
to
continue
the
reservation
system
and
the
trust
status
of
indian
lands,
but
to
allot
tracks
to
individual
indians
for
agriculture
and
grazing.
when
all
the
way--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
i'm
reading
form
the
mattz
decision--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
--at
page
496.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
from
the
actual
decision
of
the
court.
i'm
not
sure
whether
i
have
that
in
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
i'm
reading
the
mattz
decision
of
this
court--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
--a
quote
from
the
mattz
decision.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
no,
i'm
not.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
the
court
said
that
when
all
the
lands
had
been
alloted
and
the
trust
expired,
the
reservation
could
then
be
abolished.
now,
with
the
lake
traverse
reservation,
the
trust
has
not
expired,
in
fact,
by
two
executive
orders
of
the
president,
one
in
1914
and
one
in
1924,
the
trust
period
within
the
boundaries
of
the
lake
traverse
reservation
was
expressly
extended
and
it's
been
extended
until
right
at
this
very
time.
so,
the
fact
that
this
is
a
special
kind
of
session,
it's
not
comparable
to
what
might
be
referred
to
as
an
absolute
session
where
the
tribe
is
very,
very
clearly
giving
up
certain
lands
forever.
this
is
a
session
under
the
general
allotment
act
and
that's
a
very
special
kind
of
session.
in
fact,
in
seymour
against
superintendent,
which
affects
the
south-half
of
the
colville
reservation.
the
language
in
the
1906
colville
act,
that
this
court
interpreted
in
that
case,
said
that
the
lands
would
be
sold
and
disposed
and
this
court
found
that
because
it
was
an
agreement
that
was
reached
under
the
--
or
rather
it
wasn't
an
agreement
in
that
case,
but
the
fact
that
the
lands
were
to
be
sold
and
disposed
under
the
general
allotment
act,
placed
that
in
a
different
category.
the
same
situation
existed
in
mattz,
where
congress
had
an
1892
act
that
disposed
off
certain
lands
within
the
hoopa
valley
or
klamath
river
reservation
under
the
general
allotment
act.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
the
record
of
the
case
itself,
i
don't
believe
does
unless
exhibit
number
1
might
refer
to
it.
exhibit
number
1
is
a
1936
map
of
the
--
an
official
map
of
the
department
of
the
interior
that
shows
--
and
it's
the
map
that's
in
use
today
by
the
department
of
the
interior,
it
shows
the
reservation
and
with
an
identical
description
to
a
reservation
that
was
established
in
1867.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
the
legend
of
that
map
contains
an
acreage
total.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
no,
it's
not.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
right,
that
map
is
a
map
of
the
united
states.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
and
imprinted
on
the
map
are
the
indian
land
areas.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
the
exhibit
number
1
is
a
map
only
of
the
triangular
section,
known
as
the
lake
traverse
reservation
and
that's
a
map
that
the
bia
uses
today.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
no,
it
doesn't.
i
know
the
information.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
yeah,
the
reservation
contains
918,000
acres
approximately,
it's
918,300.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
that's
right,
that's
right.
and
the
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
it's
a
120
miles
from
north
to
south
and
it's
from
--
at
the
widest
point
from
east
to
west,
it's
about
40
miles,
i
believe.
the
indian
population
on
the
reservation
today
is
approximately
3300
tribal
members
living
on
or
adjacent
to
the
reservation.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
of
the
reservation
area,
indian
and
non-indian,
it's
approximately
30,000.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
--
a
little
less.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
no,
not
at
all.
this
case
only
raises
the
issue
of
the
tribe's
right
to
have
jurisdiction
over
its
own
membership.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
that's
correct.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
that's
right.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
the
tribe's
authority
would
extend
to
all
the
indians
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
if
the
reservation
had
not
been
disturbed
in
anyway.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
well--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
tribe
has
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
on--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
let's
say,
generally,
an
indian
country,
is
an
issue
that
is
presently
being
litigated
in
several
courts
and
is
not
really
clear.
it's
clear
but
the
tribe
has
certain
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
for
certain
circumstances.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
what
we
are
maintaining
here
is
that
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
i
don't
believe
it
did,
i
don't
believe
it
did.
the
tribe's
authority
was
given
to
it
by
the
1867
treaty
and
i
don't
think
that
the
1891
act
in
anyway
changed
the
1867
treaty.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
williams
against
lee
was
a
case,
as
i
recall,
where
a
non-indian
was
suing
an
indian
for
recovery
of
money
that
was
owed
for
purchases
at
a
store
on
the
navajo
reservation.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
they
said
he
couldn't
sue
in
the
state
court
--
because
there
was
an
indian
defendant
in
the
case.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
if
non-indians
live
within
the
reservation
and
they
have
a
civil
action
of
the
nature
as
was
dealt
with
by
this
court
in
williams
against
lee
yes,
and
they
would
have
to
sue
in
the
tribal
court
and
there
is
a
tribal
court
that
has
been
exercising
that
jurisdiction
since
august
of
1972.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
that's
correct.
and
it
also
has
a
little
scrip
in
north
dakota.
the
section
26
of
the
1891
act
says
that,
the
reservation
or
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
no,
i
am
not
saying
that
at
all,
i
am
saying
that
it's
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
that
on
the
ceded
lands,
it's
definitely
clear,
in
terms
of
our
position
here
today,
it's
definitely
clear,
that
the
tribe
has
complete
civil
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
when
an
indian
is
a
defendant
in
a
civil
action
and
perhaps
even
when
a
non-indian
is
a
defendant
in
a
civil
action,
what
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
but
not
necessarily
to
the
all
inclusive
extent
to
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
perhaps
getting
to,
and
that
is
that
where
the
action
is
between
two
non-indians
then
the
tribe's
jurisdiction
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
the
state's--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
if
he
is
a
non-indian
the
state
law
applies
to
him
on
the
reservation.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
the
only
way
in
which
the
tribe
holds
the
reservation
is
to
have
jurisdiction
over
its
own
membership
on
the
reservation
and
to
have
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
where
the
actions
of
non-indians
affect
essential
tribal
relations.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
williams
against
lee.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
i
said
that's
what
this
court
said
in
williams
against
lee.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
a
non-indian
plaintiff
was
suing
an
indian
defendant,
that's
correct.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
that's
right,
they
had
to
go
to
tribal
court.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
and
i
maintain
the
same
situation
would
exist
here,
if
that
situation
occurred
on
this
reservation,
on
the
ceded
land.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
no,
it's
not.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
no
it's
not.
now,
the
thing
is
that
for
the
tribe
to
acquire
jurisdiction
over
non-indians,
there
would
have
to
be
an
active
congress
that
conferred
that
jurisdiction
on
the
tribe.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
the
treaty
that
established
this
reservation,
specifically
says
in
article
x,
that
the
chiefs
and
the
headman
of
the
tribe
can
make
rules
and
regulations
for
the
governance
of
its
own
membership,
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
now,
how
far
that
extends
is
an
issue
that
is
perhaps
an
open
issue.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
no,
the
situation
there
is
that
there
was
an
indian
defendant
and
the
law
as
it's
come
down,
federal
indian
law
does
not
give
a
tribe
jurisdiction
in
a
case
where
both
parties
are
non-indians,
but
where
one
of
the
parties
is
an
indian,
then
you
have
a
different
situation.
and
that
that's
the
essence
of
the
holdings
of
this
court.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
well,
you
have
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
okay.
well,
in
williams
against
lee,
that's
one
case
that
says
that
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
that
the
state
does
not
have
jurisdiction
because
there
was
an
indian
defendant.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
in
the
cases
of
draper
and
mcbratney,
there
were
criminal
cases
where
non-indians
were
involved
and
the
area
of
criminal
jurisdiction
is
defined
by
18
u.s.c.
1151
and
that's
the
case
that
you
have
next
in
feather,
where
the
major
crimes
act
applies
to
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
that's
right.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
for
a
state
to
get
jurisdiction,
be
it
civil
or
criminal,
over
indians
on
an
indian
reservation
--
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
a
state
has
jurisdiction
over
all
the
people
within
the
state
except
as
congress
otherwise
states.
and
with
regard
to
indians
congress
has
otherwise
stated.
this
particular
case
only
though
involves
the
issue
of
the
tribe's
right
to
control
its
own
people,
to
make
rules
and
regulations
for
its
own
people.
mr.
bertram
e.
hirsch
well,
to
be
honest,
i
am
not
--
this
is
a
very
developing
area
of
law
and
i
am
not
exactly
sure
in
what
direction
it’s
going
to
go
in
the
next
few
years.
there
is
a
case
pending
in
the
ninth
circuit
now
that
raises
these
issues
and
maybe
it
will
reach
this
court,
i
don't
know.
this
area
of
law
has
really
not
been
litigated,
and
it's
first
coming
before
now.
well,
with
regard
to
this
1891
act,
i
think
that
it's
definitely
clear
that
it
did
not
reduce
the
size
of
this
reservation
so
as
to
take
away
from
the
tribe
its
jurisdiction
over
its
own
people.
congress
has
passed
three
acts
in
recent
years
that
continue
to
recognize
the
boundaries
of
this
reservation.
in
1972
there
was
a
claims
distribution
award
act,
and
that
act
in
the
legislative
history
specifically
refers
to
the
sisseton-wahpeton
and
sioux
tribe
of
the
lake
traverse
reservation
and
the
act
gave
one
million
dollars
in
a
lump
sum
to
the
tribe
and
the
rest
was
distributed
per
capita.
in
1974,
there
were
two
acts
that
were
passed.
one
of
which
restored
the
tribal
ownership
approximately
90
acres
of
land
that
had
been
in
federal
ownership.
this
court
in
mattz
thought
that
it
was
significant
that
a
1958
act
had
restored
federal
ownership
to
tribal
ownership
certain
lands
within
the
klamath
river
reservation.
in
1974
also,
there
was
an
act
that
allowed
the
tribe
to
consolidate
its
land
holdings
within
the
reservation,
and
if
you
look
at
the
--
if
you
look
at
the
map
of
the
reservation
that
the
solicitor
general
attached
to
his
brief,
you
can
see
that
the
tribal
land
holdings
are
scattered
all
across
the
reservation.
and
if
in
fact,
the
tribe
has
been
given
authority
by
congress,
which
it
has
been
this
year,
to
consolidate
its
land
holdings
if
it
wanted
to
consolidate
the
land
holdings
in
the
southern
tip
of
the
reservation
with
those
to
the
north,
it
would
have
to
buy
a
considerable
portion
of
land.
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
these
acts
which
refer
to
the
reservation
as
a
v-shaped
reservation
located
in
the
north-east
in
corner
of
south
dakota
and
the
south-east
in
corner
of
north
dakota.
it's
clear
that
congress
in
1974
in
passing
these
laws
thought
that
the
reservation
continued
to
exist
in
the
way
it
was
established
in
1867.
more
than
that
in
1892
and
consistently
from
that
time
on
every
annual
report
of
the
commissioner
of
indian
affairs
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
have
recognized
the
reservation
as
undiminished.
the
proclamation
of
the
president
opening
the
reservation
did
the
same,
talked
about
lands
embraced
within
the
reservation
and
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
1895
in
an
opinion
said
that,
he
referred
to
ceded
lands
lying
within
the
reservation
boundaries,
that's
the
decision
of
edward
paront(ph).
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
