mr.
brice
m.
clagett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
before
the
court
this
afternoon
is
related
to
with
a
great
deal
broader
than
the
question
you
heard
this
morning.
the
question
this
afternoon
is
whether
it
is
the
plaintiff,
the
united
states
or
the
12
defendant
states
which
own
the
natural
resources
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
in
the
atlantic
ocean
beyond
internal
waters,
beyond
territorial
waters.
the
case
presents
three
issues.
first,
do
these
courts
california
and
subsequent
opinions
require
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff?
only
without
regard
to
the
massive
evidence
produced
at
the
trial.
second,
assuming
as
we
deny
that
continental
shelf
rights
first
came
into
existence
by
virtue
of
the
truman
proclamation
in
1945,
did
those
rights
arise
in
favor
of
the
states
or
of
the
federal
government.
third,
if
the
court
holds
in
favor
of
the
states
that
federal
ownership
is
not
required
by
california,
but
rejects
the
states'
argument
that
any
continental
shelf
rights
arising
in
1945
would
have
arisen
in
their
favor
then
the
question
becomes
whether
the
states
have
made
out
their
claim
to
the
resources
on
the
basis
of
a
historic
title.
the
first
question
then
is
whether
the
california
line
of
cases
compels
a
decision
in
favor
or
the
plaintiff.
we
think
the
very
fact
that
this
court
referred
the
case
to
a
special
master
in
the
face
of
the
united
states'
argument
that
the
result
was
pre-ordained
by
california
strongly
indicated
that
this
court
wish
the
issues
to
be
examined
on
their
merits
and
not
decided
by
an
automatic
application
of
precedent.
nonetheless,
the
master
believe
himself
obligated
to
grant
the
plaintiff's
original
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings
by
applying
what
he
believe
to
be
the
california
doctrines.
there
are
a
number
of
important
distinctions
between
this
case
and
california
and
we
submit
california
stands
for
somewhat
less
than
as
usually
alleged.
the
contention
which
the
court
there
decline
to
accept
was
that
the
original
atlantic
states
had
held
prior
to
the
revolution
a
uniform
three-mile
belt
of
territorial
waters,
a
contention
which
is
very
different
from
the
contention
the
states
made
here.
in
california,
the
court
looked
into
that
contention
that
there
was
a
three-mile
belt
prior
to
the
revolution
and
found
quite
correctly
that
no
one
had
ever
heard
or
a
three-mile
limit
or
a
three-mile
belt
prior
to
the
revolution.
since
that
was
the
only
contention
that
had
been
made
to
the
court,
the
court
quite
naturally
held
that
the
contention
had
not
been
established
and
that
california
has
not
proved
its
case.
even
as
to
that
contention,
the
court
said
only
that
on
the
basis
of
the
materials
that
had
then
been
furnished,
it
could
not
say
that
pre-independence,
colonial
ownership
of
a
three-mile
belt
had
been
made
out.
it's
notable
also
that
massachusetts
one
of
the
defendant
states
before
you
today
suddenly
you
have
to
intervene
in
the
california
case.
the
court
denied
intervention.
that
denial
was
presumably
on
the
ground
which
the
plaintiff
both
there
and
here
had
urged
to
the
court
that
“massachusetts
cannot
be
affected
by
any
judgment
which
may
be
entered
in
this
suit.”
it's
unclear
perhaps,
also
whether
the
california
court
believed
that
the
federal
interest
in
the
shelf
which
it
described
would
prevail
even
over
an
established
state
historic
title
or
whether
the
court
merely
believed
that
those
federal
interest
would
established
federal
ownership
in
the
absence
of
a
historic
title
on
behalf
of
anyone.
the
court
never
reached
the
former
question
whether
the
federal
interest
would
defeat
an
established
state
title
because
it
held
that
the
evidence
put
forward
had
not
established
any
state
title.
and
finally,
as
i
will
argue
in
a
few
moments
in
detail,
developments
have
occurred
since
the
california
decision
both
congressional
action
and
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
which
decisively
undercut
the
california
rational.
in
this
circumstances,
it
is
wholly
understandable
i
think
that
when
this
case
was
brought,
raising
for
the
first
time
directly
with
the
appropriate
parties
before
you
whether
the
atlantic
coastal
states
on
their
continental
shelf
beyond
the
three-mile
limit
or
not.
the
court
would
wish
to
consider
the
issue
as
a
new
matter
and
on
the
basis
of
a
complete
record.
that
record
has
now
been
made.
it's
idle
perhaps
to
debate
where
there
some
or
much
or
most
of
the
material
now
of
record
was
before
you
in
california.
i
can
assure
the
court
with
confidence
that
a
comparison
of
the
record
in
the
two
cases
will
leave
no
doubt
that
the
present
record
is
immensely
superior.
not
only
in
the
volume,
the
scope,
the
completeness
of
the
material
of
the
primary
materials
but
in
the
depth
and
sophistication
with
which
the
bare
bones
of
those
primary
materials
have
been
analyzed.
in
the
previous
cases,
only
those
bare
bones
were
before
you
and
none
of
those
cases
was
there
any
reference
to
a
master.
there
were
no
trials.
the
cases
were
decided
on
the
bare
pleadings.
our
record
aside
from
a
great
wealth
of
documentary
evidence
contains
analysis
by
10
expert
witnesses
and
extensive
cross-examination
of
them.
the
plaintiff
appears
to
think
less
of
its
expert
witnesses
than
we
do
of
ours
when
it
argues
that
little
of
significance
is
now
before
the
court
that
was
not
before
it
in
california.
one
would
think
given
the
extreme
complexity
of
the
questions
of
history,
legal
history,
phonology,
international
law,
international
legal
history
and
related
subjects.
one
would
expect
the
plaintiff
to
believe
as
we
do
that
analysis
by
qualified
scholars
in
the
relevant
fields
would
be
of
great
assistance
if
not
essential
to
the
court.
one
reason
why
the
plaintiff
apparently
thinks
otherwise
is
that
its
own
expert
witnesses
ended
up
agreeing
with
the
defendant's
position
on
many
if
not
most
of
the
relevant
issues
of
fact
and
law.
i
shall
be
referring
to
these
concessions
with
some
frequency
during
the
course
of
this
argument
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
all
the
record
that
is
before
you
today,
both
the
original,
unprinted
record
of
which
that
is
but
part
and
the
printed
record
perhaps
the
most
important
part
is
the
last
15
or
20
pages
of
volume
1
of
our
appendix
from
about
500
--
page
528
through
to
the
end
558,
30
pages
and
i
would
urge
you
to
read
those
pages
over
and
over
again
because
they
contain
the
most
crucial
of
the
many
concessions
made
by
plaintiff's
witnesses
in
the
course
of
cross-examination.
beyond
any
comparison
of
records,
this
would
seem
in
every
respect
a
case
where
the
court
would
deem
it
appropriate
to
take
a
fresh
look
unfettered
even
by
any
presumption
arising
from
its
past
decisions.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett

mr.
justice
stewart
through

it's
the
last
30
pages
of
volume
1
of
the
appendix.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
mr.
cavignon,
yes,
sir.
stare
decisis
is
readily
overcome
in
matters
of
transcendent
public
and
constitutional
imports
which
this
case
surely
is.
california
itself
overruled
many
previous
decisions
of
this
court
which
it
affirms
state
ownership
of
land
under
navigable
waters
whether
inland
or
not.
let
us
then
consider
the
issue
on
it
s
merits.
the
states
claim
they
have
an
historic
title
to
these
continental
shelf
resources.
the
plaintiff
while
contesting
our
version
of
the
history
primarily
argues
that
it
is
all
irrelevant.
the
continental
shelf
plaintiff
says
it
belongs
to
the
federal
government
as
a
corollary
of
its
external
sovereignty
thus
plaintiff
claims
even
if
the
states
would
otherwise
have
perfect
title
to
the
continental
shelf,
it
has
been
stripped
from
them
by
the
constitution's
vesting
of
external
sovereignty
in
the
federal
government.
that
phrase
external
sovereignty
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
the
constitution,
it's
the
jargon
that's
generally
used
to
indicate
the
fact
that
it
is
the
federal
government
and
not
the
states
individually
which
is
an
international
person,
a
nation
recognized
by
the
world
community
as
an
equal
member
of
the
family
of
nations
with
rights
and
responsibilities
under
international
law.
but
it
in
no
way
follows
from
the
external
sovereignty
we
submit
that
the
united
states
as
distinct
from
the
individual
states
owns
or
must
own
these
continental
shelf
resources.
international
law
has
nothing
to
say
one
or
the
other
about
the
ownership
of
continental
shelf
resources
as
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government
or
about
similar
issues
in
any
other
federal
system.
as
an
international
matter,
it's
the
united
states
not
the
states
as
distinguished
--
the
united
states
is
distinguished
from
other
nations
which
owns
these
resources.
but
it's
only
compatible
with
international
law
and
with
the
plaintiff's
status
his
external
sovereign
for
the
states
to
own
these
resources
as
a
matter
of
our
own
law.
i
won't
dwell
on
this
point
because
plaintiff's
international
law
witness
professor
henkin
conceded
it
and
i
don't
understand
the
plaintiff
to
be
seriously
contesting
it.
thought
there's
a
passage
on
page
55
of
the
plaintiff's
brief
which
suggest
that
possibly
it
may
still
be
contesting
it.
there's
nothing
in
the
nature
of
external
sovereignty
which
requires
that
in
a
federal
system
of
government,
that
entity
which
possesses
external
sovereignty
be
also
the
same
entity
which
owns
continental
shelf
resources.
the
constitutional
law
of
the
federal
system
may
determine
that
question
anyway
it
wishes.
this
court
expressly
and
clearly
so
held
in
the
second
louisiana
case
in
1960.
there's
no
magic
in
the
fact
that
these
resources
right
outside
our
national
boundaries
which
means
that
the
external
sovereign
has
to
own
them.
plaintiff's
argument
that
there
is,
i've
never
been
able
to
understand
except
as
a
sort
of
superficial
play
of
words
on
the
word
externally,
it's
outside
therefore
of
the
federal
government
must
know
it.
there's
nothing
to
it.
one
illustration
that
was
used
at
the
trial
to
expose
this
was
a
hypothetical
parcel
of
land
in
virginia
--
excuse
me,
a
hypothetical
parcel
of
land
in
england
which
virginia
owned
for
the
revolution,
the
colony
of
virginia.
plaintiff's
witness
conceded
these
concessions
of
page
543
of
the
appendix
that
virginia
would
have
retained
that
land
once
the
federal
government
became
the
external
sovereign
whenever
that
was.
no
magic
would
have
cause
title
to
passed.
the
situation
is
no
different
in
any
respect
with
regard
to
the
continental
shelf
rights
at
issue
here
we
submit.
when
plaintiff's
argument
is
analyzed
it
appears
that
what
plaintiff
is
really
claiming
is
not
plaintiff's
bare
status
is
external
sovereign
gives
at
this
resource.
plaintiff's
real
argument
is
that
certain
powers
vested
in
the
federal
government
by
the
constitution
the
foreign
affairs
power,
the
defense
power,
the
power
of
a
foreign
commerce
cannot
properly
be
conducted
without
federal
ownership
of
the
continental
shelf.
therefore,
plaintiff
argues
by
vesting
those
powers
in
the
federal
government,
the
constitution
necessarily
transferred
ownership
from
the
states
to
the
federal
government
assuming
of
course
that
the
states
had
owned
them
before.
plaintiff
is
rather
cautious
about
making
this
argument
rather
indirect
about
it
for
excellent
reasons
as
i
think
we'll
see
in
a
moment.
but
if
that
is
not
plaintiff's
argument,
if
that
is
not
the
guts
and
gist
of
it,
then
i
am
wholly
at
a
lost
to
understand
what
plaintiff's
argument
is.
when
the
argument
is
submitted
to
scrutiny,
it
is
seemed
to
be
mirage
wholly
the
void
of
substance.
plainly,
the
federal
government's
foreign
affairs
defense
on
foreign
commerce
powers
are
both
broad
and
paramount.
they
override
any
competing
state
interests
but
these
powers
no
more
require
federal
ownership
of
the
continental
shelf
resources
at
issue
here
than
they
require
federal
ownership
of
all
the
land
or
all
the
minerals
in
the
land
territory
of
the
united
states.
where
the
federal
government
also
has
both
those
and
other
broad
and
paramount
constitutional
powers.
let
us
take
the
foreign
affairs
power
first.
the
plaintiff
has
failed
to
give
any
illustration
whatever
of
any
way
in
which
that
power
could
possibly
be
hindered
or
embarrassed
by
state
ownership
of
continental
shelf
resources.
no
one
questions
that
the
federal
government
has
the
power
by
treaty
with
other
nations
or
otherwise
to
define
the
outer
extent
of
the
continental
shelf
which
is
under
our
exclusive
national
ownership.
if
there
were
previous
state
rights
out
there,
the
federal
government
could
cut
them
off
by
treaty
or
otherwise
and
the
pursuit
of
the
foreign
affairs
power.
by
the
continental
shelf
convention
of
1958
in
agreement
with
other
nations
the
federal
government
did
precisely
that
no
one
doubts
that
that
was
a
proper
exercise
of
the
foreign
affairs
power.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
unquestionably.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
if
it
took
them
in
the
course
of
a
genuine
foreign
relations
settlement
with
other
nations,
i
would
say
no.
if
it
was
done
in
the
exercise
of
the
foreign
affairs
power,
i
would
analogize
it
to
a
boundary
settlement
which
would
not
require
compensation.
if
the
alleged,
if
the
treaty
were
nothing
but
a
camouflage,
if
what
was
really
being
done
was
that
the
federal
government
wanted
to
cut
those
state
rights
off
for
non-legitimate
foreign
affairs
purposes
then
i
would
say
yes.
similarly,
under
the
doctrine
of
missouri
versus
holland,
the
federal
government
made
by
treaty
accept
international
regulation
of
continental
shelf
activity
for
foreign
policy
ends.
such
regulation
would
bind
the
states
and
would
supersede
any
contrary
state
law.
if
any
state
or
state
license
exportation
of
shelf
resources
interfered
with
the
right
of
free
navigation
over
the
super
adjacent
eaters
which
international
law
establishes
then
the
federal
government
would
have
both
the
duty
under
the
national
law
and
the
right
under
our
own
law
to
stop
that
interference.
since
1953,
the
states
have
admittedly
owned
seabed
resources
out
for
three
miles
and
indeed
out
to
10
miles
in
the
case
of
some
of
the
gulf
states.
no
one
claims
that
state
ownership
and
exploitation
of
these
resources
has
presented
any
international
embarrassment
whatsoever
or
any
foreign
policy
complication
or
problem.
plaintiff's
international
law
witness
professor
henkin
conceded
that
no
such
problems
had
arisen.
that
concession
by
an
oversight,
we
didn't
put
in
our
printed
appendix.
it's
on
page
2647
of
the
transcript.
the
defense
power
likewise
has
nothing
to
do
with
ownership
of
continental
shelf
resources.
the
united
states
can
defend
and
has
defended
the
land
territory
of
the
united
states
without
owning
all
the
land
in
the
country.
why
is
the
continental
shelf
one
with
different?
plaintiff
has
suggested
no
reason.
plaintiff's
bare
assertion
that
that
there
is
a
difference
is
particularly
impossible
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
states
here
are
claiming
only
the
resources
of
the
seabed.
they
make
no
claim
to
the
waters
above.
if
it
be
said
that
the
defense
power
may
require
the
exercise
of
federal
control
over
these
resources.
for
example,
to
ensure
they
are
more
rapid
and
defective
exploitation
in
time
of
national
emergency
or
war,
no
one
can
doubt
that
defense
power
permits
precisely
that
just
as
it
permit
similar
control
over
the
resources
natural
and
human
of
the
entire
country.
no
one
has
ever
proposed
that
the
defense
power
requires
federal
ownership
of
everything
in
the
country.
unchallenged
testimony
before
the
master
described
how
the
federal
government
is
readily
able
to
marshal
and
direct
all
the
resources
of
the
nation
whenever
that
attempts
necessary.
the
same
is
true
of
the
power
over
foreign
commerce.
if
the
federal
government
decides
that
the
energy
crisis
or
some
other
economic
factor
requires
that
continental
shelf
resources
be
developed
at
a
different
pace,
or
in
a
different
manner
from
what
the
states
are
doing.
the
federal
government
plainly
has
the
constitutional
power
to
exercise
all
the
control
necessary
to
achieve
that
end.
i
want
to
emphasize
this
point,
it's
critical
because
of
fears
expressed
in
some
quarters
of
the
states
because
of
environmental
concerns
or
parochial
pressures
of
one
sort
or
another
might
retire
or
impede
continental
shelf
development
to
the
detriment
of
the
national
interest.
as
i
shall
argue
in
a
moment,
the
states
have
important
legitimate
interest
in
what
happens
of
their
shores
which
can
be
implemented
only
through
ownership
of
these
resources.
but
if
the
federal
government
found
and
i
repeat
that
the
national
interest
required
overriding
those
state
concerns
and
developing
shelf
resources
faster
or
differently
than
the
states
are
willing
to
permit.
it
is
beyond
question
that
the
federal
government
could
validly
still
act.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
that
would
depend
on
whether
the
particular
purpose
involved
the
shelf
resources
more
than
it
all
planned.
i
think
there's
no
question
that
if
a
state
owned
the
uranium
on
land,
and
the
state
refused
to
exploit
it
and
the
federal
government
needed
it
for
the
national
defense
or
whatever,
that
of
course
the
federal
government
could
require
a
development
of
that
mine.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
would
say
without
compensation
if
it
were
the
state
that
was
getting
the
revenues
from
it.
in
other
words,
of
course
it
could
be
taken
by
the
eminent
domain
power
but
the
government
short
of
taking
it
could
say
we
will
require
that
it
be
developed.
you
will
get
the
revenues.
you're
getting
more
money
than
you
got
before.
of
course
no
compensation
is
due.
nothing
has
been
taken.
it's
simply
a
regulatory
measure
requiring
a
different
manner
of
development
from
what
the
state
would
have
chosen
on
its
own
in
order
to
accomplish
some
overriding
national
purpose.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
would
submit
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
is
precisely
the
same
form
of
ownership
that
every
acre,
every
building,
every
car,
every
tank,
every
truck
in
the
country
is
subject
to
it.
and
again,
i
cite
the
case
of
the
hypothetical
state-owned
uranium.
this
is
no
different
from
anything
else.
i
think
there's
nothing
whatever
that's
unique
about
it.
the
fundamental
form
then
in
our
submission
in
the
plaintiff's
argument
is
to
assume
that
there
is
something
special
or
unique
about
the
continental
shelf
which
means
contrary
to
the
situation,
everywhere
else
that
the
exercise
of
constitutional
power
there
requires
ownership
and
property.
the
plaintiff
has
steadfastly
declined
to
tell
us
what
that
difference
is
and
in
fact
there
is
none.
as
mr.
justice
reed
said
dissenting
in
the
california
case,
state
ownership
“would
not
interfere
in
any
way
with
the
needs
or
rights
of
the
united
states
in
war
or
peace.”
the
power
of
the
united
states
is
plenary
over
this
undersea
lands
precisely,
as
it
is
over
every
river,
farm,
mine,
and
factory
of
the
united
states.”
justice
frankfurter's
dissenting
opinion
was
precisely
to
the
same
effect
on
that
subject.
an
argument
similar
to
the
plaintiff's
argument
here
was
made
in
united
states
versus
bevans
decided
in
1818.
there
the
federal
government
argued
that
territorial
sovereignty
over
the
waters
of
massachusetts
bay
had
been
transferred
from
massachusetts
to
the
united
states
by
virtue
of
the
federal
constitutional
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
court
in
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
marshall
said
that
it
was
incapable
of
feeling
any
doubt
that
this
argument
was
wholly
spurious.
the
court
made
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
paramount
federal
powers
on
the
one
hand
and
the
residual
jurisdiction
of
the
waters
in
the
state.
the
chief
justice
said
that
subject
to
the
federal
power,
that
jurisdiction
adheres
to
the
territory
as
a
portion
of
sovereignty
not
yet
given
away.
the
holding
in
bevans
was
followed
in
mccready
versus
virginia
and
smith
versus
maryland
and
in
1890
in
manchester
versus
massachusetts.
we
submit
that
this
line
of
cases
is
plainly
correct.
the
chief
justice's
analysis
applies
just
as
much
to
the
foreign
affairs,
the
defense,
and
the
commerce
powers
as
it
does
to
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
all
these
federal
powers
are
paramount
on
properly
invoked
over
every
state
law
right
or
title.
but
every
one
of
those
federal
powers
co-exist
with
and
is
fully
compatible
with
the
existence
and
boundaries
of
state
territory
with
state
property
rights
and
with
the
residual
sovereignty
of
the
states.
that
i
submit
is
what
our
federal
system
is
all
about.
it's
just
as
applicable
to
the
continental
shelf
as
it
is
anywhere
else.
the
constitution
itself,
we
think,
makes
this
abundantly
clear.
article
iv,
section
3,
clause
2
provides
that
nothing
in
the
constitution
shall
be
so
construed
as
to
prejudice.
any
claims
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
particular
state.
the
history
of
this
clause
makes
it
clear
that
the
claims
referred
to
were
claims
to
territory
and
to
property.
the
clause
arose
out
of
the
western
line's
controversy
during
the
revolution
and
confederation
periods
in
which
the
states
which
marked
western
lands
vigorously
sought
to
appropriate
those
of
the
other
states
without
their
consent
for
the
union
as
a
whole.
that
attempt
was
repeatedly
and
unambiguously
rejected.
while
eventually
some
of
the
western
lands
were
voluntarily
ceded
by
the
states,
some
of
them
not
all,
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
the
federal
title
to
those
lands
was
derived
solely
from
those
voluntary
acts
of
the
session,
and
was
subject
to
the
conditions,
the
very
substantial
conditions
in
some
instances
which
the
states
had
articulated
in
the
instruments
of
the
session.
this
was
fully
and
universally
understood
with
reference
to
all
navigable
waters
and
the
land
underlying
them
from
the
beginning
of
the
union
down
to
the
california
decision
in
1945.
every
court
decision,
every
commentator,
every
score,
took
it
as
unquestionable
that
the
states
retained
whatever
territorial
and
property
rights
the
antecedent
colonies
or
the
crown
had
had
before
the
revolution.
over
waters
and
submerged
lands
just
as
over
dry
land,
subject
always
to
the
fed
--
paramount
federal
powers
conferred
by
the
constitution.
the
majority
opinion
of
course
in
california
itself
admitted
if
a
bit
grudgingly
that
this
had
been
the
uniform
prior
understanding
with
respect
to
offshore
waters
and
their
subsoil
just
as
much
as
with
respect
to
land
territory
and
internal
waters.
that
admission
was
well
taken.
if
by
deciding
in
favor
of
the
states
today,
the
court
believes
it
must
overrule
california
and
that
is
by
no
means
necessary
clear.
it
would
then
be
returning
to
a
much
older
and
to
much
sounder
doctrine
reflected
in
pollard's
lessee
versus
hagan,
martin
versus
waddell,
manchester
versus
massachusetts,
united
states
versus
bevans,
smith
versus
maryland,
mccready
versus
virginia,
and
literally,
a
host
of
other
cases.
the
alleged
california
doctrine
is
an
aberration.
we
very
much
hope
a
temporary
one.
the
events
that
occurred
after
the
california
line
of
cases,
confirmed
what
i
have
said
thus
far.
these
events
indeed
fatally
undermine
the
authority
of
california,
if
that
decision
held
that
the
federal
government
owns
continental
shelf
resources
as
coronary
of
external
sovereignty
or
of
the
foreign
affairs
defense
and
commerce
powers.
the
legislation
of
1953,
the
submerged
lands
act
and
the
outer
continental
shelf
act,
restored
to
the
states
the
seabed
resources
under
the
three-mile
belt
which
the
california
decision
had
appeared
to
take
from.
in
the
case
of
the
states
bordering
the
gulf
of
mexico,
of
course,
congress
allowed
the
coastal
states
to
recover
their
resources
out
to
10
miles
if
they
could
prove
historic
boundaries
out
that
far.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
three
leagues.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
three
leagues,
mr.
justice,
its
nine
nautical
miles,
10.5
statute
lines.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
nine
nautical
miles.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i'm
afraid
i've
used
that
as
a
shorthand
and
you're
quite
right
sir,
that
it's
inaccurate.
the
legislative
history
makes
it
abundantly
clear
that
congress
regarded
the
california
decision
as
wholly
wrong
and
that
it
believed
it
was
restoring
to
the
states
rights
they'd
always
had
until
california
appropriated
them
to
the
federal
government.
how
was
such
a
restoration
possible
if
federal
external
sovereignty
or
federal
constitutional
powers
required
federal
ownership?
the
argument
that
it
was
not
possible
based
on
precisely
the
grounds
intermitted
by
the
california
majority
was
pressed
on
congress
for
strenuously.
but
congress
rejected
that
argument.
its
rejection
perhaps
is
not
of
constitutional
significance.
but
it
is
of
course
a
very
great
constitutional
significance
that
this
court
ratified
congress'
view.
in
the
second
round
of
the
gulf
states
litigation,
texas
inferred
a
claim
to
historic
boundaries
out
to
three
leagues.
the
federal
government
argued
there
just
as
it
argues
here
with
equal
vehemence
that
such
boundaries,
such
continental
shelf
ownership
could
not
be
recognized
even
in
spite
of
the
statute
without
doing
violence
to
federal
external
sovereignty
to
the
foreign
affairs
and
defense
powers
and
to
the
three-mile
limit.
this
court
rejected
that
argument
and
accepted
congress'
judgment
that
it
was
perfectly
possible
for
the
states
to
own
continental
shelf
resources
both
within
and
beyond
the
three-mile
limit
without
doing
any
violence
to
federal
powers
or
prerogatives.
the
plaintiff
argues
that
in
the
second
gulf
litigation,
this
court
never
said
it
was
repudiating
the
california
rational
and
indeed
that
there
is
language
in
the
opinions
that
seems
to
reaffirm
california.
that
is
true
but
it
is
equally
true
we
submit
that
the
california
doctrine
cannot
co-exist
with
the
later
doctrine
of
the
second
gulf
litigation.
if
the
federal
government
owns
sub-c
resources
as
a
corollary
of
external
sovereignty
or
a
corollary
of
the
fund
affairs
and
defense
powers
as
california
seem
to
suggest.
then
how
could
this
court
countenance
alienation
of
those
necessary
national
rights
by
act
of
congress.
such
an
alienation
would
be
just
as
invalid
on
the
california
theory
as
if
congress
had
passed
the
law
advocating
the
function
of
ratifying
treaties
for
example
to
a
committee
of
the
state
governors.
further
proof,
of
the
repudiation
of
california
by
subsequent
events,
is
found
in
alabama
versus
texas
decided
in
1954,
the
year
after
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed.
this
court
in
the
brief
per
curiam
opinion
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
submerged
lands
act
by
even
refusing
to
allow
a
complaint
to
be
filed
challenging
it.
the
most
interesting
fact
about
alabama
versus
texas,
i
submit
is
that
justice
black,
the
author
of
the
california
opinion,
vehemently
dissented
on
the
ground
that
the
1953
legislation
did
appear
to
be
inconsistent
with
california's
rational
that
federal
ownership
was
essential
for
federal
external
sovereignty
and
constitutional
powers.
the
legislation
justice
black
declared
and
i
quote
“raise
serious
and
difficult
questions
with
respect
to
the
authority
of
congress
to
relinquish
elements
of
national
sovereignty
over
the
ocean.”
i
submit
that
justice
black
was
wholly
correct
in
perceiving
that
his
california
opinion
and
the
submerged
lands
act
could
not
both
stand.
by
upholding
the
act,
this
court
necessarily
rejected
the
california
rational.
in
view
of
this
history,
we
submit
that
stare
decisis
works
more
in
our
favor
than
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
the
california
doctrine
simply
cannot
co-exist
with
the
rational
and
the
result
of
litigation.
either
california
does
not
require
federal
ownership
of
the
resources
in
question
here.
or
if
it
does,
it
has
been
overruled.
i've
talked
a
great
deal
about
federal
interests
which
supposedly
require
federal
ownership
of
the
continental
shelf.
i
hope
i
have
shown
that
they
require
nothing
of
the
sort.
that
should
be
enough
to
lead
the
court
to
consider
the
states
historic
claims
on
their
merits.
but
in
addition,
the
states
have
constitutional
interests
in
these
resources,
interests
which
unlike
the
federal
interests
require
ownership.
these
state
interests
are
described
skillfully
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
tidelands
committee
of
the
national
association
of
attorneys
general.
i
would
draw
the
court's
attention
also
to
a
document
called
outer
continental
shelf
oils
and
gas
development
and
the
coastal
zone
issued
last
november
by
a
joint
committee
of
congress,
the
national
ocean
policy
study.
we've
enlarge
10
copies
of
this
with
the
court
and
i
see
that
it's
been
distributed.
this
document
is
a
more
comprehensive
indication
than
any
i
could
give
of
the
states
real
and
practical
interests
in
continental
shelf
resources
and
of
the
dilemma
in
which
the
states
will
find
themselves
if
they
are
denied
ownership
of
them.
moreover,
and
this
is
a
point
not
mentioned
in
our
brief
so
i'd
like
to
emphasize
it.
while
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
would
give
it
100%
of
all
the
revenues
to
be
derived
from
continental
shelf
exportation,
the
opposite
is
by
no
means
true
of
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
states.
if
state
ownership
is
recognized,
the
federal
government
will
remain
free
to
tax
the
resources
to
be
extracted
both
by
means
of
income
taxes
on
the
lessees
and
on
by
any
other
type
of
tax
plaintiff
deserves
such
as
for
example
the
excise
tax
on
domestic
and
continental
shelf
production
recently
proposed
by
the
administration.
section
638
of
the
internal
revenue
code
extends
expressly
the
full
federal
taxing
power
to
outer
continental
shelf
resources.
thus,
the
decision
in
favor
of
the
states
here
will
give
the
states
indeed
the
royalties
and
the
bonus
payments
from
leasing.
but
the
federal
government
will
have
its
full
taxing
power
and
could
by
adjustments
of
that
taxing
power
effectuate
virtually
any
apportionment
of
the
total
revenues
of
shelf
exploitation
which
was
found
appropriate.
thus,
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
states
here
and
only
such
a
decision
will
permit
a
reasonable
allocation
of
revenues
between
the
states
and
the
federal
government.
a
decision
for
the
plaintiff,
on
the
other
hand
will
necessary
give
the
plaintiff
100%
and
the
states
nothing.
thus,
only
by
deciding
this
case
in
favor
of
the
states
can
this
court
safeguard
any
of
the
very
real
state
interest
and
concerns
in
the
continental
shelf.
the
federal
government
already
has
its
constitutional
powers
and
its
paramount
control
there
including
the
taxing
power.
if
it
is
given
ownership
as
well,
it
will
have
everything
and
the
states
will
have
nothing.
only
by
recognizing
state
ownership
can
the
legitimate
state
interests
be
protected
and
our
dual
system
of
government
apply
to
this
important
national
resource.
i
have
i
hope
dispose
of
the
argument
that
the
constitution
means
that
the
federal
government
necessarily
owns
these
resources.
i'm
now
almost
ready
to
turn
to
the
historic
title
on
which
the
states
primarily
based
their
claim.
however,
what
i
have
said
so
far
supports
another,
an
independent
basis
for
the
states
claim
to
ownership.
since
the
truman
proclamation
of
1945,
and
the
continental
shelf
convention
of
1958,
no
one
disputes
that
as
a
matter
of
international
law.
every
coastal
nation
owns
its
continental
shelf
resources
as
what
the
world
court
has
called
inherent
or
pertinence
of
its
land
territory.
even
if
these
resources
were
acquired
for
the
first
time
in
1945
as
plaintiff
contends,
they
were
not
acquired
as
an
independent
or
separable
territory
like
the
louisiana
purchase
or
alaska
or
some
such
acquisition.
they
were
acquired
quite
differently
by
what
you
might
call
a
sort
of
legal
accretion.
they
follow
from
and
they
depended
upon
sovereignty
over
the
adjacent
coastline.
no
one
doubts
for
example
that
if
the
united
states
were
to
see
the
portion
of
its
coastline
to
another
country,
the
continental
shelf
adjoining
that
coastline
would
pass
automatically
to
the
new
sovereign
without
any
expressed
reference
in
the
act
of
session.
it
is
a
coronary.
this
is
the
first
time
the
word
coronary
scrapped
up
where
in
our
submission,
it
sound.
the
truman
proclamation
did
not
purport
to
claim
the
shelf
on
behalf
of
the
federal
government
as
against
the
states.
it
carefully
and
explicitly
left
that
question
open.
we
think
that
even
if
the
states
had
had
no
historic
title,
to
the
resources
and
if
property
rights
in
them
spring
up
ex
(inaudible)
for
the
first
time
in
1945
as
plaintiff
contends
under
our
constitutional
system,
they
arose
in
favor
of
the
states
not
of
the
federal
government.
these
rights
as
i've
said
appertain
inherently
to
the
sovereign
of
the
adjacent
coastline.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
who
is
the
relevant
sovereign?
in
the
case
of
this
country,
we
have
of
course
a
divided
sovereignty.
the
federal
government
has
delegated
powers.
the
states
have
the
residuum.
that
residuum
includes
normally
the
ownership
of
public
lands.
and
there
is
no
dispute
whatever
that
in
the
case
of
these
original
atlantic
states
all
public,
ungranted
lands
belong
to
the
state.
if
the
argument
i
made
earlier
is
sound
that
the
delegated
federal
powers
do
not
require
federal
ownership
of
shelf
resources,
then
it
follows
that
the
residual
sovereignty
of
the
states
would
attached
to
them.
thus,
the
dual
sovereignty
of
this
country
would
simply
expand
outwards
to
embrace
this
allegedly
new
appurtenance
when
it
was
required
by
legal
accretion
or
a
change
in
the
law
on
plaintiff's
assumptions.
the
delegated
powers
of
the
federal
government
would
expand
to
embrace
those
resources,
just
as
fully
as
they
embraced
the
nation
itself.
but
the
reserve
powers,
the
residual
sovereignty
of
the
states
would
likewise
and
equally
expand
to
embrace
them
also.
an
ownership
of
ungranted
lands
or
resources
is
plainly
a
part
of
that
residual
sovereignty,
not
a
part
of
the
delegated
federal
powers
which
entail
paramountcy
but
not
dominion.
the
master
never
even
considered
this
argument
because
he
believed
himself
precluded
by
california
from
doing
so.
the
plaintiff
has
not
responded
to
it
in
anyway
except
to
repeat
that
california
in
connotation.
we
urge
the
court
that
this
case
can
and
should
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
defendant
states
on
this
ground
without
any
necessity
for
examining
the
question
of
historic
title
at
all.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
as
a
territory
shall
we
say?
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
as
a
private
owner?
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
i
would
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
would
say
mr.
justice
white
because
these
rights
are
on
appurtenance
not
of
private
ownership
but
of
sovereignty.
the
private
owner
would
not
take
them.
the
sovereign
would.
here
we
have
two
sovereigns,
the
question
is
which?
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
that's
what
i
meant.
yes,
sir.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
oh,
yes,
that's
clearly
what
the
international
law
is.
if
the
united
states
ceded
maine
to
canada
tomorrow,
and
i
hope
my
friend
the
attorney
general
of
maine
won't
kill
me
after
the
argument.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
there's
no
question
that
if
there
were
an
active
session
doing
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
need
to
say
we're
also
conveying
the
continental
shelf.
it's
never
done.
it's
never
done
with
territorial
waters
either.
they
go
implicitly,
automatically.
there
appurtenances
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
adjacent
coastline.
this
is
the
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
do
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
that's
the
only
kind
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no,
sir.
clearly
these
rights
are
coronary
of
sovereignty.
the
question
is
which
sovereignty
there
in
themselves
property
rights.
but
they
go
with
sovereignty
just
as
the
ownership
of
ungranted
lands
in
virginia
or
any
other
of
the
states
at
the
time
of
the
revolution.
they
belong
to
the
crown
before
that
in
the
case
of
the
crown
colony
like
virginia.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
public
lands
in
the
territory
of
virginia?
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
we're
not
talking
about
seabed
rights
now.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
ungranted
public
lands
in
virginia
belonged
to
the
crown
through
its
vehicle
the
colonial
government
of
virginia.
ungranted
lands
in
maryland
by
contrast
belong
to
the
border
of
baltimore
as
proprietor.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
on
the
5th
of
july,
the
state
of
virginia
and
the
state
of
maryland
owned
those
ungranted
lands.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
find
myself
in
the
difficulty
of
being
able
to
--
being
asked
to
take
plaintiff's
hypothetical
version
of
the
fact
seriously
which
i
find
it
hard
to
do
but
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
would
say
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
would
say
mr.
justice
white
that
prior
to
1945
or
at
anytime,
since
1789,
no
state
assertion
of
jurisdiction
of
title
to
these
resources
could
be
of
effective
without
at
least
the
tacit
consent
of
the
united
states
as
external
sovereign.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
at
least
tacitly.
at
least
not
in
opposition.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
that's
correct
sir.
i
turn
now
to
the
question
of
historic
title.
the
matter
is
necessarily
complex.
it
involves
the
law
and
practice
of
two
countries
and
to
some
extent
others
over
several
centuries
as
well
as
international
law,
custom,
and
practice.
while
the
master
conceded
some
of
the
lengths
in
the
states
chain
of
title,
he
resolved
other
questions
including
the
ultimate
questions
against
us.
my
discussion
was
will
necessary
be
very
brief.
i
can
only
hope
to
touch
on
the
few
of
the
principle
points
in
dispute.
we
have
tried
in
our
printed
papers
to
put
the
record
before
you
and
as
clear
and
as
useful
fashion
as
possible.
we
are
confident
that
in
immersion
in
this
record
will
lead
you
to
the
conclusion
that
the
plaintiff
and
the
master
are
just
plain
wrong.
in
the
first
instance,
the
states
historic
claims
rest
on
their
colonial
charters.
the
typical
charter
in
language
grants,
“all
fishings,
mines,
and
minerals,
both
within
the
same
track
of
land
upon
the
maine
and
also
within
the
said
islands
and
seas
adjoining.”
this
language
seems
to
us
to
be
wholly
categorical
and
ambiguous
as
showing
that
the
mineral
rights
and
the
adjoining
seas
were
granted.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
your
honor.
other
language
was
also
used
in
the
canadian
charters.
the
language
which
the
plaintiff
concedes
in
the
canadian
charters
did
establish
or
grant
the
ownership
of
the
seabed
is
the
language
all
seas
and
islands
within
so
many
miles
or
so
many
leagues.
as
i
shall
show
in
a
moment,
that
language
is
in
some
of
charters
too.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
as
i
say,
to
some
extent,
there
is
not
a
distinction
because
that
language
is
in
some
of
our
charters
as
well
but
the
charters
differ
among
themselves,
there
was
no
one
set
form
apparently
the
crown
formulated
what
it
wanted
to
grant
a
new
each
time.
some
of
the
charters
seem
to
be
based
on
each
other.
but
there
are
many
variations
that
don't
seem
to
have
any
particular
significance
of
any
reasons
for
them.
the
language
i
just
read
you
specifically
for
example
was
from
the
new
england
charter
1620.
the
second
virginia
charter
of
69
says
all,
i'm
paraphrasing
now
but
this
is
the
gist
of
it.
“all
fishings,
mines,
and
minerals,
and
other
royalties
within
the
said
limits
by
sea
and
land,
the
language
varies
the
intent
and
the
gist
and
the
result
we
think
is
the
same.
the
language
i
just
mentioned,
plaintiff
and
the
master
don't
even
mention.
while
they
talk
about
the
charters,
they
talk
only
about
other
charter
language
which
is
much
less
to
the
point.
some
of
the
charters
expressly
mentioned
all
the
seas
and
islands
within
specified
distances
from
shore.
plaintiff
admits
that
that
language
created
a
territorial
sea
in
the
case
of
canada.
but
somehow
fails
to
mention
it
when
it
analyzes
the
charters
in
our
states
chain
of
title.
there
is
much
other
language
in
the
charters
which
sheds
additional
light
in
which
we
think
provides
a
clear
answer
to
the
question
of
how
far
out
exclusive
rights
were
asserted
and
granted
in
the
american
marginal
seas.
the
language
i
read
you
first
from
the
new
england
charter,
we
think
beyond
the
doubt
conveys
fishings
and
minerals
in
the
seas
adjoining.
it
does
not
equal
weight
expressly
resolve
the
question
how
far
out.
we
have
set
forth
in
detail
in
our
briefs
and
i
won't
go
into
unless
there
are
questions
or
reasons
for
believing
that
in
the
legal
context
of
the
time
and
given
the
procession
of
the
charters,
the
progression
of
them
and
given
the
contemporaneous
interpretation
of
them
as
for
example
the
interpretation
during
the
1620s
by
the
counsel
for
new
england
of
its
1620
charter
which
specified
no
outside
limit
but
the
counsel
uniformly
interpreted
it
as
being
hundred
miles.
and
is
conveying
the
seas
and
islands
not
just
the
islands
given
all
this
and
much
other
background
that's
recited
in
our
briefs,
and
given
also
the
fact
that
every
charter
expressly
states
that
its
provisions
are
to
be
construed
in
case
of
any
ambiguity
in
the
light
most
favorable
to
the
grantee,
which
is
not
an
ideal
provision
i
submit.
we
think
that
charters
are
clear.
the
charter
language
must
of
course
be
read
against
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
approximately
for
all
the
12
states
your
honor,
approximately
25
although
most
of
the
states
had
two
or
three
charters.
virginia
had
three,
i
think
maryland
maybe
the
only
state
that
only
had
one.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
from
1606,
the
first
virginia
charter
down
through
the
georgia
charter
of
1730
something.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
over
a
hundred
years.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
let
me
quickly
summarize
the
states
assertions
about
the
historical
background
which
we
believe
have
been
demonstrated
beyond
any
question.
from
a
period
long
prior
to
and
including
the
17th
and
18th
centuries
under
english
law,
the
crown
possess
both
sovereignty
and
dominion
over
the
waters
surrounding
england
which
were
known
as
the
four
english
seas
and
their
seabed.
that
sovereignty
and
dominion
included
many
rights
among
those
rights
was
the
exclusive
right
to
export
continental
shelf
resources.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
no,
your
honor.
we
think
not.
there
were
many
periods
during
this
history
when
the
british
navy
was
quite
weak.
for
example,
some
of
king
charles'
proclamations
during
the
1630s,
said
we
need
a
large
navy
so
we
can
go
out
and
take
or
retake
possession
of
this
part
of
our
sovereign
territory
of
which
unfortunately
in
part
the
dutch
are
now
in
possession.
before
that
time,
for
some
years,
the
british
navy
had
not
been
very
strong
at
all.
it
was
strong
in
elizabeth's
time
but
in
the
later
years,
of
elizabeth's
reign
and
particularly
under
james
that
it
declined
very
badly.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
and
yet
it
was
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
sir.
yet,
it
was
james
who
perhaps
took
the
english
potentials
to
their
highest
pitch.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
sir.
the
english
seas
were
defined
uniformly
regardless
of
what
the
state
of
the
english
navy
was
as
extending
a
hundred
miles
from
sure
or
to
the
midpoint
between
england
and
the
office
at
coast.
there
were
special
exceptions
to
that
such
as
the
english
channel
in
the
bay
of
biscay
which
were
regarded
as
belonging
entirely
to
england
even
beyond
the
midway
line
because
the
king
of
england
claim
to
be
the
king
of
france.
england
admitted
those
were
french
waters
but
french
men
english
as
far
as
the
english
crown
was
concerned.
after
the
american
colonies
were
established,
england
sometimes
took
the
view
that
the
english
seas
embraced
all
the
waters
between
the
opposite
coast
of
england
in
north
america
on
the
theory
that
whoever
own
two
opposite
coastlines
owned
all
the
water
in
between.
but
the
more
general
view
was
that
that
was
unreasonable
and
that
the
colonies
have
their
own
hundred
mile
territorial
seas
with
international
waters
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean.
the
doctrine
of
maritime
sovereignty
and
dominion
was
naturally
indeed
inevitably
extended
to
this
side
of
the
atlantic
and
incorporated
into
the
colonial
charters.
the
charters
generally
created
territorial
seas
of
a
hundred
miles
in
with
in
which
the
colonies
own
among
other
rights,
the
right
involved
here.
in
a
few
cases,
of
specific
charters,
less
than
a
hundred
miles
was
granted.
sometimes
the
patentee
or
the
grantee
was
less
in
favor
with
the
crown
than
at
other
times
and
the
crown
wanted
to
withhold
some
of
that
territorial
sea
for
itself.
that
mainly
happened
in
new
england
during
the
later
charters
when
the
crown
was
beginning
to
see
that
the
puritans
up
there
were
not
entirely
friendly
to
crown
prerogatives.
so
in
the
case
of
maine
and
new
hampshire
for
example
the
crown
said
alright
we'll
just
give
you
five
leagues
and
we'll
keep
the
rest
for
our
self.
throughout
the
colonial
period,
the
colonies
exercise
their
rights
in
the
marginal
seas
to
the
fullest
extent
practicable
or
necessary.
at
the
revolution,
the
states
individual
jury,
inherited
the
rights
of
the
colonies
and
also
inherited
whatever
rights
the
crown
had
retained
in
the
motion
to
cease.
thus,
these
states
acquire
the
exclusive
right
if
exportation.
that
right
has
not
been
lost
by
any
subsequent
event
or
development.
it
was
not
ceded
to
the
united
states
or
the
constitution.
it
was
not
renounced
to
the
world
at
large.
it
was
not
lost
through
any
changes
in
international
law.
it
remains
intact.
although
the
record,
with
respect
to
english
law
and
practice
goes
back
far
behind
the
17th
century,
that
century
is
a
particular
importance
for
two
reasons.
first
out
was
the
century
when
the
defendant
states
were
founded
these
english
colonies
and
their
charters
were
granted.
second,
the
17th
is
the
century
were
all
the
parties
before
you
and
the
master
are
closest
to
agreement
about
english
law
and
practice.
although
remain
some
differences
between
us,
the
master
acknowledged
that
by
the
middle
of
that
century
at
any
rate,
english
law
fully
recognized
that
the
crown
own
the
resources
of
the
seabed
of
the
english
seas
and
indeed
on
the
seabed
itself.
the
plaintiff
have
dispute
to
that
before
the
master,
but
plaintiff
witnesses
largely
conceded
it.
in
its
brief
to
the
court,
the
plaintiff
does
not
appear
to
dispute
the
point.
certainly,
plaintiff
has
not
accepted
from
the
master's
conclusion.
no
one
denies
that
during,
throughout
the
17th
century,
england
was
intensely
concerned
with
rights
in
sea
surrounding
england
including
the
seabed
and
that
this
concern
and
the
crown's
high
view
of
its
own
sovereignty
and
dominion
in
the
seas
were
fully
incorporated
to
law
as
well
carried
out
in
policy.
if
there
were
any
dispute,
the
record
is
massive
conclusive.
this
then
is
concededly
the
political
and
legal
atmosphere
in
which
the
colonial
charters
of
these
defendant
states
were
granted.
now,
the
master
found
that
crown
ownership
of
the
seabed
became
fully
recognized
in
english
law
only
towards
the
middle
of
the
century
with

of

hailes

treat
us.
the
master
concluded
that
the
doctrine
does
the
states
no
good.
since
the
earlier
colonial
charters
antedated
1635.
there
are
several
answers.
first,
even
if
the
master
were
right,
the
change
in
the
law
which
he
thinks
occurred
about
1635
would
have
been
applied
on
this
side
of
the
ocean
as
well
as
the
other
unless
there
were
some
good
reasons
for
not
so
applying
it.
no
one
has
suggested
such
a
reason.
plaintiff's
witness,
professor
morris
admitted
that
there
was
no
such
reason,
that's
at
page
538
of
the
appendix.
second,
almost
every
colony
including
those
which
had
earlier
charters
also
had
subsequent
charters
issued
between
1635
and
1700.
a
period
when
the
master
admits
the
doctrine
of
crown
ownership
of
the
seabed
was
fully
embodied
in
english
law.
third,
the
record
proves
that
the
master
wrong
in
his
dating.
maritime
sovereignty
and
dominion
which
included
the
right
here
at
issue,
long
preceded
1635
or
even
1600.
at
pages
64,
65
of
our
brief,
we
very
shortly
summarize
the
court
cases
works
for
jurisprudence
and
state
papers
including
things
like
acts
of
the
king
and
counsel
which
plaintiff's
witness
admitted
had
full
legal
force
which
proved
the
law
of
the
period
1600
to
1635.
just
for
example
in
1610
in
highest
court,
preview
counsel
in
the
case
of
the
royal
fishery
of
the
band
held
that
the
sea
is
of
the
legions
of
the
king
and
is
also
his
proper
inheritance.
there
is
sovereignty.
there
is
dominion,
legions,
inheritance.
and
therefore,
the
king
shall
have
the
land
which
is
gained
out
of
the
sea.
it's
his
before
so
when
it
isn't
sea
anymore,
it's
still
is
his.
robert
coles
writing
in
1622
repeatedly
declared
it
to
be
the
law
of
england
that
the
seabeds
was
the
king's
when
it
was
covered
with
waters.
selden's
book
itself
was
written
by
1618
and
was
well
known
to
the
crown
and
the
government
from
that
time
forward.
as
to
the
pre
and
post
17th
century
periods.
the
master
in
the
plaintiff
claim
with
english
law
allowed
only
for
english
jurisdiction
in
the
english
seas
not
for
seabed
ownership.
in
fact
there
was
evidence
as
far
back
as
the
13th
century
both
that
seabed
ownership
was
recognized
and
that
the
english
seas
were
regarded
as
fully
apart
of
the
realm
of
england.
however,
taking
plaintiff
in
the
master
on
their
own
terms,
what
was
the
content
of
the
jurisdiction
which
they
more
or
less
concede.
plaintiff's
witness,
professor
thorne
admitted
that
that
jurisdiction
included
the
right
to
grant
exclusive
fisheries
in
the
seas.
such
grants
included
sedentary
that
is
seabed
fisheries.
he
also
conceded
that
the
jurisdiction
included
the
right
to
tax
sea
fisheries.
undisputed
documents,
the
record
show
that
the
jurisdiction
included
the
right
both
to
define
by
statute
and
to
punish
in
the
courts
crime
at
sea,
and
the
right
to
regulate
the
time,
manner,
and
extent
of
fishing
for
conservation
and
other
purposes.
plaintiff's
brief
at
page
34
concedes
that
the
jurisdiction
included
the
power
to
regulate
fisheries.
that
power
plainly
extended
to
sedentary
fisheries
and
other
seabed
resources
as
well.
and
the
power
to
regulate
includes
the
power
to
license
and
to
tax.
if
plaintiff
says
that
i
misunderstood
them,
and
thinking
they're
making
these
concessions
that
i've
been
too
broad
that
they're
not
making
them.
that
they're
retracting
them
and
the
fact
is
that
the
concessions
whether
they
are
still
making
them
or
not
are
utterly
required
by
the
record
which
is
crystal
clear
on
all
these
points.

m.
clagett
like

your
honor.
non-mobile
fish
on
the
seabed.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
fish.
plainly
then,
even
if
the
crown
had
not
been
recognized
as
owning
title
to
seabed
land,
the
jurisdiction
which
by
concession
existed
and
which
if
not
by
concession
certainly
exist
by
the
record
embraced
by
the
right
to
regulate,
to
license,
and
to
tax
the
private
exploitation
of
maritime
resources
both
surface
and
seabed.
that
of
course
is
the
precise
right
at
issue
in
this
case
whether
it
is
called
jurisdiction,
ownership,
sovereignty
or
anything
else
is
of
no
consequence.
this
then
is
the
background
of
english
law
necessary
to
understand
what
happened
when
the
american
colony
is
the
predecessors
of
these
defendant
states
were
founded.
and
as
i've
suggested,
when
you
look
at
the
colonial
charters,
you
find
precisely
what
you
would
expect
to
find
in
the
light
of
that
legal
background.
the
plaintiff
and
the
master
have
portrayed
the
17th
century
english
colonization
of
north
america.
as
fundamentally
indifferent
to
maritime
affairs
and
maritime
resources
nothing
could
possibly
be
farther
from
the
truth.
from
the
very
beginning
of
colonization
in
elizabeth's
reign,
england's
expansion
into
the
new
world
focused
largely
if
not
primarily
on
control
of
the
sea
and
exploitation
of
maritime
resources,
fish,
pearls,
and
precious
metals
if
they
can
be
found.
the
very
first
act
of
the
english
colonization
in
north
america
was
the
expulsion
of
fisherman
of
other
nations
from
the
new
finland
fisheries
in
1582.
and
when
king
james
asked
the
pilgrims
why
they
wanted
to
go
to
new
england,
they
replied
in
one
word
“fishing.”
every
schools

mr.
brice
m.
clagett
that's
what
they
said
when
they
were
asked
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
apparently,
freedom
of
religion
was
something
else.
every
school
child
knows
how
heavily
colonization
focused
on
precious
things
like
gold,
silver,
and
pearls.
seventeenth
century
england
as
we
have
seen
was
in
the
highest
degree
contrast
of
the
importance
of
exclusive
rights
of
sovereignty
and
ownership
in
its
waters.
and
the
very
persons,
the
individuals
most
active
in
the
chartering
and
founding
of
the
american
colonies
were
the
same
people
responsible
for
maintaining
english
maritime
sovereignty
at
home.
we've
given
a
long
list
of
them
with
short
paragraphical
descriptions.
given
this
background,
it
is
flatly
incredible
that
english
law
did
not
extend
to
the
american
marginal
seas.
the
same
principles
of
maritime
sovereignty
and
dominion
which
were
so
fully
established
in
english
waters.
we
have
produced
conclusive
evidence
of
this
is
what
did
happen
and
what
was
recognized
to
happen.
england
expressly
claimed
and
exercised
sovereignty
and
dominion
in
american
waters
on
many
occasions.
i
pass
over
briefly
the
evidence
demonstrating
that
throughout
the
colonial
period,
the
colonies
and
the
home
government
were
intensely
aware
of
maritime
rights
of
sovereignty
and
ownership.
they
exercised
control
over
the
american
marginal
seas
as
fully
as
was
either
necessary
or
appropriate
in
view
of
the
limited
opportunities
for
exportation
which
the
technology
of
the
time
afforded.
in
the
nature
of
things
that
control
was
primarily
directed
to
fisheries.
and
the
evidence
is
most
extensive
for
the
areas
where
the
fisheries
were
richest
and
the
thread
of
foreign
incursion
greatest.
that
is
the
waters
of
canada
and
northern
new
england.
in
those
waters,
there's
no
question
that
exclusive
rights
were
claimed
and
foreigners
were
forcibly
excluded.
plaintiff
concedes
that
as
to
canadian
waters.
there's
no
difference
as
far
as
maine
goes.
similar
issues
rarely
arose
south
of
boston
where
the
fisheries
were
less
reached
and
there
were
no
nearby
french
bases
from
which
forays
could
be
attempted.
no
one
steep
in
this
record
i
assert,
your
honors
can
doubt
what
position
england
would
have
taken
if
the
french
or
anyone
else
had
tried
to
come
in.
even
if
the
plaintiff
were
correct,
that
to
own
the
sea,
you
must
occupy
it.
these
waters
were
in
fact
occupied
by
england
and
its
colonies
to
the
exclusion
of
others.
in
its
own
brief
to
the
master,
page
143,
the
plaintiff
conceded
that
during
this
era,
control
of
the
adjacent
land
meant
control
of
the
fisheries.
the
issue
of
course
did
not
arise
with
specific
reference
to
offshore
mineral
exploitation
because
no
minerals
were
discovered
during
the
colonial
period
which
were
susceptible
of
exploitation.
but
the
force
and
applicability
of
the
law
of
a
given
period
are
not
limited
to
the
precise
factual
situations
which
arose.
sometimes,
it
is
possible
to
say
with
total
confidence
on
the
basis
of
evidence
in
hand,
that
if
a
particular
situation
had
arisen,
a
particular
known
legal
and
political
system
would
have
reacted
to
it
in
a
particular
knowable
way.
that
is
the
situation
here.
suppose
that
at
anytime,
during
the
colonial
period,
a
valuable
pearl
bed
or
gold
deposit
had
been
discovered
on
a
shallow
but
submerged
bed,
bank
or
reef,
say
10
miles
off
the
coast
of
any
of
these
defendant
states.
plaintiff's
position
requires
it
to
argue
that
england
and
the
adjacent
colony
would
have
asserted
no
exclusive
right
or
with
that
pearl
bed
or
gold
mine
but
would
have
regarded
the
resources
free
to
exportation
by
all
the
world.
that
position
defies
both
common
sense
and
everything
that
we
know
about
the
law,
attitude
and
practices
of
that
period
and
of
every
period
before
and
since.
nations
have
never
acted
that
way.
they
have
uniformly
acted
the
opposite
way.
all
four
of
plaintiff's
witnesses
who
testified
on
the
colonial
period
conceded
that
in
the
circumstances
i've
suggested,
the
resource
would
have
been
claimed
as
an
exclusive
possession
of
the
adjacent
coastal
sovereign.
any
foreign
incursion
would
have
been
driven
off.
the
courts
would
have
upheld
that
action
as
a
legal
right
if
anyone
had
challenged
it
which
is
unlikely.
we
think
these
concessions
by
plaintiff's
witnesses
which
the
record
requires
are
in
themselves
enough
to
make
out
the
states
case.
i
now
come
to
the
period
of
the
formation
of
the
union.
i've
touched
on
this
in
the
earlier
portion
of
the
argument
to
the
extent
that
constitution
and
the
western
lands
controversy
are
involved.
i
shall
only
state
our
contentions
in
very
summary
form.
first,
the
historical
record
and
the
consistent
decisions
of
this
court
with
the
sole
exception
of
the
dicta
in
the
kurdish
right
case
are
overwhelmingly
to
the
effect
that
prior
to
the
constitution
that
is
from
the
beginning
of
the
american
revolution
through
the
confederation
period,
the
states
were
individually
sovereign
up
to
and
including
being
international
persons
subjects
of
international
law.
chief
justice
marshall
for
example
expressly
so
held
in
gibbons
versus
ogden
in
1824,
and
there
are
many
other
cases
which
is
cited
in
our
briefs.
second,
be
that
as
it
may,
each
state
was
deemed
to
have
succeeded
to
all
the
territorial
and
ownership
rights
of
its
predecessor
colonial
governments.
as
defined
by
its
charters
and
to
all
ownership
rights
pertaining
thereto
which
prior
to
the
revolution
had
been
vested
in
the
crown.
it's
hard
to
over
emphasize
the
explicitness
of
the
documents
of
record
in
showing
how
zealously
the
founding
fathers
guarded
the
territorial
and
property
claims
of
each
state
individually,
and
how
categorically
they
rested
on
the
individual
rights
of
succession
by
each
state
separately
to
its
colonial
charters
and
to
the
crown
prerogatives
as
continuing
unimpaired.
this
right
then,
this
exclusive
right
to
exploit
shelf
resources
was
one
of
the
maritime
rights
which
this
defendant
states
had
by
virtue
of
english
law
and
their
charters
long
before
the
plaintiff
here
came
into
existence.
they
have
never
lost
it,
it
remains
intact.
as
to
plaintiff's
argument
that
the
right
was
abandoned
or
destroyed
by
virtue
of
the
three-mile
limit,
i
will
have
to
rest
on
our
briefs
because
there
is
one
final
matter
i
need
to
mention.
that
is
the
matter
of
possible
further
proceedings
after
the
court
decides
this
case
whichever
way
the
court
decides
certain
questions
will
remain
of
the
limiting
boundaries
or
baselines
with
respect
to
specific
maritime
areas.
the
case
of
course
heard
--
the
court
of
course
heard
the
case
presenting
such
an
issue
just
this
morning.
the
plaintiff
apparently,
takes
the
view
that
a
decree
by
this
court
deciding
the
issues
argued
today
and
declaring
in
general
terms
that
either
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendants
own
the
outer
continental
shelf
will
terminate
the
case.
in
its
early
pleadings,
the
plaintiff
said
that
it
sought
only
a
decree
which
would
settle
the
general
issue
“without
determining
the
physical
location
of
the
area
on
the
ground
in
any
particular
locality.”
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
if
you
decide
from
us
--
for
us,
your
honor.
there
would
be
left
the
question
first
of
lateral
boundaries
between
the
states
and
also
the
question
of
the
outer
boundary
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
the
dividing
line
would
be
between
the
rights
of
the
states
and
the
rights
of
the
international
community
but
it
still
might
need
to
be
adjudicated
at
some
time.
there
would
still
also,
perhaps
need
to
be
decided
even
in
that
event
your
honor,
the
dividing
line
between
internal
and
territorial
waters
not
for
purposes
of
this
case
but
simply
because
national
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
for
the
purposes
of
some
other
case
not
this
case,
there
may
need
to
be
decided
at
some
point
the
dividing
lines
between
internal
waters,
territorial
waters
and
the
waters
overlying
the
continental
shelf
simply
because
the
rights
of
the
states
the
federal
government
and
the
world
that
are
different
in
each
case
wholly
without
regard
to
the
right
to
exploit
seabed
resources.
the
right
of
innocent
passage
for
example.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
sir.
we
agree
with
plaintiff's
position
on
this
point.
while
the
court's
decision
will
leave
certain
specific
question
undecided,
the
appropriate
forum
for
those
questions
we
submit
is
the
district
courts.
under
legislation
enacted
in
1972,
the
states
can
initiate
quiet
title
proceedings
against
the
federal
government.
the
united
states
has
been
able
to
do
the
same
against
the
states
for
many
years.
the
federal
government
has
chosen
that
route
as
you
know
to
litigate
the
question
of
the
waters
of
alaska.
that
case
is
now
before
you
on
certiorari.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
don't
have
to
answer
that.
massachusetts
--
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
connecticut
is
not
among
my
clients
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
the
united
states
didn't
sue
them.
now,
i
would
have
to
speculate
as
to
why
they
didn't
sue
them
but
i
suppose
the
theory
was
that
they're
cut
off
by
long
island
and
perhaps
long
island
south.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
accurate
or
not.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
well,
that
is
plainly
true.
massachusetts
has
now
chosen
the
same
route
by
seeking
a
district
court
adjudication
of
the
baseline
defining
its
internal
waters.
others
of
the
defendant
states
here
are
considering
bringing
similar
actions.
the
mutual
availability
of
this
route
which
was
not
the
case
until
two
years
ago
makes
it
unnecessary
for
this
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
as
it
did
in
prior
cases
to
work
out
these
questions
of
detail
by
itself.
we
think
the
district
court
proceedings
are
plainly
of
more
appropriate
forum
to
resolve
by
evidentiary
trials
these
complex
questions
of
geography
and
local
history
which
perhaps
you
had
your
feel
of
already.
they
are
probably
more
expeditious
forum
also.
massachusetts
has
filed
a
reply
brief
discussing
this
matter
in
detail
and
i'm
authorize
to
say
that
each
of
the
other
defendant
states
concurs
in
the
position
espouse
by
massachusetts
and
adopts
it
as
its
own.
thank
you.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
prefer
that.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
one
or
two
things
to
say
about
each
of
the
solicitor
general's
four
arguments.
first,
the
alleged
preclusion
by
california,
he
says
if
i
understood
him
correctly
that
california
holds
only
that
if
a
state
has
no
historic
title
and
the
court
must
decide
in
the
absence
of
such
a
title
then
the
federal
interests
are
stronger
and
would
prevail.
he
disclaims
as
i
understood
in
many
argument
that
the
federal
interest
would
require
overriding
in
a
historic
title
because
the
shelf
is
in
necessary
appurtenance
of
federal
constitutional
powers.
this
fights
in
the
face
however
of
his
other
argument
that
even
if
the
states
had
in
historic
title
at
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
they
then
lost
it.
they
would
lose
it
surely
only
if
it
was
necessary
for
the
federal
government
to
have
it,
to
protect
its
constitutional
interest.
and
if
it
is
thus
necessary,
how
can
congress
give
it
away.
the
solicitor
general,
i
submit
cannot
have
it
at
both
ways.
if
congress
was
free
to
give
part
of
the
shelf
to
the
states
in
1953,
then
shelf
ownership
is
not
necessary
to
federal
powers
as
he
admits,
and
since
it
is
not
necessary
then
the
constitution
would
not
have
taken
on
historic
state
title
away.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
not
in
the
event
of
an
antecedent
historic
title
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
a
title
to
property
which
was
vested
in
a
state
before
and
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
could
only
be
taken
if
there
were
some
constitutional
necessity
for
taking
it.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
your
honor
and
that's
precisely
why
the
act
has
to
be
unconstitutional
if
congress
was
wrong
on
that
point.
there's
no
dispute
here
as
i
understand
it
that
if
the
states
did
have
a
vested
title
and
property
then
the
outer
continental
shelf
act
is
unconstitutional.
i
take
it
the
point
concedes
that.
i
might
add
that
the
congress
did
its
best
to
restore
to
the
states
all
the
title
which
it
was
then
aware
that
the
states
had.
probably,
because
no
valuable
resources
as
of
that
time
had
been
discovered
in
the
atlantic
ocean,
nobody
done
his
homework
and
nobody
knew
what
the
history
was
and
the
states
were
not
then
articulating
their
claim
very
well.
so,
congress
passed
that
act
under
a
misapprehension.
it
intended
to
and
it
thought
it
was
restoring
to
the
states
all
the
title
they
had.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
these
are
the
--
both
acts
taken
together.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
i
would
add
that
there
is
no
need
for
you
to
overrule
the
holding
of
california
in
order
to
decide
for
the
states
here.
that
holding
of
course
was
the
california
did
not
own
the
three-mile
belt.
if
you
hold
in
our
favor
on
the
basis
of
an
historic
title,
then
that
holding
would
not
apply
to
any
state
which
might
california
lack
such
a
title.
to
be
sure,
california
and
other
states
might
renew
their
claim
but
the
"equal
footing"
doctrine
would
require
them
to
have
the
same
amount
of
shelf
as
the
atlantic
states.
but
the
court
could
well
hold
as
it
did
in
alabama
versus
texas
quite
clearly
that
the
"equal
footing"
doctrine
requires
nothing
of
the
kind.
it
does
not
require
that
every
state
own
an
equal
amount
of
continental
shelf
any
more
that
it
requires
that
every
state
have
its
large
of
land
territory
as
the
state
of
texas
and
the
state
of
alaska.
i
think
i
fail
to
make
myself
altogether
clear
yesterday
as
to
the
circumstances
in
which
if
the
court
should
decide
in
our
favor,
federal
intervention
in
the
shelf
would
require
compensation
to
the
states
and
the
circumstances
in
which
it
would
not.
now
as
i
see
at
three
possible
situations.
one,
the
federal
government
takes
oil
or
there
shelf
resources
owned
by
the
states
for
its
own
use.
that
plainly
would
be
a
taking
and
would
require
compensation.
two,
the
federal
government
by
treaty
agrees
with
other
nations
that
the
continental
shelf
under
exclusive
american
ownership
is
not
as
large
as
it
is
now
considered
to
be.
thereby,
cutting
of
state
ownership
as
to
some
parts
of
it
that
would
a
federal
act
to
adjusting
boundaries
or
settling
international
law
in
the
exercise
of
the
foreign
affairs
power.
it
would
not
in
my
submission
be
a
taking
and
it
would
not
require
compensation.
i
might
add
that
the
question
of
that
question
is
wholly
academic
at
least
as
to
the
foreseeable
future
because
the
whole
tendency
in
international
law
and
policy
at
the
moment
is
to
expand
continental
shelf
rights
not
to
cut
them
back.
three,
the
federal
government
in
the
interest
either
of
national
defense
or
for
economic
reasons
tells
the
states
that
they
must
develop
shelf
resources
faster
or
differently
from
what
they
are
doing.
the
state’s
retaining
ownership
and
still
receiving
the
revenues
that
would
not
be
a
taking
quite
clearly
and
would
not
require
compensation
anymore
for
example;
than
federal
resource
allocation
during
world
war
ii
did
or
any
of
the
other
kinds
of
paramount
power
that
the
federal
government
habitually
assert
especially
in
times
of
national
emergency
overall
the
resources
of
the
country.
it
would
be
perfectly
proper
federal
regulation
thus
a
decision
for
the
states
here
will
in
no
way
retire
or
hamper
continental
shelf
exploitation
or
development
if
the
national
interest
is
found
to
require
that.
next,
as
to
the
solicitor
general's
argument
that
the
states
never
acquired
any
property
interest
in
the
shelf,
it
is
hard
to
respond
to
this
because
it
was
stated
almost
entirely
in
conclusory
terms
without
reasons
or
facts.
the
solicitor
general
did
make
one
specific
statement
however.
he
said
that
the
hundred-mile
rule
was
recognized
on
only
two
occasions
by
--
and
the
earl
of
salisbury
to
the
contrary.
the
hundred-mile
rule
was
declared
by
among
others
the
following
eminent
british
authorities:
william
welwood
in
1613,
gerald
malynes
in
1622,
thomas
neal
in
1704,
sir
charles
hedges,
admiralty
judge
and
secretary
of
state,
in
a
formal
legal
opinion
of
1713,
and
josiah
burchett,
secretary
of
the
admiralty
in
1720.
further
proof
is
found
in
the
colonial
charters
themselves
beginning
with
the
charter
of
1606
which
created
a
hundred-mile
territorial
sea
all
up
and
down
the
coast
of
these
very
defendant
states.
as
shown
in
our
supplemental
brief
in
detail
and
addition
the
overwhelming
consensus
of
international
law
authority
throughout
the
17th
and
18th
centuries
was
in
favor
a
hundred-mile
territorial
sea.
finally
and
perhaps
conclusively,
13
leagues
which
is
virtually
identical
to
a
hundred
miles
was
the
boundary
asserted
and
enforced
by
britain
throughout
the
17th
and
18th
centuries
for
its
territorial
sea
and
exclusive
fishing
rights
in
these
very
waters
here
under
dispute
in
north
america.
as
to
--
that
boundary
was
incorporated
into
the
treaty
of
utrecht
in
1713.
but
britain
regarded
the
13
leagues
applicable
all
up
and
down
the
coast
of
these
states
as
well.
the
proof
is
our
exhibit
327,
in
map
volume
3
of
our
appendix
which
is
the
british
copy
the
very
--
british
map
used
in
the
peace
negotiations
of
paris
in
1782-83.
that
map
shows
the
13-league
boundary
drawn
all
the
way
down
the
coast
of
these
defendants'
states.
i
can
only
--
i
have
no
time
to
discuss
the
solicitor
general's
assertions
about
the
australia
and
canadian
cases.
i
can
only
say
that
we
submit
they
are
widely
inaccurate.
i
can
only
beg
to
the
court
to
study
pages
477
through
85
of
our
supplemental
brief
on
that
subject.
next,
the
solicitor
general
contends
its
federal
government
would've
succeeded
to
any
continental
shelf
rights
than
in
existence
at
independents
or
sometime
around
there.
i
can
confess
as
i
heard
the
solicitor
general
was
eloquent
about
the
sovereignty
of
the
first
continental
congress.
i
was
wondering
why
we
were
not
celebrating
the
bicentennial
this
year
instead
of
waiting
for
some
later
wholly
ancillary
event.
on
the
point
of
whether
the
states
were
ever
fully
sovereign,
the
key
to
understanding
the
events
of
that
period
we
submit
is
that
the
states
were
regarded
as
identical
to
the
united
states
not
the
united
states
being
a
distinct
and
separate
national
government
in
any
sense.
it
was
the
united
states
of
new
hampshire
of
massachusetts,
etcetera.
the
term
was
always
spelled
out
in
full
in
that
fashion.
of
course
the
states
carried
on
foreign
relations
not
only
separately
which
they
did
to
a
quite
considerable
extent
but
primarily
through
their
joint
representatives.
congress
was
the
states.
congress
was
made
up
of
ambassadors
from
the
states
known
as
congressman.
every
treaty
that
congress
made
was
made
in
the
name
of
each
one
of
the
states
enumerated
separately.
the
nature
of
the
confederation
was
exactly
what
the
articles
of
confederation
and
carefully
chosen
language
said
it
was
a
firm
league
of
friendship.
and
it
was
universally
recognized
that
the
federal
league
or
confederation
was
a
group
of
several
sovereign
states
which
retain
their
full
individual
sovereignty
that
tell
in
--
who
the
international
lawyers
best
known
to
the
founding
fathers
expressly
so
stated.
chief
justice
marshall
agreed
as
i
have
mentioned
yesterday
in
gibbons
versus
ogden.
he
declared
that
the
states
"were
sovereign,
were
completely
independent
and
were
connected
with
each
other
only
by
a
league."
there's
nothing
to
the
contrary
in
penhallow
versus
doane
which
merely
holds
that
congress
had
the
power
to
erect
an
admiralty
court
with
appellate
jurisdiction
from
the
state
highest
courts
for
the
reason
that
the
states
and
in
particular
new
hampshire,
the
state
which
was
there
contesting
it
had
consented
to
it.
there's
not
a
word
in
the
case
of
any
inherent
federal
sovereignty
derived
from
the
crown
or
if
any
federal
powers
other
than
those
granted
by
the
states.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
indeed,
there
is
your
honor.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
yes,
sir.
and
of
course
it
purports
to
cite
penhallow
but
as
julius
goebel
said
in
his
first
volume
of
the
history
of
this
court
some
slightly
sloppy
language
in
penhallow
was
then
used
curtiss-wright
to
support,
i
forgot
the
exact
words
in
utterly
inadmissible
version
of
historical
events.
even
if
the
solicitor
general
were
right
about
sovereignty,
even
if
he
were
right
which
he
isn't,
the
historical
record
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
show
beyond
any
question
whatever
that
the
united
states
was
never
regarded
as
acquiring
any
territory
or
property
other
than
in
right
of
one
of
the
individual's
states
and
nothing
was
ceded
to
the
federal
government
but
what
was
expressly
ceded.
the
constitution
draws
the
sharpest
possible
distinction
between
the
territory
and
property
of
the
states
which
remain
intact
and
the
paramount
rights
of
the
federal
government
which
were
superimposed
upon
them,
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
transferred
no
territory
and
no
property.
finally,
as
to
the
solicitor
general's
claim
that
our
continental
shelf
rights
were
destroyed
by
the
three-mile
limit.
our
briefs
and
the
testimony
at
the
trial
particularly
that
of
judge
philip
gesoff
who
is
the
world’s
leading
authority
on
the
subject
proved
beyond
the
shadow
of
the
doubt,
that
the
solicitor
general’s
argument
is
wrong.
the
three-mile
limit
applied
only
to
surface
waters
never
to
the
seabed.
as
this
court
itself
said
in
the
second
louisiana
case,
maritime
boundaries
to
different
distances
are
recognized
for
different
purposes.
the
united
states
never
construed
the
three-mile
limit
as
cutting
off
seabed
rights.
wholly
to
the
contrary
in
the
bearing
sea
arbitration,
the
united
states
took
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
that
the
three-mile
limit
had
no
application
to
seabed
rights.
and
the
united
states
like
every
other
nation
asserted
exclusive
ownership
of
seabed
resources
beyond
three
miles
wherever
they
existed
and
were
exploitable
as
in
the
case
of
the
philippine
pearl
fisheries.
mr.
brice
m.
clagett
the
three-mile
limit
was
first
mentioned
by
anyone
as
a
boundary
for
neutrality
purposes
only
by
thomas
jefferson
in
his
letters
to
the
ambassadors
within
in
a
year
or
two
of
1790
and
1791.
it
was
never
applied
to
anything
more
than
neutrality
purposes
for
some
decades
thereafter
and
it
was
never
applied
to
the
seabed.
finally,
i
must
say
that
we
would
of
course
like
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
whatever
the
solicitor
general
may
say
about
further
proceedings
on
this
paper
he
was
going
to
file.
we
would
therefore
ask
the
court
to
set
a
short
time
limit
for
his
paper
and
one
for
our
response.
