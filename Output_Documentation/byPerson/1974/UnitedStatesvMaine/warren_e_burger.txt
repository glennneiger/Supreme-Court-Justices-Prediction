is
that
not
a
rather
unique
form
of

if

term?
if
it's
subject
to
those
burdens?
chief

on
the
basis
of
records
and
recording
of
the
argument.

what
was
the

e.
burger
it
will
sustain
your
position,
are
you?
chief

e.

would
you
to
show
that
the
united
states
of
1774,
1775,
1776,
and

exercised
all
the
powers
of
sovereignty
including
raising
the
environment.
chief

e.

mr.
solicitor
general,
mr.
clagett
suggested
that
the
doctrine
of
the
voting
in
the
california
case
again
suffer
some
erosion
or
at
least
further
erosion
by
the
1953
submerged
lands
act.
do
you
have
any
comment
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
clagett,
you
have
14
minutes
left

divide
between
three
minutes
now
and
tomorrow,
we
will
give
you
the
option
of
doing
it
all
tomorrow

prefer
that?

very
well.

warren
e.
burger
mr.
clagett,
you
may
continue.
you
have
14
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this,
in
your
view
then
it
is
not
within
the
power
of
the
sovereign
to
decide
in
what
particular
instances
it
might
be
necessary
and
in
other
instances
that
it
could
be
yielded
in
part
that
that
is
not
within
the
broad
sovereign
power.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
congress
in
passing
that
act
assumed
and
of
course
acted
on
the
assumption
that
it
had
the
title,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
clagett.
when
the
solicitor
general
and
if
he
files
a
further
proceedings,

have
10
days
to
respond
to
it.
