mr.
robert
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
submits
that
the
law
in
governing
this
case
is
clear
and
leaves
in
our
opinion
no
room
for
doubt
that
united
states
has
the
paramount
right
to
the
natural
resources
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
under
--
mr.
robert
bork
if
we
might
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
would
like
to
form
that
a
position
on
that
and
submit
it
to
the
court
in
the
near
future
before
this
case
is
decided.
mr.
robert
bork
well,
there
certainly
will
be
questions
about
the
lines
in
various
areas,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
questions
--
mr.
robert
bork
right
now,
this
case
is
not
presented.
but
we
are
already
discussing
the
ownership
and
but
there
will
come
problems
of
drawing
--
mr.
robert
bork
but
this
case
does
not
present
it
at
the
present
stage.
mr.
robert
bork
well,
it
may
have
to
be
determined
somewhere
and
we
would
like
you
if
we
may
to
reserve
the
formulation
on
presentation
of
the
position
to
this
court
on
whether
it
should
go
to
the
district
court
to
the
special
master.
we'll
do
that
very
shortly.
mr.
robert
bork
that
is
--
mr.
robert
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
bork
as
i
was
saying,
i
think
the
case
law
here
is,
the
case
law
in
the
history
is
so
clear
that
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
ownership
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
and
that
it
inheres
the
united
states.
now,
defendants
have
an
extended
discussion
of
evidence
asserted
to
establish
english
law
in
its
application
to
this
country.
i
would
point
out
that
it's
rebutted
by
our
briefs.
it
was
decided
against
them
by
the
special
master's
careful
report
but
i
think
ultimately
it
can
also
be
if
the
legal
principles
governing
this
case
are
applied
that
disputed
by
english
law
and
so
forth
can
be
perceived
as
essentially
irrelevant
and
not
to
obscure
the
legal
principles
that
control
this
case.
although
we
have
no
doubt
that
this
special
master's
finding
on
english
law
and
their
application
to
this
country
are
quite
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
special
master's
report
shows
and
as
the
brief
show
the
position
of
united
states
is
supported
by
so
many
independent
lines
of
arguments.
so
many
independent
lines
of
law
but
there
are
some
difficulty
in
choosing
the
parts
distressed.
and
i
will
here
today
urge
briefly
for
propositions
acceptance
of
any
one
of
these
propositions
requires
that
judgment
be
entered
for
the
united
states.
for
that
reason,
it
is
not
necessary
to
review
every
factual
finding
made
by
the
special
master
although
as
i
say
we
believe
them
all
clearly
correct.
i
will
urge
first
that
as
the
special
master
concluded
the
issue
involved
here
has
already
been
decided
repeatedly
in
favor
of
the
united
states
by
this
course
in
the
california
decision
and
louisiana
and
the
texas
cases.
application
of
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
is
also
in
judgment
for
the
united
states.
secondly,
i
would
urge
that
the
special
master
was
correct
in
finding
upon
the
record
made
that
these
states
never
acquired
any
property
rights
in
the
seabed
of
the
atlantic
coast,
and
certainly
didn't
retain
in
these
such
rights
a
historical
record
which
establishes
that
the
california
decision
was
correct
in
the
first
place.
thirdly,
it
is
completely
clear
in
any
event
than
the
special
master
so
found
that
if
there
was
any
right
in
the
colonies
or
in
the
english
crown
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
which
we
deny.
that
claim
would
have
passed
the
united
states
at
independence
or
upon
ratification
of
the
constitution.
and
finally,
the
special
master
also
found
and
we
believe
correctly
that
even
if
it
claimed
to
the
outer
continental
shelf
once
existed
and
somehow
pass
to
the
states
instead
of
to
the
national
government.
the
national
government
constitutionally
renounced
the
states
claims
when
it
adopted
the
three-mile
limit
which
was
its
clear
constitutional
--
within
its
clear
constitutional
power.
the
area
was
then
reclaimed
as
against
foreign
nations
in
1945
by
president
truman's
proclamation
and
as
against
the
states
by
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
of
1953.
anyone
of
these
propositions
as
i
say
requires
judgment
of
the
united
states
and
i
think
it's
demonstrable
that
all
four
are
correct.
the
argument
from
stare
decisis
of
course
turns
upon
united
states
against
california.
a
suit
by
the
united
states
invoking
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court
seeking
ownership
in
the
seabed
in
the
three-mile
belt
adjacent
to
the
coast
of
california.
california
put
an
issue,
the
precise
question
involved
here
by
defending
on
the
claim,
that
the
original
13
states
had
acquired
rights
in
the
seabed.
they
said
three
miles
at
least
in
the
seabed,
it
wasn't
just
a
three-mile
belt
that
they
assert.
and
on
the
atlantic
shore
and
that
california
acquired
a
corresponding
property
interest
on
the
west
coast
because
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
on
equal
footing.
this
court
held
california
not
entitled
to
the
seabed
on
the
ground
that
the
original
13
colonies
which
includes
all
of
the
defendant
states
here
maine
claiming
through
massachusetts
never
acquired
ownership
in
the
three-mile
belt.
justice
black's
opinion
for
the
court
held
that
the
federal
government
rather
than
the
states
have
paramount
sovereignty
and
as
in
instant
to
that
full
dominion
of
the
resources
of
the
soil
under
the
water
area
including
oil.
so
that
the
precise
legal
principle
involves
here
was
decided
in
california.
it
should
also
be
said
that
justice
black
made
the
statement
in
california
that
history
did
not
support
the
claim
that
there
was
any
right
to
ownership
of
the
seabed
established
in
colonial
days.
so,
it
is
not
a
case
decided
as
if
the
court
had
no
evidence
of
ownership
and
title
before
it.
the
court
had
many
of
these
same
documents
before
it
and
made
a
finding
that
state
ownership
had
not
been
shown.
now,
nothing
of
course
turns
upon
the
fact
that
california
involved
the
three-mile
belt
while
this
case
concerns
the
continental
shelf
seaweed
of
the
three-mile
belt
because
of
course
in
united
states
against
louisiana,
the
dispute
was
over
at
27-mile
area
of
the
shore.
and
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
said
if
as
we
held
in
california's
case,
the
three-mile
belt
is
in
the
domain
of
the
nation,
rather
than
that
of
separate
states,
it
follows
a
fortiori
that
the
ocean
beyond
that
limit
also
east.
the
ocean
seaweed
of
the
marginal
belt
is
perhaps
even
more
directly
related
to
the
national
defense
the
conduct
of
the
foreign
affairs
in
world
commerce
than
is
the
marginal
sea
certainly
is
not
less
so.
now,
that
principle
of
course
was
applied
in
united
states
against
texas
as
well
which
was
decided
the
same
way
as
louisiana.
i
should
pause
here
for
a
moment
to
say
that,
i
think
it
is
not
correct
as
counsel
for
the
defense
states
suggest
that
california
was
somehow
in
aberration
in
the
law.
there
was
dictum
in
prior
cases.
they
would
have
suggested
perhaps
state
ownership
of
close
in
waters
but
only
dictums,
the
california
court
pointed
out
as
there
was
those
statements
that
were
too
broad,
the
case
of
the
courts
in
those
cases
were
dealing
usually
with
inland
waters.
and
so
that
there
was
no
law
which
california
suddenly
overturned.
mr.
robert
bork
i've
been
puzzling
over
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
the
decree
gives
dominion
in
full
control
and
so
forth
that
i
think
later
decrees
give
proprietorship
in
this
state
cases.
and
i'm
not
quite
clear
what
the
significance
of
that
striking
of
those
words
is.
we
have
never
quite
to
disturb
what
the
significance
was
and
i
think
later
decrees
do
give
propriety
rights.
now,
these
cases
are
well-established
and
there
are
two
lines
of
attack
that
the
defendants
make
upon
them
in
an
effort
to
get
them
overturned.
the
first
line
of
attack
is
that
these
cases
have
been
repudiated
by
congress
in
the
submerged
lands
act
of
1953,
and
abandoned
by
this
court
when
it
sustained
the
submerged
lands
act.
i
think
there's
nothing
whatever
in
that
notion.
submerged
land
act
and
decisions
under
it
far
from
repudiating
california
in
the
part
of
the
other
cases
it's
upon
adopted
and
proceed
from
it.
the
act
of
course
relinquished
these
very
states,
propriety
rights
within
in
the
three-mile
belt
of
the
atlantic
ocean
but
retained
paramount
federal
powers,
they
defense
commerce
navigation
and
so
forth,
there's
no
mystery
about
that.
congress
ceded
national
property
to
the
coastal
states
something
it
has
a
clear
constitutional
power
to
do
under
article
iv
of
the
constitution
as
this
court
said
in
alabama
--
the
alabama
litigation.
the
defendant
states
attempt
to
make
a
repudiation
of
california
by
attributing
to
california
a
false
rational.
a
rational
that
does
not
i
think
bear.
they
argue
that
california
held
that
or
at
least
that
the
special
master
thought
it
did
that
ownership
of
the
seabed
is
unnecessary
and
indispensable
and
inseparable
attribute
a
federal
constitutional
powers.
hence,
their
separation
by
congress
agreed
to
this
court
--
by
this
court
in
alabama
against
texas
necessarily
repudiates
the
california
rational.
it
is
clear
of
course
that
the
special
master
did
not
read
california
that
way
although
the
states
did
urge
that
meeting
upon
them,
now
the
they
impute
it
to
him,
i
guess
for
the
purpose
of
importing
into
this
court's
california
opinion
a
meaning
that
could
be
said
that
it
be
repudiated
by
the
submerged
land
act.
but
not
a
word
in
the
california
case
or
in
the
special
master's
report
states
that
ownership
of
land
and
governmental
authority
over
it
are
constitutionally
forever
inseparable.
the
court
was
engaged
in
attempting
to
side
ownership
in
an
area
between
two
contending
governments
and
aside
from
the
evidence
of
the
governmental
power
over
the
area,
there
was
no
particular
evidence
of
ownership
in
the
usual
sense
by
either
government.
the
fact
that
one
of
the
government's
had
crucial
governmental
functions
in
the
area,
on
the
other
hand,
very
few
was
reason
enough
to
assign
ownership
to
the
former.
it
would
have
been
quite
wrong
for
this
court
to
decide
how
much
proprietary
interest
is
essential
to
constitutional
function
and
it
refused
it
aside
that
in
the
california
case.
that
is
a
question
for
political
authorities
of
the
government
who
have
the
constitutional
authorities
in
questions
to
decide.
and
in
the
submerged
lands
act,
the
political
authorities
decided
but
the
political
authority,
the
congress
in
this
case
also
decided
to
accept
the
rational
of
california
and
the
explicit
statement
of
louisiana
that
california's
rational
a
fortiori
applied
further
out
to
see
because
it
enacted
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
within
three
months
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
expressly
asserted
federal
ownership
of
resources
in
the
seabed
beyond
the
three-mile
limit.
and
that
claim
rest
upon
the
rational
of
california,
louisiana
and
texas.
it
certainly
does
not
repudiate
it.
and
to
put
the
cap
on
it,
this
court
of
course
stated
in
the
second
louisiana
case
that
the
act,
the
submerged
land
act
concededly
did
not
impair
the
validity
of
california,
louisiana,
and
texas
cases.
and
that
those
cases
were
noticed
to
all
the
coastal
states.
now
defendant's
second
attack
on
this
group
of
cases
is
to
say
that
they
were
wrongly
decided
because
there
is
no
logical
nexus
between
sovereignty
and
ownership.
in
doing
that,
they
adopt
the
stands
of
justice
frankfurter's
dissent
in
the
california
case,
he
assumed,
indeed
he
must
have
found
because
he
was
willing
to
dismiss
the
bill
without
prejudice
that
california
had
not
shown
ownership.
but
he
argued
that
the
united
states
had
not
shown
ownership
either,
because
he
said
imperium
did
not
imply
dominium.
in
that
situation,
said
justice
frankfurter,
the
contested
area
is
to
be
deemed
unclaimed
land
and
that
determination
to
claim
it
on
the
party
of
united
states
is
a
political
decision
not
for
this
court.
and
he
went
on,
“i
have
no
doubt
that
the
president
and
the
congress
between
them
could
make
it
part
of
the
national
domain
and
thereby
bring
it
under
article
iv,
section
3
of
the
constitution.
and
he
would
have
dismissed
the
bill
without
prejudice
to
let
the
political
authorities
of
the
nation
decide
the
ownership
of
the
land
of
the
coast.
in
this
case,
the
political
judgment
that
justice
frankfurter
called
has
been
made.
but
the
submerged
land
act
and
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
congress
has
allocated
a
three-mile
belt
along
the
atlantic
coast
through
this
defendant
states
and
claim
the
remainder
of
the
continental
shelf
for
the
united
states.
so
that
even
under
the
rational
of
justice
frankfurter's
dissent
in
california,
the
united
states
would
be
entitled
to
judgment
here.
but
i
think
the
majority
opinions
in
california,
louisiana,
and
texas
remain
the
law
and
also
completely
foreclosed
the
claims
of
defendants
here.
the
special
master
concluded
that
these
cases
require
as
a
matter
of
law
the
entry
of
judgment
for
the
united
states
on
its
motion.
i
renew
that
motion
here.
the
major
purpose
of
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
is
to
insure
finality
and
certainty,
and
hence
the
rapid
disposition
of
future
cases
involved
in
the
same
issue.
i
would
suggest
it
is
particularly
appropriate
that
the
doctrine
be
applied
here
since
the
leasing
program
mandated
by
congress
in
the
outer
continental
shelf
first
act
and
an
urgent
aspect
of
the
president's
efforts
to
improve
the
energy
situation
must
await
the
outcome
of
this
litigation.
i
think
that
is
the
basis
for
our
motion
for
judgment.
i
think
its
sound,
the
remainder
of
defendant's
arguments
are
attempts
to
undercut
the
historical
foundations
of
the
california
case
by
trying
to
prove
that
they
obtained
title
to
the
seabed
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
in
colonial
times
and
have
retained
it
to
this
day.
well,
that
effort
is
heroic.
but
the
title
they
claim
faces
an
endless
series
of
hurdles,
and
i'm
afraid
to
say
that
i
don't
think
their
arguments
get
over
any
one
of
them.
the
first
difficulty
with
the
states
title
and
i
guess
it
wouldn't
be
proper
to
call
it
a
fatal
difficulty
because
the
first
difficulty
is
that
it
never
existed.
neither
the
english
crown
nor
the
american
colonies
ever
owned
the
seabed
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
in
the
english
law
of
the
period
lends
no
support
to
any
such
claim
of
territorial
sovereignty,
that
conclusion
as
i
say
was
reached
by
the
special
master
here
was
read
by
this
court
in
the
california
case.
as
our
brief
show,
it
was
reached
by
two
justices
of
the
high
court
of
australia.
in
the
case
there,
the
two
justices
who
reached
the
issue
in
that
case
and
it
was
reached
by
the
supreme
court
in
canada
in
a
case
involving
british
columbia's
claims
to
the
offshore
land.
that's
a
rather
awesome
array
of
judges
in
tribunals
who
have
decided
the
defendant's
basic
premise
and
basic
historical
premise
here
is
simply
wrong.
now
the
special
master's
finding
rest
upon
evidentiary
detail
which
is
far
too
copious
to
be
dealt
with
effectively
in
oral
argument.
and
we
will
rely
primarily
upon
this
report
and
upon
our
brief
in
this
court
and
upon
our
opening
in
reply
briefs
before
the
special
master.
and
i
want
to
say,
if
one
gets
into
this
historical
record,
it
is
indispensable
that
the
briefs
before
the
special
master
be
read
because
there
are
endless
historical
disputes
in
this
case.
i
think
i
first
decided
that
the
historical
evidence
did
not
lend
itself
to
extended
oral
presentation
when
i
found
myself
trying
to
distinguish
between
the
various
meanings
that
one
can
attribute
to
robert
coles'
1622
lectures
on
the
statute
of
sewers.
but
i
do
wish
to
say
that
we
did
not
agree
with
the
counsel's
characterization
of
this
case
that
his
case
is
utterly
crystal
clear.
i
think
it
is
utterly
crystal
clear
that
the
evidence
is
dead
against
the
position
here
just
here.
now,
defendant's
brief
is
filled
with
assertions,
fact
as
settled
or
as
conceded
that
are
actually
disputed
in
detail
and
i
want
to
give
one
example.
as
a
matter
of
the
100-mile
limit
of
that
was
said
to
be
the
plain
english
law
of
territorial
sovereignty
over
the
sea,
that
100-mile
territorial
claim,
i'm
afraid
is
a
figment
of
historical
imagination.
we
think
there
are
only
two
cases,
two
instances,
where
it
was
put
forward
in
that
form.
one
was
by
professor
john
tilley
for
doing
the
stuart
era
argued
the
price
case
in
an
english
court.
the
dutch
had
captured
a
spanish
ship,
i
believe
it
was
and
representing
the
spaniards,
professor
john
tilley
urged
the
court
that
the
ships
which
have
been
brought
in
english
port
could
not
priceless
because
they
have
been
taken
with
in
a
hundred
miles
of
the
english
coast
and
that
was
an
area
which
the
english
owned
and
therefore
must
be
respected
as
neutral.
the
court
rejected
the
argument
and
awarded
the
price
as
to
the
captors.
the
only
other
know
evidence
is
the
letter
by
the
earl
of
salisbury,
suggesting
that
an
ambassador
might
make
such
an
argument
to
the
spanish.
that's
all
we
know
about
it.
it's
not
shown
that
anybody
ever
made
such
an
argument.
the
rest
of
these
100-mile
limits
occur
in
a
variety
of
writers
and
there
are
various
limits
suggested
60
miles,
10
miles,
100
miles,
but
it's
quite
clear
if
one
examines
them,
that
it
is
always
a
protective
jurisdiction
which
is
asserted
to
go
out
to
100
miles
not
ownership
of
property,
not
territorial
sovereignty.
it
is
a
jurisdiction
for
purposes
of
protection
against
pirates,
a
regulation
of
navigation
when
it's
important
and
that
sort
of
thing.
it
is
not
a
territorial
claim
so
that
there
is
100-mile
limit
as
we
look
out
very
carefully.
in
the
sense
of
a
territorial
claim
has
only
advanced
seriously
once
that
we
know
of
and
rejected
by
the
court
in
that
case.
in
fact,
it
should
be
said
i
think
that
the
states
case
in
the
sense
rest
upon
historical
case,
rest
upon
a
confusion
between
maritime
jurisdiction
are
claimed
exercise
admiralty
powers
a
protective
concept
of
jurisdiction.
they
are
constantly
confusing
statements
made
in
that
context
with
statements
of
claims
to
ownership
and
that's
where
a
large
part
of
this
case
is
so
confusing.
but
once
that
confusion
is
eliminated,
it
is
seen
that
indeed
there
is
very
little
to
the
states
historical
case.
to
summarize
briefly,
english
law
made
no
claim
to
the
ownership
of
even
the
english
seas
and
the
seabed
during
the
brief
period
--
except
during
the
brief
period
of
stuart
pretensions
from
1603
to
1688.
and
those
claims
vanished
with
the
stuart
dynasty.
certainly,
there
was
no
pretense
to
legal
ownership
by
1776.
moreover,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
event
the
stuart's
claimed
ownership
of
any
part
of
the
american
seas
much
less
the
seabed
of
the
american
outer
continental
shelf.
the
stuart's
claims
to
ownership
in
english
seas
rested
quite
simply
upon
naval
domination
that
was
never
approached
in
the
american
seas.
and
here
again
is
a
source
of
confusion
in
this
case.
we
hear
of
talk
about
claims
to
fisheries
or
sedentary
fisheries.
of
course,
there
were
claims
because
it
was
then
established
that
one
could
get
property
rights
in
an
area
of
the
sea
or
in
the
seabed
by
effective
proscription
and
occupation.
and
if
you
work,
the
oyster
bed
for
period
of
time
and
fence
out
foreign
fishermen
you
had
established
ownership
in
the
sense,
but
only
to
the
area
which
you
occupied
and
only
to
the
fishery
as
to
which
you
had
a
right
of
proscription.
and
so
disputes
about
fisheries
here
show
very
little
about
the
claim
of
broad
territorial
sovereignty.
english
--
the
english
vest
never
had
ownership
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
that
could
be
passed
on
to
the
americans
and
as
the
special
master
found
the
colonial
charters
did
not
grant
such
rights.
head
english
title
existed
as
an
attribute
of
governmental
power
and
had
it
been
passed
in
some
form
to
the
colonies.
that
ownership
would
have
revered
to
the
crown
before
american
independence
because
it
is
quite
clear
that
by
1754,
all
but
three
colonies
had
become
royal
colonies
and
were
governed
directly
by
the
crown
and
as
to
the
others,
most
of
their
governmental
powers
had
in
fact
reverted.
the
crown
repeatedly
disposed
of
vacant
and
unappropriated
lands
in
the
colonies
without
regard
to
the
boundaries
set
out
in
the
original
charters.
a
charter
grant
of
lands
was
merely
a
grant
of
an
opportunity
to
establish
settlements
and
to
appropriate
land.
as
incidence
to
government
and
if
the
land
was
not
settled
or
appropriated
even
though
it
was
in
the
grant,
the
crown
would
sometimes
take
it
back
or
reallocated.
in
most
cases,
in
most
powers
--
in
many
cases
all
powers
had
reverted
to
the
crown
by
the
eve
of
independence.
and
this
was
especially
the
case
with
respect
to
maritime
ladders
which
were
governed
ultimately
from
england.
so
that
even
if
the
three
colonies
that
had
not
become
royal
colonies
lost
any
dominion
over
the
sea
which
they
might
they
conceivably
have
gained
as
attribute
of
external
sovereignty.
it's
perfectly
clear
i
think
that
there
were
no
seabed
rights
in
the
colonies
on
the
eve
of
independence
and
the
master
so
found.
but
this
is
by
no
means
the
end
of
the
difficulties
with
defendant's
case.
it
should
be
assumed
for
the
sake
of
argument.
and
i
think
it
is
only
for
the
sake
of
argument.
that
this
court,
the
special
master
and
the
australian
and
canadian
judges
have
all
been
wrong
about
english
law.
and
hence
defendant's
alone
correct,
i
think
there
are
two
propositions
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
established
the
right
of
united
states
to
judgment
here
and
i
pass
to
this
now.
special
master
found
that
if
there
were
title
to
the
seabed
in
either
the
colonies
or
the
english
crown,
such
rights
passed
united
states
at
independence
on
july
4,
1776
or
the
latest
upon
ratification
of
the
constitution
in
1789.
there
never
was
a
time
when
any
of
these
dates
existed
as
independent
sovereignties
with
external
powers
of
government.
the
national
government
was
formed
and
was
in
operation
prior
to
the
existence
of
any
state.
the
special
master
said,
“i
find
that
upon
the
establishment
of
the
first
continental
congress
in
1774,
the
united
states
of
america
emerged.”
and
i
--
mr.
robert
bork
i
would
indeed.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
think
as
the
special,
in
this
conclusion
as
i
recall
the
special
master
takes
as
the
two
effective
dates
when
the
rights
the
seabed
if
any
had
existed
would
have
pass
to
the
federal
government
as
independence
and
ratification
of
the
constitution.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
there
isn't
in
this
report
a
suggestion
that
one
could
equally
have
chosen
to
addition
dates.
one
would
be
the
formation
of
the
first
continental
congress
and
the
acts
for
the
second
and
the
governing
power
that
they
assume
immediately.
the
other
i
suppose
would
have
been
the
treaty
of
piece,
1783.
but
it's
important
i
think
to
realize
--
it's
important
i
think
to
realize
just
what
the
history
of
that
period
was.
one
of
our
witnesses,
professor
richard
morris
has
written
an
article
consisting
largely
of
matters
he
said
in
his
testimony
and
i
think
that
perhaps
in
excessive
sense
of
delicacy
we
did
not
say,
theoretically
in
our
brief,
being
less
delicate,
i
would
like
permission
to
cite
it
now.
it
appears
in
the
columbia
law
review
volume
74,
number
6,
as
october
1974
in
which
he
considers
the
historical
evidence
about
the
forming
of
the
union
and
it's
pretty
quite
plain.
it's
also
in
his
testimony.
it's
also
quite
plain
that
a
national
government
was
formed
with
the
first
constitution
--
first
continental
congress.
representative
were
chosen
by
the
people
of
the
colonies
and
not
by
the
colonial
governments
except
in
one
instance.
mr.
robert
bork
twelve
were
represented
in
the
first,
i
believe
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
robert
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
i
think
it
was
georgia.
i
hear
georgia
being
--
mr.
robert
bork
i
had
myself
being
supported
in
the
georgia
claim.
mr.
robert
bork
i
think
georgia
submitted
to
its
--
to
the
jurisdiction
and
the
power
of
the
first
continental
congress
and
in
that
sense,
i
think
was
bound
and
certainly
came
into
the
second
continental
congress.
but
i'm
describing
a
period
before
independence
in
which
the
continental
congress
initiated
the
formation
of
the
states
by
resolution.
first
at
ad
hoc
and
then
by
general
resolution
calling
for
state
governments.
the
continental
congress
issued
the
declaration
of
independence
and
in
fact,
the
declaration
is
in
its
own
terms
said
to
be
a
declaration
by
the
representatives
of
the
united
states
of
america
in
general
congress
assembled.
and
during
this
period
of
time
the
continental
congress
took
jurisdiction
over
admiralty
cases
away
in
the
sense
that
it
would
hear
appeals
from
state
courts
to
a
committee
of
congress
and
asserted
jurisdiction
to
make
treaties
where
foreign
powers
are
dead,
assume
the
powers
of
war
and
peace,
even
passed
laws
about
treason
requiring
allegiance
to
the
united
states
government
not
to
the
state
government.
so
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
there
was
a
national
government
operating
and
claiming
legal
powers
and
exercising
legal
powers
before
the
states
had
fairly
become
into
existence.
mr.
robert
bork
i
think
there
was
some
--
i
think
there
was
no
successful
effort
at
that.
i
think
russia
and
some
other
countries
have
attempted
at
one
point
to
deal
with
the
states
individually.
mr.
robert
bork
well,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
bork
i
think
--
mr.
robert
bork
i
think
--
mr.
robert
bork
i
think
it
was
quite
clear
even
so
before
that
mr.
justice
stewart
that
united
states
insisted
upon
speaking
for
the
states
and
not
letting
the
states
run
their
own
foreign
policy.
i
think
diplomatic
--
a
diplomatic
experience
from
1776
on
shows
that.
mr.
robert
bork
first
mission
abroad?
i
don't
know
and
i
was
wondering
if
they
had
similar
help
from
the
bench
here.
i
don't
know
the
firs
mission
abroad
that
they
authorize.
but
they
did
--
in
1775
the
continental
congress
addressed
messages
to
the
governments
of
europe
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
bork
certainly,
the
peace
treaty
of
1783
with
england
was
negotiated
on
behalf
of
the
entire
united
states
and
claimed
fisheries
which
seemed
to
loom
large
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
entire
united
states
the
american
people
not
on
behalf
of
any
state.
fisheries
offer
a
coast.
mr.
robert
bork
i
have
no
doubt
mr.
justice
stewart
that
internal
--
mr.
robert
bork
that
is
quite
true.
i
think
the
coning
of
money
is
not
example
that
bears
upon
this
case
and
the
other
thing
the
states
did
such
as
erecting
--
mr.
robert
bork
they
--
i
think
they
had
a
thought
that
they
were
absolutely
sovereign
internally
in
internal
matters.
i
think
they
did
not
have
the
same
thought
with
respect
to
diplomatic
matters
and
speaking
abroad.
i
think
the
united
states
almost
without
exception
congress
had
sent
people
abroad
who
dealt
for
the
united
states.
mr.
robert
bork
i
don't
mean
to
argument?
mr.
robert
bork
no,
no,
i
think
said
it
doesn't.
i
was
merely
pointing
out
that
i
think
there
are
other
dates
even
earlier
than
independence
by
which
a
national
government
was
in
existence
and
had
external
powers
and
precluded
the
states
from
dealing
independently
and
i
will
make
the
claim
the
states,
mr.
justice
stewart
i
think
never
made
a
claim
any
of
them
to
be
recognized
as
independent
nations
in
international
law.
mr.
robert
bork
well,
i
think
it
did
in
this
sense.
for
example,
there
was
repeated
disputes
about
whether
or
not
congress
could
take
and
review
admiralty
cases
decided
in
state
courts.
this
was
before
the
independence
are
left
after
independence.
and
the
states
involved
said
no,
and
congress
said
yes
and
did
review
them
and
did
reverse
state
decisions.
and
congress
made
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
stick
before
independence
or
right
on
time
of
independence.
i
think
it
was
before
---
i
was
asked
the
question
before
whether
it
was
the
first
commission
and
i
am
informed
the
first
commission
was
to
britain
before
1776
and
that
jefferson
–
thomas
jefferson
was
a
representative.
but
this
argument
about
when
we
became
a
nation
i
think
is
not
essential
to
my
argument.
i
just
–
i
think
it
is
prior
independence.
in
any
case,
aside
from
the
historical
evidence
is
quite
this
court
in
penhallow
against
doane.
by
the
way
a
finding
of
this
court,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
new
hampshire
did
not
possess
admiralty
jurisdiction
during
the
revolutionary
war
on
the
ground
that
congress
representing
the
states
was
sovereign
in
external
affairs.
so
that
it
is
--
i
think
judicial
authority
as
well
as
historical
argument.
and
of
course,
it
is
well
known
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
curtiss-wright
corporation.
this
court
held
that
determined
that
external
sovereignty
had
passed
directly
from
the
british
crowns
of
the
united
states
and
had
never
lodge
in
the
individual
states.
that
dominion
follows
sovereignty
as
well
settled
in
some
of
the
cases
we
discussed
because
the
state
right
the
seabed
under
the
inland
waters
in
fact
were
decisions
had
said
dominion
in
the
states
follows
the
sovereignty
of
the
states.
the
report
of
the
special
master
here
deals
fully
with
a
stop.
they
cannot
and
shall
not
labor
it
further
but
we
have
this
penhallow
against
doane
and
united
states
against
curtiss-wright
corporation
and
other
decisions.
so
i
think
its
aside
from
historical
evidence
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
here
requires
judgment
of
united
states
as
well.
now
i
think
at
the
latest
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
in
1789
would
have
conferred
this
ownership
upon
the
united
states.
i
tend
to
think
it
occurred
myself
in
1774
but
i
don't
think
anything
in
this
case
turns
upon
that
and
therefore
i
will
not
press
that
point.
finally,
i
will
assume
for
my
final
point,
i
will
assume
that
the
state
ownership
of
the
continental
shelf
once
existed
and
somehow
survived
the
series
of
traumatizing
events
that
we've
discussing.
it
is
then
clear
i
think
that
united
states
when
it
adopted
early
in
its
history
the
three-mile
limits
and
certainly
went
it
took
a
lead
among
nations
in
getting
that
limit
established
as
international
understating
united
states
by
that
act
renounced
sovereignty
in
the
adjacent
seas
and
seabed
outside
the
three-mile
limits
and
it
is
quite
clear
this
counsel
for
the
defendant
states
has
said,
united
states
in
international
matters
may
cede
part
of
the
states
territory
without
the
states
consent
on
its
boundary.
if
it
is
citing
in
foreign
relationship
and
international
matters
and
the
special
master
so
concluded
that
that
act
would
have
cut
off
any
surviving
state
claim
to
any
part
of
the
seabed.
now,
the
three-mile
limit
was
maintained
and
enforced
until
1945
when
president
truman
of
course
claimed
the
continental
shelf
and
in
1953
congress
claimed
the
resources
outside
the
three-mile
limit
for
the
united
states
as
against
the
states
and
as
the
california
decision
held,
the
assertion
of
national
dominion
over
the
sea
and
seabed
is
binding
upon
this
court.
it
follows
from
this
history
that
any
rights
the
states
may
have
once
have
or
extinguished
with
adoption
of
the
three-mile
limit
and
federal
rights
were
later
created.
and
these
series
of
events
i
think
standing
alone
is
sufficient
to
require
judgment
of
united
states.
i
suppose
i
should
say
a
word
about
the
equitable
argument
made
by
counsel
for
united
states
that
only
a
judgment
for
his
clients
will
allow
sharing
in
the
proceeds.
i
think
that's
not
correct
conceptually
because
i
take
it
the
judgment
for
the
united
states
will
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
entire
united
states
which
is
a
form
of
sharing
a
different
allocation
in
the
share
perhaps
but
in
addition
to
that,
it
is
worth
saying
that
congress
has
previously
responded
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
by
giving
this
defendant
states
certain
rights.
there
are
proposals
on
congress
for
that
kind
of
allocation
of
revenues
perhaps
i
don't
know
if
the
proposal
will
pass
but
they
are
being
considered
should
united
states
prevail
in
this
litigation
to
share
the
revenues
with
the
states.
i
have
argued
for
proposition
which
i
think
each
independently
requires
judgment
to
the
united
states.
i
respectfully
urged
that
if
it
can
be
done,
united
states
motion
for
judgment
be
granted.
because
there
is
an
urgent
need
to
have
this
cloud
on
title
settled.
so
that
in
one
ownership
or
another
development
of
the
long
process
or
development
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
fore
emergency
needs
can
begin.
mr.
robert
bork
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
as
i
try
to
touch
upon
the
--
this
court
certainly
didn't
think
so
because
after
the
submerged
land
act,
this
court
said
that
in
the
second
louisiana
case
that
the
california
decision
may
not
impair
it.
in
addition
to
that,
i
take
it
that
the
connection
between
sovereignty
and
ownership
in
the
california
case
is
not
inseparable,
it
just
inseparable
by
this
court.
the
political
authorities
having
the
sovereignty
and
the
political
power
that
is
congress
and
the
president
having
the
external
sovereignty
in
their
hands
may
make
a
decision,
a
political
decision,
how
much
ownership
is
necessary
to
the
exercise
of
that
sovereignty.
and
they
have
made
political
decision.
i
don't
think
that
impairs
the
california
case
in
any
way.
