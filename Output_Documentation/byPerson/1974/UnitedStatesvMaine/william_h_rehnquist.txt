you
say
that
even
though
property
rights
may
have
existed
outside
the
three-mile
limit,
the
federal
government
and
its
foreign
affairs
power
can
cut
them
off?
justice
william

will
they
have

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
federal
government
have
more
authority
over
the
shelf
resources
than
it
would
over
land
resources
that
were
the
property
of
the
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
dominion,
do
you
mean
in
the
sense
of
property
ownership?
justice

mr.
solicitor
general,
what
do
you
make
of
justice
frankfurter's
comment
in
the
texas
case
that
in
california,
the
court
did
amend
the
proposed
decree
submitted
by
the
government
to
strike
out
the
terms
of
proprietorship?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
all
13
states
represented
in
the
first
continental
congress?
justice
william

which
was

it?

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
georgia
be
bound
in
by
whatever
the
first
continental
congress
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
say
that
continental
congress
precluded
the
states
from
dealing
independently?
i
think
probably
you
can
make
a
strong
historical
argument
that
continental
congress
did
deal
for
the
state.
but
it
had
no
authority
of
anything
coming
from
the
present
congress
over
the
individual
states,
did
it?
