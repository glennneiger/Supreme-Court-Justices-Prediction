the
pages
mr.
clagett,
beginning
when
and
where?
justice
potter
stewart
beginning
with
the
cross-examination
of
mr.
cavignon?
justice
potter
stewart
where
did
you
get
10
leagues?
i
thought
it
was
three
leagues.
justice
potter
stewart
nine
nautical
miles?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
we're
talking
about
nautical
miles
are
only
true
here,
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
as
versus
three
nautical
miles.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
never
10
miles?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
charters
are
we
talking
about?
justice
potter
stewart
over,
over
what
period?
justice
potter
stewart
so
well
over
a
hundred
years.
justice
potter
stewart
total?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
also
just
the
de
facto
control
of
the
british
navy?
justice

james
--
justice
potter
stewart
james
the
first?
justice
potter
stewart
during
the
reign
of
1603
--
1625,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
a
sedentary
fishery
is?
justice
potter
stewart
fish?
justice
potter
stewart
the
last
point
has
mis
eluded
me.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
various
in
other
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
maritime
commerce
is
the
one.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
solicitor
general,
this
is
way
out
of
order
and
--
but
i
was
wondering
while
in
it's
my
mind,
do
you
agree
with
your
brother
on
the
other
side
as
to
further
proceedings
in
this
court,
no
matter
--
the
further
proceedings
in
this
case
no
matter
how
this
court
decides
the
present?
justice
potter
stewart
drawing
lines
in
the
future?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
clagett
specifically
said
that
in
his
view,
we
should
not
retain
jurisdiction
of
this
case
as
we
have
in
previous
similar
cases
but
that
instead,
this
line
drawing
however
it's
the
side
of
year
could
be
carried
out
by
the
district
courts
which
jurisdictions
since
when
1972
was
up,
and
you
haven't
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
haven't
been
will
take
a
position
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
also
true
mr.
solicitor
general
that
in
the
period
after
1776
and
before
the
ratification
of
the
constitution
that
at
least
some
of
the
states
were
purporting
or
trying
to
carryon
their
own
foreign
policies?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
that
really
one
of
the
very
basic
reasons
for
the
constitutional
convention
in
philadelphia?
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
that
one
of
the
big
problems?
and
wasn't
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
basic
accomplishments
of
the
constitution
of
the
foreign
policy
of
this
newly
independent
united
or
partly
united
newly
independent
states
and
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
eastern
shore
of
the
north
american
continental
to
put
the
foreign
affairs
into
one
sovereignty
rather
than
keeping
the
13?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
states
were
--
not
only
as
i
say
making
moves
toward
carryon
along
foreign
policies
regardless
of
what
the
continental
congress
might
have
also
been
doing
and
also
they
were
coining
money
and
asserting
other
aspects
of
absolute
sovereignty
were
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
in
the
sixth
grade
that's
the
reason
they
sent
their
people
to
philadelphia
in
a
hot
summer
by
a
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
what
happen
to
the
sovereignty
though
or
it
was
their
thought
that
they
were?
justice
potter
stewart
which
act,
the
outer
continental
shelf
act?
justice
potter
stewart
both
acts
taken
together?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
something
to
the
contrary
in
the
curtiss-wright
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
that's
wrong?
you
too?
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
the
three-mile
limit
association?
