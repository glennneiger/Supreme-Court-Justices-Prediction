justice
byron
r.
white
in
1945
or
whenever
it
was,
that
the
united
states
claims
it
first
acquired
title
or
interest
in
the
shelf.
what
if
the
united
states
at
the
time
had
owned
a
hundred
miles
of
the
coastline
just
as,
say
it
with
100
miles
because
the
coastline
was
part
of
the
public
domain?
let's
just
assume.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
no
just
as
part
of
the
public
demand.
and
the
united
states
just
happen
to
own
it,
that's
all.
it
was
within
the
state
but
it
just
happened
to
own
100
miles
of
the
coastline.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
the
state
acquire
any
interests
in
the
shelf
under
your
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
rather
than
a
private
owner?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
thought
of
conveying
away
part
of
the
coastline
is
some
other
country?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
it's
just
because
it
was
a
sovereign
rather
than
a
private
owner?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
court
of
canada?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
you
agreed
it's
not
just
an
argument
about
property
law
but
about
sovereignty.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
the
point
(inaudible)
no
single
state
in
the
united
states
to
get
i
mean,
declaration
before
we
entered
prior
to
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
hope
that
you're
suggesting
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
historically.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
acquire
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
before
anything,
the
question
will
be
on
your
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
then
requires
the
expression
of
the
sovereignty
of
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
but
the
only
effective
declaration
in
the
united
states
is
the
best
kind
of
the
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
separate
places?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
that
with
the
case
in
the
event
we
decide
for
you?
so
assume
we
overrule
california?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
the
other
case
not
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
for
example
mr.
solicitor
general,
is
there
any
baseline
question
on
this?
if
the
federal
government
prevails
here,
are
there
baseline
questions
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
this
case
presented?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
now
reach
in
this
case,
as
the
special
master
inquired
on
those
issues
if
the
federal
government
prevails,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
in
the
original
action
brought
by
the
united
states
against
13
of
the
states
with
coast
lines
on
the
atlantic
ocean.
the
issue
is
the
ownership
of
the
seabed
of
the
continental
shelf
lying
outside
the
three
mile
limit
within
which
the
seabed
has
been
granted
to
the
states
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
the
complaint
of
the
united
states
alleges
federal
title
to
these
lands
in
question
and
there's
a
dispute
about
it
in
the
states.
the
states
answered
denying
the
title
of
the
united
states
and
claiming
title
for
themselves.
we
appointed
albert
maris
as
special
master
and
referred
the
case
to
him.
the
special
master
then
severed
the
--
or
recommended
that
the
case
against
florida
be
severed
and
consolidated
with
other
proceedings
and
we
agreed
with
him
in
that
respect.
the
special
master
then
took
extensive
evidence
and
has
now
filed
his
report.
the
united
states
accepts
the
report
in
all
respects.
the
states
however
have
filed
a
brief
and
orally
argued
a
rather
extensive
exceptions.
the
report
of
the
special
master
recommends
that
the
court
enter
a
judgment
for
the
united
states.
it's
his
view
and
has
been
his
been
view
and
it's
his
view
that
the
case
is
completely
controlled
by
united
states
against
california
decided
in
1947
and
by
the
two
cases
that
followed
it,
united
states
against
louisiana
and
united
states
against
texas.
we
have
considered
the
report
and
the
exceptions
and
we
agree
with
the
special
master.
we
think
that
the
case
indeed
is
controlled
by
our
three
prior
cases
and
that
united
states
under
those
cases
is
entitled
to
judgment.
although
the
states
have
made
admirable
efforts
to
persuade
us
that
that
those
cases
should
be
overruled,
we
declined
to
disturb
them.
our
reasons
for
our
conclusions
are
given
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk.
and
as
i
say,
we
have
concluded
the
judgment
to
be
on
the
united
states
and
it
is
so
ordered.
mr.
justice
douglas
took
no
part
in
the
decision
or
consideration
of
the
case.
