mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
pleases
the
court.
in
1968,
this
court
in
king
versus
smith
held
that
the
social
security
act
prohibited
the
state
of
alabama
from
denying
needy
and
dependent
children
of
afdc
assistance
because
the
caretaker
relative
associated
where
the
person
had
no
legal
obligation
to
support
the
children
and
who
in
fact
provided
no
support.
this
court
held
that
the
alabama
substitute
parent
rule
in
effect
defined
the
term
“parent”
in
a
manner
that
consisted
with
section
606
(a)
of
the
social
security
act,
and
left
alabama's
needy
and
dependent
children
without
meaningful
protection.
the
new
york
lodger
or
the
so
called
lodger,
has
the
same
relevant
characteristics
as
alabama
substitute
parent.
he
is
also
a
person
who
has
no
legal
obligation
to
support
the
family.
he
is
also
a
person
who
has
in
fact
provided
no
support.
both
the
alabama
rule
and
the
new
york
rule
operate
without
regard
to
the
family's
actual
needs.
the
only
difference
between
the
substitute
parent
rule
in
king
versus
smith,
and
the
new
york
lodger
rule,
is
that
whereas
alabama
completely
denied
afdc
children
--
afdc
assistance.
the
new
york
rule
works
a
reduction
in
the
afdc
grant
because
the
caretaker
relative
has
chosen
to
allow
another
person
to
reside
in
the
home.
we
submit
that
this
court
in
king
versus
smith
did
not
imply,
and
we
submit
did
not
intend
that
needy
and
dependent
children
can
be
denied
part
of
their
afdc
assistance
based
upon
the
fiction
that
their
needs
have
diminished
because
the
caretaker
relative
associates
with
the
person
who
has
the
same
characteristics
as
the
substitute
parent
in
king
versus
smith.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
think
that
if
new
york
had
a
rule
that
was
based
upon
an
assessment
of
the
space
needed
for
the
family,
and
if
in
fact
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
i
have
to
disagree
with
that
characterization
your
honor.
i
say
that
from
an
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
he
is
not
paying
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
he
is
not
paying
for
it,
but
the
state,
when
it
initially
computes
the
family
shelter
allowance
has
computed
the
amount
of
shelter
allowance
that
the
state
itself
has
determined
is
necessary
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
afdc
family.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
i
think
it's
clear
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
that
is
so
by
definition.
of
course,
it's
not
so.
we
cannot
assume
that
the
lodger
was
using
a
prorata
share
of
the
apartment.
i
mean,
he
maybe
as
judge
oakes
pointed
out
dissenting
in
the
court
of
appeals,
he
maybe
sleeping
in
a
hallway,
he
maybe
sharing
a
bed
in
another
room.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
i
can
have
no
quarrel
with
that
–
[attempt
to
laughter]
that
the
states
however
may
not
reduce
the
afdc
grant
solely
because
the
caretaker
relative
has
invited
another
person
into
the
home
is
substantiated,
both
by
the
regulation
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
which
was
promulgated
subsequent
to
this
court's
decision
in
king,
and
which
was
designed
to
implement
the
decision
in
king,
and
that
regulation
is
now
section
233.90
(a)
of
the
code
of
federal
rules
and
regulations,
title
45
and
secondly,
by
this
court's
decision
in
lewis
versus
martin,
which
upheld
the
validity
of
this
hew
regulation.
now,
this
regulation
in
essence
provides
that
the
inclusion
in
the
afdc
family,
where
the
presence
in
the
home
of
any
person
other
than
a
person
who
has
a
legal
obligation
to
support
the
afdc
family
is
in
the
words
of
the
regulation,
not
an
acceptable
basis
for
a
finding
of
an
eligibility,
which
would
be
basically
a
codification
of
the
holding
in
king,
the
regulation
goes
on,
or
as,
or
for
assuming
the
availability
of
income
by
the
state.
i
submit
that
this
regulation
was
designed
to
ensure
that
needy
and
dependent
children
are
not
denied
and
do
not
receive
a
reduced
grant
of
assistance,
solely
because
the
caretaker
relative
has
invited
a
person
without
a
legal
obligation
of
supporting
to
the
home.
indeed,
this
court's
decision
in
lewis
versus
martin
makes
it
clear
that
the
state
cannot
reduce
the
grant,
even
where
the
person
residing
in
the
home
has
some
legal
obligation
of
support,
but
way
this
legal
obligation
is
something
less
than
that
of
a
natural
parent,
and
secondly,
even
where
the
person
residing
in
the
home
has
available
income.
so,
we
submit
that
what
new
york
is
attempting
to
do
here
is
to
accomplish
by
the
double
assumption
that
(a)
the
so
called
lodger
has
available
income,
and
(b),
is
applying
the
assumed
available
income
to
meet
the
family's
needs,
even
though
lewis
versus
martin
in
section
233.90
will
prohibit
the
states
from
even
assuming
that
income
which
the
lodger
in
fact
has
is
available
to
meet
the
family's
needs.
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
regulations
in
fact
are
based
upon
the
assumption
that
the
so
called
lodger
is
paying
his
share
of
the
rent.
first
of
all,
the
lodger
regulations
themselves
are
on
their
face
state
that
the
available
income
and
resources
of
the
so
called
lodger
shall
be
and
applied
in
accordance
with,
and
then
comes
a
reference
to
proration
in
the
grant
and
in
addition,
the
lodger
regulations
on
their
face
deem
the
person
residing
in
the
home
to
be
a
lodger.
now
the
term
lodger,
i
submit
connotes
a
person
who
is
paying
his
part
of
the
rent.
in
addition,
i
think
the
operation
of
the
regulation
substantiate
that
they
are
based
on
the
assumption
that
the
lodger
is
paying
his
part
of
the
rent.
the
family's
rental
obligation
is
of
course
fixed
initially
by
its
agreement
with
the
landlord,
and
the
defendants
themselves
compute
the
family's
shelter
allowance
in
a
manner
that
is
designed
to
reflect
and
meet
the
shelter
needs
of
the
afdc
family
unit,
which
in
most
cases
would
mean
a
shelter
allowance
efficient
to
meet
its
actual
rental
obligation.
now,
these
shelter
needs
and
rental
obligation
do
not
automatically
decrease
of
course
by
the
fact
that
a
caretaker
relative
has
invited
another
person
to
reside
in
the
home.
they
would
only
decrease
if
the
person
invited
into
the
home
in
fact
pays
part
of
the
rent.
but
i
submit
that
it
is
this
assumption
of
payment
by
the
lodger,
which
is
the
very
assumption
of
payment
which
is
prohibited
by
this
court's
decision
in
lewis
versus
martin
and
by
section
233.90.
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
new
york
in
fact,
as
one
of
its
predecessor
regulations
to
the
present
lodger
regulation,
had
a
regulation
that
queue
conflicted
with
lewis
versus
martin,
and
it
is
set
out
in
full
in
our
brief
at
page
43,
i
will
not
take
the
time
of
the
court
to
read
that.
the
reduction
in
the
grant
is
not
based
upon
any
assessment
by
the
state
that
the
family
shelter
needs
have
decreased,
and
i
think,
this
is
brought
out
by
the
dialog
between
mr.
justice
marshall
and
my
adversary,
and
it's
clear
that
if
the
lodger
moved
out
of
the
home,
the
full
shelter
allowance
would
be
restored.
in
addition,
if
the
family
moved
to
a
smaller
apartment,
no
matter
how
small
this
new
apartment
was,
no
matter
how
low
the
rent
was
in
the
second
apartment,
the
defendants
would
continue
to
provide
a
prorated
share
of
the
rent.
i
think
this
is
made
clear
by
the
factual
situation
of
one
of
the
applicants
for
intervention,
loretta
claque,
that
she
lives
with
her
five
children.
so,
it's
a
family
of
six,
and
their
rental
expense
and
obligation
is
$75.00
per
month,
which
is
certainly
i
think
a
minimal
amount
for
a
family
of
six.
but
because
mrs.
claque
has
invited
another
person
to
reside
in
the
claque
household,
the
state
continues
to
provide
a
reduced
amount
to
meet
their
shelter
needs.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
that
is
a
characterization
i
say.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
judge
oakes
dissenting
in
the
court
of
appeals,
made
the
point
that
the
lodger
is
not
the
beneficiary
of
any
funds
from
the
state.
he
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
generosity
of
the
afdc
family.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
submit
that
the
afdc
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
the
state
initially
provides
the
funds
for
the
rent,
but
that
rental
allowance
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
submit
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
would
the
lodger
be
there,
is
that
the
question?
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
assume
that
the
family
would
be
some
place.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
agree
that
wherever
they
are
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
indirectly
your
honor,
the
person
residing
in
the
home
is
getting
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
i
submit
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
first,
if
the
lodger
were
a
relative,
which
is
one
possibility
for
example
as
reflected
in
the
taylor
situation,
and
it
is
also
reflected
in
the
otay
situation,
the
state
of
new
york
i
believe
it
would
be
within
its
police
powers
as
the
state
of
california
in
lewis
versus
martin
to
enact
of
statute
which
would
provide
for
an
obligation
of
support
by
that
relative.
that's
one
possibility.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
now
i
think
the
question
is
more
difficult
if
the
person
is
a
non
relative.
the
possibility
rises
that
the
state
may
be
able
to
proceed
against
the
lodger
to
collect
part
of
the
rent.
of
course,
that
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i'm
only
of
course,
hypothesizing
the
state
could
possibly
and
i'm
not
conceding
the
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i'm
not
conceding
the
validity
of
such
a
statute,
but
i'm
saying
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
no.
i'm
saying,
i'm
not
making
that
concession.
i'm
just
looking
at
the
state
possibilities.
but
i
think
that
under
the
money
payment
principle,
once
the
state
provides
a
grant
to
the
public
assistance
family,
the
money
payment
principle
guarantees
that
family
freedom
of
choice
in
expending
that
grant
up
to
the
point
i
would
say
that
the
children
are
being
harmed.
i
think
it
also
has
to
be
realized
that
the
person
in
the
home
in
king
versus
smith
and
lewis
versus
martin
were
also
getting
those
benefits
and
comforts
that
anyone
who
may
reside
in
the
home
of
another
would
receive.
but
this
court
held
that
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act
which
are
designed
to
protect
the
children
and
to
prevent
harm
from
the
children
would
override
any
incidental
free
ride,
which
i
suppose
i
would
have
to
concede
that
this
lodger
is
obtaining.
but
i
submit,
it
is
the
same
free
ride
that
the
person
in
the
home
in
king
versus
smith
and
lewis
versus
martin
was
receiving.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
the
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
i
think
the
key
to
king
versus
smith
relates
not
so
much
to
the
technical
use
of
the
term.
parent
in
section
606
(a)
even
though
that
was
the
precise
holding
of
the
court,
but
to
the
question
of
whether
the
children
were
deprived
of
parental
support,
and
i
think
that
was
really
the
key
issue.
and
of
course
in
lewis
versus
martin,
the
state
of
california
was
saying
essentially
the
same
thing
that
the
state
of
new
york
is
saying
here.
they
were
saying
that
since
this
man
is
residing
in
the
home,
this
man
should
take
on
the
obligation
of
supporting
the
children.
he
is
getting
the
benefits
of
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
yes.
but
i'm
saying
it's
a
very
similar
theory
to
that
--
to
the
theory
that
the
state
of
california
had
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
now,
i
recognize
the
differences.
i'm
just
saying
that
the
state
of
california
was
saying
something
similar.
they
were
saying
“you
are
here
residing
in
the
home,
you're
getting
benefit
from
being
part
of
the
family.
therefore,
because
of
those
instances,
you
should
take
on
an
obligation
to
provide
support
to
the
family
up
to
the
amount
of
you
available
income.”
in
this
case,
new
york
is
saying
“because
the
lodger
is
in
the
home,
he
is
getting
the
benefits
in
the
home.
the
lodger
should
pay
his
share
of
the
rent.”
but
i
submit
this
assumption
of
payment
is
specifically
prohibited
by
the
social
security
act
section
602
(a)
(7),
and
certainly
by
section
233.90
of
the
hew
regulations.
on
the
constitutional
issues,
the
lodger
regulations
also
create
a
conclusive
presumption
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
that
whenever
there
is
a
lodger
in
the
home,
this
person
is
able
to
and
is
in
fact,
paying
a
prorata
share
of
the
family's
rental
obligation.
the
regulation
works
substantial
takings
of
profiting
in
the
forms
of
substantial
reductions
in
the
family's
public
assistance
grant,
and
therefore
come
within
the
purview
of
the
due
process
clause.
to
this
court's
recent
decisions
hold
that
it
violates
the
due
process
clause
for
the
state
to
work
or
taking
of
property
on
the
basis
of
conclusive,
we
presume
facts
when
the
conclusive
we
presume
facts
are
of
the
type
that
the
state
statutory
scheme
purports
to
be
concern
with.
in
here,
the
new
york
statutory
scheme
purports
to
meet
100%
of
the
needs
of
all
of
its
recipients.
it
purports
to
meet
the
full
shelter
obligation
of
all
of
its
recipients.
it
purports
to
be
concerned
with
the
actual
needs,
the
actual
resources,
the
actual
income
of
each
of
its
recipients.
and
indeed,
the
lodger
regulations
themselves
on
their
face
purport
to
be
concerned
with
the
lodger's
available
income
and
resources,
which
may
in
fact
not
even
exist,
and
with
actual
contribution
by
the
lodger.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
yes.
i
think
they
can.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
alright.
first
of
all,
i
think
what
they
can
do
is
reflected
in
this
court's
decision
wyman
versus
james
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
case
work
or
visit,
is
to
provide
a
safeguard
against
this
type
of
abuse.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
right.
as
they
say,
under
wyman
versus
james
is
possibility
of
case
work
services,
to
prevent
this
type
of
divestiture
of
the
grant
from
continuing.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
now
of
course,
this
court
in
wyman
versus
james
said
that
the
recipient
cannot
make
that
assertion.
at
least,
with
the
recipient
cannot
say
that
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
the
state
can.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
no
because
that
would
conflict
with
our
assertions
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
of
the
rights
of
privacy
and
association.
however,
the
state
could
make
restricted
payments,
or
provide
voucher
payments
to
the
family.
in
other
words
if
there
was
a
problem
as
to
whether
the
rental
allowance
was
in
fact
being
met
to
meet
the
rental
needs
the
state
could
make
a
direct
payment
to
the
landlord;
this
is
provided
by
federal
regulations
and
states
regulations.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
mean,
this
is
an
assumption,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
in
the
instant
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
instant
case
that
indicates
that
these
so
called
lodgers
are
paying
their
food
and
clothing
from
the
grants
of
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
they
are
sharing
the
space.
despite
the
state's
concern
with
meeting
the
actual
needs
of
each
of
the
recipients
the
grant
is
reduced
automatically,
solely
because
the
caretaker
relative
has
allowed
another
person
to
reside
in
the
home.
i
submit
that
the
state
can
rationally
make
case-by-case
determinations
of
whether
this
lodger
has
in
fact
made
a
contribution,
indeed,
even
--
can
make
case-by-case
determinations
whether
the
family
has
any
excessive
space.
and
making
these
case-by-case
determinations
would
not
impose
a
great
burden
on
the
state
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
state
already
makes
its
fair
hearing
procedure
available
in
all
cases
are
proposed
reductions
in
the
public
assistance
grant.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
is
the
example
that
they
did
have
excess
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
--
that
they
were
over
crowded.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
would
concede
that
if
the
state
determined
that
the
family
was
residing
in
over
crowded
quarters,
that
perhaps
the
state
could
take
steps
to
compel
the
lodger
to
leave.
i
say
that
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
yes,
i
agree.
i
think
in
this
--
the
interest
of
the
children
are
paramount
throughout
the
entire
afdc
program,
and
any
rights
that
the
caretaker
relative
might
have
in
relationship
to
association
with
the
lodger
would
have
to
give
way
to
the
welfare
of
the
children.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
would
concede
that
in
that
instance,
any
rights
of
privacy
in
association
that
the
caretaker
relative
has
would
give
way
to
the
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
think
in
that
instance
that
the
state
could
insist
that
the
lodger
leave
the
home.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
it
may
ultimately
result
in
a
neglect
proceeding,
having
to
be
brought
against
the
parent.
i
mean
this
remedy
is
available
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
don't
think
cutting
the
aid
off
would
solve
the
problem.
if
the
family
is
living
in
overly
crowded
quarters
in
accordance
with
the
example
given
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it's
not
going
to
solve
the
problem
to
provide
the
family
with
the
reduced
public
assistance
allowance.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
only
going
to
cause
further
harm
to
the
family.
it's
not
a
means
of
tackling
the
problem.
our
claim
under
the
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well
as
i
say,
there
are
steps
prior
to
that
drastic
steps
that
possibility
of
case
work
services
is
there.
there
are
immediate
--
intermediate
steps
that
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
in
a
case
where
the
children
are
being
curbed,
only
in
that
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
i
would
say
in
the
case
where
the
parent
is
doing
something
that's
causing
harm
to
the
children,
that
a
neglect
proceeding
may
well
have
to
be
the
ultimate
remedy.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
the
state
would
have
no
standing
under
new
york
state
law
to
bring
an
eviction
proceeding.
only
the
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well
as
i
say,
if
they
fail,
the
department
of
social
services
may
well
have
to
bring
in
neglect
proceeding.
it
would
be
brought
new
york
family
court
and
of
course,
the
new
york
family
court
has
wide
discretionary
powers
as
to
the
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
it
would
be
brought
against
the
parent,
against
the
caretaker
relative.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
the
department
of
social
services
in
new
york
routinely
unfortunately
in
a
social
sense,
it
has
to
bring
neglect
proceedings
in
new
york
family
court.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
under
state
law,
there
is
a
statutory
right
of
assigned
counsel.
i
believe,
it
is
section
18
(b)
of
the
judiciary
law.
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
no.
the
lodger
would
not
be
a
party
--
i'm
sorry.
if
the
right
was
--
if
the
question
was
whether
the
lodger
had
a
right
to
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
the
lodger
would
not
be
a
party
to
the
neglect
proceeding
--
mr.
martin
a.
schwartz
well,
i
don't
believe
that
the
lodger
would
be
a
proper
party
in
the
neglect
proceeding.
i
don't
think
he
has
any
interest
in
the
issues
relating
to
the
welfare
of
the
child,
which
are
the
proper
subject
of
a
determination
between
the
state
and
the
caretaker
relative
as
determined
by
the
family
court.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
lodger
would
be
a
party
to
that
proceeding.
i
misunderstood
your
prior
question.
the
new
york
law
is
under
section
18
(b)
of
the
judiciary
law,
and
as
established
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision
in
matter
of
ella
b
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
assign
counsel
that
the
mother
has
in
the
neglect
proceeding,
not
the
care
--
not
the
lodger.
finally,
our
equal
protection
claim
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
with
the
lodger
regulations
do
is
to
create
two
classes
of
equally
needy
families.
one
class
consists
of
the
families
in
which
the
all
persons
in
the
home
are
recipients
of
public
assistance.
the
second
class
of
families
consists
of
families
in
which
the
caretaker
relative
has
invited
a
non-legally
responsible
person
to
reside
in
the
home,
and
solely
because
the
caretaker
relative
has
invited
the
so
called
lodger
into
the
home
the
second
class
of
families
receives
a
reduced
shelter
allowance
and
receives
a
shelter
allowance
which
is
insufficient
to
meet
the
actual
shelter
needs
and
rental
obligation
of
the
family.
now,
we
contend
that
the
caretaker
relatives'
decision
or
choice
to
invite
the
lodger
into
the
home
is
constitutionally
protected
by
the
related
rights
of
privacy
and
association
in
the
home.
these
rights
have
been
recognized
by
such
decisions
of
this
court
as
griswold
versus
connecticut
and
eisenstadt
versus
bad,
which
create
a
zone
of
privacy
in
the
home.
the
lodger
regulations
penalized
the
family
that
--
the
family
and
the
caretaker
relative
for
exercising
this
right
by
reducing
the
allowance
solely
because
the
caretaker
relative
has
invited
another
person
to
reside
in
the
home.
we
submit
that
the
state
does
not
have
a
compelling
interest
to
justify
the
infringements
of
the
rights
of
privacy
and
association.
it
could
reasonably
accomplished
its
interest
by
making
case-by-case
determinations
of
whether
the
lodger
has
in
fact
made
a
contribution,
whether
the
family
in
fact
has
excess
space.
thank
you
very
much.
