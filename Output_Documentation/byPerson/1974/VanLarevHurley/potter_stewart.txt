or
other?
justice

afdc
and
home

stewart
and
is
the
--
there's
federal
participation
in
home
relief,
is
there?
justice
potter

justice
potter
stewart
no.
it

that
the
taylor

the
other
and
what
about
mother
and

had
to
--

stuck
with
the
entire

although
they
were
getting
--
although
the
total

was
getting
one-third
less
shelter

isn't
it?
justice

the
theory
behind
this

it
just
is
that

--
his
share
of
the
shelter
is
attributable
to
him.
