ms.
judith
a.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
central
question
presented
on
this
appeal
and
writ
or
certiorari
is
whether
new
york
is
compelled
to
subsidized
the
shelter
cost
of
an
individual
who
is
neither
an
applicant,
nor
a
recipient
to
public
assistance
because
he
shares
a
dwelling
with
recipients
of
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
with
recipients
of
home
relief,
new
york
state
and
locally
financed
program.
we
will
not
consider
today
the
proceedings
below,
except
in
passings,
since
they
are
set
forth
in
detail
in
our
main
brief,
and
it
is
not
contended
by
either
the
appellants
or
the
appellees
that
there
were
any
procedural
bars
to
this
court's
consideration
of
dependent
social
security
act
claims
raised
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
wherein
the
appellants
seek
of
judgment
of
affirmance,
and/or
to
this
court's
consideration
of
the
constitutional
claims
raised
on
the
direct
appeal
from
the
three-judge
district
court
in
which
the
appellants
seek
a
reversal.
nor
will
we
consider,
except
in
passing,
the
subsidiary
issues
briefed
in
appellants'
main
brief
at
points
4,
5
and
6
and
in
appellee's
brief
on
the
merits
at
4,
5
and
6.
in
new
york,
shelter
is
a
separate
component
of
assistance
that
every
individual
receives.
the
other
component
that
the
recipient
receives
is
a
per-person
flat
grant
for
food,
clothing
and
incidentals.
the
amount
paid
for
shelter
or
the
shelter
allowance
is
variable
and
depends
on
two
factors:
the
actual
rent
on
the
dwelling
in
which
the
recipients
live
up
to
maximum
established
by
number
of
rooms
or
number
of
recipients
who
in
fact
live
there,
and
two;
it
is
based
on
the
percentage
of
recipients
in
relation
to
the
total
number
of
individuals
who
live
in
a
particular
dwelling.
the
result
of
the
computation
of
shelter
allowances
in
light
of
these
factors
results
in
the
finding
that
in
new
york,
every
recipient
receives
100%
of
his
per
capita
standard
of
need,
or
his
individual
shelter
need
determined
in
light
of
his
actual
participation
or
his
share
of
the
dwelling
in
which
he
lives
and
in
relation
to
the
actual
or
maximum
allowed
rent
on
that
dwelling.
under
the
system,
no
new
york
recipient
can
receive
the
entire
cost
of
a
dwelling
unless
he
is
in
fact
the
exclusive
occupant
of
that
dwelling.
since
to
do
so,
would
be
to
attribute
or
transfer
the
needs
of
the
other
individuals
who
live
there
to
the
recipient.
equally,
no
new
york
recipient
receives
a
fixed
or
averaged
allowance
based
on
the
shelter
needs
of
a
hypothetical
recipient,
such
as
are
provided
under
flat
grant
systems.
to
assure
the
court
that
in
stating
that
new
york
needs
100%
of
the
per
capita
standard
of
need
of
its
recipients
in
terms
of
their
shelter,
and
to
assure
you
that
we
are
not
asking
the
realities
by
omitting
consideration
of
the
substance
of
the
standard
of
need,
we
note
that
the
maximums
involved
--
the
maximums
under
which
the
--
the
maximum
which
provide
the
sealing
under
which
the
shelter
allowances
are
computed
are
provided
by
the
58
local
services,
social
services
districts
which
comprise
the
state.
that
is
intended
by
the
state
department
of
social
services
as
expressed
directly
in
its
pertinent
regulation
that
the
maximums
be
set
at
levels
which
provide
shelter
for
recipients
in
conformity
with
local
standards,
and
that
the
maximums
are
updated
from
time
to
time
as
appears
on
the
face
of
them,
in
the
appendix
at
pages
523
to
603.
and
that
the
maximums
themselves
are
subject
to
exceptions
in
favor
of
the
recipients
which
are
commonly
made
by
local
authorities
to
assure
that
shelter
is
in
fact
provided
to
the
recipients.
the
point
is
demonstrated
most
clearly
by
the
uncontested
statement
in
the
record
below
that
approximately
93%
of
new
york
recipients
received
shelter
allowances
equal
to
their
full
cost.
thus,
the
standard
of
shelter
need
is
actual
cost
for
the
vast
majority
of
new
york
recipients.
ms.

this
is
both,
for
both
the
afdc
program
and
the
home
relief
program.
those
being
the
only
two
remaining
programs
that
are
subject
to
direct
state
supervision
since
the
federal
ssi
takeover,
and
the
93%
refers
to
both
categories.

is
no

that
is
wholly
state
and
locally
financed.
the
question
of
whether
new
york
must
subsidize
shelter
cost
of
the
non-recipient
who
shares
a
dwelling
with
the
recipient
of
afdc
or
home
relief
is
presented
in
the
specific
context
of
appellee's
challenge
to
section
352.30
(d)
of
the
social
services
title
of
the
new
york
code
of
rules
and
regulations,
and
is
limited
to
the
portion
of
the
regulation
which
prorates
the
actual
of
maximum
allowed
rent
for
a
dwelling
share
between
recipients
and
non-recipients
when
that
recipient
pays
less
than
$15.00
a
month.
this
non-recipient
is
called
a
non-contributing
or
nonpaying
lodger
under
the
terms
of
the
regulation.
the
result
of
the
proration
under
this
portion
of
the
regulation
is
the
determination
of
the
per
capita
cost
for
each
individual
who
lives
in
the
dwelling,
and
the
payment
of
shelter
allowances
equal
to
the
per
capita
shares
or
needs
of
the
recipients.
while
no
public
subsidy
is
provided
in
the
form
of
a
shelter
allowance
or
by
other
means
for
the
needs
of
the
nonpaying
non-recipient
lodger.
sections
352.30
(d)
contains
an
additional
provision
for
contributing
lodgers,
who
are
defined
again
as
non-recipients
who
share
dwellings
with
recipients,
but
as
individuals
who
pay
$15.00
or
more
or
$60.00
or
more
per
month,
depending
on
whether
they
are
simply
lodgers
or
boarding
lodgers.
the
contributing
lodger's
payment
is
income
to
the
recipient
and
results
in
a
pro
tanto
reduction
of
the
total
assistance
benefits
paid
to
the
recipient,
with
the
exception
that
the
recipient
is
permitted
to
retain
the
first
$15.00
or
$60.00
pay
as
an
income
exemption
or
disregard.
notwithstanding,
the
permanent
injunction
contained
in
the
judgment
in
order
of
the
district
court
against
this
contributing
lodger
portion
of
the
regulation,
the
appellees
did
not
place
this
provision
in
issue
below
and
concede
it
to
be
valid
in
their
brief
before
this
court,
at
pages
94
to
95.
as
stated,
the
lodgers
in
both
categories
where
the
nonpaying
or
contributing
are
non-recipients.
in
addition,
under
the
terms
of
the
regulation,
these
non-recipients
are
individuals
who
do
not
owe
the
recipients
with
whom
they
live
any
duty
of
support,
and
concomitantly,
the
recipients
and
thus
the
state
who
is
supporting
the
recipient
owes
the
lodger
no
duty
of
support.
however,
the
lodger,
like
all
other
individuals,
bears
the
primary
responsibility
for
his
own
support,
and
this
responsibility
attaches
to
him
regardless
of
whether
he
lives
in
a
separate
dwelling
or
whether
he
just
shares
a
dwelling
with
recipients.
it
continues
until
such
time
as
the
lodger
receives
assistance,
when
that
primary
obligation
is
assumed
by
the
state.
in
this
sense,
the
lodger
is
in
fact
and
is
viewed
under
the
terms
of
the
regulations,
as
having
the
same
obligation
of
self-support
as
all
individuals
in
society
who
are
not
on
assistance.
it
is
this
primary
responsibility
or
legal
obligation
of
the
lodger
that
is
recognized
by
the
regulation
and
no
other.
in
light
of
the
holding
of
the
district
court
--
of
the
three-judge
district
court
majority,
to
the
effect
that
the
nonpaying
lodger
provision
presumes
diminished
shelter
need
when
that
might
not
in
fact
be
the
case,
and
appellees'
repeated
assertions
that
the
regulation
necessarily
results
in
reduced
shelter
allowances,
is
appropriate
to
review
briefly
the
two
factual
situations
in
which
the
nonpaying
lodger
provision
operates,
which
show
in
effect
that
both
these
contentions
are
incorrect.
first,
when
an
individual
is
added
to
a
dwelling
after
recipient
shelter
needs
were
originally
budgeted,
under
these
circumstances,
the
preexisting
per
capita
costs
of
the
recipient
shares
must
be
reevaluated
to
reflect
the
fact
that
the
shelter
needs
of
an
additional
individual
are
being
met,
and
that
the
actual
or
allowed
rent
is
now
allocable
among
the
increased
number
of
individuals.
two
results
follow:
a
reduction
in
per
capita
shelter
need
and
cost
of
the
recipients,
and
a
consequent
reduction
in
shelter
allowances.
now,
this
result
occurs
regardless
or
whether
the
individual
who
is
added
to
the
dwelling
is
a
non-recipient
herein
a
lodger,
or
whether
he
is
indeed
a
recipient
individual.
as
illustrated
by
the
example
--
by
taking
the
example
of
the
situation
where
we
have
for
example
a
group,
both
afdc
recipients
living
in
a
dwelling,
a
point
in
time
comes
when
a
home
relief
recipient
is
added
to
that
dwelling
unit.
the
result
under
the
new
york
program
is
to
reduce
the
per
capita
shelter
cost
of
the
afdc
recipient,
and
to
pay
the
proportionate
share
now
held
by
the
home
relief
recipient
from
the
home
relief
program.
now,
under
the
specific
terms
of
the
regulation
in
issue,
when
the
individual
that
is
added
to
the
dwelling
is
a
non-recipient
and
nonpaying,
we
recognize
these
facts
in
the
regulation
by
not
providing
a
subsidy
for
the
non-recipient,
and
by
recognizing
as
well
that
since
that
recipient
is
nonpaying,
per
force,
a
share
of
that
shelter
cost
will
remain
unpaid.
the
fact
that
the
shelter
cost,
a
share
will
remain
unpaid
does
not
mean
that
the
preexisting
shares
were
not
in
fact
reduced
when
the
lodger
moved
into
the
dwelling,
since
the
lodger
is
in
fact
meeting
his
own
needs
by
his
additional
beneficial
use
of
the
premises,
nor
does
it
mean
that
the
lodger's,
the
recipient's
shares
can
be
increased
if
the
lodger
doesn't
pay
by
transference
of
these
--
the
lodger's
shelter
needs
to
the
recipient
group.
the
second
situation
in
which
the
nonpaying
lodger
provision
operates,
but
does
not
reduce
allowances
is
shown
by
the
facts
since
support
of
the
appellee
taylor's
claim.
when
afdc
recipient
share
dwelling
with
home
relief
recipients
and
one
or
the
other
recipient
group
looses
its
eligibility,
and
thus
maybe
become
a
nonpaying
lodger
under
the
terms
of
the
regulation,
the
per
capita
cost
of
that
individual
is
again
not
compensated.
however,
since
the
number
of
individuals
in
the
dwelling
remained
the
same,
the
valuation
of
the
preexisting
shares
also
remains
the
same,
and
there
is
no
reduction
in
the
recipient's
--
in
the
shelter
allowances
payable
to
the
remaining
recipients.
thus,
when
appellee
taylor
and
her
minor
child
received
afdc
and
appellee's
sister
received
home
relief,
the
maximum
allowed
rent
for
the
apartment
was
prorated
two-thirds
to
afdc
and
one-third
to
hr
for
appellee's
sister.
when
appellee's
sister
lost
her
home
relief
eligibility
and
became
a
nonpaying
lodger,
appellee
and
her
minor
child
continued
to
receive
exactly
the
same
shelter
allowance,
two-thirds
from
the
afdc
program
and
without
any
reduction
obviously.
the
nonpaying/non-recipient,
appellee's
sister,
the
valuation
of
the
share
of
the
nonpaying/non-recipient
remained
again,
the
same.
the
only
difference
between
the
home
relief
and
post
home
relief
situation
is
that
that
share
to
with
virginia
taylor
share
was
not
being
paid.
the
fact
that
the
share
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that's
exactly
the
point
i
was
coming
to
your
honor.
the
fact
that
the
lodger
share
remains
unpaid
does
not,
i
believe
and
i
think
we
can
illustrate,
result
in
eligible
or
drastic
consequences
for
the
remaining
recipient.
rather
it
places
the
recipient
and
the
lodger
herein
plaintiff
--
appellee
taylor
and
the
sister
in
a
situation
where
they
may
choose
among
several
alternatives.
first,
the
lodger
may
pay
his
share
of
shelter
cost
or
possibly
somewhat
less
and
obtain
the
benefits
of
the
contributing
lodger
side
of
the
regulation
which
we
cited.
second,
if
the
lodger
is
truly
needy,
as
it
was
claimed
virginia
taylor
would,
she
or
he
may
apply
for
assistance
which
is
made
available
in
new
york
to
everyone
and
at
100%
of
the
standard
of
need.
now,
in
terms
of
applying
for
assistance,
the
individual
obtains
a
grant
or
allowance
measured
to
meet
his
own
need,
which
of
course
include
the
shelter
cost
and
the
per-person
flat
grant.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
the
fact
--
if
i
understand
you
correctly
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you're
asking
me
whether
or
not
the
fact
that
any
individual
can
obtain
assistance
bears
on
the
operation
of
this
regulation?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
don't
think
it
would
bear
on
the
statutory
question
because
the
statutory
question
is
limited
in
this
case
to
the
afdc
program
and
the
consistency
of
this
regulation
with
the
afdc
program.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
material
to
a
determination
of
that
consistency
whether
under
other
programs,
other
individuals
could
get
aid,
and
we
will
come
to
a
discussion
of
the
relationship
of
the
afc
statutes
to
that
point.
now,
in
terms
of
constitutionality,
while
i
believe
that
a
regulation
which
had
a
uniform
rational
and
fair
operation
would
obviously
be
sustained
under
a
due
process
or
equal
protection
argument.
it
might
be
an
argument
under
that
--
under
either
clause
that
since,
there
was
no
avail
--
if
in
fact,
there
were
no
availability
of
the
supplemental
fact
of
assistance
in
new
york
that
the
operation
might
operate
--
the
regulation
might
operate
so
harshly
as
to
be
so
arbitrary
and
capriciousness
as
to
deny
due
process.
however,
that
is
not
in
fact
the
case
since
we
do
apply,
we
do
have
the
supplemental
assistance
program.
now,
returning
to
the
alternatives
available
to
the
recipient
who
lives
with
the
nonpaying
lodger;
as
i
was
noting,
the
individual
--
the
nonpaying
lodger
may
obtain
his
own
share
of
assistance,
and
thus
provide
the
--
himself
with
his
own
means
of
support
and
generally,
increase
the
maximum
allowed
rent
available
to
the
combined
unit.
now,
this
course
of
action
was
in
fact
followed
by
the
former
lodgers
in
the
otay
claim
and
by
virginia
taylor,
who
i
should
not
in
response
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
lost
her
original
eligibility
on
home
relief,
apparently
through
her
own
fault.
the
record
shows
that
the
status
of
the
record
on
it
is
not
extensive,
but
the
record
does
show
an
affidavit
of
morgan
rocklein
from
nassau
county
that
she
failed
to
comply
with
continuing
eligibility
requirements.
she
thereafter,
having
lost
her
home
relief,
but
assistance
reapply
but
aid
to
the
disabled
has
been
since
transfer
to
the
ssi
program.
the
third
alternative
is
that
the
lodger
may
leave
the
dwelling,
and
thus
remove
the
basis
for
the
diminution
of
the
recipient's
allowances,
if
in
fact
his
addition
to
the
dwelling
caused
the
diminution.
fourth,
he
may
stay
in
the
dwelling
and
hope
to
have
the
recipients
meet
his
shelter
needs
from
the
balance
of
the
assistance
funds
provided
from
themselves;
namely,
the
per-person
flat
grants
for
food,
clothing
and
incidentals.
now,
mrs.
delicio,
an
applicant
for
intervention
below
stated
that
this
is
the
course
of
action
that
she
would
choose
in
order
to
hold
her
lodger
in
her
home.
however
obviously,
in
view
of
the
three
other
alternatives
which
we've
just
noted,
this
course
of
action
is
not
the
inevitable
or
even
the
intended
result
of
the
operation
of
the
regulation,
and
it
is
doubtful
that
it
could
be
long
pursued
consistently
with
the
goal
of
the
afdc
program
and
the
state's
responsibilities
under
it;
namely,
the
protection
of
the
children,
or
even
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
lodger
in
fact
paid
nothing.
now,
we
are
compelled
to
note
that
appellee's
position
in
this
action
does
not
alleviate
the
alleged
harshness
of
this
alternative
to
with
the
lodger
staying
in
the
house
and
eating
and
living
of
the
flat
grants
provided
for
the
recipients.
as
noted
on
the
delicio
claim,
the
situation
is
brought
about
under
the
facts
of
these
cases
because
it's
claimed
that
the
lodger
is
destitute.
however,
on
appellee's
view
which
would
eliminate
proration
of
shelter
allowances,
for
any
--
under
all
circumstances
where
the,
as
appellees
would
characterize
it,
where
the
individual
lodger
refuses
to
apply
his
available
resources
to
meet
his
own
needs,
and
thus
because
he
is
the
destitute
lodger
and
the
rich
lodger
as
well.
now,
given
that
appellee
state
that
the
refusal
to
apply
his
available
resources
to
meet
his
own
needs,
or
the
refusal
to
obtain
such
resources
from
the
public
assistance
program,
the
result
of
the
combination
of
those
two
factors
is
that
the
lodger
who
remains
in
the
home
on
appellee's
view
still
must
obtain
the
balance
of
his
support
from
the
flat
grants
provided
for
the
recipient
individuals.
now
as
we've
noted
section
352
functions
essentially
in
two
factual
situations,
both
of
which
look
at
the
lodger
after
the
recipient
shelter
needs
were
first
budgeted,
and
generally
where
the
recipients
were
the
first
to
tenants
in
the
dwelling.
we've
also
noted
that
the
computation
of
a
shelter
allowance
under
the
new
york
program
depends
in
part
on
the
percentage
of
recipients
who
live
in
the
dwelling.
thus,
we
come
to
an
additional
regulation
in
the
same
title
of
the
state
code
of
rules
and
regulations,
section
352.3
(c)
where,
if
the
recipients
move
into
a
dwelling
occupied
by
a
lodger,
they
in
their
turn
again
receive
prorated
shares
of
the
shelter
cost
of
that
dwelling
up
to
an
appropriate
maximum
to
meet
their
own
needs.
thus,
in
factually
similar
circumstances,
we
have
factually
similar
regulations,
both
of
which
are
designed
to
meet
the
individual
needs
of
the
recipient
wherein
the
individual
needs
of
the
recipient
regardless
of
whether
he
lives
with
a
lodger
or
if
a
lodger
lives
with
him.
indeed,
proration
is
itself
illustrated
between
recipients
and
recipients
on
the
taylor
claim
as
we
noted
mr.
justice
stewart
when
we
pointed
out
that
when
virginia
was
on
the
home
relief
program
and
the
appellee
and
her
child
were
on
afdc,
there
was
in
affect
they
proration
as
between
those
two
programs.
now,
in
subsidizing
the
shelter
needs
of
the
recipients
and
withholding
a
subsidy
for
the
shelter
needs
of
the
nonpaying
lodger,
section
352.30
(d)
is
a
direct
expression
of
the
social
security
act
provisions
providing
for
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children,
related
states
statutes
and
with
implementing
legislation
in
new
--
under
the
--
with,
pardon
me
--
and
state
statutes
implementing
the
federal
program,
as
well
as
state
statutes
governing
the
home
relief
program.
we
do
not
even
reach
in
this
case
the
traditional
question
presented
on
the
statutory
side
of
afdc
cases;
namely,
whether
the
challenged
state
regulation
imposes
an
additional
condition
of
eligibility
inconsistent
with
the
federal
statutes.
indeed,
the
condition
of
eligibility
required
here
qualified
recipient
status
is
the
exact
same
condition
imposed
by
the
afdc
program
itself.
now,
the
federal
legislation
setting
forth
the
afdc
program
is
set
forth
in
some
detail
in
our
main
brief
at
point
one.
in
sum,
that
legislation
defines
the
class
of
aided
individuals
for
afdc
in
a
manner
which
excludes
the
nonpaying
lodger.
this
is
so
principally
because
the
lodger
has
not
demonstrated
his
eligibility
for
assistance.
in
short,
he
is
not
paid
because
he
is
not
a
recipient.
appellees
point
that
in
addition
and
interestingly
that
the
lodger
could
obtain
assistance
under
the
afdc
program,
as
he
could
obtain
assistance
under
home
relief,
and
this
in
fact
true.
he
can
obtain
assistance
as
an
essential
person.
indeed,
the
facts
mrs.
delicio
alleges
would
have
made
her
lodger
hn
conceivably
an
essential
person
under
afdc.
they
fail
to
know
however
that
the
major
criterion
for
an
essential
person
is
of
course
that
criterion
which
is
applicable
to
all
afdc
individuals;
namely,
demonstration
of
need.
now,
the
federal
and
state
statutes
and
regulations
recognizes
well,
what
is
obviously
commonsense
and
in
fact
true.
that
people
who
receive
afdc
and
indeed
people
who
receive
home
relief,
may
well
choose
to
live
with
non-recipients
and
then
when
that
set
of
circumstances
occurs,
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
follow
the
mandate
of
the
legislation
to
separate
the
needs
of
the
non-recipients,
or
the
person
who
does
not
come
within
the
aided
classes
under
the
federal
program
from
the
needs
of
the
recipient.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
apologize
--
first
your
honor,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
court's
rule.
second,
i
apologize
to
the
extent
that
i
am
in

although
i
am
not
entirely

ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes,
i
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
as
i
was
noting,
the
federal
legislation
notes
that
which
obvious;
namely,
the
dwellings
maybe
shared
in
common,
and
that
when
if
that
is
in
fact
the
case,
it
is
necessary
to
separate
one
need
from
another
in
order
to
compensate
only
those
needs
of
the
recipient.
now,
this
matter
is
usually
accomplished
in
new
york,
which
as
we
noted
at
the
outset
treats
shelter
as
a
separate
item
of
need,
a
matter
again
with
hew
approval,
and
with
reference
to
this
record
established
by
a
document
called
simplified
methods
of
determining
needs,
published
in
1964,
and
indeed,
these
statutes
and
the
regulations
recognize
and
the
program
material
recognized
that
shelter
allowances
maybe
computed
on
an
individualized
basis
such
as
the
system
in
which
new
york
effectively
has
adopted.
proration
with
the
result
of
withholding
the
non-recipient
share,
is
again
expressly
recognized
by
hew,
in
that
same
1964
document,
and
has
been
recognized
with
expressed
reference
to
this
regulation
by
the
approval
of
the
hew
region
2
commissioner,
extended
to
this
regulation
specifically
in
the
course
of
this
litigation.
indeed,
hew's
policy
has
continued
then
to
date,
and
is
shown
in
the
most
recent
document
we
have
available
to
us;
namely,
guidelines
for
development
of
consolidated
afdc
standards
wherein
hew
provides
some
recommendations
for
states
who
wish
to
shift
to
a
flat
grant,
noting
that
the
affect
of
a
flat
grant
system
is
to
average
away
differences
caused
by
proration
between
recipients
and
non-recipients,
thus,
stating
in
effect
that
for
system
--
for
states
who
do
not
adopt
the
flat
grant
system,
that
proration
of
rental
policy
is
still
of
course
in
effect.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
how
long
is
it?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
oh!
it
was
enacted
specifically
your
honor,
i
believe
in
1970.
we
have
several
appendixes
on
that.
in
--
1970
or
1972,
in
terms
in
the
expressed
terms
that
it
has
--
that
it
presently
has.
in
approximately
1965,
i
believe,
provisions
were
added
to
the
social
services
title
of
the
code
which
reflected
the
separation
and
proration
of
lodger's
needs.
now,
the
means
of
proration
and
the
elements
included
in
that
system
have
varied
from
time
to
time,
and
certainly
of
course,
we're
only
concerned
with
the
last
one,
in
appellee's
brief
at
pages
1
(a)
through
4
(a).
they
cite
some
of
the
historical
provisions
and
additional
provisions
appear
in
the
appendix
under
the
appropriate
headings.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
absolutely
not
your
honor.
new
york
never
had
a
king
--
a
man
in
the
house
rule.
in
fact,
i
was
just
coming
to
the
portion
of
my
argument
where
i
was
about
to
state
that
the
regulation
here
involved
is
not
a
man
in
a
house
rule.
this
is
apparent
first
by
the
terms
in
the
regulation,
and
the
facts
in
support
of
the
otay,
taylor
and
olosi
claims,
which
show
that
the
lodger
category
is
not
confined
to
paramours
but
may
include
sons,
sisters
and
male
and
female
friends
of
various
kinds.
second
and
more
importantly,
unlike
king
and
lewis,
it
does
not
depend,
that
is
this
regulation
does
not
depend,
on
a
fictitious
obligation
of
support
running
from
the
lodger
to
the
caretaker
relative
or
to
the
children,
to
the
extent
either
of
their
entire
needs
as
in
king
or
the
extent
of
the
lodgers'
available
resources
as
in
lewis.
rather,
two
obligations
are
considered
by
the
regulation,
or
perhaps
one
is
a
lack
of
obligation.
the
lack
of
any
legally
imposed
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
caretaker
to
support
the
lodger,
and
indeed,
the
obligation
as
we
previously
noted
of
the
lodger
to
support
himself;
at
least
primarily
and
until
such
time
as
he
comes
to
the
state
for
assistance.
in
light
of
these
facts,
appellees'
repeated
use
of
the
term
“payment
for
the
family
expense”
is
a
complete
misnomer.
the
expense
involved
is
that
of
the
lodger,
and
his
prorate
of
share
is
that
share
which
is
assigned
to
meet
his
own
needs.
now,
turning
briefly
to
the
constitutional
--
principal
constitutional
issue
presented,
we
find
that
the
nonpaying
lodger
provision
does
not
depend
on
any
irrebuttable
presumption
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
claim
must
be
viewed
in
light
of
the
fact
as
we've
noted
that
we
are
concern
here
with
a
system
of
individualized
shelter
needs
which
confronts
the
realities
of
the
real
world
in
terms
of
the
recipient's
needs
in
that
world,
that
the
regulations
involved
expressed
directly
or
at
least
clearly
complement
the
federal
afdc
legislation
involved,
and
indeed,
the
federal
hew
program
material,
and
--
which,
if
they
do
not
mandate,
certainly
allow
the
exclusion
of
the
lodger's
needs.
and
again,
we
are
confronted
with
the
situation
where
the
federal
regulations
and
statutes,
if
they
do
not
mandate
one
particular
system
of
determining
shelter
allowances,
certainly
allowed
this
system
and
possibly
a
system
based
on
average
demands
as
well.
now,
none
of
the
federal
legislation
here,
and
indeed,
the
major
state
statutory
provisions
are
challenged
as
unconstitutional.
in
short,
the
underlying
legislation
which
provides
the
basis
on
which
this
system
operates
is
conceded
by
appellees
to
be
constitutional;
it
doesn't
violate
the
due
process
clause
at
all.
we
then
come
to
their
point
where
they
say
“but
these
regulations
which
either
directly
implement
or
complement
the
system
violate
the
due
process
clause.”
now,
in
terms
of
presumptions,
we
must
add
one
further
fact
and
that
is
this
entire
shelter
allowance
program,
and
indeed,
regulation
352.30
(d)
operates
in
the
context
where
a
hearing
is
in
fact
provided.
and
that
hearing
is
provided
following
at
a
recipient's
request
and
following
the
investigation
of
the
facts
at
every
cert
--
every
case,
in
which
a
proposed
reduction
in
the
allowance
is
about
to
take
place,
and
follows
this
court's
decision
in
goldberg
versus
kelly,
and
indeed,
it
is
a
pre-reduction
hearing.
now,
we've
already
noted
or
perhaps,
i
should
point
up
the
fact
that
under
the
statutory
side
of
the
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no
your
honor,
we
are
not
assuming
any
kind
of
contribution.
we
are
--
the
principal
reason
for
the
regulation
is
the
first,
you
stated;
namely,
the
conservation
of
the
public
assistance
resources
for
those
who
are
truly
needy,
and
the
avoidance
of
diversion
of
those
resources
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
not
needy.
now
interestingly,
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
is
absolutely
correct
your
honor.
and
particularly,
one
must
realize
that
the
lodger
here
is
a
stranger
to
the
system.
the
system
does
not
investigate
him
to
any
extent
of
degree
because
he
has
not
come
before
the
government
and
sought
aid.
there
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
they
are
both
civil
and
criminal
penalties,
available
of
civil
remedies
shall
we
say,
as
well
as
criminal
penalties
available
under
the
present
system.
but
i
would
say
first
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
we
can
recover
--
we
can
--
one
must
understand
first
of
all
that
we're
talking
about
two
different
types
of
grants
and
allowances:
one
the
flat
grant.
let
us
assume
that
she
pays
this
money
out
of
the
flat
grant.
it
is
unquestionably
a
diversion
of
that
flat
grant,
although
because
its
provided
for
her
own
needs,
not
that
of
her
mother,
but
she
is
permitted
to
do
that
to
some
extent
and
degree
because
she
has
a
discretionary
choice
of
allocation.
what
we
watch
most
--
what
we
watch
out
for
most
is
whether
the
interest
of
the
child
remain
protected.
if
in
fact
as
judge
oakes
suggested
in
his
second
circuit's
dissent,
she
can
afford
because
she
has
made
wise
discretionary
allocations
of
the
money
to
leave
a
dollar
on
the
collection
plate
on
sunday
from
that
flat
grant,
we
do
not
do
that.
now,
when
the
interest
of
the
child
become
involved,
we
have
various
forms
of
counseling
that
we
can
give
her,
both
psychological
and
budgetary,
down
to
the
point
in
time
where
we
can
if
we
feel
the
need
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
in
other
words
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
if
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes.
i
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
two
points
should
be
made
clear.
for
example
in
your
$15.00
to
the
mother
down
the
street
example,
the
child
was
not
getting
the
benefit
of
that
money,
and
that
payment
was
harming
the
child.
now,
one
could
say
i
shall
in
that
example,
put
that
amount
of
money
for
specific
purpose;
namely,
rent
on
restricted
payment
so
she
won't
have
the
opportunity
to
give
it
to
her
mother
down
the
street,
if
she
gave
part
of
the
shelter
grants.
well
obviously,
that
won't
work
in
the
lodger
situation.
we
could
do
as
judge
oakes
suggested,
we
could
pay
the
money
to
the
woman
and
sue
the
lodger,
or
sue
both
of
them
at
the
end
of
a
given
month
on
the
theory
that
he
had
obtained
money
haven't
received
where
the
benefit
of
a
grant
intended
for
another.
now,
the
difficulty
with
that
theory
your
honor
is
that,
if
we
assume
that
were
if
it
is
true
that
we
can
recover
the
money
from
the
lodger
is
perfectly
clear
that
we
didn't
have
to
pay
it
to
him
in
the
first
place.
and
if
we
entered
into/or
to
her
in
the
first
place,
we
didn't
have
to
pay
it
for
his
benefit
in
the
first
place
and
if
we
entered
into
a
system
on
the
shelter
side,
where
we
sued
--
where
we
sought
to
recover
the
amount
of
the
lodger
shelter
benefit
from
the
lodger,
we
would
be
involved
in
a
system
where
each
lodger
would
be
sued
at
the
end
of
each
monthly
or
by
monthly
payment.
and
as
i
say
again,
confessing
the
validity
of
the
point
of
not
making
the
benefit
available
in
the
first
instance.

us
your
honor,
to
provide
for
his
own
shelter
need.
now
your
honor,
i'm
afraid
that
there
are
two
inherent
defects
in
that
line
of
reasoning:
first,
it
assumes
that
there
are
something
which
appellees
like
the
characterize,
as
a
full
shelter
allowance
or
a
full
grant.
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
new
york
system
as
a
full
shelter
allowance.
there
is
only
a
shelter
allowance
to
meet
each
individual
need.
now
it
may
be
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that
one.
that
would
be
a
$100.00
in
your
case
your
honor
if
for
example,
there
were
four
recipients
and
they're
prorata
shares
of
the
allowed
rent
were
$25.00
each,
alright?
so,
that
would
be
a
$100.00.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
now,
let's
assume
for
example
that
at
the
time
their
needs
were
budgeted,
there
were
three
recipients
and
a
lodger.
their
original
grant
would
be,
let's
say
on
your
example,
$75.00,
right?
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
alright,
on
my
example
your
honor.
there
are
now
three
--
four
recipients.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
i
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no,
that
is
not
the
answer.
but
i
think
perhaps
if
i
can
clarify
my
response
to
justice
marshall.
first
of
all
in
new
york
your
honor,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
minimum
for
three.
there
is
only
your
proportion,
your
--
either
a
lodger
or
a
non-recipient
individual,
your
proportion
of
the
allowed
rent
which
we
point
out
is
largely
the
actual
rent
which
is
also
a
maximum,
not
a
minimum,
and
a
sealing
on
the
amount
of
payments,
not
with
anyone
individual
or
anyone,
any
group
of
individuals
is
entitled
to.
the
measure
of
anyone's
need
is
his
proportion
of
the
dwelling.
now,
if
you
have
three
recipients
in
a
dwelling
your
honor,
and
the
total
dwelling
costs
$100.00
a
month,
each
recipient
in
effect
gets
a
third.
now,
appellees
say
on
that
point
“but
that's
not
true.”
appellants
are
one
because
they
only
make
one
payment.
now,
it
is
true
that
in
some
circumstances,
we
make
one
payment.
for
example,
an
afdc
caretaker
and
her
minor
children
get
one
payment
because
she
is
the
person
of
majority
and
they
are
all
minors,
anyway,
put
it
so.
therefore,
when
we
say
in
your
example,
the
thirds,
they
each
get
a
third.
now,
that
third
also
reflects
their
beneficial
used
of
the
dwelling,
right,
in
thirds.
now,
if
we
add
somebody
else
your
honor,
then
we
have
fourths
because
we
have
four
people
using
the
dwelling,
but
the
cost
didn't
increase.
in
short,
the
needs
of
the
dwelling
--
the
fourth
individual
were
met
in
the
same
space
mr.
justice
white.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that's
right
your
honor.
you
don't
add
on
room,
but
you
add
on
people.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
yes.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
it
might
hold
either
three
or
four
your
honor.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
you
can
put
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
your
honor,
we
didn't
give
a
100.00.
we
gave
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
that's
right
your
honor,
you
couldn't
--
perhaps
so.
you
could
not
get
that
apartment
for
any
cheaper,
and
while
three
individuals
were
in
it,
each
was
allocable
one-third
of
the
cost.
now,
since
as
in
fact
one
of
appellee's
witnesses
below
testified
in
the
evidentiary
hearing,
people
are
not
mechanical
toys.
the
same
apartment
that
accommodates
three
may
very
well
accommodate
four.
and
when
that
fourth
person
comes
in,
he's
need
for
shelter
is
being
met.
and
the
question
is
then
presented,
“should
we
allocate
to
him
a
share
of
cost?”
if
we
do
not
allocate
to
him
a
share
of
cost
your
honor,
we
are
operating
under
a
totally
different
system
than
the
one
that
new
york
operates
under;
namely,
a
flat
grant.
in
addition,
if
we
say
under
the
present
system
that
the
addition
of
an
individual
does
not
diminish
shelter
need,
then
we
are
making
one
of
at
least
several
irrebuttable
presumptions
which
are
far
more
detrimental
to
the
program,
and
indeed
to
the
individual
recipient's
welfare.
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
absolutely
not
your
honor.
we
do
not
cut
down
the
food
allowance
because
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no,
that's
not
fine
your
honor
because
that
would
be
as
in
the
examples
justice
white
gave,
probably
a
diversion
of
grants
for
the
benefit
of
another,
for
which
various
civil
remedies
could
be
applied
to
the
woman,
for
which
various
criminal
remedies
could
be
applied
to
the
woman,
and
which
indeed,
ultimately,
perhaps
the
ultimate
sanction
is
--
ms.
judith
a.
gordon
no,
it's
not
a
crime
to
give
somebody
a
meal
your
honor.
but
if
you
had
a
continuing
pattern
of
behavior,
wherein
a
caretaker
relative
were
diverting
substantial
amounts
of
the
resources
provided
for
herself
and
her
child
to
another,
obviously,
that's
a
diversion
of
the
grant
and
there
is
a
criminal
penalty
for
that.
however
obviously,
we
do
not
enforce
it
in
single
instances
where
there
is
no
harm
to
the
child
that
is
exactly
what
i
was
trying
to
say.
and
indeed
perhaps
the
most
severe
sanction
in
the
entire
program
is
that
if
the
woman
neglects
the
child
by
diverting
the
resources
on
persistent
basis,
we
ultimately
have
the
power
to
remove
the
child.
but
obviously,
this
does
not
work
in
the
lodger
situation
because
we're
talking
about
a
fixed
shelter
allowance
allocable
in
amount
of
certain
number
of
individuals.
i
have
reserved
some
rebuttal
time
and
i
will
close
now.
thank
you
your
honors.
