does
the
availability
of
that
added
kind
of
relief,
does
that
bear
on
the
statutory
question
or
the
constitutional
question
or
both?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
didn't
ask
whether
it
bears
on
the
operation
the
regulation.
i
ask
you
that
it
bears
on
the
statutory
question
that's
involved
in
this
case
or
on
the
constitutional
question
or
on
both?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
gordon?
are
you
familiar
with
our
rule
4401?
it
says
that
the
court
looks
with
disfavor
on
any
oral
argument
that
is
read
from
a
prepared
text.
i
thought
perhaps
i
noticed,
you
were
reading.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
gordon,
what
if
there
were
a
situation
where
the
mother
and
children
occupied
a
couple
of
bedrooms
and
a
lodger
moved
in
and
the
social
services
people
determined
that
that
was
just
one
too
many
people
in
the
house
to
be
helpful.
would
they
have
the
authority
to
ask
the
person
who
owned
or
rented
the
place
to
make
the
lodger
move
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
they
decided
that
the
family
didn't
have
any
excess
of
space,
just
without
the
lodger
and
that
the
lodger
was
one
too
many?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
they
haven't
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
certainly,
if
your
example
of
the
state
could
proceed
on
a
case-by-case
basis
is
to
mean
anything,
presumably
if
the
care
--
the
state
found
the
facts
in
the
individual
case
that
they
would
have
to
be
--
