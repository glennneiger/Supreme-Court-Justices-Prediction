justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
lodger
is
there
and
you
cut
the
amount
right
and
the
lodger
leaves,
you
give
their
amount
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
the
only
purpose
is
to
get
the
lodger
out
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
other
purpose
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
“if
the
lodger
goes
the
money
goes
back.”
you
get
the
$100.00
for
a
shelter,
and
the
lodger
comes
in
and
you
say
“well,
we're
going
to
cut
it
to
80.”
and
the
recipient
said,
“uh-uh,
i
can't
stand
that,
get
out
lodger.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
go
back
to
the
100.
and
the
only
thing
that
is
accomplished
is
the
lodger
is
been
thrown
out
in
the
cold,
cold
world.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
$100.00
in
my
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
a
$100.00.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mine
is
a
$100.00
with
three
recipients
and
nobody
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
first,
you
answer
mine.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
got
three
recipients?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
say
that
minimum
requirements
for
you
--
for
the
three
of
you
is
a
$100.00
a
month.
the
next
month,
a
lodger
moves
in.
they
don't
say
your
requirements
have
dropped.
they
say,
oh
lodger
is
moved
in.
so
without
more,
it's
dropped
to
80,
and
then
lodger
moves
out
and
leaves
the
three
recipients
there,
it
goes
back
to
a
100?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
trouble
is,
in
the
houses
you
don't
add
on
room.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
fact
that
it
would
hold
four
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
knew
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
put
the
three
in
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
you
gave
a
$100.00,
and
when
all
four
moved
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
gave
a
hundred
because
you
couldn't
get
it
for
any
cheaper
that's
why
you
gave
it
a
hundred.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
also
cut
down
the
food
allowance
when
he
eats?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
if
he
lived
next
door
and
came
and
then
eat
three
meals
a
day,
that's
fine?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
a
crime
to
get
somebody
a
meal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
they
will
have
the
authority
to
ask
her
to
do
that.
i
do
not
think
particularly
in
view
of
the
appellees'
associational
and
privacy
claim
if
they
could
compel
where
to
do
that.
as
i
say,
the
ultimate
sanction
for
the
woman
who
does
not
properly
protect
the
interest
of
her
children,
is
of
course,
the
removal
of
the
children
and
the
termination
of
her
status
as
a
caretaker
relative,
if
she
does
what
you
say.
now,
one
of
the
difficulties
involved
in
what
you
say
in
effect,
one
of
the
benefits
of
the
operation
of
the
regulation
is
in
common
sense,
if
you
have
a
lodger
who
has
money
or
if
you
have
a
lodger
who
applies
for
assistance,
in
other
words,
get
the
means
to
support
himself
or
is
willing
to
apply
those
means,
he
then
in
terms
of
his
payment
can
pay
a
share
of
a
larger
apartment
to
accommodate
the
combined
group,
or
he
can
on
assistance,
he
obtains
by
virtue
of
his
getting
on
assistance,
in
affect
the
right
to
a
larger
apartment
to
accommodate
the
combined
group.
but
if
he
chooses
to
refuse
to
pay
anything,
to
refuse
to
get
assistance,
to
live
in
effect
off
the
grants
of
the
recipient
and
the
children
who
are
the
only
individuals
before
the
agency,
then
the
choice
--
their
choice
results
in
a
situation
you
described,
and
our
alternative
is
ultimately
after
exhausting
our
various
lesser
remedies
to
remove
the
children
or
possibly
prosecute
them
if
they
neglect.
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wherever
he
is,
the
three
members
of
the
family
can't
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
schwartz?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
agree
that
this
person
is
getting
shelter
paid
for
by
the
state,
the
lodger?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
it
true
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
who's
paying
the
rent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
is
paying
the
rent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
while
the
state
is
paying
for
rent
and
he
is
living
there,
so,
he
is
getting
a
bounty
from
the
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
without
the
state,
would
they
be
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
the
family
be
there
without
the
state
wanting
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
wouldn't
be
in
that
premises?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
if
the
state
is
paying
the
bills?
justice
thurgood
marshall
since
i
can't
get
an
answer
to
it,
assuming
that
the
state
is
paying
it,
and
assuming
that
he
is
the
lodger,
he
or
she
is
getting
the
benefit
of
the
state
money,
without
the
state's
permission,
what
can
the
state
do
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
with
you,
i'd
have
to
say
“what
if
anything
can
the
state
do
about
it?”[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
possibility.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
i
assume
the
lodger
didn't
have
any
money.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
might
get
its
money
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
do
that,
aren't
you
going
to
concede
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
get
that
money
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
state
says
that
that
applied
only
to
men.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
king
case
applied
only
to
men
[attempt
to
laughter].
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
kind
of
procedure
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
the
lodger
party
to
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i
--
