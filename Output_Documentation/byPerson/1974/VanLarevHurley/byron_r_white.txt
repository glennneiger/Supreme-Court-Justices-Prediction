justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
have
a
lot
of
company
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
in
this
court
effective
with
government
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
can
you
tell
me
mrs.
gordon
why
the
state
makes
its
reduction?
is
it
because
it
just
doesn't
want
to
support
the
lodger
and
the
lodger
inevitably
is
living
off
the
state
when
he
isn't
qualified
to
do
so,
or
are
you
assuming
some
contribution?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
saying
you're
just
familiar
that
the
state
is
just
entitled
to
withhold
funds
that
are
obviously
being
used
to
support
someone
who
isn't
entitled
to
assistance?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
state
do
if
it
discovers
at
some
welfare
or
some
afdc,
a
mother
is
giving
$15.00
a
month
to
her
mother
who
lives
down
the
street?
just
as
in
spending
it
on
the
support
of
her
own
--
of
her
own
children
or
of
herself,
but
is
giving
$15.00
a
month
to
her
mother
who
lives
in
another
establishment?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
recover
the
money
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
can
the
state
find
--
is
there
some
other
way
that
the
state
can
solve
this
problem
of
diversion
other
than
doing
what
--
just
doing
what
it
does
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
not
only
--
even
if
you
left
the
grant,
the
flat
grant
the
way
it
is
without
reduction,
the
child
is
--
it
doesn't
have
as
much
space
as
if
you
thought
it
was
going
to
have
because
the
lodgers
moved
in
and
then
sharing
the
space.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
if
you
reduce
the
grant,
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
further
--
you
even
make
it
harder
on
the
child.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
is
that
concerning
the
welfare
of
the
child?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
one
possible
answer
is
that
with
the
lodger
in,
the
people
are
still
living
in
they
have
proved
by
the
behavior
that
they
don't
need
as
much
as
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
on
the
other
hand,
in
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
example,
mother
and
children
are
occupying
two
bedrooms
and
the
mother's
sister
moves
in
with
them
and
the
children
move
in
with
the
mother
and
the
sister
occupies
the
other
bedroom.
i
suppose
the
children
aren't
really
enjoying
the
space
they
used
to
enjoy?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
fact
is
that
the
lodger
is
being
--
the
space
he
occupies
is
being
paid
for
by
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
isn't
paying
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
somebody
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
so,
but
that's
space,
it's
necessary,
is
no
longer
being
used
by
the
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
lodger's
using
it,
and
whatever
the
state
computed
is
being
needed
by
the
child
isn't
being
used
anymore?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
so
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
there
was
a
--
assume
the
state
calculated
how
much
a
family
of
four
needed
for
food,
is
a
$100.00
a
month.
now,
you
give
them
a
$100.00
a
month,
then
the
family
moves
in
a
so
called
lodger
or
a
relative
and
he
lives
off
the
$100.00
along
with
the
other
four.
now,
he's
eating
part
of
the
food.
now,
is
there
anything
the
state
can
do
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
can
they
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
facts
are
perfectly
clear,
and
the
recipient
--
and
the
afdc
recipients
says
well
of
course,
they've
fifth
person
who's
living
here
and
the
relative
didn't
mine
and
i
intend
to
keep
him
and
we
can
all
live
on
a
$100.00
a
month,
it's
just
that
we're
not
eating
as
well
as
we
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
by
the
recipient,
he
says
“go
about
your
own
business,
i'll
go
about
mine.”
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
that
--
you
mean
that
the
state
could
say
“well
either
move
the
lodger
out
or
we
are
going
to
cut
you
off
entirely”?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
that
and
know
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
will
take
it
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
i
know,
but
whatever
--
in
my
example,
whatever
food
comes
into
the
house
by
five
people
now
sharing
instead
of
four
and
what
can
the
state
do
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
i
understand
that,
but
they
are
sharing
the
space?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
good
would
they
do
if
you
say
“how
much
difference
would
--
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
give
way
to
what?
will
the
state
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
cut
off
payment
if
you
don't
take
the
aid
off?
