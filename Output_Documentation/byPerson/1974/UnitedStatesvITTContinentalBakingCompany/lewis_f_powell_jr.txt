justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
has
the
federal
trade
commission
imposing
daily
penalties
for
comparable
infringements
as
uses
of
orders
consent
decrees
of
this
kind
over
the
past
years?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
this
case,
it
was
eighth
circuit
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
far
as
you
know,
these
are
the
only
two
cases?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
there
any
regulation
under
commission
or
any
other
means
by
which
authority
might
be
notified
that
the
commission
took
this
interpretation
of
the
statue,
that
is
that
daily
penalties
were
appropriate
when
an
acquisition
was
made?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that
but
it
does
seem
to
me
as
evidence
by
the
fact
that
we
are
here
today
that
it's
arguable
whether
the
statute
means
what
the
commission
says
it
means.
that
being
so,
i
was
wondering
whether
there
had
been
any
sort
of
regulation
or
notice
given
in
any
other
way?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
john
h.
schafer,
did
the
agreements
with
continental
prohibit
these
three
smaller
companies
from
producing
bread
in
the
future?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
were
free
to
do
that,
isn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
schafer
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
schafer,
you
have
mentioned
the
economics
of
the
bread
business.
one
of
these
companies
had
sales
of
$300,000
a
year.
what
would
the
profit
margin
among
the
sales
of
that
magnitude
be
in
the
bread
business?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
schafer
is
there
any
difference
between
you
and
mr.
friedman
as
to
the
maximum
amount
of
the
possible
penalty
on
the
government's
theory?
