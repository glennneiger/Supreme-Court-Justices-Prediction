mr.
john
h.
schafer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
what
this
case
involves
is
an
attempt
by
the
government
to
secure
a
retroactive
rewriting
of
a
consent
decree
which
prevents
only
acquisitions,
so
as
to
permit
the
imposition
of
daily
penalties
in
addition
to
those
that
already
have
been
imposed,
for
something
that's
not
barred
by
that
consent
decree,
that
is
the
retention
of
acquisition
of
access
required.
the
government's
position
flies
directly
in
a
face
in
our
judgment
of
the
armour
decision
of
this
court,
the
hughes
decision,
the
atlantic
refining
decision.
and
our
case
i
believe
is
a
fortiori
to
those
cases
because
contrary
to
those
cases
which
arose
basically
in
terms
of
a
construction
of
those
consent
decrees,
here
we
are
dealing
with
a
penalty
action
in
which
the
government
is
seeking
as
i
say,
retroactively
to
interpret
this
consent
decree
so
as
to
impose
multi-millions
of
dollars
of
penalties
on
itt
continental
baking
company.
so
the
underlying
rationale
of
this
court's
decisions
prevent
that
and
i
think
that
if
that
rationale
is
ever
to
be
applied,
it
should
be
applied
in
this
kind
of
a
case
where
we
are
dealing
not
with
a
prospective
interpretation
of
the
consent
decree,
what
does
it
mean,
what
we
are
dealing
instead
as
i
say
a
penalty
action.
the
government's
position
and
our
position
would
substantially
weaken
the
anti-trust,
another
enforcement
activity
because
as
we
all
know,
much
of
anti-trust
enforcement
is
conducted
by
way
of
consent
decrees
and
consent
judgments
as
true
with
the
stc
and
other
agencies
as
well.
if
regarding
to
now
as
the
government
urges
you
to
do
to
import
into
consent
decrees,
vague
concepts
of
purpose,
purpose
of
the
underlying
statutes,
purpose
of
the
consent
decrees,
you
are
going
to
instead
of
resolving
litigation
through
consent
judgments,
you
are
going
to
foster
litigation.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well
mr.
chief
justice,
what
armour
teaches,
what
atlantic
refining
teaches
and
what
hughes
teaches,
is
that
you
look
at
the
document
and
as
written,
it's
a
contract
composed
between
two
opposing
parties
designed
to
do
nothing
but
to
eliminate
the
litigation.
it
doesn't
have
by
itself
any
purpose
and
if
there
is
a
statutory
purpose,
that's
irrelevant.
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
construction
--
excuse
me.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
if
there
is
ambiguity
mr.
chief
justice
in
a
contract,
that's
true
of
course
under
standard
contract
law,
it
is
permissible
for
the
court
to
look
at
the
background
of
the
negotiations.
the
government
doesn't
claim
any
ambiguity
here.
it
simply
wants
you
because
of
what
it
says
as
the
purposes
of
this
consent
decree
to
add
some
words
to
it.
it
wants
you
to
say
the
consent
decree
doesn't
proscribe
acquiring,
that
it
proscribes
acquiring
and
holding
or
acquiring
and
owning
or
any
other
language
you
want
to
say.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
on
this
decree,
that's
the
fair
reading
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
not
the
sole
price,
because
as
you
pointed
out,
divestiture
is
a
very
real
price.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that
would
be
true,
that
would
be
true.
the
government
can
avoid
that
by
writing
a
different
consent
decree,
but
that's
true.
the
sole
penalty
price
would
be
the
5000,
that's
true,
now
10,000
under
the
new
statute,
but
you
do
have
divestiture.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
unless
they're
trying
to
play
tricks
on
us,
i
would
assume
that
they
would
write
it
that
way,
yes.
as
i
say,
the
government
in
its
brief,
it
didn't
do
it
today
but
in
its
brief
it
argues
that
unless
you
construe
this
decree
our
way
it's
going
to
be
a
toothless,
unenforceable
decree
and
that's
not
so.
not
only
is
the
penalty
involved,
but
that's
really
seems
to
me
tantamount
to
arguing
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
is
toothless
and
unenforceable.
the
only
belief
there
is
divestiture.
no
one
to
my
mind
has
ever
suggested
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
is
unenforceable.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
was
denied,
the
government
did
not
make
assuring
warning
divestiture
in
the
judgment
of
this
court.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
oh,
surely
they
can
charge
these
with
the
section
7
violations,
no
question
about
that,
yes.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
quite
right
and
they
are
arguing
and
been
sustained
in
the
courts
below
that
they
don't
even
have
to
bring
section
7
in
order
to
ask
for
divestiture.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
i
don't
know
if
you
really
would
say
mr.
justice
white
that
they
really
tried
it
out,
they
claim
they
were
denied
but
they
never
made
--
in
the
district
court's
judgment
they
never
made
a
showing
on
divestiture,
they
had
it
in
their
complaint.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
haven't
thought
it
through,
but
i
think
that
you
would
have
different
issues,
i
think
you
would
have
different
issues.
now,
i
should
say
--
let
me
go
if
i
may
to
the
factual
framework
of
these
so
called
acquisitions.
these
are
simply
supply
contracts.
these
are
contracts
by
which
continental
agreed
to
supply
these
former
producers
of
bread
and
rolls
that
continental
would
supply
them
their
requirements
of
bread
and
rolls,
that
those
foreign
producers
would
distribute
those
bread
and
rolls
in
there
trading
areas.
they
were
pure
requirements
contracts
or
distribution
agreements
whatever
you
want
to
call
them.
mr.
friedman
expresses
some
--
they're
called
sales
agreements.
well
they
are
sales
agreements,
they
are
agreements
to
buy
and
sell
bread,
that's
all
they
are.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
comes
out
of
a
stipulation
we
agreed,
the
lawyers
brought
up
stipulation
to
resolve
this
dispute
and
we
agreed
to
stipulate
that
it
was
the
understanding
of
both
sides
that
those
former
producers
would
stop
selling
and
what
that
simply
meant
was
that
we
knew
when
we
took
on
the
obligations
to
supply
them
that
they
were
no
longer
going
to
supply
themselves.
we
did
not
bargain
for
that.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
economics
of
this
industry
are
that
the
small
producer
is
increasingly
non
competitive.
these
three
companies
in
the
missoula,
montana,
in
cheyenne,
wyoming
and
in
durango,
colorado
concluded
independently
and
for
their
own
reasons
as
stated
in
the
appendix
to
cease
the
production
of
bread.
they
did
however
want
to
stay
in
the
bread
business.
so,
they
agreed
with
continental
to
purchase
continental
bread
and
to
sell
it
in
their
trade
areas.
they
remained
independent,
competitive
entities.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
the
missoula
bread
came
out
at
spokane
bakery,
spokane,
washington,
the
bread
for
durango
and
cheyenne
came
out
of
it's
denver
bakery.
these
companies
remained
independent,
the
sole-owned
companies.
they
own
their
own
assets.
they
own
their
own
trucks,
they
hire
their
own
personnel,
they
own
their
own
sales
roots.
their
customer
lists
--
there
are
number,
they
owned
all
their
assets,
they
were
not
acquired
by
continental.
there
is
nothing
here,
but
a
distribution
agreement,
a
requirements
contract,
a
sales
agreemnt,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
it
did
not
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
they
were
free
to
do
that,
yes.
the
fact
is
that
shepherd
baking
company,
after
this
record
closed,
shepherd
baking
company
in
durango,
for
its
own
independent
reasons
concluded
to
switch
suppliers,
so
that
continental
no
longer
supplies
shepherd
in
durango.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yeah,
we
knew
they
were
no
longer
going
to
be
producing,
they
told
us
that.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
was
not
an
understanding
in
a
contract
bargained
for
sense
mr.
justice
white.
it
was
simply
our
understanding
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
these
companies
were
no
longer,
for
their
own
independent
reasons,
going
to
bake
bread.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
they
would
have
never
had
no
interest
whatever
in
buying
continental
bread
if
they
are
going
to
bake
their
own
bread.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
not
at
all,
not
at
all.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
did
agree
to
supply
all
their
requirements.
they
were
free
to
purchase
bread
from
other
--
items
from
other
bakeries,
but
continental
had
the
right
to
approve
that,
and
the
record
shows
that
on
some
occasions,
application
was
made
to
purchase
other
products
from
other
bakeries
and
that
approval
was
granted.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
today
it
would
be
a
substantial
loss.
i
don't
if
the
record
reflects
that,
that's
not
high
volume.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
and
it
would
depend
upon
the
economies
of
scale
that
he
could
achieve
in
his
producing
plan.
now
with
that
kind
of
volume,
he
probably
had
production
costs
running
something
like
75%
of
his
total
wholesale
prices
and
you
are
not
competitive
at
that
level.
you
have
got
to
be
producing
the
bread,
it's
something
like
45-50%
of
the
total
price
that
you
sell
it
for
and
the
rest
of
your,
and
then
your
distribution
costs
account
for
another
40%
or
so
and
then
you
are
looking
at
the
maximum
or
50%
profit.
but
a
small
volume
baker
is
running
very
high
production
costs,
and
for
that
reason,
these
bakers,
as
i
say
independently
concluded
to
withdraw
from
the
production
end
of
the
business,
but
to
engage
as
independent
companies
in
the
sale
of
the
bread.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
i
think
that
the
underlying
issue
of
violation
is
much
â€“
is
clear,
relatively
clear
there
mr.
justice
blackmun.
we
contend
we
did
not
violate
the
order;
i
don't
know,
i
don't
make
that
contention
as
to
beatrice.
i
think
there
was
an
acquisition
there.
we
are
contenting
there
was
not,
but
the
continuing
penalty
question
is
not
distinguishable
in
our
judgment.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it's
a
clear
conflict
mr.
justice
stewart
on
that
issue.
the
beatrice
court
adopted
in
toto
the
arguments
being
urged
upon
this
court
in
this
case
and
that
were
urged
on
the
court
in
the
tenth
circuit
case.
they
adopted
in
toto
the
government's
argument
that
to
enforce
the
purpose
of
this
consent
decree,
you
have
got
to
construe
this
transaction,
this
consent
order
in
the
way
we
want
you
to.
and
as
i
say,
that
in
our
judgment
is
contrary
to
all
of
the
decisions
that
this
court
has
rendered
on
the
matter.
now
we
also
contend
that
the
government,
even
if
you
were
to
look
to
purposes,
even
if
you
contrary
to
armour
and
the
other
cases,
if
you
were
to
agree
with
the
government
that
you
could
look
at
purposes,
it
doesn't
help
the
government
here
at
all,
because
this
was
a
complaint
directed
against
the
act
of
acquisitions.
the
section
7,
the
clayton
act,
under
which
the
complaint
was
filed,
of
course
reads
on
acquisitions.
you
are
concerned
about
concentration
and
what
not,
is
completely
handled
by
a
ban
against
acquisitions.
the
retention
argument
just
doesn't
make
in
our
judgment
any
sense;
you
don't
need
that.
if
i
acquire
my
competitor
or
if
i
acquire
my
competitor's
supplier,
or
my
competitor's
customer,
that
act
of
acquisition
is
what
section
7
reads
on,
and
if
there
is
any
adverse
impact
on
competition,
it's
that
act.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
i
scrap
that
acquisition
and
sell
it
to
the
junk
man,
or
whether
i
retain
it.
if
i
buy
my
competitor,
he
is
out
of
business
who
is
no
longer
in
competition.
so
it's
the
acquisition
that
the
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
true,
that's
true.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
in
the
penalty
action,
you
mean
we
are
not
in
section
7
case.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
yes,
i
think
that's
right,
you
are
still
injuring
because
the
act
that
you
committed
back
in
1917,
if
you
will,
the
act
that
you
committed
at
the
time
of
suit
can
be
said
to
be
causing
an
adverse
impact
on
competition.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
i
suppose
there
is
no
violation.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
as
i
understand
the
theory
which
comes
of
course
out
of
this
court's
decisions
that
divestiture
is
almost
mandatory,
where
a
violation
of
section
7
is
found,
divestiture
is
virtually
mandatory,
because
that's
the
only
hope
you
have
of
reconstituting
the
industry
before
the
illegal
act
occurred.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that's
the
good
word,
yes,
that's
my
understanding
of
the
concept.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
that
may
be,
i
am
having
hard
time
understanding
how
that
could
then
be
a
violation
mr.
justice
white,
if
there
is
no
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
at
the
time
of
suit.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
at
time
of
suit,
there
was
adverse
impact
on
competition.
if
they
were
none,
i
take
that
there'd
be
no
violation
of
section
7.
if
there
were,
the
routine
solution
is
divestiture
to
put
the
industry
back
to
where
it
was
before.
now,
in
our
judgment
the
government
position
here,
as
i
guess
i
have
suggested
violates
the
two
basic
principles
of
consent
decree
construction,
settled
by
armour,
settled
by
hughes
and
other
cases.
one
is
that
the
language
is
to
be
construed
as
it's
written,
it's
like
a
contract.
and
this
language
is
the
government
really
admits
in
its
oral
argument,
and
in
its
briefs,
this
language
has
to
be
changed
in
order
to
support
this
claim
for
daily
penalties.
it
has
to
be
changed
to
read
beyond
acquisition,
it
has
to
incorporate
the
concept
of
holding
and
retention,
and
that
is
not
construing
then
the
consent
decree
as
it
was
written
is
construing
in
a
different
way.
the
second
tenant
of
construction
is
that
this
court's
decisions
instruct
us
that
you
don't
as
i
say
look
to
the
purposes
underlying
the
statute
or
the
purposes
so
called
underlined
the
consent
decrees.
as
i
have
said
that
the
government's
position
simply
doesn't
support
its
claim
that
you
look
to
our
concentration.
you
saw
when
you
concerned
about
concentration
by
banning
the
act
of
acquisition,
that's
what
this
order
did.
there
is
no
basis
in
this
record
certainly
for
a
so
called
concern
on
the
part
of
the
government,
that
if
you
don't
construe
this
consent
order
to
afford
the
basis
for
daily
penalties
that
you
are
going
to
have
flagrant
violations
of
these
consent
decrees.
as
mr.
friedman
admitted,
as
far
as
everybody
knows
there
is
only
been
two
situations
like
this
come
up
in
all
of
the
years
of
clayton
act
enforcement.
section
7
as
i
have
said,
seems
to
me
to
be
self
enforcing
even
though
the
only
remedy
there
is
divestiture,
and
anyway
such
fears
in
enforceability
or
un-enforceability
of
consent
decrees
are
really
irrelevant
to
how
you
construe
a
consent
decree.
as
we
struck
the
bargain
in
1962,
we
labored
over
it.
the
government
wanted
the
20-year
ban,
we
wanted
the
5-year
ban,
we
ended
up
with
a
10-year
ban.
the
government
wanted
to
proscribe
acquisitions
of
any
companies
engaged
either
in
the
production
or
the
sale
of
bread
and
we
didn't
want
that,
because
we
wanted
to
be
free
to
buy,
acquire
companies
without
violating
the
order,
that
were
engaged
only
in
the
sale
of
bread,
because
of
that
time
there
were
many
such
independent
little
companies
strung
around
the
country,
who
were
basically
one
man
shows,
and
who
from
time
to
time
came
to
continental
and
wanted
to
be
acquired
because
they
were
getting
old
or
something.
so
we
bargained
for
that
and
we
changed
the
word
production
or
sale
in
the
order
to
production
and
sale.
so
these
are
very
important
words
that
we
bargained
of.
as
the
district
court
found
this,
there
was
a
reasonable
basis
for
reading
the
order
the
way
we
read
it,
not
to
ban
these
transactions.
there
is
no
basis
here
to
say
that
this
was
a
flagrant
violation
of
this
order.
as
i
have
said
there
had
been
no
record
except
for
the
beatrice
case
of
any
other
situation
like
this
coming
up.
and
moreover
these
so
called
fears
of
the
government
about
flagrant
violations
continuing
can
surely
be
amply
accommodated
by
changing
the
outstanding
orders
they
have
through
proper
procedures
with
proper
hearings,
and
by
writing
new
orders
which
read
on
the
situation
as
they
want
this
one
to
read.
as
i
have
said
that
in
our
judgment,
the
government's
argument
here
is
short
sighted.
consent
negotiations,
consent
decrees,
and
consent
judgments
are
extremely
important
to
the
antitrust
enforcement
program.
they
are
important
to
the
--
i
know
the
sec
and
to
other
government
agencies,
and
if
we
are
going
to
now
import
all
kinds
of
vague
concepts
of
purpose
into
these
consent
decrees,
we
are
not
going
to
--
we
are
going
to
certainly
chew
any
enthusiasm,
anybody
might
have
for
disposing
a
litigation
and
abandoning
the
right
to
trial
by
coming
up
with
a
consent
disposition
of
a
case.
the
government,
turning
if
i
may
briefly
to
the
question
raised
by
the
government
as
to
whether
or
not
we
are
permitted
or
may
should
be
permitted
to
raise
the
other
issues
that
we
have
raised
in
this
case,
for
many
years,
at
least
up
through
the
american
express
decision
this
court
routinely
held
as
consistent
with
appellate
practice,
that
a
party
can
present
any
argument
in
support
of
the
judgment
below.
the
government
now
claims
this
court
has
gone
away
from
that
standard
and
has
adopted
new
standards.
government
now
claims
that
we
may
not
without
cross-petition
for
certiorari,
may
not
raise
an
issue
where
the
logical
impact
of
that
issue
would
be
to
secure
reversal
below
even
though
the
party
isn't
asking
for
it.
we
have
cited
the
court
to
mr.
stern's
article
in
harvard
law
review
on
this
matter
of
practice.
it
says
virtually
everything
there
is
to
say.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
it
says
the
strunk
opinion
and
others
can
be
read
in
a
number
of
ways.
it
says
they
can
be
read,
so
as
not
to
bar
a
party
from
raising
issues
in
support
of
judgments
below
and
mr.
stern
of
course
urges
this
court
to
make
that
clear.
he
does
point
out
the
tremendous
burden
that
would
be
imposed
upon
this
court,
and
upon
the
solicitor
general's
office,
and
upon
parties
if
they
were
required
to
file
what
really
be
useless
anticipatory
petitions
for
certiorari.
in
this
case
isn't
a
good
example.
we
do
not
know
that
government
was
going
to
petition
for
certiorari
until
after
the
period
of
time
expired
in
which
we
could
petition,
because
the
government,
as
is
not
unusual
got
it
an
extension
of
time
at
the
last
minute.
we
got
notice
of
that
in
the
mail
after
the
time
had
run.
so
we
didn't
have
an
extension
they
did,
and
they
filed
a
petition.
now
to
protect
ourselves,
we
would
have
been,
under
the
government's
interpretation
we
would
have
to
file
a
precautionary
petition
for
cert
with
this
court.
i
don't
see
any
real
reason
to
require
that.
there
is
no
policy
judgment
that
i
can
figure
out
that
would
warrant
that
because
in
our
response
to
the
government's
petition
we
listed
in
our
brief
in
opposition,
the
points
that
we
would
raise
or
feel
were
relevant,
in
the
event
the
case
came
up.
the
government
thereby
was
not
prejudiced
when
they
prepared
this
brief
on
the
merits,
it
knows
all
the
issues
that
we
planned
to
present,
it
can
address
itself
to
it.
so
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
to
insist
upon
these
--
really
what,
without
a
strict
rule
of
practice
would
be
unnecessary
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
john
h.
schafer
no,
i
am
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
said
that
it
seems
to
me
the
proper
practice
is
as
we
did
here
to
list
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
cert
petition,
those
issues
which
we
feel
the
court
should
reach
if
it
gets
into
the
case.
now
the
court
at
that
time
could
easily
say
in
its
grant,
we
are
limiting
this
grant
to
these
issues.
the
court
is
informed
in
other
words
and
the
government
is
informed
in
other
words
without
a
labeled
petition
for
certiorari,
the
court
and
the
government
are
informed
that
the
issues
sought
to
be
presented
and
the
court
can
at
that
time
or
later
on
control
its
own
jurisdiction
by
concluding
that
the
issues
that
one
seeks
to
present
are
not
cert
worthy
issues
on
their
own.
i
think
these
issues
are
clearly
cert
worthy
that
we
are
trying
to
present.
the
underlying
issue
of
whether
there
was
a
violation
here
or
distributorship
arrangements,
requirements
contracts
normally
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
well,
they
are
important
--
the
question
is
mr.
justice
white,
whether
or
not
a
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
oh
yes!
we
were
content
to
leave
the
case
where
it
was,
it
didn't
warrant
to
coming
up
here
for
that
penalty,
that's
true
and
the
order
had
expired,
order
has
long
since
expired.
there
was
no
continuing
dispute
here
that
warranted
our
seeking
this
court's
attention.
as
i
say
that
the
issues
we
are
seeking
to
present
in
our
judgment
are
cert
worthy.
it
is
a
requirements
contract
normally
thought
of
if
at
all
under
section
3
of
the
clayton
act,
is
that
an
acquisition
of
the
sort
that
section
7
of
clayton
act
reads
on.
is
the
commission
permitted
to
reach
a
conclusion
that
a
party
is
incurring
daily
penalties
of
up
to
ten
thousand,
in
this
case
thirty
thousand
dollars
per
day
because
the
statute
has
been
amended,
is
it
permitted
to
do
that
without
putting
the
party,
the
respondent
on
notice
that
it
is
in
jeopardy.
i
think
that
is
a
very
serious
issue.
several
district
courts
have
agreed
with
us
on
that.
i
think
it's
clearly
an
important
issue
for
this
court
to
reach.
if
it
disagrees
with
us
that
daily
penalties
may
be
imposed
here,
if
the
court
doesn't
--
if
the
court
in
other
words
adheres
to
armour
and
adheres
to
hughes
and
atlantic
refining
and
the
others,
of
course
these
issue
are
not
reached.
it's
only
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
us
and
conclude
that
daily
penalties
may
be
asserted,
then
we
feel
that
the
question
has
to
be
reached
that
was
there
a
violation
here,
is
the
commission
permitted
simply
the
stand
lightly
by
and
let
a
respondent
pile
up
penalties.
and
thirdly,
is
itt
continental
baking
company
a
successor
of
continental
where
there
is
in
the
consent
order
no
successors
and
assigns
language.
armour
of
course
flatly
says,
that
where
there
is
no
successors
and
assigns
language
in
a
consent
decree,
the
decree
is
not
binding
on
successors
and
assigns.
i
would
think
that
would
be
dispositive
of
this
--
mr.
john
h.
schafer
in
their
complaint
they
asked
for
thousand
dollars
a
day,
mr.
justice
powell.
the
court,
for
reasons
that
were
not
stated
assigned
to
penalty
of
five
thousand
a
day
for
one
days
violation
for
two
different
transactions,
without
an
amendment
to
the
complaint.
we
did
not
oppose
that.
i
think,
frankly
i
think
the
government
could
have
put
in
a
proforma
complaint
amendment
and
cured
that.
the
statute
now
permits
ten
thousands
dollars
per
day,
it's
been
amended
since.
now,
if
that
amended
provision
is
applicable
to
this
case
and
i
suppose
it
is
retroactive,
you
are
looking
at
a
possible
penalty
claim
of
upwards
of
twenty
millions
of
dollars
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
