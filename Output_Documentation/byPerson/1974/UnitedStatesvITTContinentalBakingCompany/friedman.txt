mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
clayton
and
the
federal
trade
commission
acts
provide
a
civil
penalty
of
up
to
$5,000
for
any
violation
of
an
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
statutes
further
provide
that,
where
the
violation
consists
of
a
continuing
refusal
or
neglect
to
obey
the
order
of
the
commission,
then
each
day
for
which
the
violation
continues
is
a
separate
offense.
the
question
in
this
case,
which
is
here
on
the
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
is
whether
where
a
respondent
under
a
commission
order,
prohibiting
certain
acquisitions
without
the
prior
approval
of
the
commission,
makes
those
acquisitions
in
violation
of
the
order,
each
day
that
the
respondent
continues
to
hold
the
illegally
acquired
property
is
a
separate
offense,
or
whether
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case
in
conflict
with
a
decision
of
the
eight
circuit,
there
is
only
a
single
offense
committed
in
each
of
those
situations,
that
is
the
single
act
of
acquisition
and
what
happened
in
this
case
for
these
acquisitions
only
single
penalties
of
the
maximum
of
$5,000
was
imposed.
in
1960,
the
federal
trade
commission
issued
an
administrative
complaint
against
the
respondent's
predecessor,
the
continental
baking
company,
in
which
it
charged
that
since
1952
continental,
which
was
one
of
the
largest
baking
companies
in
the
country,
had
engaged
in
what
it
described
as
the
continuous
practice
of
acquiring
bakeries
throughout
the
country.
the
complaint
alleged
that
seven
specific
acquisitions
of
bakeries
made
by
continental,
violated
section
vii
of
the
clayton
act,
and
it
also
alleged
that
various
practices
committed
by
continental,
violated,
constituted
unfair
acts
and
practices
in
violation
of
section
5
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
after
some
hearings
were
held
before
an
examiner,
the
case
was
settled
in
1962,
through
the
entry
of
a
consent
order.
they
ordered
the
two
things
basically.
first
it
directed
continental
to
divest
itself
of
a
principle
acquisition
challenged
in
the
complaint,
a
firm
called
armour
bakeries,
which
it
was
believed
was
the
eighth
largest
bakery
in
the
united
states.
and
secondly,
it
imposed
a
prohibition
upon
continental
for
ten
years,
against
making
certain
acquisitions
without
the
authority
previously
given
by
the
commission.
mr.
friedman
i
am
sorry
mr.
chief
justice
this
is
in
the
commission
complaint.
mr.
friedman
i
don't
think
that
there
was
let
me
say,
there
was,
at
the
time
that
they
entered
into
the
consent
order,
there
was
also
an
appendix
that
the
parties
signed
which
they
said
would
provide
a
basis
upon
which
the
commission
could
determine
whether
it
was
in
the
public
interest
to
enter
this
order.
and
in
the
course
of
that's
which
was,
it
was
the
part
of
the
agreement
to
settle
the
case
on
consent,
and
in
that
agreement
with
respect
to
at
least
two
of
these
acquisitions
they
concluded
that
there
was
not
a
violation
of
the
act.
but
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
the
commission
limited
the
divestiture
to
armour
could
be
fairly
viewed
as
any
indication
that
it
concluded
that
the
rest
of
the
acquisitions
were
not
illegal,
this
was
a
consent
order,
and
this
was
a
settlement.
they
agreed
to
give
up
the
major
acquisition
they've
made
in
return
for
which
the
commission
allowed
them
to
keep
some
of
the
others
and
that
they
both
agreed
to
include
this
ten-year
ban
on
further
acquisitions.
now
that
provision
is
set
out
at
pages
88â€“89
of
the
record,
and
what
it
says,
directed
the
respondent
to
cease
and
desist
for
ten
years
without
the
prior
approval
of
the
commission
from
acquiring
directly
or
indirectly,
through
subsidiaries
or
otherwise,
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
stock,
share
capital,
or
assets
of
any
concern,
corporate,
or
non-corporate
engaged
in
any
state
of
the
united
states
in
the
production
of
the
sale
of
bread
and
bread-type
rolls.
now,
as
i've
indicated,
the
agreement
which
the
party
signed
consenting
to
this
order
stated
two
things.
first,
it
stated
that
in
construing
this
order,
any
of
the
parties
could
properly,
the
commission
and
the
parties
could
properly
refer
to
the
complaint
itself.
and
in
two
provisions
of
the
complaint,
that
we
think
are
significant
in
determining
the
purpose
of
this
ban
on
acquisitions
for
ten
years
without
prior
commission
approval.
one
of
the
allegations
was,
that
as
result
of
these
acquisitions
continental
had
eliminated
these
acquired
bakeries
as
independent
competitive
factors.
the
other
thing
that
the
complaint
referred
to,
was
there
was
a
substantial
trend
to
industry
wide
concentration
in
the
baking
business.
these
two
allegations
are
set
forth
at
pages
67-68
of
the
appendix.
now,
in
addition
there
were
certain
things
stated
in
the
appendix
which
was
made
a
part
of
the
agreement
on
the
consent
order,
which
bore
on
what
the
commission
was
thinking
when
it
approved
this
order.
the
reason
for
that
is
the
parties
stipulated,
that
these
were
factors
that
the
commission
could
consider
in
determining
whether
it
would
be
the
public
interest
to
adopt
this
consent
order.
and
at
pages
--
page
84,
which
is
the
end
of
the
appendix,
i
would
like
to
read
just
two
sentences
at
the
--
just
before
the
first
full
paragraph.
the
parties
said
that,
if
this
order
is
adopted
by
the
commission,
the
respondent's
alleged
continuous
practice
of
acquiring
companies
baking
and
selling
bread
and
bread-type
rolls
will
be
brought
to
a
halt
and
the
major
acquisition
forming
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
will
be
undone.
competition
may
be
restored
essentially
as
it
existed
before
the
accusation
of
armour
inc.
and
the
public
interest
will
be
well
served.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
rather
clearly,
what
the
parties
intended
this
order
to
do
is
two
things.
one,
to
bring
to
a
halt
the
alleged
practice
of
continental
of
increasing
concentration
by
acquiring
one
bakery
after
another
and
secondly,
to
undo
one
of
the
principal
adverse
effects
on
competition
resulting
from
these
acquisitions
by
requiring
divestiture
of
the
major
accusation,
the
armour
bakeries.
this
order
was
approved
by
the
commission
in
may,
of
1962,
and
in
1966
the
commission
undertook
an
investigation
to
determine
whether
certain
conduct
by
continental
violated
the
order.
specifically,
it
looked
into
three
transactions
which
formed
the
violations
involved
in
this
case.
the
transactions
are
substantially
similar.
in
each
case,
there
was
an
independent
bakery
which
previously
had
both
produced
bread
and
roll,
and
distributed
it
and
in
each
case
the
independent
bakery
agreed
in
effect
with
continental,
that
it
would
give
up
its
production
of
the
bakery
products,
and
would
instead
distribute
to
its
previous
existing
customers,
the
products
that
were
made
by
continental.
in
other
words
continental
in
effect,
took
over,
took
over
the
routes
and
provided
the
bread
for
these
customers
that
had
previously
been
the
property
of
the
independent
customers.
the
stipulated
facts
in
this
case,
on
the
basis
of
which
the
district
court
decided
it,
are
that
the
independent
bakery
distributed
these
products
of
continental
exclusively
under
continental's
name
over
the
routes
and
to
the
same
customers
that
it
had
hitherto
distributed
its
own
product.
and
since
--
there's
a
question
here
as
to
what,
whether
this
was
an
acquisition
of
assets,
i
think
it's
not
insignificant
that
each
of
the
written
agreements
under
which
continental
took
this
over,
are
captioned
sales
agreement.
after
investigation
of
these,
nine
of
these
transactions,
in
1968
the
federal
trade
commission
certified
the
case
in
accordance
with
the
statute
to
the
attorney
general
asking
that
penalties
be
sort
for
these
three
violations
of
the
order.
in
the
interim,
and
the
complaint
was
filed
in
december
1968,
in
the
interim
in
september
1968,
continental
baking
was
acquired
by
the
present
respondent
itt
continental,
a
wholly
on
subsidy
area
of
international
telephone
and
telegraph.
the
government's
theory
upon
which
it
sought
these
penalties,
was
that
these
transactions
violated
the
ban
and
the
order
against
acquiring
directly
or
indirectly
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
assets
of
a
bakery
firm.
the
district
court
held
that
two
of
the
violations
violated
the
order
but
that
the
third
one
didn't.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
findings
of
two
violations
but
disagreed
with
the
court
of
--
with
the
district
court
as
to
the
third
and
held
that
all
three
of
them
violated
the
order.
i
think
the
rationale
of
these
holdings
is
well
set
forth
in
the
district
court's
finding
that
it
said,
this
is
at
page
14
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition.
it
said
particularly
in
businesses
where
route
salesman
are
involved,
customer
lists
have
a
peculiar
value
and
that
they
frequently
represent
the
principal
asset
of
a
business.
and
it
said
that
in
connection
with
these
transactions,
the
most
important
assets
that
continental
acquired
were
the
sales
routes
and
sales
volume
and
in
reversing
the
one
transaction
that
the
district
court
had
held
did
not
violate
the
order,
the
court.
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
market,
that
is
the
customers
and
the
volume,
the
business
of
distributing
the
bread
was
acquired
and
this
was
a
principle
asset
of
the
bakery.
this
determination
reflected
one
of
the
facts
stipulated
in
the
district
court
which
is
at
page
31
of
the
appendix
that
route
books
and
customer
lists
are
asset
of
any
person,
firm
or
corporation
engaged
in
the
distribution
and
sale
of
bakery
products.
the
complaint
in
this
case
sought
penalties
of
$1,000
a
day
for
each
of
these
three
acquisitions,
for
each
day
that
they
held
them
from
the
time
of
the
acquisitions
and
the
transactions
until
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
the
district
court
rejected
this
claim
ruling
that
this
was
not
a
continuing
violation
within
the
meaning
of
the
penalty
provision,
but
was
merely
a
single
violation
and
necessed
a
penalty
for
each
of
the
two
violations,
the
maximum
statutory
penalty
of
$5,000.
what
the
court
said
is
that
the
order
prescribes
only
the
active
acquisition
not
any
retention
and
it
said
once
these
two
acquisitions
were
accomplished,
the
violations
were
completed.
and
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
tenth
circuit
confirmed
that
holding
saying
that
the
--
once
again
the
order
does
not
bar
the
retention
of
assets
illegally
acquired
but
only
the
acquisition
itself.
now
subsequent
to
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
case,
in
a
case
which
is
now
pending
on
certiorari
called
beatrice
foods
v.
united
states,
the
eighth
circuit
reach
the
contrary
conclusion.
it
held
in
a
very
similar
situation
involving
a
dairy
however
and
not
a
bread
company
but
it
was
a
continuing
violation
and
it
accordingly
approved
in
the
beatrice
foods
case,
the
assessment
of
daily
penalties
of
$200
a
day
from
the
date
that
beatrice
foods
took
over
the
supplying
of
milk
to
the
dairy,
to
the
point
that
the
complaint
was
filed,
the
total
violation
that
was
approved
in
the
beatrice
--
i
am
sorry
that
was
approved
in
the
beatrice
foods
case,
was
$156,000
and
in
--
mr.
friedman
well,
if
the
court
gave
us
the
$1,000
a
day
for
which
we
asked
it
would
have
come
to
better
than
$1
million,
but
of
course
we
don't
know
what
penalty
would
have
been
--
the
penalty
would
have
been
if
the
court
had
give
$200
a
day
--
mr.
friedman
we
ask
for
a
1,000
--
mr.
friedman
yes
we
asked,
there
were
three
counts
each
count
--
mr.
friedman
$3,000
a
day
there.
mr.
friedman
$3,000
a
day
for
a
period
from
1965
to
1966
up
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
in
1970.
it
would
be
a
very
substantial
penalty
--
mr.
friedman
well
over
a
million
dollars,
but
we
do
think
mr.
justice,
that
that's
what
congress
intended
in
the
penalty
provision.
mr.
friedman
well,
the
$1,000
is
the
maximum,
that's
all
we
ask,
but
$5,000
is
the
maximum
and
not
infrequently
the
courts
when
they
do
access
penalties
give
less
than
the
government
asks
for.
mr.
friedman
in
this
case,
yes.
that
was
all
we
asked
for.
mr.
friedman
well,
fortunately
mr.
justice,
this
is
a
relatively
infringement
of
commerce,
the
violations.
there
have
been
very
few
cases
in
which
continuing
penalties
were
sought.
i
think
the
reason,
the
reason
is
that
in
most
instances,
these
orders
merely
bar
acquisitions
without
getting
the
approval
of
the
commission.
in
most
instances,
what
happens
is
the
people
come
in
and
seek
the
commission's
approval.
if
the
commission's
turns
them
down,
they
don't
go
ahead
with
the
transaction.
if
the
commission
gives
them
approval,
they
do
go
ahead,
so
it's
been
a
relatively
infrequent
situation.
mr.
friedman
i
don't
know
which
came
first
but
they
were
relatively
simultaneous,
i
don't
know
exactly
when
the
eighth
circuit
case
--
mr.
friedman
as
far
as
i
know,
these
are
the
only
cases
involving
daily
penalties
with
respect
to
these
acquisition
type
orders.
there
maybe
other
cases
involving
daily
penalties.
mr.
friedman
the
commission's
position,
the
commission
does
not
give
ordinarily
give
notice
to
parties
of
this
fact
and
i
think
the
theory
of
it
is
mr.
justice
is
that
the
parties
are
subject
to
the
order.
they
know
they
are
prohibited
from
making
acquisitions
without
getting
the
approval
of
the
commission
and
the
commission
assumes
that
these
parties,
if
they
have
a
transaction
which
is
at
all
dubious,
we
will
come
in.
of
course,
in
this
case,
the
commission
did
make
inquiries
of
these
people
and
there
was
an
extensive
investigation
before
the
penalty
suit
was
sought,
but
the
commission
does
not
follow
the
practice
of
giving
notice.
the
theory
and
i
am
supposing
the
assumption
say
that
the
theory
is
that
the
order
itself
is
notice
to
them
that
they
cannot
acquire
directly
or
indirectly
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
assets
that
the
firm
engaged
in
manufacturing
and
sale
of
bakery
product.
mr.
friedman
no,
there
is
no
regulation.
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
that
this
is
a
factor
that
the
district
court
might
properly
take
into
consideration
in
determining
the
size
of
the
penalty
to
be
assessed.
this
court
has
of
course
discretion
to
decide
how
large
a
penalty
to
be
assessed.
i
just
like
to
refer
to
one
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
the
beatrice
foods
case
when
it
indicated
its
disagreement
with
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
this
case.
it
said
that
the
such
a
limited
construction
of
the
order
is
barring
only
acquisitions
and
not
retention
ignores
the
crucial
effect
of
an
acquisition
and
would
render
non-acquisition
orders
virtually
meaningless.
mr.
friedman
oh
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
the
tenth
circuit
came
first.
but
i
wasn't
--
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell's
question,
i
couldn't
say
which
suit
was
filed
first.
now
there
are
--
mr.
friedman
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice
and
since
this
case,
the
federal
trade
commission
act
has
been
amended
specifically
to
provide
for
equitable
remedies
in
penalty
suits.
but
meaningless
i
think
what
the
court
was
meaningless
in
terms
of
accomplishing
the
purpose
of
the
firm,
in
terms
of
accomplishing
the
purpose
of
these
penalties
to
provide
enough
of
the
penalty
--
mr.
friedman
define
penalty,
yes
and
of
course,
divestiture
isn't
a
penalty,
divestiture
is
merely
from
needs
--
mr.
friedman
it
hurts,
yes
but
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
someone
is
subject
--
mr.
friedman
it
seems
to
me,
it
must
be
mr.
justice,
it
must
be
because
what
you
are
trying
to
do
is
undo
the
violation.
the
violation
was
the
acquisition
and
the
retention
and
the
way
you
want
to
do
it
is
to
divest
the
illegally
acquired
asset.
mr.
friedman
i
would
think
so,
i
would
think
so.
i
think
implicit,
implicit
in
an
order
prohibiting
an
acquisition
is
that
if
you
make
the
acquisition
in
violation
of
the
order,
that
is
a
continuing
violation.
it's
all
part
of
one
thing.
mr.
friedman
well
--
mr.
friedman
well,
there's
a
problem
with
that
mr.
justice
from
now
on
--
mr.
friedman
they
won't
consent,
and
there
are
67
of
them.
there
are
67
of
these
orders
--
mr.
friedman
[attempt
to
laughter]
and
some
of
--
by
the
way,
some
of
these
orders
are
not
consent
orders,
there
are
numbers
we
have
set
up
in
our
appendix,
10
or
12
of
them
that
were
orders
ended
in
trial
and
litigation.
mr.
friedman
yes,
i
think
the
second
circuit
--
mr.
friedman
yes,
the
commission's
position,
the
commission
is
not
included
in
these
orders,
the
words
or
retention.
it
has
limited
these
orders
both
the
consent
orders
and
the
litigated
orders
to
the
word
acquisition
--
mr.
friedman
yes.
mr.
friedman
yes,
that's
the
question,
that's
the
question
in
this
case.
and
the
reason
we
think,
it
is
a
continuing
violation
is
because
of
the
purpose
of
the
order,
that
is
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
acquisition
itself.
the
reason,
the
acquisition
is
prohibited
is
because
of
the
consequences
of
the
acquisition.
the
acquisition
is
the
means
by
which
a
firm
acquires
a
share
of
the
market,
and
makes
a
change
in
the
structure
of
the
market
and
what
is
intended
to
be
prevented
it
seems
to
us
by
both
underlying
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
by
an
order
of
this
type
is
to
prevent
the
kind
of
changes
in
the
structure
of
the
market
that
result
from
acquisitions.
now,
it
just
seems
to
us
that
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
say,
yes,
the
order
prohibits
the
acquisition
and
there's
a
penalty
for
that.
but
once
the
order
is
violated
and
the
acquisition
is
made,
at
that
point,
that's
the
end
of
it,
that's
the
end
of
it.
once
you
have
acquired
it,
in
effect
you
can
continue
to
acquire
it
because
the
defendant
theory
seems
to
be,
it's
not
a
continuing
violation.
mr.
friedman
that
might
be
an
abusive
discretion,
i
don't
know
mr.
justice,
but
certainly,
the
judge
has
considerable
discretion
and
all
we
are
saying,
all
we
are
saying
is
that
the
judge
should
exercise
that
discretion,
should
not
attempt
to
limit,
not
attempt
to
limit
the
penalties
to
the
single
$5000
and
view
just
the
acquisition
as
the
offense.
now,
this
case
we
think
is
a
very
different
case
from
the
armour
decision,
on
which
the
courts
below
relied
and
upon
which
respondent
heavily
relies
in
this
case.
armour,
we
think,
involved
a
different
situation,
a
very
different
situation
than
this
one.
in
armour
the
question
was
whether
the
greyhound
company
would
have
violated
the
meatpackers
consent
decree
by
acquiring
armour.
the
judgment
prohibited
armour
from
acquiring
an
interest
in
a
food
company.
greyhound,
according
the
government's
theory,
was
in
a
food
company,
and
the
government's
theory
was
that
even
though
the
language
of
the
decree
only
prohibited
armour
from
having
an
interest
in
the
food
packing
company,
more
broadly
the
purpose
was
to
effect
a
separation
between
the
meatpackers
and
the
food
companies,
that
the
decree
was
concerned
with
a
relationship
and
this
court
rejected
that
reading.
this
court
said
no,
we
think
what
that
consent
judgment
meant,
what
that
consent
judgment
meant
was
that
it
banned
certain
action
by
armour,
taken
by
armour
and
did
not
ban
action
taken
against
armour
by
greyhound.
and
it's
in
that
context
that
this
court
used
the
words
which
are
relied
on
by
our
components
and
by
lower
courts
that
the
meaning
of
a
consent
decree
must
be
discerned
within
it's
four
corners
and
the
consent
judgment
must
be
interpreted
as
written.
in
armour
of
course,
the
question
basically
was
whether
what
greyhound
was
proposing
to
do,
violated
the
consent
judgment.
in
this
case,
that's
not
the
question.
the
courts
below
held
that
what
continental
baking
had
done,
did
violate
the
consent
order.
the
question
in
this
case,
is
whether,
after
the
violation
took
place,
whether
the
continued
holding
of
the
assets,
whether
the
continued
holding
of
the
assets
constituted
a
continuing
violation.
mr.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
but
i
think
that's
a
different
situation,
i
think.
mr.
friedman
yes,
but
the
restitution
it
seems
to
me,
that's
a
different
thing.
that's
to
make
hold
the
victim
of
the
robbery,
but
here
we
are
dealing
with
an
order,
which
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
designed
merely
to
protect
one
individual
against
the
theft
of
his
property.
here
the
purpose
of
the
order
is
to
deal
with
competition
in
the
bakery
business
and
we
think
that's
a
very
different
situation.
mr.
friedman
it
dealt
with
it
in
terms
of
acquisition,
but
we
think,
inherent
in
the
ban
on
acquisition
is
a
further
ban
upon
retaining
any
assets
acquired
in
violation
of
that
prohibition,
that's
what
we
think
it
is.
i
should
add
two
other
distinctions,
if
i
may,
between
this
case
and
armour.
in
armour
all
that
you
could
go
on,
basically
was
the
consent
judgment.
here
what
we
have,
it
is
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
the
complaint
can
be
referred
to
and
also
this
appendix
which
the
commission
had
before
it
in
dealing,
in
deciding
to
adapt
the
order.
secondly,
all
that
was
involved
in
armour
was
the
interpretation
of
the
judgment.
in
this
case,
we
have
to
interpret
the
consent
order
in
the
light
of
the
statute
specifically
dealing
and
providing
penalties
for
continuing
offenses
and
we
think
that
the
armour
case
does
not
support
the
decision
below.
mr.
friedman
well
i
--
mr.
friedman
well,
it
could
have
been.
that
is
the
commission
could
instead
of
using
the
word
acquisition,
it
could
have
used
the
word
acquisition
and
retention.
it
has
not
done
that
mr.
chief
justice
and
it
hasn't
done
it
i
think
because
it
felt
it
was
unnecessary.
over
the
years,
and
it's
a
large
number
of
these
orders
containing
the
same
thing.
mr.
friedman
no,
i
did
not
say,
i
did
not
--
mr.
friedman
i
think,
perhaps
mr.
justice
white
suggested
that
defendants
might
not
consent,
but
we
think
that
this
is
what
this
order
means.
we
think
the
notion
that
someone
would
say,
i
will
not
consent
to
an
order,
that
tells
me
that
if
despite
the
ban
i
violated
and
retained
the
assets,
i
am
only
--
i
am
not
subject
to
divestiture
or
subject
to
penalties.
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
parties
to
these
orders
didn't
understand,
didn't
understand,
that
what
these
orders
prohibit
is
certain
acquisitions
and
an
awareness
of
the
fact
that
if
they
make
the
acquisitions
and
they
keep
the
acquisitions
they
prohibited
from
making,
they
are
acting
illegally.
mr.
friedman
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
friedman
i
don't
know
how
this
was
drafted
but
i
suspect
as
is
true
in
most
of
these
judgments,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
give
and
take.
but,
i
think
we
gained
--
mr.
friedman
no,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
dispute.
i
think
this
was
kind
of
what
it's
always
been
assumed.
this
is
what
had
been
done.
there
are
67
of
these
outstanding,
all
of
which
say
ban
acquisition
and
there
is
no
reference
to
retention
and
i
think,
it
was
just
the
commission
and
i
am
sure
assumed
that
--
mr.
friedman
that's
right,
we
think
fairly
read
the
word
acquisition
includes
retention.
i
just
want
to
say
one
other
thing
before
reserving
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
the
respondent
makes
three
other
arguments
which
it
says
it
before
the
court.
they
are
offered
allegedly
as
basis
for
affirmance
of
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
two
of
them,
we
have
dealt
with
them
extensively
in
our
reply
brief,
we
don't
think
they
are
properly
before
the
court
because
of
the
respondents'
failure
to
file
a
cross
petition,
two
of
them
don't
relate
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not,
hence
multiple
penalties
are
available
but
only
to
the
period
for
which
the
penalties
would
run,
that
is
whether
the
multiple
penalties
could
continue
after
itt
took
over
continental
baking
or
for
the
period
after
which
the
commission
had
concluded
that
there
was
a
violation.
the
third
contention
is
that
the
actions
of
itt
in
this
case,
the
continental
in
this
case,
this
transaction
didn't
violate
the
order
at
all.
that
issue
was
resolved
against
the
respondent
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
it
now
appears
to
be
saying
as
well
somehow
we
should
be
permitted
to
argue
in
support
of
the
judgment
that
no
penalty
should
have
been
attached,
therefore
you
shouldn't
attach
higher
penalties.
we
think
that
that
is
not
a
permissible
method
of
affirming
the
judgment,
that
contention
does
not
seek
affirmance
of
the
judgment
but
in
effect
seeks
reversal
of
the
judgment.
we
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
it
very
clear
that
respondents
can
argue
points,
the
effect
of
which
would
be
to
support
the
ruling
below,
that
is
you
can
support
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
on
grounds
not
given
by
the
court
of
appeals,
but
you
can't
come
in
and
say
we
support
on
the
grounds
that
it's
wrong.
that
is
not
supporting
it,
that
is
seeking
to
a
return.
mr.
friedman
as
i
recollect
mr.
justice
in
the
audi
case,
it
was
contended
that
the
question
presented
was
broad
enough
to
cover
the
various
points
that
the
government
made,
that
was
my
recollection.
