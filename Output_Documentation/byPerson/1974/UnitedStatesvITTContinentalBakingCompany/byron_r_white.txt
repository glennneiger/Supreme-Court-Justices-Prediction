justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
wouldn't
make
it
meaningless,
wouldn't
make
the
acquisition
order
meaningless
because
i
take
it
that
divestiture
is
an
appropriate
remedy
for
a
violation
of
an
acquisition
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
define
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
hurts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
one
of
the
theory
of
that
divestiture
for
violation
of
an
order;
is
it
because
continuing
it,
and
to
hold
it
violates
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
holding
is
continuous
to
violate
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
if
all
of
it's
taken
and
changing
a
couple
of
words
in
your
consent
decree,
is
then
to
make
it
clear
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
now
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
they
won't
consent.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
since
now
that
they
know
what
your
position
is
they
shouldn't
consent
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
the
issue
here
is
whether
it's
continuing
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
it
is
a
continuing
violation
of
a
statute
is
perfectly
clear
that
each
day
is
a
separate
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
judge
on
the
other
hand
could
accept
to
his
theory
and
still
fairly,
flatly
defended
on
to
this,
i
think
may
give
$5
a
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
fair
reading
the
consent
decree
by
defendant
would
be
that
you
can
make
an
acquisition,
violate
the
order
and
at
the
maximum
it
will
cost
you
$5000.
justice
byron
r.
white
sole
price
for
violating
the
decree.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
the
fine
is
concerned,
it's
$5000
price,
that's
all
for
violation?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
you
would
probably
also
argue
that
if
both
of
you
had
known
this
is
what
the
decree
was
supposed
to
mean,
the
government
would
have
written
it
that
way
in
the
first
place,
they
would
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
can
they
bring
an
independent
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
theoretically
they
can
make
a
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
can't
they
try
that
over
again,
i
guess
they
tried
out
the
--
that
doesn't
your
matter,
it's
important
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
got
a
section
7
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did
stipulate
that
the
understanding
was
that
the
companies
would
not
continue
to
produce?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
the
understanding
--
the
fact
it
may
not
have
been
explicit?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
had
â€“
if
you
would
have
thought
they
were
--
if
you
had
it
--
unless
you
had
thought,
they
were
not
going
to
make
bread,
you
thought
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
don't
sell
it
to
the
junk
man
and
don't
scrap
it,
and
you
continue
to
hold
it
and
operate,
i
suppose
that
you
might
be
entitled
and
maybe
forced
to
divest?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
theory
that
you
are
--
at
the
time
of
the
divestiture,
you
are
still
injuring
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
section
7.
justice
byron
r.
white
divestiture
is
normally
not
ordered
if
at
the
time
of
the
order,
there's
the
--
nobody
is
being
hurt?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
my
question
is
what's
the
theory
on
which
a
divestiture
is
ordered?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
order
divestiture
at
the
time
the
remedy
question
comes
up,
there
is
no
longer
an
injury
to
competition?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
was
at
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
you
decide
it
on
your
own
--
