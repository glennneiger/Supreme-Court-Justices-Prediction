we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
itt
continental
baking
company.
mr.
friedman
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
view
of
the
matter
mr.
friedman
is
that
it's
something
like
a
contempt
order
of
$1000
a
day
and
you
give
the
contemptnor
the
opportunity
to
terminate
it
whenever
he
wants
to.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
everybody
understands
that
in
a
contempt
order,
without
any
ambiguity,
isn't
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
understand
you
correctly,
in
answer
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white,
that
this
consent
decree
could
have
been
made
so
clear
and
unambiguous
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
to
litigate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
except
the
amount?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
you
not
give
some
intimation
or
it
was
that
from
other
some
other
source,
i
got
the
intimation
that
if
it
was
made
that
clear,
you
wouldn't
get
consent
decrees
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
did
not
intimate
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
have
an
issue
here
about
the
construction
of
the
document
according
to
the
authorship?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
consent
decrees
i
ever
had
to
deal
with,
except
for
the
government,
were
drafted
and
all
of
them
had
to
do
with,
both
for
government
and
otherwise
were
drafted
by
the
government
much
like
a
union
contracts
submitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
on
this
part
of
the
decree?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
any
event
your
point
is
there
is
no
ambiguity
to
resolve?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
the
contention.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
schafer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
how
do
you
separate
the
purpose
and
objective
of
the
consent
decree
from
the
underlying
statutes
on
which
it
would
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
when
you
construe
contracts,
even
if
the
lawyer,
the
draftsman
haven't
been
careful
enough
to
put
in
all
the
necessary
desirable
preambles,
it
doesn't
stop
the
court
from
looking
at
the
totality
to
interpret
the
language
of
the
contract,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
continental
agree
to
supply
all
their
requirements?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
schafer.
thank
you
mr.
friedman.
the
case
is
submitted.
