could
the
government
do
that
again
in
this
very
case,
and
now
make
a
better
shot
and
go
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
next
case
73-1290,
united
states
v.
itt
continental
baking
company
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
civil
penalty
provisions
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
federal
trade
commission
act
each
provide
that
each
separate
violation
of
a
federal
trade
commission
cease
and
desist
order
issued
under
the
respective
acts
shall
be
a
separate
offense
except
that
in
the
case
of
a
violation
through
continuing
failure
or
neglect
to
obey
a
final
order
of
the
federal
trade
commission
each
day
of
continuance
of
that
failure
shall
be
deemed
a
separate
offense.
in
this
case,
the
predecessor
of
appellant
itt
continental
baking
company
bought
three
competing
bakeries
in
violation
of
a
federal
trade
commission
consent
order
that
prohibited
and
the
word
used
in
the
consent
order,
the
acquiring
of
other
baking
companies.
and
the
question
is
whether
within
the
meaning
of
that
order,
each
acquiring
was
completed
with
a
purchase
so
as
to
be
subject
only
to
the
single
maximum
penalty
of
$5000
or
whether
each
acquiring
constituted
within
the
meaning
of
the
penalty
statutes,
a
continuing
failure
or
neglect
to
obey
the
order
authorizing
imposition
of
daily
penalties
from
the
time
of
each
purchase
until
the
time
of
disposition
of
the
illegally
purchased
company.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court's
interpretation
of
the
consent
order
as
proscribing
only
the
initial
act
of
purchase
and
held
that
therefore
only
a
single
penalty
might
be
imposed.
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
word
acquiring
as
used
in
the
consent
order
means
both
the
initial
purchase
and
the
maintaining
of
the
rights
acquired
so
that
the
violations
are
continuing
violations
subject
to
daily
penalties.
mr.
justice
stewart
dissents
and
joined
by
the
chief
justice.
mr.
justice
powell
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
