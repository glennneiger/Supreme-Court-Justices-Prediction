justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
mr.
friedman,
supposing
i
commit
the
offense
of
robbery
and
take
$100
from
you.
now,
you
wouldn't
say
that
each
day
i
keep
your
$100
i
am
committing
events
of
robbery,
would
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
the
court
could
require
me
to
make
restitution
just
as
you
in
answer
to
justice
white
said
that
divestiture
can
be
regarded,
even
though
robbery
is
a
one
time
offense?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
dealt
with
it
in
terms
of
acquisitions?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
bakeries
acquired,
agreed
not
to
bake
anything
more
of
their
own,
didn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
a
better
deal
for
them
to
get
it
from
you
then
to
keep
making
the
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
does
continental
make
the
bread
that
it
supplies
to
missoula
and
durango
and
cheyenne?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
a
resumption
of
production
on
their
part
been
actionable
so
far
as
continental
was
concerned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
says
our
strunk
opinion
is
wrong
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
our
control
of
our
own
docket.
now
when
we
grant
a
petition
for
certiorari
we
know
that
the
issue
is
going
to
be
limited
to
one
or
two
issues.
now
we
could
have
a
cross-petition
and
deny
that,
thereby
indicating
we
just
don't
want
to
consider
those
issues.
you
are
suggesting
i
take
it,
that
if
a
cross-petition
is
filed
it
would
be
automatically
granted.
