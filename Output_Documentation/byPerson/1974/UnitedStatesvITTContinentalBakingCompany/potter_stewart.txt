justice
potter
stewart
how
many
dollars
would
have
been
involved
here
if
the
government
--
if
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
watched
your
claim
completely?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
asked
for
a
1,000?
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
you
ask
for
a
1,000
for
each
one
of
these
acquisitions?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
a
$6,000
a
day
for
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
potter
stewart
well
over
a
million
dollar.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
you
point
out,
of
course
to
the
court,
the
$1,000
is
a
maximum.
justice
potter
stewart
thousand
would
have
been
a
maximum
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
whether
the
continued
holding
violated
the
consent
order?
justice
potter
stewart
the
courts
below
held
no,
it
didn't.
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
divestiture
is
the
antonym
of
acquisition,
that's
the
way
you
unring
the
bell
of
acquisition
is
by
divestiture?
