justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
friedman,
do
you
think
that,
that
provision
indicates
that
the
court
felt
the
holding
of
the
other
acquisitions
was
not
improper,
when
it
so
specifically
spelled
out
armour?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
alright.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
would
indicate
that
the
tenth
circuit
case
came
first,
if
it's
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
friedman,
isn't
that
precisely
what
the
government
did
in
the
audi
case
the
last
session?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
i
am
sure
your
opposition
is
contending
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
schafer
do
you
think
the
eighth
circuit's
beatrice
food
case
is
at
all
distinguishable
from
your
case?
