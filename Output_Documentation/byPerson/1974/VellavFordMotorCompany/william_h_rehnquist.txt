justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jaques
do
you
think
that
kind
of
a
question
is
raised
by
our
--
the
question
we
granted
certiorari
on?
well,
we
just
granted
one
of
your
three
questions
that
you
presented
in
your
petition
and
that
was,
whether
a
seaman
was
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure
during
the
interim
between
the
occurrence
of
the
incident
and
the
time
the
disease
was
medically
diagnosed
and
declared
incurable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
man
was
injured
aboard
the
ship
though,
where
he
was
doing
work
wasn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jacques,
as
i
understand
the
jury
awarded
your
client
maintenance
and
cure
for
a
period
of
two
years
from
the
time
he
was
discharged
from
the
vessel
till
a
period
two
years
later?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
maintenance
and
cure
consist
of,
is
it
basically
room
and
board?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
the
assumption
that
he
is
disabled
and
in
the
hospital
during
this
period?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
farrell
has
authority
for
applying
that
on
the
great
lakes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mundell,
supposing
that
at
the
conclusion
of
a
voyage
a
man
has
a
back
complaint
which
he
claims
was
incurred
while
in
the
ship's
service
and
goes
into
a
hospital
and
they
keep
him
there
for
about
three
weeks.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
finally
say,
well
there's
nothing
we
can
do
for
you.
it's
a
partially
slipped
disc
or
some
of
that
but
there's
nothing
more
we
can
do
for
you
here.
shouldn't
he
be
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure
at
least
during
the
time
it
takes
to
--that
he
submitted
that
diagnostic
procedure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
has
no
claim
to
money
for
that
period
of
time
over
and
above
the
hospital
facility.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
a
man
named
dr.
burke
examine
him
some
time
in
1970?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
is
not
unprecedented,
either
precedence
in
this
court
for
where
that
you
have
not
appealed
from
an
award
of
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
grant
limited
certiorari
for
us
to
do
what
you
want
us
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say,
it's
not
unprecedented,
are
you
relying
on
a
particular
case?
