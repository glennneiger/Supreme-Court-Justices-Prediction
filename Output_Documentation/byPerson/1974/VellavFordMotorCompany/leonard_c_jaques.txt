mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
mr.
chief
justice,
if
it
please
the
court.
in
1962,
an
intoxicated
seaman
was
going
back
to
his
ship
in
louisiana.
he
fell
asleep
on
a
railroad
track
before
he
got
there.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
yes,
your
honor.
the
record
shows,
in
this
particular
case,
i
am
citing
and
i
am
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
got
to
the
a
railroad
track,
couldn’t
get
to
the
ship,
laid
down
on
railroad
track.
the
train
came
along,
amputated
both
legs.
the
question
arose,
what
duty
does
the
shipowner
have
with
regard
to
payment
of
maintenance
and
cure.
the
fifth
circuit
held,
in
myles
versus
quinn
menhaden
fisheries
inc.
302
f.2d
146,
that
the
duty
of
the
shipowner
did
terminate
at
the
time
that
there
was
provided
for
the
seaman,
a
fitting
of
artificial
legs.
the
sixth
circuit
would
hold,
in
1975,
that
there
was
no
duty
at
all
to
provide
any
cure,
any
maintenance
for
the
seaman.
in
its
holding
on
the
vella
case,
the
sixth
circuit
had
indicated,
that
one
who
was
afflicted
by
trauma
with
a
vestibular
labyrinthine
disorder
had
actually
reached
the
maximum
cure,
at
the
time
that
the
incident
occurred.
this
is
borne
in
the
opinion
on
page
29
of
the
brief
--
of
the
appendix.
and
there
the
court
stated,
“the
record
in
this
case
did
not
permit
an
inference
other
than,
that
plaintiff’s
condition
was
permanent
immediately
after
the
accident.”
to
look
at
the
sixth
circuit
holding,
with
regard
to
this
case,
it
would
necessarily
follow
that
there
could
be
no
manner
by
which
a
seaman
who
had
reached
that
point
of
maximum
medical
cure,
as
was
enunciated
by
this
court
in
farrell
versus
united
states,
where
there
had
been,
in
fact
a
declaration,
that
there
had
been
a
maximum
cure
rendered
for
the
treatment
of
the
seaman.
for
indeed
if,
once
that
particular
declaration
is
made
by
a
medical
authority,
according
to
the
sixth
circuit,
relating
back,
the
very
onset
of
the
incident
which
created
the
injury
or
the
illness
would
have
been
in
fact
incurable.
well,
looking
on
these
cases
relative
to
maintenance
and
cure,
the
cure
aspect,
doesn’t
mean
cure
in
a
medical
sense
solely,
it
means
care.
there
a
question
arises
to
what
extent
and
this
court
has
never
indicated
that
where
there
is
treatment
to
provide
a
cure
of
an
amelioratory
nature,
that
would
not
permit
a
seaman
to
come
within
the
scope
of
the
doctrine
and
this
court
has
never
addressed
itself
to
that
very
particular
question.
i
recognize
that
in
farrell
and
also
in
vaughan
versus
atkinson
that
the
majority
held
that
a
seaman
is
not
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure
payments
for
a
lifetime.
what
indeed
the
circuits
have
interpreted
farrell
since
it
came
down
in
1949,
the
third
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
has
consistently
held
and
i
must
point
out,
that
these
two
circuits,
the
third
and
the
fifth,
are
quite
active
maritime
circuits,
much
more
than
the
sixth
circuit.
but
with
regard
to
the
test,
i
cite
the
case
of
smith
versus
dale
hart,
inc,
it's
315
f.supp.
1162,
or
in
1969
amc
2400,
i
cite
it
for
the
language.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
maximum
medical
care
does
not
mean
to
the
point
where
a
seamen
has
the
ability
to
return
to
work,
but
to
restore
a
seamen
to
the
status
of
a
functional
human
being.
now
that
case
is
very
similar
to
the
case
of
vella.
an
action
was
brought
for
the
negligence
under
the
jones
act,
in
addition
to
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel.
it
was
held
that
there
was
no
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel,
no
negligence
under
the
jones
act.
the
third
count,
however,
was
with
regard
to
maintenance
and
cure.
in
that
case
the
seamen
suffered
from
a
ruematoyed
arthritic
condition,
degenerative
spinal
condition.
the
orthopedic
surgeon
said,
i
can
operate
on
him,
i
can
cure
him
to
the
point
where
he
can
go
back
to
sea,
but
i
can
cause
him
to
be
alleviated
of
pain
and
nothing
more.
and
there
the
court
held
that
this
would
be
compensable
and
this
is
in
line
with
the
cases
of
third
circuit
such
as
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
indeed
your
honor.
indeed,
because
embodied
within
that
question,
as
it
was
framed,
would
be
the
question
as
to
when
and
what
time
does
the
seamen
--
the
scope
and
duration,
under
what
circumstance
does
he
come
within
the
scope
and
once
he
is
within
the
scope
or
what
is
the
duration?
and
here
in
the
sixth
circuit
opinion,
under
a
very
novel
pronouncement,
the
sixth
circuit
said,
there
is
more
than
a
one
step
proposition,
such
as
this
court
held
in
the
osceola
back
in
1898,
where
a
seamen
was
required
to
show
that
he
actually
sustained
injury
or
became
ill
in
the
service
of
the
vessel
and
at
that
time,
it
meant
your
honor,
that
he
must
have
been
actually
performing
work
activities
on
the
vessel.
now,
this
court
in
the
calmar
versus
taylor
case
extended
that
and
put
the
seamen
ashore
and
where
he
is
in
fact
injured
ashore
or
sustains
injury
ashore,
that
is
construed
to
be
in
the
service
of
the
ship,
even
though
it's
on
a
personal
basis.
now
this
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
indeed
he
was,
but
the
sixth
circuit
held
that,
that
wasn't
enough,
that
showing
in
and
off
itself
is
not
enough
your
honor.
the
sixth
circuit
held,
just
as
the
shipowner
argued
that,
he
must
not
only
show
that
he
was
injured
while
in
the
service
of
the
vessel
and
indeed
there
is
no
question
and
they
concede
that,
the
shipowner
indeed
concedes
that
he
was
injured,
that
the
jury
did
find
that
he
was
injured
while
in
the
service
of
the
vessel.
but
the
sixth
circuit
holds
that
the
seaman
has
an
additional
duty.
that
he
must
go
forward
and
show
that
he
has
that
there
--
whatever
he
is
afflicted
with
is
curable.
this
is
why,
it
is
indeed
important
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
this
additional
step
is
required
in
accordance
with
the
law.
take
that
situation
alone;
a
seaman
who
is
saddled
with
responsibility
to
go
forward
to
get
medical
authority
to
indicate
that
whatever
he
is
afflicted
with
is
curable
in
this
day
with
the
special
problems
that
the
physicians
have,
it
would
be
very
difficult.
when
i
say
problem,
i
am
talking
about
physicians
having
problem
with
regard
to
malpractice
insurance
and
for
a
physician
to
diagnose
someone
with
a
specific
type
of
disability
and
for
the
shipowner
to
require
the
physician
to
indicate
that
he
does
in
fact
have
a
curable
ailment,
maybe
construed
by
doctors
as
a
contract
to
cure
him
with
the
inherent;
and
i
don't
mean
this
disparagingly
but
it
would
be
inherent
tendency
of
medical
practitioners
to
act
on
a
conservative
basis,
it's
doubtful
that
any
seaman
could
ever
get
any
doctor
to
make
such
a
declaration.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
maintenance
means
sustenance,
cure
means
care.
it
has
been
established
by
collective
bargaining
contracts
that
this
is
set
at
a
rate
of
$8
per
day,
rather
unrealistic
because
it
is
supposed
to
be
the
kind
of
care
and
treatment
and
lodging
that
he
would
have
received
aboard
the
ship
no
better
and
no
worse.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
on
the
assumption
that
he
is
disabled
--
more
than
assumption
your
honor,
but
then
indeed,
the
fact
that
he
is
disabled
and
unfit
for
sea
duty.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
the
(inaudible)
hospital,
the
united
states
public
health
service
hospital
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
that's
covered
by
statute
your
honor
and
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
he
gets
maintenance
and
cure
while
he
is
in
an
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
that's
true.
he
is
not
entitled
to
payments
until
he
is
an
outpatient,
if
in
fact,
he
had
been
interned
in
the
medical
facility,
often
times
they
are
not,
often
times
they
are
simply
treated
as
outpatients
but
unfit
for
duty.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
i
would
be
--
well,
with
regard
to
maintenance
and
cure
benefits
to
not
--
to
my
client,
i
would
be
satisfied
for
maintenance
and
cure
payments
up
to
the
time
where
there
had
been
a
diagnosis
and
declaration
by
a
medical
authority
that
the
disease
was
in
fact
incurable
and
that
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
if
that
had
come
within
a
week
of
the
accident,
i
must
say
your
honor,
when
i
answered
this
question,
i
had
put
it
on
strictly
the
hypothetical
basis,
or
predicated
on
exactly
as
you
phrase
it.
now
if
it
happened
within
one
week,
i
would
say
that
the
test
would
go
to
what
i
had
set
forth
in
my
brief
on
page
17
which
i
and
i
did
propose
a
test
to
show
as
follows.
a
seaman
who
has
contracted
by
trauma,
but
i
will
change
that,
a
seaman
who
has
become
ill
and
the
illness
or
injury
is
of
a
permanent
nature,
while
in
the
service
of
the
vessel,
comes
within
the
scope
of
maintenance
and
cure
benefits
and
shall
continue
to
be
entitled
to
those
benefits
until
cured
or
until
the
disease
is
diagnosed
and
declared
by
medical
authority
that
the
maximum
degree
of
improvement
of
the
seaman's
health
has
been
reached.
now,
that
would
take
care
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
well,
the
sixth
circuit
said,
it
was
reached
when
it
happened,
and
that's
not
keeping
within
the
purpose
of
the
doctrine.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
that's
what
sixth
circuit
said.
the
sixth
circuit
would
go
back
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
i
follow
this.
i
would
follow
your
honor
what
this
court
has
set
forth
particularly
in
the
farrell
versus
united
states
case
and
in
that
case
it
says,
this
court
adapted
a
treaty
--
well,
the
draft
convention
which
really
was
a
treaty
in
1939
and
that
treaty
is
set
forth
in
the
brief
in
the
precise
language
on
page
11.
the
shipowner
shall
be
liable
to
defray
the
expense
of
medical
care
and
maintenance
until
the
sick
or
injured
seaman
has
been
cured
or
until
the
sickness
or
incapacity
has
been
declared
of
a
permanent
character.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
absolutely,
your
honor.
this
court
has
never
made
a
dichotomy
with
regard
to
maintenance
and
cure
benefits
with
reference
to
high
seas
and
the
great
lakes.
i
concede
your
honor
that
this
particular
treaty
did
not
have
bearing
on
great
lake
seaman
indeed
by
its
language,
it
meant
only
persons
on
the
high
seas,
but
when
this
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
i
think
that
the
jury
verdict
under
the
proper
test
and
the
instructions
of
the
court
was
not
correct.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
i
simply
indicate
here
that
the
question
as
to
the
additur
of
the
verdict
was
not
brought
before
the
court
of
appeals,
but
i
submit
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
well,
i
concede
your
honor
that
this
is
a
circumstance
where
the
court
may
under
the
proper
condition
be
loath
to
grant
that
which
was
not
sought?
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
that's
correct,
and
that's
because
of
the
test
that
the
court
has
established.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
i
realize
but
the
court
in
retrospect
would
recognize
that
the
sixth
circuit
would
not
lend
any
credence
or
even
address
itself
to
that
proposition,
had
it
been
raised
in
the
appellate
court
below.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
i
don't
make
an
advance
evaluation
and
i
agree
now
under
the
circumstances
indeed
it
is
questionable
whether
or
not
this
court
would
grant
the
relief
sought
particularly
with
regard
to
additur
of
the
verdict
related
to
the
maintenance
and
cure.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
well,
that
was
raised,
the
attorney's
fees
was
raised
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
that's
correct.
the
trial
court
denied
the
attorney.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
i
did
not
appeal
that
to
the
sixth
circuit.
the
two-step
criteria
of
the
sixth
circuit,
and
really
what
the
sixth
circuit
is
saying,
first
the
seaman
must
show
that
he
was
injured
while
in
the
service
of
the
vessel,
and
then
he
must
show
that
whatever
cure
he
undertakes
that
will
be
the
--
that
will
result
into
his
return
to
a
fit
for
duty
status.
this
is
novel.
this
is
something
this
court
has
never
held.
with
regard
to
the
duration
the
sixth
circuit
has
criticized
in
the
footnote,
the
third
circuit
relative
to
what
was
held
in
ward
versus
the
barge
line
where
the
sixth
--
where
the
third
circuit
indicated
that
maintenance
and
cure
would
go
on
as
so
long
as
there
was
some
type
of
mandatory
relief.
and
the
question
i
would
pose
would
be
how
then
can
the
sixth
circuit
square
itself
with
farrell
in
this
particular
case,
because
farrell
has
indicated
that
maintenance
and
cure
must
be
paid
until
there
had
been
a
declaration
by
medical
authority
that
the
disease
was
incurable
and
that
was
not
done
until
the
time
of
the
trial.
but,
sixth
circuit
did
not
even
allow
the
two
years
that
was
granted
by
the
jury.
i
will
reserve
time.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
matters
posed
to
my
brother,
in
further
response,
in
another
situation
where
a
seaman
is
inflicted
with
illness
and
is
put
ashore
and
under
a
circumstance
such
as
this
where
a
vestibular
labyrinthine
disorder
is
of
a
permanent
nature,
incurable
and
he
is
put
ashore
and
incurs
medical
expenses.
i
think
mr.
mundell
has
indicated
well
the
shipowner
though
his
benevolence
even
though
it
had
no
obligation
would
make
those
payments.
i
submit
that
i
would
not
place
much
stock
on
the
benevolence
of
a
ship
owner
who
had
no
duty
to
make
payments
for
medical
expenses
and
i
think
that
that
really
is
the
crucial
part
of
the
issue
of
this
case.
when
liability
of
a
shipowner
to
pay
a
seaman's
maintenance
and
cure
commences
and
when
it
ends,
the
sixth
circuit
has
taken
the
bold
position.
and
the
position
which
unlocks
--
submit
humanism
that
if
the
incident
renders
the
seaman
unfit
for
duty
at
the
occurrence
and
if
it
is
found
to
be
prominent,
then
the
shipowner
has
no
liability
at
all.
the
maximum
cure
occurred,
in
the
words
of
the
sixth
circuit,
the
moment
that
the
trauma
was
inflicted.
the
shipowner
has
stated
here
in
response
to
a
question
with
regard
to
this
court
having
stated
in
farrell
versus
united
stated
that
there
is
no
payment
for
maintenance
and
cure
when
the
cure
is
palliative
treatment.
now,
i
say
this,
my
brother
has
indicated
in
his
brief
on
page
14
a
quotation
stating
that
the
rule
in
effect
as
stated
by
this
court
and
then
he
cites
--
and
then
he
recites,
“now,
i'm
sure
that
this
inadvertence
on
mr.
mundell's
part
but
this
court
did
not
make
ever
that
statement.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
statement
came
from
a
texas
court
--
texas
state
court
in
the
case
of
rey
lewis
versus
isthmian
lines
and
that
was
the
state
of
texas
--
it
came
out
of
the
1968
amc
1688.
and
so
i
submit
that
this
court
has
not
made
such
a
pronouncement
relative
to
palliative
treatment
not
being
within
the
purview
of
the
duration
of
liability
of
a
shipowner
to
pay
maintenance
and
cure.
just
further,
the
united
state
public
health
service
has
a
statutory
duty
to
provide
care
for
ill
and
injured
seamen
who
are
afflicted
during
the
service
of
the
vessel.
there
is,
however,
a
policy
of
the
united
states
public
health
service
that
if
they
find
the
seaman
fit
--for
duty,
and
then
60
days
expires
or
90
days
or
whatever
period
that
they
have
established,
expires
where
the
seaman
has
not
been
active,
then
he
is
no
longer
eligible
and
that
was
a
situation
with
vella
and
vella
thus
became
ineligible
after
that
period
of
days
and
at
that
time
it
could
have
been
60
or
90,
but
whatever,
it
was
period
of
days,
and
he
was
no
longer
eligible
for
public
health
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
never,
ever
since.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
he
is
about
44,
45
in
that
age
vicinity.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
well,
that
certainly
is
an
interesting
question
and
i
have
thought
about
this.
the
only
thing
that
i
can
say,
your
honor,
in
response
to
that
is
there
was
a
period,
approximately
in
that
period
of
time,
when
the
seaman
was
examined,
by
dr.
benitus
who
was
comparable
to
dr.
heil
and
he
is
a
specialist,
although
it
was
a
period
of
time
earlier,
actually
it
was
a
trifle
earlier
than
that
two
year
period.
now,
in
response
further
to
mr.
justice
brennan,
with
regard
to
the
seaman's
right
to
an
appropriate
period
of
time
and
other
matters
that
are
sought
as
relief
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
i
submit,
first
of
all,
that
this
court
has
declared
way
back,
following
justice
story's
declaration,
of
this
court
being,
well
a
seaman
is
a
ward
of
the
admiralty
court
and
as
such,
i
submit
that
it's
not
unprecedented
for
an
award
to
be
made
outside
of
the
area
of
issues
raised
below.
in
regard
to
the
matter
of
the
appropriate
order
to
issue
relative
to
judgment,
to
be
consistent
with
the
law
that
is
established
pertaining
to
the
duration,
maintenance
and
cure,
not
only
is
it
not
unprecedented
that
the
court
even
on
it's
own
motion
could
make
such
a
determination.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
i
submit
your
honor
and
this
is
my
impression
and
i
don't
have
--
it
is
my
impression
that
such
is
not
unprecedented.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
well,
i
do
not
at
this
time
have
the
case.
i
have
not
briefed
it.
if
the
court
would
direct,
i
would
submit
a
separate
brief
on
that
issue.
but
i
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
where
a
seaman
is
indeed
a
ward
of
the
admiralty
court
that
this
circumstance
could
be
effectuated.
but
no
matter,
the
pecuniary
moment,
the
amount
of
pecuniary
award
to
vella
may
not
be
a
great
moment,
but
the
significance
of
the
sixth
circuit
decision
if
left
to
stand
and
the
consequences
of
it,
would
be
of,
i
would
submit
grave
consequences.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
he
did
that
your
honor.
he
gave
the
instructions,
the
trial
judge
gave
the
instructions
consistent
with
the
holdings
of
the
third
circuit
and
the
holdings
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
i
had
previously
enunciated
and
brought
and
briefed
in
the
petition
of
the
brief
--
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
that's
correct,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
c.
jaques
that's
correct
and
the
judge
has
indicated
that
he
was
also
puzzled
at
that
particular
period.
thank
you.
