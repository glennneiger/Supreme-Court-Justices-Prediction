as
soon
as
that
was
diagnosed

it
was

it
always
have
been
incurable.
there
are
no
maintenance
and
cure.
justice

did
the
court
of
appeals
ever
passed
on
this
part
of
your
contention?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
it
is
whether
the
evidence
to
support
the
verdict?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
they
didn't
reverse
on
the
ground
you
are
urging
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
in
effect
rejected
that
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we've
got
two
courts
saying
that
there
was
evidence
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
trial
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
said
it
in
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
part
of
maintenance
and
cure?
justice
byron

just
for
the
good
of
the
order?
justice
byron

what
if
the
seaman
is
treated
at
home
by
a
doctor?
he's
incapacitated.
he's
at
home
like
a
lot
of
people
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
say
it's
with
a
back
and
finally
the
doctor
says,
we
just
can't
do
anything
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
meanwhile,
you
say,
he
gets
his
maintenance
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
turns
out
that
the
doctor
says,
this
is
all
--
since
he
left
his
ship,
he's
been
in
this
condition.
hopefully,
i
thought
maybe
i
could
do
something
but
i
can't.
so
why
wouldn't
you
argue
that
retroactively
he's
disentitled
to
any
maintenance
and
cure?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
finally
says
it's
incurable.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
from
the
fact
that
it
was
incurable
from
the
day
he
left
the
ship,
why
then
isn't
he
entitled
from
what
you've
just
said
up
to
that
date
short
of
--
fairly
to
appeal
the
jury
verdict
which
gave
him
less
to
make
this
incurable?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
call
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
not
here
anyway.
