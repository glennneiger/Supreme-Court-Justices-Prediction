the
actual
practice
now
for
an
injured
or
ill
seaman
go
into
a
public
hospital?
justice
potter
stewart
an
iah
hospital
in
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
public
health
hospital
and
that's
--
is
that
covered
generally
by
collective
bargaining
agreements
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
where
he
goes,
that's
where
he
gets
his
maintenance
and
cure
generally,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
unless
he
is
not
been
--
until
he
becomes
an
outpatient?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
your
argument
that
there
was
never
anything
wrong
with
him
or
that
whatever
he
did
have
wrong
with
him
by
way
of
an
illness
or
injury
didn't
occur
while
he
was
in
the
service
of
the
ship?
justice
potter
stewart
thereby
found
that
he
had
a
physical
condition
that
occurred
while
he
was
in
the
service
of
the
ship,
necessarily
if
the
instructions
were
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
found
that
as
a
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mundell.
justice
potter
stewart
take
the
case
that
your
brother
opened
with
yesterday.
let's
assume
that
a
seaman
has
both
of
his
legs
cut
off.
justice
potter
stewart
amputated
in
an
accident
in
the
service
of
the
ship.
now
clearly,
there
is
no
cure
for
that.
if
his
legs
are
gone,
they're
gone.
justice
potter
stewart
but
equally
clearly,
there
are
measures
that
can
be
taken
in
the
way
of
artificial
limbs
and
his
training
to
use
them
to
at
least
be
palliative
of
the
consequences
of
the
double
amputation.
but
would
it
be
your
claim
that
since
the
double
amputation
is
incurable
at
the
moment
it
occurs
that
there's
no
right
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
seaman
to
maintenance
and
cure?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
that's
what
your
argument
is
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
treatment
for
a
double
amputation.
you
can't
put
back
those
legs.
justice
potter
stewart
all
you
can
do
is
deal
with
the
symptoms
of
it.
justice
potter
stewart
then
wouldn't
likewise
the
treatment
here
consist
of
medicating
the
impact
of
the
symptoms
even
though
it's
not
curable.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
distinguish
between
medical
treatment
that
is
curative
and
palliative?
isn't
there
a
gray
zone
often
as
to
whether
has
one
or
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suspect
that
oftentimes
a
position
isn't
able
to
draw
that
line
of
distinction
with
great
accuracy.
justice
potter
stewart
but
palliative
treatment
could
make
the
patient
more
comfortable
and
perhaps
prolong
life.
but
that
would
not
be
included?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
you
mr.
mundell?
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
it
that
--
on
what
exact
date
was
it
that
dr.
heil
diagnosed
--
announced
his
diagnosis?
justice
potter
stewart
that
this
was
incurable.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
that
date
up
to
which
the
jury
awarded
maintenance
and
cure?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
did
anyone
else
--
did
anyone
other
than
dr.
heil
ever
address
the
question
whether
or
not
the
disease
was
incurable?
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
date
that
he
did
was
march
27,
1972?
justice
potter
stewart
why
doesn't
that
fix
the
point
up
to
which
he's
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
june
29,
1968
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
fact
is,
no
one
knew
that
put
in
your
record,
isn't
that
so?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
diagnosis
of
dr.
heil
is
correct,
then
the
u.s.
public
health
service
pronouncements
that
he
was
fit
for
duty
were
incorrect?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me,
that's
a
jury
argument.
the
jury
decided
against
you
on
this?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
take
it
your
position
is
that
if
the
disease
cannot
be
cured,
then
though
it
takes
10
years
to
determine
that,
he
still
is
not
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
you're
wrong
about
that,
mr.
mundell,
in
any
event,
i
take
it,
even
if
the
petitioner
were
entitled
up
to
march
27,
1972,
the
jury
awarded
only
up
to
some
time
in
1970,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
never
appealed
from
the
jury
limitations
in
1970.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
take
it
your
position
would
be
in
any
event,
he's
entitled
to
nothing
more
than
what
the
jury
gave
him.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
it
is
payable
in
that
form,
is
what
you
really
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
they
wouldn't
--
it's
not
your
claim
that
he
would
have
to
pay
for
that
three-week
period?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
at
taxpayer's,
not
shipowner's
expense?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
the
thing
were
so
--
such
an
emergency
that
he
were
taken
to
a
private
hospital.
he
wasn't
near
a
public
health
institution,
would
he
have
to
disgorge
then
or
he
himself
have
to
pay
if
it
turns
out
that
his
situation
is
incurable?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
during
the
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
actually
after
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
just
left
his
job
as
a
seaman,
did
he
get
another
job
somewhere?
justice
potter
stewart
how
old
the
man
is?
justice
potter
stewart
the
instructions
of
the
trial
judge
are
not
in
the
--
don't
seem
to
be
in
the
appendix
with
respect
to
maintenance
and
cure.
i
was
wondering,
did
he
gave
instructions
that
would
have
rationally
permitted
the
jury
to
return
the
verdict
it
did
for
two
years
of
maintenance
and
cure?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
instructions
were
given
in
court
under
your
theory
of
what
the
law
is,
right?
the
instructions
reflected
your
theory
of
what
the
law
is?
justice
potter
stewart
despite
that
the
jury
returned
this
verdict
of
arbitrarily
two
years
for
the
maintenance
and
cure?
