mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
case
of
the
bouker
no.
2,
241
fed.
831,
the
court
stated
at
page
835,
the
limits
of
care
or
cure
both
as
to
kind
of
treatment
and
time
of
continuance
must
always
depend
on
the
facts
of
each
particular
case.
respondent
in
this
case
contends
the
facts
at
bar
are
of
special
significance
in
the
resolution
of
the
issue
now
before
the
court.
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
bear
with
me
momentarily
as
i
recite
briefly
the
facts,
because
i
believe
they
have
a
very
special
significance.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
an
oiler
on
the
s.s.
robert
s.
mcnamara.
he
claimed
that
while
replacing
a
deck
plate
in
the
lower
engine
room,
he
slipped
and
fell,
and
bumped
his
head.
there
was
some
doubt
as
to
whether
the
petitioner
reported
that
action
at
that
time.
thereafter,
the
petitioner
claimed
that
he
suffered
from
dizziness,
headaches,
imbalance,
and
fear
of
falling,
but
he
continued
to
perform
his
regular
duties
until
june
28,
1968.
the
alleged
accident
occurred
some
time,
a
date
unknown
to
the
petitioner
in
early
april,
1968.
that
means,
he
was
on
the
ship
for
a
period
of
almost
19
days
doing
his
regular
work.
on
june
28
the
petitioner
was
discharged
from
the
vessel
for
failing
to
obey
the
orders
of
a
superior
officer.
when
the
vessel
arrived
back
at
dearborn
following
day
on
june
29,
he
was
paid
off
and
left
the
vessel.
during
the
course
of
the
preparation
of
his
discharge
papers,
the
third
assistant
engineer
was
doing
this,
the
petitioner
said
and
informed
the
third
assistant
engineer
that
he
had
fallen
back
in
april,
1968
and
an
accident
report
was
prepared.
petitioner
also
requested
and
was
issued
a
master
certificate
permitting
him
or
a
hospital
ticket
permitting
him
to
go
to
the
united
states
public
health
service
hospital
where
free
care
is
provided
for
a
merchant
seaman.
immediately,
upon
leaving
the
vessel,
the
petitioner
was
examined
at
respondent's
plant
hospital.
this
hospital
is
staffed
by
15
physicians
and
89
nurses
and
headed
by
dr.
charles
david
litterick
(ph).
based
upon
the
information
supplied
by
the
petitioner,
dr.
litterick
gave
a
diagnosis
of
alleged
left
parietal
contusion.
in
as
much
as
the
petitioner
denied
visual
difficulties,
nausea,
vomiting,
dizziness,
or
headaches
in
the
romberg
test
which
is
the
test
where
you
close
our
eyes,
and
if
you
sway
back
and
forth
to
indicate
you
have
a
balance
problem,
that
test
was
negative
and
similar
test
finger-to-finger
test
with
your
eyes
closed,
finger
to
nose
with
your
eyes
closed;
again
a
balance
test,
these
tests
were
all
normal.
dr.
litterick
ruled
out
vestibular
damage,
but
based
upon
the
petitioner's
description
that
there
was
something
electrical
in
his
head,
decided
that
complaint
could
relate
to
a
tiny
nerve
branch
contusion.
this
he
considered
minor
and
he
ordered
a
cold
pack
applied
to
the
area
where
he
described
his
harder
electrical
sensation
and
discharged
him
to
enable
to
work.
from
that
day,
june
29,
1968,
petitioner
went
to
the
us
public
health
service
hospital
in
detroit
on
three
occasions,
july
9,
july
16
and
september
30.
on
each
of
those
occasions,
he
was
declared
fit
for
duty.
it
is
to
be
noted
in
the
appendix
which
sets
forth
these
visits
to
the
public
health
service
hospital,
that
the
petitioner
when
he
went
there,
if
he
denied
he
had
sustaining
the
unconsciousness,
he
had
no
headaches,
dizziness,
or
other
neural
problems
and
nothing
of
an
objective
nature
was
found.
the
final
day
that
he
was
there,
final
visit
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
both,
if
the
court,
please.
it
was
our
contention
that
when
the
man
left
the
ship,
he
was
fit
for
duty.
now,
the
jury
in
this
case,
did
give
the
man
two
years
maintenance.
there
was
never
a
specific
finding.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
well,
that's
why
if
the
court
please
we
appealed
the
maintenance
verdict.
we
felt
there
was
no
basis
for
this
jury
to
grant
maintenance
and
cure
to
this
man.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
on
as
to
whether
or
not
he
actually
was
fit
for
duty
or
not
fit
for
duty?
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
i
think
the
words
of
the
court
were
presumably
the
jury
found
that
the
man
had
sustained
an
injury
in
part
of
ship.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
i
would
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
oh!
yes.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
very
well
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
conclusion
of
yesterday
afternoon's
session,
i
was
reciting
the
facts
of
this
case
and
i
will
not
go
over
those
again
for
they
are
set
forth
in
the
counter
statement
of
facts
in
our
brief.
i
will
continue
by
saying
that
in
february
of
1970,
the
petitioner
filed
a
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
michigan,
southern
division
with
a
count
for
negligence
under
the
jones
act
and
a
count
alleging
unseaworthiness
of
the
vessel
under
the
general
maritime
law
and
a
count
for
maintenance
and
cure.
the
jury
decided
adversely
to
the
petitioner
on
the
issue
of
liability,
finding
the
accident
was
due
to
his
sole
negligence.
they
also
found
that
petitioner
was
entitled
to
a
maintenance
and
cure
award
for
the
period
from
june
29,
1968,
the
day
he
left
the
vessel
until
june
29,
1970.
respondent
moved
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
and
petitioner
moved
for
attorney's
fees
and
interests
and
costs.
both
motions
were
denied
by
the
district
court.
petitioner
then
appealed
to
the
sixth
circuit
as
to
the
first
cause
of
action
pertaining
to
the
negligence
under
the
jones
act
and
to
unseaworthiness
under
the
general
maritime
law
of
the
jury
verdict
of
no
cause
for
action.
respondent
filed
with
an
appeal
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
maintenance
and
cure
award.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
jury
verdict
of
no
cause
for
action
as
to
the
liability
question
and
reversed
as
to
the
maintenance
and
cure
question.
on
appeal,
respondent
argued
at
the
trial
level
that
petitioner
went
to
great
lengths
to
show
that
he
suffered
the
vestibular
disorder
or
condition
when
he
left
the
vessel
on
june
28
or
june
29,
1968
and
that
such
was
due
to
the
accident
which
he
alleged
occurred
in
early
april
of
1968.
quoting
from
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit
which
states
respondent's
position
with
succinctness,
we
read,
“the
defendant
contends
that
the
plaintiff’s
injury
was
permanent
from
the
date
of
the
accident
and
was
never
susceptible
of
curative
treatment.”
dr.
heil
testified
that
although
he
could
not
determine
from
his
examination
what
had
caused
the
vestibular
disorder,
a
severe
blow
to
the
head
could
have
caused
his
problem.
presumably,
the
jury
concluded
that
it
was
plaintiff's
fault
that
caused
the
disorder
and
the
disabling
dizziness
and
headaches.
however,
the
evidence
clearly
shows
that
a
vestibular
disorder
is
not
a
condition
that
can
be
cured
or
improved
by
treatment.
when
asked
whether
plaintiff
might
be
cured
by
treatment,
dr.
heil,
testified,
“no,
not
really.
treatment
is
primarily
symptomatic
for
this
condition.
that
is,
people
with
a
vestibular
disorder
are
apt
to
have
intermittent
episodes
of
dizziness
which
on
occasion
are
somewhat
more
severe.
treatment
is
limited
to
those
times
when
the
patient
is
particularly
dizzy.
they
can
obtain
some
symptomatic
relief
with
medication.
other
than
that,
there
is
no
specific
cure
or
treatment.”
no
evidence
was
introduced
in
conflict
with
this
conclusion
of
dr.
heil.
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
permit
an
inference
other
than
that
plaintiff's
condition
was
permanent
immediately
after
the
accident.
it
is
not
even
alleged
that
plaintiff
has
ever
received
treatment
for
the
condition
itself
although
he
has
received
medicine
for
the
symptoms
of
dizziness
and
headaches,
that
one
may
require
or
be
helped
by
treatment
for
the
symptoms
of
a
disorder
does
not
qualify
him
for
maintenance
and
cure,
farrell
versus
united
stated
at
519.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
i
would
not
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
there
is
no
treatment
for
the
vestibular
disorder.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
but
i
think
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
a
reasonable
conclusion
i
would
think
your
honor
would
be
that
the
treatment
would
consist
of
the
fitting
of
the
artificial
limbs.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
i
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
double
amputation,
once
the
legs
are
fitted,
the
maintenance
cure
would
end.
in
this
case,
maintenance
and
cure
where
he's
just
being
treated
for
his
headaches
and
dizziness
could
go
on
ad
infinitum
and
the
cases
are
quite
clear
that
maintenance
and
cure
is
not
appendant
for
life
and
that's
what
it
would
amount.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
i
think,
if
the
court
pleases,
calmar
versus
taylor
says
that
the
seaman
is
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time
after
the
voyage
during
which
time
care
and
nursing
might
bring
him
to
a
point
of
maximum
cure
for
his
condition.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
i
think,
if
the
court
please
that
the
interpretation
of
the
word
palliative
in
the
cases
has
been
stated
to
mean
to
ease
without
curing.
that
answers
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
likely,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
it's
--
the
voyages
on
the
great
lakes,
your
honor
are
very
short.
none
of
the
ships
to
my
knowledge
have
doctors
aboard.
on
occasion,
on
an
extreme
case,
the
coast
guard
will
come
up
by
helicopter
and
take
the
man
off
the
ship.
but
otherwise,
because
of
the
shortness
of
the
voyages
which
may
be
anywhere
from
let's
say
four
hours
to
toledo
from
detroit
to
two
and
a
half
days
to
duluth,
they
rely
on
either
putting
the
man
ashore
at
the
port
when
they
arrive
or
at
various
ports
between
the
port
of
departure
and
port
of
destination.
for
example,
leaving
detroit
going
to
duluth,
a
man
might
be
put
off
at
sault
ste.
marie
to
the
public
health
doctor
there.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
at
that
particular
time,
the
robert
s.
mcnamara
was
engaged
solely
in
trips
between
detroit
and
toledo.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
back
and
forth
from
detroit
to
toledo
which
is
in
good
weather
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
sir,
60
miles
i
believe.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
--
and
he
could
receive
treatment
at
either
end.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
it
depends
on
the
facts
of
the
case
of
course.
but
i
believe
that
the
courts
have
looked
at
the
nature
of
the
treatment
such
as
mr.
justice
stewart
mentioned,
the
man
with
the
legs
off.
they
very
likely
would
permit
the
maintenance
and
cure
until
a
man
was
fitted
for
artificial
limbs.
in
the
case
of
a
man
with
let's
say
chronic
bronchitis,
for
example,
the
court
says
there's
nothing
more
that
can
be
done
for
him.
he's
reached
maximum
cure
and
they
stop
it.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
at
point
where
no
further
treatment
can
improve
a
condition,
that's
the
statement
from
the
cases.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no
sir.
farrell
says
not.
along
the
same
lines
of
the
questions
put
to
me
a
moment
ago,
in
its
opinion,
the
court
set
forth
the
criteria
for
the
payment
of
maintenance
and
cure
which
is
in
accordance
with
the
overwhelming
weight
of
judicial
authority.
in
discussing
the
applicable
law,
the
court
stated,
“under
the
maritime
law
of
the
united
states,
a
shipowner
is
liable
to
a
seaman
for
maintenance
and
cure
regardless
of
the
negligence
of
either
party
if
the
seaman
is
injured
while
on
the
service
of
the
ship
citing
aguilar
versus
standard
oil
318
u.s.
724
1943.
the
duty
of
the
shipowner
to
maintain
and
care
for
the
seaman
exists
only
until
a
seaman
is
cured
to
the
maximum
extent
medically
possible,
farrell
versus
united
states
336
u.s.
511,
518
1949.”
in
brief,
once
the
seaman
reaches
“maximum
medical
recovery”,
the
shipowner's
obligation
to
provide
maintenance
and
cure
ceases,

versus
atkinson

mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
march
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
i
believe
it
was
march
27,
1972,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
they
awarded
maintenance
up
to
june
29
of
1970.
the
reason
i
recited
the
facts
of
the
case
is
there
seems
to
be
no
basis
or
justification
for
the
period
selected
by
the
jury
for
the
payment
of
maintenance.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
because
i
believe
even
if
the
man
had
been
examined
the
day
he
left
the
ship
and
the
vestibular
disorder
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
the
vestibular
disorder
found,
there
was
no
cure
then.
there
was
no
cure
when
dr.
heil
diagnosed
it
as
incurable.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
that
it
was
incurable?
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
your
honor
because
the
respondent's
doctor
and
the
public
health
on
three
occasions
declared
the
man
fit
for
duty
and
nothing
was
heard
from
the
man
again
until
february
of
1970
when
suit
was
instituted.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
i
would
say
so.
i
would
qualify
that
with
this
remark.
if
the
court
please,
on
the
last
visit
on
september
30
of
1968,
the
public
health
doctor
said
if
symptoms
persist,
the
patient
should
return
and
a
complete
workup
would
be
performed.
the
man
never
returned.
it's
difficult
to
say
at
this
point
if
the
man
had
returned
if
they
would
not
have
conducted
this
test
that
would've
found
the
condition.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
that's
right,
there
was
no
appeal
on
the
jury
award.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
absolutely.
our
position
is
he
is
entitled
to
nothing.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
your
honor
because
maintenance
and
cure
is
not
payable
when
the
seaman
is
an
inpatient
in
a
hospital
because
he
is
in
effect
receiving
his
maintenance
and
cure.
he's
being
cared
for
there.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
sir,
in
other
words,
the
shipowner
is
not
paying
it.
it's
being
provided
him
by
the
public
health
service.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
sir.
public
health
hospitals
are
available
to
merchant
seamen
free
of
charge
because
initially,
the
public
health
hospitals
were
established
with
moneys
provided
by
the
merchant
seamen
at
the
initial
inception
of
the
public
health
hospitals
and
commonly
referred
to
as
the
marine
hospitals.
so
from
that
time
on,
they've
been
entitled
to
free
care
public
health.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
if
the
man
is
taken
off
the
ship
to
a
hospital
other
than
the
public
health,
public
health
has
told
the
shipowner
to
advise
them
immediately
and
they
will
authorize
the
attention.
but
if
for
some
reason,
the
public
health
is
not
notified,
the
shipowner
will
pick
it
up.
i
would
say
from
my
own
principle,
they
have
on
many
occasions
paid
for
private
hospital
care
where
the
public
health
for
one
reason
or
another
would
not
pick
up
the
tab.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
it's
--
it
would
be
an
addition
to
the
maintenance,
your
honor.
the
shipowner
would
just
assume
that
--
that
cost.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
i
have
seen
cases
such
as
that,
your
honor.
the
shipowner
will
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
if
the
doctor
says
he's
reached
the
point
of
maximum
cure
or
maximum
hospital
benefits,
then
the
case
would
say
the
maintenance
and
cure
ceases
but
if
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
the
doctor
sends
a
letter
to
the
shipowner
saying
this
man
is
under
my
care.
he's
not
fit
for
duty,
can't
return
to
work,
the
shipowner
will
pay
the
maintenance.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
because
up
to
that
time,
the
doctor
thought
he
could
do
something
and
he
was
treating
him.
but
the
point
when
the
doctor
said
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
then
the
maintenance
ends.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
then
in
effect
the
man
has
been
paid
money
to
which
he
was
not
entitled.
but
i
have
never
seen
a
case
where
they
tried
to
recover
that
money.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
right.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
approximately.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
just
prior
to
the
trial
and
at
the
trial.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
i
think,
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
if
we
had
in
fact
paid
the
man
the
maintenance,
it
would
just
be
money
down
the
drain.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
we
had
not
paid
it
because
the
man
had
been
declared
fit
for
duty
on
four
occasions
and
nothing
was
heard
from
him
until
the
date
of
trial.
pardon
me,
until
the
date
the
suit
was
filed.
but
if
the
man
was
in
fact,
not
fit
for
duty
when
he
left
the
ship,
his
condition
was
in
fact
not
curable
when
he
left
the
ship,
then
the
man
is
not
entitled
to
maintenance
and
cure
under
the
case.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
yes,
that
was
the
petitioner's
doctor.
he
is
a
neurologist.
he
examined
him.
he
found
a
positive
romberg
test.
as
i
mentioned
yesterday,
that's
the
test
where
the
man
stands
with
his
eyes
closed
and
there's
a
swaying
which
indicates
a
balance
problem
and
he
said
that
he
thought
there
was
vestibular
damage.
he
didn't
know
whether
it
was
permanent
or
not.
he
would
refer
it
to
an
ear
specialist
which
dr.
heil
was.
i
might
also
add
that
in
january
of
1970,
petitioner
was
examined
by
dr.
jimmy
benitez
who
conducted
this
sophisticated
electronystagmography
test
which
is
a
test
that
determines
the
vestibular
disorder.
at
that
time
in
january
1970
and
this
is
the
petitioner's
doctor,
he
found
the
disorder
in
january
1970.
when
he
had
him
examined
by
dr.
heil
in
1972
in
preparation
for
trial,
he
referred
him
back
to
dr.
benitez
because
he's
an
expert
in
detroit
on
this
particular
test
and
again,
dr.
benitez
found
vestibular
disorder.
dr.
benitez
was
never
called
by
petitioner
at
trial
and
had
he
been,
he
would
have
had
to
say
that
the
condition
was
incurable
in
1970,
if
we
are
to
believe
dr.
heil's
testimony
which
is
unrefuted
on
the
record.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
we
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
because
we
had
dr.
heil
and
we
had
dr.
benitez'
records.
i
might
just
conclude
if
the
court
please
by
saying
that
the
facts
of
the
case
at
bar
are
such
as
call
for
a
denial
of
the
payment
of
maintenance
and
cure
in
any
amount
for
the
simple
and
cogent
reason
that
petitioner's
condition
was
incurable
at
the
point
of
inception.
as
to
the
attorney's
fees
requested
in
the
petition
which
is
an
issue
not
granted
by
this
court,
i
would
simply
refer
the
court
to
the
decision
of
the
district
judge
who
denied
the
attorney's
fees
on
the
grounds
that
the
shipowner
--
mr.
john
a.
mundell,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
