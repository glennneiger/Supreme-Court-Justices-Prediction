justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
show
he
was
intoxicated
mr.
jaques?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
got
to
the
railroad
track
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
jaques
could
i
translate
this
into
the
facts
of
your
case,
your
third
cause
of
action,
of
course,
is
rather
wide
open
and
it's
cost
for
relief,
but
what
would
you
be
satisfied
with
the
per
dime
up
to
the
time
of
the
rendition
of
the
medical
judgment
of
the
inner
ear
problem?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
that
it
had
come
within
a
week
of
the
accident?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(voice
overlap)
until
that
diagnosis
was
made
and
it
happened
a
good
bit
of
time
afterward?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
mundell,
are
you
arguing
that
there
isn't
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
here
to
justify
the
jury's
findings
against
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
give
you
another
example
to
follow
through
on
justice
stewart's
question.
suppose
in
the
middle
of
a
long
voyage,
a
patient
has
a
diabetic
flare-up.
i
think
this
can't
be
cured
but
is
it
your
position
that
the
shipowner
is
not
obligated
to
afford
him
such
palliative
treatment
as
is
available
by
insulin?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
most
ships
apply
in
the
great
lakes,
have
doctors
aboard
them
or
is
it
always
a
question
of
wait
until
you
get
to
the
public
health
service
hospital
at
the
end
of
the
voyage?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
in
this
case,
the
injury
having
occurred
in
early
april
and
the
plaintiff
having
been
discharged
from
the
service
the
end
of
june,
there
presumably
would
have
been
a
series
of
voyages?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
just
back
and
forth?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
jaques,
the
jury
as
i
understand
that
gave
him
maintenance
and
cure
exactly
two
years,
june
29,
1968
the
date
of
discharge
to
the
same
date
1970.
did
they
just
pick
this
out
of
the
air
as
kind
of
a
compromise,
what
do
you
think
it
is?
what
is
the
significance
of
that
1970
date?
