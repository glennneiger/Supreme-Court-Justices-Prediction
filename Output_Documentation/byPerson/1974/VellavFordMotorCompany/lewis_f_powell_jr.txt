justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
following
up
the
questions
that
were
asked
you
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
understood
you
to
say
that
maintenance
and
cure
did
not
last
for
life
under
any
circumstances.
the
test
being
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time,
i
have
not
read
the
cases
that
might
shed
any
light
as
to
what
benchmarks
are
examined
to
determine
what
is
a
reasonable
time.
do
cases
shed
light
on
that?
take
the
case
mr.
justice
stewart
put
to
you
of
a
young
man
who
lost
both
legs,
or
the
man
who
had
emphysema
for
example
that
would
be
with
him
for
life.
how
does
the
court
determine
what
is
a
reasonable
time?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
the
rule.
