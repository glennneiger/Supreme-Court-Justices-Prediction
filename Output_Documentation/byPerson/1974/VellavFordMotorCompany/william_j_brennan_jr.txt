justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
asking
for
a
remand
to
the
trial
court
to
the
entry
of
an
amended
order
of
judgment,
which
is
to
say
you
are
not
satisfied
with
the
verdict
you
got
from
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
ask
us
to
do
that?
you
didn't
appeal
jury
verdict
yourself
to
the
court
of
appeals,
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
can
you
ask
us
to
do
it
if
you
didn't
appeal
this
to
the
court
of
appeals
yourself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
it.
what
you
got
from
the
jury
was
for
two
years.
was
it
from
june
29,
1968?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
are
asking
for
almost
four
years
from
june
29,
1968
to
april
27,
1972,
is
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
see
our
difficulties
or
at
least
my
difficulties,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
ask
us
to
do
that
when
you
didn't
appeal,
a
cross
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
about
the
issue
of
the
attorney's
fees?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but,
again
were
they
denied
by
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
again
you
didn't
appeal
that,
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
--
how
is
that
different
from
this
case?
dr.
heil,
as
i
understood
what
you
said
earlier,
mr.
mundell,
is
the
only
one
to
ever
trust
the
question
of
whether
it
was
curable
or
not.
and
he
didn't
until
march
27,
1972.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
question
is
whether
a
shipowner's
duty
to
furnish
maintenance
and
cure
to
a
seaman
who
suffers
an
incurable
injury
aboard
ship
continues
from
the
date
the
seaman
leaves
the
ship
to
the
date
when
a
medical
diagnosis
is
made
that
his
injury
was
in
fact
incurable
when
he
left
the
ship.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
the
shipowner's
duty
did
not
continue
after
but
terminated
when
the
seaman
left
the
ship.
we
unanimously
reverse.
