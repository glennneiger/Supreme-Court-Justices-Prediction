chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
are
you're
reading
from
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
frey.
mr.
lauer.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
perhaps
overstate
or
go
beyond
what
you
need
to
go
beyond
when
you
say
that
you
could
not
demonstrate
these
things
by
affidavit
in
a
pretrial
motion.
wouldn't
it
be
more
accurate
to
say
that
a
judge
is
likely
find
the
demonstration
much
more
graphic
on
the
cases
he
tried
and
that
you
would
find
them
from
some
affidavits?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
this
is
a
parallel
to
some
extent
of
the
case
where
a
judge
is
in
doubt
as
he
is
going
along
but
decides
to
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury,
get
their
verdict
and
then
with
more
time
to
reflect
on
the
interaction
of
all
the
evidence
that
decide
the
standard
of
judgment
n.o.v.
is
it
something
like
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
you
characterize
the
cerebrations
of
the
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
applying
the
law
of
speedy
trial
to
the
facts
of
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
face
of
the
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
same
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
case,
he
would
be
applying
what
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
applying
that
standard
to
the
facts
that
he
has
heard
up
to
the
time
of
the
closing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
saying
to
himself,
this
is
not
enough
to
persuade
any
reasonable
person
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
that's
about
the
same
kind
of
a
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
lauer.
you
have
a
few
minutes
left
mr.
frey?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
united
states
against
wilson
and
bryan.
mr.
norton,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
they
then
incarcerated
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
then
just
a
confinement
in
a
different
place.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
difference
in
harris
was
that
you
don't
have
12
jurors
and
witnesses
and
the
whole
mechanism
of
a
court
standing
by
waiting.
as
you
point
out,
a
grand
jury
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
a
grand
jury
could
take
the
matter
up
to
30
days
or
60
days
later.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
a
petite
jury
would
be
difficult
to
hold
--
petite
jury
trial
would
be
difficult
to
hold
in
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.
ginsberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
on
the
question
of
it's
being
respectful
or
disrespectful
or
otherwise,
what
difference
does
that
make
in
terms
of
holding
up
a
trial
of
a
jury
case
where
you
have
12
or
possibly
14
jurors
with
alternates
standing
by
and
witnesses
standing
by,
approaching
the
end?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
do
you
distinguish
the
two?
do
you
think
the
two
are
not
linked
together?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
liability
are
you
referring
to,
i'm
not
quite
clear?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
how
would
that
injure
him?
he
could
only
impeach
him
with
convictions
that
were
a
record
as
a
matter
of
public
record,
isn't
that
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
these
all
matters
that
the
court
could
take
into
account
at
a
subsequent
point?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren't
you
aware
that
a
vast
majority
of
contempt
citations,
penalties
are
reduced
after
their
original
imposition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
could
understand
your
position
about
his
possible
mental
condition
if
he
had
engaged
in
disruptive
conduct
as
in
the
case
that
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to.
here,
he
was
casting
his
refusal
on
strictly
legal
grounds,
was
he
not
and
there
was
no
disruption
of
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
misconduct
of
any
kind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
except
the
refusal
in
itself.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
be
sure
you're
going
to
get
a
neutral
judgment
in
the
sentencing
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
isn't
that
your
--
the
theory
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
he
was
punishing
him
for
his
contumacious
refusal
to
answer,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
part
of
it
the
deterrence
of
that
kind
of
conduct
with
respect
to
other
witnesses
in
other
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there,
your
taking
issue
with
rule
42
(a),
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
one
of
the
consequences
of
this
conduct
was
quite
serious,
was
it
not,
in
terms
of
the
results
of
one
of
the
trials?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
more
likely,
the
alternative
is
that
we
would
have
had
your
case
submitted
on
briefs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
judge
was
well-aware,
was
he
not?
the
trial
was
virtually
coming
to
a
close
very
shortly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
submission
requires
you,
i
take
it,
to
either
say
that
42
(a)
is
constitutionally
flawed
or
else
this
is
not
a
42
(a)
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
go
back
to
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
go
back
to
the
consequences
on
the
other
trial.
they
were
rather
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
speaking
also
of
the
suggestion
of
the
solicitor
general
that
there
was
a
serious
miscarriage
of
justice
by
the
directed
acquittal.
it
was
directed
really
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
sentence
imposed
on
the
one
defendant
who
was
found
guilty
in
the
--
was
it
a
new
trial,
separate?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
the
bank
robbery
so
it
can
be
assumed
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
can
be
assumed
that
it's
a
very
substantial
sentence.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
conduct
that
leads
to
the
acquittal
of
a
man
guilty,
apparently,
of
a
10-year
offense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
alternative
argument
was
that
it
should
--
they
should
give
him,
or
perhaps
it
was
your
colleague's
argument,
give
him
time
to
think
it
over
until
the
next
day
and
he
might
change
his
mind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
does
that
mean
that
every
time
a
court
is
confronted
with
a
recalcitrant
witness
you
stop
all
the
proceedings
and
give
him
24
hours
to
think
it
over
and
see
if
he's
going
to
answer
questions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
you
have
about
five
minutes
left
if
you
have
anything
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
mr.
martin,
you
appeared
by
appointment
of
the
court
and
on
behalf
of
the
court,
i
want
to
thank
you
for
your
assistance
to
us
and
of
course,
your
assistance
to
your
client.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
73-1395
united
states
against
wilson
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
judgment
and
opinion
to
announce
in
73-1162,
united
states
against
wilson
and
bryan.
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
blackmun

whom

a
concurring
opinion.
mr.

a
dissenting
opinion.
