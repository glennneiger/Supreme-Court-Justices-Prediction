justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
mr.
frey
could
that
be
done
by
simply
reinstating
the
guilty
verdict
and
entering
judgment
on
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
this
would
be
like
jenkins,
except
for
the
different
trier
of
fact.
if
in
jenkins,
judge
travia
had
first
found
the
defendant
guilty
and
then
separately
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
enters
as
a
judgment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
he
can
entertain
a
motion
for
a
new
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
palko
in
effect
said
you
could
have
a
rational
system
of
jurisprudence
without
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
presumably,
even
if
palko
were
still
a
law,
we
would
be
dealing
in
the
federal
system
as
we
are
here
now
with
the
core
notion,
but
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
of
course,
the
acquittal
came
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
russell,
not
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
this
is
the
type
of
thing
that
many
inexperienced
trial
judge
wouldn't
take
your
word
by
affidavit
for
at
a
pretrial
stage,
but
sitting
through
the
evidence
may
have
reached
a
different
conclusion
on
his
own?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
approve.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
argument
though
a
acquittal
must
have
significance
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
it's
no
longer
has
a
statutory
significance?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
you
do
get
over
it,
you
have
it
right
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
would
be
your
position
mr.
lauer
if
the
jury
returns
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
the
judge
grants
a
post
trial
motion
for
acquittal
call
it
dismissing
the
indictment
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
of
limitations
as
well.
is
that
appealable
by
the
government
under
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
ordinarily
something
that
you
charge
the
jury
about,
the
statute
of
limitations?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
there
were
no
question
in
fact,
there
was
simply
a
question
of
which
statute
of
limitations
applied
and
jury
verdict
of
guilt
in
a
post
trial
motion
granted?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
waive
it
by
making
a
post
trial
motion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there,
there
would
have
been
a
second
trial
necessary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
norton,
don't
you
think
the
court
that
decided
harris
would
probably
decide
this
case
against
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
ginsberg,
did
this
contempt
require
mens
rea?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
authority
for
that
proposition?
