ms.
sheila
ginsberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
without
valid
justification
therefore,
the
government
asks
this
court
to
approve
a
criminal
conviction
in
six
months
sentence
without
--
imposed
without
an
opportunity
to
defend
against
that
imposition.
there
are
a
few
facts
surrounding
the
contempt
in
this
case
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize.
first,
that
the
contempt
or
--
forgive
me,
the
refusal
to
testify
at
all
times
was
orderly
and
respectful.
the
witness
was
called
to
testify
before
the
same
judge,
this
is
respondent
wilson,
was
called
to
testify
before
the
same
judge
who
was
to
eventually
sentence
him
on
the
underlying
bank
robbery
charge.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
distinction
is
that
the
purpose
of
summary
power
is
not
just
to
move
the
trial
along,
but
to
preserve
the
authority
and
the
dignity
of
the
court.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
there
may
be
some
link
but,
i
might
add,
that
that
precipitous
summary
action
may
well
do
more
to
infringe
upon
the
authority
and
dignity
of
the
court
than
the
short
adjournment
of
perhaps
24
hours
so
that
a
hearing
can
be
held
to
allow
the
accused,
condemned,
or
an
opportunity
to
defend.
i
mean,
in
answer
to
what
i
perceive
to
be
your
honor's
concerns
during
the
assistance
argument,
trials
are
frequently
adjourned
for
short
periods
of
time
without
the
calamity
befalling
the
system
that
the
government
now
suggests.
adjournments
are
granted
in
criminal
trials
for
much
less
consequential
reasons
the
point
is
that,
in
fact,
adjudications
of
criminal
contempt
are
not
exempt
from
procedural
due
process
and
in
this
case,
there
was
no
reason,
no
valid
reason
for
not
affording
respondent
wilson
the
opportunity
to
defend
against
the
charge.
now,
when
the
respondent
refused
to
testify,
he
did
so
on
the
grounds
that
even
the
grant
of
immunity
would
not
protect
him
from
use
of
his
testimony
against
him
at
the
time
of
sentence.
i
would
like
to
point
out
at
this
juncture
that
there
were
other
dama
--
there
were
other
--
there
was
other
liability
within
the
context
of
his
testimony
because
had
he
testified,
he
would've
been
subject
to
cross-examination
by
defense
counsel
and
it
wasn't
--
he
was
just
not
subject
to
liability
as
to
the
facts
of
this
crime
but
there
were
other
areas
perhaps,
and
i
don't
suggest
that
they
definitely
exist
here
but
there's
a
possibility
that
he
would
be
subjected
to
greater
liability
by
the
cross-examination
of
defense
counsel.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
on
cross-examination,
for
example,
if
defense
counsel
were
to
ask
mr.
wilson
to
impeach
his
credibility
about
the
commission
of
other
crimes.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
that
is
so,
but
whether
or
not
they
were
known
to
the
probation
department
is
--
without
mr.
wilson's
testimony
is
another
--
now,
the
question
that
i
have
to
hasten
to
add
that
i
don't
suggest
that
there
were
those
other
crimes
committed
here,
but
there
is
that
possibility.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
yes,
your
honor.
i
feel
there
was,
and
the
second
circuit
specifically
held
that
there
was.
counsel
not
only
objected
to,
or
requested
rather,
a
continuance
to
enable
time
to
research
the
legal
issue.
she
specifically,
and
i
believe
it's
at
page
5
of
the
appendix,
specifically
objected
to
the
hasty
determination
of
this
issue
which
subjected
respondent
wilson
to
heavy
criminal
penalties.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
your
honor,
i
argue
of
course
that
that
--
there
is
a
due
process
right
to
a
hearing
and
i
would
also
rely
on
the
supervisory
powers
of
the
court
to
preclude
from
the
ambit
of
rule
42
(a),
an
orderly
respectful
refusal
to
testify.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
as
i
said,
i've
--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well
--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
yes,
that's
all
that
i
need.
yes,
sir.[attempt
to
laughter]
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
no,
that's
true.
that
is
true.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
in
any
case,
judge
lasker,
recognizing
the
viability
of
the
respondent's
claims,
attempted
to
sentence
him
before
requiring
his
testimony.
however,
after
hearing
the
probation
officer
and
defense
counsel,
the
judge
concluded
that
he
did
not
have
sufficient
information,
information
particularly
of
a
psychiatric
nature,
to
adequately
sentence
the
respondent
on
the
bank
robbery.
he
then
determined
that
respondent's
fifth
amendment
rights
did
not
extend
to
protect
him
from
use
of
his
testimony
on
--
at
the
time
of
sentence
for
the
bank
robbery
and
he
ordered
respondents
to
testify.
when
he
refused,
he
immediately
held
them
in
contempt
and
sentenced
him
to
six
months
in
prison.
we
contend
clearly
that
this
was
error.
the
adjudication
of
criminal
contempt
is
not
exempt
from
due
process
considerations
of
notice
and
a
hearing.
in
harris,
this
court
specifically
held
that
rule
42
(b)
and
the
notice
and
hearing
provision
therein
provided
the
general
or
the
normal
procedure
for
dealing
with
contempts
in
the
federal
regime.
harris
went
on
to
say
that
this
would
give
the
accused
condemner
an
opportunity
to
present
the
legal
defenses
to
the
charge
of
contempt
and,
also,
to
present
facts
in
mitigation
of
the
charge
or
the
penalty.
now,
in
this
case,
had
counsel
been
given
that
opportunity,
there
was
much
that
she
could've
done
by
way
of
defense
for
wilson.
in
the
first
instance,
as
i
just
noted,
there
was
some
indication
in
the
record
of
psychiatric
problems.
now,
the
government
tries
to
dismiss
this
as
of
little
consequence,
but
the
fact
remains
that
judge
lasker
was
convinced
that
there
was
some
need
for
psychiatric
treatment
and
he
specifically
indicated
his
intent
to
incorporate
that
psychiatric
treatment
within
the
sentence
for
the
bank
robbery.
clearly,
psychiatric
problems
are
relevant
to
determining
wilson's
responsibility
for
refusing
to
testify
and
if
not
that
far,
they
certainly
arose
until
mitigation
of
the
sentence.
moreover,
there
was
a
new
--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
i
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
i
believe
there
is
a
per
curium
on
decision
of
this
court.
the
name
of
the
case
however,
escapes
me.
i
can
submit
it
at
a
later
date.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
they
are.
i
don't
think
that
a
--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
that
may
well
be,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that,
as
a
general
principle
of
law
and
as
it
applies
in
this
case,
a
rule
35
motion
is
insufficient
to
compensate
for
the
deficiencies
of
this
procedure.
firstly,
a
rule
35
motion
does
not
go
to
the
imposition
of
the
criminal
conviction
and
secondly,
i
think
that
what
that
procedure
countenance
is,
is
the
imposition
of
a
final
sentence
based
on
inadequate
information.
it
places
the
respondent
in
a
position
of
coming
into
court
and
convincing
the
judge
that
his
initial
decision
was
incorrect.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
oh!
there
clearly
was
no
disruption
of
the
courtroom,
but
the
--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
none.
no
misbehavior.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
but,
clearly,
there
are
levels
of
or
brands
of
incompetence
which
go
the
witness'
inability
to
comprehend
the
obligation
to
testify.
it
would
seem
--
and,
in
fact,
the
per
curium
that
i
was
thinking
of,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
deals
with
a
refusal
to
testify
or
a
testimony
before
a
grand
jury
at
any
case.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
are
certain
varieties
of
incompetence
that
would
certainly
go
to
that.
there
were
other
facts
here
which
clearly
counsel
could've
presented
at
a
hearing
had
she
been
given
the
opportunity.
first
of
all,
there
was
a
confusion
as
to
the
extent
of
wilson's
fifth
amendment
privilege,
how
far
it
would
protect
him.
judge
lasker
and
the
prosecutor
were
both
labeling
under
--
laboring
under
the
misconception
that
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
did
not
extend
to
the
sentence.
judge
lasker
believed
that
there
was
no
way
to
protect
wilson
from
the
sentencing
--
from
having
a
sentencing
judge
use
his
testimony
and,
in
fact,
he
didn't
have
the
right
to
protect
the
sentencing
judge
from
doing
that.
the
second
circuit,
in
fact,
in
its
opinion
set
forth
the
procedure
whereby
wilson
could've
been
protected
and
had
counsel
been
given
the
opportunity
she
requested
of
a
continuance,
it's
entirely
possible
that
she
would've
come
up
with
this
procedure
and
thereby
obviated
the
whole
need
for
the
hearing.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
i
believe
it
was
worked
out
in
the
second
circuit,
but
not
just
on
this
appeal.
they
rely,
in
their
opinion,
on
united
states
against
goldberg
which
was
the
case
the
prosecutor
handed
up
to
the
judge
during
this
hearing,
but
everything
was
done
with
such
haste
and
with
all
due
respect
to
judge
lasker,
in
such
a
cursory
fashion
that
it
was
never
thought
--
the
procedure
was
never
thought
through
and
nobody
ever
realized
or
at
least
articulated
at
the
hearing
that
that
wilson
could
be
protected
by
testifying,
having
the
record
sealed
and
then
having
his
sentence
transferred
to
another
judge.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
no,
your
honor.
it's
a
fifth
amendment
protection.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
no.
it's
to
ensure
protection
or
to
ensure
that
the
sentencing
judge
does
not
use
a
substance
of
the
testimony
to
increase
the
underlying
sentence
in
this
case
for
the
bank
robbery.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
exactly.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
exactly
so.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
yes.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
exactly.
i
would
like
to
quickly
get
to
the
government's
justification
for
the
summary
proceedings.
they
claim
that,
despite
--
well,
despite
the
language
of
harris
which
makes
it
very
clear
that
summary
proceedings
under
rule
42
(a)
are
only
to
be
used
in
exceptional
circumstances
and
harris
defined
those
exceptional
circumstances
as
acts
of
--
in
court
acts
of
misbehavior
which
threatened
the
judge
or
obstruct
the
proceeding
or
the
courtroom,
disrupt
the
courtroom.
the
government
argues
that
the
justification
in
this
case
was
to
compel
testimony.
now,
first
of
all,
i
must
point
out
that
due
the
record
is
so
--
if
it
is
clear
about
anything,
it
is
clear
about
the
fact
that
judge
lasker
did
not
intend
to
coerce
mr.
wilson's
testimony
by
sentencing
him
for
criminal
contempt.
the
judge
--
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
that's
correct,
but
it
was
not
intended
to
coerce
the
testimony,
this
punishment.
the
judge
stayed
the
sentence
pending
appeal
and
he
told,
specifically
told
mr.
wilson
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
concern
himself
about
the
sentence
at
this
time.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
well,
if
in
fact
that
is
one
of
the
purposes,
it
doesn't
seem
as
though
that
purpose
would
be
thwarted
by
notice
of
24
hours
and
a
short
hearing.
i'd
also
like
to
say
that
the
use
of
criminal
contempt
to
coerce
testimony
is
violative
of
the
whole
concept
of
criminal
contempt.
criminal
contempt,
as
your
honor
points
out,
is
to
punish
not
to
coerce.
it's
a
civil
contempt
sanction.
ms.
sheila
ginsberg
no,
sir.
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
just
saying
that
criminal
contempt
should
not
--
was
not
intended
as
--
to
have
as
its
primary
purpose
coercion,
but
punishment.
