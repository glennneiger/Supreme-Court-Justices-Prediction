but
all
these
facts
really
went
to
prejudice?
justice

i
mean
what
finally
determined
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
can
deny
a
speedy
trial,
but
finally
the
time
when
the
judge
denied
a
speedy
trial,
was
that
not
having
this
evidence
available,
his
trial
was
prejudiced?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
the
connection
with
the
fact
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
a
speedy
trial
issue
requires
a
determination
of
prejudice
anyway?
