justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
the
government
suggesting
in
any
respect
that
we
cut
back
on
sisson?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
oh,
i
don't
(voice
overlap
)
let
me
ask
another
question.
suppose
there
is
a
guilty
verdict
and
it's
overturned
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
--
by
the
court,
the
district
court,
on
the
basis
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
is
that
a
determination
of
fact
or
of
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
what
you
said
there
mr.
frey,
you
believe
that
sisson
is
what?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
norton,
was
there
any
formal
objection
to
use
of
a
summary
procedure?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
ginsberg,
i
asked
government
counsel
as
to
whether
there
was
an
objection
made
to
the
summary
procedure
here,
was
there
--
do
you
feel
there
was
sufficient
objection
made?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
you
another
question,
now
that
i
have
you
interrupted.
are
you
here
--
are
you
bottoming
your
position
in
the
case
on
due
process
on
a
constitutional
ground
or
on
the
supervisory
power
of
this
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
this
is
a
federal
case
--
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
and
the
next
one
might
be
a
state
case
and
our
supervisory
power
might
not
exist
in
a
state
case.
so,
hence,
i
was
wondering
whether
you
were
reaching
for
constitutional
grounds.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
it
isn't
at
all
what
the
next
case
needs
coming
up
from
a
state's
side?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
just
looking
ahead
to
our
further
agony.[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
much
notice
would've
been
sufficient
do
you
think
in
this
case,
24
hours?
