justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
according
to
the
appendix?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
the
implication
however
of
the
judges
action
that
had
there
not
been
this
delay
the
jury
verdict
might
well
have
been
different,
it
would
have
been
not
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
the
finding
of
substantial
prejudice
is
simply
a
way
of
saying
that,
had
the
trial
been
conducted
more
properly,
the
result
may
well
have
been
different.
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
to
be
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
it
would
have
been
different,
it
would
have
been
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
rather
than
a
verdict
of
guilty.
so
to
that
extent,
it
does
have
something
to
do
with
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
doesn't
know
what
these
witnesses
would
have
testified.
how
could
he
make
any
such
finding?
for
one
was
dead
and
the
other
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
there
is
a
possibility
that
he
couldn't
testify,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
prosecution
hadn't
even
finished
its
case?
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
that
decided
brown,
a
fortiori
would
decide
this
case
in
your
favor?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
a
per
curium
involving
a
contempt
in
a
federal
court
and
maybe
the
case
you're
thinking
about,
long
polysyllabic
name,
in
which
the
--
there
was
a
lot
of
very
gross
conspicuous
misconduct
by
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
case.
then
it
was
suggested
that
he
may
--
might
have
been
insane,
might
not
have
been
competent
and
this
court
remanded
to
canvas
that
issue
which
would
suggest
that
it
does
--
that
the
contempt
does
require
mens
rea
because
for
only
the
objective
conduct,
then
i
suppose
an
insane
person
could've
been
equally
guilty
of
contempt
but
if
it
requires
a
--
but
if
only
a
competent
person
could
be
found
in
contempt
which
was
the
implicit
holding
in
that
case,
then
i
would
suppose
it
would
--
the
answer
would
be
it
requires
mens
rea.
justice
potter
stewart
could
that
procedure
--
is
that
a
statutory
procedure
or
one
worked
out
on
the
second
circuit?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
protection
is
not
against
self-incrimination,
but
against
reprisals
in
the
penitentiary
and
so
on,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
protection
procedure
that's
been
worked
out?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
sealed
testimony
also
serves
the
same
function,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
sealing
of
the
testimony?
justice
potter
stewart
the
difficulty
is
mr.
martin
for
me
at
least,
one
difficulty,
that
we're
dealing
here
really
with
the
specific
language
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
are
we
not,
unless,
you're
suggesting
that
there's
something
constitutionally
deficient
about
the
language
of
42
(a)?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
does
this
mean
that
you
do
concede
that
the
language
of
42
(a)
would
permit
summary
contempt
power
in
these
circumstances
of
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
your
point
is
that
the
constitutional
privilege
against
compulsory
self-incrimination
has
got
subtleties
and
nuisances
that
a
person
can't
decide
upon
by
himself
but
needs
a
lawyer
to
help
him
decide,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
where
were
you
reading
from
and
what
is
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
of
the
appendix.
justice
potter
stewart
beginning,
“my
suggestion
is
that
i
impose
a
sentence…”?
