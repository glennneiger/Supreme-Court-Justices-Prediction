mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit,
dismissing
the
government's
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
which
after
a
jury
verdict
of
guilty,
dismissed
respondent's
indictment
because
of
allegedly
prejudicial
pre-indictment
delay.
respondent
was
the
financial
secretary
and
the
business
manager
of
a
union
local
in
pennsylvania.
the
indictment
charged
that
he
had
converted
approximately
$1,200
in
funds
belonging
to
the
union,
for
the
purpose
of
paying
the
cost
of
his
daughter's
wedding
reception
in
1966.
this
payment
was
made
by
a
check
issued
by
two
officers
of
the
union,
brinker
and
schaefer.
brinker
died
in
1968
before
the
investigation
of
respondent's
activities
by
the
fbi
was
very
far
along.
by
the
time
the
indictment
was
returned
in
this
case,
in
1971,
schaefer
was
terminally
ill
and
he
was
unavailable
to
testify
at
respondent's
trial.
on
the
basis
of
the
unavailability
of
mr.
schaefer
and
brinker,
respondent
twice
moved
before
trial
for
dismissal
of
the
charges
against
him.
hearings
were
held
on
both
these
motions
and
the
evidence
on
behalf
of
the
government
at
these
hearings
showed
that
schaefer
and
brinker
had
no
active
role
in
the
union's
business
affairs,
that
their
signatures
on
the
union
checks
were
a
routine
perfunctory
matter.
respondent
on
the
other
hand
testified
that
he
had
never
directed
anyone
to
prepare
the
check
or
to
use
union
funds
to
pay
for
his
daughter's
wedding.
after
each
hearing,
the
district
court
denied
respondent's
motion
to
dismiss.
at
trial,
respondent
moved
for
a
judgment
of
acquittal,
which
was
denied
and
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury
which
returned
a
guilty
verdict.
respondent
then
renewed
his
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal,
it
was
again
denied.
thereafter,
respondent
filed
further
post
trial
motions
again
asking
for
acquittal
and
also
for
arrest
of
judgment
on
new
trial.
each
motion
was
based
in
part
on
his
contention
regarding
the
pre-indictment
delay.
three
weeks
after
the
filing
of
these
motions,
the
district
court
entered
an
order
dismissing
the
indictment
on
the
grounds
of
prejudicial
pre-indictment
delay.
it
did
so
without
eluding
to
its
previous
actions
denying
the
same
motions
prior
to
trial,
but
stating
that
it
had
taken
notice
of
facts
brought
out
in
the
testimony
of
the
case
concerning
the
potential
testimony
of
mr.
schaefer.
since
we
believe
that
the
district
court
had
erred
in
its
legal
conclusion,
that
there
was
an
unreasonable
delay
depriving
respondent
of
his
opportunity
for
a
fair
trial,
and
that
this
was
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
an
appeal
to
the
third
circuit
was
authorized.
the
court
of
appeals
initially
entered
an
order
dismissing
the
appeal
in
citing
sisson
and
claiming
that
the
appeal
was
not
permissible
under
the
statute.
consequently,
we
filed
a
petition
for
re-hearing
and
also
in
the
event
there
was
some
statutory
problem
in
their
view,
a
petition
for
mandamus
in
the
alternative
relying
on
the
dooling
case
in
the
second
circuit.
re-hearing
was
denied
and
this
time
the
court
of
appeals
issued
an
opinion.
it
agreed
that
there
was
no
statutory
impediment
to
appeal,
leaving
aside
of
course,
the
statutes
in
corporation
of
any
constitutional
restrictions.
they
concluded
that
the
appeal
was
constitutionally
barred
because
the
action
of
the
trial
court
was
an
acquittal
and
because
acquittals
could
not
in
its
view
be
appealed
consistently
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
in
concluding
that
the
action
of
the
district
court
was
an
acquittal,
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
the
definition
of
the
term
in
sission,
where
by
the
way,
it
was
being
defined
for
the
purpose
of
determining
a
question
of
appealability
under
former
section
3731.
that
definition
is,
“the
trial
judge's
disposition
is
an
acquittal,
if
it
is
a
legal
determination
on
the
basis
of
facts
adduced
at
trial
relating
to
the
general
issue
of
the
case.
the
court
of
appeal
said
that
the
determination
made
by
the
district
court
here
was
based
on
the
facts
adduced
at
trial
which
we
don't
dispute
and
that
these
facts
related
to
the
general
issue
of
the
case.
and
that
therefore,
since
it
was
based
on
facts
adduced
at
trial
which
related
to
the
general
issue
of
the
case,
it
was
an
acquittal,
even
though
the
determination
itself
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
general
issue
of
the
case.
now,
the
case
poses
two
questions,
one
which
we
began
discussing
this
morning
in
the
jenkins
case,
that
is
assuming
that
this
is
characterized
as
an
acquittal
properly
by
the
court
of
appeals,
does
that
bar
our
recourse
to
appellate
review,
and
secondly
the
question
of
whether
--
if
that
is
the
case,
was
it
properly
so
characterized.
now,
i'd
like
to
deal
further
with
the
first
issue
if
i
may,
which
we
were
discussing
this
morning.
i
think
the
court
has
to
look
at
this
question
which
as
i've
indicated
is
a
matter
of
first
impression
here.
and
it
has
to
consider
of
what
it
is
that
the
government
is
asking
to
have
done,
and
what
the
interests
are
of
the
system
of
public
justice
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
legitimate
interest
of
the
defendant
that
the
constitution
recognizes
and
seeks
to
protect
on
the
other
hand.
now,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
articulable
value,
there
is
no
rational
constitutional
policy,
that
is
dis-served
by
allowing
government
appeals
in
circumstances
such
as
those
presented
by
this
case.
if
the
government
appeal
fails,
that
is
if
we're
wrong
on
the
merits
and
the
district
court
was
right,
then
the
judgment
is
affirmed
and
the
defendant
is
finally
discharged
and
the
matter
is
concluded.
on
the
other
hand
if
it
succeeds,
the
trial
court
is
simply
required
to
attach
to
the
trial
that
has
already
taken
place,
the
correct
legal
consequences.
now
--
but
none
of
the
values
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
designed
to
serve
are
impaired
by
our
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
yes,
you
would
the
direct
district
court
presumably
if
it
was
wrong
in
its
ruling
to
enter
a
judgment
on
the
verdict.
now
of
course
there
maybe
--
again
there
maybe
other
post
trial
motions
which
the
district
court
would
wish
to
consider
before
entering
a
final
judgment
such
as
a
motion
for
a
new
trial
which
he
never
reached
because
of
the
grounds
on
which
he
concluded
the
case.
but
it's
perfectly
clear
it
seems
to
me
that
the
jury
has
found
the
facts,
and
has
found
them
favorably
to
the
government
and
in
this
sense
the
situation
is
not
as
different.
we
are
not
contending
that
we're
in
a
materially
stronger
position
in
this
case
than
we
would
be
in
the
jenkins
case,
although
one
could
possibly
seek
to
make
a
distinction
between
jury
and
non-jury
trials.
in
the
jenkins
case,
the
judge
acted
in
two
functions.
he
performed
the
jury's
function
as
a
finder
of
fact
and
he
performed
his
judicial
function
and
it's
there
that
he
went
wrong
and
it
was
his
error
in
performing
the
judicial
function
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
this
case,
he
never
entered
a
judgment
of
conviction.
he
dismissed
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
presumably,
it's
not
clear
what
he
acted
on.
i
don't
think
that
there
was
a
motion
for
dismissal
of
the
indictment
as
such,
but
that
is
the
relief
that
he
granted.
of
course,
under
rule
12
he
was
required
to
consider
an
act
on
that
prior
to
trial
and
he
did
consider
an
act
on
it
prior
to
trial
and
denied
it
and
there's
some
question
about
his
power
subsequent
to
trial
to
reopen
that
matter
or
whether
if
he's
once
denied
at
prior
to
trial
only
the
appellate
court
can
argue
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
prior
to
trial
certainly,
on
this
very
ground
that
he
acted
on
subsequently.
now,
we
think
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
difficult
to
say
what
that
means.
we
say
that
in
effect
of
course
he
found
the
defendant
guilty,
had
he
applied
the
correct
law
to
what
was
done,
but
i
suppose
it
would
be
true
that
--
i
don't
think
that
a
judge
in
a
non-jury
trial
enters
a
verdict
however
which
would
be
the
--
for
a
situation
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
enters
a
judgment.
of
course,
once
he's
entered
a
judgment
then
his
power
to
act
with
respect
to
that
judgment
is
limited.
further
it
then
becomes
subject
to
appellate
review.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
yes,
there
are
certain
forms
of
relief
that
he
can
grant.
in
the
green
case,
mr.
justice
black
discussed
some
of
the
policies
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
the
interests
that
are
served
that
we
say
are
not
adversely
affected
by
government
appeal
here.
he
began
at
page
187
of
355
u.s.
by
saying,
“the
constitutional
prohibition
against
double
jeopardy
was
designed
to
protect
an
individual
from
being
subjected
to
the
hazards
of
trial
and
possible
conviction
more
than
once
for
an
alleged
offense.�?
then
after
quoting
from
blackstone
and
from
ex
parte
lange,
he
said
the
underlying
idea,
one
that
is
deeply
ingrained
in
at
least
the
anglo-american
system
of
jurisprudence
is
that
the
state
with
all
its
resources
and
power
should
not
be
allowed
to
make
repeated
attempts
to
convict
an
individual
for
an
alleged
offense,
thereby
subjecting
him
to
embarrassment,
expense
and
ordeal,
and
compelling
him
to
live
in
a
continuing
state
of
anxiety,
and
insecurity
as
well
as
enhancing
the
possibility
that
even
though
innocent
he
maybe
found
guilty.
now,
we
submit
that
these
interests
are
not
at
stake
in
the
government's
appeal
in
this
case.
now,
what
justice
black
was
clearly
talking
about
was
the
situation
in
the
ball
case
and
in
cases
of
that
sort.
now
also
i
had
note
that
even
in
the
context
of
a
second
trial,
following
a
legally
erroneous
acquittal,
mr.
justice
cardozo
observed
in
palko
against
connecticut
and
here
i
refer
to
palko
because
of
its
relevance
to
the
constitutional
policies
that
are
at
stake
here.
the
state
is
not
attempting
to
wear
the
accused
out
by
a
multitude
of
cases
with
accumulated
trials.
it
asked
no
more
than
this
that
the
case
against
him
shall
go
on
until
there
shall
be
a
trial
free
from
the
corrosion
of
substantial
legal
error.
this
is
not
cruelty
at
all
nor
even
vexation
in
any
immoderate
degree.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
said
that
the
core
value
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
that
would
be
transmitted
to
the
states
under
the
notion
of
palko
through
the
due
process
clause
would
be
basically
the
ball
notion
that
a
man
who
has
been
tried
and
acquitted
on
the
facts,
can't
be
subjected
to
a
second
prosecution.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
understand
that
and
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
in
alluding
to
palko
that
he
meant
to
exclude
the
possibility
of
other
considerations
because
one
of
the
things
that
happened
in
the
palko
opinion,
was
that
he
discussed
kepner.
and
in
discussing
kepner,
he
--
the
court
refrained
from
overruling
kepner,
but
it
did
clearly
indicate
in
its
discussion
that
it
had
a
great
deal
of
sympathy
for
justice
holmes'
views
in
kepner.
now,
the
court
could
have
decided
palko
by
overruling
kepner.
it
instead
took
the
course
of
saying
that
that
to
the
extent
kepner
imposes
more
than
this
core
notion,
adds
more
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
this
core
notion,
that
added
ingredient
is
not
applicable
to
the
states
through
the
due
process
clause.
and
of
course,
in
benton
against
maryland
in
which
palko
was
overruled,
as
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
dissent,
what
maryland
had
tried
to
do
came
within
this
core
notion
and
the
case
could
have
been
decided
on
due
process
grounds,
what
maryland
did
was
indefensible
even
on
those
grounds.
now,
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
if
enshrined
as
a
constitutional
holding
by
this
court,
will
create
serious
illogicality
and
will
be
wholly
inconsistent
with
recognized
law
and
other
related
instances.
i
think
the
clearest
instance
that
comes
to
mind
is
the
instance
of
supreme
court
review
of
acquittals
by
courts
of
appeals.
let's
take
for
instance
the
russell
case
which
this
court
decided
two
terms
ago.
defendant
was
convicted
and
he
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
examined
the
evidence
that
was
adduced
at
trial
relating
to
the
general
issue
and
it
found
on
the
basis
of
that
evidence
that
a
government
agent
had
supplied
the
necessary
ingredient
for
the
manufacturer
of
the
controlled
substance.
it
held
applying
an
erroneous
legal
standard
that
on
those
facts,
there
was
entrapment
and
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
an
acquittal.
now,
if
an
acquittal
is
not
appealable,
then
i
do
not
understand
by
what
means
we
were
able
to
take
the
russell
case
to
the
supreme
court
and
get
a
reversal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
true
but
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
was
performing
the
identical
function
in
russell
that
the
district
judge
was
performing
here
in
the
wilson
case,
that
is
ruling
on
a
question
of
law.
it
was
to
the
jury
who
was
committed
the
responsibility
of
finding
the
facts.
what
the
judge
did
here
was
indistinguishable
in
terms
of
any
functional
analysis
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
russell.
in
fact
the
logic
would
be
that
if
the
district
court
himself,
after
having
taken
this
action,
suppose
we
came
along
with
an
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
the
next
morning.
suppose
in
jenkins,
mercado
had
been
decided
the
following
morning
and
we
had
gone
back
to
judge
travia
and
said,
well,
see
you
have
made
a
mistaken
and
he
said,
that's
right,
i've
made
a
mistake.
i
reconsider,
i
withdraw
my
prior
order,
and
i
enter
a
judgment
of
conviction.
presumably
that
would,
under
the
analysis
of
the
respondents
in
these
cases,
that
would
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
a
jury
trial
or
in
a
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
in
a
jury
trial,
there's
no
doubt
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
in
our
view,
could
order
him
to
enter
a
judgment
of
conviction,
assuming
there
is
no
other
matter
before
him
that
would
prevent
the
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
the
jury
--
it's
not
a
directed
verdict.
in
the
case
of
a
directed
verdict,
you're
dealing
with
the
defendants
and
the
government's
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
you
cannot
direct
the
verdict
of
guilty
because
that
would
defeat
the
right
to
the
jury
trial.
the
reason
why
you
can't
direct
a
verdict
of
guilty
has
nothing
to
do
with
double
jeopardy,
it
has
to
do
with
the
jury
trial
protection.
when
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean
where
he
has
found
him
not
guilty?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
have
to
realize,
this
case
here,
these
cases
this
morning
are
basically
cases
of
first
impression,
so
to
say
that
there
is
no
such
case.
i
mean,
there
maybe
no
such
case
because
there
has
been
no
litigation
in
this
area
because
there
has
been
no
power
of
the
government
to
appeal
in
such
circumstances.
mr.

when
the
--
well
there
may,
that's
of
course
up
to
you.
when
the
defendant
waives
a
jury
trial,
he
waives
his
right
to
have
an
irrational
verdict
rendered
on
his
behalf.
he
submits
himself
to
the
hands
of
the
judge.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
of
course
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
of
course
not.
we're
not
suggesting
that
he
waived
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we're
suggesting
the
different
consequences
attached.
now,
in
the
case
of
respondent
wilson,
he
had
a
jury
trial.
the
jury
found
the
facts
that
would
support
a
conviction.
the
judge
clearly
applied
to
those
facts
a
proposition
of
law
which
we
submit
is
erroneous
and
the
question
is
whether
we
can
correct
the
legal
determination.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
disturbing
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
first
of
all,
the
statute
does
not
authorize
us
and
secondly
it's
discretionary.
but
if
they
were
a
statute
authorizing
it,
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
has
held
in
the
case
called
state
against
simpson
in
322
(a)
2d
that
there
is
no
constitutional
impediment
to
a
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
statute
confides
it
to
the
discretion
and
the
appeal
statute
does
not
authorize
appeals.
so,
of
course
--
but
that
seems
to
me
a
different
point.
the
jury
performed
the
function
it
was
supposed
to
perform
here
and
had
found
respondent
wilson
guilty.
it
found
all
the
facts.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
was
going
to
turn
now
to
a
specific
discussion
of
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it's
a
determination
of
law
clearly.
it's
the
kind
of
determination
that
appellate
courts
make
everyday.
suppose
he
refused
to
overturn
it
on
the
grounds
of
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
the
case
were
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
disagreed
with
him,
it
could
only
do
so
as
a
matter
of
law.
i
think
there's
some
confusion
that's
introduced
here
by
the
fact/law
discussion.
courts
of
appeals
decide
questions
of
law.
now
sometimes,
those
questions
of
law
relate
to
whether
a
particular
fact
has
been
established
at
the
trial
of
the
case,
but
it
is
a
question
of
law
as
to
whether
that
fact
has
been
established
sufficiently
to
permit
its
acceptance.
so
that
i
think
it's
misleading
to
get
into
a
fact/law
analysis.
we
are
only
asking
and
by
the
nature
of
the
appellate
process
could
only
be
asking
for
the
right
to
raise
questions
of
law
in
the
appellate
court.
now
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
ball,
which
is
the
first
of
the
four
cases
that
we
have
to
deal
with
in
this
court,
the
defendant
was
acquitted
by
the
jury
in
a
trial
that
was
free
from
any
error
adversely
affecting
the
defendant's
interest.
co-defendants
who
were
convicted,
appealed
and
the
conviction
was
reversed
by
this
court
for
an
insufficiency
of
the
indictment.
thereafter
ball
and
his
co-defendants
were
retried.
all
three
convicted,
all
three
sentenced
to
death.
on
their
appeals
to
the
supreme
court,
this
court
held
quite
rightly
in
a
holding
with
which
we
have
no
quarrel
whatsoever,
that
mr.
ball's
acquittal
had
become
final,
that
there
was
simply
no
way
that
he
could
be
tried
a
second
time
the
jury
having
once
found
him
not
guilty.
now
in
the
course
of
so
doing,
the
court
uttered
a
dictum
which
is
one
of
our
problems
in
this
case.
it
said
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
reading
from
page
28
of
our
brief
in
jenkins
which
would
be
page
671
of
163
u.s.
the
ball
case.
it
said
“as
to
the
defendant
who
has
been
acquitted
by
the
verdict
duly
returned
and
received,
the
court
could
take
no
other
action
than
to
order
his
discharge.�?
the
verdict
of
acquittal
was
final
and
could
not
be
reviewed
on
error
or
otherwise
without
putting
him
twice
in
jeopardy
and
thereby
violating
the
constitution.
now
of
course,
nobody
was
trying
to
review
the
verdict
of
acquittal
of
mr.
ball
by
a
writ
of
error
and
so
that
the
statement
is
clearly
the
sheerest
dictum.
in
addition,
the
statement
focuses
on
a
verdict
of
acquittal.
in
the
wilson
case,
indeed
in
the
jenkins
case,
we
submit
that
we
are
not
contesting
a
verdict
of
acquittal,
but
rather
a
judgment
that
has
the
effect
of
an
acquittal
and
we
think
that's
rather
a
different
thing.
now
the
next
case
to
come
along
was
sisson
in
1904,
kepner,
excuse
me.
in
the
kepner
case,
what
happened
was
that
the
defendant
was
tried
in
the
philippines,
in
the
court
of
first
instance
and
i
think
it's
instructive
to
see
exactly
what
was
before
this
court
in
kepner.
i
am
now
referring
to
the
record
in
the
kepner
case,
at
page
3,
there
is
the
decision
of
the
court
of
first
instance.
and
what
the
court
of
first
instance
found
is
that
in
this
case,
there
is
evidence
tending
to
show
that
the
money
which
respondent
is
charged
with
unlawfully
converting
was
in
fact
appropriated
by
him
under
a
bona
fide
claim
of
right.
and
then
he
said,
“on
the
whole,
i
think
this
evidence
is
of
sufficient
weight
to
raise
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
the
existence
of
a
fraudulent
intent
which
is
an
essential
element
of
the
offense.
i
therefore
find
the
respondent
not
guilty.�?
now,
under
the
philippine
practice
then
in
effect,
the
government
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
philippines.
it
did
not
allege
errors
of
law
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
it
said
that
the
judge
of
the
court
of
first
instance
had
made
a
mistake
when
he
concluded
that
he
had
a
reasonable
doubt
about
kepner's
fraudulent
intent.
and
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
court
of
the
philippines,
whose
opinion
is
also
reproduced
here,
stated
quite
clearly
that
it
did
not
on
the
evidence
believe
mr.
kepner's
story.
well,
when
this
case
reached
the
supreme
court,
the
conclusion
of
the
court
although
there
is
a
lengthy
discussion
of
the
general
subject
of
appeals,
the
conclusion
of
the
court
is
with
reference
to
the
ball
case.
it
says
it
establishes
that
to
try
a
man,
now
i'm
looking
at
page
30
of
our
brief
in
jenkins,
“to
try
a
man
after
a
verdict
of
acquittal
is
to
put
him
twice
in
jeopardy
although
the
verdict
was
not
followed
by
a
judgment.�?
this,
said
the
supreme
court
in
kepner
is
practically
the
case
under
consideration
viewed
in
the
most
favorable
aspect
for
the
government.
the
court
of
first
instance
having
jurisdiction
to
try
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
accused,
found
kepner
not
guilty.
to
try
him
again
upon
the
merits
even
in
an
appellate
court,
is
to
put
him
a
second
time
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense.
now,
we
here
are
not
asking
to
try
mr.
wilson
or
to
try
mr.
jenkins
again
upon
the
merits
in
an
appellate
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
that
you
would
have
to
have
a
new
trial,
but
that
in
fact
the
second
proceeding
was
a
new
trial
that
was
constitutional
prohibited.
what
had
happened
was
that
court
of
first
instance
had
acquitted
on
a
factual
determination
of
reasonable
doubt
about
fraudulent
intent.
the
supreme
court
of
the
philippines
reviewed
the
evidence
in
great
detail
and
said,
we
think
that
mr.
kepner's
story
is
not
credible.
we
don't
think
he
should
have
been
believed
by
the
court
of
first
instance
and
therefore,
we
find
him
guilty.
now,
it
wasn't
the
second
trial,
in
the
sense
if
there
was
formal
evidence
adduced,it
was
a
review
of
the
record.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
they
had
--
if
it
had
been
sustained,
no.
the
issue
was
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
this
was
a
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
because
the
question
there
was
whether
the
second
trial
that
he
had
already
had
put
him
in
double
jeopardy.
it's
like
the
jorn
case
in
the
sense
that
the
question
in
jorn
was
not
whether
the
appeal
in
jorn
would
place
him
in
a
double
jeopardy,
but
whether
to
have
proceeded
with
the
trial
in
jorn
would
have
placed
him
in
double
jeopardy
and
what
the
supreme
court
basically
held
here
was
that
to
retry
him
even
in
a
court
that
you
call
an
appellate
court
is
not
permissible
under
ball.
now,
i
see
i
have
very
little
time
left.
with
respect
to
sisson,
we
don't
in
these
cases
try
to
maintain
that
sisson
is
distinguishable.
let
me
say
one
more
thing
about
kepner.
kepner
is
not
a
holding
of
this
court.
it
involved
the
philippines
act
and
in
green
and
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
his
dissent
in
hoe
(ph)
against
new
jersey,
it
is
not
binding
precedent
on
this
court.
in
sisson,
we
believe
that
sisson
is
on
all
force.
the
difference
is
that
sisson
was
interpreting
the
old
criminal
appeals
act
and
we
suggest
that
a
statement
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
think
it's
on
all
force
analytically,
that
is
in
the
jenkins
case,
we
agree
that
if
sisson
was
right
in
its
definition
of
an
acquittal
for
purposes
of
old
3731,
that
in
jenkins,
you
had
the
same
beast.
now,
we
don't
agree
in
wilson
that
you
had
the
same
beast
for
reasons
that
i
am
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
to
but
that
are
addressed
at
length
in
our
brief,
but
we
say
that
the
determination
in
sisson,
the
statement
which
was
one
paragraph
in
the
course
of
a
lengthy
and
complicated
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
white
noted
in
his
dissent,
he
didn't
believe
the
court
could
seriously
mean
as
a
constitutional
holding.
we
think
that
that
dictum
ought
not
to
be
followed
by
this
court
and
i
would
note
that
that
dictum
came
about
in
a
case
which
as
justice
harlan
himself
noted
in
sisson.
the
argument
was
exclusively
addressed
to
the
constitutional
issues,
the
court
did
not,
excuse
me,
the
statutory
issues.
the
court
did
not
have
the
constitutional
question
even
argued
before
so
that
i
think
an
off
hand
comment
unnecessary
to
the
decision
should
not
be
given
any
weight
in
concluding
this
very
important
issue
and
that
you
should
look
at
it
afresh.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'll
try
to
cover
the
ground
i
have
very
quickly.
first
of
all
with
respect
to
the
sisson
formula
of
what
is
an
acquittal.
it's
not
necessarily
to
be
read
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
read
it
because
it
says
if
it's
an
acquittal,
if
it's
a
legal
determination
on
the
basis
of
facts
adduced
at
trial
relating
to
the
general
issue
of
the
case.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
assumed
that
the
word
relating
related
to
the
facts
adduced
to
trial.
i
submit
that
the
correct
way
to
read
the
formula
in
sisson
is
that
the
word
relating
relates
to
legal
determination.
it
must
be
the
legal
determination
that
relates
to
the
merits,
and
as
marion
makes
clear
the
determination
that
was
made
here
was
not
a
legal
determination
on
the
merits.
this
is
a
legal
ruling.
we
are
not
challenging
any
facts
that
the
district
court
found.
we're
not
saying
he
was
wrong.
we
accept
every
fact
and
we
say
it
is
a
matter
of
law,
the
facts
that
he
found
don't
warrant
the
action
that
he
took.
now
with
respect
to
fong
foo,
i
think
it
is
in
fact
the
case
that
in
fong
foo
one
of
the
things
that
the
trial
judge
did
however
wrong
and
however
much
he
shouldn't
have
done
it,
was
to
say
that
on
the
basis
of
what
he
had
heard
no
jury
could
credit
the
government's
case.
that
is
he
was
ruling
on
a
question
in
power,
on
the
question
of
credibility
he
said,
no
jury
could
convict
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
--
