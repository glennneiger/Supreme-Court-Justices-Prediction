mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
is
suposed
in
this
case
is
one
that
is
fundamental
to
our
system
of
justice.
that
is,
what
rights,
procedural
rights
do
we
give
a
citizen
of
this
country
before
we
sentence
him
to
serve
six
months
in
jail?
i
think
that
the
issue
is
muddied
somewhat
by
the
procedural
context
in
which
this
case
arises.
and
i
think
it
drives
to
some
of
the
questions
that
justice
blackmun
raised
as
to
whether
this
is
a
due
process
requirement
or
rather
a
requirement
of
rule
42.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
petition
--
the
respondents
here
were
afforded
a
hearing,
that
was
not
a
rule
42
(a)
hearing,
but
at
the
same
time
they
were
not
given
a
42
(b)
hearing.
and
i
would
suggest,
very
respectfully
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
summary
contempt
--
the
summary
contempt
power
may
be
used
in
the
case
of
a
witness
who
respectfully
refuses
to
testify.
we
have
to
look
at
the
summary
contempt
power
as
that
is
contemplated
in
ex
parte
terry.
summary
contempt
power
authorizes
the
district
judge
or
the
trial
judge
to
impose
a
sentence
of
imprisonment
without
affording
the
respondent
the
right
to
counsel
or
the
right
to
say
anything
in
his
own
defense.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
consistent
teaching
of
this
court
is
that
that
type
of
deviation
from
what
we
normally
consider
the
due
process
rights
of
a
criminal
defendant
can
only
justified
by
the
most
extraordinary
need
to
protect
the
dignity
of
the
court.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
that
great
need
to
protect
the
dignity
of
the
court
is
not
present
to
justify
a
departure
from
the
more
traditional
procedures
which
due
process
encompasses.
it
seems
to
me,
we
have
a
case
where
these
two
men,
for
different
reasons
perhaps
and
in
different
circumstances,
refused
to
testify.
i
think
one
of
the
compelling
facts
concerning
the
client
i
represent,
mr.
bryan,
in
this
procedure,
is
that
he
was
forced
to
go
forward
in
the
absence
of
his
own
counsel.
counsel
was
simply
assigned
to
him
on
that
morning.
that
may
not
seem
like
a
terribly
significant
fact,
but
it
seems
to
me,
my
experience
in
representing
assigned
counsel
--
representing
assigned
defendant
is
that
the
--
it
takes
some
time
for
a
lawyer
assigned
by
the
court
to
develop
a
rapport
with
his
client.
the
rapport
that
comes
naturally
if
a
man
has
sought
you
out
to
be
his
counsel
does
not
exist
when
you
are
suddenly
thrust
upon
the
defendant
and
it
seems
to
me
that
fact
here
takes
away
the
ability
of
the
counsel
to
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
really
meaningfully
advice
the
client
of
his
rights.
and
it
seems
to
me,
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
these
respondents
should
have
had
the
right
to
counsel
before
being
sentenced
to
the
maximum
sentence
possible
in
these
circumstances,
a
sentence
of
more
than
six
months
could
not
have
been
imposed.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
it
certainly
was,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
i'm
suggesting
is
not
that
the
punishment
was
not
proper
and,
indeed,
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
by
the
government
at
some
future
time
that
in
a
situation
like
this,
it
might
be
appropriate
to
impanel
a
jury
so
that
a
more
severe
sentence
could
be
imposed,
but
that
has
to
do
with
the
punishment
fitting
the
crime.
what
i'm
suggesting,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
before
that
much
of
a
penalty,
the
maximum
penalty
available
is
imposed
that
we
have
to
afford
a
respondent
in
a
contempt
proceeding
certain
minimal
due
process
guarantees.
a
meaningful
right
to
counsel
and
i
suggest
that
the
appointment
of
counsel
that
day
was
not
a
meaningful
right
to
counsel
as
far
as
my
client
was
concerned.
i
don't
think
this
court,
if
i
had
not
shown
up
this
morning,
would
have
assigned
another
lawyer
to
appear
and
argue
this
afternoon.
i
think
you
would
say
that
the
lawyer
has
to
have
a
right
to
prepare
to
meaningfully
represent
his
client.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
also
a
possibility,
obviously,
your
honor.
but,
i
do
think
that
in
the
situation
here,
that
is
a
for
less
severe
effect
on
my
client
in
putting
him
in
jail
for
six
months.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
would
think
that,
certainly
a
24-hour
period
might
have
been
reasonable.
i
think
that
you
have
here
a
situation,
also,
i
disagree
with
the
government
that
this
procedure
is
the
most
effective
way
as
they
suggest,
is
the
most
effective
way
to
get
the
--
a
testimony
that
you
want.
it
seems
to
me,
once
the
sentence
is
imposed
--
well,
that's
where
i've
got
to
serve
and
i
deal
with
it.
a
witness
who
is
confronted
with
a
situation
where
he
is
told
that,
“i
am
sentencing
you,
i'm
ordering
the
marshal
to
take
you
into
custody
and
hold
you
in
civil
contempt.
i'm
going
to
set
this
matter
down
for
a
hearing
i
have
to
determine
if
you
should
be
held
in
criminal
contempt
and
a
sentence
to
be
imposed
will
be
fixed
at
that
time.”
and
a
witness
in
that
situation
is
more
likely
to
come
back
the
following
day
and
say,
“i've
thought
about
it
and
i
will
testify”
than
one
who
has
had
the
final
sentence
imposed
on
him.
so
that,
i
don't
think
that
the
remedy
that
the
government
suggest
is
the
most
effective
way
to
bring
about
the
testimony
that
they
seek
to
compel
here,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
consistent
teaching
of
this
court
has
been
that
summary
contempt
power
is
reserved
for
the
very
extreme
case,
and
it
is
our
submission
here
that
this
is
not
that
extreme
a
case.
the
--
there
was
no
disrespect
--
manifest
for
the
court
that
it
called
for
the
court
to
vindicate
its
authority
right
then
without
waiting
for
a
moment
so
that
people
would
know
that
the
court's
authority
exists.
this
is
not
the
situation
such
as
existed
in
terry
where
there
was
a
violent
outburst
in
the
courtroom
and
the
court
there
said,
“fine.”
there,
the
dignity
of
the
court
is
affronted
and
it
must
be
able
to
control
the
procedures
in
its
own
courtroom,
and
that
was
i
think
the
rationale
set
forth
in
cooke
versus
united
states
lays
out
those
distinctions
quite
clearly.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
am.
i
am
suggesting,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
it
is
constitutionally
deficient.
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process
to
use
summary
contempt
power
in
the
situation
before
the
court.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
merely
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
do,
and
this
is
really
what
i
was
addressing
myself
to
at
the
outset.
the
fact
that,
really,
you
have
--
the
procedure
used
here
was
not
42
(a),
but
it
was
not
42
(b).
it
was
something
in
the
middle
and
i
think
it
was
something
in
the
middle
because
the
district
judge
recognized
that
there
were
certain
minimal
due
process
rights
that
should
attach
before
you
send
a
man
to
jail
for
six
months.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
that
that
is
true.
this
was
clearly
going
to
be
a
very
short
trial
and
he
was
aware
of
that
but
as
ms.
ginsberg
pointed
out,
there's
nothing
in
the
court's
action.
indeed,
the
court's
action
totally
contradicts
the
fact
that
he
was
seeking,
by
his
order,
to
compel
testimony
right
then
and
there
because
he
stayed
the
effectiveness.
he
said,
“listen,
i
will
consider
this
again
after
the
appellate
courts
have
passed
on
it.”
so
there's
no
element
here
of
using
this
criminal
contempt
power
to
force
right
then
and
there
the
witness
to
change
his
mind
about
the
testimony.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
requires
the
court
to
say
that
42
(a)
is
constitutionally
flawed
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
i
think
terry
indicates
that,
obviously,
there
are
situations
where
you
can
impose
contempt
without
giving
the
respondent
any
right
to
reply.
but
i
think
what
the
court
has
consistently
held,
from
the
time
terry
was
decided
to
date
is
that
to
justify
that
radical
departure
from
due
process,
you
need
very
strong
and
compelling
reasons
showing
that
the
demoralization
of
the
court's
authority
would
occur.
and,
i
think
what
i'm
really
submitting
is
that
our
system
is
just
--
of
justice
is
not
so
fragile
that
it
would
collapse.
if
the
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
people
like
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
i
think
it
is
true
that
it
disrupts
the
trial.
it
has
consequences,
but
those
consequences
followed
even
though
criminal
contempt
was
imposed
here.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
right.
they
dismissed
the
three
counts
involving
the
bank
robbery
in
which
my
client
was
involved,
and
i
don't
mean
to
denigrate
the
seriousness
of
that
and,
as
i
said
before,
i
might,
if
i
were
back
in
the
solicitor
general's
office,
be
prepared
to
argue
that
you
can
impanel
a
jury
and
impose
a
substantial
sentence
more
than
was
imposed
here.
all
i'm
suggesting,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
when
you
impose
a
sentence
as
much
as
six
months
on
an
individual
that
you
have
to
afford
him
some
basic
due
process
rights,
a
right
to
some
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
present,
as
the
court
said
in
cooke,
evidence
in
either
exculpation
or
mitigation.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
in
the
anderson?
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
ultimate
sentence,
i
must
say,
i
just
don't
know,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
oh!
it's
a
serious
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
my
client
was
sentenced
to
10
years
for
the
bank
robbery.
it's
a
substantial
crime
and,
as
i
say,
i
don't
denigrate
the
seriousness
of
what
was
done
here.
i'm
just
simply
suggesting
that,
given
the
substantial
sentence,
six
months
is
a
substantial
sentence.
i
mean,
i
have
seen
men
cry
where
they've
been
sentenced
to
three
months
in
jail.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
no,
sir.
i'm
not
saying
it
is
out
of
order
with
the
magnitude
of
the
disruption,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
that
before
you
impose
a
sentence
of
that
magnitude
you
should
give
certain
minimal
due
process
rights
to
allow
the
respondent
to
have
an
opportunity
to
present
to
the
court
any
factors
in
mitigation
or
in
exculpation.
having
--
give
--
have
that
right,
i'm
not
saying
it
would've
been
inappropriate
to
sentence
him
to
six
months.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
most
instances,
that
probably
is
not
going
to
be
necessary.
i
was
--
mr.
norton's
statistics
certainly
are
not
in
conformity
with
my
experience
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
where
i
practice
primarily.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
most
cases,
you're
going
to
be
able
to
proceed
with
other
witnesses
or
other
aspects
of
the
trial,
but
adjournments
of
24
hours
are
not
unusual.
if
we
have
a
wit
--
a
juror
with
the
flu,
we
adjourn
cases
for
24
hours.
so
that,
i
don't
--
certainly,
it's
a
disruption,
but
six
months
--
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
what
did
he
need
a
lawyer
for?
i
think
he
needed
a
lawyer,
one,
to
advice
him
of
the
serious
nature
of
the
charges,
to
determine,
to
present
to
the
court,
particularly
in
mitigation
here,
mr.
justice
white,
factors
concerning
--
defending
himself
but
also
factors
that
is
to,
perhaps
even,
to
introduce
evidence
to
show
that
the
refusal
to
testify
was
not
one
that
was
simply
based
on
a
too
great
a
loyalty
to
a
friend,
but
a
real
belief
that
the
constitutional
grant
of
immunity
was
not
co-extensive
with
the
privilege.
it
seems
to
me,
if
a
man
refuses
to
answer
because
he
really
believes
that
the
district
court's
rule
is
in
error,
that
that
is
a
relevant
factor
to
be
considered
in
imposing
sentence.
it
seems
to
me,
a
man
who
just
feels
that
the
court
is
wrong
as
to
his
constitutional
rights
and
he
wants
to
protect
them
doesn't
deserve
the
maximum
sentence
possible.
mr.
john
s.
martin,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
also
that
whether
not
to
go
forward
and
testify
is
a
decision
in
those
circumstances
where
--
this
is
a
point
i
was
trying
to
make
before
that
the
witness
has
to
have
some
faith
in
the
lawyer.
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
things
that
bothers
me
here
is
that
my
client
was
asked
to
make
all
these
decisions
and
go
forward
with
a
brand
new
lawyer
assigned
to
him
that
morning.
thank
you.
