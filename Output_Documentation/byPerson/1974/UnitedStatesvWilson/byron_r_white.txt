justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
he
entered
judgment
after
the
verdict
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rest
of
judgment
was
just
to
arrest
a
forthcoming
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
see
the
rationale
in
kepner
was,
you
would
have
to
have
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no
further
--
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
philippines'
judgment
had
been
sustained,
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
under
the
philippine
practice
as
judge
friendly
said,
“no
further
proceedings
were
required
below.�?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
so,
there
was
double
jeopardy.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
ruling
really
is
that
he
should
never
been
tried
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
couldn't
be
tried
again
and
hence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
or
ever
tried.
the
ruling
is
that
he
should
never
have
been
tried.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hence
it
certainly
doesn't
invite
any
more
jeopardy?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
maybe
so,
that
may
be
so.
you
may
have
relied
on
–
his
whole
ruling
or
consideration
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
pretrial
delay,
he
may
have
been
greatly
informed
by
the
trial
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
his
ultimate
judgment
is,
he
never
should
have
been
tried
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
harris
is
just
a
construction
of
a
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
you
need,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
he
need
a
lawyer
for?
