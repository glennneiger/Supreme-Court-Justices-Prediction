mr.
gerald
p.
norton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
to
review
the
judgment
of
that
court,
reversing
the
convictions
of
respondents
wilson
and
bryan
for
criminal
contempt
of
court
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
each
was
provisionally
sentenced
to
serve
six
months
in
prison.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
trial
witness
who
refuses
to
obey
a
court
order
to
testify
may
be
held
in
criminal
contempt
pursuant
to
the
summary
procedures
of
rule
42
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
rather
than
the
notice
and
hearing
requirements
of
rule
42
(b).
our
primary
submission
is
that
the
district
courts
have
the
authority
and
the
discretion
to
use
summary
contempt
proceedings
in
those
circumstances.
we
also
contend
that
in
any
event,
in
the
particular
facts
of
this
case,
summary
contempt
procedures
were
properly
used.
the
respondents
wilson
and
bryan
both
refused
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
district
court
that
they
testify
at
the
trial
of
one
robert
anderson
on
charges
involving
two
bank
robberies:
one
of
them,
the
nanuet
bank
and,
the
other,
the
empire
bank.
prior
to
the
trial,
bryan
had
been
indicted
for
robbery
and
assault
with
dangerous
weapon
concerning
the
nanuet
robbery.
wilson
had
been
similarly
indicted
concerning
the
empire
robbery.
bryan
had
plead
guilty
to
the
assault
charge
and
wilson
to
the
robbery
charges
against
him
and
in
both
cases,
the
other
charges
were
dismissed.
now
shortly
before
the
anderson
trial
was
to
begin,
bryan
had
been
sentenced
by
judge
cooper
pursuant
to
18
u.s.
code
4208
(b)
which
provides
for
a
study
of
the
defendants
and
re-sentencing
after
a
period
of
three
months
but
which
requires
initially
that
the
maximum
sentence
be
imposed,
in
this
case,
25
years.
before
the
trial
began,
judge
lasker,
who
was
assigned
the
anderson
case,
had
been
told
that
it
would
probably
take
about
two-and-a
half
days.
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
eventually,
bryan
was
called
as
a
government
witness
to
testify
concerning
the
nanuet
robbery
and
wilson
was
called
to
testify
concerning
the
empire
robbery.
at
this
time,
both
were
incarcerated,
bryan
on
his
sentence
on
the
assault
conviction,
wilson
awaiting
sentence
on
his
robbery
conviction.
there
is
a
common
pattern
of
events
concerning
both
contempts.
first,
all
proceedings
occurred
in
open
court
with
the
jury
absent.
each
one
was
asked
questions
by
the
prosecutor
concerning
anderson
and
the
respective
robberies
beginning
with
did
they
know
anderson.
they
refused
to
answer
any
questions.
the
district
court
granted
them
immunity
pursuant
to
18
u.s.
code
6003
and
explained
the
consequences
of
that
grant
of
immunity.
he
said
that
he
would
hold
them
in
contempt
if
they
refused
to
answer.
each
again,
refused.
the
district
judge
directed
them
to
answer
and
said
he
would
hold
them
in
contempt
if
they
refused.
they
again
refused
and
he
held
them
in
contempt.
now,
the
court
had
already
received
arguments
for--
from
the
attorneys
for
wilson
and
bryan
as
to
their
grounds
for
refusing
to
testify.
at
this
time,
the
court
heard
additional
argument
concerning
the
sentencing
of
both
wilson
and
bryan,
what
alternatives
the
court
could
consider
and
what
their
motivations
and
the
reasoning
might
have
been.
wilson's
attorney
specifically
acknowledged
that
his
motivation
was
to
save
a
friend.
the
court
then
gave
wilson
and
bryan
each
the
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
each
declined
to
speak.
judge
lasker
then
sentenced
each
of
them
to
six
months
at
this
time,
as
he
put
it,
but
he
made
it
clear
that
this
was
a
provisional
sentence
subject
to
revision
and
that
he
would
consider
an
application
for
reduction.
he
made
it
consecutive
to
the
sentences
they
were
or
would
be
serving
for
their
other
convictions
in
order
to
give
the
sentence
reality
and
said,
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
point
to
it.
and,
he
specifically
noted
in
sentencing
bryan,
who
was
the
first
of
the
two
to
be
sentenced,
that
a
purpose
of
the
sentence
was
to
persuade
bryan
to
change
his
mind
and
to
testify,
and
he
said
he
would
reduce
the
sentence
to
nothing
if
he
did.
later
the
same
day,
both
sides
rested
the
case
against
anderson.
there
are
certain
facts,
before
i
go
into
the
consequences
of
their
refusals
that
are
peculiar
to
each
of
the
respondents
and
i'll
note
them
briefly,
although
we
don't
believe
that
they
are
material
to
the
central
question
presented.
though
he
had
notice
of
the
government's
intention
to
call
bryan
as
a
witness,
bryan's
original
attorney
had
been
unable
to
attend
the
anderson
trial.
he
did
submit
a
document
setting
forth
some
arguments
as
to
why
he
thought
bryan
should
not
be
required
to
testify.
at
the
court's
request,
wilson's
attorney
who
was
in
court
prepared
to
address
a
similar
problem
concerning
wilson
agreed
to
represent
bryan.
now,
in
the
course
of
the
proceedings
against
bryan,
it
had
been
argued
that
one
reason
they
declined
to
testify
was
a
fear
that
it
might
affect
their
sentencing.
in
bryan's
case,
his
eventual
re-sentencing
by
judge
cooper.
now,
this
is
a
baseless
fear
in
this
case
because,
in
pleading
guilty
and
in
discussing
the
case
with
the
probation
officer
in
connection
with
the
pre-sentence
investigation,
they
had
already
been
required
to
make
and
did
make
admissions
concerning
their
involvement,
although,
in
the
course
of
that,
wilson
declined
to
identify
his
accomplice.
in
any
event,
in
order
to
avoid
any
basis
for
such
a
claim
of
possible
effect
on
sentencing
in
wilson'
case,
judge
lasker
decided
that
he
would
try
to
sentence
him
then,
before
he
testified.
the
court
heard
the
probation
officer
report
on
what
he
would
have
included
in
his
pre-sentence
investigation
report
which
included
an
admission
of
wilson's
involvement
in
the
robbery,
and
also
heard
a
presentation
by
wilson's
attorney
as
to
wilson's
background,
his
family
problems,
and
the
substance
of
a
report
by
a
doctor
in
which
the
doctor
referred
to
wilson
as
having
an
adolescent
loyalty
to
defendant
anderson.
now,
in
making
this
effort
to
sentence
to
wilson
the
judge
stressed
that
he
thought
that
a
delay
in
anderson's
trial
and
others
scheduled
to
follow
it
was
undesirable
and
he
noted
particularly
the
fact
that
anderson
was
in
jail.
finally,
however,
judge
lasker
concluded
that
he
would
be
--
he'd
rather
defer
the
sentencing
of
wilson
who
was
after
all
facing
a
potential
sentence
of
20
years
on
a
very
serious
charge
and,
at
a
later
time,
he
sentenced
him
to
treatment
under
the
youth
corrections
act.
neither
wilson
nor
bryan
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
reconsider
their
refusal
and
to
testify,
although
it
was
admittedly
a
limited
opportunity
of
several
hours
that
day
before
the
government
rested
its
case.
as
a
direct
result
of
their
disobedience
of
the
court
orders
that
they
testify,
the
administration
of
justice
was
seriously
obstructed
in
this
case.
acknowledging
that
the
government's
case
against
anderson
concerning
the
nanuet
robbery
had
been
substantially
weakened
by
bryan's
refusal
to
testify,
judge
lasker
granted
anderson's
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case.
that
case
was
irrevocably
lost.
as
to
the
nanu
--
as
to
the
empire
robbery,
judge
lasker
noted
that
while
wilson's
testimony
was
not
as
perhaps
essential
in
the
sense
that
it
was
prima
facie
case
sufficient
to
send
the
case
to
the
jury,
it
was
not
cumulative
either.
so,
the
case
went
to
the
jury.
the
jury
disagreed
and,
as
a
result
of
the
hung
jury,
there
had
to
be
a
second
trial
with
consequent
cost
and
judicial
and
other
resources.
at
that
second
trial,
as
it
turned
out,
anderson
was
convicted
concerning
the
empire
robbery,
but
one
can
safely
assume
that
if
wilson
had
testified
at
the
first
trial,
we
might
never
have
had
a
second
trial.
on
appeals
by
wilson
and
bryan,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held,
first,
that
neither
one
of
them
had
any
legal
basis
for
refusing
to
testify
once
they
had
been
granted
immunity.
the
court
noted
in
passing
that
if
they
had
been
simply
concerned
about
the
effect
of
their
testimony
on
sentencing
there
were
other
and
better
remedies
to
deal
with
that
problem,
such
as
sealing
the
transcript
or
asking
that
they'd
be
sentenced
by
a
different
judge.
their
remedy
of
refusing
to
obey
the
court's
order
to
testify,
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
wholly
improper
approach
to
that
problem.
the
ground
for
the
reversal
of
the
convictions
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
use
of
summary
procedure
of
rule
42
(a)
is
improper
in
a
case
of
an
orderly
refusal
of
a
witness
to
comply
with
the
court
order
that
they
testify
even
if
the
witness
is
represented
by
counsel
and
even
if
the
witness
has
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
the
court
felt
hat
this
result
was
compelled
by
its
decision
in
an
earlier
case,
the
marra
case,
in
which
it
had
said
that
if
it
were
looking
at
the
question
on
a
clean
slate,
it
would
uphold
the
use
of
summary
procedure
in
those
circumstances,
but
it
felt
disabled
to
do
so
by
what
it
thought
was
the
teaching
of
this
court's
decision
in
harris
against
the
united
states,
to
which
i'll
return
shortly.
as
we
note
in
our
brief
at
page
23,
other
courts
of
appeals
have
sustained
convictions
pursuant
to
rule
42
(a)
in
similar
circumstances
and
have
disagreed,
in
effect,
with
the
second
circuit's
analysis
in
this
case.
now,
criminal
contempt
comprehends
a
spectrum
of
offenses
in
varied
types
and
degrees
of
seriousness.
it's
therefore
important
to
focus
precisely
on
the
question
here.
this
case
presents
no
claim
of
abuse
of
the
summary
contempt
to
power
by
a
judge
embroiled
in
a
heated
controversy
with
a
witness
or
a
party
or
an
attorney,
nor
is
there
any
claim
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
with
the
sentence
in
this
case,
the
maximum
sentence
here
being
six
months,
nor
do
we
have
here
a
staged
recreation
in
the
presence
of
the
court
of
a
contempt
that
was
actually
or
originally
committed
elsewhere.
the
question
here
is
simply
whether
a
so-called
respectful
refusal
of
a
witness
to
obey
a
court's
order
to
testify
or
to
give
evidence
at
trial
can
be
punished
summarily
as
a
criminal
contempt.
well
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
there
was
not,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
before
the
court
had
granted
immunity
to
the
witnesses,
there
was
a
passing
comment
by
wilson's
attorney
to
the
fact
that
she
wanted
more
time
to
consider
or
research
the
privilege
questions
which
they
were
then
discussing,
but
that
issue
evaporated
from
the
case
once
the
court
granted
the
witnesses'
immunity
and
there
was
no
objection
raised
to
the
summary
procedure
as
to
either
witness.
now,
the
question
this
court
has
not
previously
directly
resolved
the
question
in
this
case,
although
it
did
in
dictum
in
the
yates
case,
approved
the
procedure
that
was
followed
by
judge
lasker
here.
now,
18
u.s.
code
401
authorizes
federal
courts
to
punish
by
imprisonment
various
contempts,
one
of
which
is
disobedience
of
its
lawful
orders.
it's
not
disputed
here
that
the
refusals
of
wilson
and
bryan
to
obey
judge
lasker's
order
that
they
testify
constitutes
criminal
contempt
punishable
under
401.
incidentally,
i
should
note
that
although
the
district
court
docket
entries
recite
conviction
under
18-402,
it's
clear
that
the
court
intended
and
the
parties
here
have
understood
that
it
was
a
conviction
under
18-401
and
section
402
is,
by
its
terms,
plainly
inapplicable.
now,
that
a
refusal
to
testify
may
be
punishable
under
these
circumstances,
under
--
as
criminal
contempt
is
more
than
clear
from
this
court's
decision
in
harris
and
other
cases.
it's
also
clear
that
disobedience
of
a
court
order
to
testify
is
a
serious
type
of
contempt.
this
court
said
in
the
shillitani
case
that
the
power
of
a
court
to
compel
a
witness
to
testify
is
essential
to
the
administration
of
justice.
in
calandra
it
noted
that
every
citizen
owes
his
government
the
basic
obligation
to
testify
when
so
ordered.
now,
the
reason
that
the
public
has
a
right
to
every
man's
evidence,
as
the
court
said
in
the
nixon
case,
is
that
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
system
depends
upon
full
disclosure
so
that
innocent
persons
do
not
suffer,
nor
the
guilty
escape.
it's
important
to
note
in
this
regard
that
the
principle
we
contend
for
here
is
inherently
neutral
in
operation.
it
does
not
necessarily
favor
the
prosecution,
although
in
this
case
it
might.
the
same
question
would
arise
if
a
defense
witness
refused
to
testify
when
ordered
to
do
so
by
the
court.
in
such
circumstances,
the
consequence
of
recalcitrant
might
not
be
limited
to
the
extended
incarceration
of
a
defendant
but
rather,
it
could
result
in
the
conviction
of
an
innocent
person.
now,
the
central
issue
here
is
whether
the
summary
procedures
of
rule
42
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
were
properly
used
in
this
case.
the
case
is
squarely
within
the
terms
of
rule
42
(a),
in
that,
judge
lasker
saw
and
heard
the
contemptuous
conduct
and
it
occurred
in
the
actual
presence
of
the
court.
moreover,
summary
disposition
of
--
in
this
case
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
rule
42
in
distinguishing
between
those
contempts
which
should
be
subject
to
the
notice
and
hearing
requirements
of
rule
42
(b)
and
those
covered
by
42
(a)
where
summary
disposition
is
appropriate.
the
use
of
the
summary
contempt
power
is
justified
in
part
by
the
fact
that
contemptuous
conduct
often
disrupts
ongoing
proceedings.
there
is
therefore
a
need
for
a
swift
adjudication
of
whether
the
conduct
is
justified
and
lawful
and
whether
it
should
be
punished
so
as
to
end
the
disruption.
the
need
for
dispatch
is
perhaps
or
is
especially
great
with
the
recalcitrant
witness,
the
trial
witness
in
a
criminal
case,
particularly
a
jury
trial,
whether
it's
a
prosecution
witness
or
a
defense
witness.
a
defendant
has
a
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
the
court's
prosecutors
have
obligations
to
proceed
promptly.
the
defendant
may
well
be
incarcerated
so
that
any
delay
in
the
trial
for
a
cite
excursion
on
the
contempt
proceedings
or,
as
in
this
case,
for
a
retrial
because
of
a
hung
jury
puts
a
penalty
on
the
defendant.
if
the
defendant
is
ultimately
acquitted,
there
is
no
way
to
recoup
that
lost
liberty.
also,
where
a
jury
trial
is
involved,
a
suspension
of
the
proceedings
to
comply
with
the
notice
and
hearing
requirements
of
42
(b)
creates
additional
difficulties
and
expense.
now,
where
the
contempt
consists
of
the
refusal
in
the
court's
presence
to
obey
in
order
to
give
evidence
at
trial,
there
is
no
real
need
for
a
formal
hearing
required
by
42
(b).
the
primary
purpose
of
which
is
to
gain
facts
and
to
resolve
factual
disputes.
the
essential
facts
are
known
to
the
judge.
in
many
such
cases,
as
here,
the
reasons
for
the
contempt
will
also
be
known
by
the
circumstances
leading
up
to
the
original
refusal
to
give
evidence
and
the
order
to
testify.
if
there
are
relevant
facts
which
are
not
known
to
the
judge
or
other
matters
that
might
bear
on
whether
the
defendant
should
--
or
the
witness
should
be
held
in
contempt
or
the
question
of
sentencing,
they
can
be
brought
to
the
court's
attention
afterwards.
as
the
court
noted
in
groppi,
and
again
in
taylor
against
hayes,
courts
commonly
modify
contempt
judgments
on
the
basis
of
subsequent
presentations
or
developments.
in
this
case,
wilson
and
bryan
had
more
than
rule
42
(a)
would
entitle
them
to.
they
had
opportunities
to
explain
their
position
before
they
were
ordered
to
testify
and
before
and
after
they
were
held
in
contempt.
they
had
counsel
to
advice
and
assist
them
and
they
had
the
substance
of
a
hearing.
moreover,
since
conviction,
neither
one
has
made
any
effort
to
make
any
presentation
to
the
district
court
of
any
matter
that
might
have
warned
them
whether
they
should
be
held
in
contempt
or
whether
the
provisional
six-month
sentence
was
appropriate.
they
have
not
sought
any
kind
of
reconsideration
or
additional
hearing
or
tendered
any
matters
of
any
kind
beyond
offering
speculations
as
to
what
might
have
happened
had
there
been
a
fuller
hearing
than
they
in
fact
had.
indeed,
in
cases
that
are
indisputably
subject
to
the
summary
contempt
power,
there
is
likely
to
be
a
greater
basis
for
speculating
that,
a
hearing
might
have
been
useful
in
such
cases.
there
has
been
no
prior
opportunity
as
here,
to
make
some
explanation
of
why
you're
doing
what
you're
doing
and
in
many
of
those
cases,
the
conduct
where
the
witness
or
defendant
throws
a
chair
or
some
power
is
abusive
to
the
court,
there
is
a
greater
reason
for
thinking
that
there
is
some
background
causative
factor
that
deserves
some
further
exploration,
yet
summary
contempt
is
properly
upheld.
and
if
the
mere
speculative
possibility
of
some
kind
of
extenuating
circumstances
were
to
be
accepted
as
sufficient
reason
to
--
not
to
use
summary
contempt,
there
might
never
be
a
case
where
a
court
could
safely
exercise
a
power
that
all
concede
it
has.
now,
the
summary
imposition
of
the
contempt
in
this
case
is
consistent
with
the
propositions
that
the
court
should,
in
the
contempt
area,
use
the
least
power
adequate
to
the
needs
of
the
occasion
and
should
resort
to
criminal
contempt
only
if
civil
contempt
would
not
be
efficacious.
as
judge
lasker
knew,
civil
contempt
in
this
case
could
be
effective
only
for
a
brief
period.
there
were
only
a
matter
of
hours
remaining
in
the
trial.
one
could
reasonably
assume
that
wilson
and
bryan
would
be
willing
to
spend
those
hours
to
save
a
friend.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
they
were
and
that's
my
next
observation
that
first,
in
any
trial,
there's
not
likely
to
be
a
long
period
of
potential
coercive
confinement,
but
in
this
case,
in
addition,
they
were
both
incarcerated
already
so
that
any
additional
incarceration
pursuant
or
of
confinement
of
civil
contempt
would
have
been
superfluous,
which
judge
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
true.
as
judge
lasker
recognized
in
making
the
contempt
sentences
run
consecutive
to
their
sentences
on
their
convictions,
this
he
could
not
do
with
civil
contempt.
now,
in
a
case
where
civil
contempt
might
be
appropriate
because
there's
a
sufficiently
long
period
of
confinement,
a
grand
jury
witness
would
be
a
good
example
and
the
witness
is
already
incarcerated,
you
might
have
a
different
situation
because
in
some
such
cases,
at
least
if
it
was
a
prisoner
serving
an
adult
sentence
imposed
by
the
same
court,
it
might
be
possible
for
the
district
court
to
suspend
the
execution
of
that
ongoing
sentence
for
the
period
of
the
confinement
on
civil
contempt.
this
is
a
novel
approach,
recently
sustained
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
liddy
case
and
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
anglin
case.
however,
this
was
not
an
option
that
was
a
feasible
one
in
this
case
because
there
were
only
a
couple
of
hours
left
in
the
last
day
of
the
trial.
on
the
other
hand,
the
deferral
of
contempt
proceedings
required
by
42
(b)
is
not
entirely
satisfactory
here
either.
that
approach
tends
to
forgo
the
opportunity
to
coerce
compliance
during
the
period
when
it
might
be
meaningful.
it's
almost
totally
punitive.
now,
judge
lasker
recognized
here
that
summary
imposition
of
criminal
contempt
had
a
possibility
of
coercing
these
people
to
change
their
minds
and
testify.
they
had
to
face
the
likelihood,
not
only
that
if
they
had
not
been
in
jail
they
would
have
to
serve
some
time,
but
if
they
didn't
purge
their
contempt
they
would
have
to
serve
whatever
full
sentence
was
imposed.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
question
whether
the
district
court's
approach
in
this
case
was
foreclosed
by
this
court's
decision
in
harris.
the
question
presented
in
harris
was
whether
a
grand
jury
witness
who
disobeyed
a
court
order
to
testify
was
properly
held
in
criminal
contempt
pursuant
to
the
summary
procedures
of
42
(a)
where
the
original
refusal
occurred
in
the
grand
jury
room,
out
of
the
presence
of
the
court,
and
it
was
recreated
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
now,
also
unlike
this
case,
the
witness
had
unsuccessfully
requested
an
adjournment
opportunity
to
present
witnesses.
in
a
5-4
decision
reversing
its
earlier
decision
in
the
brown
case,
this
court
held
that,
although
the
refusal
constituted
criminal
contempt,
it
should
have
been
proceeded
against
under
the
notice
and
hearing
requirements
of
rule
42
(b)
since
the
real
contempt
was
not
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
in
dicta
relied
upon
by
respondents
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
majority
indicated
that
rule
42
(a)
was
reserved
for
exceptional
cases
involving
misbehavior
of
various
sorts.
even
so,
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
not
holding
42
(a)
inapplicable
to
a
case
like
this
because
it's
expressly
assumed
that
42
(a)
may
at
times
apply
to
testimonial
episodes.
and
we've
addressed
in
our
brief
the
historical
argument
as
to
whether
summary
contempt
power
can
ever
be
applied
to
disobedience
of
court
orders
as
distinguished
from
misbehavior,
and
i
will
not
address
that
further
here.
note
simply
that
a
witness'
refusal
to
obey
a
court
order
to
testify
or
to
give
evidence
is
likely
to
create,
as
here,
a
far
greater
obstruction
of
court
proceedings
than
many
of
the
mis
--
types
of
misbehavior
for
which
summary
contempt
power
is
unquestioned.
now,
the
contempt
in
harris
involved
a
grand
jury
witness
and
here
we
have
witnesses
at
a
trial.
there's
far
a
greater
need
for
speedy
action
at
a
trial
because
a
grand
jury
can
last
18
months
and
more
and
civil
contempt
may
be
summarily
imposed.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
would
not
think
so.
it's
not
necessarily
compelled
by
harris.
we
don't
have
here
the
problem
of
kind
of
staging
the
contempt
in
the
presence
of
the
court
in
order
to
come
within
the
terms
of
rule
42
(a).
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no
question.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that's
one,
that's
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right,
and
most
trials
it'd
only
take
a
few
days.
the
statistics
for
1974
in
the
administrative
office
of
the
u.s.
court
show
that
84%
of
all
cases
take
3
days
or
less
and
even
73%
of
criminal
jury
trials
take
3
days
or
less
and,
indeed,
more
than
50%
of
all
trials
take
1
day
or
less
so
that
summary
--
that
interruption
or
delay
of
proceedings
to
comply
with
rule
42
(b)
would
have
no
coercive
possibilities.
in
short,
we
don't
that
harris
compelled
the
reversal
of
the
convictions
in
this
case
and
that,
if
it
is
regarded
as
barring
those
convictions,
it
should
be
limited
or
overruled
if
necessary.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
thank
you.
the
suggestion
that
there
was
no
intention
here
to
give
mr.
bryan
and
mr.
wilson
an
opportunity
to
purge
their
contempt
i
think
is
rebutted
by
the
statement
of
judge
lasker
at
page
32
(a)
--
32
of
the
appendix
where
he
specifically
referred
to
imposing
a
sentence
for
a
period
of
time
subject
to
elimination
or
reduction
of
it
to
nothing
should
mr.
bryan
cared
to
testify
and
answer
the
questions.
that
was
plainly
his
intention,
everyone
understood
it.
they
chose
not
to
do
so.
as
for
the
possibility
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
page
32.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
of
the
appendix,
the
middle
of
it,
the
middle
of
the
page.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes.
and
other
points
he
said
he
was
making
this
provisional
sentence
in
both
cases
subject
to
reduction
or
reconsideration.
now,
the
suggestion
that
mr.
wilson's
refusal
was
based
on
some
legal
issue
as
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
immunity
to
protect
him,
i
think,
is
also
rebutted
by
the
fact
that
when
counsel
said
to
consider
the
motivation
for
what
mr.
wilson
has
done,
judge
lasker
said
“to
save
a
friend,”
counsel
“yes.”
it
is
very
clear
what
was
happening
here.
this
was
not
someone
standing
on
some
legal
principle
to
preserve
the
issue
for
appeal.
this
was
someone
who
simply
didn't
want
to
talk
to
save
a
friend.
that's
all
there
was
to
it.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it
was.
judge
lasker
explained
that,
explained
that
the
consequences
of
the
immunity
were
the
--
what
he
said
could
not
be
used
against
him
and
that
he
had
to
answer
question
put
to
him.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
don't
believe
he
specifically
said
that,
but
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
in
this
case,
your
honor,
both
wilson
and
bryan
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
--
had
admitted
their
complicity
in
the
offense.
there's
never
been
any
suggestion
what
would've
happened
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
here
if
they
testified.
it
could've
been
used
as
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
mr.
wilson
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
mr.
wilson
had
his
attorney
present.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
mr.
bryan
was
represented
by
mr.
wilson's
attorney.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
someone
else
who's
client
had
the
identical
problem
and
was
prepared
to
address
it
that
day.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
can't
speak
to
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
they
have
different
factual
situations
and
they
prefer
to
make
different
arguments.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
they
were
identical
in
as
far
as
the
question
of
whether
they
could
be
held
in
contempt
when
they
refused
to
obey
a
court
order,
they
were
in
the
identical
situation.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
if
mr.
bryan's
refusal
to
testify
was
based
on
some
misapprehension
as
to
the
scope
of
the
immunity,
then
that
is
a
fact
that
could've
been
presented
to
judge
lasker
at
any
time
in
the
20
months
or
so
since
these
convictions
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
contempt
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
contempt
is
an
unusual
creature
in
that
regard
and
as
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
--
the
chief
justice
indicated,
criminal
contempts
are
frequently
revised
after
further
presentations.
on
the
question
of
notice,
counsel
seemed
to
assume
that
one
day
would
be
sufficient.
now,
whether
that's
so
or
not
is
an
open
question.
some
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that
five-day's
notice
is
required
where
notice
is
necessary.
a
five-day
interruption
of
the
trial
would
be
something
very
different
indeed,
in
that
it
would
be
longer
than
the
trial
itself
took.
the
question
of
whether
a
sentence
under
42
(a)
is
--
has
any
coercive
effect
i
think
it's
clear
that
summary
exercise
of
the
contempt
power
is
inherently
coercive.
that
is
why
the
courts
permitted
to
exercise
it.
it
is
to
invest
immediately
some
conduct
which
obstructs
or
casts
in
a
bad
light
the
administration
of
justice.
if
the
only
purpose
were
punishment,
42
(b)
would
be
sufficient.
it
is
the
need
to
deal
immediately
that
justifies
the
summary
dispositions.
and
finally,
on
the
mens
rea
question,
i
note
simply
that,
first,
401
does
not
require
that
the
action
be
willful
as
402
does
and
that,
in
this
case,
the
defendant
had
entered
his
guilty
plea
with
no
suggestion
that
he
was
not
competent
to
stand
trial.
the
difficulties
in
sentencing
a
youthful
offender
on
a
20-year
maximum
burglary
count
are
very
different
indeed
from
determining
whether
he
has
legitimately
refused
to
answer
a
question.
thank
you.
