justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
think
that
if
the
judge
acquitted
the
man
on
illegal
grounds,
unconstitutional
grounds,
the
court
of
appeals
could
reinstate
it
now.
is
that
where
you're
going
to
end
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
either.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
a
directed
verdict
again?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
has
ordered
a
trial
judge
sitting
without
a
jury
to
find
a
man
guilty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course.
of
course,
there's
no
such
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
might
still
be
no
such
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
he
waived
the
jury
trial,
he
didn't
waive
the
double
jeopardy
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
plea?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
you
are
pretty
close?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
the
new
trial,
did
you
appeal
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
instead
of
discretion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
it
say
anything
about
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
listening?
i'm
listening.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
it
touch
it
at
all,
did
it,
didn't
anything
to
do
with
it?
the
judge
said
regardless
of
the
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence,
i
find
that
this
cannot
stand,
that's
what
he
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
contrary,
i
understand
the
government's
position
would
be
that
the
only
decision
on
guilt
or
innocence
was
made
by
the
jury
and
the
judge
that
in
itself
would
warrant.
for
some
other
reason,
the
judge
upset
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
how
can
you
say
that
one
is
law
and
one
is
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
the
government
to
say
that
if
the
judge
had
ruled
that
the
evidence
wasn't
sufficient
or
something
of
that
sort
involving
guilt
or
innocence,
it
should
be
a
different
ball
game.
but
the
judge
didn't
touch
the
decision
as
to
guilt
or
innocence
in
any
fashion,
except
to
say
that
there
shouldn't
have
been
a
trial
at
all.
now,
do
you
understand
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
the
judge
had
said
nothing
except,
“i
set
aside
the
jury's
verdict
of
guilty.�?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
acquit.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
the
government
have
right
to
appeal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
statute
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
don't
understand
the
government
is
going
as
far
as
you
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
really
on
what
immunity
he
was
getting,
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
did
he
say
that
it
couldn't
be
used
by
the
sentencing
judge?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
no,
but
there
was
something
that
was
left
out
that
this
man
didn't
understand,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
the
grant
of
immunity.
could
he
possibly
understand
it
without
getting
advice
or
thinking
it
over?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
afforded
an
attorney.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
wait
a
minute.
he
had
a
--
he
had
somebody
else's
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
that's
what
he
had.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
somebody
else's
lawyer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
witnessed
the
fact
that
they're
so
identical
that
one
of
them
said
that
that
lawyer
couldn't
represent
him
in
this
court.
that's
how
identical
they
are.
until
this
day,
they're
not
identical.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it's
what
the
record
shows
in
this
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
so
they're
not
identical.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
--
were
they
in
identical
situation
as
to
the
immunity?
did
the
fact
that
one
and
his
lawyer
understood
immunity
mean
that
the
other
one
understood
the
full
parameters
of
the
immunity?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
will
assume
that
anybody
convicted
for
murder
can
bring
habeas
corpus
50
years
later.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
doesn't
make
the
original
conviction
legal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
