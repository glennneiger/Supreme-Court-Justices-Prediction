justice
potter
stewart
why
was
the
action
brought
against
this
individual,
mr.
bisceglia,
whatever
his
name?
justice
potter
stewart
he's
a
trust
officer,
wasn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
--
it's
in
the
record
--
justice
potter
stewart
he
says
he
didn't
know
anything
about
this.
justice
potter
stewart
my
real
question
is
why
don't
you
bring
it
against
the
bank,
why
did
you
bring
--
single
out
this
individual,
this
trust
officer
here?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
smith,
it’s
clear
to
say
that
while
you
say
that
these
two
--
these
are
the
two
statutes
that
are
involved.
that's
really
an
issue
in
this
case,
isn’t
it?
your
brother
says
that
7601
is
not
involved
in
this
case
that
we
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
limited
its
consideration
to
the
language
of
7602,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
his
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
there’s
any
tax
liability
that’s
just
a
suspicion,
isn’t
there?
justice
potter
stewart
tax
liability
by
anybody,
any
person
or
any
other
entity
or
any
kind
of
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
could
there
but
for
all
anybody
knows
that
cash
deal
--
cash
dealings
of
this
magnitude
there
maybe
unusual,
i
suppose
they
are.
it
doesn’t
mean
that
person
didn’t
pay
taxes?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
means
anybody,
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
--
it
means
anybody
on
suspicion
or
even
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
a
report
from
the
bank
to
the
federal
reserve
and
that
doesn’t
indicate
at
all
that
it
was
the
depositor
of
the
bank,
that’s
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
the
31
code
of
federal
code
regulations
102.
justice
potter
stewart
102.
justice
potter
stewart
how
large
the
bank
is
this?
do
you
know
what
is
put
in
there?
justice
potter
stewart
it
must
have
been
hard
for
the
tellers
to
count,
if
it
was
hard
for
the
federal
reserve
people
to
count?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
irs,
did
it?
