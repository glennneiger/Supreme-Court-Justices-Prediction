mr.
william
a.
watson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
expand
briefly
to
some
of
the
remarks
made
by
counsel.
he
uses
repeatedly
in
his
argument
the
term
“depositor”
and
this
depositor
he
mentions
the
person
who
may
be
a
liable
for
unpaid
taxes
and
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
says
in
the
first
place
that
this
money
came
to
this
bank
from
a
depositor.
we
don’t
know
where
it
came
from.
i
made
such
a
distinction
in
my
brief
between
customers
who
may
bring
in
cash
exchange
and
a
depositor.
mr.
william
a.
watson
ot
in
my
knowledge,
but
i'm
making
a
distinction
here
as
to
the
possibility
that
it
came
in
off
the
street
as
a
cash
exchange
and
which
instance
the
record
reflects
that
there
is
no
way
of
identifying
the
source.
mr.
william
a.
watson
you're
referring
now
to
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
tcr-1?
mr.
william
a.
watson
that
form
was
not
utilized
in
this
instance
as
the
record
shows
when
this
money
went
to
the
federal
reserve
in
november.
mr.
william
a.
watson
no,
the
way
the
internal
revenue
service
came
upon
it
was
simply
that
an
employee
and
the
federal
reserve
bank
in
cincinnati
noticed
the
condition.
and
based
upon
an
earlier
experience
where
some
old
money
had
come
through
which
they
in
some
way
had
determined
have
been
buried
in
concrete,
his
suspicions
were
again
arose
on
this
transaction
and
the
irs
was
verbally
notified.
mr.
william
a.
watson
the
tcr-1
was
never
filed
by
the
bank
concerning
this
transaction
that
is
just
the
form.
mr.
william
a.
watson
oh
no,
that
is
the
report
compiled
by
the
federal
reserve
people
i
presume
your
honor
which
describes
the
entire
shipment
if
i'm
correct
about
that.
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes.
mr.
william
a.
watson
well,
sir
we
have
of
course
the
basic
question
of
whether
the
irs
can
use
the
summons
under
these
facts.
did
they
have
the
summons
with
an
authority?
mr.
william
a.
watson
well,
we
of
course
are
involved
with
confidential
relationship
of
banks
with
its
customers,
that’s
the
underlying
concern
of
the
bank.
mr.
william
a.
watson
theoretically,
yes
and
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
well,
it
means
the
bank
can
disclose
all
of
these
records.
however,
many
depositors
or
records
maybe
involved.
mr.
william
a.
watson
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
watson
that’s
right.
mr.
william
a.
watson
but
we
don’t
want
the
irs
to
rummage
through
records
of
people
who
are
not
involved.
mr.
william
a.
watson
sir?
mr.
william
a.
watson
well,
not
so
much
asking
questions
of
the
bank
but
taking
the
records
let's
say
of
a
half
of
dozen
or
a
dozen
or
however
many
depositors
may
fit
in
the
category
of
the
summons
as
narrowed
by
the
court
and
subject
innocent
depositors
to
the
invasion
of
their
privacy.
mr.
william
a.
watson
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
watson
no,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
watson
my
understanding
of
that
sir
is
that
that
is
the
--
prepared
by
the
bank,
the
federal
reserve
bank.
it
just
shows
how
much
money
came
in
and
those
two
shipments
in
cash.
mr.
william
a.
watson
they're
actually
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
well,
the
bank
--
it
was
the
commercial
bank.
local
bank
was
to
be
supposed
to
provide
that
information.
it
was
not
done
in
this
instance,
i
don’t
know
that
the
record
reflects
but
it’s
my
understanding
it
was
routinely
not
done.
and
all
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
well
the
purpose
was
very
obvious
to
comply
with
the
existing
regulation
which
required
the
reporting
of
these
currency
transactions.
mr.
william
a.
watson
those
are
not
enforced--
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
watson
it’s
the
petitioner’s
trial
exhibit
number
1
and
as
i
understand
that
that
was
prepared
by
the
federal
reserve
bank
in
cincinnati.
mr.
william
a.
watson
they
have
the
tcr-1
form
which
was
suppose
to
be
prepared
by
them
but
which
was
not
prepared
by
them.
mr.
william
a.
watson
i'm
sure
it’s
set
forth
in
the
record
somewhere
your
honor
but
i
could
not
put
my
finger
right
on
it.
mr.
william
a.
watson
well,
i
would
only
say
as
in
my
information
that
it
was
routinely
not
observed
and
likewise
by
the
federal
reserve,
they
did
not
routinely
require
it
to
be
observed.
mr.
william
a.
watson
well,
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
sir?
mr.
william
a.
watson
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
in
what
context
you
asked
the
question
judge,
when
you
say
that
is
our
case.
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes
and
i
presumably
that
maybe
why
the
bank
did
not
provide
the
information
on
the
form.
the
record
does
not
reflect
precisely
the
reasons
is
why
it
was
not
supplied
in
the
first
place.
this
apparently
was
not
in
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
there
was
a
treasury
regulation
in
a
effect
which
is
mentioned
in
the
footnote
in
the
sixth
circuit’s
opinion.
mr.
william
a.
watson
102.1
mr.
william
a.
watson
that
have
been
in
effect
apparently,
since
around
1959
according
to
that
footnote,
but
there
were
no
sanctions
involved
as
i
understand
it.
there
are
sanctions
under
the
present
domestic
currency
reporting
requirements
of
the
bank
secrecy
with
this
court
took
up
last
term.
mr.
william
a.
watson
terms
of
total
assets
around
18
million
as
(inaudible).
mr.
william
a.
watson
at
the
main
branch,
you
have
about
3,
2
at
the
other
branch.
i
have
say
6
or
7
be
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes.
mr.
william
a.
watson
presuming
that
a
single
individual
brought
it
in
and
a
single
amount,
yes,
i
think
your
honor
would
be
correct
and
i
think
the
record
shows
that
perhaps
mr.
bisceglia
answered
that
affirmatively.
mr.
william
a.
watson
i
don’t
know
of
any
presumption
along
those
lines
sir
and
in
fact
i
don’t
know
of
any
presumption
that
old
money
is
tainted
money.
this
is
the
basis
of
the
government’s
suspicion,
but
people
do
keep
money
--
they
keep
it
long
time
in
odd
places.
it
doesn’t
mean
that
when
they
finally
bring
it
in
that
it
necessarily
represents
a
fraud
on
the
irs
or
any
other
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
i
would
think
that
they
must
have
some
strong
reason
for
indulging
the
authority
and
i
think
they
must
act
within
the
authority
of
the
statute.
they
say
that
this
is
enough
to
justify
their
actions
here.
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
watson
more
than
inquiry
i
would
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
william
a.
watson
[laughter]
or
some
like
that,
but
again
in
that
instance,
you
have
a
taxpayer.
you
know
that
there
is
a
taxpayer.
you
are
not
asking
to
someone
whereas
perhaps
we
could
use
the
example
of
a
man
who
sells
new
automobile.
he
sells
a
cadillac
car.
can
an
irs
walk-in
to
his
office
and
say
you
must
sell
to
a
lot
of
people
with
a
lot
of
money.
i
want
to
see
all
your
records.
i'm
not
investigating
anybody
i'm
just
curious.
now,
what's
the
limit
on
official
curiosity?
mr.
william
a.
watson
it
does
not
to
my
knowledge
sir.
it’s
just
they
were
all
deteriorated
$100
bills.
mr.
william
a.
watson
presumably
so.
of
course
the
district
judge,
as
you
know
from
the
record,
suggested
that
the
agent
was
making
a
mountain
out
of
a
mole
here
that
there
was
an
easier
way
procedurally
anyway
to
get
to
this
and
that
was
to
summons
the
head
teller
who
was
mrs.
dorothy
sulfrage
(ph)
and
in
fact
the
record
shows
that
agent
bruecher
talked
to
her
and
she
could
not
recollect
at
the
time
and
suggested
perhaps
the
records
might
refresh
her
recollection.
she
was
never
summons
either
by
summons
or
by
subpoena.
of
course
we
get
into
another
can
of
worms
if
she
had
been
and
what
might
have
happen
then
but
it
was
the
district
court’s
thinking
that
in
any
bank
he
had
ever
been
in
and
the
teller
would
remember
without
the
necessity
of
invading
all
these
records.
mr.
william
a.
watson
i
think
so
if
it
was
a
deposit
and
they
had
furnished
that
information,
it
would
have
been
there.
mr.
william
a.
watson
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
a.
watson
as
i
understand
it,
now
again
that
is
not
precisely
stated
in
the
record,
but
that’s
the
information
that
i
have.
mr.
william
a.
watson
well,
i
think
so
because
under
the
currency
act,
you're
not
only
have
the
requirement
of
reporting
domestic
transactions
of
$10,000
but
you
also
have
sanctions
to
whereby
the
secretary
(voice
overlap)
is
not
reported.
mr.
william
a.
watson
i
would
think
so
yes.
mr.
william
a.
watson
unless
we
challenge.
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes
sir,
unless
it
were
challenged
on
some
appropriate
ground.
of
course,
the
currency
reporting
act
talks
in
terms
of
$10,000
currency
transactions
again.
we
don’t
know
(voice
overlap).
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes,
sir.
of
course
the
sixth
circuit
decided
in
this
case
as
you
know
was
simply
on
the
basis
that
those
four
requirements
set
forth
in
7602
did
not
apply.
they
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
or
the
philosophical
issue
if
you
will.
they
simply
said
did
you
had
to
have
a
taxpayer
at
least
identifiable,
if
not
by
name
as
an
existing
taxpayer
or
in
the
case
of
the
tax
preparer
cases
upon
which
the
united
states
relies
there
was
known
to
be
taxpayers
whose
returns
have
been
prepared
by
those
people
and
the
government
wanted
to
check
them.
now,
every
circuit
court
and
district
court
which
has
talked
about
the
bisceglia
since
its
rendition
has
distinguished
bisceglia
on
the
facts
from
all
of
these
other
cases
and
i
don’t
know
the
same
authority
for
the
government’s
position
here.
mr.
william
a.
watson
i
don’t
give
that
broad
in
interpretation
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it
is
implicit
in
that
phrase
as
in
the
others
that
you
know
a
taxpayer
exists,
you
know
or
have
reasonably
he
hasn’t
made
a
return
and
you're
going
to
make
one
for
him
which
of
course
the
irs
has
the
authority
to
do.
mr.
william
a.
watson
i
don’t
think
so.
i
really
don’t
think
so
even
its
old
money
i
don’t
think
that
presumption
arises.
mr.
william
a.
watson
not
unless
it
knows
the
name
of
a
taxpayer,
but
certainly
they
must
know
that
there
is
a
taxpayer.
i
don’t
think
the
irs
has
the
authority
just
to
browse.
mr.
william
a.
watson
we
can’t
assume
that,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
watson
alright.
mr.
william
a.
watson
i
would
be,
yes.
mr.
william
a.
watson
it
has
no
business
in
the
record.
mr.
william
a.
watson
i
don’t
think
that’s
any
of
their
business.
mr.
william
a.
watson
no,
sir.
that’s
invading
a
private
transaction
for
no
lawful
purpose
absent
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
not
under
the
statute
i
don’t
believe,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
watson
they
do
it
every
and
they
would
certainly
do
it
to
every
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
--
every
single
customer
of
this
bank
has
that
fits
this
category
if
they
were
disclosed.
mr.
william
a.
watson
if
i
am
to
prepare
of
his
return?
mr.
william
a.
watson
oh,
i
think
they're
entitled
to
have
it.
they
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
well,
sir
it
may
go
farther
than
i
would
go
if
i
wrote
the
statute,
but
they
have
the
statutory
authority
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
held
in
donaldson
and
some
other
cases
that
they
can
see
the
records
of
third
parties
and
that
there
is
no
abuse
into
the
self-incrimination
or
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
per
se
on
that
basis.
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes,
then
that
question
must
be
face
if
this
court
feels
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
not
on
these
facts.
mr.
william
a.
watson
i
would
just
as
happy
if
the
court
affirms
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
basis
the
opinion
was
written.
mr.
william
a.
watson
well,
the
court
of
course
could
remand
for
that
purpose
but
and
i
think
that
will
be
just
a
satisfactory
with
me
but
i
believe
our
ground
is
solid
on
that
issue.
i
think
that
this
does
--
mr.
william
a.
watson
this
does
go
far,
far
beyond
any
reasonable
seeking
of
corporate
records
and
of
course
this
court
has
suggested
in
the
california
bankers
case,
a
corporate
identity
does
not
have
an
absolute
right
and
an
unqualified
right
to
conduct
its
affairs
in
secrecy
or
privacy
but
that
it
does
have
some
privileges
in
that
regard
and
perhaps
if
the
court
gets
into
constitutional
question
it
will
have
to
decide
what
those
limits
are.
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes
confidentiality
of
the
records.
mr.
william
a.
watson
it
was
before
i
believe.
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes,
a
petition
for
a
rehearing
i
think
came
also
before
the
california
bankers
case.
mr.
william
a.
watson
i
believe
i'm
correct
on
that
maybe,
yes
sir.
this
sixth
circuit
decision
was
decided
october
18,
1973.
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes
sir,
i
think
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
a.
watson
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
watson
if
this
court
has
no
further
question,
i
will
close.
