mr.
watson,
may
i
get
back
to
this
page
16
petitioners’
file
exhibit
one.
i'm
confused
about
this
report
is.
who
prepared
it,
that
your
client
or
the
federal
reserve
bank?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
the
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
who’s
suppose
to
fill
in
under
nature
of
transactions
whether
it’s
a
deposit
or
withdrawal,
exchange
of
currency,
cashing
or
purchasing
check,
who
is
suppose
to
fill
out
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
that
suggest
mr.
watson,
if
we
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
interpretation
of
the
statutes,
what
we
would
do
about
the
constitutional
question
that
you
raised
and
that
the
sixth
circuit
didn’t
(voice
overlap).
because
as
i
understand
that
the
only
question
you
raised
was
the
fourth
amendment
for
this,
wasn’t
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
don’t
think
you’ve
already
decided
that
in
some
of
these
other
cases?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
what
would
you
have
us
do?
decide
the
fourth
amendment
question
here
or
send
it
back
for
the
sixth
circuit
to
decide
it
first?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
know
but
suppose
we
don’t,
suppose
we
disagree
with
the
sixth
circuit
on
the
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
the
decision
below
pre
or
post
are
this
court’s
think
cases
last
year.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
before
and
was
there
a
petition
for
rehearing
that
came
after
or
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
before
and
it
was
disposed
of
before?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
i
misunderstood
you
i
thought
(voice
overlap).
