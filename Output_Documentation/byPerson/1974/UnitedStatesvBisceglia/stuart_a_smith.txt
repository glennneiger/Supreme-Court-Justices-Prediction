mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
on
the
government's
petitioner
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
it
arises
from
the
issuance
of
an
internal
revenue
summons
in
the
course
of
an
investigation
by
the
internal
revenue
service
into
a
series
of
unusual
currency
transactions.
specifically,
the
question,
a
statutory
one,
is
whether
the
internal
revenue
service
has
power
to
issue
a
summons
in
order
to
discover
the
identity
of
a
person
who
maybe
liable
for
unpaid
taxes.
the
bank
involved,
where
the
unusual
currency
transactions
occurred,
is
the
commercial
bank
of
middlesboro,
kentucky
of
which
respondent
bisceglia
is
a
vice
president.
the
facts
are
basically
simple
and
undisputed.
in
november
1970,
the
commercial
bank
deposited
on
two
separate
occasions,
$20,000.00
in
$100.00
bills
with
the
federal
reserve
bank
in
cincinnati
which
was
a
branch
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
cleveland.
these
bills
as
the
testimony
characterized
them
in
the
district
court
were
tissue
paper
thin
which
suggested
a
long
period
of
storage,
and
perhaps
in
an
unusual
place.
on
the
regular
federal
reserve
procedures,
the
matter
was
reported
by
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
cincinnati
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
deposit
of
such
a
large
amount
of
cash
was
unusual
in
this
context
and
it
was
especially
unusual
for
the
bills
to
be
badly
worn.
for
example,
the
testimony
developed
that
during
the
first
10
months
of
this
year
in
1970,
the
commercial
bank
of
middlesboro
had
only
deposited
with
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
cincinnati,
218
$100.00
bills.
and
here
within
a
two
week
period
in
november
1970,
it
deposited
an
additional
400
of
them.
this
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
in
the
context
of
this
case,
such
a
large
amount
of
cash
was
unusual
and
perhaps
i
think
the
internal
revenue
service
might
not
have
been
alerted
in
the
context
of
a
large
commercial
center
such
as
new
york.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
facts,
the
fact
that
this
case
might
arise
in
new
york
would
limit
the
statutory
power
of
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
there
are
only
4
--
my
impression
is
there
were
only
400
$100.00
bills,
a
total
of
$40,000.00
but
these
were
the
--
this
was
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly,
these
were
regulations
that
the
federal
reserve
maintained
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
bank
secrecy
act
which
the
court
considered
last
term
in
the
california
bankers
association
case.
but
the
federal
reserve
procedures
were
to
report
this
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
now
from
the
internal
revenue
service's
point
of
view,
this
event
suggested
that
substantial
transactions
had
occurred
outside
normal
financial
channels.
in
fact,
the
supervisor
of
the
currency
section
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
in
cincinnati
testified
that
it
was
his
recollection,
the
only
comparable
situation
where
bills
were
so
badly
worn
is
to
be
tissue
paper
thin
that
the
sizing
of
the
paper
had
completely
disintegrated,
were
difficult
to
count,
had
occurred
in
the
situation
where
a
cash
hoard
had
been
stored
in
milk
cans
which
in
turn
had
been
buried
in
concrete.
now,
this
kind
of
situation
suggested
to
the
internal
revenue
service
that
the
recipient
of
this
cash
hoard
may
well
have
received
it
in
a
manner
and
not
pay
--
and
had
not
satisfied
a
tax
liability
on
it.
now
the
possibilities
are
numerous.
it
could
be
an
amount
of
money
that
was
received
and
hidden
away
for
which
income
tax
was
not
paid
on.
it
could
have
been
hoard
of
someone
who
died
and
estate
taxes
may
not
have
been
paid
upon
it.
it
could
have
been
a
gift
to
someone
in
which
case,
the
donor
may
not
have
paid
the
gift
tax
on
it.
because
of
these
possibilities
which
are
--
we
believe
reasonable
to
the
internal
revenue
service,
the
internal
revenue
service
commenced
an
investigation.
and
in
the
course
of
that
investigation,
it
issued
the
summons
to
the
commercial
banks
of
middlesboro
and
to
mr.
bisceglia
specifically
to
produce
all
records
in
connection
with
the
deposit
of
this
matter
that
may
shed
some
light
on
the
deposit
of
the
matter.
now
because
the
tax
--
because
the
identity
of
the
taxpayer
was
unknown
in
this
instance,
the
irs
summons
was
drawn
“in
the
matter
of
the
tax
liability
of
john
doe.”
but
it
was
fully
contemplated
that
once
the
identity
of
john
doe
were
established
to
the
service
to
the
satisfaction
that
the
service
would
then
commence
an
order
of
the
taxpayer
or
the
depositor's
or
transferor's
tax
returns
and
inquire
as
to
the
means
of
acquisition
of
this
cash
hoard
and
to
determine
whether
all
tax
liabilities
have
been
satisfied
on
it.
and
the
bank
refused
to
comply
with
the
summons,
so
the
united
states
commenced
this
action
which
was
on
a
petition
for
enforcement
of
the
summons
under
section
7604
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
and
the
--
after
holding
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he
was
an
officer
of
the
bank
who
supervised
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he's
a
trust
officer
of
the
bank
but
he
had
supervisory
power
over
the
records.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he
had
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
he
personally
may
--
didn't
have
any
knowledge
of
the
--
the
respondent
argues
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
my
impression
was
that
this
officer
of
the
bank
was
singled
out
as
someone
who
had
the
supervisory
power
over
the
records
who
could
produce
that.
the
summons
asked
for
two
things.
it
asked
for
production
of
records
which
mr.
bisceglia
i
think
indisputably
had
the
power
to
direct
the
internal
revenue
service
to
the
examination
and
it
also
asked
the
testimony.
now
the
respondents
make
a
point
of
the
fact
and
mr.
bisceglia
could
not
have
testified
as
to
the
--
as
to
the
circumstances,
but
we
think
that
the
production
of
the
records
is
key
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
adjourned
yesterday,
i
have
set
forth
the
facts
of
this
case
which
are
essentially
that
internal
revenue
service
summons
was
served
upon
respondent
an
officer
of
the
bank
in
order
to
determine
the
identity
of
the
depositor
or
transferor
of
some
400
$100
bills
that
were
in
seriously
deteriorated
condition.
summons
was
drawn
in
the
matter
of
the
tax
liability
of
“john
doe”
because
the
identity
of
the
depositor
was
what
the
internal
revenue
service
wanted
to
ascertain.
now,
respondent
refused
to
comply
and
after
a
hearing
held
in
the
united
states
district
court
brought
by
the
government
.the
district
court
narrowed
the
summons
to
require
production
of
all
cash
deposit
tickets
equaling
$20,000
during
a
one
month
period,
october
16,
1970
to
november
16,
1970
since
the
federal
reserve
bank
in
cleve
--
in
cincinnati
had
received
this
cash
on
november
6
by
ticket
and
10
or
15
days
later
and
also
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
that
was
one
part
of
the
order.
the
second
part
of
the
order
involved
the
production
of
the
deposit
tickets
of
cash
equal
to
an
excessive
$5,000.
the
district
court
felt
that
in
that
way
by
narrowing
the
summons
in
that
regard
the
identity
of
the
depositor
could
be
ascertained
with
the
minimum
of
disruption
to
the
bank.
now,
respondent
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
which
reversed
and
it’s
the
correctness
of
that
statutory
ruling
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
no
statutory
authority.
the
issue
of
summons
before
it
has
discovered
the
identity
of
the
particular
person
it
wishes
to
investigate.
i
think
before
i
discussed
the
statutes
in
some
detail,
i
think
it’s
important
to
state
at
the
outset
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
this
case
does
not
involve
any
application
of
a
constitutional
protection
to
the
production
of
records
by
the
bank.
i
think
that
the
court’s
decision
last
term
in
california
bankers
association
has
made
clear
that
there
is
no
claim
of
privilege
against
self-incrimination
which
would
be
applicable
by
the
bank.
its
officers
or
in
behalf
of
these
unknown
taxpayers
who
may
be
incriminated
by
the
records
sought
by
the
summons.
these
are
third
party
records
which
are
not
protected.
so
the
case
therefore
presents
a
statutory
question,
the
narrow
focus
of
which
is
upon
two
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code
which
are
presently
set
forth
at
section
7601
and
section
7602
of
the
code.
there
set
forth
on
pages
2
and
3
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
7601
of
the
code.
there
set
forth
in
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief
under
the
caption
statutes
involved.
now,
these
statutes,
we
submit
our
cast
in
the
broadest
possible
terms.
section
7601
admonishes
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
has
delegate
here
the
commission
of
internal
revenue
to
proceed
from
time
to
time
through
each
internal
revenue
district
and
inquire
after
and
concerning
all
persons
therein
who
be
may
be
liable
to
pay
any
internal
revenue
tax.
section
7602,
which
affords
the
service
to
summons
power
designed
to
implement
this
canvass
power
in
section
7601
also
is
cast
in
broad
terms.
and
that
these
two
statutes
which
the
court
recognized
in
the
donaldson
case
to
be
both
closely
related
and
rooted
in
statutes
enacted
more
than
a
century
ago
which
we
believe
provide
the
statutory
power
for
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
issue
was
summons
like
this,
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'm
aware
that
there
is
dispute
about
7601
but
in
our
view
the
statute
--
that
the
power
of
the
internal
revenue
service
which
we
believe
congress
has
accorded.
it
can
be
viewed
by
looking
at
these
statutes
in
danville.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
believe
so.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
consider
in
detail
the
terminology
of
these
statutes
which
i
think
are
critical
to
a
resolution
of
this
case.
as
i
said,
section
7601
talks
about
a
canvass
power
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
proceed
from
time
to
time
and
it
talks
about
inquiring
after
and
concerning
all
persons
in
our
view
a
broad
phrase.
now,
when
you
get
the
answer
of
section
7602,
the
statute
talks
about
four
purposes
for
which
a
summons
like
this
can
be
issued.
it
talks
about
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
correctness
of
any
return
for
making
a
return
where
none
has
been
made
for
determining
the
liability
of
any
person
for
any
internal
revenue
tax
or
collecting
any
such
liability.
now,
we
think
that
the
summons
in
this
case
plainly
falls
within
the
statutory
purposes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
believe
it
would
because
we
think
that
the
summons
that
was
issued
in
this
case
falls
within
the
statutory
purpose
of
section
7602
alone.
when
we’re
talking
about
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
correctness
of
any
return
making
a
return
where
none
has
been
made
etcetera,
etcetera,
we
think
that
if
the
internal
revenue
service
--
the
proper
way
to
view
do
this
case
is
as
the
initiation
of
a
process
and
which
these
statutory
purposes
are
fully
applicable.
in
this
particular
case,
the
internal
revenue
service
does
not
know
the
identity
of
this
depositor
whose
transactions
are
indeed
suspicious.
i
think
it’s
undisputed
that
these
transactions
are
suspicious
and
presumably
once
the
identity
is
ascertained
via
the
summons
power.
then
this
internal
revenue
service
will
go
on
to
ascertain
the
correctness
of
the
depositor’s
return,
make
a
return
if
none
had
been
made,
determine
his
liability
under
the
third
purpose
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
in
fact,
the
third
purpose
of
the
statute
determining
the
liability
of
any
person
for
any
internal
revenue
tax,
we
think
it’s
sufficiently
broad
enough
to
cover
this
case
because
what
we’re
talking
about
here
is
the
statute
does
not
confine
itself
in
the
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
confined
it
to
a
determination
of
the
tax
liability
of
unidentified
person
rather
it
talks
about
the
liability
of
any
person
for
any
internal
revenue
tax.
and
we
think
that
what
congress
has
done
here
is
to
accord
the
internal
revenue
service,
the
power
to
answer
what
we
think
is
the
basic
fundamental
question
in
the
enforcement
of
any
law.
that
is
who
is
responsible,
who
has
breached
his
responsibility
under
the
law
in
the
context
of
the
revenue
statutes
it
simply
a
question
of
who
has
not
fulfilled
his
civil
tax
liability.
that’s
what's
involved
here
and
we
think
the
statute
covers
it.
now,
what
the
court
said
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
there
is
no
particular
taxpayer
under
investigation.
now,
in
our
view
that
is
not
correct
in
any
sense
that
is
meaningful
when
one
considers
the
services
statutory
responsibility
to
ascertain
and
to
go
through
the
internal
revenue
districts
and
to
determine
the
liability
of
any
person.
it
is
only
correct
in
the
sense
which
we
think
is
a
trivial
sense
that
the
identity
of
the
person
has
not
been
ascertained
this
yet.
but
there
is
no
doubt
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
particularized
person
under
investigation
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it
is
a
suspicion
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
but
we
think
that
there
has
--
an
event
has
occurred
here
which
has
properly
raised
the
suspicion
in
the
internal
revenue
service
that
there
is
a
tax
liability
involved
here.
cash
dealings
of
this
magnitude
are
unusual
and
in
this
context
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
it
doesn’t
but
our
point
simply
is
that
congress
has
given
the
internal
revenue
service
the
power
to
ascertain
the
identity
of
such
a
person
and
then
to
determine
whether
he
has
in
fact
that
it
is
quite
possible
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
does,
it
indeed
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that’s
right,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
harlan
in
setting
forth
the
criteria
in
the
powell
case
under
which
an
internal
revenue
service
summons
could
be
issued
said,
that
one
of
the
purposes
and
there
were
four
was
that
the
investigation
must
be
conducted
pursuant
to
a
legitimate
purpose
and
the
second
test
that
he
used
was
whether
inquiry
was
relevant
to
that
purpose.
i
think
under
these
circumstances,
the
internal
revenue
service’s
desire
to
ascertain
the
identity
of
the
depositor
in
this
case
under
these
circumstances
is
a
legitimate
inquiry
and
that
is
a
legitimate
investigation
and
that
the
inquiry
to
ascertain
his
identity
is
a
relevant
to
that
purpose.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
indeed,
i
think
we
would
do
so
and
that
essentially
all
of
those
acts
would
fall
quite
well
within
the
statutory
purposes
here.
i
think
that
it
would
unduly
cripple
the
internal
revenue
service’s
power
to
ascertain
the
tax
liability
in
determent
of
any
person
if
the
rule
in
this
case
promulgated
by
court
of
appeals
that
first
the
identity
of
the
person
had
to
be
ascertained.
well,
with
the
law
here,
i
think
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
a
broader
power
to
under
these
statutes
to
ascertain
the
identity
of
the
person
under
investigation.
indeed,
the
depositor
here
is
a
particularized
person
or
persons.
now,
what
the
respondent
has
said
here
essentially
is
in
support
of
the
court
of
appeals’
test
that
no
particular
taxpayer
is
under
investigation.
now,
in
an
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
american
bankers
association,
they,
in
facing
these
broad
statutory
purposes
of
section
7601
and
7602
say
simply
that
with
respect
to
the
statutory
phrase
determining
the
liability
of
any
person
for
any
internal
revenue
tax,
they
would
impose
a
gloss
on
that
provision.
they
would
say
that
the
internal
revenue
service
either
had
to
have
the
name
of
the
person
or
some
evidence
of
liability.
now,
we
say
with
respect
to
their
first
test,
we
think
that's
answered
by
the
fact
that
we
have
a
particularize
depositor
here.
with
respect
to
whether
the
internal
revenue
service
had
some
evidence
of
liability,
we
would
submit
that
that
would
resurrect
the
very
probable
cause
requirement
which
the
court
firmly
rejected
in
powell.
the
internal
revenue
service
is
not
bound
by
any
probable
cause
requirement
in
issuing
the
summons
or
that
it
need
have
is
an
official
suspicion.
and
indeed
under
these
circumstances,
the
suspicions
are
amply
justified
by
the
transactions
that
occurred
in
this
case
and
not
only
the
magnitude
of
the
money
involved
but
the
fact
that
the
money
was
found
in
rather
unusual
condition
which
suggested
a
long
period
of
storage.
people
do
not
usually
keep
money
in
an
airless
place
unless
they
are
hiding
if
for
some
reason
and
we
think
under
these
circumstances,
the
internal
revenue
service
had
ample
justification
to
seek
the
identity
of
the
depositor
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
to
keep
the
currency
itself
or
the
serial
number?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
provision
in
the
code
that
requires
that,
but
there
are
of
course
reporting
requirements
--
federal
reserve
reporting
requirements
that
were
involved
here
which
is
how
the
internal
revenue
service
picked
those
transaction
off.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don’t
think
so
because
mr.
chief
justice
if
you
look
at
page
16
of
the
record
appendix,
you
can
see
the
copy
of
the
report
of
the
currency
transaction
that
was
filed
by
the
federal
reserve
bank
in
this
case.
it’s
simply
talks
about
amount
to
denominations
of
$100
or
higher
and
you
can
see
in
the
third
column
of
that
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
here,
these
two
instances
within
10
days
of
a
deposited
$20,000
in
hundreds
and
there's
a
notation
to
hundreds
in
deteriorated
condition
apparently
from
long
period
of
storage.
and
there
is
a
bank
in
--
and
the
name
of
the
bank
the
federal
reserve
bank
is
at
the
bottom
and
the
name
of
the
depositor
bank
is
at
the
top.
now,
we
think
it’s
absolutely
clear
on
the
basis
of
power
that
there
is
no
probable
cause
requirement
that
binds
the
service.
indeed,
the
court
analogized
the
power
of
internal
revenue
service
in
this
case,
the
power
to
the
inquisitorial
power
of
a
grand
jury
and
surely
the
grand
jury
can
sit
in
and
investigate
the
entire
industry
for
a
particular
period
of
time
and
look
in
and
call
people
before
it
to
offer
testimony
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
to
investigation.
now,
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
what
we
think
is
rather
strong
legislative
history
in
supported
of
this
statutory
argument
that
the
internal
revenue
service
has
this
power.
in
1954,
at
the
time
of
the
codification
of
the
present
tax
law,
the
summons
power
and
the
canvass
power
represented
an
amalgamation
of
three
different
provisions
which
were
in
the
1939
code
and
which
in
turn
date
back
to
statutes
going
back
as
far
as
1864.
now,
the
particular
statute
which
we
think
is
relevant
to
section
3654
(a)
of
the
1939
code
which
similarly
talks
about
the
internal
revenue
service’s
power
to
look
into
and
to
insure
that
the
tax
laws
are
being
faithfully
obeyed
and
that
the
collector
had
this
power.
and
we
think
it
is
not
without
significance
that
in
1878
when
congress
was
debating
the
very
sort
of
procedural
question
is
to
whether
to
transfer
or
to
a
court
the
summons
powers
that
were
held
by
collectors
to
another
agents
in
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
debates
made
a
reference
to
an
incident
where
the
internal
revenue
service
served
as
summons
upon
a
railroad
in
order
to
ascertain
the
identity
of
a
shipper
of
liquor
which
was
believed
to
have
been
shipped
on
tax
and
the
railroad
complied
with
that
provision
--
with
that
summons
and
offered
up
its
books
of
account
in
connection
with
that
inquiry.
of
course
there
was
no
income
tax
in
1878,
but
there
were
excise
taxes
on
liquor
and
we
think
that
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
fact
that
if
it
accorded
this
power
to
the
internal
revenue
service
to
ascertain
the
identities
of
persons.
now,
we
think
further
that
this
legislative
understanding
which
is
--
was
almost
100
years
ago
--
occurred
almost
100
years
ago
is
also
reflected
in
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts.
indeed,
apart
from
this
case
and
the
humble
oil
case
which
is
presently
pending
on
the
government’s
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
which
i
would
imagine
the
court
is
holding
in
connection
with
the
disposition
of
this
case.
the
circuits
have
pretty
well
uniformly
given
the
internal
revenue
service
the
power
to
ascertain
the
identities
of
unknown
persons.
one
of
the
prime
examples
of
this
power
is
in
connection
with
tax-return
preparers.
four
circuits
have
held
that
tax-return
preparers
must
under
compulsion
of
an
internal
revenue
summons
issue
give
over
to
the
internal
revenue
service
the
names
and
social
security
numbers
of
their
clients
when
the
internal
revenue
service
has
reason
to
believe
that
the
preparer
has
filed
returns
which
may
not
be
completely
accurate.
i
think
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
save
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
just
want
--
i
think
the
court
is
clear
on
this
point
and
that
is
this
form
tcr-1.
i
just
want
to
clarify
it.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
this
was
--
in
other
words,
the
commercial
bank
of
middlesboro
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
then
existing
code
--
provisions
in
the
code
of
federal
regulation
so
that
when
the
moldy
money
hit
the
federal
reserve
bank,
the
federal
reserve
bank
in
effect
can
filled
the
to
form
that
the
bank
should
have
to
comply.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
exactly.
now,
of
course
under
the
bank
secrecy
act,
there
are
criminal
sanctions
for
failure
to
report,
so
presumably
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
we
have
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
we
think
the
fourth
amendment
claim
is
insubstantial
here
because
of
the
district
court’s
narrowing
of
the
summons
which
we
think
removes
any
claim
that
it’s
unreasonable
or
overbroad
of
course
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
it
was
never
decided
of
course
the
court
has
discretion
to
consider
it
as
an
alternative
basis
to
affirm
but
we
think
that
if
the
court
does
consider
it
that
there
is
no
basis
for
it,
but
the
discretion
is
broad
enough
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
think
that
would
be
a
perfectly
a
reasonable
disposition
of
the
case
since
it
is
a
factual
matter
and
while
the
district
court
considered
the
facts
of
the
case
to
court
of
appeals
did
not
have
an
opportunity
to
face
the
issue
in
the
way
it
disposed
to
the
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that
under
the
bank
secrecy
act,
there
are
criminal
fines
now
but
not
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
under
the
new
act,
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no
under
the
--
at
the
time
there
were
no
sanctions
whatsoever,
it
was
theoretically
a
voluntarily
thing
that
the
federal
reserve
bank
expected
member
banks
and
banks
that
dealt
with
that
used
the
federal
reserve
facilitates
to
make
these
submissions.
indeed,
it’s
because
of
the
kind
of
failure
in
this
case
that
congress
finally
addressed
the
problem
and
put
some
teeth
in
the
law
with
respect
to
the
reporting
requirements.
i
have
no
further.
