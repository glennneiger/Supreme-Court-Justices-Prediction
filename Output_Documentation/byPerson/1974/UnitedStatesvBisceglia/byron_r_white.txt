justice
byron
r.
white
seven
tellers,
i
think
the
record
tells
us
something
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
these
bills
came
in
of
the
street,
i
take
that
the
record
indicates
it
was
a
most
unusual
street
day
or
period
because
this
is
the
only
time
apparently
they
have
this
kind
of
deposit?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
surely
wouldn’t
be
usual
for
the
--
somebody
to
bring
in
$40,000
in
$100
within
a
two-week
period
and
want
to
change,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
suppose
you
don’t
have
to
make
that
presumption
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
watson,
does
the
record
show
whether
this
that
the
old-fashioned
big
bills
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask
mr.
watson?
i'm
looking
at
judge
mccree’s
opinion
footnote
1
at
page
9-a
of
the
government’s
petition
in
which
this
sentence
appeared.
it
does
appear
however
that
this
regulation,
that’s
regulation
102,
required
the
commercial
bank
in
this
case
to
file
a
form
tcr-1
in
which
of
course
the
information
sought
by
the
irs
in
this
proceeding
would
have
been
disclosed.
does
that
mean
that
had
commercial
complied
with
the
regulation
the
name
of
the
depositor
would
have
appeared
in
a
tcr-1?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless,
you
said
the
regulation
was
invalid
on
the
same
basis
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
we
take
the
subpoena,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
incidentally,
the
answer
the
question
i
first,
put
you
prepared
this
petitioner’s
trial
exhibit
1
according
to
judge
mccree
it
was
as
you
suggested
prepared
by
the
cincinnati
branch
of
the
federal
reserve.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
as
i
understand
vis-à-vis
the
internal
revenue
service
under
the
statute
and
the
regulation
have
no
authority
whatsoever
that
it
may
anything
unless
without
it
knows
the
name
of
the
taxpayer
and
the
breadth
of
the
subpoena
has
something
to
do
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
mean
browse?
let's
assume
there
could
only
talk
within
that
subpoena
there's
only
be
one
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
assume
it
for
the
moment
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn’t
you
still
be
taking
the
same
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
it
isn’t
a
browsing
process
at
all.
just
as
if
you’re
search
is
done
but
unless
internal
revenue
service
either
knows
the
name
of
the
taxpayer
or
knows
the
tax
liability,
it
has
no
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
will
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
record
indicates
the
petitioner
of
rehearing
was
denied
november
16,
1973?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
would
be
before
bank
cases
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
was
no
further
petition
for
rehearing.
