mr.
watson
looking
at
this
page

the
report
to
the
federal
reserve
at
the
right,
it
seems
to
be
column
where
is
suppose
to
be
indicated
whether
a
deposit,
withdrawal,
exchange
of
currency,
cashing
or
purchasing
a

is
that
right?

i'm
looking
at

--
the
report
for
the
federal
reserve.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
that’s
right.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
it
not
you?
i
thought
mr.
smith
told
us
this
was
the
report
by
which
the
internal
revenue
came
upon
this
transaction?
justice
william
o.
douglas
was
this
ever
used?
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
watson
could
--
does
a
record
here
show
i
don’t
recall
how
many
customers
did
any
into
this
category
you
described
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
one
month?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
does
not
show
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
reporting
by
whom?
justice
william
o.
douglas
reporting
by
your
client.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
then,
then
is
this
a
report
by
your
client?
you’ve
been
telling
us
it
was
something
prepared
by
the
federal
reserve?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
what
is
your
claim?
prepare
in
the
way
we
report?
justice
william
o.
douglas
where
is
that?
is
that
form
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
that
is
your
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
that
is
your
case?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
you're
not
--
you
don’t
want
to
supply
it
because
of
the
reasons
that’s
stated
in
your
argument?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
i
gather
what
you're
telling
is
that
the
commercial
bank
did
not
comply
with
the
regulation.
justice
william
o.
douglas

justice
william
o.

but
may
that
have
been
changed
by
the
currency
act
of

justice
william

here,

we?
you

reported
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
what

if
we
disagree
with
the
sixth
circuit
on
