mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
exemption
three
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
covers
matters
that
are
specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
by
statute.
the
question
in
this
case
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
whether
by
this
provision
congress
contended
to
continue
in
effect
the
large
number
of
prior
and
existing
federal
statutes
which
provided
for
non
disclosure
of
government
material
on
various
terms
and
conditions.
rather
than,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
is
limited
to
particular
statutes
would
specify
the
particular
material
involved
and
which
provide
a
more
specific
standard
for
non
disclosure
than
the
public
interest.
the
case
involves
certain
documents
produced
by
the
federal
aviation
administration
which
it
does
pursuant
to
its
systems
worthiness
analysis
program
which
i
shall
refer
to
by
its
commonly
accepted
acronym
of
(scrap).
what
these
reports
are,
are
the
result
of
a
program
that
the
federal
aviation
administration
conducts
involving
a
detailed
study
and
analysis
of
air
carrier
systems.
they
study

i'm
sorry
mr.
justice,
swap,
i
apologize.
mr.
freidman

another
case,

swap.
it
involves
a
detailed
study
and
analysis
of
the
operations
and
the
maintenance
programs
of
the
carriers
to
ascertain
whether
the
carriers
own
programs
are
functioning
properly.
the
purpose
of
the
program
is
to
try
to
uncover
before
they
mature
anything
that
might
lead
to
an
unsafe
operation.
a
major
aspect
of
this
program
is
free
and
frank
discussion
between
the
team
of
faa
people,
the
swap
team
that
conducts
the
investigation
and
the
management
of
the
carrier.
they
discuss
the
thing,
they
analyze
the
problem,
they
point
out
the
difficulties.
in
an
affidavit
on
filing
this
case
that
is
uncontroverted
by
mr.
shaffer,
the
administrator
of
faa
which
is
set
forth
to
pages
40
to
42
of
the
record.
he
explains
how
this
thing
operates
and
the
importance
of
the
informal
frank
discussion.
he
said
the
--
this
is
page
40,
paragraph
six,
“a
swap
investigative
team
works
in
close
cooperation
with
airline
management,
defined
any
area
of
maintenance,
operations,
management
or
overall
performance
which
needs
improvement.
the
system
depends
upon
the
frank
and
full
disclosure
of
the
airline.
it
also
points
out
that
the
information
investigated
includes
financial
and
operational
matters
which
would
not
customarily
be
released
to
the
public
and
that
much
of
the
material
is
of
the
nature
which
would
not
be
disclosed
to
competitors.”
and
then
in
paragraph
number
12
on
page
41,
he
says,
“the
swap
program
operates
with
the
understanding
between
the
airlines
and
the
faa
that
the
information
will
not
be
disclosed
to
the
public.”
at
the
end
of
the
swap
investigation
which
may
take
anywhere
from
two
weeks
to
much
longer
and
as
conducted
by
team
of
four
or
five
people,
a
final
report
is
made
in
which
detailed
findings
are
made,
the
problems
of
the
carrier
analyze
and
recommendations
are
proposed.
now,
neither
the
report
nor
the
informational
findings
in
it
is
made
available
to
the
public
although
as
mr.
shaffer
said
at
page
42
of
the
record
in
his
affidavit,
the
findings
made
by
the
scrap
team
are
frequently
disclosed
to
the
carrier
management
in
order
to
enable
that
it'll
be
the
kind
of
frank
discussion
that
is
necessary
and
to
enable
the
carrier
to
take
corrective
action.
the
respondent
in
this
case,
mr.
robertson
is
connected
with
the
center
for
the
study
of
responsive
law
and
as
director
of
the
aviation
consumer
action
product
--
project.
in
december
of
1970,
this
group
was
conducting
a
study
of
airline
safety
and
they
requested
the
federal
aviation
administration
to
make
available
to
them
all
of
the
swap
reports
for
1969.
the
administration
refused
to
do
this.
they
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
and
while
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
pending,
the
air
carrier
industry
appearing
for
the
air
transport
association,
its
trade
association
requested
the
administrator
under
section
1104
of
the
federal
aviation
act
not
to
disclose
this
material.
section
1104
which
is
set
out
at
pages
three
to
four
of
our
brief
provides
that
in
response
to
a
written
objection
to
disclosure
of
either
information
contained
in
an
application
report
or
document
filed
with
either
the
civil
aeronautics
board
of
the
federal
aviation
administration
and
i
will
refer
in
this
case
only
to
the
administration
or
information
that
the
administration
is
obtained
pursuant
to
the
act
when
such
a
written
objection
is
made,
the
administrator
shall
order
the
information
withheld
from
public
disclosure
when
in
his
judgment
a
disclosure
of
the
information
would
adversely
affect
the
interest
of
the
person
seeking
non
disclosure
and
is
not
required
in
the
public
interest.
the
letter
by
which
the
air
transport
association
requested
the
administration
to
keep
this
information
confidential
as
set
forth
at
pages
112
to
113
of
the
record
and
in
that
letter,
they'd
point
out
that
the
information
which
they
give
to
the
swap
teams
during
the
investigation
voluntarily
is
not
required
to
be
disclosed
by
any
regulation
of
the
federal
aviation
administration
and
they
said,
“if
public
disclosure
of
the
swap
reports
were
made,
the
interest
of
aviation
safety
would
be
endangered
of
being
subordinated
in
some
degree
to
legal
considerations
and
the
presentation
of
information
to
the
faa.
they
also
pointed
out
that
the
present
informal
practice
of
frank
and
free
discussion
said
encourages
a
spirit
of
openness
on
the
part
of
airline
management
which
is
vital
to
the
promotion
of
aviation
safety.
on
the
basis
filing
this
submission,
the
administrator
made
a
determination
under
section
1104
which
is
set
forth
at
page
115
of
the
record
deciding
not
to
make
public
to
swap
reports.
he
made
the
determination
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
disclosure
of
the
information
in
the
reports
would
adversely
affect
the
interest
of
the
airline
being
investigated
and
is
not
required
in
the
public
interest.
following
this
determination,
the
faa
denied
reconsideration
of
the
respondent's
request
for
the
swap
reports,
the
suit
was
brought,
the
district
court
ordered
disclosure
of
the
swap
reports
and
a
divided
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
majority
held
two
things
basically.
first,
it
held
that
the
reference
in
section
1104,
the
material
specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
by
statute
was
only
applicable
if
the
statute
itself
specify
the
documents
or
categories
of
documents
and
authorizes
to
be
withheld
and
it
said
that
1104
didn't
come
within
this
because
it
didn't
specify
any
particular
class
of
documents.
secondly,
it
said
that
the
standard
in
section
1104
of
the
public
interest
was
not
a
specific
exemption
by
statute
within
the
meaning
of
exemption
3.
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
rob
in
which
he
referred
to
the
legislative
history
which
i
will
elude
to
shortly,
pointing
out
that
the
strong
congressional
intent
in
exemption
3
to
continue
the
effectiveness
of
this
large
number
of
statutes
and
he
said,
he
didn't
believe
in
the
light
of
that
that
exemption
3
could
be
viewed
as
repealing
by
implication
the
specific
provisions
of
section
1104.
now,
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
enacted
because
of
the
satisfaction
with
the
way
the
old
public
information
section
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
had
worked.
there
was
considerable
feeling
in
congress
and
elsewhere
that
under
the
statute,
the
public
was
not
being
furnished
the
information
that
was
entitled
to
received
and
one
serious
floor
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
its
mink
opinion
two
terms
ago
was
one
of
the
provisions
of
that
statute
which
permitted
to
the
withholding
from
disclosure
of
material
relating
to
any
function
of
the
united
states
requiring
secrecy
in
the
public
interest
and
it
was
felt
that
this
standard
which
was
a
general
standard
covering
the
whole
gambit
of
government
operation
just
didn't
provide
any
guidelines
that
government
officials
could
easily
say,
“we
think
it's
not
in
the
public
interest
to
disclose
and
then
keep
it
secret.”
the
response
congress
gave
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
generally,
generally
to
open
up
all
identifiable
government
records
to
disclosure
but
subject
to
nine
specific
exemptions.
and
of
course,
the
nine
specific
exemptions
dealing
with
various
areas
reflected
a
recognition
that
the
effective
operation
of
government
requires
in
some
instances
that
material
be
kept
confidential
in
order
to
permit
the
government
to
function
properly.
mr.
freidman
only
exemption
3
mr.
justice.
mr.
freidman
we
may
mr.
justice
because
the
exemption
sometimes
overlap
but
we
think
on
this
issue,
we
think
that
we
are
entitled
to
prevail
under
exemption
3.
now
of
the
nine
exemptions
that
congress
created,
seven
of
them
contain
their
own
standards,
two
of
them
however
do
not;
exemption
3
and
exemption
1
which
this
court
had
before
in
the
mink
case
which
referred
to
matter
specifically
required
by
executive
order
to
be
kept
confidential.
the
two
provisions,
these
were
exemption
3
and
exemption
1
in
effect
incorporate
by
reference
other
standards
of
confidentiality
which
reflected
in
one
case
in
an
executive
order
and
the
other
case
in
statutes.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
enacted
in
1966
therein
existence
a
large
number
of
government
statutes,
the
numbers
are
uncertain,
there
are
some
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
80,
78,
almost
a
hundred
but
these
are
all
statutes
in
which
congress
specifically
dealing
with
a
particular
problem
had
concluded
that
government
information
should
be
kept
confidential.
the
terms
of
these
statutes
vary.
in
some
instances,
they
provided
generally
that
the
material
was
to
be
made
public
unless
it
was
determined
by
the
administrative
agency
or
the
government
official
who
should
be
kept
confidential
as
in
this
case,
other
instances
there
are
for
situations
in
which
the
statute
provided
that
the
material
was
to
be
generally
kept
confidential
unless
the
government
official
decided
that
it
should
be
made
public.
the
terms
varied
also
whether
it
dealt
with
the
general
categories
of
material
or
dealt
with
specific
material
and
it
also
varied
with
respect
to
the
basis
upon
which
the
government
official
would
act.
now,
we
think
the
legislative
history
shows
in
the
background
and
the
freedom
of
information
act
shows
that
when
congress
in
exemption
3
referred
to
material
specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
by
statute,
what
it
meant
to
do
was
to
preserve
intact
all
of
these
existing
statutes.
it
used
we
think
the
words
specifically
exempted,
not
in
terms
that
the
statute
specify
the
particular
documents
to
be
withheld
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
as
our
opponents
argue
but
that
the
statute,
it
was
the
statute
that
specified
non
disclosure
in
terms
rather
than
merely
implying
it
that
is
a
statute
which
would
be
relied
upon
because
of
the
public
policy
reflected
in
the
statute
as
by
implication
sanctioning
non
disclosure.
the
purpose
--
the
purpose
of
exemption
3
and
the
purpose
of
the
whole
freedom
of
information
act
was
to
eliminate
the
prior
practice
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
by
which
all
government
officials
could
just
keep
anything
they
wanted
secret
on
a
simple
decision
that
it
was
required
in
the
public
interest.
we
have
set
forth
considerable
detail
in
our
brief
the
legislative
history
of
exemption
3
and
each
shows
that
over
a
period
of
eight
years
during
which
congress
considered
a
number
of
bills
containing
this
identical
language
that
the
congress
was
aware
that
there
are
large
number
of
these
statutes
and
that
congress
intended
not
to
change
them,
to
keep
them
intact,
to
leave
them
as
they
were.
let
me
just
refer
to
two
items
which
i
think
show
this
rather
clearly.
in
the
1966
house
committee
report
which
we've
quoted
at
page
18
of
our
brief
which
was
the
report
on
the
bill
actually
enacted.
the
committee
stated
that
there
are
nearly
100
statutes
or
parts
of
statutes
which
restrict
public
access
to
specific
government
records.
this
would
not
be
modified
by
the
public
records
provision
of
s.
1160
which
is
the
bill
ultimately
enacted.
then
over
on
page
19
as
a
statement
by
senator
hruska
during
the
1963
hearings
at
an
earlier
phase
of
the
consideration
of
these
litigation,
i'm
sorry
senator
long,
i
stand
corrected
who
was
one
of
the
sponsors
and
proponents
of
the
bill
and
what
he
said
was,
“statutes
which
curtail
the
availability
of
information
to
the
public
are
not
intended
to
be
affected
by
the
enactment
of
this
bill
and
two
sentences
after
than,
it
should
be
made
clear
that
this
bill
in
no
way
limits
statutes
specifically
written
with
the
congressional
intent
of
curtailing
the
flow
of
information
as
a
supplement
necessary
to
the
proper
functioning
of
certain
agencies.”
in
other
words,
what
congress
was
doing
here
was
it
was
deferring
to
the
judgment
of
earlier
legislative
bodies
made
as
result
of
specific
consideration
of
the
particular
problem,
it
was
deferring
to
their
judgment
that
in
certain
situations
that
was
to
be
non
disclosure.
it
did
not
intend,
we
think
very
clearly
by
exemption
3
to
repeal
by
implication
any
of
these
existing
statutes.
we
think
the
case
does
closely
parallels
the
mink
case
where
in
the
mink
case
it
was
argued
that
because
the
executive
order
that
was
relied
on
is
the
basis
for
classifying
the
material
secret
and
top
secret
did
not
itself
refer
to
the
particular
documents
the
claim
was
they
are
not
covered
by
exemption
1
that
this
court
rejected
it.
similarly
it
seems
to
us
here
the
fact
that
the
particular
statutes
may
not
have
been
as
detailed
and
specificity
may
vary
considerably
that's
no
basis
for
saying
that
congress
didn't
intend
them
to
be
covered
or
the
congress
intended
in
each
instance
for
the
court
considering
this
and
i
add
for
the
administrative
official
having
to
make
the
decision
whether
to
disclose
for
him
to
try
to
figure
out
whether
the
particular
statute
was
specific
enough
to
bring
it
within
the
coverage
of
exemption
3.
congress
was
not
making
that
kind
of
a
determination.
congress
was
adapting
all
of
these
many,
many
statues
that
have
previously
been
enacted
and
was
leading
him
as
they
worth,
it
said
in
effect,
“we
will
accept
what
other
congresses
have
concluded
when
they
specifically
dealt
with
a
particular
problem.”
now,
our
opponents
tell
us
it's
inconsistent
with
the
determination
that
congress
made
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
eliminate
the
old
public
interest
standard
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
while
at
the
same
time
to
have
intended
to
permit
the
nondisclosure
material
under
the
standard
in
section
1104
which
refers
to
the
public
interest.
we
think
there's
a
very
significant
difference
between
it
because
in
1104,
congress
made
a
specific
determination
with
respect
to
the
circumstances
under
which
the
material
of
the
federal
aviation
administration
was
to
be
disclosed.
they
weren't
saying,
this
wasn't
part
of
a
program
under
which
everybody
could
disclose.
congress
made
the
determination
way
back
in
1938
when
it
first
enacted
the
civil
aeronautics
act
that
when
there
was
a
protest
to
material
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
aviation
administration,
that
it
was
up
to
the
administrator
with
his
expert
judgment
to
balance
on
the
one
hand
the
entry
that
would
result
to
the
people
protesting
the
documents.
that
is
the
adverse
affect
upon
the
people
who
were
protesting
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
public
interest
in
disclosure.
it
left
it
to
the
administrator
to
make
that
balance.
that
is
congress
and
this
statue
specifically
focused
on
this
problem.
and
we
--
mr.
freidman
that
is
correct.
he
may
have
had
to
make
a
somewhat
different
determination
under
the
old
freedom
of
information
act,
i'm
sorry
under
the
old
administrative
procedure
but
he
certainly
could've
withheld
under
this
statute
and
now
would've
been
no
basis
on
which
i
don't
think
that
could've
been
obtained
prior
to
the
freedom
of
information
act.
so,
the
basic
argument
of
course
is
that
somehow
in
exemption
3,
when
they
spoke
of
a
material
specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
and
statue,
they've
somehow
by
implication
repeal
the
provision
of
1104
and
we
don't
think
that's
what
congress
intended,
we
think
that
congress
intended
to
continuality
statutes
act.
mr.
freidman
well,
i
don't
think
so
mr.
justice.
i
don't
understand
them
to
say
that
the
enactment
of
the
entire
statute
repeal
1104.
mr.
freidman
yeah.
well
and
that
--
mr.
freidman
yeah,
but
my
only
point
was
mr.
justice
if
1104
is
not
under
exemption
3
and
if
we
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
covered
by
the
other
exemptions,
the
practical
effect
of
that
is
that
at
least
as
far
as
1104
is
concerned,
the
administrator
can
no
longer
rely
on
that
provision.
it
seems
to
me
as
a
basis
for
keeping
it
confidential
and
that's
the
provision
that
congress
provided
almost
40
years
ago
and
we
therefore
think
that
the
administrator
correctly
in
this
case
that
the
swap
reports
are
materials
specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
under
exemption
3
and
that
therefore
the
respondents
are
not
entitled
to
obtain.
thank
you.
mr.
freidman
i
just
like
to
say
one
think
in
rebuttal.
this
as
we
read
the
statue
in
the
history
of
it
and
the
language
of
it,
there's
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
language
of
exemption
3
suggesting
that
congress
intended
to
limit
the
applicability
of
the
statutes
that
it
was
continuing
to
once
that
reflected
a
particular
type
of
legislative
judgment.
we
think
the
congress
speaks,
we
don't
know
how
many
other
70,
80,
90
or
100
but
congress
intended
to
keep
all
of
them
in
existence
that's
what
the
legislation
--
mr.
freidman
that
is
precisely
it
mr.
justice
and
the
reason,
the
reason
for
this
we
think
is
that
when
congress
came
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
what
to
do
with
prior
statutes
that
provided
for
non
disclosure,
it
decided
to
leave
the
situation
as
it
was
and
in
this
statute
1104
represents
a
particularized
congressional
treatment
of
this
problem.
congress
decided
in
this
area,
it
was
going
to
leave
it
to
the
informed
discretion
of
the
administrator
reflecting
on
the
one
hand
entry
to
the
people
who
were
protesting
it
and
second
on
the
other
hand
whether
despite
this
entry,
it
was
required
in
the
public
interest
and
we
think
congress
in
exemption
3
intended
to
defer
to
that
judgment
and
as
in
this
case
when
the
administrative
made
that
judgment,
exemption
3
requires
that
this
material
not
be
disclose.
thank
you.
