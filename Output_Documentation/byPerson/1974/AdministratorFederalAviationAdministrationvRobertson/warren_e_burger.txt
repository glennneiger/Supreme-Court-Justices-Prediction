federal
aviation

mr.

i
think
you
may
begin
whenever

ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.

mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
morrison,
was
this
inquiry
prompted
by
some
formal
study
of
some
sort
i
couldn't
quite
bring
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
in
private
did
i
see.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
he
obtain
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock.
mr.
morrison,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
illogical
or
extraordinary
about
the
fact
that
congress
in
passing
acts
in
such
sweeping
terms
would
not
pause
to
try
to
identify
all
of
the
specific
statutes
which
they
had
previously
passed
granting
nondisclosure,
the
acts
of
congress
known
it
by
some
administrative
decision,
anything
unusual
about
their
saying
as
to
all
the
matters
on
which
we
previously
made
a
legislative
judgment
or
going
to
preserve
that
privilege
of
non
disclosure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
between
--
it
lost
me
there
mr.
morrison
as
to
different
kinds
of
legislative
judgments.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
the
role
about
the
same
and
although
some
good
some
bad
but
they're
all
on
the
same
level
in
terms
of
how
they
do
it
aren't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
morrison.
mr.
freidman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you
gentlemen.

case
is
submitted.
chief
justice

announce
in
