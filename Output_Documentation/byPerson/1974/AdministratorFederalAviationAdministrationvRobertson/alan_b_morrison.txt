mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
began
in
the
summer
of
1970
when
the
respondents
and
others
sought
to
learn
more
about
aviation
safety
in
this
country.
and
they
sought
access
to
a
number
of
documents
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
including
the
swap
reports
which
are
the
only
documents
that
still
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
robertson
and
mr.
simonelli
were
both
engaged
in
an
ongoing
study
of
the
aviation
as
to
mr.
robertson
as
still
engage
and
that
mr.
simonelli
is
a
student
and
now
and
has
left
that
particular
study
which
we
were
just
working
on
for
that
particular
summer
but
they
are
engaged
in
the
continuing
ongoing
surveillance
through
the
aviation
consumer
action
project
of
trying
to
find
out
whether
all
aspects
of
the
aviation
industry,
that
is
the
safety
aspects
which
are
handled
by
the
faa
which
is
before
us
in
this
case
and
whether
the
economic
aspects
handled
by
the
cab
or
designed
in
the
way
and
operated
in
the
way
to
benefit
the
public
and
consumers
at
large.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
correct
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
absolutely
your
honor
and
that's
one
of
the
important
aspects
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
why
it's
different
from
the
law
before
1966
when
justice
rehnquist
mentioned
just
a
minute
ago
that
regardless
of
whatever
test
it
was
your
honor.
it
wouldn't
made
any
difference
what
testified
because
a
citizen
had
to
be
properly
and
directly
concerned
with
the
information
before
it
could
prior
loose
from
the
government
and
there
was
no
way
that
an
ordinary
citizen
just
simply
wanting
to
find
out
whether
airlines
are
operating
properly
could've
gotten
this
information
regardless
of
whether
1104
was
an
actual
barrier.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
absolutely
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right.
the
congress
made
the
legislative
judgments
in
1966
as
to
what
ought
to
be
withheld
as
being
in
the
public
interest
and
everything
else
had
to
be
disclosed,
it
was
in
everything
had
to
be
disclosed
but
for
the
specific
exemptions.
so,
the
respondents
wanted
these
documents
for
two
reasons;
one,
to
check
on
the
airlines
themselves,
to
see
whether
the
airlines
were
doing
what
they
could
to
prevent
actions
from
taking
place
before
they
took
place,
and
second
to
see
whether
the
faa
was
doing
its
job
keeping
an
eye
on
the
airlines.
and
while
their
request
was
administratively
pending,
the
ata,
the
air
transport
association
on
behalf
of
28
airlines
on
be
known
to
the
respondents
sent
a
two-page
letter
to
the
faa
which
is
reproduced
at
pages
112
and
113
of
the
appendix
and
they
simply
said,
“we
invoke
1104
and
ask
you
to
invoke
1104
to
prohibit
these
documents
from
being
disclosed.”
section
1104
permits
two
agencies
and
only
two
agencies
of
the
government;
the
faa
for
safety
and
the
cab
for
economic
regulation
matters
relating
to
the
airlines
to
withhold
from
the
public
any
document
that
those
agencies
see
fit
if
they
make
the
determination
that
to
release
the
documents
is
not
required
in
the
public
interest.
now,
without
the
knowledge
of
the
respondents
and
without
asking
for
their
position,
the
faa
simply
based
on
these
two-page
conclusory
letter
ruled
that
all
past,
present,
and
future
swap
reports
that
might
be
prepared
by
any
administrator
or
under
his
direction
of
the
faa
from
now
or
hereafter
were
to
be
exempt
if
not
in
the
public
interest
regardless
of
the
special
need,
regardless
of
the
special
circumstances
or
anything
whatsoever,
it
was
almost
a
rule
forever
and
ever
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
your
honor,
the
government
says
that
we
could
take
an
appeal
on
that
order
under
49
u.s.c.
section
1486.
the
cab
and
the
faa
have
jurisdictional
appeals
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
suppose
to
the
district
court.
i
don't
know
what
the
test
for
standing
is
going
to
be
under
that
provision.
i
would
think
that
the
government
would
assert
--
may
well
assert
that
we
have
to
have
a
specialized
interest.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right.
my
point
is
not
that
the
--
specifically
that
that
determination
was
wrong
although
i
believe
it
to
be
wrong
and
was
so
urgent
your
honor.
but
i
believe
that
the
problem
is
created
by
the
fact
that
if
for
instance,
the
government
is
correct
that
we
do
have
a
remedy
and
assuming
that
they
don't
argue
standing
and
then
we
can
get
into
court,
we
then
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
for
instance.
well,
there
we
are
in
the
court
of
appeals
with
our
1104
issue
but
meanwhile,
the
government
has
said,
“oh,
you
can't
get
these
documents
for
three
other
reasons.”
exemption
4
says
they're
confidential
commercial
financial
information.
exemption
5
says
these
are
intra-agency
memoranda,
all
of
which
of
course
were
prepared
by
the
faa,
although
of
course
given
to
the
airlines
and
then
they
also
said
well
they're
investigatory
files.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor,
but
at
least
i
would
like
to
now
where
i
can
take
my
client
to
court.
do
we
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
all
the
claims
and
if
we
go
there
with
all
the
claims,
are
the
busy
judges
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
going
to
try
the
factual
questions
arising
under
these
exemptions,
what
about
other
rights?
rights
to
expedition,
rights
to
standing,
rights
to
attorney's
fees,
all
of
these
are
special
rights
created
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
do
we
take
them
all
with
us
to
the
court
of
appeals
as
we
go
under
1486?
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
to
that
question
is
but
if
we
don't
go
there,
do
we
go
to
the
district
court
and
do
we
have
a
bifurcated
proceeding
of
some
kind
with
one
proceeding
in
one
court
and
one
on
the
other.
these
problems
your
honor
are
not
insoluble.
they
could
be
worked
out
if
were
necessary
but
we
suggest
that
the
very
practical
reasons
counsel
against
having
this
kind
of
a
situation
where
we
end
up
in
one
court
with
one
issue,
one
in
another
issue
and
create
a
procedural
quagmire
which
congress
surely
never
could've
intended
and
can
readily
be
averted
by
simply
saying
to
the
faa
and
the
cab,
“look,
you're
just
like
everybody
else.
you
got
all
the
rest
of
your
defenses
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
don't
look
for
a
homerun
with
section
1104
because
that's
what
it
is.
it
takes
this
right
out
of
the
ballpark
any
document
whatsoever
in
the
possession
of
the
administrator
or
the
cab,
it's
out.
we
can't
get
it
unless
we
can
convince
the
court
of
appeals
according
to
the
government
that
it's
not
in
the
public
interest.
what's
the
standard
of
review
and
that
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
we're
entitled
to
a
trial
de
novo.
are
we
going
to
have
a
trial
de
novo
on
this?
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i'm
sure
the
government
wouldn't
argue
that
we're
entitled
to
it.
so,
there
we
are
back
with
a
very
limited
scope
of
review
based
upon
the
kind
of
record
we
have
here
which
is
almost
non
reviewable.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
in
most
cases,
the
government
agencies
wants
a
final
authoritative
ruling
by
either
this
court
or
appropriate
court
of
appeals
has
been
issued
has
been
following
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
has
been
adhering
to
the
rule
that's
been
annunciated
and
we
would
expect
as
it
happened
in
this
case
your
honor,
once
we
were
judged
to
be
entitled
to
the
mrrs,
those
are
the
mechanical
reliability
reports
that
were
not
appeal
by
the
government.
we
got
those
reports,
we
will
put
on
the
mailing
list
and
it's
my
understanding
that
anyone
now
can
go
in
and
ask
for
the
same
reports
and
get
them
just
as
we
do.
so,
i
would
assume
that
the
good
faith
of
the
government
would
be
such
that
no
one
would
have
to
sue
the
faa
again
to
get
these
particular
reports.
we
would
be
more
than
glad
to
furnish
him
to
anyone
who
was
prepared
to
pay
the
cost.
thus
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
for
copies,
yes
your
honor.
there
are
provisions
in
the
statute
that
permit
the
waiving
of
fees.
we
may
in
some
of
these
cases
not
want
actually
copy
the
documents.
the
act
provides
for
two
means
of
access;
one
is
access
that
is
you
can
go
over
and
look
at
the
documents
and
inspect
them.
if
you
decide
you
want
them,
you
can
have
them
or
also
provides
for
copies
at
cost
and
there
are
provisions
of
waivers
for
cost
whether
we
would
want
all
the
documents
all
the
time
i
couldn't
say
your
honor
but
we
do
want
the
access
to
them
so
we
can
start
to
look
at
them
and
see
what's
really
in
them.
incidentally,
there
is
a
portion
of
one
of
these
swap
reports
which
is
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix
that
i
commend
to
your
examination.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
about
page
40
but
i'm
not
positive.
34
to
36.
so
based
upon
the
determination
by
the
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
a
copy
of
that
was
attached
to
the
affidavit
of
the
plaintiff
mr.
robertson.
he
obtained
a
copy
of
it
and
that
was
put
in
the
record
to
give
the
district
court
of
ideas.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
exactly
right
your
honor.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
was
not
counsel
at
the
time
that
was
put
in,
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
these
documents
your
honor
are
not
classified
in
the
sense
that
a
top
secret
document
be
classified
there
are
available
around
and
while
it's
on
the
understanding
between
the
agency
and
the
air
carrier
that
the
documents
are
not
to
be
--
are
not
generally
made
available
to
the
public
and
it's
so
stated
in
the
handbook
which
is
prepared
that
they
are
not
generally
made
available
to
the
public.
there
was
no
formal
ruling
and
indeed
the
specific
request
of
the
ata
in
this
case
to
hold
these
things
confidential.
belies
the
notion
that
it
was
a
generally
accepted
practice
that
even
that
not
withstanding
the
freedom
of
information
act,
it
could
be
withheld.
incidentally,
in
that
regard,
i
may
point
out
that
the
fact
that
a
particular
individual
may
have
expected
the
government
to
keep
the
document
confidential
is
of
course
no
defense
to
a
request
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
or
the
congress
is
overwritten
that
and
a
private
agreement
between
a
particular
individual
and
the
government
is
not
itself
a
reason
unless
the
document
otherwise
comes
within
one
of
the
exemptions
to
the
act.
based
upon
the
determination
by
the
faa
that
1104
applied
and
that
ought
to
be
invoked,
the
respondents
request
was
denied
and
based
upon
the
three
other
exemptions
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
respondent's
final
administrative
remedies
were
exhausted
and
this
action
thereafter
ensued.
the
district
court
rejected
all
of
the
defenses
are
raised
by
the
petitioners
and
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
solely
on
the
exemption
3
claim
and
therefore
that's
the
only
issue
we
have
before
this
court.
it
remanded
the
matter
for
further
proceedings
with
respect
to
the
other
defenses
raised
by
the
government.
exemption
3
permits
the
withholding
of
documents
which
are
in
the
language
of
that
provision
specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
by
statute
and
the
question
presented
is
are
the
swap
reports
specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
by
section
1104
as
the
petitioners
urge.
even
though
these
reports
are
not
mentioned
in
section
1104
and
the
basis
for
withholding
them
is
the
determination
by
the
head
of
the
faa
that
the
public
interest
does
not
require
their
disclosure.
we
suggest
that
if
the
position
of
the
government
is
a
date
adopted
here.
the
result
would
be
a
creation
of
a
wholesale
exception
the
freedom
of
information
act
for
these
two
agencies;
the
faa
for
safety
and
the
cab
for
economics.
they
could
simply
decide
for
themselves
where
the
public
interest
lies
and
hold
or
release
documents
accordingly
and
we
believed
that
that
was
not
congressional
intent.
moreover,
the
result
in
this
situation
that
the
government
urges
here
is
inconsistent
with
the
intent
in
congress
in
repealing
former
section
3
of
the
apa
and
enacting
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
result
that
the
plaintiffs
and
respondents
are
urging
in
this
case
is
supported
amply
by
an
examination
of
the
overall
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
the
freedom
of
information
act.
this
purpose
was
plainly
to
replace
the
vast
administrative
discretion
that
was
available
under
the
old
apa
section
3
to
withhold
and
which
ran
rapid
under
that
statute
so
that
as
this
court
said
in
mink
the
statute
became
more
of
a
withholding
of
then
a
disclosing
statute.
and
congress
decided
that
if
rather
than
the
agency
should
decide
what
documents
ought
to
be
disclosed
and
where
the
public
interest
lay
in
specific
situations
and
it
did
this
in
the
following
way.
it
said
that
all
documents
were
to
be
disclosed
except
for
those
specifically
exempted.
it
setup
nine
specific
exemptions
in
section
552(b).
now,
for
eight
of
these,
congress
that
wrote
the
freedom
of
information
act
in
1966
set
forth
those
standards
and
i
include
in
those
eight,
exemption
1
because
the
important
thing
about
exemption
1
is
although
it
made
reference
to
an
executive
order,
it
was
an
executive
order
which
permitted
withholding
only
in
the
interest
of
national
defense
or
foreign
policy
and
that
in
our
view
readily
distinguishes
it
from
the
kind
of
open-ended
statute
we
have
here.
it
makes
the
national
defense
standard
of
exemption
1
similar
to
other
kind
of
standards
that
are
set
forth
in
the
other
provisions
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
although,
in
fact
the
mechanism
for
bringing
it
about
or
somewhat
different
but
basically
there
is
a
congressional
imposition
of
a
standard
there
adjust
as
there
was
a
congressional
imposition
of
a
standard
regarding
the
other
substantive
exemptions.
now,
with
respect
to
the
last
exemption,
exemption
number
3,
the
one
we
have
before
this
court,
the
court
decided
that
--
the
congress
decided
that
rather
than
striking
a
new
balance
between
where
the
public
interest
lay
where
the
congress
had
previously
spoken,
it
decided
to
defer
to
the
judgment
of
prior
congresses
and
that
is
by
going
back
and
saying
we'll
continue
in
effect
prior
statutory
exemptions.
we
won't
second
guess
the
determination's
specific
judgments
made
by
the
prior
congress.
indeed
the
government's
reply
brief
in
this
court
said
that
what
congress
was
really
doing
was
that
it
decide
it
would
not
attempt
to
reexamine
or
distinguish
prior
legislative
judgments.
the
question
we
have
to
ask
here
is
“was
there
the
kind
of
legislative
judgment
in
section
1104
given
the
fact
that
it's
so
open
ended
with
both
respect
to
the
kind
of
documents
and
the
standards
for
disclosure?”
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
that
phrase
in
there.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
there
are
both
those
phrases
in
there
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
whatever
the
interest
is
of
the
requesting
party
and
your
honor
as
we
read
the
statute
indeed
even
another
faa
official
could
make
the
request
that
the
information
not
be
disclosed,
it
simply
says
any
person
may
make
a
request
and
there's
nothing
specifically
limited
in
that
but
confining
it
to
the
question
specifically
that
your
honor
as
we
view
the
adversely
effect
that
simply
as
another
side
of
the
same
public
interest
determination
that
really
once
someone
has
requested
that
a
document
be
made
available.
it
is
after
all
a
government
document
that
it
ought
in
the
general
course
to
be
made
available
as
being
in
the
public
interest,
the
public
to
know
what's
going
on
unless
there
is
some
kind
of
adverse
interest.
we
suggested
in
our
brief
at
footnote
seven
on
page
13
that
indeed
the
adversely
affected
standard
was
subsumed
in
as
part
of
the
same
public
interest
standard.
we
don't
understand
that
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it's
conjunctive
yes.
i
believe
we
must
find
that
it
is
adversely
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right.
i
understand
your
point.
i
think
i
adopt
it
and
do
so
vigorously
that
it
is
even
less
restrictive
standard
that
is
the
burden
is
almost
on
the
public
rather
than
on
the
withholding
rather
than
the
other
way
around.
we
don't
have
to
find
the
secrecies
required
as
the
old
apa
did
but
merely
that
the
public
interest
doesn't
require
that
the
document
be
released.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right
and
we
say
that
that's
all
really
partially
subsumed
in
the
same
standard.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
there
is
somebody
that
has
to
make
that
determination.
i
don't
know
whether
the
board
or
the
faa
could
do
it
on
their
own.
we
believe
it
could
indeed
in
the
cutler
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
your
honor.
it
did
not
hear,
that
is
correct,
at
least
as
far
as
the
record
discloses
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
he
could.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
more
importantly
your
honor,
for
the
purpose
of
freedom
of
information
act,
that
mechanic
would
--
may
well
be
protected
under
the
six
exemptions
which
prevent
clearly
unwanted
invasions
of
personal
privacy.
the
important
thing
about
1104,
its
not,
either,
or
nothing,
the
sole
defense
does
not
become
1104
nothing,
its
1104
or
whatever
else
ever
at
the
agency
has.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
correct.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right,
that's
precisely
our
position.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
except
your
honor
to
this
limited
area,
it
provides
a
mechanism
for
persons
who
wish
to
have
documents
that
are
otherwise
that
the
agency
might
release
if
it
chose.
for
instance,
in
this
mechanic's
report,
the
sixth
exemption
is
discretionary.
the
agency
need
not
withhold
documents
simply
because
it
might
withhold
the
document.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
think
we
can
go
make
it
a
broader
statute
and
that
your
honor
for
instance
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
let's
take
the
area
of
the
veterans'
administration
which
would
be
not
dissimilate.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
anybody
named
jones
or
mechanics
--
the
veterans'
administration
has
a
statute
titled
38,
section
3301
which
says
that,
“any
matter
relating
to
any
claim
of
a
veteran
under
this
chapter
maybe
with
--
shall
be
withheld
unless
one
of
the
following
conditions.”
no
question
in
our
mind
about
that.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right.
if
that's
what
the
statute
said,
we
don't
have
any
problems
with
that.
if
the
problem
here
is
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
exemption
3.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
because
exemption
3
uses
some
words
that
we
believe
are
fairly
narrow
words.
they're
not
the
clearest
words
that
i've
ever
seen
written,
i
couldn't
say
that
they
are
but
they
do
suggest
a
narrow
construction
specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
by
statue.
the
by
statute
was
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
the
general
legislative
history
does,
yes
your
honor.
we
don't
think
that
--
we
think
that
they
suggest
and
strongly
infer
that
it
is
the
statute
that
must
have
a
major
important
role
in
making
the
exemption
rather
than
the
administrator.
here
everything
is
on
the
administrator.
there
is
nothing
that
the
statute
commands
to
do
except
set
the
most
general
terms
of
the
exemption.
it
does
not
constitute
in
our
view
a
legislative
judgment.
congress
did
not
sit
down
and
say,
“well
now,
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
this
kind
of
problem.”
it
didn't
focus
in
as
it
did
on
for
instance
tax
returns
and
said,
“across
the
board,
tax
returns
shall
not
be
disclosed
except
in
certain
circumstances.”
we
think
that's
what
congress
did
with
the
other
exemptions
and
then
it
simply
in
the
third
exemption
adapted
prior
legislative
judgments
that
were
similar
in
kind
to
the
kind
it
was
making
in
1966
with
regard
to
all
of
the
exemptions
except
number
three.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right
and
that
i
think
your
honor
means
that
portions
of
documents
can
be
withheld
whereas
the
whole
--
the
entire
document
may
not
be
that's
as
i
interpret
it.
originally,
when
the
statute
was
written,
it
referred
to
particularize
records
of
the
statutes
were
rearrange
and
shuffled
around
but
i
don't
think
anyone
believes
that
there's
any
difference
between
the
particularize
records
that
could
be
withheld
and
the
matters
that
are
now
focused
on.
this
is
even
been
made
very
clear
in
the
recent
amendments
for
the
freedom
of
information
act
where
they
specifically
spell
out
that
certain
parts
of
documents
can
be
made
available
or
practice
which
had
been
followed
before
even
a
lot
of
parts
might
have
to
be
disclosed.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
it
might
your
honor
but
there
is
no
legislative
history
and
we've
gone
over
every
bit
of
it
that
we
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
would
say
this
your
honor,
there's
no
indication
that
any
place
in
the
congress,
anyone
focus
on
the
words
matters
as
oppose
to
documents,
or
particularized
records.
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
precise
focus
on
these
matters
as
we
suggest
there
was
no
focus
on
the
language
for
instance
comparing
the
first
exemption
or
the
third
exemption.
they
just
were
treated
differently
and
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
evidence
of
any
focus.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
would
say
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yeah,
that's
right
but
in
the
context
that
matters
in
general
might
but
in
the
context
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
where
we
are
after
our
only
talking
about
documents,
records
is
the
precise
term
of
the
act
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
we
don't
believe
it
was
repealed.
our
question
really
is
did
congress
intend
to
encompass
within
exemption
3
an
open-ended
statute
like
1104.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
was
thinking
about
that
before
it
came
here
today
and
the
answer
is
i
would
suggest,
yes,
your
honor.
the
answer
i
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
would
suppose
we
would
have
a
little
legislative
history
at
that
point
your
honor
and
i
think
it
probably
could
be
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
they
have
passed
statutes
that
have
in
some
respects,
restricted
access
to
documents
but
all
of
them
have
had
either
a
standard
as
to
the
type
of
documents
for
instance
the
transportation
board
statute
last
year
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
would
say
much
broader
than
that
your
honor,
it
says
“documents
connected
it
in
connection
with
the
safety
investigations
shall
not
be
disclosed
or
may
not
be
disclosed
except
in
certain
circumstances,
there
either
tell
us
what
kind
of
documents
we're
dealing
with.
they
are
at
some
sense
specific.
indeed
the
house
report
speaks
about
specific
records
which
are
withheld
by
these
statutes.
the
very
house
report
relied
on
by
the
government
and
we
suggest
that
--
that
at
least
suggest
that
in
this
exemption
that
congress
was
talking
about
specific
records
and
not
merely
the
kind
of
general
open-ended
application
to
any
document
in
the
files
of
the
cab
or
the
faa,
the
government
says,
“those
can
be
withheld
under
1104.”
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
your
honor,
i
can't
tell
you
when
it
was
because
i
don't
think
there
was
one.
there
is
a
1960
compilation
prepared
by
the
library
of
congress.
we
went
back
and
tallied
those
yesterday
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
that
was
referred
to
--
it
was
actually
put
into
a
legislative
formed
committee
print
of
the
house
of
representatives
in
1960.
but
that
particular
document
has
far
more
than
a
hundred
statutes
in
it.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
1938
and
then
it
was
re
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
reenacted
1958.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
correct.
it
was
the
civil
aeronautics
act
in
1938
and
then
1958
and
there
have
been
some
changes
in
codifications
but
essentially
1104
has
remain
practically
unchanged
and
for
these
purposes
unchanged
since
then.
in
the
1960
compilation
has
under
the
list
of
disclosure
discretionary
statute
that
has
79
national
security
disclosure
prohibited
26
and
the
general
confidentially,
68.
i
don't
know
what
that
total
is
up
to
but
that
is
far
more
than
a
hundred
and
i
might
also
point
out
your
honor
that
1104,
the
statute
relied
upon
by
the
government
is
not
in
that
list
of
a
hundred
in
any
place.
the
only
time
it
ever
appears
at
any
place
is
as
an
exhibit
to
a
1958
hearing
that
was
closed
before
the
exhibit
got
there
and
the
same
organization,
a
library
of
congress
which
prepared
that
exhibit
in
1958
also
prepared
this
document
here
two
years
later
and
didn't
include
it.
so
i
think
that
our
search
for
a
single
touch
down
is
bound
to
fail.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
no,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
necessarily
illogical
and
we
would
simply
say
your
honor
that
1104
doesn't
represent
the
kind
of
legislative
judgment
that
we
think
is
required
before
a
statute
comes
within
exemption
3.
after
all,
the
real
import
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
the
congress
was
taking
control
of
it
itself.
it
was
taking
it
away
from
the
administration.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
we
think
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
in
the
choice
of
how
they
do
it
your
honor
but
the
question
of
whether
congress
has
made
a
determination
as
to
what
lies
in
the
public
interest
in
terms
of
disclosure,
legislative
judgments
in
this
sense.
we
say
a
legislative
judgment
is
reflected
by
one
of
three
characteristics,
either
the
particular
document
is
to
be
withheld
as
described
in
the
legislation
tax
returns
for
example
or
congress
has
said
the
document
may
not
be
disclosed
as
it
said
for
tax
returns
certain
materials
from
the
cia
shall
not
be
disclosed,
atomic
energy
information.
or
third,
it
has
proscribed
substandard
under
which
the
administrator
may
exercise
its
discretion,
in
other
words,
we
view
it
as
a
kind
of
a
reduction
to
the
amount
of
delegation.
previously,
the
administrative
agencies
had
a
lot
of
delegation
and
we
think
congress
intended
very
narrowly
that
to
reduce
that
delegation
to
a
much
lower
level
than
it
previously
existed,
that's
why
we
believed
that
1104
which
is
far
broader
than
any
other
statute
does
not
apply
here.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
well,
i
don't
see
there's
anything
wrong
with
the
legislative
technique
in
drawing
--
in
drafting
1104
your
honor.
my
question
is
whether
congress
intended
to
bring
it
within
specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
by
statute
provisions
within
1104
or
whether
it's
simply
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
but
it
wasn't
by
the
statute
your
honor.
it
was
by
the
administrative
action
and
through
the
administrator
had
some
authority
from
the
statute
but
we
believe
that
that
wasn't
enough.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
1104
didn't
say
anything
about
that.
no,
no,
1104
is
the
statute
we're
trying
to
deal
within
the
context
of
exemption
3.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
yes,
it
was
1938
your
honor.
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
i
believe
it
was
slightly
--
the
phrases
where
slightly
modified
that
provision
about
national
defense
was
turned
around
a
little
bit
in
the
last
--
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
1104?
mr.
alan
b.
morrison
that's
right.
let
me
just
--
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
it
should
be
withheld
--
this
information
shall
withheld
from
public
disclosure
one
on
their
judgment,
that's
right.
that
is
the
phrase.
thank
you,
your
honor.
