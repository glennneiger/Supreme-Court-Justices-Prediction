doesn't
the
1104
though
rest
on
some
additional
finding
about
the
adverse
effect
upon
the
interest
of
private
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
that
the
public
interest
requires
that
--
that
the
public
interest
requires
it
to
be
remained
secret
but
that
the
public
interest
--
that
the
interest
and
is
not
required
--
disclosure
is
not
required
in
the
public
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
must
find
that
the
private
interest
would
be
adversely
effective.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
you
would
argue
that
the
board
doesn't
even
have
to
find
that
the
public
interest
requires
that
it
be
kept
secret
that
it's
a
much
even
a
lesser
standard
than
that
all
it
requires
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
well,
i
know
but
it
doesn't,
but
all
i
have
to
find
is
that
the
public
interest
doesn't
require
the
disclosure,
doesn't
have
to
find
that
the
public
interest
requires
a
nondisclosure.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
does
narrow
the
area
it
seems
to
me
of
--
in
terms
of
whether
it's
open-ended
or
not,
somebody
has
to
file
something
and
say
here
as
why
and
the
board
has
to
find
that
the
adversity
affects
interest
to
somebody.
now,
that
certainly
just
isn't
an
open-ended
invitation
to
the
agency.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
didn't
hear
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
gets
rather
the
example,
you
would
say
that
that
document
is
not
exempt
under
this
particular
exemption.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
despite
this
exemption,
despite
the
adverse
effect
on
it,
that
1104
just
has
no
application
whatsoever.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
has
been
in
effect
repealed.
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
ever
--
any
suggestion
of
legislative
history
that
any
of
these
statutes
such
as
1104
or
intended
to
be
repealed
that
might
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
argument
be
the
same
if
congress
today
pass
the
statute
like
1004?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
didn't
have
too
and
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
were
there
any
of
the
hundred
statutes
that
or
has
congress
pass
any
statutes
such
as
this
since
the
freedom
of
information
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
mechanics
type
document.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
compilation
of
a
hundred
statutes
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
was
it
ever
done
by
a
legislative
committee
or
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
federal
aviation
act
passed?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
reenacted?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
this
section
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
1104
within
existence
before
58?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
was
it
--
did
they
amend
it
in
58?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
say
these
documents
shall
be
exempt
from
public
disclosure.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
the
board
of
administrational
order,
the
information
withheld
from
public
disclosure.
