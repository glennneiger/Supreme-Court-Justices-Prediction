william
j.

would
any
citizen
have
the
same
right
to
bring
their
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
morrison,
coming
back
to
the
question
i
ask
you,
you
responded
that
any
citizen
would
have
the
same
right
to
sue,
let's
assume
you
win
this
case,
would
any
citizen
have
to
make
any
showing
to
be
entitled
to
the
documents
or
reports
that
you
desire
or
would
it
suffice
if
he
merely
wrote
a
letter
to
the
faa
and
said,
“please
put
me
on
your
mailing
list.
from
now
on,
i
want
every
one
of
these
reports;
otherwise,
i'm
going
to
sue.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
offering
to
pay
the
cost
yourself,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
for
example,
wasn't
1104,
i
suppose
one
of
the
swap
reports
spoke
disparagingly
of
a
particular
mechanic.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
name?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
was
1104
could
he
commend
and
ask
of
that
swap
report.
it
could
be
publish
because
he
says
that's
going
to
affect
me
personally.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
i
gather
the
board
has
to
make
the
further
inquiry
where
there
nevertheless
the
interest
of
the
public
would
require
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
well,
i
gather
what
you
say
that
if
you
have
something
which
would
protect
the
mechanic,
you
would
have
to
be
under
three
others
that
have
to
be
and
explicit
statute
which
said
and
no
swap
reports
that
involved
a
mechanic
and
may
adversely
affect
him
shall
be
published.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
much
broader?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
anybody
named
jones?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
matter
involving
any
mechanic.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
it's
like
that,
you
say
it
doesn't
come
within
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
within
exemption
3.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
if
they
are,
that
ambiguous
i
take
it
then
the
legislative
history
becomes
quite
important
does
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
were
certain
true
matters
has
boarder
connotation
for
the
document.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
literally.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
mr.
friedman
that's
really
that
if
the
subject
is
non
disclosure
no
matter
what
the
form
it
takes
that's
within
exemption
3.
