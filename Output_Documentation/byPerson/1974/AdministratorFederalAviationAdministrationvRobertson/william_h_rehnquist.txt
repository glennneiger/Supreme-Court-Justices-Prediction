justice
william
h.
rehnquist
prior
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
the
1966,
the
federal
aviation
administrator
could've
withheld
either
under
the
standard
of
the
old
freedom
of
information
act
or
under
the
1938
statute,
is
that
correct?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
were
two
changes
really
weren't
there
for
probably
more
than
that
but
one
was
to
do
a
way
with
the
so-called
standing
requirement.
you
had
to
show
an
interest
in
the
thing.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
second
was
to
do
a
way
with
the
general
right
of
--
in
a
government
official
to
say
the
public
interest
requires
this
to
be
classified
in
secret.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
right
to
appeal
at
on
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
your
quarrel
is
with
the
propriety
of
that
particular
determination
rather
than
with
the
fact
that
however
sound
that
determination,
it
can't
prevail
over
the
freedom
of
information
act.
i
should
think
your
remedy
would
be
by
appeal
of
that
determination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
nobody
promised
you
a
rose
garden.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
that
that's
protected
if
it
is
“specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
by
statute?”
its
not
documents
as
it
is
matters.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fact
that
the
phrase
is
matters
rather
than
documents
may
conceivably
shed
some
light
on
the
meaning
of
specifically
exempted
from
disclosure
by
statute
might
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
was
just
thinking
of
the
legislative
language
rather
than
the
legislative
history.
