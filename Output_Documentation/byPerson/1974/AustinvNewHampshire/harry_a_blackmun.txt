justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
smith,
before
you
get
in
to
that,
if
you
prevail
here
what
do
you
gain?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i’m
not
all
worried
about
the
first
--
about
the
question
standing,
but
aren’t
you
asking
whom
they
to
pay
the
same
tax
dollar
in
the
state
of
maine
rather
than
the
state
of
new
hampshire?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
therefore
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
say
the
legislative
decision
by
the
maine
legislature?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn’t
that
a
decision
that
the
maine
legislature
itself
has
made?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
hasn’t
the
maine
statute
in
effect
provided
and
recognized
the
propriety
of
this
payment
to
the
state
of
new
hampshire?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
i
guess
another
way
to
phrase
my
question
if
whether
this
isn’t
just
a
lawyer's
lawsuit?[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
taxpayers
may,
but
their
legislature
has
permitted
it
by
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
we
end
up
with
a
proposition
however
that
if
you
prevail
here
your
clients
are
out
the
same
amount
of
dollars?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
maine
legislature,
if
it
chooses
to
do
that
can
change
its
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
a
routine
that
has
to
go
over
the
country?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
that
respect
mr.
smith,
suppose
that
maine
didn’t
have
an
income
tax
at
all,
would
that
mean
that
new
hampshire
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
smith,
you
--
does
the
record
show
how
much
we
are
really
talking
about
in
dollars
in
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
smith,
you’re
familiar
with
the
federal
state
tax
system,
aren’t
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
under
the
federal
state
tax
system,
there
is
or
at
least
used
to
be
a
credit
for
state
inheritance,
some
estate
taxes
paid
in
many
states
because
their
inheritance
tax
would
not
eat
up
the
20%
credit
as
to
an
estate
tax
to
take
up
the
slack
and
i
guess
i’m
asking
whether
that
doesn’t
afford
a
precedent
to
precisely
what
new
hampshire
is
doing
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
i
come
back
then
--
isn’t
part
of
your
answer
that
this
is
a
political
question
which
the
maine
legislature
has
resolved?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
should
i
suggest
mr.
cleaveland
that
two
government
employees
in
this
city
earning
$20,000.00
a
piece,
one
leaving
in
maryland
and
one
in
virginia
might
have
different
income
tax
obligations.
