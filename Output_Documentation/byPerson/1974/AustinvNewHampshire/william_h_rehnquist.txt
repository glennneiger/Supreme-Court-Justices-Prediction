justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
their
legislature
too
might
feel
that
even
though
they
could
exact
full
measure
of
the
maine
tax,
there
would
be
an
element
of
unfairness
in
the
eyes
of
that
legislature
to
this
particular
solution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
statement
then
as
to
the
effect
to
that
purported
tax
on
new
hampshire
residents
earning
income
out
of
the
state
that
it
simply
categorically
doesn’t
effect
a
single
person
in
that
class?
it’s
really
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
gimmick
in
other
words.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
non-resident
coming
from
a
state
which
imposes
no
income
tax
would
pay
no
new
hampshire
income
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
high
one.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
privileges
and
immunities
argument
would
stand
or
wouldn’t
it
even
though
all
non-residents
were
treated
alike
simply
because
of
the
difference
in
treatment
between
non-residents
and
residents?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cleaveland.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
court
certainly
has
gone
a
long
way
in
saying
that
you
can’t
be
absolutely
equal
and
that
some
differences
will
be
tolerated
in
the
sort
of
thing.
but
is
there
any
single
resident
of
new
hampshire
that
whether
--
you
know
an
existence
that
would
pay
a
tax
as
a
result
of
that
provision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
can
go
back
to
madison’s
notes
in
the
debates
in
the
constitutional
convention
in
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
find
that
that
is
just
a
sort
of
thing
they
had
in
mind
that
they
didn’t
want
the
states
to
be
doing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
case
in
toomer
against
witsell
where
south
carolina
was
charging
a
fee
that
to
non-residents,
would
it
have
been
a
sufficient
answer
there
to
tell
this
man
that
if
he
done
a
shrimping
in
north
carolina
waters
if
that
was
where
he
lived,
he
would
have
had
to
pay
a
fee
which
north
carolina
charged,
so
he
really
wasn’t
injured?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
that’s
on
the
merits,
not
on
the
standing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
can
be
seriously
maintained
that
the
new
hampshire
$10.00
residency
tax
or
whatever
else
new
hampshire
residents
pay
is
really
an
approximate
equivalent
of
what
the
other
state
people
pay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
make
that
argument
here
that
there
is
rough
equality?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
--
new
hampshire
really
borders
on
three
states,
doesn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maine,
vermont
and
massachusetts,
do
all
of
those
have
income
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
people
who
do
not
reside
in
those
three
states
may
work
in
new
hampshire?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
you’d
be
in
much
tougher
shape
to
sustain
your
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
privileges
and
immunities?
