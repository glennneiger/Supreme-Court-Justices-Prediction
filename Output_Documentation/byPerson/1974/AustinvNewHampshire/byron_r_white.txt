white
privileges
and
immunities
would
reach
only
the
discrimination
you
say
on
residents
and
non-residents?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
other
is
an
equal
protection
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
heart
of
your
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
maine
law
would
be
acceptable
politically
or
constitutionally
or
any
other
way
if
it
said
we
allow
credits
for
all
the
payments,
all
income
tax
payments
made
in
other
states
except
vermont
--
except
new
hampshire?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
if
that
isn’t
acceptable
than
the
legislative
solution
requires
denying
that
is
to
everybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don’t
you
do
it
to
all
out
of
state
residents
who
work
in
new
hampshire?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
if
they
don’t
have
an
income
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
aren’t
trying
to
tax
out
of
staters
for
equivalently
with
in
staters
because
you
just
don’t
tax
a
lot
of
out
of
staters?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
it
didn’t
give
a
credit?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
--
correct
or
fill
me
in,
assume
--
what
is
the
tax
rate
here,
4%?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
will
never
be
higher?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
takes
his
money
until
the
end
of
the
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
at
least
it
deprives
him
of
the
use
of
the
money
during
the
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
stolen
by
the
state
of
maine
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
in
fact
some
non-resident
(inaudible)
if
they
work
in
vermont
--
they
in
new
hampshire?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yeah
but
if
it
has
some
relevance
to
your
argument
at
all,
all
you
are
trying
to
do
is
to
equalize
the
overall
tax
burden
between
residents
of
new
hampshire
and
non-residents
of
new
hampshire.
if
you’re
trying
to
do
that,
you
tax
non-residents
in
the
same
way?
