justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand
mr.
smith,
if
new
hampshire
did
tax
its
own
residents
at
this
4%
rate
of
their
income,
then
you
would
have
no
constitutional
case
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
with
respect
to
non-residents,
there
would
still
be
the
same
unequal
incident?
justice
potter
stewart
--
depending
upon
whether
they
live
in
vermont,
massachusetts
or
maine?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you’ll
have
no
case
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
but
even
if
they
weren’t
--
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
not
the
situation,
but
i’m
trying
to
see
what
your
constitutional
attack
is?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you’re
treating
--
assume
there
were
a
4%
tax
on
residents?
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
i
know
there
is
not
but
let’s
assume
there
is
and
also
a
4%
tax
on
non-residents
commuters
to
come
to
new
hampshire
to
work,
but
were
the
same
provisions
as
still
now
exist,
that
would
mean
some
non-residents
would
get
a
better
break
than
others?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
wouldn’t
have
the
same
constitutional
attack
you
now
have,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
but
none
of
them
would
be
taxed
higher
than
would
be
residents
of
new
hampshire?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
at
least
a
not
so
strong
an
attack
as
you
now
has?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
other
words,
if
the
tax
structure
of
vermont,
massachusetts
and
maine
were
precisely
the
same
so
that
the
effect
was
precisely
the
same
on
all
non-residents,
nonetheless,
you’d
have
a
privilege
and
immunities
attacked
because
there’s
no
tax
at
all
on
new
hampshire?
justice
potter
stewart
you
didn’t
get
any
interest
in
this?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it’s
not
like
that
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
that
extent
you
are
making
that
basic
argument
mr.
cleaveland,
you
are
telling
us
in
effect
that
the
supreme
court
of
new
hampshire
was
wrong
in
finding
standing
because
that’s
the
traditional
and
most
elementary
test
of
standing
as
was
the
plaintiff
injured
and
you
said
no
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff
is
not
injured.
no
injury
in
fact
and
that’s
--
if
there
is
no
injury
in
fact,
then
the
plaintiff
is
without
standing
and
to
that
extent
your
supreme
court
was
mistaken,
that
must
be
what
you’re
telling
us?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
to
get
business
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
true
that
as
you
know
if
you
are
not
sure
in
our
cases
that
often
a
state
court
will
say
under
state
law,
you
have
standing
and
this
court
will
say
well,
you
don’t
have
standing
from
our
position
and
vice
versa?
justice
potter
stewart
could
it
be
the
different
country,
some
could
come
from
canada
presumably
which
is
--
and
might
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
as
my
brother
brennan
suggests
undoubtedly
there
are
good
many
people
who
have
summer
jobs
in
new
hampshire
from
other
states
other
than
the
border
states?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that
no
part
of
your
brother's
case,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
real
point
is
that
the
new
hampshire
resident
working
right
along
side
making
the
same
income
doesn’t
pay
anything
and
that’s
what
make
this
unlike
the
maine
tax
on
non-resident,
new
hampshire
rights
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
maine
imposes
a
tax
on
its
own
people?
