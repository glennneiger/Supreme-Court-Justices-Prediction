justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
as
i
understand
it,
new
hampshire
withholds
at
the
rate
of
4%?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
that
the
maine
tax
has
been
3%,
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
at
times
itâ€™s
less
than
the
4%?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
would
you
concede
that
there
is
an
injury
where
the
maine
resident
is
--
having
his
taxes
withheld
in
an
amount
in
excess
of
what
he
might
ultimately
have
paid
in
there?
