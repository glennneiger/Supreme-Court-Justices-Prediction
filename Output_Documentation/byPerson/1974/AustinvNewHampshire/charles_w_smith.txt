mr.
charles
w.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
out
of
a
petition
for
a
declaratory
judgment
brought
by
a
three
maine
citizens
and
residents
against
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
the
taxing
authorities
of
that
state,
questioning
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
so-called
commuters
income
tax
in
that
state,
both
and
the
--
they
say
--
said
it
was
a
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
provisions
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
it
was
reported
as
a
--
what
they
call
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
a
reserved
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
and
that
court
found
that
the
petitioners
had
standing
that
the
vehicle
for
getting
there,
the
declaratory
judgment
method
was
a
proper
vehicle,
but
denied
the
relief
requested
and
as
a
result,
it
comes
before
this
court
on
appeal
from
that
decision.
there
are
two
constitutional
issues
which
are
raised
in
the
case,
one
is
that
the
new
hampshire
statute
is
violative
of
the
privileges
and
immunity
clause
of
article
4,
section
2
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
equal
protection
clause
in
that
amendment.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
if
we
prevail
here,
i
presume
that
what
our
people
gain
is
the
payment
of
tax
in
their
own
state.
we
get
to
a
question
i
think
that
you’re
raising,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
of
standing
which
is
a
corollary
issue
in
this
case
which
i’ll
come
to
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
yes,
but
we’re
asking
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
--
that
they
pay
the
same
tax
dollar
to
the
state
of
maine
rather
than
the
state
of
new
hampshire
because
they
would
get
the
benefits
of
the
payment
of
that
tax
dollar
in
the
state
of
maine
that
they
do
not
get
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
would
you
repeat
the
question,
may
it
please
the
court,
so
that
i’ll
understand
it.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
i
do
not
believe
that
that’s
a
question
of
the
maine
legislature
and
i
think
we
get
into
what
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
was
designed
to
prevent,
we
get
into
what
we
call
retaliatory
legislation.
if
one
states
tax
to
retaliate
against
another
state
because
of
the
taxing
statutes
to
that
particular
state,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
i
do
not
believe
that
the
maine
statute
or
the
legislature
has
recognized
the
propriety
of
the
payment
in
new
hampshire.
simply
the
maine
statute
as
most
income
tax
statutes,
most
state
income
tax
statutes
gives
a
credit,
may
it
please
the
court,
to
taxes
paid
in
--
on
income
and
other
jurisdictions
in
the
state
of
maine,
they
give
it
against
the
maine
tax
and
that
is
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
it’s
a
credit
against
the
tax.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
no,
i
think
these
people
feel
very
strongly
about
this
and
this
is
why
we
are
in
this
court.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
their
legislature,
i
am
sure
their
legislature
could
change
it
by
doing
a
way
with
the
credit
and
then
we
get
in
to
all
the
retaliatory
legislative
processes
against
one
state
against
another
which
this
court
has
said,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
was
designed
to
prevent.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
i’m
suppose
--
i
presume
that
that’s
the
excessive
reasoning
or
rational
behind
it,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
get
to
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
they’re
out
the
same
amount
of
dollars
but
they’re
going
to
have
those
amounts
of
dollars
spent
in
their
state
under
the
provisions
of
this
statute
where
they
receive
the
benefits
of
those
amounts
of
dollars
spent.
either
in
--
by
a
way
of
reduction
of
taxation
in
their
state
because
of
an
additional
amount
of
income
in
their
state
or
by
the
benefit
of
the
services
that
they
can
receive.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
if
it
changes
its
statute,
it’s
that
--
it
could
stay
--
it
could
simply
do
a
way
with
the
credit.
and
then
of
course
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
pointed
out,
it
would
impose
an
additional
burden
on
all
of
the
maine
taxpayers
that
are
working
out
of
that
state
and
again
having
income
tax
imposed
--
in
other
words
they’d
be
double
--
subject
to
double
taxation
which
now
have
failed.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
we
have
double
taxation,
i
will
agree
to
that,
but
i
think
that
that
would
be
one
of
the
impositions
that
results.
the
state
of
new
hampshire
has
raised
before
this
court
the
question
of
standing
and
we
would
say
that
we
answer
that
very
simply,
we
advanced
it
in
our
brief
but
we
say
that
this
is
the
case
of
a
taxpayer
which
is
questioning
the
imposition
of
a
tax
or
question
the
statute
which
imposes
a
tax
upon
the
taxpayer
and
not
to
question
that
is
so
often
come
before
this
court
of
a
taxpayer
questioning
the
spending
of
taxpayer’s
funds
and
we
submit
that
that
is
quite
a
difference.
we
feel
that
the
taxpayer
always
has
a
right
to
challenge
the
constitutional
validity
of
a
statute
under
which
he
is
taxed.
and
we
think
that
we
have
precedent
in
this
court.
in
the
allied
stores
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
which
was
an
ohio
case
which
is
similar
in
almost
all
respects
except
that
that
was
not
an
income
tax,
it
was
an
ad
velorem
tax
in
that
case
and
the
very
question
i
think
that
was
raised
a
moment
ago
here
by
the
court
was
decided
in
that
case.
that
was
a
case
where
allied
stores
of
ohio
was
a
resident
corporation
and
they
were
taxed
on
merchandise
and
storage
under
the
provisions
of
the
ohio
statute,
merchandise
that
were
kept
in
storage
by
non-residents
that
were
not
taxed,
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
they
brought
it
to
this
court.
they
brought
it
to
this
court
after
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
ohio
had
denied
standing
saying
that
it
didn’t
make
any
difference
to
the
taxpayer
in
that
case
that
if
they
struck
out
that
proviso
as
to
the
non-resident
proviso
that
nevertheless
they
would
be
subject
to
the
same
amount
of
tax
and
this
court
said
that
they
had
standing
to
raise
the
issue
and
then
went
on
and
decided
the
constitutional
issues
in
the
case.
we
say
that
we
are
in
exactly
at
the
same
standing.
we
say
also
that
we
have
a
--
was
subject
to
injury
under
the
statute
because
the
petitioners
here,
the
appellants
in
this
case
as
i
have
pointed
out
would
get
the
benefit
of
their
tax
dollar
in
the
state
of
maine
or
reduction
of
taxes
in
the
state
of
maine
if
their
tax
dollar
was
retained
by
that
state.
i
think
we
have
to
understand
the
background
of
standing
as
we
are
talking
about
it,
we
have
to
understand
something
about
the
new
hampshire
statute.
the
new
hampshire
statute
does
not
tax
the
income
of
the
residents
of
new
hampshire
in
that
state.
it
pretends
to
tax
the
income
of
new
hampshire
residents
working
in
another
state,
but
i
say,
i
use
the
word
pretend
because
they
make
two
exemptions
which
literally
destroys
the
taxation
provision
because
they
make
the
first
exemption
that
if
the
other
state
imposes
a
tax,
then
that
new
hampshire
resident
is
not
subject
to
a
income
tax
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
and
if
the
other
state
does
not
impose
a
tax
on
income,
then
likewise,
the
new
hampshire
resident
is
not
subject
to
a
tax
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
so
that
under
no
conceivable
condition
can
a
new
hampshire
resident
be
taxed
on
his
income
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
this
tax
is
only
imposed,
this
income
tax
is
only
imposed
against
non-residents.
it's
a
flat
4%
tax
in
excess
for
the
first
$2,000.00
of
income
or
stated
in
other
way,
the
$2,000.00
exempt
and
it’s
a
flat
4%,
then
they
adjust
the
tax.
they
say
that
if
in
the
state
of
none
resident,
the
tax
would
be
less
--
lesser,
then
they
impose
the
lesser
tax.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
they
would
pay
no
tax
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
they
would
pay
no
tax.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
theoretically
under
the
law,
they
would
pay
a
tax,
but
they
would
get
it
back,
but
that’s
not
the
way
they
work
in
practical
effect
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
they
pay
no
tax
if
they
--
if
maine
had
no
income
tax
in
the
state
of
maine,
they
would
--
there
would
be
no
income
tax
imposed.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
i
would
have
to
make
that
categorical
statement,
i
can’t
conceive
of
any
condition.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
it’s
a
sham,
it’s
exactly
what
i
say,
i
said
it
was
a
pretends
but
that’s
exactly
what
i
say.
i
can’t
conceive
of
any
condition
where
a
new
hampshire
resident
working
out
of
state
is
going
to
be
taxed
on
his
income
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
no
possible
way.
and
it
is
because
of
this
credit
and
because
of
the
--
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire
says,
if
the
petitioners
do
not
have
standing,
i
think
i’ve
covered
that
fairly
well
as
i
go
along
here
both
from
the
point
of
view
of
prior
pronouncements
of
this
court
and
of
the
pocketbook
issue.
i
would
point
out
one
other
thing
that
as
the
result
of
this
new
hampshire
statute,
non-residents
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
working
in
new
hampshire
of
course
are
subject
to
criminal
penalties
under
the
income
tax
law
whereas
the
residents
of
new
hampshire
are
not
subject
to
any
penalties
at
all
in
this
respect.
they
raise
one
other
question
which
it’s
a
corollary
issue
and
i
think
that
i
should
address
just
a
moment
of
my
time
to
that.
and
that
is
that
we
have
no
overcome
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
of
the
taxing
statute
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
we
say
that
that
presumption
disappears,
recognizing
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
constitutionality,
we
say
that
that
presumption
disappears.
first
of
all
because
this
court
has
said
in
the
mullaney
case
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
mere
imposition
of
the
tax
does
not
constitute
that
the
statute
is
a
valid
statute.
and
secondly,
because
of
what
this
court
said
in
the
case
of
bailey
versus
drexel
furniture
company,
that’s
a
case
not
cited
in
my
brief
and
i
timely
gave
this
case
to
counsel
for
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
found
in
259
us
20
which
was
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
259
us
20,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
this
was
a
case
of
a
child
labor
tax
and
it
was
a
federal
statute
rather
than
a
state
statute
that
was
in
question
and
this
court
said
but
i
say
that
that
--
i
cannot
say
that
that
makes
any
difference,
and
this
court
said,
the
presumption
of
validity
cannot
prevail
because
proof
of
the
contrary
is
found
on
the
very
face
of
its
provisions.
in
other
words,
in
that
case
they
said,
on
the
face
of
that
statute
itself,
it
is
unconstitutional
on
the
face
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
and
therefore,
it
cannot
prevail.
getting
down
to
the
matter
of
the
constitutional
invalidity
and
the
two
questions
that
i
mentioned,
the
two
issues
that
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
i
think
that
the
state
of
new
hampshire,
the
appellees
in
this
case,
misread
the
case
of
shaffer
versus
carter
on
which
they
seem
to
bottom
their
argument
that
their
tax
is
within
constitutional
limits.
in
that
case,
there
was
two
cases
decided
at
the
same
term
to
this
court,
that
case
and
the
travis
versus
yale
&
towne
manufacturing
company
case,
and
in
that
case,
which
was
an
oklahoma
case,
it
established
only
that
a
state
might
impose
an
income
tax
on
non-residents,
that
was
the
thrust
of
--
main
thrust
to
that
case.
but
in
that
case,
oklahoma
also
had
an
income
tax
against
its
residents,
and
the
burden
was
not
more
onerous
on
non-residents
than
it
was
upon
residents
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
complete
thrust
to
that
case
as
i
have
read
it.
they
went
in
to
some
other
matters
but
i
think
that’s
the
thrust
of
it
because
at
the
same
time
with
that
court,
we
came
down
with
the
case
of
travis
versus
yale
&
towne
manufacturing
company
which
was
the
new
york
statute
was
in
question
and
i’m
sure
this
court
is
familiar
with
the
case
decided
in
our
brief,
where
non-residents
were
not
granted
the
same
exemption
as
residents.
and
in
that
case
they
said
that
there
was
not
--
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
united
states
that
they
were
not
granted,
non-residents
working
in
that
state
were
not
granted
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
yale
&
towne,
were
not
granted
the
same
privileges
as
the
taxpayer
in
the
state
of
new
york,
the
resident
taxpayer
in
the
state
of
new
york.
this
statute
is
not
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
sure.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
new
hampshire
doesn’t
have
a
tax,
so
that
new
hampshire
residents
could
not
to
any
conditions
may
be
subject
to
a
tax.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
yes,
i’m
sorry.
i
--
new
hampshire
does
not
impose
a
tax
upon
its
residents
of
any
kind
and
therefore
there
could
be
no
criminal
penalties
against
any
resident
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
i
say
that
that
only
goes,
i
have
only
pointing
that
out
on
the
question
standing,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
didn’t
go
to
constitutional
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
i
presume
that
it
does,
but
i’m
not
a
--
i
have
to
tell
you
sir
that
i’m
not
a
constitutional
lawyer,
but
i
would
suspect
that
it
would
offend
both
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
we
say
so.
this
is
our
argument,
may
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
--
because
first
of
all,
it
doesn’t
--
it’s
--
we
have
to
say
it’s
completely
arbitrary
as
to
its
classifications
and
that
the
--
has
no
fair
or
substantial
relationship
to
the
object
of
the
legislation.
this
is
not
by
the
way
a
statute
which
has
dedicated
revenues.
it
is
not
a
statute
which
says
that
non-residents
working
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
constitute
some
peculiar
or
particular
source
of
evil
as
was
talked
about
in
the
toomer
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
it
just
goes
in,
the
money
just
go
into
the
general
fund
of
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
they
try
to
justify
this
at
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
by
saying
that
its
practical
effect
is
offset
because
they
do
have
a
tax
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
which
non-residents
do
not
participate
in
on
an
income
over
the
sum
of
$600.00,
but
many
states
have
that
same
kind
of
a
tax
and
the
reason
that
they
do
not
tax
non-residents
in
that
kind
of
a
--
of
that
time
with
the
tax
scheme
would
be
that
you
would
dry
up
capital
in
that
particular
state
of
falling
into
the
state
of
new
hampshire
and
i’m
sure
that
that
can’t
offset
in
any
respect
the
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
no,
it
does
not.
the
amicus
curiae
brief
filed
by
the
state
of
maine
and
the
state
of
vermont
indicates
that
we’re
talking
in
--
as
far
as
the
state
of
maine
is
concerned
in
the
neighborhood
for
that
year
from
1970,
because
this
is
the
first
year
of
the
law
immediately
attacked,
of
$400.00
--
$400,000.00
may
it
please
the
court
for
that
particular
year.
what
it
is
at
the
current
time,
i
do
not
know.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
maine
loses
that
amount
of
money.
now,
my
only
authority
for
that
is
in
the
amicus
curiae
brief
which
is
filed
in
this
court.
now,
there
is
one
other
peculiar
feature
about
this
law
that
i
want
to
point
out,
we
pointed
it
out
in
the
brief,
but
i’d
like
to
discuss
it
for
just
a
moment.
and
that
is
that
it
treats
non-resident’s
unequal
because
of
this
tax
credit.
in
other
words,
the
state
of
maine
and
the
state
of
vermont
and
the
non-residents
of
the
state
of
massachusetts,
all
working
at
the
same
job
contribute
because
of
their
own
state
statute,
taxing
statute
contribute
in
different
sums
of
money
although
they
might
have
the
same
job,
the
same
income,
the
same
amount
of
exemptions
and
dependence,
they
would
all
be
treated
differently.
in
fact
the
non-residents
coming
from
a
state
which
imposes
no
income
tax
would
pay
no
income
tax
in
that
state
of
new
hampshire
at
all,
although
he’s
working
at
the
same
job,
getting
the
same
income
in
the
state
of
new
hampshire
as
other
non-residents.
so
that
it
treats
among
non-residents,
it
treats
them
unequally
and
unfairly.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
that
is
correct,
may
it
please
the
court,
no
new
hampshire
income
tax
at
all.
the
state
of
massachusetts
as
a
matter
of
fact
would
pay
a
far
greater
tax
because
of
the
taxing
structure
than
the
state
of
--
the
resident
of
state
of
maine.
we’ve
set
forth
some
illustrations
in
our
brief,
but
it
doesn’t
even
treat
the
class.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
the
vermont
pays
a
different
tax
and
i’ve
forgotten
what
--
whether
it’s
more
or
less.
i
think
it’s
more
than
the
state
of
maine
because
i
think
their
tax
rate
is
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
yes,
vermont
does
have
an
income
tax.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
very
high,
they
--
fairly
high
tax
and
i’m
sure
that
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
so
they
would
pay
a
tax
that’s
even
higher
than
the
state
of
maine
but
it
preach
that
the
point
is,
that
it
treats
all
of
this
classification
of
non-residents
unequally
that
the
taxing
structure
itself
which
again
we
say
is
violative
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
united
states
and
again
it’s
violative
also
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
i
don’t
think
that
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
we
would
have
no
constitutional
case,
we
wouldn’t
be
here
-
mr.
charles
w.
smith
well,
i’m
not
sure
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
i
think
perhaps
--
i
--
if
all
of
the
--
yes,
i
have
to
withdraw
what
i
said.
i
think
we’d
still
have
a
constitutional
imperfection
among
non-residents
in
that
respect,
although
new
hampshire
residents
was
taxed,
but
we
do
not
quibble
here
that
if
all
non-residents
and
all
residents
were
taxed
alike
that
we
have
no
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
we’ll
have
no
case
at
all
but
that’s
not
in
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
that’s
not
our
forum.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
my
thought
would
be
yes,
my
thought
would
be
because
you
are
still
using
non-residents
--
treating
non-residents
unequally.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
residents,
right.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
i
think
under
that
posture,
i
think
we
would
because
non-residents,
if
it
just
fell
on
--
an
occasional
burden
fell
on
some
taxpayer,
on
the
single
taxpayer,
then
we
perhaps
would
have
no
constitutional
question.
but
here
we
have
a
classification
of
taxpayers,
so
that
you
have
within
your
subclasses
that
you
have
an
unequal
treatment
and
i
think
that
would
be
violative,
certainly
violative
of
the
--
you’re
taxing
the
brown-eyed
people
at
one
tax
and
you’re
taxing
the
blue-eyed
people
at
another
tax,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
no,
but
that
wouldn’t
affect
in
my
constitutional
infirmity
of
the
tax
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
we
wouldn’t
have
a
stronger
attack
that
we
now
have.
we
have
--
we
think
the
very
strong
attack
at
this
time,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
that
is
correct,
may
it
please
the
court.
that
--
i
think
this
court
has
spoken
several
times
that
just
residency
alone,
the
citizenship
alone
as
this
court
has
said
in
these
cases
is
not
a
--
is
an
arbitrary
classification
and
this
is
something
more
unless
--
unless
that
group
constitutes
some
particular
or
peculiar
source
of
evil
to
the
--
which
the
statute
is
designed
to
correct,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
that
is
correct.
yes
mr.
charles
w.
smith
the
other
is
equal
protection
clause
which
will
--
which
only
state
residents
can
take
advantage
but
non-residents
can
also
take
advantage
off,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
that
is
correct,
that’s
right.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
that’s
the
heart
of
our
case,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
i
am
not
a
state
tax
lawyer,
we
have
other
people
in
our
firm
to
do
that.
i’m
familiar
with
it
generally
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
well,
i’m
not
sure.
there
have
been
some
decisions
by
this
court
and
i’m
not
familiar
with
all
of
them.
i’m
not
sure
that
that
would
be
precisely
the
same
question
that
we
have
here.
i
--
it
sounds
to
me
as
you
expound
the
question
that
it
would
be
the
same,
but
i’m
not
sure
that
in
the
--
mr.
charles
w.
smith
i
don’t
think
there
would
be
in
that
case.
you
have
there
the
--
at
most
an
equal
protection
violation.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
you
might
have
due
process,
right.
i
have
nothing
further,
may
it
please
the
court,
unless
there
some
questions,
thank
you.
mr.
charles
w.
smith
i
think,
unless
the
court
has
some
questions
to
address
me,
then
we
don’t
have
any
rebuttal.
