e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-2060,
austin
against
new
hampshire.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
do
so
and
of
course
you'll
serve
it
in
the
usual
course
on
your
friend.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
we’ll
wait
for
a
moment
counsel.
we’ll
wait
for
a
moment
until
the
room
gets
a
little
quiet
here.
i
think
perhaps
we
can
proceed
now,
mr.
smith
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
back
--
let
me
back
up
a
little
bit
mr.
smith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you,
at
least
i
thought
you’ve
said
earlier
that
maine
residents
are
subject
to
criminal
penalties
in
new
hampshire
if
they
work
there
and
don’t
pay
their
taxes,
but
that
for
the
non-payment
of
the
same
kind
of
a
tax
by
a
new
hampshire
men
in
new
hampshire
is
only
subject
to
civil
penalties?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
i
did
misunderstand
you.
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
as
to
that
point,
what
provision
of
the
constitution
do
you
say
that
offense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
think
it
offends
any
other
provisions
of
the
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
we
know
the
case,
it's
usually
a
constitutional
lawyer
who’s
set
up
something
to
persuade
us
to
hear
it,
but
to
pursue
that
a
moment,
the
equal
protection
clause
is
at
least
one
of
the
candidates
that
might
be
violated
by
this
provision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
new
hampshire?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
maine
loses
that
amount
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright,
you
may
save
your
remaining
time
for
rebuttal
mr.
smith.
mr.
cleaveland.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
there
at
1
o’clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
continue
mr.
cleaveland.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
deprivation
from
injury,
you
regard
then
as
two
different
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
there’s
the
additional
injury
that
your
friend
mentioned
that
there’s
money
going
out
of
maine
and
into
new
hampshire
which
never
comes
back
to
the
state
of
maine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
who
is
the
state
of
maine
except
all
the
people
in
the
state
of
maine,
particularly
among
the
taxpayers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
fact
that
it’s
a
revolving
fund
and
it’s
a
circular
process
doesn’t
alter
all
of
the
fact
that
it
goes
out
to
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
smith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
73-2060,
austin
against
new
hampshire
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
