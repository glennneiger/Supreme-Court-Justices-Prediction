justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
you
didn't
collect
from
the
non-residents,
it's
the
residents
that
pays
up,
wouldn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
did
you
get
the
$400,000.00
that
now
you
getting
the
maine
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
you
said
that
it
wouldn’t
change
the
new
hampshire
people,
i
submit
it
would.
they’d
had
to
raise
their
tax
from
new
hampshire
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
the
taxpayers
--
that’s
political
move
you
can
make
it
to
tax
somebody
else
other
than
people
that
vote
for
you?[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
cleaveland,
do
you
have
any
situation
where
two
people
making
$20,000.00
a
year
are
taxed
on
a
different
percentage
basis
other
than
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
situation
in
the
world
like
that,
where
two
people
doing
exact
same
job,
getting
exact
same
money
are
taxed
differently?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
anyone
where
two
people
doing
the
exact
same
work,
in
exact
same
place
with
the
exact
same
money
are
taxed
differently?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
assessed
by
two
different
agencies.
but
i
want
to
know
where
the
taxing
authority,
a
single
tax
of
authority,
taxes
two
people
making
exact
the
same
money
at
different
rate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
they
both
earning
20,000?
justice
thurgood
marshall
sure.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
not
the
basic
tax,
the
basic
tax
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
this
is
unique,
isn't
it?
i’m
not
saying
it’s
unconstitutional
but
at
least
unique.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
no
more
unique
than
taxing
everybody
but
the
resident,
it’s
no
more
unique.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case,
the
appellants,
residents
of
maine
have
challenged
a
new
hampshire
commuters
income
tax
under
which
their
income
earned
in
new
hampshire
is
taxed
while
the
earned
income
of
new
hampshire
residents
no
matter
where
earned
are
not
taxed.
a
prior
decision
of
this
court
established
that
in
the
area
of
taxation,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
article
iv
of
the
constitution
required
that
non-residents
be
treated
on
terms
of
substantial
equality
with
residents.
the
actual
effect
of
the
new
hampshire
commuters
tax
however,
if
exact
from
the
non-residents
the
wholly
disproportionate
share
of
the
costs
of
government.
therefore,
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
the
tax
statute
unconstitutional
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
douglas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
