mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
if
i
may,
i
do
not
have
reply
argument,
but
mr.
roddick
advised
me
that
i
should
speak
to
you
concerning
our
reply
brief
because
this
case
was
accelerated,
we
would
request
permission
to
file
our
reply
brief
following
argument.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
certainly,
thank
you.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
our
view,
this
case
does
not
involve
any
novel
issues
of
constitutional
law,
although
it
maybe
said
to
raise
some
familiar
principles
in
a
new
configuration.
it’s
my
objective
here
today
to
demonstrate
that
this
new
configuration
is
not
an
occasion
for
this
court
to
depart
from
those
familiar
principles
and
that
a
logical
application
of
these
principles
compels
a
conclusion
that
the
decision
of
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed.
now,
the
principal
contention
which
we
urge
upon
this
court
and
have
set
out
in
the
brief
is
that
the
appellants
suffer
no
injury,
in
fact,
by
the
imposition
of
the
new
hampshire
commuter’s
income
tax.
we
are
asserting
that
this
tax
is
in
fact
a
balanced
provision,
designed
to
reach
non-residents
for
a
ratable
contribution
in
support
of
the
government,
this
is
the
language
which
appeared
in
shaffer
v.
carter
and
i
think
is
a
settled
principle
upon
which
a
state
can
tax
non-residents
upon
income
earned
within
its
jurisdiction.
i
think
it
appropriate
to
say
at
this
point
that
the
appellant’s
description
of
the
operation
of
the
tax,
although
i’ve
frankly
concede
that
the
provision
which
he
labels
a
sham
in
fact
does
not
reach
any
state
resident
with
any
tax
burden.
yet
i
would
stop
short
of
labeling
it
a
sham
because
if
you
read
the
taxing
statute
in
its
entirety,
you
see
that
in
fact
a
tax
is
imposed
sticking
to
the
strictly
legal
effect
of
the
word
imposed.
a
tax
is
imposed
on
residents
and
non-residents
alike.
and
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
don’t
think,
no.
i
think
that
the
short
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
no.
i
think
the
counsel
for
the
appellant’s
position
is
correct
that
he
can’t
conceive
of
one,
i
can’t
conceive
of
one.
the
--
i
think
in
my
brief,
i
have
attempted
to
analyze
the
language
of
that
provision
for
a
tax
upon
residents
in
the
light
in
which
it
was
intended
which
is
to
create
a
category
of
taxation.
in
that
light,
the
law
of
new
hampshire
is
of
interest
because
we
do
not
permit
a
desperate
rate
of
taxation
upon
the
same
classification
of
property,
that
is
to
say
we
could
not
have
a
graduated
income
tax.
so
statutes
in
new
hampshire
tend
to
pay
close
attention
to
the
description
of
the
classification
of
the
income
or
the
classification
rather
of
the
property
which
in
this
case
is
income
earned
in
a
state,
not
of
the
residents
of
the
person
earning
it.
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make
is
quite
simple
that
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
provision
purporting
to
tax
new
hampshire
residents
never
in
fact
does
so.
nevertheless,
the
effect
of
that
statute
--
of
that
part
of
the
statute
is
that
it
does
not
alter
the
tax
burden
of
any
resident.
likewise,
the
taxing
provisions
in
which
reaches
non-residents
does
not
and
cannot
under
its
own
terms
alter
the
net
tax
burden
of
any
nonresident
and
that
is
essentially
the
point
i
like
to
--
i
would
like
to
urge
upon
the
court
in
relation
to
the
-
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i’m
sorry
your
honor,
could
you
rephrase
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
there’s
no
question
of
what
the
statute
accomplishes
a
diversion
of
revenue
to
new
hampshire
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
a
--
that
is
--
at
least
it’s
a
political
decision.
i’m
not
certainly
authorized
to
state
but
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
we’ve
been
doing
it
for
a
long
time
your
honor.
i
don’t
dispute
that.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
hasten
to
point
that
out
your
honor
that
would
be
my
next
point,
to
be
sure
that
the
--
it
is
a
little
bit
awkward
to
see
taxpayers
in
here
urging
as
an
injury,
a
loss
of
revenue
by
the
state
of
maine.
we
are
urging
here
that
the
injury
which
the
appellants
attempt
to
set
up
if
there
is
indeed
any,
which
is
cognizable
in
terms
if
its
substantiality
runs
to
the
state
of
maine
and
not
to
these
appellants.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i’m
not
sure
that
--
i
think
to
answer
the
question
candidly
your
honor,
i
think
the
--
if
the
maine
law
were
to
be
phrased
in
that
terms,
it
maybe
subject
to
a
challenge,
but
it
would
certainly
be
--
the
answer
would
be
then
that
the
new
hampshire
law
is
being
challenged.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
the
case
your
honor.
i
think
the
maine
legislature
could
certainly
politically
take
the
position
that
we
consider
the
new
hampshire
tax
to
be
for
instance
unconstitutional
and
in
terms
both
for
that
reason
and
in
terms
of
reciprocity,
they
could
grant
a
credit
only
where
the
other
state
neglects
to
tax
or
chooses
not
to
tax
maine
residents.
that’s
what
reciprocity
is
all
about.
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
well,
your
honor
i
think
the
--
i’ll
bring
this
point
up
then
out
of
order
in
my
argument,
i
intended
to
make
it
last,
but
it’s
just
as
appropriate
now.
a
recent
case
in
new
jersey
considered
the
new
jersey’s
counterpart
fiat,
that
case
was
brought
here
and
was
recently
dismissed
by
this
court
for
one
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
the
holding
in
that
case
out
of
new
jersey
was
in
the
case
where
a
fee
was
assessed
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
on
trucks
operating
in
interstate
commerce
which
were
not
registered
in
new
jersey,
the
fee
is
assessed
to
the
extent
that
and
in
the
amount
that
state
of
registration
of
that
track
would
tax
a
new
jersey
truck.
and
the
court
went
into
great
length
and
great
detail
in
discussing
the
question
of
so
called
retaliatory
statutes
and
hinted
that
maybe
that
was
an
inappropriate
label
for
such
a
statute
because
in
fact
the
effect
of
them
is
to
further
and
encourage
reciprocity
and
comity
between
states.
i
think
the
new
hampshire
statute
has
a
considerable
element
of
that
nature
to
it.
in
fact,
section
6
of
the
new
hampshire
act
provides
that
the
taxing
administrator
may
enter
into
it,
reciprocity
agreement
which
--
under
which
we
would
cease
to
tax
the
nonresident
from
that
state
if
they
would
cease
to
tax
residents
of
new
hampshire
working
in
that
state.
under
that
--
under
those
terms,
since
maine
now
taxes
new
hampshire
residents,
we
would
be
in
a
position
to
say
if
you
stop
taxing
new
hampshire
residents,
we
will
stop
taxing
maine
residents
and
then
every
body
would
be
free
to
go
home
and
tax
their
own
people
an
that
would
be
the
end
of
that.
so
i
think
that
that’s
the
direct
answer
to
your
question
i
think
your
honor
that
the
statute,
this
statute,
the
new
jersey
statutes
as
illustrated
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
state
of
new
jersey,
all
operate
to
encourage
reciprocity.
in
the
mean
time,
i
do
not
deny
obviously
that
they
raise
revenue
for
the
state
of
new
hampshire
nor
what
i’ve
suspect,
new
jersey
deny
that
they
raise
revenue
for
the
state
of
new
jersey
but
the
force
behind
them
and
one
of
the
theories
upon
which
they
can
be
sustained
is
that
they
do
encourage
comity
and
they
do
encourage
reciprocity.
the
history
of
the
new
jersey
statute
is
very
enlightening
in
that
respect
because
it
started
off
on
the
basis
of
reciprocity
and
was
converted
by
the
state
of
new
york
changing
its
credit
arrangements.
moving
on,
we
suggest
that
the
facts
adduced
by
the
brief
filed
by
the
state
of
maine
referred
to
the
citizens,
all
the
citizens
of
maine
and
just
those
subject
to
the
commuter’s
income
tax.
plus
it
shows
that
even
that
impact,
that
injury
if
there
is
any,
a
secondary
having
first
passed
through
the
treasury
of
the
state
of
maine.
now,
i
say
that
addressing
the
point
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
additional
tax
burden
upon
the
residents
of
maine
because
of
the
loss
of
revenue
by
the
state
of
maine.
it
is
one
de
minimis.
the
state
of
maine
itself
adduces
the
fact
that
of
the
record
and
in
its
brief
that
the
total
--
the
net
increase
in
burden
for
instance
upon
each
citizen
is
$00.40.
i
would
submit
that
that
simply
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
injury
which
ought
to
permit
this
court
to
overrule
a
taxing
statute
of
a
sovereign
state
on
grounds
for
instance
of
equal
protection
or
for
that
matter
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
believe
the
tax
rate
in
the
state
of
maine
will
float
with
the
income,
i
believe
it’s
a
graduated
rate
but
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
that’s
correct
your
honor,
i
understand
the
point
you’re
trying
to
illustrate.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
the
withholding
of
the
tax
creates
a
situation
where
for
the
moment,
for
the
interim,
the
resident
of
maine
would
have
withheld
in
greater
amount
than
he
would
ultimately
have
to
pay
in
tax.
the
--
that
of
course
is
wiped
out
in
tax
here
when
everything
is
adjusted.
the
tax
imposed
will
never
reach
4%
for
--
excuse
me,
it
may
if
the
rate
rises
high
enough
in
the
state
of
maine
but
the
adjustment
will
be
made
at
the
end
of
the
year.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
and
that
--
no
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
the
laws
of
the
use
of
the
money
is
without
a
doubt,
it
can’t
be
denied.
i
still
suggest
that
in
these
terms
it’s
a
negligible
argument.
the
case
of
travis
v.
yale
&
town
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
thank
you
your
honor.[luncheon
break]
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
the
court
please
i
believe
i
was
in
the
middle
of
discussing,
finishing
up
on
the
point
of
the
withholding
tax
and
to
the
extent
to
which
that
accomplished
an
injury,
a
cognizable
injury
to
the
appellants
here.
i’m
maintaining
that
it
does
not
in
that
it
is
de
minimis
and
it’s
part
of
--
part
and
parcel
of
the
--
what
the
court
in
prior
decisions
has
labeled
the
necessary
administrative
burden
of
collecting
--
assessing
and
collecting
a
tax.
i
should
point
out
in
a
case
of
a
tax
upon
non-residents
that
in
fact
the
withholding
provision
is
just
about
the
only
way
that
the
state
who
is
collecting
the
tax
can
be
assured
of
getting
it
since
if
the
cash
has
let
out
of
the
state,
the
collection
then
becomes
an
out
of
state
proceeding
and
it’s
very
difficult.
the
case
of
travis
v.
yale
&
town
stood
for
the
proposition
that
the
withholding
arrangements
would
not
constitute
a
sufficient
injury
to
result
in
either
a
violation
of
privileges
and
immunities
or
a
deprivation
of
equal
protection.
moving
on,
i
assert
that
the
injury
which
exists
here
by
virtue
of
the
in
fact
diversion
of
revenue
is
an
injury
which
belongs
to
the
state
of
maine,
to
be
asserted
by
the
state
of
maine
if
by
anybody
at
all
and
that
to
that
extent,
this
case
brought
by
taxpayers
is
more
in
the
nature
of
political
question
and
an
attempt
by
the
taxpayers
to
litigate
the
interest
of
other
parties.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
your
right
your
honor.
i
think
i
have
the
liberty
here
to
say
that
i
did
argue
against
the
standing
of
these
plaintiffs
in
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
but
as
noted
in
the
--
in
footnote
in
the
flast
v.
cohen,
the
new
hampshire
supreme
court
has
one
of
the
most
liberal
attitudes
on
standing
in
the
country.
they
will
recognize
the
standing
of
just
about
anybody
which
is
perhaps
a
reflection
of
the
case
load
that
they
carry
and
i’ve
noted
in
the
brief
time
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
think
maybe
in
my
experience
up
there,
this
attitude
is
beginning
to
change.
but
i
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
right,
i
pointed
that
out
in
my
brief
your
honor.
there’s
no
question
what
this
court
has
different
standards
to
apply
when
considering
the
question
of
standing.
just
to
begin
with,
it
must
consider
the
fact
that
this
court’s
jurisdiction
is
limited
by
the
constitution
to
actual
cases
and
controversies.
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
elements
which
this
court
should
consider
in
deciding
the
extent
to
which
this
is
really
a
case
in
which
these
plaintiffs
have
an
interest
is
the
fact
that
the
expressions
of
interest
in
this
case
by
other
states
specifically,
vermont,
maine
and
new
jersey,
if
one
measure
just
how
much
an
interest
the
states
have
in
the
outcome
of
this,
and
is
again
a
measure
of
the
extent
to
which
this
is
really
a
contest
between
various
states
for
the
right
to
collect
revenues.
moving
on
again,
i
think
it
follows
almost
immediately
in
the
wake
of
our
contention
that
there
is
no
injury
in
fact
here
that
as
we
have
been
discussing,
the
appellants
have
no
standing
to
prosecute
this
appeal.
trying
to
condense
this
point
slightly,
i
think
its
one
book
law
that
standing
to
litigate
a
constitutional
issue
requires
a
demonstrable
injury
in
fact
upon
which
the
complaint
maybe
founded.
this
requirement
as
i
mentioned
is
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
constitutional
limitation
with
respect
to
cases
and
controversies,
but
also
i
think
reflects
fundamental
fact
that
the
constitution
is
not
designed
to
settle
specific
disputes,
but
rather
provides
certain
broad
and
rights
and
privileges.
thus,
a
complaint
under
the
constitution
is
primarily
a
complaint
about
conduct
which
results
in
a
deprivation
or
infringement
of
a
right
or
privilege.
in
other
words,
if
there
is
no
injury,
there
is
no
deprivation
and
the
complaint
should
not
--
a
complainant,
excuse
me,
should
not
be
heard
to
say
that
there
is.
this
illustrates
the
extent
to
which
in
my
brief
i
have
tried
to
tie
together
the
argument,
that
there
is
no
injury
with
the
argument,
that
there
is
no
standing
with
the
argument,
that
there
is
no
deprivation.
in
this
particular
circumstance,
i
think
the
whole
thing
turns
on
the
question
of
the
injury.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
think
if
there
is
a
conduct,
for
instance
an
action
by
a
state
your
honor
which
results
in
or
trespasses
upon
a
constitutional
right,
i
think
the
conduct
in
the
first
place,
the
action
by
the
state
results
in
say
an
injury
which
would
be
say
a
tax
burden,
an
increased
tax
burden,
a
disproportionate
tax
burden.
that
results
in
a
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
rights
under
certain
circumstances.
i
think
if
--
what
i’m
--
the
negative
pregnant
there
from,
is
that
if
there
is
no
additional
tax
burden
for
instance,
then
there
is
no
injury
to
that
particular
person
which
would
--
could
be
said
to
result
in
a
deprivation
of
a
constitutional
right.
i
think
that
is
the
--
that's
part
and
parcel
of
what
standing
in
case
in
controversy
arguments
are
all
about.
the
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
think
toomer
and
witsell,
if
i
recall
it
correctly
your
honor,
it
is
just
a
fee
case,
a
privilege
case.
and
the
disproportion
of
the
assessments
there
was
so
radical
as
to
practically
wipe
out
any
argument
that
there
were
for
instance
were
available
--
were
assessed
upon
resident's
other
fees
which
would
make
the
assessment
uniform.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
that’s
a
starting
point
your
honor
but
this
court
in
prior
decisions
has
indicated
that
you
need
not
stop
with
simply
state
assessed
taxes.
the
proper
inquiry
is
what
is
the
total
tax
burden
upon
the
resident
used
to
defray
the
expenses
of
government
and
government
includes
both
the
state
and
municipal
subdivisions.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
can
--
the
more
i
have
examined
this
case,
the
more
i
think
that
argument
can
be
made.
i
think
in
the
stance
in
which
this
case
rests
now,
my
argument
is
that
it
is
conceivable
that
this
is
so.
that
there
is
some
kind
of
approximate
balance
and
it
is
sufficiently
conceivable
that
is
--
that
that
is
so
that
the
plaintiff
who
wants
to
challenge
this
statute
should
have
an
affirmative
burden
to
show
that
it
is
not.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
we
do
your
honor,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
no,
if
the
--
well,
to
that
extent,
all
that
reflects
is
a
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i’m
not
sure
that
there
are
very
many
out
of
staters
who
are
working
in
new
hampshire,
who
are
not
hit
by
this
tax.
the
only
instance
in
which
an
out
of
stater
subject
to
a
tax
would
escape
from
it
is
if
his
own
state
had
no
income
tax.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
no
your
honor,
the
taxable
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
that’s
probably
the
case
your
honor.
if
there
are
--
that
situation
would
obtain,
but
this
reflects
not
so
much
an
invidious
discrimination
as
it
isn’t
recognition
by
the
new
hampshire
legislature
that
where
a
state
does
not
tax,
it
necessary
--
its
own
citizens,
it
does
not
tax
our
residents,
we
will
not
tax
theirs.
that
is
again
a
reciprocity
argument.
it
recognizes
the
interest
in
furthering
reciprocity
to
that
extent.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
correct
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
yes
they
do
your
honor
and
that
accounts
far
in
a
way
the
bulk
of
the
taxpayers
under
this
tax.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
don’t
believe
there
is
any
data.
i
could
be
corrected
on
that
if
my
brother
knows
of
some,
but
i’m
not
aware
of
any
data
which
would
indicate
what
proportion
of
the
taxpayers
are
from
other
than
those
three
states
or
for
that
matter
which
are
not
some
point
not
being
taxed.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
presumably.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
it’s
my
understanding
your
honor
that
they
would
be
reached
by
the
withholding
provision.
in
other
words,
they
would
be
taxed
for
that
part
of
the
calendar
tax
year,
the
tax
year
that
they
worked.
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
new
--
to
the
extent
any
question
is
addressed
which
raises
the
specter
of
a
nonresident
not
being
taxed.
that
is
certainly
not
anything
about
which
that
nonresident
can
complain.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
no
it
isn’t,
it
isn't
and
moving
along
the
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
it
begins
at
4%
your
honor
but
it
is
automatically
reduced
to
whatever
rate
the
non-residents
home
state
would
apply.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
never
be
higher.
the
--
at
the
end
of
the
calendar
year
after
the
returns
are
filed
and
adjustments
made
and
rebates
issued,
the
tax
will
be
precisely
the
same
as
the
taxpayer
would
have
paid
to
his
home
state
in
call
cases
and
on
the
same
earnings,
of
course
they
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
nothing
in
excess.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
he
gets
it
all
back
if
the
withholding
is
in
excess
which
it
maybe
in
some
cases
as
i
have
said.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
he
may
take
it
until
the
end
of
the
year.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
can’t
--
may
say
that
your
honor.
i
could
say
that
it’s
a
de
minimis
injury.
the
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
which
is
an
injury
if
anything
to
the
state
of
maine
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
it
is
given
away
your
honor.
i
think
i
have
to
comeback
to
that
point.
the
key
to
the
loss
of
revenue
on
part
to
the
state
of
maine
is
held
by
the
state
of
maine.
it’s
their
credit
provision
your
honor.
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
it
goes
out
of
the
hands
of
the
taxpayer,
but
again
that
part
of
it
is
a
political
question.
the
state
of
maine
could
solve
that
problem
simply
by
phrasing
the
issue
directly
by
removing
that
credit
then
we
would
have
without
question,
a
controversy.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
no
question,
we
would
fall
immediately
into
an
equal
protection
problem
where
we
could
necessarily
have
to
get
in
to
the
business
of
trying
to
balance
the
relative
burden
of
taxation.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
and
i
think
my
contention
is
in
scope
to
this
argument
that
privileges
and
immunities
and
equal
protection
in
this
type
of
case
are
so
closely
entangled,
it’s
pretty
much
impossible
to
take
them
apart.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
if
the
principle
to
be
applied
your
honor
is
that
the
state
will
not
--
our
state
will
not
tax
a
nonresident
in
excess
of
the
rate
which
his
own
state
applies
to
him
and
if
that
happens
to
create
an
inequality
among
non-residents,
i
don’t
think
that
rises
to
a
prosecution.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i’m
not
suggesting
that
we
are
affirmatively
striving
for
that
goal.
it’s
something
to
which
has
to
be
approximated
otherwise
we
have
constitutional
problems.
the
principle
objective
is
to
do
unto
the
non-resident
taxpayer
precisely
as
his
state
does
under
him.
the
option
for
that
state
than
being
to
cease
to
tax
are
own
residents
to
the
extent
that
for
instance
the
state
of
maine
tries
to
say
that
our
taxing
their
citizens
at
their
rate
is
not
rational
for
instance,
how
then
do
they
justify
taxing
new
hampshire
residents
at
the
same
rate
and
they
in
fact
do
to
the
--
i
submit
to
the
extent
that
the
state
of
maine
can
justify
taxing
new
hampshire
residents
at
the
maine
tax
rate
and
say
that
that
is
in
any
way
a
ratable
contribution
to
the
support
of
government,
then
to
the
same
extent
can
new
hampshire
say
that
taxing
maine
residents
is
precisely
for
that
purpose
and
to
the
same
extent
a
rationale
basis.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
two
people,
same
income
both
in
--
working
in
new
hampshire?
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
if
one
of
them
came
from
maine
and
one
of
them
came
from
massachusetts,
yes
they
would
be
taxed
under
our
tax
differently.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
think
disparate
of
taxation
is
the
fact
of
life
all
over
this
country
your
honor.
double
taxation
exists.
i’m
not
trying
to
dodge
it.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
i
think
that’s
a
fair
example.
hadn’t
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
every
state
your
honor
which
has
a
graduated
income
tax
with
for
instance
part
of
the
graduation
of
which
is
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
alright,
let
me
finish
your
honor.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
the
part
of
the
graduation
of
which
involves
various
exemptions
or
deductions
is
going
to
windup
taxing
disparately.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
the
rate
--
your
point
is
well
taken
your
honor,
i’m
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
it
maybe
indeed
unique
except
i’m
not
sure
whether
the
states
of
new
jersey
is
in
the
same
situation.
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
precisely
there
is
no
--
mr.
charles
g.
cleaveland
the
irritation
which
the
situation
creates
is
obvious
your
honor.
one
more
point
and
one
more
reason
why
that
is
properly
called
a
political
question.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
think
my
time
is
expires.
