mr.
robert
l.
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it’s
clear
from
the
argument
you’ve
just
heard
that
the
validity
of
this
tax
depends
on
who
is
taxed
for
doing
what.
now,
the
tax
is
not
laid
by
the
regulation,
it
is
laid
by
a
state
statute
of
mississippi,
and
the
tax
is
laid
on
the
business
of
wholesaling
liquor
within
the
state.
the
state
has
preempted
for
itself
that
business
and
the
tax
takes
the
form
of
a
collection
of
the
difference
between
the
wholesaler’s
price
and
the
price
of
the
retailer,
less
of
course,
whatever
wholesaling
cost
the
state
may
incur.
now,
the
regulation
gives
the
military
an
option.
i
take
it
they’re
not
complaining
about
the
option
because
an
option
is
not
a
burden,
an
option
is
a
privilege.
what
the
regulation
does
is
give
them
a
flexibility
they
wouldn’t
otherwise
have
by
allowing
them
to
order
direct
in
certain
instances.
but
when
they
do
order
direct
from
the
distiller,
this
distiller
then
of
course
is
sharing
in
the
state’s
wholesale
monopoly
and
must
account
to
the
state
for
the
state’s
wholesale
markup,
which
is
the
tax,
the
difference
between
the
wholesaler’s
price
and
the
price
to
the
retailers.
now,
those
prices
are
not
set
by
the
state.
each
distiller
sets
his
own
price.
he
makes
his
own
deal
whether
he
deals
either
directly
with
the
state,
or
whether
he
deals
directly
with
the
distiller,
but
in
both
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
the
regulation
tells
him
of
course.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
he
is
supposed
of
course
to
collect
a
markup
so
that
he
will
have
the
funds
to
pay
the
state
its
tax.
but
he
--
the
tax
is
laid
on
him,
he
is
required
to
pay
the
markup
to
the
state
whether
or
not
he
ever
collects
it
from
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well
he
has
to
invoice
it
of
course.
this
tax
is
a
percentage
of
the
wholesaler’s
price
and
the
only
way
you’d
know
in
these
exceptional
situations
where
he’s
allowed
to
buy
from
the
distiller
what
the
amount
of
tax
is,
is
to
require
him
to
list
on
the
invoice
the
wholesaler’s
price
and
the
amount
--
the
percentage
amount
which
reflects
the
state’s
markup
or
tax.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it
is
an
out
--
well,
when
the
state
itself
of
course,
when
it
sells
to
private
retailer
collects
the
tax
in
the
form
of
the
purchase
price
of
the
liquor.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
he
pays
it
first
before
he
pays
the
tax
when
he
bills
the
retailer,
and
it’s
a
matter
of
the
total
indifference
to
the
state
whether
or
not
he
then
is
able
to
receive
reimbursement
for
the
tax,
but
by
the
nature
of
things,
a
tax
which
takes
the
form
of
a
wholesale
markup,
even
without
any
urging.
if
dr.
beecham
would
never
written
that
letter,
telling
them
that
they
should
collect
the
tax
from
the
purchaser,
any
wholesale
excise
tax,
a
tax
laid
on
wholesale
sales
is
collected
by
the
businessman
from
--
to
the
retailer
because
it
is
a
cost
of
doing
business.
if
he
doesn’t
collect
it,
he’s
no
businessman.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
he
is
responsible
for
it,
whether
collects
it
or
not.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes,
there
is
a
time.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
he
pays
it
at
the
time
that
he
invoices
the
liquor,
yes.
he
pays
it,
and
then
he
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no.
the
district
court
pointed
that
out.
he
is
liable
for
the
payment
at
the
point
where
he
invoices,
ships
the
liquor.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no,
the
tax
is
not
--
this
is
the
whole
point.
the
tax
is
not
a
tax
levied
on
the
persona,
it’s
a
tax
levied
on
wholesale
sales.
that’s
the
subject
matter
of
the
tax,
that’s
the
privilege.
the
excised
is
exacted
for
the
privilege
of
doing
the
wholesale
business
in
the
state
of
mississippi
and
that
tax
is
measured
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
certainly.
it
fell
right
as
the
state
is
never
to
my
knowledge
ever
you’ll
notice
the
letters
in
the
record
here,
they
are
not
addressed
to
the
military
retailers,
they’re
addressed
to
the
distillers.
and
they
are
the
people
who
must
pay
the
tax
to
the
state
when
they
choose
to
do
the
wholesaling
themselves,
instead
of
using
the
state’s
wholesale
facilities
to
distribute
their
liquor.
that’s
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes?
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
suggest
that
the
purpose
of
the
option
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
retailers
rather
than
for
the
state,
although
the
state
does
benefit
to
this
extent.
the
state
of
course
as
the
exclusive
distributor
in
the
state,
stocks
almost
all
the
brands
you
ever
heard
of
and
some
you
didn’t.
there
is
a
vodka
made
in
vicksburg
called
doctor
chicago
that
the
state
stocks.
but
there
are
very
--
there
are
odd
all
sorts
of
off
brands
that
some
people
want
that
the
state
may
not
necessarily
stock,
and
it
is
a
convenience
for
the
military
clubs
when
they
want
to
get
one
of
those
brands
that
the
state
doesn’t
stock
to
order
it
direct
from
the
distiller.
that’s
the
purpose
of
the
option
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no
they
don’t
mr.
justice
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
they
do
buy
all
kinds.
all
i’m
suggesting
is
there
are
certain
kinds
which
the
state
does
not
stock.
and
in
that
sense,
the
option
is
a
convenience
to
them
because
they
can
then
not
go
through
the
slower
process
of
going
ordering
especially
through
the
state.
they
can
go
directly
to
the
distiller,
order
it
from
him,
but
in
that
case
of
course,
the
tax
will
be
collected
from
the
distiller.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
if
they
found
out
about
it,
there’s
no
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
--
of
course
it’s
quite
possible.
we
don’t
know
how
much
liquor
maybe
going
into
those
bases
flown
in
or
taken
in
on
a
destroyer
without
any
knowledge
of
the
state.
all
that’s
involved
here
are
sales
made
by
distillers
who
do
exploit
the
mississippi
market.
that
is
the
sellers
who
do
not
want
to
sell
not
only
to
the
military
retailers,
but
want
also
to
sell
the
private
retailers
in
mississippi
through
the
state’s
wholesale
facilities,
that’s
all
it’s
involved
here.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
if
it
was
brought
in
for
resale.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no
well
if
this
--
no,
the
wholesale
tax
applies
only
--
this
tax
only
applies
to
liquor
brought
--
bought
for
resale
within
the
state,
and
this
is
where
the
buck
act
is
decisive.
now,
the
buck
act
was
passed
to
make
precisely
this
kind
of
taxation
possible.
the
buck
act
was
enacted
in
1940.
now,
a
1937
case,
the
case
of
james
against
dravo
contracting
company
had
held
that
you
did
not
impose
an
unconstitutional
burden
on
the
united
states
because
your
receipts
were
derived
from
the
united
states.
you
could
sell
to
united
states
and
you
could
still
tax
the
sales,
that’s
what
west
virginia
did.
west
virginia
taxed
the
receipts
of
contractors
--
construction
contractors
from
federal
work,
and
the
james
case
sustained
that
tax
except
where
the
contractor
was
working
on
an
exclusive
jurisdiction
base.
the
james
case
held
as
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
bases,
the
state
has
no
power
to
tax,
but
it
held
that
the
fact
that
the
sales
were
to
the
united
states
did
not
prevent
it
from
taxing
those
sales
on
the
other
bases.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
buck
act
as
stated
in
the
senate
report
which
is
in
appendix
to
our
brief
was
to
extend
the
doctrine
of
the
james
case
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
bases.
that’s
what
the
purpose
of
the
act
was,
to
wipe
out
this
distinction
that
james
had
created
between
exclusive
jurisdiction
bases
and
other
joint
jurisdiction
bases.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
well,
107
was
supposed
to
preserve
whatever
constitutional
immunity
--
whatever
intergovernmental
tax
immunity
that
federal
instrumentalities
might
have.
now,
i
suggest
to
you
that
if
you
look
carefully
at
the
case
of
collins
against
yosemite
park
company
again,
you
will
see
that
that
case
when
they’re
dealing
with
a
wholesale
liquor
tax,
in
that
case,
california’s
wholesale
liquor
tax
that
that
tax
was
sustained
because
the
court
found
no
constitutional
immunity
and
were
not
interfering
with
a
federal
function
by
taxing
sales.
you’ll
recall
in
the
yosemite
park
case,
the
federal
government
had
exclusive
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
the
park.
the
state
however,
when
it
had
ceded
the
park,
a
land
had
reserved
general
taxing
rights
and
so
the
court
when
it
decided
the
case
held
that
california
could
not
impose
license
fees
on
the
interior
department
concessionaire
in
that
case,
but
that
it
could
and
did
impose
its
wholesaler’s
excise
tax
on
that
retailer.
now,
that
was
done
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
retailer
had
in
that
case
bought
his
liquor
outside
the
state,
but
he
had
bought
it
for
resale
inside
the
state,
which
is
exactly
what
the
courts
were
talking
about
here,
were
made
for,
and
you
have
precisely
the
same
kind
of
a
tax,
a
tax
on
wholesale
transactions.
and
as
the
yosemite
case
held
the
fact
that
in
that
case,
direct
collection
was
made
of
that
wholesale
sales
tax
from
the
federal
retailer
did
not
invalidate
the
tax.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
tax,
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
think
it’s
as
far
as
regulation
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no.
what
you’re
doing
here
is
applying
a
tax
on
wholesale
sales,
that
is
sales
made
to
a
retailer
for
a
resale.
that’s
what’s
being
taxed,
those
sales.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
they
certainly
are,
if
your
honor
please,
they
are
--
the
liquor
is
invoiced
to
the
bases
and
is
resold
on
the
bases.
the
buck
act
has
said
that
those
sales
for
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it
certainly
does.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
that
was
its
expressed
purpose.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
a
sale
tax?
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
think
you
probably
could,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
if
you’re
talking
about
a
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
let
me
point
out
one
more
aspect
in
which
this
regulation
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it
takes
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
the
buck
act
also
gives
authority
to
the
state
to
go
in
and
collect
its
sales
tax
on
exclusive
jurisdiction
bases.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
that’s
what
it
says.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
that’s
--
that
was
its
purpose,
was
as
i
say,
to
wipe
out
this
prior
distinction
the
james
case
had
made
in
the
exclusive
and
concurrent
jurisdiction
bases.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
wright
any
kind
of
[laughter]
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
wright
[laughter
attempt]
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i
suppose
the
military
could
bar
anyone
from
a
base
they
please,
but
the
purpose
of
the
buck
act
is
made
quite
clear
in
the
senate
report
that
and
it
was
to
treat
all
federal
enclaves
whether
they’re
exclusive
or
concurrent
enclaves
alike.
that
this
did
extend
the
state’s
taxing
power
insofar
as
tax
is
measured
by
sales.
only
that
kind
of
taxes
are
concerned
and
that’s
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
the
107
(a)
is
admittedly
both
sides
agree
that
that
is
only
supposed
to
preserve
whatever
constitutional
immunity
arises
from
the
fact
that
these
clubs
are
federal
instrumentalities.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
a
constitutional
amendment
--
going
--
sales
to
the
united
states,
taxes
on
sales
to
the
united
states
haven’t
been
regarded
by
this
tax
--
this
court
as
taxes
on
the
purchasers
since
the
panhandle
oil
case.
panhandle
oil
against
mississippi
held
that
sales
of
gasoline
to
the
united
states
were
in
effect
taxes
on
the
united
states.
that
was
the
dissent
--
the
dissenting
opinion
was
the
one
in
which
justice
holmes
replied
to
the
majority’s,
rather
about
the
power
of
the
taxes
being
the
power
to
destroy
a
homestead
not
while
this
court
sits.
and
that
dissenting
opinion
of
holmes
became
prevailing
law
in
the
james
case
and
in
the
king
&
boozer
case
where
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes,
it
was.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
explicitly
repudiated
panhandle
oil,
so
this
--
there
is
no
--
there
are
no
constitutional
tax
immunity
decisions
of
this
court
which
say
that
a
tax
on
sales
to
the
united
states
and
one
of
its
instrumentalities
are
taxes
on
the
united
states.
that
much
is
clearer.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
they
bought
it
directly
--
court
held
it
was.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
had
it
been
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
had
it
been
laid
on
the
retailer,
it
probably
would’ve
been
invalid.
but
the
point
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
what?
mr.
robert
l.
wright
if
the
tax
were
laid
on
the
privilege
of
retailing,
now
mississippi
has
a
liquor
tax
on
the
privilege
of
retailing.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it
would’ve
been
precisely
the
same,
because
in
that
case,
the
court
held,
if
you’re
talking
about
what
that
court
would’ve
done.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
you
have
the
answer
in
the
james
case.
the
tax
was
imposed
on
sales
made
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
right.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes,
that
would
be
invalid.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
that
would
come
within
the
buck
act
exemption.
but
i
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes,
that’s
107.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
well,
the
sales
made
in
the
officer’s
club
are
not
of
issue
here,
because
we
do
have
a
regulation
which
exempts
the
military
clubs.
this
is
the
same
regulation
they
complain
about.
it
exempts
all
the
sales
they
make
from
retail
sales
taxes,
that’s
a
5%
tax,
and
the
regulation
also
exempts
the
clubs,
exempts
the
clubs
from
the
gallonage
tax
that
the
state
imposes
on
retailers
for
the
privilege
of
making
retail
sales.
those
taxes
on
those
privileges
are
the
military
clubs
are
exempted
from.
now
this
tax,
the
wholesaler’s
tax
is
levied
on
a
business
that
those
clubs
don’t
engage
in.
it
is
levied
on
the
business
of
making
wholesale
sales
of
liquor
in
mississippi
and
distributed
at
mississippi.
that’s
a
function
that
the
military
clubs
do
not
perform.
the
tax
is
not
laid
on
them.
it
is
laid
on
the
distillers
whom
the
state
permits
to
perform
it.
now,
that
is
a
situation
where
you
don’t
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
right.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes,
mississippi
has
a
retailer’s
tax
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
its
gallonage
tax.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
it’s
an
excise
tax
on
the
privilege
of
selling
liquor
at
retail.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
there’s
a
$2.50
a
gallon
tax
on
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
the
record
is
clear
that
the
exemptions
and
the
regulation
permitted
the
clubs
both
to
buy
liquor
cheaper
than
any
civilian
retailer
in
mississippi
could
buy
it
and
to
sell
it
cheaper
and
to
still
make
profits.
now
and
there
was
no
proof
that
those
profits
that
were
so
made
were
inadequate
for
any
federal
purpose.
that’s
why
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
wright
no,
we
--
we
have
the
--
collected
this
from
the
distillers.
the
state
is
suing
mississippi
to
get
back
from
them
taxes
which
were
collected
from
the
distillers
who
were
passed
on
all
the
way
down
to
the
line
of
the
people
who
drank
the
liquor.
as
far
as
that
goes,
the
element
burden
of
course
of
any
excise
tax
falls
on
the
drinker.
mr.
robert
l.
wright
right.
that
much
is
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
that
much
is
clear
with
respect
to
any
--
mr.
robert
l.
wright
any
excise
tax.
now,
i
just
want
to
say
a
word
about
this
alleged
conflict
occurring
between
the
armed
services
between
the
federal
procurement
policy
and
the
state’s
policy.
now
this
regulation,
the
military
regulation
we’re
talking
about
is
one
which
is
not
to
even
purport
to
implement
the
armed
services
procurement
act.
it’s
a
regulation
issued
under
the
draft
extension
act,
the
act
extending
the
manpower
draft
in
1951,
which
doesn’t
mention
taxes,
doesn’t
say
anything
about
standards
for
the
federal
procurement
of
supplies.
now,
one
thing
more
i
wanted
to
--
there
is
therefore
no
--
there’s
no
federal
statute
that’s
in
conflict
with
anything
of
the
state
is
doing
here.
there’s
one
thing
more
i
want
to
add
that
that
record
that
the
military’s
own
regulation
provides
that
these
retailers
can’t
sell
at
prices
more
than
10%
lower
than
what
the
civilian
retailers
in
the
same
area
are
charging.
so
that
the
only
effect
of
giving
the
military
an
even
lower
price
than
what
they
now
get
would
simply
to
be
to
increase
the
profits
the
military
retailers
at
the
expense
of
state
revenues.
now,
that
is
only
one
thing
more
i
want
to
point
that
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned,
there’s
certainly
is
no
conflict
between
the
tenth
amendment
and
the
supremacy
clause.
the
tenth
amendment
is
now
the
state
source
of
taxing
powers.
states
have
been
taxing
fully
in
excise
taxes
on
sales
of
liquor
ever
since
they
were
colonies.
the
first
one
was
laid
by
the
massachusetts
colony
in
1646,
and
this,
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted,
revenue
from
liquor
sales
was
an
important
source
of
revenue
for
all
of
those
things.
and
what
you’re
talking
about
here
is
not
depriving
the
united
states
of
any
right
it
may
have
to
tax
liquor.
it
too
can
tax
liquor
for
its
purposes,
but
what
the
government
is
arguing
here
is
that
the
state
cannot
tax
liquor
sales
that
are
made
to
these
military
clubs.
although,
this
whole
wholesale
excise
taxation
is
historically
a
right
they
were
exercising
and
it
was
preserved
to
them
when
the
tenth
amendment
was
adopted.
if
the
tenth
amendment
means
anything
at
all
today,
it
certainly
means
that
the
state’s
right
to
tax
liquor
was
not
impaired
by
any
other
provisions
of
the
constitution.
now
that
--
i
want
to
say
one
word
about
the
agricultural
bank
case.
as
counsel
pointed
out
it
is
not
a
tax
immunity,
and
not
constitutional
tax
immunity
only.
it
has
really
nothing
to
do,
as
i
see
it,
whether
the
problem
you’re
presented
here
which
deals
with
the
taxation
of
liquor
rests
on
an
entirely
different
phase
than
the
taxation
of
national
banks.
what
m’culloch
against
maryland
did
of
course
was
maryland
did
try
to
own
federal
affliction.
maryland
tried
to
impose
a
tax
on
the
creation
of
currency
by
the
bank
of
united
states.
they
wanted
the
state
banks
to
have
the
only
right
to
create
currency.
that’s
the
kind
of
state
tax
that
very
clearly
impairs
a
federal
function
and
there
is
no
such
impairment
involved
here
at
all.
the
tax
that’s
been
laid
on
these
wholesale
sales
doesn’t
prevent
these
military
clubs
from
doing
anything
that
they’re
authorized
and
expected
to
do,
and
that
is
buy
and
sell
liquor
cheaper
than
any
one
else
and
earn
a
profit
on
the
sales.
