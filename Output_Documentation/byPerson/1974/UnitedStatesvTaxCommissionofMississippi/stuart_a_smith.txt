mr.
stuart
a.
smith
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
here
again
on
a
second
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
to
consider
certain
issues
which
were
not
reached
by
the
court
in
its
first
--
in
its
consideration
of
the
first
appeal.
the
broad
question
presented
is
whether
a
regulation
of
the
mississippi
state
tax
commission
imposes
an
unconstitutional
state
tax
upon
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states.
the
regulation
in
question
requires
out
of
state
liquor
distillers
to
collect
tax
from
military
purchasing
facilities
and
to
remit
this
tax
to
the
state
tax
commission.
it
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
upholding
the
validity
of
the
tax
as
applied
to
these
sales
to
the
military
purchases
in
the
four
bases
within
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
facts
as
before
are
largely
undisputed
and
stipulated.
prior
to
1966,
mississippi
completely
prohibited
the
sale
or
possession
of
alcoholic
beverages.
in
1966,
it
adopted
a
local
option
beverage
control
law.
those
statutes
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
at
pages
47
and
48.
the
new
law
provided
that
the
state
tax
commission
was
to
be
the
sole
importer
and
wholesaler
of
alcoholic
beverages
within
mississippi.
under
the
statute,
the
state
tax
commission
is
authorized
to
sell
liquor
to
retailers
in
the
state,
including
any
retailers
on
military
posts
within
the
state.
a
related
statute
provides
that
the
commission
shall
add
such
markups
within
its
discretion
to
cover
cost
and
provide
profit.
so,
the
statutory
scheme
essentially
established
a
monopoly
by
the
state
of
mississippi
in
the
wholesaling
of
liquor.
but
the
state
tax
commission
promulgated
so
called
regulation
25,
which
is
really
at
the
heart,
the
validity
of
which
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
that
regulation
permits
the
military
to
purchase
liquor
from
the
commission
as
could
anyone
in
mississippi,
or
directly
from
the
distillers.
however,
the
regulation
goes
on
to
provide
that
if
the
military
chooses
to
exercise
its
option
to
purchase
liquor
directly
from
the
distiller,
then
the
regulation
provides
that
the
distiller
must
collect
the
markup
from
the
military
and
remit
that
markup
to
the
state
tax
commission;
the
same
markup
that
would’ve
been
applicable
had
the
military
purchased
the
liquor
from
the
state
tax
commission.
now,
during
the
time
at
issue
here,
the
markup
with
respect
to
distilled
spirits
was
17%,
and
with
respect
to
wine
was
20%.
now,
there
are
four
military
bases
in
mississippi
which
this
court
explored
on
the
first
appeal.
there
are
two
bases
over
which
the
united
states
maintains
exclusive
jurisdiction.
those
are
the
keesler
air
force
base
and
the
naval
construction
battalion
center.
there
are
two
other
bases
over
which
the
united
states
and
mississippi
maintain
concurrent
jurisdiction.
these
are
the
columbus
air
force
base
and
the
meridian
naval
air
station.
now
prior
to
1966,
mississippi
was
a
dry
state,
but
even
during
that
time,
the
military
purchased
liquor
from
the
out
of
state
distillers.
now
after
1966
when
the
new
statute
came
into
effect,
the
military
continued
the
same
practice
of
purchasing
liquor
from
out
of
state
distillers
directly.
now,
after
regulation
25
became
effective,
which
essentially
told
the
military
that
even
if
they
had
continued
their
past
procurement
practice,
they
were
going
to
have
to
pay
over
the
tax
to
the
mississippi
tax
commission.
the
military
attempted
to
persuade
the
mississippi
state
tax
authorities
that
the
collection
of
this
tax
on
direct
purchases
was
improper.
as
a
means
of
providing
of
some
kind
of
interim
accommodation,
the
military
suggested
that
the
amount
of
taxes
at
issue
be
paid
into
an
escrow
fund,
and
kept
there
until
the
matter
could
be
judicially
determined.
but
mississippi
rejected
that
suggestion
and
in
fact
warned
distillers
that
if
they
did
not
pay
over
the
tax
to
the
state
tax
commission
on
their
direct
sales
to
the
military,
they
would
be
subject
to
the
criminal
penalties
that
were
--
which
were
imposed
on
the
alcoholic
beverage
act,
and
they
would
also
be
subject
to
delisting,
which
essentially
meant
they
would
loose
their
privileges
to
sell
their
products
to
the
state
tax
commission
for
retailing
in
mississippi.
so
because
of
this
onerous
position
taken
by
mississippi,
the
military
had
no
choice,
at
least
for
the
interim,
to
pay
the
amount
of
tax
that
mississippi
claimed
to
be
due
and
owing.
as
of
july
1971,
the
record
indicates
that
there
was
some
$650,000.00
collected,
and
now,
military
advised
me
that
as
of
the
beginning
of
this
year,
the
sum
is
something
like
$1,250,000.00.
now
this
particular
suit
was
brought
in
1969
before
a
three-judge
district
court.
the
united
states
asked
for
three
modes
of
relief;
a
declaration
that
regulation
25
was
unconstitutional
because
it
imposed
a
tax
upon
federal
instrumentalities,
an
injunction
against
its
further
enforcement,
and
a
money
judgment
in
the
amount
of
the
taxes
that
had
thus
far
been
collected.
now
the
first
time
around,
the
three-judge
district
court
simply
held
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
preempted
the
entire
field,
and
that
that
empowered
the
state
of
mississippi
to
impose
this
tax
on
sales
to
military
purchases.
on
the
first
direct
appeal,
this
court
reversed
and
vacated
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
it
held
with
respect
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
basis
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
had
no
application.
the
reason
and
that
the
majority
of
this
court
indicated
was
simply
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
which
speaks
of
importation
of
alcoholic
beverages
into
any
state
did
not
apply
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
bases,
because
those
bases
as
the
district
court
itself
acknowledged
in
its
first
consideration
might
as
well
have
been
in
a
sister
state
or
in
a
foreign
country,
they
simply
are
not
part
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
but
the
court
did
not
reach
the
issues
which
are
now
before
it
for
resolution,
that
is
questions
of
intergovernmental
immunity
and
with
respect
to
both
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
bases
and
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
bases.
now
on
remand,
the
district
court
again
dismissed
the
federal
government
suit
and
it
did
so
by
holding
that
the
tax
at
issue
here
was
on
the
out
of
state
distiller
and
not
on
the
military
purchases
so
that
there
was
no,
supposedly,
no
unconstitutional
tax
on
the
united
states.
the
district
court
further
held
that
even
if
a
tax
were
on
the
military
purchaser,
congress
had
consented
to
the
tax,
and
the
district
court
rejected
the
government’s
constitutional
tax
immunity
doctrine
argument
on
the
same
ground.
now,
before
i
begin
to
talk
about
what
the
parties
disagree
about,
i
think
it
ought
to
be
--
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
if
i
set
forth
what
our
three
points
of
agreement
between
the
united
states
and
the
state
of
mississippi
in
this
lawsuit.
to
begin
with,
the
parties
are
in
agreement
with
the
district
court’s
conclusion
that
the
state’s
regulation
25
imposes
a
tax.
secondly,
that
the
parties
are
in
agreement
with
the
district
court’s
finding
that
the
ship
stores,
the
officer’s
clubs
and
the
post
exchanges
involved
in
these
cases
on
both
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
bases
and
on
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
bases
are
federal
instrumentalities.
as
federal
instrumentalities,
as
arms
of
the
federal
government,
they
are
entitled
to
whatever
immunity
from
state
taxation
that
the
united
states
would
enjoy.
and
thirdly,
the
parties
agree
with
the
district
court’s
statement
in
this
case
that
the
constitutional
principle
of
federal
tax
immunity
which
this
court
has
reaffirmed
on
many
occasions,
applies
only
to
bar
a
tax
whose
legal
incidence
falls
upon
the
united
states.
so,
putting
aside
those
three
points
of
agreement,
i
would
like
to
now
turn
to
what
we
think
is
the
essential
point
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
error
of
the
district
court’s
holding
that
the
legal
incidence
of
this
tax
is
not
on
the
united
states.
now,
the
district
court
construe
the
term
legal
incidence,
which
this
court
has
used
many
times,
to
mean
the
legally
enforceable
liability
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
would
we
be
making
the
same
argument?
i
think
so.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
i
think
--
i
think
this
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
the
court
has
on
occasion
in
its
intergovernmental
immunity
cases
stated
that
what
the
state’s
highest
construction
of
its
statute
is
certainly
persuasive,
but
in
the
agricultural
bank
case
upon
which
we
heavily
rely,
i
think
the
court
also
said
that
“as
since
it
doesn’t
involve
a
constitutional
principle,
that
the
court
feels
free
to
reexamine
the
basis
of
that
state
court’s
holding.”
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don’t
think
so.
i
don’t
think
so
for
this
purpose.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
is
at
least
this
much,
i
suppose
that
it
is
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that’s
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
that’s
absolutely
right
mr.
justice
brennan,
but
in
the
agricultural
bank
case,
i
think
the
court
after
stating
that
and
that
case
did
come
here
from
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts,
the
court
went
on
to
disagree
with
the
massachusetts'
highest
court’s
interpretation
of
their
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
oh,
i
think
that’s
absolutely
right,
i
think
that’s
absolutely
right.
we
don’t
--
we
think
on
the
basis
of
the
court’s
analysis
in
agricultural
bank
versus
state
tax
commission
that
the
legal
incidence
of
this
tax
plainly
falls
on
the
united
states
and
that
the
district
court’s
construction
of
the
term
legal
incidence
is
that
the
legally
enforceable
liability
for
nonpayment
is
an
improper
test.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
instructive
if
i’d
simply
compared
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
think
that
the
proper
definition
of
legal
incidence
is
that
where
--
in
other
words,
let
me
put
up
to
you
this
way,
that
if
the
statute
requires
that
the
tax
be
passed
on
and
collected
from
the
purchaser
as
it
was
in
massachusetts
and
as
it
is
in
this
case,
then
we
believe
that
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
falls
upon
the
purchaser
and
not
upon
the
vendor.
simply
because
the
vendor
pays
the
tax
over,
we
believe
it’s
simply
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
but
here,
as
in
massachusetts,
regulation
25
requires
that
the
out
of
state
distiller
pass
on
the
tax
to
the
military
and
indeed
if
there’s
any
--
if
there
was
any
question
about
the
interpretation
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don’t
think,
well
i
think
--
i
think
to
the
extent
that
our
opposition
talks
about
the
agricultural
bank
case
here,
i
think
what
they
have
argued
to
the
court
is
that
that
case
is
not
germane
because
it
didn’t
involve
a
constitutional
holding.
well,
we’re
fully
in
agreement
with
the
fact
that
agricultural
bank
did
not
involve
a
constitutional
holding
because
the
court
rested
the
immunity
of
national
banks
in
that
case
upon
a
federal
statute,
the
federal
statute
of
long
standing.
it
was
revised
statutes,
but
i’m
not
sure
that
our
--
my
opposition
really
addresses
itself
to
what
we
think
is
the
critical
point
of
agricultural
bank,
and
that
is
the
mode
of
analysis
that
the
court
used
to
construe
the
term
legal
incidence.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
do
place
some
emphasis
upon
that,
but
i
think
that
the
court
in
agricultural
bank
simply
said
that
in
fact,
it’s
really
right
at
the
end
because
of
the
same
point
was
made
in
agricultural
bank
and
the
court
right
at
the
end
of
its
opinion
said
“it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
force
of
the
law
is
such
that
regardless
of
sanctions,
businessmen
will
attempt
in
their
everyday
commercial
affairs
to
conform
to
its
provisions
as
written.
now,
the
provisions
as
written
in
the
massachusetts
tax
and
in
this
tax
require
the
out
of
state
distiller
to
pass
on
the
tax.
and
indeed
if
there
would
be
any
question
about
the
construction
of
regulation
25,
the
state
of
mississippi
issued
a
warning
to
the
out
of
state
distillers
saying
that
they
had
to
collect
the
tax
from
the
military
purchases.
that
warning
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
at
page
38
and
39.
it’s
a
letter
from
the
director
of
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
division,
which
says
“said
fee
must
be
invoiced
to
the
military
and
collected
directly
from
the
military
or
other
authorized
organization
located
on
the
military
base.
”
and
the
letter
concludes
by
saying
“in
addition
to
penalties
imposed
by
law,
products
presently
sold
by
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
division
will
be
delisted”
and
that
is
underlined.
i
think
that
if
there
would
be
any
question
of
construction,
i
think
that
the
administrative
position
that
the
state
tax
authorities
took
indicated
that
the
out
of
state
distiller
had
to
pass
on
this
tax.
and
since
he
had
to
pass
it
on
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
think
that
consistent
with
the
court’s
agricultural
bank
analysis
that
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
must
fall
upon
the
military
--
must
be
construed
to
fall
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
james
against
dravo
dealt
with
several
different
points,
but
i
think
that
there,
i
think
that
is
a
distinction
essentially
that
if
the
contractor
could
or
could
not.
those
cases
like
james
against
dravo
and
alabama
versus
king
&
boozer
on
which
the
opposition
relies,
and
i
think
turn
really
in
part
on
--
really
turn
on
the
question
of
who
is
the
purchaser
in
that
case.
i
don’t
think
there
was
any
quarrel
that
the
tax
fell
upon
the
purchaser.
in
fact,
the
agricultural
bank
analysis
of
this
court
is
not
really
new
to
agricultural
bank.
the
opinion
talks
about
--
cites
of
federal
land
bank
versus
bismarck
lumber
company,
which
is
way
back
in
volume
314
of
the
united
states
report.
this
is
standard
analysis
that
this
court
has
used
that
when
a
sales
tax
must
be
passed
on
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
purchaser.
the
court
referred
to
it
again
in
a
footnote
in
the
national
bellas
hess
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
the
legal
incidence
in
the
king
&
boozer
was
on
the
purchaser.
the
question
was,
then,
who
was
the
purchaser
and
the
court
finally
determined
that
the
purchaser
in
that
case
was
the
private
contractor.
we
don’t
have
any
private
contractor
in
this
case.
i
mean,
this
is
simply
a
question
the
federal
government
is
dealing
for
itself.
now
once
one
recognizes
that
the
tax
is
on
the
military
purchaser
that
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
military
purchaser,
then
it
cannot
be
valid,
then
it
is
unconstitutional,
unless
congress
has
consented
to
the
tax,
or
in
this
case
since
we’re
involved
with
alcoholic
beverages,
unless
the
twenty-first
amendment
holds
some
sway
in
this
area.
now,
i
would
like
to
--
our
analysis
now
proceeds
along
two
separate
lines
because
we
have
two
kinds
of
bases
involved
in
this
case.
we
have
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
bases
and
we
have
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
bases.
now,
on
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
bases,
it
is
plain
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
no
application
because
that
was
essentially
the
core
of
this
court’s
conclusion
on
the
first
direct
appeal.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
instrumentality
argument
is
the
same,
exactly.
so,
the
--
with
respect
to
keesler
and
the
naval
construction
battalion
center,
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
no
application.
so
the
only
other
avenue
under
which
the
tax
could
be
sustained
would
be
if
congress
had
given
consent
to
such
a
tax.
now,
mississippi
and
it
relies
upon
the
district
court’s
conclusion
that
section
105
(a)
of
the
buck
act
provides
such
consent.
now
that
statute
is
set
forth
in
our
appendix
to
our
brief
at
page
46,
and
it
essentially
says
that
“no
person
shall
be
relieved
from
liability
for
payment
of
any
sales
or
used
tax
levied
by
any
state
on
the
ground
that
the
sale
or
use
with
respect
to
which
the
tax
was
levied,
occurred
in
whole
or
in
part
within
a
federal
area.
”
so
as
far
as
the
district
court
read
that
language
and
said
“that
constitutes
congressional
consent.
”
we
disagree.
we
don’t
think
that
the
buck
act
--
that
that
provision
of
the
buck
act
can
be
read
in
isolation,
because
when
congress
passed
the
buck
act,
it
just
didn’t
enact
section
105,
but
it
also
enacted
section
107,
which
we
have
reproduced
directly
thereunder.
and
that
says
that
“the
provisions
of
section
105
shall
not
be
deemed
to
authorize
the
levy
or
collection
of
any
tax
on
or
from
the
united
states
or
any
instrumentality
thereof.
”
now,
all
the
section
105
(a)
of
the
buck
act
does
is
to
put
a
federal
enclave
on
the
same
footing
as
the
normal
territory
of
a
state
with
respect
to
the
imposition
of
the
tax,
in
other
words
--
or
say
the
specified
tax.
in
other
words,
the
government
--
a
tax
payer
cannot
say
“my
transaction
took
place
in
the
federal
enclave.
that
is
not
a
sufficient
defense
after
congress
passed
the
buck
act.
but
what
congress
did
simultaneously
and
the
hearings
are
replete
with
testimony
from
people
who
came
forward
and
were
afraid
that
congress
was
about
to
whittle
away
at
the
constitutional
doctrines
long
expounded
by
this
court
as
early
as
chief
justice
marshall,
that
federal
instrumentalities
might
be
in
danger.
so
congress
enacted
section
107
to
reaffirm
that
doctrine
of
--
that
which
goes
back
m’culloch
versus
maryland
that
the
states
cannot
impose
a
tax
upon
federal
instrumentalities.
now,
if
we
are
right
as
we
submit
we
are,
that
the
tax,
the
legal
incidence
of
tax
falls
upon
the
federal
instrumentality,
then
the
buck
act
supplies
no
congressional
consent
because
section
107
(a)
of
the
buck
act
constitutes
an
explicit
reservation
by
congress
and
reaffirmation
of
the
protection
that
fellow
instrumentalities
are
supposed
to
have
from
state
taxation.
now,
turning
to
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
bases,
there
are
different
considerations
that
are
applied
because
here,
we
have
--
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
applicable.
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
bases
over
which
the
united
states
and
mississippi
exercise
simultaneous
sovereignty
are
part
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
but
we
also
have
a
competing
constitutional
doctrine
here.
we
have
the
doctrine
of
federal
tax
immunity
which
i
just
deluded
to
as,
you
know,
expressed
in
section
107
(a)
of
the
buck
act.
now,
we
submit
that
nothing
in
the
history
or
the
terms
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
suggest
that
there
were
supposed
to
be
an
exception
for
alcoholic
beverages
with
respect
to
the
federal
tax
immunity
doctrine.
the
legislative
history
and
the
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
congress
by
its
sponsors
specifically
make
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
was
not
to
alter
the
fundamental
principles
of
federalism
upon
which
the
nation
was
founded.
what
we
have
here
is
simply
a
design
of
congress
to
give
back
to
the
states
control
over
liquor
which
the
federal
government
had
preempted
during
the
period
of
prohibition.
now
the
court
has
had
on
previous
occasion’s
two
opportunities
which
we
think
are
instructive
here
to
balance
the
policy
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
when
it
conflicts
with
other
provisions
of
the
constitution.
the
two
cases
to
which
we
make
reference
to
in
our
brief
are
the
hostetter
versus
idlewild
bon
voyage
corporation
case
and
the
department
of
revenue
versus
james
beam
company
case.
those
cases,
decided
both
on
the
same
day,
dealt
with
situations
whom
which
two
conflicting
provisions
of
the
constitution
collided
so
to
speak.
now,
in
hostetter
what
you
had
essentially
was
the
state
of
new
york
had
attempted
to
shut
down
an
airport
liquor
retailer
which
sold
liquor
to
departing
international
passengers.
the
state
of
new
york
attempted
to
do
this,
grounded
its
regulatory
authority
that
the
establishment
was
unlicensed
and
unlicensable
on
the
twenty-first
amendment.
now,
the
retailer
though
on
the
other
hand
pointed
to
the
fact
that
he
was
engaged
in
international
commerce,
and
that
the
commerce
clause
of
article
i,
which
says
that
congress
shall
have
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states
and
between
foreign
nations
apply
and
that
that
made
the
state’s
power
subordinate
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
he
also
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
bureau
of
customs
had
licensed
him
under
the
tariff
act,
which
presumably
was
passed
by
congress
under
its
article
i
power
to
regulate
commerce
with
foreign
nations.
and
what
the
court
did
was
essentially
was
to
say
that
it
is
right
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
gives
the
states
power
over
to
regulate
liquor,
but
here
where
we
have
a
competing
consideration,
that
is
a
consideration
of
international
commerce,
the
amendment
has
to
yield.
now,
to
the
extent
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
indicates
if
twenty-first
amendment
is
to
have
any
impact
at
all,
it
is
in
the
impact
of
commerce,
because
it’s
supposed
to
lessen
whatever
potential
commerce
clause
problems
might
be
applicable.
but
even
so,
the
court
felt
that
the
competing
considerations
of
international
commerce
required
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
be
subordinated.
now,
we
think
that
that
case
--
that
this
case
is
--
would
seem
to
follow
a
fortiori
because
we’re
not
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
commerce
clause
is
even
remotely
applicable.
what
we’re
dealing
with
here
is
article
vi
of
the
supremacy
clause
upon
which
this
court
has
announced
in
unbroken
line
of
decision
saying
that
because
this
constitution
is
the
supreme
law
of
the
land,
the
united
states
cannot
be
subject
to
the
taxation
by
states.
now
the
james
beam
company
case
is
really
just
offers
another
example
of
that
sort
of
thing.
james
--
the
tax
involved
was
a
kentucky
tax
on
state
liquor
--
on
the
importation
of
scotch
whiskey,
and
that
conflicted
with
the
export-import
clause.
again,
the
court
subordinated
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
the
export-import
clause.
and
we
would
suggest
that
similarly,
the
twenty-first
amendment
with
respect
to
the
concurrent
jurisdiction
bases
be
subordinated
to
the
federal
tax
immunity
doctrine.
i
would
like
to
save
the
--
my
remaining
time
unless
there
are
other
questions?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
just
have
a
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
not
necessarily.
we
have
other
arguments.
we
have
an
argument
that
the
tax
is
imposed
--
affects
a
discrimination
against
the
united
states
that’s
covered
in
our
brief.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
essentially,
what
its
--
point
of
it
is,
is
that
if
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
is
on
the
wholesaler,
assuming
arguendo,
then
you
have
a
situation
where
the
wholesaler
is
told
by
the
state
of
mississippi
“if
you
sell
to
us
the
state,
you
don’t
have
to
pay
any
tax.
if
you
sell
to
the
government,
you’ve
got
to
pay
a
tax.”
now,
the
court
has
held
in
phillips
versus
dumas
school
district
and
moses
lake
homes
that
that
you
can
not
levy
a
tax
which
is
discriminatory
against
those
with
whom
the
government
deals.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
that
issue
was
addressed
below
mr.
chief
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
was
not
discreetly
briefed
in
the
way
that
i’ve
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
it
was.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
look
at
page
36
(a)
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
of
the
district
court
opinion,
he
says
here
at
the
end
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
“there
being
no
discrimination
against
the
federal
government
within
the
state’s
tax
scheme.”
and
if
you
look
at
this
footnote,
the
district
court
was
aware
of
these
cases,
but
felt
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
yes
absolutely.
i
mean,
this
is
an
extraordinary
situation
where
the
state
of
mississippi
is
telling
the
federal
government
“you
have
to
buy
a
commodity
at
a
price
that
we
are
setting,
and
in
any
event,
we
are
also
going
to
tell
--
we’ll
limit
your
sources
of
supply.”
if
you
look
at
page
63
of
the
appendix,
the
state
of
mississippi
alcoholic
beverage
control
division
wrote
a
letter
to
all
vendors
which
said
“the
choice
is
granted
to
the
purchaser
purchasing
direct
from
distiller”
and
they
are
underlining
“or
from
the
alcoholic
beverage
control
division
of
the
state
tax
commission,
purchases
are
not
to
be
placed
with
any
other
source.”
this
is
an
extraordinary
situation
where
the
state
--
a
state
is
telling
the
federal
government
that
its
choice
with
respect
to
buying
commodity
is
to
be
limited
in
terms
of
source
and
as
well
as
in
terms
of
price.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
you
can’t
do
it.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
sure,
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
you
know,
i
would
simply
suggest
that
you
know,
that
this
is
really
almost
a
concomitant
of
the
doctrine
that
the
federal
government
is
immune
from
state
taxation.
the
federal
government
has
to
function
in
a
way
which
is
free
from
interference
by
state.
i
mean
the
court
has
held
that
within
non-liquor
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
would
suggest
the
twenty-first
amendment
has
some
relevance.
you
cannot
make
an
assertion
like
that
without
considering
the
twenty-first
amendment.
but
i
think
that
the
policy
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
that
is
to
police
the
morals
of
civilian
population.
i
don’t
think
are
applicable
here
with
the
military
subjects
its
service
personnel
to
rigid
discipline
and
ensures
to
the
best
of
its
ability
that
these
commodities
which
come
in,
including
alcoholic
beverages,
will
not
be
diverted
to
the
civilian
population.
i
don’t
have
anything
else
to
say.
