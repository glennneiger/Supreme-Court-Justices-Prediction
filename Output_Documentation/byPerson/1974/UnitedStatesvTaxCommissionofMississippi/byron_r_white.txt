justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
this
case
had
come
here
from
the
state
court
of
mississippi?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
legal
incidence
matter
is
a
federal
constitutional
law
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
wouldn’t
have
to
construe,
take
the
construction
of
the
mississippi
court
as
to
wiggle
into.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
terms
of
the
question
i
asked
there’s
no
difference
between
the
federal
court
and
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
instrumentally
argument
is
the
same,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
none
of
the
regulation
tell
it
--
doesn’t
the
regulation
tell
the
distiller
to
collect
a
certain
markup?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
is
supposed
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he’s
also
supposed
to
collect
it
from
his
purchasers?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
if
the
state
wrote
a
letter
to
the
purchaser
and
said
“pay
me
the
tax.
”
a
purchaser
under
the
law
and
i
should
say
“i
don’t
owe
you
anything.”
justice
byron
r.
white
just
borrow
a
tank
when
you
get
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
you
separately
argue
that
it
would
violate
the
federal
policy,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that’s
--
you
think
that
argument
goes
before
the
concurrent
jurisdictional
bases?
