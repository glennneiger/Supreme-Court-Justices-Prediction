we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
74-548,
united
states
against
mississippi.
mr.
smith,
you
may
proceed
when
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
smith.
mr.
wright?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wright,
suppose
taking
the
hypothetical
case
that
mr.
justice
powell
suggested,
suppose
the
state
did
that
and
then
the
response
of
the
united
states
was
that
they
would
load
a
hundred
trucks
with
all
the
supplies
they
needed
including
replacement
shoes
and
ammunition
and
peanut
butter
and
what
not
along
with
vodka
and
whiskey
and
gin,
and
shipped
the
whole
thing
in,
do
you
suggest
that
mississippi
could
stop
that
shipment
and
stop
liquor
from
coming
into
a
military
base?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
assuming
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i’m
assuming
that
all
the
material
that
i
just
suggested
was
used
on
military
bases
by
military
personnel
and
not
distributed
outside
of
the
base.
and
it’s
your
position
that
mississippi
can
stop
that
inflow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no
for
use.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don’t
see
how
you
reconcile
that
with
the
express
language
of
section
107
(a)
mr.
wright?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that’s
quite
a
bit
of
--
that
covers
quite
a
bit
of
area
that
constitutional
exception?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall
when
you
said
that
they
couldn’t
levy
a
tax
on
the
sales
made
in
the
officer’s
club?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
smith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
