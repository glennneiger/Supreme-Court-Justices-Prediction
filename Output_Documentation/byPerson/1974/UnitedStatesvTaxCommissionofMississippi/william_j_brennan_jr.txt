justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
least
this
much
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
we’ve
said
is
in
the
state
--
where
the
highest
state
court
has
said,
what
the
state
statute
does
in
the
way
of
legal
instance
is
entitled
to
great
respect
nonetheless?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
considerable
weight
and
so
forth,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
i
think
it’s
implicit
and
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
were
stated
it
that
it’s
still
open.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don’t
you
might
saying
now,
what
is
the
government’s
position
as
to
the
proper
definition
for
legal
incidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
when
the
vendor
is
free
or
not
to
do
so,
then
it’s
really
only
shifting
the
economic
burden
and
doesn’t
affect
the
incidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
legal
incidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
didn’t
say
the
legal
incidence
in
king
&
boozer
was
on
the
purchaser,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wright,
did
you
say
that
the
tax
can
never
be
collected
from
the
purchaser?
it
must
be
collected
from
a
distiller
or
not
at
all?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
situation,
suppose
the
distiller
was
unable
to
collect
the
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
if
he
doesn’t
collect
it,
who
is
responsible
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
there
a
time
sequence
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
must
he
pay
it
before
he
delivers
the
liquor
to
the
purchaser?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
doesn’t
wait
to
collect
it
from
the
purchaser
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
before
he
pays
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
there’s
no
way
in
any
event
that
the
tax
can
be
collected
by
the
state,
the
statute
doesn’t
provide
for
collection
by
the
state
from
the
purchaser?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that’s
true
mr.
wright
i
guess
105
--
section
105,
but
what
about
107?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
how
expressly
it
is,
did
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
king
&
boozer
as
i
recall
it
said
that
whatever
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
panhandle
was
a
gasoline
excise
tax
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
the
seller.
and
the
issue
there
was
whether
when
the
united
states
bought
it
for
the
coast
guard,
as
i
recall
it,
and
veteran’s
hospitals
that
made
it
a
tax
on
the
united
states.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don’t
doubt
that
instead
of
being
a
tax
on
the
vendor,
had
it
been
a
tax
on
the
united
states
directly
on
its
purchases
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you’d
have
no
problem
with
that,
would
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
probably?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
probably
if
the
united
states
were
the
purchaser
under
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
what
would
be
the
case
had
the
panhandle
tax,
instead
of
being
imposed
on
the
vendor,
but
imposed
on
the
vendee,
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i’m
not
talking
about
what
that
court
would’ve
done.
what
would
be
the
--
in
the
context
of
sovereign
immunity,
what
would
be
the
answer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
guess
i’m
not
making
myself
clear
mr.
wright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
old
cases
are
cases
where
the
incidence
of
the
tax
was
on
the
vendor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i’m
talking
about
the
effort
to
impose
a
tax
directly
upon
the
united
states
as
a
purchaser.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
107,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see
you
say
at
the
military
clubs,
if
i
go
in
as
an
officer
to
purchase
a
drink?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordinarily
in
most
bars
it's
a
5%
sales
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
an
exemption
for
purchases,
i
make
at
the
bar
of
a
military
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
you
say
there’s
also
an
exemption,
you
said
a
retail
exemption
of
what
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
gallonage
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
an
excise
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there’s
an
exemption
for
that,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
only
one
they
do
collect
is
this
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
if
i’m
in
uniform,
i
could
still
get
a
cheaper
drink
at
an
officer’s
club
than
i
can
at
any
other
bar
in
mississippi?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
mr.
smith?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i’m
clear
am
i
not
that
if
the
government
is
wrong
and
the
legal
incidence
of
this
tax
is
on
the
wholesalers,
you
lose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
that
issue
of
course
wasn’t
addressed
below
because
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
the
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
i
mean
was
it
addressed
by
in
the
court
opinion
below?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
you
could
say
for
example,
if
you
want
to
truck
it
in
from
texas,
this
says
you
can't?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
despite
the
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn’t
the
twenty-first
amendment
have
relevance
to
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
also
have
for
announcement,
no.
74-548,
the
united
states
v.
state
tax
commission
of
mississippi.
regulation
25
of
the
mississippi
state
tax
commission
requires
out-of-state
liquor
distillers
and
suppliers
to
collect
from
military
installations
within
mississippi,
there
are
four
of
such
installations
in
mississippi,
and
remit
to
the
commission,
a
tax
in
the
form
of
a
wholesale
markup
of
17%
to
20%
on
liquor
sold
to
the
military
at
those
installations.
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
held
that
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
is
upon
the
out-state-liquor
dealers
and
suppliers
and
therefore
rejected
the
argument
of
the
united
states
that
the
tax
is
unconstitutional
under
the
doctrine
of
mcculloch
and
maryland
as
a
state
upon
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states.
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
since
mississippi
law
requires
that
the
out-of-state
sellers
collect
the
tax
from
the
military,
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
as
a
matter
of
law
is
upon
the
military
and
therefore
that
the
tax
is
an
unconstitutional
state
levy
upon
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states.
