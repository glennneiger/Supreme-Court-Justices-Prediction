did

justice
byron

white
well,
a
little
while
ago
you
stated
like
i
thought
that
no
injunction
was
issued,
that
no
injunction
was
denied,
now
i
take
it
you
do
feel
that
there
was
at
least
an
injunction
under
whatever
label,
whatever
guides
it
possessed
so
that
you’re
changing
the
position
a
little
bit
you
have
to,
don’t
you,
in
order
to
begin
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
view
it
as
the
injunction
i
think?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
say
i
think
you
have
to
take
this
position
to
be
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
make
the
same
argument
for
a
hundred?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
hundred
days,
a
hundred
day
suspension?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
be
in
an
expulsion?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
would
not
be
involved
in
a
hundred
days
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
feel
that
you
have
to
protect
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
think
that
--
well,
in
your
face
as
then
i
gather,
this
just
wouldn't
be
a
question
of
a
pre-suspension
hearing,
it
would
be
a
hearing
at
all?
you
would
think
that
he
could
be
terminated,
expelled,
terminated
for
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
days
without
any
hearing
at
any
time
before
or
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
what
if
you're
wrong
about
that?
there
has
to
be
a
hearing
at
some
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
acknowledge,
people
with
(inaudible)
that
they
can
--
has
events
to
new
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
in
there
and
are
they
effective?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
effective
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
were
those
that
passed
the
muster
under
the
district
court’s
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
just
don't
know
whether
they
would
have
satisfied
the
district
court
or
not?

justice

white
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio.
it
involves
the
validity
under
the
due
process
clause
having
an
ohio
statute
which
permits
the
principle
of
an
ohio
school
to
suspend
a
pupil
for
misconduct
for
up
to
10
days
without
provision
of
any
kind
for
a
hearing
either
before
or
after
the
suspension
has
taken
place.
under
this
statute,
various
students
were
suspended
for
up
to
10
days,
some
of
them
for
conduct
that
occurred
away
from
their
own
school.
the
district
court
held
that
the
students
were
denied
due
process
of
law
because
they
were
suspended
without
a
hearing
either
prior
to
suspension
or
within
a
reasonable
time
thereafter.
the
statute
was
declared
unconstitutional
and
all
references
to
the
plaintiff's
suspensions
were
ordered
removed
from
the
files.
for
the
most
part,
we
agree
with
the
district
court.
we
hold
that
the
plaintiff
students
here
involved
had
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement
to
a
public
education
and
the
school
authorities
could
not
deprive
anyone
of
them
of
that
expectation
for
more
than
a
negligible
period
of
time
without
meeting
with
him,
informing
him
of
the
charge
and
the
evidence
and
permitting
him
to
present
his
side
of
the
story.
it
is
our
view
that
these
rudimentary
requirements
are
no
more
than
the
fair-minded
school
administrator
would
have
--
in
accord
of
his
own
volition
and
that
in
any
event
they
will
provide
a
significant
hedge
against
mistaken
or
arbitrary
suspensions.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
therefore
affirmed.
