mr.

would
you
tell
us
a
little
bit
about
the
purpose
for
which
these
records
are
maintained,
are
they
made
available,
for
example,
to
some
future
potential
employer
here
or
they
maintain
only
for
internal
use
of
the
school
system?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

suppose
a
pupil
had
been
suspended,
say,
for
three
days
when
he
was
a
freshman
in
high
school
and
he
later
applied
to
a
college
and
his
high
school
transcript
was
sent
to
the
college,
would
that
three-day
suspension
appear
on
the
record?
justice
lewis
f.

do
you
known
what
they
do
send
as
a

of

does
that

right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

okay.
mr.
roos,
i'm
not
quite
clear
yet
as
to
your
position,
do
i
understand
you
say
that
any
suspension
however
brief
requires
a
prior
hearing
absent
an
emergency?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
the
teacher,
the
principal,
for
example,
could
not
send
a
student
home
for
the
last
hour
of
a
day
if
the
student
had
misbehaved
or
been
disruptive?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
roos,
under
your
submission,
is
the
age
of
the
child
or
the
grade
of
the
pupil
relevant
in
any
situation
or
putting
it
differently,
as
i
recall,
the
ages
of
these
appellees
range
let's
say
from
13
to
19,
does
the
age
make
any
difference?
does
it

yes.

may
i
ask
you
this,
is
it
your
view
that
or
does
the

support
the
view
that
a
one-day
suspension
of
a
sixth

child
would
adversely
affect
the
performance
of
that
child
in
that
grade?
justice

that's
somebody’s

is
there
any

of
it?

for
the
first
time
that
the
federal
judiciary
rather
than
state
legislatures
and
educational
officials
may
determine
the
rules
applicable
to
routine
classroom
discipline
in
public
schools.
it
justifies
this
unprecedented
intrusion
into
the
processes
of
elementary
and
secondary
education
by
identifying
a
new
constitutional
right.
the
right
of
a
student
not
to
be
suspended
for
as
much
as
a
single
day
without
notice
and
without
a
due
process
hearing
either
before
or
promptly
following
the
suspension.
only
six
years
ago
in
epperson
against
arkansas,
the
court
emphasized
that
the
public
schools
are
committed
to
the
control
by
the
state
and
local
authorities.
the
court
went
on
to
say
and
here
i
quote,
“courts
do
not
and
cannot
intervene
in
the
resolution
of
conflicts
which
arise
in
the
daily
operation
of
school
systems
and
which
do
not
directly
and
sharply
implicate
basic
constitutional
values.”
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
today
tends
its
back
on
this
and
other
similar
precedents.
it
can
hardly
be
claimed
seriously
that
a
school
principal's
decision
to
suspend
a
pupil
for
a
single
day
directly
and
sharply
implicates
basic
constitutional
values.
the
right
which
the
court
purports
to
protect
is
the
right
to
education
accorded
by
the
state
of
ohio.
the
same
ohio
law
authorizes
routine
suspensions
not
to
exceed
eight
school
days.
this
is
a
prerogative
exercised
by
school
authorities
since
the
beginning
of
education.
indeed,
the
lesson
of
discipline,
of
its
necessity
in
a
civilized
society
is
an
essential
element
of
education
itself
as
necessary
as
learning
to
read
and
write.
to
be
sure
the
process
found
today
by
the
court
to
be
due
appears
to
be
relatively
simple.
indeed,
it
may
not
afford
more
realistic
protection
against
the
occasional
arbitrary
suspension
that
ohio
law
already
provides.
but
my
concern
is
with
the
principle
and
the
precedent.
if
a
pupil
is
entitled
to
a
due
process
hearing
if
suspended
even
for
a
day,
presumably
he
also
will
be
entitled
to
such
a
hearing
on
other
discretionary
decisions
which
affect
far
more
seriously
a
state
conferred
right
to
education.
for
example,
if
given
a
failing
grade,
if
not
promoted,
if
excluded
from
certain
extracurricular
activities,
if
placed
in
the
vocational
rather
than
a
college
preparatory
track
or
indeed
if
bused
for
long
distances
away
from
his
residence.
if
the
court
perceives
a
rational
distinction
between
the
discretionary
decision
to
suspend
the
pupil
for
a
brief
period
and
the
types
of
discretionary
decisions
i
have
just
mentioned,
it
has
failed
to
articulate
any
such
distinction
in
its
opinion.
the
inevitable
result
of
today's
decision
will
be
to
substitute
in
many
situations
the
uninformed
and
inexpert
judgment
of
federal
courts
or
that
of
the
14,000
school
boards
and
2
million
public
school
teachers
who
heretofore
had
been
responsible
for
the
day
to
day
operations
of
our
public
schools.
in
short,
it
will
further
undermine
the
already
waning
authority
of
these
harassed
school
officials.
until
the
day
elected
school
boards,
teachers
and
school
authorities
having
free
to
exercise
their
informed
discretion
in
their
best
interest
of
immature
pupils
in
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
they
will
henceforth
act
at
the
peril
of
judicial
challenge
by
any
disgruntled
or
disappointed
student.
in
my
view,
the
court's
decision
is
unwarranted
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
and
it
may
well
deal
a
serious
blow
to
public
education
in
our
country.
