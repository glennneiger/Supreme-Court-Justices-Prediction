mr.
peter
d.
roos
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
a
misunderstanding
of
the
lower
court's
opinion
has
developed
in
the
questioning
of
mr.
bustin.
i
think
that
a
close
reading
of
that
opinion
would
show
that
what
the
court
did
or
say
that
a
prior
hearing
is
required
whenever
there
is
a
suspension,
except
when
there’s
an
emergency
situation.
and
when
there's
an
emergency
situation,
the
school
district
can
suspend
a
student
for
up
to
72
hours,
but
must
provide
a
subsequent
hearing.
this
was
the
position
that
was
urged
by
us
to
the
lower
court
and
we
believe
that
this
is
gist
of
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
and
this,
in
fact,
is
the
common
accommodation
and
plans
that
are
voluntarily
adopted.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
the
court
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--
did
not
engage
in
the
line
drawing
that
seemed
to
appear
in
mr.
bustin's
argument.
it
was
really
rather
a
prior
hearing
as
required
but
there
maybe
circumstances
when
there
is
intense
disruption
of
the
school
or
when
a
student
is
a
danger
to
himself
or
to
others,
that
would
justify
doing
away
with
the
prior
hearing,
but
in
that
instance,
a
hearing
must
be
provided
within
72
hours
thereafter.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
lower
court's
opinion
and
this
would
be
certainly
the
position
that
we
would
urge.
it
is
not
in
saying
that
three
days
is
--
that
a
principal
has
absolute
discretion
to
suspend
a
student
for
three
days,
what
it
is
saying
is
that
there
maybe
emergency
situations
which
may
justify
doing
away
with
the
prior
hearing.
it
is
not
saying
that
a
principal
has
an
absolute
carte
blanche
to
throw
a
kid
out
or
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
obviously,
there
has
to
be
great
reliance
upon
a
good
faith
of
school
administrators
and
then
there's
at
some
point
or
other,
it
does
boil
down
to
them.
i
might
add
however
that
various
other
school
systems
that
have
voluntarily
adopted
plans
have
build
in
mechanisms
for
assuring
that
this
isn't
a
mass
of
loophole,
for
example,
we're
informed
that
in
seattle,
for
example,
that
after
subsequent
hearing,
there
is
a
hearing
ultimately.
at
the
subsequent
hearing,
one
of
the
issues
might
be,
whether
the
emergency
suspension
procedure
was
properly
utilized.
there
are
institutional
mechanisms
for
assuring
that
this
loophole,
if
you
will,
isn't
--
just
doesn't
open
the
gates
to
absolute
discretion,
but
ultimately,
some
confidence
has
to
be
accorded
to
the
principal
in
the
belief
that
they
will
not
make
this
emergency
situation,
a
giant
loophole
and
call
every
suspension
an
emergency.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
i
think,
we
would
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
excuse
me.
there
was
testimony
by
the
chief
witness
for
the
district,
mr.
goss
as
to
how
they
function
and
if
you
give
me
one
--
that
testimony,
your
honor,
starts
at
164
and
runs
2171,
it
does
cover
more
than
how
those
newly
adopted
procedures
do
operate,
but
there
is
testimony
concerning
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
the
gist
of
it
is,
your
honor,
they
really
didn't
know
what
they
meant
and
the
gist
of
it
is
that
they
were
leaving
everything
up
to
the
principal
to
determine
whether
there
would
be
any
sort
of
meaningful
protections.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
might
i
read
just
to
give
you
a
sense
of
how
these
things
were
adopted,
question,
under
this
plan
was
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
excuse
me,
from
the
appendix
of
171,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
volume
2.
question,
under
this
plan
mr.
goss,
do
you
contemplate
that
the
pupil
will
have
the
opportunity
except
for
his
own
statements
to
the
principal
to
call
any
witnesses
in
his
own
behalf?
answer,
that
would
be
the
judgment
of
the
principal.
question,
that's
up
to
the
principal
and
not
the
student,
is
that
it?
answer,
that's
right.
so
these
guidelines
really
are
nothing
much
more
than
guidelines,
they
are
not
well
caught
out
procedures
designed
to
provide
any
degree
of
procedural
protection
for
the
student.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
they
were
developed
a
week
before
the
decision,
your
honor,
and
presented
to
the
court
on
the
day
of
the
trial.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
we
might
make
something
for
the
rest
of
the
day,
it's
a
severance
from
the
school
for
the
rest
of
the
day,
might
be
something
different
from
--
it
might
be
in
the
nature,
in
fact,
of
a
cooling
off
period.
we
would
assume
that
that
would
be
what
it
would
be--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--
so
that
it
might
be
something
different
from
a
severance
for
several
days.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
well,
your
honor,
we're
not
certain
in
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
it's
generally
our
position
that
a
severance
from
the
school
system,
putting
the
child
out
of
the
school
system
as
opposed
to
punishments
that
might
happen
internally
within
the
school
system
or
the
one-hour,
two-hour,
end-of-the-day
sort
of
thing,
something
that
is
as
final
and
as
abrupt
as
saying
you
shall
not
come
back
tomorrow
or
for
ten
days,
has
the
potential
of
creating
serious
disruptions
in
the
educational
progress
of
the
student
and
also
has
some
of
the
stigmatizing
consequences
that
were
alluded
to
before.
there
certainly
is
some
area
of
line
drawing,
and
i
cannot
deny
that
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
key
is
severance
and
--
i
think
the
key
is
severance,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
both
the
property
interest
and
a
liberty
interest
are
implicated.
under
this
court’s
rulings
in
roth,
sindermann,
bell
versus
burson,
the
statutory
entitlement
cases,
this
court
has
held
that
a
well-established
statutory
entitlement
creates
a
property
interest.
we
would
submit
that
this
court
has
probably
never
considered
such
a
historically
or
in
a
present
such
a
well-established
statutory
entitlement
as
the
right
to
a
student
to
attend
or
to
receive
public
instruction
in
ohio.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
oh,
i
think
that
under
this
court's
decision,
your
honor,
i
don't
see
how
there
can
be
any
question
of
that.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
as
i
understand
it
your
honor,
in
roth,
the
sense
was
if
the
teacher
had
had
tenure
under
state
law,
that
there
had,
in
fact
been
a
statutory
entitlement
to
continue
in
employment
or
something
other
than
a
statutory
entitlement
and
understanding
as
in
sindermann,
then
there
would
have
been
a
protected
interest
and
if
there
had
been
an
invasion,
which
obviously
a
fire
and
would
be
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
well,
i
don't
think
that
there’s
any
question
your
honor.
if
i
can
refer
to
my
brief,
we
pretty
well
set
out
the
various
constitutional
and
legislative
provisions?
mr.
peter
d.
roos
we
have
a
compulsory
attendance
law
your
honor,
but
further
than
that,
there’s
a
constitutional
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--
there's
a
constitutional
provision
that
requires
that
the
--
that
public
schools
be
established.
there
are
several
independent
legislative
requirements
that
the
local
community
set
up
schools,
that
free
public
schooling
be
available
for
children
between
certain
ages.
it's
a
pervasive,
a
very
pervasive
scheme
of
entitlements.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
in
terms
of
the
right
to
a
prior
hearing
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--
or
the
right
to
hearing
your
honor?
mr.
peter
d.
roos
i
don't
think
so.
a
child
who
is
in
elementary
school
is
just
as
needful
of
the
protections
as
is
a
child
who
is
in
a
high
school,
we're
talking
about
severance
from
the
school
system.
as
a
practical
matter
your
honor,
if
i
might,
i
had
quite
a
deal
experiencing
in
analyzing
statistics
and
what
not
on
suspensions
and
expulsions,
as
a
practical
matter,
they
very
rarely
occur
at
the
elementary
school
level,
it's
primarily
at
the
junior
high
and
the
high
school
level,
but
they
could
occur
and
under
our
analysis,
there
would
be
no
particular
reason
that
we
could
think
of
for
distinguishing
between
an
elementary
school
system
and
a
high
school
system.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
the
record
does
support
that
it
could
adversely
affect
the
child.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
there's
ample
uncontroverted
testimony
of
the
sorts
of
harms
that
can
and
do
occur
in
a
suspension.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
any
suspension
your
honor.
i
would
draw
this
court's
attention
especially
to
the
testimony
of
dr.
ree
which
starts
at
page
171,
it
is
not
long,
it
runs
to
182.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
yes,
volume
two
of
the
appendix.
the
harms
that
he
describes,
and
which
are
un-controverted,
all
could
occur
or
are
substantially
likely
to
occur
to
any
child
irrespective
of
age
and
irrespective
of
length.
now
it
is
true,
clearly
that
the
longer
an
exclusion,
the
likelihood
of
harm
or
the
magnitude
of
the
harm
may
increase.
we
would
not
argue
that
that
is
not
the
case,
but
we
do
argue
and
argue
forcefully
that
even
a
short-term
suspension
can
have
stigmatizing
consequences,
can
have
educational
consequences
and
what
not.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
there
maybe
some
situations
of
that
sort
your
honor.
we
would
submit
that
there
is
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
arrest,
i
know
that
this
court
has
mentioned.
there
is
no
reason
whatsoever
for
not
holding
a
prior
hearing
in
a
school
suspension
case.
in
an
arrest
situation
where
an
emergency
may
occur,
there
is
obviously
need
for
a
quick
action.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
well,
that
is
so
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
i
suppose
that
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
i
suppose
that
that
often
is
the
case
your
honor,
but
we
would
submit
that
that
there's
no
reason
whatsoever,
there
is
no
reason
advanced
by
our
opponents
and
there’s
no
reason
that
we
can
conjure
up
for
not
holding
some
form
of
protection
to
ensure
that
the
sorts
of
harms
that
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
and
which
are
well-documented
in
the
record
will
not
occur.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
no
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
no
question
your
honor
that
we
believe
that
a
disruptive
classroom
is
not
a
desirable
situation,
that
is
why
we
urged
the
lower
court
to
adopt
the
emergency
suspension
procedure,
absent
the
sort
of
emergency
that
is
provided
for
by
the
lower
court
decision
and
which
is
commonly
provided
for
and
adopted
in
regulations
that
are
voluntarily
adopted.
there
is
the
sort
of
disruption
that
your
envision
is
taken
care
of,
is
that
what
we're
dealing
with,
the
sorts
of
situations
that
are
not
emergencies,
that
are
not
in
some
way
interfering
substantially
with
the
rights
of
other
students
or
with
the
learning
process.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
believe
that
there
is
certainly
in
ohio
a
property
interest,
that
would
appear
to
be
a
liberty
interest
involved.
there,
in
fact,
may
even
be
a
liberty
interest
under
the
rule
of
constantineau
and
joint
anti-fascist.
if
one
reads
a
record,
one
can
get
a
very
clear
picture
of
the
sort
of
stigmatizing
and
harmful
consequences
that
can
occur
in
a
suspension,
even
a
short-term
suspension.
it’s
our
position
that
there
is
a
protected
interest.
there
is
--
i
don't
think
any
question,
an
invasion
thereof,
it
is
our
position
that
some
form
of
prior
hearing
is
appropriate.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
a
misunderstanding
of
the

developed
in
the

of

bustin.
i

the

how
these
things
were
adopted,
question,
under
this
plan
was
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
excuse
me,
from
the
appendix
of
171,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
volume
2.
question,
under
this
plan
mr.
goss,
do
you
contemplate
that
the
pupil
will
have
the
opportunity
except
for
his
own
statements
to
the
principal
to
call
any
witnesses
in
his
own
behalf?
answer,
that
would
be
the
judgment
of
the
principal.
question,
that's
up
to
the
principal
and
not
the
student,
is
that
it?
answer,
that's
right.
so
these
guidelines
really
are
nothing
much
more
than
guidelines,
they
are
not
well
caught
out
procedures
designed
to
provide
any
degree
of
procedural
protection
for
the
student.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
they
were
developed
a
week
before
the
decision,
your
honor,
and
presented
to
the
court
on
the
day
of
the
trial.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
we
might
make
something
for
the
rest
of
the
day,
it's
a
severance
from
the
school
for
the
rest
of
the
day,
might
be
something
different
from
--
it
might
be
in
the
nature,
in
fact,
of
a
cooling
off
period.
we
would
assume
that
that
would
be
what
it
would
be--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--
so
that
it
might
be
something
different
from
a
severance
for
several
days.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
well,
your
honor,
we're
not
certain
in
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
it's
generally
our
position
that
a
severance
from
the
school
system,
putting
the
child
out
of
the
school
system
as
opposed
to
punishments
that
might
happen
internally
within
the
school
system
or
the
one-hour,
two-hour,
end-of-the-day
sort
of
thing,
something
that
is
as
final
and
as
abrupt
as
saying
you
shall
not
come
back
tomorrow
or
for
ten
days,
has
the
potential
of
creating
serious
disruptions
in
the
educational
progress
of
the
student
and
also
has
some
of
the
stigmatizing
consequences
that
were
alluded
to
before.
there
certainly
is
some
area
of
line
drawing,
and
i
cannot
deny
that
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
the
key
is
severance
and
--
i
think
the
key
is
severance,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
both
the
property
interest
and
a
liberty
interest
are
implicated.
under
this
court’s
rulings
in
roth,
sindermann,
bell
versus
burson,
the
statutory
entitlement
cases,
this
court
has
held
that
a
well-established
statutory
entitlement
creates
a
property
interest.
we
would
submit
that
this
court
has
probably
never
considered
such
a
historically
or
in
a
present
such
a
well-established
statutory
entitlement
as
the
right
to
a
student
to
attend
or
to
receive
public
instruction
in
ohio.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
oh,
i
think
that
under
this
court's
decision,
your
honor,
i
don't
see
how
there
can
be
any
question
of
that.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
as
i
understand
it
your
honor,
in
roth,
the
sense
was
if
the
teacher
had
had
tenure
under
state
law,
that
there
had,
in
fact
been
a
statutory
entitlement
to
continue
in
employment
or
something
other
than
a
statutory
entitlement
and
understanding
as
in
sindermann,
then
there
would
have
been
a
protected
interest
and
if
there
had
been
an
invasion,
which
obviously
a
fire
and
would
be
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
well,
i
don't
think
that
there’s
any
question
your
honor.
if
i
can
refer
to
my
brief,
we
pretty
well
set
out
the
various
constitutional
and
legislative
provisions?
mr.
peter
d.
roos
we
have
a
compulsory
attendance
law
your
honor,
but
further
than
that,
there’s
a
constitutional
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--
there's
a
constitutional
provision
that
requires
that
the
--
that
public
schools
be
established.
there
are
several
independent
legislative
requirements
that
the
local
community
set
up
schools,
that
free
public
schooling
be
available
for
children
between
certain
ages.
it's
a
pervasive,
a
very
pervasive
scheme
of
entitlements.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
in
terms
of
the
right
to
a
prior
hearing
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
--
or
the
right
to
hearing
your
honor?
mr.
peter
d.
roos
i
don't
think
so.
a
child
who
is
in
elementary
school
is
just
as
needful
of
the
protections
as
is
a
child
who
is
in
a
high
school,
we're
talking
about
severance
from
the
school
system.
as
a
practical
matter
your
honor,
if
i
might,
i
had
quite
a
deal
experiencing
in
analyzing
statistics
and
what
not
on
suspensions
and
expulsions,
as
a
practical
matter,
they
very
rarely
occur
at
the
elementary
school
level,
it's
primarily
at
the
junior
high
and
the
high
school
level,
but
they
could
occur
and
under
our
analysis,
there
would
be
no
particular
reason
that
we
could
think
of
for
distinguishing
between
an
elementary
school
system
and
a
high
school
system.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
your
honor,
the
record
does
support
that
it
could
adversely
affect
the
child.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
there's
ample
uncontroverted
testimony
of
the
sorts
of
harms
that
can
and
do
occur
in
a
suspension.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
any
suspension
your
honor.
i
would
draw
this
court's
attention
especially
to
the
testimony
of
dr.
ree
which
starts
at
page
171,
it
is
not
long,
it
runs
to
182.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
yes,
volume
two
of
the
appendix.
the
harms
that
he
describes,
and
which
are
un-controverted,
all
could
occur
or
are
substantially
likely
to
occur
to
any
child
irrespective
of
age
and
irrespective
of
length.
now
it
is
true,
clearly
that
the
longer
an
exclusion,
the
likelihood
of
harm
or
the
magnitude
of
the
harm
may
increase.
we
would
not
argue
that
that
is
not
the
case,
but
we
do
argue
and
argue
forcefully
that
even
a
short-term
suspension
can
have
stigmatizing
consequences,
can
have
educational
consequences
and
what
not.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
there
maybe
some
situations
of
that
sort
your
honor.
we
would
submit
that
there
is
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
arrest,
i
know
that
this
court
has
mentioned.
there
is
no
reason
whatsoever
for
not
holding
a
prior
hearing
in
a
school
suspension
case.
in
an
arrest
situation
where
an
emergency
may
occur,
there
is
obviously
need
for
a
quick
action.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
well,
that
is
so
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
i
suppose
that
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
i
suppose
that
that
often
is
the
case
your
honor,
but
we
would
submit
that
that
there's
no
reason
whatsoever,
there
is
no
reason
advanced
by
our
opponents
and
there’s
no
reason
that
we
can
conjure
up
for
not
holding
some
form
of
protection
to
ensure
that
the
sorts
of
harms
that
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief
and
which
are
well-documented
in
the
record
will
not
occur.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
no
--
mr.
peter
d.
roos
no
question
your
honor
that
we
believe
that
a
disruptive
classroom
is
not
a
desirable
situation,
that
is
why
we
urged
the
lower
court
to
adopt
the
emergency
suspension
procedure,
absent
the
sort
of
emergency
that
is
provided
for
by
the
lower
court
decision
and
which
is
commonly
provided
for
and
adopted
in
regulations
that
are
voluntarily
adopted.
there
is
the
sort
of
disruption
that
your
envision
is
taken
care
of,
is
that
what
we're
dealing
with,
the
sorts
of
situations
that
are
not
emergencies,
that
are
not
in
some
way
interfering
substantially
with
the
rights
of
other
students
or
with
the
learning
process.
mr.
peter
d.
roos
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
believe
that
there
is
certainly
in
ohio
a
property
interest,
that
would
appear
to
be
a
liberty
interest
involved.
there,
in
fact,
may
even
be
a
liberty
interest
under
the
rule
of
constantineau
and
joint
anti-fascist.
if
one
reads
a
record,
one
can
get
a
very
clear
picture
of
the
sort
of
stigmatizing
and
harmful
consequences
that
can
occur
in
a
suspension,
even
a
short-term
suspension.
it’s
our
position
that
there
is
a
protected
interest.
there
is
--
i
don't
think
any
question,
an
invasion
thereof,
it
is
our
position
that
some
form
of
prior
hearing
is
appropriate.
