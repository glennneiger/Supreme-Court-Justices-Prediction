mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
originates
as
in
a
direct
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
ohio.
during
the
early
months
of
1971,
in
the
columbus
school
district
in
columbus,
ohio,
several
of
the
schools
located
in
that
district
experienced
a
series
of
internal
student
disruptions
and
the
type
involving
fighting
among
students,
blocking
of
hallways
and
stairways,
questions
surrounding
the
setting
of
several
fires
in
one
of
the
school
building.
one
of
the
schools
had
to
be
closed
for
a
period
of
time
trying
to
bring
order
back,
open
defiance
of
the
type
characterized
when
a
principal
was
speaking
to
one
of
the
assembled
classes,
one
of
the
students
got
up
and
told
the
principal
that
they
were
all
done
listening
to
him
that
he
would
now
listen
to
them
and
they
were
going
to
tell
him
how
it
was
going
to
be
run.
from
that
pattern
of
internal
disruption,
there
occurred
a
series
of
temporary
suspensions
from
anywhere
from
five
to
ten
days
arising
under
a
statute
section
3313.66
of
the
ohio
revised
code,
which
allowed
a
principal
to
temporarily
suspend
for
a
period
of
one
to
ten
days
without
holding
a
formal
hearing.
the
statute
required
the
principal
or
administrative
official
to
send
a
notification
to
the
parents
and
to
the
school
department
of
the
fact
that
the
suspension.
the
statute
also
contained
a
provision
which
in
the
case
of
expulsion,
required
that
the
parents
where
expulsion
was
going
to
take
place,
could
appeal
that
action
to
the
board
of
education
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
child
should
be
expelled
would
be
heard
by
the
columbus
board
of
education.
following
this
pattern
of
temporary
suspensions,
a
1983
civil
rights
action
was
instituted
in
which
the
section
i've
just
discussed
was
challenged
as
being
unconstitutional
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
due
process
clause
and
it
was
also
alleged
that
it
was
vague
and
overbroad
in
its
provisions.
following
the
conclusion
of
a
trial,
a
three-judge
district
court
concluded
in
its
opinion
that
the
statutory
section
and
the
regulations
implementing
the
statute
in
the
school
were,
in
fact,
unconstitutional
as
being
violative
of
the
due
process
clause.
the
court
concluded
that
the
statute
was
not
vague
or
overbroad
in
its
provisions.
in
ohio,
in
the
structuring
of
the
school
system,
the
ohio
constitution
directs
that
the
legislature
is
to
use
public
funds
to
establish
a
common
system
of
schools
and
also
gives
the
legislature
power
in
the
area
of
organization,
administration
and
control
of
that
particular
school
system
that
is
set
up.
in
this
particular
statute,
i
mentioned
is
one
of
that
series
of
statutory
scheme
which
sets
up
and
controls
the
common
system
of
schools
in
ohio.
it's
appellants
position
in
this
particular
case
in
analyzing
what's
involved
and
in
discussing
the
interest
of
the
school.
what’s
really
involved
in
this
whole
case
is
not
really
the
temporary
suspensions
themselves,
but
really
a
question
of
what
power
the
states
and
local
school
districts
will
have
to
structure
their
particular
school
systems.
and
when
i
use
the
term
“structure,”
i
mean,
make
decisions
with
respect
to
not
only
how
the
process
will
go
on,
who
will
be
the
teachers,
how
it
will
be
managed
and
what
form
of
academic
discipline
will
be
utilized
in
the
particular
system.
it’s
our
position
that
this
is
really
the
important
question
here
before
this
court.
in
ohio,
academic
discipline
is
viewed
by
the
ohio
courts
anyway,
as
being
part
and
parcel
of
the
educational
process,
that
has
been
so
held
in
the
lauper
(ph)
case
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
it's
our
position
that
the
legislature
in
this
particular
case,
given
the
type
of
area
concerned
that
they
were
involved
with,
i.e.,
the
educational
process,
wherein
you're
faced
with
entirely
different
types
of
interests
that
you
find
in
other
commons
areas
and
i
say
that
from
this
standpoint.
when
you're
trying
to
structure
a
school
system,
a
very
important
question
is,
the
type
of
relationship
that
the
state
and
carry
it
down
further,
the
local
school
districts
would
like
to
see
established
in
their
particular
district.
i
think
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes.
i
mean,
the
type
of
relationship
that
will
exist
in
the
ongoing
process
between
the
teacher,
a
student
and
a
principal,
while
the
student
is
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
not
on
a
day-by-day
basis,
but
i
think,
this
all
works
into
the
very
process
of
formulating
what
type
of
academic
discipline
is
going
to
take
place
in
the
particular
school.
viewed
in
that
context,
i
think,
the
states
must
retain
a
certain
degree
of
discretion,
if
you
will,
to
decide
for
themselves,
whether
or
not
they
will
have
academic
discipline
and
what
the
form
of
that
academic
discipline
will
be.
it's
our
position
that
based
on
a
much
similar
analogy
as
was
contained
in
the
linwood
case
that
a
legislature
that
legislates
as
it
has
done
in
this
particular
case,
which
is
in
a
restrictive
sense,
restricting
the
authority
of
the
principal
really,
from
having
a
--
what
i
would
class
as
a
carte
blanche
authority
to
discipline,
cutting
down
his
authority
to
a
period
of
a
one
to
ten
days
without
requiring
a
hearing,
while
at
the
same
time
requiring
one
or
utilizing
one
where
a
situation
is
in
expulsion
that
a
legislature
does
act
within
the
framework
of
the
type
of
discretionary
authority.
i
think,
this
court
has
talked
about
in
repeated
cases
where
it
has
been
mentioned
that
local
school
authorities
should
retain
a
great
deal
of
latitude
and
discretion
in
the
daily
management
of
their
particular
internal
affairs
of
the
school
districts.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no
injunction
was
issued
in
this
particular
case.
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
found
the
statute
and
the
regulations
unconstitutional
and
directed
the
board
of
education
and
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
and
we're
appealing.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
believe,
you
do.
of
course,
made
a
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes,
we
did.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no
injunction
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
is
not
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
there
was
really
no
orderly
hearing
on
an
injunction
at
any
point.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
the
court
left
that
kind
of
as
i
believe
in
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
is
a
direct
appeal
under
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
yeah.
there
is
no
mention
of
it
in
the
opinion
that
the
court
handed
down
all
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
we
opposed
the
injunction
from
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
if
the
court
says
--
i
won
from
the
standpoint
that
the
court
did
not
grant
one.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
the
court
required
us
to
expunge
from
the
records
of
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes,
that's
what
i
was
getting
to.
apart
from
finding
the
statute
invalid,
the
court
directed
us
to
expunge
from
the
records
of
the
pupils
involved
in
this
particular
class
action.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
the
court
did
not
specifically
label
it
an
injunction
that
they
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
--
did
require
us
to
expunge
from
the
records
of
these
people
involved
in
this
class
action.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes,
they
set
up
the
system
that
they
found
would
be
a
proper
type
of
system
to
utilize
where
a
temporary
suspension
was
going
to
take
place.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
i'm
saying
there's
not
a
label
attached
to,
but
the
court
did
mandate
us
in
a
sense
to
expunge
from
the
records
of
these
people
involved
--
any
reference
to
a
suspension
arising
out
of
this
period
of
time,
which
gave
rise
to
litigation
in
that
sense
that
you
need
an
injunction.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
pardon?
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
wholeheartedly
agree
that
in
that
sense
i
view
it
a
as
mandate
to
the
board
of
education
and
the
principles
involved.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
would
view
that
as
a
--
an
injunctive
type
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
for
the
purposes
of
your
jurisdiction.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
the
district
court
set
up
a
formula,
if
you
will,
of
how
we
were
supposed
to
handle
temporary
suspension,
saying
in
part
that
we
could
temporarily
suspend
without
a
hearing
for
a
period
of
three
days,
but
after
that
we
had
a
procedure
that
we
had
to
go
through.
so
in
that
sense
they
did
restrict,
i
think,
place
a
restriction
on
this
relationship
that
i'm
talking
about
that
i
think
the
columbus
school
district
sought
to
foster
in
its
system
and
that
is
one
of
the
discipline
being
part
and
parcel
of
the
educational
process.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
in
the
record
of
this
cause,
in
the
deposition
of
the
superintendent
of
schools
it
was
taken,
it
was
explained
that
these
records
are
not
made
generally
available
to
everyone
and
that
when
an
employer,
for
example,
calls
in
and
wants
information
about
the
student,
he
is
given
basic
information
pertaining
to
whether
his
grades,
in
whether
or
not
he
graduated
from
the
school,
that
the
records
are
not
open
for
ready
examination.
it
is
also
explained
in
that
testimony
of
the
superintendent
that
even
where
--
that
the
focus
of
their
information
they
try
to
provide
for
his
graduation
and
grades
and
also
test
where
they’ve
taken
psychological
tests
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
in
this
particular
record,
looking
at
the
transcripts,
it
could
show,
yes,
if
that
whole
format,
folder,
if
you
will,
that
they
utilized
was
sent
to
the
college.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
as
i
believe
the
superintendent's
testimony
was
more
in
the
nature
of
trying
to
provide
grades
and
grades
from
schooling
process
and
all
grades
in
the
psychological
test,
that
type
of
information,
and
as
other
is
requested.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes,
it
appears
in
the
appendix,
in
the
testimony
of
superintendent
ellis.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
this
was
the
policy
of
the
columbus
school
district.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no
it
was
not
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
it
was
not
the
policy
--
explained
as
being
the
policy
of
that
superintendent,
it
was
a
policy
of
the
district.
he
was
explaining
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
--
what
they
did
in
the
district.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
is
not
written
down
as
such.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
the
regulations
explained
to
the
principals
and
the
teachers,
the
process
was
that
the
records
would
not
be
circulated,
would
not
be
open
for
a
ready
examination.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
is
in
the
--
the
only
regulation
i
can
point
to
is
the
--
in
the
administrative
guide
so
to
speak
when
they
talk
about
it
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
when
they
talk
in
the
--
i
believe,
that's
in
volume
3
around
page
280,
it's
where
this
administrative
guide
is
discussed,
that
and
the
superintendent's
testimony.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
can’t
say
that
this
record
--
i
can’t
say
that
this
record
candidly
says
in
writing
that
it
will
not
be
circulated.
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
principal
explained
that
each
--
at
the
time,
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
and
in
the
operation
of
the
school,
each
principal
and
other
administrative
official
has
directed,
not
to
release
this
type
of
information.
that’s
the
type
of
testimony
that
appears
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
think,
the
board
--
no,
i
think
the
columbus
board
of
education
would
have
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it's
not
in
writing,
in
this
particular
record.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor,
not
in
the
posture
of
the
record
as
it
appears
before
this
court.
however,
i
fail
to
see
the
significance
of
the
record
showing
the
three-day
suspension,
if
you
will,
we
view
the
three-day
suspension
as
being
part
and
parcel
of
the
education
process.
it's
really
no
different
when
the
school
official
is
looking
at
any
particular
person's
record,
if
you
will,
and
they
see
on
that
record,
the
fact
that
the
person
has
flunked
mathematics.
i
think
that
the
college
or
employer
looking
at
that
particular
record
is
going
to
be
as
much
influenced
by
the
grade
that
that
individual
has
received
in
mathematics,
for
example,
as
he
is
by
what
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
have
no
individual
experience,
i
think.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor,
the
three-judge
court,
all
they
did
was
required
us
or
mandate
us
to
expunge
these
references
to
the
disciplinary
transfers
and
suspensions
from
their
records.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
they
went
no
further
than
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
if
as
mr.
justice
marshall
said,
the
record
is
made
readily
available
to
any
employer
and
he
does,
in
fact,
see
that,
yes,
it
would
be
there.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
under
the
statute,
before
it
was
declared
unconstitutional,
he
would
not
have
that
authority.
in
other
words
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
as
i
view
the
statute
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
--as
a
restrictive
statute
and
has
been
so
viewed
in
ohio
as
a
restrictive
statute.
his
authority
to
act
as
principal
could
not
be
an
action
beyond
one
to
ten
days
for
the
case
--.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
that
as
i
read
the
statute
and
interpret
it,
yes.
if
he
did
so,
he
would
be
acting
like
classified
ultra
vires,
outside
of
his
authority
and
the
superintendent
testifies
it.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
under
that
statute.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
i
view
the
statute
as
a
restrictive
statute
which
i
think
the
legislature
sought
to
draw
down
his
authority.
there
is
another
statute
which
talks
about
the
management
and
control
of
the
schools
in
section
33,
i
think,
it's
4720,
they're
both
cited
in
the
brief,
but
it
talks
in
very
general
terms
and
i
think
here
the
legislature
sought
to
further
restrict
that
authority
so
that
he
could
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
the
expulsion
is
not
defined
as
a
definition
in
the
code
that
sets
up
the
common
school
system.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
could
be
--
i
think
a
legislature
could
categorize
expulsion.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
not
that
i
can
find
in
this
particular--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
even
in
the
sense
of
the
ohio
situation,
i
don't
even
think
they
view
expulsion
as
being
permanently
out
of
the
school
or
forever.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it's
the
way
the
statute
reads,
it's
a
removal
from
the
school
for
the
remainder
of
the
school
term
which
may
even
be
30
days.
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i've
been
able
to
find
--
i've
searched
hard
to
find
any
ohio
cases
which
have
directly
taken
up
this
particular
statute
and
the
closest
thing
i
can
come
to
in
any
sense
was
a
case
in
state
fleetwood
in
20
ohio
appellate
second,
but
that
was
not
to
the
constitutional
nature
of
the
statute
itself,
it
just
has
not
been
treated
in
that
context
by
ohio
courts.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
they
seem
to
be
going
off
as
i
view
it,
the
only
way
i
can
view
it
is
the
difference
between
three
and
ten
days
that
they
seem
to
view
three
day
as
okay,
but
a
period
of
ten
days
as
violating
due
process.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
for
a
hundred?
under
my
analysis
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
under
my
analysis,
in
this
particular
case
as
i've
set
forth
in
my
brief,
while
expulsion
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
i
would
have
to
say
that
a
right
of
liberty
of
property
would
not
be
involved
where
the
person
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
so,
under
my
analysis.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
feel
that
the
position
in
light
of
the
roth
case,
for
example,
and
also
the
cafeteria
workers
case
follows
that
the
student
who
is
removed
from
the
process,
as
you
used
for
a
hundred
days,
is
in
no
worse
position
than
the
non-tenure
teacher
who
is
only
told
that
he
is
non-renewed,
but
where
this
district
does
not
say
to
every
other
district
in
ohio,
for
example,
don't
bother
with
this
child,
stops
and
closes
every
door
to
him
and
i
see
student
in
your
hundred-day
situation
being
in
much
the
same
posture.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
as
i've
analyzed
the
constitution
in
this
sense,
i
believe
that
i
would
have
to
answer
a
yes
to
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
down
to
in
that
posture
drawing
lines
and
i
raised
any
question
of
where
will
we
stop
and
i
can
come
back
to
my
situation
of
--
do
we
go
to
a
hearing
process
where
a
person
is
receiving
a
grade
or
something
of
that
similar
nature.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes
and
i
might
have
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes,
in
my
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
believe,
it
fits
in
to
the
doctrine
of
the
ohio
discipline
inculcating
self-disciplinary
respect
for
a
30
days
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
process
and
i
think
a
legislature
that
does
this,
a
legislature
as
it
has
done
here
with
this
statute,
it
doesn't
seem
to--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
as
i
read
the
record
and
have
analyzed
the
record,
i
believe
that
the
record
does
not
disclose
that
the
particular
suspensions
involved
in
this
case
really
had
any
effect
on
the
outcome
of
their
proceeding
through
the
process.
for
example,
one
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
believe
that
should
be
a
question
for
the
state
legislature
to
decide
whether
they
want
to?
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
they
could
very
well
use
their
time
in
some
other
pursuit,
for
example,
they
might
have
received
training
in
a
vocational
endeavor
or
maybe
working
with
somebody
in
the
outside.
it
may
not
be
waste,
i
think.
that's
up
to
the
individual
how
he
utilizes
that
additional
time.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
they
could
very
well
do
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
i
don't
think
you
can
engage
in
that
kind
of
speculation.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor,
i
cannot.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
believe
it
disrupts
the
very
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
believe
it
disrupts
the
very
process
i've
been
talking
about
and
the
relationship
i've
been
talking
about,
that
the
school
system
seeks
to
foster.
i
believe
that
you
say
that
a
three-day
rule
and
go
beyond
that,
there
must
be
a
hearing,
but
right
away
you've
been
injected
into
the
relationship
at
least
a
quasi-judicial
type
of
adversary
relationship.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no
it
doesn't.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
doesn't
--
it
says
you
can't
go
beyond
the
ten
days.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
it
doesn't
limit,
the
school
board
in
ohio
is
a
political
subdivision,
if
you
will.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
hasn't
taken
the
power
away
from
them.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
think,
to
me
an
expulsion
characterizes
something
where
the
district
or
school
says
to
pupil,
in
essence,
we
want
to
remove
you
from
the
school
on
a
permanent
type
basis.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
not
more
than
ten
days.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
think
it's
important
to
the
system
in
the
relationship
that
the
district
tries
to
establish
in
that
system.
it
is
important
that
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
specifically,
because
i
think
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
pardon?
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
not
because
i
like
it,
i
think
it's
because
the
legislature
wants
to
have
the
principal
and
his
relationship
with
the
student,
have
a
broad
range
of
authority
here
--
limited
authority
protect
not
only
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
--
few
individuals
but
the
entire
school
as
a
whole.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think,
it's
this
type
of
line
drawing
that
we're
engaging
in
gets
into
this
type
of
problem.
i
think
that's
a
line
that
should
be
drawn
by
the
legislative
body
if
they
still
have
any
kind
of
discretionary
authority.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
it
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
you
could
be
looking
at
it
in
the
face
of
this
record
and
say
that
in
a
sense,
because
here
the
principal
that
is
portrayed
in
the
testimony
of
the
principal
fulton,
when
he
handed
out
the
suspension,
he
was
trying
to
restore
order
so
that
the
vast
bulk
of
students
could
get
on
with
the
process
of
day-to-day
learning.
so,
i
think,
you
could
characterize
it
in
a
sense
as
a
cooling
off
period.
also
from
this
sense,
the
principal
tries
to,
during
his
period
and
is
portrayed
in
his
testimony
also,
meet
with
the
student
and
his
parents
and
discuss
the
student's
entire
school
record
with
the
emphasis
on
trying
to
find
out
what
the
student’s
problem
is
and
how
they
can
get
that
student
progressing
again.
so
in
that
sense
i
would
--
you
could
characterize
it
as
a
cooling
off
period.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
gets
down
to,
i
believe
here,
your
honor,
gets
down
around
starting
on
page
from
60
over
to
64
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
in
the
back,
yeah,
and
on
page
63,
it
gets
into
in
more
detail.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
i
view
this
decision,
entire
decision
as
being
open
to
review
by
this
court,
i
think
they
probably
could
argue
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
drawing
its
line
to
three
days
and
possibly
should
be
one
or
even
less
than
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
there
is
a
new
procedure
that
the
--
let's
say
a
new
procedure,
new
guidelines,
if
you
will,
that
the
board
sat
down
--
it's
contained
on
page
25
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
they
are
in
effect.
when
i
say
guidelines
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
--
it's
an
operational
procedure
that
the
principals
are
told
how
they
will
operate
under
the
particular
statute.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i'm
not
at
all
sure.
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
sloughed
them
off.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
can't
really
say
it,
it
sloughed
them
off
in
a
footnote
as
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
originates
as
in
a
direct
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
ohio.
during
the
early
months
of
1971,
in
the
columbus
school
district
in
columbus,
ohio,
several
of
the
schools
located
in
that
district
experienced
a
series
of
internal
student
disruptions
and
the
type
involving
fighting
among
students,
blocking
of
hallways
and
stairways,
questions
surrounding
the
setting
of
several
fires
in
one
of
the
school
building.
one
of
the
schools
had
to
be
closed
for
a
period
of
time
trying
to
bring
order
back,
open
defiance
of
the
type
characterized
when
a
principal
was
speaking
to
one
of
the
assembled
classes,
one
of
the
students
got
up
and
told
the
principal
that
they
were
all
done
listening
to
him
that
he
would
now
listen
to
them
and
they
were
going
to
tell
him
how
it
was
going
to
be
run.
from
that
pattern
of
internal
disruption,
there
occurred
a
series
of
temporary
suspensions
from
anywhere
from
five
to
ten
days
arising
under
a
statute
section
3313.66
of
the
ohio
revised
code,
which
allowed
a
principal
to
temporarily
suspend
for
a
period
of
one
to
ten
days
without
holding
a
formal
hearing.
the
statute
required
the
principal
or
administrative
official
to
send
a
notification
to
the
parents
and
to
the
school
department
of
the
fact
that
the
suspension.
the
statute
also
contained
a
provision
which
in
the
case
of
expulsion,
required
that
the
parents
where
expulsion
was
going
to
take
place,
could
appeal
that
action
to
the
board
of
education
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
child
should
be
expelled
would
be
heard
by
the
columbus
board
of
education.
following
this
pattern
of
temporary
suspensions,
a
1983
civil
rights
action
was
instituted
in
which
the
section
i've
just
discussed
was
challenged
as
being
unconstitutional
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
due
process
clause
and
it
was
also
alleged
that
it
was
vague
and
overbroad
in
its
provisions.
following
the
conclusion
of
a
trial,
a
three-judge
district
court
concluded
in
its
opinion
that
the
statutory
section
and
the
regulations
implementing
the
statute
in
the
school
were,
in
fact,
unconstitutional
as
being
violative
of
the
due
process
clause.
the
court
concluded
that
the
statute
was
not
vague
or
overbroad
in
its
provisions.
in
ohio,
in
the
structuring
of
the
school
system,
the
ohio
constitution
directs
that
the
legislature
is
to
use
public
funds
to
establish
a
common
system
of
schools
and
also
gives
the
legislature
power
in
the
area
of
organization,
administration
and
control
of
that
particular
school
system
that
is
set
up.
in
this
particular
statute,
i
mentioned
is
one
of
that
series
of
statutory
scheme
which
sets
up
and
controls
the
common
system
of
schools
in
ohio.
it's
appellants
position
in
this
particular
case
in
analyzing
what's
involved
and
in
discussing
the
interest
of
the
school.
what’s
really
involved
in
this
whole
case
is
not
really
the
temporary
suspensions
themselves,
but
really
a
question
of
what
power
the
states
and
local
school
districts
will
have
to
structure
their
particular
school
systems.
and
when
i
use
the
term
“structure,”
i
mean,
make
decisions
with
respect
to
not
only
how
the
process
will
go
on,
who
will
be
the
teachers,
how
it
will
be
managed
and
what
form
of
academic
discipline
will
be
utilized
in
the
particular
system.
it’s
our
position
that
this
is
really
the
important
question
here
before
this
court.
in
ohio,
academic
discipline
is
viewed
by
the
ohio
courts
anyway,
as
being
part
and
parcel
of
the
educational
process,
that
has
been
so
held
in
the
lauper
(ph)
case
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs.
it's
our
position
that
the
legislature
in
this
particular
case,
given
the
type
of
area
concerned
that
they
were
involved
with,
i.e.,
the
educational
process,
wherein
you're
faced
with
entirely
different
types
of
interests
that
you
find
in
other
commons
areas
and
i
say
that
from
this
standpoint.
when
you're
trying
to
structure
a
school
system,
a
very
important
question
is,
the
type
of
relationship
that
the
state
and
carry
it
down
further,
the
local
school
districts
would
like
to
see
established
in
their
particular
district.
i
think
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes.
i
mean,
the
type
of
relationship
that
will
exist
in
the
ongoing
process
between
the
teacher,
a
student
and
a
principal,
while
the
student
is
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
not
on
a
day-by-day
basis,
but
i
think,
this
all
works
into
the
very
process
of
formulating
what
type
of
academic
discipline
is
going
to
take
place
in
the
particular
school.
viewed
in
that
context,
i
think,
the
states
must
retain
a
certain
degree
of
discretion,
if
you
will,
to
decide
for
themselves,
whether
or
not
they
will
have
academic
discipline
and
what
the
form
of
that
academic
discipline
will
be.
it's
our
position
that
based
on
a
much
similar
analogy
as
was
contained
in
the
linwood
case
that
a
legislature
that
legislates
as
it
has
done
in
this
particular
case,
which
is
in
a
restrictive
sense,
restricting
the
authority
of
the
principal
really,
from
having
a
--
what
i
would
class
as
a
carte
blanche
authority
to
discipline,
cutting
down
his
authority
to
a
period
of
a
one
to
ten
days
without
requiring
a
hearing,
while
at
the
same
time
requiring
one
or
utilizing
one
where
a
situation
is
in
expulsion
that
a
legislature
does
act
within
the
framework
of
the
type
of
discretionary
authority.
i
think,
this
court
has
talked
about
in
repeated
cases
where
it
has
been
mentioned
that
local
school
authorities
should
retain
a
great
deal
of
latitude
and
discretion
in
the
daily
management
of
their
particular
internal
affairs
of
the
school
districts.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no
injunction
was
issued
in
this
particular
case.
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
found
the
statute
and
the
regulations
unconstitutional
and
directed
the
board
of
education
and
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
and
we're
appealing.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
believe,
you
do.
of
course,
made
a
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes,
we
did.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no
injunction
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
is
not
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
there
was
really
no
orderly
hearing
on
an
injunction
at
any
point.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
the
court
left
that
kind
of
as
i
believe
in
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
is
a
direct
appeal
under
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
yeah.
there
is
no
mention
of
it
in
the
opinion
that
the
court
handed
down
all
the
court
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
we
opposed
the
injunction
from
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
if
the
court
says
--
i
won
from
the
standpoint
that
the
court
did
not
grant
one.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
the
court
required
us
to
expunge
from
the
records
of
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes,
that's
what
i
was
getting
to.
apart
from
finding
the
statute
invalid,
the
court
directed
us
to
expunge
from
the
records
of
the
pupils
involved
in
this
particular
class
action.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
the
court
did
not
specifically
label
it
an
injunction
that
they
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
--
did
require
us
to
expunge
from
the
records
of
these
people
involved
in
this
class
action.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes,
they
set
up
the
system
that
they
found
would
be
a
proper
type
of
system
to
utilize
where
a
temporary
suspension
was
going
to
take
place.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
i'm
saying
there's
not
a
label
attached
to,
but
the
court
did
mandate
us
in
a
sense
to
expunge
from
the
records
of
these
people
involved
--
any
reference
to
a
suspension
arising
out
of
this
period
of
time,
which
gave
rise
to
litigation
in
that
sense
that
you
need
an
injunction.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
pardon?
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
wholeheartedly
agree
that
in
that
sense
i
view
it
a
as
mandate
to
the
board
of
education
and
the
principles
involved.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
would
view
that
as
a
--
an
injunctive
type
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
for
the
purposes
of
your
jurisdiction.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
the
district
court
set
up
a
formula,
if
you
will,
of
how
we
were
supposed
to
handle
temporary
suspension,
saying
in
part
that
we
could
temporarily
suspend
without
a
hearing
for
a
period
of
three
days,
but
after
that
we
had
a
procedure
that
we
had
to
go
through.
so
in
that
sense
they
did
restrict,
i
think,
place
a
restriction
on
this
relationship
that
i'm
talking
about
that
i
think
the
columbus
school
district
sought
to
foster
in
its
system
and
that
is
one
of
the
discipline
being
part
and
parcel
of
the
educational
process.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
in
the
record
of
this
cause,
in
the
deposition
of
the
superintendent
of
schools
it
was
taken,
it
was
explained
that
these
records
are
not
made
generally
available
to
everyone
and
that
when
an
employer,
for
example,
calls
in
and
wants
information
about
the
student,
he
is
given
basic
information
pertaining
to
whether
his
grades,
in
whether
or
not
he
graduated
from
the
school,
that
the
records
are
not
open
for
ready
examination.
it
is
also
explained
in
that
testimony
of
the
superintendent
that
even
where
--
that
the
focus
of
their
information
they
try
to
provide
for
his
graduation
and
grades
and
also
test
where
they’ve
taken
psychological
tests
and
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
in
this
particular
record,
looking
at
the
transcripts,
it
could
show,
yes,
if
that
whole
format,
folder,
if
you
will,
that
they
utilized
was
sent
to
the
college.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
as
i
believe
the
superintendent's
testimony
was
more
in
the
nature
of
trying
to
provide
grades
and
grades
from
schooling
process
and
all
grades
in
the
psychological
test,
that
type
of
information,
and
as
other
is
requested.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes,
it
appears
in
the
appendix,
in
the
testimony
of
superintendent
ellis.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
this
was
the
policy
of
the
columbus
school
district.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no
it
was
not
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
it
was
not
the
policy
--
explained
as
being
the
policy
of
that
superintendent,
it
was
a
policy
of
the
district.
he
was
explaining
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
--
what
they
did
in
the
district.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
is
not
written
down
as
such.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
the
regulations
explained
to
the
principals
and
the
teachers,
the
process
was
that
the
records
would
not
be
circulated,
would
not
be
open
for
a
ready
examination.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
is
in
the
--
the
only
regulation
i
can
point
to
is
the
--
in
the
administrative
guide
so
to
speak
when
they
talk
about
it
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
when
they
talk
in
the
--
i
believe,
that's
in
volume
3
around
page
280,
it's
where
this
administrative
guide
is
discussed,
that
and
the
superintendent's
testimony.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
can’t
say
that
this
record
--
i
can’t
say
that
this
record
candidly
says
in
writing
that
it
will
not
be
circulated.
all
i
can
say
is
that
the
principal
explained
that
each
--
at
the
time,
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
and
in
the
operation
of
the
school,
each
principal
and
other
administrative
official
has
directed,
not
to
release
this
type
of
information.
that’s
the
type
of
testimony
that
appears
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
think,
the
board
--
no,
i
think
the
columbus
board
of
education
would
have
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it's
not
in
writing,
in
this
particular
record.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor,
not
in
the
posture
of
the
record
as
it
appears
before
this
court.
however,
i
fail
to
see
the
significance
of
the
record
showing
the
three-day
suspension,
if
you
will,
we
view
the
three-day
suspension
as
being
part
and
parcel
of
the
education
process.
it's
really
no
different
when
the
school
official
is
looking
at
any
particular
person's
record,
if
you
will,
and
they
see
on
that
record,
the
fact
that
the
person
has
flunked
mathematics.
i
think
that
the
college
or
employer
looking
at
that
particular
record
is
going
to
be
as
much
influenced
by
the
grade
that
that
individual
has
received
in
mathematics,
for
example,
as
he
is
by
what
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
have
no
individual
experience,
i
think.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor,
the
three-judge
court,
all
they
did
was
required
us
or
mandate
us
to
expunge
these
references
to
the
disciplinary
transfers
and
suspensions
from
their
records.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
they
went
no
further
than
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
if
as
mr.
justice
marshall
said,
the
record
is
made
readily
available
to
any
employer
and
he
does,
in
fact,
see
that,
yes,
it
would
be
there.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
under
the
statute,
before
it
was
declared
unconstitutional,
he
would
not
have
that
authority.
in
other
words
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
as
i
view
the
statute
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
--as
a
restrictive
statute
and
has
been
so
viewed
in
ohio
as
a
restrictive
statute.
his
authority
to
act
as
principal
could
not
be
an
action
beyond
one
to
ten
days
for
the
case
--.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
that
as
i
read
the
statute
and
interpret
it,
yes.
if
he
did
so,
he
would
be
acting
like
classified
ultra
vires,
outside
of
his
authority
and
the
superintendent
testifies
it.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
under
that
statute.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
i
view
the
statute
as
a
restrictive
statute
which
i
think
the
legislature
sought
to
draw
down
his
authority.
there
is
another
statute
which
talks
about
the
management
and
control
of
the
schools
in
section
33,
i
think,
it's
4720,
they're
both
cited
in
the
brief,
but
it
talks
in
very
general
terms
and
i
think
here
the
legislature
sought
to
further
restrict
that
authority
so
that
he
could
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
the
expulsion
is
not
defined
as
a
definition
in
the
code
that
sets
up
the
common
school
system.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
could
be
--
i
think
a
legislature
could
categorize
expulsion.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
not
that
i
can
find
in
this
particular--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
even
in
the
sense
of
the
ohio
situation,
i
don't
even
think
they
view
expulsion
as
being
permanently
out
of
the
school
or
forever.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it's
the
way
the
statute
reads,
it's
a
removal
from
the
school
for
the
remainder
of
the
school
term
which
may
even
be
30
days.
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i've
been
able
to
find
--
i've
searched
hard
to
find
any
ohio
cases
which
have
directly
taken
up
this
particular
statute
and
the
closest
thing
i
can
come
to
in
any
sense
was
a
case
in
state
fleetwood
in
20
ohio
appellate
second,
but
that
was
not
to
the
constitutional
nature
of
the
statute
itself,
it
just
has
not
been
treated
in
that
context
by
ohio
courts.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
they
seem
to
be
going
off
as
i
view
it,
the
only
way
i
can
view
it
is
the
difference
between
three
and
ten
days
that
they
seem
to
view
three
day
as
okay,
but
a
period
of
ten
days
as
violating
due
process.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
for
a
hundred?
under
my
analysis
--
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
under
my
analysis,
in
this
particular
case
as
i've
set
forth
in
my
brief,
while
expulsion
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
i
would
have
to
say
that
a
right
of
liberty
of
property
would
not
be
involved
where
the
person
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
so,
under
my
analysis.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
feel
that
the
position
in
light
of
the
roth
case,
for
example,
and
also
the
cafeteria
workers
case
follows
that
the
student
who
is
removed
from
the
process,
as
you
used
for
a
hundred
days,
is
in
no
worse
position
than
the
non-tenure
teacher
who
is
only
told
that
he
is
non-renewed,
but
where
this
district
does
not
say
to
every
other
district
in
ohio,
for
example,
don't
bother
with
this
child,
stops
and
closes
every
door
to
him
and
i
see
student
in
your
hundred-day
situation
being
in
much
the
same
posture.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
as
i've
analyzed
the
constitution
in
this
sense,
i
believe
that
i
would
have
to
answer
a
yes
to
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
and
it
seems
to
me
that
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
down
to
in
that
posture
drawing
lines
and
i
raised
any
question
of
where
will
we
stop
and
i
can
come
back
to
my
situation
of
--
do
we
go
to
a
hearing
process
where
a
person
is
receiving
a
grade
or
something
of
that
similar
nature.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes
and
i
might
have
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
yes,
in
my
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
believe,
it
fits
in
to
the
doctrine
of
the
ohio
discipline
inculcating
self-disciplinary
respect
for
a
30
days
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
process
and
i
think
a
legislature
that
does
this,
a
legislature
as
it
has
done
here
with
this
statute,
it
doesn't
seem
to--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
as
i
read
the
record
and
have
analyzed
the
record,
i
believe
that
the
record
does
not
disclose
that
the
particular
suspensions
involved
in
this
case
really
had
any
effect
on
the
outcome
of
their
proceeding
through
the
process.
for
example,
one
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
believe
that
should
be
a
question
for
the
state
legislature
to
decide
whether
they
want
to?
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
they
could
very
well
use
their
time
in
some
other
pursuit,
for
example,
they
might
have
received
training
in
a
vocational
endeavor
or
maybe
working
with
somebody
in
the
outside.
it
may
not
be
waste,
i
think.
that's
up
to
the
individual
how
he
utilizes
that
additional
time.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
they
could
very
well
do
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
i
don't
think
you
can
engage
in
that
kind
of
speculation.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
your
honor,
i
cannot.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
believe
it
disrupts
the
very
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
believe
it
disrupts
the
very
process
i've
been
talking
about
and
the
relationship
i've
been
talking
about,
that
the
school
system
seeks
to
foster.
i
believe
that
you
say
that
a
three-day
rule
and
go
beyond
that,
there
must
be
a
hearing,
but
right
away
you've
been
injected
into
the
relationship
at
least
a
quasi-judicial
type
of
adversary
relationship.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no
it
doesn't.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
doesn't
--
it
says
you
can't
go
beyond
the
ten
days.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
it
doesn't
limit,
the
school
board
in
ohio
is
a
political
subdivision,
if
you
will.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
hasn't
taken
the
power
away
from
them.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
think,
to
me
an
expulsion
characterizes
something
where
the
district
or
school
says
to
pupil,
in
essence,
we
want
to
remove
you
from
the
school
on
a
permanent
type
basis.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
no,
not
more
than
ten
days.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
think
it's
important
to
the
system
in
the
relationship
that
the
district
tries
to
establish
in
that
system.
it
is
important
that
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
specifically,
because
i
think
the
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
pardon?
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
not
because
i
like
it,
i
think
it's
because
the
legislature
wants
to
have
the
principal
and
his
relationship
with
the
student,
have
a
broad
range
of
authority
here
--
limited
authority
protect
not
only
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
--
few
individuals
but
the
entire
school
as
a
whole.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think,
it's
this
type
of
line
drawing
that
we're
engaging
in
gets
into
this
type
of
problem.
i
think
that's
a
line
that
should
be
drawn
by
the
legislative
body
if
they
still
have
any
kind
of
discretionary
authority.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
it
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
you
could
be
looking
at
it
in
the
face
of
this
record
and
say
that
in
a
sense,
because
here
the
principal
that
is
portrayed
in
the
testimony
of
the
principal
fulton,
when
he
handed
out
the
suspension,
he
was
trying
to
restore
order
so
that
the
vast
bulk
of
students
could
get
on
with
the
process
of
day-to-day
learning.
so,
i
think,
you
could
characterize
it
in
a
sense
as
a
cooling
off
period.
also
from
this
sense,
the
principal
tries
to,
during
his
period
and
is
portrayed
in
his
testimony
also,
meet
with
the
student
and
his
parents
and
discuss
the
student's
entire
school
record
with
the
emphasis
on
trying
to
find
out
what
the
student’s
problem
is
and
how
they
can
get
that
student
progressing
again.
so
in
that
sense
i
would
--
you
could
characterize
it
as
a
cooling
off
period.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
it
gets
down
to,
i
believe
here,
your
honor,
gets
down
around
starting
on
page
from
60
over
to
64
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
in
the
back,
yeah,
and
on
page
63,
it
gets
into
in
more
detail.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
well,
i
view
this
decision,
entire
decision
as
being
open
to
review
by
this
court,
i
think
they
probably
could
argue
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
drawing
its
line
to
three
days
and
possibly
should
be
one
or
even
less
than
that.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
there
is
a
new
procedure
that
the
--
let's
say
a
new
procedure,
new
guidelines,
if
you
will,
that
the
board
sat
down
--
it's
contained
on
page
25
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
they
are
in
effect.
when
i
say
guidelines
--
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
--
it's
an
operational
procedure
that
the
principals
are
told
how
they
will
operate
under
the
particular
statute.
mr.
thomas
a.
bustin
i'm
not
at
all
sure.
the
district
court
in
its
opinion
sloughed
