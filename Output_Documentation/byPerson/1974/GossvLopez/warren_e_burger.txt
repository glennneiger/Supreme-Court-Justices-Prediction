chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
73-898,
goss
against
lopez.
mr.
bustin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
that
you
mean
between
the
teachers
and
the
students,
i
assume?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
members
of
the
school
board,
for
example,
don't
have
anything
directly
to
do
with
the
students
day
by
day,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
explicit
in
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
injunction,
both
a
temporary
and
permanent
injunction
was
paid
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
by
inference,
the
court
has
restricted
the
freedom
of
the
school
district
to
handle
suspensions
the
way
they
formerly
handled
them,
by
imposing
affirmative
requirements?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
in
the
court's
opinion
that
says
yeh
or
neh
about
what
maybe
done
with
the
transcript
of
the
student’s
record
now
under
the
holding
of
the
three-judge
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
school
may
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
school
may
suspend
for
three-days
without
a
hearing
in
the
future.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
that
is
placed
on
the
record,
it
will
go
in
whatever
manner
it
has
previously
gone,
is
that
a
fair
assumption?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
this
opinion
didn't
touch
--
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
didn't
touch
on
that
issue
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
correct
to
or
incorrect
to
say
that
the
difference
between
the
three-judge
federal
court
and
the
ohio
statute
is
the
difference
between
ten
days
and
three-days
on
this
suspension,
is
there
--?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
you
were
trying
to
defend
a
100-day
statute,
you
would
have
some
additional
problems
of
showing
that
that
did
not
totally
disrupt
the
student's
school
progress
for
that
year,
would
you
not?
i’m
not
talking
about
practical
problems,
whether
they
are
constitutional
or
not,
is
it
not
a
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suspension
for
a
hundred
days
is
certainly
going
to
pretty
well
cut
him
off
for
the
school
year
unless
some
substitute
teaching
is
provided,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
ten
days
you
say
is
--
the
difference
between
ten
days
and
three
days
is
merely
a
matter
of
judgment
in
drawing
a
line.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
seem
to
make
that
argument,
one
argument
along
these
lines
negatively
by
pointing
out
as
i
recall
it
that
all
of
these
students
did
just
as
well
or
better
after
they
came
back
to
school,
is
that
correct,
as
i
read
your
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
perhaps
their
parents
might
require
them
to
stay
home
and
study?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
are
things
we
can't
really
speculate
about,
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
bustin,
in
the
number
of
the
states,
they
have
statutes
which
limit
the
right
to
strike
except
after
a
ten
days
notice,
they
call
it
colloquially
at
least
the
cooling
off
period,
but
in
your
view
that
there's
some
cooling
off
process
involved
in
the
ten
days
that
would
not
be
provided
in
a
three-day
period?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
at
least
that
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
legislature?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
think
mr.
justice
blackmun
had
questioned
you,
he
was
trying
to
profound
you
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
roos.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
that
means
that
the
discretion
in
the
first
instance
rests
with
the
principal
under
this
opinion
for
72
hours?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
we
said
--
decide
to
slice
it
a
little
differently
and
say
six
days,
not
ten
days
as
the
statute
required
and
not
three
as
the
district
court,
but
six,
would
you
think
there’d
be
any
basis
for
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
is
going
to
determine
that
when
and
with
what
consequences?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
where
are
you
reading?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
interested
in
your
slicing
that
day
off.
you
say
a
suspension
for
one
hour
without
any
notice
and
for
any
reason
is
appropriate,
and
obviously,
then
that
--
my
next
question
and
i
don't
want
to
ask
it
would
be
two
hours,
three
hours
and
until
we
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
get
your
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
of
course,
aren't
there
a
good
many
areas
in
which
peremptory
action
is
allowed
which
involved
stigmatizing
and
no
prior
hearing
and
no
notice
is
given
if
there
is
probable
cause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
often
people
are
arrested
in
situations
where
there
is
no
emergency.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
sometimes
with
a
warrant
and
sometimes
without
a
warrant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
no
notice
in
advance,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
adverse
effect
on
the
other
students
and
their
rights
to
a
quiet
classroom,
to
orderly
procedures,
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
all
the
things
that
teachers
and
parents
desire?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
and
i
think
your
time
is
entirely
consumed,
mr.
bustin,
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
