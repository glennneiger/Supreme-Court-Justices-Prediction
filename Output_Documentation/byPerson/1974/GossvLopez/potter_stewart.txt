justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case
but
there
wasn't
any
--
my
brother
white
certainly
raise
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
an
injunction,
however
it
was
labeled,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bustin,
under
the
existing
statute,
what
if
a
principal
wanted
to
suspend
a
student
for
15
days?
justice
potter
stewart
he
has
no
authority
apparently,
it's
an
odd
statute
that
apparently
he
has
no
authority,
with
or
without
a
hearing,
to
suspend
a
student
longer
than
ten
days,
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
can
he
suspend
a
student
for
11
days
with
or
without
a
hearing,
apparently?
justice
potter
stewart
had
no
choice
except
between
a
suspension
of
ten
days
or
less
and
expulsion?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
you
think
there
is
any
power
other
than
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
perhaps
you
know
the
next
case,
as
i
remember
at
least
the
suspension
was
until
the
end
of
the
school
year
and
that
just
couldn't
--
there
would
be
no
power
to
do
that
on
ohio?
or
would
that
be
expulsion?
is
expulsion
defined
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose,
you
could
have
expulsion
for
20
days,
could
you?
justice
potter
stewart
it
hasn't
defined
expulsion
at
all,
has
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
you
understand
the
meaning
of
the
word
“expulsion,”
does
it
mean,
permanently
out
of
school,
forever?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
it
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
has
there
been
any
laws
on
this,
any
limitations
on
this
expulsion?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
maybe
--
justice
potter
stewart
maybe
a
suspension
beyond
ten
days
becomes
an
expulsion,
i'm
talking
now
about
the
very
last
sentence
of
the
statute
that
says
that
no
pupil
shall
be
suspended
or
expelled
from
any
school
beyond
the
current
semester,
which
implies
at
least
as
a
negative
inference
that
an
expulsion
could
be
for
a
period
beyond
ten
days,
but
never
beyond
the
end
of
the
current
semester?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
the
last
sentence
of
the
statute
certainly
doesn't
imply
a
permanent
basis?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
maximum
beyond
the
current
semester?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
where
in
this
opinion
do
you
find
the
three-day
business?
where
do
you
find
the
three-day
business,
mr.
bustin?
everybody
seems
to
be
pretty
fair
and
i
assume
it
is,
but
i
--
or
perhaps
in
the
opinions
in
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
have
one
further
question,
if
i
may,
assuming
there
is
a
three-day
holding
here,
there
was
no
cross-petition
first,
there
was
no
cross-appeal.
would
the
appellees
in
this
case
be
free
to
argue
that
there
should
be
a
hearing
of
some
kind
before
any
suspension
even
for
a
one
day
or
two
day
in
your
view?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
you
don't
read
the
opinion
to
say
that
a
suspension
without
a
hearing
for
three
days
is
constitutionally
valid?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
i'm
sorry,
i
missed
the
earlier
part,
these
guidelines
are
something
that's
developed
since
the
decision
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it
used
to
work
the
other
day,
either
way,
you
have
to
stay
a
little
longer
at
school?
justice
potter
stewart
but
then?
justice
potter
stewart
arrests,
for
example?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case

there
wasn't
any
