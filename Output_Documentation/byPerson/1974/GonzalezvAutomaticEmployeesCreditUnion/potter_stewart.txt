justice
potter
stewart
mr.
latturner,
would
you
straighten
me
out
on
this
insurance.
the
insurance
payment
in
mercantile
received
was
came
about
because
of
the
cancellation
of
the
policy
does
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
that
happened,
is
mr.
gonzales
in
any
way
in
default
under
his
contract
obligation
to
keep
the
car
insured?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
must
have
been
because
there
were
two
accidents,
were
there
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i'm
merely
asking
whether
he
was
under
an
obligation
to
keep
the
car
insured?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
you’re
talking
about
now
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
hear
this
directly
appeal.
there
was
a
lawsuit
brought
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
state
statute.
three-judge
court
was
convened.
the
court
declined
to
issue
the
prayer
for
injunction
and
dismissed
the
case.
you
say
that
falls
squarely
within
the
statute
which
gives
which
authorizes
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
many
cases
so
hold
none
you
say.
i
would
have
thought
there
might
have
been
more
than
that
but
in
any
event
that
doesn’t
really
answer,
that
answers
only
one
of
the
questions
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now
let’s
say
the
case
is
properly
here
on
appeal
it
still
leaves
open
whether
or
not
the
correct
disposition
for
isn’t
to
save
the
case
now
become
moot.

justice
potter
stewart
this
case
has
been
brought
here
by
a
direct
appeal
under
the
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
section
1253
from
an
order
of
a
three-judge
court
dismissing
the
appellant's
complaint
for
a
lack
of
standing.
we
deferred
consideration
of
our
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal
until
the
hearing
of
the
argument
on
the
merits.
for
the
reasons
discussed
in
considerable
detail
in
the
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
have
concluded
that
the
district
court's
order
is
not
directly
appealable
to
this
court
because
of
the
nature
of
the
issues
involved
in
this
case
relating
as
they
do
to
the
interrelationship
of
the
three-judge
court
statutes
and
the
correlative
statutes
conferring
direct
jurisdiction
upon
this
court
of
appeals
and
three-judge
courts,
this
opinion
is
not
one
that
lend
itself
to
very
intelligible
oral
announcement.
suffice
it
to
say
that
we
hold
that
when
a
three-judge
court
denies
a
plaintiff
injunctive
relief
on
grounds
which
if
valid
would
have
justified
the
solution
of
the
court
as
to
that
plaintiff
or
a
refusal
to
request
the
convention
of
a
three-judge
court
in
the
first
place
then
review
of
the
denial
is
available
only
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
here.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
before
us
and
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
so
that
a
fresh
order
may
be
entered
and
a
timely
appeal
prosecuted
to
the
court
of
appeals.
