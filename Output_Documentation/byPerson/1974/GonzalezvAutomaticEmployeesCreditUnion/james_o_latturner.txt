mr.
james
o.
latturner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
gonzalez
brought
this
action
--
challenge
against
his
creditor
mercantile
national
bank,
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
repossession
and
resale
provisions
of
the
illinois
commercial
code,
and
against
the
title
officer
to
the
state
of
illinois
the
secretary
of
state
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
those
provisions
of
the
illinois
motor
vehicle
code
that
authorize
and
compel
the
involuntary
transfer
and
--
termination
and
transfer
of
her
certificate
of
the
title.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
subsequently
dismissed
the
action.
a
direct
appeal
was
then
brought
to
this
court
and
this
court
postponed
the
question
of
its
jurisdiction
pending
this
hearing.
mercantile
has
raised
two
objections
to
this
court’s
jurisdiction.
first,
that
a
three-judge
court
was
not
properly
convened
under
section
2281
and
second
that
a
direct
appeal
does
not
lie
pursuant
to
section
1253.
because
of
the
nature
of
the
jurisdictional
questions,
a
brief
review
of
the
underlying
facts
and
a
summary
of
the
lower
courts
actual
holding
is
necessary.
mr.
gonzalez
had
purchased
a
used
automobile
pursuant
to
a
retail
installment
contract
which
was
in
turn
assigned
to
mercantile.
when
mercantile
repossessed
the
automobile
they
had
received
an
amount
in
excess
of
what
was
then
due
and
owing
on
the
contract.
although
mr.
gonzalez
had
not
made
one
payment,
mercantile
had
received
an
insurance
rebate
which
they
were
required
to
credit
to
mr.
gonzalez.
mercantile
however,
credited
the
rebate
to
the
final
payments
not
to
the
current
one
and
repossessed
the
automobile.
upon
consideration
of
these
facts,
the
three-judge
district
court
found
that
mr.
gonzalez
was
not
in
default
at
the
time
his
automobile
was
repossessed
and
they
thereupon
dismissed
the
case
for
lack
of
standing.
they
held
that
the
challenged
statute
provide
for
repossession
only
in
the
event
of
default
and
since
mr.
gonzalez
was
not
in
default,
mercantile
violated
the
statute
rather
than
acting
pursuant
to
it.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
his
car
has
been
seized.
there
is
no
state
proceeding
following
the
repossession.
it
is
seized.
the
certificate
of
title
it
transferred
to
--
from
--
his
name
is
eliminated
from
the
certificate
of
title
by
the
secretary
of
state.
it
is
issued
only
in
the
name
of
the
creditor.
the
creditor
then
resells
the
car
being
able
to
pay
a
good
title.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
these
had
all
happened
to
mr.
gonzalez.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
had
not
been
given
any
remedies.
he
was
given
neither
notice
nor
a
hearing
concerning
the
creditor’s
right
to
possession
of
the
automobile.
the
repossession
is
without
notice
or
a
hearing.
the
transfer
of
title
is
without
a
hearing.
the
resale
is
without
a
hearing.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
could
have
sued
for
an
injunction
in
state
court
to
enjoin
the
resale
of
the
automobile.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
would
have
a
remedy
for
conversion
also.
however,
the
claim
in
this
case
is
the
due
process
of
law
requires
that
he
have
a
hearing
before
he
is
deprived
of
his
property
and
the
fact
that
he
may
have
a
subsequent
action
for
damages
does
not
affect
his
ability
to
bring
this
action
asking
for
a
prior
due
process
hearing.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
if
we
prevail
ultimately
in
the
lower
court
upon
remand
here?
mr.
james
o.
latturner
if
we
prevail
here,
the
case
would
be
remanded
to
the
three-judge
district
court
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
creditor’s
and
secretary’s
actions
violate
due
process.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
if
they
are
determined
that
they
violate
due
process
then
they
would
have
to
be
a
hearing
either
before
or
concurrently
with
the
repossession
and
before
the
certificate
of
title
is
terminated
and
transfer
to
the
creditor.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
he
has
not
requested
the
return
of
that
particular
automobile.
he
is
suing
for
future
--
for
perspective
declaratory
and
injunction
relief
against
the
future
enforcement
and
execution
of
the
challenged
statutes
and
this
future
relief
is
very
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
repossession
was
pursuant
to
section
9503
of
the
illinois
commercial
code.
the
certificate
of
title
is
terminated
and
transferred
pursuant
to
section
3114
and
116
of
the
illinois
motor
vehicle
code.
they
were
pursuant
to
those
statutes
without
hearing.
when
the
lower
court
dismissed
the
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
i
cannot
remember
the
exact
dates
the
insurance
cancellation
and
the
one
this
payment
were
very
close
together.
i
believe
the
missed
payment
was
--
the
first
accident
was
before
the
missed
payment
and
i
believe
the
actual
cancellation
was
after
the
missed
payment.
they
has
not
repossess
at
that
time.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
there
are
two
accidents,
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
is
under
an
obligation
to
keep
the
car
insured
if
not
the
creditor
is
under
an
obligation
to
purchase
the
insurance
and
in
this
case
the
creditor
mercantile
had
not
purchase
the
insurance.
they
had
also
had
not
signed
for
the
release
of
the
automobile
from
the
repair.
he
was
in
the
dispute
with
mercantile
over
the
entire
question
of
this
insurance.
the
insurance
have
been
purchase
for
him
by
the
creditor.
when
the
court
dismissed
the
action
for
lack
of
standing
because
mr.
gonzalez
was
not
in
default,
they
held
that
he
did
not
have
standing
to
adjudicate
the
denial
of
a
prior
hearing
because
if
he
would
have
had
such
a
hearing
he
would
have
prevailed.
they
held
instead
that
only
those
persons
who
would
lost
a
due
process
hearing
have
standing
to
contest
the
fact
that
they
were
denied
such
a
hearing.
as
noted
before,
mr.
gonzalez’
automobile
prior
to
his
intervention
in
this
action
had
been
repossessed,
title
transferred
and
resold.
and
the
court
thereupon
held
that
his
request
for
an
injunction
was
useless
and
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
either
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief.
however,
mr.
gonzales
did
not
request
the
return
of
that
particular
car.
he
sued
to
enjoin
the
future
enforcement
of
the
challenged
statute
and
it
is
this
perspective
relief
that
is
important
and
necessary
to
mr.
gonzalez.
the
repossession
entitled
transfer
statutes
are
still
on
the
books
and
are
still
being
enforced.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
he
is
not.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
has
not
purchase
another
car
on
credit.
with
a
credit
record
already
showing
one
repossession,
mr.
gonzalez
is
particularly
vulnerable
to
these
statutes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
but
this
is
part
of
these
statutes
on
the
presence
of
that
and
their
enforcement
are
part
of
his
continuing
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
purchase
a
car
on
credit
and
if
so
whether
or
not
he
can
maintain
and
enforce
any
rights
that
he
may
have
against
his
creditor.
this
is
the
same
type
of
situation
as
present
and
super
tire
versus
mccorkle,
where
the
strike
had
ended
all
of
the
strikers
went
off
of
welfare
but
if
there
was
ever
another
labor
dispute
the
super
tire
company
knew
that
their
strikers
could
receive
public
aid
payment
but
it
would
have
an
effect
upon
their
labor
negotiations,
it
would
have
an
effect
upon
their
decisions
on
any
negotiating
session.
mr.
gonzalez
is
in
the
same
type
of
situation
particularly
since
he
has
suffered
one
repossession
and
it
is
on
his
credit
record.
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
occasions
when
a
debtor
is
justified
in
not
making
the
payment.
however,
future
creditors
of
mr.
gonzalez
cannot
be
expected
to
tolerate
such
a
happening
whatever
the
reasons.
if
he
moves
in
to
the
situations
he
would
either
have
to
concede
his
rights
vis-à-vis
his
creditor
or
take
the
chance
on
losing
his
car.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
its
not
just
fear
of
a
potential
application.
mr.
gonzalez
has
been
directly
harmed
by
the
operation
of
these
statutes.
it
can
happen
again
if
a
passed
were
on
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
entire
question
of
a
prior
hearing
is
to
avoid
such
an
abuse.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
has
been
paid
for
it.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
sued
instead
of
for
an
injunction
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
having
been
harmed
by
the
statute
he
also
sued
his
representative
of
class
and
the
enforcement
and
execution
of
the
statute
is
still
proceeding
with
regard
to
the
class
having
been
harmed
by
the
operation
of
this
statute
mr.
gonzalez
can
represent
this
class.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
class
are
debtors
under
contracts
of
the
security
interest
whereby
the
creditor
has
the
right
to
repossess
pursuant
to
illinois
law.
if
i
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
if
i
may
get
to
that.
mr.
gonzalez
did
not
sue
for
an
injunction
returning
that
car.
he
sued
for
damages
because
of
that
repossession.
if
he
would
have
had
obtained
an
injunction
from
the
court
returning
that
car
there
would
be
no
question
he
would
have
a
valid
claim.
instead,
he
sued
for
damages
and
mercantile
has
paid
him
damages
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
in
this
court.
and
then
in
this
complaint,
yes
it
was
count
four.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
that
is
the
damage
claim
here.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
has
been
--
they
have
tendered
the
stipulated
maximum
of
the
damage.
he
has
been
paid
pursuant
to
and
accepted
this
complaint.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
he
did.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
for
the
denial
of
the
prior
hearing,
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
what’s
left
is
he
has
been
injured
by
the
statute.
they
are
still
on
the
books.
they
have
a
continuing
effect
upon
his
present
decisions
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
in
monroe
versus
pape,
the
defendants
there
acted
in
direct
violation
of
the
statute
and
the
question
was
whether
when
state
officials
operate
in
violation
of
a
statute
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
and
the
court’s
holding
is
when
they
act
under
color
of
law
pursuant
to
a
statute
that
even
there
violation
of
it.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
is
included
along
with
mercantile
national
bank,
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
there
were
originally
four
defendants,
pardon
me,
four
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
mr.
gonzalez
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
put
the
case
in
the
same
posture
if
he
would
have
gotten
an
injunction
getting
his
car
back.
the
burney
case
went
through
a
separate
proceeding,
not
the
case
of
bar
achieving
the
same
result.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
she
proceeded
a
completely
separate
action
apart
from
the
suit
for
the
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
this
case
put
it
in
the
same
situation
as
moore
versus
ogilvie
were
even
though
the
act
has
happened
the
case
is
not
moot.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
i
think
i
would
because
the
defendants
cannot
be
allowed
to
continually
pay
off
individual
plaintiffs
and
particularly
for
plaintiffs
in
order
to
maintain
an
constitutional
system
of
repossession.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
that
is
true.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
response
to
the
question
is
that
having
been
injured
by
the
statute
he
can
sue
to
enjoin
its
future
enforcement
because
the
presence
of
those
laws
on
the
books
continue
to
affect
him
in
his
business
dealings
of
whether
or
not
to
purchase
a
car
on
credit
and
if
so
whether
or
not
he
maintain
--
he
can
maintain
his
rights
against
his
creditors.
it
is
in
that
respect
no
different
then
super
tire
versus
mccorkle
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
(voice
overlap)
the
other
plaintiffs
are
not
a
party
to
this
court.
for
example,
mr.
moe
he
could
do
the
original
plaintiff
due
to
illness
in
his
family
as
we
took
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
okay,
mr.
gonzalez
is
the
only
plaintiff.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
only
the
claim
for
damage
as
the
claim
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
i
might
add
that
this
case
was
brought
in
two
counts,
one
against
the
creditor
and
one
against
the
secretary
of
state.
the
claim
against
the
secretary
of
state
can
stand
on
its
own
regardless
of
being
attached
to
a
claim
against
the
creditor.
this
is
on
the
certificate
transferred
at
this
certificate
of
title.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
there
was
never
damage
claim
against
the
secretary
of
state.
he
is
a
state
official
acting
pursuant
to
state
statutes
and
i
believe
that
the
damage
claim
would
not
lie
on
federal
court
under
edelman
versus
jordan.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
it
did
not.
in
fact
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
--
it
referred
only
to
the
count
four.
it
did
not
even
refer
to
the
count
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
mercantile.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
change
in
rule
by
the
secretary
of
state
was
accomplished
in
order
to
avoid
the
temporary
restraining
order
in
this
case.
it
is
a
mere
administrative
procedural
change.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
pardon?
they
are
still
on
operation
but
they
can
be
as
easily
shifted
back
from
morning
after
this
litigation
as
they
were
instituted.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
i
am
not
satisfied
with
them?
mr.
james
o.
latturner
because
under
the
present
rules
the
secretary
of
state
has
delegated
what
should
be
his
duties
and
responsibilities
to
the
creditor.
thus,
the
notice
of
the
proposed
application
for
the
new
certificate
of
title
is
drafted
and
sent
by
the
creditor.
the
creditor
drafts
a
propose
affidavit
of
defense
that
may
be
sent
back
in.
the
affidavit
of
the
debtor
files
had
they
sent
not
to
the
secretary
of
state
but
to
the
creditor.
the
creditor
then
can
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
a
valid
affidavit
of
defense
and
if
he
rejects
it
can
then
apply
for
a
new
certificate
of
title
stating
that
an
affidavit
was
not
receive.
there
is
never
any
hearing
or
notice
sent
by
the
secretary.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
i
think
you
have
to
determine
whether
the
case
is
properly
here
first.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
i
was
getting
to
them.
i
notice
my
time
has
expired.
i
would
like
to
--
well,
pardon
me,
let
me
stay
with
those
for
a
moment.
secretary
--
the
action
was
brought
against
the
state
official,
the
secretary
of
state
suing
to
enjoin
him
from
the
enforcement
and
execution
of
state
statute
of
statewide
application,
termination,
and
transfer
provisions
to
the
illinois
motor
vehicle
code
pursuant
to
because
they
violate
due
process.
thus,
all
of
the
technical
requirements
of
2281
are
met.
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
substantial
constitutional
question
against
the
secretary.
mercantile
alleges
that
the
secretary
is
not
the
actual
means
of
enforcement
of
those
statutes
but
that
argument
could
not
be
more
incorrect.
he
is
the
only
means
of
enforcement
of
those
statutes.
mercantile
also
alleges
that
he
is
only
a
nominal
defendant
because
the
certificates
of
title
and
their
transfer
are
meaningless
and
ministerial.
however,
the
state
of
the
illinois
by
another
statutory
provision
provides
for
due
process
protection
to
certificates
of
title
in
all
instances
except
when
it’s
terminated
after
repossession.
in
all
other
instances
before
the
secretary
of
state
can
involuntarily
terminate
a
certificate
of
title
he
must
send
notice,
he
must
set
a
hearing,
he
must
issue
subpoenas,
he
must
hold
the
hearing,
and
his
decision
is
subject
to
jurisdiction
review.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
it
was.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
it
could
not.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
under
idlewild
versus
epstein
when
an
application
for
a
three-judge
court
is
made
the
single
judge
must
look
to
see
if
the
technical
requirements
are
met
and
at
the
substantial
constitutional
question
is
allege
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
state
officer,
state
statute
of
statewide
application.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
questions
of
standing
and
mootness
are
more
properly
decided
by
three-judge
courts.
in
the
past
they
have
been
and
this
court
has
accepted
numerous
of
those
cases
on
direct
appeal.
in
making
the
determination
as
to
standing
in
this
case,
it
required
an
analysis
of
the
statute
by
the
three-judge
court.
they
went
in
reaching
a
standing
issue
into
the
statutory
scheme
itself.
it
was
not
a
cursory
analysis
at
the
very
beginning.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
it
did
not
require.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct,
they
did
not
reach
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
because
the
three-judge
--
when
there
is
an
application
for
a
three-judge
court
the
single
judge
does
not
have
power
to
either
grant
or
withhold
relief.
he
is
specifically
by
2284
sub
paragraph
5
cannot
dismiss
the
action.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
if
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
question,
the
proper
procedure
is
to
convene
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
okay.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
can
only
decide
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
question.
if
he
determines
there
is
no
substantial
constitutional
question
he
can
dismiss
the
case.
if
he
determines
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
question
he
must
convene
the
three-judge
court
to
determine
all
of
the
other
issues
which
may
result
in
either
the
granting
or
denial
of
relief.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
would
have
that
power
if
he
made
such
a
holding.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
it
basically
comes
down
to
how
far
deeply
into
the
statute
and
then
to
the
case
they
have
to
go
and
many
questions
concerning
standing
or
mootness
go
very
hard.
in
this
case,
for
the
mootness
they
went
to
the
ultimate
issue
in
the
case
whether
or
not
an
injunction
should
issue.
clearly,
the
single
judge
could
not
dismiss
on
the
grounds
dismissed
here
because
it
involved
the
direct
explicit
denial
of
an
injunction.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
first
counsel
indicates
this
is
my
case
and
that
mr.
gonzalez’
case
that
is
totally
incorrect.
i
have
been
indicated
this
morning
the
interest
that
mr.
gonzalez
has
in
the
resolution
of
the
question
presented
here.
that
resolution
is
important
enough
for
him
that
he
has
personally
born
across
at
this
appeal.
this
is
his
case
i
am
representing
him
as
his
attorney.
secondly,
mr.
brennan
referred
to
the
time
spent
--
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to
the
time
spent
on
jurisdictional
questions.
since
1960,
this
court
has
taken
on
direct
appeal
nine
cases
in
the
same
procedural
posture
as
this
court
is
this
case.
a
three-judge
district
court
has
been
properly
convened
and
has
dismissed
the
case
without
going
to
the
ultimate
issue.
overruling
that
well-established
rule
is
not
going
to
lessen
the
burdens
on
this
court
its
going
to
increase
it.
you
were
going
to
be
face
with
a
proliferation
of
the
cases
having
to
do
what
this
court’s
jurisdiction.
the
direct
appeal
rule
in
this
instance
is
one
of
the
few
areas
and
the
three-judge
court
litigation
practice
which
is
well
settled.
it
should
stay
that
way.
overruling
it
would
create
additional
confusion
and
new
burdens
for
both
courts
and
litigants
alike.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
mr.
justice
stewart
this
case
is
in
the
same
procedural
position
now
as
fuentes
versus
shevin
was
when
this
court
reached
its
opinion
there.
in
fuentes,
the
property
of
the
plaintiffs
had
already
been
replevied.
it
was
gone.
they
did
not
get
the
property
back.
they
sued
to
enjoin
the
future
enforcement
and
execution
of
the
replevin
statutes.
mr.
gonzalez’
automobile
has
been
repossessed.
it
is
gone
he
will
not
get
it
back.
he
has
sued
to
enjoin
the
future
enforces
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
fuentes’
plaintiffs
did
not
request
damages.
they
sued
only
for
the
future
enforcement
there.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
it
would
not
go
to
the
injunctive
relief
that
the
question
pending
them
both
cases
is
the
future
enforcement
because
of
the
effect
that
this
is
going
to
the
continuing
enforcement
was
held
on
the
plaintiffs
and
the
class
they
represent.
the
payment
to
the
individual
plaintiff
here
does
not
affect
either
of
those
issues.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
this
case
is
on
that
question
has
so
held
in
lynch
versus
household
finance
that
the
dismissal
of
the
case
as
a
denial
of
all
relief
requesting
including
the
injunction
that
comes
here
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct.
thank
you.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
gonzalez
brought
this
action
--
challenge
against
his
creditor
mercantile
national
bank,
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
repossession
and
resale
provisions
of
the
illinois
commercial
code,
and
against
the
title
officer
to
the
state
of
illinois
the
secretary
of
state
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
those
provisions
of
the
illinois
motor
vehicle
code
that
authorize
and
compel
the
involuntary
transfer
and
--
termination
and
transfer
of
her
certificate
of
the
title.
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
and
subsequently
dismissed
the
action.
a
direct
appeal
was
then
brought
to
this
court
and
this
court
postponed
the
question
of
its
jurisdiction
pending
this
hearing.
mercantile
has
raised
two
objections
to
this
court’s
jurisdiction.
first,
that
a
three-judge
court
was
not
properly
convened
under
section
2281
and
second
that
a
direct
appeal
does
not
lie
pursuant
to
section
1253.
because
of
the
nature
of
the
jurisdictional
questions,
a
brief
review
of
the
underlying
facts
and
a
summary
of
the
lower
courts
actual
holding
is
necessary.
mr.
gonzalez
had
purchased
a
used
automobile
pursuant
to
a
retail
installment
contract
which
was
in
turn
assigned
to
mercantile.
when
mercantile
repossessed
the
automobile
they
had
received
an
amount
in
excess
of
what
was
then
due
and
owing
on
the
contract.
although
mr.
gonzalez
had
not
made
one
payment,
mercantile
had
received
an
insurance
rebate
which
they
were
required
to
credit
to
mr.
gonzalez.
mercantile
however,
credited
the
rebate
to
the
final
payments
not
to
the
current
one
and
repossessed
the
automobile.
upon
consideration
of
these
facts,
the
three-judge
district
court
found
that
mr.
gonzalez
was
not
in
default
at
the
time
his
automobile
was
repossessed
and
they
thereupon
dismissed
the
case
for
lack
of
standing.
they
held
that
the
challenged
statute
provide
for
repossession
only
in
the
event
of
default
and
since
mr.
gonzalez
was
not
in
default,
mercantile
violated
the
statute
rather
than
acting
pursuant
to
it.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
his
car
has
been
seized.
there
is
no
state
proceeding
following
the
repossession.
it
is
seized.
the
certificate
of
title
it
transferred
to
--
from
--
his
name
is
eliminated
from
the
certificate
of
title
by
the
secretary
of
state.
it
is
issued
only
in
the
name
of
the
creditor.
the
creditor
then
resells
the
car
being
able
to
pay
a
good
title.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
these
had
all
happened
to
mr.
gonzalez.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
had
not
been
given
any
remedies.
he
was
given
neither
notice
nor
a
hearing
concerning
the
creditor’s
right
to
possession
of
the
automobile.
the
repossession
is
without
notice
or
a
hearing.
the
transfer
of
title
is
without
a
hearing.
the
resale
is
without
a
hearing.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
could
have
sued
for
an
injunction
in
state
court
to
enjoin
the
resale
of
the
automobile.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
would
have
a
remedy
for
conversion
also.
however,
the
claim
in
this
case
is
the
due
process
of
law
requires
that
he
have
a
hearing
before
he
is
deprived
of
his
property
and
the
fact
that
he
may
have
a
subsequent
action
for
damages
does
not
affect
his
ability
to
bring
this
action
asking
for
a
prior
due
process
hearing.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
if
we
prevail
ultimately
in
the
lower
court
upon
remand
here?
mr.
james
o.
latturner
if
we
prevail
here,
the
case
would
be
remanded
to
the
three-judge
district
court
for
a
determination
of
whether
the
creditor’s
and
secretary’s
actions
violate
due
process.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
if
they
are
determined
that
they
violate
due
process
then
they
would
have
to
be
a
hearing
either
before
or
concurrently
with
the
repossession
and
before
the
certificate
of
title
is
terminated
and
transfer
to
the
creditor.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
he
has
not
requested
the
return
of
that
particular
automobile.
he
is
suing
for
future
--
for
perspective
declaratory
and
injunction
relief
against
the
future
enforcement
and
execution
of
the
challenged
statutes
and
this
future
relief
is
very
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
repossession
was
pursuant
to
section
9503
of
the
illinois
commercial
code.
the
certificate
of
title
is
terminated
and
transferred
pursuant
to
section
3114
and
116
of
the
illinois
motor
vehicle
code.
they
were
pursuant
to
those
statutes
without
hearing.
when
the
lower
court
dismissed
the
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
i
cannot
remember
the
exact
dates
the
insurance
cancellation
and
the
one
this
payment
were
very
close
together.
i
believe
the
missed
payment
was
--
the
first
accident
was
before
the
missed
payment
and
i
believe
the
actual
cancellation
was
after
the
missed
payment.
they
has
not
repossess
at
that
time.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
there
are
two
accidents,
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
is
under
an
obligation
to
keep
the
car
insured
if
not
the
creditor
is
under
an
obligation
to
purchase
the
insurance
and
in
this
case
the
creditor
mercantile
had
not
purchase
the
insurance.
they
had
also
had
not
signed
for
the
release
of
the
automobile
from
the
repair.
he
was
in
the
dispute
with
mercantile
over
the
entire
question
of
this
insurance.
the
insurance
have
been
purchase
for
him
by
the
creditor.
when
the
court
dismissed
the
action
for
lack
of
standing
because
mr.
gonzalez
was
not
in
default,
they
held
that
he
did
not
have
standing
to
adjudicate
the
denial
of
a
prior
hearing
because
if
he
would
have
had
such
a
hearing
he
would
have
prevailed.
they
held
instead
that
only
those
persons
who
would
lost
a
due
process
hearing
have
standing
to
contest
the
fact
that
they
were
denied
such
a
hearing.
as
noted
before,
mr.
gonzalez’
automobile
prior
to
his
intervention
in
this
action
had
been
repossessed,
title
transferred
and
resold.
and
the
court
thereupon
held
that
his
request
for
an
injunction
was
useless
and
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
either
declaratory
or
injunctive
relief.
however,
mr.
gonzales
did
not
request
the
return
of
that
particular
car.
he
sued
to
enjoin
the
future
enforcement
of
the
challenged
statute
and
it
is
this
perspective
relief
that
is
important
and
necessary
to
mr.
gonzalez.
the
repossession
entitled
transfer
statutes
are
still
on
the
books
and
are
still
being
enforced.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
he
is
not.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
has
not
purchase
another
car
on
credit.
with
a
credit
record
already
showing
one
repossession,
mr.
gonzalez
is
particularly
vulnerable
to
these
statutes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
but
this
is
part
of
these
statutes
on
the
presence
of
that
and
their
enforcement
are
part
of
his
continuing
decision
on
whether
or
not
to
purchase
a
car
on
credit
and
if
so
whether
or
not
he
can
maintain
and
enforce
any
rights
that
he
may
have
against
his
creditor.
this
is
the
same
type
of
situation
as
present
and
super
tire
versus
mccorkle,
where
the
strike
had
ended
all
of
the
strikers
went
off
of
welfare
but
if
there
was
ever
another
labor
dispute
the
super
tire
company
knew
that
their
strikers
could
receive
public
aid
payment
but
it
would
have
an
effect
upon
their
labor
negotiations,
it
would
have
an
effect
upon
their
decisions
on
any
negotiating
session.
mr.
gonzalez
is
in
the
same
type
of
situation
particularly
since
he
has
suffered
one
repossession
and
it
is
on
his
credit
record.
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
occasions
when
a
debtor
is
justified
in
not
making
the
payment.
however,
future
creditors
of
mr.
gonzalez
cannot
be
expected
to
tolerate
such
a
happening
whatever
the
reasons.
if
he
moves
in
to
the
situations
he
would
either
have
to
concede
his
rights
vis-à-vis
his
creditor
or
take
the
chance
on
losing
his
car.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
its
not
just
fear
of
a
potential
application.
mr.
gonzalez
has
been
directly
harmed
by
the
operation
of
these
statutes.
it
can
happen
again
if
a
passed
were
on
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
entire
question
of
a
prior
hearing
is
to
avoid
such
an
abuse.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
has
been
paid
for
it.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
sued
instead
of
for
an
injunction
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
having
been
harmed
by
the
statute
he
also
sued
his
representative
of
class
and
the
enforcement
and
execution
of
the
statute
is
still
proceeding
with
regard
to
the
class
having
been
harmed
by
the
operation
of
this
statute
mr.
gonzalez
can
represent
this
class.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
class
are
debtors
under
contracts
of
the
security
interest
whereby
the
creditor
has
the
right
to
repossess
pursuant
to
illinois
law.
if
i
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
if
i
may
get
to
that.
mr.
gonzalez
did
not
sue
for
an
injunction
returning
that
car.
he
sued
for
damages
because
of
that
repossession.
if
he
would
have
had
obtained
an
injunction
from
the
court
returning
that
car
there
would
be
no
question
he
would
have
a
valid
claim.
instead,
he
sued
for
damages
and
mercantile
has
paid
him
damages
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
in
this
court.
and
then
in
this
complaint,
yes
it
was
count
four.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
that
is
the
damage
claim
here.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
has
been
--
they
have
tendered
the
stipulated
maximum
of
the
damage.
he
has
been
paid
pursuant
to
and
accepted
this
complaint.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
he
did.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
for
the
denial
of
the
prior
hearing,
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
what’s
left
is
he
has
been
injured
by
the
statute.
they
are
still
on
the
books.
they
have
a
continuing
effect
upon
his
present
decisions
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
in
monroe
versus
pape,
the
defendants
there
acted
in
direct
violation
of
the
statute
and
the
question
was
whether
when
state
officials
operate
in
violation
of
a
statute
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
and
the
court’s
holding
is
when
they
act
under
color
of
law
pursuant
to
a
statute
that
even
there
violation
of
it.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
is
included
along
with
mercantile
national
bank,
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
there
were
originally
four
defendants,
pardon
me,
four
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
mr.
gonzalez
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
would
put
the
case
in
the
same
posture
if
he
would
have
gotten
an
injunction
getting
his
car
back.
the
burney
case
went
through
a
separate
proceeding,
not
the
case
of
bar
achieving
the
same
result.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
she
proceeded
a
completely
separate
action
apart
from
the
suit
for
the
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
this
case
put
it
in
the
same
situation
as
moore
versus
ogilvie
were
even
though
the
act
has
happened
the
case
is
not
moot.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
i
think
i
would
because
the
defendants
cannot
be
allowed
to
continually
pay
off
individual
plaintiffs
and
particularly
for
plaintiffs
in
order
to
maintain
an
constitutional
system
of
repossession.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
that
is
true.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
response
to
the
question
is
that
having
been
injured
by
the
statute
he
can
sue
to
enjoin
its
future
enforcement
because
the
presence
of
those
laws
on
the
books
continue
to
affect
him
in
his
business
dealings
of
whether
or
not
to
purchase
a
car
on
credit
and
if
so
whether
or
not
he
maintain
--
he
can
maintain
his
rights
against
his
creditors.
it
is
in
that
respect
no
different
then
super
tire
versus
mccorkle
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
(voice
overlap)
the
other
plaintiffs
are
not
a
party
to
this
court.
for
example,
mr.
moe
he
could
do
the
original
plaintiff
due
to
illness
in
his
family
as
we
took
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
okay,
mr.
gonzalez
is
the
only
plaintiff.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
only
the
claim
for
damage
as
the
claim
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
i
might
add
that
this
case
was
brought
in
two
counts,
one
against
the
creditor
and
one
against
the
secretary
of
state.
the
claim
against
the
secretary
of
state
can
stand
on
its
own
regardless
of
being
attached
to
a
claim
against
the
creditor.
this
is
on
the
certificate
transferred
at
this
certificate
of
title.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
there
was
never
damage
claim
against
the
secretary
of
state.
he
is
a
state
official
acting
pursuant
to
state
statutes
and
i
believe
that
the
damage
claim
would
not
lie
on
federal
court
under
edelman
versus
jordan.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
it
did
not.
in
fact
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
--
it
referred
only
to
the
count
four.
it
did
not
even
refer
to
the
count
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
against
mercantile.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
change
in
rule
by
the
secretary
of
state
was
accomplished
in
order
to
avoid
the
temporary
restraining
order
in
this
case.
it
is
a
mere
administrative
procedural
change.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
pardon?
they
are
still
on
operation
but
they
can
be
as
easily
shifted
back
from
morning
after
this
litigation
as
they
were
instituted.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
i
am
not
satisfied
with
them?
mr.
james
o.
latturner
because
under
the
present
rules
the
secretary
of
state
has
delegated
what
should
be
his
duties
and
responsibilities
to
the
creditor.
thus,
the
notice
of
the
proposed
application
for
the
new
certificate
of
title
is
drafted
and
sent
by
the
creditor.
the
creditor
drafts
a
propose
affidavit
of
defense
that
may
be
sent
back
in.
the
affidavit
of
the
debtor
files
had
they
sent
not
to
the
secretary
of
state
but
to
the
creditor.
the
creditor
then
can
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
a
valid
affidavit
of
defense
and
if
he
rejects
it
can
then
apply
for
a
new
certificate
of
title
stating
that
an
affidavit
was
not
receive.
there
is
never
any
hearing
or
notice
sent
by
the
secretary.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
i
think
you
have
to
determine
whether
the
case
is
properly
here
first.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
i
was
getting
to
them.
i
notice
my
time
has
expired.
i
would
like
to
--
well,
pardon
me,
let
me
stay
with
those
for
a
moment.
secretary
--
the
action
was
brought
against
the
state
official,
the
secretary
of
state
suing
to
enjoin
him
from
the
enforcement
and
execution
of
state
statute
of
statewide
application,
termination,
and
transfer
provisions
to
the
illinois
motor
vehicle
code
pursuant
to
because
they
violate
due
process.
thus,
all
of
the
technical
requirements
of
2281
are
met.
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
substantial
constitutional
question
against
the
secretary.
mercantile
alleges
that
the
secretary
is
not
the
actual
means
of
enforcement
of
those
statutes
but
that
argument
could
not
be
more
incorrect.
he
is
the
only
means
of
enforcement
of
those
statutes.
mercantile
also
alleges
that
he
is
only
a
nominal
defendant
because
the
certificates
of
title
and
their
transfer
are
meaningless
and
ministerial.
however,
the
state
of
the
illinois
by
another
statutory
provision
provides
for
due
process
protection
to
certificates
of
title
in
all
instances
except
when
it’s
terminated
after
repossession.
in
all
other
instances
before
the
secretary
of
state
can
involuntarily
terminate
a
certificate
of
title
he
must
send
notice,
he
must
set
a
hearing,
he
must
issue
subpoenas,
he
must
hold
the
hearing,
and
his
decision
is
subject
to
jurisdiction
review.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
it
was.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
no,
it
could
not.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
under
idlewild
versus
epstein
when
an
application
for
a
three-judge
court
is
made
the
single
judge
must
look
to
see
if
the
technical
requirements
are
met
and
at
the
substantial
constitutional
question
is
allege
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
state
officer,
state
statute
of
statewide
application.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
questions
of
standing
and
mootness
are
more
properly
decided
by
three-judge
courts.
in
the
past
they
have
been
and
this
court
has
accepted
numerous
of
those
cases
on
direct
appeal.
in
making
the
determination
as
to
standing
in
this
case,
it
required
an
analysis
of
the
statute
by
the
three-judge
court.
they
went
in
reaching
a
standing
issue
into
the
statutory
scheme
itself.
it
was
not
a
cursory
analysis
at
the
very
beginning.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
it
did
not
require.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct,
they
did
not
reach
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
because
the
three-judge
--
when
there
is
an
application
for
a
three-judge
court
the
single
judge
does
not
have
power
to
either
grant
or
withhold
relief.
he
is
specifically
by
2284
sub
paragraph
5
cannot
dismiss
the
action.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
if
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
question,
the
proper
procedure
is
to
convene
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
okay.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
--
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
can
only
decide
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
question.
if
he
determines
there
is
no
substantial
constitutional
question
he
can
dismiss
the
case.
if
he
determines
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
question
he
must
convene
the
three-judge
court
to
determine
all
of
the
other
issues
which
may
result
in
either
the
granting
or
denial
of
relief.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
he
would
have
that
power
if
he
made
such
a
holding.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
it
basically
comes
down
to
how
far
deeply
into
the
statute
and
then
to
the
case
they
have
to
go
and
many
questions
concerning
standing
or
mootness
go
very
hard.
in
this
case,
for
the
mootness
they
went
to
the
ultimate
issue
in
the
case
whether
or
not
an
injunction
should
issue.
clearly,
the
single
judge
could
not
dismiss
on
the
grounds
dismissed
here
because
it
involved
the
direct
explicit
denial
of
an
injunction.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
first
counsel
indicates
this
is
my
case
and
that
mr.
gonzalez’
case
that
is
totally
incorrect.
i
have
been
indicated
this
morning
the
interest
that
mr.
gonzalez
has
in
the
resolution
of
the
question
presented
here.
that
resolution
is
important
enough
for
him
that
he
has
personally
born
across
at
this
appeal.
this
is
his
case
i
am
representing
him
as
his
attorney.
secondly,
mr.
brennan
referred
to
the
time
spent
--
mr.
justice
brennan
referred
to
the
time
spent
on
jurisdictional
questions.
since
1960,
this
court
has
taken
on
direct
appeal
nine
cases
in
the
same
procedural
posture
as
this
court
is
this
case.
a
three-judge
district
court
has
been
properly
convened
and
has
dismissed
the
case
without
going
to
the
ultimate
issue.
overruling
that
well-established
rule
is
not
going
to
lessen
the
burdens
on
this
court
its
going
to
increase
it.
you
were
going
to
be
face
with
a
proliferation
of
the
cases
having
to
do
what
this
court’s
jurisdiction.
the
direct
appeal
rule
in
this
instance
is
one
of
the
few
areas
and
the
three-judge
court
litigation
practice
which
is
well
settled.
it
should
stay
that
way.
overruling
it
would
create
additional
confusion
and
new
burdens
for
both
courts
and
litigants
alike.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
correct.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
mr.
justice
stewart
this
case
is
in
the
same
procedural
position
now
as
fuentes
versus
shevin
was
when
this
court
reached
its
opinion
there.
in
fuentes,
the
property
of
the
plaintiffs
had
already
been
replevied.
it
was
gone.
they
did
not
get
the
property
back.
they
sued
to
enjoin
the
future
enforcement
and
execution
of
the
replevin
statutes.
mr.
gonzalez’
automobile
has
been
repossessed.
it
is
gone
he
will
not
get
it
back.
he
has
sued
to
enjoin
the
future
enforces
(voice
overlap).
mr.
james
o.
latturner
the
fuentes’
plaintiffs
did
not
request
damages.
they
sued
only
for
the
future
enforcement
there.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
it
would
not
go
to
the
injunctive
relief
that
the
question
pending
them
both
cases
is
the
future
enforcement
because
of
the
effect
that
this
is
going
to
the
continuing
enforcement
was
held
on
the
plaintiffs
and
the
class
they
represent.
the
payment
to
the
individual
plaintiff
here
does
not
affect
either
of
those
issues.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
yes,
this
case
is
on
that
question
has
so
held
in
lynch
versus
household
finance
that
the
dismissal
of
the
case
as
a
denial
of
all
relief
requesting
including
the
injunction
that
comes
here
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
james
o.
latturner
that
is
correct.
thank
you.
