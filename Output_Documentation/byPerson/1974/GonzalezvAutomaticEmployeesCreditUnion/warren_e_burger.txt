chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-858
gonzalez
against
automatic
employees
credit.
mr.
latturner,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
other
remedy
available
to
him
under
state
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
conversion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
prevail,
what
relief
would
he
now
receive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
--
do
then
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
you
relate
this
for
me
at
least
to
a
particular
automobile
that
he
lost?
it
might
get
him
back
his
automobile?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
the
proceedings
under
and
pursuant
to
the
statute
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
what’s
left?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
just
pointed
out
and
i
think
someone
else
did
it
was
not
the
use
of
the
statute
but
the
abuse
of
it
and
misused
of
it.
we’re
operating
under
the
statute
they’re
operating
outside
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
sue
some
state
official
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
included
along
with
automatic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
did
he
pay
any
damages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
were
all
the
claims
against
all
the
defendants
settled
by
your
disposition,
your
settlement
which
you
described?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
nobody
can
tell
them
to
take
this
settlement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
what’s
--
then
what’s
left
of
your
response
to
the
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
get
back
to
my
earlier
question
which
you
have
not
completely
answered.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
automatic,
i
assume
it
is
automatic
who
paid
the
mercantile
--
mercantile
paid
the
settlement,
did
that
discharge
all
the
defendants
from
all
liability
under
1983?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
talking
about
the
people
who
are
still
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
are
all
his
claims
against
all
the
name
of
the
defendants
washed
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
the
damage
claims?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
all
washed
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
still
had
a
damage
claim
against
the
secretary
of
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
settlement
agreement
that
were
signed
when
the
check
was
delivered
recited
generally
as
done
at
all
claims
of
every
kind
in
nature
wash
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
was
submitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
decide
that
there
is
no
case
that
it’s
moot,
are
you
telling
us
that
a
single
judge
could
not
dismiss
it
as
moot?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
not
quite
an
answer
to
my
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
the
single
judge
could
not
dismiss
it
if
he
decided
that
there
was
lawsuit
there
any
longer,
there
was
no
case
or
controversy
lives
in
existence
so
that
the
case
was
moot
and
dismiss?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
has
no
power
are
you
telling
us
that
--
to
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
he
decided
and
recited
that
he
was
holding
that
there
was
no
substantial
constitutional
question
because
there
was
no
live
case
or
controversy
and
that
it
was
moot,
he’d
have
that
power
wouldn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
comes
down
to
a
question
of
semantics
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
jenner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
there
right
after
lunch,
mr.
jenner.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
jenner,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
without
any
argument
from
anyone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
they
feel
aggrieved.
if
the
plaintiff
feels
aggrieved,
he
can
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
they
agree
with
him
and
then
they
send
it
back
and
direct
the
convening
of
the
three-judge
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that’s
why
you
said
you
had
three
bullets
in
your
gun
standing
jurisdiction,
first
standing,
and
mootness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
latturner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-858
gonzalez
against
automatic
employees
credit.
mr.
latturner,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

warren
e.

was
there
any
other
remedy
available
to

under
state
law?
chief

e.

chief

warren
e.
burger
if
you
prevail,
what
relief
would
he
now
receive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
--
do
then
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
you
relate
this
for
me
at
least
to
a
particular
automobile
that
he
lost?
it
might
get
him
back
his
automobile?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
the
proceedings
under
and
pursuant
to
the
statute
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
what’s
left?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
but
as
mr.
justice
stewart
just
pointed
out
and
i
think
someone
else
did
it
was
not
the
use
of
the
statute
but
the
abuse
of
it
and
misused
of
it.
we’re
operating
under
the
statute
they’re
operating
outside
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
sue
some
state
official
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
included
along
with
automatic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
did
he
pay
any
damages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
were
all
the
claims
against
all
the
defendants
settled
by
your
disposition,
your
settlement
which
you
described?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
nobody
can
tell
them
to
take
this
settlement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
what’s
--
then
what’s
left
of
your
response
to
the
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
get
back
to
my
earlier
question
which
you
have
not
completely
answered.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
automatic,
i
assume
it
is
automatic
who
paid
the
mercantile
--
mercantile
paid
the
settlement,
did
that
discharge
all
the
defendants
from
all
liability
under
1983?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
anything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
talking
about
the
people
who
are
still
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
are
all
his
claims
against
all
the
name
of
the
defendants
washed
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
the
damage
claims?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
are
all
washed
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
still
had
a
damage
claim
against
the
secretary
of
state?
chief

warren
e.

would
it

chief

burger
it
has
no
power
are
you
telling
us
that
--
to
do
that?
chief

warren
e.

well
if

holding
that
there
was
no

there
was
no

chief

that
comes
down
