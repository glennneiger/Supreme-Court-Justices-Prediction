unknown
speaker
what
had
happened
to
mr.
gonzalez
in
any
state
proceedings?
his
car
had
been
seized?
unknown
speaker
and
had
all
these
happened
to
mr.
gonzalez
and
his
automobile?
unknown
speaker
and
what
remedies
if
any
had
he
been
given
on
the
state?
unknown
speaker
if
you
lawsuit
boils
down
now
to
the
proposition
that
you
just
feel
chilled
if
you
will
by
the
existence
of
this
repossession
statute
on
the
books.
you
run
on
to
cases
don’t
you
like
boyle
against
landry
where
even
where
first
amendment
interests
were
allegedly
involved
and
even
were
the
statute
concern
were
criminal
statutes.
the
court
said
that
just
the
fear
of
a
potential
application
of
those
criminal
laws
in
sometime
in
the
future
by
the
chicago
police
department,
this
case
came
from
your
same
circuit,
was
in
sufficient
to
create
a
controversy.
unknown
speaker
as
pointed
out
by
the
three-judge
district
court
he
has
a
state
remedy
for
that
harm
because
it
was
the
abuse
of
the
statute
not
the
proper
application
statute,
isn’t
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
he
doesn’t
want
his
car
back
now
you’ve
told?
unknown
speaker
he
has
been
paid
for
it.
unknown
speaker
and
so
now
his
cause
of
action
remaining
if
any
is
controversy
with
the
state
is
where
the
presence
on
the
books
of
these
statutes,
isn’t
that
it
that
he
fears
maybe
invoked
in
the
future
by
some
future
as
any
of
his
installment
contract
if
he
sometime
in
the
future
may
buy
an
automobile
on
credit?
unknown
speaker
mr.
latturner,
can
i
just
tell
you
a
second.
he’s
been
paid
for
the
car?
unknown
speaker
where
did
they
sue
for
damages?
unknown
speaker
as
well
as
--
is
part
of
your
damage
claims
that
the
car
was
taken
without
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
or
he
has
settled
with?
unknown
speaker
and
he
accepted
it?
unknown
speaker
in
full
for
all
of
his
1983
damage?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
latturner
may
i
ask?
i
had
it
appreciated
but
he
had
been
compensated
for
his
full
damage
claim.
does
that
put
this
case
in
the
posture
of
the
burney
case,
are
you
familiar
with
that?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
she
got
her
full
payment.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
defendant
said,
the
minute
you
filed
your
complaint,
said
you’re
dead
right,
we’ll
give
you
everything
you
ask
right
now.
i
suppose
you
wouldn’t
be
in
a
very
good
shape
to
litigate
up
to
this
one,
would
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask
was
there
any
negotiations
and
connection
with
that
settlement
that
you
dismissed
this
suit?
unknown
speaker
none
that
was
being
asked
for
by
mercantile?
unknown
speaker
they
paid
the
full
amount
without
--
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
we
decided
that
we
thought
the
case
was
moot.
would
we
--
should
we
take
action
on
that
or
should
we
determine
whether
the
case
is
properly
here
in
this
court
at
all?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
question
of
whether
this
case
was
required
to
be
heard
by
three-judge
court
and
whether
even
it
was
it’s
properly
here
are
issues
that
are
threshold
issues?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
say
something
about
that?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you?
could
the
determination
that
the
court
the
district
court
that
was
made
by
three-judge
court?
unknown
speaker
could
that
determination
with
respect
to
standing
have
been
made
by
a
single
judge?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
couldn’t
the
single
judge
left
the
complaint
and
say
to
it
and
decide
there
is
no
standing
in
this
case
without
getting
to
these
three-judge
court
questions?
unknown
speaker
well
what
about
quite
technical
requirements,
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
proper
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn’t
require
any
ruling
on
validity?
unknown
speaker
it
just
required
the
construction
for
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
question
was
required
about
a
three-judge
court?
why
is
the
three-judge
court
required
for
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jenner,
tell
me
something
about
that
settlement,
how
come
you
didn’t
get
one
to
dismiss
it?
unknown
speaker
maybe
i
should
have
put
it
this
way.
practical
lawyer
like
you
how
do
you
come
settle
the
case
full
amount
of
the
damage
claim
without
getting
the
whole
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
but
nevertheless,
did
i
understand
that
damage
settlement
or
damage
payment
was
satisfaction
of
all
kinds
of
damage
that
might
have
resulted
to
this
taking?
unknown
speaker
and
damage
that
might
have
resulted
from
taking
without
notice
as
well
the
cost
of
the
car?
unknown
speaker
that
does
raise
a
burney
question,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
raises
a
burney
question
then
doesn’t
it
--
you
know
the
lady
who
had
a
claim
which
for
the
case
brought
here
was
fully
satisfied
by
complete
payment
of
burney
of
indiana?
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
argue
about
the
three-judge
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it’s
essential
that’s
if
--
do
you
think
that
we
should
determine
whether
we
have
jurisdiction
here?
unknown
speaker
is
that
said
mootness
or
just
standing?
unknown
speaker
or
was
that
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
because
it’s
moot?
unknown
speaker
would
suppose
single
judge?
unknown
speaker
so
how
do
we
decide
if
you
didn’t
argue?
that’s
why
lawyers
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
how
could
we
decide
if
you
didn’t
argue?
unknown
speaker
well,
on
direct
--
if
direct
appeals
are
only
from
cases
--
in
cases
that
must
be
tried
by
three-judge
court.
it
must
be
decided
by
three-judge
not
that
are
but
must
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
this
be
even
if
in
the
three-judge
court
will
properly
convene
that
judgment
they’ve
entered
is
not
directly
appealed,
is
that
your?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
the
three-judge
court
will
convene,
it
looked
at
all
and
said,
well
this
is
a
frivolous
constitutional
question
that
the
federal
district
court
has
no
jurisdiction
dismissed,
that
goes
to
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
a
lot
of
time
mr.
jenner
we
spent
on
deciding
whether
or
not
the
case
should
be
here
or
shouldn’t?
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn’t
think
the
three-judge
court
didn’t
act
on
the
basis
the
car
have
been
sold
and
he
then
that
he
had
settles
that
he
did
it
here?
unknown
speaker
that
isn’t
what
the
three-judge
court
decided?
the
three-judge
court
decided
to
stand
because
he
said
that
he
wasn’t
in
default
in
which
you
got
the
other
remedy
under
that
statute
namely
then?
unknown
speaker
and
so
there
couldn’t
be
any
so-called
constitutional
claim
resulting
in
an
injunction.
no
standing
to
ask
for
that
kind
of
relief.
you’re
not
arguing
that
here,
your
not
sustaining
that
for
reason
i
take
it?
would
you
really
try
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
were
right
on
that
basis?
unknown
speaker
before
any
settlement
of
the
damage
claim?
unknown
speaker
that
just
because
there
is
a
damage
remedy
under
the
statute
for
an
improper
or
wrongful
taking,
that
there
is
no
standing
to
bring
this
three-judge
court
action
and
ask
for
injunction
having
and
ask
the
statute
to
return
in
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
well
isn’t
that
not
position
contrary
to
the
--
what
this
court
did
and
the
three-judge
court
did
in
the
fuentes
against
shevin
at
least
with
the
respect
that
pennsylvania
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
well
that’s
a
different
question.
(voice
overlap)
i’m
talking
about
--
unknown
speaker
assume
it’s
a
court’s
decision?
unknown
speaker
in
fuentes
as
this
court
held
particularly
with
respect
to
the
pennsylvania
plaintiffs,
i
don’t
have
it
too
clearly
in
mind
but
i
seem
to
remember
that
there
was
a
nomination
that
based
on
a
part
of
the
woman
plaintiff
that
they’re
going
to
wrongful
taking
there
but
that
didn’t
stop
the
three-judge
court
from
allowing
her
to
attack
the
constitutionality
and
the
basic
repossession
statutes,
in
order
to
stop
this
court
from
reviewing
it.
they
might
mistaken,
is
there
a
difference,
maybe
there
is?
unknown
speaker
is
it
because
that’s
have
since?
unknown
speaker
but
no
settlement?
unknown
speaker
the
report
said.
of
course,
he
has
a
damage
remedy
under
the
statute
there's
nothing
for
us
to
decide
here.
he
has
no
standing
in
this
suit
which
is
(inaudible).
i
suppose
mr.
jenner
even
if
hard
as
you
try
you
can't
persuade
us
that
they
were
right
and
adequate.
i
gather
you’re
here
in
a
position
where
you
can
defend
this
judgment
since
you
are
the
respondent
or
appellate
in
any
ground
that’s
available
to
you
and
that
was
suppose
to
judgment
settlement
intervening
today
--
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
have
to
fight
too
hard
to
defend
what
they
did
below.
unknown
speaker
he’s
been
made
whole
and
fuentes’
plaintiffs
have
not
been
made
whole.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
it’s
not
the
same
as
difference.
unknown
speaker
what
had
happened
to
mr.
gonzalez
in
any
state
proceedings?
his
car
had
been
seized?
unknown
speaker
and
had
all
these
happened
to
mr.
gonzalez
and
his
automobile?
unknown
speaker
and
what
remedies
if
any
had
he
been
given
on
the
state?
unknown
speaker
if
you
lawsuit
boils
down
now
to
the
proposition
that
you
just
feel
chilled
if
you
will
by
the
existence
of
this

statute
on

you

said
that

because
it
was
the

isn’t
that
correct?
unknown

but
he
doesn’t
want
his
car
back
now
you’ve
told?
unknown
speaker
he
has
been
paid
for
it.
unknown
speaker
and
so
now
his
cause
of
action
remaining
if
any
is
controversy
with
the
state
is
where
the
presence
on
the
books
of

on

unknown
speaker
mr.
latturner,
can
i
just
tell
you
a
second.
he’s
been
paid
for
the
car?
unknown
speaker
where
did
they
sue
for
damages?
unknown
speaker
as
well
as
--
is
part
of
your
damage
claims
that
the
car
was
taken
without
a
hearing?
unknown
speaker
or
he
has
settled
with?
unknown
speaker
and
he
accepted
it?
unknown
speaker
in
full
for
all
of
his
1983
damage?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
mr.
latturner
may
i
ask?
i
had
it
appreciated
but
he
had
been
compensated
for
his
full
damage
claim.
does
that
put
this
case
in
the
posture
of
the
burney
case,
are
you
familiar
with
that?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
she
got
her
full
payment.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
defendant
said,
the
minute
you
filed
your
complaint,
said
you’re

we’ll
give
you
everything
you

i

you
wouldn’t
be
in
a
very

unknown

may
i
ask
was
there
any

with
that

that
you
dismissed
this
suit?
unknown
speaker
none
that
was
being
asked
for

unknown

they
paid
the
full
amount
without
--
unknown

let's
assume
we
decided
that

the

would

on
that
or
should
we
determine
whether
the

is

so
that
the

whether
this

was
required
to
be
heard
by
three-judge

and
whether
even
it
was
it’s

are

are
you
going

can
i
ask
you?
could
the
determination
that
the

the

was

unknown
speaker
could
that
determination
with
respect
to
standing
have
been
made
by
a

unknown
speaker
you
mean,
couldn’t
the
single

left
the
complaint
and
say
to
it
and
decide
there
is
no

in

reason
i
take
it?
would
you
really
try
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
they
were
right
on
that
basis?
unknown
speaker
before
any
settlement
of
the
damage
claim?
unknown
speaker
that
just
because
there
is
a
damage
remedy
under
the
statute
for
an
improper
or
wrongful
taking,
that
there
is
no
standing
to
bring
this
three-judge
court
action
and
ask
for
injunction
having
and
ask
the
statute
to
return
in
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
well
isn’t
that
not
position
contrary
to
the
--
what
this
court
did
and
the
three-judge
court
did
in
the
fuentes
against
shevin
at
least
with
the
respect
that
pennsylvania
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
well
that’s
a
different
question.
(voice
overlap)
i’m
talking
about
--
unknown
speaker
assume
it’s
a
court’s
decision?
unknown
speaker
in
fuentes
as
this
court
held
particularly
with
respect
to
the
pennsylvania
plaintiffs,
i
don’t
have
it
too
clearly
in
mind
but
i
seem
to
remember
that
there
was
a
nomination
that
based
on
a
part
of
the
woman
plaintiff
that
they’re
going
to
wrongful
taking
there
but
that
didn’t
stop
the
three-judge
court
from
allowing
her
to
attack
the
constitutionality
and
the
basic
repossession
statutes,
in
order
to
stop
this
court
from
reviewing
it.
they
might
mistaken,
is
there
a
difference,
maybe
there
is?
unknown
speaker
is
it
because
that’s
have
since?
unknown
speaker
but
no
settlement?
unknown
speaker
the
report
said.
of
course,
he
has
a
damage
remedy
under
the
statute
there's
nothing
for
us
to
decide
here.
he
has
no
standing
in
this
suit
which
is
(inaudible).
i
suppose
mr.
jenner
even
if
hard
as
you
try
you
can't
persuade
us
that
they
were
right
and
adequate.
i
gather
you’re
here
in
a
position
where
you
can
defend
this
judgment
since
you
are
the
respondent
or
appellate
in
any
ground
that’s
available
to
you
and
that
was
suppose
to
judgment
settlement
intervening
today
--
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
have
to
fight
too
hard
to
defend
what
they
did
below.
unknown
speaker
he’s
been
made
whole
and
fuentes’
plaintiffs
have
not
been
made
whole.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
it’s
not
the
same
as
difference.
