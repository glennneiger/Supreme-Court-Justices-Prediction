mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
there
was
a
damage
claim
and
the
amount
of
the
damage
claim
was
out
of
way
determined
to
be
$750.00.
a
tender
was
made
of
the
$750.00.
that
damage
of
claim
was
a
subject
of
one
of
the
counts,
i’ve
forgotten
the
number.
that
count
was
solely
of
damages.
so
that
the
issue
of
damages
with
respect
to
the
alleged
tort
on
the
part
of
mercantile
in
the
seizing
by
so-called
the
automobile
when
there
was
no
default.
that
is
per
the
pleadings
there
was
no
default
and
the
district
--
the
three-judge
court
taking
the
matter
on
the
pleadings
rule
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
default
so
that
that
issue
is
out
because
that
was
settle
perhaps.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
that
didn’t
happen
at
the
end
of
that
particular
time
but
i
would
have
done
exactly
what
my
partners
did
and
that
is
because
at
that
particular
point
that
was
the
only
viable
issue
on
the
case
and
when
that
was
settled
there
was
no
longer
any
case
for
controversy
presented
here.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan
that
has
always
been
my
practice
in
44
years
but
if
i
can't
get
that
kind
of
agreement
i
get
the
best
i
can
get
and
that’s
really
what
the
answer
is
here.
may
it
please,
your
honors.
there
is
the
threshold
issue
of
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
at
all
which
i
will
discuss.
that
then
follows
whether
the
case
is
moot
for
which
i
will
also
discuss
and
also
whether
the
plaintiff
has
standing.
there
is
a
measure
of
confusion
with
respect
to
what
the
facts
are
here
and
cases
are
best
determined
on
the
facts
and
may
i
--
and
hopeful
be
helpful
to
the
court
and
review
just
for
a
minute
of
two
or
four
or
five
minutes
of
my
time
as
to
the
facts
in
the
case.
first,
this
isn’t
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
of
sections
503,
504
and
507
of
the
uniform
commercial
code.
as
this
court
knows,
the
illinois
uniform
commercial
code
is
the
most
pure
of
all
the
codes
in
the
49
states
and
in
the
virgin
islands,
and
especially
503,
504,
and
507
are
the
original
code.
this
is
article
ix
503,
504,
507
was
reexamined
by
the
american
law
institute
and
by
the
uniform
law
commissioners
in
1972
and
the
whole
chapter
was
rewritten.
so
that
you
have
presented
here
a
carefully
thought-out
and
considered
system
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
motor
vehicles
repossessions
and
effort
on
the
part
of
the
america
law
institute
and
the
commissioners
to
prepare
a
--
and
have
a
system
which
comports
as
near
as
maybe
and
sensibly
with
due
process.
now
this
503,
504,
and
507,
may
your
honors
please
is
before
you
on
applications
for
certiorari
in
several
cases
which
your
honors
have
deferred
presumably
awaiting
the
argument
of
this
particular
case.
so
that
the
merits
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
self-help
repossession
provisions
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
are
waiting
your
decision
as
whether
you
will
accept
on
certiorari
the
several,
i
think
there
are
four
maybe
five
that
are
now
pending
before
you
which
you
haven’t
acted
on.
the
important
here
is
the
fact
that
that
issue
was
not
determined
by
the
district
court
or
the
three-judge
court
here
at
all.
the
merits
are
unconstitutionality
if
have
been
unconstitutional
of
503,
504,
and
507
is
not
before
the
court.
the
dismissal
here
was
on
currently
procedural
grounds.
now,
mr.
gonzalez
purchased
this
pontiac
used
car
on
the
22nd
of
january
1972.
he
made
a
downpayment
and
then
he
was
to
pay
15
monthly
installments
thereafter
of
a
$120.74
commencing
on
the
28th
of
february
of
the
following
month.
he
paid
that
first
installment.
he
paid
none
other
to
this
day
at
any
time.
now,
the
contract
provided
consistent
with
sections
503,
504,
and
507
that
on
default,
the
creditor
was
entitled
to
re
--
make
repossession
with
or
without
traditional
process
the
contract
expressly
so
provide.
sections
503
and
504
as
has
been
said
on
all
of
the
cases
there
are
now
pending
before
you
on
certiorari.
a
pure
codification
of
the
old
common
law
that
you
may
enter
into
a
contract
of
self-help
possession
upon
a
proper
default,
this
contract
was
assigned
to
mercantile
by
the
used
car
dealer.
now,
mr.
gonzalez
was
involved
into
automobile
accidents
one
on
march
26,
1972,
one
on
april
16
1972
resulting
in
repairs
that
had
to
be
paid
of
$542.68.
the
insurance
company
only
paid
$322.00.
on
april
18th,
the
insurance
company
in
the
face
of
two
accidents
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wouldn’t
want
the
members
of
this
court
think
that
i
was
having
the
client
pay
money
to
settle
a
particular
claim
without
some
good
reason.
on
the
16th
of
august
1973,
the
district
court
three-judge
court
entered
and
order
dismissing
the
entire
case
as
moot.
that
decision
was
correct
as
i
will,
i
think
successfully
argue.
there
remain
however
the
damage
claim
count
four
and
while
since
the
issues
involving
constitutionality
and
the
injunction
under
the
conjunction
act
were
moot
and
the
damage
claim
would
then
draw
up
also
i
was
concern
that
that
particular
matter
still
remain
at
large
and
that
this
was
in
the
nature
that
we
knew
with
my
distinguished
and
able,
dedicated
opponent
had
in
mind
making
this
a
test
case,
that
the
record
should
be
made
clean.
since
he
would
not
agree
to
dismiss
the
whole
case
and
the
payment
of
the
$750.00,
we
just
want
to
have
and
paid
it
and
that
at
least
dropped
that
one
possible
viable
claim
and
that
was
the
reasons.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
it
did.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
alleged
wrongful
taking.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
oh!
the
burney
case,
yes
and
i
have
tend
to
advert
to
that
if
i
may
in
a
moment
or
two.
may
i
also
say
if
your
honors
please,
i
did
mention
that
the
constitutional
issue
is
not
involved
here.
as
the
case
was
dismissed
for
mootness,
i
did
advert
to
the
fact
that
there
are
several
petitions
for
certiorari
pending
before
this
court.
in
that
connection,
there
are
eight
decisions
of
courts
of
appeal
in
this
nation
and
all
of
which
sections
503,
504,
507
were
sustained
--
have
been
sustained
us
to
constitutionality.
those
eight
cases
are
in
sixth
courts
of
appeals,
the
ninth,
eighth,
the
fifth,
the
third,
the
sixth
and
the
second.
five
of
those
eight
cases
are
pending
on
certiorari
in
this
court.
in
the
first
of
those
cases
that
is
adams
versus
southern
california
first
national
bank.
the
permanent
editorial
board
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
consisting
as
you
know
of
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i'm
not
going
to
argue
about
the
three-judge
court
because
we
did
not
go
over
nor
did
we
contend
that
the
three-judge
court
was
improperly
convened.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
and
may
i
turn
directly
to
that
point?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
finishing
if
i
may
mr.
justice
white
of
the
facts
so
we’ll
have
the
perspective.
the
insurance
company
cancelled
the
insurance
on
the
18th
of
april
with
respect
to
the
two
accidents
one
occurring
on
march
and
one
occurring
in
april,
and
rebated
$229.94
of
the
unearned
premium.
the
repairs
were
$542.68.
mercantile
repossessed
the
repaired
automobile
on
the
25th
of
april
and
paid
the
repairmen
at
that
particular
time,
his
repair
bill
of
$542.00
so
was
required
taking
of
possession.
now,
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
since
the
case
was
disposed
of
on
the
pleadings.
it
is
alleged
on
the
complaint
that
mr.
gonzalez
was
not
in
default
at
the
time
of
the
repossession.
if
you
take
the
figures,
it
would
appear
that
probably
not
so,
that
he
was
in
fact
in
default
but
for
the
disposition
of
this
case
the
case
was
taken
on
the
plea
and
so
it
is
presumed
on
the
plaintiffs.
there’ve
been
no
proof
taken
on
this
case
at
whatsoever
that
at
the
time
of
the
repossession
mr.
gonzalez
was
not
on
default
so
as
a
--
on
the
pleadings
it
was
a
wrongful
taking.
so
it
was
a
breach
of
503
and
504
because
503
and
504
permits
self-help
only
if
there
is
a
default
under
the
contract.
the
mercantile
having
repossessed
under
the
illinois
statutes
dealing
with
issuances
of
certificate
of
title
which
do
not
affect
--
those
certificates
do
not
in
fact
affect
actual
title
and
the
statute
so
provides.
the
certificate
of
title
is
issued
for
the
purpose
of
recording
for
keeping
track
of
the
car
from
a
police
standpoint
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
driver’s
license
and
that
kind
of
made.
it’s
a
ministerial
act.
a
repossession
license
was
issued
under
the
illinois
statute
here
again
not
affecting
actual
title.
now,
notice
of
the
sale
of
the
automobile
use
repaired
used
car
was
given
to
mr.
gonzalez
by
registered
man.
he
did
not
act,
took
no
action
whatsoever
and
the
automobile
is
then
sold
to
a
bona
fide
purchaser
and
that
bona
fide
purchaser
acquire
actual
title,
as
provided
under
the
statute
and
also
under
the
common
law.
that
purchase
in
turn
sold
to
a
second
party.
now,
whether
the
automobile
will
be
sold
again,
we
don’t
know
but
at
least
we
know
of
those
two
sales
that
are
all
alleged
in
the
pleadings.
now,
after
all
this
had
occurred
--
after
all
of
this
had
occurred
mr.
gonzalez
then
intervene
in
a
pending
suit,
the
mojica
suit
which
is
not
involve
here
and
for
the
first
time
on
september
28,
1972
after
all
these
months
that
time
had
passed
he
filed
the
intervening
complaint
which
is
a
subject
matter
before
your
honors
on
this
particular
case.
so
at
that
particular
time,
the
title
of
the
car
could
not
be
reclaimed
in
any
form
or
fashion
or
otherwise.
no
relief
sought
the
three-judge
district
court
unless
we
urge
it,
no
relief
whatsoever
could
be
granted
to
mr.
gonzalez
at
the
time
he
filed
his
suit
that
would
be
of
any
possible
benefit
to
it.
now,
to
a
dedicated
and
able
young
lawyer
as
mr.
latturner
is
with
the
legal
services
group
in
uptown
chicago,
it
appeared
to
him
that
here
was
a
case
in
which
issue,
broad
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
re.
self-help
repossession
provisions
could
be
obtained.
and
so
he
filed
the
claim
with
that
particular
time.
now,
the
district
court
three-judge
dismissed
this
case
because
of
mootness
and
lack
of
standing
and
that’s
the
first
point
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mootness
and
standing,
both
dismissed
because
of
mootness
and
lack
of
standing.
having
done
that,
it
is
the
position
-
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
lack
of
a
case
or
controversy
--
lack
of
a
case
or
controversy,
mootness
and
lack
of
standing
in
the
sense
of
the
absence
of
the
right
of
the
plaintiff
to
maintain
the
suit
in
his
own
name
and
the
suit
on
behalf
of
the
alleged
class.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
direct
appeal
under
the
three-judge
act
to
this
court
forcing
this
court
to
accept
the
case
or
on
examination
of
the
jurisdictional
service.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
because
under
--
one
of
the
counts
of
the
complaint,
the
secretary
of
state
of
illinois
was
made
a
party
defendant
as
purely
nominal
party
as
you
will
notice
the
attorney
general
lawyer
is
not
before
this
court
and
the
secretary
of
state
is
not
before
this
court.
they
just
ignored
the
case.
having
the
secretary
of
state
as
a
party
defendant,
we
say
nominally
it
is
the
position
of
counsel
for
mr.
gonzalez
that
that
involve
state
action
to
bring
the
case
within
the
injunction
provisions.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no
i
don’t,
i
mean
that
his
function
here
is
so
peripheral
that
is
issuing
a
certificate
of
title.
that
is
it
is
ministerial
act
of
issuing
the
certificate
of
title
when
advice
following
a
sale
or
repossession
that
the
automobile
has
sold
--
been
sold
are
now
is
in
the
good
title
in
someone
else
and
the
statute
defines
it
expressly
that
only
when
the
secretary
of
state
is
in
fact
advice
the
title
has
in
fact
passed,
does
he
issue
or
may
he
issue
a
certificate
of
title.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it’s
our
position
that
that
is
clearly
so
by
the
single
judge
here
could
have.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
don’t
know
it
at
the
start
of
the
suit.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white
and
that’s
what
the
three-judge
court
did
in
putting
the
single
district
judge,
judge
rosen.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
do,
on
the
pleadings.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
in
which
upon
it
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
where
this
appeal
should
have
gone.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
in
this
court
was
a
direct
appeal
under
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
if
the
three
--
mr.
justice
douglas
if
this,
after
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court,
in
my
judgment
the
single
district
judge
could
have
entered
and
ordered
dismiss
on
the
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
because
it
was
moot.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
never
argue
that
before
the
single
judge
because
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
how
did
i
what?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
white’s
question
in
the
abstract
that
this
is
my
judgment
but
the
district
judge
couldn’t
as
of
his
own
have
dismissed
this
case
as
being
moot.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
without
any
argument
from
anyone.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
must
be,
that’s
one
point.
it
must
be
decided
by
three-judge
court
and
secondly
it
is
our
position
that
a
direct
appeal
from
this
court
under
the
three-judge
court
act
applies
--
does
not
apply
what
the
dismissal
is
on
procedural
grounds.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
my
position.
that
is
the
direct
position
we
are
argue
in
this
face.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
not
as
my
lawyer
the
opponent
argues
in
his
brief
taking
the
statute
literal.
the
statute
does
say
and
appeal
from
a
disposal
maybe
taken
directly
to
this
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
was
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that’s
right.
the
title
had
passed
so
that
no
relief
in
connection
of
that
car
could
be
obtained.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
damage
claim
is
not
a
three-judge
court
claim.
it
is
only
ancillary
to
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
complaint
was
filed
after
the
automobile
had
been
seized,
repossessed
after
it
had
been
sold
twice
so
that
the
car
could
not
be,
there
was
no
possibility
of
mr.
gonzalez
again
obtaining
his
automobile.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
was
in
the
plaintiffs’
pleading.
the
pleading
here
to
which
on
which
the
dismissal
was
made
was
the
plaintiffs’
pleading.
it
was
all
laid
out
in
the
complaint
as
i
have
stated
these
facts
to
you.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
and
notice
of
the
first
sale
have
been
given
to
mr.
gonzalez
as
required
by
statute.
so
he
knew
that
the
car
was
about
to
be
sold
to
someone
who
would
buy
it
as
a
bona
fide
purchaser,
acquired
actual
title
which
could
not
be
deface
right
here
or
anyone
else.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
filed
an
answer
to
the
complaint
and
then
moot
to
dismiss.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
allege
in
the
answer
these
facts
that
i
have
related
to
you
and
alleged
also
that
the
complaint
failed
the
state
the
cause
of
action
upon
which
any
relief
could
be
granted.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
because
of
mootness,
because
of
lack
of
standing.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
before
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
would
you
forgive
my
inattentiveness,
may
i
ask
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
i
should
say
this
that
the
three-judge
court
was
convened
before
i
was
retained
in
this
case
and
when
i
came
into
the
case
with
the
three-judge
court
already
in
existence
wishing
to
get
the
case
to
dismiss
because
what
i
thought
was
mootness
and
lack
of
standing
i
did
not
attack
the
three-judge
court
though
i
think
in
the
first
instance
that
i
have
been
entered
at
the
first
since
i
would
have
moot
the
district
judge
to
dismiss
the
case
for
mootness
and
lack
of
standing.
but
in
any
event,
the
three-judge
court
act
that
provides
court
of
appeals
for
this
court
on
dismissal
while
it
appears
on
its
face
to
enable
an
appealed
directly
to
this
court
on
any
dismissal
as
this
court
has
said
that
statute
is
to
be
strictly
construed
because
it’s
a
technical
statute
and
that
in
substance
what
that’s
appeal
provision
provides
is
that
if
the
decision
goes
to
the
issue
of
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
on
the
state
act.
then
of
course
it
comes
in
those
spirit
and
purpose
of
the
three-judge
court
act
and
of
the
appeal
provisions
of
that
act
and
a
direct
appeal
of
this
court
is
entirely
proper
but
where
the
case
is
dismissed
not
involving
the
merits
whatsoever
which
is
true
here.
then
under
your
honors
interpretation
of
that
the
phillips
case
and
others
cited
in
the
brief,
that
appeal
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
to
the
united
state
supreme
court
to
burden
this
court
with
appeals
involving
truly
procedural
matters.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
quite
agree
with
you,
i
don’t
know
what
the
status
of
the
repeal
of
the
three-judge
court.
that
sort
is
in
the
congress,
i
do
know
that
the
bar
very
much
favors
the
repeal
of
that
statute
and
i
was
hoping
like
the
court
could
have
acted
on
that
but
this
present
congress
but
i
don’t
know
whether
that’s
a
fact
or
not.
let’s
hope
it
will
in
the
american
lawyers
suit
(inaudible)
and
others
have
urged
american
bar
versus
on
the
repeal
on
that
three-judge
court
act.
now,
i
turn
to
mootness
inquiry
of
mr.
justice
marshall
and
others.
what’s
left
here?
the
automobile
has
been
repossessed
on
the
face
of
the
pleading
that
was
repossessed
in
violation
of
the
statute
which
authorizes
self-help
repossession
only
if
there
was
a
default.
notice
of
the
sale
was
given
to
mr.
gonzalez
he
took
no
action.
the
title
sale
was
held
and
title
passed
so
that
that
the
time
he
filed
his
suit
three
and
half
months
later
there
was
nothing
in
this
case
and
so
far
is
any
relief
could
be
granted
to
him.
he
couldn’t
get
his
automobile
back.
he
couldn’t
obtain
a
declaratory
judgment
because
the
declaratory
judgment
act
says
expressly
in
case
of
a
controversy.
you
may
apply
for
the
declaratory
judgment.
there's
not
controversy
here
between
mr.
gonzalez
and
anybody
else
because
he
can't
get
any
relief.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
the
settlement
issue
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
three-judge
court
decided
if
i
may
mr.
justice
white,
at
the
time
of
the
three-judge
court
entered
its
order
on
august
16,
1973
the
damage
claimed
called
for
still
viable
except
that
if
the
case
was
to
be
dismissed
on
other
ground
that
is
grounds
given
the
three-judge
court
act
viability,
then
the
damage
claim
would
fall
with
the
other
counts.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
really
if
i
could
sustain
that
position.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
certainly
do.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
do
more
certainly
urge
that
position.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
i
think
not
and
before
this,
there
was
state
action.
in
this
case
there
is
no
state
action.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
don’t
think
that
i
am
in
consistent
with
your
honors’
decision.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
of
course
your
honor.
your
honors’
opinion
and
the
court’s
opinion.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
there
is
this
difference
that
in
fuentes,
the
issues
viable
for
the
three-judge
court
remain
viable
but
here
that’s
not
so.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
because
before
the
suit
was
filed.
in
fuentes,
the
suit
was
–
the
litigation
commenced
very
quickly.
contemporaneously
with
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
replevin
in
each
of
those
two
cases.
but
here
when
this
suit
was
commenced
the
title
had
--
the
properly
had
been
repossessed,
had
been
sold
unnoticed
and
title
had
passed
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
but
no
settlement
of
the
damage
claim,
that
is
correct.
that
was
settled
on
december
28,
1973.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
oh!
here
we
have
one
as
in
burney
and
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
this
issue
was
not
to
be
decided
this
court
on
the
record
as
it
now
as
before
this
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes.
there
was
a
damage
claim
and
the
amount
of
the
damage
claim
was
out
of
way
determined
to
be
$750.00.
a
tender
was
made
of
the
$750.00.
that
damage
of
claim
was
a
subject
of
one
of
the
counts,
i’ve
forgotten
the
number.
that
count
was
solely
of
damages.
so
that
the
issue
of
damages
with
respect
to
the
alleged
tort
on
the
part
of
mercantile
in
the
seizing
by
so-called
the
automobile
when
there
was
no
default.
that
is
per
the
pleadings
there
was
no
default
and
the
district
--
the
three-judge
court
taking
the
matter
on
the
pleadings
rule
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
default
so
that
that
issue
is
out
because
that
was
settle
perhaps.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
that
didn’t
happen
at
the
end
of
that
particular
time
but
i
would
have
done
exactly
what
my
partners
did
and
that
is
because
at
that
particular
point
that
was
the
only
viable
issue
on
the
case
and
when
that
was
settled
there
was
no
longer
any
case
for
controversy
presented
here.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
justice
brennan
that
has
always
been
my
practice
in
44
years
but
if
i
can't
get
that
kind
of
agreement
i
get
the
best
i
can
get
and
that’s
really
what
the
answer
is
here.
may
it
please,
your
honors.
there
is
the
threshold
issue
of
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
at
all
which
i
will
discuss.
that
then
follows
whether
the
case
is
moot
for
which
i
will
also
discuss
and
also
whether
the
plaintiff
has
standing.
there
is
a
measure
of
confusion
with
respect
to
what
the
facts
are
here
and
cases
are
best
determined
on
the
facts
and
may
i
--
and
hopeful
be
helpful
to
the
court
and
review
just
for
a
minute
of
two
or
four
or
five
minutes
of
my
time
as
to
the
facts
in
the
case.
first,
this
isn’t
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
of
sections
503,
504
and
507
of
the
uniform
commercial
code.
as
this
court
knows,
the
illinois
uniform
commercial
code
is
the
most
pure
of
all
the
codes
in
the
49
states
and
in
the
virgin
islands,
and
especially
503,
504,
and
507
are
the
original
code.
this
is
article
ix
503,
504,
507
was
reexamined
by
the
american
law
institute
and
by
the
uniform
law
commissioners
in
1972
and
the
whole
chapter
was
rewritten.
so
that
you
have
presented
here
a
carefully
thought-out
and
considered
system
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
motor
vehicles
repossessions
and
effort
on
the
part
of
the
america
law
institute
and
the
commissioners
to
prepare
a
--
and
have
a
system
which
comports
as
near
as
maybe
and
sensibly
with
due
process.
now
this
503,
504,
and
507,
may
your
honors
please
is
before
you
on
applications
for
certiorari
in
several
cases
which
your
honors
have
deferred
presumably
awaiting
the
argument
of
this
particular
case.
so
that
the
merits
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
self-help
repossession
provisions
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
are
waiting
your
decision
as
whether
you
will
accept
on
certiorari
the
several,
i
think
there
are
four
maybe
five
that
are
now
pending
before
you
which
you
haven’t
acted
on.
the
important
here
is
the
fact
that
that
issue
was
not
determined
by
the
district
court
or
the
three-judge
court
here
at
all.
the
merits
are
unconstitutionality
if
have
been
unconstitutional
of
503,
504,
and
507
is
not
before
the
court.
the
dismissal
here
was
on
currently
procedural
grounds.
now,
mr.
gonzalez
purchased
this
pontiac
used
car
on
the
22nd
of
january
1972.
he
made
a
downpayment
and
then
he
was
to
pay
15
monthly
installments
thereafter
of
a
$120.74
commencing
on
the
28th
of
february
of
the
following
month.
he
paid
that
first
installment.
he
paid
none
other
to
this
day
at
any
time.
now,
the
contract
provided
consistent
with
sections
503,
504,
and
507
that
on
default,
the
creditor
was
entitled
to
re
--
make
repossession
with
or
without
traditional
process
the
contract
expressly
so
provide.
sections
503
and
504
as
has
been
said
on
all
of
the
cases
there
are
now
pending
before
you
on
certiorari.
a
pure
codification
of
the
old
common
law
that
you
may
enter
into
a
contract
of
self-help
possession
upon
a
proper
default,
this
contract
was
assigned
to
mercantile
by
the
used
car
dealer.
now,
mr.
gonzalez
was
involved
into
automobile
accidents
one
on
march
26,
1972,
one
on
april
16
1972
resulting
in
repairs
that
had
to
be
paid
of
$542.68.
the
insurance
company
only
paid
$322.00.
on
april
18th,
the
insurance
company
in
the
face
of
two
accidents
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
wouldn’t
want
the
members
of
this
court
think
that
i
was
having
the
client
pay
money
to
settle
a
particular
claim
without
some
good
reason.
on
the
16th
of
august
1973,
the
district
court
three-judge
court
entered
and
order
dismissing
the
entire
case
as
moot.
that
decision
was
correct
as
i
will,
i
think
successfully
argue.
there
remain
however
the
damage
claim
count
four
and
while
since
the
issues
involving
constitutionality
and
the
injunction
under
the
conjunction
act
were
moot
and
the
damage
claim
would
then
draw
up
also
i
was
concern
that
that
particular
matter
still
remain
at
large
and
that
this
was
in
the
nature
that
we
knew
with
my
distinguished
and
able,
dedicated
opponent
had
in
mind
making
this
a
test
case,
that
the
record
should
be
made
clean.
since
he
would
not
agree
to
dismiss
the
whole
case
and
the
payment
of
the
$750.00,
we
just
want
to
have
and
paid
it
and
that
at
least
dropped
that
one
possible
viable
claim
and
that
was
the
reasons.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
it
did.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
alleged
wrongful
taking.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
oh!
the
burney
case,
yes
and
i
have
tend
to
advert
to
that
if
i
may
in
a
moment
or
two.
may
i
also
say
if
your
honors
please,
i
did
mention
that
the
constitutional
issue
is
not
involved
here.
as
the
case
was
dismissed
for
mootness,
i
did
advert
to
the
fact
that
there
are
several
petitions
for
certiorari
pending
before
this
court.
in
that
connection,
there
are
eight
decisions
of
courts
of
appeal
in
this
nation
and
all
of
which
sections
503,
504,
507
were
sustained
--
have
been
sustained
us
to
constitutionality.
those
eight
cases
are
in
sixth
courts
of
appeals,
the
ninth,
eighth,
the
fifth,
the
third,
the
sixth
and
the
second.
five
of
those
eight
cases
are
pending
on
certiorari
in
this
court.
in
the
first
of
those
cases
that
is
adams
versus
southern
california
first
national
bank.
the
permanent
editorial
board
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
consisting
as
you
know
of
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i'm
not
going
to
argue
about
the
three-judge
court
because
we
did
not
go
over
nor
did
we
contend
that
the
three-judge
court
was
improperly
convened.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
and
may
i
turn
directly
to
that
point?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
finishing
if
i
may
mr.
justice
white
of
the
facts
so
we’ll
have
the
perspective.
the
insurance
company
cancelled
the
insurance
on
the
18th
of
april
with
respect
to
the
two
accidents
one
occurring
on
march
and
one
occurring
in
april,
and
rebated
$229.94
of
the
unearned
premium.
the
repairs
were
$542.68.
mercantile
repossessed
the
repaired
automobile
on
the
25th
of
april
and
paid
the
repairmen
at
that
particular
time,
his
repair
bill
of
$542.00
so
was
required
taking
of
possession.
now,
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
since
the
case
was
disposed
of
on
the
pleadings.
it
is
alleged
on
the
complaint
that
mr.
gonzalez
was
not
in
default
at
the
time
of
the
repossession.
if
you
take
the
figures,
it
would
appear
that
probably
not
so,
that
he
was
in
fact
in
default
but
for
the
disposition
of
this
case
the
case
was
taken
on
the
plea
and
so
it
is
presumed
on
the
plaintiffs.
there’ve
been
no
proof
taken
on
this
case
at
whatsoever
that
at
the
time
of
the
repossession
mr.
gonzalez
was
not
on
default
so
as
a
--
on
the
pleadings
it
was
a
wrongful
taking.
so
it
was
a
breach
of
503
and
504
because
503
and
504
permits
self-help
only
if
there
is
a
default
under
the
contract.
the
mercantile
having
repossessed
under
the
illinois
statutes
dealing
with
issuances
of
certificate
of
title
which
do
not
affect
--
those
certificates
do
not
in
fact
affect
actual
title
and
the
statute
so
provides.
the
certificate
of
title
is
issued
for
the
purpose
of
recording
for
keeping
track
of
the
car
from
a
police
standpoint
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
driver’s
license
and
that
kind
of
made.
it’s
a
ministerial
act.
a
repossession
license
was
issued
under
the
illinois
statute
here
again
not
affecting
actual
title.
now,
notice
of
the
sale
of
the
automobile
use
repaired
used
car
was
given
to
mr.
gonzalez
by
registered
man.
he
did
not
act,
took
no
action
whatsoever
and
the
automobile
is
then
sold
to
a
bona
fide
purchaser
and
that
bona
fide
purchaser
acquire
actual
title,
as
provided
under
the
statute
and
also
under
the
common
law.
that
purchase
in
turn
sold
to
a
second
party.
now,
whether
the
automobile
will
be
sold
again,
we
don’t
know
but
at
least
we
know
of
those
two
sales
that
are
all
alleged
in
the
pleadings.
now,
after
all
this
had
occurred
--
after
all
of
this
had
occurred
mr.
gonzalez
then
intervene
in
a
pending
suit,
the
mojica
suit
which
is
not
involve
here
and
for
the
first
time
on
september
28,
1972
after
all
these
months
that
time
had
passed
he
filed
the
intervening
complaint
which
is
a
subject
matter
before
your
honors
on
this
particular
case.
so
at
that
particular
time,
the
title
of
the
car
could
not
be
reclaimed
in
any
form
or
fashion
or
otherwise.
no
relief
sought
the
three-judge
district
court
unless
we
urge
it,
no
relief
whatsoever
could
be
granted
to
mr.
gonzalez
at
the
time
he
filed
his
suit
that
would
be
of
any
possible
benefit
to
it.
now,
to
a
dedicated
and
able
young
lawyer
as
mr.
latturner
is
with
the
legal
services
group
in
uptown
chicago,
it
appeared
to
him
that
here
was
a
case
in
which
issue,
broad
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
re.
self-help
repossession
provisions
could
be
obtained.
and
so
he
filed
the
claim
with
that
particular
time.
now,
the
district
court
three-judge
dismissed
this
case
because
of
mootness
and
lack
of
standing
and
that’s
the
first
point
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mootness
and
standing,
both
dismissed
because
of
mootness
and
lack
of
standing.
having
done
that,
it
is
the
position
-
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
lack
of
a
case
or
controversy
--
lack
of
a
case
or
controversy,
mootness
and
lack
of
standing
in
the
sense
of
the
absence
of
the
right
of
the
plaintiff
to
maintain
the
suit
in
his
own
name
and
the
suit
on
behalf
of
the
alleged
class.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
direct
appeal
under
the
three-judge
act
to
this
court
forcing
this
court
to
accept
the
case
or
on
examination
of
the
jurisdictional
service.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
because
under
--
one
of
the
counts
of
the
complaint,
the
secretary
of
state
of
illinois
was
made
a
party
defendant
as
purely
nominal
party
as
you
will
notice
the
attorney
general
lawyer
is
not
before
this
court
and
the
secretary
of
state
is
not
before
this
court.
they
just
ignored
the
case.
having
the
secretary
of
state
as
a
party
defendant,
we
say
nominally
it
is
the
position
of
counsel
for
mr.
gonzalez
that
that
involve
state
action
to
bring
the
case
within
the
injunction
provisions.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no
i
don’t,
i
mean
that
his
function
here
is
so
peripheral
that
is
issuing
a
certificate
of
title.
that
is
it
is
ministerial
act
of
issuing
the
certificate
of
title
when
advice
following
a
sale
or
repossession
that
the
automobile
has
sold
--
been
sold
are
now
is
in
the
good
title
in
someone
else
and
the
statute
defines
it
expressly
that
only
when
the
secretary
of
state
is
in
fact
advice
the
title
has
in
fact
passed,
does
he
issue
or
may
he
issue
a
certificate
of
title.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it’s
our
position
that
that
is
clearly
so
by
the
single
judge
here
could
have.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
don’t
know
it
at
the
start
of
the
suit.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white
and
that’s
what
the
three-judge
court
did
in
putting
the
single
district
judge,
judge
rosen.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
do,
on
the
pleadings.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
in
which
upon
it
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
is
where
this
appeal
should
have
gone.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
in
this
court
was
a
direct
appeal
under
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
if
the
three
--
mr.
justice
douglas
if
this,
after
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court,
in
my
judgment
the
single
district
judge
could
have
entered
and
ordered
dismiss
on
the
case.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
because
it
was
moot.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
never
argue
that
before
the
single
judge
because
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
how
did
i
what?
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
white’s
question
in
the
abstract
that
this
is
my
judgment
but
the
district
judge
couldn’t
as
of
his
own
have
dismissed
this
case
as
being
moot.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
without
any
argument
from
anyone.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
must
be,
that’s
one
point.
it
must
be
decided
by
three-judge
court
and
secondly
it
is
our
position
that
a
direct
appeal
from
this
court
under
the
three-judge
court
act
applies
--
does
not
apply
what
the
dismissal
is
on
procedural
grounds.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
my
position.
that
is
the
direct
position
we
are
argue
in
this
face.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
not
as
my
lawyer
the
opponent
argues
in
his
brief
taking
the
statute
literal.
the
statute
does
say
and
appeal
from
a
disposal
maybe
taken
directly
to
this
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
it
was
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that’s
right.
the
title
had
passed
so
that
no
relief
in
connection
of
that
car
could
be
obtained.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
the
damage
claim
is
not
a
three-judge
court
claim.
it
is
only
ancillary
to
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
complaint
was
filed
after
the
automobile
had
been
seized,
repossessed
after
it
had
been
sold
twice
so
that
the
car
could
not
be,
there
was
no
possibility
of
mr.
gonzalez
again
obtaining
his
automobile.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
was
in
the
plaintiffs’
pleading.
the
pleading
here
to
which
on
which
the
dismissal
was
made
was
the
plaintiffs’
pleading.
it
was
all
laid
out
in
the
complaint
as
i
have
stated
these
facts
to
you.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
and
notice
of
the
first
sale
have
been
given
to
mr.
gonzalez
as
required
by
statute.
so
he
knew
that
the
car
was
about
to
be
sold
to
someone
who
would
buy
it
as
a
bona
fide
purchaser,
acquired
actual
title
which
could
not
be
deface
right
here
or
anyone
else.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
filed
an
answer
to
the
complaint
and
then
moot
to
dismiss.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
we
allege
in
the
answer
these
facts
that
i
have
related
to
you
and
alleged
also
that
the
complaint
failed
the
state
the
cause
of
action
upon
which
any
relief
could
be
granted.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
because
of
mootness,
because
of
lack
of
standing.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
before
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
would
you
forgive
my
inattentiveness,
may
i
ask
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
i
should
say
this
that
the
three-judge
court
was
convened
before
i
was
retained
in
this
case
and
when
i
came
into
the
case
with
the
three-judge
court
already
in
existence
wishing
to
get
the
case
to
dismiss
because
what
i
thought
was
mootness
and
lack
of
standing
i
did
not
attack
the
three-judge
court
though
i
think
in
the
first
instance
that
i
have
been
entered
at
the
first
since
i
would
have
moot
the
district
judge
to
dismiss
the
case
for
mootness
and
lack
of
standing.
but
in
any
event,
the
three-judge
court
act
that
provides
court
of
appeals
for
this
court
on
dismissal
while
it
appears
on
its
face
to
enable
an
appealed
directly
to
this
court
on
any
dismissal
as
this
court
has
said
that
statute
is
to
be
strictly
construed
because
it’s
a
technical
statute
and
that
in
substance
what
that’s
appeal
provision
provides
is
that
if
the
decision
goes
to
the
issue
of
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
on
the
state
act.
then
of
course
it
comes
in
those
spirit
and
purpose
of
the
three-judge
court
act
and
of
the
appeal
provisions
of
that
act
and
a
direct
appeal
of
this
court
is
entirely
proper
but
where
the
case
is
dismissed
not
involving
the
merits
whatsoever
which
is
true
here.
then
under
your
honors
interpretation
of
that
the
phillips
case
and
others
cited
in
the
brief,
that
appeal
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
not
to
the
united
state
supreme
court
to
burden
this
court
with
appeals
involving
truly
procedural
matters.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
quite
agree
with
you,
i
don’t
know
what
the
status
of
the
repeal
of
the
three-judge
court.
that
sort
is
in
the
congress,
i
do
know
that
the
bar
very
much
favors
the
repeal
of
that
statute
and
i
was
hoping
like
the
court
could
have
acted
on
that
but
this
present
congress
but
i
don’t
know
whether
that’s
a
fact
or
not.
let’s
hope
it
will
in
the
american
lawyers
suit
(inaudible)
and
others
have
urged
american
bar
versus
on
the
repeal
on
that
three-judge
court
act.
now,
i
turn
to
mootness
inquiry
of
mr.
justice
marshall
and
others.
what’s
left
here?
the
automobile
has
been
repossessed
on
the
face
of
the
pleading
that
was
repossessed
in
violation
of
the
statute
which
authorizes
self-help
repossession
only
if
there
was
a
default.
notice
of
the
sale
was
given
to
mr.
gonzalez
he
took
no
action.
the
title
sale
was
held
and
title
passed
so
that
that
the
time
he
filed
his
suit
three
and
half
months
later
there
was
nothing
in
this
case
and
so
far
is
any
relief
could
be
granted
to
him.
he
couldn’t
get
his
automobile
back.
he
couldn’t
obtain
a
declaratory
judgment
because
the
declaratory
judgment
act
says
expressly
in
case
of
a
controversy.
you
may
apply
for
the
declaratory
judgment.
there's
not
controversy
here
between
mr.
gonzalez
and
anybody
else
because
he
can't
get
any
relief.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
the
settlement
issue
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
three-judge
court
decided
if
i
may
mr.
justice
white,
at
the
time
of
the
three-judge
court
entered
its
order
on
august
16,
1973
the
damage
claimed
called
for
still
viable
except
that
if
the
case
was
to
be
dismissed
on
other
ground
that
is
grounds
given
the
three-judge
court
act
viability,
then
the
damage
claim
would
fall
with
the
other
counts.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
really
if
i
could
sustain
that
position.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
certainly
do.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
do
more
certainly
urge
that
position.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
no,
i
think
not
and
before
this,
there
was
state
action.
in
this
case
there
is
no
state
action.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
i
don’t
think
that
i
am
in
consistent
with
your
honors’
decision.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
yes
of
course
your
honor.
your
honors’
opinion
and
the
court’s
opinion.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
there
is
this
difference
that
in
fuentes,
the
issues
viable
for
the
three-judge
court
remain
viable
but
here
that’s
not
so.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
well,
because
before
the
suit
was
filed.
in
fuentes,
the
suit
was
–
the
litigation
commenced
very
quickly.
contemporaneously
with
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
replevin
in
each
of
those
two
cases.
but
here
when
this
suit
was
commenced
the
title
had
--
the
properly
had
been
repossessed,
had
been
sold
unnoticed
and
title
had
passed
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
but
no
settlement
of
the
damage
claim,
that
is
correct.
that
was
settled
on
december
28,
1973.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
oh!
here
we
have
one
as
in
burney
and
--
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
this
issue
was
not
to
be
decided
this
court
on
the
record
as
it
now
as
before
this
court.
mr.
albert
e.
jenner,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
thank
you.
