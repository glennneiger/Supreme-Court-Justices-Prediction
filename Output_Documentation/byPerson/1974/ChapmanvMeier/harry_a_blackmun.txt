justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
this
all
you
are
complaining
about,
senatorial
districts?
you
had
a
tradition,
haven't
you,
of
multimember
house
districts
at
all
times?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
all
i
am
saying
is,
that
your
concern
is
on
the
senate
side,
and
you
have
always
had
on
a
house
side
a
multimember
districts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
kelly,
this
maybe
an
unfair
question.
what's
your
guess
as
to
what
if
anything
the
legislature
will
do
come
the
turn
of
the
year,
are
they
meeting
in
january?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
any
serious
attempt
to
talk
about
reapportionment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
sand
let
me
get
straightened
out.
prior
to
1965
were
your
house
districts
single-member
districts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
that
the
two
to
one
isn't
a
very
long
tradition
at
all,
it's
only
a
decade?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
its
a
court
imposed
tradition
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
you
have
any
--
you
say
one
to
five
before
1965,
did
you
have
many
multimember
house
districts?
probably
far
fewer
than
you
had
single-member
districts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
large
in
the
larger
cities?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
a
reapportionment
of
the
north
dakota
legislature.
the
somewhat
unusual
features
of
the
reapportionment
was
ordered
by
a
federal
court
and
is
not
one
affected
by
the
legislature
itself.
for
a
decade
now,
north
dakota
has
struggled
with
reapportionment.
there
has
been
constant
litigation
in
that
state
challenging
various
plans
and
statutes
and
provisions
of
the
state's
constitution.
in
1965,
a
three-judge
federal
court
approved
the
reapportionment
plan
that
for
the
first
time
included
five
multimember
senatorial
districts.
the
present
action
was
instituted
after
the
1970
census.
the
appellants
alleged
that
substantial
population
shifts
had
occurred
and
that
the
1965
plan
no
longer
met
the
requirements
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
a
three-judge
court
held
that
the
1965
plan
failed
now
to
meet
constitutional
standards
and
by
a
divided
vote
it
approved
a
new
plan
that
called
for
a
continuing
multimember
senatorial
districts
and
that
contained
a
population
variance
of
approximately
20%.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
when
a
federal
district
court
orders
state
legislative
reapportionment,
it
should
refrain
in
the
absence
of
persuasive
contrary
justifications
from
imposing
multimember
districts
upon
a
state.
we
also
hold
that
a
population
variance
of
such
magnitude
as
20%
is
impermissible
in
a
court
ordered
plan
in
the
absence
of
significant
state
policies
or
other
acceptable
considerations
that
require
the
plan's
adoption.
the
burden
is
on
the
court
to
elucidate
the
reasons
--
necessitate
any
departure
from
the
goal
of
population
equality
and
to
articulate
the
relationship
between
the
variance
and
the
state
policy
furthered.
we
conclude
that
the
allowance
of
the
variance
here
was
not
appropriately
justified.
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
