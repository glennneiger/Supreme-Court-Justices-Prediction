chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
73-1406,
chapman
and
others
against
meier.
mr.
kelly
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
let
me
make
sure
i
have
one
thing
clear
here
in
what
differences
may
derive
from
it.
you
are
asking
us
to
review
not
a
plan
enacted
by
the
legislature
of
the
state,
but
to
review
a
plan
mandated
some
five,
six,
seven
years
ago
by
a
federal
district
court,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
a
judgment
of
a
court
not
of
state
legislature?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
largest
number
of
senators
in
anyone
district
in
the
states?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
illustration
that
you
are
using
the
people,
the
voters
had
to
make
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
have
formed
on
15
different
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
30
but
they
had
the
right
to
perform
on
15
they
were
going
to
vote
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
of
these
judges
is
from
the
state
of
north
dakota?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kelly
you
think
there
are
--
apparently
think
there
is
no
difference
our
reviewing
or
being
asked
to
review
the
action
of
the
state
legislature
on
the
reapportionment
and
the
action
of
the
district
court
on
reapportionment
independent
of
any
legislative
enactment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
anyways,
right
now
i
am
asking
what
you
think
the
difference
is
or
whether
you
think
there
is
no
difference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
are
you
suggesting
that
your
friends
who
will
argue
on
opposition
to
you
is
not
speaking
for
the
state
of
north
dakota
through
it's
secretary
of
state?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
he
is
speaking
for
him
as
an
individual
or
as
a
state
officer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
just
being
here
for
the
state,
you
have
me
lost
a
little
bit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
maybe
one
speculation
is
reasonable
as
that
or
as
reasonable
as
any
other
is,
that
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
attorney
general
merely
want
to
let
this
plan
stay
in
effect
until
the
legislature
can
come
to
grips
with
it
in
a
few
months
from
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
your
mr.
kelly.
mr.
sand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
attorney
general,
you
have
just
mentioned
again
the
20%
variance.
i
don't
recall
whether
in
any
opinions
of
the
court,
we
have
ever
distinguished
between
--
in
percentages
between
large
area
like
new
york
and
california
and
a
smaller
state
like
north
dakota,
but
if
my
arithmetic
is
correct
and
i
don't
vouch
for
it,
the
variation
per
senator,
elected
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
is
only
786
votes.
786
voters;
that
is
11,775
in
the
29th
district
to
12,561
in
the
18th
district,
that's
on
page
3
of
your
brief.
now,
having
said
that
and
if
my
arithmetic
is
correct,
which
i
am
not
sure
it
is,
do
you
think
the
court
ought
to
have
â€“
ought
to
exert
much
bigger
flexibility
dealing
with
a
small
number
of
voters
than
with
a
percentage
that
would
make
a
variation
of
hundreds
and
thousands?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
it
cuts
both
ways?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
kelly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
6
and
7
of
the
jurisdictional
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
you
allocate
that
percentage,
you
get
a
slightly
different
figure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
73-1406,
chapman
against
meier
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
