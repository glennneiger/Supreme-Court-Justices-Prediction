mr.
john
d.
kelly
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
north
dakota,
which
established
a
permanent
apportionment
plan,
that
is
permanent
for
1970s,
based
on
the
1970
decennial
census.
the
judgment
involves
a
plan
that
establishes
five
large
multimember
districts
involving
both
houses
of
the
north
dakota
legislature
and
involves
a
--
in
terms
of
population
variances
in
excessive
20%
and
in
overall
average,
i
think
in
plus
and
minus
5%
or
an
average
of
10%
variance.
the
issues
that
we
present,
first
of
all,
involve
the
issue
of
whether
a
court
in
fashioning
a
plan
and
absent
any
contrary
state
policy
which
support
the
establishment
of
multimember
districts
or
unusual
or
unique
circumstances,
could
deny
the
appellants
the
equitable
remedy
of
single
member
districting.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice
except
that
the
plan
that
we
are
asking
for
a
review
of
today
is
a
plan
that
was
established
as
a
permanent
plan
by
a
judgment
that
was
entered
in
january
of
1974.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
this
is
not
a
review
of
a
plan
that
has
been
adopted
by
the
north
dakota
legislature.
the
facts
basically
are
that
following
the
1970
census,
the
legislative
assembly
in
north
dakota
failed
to
adopt
a
plan.
we
started
this
lawsuit
in
federal
court,
asking
for
a
reapportionment,
based
on
the
substantial
changes
in
population
within
in
the
state
of
north
dakota,
basically
a
shift
from
rural
to
urban
areas,
under
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
then
we
are
also
in
that
case
requested
pursuant
to
connor
v.
johnson,
the
application
of
the
equitable
remedy
of
single-member
districts.
in
north
dakota,
the
tradition
was
from
statehood
until
the
mid
1960s
a
tradition
based
on
a
constitutional
provision,
specifically
section
29,
that
senatorial
districts
where
to
be
represented
by
one
senator
and
no
more.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
we
have
had
a
tradition
that
is
basically
been
one
senator
and
two
house
district
members.
now
the
constitution,
until
these
provisions
were
voided
by
decisions
of
the
federal
court
in
the
mid
1960s,
did
provide,
had
a
restriction
on
the
establishment
of
senate
districts
in
that
you
couldn't
break
up
a
county
attached
part
of
one
county
to
another
county
to
form
a
senate
district.
you
could
take
two,
two
counties
and
make
one
district,
but
you
couldn't
breakup
a
county.
you
could
also
breakup
county
as
long
as
no
part
of
the
county
was
attached
to
another.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
our
concern
is
on
the
--
basically
on
the
senate
side.
we
concede
based
on
the
traditions
of
north
dakota
that
it
is
not
required.
we
asked
originally
for
a
single-member
districts
for
both
houses,
but
there
is
a
tradition
of
one
senator
district.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
there
was
a
constitutional
amendment
that
was
defeated
which
established
basically
a
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
well,
no
the
basic
thrust
of
the
amendment
was
not
to
establish
single
districts,
it
was
to
establish
a
constitutional
apportionment
commission
and
it
was
presented
to
the
people
of
north
dakota
as
this
was
a
--
going
to
provide
a
way
of
apportioning
the
state
legislature
taking
this
power
from
the
state
legislature.
and
the
attorney
general
who
was
responsible
for
with
the
secretory
state
for
specifying
what
this
constitutional
amendment
provided,
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
amendment.
now,
the
amendment
also
covered
the
establishment
of
single-member
districts
for
both
houses
of
the
legislature,
but
insofar
as
the
people
of
north
dakota
knew,
it
was
only
after
the
election
that
they
were
ever
advised
that
they
just
rejected
the
concept
of
single-member
districting.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
he
was
one
of
three
members
of
the
commission
that
was
appointed
by
the
court.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
it's
just
mr.
dobson
plan.
there
were
other
plans
and
mr.
dobson's
plan
was
first
adopted
by
an
order
of
the
district
court
in
june
of
1972
as
an
interim
plan
because
they
had,
they
reached
the
determination
that
the
then
existing
apportionment
plan
was
invalid
under
the
equal
protection
clause
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
well,
there
were
some
reservations,
majority
of
the
court
at
that
time
said
well
we
recognize
some
deficiencies,
the
substantial
population
variances,
the
fact
that
the
plan
does
not
provide
for
single
member
senate
districts.
but
they
were
faced
with
being
in
a
time
situation
and
much
like
the
situation
was
in
i
think
in
virginia
under
the
mahan
v.
howell
case
where
they
were
really
faced
with,
and
this
is
what
was
adopted
as
a
interim
plan
originally.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
the
reconstitute
majority
of
the
district
court
adopted
it
as
a
permanent
plan.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
well,
originally
two
members
of
the
three-member
court,
judge
van
sickle
decided
that
adopted
it
only
as
an
interim
plan,
saying
after
the
1972
elections
the
special
masters
were
referred
on
a
permanent
plan.
they
expressed
substantial
interest
in
what
was
called
the
ostenson
plan
which
was
another
plan
that
had
been
proposed
by
one
of
the
special
masters.
but
then
after
the
elections,
there
were
some
delays
for
the
elections,
that
one
of
which
mr.
justice
douglas
referred
to.
i
might
point
out
that
at
that
election
where
the
proposed
constitutional
amendments
were
rejected
by
the
core
of
the
people,
the
people
also
rejected
a
legislative
plan
that
had
been
passed
by
the
north
dakota
legislative
assembly
which
provided
for
multimember
districts
much
like
the
dobson
plan
and
that
was
voted
down.
so,
i
don't
think
that
you
can
work
to
the
election
results
in
north
dakota,
the
special
elections
that
were
conducted
in
december
of
1973
and
say
this
establishes
a
state
policy
in
favor
of
multimember
districts
are
really
in
opposition
because
the
people
voted
no
on
both
issues.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
we're
not
asking
for
that
all
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
what
we
are
asking
for
is,
on
this
issue,
is
a
reversal
with
corrections
to
follow
the
supervisory
directive
that
this
court
gave
in
--
first
in
connor
v.
johnson
and
has
reiterated
that
when
a
court
is
called
upon
to
fashion
a
reapportionment
plan
in
the
absence
of
some
contrary
state
policy
or
specially
in
unique
circumstances
that
you
should
do
so
on
the
basis
of
single-member
districts.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
right,
it
is
not
--
we're
not
submitting
this
issue
on
the
basis
that
it
is
a
constitutional
requirement,
but
it
is
the
general
rule.
now
in
the
whitcomb
case
from
indiana
there
was
an
exception
recognized
based
on
a
indiana
constitutional
provision
that
said
you're
not
going
to
break
up
counties
to
establish
senate
districts
and
as
i
understand
the
whitcomb
case,
there
was
a
recognition
that
the
general
rule
which
is
an
equitable
remedy,
had
to
give
way
in
view
of
this
legitimate
state
policy.
but
in
north
dakota
we
don't
have
any,
either
a
constitutional
or
a
statutory
policy
that
would
favor
multimember
districts.
the
second
exception
which
i
think
the
court
recognized
in
the
virginia
case
was
that
unique
or
unusual
circumstances
can
justify
multimember
districts
in
a
court
fashioned
plan.
and
in
this
case
we're
not
saying
that
there
maybe
unique
circumstances
that
will
require
some
type
of
multimember
districts
to
handle
the
situation
which
is
really
quite
equivalent
to
that
involved
in
the
virginia
case.
we
have
got
substantial
military
personal
at
the
grand
forks
air
force
base
and
at
minot
air
force
base
and
if
in
fact
based
on
an
analysis
which
dakota
called
upon
the
masters
to
make
about
how
to
proposals
or
as
to
how
to
handle
a
military
personal.
if
in
fact
that
unique
situation
would
justify
an
adoption
of
a
plan
that
would
provide
for
some
type
multimember
districting
to
handle
the
military
personal
at
the
two
bases
then
that's
fine,
we're
not
going
to
--
we're
not
arguing
with
that.
but
what
we
were
saying
is,
is
that
absent
a
state
policy
and
absent
special
or
unique
circumstances,
this
court
should
enforce
the
rule
that
it
established
not
as
a
constitutional
matter,
but
as
a
matter
of
superintending
direction
over
the
district
courts
and
the
inferior
courts
to
give
us
what
is
the
equitable
remedy
of
the
single-member
districting.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
i
think
not.
the
governor
vetoed
it
and
it
was
passed
over
his
veto
and
the
people
voted
it
down
and
i
would
think
under
those
circumstances,
that
since
the
legislature
is
just
the
representative
of
the
people,
that
and
in
north
dakota,
we
have
the
right
to
refer
measures,
the
people
have
the
right
to
refer
measures
that
they
are
not
satisfied
with,
that
the
legislature
passed,
that
legislation
was
referred
and
it
was
defeated.
and
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
be
unsound
to
draw
an
inference
at
this
somehow
represents
a
support
as
far
as
state
policy
goes
for
multimember
districts.
i
would
think
it
quite
to
the
contrary.
it
shows
reluctance
by
the
people
of
north
dakota
to
accept
a
program
in
a
situation
that
was
not
established
in
the
first
instance
by
the
people
of
north
dakota
or
the
politicians.
we
never
had
this
kind
of
districting
in
north
dakota
until
the
mid
1960s
at
which
time
the
court
established
large
multimember
districts
and
in
doing
so
they
said
well
if
there
is
any
problem,
the
legislature
can
handle
it.
well
the
legislature
is
been
handling
it
and
struggling
with
it
for
10
years
and
they
have
never
been
able
to
resolve
it
because
obviously
the
effect
of
this
kind
of
districting
is
that
one
party
tends
to
win
all
the
seats,
and
8
days
ago
there
was
somewhat
of
a
changed
situation
and
in
terms
of
larger
multimember
districts,
five
senators
from
the
one
party
were
all
lost
to
the
other
party.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
terms
of
political
fairness,
and
we're
not
talking
about
political
fairness
basically
to
the
parties,
but
to
the
people.
you're
talking
about
a
situation
where
people
are
required
to
select
15
out
of
30
candidates.
well
a
conscious
voter
is
really
close
to
being
rendered
a
basket
case
if
he
really
is
serious
about
trying
to
find
out
what
individual
qualifications
are.
and
these
i
think
were
the
factors
that
this
court
recognized
back
in
as
early
as
1964
in
the
colorado
assembly
case
where
you
enumerated
defects
in
multimember
districts,
but
saying
you
were
not
prepared
to
rule
if
they
were
unconstitutional
per
se.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
there
were
five
senators.
the
21st
district
consists
of
--
it's
setup
for
five
senators
and
ten
representatives,
so
we
are
electing
in
a
large
--
in
a
party
elections
thirty
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
that's
right,
there
are
two
other
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
30
different
people
if
they
are
going
to
have
a
kind
of
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
right.
in
two
of
the
other
districts
involved,
four
senators
and
eight
representatives
so
it's
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
they
are
meeting
in
january.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
mr.
justice
blackmun,
this
is
not
a
veto-proof
legislature
this
time
and
there
is
an
executive
branch
and
the
majority
party
in
the
legislature
are
opposite
sides
of
the
fence.
and
when
i
say
that
this
is
a
dilemma
or
struggle
that
has
been
going
on
for
10
years,
it
is
not
going
to
be
resolved
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
legislative
assembly
for
the
reasons
that
it
hasn't
been
resolved
since
this
type
of
districting
was
first
established
back
in
1965
because
the
governor
vetoes
the
multimember
legislation
and
this
time
as
distinguished
from
last
time
where
they
had
to
take
it
to
the
vote
of
the
people,
they
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
override
this
veto
this
time.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
i
think
that
that's
the
reason
that
history
has
not
borne
out
the
observation
by,
i
think
judge
vogel
in
1965
case
when
he
established
multimember
districting,
that
if
there
was
a
problem,
the
legislature
would
take
care
of
it.
well,
the
legislature
has
vested
,
really
quite
a
vested
interest
in
maintaining
this
type
of
districting.
and
we're
really
faced
with
a
situation
where
the
constitutional
provisions
that
really
provide
the
state
legislature
with
authority
to
reapportion
have
been
declared
invalid.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
there
is
also
a
substantial
question
as
to
whether
the
legislature
really
has
the
authority
to
reapportion
itself.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
they
stem
from
--
right,
from
changing
the
traditions
of
our
state
and
imposing
this
kind
of
legislative
districting.
now
the
reconstituted
majority
in
this
case
said
that,
they
justified
the
continuation
of
the
multimember
districting
on
the
basis
that
it
wasn't
--
as
a
constitutional
matter
they
were
required
to
break
up
these
large
districts.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
well,
judge
benson
originally
wanted
to
just
adopt
the
dobson
plan
permanently,
that
was
back
in
1972.
judge
bright
and
judge
van
sickle
said
just
for
the
72
elections,
the
decision
--
on
january
30,
1974,
judge
benson
and
judge
van
sickle
made
up
the
majority
and
judge
bright
wrote
a
dissent.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
all
three
judges
reside
in
north
dakota.
judge
bright
is
of
course
on
the
circuit
court
of
appeal.
so
they
all
reside
in
north
dakota.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
insofar
as
we're
complaining
if
it
means
that
we're
going
to
have
a
district,
a
house
district
with
10
members,
but
we're
willing
to
concede
that
in
accordance
with
the
traditions
of
north
dakota
that
a
district
that
would
be
comprised
of
one
senator
and
two
house
members
which
is
what
the
original
decision
of
judge
benson
or
judge
bright
and
judge
van
sickle
was
back
in
1972,
we're
willing
to
accept
that
because
that
is
not
a
large
multimember
district
and
it
is
historically
in
accordance
with
our
traditions
and
it
would
seem
to
me
not
confronts
the
people
of
north
dakota
with
the
type
of
problems
that
they
are
involved
with
now
in
terms
of
large
districts,
involving
large
numbers
of
people
so
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
that's
our
position.
we
had
originally
asked
for
single
member
districting
across
the
board,
but
on
reflection,
considering
the
traditions
of
north
dakota
in
terms
of
single
senator
districts
with
two-member
representation
from
the
house,
we
felt
that,
that
would
be
more
appropriate
and
that
was
all
that
the
district
court
was
prepared
to
give
us
and
we
at
that
time
thought
that
really
met
with
the
compliance
with
this
court's
rule
in
connor
v.
johnson
about
avoiding
large
multimember
districts
as
the
general
rule.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
this
is
a
--
we're
talking
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
now
--
i
think
that
this
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
well,
i
think
that
if
you
are
called
upon
to
review
a
state
plan
that
is
adopted
by
a
state
legislative
body
and
that
plan
has
multimember
districting,
that
in
the
absence
of
some
showing
that
this
was
discriminatory
or
objectionable
on
constitutional
grounds
that
you'd
have
to
say
them
that,
that
is
a
state
policy
which
we
will
respect,
if
it's
not
attacked
on
constitutional
grounds.
but
i
think
there
is
a
different
standard
that
applies,
where
that
this
court
is
recognized
and
developed
where
you
are
reviewing
a
court
fashioned
plan
and
this
is
a
court
fashioned
plan
and
this
plan
--
that
to
me
as
my
understanding
of
the
rule
that
you
first
set
out
in
connor
v.
johnson
as
a
general
rule.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
well,
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
appears
as
the
attorney
for
the
secretary
of
state
of
north
dakota
because
he
is
the
state
officer
that's
charged
with
enforcing
the
election
laws
and
we
sought
an
injunction
against
him
and
i
don't
know
that
the
attorney
general's
office
has
any
more
--
provides
any
more
basis
for
saying
this
reflects
state
policy,
then
the
legislature,
that
the
people
were
ultimately
in
north
dakota
decide
what
policy
is
and
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
the
attorney
general
is
defending
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
right,
but
there
is
a
distinction
because
it
would
not
be
a
fair
conclusion
to
say
that
after
all
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
is
the
governor,
and
he
has
and
this
is
referred
to
particularly
in
judge
bight's
dissent,
a
veto
message
which
he
refers
to
and
as
the
chief
executive
officer,
he
states
in
that
veto
message
to
this
legislative
plan
that
was
adopted
and
then
defeated
on
referral
his
opposition
to
the
legislative
plan
based
on
the
establishment
of
large
multimember
districts.
so,
i
do
not
think
that,
there
is
at
best,
that
the
appellee
in
this
case
is
faced
with
the
situation
where
there
is
no
discernible
state
policy,
no
identifiable
one
pro
or
con
because
if
you
put
aside
our
traditions.
but
to
say
that
the
state
of
north
dakota
is
here,
as
a
jurisdiction
saying
this
is
our
policy
and
our
policy
is
in
favor
of
large
multimember
districts,
that
is
not
really
not
the
situation
at
all.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
the
state
was
not
a
party
to
this
case,
it's
just
the
secretary
of
the
state.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
no
he
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
right,
the
secretary
of
state
is
presumably,
and
presumably
the
attorney
general
of
north
dakota
is
satisfied.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
right,
but
the
governor
is
not
satisfied
nor
are
the
people
satisfied.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
the
governor
has
got
a
party,
but
the
governor
couldn't
be
a
party
because
he
doesn't
enforce
the
election
law.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
he
is
speaking
for
the
secretary
of
state,
if
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
he
is
speaking
for
him
as
a
state
officer,
right?
mr.
john
d.
kelly
my
only
point
is
that
if
in
fact,
this
is
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
state
policy
favoring
multimember
districts
that,
that
is
not
a
bare
conclusion
to
be
drawn
by
a
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
attorney
general
are
attempting
to
support
and
justify
this
court
imposed
plan.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
well,
we
have
been
waiting
for
ten
years
and
more
and
as
i
say
in
all
candor
there
is
no
reasonable
prospect
that
they
are
going
to.
in
the
few
remaining
moments
if
there,
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
second
issue
involves
population
disparities
and
these
disparities
in
this
plan
exceed
those
that
were
involved
in
the
virginia
case
and
there
is
contrary
to
the
virginia
case,
no
justifiable
state
policy
that
would
support
the
type
of
deviations
we're
involved
with
here.
the
two
that
were
offered
were
a
bit
--
there
is
a
geographic
barrier,
the
missouri
river.
indeed
it
is
a
geographic
barrier,
but
it
provides
no
barrier
at
all
to
the
establishment
of
equal
population
districts.
that
is
not
a
problem
and
that's
covered
in
detail
in
the
brief.
the
second
point
was
is
that
north
dakota
is
a
small
agricultural
rural
state
and
it
is
just
not
that
important
to
get
precise
districts.
well,
north
dakota
has
a
traditional
that
it
carried
on
at
this
last
election
of
having
extremely
close
election
results
and
the
individual's
voting
power
in
a
small
state,
the
one
person's
vote
really
can
have
a
substantial
impact.
and
with
the
type
of
issues
that
are
going
to
be
presented
to
the
north
dakota
legislature
involving
not
only
the
future
of
north
dakota,
but
large
parts
of
the
nation
involving
the
development
of
resources,
it
seems
to
me
that
equity
and
fairness
and
to
say
nothing
of
the
constitution,
requires
a
better
job
of
drawing
districts
lines
in
terms
of
establishing
fair
apportionment
within
the
dobson
plan,
which
was
basically
designed
to
meet
an
emergency
and
had
as
one
of
its
standards
to
draw
the
new
lines
as
closely
as
you
could
to
the
existing
lines
which
were
being
stricken
because
they
provided
a
representation
that
was
violative
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
thank
you.
mr.
john
d.
kelly
just
two
points.
in
response
to
question
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
mr.
sand,
i
would
point
out
that
the
one
senator
tor
two
house
member
ratio
has
been
overall
the
standard
since
statehood
your
honor
except
insofar
as
our
original
constitution
provided
that
both
houses
should
be
--
districts
should
be
of
equal
populations
to
the
extent
that,
that
could
be
done,
but
the
problem
was
that
since
there
was
a
restriction
in
senate
districts
and
not
taking
part
of
one
county
and
making
it
part
of
a
senate
district
that
involved
another
county,
that
were
necessarily
population
imbalances.
and
in
order
to
correct
that
situation,
certain
districts
were
given
additional
house
members,
but
the
vast
majority
of
districts
since
statehood
have
always
had
two
house
members
and
one
senator.
and
so
that
well
it's
been
an
absolute
tradition
of
one
senator
and
two
house
members,
the
overall
tradition
is
clearly
on
that
kind
of
a
basis.
insofar
as
mr.
chief
justice,
your
reference
to
the
disparities
in
populations,
based
under
dobson
plan,
i
think
we're
talking
about
between
in
terms
of
people
just
about
something
between
2400
and
2500
people
difference
between
the
largest
or
most
under
represented
district
or
smallest
or
more
over--
most
representative
district
and
i
think
there
was
an
appendix
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
there
is
an
appendix
on
page
a-6
and
a-7
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
d.
kelly
but
in
any
event
the
small
population
and
each
vote
is
important.
