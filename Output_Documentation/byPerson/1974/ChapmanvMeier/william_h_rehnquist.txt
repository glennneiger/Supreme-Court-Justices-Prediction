william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
were
to
reverse
the
judgment,
as
you
ask
us
to
do,
well
what
sort
of
instructions
are
you
suggesting
that
we
give
to
the
district
or
you
wouldn't
want
us
to
draw
a
plan
here,
i
take
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
that
wasn't
an
inexorable
rule
in
either
of
those
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
say
that
the
fact
that
the
legislature
adopted
a
plan
that
encompassed
multimember
districts
even
though
it
was
ultimately
defeated
in
a
referendum,
can't
be
used
by
the
district
court
as
any
indication
of
a
state
policy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
really
your
troubles
all
stem
from
the
federal
courts
having
gotten
into
the
thing
in
the
first
place,
don't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
here
the
state
is
defending
the
plan
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
mahan,
for
example,
it
was
the
state
that
came
to
us
and
challenged
the
ruling
of
the
three-judge
district
court
which
had
revived
the
legislative
reapportionment
plan.
and
in
here
it
seems
to
me,
you're
in
somewhat
different
posture
because,
here
the
state
is
defending
what
the
district
court
has
done?
