justice
potter
stewart
is
this
legislative
assembly
it
was
elected
under
this
plan
and
presumably
has
a
vested
interest
in
the
status
quo.
now
it's
been
true
since
1965?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
counties
are
there
in
your
state?
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
the
old
system
before
the
court
got
into
it,
how
many
senators
were
there?
justice
potter
stewart
and
twice
as
many
representatives?
justice
potter
stewart
per
county?
justice
potter
stewart
per
district,
right.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
only
as
result
of
the
court
intervention,
is
it
right?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
general
the
fact
that
this
is
satisfactory
to
the
people
of
your
state,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
rightly
or
wrongly,
this
doesn't
cut
any
ice
at
all.
you
remember
lucas
again
st
the
colorado
assembly
in
which
the
people
of
the
state
had
accepted,
by
vote
had
accepted
that
plan
and
the
court
said
nonetheless,
it's
unconstitutional
or
even
going
back
to
baker
against
carr,
the
state,
the
officials
of
the
state
were
wholly
satisfied
with
that
system,
so
they
told
us.
they
were
defending
that
system
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
doesn't
--
doesn't
rightly
or
wrongly
as
i
say
under
the
precedence
of
this
court,
that
doesn't
cut
any
ice
whatsoever?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
had
those
other
--
