mr.
paul
m.
sand
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
please
the
court.
counsel
has
stated
the
historic
development
fairly
accurately,
but
i
believe
he
listed
somethings
as
being
no
more
technical
than
the
real
practical
situation
as
it
existed.
prior
to
1965,
true,
north
dakota
had
a
senatorial
district
and
they
had
multimember
house
districts
and
it
was
basically
on
the
county
setup.
the
counties
could
not
be
taken
and
attached
to
another
part
of
a
county,
but
could
be
moved
together,
several
counties
could
be
comprised
to
consist
one
senatorial
district.
but,
in
the
more
populous
counties,
the
county
could
be
divided
and
in
fact
there
were
several
that
were
divided
in
which
the
legislature
created
one,
two
or
three
senatorial
districts.
but,
in
those
districts
that
were
created,
the
county
remained
as
the
basic
unit
and
for
all
practical
purposes
in
the
legislature
and
in
discussion
of
the
senators
that
we
referred
to
as
the
senators
from
cass
county
even
though
cass
county
had
two
senatorial
districts.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
53,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
49.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
no
sir,
there
we
had
no
1:2
ratio.
the
1:2
ratio
came
into
being
in
1965
by
the
federal
district
court
fashioned
plan,
but
prior
to
that
time,
we
had
variants
from
anywhere
from
one
representative
to
five.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
per
district.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
even
though
the
ordinary
reference
was
to
the
county,
but
in
some
counties
we
had
more
than
one
senatorial
district.
and
true,
the
legislature
has
toiled
with
this
problem
and
has
made
some
very
sincere
efforts.
but
about
in
1960
through
our
constitutional
process,
a
constitutional
amendment
was
adopted,
which
froze
the
senatorial
districts
as
they
existed.
it
also
created
a
board
which
was
charged
with
a
duty
of
reapportioning
the
state
if
the
legislature
failed
to
do
so.
this
board
consisted
of
the
two
majority
leaders
of
each
house,
the
secretary
of
state,
the
attorney
general,
and
the
chief
justice
of
a
state
of
north
dakota.
they
labored
with
this
problem,
long
and
heavy,
but
because
of
provisions
of
section
35,
it
was
just
impossible
to
do
what
the
language
provided.
and
as
a
result
of
that
a
reapportionment
plan
that
was
adopted
by
this
committee
was
declared
unconstitutional.
and
then
from
there
the
actions
were
brought
in
the
federal
courts.
and
then
from
1965,
we
have
developed
a
different
pattern,
and
this
is
where
the
federal
district
court
fashioned
plan,
provided
for
senatorial
districts
with
more
than
one
senator.
but
the
ratio
was
for
each
senator
they
would
have
two
representatives.
now,
this
plan
stayed
in
existence,
and
the
legislature
in
1971
did
not
reapportion.
there
were
feeble
efforts
made,
but
if
i
can
summarize
some
of
comments
made
by
the
legislators,
they
said,
we
just
don't
know
where
to
go,
what
we
can
do,
and
some
even
said,
well
let
the
court
do
it.
well,
these
are
some
of
the
difficulties
for
the
legislature.
when
this
action
was
initially
brought
and
a
temporary
plan
established
a
bi-partisan
committee
was
created
for
the
purposes
of
proposing
a
plan
to
the
1973
legislature.
this
committee
worked
hard
and
long
and
developed
what
i
would
say
a
very
god
plan,
as
far
as
the
variance,
but
because
it
contained
multimember
districts
the
governor
vetoed
the
plan.
it
was
overridden
and
then
referred
to
the
people,
about
the
same
an
initiated
constitutional
measure
was
submitted
to
the
people.
this
measure
provided
for
a
board
to
reapportion
the
state,
and
also
provided
that
the
board
provide
for
single-member
districts.
now,
when
the
people
rejected
both
of
these
measures,
we
had
to
assume
that
the
people
were
in
effect
saying
leave
us
be,
let's
us
have
the
plan
that
we
have
now.
the
constant
changing
of
boundary
lines
i
believe,
hurts
representative
form
of
government
more
so
or
equally
so
than
the
variance
in
population.
identification
with
the
district
lines
is
an
essential
element
of
representation
and
the
people
when
they
rejected
the
court
--
no,
the
legislative
plan,
my
impression
was
that
was
rejected
because
it
broke
entirely
too
many
county
lines.
to
say
that
was
rejected
because
it
had
multimember
districts
flies
in
the
face
of
the
people's
rejection
of
the
constitutional
measure
which
would
have
provided
for
single-member
districts.
and
on
that
basis,
we
are
representing
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota
even
though
counsel
may
have
some
reservations
about
that.
the
secretary
of
state,
of
course
is
a
state
constitutional
officer,
and
the
attorney
general
by
law
and
by
common
law
in
the
state
of
north
dakota
represents
the
people
there
though
we
have
no
reservation
whatsoever
that
the
attorney
general
and
the
secretary
of
state
van
meier
representing
the
people
of
the
state
of
north
dakota.
so
historically,
we
have
consistently
had
multimember
districts
for
the
house
to
the
state
of
north
dakota
and
from
1965
we
have
had
multimember
districts
for
the
senate.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
right.
now,
prior
to
the
court's
intervention
and
they
are
recognizing
also
that
section
35
of
this
constitutional
menu
which
prose
the
districts,
i
think
of
that
point
the
state
actually
operated
what
we
would
refer
to
as
a
little
federal
system.
the
senate
had
area,
the
house
was
on
population,
even
though
the
counties
in
the
several
instances
were
gathered
together
to
make
an
area
and
in
another
instances
counties
were
divided
to
make
an
area,
but
it
was
still
basically
a
concept
of
the
little
federal
system.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
no
they
were
justice
blackmun.
they
were
anywhere
from
one
to
five
depending
on
the
population.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
since
1965.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
correct
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
i
think
we
had
quite
a
few.
with
two
representatives
we
had
a
seizable
number,
i
would
just
recall
here
at
the
moment
i
think
about
five
or
six
that
had
more
than
two.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
in
the
larger
counties
like
cass,
grand
forks,
barnes,
richland,
ward
and
the
larger
counties
or
the
counties
that
had
the
larger
cities.
we
also
believe
that
where
the
legislature
--
where
the
court
is
required
to
fashion
a
plan,
that
the
court
should
fashion
a
plan
which
is
somewhat
patterned
after
the
state
plan
in
existence.
now
true,
a
plan
can
be
developed
which
would
cut
down
the
variance,
but
in
order
to
accomplish
that
and
at
the
same
kind
maintain
some
respect
for
county
lines,
we'd
have
to
reduce
the
number
of
senators
and
representatives,
the
legislative
bodies
as
a
whole
would
have
to
be
reduced.
but
as
far
as
the
number
of
senators
and
representatives,
i
think
this
is
basically
the
judgment
of
the
people.
we
have
had
consistently
representation
in
the
house
from
98
to
101
or
in
that
vicinity
and
49
to
51
in
the
senate.
now,
if
the
court
would
have
gone
to
a
reduced
number,
yes
our
variances
may
not
be
that
great,
but
i
think
the
number
should
be
respected
because
it
gives
a
greater
division
amongst
the
electorate
and
in
the
same
way
it
also
gives
members
in
the
house
and
the
senate
which
are
more
responsive
to
that
particular
area.
and
again
in
north
dakota
the
county
is
the
basic
political
sub
division.
the
county
performs
many
many
functions
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
state
and
to
break
up
the
county
lines
actually
destroys
the
responsiveness
to
the
county
needs
and
on
the
variance,
they
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
attempt
to
speak
about
accuracy
or
exactness
in
population
when
we
know
that
the
initial
census
is
not
accurate
in
itself.
as
this
court
has
said,
it
is
a
process,
but
it
is
not
necessarily
accurate.
we
have
in
our
brief
set
out,
a
few
of
the
cities
which
have
had
a
census
taken
since
the
1970
census
and
we
find
that
quite
a
few
of
them
have
grown
substantially
and
in
one
instance,
where
the
variance
was
11%
by
taking
the
new
population,
it
has
been
reduced
to
4%.
and
it
would
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
somewhat
inequitable
to
require
an
exact
mathematical
formula
based
upon
a
figure
which
is
initially
not
accepted
as
being
correct
and
then
go
from
there,
when
it's
reasonably
understood
that
in
the
matter
of
a
year
or
two,
those
population
figures
will
no
longer
be
representative,
and
we
operated
on
that
for
a
10-year
period.
and
in
the
state
of
north
dakota,
under
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
i
would
submit
that
a
population
variance
of
20%
or
in
that
area
is
not
out
of
line.
we
have
the
natural
barrier
to
contend
with
and
i
think
the
court
in
this
instance,
there
are
people
from
the
state,
they
know
the
needs,
they
know
the
area,
they
came
up
with
a
plan
that
is
satisfactory
to
the
state
of
north
dakota.
and
if
i
may
just
simply
repeat
that
when
the
elections
on
the
initiated
measure,
constitutional
measure
and
the
referendum
on
the
legislative
plan
were
rejected
by
the
people,
the
people
were
in
fact
saying,
leave
us
be
as
we
are
created.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
i
would
agree
with
that
justice
stewart.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
what
i
shouldn't
have
said
and
really
had
in
mind
was
that
within
the
constitutional
limits,
the
people
are
satisfied
with
the
state,
with
this
system
as
they
have
now
and
we
think
that
a
20%
variance
is
not
unconstitutional
under
these
conditions
and
if
the
people
are
satisfied
with
it
and
if
it
meets
the
constitutional
requirements,
then
there
should
be
no
change
made.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
chief
justice
burger,
in
that
respect,
in
the
small
number,
i
mean
these
percentages
really
can
be
in
a
sense
frightening
because
you
have
a
change
of
100
or
200
and
the
percentage
goes
way
out
whereas,
if
you
have
larger
numbers
you
can
have
this
--
mr.
paul
m.
sand
yes,
it
cuts
in
both
directions.
and
reason
why
we
believe
that
this
variation
is
justifiable
because
we
have
had
a
constant
change
in
population.
ironically,
we've
had
up
until
1970
a
decrescent
population,
but
also
a
change
from
world
to
urban
within
the
state.
but
from
1970
to
1974,
according
to
the
latest
report
in
the
us
world
news
based
upon
the
us
census,
the
state
of
north
dakota
has
gained
since
1970,
a
little
better
than
4%
population.
where
that
population
is
in
the
moment
i
am
not
prepared
to
say.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
right.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
right.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
now
well
that's
--
mr.
paul
m.
sand
right.
mr.
paul
m.
sand
thank
you.
