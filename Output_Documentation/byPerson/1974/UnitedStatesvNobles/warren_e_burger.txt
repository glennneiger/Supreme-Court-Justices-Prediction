we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
74-634,
united
states
against
nobles.
mr.
freidman,
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
in
this
particular
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it's
just
anticipating
the
problem,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
allis.
before
you'll
get
started,
let
me
put
one
question
to
you
in
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
kilkenny
in
the
ninth
circuit.
he
made
the
statement
we
can
assume
that
appellant's
counsel
was
not
playing
games
and
that
the
memorandum
that
is
the
notes
that
were
taken
probably
made
no
reference
to
the
impeachment
questions
propounded
to
the
witness'
compliment.
otherwise,
there
would
be
no
target
for
reason
for
the
refusal
to
produce
them
now,
that's
the
end
of
the
quote.
can
you
suggest
any
hypothesis
why
if
the
statement
was
in
fact
impliedly
represented
to
the
court
that
it
would
not
help
the
defendant
to
have
it
made
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
you
can
deal
with
that
anytime
you
wanted
in
the
order
of
your
argument.
if
you
want
me
to
take
it
up
right
now
if
you
don't
want
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
fine.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
we
know
that
any
of
the
judges
did
if
they
were
under
seal
from
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
were
you
representing
the
defendants
generally
or
representing
this
defendant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
was
your
primary
obligation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
that
suggested
by
my
earlier
question
and
now
by
justice
powell's
question,
if
the
representation
is
made
by
inference
or
contained
them
and
report,
why
wouldn't
that
help
your
client?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
judge
think
he
would
exercise
all
the
matter
that
was
not
relevant
to
the
precise
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
intact
to
the
subject
of
excising
and
not
open
new
to
this
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
what
about
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
allis,
so
when
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
the
government
undertook
it
had
mr.
bond
testified
and
the
government
would
then
be
entitled
cross-examine
and
you'll
agree.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
the
government
ask
him
whether
he
had
refreshed
his
recollection
about
the
interview
by
reference
to
his
notes
that
were
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
there
quite
an
old
established
rule
that
notes
used
to
refresh
recollection
of
witness
maybe
examined
by
the
opposing
counsel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
what's
the
problem
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
you
can't
know
that.
this
man
is
a
regular
investigator
for
the
public
defenders'
office,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
inquiring
and
interviewing
dozens
of
people
in
many,
many
cases
i
would
assume,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
might
the
counter
part
of
the
investigator
for
the
law
enforcement
agency.
isn't
that
reasonable
and
wouldn't
it
be
reasonable
for
it
quite
to
assume
that
any
careful
lawyer
would
require
his
investigator
to
refresh
his
recollection
from
his
own
reports
before
appearing
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
anything
further
mr.
freidman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
