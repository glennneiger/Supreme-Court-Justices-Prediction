mr.
paul
l.
freidman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
in
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
issue
as
we
see
it
is
whether
a
trial
judge
has
discretion
during
the
trial
of
the
criminal
case
to
order
a
defendant
to
produce
relevant
portions
of
a
defense
investigator's
report.
and
specifically,
we
are
referring
to
the
time
after
the
defendant
has
offered
that
investigator
as
a
witness
in
his
own
behalf
and
after
the
direct
testimony
of
that
investigator
who
was
called
fro
the
specific
purpose
of
impeaching
government
witnesses
who
already
have
testified.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
well,
it
really
is
directed
to
the
witness
because
at
his
report.
he
had
a
copy
of
that
report
more
than
likely
although
the
record
is
not
clear
on
this
defense
counsel
clearly
had
a
copy
of
the
report
at
the
time
of
trial
but
it
is
a
report
that
was
prepared
by
the
investigator
and
it's
his
report.
so,
it
really
is
an
order
to
the
defense
counsel
or
the
defense
witness
to
turnover
that
report.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
this
is
the
central
district
of
california
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
the
central
district
of
california,
the
trial
was
in
los
angeles.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
apparently,
that
does
not
occur
in
the
central
district
of
california
as
a
matter
of
practice.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
judging
from
the
transcript
in
this
case,
i
sincerely
doubt
that.
our
position
basically
is
that
cases
like
jencks,
and
gordon,
and
goldman
of
this
court
really
support
the
view
that
a
trial
judge
has
that
kind
of
a
discretion.
in
the
absence
any
countervailing
legislation
or
rule
and
we
say
that
there
is
none.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
it
is
sort
of
a
reverse
jencks
case,
yes.
and
if
you
look
back
at
jencks,
i
think
that
anyone
would
have
to
agree
that
jencks
--
the
jencks
case
are
began
on
a
premise
that
judges
have
this
kind
of
discretion
and
that
the
only
purpose
of
congress
in
passing
the
jencks
act
was
to
limit
that
discretion
which
existed.
it
addressed
itself
only
to
the
problem
of
requiring
the
government
to
turnover
certain
things
to
the
defense
because
it
was
concern
with
fishing
expeditions,
national
security
things,
that
sort
of
interest
to
the
government
but
do
not
address
the
problem
of
this
case
at
all.
congress
could
address
it
but
it
hasn't
and
we
submit
that
the
court
hasn't
addressed
it
in
rule
16
either
because
rule
16
is
a
pretrial
rule
and
it
does
not
really
govern
once
the
trial
begins.
the
facts
of
this
case
very
briefly
indicate
why
it
was
necessary
here
or
appropriate
here
for
a
judge
to
exercise
his
discretion,
respondent
on
three
others
who
are
charged
with
federal
bank
robbery.
three
of
the
robbers
were
captured
on
film
during
the
bank
robbery,
one
who
was
later
identified
as
respondent
in
the
trial
was
standing
under
the
surveillance
camera
and
he
was
the
only
one
not
captured
on
the
film.
the
government's
evidence
against
him
came
from
two
eyewitnesses;
a
bank
teller
and
a
salesman
visiting
the
bank.
it
was
those
two
eyewitnesses
that
the
defense
tried
to
impeach
through
the
investigator.
first,
they
cross-examined
the
eyewitnesses
asking
one
whether
or
not
he
had
told
the
investigator
that
he'd
only
seen
the
back
of
the
robber
under
the
camera.
the
witness
denied
having
said.
the
second
witness
was
asked
whether
or
not
he
had
told
the
investigator
that
to
him
all
blacks
look-alike.
the
witness
denied
having
said
it.
and
at
that
point,
the
prosecutor
requested
that
he'd
be
able
to
see
the
relevant
portions
of
the
report.
respondent's
counsel
denied
refuse
to
produce
them.
the
court
indicated
it's
inclination
to
order
them
produced
but
waited
for
further
oral
argument.
and
then
later
said
that
he
would
order
them
produced
but
only
after
the
investigator
testified
and
only
the
relevant
portions
of
the
report
and
they
offer
their
services
and
camera
to
review
the
report
and
excise
extraneous
matters.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
the
court
made
the
ruling
prior
to
the
defense
investigator
being
called
to
the
stand
and
he
said
that,
he
would
require
production
of
relevant
portions
after
the
direct
testimony
of
the
investigator.
now,
earlier
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
the
defense
had
called
them
to
the
stand.
chronologically,
what
happened
was
when
the
defense
of
the
prosecution
witness
hoffman
and
van
gamoran
and
testified.
he
was
asked
whether
you'd
had
an
interview
with
the
investigator.
he
said
he
couldn't
recall.
he
was
showing
a
piece
of
paper
purporting
to
be
a
part
of
the
investigator's
report.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
cross-examination
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
by
a
defense
counsel.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
right.
he
said
the
piece
of
paper
refresh
his
recollection
but
that
he
did
not
recall
saying
that
he'd
only
seen
the
back
of
the
man.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
and
in
fact
he
did
not
see
only
the
back
of
the
man.
the
second
government
witness
was
cross-examined
about
whether
it
had
the
interview.
he
was
--
his
recollection
did
not
have
to
be
refreshed
because
he
remembered
the
interview.
he
denied
having
made
the
statement,
to
him,
all
blacks
look-alike.
there
was
then
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
would
be
able
to
see
the
relevant
portion
of
the
report
then
on
air
before
his
redirect
of
the
government
witness
hoffman.
that
was
never
produced.
the
government
proceeded
with
its
direct
examination.
there
was
then
subsequent
argument
at
which
the
court
ruled
that
if
the
investigator
was
to
be
called
for
this
purpose
that
the
relevant
portions
of
the
report
would
have
to
be
turned-over
after
his
direct
testimony.
defense
counsel,
respondent's
counsel,
apparently
then
conferred
with
other
members
of
the
public
defenders
service
and
they
concluded
that
there
was
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
other
reasons
sixth
amendment
privilege
not
to
turn
this
over.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
he
had,
(voice
overlap)he
updated
some
mild
protest
but
he
had
aptly
asked
yes.
and
so
then,
the
defense
investigator
was
called
to
the
stand
and
i
believe
it
was
the
prosecutor
so
that
before
we
proceed
with
that
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
the
defense
putting
on
its
case.
the
government
had
rested,
there
been
motions
for
judgment
of
acquittal
by
all
defense
counsel
they
had
been
denied.
defense
had
put
on
a
number
of
witnesses
prior
to
calling
the
investigator
and
then
called
the
investigator.
the
prosecutor
as
to
approach
the
bench
and
said,
“i
would
like
a
proffer
as
to
what
he's
going
to
testify
about.”
defense
counsel,
mr.
allis
here,
made
the
proffer
and
his
proffer
was
that
he
would
testify
about
some
photographs
taken
in
the
bank
apparently
relating
to
lighting
conditions
and
so
on.
and
also,
he
would
impeach
the
witness
hoffman
and
i
believe
also
the
witness
hoffman,
and
i
believe
also
the
witness
van
gamoran.
the
court
said,
“well,
my
earlier
ruling
still
stands
have
you
turned
this
over?”
and
it
was
then
subsequent
argument
which
mr.
allis
indicated
he
would
not
turn
it
over,
he
felt
that
whether
these
privileges
involve
and
the
court
then
made
clear.
again,
the
limited
nature
of
his
ruling
was
not
the
entire
report
but
only
the
relevant
parts
of
it
relating
to
statements
that
may
have
been
made
by
hoffman
and
van
gamoran's
bond
and
that
irrelevant
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
to
the
investigator
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
right.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
limited
to
the
direct
testimony
of
the
investigator
as
it
relate
it
to
his
interviews
with
those
witnesses
and
that
if
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
i
think
it's
the
same
exact
jencks
limitation,
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
was
--
i'm
sorry,
was
who
about
to
use
the
reports?
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
it
is
not
clear
from
the
record
whether
he
was
going
to
use
the
reports
to
refresh
his
recollection
while
on
the
stand
and
it
was
never
developed
because
this
subject
matter
was
not
going
into.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
entirely
true
and
i
think
that's
it.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
i
think
we
have
a
bigger
problem
in
this
case,
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
i'll
attempt
to
solve
it.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
but,
i
think
that
the
rules
are
obviously
were
not
in
affect.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
and
are
not
in
affect
until
july
1st
of
this
year.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
yes,
and
he
did
so
testify.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
alright,
at
the
bench,
they
were
discussing
the
matter
the
judge
reiterated
his
ruling,
made
clear
that
it
was
limited
to
only
the
relevant
portions.
and
again
made
clear
that
irrelevancies
could
be
excise,
he
offered
his
services
to
in
camera
to
help
in
the
excision
of
these
things
and
defense
counsel
nevertheless
refuse
to
turnover
any
portion
of
the
reports
standing
on
his
privileges.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
yes,
he
would
not
turn
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
correct
and
the
court
--
at
some
point,
there
were
some
discussion
about
why
i
let
them
testify
and
then
striking
the
courts
and
well,
i
think
we
can
rule
on
this
before
the
witness
and
i
want
to
know
your
intentions,
you're
an
officer
of
the
court.
and
i'm
going
to
preclude
this
testimony
if
you
say
that
you
will
not
turn
it
over
and
that's
--
that
was
the
ruling
of
the
court.
he
testified
this
to
other
matters,
other
witnesses
testified
and
the
jury
returns
the
verdict
of
guilty.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
in
a
two-to-one
decision.
and
they
found
that
the
trial
court's
order
was
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
also
a
violation
of
rule
16
(c)'s
limitation
and
discovery
to
the
prosecutor
by
the
defense.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
to
the
trial
court,
the
material
in
the
defense
investigator's
report
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
was
--
what
was
turned
over
to
the
trial
court,
i
believe,
under
seal
so
i've
never
seen
it.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
is
a
proffer
as
to
what
bond
would
testify
to.
as
a
supplement
to
that
proffer,
counsel
made
an
oral
representation
in
court.
that
in
fact
the
investigator
had
taken
notes
and
had
prepare
to
report
from
those
notes
of
his
interviews
with
the
two
witnesses
and
it
was
that
that
counsel
on
the
court
had
been
discussing
when
they
had
made
reference
to
be
investigator's
report.
he
said
at
one
point,
there
in
fact
are
two
reports
and
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
is
meant
by
that
whether
he
was
at
one
point
referring
to
the
notes
and
in
another
point
referring
to
the
report.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
the
investigator
testified
as
to
other
matters.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
but
not
as
to
these
two
witnesses.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
because
the
court
ruled
that
if
he
or
counsel
refused
to
comply
with
the
order
to
turnover
the
report
that
he
would
be
precluded
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
--
in
testifying
in
the
subject
matter.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
and
so
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
no,
i
think
that
under
jencks
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
well,
the
court's
or
the
court
ruled
prior
to
his
taking
the
stand
but
he
made
clear
that
his
order
would
only
apply
after
the
direct
testimony
said,
“after
the
direct
testimony,
you
must
turnover
these
portions
of
the
report
but
tell
me
now
whether
you're
going
to
comply
with
that
order
and
if
you're
not
going
to
comply
rather
than
what
i'm
testifying
then
striking
i
will
do
the
functional
equivalent
which
is
to
prevent
him
from
going
in
to
the
subject
matter
at
all.”
and
i
think
the
same
thing
would
happen
under
jencks
if
the
trial
judge
was
farsighted
enough
to
deal
with
the
problem
before.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
exactly.
his
ruling
was
made
before
the
witness
was
--
who
took
the
stand
but
it
was
to
apply
only
after
the
direct
testimony
of
that
witness.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
right,
but
the
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
the
ordinary
jencks
procedure.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
well,
other
than
that?
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
right.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
and
by
the
trial
judges
order,
there
was
no
obligation
to
turn
it
over
until
after
he
completed
his
direct
testimony.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
i'm
not
sure
if
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
a
prosecutor
were
to
make
that
kind
of
a
statement
in
advance,
all
the
witness
being
called
it
all
for
whatever
reason,
it
just
doesn't
happen
that
much.
the
judge
could
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
i
don't
think
he
would
be
required
to
let
him
testify
and
then
strike
it.
i
just
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
right.
i
mean,
there
are
additional
sanctions
that
can
be
enforced
against
the
government
that
cannot
be
enforced
against
the
defense.
it's
certainly
a
much
lesser
sanction
than
dismissing
the
indictment
or
something
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
well,
other
than
the
fact
that
613
(a)
didn't
govern
but
it
may
govern
on
a
retrial.
it
is
our
position
that
613
(a)
does
not
deal
with
this
precise
problem
and
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
i
think
it
will
survive
613
(a)
because
if
you
look
at
the
history
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
well,
i
don't
think
that
refreshing
recollection
has
to
be
a
precondition
to
the
trial
judge
exercising
his
discretion
in
this
kind
of
a
circumstance.
613
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
yes,
it
will
be
because
613
as
it
was
originally
came
from
the
court
required
did
not
provide
judges'
discretion
but
said
whether
refreshing
was
done
while
testifying
or
prior
testifying
would
be
turned
over.
congress
modified
the
second
one
before
testifying
but
they
did
not
deal
with
what
we
contend
as
the
third
situation
which
is
this
situation
here.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it
can
be
use
for
purposes
of
cross-examination
and
then
the
normal
rules
of
evidence
would
apply.
if
it
turns
out
to
be
a
prior
consistent
statement
of
hoffman
and
van
gamoran,
the
question
then
would
be
whether
you
could
introduce
it
to
buttress
their
testimony
but
turns
out
to
be
a
prior
consistent
statement
of
the
investigator
that
the
same
question
would
result.
and
maybe
after
july
1,
1975
relate
a
one
d
would
answer
that
question.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
the
two
questions
are
clearly
distinguished
but
i
think
jencks
said,
that
i
think
claremore
said,
i
think
campbell
said
it,
that
production
for
the
purposes
of
cross-examination.
the
prerequisites
for
that
are
only
to
show
that
it's
relevant
and
relates
to
the
direct
testimony
can
be
use
for
all
sorts
of
purposes.
omissions
from
the
report
might
be
relevant
and
a
different
order
presentation
and
the
report
might
be
relevant
whether
it's
a
statement
consistent
or
inconsistent
that
would
be
admissible
and
evidence
is
a
question
that
the
judge
would
rule
on
somewhere
down
the
road
and
that
has
nothing
directly
to
do
with
it
produce
ability,
and
with
its
usefulness,
and
the
issue
of
testing
credibility
and
getting
up
the
truth
which
is
what
we
think
this
case
really
is
about.
and
our
basic
position
is
that
under
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
the
same
kinds
of
principles
that
apply
to
the
prosecutor
when
he
has
a
prior
statement
and
he
calls
a
witness
who
has
made
that
prior
statement
or
prior
report.
i
would
apply
to
the
defense
when
they
call
a
witness
for
the
purpose
of
impeaching
government
witnesses
who
may
have
interviewed,
and
whom
they've
taken
statements
from.
and
the
only
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
mr.
nobles
the
defendant?
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
or
the
attorney.
well
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
i
don't
think
so.
we
--
and
in
fact
the
state
cases
which
we
cite
damon,
saunders
and
montague
were
cases
where
attorneys
acted
as
their
own
investigators.
we're
not
talking
about
attorney-client
privilege.
the
privilege
rule
that
to
have
been
proposed
which
would
have
expanded
attorney-client
privilege
to
also
encompass
representatives
of
the
attorney
was
not
passed
by
congress
and
the
common
law
of
privileges
prevail.
and
therefore,
even
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
said
case
that
the
attorney-client
privilege
would
not
protect
this
material.
secondly,
we
submit
it
is
not
confidential
in
the
sense
that
communications
covered
by
the
attorney-client
privilege
have
protection,
certainly
not.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
the
statements
would
be
protected
pretrial
from
discover
in
a
civil
action.
i
doubt
that
they
would
be
protected
in
trial
from
production
if
the
person
who
had
made
the
statement
of
the
report
had
been
called
as
a
witness.
if
in
a
civil
action
someone
is
hired
as
a
representative
on
the
attorney
to
do
some
investigation
or
to
do
statistical
study
or
whatever
else.
this
maybe
governed
by
the
work
product
rule
in
hickman,
maybe
govern
by
the
protection
for
statements
in
hickman
pretrial
but
if
he's
called
as
a
witness
to
testify
about
those
very
matters.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
from
pretrial
discovery,
yes
under
hickman
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
if
the
witness
himself
took
the
notes
of
what
the
other
person
had
said.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
but
the
lawyer
chooses
to
call
him
as
a
witness.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
well
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
well,
isn't
that
what
the
criminal
trial
is
all
about.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
and
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
i
think
if
they
had
taken
written
notes
and
testified
about
the
content
of
those
notes,
substance
of
those
notes
that
the
prosecutor
had
to
be
able
to
see
them
for
purposes
of
cross-examination.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
and
the
defense
attorney?
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
if
he's
the
court's
witness,
then
perhaps
both
counsel
entitled
to
see
the
notes.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
no,
i
mean
the
purpose
whether
the
new
rule
applies
or
not.
we
think
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
cases
like
jencks
and
gordon,
so
the
judges
have
discretion.
we're
not
asking
for
a
rule
that
says
that
judges
must
order
the
stuff
turned
over
in
every
single
case.
what
we're
talking
about
is
whether
in
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case
and
these
circumstances
pointed
it
up
so
well
where
a
man
is
called
for
the
very
purpose
of
impeaching
the
government's
key
witnesses
which
is
perfectly
legitimate
obviously
and
yet
says
i've
got
something
here
which
would
help
you
to
impeach
me.
he
can't
be
impeached.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
right.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
you
mean
of
a
defense
cross-examination
of
the
government.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
there
was
a
request
by
the
prosecutor
at
that
time
for
the
notes.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
we
thank
him
and
we
make
this
argument
in
our
brief
too.
although,
it's
not
necessary
for
decision
in
this
because
of
the
way
it
comes
up
that
under
rule
613
(a)
of
the
new
federal
rules
that
end.
we
would
have
really
then
entitled
to
those
statements
earlier.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
in
the
case
of
van
gamoran,
the
prosecutor
made
the
request
that
the
witness
will
be
showing
the
statement
and
that
he
too
the
prosecutor
be
showing
it.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that
was
done.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
i
would
think
so,
yes.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
right,
which
creates
more
problems
i
agree
and
does
rule
613.
so,
it
maybe
that
the
prosecutor
would
be
entitled
on
a
retrial
for
these
documents
early
or
not
but
we
still
think
that
that
the
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
well,
for
one
thing,
the
respondent
makes
a
whole
slew
of
constitutional
arguments
that
would
stand
in
the
way
of
the
common
law,
jencks
case
type
doctrine
that
we're
talking
about
if
he's
right.
and
we'll
also
stand
in
the
way
of
the
new
federal
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
right
and
my
point
is
that
we
--
our
position
is
that
the
same
principles
of
jencks
apply
unless
there's
some
constitutional
privilege
that
stands
in
the
way
because
the
government
is
different
from
--
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
right.
and
the
same
concept
applies
in
terms
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
we
can
be
completely
right
and
what
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
mean.
and
yes,
if
there's
a
constitutional
impediment
to
them
working
in
favor
of
the
government.
so,
i
think
that
the
case
is
important
even
if
the
evidentiary
and
procedural
questions
are
somewhat
murky
because
of
the
transitional
period
we're
in,
to
deal
with
some
of
his
constitutional
claims
so
that
we
know
in
this
case
on
retrial
if
there'd
be
a
retrial
and
in
the
future
if
their
constitutional
impediments
to
the
government
getting
this
kind
of
material
in
this
kind
of
situation.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
that's
right.
so,
one
way
or
the
other,
there
will
be
one.
we
would
ask
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reverse.
we
think
the
constitutional
claims
are
without
merit
but
because
there
are
so
many
of
them
that
we
think
are
without
merit.
i'll
defer
to
my
opponent
at
this
point
reserved
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
just
very
briefly.
on
the
queens
case,
the
purpose
of
rule
613
was
to
get
rid
of
the
queens
case
and
so
that
you
don't
have
to
show
it
to
the
witness
you're
cross-examining
but
rule
613
applies
equally
to
oral
statements
and
the
written
statements
so
that
whole
argument
we
think
is
not
the
very
sound.
finally,
i
think
the
point
that
came
through
from
justice
white's
last
question.
we
call
it
waiver
in
our
brief,
if
there's
a
constitutional
involved
whether
it's
a
sixth
amendment
one
or
a
work
product
privilege
of
some
sort,
which
we
discussed
at
length
then
in
our
replied
brief
or
the
fifth
amendment
one
which
we
took
and
discussed
in
our
initial
brief.
refreshing
recollection
makes
no
difference
and
the
kind
of
discretion
we're
talking
about
in
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
makes
no
difference.
if
there
is
no
constitutional
right
or
whatever
kinds
of
privileges
may
exist
prior
to
calling
that
witness
once
the
subject
is
opened
up
by
defense
counsel,
himself.
the
same
principles
of
brown
versus
united
states
raffle
other
cases
of
this
court
may
clear
that
they
cannot
open
it
up,
only
partway.
there's
got
to
be
cross-examination,
all
we're
asking
for
is
a
decision
of
this
court
which
provides
trial
judges
with
the
kind
of
discretion
they
need.
mr.
paul
l.
freidman
all
i'm
saying
is
that
in
a
situation
like
this
with
the
problem
as
flagged
early
enough
and
it
can
be
discussed
and
there
can
be
legal
argument
out,
a
judge
does
not
have
to
let
the
witness
testify
and
then
strike
the
testimony
if
counsel
refuses
to
turn
it
over.
if
counsel
is
an
officer
of
the
court
says
that
he
had
made
the
decision
already
that
he's
not
going
to
turn
it
over
if
that
happens,
i
don't
think
the
judge
has
to
permit
the
direct
testimony.
it
doesn't
come
up
very
often
just
because
of
the
normal
course
of
things
but
it
happened
that
way
in
this
case
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
terms
of
our
argument.
