mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
if
i
may
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
well,
i
appreciate
that
if
i
could
reserve
it
for
a
little
bit
later.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
i
would
like
to
say
it
this
time
though
your
honor
that
the
statement
of
van
gamoran
of
the
statement
of
hoffman
which
was
the
written
report
of
the
investigator
were
place
under
seal
for
the
court
of
appeals.
the
statement
of
van
gamoran
was
defendants
exhibit
a
and
was
before
the
court
marked
as
an
exhibit
at
the
time
that
he
testified.
i
made
that
known
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
my
brief
but
apparently
the
descending
judge
did
not
look
at
those
statements.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
i
do
not
know
sir.
i'd
ask
the
district
court
at
the
end
of
trial
to
place
some
under
seal
for
the
court
of
appeals,
last
week
i
check
and
they're
still
in
the
safe
in
los
angeles.
it
fits
it
all
pertinent;
i'll
do
my
best
to
see
that
they
get
here.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
los
angeles.
it's
in
the
safe
in
los
angeles
sir.
i
was
the
trial
counsel
in
this
case,
before
the
trial,
i
sent
out
our
investigator
john
bond
to
interview
government
witnesses.
it
turned
out
at
the
trial
that
the
only
evidence
against
respondent
robert
lee
nobles
was
a
testimony
of
two
eyewitnesses
then
gamoran
and
hoffman.
the
court
of
appeals
itself
recognized
that
that
eyewitness
testimony
was
far
less
impressive
than
the
eyewitness
testimony
against
the
other
two
defendants.
there
was
a
lot
of
other
evidence
against
the
other
two
defendants
as
well
and
during
deliberations,
the
jury
had
the
entire
testimony
of
the
eyewitness
hoffman
read
back
to
it
so
that
the
jury
was
also
had
problems
with
the
eyewitness
testimony.
but
the
defendant
was
not
permitted
to
put
on
his
most
compelling
evidence
and
that
was
the
evidence
that
john
bond
would
have
testified
to
that
one
of
the
eyewitnesses
had
old
them
that
all
blacks
look
alike
prior
to
trial
and
the
other
had
told
them
that
the
he'd
also
seen
the
robber
from
behind.
this
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
they
were
mr.
justice
stewart.
that
testimony
of
john
bond
would've
completely
destroyed
the
credibility
of
these
two
eyewitnesses.
the
damage
to
the
defendant
was
exacerbated
beyond
repair
by
the
comments
of
the
prosecutor
in
closing
argument.
he
said,
although,
he
well
knew
that
the
--
that
john
bond
did
not
testify
because
of
illegal
disagreement
as
to
the
privilege
status
of
the
reports.
nevertheless,
he
told
the
jury
that
the
reason
behind
had
not
testified
was
because
the
witnesses
had
never
told
them
those
things
and
that
defense
counsel
is
merely
trying
to
inject
the
racial
element
into
the
trial.
the
preclusion
sanction
ordered
by
the
trial
court
judging
these
circumstances
your
honors,
is
much
too
harsh.
there
was
no
statute
or
rule
which
could've
forewarned
defense
counsel
or
defendant
that
he
would
have
to
turnover
these
reports.
this
isn't
a
case
like
for
example
such
as
williams
where
you
have
a
statute
which
may
include
with
it,
a
preclusion
sanction,
the
possibility
of
such
a
sanction.
this
is
virtually
unheard
of
procedure
by
a
trial
court
judge
who
punished
the
defendant
for
his
good
faith
refusal
to
obey
the
order
by
precluding
the
testimony
of
the
most
important
witness
for
the
defendant.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
your
honor,
i
objected
to
it
being
presented
to
the
jury
because
in
my
belief
at
that
time,
it
undercut
two
of
the
most
fundamental
interest
in
favor
of
the
defendant
in
our
criminal
justice
system.
i'd
like
to
perhaps
discuss
those
just
for
a
minute
and
with
reference
to
this
case.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
i
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
it
was
with
this
defendant
your
honor
and
this
case
presents
the
exact
problem,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
the
exact
words
would've
helped
the
client
because
the
exact
words
were
in
the
reports
as
those
reports
in
the
safe
now
show.
but
what
the
trial
court
judge
ordered
in
petitioner's
view
point
and
i
think
it's
the
reasonable
interpretation,
was
that
all
relevant
material
be
turned
over.
now,
once
all
relevant
material
in
the
report
is
order
turned
over
there
becomes
the
problem
of
what
is
relevant.
this
test
--
if
both
of
the
statements
of
these
eyewitnesses
had
to
do
with
the
quality
of
the
investigation
without
referring
to
this
specific
case
because
we
have
all
along
contended
that
the
information
is
confidential,
may
i
suggest
a
couple
of
hypothetical.
supposing,
the
one
witness
said,
“i
only
saw
the
robber
from
the
back,”
but
he
also
told
the
investigator
at
the
line
up,
“i
wasn't
sure
it
was
him,
until
i
heard
his
voice
and
then
i
was
sure.”
now
arguably,
that
statement
about
hearing
the
voice
is
relevant
to
the
quality
of
the
identification
of
the
eyewitness.
it's
our
position
that
facts
such
as
that
should
not
be
made
available
to
the
government.
there's
no
duty
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
make
that
known
to
the
government.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
he
did
sir.
but
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
sir.
if
the
judge
decided
that
that
was
not
specifically
relevant
to
the
issue
but
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
sir,
i
think
it's
at
least
arguable
and
i'd
certainly
believe
that
a
judge
could
decide
if
you
suggest
that
it
is
relevant
and
that
it
should
be
turned
over
and
that
would
violate
the
underlying
principle
of
our
system
of
justice
in
the
accusatory
system
whereby
the
government
must
bare
the
entire
burden.
the
government
has
a
duty
and
this
is
relevant
to
the
jencks
act
it
seems
to
me,
not
only
to
prove
the
defendant
guilty
but
to
make
sure
that
he
has
any
evidence
that's
material
to
his
defense.
the
jencks
act
is
part
of
that
duty
as
this
court's
decision
in
brady
versus
maryland
but
there's
no
reciprocal
duty
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
help
the
government
prove
guilty
people
guilty.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
well
sir,
mr.
justice
powell,
we
were
willing
to
have
bond
cross-examined.
the
only
protest
we
had
was
that
a
report
which
was
never
going
to
be
utilize
by
us,
produced
by
us
at
the
trial
should
be
produce.
we
contended
that
that
was
a
basically
an
internal
defense
document,
so
that
bond
was
opened
to
complete
cross-examination
and
moreover
the
government
could've
called
back
and
rebuttal
the
two
eyewitnesses
who
had
testified
for
them
in
direct.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
it
had
been
type
by
a
secretary
later
at
subsequent
to
the
interview.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
statement
that
was
written,
signed
or
approved
by
the
witnesses
and
that
would
be
the
situation
mr.
justice
white
i
believe
when
this
report
would
be
--
have
to
shown
into
the
witness.
this
was
a
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
if
--
yes
--
if
the
statements
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
it
would
because
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
sir.
they
could.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
your
honor,
it's
based
on
the
common
law
rules
of
evidence.
the
rule
in
a
queens's
case
which
is
followed
by
a
number
of
courts
as
i
understand
it,
i
would
require
statements
signed
by
a
witness
or
approve
by
the
witness
or
written
by
the
witness
to
be
shown
to
him
that
is
sensible,
and
that
the
witness
has
actually
seen
the
statement,
and
agreed
that
reflexes
contemporaneous
attempt
--
remarks
but
this
was
a
report
written
by
somebody
else
not
to
be
produce
to
trial
and
written
subsequent
to
the
actual
interview.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
your
honor.
we
make
three
arguments
with
regard
to
privilege.
we
think
that
any
document
like
this
is
privileged
under
adversary
system
and
its
interest
in
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
it's
always
been
held
that
confidentiality
in
the
preparation
of
a
defense
case
is
essential
to
the
further
ends
of
that.
we
have
two
privilege
arguments
that
come
under
that
confidentiality
heading.
the
one
with
sixth
amendment
one
were
product.
our
third
privilege
argument
is
based
on
the
fifth
amendment
but
aside
from
the
privilege,
we
think
this
was
simply
a
matter
of
the
court
of
appeals
exercise
in
its
supervisory
jurisdiction
to
correct
a
mistake
of
the
trial
court,
in
interpreting
those
rules
of
evidence
which
governed
disclosure
of
documents
at
trial.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
yes,
it
is
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
that's
right.
but
bond
was
my
witness
and
rule
in
the
queens
case
would
not
apply
in
a
situation
such
as
that.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
that's
right.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
no,
sir.
i
respectfully
disagree
the
rule
in
the
queens
case
is
specifically
applicable
when
the
direct
examiner
is
examining
an
opposing
parties'
witness.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
rule
in
the
queens
case
would
apply
to
me
as
the
examiner
of
the
government's
witness
that
is
i
would
have
to
turnover
statements
of
the
government
witnesses
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
--
when
i'm
cross-examining
them
but
it
would
not
apply
to
make
me
turnover
to
the
government
statements
in
my
position
when
my
own
witness
has
completed
his
testimony,
the
rule
on
the
queens
case
would
apply
to
bond
insofar
as
any
statements
of
bond
in
the
possession
of
the
government
would
have
to
be
turned
over
to
me
during
their
cross-examination
to
him
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
to
him,
yes.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
certainly.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
found
this
to
support
any
contention
that
his
recollection
was
refreshed.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
that's
correct.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
that's
true.
we've
--
i'd
like
to
make
the
copy
actually.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
perhaps
your
honor,
i
don't
think
its
necessarily
true
in
all
cases
and
if
that
if
where
you
have
the
case
of
a
very
important
trial
and
the
witness
is
just
been
interviewed
and
because
of
some
items
and
other
parts
of
the
report
not
relevant
or
not
specifically
connected
with
the
statements
he
would
testify
to
if
the
defense
counsel
didn't.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
they
wouldn't
be
turned
over
to
the
government
to
provide
it
with
information.
it
might
not
have
the
investigator
refresh
his
recollection
with
the
report.
in
any
case,
i
don't
think
that
that's
an
issue
on
this
case
because
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
if
any
finding
that
he
did
refresh
his
recollection.
the
court
of
appeals
found
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
no,
he
was
not
your
honor.
our
contention
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
--
is
that
the
rules
of
disclosure
of
documents
that
are
in
effect
at
the
time
of
trial
are
compose
of
the
common
law
rules
of
evidence,
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
and
the
jencks
act.
the
rule
16
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
sets
aside
in
the
last
sentence
a
certain
number
of
items
of
the
defense
which
are
immune
from
government
discovery.
this
document
falls
within
that
last
sentence
in
two
different
phrases
of
it.
one,
it
is
a
report
of
an
age
end
of
the
defendant.
secondly,
it
is
a
statement
of
a
government
witness
made
to
an
age
end
of
the
defendant.
now,
the
petitioner
argues
that
rule
16
is
only
applicable
pretrial.
if
one
looks
at
rule
16
(b),
the
preceding
subsection
and
at
its
last
sentence,
one
finds
that
that
subsection
carves
out
a
certain
number
of
items
belonging
to
the
government
which
cannot
be
discovered
by
the
defense.
but
the
last
phrase
is
accepting
so
far
as
provided
in
the
jencks
act.
the
jencks
act
only
comes
into
effect
at
trial
and
therefore
it's
clear
that
the
rule
makers
had
in
mind
that
rule
16
should
be
applicable
to
trial
as
well
as
free
trial.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
if
the
shirt
were
thrown
on
the
table
your
honor,
it
would
in
effect
be
produce
at
the
trial.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
report
was
never
produced
at
the
trial.
am
i
directing
myself
to
your
question?
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
your
honor
in
my
cross-examination,
i
had
the
report
or
a
copy
of
that
part
that
i
wanted
to
question
the
witness
about
so
that
i
could
make
sure
i
was
restating
the
exact
words
which
she
told
john
bond
but
it
never
been
referred
too
at
all
and
it
had
never
had
been
brought
out
before
the
jury
that
there
was
a
report
written,
never
shown
to
the
jury,
never
introduced
an
evidence.
now,
a
trial
court
judge
has
discretion
when
there
is
a
rule
to
fill
in
the
gaps
to
solve
problems
not
considered
by
the
rule
makers
or
to
interpret
text
in
a
manner
which
achieves
statutory
justice
but
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
wright
case
here
in
district
of
columbia
stated,
this
kind
of
a
rule
depending
on
one's
perspective
would
expand
or
narrow
specific
rights
and
privileges
granted
by
statute
and
rule.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
it
was.
in
the
sense
that
the
entire
report
was
ordered
produced
but
it
was
not
order
to
produce
until
the
defense
was
in
its
case.
our
contention
is
that
the
basic
principles
of
the
wright
case
do
indeed
apply
that
it
was
an
investigator's
report
in
that
case
order
discovered.
now,
rule
16
is
compatible
with
the
underlying
principle
of
our
accusatory
system
that
the
government
must
bare
the
entire
burden.
any
suggestion
that
the
government
must
have
at
least
as
good
chances
the
defendant
would
too
prevail
would
seem
to
violate
the
basic
principle
favoring
the
defendant
in
order
to
avoid
conviction
of
the
innocent.
the
other
underlying
principle
of
our
system
which
i
referred
too
earlier
which
is
involved
in
this
case
and
would
certainly
influenced
me
in
refusing
to
obey
that
court's
order,
was
the
interest
in
confidentiality
and
i
might
add
if
i
may
that
although
under
my
view
of
the
documents
they
might
not
have
damaged
in
this
specific
instance
perhaps
on
the
rebuttal
if
that
was
necessary
at
a
retrial,
if
there
were
a
hung
jury
or
a
reverse
verdict.
if
there
was
a
rule
like
this
that
had
been
made
and
followed
during
the
trial,
what
could
that
mean
in
terms
of
my
defendant
and
what
would
i
and
what
i
would
have
to
turnover
to
laid
on
the
trial
concerning
other
witnesses,
but
that
privilege
of
confidentiality
this
court
has
recognized
in
the
context
of
hickman
versus
taylor
is
essential
in
our
system
of
justice.
historically,
lawyers
have
worked
as
officers
of
the
court
to
protect
the
interest
of
their
clients.
now
the
way
that's
done,
this
court
said
in
hickman
is
with
a
certain
degree
of
privacy.
this
is
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
this
is
the
petitioner's
viewpoint
and
it's
true
that
hickman
did
deal
with
the
statement
made
to
the
attorney
as
oppose
to
an
investigator.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
your
honor,
we've
cited
down
in
our
brief
a
number
of
cases
which
say
that
hickman
does
apply
so
i
think
that
although
there
are
some
would
say
it
doesn't
apply,
there
are
that
many
that
would
say
it
does
apply.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
that's
correct,
that
is
absolutely
correct
your
honor,
i'm
just
moving
now
into
our
three
privilege
arguments.
we
basically
rest
on
the
contention
that
this
is
merely
an
exercise
of
the
court
of
appeals
supervisory
discretion
to
challenge
a
completely
new
rule
fashioned
by
a
district
court
judge
against
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
third
circuit
in
a
unanimous
embank
decision
in
hickman,
later
affirm
by
this
court
recognized
that
that
policy
of
confidentiality
is
open
to
the
jives
of
the
cenacle.
but
we
believe
it
sound;
we
know
it
is
irrefutably
established
in
the
law
although
it
is
not
capable
of
laboratory
demonstration.
only
that
principle
of
confidentiality
will
assure
that
a
defense
counsel
can
get
all
the
facts
both
favorable
and
unfavorable
which
he's
going
to
need
to
direct
what's
going
to
happen
to
case
whether
it
should
be
dispose
off
before
trial,
whether
it
should
go
to
trial,
who
should
take
the
stand
and
what
other
witnesses
should
testify.
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
it
would
be
if
he
had
refresh
his
recollection
with
the
notes
and
conceivably
it
would
be
different
if
he
in
some
way
indicated
although
i
would
argue
or
not
to
the
jury
by
waiving
the
report
and
somehow
relying
on
the
fact
that
he
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
the
confidentiality
your
honors
protects
all
internal
documents
of
the
defense
made
by
the
defense
team.
this
was
a
report
by
--
from
one
member
the
defense
team
the
investigator
to
the
attorney
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
--
from
one
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
mr.
justice
marshall,
you're
correct
in
suggesting
that
that
would
be
different
then
in
the
sense
that
it
certainly
not
a
communication
by
one
member
of
the
defense
team.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
that's
correct
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
i
think
that
it
certainly
would
be
much
more
arguable
that
something
like
that
could
be
produce
for
two
reasons.
one,
it's
a
scientific
kind
of
a
statement,
and
number
two,
it's
not
a
criminal
case.
i
think
that
there
are
extra
reasons
in
a
criminal
case
which
protect
documents.
and
thirdly
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
your
honor,
we'd
contend
that.
in
addition,
an
attorney
for
a
criminal
defendant
is
really
a
close
agent
really
in
extension
of
a
defendant.
there
is
much
closer
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
yes,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
i
would
certainly
prefer
that
that
it's
my
normal
practice
to
have
the
investigator
get
a
written
statement
signed
by
the
witness
or
approved
by
him
then
it's
much
more
effective
in
examining
the
witness.
but
i
think
that
the
problems
of
a
defendant
interviewing
government
witness'
is
illustrated
by
this
case.
here
the
most
important
government
witness
refused
to
meet
with
the
investigator.
finally,
agreed
to
talk
on
the
telephone
and
the
report
was
made
subsequent
to
that
conversation
on
the
telephone.
there's
a
great
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
hoffman.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
your
honor,
bank
teller
after
a
bank
robbery
in
my
experience
tends
to
be
a
prejudice
against
the
defendant
assuming
that
the
government's
right
in
bringing
the
man
in
the
trial.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
i
beg
your
pardon,
prejudice
against
the
robber.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
that's
correct.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
government
witnesses
too
often
assume
that
the
government
is
right
and
the
man
they
have
and
therefore
are
immediately
prejudice
against
that
man.
that's
been
one
of
the
problems
in
really
seeing
that
our
adversary
system
works.
in
other
words,
the
adversary
system
presupposes
the
erratically
two
equally
strong
sides.
that's
not
been
true.
this
court
in
wardius
versus
oregon
recognizes
that
the
government
has
special
advantages
in
investigating
the
case,
but
beyond
that,
there's
been
a
problem
with
effect
to
the
systems
of
counsel
for
defendants.
the
relationship
of
trust
and
confidence
between
a
client
and
his
defendant
which
the
aba
has
recognized
as
the
cornerstone
of
the
criminal
justice
system
and
something
particularly
hard
to
achieve
in
criminal
as
oppose
to
civil
cases.
it's
going
to
be
affected
we
contend,
once
the
defendant
sees
his
counsel
giving
to
the
government
material
conceivably
favorable
to
the
government.
the
literature
as
we
plead
of
course
with
instances
of
defendants
not
trusting
their
public
defenders
thinking
that
those
defendants
are
--
those
counsels
are
just
another
arm
of
the
government.
so,
the
problem
of
trust
and
confidence
is
even
greater
because
of
that,
excuse
me.
the
other
problem
with
confidentiality
is
of
course
that
outline
of
hickman,
the
problem
of
the
investigators
not
investigating
this
thoroughly,
not
--
perhaps
not
writing
reports
at
all.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
in
my
understanding
mr.
justice
white,
your
question
as
assuming
a
situation
where
the
report
has
been
shown
to
the
jury
although
not
actually
verdict
that
referred
to
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
and
he's
looking
at
the
report?
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
certainly
that
report
should
be
turned
over
to
the
government
because
he's
refreshing
his
recollection
with
it.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
the
--
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
refreshing
recollection
doctrine
has
traditionally
been
a
matter
of
common
law
trial
practice
and
has
therefore
been
an
exception
to
any
privilege
argument.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
i
think
it's
a
question
of
waiver
perhaps.
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
absolutely
not
if
there's
a
specific
--
mr.
nicholas
r.
allis
your
honor,
our
contention
is
that
the
common
law
rules
of
evidence
of
which
the
rule
refreshing
recollection
is
one
are
complimentary
to
rule
16
if
there's
a
rule
of
the
common
law
evidence
specifically
making
an
exception
to
rule
16
then
it
should
be
followed,
but
here
there
is
no
specific
rule.
there
is
no
rule
of
evidence
which
would
either
authorize
--
which
would
authorize
the
government
to
produce
this
under
any
circumstances
--
would
authorize
the
government
to
get
hold
of
it
under
any
circumstances.
thank
you.
