justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question
i'm
sure
i
don't
understand
the
postural
case
but
if
the
statements
in
the
possession
of
your
witness
corroborated
his
testimony,
why
did
you
object
to
that
being
presented
to
the
jury?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
even
when
the
defense
opens
up
the
subject
on
cross-examination?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
this
report
in
bond's
handwriting
or
had
it
been
typed
by
his
typewriter?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
your
position
here
today
be
different
if
you
would
had
in
your
possession
statements
signed
by
the
prosecution
witnesses
that
had
been
referred
to
in
cross-examination?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
would
be
different?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
agree
that
those
statements
could
be
demanded
by
the
trial
court?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
tell
me
again
why
draw
to
this
--
the
distinction
between
our
statements
signed
by
a
witness
and
the
recordation
of
the
witness
statement
by
your
investigator.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
is
what
product?
the
lawyer's
what
product?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

mr.
allis,
what
do
you
normally
do,
i'm
not
talking
about
you
personally
but
what
the
defense
counsel
normally
do,
when
they
send
an
investigator
out.
do
they
prefer
to
have
him
obtain
statements
from
witnesses
which
is,
what
is
customarily
done
in
the
civil
practice,
statements
that
are
signed
by
witnesses
and
that
can
be
use
effectively
to
cross-examine
witnesses
or
do
you
instruct
your
investigators
never
to
take
a
statement
that
cost
the
statement
might
be
used
against
them.
but
the
investigator
should
write
up
his
own
report
which
under
your
submission
here
today
can
never
be
use
against
them.
what
is
a
normal
practice?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
many
cases,
you
have
no
idea
whether
the
witness
is
going
to
be
pro-government
or
pro-defense
or
just
as
neutral
as
he
can
be?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
second
case
which
is
74-634,
u.s.
against
nobles,
we
have
a
case
that
came
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
an
investigator
for
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
obtained
prior
to
trial
a
statement
from
a
prosecution
witness.
the
witness
was
cross-examined
by
defense
counsel
on
a
subject
matter
of
this
statement.
thereafter
and
for
impeachment
purposes,
the
defense
called
in
the
investigator
to
testify
as
to
his
interview
with
the
prosecution
witness.
defense
counsel
advised
the
court,
however,
that
he
would
not
produce
the
written
statement.
the
court
of
appeals
reversing
the
district
court
held
that
both
the
fifth
amendment
and
federal
criminal
procedure
rule
16
protected
the
statement
from
compelled
disclosure.
we
take
a
different
view.
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
being
personal
to
the
defendant
does
not
extend
to
the
statement
of
a
third-party
witness
nor
does
rule
16
authorize
a
different
result
as
it
relates
only
to
pretrial
discovery.
defendant
also
asserted
a
work
product
privilege,
but
even
if
that
privilege
would
have
been
available
it
was
waived
by
defendant
when
he
elected
to
make
testimonial
use
of
the
statement.
accordingly,
we
--
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
white
joined
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
he
agreed
with
the
judgment
and
joined
in
parts,
ii,
iii
and
v
of
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
justice
douglas
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
