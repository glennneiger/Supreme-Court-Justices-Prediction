justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
refer
to
it
as
ordering
a
defendant
to
do
it
mr.
freidman?
couldn't
that
order
be
directed
to
the
witness
himself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court's
restriction
on
bond's
testimony
permit
him
to
testify
as
to
the
lighting
in
the
bank
without
showing
the
report?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
see
the
scope
of
the
trial
judges
order
here
requiring
a
turnover
as
being
necessarily
tantamount
to
allowing
the
prosecution
to
offer
this
in
our
inhabit
admitted
in
evidence?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
would
think
it
is
not
precisely
the
same
for
the
trial
court
to
say,
“you
must
make
available
to
the
prosecutor
this
document.”
and
to
say,
“i
order
this
document
and
admit
it
in
evidences
exhibit
so
on
and
so.”
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
protect
it
from
discovery
in
the
civil
action
by
hickman
against
taylor,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean
by
justice
blackmun's
hypothesis
that
where
the
lawyer
himself
id
the
interview
and
then
it's
clearly
protected
from
pretrial
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
this
panel
set
in
that
the
panel
i'm
sure
it's
set
in
san
francisco
or
los
angeles.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
rule
of
the
queens
case
is
a
rule
governing
cross-examination,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
followed
some
places
and
not
others?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
weren't
required
to
produce
that
until
the
prosecution
was
going
to
examine
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
--
there
it's
a
clear
case
of
the
queens
case
rule.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
confused
in
terms.
what
do
you
mean
by
a
direct
examiner?
examining
an
opposing
parties'
witness?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
direct
examination
and
there's
a
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you're
going
to
cross-examine
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
him
rather
than
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
on
cross-examination,
you
would
ask
the
government's
witness
whether
they
were
aware
of
a
bloody
shirt
that
had
been
found
in
connection
with
this
thing
and
their
answer
was
“no”.
and
then,
your
investigator
sitting
at
counsel
table
waiting
to
be
called
as
a
witness
simply
pulls
a
bloody
shirt
out
of
his
pocket
and
puts
it
in
front
upon
the
table
in
full
view
at
the
jury.
is
it
your
position
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
find
some
justification,
one
of
these
rules
of
evidence
in
order
to
order
that
shirt
at
least
brought
before
the
court
for
inspection
to
see
what
light
it
would
shed
on
the
trial?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
certainly
are.
is
there
no
evidence
then
that
either
you
in
your
clause
of
evidence
suggested
that
there
had
been
a
report
either
by
looking
at
it
or
otherwise?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
judge
pratt's
order
in
the
wright
case
was
a
good
deal
broader
than
the
district
court's
order
here,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
hickman
wouldn't
protect
the
statement
made
to
an
investigating
agent
would
it
as
oppose
to
the
statement
made
to
a
lawyer
and
mr.
justice
blackmun's
hypothetical?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
a
lot
of
district
court
law
that
says
that
statements
for
investigators
are
not
protected
under
hickman.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
i'm
representing
a
condemnee,
and
i
employ
an
appraiser
and
he
makes
a
report
to
me
as
the
value
of
the
property.
can
i
say
that
he's
one
of
the
condemnee's
team
and
therefore
the
report
is
not
discoverable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
be
wrong
on
hickman
and
still
prevail
because
this
is
a
criminal
case
i
did?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
think
an
attorney
for
a
condemnee
is
a
pretty
much
of
close
agent
too?
