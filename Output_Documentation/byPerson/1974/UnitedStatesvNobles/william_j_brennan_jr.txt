justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
same
in
jencks
act
limitation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
ordinary
jencks
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that
and
i
gather
practices
growing
upturning
over
so
according
to
jencks
statements
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
defense
counsel
before
the
trial
begins.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
under
the
statute
itself,
there
not
obligation
to
turn
anything
or
run
in
the
part
of
the
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
until
the
witnesses
completed
his
direct
testimony,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
wondering
is
if
you
had
a
jencks
act
situation.
a
judge
couldn't
say
i'll
let
you
testify
anything
you
promise
with
the
government.
now,
it
tells
me
not
going
to
tend
it
over,
wouldn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
it
doesn't
happen,
i'm
just
wondering
whether
the
judge
would
have
that
authority.
the
prosecutor
did
say
i'm
not
going
to
do
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
certainly,
out
of
the
jencks
opinion
what
would
have
happened
as
you'd
have
to
dismiss
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
some
point,
would
you
tell
me
why
we
should
decide
this
case
when
613
(a)
is
going
to
become
effective
on
july
1?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
this
will
survive
613
(a),
will
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
otherwise
i
don't
see
that
this
just
be
a
decision
from
this
case
we
wouldn't
be
settling
in
a
major
question
of
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
will
be
an
issue
under
613
(a)
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
what
you'd
just
said
mr.
freidman.
i
really
have
trouble
saying
what
anyone
gains
by
our
side
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
jencks
case
was
not
a
constitutional
decision.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
distinguishing
the
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
could
you
decide
that
your
hypothetical
--
how
could
he
decide
other
than
then
it
was
relevant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
wouldn't
ask
on
cross-examination
whether
he
had
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
at
all?
