justice
thurgood

and
how
about
in
this
verdict
case
if
a
man
walks
in
off

and
tells
a
lawyer
that
i
heard
so
on
and
so
say
this
not
took
some
notes
on
it,
and
he
calls
him
as
a
witness,
same
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
comes
in
that
the
lawyer
didn't
know
a
thing
about
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
use
your
phrase
seeking
the
truth.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
say,
assuming
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
with
the
rule
applied,
it
is
the
man
to
walk
in
out
of
the
street?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now
the
lawyer
will
walk
into
the
courtroom
and
volunteered
himself
as
a
witness.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
and
the
judge
called
him
as
a
witness.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
you're
doing
if
you
try
to
get
this
case
reverse
so
you
can
put
the
new
rule
on
and
then
never
to
do
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
allis,
what
would
you
do
if
the
witness
had
the
notes
in
his
own
pocket
while
he's
up
to
testify?
would
that
be
a
little
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
you
get
your
confidentiality
award,
he
has
in
his
pocket.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
my
case,
well
he
got
some
notes
in
his
pocket.
i
don't
know
what
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
wouldn't
be
necessarily
a
working
product
but
it
could
be
made
it
like
you
take
position
if
it's
in
your
hands
it's
obviously
a
working
product.
is
that
--?
