justice
byron
r.
white
was
he
about
to
use
those
reports?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
defense
investigator
who
was
going
to
impeach
the
government
witnesses.
justice
byron
r.
white
won't
--
if
it
weren't
shown
under
the
new
rules
of
evidence
when
they
go
into
affect,
if
that
weren't
shown,
you
wouldn't
get
these?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
put
it
this
way,
there's
a
problem
--
then
you'd
have
a
problem
on
the
rules
would
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
whether
you
can
solve
or
not
is
another
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
one
of
these
days,
you'll
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
not
affect
till
july?
justice
byron
r.
white
more
than
jencks.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
get
--
under
jencks,
you
don't
get
it
until
a
fellow
has
testified.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
other
way
that
matters
in
having
to
testify
in
order
to
turn
it
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
are
you
concentrating
on
--
apparently
you're
saying
it
to
be
just
because
they
were
going
to
put
the
defense
investigator
on
that
who
were
entitled
to
have
his
notes
of
the
--
of
his
interviews
with
the
government
witnesses.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
object
to
defense
cross-examination
of
the
defense
witnesses
at
that
time
about
their
prior
statements
without
the
defense
giving
you
a
copy
of
any
notes
they
made
of
their
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
there
a
rule
--
a
common
rule
of
evidence
that
if
you're
going
to
cross-examine
a
witness
about
a
prior
statement
of
his
especially
took
were
written
that
you're
supposed
to
show
it
to
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when
the
government
witnesses
were
being
cross-examined,
did
you
ask
for
them
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
are
retrial
and
the
rules
were
in
a
effect
and
they
apply,
let's
assume
they
apply,
you
would
demand
these
statements
i've
taken
under
613
at
the
time
of
the
cross-examination.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you're
concentrating
--
if
you
were
just
concentrating
on
getting
the
documents
because
the
defense
investigator
is
go
on
the
stand,
then
you'd
face
with
rule
612.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you're
right
on
your
rule
16
argument,
it's
irrelevant.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
bond
is
down
the
stand
and
you
were
asking
the
questions
that
would
impeach
the
government
witnesses
by
saying
that
they
did
tell
him
so
and
so.
and
bond
had
a
piece
of
paper
in
his
hand
and
he
was
looking
at
it.
now,
would
you
show
that
--
would
you
say
you
could
show
that
you
would
have
to
show
that
to
government
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
referred
to
the
jury
at
all.
your
man
is
on
the
stand
and
you're
asking
him
the
questions
that
you
think
will
impeach
the
government
witness.
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
looking
at
a
piece
of
paper.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
difference
does
that
make
in
terms
of
your
privileges?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
you
think,
rule
16
doesn't
forbid
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
the
same
piece
of
paper
that
you
say
rule
16
would
protect
you
from
producing
it
if
you
weren't
looking
at
it,
at
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
pillars,
have
you
--
you
still
insisting
that
it's
quite
all
right
to
keep
the
witness
off
the
stand
entirely
rather
than
letting
him
testify
and
then
demanding
that
you
get
the
statement
and
having
the
court
order
them
to
produce
it?
