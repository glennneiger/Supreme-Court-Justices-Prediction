ms.
lila
j.
young
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
mrs.
young,
attorney
for
the
petitioners,
the
indianapolis
school
board
in
this
case.
the
plaintiffs
were
high
schools
students
in
the
indianapolis
public
schools,
all
minors
and
they
filed
a
class
action
for
a
declaratory
injunctive
relief
as
well
as
damages
against
the
indianapolis
school
board
because
school
authorities
said
they
could
neither
distribute
nor
sell
in
the
indianapolis
schools
a
newspaper
entitled
the
corn
cob
curtain.
we
had
two
board
rules
at
that
time,
both
requiring
prior
approval
for
sales
and
for
distribution
of
literature
at
school.
approval
was
not
given
for
the
sale
or
distributions
of
the
corn
cob
curtain
because
it
contained
defamatory,
obscene
language.
this
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
there
have
been
--
yes,
no
it
was
not
the
first
issue.
there
had
been
several
issues
distributed
both
in
and
outside
of
the
school.
actually
not
very
many
copies
had
been
distributed
inside
any
of
the
high
schools.
there
were
two
high
schools
at
which
some
distribution
had
taken
place.
at
that
time
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
there
were
five
issues
over
a
period
of
the
little
over
four
months.
ms.
lila
j.
young
by
the
superintendent,
that's
correct.
ms.
lila
j.
young
well,
there
had
been
some
discussion
with
the
administrators
and
they
got
--
the
high
school
administrators,
they
got
together
with
the
superintendent
and
at
that
time
he
asked
for
copies
and
said
that
it
contained
obscene
language
and
he
could
not
give
approval
to
distribution
on
this
in
a
--
of
this
in
the
school
because
he
felt
it
was
the
duty
of
the
school
officials
to
discourage
and
prevent
the
use
of
this
language
by
children
in
school.
ms.
lila
j.
young
no,
it
is
not.
ms.
lila
j.
young
shortly
after
the
decision
in
this
case.
there
were
a
few
copies
distributed
at
a
couple
of
high
schools
or
outside
of
those
high
schools
after
the
decision
but
the
corn
cub
curtain
is
no
longer
an
existence.
were
any
penalties
imposed
on
the
plaintiffs?
ms.
lila
j.
young
absolutely
none.
ms.
lila
j.
young
well,
the
interest
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
there's
a
quite
a
bit
alive
in
this
case.
we
have
submitted
several
sets
of
rules
to
the
court,
to
the
district
court.
first
of
all,
we
amended
our
original
rules
of
prior
restraint.
these
rules
are
no
longer
in
existence,
but
the
first
amendment
of
our
rule
added
procedural
and
substantive
safeguards
to
these
rules
but
the
district
court
said
he
could
not
give
any
approval
to
any
form
of
prior
restraint.
so
at
that
time
he
ordered
to
us
again
amend
our
rules
which
we
did.
our
second
amendment
of
our
rules
contained
only
subsequent
restraints
and
we
had
quite
a
few
of
those.
the
district
court
also
declared
those
facially
unconstitutional.
he
entered
a
permanent
injunction
against
us
as
well
as
declaring
these
rules
facially
unconstitutional
and
this
injunction
was
upheld
in
its
entirety
by
the
seventh
circuit,
so
we
have
a
permanent
injunction
against
us.
we
also
have
a
complete
inability
to
have
any
rules
or
regulations
of
what
is
going
to
be
distributed
in
our
school,
so
this
issue
is
very
much
alive
even
though
the
corn
cob
curtain
as
a
particular
newspaper
is
no
longer
an
existence.
ms.
lila
j.
young
i
think
virtually
all
of
them
have
of
this
particular
paper.
ms.
lila
j.
young
there
are
basically
five
issues
presented
to
this
court
today.
one
is
the
validity
of
our
rules
of
prior
restraint,
the
rules
adding
the
substantive
and
procedural
safeguards
that
were
suggested
by
the
other
circuits
which
had
approved
the
principle
of
prior
review
of
student
literature
prior
to
its
distribution
in
school.
two
of
the
issues
concern
the
validity
of
our
rules
of
subsequent
restraint
and
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erroneously
applied
principles
in
declaring
these
rules
facially
void.
our
fourth
issue
is
whether
the
district
court
erred
in
his
complete
refusal
to
apply
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedures
17
(c)
simply
because
the
infant
plaintiffs
in
this
case
had
raised
a
constitutional
issue
so
he
totally
ignored
the
mandate
of
that
rule.
the
fifth
issue
which
i
plan
to
emphasize
here
today
is
whether
elementary
and
high
schools
can
either
prevent
or
discipline
students
who
use
gutter
language
in
our
elementary
and
high
schools.
since
we
all
know
what
these
words
are
and
they're
printed
in
the
appendix,
i
would
prefer
not
to
repeat
them
here
today.
they
involve
more
than
words,
they
involved
phrases
and
filthy
cartoons.
now,
it's
your
decision
whether
or
not
children
will
be
using
gutter
language
in
our
elementary
and
high
schools.
if
you
decide
that
school
officials
can
neither
prevent
nor
discipline
students
who
use
this
language
in
school,
then
many
basic
functions
of
our
schools
will
be
destroyed.
one
of
these
basic
functions
is
to
teach
children
how
to
use
language
properly
and
in
socially
acceptable
terms.
now,
this
cannot
be
taught
in
our
schools
and
it
will
not
be
taught.
if
you
decide
that
the
school
officials
can
do
nothing
about
it
and
if
the
students
in
our
school
say,
“we'll,
it's
okay
for
us
to
write
and
distribute
this
language
because
the
supreme
court
says
its
fine.”
now,
a
lot
of
time
could
be
spent
discussing
what
label
we
might
attach
to
these
words
whether
they
should
be
classified
as
legally
obscene
as
to
minors
or
as
indecent.
but
the
classification
or
label
attached
to
this
filth
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
it
belongs
in
the
gutter
and
not
in
our
school
houses.
now,
it's
either
right
or
wrong
for
children
to
be
using
and
distributing
this
language
in
our
schools
and
if
it's
wrong
then
our
school
officials
should
be
able
to
do
something
about
it.
it
seems
incredible
that
the
right
to
control
the
use
of
this
language
in
our
schools
should
even
be
questioned,
let
alone
denied.
our
briefs
discussed
many
harmful
consequences
of
allowing
this
type
of
language
to
be
spread
throughout
our
elementary
and
high
schools.
ms.
lila
j.
young
no,
it
definitely
involves
elementary
schools.
our
rules
definitely
cover
all
the
indianapolis
public
schools
and
there
are
some
114
elementary
schools
as
well
as
11
high
schools.
now,
the
plaintiffs
were
high
school
students.
two
of
them
--
before
the
action
had
been
commenced,
before
the
compliant
was
filed
had
actually
graduated
but
they
were
high
schools
students.
they
had
actually
distributed
only
in
two
or
around
two
high
schools
but
the
injunction
covers
and
clearly
covers
the
elementary
schools.
the
rules
clearly
cover
the
elementary
schools.
our
briefs
and
everything
covers
the
elementary
schools.
we
don't
have
separate
rules
for
grade
schools
children
and
high
school
children.
ms.
lila
j.
young
at
no
time
did
they
deny
that
these
rules
in
the
case
involved
only
high
schools
until
we
got
up
to
the
seventh
circuit
and
there
in
response
to
a
question
by
one
of
the
justices
they
stated,
“these
rules
apply
only
to
high
schools.”
but
they
do
not
and
the
court's
opinion,
the
district
court's
opinion
clearly
is
applicable
as
well
as
the
injunction
is
applicable
to
grade
school
student.
also
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
that's
correct.
however,
since
the
injunction
was
upheld
in
it's
entirety
it's
very
clear
that
we
cannot
apply
these
rules
to
elementary
students.
the
rules
were
declared
facially
void,
null
and
void.
it
would
be
bad
faith
for
us
to
say,
well
even
though
they
specifically
covered
all
the
schools
that
we
can
go
now
and
apply
them
to
the
grade
schools.
ms.
lila
j.
young
i
doubt
that
because
if
you
look
even
in
that
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
they
claimed
that
for
the
first
time
at
the
oral
argument
but
they
never
claimed
it
and
they
never
denied
the
fact
that
elementary
students
were
involved
when
we
were
down
in
the
lower
courts.
ms.
lila
j.
young
i'm
certain
they
will
probably
claim
it
here.
ms.
lila
j.
young
right.
but
if
you
look
at
the
transcript
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
i
would
disagree
with
that
because
they
have
many
references
to
elementary
schools,
their
very
complaint.
ms.
lila
j.
young
the
impression
that
the
claim
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
well,
i
don't
believe
that
they
claimed
that
the
injunction
--
i
don't
think
that
they
claiming
that
the
injunction
or
the
rules
apply
only
to
or
govern
only
high
schools.
i
think
their
argument
basically
is
that
the
class
was
consisted
only
of
high
school
students
but
the
students
made
it
clear
right
in
the
evidentiary
hearing
that
they
planned
to
distribute
this
newspaper
not
only
to
high
school
student
but
to
anyone
else
and
the
relief
sought
was
not
confined
only
to
high
schools.
ms.
lila
j.
young
they
are
--
who
are
remaining
plaintiffs?
ms.
lila
j.
young
right.
there
were
six
named
plaintiffs.
only
two
remained
at
the
end
of
the
case
because
the
rest
had
graduated.
ms.
lila
j.
young
i'm
not
completely
sure
but
i
think
that's
probably
true.
ms.
lila
j.
young
yes.
ms.
lila
j.
young
the
class
was
the
high
schools
students
in
the
indianapolis
public
schools,
but
the
relief
sought
governed
more
than
the
high
schools
students.
it
involved
our
suppression
of
distribution
anywhere
in
the
indianapolis
public
schools.
as
i
said
the
issue
i
wish
to
emphasize
here
today
is
the
issue
on
the
type
of
language
and
the
basic
reason
for
suppressing
this
distribution.
if
this
court
decides
that
minors
may
not
be
disciplined
for
using
this
language
in
school,
how
can
it
consistently
justify
its
own
rules
and
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
permit
adult
attorneys
to
be
disciplined
for
inserting
scandalous
and
indecent
material
in
their
briefs
and
pleadings.
surely
the
school
officials
have
as
much
right
to
maintain
a
basic
level
of
decency
and
a
proper
atmosphere
in
our
school
so
that
learning
can
take
place.
an
academic
atmosphere
is
no
less
important
in
our
schools
than
it
is
in
our
courts
and
if
respect
and
decency
is
destroyed
in
our
school
then
it
won't
last
much
longer
in
the
courtroom
or
anywhere
else.
in
balancing
the
public
interest
or
the
students'
interest
in
expression
against
the
many
harmful
consequences
that
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
and
the
justifications
for
the
regulation
of
this
type
of
filth
in
our
schools,
i
think
the
scales
are
very
unevenly
balanced.
in
fact,
what
possible
value
or
benefit
could
be
derived
by
permitting
children
to
use
and
distribute
this
type
of
four
letter
words
and
filth
in
our
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
respondents
argue
that
not
every
article
is
filthy
and
that
the
words
are
not
used
too
many
times,
but
if
the
number
of
times
obscenities
are
used
is
to
be
the
criterion
for
regulation
in
the
school
house,
then
this
would
be
in
effect
telling
children
that
it's
okay
to
use
these
words
just
so
long
as
you
don't
use
them
too
many
times.
ms.
lila
j.
young
well,
i
think
there
are
two
ways
of
approaching
this.
we
originally
approached
it
and
would
like
to
still
continue
to
approach
it
with
a
prior
review
of
student
literature
in
order
to
take
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
the
procedures
are
set
out
in
our
rule
of
prior
review.
they
would
submit
material
that
they
desire
to
have
a
general
distribution
of
in
the
school
house.
we
have
procedural
safeguards
set
out
and
criterion
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
that's
--
that
would
be
correct,
each
issue,
and
if
filth
and
four
letter
words
were
used
in
the
publication
then
the
school
officials
would
say
that
they
do
not
think
this
is
proper
language
to
use
and
they
would
not
allow
the
distribution
unless
that
language
would
be
removed,
that's
the
issue
of
prior
restraint
and
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
there
would
be
no
regulation.
ms.
lila
j.
young
the
rule
specifically
provides
for
allowing
responsible
criticism,
it's
stated
right
in
the
rules.
ms.
lila
j.
young
well,
responsible
criticism
would
be
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
who
decides
it?
well,
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
the
--a
board
or
review
that
would
be
setup
to
look
at
this
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
who
might
be
criticized
himself,
that's
correct.
our
schools
are
not
opposed
to
criticism.
they
see
--
receive
a
great
deal
of
it
and
i
think
they'd
receive
a
great
deal
more
if
they
didn't
have
any
rules
or
control
over
the
conduct
of
students
in
their
schools.
ms.
lila
j.
young
that
is
called
for
in
our
rules
of
subsequent
restraint
which
allow
only
subsequent
punishment
after
the
fact.
ms.
lila
j.
young
right,
we
have
two
set
of
rules.
we
would
prefer
a
prior
approval.
ms.
lila
j.
young
i
think
we
are
entitled
to
both
sets
of
rules
as
they
have
been
written.
ms.
lila
j.
young
i
don't
think
it
is
ineffective,
i
think
it
is
less
effective.
we
aren't
interested
in
punishing
students.
we
don't
like
to
remove
them
from
the
schools.
we're
interested
in
teaching
them
to
speak
in
socially
acceptable
terms
and
a
newspaper
that
they
would
wish
to
print
could
be
a
good
learning
experience,
but
i
think
there
has
to
be
certain
controls.
we
just
like
to
take
a
peak
at
it
and
see
what's
coming
in
to
our
schools.
if
we
can't
do
that
then
we
would
like
to
impose
subsequent
restraints
because
that's
all
its
left
to
us.
the
subsequent
restraints
would
not
necessarily
be
expulsion.
they
range
from
a
reprimand
to
expulsion
which
is
the
last
resort.
we
don't
use
expulsion.
that
often
we
try
every
other
means
first.
but
we
would
like
to
avoid
punishment
and
i
think
a
prior
review
would
set
up
more
a
learning
experience
rather
than
waiting
and
saying
distribute
it
and
see
what
the
consequences
are.
ms.
lila
j.
young
i
think
this
is
more
important
for
the
rules
of
subsequent
restraint.
i
think
it
is
absolutely
essential
in
that
area
because
that
is
the
only
means
for
determining
who
is
abusing
the
system.
if
articles
are
sent
in
to
a
post
office
boxes,
they
were
in
the
corn
cob
curtain
and
they'll
print
whatever
they
--
was
sent
into
them
with
absolutely
no
editing,
we
must
assume
that
they
would
allow
pornography
or
anything
else
that
was
sent
in.
ms.
lila
j.
young
i
don't
believe
in
our
rule
of
prior
restraint
that
we
limit
it.
we
do
on
the
anonymous
part,
but
we
would
prefer
a
student
newspaper
in
either
situation
be
written
by
a
student
simply
because
outsiders
have
no
right
to
come
in
to
the
school
and
distribute
their
wares
and
literature
and
we
do
not
wish
this
basic
principle
to
be
subverted
by
having
children
distribute
it
for
them.
the
school
is
a
place
where
many
children
are
forced
to
attend.
it
constitutes
a
large
captive
audience.
there
are
many
outsiders
that
are
interested
in
reaching
this
captive
audience.
this
is
a
serious
problem
not
only
with
salesman
but
with
anybody
who
want
to
reach
the
thousands
of
students
in
the
school.
at
tech
high
school
one
of
the
student
--
one
of
the
schools
involved
in
this
case,
we
have
over
five
thousands
students.
this
is
quite
a
vulnerable
captive
audience.
so
this
is
why
we
wish
to
have
the
school
use
only
for
the
purpose
for
educational
purposes
and
not
for
non-school
purposes.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
lila
j.
young
i
have
ten
minutes,
i
believe.
no
time?
ms.
lila
j.
young
thank
you.
first
of
all
the
validity
of
the
rules
on
obscenity
are
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
issue
is
whether
--
first
of
all,
this
type
of
language
is
obscene
as
to
minors
and
even
if
it
could
not
be
declared
legally
obscene
as
to
minors,
whether
we
have
a
right
to
do
anything
about
it
and
we
have
rules
concerning
indecent
language
both
prior
to
restraint
rules
and
subsequent
restraint
rules,
we've
always
had
them.
also
we
have
a
juvenile
delinquent
statute
which
defines
a
juvenile
delinquent
as
one
who
uses
vulgar,
obscene,
indecent
language.
we
also
have
statutes
that
--
so
you
cannot
contribute
to
the
delinquency
of
a
minor
and
if
we
have
to
set
aside
a
time
and
place
in
our
schools
for
the
distribution
of
this
filth,
then
we
are
contributing
to
the
delinquency
of
minors.
also,
we
have
compulsory
education
under
statutes
until
age
16
in
indiana.
you
don't
have
any
choice
about
that,
that
is
clear.
also,
the
ages
of
students
in
our
high
school
is
14
to
17,
14,
15,
16
and
17,
those
are
the
normal
ages
of
high
school
students.
ms.
lila
j.
young
that's
right
and
this
is
we
may
have
one
13
and
we
may
have
a
few
who
fail
who
reached
20.
but
this
injunction
prohibits
us
from
promulgating
rules
for
instance
that
threaten
any
discipline
against
any
student
in
any
school
in
indianapolis
because
of
the
reaction
of
any
other
student
to
the
material.
it
just
totally
wipes
out
our
ability
to
control
any
kind
of
disruption.
our
disruption
rule
was
declared
facially
void
and
so
we're
left
really
with
nothing
here
and
i
might
point
out
too
that
we
do
not
have
any
double
standard
in
our
schools.
we
do
not
have
any
of
these
four
letter
words
in
the
catcher
in
the
rye
and
books
of
that
nature
either
as
required
reading
in
the
classroom
or
in
any
of
our
school
libraries
and
i
submit
that
respondents
introduce
not
one
shred
of
evidence
to
show
that
any
of
these
books
could
be
found
in
any
of
our
schools.
they
did
talk
about
the
catcher
in
the
rye
but
it
was
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
what?
ms.
lila
j.
young
well
we
don't
--
it's
not
a
matter
of
keeping
them
out
but
we
don't
have
required
reading.
we
do
choose
books
for
lessons.
ms.
lila
j.
young
all
i'm
saying
though
is
that
no
double
standard
exists
in
our
schools
which
they
were
saying
and
i
don't
think
it's
hypocritical
to
shield
children
from
exposure
to
this
language
in
school
simply
because
other
people
use
it.
this
argument
would
imply
that
everybody
has
to
be
reduced
to
the
lowest
common
denominator
anyway.
it
could
be
used
also
to
justify
any
kind
of
misconduct
and
i
don't
think
we
should
have
to
list
a
bunch
of
four
letter
words.
i
think
that's
a
little
suggestive
for
children
to
try
to
list
exactly
what
they
can
and
can't
say.
i
think
we
have
to
teach
basic
levels
of
decency
and
i
think
we
have
to
have
a
little
bit
of
trust
and
faith
in
our
school
administrators
who
deal
with
children
everyday
year
after
year.
they
have
expertise.
they
should
be
able
to
teach
what
is
right
and
wrong
and
they
can't
teach
it
if
they
can't
have
any
control
over
it.
it
would
be
hypocritical
and
inconsistent
to
try
to
preach
one
thing
in
the
classroom
while
the
children
are
out
in
the
halls
distributing
this
type
of
language
and
the
children
would
recognize
this
inconsistency
too.
i
think
there
are
three
crucial
factors
involving
all
of
these
issues
that
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
when
you
make
this
decisions.
first
of
all,
we
are
dealing
with
children.
we're
not
dealing
with
adults
and
for
a
good
reason,
the
law,
all
facets
of
the
law
have
always
been
applied
differently
to
children.
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
this
fact.
also
the
second
crucial
factor
is
that
we
are
not
concerned
with
any
regulation
of
conduct
in
the
community
at
large,
but
only
in
the
school
house,
in
the
elementary
and
high
schools.
these
factors,
you
cannot
equate
the
community
at
large
to
our
elementary
and
high
schools.
the
physically
confining
nature,
the
purposes
and
the
needs
of
the
school,
the
fact
that
children
are
required
to
attend
all
of
these
circumstances
dictate
far
different
regulations,
regulations
which
might
not
be
acceptable
in
the
community
at
large
but
they
are
very
necessary
in
order
to
provide
an
atmosphere
so
that
learning
can
take
place
in
our
schools
and
that's
the
purpose
of
our
schools,
to
teach
and
they
can't
teach
unless
they
have
rules.
also,
the
third
basic
factor
that
underlies
all
of
these
rules
and
issues
is
that
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
criminal
statutes.
there
are
no
criminal
penalties
here
attached.
students
cannot
be
fined,
they
cannot
be
imprisoned,
they
cannot
be
subjected
to
probationary
supervision.
they
cannot
be
disenfranchised.
they
can
be
subjected
only
to
mild
disciplinary
majors
and
i
submit
this
is
a
fundamental
difference.
we
are
not
here
defining
crimes.
we're
defining
what
proper
conduct
in
the
school
house,
not
beyond
the
school
house
gates,
we
have
no
regulations
concerning
that.
so
i
question
the
relevancy
of
many
of
these
cases
that
concern
the
community
at
large
and
also
concern
criminal
matters.
we
shouldn't
have
to
spend
the
time
going
down
elements
and
having
hearings
and
everything
because
we
have
an
inherent
responsibility
to
provide
an
atmosphere
where
you
have
all
these
children
grouped
together,
not
by
choice
and
i
think
the
parents
have
something
to
say
about
this
too.
they
expect
generally
accepted
standards
to
be
adhered
to
by
their
children
in
the
schools
and
i
think
the
state
has
a
basic
fundamental
interest
in
requiring
them
to
adhere
to
these
acceptable
standards
of
conduct
because
if
they
aren't
going
to
be
taught
in
schools,
where
are
they
going
to
be
taught
at?
ms.
lila
j.
young
basically
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
yes.
ms.
lila
j.
young
that's
right
and
many
of
them
of
course
would
apply
on
the
campus
which
in
the
city
school
amounts
to
very
little.
ms.
lila
j.
young
but
i
want
to
mention
too
about
sales
and
solicitations,
that's
a
very
important
issue
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
we've
listed
so
many
reasons
in
our
brief
why
we
need
a
rule
prohibiting
sales
and
this
of
course
applies
to
sales
of
all
products
including
literature.
we
didn't
single
out
literature.
we've
always
had
a
rule
prohibiting
sales
and
solicitations.
originally
it
was
a
rule
of
prior
approval,
now
it's
a
basic
general
rule
prohibiting
all
sales
to
avoid
charges
of
discrimination
and
other
problems,
but
basically
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
i
would
what?
ms.
lila
j.
young
that's
right.
we
would
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
right.
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
a
school
purpose
to
either
--
to
turn
into
a
marketplace
and
once
you
allow
some
sales
of
some
products,
then
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
ms.
lila
j.
young
well,
we
have
an
exception
in
our
sales
rule
that
if
anything
is
for
a
school
purpose
like
the
band
or
a
student
newspaper,
we
do
allow
that
type
of
sales,
but
that's
the
only
exception
that
we've
made.
ms.
lila
j.
young
not
inside
the
school,
they
can
do
it
beyond
the
school
house
gate.
ms.
lila
j.
young
we
would
permit
no
sales
of
any
products
including
papers.
ms.
lila
j.
young
for
our
--
you
mean,
the
school
student
paper?
ms.
lila
j.
young
well,
we
have
home
room
periods
and
it
depends
on
the
various
schools.
not
all
schools
--
ms.
lila
j.
young
the
school
would
pay
the
student
--
the
school
student
newspaper.
how
the
students
would
develop
their
own
private
commercial
enterprise
would
be
up
to
them.
they
would
have
to
do
that
outside
of
the
school.
ms.
lila
j.
young
that's
correct.
they
could
not
have
any
actual
sales
transactions
during
the
school
hours
in
the
school.
they'd
have
to
do
that
beyond
the
school
house
gates
and
we
did
not
make
an
exemption
for
literature
and
i
don't
believe
this
court's
decisions
for
instance
in
maabe
versus
white
plains
require
separate
special
rules
and
exemptions
for
the
product
of
literature.
i
believe
that
the
board
should
be
allowed
the
flexibility
and
reasonable
breadth
that
is
necessary
when
it's
prescribing
rules
of
student
conduct.
and
therefore
i
believe
that
all
our
rules
should
be
upheld
since
they
are
vitally
necessary
to
achieve
basic
educational
objectives
and
achieve
a
proper
atmosphere
so
that
any
learning
can
take
place.
