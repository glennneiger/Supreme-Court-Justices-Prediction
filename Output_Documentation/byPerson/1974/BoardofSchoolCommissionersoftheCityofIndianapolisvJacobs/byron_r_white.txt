what
would
--
could
you
--
i
suppose
you're
going
to
get
to
what
are
--
what
the
minimum
safeguards
are
that
you
think
the
board
is
entitled
to
impose
in
order
to
achieve
what
you
think
they
should
be
able
to
achieve?
justice
byron

that
--
would
that
--
whether
each
publication
or
would
they
say,
“we
want
to
put
out
and
apply
to
you”
and
say,
“we
want
to
put
out
a
paper
and
please
give
us
permission.”
justice
byron
r.
white
will
that
--
that
would
be
an
issue
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
was
the
--
suppose
the
authorities
just
didn't
agree
with
what
was
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
besides
the
--
beside
the
--
what
if
there
was
criticism
the
way
the
school
was
run?
justice
byron
r.
white
fellow
who
criticized?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
think
that
--
do
you
think
it
would
just
be
unmanageable
or
just
not
effective
if
the
school
had
the
rules
as
to
what
could
be
in
matter
--
in
materials
that
are
distributed
and
--
but
didn't
have
a
license,
didn't
have
a
pre-approval
system
that
you
would
just
--
if
someone
broke
the
rules
and
distributed
those
language
in
a
newspaper
suspend
him
or
punish
him
or
do
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
but
you
apparently
insist
on
wanting
prior
approval?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you'd
prefer,
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
your
position
is
here
as
to
what
you're
constitutionally
entitled
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
reason
that
you
insist
on
the
prior
review
is
because
the
subsequent
approach
is
ineffective
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
--
i
take
it
that
either
way
you
go
that
one
thing
you
would
insist
on
and
that
is
that
the
publishers
can't
be
anonymous?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
even
on
the
licensing
approach
you
would
insist
that
only
students
or
faculty
members
be
allowed
to
publish
on
this
--
in
the
school
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
which
says
should
the
defendants
apply
to
the
district
court
to
limit
the
injunction
to
high
schools,
nothing
in
this
decision
forecloses
the
consideration
of
the
application
as
a
matter
--

what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it

the

would
apply
exactly
the

way
to
elementary.
justice
byron

would
it
or
not?
justice
byron

white
you
don't
accept
it
down
the
age
13,
i
mean
anything
from
13
up
is

you
say
is
out
of
that
(voice

justice
byron

let's
assume
that,
the
board
eliminated
all
--
well,
didn't
eliminate
up
the
prohibition
of
obscenity
but
it
added
something
it
says
“in
these
papers
you
will
not
use
the
following
words
and
listed
them
and
no
others
of
the
same
kind”.
now,
what
about
some
of
the
four
letter
words
that
you
think
that
the
school
board
is
not
entitled
--
in
a
high
school
to
forbid
the
use
of
those
words
in
the
newspaper.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
a
rule
like
that
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
first
place,
i
--
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
hold
it
obscene
on
its
face
neither
did
the
court
--
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
that's
the
particular
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
this
in
its
application.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
say
that
just
a
rule
that
forbade
the
newspaper
to
publish
obscenity
would
be
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
is
the
scope
of
your
submission,
13
to
20.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
take
the
position
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
ginsburg
approach
to
obscenity
for
younger
people
survived
miller?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
seem
to
think
so,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
find
--
seem
to
distinct
that
because
the
--
because
it
wasn't
any
--
that
the
rules
were
bad
because
they
didn't
specify
the
conduct
stated
in
miller.
it
wouldn't
have
to
if
ginsburg
survived.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
made
that
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
meaning
you
think
they
are
wrong,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
a
question?
suppose
the
board
had
a
rule
that
by
any
definition
of
obscenity
or
of
bannable
words
you
would
agree,
describe
what
could
be
banned
clearly
and
you
would
think
it
could
be
banned.
i
take
it,
your
position
is
that
even
so,
the
board
must
wait
until
the
publication
has
occurred.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
he
board
may
not
say,
“i
want
to
check
on
this
distribution
here
before
it
goes
out
to
make
sure
that
this
bannable
material
is
not
on
the
paper.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what's
your
--
you
think
that
is
even
--
that
rule
against
prior
restraint
would
apply
right
across
the
board
in
high
schools?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
--
and
you
also
insist
on
anonymity?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
don't
know,
there
a
lot
of
people
wouldn't
it
--
might
like
to
criticize
the
school
authorities
without
knowing
that
they
known
who
they
are
and
like
to
tell
some
teachers
are
very
bad
and
they
wouldn't
like
to
know
--
especially
if
it's
a
member
of
that
class,
wouldn't
like
to
know
who's
talking.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
essential
for
your
submission,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
suppose
the
students
should
do
to
raise
their
money
to
publish
a
paper
of
the
kind
that
even
your
school
would
think
was
a
good
idea?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
wouldn't
permit
solicitation
or
contributions
to
support
the
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
permit
sale
of
the
paper?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
how
do
you
raise
the
money
for
the
student
paper?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
how
about
--
how
are
they
supposed
to
pay
for
the
--
pay
the
cost
of
producing
a
student
newspaper?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
couldn't
sell
them
on
the
school?
