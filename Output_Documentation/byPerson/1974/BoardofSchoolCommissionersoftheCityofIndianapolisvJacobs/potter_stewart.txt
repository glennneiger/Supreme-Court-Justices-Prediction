well,
is
there
anything
in

led
a

to
get
the
impression
that
only
high
schools
were
involved?

i
mean
the
impression
that
their

justice

stewart
that
the
claim
is
made
by
your

that
these

applied
to

only.
that
they're
only
talking
about
high
schools.

who
were
the
plaintiffs
or
the
class
of
plaintiffs?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
the
complaint.
was
it
--
it
was
a
class
action,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
those
two
had
graduated?
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
--
was
there
a
declaration
of
a
certification
of
a
class
action?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
class?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
the
colloquy
i
have
noticed
the
closing
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
--
excuse
me.
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
criminal
statute,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
mean
that
then,
do
you,
that
you
could
be
sent
to
prison
for
--
justice

stewart
that's
probably
true
about
obscenity
but
this
isn't
an
obscenity
case,
is
it?
this
is
quite
different.
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
rules?
what's
--
what
is
involved
here
is
the
rules,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
we're
talking
about
the
rules
--
justice
potter

there's
some
place
here
where
all
the
rules
are
set
out
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice

(voice

agree
with
you,
but
that
doesn't
end
the
case,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
--
so
let's
put
another
way,
its
from
the
9th
through
the
12th
grade.
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
age.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
case
(voice

i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
a
different
and
more
difficult
case
if
that's
brought
here
if
you
keep
books
out
of
your
library.
justice
potter
stewart
these
rules
apply
only
inside
the
school,
don't
they?
in
rule
11.05
for
example
says,
â€œin
any
school
--

potter
stewart

of
them
does
say

justice
potter
stewart
--
in
the
school
or
on
the
campus.

potter
stewart
yeah,
right.
