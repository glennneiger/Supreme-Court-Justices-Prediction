what
is
your
answer
to
mrs.
young's
hypothetical
and
if
she
hadn't
raised
it,
i
would
have?
do
you
concede
that
this
court
can
or
has
the
power
to
proscribe
language
that
is
used
in
this
courtroom?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
so
then,
do
you
contend
that
a
court
has
greater
control
over
the
speech
of
mature
lawyers
than
a
school
does
over
those
of
--
speech
of
teenagers?

you

merely
trying
to
focus
on
what
he
was.
he
was
the
principal
of
the
school?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
why
shouldn't
an
assistant
principal
of
a
whole
system
know
whether
a
paper
is
being
published
in
a
particular
school?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
pinkus
have
used
them
so
interchangeably
that's
why
it's
confusing.

harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
would
avoid
