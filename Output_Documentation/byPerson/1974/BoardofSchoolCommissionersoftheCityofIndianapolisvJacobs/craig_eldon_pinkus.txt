mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
first
of
all
aside
from
hazards
of
argument
to
address
myself
to
what
we
regard
as
the
issue
that
mr.
justice
stewart
was
inquiring
about
whether
this
case
thus
indeed
involve
elementary
students
in
any
way
whatsoever.
and
we
say
most
emphatically
it
does
not
involve
elementary
students
in
any
way
except
that
the
injunction
which
was
issued
by
the
district
court
thus
indeed
go
to
rules
which
cover
the
entire
system.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
precisely
justice
stewart.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
which
is
exactly
what
we
think
they
ought
to
have
done.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well
we
didn't
argue
that
they
were
not
entitled
to
reversal.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well,
we
take
the
position
that
we've
never
represented
the
elementary
students,
they've
never
been
in
our
class,
they've
never
been
involved
in
the
evidentiary
proceedings.
we've
never
briefed
or
argued
on
their
behalf
and
we
really
have
no
objection
to
this
court
finding
that
the
seventh
circuit
was
wrong
insofar
as
it
refused
to
rule
on
elementary
students.
we're
here
before
this
court
on
behalf
of
a
class
of
people
from
13
to
20
years
old.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
indeed
he
did
your
honor
and
i'd
like
to
point
to
page
110
of
the
transcript,
this
is
not
in
the
appendix
but
there
in
a
colloquy
with
judge
stackler
i
said
the
following
to
him,
“and
we
have
prepared
now
in
our
prayer,
i
would
agree
with
the
court,
it
is
undoubtedly
framed
in
language
which
would
be
overly
broad.
it's
a
sin
lawyers
often
commit.
i
would
say
however
that
the
reason
for
not
presenting
the
court
for
the
tendered
temporary
restraining
order
form
so
that
it
would
be
possible
perhaps
to
arrive
in
some
joint
fashion
in
terms
of
time,
place
and
manner
of
distribution,
which
we
endeavor
to
do
from
the
beginning
of
our
representation
in
this
case.”
so,
i
think
we
made
it
clear
from
the
beginning
that
we
did
use
some
broad
language.
this
was
the
hearing
on
the
temporary
restraining
order.
again
the
citation
is
page
110
of
the
transcript.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well,
we
think
that
there
is
some
emotional
difference
justice
white.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no.
but
we
think
that
there
is
some
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i'm
not
clear
if
it
would
or
not.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
would
say
that
i
can
imagine
under
the
ginsburg
concept
that
a
careful
delineation
of
age
groups
would
be
constitutional
under
the
first
amendment.
i
simply
don't
know
how
precisely
how
those
groups
must
be
delineated
and
that's
the
answer
that
i
must
give
you
and
we
accept
the
ginsburg
concept.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no
sir.
on
the
contrary
we
would
be
pleased
to
live
with
the
new
york's
statute
in
ginsburg
in
this
case.
we
would
be
very
pleased
to
have
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
agreed
but
it
did
contain
some
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no.
i
mean
that
it
contains
some
definitions
justice
stewart.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
seventeen
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
it
contains
definitions
of
what
obscenity
is
that
have
some
specificity.
here
the
board's
rule
which
is
found
both
in
the
appendix
and
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
1.1.1
says
“obscene.”
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no
sir.
i'm
talking
about
specificity
in
light
of
the
court's
miller
in
related
cases.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes
sir.
sir
i
believe
they
are
not
entitled
to
forbid
any
of
the
words
that
they
are
complaining
about
before
this
court
in
high
school
publications
per
se
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
they
have
focused
upon
words.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
think
that
they
can
fashion
an
obscenity
rule
with
respect
to
the
age
group
involved
that
is
more
restrictive
than
the
rules
that
would
apply
to
adults,
but
they've
not
done
it.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
regardless
of
context,
the
important
point
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
we
believe
sir
that
there
must
to
be
covered
in
any
way
by
the
obscenity
concept
there
must
be
something
erotic
in
the
material
involved.
and
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well
sir,
it
was
framed
as
an
obscenity
case.
the
original
answer
filed
by
the
school
stated
that
the
publications
were
obscene,
that's
in
the
appendix
at
page
3a
i
believe.
the
statement
of
mr.
kelp,
the
superintendent,
who
said
you
may
not
distribute
this
publication
any
longer
in
the
record
was,
it
is
obscene.
the
briefs
of
the
school
board
have
said
that
it's
obscene
so
we
must
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes
sir
and
1.1.1
says
that
distributable
literature
excludes
that
which
is
obscene.
it
is
not
in
our
brief.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well
i
think
sir
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
think
that
they
did
find
it
over
broad
as
i
understand
the
opinion
your
honor.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
because
--
well,
there
is
imprecision
here,
i
grant.
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
was
concentrate
on
the
breadth
provided
by
tinker.
the
variable
obscenity
concept
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no
sir
i
would
not.
we're
i'm
talking
about
earthy
words
in
this
case,
that's
what
i
wish
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well,
yes
except
that
the
board
is
contending
that
the
earthy
words
violate
these
rules.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes
sir.
it
is
in
--
the
rules
are
in
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
they're
in
two
locations.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
one
is
in
the
beige
bound
volume
and
the
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
that's
the
appendix.
the
other
is
at
page
33a
to
the
--
no,
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no
mr.
chief
justice.
we
believe
that
more
restrictive
standards
than
those
that
are
applicable
to
adults
under
miller
and
related
cases
can
be
acceptable
in
this
setting.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
didn't
understand
that
sir.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
words
in
their
context
have
anything
to
do
with
obscenity
or
lewdness
and
the
court
has
agreed
with
us.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no
sir.
but
i
am
attempting
to
respond
to
the
board's
argument.
the
board
has
characterized
the
corn
cub
curtain
as
an
obscene
publication.
there's
simply
no
question
about
that
and
i'm
attempting
to
respond
to
their
argument.
i
am
glad
to
agree
with
any
of
the
justices
that
obscenity
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
obscene
about
the
corn
cub
curtain
under
any
standard
and
that's
what
i
meant
when
i
was
saying
i'd
be
glad
to
apply
the
ginsburg
type
definitions
which
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
that
is
correct
justice
rehnquist.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well,
we
think
that
in
a
sense
the
question
on
this
issue
is
whether
a
public
high
school
is
more
like
a
jail
or
the
united
states
army
with
parker
and
aderley
in
mind
which
has
been
relied
upon
the
board,
or
it's
more
like
a
university
in
papish.
now,
we
think
that
the
principal
matter
that
we'd
like
to
argue
about
the
position
of
these
words
per
se
and
i
urge
the
justices
in
the
court
to
read
these
publications
because
they
are
so
infrequent.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes,
but
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
do
and
i
heard
some
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
think
they're
much
different
environments
and
i
think
that
i
heard
language
here
from
mr.
clancy
yesterday
in
the
pursue
of
limited
course
that
undoubtedly
would
have
been
equally
as
objectionable
if
it
had
been
contained
in
the
corn
cub
curtain
which
had
--
was
not.
i
mean,
i
think
that
context
is
the
very
vital
thing.
i
think
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well
sir,
i'm
arguing
that
context
is
extremely
vital
and
that
--
to
simply
pick
out
a
word
and
say
this
word
is
always
inappropriate
in
a
student
publication
goes
very,
very
far
beyond
what
the
first
amendment
should
be
permitted
to
tolerate
and
i
would
like
to
stress
that
we
have
quite
a
double
standard.
these
words
are
in
the
dictionaries,
they
are
in
the
new
york
times,
they
are
in
the
wall
street
journal
reporting
comments
from
presidential
tapes.
these
words
are
in
novels
that
are
in
the
libraries
of
our
schools
like
catcher
in
the
rye,
all
of
these
is
conceded
and
we
don't
understand
why
if
these
words
appear
in
a
completely
non-erotic
context
but
they
are
in
a
non-official
student
publication
that
they
must
be
proscribed
when
they
are
in
the
dictionaries
and
the
newspapers
and
the
magazines
and
the
books,
that's
our
position.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well,
i
really
don't
know
the
position
on
that
justice
rehnquist
because
quite
frankly
i've
never
dealt
with
the
elementary
school
context
in
this
litigation
and
i've
--
i
incidentally
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes.
and
we
continue
to
agree
that
we
would
be
willing
to
have
that
limited.
we're
not
prepared
to
argue
the
elementary
context.
i
would
like
to
make
a
point
about
maturity.
there
is
some
reason
i
think
reading
the
court's
opinion
in
wisconsin
versus
yoder.
footnote
15
pointed
out
the
fact
there
that
we
still
have
many
states
in
this
nation
where
8th
grade
education
is
the
final
grade
that's
required
that
people
of
the
age
that
begins
high
school
can
be
excused
in
several
states,
and
that
footnote
notes
that
indiana
is
one
of
those
states.
in
indiana,
a
person
who
is
a
freshman
in
high
school
can
be
excused
to
go
to
work.
so
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
dividing
line
there
and
we
think
the
state's
labor
scheme
recognizes
the
dividing
line
there
we're
simply
not
prepared
to
say
what
it
ought
--
what
the
standards
ought
to
be
for
people
below
that
dividing
line.
we're
here
only
dealing
with
people
who
are
above
that
dividing
line
and
we've
tried
as
carefully
as
possible
to
limit
our
actions.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no
sir.
we
--
i
was
quoting
the
testimony
from
now
superintendent
kelp
when
he
was
characterizing
the
age
range
attending
the
high
schools
in
indianapolis,
indiana
and
he
stated
that
the
age
range
was
from
13
to
20
and
that
is
at
page
47a.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes
sir.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes
sir.
and
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
--
to
the
extent
that
i
indicated
that
14
was
the
cut
off,
the
--
i
would
grant
that
there
may
be
one
confused
year
in
there
but
we
are
talking
about
the
elementary
versus
the
high
school
setting.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well,
i
must
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well,
justice
white
i'm
inclined
to
think
you
maybe
correct.
i
think
what
the
seventh
circuit
was
saying
there
was
that
the
--
to
the
extent
that
the
ginsburg
case
relied
upon
preexisting
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes
sir.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
mr.
chief
justice
that's
really
not
quite
our
position,
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
13
year
olds
in
high
school
sir,
to
be
as
accurate
as
i
can
be.
we
have
only
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no,
it
does
not
and
it
should
be
narrowed
and
we
agreed
before
the
seventh
circuit
it
should
be
narrowed
and
i
agreed
before
the
trial
court
that
the
complaint
was
broad
in
the
statement
of
the
relief
prayed
for
and
i
still
take
that
position
sir.
i
--
we
just
--
are
only
interested
in
the
high
school
environment
and
if
there
are
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well,
that
was
the
environment
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes,
regardless
of
age.
that
was
the
environment
in
which
the
publication
was
distributed.
it
was
done
by
high
school
students
and
to
the
extent
there
are
precocious
people
able
to
get
into
high
at
the
age
of
13,
they
are
included.
i'd
like
to
briefly
respond
to
the
question
earlier,
the
citation
to
ginsburg
in
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
is
at
29a
of
the
opinion
which
is
found
in
the
petition
for
the
writ
certiorari's
appendix
and
that
there
mr.
justice
white
they
do
quote
at
the
top
paragraph
that
they
say
they
don't
have
to
speculate
about
the
exact
effect
of
miller
on
the
variable
obscenity
concept
by
ginsburg,
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
what
is
really
our
point.
well,
i
think
their
point
is
that
no
matter
what
kind
of
names
we
use,
we're
not
talking
about
obscenity
here.
we're
talking
about
words
that
bothers
some
people
in
some
context,
that
we
are
talking
about
vulgarity
perhaps.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
think
that
that's
quite
possible
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes.
we
do
not
say
that
ginsburg
should
be
abandoned
as
i've
tried
to
make
clear.
we
are
not
arguing
that
position
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
students
who
put
this
out
have
never
argued
that.
the
front
page
of
the
second
issue
of
the
corn
cub
curtain
is
an
article
on
student
rights
and
it
says,
“freedom
of
the
press
and
the
right
of
petition,
the
right
to
distribute
circulars
and
publications
on
campus
so
long
as
there
is
no
interference
with
school
work
or
the
rights
of
others
and
provided
that
the
publication
is
not
libelous
or
obscene.
”
they
printed
these
on
their
publication
months
before
anyone
told
them
to
stop
distributing
it
and
it's
been
our
position
all
along.
we
don't
feel
that
pornography
is
necessarily
something
that
can
be
distributed
to
minors
and
we
think
ginsburg
is
still
viable
and
i'd
like
to
add
a
couple
of
notes
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
discussions
of
the
administrators
that
lead
to
the
statement
to
this
publication
could
not
be
distributed
were
inaugurated
by
jeff
jacobs,
one
of
the
student
plaintiffs.
he
heard
an
announcement
over
the
public
address
system
which
put
a
doubt
in
his
mind
about
whether
he
was
entitled
to
distribute
this.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
he
had
previously
talked
to
the
vice
principal,
mr.
wally
potter
who
said,
“well,
he
just
didn't
know
for
sure
whether
they
could
or
not
but
he
didn't
want
to
overreact
to
the
situation.
”and
in
the
appendix
of
his
testimony
that
he
knowingly
permitted
the
distribution
of
this
publication
in
the
high
schools
until
the
time
that
this
young
man,
jeff
jacobs
called
the
superintendent's
office
and
said,
“i
heard
an
announcement
over
the
public
address
system,
does
it
mean
that
i
can't
distribute
the
publication?”
i
think
the
court
should
know
that
we're
dealing
with
people
who
tried
to
resolve
this
matter
lawfully
and
that
from
the
day
he
heard
that
announcement
on
the
public
address
system
until
the
day
the
court
issued
its
injunction
this
publication
was
suspended
entirely.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
precisely.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
precisely,
precisely
and
one
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no,
we
think
that
the
--
i'd
like
to
make
two
points
on
that.
first,
the
anonymity
rule
if
read
carefully
is
superfluous
because
under
their
definitions
once
you
get
down
to
what's
distributable,
it
can't
be
libelous.
it
can't
be
obscene
so
the
justification
for
anonymity
is
gone
since
they
are
theoretically
will
be
no
libel
actions
and
no
obscenity
prosecutions.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
we
think
that
that's
a
valuable
right
which
should
be
protected
and
that
high
school
journalism
is
not
so
different
from
grown-up
journalism,
if
you
will,
that
the
new
york
times
is
to
be
treated
differently
to
the
extent
that
prior
restraints
against
its
publications
bear
an
extremely
heavy
constitutional
burden
whereas
they
don't
here.
and
i'd
like
to
mention
on
this
matter
of
criticism,
justice
white,
at
page
53a
and
following
is
the
allegedly
defamatory
article
about
the
football
coach
at
tech
high
school.
now
jeff
jacobs
himself
was
a
football
player
at
that
high
school
and
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
53a
of
the
appendix,
the
beige
bound
document.
this
did
contain
some
criticism
but
its
criticism
to
my
mind
of
the
most
mild
and
if
you
will
school
spirited
variety.
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
paragraph
for
example,
the
student
writer
says,
“when
i
was
a
freshman,
i
want
to
prove
them
wrong.”
mr.
coot's
assistant
football
coach
last
year
really
put
pride
in
me,
taught
me
the
meaning.
i
really
loved
him
for
this
but
all
he
has
taught
me
has
been
torn
down
by
the
coaches
this
year.”
continuing
on
to
54a,
he's
--
the
student
writer
says,
“i
was
wrong.
it
took
me
four
years
to
learn
that
i
and
anybody
thinking
they
are
over
the
coaches
head
are
dead
wrong
and
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
that
is
at
54a
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
the
very
bottom,
the
sentence
beginning
“i
was
wrong,
it
took
me
four
years
to
learn…”
and
then
here
is
what
i
take
to
be
the
allegedly
defamatory
material.
they
say
that
the
coaches
do
not
play
the
right
people.
he
is
prejudiced,
he
is
outdated
and
he
is
pigheaded.”
they
may
even
say
he
is
inhuman.
well
this
may
all
be
slightly
true
except
the
latter
and
they
spelled
it
wrong.
if
he
makes
these
mistakes,
he
is
nothing
but
human.
the
athlete
should
realize
this.
i
am
not
saying
they
are
entirely
wrong
but
that
they
by
arguing
who
is
right
and
wrong
are
destroying
tech's
athletic
program
and
the
whole
thrust
of
these
articles
is
that
a
school
with
5,000
students
ought
to
have
the
best
football
team
in
indiana
because
it's
the
biggest
school
in
indiana.
and
they
can't
understand
why
they
used
to
have
good
football
teams
but
they
don't
have
good
football
teams
anymore.
now,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
defamatory
in
there
and
if
these
articles
are
read,
they
convey
a
concept
of
concern,
of
interest
in
having
the
football
team
perform
better
on
the
field
and
there
is
a
lot
of
very
positive
talk
in
here
and
that's
the
tenor
of
this
publication.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
signed
that
way
as
an
anonymous
in
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes,
the
evidence,
the
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
with
all
due
respect,
there
is
testimony
about
the
printing
and
reproduction
processes
here.
they
were
rather
primitive.
there
was
not
much
money
to
work
with.
the
evidence
in
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well,
i
don't
think
that
it
was
necessarily
his
spelling
sir.
the
final
reproduction
of
the
paper
need
not
necessarily
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no,
not
until
this
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
not
until
this
whole
matter
began.
in
fact
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
evidence
shows
that
carl
kelp,
the
superintendent
did
not
even
know
what
the
corn
cob
curtain
was
until
the
day
jeff
jacobs
got
through
to
him
on
the
telephone
and
asked,
“may
we
distribute
this
publication?”
and
it
had
been
distributed
through
the
fifth
issue
and
i'd
like
to
make
clear
that
they
only
distributed
200
out
of
the
fifth
issue
and
they
printed
approximately
3,000.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no.
no,
justice
blackmun.
the
super
--
the
principal
of
tech
high
school
where
jeff
jacobs
went
to
school
said
that
it
--
he
didn't
know
if
it
was
all
right
but
that
he
should
distribute
in
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
no
sir.
carl
kelp
was
at
the
time
jeff
jacobs
called
him,
the
assistant
principal
of
the
indianapolis
public
school
system.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
well,
the
record
describes
that
it
was
his
job
to
keep
track
of
these
things
and
he
submitted
numerous
exhibits
that
showed
various
publications
that
he
prohibited.
furthermore,
the
rule
that
we
originally
litigated
against
said
there
shall
be
no
distribution
without
the
express
prior
approval
of
the
general
superintendent.
the
general
superintendent
had
delegated
this
job
to
his
assistant
superintendent,
mr.
kelp
who
is
now
the
general
superintendent
of
the
school
system.
so
it
was
his
job,
that's
his
testimony.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
that's
correct.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
appreciate
that,
i
trust
it
is
now
clear.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
would
recommend
an
adoption
of
rules
on
the
prohibition
of
obscenities
and
i
think
i
would
be
inclined
to
draw
heavily
on
the
definitions
used
in
the
ginsburg
case
that
involved
descriptions
of
various
conditions
of
nudity,
descriptions
of
sexual
acts
in
a
degree
of
detail
none
of
which
we
have
here.
we
only
have
one
phrase
that
approaches
that
and
i
would
utilize
that
kind
of
an
approach
which
i
think
would
be
acceptable
and
would
be
within
the
court's
ruling
in
that
area.
even
though
there
would
not
be
immediate
criminal
sanctions
there
would
be
eventual
criminal
sanctions
as
we'd
recognize
because
if
a
person
is
expelled,
that
person
is
also
subject
to
juvenile
process
as
a
truant
and
so
on.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
think
that's
correct.
i
--
we
have
never
objected
to
rule
against
material
which
is
libelous
either,
i
wish
to
make
that
clear.
i
do
have
some
doubt
in
my
mind
about
the
way
in
which
as
a
public
school
would
go
about
enforcing
any
kind
of
remedy
if
they
were
libel
because
i
think
it
would
be
primarily
an
individual
matter
of
vindication
of
personal
rights
of
anyone
who
considered
himself
to
have
been
libeled.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
i
would
indeed
justice
brennan.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes.
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes,
regardless
of
that
context
--
mr.
craig
eldon
pinkus
yes
we
would.
