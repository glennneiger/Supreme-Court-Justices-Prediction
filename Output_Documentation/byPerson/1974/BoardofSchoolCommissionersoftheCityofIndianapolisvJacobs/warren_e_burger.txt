e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1347,
the
school
board
against
jacobs.
mrs.
young.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mrs.
young.
mr.
pinkus.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
you're
saying,
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
it
is
that
the
students
in
the
high
schools
may
say,
express
anything,
say,
express
or
depict
with
pictures,
anything
unless
it
violates
the
miller,
adult
paris
theater
line
of
cases
of
a
year
ago.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
i
think
you
were
thinking
this
entirely
on
obscenity.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
few
minutes
ago
you
were
responding
to
mr.
justice
white
that
this
was
an
obscenity
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
difference
is
that
he
was
using
it
because
he
was
repeating
it
out
of
a
record
in
a
case
before
the
court.
there
may
have
been
some
question
about
his
good
taste
in
judgment
in
using
it
instead
of
letting
us
read
it,
but
he
wasn't
using
that
language
in
the
sense
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
is
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
this
age
group
in
your
response
to
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
justice
stewart
that
it
is
essentially
from
the
9th
grade
through
the
12th.
what
if
13
is
an
age
where
you
have
relatively
few
13
year
olds
in
high
school
normally,
relatively
few,
you'd
concede
that
as
you
have
relatively
few
20
year
olds,
those
were
the
two
extremes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
you've
got
a
13
year
olds,
14
and
13
and
14
in
grade
school
and
they
publish
some
of
this
kind
of
material
for
a
grade
school
publication,
then
you
would
say
they're
protected
then
under
your
13
to
20
range,
their
freedom,
their
first
amendment
right
can't
be
interfered
with?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
is
if
its
13,
(voice

--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
what
the
injunction
says,
13
year
olds
in
high
school?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
regardless
of
age.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
old
was
this
growing
young
man
at
the
time
who
wrote
this,
how
old
was
he
when
he
wrote
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
is
a
high
school
student?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suppose
these
general
activities
that
are
been
under
in
discussion
here
for
now
an
hour
have
any
relationship
to
the
fact
that
he
misspells
three
very
elementary
words
in
there
in
one
paragraph?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
the
spelling?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
reject.
you
would
say
that
the
first
amendment
forbids
one
of
the
things
that
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
namely
a
list
that
could
be
drawn
out
of
a
proscribed
words?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(voice
overlap)
and
all
other
prior
restraints,
you
would
reject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you
mr.
pinkus.
mrs.
young,
i
think
you've
used
all
of
your
time
too.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
haven't
informed
me
correctly
here.
i'm
not
up
to
date.
no,
you've
got
ten
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
bible.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
young.
thank
your
mr.
pinkus.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

have
also
to
announce

and
opinion

the

73-1347,
