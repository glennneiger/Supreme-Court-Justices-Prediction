one
of
the
basis
of
judge
christensen's
dissent
in
the
seventh
circuit
wasn't
it,
was
that
the
majority
failed
to
distinguish
in
its
opinion
between
application
to
high
schools
and
application
to
elementary
schools?
justice
william

rehnquist
why
shouldn't
the
petitioners
--
why
shouldn't
they
be
entitled
to
a
reversal
from
the
seventh
circuit
on
that
point
rather
than
simply
telling
them
to
go
back
and
move
the
district
court
to
modify?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
you
concede
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
wrong
insofar
that
it
is
--
it
affirmed
that
portion
of
the
district
court's
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judge
stackler
really
gave
you
a
broader
injunction
than
you
asked
for
then
in
the
seventh

where
the

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
go
further
and
say
that
since
there
is
nothing
obscene
even
variably
obscene
under
ginsburg,
the
school
board
can't
prohibit
the
use
of
particulars,
specified
words
that
are
just
regarded
as
being
in
very
bad
taste
in
public
conversations
around
the
dinner
table?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
basis?
what
case
of
this
court
do
you
rely
on
with
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
you
wouldn't
carry
it
over
to
elementary
schools.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
an
implicit
in
that
paragraph
of
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion
certainly
is
the
notion
that
miller
covered
all
aspects
of
obscenity
and
that
if
you
can't
tie
ginsburg
into
the
language
of
miller
as
written,
ginsburg
didn't
survive,
don't
you
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you've
used
a
couple
of
words
kind
of
interchangeably
it
seems
to
me
or
perhaps
i'm
just
misunderstood.
is
it
fair
to
say
that
generally
the
principal
and
assistant
principal
are
associated
with
individual
high
schools
and
the
superintendent
and
assistant
superintendent
are
associated
with
the
school
system
as
a
whole?

must
