what's
alive
in

today?
justice

i
take
it
from
what
you've
been
saying
that
you
would
agree
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
a
school
boy
to
have
some
rules
covering
this
area.
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
visualize
the
first
amendment
as
having
three
levels
of
application.
one,
to
people
who
are
in
a
high
school
and
above
20;
one,
to
people
who
are
in
high
school
between
15
and
20
and
the
third
application
of
the
first
amendment
to
people
who
are
not
in
high
school
and
who
are
under
13.
we're
talking
about
the
high
school
intermediate
level,
a
first
amendment
application.
if
you
were
the
superintendent
of
schools,
what
recommendation
would
you
make
to
the
school
board
as
to
rules
that
would
be
constitutional?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
no
prior
restraint,
no
prior
consultation.
the
only
limitation
would
be
on
obscenity
as
defined
and
that
definition
would
not
be
the
miller
definition,
but
would
be
closer
to
what
was
said
in
ginsburg?
