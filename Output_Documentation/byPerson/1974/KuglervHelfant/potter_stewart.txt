these
two

cases
are

reason
of
the
grant
of
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
edwin
h.
helfant
brought
this
action
in
a
federal
district
court
to
enjoin
the
attorney
general
of
new
jersey
and
other
new
jersey
officials
from
proceeding
with
the
prosecution
of
an
indictment
pending
against
him
in
that
state.
his
complaint
alleged
that
he
had
been
coerced
into
testifying
before
a
state
grand
jury
by
the
concerted
action
of
a
state
deputy
attorney
general
and
members
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
and
that
the
indictment
charging
him
with
obstruction
of
justice
and
false
swearing
had
grown
out
of
that
coerced
testimony.
his
complaint
further
alleged
that
the
significant
role
played
by
the
members
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
in
coercing
his
testimony
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
receive
a
fair
trial
in
the
state-court
system.
the
district
court
dismissed
his
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
principles
of
the
case
of
younger
against
harris
precluded
federal
intervention
in
a
state
criminal
proceeding.
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
that
order
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
helfant's
request
for
permanent
injunction.
upon
petition
of
the
defendant
state
officials,
the
court
of
appeals
then
set
the
case
for
an
en
banc
rehearing.
the
full
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
permanent
injunction
of
the
state
criminal
prosecution
would
be
inappropriate,
but,
with
three
judges
dissenting,
nonetheless
reversed
the
trial
court's
order
of
dismissal.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
for
the
purpose
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court
on
helfant's
charge
that
his
grand
jury
testimony
had
been
coerced,
and
for
the
entry
of
a
declaratory
judgment,
based
upon
that
hearing,
on
the
question
whether
helfant's
grand
jury
testimony
should
be
admitted
into
evidence
at
the
state
criminal
trial.
the
district
court
was
directed
to
enjoin
further
proceedings
in
the
state
criminal
prosecution
pending
entry
of
its
declaratory
judgment.
the
state
officials
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
seeking
review
of
the
court
of
appeals'
remand
to
the
district
court
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
declaratory
judgment
on
the
issue
of
coercion.
helfant
filed
a
cross-petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
challenging
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
permanent
injunctive
relief
was
not
warranted.
we
granted
both
petitions
to
consider
the
propriety
of
federal-court
intervention
in
pending
state
criminal
proceedings
in
the
circumstances
presented
by
this
case.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
the
written
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
affirmed
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
helfant's
prayer
for
a
permanent
injunction
but
that
the
appellate
court
was
in
error
in
ordering
a
hearing
and
declaratory
judgment
on
the
issue
of
the
admissibility
of
his
grand
jury
testimony
in
a
state
criminal
prosecution.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
with
directions
to
enter
a
judgment
affirming
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
complaint.

justice
douglas

or

this
case.
