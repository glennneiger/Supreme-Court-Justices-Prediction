mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
initially,
i
should
point
out
the
procedural
context
in
which
this
case
comes
before
the
court.
in
the
federal
district
court,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
and
the
attorney
general
and
the
deputy
attorney
general,
labeled
as
the
defendants
were
successful
in
making
a
motion
under
federal
rule
12
(b)
(6)
and
obtained
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint,
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
for
which
relief
could
be
granted
and
also
at
the
same
time,
were
able
to
block
the
application
for
preliminary
restrain.
at
this
juncture
the
procedure,
the
plaintiff
is
entitled,
the
plaintiff
judge
helfant
is
entitled
to
have
all
the
facts
that
he
has
established
regarded
as
true,
together
with
the
reasonable
inferences
that
flow
there
from.
now,
the
defendants
in
this
case
have
not
answered
the
complaint,
they
have
not
filed
an
affidavit.
they
have
not
introduced
one
iota
of
testimony
before
the
federal
court
and
their
defense
in
this
case
is
essentially
ingenious
argument,
which
is
not
based
on
the
record
and
dealing
with
the
record,
we
contend
that
the
facts
that
have
been
established
in
that
record
meet
the
requisites
of
equity
intervention
in
a
pending
state
criminal
proceeding
that
there
is
irreparable
damage
that
is
great
and
immediate,
that
this
case
falls
within
the
extraordinary
circumstances
doctrine
of
younger
v.
harris,
the
unusual
circumstances
doctrine
of
steffel
v.
thompson;
the
extremely
rare
case
referred
to
by
chief
justice
burger
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
allee
v.
medrano
and
that
it
meets
the
bad
faith
and
harassment
requirements
so
that
right
across
the
board,
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
in
this
pending
state
criminal
proceeding.
now
the
facts,
as
i
heard
them
from
my
opponent,
are
not
the
facts
that
are
--
the
complete
facts
that
are
in
the
record.
initially
to
start
with,
while
the
plaintiff
was
called
before
the
state
grand
jury,
he
not
only
refused
to
go
before
the
state
grand
jury,
but
he
had
a
hearing
before
a
trial
court,
which
ordered
him
to
appear
before
the
state
grand
jury.
he
then
attempted
to
appeal
and
over
the
telephone,
actually
appealed
this
decision
to
the
appellate
division,
which
is
the
immediate
appeals
tribunal
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
he
was
unsuccessful
in
that
joint
telephone
call
with
the
attorney
general,
and
he
attempted
to
contact
the
supreme
court,
and
he
was
unable
to
do
so,
and
he
finally
had
to
go
before
the
grand
jury.
in
other
words,
he
did
everything
humanly
possible
to
resort
to
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
to
keep
from
testifying.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
he
did
and
went
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
he
objected
to
testifying
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes
sir.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes,
and
he
found
that
he
had
to
go
in
the
room
mr.
justice
and
at
--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes,
and
that's
exactly
what
he
did
mr.
chief
justice.
he
resorted
completely
to
his
privilege
on
that
occasion.
and
he
was
again
subpoena
to
reappear
before
this
grand
jury,
and
there
is
in
the
record,
a
letter
from
one
of
his
counsel
to
co-counsel
indicating
that
his
intention
was
still
to
resort
to
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
we
must
watch
the
time
context
here
because
i
think
this
is
important.
on
the
late
afternoon,
about
3:30
of
november
the
6,
in
our
court
system
that
closes
at
4
o'clock
at
the
afternoon,
he
received
a
call
from
the
administrative
director
of
the
courts.
the
next
day
and
i
think
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
and
i
think
it's
in
the
brief,
it
was
an
election
day
that
all
the
official
activities
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
were
closed
down.
so
at
3:30,
on
november
the
6,
he
was
told
to
appear
before
the
supreme
court
in
private
session.
he
says
why,
why
are
you
calling
me
and
no
answer
was
given.
he
was
just
told
to
be
there.
the
call
was
not
made
to
counsel,
the
call
was
made
directly
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
he
then
appeared
at
10
minutes
of
10
before
the
supreme
court
and
now,
after
a
great
deal
of
exchanging
of
briefs,
the
state
has
finally
admitted
that
not
only
did
the
supreme
court
questioned
the
plaintiff,
but
it
had
before
it
the
raw
grand
jury
testimony,
the
actual
testimony
of
an
incomplete
criminal
investigation.
they
had
obtained
that
from
the
attorney
general
in
violation
of
their
own
rules,
which
calls
for
the
secrecy
of
grand
jury
proceedings.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
that's
correct
your
honor,
in
their
private
chamber
and
there
is
one
other
thing
that
i
should
state
at
this
time,
and
i
have
heard
it
where
the
attorney
general
was
arguing
this
case
with
me.
seated
in
that
private
chamber
at
that
time
were
two
judges
of
the
appellate
division,
which
again
points
up
the
power
and
the
integratability
of
the
new
jersey
court
system.
there
was
a
judge
conford
who
was
a
member
of
the
appellate
division
who
was
actually
temporarily
assigned
to
the
supreme
court
and
justice
sullivan
who
had
not
yet
been
elevated
to
the
supreme
court,
who
was
also
a
member
of
the
appellate
division,
and
they
were
filling
in
for
other
justices
who
were
either
have
resigned
or
were
absent.
so
that
there
were
two
judges
of
the
intermediate
appeals
court,
sitting
in
that
room
when
the
plaintiff
entered
the
room.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes,
sir,
they
were
there
in
connection
with
their
regular
duties.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes
sir,yes
sure.
and
i
apologize
for
that
not
being
in
the
briefs
with
all
the
briefing
we
did
that
should
have
been
in
there.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
there
were
one
short,
there
were
six.
i
believe
there
was
one
that
was
missing,
judge
proctor
was
not
actually
in
at
that
time.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
he
got
there
about
10
minutes
of
10,
his
meeting
before
the
grand
jury
was
at
10
o'clock
and
when
he
said
to
the
administrative
director
who
called
him,
i
have
to
be
before
the
state
grand
jury
at
10
o'clock,
he
said
we
know
all
about
it.
so
for
this
statutory,
for
this
constitutional
mandated
inquiry
that
my
opponent
speaks
of,
they
allow
themselves
10
minutes,
10
minutes
of
time,
and
they
have
the
raw
grand
jury
testimony
before
them.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
now,
this
was
the
day
5,
this
was
wednesday.
he
appeared
before
the
state
grand
jury
and
nothing
was
done
on
election
day
which
was
a
tuesday,
he
appeared
before
them
at
10
minutes
of
10
on
wednesday.
and
then
the
questioning
started,
and
the
questioning
was
not
directed
to
whether
you
intend
to
resign,
whether
you're
fit
to
hold
your
job
as
a
judge,
and
he
did
not
offer
his
resignation
at
this
meeting,
that
was
done
at
some
subsequent
time.
the
questioning
was
to
his
philosophy
on
the
fifth
amendment,
whether
he
believed
the
judge
should
resort
to
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
it
certainly
does
your
honor.
particularly
10
minutes
before
the
time
he
has
to
go
onto
a
grand
jury
where
he
is
already
resorted
to
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
there
is
a
time
and
place
for
that
inquiry
to
be
made
and
it's
certainly
in
my
opinion
it's
not
10
minutes
before
you're
about
to
go
before
a
grand
jury,
where
you're
accompanied
by
a
counsel,
and
where
there
are
rules,
and
there
is
a
due
process
established
for
the
disciplining
of
courts,
which
calls
for
notice,
which
calls
for
a
hearing,
which
calls
for
representation
by
counsel.
and
to
get
a
man
who's
about
to
go
before
a
state
grand
jury
who
knows,
and
this
is
another
important
fact
that,
who
knows
the
makeup
of
the
grand
jury
and
the
fact
that
three
convicts
have
been
brought
by
the
attorney
general
before
that
grand
jury,
but
promises
of
leniency,
who
have
testified
against
him,
who
is
aware
of
his
testimony,
and
with
all
of
this
on
his
back,
to
be
called
10
minutes
before
he
has
to
enter
into
that
pit
by
the
supreme
court
without
the
presence
of
counsel,
without
any
notice
of
why
he's
being
there,
it
was
not
the
time
and
place
to
do
it.
now
there
is
a
time
and
place
to
do
it
and
the
supreme
court
certainly
has
the
power
where
the
--
one
of
the
points
of
our
brief
is
that
we
have
an
integrated
--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
he
knew
what
three
of
them
had,
they
were
convicts
--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
they
should
not
have,
they
should
not
have.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
well,
he
was
told
by
a
representative
of
new
jersey
state
police,
that's
what
appears
that
he
shouldn't
have
been
told,
but
he
was
and
that's
part
of
the
--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
well,
that--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
that's
one
of
the
points
we're
making
here,
that
there
was
a
complete
collapse
of
due
process
that
the
attorney
general
should
have
never
turned
those
grand
jury
minutes
over
to
the
chief
justice,
and
what's
more,
he
should
have
never
told
his
detectives
what
was
going
on
in
that
grand
jury.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
no,
the
attorney
general
who
was
conducting
the
investigation
mr.
justice,
was
obliviously
the
source
of
the
leak.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
pardon?
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
he
certainly
shouldn't,
he
certainly
shouldn't.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
in
new
jersey
you're
not
allowed
to
bring
your
attorney
into
a
grand
jury,
you
can
have
him
standing
outside
and
you
can
consult
with
him.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes.
but
there
was
no
attorney
with
him
before
the
supreme
court,
the
attorneys
were
not
invited.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
absolutely,
absolutely,
it's
in
the
verified
complaint.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
well,
he
asked
--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
well,
in
view
of
what
happened
i
think
it's
a
very
credible
situation
because
they
did
not
do
what
you
would
think
they
would
do.
say
look,
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
system,
step
aside
while
this
is
going
on,
but
that
isn't
what
they
did.
they
just
tried
to
frighten
him
out
of
--
resorting
to
the
fifth
amendment.
in
fact
the
very
last
word
when
he
left
the
chambers,
mr.
justice
weintraub;
what
do
you
intend
to
do
today?
and
he
said
i
am
going
to
testify
and
when
he
got
outside
the
grand
jury
chambers,
he
was
met
by
his
counsel
and
his
counsel
said,
you
must
resort
to
the
fifth
amendment.
he
says,
i
can't
do
it,
"it's
my
ticket‚Äù
which
was
his
right
to
practice
law,
he
was
so
frightened,
he
thought
he
was
going
to
be
disbarred
if
he
didn't
resort
to
the
--
if
he
resort
to
the
fifth
amendment,
and
there
is
another
very
important
factor
here.
there
was
a
co-defendant
samuel
moore
who
has
since
died,
he
was
called
before
the
supreme
court
at
the
same
time,
and
if
you
recall
his
affidavit
he
had
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
twice.
they
made
him
wait
four
hours
each
time,
and
after
each
session,
they
asked
him
whether
he
could
deliver
helfant,
whether
he
can
give
any
information
on
helfant.
he
said
you
want
me
to
lie
and
they
said
no,
just
tell
the
truth.
well,
he
was
called
before
the
supreme
court,
and
he
was
asked
to
bring
the
criminal
complaint
which
is
a
gravamen
of
the
substantive
charge
against
him.
he
was
charged
with
unlawfully
compounding
a
felony,
obtaining
the
dismissal
of
a
criminal
complaint.
that
complaint
was
spread
on
the
table
before
the
members
of
the
supreme
court
and
they
discussed
the
genuineness
of
the
plaintiff's
signature
on
that
complaint
and
that
is
one
of
the
central
questions
in
the
criminal
charge
against
whether
he
in
effect
signed
the
dismissal
of
that
complaint
and
he
was
asked,
they
discussed
is
this
his
signature?
and
the
chief
justice
turned
to
mr.
moore
and
asked
him
if
he
called
the
state
trooper
who
have
been
releasing
this
information
an
obscenity,
and
he
said
that
he
hadn't.
he
was
also
asked
as
to
the
reliability
of
certain
law
firms.
so
this
just
was
not
a
--
this
was
a
hodge-podge
affair,
it
wasn't
a
real
inquiry
into
the
merits.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes
sir,
that's
the
affidavit
of
samuel
moore
that
is
in
the
appendix
and
i
might
say
that
the
only
affidavits
in
this
case
are
ours,
and
every
fact
that
i
have
alluded
to
is
in
the
appendix
and
is
supported
by
affidavit.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes,
but
there
the
very
next
sentence
--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
well,
if
you
follow
that
through
the
very
next
sentence
is
‚Äúbut
i
was
under
the
impression
that
if
i
didn't,
something
would
be
done
to
me,‚Äù
that's
a
--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes,
well
the
fact,
let's
look
at
the
facts.
he
did
everything
in
his
power
to
avoid
testifying,
he
resorted
to
the
fifth
amendment,
his
lawyer
said
and
so
testified
and
so
wrote
and
it's
in
the
record,
he
was
going
to
use
the
fifth
amendment
again,
he
went
there
determined
to
use
the
fifth
amendment.
this
is
the
record,
and
when
he
came
out
of
that
supreme
court
chamber,
that
determination
has
resolved,
have
been
shattered.
and
when
his
lawyer
tried
to
get
through
him
--
he
says,
i
can
get
through
him,
i
just
couldn't
reach
him.
he
was
beyond
reach,
he
was
almost
to
be
shattered.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
this
again,
i
certainly
think
it
is,
and
using
the
cases
that
were
cited
by
my
opponent,
united
states
versus
knox.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
in
new
jersey,
that
question
is
not
completely
resolved.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
i
believe
it
is,
because
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
knox,
there
was
a
language
that
duress
is
a
traditional
defense
to
our
criminal
act.
and
in
every
case
cited
by
my
opponents
where
he
attempts
to
distinguish
false
swearing
from
the
substantive
charges,
there
had
been
a
conviction
of
perjury
or
there
had
been
testimony
given
in
a
proceeding
which
was
invalid
and
illegal.
it's
our
contention
that
this
proceeding
was
tainted,
and
that
there
is
a
defense
of
the
duress
and
that
defense
would
have
to
be
raised
in
the
state
court
as
a
defense
for
the
criminal
charge.
now,
if
the
remedy
is
tainted
if
the
remedy
is
perverted
and
this
is
the
whole
meaning
of
justice
because
if
the
extraordinary
circumstances
doctrine
means
anything,
it
means
an
intact
state
remedy
where
you
can
vindicate
a
constitutional
right.
now
if
that
remedy
is
tainted
mr.
justice,
it's
just
as
tainted
for
the
perjury
charge
or
the
false
swearing
charge
as
it
is
for
the
substantive
offense.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
because
traditionally
and
i
cite
the
case
united
states
versus
mccord,
and
there
are
other
cases
that
where
there
was
a
prosecutorial
misconduct,
the
remedy
was
not
to
go
through
the
trial,
but
a
dismissal
of
the
indictment
and
where
there
is
a
judicial
misconduct
and
after
all
the
standard
of
conduct
of
a
supreme
court
is
the
highest
possible
standard.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
well,
the
new
jersey
system
is
an
integrated
system,
there
is
absolute
power
--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
no,
but
the
rise
of
appeal
would
go
through
the
supreme
court.
there
were
judges
of
the
appellate
division
to
whom
he
would
have
an
appeal
of
right,
who
have
already
sat
on
this
matter
that
were
in
this
conference,
the
two
judges
that
we
referred
to,
one
of
them
is
still
--
judge
conford
is
still
on
the
appellate
division.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
we
could,
you
know,
we
could
go
over
a
full
resurrection
or
re-manufacture
of
the
court
system
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
the
answer
i
don't
think
--
i
think
is
no,
because
i
liken
it
to
the
conflict
of
interest
cases.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
there
would
be
many
judges
who
would
be
able
to
be
replaced
by
the
chief
justice
to
sit
but
whether
the
--
that
in
anyway
changes
his
remedy
or
the
autocracy
of
his
remedy,
i
don't
think
it
would
and
i
say
because
of
this.
if
there
is
a
municipal
council,
or
zoning
board
of
adjustment
where
there
is
one
man
that
has
a
conflict
of
interest,
that
taints
the
action
of
that
entire
board,
and
i
say
that
as
long
as
there
are
any
judges
or
even
if
all
the
judges
have
gone,
the
impact
and
influence
of
what
the
supreme
court
did
will
trickle
down
on
all
the
trial
courts.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
absolutely
sir,
i
don't
think
it
is
humanly
possible
for
this
man
to
get
a
fair
trail
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
now,
if
he
were
converted
into
a
modern
day
(inaudible)
and
went
from
one
end
of
the
state
to
the
other
to
look
for
a
court,
that
would
give
him
a
fair
trial,
with
a
computer,
it
is
possible
that
he
could
find
one.
but
(inaudible),
the
venue
of
this
case
is
laid
in
mercer
county.
the
judge
will
be
selected
or
can
be
selected
by
the
assignment
judge
of
mercer
county
who
in
turn
is
selected
by
the
chief
justice.
the
plaintiff
will
have
absolutely
no
way
of
determining
who
sits
in
his
case.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes,
the
chief
justice
has
gone,
but
the
influence
lingers.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
no,
justice
sullivan
is
still
there,
justice
mountain
is
still
there,
judge
conford
is
still
sitting
on
the
appellate
division.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
they
can
be
replaced,
but
i
don't
think
due
process
contemplates
that
if
you
search
the
four
corners
of
a
state,
you
can
finally
find
somebody
that
can
hear
it.
i
think
that
the
system
is
essentially
tainted
and
perverted
and
that
there
will
be
no
adequate
remedy.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
no
sir,
because
i
think
that
what
happen
--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
because,
again
the
influence
lingers,
the
personnel
may
change
but
this
is
an
action
done
by
the
court
and
you
are
asking
a
trial
judge
--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
it
was
done
by
the
court
in
a
private
room.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
there
is
no
record
of
it.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
it
is
done
by
--
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
that's
correct,
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
well,
i
am
not
concerned
with
them
with
all
due
candor.
i
am
concerned
with
this
plaintiff,
and
i
might
say
this,
we
have
had
a
bite
of
the
apple.
we
have
made
application
for
leave
to
appeal
for
the
appellate
division
on
these
very
facts,
it
has
been
rejected.
we
have
made
application
for
a
leave
to
appeal
and
for
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
to
allow
a
review
of
this
action,
and
its
been
rejected.
and
its
been
rejected
over
the
signature
of
chief
justice
weintraub
who
is
a
man
that
we
say
is
responsible
for
this
meeting,
that
was
participated
in
by
all
members
of
the
supreme
court.
so
to
the
extent
possible,
we
have
tried
to
exhaust
our
administrative
remedies.
we
went
all
the
way
up
to
the
supreme
court,
and
they
wouldn't
even
continuance
an
inquiry
into
this
matter.
now,
i
say
this
that
i
certainly
feel
that
we
should
be
allowed
to
build
a
full
record
before
the
federal
district
court
to
determine
whether
this
is
an
extraordinary
situation,
where
there
is
autocracy
of
remedy,
where
there
is
a
irreparable
harm,
because
to
say
that
a
new
court
can
be
--
the
harm
has
been
done.
the
harm
has
been
done,
he
has
been
deprived,
has
been
coerced
out
of
a
constitutional
right
with
certain
consequences.
now
to
say
now
you
can
give
me
a
free
trial
after
you
broken
his
back,
you
taken
away
a
substantial
constitutional
right,
now
we
are
going
to
give
him
a
fair
trial
after
we
crippled
him,
i
don't
think
that
gives
a
man
a
fair
trial.
once
you've
turn
your
lethal
weapons
on
him
and
to
say
we
are
going
to
treat
you
afterwards
is
not
an
answer
to
a
deprivation
of
the
constitutional
right.
it
has
already
occurred,
it's
happened
and
i
don't
think
it
can
be
undone
and
certainly
cannot
be
undone
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
i
feel
also
that
the
circuit
court
which
remanded
to
case
solely
to
have
a
declaratory
judgment
on
the
issue
of
coercion
is
too
limited
in
approach.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
yes.
but
what
they
are
in
effect
saying
is
to
the
federal
district
court
you
give
a
declaratory
judgment
on
the
issue
of
coercion
after
you
had
determined
whether
or
not
there
is
coercion,
then
the
supreme
court
would
be
relieved
of
that
embarrassment
and
we
can
then
send
this
case
back
to
the
new
jersey
court
system
to
complete
the
criminal
proceedings
and
i
don't
think
a
piecemeal
approach
and
there
are
other
issues
in
this
case
besides
coercion.
there
is
issues
of
bad
faith,
there
is
issues
of
whether
or
not
this
is
an
extraordinary
case,
an
extremely
rare
case.
there
is
issues
of
--
and
i
don't
think
the
exception
we're
concerned
with
if
this
court
please
is
an
extremely
narrow
one.
we
don't
have
to
be
concerned
about
the
predential
aspect
of
it.
our
research
has
failed
to
disclose
that
anything
like
this
has
ever
happened
before
and
certainly
if
this
court
acts
with
vigor
and
acts
the
way
we
respectfully
requested,
that
will
never
happened
again
and
that
the
rights
of
litigants
in
state
criminal
courts
will
beyond
approach
not
only
by
errant
prosecutors,
not
only
by
overzealous
law
enforcement
officers
lead
by
supreme
court
judges
who
can
also
err.
and
i
might
say
this
that
if
i
seemed
too
brash,
i
would
like
to
say
that
my
father
was
a
member
of
this
court
and
my
brother
was
a
member
of
the
court
system
at
the
state
of
new
jersey
and
it
has
been
reluctantly
and
slowly
i
have
come
to
the
conclusions
i
have
come
to.
i
was
brought
up
to
respect
and
revere
the
court
system
at
the
state
of
new
jersey.
in
this
instance
i've
had
to
allow
my
better
judgment
to
overcome
my
emotion
and
i
have
been
involved
in
this
case
and
i
know
by
the
feel
that
this
man
will
not
and
will
ever
get
a
fair
trial
at
the
state
of
new
jersey.
i
am
the
one
who
has
made
this
actions
before
the
trial
court
before
the
appellate
division,
before
the
supreme
court.
we've
attempted
to
exhaust
the
remedies
there
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
traditional
case
and
that
there
can
be
no
distinguishment
between
the
false
swearing
and
the
substantive
charges,
because
we
are
right
back
again
to
the
remedy.
and
just
as
--
for
instance,
one
of
the
false
swearing
charges
is
whether
or
not
he
is
signed
the
dismissal.
now
the
supreme
court
has
already
examined
that
complaint.
they've
had
a
rump
session,
they've
had
evidential
hearing
as
to
whether
not
his
signature
was
genuine.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
i
don't
know.
there
hadn't
been
substitute
judges
in
the
application
which
was
made
for
temporary
leave
to
appeal.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
it
provides
for
it,
but
it
did
not
occur
up
to
now
as
i
say
we
have
made
two
appeals.
mr.
marvin
d.
perskie
well,
the
all
the
retardation
of
the
criminal
proceeding
has
been
caused
by
the
state
since
we
have
gotten
the
first
effective
order
on
our
behalf
in
the
circuit
court
of
the
appeals.
all
of
our
petition
for
recall
or
mandate
for
certiorari
were
initiated
by
the
state
of
new
jersey.
if
they
had
allowed
the
evidential
hearing
to
go
through
that
was
originally
scheduled
over
a
year
ago,
this
matter
would
not
be
resolved,
but
they
are
the
ones
who
have
taken
the
appeal.
it
depends
on
whose
ox
is
being
gored.
when
we
were
loosing,
they
appealed;
when
they
are
loosing,
we
are
appealing.
this
is
the
nature
of
the
beast,
but
what
is
important
is
that
there
be
a
vindication
of
a
substantial
constitutional
right
in
the
state
court
and
up
to
now
we
have
not
been
able
to
vindicate
that
right,
we
have
not
even
been
able
to
get
a
hearing,
not
even
an
inquiry.
the
courts
have
even
refused
to
give
us
an
inquiry.
if
this
is
not
extraordinary
circumstances
as
these
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
stated,
it's
hard
to
conceive
where
there
would
be
an
extraordinary
situation,
one
extremely
rare
case.
this
is
it,
and
because
it
involves
the
coalecingly
working
together
of
two
of
the
highest
branches
of
government,
the
supreme
court
of
a
state
and
the
attorney
general's
office
to
deprive
and
to
coerce
and
duress
illegally,
take
away
from
a
man
a
valid
constitutional
right.
this
has
never
happened
anywhere
else,
and
i
say
again
if
we
are
successful
here,
i
am
sure
will
never
happen
anywhere
again,
but
it
has
happened
and
to
say
that
we
can
replace
everybody
in
the
court
system
like
replacing
all
the
blood
in
your
body.
once
you
have
a
disease,
just
putting
a
new
blood
doesn't
cure
the
disease
when
the
harm
is
already
done.
i
thank
you.
