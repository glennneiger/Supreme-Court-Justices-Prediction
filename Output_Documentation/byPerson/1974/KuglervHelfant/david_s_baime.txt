mr.
david
s.
baime
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
before
this
court
on
a
petition
and
cross
petition
for
certiorari,
to
review
a
judgment
rendered
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
sitting
en
banc.
that
judgment
reversed
an
order
entered
by
the
united
states
district
court,
dismissing
respondent's
complain
pursuant
to
rule
12
(b)
(6)
and
denying
his
application
for
preliminary
injunctive
relief.
at
issue
here
is
the
propriety
of
federal
intervention
in
an
ongoing
state
criminal
prosecution.
more
specifically
the
question
to
be
resolved,
is
whether
the
new
jersey
supreme
court's
conference
with
the
respondent,
which
allegedly
had
the
affect
of
coercing
to
testify
before
the
state
grand
jury,
constituted
such
extraordinary
circumstances
as
to
compel
federal
intervention
in
the
resulting,
disrupting
of
legitimate
state
criminal
processes.
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
the
material
facts
are
not
in
dispute
and
are
essentially
a
matter
of
public
record.
respondent,
a
member
of
the
new
jersey
bar
and
a
former
municipal
court
judge
alleged
in
a
verified
complaint
filed
under
the
civil
rights
act,
that
he
had
been
subpoenaed
to
appear
before
the
state
grand
jury
on
october
18,
1972.
pursuant
to
that
subpoena,
respondent
appeared
and
was
then
advised
that
he
was
a
target
of
the
grand
jury's
investigation.
armed
with
that
information
and
being
fully
apprised
of
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights,
the
respondent
refused
to
enter
the
grand
jury
room.
he
was
then
brought
before
a
superior
court
judge,
who
following
argument
in
open
court
ordered
him
to
appear
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
to
assert
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
if
that
was
his
desire.
the
respondent
then
entered
the
grand
jury
room
and
refused
to
testify.
this
matter
then
came
to
the
attention
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey.
in
the
interim
however
it
had
become
apparent
that
the
grand
jury's
inquiry
concerned
other
matters
in
which
the
respondent
was
allegedly
involved.
he
was
therefore
re-subpoenaed
to
appear
before
the
grand
jury
on
november
8,
1972.
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
having
scheduled
oral
arguments
on
that
date,
requested
the
presence
of
judge
helfant
and
judge
moore
who
was
also
implicated
in
the
criminal
scheme
at
his
private
conference
room.
the
object
of
that
conference
was
to
determine
whether
removal
or
disciplinary
proceedings
were
to
be
commenced
against
either
or
both
judges.
both
judge
moore
--
mr.
david
s.
baime
yes
your
honor,
i
should
say
however
that
the
grand
jury's
investigation
involved
as
well
an
atlantic
county
court
judge.
mr.
david
s.
baime
yes.
mr.
david
s.
baime
yes.
mr.
david
s.
baime
he
may
not
practice
in
criminal
courts
or
have
anything
to
do
with
the
penal
law
that
includes
disorderly
person's
violation
etcetera.
mr.
david
s.
baime
i
am
sorry?
mr.
david
s.
baime
yes
it
was,
yes
it
was.
the
grand
jury
was
located
on
the
same
floor
as
the
conference
room
of
the
supreme
court.
now
both
judge
moore
--
mr.
david
s.
baime
oh
yes,
this
was
the
state
grand
jury
which
has
state
wide
jurisdiction.
both
judge
moore
who
had
previously
waived
this
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
testified
freely
before
the
grand
jury,
and
judge
hoffman
who
as
i
have
noted
had
refused,
appeared
as
requested.
both
judges
agreed
not
to
sit
pending
resolution
of
the
grand
jury's
investigation.
respondent's
complaint
alleged
that
the
affect
of
this
conference
on
him
was
to
harass
him
to
before
the
state
grand
jury.
all
parties
agree
that
his
testimony
was
wholly
exculpatory.
nevertheless
the
grand
jury
returned
an
indictment,
charging
him
with
substantive
offenses
and
with
four
counts
of
false
swearing.
based
upon
these
allegations,
respondent
sought
an
injunction
in
the
united
states
district
court,
adjoining
prosecution
of
the
state
charges.
following
an
evidentiary
hearing,
the
district
court
dismissed
respondent's
complaint
pursuant
to
rule
12
(b)
(6)
and
denied
his
application
for
a
preliminary
injunction.
specifically,
the
court
concluded
that
the
complaint
was
barren
of
anything
which
would
indicate
bad
faith
or
harassment
on
the
part
of
new
jersey's
prosecutorial
authorities.
so
too,
the
district
court
was
unwilling
to
presume
that
the
entire
state
judicial
system
would
be
innocuously
infected
by
virtue
of
the
supreme
court's
involvement
in
the
aftereffects
of
the
case.
a
three-judge
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
subsequently
reversed.
following
re-argument,
the
court
of
appeals
in
an
en
banc
decision
ordered
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
whether
respondents
were
not
to
testify
had
been
overborne
and
further
ordered
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions
in
the
form
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
decision
calling
for
a
declaratory
relief
ignored
time-honored
principles
of
federalism
and
comity
as
annunciated
by
this
court
in
younger
against
harris
and
samuels
against
mackell.
we
recognize
of
course
at
the
outset,
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
all
reasonable
and
legitimate
inferences
must
be
assumed
in
favor
of
the
respondent.
mr.
david
s.
baime
that's
true.
mr.
david
s.
baime
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
s.
baime
it's
true.
mr.
david
s.
baime
he
has
retired.
he
has
two
decisions
which
will
be
issued
in
about
eight
days,
but
he
no
longer
will
be
sitting
in
cases
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
david
s.
baime
they
presently
serve
in
their
official
capacities
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
david
s.
baime
as
we
note
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
it's
made
clear
by
the
decision
in
spomer
against
littleton,
the
case
with
respect
to
seven
or
perhaps
six,
the
named
defendants
truly
is
moot.
these
individuals
were
sued
not
in
their
official
capacities
but
by
virtue
of
a
conclusory
allegation
of
personal
vindictiveness
on
their
part
and
it's
noted
in
spomer
against
littleton,
those
allegations
must
die
along
with
the
resignation
of
those
public
officials.
therefore,
only
two
defendants
presently
serve
in
new
jersey.
and
of
course
according
to
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
only
one
of
the
two
in
any
way
actively
participated
in
this
conference.
we
submit
in
our
brief
that
under
these
circumstances
--
mr.
david
s.
baime
yes.
i
shouldn't
say
this
whole
case,
because
we
also
argue
that
the
coercion
issue
is
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
validity
of
the
state
court
indictments.
by
that
i
mean,
a
finding
of
coercion
would
no
way
vitiate
the
false
swearing
charges.
mr.
david
s.
baime
that
is
the
way
we
understand
the
respondent's
complaint.
mr.
david
s.
baime
yes,
but
i
should
point
out
that
in
new
jersey,
not
only
has
the
composition
of
the
supreme
court
change
but
we
have
a
new
attorney
general
as
well.
former
attorney
general
kugler
since
resigned
and
so
has
deputy
attorney
general
hayden.
i
might
point
out
at
this
point
that
the
purpose
of
an
injunction
and
indeed
declaratory
relief
as
well
is
to
prevent
a
future
violation
of
the
law
not
to
rectify
a
wrong
already
done.
we
submit
that
under
the
facts
that
presently
exist,
respondent's
complaint
simply
does
not
satisfy
the
great
and
immediate
harm
requirement
annunciated
by
this
court
in
younger
against
harris.
when
viewed
within
the
factual
context
as
it
presently
exists,
it's
quite
clear
that
respondent's
allegations
amount
to
nothing
more
than
a
mere
academic
exercise
and
are
conceivable.
plainly
there
was
nothing
anomalous
in
the
supreme
court's
conference
with
judge
helfant.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
to
initiate
disciplinary
and
removable
proceedings.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
has
itself
acknowledged
in
(inaudible)
that
significant
constitutional
obligation
cannot
ordinarily
await
the
conclusion
of
related
criminal
charges
pending
against
a
judge
or
lawyer,
rather
that
constitutional
obligation
of
the
supreme
court
is
to
ensure
both
the
appearance
and
facts
of
judicial
integrity.
now
--
mr.
david
s.
baime
yes,
your
honor,
we
have
pointed
that
in
our
--
out
in
our
brief
as
well.
i
might
point
further
that
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
is
premised
upon
the
conclusion
that
those
judges
or
justices
who
might
in
some
way
be
unable
to
remain
impartial
by
virtue
of
their
official
involvement
in
this
case
under
new
jersey
law
must
recuse
themselves.
mr.
david
s.
baime
no
they
are
not
unusual.
they
occur
on
the
average
of
--
this
is
in
the
record
your
honor,
it's
from
reviewing
the
files
of
the
supreme
court
but
they
--
mr.
david
s.
baime
i
believe
chief
justice
vanderbilt
was
chief
justice
at
that
time
and
that's
true.
so
this
is
not
an
unusual
practice.
the
obligation
of
the
supreme
court
to
initiate
disciplinary
proceedings
certainly
cannot
be
handled
in
a
manner
--
in
conjectural
way.
rather
the
supreme
court
should
make
some
initial
finding
that
at
least
proceedings
are
warranted.
as
i
have
noted
in
the
brief,
here
the
respondent's
agreement
not
to
sit
pending
resolution
of
the
grand
jury
charges,
obviated
the
need
to
determine
whether
removal
or
suspension
proceedings
were
to
be
commenced.
for
that
reason,
there
is
no
order
to
show
cause
in
this
case,
nor
there
was
ever
hearing
with
respect
to
the
suspension
or
removal.
mr.
david
s.
baime
the
false
swearing
occurred
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
it
was
--
mr.
david
s.
baime
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
understand
--
mr.
david
s.
baime
yes
and
the
first
grand
jury
hearing
in
october
18,
1972,
the
respondent
refused
to
testify.
at
the
second
hearing,
he
testified
with
respect
to
three
unrelated
transactions
after
being
apprised
on
each
occasion
that
he
was
the
target
of
the
grand
jury's
inquiry
and
advised
further
as
to
scope
what
that
investigation
was.
on
the
second
occasion,
he
testified
in
the
manner
which
we
submit
constitutes
false
swearing
which
is
similar
to
perjury.
mr.
david
s.
baime
yes
and
with
regard
to
that
we
would
point
out
that
the
coercion
issue
is
again
wholly
irreverent
to
the
criminal
proceedings
pending
against
the
respondent.
simply
stated,
there
is
no
reason
to
assume
even
giving
the
fact
that
there
is
wholesale
contamination
in
the
state
judiciary
that
any
member
of
that
judicial
system
will
ever
be
confronted
with
the
issue
of
having
to
determine
whether
the
supreme
court
in
fact,
coerced
this
respondent.
the
reason
i
think
is
quite
obvious.
with
respect
to
the
false
swearing
charges,
it's
clear
that
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
does
not
deal
a
witness
who
was
compelled
to
testify
with
the
license
to
commit
perjury
with
impunity.
rather
this
court
has
repeatedly
construed
the
fifth
amendment
is
implying
only
to
evidence
of
past
criminal
transgressions,
beginning
with
such
cases
as
glickstien
against
united
states,
and
going
through
dennis
against
united
states,
bryson
against
united
states
and
only
recently,
united
states
against
knox,
this
court
has
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
a
witness,
even
compelled
to
testify
may
not
take
the
law
in
his
own
hands
and
violate
his
oath
with
impunity
and
that's
what
we
alleged
that
this
witness
did.
therefore,
the
fact
that
--
or
the
question
of
coercion
is
wholly
irrelevant.
even
assuming
coercion
to
false
swearing
charges
will
not
be
vitiated,
the
same
principles
apply
with
equal
force
when
considering
the
efficacy
of
that
part
of
the
indictment
charging
the
respondent
with
substantive
crimes.
i
should
point
out
that
those
crimes
are
conspiracy
to
obstruct
justice,
obstruction
of
justice
in
compounding
a
felony.
this
court
has
often
upheld
the
principle
that
reception
before
a
grand
jury
of
even
unconstitutionally
obtained
evidence,
does
not
serve
to
vitiate
substantive
charges.
rather,
the
remedy
under
those
circumstances
is
to
suppress
the
use
in
fruits
of
that
testimony
so
that
the
testimony
may
not
be
used
at
the
defendant's
criminal
trial.
again,
i
submit
that
u.s.
--
united
states
against
blue
is
directly
dispositive
of
the
issue
there,
specifically
the
injunction
with
rather
the
indictment
with
regard
to
the
substantive
counts
is
insulated
from
attack
upon
the
ground
that
respondent's
grand
jury
testimony
was
unconstitutionally
obtained.
and
therefore,
it's
quite
clear
that
an
injunction
which
would
be
tantamount
to
dismissal
of
these
charges
would
be
most
inappropriate.
rather
the
only
fear
that
respondent
has
is
that
at
some
future
point
based
on
a
hypothetical
series
of
events
which
would
in
all
likelihood
will
never
occur,
the
state
for
some
reason
which
i
cannot
fathom
will
utilize
his
grand
jury
testimony
against
him.
and
we've
pointed
out
that
his
grand
jury
testimony
being
wholly
exculpatory
would
not
serve
as
a
declaration
against
penal
interest
under
new
jersey's
evidentiary
law,
nor
would
it
serve
as
an
admission
against
interest.
and
i
refer
also
to
the
fact
that
we
made
a
binding
stipulation
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
that
we
do
not
intend
to
introduce
the
respondent's
grand
jury
testimony
against
him,
other
than
of
course,
with
respect
to
the
crime
of
false
swearing.
again,
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief
that
concession
or
that
stipulation
is
not
gendered
by
an
overwhelming
feeling
of
actualism
and
the
point
i
am
making
again
is
that
the
respondent's
grand
jury
testimony
in
this
case
was
wholly
exculpatory.
therefore,
the
prospect
that
there
will
be
constitutional
injury
in
this
case,
is
based
on
pure
speculation.
it's
wholly
conjectural
and
certainly
under
these
circumstances,
the
respondents
complaint
does
not
satisfy
the
great
and
immediate
harm
requirement
set
forth
in
younger
against
harris.
mr.
david
s.
baime
that's
true.
i
would
point
out
further
that
here
the
declaratory
judgment
would
certainly
be
as
abrasive
as
an
injunction
for
the
reasons
pointed
out
in
steffel
against
thompson,
samuels
against
mackell
and
the
mr.
justice
brennan's
conquering
or
i
should
say
separate
opinion
in
perez
against
ledesma.
firstly,
there
is
a
question
under
section
2102,
whether
an
injunction
could
be
issued
to
enforce
declaratory
judgment.
i
know
your
own
views
on
that
issue,
but
of
course,
there
is
some
disagreement.
secondly,
a
declaratory
judgment
might
well
have
some
res
judicata
effect,
some
binding
effect
upon
the
state
courts.
thirdly,
assuming
that
the
declaratory
judgment
would
not
be
binding
on
the
state
courts
that
solely
means
that
a
declaratory
judgment
here
would
encourage
duplication
of
legal
proceedings.
mr.
david
s.
baime
that's
true.
i
don't
think
we
have
to.
i
just
--
i
do
think
that
the
judges,
lawyers
and
prosecutors
are
guided
not
only
by
the
letter
of
laws
enunciated
by
this
court
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
the
spirit
as
well.
and
again
we
have
submitted
that
the
younger's
introduction
in
based
on
something
more
than
a
technical
rule.
it's
based
on
hundreds
of
years
of
federalism
and
comity
and
those
principles
have
been
reaffirmed
time
and
time
again
by
this
court
only
recently.
this
court
had
a
case,
i
believe
this
last
week
to
come
down
with
the
huffman
against
pursue
decision
which
again
eludes
to
the
fact
that
we
simply
cannot
assume
that
members
of
a
state
judicial
system
will
fail
or
refuse
to
obey
the
law
they
are
bound
to
enforce.
that
is
the
presumption
upon
which
respondent's
complaint
rests
and
we
submit
that
it's
wholly
conjectural
and
incorrect.
in
conclusion,
i
would
point
out
that
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
a
citizen
is
to
be
denied
access
to
the
federal
courts
for
disposition
of
his
constitutional
claims.
we
have
maintained
throughout
these
proceedings
that
habeas
corpus
and
certiorari
proceedings
provide
a
litigant
with
proper
remedies
for
significant
constitutional
violations.
those
remedies
do
not
call
for
massive
disruption
and
dislocation
of
legitimate
state
criminal
processes.
at
issue
here
rather
is
the
state
sovereign
power
or
right
to
try
and
accuse
without
delay,
we
contend
that
a
balancing
of
competing
values,
in
this
case,
clearly
calls
for
the
application
of
the
abstention
doctrine.
we
therefore,
accordingly
urge
the
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
thank
you.
mr.
david
s.
baime
i
would
like
to
answer
at
least
one
question
that
was
propounded.
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
the
state
of
supreme
court
in
state
against
falco
specifically
is
held
that
the
coercion
defense
is
not
available
with
respect
to
a
charge
of
false
swearing.
specifically,
i
refer
the
court
to
state
against
falco
which
is
cited
at
page
53
and
56
my
brief.
secondly,
i
would
just
like
to
reaffirm
the
principle
that
what
respondent
seeks
here
is
immunity.
he
can
vindicate
his
rights,
if
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
by
an
action
for
damages
under
the
civil
rights
act.
there
are
other
remedies
available
as
well
as
it
was
pointed
out
in
a
o'shea
against
littleton,
specifically
there
are
even
criminal
penalties
which
apply
where
there
has
been
gross
misconduct
of
a
judge
or
a
prosecutor.
rather
the
respondent
here
is
seeking
an
injunction
which
looks
to
the
future
and
again
we
submit
that
the
prospect
of
harm
occurring
or
even
assuming
the
truth
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
in
the
inferences
which
we
feel
cannot
be
drawn,
there
is
no
likelihood
of
recurrence
or
repeat
of
this
type
of
situation
in
the
future.
again,
we
submit
that
respondent's
allegations
as
set
forth
in
the
complaint
are
nothing
more
than
a
mere
academic
exercise,
the
conceivable
and
the
state
should
be
permitted
to
try
the
case,
and
respondent's
remedy
assuming
conviction
is
based
on
certiorari
to
this
court
or
habeas
corpus.
thank
you.
