justice
thurgood
marshall
as
i
understand
that
they
told
him
that
he
could
go
before
the
grand
jury
and
plead
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
all
of
this,
he
just
objected
to
going
into
the
door?
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
going
in
the
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
went
all
the
way
up
to
supreme
court,
to
find
out
whether
he
had
to
go
in
the
room
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
what
you
said.
you
said
he
knew
what
the
witnesses
had
testified
to
before
the
grand
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
that
the
supreme
court
shouldn't
have
known
what
went
on
in
the
grand
jury?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
why
should
he
know
if
the
supreme
court
shouldn't
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it's
evident
that
the
grand
jury
minutes
of
new
jersey
aren't
so
secret?[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
people
just
walk
in
around
told
him
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
shouldn't
have
told?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
court
of
new
jersey
changes
you
still
couldn't
try
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
what
theory
do
you
possibly
have
there
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
say
it
was
done
by
the
court,
i
thought
it
was
done
in
a
private
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
any
record
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
it
is
not
called
action.
it's
done
by
individual
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
those
individual
people
have
gone,
but
the
memory
lingers
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
memory
(inaudible)
