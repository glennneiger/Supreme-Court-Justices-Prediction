mr.
baime,
you
earlier
referred
that
the
third
circuit
as
having
provided
for
a
declaratory
judgment
but
they
also
preliminarily
enjoined
the
prosecution
of
the
state
proceedings
pending
that
determination,
didn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
do
we
need
to
wrestle
with
the
refinements
of
the
declaratory
judgment
aspect
of
it.
i
think
since
the
third
circuit
actually
directed
the
issue
as
an
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
that
strike
it
was
an
unreasonable
inquiry
under
these
circumstances
on
the
part
of
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
a
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
charged
with
disciplinary
and
administrative
response
goes
for
entire
court
system,
can't
ask
a
judge
who
has
claimed
the
fifth
amendment
whether
he
thinks
it's
consisted
with
his
judicial
role?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
didn't
--
they
meanwhile
have
joined
the
prosecution
by
the
state?
