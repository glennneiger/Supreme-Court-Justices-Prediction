and

the

–“
justice

stewart
but
none

--
most
illegal

in
fact
have
not
come

almost
presumably.
justice
potter
stewart
caroline?
oh!
it's
the
caroline
of
cases,
i
think?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
as
i've
understood
your
argument
you
at
least
partially
addressed
mr.
justice
rehnquist
question
by
saying
that
the
court
to
look
to
is
this
court
and
only
this
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
what
judge
hufstedler
said
in
her
separate
opinion
that
otherwise
something
will
be
one
way
in
one
circuit,
one
way
in
another,
one
way
in
one
district
of
a
circuit,
one
way
in
another.
justice
potter
stewart
that
the
only
place
there
were
retroactivity
or
even
get
into
the
question
is
if
you
see
that
this
court
has
overruled
a
long
settled
previous
precedent
or
practice.
justice
potter
stewart
even
the
government
concede,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
that
bowen
was
not
entitled
to
its
judgment.
the
government
quarrels
with
its
judgment
with
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
but
says
that
if
the
judgment
is
correct
bowen
should
have
been
the
beneficiary.
