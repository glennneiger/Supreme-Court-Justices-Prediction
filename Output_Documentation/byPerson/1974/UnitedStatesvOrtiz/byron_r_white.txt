justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
it
is
irrelevant
where
the
checkpoint
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
does
not
have
to
be
within
the
statute,
it
should
be
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
boarder.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
evans,
when
was
your
reply
brief
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
have
it
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
port
of
entry?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
california's
inspection.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
significance,
mr.
evans,
you
comment
a
moment
ago
that
this
not
typical.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
ordinarily
if
they
are
in
the
vehicle
you
can
see
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
to
get
into
why
the
service
leads
checkpoints?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
some
circumstances
i
gather,
the
checkpoint
away
from
the
border
is
not
to
supplement,
but
to
as
a
substitute
for
a
traffic
check
at
the
border.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
there
are
some
places
i
gather,
you
can
cross
the
border
legitimately
and
not
be
subject
to
inspection
right
at
the
border?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
about
at
night
at
the
one
you
just
spoke
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
do
not
cross.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
a
checkpoint.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
a
checkpoint
inland.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
does
the
port
of
entry
perform
any
function
that
relieves
the
burdens
on
what
happens
at
the
border?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
at
the
border
there
are
some
--
there
is
very
heavy
commuter
traffic
at
some
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
border
patrol
people
just
do
not
interrupt
that
flow
of
traffic,
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
said,
if
you
weren't
reluctant
to
interrupt
that
flow
of
heavy
commuter
traffic,
it
might
not
be
the
checkpoint
interior?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
as
i
understand
it
mr.
evans,
could
the
same
car
pass
through
on
the
same
road
more
than
one
checkpoint,
one
at
25
miles,
another
at
62
miles.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
urging
at
the
hundred
miles
under
the
regulation
is
itself
reasonable
in
every
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
gathered
some
of
the
things
you
say
in
your
reply
brief
particularly
on
page
nine
of
the
ortiz
brief.
this
is
in
line
of
what
i'm
asking
a
while
ago.
in
the
case
was
just
perhaps
impractical
to
really
do
the
job
at
the
border
at
certain
point
such
as
in
the
chula
vista.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you're
traffic
control
or
your
traffic
check
you
suggest
here
just
cannot
be
done
without
crating
havoc.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
reason
why
the
line
watch
at
the
border
says
here
in
the
southern
california
area,
the
reason
why
that
is
not
effective
and
you
must
supplement
it
is
just
because
of
evasion?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
understand
that,
but
you
seem
to
think
that
somebody
by
making
a
traffic
check
30
or
40
miles
inland
can
find
something
out
about
from
the
flow
of
traffic
that
he
couldn't
find
out
at
the
border.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
let
us
assume
that
particular
port
entry.
now
why
is
the
border
check
30
miles
inland
any
better
for
you
than
at
the
traffic
check
at
the
border?
justice
byron
r.
white
other
than
for
or
because
of
evasion.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
must
check
even
if
it
is
the
same
traffic
we
would
likely
check
it
twice.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
is
the
thing
the
united
states
has
stressed
before.
i
just
happen
to
run
into
this
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one
was
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
you
shut
them
down
because
of
refusal,
the
warrant
when
you
contention
is
you
do
not
need
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
after
post
bowen?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
evans,
have
any
of
these
refusals
taken
into
account
the
distance
of
a
particular
checkpoint?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
merely
the
traffic
through
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
distance
from
the
border?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
think
that
would
be
a
relevant
consideration?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
there
some
suggestion
in
the
bowen
that
the
warrants
would
not
be
authorized?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
do
not
want
to
read
your
private
notes
from
your
map
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
apart
from
you
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
these
checkpoints
number
six
and
eight,
you
have
a
note
at
the
side
that
not
sought.
that
means
a
warrant
was
not
sought.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
could
you
close
those
down
or
you
still
operate?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
county
of
five
and
five
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
that
the
warrant
was
refused?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
their
warrants
were
refused.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
ninth
circuit
check
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
criterion
you
suggest
for
the
determination
of
functional
equivalent?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
have
been
opened
and
have
to
close
down
on
the
border
then
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
we're
really
saying
is
it
is
i
check
which
in
affect
is
a
substitute
for
closed
border.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
suggesting
that
if
the
checkpoint
would
pick
up
traffic
that
reasonably
might
not
go
through
a
port
of
entry.
it
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
border.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
don't
have
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
permits
that
the
extent
of
the
administrative
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
your
position
as
to
what
it
should
be
known
that
the
space
or
any
other
form
to
authorize
a
non-probable
cause
of
entry?
justice
byron
r.
white
anywhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
depends
on
what
you
think
is
1225,
now
the
issue
to
search
the
vehicle
to
find
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
why
i
said
it
doesn't
really
--
