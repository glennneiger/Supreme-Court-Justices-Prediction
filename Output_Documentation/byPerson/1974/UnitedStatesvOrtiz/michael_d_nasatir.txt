mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
make
the
record
perfectly
clear
that
this
petitioner
does
not
concede
that
section
1357
is
the
only
statute
or
is
a
statute
upon
which
the
internal
--
the
border
patrol
could
rely
upon
for
these
checkpoints.
and
certainly
is
not
a
basis
for
reliance
in
terms
of
the
clear
past
precedent
of
this
court
and
is
not
a
basis
of
reliance
even
under
the
statutory
scheme.
section
1225
(a)
of
title
8
supplies
the
border
patrol
with
the
right
to
search
at
the
border,
section
1357
which
is
the
section
that
justice
white
referred
to
in
the
argument
on
the
first
case
paltrier
is
merely
a
statute
which
enables
the
border
patrol
to
board
vehicles
within
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
border
without
a
warrant.
neither
of
these
statutes
is
clear
from
a
mere
reading
of
them
requires
a
dispensation
with
the
traditional
reliance
upon
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
section
1225
(a)
of
title
8
your
honor
which
is
cited
at
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
anywhere.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no
sir
because
section
1225
(a),
presently
section
1225
(a)
which
is
cited
at
page
22
of
the
brief
in
brignoni-ponce,
footnote
11
is
the
statute
which
enables
immigration
officers
to
board
and
search
cars
in
which
they
believe
aliens
are
being
brought
into
the
country.
this
is
the
enabling
statute
which
allows
them
to
search
at
the
border.
1357
merely
allows
what
justice
stewart
found
in
almeida-sanchez
a
search
within
reasonable
distance
from
the
border
which
i
think
common
sense
would
have
told
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
at
that
time
does
not
mean
that
the
necessity
of
probable
cause
is
dispensed
with.
merely,
reasonable
distance
from
the
border
and
certainly
not
some
45
to
50
miles
from
the
border
as
it
was
the
case
in
bowen
or
some
60
miles
as
it
was
the
case
in
ortiz.
so,
certainly
we
do
not
concede
that
this
statute
either
on
its
phase
or
any
reasonable
interpretation
of
it,
by
lawyers
for
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
trained
in
the
law,
who
advise
these
officers
to
conclude
that
the
probable
cause
requirement
imposed
by
the
fourth
amendment
since
the
inception
of
this
country
could
be
dispensed
with.
and
i
hope
that
the
record
is
perfectly
clear
as
to
that
lack
of
a
concession.
and
in
fact
a
reading
of
the
statutes
or
both
statutes
would
show
that
1225
(a)
enables
them
to
search
at
the
border,
if
they
believe
aliens
are
coming
in.
and
1357
allows
them
to
search
within
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
border.
if
they
have
a
probable
cause,
they
could
search
it
without
a
warrant
in
both
cases
certainly.
every
fourth
amendment
case
of
course
turns
upon
its
facts.
and
in
this
case
the
facts
that
mr.
bowen
are
those
of
every
citizen
in
the
united
states
i
submit
who
chooses
to
travel
in
the
hunting
and
fishing
agriculture
area
of
highway
86.
in
almeida-sanchez
if
you
all
remember
after
he
was
stopped,
mr.
almeida-sanchez
identified
himself
as
a
resident
of
mexico.
he
told
the
border
patrol
that
he'd
pick
up
a
car
at
the
border,
that
he'd
just
come
from
mexico
and
that
he
intended
to
return
to
the
border
on
this
trip.
mr.
bowen
was
stopped.
he
identified
himself
as
an
american
citizen,
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
the
officer
testified
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
had
come
to
mexico.
no
one
had
seen
him
come
to
mexico.
he
wasn't
asked
questions
whether
he
was
coming
to
mexico.
he
was
merely
ordered
to
open
the
back
of
his
camper.
also
in
bowen,
is
distinguished
from
almeida-sanchez
even
and
even
stronger
facts.
mr.
bowen
was
driving
a
camper
which
we
all
know
is
to
some
people
they're
home
on
wheels
especially
their
vacation
home.
the
border
patrol
men
in
bowen
as
far
as
he
knew
could
have
discovered
mr.
bowen's
wife
or
his
children's
sleeping
in
the
back
and
disturb
them.
he
could
have
discovered
and
guess
mr.
bowen
sleeping
in
the
back
or
doing
any
of
the
other
private
things
which
we
knew
are
done
in
campers
including
toilet
habits
or
any
other
private
thing
you
do
in
your
house.
there
is
nothing
in
the
nature
of
bowen's
car,
nothing
in
the
nature
of
his
appearance,
racial
or
otherwise
and
nothing
in
the
nature
of
his
statements
to
the
border
patrol
which
would
indicate
anything
other
than
he
was
a
vacation
traveler
in
this
recreation
area
next
to
the
salton
sea
which
is
a
prime
fishing
area
in
the
southern
california
area.
the
nature
of
this
search
as
shown
by
the
bowen
facts
is
that
arbitrary
one
giving
complete
discretion
to
the
border
patrol.
as
i
stated
before,
there
is
no
showing
whatsoever
that
bowen's
vehicle
had
ever
been
to
mexico.
of
course
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
border
patrol's
power
in
this
case
that
is
functional
equivalent
of
the
border
would
have
provided
this
nexus
but
they
didn't
have
it
here.
they
had
a
regulation
enacted
by
the
ins
itself
which
said
that,
“well,
what's
reasonable
is
a
hundred
miles.”
and
i
think
we
can
all
agree
where
that
100
miles
was
picked
from.
it's
an
arbitrary
figure
having
nothing
to
do
with
nexus
to
the
border
or
functional
equivalent.
common
sense
would
tell
us
that
when
congress
enacted
the
statute
in
light
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
in
light
of
the
caroline
cases
from
this
court
and
without
express
authorization
that
congress
never
meant
to
waive
the
probable
cause
requirements
of
the
search.
and
without
the
statutory
justification
and
without
reasonable
reliance,
certainly
this
case
presents
no
retroactivity
question.
it
presents
no
retroactivity
question
because
it
doesn't
overrule
clear
past
precedent
because
what
is
the
precedent
if
it's
not
the
statute
as
i've
already
argued.
the
precedent
is
merely
a
self-serving
regulation
enacted
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
but
was
this
a
precedent
for
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service?
if
you
will
see
the
record
in
the
baca
hearings,
you
will
see
that
these
checkpoints
have
been
in
existence
since
1925.
now,
from
1925
to
1946
when
section
1357
was
enacted
there
was
no
statutory
authorization
for
these
checkpoints
or
whatsoever.
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
took
it
upon
themselves
to
stop
and
search
travelers
anywhere
within
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
1225
is
just
that
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
yes
and
i
think
that
is
the
way
that
reasonable
minds
would
have
interpreted
that
in
light
of
the
probable
cause
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
this
court's
caroline
of
cases.
not
only
does
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
yes,
yes
your
honor
--
beginning
with
the
carol
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1925.
just
the
opposite
really
is
true.
the
clear
past
precedent
was
carol.
and
an
opposite
result
was
compelled
by
carol.
certainly,
the
past
precedent
was
not
clear
even
in
the
ninth
circuit.
as
you
can
se
every
case
before
1970
in
the
ninth
circuit
not
only
discussed
the
stop
of
these
travelers
on
the
highway
but
discussed
probable
cause
also.
and
each
and
every
case
prior
to
1970
required
the
discussion
of
that
probable
cause
to
justify
that
search
and
they
did
that
in
each
and
every
case.
in
1970,
fumegali
came
along
and
in
1970
when
almeida-sanchez
was
searched
that
lawyer
took
that
case
to
this
court
and
it
was
then
decided.
so
certainly,
the
precedent
in
the
ninth
circuit
was
far
from
clear
as
it
is
so
ably
pointed
out
by
justice
hufstedler
in
her
decent
in
the
bowen
case.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
well,
the
majority
appearance
i
feel
it
was
mistaken
and
the
fact
that
they
mistook
the
fumegali
line
of
cases
as
clear
past
precedent—
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
i
believe
that
a
close
reading
of
the
cases
leading
up
to
fumegali
shows
that
probably
because
it
was
required
up
until
fumegali.
certainly
until
not
the
beginning
of
the
line
of
cases
even
cited
by
the
ninth
circuit
your
honor
was
in
1963.
that's
the
beginning
of
even
the
cases
which
discussed
probable
cause
and
require
probable
cause
in
their
discussions
in
order
to
affirm
the
opinions
upon
which
the
ninth
circuit
rely.
but
not
only
that
your
honor,
i
think
it's
the
final
arbiter
of
the
constitutional
rules
this
court
must
be
look
to
as
the
court
which
defines
constitutional
principles.
certainly,
the
ninth
circuit
cannot
be
the
definer
of
constitutional
principles
because
the
tenth
circuit
right
next
door
might
define
them
different
and
that
would
lack
uniformity.
anyone
who
looked
at
the
supreme
court
for
guidance
in
this
case
would
have
found
carol
and
would
have
found
a
probable
cause
certainly
control
the
statute.
the
ninth
circuit
also
spoke
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
long,
established
and
widely
relied
upon
practice
as
defined
by
previous
decisions.
now,
the
previous
decisions
i
submit
that
were
talked
about
in
milton
versus
wainwright
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
not
the
decision
of
the
lower
court.
but
secondly
of
all,
this
is
not
a
widely
relied
upon
practice.
no
other
law
enforcement
agency
in
the
united
states
but
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
relied
upon
this
practice.
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
enacted
a
regulation
which
i
submit
have
the
drafters
of
that
regulation
of
imprudent
and
not
haphazard
would
have
found
the
caroline
of
cases
which
limited
searches
without
warrants
to
reasonable
distances
from
the
border
and
then
and
only
then
with
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
we're
talking
here
about
the
lack
of
retroactivity
analysis
even
having
to
be
made
your
honor
because
clear
past
precedents
supported
the
fact
that—always
has
supported
the
fact.
clear
past
precedent
from
this
court.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
the
ninth
circuit
held
your
honor
that
bowen
was
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
decision
outlying
checkpoints.
what
i'm
saying
to
this
court
is
that
bowen
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
caroline
of
cases
and
the
cases
that
have
always
held
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
to
searches
well
within
our
borders.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
i
do
see
that
difficulty
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
i
would
propose
first
that
it
would
be
solved
by
having
no
retroactivity
analysis
at
all
by
declaring
that
that's
always
been
the
law
as
it
was
declared
in
almeida-sanchez
clearly.
and
the
checkpoint
searches
are
certainly
no
different
than
almeida-sanchez.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
well
--
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
precisely
what
i'm
saying.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
exactly
my
argument.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
d.
nasatir
no
your
honor
because
it's
always
been
the
law,
that
is
my
point.
and
also
of
course—
