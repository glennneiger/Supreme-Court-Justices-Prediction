justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
highway
86
checkpoint,
where
on
highway
86
was
the
checkpoint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
north
of
brawley?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
is
between
brawley
and
indio?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
heavy
volume
port
of
entry
like
san
isidro
open
24
hours
a
day?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
opposing
counsel
receive
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
checkpoint,
you
do
not
mean
the
port
of
entry
of
san
isidro
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
something
like
san
clemente.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
a
certain
percentage
were
we're
searched.
is
there
a
search
of
the
person
or
is
it
just
of
a
car?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nasatir,
we're
talking
here
i
take
it
about
the
retroactivity
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
bowen.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i've
heard
that
part
of
your
argument
i
think.
what
i
was
trying
to
direct
your
attention
to
was
the
focus
isn't
on
the
retroactivity
of
any
decision
of
this
court
but
on
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
see
some
difficulty?
and
i
would
think
perhaps
if
you
see
some
difficulty
it
might
just
as
well
help
your
client
as
hindering
--
in
carrying
over
retroactivity
analysis
that's
been
applied
in
decisions
of
this
court
down
to
court
of
appeals
decisions
and
presumably
ultimately
to
the
district
courts
so
that
you
have
different
rules
presumably
in
every
judicial
district
in
the
untied
states?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
would
you
propose
that
it
be
solved?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
fine
for
your
particular
case.
but
all
that
would
give
us
is
a
case
by
case
analysis,
not
just
of
our
own
precedents
but
ultimately
of
the
courts
of
appeals
decision
and
presumably
the
courts
of
appeals
are
going
to
have
to
analyze
the
district
court's
decision
to
see
whether
they
should
be
retroactive
from
a
particular
time.
i
think
perhaps
something
more
than
just
urging
that
here,
the
things
should
the
non-retroactive
maybe
required.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that
bowen
isn't
the
decision
of
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
because
it
should
be
retroactive.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
the
government's
point?
