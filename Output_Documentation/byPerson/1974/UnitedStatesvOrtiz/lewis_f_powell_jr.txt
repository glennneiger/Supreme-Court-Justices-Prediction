justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
evans,
in
this
connection,
the
72
out
passes
are
good
up
to
25
miles
as
i
understand
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
am
i
correct
also
in
understanding
that
this
one
of
the
reasons,
perhaps
the
principal
reason
why
the
checkpoints
are
located
beyond
the
25
mile
area.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
evans,
pertaining
to
the
procedure
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
for
a
moment,
possibly
you
covered
this.
looking
at
this
picture,
a
large
stop
sign,
is
every
single
vehicle
stop?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
they
have
prearranged
around
to
the
points
with
smugglers
often.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
the
smugglers
them
to
the
labor
markets,
which
are
well
beyond
san
diego
and
often
in
the
northern
part
of
california
in
other
places?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
are
saying
that
if
you
have
a
thousand
checkpoints
on
this
2,000
mile
border
itself,
you
would
not
solve
this
problem?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
on
the
border
itself?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
evans,
since
i
have
interrupted
you.
let
me
come
back
to
the
legal
problem.
i
understand
the
government's
position
and
that
is
that
no
warrant
procedure
of
any
kind
is
necessary
for
the
fixed
checkpoint,
but
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
court
does
not
accept
that
position,
what
about
a
warrant
procedure
authorization
by
a
district
judge
for
the
maintaining
of
a
checkpoint
after
the
judge
has
been
convinced
that
facts
and
circumstances
justified.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
this
court
said
that
the
district
judges
had
a
tie
to
that
resolve
that
problem,
what
are
the
causes?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
these
three
cases
come
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
each
presents
a
different
issue
concerning
the
united
states
border
patrol's
operations
for
apprehending
aliens
to
enter
the
country
illegally.
in
1973,
we
held
in
almeida-sanchez
versus
the
united
states,
that
border
patrol
officers
on
roving
patrol
may
not
search
private
vehicles
without
probable
cause
to
believe
that
they
contain
aliens
who
are
illegally
in
the
country.
we
did
not
decide
in
that
case
whether
probable
cause
would
be
required
for
similar
searches
at
established
traffic
checkpoints.
in
united
states
against
ortiz,
no.
73-2050,
respondent's
car
was
searched
without
probable
cause
at
a
border
patrol
checkpoint
near
san
clemente,
california
and
three
aliens
were
found
in
his
trunk.
the
court
of
appeals
held
this
search
illegal
under
the
principles
of
almeida-sanchez.
we
agree
that
the
ruling
of
that
case
cover
searches
of
private
vehicles
at
traffic
checkpoints.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
