j.
brennan,
jr.
now
the
federal
inspection
is
initially
made
on
the
highway
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
stop
signs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
mr.
evans
some
of
those
cars
maybe
then
centered
off
to
the
secondary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
i
look
at
the
next
page,
the
highway
86
checkpoint,
apparently
everything
automatically
is
funneled
of
to
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
it
may
as
a
secondary
point
is
there
a
reason
for
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
officer
where?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
the
car
has
to
go
off
to
that
side.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
incidentally,
are
the
later
photographs
in
your
reply
brief,
are
these
photographs
of
the
actual
car
on
the
people
in
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
look
at
this
5
(a)
for
example.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
this
is
as
they
open
the
trunk
or
this
is
the
front
of
the
car?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
5
(a)
with
someone
under
hood,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
of
these
is
62
miles
from
the
border.
are
there
any
further
from
the
border
than
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
are
there
any
other
between
62
and
98?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
put
it
together
why
most
are
within
what
distance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
evans,
could
you
spare
that
map?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
a
moment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
of
those
maps
in
our
courts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
chance
they
were
delivered
in
perhaps
of
one
of
the
cases
rather
to
one
of
these
arguments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
get
this
point
mr.
sevilla
we're
talking
about
--
i
can't
keep
this
two
cases
clear
to
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
one
in
62
miles,
isn't
it?
