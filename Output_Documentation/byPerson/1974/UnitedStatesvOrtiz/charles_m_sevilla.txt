mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court?
i
think
mr.
evans
has
outlined
adequately
the
facts
of
this
case
and
issues
involved,
but
i
would
like
to
address
immediately
some
of
the
statements
which
we
take
issue
with.
first
of
all
in
comparing
a
roving
to
a
fixed
check,
we
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
involved
and
each
case
were
involved
with
a
search,
which
takes
place
because
of
the
unfettered
exercise
of
discretion
by
border
patrol
officer
at
a
checkpoint
who
decides
without
any
criteria,
what
so
ever,
that
he
is
going
to
select
a
car,
refer
to
secondary
and
conduct
a
full
search
of
a
car.
and
that
this
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
no
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
then
i
would
have
a
question
because
the
question
would
then
be,
is
this
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
border.
now
the
government
has
sighted
the
hard
case
for
the
preposition
that
the
fifth
circuits
says
that,
well
all
check
points
are
valid.
but
that
is
not
true.
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
sierra
blanca
checkpoint
located
some
10
miles
north
of
the
border
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
border.
and
we
would
say
that
if
a
checkpoint
is
the
functional
equivalent
to
the
border,
no
warrant
is
necessary
because
obviously
the
same
type
of
powers
would
emanate
for
a
functional
equivalent
checkpoint
as
a
port
of
entry.
now
with
some
limitations
such
for
body
searches
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well
i
think
the
heart
case
listed
several.
it
should
be
the
first
functional
point
of
entry.
now,
in
the
sierra
blanca
checkpoint,
we
had
two
checkpoints
pardon
me,
two
ports
of
entry
on
the
texas,
mexico
border
which
were
closed
down.
and
the
checkpoint
located
some
10
miles
north.
in
between
those
two
checkpoints
was
the
first
functional
point
of
entry
for
all
of
the
people
traversing
through
that
area.
and
i
think
that
is
a
legitimate
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
then
it
would
not
be
functionally
equivalent
to
the
border.
and
of
course
the
border
patrol
recognizes
that
by
not
opening
it
when
the
ports
of
entry
are
open.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that's
true
but
it's
not
necessarily
sold
because
we
only
have
two
ports
of
interest
such
as
in
california
and
southern
district,
one
in
calexico
and
one
in
san
isidro.
now,
a
functional
equivalent
of
the
border
could
also
exist
today
somewhere
between
those
two
point
or
somewhere
between
the
calexico
port
of
entry
in
the
yuma
port
of
entry
where
there
is
really
no
port
of
entry
involved
but
yet
there
are
let's
say
rural
rows
which
are
leading
from
the
border
in
which
a
lot
of
border
traffic
traversing.
so,
that
could
also
be
the
functionally
equivalent
of
the
border
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
that's
true
as
long
as
--
it
have
to
be
other
criteria
such
as
it
should
be
reasonably
related
to
the
border
in
terms
of
distance.
i
don't
think
for
instance
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
checkpoint
66
miles
north
of
the
port
of
entry.
this
checkpoint
in
san
clemente,
it's
66
miles
north
of
the
san
isidro
port
of
entry.
and
i'd
really
take
issue
with
the
government's
contention
that
they
don't
want
to
disrupt
commuted
traffic.
that's
exactly
what's
involved
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
where
some
10
million
cars
traverse
north
from
san
diego
to
los
angeles.
and
a
very
few
as
we
say
a
trickle
of
traffic
emanates
from
the
border
and
goes
through
san
clemente.
and
we
must
also
look
to
the
fact
that
99.9%
of
the
vehicles
according
to
statistical
sample
taken
from
border
patrol
affidavits,
99.9%
of
the
vehicles
contain
no
immigration
or
violators
at
all.
so,
i
think
these
are
relative
criteria
in
assessing
the
reasonableness
of
the
checkpoint
in
this
case.
i
would
also
and
getting
back
to
the
distinction
between
a
roving
and
a
fixed
checkpoint
we've
got
to
look
one,
there
is
unfettered
distinction
exercise
by
officer
at
the
point.
now,
there's
a
discrepancy
at
to
whether
stuff
takes
place.
i
would
simply
rely
on
the
pictures
submitted
by
the
government
in
this
case.
it
says
”all
traffic
stop
here.”
there's
a
border
patrol
men
with
a
stop
sign.
a
mile
down
the
road
interviewer
it
says,
“all
traffic
prepare
to
stop.”
and
then
the
government's
opening
brief
that
makes
illusion
back
at
hearings
where
the
court
specifically
laid
out
all
of
the
procedures
to
notify
the
oncoming
traffic
that
they're
going
to
be
stopped
to
hit.
now,
for
those
individuals
who
are
lucky
enough
to
pass
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
point
officer
and
make
it
through,
that's
fine.
but
then
there's
a
significant
amount
of
traffic
that
is
referred
based
on
no
particular
basis
except
as
the
government
says,
“the
esp
powers
are
the
sixth
sense
power
of
the
point
officer.
in
the
exercise
of
his
sixth
sense,
he
refer
to
some
cars
over
to
the
secondary
for
a
full
search
of
the
trunk,
the
hood
area,
and
under
the
front
seat.”
i
might
add
that
this
is
conducted
by
armed
officers
in
uniform
who
as
the
consolidated
hearings
may
have
claimed
or
not
the
administrative
officers,
law
enforcement
officers
carrying
357
magnums.
and
when
a
car
is
referred
to
the
secondary
area,
one
officer
approaches
the
passenger's
side,
one
officer
approaches
the
driver's
side,
orders
the
individual
out,
orders
him
to
open
his
trunk,
orders
him
to
open
the
hood
and
then
the
inspection
of
the
interior
may
take
place.
so,
this
is
hardly
a
situation
where
the
protections
for
the
fourth
amendment
should
be
abandoned.
and
as
this
court
said
in
calandra
“the
need
for
deterrence
and
hence
the
rationale
for
excluding
evidence
are
strongest
for
the
government's
unlawful
conduct
would
result
in
imposition
of
a
criminal
sanction
on
the
victim
of
the
search.”
and
that's
what
exactly
is
involved
here.
the
victim
of
the
search
in
this
case
was
mr.
ortiz.
a
search
took
place
and
which
it
was
unlawful
after
almeida-sanchez
made
it
clear
that
probable
cause
was
required
in
search
not
at
the
functional
enclavement
of
the
border
and
not
authorized
by
warrant.
nevertheless,
the
search
took
place.
the
evidence
was
discovered
which
led
to
the
conviction
of
mr.
ortiz.
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
the
card
holders,
initially
mr.
evans
said,
“well,
they're
not
the
problem.”
but
in
addressing
justice
powell
he
said,
“well,
they
are
the
problem.”
that
is
one
of
the
criteria
for
the
establishment
of
the
checkpoints.
our
brief
makes
quite
clear
that
the
ins
was
represented
to
a
congress
of
the
united
states
that
you
can't
equate
the
problems
of
the
i-186
card
holders
with
the
surreptitious
entrance,
because
the
i-186
card
holders
treasure
the
card
that
gives
them
the
right
to
enter
the
united
states.
they
enter
at
a
port
of
entry.
they
do
not
use
smugglers
because
they
can
enter
legally.
and
further
ins
statistics
also
reveal
that
all
checkpoint
operations
in
fiscal
1973
accounted
4.003%
of
the
people
who
had
i-186
cards.
it
simply
not
a
problem
at
the
checkpoints,
of
the
over
half
million
illegal
aliens
captured
1973
i
think
something
less
than
5,000
were
i-186
card
holders
abusing
their
privilege.
they
are
not
the
problem.
and
the
government
has
two
problems
with
that
argument.
checkpoints
were
not
established
to
control
i-186
card
holders
because
as
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
rhoa
rodriguez
makes
clear
i-186
card
holders
up
until
just
a
few
years
ago
could
travel
up
to
150
miles
north
of
the
border.
so,
therefore
checkpoint
up
until
very
recently
when
that
restriction
was
brought
on
the
25
miles
but
checkpoint
was
orderly
useless
in
monitoring
that
type
of
traffic.
further,
the
government
has
a
bootstrap
argument
with
booth
i-186
card
holders
because
it's
the
government
that's
issuing
those
cards.
and
if
it
would
be
rather
ironic
reason
to
allow
the
government
to
conduct
this
massive
road
blocks
based
on
the
issuance
of
cards
which
usually
have
a
perfect
right
either
not
to
issue
at
all
or
to
issue
in
a
more
restrictive
manner.
so,
i
don't
think
the
i-186
card
rationale
plus
it
all
on
this
case.
and
i
might
also
add
when
we're
talking
about
the
distinction
between
a
roving
and
a
fixed
checkpoint
that
the
bowen
court
of
course
found
a
significant
degree
of
the
discretion
with
the
point
officer
in
selecting
whom
he
would
select
for
this
more
intrusive
type
of
search
and
it
certainly
not
a
modest
intrusion
for
an
individual
to
be
travelling
155
miles
an
hour
in
interstate
freeway.
perhaps,
never
having
even
come
close
o
the
border
and
then
to
be
ordered
of
the
freeway
by
an
armed
officer
in
this
intrusive
sort
of
search
conducted.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
evidence
that
mr.
ortiz
ever
went
closer
than
15
miles
north
of
the
border.
the
only
evidence
in
the
stipulated
facts
trial
is
that
mr.
ortiz
picked
up
three
aliens
in
oceanside
of
california
whom
he
knew
to
have
entered
within
three
years.
that
is
the
only
time
in
place
nexus
which
connects
the
search
to
the
border
unlike
the
almeida-sanchez
case
where
the
officers
at
the
time
they
conducted
a
search
knew
that
almeida-sanchez
had
just
come
from
the
border.
and
this
is
sort
of
typical
of
the
blanket
drag
net
type
of
search
and
seizure
policy
that
goes
on
at
the
checkpoints.
another
problem
i
have
with
the
government's
information
relying
on
the
ins
provided
maps
is
in
the
first
map,
i'm
sort
of
glad
the
court
doesn't
have
the
map
because
it's
really
inaccurate.
the
government
said
that
there
are
12
checkpoints
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
testimony
by
the
two
agents
who
run
all
the
checkpoints
in
the
southern
district
of
california
indicated
that
there
were
nine
such
checkpoints.
the
government
has
indicated
in
the
maps
to
this
court
that
three
agricultural
stations
located
on
the
arizona-california
border
are
immigration
checkpoints
established
by
the
ins.
another
one
when
located
in
the
tecate,
california
and
number
four
simply
does
not
exist.
and
so
that's
unfortunate
that
took
place
but
the
record
clearly
reflects
that
there
are
nine
and
where
they
are
located.
and
if
i
might
further
add
that
if
this
court
sees
fit
to
apply
the
probable
cause
standard
to
the
search
that
took
place
in
this
case
as
it
should
since
it
is
directly
--
the
analogy
is
clear
to
almeida-sanchez
and
carroll
versus
united
states
that
not
all
checkpoints
were
immediately
going
to
collapse.
this
checkpoint
is
simply
unreasonable.
it
doesn't
come
close
to
meeting
the
requirements
of
a
functional
equivalent,
99.9%
of
the
traffic
according
to
ins
statistics
contains
no
immigration
law
violators.
96%
of
those
searched
at
this
checkpoint
are
not
violating
any
law.
it's
really
a
massive
intrusion
and
sort
of
a
blanket
scale.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
we're
talking
about
the
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
62
or
66
or
at
62
area
and
66
road,
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
it's
not
of
the
person.
it
would
be
of
the
car
area
ostensibly
where
an
alien
could
be
hit
in.
but
of
course
since
ins
officers
are
also
customs
officers
sometimes
their
delineation
between
where
they
can
search
for
aliens
and
where
they
can
search
for
counter
band
becomes
confused.
and
we
have
cases
where
aliens
or
the
ins
officers
are
searching
for
an
alien
in
a
jacket
or
in
a
pocket
of
cigarettes
outside
of
those
cases
in
the
brief.
and
that's
the
unreasonable
distinction
between
the
powers.
i
think
as
a
custom
officers
guided
by
probable
cause
when
he
is
dealing
with
the
situation
not
at
the
functional
recruitment
of
the
border,
associate
and
immigration
officer.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
short
of
a
body
cavity
search
i
would
say
so.
there
may
be
some
limitation
as
to
the
extent
of
the
search
but
certainly
a
search
for
aliens
would
be
unquestioned
that
the
functional
recruitment
of
the
border.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
already
found
two
of
the
checkpoints
on
the
maps
submitted
to
the
court
to
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
border.
and
so,
it's
really
a
non-wanted
inference
to
believe
that
declaring
the
unreasonable
checkpoint
at
san
clemente
illegal
that
that
would
have
a
domino
effect
on
other
checkpoints.
we're
only
dealing
with
the
san
clemente
checkpoint.
now,
the
government's
theory
which
it
brings
to
this
court
for
the
first
time
i
might
add
since
i
didn't
bring
before
the
district
court
or
before
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
there's
a
functional
equivalent
of
probable
cause
in
this
area.
now
justice
powell
is
the
only
member
of
this
court
to
have
spoken
to
the
relatively
unstructured
concepts
of
the
functional
improvement
of
probable
cause.
but
i
might
just
go
over
the
five
criteria
that
justice
powell
talked
to
and
demonstrate
other
court—i
mean
how
the
government
has
not
addressed
any
of
those.
number
one,
there
was
warrant
requirement
because
this
is
the
concept
where
certainly
a
judicial
officer
should
make
the
determination
and
not
a
border
patrol
men
standing
66
miles
north
of
a
border
determining
a
legal
concept
such
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
probable
cause.second,
the
distance
from
the
border,
66
miles
in
this
case
and
the
geographic
characteristics.
the
geographic
characteristics
in
this
area,
we
have
an
interstate
freeway
where
the
commuted
traffic
between
san
diego
and
los
angeles
is
interrupted.
this
is
not
the
--
i
do
not
believe
this
is
what
justice
powell
was
talking
to
in
his
concurrent
opinion
because
after
the
mention
was
made
of
geographic
characteristics
or
there's
a
footnote
to
the
problem
long
the
border
and
that
is
that
there
are
vast
areas,
rural,
desert
areas
where
there
are
no
points
of
ports
of
entry.
and
yet
there
are
means
for
aliens
to
surreptitiously
enter.
this
isn't
the
situation.
here
we
have
a
checkpoint
north
of
the
second
circuit
largest
city
of
california
and
north
of
about
18
other
cities
along
the
coast
and
just
south
of
los
angeles.
so,
it
has
nothing
to
do
really
with
border
enforcement.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
people
who
would
be
coming
from
the
border
on
i-5
many
of
them
of
course
would
have
gone
through
the
san
isidro
port
of
entry.
the
most
important
criteria
that
justice
powell
talked
to
was
the
interference
with
the
rights
of
the
innocent.
and
i
will
not
repeat
the
99.9%
figure
again
as
to
of
the
people
who
are
violating
the
law
when
they
passed
the
checkpoint.
so,
on
these
criteria,
certainly
there
is
no
functional
equivalent
of
probable
cause
and
when
the
government
says,
“oh,
we've
had
a
problem
getting
a
warrant
for
this
checkpoint.”
well,
there's
no
wonder.
they
certainly
haven't
established
the
functional
equivalent
of
probable
cause
unless
that's
to
be
a
really
meaningless
concept
because
if
that's
functional
and
equivalent,
there
should
be
some
probability
that
the
people
going
through
that
checkpoint
are
violating
the
law,
that's
what
probabilities
were
all
about.
but
in
this
case,
it's
less
than
one-tenth
of
percentage
of
the
vehicles
going
through
the
checkpoint.
i've
got
two
minutes
before
lunch
and
i'll
try
to
make
that
time
deadline.
i
might
address
myself
to
the
camara
concept
which
the
government
has
also
sought
to
take
refuge
under.
in
camara,
the
intrusion
was
that
of
an
administrative
clerk
who
went
to
a
home
to
look
for
housing
code
violation.
persons
who
were
found
in
violation
were
not
prosecuted
for
felonies
as
mr.
ortiz
was
which
carries
a
maximum
penalty
of
five
years
per
alien.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
a
matter
of
course
they
weren't
prosecuted
at
all
whereas
the
government
economic
acclaim
to
this
court
that
the
transporters
of
aliens
were
not
prosecuted
when
they
found.
as
a
matter
of
course
they
must
be.
they
have
to
be
prosecuted.
and
so,
we
have
a
strict
law
enforcement
procedure
going
forth
as
magistrate
mccue
testified
at
the
consolidated
hearings.
two
magistrates
in
our
district
in
1972
and
73
handled
7,000
immigration
violations
which
were
really
transportation
of
alien
charges
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
i
was
discussing
the
criminal
investigative
nature
of
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
and
discussing
magistrate
mccue's
testimony
which
is
reflected
in
our
brief
concerning
the
thousands
of
prosecutions
in
our
district
for
transportation
of
illegal
aliens
based
upon
the
arrest
of
persons
by
immigration
officers
on
highways
and
interior
of
the
state
of
california.
so,
i'm
going
to
rely
on
our
brief
with
respect
to
the
details
of
that
testimony.
i
would
like
to
discuss
after
discussion
with
the
petitioner
my
allusion
to
the
three
checkpoints
located
on
the
border
between
arizona
and
california
located
in
the
map,
number
one,
provided
by
the
government.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
pardon
me
that
as
just
as
well.
the
government
asserts
that
the
three
checkpoints
which
are
rather
clearly
delineated
as
being
in
the
health
central
sector
on
this
map
or
in
fact
in
arizona.
however,
i
would
point
out
that
these
three
checkpoints
are
california
agricultural
stations
which
the
petitioner
informs
me
that
an
immigration
officer
is
stationed
at
this
california
agricultural
station
to
check
for
aliens.
so,
i
don't
want
to
leave
any
misrepresentations
in
the
record.
however,
i
would
state
that
this
is
one
of
the
problems
when
the
government
goes
outside
the
record
to
supply
this
current
information
in
a
non-advisory
proceeding
especially
when
one
of
the
parties
is
applying
the
information.
the
government
had
its
opportunity
of
the
consolidated
hearings
to
provide
this
information.
and
i
think
they
should
stick
with
that
record.
with
that,
the
government
makes
a
big
point
about
the
need
of
the
checkpoints.
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
or
not
searches
for
legal
aliens
can
take
place
at
all.
it's
whether
they
can
take
place
with
probable
cause
or
based
upon
a
warrant,
or
based
upon
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
board
--
of
probable
cause
of
based
upon
a
checkpoint
at
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
border.
but
then
in
addition
to
those
alternatives,
the
border
patrol
has
at
least
eight
or
nine
other
programs
which
they
use
to
capture
illegally
entering
aliens
that
includes
that
line
watch
roving
patrols
near
the
border.
the
form
investigations,
transportation
terminal
checking
procedures,
metropolitan
investigations,
and
i'll
stop
at
metropolitan
investigations
because
in
a
20-day
period
in
the
city
of
los
angeles,
a
handful
of
immigration
inspectors
swept
through
evidently
a
barrio
in
los
angeles
are
and
captured
20,000
illegal
aliens.
that's
more
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
by
comparison
in
the
entire
year
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
between
12,000
and
16,000
were
captured,
that
about
a
half
million
total
were
captured
in
fiscal
73.
but
in
a
20-day
working
period,
the
ins
was
able
to
capture
20,000
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
which
sort
of
detracts
from
the
theory
that
the
government
will
be
unable
to
discover
illegal
aliens
once
they
have
crossed
the
border
which
is
of
course
the
first
line
where
the
border
patrol
should
be
watching
with
increased
vigor.
i
might
also
point
to
the
record
which
establishes
that
the
entire
california
and
mexico
border
during
a
typical
day
is
guarded
by
30
border
patrol
agents.
and
there
are
nine
inland
checkpoints
in
the
southern
district
of
california
which
takes
away
obviously
a
significant
amount
of
manpower
from
the
border.
at
san
clemente,
there
are
47
border
patrol
agents
assigned
there
for
a
full
day
activity.
and
you
can
multiply
that
by
a
factor
of
nine
although
i'm
sure
there
are
lesser
numbers
assigned
to
the
other
checkpoints.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
they
have
a
significant
problem.
there
is
a
massive
intrusion
of
illegal
aliens.
i'm
saying
that
there
is
no
need
to
dismantle
the
constitution
to
discover
illegal
aliens
when
there
are
so
many
alternatives
available
and
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
if
it
nearly
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
he
very
probably
could.
but
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
terry
versus
ohio,
any
law
enforcement
officer
can
approach
any
resident
of
this
country
and
ask
him
a
question
“where're
your
papers.”
and
the
person
doesn't
have
to
answer
but
if
the
answer
says,
“i
don't
have
any
papers.”
that
provides
basis
for
excluding
him
from
the
country.
the
point
is
that
there
are
other
viable
alternatives
such
as
the
industrial
checks,
the
boat
and
stow
away
checking,
etcetera
as
well
as
the
doctrine
who've
found
it
suspicion
to
stop
a
car
which
we
have
on
our
warrant
and
those
cases
are
cited
in
our
brief.
that
involves
roving
border
patrol
cars
in
the
border
area
looking
for
suspicious
looking
cars.
and
if
there's
an
articulable
basis
to
stop
the
car
it's
permitted.
in
addition,
there
is
a
governmental
agency
interplay
involving
the
irs
and
social
security
and
hew
which
allows
the
agencies
to
detect
the
aliens
once
they
have
made
it
to
the
cities
and
they're
now
applying
for
governmental
benefits.
and
of
course
the
greatest
deterrent
of
all
would
be
passage
by
congress
of
the
rodino
bill
which
would
make
the
annoying
employment
of
an
illegal
alien
unlawful.
and
that
is
where
the
real
deterrent
rest.
it's
up
to
congress.
and
i
think
that
given
the
significance
burdens
of
the
border
patrol
and
nobody
is
denying
that.
but
it's
up
to
congress
to
give
them
the
constitutional
tools
with
which
to
deal
with
the
problem.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
i
certainly
do
and
i
think
the
record
reflects
that.
and
that
consolidated
hearing
of
course
the
border
patrol
men
said,
“we
believe
it's
a
deterrent.”
but
i
think
the
record
reflects
that
the
fact
that
the
immigration
commissioner
indicated
that
there
are
some
10
million
illegal
aliens
here
today
shows
that
the
checkpoints
are
an
obstacle
but
an
easily
evaded
obstacle.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
well,
i
not
only
disagree
with
your
honor.
but
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
bowen
case
said
that
the
government
i
not
going
to
be
rendered
helpless
if
they
strike
the
type
of
search
activity
that
took
place
in
this
case.
there
are
alternatives.
i've
outlined
just
a
few
of
them
and
i'm
sure
the
imaginative
use
of
other
alternatives
would
provide
great
deterrent
--
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
i
would
say
that's
true.
for
instance
i
cited
in
the
brief
the
statistic
that
the
san
clemente
checkpoint
captures
only
5%
of
the
illegal
alien
traffic
going
through
it.
with
that
efficiency
ratio,
it's
hardly
a
deterrent
to
illegal
aliens
passing
through
that
area.
in
closing,
i
would
just
state
mr.
nasatir
is
going
to
address
the
retroactivity
question
with
respect
to
checkpoints.
but
on
page
12
and
13
of
the
reply
brief
by
the
petitioner
is
the
statement
concerning
the
appearance
of
persons
of
mexican
residents.
the
petitioner
has
asserted
that
border
patrol
officers
using
their
sixth
sense
powers
of
extra
sensory
perception
can
determine
merely
by
a
quick
visual
glance
at
a
person
coming
in
a
vehicle
and
an
interstate
highway
whether
that
person
is
an
illegal
alien
from
mexico
or
a
lawful
permanent
resident
from
mexico
or
a
mexican-american
citizen.
and
they
can
make
that
distinction
sufficiently
clear
to
cause
a
referral
to
its
secondary
basically
only
where
there's
a
reasonable
suspicion
of
unlawful
alien.
if
we
read
the
characteristics
that
the
government
asserts
on
page
12
and
13
describing
the
illegal
mexican
alien
i
think
it
would
be
safe
to
say
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
and
just
taken
judicial
notice
that
it
is
impossible
based
on
an
appearance
of
an
individual
to
tell
whether
he
is
here
illegal
or
legal
or
illegally.
and
in
fact
of
course
the
imperial
county
is
52%
mexican-american
in
the
southern
district.
san
diego
county
which
has
a
population
of
a
million
and
a
half
is
13%
mexican-american.
los
angeles
has
the
largest
mexican-american
population
in
the
northern
hemisphere
outside
of
mexico
city.
now,
these
people
have
a
right
to
uninterrupted
travel
and
not
to
be
referred
to
secondary
because
some
border
patrol
men
thinks
they
may
be
illegal
aliens.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
m.
sevilla
thank
you.
