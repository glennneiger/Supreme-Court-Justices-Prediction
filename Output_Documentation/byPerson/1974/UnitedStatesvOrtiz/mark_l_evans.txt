mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
these
cases
which
were
consolidated
for
oral
argument
is
whether
the
principles
almeida-sanchez
should
be
applied
to
invalidate
a
warrantless
search
of
a
vehicle
for
the
presence
of
concealed
aliens
when
conducted
at
a
boarder
patrol
checkpoint
rather
than
by
officers
on
a
roving
patrol.
each
case
also
presents
a
retroactivity
issue
that
need
be
reached
by
the
court
only
if
it
disagrees
with
our
contentions
with
respect
to
the
principal
issue
and
on
that
issue,
our
contention
is
that
checkpoint
searches
in
the
mexican
boarder
area
may
properly
be
conducted
without
a
warrant
and
without
particular
knowledge
about
any
specific
vehicle
that
is
to
be
searched.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
correct.
it
is
also
the
basis
on
which
these
cases
are
distinguishable
from
the
next,
which
raises
an
issue
on
the
merits
slightly
different
variety
variant
of
almeida-sanchez
in
which
a
roving
patrol
officer
stopped
but
did
not
search
an
automobile.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
it
is
not
irrelevant
in
the
broad
sense
of
the
reasonableness
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
and
has
to
be
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
boarder
under
the
statute
and
within
100
miles
from
the
boarder
under
the
regulation
of
implementing
statute.
i
am
not
sure.
i
believe
it
was
and
i
believe
it
was
adopted
so
shortly
after
the
statute
after
the
statute
was
passed.
the
search
in
the
bowen
case
was
conducted
two
and
a
half
years
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez
at
a
checkpoint
on
california
state
highway
86,
about
36
miles
north
of
the
mexican
boarder
and
a
picture
of
that
checkpoint
appears
on
page
2
(a)
of
our
reply
brief
in
ortiz.
it
was
10
o'clock
in
the
evening
on
a
week
night
and
traffic
was
light
when
bowen
approached
the
checkpoint
in
a
camper
truck,
the
officers
stopped
him
and
asked
for
a
citizenship
and
then
as
a
routine
matter
they
asked
him
to
open
the
rear
of
the
camper
to
permit
them
to
check
for
the
presence
of
concealed
aliens.
as
soon
as
bowen
did
saw
agent
ortmier
smelled
marijuana
coming
from
the
camper.
he
thereupon
entered
the
camper
with
a
flashlight
and
saw
in
the
forward
part
of
the
camper
on
a
mattress
what
appeared
to
be
in
his
words
either
a
bedroll
or
a
person.
when
he
investigated
he
found
that
the
objects
were
actually
two
backpacks,
and
as
he
approached
the
mattress,
he
saw
stack
underneath
the
mattress
kilo
bricks
of
marijuana
in
cellophane
wrapped
packages.
after
bowen
was
arrested
and
the
full
search
of
the
camper
was
conducted,
the
officers
found
356
pounds
of
marijuana
in
the
camper
and
158
bends
of
dream
tablets
in
a
jacket
on
the
front
seat
of
the
camper.
bowen
was
prosecuted
and
convicted
for
the
drug
offenses
based
upon
the
evidence
seized
from
the
camper.
and
the
ninth
circuit
initially
affirmed
the
conviction
stating
simply
that
the
search
and
seizure
were
plainly
lawful.
this
court
thereafter
remanded
the
case
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
almeida-sanchez
and
the
court
of
appeals
again
affirmed
in
a
two
part
embank
opinion.
in
part
one
the
court
splitting
seven
to
six
ruled
that
the
search
of
a
vehicle
for
aliens
at
a
checkpoint
may
not
be
conducted
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause
or
warrant
unless
the
checkpoint
is
at
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
border.
it
also
held
that
the
checkpoint
in
this
case
was
not
at
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
border.
in
part
two
of
the
opinion
however,
the
court
held
that
the
ruling
part
in
one
should
not
be
applied
to
exclude
the
evidence
seized
from
bowen's
camper
because
the
search
took
place
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez
at
a
time
when
the
settled
law,
the
ninth
circuit
was
the
such
checkpoints
searches
were
valid.
the
search
in
ortiz
took
place
after
this
court's
decision
in
almeida-sanchez,
but
before
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
bowen.
it
occurred
at
the
border
patrol
checkpoint
on
interstate
route
5,
near
san
clemente,
california,
about
62
miles
north
of
the
mexican
border
and
the
picture
of
that
checkpoint
appears
on
the
prior
page
in
the
appendix
to
the
reply
brief.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe
it
was
filed
on
friday.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
for
lack
of
--
this
is
the
san
clemente
checkpoint.
sorry
that
it
was
--
brief
was
filled
to
late
to
reach
you.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
is
approximately
36
air
miles
north
of
the
mexican
border.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
let
me
take
a
look
at
the
map
so
i
can
--
do
you
have
copies
of
these
maps
that
we
had
lodged
with
the
court
for
distribution
to
each
justice?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
these
were
lodged
not
friday,
but
when
our
brief
was
first
filed.
this
is
a
map
that
shows
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
pardon
me?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
my
understanding
mr.
justice
was
that
it
was
filed
in
the
court
on
friday.
i
do
not
know
when
it
was
received
here.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
have
been
mistakes
before.
i
am
judging
from
what
i
am
told.
i
did
not
personally
delivered
them,
but
i
understand
it
was
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
is
a
map
that
shows
the
checkpoints
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
one
at
san
clemente
is
right
over
here.
this
is
a
little
bit
awkward
i
am
afraid.
the
one
involved
in
the
bowen
case
is
right
over
here.
it
is
bordered
on
the
east
by
farmland
leading
to
salton
sea
and
on
the
east
by
desert.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
don't
know
the
names,
the
towns,
but
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
is
approximately
36
miles,
air
miles
from
the
border
leading
from
the
twin
cities
of
mexicali
and
calexico.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct
with
respect
to
the
san
clemente
checkpoint,
there
is
an
overhead
support
for
permanent
signs
which
have
lights
that
can
be
turned
on
or
off
depending
on
whether
the
checkpoint
is
in
operation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
that
is
what
is
called
the
secondary
inspection
area.
it
is
also
the
side
of
the
state
of
california
truck
weighing
station.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
not
the
port
of
entry,
no.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
right.
it
is
the
state
highway
inspection
facility
for
weighing
trucks.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
cars
are
funneled
into
two
lanes
ordinarily
with
one
officer
standing
right
behind
the
stop
sign
and
one
officer
standing
on
the
side
over
here.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
at
san
clemente,
the
prior
practice
had
been
that
the
point
officer
--
the
practice
has
been
operated
for
some
time
is
that
the
traffic
slows
down
to
roughly
five
miles
an
hour
and
the
officer
standing
at
the
point,
it
is
called
visually
surveys
the
approaching
traffic
and
when
something
arouses
his
suspicion
about
a
particular
automobile,
he
refers
it
to
the
secondary
area
where
there
are
additional
officers
to
make
inquiry
of
the
occupancy
of
the
vehicle
and
if
it
seems
appropriate
at
the
time
to
conduct
the
search
of
the
vehicle.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
traffic
is
far
lighter
on
highway
86,
and
as
a
consequence
the
officer
at
the
point,
there
he
is
now
--
to
go
back
for
second,
the
point
officer
at
san
clemente
almost
never
says
anything
to
the
passengers
in
the
vehicles,
he
either
waves
them
through
or
refers
them
to
secondary.
the
officer
here
however
talks
according
to
the
record
to
about
75%.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
am
sorry.
there
is
a
small
hut,
if
you
can
see
it
on
the
island
there
between
the
road
and
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
goes
off
to
the
side,
the
officer
there
ordinarily
in
about
75%
of
the
cases
will
lean
over,
say,
“good
morning.
this
is
an
immigration
checkpoint,
what
is
your
citizenship,
please?”
and
after
a
response,
the
car
is
ordinarily
waved
through
although
in
about
10
or
15%
of
the
cases,
the
automobile
is
subjected
to
a
search.
now
the
ortiz
search
which
took
place
at
the
san
clemente\
checkpoint,
there
is
not
all
that
many
facts
in
the
record,
the
facts
were
stipulated.
we
know
that
the
search
occurred
at
the
checkpoint
when
ortiz
approached
in
a
1969
chevrolet,
he
was
referred
to
the
secondary
inspection
area
and
the
officers
there
opened
the
trunk
of
the
car
and
found
three
mexican
aliens
who
were
present
in
this
country
illegally.
ortiz
was
prosecuted
and
convicted
of
transporting
these
aliens
knowing
them
to
be
in
the
united
states.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
i
should
explain
that
the
photographs
appearing
--
the
first
two
photographs
are
not
photographs
that
appear
in
the
record
of
this
case,
they
are
official
border
patrol
photographs
and
we
inserted
them
so
that
the
justices
could
see
roughly
what
it
is
we
are
talking
about
in
terms
of
a
checkpoint.
the
other
photographs
were
all
introduced
in
the
ortiz.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
an
actual
--that
is
an
illegal
alien,
an
actual
photo.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
it
is
not
clear
to
me
whether
they
take
these
pictures
anticipating
that
they
are
going
to
find
someone
in
the
hood
or
whether
they
go
through
some
routine
afterwards.
i
just
do
not
know.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
and
the
next
page
shows
her
emerging
from
the
hood.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes
they
are.
all
the
photographs
appearing
from
pages
3
(a)
through
the
end
are
photographs
that
were
introduced
in
evidence
in
the
consolidated
proceeding
in
the
district
court
of
which
the
ortiz
case
was
a
part.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
baca
was
the
first
alphabetized
name
under
which
the
opinion
is
known.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
exactly.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
they
do
not,
they
were
introduced
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
do
not.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
were
submitted
to
the
district
court
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
as
examples,
precisely,
but
not
particularly
typical
example
either
i
would
say.
this
is
not
the
typical
manner
in
which
aliens
are
apprehended
by
the
border
patrol.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
no,
these
are
the
record
reflex,
that
these
are
the
actual
vehicles
and
the
actual
persons
who
were
apprehended.
as
i
said,
i
do
not
know
whether
they
--
at
what
point
the
photographs
were
taken,
this
is
no
way
for
me
to
know
that,
but
my
understanding
is
that
these
are
all
real
cases
and
there
is
testimony
with
respect
to
each
of
these
photographs
in
the
hearing.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
5
(a)
for
example
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
he
may
have.
i
do
not
know.
they
may
have
been
asked
if
the
were
willing
to
cooperate.
i
just
do
not
know
how
these
things
were
arranged.
this
case,
the
one
with
the
woman
inside
the
hood
of
the
car
was
a
case
that
arose
at
the
san
clemente
checkpoint,
the
same
place
of
the
ortiz
case
arose.
the
same
for
the
prior
page
3
(a)
and
4
(a)
which
shows
a
trunk
of
an
automobile
that
has
been
specially
designed
to
contain
an
illegal
alien
in
a
special
compartment
and
that
also
arose
the
san
clemente
checkpoint.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
these
are
not
parties
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
the
cases
in
which
aliens
are
found
hidden
in
compartments
makes
up
a
relatively
small
proportion
of
the
number
of
aliens
that
were
apprehended
by
the
border
patrol
at
their
checkpoints.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
is
hard
to
say
ordinarily
because
with
regularity
there
are
compartment
cases,
but
the
more
likely
manner
of
apprehension
is
from
the
vehicle
itself
apprehending
alien
sitting
visibly
in
the
passenger
compartment.
actually
the
principal
purpose
i
thought
it
might
be
useful
to
include
these
photographs
as
to
show
that
it
is
not
unusual
and
at
least
it
happens
with
some
regularity
that
human
beings
are
hidden
in
trunks,
in
hoods,
in
compartments
that
seemed
too
small
to
contain
them
are
indeed
even
under
the
cars
as
the
last
photograph
in
the
reply
brief
shows.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
appears
in
this
record
on
a
number
of
occasions
dying
of
asphyxiation,
there
are
occasions
when
in
this
record
when
aliens
apparently
were
either
pushed
or
jump
from
a
moving
vehicles
approaching
a
checkpoint
to
their
death.
it
is
a
dirty
business
and
people
do
die.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
certainly
am.
mr.
justice
white,
our
principal
contention
in
this
case
is
that
there
are
significant
differences
between
roving
patrols
and
checkpoints
in
terms
not
only
of
the
governmental
need,
not
only
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
or
the
nature
of
the
circumstances
in
which
intrusion
occurs,
but
also
in
terms
of
the
amenability
of
the
operation
to
a
meaningful
warrant
procedure.
and
these
differences
in
our
view
make
it
possible
for
the
court
to
do
here
what
it
was
unwilling
to
do
in
almeida-sanchez
and
that
is
consistently
with
the
fourth
amendment
to
give
a
fact
to
the
congressional
judgment
reflected
in
section
287
(a)
3
of
the
immigration
nationality
act
that
searches
vehicles
for
aliens
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
border
may
reasonably
be
conducted
without
warrants
and
without
specific
backs
casting
suspicion
on
a
particular
vehicle
to
be
searched.
i
would
like
to
start
by
discussing
the
governmental
need
involved
in
these
operations.
in
some
respects,
the
public
interest
is
quite
an
analogous,
similar,
identical
for
that
matter
to
that
involved
in
the
circumstances
that
were
before
this
court
in
almeida-sanchez
except
perhaps
that
the
problem
has
intensified.
at
the
time
of
the
baca
hearing,
which
is
the
district
--
consolidated
district
court
proceeding
of
which
the
ortiz
case
was
a
part.
it
was
estimated
that
there
were
about
1
million
aliens
present
in
this
country
illegally.
current
estimates
placed
the
figure
much
higher,
ranging
from
5
million
to
12
million.
out
of
the
portable
aliens
who
are
apprehended
in
this
country,
some
90%
are
mexican
nationals
and
about
98%
of
those
who
have
entered
clandestinely
without
inspection
are
mexican
nationals.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
figures
are
not
broken
down
in
that
detail.
the
record
shows
in
the
fiscal
year
1973
more
than
55
thousand
illegal
entrants
were
apprehended
in
border
patrol
traffic
checking
operations
which
in
that
period
would
have
included
to
a
certain
extent
a
roving
patrol
operations
but
that
was
always
a
far
less
significant
proportion
of
the
apprehensions
that
is
roving
patrols
were
accounted
for
far
less
--
far
fewer
apprehensions.
so
you
can
think
in
terms
i
think
roughly
of
50
thousand
out
of
the
--
it
was
about
13%
as
i
recall
from
the
record
of
the
total
number
of
deportable
aliens
apprehended
by
the
border
patrol
for
the
whole
year.
the
social
cost
of
that
is
associated
with
the
presence
of
these
many
millions
of
illegal
entrance
is
also
enormous
and
it
too
is
intensified
particularly
in
this
present
period
of
high
employment.
the
district
court
related
one
estimate
that
is
long
ago
is
1971
when
nearly
600
thousand
californians
were
unemployed.
between
200
thousand
and
300
thousand
illegal
immigrants
were
employed
in
that
state
earning
$100
million
of
wages.
and
the
group
of
american
citizens
and
lawful
resident
aliens
who
were
the
hardest
hit
by
the
presence
of
illegal
entrance
are
the
group
of
unskilled
or
slightly
skilled
workers
who
in
any
event
find
it
difficult
to
find
employment.
the
court
also
found
that
illegal
immigrants
pose
a
potential
health
hazard
because
of
a
high
incidence
of
communicable
disease,
which
is
not
treated
because
these
persons
have
not
presented
themselves
for
inspection
at
the
border
and
in
some
states,
the
district
court
know
that
the
public
assistance
resources
of
the
communities
are
devoted
in
large
part
to
illegal
immigrants
and
their
families.
we
think
that
the
public
interest
in
the
effect
of
enforcement
of
the
immigration
laws
is
obvious
the
traffic
checkpoint
system
plays
a
substantially
greater
role
in
the
border
patrols
enforcement
scheme
than
to
roving
patrols.
roving
patrols
are
themselves
important
as
we
argued
in
almeida-sanchez
and
as
mr.
feit
will
tell
you
shortly.
but
they
have
always
been
essentially
supplementary
to
the
checkpoints
themselves,
which
are
the
heart
of
the
enforcement
effort.
the
record
shows
that
most
of
the
inland
movement
of
illegal
aliens
is
on
the
major
highways
leading
north
from
the
border
and
it
is
there
that
the
checkpoints
are
placed.
apart
from
the
line
watch
which
is
the
patrol
of
the
physical
boundary,
the
checkpoints
are
the
principal
deterrent
to
illegal
entry
and
the
record
demonstrates
what
the
concurring
and
dissenting
opinions
recognize
in
almeida-sanchez
that
the
line
watch
itself
is
simply
incapable
of
controlling
the
unauthorized
entries
across
our
2,000
miles
of
border.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
farthest
from
the
border
is
the
truth
or
consequences
checkpoint
in
new
mexico,
which
is
98
miles
from
the
border.
there
are
none
beyond
the
hundred
mile
limit.
the
regulation
specifies
100
miles.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
they
vary.
most
of
them
are
beyond
25
miles
in
part
because
in
most
cases
it
is
particularly
in
the
california
area.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
all
of
them
are
within
a
hundred.
it
is
hard
for
me
to
say
what
most
are
within.
there
is
a
wide
variety
outside
the
25
mile
range.
the
border
patrol
agents
testifying
the
consolidated
district
court
proceeding
testified
that
the
--
their
interviews
with
apprehended
aliens
and
their
intelligence
sources
in
mexico
made
it
plain
that
the
checkpoints
were
the
principle
deterrent
to
unlawful
entry.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
mr.
justice
white,
there
are
situations
and
there
is
a
recent
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
which
the
situation
is
close
to
this,
where
there
are
ports
of
entry
on
the
border
that
close
down
at
night
and
the
checkpoint
located
10
or
12
miles
from
the
border
operates
at
night.
now
if
that
is
a
substitute
for
the
port
of
entry,
i
would
say
it
is,
but
they
do
not
--
the
function
of
the
border
patrols
traffic
checkpoints
is
not
to
perform
the
function,
the
identical
function
is
performed
at
the
border.
that
is
a
full
customs
and
immigration
search
and
inspection.
that
is
not
what
they
are
doing,
their
job
is
to
only
look
for
illegal
immigrants
and
not
at
all
for
--
i
mean
they
are
designated
as
customs
officers
so
that
they
can
make
appropriate
seizures
and
arrest
when
their
investigations
lead
to
discoveries
of
narcotics
but
they
are
not
--
or
the
discovery
of
any
illegal
contraband
but
they
are
not
--
that
is
not
their
principal
function,
their
principal
function
is
one
of
looking
for
aliens
and
they
do
not
perform
the
full
inspection
services
that
are
performed
at
the
border
itself.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
if
there
are,
i
am
not
aware
of
them.
i
do
not
believe
that
is
the
case.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
it
is
not
legitimate
to
cross
the
border
when
the
port
of
entry
is
down.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
you
are
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
there
is
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
is
checkpoint
inland.
now
in
this
particular
case
i
am
referring
to
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
highway
in
which
the
checkpoint
was
located
is
one
that
parallel
at
the
border,
wondering
further
or
closer,
but
the
checkpoint
itself
was
quite
close
to
these
two
ports
of
entries
that
were
closed
at
night.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
it
does
not
really,
it
performs
a
very
similar
portion
with
respect
to
those
who
are
determined
to
enter
without
inspection,
but
as
to
those
--
i
mean
the
function
of
the
port
of
entry
is
to
inspect
those
who
enter
lawfully
and
present
themselves
for
inspection
to
determine
whether
they
lawfully
can
enter
this
country
and
whether
they
are
bring
anything
that
needs
to
be
declared,
but
the
purpose
of
the
inland
checkpoints
is
to
determine
whether
someone
has
entered
without
inspection
or
has
exceeded
the
limits
of
his
entry
permit.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
now
that
is
in
the
border
area
of
the
united
states.
so
far
as
the
extent
to
which
the
officers
at
the
ports
of
entry
in
busy
ports
check
every
vehicle
or
check
every
person,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
do
not
think
that
they
check
necessarily
everybody
but
i
suppose
they
have
some
superficial
inquiry
made
of
everybody.
but
the
border
patrols
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
i
do
not
think
that
is
correct
because
the
checkpoints
mr.
justice
white
are
not
designed
so
much
to
get
to
apprehend
or
deter
the
entry
through
the
port.
what
they
are
concerned,
which
is
the
98%
who
enter
without
inspection.
there
are
very
small
number
who
enter
lawfully
and
then
to
violate
the
terms
of
their
entry
permits.
it
is
really
the
entrance
without
inspection
that
the
inland
checkpoints
are
designed
to
apprehend.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
it
is
combination
of
that
and
as
i
indicated
the
urban
congestion
in
the
immediate
border
areas
particularly
in
california.
but
that
is
correct,
in
order
to
control
not
only
those
who
come
across
lawfully
with
visitors
cards
to
control
their
unlawful
exceeding
of
the
25
mile
limit,
which
is
a
very
successful
effort
because
very
few
people
do.
it
is
also
designed
to
prevent
the
use
of
forged
or
elicit
visitors
cads,
which
are
used
very
widely
by
smuggling
operations
in
the
area.
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
checkpoint
within
25
miles
could
accomplish
nothing
in
this
respect
at
least
that
everybody
would
flash
a
look
alike
card
when
the
officer
would
have
no
real
way
beyond,
you
know,
apart
from
a
very
intensive
investigation
to
determine
whether
it
was
really
legitimate.
as
under
that
extent
mr.
justice
white,
i
suppose
does
relief
some
of
the
pressure
because
there
are
a
number
of
people
who
do
enter
with
visitors
cards
to
which
they
are
not
entitled
but
which
are
look-a-likes,
and
to
that
extent,
they
are
intercepted
if
they
carry
them
with
them,
which
they
ordinarily
do
not,
they
ordinarily
mail
them
back
to
mexico
for
further
use.
but
if
they
carry
them
with
them,
they
are
intercepted
further
on.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
do
not
--
yes,
i
gather
it
is.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
is
some
dispute
between
the
litigants
here
as
to
whether
they
are
or
not.
the
record
in
the
consolidated
district
court
proceeding
just
does
not
speak
to
the
question
at
least
not
clearly
the
district
court
findings
were
that
at
the
most
to
the
motorist
is
subjected
to
is
a
fleeting
stop.
we
are
informed
by
the
border
patrol
hear
that
with
the
exception
of
those
vehicles
that
are
referred
to
secondary,
very
few
come
to
a
full
stop
except
when
traffic
is
light
and
they
are
curious,
they
make
--
i
mean
the
sign
does
say
stop
and
they
may
stop,
but
the
officer
wants
to
keep
the
traffic
moving
and
he
motions
with
one
hand
and
then
other
and
generally
waives
them
through
four
to
five
miles
per
hour.
we
may
be
disputed
on
that
point
by
the
other
side,
but
i
have
no
way
of
answering
it
other
than
what
i
have
said.
i
referred
to
some
of
the
smuggling
that
goes
on
with
respect
to
the
transportation
of
illegal
entrance,
the
record
shows
that
those
smuggling
operations
have
been
designed
specifically
to
evade
the
checkpoints
and
that
an
alien
who
pays
200
to
$300.00
for
transportation
to
an
inland
job
market
is
paying
for
a
safe
through
a
checkpoint.
one
witness
stated
that
without
the
checkpoints
the
smugglers
would
be
out
of
business
immediately.
indeed
the
mere
cost
of
--
that
a
smuggler
charge
--
the
mere
price
is
smuggler
charges
is
a
very
significant
deterrent
to
many
of
the
persons
who
otherwise
would
be
tempted
to
come
to
this
country
as
judge
turrentine
found
the
average
per
capital
income
of
the
poorest
40%
of
mexican
nationals
is
in
the
range
of
a
$150.00.
there
is
another
difference
between
checkpoints
and
roving
patrols
that
we
think
is
significant
and
this
the
circumstances
in
which
the
intrusion
occurs.
in
both
cases
of
course
a
vehicle
--
search
of
a
vehicle
is
limited
to
those
places
in
which
an
alien
or
a
person
could
reasonably
be
concealed
and
that
usually
means
the
trunk,
sometimes
they
look
in
the
hood
for
the
reason
that
this
pictures
demonstrate.
sometimes
they
look
under
the
car
with
a
mirror
and
occasionally
they
will
have
to
do
what
they
did
in
the
case
of
almeida-sanchez
which
is
to
look
under
the
back
seat
particularly
if
there
is
something
about
the
trunk
that
makes
them
think
there
is
compartment
there
or
if
the
driver
does
not
have
a
key
to
the
trunk.
unlike
a
roving
patrol
however,
in
which
an
officer
patrols
a
large
area,
stopping
vehicles
by
pursuing
with
a
siren
and
a
flashing
light
often
at
night.
checkpoints
are
stationed
there
and
their
procedure
is
more
regularized
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
decision
that
i
mentioned
earlier
stated
in
upholding
a
warrantless
non-probable
cause
search
of
a
vehicle
for
aliens
at
a
permanent
checkpoint
in
sierra
blanca,
texas.
a
permanent
checkpoint
the
court
said
does
not
have
the
constitutionally
frightening
aspect
of
a
roving
patrol.
similarly,
there
is
less
flexibility
in
the
operation
of
a
checkpoint
and
less
discretion
is
vested
in
the
officer
himself
who
is
limited
to
a
single
location
which
has
been
established
by
senior
officials
of
the
border
patrol.
that
decision
i
think
is
subject
to
important
self
limiting
constraints.
there
is
a
very
severe
shortage
of
manpower,
the
officials
who
are
responsible
for
locating
these
checkpoints
are
highly
motivated
to
place
them
in
those
spots
in
which
they
can
operate
most
effective
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
don't
believe
so,
but
my
understanding
is
that
the
aim
is
to
cover
every
road
leading
north.
but
now,
let
me
take
that
back.
there
are
a
couple
of
east,
west
type
roads
in
which
there
are
i
think
more
than
or
there
are
more
than
one
in
the
vicinity.
i
am
really
not
quite
clear,
but
i
am
confident
that
that
is
not
the
normal
procedure,
there
is
usually
on
checkpoint
for
each
major
artery
and
there
will
be
a
less
often
operated
checkpoints
at
the
less
significant
arteries.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
sure.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
also
have
another
one
if
you
are
interested.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
do
not
--
the
one
that
i
showed
you
before
is
the
one
at
southern
california,
this
one
shows
all
47
of
the
border
patrols
checkpoints.
and
if
there's
been
problem
with
having
the
maps
delivered
here,
i
will
see
to
it
this
afternoon
that
enough
copies
are
supplied.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
they
were
submitted
together
with
our
brief
in
ortiz
and
they
were
lodged
as
i
understand
it
with
that
brief.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
certainly.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
the
reply
brief,
isn't
it?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
again,
i
am
told
as
my
understanding
that
that
brief
was
filed
on
friday.
i
do
not
know
whether
it
was
inadvertently
not
stamped
or
whether
for
some
reason
the
delivery
did
not
take
place,
but
in
my
understanding
it
was
--
it
was
served
on
council
on
friday
i
should
add
although
counsel
were
in
route
from
california.
i
was
saying
that
the
decision
to
locate
a
checkpoint
is
not
one
that
is
--
the
decision
of
a
cop
on
the
bit.
and
the
fifth
circuit
appelee
stated
that
again
in
that
same
case,
the
case
named
by
the
way
is
heart
and
it
was
decided
january
15,
1975.
the
court
stated
that
permanent
checkpoints,
the
commitment
of
time,
money,
personnel
and
the
administrative
decision
for
location
of
the
search
are
all
presumably
such
as
to
remove
to
a
large
extent
the
individual
arbitrariness
that
might
be
available
to
roving
agents.
and
we
believe
that
the
combination
of
these
three
factors
that
greatly
increase
need
for
checkpoints
are
less
frightening
aspect
of
the
intrusion
contemplated
in
the
reduce
discretion
of
the
officers
at
least
with
respect
to
the
place
of
the
search
themselves
distinguish
checkpoints
searches
from
roving
patrol
searches
and
should
make
it
possible
for
the
court
to
honor
the
congressional
judgment
that
warrantless
searches
at
vehicles
for
aliens
if
conducted
within
a
reasonable
distance
of
the
border
are
necessary
for
the
protection
of
our
border
against
unauthorized
entries
and
are
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
indeed,
we
think
that
checkpoint
search
is
very,
very
close
resemblance
to
the
searches
that
are
in
fact
made
at
the
border
far
more
intrusive
actions.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
no.
there
may
certainly
be
if
a
checkpoint
were
established
in
downtown
san
diego,
i
do
not
think
we
could
sustain
it
and
i
do
not
think
we
would
try
to.
it
would
havoc
as
the
evidence
shows
with
respect
to
a
checkpoint
even
outside
the
city,
but
near
the
major
commuter
and
shopping
areas.
we
suggest
that
the
analysis
of
mr.
justice
white's
dissent
in
almeida-sanchez
that
congress
contemplated
the
border
for
purposes
of
immigration
law
enforcement
as
a
zone
rather
than
as
a
line
is
particularly
up
here.
though
the
court
did
not
accept
that
analysis
in
the
context
of
a
search
conducted
by
a
roving
patrol
officers
pursuing
and
stopping
a
passing
vehicle,
we
believe
a
different
result
is
appropriate
here
because
the
facts
make
the
operations
so
much
more
closely
resembling
the
operations
at
the
border
itself.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
justice
white
that
is
correct
except
that
we
are
talking
about
here
is
impractical
to
do
the
job
of
protecting
the
borders
other
than
the
ports
of
entry.
the
border
patrols
line
watch
just
cannot
control
unauthorized
entries
other
than
a
port
of
entry.
that
is
the
job
it
can't
be
done
at
the
border.
the
job
at
the
inspection
stations
is
being
down
when
people
present
themselves
for
inspection,
they
are
inspected
and
they
are
admitted
or
not
admitted
but
that
job
is
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
in
the
border
area.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
am
not
talking
about
the
port
of
entry.
again,
i
am
referring
over
the
border
on
this
side
of
the
line,
but
in
the
urban
area
around
the
border
as
it
is
in
the
case
of
san
diego
area.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
essentially
that
is
correct.
if
everybody
presented
--
every
person
who
saw
entrance
to
this
country
presented
themselves
for
inspection
at
the
border,
there
would
be
no
serious
problem
of
illegal
entrance
in
this
country.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
he
could
find
it
out
at
the
border
if
they
had
a
way
of
patrolling
the
entire
2,000
miles
of
the
border.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
because
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
because
those
who
have
evaded
the
inspection
station
at
the
border,
the
record
shows
move
north
to
jobs
markets
in
automobiles.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
in
certain
circumstances,
it
is
going
to
be
the
same
traffic
that
passed
through
the
inspection
point,
but
in
most
cases
the
aliens
who
are
found
or
aliens
who
have
not
come
across
in
a
vehicle.
they
have
walked
across
or
have
been
guided
to
cross.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
argument
in
the
reply
brief
is
addressed
to
the
suggestion
that
we
should
move
our
checkpoints
closer
to
the
border,
not
at
the
border.
they
are
suggesting
at
one
point
in
their
brief
or
adversaries
that
these
checkpoints
cannot
be
justified
so
far
from
the
border
and
our
suggestion
is
that
we
cannot
physically
do
the
job
near
the
border,
there
are
too
many
roads,
there
are
too
much
traffic,
there
is
too
much
local
traffic,
they
just
cannot
be
checked
effectively.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
exactly,
that
is
a
checkpoint
at
the
port,
at
the
entrance
to
the
country
with
the
usual
phrase
as
port
of
entry
and
that
is
how
i
have
used
those
terms
so
far.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
and
almost
a
100%.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yeah.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
very
frequently.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
as
far
as
chicago,
it
is
not
all
common
for
truck
loads
of
illegal
entrance
to
be
destined
for
chicago.
they
are
either
found
in
new
york.
it
is
all
over,
it
is
not
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
if
we
had
a
thousand
checkpoints
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
on
the
border
itself,
it
would
not
solve
the
problem
of
illegal
entry.
there
are
estimates
in
the
testimony
in
the
district
court
by
the
senior
officers
in
this
border
patrol
sectors
that
it
would
take
just
an
enormous
army
to
control
the
potential
of
unlawful
entry,
if
there
is
someone
there
when
they
try
the
first
time
as
one
officer
says
“they
will
bounce
off
and
try
somewhere
else.”
mr.
mark
l.
evans
and
he
estimated
it
would
take
21,000
men
to
cover
his
sector
of
a
145
miles.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
justice
powell,
our
principal
contentions
have
indicated
that
no
warrants
are
needed.
if
we
loose
that,
we
consider
it
essential
that
the
court
make
it
plain
if
it
can
properly
do
so
that
a
warrant
could
properly
be
issued.
we
have
had
very
serious
problems
with
respect
to
the
checkpoint
warrants
that
have
been
issued
in
the
ninth
circuit
following
its
decision
in
bowen
and
then
in
brignoni-ponce,
which
is
the
next
case.
some
judges
think
that
warrants
are
not
permitted
by
the
fourth
amendment
as
mr.
patten
indicated
one
of
the
principal
checkpoints
in
california
has
been
closed
for
quite
a
long
time
now
because
one
judge
said
that
he
did
not
think
he
have
authority
to
issue
a
warrant.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
is
temecula
which
is
the
second
one
over
i
believe
from
the
ocean.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right.
well
there
are
other
problems.
we
have
found
that
nearly
all
the
magistrates
and
judges
have
been
requiring
statistical
showings
for
particular
checkpoints
that
are
just
simply
impossible
to
meet.
these
checkpoints
are
designed
as
deterrence
and
the
more
effective
they
are
as
deterrence,
the
fewer
the
apprehensions
they
are
going
to
be.
and
as
a
consequence,
we
have
had
to
shutdown
essential
but
less
frequently
traveled
checkpoints
because
--
in
three
cases,
because
the
warrants
were
refused
on
the
ground
that
the
statistics
were
inadequate.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
the
ninth
circuit
is
ruled
that
we
cannot
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
is
post
bowen.
we
did
not
start
the
warrants
procedure
until
they
decided
bowen,
which
held
the
checkpoints
could
not
be
--
checkpoint
searches
could
not
be
conducted
without
warrants
and
then
brignoni-ponce,
which
was
soon
followed
by
decision
that
said
the
checkpoints
stops,
could
not
be
conducted
without
warrants.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
am
sure
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
do
not
know
from
personal
experience
or
even
from
talking
to
those
who
do
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
it
would
be,
certainly,
i
think
the
whole
geographic
situation
is
relevant.
there
is
another
problem
we
have
had
and
that
is
that
the
warrants
have
been
issued
in
every
case
for
10
days
at
the
most
and
that
10-day
period
makes
it
necessary
repeatedly
to
get
approval
of
the
same
warrant
even
though
it
is
operation
location,
the
procedure
of
not
changed
a
whit.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
warrants
that
have
been
issued
in
the
ninth
is
not
a
problem,
the
ninth
circuit
warrants
have
been
limited
solely
to
one
warrants
authorizing
the
stopping
of
vehicles
for
purposes
of
acquiring
as
to
the
citizenship
of
the
occupants.
there
has
been
no
authority
granted
to
conduct
the
kind
of
searches
that
border
patrol
considers
are
essential
to
its
enforcement
scheme
and
these
warrants
do
not
say
nothing
more
essentially
than
you
are
commanded
to
conduct
a
checkpoint
and
you
are
authorized
to
stop
any
north
bound
vehicle
during
your
hours
of
operation
to
inquire
as
the
citizenship
of
the
occupants.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
correct.
well,
there
are
some
limits
as
to
body
cavity
searches
for
example.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
bowen
left
the
issue
open.
it
stated
we
do
not
have
to
reach
that
issue
much
as
this
court
left
it
open
in
almeida-sanchez,
but
there
have
been
as
i
have
said,
we
have
lost
the
checkpoint
in
essential
district.
that
is
actually
an
essential
district
although
it
was
treated
in
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
okay.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
have
no
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
the
map.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
exactly.
now
i
was
going
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
those
have
been
closed
down
and
the
reason
they
were
closed
down
and
there
are
–
i
forgot
the
number
now,
i
have
the
total
number
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
are
total
of
six
warrants
in
the
checkpoints
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
have
been
shut
down
because
the
responsible
officials
and
the
united
states
attorney
felt
that
there
was
not
an
adequate
showing
to
make
to
the
magistrates
to
meet
the
requirements
they
had
established.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
warrant
was
not
refused
but
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
and
warrants
were
refused
in
another
four.
one
of
which
was
in
the
ground
that
it
was
improper
grant
such
a
warrant
and
the
other
three
were
on
the
ground
that
it
was
–
there
was
an
adequate
showing.
in
nine
of
the
checkpoints,
generally
the
largest
and
most
important
i
would
say
here,
there
have
been
warrants
issued
for
nine
of
them
and
they
have
been
continuous
more
or
less,
but
of
course
with
roughly
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
pardon
me?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
these
are
all
ninth
circuit.
now
in
the
fifth
and
tenth
circuits,
the
checkpoints
have
been
operated
without
warrants
pursuant
to
the
procedure
that
it
have
been
followed
in
the
past
because
those
circuits
have
up
until
recent,
the
fifth
circuit
had
not
ruled
on
it.
it
is
now
a
rule
that
permanent
checkpoints
are
lawful.
at
least
upheld
one
and
its
decision
can
certainly
be
read
broadly
enough
to
hold
the
rest.
and
the
tenth
circuit
while
it
held
in
king
and
madocks
that
the
principles
of
almeida-sanchez
should
apply
to
checkpoints.
what
it
said
in
essence
was
that
you
can
not
conduct
a
checkpoint
search
without
warrant,
without
probable
cause
unless
that
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
border.
it
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
define
that
term
which
it
did
not
attempt
to
do
and
that
was
the
98
mile
from
the
border
checkpoint
involved,
and
so
at
least
that
circuit
is
completely
open.
we
have
not
contended
for
that
definition
of
functional
equivalent
here.
we
think
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
read
that
phrase,
but
at
least
that
circuit
has
not
ruled
that
that
checkpoint
or
the
others
within
it
are
unlawfully
operating.
so
we
have
been
operating
them
without
warrants.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
it's
not
the
government's
point.
well,
the
government's
point
is
because
bowen
was
the
litigant
in
the
ninth
circuit.
and
because
the
ninth
circuit
decided
the
bowen
case
that
that
should
be
the
basis
for
all
decisions
in
the
ninth
circuit.
i
submit
certainly
if
that
is
the
judgment
of
this
court
that
certainly
bowen
should
receive
the
benefit.
but
of
course
if
the
judgment
of
this
court
that
bowen
is
decided
today
nationwide
then
bowen
should
also
receive
the
benefit
of
that
decision.
but
what
i'm
really
urging
is
that
bowen
should
receive
the
benefit
not
of
this
decision,
not
only
for
those
two
reasons
but
also
for
the
reason
that
bowen
is
the
beneficiary
of
this
court's
first
opportunity
to
review
border
checkpoint
cases
in
the
light
of
its
past
decisions
under
carol.
and
i
think
under
all
three
of
those
focuses
of
analysis,
bowen
gets
the
benefit
of
this
decision.
once
more
in
the
retroactivity
analysis,
i
think
what
you're
also
looking
at
is
reasonable
reliance.
the
ninth
circuit
made
a
big
point
of
the
fact
that
the
ins
relied
upon
ninth
circuit
opinions.
i've
already
pointed
out
that
from
1925
to
1946
the
ins
relied
on
nothing,
not
statute,
not
decision,
nothing
to
establish
these
checkpoints.
it's
also
pointed
out
at
page
74
of
the
brief
and
i
believe
the
brief
in
ortiz
that
the
ins
stopped
and
searched
a
citizen
one
month
after
the
bowen
decision
was
decided
in
the
ninth
circuit
outlying
that
very
practice
without
a
warrant
and
without
probable
cause.
that's
on
page
74
of
the
ortiz
brief.
so,
certainly
they're
not
relying
on
the
ninth
circuit
either
for
the
prior
justification
before
the
statue
or
for
the
subsequent
justification.
the
ins
is
just
stopping
and
searching
people
without
authority
or
certainly
not
relying
upon
the
ninth
circuit.
if
it
could
be
argued,
the
ins
stopped
sanchez
pedroza
which
is
the
case
a
month
after
bowen
was
decided
in
the
ninth
circuit.
if
it's
argued
that
way,
then
of
course
they're
waiting
for
this
court
to
decide
bowen
finally
and
that
would
show
that
they
originally
should
have
looked
to
the
carol
decision
in
making
their
judgments
and
drafting
the
regulations.
the
point
is
made
in
the
amicus
brief
your
honor
that
this
case
should
be
decided
not
on
a
retroactivity
analysis
for
another
reason,
that
this
court
should
control
the
applicability
of
its
constitutional
decisions.
and
i
think
that's
a
very,
very
important
point
because
what
you're
deterring
here
by
that
kind
of
analysis
is
future
drafting
of
regulations
in
a
haphazard
manner.
what
you're
encouraging
by
that
kind
of
analysis
is
the
drafting
of
regulations
carefully
and
prudently
looking
at
all
the
law
especially
including
the
laws
announced
by
this
court.
had
that
been
done
by
the
persons
and
why
not
looking
at
law
enforcement
just
--
you
noted
reasonable
reliance
by
law
enforcement
officers.
that's
not
all
you're
deterring
in
this
case.
the
only
authority
for
these
officers
to
conduct
this
search
was
a
regulation
drafted
by
their
own
people
at
the
ins.
what
you
are
deterring
and
would
be
deterring
in
the
future
by
a
non-retroactivity
analysis
and
deciding
whether
retroactivity
applies
on
a
case-by-case
basis
is
careful,
prudent,
drafting
of
regulations
which
guides
this
law
enforcement
officers.
and
i
think
that's
a
practice
you
want
to
encourage
and
i
think
a
practice
you
want
to
deter
is
haphazard
drafting
without
research
or
without
authority.
even
under
the
traditional
retroactivity
analysis
this
case
differs
from
the
prior
court's
decisions.
this
case
will
not
have
nationwide
application
as
all
of
the
other
cases
where
non-retroactivity
was
ordered.
this
case
deals
with
the
ins,
the
ins
only.
the
smallness
of
that
law
enforcement
agency
is
well
apparent
from
the
government's
briefs
and
from
the
petitioner's
briefs
and
all
of
these
cases.
nor
will
it
disrupt
state,
local
and
federal
courts
all
over
the
country
or
law
enforcement
authorities.
certainly,
this
analysis
would
aid
in
that
conclusion.
and
aids
you
to
see
that
this
in
the
first
instance
is
not
a
retroactivity
case
because
at
the
prior
law
of
this
court.
and
second,
that
even
if
you
consider
it
under
the
traditional
analysis,
the
extent
of
the
reliance
is
much
smaller.
the
effect
on
courts
and
administration
of
justice
is
much
smaller.
and
certainly
no
one
can
say
that
this
is
reasonable
reliance
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
on
clear
past
practice.
your
case
is
on
retroactivity
as
i
see
it
falling
into
two
categories,
number
one,
where
you've
overruled
cases
like
rabinotwitz
and
goldman
and
one
of
your
retroactivity
cases.
but
number
two,
where
you've
ordered
law
enforcement
officers
to
do
something
that
they
have
never
been
required
to
do
before
such
as
miranda.
you've
got
to
give
warnings
now
as
what
you've
said
in
certain
cases.
and
neither
of
those
cases
--
those
two
types
of
cases
has
anything
to
do
with
this
situation
where
as
we‘ve
already
pointed
out
clear
law
did
not
support
the
regulations
issued
by
the
justice
department
nor
did
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute.
and
as
i
say
when
you
talk
about
law
enforcement
in
a
situation
like
this,
you're
talking
about
not
only
the
officer
in
the
field
but
those
who
are
advising
him.
