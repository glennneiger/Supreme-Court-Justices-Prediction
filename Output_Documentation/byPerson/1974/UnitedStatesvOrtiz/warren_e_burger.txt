chief

we
will
hear
argument
next
in
73-2050
and
6848
consolidated.
that
is
united
states
against
ortiz
and
bowen
against
the
united
states.
mr.
evans,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
without
regard
to
the
location
of
the
checkpoint,
the
fixed
checkpoint?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
factor
in
which
these
two
cases
are
distinguishable
from
the
one
just
argued.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
when
you
described
this
as
a
fixed
checkpoint,
the
signs
in
the
arch
over
the
highway
are
permanent
more
or
less,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
in
one
of
these
records
or
in
the
record
of
some
other
cases
that
i
am
recalling
that
some
has
not
been
unknown
that
some
persons
being
smuggled
in
died
from
suffocation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
kind
of
a
warrant
are
you
referring
to
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
there
is
no
suggestion
from
the
ninth
circuit
of
appeals
that
you
need
anything
in
the
nature
of
a
warrant
for
the
port
of
entry,
stop,
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
complete
search.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
evans.
mr.
sevilla.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
are
searches
which
you
would
stop
sign
searches
which
you
would
consider
lawful
at
the
port
of
entry,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they
are
10
miles
or
20
miles
or
30
miles
interior,
then
they
require
a
warrant
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
wherever
it
is
the
functional
equivalent
he
needs
and
he
may
make
any
search
without
a
warrant
short
of
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
right
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sevilla?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
that
is
of
the
total
entrance
is
that,
would
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
from
what
you're
saying
now
and
what
you
have
in
your
briefs
and
other
briefs
on
this
court
i
think
that
you
think
they
aren't
doing
their
job
very
well?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
they
go
through
the
barrio
presumably
it's
a
grand
sweep,
a
drag
net.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
an
alien
move
to
suppress
the
evidence
of
this
illegal
presence
in
the
country
by
a
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
was
ceased
in
an
illegal
search?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
sevilla,
mr.
nasatir?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
believe
your
time
is
entirely
used
up
mr.
evans.
mr.
sevilla
and
mr.
nasatir

accepted
your

you

to
the

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
we
proceed
with
your
case
mr.
feit.
i
want
to
remedy
an
oversight.
i
did
not

shapiro
for
his
assistance
to
the
court
and
to
his
client
because

of
the
