before

at

(a)
of
the
petition
for
the
writ
in
which
the
district
judge
said
“the
primary
reason
for
their
operation
that

a
checkpoint
is
that
they
effectively
deter
life's
numbers
of
aliens
from
illegally
entering
the
country.”

that
finding?

justice
harry
a.
blackmun

a
substantial
number
of
votes
of
the
present
circuit
judges

other
way.
