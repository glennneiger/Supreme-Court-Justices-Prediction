justice
potter
stewart
how
long
they
had
been
in
hartford,
have
they
been
in
hartford
the
whole
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
they
entered
--
justice
potter
stewart
from
mexico,
did
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
does
the
record
show
what
brought
them
up
to
new
england?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
there's
no
official
contemporaneous
record
of
that
is
there
because
that
would
just
be
an
oral
representation?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
what
we
have
is
their
--
is
their
statement
that
that
is
what
they
announced
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
that
is
in
fact
how
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
entered
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
--
that's
the
errico
case,
isn't
it?
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
were
on
that
track
on
the
area
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
was
a
dissenting
opinion
that
was
or
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion
that
said
that
otherwise
admissible
meant
more
than
the
--
meant
more
than
what
the
court
decided
there.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
statute
does
not
cover
those
smuggled
in?
justice
potter
stewart
those
who
get
in
surreptitiously
and
that's
the
very
large
group
available
in
this
entry.
justice
potter
stewart
you
obtained
an
entry
by
fraud.
justice
potter
stewart
was.
was,
is
what
you
want
because
everything
else
is
in
the
past
tense.
your
strongest
argument
is
that
everything
else
is
in
the
past
tense.
they
were
--
they
were
excludable
at
the
time
of
entry
or
have
procured
visas
or
other
document.
see,
it's
a
--
if
its
talking
about
the
time
of
entry,
its
in
the
past
tense
or
the
perfect
tense
and
this
is
in
the
present
tense
and
statute
--
and
the
statutory
provision
has
to
do
with
deportation
of
aliens
within
the
united
states
and
since
this
is
the
present
tense,
it
would
seem
to
view
and
argued
that
it
means
now,
they
have
spouses
or
children
who
are
citizens.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
talking
to
the
time
of
entry
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
lets
try
the
provision,
it's
always
either
in
the
past
tense
or
the
perfect
tense,
not
in
the
present
tense.
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
what
--
i
know
what
you
feel
the
meaning
is
and
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
make
it
mean
what
the
chief
justice
suggested
might
mean,
you
would
argue
that
the
“is”
would
have
to
be
a
“was.”
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
the
finding
is
that
they
procured
their
entry
by
falsely
claiming
to
be
united
states
citizens.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
doesn't
mean
surreptitiously
swimming
or
car
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
means
by
--
they
entered
by
way
of
that
false
claim.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
because
there's
no
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
necessary
implication
of
these
finding
is
what
he
did
find?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
--
certainly
your
argument
is
valid
that
there
is
no
contemporaneous
record
of
that
since
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
oral
at
the
border,
you
just
at
the
canadian,
the
mexican
border
and
therefore
when
these
people
get
here,
all
you
have
is
their
say
so.
justice
potter
stewart
and
therefore
somebody
who
might
in
fact
have
swam
across
or
waited
across
the
river
could
later
say
well
i
didn't
do
that
bridge,
i
got
here
by
falsely
claiming
i
was
a
citizen
and
that
is
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
so
all
we
have
is
there
say
so?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
they
were
not
otherwise
admissible?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
saying
they
don't
--
so
you're
saying
there's
no
way
to
know
--
justice
potter
stewart
whether
they
are
otherwise
admissible?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
in
the
errico
case,
it
wasn't
that
there
was
no
way
to
know
that
they
were
otherwise
admissible,
there
was
a
way
to
know
and
the
fact
is
they
were
not
otherwise
admissible
and
yet
the
court
held
the
statute
applied
to
them.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
was
clear
that
they
were
not
within
the
quota
and
they
were
not
otherwise
admissible.
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
that
they
were
not
otherwise
admissible?
justice
potter
stewart
no
i'm
not
either
but
i'm
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
agreeing
or
disagreeing
or
you're
saying
what
the
hell.
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
two
companion
cases
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
went
on
--
went
into
a
fraudulent
marriage.
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
--
that
was
not
the
errico
case,
there
were
two
companion
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
one
mr.
5347
occupational.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
errico
misrepresented
his
occupational
skills?
justice
potter
stewart
he
said
he
was
a
skilled
mechanic
on
foreign
automobile?
justice
potter
stewart
and
thereby
got
himself
qualified
and
entered.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
companion
case,
the
woman
in
that
case
went
through
a
fraudulent
marriage
with
an
american
citizen
and
she
never
saw
him
again
after
the
ceremony.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
she
got
into
this
country
and
then
very
soon
thereafter
had
an
illegitimate
baby
and
now
therefore,
she
had
a
--
she
was
related
to
that
baby
who
was
born
in
the
united
states
and
therefore
she
was
related
to
the
united
states
citizen
and
the
court
held
she
could
not
be
deported
despite
the
fact
of
her
fraudulent
entry.
that's
correct,
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
those
are
the
facts
of
those
cases.
justice
potter
stewart
she
was
a
wife
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
whether
she
had
a
communicable
disease
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
prison
record
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
mental
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
different
disqualification.
justice
potter
stewart
tell
me
they
--
its
only
if
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
and
which
means
they
have
to
have
close
relatives
who
are
united
states
citizen.
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
everybody,
it
will
just
--
they'd
have
to
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
close
relatives
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
who
are
united
states
citizens.
justice
potter
stewart
so
all
of
these
arguments
or
most
of
them
were
made
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
errico
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
appears
to
me
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion
and
as
i
have
said
before
up
here,
i
had
a
professor
at
law
school
that
used
to
tell
that
dissenting
opinions
were
subversive
literature.
