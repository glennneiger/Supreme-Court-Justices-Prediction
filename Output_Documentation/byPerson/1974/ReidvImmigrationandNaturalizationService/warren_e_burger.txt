we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1541,
reid
against
the
immigration
service.oo
mr.
globman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
they
ever
report
to
the
immigration
service
their
true
status
from
the
time
they
entered
until
the
time
this
litigation
arose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
they
had
two
children?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
is
the
date?
do
you
remember
the
date
when
they
presented?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
three
or
four
years?
three
or
four
years
after
their
entry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
if
they
had
disclosed
at
that
time
that
they
were
citizens,
british
citizens
of
honduras,
then
what
would
have
happened
to
them
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
to
go
back
to
the
consul
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
honduras
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
try
to
get
a
visa?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
definitely
show
that
they
either
had
employment
assured
here
or
that
they
had
means
of
support
here
and
a
great
many
other
things
will
have
to
be
demonstrated,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
are
the
two
cases
parallel
in
terms
of
the
quota
aspects?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
parallel
or
the
same
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
had
indicated
in
your
earlier
response
that
for
all
tactical
purposes
they
could
never
have
been
admitted
to
the
united
states
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
fraud?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
that's
all
been
bypassed
here.
there
is
no
probable
about
credibility
here
as
you
conceded
that
your
clients
got
in
by
falsely
representing
that
they
were
american
citizens?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
how
does
credibility
come
into
play
in
a
situation
like
this
or
the
hypothetical
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
dictated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
voluntarily
however,
it
is
done
to
the
compulsion
of
being
deported
if
he
doesn't
do
some
explaining?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
going
back
to
this
language
that
someone
else
asked
about
and
following
the
exact
language
of
the
statute,
241
(f)
shall
not
apply
to
an
alien
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry
who
is
the
spouse.
well,
do
you
say
that
it
cannot
be
read
as
meaning
that
he
was
the
--
is
the
spouse,
parent
or
child
of
the
citizen
at
the
time
of
the
entry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
speaking
about
the
language
of
the
statute
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
its
understandable
that
a
person
might
have
a
parent
in
the
united
states
or
a
child
in
the
united
states
and
come
from
another
country,
present
himself
for
admission
and
be
otherwise
admissible
in
all
respects
but
at
the
very
time
that
the
misrepresentation
is
made
of
this
qualifying
condition
of
having
parent
or
child
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
on
the
other
side,
on
our
side
of
the
border.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you've
got
at
the
time
of
entry
just
preceding
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you're
going
to
--
you
say
it
should
be
repeated
again.
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry,
who
is
at
the
time
of
entry,
you
would
want
that
repeated
again
to
have
the
meaning
that
i
suggest.
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
read
somewhat
the
way
i
was
suggested.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
understood
you
to
say
earlier
that
he
was
not
otherwise
admissible
if
he
had
told
that
he
would
not
have
been
otherwise
admissible
had
he
told
the
truth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
would
not
have
been
admitted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that's
the
first
hurdle
that
you
have
to
get
over,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
your
theory,
the
person
who
affirmatively
commits
the
fraud
of
lying
about
his
american
citizenship
is
in
a
better
position
than
the
fellow
who
doesn't
affirmatively
commit
any
fraud
but
just
to
walks
across
the
border
at
some
isolated
spot
on
the
canadian
woods
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
you
say
because
this
man
presented
himself
under
the
false
colors
of
an
american
citizen,
he
is
in
a
better
position
than
a
fellow
who
just
walked
across
the
border?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mrs.
lafontant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
second
circuit
seems
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
second
circuit
seems
to
have
distinguished
errico
on
the
ground
that
the
fraud
was
made
there
to
avoid
the
quota
restrictions
and
not
to
avoid
the
examination
at
the
border.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
the
fraud
at
least
in
respect
to
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
by
representing
himself
falsely
as
a
skilled
mechanic
etcetera,
he
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
avoided
the
quota
restrictions,
not
in
this
country
but
in
getting
the
visa
from
the
us
consul
wherever
he
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
he
possesses
skills
needed
in
this
market,
this
labor
market.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
the
key
factor
that
avoided
the
quota
restriction,
wasn't
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
that
it
was
the
quota
restriction,
misrepresentation
that
led
to
his
entry
and
he's
getting
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
getting
the
visa.
but
even
after
the
visa
as
you
pointed
out,
he
still
had
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
all
this
questions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
visa
was
merely
the
starting
point.
these
people
by
lying
at
the
point
of
entry
if
indeed
they
ever
in
fact
made
such
an
effort
avoided
all
of
these
inquiries
and
didn't
give
the
government
an
opportunity
to
check
them
until
many
years
later,
good
many
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we'll
resume
there
after
lunch
mrs.
lafontant.
mrs.
lafontant,
you
have
about
8
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
would
--
as
i
take
it
you're
point
is
that
you'd
have
to
do
a
much
closer
check
on
every
person
who
crosses
the
border
claiming
to
be
a
united
states
citizen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
would
be
over
a
hundred
million
people
if
in
fact
you
undertook
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
don't
all,
all
of
that
additional
132
million
don't
claim
to
be
american
citizens,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
so
your
check
would
be
--
presumably
you
already
checked,
the
government
already
checked
people
who
do
not
claim
to
be
united
states
citizens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
avid
check
would
be
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whatever
the
difference
is
between
that
and
the
232
million
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn't
something
like
that
tried
at
the
mexican
border
that
created
an
international
incident
within
the
past
year
or
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
mexican
government
at
least
has
--
i
don't
know
whether
they
judiciary
noticed
what
appears
in
newspaper
accounts
but
it
was
the
mexican
government
made
representations
to
the
state
department
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mrs.
lafontant,
thank
you
mr.
globman.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
hear
argument
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
