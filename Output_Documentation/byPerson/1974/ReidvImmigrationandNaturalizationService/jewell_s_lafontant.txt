ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
review
the
facts
very
briefly
again.
petitioners
who
are
citizens
of
british
honduras
and
married
to
each
other
entered
the
united
states
at
chula
vista,
california
which
is
on
the
mexican
border
by
falsely
stating
that
they
were
citizens
of
the
united
states.
the
husband
arrived
in
november
'68
and
his
wife
followed
january
of
'69
and
nine
months
thereafter
she
gave
birth
to
her
first
child
and
in
'71
gave
birth
to
her
second
child
and
of
course
their
children
are
american
citizens.
three
years
after
mr.
reid's
arrival,
he
was
--
they
were
served
with
petition
to
show
cause
or
an
order
to
show
cause
why
they
shouldn't
be
deported
because
they
entered
the
united
states
as
aliens
deportable
under
241
(a)
(2)
as
aliens
would
enter
the
united
states
without
inspection
as
aliens
claiming
being
citizens
of
the
united
states.
they
admitted
that
they
had
entered
fraudulently
by
claiming
united
states
citizenship.
they
admitted
that
they
had
not
secured
the
visa
upon
entry
and
they
also
admitted
that
they
did
not
present
themselves
to
the
immigration
officer
for
inspections
as
aliens.
however,
they
denied
the
legal
conclusion
that
they're
deportable,
contending
that
section
241
(f)
of
the
act
waives
deportation
in
the
case
of
aliens
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry
who
have
procured
entry
into
the
united
states
by
fraud
or
misrepresentation
and
have
close
family
ties
in
the
united
states.
the
special
inquiry
officer
upheld
the
charge
that
they
were
deportable
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
dismissed
their
appeal
claiming
that
aliens
who
circumvent
the
entire
visa
issuance
process
--
inspection
process
are
not
eligible
for
relief
under
241
(f).
the
petitioners
then
applied
for
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure
and
claimed
that
they
would
be
willing
to
leave
under
the
conditions
and
at
the
time
set
forth.
and
i
might
add
at
this
point,
mr.
justice
brennan,
this
is
the
point
where
the
special
inquiry
officer
for
this
purpose
found
them
of
good
moral
character
and
granted
their
petition
of
the
--
no
special
inquiry
officer
found
them
of
good
moral
character
at
the
time
of
entry,
it
was
only
in
reference
to
this
petition
for
voluntary
departure.
they
did
not
depart
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no,
there
is
no
finding
at
all
that
they
admitted
or
showed
themselves
to
an
immigration
officer
in
the
finding
special
inquiry
officer,
none
whatsoever.
of
course
they
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
they
false
claimed
united
states
citizenship
they
claimed
to
chula
vista,
on
the
border
of
mexico
when
they
entered.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
so
they
must
have
said
it
to
someone
but
there
is
no
finding,
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
you
can
tell
from
this
record
whether
they
swam
across
or
came
over
in
a
trunk
and
then
later
said
we
came
claiming
united
states
citizenship.
it
seems
to
be
taken
to
parameter
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no,
what
i'm
doing
is
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
think
that
is
something
we
must
accept
but
i'm
also
saying
that
it
ties
in
very
well
with
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
what
is
to
prevent
people
who
happen
to
come
in
by
some
other
means,
to
come
in
and
admit
and
say
i
entered
by
saying
i
was
united
states
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
--
citizenship
--
citizen
when
they
in
fact
did
not.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
but
i
think
we
should
have
to
accept
the
fact
that
they
entered
at
the
mexican
border
and
claimed
when
they
came
through,
we
are
americans,
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
think
it's
assumed
but
there
is
no
finding
of
that.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
correct,
that's
true.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
correct
your
honor.
although
the
privilege
of
voluntary
departure
was
granted,
the
petitioners
did
not
leave
but
instead
filed
a
petition
to
review
and
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
deportation
order.
and
since
this
decision
is
in
direct
conflict
with
two
decisions
of
the
ninth
circuit,
lee
fook
chuey
and
echeveria,
the
government
did
not
oppose
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
feels
that
this
issue
should
be
resolved
by
this
honorable
court.
the
petitioners
in
contending
that
they
are
not
deportable
under
section
241
(f)
rely
very
heavily
on
the
case
of
immigration
service
versus
errico.
errico
really
involves
two
cases
that
were
consolidated
because
of
the
one
issue
involved.
we
respectfully
submit
that
errico
is
limited
as
distinguishable
from
this
case
and
is
limited
to
its
own
facts
and
stands
for
the
proposition
that
quantitative
limitations,
that
is
quota
restrictions
cannot
preclude
an
alien
from
being
otherwise
admissible
within
the
meaning
of
241
(f).
in
one
of
the
cases,
mr.
errico
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
a
native
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
and
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
very
not,
not
happy
for
but
still
we
feel
that
even
though
in
spite
of
our
displeasure
with
errico
that
it
can
be
distinguished
from
this
present,
the
instant
case.
in
the
--
a
mr.
errico,
a
native
of
italy,
in
order
to
get
a
higher
quota
preference
deliberately
misrepresented
to
the
immigration
authorities
that
he
was
a
skilled
mechanic
experienced
in
the
repair
of
foreign
automobile.
he
was
granted
his
first
preference
quota,
he
was
lawfully
admitted
as
a
permanent
resident
and
he
and
his
wife
entered
the
united
states
in
1959,
and
thereafter,
a
child
was
born.
mr.
errico
had
gotten
an
immigrant
visa.
in
the
other
case,
a
ms.
scott,
a
native
of
jamaica
entered
into
a
--
in
order
to
get
a
none
quota
status,
entered
into
a
sham
bogus
proxy
marriage
with
an
american
citizen
whom
she
never
lived
and
with
whom
she
never
intended
to
live.
she
thereafter
had
an
illegitimate
child
in
the
united
states
after
having
been
admitted
here
in
1958.
in
both
scott
and
errico,
in
seeking
entry,
they
not
only
admitted
their
alienage
that
has
put
the
immigration
authorities
on
notice
that
here
we
are
two
aliens
coming
into
the
united
states,
they
had
to
present
valid
unexpired
immigrant
visas
and
prior
to
the
issuance
of
that
visa,
they
both
had
to
complete
background
questionnaires
which
went
into
the
--
cover
the
birth
records,
military
records
if
anything,
criminal
record
but
have
you.
not
only
did
they
have
to
do
that
but
they
submitted
photographs
of
themselves,
they
submitted
to
physical
and
mental
examinations,
they
were
registered
and
they
were
fingerprinted.
and
they
were
also
investigated
by
the
american
consul
in
italy
in
the
case
of
errico
and
in
jamaica
in
the
case
of
scott,
and
after
that
and
only
after
that,
a
passport
was
issued
and
thereafter
they
both
were
inspected
at
the
port
of
entry
into
the
united
states.
now,
when
it
is
said
by
petitioners
that
the
reid's,
the
petitioners
here
were
actually
inspected
at
the
border,
that's
impossible
because
they've
admitted
that
they
falsely
claim
that
they
were
citizens
and
although
we
don't
have
any
definition
of
inspection
in
the
immigration
act,
we
can
just
look
at
black's
law
dictionary
and
see
what
inspection
means
and
we
can
use
it.
inspection
is
a
critical
examination,
a
close
or
careful
scrutiny,
a
strict
or
prying
examination
or
an
investigation.
in
the
instant
case,
the
petitioners
concealed
their
alienage
completely
and
thus
avoided
any
investigation
by
the
authorities.
since
citizens
coming
into
the
united
states
do
not
require
to
go
through
inspection,
petitioners
were
able
to
evade
any
investigation.
and
mr.
justice
white
is
perfectly
correct
when
he
states
that
entry
concerns
aliens.
the
united
states'
citizen
really
cannot
make
an
entry
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
and
i
turn
to
section
1101
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
that
defines
entry
as
any
coming
of
an
alien
into
the
united
states,
any
coming
of
an
alien
into
the
united
states
from
a
foreign
port
of
a
place
or
outline
possession.
now,
the
purpose
of
the
two
step
inspection
process
that
is
the
visa
issuing
on
one
hand
and
the
inspection
at
the
border
is
for
the
main
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
an
alien
is
admissible
or
excludable.
and
it
also
serves
the
purpose
of
keeping
tab
on
or
keeping
tract
on
aliens
once
they
come
in
to
the
country.
and
it
is
crucial
to
a
lawful
admission
that
an
inspection
be
made.
section
1225
of
8
united
code
requires
that
all
aliens
shall
be
examined
by
immigration
officers
at
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general,
but
no
such
mandate
was
enacted
as
far
as
united
states
citizen
is
concerned.
now,
let's
look
at
the
language
of
section
241
(f)
itself,
which
provides
impertinent
part.
the
provisions
of
this
section
relating
to
the
deportation
of
aliens
on
the
ground
that
they
were
excludable
at
the
time
of
entry
as
aliens,
who
have
procured
entry
into
the
united
states
by
fraud
or
misrepresentation
shall
not
apply
to
an
alien
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry
who
is
a
spouse,
parent
or
child
of
a
united
states
citizen.
the
government
admits
that
section
241
(f)
is
not
intended
to
apply
to
petitioners
and
as
the
language
indicates
is
quite
limited
in
scope.
it
doesn't
wave
all
grounds
for
deportation
of
persons
who
are
closely
related
to
united
states
citizens,
but
only
waive
deportability
on
the
ground
that
they
were
aliens
excludable
at
the
time
of
entry,
for
having
procured
documents
or
entry
through
fraud.
furthermore,
it
applies
only
if
the
aliens
were
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry,
and
what
does
that
mean?
if
an
alien
avoids
the
entire
visa
issuance
inspection
process,
how
can
it
be
determined
that
he
is
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry?
were
we
dealing
with
simple
objective
facts
that
could
be
easily
ascertained
years
afterwards,
we
wouldn't
have
so
much
of
a
problem,
and
that
was
the
situation
in
errico.
but
i
submit
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
years
later
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
were
in
fact
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
they
entered
this
country
in
'68
and
'69.
the
important
phrase
is
i
submit
mr.
chief
justice
is
at
the
time
of
entry
applies
to
otherwise
admissible
rather
than
whether
or
not
the
petitioners
are
the
parents
of
children
or
married
to
an
american
citizen
at
the
time
of
entry.
it
refers
the
otherwise
--
admissible
refers
to
aliens
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry.
we
know
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
correct.
well,
that
i'm
saying
that
it
had
to
be
determined
at
that
time
because
with
the
passage
of
time
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
right.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
right.
and
then
to
try
to
reconstruct
it
six
years
later
as
in
this
case
would
be
an
impossible
task
because
we
know
that
evidence
dissipates,
witnesses
move
or
die
and
we
also
have
to
remember
that
this
information
would
have
to
be
gotten
from
the
alien's
homeland
not
from
this
country.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
they
didn't
--
they
did
not
find,
they
were
not
morally,
physically
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
--
or
mentally
otherwise
admissible.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
so
they
had
no
way
to
--
they
didn't
have
to
go
any
further.
they
said
that
the
quota
restriction
--
they
could
determine
that
and
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
but
they
also
in
the
errico
case,
they
also
tied
in
the
charge
with
the
fraud
and
when
they
said
otherwise
admissible
they
meant
otherwise
they
are
not
being
eligible
for
the
quota,
which
means
in
my
interpretation
of
it,
they
meant
otherwise
admissible
to
apply
to
the
qualitative
part
that
is
whether
or
not
they
were
mentally,
morally
and
physically
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry,
but
the
quota
they
could
--
they
took
on
its
face
that
--
and
i'm
not
carrying
a
brief
for
errico
but
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
--
is
limited,
hang
on
a
second
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
--
because
you
just
send
it
--
in
it,
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
--
that's
in
to
me
that's
the
big
distinguishing
--
one
of
the
big
distinguishing
factors.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
true
and
even
in
the
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
see.
because
even
when
we
were
trying
to
help
the
refugees
with
the
displaced
person's
act
and
the
refugee
relief
act
of
'53,
even
in
that
in
those
cases
where
we
were
trying
to
help,
it
was
definitely
stated
that
anyone
who've
misrepresented
his
nationality
or
made
any
misrepresentations
would
be
forever
barred
from
coming
into
this
country
and
then
later
because
of
the
rigidity
of
that,
there
was
an
alteration
made
but
even
then
it
said,
they
always
had
in
their
the
otherwise
admissible
alien.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
so
that
they've
never
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
true.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
there
was
a
fraud.
well,
the
main
fraud
was
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
--
that
he
--
they
lied
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
right.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
well,
when
i
referred
to
errico,
scott
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
--
it
was
consolidated
with
errico
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
--
so
its
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
correct.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
right
your
honor.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
first
co
defendants.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
right
your
honor.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
true.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
true,
but
the
charged
brought
against
them
was
--
let's
see
--
the
exact
charge
in
errico
was
a
fraudulently
entering
not
being
eligible
for
a
quota,
i
don't
know
how
it
was
worded.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
got
the
proving
reference,
right.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
well,
he
still
had
to
go
through
all
of
the
examinations
and
all.
he
lied
on
one
point
about
his
ability
but
he
did
not
evade
the
whole
system
and
he
was
found
qualified
for
admissibility
on
the
basis
of
being
physically,
morally,
and
mentally
fit.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
so
he
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
right,
right.
and
the
key
factor
in
the
scott
case
was
that
she
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
--
who
entered
the
marriage
and
was
the
wife
of
an
american
so
that's
how
she
avoided
the
quota
restriction,
but
i
interpret
errico
in
discussing
the
otherwise
admissible
still
did
not
reach
the
admissibility
requirements
that
i'm
discussing
now
of
quality.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
right.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
or
mental
or
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
--
prostitute
or
they
have
31
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
--
grounds
for
exclusion.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
now,
i'm
not
sure
if
i
answered
the
question
or
not.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
alright.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
right.
i'd
like
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
last
week
during
the
argument
of
a
case
before
this
honorable
court,
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
a
question
that
went
something
like
this.
would
it
be
a
disaster
if
this
court
ruled
opposite
to
your
argument?
if
the
same
question
were
asked
of
me
today,
my
answer
would
be
yes,
it
would
be
a
disaster.
certainly,
the
sky
would
fall
in
on
the
immigration
and
national
naturalization
service.
and
yes,
such
an
adverse
ruling
would
cause
a
paralysis
in
international
travel
especially
for
the
260
million
people
who
entered
the
united
states,
that's
the
number
of
people
who
went
to
the
united
states
in
1973.
it
would
be
--
represent
a
paralysis
for
all
of
the
united
states
citizens
and
hundred
million
or
more
who
entered
this
country
every
year.
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
immigration
and
naturalization
of
service
to
inspect
all
of
these
people
and
i
might
remind
the
court
that
232
million
of
these
people
who
entered
the
united
states
each
year
come
over
to
canadian
and
the
mexican
borders.
if
petitioner's
position
were
sustained,
aliens
would
be
free
to
claim
united
states
citizenship
falsely
and
have
an
unassailable
right
remain
here
forever.
indeed,
it
is
quite
possible
that
as
we've
alluded
to
before,
aliens
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
apply
for
241
(f)
relief.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
yes,
and
if
you
ruled
that
otherwise
admissible
--
admissible
doesn't
mean
anything,
it
would
be
--
open
the
floodgate
from
these
borders
for
the
people
to
come
in.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
close
relatives,
those
who
have
--
parents
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
right.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
definitely,
definitely.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
and
that's
an
impossibility
to
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
be
a
hundred
million
american
citizens
but
you'd
have
to
inspect
all
260
million
that
come
in.
232
million
that
come
over
the
border,
would
be
an
impossible
task
i
submit.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no,
that's
true.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
true.
so
it
would
be
another
hundred
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
definitely
a
hundred
million
who
are
bonafide
american
citizens,
we
don't
know
how
many
more
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
right.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
where
traffic
was
backed
up
for
miles
and
miles
and
miles
but
i
don't
remember
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
and
as
we
have
alluded
to
before,
these
aliens
with
the
required
child
or
spouse
could
--
well,
he
could
slip
over
say
in
a
car,
in
a
trunk
of
a
car
and
then
acquire
a
spouse
or
a
child
and
then
say
i
came
in
as
a
united
state
citizen
and
therefore
if
petitioner's
position
would
be
sustained
would
be
able
to
say
i'm
entitled
to
241
(f)
relief
because
i
lied
about
being
a
united
states
citizen.
this
would
produce
a
severe
enforcement
problem
as
is
obvious
because
there
are
hundreds
of
thousand
of
illegal
aliens
that
enter
the
united
states
yearly.
another
major
enforcement
difficulty
would
be
presented
for
those
who
enter
as
none
immigrants,
that
is
visitors
who
come
in
as
a
none
immigrant
saying
they
are
going
to
stay
just
for
temporary
period
of
time
and
then
a
year
later
say
well,
when
i
came,
i
really
intended
to
stay
forever
so
therefore
i'm
entitled
to
241
(f)
relief
also.
indeed,
aliens
who
entered
innocently
could
reasonably
press
for
an
equal
and
absolute
right
to
remain
on
a
theory
that
it
would
seem
unfair
to
treat
the
innocent
less
favorably
and
the
guilt
finally
would
make
a
mockery
of
congresses
numerical
limitations
which
we
have
to
presume
were
reached
after
careful
study
and
which
also
are
supposed
to
tell
us
how
many
people
this
country
can
safely
absorb.
so
we
will
be
doing
away
with
the
numerical
limitations
completely.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that
might
be
one
of
the
reasons
that
i
am
repeating
them
here
mr.
justice
stewart
and
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
in
closing,
we
might
--
we
want
to
ask
this
court
to
consider
errico
in
its
limited
fashion,
construe
it
narrowly
and
we
also
would
like
to
ask
the
court
that
to
rule
at
section
241
(f)
certainly
does
not
apply
to
aliens
posing
as
citizens
to
evade
the
complete
immigration
inspection
process
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
stated
in
the
descent
in
errico,
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
congress
enacted
this
legislation
to
allow
wholesale
evasion
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act
or
as
a
general
reward
for
fraud,
therefore
its
respectfully
submitted
that
the
judgment
of
the
court,
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you
very
much.
