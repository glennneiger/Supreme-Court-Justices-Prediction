mr.
benjamin
globman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
and
mrs.
reid
who
are
petitioners
in
this
specific
case
are
natives
of
british
honduras.
they
are
citizens
of
british
honduras.
both
of
them
entered
the
united
states
through
a
port
of
entry
at
chula
vista,
california.
they
each
in
individual
cases
presented
themselves
before
the
immigration
authorities
inspectors
and
announced
themselves
as
us
citizens.
they
were
admitted
and
entered
the
united
states
and
took
up
their
life
here
in
the
united
states.
subsequent
to
their
entry,
they
become
parents
of
two
american
born
children,
citizens
of
the
united
states.
mr.
benjamin
globman
litigation
arose
by
a
voluntary
faction
upon
the
part
of
the
reid's.
they
presented
themselves
to
the
immigration
service
at
hartford,
connecticut
voluntarily.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes,
yes
after
they
had
two
children,
they
presented
themselves
in
hartford
before
the
service
and
since
that
date
they
have
filed
their
annual
report.
now,
they
presented
themselves,
submitted
to
the
authority
of
the
service
and
were
placed
on
charges.
they
were
charged
with
having
entered
under
false
claim
of
citizenship
and
without
inspection.
they
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
at
least
that
goes
back
to
19
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
no,
about
two
years
after
their
entry.
mr.
reid
entered
in
1968
in
november
and
mrs.
reid
entered
in
'69,
either
january
or
february.
and
after
the
birth
of
the
first
child
and
while
mrs.
reid
was
pregnant,
they
reported
to
the
service.
the
hearing
before
the
sio,
the
special
inquiry
officer,
i
believe
was
held
in
1970
or
'71.
mr.
benjamin
globman
the
record
does
not
show.
in
any
event,
the
reid's
went
through
the
entire
hearing
process
before
the
immigration
service.
at
their
hearing,
deportation
hearing,
they
requested
termination
of
proceedings
based
upon
section
241
(f)
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
now,
this
section
has
been
adjudicated
by
this
court
in
the
errico
case.
now,
at
the
hearing,
they
were
denied
this
termination
of
proceedings
based
upon
the
attorney
general's
decisions
in
the
lee
case.
this
decision
of
the
special
inquiry
officer
who
entered
an
order
of
voluntary
departure
and
an
ultimate
order
of
deportation
was
appealed
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
once
again
on
the
basis
of
the
lee
case
denied
the
appeal
and
entered
the
same
order
as
the
special
inquiry
officer.
then
this
case
came
before
the
second
circuit
in
new
york
and
we
are
presently
here
on
the
matter
today.
now,
in
the
record,
it's
spelt
out
that
both
mr.
and
mrs.
reid
have
never
been
arrested,
have
never
been
a
member
of
any
subversive
organization
or
communist
organization
and
that
they
have
--
no,
i
might
say
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
that
ever
since
their
entry
into
the
united
states,
they
have
been
gainfully
employed
and
have
always
supported
each
other
and
their
children
have
never
been
upon
the
welfare
roles
of
any
agency
of
the
government
or
any
private
agency.
mr.
benjamin
globman
they
are
working
in
factories,
bench
hands,
machine
hands
and
they've
been
gainfully
employed
at
all
the
--
there
throughout
the
period.
mr.
benjamin
globman
they
are
in
danbury,
connecticut.
mr.
benjamin
globman
they've
been
there
since
very
shortly
after
their
entry.
mr.
benjamin
globman
they
entered
at
chula
vista,
california.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
globman
the
record
does
not
show
but
they
have
had
friends
in
the
area
and
after
they
entered
they've
decided
that
they
would
make
their
life
in
the
connecticut
area
where
they
have
friends.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
they
were
claimed
to
be
us
citizens
when
in
fact
they
were
not
us
citizens
and
on
the
basis
of
their
claim,
they
were
admitted.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes,
they
presented
themselves
to
the
us
immigration
authorities
at
chula
vista
and
announced
themselves
as
us
citizens
and
were
then
admitted.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that's
correct,
an
oral
representation.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct
but
this
has
been
found
in
the
record
by
the
special
inquiry
officer
that
they
were
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct.
mr.
benjamin
globman
then
they
probably
would
not
have
been
admitted.
they
would
have
been
sent
back
to
go
through
the
application
room
to
apply
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
to
the
us
consul
in
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
british
honduras.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct.
mr.
benjamin
globman
well,
yes.
let
me
say
for
the
record
that
they
probably
could
never
have
entered
the
united
states
but
we're
talking
about
coming
by
means
of
a
labor
certification,
which
means
that
they
had
obtained
a
certificate
from
a
labor
department
saying
that
they
were
needed
in
the
american
economy
because
there
were
no
other
labors
available
to
fill
the
specific
job
to
which
an
employer
had
sought
them.
they
would
never
have
entered
the
united
states
because
the
quota
was
backed
up
for
years.
so,
have
they
had
a
labor
certification,
they
could
not
have
obtained
a
visa
at
that
time.
now,
they're
here,
having
gone
through
the
entire
procedure
and
we're
confronted
this
morning
with
their
right
to
remain
here
under
the
statute.
this
court
has
faced
this
particular
section
of
the
statute,
section
241
(f)
in
the
errico
case
and
made
its
pronouncement
in
that
specific
area
that
the
government
here
this
morning
says
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
should
be
confined
strictly
only
to
quota
discussion
on
the
section.
their
claim
is
that
the
reid's
are
not
entitled
to
the
241
(f),
the
exception
or
exemption
from
deportation
because
they
failed
to
submit
that
to
inspection
they
say
that
this
is
not
an
inspection
and
they
say
also
that
they
failed
because
they
did
not
have
a
visa.
the
government
says
that
there
are
two
requirements,
that
first
of
all
that
there
be
a
visa
in
the
possession
of
the
intending
agent.
and
secondly,
that
in
presenting
this
visa
at
the
port
of
entry,
he
announced
himself
as
an
alien
and
then
be
put
through
the
examination
procedure
whatever
it
might
be
at
that
time.
now,
the
examination
at
the
port
of
entry
can
be
either
rigid
or
be
perfunctory.
if
a
person
comes
in
with
a
visa
regardless
of
whether
this
visa
was
obtained
legal
and
without
fraud
and
submits
himself
at
the
port
of
entry
to
an
immigrant
--
immigration
officer,
the
immigration
officer
can
do
one
of
two
things.
he
can
merely
take
the
man's
passport,
open
it
up
to
the
visa's
page,
see
that
it
has
stamp
and
feeling
assured
in
his
own
mind
that
this
is
a
genuine
visa
that
is
not
a
forgery
or
phony,
admit
him
and
this
would
be
the
entire
inspection
procedure
at
the
port
of
entry
or
he
can
go
to
the
entire
again
--
and
once
again
take
out
the
papers,
go
through
it
question
by
question,
where
were
you
born,
produce
the
birth
certificate
to
show
it
and
the
status
of
your
health,
if
he
wanted
to
at
that
time
he
could
require
him
to
have
a
new
physical
examination.
he
could
require
that
any
documents
which
he
might
have
in
his
possession
showing
that
he
would
not
become
a
public
charged
be
updated
and
can
do
any
one
of
this
things
that
the
counsel
has
already
done
prior
to
his
arriving
at
the
port
of
entry.
now,
for
the
most
part
however,
examinations
at
the
port
of
entry
are
strictly
perfunctory.the
immigration
officer
opens
the
passport,
sees
the
visa
stamped
in
the
passport
then
if
he
feels,
assured
that
this
is
a
genuine
passport,
this
is
about
the
sum
of
it,
takes
his
papers
and
that's
the
answer.now,
though
we
claim
here
that
any
person
coming
into
the
united
states
under
a
claim
of
us
citizenship
and
meeting
the
other
requirements
being
otherwise
admissible
and
having
in
this
specific
case
us
children
is
-
mr.
benjamin
globman
in
the
record,
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
only
under
labor
certification
that
they
would
have
had
to
wait
for
a
visa
until
sometime
late
in
the
future
but
at
the
factual
situation,
at
the
time
of
their
entry,
the
quota
for
six
preference,
they
had
to
come
in
under
the
sub
quota
of
great
britain
and
there
are
only
200
visas
issued
annually
under
this
sub
quota
and
they
would
be
in
the
six
preference
have
they
had
a
labor
certification.
this
would
be
their
only
disqualification
if
you
want
to
call
it
that.
that
they
did
not
have
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
--
a
labor
certification.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes,
the
qualitatively
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes.
first
of
all,
there
was
no
moral
question.
the
sio,
the
special
inquiry
officer
found
that
they
had
the
moral
qualifications.
they
have
the
physical
qualifications.
they
were
not
members
of
any
subversive
organization.
no
criminal
record.
and
were
therefore
under
212
(a)
admissible.
mr.
benjamin
globman
quota.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes,
errico
says
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
--
on
the
quantitative,
on
the
quantitative
admissibility,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct.
mr.
benjamin
globman
they
are
parallel,
yes.
mr.
benjamin
globman
they're
the
same,
they're
the
same
because
of
the
actual
fact
of
the
quota
at
that
time.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
quota
today
is
still
backed
up
in
british
honduras.
mr.
benjamin
globman
based
on
the
quota.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes,
based
on
a
quota.
mr.
benjamin
globman
no,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
so
at
all.
i
think
the
statute
--
reenactment
of
the
statute
was
basically
for
the
purpose
of
correcting
situations
that
had
already
taken
place.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
protect
certain
small
groups
of
individuals
who
found
their
way
into
the
united
states
and
that
the
statute
comes
into
a
fact
long
after
the
breech
has
been
committed.
the
violation
has
been
committed.
it's
a
remedial
statute
and
it
was
introduced
to
soften
the
harsh
provisions
of
the
statute.
this
is
not
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
only
your
honor
if
the
entry
is,
actual
entry
is
gained
by
fraud.
the
inspector
service
procure
entry
by
fraud.
it
gives
many
and
they're
all
in
the
disjunctive,
it's
not
a
conjunctive
qualification.
it's
disjunctive
mean
giving
the
individuals
in
each
of
these
categories
of
the
protection
of
the
law.
mr.
benjamin
globman
then
you
have
a
problem
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
no.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that's
correct.
this
is
a
procure
entry
by
fraud
or
misrepresentation.
and
there
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
visa.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct
and
we're
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct.
mr.
benjamin
globman
pardon?
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct.
mr.
benjamin
globman
translation
of
the
statute.
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct.
the
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
let
me
say,
that
the
court
in
the
second
circuit
admitted
that
under
the
literal
translation,
literal
interpretation
of
this
statute
that
the
reid's
are
entitled
to
this
relief.
now,
in
the
history
of
the
statute,
the
errico
case
i
think
is
complete
on
the
history.
there
is
very
little
involved.
it
traces
the
history
from
the
refugee
acts,
the
displaced
persons
acts.
and,
it
takes
up
to
1952
with
the
mccarran
act
which
was
a
harsh
law
and
then
it
takes
it
back
to
the
present
act,
this
specific
section
in
'61.
now,
perhaps
if
i
could
refer
to
the
material.
alright,
the
court
in
the
errico
decision
said,
the
misrepresentation
section
was
not
the
only
provision
of
the
1952
legislation
that
was
widely
thought
to
be
unnecessarily
harsh
and
restrictive,
and
in
1957,
congress
passed
legislation
alleviating
in
mental
respect
the
restrictive
provisions
of
the
earlier
legislation.
the
purpose
of
the
1957
act
is
perfectly
clear
from
us
terms
as
well
as
from
the
relevant
house
and
senate
committee
reports.
the
most
important
of
the
act
provide
for
a
special
none
quota
status
for
the
adopted
children
or
illegitimate
children
of
immigrant
parents
and
for
orphans
who
have
been
or
are
to
be
adopted
by
united
states
citizens.
then
it
goes
on
to
says,
the
intent
of
the
act
is
plain
that
you
grant
exceptions
to
the
rigorous
provisions
of
the
1952
act
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
family
units
together.
congress
felt
that
in
many
circumstances,
it
was
more
important
to
unite
families
and
preserve
family
ties
than
it
was
to
enforce
strictly
the
quota
limitations
or
even
the
many
restrictive
sections
that
are
designed
to
keep
undesirable
or
harmful
aliens
out
of
the
country.
now,
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
then
i
think
you're
involved
in
the
credibility
of
the
individuals.
mr.
benjamin
globman
i
think
you
take
the
whole
person
in
this
specific
case.
when
he
--
when
the
person
becomes
involved
with
the
immigration
authorities,
he
goes
through
an
exhaustive
investigative
process
by
the
investigation
department
before
charges
are
brought.
there's
an
investigation
of
the
applicant
or
in
this
case
the
alien
and
upon
the
basis
of
the
investigation
made
by
the
investigators
in
the
immigration
service,
charges
are
brought.
now,
then
these
charges
are
tried
before
what
is
present
and
known
as
an
immigration
judge
form
of
the
--
formerly
the
special
immigration,
special
inquiry
officer
and
at
this
hearing,
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
him
to
prove
himself.
in
other
words,
the
credibility
of
the
individual
is
considered
by
the
immigration
judge.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes.
mr.
benjamin
globman
well,
my
answer
is
that
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question,
hypothetic
question
is
that
there's
the
opportunity
for
a
judgment
of
credibility.
the
justice
asked
now
three
or
four
years
after
a
man
gets
into
the
country
no
matter
how
he
gets
in,
he
then
says
before
the
department
of
a
service
that
he
presented
himself
as
a
us
citizen
at
an
entry
point.
my
answer
is
that
could
take
the
total
person,
it's
a
question
of
credibility.
he
proves
himself
out.
mr.
benjamin
globman
he
proved
that
he
has
committed
fraud
but
he
also
proved
what
the
fraud
is.
mr.
benjamin
globman
no
question
but
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
i
say
that
is
how
the
errico
case
read
it.
that
is
how
the
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes.
i
suppose
it
can
be
read
that
way.
i
mean,
even
the
clearest
language
means
different
things
to
different
readers.
the
--
to
me
it
doesn't
read
that
way.
mr.
benjamin
globman
i
think
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
i
think
if
that
is
what
the
section
is
saying,
i
think
it
would
say
it
in
this
manner.
who
is
at
the
time
of
entry
a
spouse,
parent
or
child?
that
to
me,
that
would
be
lucid
in
carrying
out
your
question.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes.
mr.
benjamin
globman
well,
now,
at
the
time
of
inquiries,
i
--
there
are
readers
who
are
excludable
at
the
time
of
entry,
yes.
i
take
the
other
attack
that
it
would
be
lucid
if
it's
stated
that
to
follow
out
your
thought,
to
carry
out
your
thought
or
your
construction
of
a
statute,
it
should
read
who
at
the
time
of
entry
is
or
who
is
at
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
well,
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes.
mr.
benjamin
globman
but
i
feel
that
if
this
is
what
the
meaning
of
this
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
right.
mr.
benjamin
globman
i
say
what
the
statute
is
saying,
who
shall
not
apply
to
an
alien
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry
and
then
says
who
presently
is,
the
spouse,
parent
or
child
of
a
united
states
citizen.
i
think
i
am
consistent
in
my
argument
that
this
present
tense
carries
out
at
the
time
of
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
time
of
deportation,
yes
and
bringing
it
up
to
the
time
when
the
government
is
calling
to
account
the
alien.
mr.
benjamin
globman
had
he
told
the
truth
-
mr.
benjamin
globman
he
would
not
have
been
admitted,
no.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes.
however,
we're
saying
that
we're
in
the
same
situation
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
a
smuggler
doesn't
overtly,
orally
present
himself
for
inspection
and
commit
a
misrepresentation.
mr.
benjamin
globman
he
does.
mr.
benjamin
globman
under
the
statute,
under
the
immigration
act
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
of
the
language
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
the
act
does
not
say
that
he
presents
himself
as
an
alien.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes.
mr.
benjamin
globman
no,
the
coming
--
you
see,
every
immigration
inspector
have
the
right
to
examine
any
individual
whether
he
claims
to
be
a
citizen
or
whether
he
claims
to
be
an
alien
and
even
citizens
can
be
held
and
made
to
prove
their
citizenship.
they
can
be
held,
detained
and
held
until
such
time
as
they
sustained
the
burden
of
proving
their
us
citizenship.
mr.
benjamin
globman
i
think
exquisitely
the
statute
does
not
read
that
question.
i
think
of
an
exquisite
interpretation
of
the
statute
--
mr.
benjamin
globman
that
is
correct
because
he
has
given
the
service
and
opportunity
of
checking
his
statements.
the
fellow
who
crosses
that
a
border
where
there
is
no
border
crossing
point
or
who
comes
in
the
trunk
of
an
automobile
or
as
a
stow
away
by
the
point
of
embarkation,
never
presents
himself
before
a
us
immigration
inspector.
mr.
benjamin
globman
he
is.
mr.
benjamin
globman
a
forged
american
passport?
mr.
benjamin
globman
i
say
yes.
mr.
benjamin
globman
yes.
mr.
benjamin
globman
exactly
because
he's
presented
himself
for
inspection.
mr.
benjamin
globman
he
would
definitely
be
convicted,
yes.
thank
you.
