justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
show
either
why
they
happened
to
come
in
at
chula
vista
or
how
they
ended
up
in
connecticut?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
globman,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
about
the
statute
which
i
guess
is
set
forth
at
page
two
of
the
government's
brief
and
its
probably
set
forth
in
your
brief
too.
when
you
get
down
to
the
language,
an
alien
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry
who
is
the
spouse,
parent
or
a
child
of
the
united
states
citizen
of
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
resident.
isn't
at
least
a
permissible
construction
of
that
statute
that
at
the
time
of
entry
you
have
to
have
been
the
parent
or
the
spouse?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
the
man
gets
in
and
then
marry?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
gets
in
then
has
children?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course,
if
your
construction
that
you're
urging,
this
case
is
right,
isn't
it
pretty
much
just
an
open
door
policy,
if
you
can
just
get
through
in
some
way
and
have
a
child,
you're
okay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
assuming
those
are
the
only
one
who
should
need
relief.
the
once
who
get
in
there
lawfully
don't
need
to
worry
about
deportation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
submit
by
fraud
to
do
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
globman,
if
we
uphold
your
position
here,
what's
to
prevent
any
number
of
people
from
coming
in
surreptitiously
and
then
testifying
two
or
three
years
later
yes
i
did
go
to
the
customs
agent
at
chula
vista
and
i
said
i
was
an
american
citizen
and
presumably,
if
its
an
informal
contact,
no
one
will
be
able
to
say
no
to
that
and
just
get
in
under
this
provision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
someone
who
would
commit
fraud
in
the
first
place
i
presume
may
have
some
doubts
as
to
his
credibility
in
general?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
proves
that
he
committed
fraud.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it
--
why
under
the
statute
isn't
a
person
who
just
smuggled
in
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
doesn't
present
himself
for
inspection
if
he
says
i'm
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
either?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
doesn't.
he
does
--
as
an
alien
he
doesn't
permit
--
he
doesn't
submit
himself
to
inspection
as
an
alien.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
prior
law
prior
to
this
--
prior
to
this,
when
people
misrepresented
their
nationality,
they
had
to
show
that
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
some
kind
of
persecution
in
some
country
which
and
i
suggest
--
i
suggest
that
the
contrary
argument
is
that
--is
that
the
statute
intends
the
alien
to
have
submitted
himself
as
an
alien.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
because
submitting
him
--
saying
that
he's
a
citizen
is
just
like,
is
not
submitting
himself
as
an
alien
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
know,
it
says
entry?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
entry
is
defined
as
an
entry
by
an
alien?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
looking
over
the
decision
of
the
special
inquiry
officer
and
i
just
looked
over
the
first
time
on
that
bench,
i
must
say
i
don't
find
any
finding
by
him
that
these
people
presented
themselves
to
an
immigration
officer
in
chula
vista?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
special
inquiry
officer
didn't
so
find.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
no.
73-1541,
reid
versus
the
ins.
petitioners
are
aliens,
husband
and
wife,
who
entered
the
united
states
from
british
honduras
falsely
representing
themselves
to
be
citizens
and
thereby
avoiding
inspection
at
the
port
of
entry
at
which
they
entered
which
was
chula
vista,
california.
they
later
had
two
children
born
in
this
country.
the
ins
instituted
deportation
proceedings
against
them
under
section
241
(a)
(2)
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
act
which
makes
entering
into
the
united
states
without
inspection
a
grounds
for
deportation.
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
held
petitioners
deportable
under
these
provision
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
this
decision.
petitioners
argued
below
and
here
that
they
were
safe
from
deportation
by
section
241
(f)
of
the
act
providing
for
a
waiver
of
deportability
by
raising
a
fraud
or
misrepresentation
for
certain
aliens
which
specified
familial
relationships
to
united
states
citizens.
in
the
words
of
my
brother
stewart
making
a
similar
oral
announcement
several
weeks
ago,
the
court's
opinion
in
itself
does
lend
itself
to
any
detailed
summary.
for
reasons
set
forth
and
some
detail
in
the
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
correct
in
holding
that
these
aliens
were
deportable
and
that
this
case
is
not
controlled
by
our
prior
decision
in
immigration
and
nationalization
service
versus
errico.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
is
accordingly
affirmed.
mr.
justice
brennan
who
mr.
justice
marshall
joins
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
case.
mr.
justice
douglas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
