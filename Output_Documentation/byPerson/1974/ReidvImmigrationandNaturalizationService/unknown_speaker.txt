unknown
speaker
well,
i
known
but
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
requirement
of
the
section
is
they
must
not
alone
have
children
but
also
be
otherwise
admissible?
unknown
speaker
now,
tell
me
again
how
the
--
other
--
they
were
otherwise
admissible
at
the
time
of
entry.
unknown
speaker
notwithstanding
the
backed
up
--
unknown
speaker
quota.
unknown
speaker
then
i
gather
in
errico
it
was
obtaining
a
visa
--
unknown
speaker
--
by
fraud
--
unknown
speaker
by
fraud
not
misrepresentation.
unknown
speaker
while
then
here
you
didn't
obtain
a
visa,
your
clients
evaded
--
unknown
speaker
you
obtained
your
entry
by
fraud
as
i
understand
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
your
argument
i
gather
is
that
there
can't
be
any
difference
in
light
of
the
literal
--
unknown
speaker
--
warning
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
legislative
history?
how
far
is
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
deportation.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that,
i'm
just
suggesting
perhaps
the
statute
should
be
construed
to
me
that
--
that
if
benefits
are
extended
to
those
who
submit,
who
enters
as
aliens.
and
in
the
process
commit
fraud,
fraudulent
visa
or
some
other
kind
of
false
documentation.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
meant
by
each
under
the
united
states
by
forcedly
claiming
to
be
us
citizen?
where
did
the
--
where
would
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
but
unto
whom,
but
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
is
it
--
unknown
speaker
is
it
distinguishable
because
its
limited
to
its
own
facts
or
i
think
you
put
it
in
the
conjunctive.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
your
not
very
happy
with
the
errico
decision?
