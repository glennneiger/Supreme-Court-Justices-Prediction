justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
that
mr.
reid
had
had
a
forged
american
passport,
would
that
make
the
case
different?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
let's
assume
he
bought
it
himself
or
forged
it
himself
and
he
simply
presented
it
at
the
port
of
entry.
in
this
case
as
i
understand
he
had
no
papers,
nobody
asked
him
any
questions,
he
said
i'm
a
us
citizen.
well,
he
hands
in
a
passport
which
says
on
its
face
that
he
is
a
us
citizen
but
it's
a
fraudulent
document.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you'd
say
the
statute
does
apply.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
exactly
like
mr.
reid?
