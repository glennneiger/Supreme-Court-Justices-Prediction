justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
let
me
ask
you
about
that
statute?
was
this
argued
to
the
lower
courts
in
your
state
in
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
that
statute
win
your
case
for
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
roe,
if
you
prevail
here,
do
you
still
win
or
lose
than
what
is
the
date
when
under
this
statute
support
ceases?
is
it
18
for
both
boys
and
girls?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
is
it
21
for
both
sons
and
daughters?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
is
it
something
that
we
can
determine
here?
isnt
that
something
--
suppose
we
strike
it
down
as
violative
of
equal
protection,
isnt
that
something
for
the
utah
court
to
consider?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
the
statute
wipes
that
out
anyway,
doesnt
it?
when
a
girl
marries
she
no
longer
is
subject
to
the
provisions
for
support
as
i
read
it,
right?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
she
is
asking
for
monetary
relief,
is
she
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
utah.
the
appellant
and
the
appellee
were
married
in
1951
and
divorced
in
utah
in
1960.
they
have
a
daughter
and
a
son.
the
utah
divorce
decree
incorporated
a
stipulation
between
the
parties
that
the
husband
would
make
monthly
payments
to
the
wife
for
the
support
of
each
of
the
children.
when
the
daughter
reached
18,
the
husband
discontinued
payments
for
her
support.
the
utah
divorce
court
denied
wife's
motion
for
support
for
her
daughter
for
the
period
after
she
attained
age
18
and
did
so
pursuant
to
a
utah
statute
providing
that
the
period
of
minority
for
males
extends
to
age
21
and
for
females
only
to
age
18.
on
appeal,
the
utah
supreme
court
affirmed
and
rejected
the
wife's
claim
that
the
statute
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
utah
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
hold
that
in
the
context
of
child
support,
the
age
classification
made
by
the
statute
denies
equal
protection.
we
find
nothing
rational
in
the
statutory
distinction
between
males
and
females
which
when
related
to
the
divorce
decree
results
in
the
husband's
liability
for
support
for
the
daughter
only
to
age
18
but
for
the
son
to
age
21.
i'm
authorized
to
state
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
