justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes
but
it
stops,
does
it
not
because
in
effect
this
statute
1521,
your
supreme
court
has
read
into
the
divorce
decree,
hasnt
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
if
thats
so
what
we
in
fact
have
is
an
ordinary
support
decree
as
if
it
had
been
negotiated
between
the
parties
as
the
court
has
construed
it,
isnt
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
it
did
or
didn't,
whatever
it
may
have
been,
isnt
that
the
fact?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didnt
suggest
that
but
as
if
they
had
stipulated,
how
otherwise
that
this
court
read
this
statute
into
the
divorce
decree?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
roe,
i
confess
this
opinion
of
your
supreme
court
is
not
a
model
of
clarity,
but
my
questions
earlier
are
prompted
by
what
appears
at
10
(a)
and
11
(a)
of
the
opinion.
the
general
rule
is
that
the
decree
fixes
the
obligations
of
the
parties
and
over
at
11
(a)
the
support
money
accrued
in
accordance
with
its
terms.
now,
how
do
we
read
that,
if
not
that
the
supreme
court,
your
supreme
court,
read
this
decree
as
incorporating
the
provisions
of
that
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
the
difficulty
â€“
isnt
there
a
difficulty
with
that
that
the
parties
did
agree
to
that.
i
think
you
told
us
earlier
that
the
concept
--
that
the
decree
was
agreed
upon
by
the
parties,
the
divorce
decree
that
is,
when
entered,
wasnt
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
problem
here
is
not
whether
the
money
shall
be
paid
to
the
daughter,
rather
it
is
whether
the
money
shall
be
paid
to
the
mother?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
she
is
the
one
that
was
--
is
the
one
who
wanted
the
decree
according
to
the
terms
of
the
decree,
is
to
the
one
to
whom
the
husband
pays
the
money?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
now
i'm
only
suggesting
that
it
seems
to
me
that
your
supreme
court
is
in
effect
reading
the
decree
as
limiting
the
husbands
obligation
for
support
for
the
payments
to
the
mother
on
behalf
of
the
daughter
to
the
years
before
shes
18
and
for
the
son
until
hes
21?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
old
is
this
statute,
mr.
roe?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
15
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
involved
here
in
dollars
and
cents
is
three
years,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
young
lady
became
21
on
february
12,
1974?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
actually
that's
$3,600.00,
is
that
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
even
if
there
were
reversal
there,
it
may
not
--
then
it
have
to
go
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
utah
which
and
as
been
suggested
it
might
say
no
both
cuts
off
at
18?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
might
still
win?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
but
does
that
mean
that
during
the
time
she
was
18
and
21,
the
mother
anyway
under
this
new
statute
had
an
obligation
to
supply
support
whether
or
not
the
father
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
mother
did
in
fact
supply
the
support
as
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
if
she
has
any
basis
to
attempt
to
secure
contribution
from
her
husband,
how
does
she
go
about
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
what
--
what
would
he
do?
does
he
pay
--
perhaps
reimburse
her
for
the
full
amount?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
heard
this
morning
they
rejected
it
last
night.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
the
radio
said.[laughter]
