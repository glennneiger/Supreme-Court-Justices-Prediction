justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
parties
here
couldve
provided
for
termination
at
any
age,
i
take
it,
by
agreement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
it
did
leave
open,
i
take
it,
the
supreme
court
of
utah,
the
possibility
that
if
the
decree
had
provided
otherwise
that
the
statute
would
have
played
no
harm?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
the
supreme
court
of
utah
were
to
come
out
to
say
if
this
court
were
to
invalidate
the
distinction,
the
supreme
court
of
utah
would
say,
“alright,
from
now
on
its
18
for
everybody.”
your
client
would
take
nothing,
you
would
not
benefit
at
all
from
this
lawsuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
this
would
be
quite
independent
of
a
divorced
decree
or
any
divorce
proceeding?
