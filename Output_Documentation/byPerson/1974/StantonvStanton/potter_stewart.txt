what
was
--
this
decree
was
that
something
that
was
negotiated
and
agreed
upon
between
the
parties?
justice
potter
stewart
if
that
was
negotiated
against
the
background
of
this
statute
as
far
as
standing
statute
of
utah,
wasnt
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
appellants
brief,
defendant
is
ordered
to
pay
the
plaintiff,
is
that
it?

certainly,
as
one
reads
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
utah,
its
rational
doesnt
seem
to
be
at
all
as
indicated
in
questions
from
the
bench.
right
at
the
beginning,
is
the
court
states
that
the
question
before
it
is
the
constitutionality
of
section
1521,
utah
code
annotated
1953,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
goes
on
to
consider
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
suggest
it
all
that
the
parties
--
that
its
construing
the
decree
as
such
and
that
since
it
was
negotiated
decree
its
equivalent
to
having
explicitly
said
support
the
son
until
hes
21
and
the
daughter
until
shes
18.
thats
no
part
of
its
rational.
justice

opinion
in
this
case?

way
back
to
territorial
days?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isnt
that
how
this
whole
lawsuit
arose?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
does
involve
three
years
worth
of
support
payments?
