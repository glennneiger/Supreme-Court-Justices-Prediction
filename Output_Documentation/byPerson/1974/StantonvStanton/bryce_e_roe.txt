mr.
bryce
e.
roe
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
utah
has
a
statute
on
its
books
and
has
had
since
1852
that
females
attain
their
majority
at
the
age
of
18
years
and
that
males
attain
their
at
the
age
of
21.
in
the
case
today
were
challenging
that
statute
under
the
equal
protection
clause
of
amendment
fourteenth.
the
facts
out
of
which
the
case
arose
are
quite
simple.
this
was
a
divorce
proceeding
in
which
the
wife
had
been
awarded
custody
of
two
children
and
the
husband
had
been
ordered
to
pay
support
money
for
the
two
children.
some
years
after
the
entry
of
the
divorce
decree,
the
wife
filed
a
proceeding
in
the
district
court
to
have
some
past
due
support
money
reduced
to
judgment.
she
contended
that
the
husband
was
obligated
to
continue
to
pay
support
money
for
the
children
even
though
the
wife
or
the
daughter
had
achieved
the
age
of
18
years.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
its
not
uncommon,
your
honor.
it
happens
both
ways
actually.
i
think
more
careful
counsel
nowadays
do
put
some
provision
in
the
decree,
but
there
have
been
frequent
cases
in
which
the
decree
has
provided
only
that
they
will
pay
support
for
the
children.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
by
stipulation,
i
would
see
no
reason
why
they
could
not
have
done
that.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
there
was
a
stipulation
for
the
decree
and
for
the
awarding
of
the
divorce
to
the
wife
and
for
the
granting
of
custody
to
her
and
to
the
payment
of
support
for
the
children.
the
decree
did
not
say
to
what
age
the
support
would
continue.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes
sir,
there
were
two
statutes
in
effect
at
that
time.
however,
there
was
a
statute
enacted
three
years
before
this
divorce
in
1957
and
which
was
the
uniform
civil
liability
for
support
act.
in
that
statute,
a
child
was
defined
as
being
child
of
either
age
under
the
age
of
20
or
either
sex
under
the
age
of
21.
so,
there
were
some
--
this
was
a
statute
that
had
not
been
enforced
very
long
at
the
time
of
that
decree.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
the
application
of
the
support
statute?
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes
your
honor
it
was.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
it
would
have
won
the
case
for
us,
if
the
supreme
court
had
seemed
fit
to
interpret
it
as
establishing
the
age
to
which
support
would
continue
in
a
divorce
proceeding.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
utah
did
not
discuss
the
statute
even
though
it
was
briefed
to
the
court.
but
--
so
we
have
a
situation
in
which
we
dont
have
a
support
denied
to
daughters
over
the
age
of
18
while
its
given
to
sons
between
18
and
21
because
the
support
statute
provides
that
the
support
will
continue
for
both
of
them
until
they're
21
except
that
under
the
support
statute,
the
obligee
is
the
son
or
daughter.
so
that
any
action
to
enforce
the
support
outside
of
the
divorce
decree
would
have
to
be
brought
by
the
son
or
daughter
--
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
that
is
correct.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
well,
it
stops
in
a
divorce
proceeding.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
thats
correct.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
well,
but
this
construction
didnt
occur
until
sometime
after
the
court
--
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
no,
i
dont
think
the
court
based
this
on
any
concept
that
the
parties
had
stipulated
with
respect
to
the
ages
at
which
--
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
well,
it
said
that
support
money
ends
at
the
age
of
majority,
daughters
attain
their
majority
when
they're
18,
so,
the
support
money
ends.
that
was
the
reasoning
of
the
utah
supreme
court.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
i
suppose
it
was
left
open.
the
question
was
not
raised
or
discussed
in
that
proceeding.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
decided
on
the
basis
on
the
statute
and
its
application
to
a
divorce
proceeding.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
well,
i
would
think
that
looking
--
oh!
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
i
would
think
looking
at
the
general
legislative
policy
it
would
have
to
be
21
for
both.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
well,
there
is.
this
court,
i
think
can
decide
the
effect
of
the
invalidity
of
the
statute.
now,
at
common
law
of
course,
the
age
of
majority
for
both
men
and
women
was
21
years.
one
of
the
possibilities
is
to
apply
the
common
law
without
regard
to
the
statute.
in
addition,
we
have
a
general
declaration
of
legislative
policy
that
support
will
continue
for
children
until
they're
21
years.
so,
we're
--
until
they're
21
years
old,
both
of
them
and
then
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
excluded
group
should
be
given
the
benefit
of
the
statute.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
thats
--
if
the
supreme
court
of
utah
felt
it
could
do
that,
thats
correct.
we
would
have
to
lose
on
that
question.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
well,
yes
i
think.
you're
talking
about
two
different
things
here.
i
recognize
that
there
has
been
a
tendency
to
reduce
the
age
to
18
in
a
number
of
instances.
in
the
utah
statutory
scheme
that
is
correct
too
with
respect
to
a
lot
of
the
activities
and
lot
of
the
disabilities
that
are
placed
upon
children,
but
in
this
application
particularly,
21
is
the
age
to
which
support
should
be
given
because
we
have
a
subsequent
statute
that
establishes
that.
so
what
we
--
what
has
really
happened
with
the
utah
supreme
court
in
rulings
that
did
is
to
place
a
different
kind
of
burden
on
18
to
21-year-old
daughters
and
on
18
to
21-year-old
sons
even
though
they're
both
entitled
to
support
under
the
uniform
civil
liability
for
support
statute.
one
of
them
can
obtain
this
support
by
the
parent
going
into
the
divorce
proceeding
over
which
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
customarily
and
obtaining
a
support
order
or
use
the
contempt
features
and
so
on.
whereas
a
daughter
achieving
the
age
of
18
would
be
compelled
to
bring
a
suit
against
her
father
if
she
was
entitled
to
support
and
he
was
the
one
who
had
the
money
with
which
to
support
her.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
she
--
i
have
never
found
a
case
in
which
that
has
been
done.
the
supreme
court
of
utah
has
talked
in
some
instances
that
if
the
right
at
least
for
current
support
belongs
to
the
child.
though
they
talk
in
terms
of
past
due
support
which
has
been
supplied
by
a
parent
as
being
a
right
that
is
in
the
parent.
in
other
words,
there
are
limitations
upon
the
extent
at
which
the
parties
can
stipulate
a
way
the
right
of
the
child
are
current
and
future
support
but
with
respect
to
past
support
if
the
money
has
been
or
the
support
has
been
provided
then
the
parent
has
the
right
and
the
child
doesnt.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
there's
been
no
issue
about
that.
she
was
living
with
her
mother.
she
had
custody
of
her
and
was
taking
care
of
her.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
well,
it
certainly
did
do
that.
i
dont
think
it
read
the
stipulation
of
the
parties
as
doing
that
and
thats
just
what
were
complaining
about
that
the
decree
here
incorporates
the
provisions
of
a
statute
which
operates
unfairly
and
invidiously
with
respect
to
one
class.
now,
if
it
were
stipulated
judgment
--
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
well,
it
was
a
simple
stipulation
before
decree
and
i
think
and
its
fairly
customarily
they
say,
“we
stipulate
that
the
divorce
may
be
entered
if
the
mother
proves
grounds
and
that
she
may
have
custody
and
will
pay
so
much
support
money.
”
now,
--
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
and
that
is
correct.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
there
--
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
well,
thats
what
the
court
is
doing.
i
dont
--
i
didnt
read
the
opinion
as
if
the
court
were
saying
looking
back
at
1960
and
in
view
of
the
statutes
then
what
the
parties
did
and
what
the
court
did
by
way
of
--
means
of
interpretation
i
should
say,
they
meant
to
fix
this
at
18
instead
of
21.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
i
think
we
would
still
have
the
same
question.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
no,
i
think
--
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
if
the
parties
agreed
to
pay
support
to
one
of
them
until
that
she
was
18
and
the
other
until
21
and
the
court
approved
it.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
well,
i
agree.
i'll
take
back
what
i
said
first.
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
case.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
but
this
decision
was
based
upon
an
interpretation
of
the
state
law
and
its
application
and
not
upon
the
use
of
the
state
law
to
try
and
interpret
what
the
parties
were
stipulating
to.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
but
the
stipulation
did
not
purport
to
incorporate
anything,
did
not
in
fact
refer
to
age
of
majority,
referred
only
to
children.
in
the
context
in
which
this
stipulation
was
entered
into
having
come
three
years
after
a
new
statute,
putting
the
obligation
on
parents
to
support
their
children
until
they're
21
years
old.
and
the
possibility
of
interpretation
of
that
statute
within
the
terms
of
the
decree
then
i
dont
think
that
could
be
read
as
having
agreed
that
the
age
of
majority
would
be
the
controlling
age.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
and
then
--
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
no,
i
could
not
read
that
case
that
way
your
honor.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
i
mean
the
supreme
courts
opinion.
well,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggests,
i
think
the
court
did
do
this
or
decide
this
case
on
constitutional
grounds
and
statutory
interpretation.
and
its
that
--
on
that
basis
and
which
were
challenging
the
statute
and
the
decision
of
the
utah
supreme
court.
of
course
the
age
of
majority
statute
as
such
cuts
both
ways.
i
recognize
that.
it
has
some
effects
other
than
in
the
support
money
area
in
which
we
are
not
necessarily
concerned
with,
but
which
possibly
have
to
be
anticipated.
it
offers
benefits
to
one
and
detriments
to
another
in
different
kinds
of
situations,
but
this
proceeding
of
course
is
directed
solely
at
the
application
or
primarily
that
the
application
of
that
statute
to
the
support
statutes.
the
utah
supreme
court
used
some
rather
traditional
rationalizations
to
uphold
the
statute.
one
of
them
being
that
its
a
mans
primary
responsibility
to
provide
a
home.
this
was
the
breadwinner
argument
which
was
rejected
by
the
court
i
believe
in
frontiero
case.
they
indicated
also
that
the
son
needs
a
good
education
or
training.
i
submit
that
the
daughter
also
needs
one
and
also
the
classic
argument
that
girls
tend
to
mature
earlier
than
boys
which
again
is
one
of
the
arguments
made
in
some
of
the
previous
cases,
particularly
reed
against
reed.
i
think
in
that
case,
the
idaho
supreme
court
sought
to
rationalize
its
statute
on
the
basis
that
men
were
more
qualified
to
be
personal
representatives
than
women
were.
and
the
fourth
rationalization
of
the
court
was
that
girls
tend
to
marry
earlier
which
is
not
a
rationalization
at
all
because
you
can't
tell
which
is
cause
and
which
is
effect,
whether
the
fact
that
they
marry
earlier
comes
from
the
fact
that
they
may
be
denied
the
support
that
is
given
to
the
male
children.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
thats
right.
all
children
reach
their
majority
on
marriage
under
the
statute.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
of
either
sex.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
tying
to
find
the
legislative
rationalization
for
a
statute
like
this
is
difficult
because
the
utah
legislature
has
approached
this
various
things
differently
with
respect
to
the
ages
at
which
male
children
and
female
children
reach
the
majority.
for
instance,
in
other
legislation
and
in
constitutional
provisions
of
utah,
males
and
females
at
the
same
ages
have
the
right
to
vote
and
hold
office,
the
right
to
serve
as
jurors,
the
right
to
practice
law,
and
make
dispositions
of
properties
by
will.
theyre
both
subject
to
juvenile
court
jurisdiction
at
the
same
ages.
automobile
licensing,
the
general
duty
of
support
set
out
in
the
general
support
statute
and
to
public
assistance
under
the
public
assistance
program.
i
point
these
out
primarily
to
suggest
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
in
the
total
legislative
scheme
that
suggests
a
view
on
the
part
of
the
legislature
that
the
female
children
are
more
competent
at
a
particular
age
than
the
males.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
the
original
statute?
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
1852.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
i
think
that
“settlement
women”
is
in
1847,
they
came
into
the
valley
so
that
was
maybe
five
years
later.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes,
i've
--
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
i
did
mention
shevin
--
kahn
versus
shevin
but
only
briefly.
i
would
like
to
say
this
about
the
cases
together.
i've
tried
to
find
if
i
could
a
common
thread
in
them
and
i
think
the
one
common
thread
i
can
find
is
that
the
surmises
and
the
speculations
with
respect
to
legislative
intention
and
some
of
the
deference
paid
to
the
judgments
of
the
legislature
has
been
subjected
to
a
closer
look
that
even
in
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
upheld
the
sex-based
discrimination
or
the
sex-based
classification
i
should
say,
it
has
taken
a
look
at
the
basis
on
which
the
statute
is
sought
to
be
upheld
and
has
made
a
careful
analysis
of
what
the
state
is
trying
to
accomplish
and
the
methods
by
which
is
doing
it.
i
think
that
would
be
true
of
the
--
not
only
of
kahn
versus
shevin,
but
of
the
geduldig
versus
aiello
and
also
schlesinger
versus
ballard
in
cases
where
the
sex-based
classification
has
been
upheld
or
at
least
the
classification
which
is
contended
to
be
sex-based.
now,
we
have
in
this
case
too
as
we
have
--
the
court
has
had
before
in
a
number
of
others
that
we
dont
have
any
legislative
history
that
gives
any
guidance
as
to
what
the
legislature
had
in
mind.
there
are
couple
of
points
that
have
been
raised
in
the
briefs
with
respect
to
the
standing
for
instance
of
the
plaintiff
here
to
bring
this
action.
a
recent
utah
case
is
reaffirmed
what
i
pointed
out
earlier
and
that
is
that
the
parent
who
has
paid
the
support
money
is
the
one
who
or
has
supported
the
child
is
the
one
who
has
the
right
to
receive
the
support.
that
recent
case
was
decided
in
october
of
last
year,
it's
baggs
versus
anderson
in
528
p.
2d
141,
that
was
since
the
briefs
were
filed
in
this
case.
moreover,
the
court
here
has
held
that
the
one
challenging
statute
need
not
necessarily
be
a
member
of
the
class.
the
most
recent
one
i
believe
involving
the
woman
jurors
and
their
need
to
request
jury
service
in
taylor
versus
louisiana.
the
question
of
mootness
has
been
raised
and
being
contended
that
the
daughters
now
over
the
age
of
21
years
and
so
that
the
question
is
moot.
however,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
still
has
a
question
of
her
right
to
$2,700.00
riding
on
the
outcome
which
would
seem
not
to
make
the
case
moot.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
bryce
e.
roe
yes
sir,
one
statement
if
the
court
please
and
that
is
on
this
estoppel
matter.
the
decisions
just
werent
that
clear
prior
to
this
case
as
to
whether
the
support
obligation
ended
at
age
18
following
the
enactment
of
the
support
act
and
there
were
very
--
i
did
not
really
find
any
decisions
even
prior
to
that
in
which
there
was
a
clear
holding
as
to
the
age
at
which
it
ended.
but
it
was
the
argument
we
made
to
the
utah
supreme
court
with
respect
to
that
was
that
the
support
money
payment
ended
at
majority,
at
common
law
because
thats
when
the
duty
of
a
parent
to
support
ended,
and
when
the
legislature
changed
that,
then
it
was
a
rational
basis
for
changing
the
application
to
the
divorce
proceedings.
thank
you.
