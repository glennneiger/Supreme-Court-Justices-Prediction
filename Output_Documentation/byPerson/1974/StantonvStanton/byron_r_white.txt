justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact,
it
means
that
in
this
case
under
the
state
decision
support
for
the
daughter
stopped?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
would
not
have
and
would
not
stop
for
a
son?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
court
construed
that
the
decree
as
meaning
support
until
they
reached
the
majority
and
then
as
a
matter
of
law
under
the
statute
that
when
18
for
the
girl?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
the
agreement
--
what
if
the
stipulation
had
said,
“support
until
their
majority?”
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
then
they
wouldnt
if
they
have
said,
“if
thats
the
daughters
name
they
would
have
said
18
in
parenthesis
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
thats
the
one
they
would
have
agreed
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
said
the
majority
in
the
state
statute
specified
what
the
majority
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
its
arguable
thats
--
it
is
arguable
that
the
supreme
court
of
utah
has
equated
your
situation
with
my
supposition
in
that
when
you
agreed
just
to
provide
support
that
meant
under
state
law
until
their
majority
which
in
turn
meant
until
18
and
21?
