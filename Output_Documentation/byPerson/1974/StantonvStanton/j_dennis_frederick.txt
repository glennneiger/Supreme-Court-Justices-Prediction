mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
has
the
language
of
the
very
statute
which
is
being
challenged
here
and
might
just
state
briefly
the
language
is
that
the
period
of
minority
extends
in
males
to
the
age
of
21
years
and
in
females
to
that
of
18
years
but
all
minors
obtain
the
majority
by
marriage.
i
think
that
there
are
four
critical
elements
or
four
critical
problems
with
the
appellants
case
here,
a
couple
of
which
had
been
touched
on
in
the
questions
asked
to
counsel
in
his
argument.
i
think
first,
as
this
court
is
well
aware,
the
appellant
here
is
not
in
any
representative
capacity
on
behalf
of
her
daughter.
she
is
here
in
her
own
right
alleging
that
the
statute
in
fact
discriminates
against
her
as
a
class,
that
being
the
class
of
mothers
of
daughters
in
the
18
to
21
age
group.
i
submit
that
at
this
juncture
she
has
no
standing
as
in
fact
not
only
is
she
admittedly
not
a
member
of
the
class
which
the
statute
is
designed
to
affect
that
is
persons
attaining
majority,
but
she
is
indeed
not
even
a
member
of
the
class
which
she
claims
as
being
discriminated
against
as
in
fact
the
daughter
in
question
here
turned
21
over
a
year
ago.
the
second
point
which
i
believe
has
a
very
direct
correct
bearing
on
this
--
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
that
is
correct
your
honor.
however,
my
--
i
submit
to
the
court
that
thats
not
before
us
here.
that's
a
claim
for
moneys
paid
and
not
in
fact
a
bearing
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
it
does
your
honor.
the
record
does
reflect
that
the
daughter
did
in
fact
reside
with
the
mother
for
most
if
not
all
of
the
time
in
question
here.
i
would
however
submit
that
even
if
the
court
finds
that
she
has
established
her
right
which
is
in
jeopardy
here
or
has
established
that
she
will
sustain
a
substantial
injury
that
she
is
estopped
to
now
claim,
make
that
claim
as
the
court.
and
the
record
establishes
without
question
the
decree
of
divorce
entered
in
this
matter
in
november
of
1960
was
in
fact
a
stipulated
decree
of
divorce
and
a
consent
decree
was
entered.
both
parties
involved
in
that
matter
were
in
fact
represented
by
counsel
and
i
submit
that
the
appellant
here
is
charged
with
either
actual
or
constructive
knowledge
of
what
the
law
in
utah
was
at
that
time
and
that
in
fact
was
without
question
that
the
support
payments
for
a
daughter
terminate
at
18.
under
the
statute
here
challenged,
she
the
appellant
may
have
contracted
otherwise
but
chose
not
to
do
so
and
this
court
has
long
recognized
the
doctrine
of
equitable
estoppel
and
i
submit
that
here,
the
appellant
is
estopped
to
assert
that
argument.
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
1974,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
$2,700.00
i
believe
is
the
figure.
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
yes
sir.
next
and
i
believe
again
this
is
a
fatal
--
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
yes
your
honor,
in
fact
that
--
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
--
the
point
that
i
am
here
going
to
raise
next,
i
think
there's
no
substantial
federal
question
here.
the
defect
number
one
of
the
statute
that
is
claimed
in
any
event
has
long
since
been
cured
by
as
counsel
stated
the
adoption
by
utah
of
the
uniform
civil
support
act
--
liability
for
support
act.
that
was
adopted
in
1957
and
requires
not
only
fathers
but
mothers
to
give
support
in
appropriate
circumstances
to
their
children
until
they
arrive
at
the
age
of
21.
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
it
is,
yes
sir
it
is.
it
has
no
relationship
to
the
holdings
of
the
utah
supreme
court
with
regard
to
when
support
terminates.
its
in
the
nature
of
i
suppose
of
what
we
commonly
call
proper
statutes.
but
neither
the
appellant
here
nor
the
daughter
have
seen
fit
to
avail
themselves
at
that
alternative
state
remedy.
they
have
chosen
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
challenge
the
statute
on
which
our
supreme
court
has
determined
to
support
shall
end.
a
further
aspect
of
this
argument
is
that
this
is
a
political
question.
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
absolutely.
thats
absolutely
the
case
under
the
statute
--
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
we
dont
dispute
that.
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
she
would
have
the
alternative
remedy
of
either
through
the
state
welfare
department
or
in
the
daughters
own
name
to
pursue
the
father
has
is
an
obligee
for
reimbursement.
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
well,
he
would
either
be
determined
i
take
it
in
that
proceeding
to
owe
that
support
which
has
been
paid
for
the
daughter.
hes
only
co-responsible
with
the
mother
for
the
support
of
that
daughter.
if
however,
it
were
to
come
through
payments
by
the
utah
state
welfare
department,
then
he
would
be
obligated
to
reimburse
the
welfare
department.
at
this
particular
time,
i
think
its
a
very
appropriate
to
state
that
there
are
currently
pending
before
the
utah
state
legislature,
three
separate
bills
which
have
a
bearing
on
this
issue.
one
of
which
is
the
equal
rights
amendment,
secondarily
either
--
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
i'm
sorry
to
hear
that
your
honor.
mr.
j.
dennis
frederick
i
have
not
heard
that
news.
in
any
event,
there
are
two
other
bills
pending
which
would
seek
to
make
the
age
of
majority
uniform,
one
of
which
would
make
the
age
of
majority
21
uniformly
and
the
other
18.
but
in
any
event,
while
these
matters
are
pending
before
the
utah
state
legislature
it
seems
to
me
that
this
acknowledgment
of
the
political
nature
of
this
type
of
question
was
appropriately
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
powell
in
his
concurring
opinion
of
frontiero.
the
equal
rights
amendment
which
if
adopted
will
resolve
the
substance
to
this
precise
question
--
excuse
me
has
been
approved
by
the
congress
and
submitted
for
ratification
by
the
states.
if
the
amendment
is
duly
adopted
it
will
represent
the
will
of
the
people
accomplished
in
a
manner
proscribed
by
the
constitution.
by
acting
prematurely
and
unnecessarily
as
i
view
it,
the
court
has
assumed
the
decisional
responsibility
at
the
very
time
when
state
legislature
is
functioning
within
the
traditional
democratic
process,
are
debating
the
proposed
amendment.
it
seems
to
me
that
by
reaching
out
to
preempt
by
judicial
action
a
major
political
decision
which
is
currently
in
process
of
resolution
does
not
reflect
appropriate
respect
for
the
duty
proscribe
legislative
processes.
in
addition,
i
would
submit
that
the
recent,
most
recent
cases
by
this
court
dealing
with
the
so-called
sex-based
discrimination
matters
would
provide
that
there
in
fact
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
substantiation
of
this
statute
here
under
question.
that
in
fact
the
courts
in
kahn
versus
shevin,
this
court,
geduldig
versus
aiello
and
schlesinger
versus
ballard
case
has
stated
that
the
courts
will
not
or
should
not
substitute
their
social
and
economic
beliefs
for
the
judgment
of
the
legislature
if
there
is
a
fair
and
substantial
relation
to
the
legislative
objective
to
be
sought
or
to
be
advanced
the
statute
will
stand.
in
this
particular
instance,
i
submit
that
the
state
objective
to
be
established
or
to
be
sought
is
to
pinpoint
an
objectively
identifiable
point
in
time
when
a
member
of
society
is
given
the
responsibilities
and
benefits
of
adulthood.
it
is
to
set
an
age
at
which
the
disabilities
of
infancy
are
removed.
the
utah
legislature
has
made
the
determination
that
certain
segments
of
the
society
are
more
capable
of
coping
with
these
rights
and
responsibilities,
namely
married
persons
and
females
over
the
age
of
18
and
males
over
21
and
a
view
has
traditional
has
been,
correct
or
not,
that
a
woman
and
matures
emotionally
and
physically
at
an
earlier
age
than
men.
this
statute
is
merely
the
codification
of
that
traditional
view
and
i
submit
that
it
does
provide
a
fair
and
substantial
means
to
promote
a
state
objective
and
for
that
--
those
reasons
i
submit
the
statute
must
be
sustained
