mr.
scott
p.
crampton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
start
at
the
outset
and
try
to
put
in
focus
our
understanding
of
these
statutes
that
we
have
before
you.
the
basic
purpose
of
course
is
to
avoid
the
so-called
"incorporated
pocket
book."
congress
determined
that
stockholder
should
not
be
permitted
to
accumulate
idle
funds
in
a
corporation
in
order
to
avoid
dividend
taxes
that
they
would
otherwise
have
to
pay
themselves.
as
we
look
at
the
statute,
there
is
a
two
fold
test
here.
the
first,
section
531
imposes
the
tax
on
the
accumulated
taxable
income.
this
is
an
additional
tax
on
income
for
a
given
taxable
year.
it
applies
only
to
that
income
which
is
permitted
to
accumulate
in
that
particular
year.
the
income
involved
is
determined
basically
from
the
books
of
the
corporation
and
it
is
determined
in
much
the
same
way
as
your
regular
corporate
income
is
determined
but
then
modified
for
certain
adjustments.
and
so
far
as
we
see
it,
this
is
simple
book
keeping,
you
come
up
with
income
that's
determined
the
way
everyone
understands
it.
if
you
have
no
income,
you
have
no
problem
under
this
statute.
if
income
does
exist
though,
when
you've
done
this
computing
and
it
is
not
distributed
as
dividends
to
the
stockholders,
then
you
look
to
see
if
this
income
can
be
distributed
without
a
hardship
to
the
company.
the
statute
speaks
of
the
earnings
and
profits
being
permitted
to
accumulate
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business.
and
i
think
the
word
"needs"
here
is
the
keyword
for
our
second
test.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
isn't
economic
test.
here,
the
statute
departs
from
concepts
of
taxable
income
that
we
know
under
bookkeeping
and
it
requires
us
to
measure
the
resources
of
the
corporation
against
its
needs.
the
case
is
construing
the
statute
refer
to
this
as
"net
liquid
assets."
if
you
take
your
current
assets
and
your
current
liabilities
and
you
see
what
are
the
economic
resources
that
the
corporation.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes,
sir.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
those
are
read
assets
that
can
be
readily
converted
to
cash,
probably
inventory
receivables
things
like
that
that
would
come
into
income
within
a
year
or
less
than
a
year.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
that
would
probably
a
liquid
asset
then
assume
in
your
premise.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
you
have
to
determine
the
value
of
these
properties
as
the
same
way
we
determine
values
in
many
other
areas
like
you
would
for
estate
tax
purposes
in
the
question
of
condemnation.
you
have
a
question
here
it's
a
fact
question,
that
the
court
would
have
to
consider.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
think
your
honor
in
the
situation
you
gave
or
you
said
it
was
readily
saleable,
i
doubt
if
you'd
have
much
of
evaluation
problem
there,
if
there
somebody
wanting
to
buy
this
property
you
probably
have
pretty
good
idea
what
the
sales
price
would
be.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
true.
but
that's
true
of
your
--
of
any
security
like
the
xerox
stock
here
it
have
to
be
sold
or
some
fluctuation
in
the
market
from
the
day
to
day.
but
we
don't
think
you
need
to
get
into
that
much
of
a
refinement.
you
look
to
see
whether
or
not
there
is
current
assets
here
sufficient
that
the
corporation
could
pay
out
these
earnings
and
profits
without
disturbing
its
normal
needs.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no
sir,i
don't
know.
i've
got
it
here
but
i
know
it's
a
volatile
stock
in
74'
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
don't
think
you
pick
a
day
on
this
as
we
view
the
case.
your
honor,
you
would
look
at
the
situation
over
the
year
and
if
there's
a
minimum
value
of
55
certainly
that
would
be
i
think
a
realistic
value
to
take.
if
that
is
the
law
because
we
are
--
we're
not
trying
to
force
a
conversion
here.
we're
just
saying
it
you
know
in
a
day
to
day
market
place
you've
got
some
assets
here
and
if
you're
sure
that
you
can
realize
at
least
$55.00
of
share
on
it,
then
that's
something
we
could
look
at.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
would
think
that
would
be
reasonable.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been
refined
to
that
point.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
we
have
stipulated
what
the
values
were
with
counsel.
we
were
trying
to
get
out
of
the
case
some
of
these
detail
factual
things
and
we
have
agreed
with
counsel
for
the
taxpayer
that
these
were
the
values
and
we
have
reduced
those
values
by
the
capital
gains
tax
and
by
the
brokerage
made
of
points,
so
as
far
as
this
case
is
concern,
we
have
hard
figures
that
these
are
the
fair
market
values
that
both
parties
agreed
they
could
use
and
then
we
have
the
cost
figures
which
were
equally
refer.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
oh,
i
think
cost
clearly.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
not
in
my
mind
but
i
do
know
that
most
accountants
will
also
and
this
taxpayer
did.
they
showed
the
market
value.
i
think
at
the
end
of
the
year
as
not
quite
a
footnote
but
parenthetical
addition
to
their
balance
sheet.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
you
certainly
--
they
wanted
to
explain
very
carefully
how
you
determine
that
this
was
the
value
you
were
putting
on
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
true.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
agree.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
it's
our
view
that
the
rule
works
both
ways
if
you
bought
at
the
higher
figures,
your
honor
suggest
and
now
it
is
not
worth
that
then
it's
the
existing
market
value
that
you
look
at
in
determining
the
needs
of
the
business,
and
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
national
grocery
case
which
we
referred
in
our
briefs,
in
that
case,
they
had
earnings
i
think
of
some
$800,000.00
and
then
admitted
security
losses
of
$2
million
and
the
court
said,
"you
do
look
at
the
present
value
of
those
securities."
and
there's
a
quotation
in
our
brief
it's
quite
clear
and
i
will
come
into
it
in
a
minute
but
the
court
then
went
and
had
impose
the
tax
because
as
you
look
over
a
10-year
average
the
had
accumulated
earnings
and
profits
or
something
like
$5
million
that
had
never
paid
a
dividend.
but
the
court
there
announced
the
rule
and
we
think
this
is
just
the
opposite
of
it
and
we
certainly
say
the
rule
works
both
ways.
now,
i
think
the
pivotal
question
here,
is
how
the
resources
of
business
should
be
measured?
the
counsel
for
taxpayer
has
set
forth
some
of
the
facts
but
i'd
like
to
summarize
them
briefly
against
the
statute
as
we've
indicated
the
facts
that
have
been
stipulated.
this
corporation
had
earnings
after
federal
income
taxes
of
about
$180,000.00
in
1965
and
almost
$400,000.00
in
1966.
it
paid
less
than
a
third
of
these
amounts
out
in
dividends.
in
1965,
it
paid
$49,000.00
in
cash
dividend
and
distributed
870
shares
of
xerox
stock,
in
1966,
paid
out
$50,000.00
in
cash
dividends
and
a
10%
stock
dividend.
its
reasonable
needs
as
i
say
have
been
stipulated
for
1965
they
need
at
almost
$2
million,
i
mean,
a
$1,200,000.00
and
in
1966,
they
needed
practically
a
million
and
a
half,
and
these
are
liquid
assets
taken
at
book
value
and
the
parties
has
agreed
that
these
amounts
equal
in
needs
of
the
business.
if
--
these
are
the
liquid
assets
and
they
are
the
needs
if
you
look
at
the
book
figures.
now
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no.
these
are
the
assets
on
the
books
i
have
indicated,
i
think
they
would
be
realized
within
a
year
and
the
payables
within
a
year.
it's
the
readily
receivable
things
that
can
be
converted
into
cash
if
you
need
to,
and
that
brings
us
right
to
the
point
of
how
you
value
the
xerox
stock.
we
have
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
under
these
facts,
there
been
no
liability
at
all.
we
agree
with
that
and
i
think
that
the
stipulations
were
designed
to
point
that
up
and
the
real
question
is,
we
have
also
stipulated
that
after
allowance
for
the
capital
gain's
tax
and
the
brokerage
fees
that
the
liquid
assets
of
this
corporation
are
practically
double
the
figures
that
we
stipulated
as
the
corporate
needs.
the
liquid
assets,
if
you
look
at
fair
market
value
or
$2
million
and
two
some
in
1965
over
$3
million
in
1966,
and
here,
76%
of
the
voting
stock
was
owned
by
ivan
allen
sr.
and
ivan
allen
jr.
and
because
of
that,
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
determine
this
assessment.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
point
out
in
continuing
our
argument
that
if
the
resources
of
this
corporation
had
been
entirely
reflected
in
plant
and
equipment
then
there
would
obviously
be
no
liability
here
for
the
unreasonable
accumulation.
and
i
think
counsel
for
the
tax
payer
has
agreed
in
his
oral
argument
that
the
money
that
they
invested
in
the
xerox
stock
is
in
fact
extra
money
that
the
corporation
really
didn't
need
other
than
perhaps
the
$100,000.00
of
cost.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
right.
yes,
i
think
anything
if
they
can
really
firm
it
down
that
they
plan
to
move
the
plant
or
expand
it
or
do
something
like
that
they
have
a
solid
reasonably
anticipated
need
that
would
qualify
under
the
exemption.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
because
it
would
not
be
a
net
liquid
asset,
it
wouldn't
be
readily
realizable.
i
think
they
do
make
a
distinction.
you
have
to
look
at
what
your
current
situation
is
and
if
you
had
it
tied
up
in
long
term
investments
like
that
i
don't
believe
any
of
the
case
to
say
that
it
would
consider
that.
now,
perhaps
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
i
assume
if
they
kept
investing
let's
say
hundreds
of
thousand
of
dollars
and
land
just
to
perhaps
a
thought
of
avoiding
this
when
maybe
the
commissioner
might
step
in.
but
basically
they
have
been
looking
at
liquid
assets.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no.
but
i
think
the
case
law
has
pretty
well
developed
that
and
that
is
the
theory
i
think
back
of
it
is
that
if
you
have
the
money
invested
in
such
a
way
that
you
really
can't
get
your
hands
on
it
then
nobody
could
criticize
you
for
not
paying
the
dividends
that
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
--
otherwise
it
would
be
due.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
so
and
that
was
why
i
qualified
my
answer
to
the
chief
justice
that
i
thought
that
this
became
obvious.
the
commissioner
might
very
well
move
in.
you
shouldn't
just
let
them
as
you
say
by
portraits
or
by
land
that
they
don't
anticipate
ever
using
at
all.
but
i
think
as
a--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
the
national
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
you're
right
but
the
national
grocery
company
case
that
we
mentioned
earlier
focused
on
the
liquidity
of
the
asset
pointing
out
that
the
securities
that
were
really
liquid
had
dropped
the
value
to
$2
million
and
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
about
right,
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
been
stipulated
and
they
are
--
everybody
knows
xerox
stock
is
liquid
and
that
is
the
principle
asset
that
they
had
here.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
that's
true
but
i
think
part
of
the
answer
to
this
problem
of
putting
your
securities
or
assets
in
long
term
investments
are
that
probably
the
board
of
directors
as
a
practical
matter
wouldn't
want
to
do
that
because
most
corporations
closely
held.
they
probably
want
to
have
their
assets
where
they
can
reach
them
or
readily
convert
them
if
they
need
to.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
right.
but
even
i
think
a
lot
of
people
incorporated
pocketbooks
may
not
want
to
put
their
money
into
land
if
they
feel
they
couldn't
get
it
out
for
15
or
20
years
and
anywhere
near
they
put
it
in.
but
i
do
coming
back
to
this
case,
i
think
we
have
stipulated
that
question
out
of
the
case
and
stipulated
that
we
do
have
liquid
assets
here
and
as
i
say
we
can.
this
corporation
could
realize
--
could
convert
this
of
need
to
or
borrow
against
that
are
utilize
these
assets
to
pay
the
dividends.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
think
it
is
and
i
think
--
i
mean
that's
what
the
cases
of
the
lower
courts
that
have
considered
this
have
held
that
time
and
time
again.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
that
is
true
but
i
don't
think
that
your
land
--
your
problems
with
land
usually
i
would
say
it's
a
practical
matter
much
more
complicated
than
they
are
with
the
securities
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
so
up
and
even
though
you
think
you've
got
a
great
bargain
in
land
you
may
have
title
problems
or
questions
of
state
regulations
zoning
and
things
like
that
that
complicates
your
life
if
you're
putting
your
assets
in
the
land.
but
you
certainly
don't
have
those
with
listed
securities.
coming
back
to
that
national
grocery
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
pardon
me.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
readily
available.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
and
it's
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
it's
subject
to
being
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
can
be
met
from
the
available
resources.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
mr.
powell.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
i
would,
in
answer
your
question,
i
think
i
would
have
suggested
that
the
corporation
look
at
that
movement
of
the
xerox
stock
during
the
year.
and
if
they
had
bought
it,
i
forgot
what
the
price
was
per
share
of
it
in
your
example
supposing
they
had
bought
it
five
and
it
never
got
below
35
and
they
had
this
type
of
earnings
and
they
had
this
volume
of
shares
so
that
they
had
if
you
use
the
value
of
35,
there
were
maybe
two
or
three
times
above
their
earnings
i
would
certainly
suggest
that
either
they
declare
their
earnings
as
a
dividend
or
do
so
realizing
that
they
would
risk
a
tax
under
the
penalty
provision
here
the
accumulated
earnings
tax.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
i
think
you
look
at
that
the
end
of
the
year.
you
would
see
where
the
movement
has
been
during
the
year
and
i
think
that
your
bottom
would
be
the
lowest
thing
would
be
the
factor
that
you
would
really
consider
if
you
want
to
be
safe.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
because
i
don't
think
the
case
say
you
take
in
to
consideration
real
estate
unless
an
example
you
gave
me
you
could
establish
that
it
was
readily
marketable.
but
here
again,
i
think
you
look
at
what
the
assets
are
available
for
--
to
pay
the
dividends.
can
you
pay
the
dividends
without
disrupting
a
normal
life
of
this
corporation
in
the
serious
way?
and
if
you
have
liquid
assets,
the
question
is;
why
shouldn't
the
dividends
be
paid?
i
would
like
to
--
if
i
might
just
mention
briefly
the
one
statement
from
that
national
grocery
case
that
i
think
does
state
the
position
of
this
court
on
the
question.
it
said
depreciation
and
any
of
the
assets
is
evidence
to
be
considered
in
determining
the
issue
of
fact
whether
the
accumulation
of
profits
was
an
excess
of
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business.
and
it's
near
as
i
know
that
quoted
statement
has
never
been
questioned
or
repudiated.
and
if
you
do
look
at
depreciation
in
the
assets
then
it
seems
to
us
that
the
economic
test
applies
when
assets
are
going
down
that
you're
certainly
justified
in
looking
at
it
when
they
go
up.
the
stipulation
as
we
mentioned
shows
that
this
xerox
stock
had
a
cost
of
$1,200.00
for
the
fiscal
year
66
and
it
had
a
fair
market
values
the
party
stipulated
of
almost
$2.5
million
so
that
that's
20
or
25
times
the
original
cost.
the
margin
here
is
such
that
this
corporation
could
certainly
have
paid
the
dividend
of
$344,000.00
that
year
without
any
substantial
loss
of
economic
muscles
as
we
view
the
situation.
i
was
asked
yesterday
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
it
might
have,
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
right.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes,
they
could
but
to
pay
out
--
if
they
paid
out
the
xerox
stock
it
would
come
out
at
their
cost
and
the
tax
payers
would've
picked
it
up
market
value
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
--
and
i
think
that
that
would've
been
--
they
wouldn't
do
that
as
a
practical
matter.
i
don't
think
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes,
just
to
a
few
shares.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
870
i
think.
i
was
asked
yesterday
about
the
considerations
for
accounting
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
believe
the
corporations
would've
--
had
to
pay
a
tax
on
to
see
the
dividends
at
fair
market
value
when
they
receive
the
shares.
stockholders,
pardon
me,
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
at
fair
market
value.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that's
right.
but
if
they
distributed
the
stock
they'd
be
picking
up
--
they
get
a
$100,000.00
credit
and
pick
up
$2.5
million
of
ordinary
income
or
as
i
don't
think
that
the
--
if
the
stockholders
are
using
this
corporation
or
concerned
about
it
they
would
not
probably
want
to
pick
up
that
kind
of
income
in
a
one
year.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
on
a
block
that
big
the
commission
wouldn't
be
maybe
1%
or
2%.
we
have
stipulated
here
i
think
it's
6%
commission
rate
but
that
was
being
liberal.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
we
thought
and
i
think
so
and
on
a
block
of
that
thing.
if
i
could
touch
as
briefly
on
this
question
of
this
securities
exchange
commission
situation,
it
seems
to
us
that
any
financial
statements
that
might
be
submitted
to
the
security
and
exchange
commission
or
for
accounting
purposes
are
usually
designed
to
reflect
a
financial
condition
for
a
fixed
period.
they
do
not
usually
look
at
external
sources
for
supplemental
information
such
as
evaluations.
and
the
question
here
is
whether
the
corporation
is
in
a
position
to
distribute
these
current
earnings
as
dividends.
if
the
corporation
contends
that
it
has
business
needs
then
as
we've
mentioned
we
look
at
the
available
resources
and
this
requires
a
measuring
of
assets
during
the
period.
their
actual
cost
some
years
earlier
is
really
we
see
--
we
believe
irrelevant
to
this
economic
examination
of
the
period
in
time.
and
i
think
the
correctness
of
this
position
is
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
you
use
value
if
it
is
less
than
cost
in
determining
total
resources
as
this
court
has
done
in
the
national
grocery
case.
if
the
cost
were
in
fact
the
test
you
might
find
a
situation
where
the
tax
payer
had
assets
on
its
books
considerably
higher
than
their
existing
value
at
the
time
and
they
really
didn't
have
them.
in
summary,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
statute
requires
a
consideration
of
economic
needs
of
the
business
if
the
corporation
has
net
liquid
assets
substantial
and
excess
of
economic
needs.
it
should
distribute
its
earnings
or
pay
the
tax.
it
certainly
should
not
be
permitted
to
avoid
the
tax
by
simply
investing
funds
in
readily
marketable
security.
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
was
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
