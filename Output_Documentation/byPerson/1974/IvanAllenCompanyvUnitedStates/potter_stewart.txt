what
was
the
government's
theory,
i
thought
it
was
--
first
of
all
i
don't
think
that
the
government
claims
at
all
that
this
unrealized
appreciation
is
itself
earnings
and
profits.
but
that
the
government's
theory
is
that
with
the
existence
of
this
large
unrealized
profit
in
the
investments
you
made
in
this
company
that
your
other
earnings
and
profits
were
more
than
available
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
business
and
therefore,
where
you
stand
were
declared,
you're
in
trouble
under
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
say
you
should've
sold
your
stock
or
had
to
sell
your
stock
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
the
shareholders'
basis
on
receipt
of
dividend
in
kind
as
the
basis
for
each
share,
the
corporation's
cost
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
dividend,
the
market
value
and
what's
the
--
and
then
his
basis
if
he
later
sells
at
this
market
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
liquid
assets
taken
at
book
value?
what
are
you
talking
about
now,
the
earnings
and
profits
of
that
year?
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
can
see
that
--
have
there
been
no
appreciation
in
value
of
the
xerox
stock?
there
could've
been
no
violation
of
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
neither
the
statute
under
regulation
saying
anything
about
liquid
assets?
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
holder
--
if
the
whole
fulcrum
of
decision
whether
or
not
the
assets
would
liquid,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
perhaps
provide
a
bit
many
opportunities
to
violated
the
--
both
the
letter
and
the
spirit
of
section
532
if
corporations
should
go
off
and
buy
rembrandt
portraits
and
things
like
that.
that
would
be
and
certainly
an
incorporated
pocketbook
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
maybe,
is
there
any
decision
of
this
court
that
says
that
the
test
is
whether
the
assets
are
liquid
or
easily
convertible
into
cash?
justice
potter
stewart
nothing
in
either
of
the
statute
of
regulations
that
say
a
word
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
and
realized
depreciation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
that
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
was
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
isn't
that
--
that's
about
all
it
said,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
would've
had,
in
order
to
do
that
it
would've
had
needed
to
sell
part
of
the
stock
or
borrow
against
it
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
we're
talking
about
liquidity,
if
we're
talking
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
cash
dividends.
justice
potter
stewart
the
market
value.
justice
potter
stewart
although
they
did
do
it
in
the
previous
year,
do
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
as
to
a
few
shares.
justice
potter
stewart
why
would
that
be
disadvantageous
to
do?
if
the
corporation
paid
it
out
any
kind
and
under
their
regulation
as
its
cost
and
at
least
would've
been
a
realizable
or
taxable
gain.
they
would
just
to
pay
it
out
at
cost
and
the
shareholders
would've
received
it
at
fair
market
value
with
fair
market
value
as
shareholders
basis
in
the
event
of
subsequent
sale.
why
would
that
have
been
disadvantage
economically?
justice
potter
stewart
at
fair
market?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
ordinary
income?
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
be
true
of
cash
too?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
unrealistically
high,
i
think.
