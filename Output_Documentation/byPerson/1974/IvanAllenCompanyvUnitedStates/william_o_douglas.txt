justice

o.
douglas
mr.
mcalpin,
before
you
go
on,
you're
talking
about
unrealized
appreciation
investment
in
stock
market?
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
of
what
dates
are
we
talking
about
that
the
government
take
year
in
market
value?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
year
in
as
i
recall.
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
the
record
show
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
the
high
and
low
market
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
mcalpin,
i'm
asking
you
another
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
the
record
show
the
high
and
low
market
price
of
xerox
in
each
of
fiscal
years
in
question?
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
taking
into
account
the
capital
gain
stocks?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
cost
of
conversion
is
different
from
the
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
mcalpin,
on
page
55,
i
think
there
is
a
stipulation
about
the
cost
of
converting
and
i
suppose
had
the
corporation
on
december
30th
or
two
days
before
the
end
of
the
taxable
year
or
maybe
on
fiscal
year
basis
yes
june
30th.
in
june
28th
if
it
had
liquidated
the
xerox
stock
without
the
net
figure
after
capital
gain
and
capital
gain
tax
and
brokerage
commission,
you
wouldn't
be
here
arguing
then
there
would
be
an
improper
accumulation
of
surplus?
justice
william
o.
douglas
had
you
converted
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
which
is
a
critical
word?
justice
william
o.
douglas
incidentally,
it
is
agreed
that
the
xerox
stock
is
completely
marketable
it
is
liquid,
i
take
it
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
this
has
to
be
your
answer
what
you
just
gave
to
mr.
justice
white
has
to
be
your
answer
really
and
what
your
opinion
your
case
on
is
that
it
is
unrealized
and
liquidated
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
and
you
want
the
privilege
of
a
business
judgment
and
as
to
one
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
crampton.
justice
william
o.
douglas
what
do
you
mean
by
liquid
assets?
how
did
you
define
them
for
this
purpose?
justice
william
o.
douglas
suppose
you
had
a
highly
marketable
piece
of
real
estate
that
you
can
sell
any
day.
justice
william
o.
douglas
right,
how
would
you
determine
the
value?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
that
means
that
the
government
would
get
an
appraiser
and
the
taxpayer
would
get
an
appraiser
and
they
would
be
miles
apart
and
they
compromise
somewhere
in
the
middle
which
is
what
is
usually
happens.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
have
to
sell
it
they
would
find
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
recall
what
the
fluctuation
in
xerox
stock
was
in
the
year
1974?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
arranged
according
to
mode
year
from
55
to
and
134.
now,
which
day
would
the
government
pick?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
if
there
was
a
lower
market
value
in
the
fiscal
year
in
question
the
taxpayer
could've
taken
that
for
purposes
of
this
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
the
--
i
thought
you
took
the
market
value
on
the
last
day
of
the
taxpayer's
of
fiscal
year.
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
crampton,
before
you
go
on,
how
would
sound
the
accounting
principles
require
a
corporation
to
carry
the
value
of
this
xerox
stock
at
any
particular
day?
justice
william
o.
douglas
there's
no
question
about
that,
is
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
if
you
file
the
registration
statement
with
the
sec
and
undertook
to
show
your
assets
at
market
you
get
deficiency
immediately,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
there's
nothing
definite,
really
definite
except
cost.
justice
william
o.
douglas
market
value
varies
--
it
can't
vary
in
with
respect
to
stocks
from
day
to
day
very
widely.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
in
any
event
in
this
case
the
assets
are
liquid?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
is
at
various
times
during
the
year?
