mr.
mcalpin,
why
does
an
office
supply
company
buy
a
stock
like
xerox?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
mr.
allen
had
some
money?
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
corporation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
was
a
substitute
for
putting
the
money
in
the
bank?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
even
if
that
doesn't
happen,
isn't
one
of
your
responses
to
justice
white's
earlier
question
that
even
though
you're
not
told
by
the
government
to
liquidate
your
xerox
stock,
if
you
have
to
distribute
all
of
your
earnings
and
profit
to
make
up
operating
needs.
you're
going
to
have
to
liquidate
some
of
your
xerox
stock.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
old
french
saying
that
everything
has
its
price.
you
know,
you
can
take
something
that
doesn't
have
a
--
isn't
traded
on
a
market
and
yet
presumably
if
you
wanted
to
sell
it
you
can
sell
it
and
if
somebody
wants
to
buy
it
they
can
buy
it.
it's
just
a
question
of
getting
together
on
the
price.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unless,
it's
an
incorporative
pocketbook?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
fine
if
liquidity
is
an
important
aspect
of
the
test?
