the
next
case,
ivan
allen
co.
against
the
united
states
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
and
it
concerns
the
so-called
accumulated
earnings
tax
imposed
on
most
corporations.
this
taxpayer,
petitioner,
the
ivan
allen
company
of
atlanta
possessed
a
portfolio
of
listed
and
unlisted
marketable
securities.
these
had
been
purchased
out
of
earnings
in
prior
years
and
it
so
happen
that
throughout
the
tax
years
in
question
here
which
are
fiscal
1965
and
1966.
the
market
value
of
these
securities
had
greatly
exceeded
their
cost
to
the
corporation.
during
those
fiscal
years,
the
taxpayer
had
undistributed
earnings.
and
the
question
is
whether
in
determining
--
the
question
is
whether
in
determining
whether
those
undistributed
earnings
were
improperly
accumulated
within
the
meaning
of
the
tax.
the
securities
in
the
investment
portfolio
are
to
be
valued
at
cost
to
the
corporation
or
whether
their
marketable
figures
could
be
taken
to
account.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
of
course
took
the
latter
position
and
the
taxpayer
obviously
took
the
former.
the
statute
provides
a
rebuttable
presumption
that
a
corporation
that
has
accumulated
earnings
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
does
so,
the
purpose
of
avoiding
the
income
tax
with
respect
to
its
shareholders.
the
internal
revenue
service
applied
this
presumption
and
asserted
deficiencies.
they
were
paid
and
the
corporation
filed
claims
for
refund
and
on
the
denial
of
those
claims,
this
litigation
was
instituted.
the
district
court
held
that
the
readily
marketable
securities
were
to
be
taken
into
account
at
cost.
accordingly,
it
entered
judgment
for
the
taxpayer.
the
fifth
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
because
of
an
apparent
conflict
with
the
case
in
the
fourth
circuit.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
listed
and
readily
marketable
securities
owned
by
the
corporation
and
purchased
out
of
its
earnings
and
profits
are
to
be
taken
into
account
not
at
their
cost
of
the
corporation
but
at
their
net
liquidation
value
for
purposes
of
the
impact
of
the
accumulated
earnings
tax.
this
is
a
narrow
opinion
focusing
primarily
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
but
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
is
affirmed.
i'm
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
stewart.
