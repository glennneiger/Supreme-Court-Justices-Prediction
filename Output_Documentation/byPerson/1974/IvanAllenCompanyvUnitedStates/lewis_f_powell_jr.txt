f.
powell,

now,
limiting
to
our
discussion
yesterday
and
having
in
mind
that
question
by
the
chief
justice
as
to
stock
being
the
equivalent
in
terms
of
liquidity
with
cash,
what
would
you
advise
the
corporation?
what
would
you
have
advised
this
corporation
bearing
in
mind
as
i
noted
yesterday
that
xerox
stock
varied
according
to
one
of
the
manuals
from
35
to
134
last
year?
what
would
you
have
advised
this
company
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
on
your
theory
of
the
law
as
to
when
to
sell
the
stock
or
whether
or
to
sell
it?
and
would
you
have
advised
the
client
that
xerox
stock
at
a
134
was
equivalent
of
cash
when
you
dropped
the
35
before
the
year
was
over?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
do
that
at
the
fiscal
year?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
on
the
last
day
of
your
fiscal
year
you
take
a
look
at
the
market
value
of
the
stock
and
i
think
you
said
yesterday
you
thought
you
could
average
it
or
take
the
low
figure.
what
would
you
do
with
your
real
estate
that
we
talked
about
yesterday,
would
you
get
appraisals?
