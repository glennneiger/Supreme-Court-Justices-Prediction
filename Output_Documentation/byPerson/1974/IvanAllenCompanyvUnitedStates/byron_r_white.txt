justice

white
often
earnings
and
profits
are
not
in
cash.
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
wait
as
minute.
let's
assume
that
the
company
buys
some
stock
at
for
a
$100,000.00
and
it
didn't
enhances
and
that
increases
in
value
10
times
since
it
was
a
million.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
it
is
and
but
the
government
doesn't
contend
you
have
to
pay
any
of
that
out
any
of
that
enhancement
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
--
if
the
next
year
you
have
a
dollars
worth
of
earnings
and
profits
you
had
to
pay
that
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
any
year
and
which
you
have
a
loss
you
don't
have
to
pay
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
doesn't
say
that
certain
that
the
enhancements
of
earnings
and
profits
suppose
must
be
converted
and
paid
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
don't
force
the
conversion.
they
just
say
that
your
current
year's
liquid
asset
--
you
current
year's
earnings
and
profits
must
be
paid
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
you
be
here
making
the
same
argument
if
for
some
reason
or
another
the
company
had
liquidated
its
xerox
stock
and
were
sitting
there
at
the
end
of
the
year
with
the
money
in
the
bank
having
paid
its
capital
against
tax.
wouldn't
you
say
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
wouldn't
you
be
still
be
making
the
argument
that
insofar
as
the
cash
that
you
now
had,
absolute
cash,
reflected
in
enhancement
--
in
stock
value
that
you
wouldn't
--
that
it
could
not
be
and
should
not
be
considered
in
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
my
point.
i
know
you've
agreed
that
that
to
your
stock
costs
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
now
let's
assume
that
the
stock
had
gone
up
to
a
million
dollars
and
you
sold
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright
and
let's
assume
you
sold
it
you
had
the
cash
in
the
bank.
now,
is
that
available
to
measure
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
government
then
could
take
that
into
account?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
going
to
your
earnings
--
it
would
be
part
of
your
earnings
because
it
was
gain,
i
mean,
it
was
earnings,
it
was
income
because
you
sold
the
stock?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
but
now
let's
assume
that
you
paid
the
tax
on
it
that
year
and
you
took
it
in
the
income
that
year.
justice
byron
r.
white
next
year,
you
still
got
the
money
in
the
bank
and
then
you
have
some
more
earnings
and
profits,
must
you
pay
the
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
not
still
accumulated
earnings
and
profits
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
--
and
this
is
unrealized
income?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
understand
the
government
to
be
contending
of
course
we'll
hear
from
them
and
due
course,
but
i
don't
understand
then
to
be
contending
that
this
unrealized
appreciation
is
earnings
and
profits.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
concede
that
it
is
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
have
earnings
and
profits
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
the
government's
position
is
where
this
unrealized
appreciation
of
the
xerox
stock,
those
earnings
and
profits
were
unreasonably
accumulated
if
they
weren't
paid
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
also,
i
should
point
out
that
the
dividends
doesn't
have
to
be
a
cash
dividend.
the
dividend
could've
been
paid
out
in
the
form
of
xerox
of
stock
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
to
your
shareholders.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
thought
that
was
your
point
in
this
case?
