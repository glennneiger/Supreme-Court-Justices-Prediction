mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
you
today
is
in
behalf
for
the
taxpayer
ivan
allen
company.
this
is
a
penalty
tax
case
is
that
referred
to
you
also
is
an
accumulated
earnings
tax
case
had
arises
under
section
531,
537
internal
revenue
code.
if
the
court
would
permit,
i
might
in
one
very
brief
moment
spelled
out
the
particular
provision
of
533
which
is
of
issue
in
this
case.
the
very
section
533
portion
which
is
particularly
pertinent
to
the
consideration
says
this,
"the
fact
that
the
earnings
and
profits
of
a
corporation
are
permitted
to
accumulate
beyond
the
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
shall
be
determinative
of
the
purpose
to
avoid
the
income
tax
with
respect
to
shareholders."
i
might
state
briefly
that
ivan
allen
company
is
involved
in
this
case
by
reason
of
the
purchase
of
xerox
stock
in
19
--
for
the
years
1965-1966.
the
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
ivan
allen
company
accumulated
earnings
beyond
a
reasonable
needs
of
the
business
that
we
--
to
their
earnings
and
profits
succeed
are
reasonable
business
needs
for
those
years.
the
issue
has
been
framed
by
stipulation
to
present
a
relatively
simple
issue
insofar
as
the
business
figures
of
the
corporation
are
concerned.
the
amount
of
xerox
stock,
which
we
claim
and
did
so
claim
successfully
in
the
district
court,
which
was
purchased
from
earnings,
the
accumulated
earnings
was
$154,000.00.
that
is
the
amount
of
investment
which
we
have
in
liquid
assets.
that
amount
was
reflected
in
the
year
1965
as
$154,000.00
and
the
year
1966
a
taxable
year
in
june
of
30th
that
was
reflected
as
$135,000.00
because
some
of
that
xerox
stocks
have
been
sold
in
the
year
1965.
the
question
here
before
this
court
and
it's
whether
or
not
the
earnings
and
profits
in
determining
this
question
whether
the
earnings
and
profits
exceed
the
reasonable
business
needs
of
the
business
are
reasonable
needs
to
be
compared
with
the
earnings
and
profits
reflected
in
the
liquid
asset
as
we
contend
at
cost
or
as
the
government
says,
as
total
resources
available
including
unrealized
appreciation
as
the
government
contends.
the
xerox
stock
web
from
a
basic
cost
of
$154,000.00
in
the
year
for
the
taxable
year
of
1965
to
$1,640,000.00
rough
years,
and
the
year
of
1966
as
the
records
will
show
that
same
stock
at
that
time
$135,000.00
had
a
liquidation
of
market
value
less
cost
of
your
--
well,
market
value
of
that
time
of
$2,500,000.00.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
alright,
sir.
the
reason
was,
they
were,
i
don't
know
if
it's
in
the
record,
they
were
in
the
3m,
they
had
the
franchise
for
3m
machine,
this
old
machine
which
minnesota
mined.
they
lost
that
franchise,
they
saw
that
xerox
on
the
market.
they
are
aware
and
they
saw
that
mr.
allen
back
in
the
60's.
he
had
some
cash
money,
your
honor,
and
this
is
accumulated
earnings
which
a
record
will
show
was
needed
in
operating
capital
stipulated
that
this
cash,
we
agree
as
an
operating
capital.
he
invested
this
in
a
security
rather
leave
in
oddly
in
the
cash
or
just
in
the
savings
account.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
no,
no,
i'm
saying
he
was
part
of
the
company
as
mr.
ivan
allen
i
say
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
it's
a
corporation.
he
was
the
president
of
the
company
at
this
time.
but
it
was
a
corporation
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
case
would
not
be
here
today
if
ivan
allen
company
had
just
wanted
to
be
safe
and
just
leave
the
$154,000.00
in
cash
because
it
is
stipulated
by
the
government
that
--
we
so
state
that
the
cost
to
our
investment
as
it
is
invested
--
cost
of
our
earnings
that
which
is
the
investment
of
xerox
and
liquid
assets
is
available
to
meet
reasonable
business
needs.
we
say
that
the
appreciation
is
not
available
that
these
are
not
earnings
and
that
the
amount
earning
so
we
paid
tax
of
$154,000.00
which
went
into
--
which
are
accumulated
earnings
had
we
left
and
i
don't
think
the
government
will
contend
otherwise,
had
we
left
that
$154,000.00
just
in
cash
have
management
which
was
hesitant
to
make
decisions,
hesitant
to
looked
around
and
see
what
was
a
good
investment
for
some
temporary
money
while
they
are
waiting
to
use
as
his
operating
capital,
and
this
was
and
stipulated
as
to
cost
it
was
operating
capital.
have
they
left
that
$154,000.00
in
cash
as
operating
capital,
there
would
be
no
claim
because
it
is
stipulated
in
this
case
that
the
amount
of
all
reasonable
business
needs
as
an
operated
in
capital
$1,000,002.00
in
1965
and
$1,000,004
in
1966
would
equaled
exactly
the
accumulated
earnings
for
the
years
--
the
same
years
of
1965
and
1966
if
the
stock
is
treated
as
we
respectfully
submit
in
earnings
that
the
investment
that
they
had
in
liquid
assets
that
would
be
$1,000,002.00
which
will
be
the
accumulated
earnings,
and
$1,000,004.00.
so
you
see,
we
are
saying
that
$154,000.00
and
respectfully
$135,000.00
of
those
two
years.
in
cash,
that
was
all
the
earnings
we
had.
we
put
it
into
the
liquid
assets,
it
was
proper
operate
in
capital
and
available
to
meet
the
business
needs.
now,
here's
the
case
and
here's
what
the
government
says
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
correct.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
the
government
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
june
of
30th
of
65'
and
june
of
30th
of
66'.
now,
the
government
contends
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
state
by
attorney
at
page
70
and
page
90
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
excuse
me.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
i'm
not
certain
it
does,
it
only
shows
the
--
what
the
government
refers
to
as
the
net
liquidation
value.
they
show
the
market
and
in
the
record
shows
the
cost
of
conversion
which
will
cost
that
showing
does
not
show
the
variation.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
the
cost
of
conversion
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
oh,
no
that's
the
cost.
they
have
stipulated
that
there
would
be
approximately
--
i
believe
37.5%
if
we
did
sell
the
stock.
that
would
be
all
our
capital
gain
stock,
the
6%
other
tax
and
then
the
--
some
dispute
about
the
georgia
tax
but
we
claim
that
there
is
three
taxes
which
would
apply
if
we
were
forced
to
convert
and
therefore,
we
would
not
have
the
full
value
even
under
their
theory
available
to
meet
business
needs.
i
think
that
is
in
the
record
your
honor
and
stipulated.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
had
we
converted
it?
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
but
what
we
have
done
we
would
naturally
we
would
have
paid
the
capital
of
the
intersection,
your
honor
at
that
time.
we
would
then
have
as
we
did
when
we
saw
the
thousand
shares
of
xerox
in
1966,
we
would
put
it
into
our
business
for
operation.
we
would
earn
money.
we
would
pay
for
the
income
tax
on
that
as
we
did
in
1966.
you'll
notice
our
earnings
went
up
from
$341,000.00
to
$629,000.00
and
we
would
have
then
--
yes,
we
would
have
used
it
and
put
it
in
but
the
question
your
honor
may
be
this,
does
that
statute
531
to
37
and
the
legislative
history
require
a
conversion
of
what
the
government
is
claiming
and
what's
he
did
successfully
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
prevailing
upon
the
first
circuit
to
reverse
judge
moye
with
--
judge
moye
the
district
judge
established
a
principles
which
we
urging
in
this
court.
what
they
would
do
then
is
force
a
conversion
or
if
they
certain
the
last
day
of
our
taxable
year.
it
would
be
without
reference
at
all
as
to
whether
or
not
business
judgment
the
term,
and
the
time,
and
the
place,
and
the
best
conditions
under
which
investment
should
be
sold
and
whether
or
not
it
would
be
wise
to
sell
it
all
over
at
that
time.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
but
the
government
says
well,
we
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
so
much
i
would
asked
would
be
necessary
to
pay
the
amount
of
the
dividends
or
let's
say
claim
we
say
we
should
pay
all
of
our
profit
earnings
and
profits
in
the
taxable
years.
now,
your
honor
what
they
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
oh,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
that
would
be
reflected
in
property
very
frequently,
yes
sir.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
but
the
point
is
the
statute
makes
a
comparison.
we
would
submit
that
the
statute
makes
a
comparison
as
to
earnings
with
the
reasonable
business
needs
for
the
taxable
year.
now,
what
they
say
is
that
they
are
not
tax
--
that's
what
they
have
taxing
of
that
amount
exceeds
when
you
put
market
on
it
that
that's
what
they're
taxing.
but
what
they
do,
your
honor,
they
go
to
liquid
assets
and
they
claim
that
all
amounts
which
we
are
holding
as
investment
in
liquid
assets
under
the
smoot
case
which
we
hold
at
cost,
that
is
our
cost
a
$154,000.00.
they
take
this
and
they
put
the
appreciated
value
on
it,
and
then
they
say,
"you
look
at
total
sources
of
funds
in
making
the
comparison."
now,
there
is
no
statute,
no
regulation
under
535
or
531
in
anyway
that
ever
adopts
except
in
this
case
and
in
the
fifth
circuit.
they
did
this
and
they
call
it
in
the
tax
court
which
we
say
is
wrong.
we
ask
this
court
to
disregard
that
decision
but
what
they
do
is
that
they
take
that
figure
which
is
in
total
--
which
is
in
the
liquid
assets
and
they
have
interpreted
that
they
say
that
all
of
your
liquid
assets,
all
the
current
liquid
assets,
that
when
you
compare
that
with
your
business
needs
at
a
converted
figure
which
would
be
the
hundred
to
million
sects
that
if
that
exceeds
your
reasonable
business
needs
then
you
have
accumulated
earnings
which
you
must
pay
tax
on
a
county
tax.
now,
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
right.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
no,
sir.
they
say
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
right.
they
say
we
should
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
correct.
what
they
did
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
they
have
met
that
that
is
not
earnings
but
your
honor
the
way
they
go
about
it
is
this.
they
have
applied
a
different
rule.
they
have
--
they
are
forcing
a
conversion
on
your
asset,
your
liquid
--
the
so
much
to
your
liquid
assets
are
at
cost.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
well,
but
your
honor
the
measure
there
the
comparison
is
under
section
533
of
the
code
and
the
comparison
the
words
are
"earnings
and
profits"
as
you
measure,
you
compare
your
earnings
and
profits
for
that
year
the
accumulate
earnings
and
profits
--
your
accumulate
earnings
and
profits
as
against
your
reasonable
business
needs.
now,
if
you
look
at
cost,
our
reasonable
business
needs
over
$1,000,002.00
in
65'
are
accumulated
earnings
of
$1,000,002.00.
they
agree
then
that's
exactly
the
same.
now,
what
they're
saying
that
you
take
total
resources,
you
take
your
liquid
assets
and
when
you
take
liquid
asset
you
appreciate
the
stock
which
has
a
cost
value
reflected
in
liquid
assets.
now,
we'll
come
to
that
word,
that
is
a
very
critical
word
because
if
misstated
the
rule
we
submit
in
the
smoot
case.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
the
word
"reflected"
the
smoot
case
in
1960
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
but
this
case
would
be
establish
in
the
rule
though,
in
this
particular
instances
it
is
liquid.
we
would
loss
value
in
the
courts
we
have
come
at
par.
we
would
loss
value
of
approximately
from
30%
to
37%
or
maybe
by
reason
of
conversion.
we
will
be
forced
to
sell
it
is
liquid
but
this
would
apply
to
closely
held
corporations
in
which
one
of
the
concerns
would
be
evaluation,
it
would
a
closely
held
corporations
stock
be
able
to
have
an
available
ready
sale.
now,
you
see
the
ninth
circuit
in
golconda,
they
held
that
eventhough
there's
tax
court,
they
held
it
was
an
applicable
because
it
was
a
publicly
held
corporation.
so,
the
imposition
that
would
be
establish
in
this
case
under
fifth
circuit
has
established
says
that,"
at
the
end
of
every
taxable
year
that
all
your
total,
not
your
earnings
and
profits
as
the
statute
says,
all
your
total
resources
must
be
look
to,
to
see
whether
or
not
you
can
meet
your
reasonable
business
needs."
now,
that
means
on
december
the
31st
you
have
effect
that
they
have
been
told
that
that
market
value
whatever
the
stock
is
at
that
time
stock
market
value
at
that
time
establishes
that
you
have
been
told,
you
have
that
you
will
be
in
place
of
market
value
on
it.
now,
let's
assume
your
honor
and
we
say
and
you
set
it
in
this
court
in
eisner
in
1938,
you
have
very
--
you
expressed
concern
about
force
conversion,
the
american
trading
company
fourth
circuit
did
the
same
thing
in
1973.
what
you
would
do
in
december
the
31st,
you
force
--
you
make
him
determine
a
market
value
on
that
stock.
the
question
is
and
this
is
where
the
error
is,
there
is
no
insurance
that
that
will
continued
to
be
available
into
the
next
year
even
under
january
of
2nd,
suppose
in
antitrust
suits
or
some
fraud
suits
were
filed.
you
say
that
where
stock
is
worth
a
billion
and
a
half
dollars
or
in
antitrust
suit
was
filed
against
xerox
corporation
on
january
1st.
you
have
established
that
not
by
business
judgment
but
by
the
determination
of
the
government.
the
government
has
come
in
and
told
you
when
your
sale
is
and
on
january
the
2nd,
the
question
is
continue
the
availability
to
meet
prior
operating
in
business
needs.
now,
on
january
the
2nd,
something
completely
happens
as
to
judge
moye
says
secretary
of
state's
petitions
it
goes
to
europe.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
but
only,
your
honor,
only
to
the
extent
of
a
hundred
--
yes,
operating
needs
$154,000.00.
now,
we
stipulate
as
part
of
our
operating
capital.
we
would
have
to
sell
$154,000.00
worth
to
take
care
of
it
but
we
would
have
to
sell
all
of
it.
now,
what
the
government
--
we
would
have
to
sell
the
whole
thing
we
just
have
to
sell
that
$154,000.00
of
our
amount.
what
or
maybe,
it
maybe
more
but
what
the
government
is
saying
is
when
you
measure
it
we
had
to
--
they
have
said
we
have
to
pay
out
the
whole
$600,000.00
of
profits
for
the
taxable
years
that
we
had
dividend
then
we
should
pay
all
of
that
out.
now,
we
did
pay
out
a
dividend
and
we
have
been
paying
our
dividends
but
they
said
all
of
it
should
be
because
when
you
take
your
appreciated
value,
they
say
they're
not
tax,
and
they
have
met
they
say
appreciation
is
not
an
income.
but
what
they
have
done
is
they
have
converted
earnings
in
some
form
or
another
to
look
equity,
they
used
another
equity
test
and
which
they
say
that
you
reach
up
in
any
total
resources.
now
the
question
i
want
to
make,
the
smoot
test,
they
say
smoot.
smoot
was
a
case
in
which
was
referred
to
is
a
pre-smoot
days
and
post-smoot
days,
before,
it
was
the
size
of
the
accumulated
earnings;
they
look
the
accumulated
earnings
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
had
accumulated
in
excess
your
reasonable
the
business
needs.
in
1960,
in
the
smoot
case,
what
they
have
did
they
separated,
they
said
there
are
certain
things
while
they
are
earnings.
there
is
no
way
you
can
use
those
for
to
me
reasonable
to
business
needs.
they
are
in
your
plant
in
your
equipment.
so,
they
took
that
out.
they
said,
"to
the
extent
your
earnings
to
that
you
can
accumulate
with
impunity."
then
they
came
and
said,
"now,
what
we
should
do
for
a
practicality
of
this?"
and
this
as
they
establish
a
liquid
assets
and
said
that
so
much
of
surplus
as
it
is
reflected
in
the
liquid
assets
so
much
of
the
earnings
--
earnings
separate
--
you
separate
the
same
thing.
so
much
as
it
is
reflected
in
liquid
assets
are
to
be
measured
against
the
reasonable
needs
and
if
you
exceed
that
then
you
have
violated
the
statute.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
no,
we
would
pay
to
dividends
your
honor.
that
what
--
if
we
have
liquid
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
no,
sir.
we
have
agreed
that
the
stock
of
our
earnings
are
invested
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
is
$154,000.00.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
it's
probably
reasonable
business
needs.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
we
did
do
that
in
1966.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that
would
be
part
of
our
liquid
assets
and
to
meet
reasonable
business
needs.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that
would
go
into
our
earnings.
we
did
do
just
sell.
we
sold
a
thousand
shares
and
then
put
it
in
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
correct.
no
question
about
it
but
we
elected
and
did
to
the
converting.
it
was
a
business
judgment
as
to
when
it
was
desirable.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
alright,
sir.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
absolutely,
that
would
then
be
income
and
we
would
be
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
but
then,
we
would
make
the
pay
the
dividends
is
the
question
here
your
honor
is,
when
is
it
wise
to
do
that?
i
know
we're
not
trying
to
mean
anyway
technical.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
unrealized
income
as
unrealized
appreciation.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
correct.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
correct,
your
honor
and
while
it
maybe
that
we
are
following
we
say
has
good
reason.
they
stat
--
the
legislative
history
of
this
particular
act
since
1954
has
been
to
favor
of
taxpayer,
the
language
of
words
earnings
were
deliberate.
they
are
to
determine
the
source
and
which
the
funds
to
be
pay
the
legislative
history
shows
that
every
amendment
has
been
favor
in
the
small
businessmen,
just
this
year
the
exemption
is
going
from
$60,000.00
to
1975
or
$175,000.00.
the
question
of
reasonable
business
needs,
you
used
to
have
to
have
a
specific
plan.
it
was
amended
at
section
537
to
say
reasonably
forcible
needs
and
here,
we
come
right
that
now
to
include
these
new
ideas
which
the
government
is
injecting
and
there
is
no
word
of
liquidity,
there
is
no
--
the
statute
then
used
liquidity
test.
the
liquid
assets
test
which
they
have
misconstrued
in
this
brief,
we're
saying
to
the
fifth
circuit.
likewise,
puts
your
evaluation
on
a
basis
of
measuring
of
earnings
and
while
the
legislature
has
--
the
congress
has
written
in
this
way
in
bronstein
case
in
1963.
you
recognized
that
while
it
was
a
matter
of
taxation
and
that
that's
the
way
the
legislation
was
written
and
it
was
a
matter
--
if
that's
the
way
congress
did
it
and
it
didn't
appear
to
be
a
type
of
situation
for
the
judicial
determination.
we
would
submit,
your
honor
that
the
question
of
a
legislative
interpretation
is
very
deliberate
here,
it's
very
much
designed
because
they
even
recognize
that
they
were
concern
about
the
government
harassing,
it's
in
our
brief,
harassing
small
businessmen
and
they
have
now
took
the
penalty
tax
off,
and
another
thing
we
must
recognize
that
this
is
a
penalty
judge.
we
pay
the
income
tax
and
the
rule
of
goal
versus
golez,
in
the
case
of
penalty
taxes
that
you
must
construe
any
enlargement
of
misconstruction
or
interpretation
question
as
against
the
government
and
for
the
taxpayer.
we
say
there
is
no
ambiguity.
the
term
in
1936
the
word
"gain"
was
change
to
"earnings",
so,
of
the
earnings
and
profit
and
every
measure,
every
deliberate
concern
of
the
legis
--
of
congress
has
been
on
earnings
and
yet,
they
bring
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
they
contend
that
it
is
not,
your
honor.
but
what
they
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
they
reach
out
for
a
new
term
called
"total
resources
available."
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
not
what
the
statute
says,
the
statute
says,
"earnings
and
profits
available."
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
but
they
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
that's
very
interest
and
i'm
glad
you
mentioned
it
because
one
of
the
indications
that
cause
a
proper
value
is
in
regulations
to
562
when
you
give
your
unrelated
stock
out
they
give
you
a
credit
only
at
cost.
they
don't
give
bucket.
yes,
what
they
trying
to
do
is
trigger
us
at
market
example
in
when
we
give
--
when
we
transfer
870
shares
of
xerox
to
our
shareholders
in
1965,
it
had
a
market
value
approximately
$87,000.00.
if
you
notice
on
your
balance
sheet
that
in
that
year,
we
were
going
to
credit
for
$6,500.00,
section
312
of
the
internal
revenue
code
talked
about
earnings
says
that
there
must
be
that
when
there's
a
recognition
at
the
time
that
that
is
when
the
gain
and
that's
when
earnings
become
indicative.
it
is
nothing
in
the
statute
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
he
has
to
pay,
when
the
shareholder
gets
it,
they
give
the
corporation
only
cost
deduction
but
when
he
gets
it
he
must
pay
market
value.he
pays
tax
on
a
basis
of
market
value.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
it
is
a
new
market.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
and
as
american
trading
you
asked
by
the
dividend
american
trading
--
the
government
made
the
same
contention
there.
they
said
what
that
would
do
is
dissipate
the
entire
thing
that
they
would
have
--
first,
you
loss
37.5%.
the
government
determines
when
you
sell
your
stock
and
on
that
very
day,
you
loss
up
to
37.5%
in
your
value
which
is
not
available
to
meet,
then
you
get
a
cost
deduction
and
if
it's
treating
you
at
market
and
then
your
stockholder
has
to
pay
the
full
value
when
he
gets
it.
now,
as
the
court
said
in
the
couch
nebraska
1964,
i
hate
to
say
that
to
the
court
but
it's
on
point
and
i
think
it's
very
significant.
they
say,
"they
hope
that
they
don't
see
day
the
courts
said."
when
government
invades
business
to
such
of
extent,
in
this
very
issue,
that
they
can
determine
when
stocks
are
sold
and
therefore,
they
held
in
that
case
that
force
conversion
was
not
desirable
that
whether
was
doing
is
put
in
government
in
the
back
--
into
the
management
seat
and
all
decisions
are
manageable
will
be
trigger
thereafter.
we
submit
as
you
have
also
said
in
eisner
that
this
was
not
the
effect
design
and
other
issues
i
know
i
could
treat
but
--
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
we
won't
take
it
your
honor.
mr.
kirk
m.
mcalpin
yes,
sir.
we
do.
