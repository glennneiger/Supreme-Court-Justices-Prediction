e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
74-22,
ivan
allen
company
against
the
united
states.
mr.
mcalpin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
mcalpin.
mr.
crampton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
crampton,
what
if
this
taxpayer
had
purchased
xerox
that
the
highest
points,
whatever
that
was,
and
that
you
were
dealing
with
it
in
terms
of
today's
market
value,
so
that
there
would
be
an
enormous
unrealized
loss.
how
would
that
figure
in
the
process
of
taking
in
to
consideration
and
language
of
the
regulation
taking
into
consideration
of
the
total
picture?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we'll
resume
there
mr.
crampton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
the
arguments
in
ivan
allen
company
against
the
united
states.
mr.
crampton,
you
have
18
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
included
in
the
first
part
of
your
statement
would
be
land
for
example
which
is
purchased
for
possible
plant
expansion
if
they
could
demonstrate
a
valid
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
was
land
they
bought
for
speculation
for
arise
in
the
market
then
would
it
fall
in
the
same
category
in
your
view
is
the
xerox
stock?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
turns
on
liquidity
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
really
limiting
test
isn't
it
when
you
consider
that
in
certain
periods
land
--
investment
land
could
be
a
shelter
that
would
be
quite
as
liquid
as
xerox
stock
with
very
high
return
certain
areas
of
the
country
capital
gains.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
if
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
would
interrupt
you
again.
are
you
really
saying
that
the
liquidity
test
is
something
like
making
the
comparison
of
whether
the
asset
is
in
about
the
same
shape
as
it
would
be
if
it
were
sitting
in
the
bank?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
bank,
it
would
clearly
be
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
subject
to
this
penalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you're
saying
that
any
asset
which
has
essentially
the
same
kind
of
liquidity
as
money
in
the
bank,
it
is
then
subject
to
penalty
provision?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
can
use
pay
out
dividends
in
time
to
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
they
paid
out
a
million
dollars
of
xerox
stock
to
the
stockholders
as
dividends
to
the
stockholders
of
their
own
company
they
say
fairly
substantial
amount
in
commissions,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
crampton.
mr.
mcalpin,
you
have
three
minutes
left.
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
submit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
