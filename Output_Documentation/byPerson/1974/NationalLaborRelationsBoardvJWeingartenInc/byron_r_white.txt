mr.
hardin,
that
board
isn't
taking
that
position
but
if
this
all
turns
around
the
word
“concerted”,
and
it's
concerted
because
one
employee
is
holding
on
his
hand
to
the
other,
i
don't
know
were
your
limits
are
when
he
doesn't
fear
discipline
is
pure
investigation
or
is
just
a
conversation.
and
he
holds
out
his
hand
to
the
other
they
want
somebody
along
with
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
won't
happen
as
long
as
the
board
sets
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
what
the
board
rule
is
under
the
proviso
if
there
is
a
grievance
in
the
employee
who
wants
to
adjust
it
by
himself
with
the
employer?
may
he
bring
--
is
he
entitled
to
have
somebody
else
come
with
him
even
though
it
isn't
the
union?
