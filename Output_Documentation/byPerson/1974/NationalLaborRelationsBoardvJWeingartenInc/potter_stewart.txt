justice

it
has
to
be
--
you
have
to
say
this,
this
involves
engaging
in
concerted
activities.
justice
potter
stewart
not
just
act
in
concert,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
says
to
engage
in
other
concerted
activities.
now,
that's
a
little
different
arguably.
in
other
words,
if
you're
going
to
rely
on
the
statutory
language,
i
think
it's
quite
important
that
we
keep
our
eye
on
what
the
statutory
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
the
previous
store,
there
clearly
had
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
store
no.
2
or
whatever.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
lobby
type
store.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so,
what
was
the
board's
order,
there
was
no
reinstatement,
and
that's
the
order
necessarily.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
--
these,
the
facts
because
of
what
you
just
told
us,
well
less
little
more
mild
in
this
case
than
in
the
previous
one.
but
is
the
issue,
the
identical
issue,
is
there
any
difference
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
so
we
have
there,
the
representatives
--
justice
potter
stewart
but,
it's
basically
the
same
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
precisely
the
same,
that
is
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
the
precise
language
having
to
do
with
representation
appears
in
another
part
of
the
act,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
right
to
have
union
representation
or
union
representative
at
the
time
of
a
grievance.
that
appears
somewhere
else
in
the
act
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
proviso
to
9
(a)?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
view
of
that
very
precise
language
at
the
time
that
the
congress
was
focusing
on
this
problem,
don't
you
suppose
that
that
could
be
argued
as
the
metes
and
bounds
of
what
congress
intended
to
give
by
way
of
representation?
justice
potter
stewart
the
language
of
history
certainly
shows,
i
would
--
either
as
i
remember
it
and
i
don't
remember
it
specifically
with
respect
to
this
problem
that
6
and
7
had
to
do
is
the
right
to
get
together
in
a
group
and
to
organize,
first
to
collectively
bargaining
and
secondly,
for
various
other
purposes,
but
not
involving,
not
that
all
involving,
and
that
suggesting
that
this
involved
individual
representation
at
the
time
of
an
interview
between
an
employee
and
his
employer.
and
since
so
for
as
that's
covered
or
dealt
with
or
focused
upon
by
the
congress,
you'll
find
that
in
the
proviso
to
9
(b),
won't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
9
(a),
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hardin,
you're
not
contending
or
are
you
that
this
comes
out
of
the
collective
bargaining
part
of
section
7?
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
was
a
goody
of
such
talk
in
the
briefs,
i
remember
as
i
read
on
it.
maybe
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
could
--
so
this
is
not
collective
bargaining?
justice
potter
stewart
even
a
grievance
â€“
even
a
complain
that
that
of
kind
of
grievance
is
not
generally
known
as
collective
bargaining
isn't
it,
it's
something
else.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
we
don't
need
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
so-called
minor
dispute.
but
this
is
not
collective
bargaining,
you're
not
contending
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
through
representatives
doesn't
have
any
and
that
language
is
inapplicable
here?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
previous
case,
we
had
what
seemed
to
be
insubordination
case,
sassing
mrs.
gerlach
or
whatever
the
name
was,
and
the
board
came
out
the
same
way
saying
that
that
created
a
reasonable
fear
on
behalf
of
the
employee
to
extent
that
she
was
entitled
to
have
a
union
representative
present
if
she
wanted
to.
justice
potter
stewart
o
that
board
as
i
understand
in
these
two
cases
has
made
the
distinction
that
you've
just
suggested.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
mr.
martin
accept
the
law
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
at
a
concededly
disciplinary
interview,
an
employee
has
a
right
to
a
fellow
employee
or
a
labor
representative?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
you're
complaining
about
the
dichotomy
that
i
had
a
--
which
would
suggest
that
you
might
be
accepting
the
validity
of
it
on
the
disciplinary.
justice
potter
stewart
now
we're
dealing
here
where
the
question
is
what
does
the
statute
require?
justice
potter
stewart
either
kind
or
area.
justice
potter
stewart
or
if
anything
until
and
unless
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
disciplinary
action
and
there's
a
grievance.
justice
potter
stewart
but
again,
you're
confusing
me.
if
you're
--
i
don't
know
if
you're
taking
the
dichotomy
or
if
you're
saying
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
no
representation
the
statutory
require
it
at
all
in
any
interview.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
any
dichotomy?
