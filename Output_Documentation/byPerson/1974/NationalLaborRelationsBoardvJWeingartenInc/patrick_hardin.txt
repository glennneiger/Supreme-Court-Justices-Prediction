mr.
patrick
hardin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
like
the
one
just
argued
presents
the
court
with
the
issue
whether
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
refuse
an
employee's
request
for
the
presence
of
her
union
representative
at
an
investigatory
interview
which
the
employee
reasonably
believes
will
lead
to
disciplinary
action.
and
i'd
like
to
begin
by
pointing
out
to
that
there
are
no
cross-petitions
in
this
case,
and
that
to
the
propriety
of
the
fifth
--
of
the
labor
and
the
fifth
circuit
determination
that
the
right
to
union
representation,
as
a
part
of
the
right
to
bargain
collectively
arises
at
the
point
where
discipline
is
to
be
imposed
is
an
issue
not
directly
presented
in
this
case.
we
are
here
concerned
with
a
different
part
of
the
statutory
rights
conferred
by
section
7.
specifically,
they
are
the
rights
to
act
in
concert
from
mutual
aid
or
protection.
the
board
is
held
that
that
grant
of
statutory
right,
which
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
right
to
act
in
concert
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining,
does
grant
to
the
employee
the
right
to
be
represented
at
an
investigatory
interview.
i'm
going
to
state
the
facts
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
yes,
that
must
be
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
concerted
activities
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
you're
quite
right.
it
must
be
concerted
activity,
and
the
labor
board
of
course
has
found
that
one
employee
stretches
a
hand
to
the
other
to
seek
that
mutual
aid,
they
are
engaged
in
concerted
activity
or
are
seeking
to
do
so
a
right
which
the
board
can
protect.
i
think
that
a
statement
of
the
facts
will
help
to
illustrate
for
the
court
very
clearly
the
value
to
the
employee
of
the
right
which
the
board
has
recognized
in
this
case
as
it
did
in
quality.
j.
weingarten
company
operates
a
chain
of
about
100
retail
stores
in
the
houston,
texas
area.
like
most
large
retail
and
distribution
enterprises,
it
maintains
a
centralized
security
apparatus,
one
of
the
purposes
of
which
is
to
investigate
suspected
employee
theft.
leura
collins
is
an
employee
of
j.
weingarten
and
has
been
employed
since
1961
in
a
number
of
stores
working
at
lunch
counters
or
in
the
lobby
departments,
a
more
sophisticated
prepared
food
takeout
arrangement.
in
june
of
1972,
mrs.
collins
was
working
at
store
number
98,
and
in
june
of
1972,
information
came
to
the
company's
attention
which
suggested
that
mrs.
collins
was
engaged
in
dishonest
activities.
the
record
does
not
disclose
either
the
source
of
the
nature
of
that
information.
the
company
reacted
to
it
by
dispatching
one
of
its
loss
prevention
specialists,
mr.
hardy
to
conduct
an
investigation.
and
on
june
15,
1972,
mr.
hardy
began
two
days
of
plain
close
surveillance
of
the
operation
of
the
lobby
department
at
store
no.
98.
he
saw
nothing
which
indicated
any
evidence
of
wrongdoing
by
the
employees.
and
on
the
third
morning,
which
would
have
been
the
18th,
he
introduced
himself
to
the
store
manager
at
store
no.
98,
mr.
york.
the
two
have
not
previously
known
one
another,
and
the
loss
prevention
specialists
identified
himself
as
a
member
of
the
central
security
bureau
of
the
employer's
operation.
he
reported
that
he
had
conducted
an
investigation
into
the
lobby
department,
and
had
found
no
evidence
of
any
employee
dishonesty.
the
manager
responded
by
saying
“why
just
this
very
morning,
another
employee
in
the
lobby
department
reported
to
me
that
yesterday,
mrs.
collins
took
a
$3.00
box
of
fried
chicken
from
the
lobby
department,
and
put
only
a
dollar
in
the
till.”
well,
the
loss
prevention
specialists
decided
to
check
that
out.
he
summoned
the
employee
who
had
so
reported
to
the
manager,
mrs.
moody,
and
he
interrogated
her
about
the
allegation
of
--
that
mrs.
collins
had
stolen
$2.00
worth
of
chicken
the
day
before.
mrs.
moody
confirmed
the
story,
and
then,
mrs.
collins
was
summoned
to
an
area
near
the
manager's
office.
there,
she
was
confronted
with
the
loss
prevention
specialists
from
headquarters,
who
began
to
interrogate
her
about
the
general
acts
of
dishonesty.
mrs.
collins
asked
if
she
could
have
the
assistance
or
the
presence
of
her
union
representative.
the
store
manager
said
“no.
this
is
a
private
matter
between
you
and
the
company.”
with
respect
to
the
questioning
about
the
box
of
chicken
on
the
preceding
day,
mrs.
collins
stated
“we
had
been
out
of
small
boxes,
so
i
took
a
small
$1.00
quantity
of
chicken,
put
it
in
a
larger
box,
paid
the
dollar
for
it
and
left
the
store.”
the
loss
prevention
specialists
went
to
check
this
out
and
he
determined
that
in
fact,
the
store
had
been
out
of
smaller
boxes
on
the
preceding
day,
and
that
the
employee
who
had
reported
on
mrs.
collins
didn't
know
how
much
chicken
she'd
put
in
the
large
box.
he
went
back
to
the
interview
and
said
“the
interview
is
terminated.
your
story
checks
out.”
at
that
point,
mrs.
collins
became
very
emotional
and
began
to
cry,
probably
tears
of
relief.
but
in
any
rate
in
her
relief,
she
says
“i've
worked
for
weingarten's
for
11
years
and
i've
never
taken
anything
that
i've
paid
for,
except
the
free
lunches.”
the
loss
prevention
specialists
and
the
manager
professed
to
be
astonished
that
anyone
was
getting
free
lunches
at
weingarten's,
and
they
immediately
resumed
the
interrogation.
[crowd
laughing]
mr.
patrick
hardin
that's
the
company's
terminology,
your
honor.
the
--
mrs.
collins
again
asked
for
the
assistance
of
her
union
representative.
she
insisted
that
she
had
taken
lunches
because
it
was
the
practice
of
all
the
employees,
including
the
lobby
department
manager
to
do
so,
and
she
indicated
that
she
would
not
sign
a
statement
which
the
loss
prevention
specialists
was
then
typing
by
which
she
was
to
acknowledge
a
debt
to
the
company
of
$160.00
for
lunches
which
she
shouldn't
have
eaten.
the
loss
prevention
specialists
then
made
some
further
inquiries
and
discovered
that
no
one
at
company
headquarters
could
say
for
sure
that
there
was
or
was
not
a
policy
permitting
free
lunches
at
store
98.
mr.
patrick
hardin
they
clearly
had
been
at
the
lunch
counter
at
the
previous
store
where
she
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
that's
right,
store
no.
2.
when
she
had
transferred
the
store
no.
98,
the
company
apparently
thought
that
she
and
all
employees
had
been
instructed
that
there
would
be
no
free
lunch,
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
that's
right.
the
record
does
not
disclose
affirmatively
that
such
instructions
every
were
given,
and
it
does
show
that
all
of
the
employees
in
the
lobby
department,
including
an
employee
titled
lobby
department
manager
were
taking
free
lunch
everyday
that
he
worked.
the
interview
was
terminated.
later
in
the
afternoon,
the
manager
discovered
that
in
fact
all
the
employees
in
the
lobby
were
getting
free
lunches,
and
he
the
next
day,
issued
an
order
directing
that
it'd
be
stop.
meanwhile,
he
sent
mrs.
collins
home,
gave
her
the
afternoon
off
because
she
was
so
distraught,
and
asked
that
she
not
discussed
the
interview
with
anyone.
she
discussed
it
with
the
union
representative
and
that
lead
to
the
filing
of
charge
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
general
counsel
issued
a
complaint
against
the
company
alleging
specifically
that
the
company
had
denied
mrs.
collins'
request
for
the
assistance
of
a
union
representative
during
these
interviews,
and
that
the
denial
was
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
mr.
patrick
hardin
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
hardin
she
returned
to
work.
she
was
paid
ultimately
for
the
four
hours
she
taken
off
the
preceding
afternoon,
and
so
far
as
the
record
discloses,
i
think
that
she
is
still
working.
mr.
patrick
hardin
no,
of
course
not,
nor
was
there
in
the
mobil
oil
case
which
had
been
discussed
this
morning.
it's
a
direction
to
the
company
to
cease
and
desist
from
interrogating
employees
unless
there
are
accorded
the
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
the
union
representative.
mr.
patrick
hardin
it
is
identical
in
this
case
to
the
situation
that
the
woman
in
quality
have
been
into
was
asking
for
the
assistance
of
her
union
representatives,
quality
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
--
representatives
themselves
being
disciplined
for
their
efforts
to
provide
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
it
is
basically
the
same
issue.
it
is
precisely
the
same.
mr.
patrick
hardin
the
board
adopted
the
decision
of
its
administrative
law
judge,
which
applied
the
then
recent
quality
manufacturing
decision
and
found
that
there
had
been
concerted
activity
for
the
purpose
of
mutual
aid
and
protection,
and
then
addressed
the
question
whether
mrs.
collins'
fears
that
the
interview
might
lead
to
discipline
were
reasonably
based
in
all
the
circumstances.
the
decision
takes
particular
note
of
the
fact
that
these
events
occurred
in
the
retail
industry,
and
that
weingarten
in
common
most
members
of
that
industry,
most
important
is
in
that
industry,
regard
employee
dishonesty
were
proved
to
the
employer's
satisfaction
to
be
an
unpardonable
offense
the
discipline
for
which
ordinarily
is
discharged,
unless
there
are
exceptional
litigating
circumstances.
with
that
in
mind
and
because
the
contract
here
provided
that
the
usual
system
of
warning
notices
was
not
available
to
an
employee
who
was
deemed
guilty
of
theft
to
the
employer's
satisfaction,
the
law
judge
concluded
that
mrs.
collins'
manifest
fears
had
indeed
been
reasonably
grounded
and
objective
circumstances,
and
that
she
was
entitled
either
to
have
the
assistance
of
her
union
representative
at
that
interview,
or
to
have
the
company
terminate
the
interview
and
forgo
the
benefit
of
what
information
it
might
get
from
interrogating
her.
the
fifth
circuit
refused
to
enforce
the
order
of
the
board.
it
noted
first
in
apparent
conflict
or
inconsistency
between
the
result
in
this
case
and
the
result
which
that
court
had
disapproved
in
the
earlier
texaco
decision
noted
the
apparent
inconsistency
between
the
result
here
and
its
own
earlier
texaco
decision.
but
then,
coming
directly
to
grips
with
the
board's
rational
in
this
case,
that
is
the
proposition
that
the
language
of
section
7
itself
confers
the
right,
the
court
rejected
that
rational
apparently
and
the
opinion
is
not
entirely
clear,
but
apparently,
not
because
it
regarded
its
own
earlier
decisions
as
controlling,
but
because
it
disagreed
with
the
board
about
the
need
to
extend
that
kind
of
protection
to
employees.
the
court
says
and
this
is
from
page
7
(a)
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
the
court
says
while
a
basic
purpose
of
section
7
is
to
allow
employees
to
engage
in
concerted
activities
for
their
mutual
aid
and
protection,
such
a
need
does
not
arise
at
an
investigatory
interview
to
extend
to
the
scope
of
the
act's
protection
to
such
preliminary
contacts
between
an
employee
and
his
employer
would
be
to
apply
an
overbroad
interpretation
of
section
7,
without
explanation
as
to
why
or
direct
explanation
as
to
why
it
regarded
the
protections
as
unneeded
and
the
construction
of
the
statute
which
the
board
had
settled
on
as
being
overbroad.
now,
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
is
defended
in
this
court,
basically
upon
two
grounds.
the
first,
there
is
the
argument
that
the
right
conferred
cannot
be
logically
found
within
the
confines
of
the
statute
itself.
and
secondly,
its
argued
that
the
board's
decision
is
basically
unwise
or
that
the
cost
of
securing
these
employee
rights
will
be
so
far
outweighed
by
the
--
the
advantages
of
securing
these
employee
rights
will
be
so
far
outweighed
by
the
costs
to
the
employers
but
it's
unwise
to
grant
them
in
the
first
instance
of
varying
on
that
last
argument
is
that
the
board
hasn't
really
clearly
told
us
it
made
that
balance,
and
so
you
can
affirm
it
even
if
it's
the
right
balance.
mr.
patrick
hardin
incriminating
literally,
you
mean?
mr.
patrick
hardin
it
certainly
is
possible
that
an
employ
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
yes,
it
is
not
only
possible,
it
is
fairly
common
for
an
employee
caught
in
the
toils
of
the
employer's
security
apparatus,
not
only
to
make
incriminating
statements,
but
to
see
them
written
out
and
then
design
them.
but
the
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
certainly
not,
certainly
not.
the
interest
of
the
employee
and
the
interest
of
the
employer
are
basically
in
harmony
in
such
a
circumstance.
each
has
an
interest
in
seeing
that
the
truth,
whatever
it
is,
is
disclosed,
and
in
preventing
overreaching
by
the
interrogator
which
leads
to
confessions
by
employees
to
events
which
they
may
or
may
not
be
guilty
of,
but
--
which
they
are
not
guilty
in
fact,
i
mean
to
say.
mr.
patrick
hardin
there's
no
contention
whatever
in
this
case
that
the
employer's
actions
are
colored
by
any
state
actions,
notions,
whatever,
and
the
board
in
its
discussion
of
these
issues
has
never
casts
its
discussion
in
constitutional
terms
or
analyzed
the
issues
by
reference
to
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
the
area
of
fifth
amendment
protections.
the
right
which
the
board
is
seeking
to
protect
to
your
springs
from
the
statute
and
has
been
accommodated
as
best
of
the
board
can
accommodate
that
right
to
the
realities
--
industrial
relied.
mr.
patrick
hardin
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
hardin
the
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
well
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
i
think,
we
have
to
separate
two
things
in
this
discussion
your
honor.f
irst
of
all,
the
question
of
how
much
deference
the
board's
view
about
the
meaning
of
the
law
is
entitled
too.
it
is
entitled
to
great
weight,
but
it
is
certainly
not
that
of
standard
of
review
as
not
so
rigorous
as
--
or
so
confine
as
it
would
be
in
the
case
of
an
examination
for
abuse
of
discretion
or
something
of
that
sort.
but
the
second
point
which
has
to
be
remembered
here
is
that
a
part
of
the
process
of
judging
in
these
cases
has
been
the
process
of
adopting
the
perceived
statutory
right,
so
that
it
can
function
in
a
useful
way
in
the
real
world.
and
it's
that
part
of
the
board's
decision
making
function
which
is
entitled
to
very,
very
great
deference
in
reviewing
courts.
and
here,
the
board
clearly
has
in
its
course
of
decision,
taken
a
primary
statutory
right,
a
right
that
i
have
stated
before
is
described
in
the
disjunctive
from
the
right
to
bargain
collectively.
and
it
has
tailored
that
right
in
an
effort
to
permit
employees
to
have
that
mutual
aid
or
protection
at
a
point
where
clearly
is
needed
as
mrs.
collins
situation
attests.
but
it
has
been
limited.
we're
not
here
arguing
as
mr.
jenkins
in
the
last
case
appeared
to
think
but
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
union
representation
at
all
times
under
all
circumstances.
the
right
in
the
board's
view
is
available
first
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
well,
that
--
the
accommodation
of
admittedly
conflicting
interests
in
that
area
is
one
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
--
committed
to
the
board
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
[laughter
attempt]
i
wasn't
going
to
say
that.
i
was
going
to
say,
that
the
entire
matrix
of
law
that
exist
under
the
act
today
is
the
consequence
of
a
serious
of
adjustments
between
conflicting
rights
of
employees
on
the
one
hand
and
needs
of
employers
on
the
other
hand.
mr.
patrick
hardin
--
and
well
within
its
province
to
decide.
mr.
patrick
hardin
in
any
difference
in
the
standard
of
review?
mr.
patrick
hardin
i
think
the
only
useful
distinction
is
that
in
this
morning's
case,
the
board
was
writing
against
a
background
of
considerable
judicial
ruling
by
this
court
in
the
number
of
others.
in
this
afternoon's
cases,
we're
dealing
perhaps
not
with
the
tabula
rasa,
but
with
province
where
the
board
is
still
making
the
first
pronouncements,
and
i
think
that
is
a
factor
which
can
legitimately
affect
scope
of
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
no,
your
honor.
neither
we,
nor
any
other
party
has
been
able
to
take
any
comfort
from
the
legislative
history
in
this
matter.
as
you
know
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
virtually
so.
as
you
know,
the
statutory
language
came
into
the
national
labor
relations
act
via
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
national
industrial
recovery
act,
and
its
precise
language
received
relatively
little
attention
from
the
drafters.
mr.
patrick
hardin
the
precise
language
having
to
do
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
it's
in
the
proviso
to
9
(a).
mr.
patrick
hardin
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
hardin
well
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
well,
of
course,
the
proviso
to
9
(a)
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
--
was
substantially
modified
during
the
1947
amendments.
the
original
version
of
that
if
i'm
correct,
provided
that
the
individual
employee
was
free
to
present
a
grievance
to
his
employer.
the
modifications
in
1947
added
to
that
the
right
to
have
adjusted,
so
that
the
substantial
part
of
the
right
to
deal
individually
with
respect
to
grievances
as
was
added
during
the
1947
modifications
to
the
act.
and
at
that
time,
i
think
it
is
very
pertinent
to
note,
this
issue
had
received
only
the
least
adumbration,
only
one
decision
from
the
board
had
dealt
in
this
area
so
far
as
our
research
discloses,
and
that
was
the
case
where
the
board
expressly
pretermitted
dealing
with
the
question
whether
an
employee
has
an
individual
right
to
representation,
and
of
course
was
the
ross
gear
&
tool
decision.
well,
the
seventh
circuit
somewhat
put
the
development
of
the
law
of
the
track
by
viewing
the
cases
raising
the
issue
which
the
board
had
pretermitted,
but
then
instead
of
remanding
the
case
so
that
the
board
could
answer
that
question,
the
seventh
circuit
decided
it
and
probably
wrongly.
at
the
same
time
that
was
happening,
the
amendments
to
the
act
of
1947
were
putting
the
prosecution
function
in
the
hands
of
the
independent
general
counsel.
and
so
far
as
we
can
tell
from
the
reported
general
counsel's
decisions,
for
the
next
20
years
or
so,
apparently
in
deference
to
this
view
of
the
law
stated
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
ross
gear,
the
general
counsel
refused
the
issue
in
complaints
in
cases
of
this
sort.
so
that
we
only
return
to
this
arena
with
the
issuance
of
the
board's
decision
in
quality
manufacturing
--
in
texaco,
and
that
point,
the
fifth
circuit
because
persuaded
by
the
board's
view
that
at
least
at
the
point
were
discipline
is
to
be
imposed
by
the
employer,
the
employee
has
the
right
under
the
collective
bargaining
part
of
section
7
to
have
the
union
representative
present,
and
the
union
representative
has
the
right
to
be
there.
it
disagreed
with
the
board
however,
that
the
facts
in
that
case
presented
in
occasion
where
discipline
was
to
be
imposed,
and
treated
it
as
instead
as
being
merely
an
occasion
where
the
employer
intended
to
interrogate
the
employee.
mr.
patrick
hardin
no,
we
are
not.
we
are
not.
mr.
patrick
hardin
not
in
our
brief.
mr.
patrick
hardin
no,
this
is
not
collective
bargaining.
you
can't
have
collective
bargaining
until
there
was
something
to
bargain
about,
and
the
board's
view
affirmed
that
to
some
extent
at
least
by
the
fifth
circuit
is
that
something
to
bargain
about
arises
at
the
earliest
where
the
employer
calls
the
employee
and
to
impose
discipline.
this
right
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
i
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
we
don't
have
to
reach
that,
but
the
statutory
language
requires
bargaining
about
the
meaning
of
an
agreement
during
its
term,
as
well
as
about
the
terms
which
are
to
be
settled
on
the
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
we
are
not
contending
that
the
rights
here
arise
out
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
patrick
hardin
that's
correct.
mr.
patrick
hardin
yes.
although,
i
think
that
mr.
dunn
now
has
by
reference
to
the
houston
decision
is
correctly
stated
in
the
law
that
the
--
he
may
have
the
next
friend.
of
course,
the
union
must
be
permitted
to
be
present
and
the
union
also
has
the
statutory
right
to
block,
or
at
least
to
posed
all
the
was
to
the
arbitration
machinery
any
settlement
which
it
regard
his
side
contrary
to
the
terms
of
its
own
collective
bargaining
agreement
now.
thank
you.
mr.
patrick
hardin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
conclude
by
pointing
out
to
the
court
that
the
statutory
language
“concerted
activity”
is
more
than
just
language.
it
defines
rather
broad
concept.
this
court
in
the
jones
&
laughlin
case
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
acknowledged
that
it
granted
fundamental
rights.
and
the
board's
decision
as
to
what
that
statutory
language
means
and
what
content
it
should
be
given
in
the
real
industrial
world,
is
entitled
to
great
weight
and
should
be
accepted
if
the
interpretation
is
reasonable.
and
it's
reasonable
here.
the
board
has
fashioned
a
rule
which
does
not
grant
and
absolute
right,
the
right
to
the
assistance
arises
only
if
there
is
a
reasonable
objective
basis
for
the
fear
that
discipline
is
to
follow.
and
even
in
that
event,
the
employer
is
given
the
option
of
forgoing
the
interview
altogether.
the
board
has
balanced
the
conflicting
interests
and
has
settled
on
a
resolution
which
is
well
within
the
perimeters
of
the
statutory
language.
here
to
return
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist's
question
again,
the
problem
here
for
the
reviewing
court
is
much
the
same
as
it
is
in
the
linden
and
wilder
case
this
morning.
the
congress
has
left
it
to
the
board
to
define
the
reach
of
the
broad
statutory
language
in
the
first
instance.
we
submit
that
in
both
these
cases,
the
board
has
reached
a
reasonable
result,
and
that
defines
the
limits
of
judicial
review
in
both
cases.
mr.
patrick
hardin
there
is
certainly
no
legal
impediment,
whether
the
parties
would
regard
it
as
desirable
in
the
context
of
their
particular
relationship,
but
only
the
parties
to
individual
grievance
can
do
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
there
might
well
be.
mr.
patrick
hardin
but
that
of
course
neglects
the
question
whether
section
7
extends
rights
in
this
arena,
not
only
to
employees
who
are
represented
by
union,
but
also
to
employees
who
are
not.
and
the
statutory
statement
of
the
language
in
the
disjunctive
suggests
congress
intended
to
grant
some
rights
beyond
the
right
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
through
a
representative.
and
the
board
has
given
content
to
those
words
here
by
finding
that
the
right
exists
where
the
employee
reasonably
perceives
that
he
or
she
needs
help
and
seeks
it.
mr.
patrick
hardin
the
--
mr.
patrick
hardin
i
believe
that
follows
from
the
board's
rational
your
honor,
although
the
board
has
not
expressly
spoken
to
that
point.
the
union
might
be
able
to
waive
its
right
to
respond
when
the
employee
ask,
but
the
question
whether
the
union
could
waive
the
right
of
the
employee
to
ask
the
analysis
which
the
board
has
gone
through
would
seem
to
preclude
that
result.
