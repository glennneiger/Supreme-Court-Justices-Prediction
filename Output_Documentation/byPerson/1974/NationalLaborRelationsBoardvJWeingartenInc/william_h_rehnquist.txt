nothing
more
ever
happened
to
mrs.
collins?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
nothing
undesirable
about
that,
though
as
if
the
statements
are
truthful?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hardin,
this
morning,
i
think
you
were
here
when
we
had
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
argued
about
truck
drivers
case,
and
there
of
course
the
court
of
appeals
upset
a
determination
by
the
board
and
the
board
is
here,
mr.
kronenberg,
you
seen
him
have
it
reinstated.
and
you're
here
basically
in
the
same
capacity
from
the
different
decision
this
afternoon.
do
you
see
any
difference
in
the
standard
of
review
of
the
board's
exercise
of
discretion
in
the
case
this
morning
that
should
be
applied
by
this
court
on
the
case
you're
arguing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
that
the
court
should
apply
to
a
determination
by
the
board.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
were
these
judicial
decisions
in
this
area
than
they
were
in
the
area
this
more
in
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
contending
that
the
rule
you
subscribe
to
is
not
only
as
beneficial
to
the
employer,
but
also
to
the
employee?
i
mean
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
is
under
the
rule,
you
contend
for
under
the
statute,
no
finding
could
ever
be
made
in
favor
of
the
employee,
under
the
board's
rule
occasionally
it
will
be.
now,
if
i
were
an
employee,
i'd
rather
have
a
rule
that
would
occasionally
benefit
me
than
one
that
would
never
benefit
me.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
contention
that
the
employer
couldn't
by
agreement
with
the
union
cause
the
right
to
be
waived
on
behalf
of
an
employee,
could
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it's
a
statutory
