mr.
neil
martin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
exploring
upon
what
basis
of
the
labor
board
now
construes
at
section
7
that
creates
an
affirmative
right
for
an
employee.
i
believe
it's
interesting
to
look
at
what
the
board
does
not
cite
as
authority.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
citation
or
articulation
of
the
legislative
history
as
been
stated
before,
the
concentration
the
legislative
history,
both
for
the
wagner
act
and
the
taft-hartley
amendment
was
directed
at
the
inequality
of
employees
before
their
employers
on
the
basis
of
economic
pressure.
it
is
this
thrust
as
senator
wagner
states
say
in
the
legislative
history
that
was
sought
to
be
counterbalanced.
they
were
sought
to
be
an
adjustment
of
an
employees
and
employer's
right
to
deal
economically
one
with
the
other.
admittedly,
section
7
does
not
protect
all
concerted
rights
or
all
concerted
activities.
no
one
would
state
that
illegal
concerted
activities
are
protected
by
a
section
7.
not
every
employer
contact
with
an
employee
was
sought
to
be
protected
by
section
7.
we
submit
that
based
upon
the
overall
view
of
the
legislative
history,
it
is
the
economic
pressure
that
an
employee
was
unable
to
exert
against
his
employer
on
an
individual
basis
that
is
considered,
and
is
this
economic
pressure
that
should
be
allowed
to
flow
between
parties
under
the
statute
of
section
7.
as
nlra
have
stated,
there
is
no
collective
bargaining
in
a
pre-decisional
fact-finding
investigation.
there
is
no
decision
here
that
an
employer
who
deals
with
employee
merely
to
elicit
facts
is
circumventing
the
provisions
of
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
act.
in
fact,
the
legislative
intent
does
not
manifest
an
employee
may
control
the
employer's
avenue
of
gaining
information
concerning
his
operations.
the
idea
of
mutual
aid
or
protection
has
been
discussed.
what
is
a
dichotomy
and
perhaps
an
anomaly
is
the
fact
that
the
board
is
taking
the
position
that
these
collective
interest
do
not
rise
to
a
level
sufficient
to
permit
the
union
to
be
present,
but
do
rise
to
a
level
who
will
permit
the
employee
to
institute
representational
assistance
if
he
so
desired.
it's
difficult
for
us
to
understand
why
if
the
union
requests
the
representation,
it
is
not
permitted,
and
while
the
employee
requested
it
is.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
same
rights
would
be
involved
regardless
of
the
party
requesting
representation.
the
labor
board
has
imputed
or
implied
that
an
employee
when
he
re-seeks
the
aid
of
his
representative
or
another
employee
is
engaged
in
protected
concerted
activity,
this
implies
that
employee
is
not
seeking
self
protection
or
protection
against
questions
which
may
be
embarrassing
or
particularly
proving
that
that
he
is
seeking
to
in
the
future
make
a
situation
where
other
employees
will
be
accorded
similar
treatment.
now,
this
is
a
factor
which
has
not
been
explored
by
the
record,
but
it
is
imputed
to
an
employee
by
the
labor
board
that
when
he
does
request
that
a
union
representative
be
present,
it
is
for
concerted
activity,
when
in
fact
it
may
be
for
self-preservation
as
oppose
to
any
effort
or
motivation
on
a
concerted
basis.
it's
been
stated
that
the
contracts
in
many
major
companies
provide
for
representation
of
an
employee
in
an
investigatory
interview.
the
fact
that
this
is
in
industrial
situations
today,
we
believe
to
be
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
right
to
bargain
collectively
for
the
right
of
representation
of
employee
at
an
investigatory
interview
has
not
been
diluted
by
the
prior
position
of
the
board
that
no
right
existed
in
the
context
of
a
fact-finding
investigation.
in
fact,
the
board
has
not
taken
the
position
today
that
any
of
its
prior
decisions
had
been
reversed.
in
a
prior
case
of
date
and
typographic
where
the
employer
is
sought
the
question
employees
about
errors
that
they
made
in
proofreading.
the
trial
examiner
of
the
labor
board
found
that
there
was
no
concerted
activity
and
the
board
adopted
that
position,
yet
the
board
has
not
attempted
to
reverse
that
decision
or
other
decisions
which
have
created
this
dichotomy
between
investigatory
and
disciplinary
reviews.
the
idea
that
an
employee
is
statutorily
protected
from
interviews
by
his
employee,
presupposes
that
there
is
an
adversary
condition,
that
there
is
a
situation
where
an
employee
is
immediately
placed
under
suspicion
or
under
fear
of
adverse
consequences.
and
to
permit
an
employee's
speculation
as
to
what
an
employer
may
do
with
information
that
he
gathers
is
to
take
the
employer
his
unfair
labor
practice
completely
out
of
his
intent
or
purpose.
for
an
employee,
may
wrongly
suppose
that
an
employee's
questions
and
employer's
questions
may
result
in
disciplinary
action.
the
case
that's
before
this
court
involved
a
suspicion
theft.
the
case
that
involved
the
labor
board
decision
of
texaco
los
angeles
terminal
involved
the
situation
where
an
employee
refused
to
drive
a
piece
of
equipment
which
he
deemed
to
be
defective.
in
that
case,
the
trial
examiner
found
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
act
because
the
employee
on
one
point
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
his
job
status
was
in
jeopardy.
it
is
difficult
for
us
representing
employers
to
determine
which
belief
of
the
labor
board
is
to
be
followed,
where
they
adopt
decisions
by
administrative
larger
as
use
on
a
trial
examiners
that
questions
concerning
insubordination
do
not
raised
the
level
of
reasonable
fear,
whereas
they
say
that
questions
concerning
thefts
do
raise
that
fear.
it's
been
stated
that
the
prior
--
mr.
neil
martin
yes,
but
as
we
understand
it
--
mr.
neil
martin
no,
the
cases
appeared
to
exist
coequally
without
the
distinction
being
drawn
between
while
one
questioning
concerning
insubordination
would
not
raised
reasonable
fear,
and
while
other
questioning
concerning
or
insubordination
would
raise
that
fear.
the
test
of
reasonable
fear
of
an
employee
has
no
relationship
to
the
realities
of
the
circumstances.
there
is
no
relationship
between
the
results
of
the
interview
and
whether
an
employee
may
reasonably
fear
that
his
job
sasses
in
jeopardy.
mr.
neil
martin
no
your
honor,
i
do
not
because
there
is
no
statutory
basis
for
it.
it
has
been
created
in
a
situation
of
the
only
decision
i
know
which
is
of
the
texaco
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
1969.
in
that
particular
context,
the
labor
board
found
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
because
the
employer
violated
the
employee's
right
to
union
representation,
and
it
was
a
disciplinary
interview.
mr.
neil
martin
upon
appeal,
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
they
found
no
basis
upon
which
an
employer
is
required
to
permit
an
employee
represent
to
be
present,
and
further
that
the
investigation
was
not
disciplinary,
but
it
was
an
investigatory.
mr.
neil
martin
it
is
that
dichotomy
which
has
been
created
because
of
the
decision
of
that
court.
mr.
neil
martin
well
your
honor,
the
only
--
in
the
context
of
deciding
upon
which
basis
an
employer
will
permit
an
employees'
request
and
will
not,
it
is
far
more
comfortable
for
an
employer
to
face
the
disciplinary
interview
dichotomy
than
it
is
the
situation
which
is
now
pressed
upon
us
by
the
labor
board.
mr.
neil
martin
we're
of
the
position
that
for
the
statute
does
not
require
union
representation,
an
employee's
request
for
union
representation
at
either
--
mr.
neil
martin
--
an
investigatory
or
a
disciplinary
interview.
mr.
neil
martin
until
the
man
--
mr.
neil
martin
correct.
there
has
been
previous
decision
involving
what
was
termed
inchoate
grievance.
that
is
a
pre-decisional
matter.
and
the
board
again
found
that
disciplinary
action
was
so
remote
that
it
did
not
want
finding
of
a
violation,
and
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
dichotomy
is
not
soundly
based
in
statute,
but
it
is
far
more
of
a
reasonable
standard
for
both
of
the
employer
and
the
employee
to
rest
upon,
then
a
decision
which
is
based
upon
the
employees.
mr.
neil
martin
we
--
mr.
neil
martin
that
either,
an
investigatory
or
disciplinary
interview.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
neil
martin
that's
correct.
mr.
neil
martin
i'm
sorry,
i
did
not
catch
all
of
your
questions.
mr.
neil
martin
the
--
mr.
neil
martin
oh,
yes
and
that's
the
position
that
both
of
the
employer
and
the
labor
board
have
taken
consistently
that
it
was
for
purposes
of
investigation.
mr.
neil
martin
well
the
case
--
the
question
concerning
disciplinary
action,
we
do
not
feel
is
before
us
on
our
fact
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
martin
because
the
purpose
of
the
interview
was
not
to
determine
the
extent
of
discipline,
nor
was
there
a
decision
made
that
discipline
would
be
taken
before
the
interview
began.
mr.
neil
martin
the
purpose
of
the
interview
was
to
determine
if
there
was
a
basis
for
the
suspicions
which
had
been
created
in
the
mind
of
the
employer
by
a
fellow
employee
of
mrs.
collins,
who
was
under
the
impression
that
she
had
taken
more
chicken
than
she
had
paid
for.
but
if
the
record
is
clear
that
neither
party
that
was
present
for
the
employer
had
authority
to
make
any
decision
concerning
discipline
based
upon
the
facts.
mr.
neil
martin
the
loss
prevention
specialists
is
a
broad
title
which
compasses
more
than
merely
thefts.
in
the
retail
industry,
there
is
a
phrase
called
“shrinkage”
and
that
can
occurred
from
many
reasons.
an
investigation
--
mr.
neil
martin
including
stealing.
mr.
neil
martin
breakage
or
items
not
shipped
in
transit.
there'll
be
many
reasons
why
a
loss
would
present
aside
from
any
employee
thefts.
mr.
neil
martin
she
could
have
terminated
the
interview
so
--
if
she
had
desired
and
have
--
could've
refuse
to
answer
any
questions,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
martin
she
can
only
been
fired
legitimately
under
the
provisions
of
contract
had
there
been
just
cause
for
the
termination.
mr.
neil
martin
the
case
that
was
raised
--
the
fact
situations
in
a
quality
manufacturing
case
are
distinguished
--
are
distinguishable
from
our
case.
mr.
neil
martin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
martin
correct
your
honor;
that's
correct.
the
present
position
of
the
board
besides
leaving
other
decisions
which
apparently
are
conflicts
upon
their
face
also
placed
both
the
employee
and
the
employee
at
their
own
peril.
it
subjects
the
employee
to
a
review
by
persons
other
than
himself
or
herself
in
this
case
as
to
what
is
reasonable
cause
or
what
reasonable
grounds
is
submitted
that
had
this
case
been
decided
in
1971,
the
labor
board
would
have
taken
the
position
and
no
violation
occurred.
for
an
illinois
telephone
case,
the
employee
was
called
in
concerning
alleged
thefts.
he
was
asked
concerning
a
thefts,
he
requested
union
representation,
the
company
repeatedly
denied
that
representation,
and
he
furnished
a
statement
admitting
the
thefts.
in
that
case,
the
labor
board
found
that
the
administrative
law
judge's
opinion
was
right
and
denied
the
contention
of
the
union
that
representation
should
be
afforded
in
investigatory
stages
of
those
cases
involving
misconduct,
which
could
result
conceivably
in
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
neil
martin
under
the
rule
as
you
stated
now
your
honor,
the
rule
says
where
it
may
possibly
result
in
the
decision
adversely
affecting
his
employment
status.
that
permits
a
broad
possibility
of
may
use
and
under
that
circumstance,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
an
employee
not
to
be
entitled
to
protection
because
he
could
fear
that
it
may
possibly
result
in
disciplinary
action
under
even
the
most
innocuous
circumstance.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
in
an
investigatory
interview,
there
is
no
coercive
atmosphere
automatically
and
imputed
to
it.
the
board
is
further
confused
the
issue
by
its
decision
in
western
electric
company.
there,
the
two
members,
panelo
and
kennedy
who
have
voted
that
there
was
no
statutory
right
or
joined
by
chairman
miller
who
found
that
where
the
employee
had
previously
arbitrated
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
an
employee
is
entitled
to
representations
at
an
investigatory
interview.
that
since,
it
had
been
previously
decided
adversely
to
the
union
in
the
prior
arbitration
cases
that
this
was
sufficient
to
permit
the
employer
to
deny
the
representation
in
this
case,
and
he
found
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
statutory
scheme
to
permit
such
a
ruling.
so,
where
we
have
a
situation
where
there
is
no
basis
upon
which
an
employer's
either
purpose
or
intention
or
knowledge
controls
his
own
unfair
labor
practices,
then
we
have
a
situation
where
speculation
or
subjective
state
of
mind
of
the
employee
controls
an
employer's
unfair
labor
practices.
and
the
role
of
the
union
representative
is
largely
unrefined
as
it
is
now
stated.
before
the
court
at
mobil,
the
board
took
the
position
that
the
representative
of
the
union
was
merely
there
present
as
an
advisor,
as
a
conciliator
perhaps.
if
you
follow
the
logic
of
the
board's
position
and
of
the
statute
where
the
union
is
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
its
employees,
then
perhaps
the
union
would
be
in
the
position
to
preclude
the
employer
from
directing
any
questions
to
the
employee
directly,
but
would
have
to
go
through
the
union
as
the
exclusive
representative
of
the
employee
to
direct
any
questions
concerning
the
employee's
activities.
we
would
summarize
by
saying
that
investigatory
interview
is
a
premature
stage
at
which
the
right
of
representation
exists
because
the
purpose
is
to
merely
elicit
in
a
true
fact-finding
investigation
the
facts
of
the
matter
and
not
to
pre-decide
or
to
pre-seal
a
decision
of
an
employer
or
the
faith
of
an
employee.
thank
you.
