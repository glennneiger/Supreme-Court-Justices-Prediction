burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
73-1363,
national
labor
relations
board
against
weingarten.
mr.
hardin,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
that
such
an
interview
is
this,
the
preliminary
interview
where
you
do
not
conceive
the
right
have
a
friend
there
that
the
employee
could
make
statements
that
would
be
incriminating,
and
now
distinguishing,
your
case
is
not
part
of
the
state,
it's
not
a
governmental
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
fifth
amendment
sense.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
i
take
it
you
distinguished
the
situation
to
which
you
just
responded
from
the
typical
official
incrimination.
on
that
ground,
i
suggested
that
you
are
not
part
of
any
governmental
apparatus;
this
is
a
private
contractual
arrangement
between
an
employer
and
an
employee.
and
that
in
the
traditional
sense,
the
fifth
amendment
protections
do
not
reach
that,
is
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
martin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hardin,
you
have
about
three
minutes
left
mr.
hardin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
of
anything
that
could
prevent
every
collective
bargaining
contract
to
contain
a
provision
that
representation
would
be
allowed
in
all
these
circumstances
--
all
is
formerly
one
to
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
some
differences
of
view
and
the
negotiations
on
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
could
rate
it
into
every
contract
if
there
was
agreement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
brennan.
