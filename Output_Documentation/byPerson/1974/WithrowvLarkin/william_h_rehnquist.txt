justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
read
you
a
sentence
from
28
usc
section
1253
in
order
to
call
my
brother
stewart's
attention
to
it
and,
“except
as
otherwise
provided
by
law,
any
party
may
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
from
an
order
granting
or
denying
after
a
notice
in
hearing
and
interlocutory
or
permanent
injunction”.
now
i
take
it
that
you
meet
the
--
even
if
you
take
it
that
the
amended
judgment
as
before
and
it's
an
amended
judgment.
it's
an
interlocutory
injunction
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
“required
to
be
heard
by
a
court
of
three
judges”.
now,
if
it
meets
that
test,
it
certainly
wasn't
interlocutory
injunction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
friebert,
in
arizona
where
i
practiced,
i
sat
on
one
of
the
grievance
committees
and
we
would
have
a
session
of
that
committee
whereby
we
would
hear
complaints
and
hear
a
complaining
witness
and
simply
decide
whether
there
was
sufficient
basis
to
go
ahead
and
notify
that
the
lawyer
was
being
complained
against
and
if
we
decided
that
there
was
no
sufficient
basis
we
dismiss
it.
if
we
decide
there
was
sufficient
basis
then
we
would
notify
him
of
charges
and
hold
a
full
hearing.
now,
do
you
think
that
violates
the
three-judge
district
court's
opinion
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
precisely.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
true
in
arizona
too
after
the
administrative
committee
got
there,
went
to
the
board
of
governors
with
the
supreme
court
but
here
i
take
it
your
medical
thing
goes
eventually
under
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
agree
with
you
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
that
the
law
was
--
it's
sufficient
to
issue
a
preliminary
injunction
that
you
find
a
high
probability
of
success
but
surely,
if
you
wanted
--
if
the
court
wants
to
go
further
than
that
and
say,
this
isn't
just
a
high
probability
of
success
--
it's
a
hundred
percent
thing
in
our
eyes.
i
would
think
that
they're
perfectly
justified
that
the
preliminary
--
as
of
saying
this
is
unconstitutional,
an
argument
won't
change
our
minds
on
these
legal
points.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
required
to
be
heard
by
a
three-
judge
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
other
reason
for
the
three-judge
district
courts
enjoining
of
the
statute
in
this
case
than
its
serious
doubt
about
its
constitutionality,
was
there?
there
was
no
independent
basis
for
the
court
to
enjoin?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
doesn't
involve
economic
regulations.
certainly,
its
regulating
somebody's
way
of
making
a
living,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
aren't
we
talked
but
economic
regulation
here
to?
