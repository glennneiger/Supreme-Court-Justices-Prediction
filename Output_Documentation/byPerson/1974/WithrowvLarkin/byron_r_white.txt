justice

well
the
--
this
maybe
of
that
the
injunction
may
have
been
amended
but
the
court
had
already
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
--
they
withdraw
that
declaration?

the

justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friebert
who
actually
does
that
investigative
work?
do
they
have
runners
do
it
or
outside
investigators
or
do
the
members
of
the
board
themselves
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
a
right
of
conclusion
than
those
that
so
called
investigative
procedures
the
board
had
simply
suspended
the
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
board
just
sits
in
here
for
testimony
and
then
decide
that's
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so
but
would
be
because
of
external
function?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
so
it
wouldn't
be
the
mixing
function
probably,
it
would
be
a
procedural
due
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
have
produced
dr.
larkin?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
board
recommend
to
the
district
attorney
that
he
files
specific
certain
kinds
of
charges
against
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
in
accordance
with
the
statute
they
may
so
called
prefer
charges
with
the
district
attorney,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
--
i
would
suppose
that's
your
easiest
case
to
argue
and
maybe
you've
got
a
hard
case
and
no
matter
what
but
if
--
but
it's
easier
to
argue
that
you
put
that,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
if
they
wanted
to
proceed
to
a
contested
hearing
themselves.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
district
attorney
taken
any
action
at
all
either
for
revocation
or
on
the
criminal
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
the
situation
the
same?
i
know
this
is
outside
the
record
but
i'm
curious
as
to
dr.
keenan?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
statute
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
empowers
a
state
examining
board
to
license
physicians
and
to
investigate
charges
of
professional
misconduct
and
to
revoke
and
suspend
licenses.
when
proceedings
were
instituted
against
appellee,
he
resorted
to
the
federal
court
and
brought
this
suit.
he
claimed
that
the
statute
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
invalid
because
of
among
other
things
the
board
was
empowered
both
to
investigate
and
to
adjudicate.
and
he
claimed
that
this
violated
due
process
clause.
the
district
court
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
on
the
grounds
that
the
appellee
faced
irreparable
injury
and
that
he
would
very
likely
succeed
with
his
suit.
the
state
appealed
and
for
the
reasons
we
given
in
the
opinion
at
some
length,
we
unanimously
reverse.
in
our
view,
appellee
is
not
likely
to
succeed
on
the
constitutional
grounds
he
alleged
combining
investigative
and
adjudicating
functions
is
not
per
se
unconstitutional
and
it
is
not
unconstitutional
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
judgment
is
reversed.
