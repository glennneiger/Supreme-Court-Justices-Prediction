justice
potter
stewart
ms.
brown,
i
certainly
--
it's
not
my
purpose
to
disturb
the
planned
order
of
your
argument
but
i
trust
that
sometime
during
the
course
of
your
argument
you
will
get
to
the
point
that
the
three
judge
court
order
has
now
been
amended
and
no
longer
does
declare
a
statute
unconstitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
so
then
that
--
is
that
were
the
only
judgment
that
we
have
from
the
beginning,
it
would
be
very
clear
that
this
court
would
be
without
jurisdiction
of
this
appeal,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
just
looking
at
the
language
of
the
now
existing
judgment
which
appears
on
page
20
of
the
suggestion
of
mootness
filed
here
on
september
3.
it
doesn't
declare
anything
unconstitutional
but
just
enjoins
the
applications
of
these
statutes
against
the
plaintiff
duane
larkin
m.d.
on
the
grounds
that
he
would
suffer
irreparable
injury,
if
the
statute
were
to
be
applied
against
him
and
that
the
plaintiff's
challenged
to
the
constitutionally
of
said
statute
has
a
high
likelihood
of
success.
you
don't
--
we
don't
have
--
we
wouldn't
have
direct
appellate
jurisdiction
of
any
such
order
as
that,
would
we?
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
be
-
you
could
be
here,
could
you?
justice
potter
stewart
so
when
as
or
if
some
final
judgments
were
entered
declaring
this
statute
unconstitutional,
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
did
amend
their
judgment
of
january
31,
1974,
didn't
they?
that's
what
this
says
on
the
top
of
page
20.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
to
that
extent
they
did
change
the
original
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
from
the
gibson
v.
berryhill?
justice
potter
stewart
the
problem
is
if
i
may
say
so
in
the
first
action
of
december
of
1973,
they
held
this
statute
unconstitutional.
now,
in
july
of
1974,
they
seem
at
least
if
one
could
read
the
english
language
to
have
retreated
from
that
position
and
simply
said
that
the
plaintiff's
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
the
statute
has
a
high
likelihood
of
success.
now,
that
certainly
is
inconsistent
and
those
orders
are
different
things.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
ground
for
your
filing
on
this
document
on
this
september
3rd
suggestion
of
mootness?
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
that
you
do
not
think
of
this
amended
judgment
raises
a
question
as
to
the
predicate
of
our
jurisdictions
to
review
either
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
waste
of
time
or
not,
if
we
don't
have
jurisdiction,
we
don't
have
jurisdiction
whatever
maybe
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
we're
to
take
the
only
judgment
before
us
as
the
amended
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
only
preliminary
injunctions
entered
on
grounds
of
constitutionality?
