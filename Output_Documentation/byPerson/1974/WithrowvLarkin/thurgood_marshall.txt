that
before

if

justice
thurgood
marshall
where

takes
place
of

--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
dr.

talking
about
fact.
justice
thurgood

what
it
seems

asking.

that
he
was
operating

justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
you
deny
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
rewarded
by
hitting
the
paper.
you
made
a
legal
argument
and
that's
all
you
made,
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
didn't
question
the
facts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
statute
now,
in
wisconsin
