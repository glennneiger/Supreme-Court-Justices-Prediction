mr.
friebert,
what
do
you
consider
as
before
this
court
as
of
today?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
interrupt
you
a
minute.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you're
not
quite
answering
the
question
i
had
in
mind
or
perhaps
is
not
clear
that
two
orders
that
were
entered
in
this
case
had
been
discussed
the
other
day,
the
one
on
december
21,
1973,
the
subsequent
one
of
74,
the
july
25,
i
think.
do
you
consider
both
of
them
to
be
before
us
if
not,
which
one?
