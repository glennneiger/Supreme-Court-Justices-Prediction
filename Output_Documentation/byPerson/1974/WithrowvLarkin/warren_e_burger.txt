chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1573,
withrow
against
larkin.
ms.
brown
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
if
it
is
that
might
have
--
i
think
you're
suggesting
your
briefs
on
the
impact
on
the
federal
communications
commissions
for
example.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
tell
us
to
what
evidence
was
taken
on
this
subject
or
did
the
court
act
solely
on
the
pleadings?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
the
evidence
that
the
information
that
the
board
acquired
in
its
investigatory
process,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
know
whether
it's
relevant
here
in
this
ground
at
issue
but
as
you
know
often,
would
it
be
a
violation
of
a
wisconsin
statute
of
some
kind
to
have
a
license
under
one
name
and
carry
on
to
practice
of
medicine
under
another
name?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apart
from
the
medical
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
may
not
be
of
sure
guarantee
but
it
might
be
a
big
help.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
the
same
three-judge
court?
have
you
been
before
the
same
three-judges
all
the
time
in
this
proceeding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
in
effect
in
order
to
show
cause
functionality?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
affidavits
that
you've
described
that
were
before
the
board
in
the
investigation
stage,
was
there
any
denial
by
dr.
larkin
of
his
--
of
these
allegation
about
practicing
--
holding
out
practice
under
another
name?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
did
he
deny
it
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
claim
made
in
the
oral
argument
before
the
three
judge
court
that
this
was
a
class
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
if
the
statute
were
in
fact
and
law,
unconstitutionally
it
would
apply
to
everyone
whether
it
had
a
class
action
or
not,
i
assume?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
his
probability
of
success
would
depend
upon
his
denial
and
refuting
the
information
that
was
before
the
medical
board.
could
the
court
make
any
evaluation
of
his
probability
of
success
on
what
it
had
before
it
without
any
denial
from
him?
could
the
three-judge
court
make
any
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
the
tro?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
preliminary
injunction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friebert,
at
some
point
will
you
touch
on
the
mayo
against
the
canning
company
and
tell
us
what
you
think
that
has
to
do
with
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
know
if
it's
in
your
brief
but
it's
in
this
case.
relies
on
this
very
heavily
and
so,
among
other
things,
while
in
this
court
the
celibacy
is
not
binding
in
the
state
of
ohio.
there's
a
statement
that
it
is
of
the
highest
importance
to
a
proper
review
in
the
granting
or
refusing
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
every
explicit
findings
of
fact
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
in
rule
528
was
bound
which
we're
just
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
did
they
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
suppose
that
was
partly
because
there
was
no
contest
after
notice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
dr.
larkin
undertook
to
put
in
no
evidence,
never
denied
the
charges,
if
that's
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
get
a
notice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
said
this
was
the
denied,
by
what
process
or
means
was
this
denied?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
that
dr.
larkin,
mr.
larkin
whatever
he
is
denied
this
thing,
quoted
he
denies
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
after
lunch.
you
may
continue
mr.
friebert,
you
have
a
few
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
the
district
attorney
decided
not
to
prefer
charges,
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
supports
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
the
district
attorney
like
others
is
just
waiting
for
the
outcome
of
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
we
don't
agree
with
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
don't
know
that,
this
case
we
arguing
today?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
since
you
mention
the
federal
trade
commission,
isn't
this
some
of
the
alleged
conduct
found
by
the
board
that
is
he's
setting
up
an
office
under
a
false
name,
something
like
miss
brandy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
petition
was
never
denied,
he
is
never
denied,
the
boards
determination
made
on
sworn
testimony
that
he
opened
an
office
in
milwaukee
under
a
false
name.
chief
justice
warren
