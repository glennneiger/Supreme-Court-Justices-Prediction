ms.
betty
r.
brown
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin
in
which
that
court
declared
section
448.18
(7)
of
the
wisconsin
statutes
unconstitutional
and
preliminarily
enjoined
all
utilization
of
that
subsection
of
the
statute.
this
preliminary
injunctive
relief
was
granted
in
an
action
brought
in
the
district
court
under
the
civil
rights
act
by
the
appellee
whose
name
is
dr.
larkin
against
the
appellants
who
are
the
members
of
the
wisconsin
medical
examining
board.
there
are
three
questions
in
this
case.
the
first
question
is
whether
a
district
court
in
granting
a
mere
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
can
declare
a
state
statute
unconstitutional
and
preliminarily
enjoin
all
utilization
of
that
statute.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
that's
right.
over
six
months
after
this
appeal
was
taken
and
jurisdiction
was
noted
and
the
briefs
were
submitted.
there
was
a
modification
of
the
judgment
and
so
we
also
have
that
situation
presently
existing,
in
which
the
court
instead
of
saying
as
an
orally
declared
and
as
included
in
its
decision
and
judgment
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
it
now
in
the
modified
judgment
said
there
is
a
likelihood
of
success
and
it
also
without
any
evidence
to
support
this
modified
the
judgment
to
assert
that
there
is
irreparable
harm.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
so
there
has
been
--
ms.
betty
r.
brown
no,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
we
wouldn't
be
here
your
honor
if
that
was
the
initial
order.
but
we
--
ms.
betty
r.
brown
right,
but
we
would
have
been
here
because
of
the
content
of
the
decision
which
would
be
followed
by
a
final
injunctive
order
and
it
came
to
same
conclusions
which
we
believe
are
completely
erroneous.
namely,
that
there's
a
violation
of
due
process
by
the
per
se
possession
of
investigative
and
adjudicative
powers
by
an
administrate
agency.
so
that
if
the
modified
judgment
had
been
entered
initially,
we
couldn't
be
here
but
when
the
final
judgment
was
entered
we
would've
been.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
well,
i
doubt
that
there
would
be
any
and
or
if
primarily
because
of
the
content
of
their
decision
your
honor
--
they
had
made
up
their
minds.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
no,
the
decision
is
still
in
effect,
it's
being
cited
and
it's
being
followed.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
yes,
yes
it
was
your
honor.
so
that
there
was
this
modification
but
there
is
also
of
course
other
questions
here
which
in
any
shape
or
form
will
arise
again
and
do
need
resolution.
and
this
of
course
is
the
real
question
on
the
merits
here
and
that
is
whether
the
per
se
by
itself
possession
and
exercised
by
an
administrative
agency
uphold
statutory
powers
to
investigate
and
statutory
powers
to
adjudicate
is
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
i
think
it
would
have
an
impact
your
honor
on
all
administrative
agencies,
state,
federal,
local,
i
think
that
it
has
an
impact.
i
think
that
under
the
broad
holding
in
this
case
the
federal
administrative
procedure
act
is
unconstitutional
because
it
does
recognize
that
these
various
functions
which
are
the
basic
nature
of
administrative
agencies
can
exist
and
be
exercised
by
such
agencies.
there
is
also
a
third
question
here
which
i
think
is
a
very
important
one
and
that
is
whether
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
district
court
had
any
discretion,
any
power
to
grant
a
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
if
it
had
any
discretion
whether
it
abused
that
discretion
in
this
case.
the
fact
situation
somewhat
briefly
i
hope
is
this.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
in
any
shape
or
form
which,
either
showed
the
availability
of
injunctive
relief
in
this
type
of
case
or
established
grounds
for
the
granting
of
the
motion.
there
was
nothing,
no
evidence
in
the
form
of
testimony,
in
the
form
of
affidavits,
in
any
shapes
or
form,
which
established
that
there
was
no
adequate
remedy
at
law,
that
there
had
been
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
if
applicable,
that
there
would
be
irreparable
harm
if
the
requested
relief
was
not
granted,
that
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
and
that
granting
the
relief
would
not
do
or
undo
harm
to
the
public
interest,
which
of
course
i
think
your
honors
is
a
big
and
important
concern
when
we
are
dealing
with
state
statutes
which
are
aimed
at
protecting
the
welfare
of
the
citizens
of
the
state.
there
was
no
evidence
at
any
of
these
in
any
shape
or
form.
the
facts
are
briefly
this,
dr.
larkin
who
was
the
appellee
here
is
a
resident
of
the
state
of
michigan.
he
applied
to
the
appellant's,
the
wisconsin
medical
examining
board
for
a
license
to
practice
medicine
in
the
state
of
wisconsin.
he
was
granted
that
license
in
august
1971
on
the
basis
of
the
reciprocity
provisions
between
the
wisconsin
and
michigan.
the
medical
examining
board
is
a
state
administrative
agency.
it's
the
agency
which
issues
license
to
practice
medicine
and
surgery.
it
is
an
agency
also
which
has
the
statutory
duty
to
investigate
practices
and
amicable
to
public
health
and
if
it
finds
such
practices
to
either
warn
or
reprimand
the
licensee
or
if
necessary
refer
the
matter
to
the
district
attorney
for
either
criminal
prosecution
or
civil
revocation
of
a
license.
the
board
itself
has
no
power
to
suspend
other
than
temporarily
or
revoke
the
medical
license
of
a
doctor.
this
has
to
be
--
ms.
betty
r.
brown
yes.
now,
this
is
one
of
the
unique
situations
in
which
a
professional
license
can
be
revoked
or
suspended
other
than
temporarily
only
by
a
court
and
not
by
the
administrative
agency
itself.
the
only
power
that
the
board
has
is
under
the
statute
which
the
court
here
declared
unconstitutional,
section
448.18
(7)
and
this
statute
allows
the
board
to
temporarily
suspend
the
license
of
a
licensee
for
not
more
than
three
months
upon
a
determination
that
he
is
engaged
in
practices
which
are
immoral
or
unprofessional
in
nature.
they
also
have
power
to
extend
this
for
another
three
months
but
that's
a
maximum
of
their
suspension
powers.
well,
dr.
larkin
did
get
his
license
on
the
basis
of
reciprocity,
he
very
promptly
went
to
milwaukee
wisconsin
and
he
rented
offices
and
he
did
so
under
an
alias,
he
used
name
glenn
johnson
instead
of
his
own
name
in
renting
these
offices
and
he
began
performing
abortions.
he
performed
this
every
weekend.
he
flew
in
from
detroit
to
milwaukee
and
on
friday,
saturday
and
sunday's,
he
performed
abortions
and
then
he
returned
to
the
state
of
michigan.
it
appears
that
by
february
of
1973,
in
other
words,
about
a
year-and-half
after
he
started,
he
himself
was
coming
to
milwaukee
and
only
very
infrequent
occasions
and
evidence
indicated
that
he
was
there
once
between
february
of
1973
and
the
date
of
this
federal
court
activity
in
the
latter
of
part
of
1973.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
right
sir.
the
only
evidence
in
this
record
is
in
the
form
of
affidavits.
attached
to
some
of
the
affidavits
are
various
notices
and
there
is
also
attached
the
board's
findings
of
facts,
conclusions
of
law
and
decision
which
it
arrived
at,
at
the
conclusion
of
its
investigative
hearing.
and
it's
in
that
material
which
is
part
of
the
record
attached
to
affidavits
that
this
material
has
revealed.
so
that
he
was
flying
in
and
performing
these
abortions
over
weekends
but
since
february
of
1953,
his
abortion
business
was
being
carried
on
primarily
by
others
with
a
financial
arrangement
between
a
dr.
larkin
and
another
doctor.
in
june
of
1973,
the
board
issued
and
it
mailed
to
dr.
larkin
a
notice
of
investigative
hearing.
it
was
about
to
perform
its
duty
under
section
448.17
of
the
statutes
to
investigate
practices
inamicable
to
public
health.
it
sent
this
notice
dr.
larkin,
told
him
the
subject
--
it
included
the
subject
of
the
investigation,
it
invited
dr.
larkin
with
or
without
counsel
to
attend
although
the
investigation
was
ex
parte
in
character.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
yes
sir,
it's
a
violation
of
the
criminal
law
and
it
--
ms.
betty
r.
brown
right.
there
is
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
for
a
medical
licensee
under
certain
circumstances
to
use
a
name
other
than
the
name
under
which
he
was
licensed.
there
are
ifs,
ands,
and
buts
in
the
statute
but
that's
the
sense
of
it,
and
in
addition
of
course
that
is
a
practice
inamicable
to
public
health
because
the
patient
has
no
idea
whom
he's
dealing
with.
it's
a
sure
guarantee
against
malpractice
suits
among
other
things
which
have
become
increasingly
popular
when
you
don't
even
know
who
the
individual
is
who
performing
services
on
you.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
well,
it's
a
hindrance
anyway.
so
the
board
sent
out
this
notice
of
investigative
hearing
and
upon
received
of
that
notice,
dr.
larkin
immediately
followed
--
filed
a
civil
rights
action
in
the
federal
district
court.
in
this
action,
he
sought
initially
only
injunctive
relief.
he
sought
a
temporary
restraining
order
of
preliminary
injunction
and
a
permanent
injunction
aimed
at
stopping
the
investigative
hearing.
the
district
court
judge
denied
the
motion
for
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
larkin
very
promptly,
that
is
six
days
later
filed
an
unverified
amended
complaint,
an
innocent
amended
complain.
he
sought
not
only
injunctive
relief
but
he
also
sought
declaratory
relief.
he
sought
the
declaration
that
the
wisconsin
statutes
section
448.17
and
448.18
(7)
were
unconstitutional
and
he
asked
for
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court.
there
was
in
the
interim
some
more
motions
and
various
affidavits
filed
but
the
district
court
refused
to
enjoin
the
investigative
hearing
and
that
hearing
was
held
as
scheduled
on
july
12
and
13,
1973.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
yes,
that
is
the
three-judge
court
was
not
formed
at
the
time
that
i'm
referring
to
right
now,
they
were
formed
shortly
afterwards.
the
investigative
hearing
by
the
board
was
allowed
to
proceed.
it
was
not
until
the
board
sent
notice
of
a
contested
hearing
and
those
words
contested
hearing
under
wisconsin
law
have
a
great
deal
of
significance
because
there
is
a
whole
array
of
procedural
rights
that
are
attached
at
that
point.
but
the
board
did
operating
under
another
statute,
not
the
one
giving
them
a
duty
to
investigate
but
operating
under
448.18
(7),
which
gives
them
power,
limited
power
to
temporarily
suspend
the
license.
they
did
send
to
dr.
larkin
a
notice
of
contested
hearing
on
the
subject
of
whether
his
license
should
be
temporarily
suspended.
that
notice
is
set
forth
at
length
in
the
brief
and
as
you
will
note,
it
very
carefully
sets
forth
the
issues
at
the
proposed
contested
hearing.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
well,
it
really
was
more
than
that,
it
was
really
bringing,
starting
up
a
whole
contested
proceeding
in
which
the
person
had
a
right
to
be
present,
to
testify,
to
have
counsel,
to
cross
examine
witnesses,
to
a
written
statement
of
the
issues,
to
the
burden
of
proof
on
his
opponent,
a
whole
list
which
i
have
set
forth
with
statutory
reference
in
one
of
the
footnotes
to
my
brief,
but
it
was
a
whole
complicated
procedure
in
which
there
was
very
careful
guarding
of
procedural
rights
of
a
licensee.
but
at
the
point
where
he
got
this
notice
of
a
contested
hearing,
dr.
larkin's
attorney
again
went
into
court
and
again
sought
a
temporary
restraining
order,
preliminary
injunction,
et
cetera.
not
of
the
investigative
which
was
the
sole
subject
of
the
pleading's
in
this
case
but
of
the
proposed
contested
hearing
on
whether
his
license
should
be
revoked.
in
getting
this
material
the
district
court
without
any
hearing
whatsoever
did
enter
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
did
grant
the
motion
for
a
three-judge
court.
so
a
three-judge
court
was
then
convened
and
the
three-judge
court
held
a
none
evidently
hearing
on
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction.
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
any
shape
or
form
which
went
to
the
question
of
whether
a
preliminary
injunction
should
issue.
there
also
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
presented
and
quite
properly
so,
on
the
subject
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
presumptively
constitutional
wisconsin
statutes.
so
that
the
hearing
before
the
three-judge
court
was
oral
argument
period,
without
even
a
pleading
based
for
the
relief
being
sought.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
no.
before
the
board
your
honor
there
weren't
affidavits,
there
was
actual
sworn
testimony
by
witnesses
before
the
board.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
he
was
invited
to
attend
and
he
was
also
invited
to
come
before
the
board
and
to
inform
it
of
any
explanation
or
any
material
he
wish
to
present
to
the
board
during
their
investigative
hearing
and
he
declined
to
do
so.
his
counsel
sat
through
the
entire
investigative
hearing
and
his
counsel
did
address
the
board
but
dr.
larkin
himself
never
appeared
and
never
informed
the
board
despite
its
invitation
of
any
material
which
would
cast
doubt
upon
or
reflection
upon
the
sworn
testimony
and
other
evidence
that
the
board
itself
took
during
its
investigation.
but
the
three-judge
court
during
this
argument
on
preliminary
injunction,
off
the
bench,
declares
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
it
also
enjoins
the
use
of
the
statute
not
only
against
dr.
larkin
but
against
everybody.
it
came
down
with
the
decision
that
--
and
here
i'm
quoting
them
for
the
board
temporarily
to
suspend
dr.
larkin's
license
which
of
course
the
board
hadn't
done,
at
its
own
contested
hearing
on
charges
evolving
from
its
own
investigation
would
constitute
a
denial
to
him
of
rights
to
procedural
due
process.
insofar
as
the
statute
authorizes
a
procedure
where
in
a
physician
stands
to
lose
his
liberty
or
property,
absent
the
intervention
of
an
independent
neutral
and
detached
decision
maker,
we
conclude
that
it
is
unconstitutional
and
enforceable.
so,
in
response
to
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction,
they
did
enter
a
decision
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional,
banning
all
utilization
of
the
statute
against
everybody
and
then
subsequently
they
came
down
with
their
judgment.
originally,
they
did
this
orally,
then
they
wrote
a
decision,
then
they
entered
a
judgment
and
in
all
of
these
they
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
enjoined
all
utilization.
from
the
judgment
so
declaring
the
appellant's
appeal
to
this
court,
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction,
my
brief
was
submitted,
the
other
side's
brief
was
submitted
and
the
board
found
itself
with
this
order
banning
all
utilization
of
the
statute
so
crippling
that
the
interest
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
were
being
harmed.
so
the
board
did
go
to
the
three-judge
court
and
asked
for
a
modification
so
that
the
injunction
would
only
protect
dr.
larkin
and
not
prohibit
the
board
from
utilizing
the
statute
against
everybody.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
no,
no,
no,
there
is
no
class
action
aspect
to
this
at
all.
the
--
ms.
betty
r.
brown
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
so
that
we
did
ask
this
modification
of
the
judgment
in
order
to
make
the
preliminary
injunctions,
they
should
properly
have
been
run
only
against
dr.
larkin.
well,
the
court
then
took
an
opportunity
to
change
its
judgment
in
a
more,
much
more
broader
way.
they
did
what
we
asked.
in
other
words,
allowing
the
board
to
proceed
against
others
but
they
also
came
up
with
this
fiction
about
irreparable
harm
to
dr.
larkin
in
which
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
and
there
was
not
even
an
allegation
that
he
would
suffer
irreparable
harm
if
the
preliminary
injunction
was
not
granted.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
i
would
submit
to
you
--
well,
in
the
first
place,
we
don't
know
whether
he
was
going
to
be
suspended
at
all.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
he
could
be,
right.
but
we
have
in
this
situation
--
ms.
betty
r.
brown
it
could
be
an
irreparable
harm
and
some
situations
but
i
would
submit
to
you
justice
marshall
that
we
have
some
unique
facts
in
this
case
and
that
is
--
ms.
betty
r.
brown
there
are
some
facts
--
there
are
no
facts
establishing
a
base
for
the
issuance
of
a
preliminary
injunction.
there
are
facts
otherwise
and
one
of
the
facts
is
that
dr.
larkin
is
a
resident
of
the
state
of
michigan.
he
is
licensed
to
practice
--
ms.
betty
r.
brown
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
sure.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
in
the
form
of
the
proceedings
and
notices
of
the
board
which
were
attached
to
affidavits
filed
with
the
pleadings
and
with
some
other
affidavits.
but
what
i
am
saying
--
ms.
betty
r.
brown
there
were
affidavits
your
honor
but
my
point
is
that
they
did
not
relate
in
any
way
to
whether
or
not
a
preliminary
injunction
could
issue
in
this
case.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
i
certainly
would
--
ms.
betty
r.
brown
--
if
the
bar
association
of
wisconsin
did
and
i
was
practicing
in
wisconsin.
if
i
was
a
member
of
the
michigan
bar
and
i
flew
into
wisconsin
once
in
six
months,
i
don't
know
that
the
injury
would
be
so
great.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
well,
the
facts
are
your
honor
that
dr.
larkin
had
a
license
to
practice
medicine
in
michigan.
at
the
time
of
these
hearings,
he
was
not
coming
to
wisconsin,
other
than
on
very
infrequent
occasions.
his
operation
in
milwaukee
was
being
run
by
others
with
whom
he
shared
the
fees.
he
was
not
personally
in
the
day
to
day
business
of
sitting
in
an
office
and
having
patients
come
to
him
for
medical
service
and
he
was
practicing
medicine
in
the
state
of
michigan
where
he
was
physically
present
on
all
but
very
few
occasions.
so
that
under
these
circumstances
your
honor,
i
doubt
that
they
could
establish
have
they
attempted
to
do
so
which
they
did
not
do
but
i
doubt
that
they
could
have
established
the
type
of
irreparable
harm
which
this
court
has
recently
talked
about
in
all
cases
such
as
sampson
versus
murray.
there
is
no
way
i
believe
that
they
could
have
established
that
but
the
point
is
your
honor,
they
didn't
even
try.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
the
only
thing
in
this
of
course
is
another
very
important
point.
the
only
thing
the
three-judge
court
did
was
to
issue
the
decision,
there
were
no
findings
of
fact,
there
were
no
conclusions
of
law
as
are
required
by
rule
52.
now
of
course,
that
rule
requires
finding
of
facts
and
conclusions
of
law
but
it
gives
an
alternative
that
is
instead
of
being
in
that
form
it
can
be
in
the
form
of
the
judgment
or
the
decision.
but
the
decision
in
this
case
which
of
course
is
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix
contains
no
findings
of
facts
or
conclusions
of
law
as
required
by
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
yes
your
honor.
rule
52
does
provide
that
whether
it's
a
permanent
--
ms.
betty
r.
brown
i'm
sorry.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
asking,
it's
a
matter
of
mandatory
duty
on
the
courts
your
honor.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
i
was
not
trial
counsel
your
honor.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
i'm
informed
that
the
state,
on
behalf
of
the
appellants
there
was
a
motion
for
judgment
made
and
it
was
not.
in
fact
we
had
to
make
the
motion
for
judgment
in
order
to
have
compliance
with
the
federal
rules
about
entry
of
judgment
to
start
the
appeal
time
running.
and
it
was
in
response
to
our
motion
for
a
judgment
that
a
judgment
was
finally
entered
in
december.
before
that
they
just
issued
their
decision
and
that
was
it.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
well,
preliminary
injunction.
ms.
betty
r.
brown
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional
and
enjoining
all
the
utilization.
i
believe
my
time
is
up
your
honor
and
i
thank
you
for
your
attention.
