mr.
robert
h.
friebert
mayo
against
the
canning
company?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
is
that
in
my
brief
your
honor?
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
oh
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes
i'd
be
happy
to
comment
on
immediately
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
is
not
required
to
make
explicit
findings
of
fact,
if
it
takes
care
of
that
matter
within
a
written
opinion
and
i
believe
that
the
court
has
taken
care
of
that
matter
in
its
written
opinion.
the
federal
rule
civil
procedures
says
it
can
go
either
way
and
that's
the
way
they
went,
they
made
a
specific
finding
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
i
believe
that
the
three-judge
court
did
make
an
error
in
its
original
statement
by
not
saying
that
there
was
irreparable
injury.
although,
i
think
that
they
were
saying
that
without
using
the
magic
words.
they
indicated
he
would
lose
his
license
to
practice
and
they
also
indicated
he
would
have
a
loss
of
liberty
due
to
the
notoriety
of
having
been
a
person
who
lost
his
license
citing
appropriate
cases
from
this
court.
so
they
without
using
the
magic
words,
they
did
make
the
appropriate
findings.
when
the
state
went
back
and
asked
for
an
amendment
to
the
judgment
so
that
they
could
go
after
other
doctors,
i
filed
a
counter
request
that
they
make
the
formal
finding,
the
court
did
so.
i
think
that
that
was
their
intention
all
along.
so
they
have
used
now
the
magic
words,
although
i
think
that
their
opinion
did
file
along
the
court
with
the
federal
rule.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes
the
last
one
couple,
their
opinion
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
opinion
is
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
yes,
i
am
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
they
make
findings
that
there's
nothing
extremely
different
called
about
the
critical
facts
in
this
case.
this
issue
is
not
as
broad
as
the
state
would
make
it.
it
is
not
an
attempt
to
declare
entire
statutory
scheme
unconstitutional.
it
is
an
attempt
to
declare
an
entire
statutory
scheme
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
these
very
limited
factual
circumstances.
as
such,
it
would
not
have
the
major
impact
on
the
apa
and
we
submit
that
if
the
court
were
to
decide
against
us,
it
would
have
a
major
impact
on
administrative
proceedings
because
the
court
would
then
be
giving
its
stamp
of
approval
to
an
anything
goes
situation
because
this
is
about
as
aggravated,
a
mixing
of
function
as
one
can
imagine
on
the
facts,
and
the
reason
it
is
so
aggravated
is
because
it
is
not
just
a
question
of
mixing
a
functions
within
the
administrative
agency,
which
is
the
way
the
state
would
like
to
paint
the
picture,
that's
not
this
case.
this
case
involves
the
same
people,
the
appellants,
the
very
same
people
investigating
dr.
larkin
by
a
formal
investigation
which
they
characterized
in
the
trial
court
to
be
akin
to
a
grand
jury
investigation.
that's
what
they
told
the
trial
court
what
they
were
doing
and
since
they
made
the
representations
that
they
were
like
grand
jurors
engaging
in
an
investigation
on
two
occasions,
the
court,
the
trial
court,
not
a
three-judge
court
this
was
just
a
single
judge,
refused
a
temporary
restraining
order.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
in
this
instance,
testimony
was
taken
by
the
board,
brought
in
by
counsel
who
was
a
trial
counsel
in
this
case,
who
was
also
counsel
to
the
board
and
brought
in
by
an
employee
but
the
testimony
was
taken
by
these
board
members
themselves
and
they
questioned
these
people
and
hence
the
analogy
which
they
said
to
a
grand
jury.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
that
that
would
have
been
unconstitutional
--
first
of
all
i
think
would
violate
wisconsin
practice
because
there
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
i
think
without
giving
notice
that
that's
what
they
are
going
to
do
and
giving
me
an
opportunity
to
cross
examine
or
respond,
i
do.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
it
would
be
in
this
--
again,
in
this
case
because
i
did
not
receive
notice
that
that's
what
they
were
going
to
do.
it's
caught
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct,
which
i
consider
mixing
a
function
is
a
procedural
due
process
problem.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
same
group
would
then
be
the
trial
people?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
i
think
that
that
would
violate
procedural
due
process.
in
wisconsin,
i
might
add
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
with
respect
to
revoking
or
suspending
the
license
to
practice
law,
the
charges
are
brought
and
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
appoints
a
judge
to
separately
decide
the
factual
matters
and
then
the
matter
--
and
makes
a
recommendation.
so
there
is
a
splitting
of
functions
within
the
bar
in
wisconsin.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
medical
thing
goes
eventually
under
the
way
they
are
moving
in
this
case
to
two
courts.
i
should
state
at
the
conclusion
of
their
investigative
hearing,
they
issued
formal
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
in
those
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
they
resolved
each
and
every
factual
question
in
this
case.
that
case
was
then
transmitted
to
the
district
attorney
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no
i
don't.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
dr.
larkin
denies
the
charges
and
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
was
present
and
i
made
a
statement
as
to
the
reasons
why
this
board
--
why
these
charges
as
on
the
record
that
they
have
before
it,
this
is
not
in
the
record.
the
hearings
were
not
made
a
part
of
the
record
here
but
i
did
appear
and
i
did
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
didn't
--
it
was
on
my
advice.
i
didn't
see
any
reason
for
him
to
appear.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
oh
yes,
i
appeared
on
his
behalf,
he
appeared
through
counsel.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i'm
not
sure,
i
believe
so.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
because
i
made
an
extensive
legal
argument
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
oh
yes,
it's
a
factual
argument
and
legal
argument
which
appears
at
footnote
13
of
my
brief.
and
now,
i
would
like
to
state
because
i
think
it
is
important
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
did
he
by
testimony,
no.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
denied
that
they
had
sufficient
facts.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
i
denied
that
they
have
improved
that
there
was
personal
knowledge
of
some
of
the
allegations.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
denied
that
some
of
them
yes,
i
denied
that
the
so-called
unlicensed
physician
was
unlicensed
and
i
told
them
that
he
was
a
licensed
physician
at
all
times
in
south
korea
according
to
my
understanding.
they
knew
that
he
was
a
license
physician
in
georgia
and
wisconsin
allows
by
--
yes
it's
statutory
but
they
didn't
check
that
fact.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
denied
that,
yes.
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
just
because
he
signed
a
list,
dr.
larkin
hit
the
papers
in
milwaukee
in
october
of
1971
and
everybody
knew
who
he
has.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
and
i
challenge
that
they
did
not
have
all
the
facts?
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
was
not
given
an
opportunity
to
cross
examine
witnesses
and
i
had
no
subpoena
powers
--
i
had
no
subpoena
powers
in
the
hearing.
no.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
possibly.
that
was
not
in
my
advice,
i
saw
no
purpose
in
it.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
did
not
want
him,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
consider
the
major
issue
before
this
court
as
to
whether
an
administrative
agency
can
combine
each
and
every
function
of
investigation
of
accusatorial
and
decision
making
all
within
the
same
pursuits.
these
are
the
--
the
appellant's
had
all
of
these
roles
and
sought
to
--
they
were
not
restrained
when
they
were
investigating,
they
have
never
been
restrained
from
charging,
it
is
when
they
proposed
to
be
judges
of
their
charges
that
the
federal
three-judge
court
or
stepped
in
first
the
federal
district
court
considering
singly
and
then
the
federal
three-judge
court,
does
not
have
the
sweep
of
statement
of
counsel.
this
is
not
--
this
malpractice
is
totally
anathema
to
the
apa.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
they're
both
here.
i
really
view
the
subsequent
order
as
a
modification
but
really
more
of
an
explanation
of
what
they
had
said
previously.
they
really
said
that
in
their
opinion
but
the
point
was
missed,
it's
been
cleared
up
and
that's
how
i
view
the
subsequent
order.
if
of
course
it's
only
the
first
order,
well
then
i
think
a
reversal
could
be
done
in
one
sentence
to
tell
them
to
do
what
they
did
subsequently
and
then
were
no
further
along.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
in
fact
--
and
if
the
court
views
only
the
first
--
judgment
is
up
here,
it's
automatic,
they
should
not
have
declared
a
statute
unconstitutional
in
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
the
case
law
is
clear
on
that.
the
finding
that
they
have
to
make
is
a
high
probability
of
success
in
a
preliminary
injunction
stage
unless
they're
combining
the
preliminary
injunction
with
the
final
judgment
which
they
could
have
done
but
did
not
do.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
this
court
said
it
in
mayo
and
i
don't
wish
to
dispute.
i'm
not
asking
for
the
overturning
of
mayo.
i
think
that
that
was
an
error
by
the
three-judge
court
which
was
corrected
but
it
doesn't
get
us
along
the
road
much
because
they
would
go
back
down
and
they
would
do
what
they
did
and
the
same
basic
issues
remained.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
if
that
was
the
issue
before
the
court,
whether
they
should
not
have
issue
--
if
the
court
felt
that's
a
reason
and
not
a
probable
jurisdiction
and
ordered
it
to
oral
argument
was
because
they
made
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality,
then
that
issue
is
moot
because
they
have
subsequently
corrected
that
situation.
furthermore,
if
the
court
felt
that
they
were
in
error
for
not
making
an
explicit
finding
of
irreparable
injury,
they
have
now
done
so.
so
that's
the
reason
we're
here
and
those
two
issues
are
moot.
the
underlying
issues
are
not
really
mooted
except
that
i
think
and
it's
our
position
that
the
subtle
law
of
the
--
and
i
believe
is
a
subtle
law
is
that
you
cannot
combine
within
the
same
persons
all
of
the
functions
of
accusing,
investigating
and
then
proposing
to
be
the
judges
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it's
just
that
--
it
seems
like
such
a
waste
of
time
to
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
oh,
i
think
we
have
jurisdiction
under
either
circumstances,
an
appeal
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
oh
yes,
i
think
there
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--
because
the
statute
allows
appeals
from
preliminary
injunctions.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes
and
there
is
that
injunction
as
that.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
mr.
justice
brennan
i
believe
the
statute
allows
an
appeal
from
a
preliminary
injunction
restraining
the
enforcement
of
the
statute
which
doesn't
show
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
a
constitutional
defect.
it
certainly
does
originally.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
certainly
does,
i
don't
have
the
statute
before
me,
i
believe
it
an
appeal
from
a
preliminary
injunction
and
to
this
court
is
available
from
a
holding
of
a
preliminary
injunction
restraining
the
enforcement
of
a
statute
of
state
wide
application
which
is
this
situation.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
required
to
be
heard
a
three-
judge
court
which
is
at
stat
situation
by
definition.
and
so
i
think
we're
here.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no.
the
independent
basis
awaits
further
discovery
on
the
first
clause
of
action
which
is
that
our
assertion
and
which
we
would
intend
to
prove
if
when
--
if
when
we
get
back
if
necessary
that
the
board
is
biased
against
abortionist.
i
would
like
to
clear
up
some
thing
which
is
first
of
all,
ms.
brown
stated
that
the
complaint
did
not
challenge
the
suspension
authority
of
the
board
that
is
just
not
true.
the
complaint,
the
amended
complaint
at
paragraph
3
challenges
the
authority
of
the
board
under
448.18
to
suspend
the
license
and
temporarily
suspend
the
license
and
that
paragraph
3
refers
back
to
the
paragraph
preceding
for
its
reasons
and
one
of
the
reason
stated
is
without
being
afforded
a
trial
by
jury
or
by
persons
other
than
his
accusers.
the
complaint
--
the
amended
complaint
very
clearly
raises
this
issue
and
that
amended
complaint
was
in
court
before
the
board
decided
to
try
and
take
his
license
away
for
six
months.
so
we
were
in
the
court
house
before
that.
secondly,
the
charges
against
dr.
larkin
do
not
relate
to
his
professional
competency
and
i
think
that
that's
very
important.
there
is
no
exigent
circumstances
in
this
situation.
the
charges
against
him
are
all
for
past
practices
which
they
alleged
occurred
in
which
we
deny
or
assert
are
not
offenses
and
are
protected.
they
have
to
do
with
some
kind
of
fee
splitting
which
if
you
read
the
wisconsin
statute
on
it,
it's
comprehensible.
it
has
to
do
with
the
alleged
use
of
a
different
name
which
the
wisconsin
statute
does
not
prohibit
until
there
is
a
prior
finding
by
the
board
that
this
would
work
to
the
detriment,
no
prior
finding
was
there
and
it
has
to
do
with
using
an
unlicensed
physician,
physician
unlicensed
in
wisconsin.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
by
the
board?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
in
my
appearance
on
his
behalf
before
the
board,
which
i
told
them
and
made
these
arguments
to
them
and
which
i
think
also
demonstrates
at
least
that
the
--
well,
i'd
rather
not
state.
i
made
that
those
statements
as
contained
in
footnote
13
to
the
board
and
finally,
the
use
of
unlicensed
physician,
unlicensed
in
wisconsin.
there
are
two,
there
is
a
factual
defense,
one
and
a
--
two
factual
defenses,
one
he
was
licensed
in
another
country
and
under
a
prevailing
opinion
of
the
attorney
general,
a
doctor
license
or
unlicensed
to
wisconsin
who
was
licensed
elsewhere
can
practice
in
conjunction
with
the
wisconsin
doctor
and
secondly,
that
an
unlicensed
doctor
or
person
can
practice
medicine
on
the
state
of
a
medical
emergency
which
is
our
opinion
was
created
by
the
very
board
themselves
due
to
their
extensive
harassment
over
a
period
of
two
years
of
persons
in
wisconsin
who
engaged
in
the
practice
of
abortions
despite
rulings
from
the
eastern
and
western
district
of
wisconsin
declaring
the
wisconsin
statute
unconstitutional.
dr.
larkin
had
to
get
his
own
restraining
order
because
of
the
public
threats
by
these
appellants
and
the
public
threats
by
the
attorney
general
of
wisconsin
and
district
attorney
that
they
might
not
mind
the
orders
of
the
federal
district
court.
but
those
points
have
nothing
to
do
with
his
professional
competency.
so
there
is
no
medical
emergency
in
the
picture
to
require
such
a
drastic
fast
movement
and
i
think
that
those
factors
are
extremely
important
towards
--
in
determining
when
a
due
process
allows
faster
activity.
certainly,
one
of
the
factors
would
be
whether
there
is
an
urgent
situation.
in
fact,
the
suggestion
for
mootness
demonstrates
some
urgent
situations
which
the
board
felt
they
needed
relief
from
and
that
was
in
the
case
of
two
alcoholics
and
one
narcotic
actor
--
addict
doctor
and
for
them
they
just
want
it
to
suspend
their
license
even
though
they
were
a
hazard
to
the
community,
to
the
state
in
general
and
indicated
for
them
there
will
be
rehabilitation
available
because
they
would
not
see
provocation.
for
an
abortionist
in
the
scene
and
a
situation
who
may
have
used
or
allegedly
use
the
wrong
name
on
occasion
or
sign
to
list
under
wrong
name
or
use
the
doctor
unlicensed
to
wisconsin
or
engaged
in
a
fee
splitting
which
we
just
dispute
and
deny,
there
is
no
hope
for
rehabilitation
so
apparently
drug
addicts
and
alcoholics
get
greater
percentage
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no.
you
can
use
under
wisconsin
common
law,
i
believe
you
can
use
any
name
and
you
don't
have
to
achieve
a
formal
name
change.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
like
to
point
out
a
continuation
that
there
really
are
no
facts
in
dispute.
in
the
suggestion
of
mootness
at
page
12,
i
have
reprinted
the
brief
presented
by
these
appellants
to
the
trial
court
in
which
they
distinguished
larkin
and
make
the
flat
statement.
the
larkin
case
was
of
course
on
its
facts
unique
and
that
the
board
investigated
charges
and
then
proposed
to
hold
a
contested
hearing
on
those
charges
and
thus
we
have
the
total
combining
of
functions,
situation.
a
situation
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct
mr.
justice
white
and
they've
done
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
that
they've
already
done
that,
yes
they
had
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
under
the
statute
they
have
made
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions
of
law
prior
to
the
issuance
of
the
preliminary
injunction
which
resolved
each
and
every
fact
situation,
factual
matter
which
they
propose
to
and
submitted
that
to
the
district
attorney
and
then,
they
then
propose
to
hold
a
hearing
to
suspend
on
the
very
same
charges.
they
go
to
the
district
attorney
because
the
district
attorney
either
can
commenced
criminal
charges.
i
might
add
to
he's
decided
not
to
do
that
or
to
revoke.
revocation
proceedings
in
wisconsin
are
judicial
proceedings
prosecuted
by
the
district
attorney,
and
even
at
the
end
of
a
revocation
proceeding
the
trial
judge
does
not
have
to
revoke,
he
can
suspend
the
license.
so
the
result
--
the
only
punishment
that
might
ever
been
achieved
by
--
in
this
situation
might
be
the
proposed
suspension
by
the
board.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
but
it
was
stated
in
all
argument
to
the
three-
judge
court
but
i
assume
the
transfer
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--
on
the
criminal
case?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
the
district
attorney
stated
that
he
would
only
pursue
revocation
proceedings
and
they
haven't
proceeded
i
might
add
but
that
was
the
position
that
he
had
taken.
now,
this
does
not
then
imply
anything
with
respect
to
infringement
upon
the
apa
because
if
the
apa
had
been
involved
this
kind
of
situation
never
would
have
occurred.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no
he
is
just
--
he's
made
that
public
statement,
the
one
i
just
indicated
which
was
that
he
would
not
pursue
criminal
charges
but
would
only
pursue
revocation
proceedings.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
i
don't
know
of
any
subsequent
activity
with
respect
to
dr.
keenan
subsequent
to
the
supreme
courts
decisions
on
the
abortion
cases.
i
don't
know
whether
he's
been
investigated
or
not
though
there
were
substantial
activity
with
respect
to
this
board
despite
restraining
orders
entered
by
judge
doyle
in
the
western
district
of
wisconsin
and
even
after
restraining
orders
were
entered,
this
board
proposed
to
take
his
licensed
away
because
he
was
administering
abortions,
which
is
unprofessional
conduct
according
to
448.18.
now,
the
situation
as
far
as
this
is
concerned
with
this
kind
of
totality
of
integration
of
activities
there
is
no
way
to
justify
it.
this
does
not
involve
economic
regulation
like
the
ftc
or
the
scc.
there
is
no
urgency
in
this
situation
because
there's
no
assertion
that
he
is
a
bad
doctor.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
i
mean
the
agency
is
not
dealing
with
economic
regulation
in
the
same
manner
the
ftc
does
so
that
a
decision
or
a
mingling
or
some
mingling
within
their
area
of
expertise
might
be
allowable
under
due
process
because
we
are
talking
about
economic
regulation.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
economics
of
dr.
larkin's
right
to
make
a
living
but
not
in
the
same
sense
as
the
ftc
regulates
the
economy
or
the
charge
given
to
them
by
congress
and
therefore
that
the
due
process
might
allow
a
certain
amount
of
inter
mingling
with
respect
to
an
agency
like
that
which
is
not
the
situation
here.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
that
lease
and
all
of
those
situations
are
--
it
seems
to
say
that
dr.
larkin
was
not
a
known
person
and
that
he
was
a
fly
by
night
doctors
so
to
speak.
in
october
of
1971,
everybody
in
the
state
of
wisconsin
knew
about
dr.
larkin,
he
was
on
the
front
pages
of
the
paper
and
everybody
knew
where
his
clinic
was.
he
closed
down
because
he
thought
he
was
being
threatened
with
prosecution
despite
the
6013
decision.
in
december
of
1971,
we
commence
an
action
in
the
federal
court
for
restraining
order
against
mr.
mccann
the
district
attorney
and
the
attorney
general
and
received
a
restraining
order
in
december
of
1971.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that
i
don't
think
that's
their
charged,
their
charges
is
he
signed
a
list
under
a
different
name
and
that
is
a
man
signing
a
list
there
is
no
way
that
people
did
not
know
that
that
was
dr.
larkin's
clinic
and
we
talked
about
him
not
being
available
to
answer
for
civil
litigation,
everybody
knows
that
it
was
dr.
larkin's
clinic,
there
is
no
showing
or
statement
under
that
at
all.
they
might
add
that
448.02
(4)
does
not
prohibit
a
doctor
from
practicing
in
wisconsin
under
an
assumed
name
that
might
add
that.
it's
only
prohibits
that
in
any
instance
in
which
the
examining
board
after
hearing
finds
that
such
practicing
under
such
a
changed
name
operates
unfairly
computed
etcetera.
so,
it's
only
in
instances
after
board
action
this
is
--
and
that
section
was
added
in
after
because
statute
use
to
be
flat
prohibition
and
they
put
that
in
taking
away
the
flat
prohibition.
so
it's
not
illegal
in
wisconsin
and
so
they
really
come
under
or
try
to
bring
him
under
the
catch
all
engaging
in
conduct
unbecoming
a
person
license
to
practice
or
detrimental
to
the
best
interest
which
is
another
issue
in
the
case
which
we
haven't
brought
up
that
which
is
three-judge
court
mentioned
namely
that
that's
void
for
vagueness.
