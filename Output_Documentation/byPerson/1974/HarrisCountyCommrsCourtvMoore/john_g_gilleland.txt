mr.
john
g.
gilleland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
further
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
the
court
apparently
has
in
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
texas
law
can
solve
some
of
the
problems.
i
would
like
to
give
the
court
a
brief
history
of
the
prior
law,
prior
to
1965
when
2351
1/2
(c)
came
in
to
existence.
article
5,
section
18
which
is
the
state
constitutional
provision
governing
the
justice
of
the
peace
and
constables
and
commissioners
was
adapted
by
the
residents
of
state
of
texas
in
1876
and
that
constitution
is
still
in
effect.
in
1895,
we
had
a
definitive
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas
interpreting
article
5,
section
18
on
a
matter
of
redistricting
justice
of
the
peace
and
constables.
i
have
cited
the
case
in
my
brief,
your
honors
and
that
case
is
titled
rigsby
v.
dowlen,
of
course,
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
texas.
again
in
1922,
in
the
case
titled
william
v.
castleman,
the
supreme
court
further
interpreted
article
5,
section
18.
now,
both
of
these
cases,
both
by
highest
appellate
courts
in
the
state
of
texas
concluded
that
when
justice
of
the
peace
and
constable
precincts
are
redistricted,
when
the
old
precincts
seized
to
exist
and
the
new
order
becomes
effective
that
the
new
offices
come
into
existence
vacant.
now
then,
to
relieve
some
of
the
harsh
effects
of
the
supreme
court
decisions
interpreting
article
5,
section
18,
the
legislature
in
1965
passed
2351
1/2
(c).
one
problem
that
we
have
had
and
we
have
had
to
resort
to
the
federal
court
is
because
of
the
prior
rulings
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
texas,
if
we
were
to
attack
in
a
state
court
the
provisions
of
2351
1/2
(c)
which
we
would
have
necessity
have
to
do
because
that's
a
tool
that
was
used
by
the
county
in
removing
the
appellees
from
office.
assume
that
we
were
successful
in
our
attack
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
2351
1/2
(c)
before
a
texas
court,
the
supreme
court,
then
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
would
re-implement
the
decisions
of
williams
v.
castleman
and
the
rigsby
case
of
1895
and
their
interpretation
of
article
5,
section
18
leaving
the
appellees
in
a
worst
position
that
they
were
prior
to
challenging
2351
1/2
(c).
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
so,
that
is
the
main
problem.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
that
we
would
have
to
challenge
the
--
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
your
honor,
it
would
be
my
position
that
declaratory
judgment
that
we
sought
within
the
three-judge
panel
hearing
and
that
was
subsequently
issued
by
the
court
was
that
any
--
that
2351
1/2
(c)
was
facially
unconstitutional
and
of
course
it's
effect
was
to
remove
an
elected
official
from
office
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
it
states
specifically
that
any
act
or
this
particular
act
that
would
removed
an
elected
official
from
office.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
now,
would
you
repeat
your
question,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
your
honor,
i
would
probably
agree
with
the
court
that
it
would
and
surely
have
gone
further
in
this
decision.
i
believe
that
that
matter
was
attacked
in
the
lower
court
but
the
three-judge
panel
did
not
address
itself
to
all
of
the
issues
that
were
raised
at
that
level
and
they
in
fact
concluded
on
two
particular
issues
with
reference
to
equal
protection
and
due
process
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
one
being
that
the
legislative
classification
where
you
have
one
officer
who
stays
in
office
simply
because
of
where
he
lives
after
redistricting
and
another
is
removed
simply
because
of
where
he
lives
after
redistricting,
that
that
act
in
itself
is
invidious
and
discriminatory.
and
their
second
holding
would
be
that
the
due
process
clause
guarantees
the
right
to
vote,
that
the
right
to
vote
is
a
fundamental
right
and
that
the
act
which
would
cut
short
or
abridge
the
right
of
the
voter
by
cutting
short
the
term
of
the
office
of
the
elected
official
violate
the
due
process.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
i
see
what
the
court,
yes
sir,
just
carrying
it
one
step
further
in
reasoning,
it
would
even
though
it
wasn't
specifically
set
out
in
the
court's
order.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
yes,
sir.
i
don't
recall
a
specific
order
except
i
believe
it
said
that
article
2351
1/2
(c)
was
facially
unconstitutional
and
that
they
were
enjoined
insofar
as
removing
these
--
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
maybe
i'm
not.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
or
page
40
of
appellees
brief,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
they
enjoined
the
--
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
under
the
terms
of
2351
1/2
(c)
--
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
your
honor,
if
i
may
carry
that
argument
one
point
further
on
the
matter
of
redistricting
we
are
not
--
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
no
sir.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
yes,
it
wasn't
(voice
overlap),
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
it
certainly
does,
your
honor
and
it
would
be
my
contention
should
we
seek
to
hold
someone
in
contempt
and
be
by
virtue
of
the
order
and
not
the
opinion
but
the
position
of
the
appellees
is
not
--
we
do
not
seek.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
now,
as
far
as
i
know
judge
singleton
who
was
the
presiding
judge
of
the
three-judge
panel
from
the
southern
district.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
sir?
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
no,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
no,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
yes,
your
honor,
i'm
in
agreement.
i
think
that
i
was
quoting
the
opinion
rather
than
the
order
a
moment
ago
but
for
the
court's
consideration,
we
are
not
challenging
the
redistricting
as
such.
we
would
be
the
first
to
admit
or
stipulate
that
redistricting
is
needed.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
yes
sir
but
because
the
effect
of
that
order
is
to
remove
elected
officials
from
office
part
of
--
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
in
that
particular
redistricting,
your
honor,
but
under
article
5,
section
18,
the
commissioners
court
of
harris
county,
texas
would
still
have
the
authority
to
redistrict
pursuant
to
any
instructions
that
they
may
have.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
with
reference
to
county
officers,
sir?
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
yes,
sir.
as
far
as
i
know
under
texas
law
including
the
statement
mr.
landry
made
in
court,
there
is
no
requirement
that
an
elected
official
reside
in
a
precinct
in
which
he
is
elected.
the
only
requirement
is
that
the
election
code
requires
that
you
be
there
to
be
elected.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
your
honor,
that
would
be
an
inconsistency
between
2351
1/2
(c)
and
across
the
--
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
no,
sir.
thank
you
for
the
opportunity
for
appearing.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
our
election
deadline
was
on
february
the
4th,
the
day
that
justice
powell
entered
his
order
and
the
boundaries
as
established
by
the
redistricting
order
of
the
court
were
permitted
to
carry
through
in
our
democratic
and
republican
primaries
and
consequently
we
have
now
officials
who
have
been
elected
at
the
general
election
as
of
last
tuesday
from
the
new
boundaries.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
was
saved.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
but
the
effect
of
this
staying
order
removed
my
officials
again
from
office
who
took
office
on
the
first
and
they
were
back
out
on
the
fourth.
right,
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
we
hope
we
do
that
question
hasn't
--
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
we
did
assert
one,
your
honor
but
it
has
been
denied
by
the
county.
we
met
the
man
on
several
occasions
for
--
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
no
sir.
it
has
not
been
asserted,
it
is
on
file,
a
motion
is
on
file
but
the
court
has
not
ruled
yet
as
to
whether
or
not
it
will
hear
the
issue
of
damages
before
a
three-judge
panel.
we
expect
the
court
to
address
itself
for
that
question
in
the
near
future.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
gilleland
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
