justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
that
the
three-judge
court
as
to
the
voter's
claim
in
effect
said
their
vote
was
frustrated
by
the
application
of
the
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
what
is
that.
perhaps
i
should
ask
the
other
side
but
would
that
mean
that
for
example,
suppose
the
legislate
–
there
was
a
position
and
someone
was
elected
to
it
in
a
legislature
of
policy
decision,
the
voters
again
would
be
frustrated,
would
they?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
this
is
no
different
in
terms
of
the
voters.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
or
are
you
suggesting
that
perhaps
as
to
the
justices
of
the
peace.
i
don't
know
whether
that
would
that
apply
to
the
constable.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
justice
blackmun
asked
you
before
lunch
whether
one
or
two
of
the
terms
or
one
of
these
may
expire
december
31,
are
they
eligible
for
re-election?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
did
he
win?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
mean
you
asked
that
the
redistricting
be
set
aside?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that
but
it's
all
damages.
you
didn't
ask
that
they
be
required
to
redo
this
plan
on
a
one
man,
one
vote
basis,
did
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
you
ask
for
that
remedy?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
your
clients
have
only
been
new
clients
for
only
two
in
number
jp's.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
they
both
lived
in
the
redistricted
four
and
you
had
another
client,
a
single
client
who
was
a
constable
and
he
lived
in
the
redistricting
four,
you
wouldn't
be
here,
would
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no,
no,
no.
those
who
are
you
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
if
that
were
the
case,
you
would
not
have
been
seeking
a
redistricting,
a
redoing
of
the
redistricting
plan,
would
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
have
used
the
term
commissioners
court
two
or
three
times,
is
this
an
actual
court
or
is
it
something
in
the
southern
sense
or
the
new
england
sense,
it's
different
for
a
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
who's
after
the
order
of
the
petitioner?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
not
counsel?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
not
counsel?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
didn't
ask
to
submit
an
order?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
incidentally,
may
i
ask
if
your
colleague
argued
the
inconsistency
between
section
24
of
your
state
constitution,
that's
the
removal
section?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
section
18
in
those
earlier
texas
supreme
court
decisions
proposition
was
--
that
supposed
the
inconsistencies
argued
in
deciding
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
county
officers
being
concluding
justices
of
the
peace?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
haven't
made
myself
clear,
section
24
as
i
understood
your
colleague,
he
argues
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
that
that's
the
only
way
you
can
remove
a
justice
of
the
peace
from
office.
in
other
words,
the
cause
shown,
being
set
forth
in
writing
and
the
finding
of
truth
by
the
jury.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
will
be
also
an
inconsistency
between,
would
it
not,
section
24
and
section
18,
independently
of
the
statute?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
wouldn't
it,
well,
what
i'm
asking
is
in
those
early
supreme
court
decisions,
have
they
ever
addressed,
had
alleged
inconsistency?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
any
event
you
didn't
go
to
the
court
and
said,
“look,
your
opinion
now
was
much
narrower
than
the
order.”
