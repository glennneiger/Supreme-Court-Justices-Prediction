justice
potter
stewart
how
large
was
that
committee?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
not
satisfy
the
voter's
claim
in
this
case,
would
it?
the
voters
are
also
--
this
case
also
has
its
parties'
voters
who
claim
that
they
voted
to
have
these
people
as
their
justice
of
the
peace,
for
them,
for
that
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
just
keeping
this
people
on
office
and
giving
them
their
pay
and
even
allowing
them
to
sit
in
the
new
precincts
5,
6
and
7
would
not
satisfy
the
voter's
claim,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
while
i
have
you
interrupted
mr.
landry.
looking
again,
i
just
want
to
see
how
the
statute
operates.
suppose
on
the
redistricting,
there
is
a
district
in
which
none
of
the
former
jp's
or
constables
leave,
then
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
and
where
you
have
as
you
do
as
i
understand
in
the
redistrict
at
four
and
you
have
places
only
for
two
jp's
and
one
constable?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
for,
you
have
actually
resident
there.
how
many
jp's?
justice
potter
stewart
and
two
constables.
now,
do
the
resident
jp's,
two
resident
jp's
they
lose
out,
do
they?
everyone
loses
out?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
mean.
so
none
of
the
â€“
it
would
only
be
if
you
had
two
jp's
and
one
constable
living
in
the
district
after
the
redistricting
that
this
problem
would
not
arise.
justice
potter
stewart
then
i
correctly
read
that
the
three-judge
court,
do
i,
by
saying
that
the
reason
there's
an
invidious
discrimination
here
is
between
no
situations.
justice
potter
stewart
where
you
have
all
the
three
places
to
fill
and
we
have
only
three
people
there,
they
get
the
jobs
whereas
if
you
have
three
places
to
fill
and
five
people
in
the
district,
nobody
gets
the
jobs.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
incidentally,
are
justices
of
the
peace,
judicial
officers
under
texas
law?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
you
know
that
we
have
not
applied
the
reynolds
v.
sims
principles
to
election
of
judicial
officers.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
states
it's
generally
called
the
county
commissioners,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
texas
and
in
missouri
and
maybe
some
other
states
call
them
the
county
court.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
attorney
general
say,
if
that
opinion
of
the
attorney
generals
had
turned
out
to
be
the
law
of
texas
then
you
wouldn't
have
the
same
lawsuit
you
have
now
at
all,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
suggests
that
the
district
court
should
have
at
least
abstained
to
find
out
what
the
law
of
texas
is.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
but
the
district
court
issued
a
decree
on
the
hypothesis
of
texas
law
provided
for
one
thing
and
you
have
now
just
told
us
that
that's
far
from
clear.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
any
federal
court
can
decide
a
case
if
the
state
law
is
unclear?
justice
potter
stewart
the
tenure
of
the
officeholders
not
the
law.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
order
of
the
court
did
was
not
to
keep
these
people
in
office
simply
but
to
absolutely
enjoin
the
redistricting,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
didn't
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
didn't
that
was
much
broader.
it
said
the
order
of
the
commissioners
court
of
harris
county,
texas
of
june
28,
1973
and
that
was
the
redistricting
order.
in
other
words,
the
redistricting
order
complained
of
is
therefore
permanently
enjoined.
justice
potter
stewart
page
35
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
allow
any
redistricting
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
well
it
just
didn't
allow
any
redistricting?
justice
potter
stewart
any
redistricting
that
would
result
presumably
in
the
change
of
a
residence
of
a
magistrate
or
a
commissioner
or
a
jp.
justice
potter
stewart
the
order
says
so.
justice
potter
stewart
this
court
speaks
through
its
order.
this
order
was
entered
i
suppose,
wasn't
it.
this
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
on
page
35,
beginning
on
page
34?
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
speaks
through
its
order,
i
suppose
in
texas
as
it
does
in
most
places.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see,
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
the
trouble
with
that
mr.
landry
according
to
your
brothers
is
that
there
is
no
prompt
way
for
getting
a
resolution
or
construction
in
the
texas
courts,
as
your
harris
county
courts
are
terribly
behind
and
impeded.
there
is
no
provision
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
we
heard
all
this
as
you
did
from
your
brothers
today
do
you
differ
with
them?
justice
potter
stewart
he
represented
us
professionally
that
this
would
be
a
very
long
procedure.
