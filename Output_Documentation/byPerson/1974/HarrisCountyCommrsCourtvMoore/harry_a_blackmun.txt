incidentally,
these
are
staggered
terms,
are
they
not?

they're
staggered
terms,
are
they
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
some
of
them
expire
in
any
event
on
december
31
of
this
year?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
will
the
case
as
to
them
possibly
become
moot
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
new
appointees
have
qualified
and
served,
have
they,
and
been
paid?
justice
harry
a.

mr.
edward
j.
landry,
do
you
think
the
real
problem
here
is
that
these
people
were
not
allowed
to
fill
out
their
terms,
serve
out
their
terms?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
that
hadn't
been
done,
do
you
think
you
would
have
had
no
lawsuit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
should
ask
the
other
side
but
how
do
you
explain
the
difference
between
this
statute
and
the
one
that
concerns
the
commissioners
as
such
which
specifically
as
i
recall
it
permits
them
to
serve
out
the
term?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
is
that
definitively
determined
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
why
in
massachusetts
it's
referred
to
as
the
supreme
judicial
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
certainly
inconsistent
with
the
concluding
paragraph
of
the
opinion,
is
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
order
does
except
for
the
size.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
that
if
we
affirm
then
that
redistricting
goes
out
the
window,
doesn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
landry,
a
number
of
states
now
have
had
statutes
which
permit
certification
from
the
federal
court
to
the
highest
court
of
state
for
the
disposition
of
a
question
of
state
law.
does
texas
have
such
a
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
uniform
statute
on
the
subject
matter.
