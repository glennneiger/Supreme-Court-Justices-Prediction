justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
have
just
thought
of
-–
you
haven't
run
in
to
any
case
of
applying
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
three-judge
court
mean
by
a
convenient
redistricting?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
are
they
called
--
does
it
have
some
special
meaning
of
the
convenience?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
is
convenient?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
federal
constitutional
significance
do
you
think
this
disparity
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
cases
here
would
indicate
that
this
so-called
malapportionment
of
the
jp
districts
would
raise
a
federal
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
actually
decide
litigated
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
told
us
that
the
attorney
general
at
the
state
of
texas
told
us
that
it
meant
something
quite
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
attorney
general's
opinion
wouldn't
reach
--
wouldn't
solve
the
voter's
call?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
the
same
result,
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
case
if
the
three-judge
court
holds
exactly
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
they
–
if
it
is
that
1965
legislation
is
unconstitutional?
aren't
you
glad
that
where
you
were
to
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
all
the
offices
were
vacated?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
wasn't
any
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
the
district
court's
order
was
saved
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
had
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
asserted
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
came
out
first,
the
opinion
of
the
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap),
mr.
justice
powell.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
opinion
is
followed
there
and
do
you
think
that
an
effect
to
modifying
the
order
or
--
