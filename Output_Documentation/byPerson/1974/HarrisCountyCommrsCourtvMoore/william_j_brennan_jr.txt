and
the
result
if
that
were
so,
mr.
landry
would
be
what
for
these
petitioners?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
three-judge
court
must
have
held
that
there
was
a
federal
right
of
these
voters
above.
some
constitutionally
--
federal
constitutionally
protected
right
of
theirs
to
vote
for
state
officers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
what,
well
excuse
me,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
this
clear.
i
thought
all
you
were
after
was
to
get
these
appellees'
jobs
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
certainly,
it's
what
the
appendix
says,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
only
insofar
as
defendant's
order
of
january
30
undertakes
to
point
other
persons.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
landry,
did
you
make
any
point
before
the
three-judge
court
seeming
broader
order
than
the
last
paragraph
of
the
opinion
indicated
would
be
under?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
you
weren't
involved
in
the
defense
of
that
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
reading
this
order,
it's
broader
than
the
opinion
indicated
would
be
given
to
the
plaintiffs,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
didn't
argue
that
proposal
is
broader
than
what
you
said
in
the
appeal
you
were
going
--
