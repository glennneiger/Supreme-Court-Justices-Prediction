mr.
edward
j.
landry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
decision
of
the
southern
district
of
texas
declaring
first
a
texas
statute
article
2351
1/2
(c)
unconstitutional
and
enjoining
so
much
of
a
commissioner's
court
redistricting
order
which
had
the
necessary
effect
under
the
statute
of
terminating
the
terms
of
office
of
five
officeholders.
three
of
whom
were
justices
of
the
peace
and
two
constables.
the
facts
of
the
case
briefly
are
as
follows:
on
march
12,
1973
the
commissioners
court
of
harris
county
appointed
a
committee
of
nine
persons
to
study
the
redistricting
of
both
the
county's
commissioner
precincts
as
well
as
its
justice
of
the
peace
precincts.
that
committee
consisted
of
a
county
commissioner
who
himself
had
served
for
ten
years
in
the
state
legislature
and
on
the
committee
in
the
legislature
for
the
redistricting
measures
which
had
been
taken
by
the
texas
legislature
during
his
tenure
in
office.
it
also
includes
a
justice
of
the
peace,
a
constable,
a
republican
or
a
member
of
the
republican
party
in
the
county,
a
member
of
the
democratic
party
in
the
county,
a
negro,
a
mexican-american
and
a
woman
as
well
as
another
or
as
well
a
university
of
houston
professor
who
had
some
expertise
in
redistricting
and
i
might
also
add
that
the
county
commissioner
was
and
is
a
professor
at
the
university
of
st.
thomas
in
houston
and
heads
the
political
science
department.
after
more
than
two
months
of
study
of
the
necessity
for
redistricting
in
harris
county,
that
committee
recommended
to
the
commissioners
court
a
redistricting
plan
for
the
commissioners
court
which
the
commissioners
court
implemented
and
it
met
the
strict
requirements
of
avery.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
a
committee
of
nine,
your
honor.
two
weeks
after
that
it
recommended
a
redistricting
plan
for
the
justices
of
the
peace
precinct
and
the
commissioners
court
shortly
thereafter
with
a
plan
somewhat
different
from
the
plan
recommended
by
the
committee
and
it
was
primarily
authored
by
the
commissioner
on
the
commissioners
court
and
who
had
served
on
the
committee,
implemented
the
plan
of
redistricting
of
the
justice
of
the
peace
precincts.
now,
the
justice
of
the
peace
precincts
prior
to
the
redistricting
plan
being
put
into
effect
had
two
justices
in
one
precinct
and
one
justice
in
each
of
the
other
precincts.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
yes,
your
honor,
they
are.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
and
some
on
december
31
of
1976,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
it
would
not
become
moot
as
to
the
recovery
of
the
emoluments
of
the
office
from
the
time
that
they
were
ousted
from
office
pursuant
to
the
redistricting
to
the
end
of
the
term
of
the
office.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
yes,
your
honor.
they
have.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
thank
you.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
commissioners
court's
order
of
redistricting
again
was
passed
by
that
court
on
june
28th,
1973
to
become
effective
july
1,
1973.
in
many
reasons
stated
by
the
three
commissioners
who
formed
the
three-nine
majority
in
effecting
this
redistricting
order
are
detailed
at
page
5
of
the
appellant's
brief
and
of
course
the
primary
reason
for
the
redistricting
in
question
was
the
gross
disparities
existing
between
various
precincts
as
they
existed
prior
to
the
redistricting
action
in
question
and
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
exhibits
e
and
f
of
the
appellant's
brief
which
sets
out
on
page
58,
the
precinct
met
as
it
existed
before
the
redistricting
in
question
and
on
page
59,
the
redistricting
or
redistricted
precincts
after
the
order
was
passed.
the
court
will
know
that
in
the
precincts
4,
5,
6
and
7
there
were
population
counts
of
81,000,
6,900,
8,800,
11,976
for
4,
5,
6,
and
7.
as
a
result
of
the
redistricting
and
the
attempt
by
the
commissioners
to
make
the
precincts
more
reasonably
apportioned
of
necessity
required
the
combining
of
these
precincts
to
make
up
one
precinct
and
that
is
what
happened
in
coming
up
with
new
precinct
four
as
the
court
will
note
on
the
opposite
page,
page
59
and
there
would
be
no
problem
except
that
article
2351
1/2
(c)
which
is
the
statute
in
question
here
provides
that
following
a
redistricting
where
you
have
such
a
situation
just
as
this,
where
as
a
result
of
combining
precincts
to
form
one
precinct
and
you
have
an
excess
number
or
surplusage
of
either
jp's
or
constables
for
the
limited
number
of
positions
in
the
new
precinct
and
in
this
case
we
had
only
two
authorized
jp's
and
one
constable.
we
ended
up
as
a
result
of
necessarily
combining
these
various
precincts
to
come
up
with
a
more
reasonably
apportioned
precinct,
three
justices
of
the
peace
to
fill
the
two
justice
positions
and
two
constables
to
fill
the
one
constable
position.
as
a
result
of
that,
the
commissioners
court
under
the
statute
article
2355,
first
2351
1/2
(c)
declares
these
positions
in
the
new
precinct
vacant
as
a
result
of
that
factual
situation
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the
commissioners
court
is
authorized
to
fill
those
vacancies
which
it
proceeded
to
do.
it
appointed
one
of
the
three
justices
of
the
peace
of
the
former
precincts
to
fill
the
one
of
the
two
new
positions
and
one
of
the
constables
to
fill
the
one
constable
position.
it
reached
outside
of
the
area
of
the
former
constables
or
justices
of
the
peace
to
fill
the
other
justice
position
and
it
chose
a
lawyer
to
do
that
with.
the
justice
of
the
peace
of
the
former
precinct
that
it
chose
to
fill
the
other
position
was
one
with
some
16-1/2
year
service
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
of
the
former
precinct.
now,
as
a
result
of
the
effect
of
the
statute
and
the
effect
of
these
facts
that
meant
that
these
five
officeholders,
the
appellees
in
this
case
had
their
terms
of
office
terminated.
the
two
constables
in
the
course,
had
some
2-1/2
years
to
run
until
december
31,
1976
and
the
three
justices
of
the
peace
had
until
december
31
of
this
year
and
which
to
fill
out
their
terms
of
office.
they,
as
a
result,
of
this
action
of
redistricting
and
the
effect
of
2351
1/2
(c)
on
the
day
that
the
redistricting
order
was
passed
filed
suit
in
state
district
court
in
harris
county,
texas
and
on
the
following
day
i
would
amend
that
one
of
the
five
individual
officers
filed
a
suit
and
that
was
appellee
moore.
on
the
following
day,
the
district
court
denied
a
temporary
injunction
and
without
further
prosecuting
their
remedy
in
the
state
courts,
they
then
filed
suit
in
the
federal
court
on
july
20th
of
1973
and
--
mr.
edward
j.
landry
i
think
that
is
solely
their
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
i
think
not
whatever
but
of
course,
i
cannot.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
i
think
that
contention
was
answered,
your
honor
in
the
case
of
whitmarsh
against
buckley
which
of
course
you
set
out
in
our
brief.
in
whitmarsh
against
buckley,
the
court
explained
in
distinguishing
the
right
of
a
commissioner
to
continue
to
serve
after
a
redistricting
which
places
his
residence
outside
of
the
precinct
from
which
he
was
elected
and
a
situation
where
there
were
school
district
trustees
who
by
reason
of
de-annexation
had
been
placed
outside
of
the
school
district.
they
court
of
civil
appeals
in
that
case
declared
that
there
was
a
valid
distinction.
commissioners
are
not
precinct
officers.
they
are
not
elected
from
the
precinct
in
which
they
are
to
reside
to
represent
only
the
people
who
reside
in
that
precinct.
they
are
elected
to
represent
the
people
of
the
entire
county
whereas
in
this
case
the
constable
and
the
two
justices
of
the
peace
of
each
precinct
are
elected
to
represent
only
the
people
in
the
particular
precinct
in
which
they
are
elected
to
serve.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
not
with
respect
to
the
difference
between
justices
of
the
peace
and
constables
as
opposed
to
county
commissioners,
your
honor
and
of
course
that
is
one
of
the
supporting
basis
upon
which
we
feel
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
in
this
particular
case
to
give
the
state
courts,
the
opportunity
to
decide
that
very
question
because
one
of
the
major
contentions
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
is
that
they
are
truly
county
officers
under
the
state
constitutional
provision
article
16,
section
14
and
that
as
a
result
of
being
classed
as
county
officers
whose
residence
need
only
be
within
the
county
as
opposed
to
residence
within
a
precinct
then
under
2351
1/2
they
should
not
be
confined
to
residency
within
the
precinct
and
2351
1/2
would
be
invalid
or
unconstitutional
under
state
constitutional
article
16,
section
14.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
they
would
be
able
to
stay
in
office,
your
honor.
they
would
--
i
would
invite
the
court
to
look
at
the
precinct
map
again.
we
had
justices
of
the
peace
of
precincts
5,
6,
and
7
who
were
in
effect
ousted
from
office
by
effect
the
statute.
now,
those
individuals
would
simply
go
to
the
new
precincts
of
those
same
numbers
on
the
opposite
page
and
they
would
then
be
able
to
fill
out
their
terms
of
office
but
that
question
has
never
been
answered
by
the
state
court.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
that
is
one
of
the
basis
on
which
the
district
court
found
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional,
your
honor
but
we
would
submit
--
mr.
edward
j.
landry
no,
it
would
not
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
if
the
district
court's
view
is
correct
with
regard
to
that
line
of
reasoning
you
could
never
have
a
redistricting
which
changed
the
line
to
put
a
resident
or
citizen
outside
of
the
precinct
of
that
in
which
he
elected
an
officer.
(voice
overlap)
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
i
believe
that
that
is
what
the
three-judge
court
said,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
well,
in
that
case,
i
suppose
the
voters
would
be
frustrated
but
we
submit
that
the
state
definitely
has
that
power
within
its
own
internal
political
structure.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
that's
correct.
there
is
no
contractual
relationship
between
the
voters
and
the
officer
or
as
far
as
that
goes
between
the
officer
and
the
state.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
well,
i
think
what
the
court
did.
i
think
the
court
said
that
the
rights
of
the
voters
and
the
officers
in
question
were
intertwined
and
any
jocking
of
the
rights
of
the
officers
was
a
jocking
of
the
rights
of
the
voters.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
well,
under
the
statute
your
honor.
that
particular
precinct
has
a
vacancy
or
vacancies
as
to
those
positions
and
the
commissioners
court
then
proceeds
to
appoint.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
that
is
correct.
as
all
of
these
new
precincts
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
three
justices
of
the
peace
and
two
constables.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
no,
the
three
justices
of
the
peace,
your
honor
for
the
two
positions
authorized
obviously
they
all
three
cannot
fill
two
positions.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
so,
the
statute
says
that
those
three
--
two
positions
are
to
be
considered
vacated.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
that's
correct.
the
statute
would
then
require
these
two
jp's
or
entitle
two
jp's
to
fill
out
their
terms
of
office
and
would
entitle
the
of
course
the
constable
to
fill
out
his
office.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
district
court
held
that
because
of
this
differing
treatment
that
that
was
invidious
discrimination
and
we
submit
that
the
state
does
in
fact
have
a
compelling
state
interest
which
sustains
this
statute
and
this
difference
of
treatment
between
officers
in
one
precinct
and
officers
in
another.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
they
perform
judicial
duties,
yes
your
honor,
they
handled
trials.
they
have
jurisdiction
of
cases,
in
civil
cases
up
to
$200.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
your
honor,
i've
no
point
here,
frankly
saying
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
i
must
have
missed
that
case
entirely,
your
honor.
with
regard
--
mr.
edward
j.
landry
no,
i
have
not.
we
have
not
and
we
submit
that
the
reynolds
against
sims
rule
of
the
one
man,
one
vote
of
course
simply
has
no
application
in
this
kind
of
a
precinct
or
this
kind
of
a
district.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
well,
of
course,
constables
have
jurisdiction
outside
of
their
precinct.
they
can
serve
papers
outside
of
their
precinct
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
by
law,
they
are
required
to
reside
within
their
precinct
as
are
the
justices
of
the
peace.
but
we
submit
that
the
reason
for
the
compelling
state
interest
which
would
sustain
this
kind
of
a
statute
and
sustain
the
differing
kind
of
treatment
between
officers
of
the
same
class
is
texas'
requirement
of
residency
within
the
precinct
and
that
is
the
thing
that
distinguishes,
of
course,
the
different
treatment
between
justices
of
the
peace
and
constables
on
the
one
hand
and
county
commissioners
on
the
other
following
a
redistricting
of
the
precincts.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
they
were
eligible
for
the
general
election
this
year,
your
honor.
in
fact,
one
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
judge
zaboroski
ran
this
year
after
having
been
ousted
as
a
result
of
the
redistricting.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
no,
sir
he
did
not.
now,
the
three
justices
of
the
peace
of
course,
their
terms
end
december
31
of
this
year.
the
two
constables
have
two
more
years
following
december
31
of
this
year.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
well,
that
is
the
term
set
out
in
the
constitutional
article
5,
--
state
constitutional
article
5,
section
18
which
is
the
authority,
your
honor,
for
the
redistricting
by
a
commissioners
court
of
its
county's
justice
precincts.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
well,
the
phrase
of
course
for
the
convenience
of
the
people
and,
i
think
probably,
this
court
went
into
great
study
and
great
deliberation
of
that
phrase
in
avery
against
midland
county
and
of
course
in
avery
against
midland
county
--
mr.
edward
j.
landry
well,
convenience
of
course,
in
terms
of
justice
of
the
peace
precincts,
now
that
this
court
has
decided
that
one
vote,
--
one
man,
one
vote
applies
to
commissioners
court.
convenience
of
the
people
would
include
primarily,
of
course,
population,
and
there's
no
question
but
that
there
was
a
compelling
need
to
redistrict
in
this
case
in
light
of
the
gross
disparities
in
population
of
the
old
precincts.
in
addition
to
that,
there
would
be
the
work
load
or
the
amount
of
services
required
by
a
particular
area.
for
instance,
in
one
precinct
there
may
well
be
a
greater
crime
rate
which
would
require
greater
work
load
of
the
constable
as
well
as
the
two
justices
of
the
peace.
there
is
of
course
the
geography,
the
matter
of
square
mileage.
there
are
any
number
of
factors
which
the
commissioners
court
would
consider
in
arriving
at
the
shape
and
the
size
of
the
new
precincts
of
these
kind
of
new
precincts.
but
in
addition
to
intending
that
the
state
does
indeed
have
a
compelling
state
interest
to
sustain
the
particular
statute
in
question
that
is
the
precinct
residency
requirement
of
these
various
offices
and
we
of
course
cited
and
quoted
from
in
our
brief
the
case
of
hadnott
against
amos,
an
alabama
case
involving
circuit
judges
of
that
state
which
this
court
affirmed.
in
addition
to
that
compelling
interest,
we
would
submit
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
in
this
particular
case
for
the
reason
that
there
are
state
constitutional
questions,
state
constitutional
considerations
which
if
decided
by
the
texas
supreme
court
would
give
all
of
the
--
in
appellees'
favor
would
avoid
the
federal
constitutional
question.
thank
you.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
just
answer
some
of
the
contentions
made
by
counsel
for
the
appellees.
first,
with
respect
to
mr.
friloux's
charge
that
this
redistricting
was
in
bottomed
on
racial
discrimination
basis,
i
would
submit
that
that
is
not
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
white
against
regester
in
which
the
court
upheld
the
ruling
of
the
district
court's
striking
down
multi-member
districts
in
texas
on
the
ground
that
they
suppressed
minority
participation
in
the
political
arena.
in
this
particular
case,
the
commissioners
made
no
bones
about
the
aim
as
one
of
the
objectives
of
this
redistricting
to
promote
minority
participation
and
to
that
end
they
did
in
fact,
in
a
precinct
with
some
35%
latin-american
population
appoint
a
latin-american
constable
as
well
as
two
justices
of
the
peace
of
latin-american
extraction.
also,
with
regard
to
precinct
number
7
in
which
had
a
58.4%
black
population,
they
appointed
one
negro
constable
and
two
negro
justices
of
the
peace.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
objective
of
many
that
are
set
out
at
page
5
of
the
appellant's
brief
is
a
laudable
on
the
part
of
the
commissioners
court.
with
respect
to
mr.
friloux
and
mr.
gilleland's
contentions
that
article
5,
section
24
of
the
constitution
that
is
the
state
constitution
classifies
these
officers
as
county
officers.
that
may
well
be
true
but
in
the
whitmarsh
against
buckley
case
which
is
a
court
of
civil
appeals
case
no
written
history.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
there
the
court
classed
school
district
trustees
as
county
officers
and
yet
they
applied
article
105
of
the
election
code
to
say
that
they
were
confined
to
residency
within
the
school
district
which
was
an
area
less
in
size
than
the
county
as
a
whole
and
whether
or
not
these
individuals
or
county
officers
we
would
submit
is
not
a
question
for
this
court
to
decide.
it
is
a
question
truly
for
the
texas
courts
to
decide
as
to
whether
or
not
these
officers
or
county
officers
under
the
state
constitution
and
whether
or
not
they
should
be
treated
the
same
as
the
county
commissioners
in
section
b
of
the
statute.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
your
honor,
no,
we
did
not.
we,
of
course,
have
not
been
before
the
district
court
except
to
seek
a
stay
of
its
order.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
yes,
we
were
your
honor.
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
that's
correct
but
as
i've
said
in
answer
to
the
question
we've
only
been
before
the
courts
since
the
order
in
an
attempt
to
seek
a
stay.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
no,
we
did
not
your
honor
but
of
course,
we
argued
that
if
the
order
was
far
overrating
when
we
sought
the
stay
from
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
the
order
came
down
on
the
very
day
of
the
hearing.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
yes,
your
honor.
the
order
came
down
on
january
30th.
the
opinion
came
down
on
february
the
8th.
we
of
course,
have
discussed
at
great
length
the
seeming
disparity.
we
have
assumed
that
the
order
is
to
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
court's
opinion
and
therefore
if
the
order
is
much
tampered
by
the
opinion
of
course.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
well,
that's
just
our
hope,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
we
haven't
had
to,
your
honor
in
the
light
of
mr.
justice
powell's
stay
and
in
of
course
the
hope
that
this
court
will
provide
us
with
the
relief
that
we're
seeking.
i
would
just
close
out
with
the
following.
with
regard
to
article
2351
1/2
(c)
two
united
states
district
courts
have
now
abstained
from
deciding
questions
involving
the
construction
of
that
statute
all
be
at
both
at
for
section
a
of
the
statute.
the
attorney
general
of
texas
has
now
with
three
different
advisory
opinions
declared
either
section
a
or
section
c
unconstitutional
under
the
state
constitution.
one
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
has
actually
applied
the
statute.
the
statute
is
just
begging
for
a
definitive
construction
by
the
texas
supreme
court
and
we
would
submit
that
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case
would
be
for
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
remand
the
cause
to
that
court
with
instructions
to
abstain
from
deciding
the
case
on
the
ground
of
abstention.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
i
differed
very
greatly,
your
honor.
there
certainly
is
declaratory
judgment
provisions
in
the
texas
statutes.
i
don't
know
which
courts
that
my
adversary
counsel
--
mr.
edward
j.
landry
there
is
no
question
that
there
may
be
some
delay
but
it
is
not
unreasonable
delay.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
your
honor,
--
mr.
edward
j.
landry
i
simply
do
not
know
the
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
edward
j.
landry
i
have
not
given
it
any
thought
your
honor
but
i
would
certainly
think
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
would
have
that
kind
of
power.
