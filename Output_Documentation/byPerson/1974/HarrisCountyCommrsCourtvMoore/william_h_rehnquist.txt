justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
isn't
as
bad
at
it
was,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
--
you
didn't
complain
that
that
one
was
more
poorly
apportioned
than
it
is
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
one
of
the
grounds
of
your
actions
for
the
three-judge
district
court
was
malapportionment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
you
never
complained
of
the
even
more
poorly
apportioned
justice
districts
that
existed
before
the
commissioners
took
this
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
white
asked
you
a
moment
ago
what
cases
from
this
court
you
rely
on
to
raise
the
federal
question
as
to
the
districting
requirements,
what
federal
--
what
case
of
this
court
do
you
rely
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
say
there
is
the
federal
or
constitutional
malapportionment
claim
which
i
understand
you
are
asserting,
what
cases
of
this
court
you
rely
on
to
support
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
in
the
1965
act,
was
just
designed
to
ameliorate
part
of
the
consequences
of
those
texas
constitutional
decision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
wouldn't
the
three-judge
district
court
had
to
hold
the
texas
constitutional
provisions
invalid,
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
since
the
‘65
act
was
just
to
ameliorate
some
of
the
conceived
hardships
visited
by
the
earlier
texas
decisions
interpreting
the
texas
constitution.
if
the
three-judge
district
court
were
going
to
restore
your
people
to
office
wouldn't
it
had
to
hold
those
texas
constitutional
provisions
unconstitutional
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
then
the
due
process
theme
of
the
three-judge
district
court
would
hold
the
texas
constitutional
provisions
invalid
just
as
surely
as
it
would
the
‘65
legislative
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gilleland,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down.
about
what
is
going
on
in
harris
county
now
in
connection
with
this?
as
i
understand
it
the
three-judge
district
court
judgment
was
entered
january
30th
and
on
february
4,
1974,
justice
powell
granted
to
stay
and
the
full
court
--
our
full
court
declined
to
set
it
aside
on
february
19.
now,
has
anything
happened
to
carry
out
the
commissioners
court's
orders?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
think
that
if
you
win
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
the
complaint
in
the
federal
court
did
pray
for
that?
