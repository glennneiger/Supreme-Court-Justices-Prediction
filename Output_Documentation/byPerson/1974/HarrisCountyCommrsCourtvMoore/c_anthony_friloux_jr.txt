mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
just
state
one
short
comment
in
regard
to
the
totality
of
the
atmosphere
of
this
redistricting
order,
your
honors
and
then
get
very
specifically
holding
in
on
the
constitutional
question.
this
redistricting
order
which
took
place
by
three-two
vote
of
a
democrat
majority
of
three
democrats
on
the
commissioners
court
took
place
in
quite
an
unusual
set
of
circumstances.
there
was
a
committee
that
has
been
mentioned
by
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
who
had
supposedly
met
and
they
came
up
with
seven
or
eight
plans.
on
the
night
or
the
eve
of
the
date
in
which
this
order
was
passed,
commissioner
bass
by
himself
according
to
the
testimony
in
the
appendices
here
designed
a
new
plan
at
night,
did
not
inform
the
other
commissioners
of
it,
walked
into
the
court
and
presented
and
they
passed
it
3-2
to
go
into
effect
three
days
later.
i
represent
judge
zaboroski
who
was
only
the
republican
justice
of
the
peace
elected
at
that
time
in
harris
county
since
reconstruction
days.
in
our
pleadings,
when
we
decided
to
seek
the
forum
proper
to
the
relief
at
which
we
felt
we
were
entitled,
we
filed
suit
under
both
civil
rights
and
of
statutes
under
those
in
title
42,
1983,
1985,
and
title
28.
we
filed
also
for
the
dilution
in
the
abasement
of
the
vote
of
the
class
of
voters
within
the
respective
precincts
and
the
unequal
treatment
of
the
voters
in
the
same
class
and
particularly
for
political
discrimination
against
the
minority
party
in
the
county
habitually,
traditionally
and
till
date
controlled
by
the
democrat
party
and
even
more
fundamentally
the
unusual
and
unbelievable
circumstance
at
this
time
and
space
and
at
this
time
in
circumstance,
are
the
use
of
racial
discrimination
to
create
enclaves
within
the
city
which
is
an
admission
in
the
deposition
testimony
in
the
appendices
that
they
were
setting
up
these
racial
enclaves
to
assure
that
certain
members
of
certain
and
only
certain
ethnic
and
racial
groups
would
be
able
to
be
elected
at
office
and
to
succeed
themselves
in
office
and
of
course
then
malapportionment.
the
precincts
were
not,
in
fact,
brought
back
into
line
with
any
serious
attempt
that
the
avery
rule
of
“one
man,
one
vote”
and
now
the
disparity
is
still
is
bad
as
it
was.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
it
wasn't
as
bad
but
it's
still
substantially
out
of
the
line
but
i
think
our
concept
as
it
are
evolving
today,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
i
don't
understand
the
question.
we
didn't
complain?
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
yes.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
your
honor,
when
i
was
employed
in
this
case
i
immediately
complained
about
as
it
now
exists
because
it
still
i
think
significantly
out
of
line
with
the
intent
of
the
courts'
decisions
in
all
of
the
cases
requisite
to
apportionment.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
i
sure
did,
your
honor.
we
asked
that
the
redistricting
be
set
aside
on
the
basis
that
the
statute
was
facially
and
in
its
application
unconstitutional.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
we're
asking
for
damages,
for
violation
of
civil
rights,
substantial
damages.
we're
asking
for
damages
based
on
the
political
discrimination
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
our
petition
is
quite
extensive.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
we've
raised
it
that
this
is
unconstitutional
because
--
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
no,
i
didn't
ask
for
the
remedy
that
with
the
court
issue,
an
order
ordering
redistricting.
i
think
that
should
be
left
to
the
commissioners
court
to
do
it
as
historically
has
been
done,
your
honor.
now,
in
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
moot
--
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
it's
a
dilution
of
the
vote
for
one
thing,
your
honor
of
voters
in
the
same
class.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
perhaps
i
can
answer
it
this
way.
first,
the
state
has
no
obligation
whatever
upon
itself
to
determine
that
these
offices
be
done
by
election.
they
have
an
absolute
right
to
have
them
appointed
or
any
manner
in
which
they
presume
as
i
understand
the
law.
in
this
case,
having
assumed
and
given
to
the
citizens
of
the
state,
the
right
to
select
these
people
by
election
even
though
they
had
an
option
not
to
do
so.
at
that
point,
the
fourteenth
amendment
protection
would
come
into
being
and
we
say
that
when
you
have
citizens
in
one
precinct
whose
vote
is
not
equally
effective,
whose
vote
is
diluted
then
you
have
the
fourteenth
amendment
coming
into
play.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
unless
some
other
one
who
was
thrown
out
in
employee
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
those
people
would
not
be
here.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
because
they
would
not
have
been
abused.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
that's
right
because
those
particular
people
would
have
not
complained
if
they
had
not
been
harmed
but
those
who
came
under
the
alternate
provisions
would
have
been
harmed
and
they
would
have
been
here
seeking
this
relief.
there's
no
way
you
can
take
this
statute
and
look
at
it
and
justify
the
fact
that
people
within
the
same
class
are
treated
differently
and
officeholders
within
the
same
class
are
treated
differently.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
you
mean
so
far
as
asking
them
to
redistrict,
your
honor?
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
we
did
not
ask
for
redistricting.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
i
think
the
same
avery
and
i
think
reynolds
both
your
honor
and
i
think
the
same
ruling
that
applied
to
commissioners
would
apply
here
once
the
fourteenth
amendment
attaches.
if
the
fourteenth
amendment
protections
exist,
so
that
in
truth
and
in
fact
the
right
to
vote
becomes
absolute
then
i
think
the
right
to
have
that
vote
counted
equally
follows
in
natural
course.
now,
there
have
been
no
decisions
on
this
level
as
far
as
i
can
determine
from
the
law.
the
court
has
ruled
definitively
on
the
commissioners
court.
now
we
are
in
the
subcomponent,
sub-political
component
of
the
state
and
the
county.
the
state
has
seen
fit
to
confer
upon
the
citizens
of
that
particular
subdivision,
the
right
to
vote
as
a
method
in
which
they
will
select
those
people
who
performed
these
particular
duties
whether
administrative,
judicial
or
legislative
on
that
level.
once
having
done
that
then
we
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
protections
come
in
and
when
they
come
in,
i
think
they
carry
inherently
with
them
under
these
decisions,
the
fact
that
they
should
be
counted
equally.
they
should
not
be
diluted.
they
should
not
be
abrogated
as
this
statute
does.
it
allows
those
who
vote
for
one
man
to
have
the
benefit
of
this
man
serving
in
office.
on
the
same
time
at
the
same
circumstance,
it
says
to
another
group
of
people,
we're
sorry
but
you
voted
for
this
man,
he
may
still
have
two
years
to
go
what
my
client
did
in
office
but
we're
not
going
to
give
you
your
choice.
we're
going
to
put
this
man
that
lived
in
the
next
precinct
who
you
never
have
a
choice
to
vote
for
in
your
precinct
and
just
absolutely
destroy
the
vote
in
that
case.
and
in
the
third
case
where
everybody
voted
for
them
and
then
that
they
still
relived
within
the
district,
all
three
of
them
were
there,
they
declared
everybody
vacant
and
then
appoint
three
new
people
who
they
did
in
this
case
most
of
these
appointments
were
political
appointees,
who
are
friends
of
this
majority
court.
now,
the
statute
and
i'd
liked
to
address
myself
to
the
statute
itself
because
really
the
basic
question
is
whether
the
statute
itself
within
its
own
provisions
sows,
has
the
seeds
of
its
own
destruction,
that
is
whether
the
provisions
of
the
statute
on
its
face
is
--
and
creates.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
they
performed
judicial
function.
they
are
county
officers
and
they
do
--
it's
never
been
defined
as
a
pure
judicial
office.
it's
not
a
court
of
record
but
they
do
judicial
duties
and
i
would
think
in
a
judicial
construction
of
it,
it
would
probably
be
determined
that
it
was
judicial
in
nature.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
insofar
as
judicial
office
is
being
covered,
in
regard
to
fourteenth
amendment
rights
your
honor.
i
think
the
fact
that
the
commissioners
court
which
is
a
court
would
provide
some
and
the
decisions
which
were
returned
in
that
case
would
provide
some
authority
for
it
now.
i
didn't
anticipate
this
question
and
i
can't
give
you
specific
decision
of
this
court
which
reaches
down
into
this
level
and
says
that
a
justice
of
the
peace
of
the
type
we
have
in
texas
is
covered
by
a
supreme
court
decision
which
says
that
this
must
be
so.
i
don't
think
it's
been
met
by
this
court
on
this
level
and
this
is
what
i
think
we
need
to
address
ourselves
to.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
well,
it's
called
the
commissioners
court.
it
sits
as
a
court.
its
decisions
are
appealable
in
a
court
manner
but
it
has
legislative
and
administrative
duties.
it's
a
hybrid,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
no,
sir
but
the
county
judge
himself
does
hear
cases
but
the
court
as
an
entity
makes
decisions.
it
does
not
sit
in
a
normal
litigation
type
circumstances
all
by
its
called
the
court
but
its
primary
duty
is
legislative
administrative
as
i
interpret
it.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
this
is
an
old
historical
term
that
has
been
used
in
its
--
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
right.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
have
a
very
limited
time
because
of
split
argument.
i
did
want
to
address
myself
to
one
of
the
first
questions
i
asked
as
to
my
client
and
several
others
as
to
whether
the
relief
sought
would
become
moot
and
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
texas
constitution
itself
article
5,
section
18
wherein
it
sets
out
the
absolute
authority
and
the
mandate
of
authority
to
the
commissioners
court
and
it
provides
in
each
precinct
there
should
be
one
elected
justice
of
the
peace
and
one
constable.
each
of
whom
shall
hold
this
office
for
a
four-year
period.
it
says
for
four
years
in
common
and
until
his
successor
shall
have
been
elected
and
qualified.
now,
in
regard
to
whether
or
not
this
becomes
moot,
if
this
statute
is
found
facially
unconstitutional
then
the
officeholders
unlawfully
removed
from
office
who
are
still
under
the
constitution
of
texas
itself
entitled
to
and/or
the
lawful
office
and
they
can
remain
in
that
position
until
the
county
commissioners
see
fit
either
to
fill
that
vacancy
or
to
provide
an
election
as
the
constitution
says
at
the
next
general
election,
so
its'
not
a
moot
question.
now,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
should
be
remanded
because
of
the
nature
of
the
office.
article
5,
section
24
is
definitive
in
my
judgment.
it
says
removal
of
county
officers,
in
other
words,
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
texas
at
its
inception
defined
who
were
county
officers
and
it
says
county
judges,
county
attorneys,
clerks
of
a
district
and
county
courts,
justice
of
the
peace,
constables
and
other
county
officers
including
justices
and
constables
may
be
removed
and
they
set
the
method
of
removal
and
nowhere
does
the
constitution
say
that
they
can
be
removed
by
any
other
body
for
any
other
purpose
than
the
constitutional
reasons.
and
what
we
have
here
with
the
statute
setting
by
legislative
edict,
additional
manners
of
removal.
it
also
sets
by
legislative
edict,
the
manner
in
which
the
justices
shall
be
left
in
office
or
taken
out
of
office,
none
of
which
conforms
to
the
removal
section
of
the
constitution
and
none
of
which
is
consistent
with
it
but
rather
in
contravention
of
it.
now,
the
primary
objection
to
this
statute
on
its
face
is
that
where
three
people
of
the
same
class
were
elected
officials.
my
client
who
was
removed
from
office,
client
b
who
remained
by
happenstance
or
by
deliberation
when
the
lines
were
drawn,
which
we
must
not
ignore
the
political
realities
of
life
in
this
case,
or
third
where
two
people
who
was
there
and
remained
but
had
to
go
out
because
two
of
them
resided
in
the
precinct
where
only
one
went,
so
they
both
were
declared
vacant.
so,
we
have
three
people
all
elected
justices
of
the
peace
under
this
order
who
were
treated
in
three
entirely
different
ways.
one
remains
in
office,
two
are
removed
and
then
of
course
the
same
thing
applies
to
the
voters.
there
is
no
question
whether
voters
in
one
precinct
vote
for
their
man
and
then
find
out
that
this
could
happen
again
next
week,
incidentally
they
have
the
power
to
redistrict
at
any
time.
the
only
provision
is
that
very,
very
general
statement
for
the
convenience
of
the
people
and
the
reasons
given
in
this
case
by
the
appellant,
petitioner
here
simply
were
after
the
fact
reasons.
they
were
specified
publicly
but
in
truth
and
in
fact
they
did
little
to
accomplish
what
they
wanted
except
in
two
areas.
they
got
the
people
they
wanted
in
office
and
they
created
the
minority,
ethnic
enclaves
of
two
groups
that
would
politically
help
them
in
office
which
is
graphically
reflected
and
i
don't
think
can
be
controverted
in
the
appendices
of
the
deposition
of
the
majority
commissioners.
now,
there's
one
of
the
thing
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to.
my
time
is
just
about
up
and
that
is
the
day
before
the
three-judge
court
ruled,
the
texas
attorney
general
who
is
not
here
defending
this
case,
even
though
it
has
statewide
application
to
every
county
in
texas
ruled
in
an
advisory
opinion
and
its
only
advisory
does
not
have
the
standing
of
law
that
justices
of
the
peace
and
constable
was
elected
to
full
term
are
entitled
to
serve
the
entire
four
years
and
a
redistricting
of
that
precincts
by
the
county
commissioners
court
resulting
in
a
justice
or
constable
not
living
in
his
precinct
does
not
vacate
his
office.
obviously,
they
read
the
constitutional
provisions
are
addressed
to
the
court,
also
the
rulings
in
relation
to
the
commissioners
court
in
an
attempt
to
have
equal
treatment
of
officer
within
the
same
area.
and
we
say
because
of
these
three
variances
both
as
to
voters
and
as
to
persons
within
the
same
class
that
this
statute
on
its
face,
in
itself,
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
we
requested,
i
think
one
of
my
co-counsel
requested
that
he
would
be
here
and
he
declined.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
not
in
the
future,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
no,
because
they
have
historically
ignored
generally
the
opinion.
these
are
advisory
question
and
answer
sessions.
we
could
not
get
the
relief
sought,
your
honor.
in
a
texas
court,
in
any
type
of
reasonable
or
equitable
time,
they
had
no
right
to
give
us
a
relief
under
civil
rights
act.
they
had
never
addressed
themselves
or
had
never
--
there
are
no
statutes
which
would
have
allowed
the
political
discrimination
acts
to
be
brought
up.
they
have
no
declaratory
act
of
a
similar
nature
of
the
federal
court
to
go
directly
to
the
texas
supreme
court,
although
one
of
the
respondents
tried
and
was
denied
where
they
had
an
opportunity
and
refused
it.
all
they
have
is
a
right
of
mandamus
to
direct
ministerial
acts
in
those
perfunctory
tasks.
so
we
had
to
either
come
to
federal
court
with
substantial
questions
with
a
chance
for
resolution
or
stand
by
and
go
to
the
district
court.
it
takes
16
months
in
houston
to
have
a
case
heard,
go
to
the
court
of
appeals,
another
four
to
six
months,
go
to
the
texas
supreme
court
hoping
that
somewhere
within
the
next
three
to
four
years
we
might
seek
relief
all
of
time
we
had
no
equitable.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
what
is
that,
your
honor?
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
statute.
our
position
is
the
statute
on
its
face
is
not
unclear.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
well,
this
is
an
opinion,
your
honor.
that
i
think
the
attorney
general
felt
that
because
and
he's
gave
it
in
the
face
of
--
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
of
the
statute,
i
realized
that.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
simply
i
wished
he
hadn't
because
we
have
the
matter
in
litigation
but
he
was
not
aware,
i'm
sure
of
the
fact
that
he
was
before
a
three-judge
federal
court.
again,
it
has
no
legal
bearing
on
the
state
of
texas
and
significantly
i
guess
--
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
none
whatsoever,
your
honor.
it
would
only
address
itself
to
the
limited
question,
could
they
stay
in
office.
mr.
c.
anthony
friloux,
jr.
that's
so,
it
would
not
addressed
itself
to
substantial
questions
in
the
voting.
thank
you,
your
honor.
