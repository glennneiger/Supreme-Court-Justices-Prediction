how
long
was
the
president's
term
of
office
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
long
did
he
have
to
serve
that
--
of
the
remainder
of
the
term?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
part
of
your
argument
general
bork
based
on
the
proposition
that
a
fine
is
a
less
worrisome
type
of
sanction
than
imprisonment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
why,
why
is
it
any
good
at
all
as
matter
of
fact
when
you
look
at
the
seventh
amendment
that
requires
there
is
a
trial
of
a
jury
in
its
civil
action
where
$20.00
or
more
is
involved
and
compare
it
with
the
jury
trial
provisions
in
connections
with
the
criminal
case.
it
seems
like
the
framers
thought
that
the
taking
money
was
probably
just
as
serious
a
sanction
as
putting
somebody
in
prison?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
our
society's
feeling
got
to
do
with
the
meaning
of
a
constitution?
