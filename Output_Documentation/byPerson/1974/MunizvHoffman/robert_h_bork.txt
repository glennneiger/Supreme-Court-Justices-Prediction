mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
of
the
allowable
social
response
to
a
situation
of
widespread
disorder
coupled
with
massive
and
egregious
disrespect
for
court
orders.
the
government
submits
that
the
contempt
convictions
of
both
petitioners
of
a
criminal
contempt
was
proper
and
neither
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
under
the
statute
or
by
the
constitution.
i
will
return
to
the
statutory
argument
in
a
moment,
but
it
is
rather
fully
set
forth
in
our
brief.
we
believe
that
congress
quite
deliberately
designed
it
statutes
so
that
the
labor
board
could
meet
situations
like
this
rapidly.
congress
i
think
quite
reasonably
concluded
that
both
rapidity
and
firmness
are
needed
and
that
when
the
labor
board
is
the
moving
party
as
distinct
from
an
employer,
that
none
of
the
dangers
presented
by
--
against
which
norris-laguardia
was
directed
are
present.
but,
as
i
say
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
statutory
argument
in
a
moment,
but
our
constitutional
argument
is
not
as
fully
said
forth
in
our
brief
as
i
would
like
and
i
would
like
to
modify
it
somewhat
and
develop
it
somewhat
here.
as
stated
in
our
brief,
our
first
constitutional
argument
is
that
criminal
contempt
hearings
do
not
require
a
jury
when
the
penalty
is
against
a
corporation
or
a
union.
it
can
only
be
a
fine
and
so
that
there
is
no
personal
liberty
interest
at
stake.
now
i
continue
--
we
continue
to
believe
that
that
distinction
is
an
important
one
between
a
line
--
between
fine
and
a
loss
of
personal
liberty
and
it
certainly
felt
to
be
quite
important
throughout
our
society
both
in
terms
of
the
individual
suffering
and
the
degree
of
social
disgrace
inflected.
but
that
distinction
may
not
be
enough
by
itself
to
be
adequate
to
the
concerns
of
the
constitution
in
this
area.
and
while
we
rely
upon
it
as
part
of
our
total
submission,
i
wish
to
have
other
factors
that
i
think
in
combination
with
it
are
sufficient
to
show
that
local
70
was
not
constitutionally
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
the
history
of
criminal
contempts
is
well
known
and
throughout
of
course
most
of
the
history
of
this
court
time
and
again
claims
for
jury
trials
as
constitutional
right
were
rejected.
relatively
recently
in
bloom
against
illinois,
this
court
required
a
jury
trial
for
contempt
that
resulted
in
two
years
imprisonment.
now
i
stress
the
recentness
of
that
decision,
not
in
order
to
suggest
that
it
is
not
firmly
established,
this
doctrine
but
rather
only
to
suggest
that
it
is
doctrine
at
the
beginning
of
its
growth
and
evolution
rather
than
at
the
end.
it's
important
to
recognize
i
think
that
categories
of
contempts
are
very
different,
the
offenses
are
very
different
and
the
punishments
are
very
different.
with
respect
to
some
such
as
the
one
involved
here
where
personal
liberty
as
not
at
stake
and
where
i
will
suggest
that
the
rational
of
the
bloom
opinion
does
not
quite
fit,
it
should
be
constitutionally
permissible
to
retain
the
efficacy
of
contempt
proceedings
in
their
historical
form
that
is
without
a
jury
trial.
bloom
i
think
rested
upon
two
propositions.
the
first
was
that
the
considerations
which
make
the
right
to
jury
trial
fundamental
for
serious
crimes
are
not
substantially
different
from
those
that
apply
to
serious
contempts
and
the
second
was
that
the
argument
for
jury
trial
is
even
more
compelling
in
contempt
cases
because
contemptuous
conduct
often
strikes
at
the
most
vulnerable
in
human
qualities
of
a
judge's
temperament.
the
burden
of
my
argument
will
be
to
show
that
there
are
kinds
of
contempts
that
bring
into
play
considerations
not
present
where
statutory
crimes
are
involved
and
some
of
these
considerations
are
peculiar
to
certain
contempts.
some
of
the
arguments
i
will
make
distinguish
all
contempts
from
all
crimes.
bloom
against
illinois,
so
that
was
enough,
but
i
think
when
we
add
to
that
that
some
contempts
are
different
from
other
contempts,
we're
entitled
to
look
at
these
differences
cumulatively
and
say
that
in
certain
categories
of
contempts,
a
jury
trial
may
not
be
required,
it's
not
indeed
required.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
that
i
would
say
that
perhaps
only
in
combination
with
the
additional
factors
i
wish
to
mention.
one
can
imagine
fine
so
large
that
perhaps
they
would
be
oppressive,
but
with
these
additional
factors
present
as
safeguards,
i
think
it
resulted
in
this
case,
no
jury
trial
was
required.
and
i'm
going
to
suggest
that
in
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
yes
and
i'm
going
to
suggest
that
we
are
indeed
--
i
trust
that
the
beginning
of
an
evolutionary
development
in
the
law
in
this
area
and
i
cannot
for
that
reason
make
bright
line
distinctions.
i
think
they
have
a
variety
of
factors
to
be
weighed.
i
think
they
all
point
towards
the
constitutionality
of
what
took
place
here.
but
the
--
these
factors
which
i'm
going
to
discuss
are
intended
to
respond
affirmatively
to
the
rational
of
bloom
against
illinois
and
thereby
meet
its
rational.
the
first
factor
i
will
discuss
distinguishes
all
contempts
from
all
crimes
and
i
think
as
i
say
were
entitled
considerate
as
well
as
the
special
factors
and
that
is
simply
that
the
penalty
in
the
contempt
case
is
subject
to
judicial
review
while
the
sentence
in
a
criminal
case
currently
is
not
and
that
seems
to
me
a
very
distinct
and
important
difference,
the
fundamental
safeguard
in
contempts
guarding
against
passionate
or
prejudice
tribunals
and
that's
not
yet
available
to
criminal
defendants.
the
remainder
of
the
factors
i'll
mentioned
distinguish
between
crimes
of
criminal
contempts
as
well
as
between
contempts
and
crimes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
if
it
specify
the
punishment
for
contempt,
then
i
suppose
we'd
have
to
take
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
suppose
not,
but
here
we
have
a
reviewable
fine
and
i
think
in
cases
where
we
do
have
a
reviewable
fine,
we
certainly
have
a
fundamental
safeguard,
not
available
in
the
criminal
case
which
suggests
less
need
for
the
jury
trial.
the
second
consideration
i
want
to
mention
is
that
this
case
presents
the
kind
of
criminal
contempt
conviction
that
can
be
effectively
reviewed
on
a
written
record.
it
is
not
turned
upon
the
attitude
or
tone
of
voice
or
bearing
toward
a
judge
in
the
courtroom
which
is
impossible
perhaps
to
recapture
on
a
written
record.
third,
the
offense
to
be
enjoined,
and
hence
to
be
punished
for
violation
of
a
court
order
is
not
some
vague
category
like
disrespectful
behavior,
but
is
instead
statutorily
defined
unfair
labor
practice
or
secondary
boycott
and
its
application
to
this
particular
case
is
made
quite
clear
by
the
order
which
is
served
upon
the
petitioner,
but
served
upon
the
labor
union,
local
21
and
which
petitioner
had
to
violate
before
any
sanction
became
possible.
the
petitioner
as
i
said,
much
more
advanced
warning
of
what
conduct
was
proscribed
for
him
before
he
could
be
punished
for
a
violation
of
that
order.
the
problem
of
the
human
invulnerable
qualities
of
the
judicial
temperament
mentioned
in
bloom
hardly
arises
here
because
the
conduct
was
not
disrespect
to
or
criticism
of
a
judge.
rule
42
of
the
criminal
rules
put
--
makes
particularized
judgments
of
the
kind
that
we're
talking
about
here
and
that
of
course
is
what
i'm
seeking.
there
is
one
other
difference
between
contempts
and
crimes
that
i
find
highly
relevant.
our
legal
order
throughout
its
range
places
greater
importance
upon
the
effectiveness
of
court
orders
than
it
does
upon
the
effectiveness
of
criminal
statutes.
if
a
man
deliberately
violates
a
statute
under
the
claim
that
it's
unconstitutional
should
he
established
the
unconstitutionality,
he
will
go
free.
but
should
the
same
man
knowingly
violate
a
court
order
under
the
same
claim
even
if
he
establishes
its
unconstitutionality,
he
may
be
punished.
our
legal
order
has
always
placed
greater
emphasis
upon
the
court
order
and
its
sanctity.
that
being
the
case
it
seems
to
me
desirable
that
the
superior
effectiveness
of
court
orders
be
reserved
--
be
preserved
for
some
kinds
of
situations.
otherwise,
monetary
sanctions
that
are
available
maybe
wholly
ineffective
to
prevent
massive
and
egregious
violations
of
court
orders
in
precisely
those
cases
where
they're
most
needed
and
also
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
rights
and
property
of
persons
in
the
community.
when
a
court
order
is
directed
to
a
large
organization
with
widespread
support
in
the
community,
it
is
entirely
possible
that
juries
will
not
convict.
in
such
situations,
there
may
be
hung
juries
either
because
of
sympathy
with
the
law
violators
or
because
of
fear
of
reprisal
in
that
community.
and
if
a
court
is
limited
to
imposing
only
very
small
fines
rather
jury
trial,
the
fines
are
likely
to
be
imperceptible
to
the
organization
and
the
orders
will
deter
little
or
nothing.
there
may
be
arguments
i
think
for
the
jury's
power
to
nullify
criminal
statutes
or
it
maybe
that
such
is
the
byproduct
of
our
system
that
can't
be
helped.
but
i
don't
think
nullification
by
a
jury
ought
to
be
permitted
here,
you
know,
appropriate
in
the
context
like
this
one
given
the
fact
as
i've
mentioned,
that
is
the
greater
important
of
court
orders,
the
fact
that
personal
liberty
is
not
at
hazard
and
the
safeguards
available
here
that
would
not
be
available
in
the
criminal
prosecution
under
a
statute.
plus
i
think
it
results
that
if
the
bloom
decision
is
applied
according
to
its
rationale,
no
the
jury
trial
was
required
in
the
contempt
proceedings
here.
and
i
think
that's
perhaps
all
that
would
be
said
with
respect
to
this
case,
but
perhaps
i
should
add
that
what
i'm
envisaging
in
applying
the
bloom
decision
according
to
its
rational
and
according
to
these
factors
that
must
to
weighed
as
they
occur
or
do
not
occur
is
that
we
would
enter
upon
a
classical
common
law
development
of
doctrine
in
this
area,
weighing
these
considerations
i've
mentioned
in
various
contexts,
perhaps
identifying
other
considerations.
now
that
i
think
is
not
an
objection
to
the
government's
position.
i
think
it's
rather
its
strength
because
the
process
i
described
results
in
applying
the
constitution
sensitively
according
to
the
policies
that
compete
within
the
constitution
in
this
field
and
i
think
that's
better
than
applying
a
flat
rule
that
sacrifices
important
interests
for
nothing
more
than
instant
certainty.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
i
think
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
i'm
talking
now,
muniz
has
not
raised
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
we
are
accepting
for
this
purpose,
the
distinction
between
imprisonment
and
fine.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
right.
so
that
i
would
not
be
arguing
that
no
jury
trial
was
required
if
mr.
muniz
was
sentenced
to
more
than
six
months.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
would
not
be
arguing
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
--
that
is
part
of
it.
i
don't
know
that
that
would
be
an
adequate
line
of
demarcation
all
by
itself
because
of
the
possibility
of
very
heavy
fines.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
doubt
that
that
would
be
reason
mr.
justice
rehnquist
for
the
seventh
amendment,
but
in
any
case
we
now
allow
that
taking
of
money
in
large
amounts
without
jury
trial.
our
brief
discusses
many
administrative
procedures
by
which
corporations,
collectivities
like
this
one
are
--
immersed
very
large
sums
without
the
possibility
of
jury
trial.
i
don't'
think
that's
--
i
don't
that's
unconstitutional
and
i
think
our
society
does
have
a
felt
--
does
feel
that
there's
a
difference
between
imprisonment
and
fine.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
it's
one
way
of
--
it's
one
way
of
asking
ourselves
how
much
injury
is
inflicted
upon
a
person.
now
this
court
has
said
that
for
historical
reasons,
it
will
distinguish
between
a
six-month
prison
term
and
a
six-month
and
one
day
prison
term
in
terms
of
jury
trials.
and
i
suppose
it
has
thereby
drawn
a
line
because
a
line
has
to
be
drawn,
but
the
longer
the
imprisonment
becomes
the
more
suffering
it
inflicts
and
the
more
social
disgrace
had
inflicted
because
of
societies'
feeling
about
them.
and
i'm
really
suggesting
to
you
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
degree
in
our
perceptions,
in
society's
feeling
and
indeed
in
the
individual
suffering
when
the
penalty
is
a
fine
rather
than
imprisonment.
but
in
any
event,
i
think
these
other
factors
i
suggest
also
argue
in
the
same
direction.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
not
a
bit,
not
a
bit
mr.
justice
brennan.
but
in
the
absence
of
a
statute,
i
am
suggesting
that
the
constitution
--
i
don't
think
there
was
a
statute
here
that
required
a
jury
trial.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
did
nothing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
or
there
maybe
a
occasions
mr.
justice
brennan
which
i
think
we
need
not
reach
here
which
have
congress
purported
it
--
deprived
the
court
of
any
ability
to
function
as
a
court,
such
statute
might
be
unconstitutional,
but
i
don't
think
we're
discussing
that
range
of
considerations
in
this
case
and
i
trust
we
will
never
have
to
discuss
that
range
of
considerations,
but
it
is
useful
to
mention
congress
because
the
evolution
i'm
discussing
need
not
to
be
entirely
judicial.
it's
appropriate
that
congress
have
its
attention
refocused
upon
this
problem
and
that
we
have
legislative
judgments
fed
into
the
process
as
we
move
towards
a
resolution
of
this
issue.
our
alternative
submission
on
the
constitutional
issue
is
quite
fully
developed
in
our
brief
and
i
will
merely
touch
upon
it.
it
is
that
a
$10,000.00
fine
imposed
upon
a
large
organization
like
this
one
is
obviously
not
so
substantial
to
make
--
as
to
make
the
offense
more
than
petty.
the
reliance
upon
18
u.s.c
13
about
petty
offenses,
i
think
is
misplaced.
that
statute
was
passed
about
1930
with
totally
different
things
in
mind,
was
not
addressed
to
contempt
and
furthermore,
i
don't
think
that
statute
makes
it
possible
to
equate
six
months
imprisonment
with
$500.00
fine
particularly
in
view
of
the
fact
it
goes
on
to
say
or
both
so
that
--
we
would
be
left
with
peculiar
logical
proposition
that
you
could
impose
six
months
plus
$500.00
but
not
six
months
plus
one
day
or
$501.00
separately.
i
think
realism
has
to
have
its
claim
in
this
field
of
constitutional
law
and
it
appears
that
they're
at
least
35,000
people
who
pay
dues
to
local
70
or
pay
fees
to
local
70
and
when
we
look
at
what
that
means,
it
comes
out
--
this
fine
comes
up
about
80
cents
per
person,
per
head.
and
if
the
law
has
to
correspond
to
reality
in
making
distinctions
about
what
is
severe
and
what
is
petty
or
serious
and
petty,
that
factor
i
think
has
to
be
taken
into
account
indeed
i
think
is
dispositive.
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
the
argument
about
the
statute
because
i
think
there
are
two
issues
there
and
the
first
one
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
distinction
after
taft-hartley
between
cases
where
a
private
employer
sought
an
injunction
and
sought
a
contempt.
in
cases
where
the
labor
board
did
and
i
think
there
was.
norris-laguardia
ruled
the
further,
the
first
and
taft-hartley
and
wagner
act
to
the
second
and
i
think
there
was
no
jury
trial
requirement
there.
the
second
issue
then
is,
did
the
enactment
of
18
u.s.c
3692
suddenly
wipe
out
the
distinction
thus
laboriously
made
and
i
will
not
rehearse
the
entire
history
of
these
statutes
as
they
came
into
effect,
but
let
me
say
only
this.
the
evidence
that
just
before
3692
was
passed
that
there
was
no
requirement
in
the
law
that
a
board
order
like
this
one,
a
board
petition
for
an
injunction
which
was
violated
and
followed
by
criminal
contempt
like
this
one,
required
a
jury
trial
as
this.
the
norris-laguardia
act
of
1932
in
itself
expressly
applied
only
to
cases
arising
under
this
act.
the
united
mine
workers
case
shows
that
there
were
cases
which
did
not
arise
under
norris-laguardia.
furthermore,
the
wagner
act
of
1935
in
section
10
(h)
explicitly
made
every
section
of
norris-laguardia
inapplicable
including
specifically
the
jury
trial
section
of
norris-laguardia,
the
court
orders
obtained
the
board.
at
the
end
of
section
10
(h),
it
cites
every
section
of
norris
laguardia
as
made
inapplicable
including
section
111
which
is
the
jury
trial
provision.
frankly,
there's
no
doubt
that
after
the
wagner
act,
board
orders
are
not
governed
by
--
they're
simply
not
governed
by
the
jury
trial
requirement
of
norris-laguardia
act.
now
the
taft-hartley
act
in
47
not
only
retain
10
(h)
which
governs
10
(l)
as
well
as
10
(j)
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
mr.
justice
white.
i
am
saying
that
it
is
quite
plain
from
the
evidence
i
am
summarizing
beginning
with
the
arising
out
of
language
of
norris-laguardia
--
arising
under
this
act
going
on
to
the
explicit
statement
in
10
(h)
of
the
wagner
act
that
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
including
section
111
don't
apply
to
that
section
which
shows
that
the
jury
trial
requirement
was
lifted.
i'm
saying
in
addition
that
10
(l)
when
it
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
taft-hartley
act
speaks
of
power
to
enjoin
not
with
understanding
any
other
provision
of
law,
but
perhaps
more
importantly
left
10
(h)
standing.
and
we
discussed
in
our
brief
the
fact
that
senator
ball
tried
to
amend
section
10
(l)
saying
that
as
presently
written,
it
completely
lifted
the
norris-laguardia
jury
trial
requirement
and
he
would
put
it
back
in
part,
the
ball
memo
was
rejected.
in
addition
to
that,
there's
been
a
consistent
course
of
practice
and
understanding
by
the
board
and
by
all
kinds
of
people
including
most
courts
up
until
quite
recently
for
25
years
which
everybody
read.
this
statutory
scheme
as
protecting
against
labor
injunctions
brought
by
employers,
that
after
was
the
--
at
the
evil
at
which
norris-laguardia
was
aimed
and
after
the
labor
board
came
into
effect,
that
evil
was
no
longer
so
necessary
to
be
guarded
against.
congress
laid
down
the
guidelines
of
what
could
be
done
and
what
could
not
be
done
and
the
labor
board
was
expected
to
operate
fairly
within
those
guidelines,
hence,
the
relaxation
of
norris-laguardia
safeguards
when
the
labor
board
is
involved.
but
given
those
factors,
i
don't
think
there
can
be
any
doubt
that
just
prior
to
enactment
of
3692,
labor
board
sought
injunctions,
did
not
require
jury
trials
for
criminal
contempt
proceedings.
now,
that
main
arguments
petitioners
urge
is
of
3692.
in
the
year
following,
taft-hartley,
right
after
congress
had
made
this
distinction,
obliterated
every
trace
of
the
distinction
and
did
it
without
a
word
of
debate
in
congress
under
taft-hartley
not
being
exercised.
rather
a
word
of
debate
in
congress
or
comment
or
even
notation
that
it
had
been
done.
and
i
think
that's
simply
not
credible
and
until
recently
for
over
25
years,
no
court
thought
it
was
credible
and
certainly
the
people
who
recodified
title
18
to
bring
section
11
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
in
the
title
18
do
not
seem
to
have
noticed
that
they
were
making
any
sweeping
change
in
the
law
because
all
of
the
revisers
notes
go
in
extensively
to
noting
and
explaining
changes
in
substantive
law,
nothing
of
the
sort
is
found
with
respect
to
3692.
and
i
think
it's
utterly
implausible
to
argue
that
a
major
change
in
the
nation's
labor
policy
was
made
in
that
way
and
therefore
i
think
it
should
extraordinarily
plain
and
indeed
compelling
language
to
reach
petitioner's
result
and
the
language
of
3692
does
not
meet
that
test.
the
language
is
not
so
plain
that
if
one
could
afford
to
ignore
its
legal
context.
we
know
it
was
taken
directly
from
norris-laguardia
and
the
revisers
must
have
thought
it
entirely
natural
to
refer
to
the
same
subject
matter
in
the
terms
that
norris-laguardia
employs,
that
is
a
case
involving
or
growing
out
of
a
labor
dispute.
that's
norris-laguardia
language
and
that
context
suggests
they
thought
they
were
transplanting
the
clause
not
suddenly
swallowing
up
distinctions
made
in
the
wagner
act
and
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
they
repealed
--
my
repealed
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
for
this
purpose,
they
repealed
section
11
and
took
--
they
picked
the
provision
up
and
put
it
over
in
title
18
and
it
can
no
longer
be
cases
arising
under
this
act.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
the
new
language
mr.
justice
brennan
does
--
is
a
case
involving
or
growing
out
of
labor
dispute
which
is
norris-laguardia
language.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
has
to.
for
one
thing,
you
get
a
distinction
that
doesn't
more
sense
if
you
read
the
statute
the
way
the
petitioner
does,
petitioners
do,
that
is
this.
not
all
labor
disputes
and
unfair
labor
practice
are
not
co-terminus
terms.
you
can
have
an
unfair
labor
practice
quite
clearly
without
a
labor
dispute.
the
reading
here
is
that
in
any
case
in
which
there's
not
a
labor
dispute,
but
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice,
you
can
get
an
injunction
and
a
trial
for
criminal
contempt
without
a
jury,
but
if
it
involves
also
both
the
labor
dispute,
you
can't.
i
don't
think
that
makes
--
that's
a
difference
that
doesn't
make
a
great
deal
of
sense.
the
reading
we
give
3692
says
that,
“you
get
a
jury
trial
when
an
employer
is
trying
to
get
an
injunction
and
try
you
for
contempt,
but
not
when
the
labor
board
does
and
that's
a
distinction
that
makes
policy
sense.”
now,
and
the
facts,
the
distinction
that
the
80th
congress
which
passed
taft-hartley
made
the
year
before,
and
it
was
also
the
80th
congress
that
voted
in
3692
which
is
another
reason
why
it's
impossible
to
believe
that
the
80th
congress
didn't
even
mention
the
change
they
were
making.
but
in
our
brief,
we
point
out
to
the
fact
that
representative
seller
who
had
been
chairman
of
the
committee
considering
this
title
18,
some
10
years
later
rather
heatedly
denied
that
he'd
made
the
jury
trial
provision
applicable
to
taft-hartley
in
3692,
but
i
think
i
should
raise
one
warning
signal.
petitioners'
argument
proceeds
upon
a
flat,
mechanical
and
rather
simplest
reading
of
the
language
which
has
context
and
growth
and
has
meaning.
if
that
method
of
reading
3692
were
accepted,
this
court
would
then
very
shortly
be
faced
with
the
claim
that
by
the
same
kind
of
reading
of
a
plain
language,
no
civil
contempts
required
jury
trials
because
this
language
doesn't
distinguish
between
civil
and
criminal
contempts
and
if
you
read
it
without
context,
that's
what
happens.
furthermore,
it
would
turn
out
that
no
matter
how
small
the
fine,
$1.00
fine
requires
a
jury
trial
for
contempt
of
the
court
order
if
you
accept
this
flat
mode
of
reading
of
statute
which
i
say
is
totally
foreign
to
its
history
and
to
its
context.
so
i
suggest
that
the
statute
should
not
be
read
that
mechanically
and
without
regard
to
context
or
evidence
so
that
major
congressional
policies
are
destroyed
on
no
basis
than
what
can
be
called
a
rather
simplistic
semanticism
and
we
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
