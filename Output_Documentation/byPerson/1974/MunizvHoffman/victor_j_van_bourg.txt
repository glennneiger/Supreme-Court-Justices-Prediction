mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
of
course
is
the
question
of
jury
trial
in
criminal
contempt
matters
and
we
have
two
distinct
arguments,
one
being
the
constitutional
argument
and
one
being
the
statutory
argument.
i
think
the
constitutional
question
has
to
be
discussed
first
and
we
will
undertake
to
do
that
because
it
rests
upon
the
vague
line
of
what
is
a
serious
offense
and
what
is
a
petty
offense
and
the
only
statutory
assistance
we
have
is
title
18,
section
1,
sub
3,
namely
the
$500.00
provision
and
the
six-month
imprisonment
provision.
the
adjudication
in
criminal
contempt
in
this
case
leaves
as
a
great
deal
to
be
desired
with
respect
to
clarity
on
that
point.
we
have
a
fine
of
$25,000.00,
$15,000.00
of
which
is
suspended
much
as
would
be
the
case
in
civil
contempt,
i.e.
behave
yourself
for
a
year
and
that
$15,000.00
will
not
be
reinstated,
but
if
you
misbehave
the
full
$15,000.00
will
be
reinstated
and
the
degree
of
misbehavior
is
not
discussed.
it's
not
--
there
is
no
determination
as
to
whether
it
would
be
the
same
kind
of
a
proceeding
as
if
we
would
have
a
motion
to
revoke
probation.
on
the
imprisonment
side,
the
individual,
muniz
is
told
that
he's
on
probation
for
a
year
and
that
the
--
it's
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
court
retains
jurisdiction
to
impose
a
six-month
prison
sentence
or
jail
sentence.
again,
we
have
some
vagueness
in
the
judge's
orders,
but
the
critical
question
is
whether
or
not
this
is
a
serious
or
a
petty
offense
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
question.
this
was
not
a
multi-count
issue
insofar
as
the
adjudication
was
concerned.
it
was
treated
as
a
single
count.
it
is
a
$25,000.00
or
$10,000.00
fine
depending
upon
how
you
want
to
view
it
and
there
is
a
criminal
record
imposed
upon
an
individual
human
being
who
has
the
potential
of
going
to
prison
or
jail.
now
why
do
we
even
deal
with
that
issue
when
we
seem
to
have
a
clear
cut,
a
much
clear
cut
presentation
on
the
statutory
side?
i
think
it's
very
important
for
us
to
deal
with
that
issue
because
we
find
ourselves
confronted
with
contempts
and
injunctions
throughout
various
phases
of
the
law
and
i
think
it's
critical
that
we
deal
with
the
constitutional
question
on
the
jury
side.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
has
not
appealed
--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
because
of
the
nature,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
adjudication,
we
do
not
appeal
on
the
criminal
side
for
james
muniz.
we
appeal
only
with
respect
to
the
union
on
the
constitutional
side.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
now
the
issue
your
honor
is
--
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
yes,
he
makes
the
statutory
argument.
the
union
makes
the
constitutional
argument
and
the
statutory
argument,
muniz,
the
individual
makes
the
statutory
argument.
but
the
understanding,
the
fulcrum
question,
the
understanding
of
how
an
institution
such
as
a
labor
organization
operates
is
what's
fundamental
to
the
whole
trial
of
the
case.
the
union
itself
did
nothing.
the
union
was
held
in
contempt
and
adjudicated
in
criminal
contempt
and
they
ordered
to
show
cause
against
it
as
an
alleged
contempt
nor
was
based
upon
the
conduct
of
the
individual
muniz.
now,
labor
organization
does
not
authorize
its
officers,
the
president
in
this
case
to
engage
in
criminal
action.
so
all
of
the
knowledge,
all
of
the
conduct,
all
of
the
assumed
knowledge,
all
of
the
imputed
conduct
done
by
the
individual
is
attributed
to
the
organization
without
anything
further
being
done
or
said
or
presented.
so
the
$25,000.00
exposure
to
the
union
is
part
and
parcel
and
cannot
to
be
connected
with
the
adjudication
with
respect
to
the
probation
and
the
potential
of
six-month
jail
for
muniz.
the
theory
being
is
discussed
in
the
cases
and
as
discussed
in
all
the
briefs
that
the
union
can't
go
to
jail,
but
its
president
can.
so
this
contempt
is
--
the
adjudication
as
the
same
as
it
is
in
most
cases.
the
union
has
fined
that
is
will
hurt
their
treasury.
the
members
who
made
no
consent
whatsoever,
no
proof
that
they
even
knew
about
the
conduct,
their
pocket
books
are
going
to
be
hurt,
but
the
president,
we're
going
to
put
him
in
jail
or
put
him
on
probation.
now
that's
--
even
though
muniz
only
can
argue
of
the
statutory
question,
the
fundamentals
of
the
case,
the
notion
of
contempt
in
general
with
respect
to
labor
organizations
and
their
officers
and
their
exposure
is
fundamentally
connected.
now
i
think
that
it
would
belabor
the
point
for
us
to
recite
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
to
review
again
and
again
the
provisions
of
the
section
1,
sub
3
of
title
18
with
respect
to
the
$500.00
fine
and
the
six-month
jail
sentence.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
it
is
different
in
many
respects
for
this
reason.
a
labor
organization
does
have
a
different
life,
does
have
a
different
foundation
and
is
governed
by
different
statutory
considerations
than
a
corporation.
the
critical
one
being
that
they
have
constitutions
governing
much
more
precisely
what
can
be,
what
cannot
be
done
by
officers
and
the
congressional
enactment
specifying
the
types
of
things
that
union
officers
and
unions
in
general
can
and
can't
do.
of
course
corporations
are
governed
by
different
statutory
prescriptions
and
proscriptions
and
they
too
have
bylaws
and
they
too
have
articles
of
incorporation
so
in
a
general
legal
sense
of
course
a
corporation
and
a
union
can
be
equated
as
to
the
type
of
legal
person
they
are.
but
with
respect
to
how
labor
unions
are
organized
and
how
they
are
regulated
by
statutory
enactments
and
indeed
as
to
how
they
are
treated
by
the
courts,
the
practical
aspects
are
that
they
are
different
from
corporations
particularly
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
yes,
they
can.
the
union
membership
however,
unless
it
has
an
impeachment
procedure
as
is
required
under
the
landrum-griffin
provisions
of
1959
cannot
fire
the
president
of
the
union.
he
is
elected
for
a
specified
term
and
he
cannot
be
fired.
now,
impeachment
provisions
exist,
impeachment
proceedings
maybe
brought.
they
are
rare
and
it
would
require
in
this
case
a
local
union
of
7000
to
9000
members
for
the
unions
to
have
knowledge
of
what's
happening
as
the
basis
for
the
proceedings
and
to
bring
the
impeachment
proceedings.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
at
the
time
of
this
conduct
was
engaged
in,
it
was
his
first
term
and
it
was
not
a
full
term.
in
other
words,
he
took
over
in
the
middle
of
a
term.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
as
i
recall
it,
it
was
one
half
or
two-thirds
of
a
three
year
term.
now
my
recollection
is
not
that
clear
on
that
point,
but
it
is
true
and
so
that
the
court
is
aware
of
the
fact,
he
was
reelected
for
another
term
subsequently.
i
don't
want
that
issue
to
cloud
any
of
the
questions
that
have
to
be
determined
here,
but
i
do
think
that
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
contempt
as
to
an
organization,
the
solicitor
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
because
this
is
a
corporation
that
right
to
jury
trial
in
his
words,
“shall
not
be
extended
to
a
labor
organization.”
well,
i
don't
think
the
question
of
a
constitution
of
the
united
states
deals
with
extension
of
constitutional
rights.
the
constitutional
rights
are
there
and
the
thing
is
a
little
bit
twisted
around.
it
is
the
solicitor
who
argues
that
that
right
should
be
taken
away
from
the
union.
now
it's
true
that
the
courts
have
dealt
differently
with
respect
to
corporate
or
associate
persons
as
opposed
to
humans
in
terms
of
how
they
have
dealt
with
the
question
of
a
jury
trial
and
cheff
is
a
good
example
of
course
of
that
issue,
nonetheless,
the
constitutional
issue
i
think
is
clear,
the
line
has
to
be
drawn.
lawyers
who
try
these
cases
both
as
to
corporate
persons
and
as
to
individuals
have
to
know
the
line
between
the
petty
offense
and
the
serious
offense.
we
always
take
the
position
of
the
$500.00
and
the
six
months
and
indeed
in
this
case,
the
judge
in
reserving
jurisdiction
on
the
adjudication
of
criminal
contempt
used
the
six-month
rule
or
measured
as
the
basis
for
the
jail
term
or
the
potential
jail
term
with
respect
to
petitioner
muniz.
he
did
not
however,
used
the
$500.00
rule
in
imposing
the
fine.
i
will
not
say
more
at
this
time
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
question
again
because
i
think
that's
--
it
would
belabor
the
point
to
go
over
that
again,
the
court
obviously
has
all
of
the
briefs
before
it.
i
do,
however,
want
to
discuss
the
statutory
question
with
some
emphasis.
we
have
the
clear
language
of
3692.
we
have
an
absolute
contradiction
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
our
decision
in
the
case
that
was
rendered
in
the
first
circuit
in
union
nacional.
i
think
that
that
issue
thus
is
squarely
before
the
court.
now,
the
thrust
of
the
solicitor's
argument
that
a
jury
trial
is
not
necessary
in
this
kind
of
a
contempt
would
require
and
of
course
we
agree
and
urge
the
conclusion
of
the
decision
in
nacional,
would
require
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
to
be
negated
and
that
the
court
not
pay
attention
to
the
phrase
any
case
involving
a
labor
dispute.
there
is
no
question
that
the
fact
situation
in
our
case
involves
a
labor
dispute,
none
whatsoever.
there
is
no
question
that
it
is
the
kind
of
a
labor
dispute
which
is
either
protected
or
prohibited
or
governed
or
regulated
by
taft-hartley
as
well
as
perhaps
by
other
statutes.
there
is
no
question
that
it
arises
--
a
cause
of
action
arises
because
of
statutes
of
the
united
states.
there
is
no
question
that
the
petition
was
sought
by
the
regional
director
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
section
10
(l)
of
taft-hartley.
nacional
deals
with
10
(j)
but
the
authority
of
the
regional
director
to
petition
for
injunctive
relief
was
specifically
the
same
under
10
(j)
as
it
is
under
10
(l).
now,
it
is
urged
upon
the
court
that
congress
did
not
intend
a
jury
trial
in
the
contempt
provision
--
in
a
contempt
proceeding
to
prevail
because
that
would
interfere
with
the
orderly
processing
of
the
scheme
of
regulation
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
we
submit
that
that
is
incorrect
and
should
not
be
accepted
by
the
court.
the
basis
for
the
submission
is
the
fact
that
civil
contempt
has
to
do
with
compliance
with
the
order.
that
was
even
conceded
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
our
case.
criminal
contempt
has
to
do
with
punishment
not
compliance.
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
punishment
was
severe
and
the
appendices
to
the
various
briefs,
the
transcript
references
wherein
the
district
court
judge
discussed
the
penalties
are
clear.
the
counsel
for
--
the
general
counsel
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
urged
upon
the
court
that
this
was
a
very
serious
offense
and
urged
that
the
union
and
muniz
be
punished.
3692
clearly
therefore
would
require
a
jury
trial
and
we
can
see
no
way
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
and
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
can
be
evaded
or
avoided.
indeed,
if
the
solicitor
were
to
prevail,
if
the
government's
interpretation
of
3692
were
to
prevail,
congress
would
have
engaged
in
nullity.
the
act
would
have
been
totally
void.
3692
is
not
a
mere
recodification
of
what
previously
had
existed
in
section
11
of
norris-laguardia
because
at
the
time
that
section
11
of
norris-laguardia
was
enacted,
the
broadened
scope
of
statutory
chipping
away
of
the
protections
against
injunctive
relief
under
norris-laguardia
had
not
yet
occurred
or
had
not
occurred
in
its
fuller
measure.
section
10
(l)
is
a
taft-hartley
amendment
and
the
timing
of
the
various
statutory
provisions
is
important.
3692
is
a
1948
enactment.
10
(l)
is
a
1947
enactment,
so
congress
knew
about
10
(l)
at
the
time
they
enacted
that
provision.
and
there's
much
discussion
of
the
1947
mine
workers
case
which
dealt
with
the
mine
seizure
situation,
the
fact
situation
arose
in
1946
dealt
with
a
peculiar
and
special
problem
under
a
statute
which
had
not
as
yet
been
enacted
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
namely
3692.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
decision
on
the
statutory
question
of
the
court
in
the
first
circuit
in
union
nacional
should
be
followed
by
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
we'll
reserve
the
balance
of
our
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
yes
i
do
mr.
chief
justice,
just
if
i
can
for
a
moment.
i
believe
i
have
a
few
minutes
left.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
i
think
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
state
as
the
solicitor
has
stated
that
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
the
posture
taken
by
the
first
circuit
in
union
nacional
that
you
would
be
making
a
major
change
in
the
nation's
labor
policy.
the
nation's
labor
policy
is
first
enunciated
in
1932
in
enacting
norris-laguardia
saying,
“courts,
do
not
interfere
with
the
peaceful
processing
of
labor
disputes
between
labor
and
management.”
and
then
in
1935
by
enacting
the
wagner
act
and
then
in
the
massive
amendments
of
1947
in
taft-hartley,
at
no
time
that
congress
set
a
labor
policy
dealing
with
the
question
of
jury
trials
in
criminal
contempts.
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
the
constitution
of
united
states,
the
question
of
jury
trial
was
not
conceived
as
part
of
the
national
labor
policy
at
any
time
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
it
didn't
presume
that
the
wagner
act
or
taft-hartley
trenched
upon
notions
of
jury
trial
and
i'm
troubled
by
the
fact
that
the
solicitor
general
is
arguing
against
the
concept
on
the
notion
of
a
jury
trial
on
the
constitutional
side
using
the
arguments
that
have
been
traditionally
used
that
juries
cannot
see
these
things
clearly
they
made,
have
sympathy
towards
the
accused
or
they're
maybe
frightened
of
the
accused.
the
context
of
this
case
arises
in
a
metropolitan
area
of
some
four
million
people
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area.
i
don't
think
that
we
have
that
kind
of
evidence
that
the
juries
would
be
so
blind
to
the
facts
and
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
case
in
which
a
jury
trial
is
necessary
because
the
judge
may
have
been
unable
to
determine
the
facts
that
had
to
be
determined
to
protect
the
accused.
why
do
i
say
that?
the
solicitor
glosses
over
the
fact.
he
says
that
the
petitioner
in
his
argument
before
this
court,
he
argues
that
the
petitioners
had
notice
of
the
injunction
and
its
provisions
by
service
on
local
21.
local
21
is
the
typographical
union,
one
of
the
alleged
contempt
noirs.
local
70
is
the
in
the
teamsters
union,
is
a
teamsters
affiliate,
totally
separate
from
a
typographical
union.
but
why
is
that
important?
why
should
that
fact
even
be
argued
or
pointed
out?
it's
because
the
whole
process
of
a
10
(l)
injunction
is
started
by
the
filling
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
by
a
person,
individual
or
employer
or
another
labor
organization.
after
the
charge
is
filed
the
regional
director,
if
he
has
reasonably
concluded
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
may
have
been
committed
and
determines
to
issue
a
complaint
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
may
seek
a
petition
under
section
10
(l)
against
the
labor
organization
against
whom
the
charge
was
filed.
it
is
that
determination
subjective
and
factual
determination
that
is
made
by
the
regional
director
that
starts
the
process
of
petitioning
the
district
court
for
an
injunction
under
section
10
(l).
in
this
case,
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
charge
filed
against
local
70.
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
charge
filed
against
james
muniz.
there
was
no
intention
to
issue
a
complaint
against
them
at
the
time
of
this
trial.
there
was
no
10
(l)
injunction
sought
against
muniz
or
local
70.
they
were
not
parties
to
the
charge.
they
were
not
parties
to
the
injunctive
proceedings.
they
were
given
no
notice
of
the
injunction.
and
at
the
time
of
the
contempt
trial
and
at
the
time
of
the
adjudication,
both
civil
and
criminal,
the
board
still
had
not
made
them
parties
and
they
had
never
been
served
and
counsel,
for
the
general
counsel
when
he
argued
the
case
conceded
that
they
had
never
been
served
with
the
underlying
papers.
and
yet,
the
conditions
precedent
to
the
determination
that
someone
is
guilty
of
criminal
contempt
is
the
finding
of
knowledge,
notice
and
intent
to
deliberately
avoid
or
violate
the
injunction.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
yes,
you
did.
mr.
victor
j.
van
bourg
no.
it
is
not.
i
think
however,
that
the
arguments
on
the
social
policy
of
the
country
required
that
if
an
argument
is
made
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
case
which
would
require
a
jury
trial,
i
submit
it
is
precisely
the
kind
of
a
case
where
there
are
factual
questions
to
be
determined,
i.e.
notice,
knowledge,
intent
to
violate
and
i
would
like
to
just
conclude
by
one
other
item.
it
is
true
that
the
labor
board
is
expected
as
are
all
government
agencies
expected
to
act
fairly
in
the
seeking
of
injunctions
and
enforcing
them.
if
the
civil
contempt
procedure
is
designed
to
vindicate
the
court's
order
and
to
show
its
compliance
and
the
jury
question
in
a
civil
contempt
matter
is
not
before
the
court,
and
if
the
criminal
contempt
procedure
is
designed
to
punish
rather
than
to
vindicate
and
seek
compliance
of
the
court's
order,
then
it
makes
no
sense
to
give
either
a
restricted
constitutional
determination
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
which
after
all
is
fundamental
in
this
society
for
talking
about
societal
views
nor
a
restrictive
meaning
other
than
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
under
section
3692.
thank
you
very
much
mr.
chief
justice.
