mr.
solicitor
general,
i
gather
none
of
these
factors
are
arduous,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
any
--
do
these
factors
singly
or
in
combination
suggest
unconstitutionality
in
the
statute
which
required
a
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
was
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
emphasis
on
that
had
the
sound
of
separation
of
powers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
there
are
some
things
that
this
being
judicial
orders
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

the
substitution
--
the
substituted
language
is
much
broader
though,
isn't

section
11
initially.
section
11
was
just
cases
arising
under
this
act,

in
norris-laguardia,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right
and
--
but
the
substitution
arising
under
the
laws
of
united
states
governing
issuance
of
injunctions
or
restraining
orders
in
any
case
involving
or
growing
out
of
a
labor
dispute.
what's
the
new
language
of
this
--
the
substituted
language
for
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
think
that's
what
ties
it,
limits
it
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
didn't
we
grant,
didn't
we
not
to
exclude
question
one
which
raises
that
as

justice
william
j.
brennan,

so
that's
not
before
us.
