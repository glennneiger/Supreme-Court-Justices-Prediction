justice
byron
r.
white
what
proviso
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
find
it
in
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
bottom
three
lines.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
but
counsel
as
i
understand
that
it’s
your
position
that
the
wager
should
be
paid
in
gross?
justice
byron
r.
white
and?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
care
what
you
call
them.
but
anyway,
you
want
them
paid
in
gross?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
of
authority
supporting
your
position
flatly
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
an
array
of
cases
internally
inconsistent,
first,
second
and
fourth,
but
none
of
them
support
your
position
at
this
point
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
if
you
said
that
this
tax
claim
was
the
fourth
priority
or
unsecured
at
all,
or
not
secured
at
all,
or
no
priority
at
all.
would
it
necessarily
follow
that
the
trustee
would
not
have
to
file
and
withholding
tax
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
you
pay
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
i
know
that
he
got
to
be
paying
wages,
he
is
going
to
be
paying
$600.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
still
could
be
held
that
he’s
paying
wages.
and
if
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
the
--
the
people
by
whom
wages
are
owed,
or
owed
by
bankrupt
up
to
$600.00
you’re
going
to
paid,
don’t
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
trustee
is
going
to
pay
them,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
well,
so
those
are
the
distributions
that
are
going
to
be
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
the
trustee
can
withhold
them
--
can
withhold
the
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
claims
that
are
going
to
be
filed
to
pay
their
wage
claims?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
fellow
was
owed
this
$599.00
and
he
gets
it
all,
i
suppose
he
thinks
he's
got
his
wages?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
usually
pay
wages
or
wage
claims
pretty
fast?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you're
right
--
if
you’re
right
that
these
wage
claims,
that
these
tax
pay
might
be
--
had
no
priority
at
all,
what
the
trustee
would
do
is
to
withhold
the
money
and
that
would
go
into
the
unsecured
--.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
is
that
what
you
claim
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
are
you
--
you’re
supporting
the
judgment
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
were
--
but
if
you
were
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
accept
your
argument,
the
result
below
might
be
different.
i
mean
in
terms
of
who
gets
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
--
but
you
really
want
to
secure
more
than
you
got
on
judgment
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
petition
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
know
that
--
it
says
you're
not
only,
not
entitled
to
the
administration
expenses
but
you’re
not
entitled
to
the
priority
(inaudible).
so,
i
don’t
know
that
the
--
it's
a
very
good
position
to
or
you're
in
a
very
good
position
to
say
that
he's
raising
the
issue.
he
leaves
you
of
the
necessity
to
cross
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
suggesting
that
surely
we're
not
required
by
the
failure
of
the
government
to
cross
petition,
to
affirm
what
we
think
is
an
erroneous
holding
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
expand
for
me
the
government's
theory
as
to
why
they
should
be
first
priority?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
(inaudible)
the
taxes
which
improve
during
the
administration?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
this
tax
had
to
be
related
to
wages
earned
before
bankruptcy
and
arguably
these
taxes
would
all
be
treated
like
real
property
taxes
that
were
due
and
owing
in
kind
of
bankruptcy.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
it
say
i
would
put
it
in
the
fourth
priority.
it
can't
just
that
i
would
put
it
in
the
administration
expenses.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
was
also
saying
that
collier
was
directed
to
the
taxes
incurred
in
the
operations
of
the
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
there
weren't
lot
of
cases
holding
there
for
that
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
word
and
you
probably
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
some
other
case
it
can
make
a
difference
whether
it
was
administration
expense
or
second
priority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they've
got
to
some
reason
for
making
this
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
should
have
asked
the
government
this
question.
they
must
have
some
reason
to
be
making
the
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
where
there's
not
enough
assets
to
pay
the
wage
claims
they
would
suffer
too
if
the
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
what
their
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
say
that
as
far
as
you
can
see
it
doesn't
make
that
much
difference
in
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
is
now
got
therefore,
the
only
thing
is
the
administration
expense
would
be
25%
of
$50,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
wouldn't,
and
you
say
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
warms,
is
this
like
a
prior
theories
which
i
think
emerged
first
time
in
this
case
in
the
second
circuit,
is
this
your
argument
below
that
the
court
pick
it
up
on
it's
own
clear
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
warms,
have
you
ever
studied
calculus
of
differential
equations?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
just
seems
to
me
that
here
you
have
two
dependent
of
variables
with
one
constant
which
you've
forgotten
to
with
the
amount
of
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
proviso
is
that?
