rehnquist
under
your
theory
mr.
karasik,
would
the
employees
be
nonetheless
credited
with
having
paid
the
withheld
taxes?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
will
show
of
any
cost
of
administration
isn't?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
include
social
security
as
well
as
income
tax
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
of
course,
it
goes
further
than
that?
doesn’t
it,
mr.
jones
it
isn’t
just
a
question
of
what
maybe
raised
here
but
it’s
a
question
of
whether
if
you
want
to
get
a
more
favorable
result
than
the
second
circuit
gave
you
whether
you
don’t
have
to
cross
petition.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
collier
you're
speaking
or
are
there
some
cases
to
support
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nonetheless
it's
25%
of
a
smaller
amount
in
the
total
wages
claimed,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
other
words,
you
tax
only
what
is
paid
up.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
so
far
as
net
receipts
to
the
treasury
is
concerned,
if
you
pay
a
$100,000.00
on
a
$100,000.00
wage
claim,
and
subtract
25%
for
tax,
the
government
is
getting
more
money
than
it
would
if
you
pay
$50,000.00
on
a
$100,000.00
wage
claim
and
pay
$12,500.00
to
the
government?
