mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
not
sure,
i’m
sure
that
i
follow
the
theory
behind
your
comparison,
it
doesn't
hurt
the
government
very
much
but
it
does
hurt
the
creditors
a
great
deal.
how
is
that
relevant
to
issues
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
simply
because
we
have
a
$300
billion
or
$400
billion
i've
forgotten
what
it
is,
now,
$300
billion
or
$400
billion
budget
but
what's
that
got
to
do
with
the
creditor.

would
vary
from
small
creditors
to
large,
many
creditors

a
few
creditors.

resume
there
right
after
lunch.
you
may
continue
mr.

a
receiver
for
example,
in
a
federal
or
a
state
proceeding
trustee
and
bankruptcy?
why
would
it
be
anymore
true
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
--
i
don’t
quite
get
your
answer
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
certain
derivative
responsibilities
that
follow
the

are
there
not?
chief
