mr.
samuel
j.
warms
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
shall
confine
my
argument
to
the
priorities
question
and
support
the
holding
of
the
court
below
which
held
that
the
withholding
tax
claims
in
question
were
wage
claims.
now,
while
the
united
states
government's
argument
suits
our
book
as
well,
we
would
fair
just
as
well
a
distribution
would
be
precisely
that
which
was
ordered
by
the
court
below.
we
feel
that
the
court's
position
which
was
our
position
there
and
is
our
position
here
is
more
logical
and
it
also
better
answers
the
arguments
of
the
trustee
against
any
priority
status.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
i
can
concede
none
under
the
way
we
rush
--
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
yes,
they
do,
mr.
justice
white
they
do,
because
they
are
afraid
that
in
the
case
where
after
the
payment
of
administration
expenses
other
than
these
they
will
not
--
and
where
there's
nothing
enough
left
to
execute
a
payment
in
full,
that
there
will
be
diminution
in
the
amount
of
tax
claims.
now
they
set
that
forth
in
a
very
complicated
example
on
page
40
and
page
41
of
their
brief.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
that's
their
claim,
but
i've
analyzed
the
argument
and
i
analyzed
the
example,
what
they
say
is
this,
if
in
a
state
where
there
is
$40,000.00
worth
of
wage
claims,
there
are
are
only
$20,000.00
to
pay
them.
they
would
be
paid
in
this
way.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
i
would
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
in
such
a
case
--
the
residue
would
be
paid
if
we
assume
25%
is
the
rate,
75%
to
wage
earner
and
25%
on
his
behalf
to
the
government
not
half
of
25%
as
they
argue
in
their
brief.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
well,
that
would
be
true
in
any
case
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
that's
correct
your
honor.
withholding
is
based
on
the
actual
gross
amount
of
wage
distribution.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
well,
that's
absolutely
correct,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
the
wage
claimants
is
getting
half
--
the
wage
claimants
is
getting
less
--
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
it
would
make
a
slightest
bit
of
difference.
you
see,
the
government's
example
indicates
that
25%
of
the
$50,000.00
would
be
cut
in
half
because
it's
50%
dividend.
it
wouldn't
be.
it'll
be
calculated
on
the
amount
of
each
wage
paid.
now,
another
reason
we
for
our
argument
is
it
avoids
the
trustees'
argument
but
in
the
administration
expense
mostly
in
the
preservation
of
the
estate
or
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
of
assets,
we
don't
have
to
argue
against
that
in
presenting
it
as
a
second
wage,
a
second
priority
wage
claim.
now,
i
don't
do
--
i've
worked
some
of
mr.
justice
blackmun's
questioning
concerning
the
fogarty
case
because
that
was
the
leading
case
and
that
was
the
case
on
which
from
this
notion
of
administration
expense
priority.
actually,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
fogarty
case
wasn't
correct
because
in
the
fogarty
case,
there
was
no
withholding
as
far
we
can
see.
i
believe
the
wage
distributions
were
made
without
any
withholding
of
tax
and
that
the
taxes
were
actually
satisfied
by
offsetting
them
against
the
claim
which
the
bankrupt
had
against
the
government
for
some
ships
that
had
built.
now
that
means,
probably
that
they
were
rightfully
decided
to
be
administration
expenses
because
they
weren't
carved
out
of
the
wages.
the
wages
went
100%
to
the
wage
claimants.
the
other
came
out
of
the
estate
and
so,
although
the
case
was
followed
in
lines
against
california
and
then
in
the
curtis
case
in
ninth
and
sixth
circuits
which
both
held
that
the
administration
expense
status
was
accorded
to
these
claim.
i
think
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
fogarty
which
was
the
father
of
all
these
cases
is
perhaps
reconcilable
with
our
view
in
this
case.
now,
we
say
that
the
wage
claim
status
depends
on
this.withholding
taxes
are
derived
from
and
carved
out
of
the
actual
wages
paid
to
an
employee
and
the
wage
distribution
paid
to
a
wage
claimant.
there
is
if
there
an
in
envisioned
assignment
by
the
wage
claimant
to
the
governments
involved.
of
that
point
of
his
wages
which
might
reasonably
be
assumed
to
cover
his
taxes,
the
minute
these
taxes
are
withheld,
he
gets
a
credit
on
the
books
of
the
governments,
for
these
withholdings.
if
he
(voice
overlap)
satisfying
his
taxing
indebtedness
if
for
example
he's
made
estimates,
he'll
get
those
withholdings
back
in
the
form
of
the
refund.
so
he
will
ultimately
realize
in
that
case,
what
essentially
his
wages
is.
he
is
required
to
include
them
in
gross
income,
his
income
tax
returns
and
this
shows
too
that
the
amount
of
the
withholding
part
of
his
salary
and
therefore
are
wages.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
it
was
my
argument.
i
say
that
because
it
makes
me
to
appear
to
be
very
veined
of
try
to
support
that
in
the
case
were
i
need
not
necessarily
do
so.
but
it
was
indeed
my
argument
and
the
court
was
very
kind
and
flattering
me
doing
about
this.
part
of
an
argument
also
is
that
proper
segregation
was
made
of
these
funds,
they
would
also
enjoy
a
trust
funds
status
within
the
second
--
within
the
range
of
the
second
priority.
now,
i've
spoken
about
what
i
consider
to
be
the
unfounded
fears
of
the
federal
government
in
the
event
that
second
wage
--
second
priority
status
has
accorded
these
wage
claims.
finally
i
think
i
should
point
out
that
there
is
an
anomaly
in
computing
them,
if
that
to
be
considered
as
administration
expenses
because
administration
expenses
have
to
be
computed
before
you
can
determine
how
much
money
is
left
in
the
state
to
pay
wage
claims,
and
it's
only
after
you
have
determined
how
much
you
have
left
to
wage
claims
that
you
can
compute
the
taxes
on
them.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
no,
your
honor,
i
haven't
and
i
was
wondering
whether
this
was
a
case
of
them
of
the
multiple
variables.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
that's
correct.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
oh,
just
as
the
problem
of
the
employer
who
pays
the
income
tax
on
the
employees'
income
is
capable
of
solution,
in
a
similar
manner.
mr.
samuel
j.
warms
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
will
quit
my
time.
