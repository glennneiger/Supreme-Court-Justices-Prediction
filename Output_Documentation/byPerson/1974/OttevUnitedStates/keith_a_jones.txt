mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
united
states
in
this
case.
mr.
warms
who
would
follow
me,
represents
the
city
of
new
york.
three
related
questions
are
presented
to
you.
first,
whether
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
must
withhold
income
and
social
security
taxes
on
the
distribution
of
the
wage
claims.
second,
whether
the
taxing
authorities
must
file
formal
proofs
of
claims
with
respect
to
these
withholding
taxes,
and
third,
whether
such
taxes
are
entitled
to
first
priority
of
payment
or
are
payable
in
some
other
manner
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
as
to
the
first
question,
the
trustees'
duty
to
withhold,
not
withstanding
the
trustees
arguments
here,
the
law
is
quite
clear.
the
internal
revenue
code
squarely
requires
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
to
withhold
federal
income
and
social
security
taxes
on
all
wage
claim
distributions
and
to
prepare
and
submit
appropriate
information
returns
and
reports
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
to
the
wage
claimants.
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
contrary
to
the
petitioners
position,
the
cost
of
complying
with
these
withholding
and
reporting
requirements
are
trivial.
and
in
any
event,
even
if
the
costs
were
more
substantial
they
would
not
justify
the
trustees'
failure
to
perform
a
statutory
duty.
our
arguments
to
this
effect
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
if
there
are
no
questions
on
this
point
and
in
the
rest
of
time,
i
will
go
on
to
the
other
questions
in
this
case.
as
to
the
second
question
in
this
case,
the
filings
of
proofs
of
claims,
we
believe
that
it
is
also
clear
that
no
filings
of
proofs
of
claims
are
required
with
respect
to
withholding
taxes
that
arise
after
bankruptcy
as
in
this
case.
the
bankruptcy
act
requires
the
filing
of
formal
proofs
of
claims
only
with
respect
to
debts
for
which
the
bankrupt
is
or
maybe
liable
and
the
bankrupt
will
never
become
liable
for
the
withholding
taxes
in
this
case.
these
taxes
arise
only
after
bankruptcy
and
their
obligations
incurred
by
the
state
in
the
course
of
administration
and
not
by
the
bankrupt.
in
this
respect,
they’re
just
like
the
expenses
incurred
by
the
trustee
and
employing
clerical
assistance
to
help
administer
the
estate
indeed
are
just
like
the
costs
incurred
by
the
trustee
in
conducting
this
litigation.
withholding
taxes
like
other
expenses
incurred
in
a
course
of
administration
or
obligations
of
the
state
which
--
as
i
say
which
are
incurred
in
the
course
of
administration
and
the
bankruptcy
act
does
not
require
the
filing
proofs
of
claims
with
respect
to
such
debts
of
the
state
as
distinguished
from
debts
of
the
bankrupt.
moreover,
the
purpose
of
filing
proofs
of
claims
is
simply
to
inform
the
bankruptcy
trustee
and
the
other
creditors
of
the
total
amount
of
claims
outstanding
against
the
bankrupt.
proofs
of
claims
of
withholding
taxes
here
in
question
but
not
serve
that
purpose.
these
withholding
taxes
do
not
add
to
the
total
amount
of
claims
against
the
bankrupt
or
the
estate,
they
arise
only
when
the
wage
claims
are
paid
out,
they're
deducted
from
the
wage
claims,
paid
over
to
the
united
states
and
they
don’t
reduce
the
fund
remaining
for
payment
to
other
creditors.
therefore,
filing
the
proofs
of
claims
would
serve
no
purpose
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
moreover,
any
filing
requirement
of
that
kind
for
the
government
would
be
impracticable.
as
we
showed
in
our
brief,
the
bankruptcy
act
requires
proofs
of
claims
to
be
filed
as
to
debts
of
the
bankrupt,
within
six
months
of
the
first
date
set,
the
first
meeting
of
creditors.
no
taxing
authority
could
comply
fully
with
that
requirement.
until
the
expiration
of
the
six
month
period,
it
would
be
impossible
to
know
just
how
much
wage
claims
in
fact
were
to
be
payable
out
of
the
estate.
moreover,
the
actual
amount
of
the
tax
that
they
would
be
due
cannot
be
known
until
the
actual
amount
of
wages
has
been
calculated
and
distributed
because
withholding
rates
fluctuate
over
time
and
the
effective
withholding
rates
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy
maybe
very
different
from
those
that
are
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
distribution
of
the
wage
claims.
therefore,
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
believe
it’s
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
require
the
filings
of
proofs
of
claims
with
respect
to
these
withholding
taxes.
with
that
in
mind,
i
now
turn
to
what
we
believe
is
the
most
important
and
substantial
question
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
priority
to
which
the
united
states
is
entitled
or
more
generally
a
manner
in
which
these
withholding
taxes
are
to
be
paid
over
to
the
united
states.
under
section
7501
of
the
internal
revenue
code
an
obligation
is
imposed
upon
all
persons
responsible
for
collecting
taxes
to
hold
those
taxes
in
a
special
fund
and
trust
for
the
united
states.
under
that
provision,
withholding
taxes
of
the
kind
here
in
question
or
indeed
any
other
withholding
taxes
are
directly
payable
to
the
united
states
as
a
trust
fund
without
regard
to
the
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
however,
the
trustee
in
this
case
is
not
complied
with
the
section
7501,
and
we've
recognized
that
under
this
court's
holding
in
united
states
against
randall.
the
trustees'
duty
to
pay
over
cannot
be
enforced
as
against
third
party
creditors.
the
issue
that
arises
in
this
case
therefore
as
to
what
priority
of
payment
if
any,
the
united
states
is
entitled
when
the
trustee
defaults
on
his
duty
to
pay
over
the
withholding
taxes
as
a
trust
fund,
and
i
turn
now
to
that
question.
our
position,
simply
put
is
that
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
payment
of
these
withholding
taxes
as
the
first
priority
administrative
cost
and
expenses.
we
reach
this
conclusion,
both
because
such
withholding
taxes
analytically
fall
within
the
category
of
administrative
expenses
and
also
because
they
don’t
fit
within
any
other
priority
or
indeed
non-priority
category.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we’re
supporting
the
judgment
below
in
the
sense
that
we’re
supporting
the
distribution
of
assets
ordered
by
the
court
in
its
judgment.
we’re
not
supporting
the
expressed
holding
that
these
wages
claims
are
--
excuse
me,
of
these
withholding
taxes.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
are
distributable
as
second
priority
objects.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
true
and
you
bring
up
the
point
i
assume
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes
and
no.
we
want
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
didn't
petition,
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
question
of
first
priority
was
opened
up,
opened
up
by
the
petitioner
in
his
petition.
the
question
presented
in
the
petition,
i
will
read
it
to
the
court
--
is
whether
--
this
is
question
number
two
at
page
two
of
the
petition.
assuming
arguendo
that
such
a
distribution
is
subject
to
the
withholding
tax
and
reporting
the
requirements
of
the
internal
revenue
code
etcetera.
should
the
monies
withheld
in
connection
with
the
distribution
be
accorded,
the
fourth
priority
tax
claims
status,
first
priority
administration
claim
status,
second
priority
wage
claims
status
or
a
trust
fund
status.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
don’t
think
that’s
true
in
this
case
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
on
that
point,
i
would
say
that
since
the
question
in
this
case
is
how
the
monies
are
distributable.
necessarily,
the
court
has
to
consider
whether
the
taxes
are
a
first
priority
item.
now,
i
would
say
that
if
the
question
were
not
properly
before
the
court
were
not
presented
by
the
petitioner
then
we
would
be
entitled
utmost
to
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below,
although
we
might
also
be
entitled
to
a
ruling
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
such
taxes
are
first
priority
claims
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
in
other
words,
you
could
if
you
saw
fit
determine
that
as
a
matter
of
law
with
these
withholding
taxes
are
the
first
priority
items
but
that
in
the
absence
of
a
cross
petition
--
we
were
entitled
only
to
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below.
in
this
case,
we
would
be
perfectly
satisfied
by
such
an
affirmance
because
the
distribution
of
assets
in
this
case
is
the
same
whether
it’s
a
first
priority
or
a
second
priority
item.
that
is
i
say,
i
think
that
in
this
case
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
where
the
question
necessarily
is
presented
to
the
court
in
the
petition
and
by
the
question
raised
by
the
petitioner
that
it’s
open
to
the
court
to
consider
it
and
dispose
off
it.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
analytically
there
are
two
separate
questions,
the
first
is
whether
the
issue
is
properly
before
the
court
and
the
second
separable
question,
is
whether
this
court
can
modify
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
in
the
favor
of
the
respondent
and
as
to
the
first
question,
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
issue
is
before
the
court,
as
to
the
second
question,
i'm
less
clear
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
whether
we
really
are
entitled
to
a
modification
of
the
judgment.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i'm
sorry
what
was
the
last
question?
would
we
be
right
in--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
say
and
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
and
we
don't
cross
appeal
or
cross
petition.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
we
present
an
argument
which
if
accepted
logically
would
entitle
us
to
a
judgment
of
$25,000.00.
and
our
position.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
and
we
have
spelled
out
our
position
at
greater
length
on
this
point.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
in
our
reply
brief
in
the
western
edition
case
which
was
filled
last
week.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct
and
it
was
in
reliance
upon
that
we
acquiesced
in
this
petition.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
and
for
that
reason
we
believe
that
this
case
really
doesn't
even
present
the
issue
that
we
discussed
in
our
reply
brief
in
western
edition.
so
we
think
that
this
issue
is
before
the
court
and
can
be
adjudicated
in
our
favor
and
the
judgment
below
be
modified.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
would
be
delighted
to
do
that.
as
i
have
already
indicated
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
well,
in
the
first
place
this
is
as
i've
already
indicated
an
expense
that's
incurred
by
the
state
in
course
of
administration.
and
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
such
expenses
are
administrative
expenses
entitled
to
first
priority.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
these
are
very
much
like
the
expenses
of
hiring
secretaries
to
mail
out
the
wage
distributions,
the
state
really
doesn't
get
anything
for
it,
it's
just
an
obligation
that
incurs
in
the
course
of
administration.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
why?
if
it's
an
obligation
and
it's
incurred,
i'm
not
sure
why
it
wouldn't
be
a
cost.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
fogarty
did
not
devote
much
time
to
-
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
we're
not
relying
necessarily
from
the
reasoning
set
forth
from
the
fogarty
opinion.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
your
question
is,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
you're
distinguishing
between
cost
and
taxes
it
seems
me
and
it's
clear
that
the
taxes
incurred
in
the
course
of
the
administration
are
the
first
priority
items,
whether
or
not
they
are
of
any
substantial
value
to
the
state,
i
would
quote
in
regards
to
that
from
call
your
you're
on
bankruptcy,
paragraph
62.14
(3)
“to
the
extent
to
which
a
receiver
or
trustee
is
under
a
duty
to
pay
taxes,
his
expenses
or
tax
liabilities
are
to
be
classified
as
necessary
costs
of
operation,
preservation,
or
administration
and
within
the
first
priority.”
in
other
words,
these
are
items,
expense
items,
taxes,
however
you
describe
them,
there
are
obligations
that
are
occurred
in
course
of
administration.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
collier
speaking.
there
are
many
cases
to
support
it,
he
addresses
--
he
is
there
addressing
the
question
of
the
whether
administration
expenses
have
to
be
preservation
cost,
and
he
points
out
that
clearly
they
do
not,
that
why
you
are
concerned
about
in
the
first
priority
administration
expenses
or
the
broad
category
expenditures
that
are
made
by
the
trustee
without
regard
to
whether
they
maybe
directly
related
to
the
preservation
or
development
of
the
state.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
like
this
tax.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
why
they
can't
treated
that
way
because
they
were
not
legally
due
and
owing
before
bankruptcy.
and
they
were
not
legally
due
and
owing
by
the
bankrupt.
they
only
arise
after
bankruptcy
and
they
are
due
and
owing
by
the
state
and
you
can't
fit
that
into
fourth
priority.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh,
no
he
was
speaking
more
generally
--
he
was
speaking
more
generally
of
taxes
there.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
of
course
this
court
had
spoken
on
it.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
and
my
time
has
expired,
i
turn
over
the
remaining
appellee's
time
to
mr.
warms.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
united
states
in
this
case.
mr.
warms
who
would
follow
me,
represents
the
city
of
new
york.
three
related
questions
are
presented
to
you.
first,
whether
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
must
withhold
income
and
social
security
taxes
on
the
distribution
of
the
wage
claims.
second,
whether
the
taxing
authorities
must
file
formal
proofs
of
claims
with
respect
to
these
withholding
taxes,
and
third,
whether
such
taxes
are
entitled
to
first
priority
of
payment
or
are
payable
in
some
other
manner
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
as
to
the
first
question,
the
trustees'
duty
to
withhold,
not
withstanding
the
trustees
arguments
here,
the
law
is
quite
clear.
the
internal
revenue
code
squarely
requires
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
to
withhold
federal
income
and
social
security
taxes
on
all
wage
claim
distributions
and
to
prepare
and
submit
appropriate
information
returns
and
reports
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
to
the
wage
claimants.
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
contrary
to
the
petitioners
position,
the
cost
of
complying
with
these
withholding
and
reporting
requirements
are
trivial.
and
in
any
event,
even
if
the
costs
were
more
substantial
they
would
not
justify
the
trustees'
failure
to
perform
a
statutory
duty.
our
arguments
to
this
effect
are
set
forth
in
our
brief
and
if
there
are
no
questions
on
this
point
and
in
the
rest
of
time,
i
will
go
on
to
the
other
questions
in
this
case.
as
to
the
second
question
in
this
case,
the
filings
of
proofs
of
claims,
we
believe
that
it
is
also
clear
that
no
filings
of
proofs
of
claims
are
required
with
respect
to
withholding
taxes
that
arise
after
bankruptcy
as
in
this
case.
the
bankruptcy
act
requires
the
filing
of
formal
proofs
of
claims
only
with
respect
to
debts
for
which
the
bankrupt
is
or
maybe
liable
and
the
bankrupt
will
never
become
liable
for
the
withholding
taxes
in
this
case.
these
taxes
arise
only
after
bankruptcy
and
their
obligations
incurred
by
the
state
in
the
course
of
administration
and
not
by
the
bankrupt.
in
this
respect,
they’re
just
like
the
expenses
incurred
by
the
trustee
and
employing
clerical
assistance
to
help
administer
the
estate
indeed
are
just
like
the
costs
incurred
by
the
trustee
in
conducting
this
litigation.
withholding
taxes
like
other
expenses
incurred
in
a
course
of
administration
or
obligations
of
the
state
which
--
as
i
say
which
are
incurred
in
the
course
of
administration
and
the
bankruptcy
act
does
not
require
the
filing
proofs
of
claims
with
respect
to
such
debts
of
the
state
as
distinguished
from
debts
of
the
bankrupt.
moreover,
the
purpose
of
filing
proofs
of
claims
is
simply
to
inform
the
bankruptcy
trustee
and
the
other
creditors
of
the
total
amount
of
claims
outstanding
against
the
bankrupt.
proofs
of
claims
of
withholding
taxes
here
in
question
but
not
serve
that
purpose.
these
withholding
taxes
do
not
add
to
the
total
amount
of
claims
against
the
bankrupt
or
the
estate,
they
arise
only
when
the
wage
claims
are
paid
out,
they're
deducted
from
the
wage
claims,
paid
over
to
the
united
states
and
they
don’t
reduce
the
fund
remaining
for
payment
to
other
creditors.
therefore,
filing
the
proofs
of
claims
would
serve
no
purpose
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
moreover,
any
filing
requirement
of
that
kind
for
the
government
would
be
impracticable.
as
we
showed
in
our
brief,
the
bankruptcy
act
requires
proofs
of
claims
to
be
filed
as
to
debts
of
the
bankrupt,
within
six
months
of
the
first
date
set,
the
first
meeting
of
creditors.
no
taxing
authority
could
comply
fully
with
that
requirement.
until
the
expiration
of
the
six
month
period,
it
would
be
impossible
to
know
just
how
much
wage
claims
in
fact
were
to
be
payable
out
of
the
estate.
moreover,
the
actual
amount
of
the
tax
that
they
would
be
due
cannot
be
known
until
the
actual
amount
of
wages
has
been
calculated
and
distributed
because
withholding
rates
fluctuate
over
time
and
the
effective
withholding
rates
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy
maybe
very
different
from
those
that
are
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
distribution
of
the
wage
claims.
therefore,
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
believe
it’s
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
require
the
filings
of
proofs
of
claims
with
respect
to
these
withholding
taxes.
with
that
in
mind,
i
now
turn
to
what
we
believe
is
the
most
important
and
substantial
question
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
priority
to
which
the
united
states
is
entitled
or
more
generally
a
manner
in
which
these
withholding
taxes
are
to
be
paid
over
to
the
united
states.
under
section
7501
of
the
internal
revenue
code
an
obligation
is
imposed
upon
all
persons
responsible
for
collecting
taxes
to
hold
those
taxes
in
a
special
fund
and
trust
for
the
united
states.
under
that
provision,
withholding
taxes
of
the
kind
here
in
question
or
indeed
any
other
withholding
taxes
are
directly
payable
to
the
united
states
as
a
trust
fund
without
regard
to
the
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
however,
the
trustee
in
this
case
is
not
complied
with
the
section
7501,
and
we've
recognized
that
under
this
court's
holding
in
united
states
against
randall.
the
trustees'
duty
to
pay
over
cannot
be
enforced
as
against
third
party
creditors.
the
issue
that
arises
in
this
case
therefore
as
to
what
priority
of
payment
if
any,
the
united
states
is
entitled
when
the
trustee
defaults
on
his
duty
to
pay
over
the
withholding
taxes
as
a
trust
fund,
and
i
turn
now
to
that
question.
our
position,
simply
put
is
that
the
united
states
is
entitled
to
payment
of
these
withholding
taxes
as
the
first
priority
administrative
cost
and
expenses.
we
reach
this
conclusion,
both
because
such
withholding
taxes
analytically
fall
within
the
category
of
administrative
expenses
and
also
because
they
don’t
fit
within
any
other
priority
or
indeed
non-priority
category.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we’re
supporting
the
judgment
below
in
the
sense
that
we’re
supporting
the
distribution
of
assets
ordered
by
the
court
in
its
judgment.
we’re
not
supporting
the
expressed
holding
that
these
wages
claims
are
--
excuse
me,
of
these
withholding
taxes.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
are
distributable
as
second
priority
objects.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
true
and
you
bring
up
the
point
i
assume
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes
and
no.
we
want
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
didn't
petition,
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
question
of
first
priority
was
opened
up,
opened
up
by
the
petitioner
in
his
petition.
the
question
presented
in
the
petition,
i
will
read
it
to
the
court
--
is
whether
--
this
is
question
number
two
at
page
two
of
the
petition.
assuming
arguendo
that
such
a
distribution
is
subject
to
the
withholding
tax
and
reporting
the
requirements
of
the
internal
revenue
code
etcetera.
should
the
monies
withheld
in
connection
with
the
distribution
be
accorded,
the
fourth
priority
tax
claims
status,
first
priority
administration
claim
status,
second
priority
wage
claims
status
or
a
trust
fund
status.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
don’t
think
that’s
true
in
this
case
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
on
that
point,
i
would
say
that
since
the
question
in
this
case
is
how
the
monies
are
distributable.
necessarily,
the
court
has
to
consider
whether
the
taxes
are
a
first
priority
item.
now,
i
would
say
that
if
the
question
were
not
properly
before
the
court
were
not
presented
by
the
petitioner
then
we
would
be
entitled
utmost
to
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below,
although
we
might
also
be
entitled
to
a
ruling
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
such
taxes
are
first
priority
claims
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
in
other
words,
you
could
if
you
saw
fit
determine
that
as
a
matter
of
law
with
these
withholding
taxes
are
the
first
priority
items
but
that
in
the
absence
of
a
cross
petition
--
we
were
entitled
only
to
an
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below.
in
this
case,
we
would
be
perfectly
satisfied
by
such
an
affirmance
because
the
distribution
of
assets
in
this
case
is
the
same
whether
it’s
a
first
priority
or
a
second
priority
item.
that
is
i
say,
i
think
that
in
this
case
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
where
the
question
necessarily
is
presented
to
the
court
in
the
petition
and
by
the
question
raised
by
the
petitioner
that
it’s
open
to
the
court
to
consider
it
and
dispose
off
it.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
analytically
there
are
two
separate
questions,
the
first
is
whether
the
issue
is
properly
before
the
court
and
the
second
separable
question,
is
whether
this
court
can
modify
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
in
the
favor
of
the
respondent
and
as
to
the
first
question,
i
think
it's
clear
that
this
issue
is
before
the
court,
as
to
the
second
question,
i'm
less
clear
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
whether
we
really
are
entitled
to
a
modification
of
the
judgment.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i'm
sorry
what
was
the
last
question?
would
we
be
right
in--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
say
and
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
and
we
don't
cross
appeal
or
cross
petition.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
but
we
present
an
argument
which
if
accepted
logically
would
entitle
us
to
a
judgment
of
$25,000.00.
and
our
position.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
and
we
have
spelled
out
our
position
at
greater
length
on
this
point.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
in
our
reply
brief
in
the
western
edition
case
which
was
filled
last
week.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct
and
it
was
in
reliance
upon
that
we
acquiesced
in
this
petition.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
and
for
that
reason
we
believe
that
this
case
really
doesn't
even
present
the
issue
that
we
discussed
in
our
reply
brief
in
western
edition.
so
we
think
that
this
issue
is
before
the
court
and
can
be
adjudicated
in
our
favor
and
the
judgment
below
be
modified.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
would
be
delighted
to
do
that.
as
i
have
already
indicated
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
well,
in
the
first
place
this
is
as
i've
already
indicated
an
expense
that's
incurred
by
the
state
in
course
of
administration.
and
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
such
expenses
are
administrative
expenses
entitled
to
first
priority.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
these
are
very
much
like
the
expenses
of
hiring
secretaries
to
mail
out
the
wage
distributions,
the
state
really
doesn't
get
anything
for
it,
it's
just
an
obligation
that
incurs
in
the
course
of
administration.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
why?
if
it's
an
obligation
and
it's
incurred,
i'm
not
sure
why
it
wouldn't
be
a
cost.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
right.
fogarty
did
not
devote
much
time
to
-
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
we're
not
relying
necessarily
from
the
reasoning
set
forth
from
the
fogarty
opinion.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
your
question
is,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
you're
distinguishing
between
cost
and
taxes
it
seems
me
and
it's
clear
that
the
taxes
incurred
in
the
course
of
the
administration
are
the
first
priority
items,
whether
or
not
they
are
of
any
substantial
value
to
the
state,
i
would
quote
in
regards
to
that
from
call
your
you're
on
bankruptcy,
paragraph
62.14
(3)
“to
the
extent
to
which
a
receiver
or
trustee
is
under
a
duty
to
pay
taxes,
his
expenses
or
tax
liabilities
are
to
be
classified
as
necessary
costs
of
operation,
preservation,
or
administration
and
within
the
first
priority.”
in
other
words,
these
are
items,
expense
items,
taxes,
however
you
describe
them,
there
are
obligations
that
are
occurred
in
course
of
administration.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
collier
speaking.
there
are
many
cases
to
support
it,
he
addresses
--
he
is
there
addressing
the
question
of
the
whether
administration
expenses
have
to
be
preservation
cost,
and
he
points
out
that
clearly
they
do
not,
that
why
you
are
concerned
about
in
the
first
priority
administration
expenses
or
the
broad
category
expenditures
that
are
made
by
the
trustee
without
regard
to
whether
they
maybe
directly
related
to
the
preservation
or
development
of
the
state.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
like
this
tax.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
don't
know
mr.
justice
why
they
can't
treated
that
way
because
they
were
not
legally
due
and
owing
before
bankruptcy.
and
they
were
not
legally
due
and
owing
by
the
bankrupt.
they
only
arise
after
bankruptcy
and
they
are
due
and
owing
by
the
state
and
you
can't
fit
that
into
fourth
priority.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
oh,
no
he
was
speaking
more
generally
--
he
was
speaking
more
generally
of
taxes
there.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
of
course
this
court
had
spoken
on
it.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct.
and
my
time
has
expired,
i
turn
over
the
remaining
appellee's
time
to
mr.
warms.
