mr.
howard
karasik
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
howard
karasik
otte.
mr.
howard
karasik
i
represent
william
otte,
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
of
freedomland,
the
petitioner
before
the
court
today.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
freedomland
filed
a
petition
under
chapter
xi
of
bankruptcy
act.
it
was
subsequently
adjudicated
as
bankrupt.
413
priority
wage
claimant's
file
proofs
of
claim
for
a
priority
wage
claims
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
during
the
six
month
period,
during
which
claims
could
be
filed.
the
united
states
government
and
the
city
of
new
york
did
not
file
any
claims
for
withholding
taxes
or
related
taxes
in
connection
with
those
priority
wage
claims.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
did
not
file
any
proofs
of
claim
pursuant
to
the
bar
order
entered
in
the
proceeding
which
directed
the
taxing
authorities
to
file
proofs
of
claim,
if
they
had
any
claims
for
withholding
or
related
taxes.
during
the
course
of
the
proceeding,
the
bankruptcy
judge
entered
an
order
authorizing
the
bankruptcy
trustee
to
make
a
priority
wage
claim
distribution,
without
the
necessity
for
withholding
taxes.
this
order
was
appealed
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
bankruptcy
trustee
to
withhold
taxes
and
that
the
withheld
taxes
were
subject
to
the
fourth
priority
of
section
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
on
further
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
withheld
taxes
were
subject
to
the
second
priority
under
section
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
now,
the
issues
before
the
court
are
first;
whether
a
bankruptcy
trustee
is
required
to
withhold
taxes
in
connection
with
a
priority
wage
claim
distribution.
second,
whether
those
withheld
taxes
are
entitled
to
a
priority.
third,
whether
the
ruling
of
the
bankruptcy
judge
that
it
was
not
incumbent
upon
a
bankruptcy
trustee
to
prepare
the
w-2
forms
and
related
forms
because
it
was
consistent
with
the
general
rule
that
a
bankruptcy
trustee
need
not
incur
unnecessary
expenses
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
mistake
whether
that
ruling
was
clearly
erroneous.
and
fourth,
whether
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
taxing
authorities
to
file
proofs
of
claim
in
this
proceeding
or
be
barred
from
asserting
their
claim
in
the
proceeding.
essential,
absolutely
crucial
to
an
understanding
of
this
case
is
that
it
is
a
bankruptcy
case,
it
is
not
a
tax
case.
every
appellate
court
that
has
dealt
with
the
issues
before
the
court
today,
has
viewed
the
issues
in
terms
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
has
viewed
the
cases
before
them
as
tax
cases.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case
and
that
if
this
court
recognizes
that
it’s
a
bankruptcy
case
that
it
will
overrule
all
of
the
appellate
courts
that
have
dealt
with
the
issues
before
the
court
and
will
overrule
the
court
below.
section
64
(a)
(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
establishes
a
priority
wage
claim
for
wage
earners.
mr.
howard
karasik
it’s
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
howard
karasik
no,
it’s
not
in
the
brief.
it’s
in
the
appendix.
and
it’s
at
94
(a)
and
95.
now,
this
court
has
dealt
with
section
64
(a)
(2)
in
two
significant
cases.
the
embassy
restaurant
case
and
the
joint
industry
board
case,
this
court
ruled,
decided
that
congress
when
it
passed
section
64
(a)
exempted
to
establish
an
economic
cushion
for
wage
earners
who
lost
their
jobs
as
a
result
of
their
employer's
bankruptcy.
now,
i
ask
this
court
in
light
of
the
obvious
congressional
purpose
related
to
section
64
(a)
(2)
whether
withholding
taxes
in
connection
with
a
priority
wage
claim
distribution
would
fulfill
that
purpose.
i
say
that
it
would
not.
moreover,
in
interpreting
section
64
(a)
(2),
this
court
has
said
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
a
bankruptcy
trustee
to
make
a
prompt
distribution
of
the
priority
wage
claim
dividends.
yet,
if
a
bankruptcy
trustee
is
required
to
workout
the
computations
and
prepare
the
w-2s
and
941s
and
the
related
forms,
it
is
inevitable
that
there
will
be
delay
in
the
distribution
and
again
i
say,
that
any
requirement
that
would
cause
a
bankruptcy
trustee
to
delay
a
distribution
would
not
fulfill
the
congressional
purpose.
and
that
brings
--
mr.
howard
karasik
no,
your
honor.
my
theory
is
this,
they
would
receive
their
money.
if
they
owe
money
to
the
government
on
account
of
taxes,
at
the
end
of
the
year,
they
would
pay
the
government.
they
would
be
clerical
cost
associated
with
the
preparation
of
the
w-2
forms
and
the
related
forms.
i
don’t
know
how
much
that
would
be
and
obviously
it
would
vary
from
case
to
case.
but
it
would
cost
something,
some
clerical
personnel
would
have
to
be
hired,
some
accountants
would
have
to
review
the
computations.
the
amount
of
money
that’s
spent,
might
very
well
eat
into
the
amount
of
money
available
for
purposes
of
paying
out
the
priority
wage
claim
dividend.
mr.
howard
karasik
i
retain
the
accountant
in
my
personal
case
and
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
karasik
no,
all
taxpayers
do
not.
but
most
bankruptcy
trustees
do.
in
this
particular
case
we
have
an
account,
the
accountant
testified
in
the
court
below.
that
he
would
ordinarily
review
the
work
product
of
the
junior
accountants,
and
any
clerical
staff
that
would
prepare
the
computations
and
the
related
forms.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
this
district
court
--
mr.
howard
karasik
it
might
not
have
to
be
an
accountant.
but
nevertheless
there
would
be
an
expense
and
it's
possible
under
some
circumstances
that
the
expense
would
eat
into
the
amount
of
money
available
for
the
priority
wage
claim
dividend.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
but
this
would
be
an
unnecessary
cost
of
administration
because
if
no
deduction
were
made,
if
the
tax
payer,
the
recipient,
the
wage
earner
actually
owed
taxes,
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
would
pay
it,
just
like
every
other
businessman
who
happens
to
receive
a
dividend
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
there’s
no
deduction
for
that
businessman.
mr.
howard
karasik
withholding
applies
to
the
ongoing
relationship
between
an
employer
and
an
employee.
the
government
wants
to
collect
money
at
the
source
on
a
pay
as
you
go
basis.
mr.
howard
karasik
i
think
that’s
the
primary
reason
for
withholding,
unless
the
government
assumes
that
the
ordinary
wage
earner
is
going
to
default
and
not
make
the
payment.
and
i
don’t
believe
that’s
a
valid
assumption,
because
our
--
mr.
howard
karasik
that
maybe.
but
in
this
particular
type
of
situation
that
suggestion
would
be
inapplicable
because
all
of
the
priority
wage
claimants
would
have
filed
piece
of
claim
in
the
proceeding.
the
government
would
be
completely
aware
of
which
people
are
receiving
dividends
and
if
these
people
do
not
pay
taxes,
if
taxes
turn
out
to
be
due
and
they
very
well
not
turn
to
be
due,
because
after
all,
you’re
dealing
with
wage
claimants
who
receive
a
meager
amount
of
money,
$600.00.
if
a
man
who’s
earning
$600.00
loses
his
job,
perhaps
by
the
end
of
the
year,
he
may
or
may
not
have
gotten
a
new
and
they
have
been
hiatus.
at
the
end
of
the
year,
he
may
owe
no
taxes,
whatsoever,
and
i
submit
that
it’s
unfair
to
deduct
taxes
when
he
receives
a
priority
wage
claim
dividend.
it’s
unfair
to
him,
and
it
servers
no
valid
purpose,
the
brookings
institute
report
in
its
study
indicates
that
taxes
collected
in
connection
with
bankruptcy
proceedings
have
a
minuscule
effect
on
the
treasury.
absolutely
minuscule,
but
a
very
significant
effect
on
the
dividends
that
are
paid
out
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
moreover,
as
i
indicated
before,
the
taxpayer,
the
wage
earner,
when
he
receives
money,
it’s
incumbent
upon
him
to
pay
a
tax.
if
he
owes
a
tax
at
the
end
of
the
year,
and
i
submit
that
the
government
would
lose
no
money
if
that
procedure
were
followed
in
this
particular
type
of
case.
mr.
howard
karasik
i'm
just
talking
generally
in
terms
of
the
brookings
report.
brookings
report
indicated
that
taxes
as
a
general
proposition
collected
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
have
a
minuscule
effect
on
the
treasury.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
i
was
just
suggesting
that
it's
a
general
policy,
the
revision
--
the
proposed
revision
of
the
bankruptcy
act
suggested
by
the
brookings
institute
that
the
amount
of
taxes
collected
are
minuscule.
suggested
to
them
that
priority
taxes
in
general
should
be
abolished
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
i’m
further
submitting
that
the
government
will
not
really
be
hurt
in
this
particular
case
if
we
follow
the
suggestion
that
the
trustee
is
making
that
no
money
be
withheld,
and
that
the
wage
earner
at
the
end
of
the
year
if
owes
a
tax,
pays
a
tax.
now,
the
government
has
recognized
that
the
trustee
might
have
some
difficulty
computing
the
deduction,
and
accordingly,
they
have
established
a
bureaucratic
practice
that
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
has
no
basis
in
law
and
not
subject
to
any
particular
regulation
but
there
is
some
kind
of
practice
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
take
25%
off
the
top.
well,
the
withholding
tax
statutes
run
from
14%
on
upwards
and
i
submit
that
in
the
kind
of
cases
we’re
talking
about
where
they
are
all
wage
earners
and
you
are
not
talking
about
principles
of
business,
or
businesses,
or
salary
personnel
but
just
wage
earners
that
25%
is
excessive.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct!
that’s,
that's
the
practice.
but
even
including
social
security
at
5%
and
you
end
up
with
20%
as
the
total
deduction,
and
i
submit
that
the
kind
of
people
we’re
talking
about
might
not
pay
20%.
certainly,
they’re
not
going
to
be
paying
25%.
in
this
particular
case
you
have
got
413
people.
many
of
whom
are
simple
day
laborers.
they
need
their
money
and
they
need
their
money
quickly.
and
to
deduct
25%
off
the
top
or
any,
or
any
specific
amount
off
the
top
is
detrimental
to
them
and
does
not
fulfill
the
congressional
purpose
which
was
to
establish
an
economic
cushion
for
these
people.
now,
the
court
below
spoke
in
terms
of
control,
that
is
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
controlled
the
wage
claim
-
-
mr.
howard
karasik
in
order
for
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
to
reach
the
conclusion,
a
bankruptcy
trustee
was
required
to
withhold
taxes.
it
had
to
conclude
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
was
in
control
of
wage
claim
dividends.
much
like
the
other
appellate
courts,
the
court
below
simply
ignored
the
bankruptcy
context
of
this
case
and
the
point
of
fact,
the
bankruptcy
trustee
does
not
control
the
distribution
of
wage
claim
dividends,
it’s
the
bankruptcy
judge.
the
bankruptcy
judge
appoints
the
trustee,
the
bankruptcy
judge
has
a
right
in
certain
instances
to
remove
the
trustee,
the
bankruptcy
judge
declares
the
dividends,
the
bankruptcy
judge
must
countersign
the
checks,
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
mails
out
the
checks.
so
it
is
not
the
bankruptcy
trustee
whose
in
control,
it’s
the
bankruptcy
judge.
the
government
says,
well
if
it’s
the
bankruptcy
judge
then
perhaps
the
bankruptcy
judge
should
withhold
the
taxes
and
prepare
the
w-2s
and
the
related
forms.
i
say
that
this
is
ludicrous,
that
congress
never
intended
the
withholding
tax
statutes
to
apply
to
bankruptcy
judges
and
that
the
government
is
merely
trying
to
force
the
issue
as
i
will
show
in
connection
with
the
priorities.
each
court
--
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
the
bankruptcy
judge,
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
it
is
only
the
person
who
is
in
control
of
the
payment
who
is
deemed
to
be
the
employer
and
it
is
only
the
employer
who
must
withhold
the
tax
and
prepares
the
w-2
forms
and
the
related
forms.
mr.
howard
karasik
no,
the
internal
revenue
code
speaks
in
terms
of
the
parties
not
the
funds.
it’s
only
the
employer
and
the
employer
is
the
one
who
withholds.
there’s
nothing
to
do
with
the
money
that’s
withheld.
each
of
the
appellate
courts
dealing
with
the
issues
before
the
court
has
come
up
with
--
well,
i
shouldn’t
say
each
of
them,
there
have
been
divergent
opinions
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
to
the
taxes
that
are
to
be
withheld.
the
government
contends
that
the
withheld
taxes,
taxes
withheld
on
the
second
priority
are
bootstrapped
to
the
first
priority.
this
is
illogical.
and
in
addition
to
that,
it’s
not
only
illogical
but
it's
contrary
to
the
holding
of
this
court
in
(inaudible)
case.
the
withheld
funds
are
taxes
that
are
withheld
from
the
employees.
they
are
not
expenses
of
the
state
and
it’s
only
the
expenses
of
the
state
that
can
be
deemed
to
be
administration
expenses
and
would
entitle
the
government
to
priority.
the
city
of
new
york
says,
as
to
the
court
below,
that
the
withheld
taxes
are
entitled
to
a
second
priority
because
they
are
“carved
out”
of
the
wages.
yet
this
court
in
the
embassy
restaurant
case
said
that,
“if
anything
is
paid
to
a
third
party
to
someone
other
than
the
wage
claimant
that
the
moneys
that
are
paid
are
not
wages
for
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
so
you
cannot
conclude
that
withheld
tax
is
paid
to
the
government
can
fall
in
to
the
second
priority.
the
connecticut
motor
lines
case
says,
“that
the
withheld
taxes
fall
into
the
fourth
priority.
well,
the
taxes
here
are
not
the
taxes
of
the
bankrupt
and
the
fourth
priority
only
relates
to
taxes
of
the
bankrupt.
now,
the
petitioner
does
not
concede
that
any
taxes
should
be
withheld
at
all,
but
if
taxes
are
withheld
and
if
the
taxes
do
not
fall
within
the
priority
category
of
section
64
(a)
(4)
then
perhaps
they
fall
into
the
proviso
that
follows
section
64
(a)
(4)
which
says
that
if
a
tax
is
not
entitled
to
a
priority
that
it
falls
into
the
general
unsecured
claim
category.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
the
proviso
that
follows
the
priority
section
under
64
(a)
(4)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
howard
karasik
all
right,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
karasik
it’s
in
the
appendix
of
page
95
(a)
it
says
provided
however
that
no
priority
of
a
general
unsecured
claim
shall
pertain
--
mr.
howard
karasik
yes,
excuse
me.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
mr.
howard
karasik
they’re
not
wages
your
honor.
they’re
wage
claim
dividends,
it's
a
significant
difference.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
but
if
they’re
--
if
there
is
to
be
a
withholding
then
at
best
the
taxes
should
fall
into
the
unsecured
category.
the
government
will
argue
that
this
constitutes
a
windfall
for
the
unsecured
creditors
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
what
the
statute
says
that
the
congress
when
it
promulgated
this
particular
statute
expected
a
certain
“windfall”
unsecured
creditors.
at
the
risk
of
being
repetitious,
i
say
to
this
court
that
we’re
dealing
with
the
bankruptcy
case
and
not
a
tax
case.
when
this
court
dealt
in
the
randall
case
with
the
conflict
between
the
internal
revenue
code
and
the
bankruptcy
act,
this
court
ruled
that
in
the
event
of
a
conflict
the
bankruptcy
act
takes
precedence
and
i
submit
that
in
this
particular
case
if
the
court
finds
that
the
bankruptcy
act
does
take
precedence
and
i
submit
that
it
should
find
that
it
takes
precedence
that
it
will
also
find,
the
bankruptcy
trustee
need
not
withhold
any
taxes
in
connection
with
priority
wage
claim
dividends.
mr.
howard
karasik
no.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
the
only
indirectly.
the
connecticut
motor
lines
case
said
that
if
the
government
failed
to
file
a
proof
of
claim
that
the
withheld
taxes
would
be
entitled
to
a
fourth
priority
but
by
virtue
of
the
failure
to
file
a
proof
claim
that
the
taxes
would
fall
into
the
general
unsecured
category.
but
for
the
general
proposition
that
a
bankruptcy
trustee
is
not
required
to
withhold
taxes,
i
have
no
authority
at
all
except
the
bankruptcy
act,
and
i
request
and
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
all
of
those
appellate
decision
which
rule
that
a
bankruptcy
trustee
should
withhold
taxes,
should
be
overruled.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
if
they
were
no
wages
paid.
mr.
howard
karasik
then
the
trustee
would
not
have
to
file
any
returns.
these
would
not
constitute
wages.
mr.
howard
karasik
these
would
be
wage
claim
dividends,
where
it's
this
--
mr.
howard
karasik
he’s
going
to
be
paying
$600.00
but
these
are
not
wages.
he’s
not
an
employer,
the
recipients
are
not
his
employees.
mr.
howard
karasik
if
he
is
held
--
if
it
is
held
that
he’s
paying
wages
--
mr.
howard
karasik
then
i
would
assume
that
it
would
--
that
he
would
have
to
prepare
the
appropriate
forms.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
the
trustee
in
conjunction
with
the
bankruptcy
judge.
mr.
howard
karasik
yes.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
mr.
howard
karasik
there
are
several
threshold
questions,
if
we’re
talking
about
a
wage
and
if
you’re
saying
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
is
the
one
in
control
and
if
you’re
further
saying
that
the
internal
revenue
code
comes
into
play
at
this
point.
mr.
howard
karasik
the
claims
or
wage
claims.
what
is
paid
is
a
wage
claim
dividend.
mr.
howard
karasik
and
there’s
a
difference
i
submit
respectfully
between
a
wage
claim
dividend
and
a
wage.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
if
he
got
it
several
years
after
the
event,
i
don’t
know
what
he
would
consider
it
and
he
might
considerate
it
a
“windfall”,
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
mr.
howard
karasik
we
attempt
to
do
it.
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
a
hiatus
between
the
date
of
adjudication
and
the
date
of
payment.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
first
these
estate
must
be
liquidated,
second,
as
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
liens
that
had
to
be
invalidated,
and
third,
in
this
particular
case,
the
attorney
who
was
handling
the
case
(inaudible)
he
was
ill
for
several
and
then
died.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct
–
and
that's
illogical,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
it’s
not
my
claim.
the
illogicality
of
that
and
the
fact
that
you
have
so
many
divergent
opinions
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
withheld
taxes,
demonstrates
to
me
and
i
hope
to
the
court
that
congress
never
contemplated
that
withholding
taxes
would
be
applicable
in
a
situation
such
as
the
one
at
bar.
if
there
were
no
further
question,
i
respectfully
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
howard
karasik
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
howard
karasik
otte.
mr.
howard
karasik
i
represent
william
otte,
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
of
freedomland,
the
petitioner
before
the
court
today.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
relatively
simple.
freedomland
filed
a
petition
under
chapter
xi
of
bankruptcy
act.
it
was
subsequently
adjudicated
as
bankrupt.
413
priority
wage
claimant's
file
proofs
of
claim
for
a
priority
wage
claims
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
during
the
six
month
period,
during
which
claims
could
be
filed.
the
united
states
government
and
the
city
of
new
york
did
not
file
any
claims
for
withholding
taxes
or
related
taxes
in
connection
with
those
priority
wage
claims.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
did
not
file
any
proofs
of
claim
pursuant
to
the
bar
order
entered
in
the
proceeding
which
directed
the
taxing
authorities
to
file
proofs
of
claim,
if
they
had
any
claims
for
withholding
or
related
taxes.
during
the
course
of
the
proceeding,
the
bankruptcy
judge
entered
an
order
authorizing
the
bankruptcy
trustee
to
make
a
priority
wage
claim
distribution,
without
the
necessity
for
withholding
taxes.
this
order
was
appealed
to
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
bankruptcy
trustee
to
withhold
taxes
and
that
the
withheld
taxes
were
subject
to
the
fourth
priority
of
section
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
on
further
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
withheld
taxes
were
subject
to
the
second
priority
under
section
64
(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
now,
the
issues
before
the
court
are
first;
whether
a
bankruptcy
trustee
is
required
to
withhold
taxes
in
connection
with
a
priority
wage
claim
distribution.
second,
whether
those
withheld
taxes
are
entitled
to
a
priority.
third,
whether
the
ruling
of
the
bankruptcy
judge
that
it
was
not
incumbent
upon
a
bankruptcy
trustee
to
prepare
the
w-2
forms
and
related
forms
because
it
was
consistent
with
the
general
rule
that
a
bankruptcy
trustee
need
not
incur
unnecessary
expenses
in
connection
with
the
administration
of
mistake
whether
that
ruling
was
clearly
erroneous.
and
fourth,
whether
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
taxing
authorities
to
file
proofs
of
claim
in
this
proceeding
or
be
barred
from
asserting
their
claim
in
the
proceeding.
essential,
absolutely
crucial
to
an
understanding
of
this
case
is
that
it
is
a
bankruptcy
case,
it
is
not
a
tax
case.
every
appellate
court
that
has
dealt
with
the
issues
before
the
court
today,
has
viewed
the
issues
in
terms
of
the
internal
revenue
code
and
has
viewed
the
cases
before
them
as
tax
cases.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case
and
that
if
this
court
recognizes
that
it’s
a
bankruptcy
case
that
it
will
overrule
all
of
the
appellate
courts
that
have
dealt
with
the
issues
before
the
court
and
will
overrule
the
court
below.
section
64
(a)
(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
establishes
a
priority
wage
claim
for
wage
earners.
mr.
howard
karasik
it’s
in
the
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
howard
karasik
no,
it’s
not
in
the
brief.
it’s
in
the
appendix.
and
it’s
at
94
(a)
and
95.
now,
this
court
has
dealt
with
section
64
(a)
(2)
in
two
significant
cases.
the
embassy
restaurant
case
and
the
joint
industry
board
case,
this
court
ruled,
decided
that
congress
when
it
passed
section
64
(a)
exempted
to
establish
an
economic
cushion
for
wage
earners
who
lost
their
jobs
as
a
result
of
their
employer's
bankruptcy.
now,
i
ask
this
court
in
light
of
the
obvious
congressional
purpose
related
to
section
64
(a)
(2)
whether
withholding
taxes
in
connection
with
a
priority
wage
claim
distribution
would
fulfill
that
purpose.
i
say
that
it
would
not.
moreover,
in
interpreting
section
64
(a)
(2),
this
court
has
said
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
a
bankruptcy
trustee
to
make
a
prompt
distribution
of
the
priority
wage
claim
dividends.
yet,
if
a
bankruptcy
trustee
is
required
to
workout
the
computations
and
prepare
the
w-2s
and
941s
and
the
related
forms,
it
is
inevitable
that
there
will
be
delay
in
the
distribution
and
again
i
say,
that
any
requirement
that
would
cause
a
bankruptcy
trustee
to
delay
a
distribution
would
not
fulfill
the
congressional
purpose.
and
that
brings
--
mr.
howard
karasik
no,
your
honor.
my
theory
is
this,
they
would
receive
their
money.
if
they
owe
money
to
the
government
on
account
of
taxes,
at
the
end
of
the
year,
they
would
pay
the
government.
they
would
be
clerical
cost
associated
with
the
preparation
of
the
w-2
forms
and
the
related
forms.
i
don’t
know
how
much
that
would
be
and
obviously
it
would
vary
from
case
to
case.
but
it
would
cost
something,
some
clerical
personnel
would
have
to
be
hired,
some
accountants
would
have
to
review
the
computations.
the
amount
of
money
that’s
spent,
might
very
well
eat
into
the
amount
of
money
available
for
purposes
of
paying
out
the
priority
wage
claim
dividend.
mr.
howard
karasik
i
retain
the
accountant
in
my
personal
case
and
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
karasik
no,
all
taxpayers
do
not.
but
most
bankruptcy
trustees
do.
in
this
particular
case
we
have
an
account,
the
accountant
testified
in
the
court
below.
that
he
would
ordinarily
review
the
work
product
of
the
junior
accountants,
and
any
clerical
staff
that
would
prepare
the
computations
and
the
related
forms.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
this
district
court
--
mr.
howard
karasik
it
might
not
have
to
be
an
accountant.
but
nevertheless
there
would
be
an
expense
and
it's
possible
under
some
circumstances
that
the
expense
would
eat
into
the
amount
of
money
available
for
the
priority
wage
claim
dividend.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
but
this
would
be
an
unnecessary
cost
of
administration
because
if
no
deduction
were
made,
if
the
tax
payer,
the
recipient,
the
wage
earner
actually
owed
taxes,
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
would
pay
it,
just
like
every
other
businessman
who
happens
to
receive
a
dividend
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding.
there’s
no
deduction
for
that
businessman.
mr.
howard
karasik
withholding
applies
to
the
ongoing
relationship
between
an
employer
and
an
employee.
the
government
wants
to
collect
money
at
the
source
on
a
pay
as
you
go
basis.
mr.
howard
karasik
i
think
that’s
the
primary
reason
for
withholding,
unless
the
government
assumes
that
the
ordinary
wage
earner
is
going
to
default
and
not
make
the
payment.
and
i
don’t
believe
that’s
a
valid
assumption,
because
our
--
mr.
howard
karasik
that
maybe.
but
in
this
particular
type
of
situation
that
suggestion
would
be
inapplicable
because
all
of
the
priority
wage
claimants
would
have
filed
piece
of
claim
in
the
proceeding.
the
government
would
be
completely
aware
of
which
people
are
receiving
dividends
and
if
these
people
do
not
pay
taxes,
if
taxes
turn
out
to
be
due
and
they
very
well
not
turn
to
be
due,
because
after
all,
you’re
dealing
with
wage
claimants
who
receive
a
meager
amount
of
money,
$600.00.
if
a
man
who’s
earning
$600.00
loses
his
job,
perhaps
by
the
end
of
the
year,
he
may
or
may
not
have
gotten
a
new
and
they
have
been
hiatus.
at
the
end
of
the
year,
he
may
owe
no
taxes,
whatsoever,
and
i
submit
that
it’s
unfair
to
deduct
taxes
when
he
receives
a
priority
wage
claim
dividend.
it’s
unfair
to
him,
and
it
servers
no
valid
purpose,
the
brookings
institute
report
in
its
study
indicates
that
taxes
collected
in
connection
with
bankruptcy
proceedings
have
a
minuscule
effect
on
the
treasury.
absolutely
minuscule,
but
a
very
significant
effect
on
the
dividends
that
are
paid
out
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
moreover,
as
i
indicated
before,
the
taxpayer,
the
wage
earner,
when
he
receives
money,
it’s
incumbent
upon
him
to
pay
a
tax.
if
he
owes
a
tax
at
the
end
of
the
year,
and
i
submit
that
the
government
would
lose
no
money
if
that
procedure
were
followed
in
this
particular
type
of
case.
mr.
howard
karasik
i'm
just
talking
generally
in
terms
of
the
brookings
report.
brookings
report
indicated
that
taxes
as
a
general
proposition
collected
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
have
a
minuscule
effect
on
the
treasury.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
i
was
just
suggesting
that
it's
a
general
policy,
the
revision
--
the
proposed
revision
of
the
bankruptcy
act
suggested
by
the
brookings
institute
that
the
amount
of
taxes
collected
are
minuscule.
suggested
to
them
that
priority
taxes
in
general
should
be
abolished
in
bankruptcy
proceedings.
i’m
further
submitting
that
the
government
will
not
really
be
hurt
in
this
particular
case
if
we
follow
the
suggestion
that
the
trustee
is
making
that
no
money
be
withheld,
and
that
the
wage
earner
at
the
end
of
the
year
if
owes
a
tax,
pays
a
tax.
now,
the
government
has
recognized
that
the
trustee
might
have
some
difficulty
computing
the
deduction,
and
accordingly,
they
have
established
a
bureaucratic
practice
that
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
has
no
basis
in
law
and
not
subject
to
any
particular
regulation
but
there
is
some
kind
of
practice
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
take
25%
off
the
top.
well,
the
withholding
tax
statutes
run
from
14%
on
upwards
and
i
submit
that
in
the
kind
of
cases
we’re
talking
about
where
they
are
all
wage
earners
and
you
are
not
talking
about
principles
of
business,
or
businesses,
or
salary
personnel
but
just
wage
earners
that
25%
is
excessive.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct!
that’s,
that's
the
practice.
but
even
including
social
security
at
5%
and
you
end
up
with
20%
as
the
total
deduction,
and
i
submit
that
the
kind
of
people
we’re
talking
about
might
not
pay
20%.
certainly,
they’re
not
going
to
be
paying
25%.
in
this
particular
case
you
have
got
413
people.
many
of
whom
are
simple
day
laborers.
they
need
their
money
and
they
need
their
money
quickly.
and
to
deduct
25%
off
the
top
or
any,
or
any
specific
amount
off
the
top
is
detrimental
to
them
and
does
not
fulfill
the
congressional
purpose
which
was
to
establish
an
economic
cushion
for
these
people.
now,
the
court
below
spoke
in
terms
of
control,
that
is
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
controlled
the
wage
claim
-
-
mr.
howard
karasik
in
order
for
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
circuit
to
reach
the
conclusion,
a
bankruptcy
trustee
was
required
to
withhold
taxes.
it
had
to
conclude
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
was
in
control
of
wage
claim
dividends.
much
like
the
other
appellate
courts,
the
court
below
simply
ignored
the
bankruptcy
context
of
this
case
and
the
point
of
fact,
the
bankruptcy
trustee
does
not
control
the
distribution
of
wage
claim
dividends,
it’s
the
bankruptcy
judge.
the
bankruptcy
judge
appoints
the
trustee,
the
bankruptcy
judge
has
a
right
in
certain
instances
to
remove
the
trustee,
the
bankruptcy
judge
declares
the
dividends,
the
bankruptcy
judge
must
countersign
the
checks,
and
the
bankruptcy
judge
mails
out
the
checks.
so
it
is
not
the
bankruptcy
trustee
whose
in
control,
it’s
the
bankruptcy
judge.
the
government
says,
well
if
it’s
the
bankruptcy
judge
then
perhaps
the
bankruptcy
judge
should
withhold
the
taxes
and
prepare
the
w-2s
and
the
related
forms.
i
say
that
this
is
ludicrous,
that
congress
never
intended
the
withholding
tax
statutes
to
apply
to
bankruptcy
judges
and
that
the
government
is
merely
trying
to
force
the
issue
as
i
will
show
in
connection
with
the
priorities.
each
court
--
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
the
bankruptcy
judge,
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
it
is
only
the
person
who
is
in
control
of
the
payment
who
is
deemed
to
be
the
employer
and
it
is
only
the
employer
who
must
withhold
the
tax
and
prepares
the
w-2
forms
and
the
related
forms.
mr.
howard
karasik
no,
the
internal
revenue
code
speaks
in
terms
of
the
parties
not
the
funds.
it’s
only
the
employer
and
the
employer
is
the
one
who
withholds.
there’s
nothing
to
do
with
the
money
that’s
withheld.
each
of
the
appellate
courts
dealing
with
the
issues
before
the
court
has
come
up
with
--
well,
i
shouldn’t
say
each
of
them,
there
have
been
divergent
opinions
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
to
the
taxes
that
are
to
be
withheld.
the
government
contends
that
the
withheld
taxes,
taxes
withheld
on
the
second
priority
are
bootstrapped
to
the
first
priority.
this
is
illogical.
and
in
addition
to
that,
it’s
not
only
illogical
but
it's
contrary
to
the
holding
of
this
court
in
(inaudible)
case.
the
withheld
funds
are
taxes
that
are
withheld
from
the
employees.
they
are
not
expenses
of
the
state
and
it’s
only
the
expenses
of
the
state
that
can
be
deemed
to
be
administration
expenses
and
would
entitle
the
government
to
priority.
the
city
of
new
york
says,
as
to
the
court
below,
that
the
withheld
taxes
are
entitled
to
a
second
priority
because
they
are
“carved
out”
of
the
wages.
yet
this
court
in
the
embassy
restaurant
case
said
that,
“if
anything
is
paid
to
a
third
party
to
someone
other
than
the
wage
claimant
that
the
moneys
that
are
paid
are
not
wages
for
purposes
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
so
you
cannot
conclude
that
withheld
tax
is
paid
to
the
government
can
fall
in
to
the
second
priority.
the
connecticut
motor
lines
case
says,
“that
the
withheld
taxes
fall
into
the
fourth
priority.
well,
the
taxes
here
are
not
the
taxes
of
the
bankrupt
and
the
fourth
priority
only
relates
to
taxes
of
the
bankrupt.
now,
the
petitioner
does
not
concede
that
any
taxes
should
be
withheld
at
all,
but
if
taxes
are
withheld
and
if
the
taxes
do
not
fall
within
the
priority
category
of
section
64
(a)
(4)
then
perhaps
they
fall
into
the
proviso
that
follows
section
64
(a)
(4)
which
says
that
if
a
tax
is
not
entitled
to
a
priority
that
it
falls
into
the
general
unsecured
claim
category.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
the
proviso
that
follows
the
priority
section
under
64
(a)
(4)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
howard
karasik
all
right,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
karasik
it’s
in
the
appendix
of
page
95
(a)
it
says
provided
however
that
no
priority
of
a
general
unsecured
claim
shall
pertain
--
mr.
howard
karasik
yes,
excuse
me.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
mr.
howard
karasik
they’re
not
wages
your
honor.
they’re
wage
claim
dividends,
it's
a
significant
difference.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
but
if
they’re
--
if
there
is
to
be
a
withholding
then
at
best
the
taxes
should
fall
into
the
unsecured
category.
the
government
will
argue
that
this
constitutes
a
windfall
for
the
unsecured
creditors
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
is
what
the
statute
says
that
the
congress
when
it
promulgated
this
particular
statute
expected
a
certain
“windfall”
unsecured
creditors.
at
the
risk
of
being
repetitious,
i
say
to
this
court
that
we’re
dealing
with
the
bankruptcy
case
and
not
a
tax
case.
when
this
court
dealt
in
the
randall
case
with
the
conflict
between
the
internal
revenue
code
and
the
bankruptcy
act,
this
court
ruled
that
in
the
event
of
a
conflict
the
bankruptcy
act
takes
precedence
and
i
submit
that
in
this
particular
case
if
the
court
finds
that
the
bankruptcy
act
does
take
precedence
and
i
submit
that
it
should
find
that
it
takes
precedence
that
it
will
also
find,
the
bankruptcy
trustee
need
not
withhold
any
taxes
in
connection
with
priority
wage
claim
dividends.
mr.
howard
karasik
no.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
the
only
indirectly.
the
connecticut
motor
lines
case
said
that
if
the
government
failed
to
file
a
proof
of
claim
that
the
withheld
taxes
would
be
entitled
to
a
fourth
priority
but
by
virtue
of
the
failure
to
file
a
proof
claim
that
the
taxes
would
fall
into
the
general
unsecured
category.
but
for
the
general
proposition
that
a
bankruptcy
trustee
is
not
required
to
withhold
taxes,
i
have
no
authority
at
all
except
the
bankruptcy
act,
and
i
request
and
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
all
of
those
appellate
decision
which
rule
that
a
bankruptcy
trustee
should
withhold
taxes,
should
be
overruled.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
if
they
were
no
wages
paid.
mr.
howard
karasik
then
the
trustee
would
not
have
to
file
any
returns.
these
would
not
constitute
wages.
mr.
howard
karasik
these
would
be
wage
claim
dividends,
where
it's
this
--
mr.
howard
karasik
he’s
going
to
be
paying
$600.00
but
these
are
not
wages.
he’s
not
an
employer,
the
recipients
are
not
his
employees.
mr.
howard
karasik
if
he
is
held
--
if
it
is
held
that
he’s
paying
wages
--
mr.
howard
karasik
then
i
would
assume
that
it
would
--
that
he
would
have
to
prepare
the
appropriate
forms.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
the
trustee
in
conjunction
with
the
bankruptcy
judge.
mr.
howard
karasik
yes.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct.
mr.
howard
karasik
there
are
several
threshold
questions,
if
we’re
talking
about
a
wage
and
if
you’re
saying
that
the
bankruptcy
trustee
is
the
one
in
control
and
if
you’re
further
saying
that
the
internal
revenue
code
comes
into
play
at
this
point.
mr.
howard
karasik
the
claims
or
wage
claims.
what
is
paid
is
a
wage
claim
dividend.
mr.
howard
karasik
and
there’s
a
difference
i
submit
respectfully
between
a
wage
claim
dividend
and
a
wage.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
if
he
got
it
several
years
after
the
event,
i
don’t
know
what
he
would
consider
it
and
he
might
considerate
it
a
“windfall”,
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
mr.
howard
karasik
we
attempt
to
do
it.
in
this
particular
case,
there
was
a
hiatus
between
the
date
of
adjudication
and
the
date
of
payment.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
first
these
estate
must
be
liquidated,
second,
as
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
liens
that
had
to
be
invalidated,
and
third,
in
this
particular
case,
the
attorney
who
was
handling
the
case
(inaudible)
he
was
ill
for
several
and
then
died.
mr.
howard
karasik
that’s
correct
–
and
that's
illogical,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
karasik
well,
it’s
not
my
claim.
the
illogicality
of
that
and
the
fact
that
you
have
so
many
divergent
opinions
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
withheld
taxes,
demonstrates
to
me
and
i
hope
to
the
court
that
congress
never
contemplated
that
withholding
taxes
would
be
applicable
in
a
situation
such
as
the
one
at
bar.
if
there
were
no
further
question,
i
respectfully
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
