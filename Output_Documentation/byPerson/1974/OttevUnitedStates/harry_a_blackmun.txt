now,
why
is
that?
what
is
the
state
for
--
as
contrasted
say
with
the
trustee's
fees
or
some

justice
harry

well,
i'll
buy
the
obligation
part
but
i
wonder
why
it
is
a
cost
of
administration?
justice
harry

i
think
the
first
priority
originated
in
the
eight
circuit
fogarty
case,
isn't
not?
justice
harry

and
i
look
at
this,
this
was
a

because
there
were
other

there
such
as
the

justice

and
as
all
that
i
see
that
judge
wood
had
said,
is
that
the
taxes
should
be
allowed
and
classified
as
an
expense
of
administration
having
priority,
they
were
not
payable
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed
by
the
bankrupt
and
only
approved
as
and
when
they
paid.
that
is
on
that
actual
payment
of
25%
of
the
wage
claims,
during
the
administration
of
the
estate
pursuing
to
the
orders
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
well,
i
don't
find
much
reason
in
that,
it
merely
says
that
was
paid
pursuant
in
order
of
the
court.
therefore,
it
is
a
cost
of
administration.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
guess
i'd
like
to
know
what
reasoning
then
you
are
relying?
justice
harry
a.

i
think
it's
a
routine
problem
in
either
differential
equations
or
calculus

i
don't
go
along
with
this
argument
and
i'll
be
trying
to
say
that
it
is
capable
of
solution
i'm
sure.

justice
harry

this
case
raises
issues
concerning
withholding
taxes
in
the
bankruptcy
context.
we
took
certiorari
from
the
second
circuit
because
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
were
in
disagreement
on
the
primary
issue.
that
is,
what
priority
if
any
are
withholding
taxes
entitled
to
under
the
scale
set
forth
in
section
64
of
the
bankruptcy
act?
freedomland,
inc.,
a
corporation
first
sought
an
arrangement
under
chapter
xi
of
the
act
and
then
when
this
failed
it
was
adjudicated
a
bankrupt.
413
of
its
employees
filed
proofs
for
unpaid
wages
earned
before
the
inception
of
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
these
wage
claims
clearly
were
entitled
to
a
second
priority.
the
united
states
however
did
not
file
proofs
of
claim
for
taxes
assertedly
withholdable
under
the
federal
income
tax
law
and
the
federal
insurance
contributions
act.
neither
--
neither
did
the
city
of
new
york
filed
proofs
for
what
it
asserted
were
city
taxes
withholdable
under
its
administrative
code.
it
turned
out
that
the
bankrupt
estate
had
sufficient
assets
to
pay
off
all
first
priority
and
second
priority
claims
in
full.
in
due
course
then,
the
trustees
sought
an
order
from
the
referee
authorizing
the
payment
of
the
413
priority
wage
claimants
but
without
deduction
for
withholding
taxes.
the
motion
was
granted.
on
review,
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
reversed
so
far
as
the
referee's
order
concerning
the
federal
taxes.
the
court
directed
the
withholding
and
gave
the
taxes
of
fourth
priority
status
in
as
much
as
it
felt
they
were
taxes
which
became
legally
due
and
owing
by
the
bankrupt
within
the
language
of
the
statute.
it
rejected
the
referee's
argument
that
withholding
and
the
book
work
that
would
accompany
it
were
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
act.
the
district
court
however
ruled
against
new
york
city's
position
on
the
ground
that
the
wages
in
question
had
been
earned
prior
to
1966
when
the
city
income
tax
went
into
effect.
on
appeal,
the
second
circuit
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part.
it
held
that
the
trustee
was
obligated
to
withhold
and
report
and
to
remit
the
taxes
but
the
taxing
authorities
were
not
required
to
file
proofs
of
claim
and
that
both
the
united
states
and
new
york
city
were
entitled
to
second
priority
status.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
we
hold
that
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
with
respect
to
these
earned
but
unpaid
pre-bankruptcy
wages
is
obligated
to
withhold
income
and
social
security
taxes
when
those
wages
are
paid
from
the
bankrupt
estate.
we
so
hold
despite
the
fact
that
an
employment
relationship
between
the
trustee
and
the
wage
earner
does
not
exist.
we
also
hold
that
payments
of
these
priority
wage
claims
qualifies
wages
under
both
the
bankruptcy
and
under
the
tax
statutes.
we
too
reject
the
argument
that
the
withholding
burden
on
the
trustee,
such
as
it
is,
is
not
consistent
with
the
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
we
further
hold
that
proofs
of
claim
need
not
be
filed
with
respect
to
these
pre-bankruptcy
wages.
and
finally
we
hold
that
these
particular
withholding
taxes
are
entitled
to
a
second
priority.
that
is
the
same
priority
that
the
wage
claims
possess.
we
so
hold
because
the
withholding
taxes
derive
from
the
wages
themselves.
we
refuse
to
place
them
in
the
fourth
category
because
they
are
not
taxes
that
became
legally
due
and
owing
by
the
bankrupt.
and
we
do
not
place
them
in
the
first
priority
relating
to
cost
and
expenses
of
administration.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed.
