mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
district
of
columbia
circuit
which
reversed
respondent's
robbery
conviction.
government's
evidence
against
respondent
hale
with
the
trial
in
this
case
consisted
of
four
principle
matters.
first,
there
was
the
eyewitness
identification
by
the
victim
mr.
arrington.
second,
there
was
the
fact
that
mr.
arrington
had
told
the
police
prior
to
the
time
mr.
hale
was
arrested
that
one
of
the
robbers
might
be
named
billy
hale.
third
was
the
fact
that
hale's
attempted
flight
when
a
police
officer
sought
to
arrest
him
after
arrington
had
identified
hale
on
the
street
as
one
of
the
robbers.
fourth
was
hale's
possession
in
his
trousers
pocket
of
a
$123.00
in
cash
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
it's
on
the
latter
piece
of
evidence
that
this
case
focuses
and
that
much
of
the
trial
focused.
arrington
testified
that
the
robbers
took
an
estimated
$96.00
from
him
but
it
was
taken
by
co-defendant
anderson
and
that
he
sought
handed
by
anderson
to
respondent
hale.
one
of
the
arresting
officers
testified
to
finding
and
ceasing
the
money
at
the
time
of
hale's
arrest.
it
was
also
brought
out
that
hale
was
unemployed.
the
defense
also
concentrated
on
the
money
found
in
respondent's
possession
after
the
robbery.
six
of
its
seven
witnesses
testified
on
that
subject.
the
defense
explanation
was
that
respondent's
estranged
wife
had
received
her
welfare
check
that
morning,
cashed
it
and
given
$150.00
to
respondent
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
certain
money
orders.
she'd
written
a
list
on
a
scrap
of
paper
of
the
money
orders
to
be
purchase
which
respondent
testified
he
threw
away
the
day
after
his
arrest.
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
three
or
four
hours
after
he
had
received
the
money
from
his
wife,
respondent
testified
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
buy
the
money
orders
that
she
had
requested.
closing
arguments
of
counsel
also
devoted
significant
attention
to
the
question
of
the
money.
now,
the
particular
questioning
that
led
to
the
reversal
of
respondent's
conviction
came
during
cross-examination
of
him
by
the
prosecutor.
the
prosecutor
asked
him
and
this
is
at
page
4
of
the
appendix,
“did
they
find
some
money
on
you?”
“yes,
they
did.”
“did
you
in
anyway
indicate
where
that
money
came
from?”
“no,
i
didn't.”
“why
not?”
“i
didn't
feel
it
was
necessary
at
the
time.”
“you
were
advised
of
your
rights,
were
you
not?”
“yes.”
at
that
point,
the
court
interjected,
stated
that
he
is
not
required
to
indicate
where
the
money
came
from.
there
is
no
responsibility
on
his
part
in
regarding
to
that.
and
then
in
response
to
objections
by
defense
counsel,
the
court
further
stated
--
indicated
to
the
jury
that
it
is
clearly
an
inappropriate
question.
“you
may
disregard
it
ladies
and
gentlemen.”
the
defendant
is
not
required
to
give
any
explanation
whatsoever
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
court
of
appeals
found
this
questioning
to
be
improper
and
reverse
the
conviction
because
of
it.
now
on
analyzing
this
case,
there
are
two
distinct
questions
which
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
separate.
the
first
is
whether
respondent's
silence
at
the
time
he
was
arrested
was
so
lacking
in
probative
value,
that
its
disclosure
to
the
jury
was
more
likely
to
impede
than
to
foster
a
factually
accurate
verdict
by
the
jury.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
he
initially
interrupted
the
questioning
without
any
objection
by
defense
counsel
to
indicate
that
it
was
an
improper
question.
there
then
was
a
request
that
the
question
and
answer
be
stricken,
and
he
responded
by
telling
the
jury
that
they
may
disregard
it,
i'm
not
sure
what
that
--
how
the
jury
took
that.
there
was
a
harmless
error
contention
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
was
rejected
and
we
have
not
petition
on
the
question
of
whether
the
error,
if
there
was
one
was
harmless
in
this
case.
now,
the
second
question
apart
from
the
probative
value
prejudicial
effect
question
is
whether
even
if
the
disclosure
of
respondent's
silence
was
likely
to
contribute
to
an
accurate
verdict,
there
is
some
overwriting
constitutional
policy
dictating
that
a
preference
be
accorded
to
suppression
of
the
evidence,
even
at
the
expense
of
the
truth
seeking
function
of
the
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct,
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
don't
in
anyway
suggest
that
he
had
any
obligation
to
give
any
explanation.
the
question
here
is
whether
it
was
sufficiently
likely
that
a
person
in
his
circumstances
would
have
volunteered
an
explanation
would
have
chosen
to
explain
that
his
failure
to
do
so
shed
some
light
on
the
truthfulness
of
his
testimony
at
the
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
was
not
obliged
to
explain
it
to
the
police.
he
was
not
obliged
to
explain
at
the
trial.
he
elected
not
to
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
was
asked
the
question
because
his
failure
to
explain
that
even
though
he
was
not
oblige
to
explain
it
was
nevertheless
probative
and
i
think
i'm
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
the
reason
the
money
was
probative
and
was
considered
to
be
probative
and
this
is
why
i
indicated
the
amount
of
the
tension
that
was
paid
to
it
was
that
it
was
presumably
under
the
circumstances,
unusual
for
somebody
in
hale's
condition
to
have
such
a
large
sum
of
money
on
him.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
he
was
unemployed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
didn't
say
but
his
wife
testified
on
cross-examination
that
he
was
unemployed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
right.
it
wasn't
unusually
large
sum
of
money
in
his
pocket.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
it
was
unusually
larger
under
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
for
--
in
hale
circumstances
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
circumstances
were
that
he
was
arrested
shortly
after
a
robbery
in
which
a
similar
although
slightly
lesser
sum
of
money
had
been
stolen
from
the
victim,
that
mr.
hale
was
unemployed,
that
it
was
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
that's
not
--
the
question
is
not
what
the
police
knew
at
that
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
question
is
not
what
the
police
knew
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
question
is
what
the
jury
would
know
in
evaluating
the
truthfulness
of
hale's
testimony
at
trial
of
his
explanation
and
i
think
it's
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
they
had.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
he
was.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
now,
i
don't
think
he
penalized
for
it.
i
think
that
there
is
a
consequence
that
attached
once
he
elected
to
get
on
the
stand
and
to
explain
to
the
jury
why
he
had
the
money.
he
ex
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
sure
why
he
asked
that
question,
but
i
think
it's
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand.
the
purpose
of
the
miranda
warnings
is
to
ensure
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
the
reason
that
question
was
asked,
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
call
to
the
jury's
attention
as
judge
gesell
did
here
that
there
is
no
duty
to
answer
questions.
and
the
reason
its
appropriate
is
that
that's
a
factor
that
the
jury
ought
to
take
into
consideration
in
evaluating
whether
or
not
the
defendant's
testimony
has
been
impeached,
whether
they
believe
the
defendant's
testimony,
it
is
a
factor
in
the
defendant's
favor
that
he
didn't
have
a
duty
to
speak
and
that
he
was
so
advised.
in
terms
of
the
evidence
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
correct.
the
money
was
after
all
at
trial
one
of
the
principle
pieces
of
evidence
against
hale.
when
hale
chose
to
testify,
one
of
the
burdens
that
he
obviously
undertook
was
to
explain
how
it
came
about
that
he
had
the
sum
of
money
on
him
in
order
to
rebut
the
inference
that
the
jury
might
otherwise
draw
from
his
possession
of
this
money.
when
he
sought
to
do
that,
the
question
then
arose
whether
we
could
seek
to
impeach
his
testimony
by
showing
his
silence
before
the
police.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
this
was
cross-examination
by
the
prosecutor.
he
had
--
his
testimony
on
cross-examination,
the
prosecutor
asked
him
whether
they
found
money.
because
one
of
the
theories
of
the
prosecution,
one
of
the
factual
theories
that
was
submitted
to
the
jury
was
that
this
was
the
money
that
was
stolen
from
arrington.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
understand
that
the
fact
of
his
possession
of
the
money
was
already
in
evidence,
but
what
was
also
an
evidenced
at
the
point
that
this
cross-examination
took
place
was
his
explanation
of
how
he
came
to
have
the
money.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
nothing
inconsistent
as
i
think
you're
suggesting
between
his
silence
at
the
police
station
and
his
explanation
at
trial.
we
don't
agree
with
that.
we
think
it's
important
to
inquire
into
what
is
meant
by
the
word
inconsistent.
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
here
use
it
to
mean
necessarily
contradictory;
that
is
that
the
testimony
and
the
prior
inconsistency
can't
both
be
true,
and
they
seek
to
distinguish
cases
like
harris
and
walder
on
the
grounds
that
there,
there
was
that
kind
of
inconsistency.
now,
the
question
is
in
order
to
be
probative
for
impeachment
purposes
must
the
evidence
be
wholly
and
inevitably
inconsistent
or
does
it
suffice
if
it's
probably
inconsistent,
if
it
tends
to
impeach
the
witness's
testimony,
now
we
think
that
the
latter
is
sufficient.
and
in
this
connection,
i
refer
the
court
to
the
definition
of
relevant
evidence
which
is
contained
in
rule
401
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
relevant
evidence
is
there
to
find
as
evidence
having
any
tendency
to
make
the
existence
of
any
fact
that
is
of
consequence
to
the
determination
of
the
action
more
probable
or
less
probable
than
it
would
be
without
the
evidence.
applying
that
standard
here,
it's
clear
that
respondent's
prior
silence
should
have
been
admitted
as
having
at
least
some
tendency
to
show
that
his
testimony
at
trial
was
not
truthful.
in
this
connection,
i'd
like
to
advert
to
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
adamson
against
california
about
this
matter.
it
said
sensible
and
just-minded
man
in
important
affairs
of
life
deemed
it
significant
that
a
man
remains
silent
when
confronted
with
serious
and
responsible
evidence
against
himself
which
it
is
within
his
power
to
contradict.
the
notion
that
to
allow
jurors
to
do
that
with
sensible
and
right-minded
man
do
everyday
violates
the
immutable
principles
of
justices
conceived
by
a
civil
life
society
is
to
trivialize
the
importance
of
due
process.
to
deny
that
the
jury
can
be
trusted
to
make
such
discrimination,
that
is
assess
the
reasons
for
silence
is
to
show
little
confidence
in
the
jury
system.
this
is
an
empirical
question
and
the
degree
to
which
silence
tends
to
impeach
is
subsequently
proffered
explanation
will
vary
from
case
to
case.
here,
its
impeaching
effect
is
high.
if
hale's
testimony
at
trial
was
true,
it
seems
to
us
and
we
think
it
would
have
seen
to
the
jury
extremely
unlikely
that
he
would
have
failed
to
tell
the
same
story
to
the
police.
by
telling
the
story,
by
explaining
to
the
police
what
happen
at
the
time,
he
would
have
capitalize
on
an
opportunity
possibly
to
prevent
prosecution
all
together,
or
at
the
very
least
to
neutralize
a
damaging
piece
of
evidence.
this
opportunity
was
evanescent
if
he
didn't
tell
the
police
at
that
time
where
this
money
came
from,
he
could
never
afterwards
convince
the
police
that
his
subsequent
explanation
was
not
fabricated.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
that
was
shown
in
great
detail.
there
was
evidence
showing
that
she
received
the
check.
they
had
someone
from
the
welfare
office
testify
as
to
one
the
check
was
sent
out,
someone
from
the
treasury
department
testify
about
when
the
check
was
cashed.
it
was
clear
that
she
had
received
the
money
that
day,
and
then
of
course
that
was
her
word
and
hale's
that
she
had
given
the
money
to
him.
now
finally,
a
point
that
i
think
is
very
significant
in
assessing
whether
his
silence
was
probative,
whether
it
would
have
meant
anything
to
a
rational
jury
is
the
fact
that
it
seems
to
me
most
unlikely
that
somebody
in
hale's
situation
would
have
sat
quietly
by,
let
the
police
take
from
him
the
money
which
belong
to
his
wife
which
was
her
welfare
check,
which
was
all
the
money
that
she
and
their
two
children
had
to
live
on
for
the
next
month,
and
would
simply
have
said
absolutely
nothing.
of
course,
he
had
a
right
to
say
nothing,
but
that's
not
the
issue.
the
issue
was
whether
it
was
likely
under
those
circumstances
that
he
would
have
said
nothing.
if
it
was
unlikely
under
those
circumstances
that
he
would
have
said
nothing,
then
surely,
it
bears
substantially
on
the
veracity
of
his
testimony
to
let
the
jury
know.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
they
would
have
given
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i'm
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
he
was
--
i'm
not
clear
whether
he
was
being
booked
at
the
time
he
was
searched,
but
i
think
it's
probably
true
to
say
that
they
would
not
have
given
him
back
the
money
without
checking
it
out.
but
on
the
other
hand,
they
would
have
checked
the
story
out
before
he
had
a
chance
to
speak
with
his
wife
before
he
had
a
chance
to
fabricate
a
story.
after
all,
the
contention
of
the
government
at
trial
and
the
purpose
of
the
impeachment
was
that
this
was
a
story
that
he
fabricated
for
purposes
of
trial.
we
were
trying
to
show
that
he
didn't
have
a
story.
he
had
no
explanation
at
the
time
he
was
in
the
station
house
and
that's
why
he
was
silent.
and
we
think
that
of
course,
he
could
explain
to
the
jury,
that's
another
important
point
mr.
justice
marshall.
he
could
explain
to
the
jury
why
he
was
silent.
the
jury
could
see
him
if
they
believe
his
explanation
that
his
silence
was
not
because
the
story
was
fabricated
but
because
he
was
relying
on
his
rights
as
he
understood
them
because
he
was
intimidated
for
whatever
reason,
then
the
jury
would
discount
the
impeaching
effect
of
that
cross-examination.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
was.
according
to
the
colloquy
between
counsel
and
the
court
of
course,
this
line
of
inquiry
into
his
silence
was
cut
off.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
jury
never
knew
that
he
was
asked;
that's
correct.
i
mean
i
picture
further
cross-examination
would
have
gone
into
the
kind
of
thing
such
as,
could
you
stand
there
quietly
and
let
them
take
your
wife's
welfare
money,
and
then
he
might
say
well,
i
knew
i
wouldn't
get
it
back
anyway,
and
then
the
jury
could
see
whether
they
believed
him
and
when
he
gave
the
explanation.
now,
it's
instructive
here
to
compare
the
grunewald
case
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied.
what
this
court
did
in
grunewald
was
it
looked
at
the
answers
that
mr.
grunewald
gave
a
trial
that
the
testimony
that
--
or
rather
help
her
in
the
defendant
who
was
involved
in
that
aspect
of
the
case.
they
looked
at
the
answers
and
they
said
“indeed,
these
answers
could
have
been
incriminating
if
they
have
been
given
to
the
grand
jury.”
therefore,
under
the
other
circumstances
which
we've
adverted
to
in
our
brief,
we
think
it
has
not
probative
value
in
the
special
circumstances
of
this
case
that
he
invoked
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
grand
jury.
but
let's
look
here
at
what
it
is
that
mr.
hale
said,
a
completely
exculpatory
statement,
a
statement
which
if
true
couldn't
possibly
have
gotten
him
into
trouble,
if
true.
now
also
in
terms
of
prejudicial
effect,
there
is
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
grunewald.
grunewald
involved
the
balancing
as
this
traditionally,
the
function
of
the
trial
court
between
the
probative
value
and
any
potential
prejudicial
effect.
in
grunewald,
in
light
of
the
conditions
at
the
time
with
regard
to
the
fifth
amendment
and
this
was
in
the
height
of
the
mccarthy
era,
the
court
felt
that
to
tell
the
jury
that
the
witness
had
taken
the
fifth
amendment
before
the
grand
jury
was
to
introduce
a
substantial
risk
of
prejudice
that
the
jury
would
impermissibly
conclude
from
that
that
he
must
have
been
guilty.
here,
no
but
the
jury
was
not
told
this
line
of
questioning
did
not
suggest
any
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
this
line
of
questioning
did
not
even
indicate
whether
he
was
otherwise
silent
before
the
police.
it
was
sharply
focused
on
a
particular
inquiry
by
the
police
and
on
a
particular
piece
of
his
testimony
to
with
his
explanation
of
the
money.
under
these
circumstances,
there
was
very,
very
little
hazard
of
prejudicial
effect.
now,
i've
deferred
discussion
of
the
fifth
amendment
issues,
both
because
they
have
been
considered
it
greater
length
in
our
brief.
and
because
i
don't
believe
that
properly
analyzed,
this
is
really
a
fifth
amendment
case.
court
of
appeals
based
its
holding
on
griffin
and
on
miranda,
but
neither
of
those
cases
we
submit
supports
the
result
that
it
reached.
griffin
is
critically
different
because
it
involved
the
non-testifying
defendant.
thus,
it
was
not
concerned
as
he
with
specific
impeachment
use
of
silence.
the
whole
truth
policy
of
the
harris
line
of
cases
was
implicated.
nor
was
the
waiver
concept
of
raffel
implicated
in
the
griffin
situation.
moreover
in
this
case
unlike
griffin,
respondent
had
the
opportunity
to
explain
his
silence.
the
non-testifying
defendant
at
the
criminal
trial
has
no
such
opportunity.
also,
i
think
its
a
little
clearer
the
griffin's
refusal
to
take
the
stand
was
an
invocation
of
his
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
the
sense
that
hale's
silence
was
not.
now,
the
miranda
dictum
i
submit
was
also
not
intended
to
apply
to
impeachment
use
of
silence,
rather
it
was
a
reference
to
use
in
the
case
in
chief.
in
summary,
we
think
that
this
case
fits
within
the
ruff
or
harris
line
of
cases
in
which
this
court
has
rejected
fifth
amendment
claims
of
a
testifying
defendant
emphasizing
the
importance
of
fully
testing
the
truthfulness
of
a
defendant's
testimony
of
getting
the
whole
truth
rather
than
the
defendant's
tailored
version
of
it.
it's
recognized
in
those
cases
that
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment
are
intended
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
do
not
wish
to
testify
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
as
hale
do
wish
to
testify.
on
one
final
note
i'd
like
to
make.
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
government's
position
in
this
case
will
not
have
any
effect
of
encouraging
police
misconduct
in
interrogating
arrested
suspects.
we
could
compare
this
case
with
the
arguments
that
were
made
in
the
recently
decided
case
of
oregon
against
hass
where
the
dissent
took
the
position
that
there
would
not
be
any
impediment
to
the
police
once
a
request
for
counsel
had
been
made
to
persist
in
their
questioning
since
they
had
everything
to
gain
and
nothing
to
lose.
the
court
nevertheless
felt
that
the
whole
truth
policy
of
the
harris
line
of
cases
was
of
overriding
importance
there.
here
however,
we
have
a
situation
in
which
the
police
far
from
being
given
an
incentive
to
coerce
the
statement
are
given
a
situation
in
which
even
if
the
defendant
remain
silent,
there
may
be
some
prosecute
of
benefit
down
the
road
from
such
a
chain
of
events,
so
that
to
extent
that
there
is
any
tendency
here
to
affect
police
conduct,
the
tendency
will
be
to
enforce
the
duty
or
reinforce
the
duty
of
the
police
to
give
this
arrested
suspect
of
free
choice
between
voluntarily
remaining
silent
and
voluntarily
speaking.
mr.
hale
had
that
choice.
finally,
i'd
like
to
mention
to
the
court
the
barnes
case
which
had
decided
two
terms
ago
on
412
u.s.
at
846.
we
didn't
include
that
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
there
are
some
parallels.
that
case
involved
the
question
of
the
inference
that
could
be
drawn
from
possession
of
recently
stolen
goods,
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
goods.
there
was
a
fifth
amendment
contention
that
this
put
pressure
on
a
defendant
to
proffer
an
explanation
of
his
possession
since
otherwise
the
jury
would
be
told
they
could
infer
his
guilt
from
unexplained
possession
and
the
court
rejected
that
contention.
also,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
at
page
31
of
the
respondent's
brief,
they
rely
on
the
case
called
miranti,
and
that
case
has
been
limited
to
its
facts
by
a
subsequent
second
circuit
decision
in
united
states
against
sewald,
450
f.
2d
1129.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
think
that
--
well,
there
are
two
pieces.
we
think
of
course
that
he
was
completely
wrong
in
saying
that
it
was
an
improper
question.
i
don't
think
that
we
would
object
to
the
court
reminding
the
jury
although
the
defendant
has
the
opportunity
to
so
testify
that
there
is
no
duty
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
speak.
i
think
the
jury
ought
to
understand
in
the
context
of
evaluating
a
defendant's
silence
that
he
has
been
given
miranda
warnings.
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
defendant
to
explain
that
if
that's
his
explanation
for
his
silence,
for
his
counsel
to
bring
it
out
on
redirect,
or
even
for
the
court
to
instruct.
i
don't
think
we
have
any
objection
to
that.
what
we
want
is
for
the
jury
to
know
that
we
consider
to
be
a
very
salient
fact
in
evaluating
the
truthfulness
of
his
testimony.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we're
not
contending
that
we
could
put
this
on
as
evidence
in
chief.
i
mean
an
argument
could
be
made
but
much
of
the
authority
on
which
we
rely
would
be
inapplicable
to
such
an
argument.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean
assuming
that
the
defendant
requested
such
on
limiting
instruction?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
for
purposes
of
the
ruling
that
we
seek
here,
we
don't
seek
a
ruling
that
it
can
be
used
as
evidence
in
chief.
and
in
fact
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
cannot.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
when
the
case
arose
in
which
there
were
some
--
i
would
have
to
look
at
a
concrete
case
in
see
what
how
i
would
evaluate
the
consideration.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
can't
be
use
for
the
general
purpose
of
showing
guilt;
that
is
it
can't
be
use
to
ask
the
jury
to
make
the
inference
that
because
he
remain
silent
at
the
time
of
arrest
he
is
guilty.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
no.
with
here,
it's
clear
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
of
a
particular
part
of
his
explanation,
this
is
an
important
distinction
that
i
think
that
respondent
fails
to
understand
in
discussing
the
stewart
case.
there's
a
difference
between
general
impeachment,
impeachment
of
his
character,
impeachment
of
his
general
credibility,
and
specific
impeachment
directed
at
specific
testimony.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
what
we're
saying
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that's
right.
now,
that's
an
impeachment
use
as
i
understand
the
concept.
in
any
event,
we
certainly
contend
that
that's
a
legitimate
use
of
that
evidence.
however,
it
should
be
labeled.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
was
an
objection
after
the
court
first
itself
spoke,
then
the
defense
said
“well,
we
object
to
and
we
don't
make
a
point
of
that.”
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
they
did,
but
the
resolution
of
that
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
of
course,
we
think
there
was
no
--
the
contention
that
we
make
is
that
they
had
no
right
to
have
it
restricted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
but
we're
not
relying
on
--
we're
not
saying
that
they
were
silent
to
their
detriment.
we're
not
saying
that
they
should
be
penalized
for
any
failure
on
the
part
of
defense
counsel
to
do
anything.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
that
was
shortly
after
in
connection
with
the
discussion
of
the
--
there
was
a
request
for
a
mistrial
by
the
defense
at
that
point.
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
mistrial
was
requested
was
this
improper
cross-examination,
but
the
court
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
and
the
court
said
“i
don't
think
you're
entitled
to
a
mistrial
because
i
think
i've
corrected
it”.
of
course
we
think
the
court's
correction
was
incorrect.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
jury
did
not
hear
the
material
under
the
asterisk,
that's
correct.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
i'll
try
to
be
quick.
the
reason
are
my
opponent
can't
rely
on
grunewald
mr.
justice
powell,
said
i
think
on
a
fair
reading
of
grunewald,
it
more
closely
supports
us
than
them,
the
kind
of
analysis
in
which
the
court
engaged
in
grunewald
would
not
lead
to
the
same
conclusion
as
applied
to
the
facts
from
this
case.
with
respect
to
what
mr.
hale
could
reasonably
infer
from
the
warning
that
was
given
to
him
at
the
time
he
was
arrested,
i
don't
think
he
could
reasonably
infer
that
his
silence
wouldn't
hurt
him.
there
are
many
ways
in
which
his
silence
would
hurt
him.
his
silence
would
cause
him
to
be
charge
with
a
crime.
his
silence
would
cause
him
to
lose
the
opportunity
to
neutralize
the
piece
of
evidence.
his
silence
might
cause
him
to
lose
whatever
opportunity
he
had
to
get
this
money
back.
the
silence
carries
many
prices.
the
price
of
possible
impeachment
if
he's
brought
to
trial
and
if
he
decides
to
testify
by
his
silence,
it
seems
to
me
a
very
remote
one,
very
unlikely
to
control
his
conduct
that
the
time
extremely
unlikely
to
put
impermissible
pressure
on
him
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
his
silence
was
not
the
product
of
any
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
obviously,
his
right
to
remain
silent
was
honored
and
even
there,
i
think
that
it's
--
by
no
means
clear
that
what
was
referred
to
in
miranda
is
the
right
to
remain
silent
is
actually
a
fifth
amendment
right.
you
have
a
right
not
to
be
compelled
to
speak.
in
michigan
against
tucker
suggest
that
that
right
is
somewhat
different
and
somewhat
more
narrow
and
it
might
be
more
accurate
if
the
miranda
warnings
instead
of
describing
a
right
to
remain
silent
advised
the
arrestee
that
he
has
no
obligation
to
speak
or
perhaps
that
he
can't
be
compelled
to
speak.
in
any
event,
i
think
there
was
no
real
likelihood
of
prejudicial
effect.
by
prejudicial
effect,
what
is
meant
is
that
the
jury
will
impermissibly
draw
the
improper
conclusion
and
i
don't
think
that
could
be
the
case
here.
