justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
contend
your
privilege
to
put
on
his
silence
on
your
side
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
think
it
would
be
error
if
the
court
didn't
instruct
the
jury
that
it's
useable
only
for
impeachment?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
con
--
it's
your
position
that
it
can't.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
thought
you
made
it,
i
thought
you
took
the
taking
the
position
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
could
not
be
used
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
you
really
are
using
it
--
this
isn't
just
for
impeachment
then,
is
it
--
even
when
you
ask
it
on
cross-examination
when
he
takes
the
stand?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
using
it
as
substantive
evidence
of
his
guilt.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
using
it
to
cast
and
doubt
the
content,
the
truthfulness
of
his
explanation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
saying
to
the
jury
in
effect
the
same
jury
--
if
his
explanation
were
really
true,
he
would
have
said
something
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
saying
there,
his
explanation
is
not
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
were
no
fifth
amendment
--
no
privilege
against
self-incrimination
just
as
a
matter
of
evidence
and
proof.
you
wouldn't
argue
that
silence
and
the
facts
in
this
case
wouldn't
have
been
relevant
or
wouldn't
have
--
or
that
some
proper
inference
might
have
been
drawn
from
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
police
say
you
stole
--
obviously,
you
stole
this
money,
we're
going
to
charge
with
it,
and
he
said
wait,
here's
what
i
got
the
money.
you
don't
think
there
is
some
sort
of
an
inference
there?
