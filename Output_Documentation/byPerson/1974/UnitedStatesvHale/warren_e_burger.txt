chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
74-364,
united
states
against
hale.
mr.
frey,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
district
judge
give
that
admonition
to
the
jury
without
on
his
own,
without
any
request
from
the
part
of
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
he
make
any
effort
to
show
after
this
episode,
can
you
make
any
effort
to
show
through
his
wife
precisely
where
she
had
got
the
cash?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
not
made
a
point
to
if
i
recall
your
brief
that
the
fact
that
no
objection
was
made
by
the
defense
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
ritchie.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
it
not
as
mr.
justice
stewart
just
suggested
involve
some
struggle
on
the
part
of
the
jury
to
listen
perhaps
for
four
or
five
days
to
witnesses
testifying
against
the
defendant
and
then
never
hear
from
the
defendant?
is
there
not
somewhat
the
same
kind
of
problem
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
think
of
any
cure
for
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
uninstructed,
was
unguided
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
action
on
the
part
of
the
jury
then
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
they
have
--they
did
have
the
benefit
of
some
instruction
on
the
subject
didn't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
any
hypothesis
to
suggest
why
given
your
view
of
the
case
here,
necessary
view
of
the
case
that
there
wasn't
an
objection
as
soon
as
the
first
question
was
asked.
did
you
in
any
way
indicate
where
that
money
came
from?
didn't
that
in
your
point
of
view
call
for
an
objection
right
then
and
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
looks
as
though
he
at
least
remained
silent
whether
seated
or
otherwise
until
the
judge
acted
and
then
he
thanked
the
judge
for
intervening
for
in
fact
making
the
objection.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
that
time
from
your
point
of
view
it
was
too
late
to
do
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
a
mistrial
should
have
been
granted?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ritchie,
i
wonder
if
almost
all
of
your
arguments
would
not
also
be
directed
at
the
well
accepted
rule,
but
unexplained
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
affords
the
jury
an
opportunity
to
draw
an
inference
of
guilt,
not
just
an
inference
of
want,
of
reliability
as
a
witness
or
credibility
but
an
inference
of
guilt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
in
this
particular
situation,
the
evidence
of
the
government
showed
that
the
amount
stolen
from
the
victim
was
a
$157.33
and
that
that
turned
out
to
be
precisely
the
amount
of
money
in
his
pocket
when
they
caught
up
with
him,
and
that
the
denominations
corresponded
to
the
denominations
of
the
money
taken,
would
you
--
where
would
that
fall?
would
that
fall
into
the
category
of
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
or
where
would
that
fall
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course,
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
to
be
sure
it
was
a
concurring
opinion
not
an
opinion
of
the
court
was
to
the
effect
that
in
the
ordinary
run
of
the
generality
of
human
experience,
if
people
have
an
explanation,
a
valid
explanation,
they
give
it,
and
that
therefore
the
failure
to
do
what
is
found
to
be
the
generality
of
human
experience
is
something
a
jury
is
entitled
to
hear
about
and
consider.
would
i
take
that
you
would
reject
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
view
on
the
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it
were
$5,000.00
and
then
it
has
been
a
bank
robbery
or
supermarket
robbery,
where
they've
had
that
kind
of
money
these
days,
would
you
say
the
rule
of
law
would
be
different,
$5,000.00
instead
of
a
$150.00?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why?
that
isn't
quite
consistent
with
what
at
least
i
understood
you
told
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
talking
about
the
explanation
at
the
same
point
in
time.
the
only
difference
from
this
case
in
my
hypothetical
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
is
$5,000.00
or
to
make
it
clear
$20,000.00.
would
you
think
there
is
no
more
--
the
government
could
make
no
more
use
of
his
unexplained
possession
of
$20,000.00
than
of
$150.00?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
only
difference
is
the
amount
of
the
money,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ritchie,
you
have
i
think
two
minutes
left
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
frey.
thank
you
mr.
ritchie.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
74-364,
united
states
against
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
