stewart
the
--
in
point
of
fact
he
was
asked
to
explain
his
possession
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
jury
never
knew
that
he
was
asked?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
ask
you
before
you
sit
down
mr.
frey,
do
you
--
what
if
the
trial
judge
had
not
told
the
jury
of
what
he
did
in
this
case,
i.e.
what
if
he
had
not
told
them
that
the
defendant
was
not
required
to
give
any
explanation
whatever
at
the
time
his
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
this
colloquy
down
in
the
appendix
under
the
asterisks
on
page
5?
that
was
at
the
conclusion
of
the
evidence
when
they
were
discussing
the
instructions
to
the
jury,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
jury
didn't
hear
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
true
in
the
griffin
situation
where
the
--
in
other
words,
where
the
defendant
doesn't
elect
to
take
the
witness
stand
at
his
own
trial.
that's
--
the
jury
sees
that
and
is
aware
of
it
and
nobody
can
prevent
whatever
inference
they
may
draw
from
being
drawn,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet,
nobody
has
ever
held
that
the
--
then
you
couldn't
so
long
as
there
is
a
right
of
the
defendant
not
to
testify
at
his
trial.
in
fact
that
the
--
if
he
doesn't
testify
that
the
jury
is
well
aware
of,
that
obviously
is
not
prejudicial
error
or
is
it?
the
jury's
awareness
of
his
silence
at
his
trial,
certainly
is
with
or
without
an
instruction
is
not
prejudicial
error
so
long
as
the
instruction
is
not
that
they
can
draw
an
inference
of
the
kind
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
made
in
the
griffin
case.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
police
--
what
you
argued
and
the
response
for
which
the
way
you
responded
to
justice
rehnquist,
all
these
matters
could
be
brought
out
(a)
by
this
redirect
examination
and
(b)
in
the
closing
argument
to
the
jury,
the
members
of
the
jury
presumably
see
as
many
television
programs
as
your
client
does
or
other
people
do.
isn't
this
sort
of
the
same
thing
as
evidence
of
flight
which
the
general
rule
is
admissible
and
which
could
be
explained
often?
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
objection
goes
to
--
if
that's
valid,
then
the
whole
business
of
impeachment
of
credibility
through
questions
and
which
bring
out
such
things
as
prior
offenses
and
so
on
would
be
invalid,
and
yet,
that's
being
accepted
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
your
argument
is
that
the
jury
will
not
be
able
to
comprehend
the
limiting
instructions
as
to
the
use
of
what
was
brought
out
on
cross-examination,
that's
a
very
broad
attack
on
the
whole
use
of
impeachment.
justice
potter
stewart
prior
offenses
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
and
prior
inconsistent
testimony
not
in
this
context?
justice
potter
stewart
today,
this
offense
would
be
tried
in
the
superior
--
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
there
are
still
some
supervisory
of
power
is
there
not,
at
least
toward
the
federal
district
courts
in
the
district
of
columbia?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
it's
just
a
non-constitutional
error
is
all
--
in
the
federal
trial
is
what
supervisory
power
means.
