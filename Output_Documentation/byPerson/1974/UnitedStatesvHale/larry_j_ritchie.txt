mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
prior
to
discussing
whether
the
impeachment
here
was
really
proper
impeachment
and
i
don't
think
it's
important
to
follow
up
on
the
few
other
points
that
were
just
made
with
regard
to
the
prejudice
that
was
involved.
we
disagree
that
the
fifth
amendment
isn't
involved
here.
indeed,
we
think
the
issue
is
whether
the
fifth
amendment
was
violated
by
the
prosecution
placing
before
the
jury,
this
evidence
of
the
defendants'
prior
silence
at
the
police
station.
the
privilege
gives
the
accused
the
right
to
remain
silent.
that
right
extends
to
both
innocent
and
guilty
alike.
the
reason
for
that
policy
underlying
the
fifth
amendment
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
protecting
the
guilty,
rather,
the
privilege
exist
to
protect
our
system
of
criminal
justice,
the
accusatory
system,
in
which
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proving
guilt.
they
must
shoulder
the
entire
load
without
any
help
from
the
defendant.
such
a
system
represents
a
fair
state
individual
balance
and
that
it
protects
the
individual
from
possible
inhumane
treatment
by
the
government
and
trying
to
secure
statements
from
him
which
could
be
use
against
him.
it
also
insures
the
dignity
of
the
individual
by
insuring
the
individual
a
right
to
privacy.
he
doesn't
have
to
respond
to
the
questions
of
the
police.
he
doesn't
have
to
dignify
those
questions,
those
accusations
by
responding
to
them.
unfortunately,
most
laymen
don't
know
or
don't
understand
the
policy
reasons
behind
underlying
the
fifth
amendment.
the
silence
of
the
accused
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
is
probably
all
too
often
equated
with
guilt.
there
is
that
possibility.
it
was
for
that
reason
that
the
no
comment
rule
was
really
made
a
part
of
the
fifth
amendment
by
the
griffin
case.
if
the
defendant
elects
to
remain
silent,
then
the
prosecution
can't
comment
on
that
silence
because
of
the
danger
that
the
jury
will
draw
that
impermissible
inference
of
guilt.
the
privilege
would
really
be
meaningless
if
the
defendant
had
the
right
to
remain
silent,
and
then
the
prosecution
could
bring
out
that
silence
to
be
use
against
him.
that
danger
is
present
whether
the
silence
is
brought
out
and
the
case
in
chief,
whether
it's
brought
out
in
closing
argument,
whether
it's
brought
out
on
cross-examination
in
impeaching
the
jury,
silence
is
still
before
the
jury
and
the
jury
still
may
draw
the
impermissible
inference
of
guilt.
instructions
just
can't
cure
that
problem.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
that's
correct.
that's
why
here,
the
danger
is
much
more
because
the
jury
would
not
know
of
his
prior
silence,
unless
it
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
them
by
the
prosecution.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
well,
the
--
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
the
jury
by
the
instruction
to
limit
this
to
credibility
is
really
being
told
that
they
can
consider
the
silence
and
that
into
infer
that
the
defendant
is
lying
on
the
stand
when
he
says
that
he
is
innocent,
but
they
can't
consider
his
silence
to
infer
guilt.
i
just
don't
think
that
the
jury
can
really
successfully
engage
in
such
mental
gymnastics
and
understand
that
explanation
completely.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
yes,
there
is.
the
--
and
in
fact
--
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
the
only
cure
for
that
is
going
back
many
years
ago
before
the
federal
statute
in
many
state
statutes
were
passed
of
relieving
the
defendant
of
his
incompetency
to
testify
at
all.
indeed,
one
of
--
that
would
--
the
law
until
the
federal
statute
was
passed
a
number
of
years
back.
one
of
the
argument
has
been
by
some
scholars
and
law
review
articles
that
that
statute
should
never
been
passed
because
this
inference
could
be
drawn
if
they
don't
take
the
stand
when
they
got
the
right
to.
the
statute
itself
provided
that
no
presumption
shall
be
drawn,
but
you
are
correct.
the
fact
is
before
the
jury,
they
know
that
he
has
the
right
to
take
the
stand
and
if
he
does
not,
they
can
see
that.
but
here
--
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
unguided,
they
can
see
--
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
that
is
correct.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
they
did,
but
here,
they
couldn't
see
it
your
honor.
here,
it
wasn't
his
refusal
to
take
the
stand
in
his
trial.
here,
it
was
his
refusal
to
speak
at
the
police
station.
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
that.
it
wasn't
something
they
could
see.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
i
think
it
did
your
honor.
i
can
only
go
by
the
record.
i
don't
know
what
counsel
was
doing
at
the
time
whether
he
was
rising
to
make
an
objection
or
whether
he
just
remain
seated
until
the
judge
spoke,
i
don't
know
what
happened.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
that
is
the
way
the
record
appears.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
that
is
correct.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
i
do.
grunewald
--
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
yes.
after
the
judge
initially
made
a
statement,
there
was
a
motion
to
strike
and
then
following
that
shortly,
there
was
a
motion
for
a
mistrial.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
that
is
correct.
grunewald
itself
discussed
the
prejudice
because
of
this
possible
impermissible
inference
of
guilt
being
drawn
by
the
jury.
there,
a
credibility
of
instruction
had
been
given,
it
was
brought
out
that
mr.
halperin
was
silent
at
the
grand
jury
for
purposes
of
testing
his
credibility,
and
there
was
in
that
case
an
instruction
telling
the
jury
to
consider
it
only
for
purposes
of
credibility.
in
that
case,
the
court
nevertheless
found
that
the
instruction
could
not
cure
it,
that
the
impermissible
inference
was
possible
because
the
evidence
had
been
placed
before
they
jury.
it
is
really
that
placing
of
the
silence
before
the
jury
which
causes
this
impermissible
inference
of
guilt
which
may
well
be
a
bad
thing,
even
where
impeachment
is
proper.
but
in
this
case,
we
would
argue
that
impeachment
wasn't
proper
to
begin
with.
obviously,
one
of
the
rules
of
evidence
is
that
a
person
can
be
impeached
by
prior
inconsistent
statements.
the
government
is
arguing
that
this
case
is
similar
to
harris;
it
is
not
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that
harris
didn't
really
involve
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment;
it
just
involved
the
violation
of
those
procedural
rules,
those
prophylactic
rules
which
were
setout
to
protect
the
defendant
against
possible
violation
of
fifth
amendment
rights
by
police
officers.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
yes,
i
would.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
the
reason
why
silence
would
not
be
relevant,
the
government's
argument
is
really
that
if
the
defendant
had
this
exculpatory
testimony
available
to
him,
he
had
been
given
the
money
by
his
wife.
then
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
police,
he
would
have
told
them
that.
he
didn't
do
that,
he
was
silence.
we
think
that
that
silence
is
at
best
ambiguous
conduct.
he
is
--
the
defendant
who's
just
been
arrested
and
taken
into
the
police
station
--
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
no,
i
do
not,
and
the
reason
i
don't
is
really
two
for
one
reason
is
because
that
the
fact
that
was
under
arrest,
without
mass
media
television
shows,
i
think
it's
common
knowledge
by
great
deal
of
society
that
possibly
the
best
strategic
policy
to
exercise
at
the
police
station
is
to
remain
silent.
at
least
until
he
has
an
opportunity
to
confer
with
counsel
that
is
prevalent
advice
given
by
counsel
to
their
clients.
the
defendant
may
be
confuse,
embarrass,
he
may
fear
misquotation,
he
may
fear
misconstruction
of
his
words,
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
mr.
justice,
there
are
number
of
state
courts
then
considering
this
sort
of
an
issue
with
regard
to
the
tacit
admission
doctrine
that
if
held,
that
arrest
is
a
per
se
rule
indicates
that
the
silence
after
that
arrest
is
not
probative.
it
is
not
an
admission
of
guilt
of
any
form.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
to
some
degree,
it
is,
but
i
think
the
other
thing
that
we
have
to
pay
attention
to
here
is
that
the
police
themselves
have
just
told
the
defendant
that
he
has
the
right
to
remain
silent,
that
he
has
the
right
not
to
answer
any
questions
until
he
confers
with
counsel.
the
interrogators
have
just
told
him
that.
he
is
exercising
his
rights.
he
is
doing
what
interrogators
have
just
told
him
he
could
do.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
--
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
no,
it
doesn't.
he
is
informed
that
he
has
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
that
anything
he
says
may
be
use
against
him.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
he
might
also
infer
that
if
he
is
silent,
he
will
not
get
into
any
particular
trouble,
that
it
will
not
be
use
against
him.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
no,
but
it
certainly
imply
i
think
in
the
warnings,
it
wouldn't
be
unreasonable
for
him
to
get
that
sort
of
feeling
from
the
warnings
that
are
actually
given.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
well,
i
think
that
is
a
question
where
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
does
come
into
play
because
of
the
impermissible
inference
of
guilt
that's
associated
with
that
silence.
the
jury
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
i
don't
think
will
be
able
to
understand
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
can't
go
through
the
mental
gymnastics
in
understanding
this
is
only
for
credibility,
it
can't
be
use
to
infer
guilt
and
as
a
matter
of
law
--
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
those
cases
did
not
involve
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
those
cases
involved
statement
by
the
defendant
which
was
clearly
inconsistent.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
no,
it
isn't
written
into
the
fifth
amendment.
the
fifth
amendment
said
that
no
person
shall
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
the
criminal
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
his
silence
isn't
brought
out,
even
on
impeachment,
then
he
is
being
a
witness
himself
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
these
things
could
be
brought
out
on
rebuttal.
i
just
fear
that
the
danger
that's
involved
here
is
the
jury
not
really
understanding
the
policy
reasons
underlying
the
fifth
amendment
that
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
a
person
is
guilty,
that
inference
may
be
drawn
by
them.
they
are
being
told
by
the
judge
in
his
instruction
--
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
well,
i
think
we
got
a
special
danger
here
where
the
fifth
amendment
is
involved.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
oh,
i
think
not.
in
the
normal
situation
where
impeachment
is
being
used,
i
don't
think
there
is
anywhere
near
the
danger
that
the
jury
is
going
to
misunderstand.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
prior
offenses
and
it's
a
great
deal
of
different
i
think
in
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
that's
right,
yes
your
honor.
the
defendant
who
is
testifying
in
front
of
the
jury,
i
think
it
must
be
remembered.
obviously
is
going
to
be
looked
at
by
the
jury
as
a
person
who
has
a
special
interest
in
the
case.
in
fact,
they
will
be
told
that
by
instructions
more
than
likely,
and
i
think
that
with
those
instructions
with
his
position
in
the
case
is
going
to
be
hard
for
them
to
rationally
understand
any
explanation
that
they
might
have
and
to
feel
strongly
about
it
and
believe
that
over
the
possible
inference
of
guilt
that
may
be
drawn
from
his
prior
silence.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
i
think
not.
in
the
barnes
situation
in
the
recent
presumption
of
from
recently
possession
of
recently
stolen
property,
if
in
fact
in
this
case,
mr.
hale
had
money
on
him
which
was
marked
in
some
way
and
clearly
could
be
tied
to
the
complaining
witness,
then
i
don't
think
he
would
be
required
to
tell
the
police
to
explain
that
the
police
has
possession
of
the
money.
rather,
it's
a
question
more
of
trial
tactics.
the
inference
from
the
possession
is
a
reasonable
one
which
he
can
choose
at
his
trial
to
either
get
up
and
explain
or
to
let
the
jury
draw
the
inference.
he
has
the
advantage
of
counsel
defendant
here
at
the
police
station
doesn't
have
the
advantage
of
counsel.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
it
may.
again,
i
think
in
that
situation,
the
only
thing
that
mr.
hale
would
be
required
to
do
would
feel
any
pressure
about
it
all
would
be
at
his
trial
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
he
is
going
to
take
the
stand
to
rebut
the
inference
that
the
jury
may
draw
from
that
fact.
again
here,
we're
talking
about
mr.
hale
at
the
police
station
where
he
has
just
been
arrested.
he
does
not
have
counsel
present.
there
is
no
--
there
should
be
no
pressure
on
him
to
explain
at
that
time
to
the
police.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
yes,
i
would.
that
view
was
expressed
prior
to
the
time
to
the
no
comment
rule
was
held
or
did
the
fifth
amendment,
excuse
me,
was
held
applicable
to
the
states
in
a
state
case
and
just
--
would
reject
that
view.
with
regard
to
the
pressure
under
the
--
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
no,
that
is
correct.
i
take
that
position.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
oh
no,
i
certainly
have
not.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
no,
it
would
not.
i
still
don't
think
you
would
have
to
explain
that
at
the
police
station.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
the
pressure
to
explain
at
trial
by
the
presumption
of
that
that
exists
when
a
person
is
found
in
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
is
a
difference
sort
of
pressure
than
the
pressure
at
the
police
station
that
a
defendant
might
feel
to
talk
to
the
police.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
at
trial.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
you're
talking
about
at
trial
now.
in
that
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
before
the
presumption
that
arises
from
the
possession
of
recently
stolen
property
can
come
into
effect,
the
property
must
be
shown
to
be
the
recently
stolen
property.
it
may
be
that
the
circumstances
would
be
such
as
somewhat
--
the
two
examples
suggested
by
you
might
raise
that
presumption
that
this
was
the
stolen
property,
it
might
show
that.
and
if
that's
the
case,
then
the
inference
may
properly
be
drawn.
we
certainly
don't
have
that
case
here.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
it's
the
amount
of
the
money.
he
had
a
$123.00
in
his
pocket,
$35.00
in
his
wallet,
a
total
of
a
$158.00.
the
complaining
witness
initially
told
that
police
$65.00
had
been
stolen.
he
later
changed
that
to
$96.00.
there
is
a
difference
in
the
amount
of
the
money.
there's
no
way
to
necessarily
link
that
to
the
money
that
was
actually
taken.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
well,
i
think
it
is
for
the
reason
that
grunewald
was
a
case
in
which
the
court
exercised
their
supervisory
power
over
the
lower
federal
courts.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
that
is
correct.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
that
is
correct
your
honor.
the
reason
why
i
have
to
rely
on
the
constitutional
argument
is
really
because
this
case
is
a
case
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia.
and
as
this
court
has
held
in
the
griffin
case
and
the
other
griffin,
griffin
versus
the
district
of
columbia
and
in
johnson
case,
when
the
local
federal
district
court
is
seating
on
a
case
which
involves
the
trial
of
an
offense
applicable
only
to
the
district
of
columbia,
it
will
be
considered
to
be
acting
as
a
local
court.
that
being
the
case
there
would
be
no
federal
supervisory
power
over
the
courts
in
this
case.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
yes,
i
do.
this
was
prior
to
the
reorganization
act.
this
case
was
tried
back
in
1971.
no,
19
--
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
it
was.
it
arose
in
the
system
prior
to
the
change
over
and
after
the
court
reorganization
act,
so
it
was
tried
and
federal
district
court.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
today,
it
would
be
tried
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
yes,
i
thought
think
there
is.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
the
government
has
argued
that
there
would
be
no
--
but
by
your
ruling
that
it
seeks
there
would
be
no
way
that
the
police
could
possibly
violate
the
use
of
those
such
a
ruling
to
violate
the
rights
of
the
accused.
i
just
want
to
disagree
with
that
because
i
think
that
if
indeed,
the
government
gets
the
ruling
their
seeking
in
this
case
where
a
defendant's
silence
can
be
used
against
him.
they
can
confront
him
at
the
station
house
with
a
very
similar
sort
of
technique
as
mentioned
in
miranda.
when
they
were
discussing
the
police
manuals
in
miranda,
they
pointed
out
that
one
technique
mentioned
was
where
the
police
officer
tells
to
the
accused,
“joe,
you
got
the
right
to
remain
silent.
i'm
not
going
to
take
that
right
away
from
you.
i
wouldn't
do
anything
to
do
that.
but
if
you
don't
tell
me,
you
don't
explain
to
me
of
what
situation
is,
if
you
remain
silent,
i'll
have
to
assume
that
you're
guilty.”
you
can
certainly
see
that.
everybody
else
will
assume
the
same
thing.
that
sort
of
statement
by
the
police
was
viewed
in
miranda
as
amounting
to
a
form
of
psychological
coercion,
and
i
think
it
does.
if
the
government
seeks
against
the
rule
they
seek
today,
then
the
police
could
properly
tell
the
accused
that,
would
be
a
proper
statement
to
give.
that
would
result
in
a
great
deal
of
pressure
being
placed
on
the
defendant's
right
to
remain
silent
at
the
police
station.
he
can
invoke
that
right
to
remain
silent,
only
on
the
condition
that
it
may
be
use
in
evidence
against
him
and
impeachment.
it
seems
to
me
that
puts
a
great
deal
of
pressure
on
him
to
talk,
to
give
up
his
right
to
remain
silent.
it
does
result
in
a
cost
at
exact
cause
on
the
privilege.
i
think
the
government
in
the
relying
on
williams
and
mcgautha
and
barnes,
really
overlooks
the
fact
that
in
those
cases
where
trial
tactics
was
often
discussed,
the
defendant
had
counsel.
here,
the
defendant
is
just
been
arrested
at
the
police
station.
he
did
not
have
counsel.
this
was
in
a
question
of
trial
tactics
on
his
part.
he
didn't
have
counsel.
he
didn't
have
any
idea,
yet
maybe
what
his
defense
would
be
he
hadn't
conferred
with
counsel.
i
think
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
this
case
and
between
with
the
cases
of
mcgautha
and
williams
and
barnes.
as
far
as
waiver
is
concerned,
the
government
argues
that
by
taking
the
stand,
he
waived
his
right
to
remain
silent.
in
a
single
proceeding
obviously,
taking
the
stand
will
waive
the
right
to
remain
silent.
he
must
answer
the
questions.
he
must
not
evade
questions
directed
to
him
by
the
prosecution.
if
he
does,
then
the
jury
could
possibly
infer
guilt
and
maybe
rightly
so.
but
here,
we're
talking
about
two
separate
proceedings;
the
right
to
remain
silent
at
the
time
of
arrest
and
the
right
to
remain
silent
as
his
trial.
there
is
no
reason
for
the
waiver
about
taking
the
stand
to
be
a
retroactive
waiver.
in
the
raffel
case
which
is
relied
on
black
counsel,
the
only
basis
which
was
suggested
for
extending
this
scope
of
the
waiver
are
against
extending
the
scope
of
the
waiver
was
the
possible
pressure
on
the
defendant
to
testify
this
first
trial.
the
court
rejected
that
because
that
pressure
really
wouldn't
exist.
he
wouldn't
be
expected
to
have
a
second
trial.
he
couldn't
anticipate
that
he
would
get
a
mistrial.
here
on
the
other
hand
at
the
police
station,
he
may
well
expect
to
have
a
trial.
he
is
probably
looking
forward
to
one.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would.
i
think
raffel
as
been
limited
to
its
facts
pretty
much
by
more
recent
cases
by
stewart
in
particular.
grunewald
and
stewart,
both
fail
to
follow
raffel.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
they
did
not
overrule
it.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
that
is
correct.
mr.
larry
j.
ritchie
that
is
correct
sir.
thank
you.
