the
condition

justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
was
silent.
justice

--

rights
weren't
you?
why
did
he
ask

question?
justice
thurgood

is
it
not
the
question
that
once
you
give
miranda
warnings
you
can
do
anything
you
want
then?
is
that
why
he
ask
that
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
asked
the
witness,
he
said
but
you
were
given
the
warnings
weren't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
not
--
as
i
remember
the
record,
they
asked
him
where
you
search
at
the
time
you
were
pick
up
and
he
said
no.
when
were
you
and
he
said
when
i
got
to
the
precinct,
when
he
got
the
precinct,
what
happened?
they
search
me.
it
was
--
that
was
doing
that
part
that
his
testimony
was
in
the
part
about
the
$45.00
and
$1.00
bill.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
already
an
evidenced
from
the
police,
wasn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
telling
us
that
if
he
just
said
that
was
my
wife's
money,
they
have
to
given
that
back
to
him
and
instead
to
move?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
really
mean
that
he
was
ready
being
booked.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
been
search,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
already
being
booked.
justice
thurgood
marshall
also,
made
a
motion
to
strike.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
made
a
motion
to
strike.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
at
bench?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
left
that
one
point;
it
did
make
a
motion
to
strike.
what
did
you
see
that
in
the
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
mistrial.
now
both
were
denied.
justice
thurgood
marshall
once
you
given
up
more
than
you
have
to,
in
this
case,
i
would
assume
that
you
take
position
that
that
small
amount
of
money
he
had,
he
had
no
one
obligation
to
do
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
have
him
abandon
that
that
holds.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
government
sought
reinstatement
of
respondent's
conviction
for
robbery
on
the
ground
that
since
respondent
chose
to
testify
in
his
own
behalf
that
it
was
permissible
to
impeach
his
credibility
by
providing
that
he
had
chosen
to
remain
silent
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
respondent's
silence
during
police
interrogation
lack
significant
probative
value
and
under
these
circumstances,
any
reference
to
his
silence
carried
with
it
an
intolerably
prejudicial
impact.
looking
through
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
we
hold
that
the
fault
--
failure
of
respondent
who
had
just
been
given
miranda
warnings
to
respond
during
custodial
interrogation
to
inquiry
about
money
in
his
possession
can
as
easily
connote
reliance
on
the
right
to
remain
silent
as
to
support
an
inference
that
his
trial
testimony
was
a
later
fabrication.
additionally,
we
find
no
indication
that
the
respondent's
prior
silence
was
so
clearly
inconsistent
with
his
trial
testimony
as
to
warrant
admission
into
evidence
of
his
silence
as
a
prior
inconsistent
statement.
in
view
of
the
strong
potential
for
prejudice
from
admission
of
the
evidence,
a
mistrial
should
have
been
granted.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
douglas,
and
mr.
justice
white
have
filed
separate
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
concurred
in
the
result.
