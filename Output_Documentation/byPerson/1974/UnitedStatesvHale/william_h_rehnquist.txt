justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
the
fact
that
money
was
stolen
rather
than
a
watch
or
package
of
cigarettes
that
makes
a
question
about
money
relevant
whereas
a
question
about
a
watch
or
cigarettes
might
not
have
been.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
hornbooks,
i
think,
are
solidly
against
you
on
that
point,
absent
fifth
amendment
considerations.
there
may
be
any
reasons
that
may
be
advanced
by
the
defendant
after
the
evidence
is
adduce
as
to
why
it
isn't
inconsistent.
but
it
tends
to
prove
that,
at
least
it
arguably
proves
that,
and
as
long
as
it
arguably
proves
that
that's
all
you
need
to
get
it
into
the
evidence.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
that
in
the
context
to
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
fact
that
he
was
told
he
could
do
it,
doesn't
mean
that
he
is
totally
has
to
do
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
both
of
which
are
true
and
both
of
which
were
relied
on
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
his
inference
certainly,
that's
nothing
that
the
police
told
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
its
at
best
of
implication,
why
isn't
the
best
way
to
handle
it
as
an
evidentiary
matter
to
say
that
he
can
adduce
that
on
redirect.
in
other
words,
the
government
shows
silence,
he
comes
back
and
says
it
was
only
natural;
i
was
scared,
i
thought
maybe
i
should
have
remained
silent.
why
not
treated
as
a
factual
issue
one
that
rather
the
one
depends
on
privilege?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
you're
saying
harris
and
walden
or
walder
and
oregon
against
hass
are
wrong
because
that's
exactly
what
the
jury
was
told
to
meet
you
those
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
involve
the
statement
that
was
made
in
violation
of
the
miranda
rules
which
you
describe
as
prophylactic
and
not
part
of
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
are
those
rules
any
less
at
par
of
the
fifth
amendment
than
the
griffin
holding
that
comment
violates
it?
i
mean
that
isn't
written
into
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
still
true
with
the
d.c.
court
reorganization
act,
do
you
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
court
reorganization;
that
was
1970.
