justice
lewis

powell,

mr.
ritchie,
in
light
of
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
grunewald,
is
it
necessary
for
you
to
rely
as
strongly
as
you
do
on
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
was
not
a
constitutional
decision.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
the
four
dissenting
justices
would
have
made
it
a
constitutional
holding.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
the
majority
decision
really
tend
as
i
read
it
on
the
question
whether
or
not
the
evidence
had
probative
value
in
light
of
the
fifth
amendment?
