justice

f.
powell,

now
if
it

privately
owned
your
position
would
be
the
same?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now
there
is
a
statement
in
the
supreme
court
of
washington's
opinion
to
the
affect
that
if
privately
owned
land
had
been
fenced
then
there
would
have
been
no
question
of
the
right
of
that
private
owner
to
forbid
indians
from
hunting
on
it.
is
that
law
of
washington
and
the
united
states?
do
you
agree
with
that?
