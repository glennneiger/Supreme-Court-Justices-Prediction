are
those
lands,
mr.
morisset,
are
they
subject
to
taxation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
state
of
washington
makes
no
point
about
-â€“
they
are
just
tax
free?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
property
taxes?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
your
answer
to
my
question
about
taxability
is
based
on
the
trust
land
aspect
rather
than
only
agreement,
which
provided
for
tax
exemption?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
morisset,
well
we've
to
interrupt
you.
let
me
ask
you
another
question
or
two,
mrs.
antoine
was
also
convicted?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
she
has
a
full
blooded
indian?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
not
a
member,
not
an
enrolled
member
of
the
tribe?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
raise
any
question
about
her
conviction
as
such
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
there
maybe
something
in
the
record
as
distinguished
from
the
printed
appendix,
but
i
look
at
the
findings
on
page
12
of
the
appendix,
the
findings
entered
by
judge
tennis,
the
only
place
in
those
claims.
as
i
find
a
reference
to
irene
antoine
is
in
the
title,
all
the
way
down
through
the
rest
of
it,
references
only
to
alexander
antoine,
so
i
ask
whether
--
what
the
situation
is
as
to
i
read.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(voice
overlap)
this
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
i
find
no
findings
or
conclusions
that
in
effect
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
find
her
guilty
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
making
no
point
to
this?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this,
of
course,
is
my
point
throughout.
i
find
no
reference
whatsoever
to
i
read
and
i
am
curious
is
to
why
you
haven't
treated
this
as
a
point
of
deficiency
in
the
judgment
of
conviction?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
if
you
do
that,
she
is
stuck
if
you
don't
raise
the
secondary
point
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
any
event,
my
question
shall
be
regarded
as
to
state
counsel
and
perhaps
he
can
explain
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
this
is
the
first
time
you
have
made
reference
to
ratification
and
you
are
relying
on
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
before
you
made
the
reference
only
to
the
appropriations?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but,
if
he
doesn't
win
here,
what
happens
to
her?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
take
it
from
your
remarks
that
you
are
doubtful
on
the
part
of
the
state
as
to
the
integrity
of
this
judgment
against
her?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
judgment
anyway.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
any
event
i
take
that
you
are
--
you
share
my
concern
anyway
about
the
integrity
of
the
judgment
against
her
and
almost
concede
that
so
far
as
she
is
concerned
the
reversal
is
indicated.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(inaudible)
and
if
you
look
at
the
index,
don't
do
it
now,
but
in
the
index
page
references,
i
think
without
exception
are
all
wrong.
so
that
the
index
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
the
tables
of
authority
is
useless
and
i
suggest
that
you
call
is
to
the
state
printer's
attention.
