mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
wish
to
first
advice
the
court
that
i
am
appearing
here
today
of
behalf
of
the
prosecuting
attorney
of
ferry
county
in
as
much
as
mr.
morrisset
and
i
tried
the
case,
i
was
appointed
as
a
special
deputy
prosecuting
attorney
to
handle
the
matter.
there
was
a
question
raised
by
justice
blackmun
i
believe,
regarding
the
status
of
mrs.
irene
antoine
and
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
trial
of
the
case,
as
is
reflected
in
the
statement
of
facts,
page
5,
that
only
mr.
alexander
antoine
was
present
at
the
trial.
now
the
findings,
the
argument
and
the
findings
referred
to
by
justice
blackmun
were
therefore
indicate
that
mrs.
antoine
is
not
a
party
to
the
case.
i
cannot
comment
upon
the
reasons
why
she
has
been
added
in
this
appeal
and
as
much
as
the
appellants
have
done
so.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes,
i
presume
so.
i
did
not
prepare
the
judgment,
you
will
note
the
prosecuting
attorney
prepared
the
judgment
and
i
was
simply
sent
a
copy
and
i
was
unaware
until
the
court
had
signed
the
order.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
in
my
opinion
a
non-enrolled
member
of
an
indian
tribe,
in
this
particular
case,
a
canadian
indian
is
fully
amenable
to
state
law
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
any
other
non-member
or
non-indian
might
be.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
i
believe
that
it
would
logically
follow
assuming
her
status
is
as
is
stated
in
the
united
states'
memorandum
as
amicus
curiae,
that
is
a
non-enrolled
member
or
a
native
indian
--
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
the
original
charges
were
filed
against
both
mr.
and
mrs.
antoine.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
that
she
was
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
--
there
were
originally
two
charges
filed,
one
was
dismissed
by
stipulation.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes
and
in
as
much
as
these
matters
are
misdemeanors
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
washington,
the
statute
limitations
would
have
run.
so,
as
a
matter
of
reality
there
would
be
--
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
she
is
out
of
trouble
as
far
as
i
can
say,
because
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
any
event.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
if
he
does
not
win
here?
as
far
as
i
can
see
that
she
is
not
proper
--
she
was
not
present
in
the
judgment
entered
by
the
lower
court,
could
be
reopened
i
believe
on
that
ground.
however
again,
and
i
would
iterate
that
i
did
not
prepare
or
enter
the
judgment
which
is
found
in
the
appendix.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
as
to
mrs.
antoine,
yes.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes,
because
the
statement
of
facts
does
reflect
that
she
was
not
present
at
the
trial.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes,
i
would
submit
that
may
would
be
the
case
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
with
regard
to
the
--
my
respondent.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
with
regard
to
the
statute
of
limitations?
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes,
first
i
of
all,
i
would
question
the
jurisdiction
of
the
trial
court
in
the
first
instance
to
enter
any
sort
of
a
judgment
and
sentence
upon
an
individual
who
was
not
present.
the
appropriate
remedy
would
be
under
those
circumstances
i
believe
to
issue
bench
warrant
in
the
event
that
the
person
did
not
appear
for
trial.
unless
her
attorney
might
have
waived
her
presence
as
is
reflected
apparently
by
stipulation
of
mr.
morisset
and
the
local
prosecuting
attorney
granville
egan.
i
was
not
again,
i
am
somewhat
handicapped
on
these
detailed
questions
with
regard
to
the
entry
of
the
judgment
sentence
and
as
much
as
i
was
not
present
at
that
time
and
did
not
draft
them.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
in
as
much
as
the
court
in
the
first
instance
might
well
lack
jurisdiction
because
of
her
failure
to
have
appeared
in
the
case.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes,
i
would
presume
that
would
be
true.
however,
i
was
of
the
impression
that
justice
blackmun
wanted
to
have
whatever
information
my
comments,
and
whatever
information
was
available
from
the
record
directed
his
attention.
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
i
shifted
gears
so
to
speak
and
attempted
to
address
myself
to
that
problem.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
the
status
of
mrs.
antoine?
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
no,
they
did
not
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
the
appellants
did
not
raise
the
question,
and
did
not,
it
was
not
argued
by
appellants
and
i
believe
that
counsel
for
appellants
has
so
indicated.
i
am
simply
trying
be
candid
with
the
court
and
advise
the
court
of
the
exact
record
that
is
before
it.
i
would
point
out
in
further
response
to
the
question
of
justice
marshall,
that
in
the
single
appendix
printed
by
appellants,
page
16
wherein
the
findings
are
set
forth
that
it's
recited
that
each
defendant
personally,
their
attorney
mason
d.
morisset
and
the
assistant
attorney
general
and
the
prosecuting
attorney
all
have
stipulated
and
so
forth,
that
the
sentence
was
of
the
district
court,
the
lower
court
below
the
superior
court
was
reasonable
and
so
forth.
alright,
i
am
not
sure
that.
adds
or
subtracts
to
her
absence
at
the
trial.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
to
the
court,
as
has
been
referred
to
by
mr.
morisset,
that
the
status
of
the
lands
upon
which
the
arrest
occurs,
with
that
of
non-alloted
lands,
they
were
not
indian
lands,
they
were
in
non-indian
ownership.
they
are
fully
subject
to
state
taxation
and
even
if
the
owner
of
those
lands
would
engage
in
the
activity
of
hunting,
he
would
required
to
possess
a
state
hunting
license.
so,
as
i
understand
--
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes
that
is
correct,
and
the
owner
of
the
land
would
likewise
have
to
comply
with
that
hunting
season
regulation
which
was
promulgated
by
the
game
commission
of
the
state
of
washington
pursuant
to
statutory
delegation
by
the
legislature.
the
first
point
that
i
believe
should
be
briefly
discussed
involves
the
1871
statute
prohibiting
the
execution
of
further
treaties.
and
in
light
of
this
statute,
i
believe
that
the
court
must
examine
very
carefully
the
legal
consequences
which
might
arguably
flow
from
the
1891
agreement
with
the
tribes
and
bands
of
colville
indian
reservation.
i
would
first
point
out
to
the
court,
that
as
pointed
out
by
the
court
below,
that
a
plausible
interpretation
of
the
exact
language
before
the
court
in
articles
1,
5,
6
of
the
1891
agreement
is
that,
article
6
was
intended
to
secure
to
the
indian
allottees
in
the
northern
half,
the
rights
to
go
upon
the
indian
reservation
and
hunt
in
common
with
the
indians
on
the
diminished
or
south
half
of
the
reservation.
this
is
further
borne
out
by
the
exact
language
used
by
the
commissioners
who
represented
the
united
states
when
entering
into
these
negotiations
in
article
1,
whereby
the
indians
“do
hereby
surrender
and
relinquish
to
the
united
states
all
their
right,
titles,
claim
and
interest
in
and
to
and
over
the
following
described
tract
of
land.
secondly,
as
pointed
out
in
the
briefs
filed
by
the
united
states
as
amicus
curiae,
and
in
the
statutes
pointed
out
by
the
appellants
in
their
briefs,
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
that
the
commissioners
of
the
united
states
had
any
authority
to
enter
into
a
treaty
or
even
that,
that
was
what
they
intended
to
accomplish.
rather
it
would
--
the
statute
authorizing
the
commissioners
to
enter
into
these
negotiations
indicate
that
their
purpose
was
to
acquire
the
land.
so,
that
it
might
be
open
for
public
settlement.
this
matter
was
further
brought
to
the
attention
of
congress
as
is
pointed
out
in
the
memorandums,
which
ultimately
culminated
in
the
1892
statute,
which
is
found
at
27
statutes
at
large
page
62
and
following.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
1892
statute
confers
jurisdiction
upon
the
state
and
that
it
expressly
purports
to
do
so.
in
this
connection,
i
would
further
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
legislative
history
surrounding
the
enactment
of
the
1892
statue,
clearly
demonstrates
that
congress
had
before
it
the
precise
question
of
whether
or
not
to
ratify
the
1891
agreement.
in
fact,
the
house
of
representatives
did
so.
the
senate
did
not
concur
and
the
matter
finally
culminated
in
the
exact
language
of
the
1892
statue,
which
because
the
critical
nature
of
the
state's
position
on
the
reliance
upon
the
statute,
i
would
like
to
just
very
briefly
read
the
precise
language
employed
by
congress,
remembering
that
the
proposed
inclusion
of
a
reservation
of
fishing
and
hunting
rights,
the
house
version
was
rejected
by
the
senate
in
favor
of
this
language
which
finally
did
pass
congress.
the
statute
provides
that
the
northern
half
be
and
is
hereby,
vacated
and
restored
to
the
public
domain,
notwithstanding
any
executive
order
or
other
proceeding
whereby
the
same
was
set
apart
as
a
reservation
for
any
indians
or
bands
of
indians
and
the
same
shall
be
open
to
settlement
and
entry
by
proclamation
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
shall
be
disposed
of
under
the
general
laws
applicable
to
the
disposition
of
public
lands
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
i
am
reading
from
page
12
of
the
brief
of
appellee,
the
blue
brief.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
that
is
my
understanding
of
--
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
a
caveat
on
purported
to
ratify,
which
leads
to
the
next
leg
of
my
argument.
it
is
--
even
if
we
assume
that
the
1871
statute
is
to
be
given
no
effect,
which
of
course
we
do
not
agree
with
that
--
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
--
prohibiting,
saying
further,
saying
no
more
treaties
and
if
we
assume
for
purposes
of
argument
that
the
commissioners
who
executed
the
treaties
purported
to
execute
a
treaty,
the
question
is,
whether
or
not,
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
article
2,
section
2,
clause
2
which
requires
rectification
by
two-thirds
of
the
senators
present,
whether
or
not
in
fact
there
was
a
ratification
legally
and
constitutionally
of
the
1891
agreement
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
it
could
be
a
reason
--
i
think
we
must
be
careful
to
distinguish
between
the
question
of
dealing
with
the
police
powers
of
the
state,
the
state
of
washington
being
admitted
into
the
union
in
1889,
and
presumably
coming
in
to
the
union
on
any
equal
footing
with
the
sister
states
and
to
distinguish
between
the
rights
of
government
or
reserved
police
power,
if
you
will,
the
right
to
regulate
the
hunting
activities
over
the
land
in
question
and
the
right
in
this
nature
of
an
easement,
the
right
to
go
upon
others
land
and
hunt,
does
not
deal
with
the
subject
matter
of
the
right
of
the
state
to
govern
or
the
right
of
the
state
to
apply
the
laws
in
question
to
the
indians
in
the
extinguished
northern
half.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
my
position.
i
would
further,
in
support,
i
am
on
this
subject
generally
of
ratification
mr.
justice
stewart,
i'd
like
to
further
respond
to
your
queries
by
pointing
out
that
the
precise
language
employed
by
congress
in
the
1906
appropriation
act
itself
states
that
it's
purpose
was
to
authorize
payment
to
the
indians
in
order
to
carry
into
effect
the
agreement
of
1891.
and
the
exact
language
employed
by
congress
i
would
submit,
would
support
the
conclusion
that
it
was
congressional,
that
it
demonstrates
congressional
intentions
simply
to
pay
for
the
lands
acquired
i'd
further
submit
that
the
language
cited
by
the
federal
governing
in
their
amicus
brief,
the
comments
of
justice
fullerton,
former
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington,
who
was
one
of
the
commissioners
who
dealt
with
the
colville
indians,
dealt
solely
with
the
question
of
obtaining
compensation
from
congress
for
the
payment,
for
the
taking,
if
you
will,
or
the
opening
of
these
northern
half
lands.
it
is
our
position
that
the
any
--
the
the
subsequent
1906
and
following
appropriation
acts
which
are
set
forth
in
our
memorandum,
our
brief,
do
not
purport
to
ratify
in
the
constitutional
sense
of
ratification,
in
the
1891
agreement.
that
it
is
our
position
that
similar
to
the
position
interestingly
taken
by
the
department
of
interior,
when
these
matters
were
called
to
congress'
attention
in
1906
that
the
indian
simply
had
a
--
that
indian's
did
have
a
possessory
right
to
the
northern
half
and
that
they
should
be
compensated
for
it.
the
reason
apparently,
that
congress
was
dragging
it's
feet
was
that
they
weren't
sure
as
to
whether
the
indians
even
had
a
possessory
interest
in
the
northern
half
of
the
reservation
due
to
the
fact
it
was
created
pursuing
to
an
executive
order
and
not
pursuing
to
treaty.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes,
the
reading
of
the
legislative
history
in
that
regard
would
seem
to
me
it
lead
to
that
conclusion.
i
would
further
point
out
that
the
1892
statute
which
ceded
jurisdiction
clearly,
in
our
view
to
the
state
of
washington,
has
never
been
modified
or
repealed.
and
in
this
connection
i
would
point
out
that
the
constitution
of
united
states,
article
1,
section
8,
clause
16,
provides
that
the
jurisdiction
of
a
state,
once
acquired
can
only
be
retroceded
with
a
consent
of
the
state
legislature.
and
there
is
not
showing
in
this
record
and
in
fact
the
legislature
has
not
in
--
purported
to
retrocede
to
the
federal
government
jurisdiction
over
the
northern
half.
in
fact,
what
appellants
seem
to
be
arguing
is
that
the
state
should
be
deprived
of
the
jurisdiction
which
it
acquired
in
1892,
by
implication
from
an
agreement
executed
for
the
purchase
of
the
lands
with
the
indian
tribes
in
1891.
we
would
submit
that
a
state
should
not
be
deprived
of
it's
jurisdiction
to
it's
to
enforce
it's
laws
upon
all
citizens
equally,
upon
the
lands
in
question
i.e.
the
former
northern
half,
upon
such
a
showing.
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
appear
to
be
quite
uniform
in
articulating
this
rationale.
i
would
further
point
out
that
the
suggestion
which
is
made
in
both
the
federal
government
amicus
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
appellants,
that
public
law
280,
somehow
comes
into
play,
in
this
case
is
spurious.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
public
law
280,
which
is
the
state's
assumption
of
jurisdiction
over
indian
reservations,
it
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1953,
became
effective
in
august,
1953.
our
position
simply
is
that
public
law
280
does
not
apply
because,
“the
northern
half
was
not
an
indian
reservation”
as
of
the
date
of
it's
enactment.
therefore
by
it's
terms,
it
does
not
apply
to
the
northern,
the
extinguished
northern
half
of
the
colville
indian
reservation.
and
therefore
the
menominee
decision
of
this
court,
the
companion
case
to
puyallup
i
simply
does
not
apply.
menominee
of
course
dealt
with
the
express
termination
of
a
treaty
tribe
and
of
course
the
situation
is
dramatically
different
here.
where
in
other
words,
the
indian
country
concept
in
this
opinion
written
by
justice
douglas,
the
indian
country
concept
was
clearly
set
forth
that
the
lands
must
occupy
their
unique
status
as
indian
county
and
indian
reservation
in
order
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
public
law
280
in
order
for
it's
terms
to
be
applicable
and
the
court
in
the
unanimous
opinion
was
very
careful
to
make
that
distinction.
i'd
like
to
further
point
out
that
in
subsequent
congressional
treatment
of
the
northern
half,
the
extinguished
northern
half
of
the
colville
indian
reservation
has
uniformly
dealt
with
it,
as
if
it
were
extinguished,
the
precise
congressional
statutes
are
set
forth
in
our
memorandum.
this
subsequent
congressional
treatment
is
reflected
in
several
opinions
of
this
court.
i'd
specifically
refer
to
court
to
united
states
versus
pelican
which
is
found
in
232
u.s
and
i
am
reading
at
page
446,
a
very
short
sentence
which
i
believe
is
on
this
point.
in
dealing
with
the
question
of
the
northern
half,
the
evident
purpose
of
congress
was
to
carve
out,
of
the
portion
of
the
reservation
restored
to
the
public
domain,
the
lands
to
be
alloted
and
reserved
as
stated
and
to
make
the
restoration
effective
only
as
to
the,
the
vacation
and
restoration
which
the
statute
accomplished
section
1,
was
thus
so
forth
made
subject
to
the
reservation
and
allotments
of
land
in
severalty.
now,
as
i
have
mentioned
the
stipulated
facts,
facts
that
were
stipulated
by
mr.
morisset
and
i
at
the
original
trial
of
this
matter
in
republic
washington
indicate
that
the
offense
occurred
on
non
allotted,
non-indian
lands.
so,
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
an
allotment
remaining
in
the
northern
half
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
with
regard
to
the
jurisdictional
argument
was
article
1,
section
8,
clause
16,
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
construing
this
constitutional
provision,
make
it
clear
that
once
a
jurisdiction
of
a
state
vests
or
is
acquired,
that
it
can
may
only
be
retroceded
to
the
united
states
with
the
express
concern
of
the
state
legislature.
the
case
is
referred
to
are
james
versus
travis
construction
company,
fort
leavenworth
railway
versus
lowe,
both
which
are
cited
in
the
brief
of
appellants.
there
are
two
other
decisions
of
this
court
subsequent
to
pelican
decision
which
expressly
recognized
the
diminishment,
if
you
will,
and
the
extinguishment
of
the
northern
half
and
the
diminishment
of
the
size
of
the
colville
indian
reservation
to
it's
present
size
which
is
approximately
one-half
of
it's
original
size.
as
the
court
is
aware
the
original
boundaries
extended
to
the
49th
parallel,
bounded
with
the
nation
of
canada.
this
is
by
the
way
reflected
by
state's
exhibit
number
one,
a
copy
of
which
is
in
the
record
and
was
provided
and
is
available
for
the
court's
inspection.
state's
exhibit
number
one
likewise
by
a
red
x
locates
the
precise
location
of
the
offense
as
being
a
non-indian,
non
allotted
lands
again
and
not
within
the
boundaries
of
a
national
forest.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes,
it
is.
it
is
privately
owned,
non
allotted,
non-indian
land
and
the
map,
state's
exhibit
number
indicates
that
the
locus
delicti
is
not
within
the
boundaries
of
a
national
forest.
now,
i
have
gone
a
little
further
than
that
as
the
court
is
aware
in
terms
of
the
motion
to
strike
and
further
reply
brief
to
this
new
issue
which
was
interjected
three
or
four
weeks
ago
when
i
received
a
copy
of
the
federal
government's
brief
as
a
amicus.
this
is
might
logic,
if
i
get
respond
just
very
briefly
to
their
argument.
their
position
appears
to
be
that
to
the
extent
that
the
extinguished
northern
half
is
a
national
forest,
that
the
indians
at
least
have
this
much
room
or
this
much
at
least
free
from
any
state
jurisdiction
or
state
authority
to
apply
the
hunting
laws
in
the
question
and
i
would
submit
that
this
position
is
erroneous
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all
as
i
have
previously
indicated
the
locus
delicti
is
not
within
national
forest
boundaries.
secondly,
the
establishment
of
national
forest
occurred
after
the
acceptance
of
jurisdiction,
by
the
state.
it's
pointed
out,
that
colville
national
forest
was
established
by
presidential
proclamation
in
1907,
and
further
the
statutes
by
which
the
national
forest
of
the
united
states
are
established
are
set
forth
in
page
3
of
the
orange
reply
brief
indicate
that
the
jurisdiction,
both
civil
and
criminal
over
persons
within
such
national
forests
shall
not
be
affected
or
changed
by
reason
of
the
existence
of
such
reservations
and
so
on.
it
says
that
the
state
or
in
any
such
national
forest
situated
shall
not,
by
reason
of
the
establishment
thereof,
lose
it's
jurisdiction
nor
the
inhabitants
thereof
their
rights
and
privileges
as
citizens
of
the
state.
this
is
as
presently
quantified
in
16
usc
480
and
has
been
construed
definitively
by
this
court
in
wilson
versus
cook,
which
is
set
forth
in
the
brief.
the
federal
government
likewise
appears
to
argue
and
as
do
the
appellants
that
somehow
the
indians
were
nearby
a
national
forest
and
were
somehow
acting
pursuant
to
some
sort
of
federal
statutory
authority
enjoyed
by
representatives
of
the
department
of
interior
or
the
national
forest
service.
the
case
authority
cited
in
support
for
this
proposition
in
our
view
does
not
apply
to
the
case
at
bar.
we
do
not
have
a
situation
present
in
this
case
as
was
presented
to
this
court
in
hunt
versus
united
states,
wherein
federal
officials
were
killing
deer,
contrary
to
the
state
law
where
there
was
showing
that
the
deer
were
in
fact,
doing
damage
to
publicly
owned
lands,
in
that
case,
a
national
park.
there
is
no
showing
--
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
no
i
am
sorry,
i
have
the
wrong.
no,
it's
at
the
end
of
that
clause.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
the
clause
17,
your
honor.
i
am
sorry.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes,
that
is
the
clause.
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
know
how
my
handwritten
notes
got
the
wrong
clause.
it's
article
1,
section
8,
clause
17,
as
construed
by
the
court
in
the
cases
as
i
have
indicated.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes,
i
am
very
sorry
for
that.
thank
you
for
calling
it
to
my
attention.
so
in
sum,
the
facts
of
this
case
indicate
clearly
that
the
indians
were
not
acting
here
as
a
agents
of
the
federal
government,
nor
that
their
activities
in
killing
the
deer
out
of
season
were
necessary
for
the
protection
of
government
property
lying
either
within
or
in
this
case,
without
the
boundaries
of
a
national
forest.
i
believe
that's
a
spurious
issue
which
was
interjected
at
a
very
late
date
in
this
proceeding
by
the
amicus
brief
of
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
yes.
finally
i
just
to
summarize,
i
would
like
to
further
point
out
to
this
court,
subsequent
to
the
pelican
decision
in
seymour
versus
superintendent,
has
expressly
recognized
the
legal
effect
of
the
1892
statute,
i
referred
to
with
the
following
language,
i
am
reading
from
368
us
at
page
354.
in
1892,
the
size
of
this
reservation
was
diminished
when
congress
passed
an
act
providing
that
subject
to
reservations
and
allotments
made
to
individual
colville
indians
about
one-half
of
the
original
colville
in
reservation
since
commonly
referred
to
as
the
north
half
should
be
vacated
and
restored
to
the
public
domain.
the
court
goes
on
to
observe
that
this
act
didn't
however,
purport
to
effect
the
status
of
the
remaining
part
of
the
reservation
since
known
as
the
south
half.
finally,
in
this
same
vein,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
mattz
versus
arnett
decision
which
was
written
by
justice
blackmun
in
october
term
1972.
we
read
from
page,
very
briefly
from
page
412
us
at
page
504,
footnote
22.
here
the
court
unanimously
was
reaching
a
conclusion
with
that
the
hupa
and
yurok
indians
of
california,
that
their
reservations
in
the
court
are
along
the
river
between
the
two
have
never
been
expressly
dealt
with
or
terminated
by
congress.
and
in
reaching
this
conclusion
the
court
contrasted,
made
the
point
that
where
congress
desired
to
specifically
extinguish
or
to
terminate
an
indian
reservation
it
clearly
was
capable
of
doing
so
with
express
language.
and
in
support
of
that
proposition
the
court
states
unanimously
that
congress
has
used
clear
language
of
express
termination
when
that
result
is
desired.
see
for
example.
27
stat
63
1892;
the
1892
statute
adopted
just
two
weeks
after
the
1892
with
which
this
case
is
concerned,
providing
that
the
north
half
of
the
colville
indian
reservation
“the
same
being
a
portion
of
the
colville
indian
reservation
b,
and
is
hereby
vacated
and
restored
to
the
public
domain
and
citing
with
approval
the
seymour
versus
superintendent
decision.”
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
lawrence
coniff,
jr.
i
apologize
on
behalf
for
the
inconvenience
caused
to
court
by
that
error.
