justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
occurred
on
what
kind
of
land?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
is
it,
it's
the
land
on
which
the
incident
occurred
subject
to
state
taxation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
morisset,
during
my
brief
tenure
on
the
court
i
have
heard
the
term
alloted
lands
used
in
a
number
of
arguments
involving
indian
cases,
and
i
have
tried
to
read
and
find
out
what
they
meant,
i
really
don't
know
what
that
term
means,
can
you
define
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
record
title
then
is
in
the
united
states
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
your
questions
presented
on
page
four
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
you
certainly
didn't
raise
any
question
like
that,
did
you
and
that's
all
that's
before
the
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
not
on
tribal
land,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think,
that
non-indians
could
hunt
in
the
same
area
consistently
with
the
treaty,
couldn't
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
non-indians.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
sale.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
act
of
congress
simply
appropriated
money,
didn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
hike
variable?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
intern?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it
is
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
with
regard
to
mrs.
antoine?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
well
also
with
regard
to
the
effect
of
the
judgment
honor
and
with
respect
to
whether
she
have
to
be
re-prosecuted
as
an
aider
and
abettor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
are
also
here,
are
you
not,
to
defend
the
judgments
that
have
been
entered
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington
which
affirmed
the
judgment
of
conviction
against
her?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
you
can
leave
it
to
the
other
side
presumably
to
attack
the
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
in
the
brief
or
records
is
that
passage
that
you
are
reading
from?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
that
if
the
government
after
washington
had
attained
statehood
had
allowed
homesteading
of
certain
land
that
in
owned
and/or
would
ultimately
passage
into
private
hands
through
a
patent
that
the
federal
government
couldn't
have
accompanied
that
pattern
by
a
guaranteed
to
the
homesteader
that
they
would
never
be
the
subject
to
police
power
at
the
state
of
washington?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
most
states
that
i
am
familiar
with
mr.
morisset
allow
posting,
that
is
a
private
land
owner
can
say
even
though
you
have
got
a
hunting
license,
even
thought
it
is
hunting
season,
you
can't
hunt
on
the
land
that
i
privately
own.
now,
would
you
say
that
this
private
landowner
if
that
is
in
fact
where
this
took
place
can't
say
that
to
a
member
of
the
colville
tribe?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
answer
is
yes
or
no?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
if
it
is
a
question
of
can
he
shoot
the
deer
on
this
land,
not
can
he
pass
over
it?
