and
if
it
is
an
individual
indian
then
that
means
it's
an
alloted
land.
justice
potter
stewart
otherwise
it's
an
ordinary
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
like
another
reservation.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
a
treaty.
justice
potter
stewart
there
were
no
treaties
after
1871,
that
was
sale.
justice
potter
stewart
this
isn't
an
unlicensed
hunting,
it's
a
hunting
out
of
season?
justice
potter
stewart
the
chronology
as
i
understand
it
was
this
agreement
in
the
1891
and
then
legislation
in
1892
which
almost
rejected
the
agreement
implicitly
so,
at
least,
one
house
of
congress
thought
that
the
land
hasn't
been
the
indians
to
sell.
and
then
a
15-year
lobbying
effort
by
the
indians
culminating
in
the
legislation
of
1906,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
1891
agreement,
1892
legislation
which
was
inconsistent
with
the
agreement
and
then
1906
law
that
was
consistent
with
the
agreement
and
purported
to
be
ratified.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
1871
statute
--
?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
an
agreement
needs
to
be
a
treaty.
the
government
can
make
an
agreement
with
you,
it's
not
a
treaty,
it's
vis-a-vis
your
land?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
that
agreement
for
the
purchase
of
your
land
it
can
give
you
certain
remaining
rights
in
it,
like
the
right
to
hunt
or
fish,
even
though
it
may
well
belong
to
the
government.
it's
not
a
treaty.
it's
just
to,
that's
just
the
purchase.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
divided
the
two,
it
had
divided
the
two
house
of
congress
by
1992.
justice
potter
stewart
what
comes
into?
justice
potter
stewart
privately
owned
by
a
non-indian
presumably,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
had
that
subjected
on
the
just
in
a
little
footnote
7
of
their
brief,
it's
unencrypted
form
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
i
really
don't
understand
that
you
are
making
the
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
to
get
to
the
stream,
and
the
stream
didn't
belong
to
the
private
owner,
but
here
the
land
on
which
the
deer
was
shot
and
killed
that
did
belong
to
the
private
owner.
it
was
on
his
land
and
certainly
is
it
your
submission
that
the
state
of
washington
county
can't
even
enforce
it
so
ordinary
trespass
laws
against
indians?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
is
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
they
was
not
crossing
the
land
to
get
somewhere
else,
he
is
hunting
the
deer
on
this
land,
and
then
killing
it
on
the
land,
and
he
is
shooting
off
a
gun
on
the
land
and
therefore
presumably
or
at
least
hypothetically
he
maybe
endangering
other
people?
justice
potter
stewart
going
too
far
what
kind
of
a
term
is
that
of,
what
specifically?
justice
potter
stewart
has
there
been
a
case
before
involving
this
kind
of
language
in
anything
other
than
a
treaty
filed
up,
in
the
other
cases,
there
are
all
involved
treaties.
now
this
we
--
it's
common
ground
that
i
gathered
that
this
is,
whatever
it
is,
it's
not
a
treaty.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
has
there
been
a
case
in
this
court
before
involving
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
not
restricted
kind
of
right.
in
the
same
language
or
similar
language,
it
might
create
the
same
--
purport
to
create
the
same
right
in
a
treaty,
but
this
is
not
a
treaty.
justice
potter
stewart
and
my
question
is,
is
there
any
previous
case
in
this
court
dealt
with
any
such
language
in
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
in
a
purchase
and
sale
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
either.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
alone
wouldn't,
you
are
not
relying
on.
you
have
to
rely
on
the
language,
don't
you?
--
1899.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then,
aren't
you
relying
on
the
language
of
the
1891
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
but
wouldn't
the
–
if
there
hadn't
been
any
such
language
and
if
there
had
been
simply
the
1906
legislation,
would
you
have
the
same
case?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
and
if
there
had
been
no
such
language
in
the
agreement,
would
you
have
the
same
case
or
any
kind
of
a
case
at
all?
all
the
1906
legislation
did
was
to
–
it
was
a
five
installments
of
300,000
each.
justice
potter
stewart
--
when
they
sold
the
land,
didn't
they
sell
everything
that
went
with
it
in
the
absence
of
the
language
on
which
you
rely?
