we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
73-717,
antoine
against
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
morisset,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
focusing
on
the
land,
where
this
hunting
occurred,
others
people,
others
land
members
of
this
tribe
permitted
to
hunt
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
there
is
no
question
about
the
states
right
to
acquire
licenses
or
any
other
restrictions
with
respect
to
others
than
members
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
more
specifically,
finding
four
refers
to
defendant
alexander
antoine
in
conclusion
of
law
2
and
3
speak
of
defendant
in
the
singular.
i
should
think,
you
might
well
make
your
point
of
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
leave
the
question
of
these
alloted
lands
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
puzzled
about,
when
the
land
is
alloted,
will
you
clarify
for
me,
is
that
alloted
the
way
a
conveyance
of
the
farm
land,
piece
of
farm
land
is
alloted
by
meats
and
bounds
description
or
other
specific
description?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
morisset.
mr.
coniff.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
perhaps
because
if
she
was
referred
to
in
the
judgment
that
followed
the
findings
of
the
facts
and
conclusions
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
--
this
record
would
suggest
at
least
the
possibility
that
that's
a
jurisdictional
matter
and
that
whether
it
was
raised
or
not
the
court
could
take
notice
of
the
absence
of
jurisdiction
over
her,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
provision
of
the
federal
constitution,
you
referred
to,
which
you
said
that
limited
right
of
congress
to
impair
any
right
of
the
state
after
1889?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
aren't
numbered
so
it
makes
it
a
little
difficult
sometimes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
has
expired
now
mr.
coniff.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
morisset,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
are
saying
is
that
an
indian
of
category
of
okanogan
has
a
greater
right
to
hunt
in
this
area
than
non-indian
citizen
in
the
state
of
washington
with
a
license?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
and
that
he
derives
that
right
because
of
â€“
in
fact,
that
it
existed
before
the
government
ever
issued
a
patent
on
that
land
through
anyone.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
