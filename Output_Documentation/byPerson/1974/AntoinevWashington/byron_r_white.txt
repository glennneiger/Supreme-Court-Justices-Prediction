isn't
there
is
some
cut-off
date
in
the
statue
that
wasn't
there
or
has
it
been
indefinitely
extended?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
(inaudible)
trust
would
end
at
sometime?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
this
land
under
the
general
allotment
act
or
special?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
were
the
charges
filed
against
her?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
allege
about
her?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
really,
they
would
have
to
prosecute
her,
file
another
charge
if
they
wanted
to
prosecute
her
because
she
was
charged
as
an
aider
and
abettor?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
she
is
found
--
if
he
is
found
--
if
he
wins
here,
she
is
out
of
trouble?
