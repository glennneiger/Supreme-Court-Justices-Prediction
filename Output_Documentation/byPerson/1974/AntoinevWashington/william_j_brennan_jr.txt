gather
you

jr.
i
notice,
as
the
wife
in
discussing
with
mr.
justice
blackmun,
you
have
a
footnote
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
that
she
is
an
indian
but
not
an
enrolled
member
of
the
tribe.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
does
that
place
your
position
as
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
they
have
the
benefit
of
the
reservation,
will
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
she
were
hunting
on
her
own?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what's
the
law
it
had
been
where
the
reservation
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
the
washington
courts?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
coniff,
if
he
could
not
be
prosecuted,
could
she
not
a
member
of
the
--
not
enrolled
member
of
the
tribe?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
that
the
reversal
here,
is
a
little
one,
would
not
mean
that
she
would
be
--
the
affirmance
here
would
not
mean
necessary
that
she
couldn't
be
prosecuted?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
stated
too
in
her
jurisdictional
statement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
she
is
not
non-enrolled
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
referred
us
to
article

section

say
clause

authority
of
training
the

according
to
(inaudible)
described
by
the
congress.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
the
last

by
the
concerned
or

the
first
of
these
cases,
73-717,
antoine
v.
washington
is
here
from
the
--
in
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
in
1891,
the
confederated
colville
indian
tribes
sold
to
the
united
states
the
northern
half
of
their
reservation
in
the
state
of
washington,
the
agreement
of
sale
to
which
the
state
of
washington
was
not
a
party.
expressly
reserved
from
the
sale
and
preserved
to
the
members
of
the
tribes
and
their
descendants
the
rights
to
hunt
and
fish
that
the
indians
then
enjoyed
on
the
land
sold.
the
congress
duly
ratified
that
agreement.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
operated
to
constitute
the
ratified
reservation
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
superior
to
the
state
of
washington's
game
laws
had
make
it
an
offense
to
hunt
dear
out
of
season.
the
supreme
court
of
washington
held
that
the
supremacy
clause
did
not
have
that
effect
since
the
state
had
not
been
a
party
to
the
1891
agreement
and
accordingly
affirm
the
convictions
of
the
appellant
indians
for
hunting
deer
out
of
season.
we
reverse.
we
hold
the
congressional
ratification
of
the
1891
agreement
constituted
the
provision
reserving
hunting
and
fishing
rights
by
force
of
the
supremacy
clause,
the
supreme
law
superior
and
paramount
to
the
authority
of
washington
and
neither
the
participation
of
washington
as
a
party
to
the
agreement
or
an
expressed
provision
in
the
statute,
ratification
statute
precluding
state
authority
or
the
consent
of
the
state
was
required
to
achieve
that
result.
mr.
justice
douglas
concurs
and
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
