mr.
mason
d.
morisset
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
antoine
against
state
of
washington
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
it
involves
the
hunting
rights
of
the
confederated
tribes
of
the
colville
indian
reservation
on
the
land
which
was
sold
by
them
to
united
states
government
in
1891,
having
been
prior
to
that
time,
a
part
of
their
reservation
as
set
aside
by
the
president
in
1872.
the
facts
are
fairly
simple.
mr.
antoine
and
his
wife
irene
shot
a
deer,
in
the
fall
of
1971
on
this
land
during
a
time
in
which
hunting
was
closed
by
the
laws
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
colville
confederated
tribes
and
mr.
antoine
are
of
the
opinion
that
their
rights
to
hunt
on
that
land
were
guaranteed
by
the
1891
sale
agreement
as
ratified
by
the
congress
and
that
the
state
of
washington
has
no
right
to
stop
them
from
hunting
there
whatsoever,
or
in
the
alternative
if
some
right
is
found,
the
state
can
do
so
only
upon
a
prior
showing
of
necessity
for
conservation.
let
me
trace
the
chronology
briefly
of
what
happened
on
what
we
called
the
old
north
half
of
the
colville
reservation.
this
was
the
aboriginal
home
of
various
tribes
and
bands
which
now
make
up
the
confederated
colville
tribes.
there
was
no
treaty
signed
with
these
groups
and
bands
but
finally
in
1872,
the
president
set
aside
approximately
three
million
acres
of
land
as
a
reservation.
this
is
the
1872
executive
order.
thereafter,
the
state
of
washington,
or
what
was
then
the
territory
of
washington
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1889.
in
1891,
the
congress
formed
a
commission
to
go
and
in
the
words
of
the
act,
meet
and
treat
with
the
indians
to
buy
and
purchase
whatever
land
they
might
wish
to
sell.
an
agreement
was
reached
to
sell
the
north
half
of
the
reservation.
approximately,
one
and
half
million
acres
running
up
to
the
canadian
border
between
the
okanogan
and
columbia
rivers.
that
agreement
was
not
immediately
ratified
by
the
congress.
rather
in
1892,
the
congress
passed
an
act
which
unilaterally
took
the
land
back.
subsequently,
the
indians
agitated
and
lobbied
for
the
ratification
of
their
agreement
and
the
payment
of
the
money.
this
was
ultimately
accomplished
in
1906
by
an
appropriation
act
whereby
the
congress
to
carry
into
effect
the
agreement,
authorized
the
payment
of
money
and
thereafter,
in
subsequent
appropriation
acts,
actually
authorized
the
payment
in
$300,000
increment
to
the
money.
now
1872
then,
finds
the
vesting
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights
in
this
land
in
question
by
the
federal
government.
it
was
an
indian
reservation
with
all
the
rights
that
go
along
with
that,
the
right
to
exclude
non-indians
from
that
land,
the
right
to
fish
and
hunt
without
control
by
the
territorial
or
state
government
and
all
the
many
other
rights
which
this
court
knows
attend
a
reservation
status.
in
1891,
the
indians
agreed
to
surrender
and
relinquish
all
rights
entitled
to
the
land,
but
they
reserved
many
rights.
they
reserved,
for
example,
allotments
in
this
area
and
to
this
day,
many
members
of
the
tribes
still
live
on
their
allotments
on
this
sold
land.
they
reserve
the
right
to
the
use
of
the
water
and
water
courses
attended
to
those
allotments
and
they
reserved,
in
section
6
of
the
agreement,
that
the
right
to
fish
and
hunt
shall
not
be
taken
away
or
in
any
ways
abridged.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
the
alloted
lands
are
not,
your
honor.
they
are
trust
land
held
by
the
united
states.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct.
this
incident
however,
did
not
occur
on
trust
land,
your
honor.
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
it
did
not
occur
on
trust
land.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
as
far
as
we
know
this
is
fee
simple
land,
held
probably
by
an
individual.
none
of
the
maps
that
i
have
seen
and
it
was
not
submitted
at
trial,
indicate
who
exactly
owns
the
land.
it
is
open,
not
posted
or
fenced
as
far
as
we
know.
it
is
not
state
land
as
far
as
i
know,
it
is
not
federal
forest
land.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
it
probably
is,
if
it's
held
by
an
individual
in
fee
and
i
think
we
can
assume
that
it
is.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
partially
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
agreement
by
setting
up
the
allotments
would
be
the
document
from
which
that
non-taxability
flows.
it
was
the
agreement
that
said,
the
indians
may
reserve
some
alloted
lands
on
that
north
half.
but
it
is
the
status
of
the
land
itself,
rather
than
the
agreement
that
leads
to
the
non-taxability,
that's
true.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
non-indians
who
are
citizens
to
this
state
would
certainly
be
allowed
to
hunt
there,
yes.
it
is
not
a
close
area
per
se,
it's
not
posted
or
fenced
off,
or
posted
there
is
no
hunting.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
to
non-indians
--
that's
correct,
your
honor,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
certainly,
your
honor.
the
united
states
generally
holds
land
as
the
fee
simple
owner
for
indian
tribes.
now
that
is
the
status
of
most
reservations.
united
states
is
the
owner,
it
has
the
fee
that's
held
in
trust
for
the
indian
tribe.
now
that
land
can
be
alloted
to
an
individual,
and
the
individual
receives
a
patent
allotments
like
a
deed,
you
give
it
to
them,
the
individual
indian
has
the
rights
of
usage
of
the
land,
he
has
the
right
to
devise
it
by
will,
and
in
the
state
of
intestacy
it
would
pass
to
his
heirs
under
special
federal
statutes.
but
the
indian
does
not
have
a
right
to
mortgage
or
alienate
that
land
without
the
permission
of
the
secretary
of
interior
because
the
secretory
as
the
government's
agent
is
the
owner,
he
has
the
fee.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
united
states
government,
a
regular
title
report
which
show
fee
in
the
united
states
of
america
in
trust
for
in
either
the
tribe
as
a
whole
or
an
individual
indian,
that's
the
way
the
record
agrees.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
would
be
non
alloted
trust.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
right,
non
alloted
trust.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
there
is
a
variety
of
allotments
statute,
the
general
allotment
act
had
a
cut-off
date
which
has
been
constantly
and
consistently
continued
by
congress.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
and
right,
it
was
originally
25
years,
it
has
been
continued,
i
believe,
in
25-year
increments
possibly
more.
there
is
now
several
allotment
acts
and
i
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
this
was
under
a
special
allotment
act,
which
flowed
from
the
1892
at
the
congress,
and
the
1891
agreement.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
she
is
an
okanogan,
yes.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
not
enrolled
in
this
country,
no.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
do
not
raise
any
question
because
the
facts
which
don't
appear
on
the
record,
because
they
were
not
deemed
to
be
material
i
believe
are
that
she
could
be
no
more
than
an
aider
or
an
abettor
and
my
position
would
be
as
a
matter
of
criminal
law,
mr.
antoine
committed
no
crime,
she
couldn't
very
well
have
aided
and
abetted
him
in
such
a
known
act
and
she
was
along
for
the
ride,
in
other
words.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well
that
is
the
situation
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
don't
want
to
answer
the
question
but
i
suppose
you
could
your
honor.
my
position
is
that
she
can't
have
aided
and
abetted
her
husband,
if
he
did
nothing
wrong,
there
is
nothing
wrong
for
her
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct,
your
honor,
there
is
no
more
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
there
are
no
more
findings
on
the
record
that
have
been
other
than
printed
in
the
appendix
as
to
her,
to
mrs.
antoine.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
ah
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well
as,
i
think
in
here
is
deficiency
but
i
think
that
more
central,
more
important
point
is
that
alex
antoine
committed
no
crime
and
when
his
conviction
falls,
mrs.
antoine
will
of
necessity
falls.
she
could
not
have
done
anything
other
than
to
be
along
what
if
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
now
that's
--
that's
a
difficult
fact
question
because
it
differs
from
reservation
to
reservation.
but
in
most
cases,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
in
the
early
years,
the
war
department
carried
out
some
kind
of
survey
and
many
of
these
reservation
lands
have
government,
special
government
plats.
they
don't
exist
in
the
archive,
because
i
have
tried
to
dig
them
up
and
they
will
be
alloted
by
a
lot
number
and
they
will
have
an
allotment
number
141,
and
you
have
to
go
to
an
original
government
plat
to
find,
what
that
means
and
sometimes,
that
will
be
a
map
or
it
will
be
meats
and
bounds
and
in
some
occasion,
it
differs
greatly.
now
i
was
â€“-
i
believe
discussing
the
1891
agreement
and
noting
that
the
indians
had
to
lobby
for
sometime
before
the
agreement
was
carried
into
effect,
approximatively
15
years.
in
1906,
the
congress
did
ratify
the
agreement,
appropriate
the
money
to
carried
into
effect
and
the
money
was
gradually
paid
out
over
the
years.
now
the
affected
agreement
to
these
appellants
that
their
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
guaranteed
by
supreme
federal
law.
the
state
seems
to
argue
that
this
agreement
is
not
supreme
federal
law,
and
the
state
court
in
washington,
seemed
to
hold
that.
i
find
no
support
for
that
in
any
of
the
learning
and
teachings
of
this
court.
certainly
the
congress
has
plenary
power
over
indian
tribes
and
has
exercised
that
power
through
the
years.
certainly
at
the
time,
that
the
promise
was
made,
this
was
federal
land.
in
fact,
the
whole
area
was
a
territory,
the
whole
area
was
federal
land
and
the
particular
area
in
question,
the
north
half
of
the
reservation
was
even
more
federal
than
the
whole
territory,
if
that's
possible
because
it
was
an
indian
reservation
and
the
federal
government
had
full
authority
and
control
over
that
land
as
trustee
for
the
indians.
so
the
two
owners
of
the
land;
the
government
as
the
fee
owner,
and
the
indians
as
the
beneficial
owner,
agreed
as
to
how
it
would
be
sold
and
what
the
terms
would
be
and
the
federal
government
promised
that
hunting
and
fishing
rights
would
continue.
now
the
federal
government
has
done
this
before,
in
other
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court.
dick
versus
u.s.
for
example,
involved
the
sale
of
land
by
a
tribe
of
their
reservation
back
to
the
government
and
the
government
agreed
in
the
document,
that
federal
liquor
laws
would
continue
to
apply
not
withstanding
incorporation
of
those
areas
into
the
state
thereafter
and
this
court
held
that
of
course,
the
federal
government
could
do
that.
it
could
take
land
back
from
the
indians
and
apply
conditions
to
it.
our
position
then
is
that
the
indians
and
the
federal
government
agreed
as
to
what
the
terms
would
be
of
ceding
the
land
back
to
the
united
states
government.
and
that
the
state
of
washington
had
to
take
whatever
power
or
jurisdiction
or
authority
they
have
over
that
land,
subject
to
outstanding
federal
promises,
just
as
same
as
when
they
became
a
state
in
1889,
most
of
the
land
at
that
time
was
tied
up
in
some
sort
of
federal
ownership.
now,
getting
to
the
words
of
the
agreement
itself,
as
ratified
by
the
congress,
it's
our
position
that
the
words
shall
not
be
taken
away
or
in
anywise
be
abridged
mean
that
the
state
has
no
authority
whatsoever
to
regulate
indian
hunting
and
fishing
on
that
north
half.
they
took
or
became
a
state,
subject
to
the
outstanding
promise
of
the
federal
government,
and
it
is
for
the
federal
government
and
the
indians
to
decide
how
hunting
and
fishing
rights
will
be
exercised.
we
believe
that
this
case
is
unlike
the
puyallup
litigation
that
this
court
has
had
to
struggle
with,
as
had
the
state
courts
in
washington
for
many
years
now.
unlike
it
because
the
words
of
the
agreement
read
as
an
absolute
promise,
they
are
much
stronger
in
the
steven's
treaties.
this
court
has
had
to
struggle
with
the
steven's
treaties
which
promised
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
in
common
with
other
citizens
of
the
territory,
and
that's
all
the
treaty
say.
in
this
situation,
the
federal
agreement,
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
says
the
right
to
hunt
and
fish
in
common
with
other
citizens
of
the
united
states,
shall
not
be
taken
away
or
in
anywise
abridged.
we
feel
it
is
an
abridgment,
an
impairment
and
aggregation
of
those
rights
if
the
state
is
allowed
any
jurisdiction
or
authority
whatsoever
to
regulate
indian
hunting
and
fishing.
we
believe
that
a
holding
would
be
consistent
through
this
court's
teaching
as
to
the
need
for
indian
tribes
to
govern
themselves.
this
court
has
held
that
hunting
and
fishing
rights
are
a
tribal
right
to
be
exercised
by
the
individual
indians
and
we
believe
that
the
colville
confederated
tribes
can
and
will
regulate
this
tribal
right.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
our
position
on
that
would
be
the
same
as
it
is
been
in
fishing
litigation
in
the
state
of
washington.
the
spouse
as
immediate
families
should
be
allowed
to
participate
at
least
as
helpers
in
the
right.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
yeah
the
reservation
of
hunting
rights.
it
really
makes
no
practical
sense
to
say
that
an
indian
has
a
hunting
right
which
you
can
go
and
slap
his
wife
in
jail
and
she
accompanies
him
or
if
he
catches
the
fish
and
takes
it
home
to
feed
his
wife
and
children
who
may
not
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
still
think
that
the
spouse
should
be
allowed
to
exercise
the
right.
it
is
not
practical
in
the
sense
of
indian
life
to
not
allow
the
immediate
family,
the
spouse
and
children
to
participate
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
there
is
been
no
holding
by
this
court.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
the
only
holding
that
i
know
of
is
the
holding
of
judge
bolt
in
us
v.
washington
in
which
he
held
that,
i
don't
know
if
he
held
in
the
original
decision
or
subsequently
that
the
spouses
should
be
allowed
to
participate
in
the
treaty
right
in
that
case.
our
position
here
is
basically
the
same.
the
spouse
should
definitely
be
allowed
to
participate,
that's
a
purely
policy
argument.
it
makes
sense
in
terms
of
what
--
how
indian
tribes
operate,
how
indian
families
operate,
how
they
go
together
to
get
their
food
and
so
on.
no
particular
strict
reason
in
the
law
why
that
should
be,
but
there
is
a
reason
in
equity.
now
why
don't
we
want
any
state
power
here?
we
feel
that
state
regulation
of
indian
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
is
and
always
has
been
a
complicated
procedure
of
allocating
the
resource
to
user
groups.
complicated
procedure
involving
political
pressure,
complicated
procedure
involving
many
competing
groups
in
which
the
indian
interest
get
kind
of
left
to
the
floor,
left
to
the
bottom
of
the
heap.
we
further
feel
that
is
an
impairment
of
tribal
government.
this
is
a
tribal
right
guaranteed
by
federal
law,
but
the
tribe
has
nothing
to
say
about
it.
it
can't
take
care
of
the
resource,
it
can't
allocate
the
resource
to
its
members.
it
can't
have
any
kind
of
lottery
system
or
permit
system
to
allow
the
deer
in
this
case
to
go
to
the
most
useful
place.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no,
but
it's
a
tribal
right,
it's
a
tribal
right
as
is
all
of
reservation,
usual
and
accustomed
hunting
or
fishing
rights.
so,
tribal
resource,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor,
just
as
important
as
the
land
that's
on
the
reservation.
this
is
a
resource.
it
is
a
right,
property
right
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
of
the
tribe,
something
they
should
be
allowed
to
control
for
their
members
and
judge
bolt
in
washington
has
so
held,
that
the
indian
tribes
can
regulate
that
right
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
just
recently
held
about
two
weeks
ago,
that
the
indian
tribe
should
have
the
right
to
regulate
hunting
and
fishing
not
on
the
reservation,
but
in
areas
that
are
unusual
and
custom
places
and
we
agree
with
those
decisions,
i
think
they
make
good
sense.
they
allow
the
tribes
to
take
care
of
their
own,
to
care
of
what
rights
are
their's
under
federal
law.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
subject
to
state
law,
yes.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no,
no.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
act
of
congress.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
yeah
and
ratified
the
agreement
of
1891.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
yes.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
yes,
well
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
thought,
i
said,
my
only
remarks
that
it
was
ratified
in
1906
by
any
appropriation
act,
i
believe
i
made
that
statement.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
however,
that
these
rights,
these
hunting
and
fishing
rights
attached,
when
the
reservation
was
established,
and
it
has
been
the
teaching
of
this
court
that
such
rights
do
not
fly
away
or
disappear
by
implication,
by
some
strange
metaphysical
happening
in
an
act
of
congress
and
the
only
act
of
congress
or
only
action
of
congress
which
refers
to
the
rights
at
all
is
the
1891
agreement
and
that
could
be
--
and
of
course,
preserves
the
rights,
it
does
not
take
them
away.
the
1892
act
makes
no
mention
of
the
rights
whatsoever
and
i
believe
it's
the
teaching
in
this
court
in
menomonie,
for
example,
that
if
no
mention
are
made
of
hunting
and
fishing
rights,
which
are
vested
in
a
tribe
and
then
they
are
not
impaired
or
abrogated
or
taken
away
and
that's
a
good
teaching
and
i
would
hope
that
we
could
stand
by
that.
so,
our
position
to
summarize
is
that
the
promise
absolute
in
its
terms,
does
not
gives
the
state
any
power
or
control
whatsoever.
in
the
alternative,
arguendo,
if
there
is
any
state
power
following
a
puyallup
kind
of
reasoning,
that
the
state
has
some
authority
to
regulate
as
necessary
for
conservation,
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
we
don't
accept
that
in
this
case,
nevertheless,
they
have
made
no
case
for
conservation.
they
have
done
none
of
the
steps
that
the
trial
courts
which
have
had
to
try
to
implement
your
decisions
in
puyallup
to
come
up
with,
such
as
looking
into
the
regulation
ahead
of
time,
considering
the
indian
needs
as
a
special
need
and
making
special
provision
for
them.
the
state
has
done
nothing
of
that
kind
in
this
case
and
i
think,
it
would
be
clear
that,
this
particular
regulation
which
alexander
antoine
is
considered
to
have
violated
was
not
done
as
necessary
for
conservation
as
that
term
has
come
to
me
in
terms
of
indian
rights,
but
was
done
as
a
total
state
political
allocation
regulation.
i
wish
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
mr.
chief
justice
for
rebuttal.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
just
briefly
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
we
are
not
sure
if
it's
privately
owned,
but
it
certainly
is
not
state
land,
nor
a
federal
land
nor
an
indian
allotment
of
any
kind,
which
probably
leaves
on
privately
owned
land.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
think
that's
dicta
in
the
states
court's
opinion
and
i
disagree
completely.
this
court
held
in
winans
that
when
a
federal
law
of
some
kind
guaranteed
hunting
and
fishing
rights
to
indian,
they
at
least
in
that
case
had
a
right
of
entry
across
a
patented
piece
of
property,
a
fee
piece
of
property0
to
get
their
usual
and
custom
place.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well,
that's
a
different
case
of
course,
but
i
think
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well,
it
could
this
case,
that
will
be
the
next
case
i
am
sure.
and
my
answer
would
be
that
it
could
not
if
the
facts
were
somewhat
similar
to
winans,
that
is
an
indian
was
not
disturbing
the
peace,
was
not
endangering
a
farmer's
crop
or
his
wife
and
children
or
his
cows,
were
simply
were
trying
to
get
across
the
land,
or
was
in
an
open
field
or
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
possible.
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
one,
i
don't
think
that
the
confederated
tribes
will
exercise
this
right
in
that
way.
i
think
that's
--
we
have
to
of
course
be
concerned
with
the
out
of
reaches
of
any
behavior,
but
i
don't
it's
a
practical
matter
the
indians
are
going
to
exercise
their
right
to
endanger
others.
secondly,
if
it
should
come
to
that,
i
think
there
is
a
point
at
which
the
indian
is
not
engaged
in
hunting,
as
it
was
contemplated
by
the
agreement
and
it
is
contemplated
today,
by
hunting
statues.
a
person
or
a
white
man
can
be
hunting,
have
a
license,
be
within
state
law,
but
if
he
goes
too
far
and
runs
into
some
other
police
power
law,
he
can
still
be
found
guilty
of
that
and
i
think
the
same
principle
would
apply
here.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no
of
departing
from
hunting,
and
engaging
in
some
activity
which
endangers
public
peace.
let
me
give
a
simple
example.
i
think
that
an
indian
would
be
bound
not
to
shoot
across
a
public
highway
in
the
exercise
of
his
hunting
rights
because
the
state
there
is
not
trying
to
stop
him
from
hunting
per
se,
is
not
allocating
the
resources
as
it
is
trying
to
do
here,
is
trying
to
preserve
the
public
peace
and
if
he
insists
on
shooting
across
a
public
highway
that
really
isn't
hunting
as
it
was
guaranteed
by
this
agreement.
it
is
something
else
and
i
don't
think
that
any
responsible
indian
tribe
would
try
to
defend
that
kind
of
behavior.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
think
if
the
facts
are
similar
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
can't
answer
yes
or
no
because
it's
a
difficult
fact
law
question
as
it
was
in
winans.
if
that
barred
every
member
of
the
tribe
from
getting
to
aboriginal
in
usual
and
custom
hunting
place,
if
there
were
no
way
to
get
up
the
valley
other
than
to
cross
that
farmer's
land,
i
would
say
that
the
farmer
does
not
have
that
right.
he
took
the
fee
patent
subject
to
the
rights
of
the
indians
to
cross
his
land.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
alright,
i
understand
that.
he
will
have
a
right
to
pass
over
certainly
and
i
think
he
would
have
a
right
to
shoot
the
deer
if
he
did
not
endanger
to
that
persons
property
or
life.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
yes,
yes.
there
is
nothing
in
the
agreement
or
in
the
federal
law
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
--
that
says
that
the
patents
will
be
issued
not
subject
to
this
agreement.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
pardon
me.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
nothing
in
the
agreement
says
that
this
will
apply
only
to
unclaimed
or
unposted
lands.
it
says
all
usual
and
the
custom
places.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
pardon
me.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
it
was
not
on
forest
land,
mr.
justice
douglas,
as
far
as
we
know,
no,
it
does
not
appear
that
way
in
the
maps.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
no,
there
is
nothing.
my
own
personal
knowledge
is
that
it
varies
greatly
from
year
to
year,
some
years
it's
down,
some
years
it's
up.
and
the
indians
themselves
are
concerned
of
course
about
the
resource.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
to
my
knowledge,
there
is
no
case
involving
an
act
of
congress
as
to
this
particular
point,
this
particular
kind
of
right.
i
may
be
incorrect
in
that,
i'm
not
really
sure.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
act
of
congress
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
not
that
i
am
aware,
well,
though
there
have
been
other
purchases
in
the
sale
subsequent
to
1871,
and
those
purchases
and
sales
have
reserved
rights
and
there
may
be,
may
be
similar
cases,
but
i
don't
know.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
don't
know.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
see
my
time
--
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
absolutely.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that's
correct,
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
i
am
relying
on;
one
the
reservation
of
the
right
in
1872
and
the
fact
that
it's
never
been
taken
away,
has
never
been
mentioned
except
in
the
1891
agreement
and
there
it
is
reserved,
not
taken
away
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
yes,
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
the
right
does
not
fall
completely
if
we
completely
take
away
the
1891
agreement
because
it
preexisted
that
agreement;
it
was
simply
reserved
by
that
agreement.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
the
1906
legislation
refers
only
to
the
1891
agreement
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
that
was
1906,
authorized
the
appropriation,
the
1907
acts
authorized
300,000
a
piece.
if
there
is
--
assume
there
is
no
1891
agreement
at
all,
we
still
have
a
problem
that
the
rights
were
vested
in
the
tribe
by
the
establishment
of
the
reservation
and
we
find
nowhere
that
those
rights
have
been
taken
away.
so
in
my
position
would
be
they
exist.
mr.
mason
d.
morisset
well,
that
goes
more
to
the
disestablishment
question
and
this
court
has
held
that
in
many
cases,
where
tribes
have
been
terminated,
reservations
have
been
terminated,
that
the
hunting
and
fishing
right
continues
unless
the
congress
explicitly
says
we
take
that
away
and
i
of
course,
agree
with
those
rulings
of
the
court.
i
think
they
are
valid.
