not
simultaneous?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
district
court
required
the
general
counsel
to
prepare
material
that
wasn't
in
existence
in
order
to
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
they
say
including
existing
documents,
the
inference
is
perhaps
that
more
than
existing
document.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
united
states
attorney
say
in
the
district
court
of
missouri,
writes
back
to
the
criminal
division
of
justice
department
and
gives
them
a
set
of
facts
and
wants
to
know
whether
you
go
ahead
and
maintain
a
prosecution?
and
the
criminal
division
replies,
well,
the
eighth
circuit
the
way
its
constituted
now
isn't
up
to
go
for
this
kind
of
a
case,
we
think
maybe
the
seventh
circuit
might
be
better
so
the
way
the
law
stands
in
those
two
circuits
wait
for
one
to
come
up
in
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
their
discussion
strictly
of
legal
points.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
there
are
adjudications
under
the
aba
you
don't
need
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
require
that
are
made
public.
the
aba
requires
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
of
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you're
reading
2
(a)
as
if
there
was
a
final
opinion
within
the
meaning
of
2
(a)
in
every
single
instance
of
adjudication
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
i
certainly
don't
read
2
(a)
that
way.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
this
--
does
this
sound
to
you
as
if
it
were
addressed
to
this
type
of
prosecutorial
decision
final
opinions
including
concurring
and
dissenting
opinions?
you
don't
get
that
get
kind
of
a
thing
out
of
a
prosecutor's
office.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
smetana,
this
memorandum
you're
talking
about
on
pages
83,
84,
85
of
the
appendix.
a
good
part
of
it
just
the
general
counsel's
interpretation
of
the
board's
decisions.
i
mean,
presumably,
a
series
has
its
own
legal
department
they
can
interpret
the
board's
decision,
can't
they.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
take
a
look
at
the
thing
on
page
83
through
85.
i
see
one,
two,
three,
four
citations
to
the
board
opinions
in
that
memorandum.
