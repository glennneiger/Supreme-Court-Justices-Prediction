mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
here
on
the
writ
certiorari
to
the
court
of
the
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
whether
the
freedom
of
information
act
requires
the
disclosure
of
certain
documents
generated
by
the
general
counsel
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
so-called
advice
and
appeals
memoranda
which
relate
to
the
prosecution
of
unfair
labor
practices
before
the
board
by
the
general
counsel.
and
order
to
put
the
issue
in
context,
i
would
like
at
the
outset
to
describe
briefly
the
procedures
that
are
followed
within
the
general
counsel's
office
in
the
deciding
whether
or
not
to
prosecute
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
before
the
board.
as
this
court
is
aware,
the
national
labor
relations
board
itself
has
no
authority
to
bring
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
it
can
only
act
in
response
to
a
charge
that
has
been
filed
with
it.
if
a
charge
is
filed
and
any
person
can
file
a
charge,
then
the
general
counsel
if
he
wishes
to
may
prosecute
the
charge
but
only
in
response
to
someone
else
bringing
a
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
board
formally,
may
the
board
issue
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint.
now,
the
general
counsel
of
the
board,
who
is
a
presidential
appointee,
serves
two
functions
in
connection
with
the
having
of
cases
before
the
board.
first,
he
is
the
one
when
a
complaint
has
been
issued
who
prosecutes
the
case
before
the
board,
but
secondly
he
has
final
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
complaint
should
be
issued.
that
is,
if
after
examining
the
case,
the
general
counsel
decides
not
to
issue
a
complaint
that
is
the
end
of
that
case
as
far
as
the
board
is
concerned.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
wholly
unreviewable
held
by
a
number
of
courts
to
that
effect.
now,
the
general
counsel
in
turn
has
delegated
to
the
board's
regional
directors
of
whom
there
are
some
30th,
the
authority
initially
took
process
unfair
labor
process
charges.
when
a
charge
is
filed
with
one
of
the
regional
directors
he
investigates
that
he
ordinarily
will
interrogate
witnesses,
look
at
documents
and
so
on.
and
after
he
has
completed
his
investigation,
there
are
three
possible
things
he
may
do.
first,
he
may
conclude
that
there
is
nothing
here
that
warrants
the
issuance
of
a
complaint
and
he
decides
not
to
issue
a
complaint.
secondly,
he
may
conclude
on
the
basis
of
his
investigation
that
there's
enough
here
to
warrant
the
issuance
of
a
complaint
and
he
issues
the
complaint.
or
third,
he
may
submit
the
merit
to
the
general
counsel's
office
in
washington
for
advice
on
whether
or
not
he
should
issue
a
complaint.
the
general
counsel
has
put
out
instructions
to
the
regional
directors
that
they
are
to
refer
two
categories
of
cases
to
washington
for
advice.
one,
case
that
present
novel
or
complex
problems
or
two,
cases
that
involve
certain
issues
which
the
general
counsel
has
specified
should
be
submitted
to
him
in
washington
in
order
to
assure
a
uniform
prosecutorial
policy
with
respect
to
these
cases.
now,
when
the
general
counsel
receives
from
the
regional
director
a
request
for
advice,
the
matter
submitted
to
something
called
the
office
of
appeals
in
the
general
counsel's
office
where
the
case
is
thoroughly
and
carefully
reviewed
by
a
number
of
people.
and
this
review
process
culminates
in
something
called
an
“advice
memorandum”,
in
which
the
general
counsel
sometimes
act
himself
more
frequently
acting
through
the
man
in
charge
of
the
office
of
advice,
advices
the
regional
director
on
whether
or
not
he
should
issue
a
complaint.
this
advice
memoranda,
the
general
counsel
gives
the
reasons
for
his
decision,
discusses
the
evidence
of
the
case,
analyzes
board
precedents
and
if
the
advice
is
that
a
complaint
should
issue
generally
gives
the
theory
upon
which
he
believes
the
case
should
proceed.
now,
although
the
representative
examples
that
are
included
in
the
record
of
advice
memoranda
contain
nothing
making
any
reference
to
the
possibility
of
settlements.
the
report
--
the
two
reports
in
this
record
presented
by
the
practice
and
procedure
committee
of
the
labor
law
section
of
the
american
bar
association
on
which
sears
relies
very
heavily.
and
in
one
of
those
reports,
set
forth
at
page
71
of
the
appendix,
the
committee
which
represents
of
course
the
experts
in
this
field
both
on
the
labor
and
the
management
side,
recognizes
that
not
infrequently,
this
advice
memoranda
will
refer
to
settlement
possibilities.
it's
in
the
middle
of
page
71
and
the
statement
is,
“the
response
to
the
region
will
sometimes
include
specifics
with
respect
to
the
kind
of
settlement
or
other
action
and
will
set
forth
the
theories
upon
which
such
cause
of
action
is
based.”
and
i
stressed
that
because
the
ultimate
question
in
the
case
is
what
these
things
are.
are
they
just
a
statement
of
legal
position
or
do
they
involve
something
more.
they
basically
reflect
to
the
strategy,
the
litigation
strategy
of
the
general
counsel
has
recommended
be
followed.
and
we
think
the
fact
that
they
refer
to
settlement
negotiations
and
suggest
a
basis
upon
settlement,
to
us
is
very
clear
evidence
of
that.
now,
if
the
regional
director
should
decide
not
to
issue
a
complaint
either
because
of
the
advice
he
has
received
from
the
general
counsel
or
because
his
own
investigation
indicates
that
a
complaint
is
not
appropriate,
then
the
charging
party
has
the
right
to
appeal
that
determination
to
the
general
counsel.
the
matter
is
then
similarly
reviewed
except
by
different
office
by
something
called
the
office
of
appeals.
if
the
office
of
appeals
upholds
the
regional
director's
determination,
it
so
advises
him
and
the
parties
that
there
are
rather
brief
statement
giving
the
reasons
for
his
decision.
if
however,
the
regional
counsel
is
reversed
and
the
general
counsel
concludes
that
a
complaint
should
issue,
they
then
prepare
something
called
an
appeals
memoranda.
and
the
appeals
memoranda
is
similar
to
the
advice
memoranda
and
that
it
too
describes
the
case
suggest
theories,
gives
the
reasoning
of
the
general
counsel.
now,
it's
these
two
categories
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
the
regional
director.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
to
nobody
else,
that's
what
they
--
these
are
the
two
things
they
want
to
see.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
--
now
this
is
an
internal
document
in
which
the
general
counsel
explains
to
the
regional
director
why
he
thinks
the
case
should
go
forward.
suggest
the
legal
theories
of
the
case,
discusses
the
evidence,
may
again
refer
to
settlement
negotiations
and
will
discuss
the
applicable
board
and
court
precedents.
and
i'd
like
to
just
make
one
other
point
of
here,
because
the
claim
is
that
somehow,
these
appeals
memoranda
represent
the
law
of
the
general
counsel.
they
are
not
the
law
of
the
general
counsel,
the
general
counsel
makes
no
law,
all
he
does
is
applies
the
law
as
the
board
and
courts
have
developed
it.
he
is
the
prosecuting
arm,
the
prosecuting
arm
of
the
board
in
handling
of
this
unfair
labor
practice
during
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
the
mechanics
of
that
appeal
are
that
the
charging
party
who
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
advises
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
advises
the
charging
party.
there
are
some
examples
of
that
giving
the
reasons
why
he
has
decided
not
to
issue
a
complaint.
advising
the
charging
party,
i
believe,
that's
within
10
days
that
he
may
appeal
to
the
general
counsel.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
a
written
piece
of
paper
that
is
sent
to
the
general
counsel
indicating
why
the
charging
party
believes
that
a
complaint
should
issue
in
this
case.
if
the
charging
party
wishes
to
he
may
have
the
opportunity
to
argue
orally
before
the
general
counsel's
office
in
washington.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
potential
--
no.
the
potential
chargee
is
not
a
party,
although,
the
potential
chargee
may
have
the
opportunity
if
he
wishes
to
be
heard
also.
this
is
a
relatively
infrequent
thing.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
there's
no
--
there's
nothing
comparable
to
the
argument
before
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it's
heard
ex
parte
by
each
side.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
he
is
given
notice
of
the
appeal
by
the
--
when,
i
believe
when
the
general
--
when
the
charging
party
files
a
notice
of
appeal.
this
notice
is
given
to
the
chargee
because
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
the
appeal.
but
no,
when
it
charges
filed
initially
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
the
regional
director,
he
informs
the
party
charged?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
regional
director.
well,
let
me.
under
the
board's
regulations,
the
charging
party
has
a
response
ability
to
serve
a
copy
of
the
charge
upon
the
person
charged.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
so
he
is
put
on
notice
and
normally
in
this
situation,
not
normally
but
frequently,
the
board
or
the
regional
director's
representatives
may
interrogate
the
and
go
on
and
talk
to
the
charged
party
to
see
what
his
side
of
the
case
is.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
because
you
get
one
side
from
the
charging
party,
the
charged
party
may
have
a
wholly
different
point
of
view.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sometimes
on
an
oral
hearing
with
extensive
review
of
the
case
in
the
office
of
appeals
because
that
is
assigned
to
a
lawyer
who
studies
it
than
a
group
of
people
study
the
case.
it's
very
extensively
considered.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
it
might
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
a
week
or
two
weeks.
very
--
i
suppose
depending
on
whether
it's
going
to
be
a
hearing.
what
may
sometimes
happen
occasionally
when
the
case
gets
to
the
general
counsel's
office,
it
may
be
sent
directly
the
general
counsel
himself
may
consider.
and
let
me
say
that
this
is
exactly,
if
i
may
come
to
this
right
now.
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
what
happened
in
this
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
alright,
let
me
try
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
issue
a
choice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
then
a
notice
to
that
effect
is
sent
to
the
charging
party
and
to
the
regional
director
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there's
no
--
there's
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
are
none
other
than
the
letter
which
is
a
public
document
because
sent
to
the
parties.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
there's
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
when
in
effect
the
general
counsel
has
made
the
decision
to
authorize
the
prosecution
of
the
case,
now
the
mink
case,
that's
--
what
is
involved
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
general
counsel
has
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
authority
and
he
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
delegated
to
the
regional
director.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
right
and
he
is
delegated
to
the
regional
director
the
initial
processes
in
this
complaint.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
four
years
mr.
chief
justice.
so,
quite
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
so,
yes.
let
me
just
come
back
if
i
may
if
one
more
thing
to
talk
--
describe
a
little
bit
about
these
appeals
memoranda
and
the
advice
memoranda
here.
all
that
they
really
decide,
all
that
the
general
counsel
is
deciding
when
he
either
recommends
in
the
advice
memorandum
when
he
authorizes
a
complaint
or
in
the
--
at
the
appeals
stage
and
the
appeals
memorandum
when
he
tells
them
to
go
ahead
and
file
it,
is
that
this
is
a
matter
that
ones
presentation
to
the
board.
he
is
not
deciding
that
there
is
a
violation
and
that
is
shown
rather
explicitly.
in
this
record,
there
are
at
least
three
examples
in
the
advice
and
appeals
memoranda
and
also
in
two
letters
sent
to
counsel
for
charging
parties
in
which
it
explicitly
stated
that,
this
is
a
matter
that
warrants
passing
on
by
the
board.
let
me
just
refer
the
court
to
two
of
these
and
then
i'll
cite
the
others
at
page
191
as
advice
--
an
advice
memorandum
which
ends
up
that
authorization
of
complaint
was
warranted
to
place
the
issues
of
the
case
before
the
board.
and
then
at
page
206,
which
is
an
appeal
memorandum
in
the
second
full
paragraph
under
reasons
for
actions
it
said.
“issues
were
raised
with
respect
to
various
issues
which
warranted
board
determination
on
the
basis
of
record
testimony.”
another
example
of
that
is
at
page
211
of
the
record
and
then
at
page
32
and
199
of
the
record,
letters
sent
by
the
general
counsel
to
counsel
for
the
charging
parties.
now,
let
me
come
to
the
facts
of
this
case
very
briefly.
in
this
case,
sears
filed
--
sears,
roebuck
the
respondent
filed
with
the
regional
director
a
charge
against
a
union
alleging
that
the
union
had
refused
to
bargain.
that
alleged
refusal
of
the
bargain
whether
there
was
a
refusal
to
bargain
turned
upon
whether
sears
had
properly
withdrawn
from
a
multi-employer
unit
prior
to
the
time
that
bargaining
began.
this
is
a
matter
of
some
dispute
within
the
board.
there's
a
lot
of
board
precedents
on
this,
a
lot
of
litigation
on
this
as
to
just
when
an
employer
or
a
union
may
withdraw
from
multi-unit
bargaining.
the
regional
director
referred
this
case
to
the
general
counsel
for
advice.
the
next
thing
that
we
know
by
the
record
is
that
the
regional
director
advised
sears
that
he
was
not
filing
a
complaint
on
the
case.
sears
then
appealed
this
to
the
general
counsel
and
the
general
counsel
reversed
and
advised
sears
that
a
complaint
would
be
filed
stating
and
as
again,
coming
back
to
what
i
said
a
minute
ago
that
this
case
raised
issues
warranting
board
determination.
that's
at
page
32
of
the
appendix
and
then
the
board,
the
regional
director
subsequently
issued
a
complaint.
now,
prior
to
the
time
that
sears
appealed
from
the
regional
director's
refusal
to
issue
a
complaint
to
the
general
counsel.
it
requested
the
general
counsel
to
furnish
it
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
with
three
things.
first,
the
advice
memorandum
that
the
general
counsel
had
submitted
to
the
regional
director
advising
it
not
to
issue
a
complaint
in
this
case.
secondly,
all
advice
and
appeals
memoranda
relating
to
the
same
subject
that
is
the
timeliness
of
employer
withdrawal
from
multi-employer
bargaining
units.
all
of
those
appeals
and
advice
memoranda
rendered
within
the
past
five
years.
and
third,
an
index
or
a
digest
to
the
advice
and
appeals
memoranda,
what
it
stated
was
it
needed
this
information
in
order
to
successfully
prosecute
its
appeal
to
the
general
counsel.
the
general
counsel
refused
to
furnish
these
memoranda
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
relying
on
exemptions
5
and
7
of
the
act
which
is
that
i
will
discuss
shortly,
and
also
saying
that
these
memos
were
not
a
final
disposition
of
the
case
but
were
merely
guides
to
the
regional
directors
on
how
to
prosecute
the
case.
sears
then
filed
this
action
in
the
district
of
columbia
district
court
to
obtain
this
information.
while
the
case
was
pending
before
the
district
court,
the
general
counsel
of
the
labor
board
announced
that
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
not
because
it
was
required
by
the
freedom
of
information
act,
that
he
was
going
to
make
available
to
the
public
copies
of
all
of
the
appeals
and
advice
memoranda
in
so-called
close
cases.
that
is
cases
where
the
board
proceeding
had
been
completed.
he
stated
that
he
was
doing
this
in
order
to
provide
the
public
and
the
labor
board
with
further
information
as
to
how
this
office
was
functioning.
both
sides
in
this
case
moved
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
granted
sears
motion
and
entered
a
rather
broad
order
set
forth
at
pages
9
to
10
of
the
record
which
directed
the
board's
general
counsel
to
provide
all
advice
and
appeals
memoranda.
sears
had
broadened
its
claim
in
its
complaint
so
we
were
directed
to
produce
all
advice
and
appeals
memoranda
for
the
past
five
years
including
anything
incorporated
by
reference
and
those
things,
that
is
if
for
example
as
we
read
the
order,
if
the
order
directed
them
to
produce
an
appeals
memorandum
and
the
appeals
memorandum
said
for
reasons
stated
in
the
regional
director's
memorandum,
we
conclude
we
will
not
--
it
was
not
to
authorize
complaint
in
this
case,
that
would
have
to
be
produced.
they
also
--
it
also
said
that
where
it
used
some
vague
language
such
as
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
general
counsel
have
to
explicate
that
and
explain
exactly
what
was
meant.
now,
let
me
say
that
this
kind
of
thing
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
as
set
forth
and
the
reasons
given
in
the
appeals
memoranda
or
the
advices
of
the
--
the
request
for
advice
from
the
regional
director.
this
is
just
some
kind
of
shorthanded
phrases
within
in
the
informal
administrative
procedure
that
is
followed.
what
is
done
in
this
situation
is
the
parties
the
general
counsel
is
dealing
with
the
people
in
the
regional
director's
office
and
the
region
they
are
familiar
with
these
things.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
may.
it
may
mr.
justice
because
when
they
--
what
he
said
was,
that
defendants
produce
explanatory
material
including
existing
documents.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
10
(a)
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
where
the
district
court's
opinion
defend
its
produced
explanatory
material
including
existing
documents
and
those
instances
were
advice
or
appeals
memoranda
rely
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
case
or
some
other
vague
and
imprecise
reference
without
delineating
what
those
circumstances
are
except
where
they
can
demonstrate
that
these
documents
are
exempt
under
the
act
which
seems
to
us
just
leaves
the
thing
very
far-reaching.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
may
well
be.
for
example,
if
some
of
the
basis
for
the
action
of
the
general
counsel's
office
was
in
discussions
--
in
formal
discussions
are
telephone
conversations,
they
had
with
the
people
in
the
regional
office
would
sometimes
happens.
i
assume
they
would
have
to
unless
they
could
show
that
these
was
exempt
they
would
have
to
make
this
available.
they
might
have
to
reduce
to
writings
some
of
the
things
if
they
had
some
notes.
they
might
have
to
make
this
into
a
formal
memorandum.
the
court
of
appeals
summarily
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
also
cited
its
opinion
in
the
grumman
case,
which
is
another
freedom
of
information
case
to
be
argued
immediately
after
this
case.
now
in
the
freedom
of
information
act,
what
congress
has
done
is
to
provide
three
different
categories
of
information
that
are
subject
to
production.
first
is
one
category
which
has
to
be
published
in
the
federal
register.
then
there's
another
category
consisting
of
three
components
which
has
to
be
produced
and
indexed.
finally,
there
is
a
third
category
of
identifiable
records
which
just
have
to
be
produced.
but
then
the
act
goes
on
in
subsection
(b)
and
list
nine
specific
categories
to
which
it
says
the
act
does
not
apply.
our
submission
to
this
court
is
that
three
of
those
exemptions
cover
this
material.
and
if
we
are
right
in
that,
if
we
are
right
on
any
one
of
those,
if
any
one
of
those
exemptions
covers
this
material,
that
of
course
is
the
end
of
the
case.
you
never
have
to
reach
the
argument
upon
which
sears
relies
so
heavily
that
these
documents
are
comprehended
within
the
three
subcategories
which
are
required
to
be
published
and
indexed.
and
so
i
will
addressed
primarily
and
perhaps
exclusively
depending
how
the
time
runs
the
reasons
why
we
think
the
exemptions
cover
this
and
we
have
discussed
the
other
issues
fully
in
our
brief.
our
principal
reliance
and
our
reliance
in
the
lower
court
was
on
exemption
number
5
which
was
before
this
court
two
terms
ago
in
the
mink
case
which
provides
for
interagency
or
intra-agency
memorandums
or
letters
which
would
not
be
available
by
law
to
a
party
other
than
an
agency
in
litigation
with
the
agency.
there's
no
question
that
these
are
intra-agency
memoranda.
this
provision
of
the
act,
i
might
add,
is
on
page
14
(a)
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
also
will
be
found
at
page
56
of
our
brief
on
the
merit.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
conceded
that.
we
conceded
that
in
the
district
court
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
if
i
may
say,
we
don't
concede
it
but
we
don't
contest
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
for
this
purposes
of
this
case,
although
if
we
didn't
raise
anything
because
we
conceded
in
the
district
court.
i
think
an
argument
could
be
made
that
he
isn't,
but
we're
not
making
that
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
we
argued
first
the
exemptions
and
then
we
argued
the
earlier
part
of
it.
the
distinction
between
them
is,
if
we
lose
on
the
exemptions
under
subparagraph
3,
all
we're
required
to
do
is
to
produce
them.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
come
within
any
of
the
three
subcategories
of
the
earlier
part
of
the
act
which
we
don't
think
apply
were
required
not
only
to
produce
them
but
also
to
index
them.
so
that
our
reliance
is
first,
we
say
we
don't
have
to
produce
them
because
they're
exempt.
secondly,
we
say
if
we
do
have
to
produce
them,
if
we
do
have
to
produce
them,
they're
not
under
subparagraph
2
which
are
the
three
categories
but
under
subparagraph
3
with
respect
to
which
there
is
no
indexing
required.
but
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
may
or
may
not
have
been.
but
we're
not,
i
want
to
make
clear,
we're
not
charging
--
contesting
that
in
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
that
there
some
legislative
history
suggesting
that
perhaps
congress
did
not
intend
to
deal
with
subcategories.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
would
certainly
be
identifiable
records
under
page
--
on
page
55
of
our
brief
subparagraph
3.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
522
(a)
(3),
they'd
be
identifiable
records.
it's
also
contended
that
they
are
final
opinions
and
this
is
on
page
--
subparagraph
2
at
page
54
final
opinions
made
in
the
adjudication
of
cases,
statements
of
policy
and
interpret
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
say
they
are
not
any
of
those
three.
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
yes,
we
do.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
he
doesn't
run
the
final
opinions
because
he
doesn't
adjudicate.
these
are
not
interpretations
which
the
general
counsel
has
adopted.
this
isn't
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
because
we
think
that
as
used
in
the
freedom
of
information
act,
what
congress
was
referring
to
was
a
determination
of
the
legal
issue.
and
the
general
counsel
has
not
determined
the
legal
issue
when
he
refuses
to
issue
a
complaint.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
might
be.
we
would
--
it
might
be
but
we
would
contest
it
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think,
i
think
it
has.
i
think
in
determining
whether
if
something
is
an
adjudication
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
you
have
to
look
at
the
purposes
of
that
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
--
i
would
say
not
in
all
cases.
and
we
also
think
finally
that
these
are
not
administrative
instructions
to
staff
because
the
legislative
history
shows
that
administrative
instructions
--
that
administrative
instructions
was
put
in
there
that
specific
modifying
word
was
put
in
there
to
make
it
clear
that
this
dealt
with
administrative
matters
and
not
instructions
relating
to
law
enforcement
or
litigation.
let
me
just
come
to
what
the
court
said
in
mink
about
exemption
5.
what
the
court
said
in
mink
in
exemption
5
was
that,
“their
congress
incorporated
the
special
and
subtle
rule
that
confidential
intra-agency
advisory
opinions
are
not
privileged
from
inspection
and
that
the
question
in
each
case
is
whether
production
of
the
contested
documents
would
be
injurious
to
the
consultative
functions
of
government
that
the
privilege
of
nondisclosure
protects.”
it
also
said
that,
“congress
in
this
exemption
was
intended
to
permit
discovery
of
purely
factual
matters
appearing
in
government
documents
that
could
be
separated
out
from
the
nonfactual.”
now,
we
think
that
these
documents,
we
think
of
the
essence
of
government
consultative
functions.
this
is
the
way
within
the
general
counsel's
office
advice
is
set
out
to
the
field
on
whether
to
prosecutor
case,
how
to
prosecute
a
case,
what
theory
is
to
be
followed.
the
documents
--
these
are
not
documents
in
which
you
can
separate
out
the
factual
from
the
nonfactual.
they
are
intertwined.
they
are
inextricably
intertwined
because
of
theory
of
the
case
is
tied
with
the
facts.
indeed,
when
the
people
in
the
general
counsel's
office
marshaled
the
facts,
explained
the
facts,
that
itself
is
the
essence
of
a
lawyer's
job.
he
looks
at
the
facts,
decides
how
to
present
the
facts
in
a
way
that
will
be
most
effective.
it's
really
either
is
or
is
certainly
analogous
to
the
lawyers
work
product
which
traditionally
is
not
available
in
discovery.
and
indeed,
i
think
it's
very
revealing
at
page
131
of
the
record
in
this
case,
that
sears
itself
apparently
recognized
that
these
documents
are
being
sought
for
something
more
than
just
information.
they
wanted
them
as
they've
said
in
order
to
help
prepare
to
litigate
this
case,
first
to
take
the
appeal
and
then
to
litigate
it
before
the
board.
at
page
131,
a
letter
in
which
sears
requested
the
general
counsel
to
extend
the
time
for
its
hearings
stated,
“that
we
need
this
material
to
prepare
witnesses
prior
to
the
board
hearing.”
well,
any
lawyer
would
be
delighted
if
he
could
have
access
to
the
material
in
his
opponent's
files
showing
how
his
opponent
was
going
to
try
the
case,
what
its
strategy
was,
how
he
feel
the
evidence,
how
we
would
marshal
it.
that
we
submit
is
precisely
the
kind
of
information
that
congress
intended
to
protect
against
disclosure
in
exemption
5
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
a
[laughter
attempt]
unfortunately,
it's
a
difficult
subject.
there
have
been
recent
amendments
attempting
to
clarify
but
there
are
none
of
the
recent
amendments
deals
with
exemption
5,
i
may
say
mr.
justice.
it's
a
difficult
think
and
i
think
basically,
you
got
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
congress
in
these
amendments.
that
this
congress
recognized
that
there
was
a
strong
public
interest
in
making
things
public
but
also
that
government
couldn't
operate
in
a
fishbowl
and
that
in
certain
instances,
it
was
important
to
preserve
the
confidentiality
of
government
material.
