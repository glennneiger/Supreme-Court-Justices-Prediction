mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
beginning,
i
would
like
to
spend
some
time
in
responding
to
mr.
friedman's
arguments.
but
perhaps,
i
ought
first
to
give
the
court
just
a
basic
outline
of
what
our
position
is.
and
that
is,
it
is
our
position
as
opposed
to
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
that
if
the
documents
in
question
fall
within
2
(a)
(b)
or
(c)
of
the
freedom
and
are
required
to
be
disclosed
as
either
final
opinions
in
adjudication
statements
of
policy
or
administrative
instructions
affecting
staff?
then,
you
never
reach
the
exemptions
because
they
are
--
the
exemptions
in
so
far
as
the
kinds
of
documents
involved
here
are
mutually
exclusive
for
the
reason
that
your
honor,
if
in
fact,
these
are
declarations
of
substantive
law
and
obviously,
i
have
to
develop
that
whole
point,
and
if
this
is
an
agency
which
has
been
conceded.
and
these
are
the
declarations
of
this
agency
then
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
very
basic
principles
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
to
permit
an
agency
simply
by
passing
documents
back
and
forth
to
create
the
very
kind
of
secret
law
which
the
freedom
of
information
act
was
designed
to
avoid.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
your
honor,
in
answer
to
that
question.
i
must
confess
to
begin
that
in
terms
of
the
specifics
of
all
of
the
various
agencies
that
might
or
might
not
be
affected
by
a
decision
here,
i
cannot
speak
for
it.
but
i
can
answer
it
in
this
fashion,
that
the
record
does
reflect
what
types
of
documents
are
involved
here.
and
the
kinds
of
documents
which
you
admitted,
the
documents
--
the
procedure
that
we
follow
here
was
before
the
mink
case
that
we
agreed
upon
representative
samples
of
the
kinds
of
documents
after
12
weeks
of
going
through
the
documents
in
the
general
counsel's
office
and
the
advice
memos
when
in
fact
documents
that
he
gave
us
and
the
appeals
memos
were
documents
that
we
found.
these
very
documents
however,
do
not
deal
with
the
kinds
of
information
that
mr.
friedman
speaks
of.
perhaps,
except
in
rare
occasion.
they
do
not
speak
of
trial
tactics.
they
do
not
speak
of
settlements.
they
do
not
--
they
do
one
thing.
they
informed
the
public
or
the
parties
as
this
presently
the
case
as
to
what
the
law
is.
now,
i
would
submit
and
ask
you
a
question
your
honor,
if
the
justice
department
as
a
prosecutorial
agency
were
to
inform
people
as
to
what
the
law
is.
in
other
words,
only
the
basis
of
their
proceeding,
not
the
how,
not
the
witnesses,
not
how
they
are
going
to
try
the
case,
that's
what's
involved
here.
and
maybe,
that
in
the
nature
of
justice
department,
other
agency
proceedings,
the
instructions
or
the
trial
tactics
or
the
names
of
witnesses,
or
the
facts
may
be
so
intertwined
that
for
that
reason,
those
agencies
documents
may
not
have
to
be
produced
and
may
fall
under
one
of
the
exemptions.
but
in
this
case,
where
the
documents
are
pure
and
pristine,
questions
of
law
and
where
the
district
court
judge
quite
correctly
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
struck
and
said
that
settlements,
discussions,
names
of
witnesses
or
anything
else
that's
exempt
can
be
eliminated
from
the
documents.
and
they
can
in
the
nature
of
this
documents
then
i
submit
that
we
don't
have
a
problem
in
terms
of
the
very
kinds
of
fears
that
mr.
friedman
quite
properly
sets
forth.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
i
would
submit
that
those
are
the
very
types
of
consultative
functions
that
would
be
exempt
under
exemption
of
b
(5).
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
well,
because
the
very
nature
of
the
hypothetical
you
gave
me
your
honor
is
one
that
deals
with
instructions
which
are
not
involved
in
this
case.
this
case
would
be
a
situation
where
the
attorney
general
or
the
u.s.
attorney
would
not
in
washington
however
would
not
give
any
instructions
with
respect
to
how
to
try
the
case,
which
circuit
is
better
but
only
as
to
what
his
view
of
the
law
is.
and
with
respect
to
anything
else,
that
would
remain
confidential
and
not
be
subject
to
disclosure.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
that's
correct.
only
because
and
i
wouldn't
say
that's
true.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
for
this
reason,
your
honor,
i
think
we
read
(a)
(b)
and
(c)
as
being
--
as
referring
to
that
portion
of
a
document
that
is
the
final
opinion
or
the
substantive
law.
the
justice
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist
example
i
would
submit
that
if
those
portions
were
included
in
a
document
that
also
talked
about
what
the
law
was,
then
those
portions
of
the
document
would
not
be
(a)
(b)
or
(c).
they
would
merely
by
identifiable,
as
mr.
friedman
says
under
3
and
then
they
would
be
exempt
under
one
of
the
exemptions
(b)
(5).
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
what
we
are
talking
about
here
your
honor
as
opposed
to
published
opinions,
are
the
secret
law
if
you
will
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
and
i
call
your
honor's
attention
in
that
regard
particularly
to
the
quarterly
report
of
the
general
counsel.
now,
the
general
counsel
and
this
is
on
page
150
of
the
appendix.
now,
the
general
--
and
it
goes
on
and
on.
now,
every
quarter
and
that
was
four
times
a
year,
he
selects
certain
cases,
advice
and
appeals
decisions,
that
he
believes
that
would
be
helpful
if
the
public
knew
how
he
was
proceeding.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
those
cases
cited
in
the
appendix
are
cases
in
--
which
are
open
cases,
cases
in
which
he
is
proceeding.
in
fact,
they
go
to
the
very
point
mr.
justice
rehnquist
made.
he
has
been
able
through
the
device
of
publication,
although
selective
publication,
those
cases
that
each
uses
are
simply
limiting
the
announcements
as
what
the
law
is.
and
it's
also
significant
that
the
general
counsel
has
been
called
--
i
mean
he
has
the
unreviewable
discretion
to
proceed
or
not
to
proceed
and
this
court
is
only
too
familiar
with
the
complexities
of
the
labor
law.
and
in
those
--
in
exercising
those
decisions,
he
essentially
shapes
the
law,
because
by
not
proceeding,
he
makes
as
much
law
as
he
does
by
proceeding.
now,
mr.
friedman
called
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
well,
but
it
is
a
separate
agency.
i
call
your
honor
--
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
yes,
there's
no
question.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
no
question.
in
that
situation,
the
law
is
ultimately
made.
however,
if
he
was
in
error
--
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
that's
correct.
but
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
even
when
the
decision
is
to
proceed
he
makes
law
because
in
the
nature
of
the
way
this
agency
operates,
more
than
90%
of
the
cases
are
settled.
and
so
that,
even
after
he
decides
to
proceed,
the
case
will
be
settled
based
on
the
theory
at
which
the
general
counsel
has
proceeded,
it
never
gets
to
the
board.
some
cases
--
some
settlements
are
reviewed
by
the
board
but
most
of
them
are
informal
in
nature
and
are
not
reviewed
by
the
board.
and
i
also
would
like
to
call
your
honors
attention,
mr.
friedman
made
a
statement
that
when
there's
a
decision
to
proceed
after
this
appeals
process
he
talked
about,
there
is
never
a
memo.
now,
it's
admitted
that
there
is
rarely
a
memo.
but
i
think
a
very
good
case
in
point
is
the
appendix
that
is
to
the
chamber's
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
that
is
about
a
20-page
opinion
of
the
general
counsel.
on
a
case
where
he
is
dismissed
on
appeal
and
--
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
adjudications
for
the
very
reasons
stated
in
your
opinion
this
morning
in
the
itt
case.
the
--
this
is
--
they
are
first
of
all
decisions
made
not
within
an
agency
as
the
10
(k)
proceeding
was
in
that
situation
but
this
is
the
agency.
and
more
importantly,
on
page
15
of
the
slip
opinion
in
that
--
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
well,
that's
not
the
before
this
court
today.
i
would
think
they
would
be
and
--
but
that's
not
my
personal
view
and
not
the
view
of
anyone
else.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
the
statute
makes
them
unreviewable
however
there
was
a
statement
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissent
in
the
lockridge
case
that
indicates
this
court
has
never
pass
upon
that
and
there
are
decision
of
the
dc
circuit
and
other
circuits
that
indicate,
that
they
might
be
reviewable
on
an
abusive
discretion
basis.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
well,
your
honor
the
fact
is
that
they
haven't
been
and
in
fact
we
are
one
of
the
very
few
people
who've
gotten
here
and
to
make
them
public.
i'm
a
member
of
that
aba
committee
that's
been
working
for
10
years
that
mr.
friedman
spoke
about,
they're
trying
to
get
these
matters
produced
and
it's
the
position
of
the
aba
that
they
are
public
and
are
the
law
and
we
haven't
been
successful.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
no,
your
honor
i
do
not.
under
2
(a)
alone,
yes
i
do.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
yes.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
thank
you.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i,
in
resuming
i
think
it
might
be
most
effective
and
efficient
if
we
can
go
right
into
the
heart
of
the
argument
that
respondent
wishes
to
present
to
the
court.
and
that
is,
as
i
outlined
at
the
outset
that
it
is
our
contention
that
the
documents
here
involved
are
the
law
of
the
general
counsel
under
section
a
(2).
and
i
think,
i
want
to
consider
the
three
areas
and
the
first
is,
is
it
a
final
opinion
under
2
(a)?
with
respect
and
of
course
the
area
in
dispute
is
whether
it
is
in
the
final
opinion
in
the
adjudication
of
the
case.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
yes,
your
honor.
i
think,
in
that
regard,
perhaps
i
ought
just
to
say
in
passing
that
while
they
--
mr.
friedman
accurately
described,
they
have
a
different
genesis.
so
far
as
there
effect.
they
are
equal,
they
have
an
equal
effect.
for
example,
in
the
situation,
well
perhaps
the
best
example
i
can
use
is
the
paper
--
the
appeals
memorandum
attached
to
the
chamber's
brief
which
i
briefly
refer
to
as
to
the
appendix
to
the
amicus
brief.
that
memorandum
was
prepared,
it
took
the
general
counsel
probably
the
best
part
of
the
year
of
consultations,
briefs,
from
the
various
parties,
there
are
perhaps
six
of
eight
cases
involving
the
particular
question
under
a
(e)
of
the
act,
a
very
complex
area
which
your
honors
have
before
you
in
the
connell
case.
and
as
a
matter
of
interest
to
the
court,
to
show
the
significance
that
the
unions
in
the
connell
case
placed
upon
us
that's
73-1256,
connell
construction
versus
plumbers
and
steamfitters
local
100.
they
attached
the
identical
memorandum
to
their
--
as
appendix
to
their
brief
to
support
their
position.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
talk
about
whether
there's
merit
to
that
part
at
all.
but
i
think
it's
significant
in
the
connell
case,
that
connell
appendix
also
contains
the
advice
--
the
appeals
letter.
and
then
there
is
the
appeals
memorandum
which
is
essentially
the
document
in
the
chambers
brief
in
the
bonner
case.
now,
the
--
prior
to
this
appeals
memorandum,
however,
these
cases
were
submitted
for
advice.
so,
there
was,
we've
never
seen
that
advice
memorandum.
it
was
a
very
secret
document
and
the
parties
had
to
argue
in
the
dark
as
to
what
the
position
of
the
general
counsel
was.
in
fact,
in
the
very
connell
case,
the
fifth
circuit
at
which
is
before
you
in
that
case.
the
fifth
circuit
was
critical
of
the
general
counsel
for
not
acting.
now,
he
has
it
within
his
prerogative
and
unreviewable
discretion
whether
to
proceed
or
not.
but
the
fact
remains
that
until
this
memorandum
was
published
and
this
general
counsel
in
his
grace
had
decided
to
make
it
available
to
the
bar.
the
bar
had
no
way
of
knowing
for
10
years
or
thereabouts
why
the
general
counsel
refused
to
give
this
question
to
the
board.
and
in
this
instance,
he
of
course
gave
it
to
the
board.
now,
in
an
advice
situation,
the
advice
memorandum
is
every
good
as
final
your
honor
as
the
appeals
memorandum
if
the
party
chooses
not
to
appeal
because
that
it
the
law
whether
or
not
the
party
chooses
to
appeal,
in
the
underlying
sears
case.
for
example,
we
presented
all
argument
i
did
myself
to
the
office
of
the
general
counsel,
and
it
was
because
of
that
oral
and
the
first
time
around
it
was
no
avail.
the
advice
memorandum
was
against
us
and
we
never
did
see
exactly
what
was
in
that
we
have
seen
it
recently
because
the
case
is
now
closed.
but
we
never
did
see
the
advice
memorandum.
as
a
result
when
we
filed
the
appeal,
we
were
arguing
in
the
dark.
now,
the
general
counsel
attempted
to
give
us
some
more
information
as
this
process
went
forward
in
this
case
again
as
a
matter
of
grace
and
i
think
the
appendix
reflects
the
letter
of
the
regional
director
which
is
exhibit
page
21
where
the
regional
director
after
we
made
the
demand
for
the
advice
memorandum
the
first
time,
indicating
that
we're
proceeding
with
respect
to
the
freedom
information
act.
the
first
paragraph
of
that
letter
states,
“this
letter
sets
forth
with
greater
particularity
my
reason
for
refusing
to
issue
complaint
in
the
above
caption
case,
and
is
sent
pursuant
to
the
teletype
of
july
21,
1971
from
acting
general
counsel
goslee
to
you.”
i
think
that's
very
significant
that
letter
for
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
shows
that
the
director
is
an
essence
a
minister
--
acting
in
a
ministerial
capacity
and
judge
corcoran
below
quite
correctly
made
that
finding
based
on
the
facts
of
these
case
and
these
facts
are
not
unique.
the
records
include
the
operations
of
the
general
counsel
which
is
his
statement
to
the
house
committee
in
1961
which
continue
to
be
so
and
includes
the
lengthy
aba
reports.
i
think
also
this
underlying
case,
and
again
this
page
21
of
the
appendix
points
out
the
fact
that
the
general
counsel
on
three
occasions
changed
his
theory.
now,
he
is
permitted
to
do
that.
we
ultimately
won
because
he
issued
a
complaint
in
our
favor.
but
in
no
time
did
we
really
know
what
his
theory
was
the
first
time,
had
it
no
time
then
we
really
know
what
his
theory
finally
was
when
he
was
going
to
proceed.
so,
it
was
very
difficult
to
act
and
it
certainly
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
other
side
if
they
were
in
disagreement
with
the
basis
of
his
action.
and
yet,
if
we
had
chosen
not
to
file
the
appeal
or
party
chooses
not
to
appeal,
that
is
final.
it's
final
not
only
as
to
that
party.
but
moreover,
it's
final
because
the
law
of
the
advice,
that
is
the
law
of
general
counsel
if
its
not
appeal.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
while
parties
are
informed
of
an
appeals
decision,
parties
are
not
informed
when
the
matter
goes
to
advice.
now,
i
think
sophisticated
practitioners
before
the
board
know
to
ask
the
right
questions
and
if
they
do
ask
they
tell
you.
but
you
might
not
ever
know
when
you
get
a
letter
from
a
regional
director
that
it
was
pursuant
to
an
advice
determination
unless
these
advice
determinations
are
made
public.
now,
i
also
--
in
terms
of
how
the
procedure
works
while
we're
on
the
procedure,
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
appendix,
the
appendix
attached
to
the
respondent's
brief
in
the
case
here
and
particularly
3
(a)
the
second
paragraph
in
that
appendix
--
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
at
page
3
(a)
of
the
respondent's
appendix
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
and
this
is
from
the
admitted
statement
as
to
how
the
office
works
by
the
general
counsel
to
the
house
of
congress.
it
says
in
the
second
paragraph,
secondly,
the
advice
branch
does
not
ordinarily
review
the
regional
director's
factual
determination
and
conclusions.
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
investigatory
duties
of
the
regional
director.
but
rather
it
concerns
itself
with
the
interpretations
and
applications
of
legal
principles.
and
going
on,
your
honors
to
page
4,
the
top
of
the
following
page,
there
are
four
consultative
functions
that
take
place
and
i
talked
about
advice
but
it's
been
ceded
that
the
judge
found
and
this
operations
memorandum,
it's
been
ceded
that
the
appeals
function
essentially
the
same
way
except
that's
on
appeal
rather
than
on
advice.
and
there
are
four
steps
before
this
final
decision
is
rendered
by
the
general
counsel.
step
one
on
page
4
(a),
the
reviewing
attorney
researched
his
all
cases
in
point
and
ascertains
the
applicability
of
prior
advice
determinations.
and
i
should
add
that
while
the
general
counsel
in
the
quarterly
report
in
which
is
published
at
page
150
of
the
regular
appendix,
in
one
of
the
cases
specifically
cites
to
a
prior
quarterly
report
to
a
prior
decision
in
a
prior
quarterly
report.
i
can't
find
it
this
moment,
your
honor
but
it
is
there.
the
second
thing
that
happens
in
this
procedure
is
having
reviewed
the
case,
it
is
then
submitted
for
further
consideration
to
an
advice
agenda
and
then
it
goes
on
to
explain
all
the
people
that
are
at
the
agenda.
and
this
is
essentially
a
conference
where
the
legal
issues
are
better
drawn.
then
it
goes
on
to
say
depending
upon
the
complexity
of
the
case,
cases
may
be
submitted
to
the
agenda
orally
or
by
written
memorandum.
i
should
add
at
the
time
of
this
agenda
takes
place,
the
oral
argument
of
counsel
would
have
been
presented
not
face
to
face
but
separately.
the
legal
positions
of
the
region
were
presented
and
the
submission
of
the
parties
to
the
case
would
have
been
presented.
then
the
agenda
decision,
there's
a
decision
rendered.
the
decision
is
submitted
to
the
general
counsel
and
then
finally
the
second
paragraph
on
4
(a),
the
general
counsel's
final
determination
is
communicated
to
the
regional
office
by
a
way
of
memorandum
from
advice
and
that's
a
memorandum
we're
talking
about
and
the
record
reflects.
there
is
no
instance
nor
instance
in
this
record
where
regional
directors
ever
not
followed
that
advice.
that
advice
obviously
is
a
euphemism
in
the
circumstances.
now,
in
terms
of
why
these
are
final
opinions
and
justice
stewart
--
mr.
justice
stewart
the
same
is
true
of
appeals
and
the
way
it
works.
we
say,
it
essentially
--
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
how
it
shows
it's
always
followed.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
yes,
i
think
it
is
shown
in
a
number
of
ways.
first
of
all,
it
was
essentially
conceded
that
this
is
a
stipulated
record
and
it
was
there
--
it
was
the
government's
burden
and
there
is
no
instance
in
this
record
where
they
produce
any
evidence
to
show
that
it
was
not
followed
--
into
the
advice
decision
was
not
followed
and
moreover,
the
general
counsel
has
conceded
in
his
brief
on
page
6.
and
it
was
also
conceded
earlier
in
the
open
court
that
rarely,
if
ever,
does
a
regional
director
disregard
an
advice
decision.
and
i
think
if
you
think
of
the
nature
of
this
whole
process,
the
general
counsel
indicates
it
requires,
i
don't
want
to
spend
all
the
time
going
through
it,
but
the
words
are
that
it's
required
that
certain
things
be
submitted.
and
there
are
instructions
that
return
from
washington,
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
the
general
counsel
administering
his
41
regions
so
that
a
uniform
--
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
government
brief.
it's
gray,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
now,
let
me
--
if
i
may
come
back
to
the
section
2
(a)
and
why
it's
a
final
opinion.
it's
first
of
all
i
think
it's
been
conceded
as
a
separated
agency
and
an
agency
under
the
apa
not
just
under
the
freedom
information
act.
and
interestingly
of
course,
that
mr.
friedman
tries
to
suggest
perhaps
there
might
be
some
difference
in
the
definition
of
adjudication
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
but
of
course
it's
all
one
act.
the
apa
is
a
part
of
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
the
apa
defines
adjudication
to
mean
agency
process
in
the
formulation
of
an
order.
and
an
order
to
mean
in
whole
or
in
part,
any
part
of
the
final
disposition
of
an
agency,
i'm
turning
to
your
honors'
decision
with
respect
to
the
itt
case
at
page
15
of
the
slip
opinion.
your
honors
state,
when
congress
define
order
in
terms
of
a
final
disposition,
it
required
that
final
disposition
to
have
some
determinate
consequence
for
the
part
to
the
proceeding.
that's
no
question
at
the
consequences
grave
here.
the
party
to
the
proceeding
either
gets
the
remedy
that
he
seeks
or
he
does
not.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
well,
your
honor,
i
must
say
first
of
all
it
is
we
--
our
argument
is
that
it
is
an
agency
and
this
agency
has
the
responsibility
for
making
best
decisions
with
respect
to
the
development
of
the
law
and
this
is
how
it
speaks.
only
through
this
--
in
this
fashion,
when
this
agency
decides
not
to
proceed,
that
is
the
law
of
the
land
there
is
nothing
--
no
individual
in
this
country
can
bring
a
suit
to
change
that
life
the
general
counsel
in
his
wisdom
decides
not
to
proceed.
and
decisions
not
to
proceed
are
every
bit
as
much
the
law
his
decision
to
proceed
and
this
memorandum
simply
explicate
that.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
well,
you
do
in
the
nature
--
you
do
in
the
nature
of
this
agency.
it
may
be
your
honor
in
the
justice
department
it's
different.
the
nature
of
this
agency
having
worked
with
the
agency,
there
--
when
the
document
comes
into
from
the
field,
there's
a
majority
opinion
frequently
a
dissenting
opinion.
there
it
is
said
there's
a
lot
of
due
process
and
justice
within
the
agency
is
just
not
publicized.
and
there
are
dissenting
opinions,
now
i'm
not
sure
they
are
dissenting
opinions
in
the
adjudication
of
this
but
that
of
course,
that's
not
critical.
but
i
would
say
your
honor
that
we
don't
only
rely
on
2
(a).
we
say
that
in
the
alternative,
even
if
its
not
2
(a)
it's
clearly,
it's
clearly
2
(b)
and
then
--
and
2
(b)
is
either
statements
of
policy
specifically
adopted
by
an
agency.
and
the
general
counsel
in
his
quarterly
report
at
page
150
of
the
appendix
specifically
publishes
that
adopted
policy
and
he
states
at
the
opening
--
at
the
opening
of
that
report
in
my
judgment,
this
publication
produces
a
better
informed
labor
bar.
now,
presumably
he
thought
publication
would
help
not
to
interfere
with
law
enforcement.
these
are
open
cases.
if
the
concern
of
your
honor
were
there
and
that
he
may
have
been
wrong
in
his
wisdom,
but
if
you
look
at
the
very
documents
in
issue
here
your
honor,
i
think
you
will
find
that
these
documents
do
not
interfere
with
law
enforcement.
i
think
that
is
certainly
one
of
the
critical
policy
questions.
if
you
take
for
example
a
sample
of
an
appeals
memorandum
a
part
from
the
one
i
had
refer
to
as
on
page
81
of
the
appendix,
very
short
memorandum.
it
cites
the
name
of
the
case.
it
cites
the
disposition.
it
doesn't
give
any
special
information
as
action,
appeal
denied,
reasons
for
action.
in
view
of
the
attached
amendment
to
the
itu
negation
plan,
further
proceedings
would
not
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
act.
so
that's
the
end
of
it.
now,
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
a
collateral
issue
perhaps
is
where
is
that
attached
amendment?
now,
the
--
judge
corcoran
i
think
quite
properly
said
the
word
specifically
referred
to,
we
should
see
it
because
we
were
trying
to
decide
how
we
could
present
our
case
and
if
this
matters
are
final
and
--
or
if
they
are
agency
opinions,
we
are
entitled
to
the
entire
opinion
and
here
this
document
is
appended
and
specifically
identified
and
we
submit
therefore
it
ought
to
be
produced
subject
to
the
general
counsel
showing
why
it
might
fall
with
one
of
the
exceptions.
if
it
does,
for
some
reason
the
document
is
not
final,
it's
a
negotiation
that
might
be
something
else.
we
turn
the
page
on
at
page
83
and
there
we
have
an
advice
memorandum.
unfortunately,
this
record
doesn't
--
indicate
the
headings.
but
that
is
an
advice
memorandum
and
if
you
look
through
it,
it
says
at
the
very
--
in
the
very
first
page
this
was
submitted
for
advice
because
it
is
a
novel
question
of
law
concerning
a
union's
withdrawal
from
multi-union,
multi-employer
bargain.
that
was
the
very
issue
in
the
underlying
sears
case.
we
needed
to
know
this
rational.
this
was
based
on
these
kinds
of
rational
that
we
were
able
to
proceed.
and
just
so
your
honors
are
clear
with
respect
this
appendix
just
as
a
matter
of
housekeeping
starting
at
page
185
to
the
end,
those
--
sorry.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
no,
your
honor.
certainly,
we
can
but
there
are
no
board
decisions.
that's
really
the
problem.
the
last
decision
of
the
board
here
was
probably
10
years
ago.
there's
retail
associates
case.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
right.
but
your
honor,
the
point
is
this
is
how
he
interprets
them
and
he
will
decide
to
proceed
or
not
to
proceed.
in
this
particular
case,
he
decided
not
to
proceed.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
until
our
case
came
along,
the
general
counsel
just
refused
to
proceed
on
re-litigating
the
issue
of
what
constitutes
withdrawal
from
multi-employer
bargaining
on
it.
and
there
was
nothing
you
could
do
to
get
him
to
proceed
in
that
fashion.
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
no,
--
mr.
gerald
c.
smetana
i
think
the
test
your
honor
is
that
there's
no
question
this
is
the
law
of
this
agency,
that's
how
he
proceeds.
and
i
think
the
test
has
been
said
by
the
hawk's
court,
the
sixth
circuit
as
to
whether
or
not
it
will
promote
or
impede
law
enforcement.
and
there's
nothing
in
these
documents
that
in
our
view,
will
impede
the
enforcement
of
the
law.
in
fact,
the
general
counsel
himself
believes
they
promote
the
enforcement
of
the
law.
now,
let
me
turn
very
briefly
if
i
may
to
the
exemptions
and
why
we're
not
covered.
i
have
already
said
that
the
exemptions
are
mutually
exclusive
because
if
in
these
final
substantive
opinions
of
an
agency
then
for
the
agency
simply
if
able
to
pass
them
between
itself
intra-agency
would
create
the
very
body
of
secret
law
which
is
not
desired.
and
mr.
justice
bazelon
of
the
dc
circuit
in
the
sterling
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
essentially
drew
the
distinction
between
formulations
of
policy
and
substantive
declarations
as
to
whether
the
exemption
deployed.
and
we
submit
these
are
clearly
substantive
declarations
of
policy
rather
than
the
formulation
of
the
policy.
the
formulation
is
what
i
described
in
going
through
the
advice
and
appeals
memoranda.
so
far
as
b
(7)
is
concerned,
the
congress
recently
amended
b
(7)
of
the
act
to
specifically
take
out
what's
an
issue
here
because
they
indicated
and
i'm
reading
from
the
new
amendments
of
the
freedom
information
act
b
(7)
investigatory
records
are
exempt
but
only
to
the
extent
such
records
would
interfere
with
law
enforcement
proceedings
which
is
again
the
as
the
hawk's
test.
and
more
importantly,
in
the
conference
report
on
page
12
describing
that
language
the
congress
says,
“nor
is
this
exemption
intended
to
include
records
falling
within
the
scope
of
subsection
52
(a)
(2)
which
is
(a)
(b)
(c)
which
is
the
very
thing
that
we're
talking
about
here.”
thank
you,
your
honors.
