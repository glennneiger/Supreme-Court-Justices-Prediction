justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it.
i
take
it
then
that
the
government
doesn't
contest
the
assertion
that
the
general
counsel
is
an
agency.
justice
byron
r.
white
still
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
we
treat
the
general
counsel
separately
from
the
board
for
purposes
of
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
is
your
argument
just
simply
on
the
exemptions
rather
than
on
the
earlier
part
of
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
i
gather
any
question
whether
the
general
counsel
is
an
agency
would
have
been
resolved
in
any
of
this
by
the
amendment
of
1974?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
keep
going.
any
establishment
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
that
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
--
suppose
none
of
the
exemptions
apply,
under
what
category
specified
in
the
early
part
of
the
act
would
these
memoranda
--
would
advice
or
appeals
memoranda
fall?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
they
are
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
of
those
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
and
you
say
they're
not
opinions?
i
suppose
you
must
mean
that
the
general
counsel
has
no
claimed
opinions
because
he
doesn't
adjudicate?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
there
a
rejection
of
a
complaint
and
adjudication?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
an
adjudication
under
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it
or
isn't
it?
you
don't
think
an
adjudication
--
you
don't
think
the
word
adjudication
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
should
have
the
meaning
and
has
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is,
no
it
doesn't
have
the
meaning
that
it
does?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
agree
mr.
friedman
that
the
statute
is
not
a
very
well
drawn
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
he
proceeds,
it
got
to
be
made
to
the
board,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn't
--
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
the
law
was
going
to
be
--
would
be
made
in
a
--
where
complaint
is
filed.
the
law
is
going
to
be
made
by
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
the
board,
not
by
the
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
really
say
when
he
turns
down,
something
you
say
makes
the
law
but
he
may
reasons
for
turning
them
down,
no
doubt
he
does.
do
you
call
those
reasons
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
ought
to
be
reviewable
then
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
you
to
win
under
2
(a),
you
have
to
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
these
are
adjudication?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
say,
under
--
justice
byron
r.
white
2
(a),
you
must
say
there
are
adjudication.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
issue
in
the
sears
case,
73-1233
is
whether
the
freedom
of
information
act
requires
a
disclosure
upon
request
of
certain
documents
known
as
advice
and
appeals
memoranda
generated
by
the
office
of
general
counsels
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
the
course
of
deciding
whether
or
not
to
permit
the
filing
with
the
board
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
that
the
disclosure
was
required.
we
affirm
insofar
as
the
documents
conclude
that
a
complaint
should
not
be
filed
but
reversed
where
the
conclusion
is
that
the
complaint
should
issue.
our
reasons
for
these
conclusions
are
given
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk.
the
chief
justice
concurs
in
the
result.
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
