justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
wholly
unreviewable,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
appeals
memorandum
is
sent
back
to
the
regional?
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
nobody
else?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
an
appeal
only
in
the
event
the
regional
director
decides
not
to.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
--
what
are
the
mechanics
to
that
appeal?
i
did
not
know
about
that
appeal
before.
justice
potter
stewart
first
of
all
the
regional
director,
i
suppose,
has
to
advise
the
charging
party
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
if
he
decided
not
to.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
how
is
that
appeal
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
just
--
it's
an
ex
parte
appeal,
the
potential
chargee
is
not
defined.
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
the
charging
--
potential
chargee
know
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
first
notice
he
gets?
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
general
counsel
--
with
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
who
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
the
chargee.
justice
potter
stewart
now.
justice
potter
stewart
then
the
regional
director,
if
and
only
if
he
decides
with
or
without
having
sought
it
by
washington
not
to
file
a
complaint
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
and
then
only
is
there
an
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
preliminarily
an
ex
parte
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
later,
there
may
be
or
is
an
opportunity
by
the
potential
chargee
to
be
heard
also
in
washington.
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
all
--
and
it's
done
on
the
papers
but
sometimes
also
on
an
oral
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
long
it
processes
this?
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
given
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
just
before
you
finish.
i
want
to
get
this
procedure.
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
didn't
know
anything
about
that
until
i
read
these
briefs
in
this
case.
then
if
the
general
counsel's
office
upholds
the
decision
of
the
regional
director
not
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
file
a
complaint
then
what?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
end
of
it
and
there's
no
memo
and
there's
nothing
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
no
papers
there
in
that
kind
of
situation
that
are
involve
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
are
none.
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
notice?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
it's
only
in
the
event
that
the
tentative
decision
or
the
decision
of
the
regional
director
is
reversed.
justice
potter
stewart
that
papers
are
produced
that
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
among
others
of
this
lawsuit.
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
is
under
the
statute,
his
ultimate
non-reviewable
decision
that
is
of
the
general
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
just
something
that
this
is
just
delegated
as
a
matter
within
the
bureaucracy
this
portion
of
it
to
the
regional
director,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
has
a
statutory
--
justice
potter
stewart
authority
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
file
a
complaint
if
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
charge
has
been
filed.
justice
potter
stewart
part
of
this
decision.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you
very
much.
justice
potter
stewart
what
page
is
this?
justice
potter
stewart
at
522.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
can
see
that
they
are
identifiable
records?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
your
position
was
just
generally
on
the
law
that
if
a
document
falls
under
the
definition
of
552
(a)
(b)
or
(c),
then
it
is
producible,
you
don't
even
get
to
the
exception.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
yet
--
well,
let
me
just
follow
that
up.
if
you
say
that's
correct
then
of
course
it's
when
--
my
brother
rehnquist's
examples
seem
to
me
gave
you
in
his
hypothetical
a
document
that
probably
would
fall
under
either
(b)
or
(c),
and
yet
you
conceded
that
the
exception
would
be
applicable.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
the
law
is
available
to
you
as
it
is
to
the
criminal
division
if
you're
only
talking
about
published
opinions
of
courts
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
both
the
advice
memorandum
and
the
appeals
memorandum,
you're
lumping
them
together?
