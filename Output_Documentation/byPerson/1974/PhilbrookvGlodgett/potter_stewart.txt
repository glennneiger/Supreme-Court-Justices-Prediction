page
of
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
would
you
make
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
derosia
family.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event,
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
how
large
the
family
is
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
administered
through
the
counties?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it's
some?
justice
potter
stewart
um-huh.
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
is
the
unemployment
compensation
run
in
vermont
52
weeks?
justice
potter
stewart
final
13
weeks?
justice
potter
stewart
so
far
is
just
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
senate
bill
that's
going
into
conference
this
week.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
the
same
criteria?
justice
potter
stewart
for
afdc
uf
unemployed
father?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
he
--
if
he
then
just
left
his
family,
his
children
would
suffer,
this
aid
continue
to
get
afdc
under
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
family
program.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
--
it
is
optional
with
the
state,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
the
uf
program
is
optional
with
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
explicitly
so?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
states
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
about
half,
exactly
half?
justice
potter
stewart
while
i've
interrupted
you,
you
remember
yesterday
from
the
other
end
of
the
bench
there
were
stirrings
about
the
possibility
of
this
not
being
appealable,
this
case
not
being
appealable
with
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
have
you
given
that
thought?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
second
circuit,
we
have
a
case
i
guess
it's
going
to
be
heard
either
today
or
tomorrow,
certain
circuit
issue
as
you
know
as
perhaps
of
this
dichotomize.
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
district
court
decides
a
case
such
as
this
only
the
statutory
ground,
preemption
ground
if
you
will.
justice
potter
stewart
it
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals
even
though
jurisdiction,
the
district
court
is
purely
pendant
because
of
--
by
reason
of
the
constitutional
claim
and
if
the
court
decides
on
unconstitutional
grounds,
comes
directly
here
we,
have
a
case
and
i
said
to
be
argue
tomorrow
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
involving
just
that
kind
of
procedure
that's
been
developed
in
the
second
circuit
and
that
would
suggest
i
suppose
that
if
these
were
in
the
second
circuit
at
least,
this
case
has
decided
by
the
district
court
would've
been
appealable
into
the
court
of
appeals
and
only
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
fact
as
of
now?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
the
second
circuit
premised,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
others
in
constitutional
ground?
justice
potter
stewart
has
this
been
litigated
in
any
other
state,
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
stayed
in
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
no
decision
yet
in
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
so
called
glodgett
plan?
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
total
reduction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
just
an
interim
plan
pending
the
final
decision
of
this
litigation,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
would
your
brief
be
in
support
of
the
position
that
this
case
is
appealable
direct
in
this
court
or
don't
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
mtm
this
morning.
justice
potter
stewart
add
to
a
little
fuel
to
the
fire.
