mr.
richard
s.
kohn
thank
your
honor.
good
morning
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
children
who
are
in
need
due
to
the
unemployment
of
their
fathers
can
be
denied
assistance
under
the
unemployed-fathers
program
solely
because
their
father
is
eligible
for
an
amount
of
an
unemployment
compensation
no
matter
how
small.
the
district
court
applied
the
plain
meaning
of
section
607
(b)
(2)
(c)
(ii)
of
title
42
and
held
that
the
statute
only
applies
to
actual
receipt
and
that
the
father
has
an
option
of
declining
to
accept
his
unemployment
compensation
in
accepting
anfc
uf
if
those
benefits
are
higher.
just
a
few
days
ago,
this
court
in
the
case
of
alcala
versus
burns
applied
the
ordinary
language
rule
and
we
asked
the
court
to
do
that
in
this
case
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
first
of
all,
the
language
of
section
607
(b)
(2)
(c)
(ii)
is
absolutely
clear
refers
to
receipt
of
unemployment
compensation
benefits
is
working
the
disqualification.
the
--
there
are
substantial
evidence
and
other
provisions
of
the
same
statute
that
if
congress
wanted
to
say
eligibility
for
receipt,
they
knew
have
to
do
so.
in
a
statute
--
in
the
section
of
the
statute
immediately
preceding
the
one
at
issue
here
(b)
(1)
(c),
the
court
had
to
--
the
congress
referred
to
eligibility
requirements
for
afdc
and
the
in
the
course
of
that
statute
which
is
enacted
on
the
same
day
as
607
(b)
(2)
(c)
(ii),
the
court
used
the
language
qualified
to
receive
and
refers
to
another
section
of
the
statute
which
defines
that
as
being
eligible
for
the
receipt
of
benefits
upon
the
filing
of
an
application.
so,
it's
perfectly
clear
that
if
the
congress
had
intended
to
refer
to
eligibility
for
receipt
in
the
subsequent
section,
they
could've
done
so
by
referring
to
section
(d)
(3).
also,
in
section
602
which
is
this
court
knows
from
the
alcala
versus
burns
case
has
to
do
with
the
requirements
of
state
plans
which
must
be
included
if
hew
approval
is
to
be
obtained.
there's
a
section
602
(a)
(12)
which
has
to
do
with
receipt
of
all
the
aid
assistance
and
that
provision
says
that
if
a
failing
receipt
or
for
recipient
in
a
household
receives
all
the
aid
assistance
during
the
period
that
he
does
so,
the
family
is
disqualified
or
that
person
cannot
be
included
within
the
assistance
group.
the
legislative
history
of
602
(a)
(12)
which
is
found
in
1950
us
code
in
congressional
administrative
news
at
page
3479,
this
is
not
cited
in
my
brief,
indicates
that
with
respect
to
that
old
aid
assistance
provision,
the
congress
was
clearly
concern
about
double
benefits
that
a
family
should
not
be
able
to
receive
both.
and
since
the
congress
used
the
language
“is
receiving”
in
that
section
and
“are
receives”
in
the
section
before
the
court,
we
think
that
that
is
evidence
that
when
congress
was
concerned
about
double
benefits,
that
was
the
language
they
used.
and
also
in
section
602
(a)
(15)
which
has
to
do
with
providing
advice
to
recipients
of
afdc
about
birth
control,
the
court
specifically
--
the
congress
specifically
used
the
language
“eligible
for
receipt
or
receiving.”
so,
it's
perfectly
clear
from
related
provisions
of
the
act
that
when
congress
wanted
to
refer
to
eligibility
to
receipt
they
could
do
so
and
they
did
on
several
occasions.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
your
honor
the
--
i
find
the
legislative
history
very
confusing.
i
can't
say
that
it
supports
me,
i
can't
say
that
it
goes
against
me.
i
think
it
silence
on
the
point.
the
only
time
that
the
congress
referred
to
this
--
the
disqualification
of
an
unemployment
compensation
benefits
was
in
a
different
context.
they
were
concerned
about
the
situation
where
family
was
receiving
unemployment
compensation,
it
ran
out
in
the
first
week
of
the
month
to
the
second
week
of
the
month
and
under
the
1967
statute,
the
family
was
then
disqualified
from
receiving
any
afdc
for
the
entire
month.
and
that
was
the
question
that
congress
addressed
in
the
legislative
history.
i
asked
the
court
to
apply
the
rule
that
where
the
legislative
history
would
tend
to
confuse
the
issue
or
sheds
no
light
on
it
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statue
should
be
followed.
it's
important
to
recognize
that
until
from
1935
until
1961,
there
was
no
unemployed
fathers
program.
in
1935,
congress
created
the
program,
it
was
an
optional
program
to
be
applied
by
the
states
if
they
desire
too
and
they
also
made
it
optional
in
the
states
is
to
whether
they
wanted
to
supplement
inadequate
unemployment
compensation
benefits
with
afdc
payments.
and
of
the
22
states
that
had
the
program,
all
but
three
permitted
supplementation
of
benefits
and
the
obvious
reason
for
doing
this
was
the
gross
in
equity
of
having
certain
children
who
may
have
received
$20.00
or
$25.00
of
unemployment
compensation
and
then
in
comparison
with
other
families
they
could've
received
several
hundred
dollars
in
terms
of
afdc.
now,
there's
no
question
that
in
1967
--
i
might
add
that
at
the
time
the
1960
amendment
was
enacted,
the
country
was
in
an
economic
recession
and
at
the
same
time
that
congress
enacted
this
provision,
they
also
enacted
the
temporary
extended
unemployment
compensation
act.
so,
it's
clear
that
while
congress
may
have
regarded
unemployment
compensations
the
first
line
of
defense,
after
61
it
was
not
the
exclusive
line
of
defense
and
congress
recognized
that
unemployment
compensations
which
is
not
designed
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
the
family
might
be
inadequate.
in
1962,
congress
had
the
opportunity
to
revoke
the
legislation
or
not
renew
it
and
yet
they
decided
to
continue
it
for
another
five
years.
there's
no
question
that
in
1967,
congress
made
a
change.
they
no
longer
provided
for
the
supplement
but
the
big
question
is
whether
they
intended
to
bar
all
those
families
that
were
receiving
unemployment
compensation
for
many
assistance
or
whether
they
were
going
to
permit
the
family
an
option.
now,
we
argue
that
the
congress
must
have
intended
an
option
not
only
because
the
plain
language
says
so
but
the
equity
demands
it.
and
we
argue
that
this
is
not
--
it
--
this
doesn't
undercut
the
unemployment
compensation
system
and
that
it
certainly
is
designed
to
make
sure
that
all
children
who
are
similarly
situated
are
treated
alike.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
your
honor,
there's
no
question
that
in
--
depending
on
a
particular
situation
the
amount
of
unemployment
compensation
may
exceed
the
amount
of
afdc
and
in
that
situation,
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
your
honor.
it
--
because
unemployment
compensation
depends
entirely
on
the
amount
of
money
that
the
wage
earner
earns
and
if
you
have
a
wage
earner
who's
making
a
good
income
with
a
small
family,
the
amount
of
unemployment
compensation
which
is
set
at
one-half
his
average
weekly
earnings
could
very
well
exceed
the
amount
of
afdc.
but
our
point
is
that
for
low
income
families
and
for
the
afdc
population,
it's
highly
unlikely
that
unemployment
compensations
would
exceed
afdc.
now,
the
state
has
argued
that
the
congress
may
have
intended
that
unemployment
compensation
benefits
in
an
inadequate
amount
could
be
supplement
with
general
assistance
which
is
a
wholly
state
funded
program.
i
would
refer
the
court
--
and
that
that
general
assistance
could
bring
the
family
up
to
the
state
needs
standard.
in
our
--
in
the
appendix
on
pages
29
and
63,
the
court
will
find
certain
interrogatories
that
we
served
on
bert
smith
who
was
a
director
of
afdc
in
vermont
and
his
answers
to
the
interrogatories,
the
answers
are
on
page
63.
and
in
numbers
eight
and
10,
he
was
asked
specifically
whether
general
assistance
would
bring
the
family
up
to
the
state
need
standard.
and
he
responded
that
it
would
be
highly
unlikely.
general
assistance
is
intended
as
a
short
term
resource
to
deal
with
emergency
situations,
it
pays
the
rent,
it
pays
the
oil
bill
but
it's
highly
unlikely
that
it
would
bring
the
family
up.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
each
of
the
--
the
named
plaintiffs
in
our
case
did
receive
a
slight
kind
of
general
assistance
at
some
point
when
they
were
receiving
unemployment
compensation.
and
each
of
those
cases
the
amount
of
the
joint
benefits
was
below
what
they
would've
received
under
afdc.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
exactly
the
same.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
your
honor,
a
recipient
of
afdc
uf
is
required
to
actively
seek
employment
if
he
refuse
to
take
it
the
family
would
be
disqualified.
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that's
true
your
honor
but
it's
my
understanding
that
that's
how
the
program
operates.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
believe
so.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
believe
so.
in
other
words,
a
father
cannot
accept
the
assistance
from
the
state
and
yet
refuse
to
go
to
work
if
the
work
is
offered.
also,
there
is
a
provision
of
the
afdc
statute
which
is
designed
to
encourage
the
man
to
go
to
work.
so,
that
if
he
works
under
a
hundred
hours
a
month,
he
can
--
the
income
he
earns
is
deducted
from
the
afdc
grant
but
his
family
still
receives
benefits
as
long
as
his
earnings
are
below
the
state
need
standard.
but
i
believe
if
he
refuse
to
accept
suitable
work,
there
will
be
a
disqualification.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
would
be
a
consequence
of
the
--
of
interpreting
these
provisions
as
a
mandatory
bar.
fathers
are
actually
encouraged
to
leave
their
families
so
that
the
remnants
can
receive
afdc
under
section
606
and
the
father
can
continue
drawing
his
unemployment
benefits
and
that
would
be
an
absolutely
observed
result.
also,
the
children
who
were
hurt
are
children
whose
fathers
have
been
laid
off
or
who
are
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation.
the
paradox
is
that
if
a
father
quits
his
job
without
good
cause
or
for
some
reason
because
is
ineligible
for
unemployment
compensation,
his
children
actually
benefited
because
they
receive
more
money
and
that's
an
incredible
result.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
i'm
not
sure
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i'm
not
sure
it's
true
with
respect
to
the
uf
program
your
honor.
the
uf
program
is
designed
to
deal
with
the
needs
of
children
who
are
deprived
of
parental
care
support
due
to
the
unemployment
of
the
parent.
like
unemployment
compensation,
the
objective
is
to
try
to
get
the
parent
back
to
work
and
if
there
is
suitable
employment
available
then
once
the
father
goes
back
to
work,
if
he's
working
over
a
hundred
hours
a
month,
the
grant
would
seize.
and
is
the
same
with
unemployment
compensation,
the
big
difference
in
the
program
is
that
one
is
based
on
the
actual
needs
of
the
family
and
the
other
isn't.
the
father
could
have
a
marginal
job
earning
$100.00
a
week,
if
he
becomes
unemployed
he's
entitled
to
a
maximum
of
50
week
--
$50.00
a
week
in
benefits
while
the
family
under
afdc
could
be
eligible
depending
on
its
size
for
many
hundreds
of
dollars.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
that
would
depend
on
the
size
of
the
family
and
other
factors
your
honor.
i
suppose
it's
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
would
expect
in
some
situations
it
might
be
true.
if
the
family
meets
the
eligibility
criteria
for
afdc,
then
the
amount
of
the
grant
depends
on
the
size
of
the
family
and
the
amount
of
rent
they
have
to
pay
in
that
sort
of
thing.
and
in
some
cases,
i
suppose
it
could
exceed
his
earnings.
now,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us,
it
is
a
fact
that
since
1968
when
this
legislation
was
amended
hew
even
though
its
regulations
says
that
it
is
the
receipt
of
benefits
that
works
the
disqualification.
the
secretary
has
interpreted
this
to
mean
eligibility
for
receive
and
the
state
and
the
hew
has
argued
that
this
interpretation
should
be
given
great
weight
by
the
court.
we
would
ask
the
court,
first
of
all
if
it
agrees
with
our
--
and
if
it
agrees
with
the
district
court
that
the
statutory
language
is
plain
then
under
shea
versus
vialpando
there
would
be
no
reason
to
consider
the
secretary's
opinion
on
the
matter.
at
any
rate,
his
interpretation
has
a
clear
variants
with
his
own
regulation
which
does
speak
in
terms
of
receipt
of
assistance.
the
--
in
footnote
4
of
its
brief,
hew
has
suggested
that
one
reason
why
congress
would
not
have
used
the
language
“eligibility
for
receipt”
would
be
that
they
were
concerned
about
a
gap
between
the
time
the
father
applies
for
an
unemployment
compensation
and
the
time
that
it
is
granted
with
the
implication
that
afdc
benefits
should
be
available
to
the
family
within
that
period.
this
maybe
true
in
some
circumstances
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
fairly
rare
situation.
unemployment
compensation
benefits
are
available
after
a
one
week
waiting
period.
this
is
true
in
vermont
and
i
believe
it's
true
in
most
other
states.
under
hew
regulations,
the
state
has
45
days
in
which
to
give
an
eligible
person
his
afdc
money.
in
vermont,
it's
a
30-day
waiting
period
and
in
vermont,
if
there
is
any
kind
of
gap
between
the
time
the
man
applies
for
his
unemployment
benefits
and
the
time
he
gets
them
that
is
taking
cared
of
by
general
assistance
to
tie
them
over.
but
it
certainly
not
the
general
rule
that
any
problem
would
be
created
by
that
hiatus
in
time.
now,
we
have
asked
the
court
that
if
it
should
reverse
the
district
court
on
statutory
ground
that
it
should
reach
and
decide
the
constitutional
question
and
the
--
it's
true
that
the
district
court
did
not
reach
that
question.
however,
it
was
fully
briefed
and
argued
downstairs
unlike
the
alcala
case
it
has
been
briefed
in
this
court
and
we
would
argue
that
the
exigencies
of
the
economic
situation
require
the
court
to
go
ahead
and
decide
that
issue.
the
case
will
affect
25
states
that
have
the
uf
program
and
there
are
many
thousands
of
children
who
would
be
affected.
we
believe
that
the
standard
review
was
that
--
that
was
enunciated
in
the
marino
case
and
some
have
argued
that
that
is
sort
of
a
strict
rationality
standard
and
that
the
government
must
show
that
whatever
objective
the
provision
serves
must
be
furthered
by
the
statutory
classification.
and
it's
our
contention
that
this
statutory
classification
serves
no
governmental
purpose.
and
certainly
doesn't
serve
the
purposes
of
the
afdc
uf
program
which
was
designed
to
take
care
of
needy
children
and
even
if
you
--
even
if
one
of
the
objectives
was
to
try
to
make
parents
self-supporting
and
get
them
back
to
work
that's
taking
cared
of
by
provisions
within
the
afdc
statute.
the
government
has
argued
that
one
rational
basis
would
be
that
there's
been
a
historical
reliance
on
unemployment
compensation
as
the
first
line
of
defense
for
unemployment.
i
would
say
that
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
we
would
concede
that
congress
has
not
have
to
and
not
the
uf
program
if
they
choose
not
to
and
that
there
are
distinctions
that
could
be
drown
between
that
and
the
situations
described
in
section
606.
but
once
congress
has
recognized
the
problem
and
enacted
an
unemployed-fathers
program
it
can't
then
divide
that
class
of
children
into
sub
groups
based
on
whether
the
father
receives
a
source
--
some
income
from
a
certain
source
and
if
that
is
a
--
as
irrational
if
they
exclude
a
red
headed
families
from
the
--
from
that
group.
also,
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
while
at
one
time
an
unemployment
compensation
was
considered
the
first
line
of
defense.
certainly
was
--
could
no
longer
be
said
that
that
was
true
after
1961
when
congress
specifically
recognized
that
that
unemployment
compensation
could
be
supplemented.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i'm
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
at
the
present
time
25
states
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
i
have
your
honor.
in
my
judgment,
the
appeal
was
properly
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
three-judge
court.
some
members
of
the
court
yesterday
referred
to
a
prior
decision
of
the
court
involving
this
supremacy
clause
and
suggested
that
issue
had
been
settled
many
years
ago.
i
think
the
court
was
referring
to
the
swift
versus
wickham
case.
a
few
weeks
after
swift
was
decide,
the
court
decided
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
versus
chicago
rock
island
pacific
railroad,
382
u.s.
at
423
and
unlike
swift
which
dealt
solely
with
a
preemption
issue,
the
brotherhood
of
locomotive
engineers
case
involved
an
attack
based
both
on
a
preemption
issue
and
the
constitutional
ground.
the
three-judge
court
was
convened,
they
did
not
decided
the
constitutional
ground.
they
only
decided
the
preemption
issue
and
appeal
was
taken
direct
to
this
court
from
that
judgment
and
the
court
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction.
and
specifically
distinguish
the
swift
case
on
the
grounds
that
in
that
case
no
constitutional
issue
had
been
presented.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
if
the
three-judge
court
in
this
case
had
dissolved
itself
and
sent
this
back
to
be
decided
by
a
single
judge
and
the
appeal
would
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
sir.
then
the
appeal
would
have
--
latter,
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
but,
if
this
court
were
to
decide
that
a
direct
appeal
can
be
taken
to
this
court
from
a
three-judge
court
only
when
the
three-judge
court
has
decided
the
constitutional
issue,
that
would
be
a
radical
departure
from
prior
decisions
of
the
court.
in
hagans
v.
lavine,
this
court
has
dictum
which
states
precisely
the
contrary.
in
the
case
of
gonzales
versus
automatic
employees
credit
union
which
i
believe
was
the
most
recent
case
to
deal
with
it.
the
court
expressly
--
that
had
to
do
with
a
case
where
the
three-judge
court
had
denied
injunctive
relief
and
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that's
correct
and
but
the
court
expressly
said
that
the
decision
would
not
have
an
impact
on
cases
where
the
court
grants
an
injunctive
relief
and
just
as
a
practical
matter,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
policy
of
the
expedited
appeal
procedure
is
--
if
a
federal
--
a
lower
federal
court
has
decided
a
case,
issued
an
injunction
which
arguably
paralyzes
the
federal
statute
and
arguably
as
against
the
express
intent
of
congress,
then
it's
important
that
the
issue
will
be
resolved
immediately.
whether
the
court
does
that
on
constitutional
grounds
or
statutory
ground,
i
find
a
very
--
i
have
a
difficult
time
understanding
why
that
should
make
a
difference.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
by
the
state
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
it
could
be
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
i'd
like
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that's
correct
your
honor
but
as
in
this
case
where
the
court
--
the
district
court
applied
the
ordinary
language,
well,
it
seem
to
absolutely
clear
that
what
congress'
intention
was.
now,
under
those
circumstances
what
--
why
should
the
order
of
the
state
pending
an
appeal
through
the
circuit
and
to
the
court
of
appeals
which
may
take
a
year
and
a
half.
i
might
say
that
in
our
case,
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
there
is
a
discretionary
aspect
your
honor,
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
--
i
understand
that.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
oh,
i
do
your
honor.
i've
alleged
that
--
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
quite
possibly.
we
--
i've
briefed
these
issues
your
honor.
i've
argued
jurisdiction
on
many
alternative
grounds.
i
think
we
can
come
here
on
1331.
i
should
say
that
just
on
this
point
that
after
the
district
court
made
a
decision
in
this
case
which
essentially
provided
the
family
with
an
option,
the
--
on
the
agreement
of
the
parties
--
the
state
moot
for
a
state
as
was
just
suggested.
the
court
was
unwilling
to
do
that
and
the
parties
agreed
that
instead
of
the
option
pending
the
appeal,
unemployment
benefits
would
be
treated
like
any
other
resource.
and
since
january
of
74
in
the
state
of
vermont
that
the
family
becomes
eligible
for
an
unemployment
compensation,
he
goes
over
the
welfare
office
and
they
give
him
a
supplement
up
to
the
state
need
standard.
if
the
court
had
not
granted
the
conditional
stay
and
just
said,
“no,
i've
made
--
we've
made
our
decision
and
the
option
is
going
to
apply
now.”
i
think
the
government
would
argue
that
that
would
be
a
catastrophic
result.
and
this
is
the
problem
when
the
appeal
has
to
--
went
its
way
through
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
situation
like
this.
also,
there
are
great
public
interest
verifications.
there
are
25
states
involved
in
every
state
but
vermont
right
now,
any
child
whose
father
is
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation
is
being
denied
benefits
and
that's
an
issue
that
should
be
revolved.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
there's
only
one
other
case
pending
that
i
know
of
your
honor
in
the
state
of
maryland
and
my
understanding
is
that
it's
been
stayed
pending
a
decision
on
the
merits
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
no
decision
and
i
don't
know
whether
injunctive
relief
has
been
granted
but
i
doubt
it.
the
final
question
that
i'd
like
to
address
if
i
have
a
moment
is
a
mootness
question.
the
class
action
in
this
case
was
not
certified
as
a
form
of
class
action
by
the
district
court.
and
when
the
sosna
case
and
the
jacob's
case
came
out,
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
clerk,
i
advised
him
of
this
and
also
filed
an
affidavit
by
one
of
our
named
plaintiffs
and
her
name
is
sarrison
who
is
presently
receiving
unemployment
compensation
under
this
so
called
glodgett
plan.
i
believe
that
that
saves
the
case
from
mootness
and
i
would
also
argue
that
even
if
it
doesn't
and
even
if
mr.
sarrison
should
go
back
to
work
within
the
next
month
or
so
that
this
is
the
type
of
problem
that's
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.
when
a
man
becomes
eligible
for
unemployment
and
still
drawing
it,
one
of
two
things
will
happen,
either
he
will
go
back
to
work
long
before
the
issue
could
be
resolved
in
the
supreme
court
or
he'll
exhaust
his
benefits
and
was
brought
out
yesterday
with
the
emergency
situation
because
of
the
recession
the
benefit
period
is
39
weeks
with
the
emergency
legislation
passed
by
congress
is
up
to
52
but
it's
highly
unlikely
that
a
case
could
come
to
this
court
in
that
period
of
time.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
your
honor
that's
true
but
it's
my
feeling
that
the
named
plaintiff
has
a
right
to
vindicate
his
claims
and
that
i'm
not
sure
that
simply
because
he
is
permitted
to
bring
a
class
action
that
would
affect
other
people
that
that
would
undercut
the
exceptions
for
mootness
doctrine.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
well,
sosna
only
dealt
with
the
class
action
situation
your
honor
and
it
didn't
get
into
the
exception
to
the
mootness
doctrine
that
this
court
enunciated
in
southern
pacific
versus
icc
and
more
of
the
oglebay
where
you
were
dealing
with
the
specific
name
plaintiff.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
yes
sir
and
we
would
argue
that
the
families
that
we
represent
are
locked
in
a
cycle
of
poverty.
it's
highly
likely
that
they
will
be
often
on
this
program
for
the
foreseeable
future
particularly
with
the
recession.
and
we
have
some
figures
which
are
at
this
time
are
not
a
part
of
the
record
of
the
court
but
i'll
be
glad
to
file
it
showing
the
history
of
each
of
these
families,
these
are
figures
that
were
compiled
by
the
department
social
welfare
in
vermont
and
you
will
see
that
in
fact
there
were
periods
of
unemployment,
they
would
go
off
unemployment,
go
to
work
for
several
months
and
then
they
would
be
back
on
again.
and
it
certainly
the
situation
of
mr.
sarrison
who
was
unemployed
from
january
74
until
june
of
74,
worked
from
june
of
74
until
november
of
74
and
since
that
time
has
been
unemployed
and
is
receiving
assistance.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
the
glodgett
plan
is
a
plan
that
was
formulated
in
vermont
your
honor
after
the
district
court's
decision.
under
the
glodgett
plan,
instead
of
the
options
taking
effect,
a
family
that's
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation
is
permitted
to
accept
those
benefits
and
then
go
over
to
the
welfare
department
where
he
gets
a
supplement
to
bring
him
up
to
the
state
need
standard.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
s.
kohn
and
the
effect
of
it
is
to
do
exactly
what
would've
been
done
had
the
court
resolved
this
case
on
constitutional
grounds.
all
they're
doing
is
treating
unemployment
compensation
as
a
resource,
the
same
way
they
would
work
on
this
for
veteran's
benefits
or
any
thing
else.
i
think
it's
all
i
have.
thank
you.
