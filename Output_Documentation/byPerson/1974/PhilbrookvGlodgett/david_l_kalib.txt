mr.
david
l.
kalib
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
david
kalib
and
i
represent
appellant
philbrook
and
the
state
of
vermont
in
this
action.
vermont's
position
is
that
an
unemployed
father
is
excluded
from
receiving
public
assistance
benefits
under
the
unemployed
father
segment
of
the
afdc
program
if
he's
either
eligible
to
receive
or
is
currently
receiving
unemployment
compensation
benefits
and
this
position
is
primarily
based
upon
our
understanding
of
congressional
intent
that
was
incorporated
into
the
january
1968
amendments
for
the
social
security
act.
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
in
1967
considered
a
vast
number
of
amendments
to
that
act
and
they
expressed
an
intent
in
their
committee
report
to
cut
federal
spending
by
reducing
the
public
assistance
roles.
in
addition
for
cutting
the
federal
spending,
they
wish
to
get
public
assistance
recipients
back
into
the
way
before
us.
the
1967
house
senate
conference
committee
also
considered
the
same
vast
number
of
amendments
for
the
social
security
act.
they
looked
at
two
versions
of
how
to
treat
unemployment
compensation
in
relationship
to
public
assistance
benefits.
first,
there
was
a
senate
version
which
retains
the
option
of
allowing
states
to
supplement
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
the
house
version
on
the
other
hand
denied
assistance
to
any
unemployed
father
who
was
receiving
unemployment
compensation.
this
house
senate
conference
committee
recommended
to
the
congress
the
adoption
of
the
version
formulated
by
the
house
ways
and
means
committee
namely
the
version
that
denied
benefits
to
any
unemployed
father
who
was
receiving
unemployment
compensation.
thus,
it's
pretty
clear
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
enact
the
version
to
reduce
federal
spending
and
at
the
same
time
cute
the
welfare
roles.
and
in
addition,
this
conference
committee
report
recognized
that
the
word
“received”
was
either
equivalent
to
or
equated
with
the
term
qualified
to
receive.
since
1968
--
mr.
david
l.
kalib
i
think
you
would
run
into
other
problems.
it
would
still
go
against
the
mandatory
bar
in
section
607
if
you
establish
that
and
i
think
we'd
be
in
trouble
with
federal
matching
funds
in
violation
of
the
afdc
program.
since
1968,
the
department
of
health
education
welfare
along
with
the
state
of
vermont
and
then
i
cannot
speak
for
any
other
states
but
on
the
best
information
i
have,
they've
all
been
interpreting
this
congressional
intent
to
exclude
a
father
who
has
not
developed
and
exhausted
his
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
in
other
words,
if
he
is
eligible
for
those
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
he
must
go
there
first
and
exhaust
those
benefits
prior
to
any
application
for
public
assistance.
the
district
court
decision
which
formulated
an
option
plan
of
allowing
the
recipient
equally
eligible
for
both
programs
to
reject
the
lower
benefit,
i
think
in
terms
of
the
district
court's
decision
it
was
phrased
that
if
his
afdc
benefit
is
higher
he
can
reject
the
unemployment
compensation
benefits
and
vice
versa.
this
goes
against
and
completely
contrary
to
the
congressional
intent
of
reducing
federal
spending.
it
even
goes
beyond
the
senate
version
of
restoring
the
option
of
allowing
states
to
supplement
and
the
senate
version
was
ultimately
rejected
by
congress.
the
district
court
plan
also
establishes
an
either/or
alternative
and
that
is
the
unemployed
father
completely
rejected
his
unemployment
compensation
and
rely
100%
on
public
assistance
to
meet
the
needs
of
his
children
and
there
is
nothing
that
we
can
find
in
legislative
intent
to
create
that
scheme.
we
think
that
congress
realized
that
this
purpose,
the
mandatory
bar
provision
could
be
accomplished
by
a
joint
reading
of
section
402
and
section
407
of
the
social
security
act.
section
402
mandates
each
state
to
require
each
applicant
for
public
assistance
to
develop,
utilize
and
exhaust
all
his
benefits,
excuse
me,
all
his
income
and
resources
that
are
available.
if
we
start
with
that
premise
and
say
that
an
individual
who
was
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits
must
go
down
and
develop
and
utilize
those
benefits
and
he
does
so,
section
407
of
the
social
security
act
precludes
him
from
receipt
of
any
public
assistance
benefits
under
the
unemployed
fathers
section.
in
addition,
adoption
of
the
district
court
option
plan
which
shifts
the
burden
of
providing
aid
to
children
of
unemployed
fathers
from
the
unemployment
compensation
insurance
trust
funds
funded
totally
from
the
private
sector
namely
the
employers
to
the
public
treasury
and
increase
the
public
assistance
roles
again
contrary
to
congress'
intent
back
in
1967.
in
effect,
what
the
district
court
option
plan
does
is
legislate
an
income
floor
for
all
unemployed
fathers,
and
that
income
floor
is
based
upon
the
state's
standard
of
need.
therefore,
any
unemployed
father
could
forego
these
unemployment
compensation
benefits
and
get
public
assistance
up
to
that
state
standard
of
need.
historically,
these
programs
have
been
treated
as
two
separate
and
distinct
programs.
unemployment
compensation
has
always
been
the
first
line
of
defense
for
a
temporarily
unemployed
work.
the
system
is
back
from
the
initial
creation
of
the
act
in
1935
and
we
think
this
is
true
today.
we
see
just
last
year,
the
federal
unemployment
act
extended
benefits
for
those
unemployed
who
exhausted
their
normal
state
benefits.
on
the
other
hand,
public
assistance
benefits
have
always
been
treated
as
a
last
resort.
you
rely
on
relief
after
you've
exhausted
everything
else
and
i
think
this
court
recognize
these
two
principles
in
the
java
case.
as
harsh
as
this
all
seems,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
who
have
received
a
substantially
less
amount
of
money
from
unemployment
compensation
and
they
have
from
public
--
would
have
from
public
assistance
had
they
been
eligible,
vermont
has
tried
to
mitigate
or
alleviate
that
that
hardship
to
some
extent
and
that
is
by
supplementing
unemployment
compensation
through
its
general
assistance
program.
now,
i
have
to
admit,
however,
that
the
supplement
is
not
necessarily
going
to
be
equal
to
the
difference
between
the
unemployment
compensation
benefit
and
the
state's
standard
of
need.
this
depends
on
a
host
of
factors,
one
being
the
individual's
income
within
the
prior
calendar
period
and
other
being
is
need.
the
state
program
is
entirely
state
funded,
it's
based
upon
an
emergency
grant
provision
and
the
individual
applicant
must
have
no
other
resources
available.
if
he
does
have
resources
available,
he
has
to
exhaust
those
other
resources.
so,
in
some
cases,
the
individual
get
nothing
from
general
assistance.
in
some
cases
they'll
get
an
amount
which
his
total
income
will
be
less
than
the
state's
standard
of
need
and
in
other
cases,
he
could
conceivably
get
a
grant
which
would
make
his
total
income
exceed
the
state's
standard
of
need
for
a
30-day
period
but
it
is
available
to
that
applicant.
mr.
david
l.
kalib
well,
there
is
initial
benefit
period
of
26
weeks;
there
is
a
13-week
extension
period
under
vermont
statute
for
a
total
of
39
weeks.
as
i
understand,
the
program
now
under
the
new
federal
unemployment
act
of
1974,
there
are
13
more
weeks
additional
benefits
that
an
individual
can
get
and
that
i
understand
is
totally
federally
funded
and
does
not
come
out
of
the
private
trust
fund.
mr.
david
l.
kalib
that's
correct.
mr.
david
l.
kalib
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan
and
the
senate
version
of
the
new
tax
bill
drive
its
amendment
does
take
on
another
13
weeks
to
that.
mr.
david
l.
kalib
the
--
mr.
david
l.
kalib
the
final
13
weeks
as
provided
for
under
the
‘74
federal
unemployment
act
is
federally
funded
and
it
does
not
come
out
of
the
employment
trust
fund.
as
i
understand
the
senate
proposal,
it
will
be
another
13
weeks
again
federally
funded
and
not
out
of
the
trust
funds.
mr.
david
l.
kalib
a
proposal
by
--
mr.
david
l.
kalib
that's
correct
as
i
understand
it.
to
summarize,
our
position
is
very
simplistic
with
a
very
complicated
program.
if
you
are
eligible
to
receive
unemployment
compensation,
traditionally,
you
have
to
go
on
exhaust
that
benefit
before
you
can
come
on
the
welfare
roles.
unemployment
has
been
treated
differently
than
any
other
available
resource
and
i
think
there's
a
specific
congressional
intent
to
treat
that
resource
differently
and
we
urge
this
court
to
regress
and
remand.
we
would
like
to
--
if
there
is
time
reserve
it
for
tomorrow,
your
honor,
in
rebuttal.
mr.
david
l.
kalib
thank
you,
your
honor.
