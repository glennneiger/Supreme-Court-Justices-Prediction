suppose
the
single
judge
claims
that
file
that
the
counsel
aren't
suppose
to
hear
the
statute
but
the
statutory
is
supposed
to
be
heard
first
and
not
just
the
single
judge
issue,
it
is
not
required
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
court.
therefore,
i'm
going
to
hear
it
and
suppose
they've
done
that
and
he
had
decided
against
you,
now
you
would
come
before
us,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
come
here
now
because
it's
not
an
issue
which
requires
to
be
heard
by
a
three-judge
--
even
if
the
three-judge
court
decides?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
they
can
provide
it
for
mr.
justice
brennan.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
any
specific
legislative
history
that
supports
your
reading
on
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
ever
been
a
time
when
the
amount
of
unemployment
compensation
approximated
the
amount
of
benefits?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
were
heard
by
a
single
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statutory
issue
could
be
heard
by
a
single
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
is
that
exactly
through
a
--
the
sort
of
--
in
federal
court
at
all
by
virtue
of
the
pending
jurisdiction
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
on
that
and
that
that's
not
--
the
court
isn't
obliged
to
undertake
that
kind
of
before
hand.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
so
that
maybe
in
the
federal
court
by
sufferance
anyway
unless
you
can
come
under
31331
which
you
don't
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we
don't
--
then
you
don't
even
get
into
this
argument.
