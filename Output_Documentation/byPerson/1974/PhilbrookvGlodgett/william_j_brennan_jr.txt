justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
was
it
likely
in
that
case
mr.
patton
that
the
--
you
got
the
highest,
maybe
as
high
as
an
afdc
benefits
program
for
the
same
family?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
fact,
they
may
have
declared
of
the
afdc
figures
on
this
column
on
page
6.
your
position
is
what
as
with
respect
so
much
of
that
how
they
lose
if
the
father
receives
unemployment
compensation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
fact
you
know
and
what's
happened
here
is
they
waived
their
own
employment
compensation.
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
word
“receives”
in
the
statute
section
2
with
respect
into
it
for
which
says
the
child's
father
receives
unemployment
compensation
means
actually
receives?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
waives
there
that
he
doesn't
actually
receive
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
--
how
does
that
make
it
appealable
here
merely
because
the
three-judge
court
is
if
it's
not
in
constitution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
believe
we
get
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
seven
pages
from
536
to
543
--
they
live
up
to
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
we
got
to
decide
in
this
case,
don't
we
whether
you're
far
from
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
the
same
applies,
doesn't
it,
for
the
state
of
vermont's
appeal
in
the
other
case.
it's
so
different
isn't
that
quite
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
43.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
i
mean
on
this
question
of
whether
there's
the
proper
direct
appeal,
i
gather
vermont
came
here
from
the
same
judgment,
didn't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
whether
that's
a
proper
appeal
here
is
same
question
in
that
case
is
missing
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
now
on
this
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
as
some
states
are
upgrading
their
unemployment
compensation
benefits
as
they
in
fact
reach
merely
with
the
afdc.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
pending
tax
for
another
13
week?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
65
weeks
or
something.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
all
you
think
fully
federally
funded.
