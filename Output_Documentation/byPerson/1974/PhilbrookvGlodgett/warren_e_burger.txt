weinberger
against
glodgett.
mr.
patton,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

e.

another
way
of
putting
the
question
and
isn't
it
that
whether
they
have
an
option
to
take
whichever
there
is
the
hire?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
key,
the
unemployment
scheme
is
for
something
for
which
they
pay
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kalib.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
this
probably
solve
by
having
the
state
provide
in
its
statute
that
no
event
shall
the
afdc
benefits
exceed
the
amount
of
unemployment
compensation
insurance
or
would
you
rather
have
other
problems
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
have
to
check
your
time
in
the
morning
but
you
will
not
take
up
your
case,
mr.
kalib.
you
will
have
only
one
minute
now,
we'll
take
you
first
thing
in
the
morning.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
arguments
in
number
73-1820,
philbrook
against
glodgett
and
the
related
case.
mr.
kohn,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
would
be
the
situations
mr.
kohn
hypothetically
if
a
man,
unemployed
receiving
unemployment
compensation
insurance
or
having
to
take
in
whichever
option
he
wanted,
then
on
reporting
is
offered
employment,
that
suitable
employment,
that
refuses
to
accept
it,
would
--
that
would
affect
his
unemployment
compensation
claim
in
such
able?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
effect
if
any
would
it
have
on
the
welfare
payment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
same
in
each
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
puts
a
hardship
on
the
family
as
the
consequence
of
the
conduct
of
the
father,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
there
are
some
difficulty
in
making
comparisons
because
the
unemployment
compensation
is
a
terminal
kind
of
payment
and
the
welfare
payment
is
open
end,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
largely
open
end?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
should
always
be
dealt
with
by
states
the
least,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
a
state
if
the
action
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
frequently
is,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
a
single
judge
does
act
and
there
is
no
direct
appeal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
kohn.
mr.
patton,
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
really
need
30
days
for
that
counsel
if
you
can
submit
it
less
than
printed
form
--
fully
printed
form.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
we'll
expect
it
in
15
days
and
if
the
counsel

if
