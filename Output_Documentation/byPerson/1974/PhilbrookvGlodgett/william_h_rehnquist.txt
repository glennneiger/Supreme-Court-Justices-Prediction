justice
william
h.
rehnquist
three-judge
district
court
didn't
decide
this
case
on
a
constitutional
basis
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
sure
that
whether
the
appeal
should
come
here
rather
than
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
certainly
had
jurisdiction
but
then
their
question
is
who
has
jurisdiction
over
the
appeal
if
it
decides
it
only
on
the
statutory
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
have
to
argue
in
response
to
justice
brennan
the
supremacy
clause
determination
is
the
constitutional
determination
for
purposes
of
our
appellate
jurisdiction?
justice
william

white
against
william?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
that
vermont
might
be
able
to
rely
on
the
supremacy
clause
as
a
constitutional
basis
but
certainly
the
federal
government
in
no
event
can
rely
on
the
supremacy
clause
if
you're
talking
about
the
construction
of
a
federal
statute.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
more
than
the
father
earned
when
he
was
working
at
$100.00
a
week?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
assuming
from
what
you
just
said,
i
would
gather
that's
true.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
sosna,
it
gives
you
remedy
for
that
in
a
class
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
we
said
in
sosna
that
if
it
wasn't
moot
as
to
the
name
plaintiff
there
is
no
problem
but
if
it's
moot
as
to
the
named
plaintiff.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
was
a
possibility
of
repetition
as
to
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
philbrook
against
and
glodgett
and
weinberger
against
glodgett
the
question
is
whether
the
receipt
of
state
unemployment
compensation
may
be
permitted
to
bar
the
receipt
of
aid
--
aid
for
dependent
children
assistance
under
the
federal
social
security
statute.
a
three-judge
district
court
in
vermont
held
that
it
could
not
be
and
that
vermont's
administration
of
its
program
so
as
to
terminate
afdc
upon
receipt
of
--
or
eligibility
for
unemployment
compensation
violated
the
applicable
federal
statute.
both
state
and
federal
administrators
appealed
to
this
court.
we
conclude
that
the
three-judge
district
court
was
correct
in
its
construing
of
the
federal
statue.
and
on
the
appeal
of
the
state
administrators,
we
affirm.
on
the
appeal
of
the
secretary,
we
dismiss
his
appeal.
