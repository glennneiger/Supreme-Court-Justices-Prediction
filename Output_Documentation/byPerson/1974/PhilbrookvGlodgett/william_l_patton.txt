mr.
william
l.
patton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
in
the
district
of
vermont.
the
cases
involved
the
relationship
between
the
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
or
afdc,
unemployed
father
program
and
unemployment
compensation
benefits.
the
principal
statute
involved
is
section
607(c)(2)(ii)
which
i
shall
refer
to
an
argument
as
the
mandatory
bar
and
that
provision
appears
on
page
3
of
our
brief.
as
this
court
knows,
the
afdc
program
is
a
program
of
cooperative
federalism
funded
by
the
system
of
matching
state
and
federal
grants.
the
federal
statute
sets
out
certain
conditions
that
state
plans
must
satisfy
in
order
to
receive
federal
funding
and
the
mandatory
bar
provision
provides
that
state
plans
must
provide
for
the
denial
of
afdc
benefits
with
respect
to
any
week
for
which
such
child's
father
receives
unemployment
compensation
under
an
unemployment
compensation
law
of
a
state
or
the
united
states.
now,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
were
all
families
which
were
eligible
for
afdc
benefits
but
for
the
fact
that
in
each
case
the
unemployed
receive
unemployment
compensation
under
state
law
and
in
each
case,
the
amount
of
unemployment
compensation
received
was
considerably
less
than
the
afdc
benefits
for
which
the
family
would
have
been
eligible.
mr.
william
l.
patton
mr.
justice
blackmun,
it
does
not
show
the
status
of
things.
as
of
this
moment,
we
do
know
that
mr.
saracen
who
was
an
intervenor
continues
to
be
unemployed
and
continues
to
receive
unemployment
compensation.
at
the
bottom
of
page
6
of
our
brief,
there
is
table
which
shows
the
differences
in
benefit
levels
and
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
is
one
error
in
that
table.
the
derosia
family
was
eligible
for
$394.00
a
month
in
afdc
and
rather
than
$56.00
in
unemployment
compensation,
that
figure
should
be
$224.00.
mr.
william
l.
patton
page
6
of
our
brief.
there
is
a
table
at
the
bottom
which
shows
the
difference
in
benefits.
mr.
william
l.
patton
the
--
instead
of
$56.00
in
the
right
hand
column,
that
should
be
$224.00
mr.
william
l.
patton
yes
sir.
now,
we
can't
assume
that
this
table
is
necessarily
representative
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
of
course,
afdc
benefits
depend
on
a
number
of
variables,
the
extent
of
other
resources
available
to
the
family
and
primarily
on
a
number
of
dependents.
unemployment
compensation
is
generally
50%
of
the
previous
salary.
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
does
not.
well,
there
maybe
some
relations
mr.
justice
stewart
and
that
some
state
unemployment
programs
have
higher
maximums
depending
on
the
number
of
dependents
but
to
that
only
to
that
limited
extent.
mr.
william
l.
patton
certainly,
in
the
case
of
low-income
people,
it
is
not
likely.
however,
there
is
one
additional
factor
and
that
is
that
vermont
like
most
states
has
a
general
assistance
program
and
the
record
does
not
show
the
extended
benefits
that
were
received
in
this
case
but
we
do
know
that
at
least
the
percy
family
received
general
assistance.
as
i
understand
the
vermont
general
assistance
program,
it
is
basically
an
item
by
item
need
program.
if
a
family
finds
that
it
can't
pay
its
rent
for
example,
it
can
apply
for
general
assistance
for
the
amount
of
the
rent.
but
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
in
vermont,
i
believe
it's
administered
on
a
statewide
basis
but
in
many
states,
it
is
administered
through
counties.
mr.
william
l.
patton
and
it's
wholly
state-funded.
mr.
william
l.
patton
they
lose
all
of
it
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that?
mr.
william
l.
patton
yes
sir,
that's
the
statutory
question.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that's
correct.
then
the
district
court
--
originally
the
statute
was
challenged
on
constitutional
grounds.
the
district
court
decided
it
could
avoid
the
question
by
holding
that
fathers
have
an
option.
they
can
turn
down
an
employment
compensation.
now,
mr.
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
yes,
sir.
we
believe
that
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
private
employers
make
contributions
to
the
unemployment
compensation
scheme.
i'm
not
sure
--
i
believe
that
employees
do
make
a
contribution.
the
district
court's
construction,
we
believe
is
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
and
structure
of
the
act
in
administrative
construction
and
those
sources
will
be
discussed
in
more
detail
by
mr.
caleb
for
the
state
of
vermont
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i'm
not
sure
--
we
do
know
that
in
1960
--
let
me
--
perhaps
if
i
just
went
into
briefly
the
history
of
the
unemployed
father
program,
we
can
see
how
this
provision
came
into
the
law.
up
until
1961,
afdc
did
not
extend
to
families
with
an
unemployed
father
and
in
that
year
it
was
so
extended
on
an
experimental
basis.
now,
at
that
time,
the
law
provided
that
states
had
an
option.
they
could
deny
afdc
if
the
father
received
unemployment
compensation
or
not.
some
states
did
deny,
i
think
only
three,
the
other
states
supplemented.
now,
in
67,
68,
when
the
unemployed
father
program
was
made
permanent,
the
senate
wanted
to
continue
that
optional
system
but
the
house
bill
provided
for
the
mandatory
bar.
the
difficulty
with
giving
fathers
an
option
is
really
threefold.
first
of
all,
it
makes
the
mandatory
bar
a
nullity.
there's
simply
be
no
reason
to
have
a
provision
requiring
a
termination
if
it
could
be
circumvented
by
an
option.
and
secondly,
it
operates
on
an
assumption
that
congress
wanted
to
encourage
the
unemployed
to
turn
down
unemployment
benefits.
and
finally,
in
operation,
it
shifts
significant
costs
from
the
unemployment
compensation
program
that
is
funded
by
private
employers
to
afdc
which
is
of
course
funded
by
state
of
internal
revenues.
mr.
william
l.
patton
yes
sir.
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
did
not.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
it
did
enter
an
injunction
that
it
be
construed
the
statute
and
then
ordered
the
secretary
of
hew
to
approve
the
plan
in
accordance
with
its
decision.
perhaps
i've
--
as
i
read
hagans
against
lavine,
a
three-judge
court
was
convened
here
because
of
the
constitutional
challenge
and
we
don't
think
it
can
be
said
that
the
constitutional
claim
was
fictitious
or
frivolous
on
the
phase
of
the
complaint
and
having
jurisdiction,
it
could
then
consider
the
statutory
claim.
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
believe
you
would
have.
mr.
william
l.
patton
but
i
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
is
not
an
issue
that's
require
to
be
hear
by
the
three-judge
court
but
the
three-judge
court
can
hear
it
if
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
it
may
have
been
rejected
but
then
in
hagans
against
lavine,
i
thought
that
it
was
again
reconsidered
though
not
adopted.
at
least
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
no
no,
i
don't
suggest
hagans
against
lavine
resolves
the
question.
mr.
william
l.
patton
you
do,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
if
it
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
there
is
a
jurisdictional
question
with
respect
to
the
united
states
which
is
quite
a
bit
different
from
the
one
with
respect
to
the
state.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
patton
they
did.
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
would
be
the
same
question.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that's
correct.
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
conflict
of
the
supremacy
issue.
now,
assuming
that
--
we
assume
that
there
is
jurisdiction
for
the
appeal
and
frankly
it's
something
that
if
the
court
is
concerned
that
we'd
like
a
permission
to
submit
a
supplemental
brief
on
and
i
think
our
opponent
would
concur
in
that.
mr.
william
l.
patton
on
this,
in
the
issue
of
the
appealability
of
the
order.
now,
assuming
that
for
the
moment
that
the
case
is
properly
here
and
assuming
that
the
court
agrees
with
our
construction
of
the
statute,
and
then
as
a
further
question
concerning
the
constitutional
challenge,
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
but
that
the
court
can
reach
the
constitutional
question
in
this
case
if
it
wishes
to
but
it
need
not
and
we
have
suggested
that
it'd
be
remanded
and
one
of
the
reasons
we
suggested
that
it'd
be
remanded
is
because
the
afdc
program
is
so
complex
that
we
had
thought
the
court
might
benefit
from
the
district
court's
decision
of
the
issue
in
light
of
a
correct
construction
of
the
statute
and
it's
also
true
that
the
record
could
be
supplemented
particularly
concerning
a
general
assistance
benefit
but
we
do
not
contend
that
it's
absolutely
necessary
to
remand.
there
is
sufficient
material
in
the
record
to
consider
the
constitutional
question.
and
as
to
the
constitutional
claim,
appellees'
claim
is
basically
that
the
mandatory
bar
operates
to
exclude
children
solely
on
the
ground
that
their
father
receives
unemployment
compensation
even
though
they
maybe
in
need.
and
it
does
operate
that
way
but
implicit
in
appellees'
claim
is
the
assumption
that
the
afdc
program
is
in
fact
the
comprehensive
public
assistance
program
or
that
it
is
constitutionally
required
to
be
and
we
think
either
assumption
is
correct.
need
is
--
the
primary
goal
of
the
afdc
program
but
congress
is
operating
within
a
framework
of
the
limited
amount
of
funds
and
given
that
context,
it
has
chosen
to
provide
assistance
to
those
who
are
least
able
to
change
their
circumstances.
and
father's
unemployment
compensation
maybe
less
than
afdc
benefits
but
it
maybe
supplemented
by
general
assistance.
states
maybe
stimulated
to
upgrade
their
programs
and
there's
some
indication
that
that
has
in
fact
occurred.
in
addition,
the
unemployment
compensation
benefits
promote
in
attachment
to
the
workforce,
it's
a
weekly
benefit.
vermont
recipients
are
required
to
go
down
to
the
public
employment
office
to
get
their
checks
and
fill
out
certain
forms.
mr.
william
l.
patton
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'm
not
prepared
to
guarantee
that
that
occurs.
they
are
upgrading
them.
i
know
for
example
and
i
understand
that
when
this
case
started
in
vermont,
the
maximum
benefit
was
50%
of
the
previous
salary,
it's
now
60%
of
the
previous
salary.
in
conjunction
with
minimum
wage
laws,
there
is
some
upward
movement
but
i
think
it
is
true
that
people
in
the
low
income
groups
are
going
to
have
lower
benefits.
now,
since
this
is
a
divided
argument,
i've
used
up
my
time.
i
want
to
stop
but
i
want
to
reiterate
one
point
that
we
made
in
our
reply
brief.
we
don't
contend
that
the
mandatory
bar
is
the
wisest
or
the
most
socially
desirable
policy
that
could
be
devised
but
we
do
contend
that
it
is
the
policy
that
congress
adopted
and
that
rejection
on
constitutional
grounds
would
involve
the
court
in
factors
which
it
is
repeatedly
rejected
and
is
inappropriate
for
judicial
resolution.
mr.
william
l.
patton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
and
the
only
point
i
want
to
respond
to
is
the
question
of
whether
the
appeal
lies
to
this
court
of
the
court
of
appeals.
at
the
time
we
filed
the
jurisdictional
statement,
we
relied
on
statement
in
hagans
agains
lavine
which
properly
characterizes
dictum
but
which
we
believe
the
reflected
the
laws
as
it
then
stood.
if
the
court
and
i
think
it's
obvious
does
wish
to
reconsider
those
cases,
we'd
like
permission
to
file
a
supplemental
brief
and
we
request
30
days
in
which
to
file
it
because
it
presents
a
number
of
questions
of
their
important
to
governments
litigating
policy
that
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
answer
it
this
time.
mr.
william
l.
patton
i'm
not
sure
mr.
justice
stewart
because
there's
--
actually
as
a
practical
matter;
we
would
have
preferred
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
because
we
think
we
could've
resolved
the
statutory
problem
there.
and
as
the
general
matter,
the
government
doesn't
have
a
preference
as
to
which
court
to
go
to
as
long
as
it
knows
where
it's
going
to
go.
but
we
do
think
there
are
some
things
that
we
are
to
consider
for
one
thing
the
rule
to
be
the
same
as
to
state
and
federal
defendants.
otherwise,
we'll
end
up
in
a
situation
where
when
joined
in
the
same
action
the
state
defendant
go
to
this
court
and
federal
defendants
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
questions
about
expedited
review
where
an
injunction
is
been
granted
and
those
are
the
kinds
of
things
we'd
like
to
consider
and
submit
in
our
supplemental.
mr.
william
l.
patton
i
wouldn't
think
so
mr.
chief
justice.
we
want
to
confer
with
the
states
and
we
also
want
to
talk
to
some
federal
agencies
to
get
their
view
on
the
question.
i
would
think
--
i
think
15
days
would
be
sufficient
if
we
can
dispense
for
printing.
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
came
as
a
surprise
to
me
yesterday
afternoon
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
we
had
anticipated
that
jurisdiction
was
postponed
on
dependent
parties
doctrine
and
we
didn't
think
that
this
question
was
for
shattered
in
gonzales
though
we
now
recognized
the
issue
and
we
respond
to
it.
mr.
william
l.
patton
yes
sir
and
--
