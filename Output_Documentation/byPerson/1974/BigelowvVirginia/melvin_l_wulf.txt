mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
virginia
supreme
court
following
a
remand
from
this
court
after
the
decisions
here
in
doe
v.
bolton
and
roe
v.
wade.
the
question,
the
principal
issue
that
the
court
has
to
decide
in
broad
terms
is
whether
the
first
amendment
which
extends
a
special
and
explicit
protection
to
the
press
allows
a
newspaper
editor
to
be
held
criminally
responsible
for
publishing
in
his
newspaper
an
advertisement
for
lawful
abortion
services.
the
facts
are
straightforward
and
were
submitted
by
agreement
on
stipulation.
the
appellant,
mr.
bigelow
is
--
was
the
director
and
managing
editor
and
responsible
officer
of
a
newspaper
called
the
virginia
weekly.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
make
any
difference
at
all
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
these
were
not
directly
professional
services
that
were
being
regulated
in
any
case,
these
were
referral
services.
this
was
not
an
advertisement
by
the
physician
that
was
performing
the
abortion.
this
was
an
advertisement
by
an
independent
institution
organization
which
referred
patients
who
came
to
them
for
the
medical
services.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
surely
is.
no,
i
don't
say
at
all
that
the
state
cannot
regulate
profession
conduct.
i
say
--
that
was
your
question.
i
say
that
this
was
not
that,
one;
two
that
it
can't
do
it
in
this
case
because
they
can't
act
against
the
press
in
this
situation;
and
three,
they
can't
do
it
in
this
case
because
the
service
was
that
was
to
be
performed
as
outside
the
territorial
power
of
the
state,
because
the
advertisement
was
for
and
the
service
to
be
performed
in
new
york
where
virginia
has
no
power
over
medical
services,
and
it
was
lawful
in
new
york.
as
i
say,
the
facts
consisted
in
this
case
of
the
advertisement,
which
on
page
4
of
our
brief,
which
announces
that
abortions
are
legal
in
new
york,
that
there
are
no
residency
requirements
there,
that
the
agency
will
provide
placement
service
“at
low
cost”,
and
provides
new
york
address
and
two
new
york
phone
numbers
where
the
services
can
--
where
the
information
about
the
services
can
be
provided.
defendant,
the
appellant
went
to
trial
on
those
facts
and
was
convicted
under
section
18.21-63
of
the
code
of
virginia
which
is
also
on
pages
4
and
5
of
our
brief,
which
states
that
“if
any
person,
by
publication,
lecture,
advertisement,
or
by
the
sale
or
circulation
of
any
publication,
or
in
any
other
manner,
encourage
or
prompt
the
procuring
of
abortion
or
miscarriage,
he
shall
be
guilty
of
misdemeanor”
was
convicted
fined
$500.00,
$350.00
and
that
was
suspended
on
a
condition
that
he'd
not
violate
the
statute
again.
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
its
decision
held
that
the
ad
satisfied
the
terms
of
the
statute,
because
it
amounted
to
the
encouraging
or
prompting
of
the
procurement
of
an
abortion
and
that
it
was
not
merely
informational,
then
went
on
to
say
that
in
petition
it
was
a
commercial
advertisement
offering
services
for
fee
relying
on
valentine
v.
chrestensen
and
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
on
hunter
versus
united
states
very
generally.
and
went
further
and
in
particular
siad
that
where
the
regulation
of
medical
health
practices
are
concerned,
the
public
should
be
free
of
commercial
practices
and
pressures.
and
also
finally
held
that
appellant
had
no
standing
through
his
--
the
overbreadth
argument
because
appellant's
conduct
was
in
the
commercial
zone.
i
shall
address
myself
to
the
first
two
issues
my
co-counsel
mr.
lowe
will
address
the
overbreadth
argument
on
his
portion
of
this
argument.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
yes.
i
don't
think
that
cigarette
advertisers
are
immune
from
prohibitions
on
advertising;
i
think
newspapers
are
immune
from
such
regulation.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think,
i
think
that's
lawful
too
because
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
any
different
than
the
facts
in
the
case
here,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
disagree
with
it
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
what
i
do
with
pittsburgh
press
is
to
try
to
persuade
at
least
one
of
the
members
of
that
majority
but
this
is
not
commercial
speech
that's
involved
in
my
case,
and
i
will
deal
with
that
because
i
think
it's
pretty
clearly
not.
before
getting
to
the
commercial
speech,
question
though,
this
statute
--
the
first
argument
is
that
the
statute
has
to
be
struck
down
on
its
face
and
as
construed
in
this
case
by
the
virginia
supreme
court,
because
it,
it
does
not
bend
any
of
those
categories
of
speech
which
this
court
has
held
are
prohibitable
nor
does
it
require
the
--
nor
in
this
case
was
there
any
clear
and
present
danger
that
any
evil
which
the
state
might
prohibit
would
in
fact
be
met.
we
also
argue
that
as
far
as
the
virginia
supreme
court's
medical
health
interests,
asserted
interests
goes
that
insofar
as
that
invites
the
application
of
balancing
test
here,
that
in
the
balance,
the
appellant
must
prevail,
and
we
also
argue
that
the
statute
is
overbroad.
but
arching
over
all
of
those
arguments
which
i
make
is
the
fact
that
the
appellant
here
was
a
newspaper
editor
convicted
solely
because
of
a
--
words
printed
in
his
publication,
his
newspaper.
and
the
specific
protection
extended
to
the
press
by
the
first
amendment
and
the
construction
application
of
the
free
press
provision
by
this
court
at
least
since
grosjean
and
on
through
mills,
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
pentagon
papers
case,
tornillo,
requires
that
the
conviction
in
this
case
be
reversed
and
that
the
appellant
not
be
allowed
to
be
convicted
of
a
crime
merely
for
printing
material
in
his
newspaper.
and
indeed
even
pittsburgh
press
assured
us
that
the
first
amendment
protections
of
the
free
press
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
allow
the
appellant
here
to
be
convicted,
because
pittsburgh
press,
the
majority
opinion,
distinguished
between
the
material
involved
there
and
the
advertisements
--
and
advertisements
which
expressed
position
on
matters
of
social
policy
and
also
distinguished
between
the
situation
regarding
the
classified
ads
and
the
pittsburgh
press
case
and
the
exercise
--
distinguishing
it
from
the
exercise
of
editorial
judgmental
discretion
in
the
content
of
advertisements.
and
the
pittsburgh
press
majority
indeed
promised,
and
i
quote
“that
we
reaffirm
unequivocally
the
protection
afforded
to
editorial
judgment
and
to
the
free
expression
of
use
on
these
and
other
issues
however
controversial.”
this
speech
cannot
be
banned
because
it
does
not
fall
into
any
of
the
standard
categories
which
this
court
has
allowed
to
be
prohibited
namely
obscene.
it's
not
obscene,
it's
not
libelous
nor
does
the
advertisement
constitute
fighting
words.
nor
does
it
present
assuming
that
the
state
may
prohibit
this
prohibit
abortions.
this
statute
does
not
require
that
advertisements
for
abortions
satisfy
the
clear
and
present
danger
test.
in
effect,
it's
clear
that
the
mere
advertisement
allows
ample
time
and
in
mr.
justice
brandeis'
words
for
a
full
discussion
of
the
question
whether
the
woman
citizen
of
virginia
will
in
fact
undergo
the
abortion.
but
that
rests
--
but
that
argue
--
even
that
argument
rests
on
the
duties
assumption
that
the
state
of
virginia
has
any
power
at
all
to
prohibit
virginia
residents
from
being
informed
of
the
availability
of
lawful
abortions
outside
the
state.
there
is
a
district
court
--
three-judge
district
court
case
in
georgia,
the
atlanta
cooperative
news
case
cited
on
our
brief
which
the
facts
struck
down
what
is
the
federal
equivalent
of
the
virginia
statute
in
1972
are
precisely
on
the
grounds
which
i
advance
here
in
our
argument.
and
another
district
court
case
in
michigan
that
supports
the
application
of
the
clear
and
present
danger
test
to
abortion
advertisements,
in
that
case
it
was
a
ban
on
billboard
advertisements
of
lawful
abortions,
abortions
lawful
in
new
york.
as
far
as
the
regulations
of
the
medical
health
field
interest
of
the
state
is
concerned
it
has
no
merit.
the
virginia
supreme
court
put
forward
the
reason
describing
its
interest
in
terms
of
assuring
the
pregnant
citizens
of
virginia
received
proper
medical
care.
but
that,
in
this
case,
although
generally
of
course,
a
fair
interest
of
the
state
where
medical
care
is
concerned,
doesn't
apply
here.
first,
the
first
amendment
is
involved
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
appellant
who
was
an
editor
of
a
newspaper,
and
for
the
reasons
i
have
already
briefly
canvassed
that
is
one
of
the
other
ingredients
that
has
to
go
onto
the
balance
here.
there
is
the
correlative
first
amendment
right
of
readers
of
the
newspapers
to
receive
the
information
about
the
availability
of
lawful
abortions
in
new
york
honest
and
on
a
subject
which
concerns
the
right
that
held
by
this
court
to
be
fundamental
to
choose
whether
the
right
that
women
have
to
choose
whether
or
not
to
bear
a
child.
there
is
an
addition
in
the
balance
the
constitutionally
protected
right
to
travel
across
state
borders.
there
is
the
constitutionally
protected
right
to
privacy
which
i
have
alluded
to.
and
there
is
finally,
the
absence
of
power
in
the
state
of
virginia
at
all
to
regulate
the
contrary
in
any
state
--
the
absence
of
power
in
any
state
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
its
citizens
out
of
state
in
ways
that
have
no
contact
with
virginia
at
all
except
the
fortuitous
fact
of
residency.
and
i
think
in
fact
that
the
last
reason
is
virtually
dispositive
of
this
case,
because
it
seems
to
me
unarguable
that
the
states
cannot
forbid
its
citizens
from
engaging
in
acts
which
are
lawful
outside
the
state,
and
if
it
cannot
forbid
that
then
it
cannot
forbid
it
advertising
of
those
activities.
didn't
i
correctly
understand
you
to
concede
that
the
state
of
virginia
or
any
state
could
forbid
members
of
the
medical
profession
from
advertising
to
perform
any
kind
of
services
including
abortion,
specifically
in
abortion?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
no,
i
didn't
concede
that
your
honor.
i
concede
that
there's
great
power
in
state
to
regulate
delivery
of
medical
services.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
said
more
generally
that
producers
of
good
--
i
think
what
i
said
was
the
produce
--
at
least
what
i
intended
to
say
was
producers
of
goods
and
services
could
be
prohibited
from
advertising
in
some
cases,
which
i
don't
have
to
define
that
there
is
a
difference
between
prohibiting
them
from
advertising
and
prohibiting
and
penalizing
newspapers
for
running
the
advertisement.
so,
i
did
not
concede
that
physicians
could
be
prohibited
from
advertising
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes.
no,
i
say,
in
general,
i
agree
with
the
minority's
view
in
pittsburgh
press
about
how
to
deal
with
that
problem,
prohibit
the
advertiser
and
not
the
newspaper.
your
question
was
specifically
whether
the
states
could
totally
ban
physicians
from
advertising
their
services.
the
court's
never
decided;
it's
come
close
to
it
perhaps
in
the
head
case
although
that
there
were
no
first
amendment
issues
raised
there.
i
suppose
i'm
affected
by
our
culture
in
thinking
perhaps
that
states
can
prohibit
physicians
from
doing
it
because
they
do,
but
i
don't
know
that
there's
ever
been
a
serious
first
amendment
objection
to
that
to
present
to
this
court
or
any
other
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
beg
your
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
surely
i
think
the
pressure
is
a
thread
of
being
disbarred
on
--
yes,
and
not
on
the
newspaper
because
the
doctor,
i
think
in
practical
terms
doctors
--
i
don't
recall
ever
seeing
an
advertisement
by
a
physician
for
standard
medical
services.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i'm
sorry?
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
there
was
a
case
the
similar
case
here
of
course
upheld
the
power
to
prohibit
that
but
again
there
wasn't
any
first
amendment
issue
raised
there.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
that
was
oculist
or
optometrist.
well,
that
was
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
yes,
yes.
again,
no
first
amendment
claim
raised
there.
there
is
of
course
the
related
interesting
case
and
cited
not
on
our
brief
but
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
curiae
the
virginia
consumer
council
case,
brought
by
consumers
rather
than
pharmacists
attacking
a
prohibition
against
pharmacists
advertising
prices
of
prescription
drugs.
and
i
would
think
that
perhaps
the
same
constitutional
approach
might
successfully
be
taken
with
respect
to
advertising
by
physicians,
where
it's
a
consumer
issue.
indeed
as
to
advertising
by
attorneys
as
well.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
think
that
could
be
prohibited
indeed.
i
think
--
i
don't
know
that
that
speech
i
think
that's
probably
criminal
solicitation
assuming
that
a
particular
narcotic
was
forbidden
validly
by
the
statutes
of
virginia
or
whatever
state.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
because
i
think
that
we
must
look
not
only
at
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
service
or
goods
is
prohibited
but
we
also
have
to
look
at
the
nature
of
the
service
or
the
goods.
and
i
think
that
whereas
an
abortion
there
was
even
then
a
very
--
it
was
then
a
very
controversial
issue,
there
was
a
very
substantial
constitutional
argument
to
be
made
out
and
behalf
of
the
right
of
women
to
have
abortions
which
was
of
course
the
ultimate
result
in
this
court,
and
that
there
were
the
very
substantial
privacy
claims
on
behalf
of
abortions
that
it
would
be
a
different
case
then
the
prohibition
against
advertisements
for
narcotics
or
for
an
assassin
for
example,
things
of
that
sort,
where
there
was
not
the
countervailing
claims
available
on
behalf
of
the
consumer
of
the
particular
ban
products.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
wouldn't
your
honor
where
--
no,
i
don't
think
i
said
that,
if
i
did
i
didn't
intend
to.
what
i
was
saying
was
that
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
i
might
make
it
but
i
don't
have
the
additional
argument
that
it
could
be
prohibited
because
it
was
solicitation
of
criminal
offense,
but
i
don't.
you
asked
me
whether
i
would
argue
that,
if
there
was
an
advertisement
for
assassin
in
a
newspaper
whether
the
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
i
might
make
it
but
i
wouldn't
make
it
very
confidently
although
i
might
argue
that
you
couldn't
proceed
against
the
newspaper
that
you
have
to
proceed
against
the
advertiser.
i
might
make
that
argument
in
that
case
also.
on
the
question
--
mr.
lowe
has
his
10
minutes
due
right
this
minute.
we
spelled
out
in
our
brief
why
the
advertisement
isn't
purely
commercial
which
is
the
words
used
in
valentine
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
examine
our
reasons
there
in
the
brief.
it
surely
is
not
a
purely
commercial
advertisement
in
the
circumstances
of
the
subject
being
advertised.
thank
you.
