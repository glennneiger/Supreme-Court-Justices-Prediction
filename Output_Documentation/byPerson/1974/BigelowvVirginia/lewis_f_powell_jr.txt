justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
wulf,
you
pointed
out
that
this
advertisement
related
to
abortions
in
new
york
where
they
were
practically
illegal,
suppose
you'd
had
an
advertisement
for
narcotics
in
virginia,
the
ad
indicating
that
if
you
got
in
touch
with
a
certain
individual,
he
could
direct
you
to
a
place
where
narcotics
could
be
obtained?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
your
answer
be
the
same
if
five
years
ago
before
this
court's
decision
on
abortions,
this
ad
had
related
to
abortions
in
virginia
where
at
that
time
they
were
illegal
except
under
certain
circumstances?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
lacy.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
the
advertisement
had
advised
readers
where
they
could
get
the
best
appendectomy
in
virginia,
is
there
any
statute
in
virginia
that
would
proscribe
that
type
of
advertisement?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
no.
let's
assume
it's
a
commercial
ad.
you
have
pointed
out
that
this
case
did
not
turn
on
whether
or
not
abortions
are
legal
or
illegal.
you
are
emphasizing,
as
i
understand
your
argument
that
virginia
has
the
right
to
proscribe
advertisements
of
medical
services
whether
they
are
legal
or
illegal?
i
was
just
wondering,
i
don't
know
whether
there
is
a
statute
in
virginia
that
would
prevent
to
somebody
advertising
what
is
a
perfectly
normal
legal
service
in
virginia.
i'm
not
talking
about
medical
ethics
at
the
moment,
i'm
talking
about
one
is
the
statute
and
if
there
is,
would
that
statute
withstand
a
first
amendment
attack?
