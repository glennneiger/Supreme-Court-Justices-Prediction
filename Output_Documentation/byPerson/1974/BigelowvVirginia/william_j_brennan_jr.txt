justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
how
far
this
goes.
suppose
this
ad,
instead
of
appearing
in
this
newspaper,
i
gather,
published
in
virginia
had
appeared
at
new
york
times,
could
this
statute
be
applied
to
distributor
of
the
new
york
times
in
the
state
of
virginia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
if
it's
enforced
or
not.
if
the
statute
reaches
the
distributor
of
the
newspaper
it
did,
could
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
i'm
wondering
how
far
you
carry
your
power
of
the
state
argument.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
reversed
and
appeared
not
in
this
paper
but
in
new
york
times.
new
york
times,
i
gather,
is
sold
in
virginia.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
it
be
distributed
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
not?
what's
the
difference
between
the
distributor
in
new
york
times
and
publisher
of
this
little
paper?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
assuming
a
statute
would
reach
those
other
than
distributor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
nothing
except
what
--
you
have
this
advertisement
in
new
york
times
instead
of
the
newspaper
distributed
in
virginia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
could?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
new
york
times
is
in
trouble
if
it
carries
its
ads
on
the
paper
of
virginia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
effectively
repeal
what
has
been
repealed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
present
statute
wouldn't
reach
this
advertisement?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
wouldn't
reach
anything
except
promoting
what
would
be
in
illegal
abortion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
your
whole
point
mr.
lacy
is
that
your
supreme
court
has
said
this
reaches
on
commercial
ads,
this
is
a
commercial
ad,
there
go
the
first
amendment
argument
fails,
is
that
it?
but
you're
right.
