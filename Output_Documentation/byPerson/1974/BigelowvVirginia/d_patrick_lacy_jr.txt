mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
18.1-63
denies
a
woman,
a
right
to
have
an
abortion
or
interferes
with
the
right
of
a
woman
to
have
an
abortion.
clearly
it
does
not.
this
is
not
an
abortion
case;
it
is
a
first
amendment
case.
it's
important
to
note
at
the
outset,
however,
that
the
appellant
does
not
contend
that
the
statute
was
passed
with
intent
to
muzzle
or
curb
the
press
or
that
the
statute
has
the
effect
of
threatening
the
financial
viability
of
the
newspaper
or
that
the
statute
in
pass
in
any
significant
way,
the
newspaper
ability
to
be
published
or
distributed
or
that
the
statute
infringes
upon
the
layout
or
organizational
decisions
of
the
newspaper,
nor
where
the
record
support
any
such
contentions.
the
appellant
was
convicted
for
running
in
his
newspaper,
a
purely
commercial
advertisement
for
a
commercial
abortion
referral
agency.
the
question
in
this
case
then
is
whether
the
state
is
barred
from
prohibiting
purely
commercial
advertisements
for
the
sale
of
medical
services.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
found
the
advertisement
to
be
purely
commercial.
this
finding
is
amply
supported
by
a
fair
reading
of
the
advertisement
itself.
as
stated
by
the
court
below,
the
advertisement
constituted
an
active
offer
to
performance
a
service.
it
clearly
does
not
have
the
attributes
nor
does
it
serve
the
vital
function
of
constitutionally
protect
of
speech.
the
court
below
correctly
recognized
the
fact
that
they
had
clearly
exceeded
in
informational
status,
while
the
appellate
would
have
this
court
extract
a
few
line
here
and
there
from
the
advertisement
and
be
blinded
to
the
remainder.
this
cannot
be
done.
the
advertisement
is
a
single
document
contained
within
four
corners.
it
appears
on
page
3
of
their
brief.
each
line,
each
statement
is
geared
to
making
the
offer
sufficiently
attractove
to
entice
would
be
purchases
of
the
service.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
underlying,
as
stated
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
and
given
into
construction
of
a
statute,
the
underlying
basis
of
the
statute
is
that
there
should
be
no
advertising,
commercial
advertising
of
medical
services.
there
should
be
no
commercial
pressure
or
practices
through
the
use
of
commercial
advertising.
the
case
as
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
was
not
decide
on
the
basis
of
whether
abortion
was
or
was
not
illegal.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
that
certainly
was
a
holding
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
they
didn't
state
on
those
words
but
they
said
this
is
a
prohibition
against
commercial
practices
and
pressures
directed
to
free
the
medical
health
field
of
commercial
issue,
and
cited
--
it
cited
semler
versus
dental
examiners
and
williamson
versus
lee
optical
company
standing
for
that
proposition.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
the
business
of
virginia
obviously
we
cannot
tell
new
york
what
its
law
should
be.
we
cannot
prosecute
a
woman
who
goes
from
virginia
to
new
york
at
that
time
to
obtain
an
abortion,
but
we
can
say
that
if
you
come
to
virginia
and
you
want
to
advertise
medical
services
in
virginia
we
have
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
but
the
advertisement
is
in
virginia,
the
actual
advertisement
of
medical
services
is
in
virginia,
although
the
medical
services
are
going
to
be
performed
in
new
york,
the
advertisement
for
those
medical
services
is
in
virginia.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
the
same
way
in
advertising
from
medical
services
that
would
be
performed
to
virginia
could
harm
a
woman.
that
is
that
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
correct
sir.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
the
statute
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
we're
not
seeking
to
prohibit
--
this
statute
is
not
a
statute
of
prohibiting
abortion,
no
sir.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
no
sir,
it
is
not.
there's
no
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
there's
no
statutory
prohibition
against
the
woman
leaving
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
no
sir,
it's
a
statute
intended
to
keep
commercial
--
purely
commercial
advertising
out
of
the
medical
health
field.
there'd
be
no
difference
between
this
statute
if
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
alka-seltzer,
i
don't
think
is
within
that
frame
of
medical
health.
it's
a
none
proscription.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
i
think
they
could
prohibit
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
i
think
they
could
prohibit
proscription
drugs
then
you
get
in
the
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
no
sir,
but
not
for
the
reasons
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
the
difference
between
that
case
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
abortion
is
a
medical
procedure.
this
court
has
so
held;
in
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton
this
court
held
that
in
abortion
is
a
medical
procedure.
it
struck
down
to
statutes
before
in
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton
precisely,
because
the
states
in
those
particular
instances,
refuse
to
recognize
the
fact
that
it
was
a
medical
procedure.
and
those
cases
extol
the
virtues
of
professionalism
in
the
abortion
decision
in
the
first
trimester.
those
cases
extol
the
virtues
of
the
physician-patient
relationship
in
the
first
trimester.
to
strike
the
statute
down
would
be
totally
inconsistent
with
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton.
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
to
promote
professionalism
to
keep,
to
make
sure
that
person
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
professionalism
--
anybody
wants
to
render
medical
services
to
individuals
in
virginia.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
we
have
the
right
to
make
sure
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
make
sure
that
anybody
who
comes
down
to
virginia
and
advertises
in
virginia.
a
doctor
from
new
york
who
came
down
--
who
would
come
down
and
advertise
and
that
goes
back.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
it's
not
a
question
of
--
you
can't
point
to
the
injury
right
there.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
absolutely
not.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
precisely
sir,
the
police
power
to
protect
the
health
and
welfare
of
its
citizens.
obviously
it
could
not
pass
a
statute
saying
that
if
you
advertise
medical
services
in
new
york,
you
can
be
convicted.
that's
not
the
case
at
all.
cases
here
that
a
virginia
doctor
who
advertises
can
be
regulated,
an
out
of
state
doctor
who
advertises
can
be
regulated,
because
the
purpose,
the
purpose
is
to
make
sure
that
the
person
who's
rendering
the
services
is
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
patient
and
not
in
financial
gain.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
am
i
to
understand
your
honor
from
the
hypothetical
that
it
would
be
no
profit,
it's
just
an
informational
bulletin.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
the
answer
to
your
first
question
or
your
second
question
first
your
honor,
i
believe
it
would
withstand
and
i
believe
the
state
has
a
valid
interest
in
seeing
that
medical
services,
medical
procedures
are
not
advertised,
in
seeing
that
doctors
don't
say,
i
perform
or
i
specialize
in
hemorrhoidectomy
or
whatever
it
may
be
called
and
my
price
is
so
and
so
or
something
this.
well,
i
think
the
state
has
a
valid
interest.
secondly,
there
is
a
statute
in
virginia
mr.
justice
powell
18.1-417.2,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly
that
addresses
itself
to
medical
referral
agencies,
those
pass
subsequent
to
this
case
even
--
well
it's
just
passed
recently.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
reaches
directly
to
advertising
question.
but
of
course
advertising
could
i
think
come
within
its
number
there.
but
to
answer
your
second
question
first
a
very
definitely
that's
the
very
point
we're
making.
it's
not
the
question
of
whether
the
services
are
legal
or
illegal.
it's
a
fact
that
the
state
of
virginia,
the
general
assembly
of
virginia
has
the
authority
to
determine
that
the
advertisement
of
medical
services,
the
advertisements
of
doctor
services.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
that
the
statute
itself
only
pertains
to
people
who
publish
it
or
who
cause
it
to
be
published.
now
whether
it
could
be
--
i
really
don't
think
it
would
be
enforced
as
to
the
newsboy
who
might
deliver
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
first
of
all
i
don't
think
it
would
apply
to
the
distributor.
did
you
ask
me
second
question
would
be
what?
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
we
certainly
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
it
is
sold
in
virginia,
yes
sir.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
one
big
factual
difference
is
that
this
person,
the
appellant
in
this
particular
case
is
a
person
who
actually
published
it.
the
distributor,
the
poor
news
boy
out
on
the
corner
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
oh!
i'm
sorry.
without
any
sign
or
anything
at
all
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
i
think
so
for
this
reason.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
so
for
this
reason.
let's
assume
that
a
doctor
works
up
a
handbill,
setting
forth
that
he
specializes
in
tonsillectomies
and
he
has
specials
on
every
wednesday
and
friday
in
a
certain
hospital,
if
you
care
to
come
by.
he
prints
them
up
and
he
gives
them
to
people,
friends
of
his
and
says,
how
about
handing
them
out?
i
think
we
could
stop
those
people
from
handing
those
things
up.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
precisely,
yes
sir.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
the
sale
circulation,
i
think
it's
the
economic
activity,
obviously
it
probably
would
in
that
particular
instance.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
no
sir,
it's
not
in
trouble
now.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
the
statute
[laughter
attempt]
--
the
statute
is
no
longer
here.
we're
talking
about
a
statute
that
it's
been
effectively
repealed
by
amendment
over
two
and
a
half
years
ago.
in
essence,
we
will
never
know
--
the
statute
was
in
the
existence
from
1877
and
this
is
a
first
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
no
sir
what
i
mean
is
that
it
was
amended
i
said
effectively
repeal
by
amendment.
what
i
mean
is
it's
been
changed
now
to
refer
to
abortions
which
are
intended
to
be
performed
in
these
states
which
are
illegal
in
the
state
and
there
are
no
illegal
abortions
in
virginia.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
excuse
me
sir,
i
didn't
--
i'm
sorry.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
that's
the
amended
version.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
precisely,
we
had
--
we
have
to
follow
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
precisely,
but
what
the
general
assembly
did
your
honor
up
to
the
appellant's
conviction
--
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
show
they
did
it
with
regard
to
this
case
or
not
it
was
done.
it's
just
a
cold,
hard
fact
that
the
statute
was
amended.
they
just
changed
the
terms
of
the
statute
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
the
best
information
i
have
is
not
only
in
modern
times
but
in
any
time.
i
think
the
statute
was
passed
in
1878,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
and
this
has
been
the
only.
i
would
also
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
when
mr.
lowe
was
up
he
called
the
court's
attention
to
an
editorial
on
abortion
which
appeared
in
the
subsequent
issue
of
this
very
paper
published
by
the
appellant,
and
for
which
the
appellant
was
never
arrested
or
convicted
or
any
sort.
the
statute
is
not
meant
to
direct
itself
to
editorials.
it's
not
meant
to
address
itself
to
informational
burdens.
it's
meant
--
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
has
construed
the
statute
to
pertain
only
to
commercial
advertising
of
these
abortion
services.
the
advertisement
does
not
express
a
position
whether
a
woman
should
bear
a
child,
nor
does
it
criticize
virginia's
abortion
laws
or
their
enforcement.
now,
the
appellant
does
contend
that
the
mere
running
of
the
advertisement
constitutes
an
implicit
editorial
opinion
on
the
subject
matter
of
the
ad.
such
a
contention
however
is
totally
lacking
the
support
in
the
record.
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
newspaper
had
a
perfectly
acknowledge
policy
of
accepting
certain
advertisements
and
rejecting
others.
to
be
sure,
the
concept
that
the
mere
running
of
an
advertisement
constitutes
in
editorial
endorsement
of
the
subject
matter
of
the
ad
would
undoubtedly
appall
the
editorial's
test
of
the
nation's
newspapers.
the
fact
that
they
ran
an
ad
in
their
newspaper
and
the
mere
running
of
that
advertisement
constituted
an
editorial
opinion
would
undoubtedly
appalled.
in
short,
the
commercial
advertising
in
this
case
is
not
stripped
of
its
commercial
character
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
by
editorial
judgment.
the
advertisement
published
by
the
appellant
does
nothing
more
than
propose
a
commercial
transaction,
and
because
it
is
pure
commercial
speech,
it
is
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment.
unlike
the
commercial
advertisement
--
excuse
me,
unlike
the
non-commercial
advertisement
in
new
york
times
versus
sullivan,
this
advertisement
did
not
express
opinion,
recite
grievances,
protest
claim
abuses,
or
seek
financial
support
on
behalf
of
any
movement.
pure
commercial
speech
is
neither
intended
to
be
nor
does
it
have
the
effect
of
contributing
to
public
debate
like
the
ad
in
question
here,
its
intent
and
effect
is
simply
to
propose
a
business
transaction.
because
we
are
dealing
with
pure
commercial
speech
unprotected
by
the
first
amendment,
we
turn
then
to
what
is
the
interest
of
the
commonwealth.
the
interest
of
the
commonwealth
as
i
related
earlier
to
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that
the
commonwealth
has
a
right,
a
valid
interest,
in
saying
that
people
who
render
these
important
services
are
not
motivated
of
pure
of
financial
gain.
they
do
not
get
into
unseemly
cut
rate
actions
that
they
are
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
patient.
if
my
reading
of
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton
is
correct,
this
court
bottom
its
decisions
on
the
professionalism,
on
the
professional
judgment
of
the
doctor
in
the
first
trimester.
this
statute
like
roe
v.
wade
and
doe
v.
bolton
vindicates
that
professional
judgment.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
found
that
this
statute
was
directed
to
commercial
advertising
and
it
was
directed
to
the
purpose
of
keeping
these
commercial
practices
and
pressures
out
of
this
field.
i
would
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
new
york
cases
cited
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
its
decisions,
cases
in
which
it
was
found
abortion
referral
agencies
for
profit
abortion
of
referral
agencies
where
during
substantial
amount
of
advertising
where
acting
as
little
men
for
doctors,
were
soliciting
for
and
splitting
fees
with
doctors.
and
most
importantly,
those
cases
disclosed
that
these
abortion
referral
agencies
had
no
follow
up
procedures
after
abortions
that
the
women
were
cast
off
after
the
service
have
been
performed.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
interpreted
the
act.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
that
could
just
easily
have
gone
in
your
honor,
but
i
submit
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
supposed
we
have
no
legislative
history
as
you
may
know
in
virginia
versus
sullivan
do
we
have
legislation
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
we
know
from
the
new
york
cases,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
cited
the
new
york
cases.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
no
sir,
but
the
thing
--
but
the
point
is
your
honor
that
we
don't
have
to
wait.
we're
not
saying
that
all
physicians
in
new
york,
wisconsin,
or
texas,
we're
not
saying
that
at
all.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
we've
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
yes
sir,
for
definitely.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
at
page
4
of
our
brief
in
the
footnote
if
your
honor
please
footnote
2
on
page
4.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
if
the
rationale
--
our
rationale
is
underlying
that
overbreadth
doctrine's
chilling
effect
on
first
amendment
rights
or
maybe
possibly
selective
enforcement
of
the
statute
--
if
the
statute
is
unenforceable
those
things
cannot
even
exist.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
but
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
precisely,
precisely.
nowhere
reach
anybody
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
precisely.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
oh!
excuse
me,
you're
precisely
correct.
there
would
be
in
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
i'm
talking
in
terms,
we
had
a
statute
in
virginia
or
have
a
statute
in
virginia
almost
identical
to
the
georgia
statute
in
doe
v.
bolton
if
that's
what
referring
to.
because
the
overbreadth
doctrine
represents
an
exception
to
the
traditional
rule
of
standing
that
people
cannot
raise
the
hypothetical
cases
of
other,
it
should
be
use
only
sparingly
and
as
last
resort,
as
i
just
mentioned
just
in,
application
of
overbreadth
doctrine
in
this
case
would
strike
down
to
statute,
which
is
unenforceable.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
appellant
has
raised
this
morning,
the
hypothetical
cases
of
a
doctor
and
a
hypothetical
cases
of
a
lecturer
and
a
hypothetical
cases
of
a
woman
and
a
husband
and
of
an
editorial
writer.
first
of
all,
we
know
that
the
appellant
in
this
case
has
written
editorials
which
have
not
been
prosecuted,
but
also
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
expressly
rejected
those
hypothetical
cases.
it
expressly
rejected
them,
and
now
the
appellants
says
its
dictum.
if
the
court
please,
when
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
says,
"we
do
not
consider
the
statute
to
encompass
those
cases."
we
read
that
to
mean
that's
precisely
what
they
mean
that
it
does
not
encompass
those
cases.
furthermore,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
has
authoritatively
construed
the
statute
to
prohibit
only
commercial
advertising.
so
therefore,
it
would
not
even
reach
a
husband
and
wife
discussing
or
a
doctor
and
patient
discussing
it.
it's
our
position
that
an
application
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine
in
this
case
would
simply
result
in
a
windfall
for
the
appellant.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
a
conviction,
yes
sir.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
for
curing
and
advertisement
about
a
medical
service
to
with
abortion,
abortion
services,
not
illegal
abortion
services.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
yes
sir.
precisely
--
it's
the
same
point
about
dental
services
and
similar
dental
examiners.
the
services
were
not
legal,
you
know
could've
been
legal
or
illegal
it
still
proscribe
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
purely
commercial.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
no
sir,
because
it
would
have
to
--
well,
it
would
have
to
be
--
you
gave
me
one
example,
i
was
to
assume
when
i
said
that
no
illegal
abortion
in
virginia
and
you're
correct
in
the
--
that
if
they
advertise
that
come
down
to
the
local
midway
--
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
yes
sir,
there
is.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
no,
but
they
could
be
subjected
to
aiding
and
abetting
and
doctors
do
publish
that.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
this
is
not
an
ad
by
a
doctor.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
well,
you
asked
me
whether
we
have
a
statute
specifically
drawn
to
doctors
and
i'm
sorry.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
yes
sir
we
do,
specifically
drawn
to
doctors.
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
could
we
prohibit
that
sir,
is
that
your
question?
mr.
d.
patrick
lacy,
jr.
it's
section
54-317,
sub-paragraph
13
and
it
says,
"any
doctor
either
directly
or
indirectly".
so,
if
it
were
proven
that
he
told
his
nurse
to
go
do
it,
that's
precisely
correct.
if
i
left
you
with
a
wrong
impression
i'm
extremely
sorry.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you
sir.
