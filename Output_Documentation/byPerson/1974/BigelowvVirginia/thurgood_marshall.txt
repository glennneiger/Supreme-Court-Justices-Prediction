isn't
it
true
that
the
pressure
here
really
put
on
the
doctor
who
does
the
advertisement
and
not
on
the
paper
who
carried
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
the
usual
pressure
on
that
doctor
not
to
use
the
newspaper
rather
the
newspaper
who
published
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
there
have
been
dental?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
have
been
dental
cases?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
business
that
it
have
--
virginia
would
have
to
new
york
medical?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they're
not
advertising
medical
services
in
virginia.
they
are
advertising
medical
services
in
new
york.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
how
is
it
going
injure
the
commonwealth
of
virginia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
talking
about
“medical
services
in
new
york
city”
or
rather
“medical
services
outside
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
you're
seeking
to
regulate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
it's
prohibited?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
prohibited
then
people
from
traveling
to
new
york
to
get
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
it
is,
it's
just
penalizing
the
newspaper
for
publishing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
you
prohibit
them
from
advertising
alka-seltzer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
aspirin?
justice
thurgood
marshall
aspirin
is
slightly
medical?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
they
prohibit
the
advertising
to
people
of
virginia
that
you
can
buy
aspirin
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
difference
between
that
and
this
case
is
just
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
professionalism
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
new
york?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
make
sure
that
new
york
does
its
medical
job
properly?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
you
had
anything
to
do
with
this,
if
this
was
--
and
advertise
would
mail
down
through
the
mail,
you
don't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
that,
because
of
interstate
commerce,
and
they
sent
it
down
and
sent
the
check
and
then
they
published
it.
and
how
did
that
injure
virginia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
pass
a
statute
to
say
that
no
woman
in
virginia
can
go
to
new
york
and
get
an
abortion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
does
that
interpret
an
act
passed
in
1872
as
to
what
new
york
is
doing
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
basis
of
what's
going
on
now
in
as
to
compared
to
1872?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
knows
one
single
thing
about
what
goes
on
in
the
matter
of
profession
in
the
state
of
new
york,
am
i
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all
you
know
but
you
don't
know
how
--
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
takes
position
that
the
medical
profession
is
--
new
york
has
long
or
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
decided
in
virginia
to
advertise
in
new
york
is
wrong.
