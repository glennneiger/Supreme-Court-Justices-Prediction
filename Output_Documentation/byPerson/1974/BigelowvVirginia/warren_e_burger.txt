chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
bigelow
against
virginia.
mr.
wulf,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
make
any
difference
mr.
wulf
to
your
decision
you
have
asserted
in
your
briefs
if
that
were
explicitly
an
ad
which
solicited,
actively
solicited
--
you
say
this
is
just
an
announcement
of
service,
but
suppose
they
solicited
and
fixed
prices
and
set
credit
terms
can
be
arranged
in
an
extensive
treatment
that
usually
associated
with
solicitation
of
business?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
at
all,
then
it
follows
the
state
has
no
power
to
regulate
the
advertising
of
professional
services?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
a
matter
--
that's
conduit
to
the
professional
services,
isn't
it,
a
direct
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
it
follows
from
your
position
mr.
wulf
that
a
state
would
be
constitutionally
prohibited
from
telling
newspapers
that
they
could
not
advertise
cigarettes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
you
said
that
they
could
forbid
the
doctrine,
they
couldn't
forbid
the
newspaper
from
taking
the
ad?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
in
the
pittsburgh
press
case
thought
that
employers
might
be
prohibited
from
specifying
certain
factors
in
employment
ads
but
the
newspapers
could
not.
i
think
there
was
some
concession
work
in
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lowe.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
newspapers
ordinarily
accept
pay
for
exercising
the
editorial
function?
are
you
suggesting
newspaper
accepts
--
will
publish
editorials
for
pay?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
an
editor
is
so
enthusiastic
about
a
particular
activity,
he
can
promote
that
in
his
editorial
columns
and
his
news
column
without
calling
on
ads,
can't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
these
newspapers
on
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
pittsburgh
is
the
one
that
you
would
center
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
it's
the
most
recent
or
the
most
definitive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lacy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
seemed
to
put
it
on
the
basis
of
virginia's
sovereign
power
to
protect
its
citizens,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
to
who
can
be
prohibited?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
do
you
think
your
statute
18.163,
as
it
existed,
went
that
far?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it
says
if
any
person
by
publication
much
your
advertisement
or
by
the
sale
or
circulation
of
any
publication,
wouldn't
that
cover
mr.
justice
brennan's
hypothetical?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
that
would
be
procedures
by
other
than
licensed
physician?
is
that
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
your
last
statement
that
was
limited
to
abortions
that
were
illegal
in
virginia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
simply
means
that
it's
the
one
that's
performed
by
someone
other
than
a
physician
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
advertising
of
medical
services
as
i
think
mr.
justice
powell
pointed
out.
i
think
the
offense
agreed
to
without
and
by
implication.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
a
case
involving
advertising
not
the
whole
of
the
conduct.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
tell
us
that
this
was
the
first
prosecution
under
the
statute
in
modern
times?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
doctor
had
his
nurse,
his
receptionist
put
the
ad
in
the
paper,
just
simply
giving
out
a
name
such
as
this
one
reliable
medical
referral
service?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
present
statute
of
virginia
prohibit
that?
i'm
not
talking
about
this
new
statute
on
advertising.
you
said
virginia
has
a
statute
prohibiting
doctors
from
advertising
medical
services.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
73-1309,
bigelow
against
virginia
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
blackmun.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
blackmun.
