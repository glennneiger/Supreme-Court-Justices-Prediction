justice

r.

i
thought
you
would
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
think
you
would
not
say
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
assassins
mentions
for
hire
--
assassins
for
hire?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
--
what
about
the
law,
doctors
may
not
advertise
the
newspapers
may
not
carry
their
ads?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that
is
narrow?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
don't
have
to
ask
for
their
medical
services.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
make
it
as
narrow
as
you
can
possibly
imagine
and
so
that
you
have
to
get
down
on
the
substitute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
not
talk
about
overbreadth.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
the
press
be
permitted
to
carry
the
ad
of
a
person
who
is
forbidden
to
publish
an
ad?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wasn't
there
some
flavor
of
this
in
the
virginia
court's
opinion
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
doctors
shouldn't
advertise;
the
newspaper
shouldn't
carry
their
ads?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
--
did
you
find
any
evidence
that
the
statute
was
based
on
anything
other
than
an
assumption
that
a
newspaper
shouldn't
advertise
or
services
that
were
illegal?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
the
--
just
a
specialize
application
of
the
general
prohibition
against
advertising
by
doctors?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
from
putting
the
ad
into
a
newspaper,
advertisement?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
do
you
--
mr.
lacy,
do
you
have
a
--
is
there
before
us
in
the
brief
story
where
the
new
statute
in
virginia
--
the
text
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
is
the
effective
statute.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
if
there
was
any
overbreadth
problem,
it's
cured
by
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
saying
that
the
present
statute
merely
prohibits
advertisings
about
illegal
abortions.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
are
still
illegal
abortions.
i
feel
by
people
that
were
(voice
overlap).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
order
there
are
still
some
abortions
that
are
illegal?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
think
if
the
overbreadth
--
let's
assume
the
overbreadth
argument
is
draw
practical
purposes
out
of
the
case,
what
do
you
think
the
issue
is
with
respect
to
--
that's
left
in
this
case.
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
conviction?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
doing
what,
for
preparing
an
advertisement
about
an
abortion
or
an
illegal
abortion
or
a
legal
abortion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
your
view,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
legal
or
illegal?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
maybe
right
about
the
old
statute
but
that's
a
conduct
for
which
this
defendant
was
convicted
wouldn't
violate
this
new
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
there
some
general
statute
that
prevents
doctors
from
advertising
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
general
statute
that
says
newspapers
can't
publish
doctors
ads
for
their
services?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
why
did
you
tell
me
carrying
an
ad
--
carrying
that
this
--
the
ad
that's
involved
in
this
case
wouldn't
be
illegal
in
virginia?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
an
ad
about
a
medical
service,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
