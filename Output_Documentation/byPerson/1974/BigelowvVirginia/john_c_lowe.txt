mr.
john
c.
lowe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
wulf
has
addressed
the
question
of
the
first
amendment
protections
involved
here
and
i
will
speak
to
the
issue
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine
relating
to
first
amendment
issues
on
this
advertisement
that
was
placed
here.
first,
we
certainly
contend
that
this
advertisement
was
not
pure
commercial
advertising,
and
i
will
address
that
specifically
in
a
moment.
we
believe
that
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
record
of
editorial
position
being
taken
within
the
advertisement
and
that
this
is
a
part
of
the
editorial
position
of
this
paper.
the
overbreadth
question
of
course
--
mr.
john
c.
lowe
your
honor,
i
am
most
certainly
suggesting
that
in
the
context
particularly
of
an
underground
newspaper
where
it's
a
hand
to
mouth
operation
where
a
dollar
here
and
there
helps
to
keep
the
paper
going
that
they
do
accept
fund
from
whatever
source
including
accepting
advertisement
which
follows
their
editorial
policy
and
supports
it,
but
which
will
provide
some
revenues,
and
in
fact
this
is
the
case
here.
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
points
that
has
been
raised
is
that
this
was
a
paid
advertisement
for
a
commercial
profit
organization.
now,
the
fact
that
it
was
paid
has
been
disposed
off
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan.
that
clearly
does
not
remove
the
first
amendment
protection.
the
fact
that
it
was
allegedly
a
profit-making
organization
is
only
in
the
record
because
of
the
may-june
issue
of
the
virginia
weekly
which
is
in
the
record
in
kind
relating
to
an
acknowledgement
by
the
weekly
staff
on
page
5
where
it
states,
“the
weekly
collective
has
since
learned
that
this
abortion
agency,
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
commercial
groups
aren't
charging
women
for
a
fee
for
a
service
which
is
done
free
by
women's
liberation,
planned
parenthood.”
in
other
words,
this
--
and
this
was
submitted
by
the
commonwealth
and
yet
does
support
factually
the
contention
that
at
the
time
this
ad
was
inserted,
at
the
time
the
offense
took
place,
the
staff
of
this
newspaper
thought
that
they
were
simply
one
more
group
of
the
radical
left
wing
or
whoever
it
is,
it
is
urging
the
editorial
policy
of
this
newspaper
which
was
supporting
it
and
was
doing
a
free
service
to
people
that
they
genuinely
felt
needed
abortion
counseling.
only
later
they
find
that
these
abortion
advertisement
services,
women's
pavilion,
was
actually
making
money
on
it,
and
to
their
great
chagrin
they
announced
it
here
with
some
anger.
i
think
that
points
out
graphically
that
this
was
not
a
commercial
advertisement
in
the
sense
that
they
knew
this
was
a
profit
making
venture,
but
rather
was
a
part
and
extension
of
editorial
policy.
mr.
john
c.
lowe
he
can
and
he
does.
in
fact,
in
the
may-june
issue,
there
is
editorial
writing
and
i
might
point
out
mr.
chief
justice
that
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
has
stated
that
this
is
not
an
underground
newspaper
or
at
least
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
i
think
within
the
limits
of
the
english
language
in
the
minds
of
man
to
create
an
underground
newspaper,
the
may-june
1971
issue
is
such
a
newspaper
if
there
are
any
at
all.
it
has
all
the
revolutionary
rhetoric,
all
of
the
anti-establishment
epithets,
the
whole
spectrum
of
underground
newspapership,
and
in
fact
it
has,
in
many
issues,
and
i
believe
in
this
one
also,
little
boxes
of
information.
if
you
want
abortion
counseling,
contact
diane
at
a
certain
number
or
that
type
of
information.
mr.
john
c.
lowe
the
other
ones
are
not.
no,
your
honor,
and
one
of
the
reasons
and
again
i
have
to
state
that
in
the
trial
court
in
the
initial
two
trial
courts
we
have
a
two-tier
system
in
virginia
of
course.
the
issue
of
commercialism
was
never
raised
by
the
commonwealth,
never
raised
by
the
court
and
did
not
come
up
and
there
was
no
record
made
on
it
other
than
these
two
issues.
the
issue
which
is
in
whole
and
of
course
the
advertisement
itself,
but
in
fact,
the
editorial
policy
is
supported
by
advertisements
by
notices
which
you
might
call
advertisement
but
which
are
really
insertions
of
little
boxes
of
information
where
you
go
for
certain
types
of
information
if
you
want
it.
now,
in
the
context
of
the
case
of
broderick
against
oklahoma
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
this
court
discussed
the
overbreadth
doctrine,
but
in
fact,
i
think
broderick
really
related
more
to
a
changing
view
where
the
first
amendment
activity
was
conduct
rather
than
speech.
there,
of
course
the
court
stated
that
conduct
would
have
to
be
real
and
substantial
overbreadth
if
it
were
going
to
be
overruled
rather
than
in
a
pure
speech
where
a
defendant
or
an
appellant
could
assert
hypothetical
rights
of
others
in
overturning
a
statute.
now,
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
does
not
really
contest
the
idea
that
this
might
be
overbroad
if
it
is
a
first
amendment
issue,
but
merely
contests
the
standing
and
says
there
is
no
first
amendment
issue
here.
we
have
of
course
a
pure
speech
question
here.
i
don't
think
there's
much
question
that
we're
not
involved
in
conduct.
this
is
an
advertisement,
it's
a
mere
advocacy
insofar
as
it
had
editorial
content
and
we
believe
that
the,
as
i
have
mentioned
before,
the
commercialism
does
not
really
get
in
the
way
of
a
fact
that
it
is
pure
speech.
we
believe
that
the
record
itself
shows
that
there's
an
editorial
policy
which
is
supported
by
the
advertisement.
now,
in
the
context
of
broderick,
we
do
have
a
very
substantial
overbreadth
here.
the
hypothetical
situations
we
have
outlined
in
our
brief
are
very
substantial.
under
the
virginia
law,
a
doctor
could
not
advise
his
patient
to
have
an
abortion.
a
husband
could
not
urge
his
wife
to
have
an
abortion
if
they
had
an
unwanted
pregnancy.
an
editorial
in
a
newspaper
could
not
urge
abortions
to
cut
down
on
population
explosions,
speeches,
the
zero
population
group,
all
of
these
groups
would
be
illegal
if
they
so
much
as
urge
abortions.
this
was
a
very
burning
social
issue
particularly
before
the
roe
against
wade
and
doe
against
bolton
decisions,
and
it
is
still
a
very
burning
issue.
now,
the
fact
that
there
is
a
substantial
chill
on
first
amendment
activity
is
pointed
out
by
the
commonwealth
exhibit
number
3
in
the
record
which
is
a
cavalier
daily,
university
of
virginia
newspaper
of
1970
in
which
there
was
an
article
attributing
to
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
a
warning
to
the
virginia
commonwealth
university
school
newspaper
that
they
better
not
publish
any
abortion
advertisements
for
abortion
referrals.
i
think
that
clearly
when
the
attorney
general
of
virginia
issue
warnings
you
must
have
chilling
effect
on
rights.
now,
we
again
following,
the
broderick
type
of
analysis,
we
do
not
have
here
an
ordinary
criminal
law.
this
is
a
law
which
is
specifically
designed
and
aimed
at
abortion
advertisements
and
not
illegal
advertisements
in
general.
and
in
response
to
your
--
further
response
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
as
to
whether
a
state,
for
example,
could
not
prohibit
absolutely
advertisements
with
rates
listed
in
there,
i
think
that
pittsburgh
press
teaches
us
that
if
the
advertised
information
is
itself
illegal,
such
as
discriminatory
sex
hiring,
then
that
is
a
different
category
entirely
and
if
the
state,
for
example,
prohibited
physicians
from
advertising
rates
or
from
posting
rates
or
from
telling
people
rates
of
abortions,
then
i
think
clearly
they
could
then
under
pittsburgh
press
find
the
advertisement
to
be
an
illegal
one.
now,
we
disagree
with
pittsburgh
press
but
that
i
think
i
have
to
concede
if
i
can
see
that
the
court
is
talking
about
pittsburg
press.
in
addition,
i
think
the
real
danger
there
is
that
the
state
would
come
up
with
law
that
says,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
a
newspaper
to
publish
an
ad
which
is
illegal,
and
leave
it
up
to
the
press
to
worry
in
advance
of
every
advertisement
it
put
in
whether
it
might
violate
some
hiring
law
or
might
some
housing
law
or
some
professional
law
at
the
risk
of
publishing
at
all
to
where
newspaper
perhaps
would
have
to
restrict
greatly
the
type
of
ads
that
it
took.
again,
i
would
emphasize
that
abortions
were
legal
in
virginia
when
this
case
came
down,
when
charge
was
made.
true,
there
were
certain
types
of
abortions
which
were
not
legal
but
there
were
legal
abortions,
so
that
this
was
not
an
advertisement
for
an
illegal
activity
even
in
virginia,
and
following
the
fifth
circuit
case
which
this
court
denied
certiorari
to,
the
hyatt
against
united
states
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
in
hyatt
there
was
an
anti-divorce
advertising
statute,
and
the
fifth
circuit
specifically
said,
"it
would
be
one
thing
if
you
prohibited
advertisement
of
divorces
which
were
fraudulent
or
somehow
illegal."
and
in
this
context
if
this
were
a
well
drawn
statute,
narrowly
drown
to
prohibit
illegal
abortions
in
virginia,
those
which
were
illegal
under
roe
v.
wade
--
mr.
john
c.
lowe
i
think
the
first
will
mr.
justice
white
that
that
is
--
mr.
john
c.
lowe
i
think
that
would
but
i
think
that
would
be
overbroad
in
sweeping
in
much
conduct
which
would
not
be
proper
now
--
mr.
john
c.
lowe
well,
for
example
i
think
that
there
--
well,
of
course
obviously
adopted
to
advertise
for
health.
mr.
john
c.
lowe
i
would
have
to
say
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
john
c.
lowe
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
lowe
alright,
of
course
i
take
--
mr.
john
c.
lowe
i
would
have
to
first
answer
somewhat
as
mr.
(inaudible)
had
just
answered
that
i
must
answer
that
in
a
context
of
the
first
amendment
as
this
court
has
handed
down
through
decisions.
and
i
believe
that
this
court's
decisions
would
say
that
a
state
could
do
that.
i
don't
happen
to
personally
agree
with
it
but
i
believe
that
i
would
have
to
interpret
it
in
that
context
given
the
decisions
which
this
court
has
handed
down.
yes,
i
think
the
state
could
do
that
--
mr.
john
c.
lowe
i
think
i
would
center
on
pittsburgh.
mr.
john
c.
lowe
no,
i
think
it's
just
the
most
definitive
on
point
there,
and
again
i
have
not
--
we
have
dealt
in
the
terms
of
an
abortion
referral
agency
which
i
think
it's
a
little
different
than
a
professional,
a
doctor.
here,
they're
offering
information,
they're
offering
and
perhaps
they
call
it
conduit,
but
they're
offering
directions;
they're
not
offering
a
specific
service
that's
performed
on
the
patient.
mr.
john
c.
lowe
oh!
i
think
that
there
was
such
a
flavor,
yes.
mr.
john
c.
lowe
i
believe
that
that
is
the
part
of
the
basis,
yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
see
that
my
time
is
up
and
i
will
(inaudible).
