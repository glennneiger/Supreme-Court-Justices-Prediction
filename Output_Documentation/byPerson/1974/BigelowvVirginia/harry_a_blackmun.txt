what
about
the
virginia
newspaper
carrying
an
ad
for
a
maryland
lottery
assuming
the
lottery
is
illegal
in
virginia
but
legal
in
maryland?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
the
commonwealth,
virginia.
the
appellant,
mr.
bigelow
is
the
managing
editor
of
a
weekly
newspaper
published
in
charlottesville.
in
1971,
over
four
years
ago,
an
issue
of
the
newspaper,
carried
an
advertisement
by
the
women's
pavilion
in
new
york
city.
its
gist
was
that
abortions
are
now
legal
in
new
york
and
that
the
advertiser
could
make
all
arrangements
and
help
with
information
and
counseling
with
respect
to
placement
in
accredited
hospitals
and
clinics.
at
the
time
the
ad
was
carried,
abortions
were
legal
in
new
york
although
not
in
virginia
and
there
then
was
no
proscription
in
new
york
against
the
rendition
of
medical
referral
services
for
a
fee.
later,
the
latter
was
restricted
by
new
york
statute.
also
at
the
time,
the
advertisement
was
carried
in
virginia,
that
state
had
a
statute
providing
that
if
any
person
by
advertisement
or
by
the
circulation
of
any
publication
in
any
manner
encourage
the
procuring
of
abortion,
he
was
guilty
of
misdemeanor.
this
was
an
old
statute
going
back
to
1878.
apparently
however,
bigelow's
prosecution
was
the
first
under
that
statute
in
modern
times.
and
parenthetically,
we
note
that
the
statute
was
amended
in
1972
so
as
to
restrict
its
application
with
respect
to
an
abortion
to
be
performed
in
virginia.
bigelow
was
found
guilty
under
the
statute
and
was
fined.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
on
review,
affirm
the
conviction
by
a
divided
vote.
after
the
decisions
in
the
abortion
cases
in
this
court,
some
two
years
ago,
we
vacated
the
judgment
and
remanded
the
case
for
further
consideration
in
the
light
of
those
cases.
on
reconsideration,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
again
affirmed
the
conviction.
this
of
course
is
a
first
amendment
case
rather
than
a
case
concerning
abortions
as
such.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
we
hold
that
the
statute
as
applied
to
appellant,
bigelow
infringed
constitutionally
protected
speech
under
the
first
amendment.
we
further
hold
that
the
virginia
courts
erred
in
assuming
that
advertising,
as
such,
was
entitled
to
no
first
amendment
protection.
speech
is
not
entirely
stripped
the
first
amendment
protection
merely
because
it
appears
in
the
form
of
a
paid
commercial
advertisement
and
the
fact
that
the
ad
here,
reflected
the
advertiser's
commercial
interests
did
not
negate
all
first
amendment
guarantees.
viewed
in
its
entirety,
this
ad
conveyed
information
of
potential
interest
to
a
diverse
audience.
the
state
of
course,
has
an
interest
in
the
welfare
and
health
of
its
citizens.
it
may
seek
to
disseminate
information
so
as
to
enable
its
citizens
to
make
better
informed
decisions
when
they
leave
the
borders
of
the
state.
but
it
may
not,
under
the
guise
of
exercising
internal
police
powers,
bar
a
citizen
of
another
state
from
disseminating
information
about
activity
that
is
legal
in
that
other
state.
i'm
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
white.
