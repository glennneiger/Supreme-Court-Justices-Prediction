justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
then
you
think
it
--
absolutely
essential
with
that
issue
be
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
are
focusing
wholly
on
the
erosion
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
in
terms
of
the
necessity
to
decide
the
tucker
act
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
true
even
without
--
even
assuming
no
erosion?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
three-judge
court
you
are
suggesting
is
wrong
and
that
--
in
the
saying
that
wasn't
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
same
is
true
with
erosion,
with
respect
to
erosion?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
sense,
this
is
sort
of
an
--
the
absence
of
an
issue
that
is
justiceable
at
this
time
or
right
this
issue
isn't
it?
because,
you
simply
cannot
ascertain
as
of
today
whether
or
not
there
will
be
an
unconstitutional
erosion
of
whether
or
not
the
conrail
securities
will
be
adequate?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
end
up
never
thinking
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what's
the
--
what
is
the
compulsion
beside
at
them
but
when
the
property
is
taken
under
any,
then
it
is
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's,
that's
--
its
going
to
be
years,
whether
is
that
right
but
it's
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you'll
be
happy
while
you're
waiting?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
be
and
won't
be
infringed
either
if
they
get
paid
enough
for
that
designed
in
tucker
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
sure
they
wont.
i
guess
it
is
the
question
when
--
we
are
just
arguing
as
my
brother
powell
said
about
winning
something
right
the
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
will
change
for
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
the
same
sort
of
an
argument
that
we
would
use
if
you
were
asked
why
the
three-judge
court
had
any
power
at
all
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
the
special
court
apparently
thought
it
had
and
perhaps
it
does.
how
to
consider
the
same
questions
that
we
are
talking
about
now.
and
perhaps
congress
intended
that
to
be
the
exclusive
avenue
for
review
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
issue
isn't
raised
by
anyone,
case
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
classify
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cutler,
does
the
--
do
the
obligations
of
the
association
that
are
issued
to
conrail
that
maybe
--
and
maybe
issued
to
the
railroads
in
exchange
for
their
properties,
do
those
obligations
represent
loans
from
the
association
of
conrail?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
would
superior
to
any
stock
in
if
they
serve
it
that
conrail
issued
to
the
railroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
they
extend
them
as
the
associations
of
securities
are
issued,
then
that
the
stock
that
has
been
issued
is
less
valuable?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
or
without
being
assure
or
guaranteed?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
would
say
that
they
shouldn't
reach
the
tucker
act
matter
or
should
say
that
we
should
reach
it
and
say,
it
is
unavailable?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
do
anticipate
a
situation,
where
the
tucker
act
would
be
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
tucker
act
you
would
think
would
be
available
message?
justice
byron
r.
white
who's
make
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
who's
make
the
move,
mr.
horsky?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
conceivable
that
the
court
could
determine
that
there
is
no
tucker
act
remedy
and
that
nonetheless
the
statute
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
thing
that
will
be
deprived
of
is
a
liquidation
type
reorganization
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
order
to
carry
out
liquidation?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
do
not
reach
this
unless
you
find
the
railroad
isn't
reorganizable
as
a
profitable
railroad?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
first
date,
the
date
of
merger?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
various
types
for
that
pot
will
be
still
had
some
requisites
on
some
priority
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
reorganization
proceeding
isn't
going
to
be
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
special
court
when
ask
to
decide
to
the
value
of
very
pieces
that
the
various
estates
convey?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
know
that
the
--
so,
that
there's
going
to
be
some
securities
directed
in
the
direction
of
the
penn
central
estate
bound
to
which
the
you
have
a
prior
claimants?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you're
going
to
be
--
you
all
are
just
made
in
your
own
security
a
creditors.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
retained
your
position
in
the
estate,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
know
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
known
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
is
that
absolutely
certain,
no
question
whatsoever
that
sooner
or
later
there
would
be
enough
money
or
value
in
the
penn
central
estate
to
pay
you
off
at
least
but
nobody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
been
--
would
you
have
some
claim
that
wasn't
being
satisfied?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
you
have
--
what
i
mean
is
that
you
weren't
--
your
claim
doesn't
displaced
you
still
have
as
much
as
the
prior
claim
as
a
proceeds.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
had
to
the
properties.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
rail
act
may
not
say
so,
but
that's
going
to
--
that's
the
lee
ads
bankruptcy
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
come
it
was
given
--
how
come
it
was
given
the
new
haven
estate
to
gain
profit.
you're
going
to
have
appropriate
claims
in
it
and
assuming
that
there
is
enough
money
in
there.
you
may
at
least
use
or
at
least
to
a
--
i
suppose
that
there's
a
need
to
have
claims
the
bankruptcy
to
that
for
state
plan,
are
you
not
suppose
to
illustrates
this
but
--
in
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
but
the
--
your
relative
decisions
that
this
is
going
to
be
distributed
by
the
rail?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
want
actually
the
bankruptcy
act
may
not
actually
a
more
than
--
justice
byron
r.
white
special
court
decides
on
this?
