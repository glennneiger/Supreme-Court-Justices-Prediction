justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
are
three
appeals
and
a
cross-appeal
from
a
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania
that
declared
unconstitutional
the
regional
rail
reorganization
act
of
1973
and
enjoined
its
enforcement.
the
ground
of
the
decision
was
that
the
rail
act
would
affect
a
taking
for
public
use
without
just
compensation
of
the
rail
properties
of
the
bankrupt
penn-central
railroad
because
the
rail
act
precluded
a
suit
against
the
united
states
in
the
court
of
claims
under
the
tucker
act
for
a
cash
award
in
the
amount
of
any
shortfall
from
the
constitutional
minimum
in
the
securities
provided
by
the
rail
act
to
be
paid
for
the
rail
properties.
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
rail
act
does
not
preclude
a
tucker
act
remedy
for
any
shortfall
that
may
occur.
mr.
justice
douglas
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
on
three
ground
one
of
which
is
that
the
tucker
act
remedy
is
not
available.
mr.
justice
stewart
also
dissents
and
has
filed
a
statement
agreeing
substantially
with
justice
douglas'
reasons
why
the
tucker
act
remedy
is
not
available.
