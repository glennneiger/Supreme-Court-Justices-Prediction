mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
by
the
united
states
other
federal
parties,
united
states
rail
association
and
the
trustees
of
the
property
of
the
penn
central
transportation
company.
a
three-judge
district
court
determined
that
the
regional
rail
reorganization
act
of
1973
is
constitutionally
deficient
in
significant
aspects.
the
united
states
support
the
constitutionality
of
that
act.
there
is
also
a
cross
appeal
here
by
the
trustee
of
the
new
haven
railroad
to
have
the
act
declared
unconstitutional
on
grounds
rejected
by
the
district
court.
the
appellees
here
on
our
appeal
comprise
the
sole
shareholder
and
the
major
creditors
of
the
penn
central
transportation
company,
a
railroad
that
will
be
important
in
any
reorganization
effective
under
the
rail
act.
time
for
argument
is
divided
equally
between
the
supporters
of
the
act
and
the
opponents
of
the
act.
the
supporters
have
divided
our
time
as
follows.
mr.
cutler
who
represent
the
rail
association
and
i
will
divide
an
hour
and
13
minutes,
though
we
hope
to
reserve
some
if
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
cutler
will
deal
with
the
issues
raised
by
the
cross
appeal.
i
will
deal
with
the
issues
raised
by
our
appeal.
and
congressman
adams
has
been
seated
five
minutes
to
support
the
act
on
somewhat
different
grounds
with
those
advanced
by
mr.
cutler
and
myself.
mr.
horsky
for
the
penn
central
trustees,
who
supports
our
position
in
part
and
opposes
it
in
part
perhaps
now
supports
it
will
use
the
remainder
of
our
time,
plus
some
of
the
other
sides
time.
he
is
in
effect
a
bridge
between
the
two
sides.
this
litigation
is
crucial
to
the
success
or
failure
of
congress's
plan
to
reorganize
and
to
make
viable
the
real
network
in
the
northeast.
and
the
case
bears,
i
think,
as
you
look
at
the
briefs
a
circus
appearance
of
enormous
complexity.
but
i
think,
it
is
quite
simple
in
its
basic
concepts.
the
core
issue
before
us
is
whether
the
rail
act
will
work
in
uncompensated
taking
of
the
shareholders
and
creditors'
property
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
the
three-judge
district
court
vowed
that
it
would.
the
three-judge
special
court
created
by
the
rail
act
itself
has
more
recently
held
that
it
would
not
and
that
the
statute
was
therefore
constitutional.
it
will
be
useful
to
sketch,
i
think,
the
real
crisis
in
the
northeastern
united
states.
the
main
features
of
the
act
that
its
congress
has
response
to
that
crisis
and
the
holding
of
the
district
court
which
emasculates
congress'
effort.
by
1973,
seven
major
railroads
in
the
northeast
were
attempting
to
reorganize
under
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
those
proceedings
were
proven
unsuccessful
due
to
the
seemingly
insoluble
financial
difficulties
of
the
roads.
the
imminence
of
financial
collapse
and
the
possible
liquidation
of
this
northeast
rail
network,
threatened
the
immeasurable
damage
to
the
economy
and
to
the
national
defense.
congress
responded
with
the
rail
reorganization
act
we
have
before
us.
the
primary
purpose
of
that
act
is
to
create
a
new,
profitable,
privately
owned
rail
system
in
the
northeast
and
most
importantly
to
do
that
rapidly,
much
more
rapidly
than
is
the
custom
under
reorganization
under
section
77
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
within
180
days
of
the
statutes
enactment,
each
court
having
jurisdiction
over
a
railroad
and
reorganization
was
required
to
order
that
the
reorganization
proceed
under
the
new
rail
act.
unless
it
first,
one,
found
that
the
railroad
was
recognizable
on
an
income
basis
within
a
reasonable
time
and
that
the
public
interest
would
be
better
served
by
that
form
of
reorganization.
or
two,
found
that
the
rail
act
does
not
provide
a
process
which
will
be
fair
and
equitable
to
the
estate
of
the
railroad
and
reorganization
in
which
case
the
reorganization
is
to
be
dismissed.
appeal
from
this
180-day
decision
by
the
reorganization
courts
lies
to
a
special
court
created
by
the
act
and
that
court
is
composed
now
of
judges
friendly,
mcgowan,
and
thompson.
five
of
the
reorganization
courts
found
that
the
act
did
not
provide
a
fair
inequitable
process,
two
founded
that
it
did.
the
appeals
were
taken
and
the
special
court
has
now
found
that
the
reorganization
act
does
provide
a
fair
and
equitable
process
and
that
decision
explicitly
includes
that
the
termination
of
the
act
will
not
work
an
uncompensated
taking.
the
act
also
establishes
united
states
rail
association,
which
is
a
public
nonprofit
corporation
and
it
is
required
to
formulate
a
final
system
plan
that
will
establish
and
maintain
a
financially
self-sustaining
rail
system
adequate
to
the
needs
of
the
northeast.
the
centerpiece
of
this
final
system
plan
is
to
be
a
new
for
profit
corporation,
a
consolidated
rail
corporation,
conrail.
the
bulk
of
the
rail
properties
will
go
to
conrail,
although,
some
maybe
sold
under
the
final
system
plan
to
profitable
railroads
in
the
area,
to
amtrak,
and
to
state
and
local
transportation
authorities.
this
plan
is
to
be
laid
before
congress
within
450
days
of
the
passage
of
the
rail
act,
although,
the
rail
association
has
now
requested
to
congress
a
120-day
extension
of
that
deadline.
the
final
system
plan
becomes
effective,
if
it
is
not
disapproved
by
either
house
within
60
session
days.
within
90
days
after
that,
the
plan
is
to
be
certified
to
the
special
court.
the
special
court
will
then
order
the
transfer
out
of
the
rail
properties
from
the
bankrupt
estates
to
conrail
and
have
the
securities
and
obligations
and
benefits
of
conrail
transferred
back
to
the
bankrupt
estates.
subsequently,
it
will
determine
the
fairness
and
the
equity
of
the
consideration
given
in
return
to
these
states
and
that
consideration,
a
package
of
securities
and
benefits
given
is
not
to
exceed
the
constitutional
minimum.
now
that
consideration
given
to
the
bankrupt
estates,
the
rail
estates,
is
to
consist
of
stock
and
securities
of
conrail
and
up
to
$500
million
of
the
association's
obligations,
which
are
held
by
conrail
and
which
are
federally
guaranteed
and
other
benefits
under
the
act
such
as
payments
for
labor
termination
and
so
forth.
if
this
consideration
exceeds
the
constitutional
minimum,
the
court
must
order
the
excess
returned.
it
may
reallocate
the
consideration
among
the
transfer
or
rail
estates
and
if
necessary,
it
may
enter
a
deficiency
judgment
in
the
estates'
favor
against
conrail
or
against
profitable
railroads
that
receive
property
from
these
--
the
bankrupt
estates.
the
entire
judgment
of
the
special
court
on
the
evaluation
issue
is
then
reviewable
by
this
court.
now,
although
the
constitutionality
of
this
statutory
scheme
was
being
litigated
in
various
reorganization
courts.
these
cases
were
brought
in
district
courts,
not
reorganization
courts
by
the
penn
central
shareholder
and
by
the
major
creditors.
they
were
consolidated
by
the
judicial
panel
on
multidistrict
litigation
in
the
three-judge
district
court.
now,
that
court
from
which
we
appeal
determined
as
follow.
it
said
first,
that
the
question
whether
the
final
transfer
of
rail
properties
from
the
rail
estates
to
conrail
would
affect
an
unconstitutional
taking
was
not
yet
right
for
adjudication.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
nothing
here,
the
special
court
opinion
is
available
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
i
believe
the
briefs
now
refer
to
it.
but
there
is
no
appeal
here
from
the
special
court.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
under
the
statute,
it
is
not
considered
an
appeal.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
could
be
another
question
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
trust
it
will
not
become
one
in
this
case.
second,
there
is
the
problem
of
interim
erosion
which
the
three-judge
district
court
of
the
bankrupt
estates
--
three
of
the
courts
that
the
interim
erosion
that
is
the
losses
incurred
by
these
railroads
in
continuing
service
prior
to
the
final
transferred
date
might
amount
to
a
taking
in
the
fifth
amendment
since
they
thought
that
taking
may
have
occurred
or
may
soon
occur,
at
least
there
was
a
possibility
and
therefore,
that
issue
of
interim
erosion
is
right
for
adjudication.
the
court
therefore
enjoined
the
rail
association
from
acting
under
section
304
(f)
of
the
rail
act,
to
prohibit
any
reduction
of
service
that
is
requested
and
that
maybe
determined
by
a
court
to
be
necessary
to
prevent
an
unconstitutional
taking
of
property.
third,
the
court
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
section
20
(b),
which
requires
the
dismissal
of
the
reorganization
proceeding
under
certain
circumstances
that
stage
of
the
case
has
passed
and
i
think
that
ruling
has
now
essentially
become
irrelevant.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
did
appeal
in
the
special
court
has
held
that
the
act
was
fair
and
equitable,
so
we
are
passed
the
stage
at
which
a
dismissal
of
a
reorganization
pursuant
to
207
(b)
is
a
possibility.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
not
entirely
clear
to
me
that
particular
point
of
dismissing
the
reorganization
in
the
event
that
this
act
did
not
provide
a
fair
and
equitable
process.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
perhaps
the
court
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
is
justice
--
i
do
not
have
it.
perhaps,
mr.
cutler
maybe
able
to
answer
the
question
of
that,
but
in
any
event,
i
think
207
(b)
is
effectively
behind
this
because
no
such
dismissals
occurred
and
under
the
ruling
of
special
court
would
not
as
--.
finally,
the
court
without
particularly
stating
any
reasons
enjoined
the
associations
from
certifying
a
final
system
plan
for
judicial
review
under
the
provisions
of
section
209
(c).
now,
this
injunction
against
certifying
a
final
system
plan
to
the
special
court
respectively
prevents
the
consummation
of
the
congressional
plan
or
creating
this
new
conrail
and
that
means
in
effect
that
the
statute
is
at
that
stage
understands
still
and
cannot
under
going
to
affect.
now,
there
have
been
many
contentions
here
and
i
think
for
most
of
them
perhaps
rely
upon
the
briefs.
the
briefs
have
been
perhaps
some
10
to
12
inches
thick.
but
i
wish
to
say
at
the
outset
that
after
further
analysis
since
we
have
submitted
our
briefs
and
after
considering
the
special
court
opinion,
we
have
modified
the
position
taken
in
our
briefs.
we
now
think
that
this
appeal
turns
almost
entirely
upon
the
tucker
act
question.
that
was
the
--
of
person's
whose
property
is
taken
to
go
into
the
court
of
claims
to
get
compensation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
do,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
effect,
we
say
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
we
do
not
think
there
will
be
an
unconstitutional
role
and
i
think
the
special
court
is
quite
persuasive
about
the
unlikelihood
of
a
interim
or
role
amounting
to
the
constitution
i
think.
we
also
don't
--
but
we
also
think
that
the
conrail
is
likely
to
be
a
financially
viable
for
railroad
and
that
there
will
be
no
unconstitutional
taking
at
the
final
transfer.
but
we
must
conceive
that
we
can
give
no
absolute
guarantee
on
either
of
those
voice
and
there
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
and
i
would
not
put
at
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
act
would
then
become
unconstitutional
at
large.
i
think
a
better
result
would
be
to
continue
the
injunctions
at
the
304
(f)
and
as
to
303,
the
final
transfer
provisions.
so,
that
congress
could
then
if
there
were
no
tucker
act
remedy
available.
congress
could
then
consider
whether
it
wanted
to
provide
the
tucker
act
remedy
or
whether
it
wanted
in
some
other
way
to
deal
with
the
statute
in
order
to
keep
this
reorganization
plan
which
is
really
our
only
government
on
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
timetable.
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
was
referring
to
the
enormous
complexity
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
heroic
effort.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
douglas,
it
is
not
--
it
is
simply
that
--
oh,
you
mean
the
fact
that
the
change
of
position
is
not
even
that.
no,
because
we
thought
that
there
before
we
admitted
the
possibility,
the
conceptual
possibility
of
a
taking.
we
--
what
we
thought
it
factually
so
unlikely
is
not
to
be
in
the
case
given
the
financial
situation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
question
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
am
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
am
not
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
that
we
cannot
tell
know
whether
or
not
the
final
transfer
will
effect
--
will
in
fact
affect
a
taking.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
want
to
make
a
distinction
between
this.
the
three-judge
court
is
right
to
the
extent
it
says,
"we
cannot
tell
now
whether
or
not
there
will
in
fact,
would
be
a
taking
at
the
final
transfer."
however,
i
think
we
can
tell
now
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
we
cannot
tell
for
a
fact
that
there
will
be
erosion.
however,
we
can
tell
that
it
is.
we
cannot
guarantee
there
will
not
be
a
taking
and
i
think
it
would
be
legally
difficult
to
say
that,
creditors
must
gamble
and
go
down
to
the
wire
with
no
possibility
of
compensation,
if
they
loose,
and
discover
at
the
final
--
after
the
final
transfer
date
that
there
had
been
a
taking,
and
if
no
compensation
was
available.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
that
issue
is
not
right.
however,
it
is
i
think
not
premature
to
decide
that
that
possibility
exists.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
and
that
therefore,
the
tucker
act
issue
is
a
criminal
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
only
if
one
assumes
that
the
conrail
stock,
if
one
gets
reason
to
know
that
the
conrail
stock
would
in
fact
be
an
adequate
compensation
from
what
they
gave
up.
i
would
think
they
could
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i
think
not
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
if
there
was
also
an
distinction
that
there
was
no
tucker
act
remedy
available,
so
that
deciding
it
then
will
do
no
good
because
there
is
no
way
you
be
compensated.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct,
but
here,
it
is
quite
likely
that--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
well
in
this
case.
this
act
provides
that
this
property
will
be
transferred
from
the
rail
estates
to
this
conrail
to
other
profitable
railroads
to
amtrak,
to
state
and
local
transportation
authorities.
and
then,
some
years
will
passed
while
we
litigate
the
issue
of
whether
or
what
those
rail
estates
got
back
was
adequate
compensation.
should
it
prove
not
to
be
adequate
compensation?
at
that
point,
there
is
now
way
this
--
there
maybe
no
way
these
creditors
can
be
made
whole.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
section
303
of
this
act,
mr.
chief
justice,
does
not
turnout
to
provide
adequate
compensation
and
if
it
should
turnout
that
they
have
no
tucker
act
remedy
available,
there
would
have
been
an
uncompensated
taking
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
there
could
not
because
the
section
303
specifically
limits
the
special
court
in
what
it
can
do
and
it
can
add
nothing
to
the
benefits
provided
by
the
act,
the
stock
and
securities
of
conrail,
and
a
deficiency
judgment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
act
specifically
provides
that
that
evaluation
decision
is
appealable
to
this
court.
there
is
no
problem
about
appealability
of
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
quite
true,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
quite
right.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
because
mr.
stewart
is
in
fact
raising
the
analogy
of
a
statute
which
said,
"in
the
end
of
five
years,
we
will
flip
a
coin,
if
it
is
heads,
you
get
paid
off
in
full,
if
it
is
tails,
you
get
nothing,
if
you
get
nothing,
there
is
no
tucker
act
remedy
and
you
are
just
out
of
your
property."
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
you
wait
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
would
seem
to
me
its
trifle
it
adds
with
a
jurisprudence
to
tell
a
man
that
there
is
a
50/50
chance
his
property
will
be
taken
under
the
statute
and
that
if
it
is,
he
will
have
no
remedy
and
he
may
not
try
to
enjoin
the
statute
in
advance,
but
must
go
forward
and
take
his
50/50
chance.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
statute
is
in
effect
now
and
the
mechanism
leading
toward
this
result
is
in
full
swing,
and
if
these
parties,
i
hate
to
be
making
there
case,
but
if
these
parties
has
to
wait
until
that
date,
they
are
without
remedy,
and
i
do
not
think
that
that
--.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
because
the
three-judge
district
court
remedy
then,
will
do
them
no
good.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
i
mean
why
won't
we
wait
on
separate
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
we
will
be
in
no
better
position
at
that
time
to
know
anything
about
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
taking
will
be
immanent,
but
we
will
not
know
whether
the
compensation
to
be
paid
is
adequate
or
not
because
this
statute
provides
that
the
property
will
be
taken
before
evaluation
proceedings
begin
and
it
will
be
some
years
after,
this
is
enormously
complex
evaluation
proceedings
or
at
least
lengthy
one.
it
will
be
some
years
after
the
taking
occurs
before
anybody
knows
whether
they
are
to
be
compensated.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
true,
but
at
least,
we
will
know
with
the
tucker
act
that
the
compensation
will
be
there.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
may
not
feel
happy
while
they
are
waiting
mr.
justice
white,
but
their
constitutional
rights
will
not
have
been
infringed.
we
should
do
something
some
degree
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true,
but
can't
be
sure
they
will.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
but
i
think
we
are,
but
i
think
that's
-i
think
the
right
in
this
issue
will
not
change
in
this
case
until
it
is
too
late.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i've
always
thought
that
tucker
act
was
right.
we
never
argued
that.
i
do
not
think
the
question
of
whether
a
taking
will
in
fact
occur
can
be
known
now
and
it
isn't
right.
but
the
possibility
that
will
occur
is
clearly
present
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
the
tucker
act
issue
is
clearly
right.
the
--
if
the
tucker
act
has
been
limited
so
that
there
can
be
no
compensation
either
for
interim
erosion
or
interim
erosion.
then,
we
would
agree
that
if
the
injunction
under
--
about
section
304
which
prevents
the
rail
association
from
denying
abandonments
--
when
a
taking
point
has
occurred
should
either
be
made
in
effect
or
preferably
the
statute
should
be
read
to
deny
the
rail
association.
the
power
to
refuse
abandonments
at
a
point
when
the
courts
hold
an
unconstitutional
take
is
occurring.
and
if
the
tucker
act
has
been
limited,
we
agree
that
an
injunction
against
certification
of
a
final
system
plan
to
the
special
court
should
remain
in
effect.
i
think
that's
preferable
to
striking
down
the
entire
rail
act
on
the
theory
of
unconstitutionality
because
leaving
those
injunctions
in
effect,
would
give
congress
a
time
to
reconsider
the
tucker
act
issue
and
time
to
reconsider
the
possibility
of
making
changes
in
the
rail
act
to
obviate
these
difficulties.
because
this
is
an
enormous
effort
by
the
congress
and
i
think
that
ought
not
be
tossed
aside
wholesale
without
giving
congress
time.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
these
two
injunctions
or
reading
the
statute
in
those
ways
would
effectively
protect
the
creditor
interest
against
an
unconstitutional
taking.
and
also,
give
congress
the
option
to
reconsider
what
it
wishes
to
do.
but,
we
agree
in
the
taking
as
unlikely
in
the
constitutional
sense
and
having
made
those
concessions
and
put
myself
on
the
wrong
side
counsel
table
for
this
period
of
time.
i
now
would
likely
to
address
our
case.
we
think
the
judgment
of
three-judge
court
ought
to
be
reversed.
nonetheless,
because
we
think
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
the
tucker
act
remedy
is
available
and
was
not
repealed
by
the
rail
act.
there
is
therefore,
no
basis
for
these
injunctions
requiring
abandonments
when
erosion
reaches
the
point
of
a
taking
or
for
injunction
against
certification
of
the
final
system
plan.
the
tucker
act
provides
impertinent
part
the
court
of
claims
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
render
judgment
upon
any
claim
against
the
united
states
founded
upon
just
constitution.
now,
that's
a
general
branch
of
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims
and
it
is
available
for
any
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment,
unless
it
is
withdrawn
by
congress.
the
three-judge
district
court,
we
think,
misstated
the
issue
as
whether
congress
intended
to
grant
a
tucker
act
remedy.
i
don't
think
congress
did
deliberately
intend
to
grant
a
tucker
act
remedy
in
the
rail
act.
the
special
court
correctly
opposed
the
issue
as
whether
congress
in
the
rail
act
intentionally
barred
the
tucker
act
remedy.
the
rule
is
that
the
tucker
act
is
available
for
a
taking
into
the
constitution
unless
it
is
removed,
not
unless
it
is
start
off
and
granted.
the
united
states
cause
the
--
is
a
case
for
the
taking
of
an
easement
over
a
chicken
farm
by
a
low
flying
aircraft.
it
is
a
case
where
congress
did
not
intend
a
taking
and
a
case
where
congress
did
not
intend
compensation.
those
factors
were
irrelevant.
the
tucker
act
was
available
because
a
taking
had
occurred
by
lawful
authorized
action
of
the
government.
it
seems
to
be
perfectly
plain
therefore,
that
these
appellees
have
a
tucker
act
remedy
unless
the
rail
act
specifically
withdraws
it.
there
is
no
explicit
limitation
of
the
tucker
act
anywhere
in
this
enormously
detailed
39
page
rendered
statute.
the
tucker
act
is
not
even
mentioned
in
the
statute
and
that
would
seem
surely
be
very
oversight
if
repeal
was
intended.
i
think,
we
must
therefore
examine
the
act
to
see
if
there
is
a
clearly
implied
repeal.and
in
doing
so,
we
have
employed
two
canons
of
construction.
now,
appellee's
counsels
have
had
some
fun
with
the
use
of
these
canons
of
construction
as
i
would
by
their
side
of
the
case.
but
these
are
canons
long
known
to
the
law
and
they
binding
up
on
congress
in
drafting
statute
because
that's
how
they
know
how
the
statute
will
be
interpreted
as
they
are
indispensable
to
courts
in
interpreting
statutes.
i
sight
just
two.
the
first
is
that
repeals
by
implication
are
not
favored
in
our
law.
the
second
is
that
when
there
are
two
admissible
constructions
of
a
statute,
that
construction
which
will
save
the
constitutionality
in
the
statute
is
favored
over
that
which
condemns
the
act.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
opponents
of
the
rail
act
here
are
asking
for
a
partial
repeal
of
the
tucker
act
by
implication.
they
also
urge
reconstruction
of
the
rail
act
that
they
say
does
result
in
its
unconstitutionality.
they
have
their
own
canon
of
construction
and
they
are
precisely
the
opposite
of
those
that
the
law
recognizes.
now
the
strength
of
this
presumption
against
complied
repeals,
i
think
it's
much
greater
in
the
tucker
act
area
than
perhaps
it
is
elsewhere
and
that
shown
i
think
by
two
cases.
i
would
like
to
mention.
the
first
is
hurley
against
kincaid
and
the
second
is
lynch
against
united
states.
although,
decisions
of
this
court
retain
their
vitality
as
i
think
they
do.
then,
i
think
they
are
completely
dispositive
of
the
tucker
act
question
here.
the
special
court
in
judge
friendly's
opinion
said
that
hurley
against
kincaid
did
not
support
our
position
as
strongly
as
we
had
urged,
but
it
went
on
the
note
that
there
was
case
called
lynch,
which
we
had
not
sited
which
did
support
our
position.
we
oblige
as
we
accept
the
gift
of
lynch
but
we
continue
to
believe
that
hurley
against
kincaid
has
pertinence
here
as
well.
in
that
case,
the
point
of
kincaid
conceded
to
enjoin
the
construction
of
flood
way
that
threatened
his
land.
in
section
3
of
the
flood
control
act
under
which
the
government
was
proceeding
stated
that,
no
liability
of
any
kind
shall
attach
to
rest
upon
the
united
states
for
any
damage
from
replied
floods.
section
4
of
the
act
provided
for
advance
compensation
for
the
taking
of
land
by
condemnation
of
necessary
lands
and
easements.
now,
the
parties
advance
as
here
a
wide
variety
of
factual
legal
contentions.
but
the
supreme
court
held
simply
that
the
injunction
should
not
issue
because
the
event
that
taking
occurred,
the
complainant
can
recover
just
compensation
under
the
tucker
act
in
compensation
of
the
law,
an
enactment
law.
hurley
against
kincaid
now
stands
at
a
minimum
where
two
prepositions
that
a
statutory
program
may
not
be
enjoined
in
anticipation
of
a
taking
where
the
tucker
act
is
available.
and
this
is
a
case
i
suppose
that
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
the
rightness
of
a
tucker
issue
is
clear.
a
statutory
program
may
not
be
enjoined
in
anticipation
of
a
taking
where
a
tucker
act
remedy
is
available.
and
secondly,
that
the
repeal
of
the
tucker
act
is
not
to
be
implied
from
the
presence
in
the
program
statute
of
an
alternative
method
of
compensating
those
whose
property
is
taken.
these
prepositions
are
highly
relevant
here.
the
--
those
who
seek
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
the
rail
act
argued
that
the
implied
repeal
of
the
tucker
act
is
to
be
found
in
section
303
of
the
rail
act.
among
other
places,
tried
section
303
provides
modes
of
compensating
the
bankrupt
estates
or
rail
properties
transferred
under
the
final
system
plan.
and
they
say
that,
the
existence
in
the
rail
act
of
alternative
modes
of
compensation
implies
the
absence
of
any
other
form
of
compensation.
i
think
that
would
be
a
thin
argument
for
repeal
of
the
tucker
act
at
best.
the
court
has
asked
to
find
an
imply
appeal
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
the
constitutionality
of
the
very
statute
to
which
the
repeal
is
attributed.
so
far
as
we
know,
no
case
has
ever
found
an
implied
repeal
in
order
to
impute
to
the
statute
itself
an
intention
to
commit
suicide.
if
there
is
any
doubt
on
this
issue,
i
think
hurley
against
kincaid
lays
into
rest.
the
flood
control
act
provided
its
own
means
of
property
acquisition
and
compensation
for
taking
to
find
an
implied
repeal
in
hurley
against
kincaid
would
be
much
easier
because
all
that
would
have
happen
would
have
been
an
injunction
would
have
been
issue
and
slow
the
progress
of
the
work
until
a
condemnation
occur.
so,
that
only
inconvenience
was
involved
in
finding
an
implied
repeal
there.
here,
to
find
an
implied
repeal
is
to
find
the
act
unconstitutional
in
major
aspects
and
bring
the
program
to
a
complete
all.
lynch
against
united
states,
the
case
found
by
judge
friendly
reinforces
rather
than
replaces
kincaid
in
our
argument.
in
that
case,
actions
were
brought
for
proceeds
of
government
insurance
policies.
the
insured
in
each
case
has
become
totally
disabled
while
the
policies
were
enforced.
under
the
policies
terms
in
such
circumstances,
compensation
must
be
given
to
pay
the
premiums
of
the
policies.
the
compensation
was
not
given
and
the
insurance
died.
united
states
demurred
to
this
lawsuit
on
the
ground
that
section
7
of
the
economy
act,
section
17
of
the
economy
act
of
1933
stated
specifically,
all
laws
granting
or
pertaining
to
yearly
renewable
term
insurance
are
hereby
repealed,
a
much
more
explicit
and
clear
repealer
than
anything
to
found
in
this
case.
this
supreme
court
held
that
as
applied
to
contract
rights,
that
repealer
was
a
taking
of
property
forbidden
by
the
fifth
amendment.
but
the
congress
of
course,
did
have
the
power
to
withdraw
its
consent
to
suit
against
united
states.
and
the
government
argued
here
that
it
was
obvious
that
when
congress
took
away
the
right,
it
should
be
presumed
to
have
contended
to
takeaway
the
remedy
which
it
seems
to
be
a
rather
plausible
argument.
nevertheless,
this
court
refused
to
read
the
statute
is
taking
away
the
remedy
in
the
absence
of
a
multi-explicit
direction.
it
said,
"there
is
no
separate
provision
in
section
17
dealing
with
the
remedy
and
it
does
not
appear
that
congress
wish
to
deny
the
remedy,
if
the
repeal
of
the
contractual
right
was
held
void
under
the
fifth
amendment.
now
judge
friendly
points
out
the
exact
application
of
this
reasoning
to
our
case
by
saying,
"translated
into
the
terms
of
this
case.
there
is
no
separate
provision
in
the
rail
reorganization
act
dealing
with
the
tucker
act
remedy
and
it
does
not
appear
that
congress
wished
deny
this
remedy,
if
the
act
should
be
held
to
involve
a
possible
taking
that
would
require
the
award
of
a
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment.
so
lynch
demonstrates,
i
think
the
court
is
not
willing
to
find
the
repeal
of
the
tucker
act
remedy
unless
congress
specifically
states
that
what
--
that's
what
wants
a
much
stronger
indication
in
the
economy
act
than
there
is
here.
now,
these
conclusions
from
hurley
and
lynch
which
i
think
are
dispositive
of
this
case
are
strengthened
by
examining
the
rail
act,
its
text,
its
structure,
its
legislative
history,
and
finally
views
now
pressed
upon
us
by
the
compress
it
upon
you
by
some
members
of
the
house
of
representatives.
the
tax
to
the
rail
act
i
submit
yields
only
one
implausible
explanation.
the
tucker
act
is
not
mentioned
and
yet,
there
are
13
provisions
in
the
rail
act
which
deal
with
the
relationship
of
other
statutes
to
the
rail
act.
congress
went
through
quite
specifically
repealing
in
part,
modifying
in
part,
and
dealing
with
the
relationships
of
other
statutes.
in
13
places
and
i
refer
you
to
section
601,
which
deals
with
major
statutes
and
specifically
entitle
a
relationship
to
other
statutes.
and
it
seems
quite
peculiar
to
say
that,
congress
took
meticulous
care
to
spell
out
the
repeal
of
advertising
requirements
having
to
do
with
the
entry
of
government
contracts.
but
did
not
think
it
was
worth
mentioning
that
it
was
contemplating
the
uncompensated
taking
of
property.
that
is
not
just
improper
statutory
construction.
i
think
it
is
bizarre
statutory
construction.
if
we
look
to
the
structure
of
the
act,
we
see
the
same
thing.
section
304
(f)
shows
that
very
few
abandonments
are
to
be
permitted.
but
eventhough
there
are
steady
losses
because
these
lines
must
be
preserved
for
inclusion
in
the
final
system
plan.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i'm
not
quite
sure
about
either
the
same
kind
of
argument
i
would
use.
i
think
the
three-judge
--
his
referring
to
the
fact
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
made
that
question
of
congress'
intent
there
is
unclear,
but
i
think
there
are
separate
reasons
for
saying
that
the
three-judge
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction.
and
therefore,
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
i'll
be
willing
to
address
myself
to
that
--
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
not
that
i
know.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
order
to
find
a
repeal
of
the
tucker
act,
we
have
to
be
asked
to
belief
that
the
congress
knowingly
insisted
upon
continued
operations
knew
that
they
might
cause
losses
and
for
that
reason
repeal
the
tucker
act
because
it
did
not
want
to
compensate.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
the
final
system,
final
transfer
provisions
in
section
303.
we
are
asked
to
believe
that
congress
knowingly
required
to
transfer
and
knew
might
conceivably
fall
short
of
just
compensation
and
yet
intended
that
that
should
occur
not
to
compensate.
indeed,
there
is
no
reason
here
to
impute
any
implied
repeal
of
the
tucker
act
to
congress
except
to
impute
the
congress
a
desire
not
to
pay
as
it
turned
out
that
there
was
no
constitutional
taking
and
i
do
not
think
that
kind
of
intent
ever
ought
to
be
imputed
to
congress,
unless
congress
makes
that
imputation
unavoidable
by
specific
language.
maybe
that
congress
never
even
thought
about
the
tucker
act.
i
think
that's
quite
likely,
but
if
it
mandated
a
course
of
behavior
that
results
in
the
taking
that
is
enough
to
make
the
tucker
act
remedy
available.
i
won't
follow
the
legislative
history
because
the
legislative
history
shows
no
more
than
that
congress
was
not
thinking
about
the
tucker
act
and
congress
thought
that
section
303
would
provide
adequate
compensation,
but
if
they
are
wrong,
we
think
the
tucker
act
is
available.
now,
i
want
to
spend
a
moment
addressing
myself
because
there
is
nothing
left
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
in
tucker
act
point
except,
we
are
offered
the
views
of
a
number
of
congressmen
as
to
what
they
intended
when
they
ask
the
tucker
act.
and
congressman
brooke
adams
will
speak
for
them
here.
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
sincerity
of
their
views
and
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
is
to
the
accuracy
of
their
statement
of
their
intention.
but
i
object
to
their
consideration
of
statement
of
intention
on
the
grounds
that
they
didn't
wait
when
worker
radical
reconstruction
in
the
constitutional
relationship
between
congress
and
this
court.
this
court
discerns
like
it
have
been
intended
in
the
statute
were
debates
from
the
records.
it
should
not
look
to
what
individual
congress
say
they
intended
afterwards
when
those
intentions
were
never
expressed
to
the
senate,
to
the
house
that
adopted
the
bill
or
to
the
president
who
signed
in
the
law.
we
do
not
know
what
the
results
would
have
been
if
the
tucker
act
issue
have
been
explored
in
congress
or
relayed
before
the
president.
but
even
if
there
were
a
brief
here
from
a
majority
of
both
houses,
my
argument
would
be
the
same.
the
constitution
provides
for
a
legislative
process
and
perhaps,
if
the
minority
--
if
these
views
and
issues
had
been
aired,
perhaps
the
minority
would
have
convinced
the
others
on
this
issue.
and
it
is
simply
wrong
to
take
views
expressed
afterwards
which
never
went
though
the
legislative
process
and
visit
by
the
constitution.
if
a
present
statement
of
prior
legislative
intent
were
given
effect,
i
think
we
might
have
to
have
a
different
kind
of
trial
when
we
went
into
legislative
history.
we
might
have
to
examine
or
take
affidavits
from
congressman
as
to
what
they
thought
about
issues,
in
fact
when
they
voted
on
the
law.
as
to
many
statutes,
that
would
be
impossible.
i
suggest
to
that
in
all
of
it
would
be
improper.
we
are
becoming
getting
dangerously
close
at
that
stage
to
the
method
of
statutory
analysis
which
was
rejected
by
this
court
and
by
chief
justice
marshall
in
fletcher
against
craig
and
he
answer
when
broad
case.
now,
i
make
this
argument
solely
out
of
concern
for
the
law
and
the
proper
processes
of
interpreting
statutes.
if
i
am
wrong,
if
my
submission
is
rejected,
i
would
be
sorry
for
the
law
but
i
would
quite
glad
for
my
position
in
this
case
because
i
think
congressman
adams'
brief.
if
we
are
to
consider
his
statement
of
what
congress
intended
supports
the
position
i
have
been
arguing.
he
said
on
page
17,
the
tucker
act
was
not
considered
by
the
congress
in
creating
the
rail
act.
it
is
a
jurisdictional
statute
often
used
to
settle
private
claims
that
was
neither
repealed
nor
engrafted
onto
the
act
to
create
a
possible
deficiency
judgment
against
the
government.
that
seems
to
me,
if
you
consider
this
expose
fact
those
statements
of
legislative
intent
to
be
precisely
in
line
with
our
contention
that
when
congress
doesn't
consider
the
tucker
act,
but
does
something
that
affects
a
taking
that
tucker
act
remains
unavailable
remedy.
now,
congressman
adams
and
others
expressed
a
fear
that
we
are
and
they
would
giving
the
rail
estates
the
key
to
the
treasury.
there's
no
basis
for
that
concern.
that
congress
and
not
the
department
of
justice
controls
the
first
and
should
this
court
agree
that
the
tucker
act
remedy
remains
available
here.
congress
may
have
wishes
the
following
date
repeal
the
tucker
act
that
it
applies
to
this
case
or
make
any
other
amendments
to
the
rail
act
that
it
wishes.
the
final
disposition
of
this
entire
matter
is
for
congress,
whichever
way
this
case
goes,
are
we
talking
is
to
discern
the
legal
situation
as
congress
has
left
it
so
far.
now,
i
would
like
to
close
at
hypothetical,
i
think
illustrates
the
strength
of
our
position.
suppose
our
position
were
emerged
in
the
tucker
act
issue
because
but
suppose
this
litigation
did
not
occur
now.
but
we
went
down
the
road
for
five
years
and
discover
that
they
have
been
occurred.
these
creditors
sue
us
in
the
court
of
claims
and
the
government
comes
in
and
demurs
on
the
grounds
that
the
rail
act
has
impliedly
repealed
the
tucker
act.
it
is
true
we
have
taken
your
property
but
then
we
are
terribly
sorry,
but
there
is
nothing
can
be
done
about
it
because
we
can
find
in
an
implied
repeal
of
the
tucker
act
in
the
rail
act.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
argument
wouldn't
stand
a
chance
in
the
court
of
claims
or
in
this
court.
the
cases
were
not
implied
repeal
under
those
circumstances
would
be
seen
to
be
artificial
then
unjust
and
fully
unpersuasive.
but
the
legal
issues
are
precisely
the
same
in
that
case
as
they
are
in
this
case
and
we
submit
that
they
should
be
decided
the
same
way.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
nothing
further,
unless
there
are
some
questions.
