mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
new
haven
trustee,
the
cross
appellant
attacks
the
procedures
of
the
rail
act
for
the
final
transfers
of
properties
pursuant
to
the
final
system
plan
and
he
argues
that
these
procedures
are
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment.
in
our
brief
as
appellee,
we
argue
that
the
court
below
correctly
rejected
this
attack
as
premature.
but
now
that
the
special
court
has
rejected
the
same
attack
on
its
merits
and
the
statute
purports
to
barred
direct
review
of
that
decision,
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
and
with
mr.
horsky
who
will
argue
the
point
in
more
detail.
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
exercise
of
these
court's
discretion
to
reach
and
decide
these
issues
on
this
appeal.
as
to
the
tucker
act,
it
seems
to
us
it
is
really
an
academic
point
anyway
because
if
you
rich
the
tucker
act
issues
on
erosion.
whatever
you
decide
as
to
that
will
necessarily,
we
believe,
decide
the
availability
of
the
tucker
act
as
to
the
final
transfers.
while
it's
quite
true
that
the
other
issues
that
mr.
justice
white
suggested
could
be
raised
at
some
later
date
in
other
three-judge
court
proceeding.
some
of
the
damage
would
already
have
been
done.
the
congress
and
the
bankruptcy
courts
are
now
preceding
to
carryout
their
responsibilities
in
resolving
the
eastern
rail
prices
under
the
tight
timetables
of
the
act.
there
would
be
a
critical
waste
of
time
and
resources
it
now
seems
to
us
and
a
possible
danger
of
large
claims
against
the
united
states
for
whatever
erosion,
the
unconstitutional
limits
might
have
occurred
in
the
interim.
if
the
final
transfer
provisions
of
this
act
are
later,
some
later
date,
held
unconstitutional
by
this
court.
now,
the
new
haven
trustee
argues
that
these
provisions
are
unconstitutional
on
numerous
grounds
of
which
i
have
time
to
take
up
only
three.
the
first
is
that,
the
act
requires
the
transfers
to
occur
before
the
adequacy
of
the
consideration
is
judicially
bad.
while
the
resources
provided
by
the
act
to
provide
the
consideration
and
their
view
maybe
inadequate
so
that
the
constitutional
minimum
may
never
be
received.
the
provision
for
a
transfer
first
and
the
for
judicial
evaluation
later
is
the
critical
genius
of
the
rail
act
in
our
view
because
in
that
way,
congress
broke
the
procedural
logjam
for
devising
and
approving
a
railroad
reorganization
plan
that
has
plague
the
icc
and
the
judiciary
for
decades.
some
--
a
procedure
that
took
so
much
time,
some
15
years
in
the
missouri
pacific
case
that
even
if
the
solution
could
be
evolved,
it
would
no
longer
be
relevant
to
the
problem
to
which
it
was
addressed.
but
by
this
method
of
transfer
first,
congress
made
it
possible
for
the
rail
entity
to
start
business
within
some
two
years
after
the
passage
of
the
act
for
the
railroad
estates
to
be
relieved
of
the
so
called
"erosion
burden"
of
providing
rail
service
at
that
time
and
for
the
time
consuming
process
of
adjudicating
evaluations
and
distributing
proceeds,
first
to
the
rail
estates,
and
then
among
the
various
creditor
classes
in
each
state
could
take
its
course
after
rather
than
before
the
new
entity
starts
business.
a
transfer
first
followed
by
evaluation
judicially
later
was
of
course
the
last
ditch
procedure
finally
adopted
by
judge
anderson
in
the
new
haven
cases.
and
no
one
found
constitutional
fault
in
that
procedure
since
inadequate
judicial
assurance
of
compensation
was
thought
to
be
available
from
penn
central.
here,
we
say
this
much
more
solid
assurance
in
the
rail
act
and
the
tucker
act.
if
the
special
court
cannot
itself
provide
the
constitutional
minimum
out
of
the
over
$2
billion
of
resources
that
are
provided
under
this
act,
inadequate
remedy
under
the
tucker
act
remains
available
for
the
reasons
given
by
the
solicitor
general
and
approved
by
judge
friendly
in
his
special
court
of
opinion.
now
the
new
haven
trustee,
unlike
his
co-plaintiff,
connecticut
general,
concedes
that
the
rail
act
did
not
bar
a
suit
under
the
tucker
act.
what
he
argues
is
that
under
the
youngstown
case,
the
steel
seizure
case,
a
tucker
act
suit
if
he
brought
one
or
the
rail
estate
brought
one
would
not
succeed
on
its
merits
because
the
statute
requiring
the
transfers,
the
rail
act
in
his
view
is
unconstitutional.
but
there
can't
be
any
doubt
that
those
required
transfers
first
are
precisely
what
congress
has
authorized.
and
if
the
right
to
sue
under
the
tucker
act
is
left
intact
by
the
rail
act
as
the
new
haven
trustee
concedes,
there
are
just
no
basis
for
calling
the
rail
act
itself
unconstitutional
and
the
transfers
that
it
requires
unauthorized.
youngstown
is
very
different
as
judge
friendly
points
out
at
page
102
of
his
opinion
because
there,
the
president
seizure
of
the
steel
plants
had
nothing
authorized
let
alone
commanded
by
the
congress.
the
new
haven
trustee
second
point
is
that
the
rail
act
is
not
a
valid
exercise
of
the
bankruptcy
power
but
it
is
a
condemnation
wolf
masquerading
in
bankruptcy
sheep's
clothing.
he
urges
that
the
so
called
"cram
down
power",
previously
upheld
by
this
court
under
section
77,
cannot
constitutionally
be
invoked
to
cram
down
on
all
creditor
classes
as
distinguished
from
only
one
or
two.
but
as
the
rock
allen
case
suggest
and
as
the
special
court
rule,
section
77
does
not
exhaust
the
limits
of
the
bankruptcy
power.and
there
doesn't
seemed
to
be
any
constitutional
reason
why
congress
cannot
cram
down
still
further,
if
it
deems
that
this
is
the
only
way
of
assuring
continued
rail
service
by
a
viable
private
firm
particularly
whereas
here
in
east,
viability
requires
the
consolidation
into
one
new
system
of
properties
from
several
bankrupt
railroads
each
with
their
own
myriad
classes
of
creditors.
so,
long
as
the
constitutional
minimum
consideration
is
assured,
rail
creditors
have
no
constitutional
right
merely
by
withholding
their
consent
to
a
plan
to
insist
on
condemnation
and
public
ownership
instead.
third,
the
new
haven
trustee
argues
that
congress
cannot
constitutionally
exercise
its
bankruptcy
in
commerce
powers
in
combination.
so,
as
to
require
rail
estates
to
accept
the
securities
of
the
reorganized
firm
as
part
of
this
fair
and
equitable
constitutional
minimum
and,
if
any
balance
is
required
to
accept
government
guaranteed
user
obligations,
which
are
provided
in
this
act
up
to
at
least
$500
million,
and
perhaps
more,
and
other
benefits
under
the
rail
act,
and
if
still
needed
a
claim
under
the
tucker
act
itself.
he
argues
that
if
there
is
any
possible
need
for
government
compensation,
then
the
entire
transaction
is
a
taking
of
property
for
public
use
and
entitles
the
rail
estates
to
payment
entirely
in
cash.
but
as
the
special
court
held,
the
constitution
we
say
does
not
bar
congress
from
exercising
its
powers
in
combination,
so
as
to
minimize
the
drain
in
the
federal
treasury.
section
77,
itself
is
an
exercise
of
both
the
bankruptcy
and
the
commerce
powers.
as
the
special
court
put
it,
congress
is
not
required
to
steer
the
ship
of
state
into
the
cellar
of
nationalization
for
cash
or
the
cribbed
these
of
a
rail
shutdown.
congress
can
steer
in
between,
if
a
viable
reorganized
entity
with
significant
earning
power
can
be
created.
there's
no
taking
of
property
for
public
use
to
the
extent
that
valuable
securities
of
the
new
entity
are
given
in
exchange
for
the
rail
properties
transfer.
after
fair
value
of
those
properties
is
judicially
determined
to
be
less
than
the
fair
value
of
the
securities
is
judicially
is
determined
to
be
less
than
the
fair
value
of
the
properties
transfer.
and
the
transfer
of
the
properties
is
still
congressionally
and
judicially
compelled,
then
there
maybe
a
taking
to
the
extent
of
the
shortfall,
but
only
to
that
extent.
at
this
point
of
course,
we
do
not
know
whether
there
will
be
a
shortfall,
but
if
one
is
judicially
determined,
congress
has
provided,
as
i
said,
at
least
$500
million
of
government
guaranteed
securities
for
direct
transfer
to
the
rail
estates
to
preserve
the
power
to
provide
more
and
it
is
going
to
review
this
final
system
plan
before
it
gets
to
court,
and
it
is
also
providing
other
benefits
under
the
act,
and
it
is
left,
we
say
the
tucker
act
remedy
available
for
any
balance.
i
should
take
a
moment
on
mr.
justice
douglas's
question
about
conrail
as
a
federal
instrumentality.
and
we
would
say
mr.
justice
douglas
that
it
is
not,
it
is
a
private
corporation
and
while
it
is
true
that
so
long
as
the
majority
of
its
debt
has
been
advanced
or
guaranteed
by
the
government.
that
a
majority
of
the
directors
maybe
named
by
the
president.
those
directors
will
have
the
same
duty
as
any
other
directors
to
all
of
the
shareholders,
namely
these
creditors
in
other
states
and
the
duty
to
make
a
profit.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
they
do
represent
loans
to
the
association
mr.
justice
white,
but
the
loans
are
within
the
discretion
of
use
wherein
the
congress
when
it
approves
the
plan
and
they
can
be
stock
subordinated
loans
far
behind
the
claims
of
these
creditors.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
they
would
presumably
have
to
be
at
least
slightly
superior
to
any
stock
that
issued.
but
of
course
conrail
is
not
confined
to
issuing
stock.
it
is
of
course
able
to
issue
debt
securities
which
can
be
handed
to
these
creditors
secured
by
williams
on
the
very
properties
on
which
they
now
--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
not
necessarily
sir,
because
the
obligations
of
user
federally
guaranteed
$500
million
of
them
can
be
turned
over
directly
to
the
rail
estates
of
course.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
there
would
be
debt
obligation
from
conrail
but
it
could
be
a
100-year
debt
at
2%
as
far
as
the
statute
goes.
moreover,
another
$500
billion
of
those
obligations
could
be
turned
over
to
conrail
for
direct
expenditure
by
conrail
to
approve
its
properties
in
a
way
that
would
enhance
the
value
of
the
entire
estate
and
finally,
a
third
$500
billion
--
million
could
be
used
to
enable
amtrak
to
buy
part
of
the
northeast
corner,
which
conrail
would
have
had
in
its
hands
and
conrail
would
receive
that
cash.
as
in
closing,
i
just
want
to
say
that
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
congress
can
combine
these
powers
to
reduce
the
drain
on
the
federal
treasury.
that's
what
congress
has
tried
to
do
in
order
to
make
payment
at
least
in
part
in
securities
of
the
reorganized
entity.
while
the
creditors
of
course,
are
trying
to
force
nationalization
in
which
case,
they
believe
although,
we
would
dispute
it
that
they
would
be
entitled
not
only
to
cash
but
to
some
higher
value
than
either
the
growing
concern
value
of
these
securities
or
liquidation
value
if
that's
more.
and
that's
why
you
find
the
government
parties
arguing
as
some
think
contrary
to
their
interest
that
this
statute
is
constitutional
because
the
tucker
act
remedy
is
available.
and
why
the
creditors
arguing,
obviously
contrary
to
their
interest
that
it
is
unconstitutional
because
no
tucker
act
remedy
is
available
for
them.
thank
you
very
much.
