mr.
louis
a.
craco
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
regret
the
necessity
of
disturbing
the
congenial
set
of
agreements
and
concessions
with
which
previous
counsel
had
approached
this
rostrum,
and
to
take
issue
with
virtually
all
counsel
who
have
appeared
before
me.
i
represent
the
appellant
and
the
appellees
in
connecticut
general,
secured
creditors
of
the
penn
central
transportation
corporation
and
we
appear
in
support
of
the
injunction
issued
below,
and
the
declaratory
relief
of
which
it
was
course
of
relief
declaring
the
act
in
significant
part
to
be
unconstitutional.
i
hope
in
by
taking
immediate
issue
with
the
notion
that
the
tasks
of
the
creditors
or
for
that
matter,
the
stockholders
represent
my
brother
mr.
berger
or
for
the
new
haven
trustee,
here
again,
represent
by
mr.
auerbach
is
to
force
a
nationalization
of
the
penn
central
transportation
company
or
to
impose
a
collision
with
either
seller
or
this.
it
is
our
task,
it
seems
to
me,
to
suggest
that
this
particular
remedy
fashioned
by
this
particular
congress,
for
this
particular
set
of
problems
represents
a
reach
in
excess
of
the
constitutional
grasp
of
the
congress
and
we
do
not
mean
to
suggest
that
a
proper
solution
to
these
problems
is
beyond
the
width
or
wisdom
of
the
national
legislature.
the
root
position
that
we
take
and
i
take
it
that
this
now
is
conceded
to
be
the
issue
is
that
if
the
tucker
act
be
not
available,
the
rail
act
is
unconstitutional
and
that
it
furnishes
no
assurance
that
the
bankruptcy
estates
will
receive
fair
compensation,
either
for
the
rail
properties
ultimately
conveyed
or
for
the
interim
erosion
sustained
until
such
conveyance.
we
argue
that
the
tucker
act
is
not
available
on
a
fair
reading
of
the
statute
and
that
the
rail
act
in
this
respect
was
properly
enjoined
below.
let
me
take
up
initially
the
preposition
raised
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
as
to
whether
all
these
troublesome
and
questions
need
to
be
reached
now
or
whether
sufficient
to
the
days
the
eagle
there
up.
we
submit
that
these
questions
are
right
now
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
for
a
number
of
reasons
that
i
would
like
to
touch
on
quickly
and
likely.
first
of
all,
as
other
counsel
in
particular
the
solicitor
general
has
observed,
the
act
is
enforced
now
and
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
contingent
about
the
inexorable
operations
of
the
act
between
now
and
the
date
of
conveyance.
secondly,
notwithstanding
the
provisions
of
section
303
with
regard
to
ultimate
compensation,
erosion
in
the
interim
will
be
sustained
and
that
is
occurring
now.
the
court
below
found
it
likely
that
those
--
that
that
interim
erosion
would
arise
to
the
level
of
unconstitutionality
during
that
interim
period
and
the
protection
that
we
require
and
the
assurance
that
we
require
for
compensation
as
to
those
matters
it
seems
to
us
matures
daily.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
by
itself,
it
might
not.
we
take
it
together,
however,
with
the
contention
made
here
that
the
ultimate
conveyance
and
compensation
mechanisms
are
sufficient
onto
themselves
to
compensate
for
the
erosion
which
is
being
endured.
and
if
they
are
not,
then
the
impact
of
the
interim
erosion
argues
for
consideration
of
adequacy
of
compensate
or
mechanism
now.
furthermore
however,
under
section
209
of
the
act
and
under
section
303
(b)
(2)
of
the
act
the
last
sentence,
the
act
specifically
excludes
future
review
of
the
compensatory
mechanisms
by
injunctive
procedures,
so
that
the
remedy
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
suggested
as
possibly
being
available
on
some
future
date,
is
attempted
to
be
precluded
by
those
provisions
of
the
act.
and
most
particularly
the
special
court
is
given
no
discretion
under
the
act
but
to
orders
the
conveyances
upon
the
certification
of
the
final
system
plan.
if
there
are
any
doubts
about
the
statutory
intent
from
that,
the
senate
reported
at
page
33,
it
says
it,
one
little
word
after
the
other
that
the
special
court
is
given
no
discretion
to
withhold
those
conveyances.
the
fifth
point,
i
would
make
on
the
question
of
rightness
mr.
rehnquist
is
that,
all
of
the
objectionable
features
to
which
all
allude
in
a
moment
of
the
act
are
no
mean
knowable
now
and
nothing
implicit
in
the
passage
of
time
or
what
might
transpire
during
the
passage
of
time,
can
change
the
legal
characteristics
of
those
features
of
the
act.
and
finally,
we
would
content
that
and
this
is
close
to
the
heart
of
our
case
that,
the
constitutional
vice
of
the
act,
is
that
it
imposes
upon
the
private
sector,
the
creditors,
the
stockholders,
the
unsecured
creditors,
the
entire
risk
of
the
success
or
failure
of
this
operation
during
the
interim.
the
entire
risk
of
loses
in
the
interim,
the
entire
risk
of
in
adequacy
of
compensation
in
the
end,
the
entire
risk
of
the
difficulties
of
obtaining
a
final
system
plan
that
can
work,
the
entire
risk
of
conjec
--
congressional
rejection
or
in
pass,
and
it
is
our
preposition
that
when
our
property,
for
the
property
of
the
estate
in
which
we
have
claims
is
requisition
in
the
public
interest
for
a
continued
or
final
operation
for
a
public
purpose.
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
to
impose
those
risks
upon
us
without
just
compensation
and
all
those
risks
are
discernable
now,
though,
absence
of
assurance
is
discernable
now
and
we
think,
the
issue
which
that
risks
presents
is
right
now.
i've
said
that
the
act
precludes
assurance
of
fair
value
and
i
would
like
to
tell
the
court
that
i've
post
to
address
two
issues.
first,
touching
lightly
in
the
light
of
the
solicitor
general's
concession
on
why
we
believe
the
act
is
constitutionally
vicious
in
the
absence
of
a
tucker
act
remedy
and
then
touching
somewhat
or
heavily
i
hope,
on
the
question
of
whether
the
tucker
act
is
there
to
rescue
the
act.
i
say,
i'll
touch
lightly
on
these
questions
recognizing
the
possibility
that
mr.
justice
stewart
raised
that
the
act
could
be
conceivably
considered
by
this
court.
sustainable
in
the
absence
of
the
tucker
act
because
i
think
the
solicitor
general's
argument
on
the
point
as
a
quasi
appellee
for
the
moment
was
persuasive
and
perhaps,
sufficient
to
the
occasion.
that
in
the
absence
of
the
tucker
act
the
show
is
substantially
over.
but
let
me
touch
on
four
characteristics
of
the
act
that
it
seems
to
me
condemn
it
as
a
constitutional
enactment.
first,
there
are
no
provisions
in
the
act.
i
mean,
literally
none
at
all.
that
provide
for
a
payment
of
the
interim
erosion
sustained
by
the
estates
until
such
time
as
the
conveyances
occur.
and
we
submit
that
that
imposes
upon
the
estates
both
the
risk
and
indeed
a
very
likely
certainty
of
unconstitutional
erosion
on
the
estate
and
of
the
claims
against
the
estate
as
their
interest
might
appear.
the
second
consideration
and
i
think
this
is
--
it's
important
to
frame
this
in
terms
of
the
about
intention,
to
frame
this
act
like
unto
the
new
haven
inclusion
prospect.
the
second
consideration
in
that
context
is
that,
there
are
no
provisions
in
the
act.
again,
literally
none,
which
create
what
the
new
haven
inclusion
case
characterized
as
an
intrinsic
value
for
the
conrail
stock.
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
case,
judge
anderson
had
after
negotiations
endorsed
in
$87.50
per
share
value
for
the
stock
in
the
penn
central,
nothing
establishes
such
value
here.
we'll
be
gone
though
that
assurance
was
there.
we
have
in
this
situation
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
with
regard
to
the
liquidation
values
of
the
penn
central
estate
and
we
have
maximum
obligation
or
authorities
which
fall
measurably
short
of
that
amount.
and
so,
we
are
left
with
consideration
in
the
form
of
a
package
of
securities
as
to
which
as
i
say,
there
is
no
intrinsic
value
supplied
by
the
act.
the
third
feature
and
this
i
take
it
to
be
conceded
as
a
constitutionally
impermissible
feature
of
the
act
in
the
absence
of
the
tucker
act
on
page
39
of
the
federal
appellee
brief
is
that,
there
is
no
traditional
determination
of
the
fairness
and
equitableness
of
the
consideration
prior
to
the
irrevocable
execution
of
the
conveyances.
as
i
say
to
the
solicitor
general,
has
conceded
that
that
constitutional
entitled
and
exists.
the
special
court
has
rejected
the
invitation
of
the
solicitor
general
to
extract
such
an
opportunity
in
the
short
time
between
certification
of
the
final
system
plan
and
the
maturing
of
its
obligation
to
convey.
and
that's
the
special
court's
opinion
on
page
68.
not
only
does
this
absence
of
an
opportunity
to
determine
an
advance,
whether
the
consideration
is
going
to
be
fair
and
equitable
to
the
estates.
constitute
in
itself,
constitutionally
impermissible
feature
of
the
act.
but
i
think,
it
radically
distinguishes
this
case
from
all
the
cram
down
presidents.
most
particularly
the
rio
grand
case
and
the
visitation
on
the
cram
down
provision
which
i
happen
to
think
is
best
laid
out
in
mr.
justice
douglas'
dissent
in
the
sancho
paper
case.
the
heart
and
soul
of
the
cram
down
provision
is
that
prior
to
the
imposition
of
a
plan
of
reorganization
upon
dissenting
interest
of
shareholders.
the
court
upon
its
informed
discretion
with
the
aid
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
shall
determine
that
the
plan
is
fair
and
equitable.
that
is
shall
determine
that
consideration
at
a
time
when
it
has
the
power
to
do
something
about
it.
and
the
vice
of
this
act
and
the
distinction
from
all
prior
considerations
of
cram
down
is
that,
there
is
no
judicial
intervention
to
ensure
that
result.
and
finally
and
favorably,
there
is
no
underwriting
provision
in
this
act.
the
new
haven
plan
as
you
will
all
undoubtedly
recall
included
a
deep
pocket
in
which
the
penn
central
had
undertaken
to
make
good
any
excess
of
value
that
might
judicially
be
found
in
excess
of
the
intrinsic
value
of
the
stock
or
the
marketable
value
of
the
stock
at
the
time
that
the
stock
was
received.
and
at
399
u.s.
particularly
at
pages
486
and
following,
the
opinion
of
the
court,
lays
heavy
emphasis
on
the
importance
of
that
underwriting
provision.
what
that
meant
was
it
they're
stood
behind
the
commitment
of
the
plan
that
was
presented
to
you,
and
irrevocable
contractual
commitment,
to
make
good
on
any
consideration
that
might
be
required
in
excess
of
that
provided
by
the
immediate
features
of
the
plan.
and
it
is
our
position
that
that
underwriting
provision
is
utterly
absent,
deliberately
absent,
from
this
act.
section
303
(c)
which
is
the
compensatory
provision
of
the
act
provides
the
exhaustion
of
the
constitutional
minimum
of
one's
rights
in
a
deficiency
judgment
against
conrail,
the
point
that
i
will
come
back
to
in
my
discussion
with
tucker
act.
but
most
particularly,
the
conference
report
which
is
set
out
in
the
legislative
materials
furnished
to
you
by
the
solicitor
general.
at
page
56,
it
makes
clear
of
an
--
any
further
clarity
were
necessary
from
the
statutory
language
that
the
provisions
of
the
act
with
respect
to
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
securities
issue.
"shall
not
include
any
form
of
federal
guarantee
of
the
value
of
the
corporation
stock."
in
other
words,
the
underwriting
provision
which
this
court
found
to
be
essential
to
the
survival
of
the
new
haven
plan
is
explicitly
precluded
by
the
conference
report
and
fairly
excluded
by
the
statutory
scheme
here.
so,
those
positions
taken
separately
and
most
particularly
those
positions
taken
in
the
aggregate,
lead
us
to
the
conclusion
that
this
act
is
valid
over
the
fifth
amendment.
i
speak
now,
not
of
the
questions
of
uniformity.
i'm
not
going
to
address
myself
to
the
questions
of
due
process.
it
seems
to
me
that
those
have
been
adequately
briefed
over
or
will
be
dealt
by
my
brother.
but
the
point
of
the
fundamental
on
fairness
of
the
act
in
acquiring
private
property
or
a
public
purpose
without,
and
a
short
compensation
upon
the
hypothetical
allegation
that
attracts
the
experience
of
the
new
haven.
it's
simply
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
wrong
as
a
matter
of
history.
now
that
underwriting,
which
the
statute
does
not
in
terms
provide
and
the
constitutional
deficiency
which
the
act
does
suffers
is
sought
to
be
repaired
here
by
the
introduction
into
the
mix
of
the
tucker
act.
the
reason
why
the
solicitor
general
and
the
trustee
of
the
penn
central,
both
acknowledge
to
you
quite
candidly
i
think,
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
in
the
absence
of
the
tucker
act
is
because
they
recognized
the
necessity
for
that
character
of
underwriting
which
the
new
haven
found
essential,
and
which
the
act
does
not
appear
to
provide.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
no
--
mr.
louis
a.
craco
i
think
to
these
purposes
of
they
are
the
same.
the
position
that
you
took
in
that
case,
dealt
with
the
fairness
and
equitableness
of
the
plan
in
the
77
since
because
it
was
in
entirely
voluntary
arrangement.
we
say
that
the
same
standards
at
minimum
applied
to
a
situation,
where
there
is
no
voluntary
character
to
the
arrangement
but
where
it's
entirely
in
an
exact
of
statute.
nobody
has
negotiated
the
terms
of
section
303
(c),
they
are
there.
but
i
think
the
constitutional
obligation
of
fairness
is
at
least
as
owners
in
this
case,
as
the
fairness
and
equitable
i
suppose
it
was
found
there.
as
your
opinion
indicated
in
that
court,
at
page
488,
it
would
be
unfair
to
require
the
conveyance
of
the
new
haven
assets
for
what
might
turn
out
to
be
a
fraction
and
their
worth.
and
that
on
fairness,
we
think
it's
the
heart
of
the
political
ethic
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
is
applicable
here.
when
we
say,
when
we
talk
about
the
availability
of
the
tucker
act,
it
seems
to
me
we're
in
parallel
of
a
certain
ambiguity
and
i
want
to
try
before
recess
to
indicate,
what
we
think
that
ambiguity
might
be
and
the
nature
of
the
analysis
that,
i
will
hopefully
address
after
lunch.
there
are
two
aspects
to
the
availability
on
the
tucker
act.
the
first
is,
its
legal
availability
as
a
substitute
for
assurances
lacking
under
the
act.
a
true
constitutional
panacea
as
the
solicitor
general
would
set.
and
the
second
question
arising
under
the
rule
of
the
availability
of
the
tucker
act
is
whether
as
a
matter
of
law
of
remedy,
it
is
available
as
an
adequate
remedy
of
law
sufficient
to
have
required
the
court
below
to
stay
its
hand
from
injunctive
relief.
and
that
raises
some
different
considerations
from
the
issue
of
pure
or
legal
availability.
it
will
be
my
contention
when
we
return
and
i'd
say
that
we're
about
to
leave,
that
the
availability
of
the
tucker
act
is
a
femoral
on
both
considerations.
that
the
remedial
structures
of
section
303
of
the
act,
do
not
impliedly
repeal
the
tucker
act.
they
simply
displaced
the
tucker
act
in
regard
to
the
circumstances.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
preemption
sort
of
the
--
we
can
get
into
a
semantic
this
course
here
but
i
think
that
there's
a
difference
between
repealer
which
is
not
likely
to
be
implied,
which
is
not
to
be
implied
and
to
strike
down
in
act
on
a
one
handn
and
a
preclusive
effect
of
an
exhaustive
and
complete
remedial
section
which
while
not
repeal
in
a
tucker
act.
it
simply
exhaust
the
remedies
of
the
tucker
act
would
not
--
will
otherwise
be
available
for.
we
think
as
i
say,
the
section
303
is
so
complete
on
its
terms
and
so
utterly
consistent
with
the
purpose
and
policy
of
the
act
that
it
be
complete
on
its
term
that
the
tucker
act
is
not
fairly
understood
to
be
available
here
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
i
don't
think
it
was
true
in
the
same
sense
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
that
case,
there
were
radical
distinctions
which
i
oppose
to
address,
both
the
flooding
case,
the
lynch
case
and
hurley
--
mr.
louis
a.
craco
then,
you
have
to
reach
the
second
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
punitive
existence
of
a
tucker
act
remedy
here
provides
a
remedy
which
is
sufficiently
certain
and
clear
as
to
have
required
abstention
from
the
injunction
below.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
i
will.
thank
you.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
i
think
i
have
about
10
minutes
in
modest
encroaching
rights
on
my
brother.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
dealing
with
the
tucker
act,
let
me
go
directly
to
the
cases
in
which
our
adversaries
find
solace,
are
hurley
and
lynch.
i'll
touch
on
them
briefly
because
i
think
in
the
distinction
between
those
two
cases
which
i
think
is
a
cardinal
distinction,
lies
a
material
inside
into
the
character
of
this
case.
first
of
all,
let
me
say
that
i
would
like
to
rely
on
the
area
addition
and
the
analysis
of
judge
friendly
in
the
special
courts
opinion
beginning
at
about
page
94
and
footnote
101
on
the
hurley
case.
plainly,
that
is
the
case
in
which
congress
evidenced
an
indisposition
to
be
beset
by
damages
for
consequential
liability
for
consequential
damages,
arising
from
floods
incident
to
a
flood
control
program.
it
said
nothing
of
the
question
of
what
remedy
it
would
or
would
not
afford
for
taking
if
in
fact
the
taking
occurred.
and
the
court
goes
no
further
than
to
say,
that
upon
the
discovery
of
an
actual
taking
of
the
--
by
the
way
in
this
position
of
the
court
to
entertain
of
the
congress
--
to
entertain
claims
for
consequential
flood
damage
is
not
meant
to
cut
off
recourse
to
the
courts
under
the
tucker
act
for
clear
and
present
taking.
in
common
with
the
lynch
case
and
this
is
the
key,
it
seems
to
made
distinction
between
those
cases
and
this.
in
common
with
the
lynch
case,
hurley
had
no
provision
in
the
act
with
respect
to
remedial
characteristics
of
the
statutory
scheme.
the
solicitor
general
quoted
to
your
language
which
i
think
is
at
the
heart
of
the
matter
in
--
from
lynch,
its
at
292
u.s.586
and
their,
the
court
in
identifying
why
the
abrogation
constitutional
or
not
of
contractually
rights
did
not
infer
an
abrogation
of
the
remedies,
said
this,
"there
is
no
separate
provision
in
section
17
referring
to
the
economy
act,
dealing
with
the
remedy."
now,
those
cases
--
mr.
louis
a.
craco
that's
the
insurance
case.
now
both
of
those
cases,
it
seems
to
me,
proceed
in
the
absence
of
a
remedial
provision.
this
case
proceeds
in
the
presence
of
an
exhausted
remedial
provision
and
that
is
the
distinction
that
i
want
to
emphasize.
it
brings
me
to
the
first
of
the
two
twin
arguments
that
i
indicated
that
i
would
make
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
tucker
act
is
not
available
here
because
there
are
remedial
mechanisms
provided
for
in
section
303
(c)
of
the
act
which
are
on
their
phase
and
by
any
fair
construction
in
the
interplay
of
sections,
preclusive
of
recourse
to
any
other
remedy.
the
remedies
provided
by
section
303
(c)
are
supposed
to
provide
the
estates
with
everything
that
they
are
entitled
to
get.
the
statutory
languages
that
they
are
to
provide
for
the
recovery
of
the
constitutional
minimum,
which
i
take
it
to
be
stingy,
rather
it
for
that
which
just
compensation
required.
they
command
further
and
this
is
of
importance,
regurgitation
by
the
estates
of
any
excess
over
of
the
minimum
constitutional
value.
their
exclusivity
is
hedged
about
by
two
other
provisions
of
the
act,
section
209
of
the
act
which
prevents
any
injunctive
recourse
by
any
other
court
and
section
303
(b)
(2),
which
provides
that
no
other
court
may
enjoin
the
conveyances.
so,
that
this
court
that
is
the
special
court,
is
invested
with
the
entire
scope
of
remediation
under
the
act.
and
that
remediation
is
made
by
the
terms
of
the
act,
coextensive
with
the
constitutional
entitlement
of
the
estates.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
contemplated
by
the
remedial
provisions
of
the
act
that
they'll
be
anything
left
over
to
which
in
a
state
might
be
entitled
that
it
could
go
any
place
else
to
recover
and
the
catch
all
the
bag,
at
the
end
of
the
remediation
provision,
a
place
where
you
get
everything
that
you're
entitled
to
if
you
don't
get
it
from
the
stock,
if
you
don't
get
it
from
the
user
bonds,
is
a
deficiency
judgment
against
conrail,
and
no
where
else.
as
i
indicated
to
you
this
morning,
the
language
of
the
statute
which
turns
you
face
towards
conrail
for
the
full
remediation
of
your
rights
is
buttress
by
the
language
of
the
conference
committee
report
which
indicated
in
as
many
words,
that
there
was
to
be
no
federal
guarantee
of
the
value
of
the
stock
and
precludes
by
inference
that
which
the
statute
precludes
in
terms.
this
arises
from
no
elaborate
cannon
of
construction.
this
arises
from
a
fair
reading
of
the
statutory
terms
and
the
interplay
of
the
statutory
structure
itself.
and
we
suggest
that
the
recourse
to
the
cannons
of
construction
advanced
to
you
by
the
solicitor
general
today
is
designed
to
avoid
the
plain
meaning
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
and
to
--
rather
than
to
elucidate
an
obscure
meaning.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
i
think
it
would
have
and
obviously
this
issue
would
not
be
here
if
they
had
done
so.
justice
frankfurter
indicated
that
statutory
interpretations
tend
to
come
to
this
court
with
some
patent
on
both
sides
to
the
question.
but
we
think
that
they
did
not
for
one
clear
reason.
they
didn't
think
of
the
issue
in
those
terms.
they
were
trying
to
construct
a
reorganization
statute
and
it
is
not
the
common
learning
of
reorganization
cases
that
you
look
to
the
tucker
act
for
your
ultimate
recourse.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
i
think
that's
very
likely
so
in
and
for
two
reasons.
if
you
looked
at
what
they
did
do,
they
were
talking
the
language
or
reorganization.
and
they
were
talking
it
in
the
context
of
warnings
from
the
secretary
of
transportation
that
if
they
started
talking
about
takings,
they
might
very
well
run
into
an
interpretation
in
this
court
or
some
other
that
they
had
in
fact
affected
in
a
domain
statute.
so,
i
think
they
saw
assiduously
discipline
themselves
to
the
language
of
reorganization
and
so
carefully
tried
to
track
the
experience
of
the
new
haven,
that
they
avoided
any
of
the
redirect
that
might
have
implied
in
any
way,
that
a
right
might
us
accrue
under
the
tucker
act
from
which
they
were
precluding
a
remedy.
i
think
that's
the
only
fair
construction
of
the
purpose
and
policy
of
the
act
taken
at
large,
part
from
the
provisions
of
the
act
themselves.
if
you
look
at
section
101,
sub
6
of
the
act,
it's
the
last
of
the
purpose
on
provisions
of
the
act
and
it's
very
clear.
what
they
said
about
to
do
and
let's
be
heard
clear
about
this
because
it
governs
both
arguments
i
have.
what
they
said
about
to
do,
was
to
try
to
find
out
whether
they
could
effect
a
rescue
of
the
northeast
rail
system
by
a
modest
investment
of
federal
funds
at
the
least
cost
to
the
taxpayer,
with
the
language
that
they
use.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
what
they
did
in
fact
was
ratio
the
amount
of
funds
that
were
to
be
available.
that's
instinct
in
the
legislative
--
mr.
louis
a.
craco
the
tucker
act
is
still
there
unless
they
precluded
its
application
by
another
remedial
statute
which
they
did
in
fact
enact
and
it's
our
position
that
they
did
that
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
that's
right,
different
and
exhausted.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
it's
different,
it's
exclusive,
and
it's
exhausted.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
the
inference
from
the
language
of
section
303
(c)
that
says
that
if
the
provisions
of
the
act
do
not
provide
the
constitutional
minimum
to
the
estates,
then,
the
court
shall
enter
a
deficiency
judgment
against
conrail.
now,
the
constitutional
minimum
is
presumably
the
content
of
the
cause
of
action
you
haven't
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
i
think
it's?
i
think
they
intended
and
did
turn
you
away
from
other
provisions
of
congress
that
would
provide
a
remedy
in
the
absence
of
the
remedial
legislation
that
they
enacted
here
and
told
the
estates
to
have
their
complete
constitutional
--
mr.
louis
a.
craco
on
conrail.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
in
effect,
yes.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
because
as
i
said
before
--
mr.
louis
a.
craco
i
don't
think
that
they
were
talking
language
of
condemnation
at
all.
and
they
were
talking
language
of
reorganization
and
in
so
talking,
did
not
mention
the
tucker
act.
the
things
that
they
did
mention
by
the
way,
the
other
repealers
that
they
have,
are
all
directly
related
to
the
implementation
of
the
final
system
plan.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
remedial
features
of
the
act
at
all.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
the
question
of
adequacy
as
well
as
availability
and
if
i
may
turn
--
mr.
louis
a.
craco
that's
--
that
gets
me
to
adequacy
right
away.
the
simple
answer
to
that
your
honor
is
that,
the
practical
consideration
underlying
this
entire
discussion
of
the
availability
of
the
tucker
act
has
a
surreal
quality
about
it
because
you
get
to
the
deficiency
judgment
under
the
tucker
act.
only
if
your
deficiency
judgment
against
conrail
has
been
exhausted
and
returned
unsatisfied.
the
hypothesis,
which
necessarily
assumed
that
the
security
packages
that
you've
been
afforded
prior
to
that
time,
have
been
exhausted
and
are
substantially
without
value.
the
notion
by
the
tucker
act
remedy
arises
at
all
for
a
sliver
of
value
on
top
of
a
package
of
given
values
be
lies
the
fact
that
it
arises
as
it
deficiency
at
all,
only
when
conrail
can't
respond
to
it's
own
judgment.
and
if
that
juncture
i
suggest
to
you
you're
into
a
situation,
where
the
conrail
situation
has
collapsed.
this
remedy
--
mr.
louis
a.
craco
yes,
it
is.
mr.
louis
a.
craco
because
at
that
point,
the
stock
will
be
without
value
of
conrail
can't
respond
to
a
judgment
for
no
more
than
the
asset
value
of
its
operating
assets.
the
bonds
which
are
secured
by
its
assets
will
not
be
a
substantial
value
and
if
that
point
the
deficiency
which
will
ensue
will
be
greater
than
the
--
than
any
hypothetical
difference
between
the
existing
value
and
what
the
special
court
awards.
the
point
is,
that
much
more
are
likely
in
any
real
world
than
a
tucker
act
remedy
in
the
court
of
claims
is
at
conrail
section
77
and
going
to
the
question
of
whether
the
tucker
act
remedy
can
ever
be
adequate.
it
assumes
an
acquiescence
of
protracted
acquiescence
by
the
congress
in
the
ongoing
process
of
this
act,
at
a
time
when
they've
indicated
that
they
want
their
investment
to
be
limited
and
that
protracted
acquiescence
i
suggest
to
you,
they
have
advanced
no
disposition
to
entertain.
we
think
that
the
act
on
the
tucker
act
is
not
a
plain
remedy.
it's
not
a
certain
remedy.
it
doesn't
even
get
reached
until
after
all
the
processes
of
the
rail
act
are
exhausted
and
until
conrail
has
collapsed.
and
those
we
say,
in
addition
to
the
reasons
why
under
the
structure
of
the
act,
the
remedies
are
unavailable
at
all.
make
the
putative
remedy
in
adequate
as
a
matter
of
the
law
of
remedies.
and
on
those
grounds
perhaps
surprisingly,
we
suggest
that
it
is
unavailable
and
argued
at
the
court
below
quite
properly
rejected
its
availability,
thank
you.
