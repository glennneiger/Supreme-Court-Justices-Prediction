mr.
brockman
adams
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
the
reason
that
i
am
here
this
morning
is
that
the
primary
intent
of
this
statute
was
contrary
to
some
of
the
statements
of
government
counsel,
not
ever
to
be
a
taking.
the
properties
are
never
taken
from
the
individuals.
but
instead,
we
have
tried
logically
to
extend
the
powers
of
the
reorganization
statute
is
set
forth
and
interpreted
by
this
court
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
cases.
the
whole
history
of
this
statute
was
for
us
to
try
to
create
a
buyer
where
none
existed.
make
an
offer
to
these
reorganization
courts,
give
all
of
the
stock
in
exchange
for
the
assets
that
are
transferred.
so,
that
the
original
creditors
are
crammed
down,
yes.
but
they
receive
full
interest
in
this
corporation,
plus
$2
billion
worth
of
government
advantages.
and
when
they
are
finished
with
this
and
the
court
values
at
some
later
time.
if
there
has
been
a
mistake
in
the
manner
in
which
the
process
operated,
then
these
parties
can
sue
as
justice
white
was
asking
in
his
question,
"is
there
a
right
to
sue
for
some
failure,
maybe
we
hold
the
party
too
long,"
then,
they
could.
but
the
two
primary
issues
are
these.
how
long
can
hold
these
parties?
that
was
what
concerned
the
lower
court
in
this
case.
we
think
they
can
be
held
during
this
limited
period
of
time.
and
if
they
can
be
held
during
that
period
of
time
and
you
adjust
what
they
received
in
terms
of
stock
or
you
set
a
different
date
for
transfer.
then,
their
erosion
problems
are
taken
care
off
in
that
fashion.
the
second
problem
however
and
the
one
we
are
concerned
about
with
the
so
called
"tucker
act
argument,"
which
i
think
is
a
rehearing
is
whether
or
not
this
statute
in
its
process
provides
for
a
deficiency
judgment
against
the
united
states.
and
our
problem
very
simply
in
congress
and
it
is
stated
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix
and
it
runs
through
all
of
the
other
briefs.
this
was
discussed
great
length
in
congress
and
the
congress
wanted
to
go
only
so
far
in
granting
funds
to
reorganize
this
process,
and
they
did
that.
now,
as
far
as
the
cost
the
case
is
concerned,
hurley
versus
kincaid
and
the
other
tucker
act
cases,
we
did
not
try
to
repeal
the
fifth
amendment
or
certainly
repeal
the
tucker
act
jurisdictional
statement.
that
issue
will
depend
upon
the
facts
after
this
process
is
over
whether
an
individual
party
has
been
injured
by
a
lawful
act
of
the
united
states.
but
the
key
issue
before
the
court
this
morning
is,
"is
this
process
lawful?"
can
we
use
the
reorganization
process?
can
we
under
the
logical
extension
of
this
court's
ruling
in
the
denver
rio
grand
case
and
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
cases
go
through
this
process
with
this
people?
we
think
that
the
congress
did
this
properly
and
we
hope
this
court
will
hold
that
the
statute
--
its
process
is
constitutional,
that
the
cram
down
of
stock
for
assets
is
valid.
mr.
brockman
adams
i
think
you
should
that
if
the
tucker
act
requires
a
deficiency
judgment
as
part
of
this
process
to
make
it
constitutional.
then,
we
have
reached
the
tucker
act
and
this
act
does
not
provide
that.
if
you
decide
however,
that
there
maybe
some
place
down
the
line
and
the
lawful
process
a
mistake,
then
you
reach
and
say,
the
tucker
act
case
will
have
to
be
decided,
when
and
if
some
party
can
decide
that
they
have
created
a
case
on
the
merits.
now,
that
decision
is
what
we
consider
--
mr.
brockman
adams
oh,
yes.
let
us
say
for
example
that
after
this
is
all
over
and
this
is
the
three-judge
court's
problem.
that
if
a
party
comes
in
and
says,
"you
held
us
beyond
the
constitutional
limit
on
erosion
and
at
that
point,
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
it
went
just
too
long,
it
was
unreasonable."
but
that
is
a
specific
individual
case
at
that
point.
mr.
brockman
adams
and
of
course,
we
did
not
repeal
the
matter.
i
thank
the
court.
