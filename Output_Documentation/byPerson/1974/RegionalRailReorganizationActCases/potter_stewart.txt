although,
you
the
federal
parties
did
appeal
that,
didn't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
let
say,
what's
--
why
was
the
point
of
that
provision
of
the
statute
making
that
providing
for
dismissal
of
the
77?
justice
potter
stewart
its
kind
of
--
kind
of
a
non-secretor
or
something
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
one
wonders
about
is
its
purposes,
is
there
any
legislative
history
showing
what
the
reasons
wants
to
do
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
means
that
you
in
effect
concede
constitutional
invalidity
of
the
statute
and
the
absence
of
that
remedy?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
absence
of
the
tucker
act
remedy
in
the
event
of
such
unconstitutional
taking
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean,
what?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
hear
what
you
just
said.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
did
not
catch
your
word.
justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
potter
stewart
but
again,
we
can't
on
appeal,
we
couldn't
appropriate
money.
justice
potter
stewart
my
brother
rehnquist
question
really
should
be
a
--
to
be
an
analog,
i
should
suppose
a
legislation
passed
by
congress
that
would
definitely
appropriate
certain
property
and
say
that
the
payment
for
this
property
will
be
ex-shares
of
conrail
stock
and
that
there
will
be
no
tucker
act
remedy,
no
other
thing
given
for
the
property
and
that
is
the
analog
that
you
have
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
also
conceivable
of
course,
that
the
court
could
hold
the
act
as
not
constitutional
despite
a
tucker
act
remedy.
i
mean,
there
are
other
attacks
constitutionality's
--
justice
potter
stewart
come
down
and
a
--
the
payment
in
securities
rather
than
cash
and
all
sorts
of
it,
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
really
make
all
that
difference
there
would
be
an
equity
receivership
i
guess
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
wouldnt
be
deprived
of
that.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
agree
that
if
the
constitutionality
of
these
pro
--
the
provisions
of
the
act
now
at
issue
are
upheld
in
this
litigation
and
in
view
of
what
the
special
court
has
done,
then
this
point
wouldn't
arise.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
found
essential
on
the
context
of
other
not
it
was
fair
and
equitable
plan
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
whether
or
not
it
was
constitutional.
is
there
a
difference
in
the
test?
justice
potter
stewart
one
higher
and
one
lower
or
are
they
equivalent?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
true
in
the
flooding
case
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
the
insurance
case?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
can
promise
you,
i
didn't
write
the
opinion
that
they
