justice
william
o.
douglas
there
is
nothing
here
from
that
special
court?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
it
cannot
be
on
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
another
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
this
change
in
position
and
traceable
for
the
fact
that
this
is
a
corporation
as
a
federal
instrumentally?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
your
judgment?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
do
you
agree
that
with
the
three-judge
court
that
the
question
of
whether
the
transfer
of
the
properties
as
such
was
a
taking
that
is
not
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
the
act,
the
lien
doesn't
follow
up
proceeds?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
mean,
the
new
act?
