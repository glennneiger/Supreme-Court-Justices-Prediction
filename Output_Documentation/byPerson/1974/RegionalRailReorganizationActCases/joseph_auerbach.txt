mr.
joseph
auerbach
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
is
fallen
into
my
lap
among
my
brother
to
discuss
with
the
court
questions
of
the
significant
of
the
new
haven
inclusion
cases
as
they
bear
upon
the
issues
here
and
the
cause
of
appeal
which
the
haven
trustee
took
in
this
matter,
with
respect
to
the
affect
of
the
ultimate
conveyances
required
by
the
act
which
the
law
of
court
considered
premature
before
addressing
myself
to
those
two
points,
however,
i
would
like
to
mention
briefly
as
a
matter
which
is
a
reason
during
this
course
of
the
day,
as
to
which
i
think
the
court
would
want
to
be
advised.
first,
the
question
was
asked
whether
the
opinion
of
the
special
court
was
appealable
and
could
come
before
this
court.
as
we
stated
in
our
replied
brief
here
at
page
48,
"we
intend
to
file
with
the
court
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
will
be
very
shortly,
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
under
the
ulrich
pact."
we
hope
to
raise
some
of
the
questions.
we
think
the
special
court
did
deal
with
certain
matters
in
the
unconstitutional
way.
now
obviously,
the
decision
of
the
court
here
and
the
issues
now
before
it
might
move
out
entirely.
but
the
fact
is
we
do
intend
to
file
and
raise
those
issues
with
this
court
notwithstanding
the
last
sentence
of
section
207
(b).
another
question
was
asked
this
morning
replies
comment.
the
question
was,
whether
dismissal
of
the
reorganization
is
a
possibility.
the
new
haven
trustee
filed
a
petition
and
motion
under
section
77
(g),
which
is
the
prescribed
method
under
the
rail
reorganization
statute.
for
dismissal
of
the
reorganization
and
for
the
part
of
the
penn
central
trustee's
as
receivers
on
october
9,
1973
something
over
a
year
ago.
that
motion
and
petition
were
not
heard
until
may
1974.
they
were
reheard
again
by
judge
fullam
in
september
of
this
year
but
before
and
he
has
not
yet
active
but
it
can't
act
now
because
the
special
court
has
enjoined
a
dismissal.
another
ground
for
a
petition
of
certiorari.
the
third
point
which
i
would
like
to
refer
of
this
nature
is
a
question
with
respect
to
section
207
(b)
by
one
of
the
justices
this
morning
to
which
the
solicitor
general
replied,
i
think
section
207
(b)
is
effectively
behind
us.
the
fact
is,
the
new
haven
trustee
now
has
pending
in
the
third
circuit,
appeals
from
both
the
120-day
findings
and
the
180-day
findings
headed
by
judge
fullam
which
have
the
triggering
sections
for
the
action
by
the
special
court.
in
which,
we
argued
that
an
article
three
courts
such
as
special
court
is,
could
not
enter
the
kind
of
opinions
which
we
call
it
advisory
opinions
in
the
absence
of
any
record
as
to
what
the
final
system
plan
would
be
or
knowing
--
and
now
what
the
consideration
of
the
other
issues
which
they
dealt
with
would
ever
be
that's
the
third
circuit
court,
and
judge
hastie
said
as
the
chief
judge
in
that
court
had
notified
the
parties
they
would
reserve
the
decision.
again,
pending
decision
of
this
court
because
if
this
court,
in
fact,
the
reverse
is
the
lower
court
in
it's
holding
that
was
premature
to
consider
the
outcome
of
constitutionality
that
would
moot
those
issues
as
well
or
couldn't
those
issues
as
well.
so,
we
do
have
three
separate
things
pending
which
depend
on
how
the
court
acts
here.
going
now
to
do
the
questions
which
i
wish
could
address
myself
principally
namely,
the
significance
of
the
new
haven
inclusion
cases
and
why
the
court
should
take
--
should
grant
our
request
on
the
cross
of
appeal.
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
legislative
history.
i
can
refer
for
example
to
the
congressional
record
of
the
house
from
november
8,
1973,
where
states
in
the
debate
in
mr.
adams,
"this
is
a
constitutional
reorganization
proceeding
in
out
of
condemnation."
and
he
speaks
in
that
same
section,
"the
statutory
reorganization
use
in
this
bill
follows
that
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
cases."
now,
we
think
congress
even
in
attempting
to
carry
out
what
has
been
described
in
his
day
as
a
heroic
measure
was
wrong.
they
did
not
understand
the
new
haven
inclusion
cases.
it
is
a
decision
of
this
court.
it
is
in
case
in
which
my
file
has
a
long
history.
we
think
the
congress,
if
he
had
understood
the
new
haven
inclusion
cases,
could
not
have
been
acted
the
statute,
could
not
have
provided
what
it
did,
and
we
would
not
be
face
with
the
constitutional
issues
that
we
are
now
faced
because
the
attempt
could
not
be
more
clear
whether
it
be
in
104-member
motion
that
was
filed
in
the
court
last
week
to
make
oral
argument
here
as
in
my
guy
curiae
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
see
this
property.
now
in
fact
they
may
have,
whether
they
intended
or
not.
but
if
that's
the
case,
we
rely
on
youngstown
as
the
basis
of
the
decision
here
that
you
can't
say
that
tucker
act
applies.
there
is
anomaly
here
that
judge
friendly
was
amused
by.
we
have
the
government
saying,
it's
a
good
cause
of
action
against
the
united
states.
you
have
the
credit
to
say,
"there
isn't
a
cause
of
action
against
the
united
states?"
and
it
comes
down,
i
think
to
the
question
asked
a
few
moments
ago
by
mr.
rehnquist.
we
think
and
it's
a
fact
that
we
maybe
wrong
but
we
think
we're
talking
about
billions
and
the
very
idea
that
the
indian
case
which
was
some
$40
million
to
be
a
president
for
relying
the
fact
that
congress
is
our
obligations.
many,
many
years
down
the
road
and
we
maybe
speaking
of
a
dozen
years
down
the
road
is
something
which
is
creditors.
we
think
the
court
should
not
oppose
upon
us
and
which,
we
could
not
consent
to
as
being
the
best
interest
to
those
people
whom
we
represent
as
by
judiciaries.
because
of
this
melding
of
these
issues,
i
would
like
with
court's
indulgence
to
review
in
some
length,
the
history
of
the
new
haven
inclusion
case
both
before
reach
this
court
and
in
this
court.
the
new
haven
reorganization
proceedings
commence
in
1961.
mr.
smith,
the
appellant
cause
appellant
here
is
the
sole
remaining
custody
of
that
reorganization.
in
1967,
barely
six
years
which
in
reorganization
terms
pretty
rapid.
we
were
before
this
court
on
the
question
whether
and
this
is
the
title
of
the
case
of
the
penn
central
merger
cases.
whether
in
the
penn
central
merger
cases,
certain
new
haven
bond
holders
were
entitled
to
insist
that
their
consideration
be
determined
before
the
merger
could
be
carried
out.
and
with
mr.
justice
brennan
as
i
recall
that
argument,
return
to
counsel
for
penn
central
and
he
said,
"his
penn
central
willing
to
pay
whatever
is
finally
judicially
determined."
i
may
at
this
point,
point
out
the
icc
had
already
made
the
determination
which
the
creditors
were
objecting
too.
and
when
mr.
justice
brennan
asks
that
question,
counsel
with
the
penn
central
said,
"yes,we
will
pay
whatever
the
court
determines
finally."
thus
in
colloquial
terms,
we
haven't
open-end
transaction
and
the
court
refused
to
grant
the
request
of
the
new
haven
bond
holders
that
the
merger
be
held
up,
but
should
the
merger
can
go
ahead.
now,
there's
the
first
mistake
congress
made.
congress
thought
because
the
court
in
the
new
--
penn
central
merger
cases
as
the
foundation
for
the
new
haven
inclusion
cases
permitted
the
conveyances
to
be
made
required
to
be
made
as
a
matter
of
fact.
but
before
the
consideration
was
finally
determined
that
they
could
do
the
same
under
the
statute
and
the
statute
clearly
does
that.
we
don't
even
know
the
plan
is
when
conveyance
is,
until
the
very
moment
when
the
conveyances
are
made
but
the
new
haven
inclusion
cases
don't
say
that
nor
the
penn
central
merger
cases.
what
they
say
is
that,
where
the
consideration
must
be
paid
and
the
parties
agreed
to
be
bound
to
pay
whatever
the
court
determines,
it
may
proceed
that's
not
the
case
under
the
statute.
the
next
phase,
it
came
before
the
court
and
the
phase
i
mentioned
was
1967.
the
penn
central
merger
was
carried
out
on
february
1,
1968
and
the
next
phase
come
before
the
court
was
the
consideration
in
the
new
haven
case.
and
that's
the
opinion
called
"the
new
haven
inclusion
cases"
and
in
that
case
mr.
justice
stewart
grabbed
the
opinion.
just
eight
days
after
the
penn
central
had
itself
filed
for
reorganization.
now,
this
opinion
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
well,
i
regret
to
hear
that
mr.
justice
because
i
thought
it
was
mass
full
opinion.
but
the
opinion
eight
days
after
the
penn
central
when
it
reorganization,
made
note
of
the
fact
of
the
reorganization
and
then
had
to
deal
with
the
consideration
question
in
the
light
of
the
issues
created
by
the
reorganization.
and
what
it
happen
was
the
case
as
it
came
to
the
court
base
upon
the
icc
findings
at
the
early
had
been
objected
to
by
the
bank
holders
and
with
the
approval
of
judge
anderson
had
a
shock
turn
in
its
form
of
consideration.
judge
anderson
said,
"i
won't
disagree
that
the
stock
indeed
maybe
worth
$87.50
a
share
but
i
cannot
agree
that
constitutionally
the
creditors
are
obliged."
now
to
assume
that
it
will
be
worth
$87.50
a
share
at
infront
of
indefinite
period.
therefore,
i
would
require
an
underwriting
for
10
years
that
stock
must
at
some
point
reach
$87.50
so,
the
shareholders
can
get
out
of
that
would
be
the
new
haven
shares
shareholders
that
holding
that
stock
and
get
out
and
to
caught
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
cases
is
it
that's
no
good
enough.
it's
not
good
enough,
it's
just
doesn't
give
the
assurance
that
creditors
have
in
order
to
be
paid
properly
or
to
know
there
going
to
be
paid
properly
for
their
property.
and
the
court
remanded
the
case
with
that
specific
question
to
be
determined
which
was
the
fashion
a
payment
which
in
the
words
of
the
opinion
would
produce
the
proposal
liquidation
value
of
the
properties
which
had
been
conveyed.
now,
the
next
phase
of
that
case
and
despite
on
it's
an
academic
thing
because
we
don't
have
any
further
decisions.
but
the
next
phase
after
that
decision
which
occurred
in
june
29,
1970.
the
phase
was
judge
anderson
comply
add
of
orders
which
he
thought
would
tell
the
interstate
commerce
commission
how
do
you
expect
them
to
proceed
on
the
remand.
that
was
appeal
by
the
penn
central
trustee's.
the
court
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
reversed
judge
anderson
indicated
that
the
entire
amount
had
to
be
taken
off
in
connection
with
the
penn
central
merger
because
it's
bearing
upon
that
and
i'll
go
back
to
the
commission.
mr.
smith
comply
with
back
to
the
commission
that
would
have
been
in
the
spring
of
1971
and
at
this
time,
we
still
have
never
had
a
hearing
before
the
commission
which
ended
in
order
to
say,
"we
can't
do
this
and
we
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
the
penn
central."
now,
this
brings
us
therefore
right
up
to
what's
happening
with
this
new
statute.
the
new
haven
bondholders
have
now
waited
13
years
since
they
were
enjoined
by
judge
anderson
from
foreclosing
on
their
liens.
they've
waited
more
than
six
years
since
the
property
was
required
to
be
conveyed
by
the
commission
and
approved
by
this
court.
they
waited
more
than
four
years
since
the
court
determine
the
final
consideration,
that's
not
an
issue.
the
value
of
the
property
in
that
new
haven
inclusion
cases
determination
has
never
been
questioned.
that's,
that's
the
value
of
the
property,
a
$175
million
but
they
waited
one
of
four
years
to
be
paid
for.
if
the
rail
act
is
constitutional,
this
is
what
they
must
cope
with.
they
will
not
know
until
1976
or
let
me
interject
for
a
moment.
the
new
haven
trustee
has
a
lien
on
the
property
which
he
conveyed
to
penn
central.
we
have
a
legal
lien,
in
addition,
and
our
enjoined
from
foreclosing
it.
in
addition,
judge
fullam
granted
what
he
called
an
"indeterminate
lien,"
indeterminate
as
to
amount
so
the
question
would
be
remained
open
whether
the
new
haven
trustees
is
entitled
the
more
it's
just
a
bond
which
he
holds
on
the
eventual
payment.
and
we
conceived
that
to
be
an
aid
of
the
remand
from
this
court.
but
if
the
rail
act
is
constitutional
as
i
say,
they
won't
know
the
1976
whether
the
property
which
they
handle
lien
on
is
going
to
be
required
to
be
conveyed
to
conrail
and
if
it's
required
to
be
conveyed
conrail
it
gets
conveyed
free
of
the
new
haven
trustee's
lien.
and
he
must
then
just
look
to
the
penn
central
estate
without
a
lien
for
the
payment
from
the
very
properties
which
this
court
said
in
1970,
the
bondholders
entitle
to
have
the
proposal
liquidation
value
for.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
no,
mr.
justice
douglas,
it
does
not
follow
it.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
the
new
act,
no.
the
consideration
which
conrail
pays
as
fix
by
usra
goes
into
the
general
pot
of
the
debtor
for
--
whose
property
was
and
it
was
taken.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
well,
mr.
justice
white,
the
problems
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i
wish
i
could
ask
that
easily.
the
problems
are
not
the
reason.
the
reason
is
the
concept
of
the
statute
is
to
bring
together
five
railroads
and
pieces
of
five
and
if
--
and
to
illustrate
the
piece
of
railroad
a
which
went
in,
namely
penn
central
is
combined
with
the
piece
of
the
central
as
new
jersey
which
is
subject
to
it
too,
and
each
of
those
pieces
were
subject
to
a
lien.
and
now,
you
come
to
the
old
problems
of
the
sovereigns
evaluations.
we
just
don't
know
where
it
will
stand
in
our
liens
doesn't
follow
except
an
equitable
sentence.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
yes.
yes,
they
would.
they
would.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
well,
i
don't
know
if
you
have
a
prior
claim.
they're
bound
to
be
securities
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
we
all
remained
as
secured
creditors
of
penn
central
whose
security
has
been
conveyed
out
free
of
lien.
and
that's
what
happens
on
the
conveyance
thing
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
yes,
but,
we
know
now
what
our
value
is
to
penn
central.
we
don't
know
our
value
is
to
the
conrail
system
for
the
reason
the
carriers.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
joseph
auerbach
no,
and
we
won't
know.
you
see
that
the
conveyance
secures
presumably
something
after
two
years
but
the
evaluation
may
not
occur
for
now
to
ten.
and
that
is
why
i
would
point
out
to
you
that
when
we
talk
about
time,
we
have
30
years.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
in
new
haven
that
20
years
had
been
total
will
be
the
time
for
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
no,
of
course
not.
of
course
not,
if
the
penn
central
trustee's
came
to
us
today
and
check
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
well,
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
before
i
answer
that
directly.let
me
illustrate
by
--
mr.
joseph
auerbach
well,
yes
your
honor
but
the
question
with
the
bankruptcy
law
applies
is
one
which
i
can
illustrate
for
you
under
this,
this
very
case
and
what
i
would
call
this
on,
i
know
the
solicitor
general
use
that
word
this
morning
but
i
think
i'm
entitle
to
use
it
too.
in
this
very
case
we
have
this
situation,
the
new
haven
properties
which
are
owned
by
penn
central
essentially
the
boston
to
new
york
or
a
large
part
of
the
boston
to
new
york
portion
of
the
northeast
card,
the
balance
of
being
to
new
york
to
washington
portion.
the
statute,
the
rail
act
in
no
less
than
three
places
talks
about
creating
or
convene
to
amtrak
properties
in
that
northeast
card.
the
statute
provides
in
section
211
(a)
that
usra
may
make
loans
to
amtrak
which
would
buy
the
properties
from
conrail.
now,
the
very
properties
which
we
would
of
convey,
have
been
required
to
convey
feebly
into
conrail
would
be
sold
for
cash
by
conrail
to
amtrak
under
the
statute.
now,
the
question
i
have
and
i
try
to
ask
you
a
question
mr.
justice
is,
can
we
impose
a
lien
on
that
cash?
i
would
be
very
much
surprise
with
under
the
bankruptcy
law,
we
could.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
oh,
indeed
they
are
and
we
--
oh,
indeed
they
are
your
honor.
they
are
ahead
of
all
the
secured
creditors.
the
united
states
as
creditors
ahead
of
us.
all
the
taxing
authorities,
the
payments
have
not
been
made
on
rentals.
this
sums
up
with
--
well
over
half
billion
now
in
this
administration
claims.
i
can't
really
answer
your
question
except
hypothetically,
if
there
is
enough
fair
for
us
then
there
is
enough
the
for
us.
but
whether
there
will
be,
i
can't
answer.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
well,
the
rail
act
is
not
protected.
i
have
to
say
that
to
you.
i
can't
answer
how
judge
fullam
in
a
contest
among
creditors
for
what
we
think
would
be
a
very
sharply
reduced
part,
what
he
will
be
able
to
do.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
well,
bankruptcy
act
right
now
would
protect
us,
if
section
77
would
be
in
carried
out.
for
example,
we
have
a
section
77
(g)
this
motion
that's
been
pending.
if
in
fact
and
it
seems
to
me,
that
the
findings
have
been
made
by
the
special
court
established
this,
and
if
in
fact,
we
pass
the
stage
where
there
can
be
reorganization
of
penn
central
then
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
have
the
77
(g)
motions
granted,
and
if
is
that
constitutional
right
and
it
goes
into
liquidation,
the
equity
receivers
must
keep
those
properties
intact
and
liquidate
--
whether
they
do
it
on
mass
or
separately.
they
would
have
to
protect
this
--
them
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
mr.
joseph
auerbach
about
to
be
sure
and
the
special
court
decide
against
his
only
on
the
concept
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
tucker
act
applied
didn't
decide
against
this
otherwise.
now
as
it
happens,
we
think
constitutionally,
the
court
must
consider
the
statute
but
without
the
tucker
act
if
this
is
a
constitutional
statute
and
i
would
argue
that
the
detail
of
our
brief,
we
think
it's
unconstitutional.
you
don't
even
reach
the
tucker
act
as
we
see
it
till
you
pass
the
point
of
constitutionality
and
judge
friendly,
i
think
did.
we
think
he
was
incorrect
in
that
respect.
if
i
may
in
the
few
minutes
i
have
left,
i'd
like
to
turn
the
reasons
why
particularly
of
you,
of
some
of
the
question
asked
by
justices
this
morning.
it's
not
premature
now,
to
rule
on
the
question
raised
with
respect
to
constitutionality
of
the
ultimate
conveyance
not
just
the
interim
erosion
and
very
briefly,
the
court
now
knows
the
rail
act
compels
a
conveyance
of
that
property
free
of
lien.
the
properties
would
be
included
without
notice
or
opportunity
for
hearing
on
the
part
of
the
owners
or
the
judges
who
supervised
the
trustee's
in
the
section
77
proceedings.
the
congress
of
the
section
208
has
an
absolute
right
of
determination
of
what
will
go
into
that
final
system
plan
by
rejecting
plans
that
have
put
to
it.
fourth,
the
special
court
is
required
without
notice
or
opportunity
for
hearing
to
order
the
conveyances
that
are
provided
in
the
final
plan.
fifth,
the
trustee's
are
required
are
ordered
by
the
statute
to
convey
those
properties
free
of
lien
without
any
choice.
sixth,
the
rail
act
for
did
specifically,
and
i
think
that
was
mentioned
in
response
to
the
--
to
a
question
from
justice
rehnquist,
that
did
specifically,
that
any
enjoining
of
those
conveyances.
seventh,
the
amounts
provided
under
the
statute
and
now,
wholly
known
to
the
court.
you
know
what
it
is
congress
says
could
be
paid
and
no
more.
eight,
the
review
of
congress
as
to
any
court
ordered
revision
under
section
206
(i)
of
the
act
gives
it
the
right
to
reject
all
capital
structures
that
a
special
court
or
reorganization
court
would
be
necessary
the
premises.
