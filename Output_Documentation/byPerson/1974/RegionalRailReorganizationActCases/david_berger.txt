mr.
david
berger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
penn
central
company
which
is
the
sole
stockholder
of
the
railroad
and
reorganization
here.
we
agree
with
mr.
craco's
analysis
of
the
act
and
we
also
agree
that
under
the
statutory
scheme,
the
entire
risk
here
is
being
imposed
upon
the
claimants
in
the
reorganization
proceeding.
now,
mr.
cutler
has
stated
that
congress
can
stir
the
ship
of
state
in
between
seller
and
corruptors
but
the
stockholders
and
the
creditors
in
this
reorganization
proceeding
should
not
we
submit,
take
the
risk
of
being
torpedoed
during
that
extremely,
precarious
voyage.
and
these
points
up
the
uniquely
precarious
position
of
the
penn
central
company
as
a
sole
stockholder
it
represents
160,000
shareholders,
a
significant
portion
of
whom
in
judge
fullam's
words
do
not
readily
fit
the
image
of
sophisticate
investors.
moreover,
penn
central
company
has
a
massive
unsecured
plan
conceding
$41
million.
and
as
such
under
the
absolute
priority
rule,
penn
central
company
is
at
the
bottom
of
totem
poll.
i
would
suggest
that
enter
an
erosion
may
hurt
some
of
the
claimants.
but
interim
and
continuing
erosion
must
hurt
my
client
penn
central
company.
in
short,
penn
central
company
is
hurt
the
first
and
its
hurt
the
worst.
now,
no
one
in
this
litigation
is
contended
that
penn
central
company
had
or
has
no
equity.
the
trustees
figures
reveal
at
the
put
value
at
the
day
of
reorganization
was
some
$16,
066
million
of
the
equity.
and
as
of
the
date
when
the
act
took
effect,
this
had
dropped
the
$684
million.
mr.
david
berger
no,
the
date
of
the
petition
for
reorganization,
your
honor,
6/21/1970.
mr.
david
berger
and
on
the
date
when
the
acts
of
the
facts,
it
then
already
drop
the
$684
million
and
using
the
solicitor
general's
figures
coming
from
his
brief,
he
says
that,
the
current
liquidation
value
of
the
estate
of
apparently
exceeds
the
valid
claims
against
it
by
a
minimum
amount
of
$1.3
billion
what
she
contends
is
adequate
to
cushion
this
secured
creditors.
the
secured
creditors
don't
agree
but
it's
certainly
is
not
adequate
to
secure
to
constitute
a
cushion
with
respect
to
the
unsecured
creditors
or
the
stockholders.
now
dealing
with
the
past
erosion,
the
briefs
and
their
many,
many,
many
pages
on
this
point,
i
think
this
comment
is
warranted,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
facts
are
undisputed.
only
the
interpretation
is
different.
we
think
that
government's
interpretation
mistakenly
minimizes
the
past
erosion.
we
would
prefer
and
we
think
it's
correct
to
rely
upon
the
trustees
figures.
after
all,
the
trustees
or
officers
of
the
court,
they
certainly
have
no
motive
to
misinterpret
the
figures
and
moreover,
looking
at
the
history
of
the
reorganization
for
the
past
four
years,
the
trustees
have
supported
in
the
public
interest
to
continue
rail
operations
of
penn
central
even
at
this
huge
loses.
and
indeed,
they
have
steadfastly
resisted
claimant's
attempts
to
terminate
the
reorganization
proceedings
under
section
77
(j)
mr.
david
berger
we
have
since
petition
in
the
court
terminates
the
rail
operation,
yes
your
honor.
now,
their
figure
show
that
the
accumulation
of
post
bankruptcy
priority
claims
at
the
minimum
amounts
to
$745
million
to
which
they
had
a
very
conservative
figure
of
$40
million
for
the
physical
decline
in
the
value
of
the
assets
or
making
a
total
of
$785
million.
now,
we
submit
by
the
purposes
of
this
case.
it
is
not
necessary
at
this
time
for
the
court
to
quantify
past
erosion
of
the
penny.
the
secured
creditors
say
that
this
past
erosion
exceeds
$785
million
and
we
agree.
the
undisputed
facts
stipulated
in
this
record,
may
it
please
the
court,
is
that
$851
million
was
lost
in
the
penn
central
rail
operations
from
the
date
of
reorganization
to
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
this
act.
now,
we
submit
the
clear
witness
and
not
in
this
record
to
work
defining
of
the
court
below
and
the
reorganization
court
that
the
point
of
constitutionally
impermissible
erosion
has
either
been
reached
or
will
soon
be
reached.
and
thus,
the
case
in
this
juncture,
in
this
posture,
presents
a
question
very
like
that
presented
in
chicago
and
rock
island,
294
us
648-677,
sited
with
approval
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
new
haven
inclusion
cases.
that
it
presents
a
question
addressed
not
to
the
power
of
the
court
but
to
its
discretion.
a
matter
i
submit
peculiarly
within
the
discretion
of
the
lower
court
and
a
matter
in
the
words
of
rock
island
ordered
by
this
court
not
subject
to
the
interference
of
an
appellate
court
unless
discretion
will
be
improvidently
exercised,
it
certainly
no
evidence
of
that.
now
i
would
say
that,
erosion
in
the
order
of
$785
million
to
800
million
in
the
language
of
government
attorney
dausch
obviously
has
either
in
the
stockholder's
account
and
on
check
this
continued
erosion
will
not
be
into
the
stockholder's
attempt
or
will
devour
it.
clearly,
this
record
justifies
what
the
reorganization
court
said
and
it
said
that
"the
creditors
and
the
stockholders
of
the
penn
cent
have
exhibited
commendable
patience
and
restraint
in
supporting
the
continued
operation
of
the
railroad
during
reorganization
and
it
cost
of
nearly
$1
billion."
my
duty
representing
the
stockholders
i
submit,
is
to
try
to
prevent
the
wound
arising
from
this
massive
erosion
from
having
fatal
consequences,
to
prevent
the
government
from
conducting
this
railroad
experiment
at
penn
central
company's
expense
with
the
result
of
physically
killing
penn
cent.
now,
a
word
about
future
erosion
and
i
think
that's
in
misnomer,
its
--
we
used
that
phrase
in
the
briefs.
right
now,
it's
happening
as
we
argued
the
case.
this
erosion
is
continuing
right
now.
the
enforcement
of
section
304
(f)
inexorably
will
cause
continued
erosion,
as
a
trustee
characterize
it
today,
huge
loses
during
the
planning
period
from
january
2,
1974
until
the
consummation
of
a
final
system
plan
if
that
should
ever
happened.
now,
how
long
will
this
be?
well,
we
now
know
that
it
can't
be
for
a
period
less
than
two
years
because
of
the
120-day
extension.realistically,
i
think
we're
talking
about
three
to
five
years.
and
i
would
point
it
out,
that
there
is
no
limit
to
the
number
of
final
plans
congress
may
reject.
indeed,
there's
no
assurance
that
congress
will
ever
approve
a
final
plan.
it
seems
to
me,
that
unless
there
is
clear
explicit
protection
against
these
huge
ongoing
loses
which
the
lower
court
as
demanded
reorganization
court
estimates
would
run
from
between
$200
million
per
year
for
one
year,
$400
million
for
two
year
and
if
we
take
in
1976
as
part
of
the
planning
process,
$600
billion
that
unless
we
--
there
is
clear
express
--
explicit
protection
against
those
huge
ongoing
loses,
resulting
from
the
continued,
mandated,
penn
central
rail
operations,
as
mandated
by
304
(f)
that
the
act
must
be
declared
unconstitutional.
now
in
looking
at
the
act,
i
would
say
that
the
suggestion
in
the
government
brief
that
there
is
some
protects
and
against
this
interim
erosion
is
just
unsupportable.
as
a
special
court
has
held
section
303,
just
doesn't
provide
any
compensation
whatsoever
for
interim
loss.
and
i
find
no
support
for
the
contention
that
there
is
any
kind
of
protection
or
provision
for
compensation
for
interim
the
losses.
references
made
in
the
brief
to
section
213,
but
i
would
point
out
that
this
grant
provision
of
the
statute
provides
for
a
total
of
$85
million
for
all
railroads,
not
merely
penn
central.
the
department
of
transportation
and
as
shown
by
the
letter
of
mr.
barnum
attached
of
the
trustees
brief
say,
in
annex
a.
it
dependently
takes
the
position
that
these
fines
cannot
be
used
to
stem
further
erosion.
in
order
to
get
grants,
the
railroads
must
agree
to
maintain
the
service
at
present
levels.
so,
no
abandonment
or
discontinuance
are
all
possible
to
come
under
section
213,
so
that's
clearly
of
no
withheld.
and
that
brings
us
then
to
section
215.
if
we
looked
at
that,
we
find
that
section
215
provides
only
for
loans
not
for
grants
and
these
loans
are
restricted
in
their
use
for
acquisition,
maintenance,
rehabilitation
of
rail
properties
in
the
final
system
plan.
no
one
knows,
no
one
can
know.
it's
totally
unknowable
now
or
in
the
near
future
what
rail
properties
will
be
in
this
final
system
plan.
total
authorization
under
215
for
the
loans
is
$150
million
for
all
railroads.
and
i
think
the
use
of
binocular,
the
clincher
is
that
the
law
explicitly
provides
that
any
loan
under
section
215
is
and
will
be
a
charge
against
the
estate,
so
that
any
compensation
that
might
be
given
to
the
estate
for
the
ultimate
taking
will
have
to
be
reduced
by
amount
of
a
loan.
i
submit
a
summary
that
penn
central
company
interest
are
already
been
terribly
ruined
about
a
billion
dollars
up
to
the
first
three-year
and
being
eroded
at
the
rate
of
about
$200
million
a
year.
it
seems
to
me,
that
inconsumable
to
put
the
burden
of
further
interim
losses
on
the
estate
during
the
two,
three,
four,
five-year
period
until
the
final
system
plan
will
have
been
consummated
the
words
of
judge
anderson
paraphrasing
camden
the
new
haven
case.
the
public
has
had
it's
buy
from
june
21,
1970
to
december
31,
1973,
a
huge
buy,
$851
million
of
rail
losses.
i
submit
that
the
public
is
not
entitled
to
another
huge
buy
of
four
to
$600
million.
this
would
bring
the
total
close
to
a
billion
any
half.
it
seems
to
me
again
paraphrasing
judge
anderson,
penn
central's
duty
to
the
public
has
been
more
than
amply
fulfill.
if
this
huge
losses
from
mandated
coerced
rail
operations
must
be
continued,
that
can
only
be
done
to
at
the
public
expenses
mandated
by
fifth
amendment.
we
associate
ourselves
with
mr.
craco
and
with
the
argument
which
my
brother
mr.
auerbach
will
make
and
we
say
that
not
to
defy
the
constitutional
question
is
really
to
decide
it
and
to
decide
it
wrongly.
in
conclusion,
i
would
address
myself
to
this
question.
would
not
a
definitive
the
size
of
whole
name
by
this
court
that
the
tucker
act
remedy
exists
to
be
a
sufficient
answer
to
my
fears
about
interim
and
continuing
erosion,
i
think
not.
this
court
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
cannot
provide
a
real
response
to
a
money
judgment
of
the
court
of
claims.
we
can
see
that
whether
congress
undertook
by
this
act
to
provide
that
the
tucker
act
remained
as
a
remedy
is
a
matter
clearly
within
the
province
of
this
court.
it
would
therefore
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
determine
that
the
claimants
have
an
effect
and
subjected
to
an
eminent
demand
taking
for
which
there's
must
be
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment,
but
with
difference
this
court
cannot
provide
the
money.
if
the
estimates
of
continuing
entire
erosion
or
anywhere
near
correct
and
we
submit
they
are,
in
three
years
this
with
a
loan
amount
to
$600
million
with
the
existence
of
a
tucker
act
remedy,
afford
that
kind
of
assurance
which
the
fifth
amendment
mandates
of
just
compensation.
mr.
david
berger
i
think
that
this
becomes
a
matter
of
agreement,
justice
rehnquist.
we're
talking
about
the
$10,000.00
piece
of
property
that's
being
flooded
or
some
chickens
like
the
cosby
case
where
planes
flew
to
low.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
won't
appropriate
the
money.
but
now
i
think,
but
realistically
speaking
and
i
don't
want
to
repeat
what
mr.
craco
has
urged
on
the
court.
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
light
of
a
legislative
history
here
that
we're
going
to
have
some
difficulty.
in
fact,
i
would
quote
the
language
of
mr.
adams.
speaking
of
movements
i
think
that
is
been
mass
movement
of
some
kind.
here's
what
he
says
in
his
brief,
if
this
court
should
decide
at
this
time,
that
a
mechanism
of
the
deficiency
judgment
against
the
united
states
under
the
tucker
act
is
necessary
to
make
this
act
to
constitutional,
the
act
must
fall
since
the
legislative
history
of
the
language
of
the
act
that
clear
that
no
deficiency
judgment
against
the
us
is
authorized
by
the
act.
now
facts
this
case,
therefore
in
some
other
case,
where
you
don't
have
this
kind
of
situation,
where
you
don't
have
this
kind
of
legislative
history,
where
you
don't
have
this
kind
of
potential
very
large
claim
arising
from
admittedly
huge
losses,
there
would
perhaps
being
no
problem
about
an
appropriation
by
the
congress
but
i
submit
in
this
instance
there
is
a
very
serious
fact.
and
therefore,
the
only
real
practical
way
to
remedy
this
is
to
send
it
back
to
congress,
and
give
congress
an
opportunity
to
correct
the
constitutional
defect.
mr.
david
berger
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
berger
i
wish
all
my
clients
were
indians
but
i
seem
that
they
are
very
well.
but
they're
not,
all
is
stock
all
is
not
an
indians
here,
that's
number
one.
secondly,
the
largest
is
that
our
research
indicates
largest
judgment
the
court
of
claims
that's
been
from
which
an
appropriation
that
made
us
$40
million.
we're
talking
about
lastly
larger
sums
here
and
my
fear
is
as
express
by
mr.
craco
that
the
total
statutory
scheme
excludes
any
greater
federal,
fiscal
intervention
than
that
provided
for
in
the
law.
mr.
david
berger
there
is
--
mr.
david
berger
except,
except
a
realistic
one,
sir.
history
shows
that
were
a
judgment
is
of
that
nature
that
your
honor
indicated,
congress
does
normally
appropriate
--
mr.
david
berger
realistically,
may
i
please
your
honor,
mr.
justice
powell.
stated
by
the
government
counsel
in
the
court
of
law
that
penn
central
and
i
quote
"is
an
irreplaceable
national
asset
but
that
doesn't
give
the
government
the
right
to
treated
as
though
it
belongs
to
the
government
or
the
national
government
as
such
right
now."
and
i
would
suggest,
if
this
location
that
would
occur,
if
the
rail
operation
would
be
terminated
is
so
great,
that
the
congress
should
have
an
opportunity
to
decide
what
he
wishes
to
do.
now,
if
congress
says
that
it
just
doesn't
care
and
look
back
this
location
occurs,
then,
there
are
number
of
practical
alternatives
including
dismembering
of
that
the
railroads
selling
all
parts
to
the
different
railroads
making
transactions
with
regions
if
not,
with
the
united
states
but
wherever
regional
authority,
which
will
include
the
17
states
through
which
the
railroad
runs.
and
also
but
we
and
finally,
dismembering
those
parts
which
cannot
practically
be
continued
to
be
operated
as
well.
thank
you.
