mr.
charles
a.
horsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
as
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
for
the
trustees
of
the
property
of
the
penn
central
transportation
company,
the
debtor.
we
are
here
before
the
court
as
appellants
because
we
agree
that
the
act
with
a
minor
exception
that
all
come
to
is
valid
and
we
disagree
basically,
with
the
appellees
on
that
issue.
we
are
closer
i
think
today
this
morning
to
agreeing
with
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
and
the
government
parties
that
were
a
week
ago.
but
there
may
still
be
some
differences
and
in
some
respects,
we
agree
with
the
appellees.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
let
me
explain.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
solicitor
general.
the
reply
brief
filed
a
few
days
ago
in
which
the
solicitor
general
took
the
position
that
the
issues
were
available
and
before
the
court
has
made
vast
difference
in
our
position.
first,
let
me
say
a
few
things
in
general.
the
trustees
believe
that
the
basic
concept
of
this
act
is
a
sound
concept.
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said,
the
rail
crisis
at
the
northeast
railroads
created
a
situation
which
was
clearly
beyond
the
power
of
the
trustees
or
the
reorganization
courts
or
section
77
to
resolve.
the
compulsory
restructuring
of
all
of
these
bankrupt
railroads
in
the
northeast
under
the
act
is
certainly
a
potential
solution
to
a
very
serious
natural
problem.
there
are
good
many
imponderables
in
the
act
it
will
have
to
be
resolved
in
the
months
and
then,
the
years
that
are
coming
down
the
road.
and
the
remains
as
i
think,
everyone
would
concede
they
have
possibility
that
the
quite
disparate
goals
that
the
act
requires.
that
is,
that
there
would
be
a
profitable
conrail
created
and
that
it
would
be
adequate
to
serve
the
rail
needs
of
the
northeast
are
not
both
realizable.
but
the
effort
certainly
is
worthwhile
and
should
be
continued.
second
and
particularly
important
is
the
agreement
we
have
now
with
the
solicitor
general
that
issue
before
the
court
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
act
is
properly
before
the
court
and
should
be
resolved.
let
me
take
the
--it
should
be
resolved,
part
of
it
first
because
i
cannot
overestimate,
cannot
overstate
the
importance
of
having
a
decision
in
these
cases
on
the
constitutional
questions,
unless
and
until
this
court
decides
whether
the
process
--
whether
this
key
is
constitutional.
the
plain
fact
is
that
the
situation,
the
rail
situation
in
the
northeast
is
going
to
get
worse.
on
the
penn
central
alone,
there
are
thousands
of
miles
of
track
that
are
so
badly
in
need
of
repair,
the
trains
can
move
over
them
only
at
reduced
speeds,
10
miles
an
hour.
and
there
are
many
thousands
of
cars
and
many
thousands
of
locomotives
that
are
not
usable
because
there
is
no
money
to
repair
them.
the
act
in
section
215
reports
to
provide
a
$150
million
of
temporary
money
for
improvement
while
this
planning
process
is
going
on.
as
a
practical
matter,
that
$150
million
will
continue
to
be
unavailable
until
the
constitutional
doubts
about
the
act
have
been
resolved.
moreover
and
particularly
important
from
the
point
of
view
of
my
clients,
the
trustees,
they
themselves
are
unable
so
long
as
constitutional
doubts
exist.
to
know
how
they
should
use
the
limited
cash
resources
that
they
have
in
connection
with
the
operation
and
maintenance
repair
of
this
railroad.
if
the
estate,
if
the
penn
central
state
has
no
reasonable
chance
of
reasonable
prospect
of
compensation
for
interim
erosion.
common
prudence
on
the
part
of
the
trustees
would
suggest
that
the
cash
they
do
have
be
used
at
the
maximum
extent
possible
to
prevent
the
continuing
approval
of
the
administration
claim
such
as
taxes.
the
decision
on
the
constitutional
issue
will
really
relive
both
the
public
and
the
trustees
of
the
burden
of
the
present
situation.
i
agree
fully
with
what
mr.
cutler
has
said
about
it,
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
it
in
space,
it's
terribly
important.
third,
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
as
to
what
the
constitutional
issue
is,
"is
the
tucker
act
available?"
now
i
appreciate,
but
the
fact
that
we
all
say
that
you
want
to
decide
the
case,
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
will.
you've
got
to
persuaded
that
the
issue
is
right
for
decision
and
that
it
is
appropriate
that
you
decide
it
now.
i
think
it
is
and
let
me
say
a
few
words
briefly
on
that.
the
areas
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
to
you
two
quite
discreet
fifth
amendment
problems.
one
is
whether,
the
compensation
available
under
the
act
where
the
rail
properties
which
will
be
compelled,
which
the
penn
central
will
be
compelled
to
convey
to
conrail
will
be
adequate.
the
second
is
whether,
there
will
be
because
of
the
extent
the
length
of
time
that
the
planning
process
takes
an
unconstitutional
taking
by
way
of
interim
erosion
of
the
penn
central
state
because
it
will
continue
to
operate
as
it
does
now
at
huge,
huge
annual
losses.
on
the
first
of
these
issues,
the
court
below
said
the
issue
was
premature.
we've
set
out
in
our
brief,
pages
48
to
54,
the
reasons
why
we
think
the
lower
court
was
in
error
as
to
its
reasons
for
believing
premature
and
the
government
parties
have
adopted
our
argument
as
theirs
and
their
replied
brief.
but
without
going
into
the
details
of
that
argument,
let
me
emphasize
this
point.
under
the
doctrines
as
i
understand,
cases
like
the
ashwander
case
with
poe
and
ullman,
this
issue
is
right
for
decision.
there
is
not
any
doubt
but
the
--
there
will
be
under
this
statute
a
conveyance
of
properties
from
penn
central
estate
to
conrail.
there
was
a
suggestion,
which
hasn't
been
mentioned
here,
but
perhaps
would
just
confuse
you.
but
there
has
--
was
a
suggestion
that
you
could
litigate
this
question
before
the
special
court,
just
before
the
transfer
took
place
after
the
plan
had
been
finally
approved.
the
special
court
said
in
its
opinion
that
that
was
not
possible
in
the
time
that
they
have,
which
might
be
as
little
as
10
days.
they
certainly
couldn't
under
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
was
constitutional
consideration
provided
in
the
plan
for
the
properties
that
would
be
conveyed.
the
fact
is
that
this
conveyance
is
going
to
happen
and
that
there
is
no
other
court,
no
other
procedure
by
which
we
can
find
out
whether
or
not
that
the
process
is
constitutional,
whether
the
tucker
act
apply.
now
the
other
point,
which
i
think
is
even
more
important,
it
--
but
perhaps
sounds
a
little
bit
like
blackmail,
but
it
is
important
than
the
less.
the
special
court
has
ruled
as
you
will
find
if
you
read
its
opinion,
that
the
mandatory
conveyance
features,
what
i
am
talking
about
are
constitutional,
not
standing
alone
but
only
because
there
is
a
tucker
act
remedy.
consequently,
if
this
court
and
it
indicated
that
if
there
wasn't
a
tucker
act
remedy,
it
would
be
forced
to
operate
under
the
statute
to
remove
the
estates
from
the
operation
of
the
act,
because
it
would
find
that
the
process
of
the
act
was
not
fair
and
equitable.
consequently,
if
this
court
does
not
provide
the
assurance
--
let
me
go
back.
the
special
court
also
said,
"it
was
holding
its
final
decision
in
advance
pending
the
decision
of
this
court
as
it
was
entirely
proper
court
to
do."
but
if
this
court
therefore
does
not
provide
the
assurance
that
the
tucker
act
remedy
is
available.
the
special
court
has
very
strongly
intimated
that
what
it
will
do,
will
be
to
decide
that
the
process
of
the
act
is
not
fair
and
equitable.
and
that
will
therefore,
discharge
all
the
railroads
including
penn
central
from
the
operation
of
the
act
and
the
act
will
abort.
so,
for
practical
reasons
and
i
think
for
very
good
legal
reasons,
we
strongly
urge
that
you
come
to
the
question
of
the
tucker
act
and
decide
it.
now,
i
do
not
think
you
have
to
get
into
as
much
trouble
with
respect
to
interim
erosion
problem.
that's
the
second
of
the
problems
that
are
raised
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
court
below
reached
it
on
that
basis
by
holding
that
there
was
such
likelihood
that
that
there
would
be
a
point
reached
or
the
continued
compulsory
operation
of
the
estate
at
loss
would
be
unconstitutional
that
they
ought
to
decide
whether
it
was
appropriate
to
do
that
and
whether
there
was
tucker
act
remedy.
now,
the
conclusion
of
the
court
is
to
whether
that
s
likely
is
subject
to
vat
amount
of
writing
in
these
briefs.
there's
controversy
over,
what
constitutes
erosion.
there
is
controversy
over,
how
you
measure
erosion.
there
is
controversy
over,
what
the
various
measurement
shows
as
to
what
the
erosion
has
been
in
the
past
and
what
it
will
be
in
the
future.
there
is
uncertainty
to
be
sure
as
to
how
long
the
planning
process
will
last.
the
timetable
itself
as
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
has
been
extended
ones
by
four
months
by
senate
joint
resolution
250,
which
is
on
the
president's
desk
now
for
signature
having
pass
both
houses.
and
i
have
no
doubt
it
would
be
signed
by
president
ford,
shortly.
and
there
is
the
possibility
under
the
act
that
congress
may
reject
the
plan
provided
by
usra.
it
has
60
days
within
which
it
can
be
veto
either
house
can
veto
the
plan.
at
that
point,
although
there
is
a
tight
time
schedule
up
to
that
point.
at
that
point,
there
is
no
time
schedule
for
usra
to
submit
the
next
one.
it
has
to
do
it,
but
it
can
take
it
sweet
time
about
it,
the
next
month
and
the
next
month
after
that.
so,
that
nobody
can
be
sure
how
long
penn
central
will
be
continuing
to
operate
its
rail
properties.
all
of
these
mean
that
there
is
disagreement
to
a
degree
over
the
likelihood
or
the
degree
of
likelihood
that
there
will
be
a
point
of
unconstitutionality.
but
everybody
agrees
that
it
will
be
that
there
is
some
possibility
of
it
and
in
that
event,
only
a
tucker
act
will
save
the
statute.
and
i
further
agree
with
what
mr.
cutler
said.
if
you
find
that
the
tucker
act
is
available
on
either
the
unconstitutional
erosion
or
on
the
improper
taking,
you
have
answered
the
question.
because
nobody
has
suggested
that
the
tucker
act
is
available
for
some
of
the
takings
under
the
statute,
but
not
for
all
of
them.
well,
so
much
for
the
tucker
act.
i
don't
believe
that
i
need
to
add
anything
to
what
the
solicitor
general
has
said
about
the
nature
of
the
argument
on
that
question.
but
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
comments,
which
i
think
the
solicitor
general
did
not
make
and
which
i
think
irrelevant.
i
perhaps,
do
not
correctly
read
judge
aldisert's
opinion
below
but
i
sense
in
this
comment
he
said
that
if
he
found
there
were
court
of
claims
remedy,
it
would
be,
"judicial
legislation
on
a
grand
if
not
arrogant
scale."
i
think,
i
sense
in
that
a
feeling
that
what
he
was
afraid
of
was
that
the
possibility
of
a
court
of
claims
judgment
if
there
were
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims
would
be
huge.
it
might
be
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
or
even
more
than
that
and
of
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
he
thought
that
he
could
not
appropriately
say
that
the
court
of
claims
judgment
was
available.
if
that
is
true,
if
there
is
any
relevance
to
the
question
of
the
availability
of
the
tucker
act
as
to
the
size
of
the
potential
judgment
against
united
states,
there
are
a
couple
of
considerations
which
the
court
should
have
in
mind.
the
first
is
that,
a
decision
now
by
the
court
that
a
court
of
claims
remedy
would
be
available
to
remedy
any
inadequate
compensation
in
the
taking
by
the
compulsory
transfer
is
no
sense
as
the
solicitor
general
has
said
an
ex
post
facto
argument.
the
congress
can
deal
with
that
in
two
ways.
in
the
first
place,
it
has
to
look
at
the
plans
that
come
from
usra.
if
it
gets
the
first
plan
and
the
financial
viability
of
conrail
looks
pretty
shaky
or
they
are
not
sure
that
it
is
going
to
be
adequately
funded
or
adequately
profitable.
they
can
send
usra
back
to
the
drawing
boards
because
they
would
say,
"we
do
not
want
to
take
the
chance
that
this
one
might
cause
a
very
large
court
of
claims
judgment."
and
they
can
continue
to
do
that
until
they
are
satisfied
that
what
the
plan
provides
will
either
minimize
or
eliminate
the
possibility
of
a
tucker
act
judgment
of
any
substantial
size.
and
secondly
of
course
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
they
can
repeal
or
amend
the
statute.
but
i
think
it
--
this
is
a
fair
comment.
i
believe
that
it
is
probably
true
that
this
statute
with
the
combination
of
the
power
of
the
congress
to
reject
the
plans
it
does
not
like,
so
it
gets
a
plan
it
wants
combined
with
the
sort
of
combination,
reorganization,
condemnation
features
of
the
plan
with
the
tucker
act
remedy
at
the
end
is
probably
the
least
expensive
way
for
congress
to
preserve
an
important
national
asset
which
is
now
no
longer
able
to
preserve
itself.
or
to
put
it
boldly,
i
think
congress
would
prefer
a
tucker
act
remedy
to
the
requirement
that
nationalize
this
railroads.
let
me
make
one
other
comment
which
is
important
to
us
in
terms
of
the
tucker
act
in
which
the
solicitor
general
has
not
mentioned.
in
the
court
below
and
in
this
court,
the
appellees
as
mr.
cutler
has
pointed
out,
that
even
if
you
have
a
tucker
act
it
really
is
not
adequate,
it
is
not
enough.
we
disagree
basically
with
the
appellees
on
that
point
but
we
do
have
some
concern
that
if
the
court
finds,
that
there
is
a
tucker
act
remedy,
that
we
can
maintain
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims,
that
we
have
an
adequate
remedy
on
the
court
of
claims
and
not
a
chancy
one.
we
set
out
the
whole
argument
at
pages
63
to
67
of
our
brief,
but
let
me
illustrate
the
problems.
in
the
court
below
in
the
argument
before
the
three-judge
court,
i
expressed
some
concern
that
the
government
did
not
recognize
that
we
had
to
have
an
adequate
court
of
claims
remedy.
for
example,
that
the
government
did
not
recognize
that
the
fact
that
the
trustees
were
trying
to
accommodate
to
the
public
interest
and
we
are
trying
to
accommodate
to
the
statute
by
keeping
the
railroad
running
rather
than
trying
to
stop
it,
would
not
be
urged
against
them
in
the
court
of
claims
as
a
waiver
of
their
right
to
have
remedy
for
unconstitutional
erosion
if
that
occurred.
in
response,
the
counsel
for
the
government
gave
me
that
assurance
and
we
have
quoted
the
language
of
that
assurance
in
our
brief.
in
the
briefs
in
this
court,
both
in
the
briefs
of
the
government
parties
and
in
the
briefs
of
the
united
states
railway
association,
there
is
a
suggestion
now
that
--
well,
the
trustees
may
not
--
may
forfeit
any
right
to
unconstitutional
erosion
because
they
are
not
diligent
in
applying
for
permission
to
stop.
and
they
sight
section
304
(f)
which
permits
interim
erosion
with
the
permission
of
the
usra.
the
theory
apparently
is
that
unless
we
apply
to
stop
the
whole
system
and
usra
denies
us
that
right.
we
may
have
waived
our
right
to
compensation.
just
--
it
seems
to
me
so
painted
that
section
304
(f),
which
i
will
not
burden
the
court
with
the
dissertation
on
does
not
contemplate
that
usra
would
be
permitted
pending
the
preparation
of
a
final
system
plan
to
authorize
the
abandonment
of
the
termination
of
operations
in
the
liquidation
of
the
entire
penn
central
system.
indeed,
as
the
special
court
noted,
usra
does
not
really
have
the
power
all
by
itself
to
do
that
anyway
because
any
reasonable
objection
by
a
state,
local
or
regional
transit
authority
will
inhibit
usa's
permission
to
make
any
abandonment's.
and
plainly
it
seems
to
me,
no
application
by
penn
central
trustees
to
stop
operations
on
the
whole
system
would
be
entertained
by
usra
and
it
would
be
futile
to
make
the
application.
if
the
solicitor
general
and
mr.
cutler
still
share
the
view
that
we
are
subject
to
that
obligation
before
we
can
protect
our
rights
to
interim
erosion.
i
hope
the
court
will
disabuse
them
of
that
position
in
their
opinion.
now,
let
me
turn
to
another
point
as
i
have
indicated,
the
trustees
do
agree
with
the
appellees
here.
that
absent
to
tucker
act
remedy,
this
statute
can
not
be
sustained.
i
don't
propose
to
argue
that
position
in
detail
because
it
is
adequately
argued
in
our
briefs
and
it
is
adequately
taken
care
off
in
judge
friendly's
opinion
in
the
special
court.
but
i
do
have
a
few
comments
on
the
appropriate
relief,
if
the
court
determines
that
there
is
no
tucker
act
remedy
and
that
the
statute
therefore
should
not
be
sustained.
i
think
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
is
constitution.
i'm
going
to
relay
on
the
appellees
to
convince
you
that
that
is
not
the
case.
i
am
assuming
--
i'd
like
to
talk
just
for
a
moment
as
to
the
remedy
in
the
event
should
determine
that
the
statute
is
not
constitutional
because
there
is
no
tucker
act
remedy.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
i
have
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
have
one
point
like
that
myself
that
i
would
come
to,
but
let
me
take
on
premise
what
i
think
the
appropriate
relief
should
be.
i
think
the
lower
court
in
an
essence
structured
it
correctly
as
the
solicitor
general
said,
the
first
paragraph
of
the
order
just
enjoin
usra
from
certifying
the
final
system
plan
of
the
special
court.
that
doesn't
stop
the
planning
process.
it
permits
it
indeed
to
go
on
right
to
the
conclusion,
so
that
the
congress
will
have
whenever
it
has
to
deal
with
the
statute
again
a
completed
plan
before
it.
what
it
does
is
to
interpose
the
court
order,
the
stop
order
at
the
last
possible
point
before
the
inexorable
process
of
the
act
would
transfer
the
property
from
the
penn
central
estate.
paragraph
2
of
the
order
dealt
with
the
section
304
(f)
problem
and
i
think
it
appropriately
said
don't
have
any
inhibition
upon
the
power
of
the
reorganization
court
to
take
whatever
actions
are
necessary
to
protect
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
creditors.
but
let
me
come
to
the
third
one,
on
which
i
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general.
this
is
the
paragraph
of
the
order
that
you
inquired
by
justice
stewart,
section
207
(b)
of
the
act,
which
requires
the
reorganization
court
in
the
event
that
it
finds
that
the
process
of
the
act
is
not
fair
and
equitable
to
dismiss
the
proceeding.
it
is
possible
that
that
section
will
never
come
act
operation,
but
it
is
also
possible
as
i
have
indicated
that
if
this
court
finds
that
there
is
no
tucker
act
remedy,
the
special
court
will
affirm
the
decision
of
judge
fullam,
who
found
that
the
process
was
not
fair
and
equitable,
and
the
question
will
be
does
judge
fullam
have
to
dismiss
the
section
77
proceeding.
now,
it
is
a
very
curios
little
piece
of
the
statute.
we
suggested
in
the
court
below
that
the
only
possible
rational
basis
for
it
and
it
has
no
legislative
history
was
as
an
interim
device
to
add
a
really
quite
unpleasant
consequence
to
the
decision
by
the
reorganization
court
that
the
statute
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
it
would
presumably
be
an
equity
receiver.
we
can
live
under
equity
receivership.
but
all
of
the
problems,
all
of
the
ancient
law
that
you
have
to
go
back
to
find
out
exactly
how
you
operate
under
an
equity
receivership,
would
have
to
be
brought
to
surface
and
explore
and
i
frankly
do
not
know
the
extent
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
you'd
be
deprived
of
the
entire
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
apparently
of
section
77,
whatever
it
gives
you.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
in
order
to
carry
out
reorganization
or
liquidation
--
a
new
haven
type
reorganization
or
a
sale
in
pieces
or
various
other
kinds.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
it
is
not
reorganizable
as
a
profitable.
that's
--
that
has
been
decided
by
judge
fullam
in
the
so-called
120-day
hearings
and
nobody
disputes
that.
but
reorganization
on
an
income
basis
is
not
the
only
basis
upon
where
you
can
reorganize
railroad
and
all
the
statute
does
is
to
say,
"look
mr.
reorganization
court,
if
you
find
the
process
of
this
act
not
fair
and
equitable,
you
got
to
rid
of
section
77
proceedings."
now
let
me,
it's
not
--
it
isn't
part
of
the
statute,
but
usra
did
not
even
appeal
that
part
of
the
order.
they
do
not
care
whether
this
operates
or
not.
we
do,
we
are
operating
under
section
77
and
it
would
just
be
inconvenient
and
perhaps
worse
than
that
if
we
had
to
transfer
it
to
an
equity
receivership,
it
might
be
alright
but
raises
problems
that
we'd
rather
not
face
if
we
do
not
have
to.
now,
the
basis
upon
which
the
lower
court
entered
that
part
of
the
order
held
this
section
unconstitutional
or
was
it
violated
the
uniformity
clause
of
the
constitution.
the
appellees
have
a
general
attack
on
the
statute
on
that
basis
that
very
--
a
good
many
sections,
indeed
probably
the
whole
act
ought
to
be
strong
enough
on
the
ground
that
it
is
not
uniform
because
it
applies
only
in
a
region.
we
don't
agree
with
that.
but
on
this
particular
one,
this
particular
section,
i
think
it
is
valid
one
as
two
judges
in
the
court
below
did.
this
is
simply
a
state
that
these
particular
bankrupt
railroads
and
this
particular
part
of
the
united
states
must
be
denied
the
advantages
of
section
77
under
particular
circumstances.
if
a
railroad
on
the
west
coast,
tomorrow
files
a
section
77
petition,
that
petition
is
not
defeasible
under
some
--
under
the
circumstances
of
this
act
because
of
any
circumstances
like
this.
the
penn
central
petition
is
defeasible
under
this
act.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
am
not
sure
because
it
seems
that
you
have
here
a
situation
where
the
problem
is
imminent
as
between
debtors.
you
have
debtor
on
the
west
coast
whose
section
77
petition
is
not
going
to
be
dismissed
because
of
this
condition.
you
have
penn
central
which
where
it
is
going
to
be
dismissed
or
maybe
dismissed
because
of
this.
the
two
railroads
are
treated
differently.
now
perhaps,
you
can
treat
debtors,
debtor
better
on
the
west
coast
different
than
a
debtor
on
the
eats
coast.
but
you
can't
do
it
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
under
the
uniformity
i
should
think.
this
is
certainly
not
the
commerce
clause.
in
any
event,
we
hope
that
you
will
sustain
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
this
point
would
be
moved.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes.
the
special
court
will
then
finally
and
definitively
reverse
judge
fullam
and
hold
that
the
process
of
the
act
is
fair
and
equitable,
and
no
circumstances
the
--
about
section
just
doesn't
come
into
our
brief.
thank
you
very
much.
