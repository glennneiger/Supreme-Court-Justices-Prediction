f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
burger
i
was
simply
going
to
ask
you
if
you
would
take
off
what
you
a
guide
realistically
as
the
possible
alternatives
here.
i
think,
we
all
assumed
there
is
no
single
course
of
action
that
appeals
to
everyone
but
it
seems
to
be
a
consensus
that
an
income
reorganization
in
the
normal
census
not
visible.
i
take
it
you
would
not
really
be
eager
for
a
liquidation
under
the
hammer.
you
suggest
going
back
to
congress
but
there's
no
assurance
that
congress
will
come
forth
with
what
you
might
regard
is
more
generous
proposal.
what
are
the
alternative,
realistically?
