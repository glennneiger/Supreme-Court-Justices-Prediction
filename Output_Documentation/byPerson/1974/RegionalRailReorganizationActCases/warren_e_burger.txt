chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
74-165
and
the
related
cases,
blanchette
and
others
against
connecticut.
general
insurance
corporation
is
the
first
of
the
group.
so
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
if
the
worst
happens.
if
the
worst
happens,
that
three
or
four
or
five
years
from
now,
there
is
no
judicial
remedy
if
it
where
then
judicially
determined
that
there
had
been
a
taking
and
that
it
was
uncompensated
or
inadequately
compensated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
could
there
be
a
judicial
remedy
for
that
when
that
point
was
reached?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
would
have
something
to
do
with
the
appeal
ability
provisions,
the
review
ability
of
the
special
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
the
issue
of
constitutionality
can't
be
resolved
here
with
any
of
you
to
even
the
probability
that
congress
would
remedy
any
defects
in
the
future.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
cutler.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
cutler.
mr.
adams.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
adams.
mr.
horsky
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
horsky.
mr.
craco.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
amounts
to
a
repealer
or
does
it
not
in
your
terms?
no,
sir.
i
think
what
it
does
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
this
court
says
it
holds
that
the
tucker
act
is
not
repealed
and
controls
what
is
that
do
to
your
position
in
this
respect?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean,
when
i
pursue
that
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
craco,
you
may
continue.
you
have
--
now,
i
don't
know
exactly
how
much
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
such
an
important
question
mr.
craco,
it
would
have
been
very
simple
for
congress
to
have
made
that
clear
in
one
sentence
that
tucker
act
is
out
of
the
picture,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
suggesting
indirectly
that
if
there
were
some
hypothetical
way
to
take
a
poll
of
all
the
435
members
of
the
house
and
all
the
members
of
the
senate
that
majority
of
them
never
gave
this
subject
in
any
thought
one
way
or
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
that
score,
what
would
--
what's
your
view?
what
would
happen
if
conrail
could
not
pay
the
deficiency
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
some
people
who
are
concern
about
it,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
why
i'm
curious,
as
to
why
you
characterized
others
a
sliver,
sliver
of
value?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you,
mr.
craco.
mr.
berger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
burger
is
there
ever
?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
ever
any
assurance
that
a
judgment
in
the
court
of
claims
will
be
divided
for
by
the
congress
when
let
say
an
indian
tribe
gets
a
$50
or
$100
million
judgment
or
someone
else
gets
a
$50
million
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
answer
to
my
question
i
think
it
is
that
there
is
no
assurance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
congress
will
provide
the
money
to
pay
any
judgment
in
the
court
of
claims.
