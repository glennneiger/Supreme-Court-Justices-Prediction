well,
assuming
that
they
didn't
intend
to
do
anything
with
the
tucker
act,
the
tucker
act
is
still
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you're
argument
was
that
the
remedies
provided
here
were
different
from
the
remedies
to
tucker
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
how
could
they
be
precluded
the
tucker
act,
if
they
are
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
do
you
have
that
says
it's
exclusive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
there's
any
other
provision
in
congress,
it
wouldn't
apply.
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
other
provision
of
congress
as
action
wouldn't
apply,
is
that
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
say
that
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
they
did
but
to
say
that
the
tucker
act
does
not
apply.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
can
you
say
that
without
the
congress
is
just
--
without
mention
it,
they
would
appeal
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
limited.
