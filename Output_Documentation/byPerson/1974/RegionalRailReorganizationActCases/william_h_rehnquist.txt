h.

mr.
bork,
what
if
the
govern
--
what
if
congress
pass
a
law
saying
that,
five
years
from
now,
we
are
going
to
build
such
and
such
reclamation
project
and
describe
the
lands
that
we
are
going
to
be
taking
and
said
that
instead
of
paying
these
people
for
the
lands
and
money,
we're
going
to
pay
them
in
conrail
stock.
could
they
come
in
now
rather
than
five
years
and
get
some
sort
of
an
adjudication
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
that
plan?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wouldn't
a
typical
answer
this
court
be
that
there
will
be
time
enough
to
decide
that
when
the
government
actually
takes
your
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
that
were
the
--
supposing
following
up
my
brother
stewart's
question.
why
couldn't
the
presumed
victims
or
non-beneficiaries
if
you
want
to
call
it
that
up,
the
provision.
if
they
can
go
into
a
three-judge
district
court
now
and
seek
injunction
of
the
enforced
of
that.
why
can't
they
also
wait
until
the
properties
actually
taken
and
go
into
a
three-judge
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
and
the
question
is
whether
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
you
must
wait
under
that
statute
and
go
in
the
--
until
your
property
is
taken
and
go
in
to
a
three-judge
district
court
and
then
join
our
constitutional
or
whether
you
can
do
it
five
years
in
advance.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
can
conceive
of
a
statute
which
was
totally
it
adds
with
our
jurisprudence.
but
if
it
doesn't
go
into
effect
till
five
years
from
now.
that
does
not
mean
you
can
come
to
court
now
and
enjoin
its
operation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they
had
a
three-judge
district
court
remedy
now.
why
don't
they
--
why
won't
they
have
it
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
can't
they
enjoin
the
taking
at
that
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
at
least
the
taking
will
be
much
more
immanent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
judge
friendly's
basis
for
sustaining
that
by
the
court
of
special
appeals
or
the
special
court
was
that
in
effect
congress
was
including
all
presently
bankrupt
railroads
in
the
system,
and
if
--
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
make
that
argument
with
respect
to
your
point,
mr.
horsky,
that
judge
friendly
would
rule
against
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
i
can
see
that
might
be
a
basis
for
attacking
the
abandonment's
or
the
anti-abandonment
provisions,
but
why
would
that
afford
a
basis
for
attacking
the
ultimate
compensation
the
fact
that
interim
erosion
occurs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
in
the
position
of
your
client
in
the
reorganization
court
mr.
berger
that
the
operations
are
ought
to
be
terminated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
on
you're
theory
mr.
berger,
then
an
individual
against
to
whom
there
was
an
inversed
condemnation
ought
to
have
a
right
to
enjoin
that
rather
than
simply
suing
in
the
court
of
claims,
because
you
can't
be
sure
that
congress
will
appropriate
the
money?
