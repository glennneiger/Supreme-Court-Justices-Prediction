justice
potter
stewart
i
have
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
this
case
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
powell
have
joined.
this
case
involves
the
criminal
conviction
of
the
respondent,
john
r.
park
for
violating
the
federal
food,
drug,
and
cosmetics
act.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
judgment
of
conviction
finding
that
as
instructed
by
the
trial
judge,
the
members
of
the
jury
were
given
no
objective
standards
by
which
to
determine
whether
park
was
guilty
or
innocent
and
indeed
that
the
jury
were
allowed
to
convict
park
even
if
they
found
no
wrongdoing
on
his
part
of
any
kind.
today
the
court
reverses
the
court
of
appeals
and
reinstates
park's
conviction.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
powell
and
i,
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
criminal
conviction
was
totally
invalid.
the
instructions
given
by
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
were
a
virtual
nullity,
a
mere
authorization
to
convict
if
the
jury
thought
it
appropriate
to
do
so.
instructions
of
--
like
that
regardless
of
the
blame
worthiness
of
the
defendant's
conduct,
regardless
of
the
social
value
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetic
act,
and
regardless
of
the
importance
of
convicting
those
who
violate
that
act
have
no
place
in
our
jurisprudence.
a
fundamental
principle
of
our
law
is
that
a
jury
is
to
decide
the
facts
and
apply
to
them
the
law
as
explained
by
the
trial
judge.
were
it
otherwise
trial
by
a
jury
would
be
no
more
rational
and
no
more
responsive
to
the
accumulated
wisdom
of
the
law
than
trial
by
ordeal.
it
is
the
function
of
jury
instructions
in
short
to
establish
in
any
trial
the
objective
standards
that
a
jury
is
to
apply
as
it
performs
its
own
function
of
finding
the
facts.
we
deal
here
with
a
criminal
conviction,
not
a
civil
forfeiture.
it
is
true
that
the
crime
was
but
a
misdemeanor
and
the
penalty
in
this
case
light.
but
under
the
statute,
even
a
first
conviction
can
result
in
imprisonment
for
a
year,
and
a
subsequent
offense
is
a
felony
carrying
a
punishment
of
up
to
three
years
in
prison.
so
the
standardless
conviction
approved
today
can
serve
in
another
case
tomorrow
to
support
a
felony
conviction
and
a
substantial
prison
sentence
however
highly
the
court
may
regard
the
social
objectives
of
the
food,
drug,
and
cosmetics
act,
that
regard
cannot
serve
to
justify
a
criminal
conviction
so
wholly
alien
to
fundamental
principles
of
our
law.
before
a
person
can
be
convicted
of
a
criminal
violation
of
this
act,
a
jury
must
find,
and
must
be
clearly
instructed
that
it
must
find,
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
engaged
in
wrongful
conduct
amounting
at
least
to
common-law
negligence.
there
were
no
such
instructions,
and
clearly,
therefore,
no
such
finding
in
this
case.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
more
detail
in
a
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
mr.
justice
marshall,
mr.
justice
powell,
and
i,
respectfully
dissent
from
the
opinion
and
judgment
of
the
court.
