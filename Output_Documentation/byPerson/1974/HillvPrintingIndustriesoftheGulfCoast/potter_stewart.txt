justice
potter
stewart
as
requiring
a
sponsor
to
be
identified?
justice
potter
stewart
but
only
three
require
the
identification
of
the
printer?
justice
potter
stewart
first
sentence
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
sign
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
there
were
five
reasons
and
that's
the
first
one,
what
are
others?
justice
potter
stewart
now
how
in
the
world
would
the
name
of
the
printer
do
that
anymore
than
the
name
of
the
secretary
who
typed
the
manuscript?
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
the
point.
justice
potter
stewart
not
just
by
looking
at,
he
has
to
go
to
the
printer's
office
and
get
that?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
so
you
say
those
are
two
points,
but
a
little
difficulty,
what
are
the
other
three
then?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
can't
be,
that's
the
point.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
well,
then
your
needs
one,
two,
and
three
are
that
they
allow
anybody
interested
to
go
to
the
printer's
office
and
find
these
names
that
are
required
to
be
kept
there
as
matter
of
record
by
the
printer.
justice
potter
stewart
and
whether
it
be
a
member
of
the
public
or
a
candidate
or
somebody
who
suspects
dirty
tricks,
thatâ€™s
really
all
are
the
same
need
in
which
i
fully
understand
your
point
and
then
now
what
are
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
that
the
name
of
the
printer
is
important
only
because
it
is
tied
with
the
requirements
of
subsection
(b)
here
on
page
26
in
that
through
the
printer
you
can
get
the
sponsors?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
if
it's
only
important?
justice
potter
stewart
very
wisely.
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
thing
i
guess
is
that
if
there
were
no
other
possible
way
of
furthering
this
state
end
you
would
have
a
much
weaker
case
than
you
now
have
because
there
are
many
other
possible
ways?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
argue
with
the
much
less
intrusive
upon
your
--
