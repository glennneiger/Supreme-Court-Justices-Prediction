mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
the
executive
assistant
of
the
attorney
general
of
texas
and
i'm
here
today
representing
appellants,
attorney
general
john
hill,
texas
secretary
of
state
mark
white,
and
mr.
0059
the
district
attorney
of
harris
county
texas.
this
appeal
was
taken
from
a
judgment
of
three-judge
united
states
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
texas.
it
was
entered
on
august
20,
1974.
this
was
an
action
brought
by
several
printers
seeking
to
prevent
disclosure
of
their
names
on
certain
political
advertising
that
they
were
employed
to
prepare.
they
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
portion
of
article
1410
(b)
of
the
texas
election
code
which
states,
“all
printed
or
published
political
advertising
shall
also
have
printed
on
it
the
name
and
address
of
the
printer
or
publisher
and
the
person
paying
for
the
advertising.”
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
the
law
was
enacted
your
honor
in
its
present
form
on
--
the
amendment
became
effective
on
june
14,
1973.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
the
suit
was
filed
on
september
11th
1973
of
which
time
local
political
races
were
being
conducted
in
houston,
texas.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
no
your
honor,
the
texas
secretary
of
state
had
not
done
so,
nor
had
there
been
any
prosecutions
initiated
or
even
attempted
or
even
considered
to
that
time
as
evidence
and
the
record
will
demonstrate.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
yes
your
honor,
there
are
approximately
33
to
36
states
that
have
similar
statutes
to
the
one
under
consideration
by
the
court
today.
the
statute
we
have
under
consideration
however
is
unique
in
that
only
a
very
small
number
of
states,
i
believe
three
have
statutes
that
require
that
the
printer
also
be
identified.
the
statute
is
generally
similar
however
to
18
u.s.c
section
612
as
i
will
refer
to
later.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
three-judge
court
held
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
yes
your
honor.
we
would
reach
this
point
i
believe
in
the
compelling
state
interest,
one
of
them
being
as
chief
justice
points
out.
the
ability
of
the
voter
or
the
candidate
or
any
interested
citizen
to
be
able
to
determine
by
looking
at
the
piece
of
political
advertising
who
printed
it
and
then
go
to
the
printer
whose
address
and
name
is
indicated
on
the
piece
of
political
advertising
and
find
out
exactly
who
submitted
it
for
printing
and
that
is
one
of
the
very
main
reasons
why
the
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
yes
sir,
yes.
if
they
do
not
in
the
texas
statute,
but
in
other
states,
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
the
three-judge
court
held
the
foregoing
language
requiring
the
identification
of
the
printer
to
be
unconstitutional
and
that
it
infringed
on
appellees'
first
amendment
freedoms
of
speech,
freedom
of
press
and
the
right
to
assembly
and
said
that
there
was
no
compelling
state
interest.
also,
the
court
held
that
the
statute
was
void
in
that
the
phrase
person
paying
for
the
advertising
is
so
vague
that
man
of
common
intelligence
would
differ
as
to
its
meaning
and
application.
we
present
basically
four
fundamental
court
--
points
to
the
court
today.
first,
that
the
commercial
printer's
actions
do
not
constitute
speech
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
even
if
it
is
protected,
the
first
amendment
rights
or
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
to
press
do
not
guarantee
to
them
the
right
to
print
political
advertising
anonymously.
second,
the
portion
of
the
statute
in
question
does
not
substantially
infringe
upon
the
commercial
printers
and
publisher's
rights
to
association
of
privacy
and
to
the
extent
that
there
maybe
infringement
which
we
denied
that
there
is
or
were
shown
in
the
record
in
the
court
below,
the
state's
interest
in
disclosure
is
sufficient
to
justify
any
infringement.
third,
assuming
arguendo
that
the
printers
possess
such
rights
and
they
are
in
fact
infringed
upon.
the
purposes
that
are
served
by
the
reasonable
disclosure
requirements
of
article
1410
(b),
further
the
compelling
state
interest
of
protecting
electoral
process.
and
fourth,
the
term
person
paying
for
the
advertising
is
not
unconstitutionally
void
because
when
you
consider
the
statute
in
its
entirety,
any
reasonable
person
exercising
common
sense
can
sufficiently
understand
and
comply
with
the
requirements.
now,
before
expanding
on
these
four
basic
points,
i
believe
will
benefit
the
court
if
i
very
briefly
comment
more
on
the
background
of
the
statute
being
challenged.
from
1967
until
1973,
a
period
of
six
years,
texas
law
required
a
political
advertising
as
defined
in
article
1410
(b),
reflect
the
name
and
address
of
either
the
person
paying
for
the
advertising
or
the
printer
or
publisher
of
the
advertising.
i
might
note
at
this
point
for
the
benefit
of
court
that
in
the
appendix
which
is
supplied
to
the
court
at
page
65
is
a
full
copy
of
the
article
as
appears
at
the
present
time.
significantly,
not
during
the
period
of
six
years,
not
once
during
that
time
was
challenge
made
to
the
term
person
paying
for
the
advertising
as
being
unconstitutionally
vague.
in
1973,
as
a
result
of
the
experiences
of
the
officers
and
the
people
of
the
state
of
texas
in
which
unethical
and
illegal
conduct
and
political
campaigns
could
not
be
effectively
traced
and
thus
not
immediately
prevented
or
prosecuted,
the
texas
campaign
reporting
and
disclosure
act
was
passed,
designed
to
inform
the
public
about
the
financing
behind
communications
intended
to
influence
their
votes.
among
other
reforms,
the
legislature
changed
the
disclosure
requirement
from
the
disjunctive
person
paying
or
publisher
or
printer
to
the
conjunctive,
that
being
disclosure
to
the
public
of
the
name
and
address
of
the
printer
or
publisher
and
the
person
paying
for
the
advertising.
it's
the
change
by
our
legislature
of
only
just
one
word
from
“or
to
and”
that
brings
as
before
you
today.
as
previously
pointed
out
in
response
the
question
from
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
amendment
as
we
see
before
us
today
was
enacted
on
june
4,
1973
and
a
suit
was
filed
on
september
11,
1973.
there's
no
evidence
presented
to
the
court
below
that
the
candidates
or
political
organizations
had
declined
to
use
plaintiff
appellees'
commercial
services
nor
that
as
a
result
with
compliance
with
the
statute
that
the
printers
had
been
harassed
or
had
been
intimated
or
had
declined
to
undertake
any
commercial,
political
advertising
for
fear
of
reprisal
or
loss
of
other
business.
no
political
candidates
appeared
before
the
court
below
as
parties
or
as
amici.
in
fact,
the
only
evidence
before
the
court
was
affidavits
of
individual
printers
swearing
to
their
fears
of
a
possibility
of
a
reaction
if
they
were
to
comply
with
the
disclosure
requirement.
no
evidence
was
presented,
the
prosecutions
have
been
initiated
or
even
considered,
nor
evidence
of
how
the
act
would
be
interpreted
nor
enforced
by
the
appellant,
secretary
of
state,
mark
white
who
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
enforcing
the
uniform
application
of
the
texas
election
laws.
parenthetically,
a
reading
to
the
testimony
of
appellees'
only
to
the
live
witnesses
at
the
hearing
of
which
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
denied
by
judge
singleton
reveals
that
the
testimony
falls
far
short
of
establishing
any
likelihood
of
a
chilling
effect
upon
first
amendment
rights.
to
use
mr.
justice
marshall's
phrase
from
this
morning,
the
plaintiff's
counsel
supports
their
allegations
out
of
the
clear
blue
sky.
they
are
not
supported
by
the
evidences
in
the
record
in
the
case
we
have
before
us.
in
sum,
the
plaintiffs
have
failed
to
meet
their
burden
of
proving
to
the
court
below
or
to
this
court
to
declare
the
disclosure
provision
unconstitutional.
our
first
point
is
that
the
commercial
printer's
actions
do
not
constitute
speech
as
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and
even
as
such
speech
is
protected,
the
first
amendment,
freedoms
of
speech
and
freedom
to
press
do
not
guarantee
to
them
the
right
to
print
political
advertising
anonymously.
the
first
amendment
protects
not
the
written
or
spoken
word
itself
but
the
expression
of
ideas
concerning
social
policy,
political
views
and
religious
beliefs.
speech
or
conduct
however
that
expresses
nothing
of
political
or
social
importance
is
not
subject
to
first
amendment
protection.
as
judge
bue
points
out
in
his
specially
concurring
opinion
below.
these
printers
by
their
actions
express
nothing.
they
do
not
argue
that
they
are
denied
the
right
to
print
anonymously
their
own
views
in
support
of
or
in
opposition
to
a
particular
candidate.
to
the
contrary,
they
seek
the
right
to
print
anonymously
that
for
which
they
have
no
feeling
one
way
or
the
other.
indeed,
they
seek
to
avoid
expressing
any
type
of
conviction.
they
seek
constitutional
protection
to
avoid
expressing
only
their
name.
nor
did
the
printer
seek
to
distribute
ideas.
they
merely
received
orders
from
their
clientèle
and
return
the
finished
product
to
the
person
that
has
hired
their
services.
the
appellees
rely
very
heavily
in
the
tally
versus
california
case
to
support
their
position.
we
submit
that
the
tally
decision
does
not
in
fact
support
them
and
is
distinguishable
from
instant
case
in
several
very
important
aspects.
first,
the
los
angeles
ordinance
requiring
identification
on
all
handbills
were
struck
down
because
of
over
breadth
as
to
time,
as
to
place
and
as
to
circumstance
and
the
lack
of
any
relation
to
any
ongoing
governmental
interest
or
responsibility.
the
challenged
language
of
article
1410
applies
only
in
very
limited
times,
that
being
during
a
campaign
and
only
to
certain
groups.
those
printing
material
for
such
campaign
is
for
profit.
it
clearly
does
not
eliminate
anonymous
discussions
of
public
matters
of
importance
at
all
the
times
or
even
during
an
election
campaign.
the
purposes
articulated
by
mr.
justice
black
from
prohibiting
an
absolute
ban
on
anonymous
printing
are
far
from
applicable
in
the
case
at
bar.
now
appellee
printers
have
no
such
lofty
purpose
for
seeking
anonymity.
rather,
basic
only
to
profit
in
private
even
if
this
were
speech
that
were
protected
under
the
first
amendment,
as
mr.
justice
clark
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
tally,
the
constitution
says
nothing
about
freedom
of
anonymous
speech
nor
there's
freedom
to
press
as
illustrated
in
the
lewis
publishing
company
case
provide
any
such
anonymity.
the
brandsberg
decision
also
illustrates
that
freedom
of
press
does
not
guarantee
an
absolute
anonymity
especially
where
substantial,
compelling,
public
interests
are
shown
and
demonstrated.
as
will
be
discussed
in
a
later
point
here
the
state's
interests
are
compelling
and
when
weighed
in
the
scales
of
justice
against
any
possible
infringement,
may
tilt
in
favor
of
the
voting
rights
which
our
state
so
fervently
attempts
to
protect.
the
appellants
contend
that
the
case
more
properly
fits
within
the
rationale
of
the
insco
case
and
the
scott
case
discussed
in
our
brief
dealing
with
the
similar
federal
statute
18
u.s.c.
section
612
which
requires
identification
a
person
responsible
for
distribution
or
publication
of
political
advertising.
our
second
point
deals
with
the
asserted
right
of
associational
privacy.
the
portion
of
a
statute
in
question
does
not
substantially
infringe
upon
the
commercial
printers
and
publishers’
rights
to
associational
privacy.
the
printer's
main
reliance
on
this
point
is
naacp
versus
alabama
and
the
bates
versus
city
of
little
rock
cases.
now
this
relies
as
misplaced
for
at
least
two
reasons.
first,
the
rationale
in
support
to
the
right
of
associational
privacy
as
they
point
out
in
their
brief
is
to
protect
the
right
to
associate,
to
advocate
and
promote
political,
social
and
economic
actions.
the
right
to
freely
associate
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
ideas
and
erring
grievances.
ironically,
the
commercial
printers
do
not
seek
to
protect
the
rights
to
associate
with
the
political
candidate
for
any
such
reasons
and
has
made
the
base
of
naacp
versus
alabama
and
bates,
but
to
the
contrary
they
seek
to
conceal
their
identity
for
fear
that
someone
might
think
that
they
do
associate
with
their
customers
and
thus
damage
their
commercial
enterprises.
secondly
and
more
importantly,
the
holding
both
the
naacp
versus
alabama
and
in
the
bates
decision
was
that
in
each
instance,
the
law
in
question
imposing
some
burden
on
the
first
amendment
right
was
not
shown
to
have
a
relevant
or
substantial
correlation
to
the
state
interest
sought
to
be
furthered.
in
the
case
at
bar,
the
substantial
and
compelling
interests
are
shown
by
the
state
in
a
limited
disclosure
requirement
of
article
1410.
the
naacp
versus
alabama
and
the
tally
case
both
recognized
that
disclosure
maybe
required
when
as
here
the
state
show
good
faith
efforts
to
protect
a
fundamental
interest.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
why
does
the
state
need
to
know
the
name
of
the
printer?
we
feel
your
honor
that
there
are
about
five
reasons
why
the
state
needs
to
know
the
name
of
the
printer,
all
of
which
go
to
protect
the
voting
rights
of
the
public.
first
of
all,
we'd
say
that
they
need
to
know
the
names
of
the
printer
in
order
to
give
a
candidate
or
any
other
citizen
a
right
to
fairly
reply
to
what
the
political
advertising
is,
not
as
prohibited
by
the
miami
herald
case,
the
access
to
the
press.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
you
mean
when
you
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
your
honor,
if
the
candidate
or
any
person
has
the
name
of
the
printer
on
the
piece
of
political
advertising,
he
can
look
to
see
who
made
such
statement.
he
can
look
at
the
piece
of
political
advertising
and
say
who
made
the
statement,
who
calls
this
to
be
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
no,
your
honor,
but
the
requirements
of
the
statute
are
that
the
printer
keep
at
his
shop
the
name
of
a
bent
individual
that
came
to
him
and
submitted
it
for
publication.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor
but
the
name
that
is
printed
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
no,
your
honor,
the
printer
would
publish;
number
one,
the
name
of
the
person
that's
paying.
that
name
might
not
necessarily
be
the
same
name
as
the
individual
who
submitted
to
him.
for
example,
the
name
that
he
might
put
on
the
piece
of
political
advertising
might
be
the
citizens
for
the
election
of
john
doe,
the
name
submitted
to
him
by
the
individual.
if
you
person
out
and
the
community
wanted
to
see
who
submitted
that
on
behalf
of
the
citizen
for
john
doe,
knowing
who
the
printer
is,
you
could
go
to
the
printer
and
he
would
have
on
the
record
who
submitted
it.
he
would
have
the
name
of
the
individual.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
no,
your
honor,
under
the
statute,
he's
required
to
have
the
name
of
the
individual
which
might
not
necessarily
be
the
name
of
the
person
paying.

john
w.
odam

john
w.
odam
jr.
signed
by
the
individual
contract
and
therefore
in
showing
his
full
address
and
if
his
agent
name
of
the
candidate
political
committee
within
this
enterprise.
in
other
words,
the
name
is
printed
on
the
piece
of
political
advertising
might
be
the
political
committee
versus
citizen
for
john
doe
and
if
you
want
to
find
out
who
submitted
it.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
well,
your
honor,
by
having
the
printer
do
it,
it
allows
the
entire
public
during
a
political
campaign
to
know
who
distributed
it
by
knowing
who
submitted
it
to
the
printer.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
the
second
reason
your
honor
is
that
it
allows
the
voter
to
be
better
informed
in
casting
his
ballot.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
your
honor,
if
you
know
who
the
printer
is,
it
allows
by
knowing
who
the
printer
is
which
ties
very
closely
into
the
other
point
to
know
who
submitted
the
material
to
be
printed.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
well,
the
first
point
allows
a
candidate
to
reply
to
whatever
it
is.
my
second
point
is
to
allow
any
individual
voting
in
the
campaign
to
know
who
submitted
it.
in
other
words,
under
the
first
point,
the
candidate
would
know
who
submitted
it
and
be
able
to
reply
more
directly
by
knowing
where
the
piece
of
political
advertising
came
from.
the
second
point
is
that
any
candidate
would
be
better
informed
by
knowing
exactly
who
submitted
it
to
the
printer.
they
are
more
or
less
one
the
same
but
the
first
as
protected
candidate
or
any
other
citizen
who
might
be
discussed
in
the
piece
of
political
advertising.
the
second
is
to
allow
the
voter
when
looking
at
the
piece
of
political
advertising
to
be
able
to
evaluate
accordingly.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
absent
that,
he
is
not
able
to
totally
evaluate.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
the
third
point
your
honor
is
that
this
disclosure
will
greatly
deter
one
from
attempting
a
falsely
attributed
smear
as
in
the
dallas
grady
case
or
in
the
insco
cases
that
are
discussed
in
our
brief.
the
reason
for
this,
i
would
submit
is
that
if
a
candidate
or
political
committee
or
business
entity
is
required
and
knows
there
will
state
on
a
piece
of
political
advertising
who
printed
it,
it
would
deter
them
from
putting
out
a
smear
sheet
in
the
first
place
because
they
know
it
can
be
tracked
down
or
at
least
the
first
line
of
defense
is
allowed
by
going
to
the
printer
and
finding
out
who
put
out.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
that's
correct
and
i'm
saying
that
both
names.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
no,
your
honor
but
it
allows
at
least
to
know
who
the
printer
is
to
go
with
to
find
in
the
first
place,
not
necessarily
where
the
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
well,
the
point
your
honor
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
well,
other
methods
would
be
available.
we're
not
talking
about
going
after
the
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
we're
talking
about
going
after
the
candidate
or
the
political
committee
who
intended
to
have
it
distributed
in
the
first
place.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
the
fourth
point
your
honor
is
that
it'll
greatly
assist
the
officials
in
checking
the
accuracy
of
expenditure
required
to
be
reported
under
other
provisions
of
the
texas
campaign
and
disclosure
act.
by
these
candidates
in
texas
must
is
in
many
states
submit
in
austin
or
at
the
district
level
of
the
county
exactly
what
expenditures
they
made.
well,
there's
no
way
to
check
that
out.
they
registered
in
austin
as
to
what
they
are
and
they
say
they
made
these
expenditures
or
you
have
to
take
their
word
for
it
unless
you
have
some
other
way
of
checking
it
out.
this
is
not
only
available
to
state
official
but
to
any
public
official
whether
it
be
a
candidate
or
anyone
else
to
determine
exactly
how
much
was
expended
and
to
verify
whether
or
not
that
is
correct.
and
the
fifth
point
your
honor
is
that
before
the
1973
amendment,
the
printer
was
required
to
retain
the
name
of
the
contracting
party.
that
requirement
was
virtually
meaningless
because
until
this
point
you
wouldn't
know
who
the
printer
who
is
required
to
make
the
disclosure
or
retain
the
information
in
the
first
place.
now,
taking
or
assuming
that
that
is
a
valid
consideration,
that
is
that
the
printer
be
required
to
keep
the
name
of
who
submitted
to
him,
it
is
meaningless
unless
you're
able
to
find
out
who
the
printer
is
in
the
first
place.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor
but
our
purpose
in
passing
the
statute
is
not
to
enhance
necessarily
our
libel
or
slander
laws.
we're
concerned
by
informing
the
public
at
the
time
that
political
election
is
going
on
not
to
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
well,
i
believed
mr.
justice
that
simply
because
that
there
is
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
i
don't
believe
that
is
correct
your
honor
because
we're
not
only
concerned
about
items
would
fall
as
far
as
being
libelous
or
slanderous
but
we're
talking
about
in
a
campaign
where
a
slight
difference.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
no
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
your
honor
these
we
submit
are
the
five
reasons
which
all
go
to
the
compelling
state
interest
which
we
feel
is
indicated
here.
in
other
words,
if
you
have
the
freedom
of
speech
to
say
that
it
exists
or
this
speech
is
protected,
to
say
that
it
is
been
infringed
upon
for
all
of
these
reasons
which
we
have
just
discussed.
we
in
texas
are
attempting
to
protect
the
public’s
voting
rights,
to
have
a
fair
and
honest
and
open
election.
we
care
nothing
about
trying
to
help
someone
later
on
have
a
civil
libel
suit
against
someone
but
to
help
with
the
election
at
the
time
that
is
going
on.
the
states
of
the
union
are
vested
with
a
primary
responsibility
for
the
regulation
of
election
processes
within
our
boundaries
for
both
federal
and
state
congressional
elections.
the
importance
of
the
responsibilities
underlying
article
1,
section
4
of
the
united
states
constitution
that
the
states
have
the
compelling
interest
in
preserving
the
integrity
and
the
orderliness
of
election
process
cannot
be
a
matter
of
dispute.
the
interest
has
its
foundation
in
the
right
of
all
citizens,
voters
and
candidates
to
choose
their
governmental
representatives
in
an
orderly,
fair,
and
democratic
process.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
yes,
your
honor
but
i
think
that
the
point
on
that
is
that
the
--
by
identifying
on
a
piece
of
political
advertising
exactly
who
the
printer
is,
they
are
put
in
actual
practical
parity
with
the
television
station.
this
particular
statute
would
require
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
your
honor,
as
i
recall
there
is
an
exemption
as
put
out
and
this
one
exception
to
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
me
earlier
about
newspapers
that
they
would
not
be
required
since
it
obviously
speaks
from
slays
who
is
putting
it
out.
with
the
newspapers
you
can
look
at
the
newspaper
and
go
to
the
source,
you
can
look
to
the
television
set
and
go
to
the
source.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
no
your
honor
but
the
newspaper.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
yes
your
honor.
what
i
mean
by
an
exception
is
they're
not
required
at
the
bottom
of
political
advertising.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor
and
they're
covered
in
article
1410
(b)
under
publishers
or
printers
referred
to
there.
i
don't
have
time
to
go
into
our
last
point
that
deals
with
the
board
for
vagueness
but
i'm
sure
they
will
cover
that
and
perhaps
i
have
a
little
bit
of
time
left
to
respond
the
questions.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
your
honor
as
far
as
alternative
methods
are
concerned,
i
believe
that
--
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
your
honor
i
would
appear
to
hear
what
mr.
birnberg's
suggestion
would
be
if
the
state
of
texas
will
require
printers
to
come
and
identify
themselves
before
they
undertake
any
type
of
registration.
i
believe
that
you
have
more
serious
constitutional
problems
as
far
as
prior
registration
if
a
coded
bug
system
were
to
come
into
play.
another
alternative
that
they
suggest
is
some
type
of
central
repository
where
every
type
of
political
advertising
from
the
entire
state
of
texas
a
copy
of
such
a
sense
somewhere
that
legislature
certainly
has
a
right
in
considering
alternative
methods
if
they
want
to
have
such
central
repository
are
allowed
to
have
to
the
voter
which
we
are
most
concerned
with
or
compelling
state
interest
to
protect
the
voter's
rights,
let
the
voter
know
when
he
looks
at
a
piece
of
political
advertising
who
printed
it.
now,
that's
what
we're
concerned
about.
the
alternative
means
therefore
to
answer
your
question
would
not
accompany
this
purpose.
mr.
john
w.
odam
jr.
i'm
sure
that
that
would
be
the
case
your
honor.
it
would
--
again
the
bug
system,
the
coded
system
would
not
avail
to
the
voters
to
know
and
as
the
chief
justice
points
out
would
come
into
the
licensing
--
prior
licensing
before
they
could
even
go
into
effect.
there
are
only
two
closing
points
i
would
make
your
honor
would
be
number
one,
that
the
evidence
before
this
court
such
as
opposing
counsel
has
referred
to
was
not
for
the
record
that
the
three-judge-court,
the
references
made
to
the
problems
that
the
lady
have
with
regard
to
her
feelings
about
supporting
a
republican
candidate.
that
was
at
the
temporary
restraining
order
but
was
not
a
part
of
the
record
that
the
tro
or
excuse
me
at
the
three-judge-court
hearing.
again,
this
record
is
void
of
law
to
support
the
position
as
well
as
the
facts
as
developed
in
this
record
when
considering
the
record
as
a
whole
and
therefore
we're
respectfully
pray
that
this
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
three-judge-court
below.
thank
you.
