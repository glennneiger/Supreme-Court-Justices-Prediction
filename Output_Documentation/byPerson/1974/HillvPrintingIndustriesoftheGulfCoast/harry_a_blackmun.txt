haven't
statutes
of
this
kind
been
in
effect
in
other
states
for
many
years?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i'm
a
little
disturbed
by
your
approach
on
less
restrictiveness.
is
this
all
was
a
constitutional
measure
that
something
might
have
been
done
a
little
less
restrictively?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
any
imaginative
lawyer
can
always
come
up
with
something
that's
a
little
less
restrictive,
would
he
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn't
that
the
impossible
to
achieve
standard
when
you
take
this
position?
justice

impossible
to
achieve.
