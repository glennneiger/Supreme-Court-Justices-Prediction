this
side
i
suppose
among
other
things
enables
the
reader
trace
back
the
material
to
its
source
even
if
the
names
of
the
sponsors
are
either
fictitious
or
meaningless
for
the
readers
that
part
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
of
the
statutes
require
the
costs
also
to
be
indicated,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
birnberg?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
texas
have
a
freedom
of
information
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
one
might
went
off
the
street
and
say
to
the
secretary
of
the
state,
we
want
to
know
what
printer
has
code
number
2341?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
is
that
any
less
intrusive?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
concede
that
it's
a
proper
state
interest
to
track
down
as
you
put
it
a
piece
of
scurrilous
campaign
literature?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
never
a
better
way
to
do
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
would
you
like
to
address
your
friend's
argument
that
the
act
of
printing
is
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
the
act
of
printing
these
documents
is
conduct
since
it
doesnâ€™t
express
any
ideas
of
any
kind
of
printer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
that
been
as
followed
up
by
the
obscenity
cases
on
the
mailing
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
your
point
vanishes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
birnberg.
you
have
three
minutes
left
mr.
odam.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suspect
that
they
have
this
coding
system
that
we'd
be
confronted
with
an
argument
that
this
was
in
affect
a
disguised
licensing
of
printers?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.

announcement

general
of
texas
against
the
printing
industries
of
the
gulf
coast.
and
here
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
the
new

and
for
dismissal,
if

case
is
or
becomes
moot.

the

of
this
case.
