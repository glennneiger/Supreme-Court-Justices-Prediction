mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
respond
generally
to
the
statements
which
have
been
made
and
some
of
the
questions
which
would
be
asked,
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
overall
concept
of
what
is
the
purpose
of
article
1410
(b).
why
do
you
need
the
name
of
the
printer?
you
need
the
name
of
the
printer
so
the
state
of
texas
tells
us
printed
on
the
surface
of
political
advertising
so
that
individuals
receiving
that
political
advertising
can
go
to
the
printer's
place
and
receive
a
copy,
a
signed
copy
of
the
statement
required
also
by
article
1410
although
not
in
this
particular
challenged
provision.
i
want
the
court
to
understand
very
distinctly
that
the
printers
have
not
in
any
way
challenged
the
record
keeping
provisions
of
the
act.
all
that
the
printers
have
challenged
and
attacked
is
that
provision
of
the
texas
election
code
which
requires
the
printers
to
print
their
name
and
address
for
public
dissemination,
for
public
dissemination
on
the
printed
material.
now,
with
regard
to
what
information
the
public
and
then
get
once
they
get
to
the
printers,
they
get
the
information
on
the
form
provided
by
article
1410.
that
information
requires
that
the
printer
keep
a
signed
copy
of
the
ad
signed
by
the
person
contracting
therefore,
the
person
contracting
therefore.
now
in
answer
to
the
question
posed
by
the
plaintiffs
below,
what
does
the
phrase,
the
person
paying
for
the
advertising
mean?
the
defendants,
the
secretary
of
state
and
the
attorney
general
of
texas
answered
in
their
brief
below
at
page
four
of
the
brief
that
it
was
very
easy
to
tell
who
is
the
person
paying
for
the
advertising.
the
person
paying
for
the
advertising
is
the
individual
contracting
therefore
and
such
individual's
full
name
and
address
must
appear
in
so
forth
and
so
on.
so,
in
other
words,
the
only
information
that
you
can
get
by
going
to
the
printer
is
the
information
which
the
state
maintains
must
be
on
the
face
of
the
political
advertising
itself
apart
from
the
printer's
name,
namely
the
name
of
the
person
paying
for
the
advertising.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
the
printers
object
because
as
you'll
note
on
the
record
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
marshall,
their
experience
has
been
that
when
individuals
see
their
name
and
address
associated
with
particular
political
positions,
particular
political
advertising
that
that
has
dire
reprisal
affects
to
them,
that
they
have
been
exposed
to
various
forms
of
--
as
we've
got
in
the
record,
physical
reprisal,
property,
damage,
economic
reprisals,
and
various
forms
of
harassment
and
so
forth,
when
people
identify
the
printers
with
supporting
by
at
a
very
lease
not
refusing
to
undertake
political
advertising.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
absolutely,
mr.
justice
marshall.
however,
the
chances
of
the
members
of
this
court
or
any
other
court
reacting
in
a
manner
as
some
texas
voters
do
[laughter]
is
not
really
substantial
and
indeed
that
is
in
fact
the
problem.
the
identification
of
the
printer
during
the
heat
of
a
political
campaign
particularly
is
calculated
to
cause
tempers
to
fly,
hard
feelings
to
be
felt
and
those
sorts
of
things
to
take
place.
now,
there's
no
evidence
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i
assume
that
yes
your
honor.
i
don't
know
that
we
have
any
evidence
of
that
in
the
record
and
i
wouldn't
suggest
to
the
court
any
particular
factual
case
but
indeed
for
example,
the
named
plaintiff,
mary
ann
coleman
experienced
in
becoming
publicly
affiliated,
publicly
associated,
publicly
known
as
a
republican
in
the
self
texas
areas.
she
was
beaten
up
and
had
various
other
forms
of
reprisals
directed
against
her.
as
a
result
of
all
of
that,
she
undertook
to
formulate
--
once
article
1410
(b)
was
announced,
she
undertook
to
formulate
for
her
company
a
policy;
“our
company
will
not
undertake
political
advertising
so
long
as
we
must
publicly
identify
ourselves
and
publicly
disclose
that
we
support
particular
political
candidates
because
it's
dangerous,
it
causes
all
sorts
of
problems
and
we're
not
going
to
do
it
anymore.”
now,
that
meant
that
with
the
advent
of
article
1410
(b)
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
your
point
mr.
justice.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
well,
in
addition
of
course
to
republicans
mr.
justice
marshall.
no,
of
course
not,
but
if
you
consider
in
even
the
more
disunite
political
situations,
the
individual
who
prints
for
the
socialist
workers
party
or
the
american-nazi
party
or
the
communist
party
or
the
john
burkes
society
or
any
of
the
more
dissident
political
groups
that
the
more
dissident
the
political
expression,
the
less
likely
the
printer
is
going
to
be
to
undertake
that
advertising
in
the
first
instance
if
he
must
associate
himself
openly
and
publicly.
now,
all
we've
asked
is
through
this
suit,
aren't
their
means
less
restrictive
on
the
printer's
rights
to
associational
privacy,
aren't
there
ways
to
accomplish
each
and
everyone
of
these
admittedly,
legitimate
state
interests
without
imposing
upon
the
printer's
rights
to
political
privacy,
associational
privacy,
at
least
to
as
severe
and
extent
as
article
1410
(b)
does.
thus
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
for
precisely,
for
example
that
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
suggested
the
coded
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
they
could
be
required,
they
could
choose
to
register
and
receive
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
right
and
if
they
chose
not
to
register,
not
to
get
that
number,
they
could
in
that
circumstance
print
the
name
and
address.
another
thing
on
the
political
advertising,
but
that
would
be
no
more
restrictive
or
no
more
of
a
licensing
or
a
registration
statute
than
requiring
printers
in
the
printing
business
to
get
employer
identification
numbers
for
internal
revenue
purposes.
so,
just
get
a
number
and
use
a
coded
bug
so
that
there
is
not
this
widespread
public
dissemination
of
the
identity
of
the
printer
doing
political
work
for
particular
individual.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
texas
does
have
a
public
record
statute
and
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
certainly,
and
there
are
two
alternatives
that
i
think
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
it's
less
intrusive
for
two
reasons
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
texas
in
designing
such
a
coded
bug
system
could
very
well
put
in
some
sort
of
safeguards,
i'm
thinking
in
terms
of
the
bank
secrecy
act
case
for
example
where
such
information
would
not
be
available
except
on
the
showing
of
it
being
in
furtherance
of
or
necessary
to
achieve
one
of
these
legitimate
state
interests
which
has
been
expressed.
second
reason
is,
because
in
that
situation
you
would
have
only
the
person
who
was
legitimately
interested
in
ascertaining
that
information
for
whatever
purpose
or
reason
to
track
down
a
scurrilous
piece
of
campaign
literature
or
what
have
you
instead
of
every
single
person
who
receives
any
piece
of
political
advertising.
now,
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
oh,
i
certainly
think
that
that's
legitimate
state
interest.
now,
i
think
the
state
can
pursue
that
with
legitimate
state
interest
only
with
imbalance
which
do
not
transgress
first
amendment
rights
of
the
printers
or
anyone
else
for
that
matter.
and
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
yes.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
except
for
the
vagueness
argument
mr.
justice
brennan,
we're
only
assorting
the
rights
of
the
printers
in
this
particular
case.
now,
we
are
not
suggesting
necessarily
that
leaving
the
name
of
the
person
paying
for
the
advertising
is
constitutional.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
there
is
no
such
party
in
this
particular
lawsuit
mr.
justice
brennan.
this
is
the
lawsuit
that
is
used
not
before
the
court
in
this
particular
case,
but
another
less
restrictive
thing
that
texas
could
do
it
seems
to
us
would
be
to
pass
a
law,
making
it
the
illegal,
making
it
a
crime
to
put
out
falsely
attributed
campaign
literature
or
scurrilous
campaign
literature
or
libelous
campaign
literature
or
otherwise
to
prohibit
that.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
no
mr.
justice
marshall,
texas
does
not,
texas
did
have
a
criminal
libel
law
until
january
1,
1974
at
which
time
it
was
effectively
repealed
and
at
this
time
texas
has
no
law
making
it
a
crime
to
put
out
a
piece
of
so
called
campaign
dirty
tricks
in
any
form
or
fashion.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
well,
there
are
at
least
two
things
that
i
can
think
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
one
of
them
is
some
form
of
a
less
restrictive
printer
identification
requirement
such
as
the
coded
bug
systems,
such
as
requiring
that
the
printers
and
again
i
come
back
to
the
bank
secrecy
act
case
present
copies
of
their
political
advertising
to
the
secretary
of
state
who
has
a
copy
of
each
piece
of
political
advertising
there
in
his
office,
in
the
central
repository
sort
of
scheme.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
certainly
what
the
record
showing
who
the
printer
was
and
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
without
any
coded
bug
or
anything
else
on
the
material
itself.
another
thing
is
presumably
if
the
piece
of
campaign
material
is
false,
libelous
or
otherwise
a
subject
of
controversy
in
the
context
of
a
political
campaign
and
if
the
printer
knows
that
he
has
been
identified,
appropriately
the
state
officials
then
presumably
that
printer
may
well
come
forward
and
say
this
was
done
by
me.
i
was
the
person
who
printed
it
and
i
was
paid
for
--
it
was
paid
for
by
john
doe
or
whoever
else
happened
to
be
the
person
paying
for
it.
but
notice
mr.
justice
rehnquist
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
understand.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
probably
that
one
printer
and
that
one
case
would
be
but
all
of
the
other
printers
who
had
undertaken
to
do
political
advertising
for
various
individuals
would
not
be
exposed
to
the
great
extent,
to
the
devastating
extent
that
we
have
under
the
present
law.
all
the
printers
are
desirous
of
doing
is
isolating
the
infringement
on
their
constitutional
rights
if
you
will,
is
trying
to
tone
down
the
devastating
effect
of
this
1973
amendment.
i
might
point
out
or
through
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
mr.
justice
blackmun,
whenever
the
legislature
has
sought
to
achieve
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
a
manner
which
infringes
upon
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
then
the
legislature
may
do
that
only
in
the
way
which
is
the
least
restrictive
on
those
rights
only
in
a
way
which
is
absolutely
necessary
in
the
furtherance
of
the
achievement
of
that
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i'm
not
sure
that's
necessarily
the
case
because
obviously
texas
had
a
lot
of
imaginative
lawyers
working
on
this
particular
case
and
i
do
not
suggest
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
is
it
possible
to
achieve
what?
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
oh
i
certainly
don't
think
so
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
present
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
there
may
always
be
a
better
way
to
do
it.
in
each
case
the
court
must
consider
and
balance
whether
or
not
the
rights
which
have
been
infringed
upon
have
been
so
substantially
infringed
upon
that
some
less
restrictive
means
must
be
adopted
to
accomplish
the
legitimate
state
interest.
that's
what
we're
urging
so
easily
the
state
of
texas
could
have
done
and
could
do
in
this
very
case.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
certainly,
i
would
go
further
than
that
mr.
justice
stewart
and
say
if
there
were
no
other
reasonable
way
to
do
it
then
certainly
our
position
would
not
be
as
strong
as
it
is.
but
there
are
several
other
reasonable
ways
to
accomplish
each
of
these
legitimate
state
interests
without
burdening
the
printer's
rights
to
political
element.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
absolutely
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
yes,
well
yes
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
two
ways.
first
of
all,
i
will
address
the
court
to
the
very
lengthy
and
i
think
scholarly
dissertation
judge
singleton
on
that
precise
issue
with
all
of
his
citations
in
the
opinion
for
the
court
below
on
which
the
three
judges
unanimously
declared
the
law
unconstitutional.
secondly,
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
that's
certainly
true
and
the
result
of
course
mr.
justice
brennan
is
still
the
same
that
in
mr.
justice
bue's
opinion,
this
law
is
an
unconstitutional
infringement
on
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
of
the
printers,
he
certainly
did
not.
we
disagree
with
that
view.
understand
also
that
there
are
two
first
amendment
rights
that
we're
talking
about
here.
one
of
them
is
the
right
to
print
anonymously
and
i
think
that
is
the
issue
to
which
my
colleague
is
addressing
himself
and
suggesting
that
the
printers
have
no
such
right
that
they
are
merely
commercial
conduits
and
we
point
out
that
as
a
practical
matter
and
as
an
historical
matter,
if
the
printer,
if
the
person
who
operates
the
printing
press
does
not
have
first
amendment
protection
co-existent
with
that
enjoyed
by
the
author
that
the
whole
purpose
and
scheme
of
the
first
amendment
is
frustrated.
secondly,
however
and
the
issue
is
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
we
are
claiming
the
--
yes
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
right
to
undertake
to
print
what
we
choose
to
print
and
not
to
choose
what
we
don’t
want
to
print.
that
is
a
statement
of
our
name
and
address.
that
is
the
printer's
name
and
address.
that
raises
of
course
a
tornillo
type
issue
where
the
state
has
told
the
printers
you
must
print
your
name
and
address
on
political
advertising.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
by
the
way
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that's
only
to
the
extent
that
the
newspaper
desires
and
chooses
to
avail
itself
of
second
class
mailing
rights
and
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i
believe
the
case
that
upheld
that
law
is
lewis
publishing
company
versus
morgan
1913
case
and
that's
precisely
the
problem
is
that
mr.
justice
holme's
position
was
not
accepted
in
that
case.
that
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
congress
has
under
article
1,
section
8,
plenary
power
to
control
the
postal
service
and
therefore
anyone
choosing
or
desiring
to
avail
himself
of
lower
postal
rights,
lower
postal
rights
maybe
required
to
forgo
some
extent
first
amendment
rights.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i
certainly
think
it
has
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
well,
whether
the
point
vanishes,
the
point
is
that
there's
no
constitutional,
there
is
no
judicial
pronouncement
of
the
efficacy
of
that
law
that
exists
and
is
viable
today.
lamont
versus
postmaster
also
seems
to
suggested
that
that
1913
ruling
is
no
longer
viable
law.
i
would
ask
the
court,
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
political
advertising
in
texas
is
very
broadly
construed.
it’s
saying
anything
that
it's
any
form
of
expression,
anything
published
in
a
newspaper
magazine
or
journal
or
any
pamphlet,
handbill
or
other
printed
matter
or
anything
broadcast
over
a
radio
or
television
station
or
displayed
on
a
billboard
in
favor
of
or
in
opposition
to
any
candidate
for
public
office
or
office
of
a
political
party
or
in
favor
of
or
in
opposition
to
the
success
of
any
public
office
holder
or
in
favor
of
or
in
opposition
to
any
proposition
submitted
to
the
vote
of
