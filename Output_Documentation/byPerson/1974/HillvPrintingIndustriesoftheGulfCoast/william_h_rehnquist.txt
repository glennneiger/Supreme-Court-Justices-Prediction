when
was
that
law
enacted
in
its
present
form?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
was
this
lawsuit
brought?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
had
the
secretary
of
state
made
any
determination
or
have
made
any
public
announcement
is
to
how
he
construed
it
or
how
he
proposed
to
enforce
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
to
the
--
under
texas
libel
and
slander
law,
the
printer
might
be
liable
in
some
circumstances
for
printing
something
that
was
grossly
and
maliciously
false,
might
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
one
know
where
it
came
from,
if
you
simply
got
it
and
it
was
falsely
attributed
unless
there
was
some
requirement
like
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
[voice
overlap]
subject
to
the
same
reprisals
that
you
say
your
client
would
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
he
comes
forward
voluntarily
under
the
pressure
of
this
alternative
system
that
you
urge
won't
it
be
subject
to
the
same
sort
of
reprisals
that
you
say
your
client
is
under
the
existing
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
really
is
nonetheless
the
right
to
print
someone
else's
views
anonymously
that
you're
claiming?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
about
the
newspaper,
what
about
the
federal
statute
that
requires
a
newspaper,
every
newspaper,
they
print
the
name
of
the
publisher
and
so
forth.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
justice
holmes
long
ago
said
the
government
has
the
right
to
run
a
mail
service
but
it
doesn't
have
a
right
to
run
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
i
wouldn't
think
thatâ€™s
any
distinction?
