william
j.
brennan,

some
other
--
i
don't
know
what
these
statutes
include
them.
are
other
types
of
statutes
which
require
for
example,
an
indication
by
an
insignia
whether
or
not
the
printing
is
done
by
a
so
called
union
printer
if
that's
an
organized
printer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
texas
have
such
a
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
in
any
event,
if
there
are,
they're
independent
or
separately
from
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
nobody
but
others
could
turn
to
the
publication
of
libel
or
slander
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
no
but
the
idea
would
be
would
the
printer
want
to
be
cautious
about
whether
he
agrees
to
print
with
his
name
on
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
think
you
don't
argue
that
to
deter
the
publication
of
libelous
and
slanderous,
the
requirement
of
printing
the
printer's
name
on
the
publication
that
may
assist
them,
you
don't
argue
with
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
the
texas
have
on
the
statutes
required
comfortable
identification
of
television
or
commercials,
political
commercials
or
radio
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
newspapers
advertisements?
do
they
--
what
has
to
appear
on
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whether
it
simply
says
committee
for
john
jones,
that's
all
what
the
newspapers
varies
and
carries,
that
doesn't
tell
who
paid
for
the
advertisement,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
newspaper
have
to
keep
comparable
information?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
they
have
to
keep
the
same
kinds
of
records
the
printer
has.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
gather
that's
supposed
to
monitor
as
you
suggested
earlier
with
compliance
with
whatever
the
expenditure
laws
of
the
state
maybe
and
also
it's
possible
to
find
out
who
in
fact
is
behind
the
advertising.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
meaning
some
code
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
they
have
to
do
then,
they'd
be
required
to
register
or
take
it
with
some
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
get
number
or
a
button
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
argument
is
fully
on
behalf
of
the
printer
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
suggest
if
there's
anything
wrong
about
the
texas
requirement
that
there
appear
on
the
advertisement
on
itself,
the
name
of
the
person
who
paid
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
anyone
here
representing
originally
party
to
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
if
it
showing
who
the
printer
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
coded
bug
or
anything
else
on
the
material
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
a
judge
view
didn't
think
with
first
amendment
rights
in
printers
as
much
as
first
amendment
rights
of
those
who
were
responsible
for
having
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
he
didn't
think
the
one
with
first
amendment
rights
of
the
printer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
alternative
methods.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
the
state's
interest
all
piled
over
and
be
as
well
served
by
coded
