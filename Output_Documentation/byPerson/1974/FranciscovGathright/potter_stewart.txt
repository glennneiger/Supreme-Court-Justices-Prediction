and
the
state
court
had
already
rejected
your
search
and
seizure
issue?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
shepherd,
you
sought
up
to
bring
up
a
couple
of
times
the
larger
question
or
the
larger
position,
the
larger
claim
that
a
search
and
seizure
claim
is
simply
unavailable
on
federal
habeas
corpus
that
is
the
position
taken
by
mr.
justice
powell
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
schneckloth
against
bustamonte.
you
haven’t
develop
that
i
might
--
the
question
is
that
issue
really
here,
did
you
have
you
ever
brought
it
up
until
now
in
this
case?
i
mean
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
of
course
if
you're
--
if
the
claim
is
here,
if
you
should
prevail
on
that
claim
then
clearly
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
saying
in
not
reaching
the
claim
because
if
you're
correct
they
couldn’t
reach
the
claim.
they
wouldn’t
have
the
power
if
you
will.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
haven’t
made
that,
you
haven’t
take
that
position
in
this
litigation
until
now,
have
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don’t
really
in
your
brief
here?
justice
potter
stewart
brought
a
composition.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
haven’t
brief
to
that?
