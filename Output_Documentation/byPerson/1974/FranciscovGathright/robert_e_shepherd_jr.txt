mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
kaufman
has
pointed
out,
there
are
essentially
two
issues
involved
in
this
case.
the
first
relates
to
the
instructional
issue
which
was
based
on
a
virginia
statute
at
that
time
that
indicated
that
a
conviction
of
possession
of
drugs
could
be
based
solely
upon
evidence
as
to
the
quantity
of
that
drugs
conviction
of
possession
with
the
intent
to
distribute.
an
instruction
based
on
that
statute
was
given
in
this
case
in
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county.
i
might
point
out
that
the
objection
that
was
made
at
the
time
of
that
instruction
was
and
i
quote
from
page
129
of
the
transcript
of
trial
“we
object
to
instruction
‘g’
your
honor,
we
realized
that
this
is
merely
a
quotation
from
the
statutory
language.”
however,
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
instruction
does
not
in
any
way
guide
the
jurors
and
may
tend
to
confuse
them.
now,
this
is
not
in
the
appendix
--
this
portion
from
the
transcript.
subsequently,
in
other
words,
the
objection
at
that
point
was
on
the
basis
of
the
possible
vagueness
of
the
instruction
or
on
the
basis
the
instruction
might
tend
to
confuse
the
jurors
rather
than
really
guide
them.
when
the
petition
for
appeal
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
the
nature
of
the
issue
had
somehow
been
re-characterized
and
it
was
then
based
on
the
several
federal
constitutional
issues
including
the
validity
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
instruction
was
based
on
the
basis
of
vagueness
and
also
on
the
basis
of
this
court’s
decision
in
leary
versus
united
states
in
that
it
was
an
impermissibly
unconstitutional
presumption.
so
we
would
submit
that
even
initially
there
might
be
some
threshold
question
of
exhaustion
as
to
in
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
picard
versus
connor
based
on
whether
the
federal
constitutional
issue
was
ever
precisely
presented
to
the
virginia
courts.
in
other
words,
the
virginia
supreme
court
takes
the
position
that
the
only
issues
that
will
be
dealt
with
be
effectively
on
appeal
are
issues
that
were
properly
and
timely
raised
at
the
trial.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
yes,
it
was.
consequently,
we
deal
with
that
initial
threshold
question
as
to
whether
there
was
exhaustion
despite
an
incomplete
ignorance
of
the
issue
based
on
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
subsequent
decision
in
sharp.
however,
let's
turn
to
that
aspect
of
it.
the
sharp
case
as
mr.
kaufman
pointed
out
the
virginia
decision
--
decision
of
virginia
supreme
court
in
sharp
was
based
on
state
law
relative
to
vagueness
in
a
statute
and
it
was
also
based
on
the
leary
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
state
constitutional
law
as
to
vagueness
--
the
court
does
not
specifically
delineate
where
it’s
basing
its
decision
on
federal
constitutional
law
and
where
on
state
constitutional
law
but
it
is
clearly
dealing
with
the
issue
on
a
mixed
basis,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
yes
sir,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
and
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
issue
on
search
and
seizure
was
properly
raised
and
properly
characterized
both
at
the
state
level
and
the
lower
courts
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
a
writ
of
error
was
denied
as
to
both
issues
which
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
is
considered
to
be
a
ruling
on
the
merits
--
the
order
denying
a
writ
of
error
states
that
it
is
denied
for
the
reason
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
is
plainly
right.
the
petitioner
then
filed
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
and
alexandria
raising
principally
these
two
issues
as
mr.
kaufman
has
pointed
out
the
sharp
decision
intervened
before
the
district
court
dealt
with
this
case
and
the
district
court
took
the
position
that
the
intervening
decision
in
sharp
necessitated
that
the
petitioner
exhaust
his
available
state
court
remedies
with
regard
to
the
instructional
issue.
in
that,
this
intervening
decision
did
present
a
new
state
of
law
and
the
virginia
courts
quite
possibly
and
perhaps
probably
would
feel
compelled
to
grant
petitioning
a
new
trial
based
on
the
intervening
decision
in
sharp
versus
commonwealth.
the
district
court
though
did
proceed
to
deal
with
the
search
and
seizure
issue
on
the
merits
and
rule
that
the
issue
did
not
have
any
validity
that
the
search
and
seizure
in
this
case
was
indeed
proper
and
that
the
evidence
was
properly
admissible.
the
district
court
took
the
somewhat
unusual
procedural
stands
that
as
to
the
unexhausted
instructional
issue
--
the
burden
was
on
the
respondent
represented
by
the
attorney
general’s
office
to
present
the
issue
to
the
state
courts
in
some
manner
for
a
re-adjudication
of
the
sharp
issue.
the
respondent
of
course
objected
to
this
procedure
on
the
basis
that
the
rational
of
28
united
states
code
section
2254
with
regard
to
its
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
available
state
court
remedies
places
that
burden
of
exhausting
the
state
court
remedies
on
the
petitioner.
but
nevertheless
and
in
the
absence
of
any
real
guidance
is
to
what
procedure
the
state
could
take
to
initiate
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
the
attorney
general’s
office
did
attempt
to
initiate
proceedings
in
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county.
the
circuit
court
was
likewise
had
some
laws
as
to
what
sort
of
procedure
could
be
initiated
either
by
the
court
or
by
the
commonwealth
and
the
decision
was
made
to
send
habeas
corpus
forms
to
the
petitioner
and
advise
how
they
should
be
prepared
and
the
petitioner
ignored
this
communication
and
the
court
subsequently
in
spite
of
this
appointed
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
brought
the
matter
forward
for
a
hearing.
at
that
point
mr.
kaufman
who
have
been
involved
in
this
case
for
some
time
and
still
has
appeared
at
the
hearing
along
with
court-appointed
counsel
and
the
court
attempted
in
some
detail
to
urge
the
petitioner
to
present
the
case
forward
for
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
a
new
trial
was
required
and
if
petitioner
took
the
position
that
he
did
not
want
to
present
the
issue
to
the
court.
now,
whatever
happens
to
this
case
in
the
future
i
think
a
substantial
issue
may
have
been
raised
at
this
point
as
to
deliberate
bypass
of
state
procedures
in
so
far
as
that
instructional
issue
is
concerned.
the
petitioner
was
certainly
given
an
opportunity.
the
court
addressed
itself
both
to
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
to
petitioner
directly
and
they
were
advised
i
think
in
terms
that
would
meet
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
standard
as
to
an
intelligent
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver.
they
made
the
decision
not
to
proceed
further
on
the
instructional
issue.
meanwhile,
the
case
was
wending
its
way
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
do
you
mean
as
to
the
instructional
issue
as
to
whether
we
would
make
to
lower
the
case
that
there
has
been
a
deliberate
bypass?
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
issue
would
have
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
they
didn’t
come
in
there
voluntarily
in
the
sense
that
they
did
not
initiate
the
proceeding.
however,
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
they
objected
to
the
proceeding,
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
technically
submitted
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
they
filed
nothing.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
of
course
we
have
that
question
in
the
first
instance
as
to
why
the
burden
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
why
the
burden
was
placed
on
us.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
right,
and
of
course
we
felt
to
that
procedure
was
not
the
appropriate
one
but
nevertheless
we
proceeded
on
the
basis
of
what
we
have
been
directed
to
do
by
the
federal
district
court
judge.
it
may
present
if
this
case
works
its
way
back
down,
it
may
present
an
interesting
issue
at
that
point
as
to
whether
it
be
considered
a
deliberate
bypass.
but
in
the
case
came
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
they
of
course
agreed
with
the
district
court’s
disposition
of
the
instructional
issue
feeling
that
the
petitioner
had
not
properly
exhausted
his
available
state
court
remedies
in
light
of
the
intervening
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
but
the
court,
somewhat
of
its
own
motion
took
the
position
that
the
district
court
should
not
also
have
ruled
on
the
search
and
seizure
issue
and
that
the
case
was
going
back
to
the
state
courts
and
the
disposition
of
the
instructional
issue
could
in
fact
be
dispositive
of
the
entire
case.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
that's
an
argument
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
not
completely
sure
that's
fourth
circuit
was
even
aware.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
probably
so
and
of
course
that
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
correct,
but
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
think
that
question
was
squarely
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
no,
not
really
at
this
point
because
i
think
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
this
court
has
to
probably
deal
with
the
issues
as
they
were
before
the
fourth
circuit.
i
think
the
question
of
deliberate
bypass
may
have
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
in
the
state
court
ultimately,
initially
and
perhaps
ultimately
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
of
course
then
we
get
into
the
question
procedural
sequencing
you
know
it
appears
to
me
that
the
federal
courts
would
have
to
deal
with
the
question
of
exhaustion
including
the
deliberate
bypass
argument
before
they
could
deal
properly
with
the
search
and
seizure
question.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
that’s
correct
and
i
certainly
would
not
want
to
waive
that
position
at
this
point.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
i
think
he
has
to
go
back
and
face
the
question.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
it
was
certainly
a
procedural
decision
that
he
had
to
make
at
the
time
of
that
hearing
and
the
circuit
court
in
fairfax
county.
he
very
easily
and
i
think
the
tone
of
that
hearing
indicated
that
the
judge
of
circuit
court
--
the
state
court
would
have
been
inclined
to
--
the
question
was
put
to
him
in
the
sense
of
if
a
new
trial
were
ordered
would
you
cooperate?
and
he
said,
no
and
that
they
felt
that
it
would
be
double
jeopardy.
of
course
going
back
to
the
fourth
circuit’s
decision
on
the
search
and
seizure
issue,
we
would
take
the
position
at
this
point
that
if
the
court
wants
to
deal
with
the
procedural
aspects
of
a
search
and
seizure
issue
than
we
feel
that
that
issue
should
be
addressed
in
a
context
of
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
schneckloth
versus
bustamonte
as
to
whether
the
search
and
seizure
issue
itself
should
in
fact
appropriately
be
dealt
with
on
federal
habeas
corpus
without
a
determination
of
the
narrow
context
as
to
whether
mr.
francisco
had
been
afforded
a
fair
opportunity
to
raise
the
federal
constitutional
issues
and
have
that
question
adjudicated
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
feel
that
roberts
against
lavallee
is
perhaps
a
decision
of
somewhat
narrower
boundaries
than
this
decision
the
issue
involved
in
roberts
was
whether
the
petitioner
in
that
case
as
an
indigent
was
entitled
to
a
free
transcript
of
the
preliminary
hearing
just
as
a
pecunious
defendant
would
have
been.
this
court
dealt
with
that
case
on
a
per
curiam
basis.
we
submit
that
the
roberts
issue
was
in
fact
a
narrow
procedural
point
--
the
right
to
transcript
of
the
preliminary
hearing
really
was
not
a
substantive
issue
in
the
sense
that
this
instructional
issue
is
a
substantive
issue.
we
submit
that
we’re
dealing
here
with
a
question
that
may
in
fact
be
dispositive
of
the
entire
substance
of
the
case
and
it’s
not
merely
a
procedural
point
as
to
whether
person
was
entitled
to
a
transcript
or
something
of
a
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
assume
unless
the
state
court
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
unless
the
state
court
were
to
make
a
new
determinant.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
correct
and
i
think
mr.
kaufman
is
correct
and
that
the
state
courts
would
not
re-adjudicate
the
search
and
seizure
issue
after
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
denied
a
writ
of
error.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
the
results
maybe
the
same,
the
court
really
did
not
address
all
of
the
issue
in
roberts
--
i
don’t
believe
the
case
was
--
i'm
not
sure
with
the
case
was
brief
and
argued
it
was
a
per
curiam
decision
that
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
appear
to
have
been
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
it
was
a
per
curiam
opinion
that
dealt
fairly
narrowly
with
the
issue
as
to
the
availability
of
the
transcript
and
the
right
to
access
to
the
transcript.
the
court
did
not
deal
too
broadly
with
the
procedural
habeas
corpus
issue
and
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
the
problem
we
have
here
of
course
is
that
the
resolution
of
that
question
was
somewhat
dispositive
in
that
case
procedurally.
here,
we've
got
an
initial
issue
for
example
as
to
whether
the
instruction
could’ve
been
harmless
error.
in
other
words,
there
would
be
an
opportunity
for
a
factual
hearing
in
this
case
as
to
whether
even
the
granting
of
the
instruction
was
error
such
as
to
require
a
new
trial.
now,
this
was
the
one
of
the
basic
reasons
for
the
state
courts
having
an
opportunity
to
re-adjudicate
the
issue
in
light
of
sharp.
for
example
in
this
case
there
was
affirmative
evidence
at
the
trial
not
only
of
an
intent
to
distribute
but
of
an
actual
distribution
of
the
heroin
in
this
case.
as
a
consequence,
the
court
could
conclude
after
an
evidentiary
hearings
that
the
giving
of
the
sharp
instruction
for
one
or
better
terminology
is
a
short
hand
--
the
giving
of
the
sharp
instruction
was
in
fact
harmless
error
because
there
were
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
of
actual
distribution.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that
was
my
impression
mr.
justice
marshall
because
i
feel
that
the
court
has
in
the
last
few
years
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
don’t
try
and
get
an
awful
out
of
that.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
although,
i
think
the
court
has
been
inclined
in
the
last
few
years
to
deal
with
some
of
the
procedural
aspects
of
federal
habeas
corpus
and
a
good
deal
more
detail
than
it
had
during
the
period
in
which
the
roberts
case
was
decided.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
my
opinion,
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
true.
your
honor
as
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case
is
plainly
correct
that
the
court
was
proper
in
saying
that
the
issue
of
search
and
seizure
should
not
be
decided
by
the
state
courts
in
light
of
the
disposition
that
was
being
made
of
the
sharp
instructional
issue.
if
the
court
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
assuming
that
there
had
been
exhaustion
we
would
take
the
position
that
they
should
not
reach
the
search
and
seizure
issue
at
all.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that
kaufman
is
still
liable?
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
probably
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
obviously,
if
the
evidence
has
to
the
search
and
seizure
is
excluded,
i
think
that's
in
a
sense
dispositive
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
but,
in
light
of
the
action
that
the
district
court
had
taken
on
the
instructional
issue
and
in
light
of
the
fourth
circuit’s
view
that
that
was
the
correct
disposition
for
the
court
to
then
deal
with
the
search
and
seizure
issue
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
--
would
be
to
in
a
fact
dealing
with
a
pretrial
of
federal
habeas
corpus
giving
an
advisory
opinion
prior
to
what
might
very
well
be
a
new
state
trial.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
that
would’ve
been
a
much
easier
road
to
travel
but
as
to
whether
it
would’ve
been
and
appropriate
or
a
proper
road,
i
think
it’s
an
entirely
different
question.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
or
whether
it’s
error
if
it
didn’t.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
don
think
either
of
the
courts
expressed
any
view
on
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
it’s
really
hard
for
me
to
even
say
at
this
point
what
other
available
evidence
there
might
be
because
it’s
a
local
commonwealth’s
attorney
that
actually
tries
the
cases
and
we
merely
handle
the
appellate
in
collateral
proceedings.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
it
would
--
i
think
it
[laughter]
would
be
very,
very
difficult
conceivably
in
this
case,
they
might
have
received
it
purely
on
the
testimony
of
the
informer
as
to
whether
he
was
able
to
express
the
facts
that
it
was
really
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
they
probably
could
have
passed
on
both
and
in
fact
in
the
passed
as
counsel
for
the
petitioners
pointed
out,
they
have
done
so
in
hewett
versus
north
carolina.
they
dealt
with
an
exhausted
issue
and
exhausted
issues
and
dealt
with
the
merits
of
both
issues.
but
i
don’t
think
that
their
refusal
to
do
so
amounts
to
such
an
abuse
of
their
discretion
as
to
constitute
reversible
error
in
this
court.
and
i
think
that
it’s
a
matter
that
should
be
left
with
the
courts
and
the
exercise
of
their
discretion.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
it’s
ever
directly
been
brought
up
and
as
to
whether
it’s
properly
before
the
court
at
this
point
and
in
matter
of
fact
as
to
whether
the
substance
of
the
issue
is
even
before
the
court.
we’re
dealing
more
with
the
procedural
niceties
surrounding
the
substantive
issues
without
dealing
with
the
substantive
issue
directly.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
no,
the
schneckloth
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
schneckloth
is
cited
but
it
is
not
cited
for
that
purpose.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
right.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
no,
that’s
correct.
it
has
not
been
briefed
because
we
did
not
feel
that
the
substantive
issue
itself
was
before
the
court.
it
was
more
the
question
of
derivative
of
exhaustion
argument
as
phrased
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
mr.
kaufman
has
pointed
out,
there
are
essentially
two
issues
involved
in
this
case.
the
first
relates
to
the
instructional
issue
which
was
based
on
a
virginia
statute
at
that
time
that
indicated
that
a
conviction
of
possession
of
drugs
could
be
based
solely
upon
evidence
as
to
the
quantity
of
that
drugs
conviction
of
possession
with
the
intent
to
distribute.
an
instruction
based
on
that
statute
was
given
in
this
case
in
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county.
i
might
point
out
that
the
objection
that
was
made
at
the
time
of
that
instruction
was
and
i
quote
from
page
129
of
the
transcript
of
trial
“we
object
to
instruction
‘g’
your
honor,
we
realized
that
this
is
merely
a
quotation
from
the
statutory
language.”
however,
it
is
my
opinion
that
this
instruction
does
not
in
any
way
guide
the
jurors
and
may
tend
to
confuse
them.
now,
this
is
not
in
the
appendix
--
this
portion
from
the
transcript.
subsequently,
in
other
words,
the
objection
at
that
point
was
on
the
basis
of
the
possible
vagueness
of
the
instruction
or
on
the
basis
the
instruction
might
tend
to
confuse
the
jurors
rather
than
really
guide
them.
when
the
petition
for
appeal
was
filed
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
the
nature
of
the
issue
had
somehow
been
re-characterized
and
it
was
then
based
on
the
several
federal
constitutional
issues
including
the
validity
of
the
statute
upon
which
the
instruction
was
based
on
the
basis
of
vagueness
and
also
on
the
basis
of
this
court’s
decision
in
leary
versus
united
states
in
that
it
was
an
impermissibly
unconstitutional
presumption.
so
we
would
submit
that
even
initially
there
might
be
some
threshold
question
of
exhaustion
as
to
in
light
of
this
court’s
decision
in
picard
versus
connor
based
on
whether
the
federal
constitutional
issue
was
ever
precisely
presented
to
the
virginia
courts.
in
other
words,
the
virginia
supreme
court
takes
the
position
that
the
only
issues
that
will
be
dealt
with
be
effectively
on
appeal
are
issues
that
were
properly
and
timely
raised
at
the
trial.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
yes,
it
was.
consequently,
we
deal
with
that
initial
threshold
question
as
to
whether
there
was
exhaustion
despite
an
incomplete
ignorance
of
the
issue
based
on
the
virginia
supreme
court’s
subsequent
decision
in
sharp.
however,
let's
turn
to
that
aspect
of
it.
the
sharp
case
as
mr.
kaufman
pointed
out
the
virginia
decision
--
decision
of
virginia
supreme
court
in
sharp
was
based
on
state
law
relative
to
vagueness
in
a
statute
and
it
was
also
based
on
the
leary
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
state
constitutional
law
as
to
vagueness
--
the
court
does
not
specifically
delineate
where
it’s
basing
its
decision
on
federal
constitutional
law
and
where
on
state
constitutional
law
but
it
is
clearly
dealing
with
the
issue
on
a
mixed
basis,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
yes
sir,
your
honor.
the
petitioner
and
there's
no
question
about
the
fact
that
the
issue
on
search
and
seizure
was
properly
raised
and
properly
characterized
both
at
the
state
level
and
the
lower
courts
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
a
writ
of
error
was
denied
as
to
both
issues
which
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
is
considered
to
be
a
ruling
on
the
merits
--
the
order
denying
a
writ
of
error
states
that
it
is
denied
for
the
reason
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
is
plainly
right.
the
petitioner
then
filed
his
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
and
alexandria
raising
principally
these
two
issues
as
mr.
kaufman
has
pointed
out
the
sharp
decision
intervened
before
the
district
court
dealt
with
this
case
and
the
district
court
took
the
position
that
the
intervening
decision
in
sharp
necessitated
that
the
petitioner
exhaust
his
available
state
court
remedies
with
regard
to
the
instructional
issue.
in
that,
this
intervening
decision
did
present
a
new
state
of
law
and
the
virginia
courts
quite
possibly
and
perhaps
probably
would
feel
compelled
to
grant
petitioning
a
new
trial
based
on
the
intervening
decision
in
sharp
versus
commonwealth.
the
district
court
though
did
proceed
to
deal
with
the
search
and
seizure
issue
on
the
merits
and
rule
that
the
issue
did
not
have
any
validity
that
the
search
and
seizure
in
this
case
was
indeed
proper
and
that
the
evidence
was
properly
admissible.
the
district
court
took
the
somewhat
unusual
procedural
stands
that
as
to
the
unexhausted
instructional
issue
--
the
burden
was
on
the
respondent
represented
by
the
attorney
general’s
office
to
present
the
issue
to
the
state
courts
in
some
manner
for
a
re-adjudication
of
the
sharp
issue.
the
respondent
of
course
objected
to
this
procedure
on
the
basis
that
the
rational
of
28
united
states
code
section
2254
with
regard
to
its
requirement
of
exhaustion
of
available
state
court
remedies
places
that
burden
of
exhausting
the
state
court
remedies
on
the
petitioner.
but
nevertheless
and
in
the
absence
of
any
real
guidance
is
to
what
procedure
the
state
could
take
to
initiate
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
the
attorney
general’s
office
did
attempt
to
initiate
proceedings
in
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county.
the
circuit
court
was
likewise
had
some
laws
as
to
what
sort
of
procedure
could
be
initiated
either
by
the
court
or
by
the
commonwealth
and
the
decision
was
made
to
send
habeas
corpus
forms
to
the
petitioner
and
advise
how
they
should
be
prepared
and
the
petitioner
ignored
this
communication
and
the
court
subsequently
in
spite
of
this
appointed
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
brought
the
matter
forward
for
a
hearing.
at
that
point
mr.
kaufman
who
have
been
involved
in
this
case
for
some
time
and
still
has
appeared
at
the
hearing
along
with
court-appointed
counsel
and
the
court
attempted
in
some
detail
to
urge
the
petitioner
to
present
the
case
forward
for
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
a
new
trial
was
required
and
if
petitioner
took
the
position
that
he
did
not
want
to
present
the
issue
to
the
court.
now,
whatever
happens
to
this
case
in
the
future
i
think
a
substantial
issue
may
have
been
raised
at
this
point
as
to
deliberate
bypass
of
state
procedures
in
so
far
as
that
instructional
issue
is
concerned.
the
petitioner
was
certainly
given
an
opportunity.
the
court
addressed
itself
both
to
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
to
petitioner
directly
and
they
were
advised
i
think
in
terms
that
would
meet
the
johnson
versus
zerbst
standard
as
to
an
intelligent
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver.
they
made
the
decision
not
to
proceed
further
on
the
instructional
issue.
meanwhile,
the
case
was
wending
its
way
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
do
you
mean
as
to
the
instructional
issue
as
to
whether
we
would
make
to
lower
the
case
that
there
has
been
a
deliberate
bypass?
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
issue
would
have
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
they
didn’t
come
in
there
voluntarily
in
the
sense
that
they
did
not
initiate
the
proceeding.
however,
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
they
objected
to
the
proceeding,
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
technically
submitted
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
they
filed
nothing.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
of
course
we
have
that
question
in
the
first
instance
as
to
why
the
burden
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
why
the
burden
was
placed
on
us.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
right,
and
of
course
we
felt
to
that
procedure
was
not
the
appropriate
one
but
nevertheless
we
proceeded
on
the
basis
of
what
we
have
been
directed
to
do
by
the
federal
district
court
judge.
it
may
present
if
this
case
works
its
way
back
down,
it
may
present
an
interesting
issue
at
that
point
as
to
whether
it
be
considered
a
deliberate
bypass.
but
in
the
case
came
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
they
of
course
agreed
with
the
district
court’s
disposition
of
the
instructional
issue
feeling
that
the
petitioner
had
not
properly
exhausted
his
available
state
court
remedies
in
light
of
the
intervening
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
but
the
court,
somewhat
of
its
own
motion
took
the
position
that
the
district
court
should
not
also
have
ruled
on
the
search
and
seizure
issue
and
that
the
case
was
going
back
to
the
state
courts
and
the
disposition
of
the
instructional
issue
could
in
fact
be
dispositive
of
the
entire
case.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
that's
an
argument
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
not
completely
sure
that's
fourth
circuit
was
even
aware.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
probably
so
and
of
course
that
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
correct,
but
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
think
that
question
was
squarely
before
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
no,
not
really
at
this
point
because
i
think
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
this
court
has
to
probably
deal
with
the
issues
as
they
were
before
the
fourth
circuit.
i
think
the
question
of
deliberate
bypass
may
have
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
in
the
state
court
ultimately,
initially
and
perhaps
ultimately
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
of
course
then
we
get
into
the
question
procedural
sequencing
you
know
it
appears
to
me
that
the
federal
courts
would
have
to
deal
with
the
question
of
exhaustion
including
the
deliberate
bypass
argument
before
they
could
deal
properly
with
the
search
and
seizure
question.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
that’s
correct
and
i
certainly
would
not
want
to
waive
that
position
at
this
point.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
i
think
he
has
to
go
back
and
face
the
question.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
it
was
certainly
a
procedural
decision
that
he
had
to
make
at
the
time
of
that
hearing
and
the
circuit
court
in
fairfax
county.
he
very
easily
and
i
think
the
tone
of
that
hearing
indicated
that
the
judge
of
circuit
court
--
the
state
court
would
have
been
inclined
to
--
the
question
was
put
to
him
in
the
sense
of
if
a
new
trial
were
ordered
would
you
cooperate?
and
he
said,
no
and
that
they
felt
that
it
would
be
double
jeopardy.
of
course
going
back
to
the
fourth
circuit’s
decision
on
the
search
and
seizure
issue,
we
would
take
the
position
at
this
point
that
if
the
court
wants
to
deal
with
the
procedural
aspects
of
a
search
and
seizure
issue
than
we
feel
that
that
issue
should
be
addressed
in
a
context
of
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
schneckloth
versus
bustamonte
as
to
whether
the
search
and
seizure
issue
itself
should
in
fact
appropriately
be
dealt
with
on
federal
habeas
corpus
without
a
determination
of
the
narrow
context
as
to
whether
mr.
francisco
had
been
afforded
a
fair
opportunity
to
raise
the
federal
constitutional
issues
and
have
that
question
adjudicated
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
feel
that
roberts
against
lavallee
is
perhaps
a
decision
of
somewhat
narrower
boundaries
than
this
decision
the
issue
involved
in
roberts
was
whether
the
petitioner
in
that
case
as
an
indigent
was
entitled
to
a
free
transcript
of
the
preliminary
hearing
just
as
a
pecunious
defendant
would
have
been.
this
court
dealt
with
that
case
on
a
per
curiam
basis.
we
submit
that
the
roberts
issue
was
in
fact
a
narrow
procedural
point
--
the
right
to
transcript
of
the
preliminary
hearing
really
was
not
a
substantive
issue
in
the
sense
that
this
instructional
issue
is
a
substantive
issue.
we
submit
that
we’re
dealing
here
with
a
question
that
may
in
fact
be
dispositive
of
the
entire
substance
of
the
case
and
it’s
not
merely
a
procedural
point
as
to
whether
person
was
entitled
to
a
transcript
or
something
of
a
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
assume
unless
the
state
court
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
unless
the
state
court
were
to
make
a
new
determinant.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
correct
and
i
think
mr.
kaufman
is
correct
and
that
the
state
courts
would
not
re-adjudicate
the
search
and
seizure
issue
after
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
denied
a
writ
of
error.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
the
results
maybe
the
same,
the
court
really
did
not
address
all
of
the
issue
in
roberts
--
i
don’t
believe
the
case
was
--
i'm
not
sure
with
the
case
was
brief
and
argued
it
was
a
per
curiam
decision
that
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
appear
to
have
been
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
it
was
a
per
curiam
opinion
that
dealt
fairly
narrowly
with
the
issue
as
to
the
availability
of
the
transcript
and
the
right
to
access
to
the
transcript.
the
court
did
not
deal
too
broadly
with
the
procedural
habeas
corpus
issue
and
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
the
problem
we
have
here
of
course
is
that
the
resolution
of
that
question
was
somewhat
dispositive
in
that
case
procedurally.
here,
we've
got
an
initial
issue
for
example
as
to
whether
the
instruction
could’ve
been
harmless
error.
in
other
words,
there
would
be
an
opportunity
for
a
factual
hearing
in
this
case
as
to
whether
even
the
granting
of
the
instruction
was
error
such
as
to
require
a
new
trial.
now,
this
was
the
one
of
the
basic
reasons
for
the
state
courts
having
an
opportunity
to
re-adjudicate
the
issue
in
light
of
sharp.
for
example
in
this
case
there
was
affirmative
evidence
at
the
trial
not
only
of
an
intent
to
distribute
but
of
an
actual
distribution
of
the
heroin
in
this
case.
as
a
consequence,
the
court
could
conclude
after
an
evidentiary
hearings
that
the
giving
of
the
sharp
instruction
for
one
or
better
terminology
is
a
short
hand
--
the
giving
of
the
sharp
instruction
was
in
fact
harmless
error
because
there
were
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
of
actual
distribution.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that
was
my
impression
mr.
justice
marshall
because
i
feel
that
the
court
has
in
the
last
few
years
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
sir?
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
don’t
try
and
get
an
awful
out
of
that.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
although,
i
think
the
court
has
been
inclined
in
the
last
few
years
to
deal
with
some
of
the
procedural
aspects
of
federal
habeas
corpus
and
a
good
deal
more
detail
than
it
had
during
the
period
in
which
the
roberts
case
was
decided.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
my
opinion,
yes.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that’s
true.
your
honor
as
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
case
is
plainly
correct
that
the
court
was
proper
in
saying
that
the
issue
of
search
and
seizure
should
not
be
decided
by
the
state
courts
in
light
of
the
disposition
that
was
being
made
of
the
sharp
instructional
issue.
if
the
court
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
assuming
that
there
had
been
exhaustion
we
would
take
the
position
that
they
should
not
reach
the
search
and
seizure
issue
at
all.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that
kaufman
is
still
liable?
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
probably
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
obviously,
if
the
evidence
has
to
the
search
and
seizure
is
excluded,
i
think
that's
in
a
sense
dispositive
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
but,
in
light
of
the
action
that
the
district
court
had
taken
on
the
instructional
issue
and
in
light
of
the
fourth
circuit’s
view
that
that
was
the
correct
disposition
for
the
court
to
then
deal
with
the
search
and
seizure
issue
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
--
would
be
to
in
a
fact
dealing
with
a
pretrial
of
federal
habeas
corpus
giving
an
advisory
opinion
prior
to
what
might
very
well
be
a
new
state
trial.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
that
would’ve
been
a
much
easier
road
to
travel
but
as
to
whether
it
would’ve
been
and
appropriate
or
a
proper
road,
i
think
it’s
an
entirely
different
question.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
or
whether
it’s
error
if
it
didn’t.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
don
think
either
of
the
courts
expressed
any
view
on
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
it’s
really
hard
for
me
to
even
say
at
this
point
what
other
available
evidence
there
might
be
because
it’s
a
local
commonwealth’s
attorney
that
actually
tries
the
cases
and
we
merely
handle
the
appellate
in
collateral
proceedings.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
it
would
--
i
think
it
[laughter]
would
be
very,
very
difficult
conceivably
in
this
case,
they
might
have
received
it
purely
on
the
testimony
of
the
informer
as
to
whether
he
was
able
to
express
the
facts
that
it
was
really
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i
think
they
probably
could
have
passed
on
both
and
in
fact
in
the
passed
as
counsel
for
the
petitioners
pointed
out,
they
have
done
so
in
hewett
versus
north
carolina.
they
dealt
with
an
exhausted
issue
and
exhausted
issues
and
dealt
with
the
merits
of
both
issues.
but
i
don’t
think
that
their
refusal
to
do
so
amounts
to
such
an
abuse
of
their
discretion
as
to
constitute
reversible
error
in
this
court.
and
i
think
that
it’s
a
matter
that
should
be
left
with
the
courts
and
the
exercise
of
their
discretion.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
it’s
ever
directly
been
brought
up
and
as
to
whether
it’s
properly
before
the
court
at
this
point
and
in
matter
of
fact
as
to
whether
the
substance
of
the
issue
is
even
before
the
court.
we’re
dealing
more
with
the
procedural
niceties
surrounding
the
substantive
issues
without
dealing
with
the
substantive
issue
directly.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
no,
the
schneckloth
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
schneckloth
is
cited
but
it
is
not
cited
for
that
purpose.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
right.
mr.
robert
e.
shepherd,
jr.
no,
that’s
correct.
it
has
not
been
briefed
because
we
did
not
feel
that
the
substantive
issue
itself
was
before
the
court.
it
was
more
the
question
of
derivative
of
exhaustion
argument
as
phrased
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
