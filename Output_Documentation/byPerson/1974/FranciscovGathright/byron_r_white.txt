mr.
kaufman,
is
mr.
francisco
--
where
is
he
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
had
gone
here,
might
not
the
whole
thing
have
been
resolved
by
this
time,
he
won’t
have
to
be
in
jail?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
a
man’s
liberty
is
at
stake
in
(inaudible)
and
after
all
you
can
judge
a
no
(inaudible)
if
you
like
to
take
it
from
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
just
wondering
if
you
aren't
misdemeaning
a
man’s
freedom
is
just
for
very
nice
people
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
roberts
cited
to
the
district
court
and
the
fourth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
incidentally,
was
the
federal
habeas
petition
filed
after
sharp
was
decided
or
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless,
the
decision
was
made
to
go
into
federal
court
rather
than
a
state
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
--
you're
suggesting
or
you
say
there's
an
argument,
it
could
be
made
that
there's
a
deliberate
bypass
of
the
instructional
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
sense
that
the
defendant
is
going
forward
and
would
be
precluded
by
deliberate
bypass
or
many
remedy
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
--
in
which
event
of
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
would
be
--
would
have
been
wrong
not
to
reach
the
fourth
amendment
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
there
was
a
deliberate
bypass
that
means
there
would
be
no
remedy
available
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
the
fourth
amendment
issue
is
squarely
on
the
table?
justice
byron
r.
white
probably
it
would
be,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
you
make
deliberate
bypass
in
that
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
putting
it
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
would.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
defendant
is
going
to
face
that
kind
of
argument
from
you
in
the
state
court
which
apparently
he
is
at
least
that’s
another
argument
for
having
a
ruling
in
the
federal
court
on
the
search
and
seizure?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nobody
could
ever
have
to
deal
with
it
unless
you
raised
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
nevertheless
argue
he
must
go
back
and
face
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
he
can
come
back
to
court
on
the
search
and
seizure
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
virginia
--
suppose
the
state
courts
have
not
changed
their
mind,
suppose
there
hadn't
been
any
change
in
the
state
law
and
the
issue
then
presented
of
both
state
court
to
the
state
court
turned
down
no
question
of
exhaustion
and
the
two
issues
are
presented
to
the
federal
district
court
and
to
the
federal
court
of
appeals,
which
issue
would
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
should
reach?
you
don’t
think
they
should
reach
both,
but
which
one
should
they
reach
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that’s
to
the
court,
do
you
think
that
and
not
available
--
now,
let's
assume
the
law
state
the
way
it
is
namely
that
that
you
do
reach
those.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
the
search
and
seizure
issue
is
much
more
like,
it
is
going
to
have
a
greater
impact
on
the
trial
than
the
instructional
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
shouldn’t
the
fourth
circuit
have
dealt
with
search
and
seizure
issue
first
and
that
it
sustained
that
the
trial
--
the
case
was
over
and
that
that
turn
it
down
and
then
they
sent
it
back
to
case
to
the
virginia
courts
on
the
instructional
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
whether
it’s
error,
if
it
didn’t?
justice
byron
