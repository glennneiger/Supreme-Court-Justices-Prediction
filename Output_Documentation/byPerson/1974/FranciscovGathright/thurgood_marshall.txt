justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
win
here,
wouldn’t
the
state
have
a
right
to
retry?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
that
it
went
through
the
state
court
could
not
the
district
court
still
have
held
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you're
going
back
in
the
state
court,
how
would
that
a
prejudice
to
federal
court
proceeding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
not
talking
about
that,
i'm
saying
when
the
state
court
matter
was
attempted
to
be
opened
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
were
going
to
the
state
court
and
had
lost,
would
you
been
any
worse
off
than
you
are
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
on
the
other
hand
if
you've
gone
to
state
court
and
won,
you
would’ve
been
better
off
than
you
are
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright.
did
you
hear
what
i
said
you
went
to
the
state
court
and
won?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
man
was
turned
loose,
wouldn’t
you
be
better
off
than
you
are
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
he
was
turned
loose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
might
be
better
off.
why
didn’t
you
do
it,
why
didn’t
you
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
you
didn’t
think
he
could
win?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
going
to
make
this
the
law
of
the
case
or
raise
it,
what
you
are
going
to
do
with
when
you
drag
a
man
in
the
courtroom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
try
to,
how
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
kaufman
and
the
petitioner
didn’t
come
there
voluntarily,
didn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
objected
to
the
proceeding.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
could
they
be
bound
by
it?
did
they
ever
submit
to
a
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
file
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
get
jurisdiction
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
i'm
saying
is
i’m
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
i
got
this
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
roberts
against
lavallee?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
this
case
that
he
was
entitled
to
another
instruction,
he
would
be
retried?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
same
evidence
would
be
used?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
kind
of
fundamental
is
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
but
once
you
lose
your
motion
to
suppress,
you
don’t
have
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
that
log
like
roberts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
shepherd,
you
were
right
with
that
argument.
they
granted
certiorari
right
and
upheld
judgment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
try
to
get
too
much
out
of
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
try
to
get
too
much
out
of
that,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
was
an
opinion
and
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
your
opinion?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
you
are
entitled
to
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
known
of
a
dope

any,
the
dope
being
used?
[laughter]
i've
never
heard
there
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
more
to
the
point
as
i
understand
that
your
point
is
that
the
fourth
circuit
could
have
passed
on
both
points
but
they
didn’t
have
to
pay
a
small
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood

they
could’ve
passed
on
both.
