justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kaufman,
do
you
read
the
sharp
case
from
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
as
turning
on
state
or
federal
constitutional
consideration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
ruled
exactly
the
same
way
that
district
court
had?
it
had
upheld
your
federal
constitution
claim
on
the
instruction.
would
it
then
have
been
proper
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
say,
we
don’t
have
to
pass
on
the
fourth
amendment
claim
since
your
man
is
going
to
get
a
new
trial
anyway?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
make
both
a
miranda
claim
in
the
search
and
seizure
claim
and
your
federal
habeas
petition,
is
it
your
position
that
the
district
court
must
pass
on
the
merits
of
both
them
if
exhaustion
is
present?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
conceivably
on
a
retrial
the
state
court
might
hold
the
factual
hearing
again
on
the
search
and
seizure
thing
that
might
be
adequate
under
the
1966
revisions
to
habeas
corpus
act,
might
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
a
writ
of
error
denied
case
in
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
did
say
though.
if
you
would
have
an
opportunity
and
did
raise
the
question
before
the
state
courts
on
direct
appeal,
you
didn’t
have
to
go
back
in
a
state
collateral
proceeding
to
raise
the
same
thing
all
over
again,
did
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
apparent
for
me
that
the
district
court
opinion
or
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
that
the
states
simply
would
not
have
tried
the
man
again
had
the
search
and
seizure
point
been
resolved
against
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
with
mr.
shepherd,
mr.
kaufman
that
those
practices
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
is
not
to
pass
on
an
issue
such
as
that
if
it
wasn’t
raised
any
differently
than
you
raised
it
in
the
circuit
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
not
on
the
merits
of
a
claim
that
prior
decisions
of
the
court
would
hold
couldn’t
properly
be
raised
in
the
absence
of
a
suitable
objection?
