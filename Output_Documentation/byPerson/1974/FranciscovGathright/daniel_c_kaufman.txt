mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
two
questions
are
presented
for
the
court’s
consideration.
first
is,
may
a
federal
habeas
corpus
court
decline
to
consider
the
merits
of
an
issue
already
presented
in
a
direct
appeal
to
a
state
supreme
court
merely
because
the
state
supreme
court
in
a
later
case
has
accepted
the
same
position
that
was
earlier
urged
upon
them?
secondly,
may
a
federal
habeas
corpus
court
decline
to
reach
a
fully
exhausted
issue
merely
because
it
shares
a
habeas
corpus
petition
with
an
unexhausted
issue?
we
submit
that
both
for
these
questions
should
be
answered
in
the
negative
and
that
petitioner
should
have
a
prompt
adjudication
of
both
of
his
habeas
corpus
issues
by
a
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
no
your
honor,
not
at
all.
what
had
happened
is
in
response
to
the
district
court
opinion
which
devolved
upon
the
state
the
burden
of
going
forward.
the
commonwealth
had
petitioned
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county
to
initiate
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
on
petitioner’s
behalf
at
which
the
presumably
the
instruction
issue
would
be
raised
before
them
and
that's
how
that
was
said
in
motion.
and
other
counsel
were
appointed
by
the
fairfax
court
and
when
i
received
notice
of
those
proceedings
i
both
moot
in
the
federal
court
to
stay
them
and
also
when
the
federal
court
refuse
to
stay
those
proceedings
appeared
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
and
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
you
focused
on
one
of
the
issues
that
respondent
has
raised
that
is
why
didn’t
i
just
go
back
into
the
state
court
have
this
issue
--
this
instruction
issue
adjudicated
and
done
with.
i
would
submit
that
there
are
numerous
reasons
for
not
going
back.
first
of
which,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
although
commonwealth
through
the
attorney
general
would
be
satisfied
to
have
the
issue
adjudicated
by
the
state
court.
it’s
not
at
all
clear
under
the
state
court
rule
of
hawks
versus
cox
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
state
court
would
even
hear
the
merits
of
the
instruction
issue
because
the
instruction
issue
was
raised
on
direct
appeal
and
the
writ
of
error
denied
and
the
hawks
doctrine
states
that
absent
change
circumstances
determination
of
an
issue
by
a
state
or
federal
court
is
conclusive
and
there
is
no
indication
that
the
sharp
decision
upon
which
the
commonwealth
relies
is
a
change
circumstance
within
the
meaning
of
hawks
doctrine.
secondly,
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
he
is
still
at
bland
correctional
farm,
southwestern
virginia.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor.
for
the
reason
that
first
of
all
it’s
not
at
all
clear
that
the
state
court
would
even
consider
the
merits
of
the
instruction
issue
much
less
ruin
our
favor
on
it.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
he
indicated
that
that
we
could
return
if
the
state
did
refuse
to
consider
it,
but
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
case
and
there
was
a
search
and
seizure
issue
also
presented.
and
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
no,
i
don’t
think
so
at
all.
i
think
what
happens
is
if
we
were
to
go
back
and
if
we
were
to
get
a
favorable
ruling
from
the
state
court
on
the
instruction
issue
which
is
by
no
means
clear.
we
would
still
have
this
unresolved
search
and
seizure
issue.
mr.
francisco
probably
would
be
retried.
i
seen
the
commonwealth
is
certainly
not
stipulated
they
will
not
retry
him.
absent,
that
even
without
the
challenge
instruction
i
see
no
reason
why
we
could
not
expect
that
he
would
be
again
convicted
at
least
of
the
offense
of
simple
possession
of
controlled
substance
which
the
instruction
is
not
related.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
what
we’re
asking
for
is
a
decision
on
search
and
seizure,
and
the
instruction
issue.
if
the
search
and
seizure
issue
is
resolved
in
our
favor
on
the
merits,
then
as
a
practical
matter,
the
state
cannot
retry
him
because
there
simply
is
no
evidence
that
could
be
introduced
that
was
not
illegally
seized
or
is
not
the
fruit
of
illegally
seized
evidence.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall
i
don’t
quite
understand
your
question.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
well,
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
did
they
vacated
that
part
of
the
decision
of
district
court
which
ruled
on
a
search
and
seizure
issue
and
said
that
the
federal
courts
should
stay
their
hands
entirely
on
that
issue
until
the
full
gambit
of
the
state
court
proceeding
is
on
its
course.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
yes.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
we
would
not
be
any
worse
off,
we
would
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
i
beg
to
disagree
for
the
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
i
understand
that.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
not
to
the
extent
that
he
faced
retrial
and
the
risk
of
an
increase
sentence
upon
that
retrial
since
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
unequivocally,
and
was
not
retried?
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
then
you're
plainly
correct.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
because
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
no,
i
did
not
think
that
i
could
prevail
on
the
instruction
issue
and
for
that
reason
alone
have
the
state
declined
to
prosecute
him
further.
i
simply
then
lost
the
belief
that
they
would
let
the
matter
rest
and
they
have
certainly
not
indicated
that
they
are
willing
not
to
retry
him
if
his
conviction
is
set
aside
only
on
the
instruction
issue.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
exactly.
they
--
well,
there’s
absolutely
no
question
at
all
that
the
search
and
seizure
issue
had
been
fully
exhausted,
there
have
been
no
change
in
state
law
whatever
and
the
state
courts
would
probably
decline
to
hear
it
again
even
on
a
retry.
i
think
if
you
take
the
commonwealth’s
position
that
the
chain
of
events
of
a
direct
appeal
and
a
subsequent
state
court
decision
what
you
wined
up
with
is
more
interference
with
state
court
proceedings
because
you'll
have
the
federal
courts
anytime
a
new
state
court
decision
comes
out.
the
federal
courts
will
be
called
upon
to
determine
whether
this
new
decision
is
going
to
affect
habeas
corpus
petitions
presently
pending
before
it
and
if
there's
any
question
that
it
will
or
it
won't
even
though
those
issues
were
presented
to
the
state
court
in
direct
proceedings,
the
federal
court
would
be
constrained
or
would
be
authorized
to
send
it
back
into
the
state
courts
which
have
indicated
no
interest
in
hearing
the
question.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
both
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
it’s
clear
that
they
relied
on
their
own
line
of
cases
and
also
in
this
court’s
decision
in
leary
on
the
federal
issue
on
whether
this
is
an
irrational
hence,
an
unconstitutional
presumption.
i
think
that
this
court
has
indicated
in
roberts
v.
lavallee
which
has
been
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
mere
possibility
of
successful
pursuit
of
a
state
remedy
that
is
open
is
not
sufficient
to
send
the
petitioner
back
to
exhaust
that
remedy
again
when
he
has
exhausted
once
before.
this
court’s
been
fairly
clear
that
repetitious
applications
to
state
court
are
just
not
required
of
a
habeas
corpus
petition.
he
is
just
required
to
once
give
the
state
courts
a
fair
opportunity
to
resolve
the
issue
and
mr.
francisco
has
given
the
state
court
in
his
direct
appeal
their
opportunity
to
adjudicate
the
precise
question
which
they
later
adjudicated
in
sharp.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
your
honor,
it
was
cited
to
the
district
court
in
my
motion
to
stay
proceedings
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
43.
and
the
fourth
circuit
by
a
virtue
of
their
abbreviated
procedure
in
habeas
corpus
matters
did
not
call
for
full
briefing
on
this
case
but
merely
sent
petitioner
a
letter
asking
him
to
informally
inform
that
court
what
complaint
he
had
of
the
district
court’s
decision.
he
in
turn
forward
that
letter
to
me
and
i
responded
in
somewhat
informal
fashion
in
light
of
the
circuit
court’s
request
and
did
not
cite
any
cases
in
that
letter.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
the
federal
habeas
petition
was
formally
filed
after
the
sharp
case
was
decided.
it
was
received
by
the
district
court
accompanied
by
application
to
proceed
informal
corpus
two
days
after
sharp
but
was
and
was
the
delay
between
the
receipt
by
the
district
court
in
filing
took
place
because
of
the
district
court’s
refusal
to
grant
informal
corpus
status
at
that
stage.
however,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
petition,
you'll
see
that
it
was
verified
by
the
petitioner
in
september
which
was
prior
to
the
october
3rd
decision
in
sharp.
so,
it
wasn’t
a
case
were
the
sharp
decision
came
down
he
said,
there's
a
great
decision
let’s
run
with
it
in
the
federal
courts.
the
petition
was
fully
prepared
for
the
sharp
decision
that’s
been
handed
down.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
frankly,
your
honor
i
was
not
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
sharp
decision
until
some
two
weeks
later
when
it
finally
made
its
way
into
the
informal
legal
press
and
then
it
was
not
formally
reported
in
the
southeast
reporter
until
some
months
later.
so,
at
the
time
the
petition
was
actually
sent
to
the
district
court
both
i
and
petitioner
were
unaware
of
the
existence
of
the
sharp
decision.
i
think
also
we
have
to
look
not
only
to
the
instruction
issue
which
was
involved
in
sharp
but
we
have
to
look
the
search
and
seizure
issue
which
was
by
everyone’s
notion
fully
and
completely
exhausted
absolutely
right
for
decision.
and
what
the
fourth
circuit
did
and
the
district
court
did
not
do
was
to
say,
well,
the
district
court
is
right
in
sending
you
back
to
the
state
courts
to
have
your
instruction
issue
adjudicated.
but
what
the
district
court
should
have
also
done
is
state
its
hand
on
a
completely
independent
search
and
seizure
issue
and
not
even
reached
the
merits
of
that
issue.
and
accordingly,
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
that
portion
of
a
district
court
opinion
which
did
deal
with
the
search
and
seizure
issue
and
i
would
submit
that
that's
wholly
inappropriate
way
of
treating
a
multiple
issue
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
no,
i
don’t
think
that
that’s
the
proper
course
to
take
for
the
basic
reason
that
the
search
and
seizure
issue
is
as
a
matter
of
practicality
dispositive
of
a
retrial.
there's
very
little
point
in
saying
if
we’re
going
to
make
a
choice
on
issues
and
say
because
we
reached
one
issue,
we’re
not
going
to
reach
another.
reaching
the
instruction
issue
and
not
reaching
the
search
and
seizure
issue
seems
to
be
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse
because
if
you
say,
let's
leave
the
search
and
seizure
issue
ride
for
awhile,
let's
allow
him
to
be
retried,
allow
him
to
have
another
state
appeal
wherein
that
instruction
presumably
will
not
be
given.
and
then
some
two
or
three
years
later
will
be
in
a
position
to
rule
on
a
search
and
seizure
issue
which
would
have
been
dispositive
in
the
first
instance
and
would’ve
not
required
any
further
proceedings
in
the
state
court
of
any
character.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
well,
i
would
first
say
that
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
judicial
economy
and
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
habeas
corpus
writ
that
a
court
should
always
pass
on
all
issues
presented
to
it
and
right
for
adjudication
because
they
will
in
many
instances
control
a
retrial.
but
i
think
in
an
individual
case,
you
also
have
to
examine
--
make
an
examination
of
what
else
is
there
beside
this
particular
issue
that
could
come
up
in
a
retrial.
now,
if
you
had
a
miranda
issue
and
a
search
and
seizure
issue
for
example
and
if
excluding
the
confession
would
not
as
a
practical
matter
--
preclude
a
retrial.
then,
i
think
you
want
to
reach
--
and
the
search
and
seizure
would
then
i
think
you
want
to
reach
that
issue
which
would
as
a
practical
matter
preclude
a
retrial
because
otherwise
you'll
wind
up
with
a
retrial
that
may
proof
fruitless.
you'll
also
--
what
you
also
be
doing
is
interfering
with
the
fact-finding
process
that
will
ultimately
have
to
be
made
on
a
search
and
seizure
issue
or
miranda
issue
or
any
kind
of
an
issue
where
we
have
to
go
outside
of
the
record
or
we
could
go
outside
of
the
record
to
determine
the
issue.
what
you're
doing
by
permitting
a
retrial
with
an
issue
unresolved
is
at
best
you're
delaying
it
and
you
may
impair
the
fact-finding
process
when
a
federal
district
court
is
ultimately
called
upon
to
decide
it.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
it
might
well
be
but
it
might
also
be
that
the
state
court
would
say
that
the
prior
decision
on
a
prior
motion
to
suppress
is
the
law
of
the
case.
we
were
simply
in
a
very
murky
procedural
area
and
what
we’re
doing
is
it
seems
to
me
going
to
and
snare
a
petitioner
this
on
procedural
murkiness
areas
and
sort
of
in
the
hope
that
the
case
will
go
away
which
is
the
fourth
circuit
seem
to
say
what
might
be
that
this
case
is
going
to
be
moot
one
day
and
will
never
have
to
rule
on
this
search
and
seizure
issue.
and
i
simply
don’t
believe
that
a
federal
court
should
speculate
as
to
mootness
on
this
kind
of
a
record
where
there's
simply
no
reason
to
believe
that
francisco
would
not
be
retried.
there's
simply
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
could
not
be
again
convicted
by
the
state
at
least
of
the
lesser
included
offense
of
simple
possession.
and
it’s
plain
that
the
search
and
seizure
issue
relates
altogether
with
whether
they
can
convict
him
possessing
a
controlled
substance
at
all.
instruction
issue
merely
goes
to
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
state
court
under
proper
instructions
for
the
jury
who
was
found
guilty
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute.
i
think
this
interference
with
the
fact-finding
process
is
the
same
kind
of
concern
this
court
expressed
in
barker
versus
wingo,
the
speedy
trial
case
as
the
reasons
for
not
delaying
the
trial
--
the
initial
trial
on
the
merits.
and
i
think
the
other
aspect
of
prejudice
alluded
to
by
this
court
in
barker
is
that
of
anxiety
is
still
present
in
this
case.
petitioner
still
has
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
ultimate
outcome
of
his
fourth
amendment
issue
is
going
to
be
if
this
court
says
that
the
courts
below
were
right
and
that
we
should
go
back
into
state
court
thrash
out
the
instruction
issue.
if
we
win
have
a
new
trial
maybe
have
him
convicted
to
a
more
severe
sentence
to
a
more
time
by
the
jury.
and
then
he
can
have
his
fourth
amendment
issue
finally
resolved
by
the
federal
courts.
i
think
if
we
also
adopt
the
commonwealth’s
position
in
that
regard
where
you
have
a
multiple
issue
situation
and
assuming
arguendo
that
this
court
decides
the
instruction
issue
has
not
been
appropriately
exhausted
and
that
the
instruction
issue
is
really
properly
before
this
--
the
state
court.
i
think
what
you
wind
up
with
doing
is
encouraging
petitions
for
certiorari
to
this
court
because
people
who
were
convicted
in
state
court
who
have,
let's
say
a
federal
constitutional
claim
which
they
have
directly
raised
and
have
fully
adjudicated
in
direct
appeal.
yet,
they
have
other
constitutional
claims
which
have
not
been
so
adjudicated
would
be
discouraged
from
seeking
intervention
of
the
lower
federal
courts
by
habeas
corpus
petition
but
it
would
instead
be
encourage
to
petition
this
court
for
review
by
certiorari
on
that
very
issue
that
was
in
fact
decided
by
the
state
supreme
court.
and
i
think
as
this
court
recognized
in
fay
assert
petition
on
a
direct
appeal
is
an
unnecessarily
burdensome
step
in
vindication
of
federal
constitutional
rights
where
it
can
be
relied
upon
that
the
federal
--
the
lower
federal
courts
will
be
in
a
position
to
hold
hearings
if
need
be
or
would
be
in
a
position
to
adjudicate
these
federal
constitutional
issues.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
yes
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
on
the
objection
in
state
court
i
would
freely
conceive
that
inexperience
trial
counsel
namely
me
in
the
heat
of
a
hotly
contested
trial
just
overlooked
that
grounds
for
objecting
to
that
instruction.
but
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
constitutionality
of
that
instruction
was
plainly
unmistakably
raised
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
error
as
demonstrated
on
the
pages
31
and
32
of
the
appendix.
the
commonwealth
in
responding
to
that
petition
the
abstract
there
is
page
34
of
the
appendix
addressed
the
merits
so
that
there
was
no
question
at
that
time
of
any
procedural
default
in
raising
the
constitutionality
of
that
instruction.
and
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
level
has
the
commonwealth
asserted
procedural
default
in
raising
that
issue.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
the
practice
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
to
be
aware
of
the
rational
for
their
decision
but
as
mr.
shepherd
pointed
out
it
was
a
decision
and
it
has
the
effect
of
the
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
i
would
tend
to
agree
that
that
would
certainly
be
an
open
question
had
the
commonwealth
in
opposing
the
petition
called
the
court’s
attention
to
some
defect
in
the
objection
but
they
did
not.
they
went
right
to
the
merits
of
the
instruction
itself,
there
was
no
question
raised
at
that
point
as
to
any
procedural
default.
and
in
that
regard,
i
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
a
recent
the
reported
decision
of
an
en
banc
panel
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
harris
versus
superior
court
which
appears
of
500
f.2d
1124
where
the
court
there
said
a
state
court
decision
which
could
have
been
procedurally
founded
will
not
be
presumed
to
be
procedurally
founded
in
a
habeas
corpus
case
unless
the
state
court
in
its
decision
expressly
states
that
it’s
declining
to
reach
the
issue
of
the
claim
on
a
per
procedural
matter.
also
on,
mr.
shepherd
would
have
send
this
back
to
the
state
courts
because
there's
something
different
about
the
way
the
state
court
and
the
state
habeas
corpus
proceeding
would
handle
it
than
the
federal
court
would
mention
this
concept
of
harmless
error
and
i
would
suggest
the
court
that
harmless
errors
always
present
in
any
habeas
corpus
petition
whether
it
be
state
or
federal
and
it’s
present
in
the
direct
appeals.
i
don’t
see
any
difference
between
the
kinds
of
question
and
the
ability
of
a
court
to
consider
the
kinds
of
questions
whether
it’s
a
state
court
or
federal
court.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
bench,
i
would
submit.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
two
questions
are
presented
for
the
court’s
consideration.
first
is,
may
a
federal
habeas
corpus
court
decline
to
consider
the
merits
of
an
issue
already
presented
in
a
direct
appeal
to
a
state
supreme
court
merely
because
the
state
supreme
court
in
a
later
case
has
accepted
the
same
position
that
was
earlier
urged
upon
them?
secondly,
may
a
federal
habeas
corpus
court
decline
to
reach
a
fully
exhausted
issue
merely
because
it
shares
a
habeas
corpus
petition
with
an
unexhausted
issue?
we
submit
that
both
for
these
questions
should
be
answered
in
the
negative
and
that
petitioner
should
have
a
prompt
adjudication
of
both
of
his
habeas
corpus
issues
by
a
federal
court.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
no
your
honor,
not
at
all.
what
had
happened
is
in
response
to
the
district
court
opinion
which
devolved
upon
the
state
the
burden
of
going
forward.
the
commonwealth
had
petitioned
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county
to
initiate
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
on
petitioner’s
behalf
at
which
the
presumably
the
instruction
issue
would
be
raised
before
them
and
that's
how
that
was
said
in
motion.
and
other
counsel
were
appointed
by
the
fairfax
court
and
when
i
received
notice
of
those
proceedings
i
both
moot
in
the
federal
court
to
stay
them
and
also
when
the
federal
court
refuse
to
stay
those
proceedings
appeared
in
the
state
court
proceeding.
and
i
think
mr.
chief
justice,
you
focused
on
one
of
the
issues
that
respondent
has
raised
that
is
why
didn’t
i
just
go
back
into
the
state
court
have
this
issue
--
this
instruction
issue
adjudicated
and
done
with.
i
would
submit
that
there
are
numerous
reasons
for
not
going
back.
first
of
which,
it
is
not
at
all
clear
that
although
commonwealth
through
the
attorney
general
would
be
satisfied
to
have
the
issue
adjudicated
by
the
state
court.
it’s
not
at
all
clear
under
the
state
court
rule
of
hawks
versus
cox
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
state
court
would
even
hear
the
merits
of
the
instruction
issue
because
the
instruction
issue
was
raised
on
direct
appeal
and
the
writ
of
error
denied
and
the
hawks
doctrine
states
that
absent
change
circumstances
determination
of
an
issue
by
a
state
or
federal
court
is
conclusive
and
there
is
no
indication
that
the
sharp
decision
upon
which
the
commonwealth
relies
is
a
change
circumstance
within
the
meaning
of
hawks
doctrine.
secondly,
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
he
is
still
at
bland
correctional
farm,
southwestern
virginia.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
i
don’t
believe
so,
your
honor.
for
the
reason
that
first
of
all
it’s
not
at
all
clear
that
the
state
court
would
even
consider
the
merits
of
the
instruction
issue
much
less
ruin
our
favor
on
it.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
he
indicated
that
that
we
could
return
if
the
state
did
refuse
to
consider
it,
but
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
case
and
there
was
a
search
and
seizure
issue
also
presented.
and
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
no,
i
don’t
think
so
at
all.
i
think
what
happens
is
if
we
were
to
go
back
and
if
we
were
to
get
a
favorable
ruling
from
the
state
court
on
the
instruction
issue
which
is
by
no
means
clear.
we
would
still
have
this
unresolved
search
and
seizure
issue.
mr.
francisco
probably
would
be
retried.
i
seen
the
commonwealth
is
certainly
not
stipulated
they
will
not
retry
him.
absent,
that
even
without
the
challenge
instruction
i
see
no
reason
why
we
could
not
expect
that
he
would
be
again
convicted
at
least
of
the
offense
of
simple
possession
of
controlled
substance
which
the
instruction
is
not
related.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
your
honor,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
what
we’re
asking
for
is
a
decision
on
search
and
seizure,
and
the
instruction
issue.
if
the
search
and
seizure
issue
is
resolved
in
our
favor
on
the
merits,
then
as
a
practical
matter,
the
state
cannot
retry
him
because
there
simply
is
no
evidence
that
could
be
introduced
that
was
not
illegally
seized
or
is
not
the
fruit
of
illegally
seized
evidence.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
marshall
i
don’t
quite
understand
your
question.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
well,
as
the
court
of
appeals
below
did
they
vacated
that
part
of
the
decision
of
district
court
which
ruled
on
a
search
and
seizure
issue
and
said
that
the
federal
courts
should
stay
their
hands
entirely
on
that
issue
until
the
full
gambit
of
the
state
court
proceeding
is
on
its
course.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
yes.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
we
would
not
be
any
worse
off,
we
would
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
i
beg
to
disagree
for
the
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
i
understand
that.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
not
to
the
extent
that
he
faced
retrial
and
the
risk
of
an
increase
sentence
upon
that
retrial
since
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
unequivocally,
and
was
not
retried?
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
then
you're
plainly
correct.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
because
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
no,
i
did
not
think
that
i
could
prevail
on
the
instruction
issue
and
for
that
reason
alone
have
the
state
declined
to
prosecute
him
further.
i
simply
then
lost
the
belief
that
they
would
let
the
matter
rest
and
they
have
certainly
not
indicated
that
they
are
willing
not
to
retry
him
if
his
conviction
is
set
aside
only
on
the
instruction
issue.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
exactly.
they
--
well,
there’s
absolutely
no
question
at
all
that
the
search
and
seizure
issue
had
been
fully
exhausted,
there
have
been
no
change
in
state
law
whatever
and
the
state
courts
would
probably
decline
to
hear
it
again
even
on
a
retry.
i
think
if
you
take
the
commonwealth’s
position
that
the
chain
of
events
of
a
direct
appeal
and
a
subsequent
state
court
decision
what
you
wined
up
with
is
more
interference
with
state
court
proceedings
because
you'll
have
the
federal
courts
anytime
a
new
state
court
decision
comes
out.
the
federal
courts
will
be
called
upon
to
determine
whether
this
new
decision
is
going
to
affect
habeas
corpus
petitions
presently
pending
before
it
and
if
there's
any
question
that
it
will
or
it
won't
even
though
those
issues
were
presented
to
the
state
court
in
direct
proceedings,
the
federal
court
would
be
constrained
or
would
be
authorized
to
send
it
back
into
the
state
courts
which
have
indicated
no
interest
in
hearing
the
question.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
both
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
it’s
clear
that
they
relied
on
their
own
line
of
cases
and
also
in
this
court’s
decision
in
leary
on
the
federal
issue
on
whether
this
is
an
irrational
hence,
an
unconstitutional
presumption.
i
think
that
this
court
has
indicated
in
roberts
v.
lavallee
which
has
been
cited
in
our
brief
that
the
mere
possibility
of
successful
pursuit
of
a
state
remedy
that
is
open
is
not
sufficient
to
send
the
petitioner
back
to
exhaust
that
remedy
again
when
he
has
exhausted
once
before.
this
court’s
been
fairly
clear
that
repetitious
applications
to
state
court
are
just
not
required
of
a
habeas
corpus
petition.
he
is
just
required
to
once
give
the
state
courts
a
fair
opportunity
to
resolve
the
issue
and
mr.
francisco
has
given
the
state
court
in
his
direct
appeal
their
opportunity
to
adjudicate
the
precise
question
which
they
later
adjudicated
in
sharp.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
your
honor,
it
was
cited
to
the
district
court
in
my
motion
to
stay
proceedings
which
appears
in
the
appendix
at
43.
and
the
fourth
circuit
by
a
virtue
of
their
abbreviated
procedure
in
habeas
corpus
matters
did
not
call
for
full
briefing
on
this
case
but
merely
sent
petitioner
a
letter
asking
him
to
informally
inform
that
court
what
complaint
he
had
of
the
district
court’s
decision.
he
in
turn
forward
that
letter
to
me
and
i
responded
in
somewhat
informal
fashion
in
light
of
the
circuit
court’s
request
and
did
not
cite
any
cases
in
that
letter.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
the
federal
habeas
petition
was
formally
filed
after
the
sharp
case
was
decided.
it
was
received
by
the
district
court
accompanied
by
application
to
proceed
informal
corpus
two
days
after
sharp
but
was
and
was
the
delay
between
the
receipt
by
the
district
court
in
filing
took
place
because
of
the
district
court’s
refusal
to
grant
informal
corpus
status
at
that
stage.
however,
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
petition,
you'll
see
that
it
was
verified
by
the
petitioner
in
september
which
was
prior
to
the
october
3rd
decision
in
sharp.
so,
it
wasn’t
a
case
were
the
sharp
decision
came
down
he
said,
there's
a
great
decision
let’s
run
with
it
in
the
federal
courts.
the
petition
was
fully
prepared
for
the
sharp
decision
that’s
been
handed
down.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
frankly,
your
honor
i
was
not
aware
of
the
existence
of
the
sharp
decision
until
some
two
weeks
later
when
it
finally
made
its
way
into
the
informal
legal
press
and
then
it
was
not
formally
reported
in
the
southeast
reporter
until
some
months
later.
so,
at
the
time
the
petition
was
actually
sent
to
the
district
court
both
i
and
petitioner
were
unaware
of
the
existence
of
the
sharp
decision.
i
think
also
we
have
to
look
not
only
to
the
instruction
issue
which
was
involved
in
sharp
but
we
have
to
look
the
search
and
seizure
issue
which
was
by
everyone’s
notion
fully
and
completely
exhausted
absolutely
right
for
decision.
and
what
the
fourth
circuit
did
and
the
district
court
did
not
do
was
to
say,
well,
the
district
court
is
right
in
sending
you
back
to
the
state
courts
to
have
your
instruction
issue
adjudicated.
but
what
the
district
court
should
have
also
done
is
state
its
hand
on
a
completely
independent
search
and
seizure
issue
and
not
even
reached
the
merits
of
that
issue.
and
accordingly,
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
that
portion
of
a
district
court
opinion
which
did
deal
with
the
search
and
seizure
issue
and
i
would
submit
that
that's
wholly
inappropriate
way
of
treating
a
multiple
issue
habeas
corpus
petition.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
no,
i
don’t
think
that
that’s
the
proper
course
to
take
for
the
basic
reason
that
the
search
and
seizure
issue
is
as
a
matter
of
practicality
dispositive
of
a
retrial.
there's
very
little
point
in
saying
if
we’re
going
to
make
a
choice
on
issues
and
say
because
we
reached
one
issue,
we’re
not
going
to
reach
another.
reaching
the
instruction
issue
and
not
reaching
the
search
and
seizure
issue
seems
to
be
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse
because
if
you
say,
let's
leave
the
search
and
seizure
issue
ride
for
awhile,
let's
allow
him
to
be
retried,
allow
him
to
have
another
state
appeal
wherein
that
instruction
presumably
will
not
be
given.
and
then
some
two
or
three
years
later
will
be
in
a
position
to
rule
on
a
search
and
seizure
issue
which
would
have
been
dispositive
in
the
first
instance
and
would’ve
not
required
any
further
proceedings
in
the
state
court
of
any
character.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
well,
i
would
first
say
that
i
believe
as
a
matter
of
judicial
economy
and
the
fundamental
nature
of
the
habeas
corpus
writ
that
a
court
should
always
pass
on
all
issues
presented
to
it
and
right
for
adjudication
because
they
will
in
many
instances
control
a
retrial.
but
i
think
in
an
individual
case,
you
also
have
to
examine
--
make
an
examination
of
what
else
is
there
beside
this
particular
issue
that
could
come
up
in
a
retrial.
now,
if
you
had
a
miranda
issue
and
a
search
and
seizure
issue
for
example
and
if
excluding
the
confession
would
not
as
a
practical
matter
--
preclude
a
retrial.
then,
i
think
you
want
to
reach
--
and
the
search
and
seizure
would
then
i
think
you
want
to
reach
that
issue
which
would
as
a
practical
matter
preclude
a
retrial
because
otherwise
you'll
wind
up
with
a
retrial
that
may
proof
fruitless.
you'll
also
--
what
you
also
be
doing
is
interfering
with
the
fact-finding
process
that
will
ultimately
have
to
be
made
on
a
search
and
seizure
issue
or
miranda
issue
or
any
kind
of
an
issue
where
we
have
to
go
outside
of
the
record
or
we
could
go
outside
of
the
record
to
determine
the
issue.
what
you're
doing
by
permitting
a
retrial
with
an
issue
unresolved
is
at
best
you're
delaying
it
and
you
may
impair
the
fact-finding
process
when
a
federal
district
court
is
ultimately
called
upon
to
decide
it.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
it
might
well
be
but
it
might
also
be
that
the
state
court
would
say
that
the
prior
decision
on
a
prior
motion
to
suppress
is
the
law
of
the
case.
we
were
simply
in
a
very
murky
procedural
area
and
what
we’re
doing
is
it
seems
to
me
going
to
and
snare
a
petitioner
this
on
procedural
murkiness
areas
and
sort
of
in
the
hope
that
the
case
will
go
away
which
is
the
fourth
circuit
seem
to
say
what
might
be
that
this
case
is
going
to
be
moot
one
day
and
will
never
have
to
rule
on
this
search
and
seizure
issue.
and
i
simply
don’t
believe
that
a
federal
court
should
speculate
as
to
mootness
on
this
kind
of
a
record
where
there's
simply
no
reason
to
believe
that
francisco
would
not
be
retried.
there's
simply
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
could
not
be
again
convicted
by
the
state
at
least
of
the
lesser
included
offense
of
simple
possession.
and
it’s
plain
that
the
search
and
seizure
issue
relates
altogether
with
whether
they
can
convict
him
possessing
a
controlled
substance
at
all.
instruction
issue
merely
goes
to
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
in
state
court
under
proper
instructions
for
the
jury
who
was
found
guilty
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute.
i
think
this
interference
with
the
fact-finding
process
is
the
same
kind
of
concern
this
court
expressed
in
barker
versus
wingo,
the
speedy
trial
case
as
the
reasons
for
not
delaying
the
trial
--
the
initial
trial
on
the
merits.
and
i
think
the
other
aspect
of
prejudice
alluded
to
by
this
court
in
barker
is
that
of
anxiety
is
still
present
in
this
case.
petitioner
still
has
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
ultimate
outcome
of
his
fourth
amendment
issue
is
going
to
be
if
this
court
says
that
the
courts
below
were
right
and
that
we
should
go
back
into
state
court
thrash
out
the
instruction
issue.
if
we
win
have
a
new
trial
maybe
have
him
convicted
to
a
more
severe
sentence
to
a
more
time
by
the
jury.
and
then
he
can
have
his
fourth
amendment
issue
finally
resolved
by
the
federal
courts.
i
think
if
we
also
adopt
the
commonwealth’s
position
in
that
regard
where
you
have
a
multiple
issue
situation
and
assuming
arguendo
that
this
court
decides
the
instruction
issue
has
not
been
appropriately
exhausted
and
that
the
instruction
issue
is
really
properly
before
this
--
the
state
court.
i
think
what
you
wind
up
with
doing
is
encouraging
petitions
for
certiorari
to
this
court
because
people
who
were
convicted
in
state
court
who
have,
let's
say
a
federal
constitutional
claim
which
they
have
directly
raised
and
have
fully
adjudicated
in
direct
appeal.
yet,
they
have
other
constitutional
claims
which
have
not
been
so
adjudicated
would
be
discouraged
from
seeking
intervention
of
the
lower
federal
courts
by
habeas
corpus
petition
but
it
would
instead
be
encourage
to
petition
this
court
for
review
by
certiorari
on
that
very
issue
that
was
in
fact
decided
by
the
state
supreme
court.
and
i
think
as
this
court
recognized
in
fay
assert
petition
on
a
direct
appeal
is
an
unnecessarily
burdensome
step
in
vindication
of
federal
constitutional
rights
where
it
can
be
relied
upon
that
the
federal
--
the
lower
federal
courts
will
be
in
a
position
to
hold
hearings
if
need
be
or
would
be
in
a
position
to
adjudicate
these
federal
constitutional
issues.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
yes
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
on
the
objection
in
state
court
i
would
freely
conceive
that
inexperience
trial
counsel
namely
me
in
the
heat
of
a
hotly
contested
trial
just
overlooked
that
grounds
for
objecting
to
that
instruction.
but
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
constitutionality
of
that
instruction
was
plainly
unmistakably
raised
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
error
as
demonstrated
on
the
pages
31
and
32
of
the
appendix.
the
commonwealth
in
responding
to
that
petition
the
abstract
there
is
page
34
of
the
appendix
addressed
the
merits
so
that
there
was
no
question
at
that
time
of
any
procedural
default
in
raising
the
constitutionality
of
that
instruction.
and
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
level
has
the
commonwealth
asserted
procedural
default
in
raising
that
issue.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
not
that
familiar
with
the
practice
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
to
be
aware
of
the
rational
for
their
decision
but
as
mr.
shepherd
pointed
out
it
was
a
decision
and
it
has
the
effect
of
the
decision
on
the
merits.
mr.
daniel
c.
kaufman
i
would
tend
to
agree
that
that
would
certainly
be
an
open
question
had
the
commonwealth
in
opposing
the
petition
called
the
court’s
attention
to
some
defect
in
the
objection
but
they
did
not.
they
went
right
to
the
merits
of
the
instruction
itself,
there
was
no
question
raised
at
that
point
as
to
any
procedural
default.
and
in
that
regard,
i
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
a
recent
the
reported
decision
of
an
en
banc
panel
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
harris
versus
superior
court
which
appears
of
500
f.2d
1124
where
the
court
there
said
a
state
court
decision
which
could
have
been
procedurally
founded
will
not
be
presumed
to
be
procedurally
founded
in
a
habeas
corpus
case
unless
the
state
court
in
its
decision
expressly
states
that
it’s
declining
to
reach
the
issue
of
the
claim
on
a
per
procedural
matter.
also
on,
mr.
shepherd
would
have
send
this
back
to
the
state
courts
because
there's
something
different
about
the
way
the
state
court
and
the
state
habeas
corpus
proceeding
would
handle
it
than
the
federal
court
would
mention
this
concept
of
harmless
error
and
i
would
suggest
the
court
that
harmless
errors
always
present
in
any
habeas
corpus
petition
whether
it
be
state
or
federal
and
it’s
present
in
the
direct
appeals.
i
don’t
see
any
difference
between
the
kinds
of
question
and
the
ability
of
a
court
to
consider
the
kinds
of
questions
whether
it’s
a
state
court
or
federal
court.
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
bench,
i
would
submit.
