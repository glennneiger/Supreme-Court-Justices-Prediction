mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
pursue
the
inquiry
that
it
seemed
to
me
that
mr.
justice
white
open
with
his
question,
and
that
inquiry
is,
what
are
specific
statutory
materials
that
are
relevant
here?
it's
our
view
that,
in
accord
with
normal
practice,
we
should
start
with
the
language
of
the
act.
the
language
set
out,
among
other
places,
in
page
2
of
our
brief
and
what
the
language
does
is
make
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
“to
refuse
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
representative
designated
or
selected
by
the
majority
of
the
employees
in
an
appropriate
unit.”
the
only
open-ended
words
there
are
“designated”
and
“or
selected,”
and
it's
perfectly
plain
that
those
words
are
not
the
equivalent
of
“certified.”
and
yet,
the
board
in
our
view,
has,
in
effect,
changed
those
words
even
though
congress
refused
to
do
so
in
1947
to
make
them
read
“certified.”
we
think
that
this
language
says,
and
says
quite
clearly
on
its
face,
that
if
the
union
secures
the
status
of
majority
representative
which
it
secures
by
being
designated
or
selected.
the
employer
has
an
obligation
at
that
point,
a
duty,
to
recognize.
the
board
says
“no,
he
has
a
privilege,
a
privilege
to
require
the
union
to
petition
for
and
secure
a
certification.”
that
privilege
is
subject
to
certain
conditions
subsequent.
it
can
be
lost
if
the
employer
commits
unfair
labor
practices
or
it
can
be
lost
if
he
voluntarily
agrees
to
some
test
of
the
union's
majority,
but
it
is
a
privilege
nonetheless.
it
is
an
absolute
privilege
subject
to
those
conditions.
there
is
no
duty--
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i--
we
tried--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
we're
supporting
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
understanding
what
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
is
or
our
understanding
of
what
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
is.
let
me
digress
to
try
to
reach
the
point
of
what
was
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
on
page
35
of
the
nlrb's
petition,
there
are
two
petitions
here,
states
the
board's
view
of
the
law.
it
says
the
board
has
adopted
a
voluntarous
view
of
the
duty
to
bargain
which
is
that,
absent
unfair
labor
practices
or
an
agreement
to
determine
majority
status
through
means
other
than
an
election
such
as
a
poll,
the
employer
has
no
duty
to
recognize
the
union.
that's
the
board's
absolute
privilege
position.
then,
on
pages
36
through
37,
the
court
of
appeals
says
“we
reject
that
absolute
privilege
position
because
it
is
contrary
to
the
statute.”
the
paragraph
on
the
bottom
of
page
37
says
“these
statutory
provisions
plainly
contemplate
employer
duty
of
recognition
even
in
the
absence
of
election
and
give
a
safeguard
to
the
employer
who
has
doubts
about
majority
status
by
assuring
him
the
right
to
file
his
own
petition
for
an
election.”
there
is
no
clear-cut
answer,
however,
either
in
the
text
of
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
to
the
question
of
when
and
in
what
circumstances
an
employer
must
take
evidence
of
majority
support
as
convincing.
so,
there
are
two
questions,
one,
is
the
board
right
in
saying
that
an
employer
never
has
a
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union,
that
he
has
an
absolute
privilege.
the
court
of
appeals
answered
that
question,
“no.”
the
next
logical
question
is
under
what
circumstances
does
the
employer
have
a
duty?
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
answer
that
question.
it
did
not
enter
a
bargaining
order
here
and,
from
pages
38
through
50
of
the
petition
appendix,
it
discussed
the
question
of
possible
rules
that
the
board
could
adopt
as
long
as
it
recognized
the
one
limitation
very
clear
on
the
statute,
that
it
couldn't
require
the
union
to
petition
for
certification
in
every
case
no
matter
what
its
showing
had
been.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
would
validate
such
a
rule
if
the
board
adopted
it,
but
it
did
not
say
that
the
board
had
to
adopt
it.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
we
would
not
accept
that.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said--
implied
that
it
would
but,
in
this
c--
let
me
say,
in
this
case,
there
were
no
employer
petitions.
no
employer
filed
a
petition,
so
that
question
of
the
effect
of
an
employer
petition
isn't
in
this
case.
it
is
an
intellectual
problem
that
has
to
be
faced,
we
think,
but
it
isn't
in
this
case.
the
order
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
simply
that
the
board
was
wrong
in
saying
that
an
employer
never
had
a
duty
and
the
order
was
to
remand,
and
then
it
remanded.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
our
view
on
why
we--
quite
frankly,
we
did
not
cross-petition
so
that
we
could
find
out
the
answer
to
the
underlying
question
before
we
got
to
what
we
regard
as
the
secondary
question,
the
secondary
question
being
under
what
circumstances
an
employer
has
a
duty.
we
thought
it
best
to
deal
with
the
board's
flat
position,
never,
at
this
point,
and
leave
it
to
the
board
to
deal
with
that
which
it
can
deal
with
because
it
is
our
view
that
this
question
which
is
here
is
when
that
the
statute
answers.
but,
it
is
our
view
that
there
are
options
opened
to
the
board
in
answering
the
secondary
question
when
hav--
when,
if
ever--
i
mean,
when
does
the
employer
have
the
duty
to
recognize
the
exact
circumstances.
in
other
words,
there
are
a
variety,
even
though
it
isn't
clearly
acknowledged
here,
there
are
a
variety
of
ways
the
union
can
prove
its
majority.
one
would
be
through
cards.
another
would
be,
as
in
this
case,
through
cards
plus
a
strike
by
the
card
signers.
another
would
be
by
giving
the
employer
cards
and
offering
to
have
him
check
it
through
a
poll
conducted
pursuant
to
safeguards.
we
may
get
different
answers
to
those.
we
think
the
board
has
an
opt--
has
a
degree
of
leeway
in
answering
the
question
of
what
is
the
specific--
what
are
the
specifics
of
when
the
employer's
duty
arises.
the
one
thing
we
do
not
think
the
board
can
do
is
to
say
that
the
employer
never
has
a
duty,
that
no
matter
what
the
union
does
in
proving
its
majority
and
no
matter
how
inactive
the
employer
is,
if
you
will,
in
reacting
to
that,
that
it
is
never
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
him
to
refuse
to
bargain.
such--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
first
of
all,
in
practical
terms,
the
union
doesn't
have
an
option.
the
whole
reason
that
there
is
a
national
labor
relations
act
is
that
employers
have
normally
not
chosen
to
deal
of
their
own
free
volition
with
unions.
so,
the
question
is,
when
does
the
employer
have
a
duty
to
deal
with
a
union?
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
we
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
don't
think
that
it
has
ever
been
the
law
that
an
employer
has
an
option,
it's--
it
has
never
been
the
law,
so
far
as
i
know
that
an
employer
has
an
option
no
matter
what
the
circumstance
is
to
cal
for
an
election.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that
is
the
essence
of
the
gissel
holding,
but
it
is
not
a
departure,
as
we
understand
it,
from
anything
that
was
the
law
starting
with
the
day
after
the
wagner
act
was
passed.
mr.
laurence
gold
not
in
terms
of
the
obligations
that
imposed
on
employers.
it's--
it
has
been
understood
since
the
first
day
of
the
wagner
act
because
of
the
plain
language
of
the
wagner
act
that
employers
have
a
duty
to
bargain
and
there
has
never
been,
as
i'm--
i
attempt
to
show--
mr.
laurence
gold
i'm
sorry.
it
has--
as
the
language
of
the
statute
shows,
they
have
a
duty
to
bargain
with
the
representative
designated
or
selected
by
the
majority.
that's
been
the
law
and,
from
1935
until
1947,
it
must
have
come
forth,
rightly
stated,
it
was
perfectly
well
settled
that
the
employer
had
an
obligation
to
bargain
with
the
union
when
the
union
presented
convincing
evidence
of
majority
support
that
he
could
not
insist
that
the
union
petition
for
an
election
and,
indeed,
it
was
perfectly
well-settled
prior
1935
that
he
had
no
right.
the
employer
had
no
right
under
any
circumstances
to
petition
for
an
election
when
there
was
only
one
union
in
the
picture.
that
was
the
law.
now,
to
get
back
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
language
of
the
statute
imposes
a
duty
on
the
employer
to
bargain
with
a
union
which
has
the
status
of
having
been
designated
or
selected
by
the
majority.
congress
did
not,
in
1935,
use
the
word
that
the
employer
only
had
a
duty
to
bargain
with
a
union
which
had
been
certified.
now,
let
me
talk
about
the
precedence
from
1935
to
1947.
early
on
in
the
act,
judge
leonard
hand,
in
the
remington
rand
case
which
is
cited
on
pages
9
and
10
of
our
brief,
said
that
the
employer
was
not
completely
at
the
mercy
of
the
union.
the
union
could
not
come
in
and
say
“we
represent
a
majority.”
the
employer
would
say
“show
me
some
evidence
of
that.”
the
union
would
say
“we
don't
choose
to
show
you
any
evidence.
in
fact,
we
represent
a
majority.
we
don't
choose
to
show
you
any
evidence.
we're
going
to
file
an
8
(a)
(5)
charge
against
you
and
prove
it
at
the
hearing.”
judge
hand
said
that
it's
permissible
to
look
at
the
statute
as
requiring
the
union
to
come
up
with
some
evidence
and,
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
does
not,
the
employer
could
say
that
he
has
a
good
faith
doubt
since
the
union
hasn't
shown
him
anything
to
back
up
its
claim
and,
on
the
other
hand,
judge
hand
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
employer--
that
because
of
this
option
for
the
employer,
it
does
not
mean
that
the
employer,
no
matter
what
the
facts
are,
can
say
he
only
thing
we
will
accept
is
a
certification.
he
says
“it
does
not
follow
from
that
immunity,
the
immunity
based
on
good
faith,
it
does
not
follow
from
that
immunity
that
the
employer
need
be
satisfied
with
no
evidence
except
the
board's
certificate.”
later
on
in
dahlstrom
metallic
door
which
is
cited
in
pages
6
and
7
of
our
brief,
a
case
in
which
there
were
no
employer
unfair
labor
practices,
judge
charles
clark,
also
second
circuit,
said
the
contention
that
bargaining
was
not
mandatory
until
the
board
had
accredited
local
307
as
bargaining
agent
is
frivolous.
an
employer
is
under
a
duty
to
bargain
as
soon
as
the
union
representative
presents
convincing
evidence
of
majority
support.
we've
cited
other
board
cases
as
well.
we--
i
don't
how
law
could
be
more
clearly
settled
that
an
employer
does
not
have--
that,
prior
to
1935,
an
employer
did
not
have--
prior
to
1947,
an
employer
did
not
have
the
option
to
say
to
a
union,
“no
matter
what
evidence
you
show
me,
the
only
thing
that
will
satisfy
me
is
a
certificate,”
or
in
practical
terms
say
the
same
thing
by
saying
“i
will
not
bargain
with
you.
you
can
go
to
the
labor
board.
you
can
do
whatever
you
want.
i
am
not
going
to
bargain
with
you.”
i
think
that
that
was
a
thoroughly
discredited
view.
i
know
of
not
a
single
case,
prior
to
1947,
which
can
be
cited
to
support
the
proposition
that
an
employer
had
such
an
option.
and,
yet,
that
is
what
the
board
would
give
to
an
employer
today.
then,
in
1947,
the
taft-hartley
amendments
were
passed
and
congress
specifically
addressed
itself
to
the
question
of
whether
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
9
(a)
should
remain
as
they
were.
the
house
which,
by
in
large,
took
the
position
which
was
less
favorable
to
unions
and
more
favorable
to
employers.
then,
the
senate
passed
a
bill
which
said
that
an
employer
who
had
failed
to
bargain
with
a
union
currently
recognized
by
the
employer
or
certified
as
such
through
an
election
under
section
9
was
the
only
one
who
was
guilty
of
a
section
8
(a)
(5).
the
practical
effect
of
that
would've
been
to
repeal
the
law
as
it
had
been
understood.
the
senate
would
not
accept
that
provision.
the
senate
insisted
that
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
9
(a)
stay
as
they
were.
the
only
change
was
that
section
8,
what
had
previously
been
section
8
(5),
became
section
8
(a)
(5)
because
of
the
addition
of
the
8
(b)
sections
creating
union
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
proposed
amendment
is
reproduced
on
page
15
of
our
brief,
the
rust-colored
brief,
and
the
house
proposed
to
amend
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
9
(a)
which,
as
i've
indicated,
together
impose
a
duty
to
represent
the--
i
mean,
to
recognize
the
representative
designated
or
selected
with
an
obligation
imposed
on
employers
to
fail
to
bargain
with
a
union
currently
recognized
by
that
employer
or
certified
as
such
through
an
election
under
section
9.
so,
the
employer
would've
been
free
of
the
duty
as
it
had
been
understood.
his
only
duty
would
be
to
recognize
a
union
that
had
been
certified
or
one
that
it
had
already
recognized.
in
the
conference
agreement--
i
mean,
in
the
house
conference
report,
and
this
is
a
house
conference
report
i'm
talking
about
now
which,
again,
is
reproduced
on
page
15
and
i
emphasize
the
word
“house
conference
report”
because
the
printed
document
which
came
out
of
conferences
at
that
time
was
prepared
by
the
house
managers
and
signed
only
by
them.
therefore,
simply
because
of
human
nature
and
nothing
else,
it
has
to
be
taken
with
somewhat
of
a
grain
of
salt
where
the
house
receded
and
there
is
an
indication
in
the
house
conference
report
that
they
really
hadn't
given
up
as
much
as
would
appear.
on
the
other
hand,
it
seems
to
us
to
be
terribly
persuasive
when
the
house
says
that
we
have
gone
along
absolutely
with
the
senate
view.
and,
this
is
what
the
con--
the
house
conference
report
says.
the
conference
agreement
follows
the
provisions
of
existing
law
in
the
case
of
section
8
(5)
which
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
bargain
collectively
with
the
representative
of
his
employees
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
9
(a).
now,
if
that
isn't
a
congressional
ratification
of
at
least
the
broad
outlines
of
the
laws
that
stood
before
and,
as
i
said,
the
law
as
it
stood
before
was
whether
or
not
employer
committed
unfair
labor
practices.
if
the
union
presented
him
with
convincing
evidence,
he
had
an
obligation,
some
obligation.
the
term
“what
was
convincing
evidence”
wasn't
flushed
out.
that's
why
we
say
that
that
question
is
open
to
the
board
on
remand,
but
the
essence,
the
objective
essence,
of
the
good
faith
standard
seems
to
us
to
have
been
quite
clearly
ratified
by
congress.
i
would
just
like
to
add
one
citation
to
what
was--
mr.
laurence

no,
our
view,
mr.
justice
white,
is
that,
once
again,
the
statute
addresses
itself
directly
to
that
question.
the
senate
had
inserted
a
provision,
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b),
giving
employers
an
option
to
file
petitions.
and,
in
the
senate
report,
it
explained
what
it
was
intent
upon
and
we've
reproduced
the
relevant
portion
of
that
explanation
on
page
17,
and
it
said
“the
present
board
rules
which,”
and
i
interject
here,
“which
allowed
employer
to
petition
for
an
election
only
where
two
union,
who
were
seeking
representative
status,
discriminate
against
employers
who
have
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
labor
organizations
claiming
to
represent
the
employees
are
really
not
the
choice
for
the
majority.
and,
what
our
view
of
what
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
was
intended
to
do
was
to
deal
with
a
situation
that
the
pre-1947
law
didn't
really
deal
with,
and
that
situation
is
the
following.
the
union
appears
on
the
scene
and
says
“we
represent
a
majority
of
your
employees.”
the
employer
says
“give
us
some
proof,”
and
again
the
union
says
“we
will
not
give
you
some
proof,
but
we're
going
to
engage
in
outsider
picketing
or
minority
picket,”
which
was
lawful.
the
employer
said
“well,
i
will
recognize
if
you
could
prove
up
your
majority.”
at--
in
that
type
of
a
situation,
the
employer
could
not
get
to
the
board
and
we
think
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
says
if
he
has
a
reasonable
doubt,
if
the
union
hasn't
fulfilled
its
obligation
of
coming
forward
with
convincing
evidence,
if
the
employer
has
fulfilled
his
affirmative
obligations
as
the
law
was
prior
to
1947
to
investigate
the
situation
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
union
had
convincing,
then
the
employer
could
file
his
petition.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
don't
see
how
the
board
could've
taken
another
view,
but
i
do
think
that
if
the
board
had
taken
another
view
between
1935
and
1947
and
if
we
had
the
same
sequence
of
events
and
a
1947
determination
by
the
conference
committee
to
follow
the
law
as
it
stood,
that
that
might
stand
up
now.
at
least
you'd
have
a
conflict
in
that
situation
between
the
plain
language
of
the
act
and
the
legislative
history
in
1947.
what
i'm
arguing
for
here
is
a
rule
which
says
that
the
act
states
an
obligation
on
the
employer
that
that
obligation
was
understood
and
given
meaning
between
1935
and
1947,
and
the
board
cannot
write
that
obligation
out
of
the
law
and
substitute
for
it
a
privilege.
mr.
laurence
gold
to
that
extent,
to
the
extent
of
the
outline.
we
have
been
careful
in
our
brief
to
say
that
we
do
not
think
that
the
1935-1947
law
answers
the
question,
what
is
convincing
evidence?
what
are
the
circumstances
under
which
an
employer
must
bargain?
that's
why
we
didn't
cross-petition.
that's
why
we
think
that
that
question
is
properly
for
the
board
in
the
first
instance.
they've
never
addressed
it.
mr.
laurence
gold
that,
we
think,
is
the
one
option
which
was
removed.
that
was
the
one
thing
that
was
frozen
into
the--
mr.
laurence
gold
into
the
law.
mr.
laurence
gold
we
don't
see
how,
in
light
of
the
pr--
the
1935-1947
law
and
what
happened--
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
right.
we
think
that,
in
other
words,
if
the
house
had
prevailed,
it
would've
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
only
type
of
convincing
evidence--
mr.
laurence
gold
would
be
certification.
then,
congress
says
policy
would've
moved
to
the
point
of
requiring
an
election
in
every
case,
at
least
in
every
case
in
which
you
wanted
a
legal
enforcement.
mr.
laurence
gold
your
honor--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
i
am
perfectly
convinced
that
you
did
not
acquiesce.[laughter]
and,
therefore,
i
don't
have
to
deal
with
the
possibility
of
coming
here
and
arguing
that
a
prior
decision
was
mistaken.
first
of
all,
in
gissel,
chief
justice
warren,
with
what
we
think
was
care,
stated
the
question
that
was
before
the
court.
this
is
on
page
29
and
he
said,
i
think
this
is
the
first
sentence
of
the
opinion,
“these
cases
involve
the
extent
of
an
employer's
duty
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
recognize
a
union
that
bases
its
claim
to
representative
status
solely
on
the
possession
of
union
authorization
cards.”
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is
395
us
at
579.
that
was
the
issue.
the
union
was
arguing
that
employer
had
to
recognize
union
on
the
basis
of
cards
no
matter
what
the
unfair
labor--
no
matter--
whether
or
not
there
were
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
do
not--
mr.
laurence
gold
believe
that
it
did.
again,
we
discussed
this
at
some
length
in
terms
of
discussion
of
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b).
the
passage
of
the
court's
opinion
is
395
us
at
599-600,
and
all
the
court
said
there,
as
we
read
it,
is
that
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
supports
the
board
insofar
as
the
board
precluded
an
employer
from
committing
unfair
labor
practices
and
then
saying
that
the
union
had
to
secure
a
certification,
but
that
does
not
mean,
because
the
court
throughout
the
opinion
put
aside
the
union
objections,
to
say
that
a
section
supports
the
board
against
the
employer
doesn't
mean
that
it
supports
the
board's
view
against
later
objections
which
were
said
not
to
be
treated
in
the
opinion
to
the
board's
view.
and,
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
court's
opinion
with
the
possible
exception
of
that
passage
on
599-600
which
says
anything
which
it
supports
the
board's
position
here.
indeed,
we
think
that
gissel
stands--
is
the
logical
culmination
of
an
evolution.
starting
with
joy-silk
mills,
the
board
took
a
subjective
view
to
the
good
faith
doubt
standard
that
was
in
the
law
prior
to
1947.
we
read
the
pre-1947
cases
as
attemptings.
painstakingly,
it
may
be,
but
it
nevertheless
is
attempting
to
evolve
a
series
of
objective
criteria
to
measure
good
faith
doubt.
after
that,
the
board
had
a
standard.
at
times,
there's
a--
after
1947,
there
is
a
board
case
for
any
proposition,
but
we
read
the--
both
of
the
cases
going
out
from
joy-silk
mills
to
take
quite
a
subjective
view.
there
was
criticism
of
the
board's
position
in
two
respects.
one,
insofar
as
the
board
relied
on
authorization
cards.
authorization
cards
were
attacked
as
unreliable.
secondly,
there
was
intellectual
criticism
chiefly
from
judge
friendly
and
from
others,
interestingly
enough,
going
all
the
way
back
to
an
opinion
after
1947
by
judge
leonard
hand,
again
on
the
board's
view,
that
it
was
logical
to
impute
bad
faith
in
denying
recognition
from
subsequent
unfair
labor
practices.
judge
friendly
put
the
point
that
it
was
just
as
logical
to
believe
that
an
employer
could
make
sure
that
the
union
didn't
grant--
gained
a
majority
by
committing
unfair
labor
practices
as
that
he
believe
the
union
already
had
a
majority.
mr.
laurence
gold
that
was
the
passage
i
was
referring
to,
mr.
chief
justice,
discussion--
discussing--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
say,
that
was
the
passage
i
was
discussing
a
moment
ago
where
the
court
was
discussing
9
(c)
(1)
(b).
i
read
that
to
be,
one,
a
response
to
an
employer
contention
and,
two,
a
statement
of
the
board
law
as
it
stood
at
the
time
of
gissel
and
not
an
adoption
of
the
board's
reading
that
an
employer
can
always
secure
an
election.
i
think
that
they
are
all--
there
is
evidence
throughout
the
opinion,
one,
how
the
question
was
stated,
two,
the
citation
with
the
seeming
authority
of
mine
workers
versus
arkansas
oak
flooring.
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
right,
because--
mr.
laurence
gold
that
is--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
don't
think
it's
a
holding.
i
don't
even
think
it's
a
dictum,
mr.
chief
justice.
at
page
599,
that
paragraph
is
introduced
by
statement
“the
employers
rely
finely
on
the
addition
to
section
9
(c)
of
subparagraph
(b)
which
allows
an
employer
to
petition
for
an
election.”
and
then,
the
court
says
“that
provision
was
not
added
as
the
employer's
assert
to
give
them
an
absolute
right
to
an
election
at
any
time,
rather,
it
was
intended,
as
the
legislative
history
indicates,
to
allow
them,
after
being
asked
to
bargain,
to
test
out
their
doubts
as
to
a
union's
majority
in
a
secret
election
which
they
then--
which
would
then
presumably
not
cause
to
be
set
aside
by
a
legal
union
activity.
in
other
words,
the
court
started
out
by
quoting
the
language
from
the
senate
report
upon
which
we
relied.
then,
it
said
that,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
congress
only
intended
that
section
to
go
in
favor--
to
run
in
favor
of
an
employer
who
had
a
reasonable
doubt,
it
doesn't
run
in
favor
of
employers
who
don't
have
such
doubts
and
who
have
impeded
an
election.
and,
to
that
extent,
it
was
saying
that
the
board
was
right
in
issuing
bargaining
orders
against
employers
who
committed
unfair
labor
practices.
but,
there's
nothing
in
the
opinion
and
indeed,
at
the
start
of
the
opinion,
as
i've
pointed
out,
the
union's
positions
was--
were
put
aside.
the
union's
objections
to
the
board
law
were
put
aside
to--
and
not
treated.
we
don't
see
how
a--
that
case
can
be
considered
a
decision
which
freezes
the
board's
present
position
into
the
law.
indeed,
the
board
hadn't
gotten
this
far.
at
the
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
gissel
was
argued,
the
board
acknowledged
that
snow
&
sons
was
good
law
and
that
employers
would
have
an
obligation
if
they
knew.
the
board
was
taking
the
strange
position
that
an
employer
could
close
its
eyes,
had
no
obligation
to
look
around
him
but
if,
by
chance,
he
opened
his
eyes
and
found
out
something,
then
he
could
have
an
obligation
to
bargain.
and,
that
was
part
of
the
law
as--
the
board
law
as
it
stood.
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
right.
i
mean,
we
would
consider
it
to
be
an
erroneous
rule
to
say
that
any
time
an
employer
files,
that
frees
him
from
the
8
(a)
(5)
obligation,
as
i
have
stated
it.
but,
even
that
rule
is
different
from
the
board's
rule
or
from
the
rule
that
mr.
cohen
wants.
what
they
want
is
a
rule
that
the
employer
could
sit
there
no
matter
what
the
union
does
and
that
there
is
never
an
obligation
on
an
employer
so
long
as
he's
smart
enough
to
keep
his
eyes
closed
and
so
long
as
he
doesn't
commit
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
petition,
to
file
a
petition.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
the
board
does
not
take
the
position
that
an
employer
ever
has
to
do
anything
as
long
as
he
has
certain
negative
restraints
on
him,
as
someone
has
said.
mr.
laurence
gold
he
has
no
affirmative
obligations
under
section
8
(a)
(5).
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
sir,
and
i
believe
that
would
be
the
most,
and
as
i
say,
that
is
not
the
board's
position
nor
is
it
the
position
of
the
employer.
i
was
discussing
the
1947
amendments
and,
to
what
i've
already
said,
i
simply
wish
to
note
a
citation,
as
i've
mentioned,
the
only
document
we
cited
in
our
brief
is
the
house
conference
report
because
we
take
it
as
a
complete
acknowledgment
by
the
house
that
they
had
receded.
we'd
also
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
in
the
two-volume
legislative
history
of
the
nlra
at
page
1539,
senator
taft
inserted
his
explanation
of
the
conference
agreement
and,
there,
he
said
the
language
of
the
conference
agreement
is
identical
with
the
corresponding
provisions
in
the
senate
amendment
since
the
senate
conferees
refused
to
yield
to
the
house
with
respect
to
the
provisions
contained
in
the
house
bill
amending
the
provisions
in
section
8
(2)
relating
to
company-dominated
unions
and
subsection
8
(5)
relating
to
collective
bargaining.
this
means
that
the
five
unfair
labor
practices
contained
in
the
present
nlra
remain
unchanged.
now,
i
th--
it's
our
view
that
this
situation
is,
therefore,
the
same
as
the
curtis
bros.
case
in
362
us
24
which
is
reviewed
in
our
brief
at
pages
22-24
and
quoted
therein.
there,
the
board,
after
1947,
attempted
to
make
recognitional
picketing
by
a
minority
of
vile
and
unfair
labor
practice.
they
did
so
in
the
face
of
a
conference
report
which
said
there's
no
intent
to
make
recognitional
picketing
an
unfair
labor
practice.
they're
justification
was
we're
only
making
minority
recognitional
picketing
unlawful
and,
in
conference,
all
they
said
was
that
they
were
not
going
to
prohibit
all
recognitional
picketing
and
it
leaves
us
this
smaller
area
in
which
to
undermine,
if
i
may,
the
congressional
intent.
and,
the
court
said,
“absolutely
not.”
this
is
the
same
argument
that's
being
presented
here.
the
argument
being
presented
here
is
that
he
conferees
only
wanted
to
continue
the
power
of
the
board
to
issue
bargaining
orders
where
the
employer
committed
unfair
labor
practices.
there's
not
a
word
in
the
conference
report
to
suggest
that
indeed,
as
we
say,
when
you
put
all
the
pieces
together
the
language
of
the
act
which
creates
a
duty
and
which
doesn't
relate
it
to
violating
other
obligations
imposed
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
the
law
from
1935-1947,
by
the
language
of
the
house
conference
report,
the
language
of
senator
taft
in
the
senate,
what
they
were
doing
was
cuing
to
the
line
that
had
been
established
in
the
past.
we
think
the
board
has
to
cue
to
that
line,
not
in
any
particular,
not
as
to
whether
cards
are
enough
or
something
else
is
enough,
but
so
as
not
to
make
what
was
once
a
duty
into
a
privilege.
that,
we
think,
the
board
cannot
do.
i
wanted
to
say
some
other
things
about
gissle.
most
prominently,
the
fact
that
gissel
cites
with
approval
mine
workers
versus
arkansas
oak
flooring,
a
case
in
this
court,
a
preemption
case
but
a
pre-garment
preemption
case
which
is
cited
and
discussed
at
25-27
of
our
brief.
there,
the
court
stated
the
law
as
it
understood
it
at
that
time
after
1947.
they
said,
under
sections
8
(a)
(5)
and
9
(a)
and
by
virtue
of
the
conceded
majority
designation
of
the
union,
the
employer
is
obligated
to
recognize
the
designated
union.
“conceded”
there
was
used
in
the
term
of
uncontroverted,
as
we
indicate.
how
gissel
can
be
thought
to
close
the
door
on
us
here,
in
light
of
its
discussion
and
citation
of
mine
workers,
we
don't
understand,
nor
do
we
think
that
there's
any
logical
implication
from
the
fact
that
gissel
says
that
where
there
are
serious
unfair
labor
practices
there
shall
be
a
bargaining
order,
and
where
there
aren't
serious
unfair
labor
practices
there
shall
not
be.
the
court
in
gissel
was
discussing
the
remedial
power
of
the
board
to
remedy
a
section
8
(a)
(1).
as
i
started
to
say,
the
evolution
had
been
to
criticize
the
board's
good
faith
test
insofar
as
that
test
made
the
existence
of
other
unfair
labor
practices
a
basis
for
a
finding
of
good
faith.
and,
what
gissel
did
and
what
the
board
did
at
about
the
time
of
gissel
was
to
clean
up
this
area
and
to
say
that,
logically,
what
we
are
doing
is
entering
an
order
to
remedy
the
other
unfair
labor
practice.
we're
really
not
making
a
finding
of
fact
as
to
whether
the
u--
the
employer
had
good
faith
doubt
in
refusing
recognition
in
the
first
place.
and,
at
pages
32
and
33
of
our
brief,
we
cite
and
discuss
a
case
called
steel-fab
inc.,
a
very
recent
board
decision,
which
the
board
says
precisely
what
i'm
trying
to
say
here.
that
what
gissel
did
was
talk
about
the
board's
power
under
section
10
(c),
it's
power
to
remedy
illegal
discharges,
illegal
interrogations
and
so
on,
but
it
didn't
say
what
8
(a)
(5)
means.
and,
what
the
board
is
really
trying
to
do
here
is
to
say
that
8
(a)
(5)
means
nothing.
there
is
no
obligation
on
an
employer
strictly
by
8
(a)
(5),
no
obligation
to
recognize
the
union
selected
or
designated,
only
an
obligation
to
recognize
a
union
certified,
not
only
certified
but
a
union
that
has
gone
and
gotten
its
certification.
and,
why
do
we
care?
i
think
that's
really
the
last
question.
i
think
that
everything
i've
said
thus
far
indicates
that
we're
right
on
the
law,
but
why
do
we
care?
and,
the
reason
we
care
is
that
the
law
that
the
board
has
adopted
that
the
employers
want
here
creates
employer
free
choice.
the
employer
has
a
free
choice
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
will
be
an
election.
if
he
wants
an
election,
there'll
be
an
election.
if
he
wants
to
recognize
the
union,
he
can.
that
is
an
employee
free
choice.
there
are
times
when
people
have
manifested
their
desire
so
clearly
that
there's
no
longer
a
real
question.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
it's
employer
free
choice.
sure,
the
union
can
petition
for
an
election.
if
it
wants
to
go
through
the
more
time-consuming
route,
it
can.
the
only
question
is
whether
congress
said
that
it
had
to.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
but
the
employer
has
everything
to
gain
by
that
play.
as
mr.
cohen
quite
candidly
said,
what
the
employer
wants
is
to
wait
as
long
as
possible.
i
don't
know
of
any
union
which
has
ever
petitioned
for
an
election
when
the
employer
has
come
to
them
and
say
“please,
please
don't
petition
for
an
election.
we
will
recognize
you
now.”
the
union
wants
the
recognition.
normally,
the
employer
doesn't.
if
they
both
want
the
recognition,
there's
never
an
election
at
all.
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
the
case
where
the
employer
says
“i
won't
recognize
you.”
mr.
laurence
gold
it
doesn't
solve
their
problems,
as
i'm
starting
to
say,
in
that
it
takes
a
long
time
and
gives
the
employer
all
sorts
of
options
to
delay
bargaining
and--
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
our
real
objection
is
that
the
employer
can
play
it
either
way.
if
the
employer
doesn't
like
elections
and
he
wants
to
recognize,
there's
nothing
that
stops
him.
on
the
other
hand,
congress
said
that
in
this
statute
that
the
employer
was
supposed
to
have
a
duty,
a
duty
to
recognize.
and,
the
question
is,
what
is
the
precondition?
and,
what
the
board
is
saying
here
is
that
the
employer
has
the
option.
he
can
either
have
an
election
or
not.
if
the
union
is
knocking
at
the
door
and
he
doesn't
want
to
accord
them
recognition.
we
don't
think
that
congress
has
said
there
has
to
be
an
election
every
case.
the
logic
of
the
situation
is
that
that
clogs
the
machinery.
it
gives
the
employer
a
chance
to
dissipate
the
majority.
there's
been
much
talk
in
the
employer's
brief
about
the
franks
brothers
case.
it
was
a
case
in
which
unfair
labor
practices
were
committed,
but
this
is
what
mr.
justice
black
said
“the
unlawful
refusal
of
an
employer
to
bargain
collectively
with
its
employees,
chosen
representatives,
disrupts
the
employee's
morale,
deters
their
organizational
activities,
and
discourages
their
membership
in
unions.
we
think
that's
true.
there
are
cases
in
which
employees
are
willing
to
manifest
their
desire
to
be
represented
in
a
way
in
which
the
employer
can
check.
where
that
is
the
case,
we
think
that
congress
has
determined
by
keeping
the
words
“selected
or
designated”
by
ratifying
the
pre-1935
law
to
let
them
do
so.
that
it
hasn't
gone
to
the
proposition
that
its
policy
has
not
yet
moved
to
the
point
of
requiring
an
election
no
matter
how
strong
the
union's
proof
is.
i
want
to
say
one
word
in
my
few
remaining
seconds
on
section
8
(b)
(7).
this
is
the
second
case
this
term
where
section
8
(b)
(7)
has
been
dragged
in
by
its
heels,
by
counsel
on
a
post-taft
basis.
the
first
was
the
important
case
which
was
argued
a
few
months-
a
month
or
so
ago.
in
that
case,
the
board
relied
somewhat
on
8
(b)
(7)
even
though
the
board
decision
had
not
touched
8
(b)
(7),
and
even
though
the
union
argued
that
there
was
no
picketing
there
but
only
hand-billing.
here,
there
is
an
explicit
board
holding
at
page
171
of
the
nlrb
petition
appendix
that
8
(b)
(7)
is
irrelevant
here
because
there
is
no--
because
8
(b)
(7)
does
not
relate
to
situations
in
which
the
employer
has
illegally
refuse
to
bargain.
nevertheless,
both
mr.
cohen
and
mr.
come
have
stood
up
here
and
argued
that
section
8
(b)
(7)
supports
their
view
of
the
statute.
we
think
that
that's
completely
impermissible.
mr.
laurence
gold
just
two
points.
with
respect
to
gissel,
of
course
the
court
is
in
the
best
position
to
know
what
it
held
in
gissel.
however--
