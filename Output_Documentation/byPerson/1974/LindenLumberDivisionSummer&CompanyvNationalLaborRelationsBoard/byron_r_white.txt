justice
byron
r.
white
now,
has
that
always
been
the
board's
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
you're
also
forced
along
that
line
to
say
that
not
only
is
the
employer
entitled
to
an
election,
but
he
need
not
file
a
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
made
him
file
a
petition,
you'd
be
immediately
back
in
trying
to
figure
out
when
he
has
to
file
a
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
show
good
faith.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
filing
a
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
would
mean
getting
right
back,
again,
to
figuring
out
when
it
is
he
has
to
file
a
petition.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
really
isn't
much--
there
really--
mr.
come,
there
really
isn't
much
trouble
in
determining
when
there's
a
card
majority
on
the
face
of
things
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
said
“well,
if
there's
a
card
majority,
the
employer
ought
to
at
least
file
a
petition
rather
than
sit
and
wait.”
now,
what's
so
difficult
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
the
merits
of
the
issue
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
just
a
litigation
avoidance
rationale
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
if
there--
it
doesn't
appear
on
the
face
of
it
to
be
a
whole
lot
of
merit
in
saying
that
the--
that
an
employer,
who
was
faced
with
a
card
majority
plus
a
picket
line
by
a
majority
of
the
bargaining
unit,
can
just
shrug
it
off
and
not
even
file
a
petition.
there
must
be
some
reason
the
board
had
for
saying
he
can
sit
and
wait.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
not
suggesting,
nevertheless,
that
the
board
might
not,
for
reasons
dealing
with
the
general
administration
of
the
act,
conclude
“no,
he
must
file
them.”
merely
because
the
statute
doesn't
say
so
in
so
many
words,
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
board's
powerless
to
require,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
did.
you
already--
you
have.
it
doesn't
go
further
than
that.
that
is
in
the
old
joy-silk.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
they
bargained,
there
were
a--
there
was
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
didn't
bargain,
he'd
leave
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
joy-silk
if
there
was
a
part
majority
or
independent
knowledge.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
board
doctrine
in
1947?
wasn't--
weren't
you
requiring
bargaining
by
employers
without
an
election?
i
thought
that
was--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wasn't
that
what
congress
was--
they
legislated
against
that
background,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
did
it--
it
didn't
make
a
new
doctrine,
joy-silk?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
joy-silk
make
a
new
doctrine
or
was
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
reflective
of
prior--
of
stated
law,
existing
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cohen,
right
along
that
line,
i'm--
i
still
am
a
little
unclear
of
what--
as
to
what
your
position
is
with
respect
to
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
1947
act.
you
say
in
your
brief,
“to
be
sure--“
at
page
12,
“to
be
sure
of
the
finding
in
gissel
where
an
employer
did
not
have
a
good
faith
doubt
as
the
union
majority
status,
where
there
did
not
exist
a
bonafided
dispute,
a
bargaining
order
could
issue.”
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
said
a
while
ago
that
there's
never
been
an
instance
there--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
were
there
before
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
somebody
asks--
if
someone
knowledgeable
in
labor
law
ask--
was
asked
could
a
bargaining
order
issue--
justice
byron
r.
white
absent
of
good
faith
doubt
and
absent
of
unfair
labor
practices,
you'd
say
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then,
you
do
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
taft-hartley
act--
that
after
taft-hartley
you
would
answer
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
specific
provision
do
you
say
changes
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
didn't--
it
doesn't--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
the
board
would
agree--
the
board
agreed
with
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
agree
with
you
then
and
it
doesn't
apparently
agree
with
you
today.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
the
way
the
board
described
joy-silk
to
us
today.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
court
of
appeals
said
as
long
as
the
employer
files,
he
can
escape
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
the
board
did
adopt
the
rule
that,
absent
other
unfair
labor
practices,
absent
agreement,
there's
no
reason
to
bar
it
as
long
as
the--
until
and
unless
there
is
a
certification
after
an
employer's
request
of
an
election.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
would
accept
that,
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
in
that
sense,
you
are
saying
that
you're
disagreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
think
that
would
be
satisfied
by
a
rule
that
the
employer
could
always
refuse
to
bargain
as
long
as
sought
an
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gold,
do
you
read
the
gissel
as--
do
you
think
that
the
court--
this
court
acquiesced
in
the
board's
abandonment
of
the
good
faith
test
in
gissel?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
we
did,
i
take
it
you
think
we
made
a
mistake.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
didn't
the
opinion,
or
didn't
it,
pretty
clearly
indicate
that,
absent
unfair
labor
practices,
the
board--
that
the
employer
could
petition
for
an
election
and
not
have
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
there's
nothing
in
gissel,
i
take
it,
suggesting
that
even
if
the
employer
has
the
right
to
file,
that
he
has
to,
or
that
he
can
just
sit
and
wait
for
somebody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
might
have
the
right
to
file
without
bargaining.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
that
reach
independent
knowledge?
