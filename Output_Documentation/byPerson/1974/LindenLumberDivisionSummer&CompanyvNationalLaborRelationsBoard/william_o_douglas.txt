justice
william
o.
douglas
these
cases
involve
a
question
of
elections
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
of
when
--
who
has
the
obligation
of
going
forward
after
an
impasse
has
been
reached.
in
this
case,
the
employer
was
not
guilty
of
any
unfair
labor
practice,
entered
into
no
agreement
to
settle
it
by
means
other
than
the
election
conducted
by
the
board
and
there
was
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
the
union
represented
the
employees
that
it
purported
to
represent.
we
conclude
that
within
the
statutory
system
as
we
read
it,
at
that
junction
the
duty
was
on
the
labor
union
to
ask
for
the
board's
action
to
invoke
the
power
of
the
board
to
conduct
an
election.
our
reasons
are
elaborated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
white,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
mr.
justice
powell
joined.
