justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
you
referred
to
the
law
between
1935
and
1947
to
the
dahlstrom
case
which
enforced
a
board
order,
i
believe.
is
it
your
position
that
the
board
couldn't
have
taken
any
position
than
it
did
in
view
of
the
statute
between
1935
and
1947?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
congress
froze
it
then
in
1947?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
employer
free
choice,
but
the
union
can
petition
for
an
election.
it
does--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you--
when
you
say
employer
free
choice,
you
give
the
impression
that
the
decision
is
solely
in
the
hands
of
the
employer
but
the
union,
if
it
petitions
for
an
election,
takes
the
play
away
from
the
employer.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
can't
the
union
petition
for
an
election?
why
doesn't
that
solve
their
problem?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
your
real
criticism
isn't
that
it
gives
employer
free
choice,
but
that
you
don't
like
elections.
