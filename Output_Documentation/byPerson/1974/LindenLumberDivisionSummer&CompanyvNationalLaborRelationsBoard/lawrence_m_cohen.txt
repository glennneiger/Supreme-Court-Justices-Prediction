mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
agree
with
the
labor
board
that
where
an
employer
does
not
commit
unfair
labor
practices
and
preclude
a
fair
election,
a
bargaining
order
based
on
either
cards
or
picket
lines
or
both
or
other
secondary
indicia
of
employer's--
employee
support
should
not
issue.
at
the
heart
of
this
issue,
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
is
really
a
fundamental
disagreement
as
to
the
direction
and
policy
of
our
national
labor
act.
let
me
try
and
summarize
what
i
believe
the
union's
position
is
this--
is
thusly.
the
unions
argued
not
only
the
cards
or
picket
lines
should
be
an
interchangeable
substitute
with
elections,
that
actually
they
should
be
preferred
to
elections.
the
unions
argue
that
the
policy
of
our
labor
act
at
the
time
of
the
wagner
act
has
remained
unchanged,
that
it
is
to
promote
unionization.
that
elections,
since
they
take
longer,
since
unions
loose
more
elections
than
they
do
in
a
case
of
obtaining
cards,
should
not
be
used
unless
there
is
a
bonafide
dispute
as
to
whether
the
cards
or
the
picket
lines
evidence
employee
support.
where
there
is
a
bonafide
dispute,
then
there
should
be
an
election.
where
there
is
no
bonafide
dispute,
then
the
cards
or
the
secondary
indicia
should
speak
for
themselves.
we
disagree
with
this
position.
we
think
it's
contrary
to
the
intent
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments
to
the
act.
we
think
it's
contrary
to
this
court's
reasoning
and
the
logic
of
its
opinion
in
the
gissel
case.
at
least
since
1947,
the
board
has
never,
and
i
emphasize
“never,”
held
that
cards
or
sec--
or
picket
line
activity,
in
it
of
itself
where
there's
no
unfair
labor
practices,
is
the
basis
for
a
bargaining
order.
since
the
taft-hartley
amendments
were
added
to
the
act,
the
policy
of
the
act
has
been
not
to
promote
unionization
but
to
promote
three
reasoned,
informed
employee
choice.
that
was
the
entire
thrust
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments
to
the
act.
an
election,
as
we
thought
this
court
made
clear
in
gissel,
is
the
preferred
means,
not
other
means,
and
other
means
are
only
to
be
used
where,
in
the
language
of
the
franks
brothers
case,
to
prevent
an
employer
from
profiting
by
his
own
wrong
doing
or
where
an
election
is
not
possible
because
an
employer
is
precluded
by
his
unfair
labor
practices.
where
an
election
is
possible,
where
a
free
election
is
possible,
then
that
ought
to
be
the
courts
that's
used.
there
are
many
indications,
we
think,
of
this
congressional
intent
and
this
change
in
the
direction
of
the
act
at
the
time
of
taft-hartley.
first
of
all,
and
the
real
thrust
of
the
law
which
now,
as
this
court
stated
last
term
in
the
savair
case,
is
one
of
neutrality
to
our
collective
bargaining,
not
promotion
of
collective
bargaining.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
think
that
joy--
the
question
really
is,
in
joy-silk
there
were
unfair
labor
practices,
the
question
that's
really
before
the
court
is
a
gloss
on
the
joy-silk
doctrine
in
a
sense
of
whether
where
there
are
no
unfair
labor
practices
standing
alone,
the
so-called
snow
&
sons
independent
knowledge
question,
if
in
joy-silk
there
were
unfair
labor
practices
and
the
board,
at
all
times
after
1947
with
the
exception
of
the
renege
type
situation
that
mr.--
which
was
actually
snow
&
sons
that
mr.
come
alluded
to,
except
for
that
kind
of
renege
exception,
the
board
uniformly
did
ever
issue
bargaining
orders
where
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practices.
that
was
secretary
of
labor
wirtz's
position
when
he
testified
during
the
amendments
to
the
act.
that
was
the
position
that
the
board
expressly
stated
in
1966
in
the
aaron
brothers
case
that
this
court
referred
to
in
gissel
and
has
been,
in
as
far
as
we've
been
able
to
research
in
any
other
commentator,
the
uniform
position
of
the
board.
one
commentator,
as
cited
in
our
brief,
said
that
no
board
member
has
even
suggested
going
as
far
as
the
unions
would
propose
at
any
time
since
1947.
so,
in
our
opinion,
there's
no
change
in
direction
of
the
board
policy
in
this
case,
merely
a
reaffirmation
of
what
it
has
been
long-standing
board
policy
required
by
the
congressional
intent
manifested
in
taft-hartley.
taft-hartley
added,
for
example,
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
to
the
act.
this
provision,
as
this
court
stated
in
gissel,
fully
supports
the
board's
present
administration
of
the
act.
before
an
employer
can
insist
on
a
secret
ballot
election
unless,
in
the
words
of
the
board,
he
engages
in
contemporaneous
unfair
labor
practices,
likely
destroy
the
union's
majority
and
impede
the
election.
so,
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
does
not,
as
the
unions
argue
here,
detract
from
the
board's
policy
nor,
as
the
court
of
appeals
argues,
should
it
impose
an
independent
requirement.
it
supports
the
board's
policy.
the
employer
has
an
option.
he
can
let
the
union
file
a
petition
and
do
nothing
or
he
can,
if
he
wishes,
go
in
and
file
his
own
petition.
there
was
an
addition
in
taft-hartley,
section
8
(c),
added
to
the
act.
it
is--
the
purpose
of
section
8
(c),
we
submit,
is
to
permit
an
employer
to
articulate
his
views
on
the
reasons
why
employees
should
not
choose
unions.
it
wish
to
inform
employees
and
permit
them
to
consider
the
question
in
a
light
of
an
election
with
the
knowledge
of
both
sides.
there
is
also
the
expressed
writing
added
in
taft-hartley
that
employees
can--
may
refrain
from
unionization,
that
the
unions
cannot
interfere
with
that
policy.
taft-hartley,
as
well
as
the
landrum-griffin
amendments
to
the
act,
curtailed
recognition
picketing,
secondary
boycotts,
use
of
union
power
to
try
and
obtain
recognition
and
there
was
also
the
requirement
added
that
certification
could
only
issue
in
the
purpose--
in
the
case
of
an
election
and
decertification
and
so
on
as
we've
spelled
out
in
our
brief.
the
thrust
of
all
these
changes
was
not
to
promote
and
cur--
continue
to
promote
unionization
but
to,
instead,
direct
the
act
at
employee
free
choice.
it
was
to
channel
claims
for
recognition
into
the
election
area
unless
there
was
either
voluntary
recognition
or
unless
the
employer
preclude
the
use
of
election
machinery.
since
ha--
taft-hartley,
as
i've
indicated,
the
board
has
repeatedly
recognized
this
principle.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
excuse
me.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
two
alternatives.
the
employer
voluntarily
recognized
that
the
union
and--
either
conditionally
subject
to
third-party
checking
of
cards
or
does
it
without
any
condition,
then
of
course
there's
no
election.
if
he
interferes
with
the
election,
as
gissel
made
clear
about
by
substantial
unfair
labor
practices
so
that
there
can
be
no
fair
election,
then
of
course
the
election
machinery
can't
be
used
either.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it's
an
affirmative
act
of
the
employer
that
requires
resort
to
secondary
evidence
because
the
primary
evidence
of
the
election
is
not
available,
and
i
think
this
is--
this
points
out
another
anomaly
in
the
union's
position.
if,
as
this
court
said
in
gissel
where
you
have
minimal
interference
with
an
election,
no
bargaining
order
should
issue,
then
how
can
you
have
an
interf--
how
can
you
have
a
bargaining
order
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
there
is
no
interference
whatsoever
with
the
election
process?
that's
where
we
think
this
case,
in
the
union's
position,
is
if
not
required
by
the
expressed
language
of
gissel,
because
the
case
was--
the
question
was
reserved
there,
as
required
by
the
logic
of
gissel.
let
me
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
and
why
we
think
that's
really
an
incorrect
compromise,
if
you
will,
between
the
different
positions.
contrary
to
mr.
come,
we
would
take
the
position
that
the
board
has
no
power
even
if
it
wanted
to,
which
it
has
not,
to
require
an
employer
to
file
an
election
petition.
that
would
impose
an
obligation
no
required
by
the
act.
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
permits
but
does
not
require
an
employer
election
petition.
in
fact,
that
idea
was
suggested
at
the
time
of
the
taft-hartley
amendments
and
rejected.
to
quote
a
couple
of
sentences
from
a
fourth
circuit
decision
in
logan
packing,
“it
was
made
plain
of
the
taft-hartley
committee
reports
that
an
employer,
after
receipt
of
a
demand
to
bargain
from
a
union
claiming
to
represent
a
majority
of
employees,
need
not
petition
for
an
election.”
he
had
the
alternative
of
waiting
for
the
union
to
invoke
the
board's
election
process,
but
he
was
assured
of
an
election
at
his
own
petition
if
the
union
sought
to
obtain
recognition
by
a
means
other
than
an
election.
the
second
defect
in
the
court
of
appeals'
position,
as
mr.
come
has
pointed
out,
is
that
it
resurrects
the
good
faith
doubt
test.
“when
should
an
employer
have
to
petition?
why
should
they
have
to
petition
that
evidence
is
good
faith?”
says
the
court
of
appeals.
that
returns
one
to
the
whole
joy-silk
subjective
intent
quagmire.
there
is
no
way
to
ascertain
subjective
good
faith.
there's
no
need
to
obtain
in
subjective
good
faith.
we
think,
third,
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
is
be--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's--
we
said
the
board--
no,
what
we've
suggested
is
that
the
board
could
not
require
an
employer
to
file
an
election
petition.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
what
we
would
do.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct,
and
i
think
there's--
all
i'm
trying
to
point
out,
mr.
justice
brennan,
was
that
there
are
some
policy
reasons
for
the
board
not
doing
so.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
the
act
requires
either
party
to
petition
for
an
election.
i
think
that's
demonstrated
by
the
8
(b)
(7)
section
that
mr.
come
alluded
to,
8
(b)
(7)
presu--
permits
recognition
picketing
to
go
on
unless
either
party
files
a
petition.
now,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
that
the
employer
has
to
file
a
petition,
that
option
is
lost.
the
employer
can't
simply
sit
back,
let
the
union
engage
in
recognition
picketing,
and
do
nothing.
he's
required
to
go
in
and
file
a
petition
which
automatically
removes
the
time
bar,
the
30-day
period,
in
section
8
(b)
(7)
(c).
it's
inconsistent
to
say,
on
one
hand,
employers
can
sit
back
and
let
the
union
picket
for
30
days
and
then
it's
over
if
a
petition
hasn't
been
filed
and,
second
hand,
say
the
employer
must
go
in
and
file
a
petition
which,
in
effect,
removes
the
30-day
time
bar.
to
answer
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question,
why
do
unions
want
employers,
let's
say,
to
file
a
petition?
well,
first
of
all,
it
removes
the
30%
interest
showing.
unions
can--
if
an
employer
files
a
petition,
the
union
doesn't
have
to
have
any
interest
showing
and
the
result
is
that,
at
that
point,
election
is
held.
the
union
could
win
the
election
without
ever
having
established
the
30%
requirement
that
it
would
have
to
do
if
it
filed
its
own
petition.
it
enables,
secondly,
a
union
to
control
the
timing
and
the
duration.
unions
frequently
demand
recognition
and
proposed
with--
at
the
peak
of
their
organizational
campaign.
so
that,
if
an
employer
is
required
to
file
as
soon
as
a
union
demands
recognition,
there's
no
time
hiatus
between
the
filing
of
the
petition
and
the
union's
demand
for
recognition.
now,
the--
and,
any
alter--
any
possibility
that
the
employer,
during
that
period,
can
engage
in
campaigning.
unions
traditionally
want
to
speed
up
the
election
process
because,
as
soon
after
they
have
organized
as
possible,
they
would
like
the
election.
employers
traditionally
take
the
opposite
point
of
view.
the
more
time
that
elapses,
the
more
opportunity
employees
have
to
hear
the
other
side,
the
better
the
chance
of
employer's
success
and
the
better--
the
less
chance
the
unions
are
going
to
win
the
election.
so,
the
thrust
of
the
court
of
appeals'
argument
is
that
this
supposedly
would
avoid
delay.
well,
it
doesn't
do
so
because
of
the
union
file--
if
the
employer
files
a
petition,
the
union
can
say
“we
don't
want
that
unit,”
and
the
board
will
then
dismiss
the
petition.
the
unions
may
still
say
“well,
we're
willing
to
take
that
unit,
but
we
have
some
disagreement
over
the
composition
of
the
voting
unit.”
again,
what
would
happen
in
that
case
is
there's
a
hearing
required,
and
the
hearing
would
be
the
same
kind
of
hearing
with
the
same
boar
processes
as
would
take
place
in
the
case
of
an
employer
petition.
so,
the
problem
with
an
employer
required
petition
is,
first,
it's
not
required
by
the
act,
it's
contrary
to
the
committee
reports,
it
doesn't
avoid
delay,
and
it's
unfair
to
employees.
and,
for
all
these
reasons,
we
get
back
to
the
basic
principle
which
we
have
argued
to
this
court
that,
unless
there
are
unfair
labor
practices,
one
should
look
to
the
primary
function
of
an
election
which
is
the
whole
thrust
of
the
act
to
resolve
the
question
“do
employees
want
or
don't
want
a
union?”
and,
looking
to
that
primary
thrust,
it's
only
when
the
employers
precluded
it
that
the
union
should
not
have
to
test
its
claim
in
the
crucible
of
an
election.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
there
were
some
language
in
cases
prior
to
taft-hartley,
the
dahlstrom
case,
other
case
that
the
union
talks
about
where
they
imply
that
a
bargaining
could--
order
could
issue
if
there
were
no
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
since
1947
was
my
position
that
there
has
been
no
c--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there
was
no--
there
were
cases
which
had
the
language,
but
there
were
no
case
in
which
the
board
imposed
such
an
order.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
that
it
was--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
we're
talking
about
the
time
of
taft-hartley.
i
think
that
one
would
look
to
cases
and
say
“probably
yes,
but
we
don't
know.”
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
don't
think
there
was
any
board
case
that
came
out
saying
so.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct,
and
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
what
provision
changed?
it
was
all
the
provisions
that
i've
enumerated:
9
(c)
(1)
(b),
8
(c),
section
7,
and
so
on,
the
whole
pro--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
whole
change
in
professional
objective.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
significant
fact
is,
since
1947,
the
board
recognized
a
change
in
direction.
it's
never
suggested
going
as
far
as
the
union
has
done.
there's
no
case
that's
ever
done
it,
and
what
the
unions
are
asking
for
here
is
something
that
hasn't
occurred
at
any
time
since
the
taft-hartley
act
and
may
or
may
not
have
been
permissible
prior
to
taft-hartley.
mr.

cohen
well,
it's
the
way
the
board
attempted
to
describe
joy-silk
in
aaron
brothers.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
and
the
way
it
clearly
described
joy-silk
when
it
got
to
gissel.
i
think
there's
some
confusion
in
the
board
cases
that
was
unfortunate.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
i
think
it's
the
only
permissible
one.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
but
i
don't
have
to
go
s--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
don't
have
to
argue
that.
that's--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that's
correct.
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
the
second
part
of
the
sentence
is
the
error.
i
think
the
first
part
factually,
in
most
cases,
is
not
correct.
it
would
not
expedite
the
election
process
and
i
think
there's
no
reason,
based
on
the
arguments
i've
given,
that
it
should
ever
be
taken
as
evidence
if
they
had
faith
or
evidence
to
support
a
bargaining
order.
