chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
73-1231
and
consolidated
with
73-123,
linden
lumber
division
against
the
labor
board
and
the
labor
board
against
the
truck
drivers
union.
mr.
come,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
the
court
left
that
open.
there
wasn't
any
occasion
for
the
court
to
address
that
question
at
all
in
gissel,
was
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
case
in
controversy
then
presented
to
the
court,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that
was
the
fulcrum
of
the
decision.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
picketing
is
sort
of
a
demonstrative
election,
is
that
the
idea?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
what
circumstances,
mr.
come,
is
a
union
ever--
the
employees
ever
compelled
to
file
petition
for
an
election?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
have
the
right
to
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
another
way
of
saying
it
is
they
can't
continue
the
picketing
for
more
than
30
days
if
they
do
not
file
a
petition.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
stress
of
the
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
indicated
earlier
that
the
board
tends
to
discount
pressures
of
picketing
for
recognition
because
of
the
bandwagon
aspect.
you
think
there's
any
less
or
more
bandwagon
aspect
to
card
signing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
as
much,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
documentary
aspect
of
it
is
very
forceful
psychologically,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
the
board
ever
indicated
that
in
any
affirmative
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
it's
a
secret
ballot?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
bandwagon
aspect
of
either
crowding
people
into
a
picket
line
or
pressing
cards
on
them
isn't
present
in
the
balloting.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
come.
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
precluded
it--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
include
interfering
with
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
fairly--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
interference
in
that
sense
is
an
affirmative
act,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
policy
reasons
would
be
somewhat
similar
to
the
reasons
why
the--
you
would
consider
that
the
board
had
no
authority
to
force
the
union
to
demand
an
election.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
cohen,
let
me
read
you
just
one
sentence
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
and
see
what
your
reaction
is
to
that.
the
statement
is
when
an
employer
petitions
for
or
consents
to
an
election,
the
election
process
is
expedited.
if
he
declines
to
exercise
this
option,
he
must
take
the
risk
that
his
conduct
as
a
whole,
in
the
context
of
convincing
evidence
of
majority
support,
may
be
taken
as
a
refusal
to
bargain.
would
you
say
that's
the
heart
of
the
error
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
aren't
you
converting
an
option
into
an
obligation
by
this
argument
that
you're
making,
the
option
that's
been
extended
to
an
employer
as
it
is
extended
to
the
workman
to
call
for
an
election?
now,
you're
converting
that
into
an
obligation.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
so,
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
speaking
in
terms
of
the
option,
the
option
to
seek
an
election.
these
other
alternatives
are
all
a
series
of
things
leading
up
to
the
same
end
result
with
all
of
your
young
men.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
they're
not
exercised--
up
to
now,
has
it
not
been
thought
clear
that
the
union
has
an
option
at
its
choice
to
call
for
an
election
and
if
the
employer
has
an
option
to
call
for
an
election
and
that
neither
one
is
compelled
to
do
so,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wasn't
gissel--
the
holding
of
the
court
in
gissel
regarded
as
a
departure
in
the
sense
that
it
said
that
the
option
of
the
employer
is
lost
in
circumstances
where
the
employer
has
done
something
to
interfere
with
the
probability
of
a
free
choice.
isn't
that
the
essence
of
the
gissel
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
didn't
think
gissel--
the
gissel
holding
startled
anyone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
bargain
on
what,
on
everything?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
of
the
original
opinion
is
the
other
jump
site?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
the
court
meant
in
the
gissel
case?
page
600
where
the
court
said
“for
an
employer
can
insist
on
a
secret
ballot,
unless,”
in
the
words
of
the
board,
“he
engages
in
contemporaneous
unfair
labor
practices
likely
to
destroy
the
union's
majority
and
seriously
impede
a
fair
election.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
think
the
gissel
court
meant
by
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
to
save
time,
i
had
read
only
the
latter
part
of
it.
the
language
that
i
just
read
to
you
was
preceded
by
the
statement
by
this
court.
i'm
not
quoting
anyone.
and,
we
agree
that
the
policies
reflected
in
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
fully
support
the
board's
present
administration
of
the
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
going
on,
“for
an
employer
can
insist
on
a
secret
ballot.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
what
is
unequivocal
to
a
holding
of
the
court
as
you
could
find?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
do
you
have
anything
further?
you
have
about
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
some
of
us
are.[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
come.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
douglas
will
also
announce
the
judgment
--
opinion
of
the
court
in
73-1231
and
1234,
linden
lumber
division
against
the
labor
board
and
the
related
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
douglas.
