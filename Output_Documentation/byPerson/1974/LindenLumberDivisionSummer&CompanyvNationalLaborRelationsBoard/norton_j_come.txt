mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
and
they
present
a
question
which
was
left
open
by
this
court
in
the
gissel
packing
case
in
395
us.
in
gissel,
the
court
sustained
the
board's
authority
to
require
an
employer
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
a
union
that
based
its
claim
to
represent
to
the
status
on
the
possession
of
union
authorization
cards
where
the
employer
had
engaged
in
independent
unfair
labor
practices
that
tended
to
preclude
the
holding
of
a
fair
election.
the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide
whether
a
bargaining
order
based
on
cards
or
some
other
showing
of
employee
support
other
than
a
board
election
is
ever
appropriate
in
cases
where
there's
no
interference
with
the
election
processes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
union
had
urge
a
broader
position
which
is
the
equivalent
of
their
position
here
and--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct
because,
there,
there
were
unfair
labor
practices
which
tended
to
preclude
the
holding
of
a
fair
election.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
the
fulcrum
of
the
decision.
however,
we
believe
that
the
rationale
in
the
court's
reasoning
is
relevant
to
the
problem
that
we
have
here,
as
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment.
there
are
two
board
cases
here
which
were
consolidate
for
purposes
of
briefing
an
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
board's
petition.
the
first
involves
the
linden
lumber
company
which
manufactures
prefabricated
homes
and
the
second
involves
wilder
manufacturing
company,
a
manufacturer
of
cooking
utensils.
the
essential
facts
of
both
cases
are
similar
and
i'll
briefly
sketch
them
out.
in
both
cases,
the
union,
the
teamsters
in
linden
and
the
textile
workers
in
wilder,
signed
authorization
cards
from
a
majority
of
the
company's
employees
in
a
unit
later
found
to
be
appropriate.
there
are
11
out
of
11
plus
the
card
of
1
employee
who
was
found
to
be
a
supervisor
in
linden,
and
11
out
of
18
in
wilder.
the
union
requested
recognition,
and
in
linden,
the
company
that
request
with
a
petition
of
the
board
for
a
representation
election.
in
both
cases,
the
company
denied
the
recognition
request.
in
linden,
the
company
did
so
and
refused
to
consent
to
an
election
on
the
union's
petition
because
of
its
belief
that
supervisors
had
assisted
in
the
union's
organizational
effort.
the
card
signers
included
schaeffer
and
marsh
whom
the
company
contended
were
supervisors.
the
board
subsequently
found
that
marsh
was
not
a
supervisor.
that
schaeffer
was,
but
that
his
conduct
did
not
taint
the
union's
majority.
in
wilder,
the
company
refused
recognition
because
of
its
belief
that
the
unit
was
larger
than
18,
which
was
ultimately
found
to
be
the
appropriate
unit
and,
thus,
the
union
did
not
have
a
majority
in
the
larger
unit.
and,
before
the
board,
there
was
a
contest
as
to
whether
seven
technical
employees
whom
the
company
claimed
should
have
been
included
in
the
unit
were
in
fact
in
the
unit.
the
board
resolved
that
against
the
company.
in
linden,
the
union
withdrew
its
representation
petition
and,
in
both
cases,
the
employees
struck
and
established
picket
lines
in
front
of
the
plant.
in
linden,
8
of
the
11
card
signers
participated
in
this
activity,
at
least
at
the
outset,
and
in
wilder,
all
of
the
11
original
card
signers
did.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
would've
been
entitled
to
petition
for--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
but
the
board
also
took
the
position
that
the
employer
was
no
required
to
petition
for
an
election.
that
if
the
employer
merely
rejected
the
card
showing
with
no
comment,
it
would
not--
he
would
not
be
guilty
of
a
refusal
to
bargain.
that
he
could
file
a
petition
if
he
wanted
to.
the
union,
likewise,
could
file
a
petition
because,
in
the
board's
view,
an
election
was
the
most
reliable
and
the
quickest
way
of
resolving
the
situation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
is
no--
the
difference
here
is
whether
or
not,
at
least
as
i
understand
the
difference
between
the
parties,
the
fact
that
the
employer
had
knowledge
independent
of
the
cards
that
was
provided
by
the
picket
line
showing
should
be
enough
to
make
a
difference
in
the
bargaining
obligation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
reinforces
the
card
showing.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
that
has
not
always
been
the
board's
position.
as--
when
we
were
here
before
in
gissel,
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
board's
position
under
the
wagner
act
was
the
joy-silk
position,
and
that
was
also
the
position
during
the
early
days
of
taft-hartley.
joy-silk
position
made
good
faith
doubt
the
touch
stone
at
the
bargaining
obligation.
in
other
words,
the
union
came
forward
with
a
card
showing
or
a
card
showing
plus
a
picket
line
showing.
the
burden
was
on
the
employer,
if
he
rejected
a
bargaining
request,
to
come
forward
with
reasons
to
show
why
he
doubted
the
union's
majority.
the
board,
over
the
years,
had
great
difficulty
in
applying
the
good
faith
doubt
concept
because
it
involved,
in
many
cases,
a
probe
into
the
employer's
objective
motivation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
now,
at
the
time
of
gissel,
we
pointed
out
that
the
board
had
abandoned
the
joy-silk
doctrine
and
had
virtually
ended
up
as
the
court
said
in
gissel.
under
the
board's
current
practice,
an
employer's
good
faith
doubt
is
largely
irrelevant
and
the
key
is
the
commission
of
unserious
unfair
labor
practices.
thus,
an
employer
can
insist
on
an
election
with
no
comment.
the
court
added,
however,
that
the
board
had
a
qualification
that--
of
the
independent
knowledge
that
if
the
employer
knew
through
a
personal
poll,
for
instance,
a
majority
of
his
employees
supported
the
union,
that
would
make
a
different
result.
now,
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
board,
subsequent
to
gissel,
has
concluded
that
the
independent
knowledge
exception
is
subject
to
the
same
problems
in
it
that
led
to
the
abandonment
of
the
good
faith
doubt
principle
to
begin
with
because,
how
are
you
to
know
whether
the
employer
has
an
independent
knowledge?
as
the
board
put
it,
that
would
require
us
to
reenter
the
picket
of
good
faith
doubt
that
we
told
the
court
that
we
had
abandoned
in
gissel.
the
union
says,
however,
a
picket
line
showing
is
something
else.
the
board
concluded
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
board
that
a
picket
line
showing
should
not
be
entitled
to
definitive
weight
because
a
picket
line
showing
is
very
often
the
result
of
a
bandwagon
psychology.
there
may
be
peer
pressures
that
would
induce
it.
and,
to
find
out
whether
the
employees
really
meant
it
or
didn't
mean
it,
you're
going
to
have
to
probe
subjective
motivation
and,
therefore,
the
cleanest
thing
is
to
adopt
the
clear-cut
principle
that
if
an
employer
keeps
his
hands
clean
and
does
not
commit
unfair
labor
practices
which
would
interfere
with
the
holding
of
a
fair
election,
he's
entitled
to
reject
a
showing
less
than
a
board
election.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
there
is
just
one
exception
to
that
and
that
is
the
snow
&
sons
situation
where
the
board
says
that
if
the
employer
waives
his
right
to
an
election
and
agrees
to
be
bound
by
some
other
means
like
a
poll,
he
can't
renege
on
that
and
say
that
“well,
he
still
wants
an
election.”
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
and
that's
the
difference
between
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
goes
with
the
board
in
cutting
loose
from
the
independent
knowledge
vestige
of
the
good--
of
the
joy-silk
history.
but,
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
if
you're
going
to
do
that,
you
got
to
put
something
else
in
is
place.
mr.
norton
j.
come
to
show
good
faith.
mr.
norton
j.
come
by
having
the
employer
file
his
own
petition
or
express
a
willingness
to
consent
to
a
petition
filed
by--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
right,
your
honor,
and
it's
for
that
reason
that
the
board
believes
that
the
court
of
appeals
exceeded
is
reviewing
authority
here
in
mandating
that
the
board
had
to
adopt
that--
well,
they
put
the
board
in
the
horns
of
the
dilemma.
they
either
had
to
go
back
to
the
independent
knowledge
concept
which
the
court
recognized
was
unreliable
and
had
problems,
or
go
to
the
other
extreme
of
requiring
that
the
employer
file
a
petition
if
he
wants
to
get
out
from
under
a
bargaining
obligation.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
there's--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
we
believe
that
the
statute
doesn't
require--
i
mean,
conceivably,
the
board
could
go
to
that
position,
but
we
believe
that
this
is
an
area
that
congress
left
to
the
board
to
determine
what
is
going
to
be
the
proper
accommodation
here.
9
(c)--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
the
reason
is
that
the--
well,
first
of
all,
the--
in
adding
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
to
the
statute
in
1947,
which
is
the
provision
that
gives
the
employer
the
right
to
file
a
petition,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
that
the
employer
would
have
to
file
a
petition
to
resolve
his
doubts.
the
sole
purpose
for
adding
that
provision
was
to
cure
what
was
the
discrimination
that
existed
against
the
employer
under
the
wa--
board's
wagner
act
rules.
under
the
rules
that
the
board
worked
on
in
the
wagner
act,
a
union
could
file
a
petition
but
an
employer
could
only
file
a
petition
if
he
was
presented
by
rival
claims.
and--
so
that,
in
a
one
union
situation
such
as
we
have
here,
he
couldn't
have
filed
one
even
if
he
wanted
to,
and
the
legislative
history
indicated
that
that
was
the
sole
reason
that
the
employer
was
given
the
privilege
of
filing
a
petition.
it
doesn't
say
that
he
has
to
file
one
and
that
if
he
doesn't,
that
he
would
be
subject
to
bargaining
obligation
under
8
(a)
(5).
now--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
do
not
think
that
the
board
would
be
precluded
from
doing
so.
however--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
board
was
reasonable
and--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
was
under
the
joy-silk
rule
but,
having
eliminated
the
joy-silk
rule,
we
submit
that
it
is
reasonable
for
the
board
to
go
the
whole
haul
and
say
that
“we're
not
going
to
get
into
the
question
of
good
faith
or
lack
of
good
faith,
and
the
filing
of
the
petition
does
bear
on
good
faith.
i
mean,
the
union
is
perfectly
free
to
file
a
petition
if
it
wants
an
election,
no
less
than
the
employer.
if
the
union
were
to
file
a
petition,
the
union
would
have
to
define
the
unit
and
it
would
also
have
to
make
a
30%
showing.
if
the
employ--
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
that
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
that
that
is
so.
it
also
accounts
for
the
timing
of
the
election
and
the
length
of
a
period
of
time
in
which
eh
employer
may
have
a
right
to
exercise.
his
power
under
8
(c)
of
the
statute
indicate
why
he
believes
the
employees
may
not
want
a
union,
which
has
become
a
very
important
element.
it
was
added
to
the
statute
in
1947,
when
congress
amended
section
7
of
the
act
to
give
employees
the
right
to
refrain
from
union
activity
no
less
than
the
right
to
engage
in
union
activity.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
we
still
had
the--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
did
legislate
against
that
background.
however--
mr.
norton
j.
come
joy-silk
was,
i
believe
it
was,
after
taft-hartley.
mr.
norton
j.
come
what's
that?
mr.
norton
j.
come
no.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
under
what
circumstances
is
a
union
ever
compelled?
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that--
mr.
norton
j.
come
they
have
the
right.
there
is
no
compulsion
to
file.
the
only
sense
in
which
there
might
be
compulsion
is
that,
in
1959,
congress
added
8
(b)
(7)
(c)
to
the
statute
which
regulates
picketing
for
recognition,
and
that
says
that
you
can
picket
for
recognition
for
30
days
unless
a
petition
for
an
election
is
filed
within
that
period
of
time,
and
if
the
union
is
picketing
for
recognition,
if
it
wants
to
continue
its
picketing
beyond
30
days,
that
might
furnish
some
compulsion
to
file
a
petition
but
there
isn't
any
other--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now,
the
board--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
sir.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
that
is
so.
they
also
believe
that
if
the
employer
petitions,
he--
it's
going
to
be
faster
because
there's--
it's
much--
there's
much
less
likelihood
of
litigation.
now,
we
submit
that
that
is
not
entirely
valid
because
even
if
the
employer
were
to
petition,
unless
he
were
willing
to
consent
to
a
hearing,
that
would
not
speed
things
up
any
because
an
employer
petition
would
not
preclude
the
employer
from
litigating
unit
questions.
for
example,
in
the
wilder
case,
there
was
a
question
of
whether
the
seven
technicals
were
included
in
the
unit
or
not.
now,
even
if
the
employer
were
forced
to
file
a
petition,
it
is
most
unlikely
that
he
would've
waived
his
right
to
go
to
a
hearing
on
that
question
because
that
could
well
make
a
difference
in
the
union's
majority.
similarly,
in
linden,
there
was
a
question
of
supervisory
assistance
in
the
union's
organizational
drive.
an
employer
petition
would
not
have
cut
out
litigation
of
that
point.
so,
we
submit
that
the
assumption
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
an
employer
petition
would
invariably
speed
things
up
would
not,
we
submit,
preclude
an
employer
who
had
either
a
legitimate
or
either--
or
an
illegitimate
basis
for
seeking
to
litigate
issues
still
continuing
to
litigate.
so,
with
that
in
mind,
the
board
has
concluded
there's
no
warrant
for
distorting
the
scheme
of
the
statute
and
then
requiring
an
employer
petition.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
would
say
that
it,
certainly,
likely
to
be
as
much.
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
least
as
much.
mr.
norton
j.
come
right.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
they've
indicated
it
in
their
statements
that
election
is
a
more
reliable
means
of
ascertaining--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
the
picket
line
has
the
added
problems
since
8
(b)
(7)
has
been
added
to
the
statute
in
1959.
if
that
made
the
difference,
if
cards
alone
were
not
enough
but
a
cards
plus
picket
line
would,
it
would
be
encouraging
picketing
for
recognition
contrary
to
the
policy
of
8
(b)
(7)
which
is
to
restrict
such
picketing,
at
least,
and
to
funnel
these
things
into
the
board's
election
processes.
i
believe
i've
already
trespassed
on
my
brother's
time,
so--
mr.
norton
j.
come
at
page
591
of
the
court's
opinion
in
gissel,
the
court
describes
the
board's
current
practice
as
follows.
when
confronted
by
a
recognition
demand
based
on
the
possession
of
cards
allegedly
signed
by
a
majority
of
his
employees,
an
employer
need
not
grant
recognition
immediately
but
may,
unless
he
has
knowledge
independently
of
the
cards
that
the
union
has
a
majority,
decline
the
union's
request
and
insist
on
an
election
either
by
requesting
the
union
to
file
an
election
petition
or
by
filing
such
a
petition
himself
under
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b).
now,
it
is
that
description
of
the
board's
current
practice
that
the
court
later
on,
in
gissel,
found
to
be
in
accord
with
the
policies
of
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
and,
furthermore,
later
on
in
the
gissel
opinion,
in
meeting
the
employer's
argument
that
he's
between
sila
and
caribdus
(ph)
when
faced
with
a
card
check
because
if
he
accepts
it
and
the
union
doesn't
have
a
majority,
he's
guilty
of
a
violation
under
bernard
oaklin
(inaudible).
but,
if
he
attempts
to
question
to
find
out
whether
it
is
in
fact
a
majority
of
the
employees
supported,
he'd
be
guilty
of
an
8
(a)
(1)
violation.
the
court,
again,
states
that
under
the
board's
current
practice
the
employer
is
not
obligated
to
investigate.
he
can
simply
decline
the
recognition
request.
so
that,
insofar
as
what
the
board's
policy
was
at
the
time
of
gissel,
that
was
it
and
the
board
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
employer
was
not
obligated
to
file
a
petition
under
9
(c)
(1)
but
could
invite
the
union
to
do
so.
now,
secondly--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
it
did
not
reach
independent
knowledge.
however,
the
court
in
gissel
recognized,
we
submit,
that
the
board
could
reject
the
good
faith
doubt
test
and
the
board,
on
reflection
after
gissel,
concluded,
and
we
submit
reasonably
so,
that
the
independent
knowledge
element
would
plunge
the
board
into
the
same
good
faith
doubt
picket
that
it
was
in
under
joy-silk.
now,
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history,
the
board's
position
does
not
ignore
the
fact
that
congress,
in
1947,
decided
not
to
adopt
the
house
proposal
that
would've
made
a
board
certification
the
only
basis
on
which
you
could
predicate
a
bargaining
obligation.
the
one
exce--
one
situation
where
that
is
not
so
is
in
a
case
of
voluntary
recognition.
the
second
exception,
which
is
the
principle
situation
because
that's
where
most
of
the
card-based
bargaining
orders
are
found,
are
in
a
situation
where
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices
have
precluded
the
holding
of
a
fair
election.
if
the
house
amendment
had
been
adopted,
you
couldn't
sustain
a
gissel
bargaining
order.
you
would've
needed
a
certification
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
employer
had
engaged
in
all
kinds
of
unfair
labor
practices
that
would've
precluded
the
holding
of
an
election.
the
third
situation
where
a
car--
a
bargaining
order
can
be
predicated
on
a
showing
less
than
a
board
election
is
in
the
snow
&
sons
situation
where
the
employer
agrees
to
a
means
other
than
a
board
election
and
then
doesn't
like
the
results
and
reneges
on
it.
now,
therefore,
we
are
in--
not
in
an
area
like
curtis
or
insurance
agents
where
congress
had
said
“this
is
as
far
as
you
can
go”
and
the
board
is
going
further,
but
we're
in
the
area
where,
and
the
court
of
appeals
agrees
on
that
point,
where
congress
did
leave
room
for
board
discretion,
namely
what
sort
of--
what
situations
are
you
going
to
permit
a
showing
less
than
a
board
election?
and
the
board,
we
submit,
is
reasonable
in
concluding
that,
short
of
the
three
situations
that
i
have
just
outlined,
an
election
is
the
means
that
is
most
likely
to
effectuate
the
overall
policies
of
the
act.
