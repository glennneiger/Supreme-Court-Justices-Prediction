justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
come,
may
i
ask--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
either
employer,
in
these
circumstances,
had
itsil--
had
itself
a
petition
for
an
election,
they
would've
been
entitled
to
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
come,
i
think
you
took--
as
i
remember,
when
gissel
was
here,
the
board
told
us
that
its
view
now
was
that
the
employer,
even
in
circumstances
like
these,
was
entitled
itself
to
insist
upon
an
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
difference
of
these
situations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
when
the
board
went
to
the
idea
that
if
they
wanted
to
refuse
the
cards
and
insist
on
an
election,
whether
they
file
their
own
petition
or
not,
they
could
do
so
without
committing
an
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
when
this
change
is
now--
you
are
now
presenting
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
really,
it
comes
down
to
the
board's
position
that
he's
entitled,
in
the
absence
of
committing
unfair
labor
practices.
he's
entitled
to
an
election
if
he
wants
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
doesn't
it
come
down
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
mr.
cohen,
this
argument
suggest
that
joy-silk
were
wrongly
decided
by
the
board.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
earlier
argument,
mr.
cohen,
suggests
the
board
couldn't
return
to
good
faith
doubt.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
wasn't
what
i
suggested.
your
earlier
argument
was
that,
after
the
47
amendments,
election
period
in
the
absence
of
unfair
labor
practices,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
where
you
have
to
read
the
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
so,
in
an
instance
where
there
were
no
unfair
labor
practices
the
board,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
i
thought
you
were
suggesting,
could
not
return
to
joy-silk.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
isn't
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
good
faith
test.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gold,
isn't
this
an
argument
beyond--
you
didn't
cross-petition,
did
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
desn't
this
go
beyond
what
the
court
of
appeals
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
supporting
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment,
aren't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
surprised
you
didn't
cross-petition
on
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
gold,
if
the
board
were
to
address
it
and
were
to
say
“nothing's
convincing
except
the
result
of
an
election,”
could
they
do
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
exactly.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
whatever
the
definition
of
convincing
evidence
that
the
board,
as
you
suggest,
may
fashion,
it
can
include
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
got
to
be
some
other
chip
types
of
convincing
evidence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
be
certification.
