really,
mr.
cohen,
all
you
need
to
argue
here
is
that
the
board's
present
position
is
a
perfectly
permissible
one
under
the
existing
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
need--
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
need
to
argue
it's
the
only
required
one.
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
to
say
it's
perfectly
permissible
under
the
statute,
and
your
opponents
have
to
say
“no,
it's
not
even
permissible.”
justice

stewart
their
position
is
required.
justice
potter
stewart
by
file,
you
mean
petition
under--
justice
potter
stewart
under
9

(b).
justice

stewart
so,
y--
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
the
language
from
gissel
could
be
read
as
literally
and
as
strongly
and
as
much
of
a
holding
in
that
case,
as
had
been
suggested,
the
most
it
would
mean
that
the
board
can
insist
that
the
employer
avail
himself
of
9
(c)
(1)
(b).
justice
potter
stewart
not
that
he'd
wait
for
the--
justice
potter
stewart
union
to
petition.
