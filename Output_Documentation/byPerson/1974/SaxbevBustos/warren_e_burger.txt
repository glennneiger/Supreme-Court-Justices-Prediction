chief

somewhere
in

there
seems

chief

well,
if
it

have,
in
that
effect,
is
there
something
in
the
nature
of
acquiescence
here
--
chief

in
the

it
having
been

they

you

you

well,
is
the
length

to
an
administrative
interpretation
of
its

rather
weighty
in
the
legislative
acquiescence
doctrine?
chief

well,
these
figures
that
have
been
mentioned
about
the
numbers

take
into
account
the

chief

well,

bearing

how

where
do
you
find
in

chief

let

spot
the
exact
--
chief

--
place
that
will
find
your
--
chief

warren
e.

alright
--
chief

warren
e.
burger
you
really
--
your
argument,
if
i've
followed
you
and
i
won't
vouch
for
that
at
all,
if
i've
followed
it,
there
are
really
three
categories,
the
daily
commuter,
the
seasonal
fellow
and
then
the
man
who
comes
everyday
on
a
substantially
permanent
basis?
chief

warren
e.

three
different
categories?
chief

warren
e.

and
do
you
think
the
first
two
categories
must
stand

fall
together

the
third
is
outside

this
holding,
is
that
correct?
is
the
third
within
the
court
of

holding?
chief

so
this
third
category
is
outside

outside
of

did
the
court
of

deal
with
it?
chief

very
well,

you.
you've

you
think
you
can
clear

all
up

well,
then
perhaps,
your

confused
us.
chief

and
you
reject
the
idea
of
a
third
category?
chief

warren
e.
burger
you
say
the
third
category
belongs
within
the
first?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
your
view,
he
is
a
daily
commuter,
if
he
comes
over
to
sell
some
merchandise
for
three
days
a
week
in
the
united
states

three
days
a
week
in
