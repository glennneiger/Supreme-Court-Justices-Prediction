justice
william
o.
douglas
these
cases
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
involve
the
construction
of
a
rather
obscure
provision
of
the
immigration
and
nationality
act,
pertains
to
its
application
to
people
who
come
over
from
mexico
or
from
canada
each
day
to
work
and
return
at
night.
and
also
to
those
who
would
come
over
from
mexico
or
canada
to
work
for
a
season,
like
in
a
fruit
harvest
or
wheat
harvest,
and
return
at
the
end
of
the
season.
whether
they
are
non-immigrants
in
which
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
in
which
event
there
have
to
be
a
certificate
of
the
secretary
of
labor
that
they're
not
people
available
here
to
do
that
work.
or
if
they
are
immigrants,
then
they
can
--
having
satisfied
the
other
requirements
of
the
act
can
come
without
that
certificate.
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
ninth
circuit
that
held
that
seasonal
and
daily
commuters
were
covered
by
the
immigration
provision
of
the
act.
and
a
ruling
of
the
court
below
in
this
case
had
held
if
all
daily
commuters
were
covered,
the
seasonal
commuters
were
not
covered
and
therefore
the
seasonal
workers
would
have
to
get
a
certificate
from
the
secretary
of
labor.
we
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
think
that
all
--
both
daily
and
seasonal
commuters
are
immigrants
covered
by
that
provision
of
the
act.
therefore
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
marshall,
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
have
joined.
