so,
it
gets
down
to
whether
he
is
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
when
he
has
a
permanent
residence
abroad?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose,
we'd
all
be
more
comfortable
if
we
had
a
more
specific
newer
statute.
is
there
something
pending
in
the
congress
to
clarify
this
general
area?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
the
service
sponsoring
anything
over
there
--
there
are
no
clarifications?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
evans,
as
a
practical
matter,
how
does
the
service
stay
on
top
of
this
continuing
employment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
take
a
seasonal
worker
moving
north
during
the
season,
he
gets
up
to
the
state
of
washington
and
the
apple
crop
for
some
reason
is
late,
so
he
sits
around
for
a
month,
does
he
become
ineligible
because
of
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
at
the
end
of
the
season,
the
seasonal
commuter
when
he
goes
back
to
mexico
is
without
employment,
is
he
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that's
4-years-old
now,
so
it
isn't
so
sudden
as
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it,
but
even
though
this
affidavit
is
4-years-old,
it's
still
the
position
of
state
department?
justice
