mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
proper
treatment
under
the
immigration
laws
of
that
class
of
aliens
known
as
green
card
commuters.
a
commuter
is
an
alien
who
has
been
legally
admitted
to
the
united
states
as
an
immigrant
with
the
attendant
privilege
of
residing
permanently
in
this
country.
he
has
chosen,
however,
not
to
exercise
that
privilege,
at
least
for
the
time
being.
instead,
he
maintains
his
residence
in
mexico
or
canada.
he
commutes
to
work
in
this
country,
entering
each
time
on
the
basis
of
what
used
to
be
a
green
colored
border
crossers'
identification
card,
which
like
the
bluebook
that
some
of
us
know
of
has
changed
colors
but
not
names.
it's
now
blue
card,
it
looks
very
much
like
a
driver's
license,
but
it's
still
called
the
green
card.
this
is
the
immigrant's
alien
registration
receipt
card
which
is
issued
to
every
immigrant
shortly
after
he
enters
this
country.
there
are
two
general
classes
of
commuters,
although
the
lines
are
not
always
easy
to
draw.
first,
some
immigrants
commute
on
a
daily
basis
to
jobs
in
this
country,
returning
each
night
to
their
home,
much
in
the
same
way
that
a
maryland
of
virginia
resident
would
commute
to
the
district
of
columbia.
second,
some
commute
on
a
seasonal
basis
coming
to
this
country
for
longer
stretches
of
time,
usually
to
work
in
agricultural
labor
and
then
returning
to
their
homes
across
the
border
usually
at
the
end
of
the
planting
or
growing
season.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
usually,
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
they
usually
will
follow
the
crops.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
according
to
the
current
statistics
that
have
been
provided
to
me
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
there
are
a
total
of
approximately
50,000
daily
commuters
of
whom
42,000
are
mexican
aliens
and
8,000
are
canadians.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
is
canada
a
significant
factor,
indeed,
it
is,
sir
because
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
are
8,000
daily
commuters
from
canada.
there
are
no
seasonal
commuters
from
canada,
but
insofar
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right,
mostly,
it's
--
the
majority,
i
believe,
are
in
the
windsor-detroit
area,
but
there
are
spread
out
over
the
northwest
and
northeast
as
well,
some
daily
commuters.
of
the
42,000
mexican
daily
commuters,
about
15,000
or
little
less
than
one-third
are
employed
as
farm
laborers,
the
rest
are
engaged
in
industrial
labor
or
building
a
construction
work
or
in
sales
and
service
work.
of
the
8,000
canadians,
less
than
200
are
agricultural
workers.
most,
as
i've
indicated,
commute
from
the
windsor,
ontario
area
to
the
detroit,
michigan
area.
in
addition
to
these
50,000
daily
commuters,
there
are
about
9,000
seasonal
workers.
all
of
them
currently
are
from
mexico,
most
of
them
involved
in
agricultural
work.
the
legal
issue
here
is
whether
these
daily
and
seasonal
commuters,
each
of
whom
has
been
previously
admitted
to
this
country
lawfully
as
an
immigrant,
may
cross
the
border
to
work
each
day
or
each
season
without
applying
each
time
for
a
new
immigrant
visa,
which
is
the
formal
document
ordinarily
required
for
entry
to
this
country
as
an
immigrant.
if
a
new
visa
were
required
for
each
entry,
the
commuter
practice
could
not
continue,
even
if
it
were
physically
possible
to
process
50,000
applications
for
visas
--
for
visas
per
day.
the
entire
annual
limitation
upon
the
issuance
of
immigrant
visas
to
western
hemisphere
immigrants
since
1968
is
120,000
which,
of
course,
would
be
exhausted
in
less
than
three
days.
the
immigration
authorities
have
followed
the
practice
for
47
years
of
permitting
commuters
to
enter
as
immigrants
with
informal
border
crossing
documents
after
their
initial
entry
with
an
immigrant
visa.
the
lawfulness
of
that
practice
under
the
present
act
is
determined
by
section
211
of
the
act,
which
is
set
forth
at
page
80
of
our
brief
and
i
--
it
maybe
worth
referring
to
it
because
the
language
--
the
case
would
--
turns
on
the
precise
language
of
these
sections.

part
a
of

establishes
the
general
rule
that
an

page
80,
i
feel
bad
about
that
after
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
but
this
is
the
appendix.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
so,
in
section
[voice
overlap]
[attempt
to
laughter]
section
211
(a)
establishes
the
general
rule
that
an
immigrant
visa
is
required
for
entry
as
an
immigrant.
211
(b)
establishes
the
sole
exception
to
that
requirement,
which
permits
the
attorney
general
to
dispense
with
formal
documents
for
“returning
resident
immigrants”
defined
in
section
101
(a)
27
(b).
it
is
therefore
the
language
of
that
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
upon
which
this
case
in
our
view
turns.
that
language
appears
just
above
section
211
at
the
top
of
page
80.
it
is
one
of
the
definitions
as
you
can
see
of
special
immigrant.
when
it
is
read
together
with
section
211
(b),
it
provides
that
a
visa
is
not
required
for
entry
by
“an
immigrant
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
who
is
returning
from
a
temporary
visit
abroad.”
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
one
of
the
issues.
there
are
actually
two
others
because
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
also
argue
that
he's
not
an
immigrant
and
that
he
is
not
returning
from
a
temporary
visit
abroad,
but
this
basically
comes
down
to
whether
actual
residence
is
implied
in
this
definition
of
a
person
who
can
enter
on
an
informal
documentation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
are
--
there
are
a
handful,
six
or
so
bills
pending
which
would
have
some
impact
in
one
fashion
or
another
upon
the
commuter
practice.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
have
not
been
any
reports
by
the
relevant
committees
that
have
been
submitted
as
of
yet.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no.
but
i'm
not
sure
if
clarification
is
needed
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
phrase
defined
in
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
that
we
just
looked
at
and
the
crucial
phrase
upon
which
you
--
to
which
you
pointed
is
itself
a
term
of
art
which
is
defined
in
section
(a)
20,
which
is
on
the
prior
page,
at
the
bottom
of
the
prior
page
and
on
top
of
the
next
and
that
says
precisely
what
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
resident
means.
it
means,
the
status
of
having
been
lawfully
accorded
the
privilege
of
residing
permanently
in
the
united
states
as
an
immigrant,
such
status
not
having
changed,
there
is
not
requirement
in
that
definition
and
there's
no
requirement
anywhere
else
in
the
act
that
that
privilege
be
exercised
in
order
to
maintain
the
status
of
a
lawfully
admitted
permanent
resident
or
indeed
to
become
--
to
have
--
to
acquire
the
privileges
that
go
with
being
a
lawfully
admitted
--
a
person
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
that
doesn't
take
care
of
it.
i
think,
it
certainly
bears
on
it
because
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
i
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
no
question
that
at
first
blush,
it
appears
to
what
we
refer
to
someone
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
who's
permanently
residing
here,
who
has
been
out
of
the
country
temporarily
is
returning
to
his
home.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
that's
what
it
would
seem.
but
when
you
analyze
it,
you've
got
three
words,
temporary,
visit
and
abroad.
now
temporary
clearly
applies
in
all
--
in
both
commuters
--
a
commuter
whether
he
is
residing
here
in
mexico
or
in
canada.
abroad
is
also
without
question.
the
only
word
that
really
carries
this
superficial
implication
is
visit,
and
in
the
context
of
a
commuter
who
is
not
a
resident
here,
there's
nothing
that
really
strains
the
language
to
say
that
he's
visiting
when
he
goes
home
to
sleep
or
goes
home
for
part
of
the
season.
what's
implied
in
the
word
visit,
i
think,
is
the
intention
to
come
back
to
this
country,
that
it's
a
departure
for
temporary
purposes
with
an
intention
to
return.
and
i
think
that
that
--
while
it's
--
as
the
ninth
circuit
said,
there's
some
strain
in
the
language,
i
don't
think
it's
so
severe
that
we
should
read
the
rest
of
the
statute
as
having
been
attended
to,
to
abolish
this
practice
we're
going
after
so
long.
let
me
add
also
that
there
is
--
i
mean,
this
all
seems
a
little
strange,
i
confess,
but
the
legislative
history
that
underlies
the
act
itself
makes
it
quite
plain
that
congress
was
fully
aware
that
the
service
was
treating,
had
a
class
of
commuters
that
were
treated
as
lawfully
admitted
permanent
residents,
although
they
were
residing
in
foreign
contiguous
territory
and
on
pages
52-54
of
our
brief,
we've
set
forth
the
crucial
language
in
the
report.
the
report
that
i'm
referring
to
is
one
that
was
a
product
of
an
exhaustive
study
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
1952
act
was
developed
and
ultimately
enacted.
this
was
a
900-page
report
in
which
the
entire
field
of
immigration
and
nationality
law
and
practice
was
thoroughly
examined.
practices
that
were
inconsistent
with
what
the
community
thought
was
good
policy
were
plainly
and
obviously
branded
as
improper
or
that
they
shouldn't
be
continued.
the
committee
regularly
made
recommendations
throughout
the
report
for
legislation
to
correct
what
they
thought
was
an
improper
practice.
it
clearly
and
plainly
recognizes
the
commuter
practice.
it
starts
of
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
is
a
1950
report
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
1950,
but
it
was
--
on
the
basis
of
that
report,
the
initial
bill
which
ultimately
became
a
section
later,
the
1952
act
was
--
and
the
provisions
are
basically
the
same.
i
mean,
it's
an
important
part
of
legislative
history.
no
mention
after
this
report
was
made
of
commuters
in
any
of
the
subsequent
reports.
at
the
top
of
page
53,
we
have
italicized
the
phrase,
a
resident
alien's
border
crossing
identification
card
as
the
resident
alien's
border
crossing
identification
card
is
issued
to
an
alien,
so-called
commuter
who
has
been
admitted
for
lawful
permanent
residence,
but
who
resides
in
foreign
contiguous
territory
and
is
employed
in
the
untied
states.
down
further
again,
the
same
point
is
made.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
don't
think
this
doesn't
address
itself
obviously
to
the
temporary
visit
abroad,
but
i
think
it
recognizes
that
this
practice
has
been
in
existence
that
it's
not
necessarily
inconsistent
with
the
language
that
was
ultimately
adopted
by
the
congress
in
1952
act.
and
i
think
it's
only
proper
to
read
the
temporary
visit
abroad
consistent
with
congress'
awareness
of
this
practice
going
on
and
it's
refusal
to
abolish
it
or
even
to
suggest
anywhere
in
this
900-page
report
that
the
practice
was
improper.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
211
(b)?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
original
language
of
211
(b)
was
enacted
in
1952,
but
it
has
been
amended
and
the
plaintiffs
in
1965
and
the
plaintiffs
--
i
refer
to
mr.
terris'
clients
--
plaintiffs
because
we're
cross-petitioners
here.
the
plaintiffs
attach
some
significance
to
the
change.
originally,
the
language
read,
i'm
looking
now
at
211
(b)
where
the
language
appears,
“returning
resident
immigrants
defined
in
section
101
(a)
27
(b).”
originally
the
language
read,
“aliens
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
who
depart
from
the
united
states
temporarily”
and
the
plaintiffs
have
argued
that
the
changes
from
that
language
to
the
present
language
reflected
congress'
determination
that
actual
residence
was
required.
in
fact,
no
such
purpose
can
be
found
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
amendment.
the
plaintiffs
argue
that
a
brief
exchange,
obscure
colloquy
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
referred
to
it
as,
between
the
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
service
and
a
staff
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee,
in
which
the
staff
member
was
asking
certain
questions
about
the
commuter
practice
and
was
getting
responses
from
the
general
counsel.
they
draw
from
this
the
inference
that
two
years
later
in
a
bill,
it
wasn't
even
before
congress
at
the
time
the
hearings
in
which
this
exchange
took
place,
were
commenced,
was
intended
to
be
a
response
to
the
service's,
practice
with
respect
to
commuters.
well,
it's
very
hard
to
accept
that
when
you
look
at
the
reports
that
are
associated
with
this
1965
amendment
which
was
a
very
major
piece
of
legislation.
nowhere
in
the
report
is
there
any
mention
of
commuters,
the
reports
of
the
house
and
the
senate
each
list
9
or
12
what
they
call
basic
changes
that
are
going
to
be
made
in
the
immigration
act
by
this
amendment.
no
mention
is
made
there
of
commuters.
the
house
or
senate
report
of
(inaudible)
rich
says
that
the
rest
are
minor
and
technical
and
it's
difficult
for
me
to
comprehend
that
the
relevant
committees
of
the
house
and
senate
would
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen
abolish
a
commuter
practice
that's
been
going
on
for
47
years,
at
that
time
not
quite
that
long,
but
for
quite
a
long
time,
without
mentioning
that
it
was
doing
it
or
without
specifying
that
it
had
any
intention
to
do
so.
and
i
can't
believe
that
it
would
be
viewed
as
a
minor
or
technical
change.
there's
a
contention
made
here
also
that
the
commuters
failed
to
satisfy
the
definition
because
they
are
not
immigrants,
but
rather
non-immigrants.
an
immigrant
is
defined
by
the
act
as
any
alien
who
is
not
a
non-immigrant
and
it
is
in
that
sense
a
negative
definition.
if
you're
not
a
non-immigrant,
you're
automatically
an
immigrant.
the
non-immigrants
are
defined
in
--
for
purposes
irrelevant
to
this
case
in
section
101
(a)
15
(h)
(ii)
which
is
set
forth
on
page
79
of
the
brief.
and
that
states
that
you
are
a
non-immigrant,
if
you're
an
alien
having
a
residence
in
a
foreign
country
which
--
who
has
no
intention
of
abandoning
it,
who
is
coming
temporarily
to
the
united
states
to
perform
temporary
services
or
labor.
plaintiffs
contend
that
this
fits
precisely
what
--
to
the
situation
with
respect
to
commuters.
what
they
neglect,
what
they
overlook,
however,
is
that
there
is
an
additional
requirement
associated
with
that
category
of
non-immigrants.
namely,
if
unemployed
persons
capable
of
performing
such
a
service
or
labor
cannot
be
found
in
this
country.
well,
this
is
part
of
the
definition.
if
you
can't
satisfy
that
definition
by
virtue
of
the
act's
language
at
the
top
of
the
page
here,
you
are
an
immigrant,
and
the
act,
in
fact,
in
another
section,
in
section
214,
presumes
that
you
are
an
immigrant
unless
you
establish
that
you
are
a
non-immigrant.
the
plaintiffs
argue
that
this
means,
this
failure
--
they
don't
contend,
let
me
start
there
that
there
are
people
in
this
country
who
cannot
be
found
to
perform
the
labor
that
the
commuters
perform.
they
claim
that
the
availability
of
this
labor
simply
means
that
these
non-immigrants
can't
enter,
they
fall
into
another
land.
they're
neither
non-immigrants
nor
they
are
the
immigrants,
because
if
they
were
non-immigrants,
they
could
come
in
with
non-immigrant
visas
unless
they
were
otherwise
excluded.
they
read
this
as
an
exclusion
when
it
appears
in
a
definitional
section,
it's
part
of
the
definition,
and
the
whole
structure
of
the
act
is
designed
to
make
it
difficult
unless
you
comply
specifically
with
the
language
of
the
definitional
statutes
to
enter
as
non-immigrants,
non-immigrants
who
can
enter
without
regard
to
numerical
limitations.
and
for
that
reason,
most
often,
aliens
seek
to
enter
as
non-immigrants
because
it's
difficult
to
obtain
immigrant
visas.
and
for
that
reason,
the
act
starts
with
a
presumption
that
you're
an
immigrant,
that
you
can't
satisfy
the
non-immigrant
definition,
you're
an
immigrant
and
sometimes
that
means
you
can't
come
in
at
all.
well,
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
have
argued
that
this
is
an
exclusionary
provision.
it's
not
at
all
and
it
wasn't
intended
to
be.
the
act
very
clearly
--
excuse
me,
the
legislative
history
to
which
i
referred
before,
very
clearly
distinguished
between
commuters
on
the
one
hand
whom
they
recognized
the
service
was
treating
as
resident
aliens
and
what
they
called
temporarily
agricultural
labor
on
the
other
hand.
that
referred
to
the
labor
that
had
been
brought
in
under
a
series
of
special
legislation
--
legislative
provisions
to
relieve
manpower
shortages
during
critical
times
for
harvesting
and
so
forth
and
a
determination
was
made
that
there
should
be
some
permanent
provision
in
legislation
to
permit
this
kind
of
relief
of
manpower
shortages.
but
there
was
no
suggestion
that
commuters
were
to
be
put
into
that
category
because
the
committee
that
was
examining
the
immigration
practice
realized
that
commuters
were
not
--
were
part
of
the
stable
labor
pool.
they
were
here
and
they
came
in
regularly
and
they
were
treated
under
the
prior
act
as
having
been
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
it
was
to
expand
the
existing
labor
pool
that
they
made
this
provision
of
section
--
subsection
(h)
(ii),
and
it
was
not
in
any
way
and
effort
to
exclude
aliens
--
to
exclude
commuters.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
there's
nothing
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
suggests
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
think
the
service
at
that
time
had
any
clear
notion
of
their
being
a
distinction.
it's
not
clear
from
the
record
the
service's
kept
because
in
those
days,
there
were
not
--
there
was
no
distinction
made
that
there
were
any
seasonal
--
they
may
have
been
or
may
not
have
been.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
practice
or
in
the
history
to
suggest
that
seasonal
commuters
would
have
been
treated
any
differently
than
daily
commuters.
daily
commuters
--
as
i
said
the
lines
are
difficult
to
draw.
some
seasonal
commuters
stay
in
the
country
for
some
seasons
and
go
back
home
and
commute
daily
for
a
while,
and
it's
a
kind
of
a
spectrum
and
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
again,
there's
a
spectrum
involved.
some
commuters
only
make,
say,
an
average
of
two
entries
and
exits
in
the
course
of
a
calendar
year.
they'll
be
a
planting
season
and
a
harvesting
season,
for
example,
and
in
the
interim,
they
will
be
back
on
their
farm
in
mexico.
others
may
stay
for
a
shorter
period,
a
week
at
a
time
maybe
and
back
for
a
week.
but
there
is
no
set
--
i
can't
give
you
a
typical
example.
there
are
occasions
that
i've
seen
in
reading
through
the
materials
that
have
been
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it's
--
right.
it's
their
--
the
regularity
of
their
entry.
if
under
the
immigration
service's
practice,
if
a
commuter
is
out
of
employment
in
this
country
for
a
period
of
six
months
or
more,
he
is
--
he
loses
his
commuter
status.
his
status
is
changed,
in
other
words,
he
loses
his
status
as
a
lawfully
--
as
a
person
--
alien
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
that's
not
a
statutory
--
that's
a
matter
of
practice,
a
matter
--
the
theory
has
been
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
such
status
having
been
changed.
this
part
is
where
--
that's
where
it
comes
from
within
the
statute.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
eligible
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
he
has
the
privilege
of
establishing
a
permanent
residence
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
in
this
country.
the
immigration
service
through
its
board
of
immigration
appeals
early
on
concluded
that
the
touchstone
of
a
commuter's
privilege
is
his
employment
in
this
country.
that's
what
--
that's
--
that
may
even
be
the
language
they
used.
and
therefore,
if
that
touchstone
disappears,
their
status
disappears.
it
has
grown
up
as
the
practice
within
the
service
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
courts
have
ever
considered
or
not,
but
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
way
it's
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yeah,
but
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
eligible
to
reside
permanently
in
the
untied
states.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
but
that
--
that
eligibility
is
not
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
not
permanent.
that
eligibility
is
not
permanent
even
for
those
who
reside
in
this
country
permanently.
those
who
come
as
immigrants
and
reside
for
ten
years
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
and
leave
for
five
years
as
aliens,
lose
their
status
and
their
ability
to
come
back
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
with
an
informal
document.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe,
it's
implemented
by
the
regulations.
the
regulations
are
an
8
cfr
211
(b)
and
they
specify
what
you
have
to
do
if
you
are
a
resident
alien
who
needs
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
if
you're
leaving
for
a
period
of
more
than
a
year,
you
are
--
i
guess,
it's
up
to
a
year,
you
have
to
obtain
a
reentry
permit,
at
least
that's
what
the
regulation
says.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
reentry
permit,
if
you
are
leaving
for
that
shorter
time
is
the
green
card,
but
211
(b)
by
the
way
is
set
forth
in
the
back
of
our
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
but
this
is
the
administrative
interpretation
implementation
of
the
phrase
in
the
statute,
“such
status
not
having
changed.”
if
a
resident
alien
is
out
of
the
country
for
longer
than
the
period
established
by
these
regulations,
he
loses
his
privilege
of
returning
to
the
country
on
the
basis
of
informal
documentations,
i.e.,
a
reentry
permit
or
a
green
card
as
opposed
to
a
new
immigrant
visa.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
satisfied
my
curiosity
about
that
myself
and
apparently,
the
commuters
are
identified
by
certain
markings
on
the
green
card
and
to
the
green
card
is
attached
a
form
upon
which
information
is
listed
concerning
the
last
entry
and
concerning
--
well,
i
gather
that
what
is
done
is
that
the
--
there
are
indications
in
code
made
on
these
attachments
that
indicate
when
it
was
he
was
last
exhibited
evidence
of
employment.
and
when
the
appropriate
period
of
time
is
expired,
they
warned
him
that
the
next
entry
will
require
new
evidence
of
employment
and
if
he
fails
to
present
that
evidence
the
next
time,
he
is
not
permitted
to
enter.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it's
only
an
absence
from
the
country
without
employment,
that's
the
key
to
ineligibility.
he
could
stay
in
the
country
forever
for
his
life
at
that
point.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
when
he
goes
back
to
mexico?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
but
he's
--
if
he's
out
of
employment
for
longer
than
six
months,
he
cannot
reenter
as
a
commuter.
he
must
--
if
he
enters
at
all,
enter
with
a
new
immigrant
visa.
it's
the
only
those
seasonal
commuters
whose
absence
from
this
country
is
less
than
--
for
less
than
six
months
at
a
time.
that
is
as
i
indicate
there
maybe
two
seasons,
a
planting
season
and
the
harvesting
season.
they
maybe
here
for
several
months
at
each
occasion,
but
they
may
--
they
will
fall
at
periods
for
less
than
six
months
between
entries.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
the
record
contains
an
affidavit
by
the
secretary
of
state
rogers,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
of
the
petition
at
page
38-40.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
was
sworn
to
on
the
21st
of
april,
1970.
we
indicate
in
our
brief
that
we
have
consulted
with
the
state
department
in
the
time
we
prepared
the
brief
and
we're
told
that
if
the
matter
became
important
at
some
point
that
they
would
consider
submitting
a
fresh
affidavit.
the
same
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
same
what?
is
that
--
reaching
the
same
conclusions?
the
same
conclusions
and
the
same
concerns
of
state
department
have
been
expressed
for
many,
many
years
whenever
the
issue
has
come
up.
as
long
ago,
i
remember
in
the
--
at
some
point
in
legislative
history
of
some
section,
an
affidavit
or
a
letter
from
secretary
of
state,
cordell
hull.
in
the
earlier
litigation
of
the
ninth
circuit,
there
was
an
affidavit
there
too.
there
was
also
an
affidavit
i
believe
in
1964
when
a
case
was
brought
challenging
the
same
practice
but
was
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
standing.
there
too,
an
affidavit
was
submitted,
i
believe,
by
secretary
of
state,
ross.
so
it's
not
--
it's
not
something
that
is
varied,
it's
something
that
has
been
consistent.
it's
not
necessarily
in
other
opposing
opposition
to
any
change
in
the
practice.
what
it
is,
is
a
strong
feeling
that
a
sudden,
as
this
affidavit
states,
a
sudden
judicial
termination
of
the
practice
which
would
affect
existing
commuters,
could
have
a
severe
impact
in
our
relations
with
our
neighbors.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
isn't
so
sudden,
but
it
would
be
sudden
in
the
sense
that
there'd
be
no
phase-out
period,
which
is
one
of
the
proposals
that
is
before
congress.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
our
information,
yes,
as
of
the
time
that
the
brief
was
prepared.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe
that
the
--
there's
no
stay
that
i
know
of,
but
i
believe
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
i
don't
--
the
opinion
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
remanded
the
case
to
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
its
opinion.
so
far
as
i
know,
no
further
proceedings
were
instituted
because
of
the
pendency
of
this
case
in
this
court.
so,
there's
been
no
final
judgment
entered
directing
the
service
to
pick
up
the
green
cards
for
seasonal
commuters.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
even
without
to
stay.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe,
the
mandate
has,
but
if
you
know,
i
believe
that
it's
not
improper
for
a
district
judge
in
these
circumstances
to
wait
until
the
litigation
has
come
to
its
final
conclusion
when
there's
litigations
pending
in
this
court.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
surely.
i
thought
i've
done
that
originally.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
is
--
addressing
this
last
issue
first,
no
legal
difference
between
any
of
these
categories,
call
them
three
or
call
them
two.
i
understand
there
to
be
two.
a
daily
commuter
is
someone
who
comes
to
this
country
regularly
on
a
day-by-day
basis.
as
i
say
the
lines
are
frequently
hard
to
draw.
sometimes
they
come
twice
a
week
or
three
times
a
week
rather
than
daily,
but
they
are
regular
commuters.
some
of
them
come
to
permanent
job.
some
of
them
come
to
look
for
employment
everyday
or
to
look
for
a
temporary
employment.
it
matters
not,
because
the
only
reason
that
would
make
any
difference
is
if
you
agree
with
the
plaintiffs'
contention
here
that
these
people
must
be
treated
as
non-immigrants
if
they're
coming
to
perform
temporary
service.
it
just
doesn't
work.
the
definition
includes
what
mr.
terris
would
like
to
read
as
an
exclusion.
it
is
part
of
the
definition
that
if
there
are
people
available
to
perform
this
labor,
these
people
are
not
non-immigrants,
they're
immigrants,
and
the
only
way
they
can
come
into
this
country
is
either
with
an
immigrant
visa
or
with
an
informal
documentation
like
a
green
card.
so
there
are
two
classes
as
i
see
it.
i
think,
they
are
indistinguishable.
the
government's
position
as
i
understood
mr.
terris
is
to
be
is
that
they
stand
or
fall
together.
the
only
conceivable
distinction
aside
from
the
notion
that
one
class
is
non-immigrants
and
the
other
isn't
is
that
one
practice
has
lasted
longer.
but
the
practice
has
not
--
that
seasonal
commuter
practice
grew
up
really
at
a
time
after
a
series
of
temporary
measures
for
bringing
a
temporary
labor
into
the
country
had
expired
and
it
was
--
it's
not
a
new
legal
theory,
it
was
just
a
new
category
of
workers
who
took
advantage
of
what
was
already
there
for
their
benefit
already.
and
i
should
address
briefly
also
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
if
they
are
correct
on
one,
i
think,
they
are
wrong
on
the
other.
i
think,
the
decision
cannot
be
reconciled
of
the
two.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
the
daily
commuter,
whether
he
has
permanent
job
here
or
whether
he
comes
everyday
looking
for
job.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
suppose
if,
you
know,
now
that
the
problem
has
been
explored
through
litigation
that
the
regulations
about
which
we
have
some
reason
to
be
embarrassed
might
well
be
amended
and
the
service
would
like
to
amend
those
regulations
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
might
say
that
it
was
at
one
point
considered
whether
the
regulations
should
be
amended
to
correct
the
ambiguity,
but
it
was
determined,
i
think,
quite
rightly
that
it
would
be
improper
to
make
such
an
amendment,
while
the
case
is
in
litigation,
and
there
has
been
litigation
over
this
issue
ever
since
1966
when
the
case
was
instituted
in
the
ninth
circuit,
gooch
against
clark.
there's
never
been
a
time
when
we've
had
a
chance
to
make
any
amendments
without
interfering
with
ongoing
litigation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
concerns
the
proper
treatment
under
the
immigration
laws
of
that
class
of
aliens
known
as
green
card
commuters.
a
commuter
is
an
alien
who
has
been
legally
admitted
to
the
united
states
as
an
immigrant
with
the
attendant
privilege
of
residing
permanently
in
this
country.
he
has
chosen,
however,
not
to
exercise
that
privilege,
at
least
for
the
time
being.
instead,
he
maintains
his
residence
in
mexico
or
canada.
he
commutes
to
work
in
this
country,
entering
each
time
on
the
basis
of
what
used
to
be
a
green
colored
border
crossers'
identification
card,
which
like
the
bluebook
that
some
of
us
know
of
has
changed
colors
but
not
names.
it's
now
blue
card,
it
looks
very
much
like
a
driver's
license,
but
it's
still
called
the
green
card.
this
is
the
immigrant's
alien
registration
receipt
card
which
is
issued
to
every
immigrant
shortly
after
he
enters
this
country.
there
are
two
general
classes
of
commuters,
although
the
lines
are
not
always
easy
to
draw.
first,
some
immigrants
commute
on
a
daily
basis
to
jobs
in
this
country,
returning
each
night
to
their
home,
much
in
the
same
way
that
a
maryland
of
virginia
resident
would
commute
to
the
district
of
columbia.
second,
some
commute
on
a
seasonal
basis
coming
to
this
country
for
longer
stretches
of
time,
usually
to
work
in
agricultural
labor
and
then
returning
to
their
homes
across
the
border
usually
at
the
end
of
the
planting
or
growing
season.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
usually,
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
they
usually
will
follow
the
crops.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
according
to
the
current
statistics
that
have
been
provided
to
me
by
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service,
there
are
a
total
of
approximately
50,000
daily
commuters
of
whom
42,000
are
mexican
aliens
and
8,000
are
canadians.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
is
canada
a
significant
factor,
indeed,
it
is,
sir
because
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
are
8,000
daily
commuters
from
canada.
there
are
no
seasonal
commuters
from
canada,
but
insofar
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right,
mostly,
it's
--
the
majority,
i
believe,
are
in
the
windsor-detroit
area,
but
there
are
spread
out
over
the
northwest
and
northeast
as
well,
some
daily
commuters.
of
the
42,000
mexican
daily
commuters,
about
15,000
or
little
less
than
one-third
are
employed
as
farm
laborers,
the
rest
are
engaged
in
industrial
labor
or
building
a
construction
work
or
in
sales
and
service
work.
of
the
8,000
canadians,
less
than
200
are
agricultural
workers.
most,
as
i've
indicated,
commute
from
the
windsor,
ontario
area
to
the
detroit,
michigan
area.
in
addition
to
these
50,000
daily
commuters,
there
are
about
9,000
seasonal
workers.
all
of
them
currently
are
from
mexico,
most
of
them
involved
in
agricultural
work.
the
legal
issue
here
is
whether
these
daily
and
seasonal
commuters,
each
of
whom
has
been
previously
admitted
to
this
country
lawfully
as
an
immigrant,
may
cross
the
border
to
work
each
day
or
each
season
without
applying
each
time
for
a
new
immigrant
visa,
which
is
the
formal
document
ordinarily
required
for
entry
to
this
country
as
an
immigrant.
if
a
new
visa
were
required
for
each
entry,
the
commuter
practice
could
not
continue,
even
if
it
were
physically
possible
to
process
50,000
applications
for
visas
--
for
visas
per
day.
the
entire
annual
limitation
upon
the
issuance
of
immigrant
visas
to
western
hemisphere
immigrants
since
1968
is
120,000
which,
of
course,
would
be
exhausted
in
less
than
three
days.
the
immigration
authorities
have
followed
the
practice
for
47
years
of
permitting
commuters
to
enter
as
immigrants
with
informal
border
crossing
documents
after
their
initial
entry
with
an
immigrant
visa.
the
lawfulness
of
that
practice
under
the
present
act
is
determined
by
section
211
of
the
act,
which
is
set
forth
at
page
80
of
our
brief
and
i
--
it
maybe
worth
referring
to
it
because
the
language
--
the
case
would
--
turns
on
the
precise
language
of
these
sections.

i
feel
bad
about
that
after

the
appendix.
mr.
mark
l.

so,
in
section
[voice

[attempt

section
211
(a)
establishes
the
general
rule
that
an
immigrant
visa
is
required
for
entry
as
an
immigrant.
211
(b)
establishes
the
sole
exception
to
that
requirement,
which
permits
the
attorney
general
to
dispense
with
formal
documents
for
“returning
resident
immigrants”
defined
in
section
101
(a)
27
(b).
it
is
therefore
the
language
of
that
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
upon
which
this
case
in
our
view
turns.
that
language
appears
just
above
section
211
at
the
top
of
page
80.
it
is
one
of
the
definitions
as
you
can
see
of
special
immigrant.
when
it
is
read
together
with
section
211
(b),
it
provides
that
a
visa
is
not
required
for
entry
by
“an
immigrant
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
who
is
returning
from
a
temporary
visit
abroad.”
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
one
of
the
issues.
there
are
actually
two
others
because
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
also
argue
that
he's
not
an
immigrant
and
that
he
is
not
returning
from
a
temporary
visit
abroad,
but
this
basically
comes
down
to
whether
actual
residence
is
implied
in
this
definition
of
a
person
who
can
enter
on
an
informal
documentation.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
are
--
there
are
a
handful,
six
or
so
bills
pending
which
would
have
some
impact
in
one
fashion
or
another
upon
the
commuter
practice.
so
far
as
i
know,
there
have
not
been
any
reports
by
the
relevant
committees
that
have
been
submitted
as
of
yet.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no.
but
i'm
not
sure
if
clarification
is
needed
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
phrase
defined
in
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
that
we
just
looked
at
and
the
crucial
phrase
upon
which
you
--
to
which
you
pointed
is
itself
a
term
of
art
which
is
defined
in
section
(a)
20,
which
is
on
the
prior
page,
at
the
bottom
of
the
prior
page
and
on
top
of
the
next
and
that
says
precisely
what
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
resident
means.
it
means,
the
status
of
having
been
lawfully
accorded
the
privilege
of
residing
permanently
in
the
united
states
as
an
immigrant,
such
status
not
having
changed,
there
is
not
requirement
in
that
definition
and
there's
no
requirement
anywhere
else
in
the
act
that
that
privilege
be
exercised
in
order
to
maintain
the
status
of
a
lawfully
admitted
permanent
resident
or
indeed
to
become
--
to
have
--
to
acquire
the
privileges
that
go
with
being
a
lawfully
admitted
--
a
person
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
that
doesn't
take
care
of
it.
i
think,
it
certainly
bears
on
it
because
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
i
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
no
question
that
at
first
blush,
it
appears
to
what
we
refer
to
someone
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
who's
permanently
residing
here,
who
has
been
out
of
the
country
temporarily
is
returning
to
his
home.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
that's
what
it
would
seem.
but
when
you
analyze
it,
you've
got
three
words,
temporary,
visit
and
abroad.
now
temporary
clearly
applies
in
all
--
in
both
commuters
--
a
commuter
whether
he
is
residing
here
in
mexico
or
in
canada.
abroad
is
also
without
question.
the
only
word
that
really
carries
this
superficial
implication
is
visit,
and
in
the
context
of
a
commuter
who
is
not
a
resident
here,
there's
nothing
that
really
strains
the
language
to
say
that
he's
visiting
when
he
goes
home
to
sleep
or
goes
home
for
part
of
the
season.
what's
implied
in
the
word
visit,
i
think,
is
the
intention
to
come
back
to
this
country,
that
it's
a
departure
for
temporary
purposes
with
an
intention
to
return.
and
i
think
that
that
--
while
it's
--
as
the
ninth
circuit
said,
there's
some
strain
in
the
language,
i
don't
think
it's
so
severe
that
we
should
read
the
rest
of
the
statute
as
having
been
attended
to,
to
abolish
this
practice
we're
going
after
so
long.
let
me
add
also
that
there
is
--
i
mean,
this
all
seems
a
little
strange,
i
confess,
but
the
legislative
history
that
underlies
the
act
itself
makes
it
quite
plain
that
congress
was
fully
aware
that
the
service
was
treating,
had
a
class
of
commuters
that
were
treated
as
lawfully
admitted
permanent
residents,
although
they
were
residing
in
foreign
contiguous
territory
and
on
pages
52-54
of
our
brief,
we've
set
forth
the
crucial
language
in
the
report.
the
report
that
i'm
referring
to
is
one
that
was
a
product
of
an
exhaustive
study
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
the
1952
act
was
developed
and
ultimately
enacted.
this
was
a
900-page
report
in
which
the
entire
field
of
immigration
and
nationality
law
and
practice
was
thoroughly
examined.
practices
that
were
inconsistent
with
what
the
community
thought
was
good
policy
were
plainly
and
obviously
branded
as
improper
or
that
they
shouldn't
be
continued.
the
committee
regularly
made
recommendations
throughout
the
report
for
legislation
to
correct
what
they
thought
was
an
improper
practice.
it
clearly
and
plainly
recognizes
the
commuter
practice.
it
starts
of
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
is
a
1950
report
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
1950,
but
it
was
--
on
the
basis
of
that
report,
the
initial
bill
which
ultimately
became
a
section
later,
the
1952
act
was
--
and
the
provisions
are
basically
the
same.
i
mean,
it's
an
important
part
of
legislative
history.
no
mention
after
this
report
was
made
of
commuters
in
any
of
the
subsequent
reports.
at
the
top
of
page
53,
we
have
italicized
the
phrase,
a
resident
alien's
border
crossing
identification
card
as
the
resident
alien's
border
crossing
identification
card
is
issued
to
an
alien,
so-called
commuter
who
has
been
admitted
for
lawful
permanent
residence,
but
who
resides
in
foreign
contiguous
territory
and
is
employed
in
the
untied
states.
down
further
again,
the
same
point
is
made.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
don't
think
this
doesn't
address
itself
obviously
to
the
temporary
visit
abroad,
but
i
think
it
recognizes
that
this
practice
has
been
in
existence
that
it's
not
necessarily
inconsistent
with
the
language
that
was
ultimately
adopted
by
the
congress
in
1952
act.
and
i
think
it's
only
proper
to
read
the
temporary
visit
abroad
consistent
with
congress'
awareness
of
this
practice
going
on
and
it's
refusal
to
abolish
it
or
even
to
suggest
anywhere
in
this
900-page
report
that
the
practice
was
improper.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
211
(b)?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
original
language
of
211
(b)
was
enacted
in
1952,
but
it
has
been
amended
and
the
plaintiffs
in
1965
and
the
plaintiffs
--
i
refer
to
mr.
terris'
clients
--
plaintiffs
because
we're
cross-petitioners
here.
the
plaintiffs
attach
some
significance
to
the
change.
originally,
the
language
read,
i'm
looking
now
at
211
(b)
where
the
language
appears,
“returning
resident
immigrants
defined
in
section
101
(a)
27
(b).”
originally
the
language
read,
“aliens
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
who
depart
from
the
united
states
temporarily”
and
the
plaintiffs
have
argued
that
the
changes
from
that
language
to
the
present
language
reflected
congress'
determination
that
actual
residence
was
required.
in
fact,
no
such
purpose
can
be
found
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
amendment.
the
plaintiffs
argue
that
a
brief
exchange,
obscure
colloquy
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
referred
to
it
as,
between
the
general
counsel
of
the
immigration
service
and
a
staff
member
of
the
house
judiciary
committee,
in
which
the
staff
member
was
asking
certain
questions
about
the
commuter
practice
and
was
getting
responses
from
the
general
counsel.
they
draw
from
this
the
inference
that
two
years
later
in
a
bill,
it
wasn't
even
before
congress
at
the
time
the
hearings
in
which
this
exchange
took
place,
were
commenced,
was
intended
to
be
a
response
to
the
service's,
practice
with
respect
to
commuters.
well,
it's
very
hard
to
accept
that
when
you
look
at
the
reports
that
are
associated
with
this
1965
amendment
which
was
a
very
major
piece
of
legislation.
nowhere
in
the
report
is
there
any
mention
of
commuters,
the
reports
of
the
house
and
the
senate
each
list
9
or
12
what
they
call
basic
changes
that
are
going
to
be
made
in
the
immigration
act
by
this
amendment.
no
mention
is
made
there
of
commuters.
the
house
or
senate
report
of
(inaudible)
rich
says
that
the
rest
are
minor
and
technical
and
it's
difficult
for
me
to
comprehend
that
the
relevant
committees
of
the
house
and
senate
would
with
the
stroke
of
a
pen
abolish
a
commuter
practice
that's
been
going
on
for
47
years,
at
that
time
not
quite
that
long,
but
for
quite
a
long
time,
without
mentioning
that
it
was
doing
it
or
without
specifying
that
it
had
any
intention
to
do
so.
and
i
can't
believe
that
it
would
be
viewed
as
a
minor
or
technical
change.
there's
a
contention
made
here
also
that
the
commuters
failed
to
satisfy
the
definition
because
they
are
not
immigrants,
but
rather
non-immigrants.
an
immigrant
is
defined
by
the
act
as
any
alien
who
is
not
a
non-immigrant
and
it
is
in
that
sense
a
negative
definition.
if
you're
not
a
non-immigrant,
you're
automatically
an
immigrant.
the
non-immigrants
are
defined
in
--
for
purposes
irrelevant
to
this
case
in
section
101
(a)
15
(h)
(ii)
which
is
set
forth
on
page
79
of
the
brief.
and
that
states
that
you
are
a
non-immigrant,
if
you're
an
alien
having
a
residence
in
a
foreign
country
which
--
who
has
no
intention
of
abandoning
it,
who
is
coming
temporarily
to
the
united
states
to
perform
temporary
services
or
labor.
plaintiffs
contend
that
this
fits
precisely
what
--
to
the
situation
with
respect
to
commuters.
what
they
neglect,
what
they
overlook,
however,
is
that
there
is
an
additional
requirement
associated
with
that
category
of
non-immigrants.
namely,
if
unemployed
persons
capable
of
performing
such
a
service
or
labor
cannot
be
found
in
this
country.
well,
this
is
part
of
the
definition.
if
you
can't
satisfy
that
definition
by
virtue
of
the
act's
language
at
the
top
of
the
page
here,
you
are
an
immigrant,
and
the
act,
in
fact,
in
another
section,
in
section
214,
presumes
that
you
are
an
immigrant
unless
you
establish
that
you
are
a
non-immigrant.
the
plaintiffs
argue
that
this
means,
this
failure
--
they
don't
contend,
let
me
start
there
that
there
are
people
in
this
country
who
cannot
be
found
to
perform
the
labor
that
the
commuters
perform.
they
claim
that
the
availability
of
this
labor
simply
means
that
these
non-immigrants
can't
enter,
they
fall
into
another
land.
they're
neither
non-immigrants
nor
they
are
the
immigrants,
because
if
they
were
non-immigrants,
they
could
come
in
with
non-immigrant
visas
unless
they
were
otherwise
excluded.
they
read
this
as
an
exclusion
when
it
appears
in
a
definitional
section,
it's
part
of
the
definition,
and
the
whole
structure
of
the
act
is
designed
to
make
it
difficult
unless
you
comply
specifically
with
the
language
of
the
definitional
statutes
to
enter
as
non-immigrants,
non-immigrants
who
can
enter
without
regard
to
numerical
limitations.
and
for
that
reason,
most
often,
aliens
seek
to
enter
as
non-immigrants
because
it's
difficult
to
obtain
immigrant
visas.
and
for
that
reason,
the
act
starts
with
a
presumption
that
you're
an
immigrant,
that
you
can't
satisfy
the
non-immigrant
definition,
you're
an
immigrant
and
sometimes
that
means
you
can't
come
in
at
all.
well,
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
have
argued
that
this
is
an
exclusionary
provision.
it's
not
at
all
and
it
wasn't
intended
to
be.
the
act
very
clearly
--
excuse
me,
the
legislative
history
to
which
i
referred
before,
very
clearly
distinguished
between
commuters
on
the
one
hand
whom
they
recognized
the
service
was
treating
as
resident
aliens
and
what
they
called
temporarily
agricultural
labor
on
the
other
hand.
that
referred
to
the
labor
that
had
been
brought
in
under
a
series
of
special
legislation
--
legislative
provisions
to
relieve
manpower
shortages
during
critical
times
for
harvesting
and
so
forth
and
a
determination
was
made
that
there
should
be
some
permanent
provision
in
legislation
to
permit
this
kind
of
relief
of
manpower
shortages.
but
there
was
no
suggestion
that
commuters
were
to
be
put
into
that
category
because
the
committee
that
was
examining
the
immigration
practice
realized
that
commuters
were
not
--
were
part
of
the
stable
labor
pool.
they
were
here
and
they
came
in
regularly
and
they
were
treated
under
the
prior
act
as
having
been
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
it
was
to
expand
the
existing
labor
pool
that
they
made
this
provision
of
section
--
subsection
(h)
(ii),
and
it
was
not
in
any
way
and
effort
to
exclude
aliens
--
to
exclude
commuters.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
there's
nothing
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
suggests
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don't
think
the
service
at
that
time
had
any
clear
notion
of
their
being
a
distinction.
it's
not
clear
from
the
record
the
service's
kept
because
in
those
days,
there
were
not
--
there
was
no
distinction
made
that
there
were
any
seasonal
--
they
may
have
been
or
may
not
have
been.
but
there's
nothing
in
the
practice
or
in
the
history
to
suggest
that
seasonal
commuters
would
have
been
treated
any
differently
than
daily
commuters.
daily
commuters
--
as
i
said
the
lines
are
difficult
to
draw.
some
seasonal
commuters
stay
in
the
country
for
some
seasons
and
go
back
home
and
commute
daily
for
a
while,
and
it's
a
kind
of
a
spectrum
and
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
again,
there's
a
spectrum
involved.
some
commuters
only
make,
say,
an
average
of
two
entries
and
exits
in
the
course
of
a
calendar
year.
they'll
be
a
planting
season
and
a
harvesting
season,
for
example,
and
in
the
interim,
they
will
be
back
on
their
farm
in
mexico.
others
may
stay
for
a
shorter
period,
a
week
at
a
time
maybe
and
back
for
a
week.
but
there
is
no
set
--
i
can't
give
you
a
typical
example.
there
are
occasions
that
i've
seen
in
reading
through
the
materials
that
have
been
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it's
--
right.
it's
their
--
the
regularity
of
their
entry.
if
under
the
immigration
service's
practice,
if
a
commuter
is
out
of
employment
in
this
country
for
a
period
of
six
months
or
more,
he
is
--
he
loses
his
commuter
status.
his
status
is
changed,
in
other
words,
he
loses
his
status
as
a
lawfully
--
as
a
person
--
alien
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
that's
not
a
statutory
--
that's
a
matter
of
practice,
a
matter
--
the
theory
has
been
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
such
status
having
been
changed.
this
part
is
where
--
that's
where
it
comes
from
within
the
statute.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
eligible
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
he
has
the
privilege
of
establishing
a
permanent
residence
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
in
this
country.
the
immigration
service
through
its
board
of
immigration
appeals
early
on
concluded
that
the
touchstone
of
a
commuter's
privilege
is
his
employment
in
this
country.
that's
what
--
that's
--
that
may
even
be
the
language
they
used.
and
therefore,
if
that
touchstone
disappears,
their
status
disappears.
it
has
grown
up
as
the
practice
within
the
service
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
courts
have
ever
considered
or
not,
but
that
is
the
--
that
is
the
way
it's
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yeah,
but
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
eligible
to
reside
permanently
in
the
untied
states.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
but
that
--
that
eligibility
is
not
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
not
permanent.
that
eligibility
is
not
permanent
even
for
those
who
reside
in
this
country
permanently.
those
who
come
as
immigrants
and
reside
for
ten
years
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
and
leave
for
five
years
as
aliens,
lose
their
status
and
their
ability
to
come
back
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
with
an
informal
document.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe,
it's
implemented
by
the
regulations.
the
regulations
are
an
8
cfr
211
(b)
and
they
specify
what
you
have
to
do
if
you
are
a
resident
alien
who
needs
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
if
you're
leaving
for
a
period
of
more
than
a
year,
you
are
--
i
guess,
it's
up
to
a
year,
you
have
to
obtain
a
reentry
permit,
at
least
that's
what
the
regulation
says.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
reentry
permit,
if
you
are
leaving
for
that
shorter
time
is
the
green
card,
but
211
(b)
by
the
way
is
set
forth
in
the
back
of
our
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
but
this
is
the
administrative
interpretation
implementation
of
the
phrase
in
the
statute,
“such
status
not
having
changed.”
if
a
resident
alien
is
out
of
the
country
for
longer
than
the
period
established
by
these
regulations,
he
loses
his
privilege
of
returning
to
the
country
on
the
basis
of
informal
documentations,
i.e.,
a
reentry
permit
or
a
green
card
as
opposed
to
a
new
immigrant
visa.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
satisfied
my
curiosity
about
that
myself
and
apparently,
the
commuters
are
identified
by
certain
markings
on
the
green
card
and
to
the
green
card
is
attached
a
form
upon
which
information
is
listed
concerning
the
last
entry
and
concerning
--
well,
i
gather
that
what
is
done
is
that
the
--
there
are
indications
in
code
made
on
these
attachments
that
indicate
when
it
was
he
was
last
exhibited
evidence
of
employment.
and
when
the
appropriate
period
of
time
is
expired,
they
warned
him
that
the
next
entry
will
require
new
evidence
of
employment
and
if
he
fails
to
present
that
evidence
the
next
time,
he
is
not
permitted
to
enter.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it's
only
an
absence
from
the
country
without
employment,
that's
the
key
to
ineligibility.
he
could
stay
in
the
country
forever
for
his
life
at
that
point.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
when
he
goes
back
to
mexico?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
but
he's
--
if
he's
out
of
employment
for
longer
than
six
months,
he
cannot
reenter
as
a
commuter.
he
must
--
if
he
enters
at
all,
enter
with
a
new
immigrant
visa.
it's
the
only
those
seasonal
commuters
whose
absence
from
this
country
is
less
than
--
for
less
than
six
months
at
a
time.
that
is
as
i
indicate
there
maybe
two
seasons,
a
planting
season
and
the
harvesting
season.
they
maybe
here
for
several
months
at
each
occasion,
but
they
may
--
they
will
fall
at
periods
for
less
than
six
months
between
entries.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
the
record
contains
an
affidavit
by
the
secretary
of
state
rogers,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
of
the
petition
at
page
38-40.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
was
sworn
to
on
the
21st
of
april,
1970.
we
indicate
in
our
brief
that
we
have
consulted
with
the
state
department
in
the
time
we
prepared
the
brief
and
we're
told
that
if
the
matter
became
important
at
some
point
that
they
would
consider
submitting
a
fresh
affidavit.
the
same
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
same
what?
is
that
--
reaching
the
same
conclusions?
the
same
conclusions
and
the
same
concerns
of
state
department
have
been
expressed
for
many,
many
years
whenever
the
issue
has
come
up.
as
long
ago,
i
remember
in
the
--
at
some
point
in
legislative
history
of
some
section,
an
affidavit
or
a
letter
from
secretary
of
state,
cordell
hull.
in
the
earlier
litigation
of
the
ninth
circuit,
there
was
an
affidavit
there
too.
there
was
also
an
affidavit
i
believe
in
1964
when
a
case
was
brought
challenging
the
same
practice
but
was
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
standing.
there
too,
an
affidavit
was
submitted,
i
believe,
by
secretary
of
state,
ross.
so
it's
not
--
it's
not
something
that
is
varied,
it's
something
that
has
been
consistent.
it's
not
necessarily
in
other
opposing
opposition
to
any
change
in
the
practice.
what
it
is,
is
a
strong
feeling
that
a
sudden,
as
this
affidavit
states,
a
sudden
judicial
termination
of
the
practice
which
would
affect
existing
commuters,
could
have
a
severe
impact
in
our
relations
with
our
neighbors.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
isn't
so
sudden,
but
it
would
be
sudden
in
the
sense
that
there'd
be
no
phase-out
period,
which
is
one
of
the
proposals
that
is
before
congress.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
our
information,
yes,
as
of
the
time
that
the
brief
was
prepared.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe
that
the
--
there's
no
stay
that
i
know
of,
but
i
believe
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
i
don't
--
the
opinion
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
remanded
the
case
to
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
its
opinion.
so
far
as
i
know,
no
further
proceedings
were
instituted
because
of
the
pendency
of
this
case
in
this
court.
so,
there's
been
no
final
judgment
entered
directing
the
service
to
pick
up
the
green
cards
for
seasonal
commuters.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
even
without
to
stay.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
believe,
the
mandate
has,
but
if
you
know,
i
believe
that
it's
not
improper
for
a
district
judge
in
these
circumstances
to
wait
until
the
litigation
has
come
to
its
final
conclusion
when
there's
litigations
pending
in
this
court.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
surely.
i
thought
i've
done
that
originally.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there
is
--
addressing
this
last
issue
first,
no
legal
difference
between
any
of
these
categories,
call
them
three
or
call
them
two.
i
understand
there
to
be
two.
a
daily
commuter
is
someone
who
comes
to
this
country
regularly
on
a
day-by-day
basis.
as
i
say
the
lines
are
frequently
hard
to
draw.
sometimes
they
come
twice
a
week
or
three
times
a
week
rather
than
daily,
but
they
are
regular
commuters.
some
of
them
come
to
permanent
job.
some
of
them
come
to
look
for
employment
everyday
or
to
look
for
a
temporary
employment.
it
matters
not,
because
the
only
reason
that
would
make
any
difference
is
if
you
agree
with
the
plaintiffs'
contention
here
that
these
people
must
be
treated
as
non-immigrants
if
they're
coming
to
perform
temporary
service.
it
just
doesn't
work.
the
definition
includes
what
mr.
terris
would
like
to
read
as
an
exclusion.
it
is
part
of
the
definition
that
if
there
are
people
available
to
perform
this
labor,
these
people
are
not
non-immigrants,
they're
immigrants,
and
the
only
way
they
can
come
into
this
country
is
either
with
an
immigrant
visa
or
with
an
informal
documentation
like
a
green
card.
so
there
are
two
classes
as
i
see
it.
i
think,
they
are
indistinguishable.
the
government's
position
as
i
understood
mr.
terris
is
to
be
is
that
they
stand
or
fall
together.
the
only
conceivable
distinction
aside
from
the
notion
that
one
class
is
non-immigrants
and
the
other
isn't
is
that
one
practice
has
lasted
longer.
but
the
practice
has
not
--
that
seasonal
commuter
practice
grew
up
really
at
a
time
after
a
series
of
temporary
measures
for
bringing
a
temporary
labor
into
the
country
had
expired
and
it
was
--
it's
not
a
new
legal
theory,
it
was
just
a
new
category
of
workers
who
took
advantage
of
what
was
already
there
for
their
benefit
already.
and
i
should
address
briefly
also
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
if
they
are
correct
on
one,
i
think,
they
are
wrong
on
the
other.
i
think,
the
decision
cannot
be
reconciled
of
the
two.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
the
daily
commuter,
whether
he
has
permanent
job
here
or
whether
he
comes
everyday
looking
for
job.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
suppose
if,
you
know,
now
that
the
problem
has
been
explored
through
litigation
that
the
regulations
about
which
we
have
some
reason
to
be
embarrassed
might
well
be
amended
and
the
service
would
like
to
amend
those
regulations
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
might
say
that
it
was
at
one
point
considered
whether
the
regulations
should
be
amended
to
correct
the
ambiguity,
but
it
was
determined,
i
think,
quite
rightly
that
it
would
be
improper
to
make
such
an
amendment,
while
the
case
is
in
litigation,
and
there
has
been
litigation
over
this
issue
ever
since
1966
when
the
case
was
instituted
in
the
ninth
circuit,
gooch
against
clark.
there's
never
been
a
time
when
we've
had
a
chance
to
make
any
amendments
without
interfering
with
ongoing
litigation.
