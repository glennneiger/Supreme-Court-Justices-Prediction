mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps,
the
most
important
purpose
of
the
immigration
laws
is
to
protect
domestic
labor
and
if
either
commuters
are
non-immigrants
or
they
are
immigrants
who
need
immigrant
visas
it
is
undisputed
that
they
cannot
come
into
the
united
states.
and
the
reason
they
can't
come
into
the
united
states
is
because
in
either
of
those
eventualities,
they
need
a
certification
by
the
department
of
labor,
which
states
that
they
are
not
domestic
workers
available
to
carry
out
that
work.
and
in
fact,
the
department
of
labor
has
determined,
there
is
domestic
labor
available
to
carry
out
the
work
of
agricultural
labor.
now,
it
is
possible
that
automobile
workers
or
workers
in
other
kinds
of
jobs,
could
come
into
the
united
states,
either
as
non-immigrants
or
as
immigrants
needing
immigrant
visas,
if
in
fact
they
were
not
--
there
was
not
domestic
labor
available
to
do
the
work
that
they
were
seeking
to
do.
but
this
case
involves
agricultural
labor
and
it
is
undisputed,
there
is
ample
domestic
agricultural
labor.
our
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
statutory
language
is
absolutely
clear.
we
do
not
rely
on
the
legislative
history.
hat
we
do
argue
is
that
such
legislative
history
is
there
is,
supports
our
position.
the
legislative
history
is
very
scant.
the
1950
report
is
not
an
affirmation
that
the
commuter
practice
was
legal.
it
is
part
of
a
lengthy
description
of
existing
immigration
practices
and
so
what
it
did
is
describe
and
describe
accurately
that
commuters
were
entering
the
united
states.
i
might
say
daily
commuters
at
that
time,
there
were
no
appreciable
number
of
seasonal
commuters.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
is
really
the
government's
position
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
they
didn't.
but
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that
that's
the
heart
of
the
government's
argument.
it's
the
--
let
me
come
back
to
that
in
a
moment.
the
government
in
its
lengthy
brief
and
in
its
submission,
it
doesn't
address
the
service's
own
description
of
what
the
commuter
practice
is
all
about.
the
service
admits
that
the
commuter
practice
is
an
amiable
fiction.
it
does
not
fit
within
statutory
language.
it
is
said
that
over
and
over
again
and
it's
cited
on
pages
45
to
47
of
our
brief,
their
description
of
what
the
commuter
practice
is
about.
and
so
despite
the
effort
now
to
try
to
fit
it
within
some
statutory
language,
i
think,
it's
a
fair
statement
that
it
doesn't
fit
very
well,
if
it
all,
within
any
statute.
the
basic
argument
of
the
government
is
that
this
is
going
on
for
a
long
time.
congress
has
not
changed
it.
there
had
been
various
bills
before
congress
at
different
times
to
change
it
and
that
that
ought
be
reason
enough
to
allow
the
practice
to
continue.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no,
45.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
for
example,
mr.
gordon,
the
general
counsel
of
the
service
says,
the
commuter
status
and
i'm
quoting
“the
devise
of
convenience”
“never
specifically
authorized
by
statute.”
there
are
lots
of
other
statements
of
that
kind
and
the
most
frequent
description
short
form
is
that
it's
an
amiable
fiction.
of
course,
how
amiable
it
is
really
depends
on
one's
point
of
view
in
the
litigation.
let
me
go
briefly
through
what
our
statutory
argument
is,
using
the
same
at
the
back
of
the
government's
brief
starting
on
page
79.
first
of
all
we
contend,
under
section
211
(b),
and
that's
the
starting
point,
if
they
cannot
come
within
section
211
(b),
then
they
have
to
have
immigrant
visas.
now,
211
(b)
starts
out
by
saying
that
they
have
to
be
“returning
resident
immigrants.”
now
the
government
admits
they're
not
residents.
now,
it's
interesting
what
the
government
does
to
--
let
me
just
state
briefly
what
the
statute
says
about
residence.
residence
is
defined
in
the
act
and
i
quote
“as
the
principal,
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact
without
regard
to
intent.”
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
was
coming
immediately
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
government
argues
that
the
defined
in
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
means
that
you
look
solely
to
section
101
(a)
27
(b),
and
that
that
definition
becomes
the
only
specification
that
has
to
be
satisfied.
i
suggest
at
the
very
least,
211
(b)
means
that
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
is
intended
to
be
a
definition
of
returning
resident
immigrants,
and
that
it
makes
extremely
little
sense
to
then
read
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
to
include
non-residents.
that
what
they've
in
effect
done
is
read
out
of
the
statute
entirely,
the
phrase
resident
in
211
(b).
now,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
our
position
insofar
as
it
was
dealing
with
daily
commuters,
i
mean,
seasonal
commuters.
but
it
said
as
to
daily
commuters,
the
daily
commuters
might
--
could
treat
their
place
of
employment
as
their
place
of
residence.
we
submit
that
that
is
directly
inconsistent
with
the
definition
of
residence
in
the
statute,
and
residence
is
explicitly
defined
as
i've
said
to
be
principal,
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact
without
regard
to
intent.
now,
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
a
place
of
employment
is
not
a
principal,
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact.
the
court
of
appeals
also
said
that
some
of
these
commuters
had
associations
and
interests
in
the
united
states.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
addressing
daily
because
the
court
or
appeals
for
some
reason,
which
isn't
entirely
clear,
did
not
make
the
same
type
of
argument
for
seasonals.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think,
that's
fair
your
honor.
i
think,
the
arguments
--
to
be
frank
about
it,
i
think,
the
arguments
in
favor
of
seasonals
may,
if
anything
be
stronger
than
for
dailies,
because
the
daily
commuter
never
even
puts
down
his
hat
in
a
dwelling
place
for
a
moment
in
the
united
states.
the
seasonal
at
least,
spends
a
few
months
in
the
united
states
with
a
place
which
might
be
called
a
temporary
residence
in
some
form.
now,
i
don't
think
that
comes
close
to
meeting
the
statutory
definition
of
a
principal,
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact,
but
it
least
comes
a
little
closer
to
it
than
the
daily
commuter.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
daily
--
no,
the
daily
commuter
your
honor
has
to
pay
taxes
insofar
as
he
earns
money
in
united
states,
but
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
exactly
right
and
they're
most
--
and
the
commuters
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
is
not
--
they're
not
eligible
for
naturalization
which
is
of
course
the
basic
reason
to
have
an
immigrant
visa.
they
are
rarely
subject
to
the
draft
over
the
last
few
years,
they
cannot
vote,
they
cannot
hold
office.
they're
essentially
for
all
other
purposes,
treated
as
--
totally
as
aliens
from
outside
the
country
and
the
service
for
this
one
purpose
has
treated
them
as
if
they
are
residents
of
this
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that's
probably
right
your
honor.
the
only
thing
i
think
that
can
be
said
that
distinguishes
them
in
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
distinguished
them,
is
the
difference
in
the
practice,
in
the
length
of
the
practice.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
seasonal
commuter
practice
as
the
service
has
admitted
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
is
up
until
which
--
was
in
the
early
60s,
there's
some
dispute
whether
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
now,
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
except
for
a
few
that
existed
before
that,
and
the
service
i
think
has
admitted
that
and
those
quotations
are
in
our
brief.
the
daily
commuter
practice
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
i
didn't
--
well,
it
depends
on
one's
--
it
depends
on
why
one
decides
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
your
honor.
if
the
practice,
the
length
of
the
practice
is
the
crucial
question,
then
the
court
of
appeals
determination
is
correct,
because
there
is
some
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
it
is.
and
i'd
like
to
address
myself
though
to
the
weight
of
that
how
long
the
daily
commuter
practice
has
been
in
existence.
the
daily
commuter
practice,
there
isn't
any
doubt,
in
form,
has
been
in
existence
since
the
1920s.
now
the
reason
i
say,
in
form,
is
that
up
until
1952
and
really
up
until
1968,
it
was
genuinely
a
pure
matter
of
convenience.
the
government
relies
very
heavily
on
an
order
and
i
think
it's
quoted
in
the
back
of
its
brief,
it's
--
the
service's
general
order,
i
guess
maybe
it's
in
the
petition
but
it's
a
--
no,
it's
in
the
back
of
their
brief,
general
order
number
86
page
83.
that
was
an
order
in
1927
which
authorized
the
daily
commuter
practice.
it
authorized
it
only
for
non-quota
immigrants.
now,
that
was
critical
because
what
it
meant
was,
this
was
a
pure
matter
of
convenience
in
the
1920s.
mexican
and
canadian
workers
have
the
right
to
come
into
the
united
states
as
immigrants
on
a
daily
basis.
there
was
no
quota.
there
was
no
labor
certification
necessary.
if
they've
been
required
to
get
an
immigrant
visa
everyday,
that
would
have
been
an
obvious
burden
on
them
and
on
the
service
and
it
made
no
point
because
they
were
entitled
to
one
everyday.
in
1952
for
the
first
time,
there
were
substantive
requirements
put
on
mexican
and
canadian
immigrants
coming
into
the
country.
for
the
first
time,
the
department
of
labor
could
certify
that
there
were
ample
workers
available,
and
therefore,
the
immigrant
couldn't
come
to
the
united
states.
in
1965,
that
was
taken
further
by
saying,
unless
he
found
that
there
were
no
workers
available,
then
you
couldn't
come
in
the
united
states.
in
1968
for
the
first
time,
a
quota
was
imposed
on
mexican
aliens.
now,
that's
the
time,
this
period,
whether
it's
1968
or
1965
or
1952,
one
could
debate
as
the
crucial
date.
but
it's
one
of
those
dates
anyway
that
is
the
crucial
time
when
this
practice
meant
something,
because
what
it
meant
at
that
time,
for
the
first
time,
was
that
this
practice
was
allowed,
was
being
used
to
evade
substantive
provisions
of
the
act.
and
that's
when,
in
our
view,
one
should
start
to
date
the
commuter
practice,
because
up
to
then,
it
was
a
matter
of
convenience,
up
to
then,
it
could
be
called
an
amiable
fiction.
after
1952
is
when
it
had
substantive
ramifications.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
this
case
does
not
involve
them
in
anyway
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
in
all
the
reading
i've
done
on
the
subject
that
the
illegals
has
never
been
considered
the
same
time
as
this.
i
don't
believe
it's
part
of
the
--
that
it's
been
considered
at
anytime
as
part
of
the
same
subject
matter.
i
might
say
on
the
question
of
the
numbers,
the
numbers
particularly
of
seasonal
is
very
hotly
disputed.
the
government's
figures
of
8,000
coming
across
the
southwest
border,
but
there
was
an
amicus
brief,
for
example,
which
has
been
submitted
by
the
farm
bureau
federation
in
this
case
which
has
an
estimate,
i
think,
in
the
hundreds
of
thousands.
it's
a
matter
of
very
great
dispute
and
the
government
believes
that
it
has
very
strong
controls
in
the
border
and
knows
how
many
are
coming
across.
and
both
the
farm
workers
and
the
farmers
apparently
believe
those
controls
don't
really
exist
and
the
government
doesn't
know
how
many
are
coming
across.
let
me
go
back
to
section
101
(a)
27
(b).
there
is
one
bit
of
legislative
history
which
the
government
has
referred
to,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
referred
to
as
being
an
obscure
bit
of
legislative
history.
in
1963,
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
general
counsel
of
the
service
and
a
staff
member
before
subcommittee,
the
house
judiciary
committee.
the
general
counsel
of
the
service
said,
the
commuter
practice
was
not
based
on
section
101
(a)
27
(b).
he
said
it
did
not
come
within
that
section,
because
it
was
not
a
temporary
visit
abroad.
he
said,
it
came
within
section
211
(b).
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
it's
cited
on
page
33
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
of
our
brief.
he
said
he
was
relying
on
section
211
(b).
in
1965,
two
years
later,
in
a
bill
that
obviously
came
through
the
house
judiciary
committee,
the
phraseology
of
section
211
(b)
was
changed,
and
211
(b)
was
modified
to
refer
deliberately
and
directly
to
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
which
had
previously
been
said,
not
to
allow
the
commuter
practice.
of
course,
subsequently
to
that
the
service
now
says
that
the
language
in
section
101
(a)
27
(b),
does
allow
it.
now
we
submit
that
in
fact
what
the
service
has
done,
although
its
practice
may
have
continued
unbroken,
its
basic
legal
position
has
changed
completely.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
standing
was
litigated
your
honor
and
the
district
court
found
that
they
did
have
standing.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
only
--
since
this
was
--
there
was
no
trial
of
any
kind,
either
on
the
merits
around
them
or
on
any
jurisdictional
questions,
all
it
has
is
the
allegations
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
but
the
alleged
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
there
were
two
individual
plaintiffs
in
the
farm
workers
organizing
committee.
the
farm
workers
organizing
committee,
of
course,
represents
domestic
farm
workers
in
the
southwest.
the
two
individual
people
were
farm
workers,
one
was
a
us
citizen
and
one
was
an
actual
resident
alien
of
the
southwest.
the
intervenors
were
those
people
who
were
all
from
california.
the
intervenors
were
farm
workers,
domestic
farm
workers
in
texas.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
they
were
all
--
well,
there
was
no
specific
allegation
your
honor.
they
alleged
that
they
were
farm
workers.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
but
there
was
never
any
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
some
farm
workers,
originally
it
was
farm
workers
in
california
than
the
intervenors,
who
was
farm
workers
in
texas.
now
in
order
to
fit
within
section
101
(a)
27
(b),
the
commuters
have
to
be
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
the
phrase
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
is
used
in
a
number
of
other
sections
of
the
act.
in
all
the
other
sections
of
the
act,
i
think,
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
would
be
almost
incredible
for
congress
to
have
intended,
to
have
included
commuters.
let
me
just
give
one
example.
if
commuters
are
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence,
it
comes
within
a
provision
which
states
that
a
spouse,
parent,
or
child
of
a
citizen
or
of
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence,
can
enter
the
united
states
without
a
department
of
labor
certification
that
no
domestic
workers
are
available.
now,
what
this
would
mean
is
that
these
commuters
could
bring
in
any
of
their
relatives,
including
their
children,
and
one
would
have
built
into
this
system,
a
permanent
exemption
from
the
labor
certification
requirements,
because
the
exemption
could
be
passed
on
from
generation
to
generation.
now,
the
government
says,
those
issues
as
to
the
other
sections
can
be
put
aside
for
the
purposes
of
this
litigation
and
they
can
be
determined
some
other
time.
but
the
statute
says
that
this
definition
of
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
is
a
definition
for
the
entire
statute.
and
the
house
report
says,
that's
why
this
very
definition
is
so
important,
because
it
does
have
many
ramifications.
and
we
submit
that
whatever
rule
is
adopted
in
this
case,
has
got
to
be
a
rule
that
will
apply
to
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
for
all
of
its
uses
in
the
statute.
let
me
go
to
the
second
part
of
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
which
relates
to
returning
from
a
temporary
visit
abroad
and
the
chief
justice
had
a
colloquy
with
counsel
about,
whether
it
goes
to
a
visit
into
the
southern
france.
that
phrase
actually
dates
back
in
the
statute
until
1921,
and
there
have
been
several
cases
decided
under
it
and
they
are
cited
in
our
brief.
and
those
cases
may
clear
that
that
visit
to
southern
france
is
exactly
what
the
intent
was
of
that
kind
--
of
that
provision.
it
was
intended
and
this
is
what
the
secretary
of
labor
determined
back
in
1924
and
that
was
the
time
when
he
was
the
enforcer
of
the
immigration
laws
and
by
number
of
other
courts
to
apply
only
to
persons
with
domiciles
in
this
country,
not
just
residence,
domicile.
now,
it's
obvious
that
commuters
not
only
don't
have
residences,
but
they
clearly
don't
have
domiciles
here
either.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
regulations.
we
submit
that
even
if
and
of
course
we
argue
that
they
don't,
but
even
if
they
came
within
section
211
(b)
and
section
101
(a)
27
(b),
they
still
wouldn't
be
admissible.
the
regulations
somehow
were
even
stronger
than
the
statute,
they
allow
a
person
to
come
--
an
alien
to
come
in
without
an
immigrant
visa
and
i'm
quoting
“only
if
they
are
returning
to
an
un-relinquished,
lawful,
permanent
residence
in
the
united
states
after
a
temporary
absence
abroad.”
now,
it's
hard
to
imagine
how
anybody
could
write
language
which
is
more
clear
that
you've
got
to
have
residence
in
this
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
1957.
they
came
after
the
1952
statute.
the
interesting
thing
is
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
until
1952,
there
were
regulations
specifically
allowing
commuters
to
come
in
without
an
immigration
visa.
those
were
revoked
after
the
1952
statute.
there
was
no
clear
replacement
as
to
commuters.
then
in
1957,
this
language
was
adopted.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
in
our
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
in
our
brief,
i
know,
maybe
in
the
government's
too,
it's
at
the
bottom
of
page
5
of
our
brief.
and
that
phrase
by
the
way
occurs
on
seven
separate
times
in
that
section
in
the
following
section
of
the
regulations.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
it's
obviously
not
inadvertence.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
think
that
was
actually
first
composed
by
the
--
in
the
regulations
your
honor
at
least
i
don't
know
of
the
previous
use
of
that
phrase.
now
up
until
this
court,
the
government
has
consistently
contended,
that
has
consistently
admitted
that
commuters
don't
come
within
that
language.
they
admitted
that
in
the
courts
below
in
this
case
and
in
gooch
v.
clark
which
is
the
prior
ninth
circuit
case
on
this
subject,
they
not
only
admitted
it,
but
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
them.
the
government
argued
up
to
now,
that
it
didn't
matter
whether
they
came
within
the
regulations.
it
said
that
that
regulation
was
only
just
permissive
of
what
--
of
when
people
could
come
in,
that
outside
of
any
regulations,
they
can
allow
people
into
the
country
under
the
practice.
now
that
position,
i
think,
is
so
flagrantly
wrong,
that's
why
it's
been
abandoned.
it's
wrong
because
section
211
(b)
makes
very
clear
that
the
only
basis
for
coming
into
the
country
without
an
immigrant
visa
is
pursuant
to
regulations,
and
i
think
that
that
is
clearly
right.
i
think
that's
the
government's
position
today.
now
the
government
therefore
goes
back
to
the
language
of
the
regulations,
and
what
it
says
is,
despite
that
language
of
un-relinquished,
lawful,
permanent
residence,
it
doesn't
mean
that.
it
says
it's
not
artfully
drawn,
that
what
the
regulations
and
that's
their
word,
that
what
the
regulations
really
mean
is
the
status
of
coming
in
to
the
united
states,
but
we
submit
that
that's
simply
rewriting
the
regulations
that
the
regulations
are
clear
on
their
face.
let
me
turn
now
to
our
argument
that
these
--
that
most
of
these
commuters
are
really
non-immigrants.
when
i
say
most,
commuters
who
come
to
this
country,
took
permanent
employment,
are
not
non-immigrants.
and
when
i
say
that,
i'm
now
talking
essentially
of
nonagricultural
commuters.
nonagricultural
commuters
who
come
to
an
automobile
plant
in
detroit
or
some
other
plant
all
through
the
year
to
permanent
employment,
are
not
non-immigrants.
that
is
clear
under
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
agricultural
workers,
i
think,
were
perhaps
some
rare
exception,
that
don't
--
do
not
have
permanent
employments
in
this
country.
they
come
for
a
few
months
and
generally
not
even
to
the
same
employer
as
has
been
described
before,
they
have
a
lot
of
different
employers.
they
only
come
for
a
few
months
of
the
year.
then
maybe
a
few
months
later
on.
i
think
it's
very
clear
to
what
they
--
they
come
to
the
united
states
temporarily.
they
do
not
come
for
permanent
employment.
now
section
101
(a)
15
(h)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
our
argument
as
to
if
they
are
an
immigrant,
there
is
no
distinction.
i
want
to
be
clear
about
that.
the
argument
i've
made
up
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
yes,
sir.
the
only
difference
that
would
apply
to
them
is
that
an
automobile
worker
might
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this
might
be
able
to
come
in
the
united
states
because
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
as
an
immigrant
because
he
maybe
able
to
get
a
department
of
labor
certification.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
so
that's
the
only
difference
if
we
assume
that
they
are
immigrants.
if
they
are
non-immigrants,
my
argument
is
based
squarely
on
the
language
of
subsection
(h),
and
let
me
just
--
it's
--
well,
let
me
give
the
exact
citation.
it's
on
page
79
of
the
government's
brief,
it's
101
(a)
15
(h).
that
states
that
a
person
is
a
non-immigrant,
that
an
alien
having
a
residence
in
a
foreign
country,
that's
obviously
a
commuter
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
okay.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
right
about
in
the
middle
of
the
page
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
an
alien
having
a
residence
in
a
foreign
country
which
he
has
no
intention
of
abandoning,
that
so
far
is
a
commuter.
then
we
drop
down
to
(ii),
who
is
coming
temporarily
to
the
united
states,
he
surely
is
coming
just
temporarily
to
perform
temporary
services
or
labor.
now,
that
requires
both
that
you
come
temporarily
and
that
the
services
or
labor
be
temporary.
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
service
and
we
do
agree
with
this
that
if
a
person
comes
to
the
united
states
temporarily
but
to
carry
out
permanent
services
or
labor,
he
is
not
a
non-immigrant.
so
a
daily
commuter
who
comes
across
the
border
daily
and
that
his
visit
is
temporary
but
he,
if
he
works
in
an
automobile
plant
on
a
permanent
basis,
he's
not
a
non-immigrant.
i
think,
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
you
come
many
times
temporarily
but
the
job
is
a
permanent
one
your
honor.
that
is
the
service's
interpretation
of
that
phrase
to
and
we
do
agree
with
it.
now
what
the
service
says,
however,
is
that's
not
the
end
of
the
definition.
that
the
end
of
the
definition
is,
if
unemployed
person
is
capable
of
performing
such
service
or
labor,
cannot
be
found
in
this
country.
now,
we
submit
that
isn't
part
of
the
definition.
that
the
definition
is
the
description
of
the
people
themselves
and
not
the
rule
which
is
clearly
--
which
is
really
an
analogous
to
the
rule
for
immigrants
which
is
in
section
212
(a)
(14),
which
says
to
an
immigrant
that
if
you
can't
get
a
department
of
labor
certification,
you
can't
come
in
to
this
country.
this
is
the
analogous
provision
for
non-immigrants.
if
the
service's
position
were
correct,
it
would
mean
that
different
kinds
of
people
coming
for
in
the
same
way,
same
temporary
basis,
some
of
them
could
come
in
as
non-immigrants.
some
of
them
would
be
non-immigrants,
some
of
them
would
not
be
non-immigrants,
purely
depending
on
the
kind
of
occupation
that
was
involved
and
even
the
time
a
year,
there
would
be
no
in
effect
--
in
effect
there
would
be
no
general
classification
of
non-immigrants.
and
we
submit
that
the
definition
is
the
beginning
of
this
phrase,
the
latter
is
the
condition
upon
which
you
can
enter.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think,
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think,
that's
really
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
reason
the
third
is
--
i
think,
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
third
is
like
all
other
daily
commuters
allowed
to
keep
coming
into
the
united
states.
the
third
category
that
your
honor
stated
correctly
is
part
of
the
daily
commuter
category.
there
are
no
seasonal
commuters
that
come
--
by
definition,
a
seasonal
commuter
isn't
--
can't
be
permanent.
and
so
it's
part
of
the
dailies.
we
have
never
litigated
anybody,
of
course,
but
the
agricultural
workers.
and
so
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think,
it's
really
fair
to
say
it's
outside
the
litigation.
now,
i
don't
want
to,
however,
ignore
it
such
that
an
effect,
i
say
that
don't
think
about
it
as
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
your
honor.
let
me
tell
you
--
let
me
explain
what
happened
on
it.
the
court
of
appeals
only
dealt
with
these
first
two
categories,
seasonal
and
dailies.
we
then
said,
we
thought,
based
on
their
wording
in
describing
dailies,
we
thought
that
what
--
the
way
they
described
dailies
that
they
meant
the
dailies
who
have
permanent
jobs
can
continue
to
enter
the
united
states,
but
they
didn't
meant
to
allow
dailies
who
were
agricultural
workers
to
do
so,
and
we
asked
for
clarification
in
a
motion
after
the
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
give
clarification
and
said
that
it
had
given
--
it
had
explained
itself
enough
and
that
the
district
court
could
deal
with
that
question
on
remand
on
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
rather
not
categorize
that
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps,
the
most
important
purpose
of
the
immigration
laws
is
to
protect
domestic
labor
and
if
either
commuters
are
non-immigrants
or
they
are
immigrants
who
need
immigrant
visas
it
is
undisputed
that
they
cannot
come
into
the
united
states.
and
the
reason
they
can't
come
into
the
united
states
is
because
in
either
of
those
eventualities,
they
need
a
certification
by
the
department
of
labor,
which
states
that
they
are
not
domestic
workers
available
to
carry
out
that
work.
and
in
fact,
the
department
of
labor
has
determined,
there
is
domestic
labor
available
to
carry
out
the
work
of
agricultural
labor.
now,
it
is
possible
that
automobile
workers
or
workers
in
other
kinds
of
jobs,
could
come
into
the
united
states,
either
as
non-immigrants
or
as
immigrants
needing
immigrant
visas,
if
in
fact
they
were
not
--
there
was
not
domestic
labor
available
to
do
the
work
that
they
were
seeking
to
do.
but
this
case
involves
agricultural
labor
and
it
is
undisputed,
there
is
ample
domestic
agricultural
labor.
our
basic
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
statutory
language
is
absolutely
clear.
we
do
not
rely
on
the
legislative
history.
hat
we
do
argue
is
that
such
legislative
history
is
there
is,
supports
our
position.
the
legislative
history
is
very
scant.
the
1950
report
is
not
an
affirmation
that
the
commuter
practice
was
legal.
it
is
part
of
a
lengthy
description
of
existing
immigration
practices
and
so
what
it
did
is
describe
and
describe
accurately
that
commuters
were
entering
the
united
states.
i
might
say
daily
commuters
at
that
time,
there
were
no
appreciable
number
of
seasonal
commuters.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that
is
really
the
government's
position
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
they
didn't.
but
i
think
that's
--
i
think
that
that's
the
heart
of
the
government's
argument.
it's
the
--
let
me
come
back
to
that
in
a
moment.
the
government
in
its
lengthy
brief
and
in
its
submission,
it
doesn't
address
the
service's
own
description
of
what
the
commuter
practice
is
all
about.
the
service
admits
that
the
commuter
practice
is
an
amiable
fiction.
it
does
not
fit
within
statutory
language.
it
is
said
that
over
and
over
again
and
it's
cited
on
pages
45
to
47
of
our
brief,
their
description
of
what
the
commuter
practice
is
about.
and
so
despite
the
effort
now
to
try
to
fit
it
within
some
statutory
language,
i
think,
it's
a
fair
statement
that
it
doesn't
fit
very
well,
if
it
all,
within
any
statute.
the
basic
argument
of
the
government
is
that
this
is
going
on
for
a
long
time.
congress
has
not
changed
it.
there
had
been
various
bills
before
congress
at
different
times
to
change
it
and
that
that
ought
be
reason
enough
to
allow
the
practice
to
continue.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
no,
45.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
for
example,
mr.
gordon,
the
general
counsel
of
the
service
says,
the
commuter
status
and
i'm
quoting
“the
devise
of
convenience”
“never
specifically
authorized
by
statute.”
there
are
lots
of
other
statements
of
that
kind
and
the
most
frequent
description
short
form
is
that
it's
an
amiable
fiction.
of
course,
how
amiable
it
is
really
depends
on
one's
point
of
view
in
the
litigation.
let
me
go
briefly
through
what
our
statutory
argument
is,
using
the
same
at
the
back
of
the
government's
brief
starting
on
page
79.
first
of
all
we
contend,
under
section
211
(b),
and
that's
the
starting
point,
if
they
cannot
come
within
section
211
(b),
then
they
have
to
have
immigrant
visas.
now,
211
(b)
starts
out
by
saying
that
they
have
to
be
“returning
resident
immigrants.”
now
the
government
admits
they're
not
residents.
now,
it's
interesting
what
the
government
does
to
--
let
me
just
state
briefly
what
the
statute
says
about
residence.
residence
is
defined
in
the
act
and
i
quote
“as
the
principal,
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact
without
regard
to
intent.”
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
was
coming
immediately
to
that
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
government
argues
that
the
defined
in
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
means
that
you
look
solely
to
section
101
(a)
27
(b),
and
that
that
definition
becomes
the
only
specification
that
has
to
be
satisfied.
i
suggest
at
the
very
least,
211
(b)
means
that
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
is
intended
to
be
a
definition
of
returning
resident
immigrants,
and
that
it
makes
extremely
little
sense
to
then
read
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
to
include
non-residents.
that
what
they've
in
effect
done
is
read
out
of
the
statute
entirely,
the
phrase
resident
in
211
(b).
now,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
our
position
insofar
as
it
was
dealing
with
daily
commuters,
i
mean,
seasonal
commuters.
but
it
said
as
to
daily
commuters,
the
daily
commuters
might
--
could
treat
their
place
of
employment
as
their
place
of
residence.
we
submit
that
that
is
directly
inconsistent
with
the
definition
of
residence
in
the
statute,
and
residence
is
explicitly
defined
as
i've
said
to
be
principal,
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact
without
regard
to
intent.
now,
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
a
place
of
employment
is
not
a
principal,
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact.
the
court
of
appeals
also
said
that
some
of
these
commuters
had
associations
and
interests
in
the
united
states.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i'm
addressing
daily
because
the
court
or
appeals
for
some
reason,
which
isn't
entirely
clear,
did
not
make
the
same
type
of
argument
for
seasonals.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think,
that's
fair
your
honor.
i
think,
the
arguments
--
to
be
frank
about
it,
i
think,
the
arguments
in
favor
of
seasonals
may,
if
anything
be
stronger
than
for
dailies,
because
the
daily
commuter
never
even
puts
down
his
hat
in
a
dwelling
place
for
a
moment
in
the
united
states.
the
seasonal
at
least,
spends
a
few
months
in
the
united
states
with
a
place
which
might
be
called
a
temporary
residence
in
some
form.
now,
i
don't
think
that
comes
close
to
meeting
the
statutory
definition
of
a
principal,
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact,
but
it
least
comes
a
little
closer
to
it
than
the
daily
commuter.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
the
daily
--
no,
the
daily
commuter
your
honor
has
to
pay
taxes
insofar
as
he
earns
money
in
united
states,
but
that's
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
exactly
right
and
they're
most
--
and
the
commuters
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
he
is
not
--
they're
not
eligible
for
naturalization
which
is
of
course
the
basic
reason
to
have
an
immigrant
visa.
they
are
rarely
subject
to
the
draft
over
the
last
few
years,
they
cannot
vote,
they
cannot
hold
office.
they're
essentially
for
all
other
purposes,
treated
as
--
totally
as
aliens
from
outside
the
country
and
the
service
for
this
one
purpose
has
treated
them
as
if
they
are
residents
of
this
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think
that's
probably
right
your
honor.
the
only
thing
i
think
that
can
be
said
that
distinguishes
them
in
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
distinguished
them,
is
the
difference
in
the
practice,
in
the
length
of
the
practice.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
seasonal
commuter
practice
as
the
service
has
admitted
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
is
up
until
which
--
was
in
the
early
60s,
there's
some
dispute
whether
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
now,
the
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
except
for
a
few
that
existed
before
that,
and
the
service
i
think
has
admitted
that
and
those
quotations
are
in
our
brief.
the
daily
commuter
practice
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no.
i
didn't
--
well,
it
depends
on
one's
--
it
depends
on
why
one
decides
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
your
honor.
if
the
practice,
the
length
of
the
practice
is
the
crucial
question,
then
the
court
of
appeals
determination
is
correct,
because
there
is
some
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
it
is.
and
i'd
like
to
address
myself
though
to
the
weight
of
that
how
long
the
daily
commuter
practice
has
been
in
existence.
the
daily
commuter
practice,
there
isn't
any
doubt,
in
form,
has
been
in
existence
since
the
1920s.
now
the
reason
i
say,
in
form,
is
that
up
until
1952
and
really
up
until
1968,
it
was
genuinely
a
pure
matter
of
convenience.
the
government
relies
very
heavily
on
an
order
and
i
think
it's
quoted
in
the
back
of
its
brief,
it's
--
the
service's
general
order,
i
guess
maybe
it's
in
the
petition
but
it's
a
--
no,
it's
in
the
back
of
their
brief,
general
order
number
86
page
83.
that
was
an
order
in
1927
which
authorized
the
daily
commuter
practice.
it
authorized
it
only
for
non-quota
immigrants.
now,
that
was
critical
because
what
it
meant
was,
this
was
a
pure
matter
of
convenience
in
the
1920s.
mexican
and
canadian
workers
have
the
right
to
come
into
the
united
states
as
immigrants
on
a
daily
basis.
there
was
no
quota.
there
was
no
labor
certification
necessary.
if
they've
been
required
to
get
an
immigrant
visa
everyday,
that
would
have
been
an
obvious
burden
on
them
and
on
the
service
and
it
made
no
point
because
they
were
entitled
to
one
everyday.
in
1952
for
the
first
time,
there
were
substantive
requirements
put
on
mexican
and
canadian
immigrants
coming
into
the
country.
for
the
first
time,
the
department
of
labor
could
certify
that
there
were
ample
workers
available,
and
therefore,
the
immigrant
couldn't
come
to
the
united
states.
in
1965,
that
was
taken
further
by
saying,
unless
he
found
that
there
were
no
workers
available,
then
you
couldn't
come
in
the
united
states.
in
1968
for
the
first
time,
a
quota
was
imposed
on
mexican
aliens.
now,
that's
the
time,
this
period,
whether
it's
1968
or
1965
or
1952,
one
could
debate
as
the
crucial
date.
but
it's
one
of
those
dates
anyway
that
is
the
crucial
time
when
this
practice
meant
something,
because
what
it
meant
at
that
time,
for
the
first
time,
was
that
this
practice
was
allowed,
was
being
used
to
evade
substantive
provisions
of
the
act.
and
that's
when,
in
our
view,
one
should
start
to
date
the
commuter
practice,
because
up
to
then,
it
was
a
matter
of
convenience,
up
to
then,
it
could
be
called
an
amiable
fiction.
after
1952
is
when
it
had
substantive
ramifications.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
this
case
does
not
involve
them
in
anyway
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
your
honor,
in
all
the
reading
i've
done
on
the
subject
that
the
illegals
has
never
been
considered
the
same
time
as
this.
i
don't
believe
it's
part
of
the
--
that
it's
been
considered
at
anytime
as
part
of
the
same
subject
matter.
i
might
say
on
the
question
of
the
numbers,
the
numbers
particularly
of
seasonal
is
very
hotly
disputed.
the
government's
figures
of
8,000
coming
across
the
southwest
border,
but
there
was
an
amicus
brief,
for
example,
which
has
been
submitted
by
the
farm
bureau
federation
in
this
case
which
has
an
estimate,
i
think,
in
the
hundreds
of
thousands.
it's
a
matter
of
very
great
dispute
and
the
government
believes
that
it
has
very
strong
controls
in
the
border
and
knows
how
many
are
coming
across.
and
both
the
farm
workers
and
the
farmers
apparently
believe
those
controls
don't
really
exist
and
the
government
doesn't
know
how
many
are
coming
across.
let
me
go
back
to
section
101
(a)
27
(b).
there
is
one
bit
of
legislative
history
which
the
government
has
referred
to,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
referred
to
as
being
an
obscure
bit
of
legislative
history.
in
1963,
there
was
a
colloquy
between
the
general
counsel
of
the
service
and
a
staff
member
before
subcommittee,
the
house
judiciary
committee.
the
general
counsel
of
the
service
said,
the
commuter
practice
was
not
based
on
section
101
(a)
27
(b).
he
said
it
did
not
come
within
that
section,
because
it
was
not
a
temporary
visit
abroad.
he
said,
it
came
within
section
211
(b).
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
it's
cited
on
page
33
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
--
of
our
brief.
he
said
he
was
relying
on
section
211
(b).
in
1965,
two
years
later,
in
a
bill
that
obviously
came
through
the
house
judiciary
committee,
the
phraseology
of
section
211
(b)
was
changed,
and
211
(b)
was
modified
to
refer
deliberately
and
directly
to
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
which
had
previously
been
said,
not
to
allow
the
commuter
practice.
of
course,
subsequently
to
that
the
service
now
says
that
the
language
in
section
101
(a)
27
(b),
does
allow
it.
now
we
submit
that
in
fact
what
the
service
has
done,
although
its
practice
may
have
continued
unbroken,
its
basic
legal
position
has
changed
completely.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
standing
was
litigated
your
honor
and
the
district
court
found
that
they
did
have
standing.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
only
--
since
this
was
--
there
was
no
trial
of
any
kind,
either
on
the
merits
around
them
or
on
any
jurisdictional
questions,
all
it
has
is
the
allegations
that
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right,
but
the
alleged
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
there
were
two
individual
plaintiffs
in
the
farm
workers
organizing
committee.
the
farm
workers
organizing
committee,
of
course,
represents
domestic
farm
workers
in
the
southwest.
the
two
individual
people
were
farm
workers,
one
was
a
us
citizen
and
one
was
an
actual
resident
alien
of
the
southwest.
the
intervenors
were
those
people
who
were
all
from
california.
the
intervenors
were
farm
workers,
domestic
farm
workers
in
texas.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
they
were
all
--
well,
there
was
no
specific
allegation
your
honor.
they
alleged
that
they
were
farm
workers.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes,
but
there
was
never
any
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
some
farm
workers,
originally
it
was
farm
workers
in
california
than
the
intervenors,
who
was
farm
workers
in
texas.
now
in
order
to
fit
within
section
101
(a)
27
(b),
the
commuters
have
to
be
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
the
phrase
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
is
used
in
a
number
of
other
sections
of
the
act.
in
all
the
other
sections
of
the
act,
i
think,
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
would
be
almost
incredible
for
congress
to
have
intended,
to
have
included
commuters.
let
me
just
give
one
example.
if
commuters
are
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence,
it
comes
within
a
provision
which
states
that
a
spouse,
parent,
or
child
of
a
citizen
or
of
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence,
can
enter
the
united
states
without
a
department
of
labor
certification
that
no
domestic
workers
are
available.
now,
what
this
would
mean
is
that
these
commuters
could
bring
in
any
of
their
relatives,
including
their
children,
and
one
would
have
built
into
this
system,
a
permanent
exemption
from
the
labor
certification
requirements,
because
the
exemption
could
be
passed
on
from
generation
to
generation.
now,
the
government
says,
those
issues
as
to
the
other
sections
can
be
put
aside
for
the
purposes
of
this
litigation
and
they
can
be
determined
some
other
time.
but
the
statute
says
that
this
definition
of
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
is
a
definition
for
the
entire
statute.
and
the
house
report
says,
that's
why
this
very
definition
is
so
important,
because
it
does
have
many
ramifications.
and
we
submit
that
whatever
rule
is
adopted
in
this
case,
has
got
to
be
a
rule
that
will
apply
to
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
for
all
of
its
uses
in
the
statute.
let
me
go
to
the
second
part
of
section
101
(a)
27
(b)
which
relates
to
returning
from
a
temporary
visit
abroad
and
the
chief
justice
had
a
colloquy
with
counsel
about,
whether
it
goes
to
a
visit
into
the
southern
france.
that
phrase
actually
dates
back
in
the
statute
until
1921,
and
there
have
been
several
cases
decided
under
it
and
they
are
cited
in
our
brief.
and
those
cases
may
clear
that
that
visit
to
southern
france
is
exactly
what
the
intent
was
of
that
kind
--
of
that
provision.
it
was
intended
and
this
is
what
the
secretary
of
labor
determined
back
in
1924
and
that
was
the
time
when
he
was
the
enforcer
of
the
immigration
laws
and
by
number
of
other
courts
to
apply
only
to
persons
with
domiciles
in
this
country,
not
just
residence,
domicile.
now,
it's
obvious
that
commuters
not
only
don't
have
residences,
but
they
clearly
don't
have
domiciles
here
either.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
regulations.
we
submit
that
even
if
and
of
course
we
argue
that
they
don't,
but
even
if
they
came
within
section
211
(b)
and
section
101
(a)
27
(b),
they
still
wouldn't
be
admissible.
the
regulations
somehow
were
even
stronger
than
the
statute,
they
allow
a
person
to
come
--
an
alien
to
come
in
without
an
immigrant
visa
and
i'm
quoting
“only
if
they
are
returning
to
an
un-relinquished,
lawful,
permanent
residence
in
the
united
states
after
a
temporary
absence
abroad.”
now,
it's
hard
to
imagine
how
anybody
could
write
language
which
is
more
clear
that
you've
got
to
have
residence
in
this
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
1957.
they
came
after
the
1952
statute.
the
interesting
thing
is
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
until
1952,
there
were
regulations
specifically
allowing
commuters
to
come
in
without
an
immigration
visa.
those
were
revoked
after
the
1952
statute.
there
was
no
clear
replacement
as
to
commuters.
then
in
1957,
this
language
was
adopted.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
in
our
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
in
our
brief,
i
know,
maybe
in
the
government's
too,
it's
at
the
bottom
of
page
5
of
our
brief.
and
that
phrase
by
the
way
occurs
on
seven
separate
times
in
that
section
in
the
following
section
of
the
regulations.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
it's
obviously
not
inadvertence.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
i
think
that
was
actually
first
composed
by
the
--
in
the
regulations
your
honor
at
least
i
don't
know
of
the
previous
use
of
that
phrase.
now
up
until
this
court,
the
government
has
consistently
contended,
that
has
consistently
admitted
that
commuters
don't
come
within
that
language.
they
admitted
that
in
the
courts
below
in
this
case
and
in
gooch
v.
clark
which
is
the
prior
ninth
circuit
case
on
this
subject,
they
not
only
admitted
it,
but
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
them.
the
government
argued
up
to
now,
that
it
didn't
matter
whether
they
came
within
the
regulations.
it
said
that
that
regulation
was
only
just
permissive
of
what
--
of
when
people
could
come
in,
that
outside
of
any
regulations,
they
can
allow
people
into
the
country
under
the
practice.
now
that
position,
i
think,
is
so
flagrantly
wrong,
that's
why
it's
been
abandoned.
it's
wrong
because
section
211
(b)
makes
very
clear
that
the
only
basis
for
coming
into
the
country
without
an
immigrant
visa
is
pursuant
to
regulations,
and
i
think
that
that
is
clearly
right.
i
think
that's
the
government's
position
today.
now
the
government
therefore
goes
back
to
the
language
of
the
regulations,
and
what
it
says
is,
despite
that
language
of
un-relinquished,
lawful,
permanent
residence,
it
doesn't
mean
that.
it
says
it's
not
artfully
drawn,
that
what
the
regulations
and
that's
their
word,
that
what
the
regulations
really
mean
is
the
status
of
coming
in
to
the
united
states,
but
we
submit
that
that's
simply
rewriting
the
regulations
that
the
regulations
are
clear
on
their
face.
let
me
turn
now
to
our
argument
that
these
--
that
most
of
these
commuters
are
really
non-immigrants.
when
i
say
most,
commuters
who
come
to
this
country,
took
permanent
employment,
are
not
non-immigrants.
and
when
i
say
that,
i'm
now
talking
essentially
of
nonagricultural
commuters.
nonagricultural
commuters
who
come
to
an
automobile
plant
in
detroit
or
some
other
plant
all
through
the
year
to
permanent
employment,
are
not
non-immigrants.
that
is
clear
under
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
agricultural
workers,
i
think,
were
perhaps
some
rare
exception,
that
don't
--
do
not
have
permanent
employments
in
this
country.
they
come
for
a
few
months
and
generally
not
even
to
the
same
employer
as
has
been
described
before,
they
have
a
lot
of
different
employers.
they
only
come
for
a
few
months
of
the
year.
then
maybe
a
few
months
later
on.
i
think
it's
very
clear
to
what
they
--
they
come
to
the
united
states
temporarily.
they
do
not
come
for
permanent
employment.
now
section
101
(a)
15
(h)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
mr.
chief
justice,
our
argument
as
to
if
they
are
an
immigrant,
there
is
no
distinction.
i
want
to
be
clear
about
that.
the
argument
i've
made
up
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
yes.
yes,
sir.
the
only
difference
that
would
apply
to
them
is
that
an
automobile
worker
might
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this
might
be
able
to
come
in
the
united
states
because
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no,
as
an
immigrant
because
he
maybe
able
to
get
a
department
of
labor
certification.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
that's
right.
so
that's
the
only
difference
if
we
assume
that
they
are
immigrants.
if
they
are
non-immigrants,
my
argument
is
based
squarely
on
the
language
of
subsection
(h),
and
let
me
just
--
it's
--
well,
let
me
give
the
exact
citation.
it's
on
page
79
of
the
government's
brief,
it's
101
(a)
15
(h).
that
states
that
a
person
is
a
non-immigrant,
that
an
alien
having
a
residence
in
a
foreign
country,
that's
obviously
a
commuter
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
okay.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
it's
right
about
in
the
middle
of
the
page
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
an
alien
having
a
residence
in
a
foreign
country
which
he
has
no
intention
of
abandoning,
that
so
far
is
a
commuter.
then
we
drop
down
to
(ii),
who
is
coming
temporarily
to
the
united
states,
he
surely
is
coming
just
temporarily
to
perform
temporary
services
or
labor.
now,
that
requires
both
that
you
come
temporarily
and
that
the
services
or
labor
be
temporary.
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
service
and
we
do
agree
with
this
that
if
a
person
comes
to
the
united
states
temporarily
but
to
carry
out
permanent
services
or
labor,
he
is
not
a
non-immigrant.
so
a
daily
commuter
who
comes
across
the
border
daily
and
that
his
visit
is
temporary
but
he,
if
he
works
in
an
automobile
plant
on
a
permanent
basis,
he's
not
a
non-immigrant.
i
think,
we
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
you
come
many
times
temporarily
but
the
job
is
a
permanent
one
your
honor.
that
is
the
service's
interpretation
of
that
phrase
to
and
we
do
agree
with
it.
now
what
the
service
says,
however,
is
that's
not
the
end
of
the
definition.
that
the
end
of
the
definition
is,
if
unemployed
person
is
capable
of
performing
such
service
or
labor,
cannot
be
found
in
this
country.
now,
we
submit
that
isn't
part
of
the
definition.
that
the
definition
is
the
description
of
the
people
themselves
and
not
the
rule
which
is
clearly
--
which
is
really
an
analogous
to
the
rule
for
immigrants
which
is
in
section
212
(a)
(14),
which
says
to
an
immigrant
that
if
you
can't
get
a
department
of
labor
certification,
you
can't
come
in
to
this
country.
this
is
the
analogous
provision
for
non-immigrants.
if
the
service's
position
were
correct,
it
would
mean
that
different
kinds
of
people
coming
for
in
the
same
way,
same
temporary
basis,
some
of
them
could
come
in
as
non-immigrants.
some
of
them
would
be
non-immigrants,
some
of
them
would
not
be
non-immigrants,
purely
depending
on
the
kind
of
occupation
that
was
involved
and
even
the
time
a
year,
there
would
be
no
in
effect
--
in
effect
there
would
be
no
general
classification
of
non-immigrants.
and
we
submit
that
the
definition
is
the
beginning
of
this
phrase,
the
latter
is
the
condition
upon
which
you
can
enter.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think,
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think,
that's
really
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
the
reason
the
third
is
--
i
think,
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
third
is
like
all
other
daily
commuters
allowed
to
keep
coming
into
the
united
states.
the
third
category
that
your
honor
stated
correctly
is
part
of
the
daily
commuter
category.
there
are
no
seasonal
commuters
that
come
--
by
definition,
a
seasonal
commuter
isn't
--
can't
be
permanent.
and
so
it's
part
of
the
dailies.
we
have
never
litigated
anybody,
of
course,
but
the
agricultural
workers.
and
so
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
i
think,
it's
really
fair
to
say
it's
outside
the
litigation.
now,
i
don't
want
to,
however,
ignore
it
such
that
an
effect,
i
say
that
don't
think
about
it
as
--
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
no
your
honor.
let
me
tell
you
--
let
me
explain
what
happened
on
it.
the
court
of
appeals
only
dealt
with
these
first
two
categories,
seasonal
and
dailies.
we
then
said,
we
thought,
based
on
their
wording
in
describing
dailies,
we
thought
that
what
--
the
way
they
described
dailies
that
they
meant
the
dailies
who
have
permanent
jobs
can
continue
to
enter
the
united
states,
but
they
didn't
meant
to
allow
dailies
who
were
agricultural
workers
to
do
so,
and
we
asked
for
clarification
in
a
motion
after
the
judgment.
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
give
clarification
and
said
that
it
had
given
--
it
had
explained
itself
enough
and
that
the
district
court
could
deal
with
that
question
on
remand
on
the
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
mr.
bruce
j.
terris
well,
i
rather
not
categorize
that
your
honor.
thank
you.
