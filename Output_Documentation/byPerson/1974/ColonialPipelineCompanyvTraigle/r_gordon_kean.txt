mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
gordon
kean.
i
represent
colonial
pipeline
company
here
on
appeal
from
the
decision
of
louisiana
supreme
court.
this
case
presents
i
think
for
a
decision
the
question
of
just
how
far
the
states
may
go
in
fractionalizing
the
doing
business
concept
in
an
effort
to
levy
an
excise
tax
on
a
purely
interstate
business
before
reaching
out
the
limits
permitted
by
the
commerce
clause.
this
is
the
first
time
this
court
had
addressed
itself
to
this
specific
question
as
i
appreciate
it
since
1964
when
the
court
decided
the
general
motors
case
by
a
divided
court.
and
thereon,
there
had
been
several
state
court
decisions
which
i've
related
to
the
question
as
to
which
this
court
declined
to
accept
jurisdiction.
another
consequence
of
those
actions
by
this
court
in
declining
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court
cases,
it
raised
the
issue.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
commented
in
passing
upon
the
question
that
there
had
been
a
serious
inroad
in
the
traditional
immunity
of
purely
interstate
business
operations.
for
this
reason,
i
think
the,
the
court
here
because
of
the
facts
and
the
background
of
the
louisiana
law
that
i
shall
detail
to
the
court,
had
a
unique
opportunity
to
again
declare
where
the
line
is
to
drawn.
the
facts
as
i
outline
them
in
the
law
under
which
this
case
occur
i
think
placed
the
issue
in
rather
sharp
focus,
so
that
the
court
is
in
a
position
to
decide
whether
or
not
and
how
far
the
states
may
go
in
fractionalizing
the
business
concept
as
a
basis
for
the
tax.
the
colonial
pipeline
is
a
delaware
corporation.
it
operates
in
interstate
commerce,
transporting
for
others
as
a
common
carrier
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
refined
petroleum
products
for
others.
under
these
circumstances,
this
is
not
a
case
such
as
that
before
the
court
in
general
motors
which
was
the
last
time
this
issue
was
before
the
court
because
colonial
does
not
own
and
does
not
deliver
in
the
state
of
louisiana
any
of
the
products
which
it
transports
through
its
line.
neither
is
this
an
in
lieu
tax
case
such
as
this
court
used
as
a
basis
for
distinguishing
the
virginia
franchise
tax
which
was
before
the
court
in
the
second
railway
express
case
from
virginia.
this
tax
is
levied
by
the
very
expressed
language
of
the
louisiana
statute
in
addition
to
all
other
taxes
which
have
paid
by
colonial
pipeline
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
as
i
indicated,
colonial
is
an
interstate
county
--
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
colonial
passed
a
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
property
tax
on
its
facilities
which
are
located
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
it
pays
an
apportioned
income
tax
based
upon
income
derived
from
its
operations
in
that
state.
it
pays
the
sales
and
use
tax
in
connection
with
such
operations
as
it
conducts
in
the
state
it
pays
all
of
that
range
of
taxes
that
just
as
any
other
operator
in
the
state
would
pay.
our
position
is
that
with
respect
to
the
franchise
tax
that
there
is
nothing
which
louisiana
gives
to
colonial
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
levy
that
tax.
our
position
is
that
colonial
is
operating
in
interstate
commerce
as
a
corporation
and
under
the
constitution
and
statutes
of
the
united
states
it
hasn't
derived
the
right
to
operate
in
interstate
commerce
and
therefore,
louisiana
gives
to
--
gives
to
colonial
with
respect
to
the
privilege
of
franchise
tax
nothing
for
which
it
could
demand
compensation.
we
do
not
contend
them
that
colonial
on
a
traditional
case
is
decided
by
this
case
does
not
owe
the
property
tax,
that
it
does
not
owe
the
income
tax,
or
the
sales
and
use
tax
although
which
this
court
is
clearly
recognized
that
the
interstate
carrier
must
be
responsible
for
it.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
no
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
if
they
increase
the
rates
of
the
corporation
income
tax,
they
got
to
increase
those
rates
across
the
board.
certainly,
they
couldn't
single
out
the
interstate
commerce
as
a
basis
for
a
differential
in
income
tax
payment
in
the
state
of
louisiana
what
it
would
otherwise
establish
for
other
companies
operating
in
that
state.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
as
i
view
it,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
colonial
pays
the
property
tax
for
which
it
has
the
right
to
and
to
get
police
protection
for
protection
in
the
other
protection
that
a
state
would
afford
on
to
those
circumstances.
colonial
as
an
interstate
carrier
as
i
see
it,
if
it
is
compelled
to
pay
the
louisiana
privileged
tax
for
no
right
which
louisiana
itself
gives
to
colonial.
then
under
those
circumstances,
we
have
a
tax
on
interstate
commerce
which
i
say
to
the
court
is
prohibited
by
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
if
is
permitted
then
under
the
circumstances,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
states
can
then
control
the
question
of
interstate
commerce
against
their
principle
that
the
commerce
clause
was
created
for.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
well,
they
could
perhaps
increase
the
income
tax
across
the
board
so
if
all
the
corporations
in
the
state
of
louisiana
pay
an
increased
income
tax
and
under
those
circumstances,
it
may
well
be
that
they
would
accomplish
otherwise
the
same
result.
but
i
say
to
the
court
again
that
where
this
tax
is
levied
on
the
privilege
upon
doing
business
in
corporate
form
as
the
louisiana
supreme
court
construed
it
to
be,
then
that
gets
to
the
authority
and
right
of
the
corporation
to
exist
and
under
those
circumstances,
if
that
corporation
is
engaged
in
interstate
commerce,
solely
in
interstate
commerce.
and
it's
our
view
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
the
power
of
taxation
on
the
privilege
or
the
right
to
do
business
in
corporate
form
to
in
effect
destroy
the
state
commerce.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
that's
correct.
my
position
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
the
privilege
or
the
tax
upon
the
right
to
do
business
in
corporate
form
as
the
louisiana
court
construed
this
tax
to
be
imposed
on
is
a
right
which
colonial
engaging
as
it
does
in
interstate
commerce
derives
from
the
federal
constitution
and
therefore
louisiana
gives
to
colonial
nothing
for
which
they
could
expect
recompense
in
so
far
as
the
privilege
tax
is
concerned.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
for
the
simple
reason
that
this
court
has
held
in
the
prior
cases
that
are
fairly
apportioned
income
tax
is
that
it
can
be
levied
against
an
interstate
carrier
because
it's
on
the
income
as
distinguished
from
the
right
to
carry
on
the
interstate
business.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
make
no
claim
with
unfair
apportionment
except
for
this
laid,
our
claim
on
the
basis
that
privilege
tax
or
the
franchise
tax
as
imposed
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
interpreted
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
is
laid
upon
the
privilege
and
under
the
circumstance
violates
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it's
on
the
usual
apportionment
basis
of
--
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
we
are
doing
business.
we
have
a
pipeline
system
of
268
miles
out
some
3500
miles
of
system
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
we
qualify
in
louisiana
to
do
intrastate
business.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
as
long
as
that
business
was
a
purely
intrastate
business
because
under
those
circumstances,
you
give
to
the
state
the
right
to
deny
interstate
business
within
its
borders
based
upon
the
payment
of
some
fee.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
--
we
--
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
we
operate
a
pipeline
system
in
louisiana.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
we
asked
nothing
from
louisiana
with
respect
to
the
right
to
carry
on
--
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
the
right
to
carry
on
the
interstate
business
because
our
position
is
under
decided
cases
of
this
court
that
the
right
to
carry
on
a
purely
intrastate
business
is
derived
from
the
constitution
and
therefore
there's
nothing
for
us
to
pay
louisiana
in
the
way
of
the
privilege
tax
to
carry
on
that
business.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
well,
as
i
appreciate
the
difference
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
the
distinction
made
by
the
court
in
the
northwestern
state's
case.
here
is
that
they
were
dealing
there
was
an
income
tax
and
the
court
there
taking
the
position
somewhat
as
the
court
has
done
in
the
case
of
the
property
tax
that
this
was
not
a
tax
on
interstate
commerce.
it
was
a
tax
on
income
and
if
that
income
tax
was
fairly
apportioned,
so
you
didn't
have
a
multiplicity
of
the
same
kind
of
tax.
so
as
to
burden
interstate
commerce
than
under
the
circumstances
that
that
was
a
constitutionally
acceptable
tax.
now,
we're
here
dealing
and
i'll
go
back
again
if
i
may.
let
me
try
to
give
a
little
bit
of
the
background
of
colonial's
operations
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
they
operate
--
colonial
operates
a
pipeline
system
they
say
transporting
refined
petroleum
products
for
others
of
some
3,500
miles
of
pipeline
all
the
way
from
houston,
texas
to
the
new
york,
calberry.
some
258
miles
of
that
pipeline
traverse
the
state
of
louisiana.
the
collector
admits
and
the
louisiana
courts
found
that
everything
that
colonial
was
doing
in
the
state
of
louisiana
was
related
to
an
integral
part
of
its
interstate
movement
of
these
profits.
colonial
does
know
intrastate
business
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
everything
it
does
is
related
to
interstate
movement
of
its
products
and
under
the
circumstances,
there
are
no
local
activities
as
we
view
them.
in
the
state
of
louisiana
upon
which
louisiana
may
lay
the
privilege
tax,
that
is
local
activity
sufficiently
separate
from
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce
to
permit
that
tax.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
they
pick
up
oil
from
a
city
service
refinery
in
lake
charles,
louisiana
and
they
transport
that
further
to
the
east
outside
the
state.
they
delivery
refined
products
to
a
station
in
baton
rouge
from
a
refinery
in
texas
but
there
are
no
movements
of
its
products
from
a
point
in
louisiana
to
another
point
in
louisiana.
all
of
the
movements
of
its
products
are
how
will
they
may
come,
either
come
out
in
the
state
into
louisiana
or
from
louisiana
out
of
the
state
and
in
the
majority
of
the
instances
is
primarily
a
matter
of
simply
moving
the
oil
or
refined
petroleum
products
through
the
pipeline
that
travels
to
the
state
of
louisiana.
so
i
say
to
the
court
that
there
are
no
local
activities
separate
from
the
interstate
movement
in
louisiana
and
under
the
circumstances,
if
we
hold
that
this
tax
can
be
validly
levied
upon
colonial.
and
i
say
to
the
court,
contrary
to
prior
decisions
of
this
court
in
cases
such
as
spector
motors
that
we
have
now
granted
the
state
the
authority
to
levy
a
tax
upon
the
privilege
of
doing
purely
interstate
business
contrary
to
what
i
believe
where
the
concept
behind
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
now,
let
me
make
several
further
points
with
respect
to
the
facts
so
that
the
court
will
appreciate
and
i'm
quoting
the
background
of
the
statute,
the
louisiana
statute
puts
this
matter
in
sharp
focus.
prior
to
1970,
the
louisiana
tax
was
interpreted
as
being
imposed
upon
the
privilege
of
doing
business
and
the
same
colonial
pipeline
company
litigated
in
the
louisiana
court
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
tax
so
imposed
violated
the
commerce
clause
in
united
states
constitution
and
the
louisiana
courts
held
citing
the
spector
motor
case
that
the
tax
as
applied
to
this
purely
intrastate
operation
violated
the
commerce
clause
and
the
louisiana
courts
ordered
a
refund
of
the
taxes
which
colonial
had
paid
in
the
protest
in
connection
with
the
levy
of
the
privilege
statute.
louisiana
in
1970,
made
some
revisions
in
the
franchise
tax
so
as
to
include
what
they
call
alternating
incidents
or
alternative
incidents.
which
in
reality
were
nothing
more
than
a
restatement
of
what
constituted
doing
business
and
the
tax
was
paid
under
protest
again
and
colonial
took
the
position
that
there
had
been
no
substantive
change
in
the
operating
incidents
of
the
tax
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
first
colonial
case
which
have
been
decided
by
the
louisiana
court
was
dispositive
of
the
issue.
the
louisiana
district
court
and
the
louisiana
court
of
appeals
agreed
and
when
the
case
went
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court
under
writs,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
took
the
position
that
in
reality
there
was
no
substantive
change
in
the
statute
that
the
tax
even
before
the
1970
was
not
imposed
upon
the
privilege
of
doing
business
but
was
imposed
upon
the
doing
of
business
in
corporate
form
and
then
took
the
position
that
that
doing
of
business
in
corporate
form
was
a
local
activity
upon
which
louisiana
could
impose,
place,
levy
this
franchise
tax
without
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
i
believe
that
this
court
will
read
the
statute
before
1970
and
after
1970,
it
will
come
to
the
conclusion
as
did
the
lower
courts
in
louisiana
and
in
fact
the
louisiana
supreme
court
that
there
was
no
change
in
the
operating
incidence
of
the
tax
because
doing
business
in
corporate
form
was
a
manner
in
which
you
carried
out
this
interstate
business
of
colonial
and
under
the
circumstances,
the
cases
were
parallel
cases
and
should
have
reached
the
similar
result.
now,
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
distinction.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
more
threat
to
the
commerce
clause
by
saying
that
you
can
impose
the
tax
upon
the
--
on
doing
interstate
business
in
corporate
form
than
otherwise
because
that
is
the
traditional
method
in
which
interstate
business
is
conducted.
and
under
the
circumstances,
it
appears
to
us
that
the
case
is
in
the
same
posture
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
first
case
but
if
we
accept
it
as
having
some
distinction
by
reason
of
the
1970
amendment,
i
still
say
to
the
court
that
this
is
a
tax
upon
interstate
commerce
which
this
court
has
recognized
that
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
states
with
respect
to
the
--
with
respect
to
the
commerce
clause
and
under
the
certain
statute
that
louisiana
supreme
court
ought
to
be
reversed.
now,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
that
the
operating
incidents
of
the
tax
was
and
i
quote,
?the
local
incidents
tax
is
a
form
of
doing
business
rather
than
the
business
done
by
that
corporation
and
they
emphasized
it
by
saying
that
the
thrust
of
the
statute
is
the
tax
of
doing
business
in
louisiana
in
corporate
form
and
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
distinction
that
makes
the
difference
between
a
tax
upon
a
privilege
of
doing
business
and
the
tax
which
imposes
it
upon
the
doing
of
business
in
corporate
form.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
that
are
operating
in
louisiana?
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
i
don't
know
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
know.
i've
never
explored
that
question
with
the
collective
revenue.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
well,
it
would
depend
i
think
on
whether
or
not
the
court
could
find
from
activities
that
the
airline
was
conducting
in
the
state
of
louisiana
that
they
were
indeed
engaged
in
local
activities
separate
from
that
interstate
operation
which
might
then
form
the
basis
of
the
tax.
for
example,
if
that
airline
was
bringing
materials
into
baton
rouge,
where
it
can
maintain
that
warehouse
and
was
there
storing
those
materials
for
some
peak
of
the
time
before
it
was
delivered
to
its
customers,
then
i
would
say
that
that
constitutes
an
intrastate
activity
unrelated
and
unnecessary
to
carrying
on
the
interstate
business
as
they
are
and
under
the
circumstances,
the
state
of
louisiana
would
well
have
a
basis
for
levying
the
tax
upon
the
privilege
of
doing
business
based
upon
the
imposition
of
it
upon
the
local
activity
being
conducted
by
that
company,
but
where
the
sole
and
only
activity
done
by
the
company
in
the
state
of
louisiana
is
that
which
relates
to
interstate
commerce.
i
say
to
the
court
that
you
have
to
come
to
a
different
conclusion,
otherwise,
the
states
then
have
the
right
to
determine
whether
or
not
corporations
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
can
truly
exist
in
the
state's
in
which
they
operate.
i
think
if
the
court
--
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
well,
this
court
held
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
spector
motors
which
was
dealing
with
the
transportation
operation.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
no,
i
don't
feel
that
interstate
commerce
is
protected
by
apportionment
of
--
by
apportionment
of
a
privilege
tax
because
the
tax
there
is
laid
upon
interstate
commerce
and
no
manner
of
apportionment
can
deny
that
fact.
and
in
spector
for
example,
this
court
squarely
said
that
the
fact
that
the
tax
was
fairly
apportioned
did
not
save
the
tax.
and
i
think
it's
logical
and
reasonable
that
that
should
be
the
case
because
even
if
you
--
even
if
you
apportion
it
fairly.
nonetheless,
you'll
be
on
a
position
as
i
see
it
for
the
state
to
say,
we
give
you
the
right
to
come
into
the
state
under
these
circumstances.
we
lay
down
the
conditions
under
which
interstate
commerce
will
be
carried
through
the
state
of
louisiana
and
by
that
means
are
vested
in
the
state
the
right
to
control
and
decide
the
matter
on
which
interstate
commerce
can
be
conducted
among
the
states
contrary
to
the
principle
if
the
commerce
clause
was
established
to
achieve.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
as
my
recollection,
it
did.
yes.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
--
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
that's
what
an
apportioned
income
tax.
and
my
point
is
--
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
if
you
read
--
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
no
sir,
i'm
not,
because
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago,
northwestern
states
was
dealing
with
an
income
tax.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
may
well
be
that
some
states
do.
in
some
states
measure
their
franchise
tax
by
income,
for
example
in
general
motors,
there
was
a
franchise
tax
measured
by
growth
receipts
and
i
think
perhaps
and
i
think
perhaps
in
the
spector
case,
there
was
a
franchise
tax
measured
by
income.
but
however
it's
measured
under
whatever
circumstances,
it
has
been
stated
to
be
imposed
upon
if
it
was
a
tax
on
interstate
commerce,
directly
as
distinguished
from
a
tax
on
income
which
this
court
held
in
northwestern
case,
you
kind
of
pull
out
here
and
therefore
it's
not
a
tax
on
the
commerce
itself.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
well,
i
must
say
it,
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
in
all
of
the
cases
which
you
dealt
with
the
problem,
the
decisions
have
been
by
a
sharply
divided
court.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
memphis
gas
versus
stone
case,
it
was
not
even
a
majority
opinion
as
the
court
may
recall.
it
was
a
--
i
think
a
four,
two
of
three
decision.
anyway,
it
was
not
a
five
members
of
the
court
who
actually
wrote
the
majority
opinion.
so,
i
say
to
the
court
that
this
case
as
i
see
it
with
the
facts
where
we
have
no
dispute
whatsoever
as
to
the
interstate
character
of
this
common
carrier
pipeline.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
i
don't
share
your
view
mr.
justice
blackmun
that
it
is
a
thin
one.
i
think
there
are
a
lot
of
narrow
constructions
that
you
defined
in
this
field.
but
i
can
see
in
my
own
mind
the
great
distinction
between
a
fair
labor
portion
income
tax,
while
that
the
tax
is
upon
the
income
as
distinguished
from
a
tax
upon
the
privilege
of
doing
interstate
business,
where
the
tax
is
imposed
and
levied
upon
the
interstate
business
itself.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
even
though
measured
by
income.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it
makes
sense
in
this
sense
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
court
recognizes
the
right
of
the
states
to
levy
a
tax
upon
the
privilege
of
doing
purely
interstate
business.
however
that
is
measured,
whatever
it
may
be
imposed
upon
and
this
court
has
made
the
breakthrough
which
permits
the
states
in
my
opinion
to
regulate
interstate
commerce
contrary
to
the
theory
and
purposed
of
the
commerce
clause.
may
i
save
a
few
minutes
please.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
gordon
kean,
jr.
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court?
i'd
like
to
make
several
comments
and
one
has
to
do
with
the
argument
of
counsel
concerning
the
fact
that
colonial
qualified
to
do
business
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
he
seems
to
place
great
emphasis
on
that
fact
even
though
the
louisiana
supreme
court
did
not.
the
fact
is
and
if
the
court
will
look
at
exhibit
b
6
in
the
appendix,
you'll
find
that
colonial
qualified
to
do
intrastate
business
in
the
state
of
louisiana
and
if
this
court
will
review
the
case
of
ozark
pipeline
corporation
versus
monier,
which
is
a
266
u.s.
the
court
will
find
there
the
question
being
weighed
concerning
the
qualification
of
an
interstate
carrier
in
the
state
at
issue
there
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
a
question
of
qualification.
but
a
question
of
what
is
done
pursuant
to
that
qualification
and
where
in
the
monier
case,
nothing
had
done
other
than
interstate
commerce,
the
court
held
that
the
mere
qualification
had
no
bearing
nor
created
any
right
in
the
state
to
impose
a
tax.
