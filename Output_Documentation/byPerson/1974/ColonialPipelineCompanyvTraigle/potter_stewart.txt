that
was
before
an
income
tax,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
an
unapportioned
franchise
tax.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
have
to
take
--
impose
a
tax
on
a
privilege
of
doing
this
business
in
a
non-corporate
form
and
have
then
complemented
tax?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
--
we're
talking
about
constitutional
power.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
read
it,
i
know
that
this
tax
is
imposed
on
corporations
and
you
justified
by
saying
that
at
least
arguendo
that
the
beyond
the
power
of
louisiana
is
to
tax
that
business
as
a
business
since
it's
purely
interstate.
but
the
state
said
this
is
valid
because
louisiana
is
taxing
it
because
it's
in
corporate
form.
and
i'm
asking
you
if
louisiana
would
have
the
constitutional
power
to
conduct
this
business
because
the
incidence
of
it
was
that
it
was
conducted
in
non-corporate
form?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
nothing
left
of
the
interstate
immunity,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
state
tax
--
if
the
state
can
tax
a
purely
interstate
business
by
way
of
a
franchise
tax
on
the
basis
of
the
form
on
which
it's
conducted,
whether
it
be
corporate
on
non-corporate
and
there's
nothing
left
to
the
exemption,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
true.
that
would
be
true
of
an
individual
proprietorship
for
running
this
pipeline,
wouldn't
it?
it
presumed
they
receive
the
police
and
fire
protection
and
the
other
protection
that
the
state
gives.
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
are
these
benefits?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
isn't
a
louisiana
corporation.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
may
they
take
their
place
specifically
expressed
the
congressional
intent
to
make
the
incidents
of
the
taxation
the
privilege
of
doing
this
business
as
an
individual
proprietorship.
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
answer
my
brother
blackmun's
question?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
yeah.
it's
really
the
same
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
mentioned
fire
protection.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
--
conferred
by
delaware
whether
new
jersey
or
wherever
this
place
is
incorporated?
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
get
that
free
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
did
they
get
that
free
or
to
that
to
pay
a
fee,
filing
fee?
justice
potter
stewart
they
probably
did,
so
when
can't
the
state
--
justice
potter
stewart
tax
about
--
