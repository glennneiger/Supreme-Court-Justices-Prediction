mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sole
issue
presented
to
this
court
by
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
operating
incidences
of
the
louisiana
corporation
franchise
tax
are
sufficient
basis
to
support
the
constitutional
application
of
the
tax
upon
colonial.
i
think
that
i'd
like
to
point
out
a
few
pertinent
sections
of
the
statute
before
i
go
on
through.
it's
on
page
five
of
my
brief.
page

of
my
brief.
louisiana
revised
statute
47-601
which
it
imposes
the
tax
to
states,
imposition
of
the
tax,
?
every
domestic
corporation
and
every
foreign
corporation
exercising
its
charter
are
qualified
to
do
business
or
actually
doing
business
in
the
state
are
owning
or
using
any
port
or
all
this
capital
plant
or
any
property
in
the
state
subject
to
the
decline
with
other
provisions
of
law
shall
pay
an
annual
tax.?
i'll
skip
down
to
the
incidences
of
the
tax.
the
tax
levied
herein
is
due
and
payable
on
anyone
are
all
of
the
following
alternative
incidences:
the
qualification
to
carry
on
or
to
do
businesses
of
the
state
or
the
actually
doing
business
in
the
state
in
the
corporate
form.?
the
statute
defines
doing
business.
the
term
doing
business
as
used
herein
shall
mean
and
include
each
and
every
act,
power,
right,
privilege
or
immunity
exercised
in
the
state
as
an
incident
to
or
by
virtue
of
the
powers
and
privileges
acquired
by
the
nature
of
such
organizations
as
well
the
buying,
selling,
procuring
of
services
or
property.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that
is
the
heart
of
this
case
today.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
the
louisiana
supreme
court
recognized
that
the
state
may
not
and
the
state
has
not
attempted
here
to
impose
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
interstate
business
in
louisiana.
what
the
state
is
attempting
and
what
they
have
taxed
is
the
corporation
that
has,
which
is
on
page
26
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
has
qualified
to
do
business
in
louisiana.
in
1962,
when
colonial
first
came
into
the
state
and
begin
laying
its
pipeline,
it
did
quality
with
the
secretary
of
state
to
do
business
in
louisiana.
they
have
received
a
qualification
from
the
secretary
of
the
state
that
authorized
them
to
do
anything
and
everything
to
the
domestic
corporation
that
another
domestic
corporation
has
an
authority
to
do,
only
limited
by
their
own
articles
in
incorporation.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
legislative
intent
was
put
into
the
statute
so
there
would
be
ambiguity
about
what
the
purpose
of
the
tax
is.
there'd
be
any
purpose
of
the
section
to
require
the
payment
of
this
tax
to
the
state
of
louisiana
by
domestic
corporations
for
the
right
granted
by
the
laws
of
the
state
to
exist
as
such,
a
corporation
or
organization
rather.
and
by
both
domestic
and
foreign
corporations
for
the
enjoinment
under
the
protection
of
the
laws
of
the
state
of
the
powers,
rights,
privileges,
immunities
derived
by
reason
of
the
corporate
form
in
existence
and
corporation.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
no,
sir.
that's
not
correct.
the
revised
section
47:606.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that's
set
out
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief
on
page
45.
i
would
like
to
add
that
colonial
is
not
complaining
about
the
apportionment
formula
or
the
measurement
of
the
tax.
what
they
have
complained
of
the
imposition
of
the
tax
at
all.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
i'll
have
to
go
over
that.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
tax
in
the
privilege
of
doing
interstate
business
and
the
tax
imposed
in
this
case?
it's
very
simple.
the
state
is
not
taxing
the
business
of
transporting
natural
gas
to
the
state.
the
tax
is
not
levied
on
that
business.
the
tax
is
levied
on
a
corporation
which
is
voluntarily
coming
into
the
state
and
qualified
with
the
secretary
of
the
state
to
do
business
in
the
state.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
the
tax
is
only
imposed
upon
corporations.
it's
not
imposed
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
yes.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
if
the
state
granted
to
the
partnership
or
whatever
other
type
of
association
it
was
benefits,
local
benefits
upon
which
he
can
levy
the
tax,
yes.
it
does
do
this
to
corporations
that
qualify
with
the
secretary
of
state.
they
do
have
benefits
of
the
normal
benefits
of
any
domestic
corporation
would
derive
from
the
state.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
the
interstate
immunity
still
exists
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
i
agree
with
your
statement,
except
for
the
one
point.
the
state
here
does
not
do
that
and
there's
not
an
attempt
to
do
that.
colonial
pipeline
came
to
louisiana
and
qualified
voluntarily
for
whatever
reason
to
do
business
in
louisiana
and
the
extent
of
their
use
of
that
authority
is
their
own
business.
the
state
is
taxing
the
corporation
because
it's
qualified
and
because
as
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
held,
they
received
protection
of
the
lawful
activities
which
they
conduct
in
the
state
which
as
in
the
case
of
memphis
natural
gas.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that
is
true.
he
would
receive
those
protections
but
he
would
not
receive
all
the
corporate
benefits
which
corporations
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
as
pointed
out
by
louisiana
supreme
court.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
no,
sir.
they
--
but
they
have
qualified
to
do
business
in
the
state.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
yes,
they
could.
the
state
did
not
require
them
to
do
so.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
yes.
now,
mr.
kean
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
we
do
have
such
a
statute.
however,
the
corporations
doing
exclusively
interstate
business
are
excluded
from
the
provisions
of
that
statute.
and
i
point
that
out
in
my
brief
as
also
have
been
the
state
supreme
court
holding
that
has
--
that's
upheld
that
statute
in
the
same
as
the
instruction
of
the
statute.
now,
appellant
has
pointed
out
several
cases
attempting
to
argue
that
the
tax
imposed
by
the
statute
is
a
license
tax
as
a
conditioned
precedent
for
doing
business
in
louisiana
and
several
--
the
several
cases
pointed
out
by
appellant
brought
up
that
issue
that
you
just
asked.
these
cases
were
cited
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court
when
it
held
that
the
requirement
that
the
state
qualify,
i
mean,
the
corporation
qualify
in
the
state
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
the
courts
of
the
state
only
apply
to
corporations
doing
intrastate
business.
it
did
not
apply
corporation
doing
exclusively
interstate
business.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
yes,
i
did
answer
that.
they
would
if
they
gave
to
the
individual
--
to
the
partnership,
benefits,
local
benefits
emanating
from
the
state
of
louisiana,
emanating
from
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
well,
could
they
tax
him?
i
don't
know
of
any
benefits
that
they
are
passing
to
him.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
well,
he
would
have
the
right
to
receive
the
same
police
protections
that
colonial
receives
in
this
case.
however,
he
would
not
have
the
right
to
receive
the
corporate
benefits
that
colonial
does.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
i
thought
that
i
did.
my
answer
would
be
only
if
there
were
local
benefits
given
to.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
yes.
i
said,
in
this
case,
in
the
colonial
case,
the
corporation
receives
numerous
benefits
as
the
corporation.
in
addition
to
the
fire
protection,
the
use
of
the
highways,
the
school
system
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
the
tax,
the
power
of
the
state
to
tax
is
only
upon
entities
emanating
from
the
state.
do
you
like
--
for
example,
a
domestic
corporations,
are
former
domestic
corporations
in
louisiana,
where
the
state
will
have
the
power
to
tax
a
domestic
corporation.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
colonial,
voluntarily
came
into
louisiana,
qualify
with
the
secretary
of
the
state,
received
the
certificate
of
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
pardon
me?
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
i
can't
answer
that
question.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
filing
fee.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
it's
the
corporate
--
it's
the
corporation
itself.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
they
do.
they
pay
a
--
they
pay
a
local
property
tax
as
they
go
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that
goes
to
the
local
parishes
for
their
use,
yes.
this
--
the
local
--
the
property
tax
is
not
a
state
tax.
they
are
local
--
they
are
parish
tax.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that's
correct
and
they
do
pay
a
local
property
tax.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
the
state
is
levying
a
tax
on
the
corporation,
on
the
corporate
form
of
existence.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
it
gives
to
the
corporations
the
various
corporate
benefits
they
received
by
virtue
of
being
incorporated.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
the
absence
of
individual
liability.
the
transfer
of
assets
through
the
--
through
stock,
cost
annuity
of
business,
centralization
of
management.
the
normal
corporate
benefits
that
any
corporation
receives.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
it
is
to
the
state's
--
to
the
corporations
which
one
are
domestic
or
two
which
have
qualified
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
pardon
me.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
it
wouldn't
but
the
corporation
has
voluntarily
qualified
in
the
state.
this
is
no
different
from
the
case
in
the
stone
v.
interstate
natural
gas
company
or
really
the
memphis
natural
gas
case
except
in
this
case.
the
corporation
qualified
in
louisiana
to
do
business.
in
memphis
natural
gas
case,
they
do
not
qualify
to
do
business
in
louisiana
--
in
mississippi.
in
the
stone
case,
they
did
qualify.
they
did
only
interstate
business
in
the
stone
case
and
in
the
memphis
natural
gas
case.
in
the
other
cases
cited
by
me
in
our
brief
to
this
court,
each
of
the
higher
state
courts
which
has
considered
the
incident
of
a
tax
as
one
being
imposed
upon
the
corporate
existence
to
corporate
form
has
upheld
the
validity
of
the
state's
power
to
tax
this
incident.
now,
appellant
cites
or
states
that
the
taxing
question
is
the
same
as
equivalent
of,
or
is
an
effective
condition
precedent
to
colonial
doing
interstate
commerce
in
louisiana.
i
would
like
to
point
out
and
i
made
the
statement
before
that
the
state
of
louisiana
did
not
require
colonial
to
come
into
louisiana
and
qualify
as
a
pre-condition
for
them
to
do
in
their
interstate
business.
now,
the
cases
cited
by
mr.
kean
in
support
of
his
decision
are
not
applicable
in
this
case.
each
of
those
cases,
there
was
an
attempt
by
the
state
to
exclude
a
certain
type
of
business
like
the
express
companies
and
one
case,
the
pipeline
company,
and
to
require
them
before
they
did
business
in
the
state,
a
license
in
order
to
be
able
to
do
that
business.
louisiana
has
not
done
that.
louisiana
has
only
taxed
the
corporation
which
has
voluntarily
qualified
in
the
state.
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
to
mr.
justice
blackmun,
louisiana
does
not
require
that
the
corporation
qualify
in
order
to
be
able
to
use
the
course
of
the
of
the
state.
there
was
intimation
to
that
effect
in
the
case
of
graham
manufacturing
company
v.
rolland
and
i
pointed
out
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
so
held.
louisiana
does
have
an
occupational
license
tax
or
license
tax
similar
to
the
cases
that
mr.
kean
cites
in
his
argument.
they
are
imposed
by
other
statutes,
of
title
47,
section
341
through
405.
this
tax,
this
occupational
license
tax,
is
imposed
upon
individuals,
partnerships,
or
corporations
or
anybody
that
comes
in
before
or
does
the
certain
types
of
businesses,
trades
or
professions
conducted
in
louisiana.
it
makes
no
difference
the
type
of
business
that's
done.
it
is
a
precondition
of
doing
that
type
of
business
and
it
only
applies
to
intrastate
business
done.
the
appellant
cites
the
enforcement
provisions
of
the
louisiana
taxing
statute
as
adjoining
with
the
tax
in
question
to
be
an
effective
license
tax
or
condition
precedent
on
doing
business
in
louisiana.
namely,
he
cites
title
47,
section
401.
that
section
only
applies
to
the
occupational
license
tax
imposed
by
sections
not
in
question
before
this
court.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
this
--
the
enforcement
provisions
applied
--
that
the
other
enforcement
provisions
cited
by
him
apply
to
all
state
taxes.
the
constitutionality
of
this
enforcement
provisions
has
not
been
drawing
question
in
the
courts
below
nor
as
colonial
complained
of
the
enforcement
provisions
in
the
courts
below.
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
of
the
facts
about
this
case
as
far
as
the
amount
of
investment
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
its
true
colonial
owns
and
maintains
258
miles
of
pipeline
in
the
state.
they
have
an
investment
there
of
cost
of
$40
million.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
correct.
all
i'm
doing
is
showing
the
extent
and
the
size
of
their
investment
there.
they
are
--
they're
doing
business.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that
is
--
yes,
sir.
they
--
this
is
one-tenth
of
their
total
assets,
capital
assets.
they
also
see
substantial
revenues
that
are
apportioned
to
state.
there
the
tax
--
one
of
the
taxable
years
in
question
are
1970.
colonial
had
growth
receipts
of
$102
million,
a
net
income
of
$25
million,
$2
million
only
which
was
apportioned
to
louisiana.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that's
correct.
in
addition
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
yes,
sir.
there's
no
difference
between
the
interstate
corporation
that
or
colonial
in
this
case
and
to
our
foreign
corporation
and
a
domestic
corporation
that
is
a
louisiana
domicile.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
it
is
the
same
tax.
now,
the
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
they
would
pay
the
corporate
franchise
tax
imposed
by
the
statute
in
question.
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
colonial
when
they
built
their
pipeline
across
the
state
of
louisiana
utilized
the
state's
courts
for
their
appropriation
of
the
--
of
various
properties
and
to
build
their
pipeline.
their
appropriation
powers
came
from
the
state,
the
state
gave
to
the
common
carriers
and
to
petroleum
pipelines
the
right
to
utilize
appropriation
powers
in
the
state
courts
to
build
their
pipeline.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
would
it
be
a
common
carrier?
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
i
would
have
to
look
this
act
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
yes.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
well,
no
sir
because
it
has
not
been
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
okay,
i'll
--
if
we
are
talking
strictly
of
the
power
the
state
to
do
it,
then
yes.
the
state
is
granting
the
individual
powers
that
come
from
state
law
not
from
the
federal
law.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
no.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
no,
there's
none.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that's
correct.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
no,
i'm
not.
i
was
simply
pointing
out
the
extent
of
the
investment
in
the
state
and
the
fact
that
they
had
received
for
example
it
appropriation
benefits
from
the
state
law
from
the
state
and
not
the
federal
government.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that's
correct.
if
--
my
answer
--
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
is
if
the
state
grants
to
the
individual
or
to
a
partnership
or
to
any
type
of
association
benefits
that
emanate
from
the
state
and
not
from
the
federal
government
then
it's
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
tax
that
benefit.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
they
would
not
levy
this
tax
and
the
state
is
not
attempting
to
levy
this
tax
on
the
individual.
it
is
in
fact
a
corporation
tax.
it
is
imposed
only
on
corporations
for
the
privilege
of
existing
in
corporate
form.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
i
attempted
and
i'll
attempt
to
do
it
again
and
that
is
this.
if
the
state
grants
any
powers,
or
rights,
or
privileges,
or
immunities,
or
benefits
of
any
nature
to
individuals;
that
is
subject
to
the
state's
power
to
grant
to
the
individual
and
is
subject
to
taxation,
yes.
the
state
would
have
power
to
tax
that,
the
state
--
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that
is
what
is
being
taxed.
the
state
seized
upon
the
local
activities
or
local
incidences
that
are
spilled
out
in
this
statute
to
support
that.
the
only
thing
that
is
being
taxed
is
the
corporate
entity.
that
is
correct.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
the
benefits
are
the
normal
corporate
benefits
that
any
other
corporation,
domestic
or
foreign
receives.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
no,
sir.
the
property
tax
in
louisiana
is
a
local
tax
by
the
local
parishes.
it
does
go
for
road
improvements,
fire
protections
and
things
of
that
nature.
it
does
not
pay
for
the
state
police
power
or
the
police
work.
the
state
does
have
a
different
police
set
up
between
the
local
parishes
and
the
state.
they
do
protect
colonial
in
the
state.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that
is
correct.
mr.
whit
m.
cook,
ii
that's
correct.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
case
cited
--
the
case
cited
by
mr.
kean
in
his
argument
in
support
for
the
fact
that
this
tax
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
state
to
tax
is
the
case
of
spector
motor
company
v.
o'connor.
in
that
case,
the
incidence
of
the
tax
was
not
the
corporation
or
the
corporate
form
on
doing
business.
the
incidence
of
the
tax
was
the
doing
of
business
in
that
state.
just
as
our
occupational
license
tax
subjected
by
other
statutes
imposed
a
license
tax
for
doing
a
particular
type
of
business
or
doing
a
particular
type
of
trade
or
profession.
and
i
submit
and
we
submit
that
it
is
a
distinct
difference
between
taxing
the
corporation
for
the
privilege
of
existence
and
enjoyment
of
the
privilege
immunities
in
the
state
in
taxing
a
business
being
done
in
the
state.
that's
all.
