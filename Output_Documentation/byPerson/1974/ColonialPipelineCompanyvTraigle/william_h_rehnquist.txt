what
other
tax
is
archived
by
colonial
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
say
then
in
effect
that
even
though
louisiana
can
and
i
gather
does
impose
the
same
tax
on
domestic
corporations,
it
can
impose
it
on
your
client.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
does
take
oil
out
and
put
oil
in
at
stations
in
louisiana,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you're
protected
to
a
certain
extent
by
the
fact
that
this
tax
applies
equally
to
domestic
corporation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
spector
pretty
much
of
an
anomaly?
i
mean,
it's
really
not
consistent
with
memphis
case
that
went
before
and
it's
really
not
consistent
with
several
cases
that
come
afterwards?
i
don't
think
that
the
cases
which
came
after
make
any
change
in
the
law
so
far
as
spector
is
concerned.
for
example,
the
first
railway
express
case
in
virginia.
the
court
reached
the
same,
identical
conclusion
that
it
reached
in
spector
which
was
the
way
you
had
a
tax
imposed
solely
upon
the
privilege
of
doing
interstate
business
it
would
violate
it
with
the
commerce
clause.
virginia
then
came
back
as
the
court
may
recall
in
the
second
railway
case
and
provided
that
the
tax
was
an
in
lieu
tax.
in
lieu
of
the
ad
valorem
tax
on
intangibles
and
rolling
stock
of
the
way
we
express
agency
and
under
those
circumstances,
this
court
characterized
the
virginia
tax
in
the
second
railway
case
as
being
in
a
nature
of
an
ad
valorem
tax
which
was
acceptable
under
a
long
line
of
decisions
that
this
court
had
rendered.
but
i
know
of
no
case,
i
know
of
no
case
which
has
been
decided
by
this
court
and
spector
the
first
railway
express
case
are
to
the
contrast
which
holds
that
the
states
have
a
right
to
levy
a
franchise
or
privilege
tax
upon
a
business
that's
engaged
exclusively
in
interstate
commerce
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
logic
and
in
good
reason,
that
has
to
be
the
case.
for
example,
in
spector
and
in
the
first
railway
case,
this
court
established
the
rule
which
stated
that
the
commerce
clause
prohibits
a
state
franchise
tax.
the
operating
incidence
of
which
falls
upon
the
privilege
of
carrying
on
exclusively
and
i
emphasize
the
word
exclusively
interstate
transportation
in
and
through
the
state.
now,
there
--
if
we
now
permit
contrary
to
what
spector
holds,
the
states
to
say
that
we
now
have
the
right
to
tax
the
very
business
means
by
which
an
interstate
carrier
operates,
then
it
has
the
right
to
tax
the
existence
of
that
business.
and
it
has
the
right
under
those
circumstances
if
we
grant
to
the
states
the
power
to
tax
that
business,
going
back
over
many
years
of
history
before
this
court,
the
recognition
and
the
power
to
tax
includes
the
power
to
destroy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
protected
by
the
principle
that
a
tax
on
interstate
commerce
can't
discriminate
against
interstate
commerce
and
here,
you
don't
really
claim
any
discrimination.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
measured
by
income.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
make
any
sense
to
you
just
as
a
practical
matter?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
they
haven't
qualified,
they
would
have
run
the
risk
that
in
the
event
of
an
explosion.
the
stockholders
could
be
held
individually
liable
under
louisiana
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
any
individuals
that
you
know
of
in
louisiana
that
have
$40
million
invested
in
a
transcontinental
pipeline?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
referred
to
before
didn't
you
to
the
limited
liability,
not
necessarily
that
the
state
spends
money
to
give
colonial.
but
that
louisiana
recognizes
limited
liability
on
the
part
of
a
corporation
which
is
qualified
to
do
business
in
the
state
and
the
other
incidents
of
corporate
life
that
it
presumably
doesn't
have
to
recognize
but
does
recognize.
that
really
aren't
arguably
taken
up
by
the
property
tax
or
the
income
tax.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
taxing
all
corporations
that
do
business
in
the
louisiana
domestic
or
foreign
for
these
particular
privileges,
isn't
it?
