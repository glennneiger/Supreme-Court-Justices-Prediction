chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1595,
colonial
pipeline
against
traigle.
mr.
kean,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
whether
any
of
the
airlines
are
subject
to
this
tax,
airlines
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
without
making
any
local
stops
except
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
your
view
would
be
that
louisiana
did
not
tax
an
airline
that
was
coming
in
and
landing
merely
at
new
orleans
and
then
picking
up
passengers
and
going
out,
discharging
in
picking
up.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
kean.
mr.
cook.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
they
have
run
the
pipeline
through
without
qualifying?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
i
go
--
if
i
should
go,
i'll
never
have
but
fashioned
go
to
the
mardi
gras
in
new
orleans,
i
get
police
protection
and
fire
protection
so
that
that
incident
alone
isn't
very
much
of
a
basis
for
levying
taxes,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
the
corporate
form.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
they're
paying
property
taxes
on
that,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
you've
taken
care
of
that
with
the
property
tax,
haven't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
income
tax.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
that's
what
every
domestic
corporation
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
put
on
each
of
these
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what's
--
what's
the
counterpart
tax
of
a
domestic
corporation
if
you
spell
that
out
for
me
again?
it
corresponds
to
the
tax
in
question
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
domestic
corporation,
let's
assume
that
you
have
one
that
went
from
baton
rouge
to
new
orleans
if
that
were
feasible,
domestic
entirely.
they
pay
the
income
tax,
they
pay
the
property
tax
and
then
what
else
do
they
pay?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
the
--
if
the
individual
that
was
postulated
by
i
think
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
had
started
this
pipeline
in
texas
and
went
all
the
way
to
the
east
coast,
what
would
be
the
situation
on
--
would
he
be
able
to
condemn
lands?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
a
common
carrier.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
that
might
be
quite
important?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you're
speaking
of
the
power
to
eliminate
domain
is
it
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
you
wouldn't
be
taxing
this
individual
or
would
you?
would
you
be
levying
this
tax
on
that
individual?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that's
not
--
if
i
understood
your
response
correctly,
that's
not
any
different
from
what
it
would
be
if
mr.
h.
l.
hunter
over
in
texas,
had
to
individually
build
a
pipeline
or
had
run
a
truck
line
across?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
thought
you
would
concede
it
that
they
would
not
levy
this
tax
on
the
individual?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
cook.
mr.
kean,
you
have
a
minute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
a
right
doesn't
have
to
be
exercised
necessarily
to
be
valuable,
does
it?
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
interstate
carrier.
if
you
--
the
only
basis
upon
which
you
could
levy
the
tax,
if
it
please
the
court,
is
on
the
basis
of
some
intrastate
activity
and
under
those
circumstances,
if
no
intrastate
activity
is
engaged
in,
it
does
become
important.
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
73-1595,
colonial
pipeline
company
against
traigle
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
brennan.
