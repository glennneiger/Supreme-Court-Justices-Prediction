justice

f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
kean,
as
i
read
the
statute,
there's
no
apportionment
of
any
kind
on
this
tax,
is
that
correct?
i
beg
your
pardon,
i
got
the
wrong
advocate,
mr.
cook,
i'm
sorry.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
page
in
your
brief
is
that
on?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
information,
what's
the
basis
of
the
apportionment,
i've
overlooked
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
if
you
don't
remember
just
go
ahead.
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
you.
