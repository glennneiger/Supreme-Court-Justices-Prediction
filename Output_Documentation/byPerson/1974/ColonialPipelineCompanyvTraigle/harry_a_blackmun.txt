justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
objecting
to
the
imposition
of
the
income
tax
by
louisiana
as
well?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
if
you
prevail
here,
what's
to
prevent
louisiana
from
merely
increasing
the
rates
of
its
income
tax
of
the
same
amount
as
your
franchise
tax?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
put
it
in
another
way
then,
explain
first
the
--
how
that
colonial's
tax
burden
in
louisiana
is
different
from
the
burden
born
by
domestic
corporations?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then,
i
go
back
to
my
other
question,
why
can't
louisiana
accomplish
the
same
thing
by
increasing
the
income
tax
across
the
board
if
you
will?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
why
do
you
concede
then
that
louisiana
can
subject
colonial
to
an
income
tax?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you're
making
no
claim
here
of
unfair
apportionment
of
the
franchise
tax?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
wasn't
that
argument
came
in
northwestern
state's
case
as
was
argued
here
and
rejected
and
i
think
i'm
still
troubled
by
the
distinction
between
the
income
tax
which
you
do
not
contest
because
of
the
northwestern
case
and
this
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
northwestern
states
came
along
after
spector.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
at
least
that
was
some
kind
of
an
incursion
on
spector,
wasn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you're
making
the
same
argument
here
that
was
made
in
northwestern
states.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
exactly
and
some
states
call
an
income
tax
is
a
franchise
tax.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
i'm
not
blaming
you
for
this
argument.
i
think
you're
forced
into
it
by
what
they
regard
as
the
inconsistency
of
our
decision
to
which
memphis,
spector,
northwestern
states.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
indeed
they
have
a
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
we
realized
this
and
there's
not
any
question
about
it
but
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
difference
between
northwestern
states
in
this
case
is
a
very
thin
one
and
this
court
drew
it
but
i
think
it's
a
very
thin
one.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
cook,
for
tax
purposes,
what's
the
difference
between
levying
a
tax
or
what's
the
difference
between
doing
interstate
business
and
doing
interstate
business
in
a
corporate
form?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
let
me
add
that
at
a
second
question.
if
louisiana
can
impose
it
on
doing
business
in
a
corporate
form,
may
it
impose
a
tax
on
doing
interstate
business
in
a
partnership
form
or
in
a
sole
proprietorship
form?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
statute
which
prevents
some
from
going
into
the
state
court
if
they
have
not
qualified,
do
you
have
such
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
have
i
heard
your
answer
to
justice
stewart's
question
which
i
think
followed
mine
as
to
whether
in
your
opinion
louisiana
have
the
power
to
tax
the
doing
of
interstate
business
in
an
individual
where
sole
proprietorship
or
a
partnership
on?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
suppose
colonial
were
owned
mr.
colonial
who
was
an
individual,
could
they
tax
him?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
mr.
justice
stewart's
question.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
really
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
might
have
individuals
that
have
a
substantial
some
invested
in
a
trucking
concern
running
from
texas
to
mississippi.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
i'm
just
wondering
what
your
last
argument.
what
pertinency
it
has
in
view
of
the
fact
that
you
catch
them
for
property
and
income
tax
as
you're
not
boot
strapping
because
--
in
saying
because
this
is
a
substantial
investment
we
tax
them
there,
therefore,
we
can
tax
them
here
also,
are
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
mr.
justice
stewart
said,
"we're
not
talking
about
exactly
what
the
state
has
done
here."
we're
speaking
of
constitutional
power
and
i
wonder
would
you
ever
answer
that
question?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
give
me
an
example
of
this
because
i
detect,
i
think
an
inference
that
the
only
thing
granted
colonial
is
the
right
to
do
business
in
corporate
form,
is
this
what
you're
saying?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
there
any
other
benefits
that
colonial
receives
from
louisiana?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
don't
they
have
a
fire
protection
all
the
rest
to
this
kind
of
thing
and
is
this
answered
by
mr.
justice
marshall's
comment
or
that's
taken
care
of
by
the
property
tax?
