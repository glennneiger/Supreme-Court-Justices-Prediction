well,
rather
of
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
really
held
the
district
court
heard
cannot
exercise
in
its
discretion
accordingly
to
the
make
whole
standard,
when
you
say
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that
so,
i
gather
the
remand
would
be
an
exercise
his
discretion
accordingly
to
make
whole
standard,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
isn't
that
what
the
remand
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
doesn't
the
court
of
appeals
foreclose
an
independent
determination
by
the
district
court
according
to
the
correct
standard
might
whole.
