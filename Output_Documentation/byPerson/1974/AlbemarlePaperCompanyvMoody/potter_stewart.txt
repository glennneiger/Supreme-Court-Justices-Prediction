these
cases
are
here
by
way
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
respondents
who
are
a
certified
class
of
present
and
former
employees
brought
this
action
against
the
petitioners,
their
employer,
the
albemarle
paper
company
and
the
other
petitioner,
the
employee's
union,
seeking
injunctive
relief
against
"any
policy,
practice,
custom
or
usage"
at
the
plant
which
was
violative
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
as
amended
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
of
1972,
and
after
several
years
of
discovery
moved
to
add
a
class
backpay
demand
in
that
lawsuit
--
in
this
lawsuit.
at
the
trial,
the
major
issues
were
the
plant's
seniority
system,
its
program
of
employment
testing,
and
the
question
of
backpay.
the
district
court
found
that,
following
a
reorganization
under
a
new
collective-bargaining
agreement,
the
negro
employees
had
been
"locked'
in
the
lower
paying
job
classifications,"
and
ordered
the
petitioners
to
implement
a
system
of
plantwide
seniority.
the
district
court
refused,
however,
to
order
backpay
for
losses
sustained
by
the
plaintiff
class
under
the
discriminatory
system
on
two
grounds.
first,
that
albemarle,
that
is
the
employer's
breach
of
title
vii
was
not
in
bad
faith.
and
second,
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
respondents
here,
who
had
initially
disclaimed
interest
in
backpay,
had
delayed
making
their
backpay
claim
until
five
years
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
thereby
prejudicing
the
employer
and
the
labor
union.
the
court
also
refused
to
enjoin
or
even
to
limit
albemarle's
testing
program,
which
the
respondents
--
plaintiffs
had
contended
had
a
disproportionate
adverse
impact
on
negros
and
was
not
shown
to
be
related
to
job
performance.
the
court
concluding
that
"personnel
tests
administered
at
the
plant
have
undergone
validation
studies
and
have
proven
to
be
job
related."
the
plaintiffs
--
respondents
here
appealed
on
the
backpay
and
the
pre-employment
tests
issues.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
in
their
favor
and
reversed
the
district
court's
judgment.
today
we
hold
that
given
a
finding
of
unlawful
discrimination,
backpay
should
be
denied
only
for
reasons
that,
if
applied
generally,
would
not
frustrate
the
central
statutory
purpose
manifested
by
congress
in
enacting
title
vii
of
eradicating
discrimination
throughout
the
economy
and
making
persons
whole
for
injuries
suffered
through
past
discrimination.
we
hold
further
that
the
absence
of
bad
faith
is
not
a
sufficient
reason
for
denying
backpay
since
title
vii
is
not
concerned
with
the
employer's
"good
intent
or
absence
of
discriminatory
intent,"
but
rather
"congress
intended
the
thrust
of
the
act
to
be
--
to
the
--
be
the
consequences
of
employment
practices
and
not
simply
the
motivation."
that
as
we
understand
it
is
the
teaching
of
the
case
of
griggs
against
duke
power
company
reported
in
volume
401
of
the
united
states
reports.
whether
the
respondents'
lateness
--
tardiness
and
inconsistency
in
making
their
backpay
demand
in
this
lawsuit
were
excusable
and
whether
they
actually
prejudiced
the
petitioners
by
that
delay
and
inconsistency
are
matters
that
will
be
open
to
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
if
the
district
court,
on
remand,
decides
again
to
decline
a
backpay
award.
as
we
concluded
that
it's
clear
from
the
opinion
in
the
griggs
case
in
401
u.s.
and
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission's
guidelines
for
employees
seeking
to
determine
--
for
employers
rather,
seeking
to
determine
through
professional
validation
studies
whether
employment
tests
are
job
related,
such
tests
are
impermissible
unless
shown,
by
professionally
acceptable
methods,
to
be
"predictive
of
or
significant
--
significantly
correlated
with
important
elements
of
work
behavior
which
comprise
or
are
relevant
to
the
job
or
jobs
for
which
the
applicants
or
candidates
are
being
evaluated."
measured
against
those
standards,
albemarle's
validation
studies
in
this
case
were
materially
defective
in
several
respects
all
of
which
are
described
in
detail
in
the
written
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
but
in
view
of
the
facts
that
during
the
appellate
stages
of
this
litigation
albemarle
has
apparently
been
amending
its
departmental
organization
and
the
use
made
of
its
tests.
and
in
view
further
of
the
fact
that
issues
of
standards
of
proof
for
job
relatedness
and
of
evidentiary
procedures
involving
validation
tests
have
not
until
this
case
been
clarified
and
that
provisional
use
of
tests
pending
new
validation
efforts
may
be
authorized.
the
district
court
on
remand
should
initially
fashion
the
necessary
relief.
and
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
before
us
in
this
case
and
remand
it
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
court's
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
mr.
justice
marshall
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
have
each
filed
separate
concurring
opinions.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
only
in
the
judgment
of
the
court.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an

concurring
in
part
and

and
mr.
