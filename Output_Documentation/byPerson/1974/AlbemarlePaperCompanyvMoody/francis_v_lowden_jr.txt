mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
sir.
there
are
two
broad
issues
for
the
court
testing
and
backpay.
case
74-389
involves
the
employer
petitioners
who
i
refer
to
throughout
my
argument
is
albemarle,
that
case
raises
all
of
the
issues.
case
74-228
involves
the
union
petitioner
and
the
issue
there
is
primarily
backpay.
therefore,
we
have
divided
the
argument
and
it
is
our
intention
if
it
pleases
the
court
to
--
for
me
to
argue
for
15
minutes
on
the
back
payee
one
of
the
testing
issues
and
then
rely
on
mr.
woods'
represents
the
union
to
make
our
argument
in
backpay
and
we
would
hope
to
save
10
minutes
for
a
rebuttal,
particularly
because
we
receive
the
brief
on
thursday
from
solicitor
general
and
we
understand
he
is
going
to
argue
and
we
like
to
have
a
little
time
to
rebut
after
he
gets
through.
the
one
thing
that
it
seems
to
be
agreed
by
everyone
is
that
personnel
tests
are
useful
and
valuable
and
pre-selection
to
vice.
the
congress
has
said
so
i
believe
this
court
has
even
the
guidelines
of
the
elc
it
make
that.
after
that
one
thing
we
depart
company.
i
think
the
real
question
before
the
court
on
the
benefit
of
testing
is
whether
as
a
practical
matter
or
the
way
the
law
has
developed
of
these
tests
can
be
used
at
all.
before
getting
to
the
heart
of
that
however,
let
me
say
about
the
--
a
word
about
the
theory
of
how
test
discriminate.
there
is
some
evidence
that
disadvantaged
people
do
last
well
on
test
then
to
educated
people,
so
the
theory
is
that
if
a
test
screens
out
proportionately
more
of
a
particular
ethnic
group
then
this
case
we're
dealing
with
blacks
and
they're
otherwise
qualified,
it
is
an
unfair
test.
the
key
i
think
is
the
proviso
if
they
are
otherwise
qualified.
so
really
when
you
talk
about
statistics
in
these
cases,
you're
talking
about
a
universe
of
people
who
are
otherwise
qualified
to
do
the
job
you
have.
furthermore,
at
our
mill
in
roanoke
rapids,
we're
going
to
pull
a
normally
employed
people
from
the
roanoke
rapids
area.
in
the
paper
industry,
workers
do
not
go
from
mill
to
mill
quite
far
apart
and
there
is
no
interchange.
so,
if
you
limit
the
universe
to
those
people
and
the
roanoke
rapids
area
who
are
otherwise
qualified,
that
is
the
significance
statistics
in
our
judging,
and
things
like
national
statistics
we
think
are
irrelevant.
now,
as
we
read
the
griggs
case,
it
holds
that
on
issue
to
have
discriminatory
testing
and
the
burden
is
on
the
plaintiffs
to
show
that
the
test
they're
talking
about
has
a
disparate
effect
on
their
particular
group.
no
such
showing
was
ever
made
in
this
case.
in
fact,
i
would
go
so
far,
i
think
i
can
fairly
say
“no
effort
was
made
to
show
that
before
the
district
judge.”
now,
on
appeal
in
the
fourth
circuit
the
issue
came
up
for
the
first
time
in
appellant's
brief,
i
really
believe
it
was
in
the
amicus
brief,
where
they
try
to
show
to
do
some
statistics
they
came
up
for
the
first
time
and
our
test
did
excluded
more
blacks
proportionately
than
it
did
whites.
from
a
--
an
exhibit
in
the
case
which
was
merely
introduced
and
which
we
always
contended
that
is
not
entirely
revocable,
they
extracted
the
following
statistics
that
the
blacks
who
took
albemarle's
test.
the
revised
data
test
average
to
104.20
and
we
required
for
certain
employment
and
certain
lines
of
aggression
not
to
get
a
100.
on
the
two
wonderlic
tests,
wonderlic
a
was
required
and
wonderlic
b,
you
could
take
if
you
didn't
pass,
wonderlic
a,
our
cut
off
score
was
18,
the
blacks
average
17
on
that
test.
at
the
recommendation
of
our
expert
who
tested
at
five
in
this
case
recommended
that
that
be
reduced
to
17
so,
since
1971,
17
has
been
the
cut
off
on
the
wonderlic
a.
we
say
that
these
statistics
do
not
deal
with
a
proper
statistical
universe,
they
are
subject
to
some
doubt
as
to
their
accuracy
and
they
are
introduce
in
the
fourth
circuit
for
the
first
time
and
we
believe
that
there
was
no
substantial
shelling
in
this
case
that
our
test
screen
the
hell
a
disproportionate
number
of
black
people
and
furthermore,
if
the
universe
were
limited
to
qualified
employees
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
any
black
employee
was
never
ever
denied
a
job
for
which
he
was
qualified,
not
a
single
mistake.
and
gentlemen
if
you
would
look
at
page
9
of
our
blue
brief
and
notice
the
little
diagram
in
their
brief,
paper
mill
department,
then
on
the
left
that
a
line
of
progression
for
paper
machine,
i
think
i
can
explain
to
you
why
this
issue
was
so
important
to
my
client
and
we
think
to
many
other
employers
throughout
the
country.
we
have
in
our
mail
--
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
this
blue
brief
sir.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
it
is
the
brief
of
the
employer
petitioner.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
these
two
paper
machines,
modern
machine
in
our
mill
or
about
nearly
twice
as
long
as
a
football
field
--
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
paper
machine.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
paper
machine.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
these
machines
run
it
about
2,000
feet
per
minute,
that's
how
fast
the
paper
is
coming
through.
we
turn
that
a
thousand
tons
a
day
and
these
machines
would
cost
today
$30
or
more
millions
of
dollars
to
replace
just
the
machine.
i
think
the
briefs
now
admit
that
the
paper
machine
line
up
aggression
is
what
is
called
a
functionally
related
line
of
aggression
and
that
means
that
as
you
learn
the
bottom
jobs
bear
hand
number
four.
you
learn
at
the
same
time
the
skills,
and
gain
the
knowledge
and
experience
necessary
for
seventh
hand,
and
then
you
progress
up
that
ladder
by
seniority
and
in
each
case
when
your
seventh
hand,
you
learn
out
to
be
a
sixth
and
so
forth,
until
you
finally
get
to
the
top
job
and
on
the
hill
which
is
the
machine
tender.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
no,
sir.
their
the
mill
works
24
hours
a
day,
seven
days
a
week,
362
days
a
year,
the
shift
rotate
so
you
have
four
shifts,
so
you
have
four
men
in
each
one
of
those
jobs
on
each
of
the
paper
machines.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there's
one
machine
tender
on
each
shift,
on
each
machine.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
yes,
sir.
one
the
seventh
hand,
spare
hands
is
only
used
on
one
of
the
machines.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
yes,
sir.
for
instance,
one
is
running
smoothly,
the
machine
tenders
up
what
they
call
a
“wet
hand
of
the
machine”
and
he
controls
the
speed
of
the
machine,
what
kind
of
paper
you're
--
what's
the
strength
of
the
papers
going
to
be
and
so
forth.
the
back
tender
works
at
the
back
of
the
machine,
he
has
electronic
controls
that
he
can
adjust
if
increase
in
it
and
so
forth.
then
the
other
parts
of
the
crew
run
the
winders,
sweep
the
floors
and
so
forth,
but
the
critical
thing
is
that
if
something
goes
wrong
with
the
paper
and
you
have
a
break
and
all
of
this
wet
stuff
is
--
gets
falling
around
then
they
work
like
a
team,
everybody
cooperates,
they
run
down
the
machine
and
do
various
tests
and
get
that
machine
back
running.
we
figured
out
and
this
is
not
in
the
record
but
it's
mathematically,
if
you
figure
out
at
a
ton
of
papers
worth
$360.00
and
you
have
a
bunch
of
paper
breaks
on
your
machine,
and
you
don't
repair
them
quickly,
you're
going
to
lose
millions
of
dollars
over
course
of
a
the
year
just
simple
arithmetic.
so,
the
great
emphasis
here
is
our
knowledge,
its
on
intelligence,
what
to
do
and
learn
how
to
make
this
tremendous
high
speed
operation
really
perform
efficiently,
productivity
and
you
must
be
on
the
ball
so
you
don't
get
hurt.
it's
so
just
a
quick
look
at
it
i
think
would
convince
anyone
that
the
people
on
it
have
to
be
intelligent
people.
now
here's
our
problem,
you
can't
go
into
the
labor
market
in
roanoke
rapids
and
import
a
machine
tender.
really
i
don't
want
to
have
and
so
forth
down
the
line
it's
possible
to
go
a
100
miles
away
perhaps
and
hire
one
from
some
other
mill
but
the
people
in
this
been
is
--
do
not
interchange
between
mills
they
loose
their
benefits
and
so
forth.
and
it's
very
difficult
and
it
doesn't
happen
at
all
achieved,
employ
experienced
people.
so
our
problem
is,
when
we
hire
a
new
employee
he's
going
to
start
to
act
at
the
bottom
which
he
learn
and
probably
what
he'll
do
when
he
first
comes
out
the
very
meaning
of
tax
but
when
they
hire
these
people
we
got
to
have
people
who
going
up
that
line
eventually
when
we
need
him
are
going
to
be
trained
and
now
have
run
a
paper
machine
and
so
we
think
the
rocket
here
it
says
fully.
when
these
big
machines
were
put
in
the
1950s,
we
found
it
though
that
people
that
we're
employing
just
couldn't
do
the
job
that
we
go
half
way
up
along
and
we'll
reach
their
level
of
confidence
i
believe
that
word
toward
in.
so,
they
tried
to
divide
some
kind
of
way
to
predict
that
a
man
they
hire
is
seventh
hand
when
we
have
to
learn
those
jobs
and
the
personnel
men
that
we
have
it
at
the
time
was
professional
almost
a
phd
and
then
tough
in
psychology
and
he
studied
the
manner
came
up
with
a
revised
data
tasked
and
got
a
correlation
and
they
put
that
in
but
we
think
that
it's
an
absolute
necessary
to
our
operation
not
only
in
that
line
but
in
the
others
that
the
people
who
get
employed
at
the
bottom
have
the
ability
or
apparently
have
the
ability
to
go
to
that
tough
job
because
that's
the
only
place
were
going
to
get
people
to
take
that
job
and
run
on
mill
efficient.
i
saw
that
red
light
come
on
and
it's
suppose
to
be
off.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
well,
i
really
haven't
gotten
then
to
the
argument?
whereas
our
best,
(inaudible)
mr.
woods
take
up
the
other
sub.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
afraid
this
will
be
a
little
disjunctive.
i've
got
it
by
five
points
i
want
to
make
and
there
not
really
connected
but
i'm
--
i'd
like
to
make
him
if
i
possibly
can.
first
of
all
in
the
government's
brief,
they
indicate
that
we
don't
have
any
call
with
there
guidelines
and
that
we
didn't
prove
that
the
guidelines
are,
well,
weren't
unreasonable.
at
the
present
time,
let
me
say
this
first,
the
1966
guidelines
and
the
1970
guidelines
were
published
without
any
public
opportunity
to
comment.
i
would
just
publish
and
put
it
into
effect
whether
the
new
law
they
are
now
having
hearings
on
them.
let
us
set
guidelines
in
which
all
of
the
government
agencies
involved
in
equal
opportunity
will
be
involved
and
they've
had
some
testimony
on
the
guidelines
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
bna
daily
labor
report
for
january
13,
1975
which
is
also
in
our
brief
at
page
36
and
at
the
hearings
on
the
guidelines
the
people
who
testified
and
then
describe
them
as
unworkable,
incomprehensible,
technically
unsound,
too
stringent
beyond
the
state
of
new
york,
ambiguous
yet,
restrictive
unnecessary
impunitive
and
as
one
witness
said
--
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
i
think
that
the
new
guidelines
are
supposed
to
have
relax
the
old
ones
and
so
we
--
they're
talking
about
the
new
proposal
in
which
i
suppose
i
have
relaxed
some
of
the
requirements
of
the
other
guidelines
and
one
witness
of
that
hearing
was
quoted
in
the
bna
as
saying
that
they
are
just
irrational,
unreasonable,
and
impossible.
i
wish
i
had
time
to
point
out
in
detail
why
i
subscribed
to
that
same
view.
i
would
like
to
clear
up
one
other
thing
and
that
is,
what
this
test
supply
to?
this
was
not
--
you
can't
take
a
given
point
in
time
and
say
that's
facts
of
these
cases.
this
is
a
moving
thing,
have
a
new
machinery,
drop
in
various
lines
and
so
forth,
so
that
since
about
the
time
of
the
validation
study
made
by
dr.
taffet
at
that
time.
we
only
use
the
test
in
four
departments,
the
power
plant,
the
big
paper
mill,
the
part
mill,
and
technical
services,
and
you'll
find
if
you
look
in
his
study
that
he
found
validations
in
all
of
those
lines
and
this
been
is
about
isn't
in
13
lines
in
eight
departments,
that's
the
way
it
was
in
1967
but
that
was
not
the
facts
in
1971.
on
the
supervisory
ratings,
what
dr.
taffet
actually
did
was
have
these
people
immediate
supervisors
who
incidentally
have
done
all
these
jobs
because
we
get
our
supervisors
in
the
same
way
up
through
the
ranks.
to
rate
employee
a
against
employee
b
and
the
question
they
answer
which
one
was
better,
tom
or
jack?
and
then
they
go
which
one
is
better,
tom
and
bill?
so,
they
only
--
they
didn't
rate
him
in
an
order
they
just
took
each
one
--
which
one
of
these
two
can
do
the
job
better.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
the
fundamental
question
that
supervisors
answer
everyday
in
a
week.
it's
one
of
the
most
basic
things
that
they're
paid
to
know.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
you
asked
about
the
high
school
education.
in
1965,
the
company
where
the
high
school
education
for
all
incumbents,
so
there
was
no
longer
required
them.
we
continued
then
up
until
the
time
of
trial
and
the
judge
have
knocked
it
out
and
we
did
not
appeal
that.
and
of
course
the
evidence
is
that
we
put
the
test
in
because
the
high
school
education
requirement
didn't
predict
anything.
furthermore,
hasn't
been
said
but
the
injunctive
decree
in
the
district
court,
we
consent
it
to,
that
was
a
really
a
consent
decree.
and
one
other
thing
hadn't
said
and
i
feel
the
court
should
know
that
as
early
as
september
24,
1969
before
those
any
backpay
or
anything
else
in
the
case,
i
asked
the
judge
for
a
trial
and
he
denied
it.
and
one
other
thing
on
backpay,
the
judge
in
effect
has
given
all
these
people
a
trial
on
backpay.
he
ruled
in
the
pretrial
hand
that
backpay
was
an
issue.
he
said
he
would
hear
it,
if
it
got
too
complicated.
he
had
send
to
a
master
but
that
we'll
going
to
start
this
trial
on
monday
morning
and
we're
going
to
go
for
two
weeks,
and
we
didn't
finish
it
or
coming
back.
and
he
wanted
everything
single
thing,
we
wanted
him
to
hear
in
there,
so
when
he
adjourned
that
was
it.
they
have
a
courtroom
full
of
these
employees,
the
testimony
is
16
of
them
in
the
record
and
the
kind
of
testimony
and
i
read
this
last
night,
put
one
man
on
the
stand
and
when
he
got
through
the
judge
said,
“well,
what
job
is
it
that
albemarle
didn't
give
you
because
of
your
race?
and
he
said,
“none”.
he
said,
“what
job
is
it
that
you
want?”
he
said,
“i
want
the
job
i
got
now.”
and
this
is
the
kind
of
testimony
that
is
the
background
of
the
judge's
exercise
of
his
discretion.
and
if
we
go
back
when
the
issue
of
backpay,
as
i
understand
it,
we
take
these
people,
try
to
find
out
by
through
evidence.
what
job
they
can
do?
was
there
ever
an
opening
in
it?
what
were
the
rights
to
pay?
could
they
have
qualified?
and
it
will
be
another
elaborate
proceeding
all
over
again.
in
conclusion
--
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
yes
sir.
as
first
motion
we
made
way
back
in
1967,
with
the
first
motion
we
made
your
honor
was
that
it
wasn't
a
proper
class
action
under
rule
23
and
that
is
time
when
we
raise
the
question
about
the
charges
being
filed
and
in
1967,
the
district
judge,
judge
larkins,
at
that
time
overruled
that
motion
and
we
try
to
--
when
we
got
to
before
judge
dupree,
he
said
he
wasn't
going
to
act
as
a
district
court,
i
mean,
an
appeal
court,
anything
that
judge
larkins
rule.
we
could
forget
about
to
see
when
going
to
change
that,
so
we
didn't
make
the
motion
before
hand.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
he
asked
that
the
class
was
described
by
judge
dupree,
where
this
case
--
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
well,
but
the
way
these
cases
go
in
the
district
court
they
say,
“we'll
treat
it
as
a
class
action
for
purposes
of
discovery
and
have
get
through
all
of
that
business,
then
will
come
back
and
describe
what
the
class
is
in
a
by
what
that
shows
up.”
and
this
is
a
balloon
as
process
very
costly.
mr.
francis
v.
lowden,
jr.
we
claim
they
did
not,
they
claim
they
did.
they
came
back
and
instead
of
telling
us
what
job
the
man
would
have?
what
job
he
was
qualified
for?
they
went
back
and
took
a
couple
of
people
who
are
employed
at
about
the
same
time.
one
might
be
white
and
he
made
$10,000.00
a
year,
one
might
be
black
and
he
made
$8,000.00
a
year.
then
they
would
claim
that
shows
that
the
mail
is
damaged
and
we
claim
that
we
were
entitled
at
that
trial
to
have
known
what
job
was
it
that
we
didn't
give
the
man
and
he
wanted
that
he
was
qualified
for
and
that
if
they
have
proof
of
case
like
that
and
you
might
have
different
situation
on
damages
but
here
nothing
was
shown.
in
fact,
witness
after
witness
said,
i'm
happy
judge
with
the
job
i've
got.
all
i
want
is
a
raise.
thank
you.
