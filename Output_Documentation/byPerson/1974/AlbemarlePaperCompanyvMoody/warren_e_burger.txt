mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.

have
you
given
the
signal?
yes.

chief

e.

very
well,
mr.

very
well
mr.

mr.
turner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
making
its
exercising,
its
discretion
in
the
district
court,
was
it
--
whether
it
had
been
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
take
into
account
the
efforts
of
the
employer
to
provide
training
courses
and
to
take
new
steps
after
1964
and
again
after
1968,
try
to
meet
these
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
griggs
the
employer
had
not
abandoned
the
high
school
diploma
requirement
as
they
had
here,
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
was
the
high
school
diploma
requirement
abandoned
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
any
comment
to
make
about
the
general
statement
which
i
do
not
associate
with
any
particular
figures
that
there
was
very
little
response
by
employees
to
the
training
program
developed
by
the
union
and
the
company
jointly?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that
be
an
appropriate
factor
for
the
district
judge
to
take
into
account
in
exercising
his
discretion
about
backpay?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
concede
i
take
it
that
this
is
not
quite
a
simple
matter
in
determining
a
violation
of
laws
as
it
is
in
some
other
areas
as?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
resume
there
after
lunch
mr.
turner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
turner,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
court
of
appeals
in
terms
before
that
the
district
judge
had
abused
his
discretion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
the
way
it's
ordinarily
done
when
there's
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
discretion
involved
in?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
essentially
on
accounting
process
so,
it
is
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
only
thing
remains
to
be
done?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
the
district
judge
be
free
in
your
view
to
make
inquiry
and
whether
or
not
a
particular
claimants
had
taken
an
advantage
of
the
union
company's
joint
training
program
and
put
that
in
the
scales
against
its
recovery?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
thought
you've
said
earlier
that
it
did
belong
there,
before
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
turner.
mr.
lowden,
i
believe
there's
10
minutes
remaining
for
a
petitioner's
side
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
lowden.

you,
gentlemen.
the
case

submitted.

justice
