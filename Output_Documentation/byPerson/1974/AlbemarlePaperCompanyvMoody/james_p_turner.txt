mr.
james
p.
turner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
appears
these
amicus
curiae
to
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
interpreted
the
law
and
its
decision
is
consistent
with
this
court's
opinion
in
griggs
and
is
otherwise
a
proper
application
of
the
will
of
congress.
turning
first
to
the
testing
issue
in
griggs
which
is
a
strikingly
parallel
case
in
many
respects
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
i
believe
the
location
of
this
plant
is
maybe
within
a
100
miles
of
the
griggs'
plant
in
north
carolina,
the
plant
involved
in
griggs
in
north
carolina
same
part
of
the
state.
and
this
court
set
forth
in
griggs
the
rule
of
job
relatedness
for
test
which
disproportionately
disqualify
black
workers.
the
--
such
test
should
be
enjoined
unless
the
employer
demonstrates
them
to
be
a
proper
and
valid
measure
of
the
employee
successful
performance
of
the
job.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
petitioners
had
failed
to
offer
convincing
proof
on
this
issue
although
a
validation
study
was
done,
we
believe
it
did
not
meet
most
--
the
most
basic
professional
standards
of
validation
and
even
if
it
was
accepted,
it
did
not
demonstrate
that
the
test
were
related
to
the
jobs
for
which
the
test
were
given.
in
short,
it's
just
not
the
kind
of
assurance
in
our
view
that
this
court
was
seeking
in
griggs
to
justify
the
use
of
test
which
have
a
disparate
effect
on
the
basis
of
race.
there
is
no
question
in
our
view
that
there
was
a
disproportionate
impact,
the
record
seems
to
justify
that
plaintiff's
exhibit
10,
when
analyzed
indicates
that
blacks
disproportionately
were
effective
by
the
testing
program.
the
tests
that
were
given
the
beta
test
and
the
wonderlic
a
and
b
were
given
to
all
applicants
in
the
affected
lines
and
the
rule
was
that
you
had
to
pass
the
beta
and
one
of
the
other
two
tests.
so
the
expert
was
hired
within
a
month
or
two
after
this
court's
opinion
griggs,
indicating
incidentally
that
the
company
must
have
felt
there
was
some
disproportionate
impact
or
some
need
under
griggs
to
validate
these
jobs.
he
came
there,
he
spent
a
half
day,
he
directed
the
test
be
given
to
some
incumbents
and
went
back
to
the
university
and
analyze
the
results
with
some
job
ratings
by
supervisors
that
were
also
provided.
the
eeoc
guidelines
which
this
court
indicated
should
have
great
deference
in
griggs
as
the
administrative
interpretation
by
the
agency
responsible
for
enforcement
of
the
law
and
which
other
courts
have
said
as
a
useful
framework
and
a
good
beginning
point
an
analysis
of
a
test
validation
study
simply
were
not
properly
followed
in
this
validation
study.
essentially
there
was
no
job
analysis
as
all
of
the
guidelines
and
all
the
professional
materials
seems
to
require
the
eeoc
guidelines,
the
civil
service
commission,
the
eeoc,
the
american
psychological
associations
standards,
i'll
say
you
start
by
looking
at
what
your
--
what
the
job
is
that
you're
going
to
validate
and
deciding
what
the
job
consist
of.
the
criterion
that
was
used
here
was
simply
how
well
is
the
guide
do?
when
he
is
feeling
right,
so
it
was
a
very
subjective
criterion,
even
the
way
the
expert
testified,
we
believe
that
the
testing
program
could
not
continue
and
was
properly
enjoined
because
he
had
studied
only
eight
lines
in
five
departments
and
with
other
job
analysis,
it's
impossible
to
verify
the
inference
that
he
made
that
this
made
it
properly
use
all
three
test
in
13
lines
in
18
departments.
i
think
on
this
record
the
court
should
decline
and
i
would
so
recommend
the
invitation
of
the
petitioners
and
amici
to
evaluate
the
testing
guidelines
of
the
eeoc
in
as
on
the
question
of
whether
they're
so
stringent
that
they
could
never
be
followed
this
is
just
not
the
case
or
the
record
in
which
that
issue
should
be
raised.
on
backpay,
turning
to
that,
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
congressional
scheme
in
title
vii
was
to
look
to
the
federal
courts
for
the
ultimate
enforcement
of
the
act
and
in
so
doing
congress
vested
the
courts
with
the
necessary
discretion
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act.
thus,
the
statute
says
the
courts
may
grant
injunctions,
says
they
may
award
backpay.
the
standard
for
the
exercise
of
the
court's
discretion
in
such
situations
in
our
view
is
to
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
act.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
this
regard
is
not
that
backpay
is
mechanically
compel
but
that
where
there
is
a
class
of
identified
victims
may
have
suffered
economic
loss
because
of
the
defendants
unlawful
employment
practices
unless
there
some
reason
not
to,
the
court
of
equity
should
proceed
to
design
and
issue
that
kind
of
an
order
which
will
make
those
victims
whole
as
nearly
as
maybe.
we
find
this
to
be
a
reasonable
formulation
consistent
with
this
court's
decisions
and
with
other
decisions
under
title
vii.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
think
that
would
be
a
proper
subject
for
the
district
court
to
address
as
you
indicated
in
the
griggs
opinion
your
honor.
it's
certainly
can
never
be
error
for
a
court
of
equity
to
address
the
question
of
good
faith
but
as
the
court
there
said,
“good
intent
does
not
redeem
the
employer's
conduct
that
since
congress
directed
the
thrust
of
the
act
to
the
consequences
of
employment
practice
not
simply
their
motivation.”
so,
while
we
think
it's
perfectly
proper
for
a
district
court
to
look
at
that
good
faith
of
a
party.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
believe
the
high
school
diploma
requirement
was
still
in
this
case
at
the
time
of
trial
too,
your
honor.
that
was
one
of
the
decisions
of
the
district
court.
mr.
james
p.
turner
in
this
case,
the
district
court's
order
said
that
since
the
wonderlic
test
were
substantially
an
equivalent
of
high
school
measure
that
he
did
not
reach
the
question
of
the
validation
effort
that
had
been
made
as
to
high
school
examination
or
high
school
diplomas
and
he
was
enjoining
their
continued
views.
mr.
james
p.
turner
studied
the
record
only
and
that's
the
limit
of
my
experience
in
this
case
your
honor
and
i've
--
i
don't
recall
any
statistics
in
the
record
as
to
the
participation.
i
know
there
were
some.
i
know
it
was
minimal
but
the
explanation
for
the
time,
i'm
sorry
i
can't
give
you.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
should
think
so,
yes,
your
honor
but
the
--
we
also
think
that
a
court
faced
with
such
a
question.
to
start
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
that
the
general
principle
that
we
would
urge
is
that
as
between
an
innocent
victim
of
discrimination
and
the
perpetrator
or
the
employer
or
union
violating
the
law,
the
economic
laws
presumptively
or
initially
at
least
ought
to
fall
on
the
people
it
violated
the
law
and
not
the
innocent
victims.
mr.
james
p.
turner
oh,
i
think
that's
right
your
honor,
the
record
here
is
quite
lengthy
and
quite
detailed
as
to
the
way
title
vii
was
applied
and
how
effective
be
the
seniority
system
and
how
the
lines
of
progression
had
to
be
merged
because
there
were
segregated.
all
those
things
a
court
has
to
go
into
a
great
detail.
when
it
concludes
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
pattern
and
practice
if
you
will
of
violating
title
vii,
then
we
think
that
any
identifiable
victims
who
can
prove
that
they've
suffered
economic
loss
because
of
that
pattern
in
practice
ought
normally
to
receive
backpay.
mr.
james
p.
turner
thank
you.
mr.
james
p.
turner
thank
you,
your
honor.
when
we
adjourned
we
were
--
i
was
discussing
the
good
faith
requirement
in
response
to
the
question
of
the
chief
justice.
certainly,
we
believe
it's
relevant
as
i
indicated
whether
a
defendant
in
this
title
vii
action
conduct
themselves
for
good
faith
as
the
court
indicated
in
griggs.
but
that
cannot
serve
as
a
justification
in
our
view
for
blanket
rule
that
no
one
gets
backpay.
the
problem
identified
by
the
court
of
appeals
here
was
the
district
court
apparently
without
consideration
of
the
make
whole
philosophy
of
the
act
had
declined
to
consider
backpay
for
any
member
of
the
victims
class
regardless
of
the
individual
merits
of
their
claims.
mr.
james
p.
turner
well,
that
mr.
justice
could
not
happen
as
a
practical
matter
unless
there
were
some
additional
proceedings
in
the
district
court
that
backpay
amounts
had
not
been
determined
and
the
identities
of
who
would
be
entitled
to
it,
had
not
been
determined
yet.
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
think
the
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
in
the
correct
one
is
to
look
to
the
purposes
of
the
law
that
make
whole
purposes.
as
i
say
the
court
of
appeals
decided
and
i
think
correctly
that
the
district
court
had
not
used
that
correct
standard
that
it
had
used
better
and
abstract
equity
standard
and
had
not
referred
to
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
the
purposes
of
the
make
whole
a
provision
of
restitution.
mr.
james
p.
turner
not
in
so
many
terms
--
in
so
many
words
your
honor,
no.
mr.
james
p.
turner
well,
if
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
if
you
want
it
to
phrased
it
that
way.
if
you
want
it
to
ask
me,
was
there
an
abused
of
discretion,
i'd
have
to
say
yes
but
i'd
hasten
to
add
that
the
such
abuses
there
was,
was
a
failure
to
consider
the
remedial
purposes
of
the
act
to
make
whole
provisions
which
congress
in
72
had
virtually
ratified
as
the
purpose
of
the
act
it
ratified
court
decisions
to
that
effect.
mr.
james
p.
turner
that
--
that
would
be
our
formulation
as
this
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
that's
correct.
mr.
james
p.
turner
there
is
no
remand
stated
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
of
as
i
indicated
an
answer
to
justice
rehnquist
to
--
there
has
to
be
additional
proceedings
before
any
of
backpay
can
be
awarded.
there
are
80
claimants
for
backpay.
now
the
question
before
the
court
is
which
one
those,
is
entitled
to
it?
mr.
james
p.
turner
oh,
i
think
not,
the
--
now,
as
we
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
what
they
were
saying
was
that
normally
unless
there's
some
reason
not
to,
a
class
of
victims
of
racial
discrimination
will
be
entitled
to
be
made
whole
for
any
economic
loss
they
suffered.
the
next
step
in
that
procedure,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
go
back
for
the
district
court
and
make
a
--
the
determinations
of
whether
there's
an
economic
loss
and
if
so
how
much.
mr.
james
p.
turner
oh,
i
think
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
i
think
that's
not
entirely
true
now,
we've
indicated
in
the
brief
that
reliance
on
female
protective
legislation
for
example
might
be
a
basis
for
some
discretion.
there'd
be
the
misconduct
of
particular
individuals
as
in
green
against
mcdonnell
douglas.
if
you
recall
the
facts
there
an
applicant
had
misbehaved
or
criminally
misbehaved
in
next
month
the
company.
mr.
james
p.
turner
well,
if
that's
where
it
belong
in
the
scales,
yes,
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
james
p.
turner
i've
said
it
was
relevant
now.
i'm
not
--
i
would
not
concede
that
it
should
be
controlling.
you
would
have
to
know
why
the
man
didn't
take
part
in
it
if
he
didn't.
what
the
program
was?
what
you
got
if
you
graduated
from
the
school
or
training
program?
whether
you
--
if
it
was
just
a
literacy
business
how
that
related
to
your
job
and
it
would
seem
to
me
you
would
have
to
make
the
kind
of
equitable
judgment
that
that
i'm
outlining.
and
they
are
in
the
phelps
dodge
case,
in
a
one
of
the
footnotes
the
supreme
court
indicated
the
kinds
of
discretion
that's
the
labor
board
had
normally
used
and
deciding
to
award
backpay
and
it
--
it
said
it
was
not
mechanically
compel
but
there
was
discretion
and
yet,
the
overall
goal
of
making
the
individual
whole
for
any
economic
loss
suffered
by
a
violation
of
the
law
should
be
the
touchstone.
we're
also
be
the
element
of
the
apportionment
of
the
loss
of
the
backpay
award
between
the
two
defendants
would
also
cause
call
from
some
discretion.
if
there
was
an
applicant
class
that
might
be
another
area
of
discretion
very
seriously
for
the
district
court
to
consider.
the
other
of
special
circumstance
cited
by
the
district
court
was
the
delay
in
bringing
the
issue
forward
involving
backpay
aside
from
the
that's
--
thank
you
very
much.
