mr.
warren
woods
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
for
the
union
petitioner
in
this
case,
in
our
view
the
question
presented
is
a
very
narrow
one.
it
is
paraphrasing
somewhat
the
question
presented
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
whether
a
court
of
appeals
has
the
power
in
a
title
vii
private
action,
to
order
the
trial
judge
to
award
backpay
as
a
matter
of
course,
whenever
unlawful
employment
practices
are
enjoined
absent
rarely
encountered
special
circumstances
despite
the
congressional
intendment
in
section
706
(g)
of
the
act,
that
the
district
court
in
its
discretion
may
order,
may
order
such
affirmative
action
as
maybe
appropriate
which
may
include
reinstatement
or
hiring
of
employees
with
or
without
backpay.
at
the
outset,
we
remind
the
court
that
the
afl-cio
with
which
this
local
union
is
affiliated
actively
supported
and
lobbied
for
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
its
later
amendment
in
1972.
indeed,
the
afl-cio
has
been
in
the
forefront
of
the
right
to
bring
equal
employment
opportunities
to
all
workers
regardless
of
race,
color,
sex,
religion
or
national
origin
or
for
that
matter
age.
we
do
not
under
this
statement
of
the
question
in
this
case,
the
question
the
propriety
of
backpay
relief
in
an
appropriate
case,
indeed,
in
many
cases
where
unions
have
been
plaintiffs
in
title
vii
actions.
we
have
aggressively
sought
such
relief
at
the
trial
court
level
and
it
often
succeeded
in
obtaining
it.
but,
despite
our
approval
of
the
philosophy,
the
policy
and
the
general
structure
of
the
act,
we
believe
as
this
court
has
often
recognized
in
decisions
relating
to
controversial
new
legislation.
that
type
of
legislation
is
the
product
of
give
and
take
between
opposing
groups
in
congress
and
compromise
produces
particular
forms
of
language
including
706
(g),
the
language
represents
the
political
judgment
of
people
in
congress.
and
we
believe
under
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
this
court
where
that
judgment
is
expressed
clearly
must
give
effect
to
it.
in
the
mandatory
version,
the
original
version
of
706
(g)
as
it
developed
in
the
house
would
have
made
the
granting
of
affirmative
relief
upon
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
act
mandatory.
the
actual
version
which
came
from
the
senate
side
which
was
adopted
as
the
present
706
(g)
and
that
uses
the
permissive
and
discretionary
language
which
are
mentioned
in
my
statement
of
the
issue.
now,
it
is
our
position
in
this
case
that
a
court
of
appeals
may
not
substitute
a
mandatory
back
rule
--
backpay
rule
whenever
injunctive
relief
is
granted
for
the
discretionary
rule
embodying
traditional
equity
principles
which
706
(g)
state
--
sets
forth.
in
short,
it
may
not
intrude
on
the
legislation's
sphere
by
divesting
the
district
court
to
the
traditional
equity
jurisdiction
vested
in
it
by
congress
and
in
effect
rewrite
the
legislation.
now,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
here
if
we
review
precisely
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case.
at
trial,
it
had
four
issues
before
you
as
mr.
--
before
it
as
mr.
lowden
stated
only
two
little
issues
where
three
of
them
really
need
concerns
as
here
now.
the
first
issue
was
whether
the
seniority
system
then
in
effect
has
result
of
collective
bargaining
between
the
union
and
the
company
operated
to
continue
into
the
present
the
effects
of
past
discrimination.
the
second
issue
was
whether
the
testing
under
a
system
was
unfair
to
blacks.
the
third
issue
was
whether
backpay
was
inappropriate
remedy
under
all
circumstances
of
the
case.
now
looking
first
at
the
seniority
system,
the
court
noted
that
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
there
have
been
a
segregation
of
jobs
as
between
blacks
and
whites
and
that
blacks
had
been
relegated
largely
to
the
lower
paying
jobs.
it
then
noted
however
that
in
1964,
the
employer
and
the
union
had
established
a
maintenance
apprenticeship
program
which
concentrated
on
the
recruitment
and
training
negro
applicants
for
that
program
and
that
the
maintenance
jobs
were
high
paid
jobs.
and
that
blacks
have
moved
into
that
program
and
some
had
succeeded
in
reaching
apprenticeship
jobs
and
higher
jobs.
it
noted
also,
that
the
parties
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
employer
and
the
union
had
earlier
on
open
up
all
lines
of
progression
to
transfers
from
other
lines
of
progression.
and
it
noted
specifically
that
in
1968
and
this
came
after
the
first
quarrel
versus
philip
morris
decree
in
the
local
189
crimes
at
the
back
decree
in
the
fifth
circuit.
in
68',
they
had
merged
separate
extra
boards
into
one
which
fed
all
lines
of
progression.
they
had
agreed
to
permit
transfers
between
line
of
progressions
on
the
basis
of
mills
seniority
instead
of
jobs
seniority
or
instead
of
on
an
arbitrary
acceptance
of
transfers
as
the
company
might
deem
proper.
they
also
agreed
to
allow
a
transferee
from
one
line
of
progression
into
another
to
carry
within
and
to
his
new
line
of
progression,
his
previously
acquired
departmental
and
jobs
seniority
which
was
testified
at
the
hearing
was
usually
tantamount
to
plant
seniority.
and
they'd
also
granted
in
order
to
encourage
blacks
to
transfer
from
lower
paying
lines
of
aggression
into
higher
paying
lines
of
progression,
they
granted
a
red
circle
rate
protection
arrangement
so
that
the
black
transferring
into
a
new
line
of
progression
at
an
entry
level
job
would
continue
to
receive
the
higher
rate
that
he
had
in
a
preceding
line
of
progression
until
he
reach
that
level
of
pay
in
his
new
line.
this
was
all
done
in
1968.
nevertheless,
the
court
completed
--
concluded
that
there
was
still
left
some
vestige
of
the
job's
seniority
system
in
this
picture
and
that
there
was
not
sufficient
posting
of
jobs
to
make
people
aware
of
when
they
were
available.
and
it
concluded
therefore
that
there
should
be
an
injunction
decree
issued
directing
certain
affirmative
action,
similar
to
that
which
had
been
issued
in
the
quarrels
under
the
crown
zellerbach
cases
and
he
did
so.
the
second
issue
dealing
with
the
testing
procedures
we
pause
on
briefly
to
say
mr.
lowden
has
argued
it,
the
union
has
taken
no
part
in
the
litigation
of
that
issue
or
in
its
briefing.
we
acknowledge
however
that
in
complex
operation
such
as
paper
mills
and
i
have
represented
the
international
union
in
this
field
for
some
25
or
30
years.
there
is
some
in
our
view
business
necessity
for
a
form
of
testing
as
long
as
it
meets
the
guidelines
and
accurately
predicts
ability
to
perform
the
job.
on
the
crucial
issue
of
backpay
in
this
case
however,
the
judge
refuse
to
award
it.
he
noted
first
that
under
706
(g),
he
had
a
broad
discretion
to
order
affirmative
action
with
or
without
backpay.
he
refused
to
order
backpay
because
of
the
good
faith
corrective
steps
which
the
parties
had
taken
without
delay
to
keep
up
with
the
expanding
state
of
a
law
and
because
plaintiffs
had
earlier
in
the
case
disavowed
any
backpay
they
claims
on
a
class
basis
and
had
changed
their
minds
nearly
five
years
after
the
institution
of
this
action.
this
is
one
of
the
first
cases
brought
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
charges
were
filed
with
the
eeoc
in
may
of
1966
and
this
action
was
brought
without
benefit
of
any
determination
from
the
eeoc
in
august
of
1966.
he
also
mentioned
and
explaining
his
refusal
to
grant
backpay,
the
business
necessity
in
this
industry
for
demanding
a
high
degree
of
training
and
skills
in
the
operation
of
complex
machinery
and
the
payment
of
wages
generally
higher
than
other
industries
in
the
area.
and
he
then
left
the
attorney's
fees
issue
to
later
determination
if
the
parties
could
agree
on
the
amount.
now,
there
had
been
an
opportunity
at
trial
to
present
specific
evidence
on
qualifications
and
individual
claims,
the
judge
had
said
that
he
would
try
this
as
a
matter
of
fact,
however
only
11
members
of
a
class
of
about
a
100
people
were
called
as
witnesses
in
person
in
five
testified
through
deposition.
the
record
shows,
the
appendix
shows
here
that
many
of
these
people
were
illiterate,
had
never
applied
for
higher
paying
jobs
and
had
not
even
attempted
to
go
to
a
school
which
the
company
in
the
union
jointly
set
up
and
operated
to
try
and
relieve
literacy
problems
of
both
white
and
black
employees
of
the
mill.
thus,
plaintiffs
had
an
opportunity
to
try
to
back
issue
--
backpay
issue
on
an
individual
basis
and
rejection.

actions,

wrote
opinion
and
judge
bryan
reviewed
the
record
and
finally
said
that

opinion,

be
payable

the
same
manner
as

fees
were
payable
