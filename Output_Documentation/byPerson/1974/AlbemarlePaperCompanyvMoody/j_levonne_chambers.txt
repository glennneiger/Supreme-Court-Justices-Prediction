mr.
j.
levonne
chambers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
has
been
indicated,
this
case
involves
a
present
for
review
basically
two
issues;
one
involving
the
company's
attempt
to
validate
a
test
that
has
been
using
since
around
1955;
and
the
other
the
standard
for
review
by
a
district
court
in
determining
whether
to
award
backpay
in
a
title
vii
class
action
proceeding
where
the
plaintiffs
have
established
a
clear
violation
of
the
act.
i
will
address
briefly
the
testing
issue
and
then
move
into
the
matter
of
backpay.
mr.
lowden
has
suggested
that
this
company
requires
some
training
and
preparation
for
a
party
to
work.
we
suggest
that
the
test
that
was
established
by
this
court
in
griggs
v.
duke
power
require
that
whatever
standard
or
criteria
are
adopted
if
those
standards
or
criteria
adversely
affect
black
employees
that
those
standards
and
criteria
cannot
be
used
unless
they
have
been
properly
validated.
in
griggs,
this
court
correctly
we
submit
adopted
a
harsh
standard
of
proof
for
companies
to
demonstrate
the
test
or
criteria
which
adversely
affect
black
employees.
properly
measure
a
man
before
the
job
rather
than
a
man
in
the
abstract.
only
by
following
guidelines
such
as
those
this
court
endorsed
in
griggs
like
the
eeoc
guidelines,
can
a
court
on
review
properly
determine
whether
efforts
by
a
company
to
validate
test
are
proper
and
properly
measure
a
man
before
the
job.
if
these
standards
are
not
adhered
to,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
griggs
v.
duke
power
will
in
effect
be
overruled.
one
of
the
first
requirements
then
a
proceeding
involving
testing
is
that
the
plaintiff
showed
an
adverse
impact.
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
more
than
abundantly
clear
in
the
record
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
we
show
statistically
an
adverse
impacts
on
black
employees
by
the
tests
are
used
by
the
company.
the
district
court
made
specific
findings
that
the
test
adversely
affected
black
employees.
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
blacks
were
not
in
the
skill
lines
of
progression,
the
lines
by
which
the
test
were
required
because
they
could
not
meet
the
educational
and
testing
requirements.
we
respectfully
submit
that
we
have
more
than
shown
and
adverse
impact
of
the
testing
battery.
on
that
showing,
the
burden
shift
it
to
the
company
to
establish
that
the
test
an
informant
criteria
properly
measured
the
applicants
for
the
job
or
the
employees
for
the
jobs.
we
submit
that
the
proof
is
presented
by
the
company
clearly
failed
to
establish
any
job
relatedness.
the
company
hired
a
testing
expert
to
validate
the
tests
after
this
court's
decision
in
griggs.
this
expert
selected
not
all
of
the
jobs
who
which
the
test
were
required
but
as
the
fourth
circuit
indicated
six
of
the
lines
of
progression
were
excluded.
of
those
jobs
that
we're
testing,
80%
proved
not
validated
or
not
correlated
to
the
test
and
the
evaluation
by
the
supervisors.
the
20%
of
those
groups
that
were
tested
in
which
the
company
claims
show
some
validation.
we
submit
that
the
criteria
or
procedure
followed
by
the
company
was
clearly
inadequate
to
establish
any
kind
of
job
relatedness.
as
the
fourth
circuit
pointed
out
the
company
fail
to
do
any
kind
of
job
analysis
and
that
was
essential
in
order
for
the
company
to
establish
any
correlation
between
the
test
score
and
the
supervisor's
rating
to
show
that
the
test
was
proper
--
were
properly
measuring
the
employee
for
the
job.
as
the
guidelines
require
and
we
submit
it
essential,
there
must
be
some
kind
of
job
analysis
and
selection
by
the
company
of
criteria
to
be
measured
in
order
that
we
don't
have
as
this
court
suggested
or
prohibited
in
griggs,
a
test
of
a
person
in
the
abstract.
the
fourth
circuit
pointed
out
that
the
company
had
failed
to
comply
with
the
guidelines
to
establish
a
properly
validated
test.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
--
that
decision
is
correct
and
should
be
affirmed
here,
since
the
company
has
not
validated
these
tests,
and
since
those
tests
do
have
adversely
effect
black
applicants
and
employees.
we
submit
that
the
test
and
program
should
be
enjoined
until
the
company
has
established
that
their
test
probably
--
properly
measure
the
applicants
for
the
job
and
that
they
are
job
relating.
mr.
j.
levonne
chambers
they
are
in
the
appendix,
in
volume
2
of
the
appendix,
i
think
beginning
on
page
305.
mr.
j.
levonne
chambers
before
this
court's
decision
in
griggs
case.
mr.
j.
levonne
chambers
yes.
they
were
adopted
in
1970.
this
court's
decision
was
in
1971.
mr.
j.
levonne
chambers
moving
then
to
the
question
of
backpay.
we
submit
that
in
considering
the
matter
of
backpay
that
the
court
should
keep
in
mind
that
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
company
and
union
here
which
simply
used
an
excluded
black,
simply
used
a
test
battery
which
excluded
blacks
from
better
paying
job
positions.
mr.
woods
suggests
that
the
afl-cio
support
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
then
might
well
be
but
there
were
many
locals
like
halifax
local
which
did
not.
this
company
and
union
are
some
black
employees
to
lower
paying
job
positions
and
then
constructed
a
seniority
system
which
prohibited
them
from
transferring
to
better
paying
positions.
despite
the
changes
that
were
made
in
1964
and
the
changes
that
were
made
in
1968,
the
district
court
found
correctly
that
those
changes
did
not
permit
black
employees
to
escape
the
past
discriminatory
practices
of
the
union
and
the
company.
the
court
further
found
that
because
of
these
practices,
black
employees
were
assigned
to
lower
paying
job
positions
and
sustain
substantial
economic
losses.
these
are
precisely
the
types
of
practices
that
congress
sought
to
reach
in
the
enactment
of
title
vii
in
1964.
we
submit
that
the
clear
purpose
of
congress
was
to
ensure
at
least
an
employment
opportunities
that
employees
could
advance
as
far
as
their
talents
and
skills
would
permit,
and
that
they
would
not
have
to
bear
the
financial
losses
which
might
be
occasioned
by
discriminatory
employment
practices.
congress
initially
placed
the
primary
responsibility
for
challenging
employment
discrimination
with
private
litigants.
these
responsibilities
were
continued
with
the
1972
amendments
even
though
eeoc
was
then
given
enforcement
authority.
the
significance
of
private
litigation
cannot
be
ignored
as
this
court
noted
in
newman
versus
piggie
park
that
title
ii
proceeding
involving
the
standards
that
should
be
followed
in
determining
whether
to
award
backpay.
private
litigants
in
these
proceedings
are
not
simply
seeking
to
enforce
the
private
right.
these
are
proceedings
public
in
nature
and
in
which
the
private
litigants
are
seeking
to
enforce
rights,
congress
has
considered
to
the
prior
--
highest
priority.
in
this
sense,
the
private
litigants
become
a
private
attorney
general,
necessarily
the
proceedings
affect
more
than
the
private
litigants
for
that
plaintiffs
were
challenging
an
employment
practice
applicable
to
or
directed
against
unidentifiable
class
as
here
black
employees.
class
actions
are
not
only
appropriate
but
are
clearly
warranted
and
in
order
to
ensure
the
implementation
of
congressional
purposes
of
the
act
including
particularly
encouraged
involuntary
compliance
or
private
litigation
for
voluntary
efforts
unsuccessful
and
making
hold
the
victims
of
the
discrimination.
this
court
should
as
congress
as
clearly
indicated
grant
broad
equitable
relief.
this
can
be
done
only
by
fashioning
an
objective
standard
as
in
newman
and
as
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
in
this
case
which
would
provide
for
injunctive
relief
and
backpay
unless
there
are
special
circumstances
which
would
render
such
an
award
unjust.
this
is
all
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
below
and
we
submit
that
it
should
be
affirmed
here.
in
looking
at
the
standard
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
adopted
and
which
has
been
adopted
now
in
the
several
circuits
that
are
cited
in
the
brief.
we
call
the
court's
attention
to
decisions
in
other
areas,
in
one
of
the
leading
cases
in
the
fairly
would
stand
the
fact
by
involving
the
fairly
would
stand
the
fact.
mr.
justice
harlan
set
forth
the
correct
principle,
we
submit,
which
should
govern
the
district
court
in
exercising
its
equitable
discretion
in
a
title
vii
proceeding.
that
case
was
mitchell
versus
robert
demario
jewelry
which
is
cited
in
the
brief.
there,
justice
harlan
stated
that
the
standard
which
should
govern
the
district
court
in
exercising
its
discretion
is
one
which
requires
that
the
district
court
exercise
the
discretion
in
order
to
enforce
the
purposes
of
congress
and
act
in
the
statute.
and
there
justice
harlan
noted
that
because
of
what
the
court
had
found
as
the
statutory
purpose
by
congress.
there
was
little
room
for
deny
there
recovery
under
the
act.
here,
in
order
to
in
carry
out
the
congressional
purpose
in
title
vii,
there's
very
little
discretion
to
deny
recovery
for
losses
by
victims
of
discrimination.
there
--
here,
only
by
providing
for
relief
unless
there
are
special
circumstances
will
the
court
be
able
to
carry
out
the
clear
purpose
of
congress
in
the
enactment
of
title
vii.
congress
has
shown
or
the
legislative
history
further
shows
that
this
was
a
clear
purpose
of
congress,
not
only
to
provide
for
injunctive
relief
but
to
provide
for
backpay
where
the
victims
have
shown
loss
as
a
result
of
discrimination.
in
the
1972
amendments,
the
legislative
history
there
clearly
shows
that
congress
intended
to
provide
backpay
and
to
provide
class
action
and
class
action
backpay.
the
section
by
section
analysis
of
the
--
that
act
in
1972
are
clearly
shows
that
congress
intended
to
provide
for
class
action
proceedings
and
to
provide
backpay
relief.
the
several
circuits
which
have
considered
the
act
have
held
that
congress
intended
not
only
injunctive
relief
but
backpay
as
well.
a
similar
purpose
in
the
construction
of
a
statute
such
as
the
court
has
done
it
below
are
--
is
also
been
sustained
in
other
proceedings.
we
have
referred
the
court
in
the
brief
to
nlrb
proceedings
where
the
court
has
found
a
similar
necessity
for
providing
backpay
as
the
fourth
circuit
has
noted
in
this
proceeding
below.
mr.
j.
levonne
chambers
i
would
--
that's
correct
your
honor
but
still
the
court
are
requires
that
that
the
discretion
be
exercised
with
the
view
toward
there
enforcing
the
act.
mr.
j.
levonne
chambers
not
unless
--
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
here
that
in
constructing
on
--
the
statute
and
given
it
meaning
that
the
court
should
look
at
the
purpose
of
congress
in
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
that
purpose
being
as
the
several
courts
have
indicated
to
provide
injunctive
relief
and
to
make
the
victim
whole.
we
think
that
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
district
court
should
be
limited
in
the
sense
of
requiring
that
the
district
court
exercise
that
discretion
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
intent
of
congress.
here
that
intent
being
to
make
the
victim
whole
in
addition
to
provide
an
injunctive
relief.
mr.
j.
levonne
chambers
we
think
that
the
decision
we
cite
in
phelps
dodge
corporation
which
has
been
cited
interestingly
by
all
parties
clearly
holds
that
the
quality
of
board
has
discretion
it
must
exercise
that
discretion
with
the
view
toward
the
purpose
of
the
congress
in
the
act.
mr.
j.
levonne
chambers
congress
did
not
say
that
you
must
award
backpay
in
language
in
the
act
but
we
think
that
in
the
legislative
history
in
1972,
the
intent
of
congress
to
make
the
victim
hold
is
clear.
the
section
by
section
analysis
from
the
committee
which
we
refer
to
in
the
brief,
clearly
points
out
that
congress
intended
class
action
proceedings
and
intended
to
make
the
victim
hold.
and
we
think
here
that
in
reading
the
statute
that
the
court
will
--
should
find
that
the
purpose
was
to
make
the
victim
hold
and
this
can
be
done
only
by
awarding
her
backpay.
we
think
that
the
standard
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit
is
necessary
for
policy
reasons
without
a
provision
for
black
backpay.
there's
no
incentive
to
a
company
or
union
to
review
there
--
review
as
practices
and
to
make
changes
were
appropriate
rather
like
the
petitioners
in
this
proceeding,
an
employer
or
--
and
union
would
simply
sit
back
or
make
superficial
changes
until
compelled
to
do
so
by
the
act.
similar
examples
of
recounts
as
this
found
not
only
employment
discrimination
cases
but
in
school
desegregation
cases
as
well
and
another
civil
rights
cases
which
this
court
has
had
the
many
occasions
to
consider.
uniformity
and
enforcement
is
promoted
by
the
standard
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit.
indeed,
the
standard
adopted
by
this
court
in
newman
which
is
basically
the
standard
--
that
was
adopted
by
the
fourth
circuit
below
has
and
should
was
with
compliance
with
title
ii
and
virtually
no
need
for
further
litigation
in
title
ii
--
in
the
title
ii
area.
contrary
to
the
petitioner's
contention,
the
standard
does
not
deprive
the
district
courts
of
all
discretion.
examples
of
the
discretion
which
remains
are
cited
by
the
fourth
circuit
below.
nor
are
their
any
special
circumstances
in
this
case
which
would
render
an
award
of
backpay
unjust.
the
defendants
assert
that
they
have
not
acted
in
bad
faith
but
have
sought
correct
their
practices
as
the
law
evolved.
good
faith
however,
is
not
an
issue
in
this
proceeding.
the
black
employees
who
have
suffered
from
the
discriminatory
practices
of
the
company
have
nevertheless
been
victimized
even
if
petitioner's
good
faith
in
doing
so
were
in
issue.
title
vii
was
designed
to
make
the
victim's
whole
for
is
the
result
of
the
practice
rather
than
the
motif
or
purpose
that
congress
sought
to
remedy.
as
the
courts
have
noted
on
many
occasions
backpay
is
not
a
penalty
imposed
as
a
sanction
for
more
interpretive
it
is
--
but
is
compensation
for
tangible
economic
loss
resulting
from
an
unlawful
employment
practice.
more
with
the
good
faith
proposed
by
the
petitioners
here
would
introduce
additional
means
for
limiting
the
effectiveness
of
title
vii
and
defeating
the
purposes
of
congress
in
its
enactment.
although
the
petitioners
made
some
changes
in
1964
and
1968,
the
district
court
has
indicated
previously
noted
that
these
changes
did
not
relieve
blacks
from
the
prior
discriminatory
practices
of
the
past.
nothing
prevented
the
petitioners
in
this
proceeding
from
doing
more
prior
to
trial
to
bring
their
practices
into
compliances
with
title
vii,
and
eliminating
all
restitutes
of
past
discrimination,
and
clearly
the
victims
of
the
discrimination,
the
class
members
here
cannot
be
charged
with
bad
faith
and
their
equities
for
out
way
the
equities
of
the
petitioners,
particularly
considering
the
limited
resources
of
the
victims
involved
in
this
proceedings.
the
fact
that
the
company
paid
higher
wages
than
some
other
employees
in
the
area
does
not
provide
an
adequate
basis
for
denying
backpay.
black
employees
in
the
area
still
were
deprived
of
earnings
solely
because
of
their
race
and
are
entitle
to
relief
under
title
vii,
nor
does
the
delay
in
a
specifically
preempt
for
backpay
by
the
class
from
obtaining
relief.
although,
the
plaintiffs
did
not
specifically
pray
for
backpay
in
the
complaint
and
at
an
early
stage
in
the
proceeding
indicated
that,
they
were
not
seeking
backpay
for
the
class,
the
plaintiffs
made
their
intention
to
seek
backpay
for
the
class
clear
more
than
a
year
before
trial.
the
district
court
by
order
more
than
a
year
before
trial
indicated
that
backpay
was
still
an
issue,
in
addition,
to
setting
forth
long
before
trial
comparative
earnings
of
black
and
white
employees.
the
plaintiffs
before
trial
submitted
answers
to
interrogatories
and
supplemented
these
answers
before
trial
to
show
the
claims
for
backpay
of
each
individual
member
of
a
class.
we
submit
that
there
is
neither
