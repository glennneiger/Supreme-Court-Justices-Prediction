rehnquist
well,
if
that's
the
case,
is
this
an
appropriate
case
for
us
to
grant
plenary
review,
and
if
there
really
isn't
the
kind
of
conflict
that
i
got
the
impression
that
was
from
your
petition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
corrigan,
could
i
ask
you
--
well,
i
guess
it
just
over
purely
mechanical
question.
in
the
appendix,
there
appear
to
be
two
sets
of
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions
of
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
is
28
and
29
and
the
others
161.
is
one
the
one's
prepared
by
you
and
the
other
prepared
by
your
adversary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
page
28
and
29?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
then
the
findings
at
161
of
the
appendix
weren't
ever
a
signed
by
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
--
mr.
engel,
your
--
their
conclusion
of
law
you
proposed
at
163
was
that
the
plaintiff
was
an
employee
of
the
defendant?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
conclusion
that
judge
zirpoli
reached,
the
conclusion
of
law,
on
page
30
of
the
appendix,
is
really
quite
a
different
reasoning
process,
isn't
it
than
yours
is
relying
on
baker
versus
texas
in
pacific?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
unwilling
to
say
that
he
that
--
your
man
was
an
employee
of
southern
pacific,
judge
zirpoli
was?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
that's
the

is

justice
william

william

so
that

what
