mr.
john
j.
corrigan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
perceive
the
issue
in
this
case,
it
is
shall
the
fela
law
be
extended
to
include
persons
other
than
employees
of
railroad.
all
of
the
cases
cited
by
all
of
the
parties
save
and
except
one,
make
a
finding
of
employment
by
a
railroad,
whether
its
through
a
borrowed-servant
doctrine,
a
joint-servant
doctrine,
an
alter
ego
doctrine
or
some
doctrine,
they
all
make
a
finding
of
employment.
counsel
says
that
the
tenth
circuit
harmonizes
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit.
the
tenth
circuit
case
he
has
in
mind
is
hearson
versus
the
k-t
railroad.
it's
cited
in
the
briefs
in
it's
422
f.
2d.
the
court
finds
in
hearson,
hearson
was
an
employee
of
the
k-t.
in
other
words,
the
k-t
sold
its
car
cleaning
facilities
to
try
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
the
act.
but
they
kept
control
over
mr.
hearson
and
the
court
says
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he
sweeps
from
the
right
or
the
left.
the
point
is
the
railroad
still
maintained
the
necessary
control
and
because
they
did
that,
mr.
hearson
continued
to
be
an
employee.
now,
he
also
relies
and
he
just
cited
that
a
circuit
court
case,
byrne
versus
pennsylvania
railroad.
there,
you
had
westinghouse
engineer
whose
job
it
was
to
service
sophisticated
locomotives
after
they
were
sold
to
the
company,
the
railroad
company,
and
he
came
on
the
railroad
property,
and
he
worked
on
these
locomotives.
and
he
came
under
the
control
of
the
railroad
and
that
case
held,
he
was
a
joint
employee.
there
was
a
conventional
common
law
employment
relationship
that
developed
which
was
not
developed
in
the
case.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
he
work
there
for
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that
was
the
finding
sir.
the
conventional
finding
of
employment
which
is
not
in
this
case,
and
the
case
that's
relied
upon,
and
it's
from
the
fourth
circuit
is
unique
and
it's
different
in
that
it
is
the
only
case
that
does
not
find
employment.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it's
hearson,
h-e-a-r-s-o-n
versus
missouri-kansas
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it's
in
counsel's
brief
i
believe
in
one
of
his
briefs.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it's
422
f.
2d,
1037.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
422
f.
2d,
1037.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it's
texas
railway
against
hearson.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
and
i
--
it's
m
k-t
versus
hearson.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
believe
so.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i'd
like
to
point
one
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
i'd
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
if
we
may,
we'll
go
to
the
point.
counsel
says,
“this
is
a
case
where
the
appellate
court
sought
to
change
the
findings
to
reevaluate
them,
to
interpret
them.
”
they
didn't.
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
begins
and
ends
with
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
found
that
mr.
kelley
was
an
employee.
he
was
in
the
employment
of
the
pmt.
he
was
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that
finding
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
he
was
--
the
exercise
of
control
was
that
of
the
pacific
motor
trucking
company
in
his
root
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yeah.
the
responsibility
serve,
but
it
doesn't
say
the
control
was
in
the
southern
pacific
sir.
it
does
not
say
the
right
of
control
was
in
the
southern
pacific.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no.
could
i
explain
why?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
alright,
sir.
the
railroad
in
the
20th
century
became
--
become
a
very
sophisticated
operation.
we
have,
for
example,
computers
that
help
run
the
transportation
system.
we
have
sophisticated
telephone
systems.
we
don't
have
the
where
with
all
of
the
knowledge
to
run
these
computers,
but
we
have
the
responsibility
to
see
that
they
run
so
the
railroad
could
continue
running.
does
that
makes
all
the
ibm
employees
who
come
in
and
fix
those
computers,
railroad
employees
for
the
purposes
of
the
fela?
does
that
make
all
the
telephone
company
employees
for
the
purpose
of
the
fela?
these
are
employees
of
another
company.
and
counsel
acknowledged
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
we're
talking
about
a
subsidiary
company
or
some
other
company?
there
are
many
things
in
the
railroad
enterprise
that
have
to
be
done
by
others.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
we
have
a
responsibility
in
control
mr.
chief
justice
to
see
that
the
job
got
done,
that
was
to
see
that
railroad
cars
got
--
became
unloaded
under
the
tariff.
but
there's
a
difference,
it
seems
to
me
between
responsibility
to
see
that
the
result
gets
--
becomes
fact,
and
having
control
or
the
right
of
control.
you
can
hire
an
independent
contractor
and
that
doesn't
get
you
the
right
of
control.
we
don't
have
the
right
of
controlling
those
ibm
employees
when
they
come
into
fix
our
computers.
i'd
like
to
touch
on
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
best
thing
in
this
case
is
the
findings
of
the
district
judge
for
the
southern
pacific
company.
he
rejected
the
proposed
findings
of
the
petitioner
because
the
petitioner
requested
a
finding
that
the
southern
pacific
was
an
employer.
the
district
judge
knew
he
could
not
make
that
finding
because
the
evidence
wouldn't
support
it.
he
there
found
--
fore
found
that
employment
was
in
the
southern
pacific
company.
the
scope
of
coverage
of
an
fela
case
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
he
therefore
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
misspoke
myself.
i'm
very
sorry.
he
therefore
found
that
he
was
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
an
employee
of
the
pacific
motor
trucking
company.
i
want
to
touch
on
a
concept
that
this
court
has
developed
in
the
fela
field
and
it
has
to
do
with
non-delegable;
the
words
non-delegable.
the
concept
of
non-delegable
related
to
non-delegable
duties.
there
are
not
cases
of
this
court
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
there
are
two
concepts
that
though
that
i
wanted
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
there
are
two
concepts
so
that
i
think
it's
important.
it's
my
duty
to
make
clear.
one
deals
with
non-delegable.
non-delegable
refers
to
duty.
it
is
not
a
concept
developed
by
this
court
which
creates
employment.
once
you
have
employment
and
work
for
a
railroad
and
are
an
employee
of
a
railroad
as
all
the
cases
that
held
you
have
to
be
to
come
under
the
act,
then
the
railroad
has
a
non-delegable
duty
to
furnish
you
a
safe
place
to
work.
and
that
fact
that
you
send
your
railroad
employee
out
on
another
railroad
or
out
to
a
shipper's
premises
and
he
gives
an
unsafe
condition
there,
you
can't
say
as
a
railroad
but
we
don't
know
you
because
you
got
hurt
there.
no,
you
have
a
non-delegable
duty
and
that's
the
concept
in
which
non-delegable
came
up
and
the
district
court
became
confused
with
it.
now,
as
to
operational
activity,
that
concept
is
very
much
confused
by
the
smith
decision
in
the
fourth
circuit.
operational
activity
is
a
concept
which
protects
employees
who
are
in
fact
employed
by
railroad.
in
huston,
texas,
the
missouri
pacific
contracted
out
its
switching
business
and
they
had
an
employee
in
a
railroad
car
and
the
switching
company,
who
is
doing
their
operational
work
for
them,
ran
the
car
into
the
missouri
pacific
car
in
which
a
missouri
pacific
admitted
employee
was
standing
and
hurt
him
and
this
court
says,
“this
is
really
an
extension
of
an
agency
principle.
you
--
they
--
you
can't
let
someone
else
do
your
operational
work
and
then
deprive
your
own
employees
of
a
right
of
recovery
because
they
are
your
employees.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
i
think
this
raises
another
very
interesting
point
and
it's
this.
if
you
analyze
the
act
very
carefully,
you
see
that
there
are
three
classes
involved.
there's
a
plaintiff
class,
and
the
only
plaintiffs
that
come
under
that
act
and
can
recover
are
employees
of
common
carriers
by
railroad,
not
employees
of
agents
of
common
carriers
by
railroad.
this
court
in
1950
and
again,
in
1959
said,
this
term
employee
and
employed
is
not
used
in
any
special
sense.
it's
just
the
conventional,
whatever
the
conventional
meaning
of
the
word
employee
is.
and
if
to
be
an
employee,
you
have
to
be
in
someone's
employment
and
you
don't
get
to
be
an
employee
of
railroad
by
being
employed
by
an
agent
of
the
railroad.
”
this
court
made
that
very
clear
in
the
baker
case
in
1959.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
which
they
did
not
do
in
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
other
thing
--
the
other
class
is
the
class
of
carriers,
employers
into
the
act.
the
class
of
employers
are
common
carriers
by
railroad,
and
if
you
don't
work
for
railroad
for
the
simple
as
i
can
your
honors,
you
don't
come
on
to
the
act.
this
court
held
that
six
years
ago,
in
the
edwards
case.
you
have
to
work
for
a
railroad
or
you
don't
come
under
the
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
can
explain
that.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
findings
in
the
low
number
pages
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
are
the
findings
as
signed
by
the
court.
the
ones
at
the
end
of
the
book
are
the
findings
as
proposed
by
the
petitioner
and
is
rejected
by
the
court.
the
petitioner
asked
to
have
the
court
find
that
his
client
worked
for
a
railroad,
petitioner's
attorney
asked
that,
and
the
court
says,
“no,
i
can't
find
it.”
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
he
doesn't
work
for
railroad.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
sir.
that
was
the
proposed
by
it.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that
was
the
proposed
findings.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
yes
sir?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
you
picked
a
very
unusual
fact
situation.
they
both
would
of
because
the
belt
railroad
is
also
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
and
it's
employ
--
he's
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
both
railroads,
if
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
both
railroad
--
here's
what
would
happen.
the
belt
railroad
was
negligent
and
if
it
hurt
one
of
its
employees,
it'd
be
liable
on
that
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
alright.
now
that
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
other
railroad
would
be
responsible
because
it
gave
up
an
operational
activity
to
the
belt
railroad
and
because
it
gave
up
an
operational
activity
to
the
belt
railroad,
it
cannot
escape
the
consequences
action,
to
its
own
employees
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
the
missouri
pacific
under
those
facts
would
be
liable
to
the
belt
railroad's
employees
who
are
injured
because
the
belt
railroad's
employees
were
not
under
their
control.
they
were
not
their
employees.
the
negligence
was
the
act
of
the
belt
railroad
and
not
the
missouri
pacific.
so,
the
missouri
pacific
would
only
be
liable
to
its
own
employees.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
only
for
purposes
--
only
be
--
and
i
was
about
to
get
to
that
and
i
think
i
can
explain
it
this
way
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
the
next
thing
i
want
to
come
to
that's
very
important.
i've
tried
to
describe
three
classes
that
come
under
this
act.
the
employee
class,
the
employer
class,
and
now
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
third
class
which
i
think
relates
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
the
third
class
are
people
or
organizations
referred
to
in
the
act
are
the
people
or
organizations
for
whom
the
railroads
are
responsible;
officers,
agents
and
employees
of
railroads.
now
note,
the
word
agent
is
used
with
reference
to
those
people
for
whom
a
railroad
is
liable,
for
whose
conduct
they
are
liable.
the
word
agent
is
no
way
used
with
reference
to
the
employee
class.
it's
used
in
the
one
part
of
the
statute,
but
not
in
the
other.
there's
good
reason
for
that.
we've
quoted
the
legislative
history
here
quite
extensively.
it
was
relied
on
it
by
this
court
and
quoted
extensively
by
this
court
six
years
ago
in
edwards
versus
pacific
fruit
express
and
it
was
relied
on
specifically
by
the
circuit
court
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear
that
congress
did
not
want
teamsters
or
truck
companies
under
the
act.
so
i
think,
that
partially
explains
why
the
concept
of
agency
doesn't
relate
to
the
plaintiff
class.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir,
the
teamsters
union.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
some
motor
carrier
operating
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
in
nine
western
states.
there
has
been
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
pacific
motor
trucking
company.
they
are
paying
for
the
pension,
medical,
and
everything.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
what's
that
sir?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
i'm
sure
the
pacific
motor
trucking
company
would
--
you've
asked
a
question
for
which
i
can't
find
any
legal
authority
one
way
or
another.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
and
i'm
sure
the
pacific
motor
trucking
company
would
work
your
honor
on
the
opposite,
for
the
opposite
result.
you
know,
there
are
something
else
about
this
case
that's
very
important,
and
it's
this.
because
railroads
have
been
around
a
long
time,
people
think
in
terms
that
they
should
be
able
to
do
everything
for
themselves
because
at
one
time,
they
did.
they
had
their
own
carpenters
a
hundred
years
ago,
their
own
plumbers,
their
own
sheet
metal
workers
and
everything,
but
we
don't
live
in
that
kind
of
world
anymore.
the
work
that
was
being
done
by
mr.
kelley
in
this
case
was
not
railroad
work,
it
was
teamsters'
work.
the
record
in
this
case,
specifically
the
testimony
of
mr.
cochins
shows
the
following
to
be
true
and
i
think
this
is
very
important.
this
trucking
company
was
organized
and
formed
in
the
early
1930's
and
about
1937,
they
built
highway
trailers,
the
truck
company,
the
pmt
to
carry
automobiles
along
the
roadway
in
trailers,
the
driveway
track
thing
you
see
and
the
pmt
employees
like
kelley
in
1937
loaded
and
unloaded
those
trailers.
about
1950,
the
railroads
started
what
was
known
as
piggy
back
service.
that
piggy
back
service
was
flat
cars
on
which
they
would
put
vans,
trucks.
and
little
later,
one
of
the
kinds
of
vans
or
trucks
they
put
on
the
railroad
cars
were
these
highway
trailers
that
carried
automobiles.
the
actual
truck
trailer
with
the
automobiles
on
it
was
tied
on
the
railroad
car
and
it
was
a
form
of
piggy
backing.
the
same
teamster
employees
who
were
performing
that
works
since
1937
performed
in
the
loading
and
unloading
on
the
railroad
cars;
the
loading
and
unloading.
then
in
the
early
60's,
the
railroad,
the
railroads
of
this
country
designed
what's
knows
as
bi-level
and
tri-level
cars
and
they
did
a
way
with
putting
the
trucks
--
the
autos
on
the
trucks
on
the
cars.
they
just
put
the
cars
on
train
--
on
the
railroad
cars
--
the
automobiles
on
the
railroad
cars,
but
the
significant
thing
is
this.
the
same
employees,
the
same
teamsters
like
kelley,
who
had
been
there
eight
years
doing
this
work
continued
to
do
the
work,
it
was
never
done
by
railroaders.
and
why
should
anyone
suppose
it
should
be
done
by
railroaders?
there's
a
lot
of
work
that
comes
under
a
railroad
carrier
that
is
not
railroad.
there
a
lot
of
peripheral
industries
that
work
with
a
railroad
and
their
activities
are
carried
under
a
tariff,
there
are
cases
on
our
brief
on
this,
but
they
are
not
railroading.
this
court
said
six
years
ago,
the
last
case
decided
on
the
question
of
coverage
under
the
act
was
edwards
versus
pacific
fruit
express.
this
court
said
there
a
lot
of
things
that
look
like
railroading,
but
they're
not
railroad.
in
the
edwards'
case,
that
company
owned
railroad,
switch
engines,
head
tracks,
move
box
cars,
own
cars,
did
switching
but
they
weren't
a
common
carrier
by
rail.
not
being
a
common
carrier
by
rail,
their
employees
couldn't
come
under
the
act.
so
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
that
question
sir.
in
the
first
place,
we
have
to
look
at
it
in
the
context
that
contracting
out
to
avoid
the
act
would
be
bad.
if
you
were
avoiding
it
with
reference
to
your
obligations
to
your
own
employees
which
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir,
which
kelley
was
not
in
this
case.
we
always
have
to
start
there.
kelley
was
not
an
employee
of
the
railroad.
now,
contracting
out
that,
sir,
can
be
prevented
if
it's
evil,
if
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
if
it's
wrong,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
in
contravention
of
section
5
contracting
out.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
if
it
is
and
i
don't
agree
that
it
is,
but
let's
assume
for
the
purpose
of
argument.
well,
no,
i
can't
agree
that
contracting
out
is
prohibited
by
the
act.
what's
prohibited
by
the
act
is
taking
a
release
from
an
employee
or
when
he
signs
up
for
employment,
i
promise
not
to
sue
you.
that's
what
section
5
is
all
about,
but
section
5
doesn't
deal
with
contracting
out.
but
you
see,
contracting
out
can
be
handled
by
other
laws
and
institutions,
not
by
an
improper
interpretation
contrary
to
legislative
intent
of
the
fela.
the
fela
said
--
that
congress
said
and
this
court
said
congress
said
it
six
years
ago,
“that
the
fela
only
applies
to
employees
of
railroads.
”
now
with
that
in
mind,
this
court
shouldn't
strain
to
worry
about
contracting
out
and
in
the
process,
improperly
interpret
the
fela
for
this
reason.
contracting
out
will
be
prevented
by
the
railway
labor
act
and
by
the
united
transportation
union.
if
the
railroad
decided,
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
contract
out
all
the
work
of
our
locomotive
engineers.
the
unions
would
file
a
section
6
notice
and
there
would
be
a
nationwide
strike
sooner
or
later,
and
they
couldn't
do
it.
so
i
think,
it's
so
highly
theoretical
and
to
worry
about
theoretical
things
like
that
and
interpret
the
act
where
it
shouldn't
go.
where
this
court
says
it
shouldn't
go
six
years
ago
would
be
wrong.
another
thing
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
about
contracting
out
why
it
wouldn't
work.
the
railroad
operations,
pick
a
train
moving
from
san
francisco
to
salt
lake
city
is
a
very
integrated
type
of
operation.
the
engineer
has
to
rely
on
the
conductor
for
his
signals
who
has
to
rely
on
the
brakeman,
who
has
to
rely
on
the
dispatcher,
who
has
to
rely
on
someone
else.
if
you
contracted
out
the
work
of
the
conductors
or
the
brakemen
or
the
engineer,
those
people
would
still
be
controlled
by
the
railroad
because
it's
still
so
integrated
and
this
court
wouldn't
have
any
trouble
finding
if
the
contracting
out
came
to
pass,
which
it
won't.
this
court
wouldn't
have
any
difficulty
finding,
the
railroad
still
maintaining
control.
the
conductor
is
still
telling
the
engineer
when
to
move,
the
train
dispatcher
still
telling
them
when
they
can
leave
the
station,
the
train
master
still
running
the
show,
there
is
still
requisite
control
and
supervision
over
these
employees
who
have
been
contracted
out.
so,
the
railroad
may
think
it's
contracting
them
out
but
this
court
would
hold
that
the
control
is
still
there,
the
control
that
is
not
in
the
kelley
case.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
this
court
--
this
court
said
no
and
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
but
what
they
said
--
what
this
court
said
in
robinson
versus
baltimore
ohio
in
1915,
that
there
are
many
things
that
happen
on
the
railroad
that
are
not
really
railroading
in
the
sense
that
congress
intended
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it's
a
common
carrier
function
for
railroad
to
pull
a
pullman
car
and
they
are
still
pullman
cars,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir,
and
didn't
come
under
the
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
--
yes,
sir.
it
would
if,
if
the
congress
would
have
wanted
it
too,
but
congress
didn't
want
to
and
this
courts
said
they
didn't
want
to
in
the
robinson
case.
we
have
extensive
legislative
history
your
honor,
in
our
brief
and
this
court
holds
extensive
legislative
history
in
the
opinion,
in
the
edwards
case
which
i
keep
coming
back
to
by
justice
black.
this
court
relied
on
it
and
this
court
said
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
legislation
dealing
with
railroads
in
the
decade
of
the
30's,
wherein
congress
if
it
wanted
to,
could
have
included
other
people,
but
congress
specifically
excluded
other
people
and
they
specifically
excluded
teamsters.
then,
when
we
got
around
to
the
1939
amendment
of
the
fela,
congress
was
asked
to
include
trucking
companies
and
teamsters,
and
congress
said
no.
and
the
ninth
circuit
is
cognizant
of
that,
and
they
make
the
reference
to
the
report
--
the
report
in
their
opinion.
but
i
urge
upon
you
that
not
only
the
ninth
circuit
is
aware
of
it,
but
this
court
was
aware
of
it
and
this
court
relied
heavily
on
it
in
the
edwards
case.
i
want
to
allude
to
another
thing
that's
important.
there
is
no
particular
kind
of
railroad
activity
that
is
magic.
if
you're
doing
a
certain
kind
of
work,
you
must
be
a
railroader.
when
this
court
interpreted
the
1939
amendment
in
a
case
called
reed
versus
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
this
is
what
it
said.
the
railroad
was
all
upset
because
mrs.
reed
was
a
clerk
and
the
wind
that
blew
in
her
office
and
cut
her
on
the
face
and
they
said,
well
you're
not
a
railroader.
you
don't
have
the
suit
on
you
on
your
face,
and
cinders
in
your
hair,
and
calluses
on
your
hand.
you're
a
clerk.
you
can't
have
a
recovery
under
this
act
and
this
court
said
what
counts
is
in
order
to
come
under
the
act,
not
what
she
do.
you
can
be
a
clerk
and
come
under
this
act
and
since
that
opinion,
every
clerk
has
come
under
this
act.
what
counts
is
that
you
have
to
be
in
the
employment
of
a
railroad
which
and
doing
work
which
closely
or
substantially
effects
interstate
commerce.
mr.
kelley
was
not
in
the
employment
of
a
railroad.
it
was
specifically
had
so
held
by
the
trial
court.
i
think
that
for
whatever
reasons
there
is
a
direct
conflict,
and
there's
no
way
around
it
between
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit.
and
the
legislative
history
as
interpreted
by
this
court
and
the
decisions
in
robinson
of
this
court
and
baker
of
this
court,
clearly
indicate
that
the
fourth
circuit
is
an
error
in
that
one
case.
there's
only
one
case,
it's
smith
versus
norfolk
&
western,
in
which
they
said,
“we
find
that
mr.
smith
is
not
an
employee
of
a
railroad.
but,
it
doesn't
matter
to
us.
he
is
an
employee
of
an
agent
of
a
railroad.
”
and
the
ninth
circuit
recognizes,
this
supreme
court
has
recognized
on
many
occasions,
that
isn't
enough.
you
have
to
be
an
employee.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it
was
on
50%
by
the
southern
pacific
transportation
company
and
50%
by
the
union
pacific
railroad
company.
but
again
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
i
like
that
case,
judge,
your
honor.
[attempt
to
laughter]
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
your
honor,
it
was
[attempt
to
laughter]
there's
one
other
thing.
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
was
not
asked
to
decide
questions
of
law
only.
this
was
a
bifurcated
trial.
he
was
the
fact
finder.
thank
you
very
much
for
the
time
and
privilege
of
being
here
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
perceive
the
issue
in
this
case,
it
is
shall
the
fela
law
be
extended
to
include
persons
other
than
employees
of
railroad.
all
of
the
cases
cited
by
all
of
the
parties
save
and
except
one,
make
a
finding
of
employment
by
a
railroad,
whether
its
through
a
borrowed-servant
doctrine,
a
joint-servant
doctrine,
an
alter
ego
doctrine
or
some
doctrine,
they
all
make
a
finding
of
employment.
counsel
says
that
the
tenth
circuit
harmonizes
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
fourth
circuit.
the
tenth
circuit
case
he
has
in
mind
is
hearson
versus
the
k-t
railroad.
it's
cited
in
the
briefs
in
it's
422
f.
2d.
the
court
finds
in
hearson,
hearson
was
an
employee
of
the
k-t.
in
other
words,
the
k-t
sold
its
car
cleaning
facilities
to
try
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
the
act.
but
they
kept
control
over
mr.
hearson
and
the
court
says
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he
sweeps
from
the
right
or
the
left.
the
point
is
the
railroad
still
maintained
the
necessary
control
and
because
they
did
that,
mr.
hearson
continued
to
be
an
employee.
now,
he
also
relies
and
he
just
cited
that
a
circuit
court
case,
byrne
versus
pennsylvania
railroad.
there,
you
had
westinghouse
engineer
whose
job
it
was
to
service
sophisticated
locomotives
after
they
were
sold
to
the
company,
the
railroad
company,
and
he
came
on
the
railroad
property,
and
he
worked
on
these
locomotives.
and
he
came
under
the
control
of
the
railroad
and
that
case
held,
he
was
a
joint
employee.
there
was
a
conventional
common
law
employment
relationship
that
developed
which
was
not
developed
in
the
case.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
he
work
there
for
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that
was
the
finding
sir.
the
conventional
finding
of
employment
which
is
not
in
this
case,
and
the
case
that's
relied
upon,
and
it's
from
the
fourth
circuit
is
unique
and
it's
different
in
that
it
is
the
only
case
that
does
not
find
employment.
now
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it's
hearson,
h-e-a-r-s-o-n
versus
missouri-kansas
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it's
in
counsel's
brief
i
believe
in
one
of
his
briefs.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it's
422
f.
2d,
1037.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
422
f.
2d,
1037.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it's
texas
railway
against
hearson.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
and
i
--
it's
m
k-t
versus
hearson.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
believe
so.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i'd
like
to
point
one
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
right.
i'd
like
to
point
out
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
if
we
may,
we'll
go
to
the
point.
counsel
says,
“this
is
a
case
where
the
appellate
court
sought
to
change
the
findings
to
reevaluate
them,
to
interpret
them.
”
they
didn't.
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
begins
and
ends
with
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
the
district
court
found
that
mr.
kelley
was
an
employee.
he
was
in
the
employment
of
the
pmt.
he
was
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that
finding
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
he
was
--
the
exercise
of
control
was
that
of
the
pacific
motor
trucking
company
in
his
root
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yeah.
the
responsibility
serve,
but
it
doesn't
say
the
control
was
in
the
southern
pacific
sir.
it
does
not
say
the
right
of
control
was
in
the
southern
pacific.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no.
could
i
explain
why?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
alright,
sir.
the
railroad
in
the
20th
century
became
--
become
a
very
sophisticated
operation.
we
have,
for
example,
computers
that
help
run
the
transportation
system.
we
have
sophisticated
telephone
systems.
we
don't
have
the
where
with
all
of
the
knowledge
to
run
these
computers,
but
we
have
the
responsibility
to
see
that
they
run
so
the
railroad
could
continue
running.
does
that
makes
all
the
ibm
employees
who
come
in
and
fix
those
computers,
railroad
employees
for
the
purposes
of
the
fela?
does
that
make
all
the
telephone
company
employees
for
the
purpose
of
the
fela?
these
are
employees
of
another
company.
and
counsel
acknowledged
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
we're
talking
about
a
subsidiary
company
or
some
other
company?
there
are
many
things
in
the
railroad
enterprise
that
have
to
be
done
by
others.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
we
have
a
responsibility
in
control
mr.
chief
justice
to
see
that
the
job
got
done,
that
was
to
see
that
railroad
cars
got
--
became
unloaded
under
the
tariff.
but
there's
a
difference,
it
seems
to
me
between
responsibility
to
see
that
the
result
gets
--
becomes
fact,
and
having
control
or
the
right
of
control.
you
can
hire
an
independent
contractor
and
that
doesn't
get
you
the
right
of
control.
we
don't
have
the
right
of
controlling
those
ibm
employees
when
they
come
into
fix
our
computers.
i'd
like
to
touch
on
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
best
thing
in
this
case
is
the
findings
of
the
district
judge
for
the
southern
pacific
company.
he
rejected
the
proposed
findings
of
the
petitioner
because
the
petitioner
requested
a
finding
that
the
southern
pacific
was
an
employer.
the
district
judge
knew
he
could
not
make
that
finding
because
the
evidence
wouldn't
support
it.
he
there
found
--
fore
found
that
employment
was
in
the
southern
pacific
company.
the
scope
of
coverage
of
an
fela
case
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
he
therefore
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
misspoke
myself.
i'm
very
sorry.
he
therefore
found
that
he
was
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
an
employee
of
the
pacific
motor
trucking
company.
i
want
to
touch
on
a
concept
that
this
court
has
developed
in
the
fela
field
and
it
has
to
do
with
non-delegable;
the
words
non-delegable.
the
concept
of
non-delegable
related
to
non-delegable
duties.
there
are
not
cases
of
this
court
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
there
are
two
concepts
that
though
that
i
wanted
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
there
are
two
concepts
so
that
i
think
it's
important.
it's
my
duty
to
make
clear.
one
deals
with
non-delegable.
non-delegable
refers
to
duty.
it
is
not
a
concept
developed
by
this
court
which
creates
employment.
once
you
have
employment
and
work
for
a
railroad
and
are
an
employee
of
a
railroad
as
all
the
cases
that
held
you
have
to
be
to
come
under
the
act,
then
the
railroad
has
a
non-delegable
duty
to
furnish
you
a
safe
place
to
work.
and
that
fact
that
you
send
your
railroad
employee
out
on
another
railroad
or
out
to
a
shipper's
premises
and
he
gives
an
unsafe
condition
there,
you
can't
say
as
a
railroad
but
we
don't
know
you
because
you
got
hurt
there.
no,
you
have
a
non-delegable
duty
and
that's
the
concept
in
which
non-delegable
came
up
and
the
district
court
became
confused
with
it.
now,
as
to
operational
activity,
that
concept
is
very
much
confused
by
the
smith
decision
in
the
fourth
circuit.
operational
activity
is
a
concept
which
protects
employees
who
are
in
fact
employed
by
railroad.
in
huston,
texas,
the
missouri
pacific
contracted
out
its
switching
business
and
they
had
an
employee
in
a
railroad
car
and
the
switching
company,
who
is
doing
their
operational
work
for
them,
ran
the
car
into
the
missouri
pacific
car
in
which
a
missouri
pacific
admitted
employee
was
standing
and
hurt
him
and
this
court
says,
“this
is
really
an
extension
of
an
agency
principle.
you
--
they
--
you
can't
let
someone
else
do
your
operational
work
and
then
deprive
your
own
employees
of
a
right
of
recovery
because
they
are
your
employees.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
i
think
this
raises
another
very
interesting
point
and
it's
this.
if
you
analyze
the
act
very
carefully,
you
see
that
there
are
three
classes
involved.
there's
a
plaintiff
class,
and
the
only
plaintiffs
that
come
under
that
act
and
can
recover
are
employees
of
common
carriers
by
railroad,
not
employees
of
agents
of
common
carriers
by
railroad.
this
court
in
1950
and
again,
in
1959
said,
this
term
employee
and
employed
is
not
used
in
any
special
sense.
it's
just
the
conventional,
whatever
the
conventional
meaning
of
the
word
employee
is.
and
if
to
be
an
employee,
you
have
to
be
in
someone's
employment
and
you
don't
get
to
be
an
employee
of
railroad
by
being
employed
by
an
agent
of
the
railroad.
”
this
court
made
that
very
clear
in
the
baker
case
in
1959.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
which
they
did
not
do
in
this
case.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
other
thing
--
the
other
class
is
the
class
of
carriers,
employers
into
the
act.
the
class
of
employers
are
common
carriers
by
railroad,
and
if
you
don't
work
for
railroad
for
the
simple
as
i
can
your
honors,
you
don't
come
on
to
the
act.
this
court
held
that
six
years
ago,
in
the
edwards
case.
you
have
to
work
for
a
railroad
or
you
don't
come
under
the
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i
can
explain
that.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
findings
in
the
low
number
pages
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
--
are
the
findings
as
signed
by
the
court.
the
ones
at
the
end
of
the
book
are
the
findings
as
proposed
by
the
petitioner
and
is
rejected
by
the
court.
the
petitioner
asked
to
have
the
court
find
that
his
client
worked
for
a
railroad,
petitioner's
attorney
asked
that,
and
the
court
says,
“no,
i
can't
find
it.”
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
he
doesn't
work
for
railroad.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no,
sir.
that
was
the
proposed
by
it.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that
was
the
proposed
findings.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
yes
sir?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
you
picked
a
very
unusual
fact
situation.
they
both
would
of
because
the
belt
railroad
is
also
a
common
carrier
by
railroad
and
it's
employ
--
he's
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
both
railroads,
if
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
both
railroad
--
here's
what
would
happen.
the
belt
railroad
was
negligent
and
if
it
hurt
one
of
its
employees,
it'd
be
liable
on
that
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
alright.
now
that
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
other
railroad
would
be
responsible
because
it
gave
up
an
operational
activity
to
the
belt
railroad
and
because
it
gave
up
an
operational
activity
to
the
belt
railroad,
it
cannot
escape
the
consequences
action,
to
its
own
employees
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
the
missouri
pacific
under
those
facts
would
be
liable
to
the
belt
railroad's
employees
who
are
injured
because
the
belt
railroad's
employees
were
not
under
their
control.
they
were
not
their
employees.
the
negligence
was
the
act
of
the
belt
railroad
and
not
the
missouri
pacific.
so,
the
missouri
pacific
would
only
be
liable
to
its
own
employees.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
i'm
sorry,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
only
for
purposes
--
only
be
--
and
i
was
about
to
get
to
that
and
i
think
i
can
explain
it
this
way
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
the
next
thing
i
want
to
come
to
that's
very
important.
i've
tried
to
describe
three
classes
that
come
under
this
act.
the
employee
class,
the
employer
class,
and
now
i'd
like
to
talk
about
the
third
class
which
i
think
relates
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white.
the
third
class
are
people
or
organizations
referred
to
in
the
act
are
the
people
or
organizations
for
whom
the
railroads
are
responsible;
officers,
agents
and
employees
of
railroads.
now
note,
the
word
agent
is
used
with
reference
to
those
people
for
whom
a
railroad
is
liable,
for
whose
conduct
they
are
liable.
the
word
agent
is
no
way
used
with
reference
to
the
employee
class.
it's
used
in
the
one
part
of
the
statute,
but
not
in
the
other.
there's
good
reason
for
that.
we've
quoted
the
legislative
history
here
quite
extensively.
it
was
relied
on
it
by
this
court
and
quoted
extensively
by
this
court
six
years
ago
in
edwards
versus
pacific
fruit
express
and
it
was
relied
on
specifically
by
the
circuit
court
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
legislative
history
is
very
clear
that
congress
did
not
want
teamsters
or
truck
companies
under
the
act.
so
i
think,
that
partially
explains
why
the
concept
of
agency
doesn't
relate
to
the
plaintiff
class.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir,
the
teamsters
union.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
some
motor
carrier
operating
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
in
nine
western
states.
there
has
been
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
the
pacific
motor
trucking
company.
they
are
paying
for
the
pension,
medical,
and
everything.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
what's
that
sir?
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
i'm
sure
the
pacific
motor
trucking
company
would
--
you've
asked
a
question
for
which
i
can't
find
any
legal
authority
one
way
or
another.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
and
i'm
sure
the
pacific
motor
trucking
company
would
work
your
honor
on
the
opposite,
for
the
opposite
result.
you
know,
there
are
something
else
about
this
case
that's
very
important,
and
it's
this.
because
railroads
have
been
around
a
long
time,
people
think
in
terms
that
they
should
be
able
to
do
everything
for
themselves
because
at
one
time,
they
did.
they
had
their
own
carpenters
a
hundred
years
ago,
their
own
plumbers,
their
own
sheet
metal
workers
and
everything,
but
we
don't
live
in
that
kind
of
world
anymore.
the
work
that
was
being
done
by
mr.
kelley
in
this
case
was
not
railroad
work,
it
was
teamsters'
work.
the
record
in
this
case,
specifically
the
testimony
of
mr.
cochins
shows
the
following
to
be
true
and
i
think
this
is
very
important.
this
trucking
company
was
organized
and
formed
in
the
early
1930's
and
about
1937,
they
built
highway
trailers,
the
truck
company,
the
pmt
to
carry
automobiles
along
the
roadway
in
trailers,
the
driveway
track
thing
you
see
and
the
pmt
employees
like
kelley
in
1937
loaded
and
unloaded
those
trailers.
about
1950,
the
railroads
started
what
was
known
as
piggy
back
service.
that
piggy
back
service
was
flat
cars
on
which
they
would
put
vans,
trucks.
and
little
later,
one
of
the
kinds
of
vans
or
trucks
they
put
on
the
railroad
cars
were
these
highway
trailers
that
carried
automobiles.
the
actual
truck
trailer
with
the
automobiles
on
it
was
tied
on
the
railroad
car
and
it
was
a
form
of
piggy
backing.
the
same
teamster
employees
who
were
performing
that
works
since
1937
performed
in
the
loading
and
unloading
on
the
railroad
cars;
the
loading
and
unloading.
then
in
the
early
60's,
the
railroad,
the
railroads
of
this
country
designed
what's
knows
as
bi-level
and
tri-level
cars
and
they
did
a
way
with
putting
the
trucks
--
the
autos
on
the
trucks
on
the
cars.
they
just
put
the
cars
on
train
--
on
the
railroad
cars
--
the
automobiles
on
the
railroad
cars,
but
the
significant
thing
is
this.
the
same
employees,
the
same
teamsters
like
kelley,
who
had
been
there
eight
years
doing
this
work
continued
to
do
the
work,
it
was
never
done
by
railroaders.
and
why
should
anyone
suppose
it
should
be
done
by
railroaders?
there's
a
lot
of
work
that
comes
under
a
railroad
carrier
that
is
not
railroad.
there
a
lot
of
peripheral
industries
that
work
with
a
railroad
and
their
activities
are
carried
under
a
tariff,
there
are
cases
on
our
brief
on
this,
but
they
are
not
railroading.
this
court
said
six
years
ago,
the
last
case
decided
on
the
question
of
coverage
under
the
act
was
edwards
versus
pacific
fruit
express.
this
court
said
there
a
lot
of
things
that
look
like
railroading,
but
they're
not
railroad.
in
the
edwards'
case,
that
company
owned
railroad,
switch
engines,
head
tracks,
move
box
cars,
own
cars,
did
switching
but
they
weren't
a
common
carrier
by
rail.
not
being
a
common
carrier
by
rail,
their
employees
couldn't
come
under
the
act.
so
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
no.
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
that
question
sir.
in
the
first
place,
we
have
to
look
at
it
in
the
context
that
contracting
out
to
avoid
the
act
would
be
bad.
if
you
were
avoiding
it
with
reference
to
your
obligations
to
your
own
employees
which
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir,
which
kelley
was
not
in
this
case.
we
always
have
to
start
there.
kelley
was
not
an
employee
of
the
railroad.
now,
contracting
out
that,
sir,
can
be
prevented
if
it's
evil,
if
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
if
it's
wrong,
i
don't
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be
in
contravention
of
section
5
contracting
out.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes.
if
it
is
and
i
don't
agree
that
it
is,
but
let's
assume
for
the
purpose
of
argument.
well,
no,
i
can't
agree
that
contracting
out
is
prohibited
by
the
act.
what's
prohibited
by
the
act
is
taking
a
release
from
an
employee
or
when
he
signs
up
for
employment,
i
promise
not
to
sue
you.
that's
what
section
5
is
all
about,
but
section
5
doesn't
deal
with
contracting
out.
but
you
see,
contracting
out
can
be
handled
by
other
laws
and
institutions,
not
by
an
improper
interpretation
contrary
to
legislative
intent
of
the
fela.
the
fela
said
--
that
congress
said
and
this
court
said
congress
said
it
six
years
ago,
“that
the
fela
only
applies
to
employees
of
railroads.
”
now
with
that
in
mind,
this
court
shouldn't
strain
to
worry
about
contracting
out
and
in
the
process,
improperly
interpret
the
fela
for
this
reason.
contracting
out
will
be
prevented
by
the
railway
labor
act
and
by
the
united
transportation
union.
if
the
railroad
decided,
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
contract
out
all
the
work
of
our
locomotive
engineers.
the
unions
would
file
a
section
6
notice
and
there
would
be
a
nationwide
strike
sooner
or
later,
and
they
couldn't
do
it.
so
i
think,
it's
so
highly
theoretical
and
to
worry
about
theoretical
things
like
that
and
interpret
the
act
where
it
shouldn't
go.
where
this
court
says
it
shouldn't
go
six
years
ago
would
be
wrong.
another
thing
i
want
to
point
out
to
you
about
contracting
out
why
it
wouldn't
work.
the
railroad
operations,
pick
a
train
moving
from
san
francisco
to
salt
lake
city
is
a
very
integrated
type
of
operation.
the
engineer
has
to
rely
on
the
conductor
for
his
signals
who
has
to
rely
on
the
brakeman,
who
has
to
rely
on
the
dispatcher,
who
has
to
rely
on
someone
else.
if
you
contracted
out
the
work
of
the
conductors
or
the
brakemen
or
the
engineer,
those
people
would
still
be
controlled
by
the
railroad
because
it's
still
so
integrated
and
this
court
wouldn't
have
any
trouble
finding
if
the
contracting
out
came
to
pass,
which
it
won't.
this
court
wouldn't
have
any
difficulty
finding,
the
railroad
still
maintaining
control.
the
conductor
is
still
telling
the
engineer
when
to
move,
the
train
dispatcher
still
telling
them
when
they
can
leave
the
station,
the
train
master
still
running
the
show,
there
is
still
requisite
control
and
supervision
over
these
employees
who
have
been
contracted
out.
so,
the
railroad
may
think
it's
contracting
them
out
but
this
court
would
hold
that
the
control
is
still
there,
the
control
that
is
not
in
the
kelley
case.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
well,
this
court
--
this
court
said
no
and
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
but
what
they
said
--
what
this
court
said
in
robinson
versus
baltimore
ohio
in
1915,
that
there
are
many
things
that
happen
on
the
railroad
that
are
not
really
railroading
in
the
sense
that
congress
intended
in
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it's
a
common
carrier
function
for
railroad
to
pull
a
pullman
car
and
they
are
still
pullman
cars,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes
sir,
and
didn't
come
under
the
act.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
that's
--
yes,
sir.
it
would
if,
if
the
congress
would
have
wanted
it
too,
but
congress
didn't
want
to
and
this
courts
said
they
didn't
want
to
in
the
robinson
case.
we
have
extensive
legislative
history
your
honor,
in
our
brief
and
this
court
holds
extensive
legislative
history
in
the
opinion,
in
the
edwards
case
which
i
keep
coming
back
to
by
justice
black.
this
court
relied
on
it
and
this
court
said
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
legislation
dealing
with
railroads
in
the
decade
of
the
30's,
wherein
congress
if
it
wanted
to,
could
have
included
other
people,
but
congress
specifically
excluded
other
people
and
they
specifically
excluded
teamsters.
then,
when
we
got
around
to
the
1939
amendment
of
the
fela,
congress
was
asked
to
include
trucking
companies
and
teamsters,
and
congress
said
no.
and
the
ninth
circuit
is
cognizant
of
that,
and
they
make
the
reference
to
the
report
--
the
report
in
their
opinion.
but
i
urge
upon
you
that
not
only
the
ninth
circuit
is
aware
of
it,
but
this
court
was
aware
of
it
and
this
court
relied
heavily
on
it
in
the
edwards
case.
i
want
to
allude
to
another
thing
that's
important.
there
is
no
particular
kind
of
railroad
activity
that
is
magic.
if
you're
doing
a
certain
kind
of
work,
you
must
be
a
railroader.
when
this
court
interpreted
the
1939
amendment
in
a
case
called
reed
versus
the
pennsylvania
railroad,
this
is
what
it
said.
the
railroad
was
all
upset
because
mrs.
reed
was
a
clerk
and
the
wind
that
blew
in
her
office
and
cut
her
on
the
face
and
they
said,
well
you're
not
a
railroader.
you
don't
have
the
suit
on
you
on
your
face,
and
cinders
in
your
hair,
and
calluses
on
your
hand.
you're
a
clerk.
you
can't
have
a
recovery
under
this
act
and
this
court
said
what
counts
is
in
order
to
come
under
the
act,
not
what
she
do.
you
can
be
a
clerk
and
come
under
this
act
and
since
that
opinion,
every
clerk
has
come
under
this
act.
what
counts
is
that
you
have
to
be
in
the
employment
of
a
railroad
which
and
doing
work
which
closely
or
substantially
effects
interstate
commerce.
mr.
kelley
was
not
in
the
employment
of
a
railroad.
it
was
specifically
had
so
held
by
the
trial
court.
i
think
that
for
whatever
reasons
there
is
a
direct
conflict,
and
there's
no
way
around
it
between
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit.
and
the
legislative
history
as
interpreted
by
this
court
and
the
decisions
in
robinson
of
this
court
and
baker
of
this
court,
clearly
indicate
that
the
fourth
circuit
is
an
error
in
that
one
case.
there's
only
one
case,
it's
smith
versus
norfolk
&
western,
in
which
they
said,
“we
find
that
mr.
smith
is
not
an
employee
of
a
railroad.
but,
it
doesn't
matter
to
us.
he
is
an
employee
of
an
agent
of
a
railroad.
”
and
the
ninth
circuit
recognizes,
this
supreme
court
has
recognized
on
many
occasions,
that
isn't
enough.
you
have
to
be
an
employee.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
it
was
on
50%
by
the
southern
pacific
transportation
company
and
50%
by
the
union
pacific
railroad
company.
but
again
--
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
yes,
i
like
that
case,
judge,
your
honor.
[attempt
to
laughter]
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
j.
corrigan
your
honor,
it
was
[attempt
to
laughter]
there's
one
other
thing.
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
was
not
asked
to
decide
questions
of
law
only.
this
was
a
bifurcated
trial.
he
was
the
fact
finder.
thank
you
very
much
for
the
time
and
privilege
of
being
here
