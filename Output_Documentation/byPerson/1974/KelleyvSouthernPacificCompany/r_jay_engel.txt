mr.
r.
jay
engel
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
ostensibly
the
issue
that
is
appearing
before
your
honors
is
whether
this
court
should
set
new
guidelines
for
determining
employee
status
under
the
fela
or
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
southern
pacific
company
was
successful
in
maintaining
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
district
court
had
applied
a
new
legal
theory
in
creating
employee
status
under
the
fela.
this
new
legal
theory
purportedly
comes
from
the
fourth
circuit
in
a
case
called
smith
versus
norfolk.
petitioner
not
only
disagrees
with
southern
pacific's
contention
as
to
what
the
theory
or
legal
theory
is
that
is
set
forth
in
smith,
but
further
petitioner
believes
that
there
is
a
threshold
issue
here
that
is
not
been
briefed
nor
argued
either
by
the
ninth
circuit
nor
by
southern
pacific
company.
contrary
to
southern
pacific
company's
analysis,
both
the
trial
court,
the
district
court
and
both
parties
recognized
that
a
factual
question
was
being
submitted
and
that
the
court
was
going
to
render
a
factual
conclusion
as
opposed
to
a
legal
conclusion
because
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
consider
this
issue
and
did
not
consider
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
or
district
court
was
in
fact
rendering
a
factual
conclusion.
the
ninth
circuit
simply
ignored
the
issues
with
regard
to
the
limitations
on
its
appellate
review
power
in
a
appellate
court
or
a
circuit
court
reviewing
a
factual
determination
by
the
district
court.
i
suggest
that
what's
at
the
heart
of
this
matter
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
desires
to
have
this
court
postulate
a
new
theory,
a
new
theory
with
regard
to
a
determining
employee
status.
and
to
accomplish
this,
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
is,
it
selected
a
single
fact
or
finding
by
the
district
court
and
it
singled
out
a
single
authority
that
was
relied
on
by
the
trial
court
or
the
ninth
circuit
and
then
ignored
all
the
other
findings,
and
it
ignored
all
the
other
authorities
that
were
relied
on
by
the
district
court.
now
the
reason
i
suggest
that
this
court
is
before
or
this
case
is
before
this
court
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
fail
to
recognized
its
--
the
factual
consideration
was
rendered
by
the
district
court
and
that
the
ninth
circuit's
appropriate
appellate
review
power
was
to
deal
with
it
as
a
factual
conclusion
and
to
uphold
the
district
court's
decision.
the
tenth
circuit
in
a
very
similar
type
of
case,
the
missouri
kansas
versus
hearson
harmonized
and
set
forth
both
the
smith
decision
and
the
ninth
circuit
decisions
as
authority
for
a
single
proposition.
the
tenth
circuit
had
no
problem
at
all
recognizing
that
smith
versus
norfolk
did
not
set
forth
a
new
legal
theory.
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
analysis
that
the
tenth
circuit
may
in
the
missouri-kansas
versus
hearson
decision
is
a
correct
analysis
of
the
smith
decision
and
is
the
same
analysis
that
the
district
court
made
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
result
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
matter
is
that
it
is
the
only
appellate
decision
which
has
overturned
a
district
court's
factual
conclusion
as
to
what
constitutes
an
employee
under
the
fela.
their
decisions
both
ways
in
the
district
courts,
where
district
courts
have
rendered
conclusions
that
a
person
was
not
an
employee
and
there
are
decisions
where
the
district
court
has
concluded
that
a
person
employed
by
an
independent
contractor
was
an
employee.
and
the
ninth
circuit
review
is
the
only
decision
where
those
type
of
preliminary
factual
conclusions
were
made
by
district
court
has
been
overturned.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
your
honor.
that
would
not
be
my
intent
in
making
that
decision.
i
recognize
that
that
is
rather
a
strong
statement
and
certainly
could
be
interpreted
in
the
[attempt
to
laughter]
manner
that,
your
honor
is
suggesting.
i
think
that
court
was
trying
in
all
good
faith
to
render
a
very
appropriate
decision.
but
i
think
that
what
the
court
did
come
up
with
was
an
obvious
conflict
in
the
decision
--
in
the
circuits
when
in
fact,
the
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
ninth
circuit
was
whether
a
factual
determination
had
been
made
by
the
district
court.
so
then
when
i
say,
they
intentionally
made
a
conflict,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
they
were
aware
that
they
were
creating
a
conflict
and
that
that
did
not
cause
them
--
it
did
not
cause
him
to
follow
the
fourth
circuit
is
what
it
amounted
to.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
actually
what
i'm
saying
is
that
they
misinterpreted
the
fourth
circuit.
they
thought
they
were
creating
a
conflict.
the
fourth
circuit
decision
in
smith
versus
norfolk
as
the
tenth
circuit
has
recognized
is
not
a
new
legal
theory.
it
is
consistent
with
all
the
other
circuits.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
and
all
the
circuits
agreed
with
that.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
the
reasoning
that
the
tenth
circuit
made
in
that
regard
in
citing
the
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit
as
well
as
fourth
circuit
harmonizes
the
--
all
the
circuits
into
one
consistent
viewpoint,
and
that
is
that
we
have
a
factual
determination
to
be
made
by
the
trial
court
along
the
guidelines
of
the
restatement
section
220
and
that
the
district
court
in
this
matter,
that
is
precisely
what
it
attempted
to
do.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
the
ninth
circuit
decision
as
its
stand
now
creates
a
conflict
because
they
misinterpreted
or
misread
in
my
judgment
the
fourth
circuit
opinion.
in
other
words,
they
have
placed
a
legal
interpretation
on
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
and
they
are
saying
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
we
are
ruling
to
the
contrary
so
there
is
a
conflict.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
when
you
go
under
the
surface
of
it
and
examine
the
fourth
circuit
decision,
it
is
not
in
conflict
with
any
the
other
circuits.
and
the
only
decision
now
that
is
in
conflict
with
the
other
circuits
is
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
case
at
bar
because
it
is
the
only
appellate
decision
that
is
overturned
a
district
court's
factual
conclusion
on
employee
status.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
your
honor.
that
finding
--
but
it
provides
or
how
i
read
it
is
that
the
court
was
concluding
that
it
was
the
nature
of
the
work
that
the
plaintiff
was
performing
that
brought
him
within
the
coverage
of
the
fela,
that
the
plaintiff
was
doing
a
non-delegable
duty
or
a
--
and
was
performing
work
in
the
services
of
the
railroad
which
is
the
definition
that
the
restatement
uses
for
determining
who
an
employee
belongs
to
at
the
time
of
a
particular
act.
and
the
trial
court
here,
the
district
court
was
concluding
that
the
plaintiff
was
fulfilling
work
of
southern
pacific
company
and
it
was
because
of
that,
that
the
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
the
coverage
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
with
the
ninth
--
with
the
ninth
circuit
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
your
honor.
i
drew
--
i
propose
some.
the
court
changed
a
number
of
them.
most
of
mine
were
broken
down
more
singularly
and
it
combined
its
findings
and
made
it
a
shorter
set
of
findings.
what
did
ninth
circuit
did,
it
did
not
comment
on
that
finding,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
picked
out
the
fourth
conclusion
of
fact
or
finding
a
fact
by
the
district
court
where
the
court
concluded
that
pacific
motor
trucking
company
was
an
agent
of
southern
pacific
company.
but
the
ninth
circuit
ignored
the
finding
number
9
which
concluded
as
a
factual
basis
that
the
type
of
work
that
the
plaintiff
was
doing
brought
him
within
the
fela.
in
other
words,
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
it
said,
“the
district
court
found
that
pacific
motor
trucking
company
was
an
agent
of
southern
pacific
company,
and
therefore,
there
was
fela
coverage.
”
that
is
not
what
the
finding
show.
the
finding
with
regard
to
the
agency
for
the
trucking
company
is
in
number
4,
but
the
finding
that
the
court
used
to
support
the
fela
coverage
is
number
9,
where
it
says,
“the
plaintiff
was
fulfilling
a
non-delegable
duty
at
the
defendant
southern
pacific
company
which
brought
the
plaintiff
within
the
traditional
agency
relationship
and
in
such
a
relationship
to
the
defendant
southern
pacific
company.”
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
there
are
combinations
your
honor.
some
of
them
are
motions
for
summary
judgment
that
went
up
on
appeal
which
of
course
were
decided
by
a
court
or
a
judge
and
some
of
them
are
jury
conclusions
at
the
time
of
trial.
i
don't
know
of
another
case
dealing
either
with
fela
law
or
i
couldn't
find
another
case
where
you
had
a
situation
where
the
parties
agreed
to
waive
a
jury
as
to
the
limited
issue
and
submitted
that
factual
question
to
the
court
for
determination
as
we
did
here.
we
were
then
going
to
proceed
with
the
question
of
negligence
and
damages
to
a
jury.
but
it
was
well
understood
at
the
time
of
trial
that
this
limited
issue
was
--
we're
waiting
a
jury
as
to
that
one
limited
factual
question
and
that
factual
question
was
going
to
be
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
your
honor.
there
are,
in
fact,
there
--
i
should
have
cited
it
to
the
court.
there
is
a
decision
where
that
issue
was
raised
in
an
fela
situation,
and
i'm
--
well,
i'm
not
that
confident
about
the
court
nor
the
ruling,
my
recollection
was
that
the
court
concluded,
i
think
it
was
a
circuit
court
that
because
somebody
had
applied
for
workman's
compensation
benefits
that
that
was
not
a
factor
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
was
entitled
to
fela
coverage.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
while
this
is
not
within
the
preview
of
this
appeal,
i
would
anticipate
that
in
any
event
this
court
rules
in
favor
of
petitioner
that
what
will
happen
is
southern
pacific
will
then
stop
the
workman's
compensation
benefits
and
we
will
litigate
that
issue
as
to
whether
or
not,
that's
appropriate
or
not.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
i'm
sorry.
i
used
them
interchangeably.
i
--
it
is.
i'm
suggesting
that
pacific
motor
trucking
company
will
stop
the
workman's
compensation
benefits,
and
we
will
then
litigate
that
issue.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
there
is
not
in
this
case.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
i
think
it's
going
to
be
complex
your
honor
because
that
is
a
state
right
under
state
statute,
and
the
rights
under
the
fela
are
not
state
oriented
by
federal
oriented,
and
the
question
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
well,
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
i'd,
of
course,
i'd
like
to
say
to
you
because
in
a
no
double
recoveries
are
not
something
that
it
desired
by
any
court
that
know
that
won't
happen.
but
i
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
your
honor,
i
anticipate
that
when
pacific
motor
trucking
company
stops
the
payments,
that
i
would
go
to
the
law
books
and
see
what
i
can
do
for
mr.
kelley
to
see
if
he
is
not
entitled
to
both.
but
i
can't
tell
your
honor
what
i
would
anticipate
the
result
of
that
would
be.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
the
impact
that
i
find
in
that
finding
is
that
he
was
characterizing
the
work
that
was
being
done
by
mr.
kelley
as
being
performing
in
the
services
of
the
railroad.
i
don't
think
that
his
finding
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
any
time,
an
individual
is
performing
a
certain
type
of
work
that
they
are
necessarily
an
employee
“within
the
fela.
”
in
other
words,
each
would
still
have
to
be
determined
on
the
facts
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
smith
case
nor
in
the
district
court's
decision
here,
where
that
you
could
anticipate
that
every
time,
an
individual
who
fell
from
a
tri-level
railroad
car
would
necessarily
be
entitled
to
fela
coverage.
it
would
be
determined
factually
in
that
given
case
at
that
given
time.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
he
found
that
to
be
true.
there
were
some
particular
facts
in
this
given
case
which
in
my
opinion
caused
him
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
there
was
difference
of
opinion
in
the
briefs
with
regard
for
example,
whether
this
work
was
within
the
tariff
of
the
railroad.
the
work
of
unloading,
the
tri-level
railroad
car
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
within
the
tariff
for
the
railroad.
it
was
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes
--
no
but
no
yes.
in
this
case
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
what
i'm
saying
in
this
case
that
is
true,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
in
the
next
person
who
is
working
on
a
tri-level
railroad
car
and
falls
off.
in
that
instance,
the
railroad
may
not
have
within
its
tariff
the
unloading
of
the
automobiles,
that
would
be
a
significant
fact
that
would
be
different.
so
that
there
are
differences
in
fact
in
each
case
and
i
think
what
the
district
court
did
here
is
that
in
this
particular
case,
he
concluded
that
southern
pacific
company
in
this
particular
case
had
a
non-delegable
duty.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
sinkler
was
a
case
involving
determination
of
the
defendant
class
as
opposed
to
the
plaintiff
class.
i
think
it
has
application
in
that
both
in
sinkler
where
they
were
determining
the
defendant
class,
in
other
words,
who
are
the
employers
that
can
sued?
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
because
sinkler
dealt
with
in
determining
the
defendant.
in
other
words,
it
was
the
defendant
and
employer
who
could
be
sued.
in
our
instance,
we're
talking
about
is
the
injured
party
an
employee
that
can
sue
an
employer,
an
identified
employer,
but
they
are
very
similar
in
that
both
cases,
both
the
baker
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
that's
right.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
correct.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
we're
going
back
the
other
way.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
and
but
there
is
a
similarity
in
that
both
cases
turn
on.
what
was
the
nature
of
the
work
that
the
party
involved
was
doing
at
the
time?
that
determine
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
correct.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
let's
say
it
was
so
found.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
that's
correct.
and
there
was
some
dispute
to
that
the
time
of
trial
and
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
or
not
that
tariff
was
actually
covered
the
unloading
operation
and
your
honors,
will
note
that
we
have
attached
a
copy
to
our
brief
of
the
interrogatory
where
we
had
taken
the
deposition
of
one
of
the
s.p.
superiors
who
said
that
he
thought
it
was
an
alternative
tariff
situation
that
some
shippers
could
and
some
shippers
would
not
be
charged
that
tariff.
but
in
fact,
when
an
interrogatory
was
submitted
to
southern
pacific
company,
they
specified
that

the
appendix,
yes
your
honor.
that's
pages
roman
numeral
xii
through
xv.
the
question
is
--
begins
at
xii
and
the
answer
is
on
xv,
roman
numeral
xv
at
the
end.
mr.
r.
jay

oh,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
speaking
the
petitioner.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
i
do
believe
it's
attached
to
the
brief
your
honor.
i
do
have
an
attached
to
the
petition
there.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
in
the
absence
of
any
further
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
i
don't'
that
would
make
difference.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
this
particular
individual.
in
other
words,
rather
than
the
employer,
in
other
words,
just
because
pacific
motor
trucking
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
right.
he
was
doing
a
particular
act
and
that
particular
act
because
of
the
nature
of
that
act
was
with
--
was
actually
performing
the
services
of
southern
pacific
company
and
consequently,
he
is
entitled
to
fela
coverage.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
i
would
say
he
could,
but
not
necessarily.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
any
of
these
cases
turn
in
one
particular
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
and
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
correct.
but
the
respondents
here
want
to
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
there's
one
that's
very
similar
to
that,
where
westinghouse
sold
an
engine
to
a
railroad
and
the
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
the
ninth
circuit
did.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
i
recognize
that,
your
honor.
i
disagree
profusely
with
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
and
the
ninth
circuit
is
saying
that
fourth
circuit
created
a
new
theory
and
we're
saying
that
that's
not
accurate,
and
the
evidence
of
that
is
the
tenth
circuit
harmonized
both
districts
didn't
have
any
problems.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
correct.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
he
was
also
injured
while
he
was
just
getting
the
automobile's
prepared
to
load.
he
wasn't
--
they
didn't
even
started
actually
driving
the
automobiles
off
the
railroad
car.
the
process,
where
he
has
injured
was
going
along
and
unhooking
the
chains
underneath
so
that
and
each
of
these
facts
can
be
important,
and
i
think
it
would
under
the
baker
decision,
the
test
is
that
district
court
at
that
particular
time
weighing
all
of
these
facts
what
conclusion
they
come
up
with.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
your
honor,
the
citation
that
i
referred
to
is
bryne
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
company.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
it's
262
f.
2d
906.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no.
it
was
--
certiorari
was
denied
here
but
it's
a
circuit
opinion.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
and
i've
asked
that
few
minutes
could
be
saved
to
i
think
for
rebuttal.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
briefly,
your
honors.
the
conclusion
of
law
that
i
proposed
to
the
trial
court
was
a
conclusion
of
law
which
the
court
can
find
at
page
163
of
the
index
where
i
stated
that
mr.
kelley
was
a
quote
“employee”
of
the
defendant
southern
pacific.
the
trial
court
did
not
reject
a
fact
finding
of
employment
and
what
the
trial
court
did
is
a
rejected
by
use
of
term
“employee.”
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
there
were
some
that
he
did
reject
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
i
think
he
did
encompass
my
fact
finding
to
in
his
fact
finding
aid.
there
were
several
of
them
that
were
combined
up
by,
and
one
of
them
in
his
--
specifically
says,
they
had
the
responsibility
and
control.
i
think
it's
rather
clear
that
he
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
they
had
the
control.
and
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well
your
honor,
he
rejected
my
use
of
putting
“employee”
in
quotes
as
a
conclusion
of
law.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
and
what
he
did
though
your
honor
is
that
change
the
language
of
my
conclusion
of
law
and
added
a
fact
that
i
or
fact
--
a
conclusion
of
fact
that
i
had
not
proposed,
and
that
was
his
proposed
or
his
finding
number
9,
which
specific
and
i
had
not
offered
that.
it
says
the
work
being
performed
by
the
plaintiff
and
this
is
the
finding
that
brings
the
plaintiff
within
the
relationship
to
southern
pacific
company
because
of
the
nature
of
work
he
was
doing.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
your
honor
and
because
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
he
rejected
my
conclusion
of
law
where
the
term
employee
was
used,
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
but
in
--
but
in
baker
versus
texas
which
is
a
test,
and
this
--
what
is
being
argued
here
is
that
southern
pacific
company
wants
this
court
now
to
go
back
and
rephrase
or
reword
or
change
baker
versus
texas
wherein
this
court
at
that
time
and
what
is
been
the
rule
for
about
many
years
now
that
you
make
a
factual
determination
as
to
whether
the
person
is
an
employee
as
that
term
is
used
within
the
fela.
it
is
not
that
you
make
a
factual
determination
that
the
person
in
fact
is
an
employee;
it's
a
matter
of
creating
a
class
of
individuals
on
an
individual
case
basis
as
to
whether
an
individual
fits
within
the
coverage
of
the
fela.
and
what
we
are
doing
here
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
do
and
that
was
to
recognize
that
it's
a
factual
conclusion
and
a
factual
determination
for
the
district
court
to
make,
and
what
is
happening
is
what
is
happening
here.
each
case
now
will
be
re-argued
in
re-argued
because
there
is
no
rule
coming
from
this
court
as
to
a
guideline
whereby
the
district
court's
can
use.
this
court
has
set
down
that
guideline
in
baker
and
it
says
it's
a
factual
determination
of
each
judge
to
do
in
each
individual
case.
and
that's
the
rule
that
they're
challenging.
they
want
this
to
have
to
be
a
matter
of
the
law
to
take
away
from
the
district
courts
the
ability
to
make
a
factual
determination.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
in
quotes,
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
because
baker
versus
texas,
it
said
it's
a
factual
determination
depending
on
what
the
work
that
was
being
performed
at
the
time
of
a
given
injury.
and
what
the
court
has
done
in
its
factual
conclusion
here
is
characterized
the
kind
of
work
that
was
being
done
that
supported
the
court's
conclusion
that
he
was
entitled
to
recovery.
rather
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
that's
correct.
he
chose
to
characterize
it
by
the
nature
of
the
work
as
suppose
do
a
label
is
to
whether
he
is
employee
or
agent
or
borrowed
servant
or
whatever,
he
characterized
by
the
nature
of
work
that
mr.
kelley
was
doing.
and
because
of
the
nature
of
work
that
he
was
doing,
he
was
entitled
to
fela
coverage,
and
that
has
been
the
standard
test
this
court
has
promulgated
since
baker
and
long
before
back
in
1927
with
regard
to
the
doctrine
of
borrowed
servant.
it
was
the
nature
of
work
the
individual
is
doing.
what
southern
pacific
wants
to
do
is
to
eliminate
the
whole
concept
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
why
he
chose
to
characterize
it
by
the
nature
of
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
all
i
know
is
that
he
chose
to
characterize
it
by
the
nature
of
work.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well
he
is
certainly,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
judge
is
cognizant
of
what
the
statute
reads
and
he
has
cited
the
statute
in
his
conclusions
of
law.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
that's
how
southern
pacific
characterizes
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
what
i'm
saying
is
that
what
smith
said
and
what
the
district
court
here
said
is
that
depending
on
the
type
of
work
that
the
person
was
doing
as
in
smith
that
he
does
fall
within
the
fela
and
smith
recognized
that
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
and
there
is
no
--the
history
of
having
employees
of
independent
contractors
covered
by
the
fela
is
not
a
new
concept
and
that's
what
they
wish
to
abolish.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
the
restatement
sets
down
some
13
factors
anyone
of
which
can
be
controlling
and
no
one
of
which
is
controlling
and
one
them
is
that
what
the
parties
understand
the
relationship
whether
he
thinks
regarding
who
he
thinks
is
employed
by
or
who
they
think
is
their
employee.
but
that
is
only
one
factor
that
this
court
is
previously
said
should
be
used
by
the
court
as
a
guideline
and
i
think
of
particular
interest
if
you
will,
in
my
brief,
i
show
how
the
district
court
went
down
and
made
its
findings
to
almost
correlate
precisely
with
the
restatement
test
which
is
the
test
that
they
wish
to
abolish.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
ostensibly
the
issue
that
is
appearing
before
your
honors
is
whether
this
court
should
set
new
guidelines
for
determining
employee
status
under
the
fela
or
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
southern
pacific
company
was
successful
in
maintaining
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
district
court
had
applied
a
new
legal
theory
in
creating
employee
status
under
the
fela.
this
new
legal
theory
purportedly
comes
from
the
fourth
circuit
in
a
case
called
smith
versus
norfolk.
petitioner
not
only
disagrees
with
southern
pacific's
contention
as
to
what
the
theory
or
legal
theory
is
that
is
set
forth
in
smith,
but
further
petitioner
believes
that
there
is
a
threshold
issue
here
that
is
not
been
briefed
nor
argued
either
by
the
ninth
circuit
nor
by
southern
pacific
company.
contrary
to
southern
pacific
company's
analysis,
both
the
trial
court,
the
district
court
and
both
parties
recognized
that
a
factual
question
was
being
submitted
and
that
the
court
was
going
to
render
a
factual
conclusion
as
opposed
to
a
legal
conclusion
because
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
consider
this
issue
and
did
not
consider
whether
or
not
the
trial
court
or
district
court
was
in
fact
rendering
a
factual
conclusion.
the
ninth
circuit
simply
ignored
the
issues
with
regard
to
the
limitations
on
its
appellate
review
power
in
a
appellate
court
or
a
circuit
court
reviewing
a
factual
determination
by
the
district
court.
i
suggest
that
what's
at
the
heart
of
this
matter
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
desires
to
have
this
court
postulate
a
new
theory,
a
new
theory
with
regard
to
a
determining
employee
status.
and
to
accomplish
this,
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
is,
it
selected
a
single
fact
or
finding
by
the
district
court
and
it
singled
out
a
single
authority
that
was
relied
on
by
the
trial
court
or
the
ninth
circuit
and
then
ignored
all
the
other
findings,
and
it
ignored
all
the
other
authorities
that
were
relied
on
by
the
district
court.
now
the
reason
i
suggest
that
this
court
is
before
or
this
case
is
before
this
court
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
fail
to
recognized
its
--
the
factual
consideration
was
rendered
by
the
district
court
and
that
the
ninth
circuit's
appropriate
appellate
review
power
was
to
deal
with
it
as
a
factual
conclusion
and
to
uphold
the
district
court's
decision.
the
tenth
circuit
in
a
very
similar
type
of
case,
the
missouri
kansas
versus
hearson
harmonized
and
set
forth
both
the
smith
decision
and
the
ninth
circuit
decisions
as
authority
for
a
single
proposition.
the
tenth
circuit
had
no
problem
at
all
recognizing
that
smith
versus
norfolk
did
not
set
forth
a
new
legal
theory.
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
analysis
that
the
tenth
circuit
may
in
the
missouri-kansas
versus
hearson
decision
is
a
correct
analysis
of
the
smith
decision
and
is
the
same
analysis
that
the
district
court
made
in
the
case
at
bar.
the
result
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
matter
is
that
it
is
the
only
appellate
decision
which
has
overturned
a
district
court's
factual
conclusion
as
to
what
constitutes
an
employee
under
the
fela.
their
decisions
both
ways
in
the
district
courts,
where
district
courts
have
rendered
conclusions
that
a
person
was
not
an
employee
and
there
are
decisions
where
the
district
court
has
concluded
that
a
person
employed
by
an
independent
contractor
was
an
employee.
and
the
ninth
circuit
review
is
the
only
decision
where
those
type
of
preliminary
factual
conclusions
were
made
by
district
court
has
been
overturned.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
your
honor.
that
would
not
be
my
intent
in
making
that
decision.
i
recognize
that
that
is
rather
a
strong
statement
and
certainly
could
be
interpreted
in
the
[attempt
to
laughter]
manner
that,
your
honor
is
suggesting.
i
think
that
court
was
trying
in
all
good
faith
to
render
a
very
appropriate
decision.
but
i
think
that
what
the
court
did
come
up
with
was
an
obvious
conflict
in
the
decision
--
in
the
circuits
when
in
fact,
the
issue
that
was
presented
to
the
ninth
circuit
was
whether
a
factual
determination
had
been
made
by
the
district
court.
so
then
when
i
say,
they
intentionally
made
a
conflict,
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
they
were
aware
that
they
were
creating
a
conflict
and
that
that
did
not
cause
them
--
it
did
not
cause
him
to
follow
the
fourth
circuit
is
what
it
amounted
to.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
actually
what
i'm
saying
is
that
they
misinterpreted
the
fourth
circuit.
they
thought
they
were
creating
a
conflict.
the
fourth
circuit
decision
in
smith
versus
norfolk
as
the
tenth
circuit
has
recognized
is
not
a
new
legal
theory.
it
is
consistent
with
all
the
other
circuits.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
and
all
the
circuits
agreed
with
that.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
the
reasoning
that
the
tenth
circuit
made
in
that
regard
in
citing
the
cases
in
the
ninth
circuit
as
well
as
fourth
circuit
harmonizes
the
--
all
the
circuits
into
one
consistent
viewpoint,
and
that
is
that
we
have
a
factual
determination
to
be
made
by
the
trial
court
along
the
guidelines
of
the
restatement
section
220
and
that
the
district
court
in
this
matter,
that
is
precisely
what
it
attempted
to
do.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
the
ninth
circuit
decision
as
its
stand
now
creates
a
conflict
because
they
misinterpreted
or
misread
in
my
judgment
the
fourth
circuit
opinion.
in
other
words,
they
have
placed
a
legal
interpretation
on
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
and
they
are
saying
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
we
are
ruling
to
the
contrary
so
there
is
a
conflict.
but
i'm
suggesting
that
when
you
go
under
the
surface
of
it
and
examine
the
fourth
circuit
decision,
it
is
not
in
conflict
with
any
the
other
circuits.
and
the
only
decision
now
that
is
in
conflict
with
the
other
circuits
is
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
case
at
bar
because
it
is
the
only
appellate
decision
that
is
overturned
a
district
court's
factual
conclusion
on
employee
status.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
your
honor.
that
finding
--
but
it
provides
or
how
i
read
it
is
that
the
court
was
concluding
that
it
was
the
nature
of
the
work
that
the
plaintiff
was
performing
that
brought
him
within
the
coverage
of
the
fela,
that
the
plaintiff
was
doing
a
non-delegable
duty
or
a
--
and
was
performing
work
in
the
services
of
the
railroad
which
is
the
definition
that
the
restatement
uses
for
determining
who
an
employee
belongs
to
at
the
time
of
a
particular
act.
and
the
trial
court
here,
the
district
court
was
concluding
that
the
plaintiff
was
fulfilling
work
of
southern
pacific
company
and
it
was
because
of
that,
that
the
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
the
coverage
of
the
federal
employers'
liability
act.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
with
the
ninth
--
with
the
ninth
circuit
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
your
honor.
i
drew
--
i
propose
some.
the
court
changed
a
number
of
them.
most
of
mine
were
broken
down
more
singularly
and
it
combined
its
findings
and
made
it
a
shorter
set
of
findings.
what
did
ninth
circuit
did,
it
did
not
comment
on
that
finding,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
picked
out
the
fourth
conclusion
of
fact
or
finding
a
fact
by
the
district
court
where
the
court
concluded
that
pacific
motor
trucking
company
was
an
agent
of
southern
pacific
company.
but
the
ninth
circuit
ignored
the
finding
number
9
which
concluded
as
a
factual
basis
that
the
type
of
work
that
the
plaintiff
was
doing
brought
him
within
the
fela.
in
other
words,
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
it
said,
“the
district
court
found
that
pacific
motor
trucking
company
was
an
agent
of
southern
pacific
company,
and
therefore,
there
was
fela
coverage.
”
that
is
not
what
the
finding
show.
the
finding
with
regard
to
the
agency
for
the
trucking
company
is
in
number
4,
but
the
finding
that
the
court
used
to
support
the
fela
coverage
is
number
9,
where
it
says,
“the
plaintiff
was
fulfilling
a
non-delegable
duty
at
the
defendant
southern
pacific
company
which
brought
the
plaintiff
within
the
traditional
agency
relationship
and
in
such
a
relationship
to
the
defendant
southern
pacific
company.”
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
there
are
combinations
your
honor.
some
of
them
are
motions
for
summary
judgment
that
went
up
on
appeal
which
of
course
were
decided
by
a
court
or
a
judge
and
some
of
them
are
jury
conclusions
at
the
time
of
trial.
i
don't
know
of
another
case
dealing
either
with
fela
law
or
i
couldn't
find
another
case
where
you
had
a
situation
where
the
parties
agreed
to
waive
a
jury
as
to
the
limited
issue
and
submitted
that
factual
question
to
the
court
for
determination
as
we
did
here.
we
were
then
going
to
proceed
with
the
question
of
negligence
and
damages
to
a
jury.
but
it
was
well
understood
at
the
time
of
trial
that
this
limited
issue
was
--
we're
waiting
a
jury
as
to
that
one
limited
factual
question
and
that
factual
question
was
going
to
be
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
your
honor.
there
are,
in
fact,
there
--
i
should
have
cited
it
to
the
court.
there
is
a
decision
where
that
issue
was
raised
in
an
fela
situation,
and
i'm
--
well,
i'm
not
that
confident
about
the
court
nor
the
ruling,
my
recollection
was
that
the
court
concluded,
i
think
it
was
a
circuit
court
that
because
somebody
had
applied
for
workman's
compensation
benefits
that
that
was
not
a
factor
in
determining
whether
or
not
he
was
entitled
to
fela
coverage.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
while
this
is
not
within
the
preview
of
this
appeal,
i
would
anticipate
that
in
any
event
this
court
rules
in
favor
of
petitioner
that
what
will
happen
is
southern
pacific
will
then
stop
the
workman's
compensation
benefits
and
we
will
litigate
that
issue
as
to
whether
or
not,
that's
appropriate
or
not.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
i'm
sorry.
i
used
them
interchangeably.
i
--
it
is.
i'm
suggesting
that
pacific
motor
trucking
company
will
stop
the
workman's
compensation
benefits,
and
we
will
then
litigate
that
issue.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
there
is
not
in
this
case.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
i
think
it's
going
to
be
complex
your
honor
because
that
is
a
state
right
under
state
statute,
and
the
rights
under
the
fela
are
not
state
oriented
by
federal
oriented,
and
the
question
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
well,
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor.
i'd,
of
course,
i'd
like
to
say
to
you
because
in
a
no
double
recoveries
are
not
something
that
it
desired
by
any
court
that
know
that
won't
happen.
but
i
to
be
perfectly
candid
with
your
honor,
i
anticipate
that
when
pacific
motor
trucking
company
stops
the
payments,
that
i
would
go
to
the
law
books
and
see
what
i
can
do
for
mr.
kelley
to
see
if
he
is
not
entitled
to
both.
but
i
can't
tell
your
honor
what
i
would
anticipate
the
result
of
that
would
be.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
the
impact
that
i
find
in
that
finding
is
that
he
was
characterizing
the
work
that
was
being
done
by
mr.
kelley
as
being
performing
in
the
services
of
the
railroad.
i
don't
think
that
his
finding
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
any
time,
an
individual
is
performing
a
certain
type
of
work
that
they
are
necessarily
an
employee
“within
the
fela.
”
in
other
words,
each
would
still
have
to
be
determined
on
the
facts
and
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
smith
case
nor
in
the
district
court's
decision
here,
where
that
you
could
anticipate
that
every
time,
an
individual
who
fell
from
a
tri-level
railroad
car
would
necessarily
be
entitled
to
fela
coverage.
it
would
be
determined
factually
in
that
given
case
at
that
given
time.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
he
found
that
to
be
true.
there
were
some
particular
facts
in
this
given
case
which
in
my
opinion
caused
him
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
there
was
difference
of
opinion
in
the
briefs
with
regard
for
example,
whether
this
work
was
within
the
tariff
of
the
railroad.
the
work
of
unloading,
the
tri-level
railroad
car
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
within
the
tariff
for
the
railroad.
it
was
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes
--
no
but
no
yes.
in
this
case
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
what
i'm
saying
in
this
case
that
is
true,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
be
in
the
next
person
who
is
working
on
a
tri-level
railroad
car
and
falls
off.
in
that
instance,
the
railroad
may
not
have
within
its
tariff
the
unloading
of
the
automobiles,
that
would
be
a
significant
fact
that
would
be
different.
so
that
there
are
differences
in
fact
in
each
case
and
i
think
what
the
district
court
did
here
is
that
in
this
particular
case,
he
concluded
that
southern
pacific
company
in
this
particular
case
had
a
non-delegable
duty.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
sinkler
was
a
case
involving
determination
of
the
defendant
class
as
opposed
to
the
plaintiff
class.
i
think
it
has
application
in
that
both
in
sinkler
where
they
were
determining
the
defendant
class,
in
other
words,
who
are
the
employers
that
can
sued?
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
because
sinkler
dealt
with
in
determining
the
defendant.
in
other
words,
it
was
the
defendant
and
employer
who
could
be
sued.
in
our
instance,
we're
talking
about
is
the
injured
party
an
employee
that
can
sue
an
employer,
an
identified
employer,
but
they
are
very
similar
in
that
both
cases,
both
the
baker
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
that's
right.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
correct.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
we're
going
back
the
other
way.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
and
but
there
is
a
similarity
in
that
both
cases
turn
on.
what
was
the
nature
of
the
work
that
the
party
involved
was
doing
at
the
time?
that
determine
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
correct.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
let's
say
it
was
so
found.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
that's
correct.
and
there
was
some
dispute
to
that
the
time
of
trial
and
in
the
briefs
as
to
whether
or
not
that
tariff
was
actually
covered
the
unloading
operation
and
your
honors,
will
note
that
we
have
attached
a
copy
to
our
brief
of
the
interrogatory
where
we
had
taken
the
deposition
of
one
of
the
s.p.
superiors
who
said
that
he
thought
it
was
an
alternative
tariff
situation
that
some
shippers
could
and
some
shippers
would
not
be
charged
that
tariff.
but
in
fact,
when
an
interrogatory
was
submitted
to
southern
pacific
company,
they
specified
that
employee
was
inaccurate
and
that
all
railroad
tri-level
automobile
carriers
at
that
time,
the
tariff
included
the
unloading
operation.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
the
appendix,
yes
your
honor.
that's
pages
roman
numeral
xii
through
xv.
the
question
is
--
begins
at
xii
and
the
answer
is
on
xv,
roman
numeral
xv
at
the
end.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i'm
speaking
the
petitioner.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
i
do
believe
it's
attached
to
the
brief
your
honor.
i
do
have
an
attached
to
the
petition
there.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
in
the
absence
of
any
further
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
i
don't'
that
would
make
difference.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
this
particular
individual.
in
other
words,
rather
than
the
employer,
in
other
words,
just
because
pacific
motor
trucking
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
right.
he
was
doing
a
particular
act
and
that
particular
act
because
of
the
nature
of
that
act
was
with
--
was
actually
performing
the
services
of
southern
pacific
company
and
consequently,
he
is
entitled
to
fela
coverage.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
i
would
say
he
could,
but
not
necessarily.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
any
of
these
cases
turn
in
one
particular
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
and
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
correct.
but
the
respondents
here
want
to
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
there's
one
that's
very
similar
to
that,
where
westinghouse
sold
an
engine
to
a
railroad
and
the
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
the
ninth
circuit
did.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
i
recognize
that,
your
honor.
i
disagree
profusely
with
the
ninth
circuit's
conclusion.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
and
the
ninth
circuit
is
saying
that
fourth
circuit
created
a
new
theory
and
we're
saying
that
that's
not
accurate,
and
the
evidence
of
that
is
the
tenth
circuit
harmonized
both
districts
didn't
have
any
problems.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
correct.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
he
was
also
injured
while
he
was
just
getting
the
automobile's
prepared
to
load.
he
wasn't
--
they
didn't
even
started
actually
driving
the
automobiles
off
the
railroad
car.
the
process,
where
he
has
injured
was
going
along
and
unhooking
the
chains
underneath
so
that
and
each
of
these
facts
can
be
important,
and
i
think
it
would
under
the
baker
decision,
the
test
is
that
district
court
at
that
particular
time
weighing
all
of
these
facts
what
conclusion
they
come
up
with.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
your
honor,
the
citation
that
i
referred
to
is
bryne
versus
pennsylvania
railroad
company.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes,
it's
262
f.
2d
906.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no.
it
was
--
certiorari
was
denied
here
but
it's
a
circuit
opinion.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
and
i've
asked
that
few
minutes
could
be
saved
to
i
think
for
rebuttal.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
briefly,
your
honors.
the
conclusion
of
law
that
i
proposed
to
the
trial
court
was
a
conclusion
of
law
which
the
court
can
find
at
page
163
of
the
index
where
i
stated
that
mr.
kelley
was
a
quote
“employee”
of
the
defendant
southern
pacific.
the
trial
court
did
not
reject
a
fact
finding
of
employment
and
what
the
trial
court
did
is
a
rejected
by
use
of
term
“employee.”
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
there
were
some
that
he
did
reject
your
honor.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
i
think
he
did
encompass
my
fact
finding
to
in
his
fact
finding
aid.
there
were
several
of
them
that
were
combined
up
by,
and
one
of
them
in
his
--
specifically
says,
they
had
the
responsibility
and
control.
i
think
it's
rather
clear
that
he
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
they
had
the
control.
and
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well
your
honor,
he
rejected
my
use
of
putting
“employee”
in
quotes
as
a
conclusion
of
law.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
and
what
he
did
though
your
honor
is
that
change
the
language
of
my
conclusion
of
law
and
added
a
fact
that
i
or
fact
--
a
conclusion
of
fact
that
i
had
not
proposed,
and
that
was
his
proposed
or
his
finding
number
9,
which
specific
and
i
had
not
offered
that.
it
says
the
work
being
performed
by
the
plaintiff
and
this
is
the
finding
that
brings
the
plaintiff
within
the
relationship
to
southern
pacific
company
because
of
the
nature
of
work
he
was
doing.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
no,
your
honor
and
because
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
he
rejected
my
conclusion
of
law
where
the
term
employee
was
used,
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
but
in
--
but
in
baker
versus
texas
which
is
a
test,
and
this
--
what
is
being
argued
here
is
that
southern
pacific
company
wants
this
court
now
to
go
back
and
rephrase
or
reword
or
change
baker
versus
texas
wherein
this
court
at
that
time
and
what
is
been
the
rule
for
about
many
years
now
that
you
make
a
factual
determination
as
to
whether
the
person
is
an
employee
as
that
term
is
used
within
the
fela.
it
is
not
that
you
make
a
factual
determination
that
the
person
in
fact
is
an
employee;
it's
a
matter
of
creating
a
class
of
individuals
on
an
individual
case
basis
as
to
whether
an
individual
fits
within
the
coverage
of
the
fela.
and
what
we
are
doing
here
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
do
and
that
was
to
recognize
that
it's
a
factual
conclusion
and
a
factual
determination
for
the
district
court
to
make,
and
what
is
happening
is
what
is
happening
here.
each
case
now
will
be
re-argued
in
re-argued
because
there
is
no
rule
coming
from
this
court
as
to
a
guideline
whereby
the
district
court's
can
use.
this
court
has
set
down
that
guideline
in
baker
and
it
says
it's
a
factual
determination
of
each
judge
to
do
in
each
individual
case.
and
that's
the
rule
that
they're
challenging.
they
want
this
to
have
to
be
a
matter
of
the
law
to
take
away
from
the
district
courts
the
ability
to
make
a
factual
determination.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
in
quotes,
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
because
baker
versus
texas,
it
said
it's
a
factual
determination
depending
on
what
the
work
that
was
being
performed
at
the
time
of
a
given
injury.
and
what
the
court
has
done
in
its
factual
conclusion
here
is
characterized
the
kind
of
work
that
was
being
done
that
supported
the
court's
conclusion
that
he
was
entitled
to
recovery.
rather
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
that's
correct.
he
chose
to
characterize
it
by
the
nature
of
the
work
as
suppose
do
a
label
is
to
whether
he
is
employee
or
agent
or
borrowed
servant
or
whatever,
he
characterized
by
the
nature
of
work
that
mr.
kelley
was
doing.
and
because
of
the
nature
of
work
that
he
was
doing,
he
was
entitled
to
fela
coverage,
and
that
has
been
the
standard
test
this
court
has
promulgated
since
baker
and
long
before
back
in
1927
with
regard
to
the
doctrine
of
borrowed
servant.
it
was
the
nature
of
work
the
individual
is
doing.
what
southern
pacific
wants
to
do
is
to
eliminate
the
whole
concept
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
why
he
chose
to
characterize
it
by
the
nature
of
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
all
i
know
is
that
he
chose
to
characterize
it
by
the
nature
of
work.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well
he
is
certainly,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
judge
is
cognizant
of
what
the
statute
reads
and
he
has
cited
the
statute
in
his
conclusions
of
law.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
that's
how
southern
pacific
characterizes
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
what
i'm
saying
is
that
what
smith
said
and
what
the
district
court
here
said
is
that
depending
on
the
type
of
work
that
the
person
was
doing
as
in
smith
that
he
does
fall
within
the
fela
and
smith
recognized
that
--
mr.
r.
jay
engel
yes.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
and
there
is
no
--the
history
of
having
employees
of
independent
contractors
covered
by
the
fela
is
not
a
new
concept
and
that's
what
they
wish
to
abolish.
mr.
r.
jay
engel
well,
the
restatement
sets
down
some
13
factors
anyone
of
which
can
be
controlling
and
no
one
of
which
is
controlling
and
one
them
is
that
what
the
parties
understand
the
relationship
whether
he
thinks
regarding
who
he
thinks
is
employed
by
or
who
they
think
is
their
employee.
but
that
is
only
one
factor
that
this
court
is
previously
said
should
be
used
by
the
court
as
a
guideline
and
i
think
of
particular
interest
if
you
will,
in
my
brief,
i
show
how
the
district
court
went
down
and
made
its
findings
to
almost
correlate
precisely
with
the
restatement
test
which
is
the
test
that
they
wish
to
abolish.
