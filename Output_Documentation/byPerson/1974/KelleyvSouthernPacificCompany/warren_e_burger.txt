chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
here
arguments
next
in
kelley
against
the
southern
pacific
railroad,
number
1270.
mr.
engel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
no
right
of
subrogation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
agree
that
the
district
court
was
in
its
mixed
finding
about
the
non-delegable
duty
holding
that
a
railroad
cannot
under
any
circumstances
engage
an
independent
contractor,
totally
unrelated
to
it.
unlike
pacific,
totally
unrelated
and
thereby
avoid
fela
responsibility?
is
that
the
impact
to
his
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
said
every
person,
i'll
limit
that
to
a
person
who
is
unloading
the
car?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hasn't
the
district
judge
said
that,
unloading
is
a
function
of
the
common
carrier
of
the
railroad
and
can't
be
passed
on
anybody
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words,
having
been
paid
for
it
for
the
unloading
operation
southern
pacific
would
not
be
heard
by
the
district
judge
to
say
that
wasn't
part
of
their
employment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
is
that
on
in
your
--
i
take
it,
it's
in
the
appendix.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
now,
unless
i
don't
read
my
roman
numerals
correct,
i
haven't
got
that
many
pages
in
your
appendix
at
least
to
your
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
got
the
cite
of
that
right
in
front
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
corrigan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
to
take
you
hypothetical,
i
suppose
it's
possible
that
judge
zirpoli
would
have
found
that
those
--
would
not
found
it
those
were
non-delegable
duties.
and
he
would
not
have
found
as
he
did
here
on
page
29
that
the
responsibility
or
immediate
supervision
and
control
of
the
maintenance
of
the
electronic
computer
system
was
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
friend
said
he
hope
so
and
he
was
then
tried
the
thing
how
it
evolved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
need
some
contravention
of
section
5?
what
you're
talking
about
when
you
say
evil?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
the
act
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
some
part
of
the
act
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
don't
know
of
mr.
engel
are
there
any
--
mr.
corrigan,
whether
there
are
any
pullman
cars
left
anymore,
but
a
pullman
car
is
typically
a
railroad
function,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
they
didn't
say
it
wasn't
the
railroad
function.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let
me
change
my
question.
it's
a
typical
common
carrier
function,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
the
car
looks
from
the
outside
much
like
all
the
cars?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
court
held,
the
pullman
car
employees
were
not
if
i
recall
it
correctly,
where
not
employees
of
the
railroad.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
more
important
did
not
come
under
the
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
would
have
been
entirely
appropriate
would
it
not
for
congress
to
have
put
pullman
car
employees
under
the
act
since
they
are
pulled
by
the
same
engine?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
anything
in
the
edwards
case
which
i
see
you
how
reason
to
be
familiar
with
that
indicated
that
the
pacific
fruit
express
was
owned
by
one
or
a
combination
of
railroads?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
apparently
lost
the
dissenting
opinions
in
that
case.
i
don't
find
it
with
me.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
corrigan.
mr.
engel,
you
have
2
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
--
that
didn't
quite
a
strong
argument
as
it
would
be
if
he
had
not
been
presented
with
a
--
an
explicit
finding
about
employment
and
rejected
it
or
at
least
failed
to
adopt
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
could
have
just
taken
the
quotation
marks
out
if
you
wanted
to
find
that
you
--
your
man
was
an
employee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
suppose
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
of
any
significance
at
all
or
relevance
that
kelley
has
never
recognized
himself
has
an
employee
of
the
railroad?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
