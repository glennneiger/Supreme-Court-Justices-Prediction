by
this
sentence
at

of
your
petition

justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
state
that
the
court
of
appeals
by
ruling
directed
to
the
contrary
without
supporting
authority
intentionally
created
a
conflict
in
court
of
appeals'
decisions.
are
you
suggesting
that
ca9
did
not
decide
this
case
in
good
faith
and
exercise
of
it
judicial
digression,
merely
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
conflict?

i
have
not
checked
these
other
cases
you
mentioned.
do
you
happen
to
recall
how
many
of
them
involved
jury
verdicts
with
respect
to
the
status
of
employee?
here,
you
had
no
jury.
you
had
a
district
judge
who
made
certain
findings,
some
of
which
perhaps
arguably,
at
least
mixed
findings
of
law
and
fact.
but
my
question
is,
in
the
cases
on
which
you
rely
were
the
jury
verdict
or
decisions
by
district
judges?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
while
i
interrupted
you,
whether
it
is
permissible
under
california
law
or
under
the
federal
act
for
an
injured
employee
to
receive
both
workman's
compensation
benefits
or
and
fela
benefits?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
he
be
entitled
to
retain
both
benefits?
justice

mr.
corrigan,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
was
a
member

wasn't
he?

teamsters,
right.
and
was
pacific

regulated
as
a

by
