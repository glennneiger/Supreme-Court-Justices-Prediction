mr.
engel,
i
take
that
you
are
supporting
then
the
findings
and
conclusions
that
judge
zirpoli
made?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
what
about
this
language
in
his
conclusion
that
this
--
the
work
being
performed
by
mr.
kelley
involved
a
non-delegable
duty
of
the
southern
pacific?
are
you
supporting
that
also?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
think
that
that
is
the
--
the
pivot
the
ninth
circuit's
disagreement
and
disaffection
with
district
courts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
perhaps
you
drew
this,
did
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
ninth
circuit
certainly
referred
to
that
non-delegable
language?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
thought
the
workman's
compensation
came
from
pacific?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
granted
it's
wholly
on
so,
but
it's
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
you
certainly
are
relying
on
more
than
one
factor
as
i
think
you
just
suggested
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
including
among
other
things,
the
longevity
on
the
job
of
mr.
kelley
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
for
doing
this
kind
of
thing
over
a
long
period?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
take
it
you
are
relying
specifically
on
baker,
are
you
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
corrigan,
excuse
me,
are
you
saying
that
there
are
no
elements
of
control
in
here
as
to
mr.
kelley's
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
thought
there
where
some
aspects
of
evidence
that
he
was
subject
to
direction
of
s.p.
employees.
is
my
impression
incorrect?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
corrigan,
if
you
prevail
here,
i
suppose
you
think
it
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
does
not
open
the
way
to
railroads
avoiding
fela
liability
by
contracting
out
various
things
such
as
maintenance
and
the
like?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun

is
that
it
so?
