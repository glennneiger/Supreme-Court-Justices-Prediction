justice

but
would
there
be
a
right
of
what,
a
credit
to
any
against
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
mere;y
asking
whether
there
be
a
double
recovery
here
and
i
take
that
this
is
what
justice
powell
is
concerned
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fact
finding
what
happen?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
finding
for
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
notice
that
court
of
appeals
did
cite
sinkler.
is
there
any
relevance
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
had
an
independent
employer
there
as
you
do
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
it
was
belt
railroad
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
was
performing
what
we
characterized
as
an
operational
activity
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
respondent
railroad
which
was
sued.
well,
in
light
of
finding
[inaudible]
this
situation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
we
held
--
that's
right.
there,
the
award
was
to
an
employee
of
this
plaintiff
--
of
this
defendant
railroad
by
reason
of
the
negligence
of
belt
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see
and
in
this
instance,
what
we
have
is
a
negligence
of
his
employer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
it
was
part
of
the
operational
activities
of
the
respondent
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
would
suppose
that
for
finding
for
here,
it
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
challenged
in
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that,
what
was
done
here
was
in
the
regular
course
of
its
business,
that
is
of
a
southern
pacific,
pursuant
to
its
contractual
responsibilities
to
the
shipper
and
its
tariff
response.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
in
any
event,
the
operation
was
within
the
operational
activities
of
southern
pacific?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
we
[inaudible]
with
that
finding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
to
ask
you
mr.
engel,
suppose
this
employer
had
not
been
wholly
owned
by
southern
pacific?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
make
any
difference.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
it
all
has
to
turn
on
the
fact
that
the
--
that
this
employer,
he
was
performing
in
the
central
operational
activity
of
the
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
he
is
doing
the
unloading?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
i
take
it
if
you
were
right,
an
engine
that
broke
down
and
instead
of
one
of
the
southern
pacific's
mechanics
repairing
it,
southern
pacific
had
hired
a
plumbing
company
and
a
plumber
employed
by
that
company
came
and
repaired
the
boiler
or
the
locomotive
and
was
injured
in
the
process.
he
would
say,
he
could
recover
against
southern
pacific?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
a
fact
finding
could
have
been
made.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
it
was
for
that
purposes
and
an
employee
of
the
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
cases
that
we
had
that
approach
that
in
this
court,
any?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
one
is
that?
i
thought
i
knew
these
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
in
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
third
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
under
the
control
in
the
sense
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
everything
he
did
was
directed
and
supervised
under
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
planned
out
and
laid
out
for
him
by
the
railroad?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
findings
this
--
finding
8
mr.
corrigan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

the
responsibility
for
immediate
supervision
and
so
forth
was
that
of
southern
pacific,
even
though
they
exercise
or
almost
executed
by
employers
of
pacific.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
as
i
read
it,
he
says
the
responsibility
for
immediate
supervision
and
the
control
of
the
unloading
operations
for
southern
pacific,
even
though
they
exercise
thereof,
meaning,
of
the
supervision
and
control
was
executed
by
employees
of
pacific.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
misspoke
yourself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
destroyed
it
[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
suggest.
i
think
we
went
also
in
sinkler,
didn't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
set
up
the
operational
activities
concept
as
something
peculiar
to
the
fela,
didn't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
a
delegable
and
non-delegable
are
really
appropriate
in
that
context?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
it
requires
that
the
railroad
itself
direct
and
supervise
and
detail
and
plan
and
everything
else
the
activities
of
the
employee
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
unless
fact
finding
aid
is
to
the
contrary?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
notice
two
and
that
is,
defendant
southern
pacific
binds
through
agreement
with
pacific
had
the
right
to
exercise
control
over
the
details
of
the
work
being
performed
by
the
plaintiff
at
the
time
the
accident
occurred?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah,
that's
what
i
say
that's
one
that
was
rejected,
unless
somebody
didn't
--
fact
finding
aid
which
was
signed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
that
was
an
interpretation
of
the
word
agent.
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
who's
paying
the
compensation?
the
pacific
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
prospect
of
the
double
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there
were
a
reversal
here,
would
there
be
a
prospect
of
the
double
recovery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
argued
it,
didn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
i
like
this
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
he
did
reject
your
fact
finding
too,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
i
mean,
that's
the
one
would
seems
to
me
have
some
relevance
here.
that's
the
one
that
seems
--
if
it's
covered
at
all
to
be
covered
in
fact
finding
aid
and
he
did
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
that's
--
you
have
it
an
award
in
favor
of
your
man
that
some
place
in
it
if
finding
that
he
was
before
the
trial.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

he
did
make
an
award,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.

was
it
