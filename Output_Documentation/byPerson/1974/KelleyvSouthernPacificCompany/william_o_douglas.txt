these
cases
are
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
arkansas.
they
involve
applications
and
motor
carriers
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
transport
commodities
in
the
southeast
and
southwestern
parts
of
this
country.
the
three-judge
court
refused
to
enforce
the
order
of
the
commission.
no
question
is
raised
here
by
the
parties
concerning
the
substantial
evidence
test.
there
is
a
question
raised
as
--
with
respect
to
the,
whether
the
district
court
was
correct
in
refusing
to
enforce
the
icc
order
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
within
the
meaning
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
this
is
a
rather
lengthy
opinion.
we
review
the
points
passed
on
by
the
district
court
and
argues
with
the
parties
and
we
conclude
that
the
district
court
erred
and
accordingly
we
reverse
and
remand
the
cases
to
wit.
