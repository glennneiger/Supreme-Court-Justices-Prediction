mr.
kendall
l.
vick
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court?
in
june
of
this
year,
this
court
speaking
through
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
michigan
versus
tucker
said
the
law
does
not
require
that
a
defendant
receive
a
perfect
trial,
only
a
fair
one.
it
has
been
said
at
least
three
times
this
morning
and
undoubtedly
hundreds
of
times
in
this
chamber,
is
it
fair?
i
would
also
beg
the
court
to
ask
in
this
case,
was
it
unfair,
was
taylor's
trial
unfair
and
if
so,
how?
counsel
for
the
appellant
taylor
has
not
given
the
court
any
help
in
answering
this
question
except
that
the
absence
of
women
in
this
case
is
a
per
se
grounds
for
reversal.
a
case
involving
aggravated
kidnap,
aggravated
rape
and
arm
robbery
of
a
woman
in
the
presence
of
her
daughter
and
small
child.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said
in
hoyt
that
it
is
really
within
the
realm
of
conjecture
whether
one
gets
a
jury
to
his
liking
or
not
depending
of
course
on
the
venire
and
i
can
see
that
the
percentage
of
women
is
very
small,
but
counsel
for
the
appellant
in
his
brief
and
in
oral
argument
a
side
step
at
every
foot
of
the
way
the
guidance
of
hoyt.
we
have
followed
hoyt,
we
have
done
what
we
thought
was
proper
in
following
the
guidelines
set
down
in
hoyt.
the
only
case
that
gives
us
any
problem
whatsoever
in
the
cases
cited
by
appellant
is
kiff,
but
i
would
like
to
just
quickly
skip
over
the
ones
he
has
cited.
alexander
race,
except
for
ballard
federal
question
women
on
jury
no
doubt
about
it,
but
not
applicable
to
the
states.
carter
race,
duncan
race,
fontanero
administrative
convenience,
no
race
but
sex,
hoyt,
kiff,
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment,
reed
administrative
convenience
and
sex.
san
antonio
independence
school
district
race,
smith
versus
texas
race,
thiel
as
we
discussed
this
morning
no
applicability
here
and
williams,
race.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
thiel
versus
southern
pacific.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
that
was
the
daily
wage
earners
being
excluded
from
--
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
now,
i
have
searched
peters
versus
kiff,
i
have
not
found
one
mention
of
hoyt.
justice
marshall
alludes
to
only
ballard
in
footnote
12.
he
could
have
bruised
hoyt
perhaps,
he
could
have
given
some
indication
in
the
states
that
he
was
unhappy
with
hoyt,
perhaps
we
could
have
had
some
other
admonition
but
nothing,
silence
in
footnote
12,
only
reference
is
to
ballard.
now,
the
problem
with
this
case
as
the
state
of
louisiana
sees
it
is
that
there
was
no
lawless
law
enforcement
here.
there
is
no
mapp
question
here,
no
miranda
question
here
as
the
wallace
tucker
versus
michigan
or
the
applicability
of
miranda.
there
was
no
lawless
law
enforcement
for
which
law
enforcement
should
be
penalized.
the
state
of
louisiana
went
by
the
rules
set
down
in
hoyt.
now,
if
the
court
in
its
wisdom
remands
this
case
i
just
wonder
if
it
against
in
the
realm
of
conjecture
but
i
wonder
if
there
are
women
on
the
jury,
if
in
a
case
involving
women
in
a
--
the
victim
of
a
heinous
crime
whether
the
other
side
of
the
coin
might
not
come
into
play,
that
that's
prejudice
that
there
are
women
on
the
jury
and
more
than
one,
five
or
six
of
them
and
that's
a
hanging
jury
so
i
don't
know
how
the
state
of
the
louisiana
can
win
in
this
sort
of
--
in
this
sort
of
context.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
the
case
is
cited
in
both
briefs.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
well,
i
would
think
that
ballard
held
that.
however,
if
the
court
please,
i'd
have
to
retract
that.
ballard
i
think
was
exercising
supervision,
this
court
exercising
supervision
over
the
--
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
not
that
i
know
of.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
not
that
i
know
of
but
it's
alluded
too
because
of
the
applicability
of
the
sixth
amendment
through
the
fourteen
amendment.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
was
not.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
not
directly
on
point.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
yes
it
does
give
me
some
trouble
especially
the
--
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
yes.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
none
mr.
chief
justice
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
that
the
counsel
for
the
opponents
conceded
that.
the
only
issue
here
is
women
being
systematically
excluded
as
it
were
from
this
jury.
that
concludes
to
my
remarks
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
