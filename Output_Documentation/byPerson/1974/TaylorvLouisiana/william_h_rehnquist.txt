justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
a
jury
composed
of
12
men
be
expected
to
hurt
your
client's
chances
since
your
client
is
a
man?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what
authority
do
you
have
for
saying
that
in
the
absence
of
such
and
what
decision
this
court
do
you
rely
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
that
wasn't
--
that
was
a
federal
court
decision
reviewing
the
jury
system
in
federal
court,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
--
that
was
a
seventh
amendment
case
involving
a
civil
jury
trial.
now,
the
seventh
amendment
has
no
application
to
the
states
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
your
principal
authority
then
as
the
thiel
case
for
saying
that
your
client
has
standing
to
raise
this
issue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
a
court
opinion
in
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
an
opinion
for
the
court
in
that
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
opinion
are
you
going
to
rely
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
the
chief
justice's
opinion
relied
on
the
notion
of
prejudice
and
that
there
ought
to
be
some
showing
of
prejudice,
it
was
a
dissenting
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
king,
when
we
use
to
try
jury
cases
where
i
practiced,
we
use
to
follow
a
maxim
which
was
perhaps
an
old
wise
tale
that
woman
is
man's
best
friend
but
her
own
worst
enemy
and
the
idea
was
if
you
had
a
male
client
you
wanted
a
bunch
of
woman
on
the
jury
and
if
you
had
a
woman
client
you
wanted
a
bunch
of
men
on
the
jury.
i
take
it
in
your
area
they
don't
follow
any
such
handy
maxims?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
can't
--
you
can't
in
louisiana,
can
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
--
if
you
have
5%
women
jurors,
you
at
least
have
some
access
to
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
a
jury
composed
of
12
