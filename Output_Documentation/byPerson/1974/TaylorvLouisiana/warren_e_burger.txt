chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
73-5744,
taylor
against
louisiana.
mr.
king
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
position
be
the
same
mr.
king
if
in
fact
there
had
been
five
women
on
this
jury
who
had
got
there
by
the
existing
processes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
would
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
argument
would
apply
equally
to
a
jury
from
which
the
five
--
the
only
five
women
were
stricken
by
peremptory
challenges
but
you
have
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
the
choice
necessarily
of
the
defendant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
says
to
know
the
law
--
the
law
does
exclude
them
as
of
now
in
louisiana
in
the
sense
that
you’re
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
is
not
the
peremptory
challenge
in
operation
sometimes
a
mode
of
exclusion
by
operation
of
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
necessarily
all
alike,
sometimes
one
side
has
given
more
peremptory
challenges
than
the
other?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
you
standing
in
any
degree
on
the
proposition
that
women
as
a
category
might
be
more
compassionate
toward
a
defendant
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
have
a
different
attitude
toward
defendant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
that
you
should
think
that
one,
they
reduced
from
first
degree
murder
to
manslaughter.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
record
show
how
many
are
actively
used?
what's
the
ratio?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
just
want
the
chance
to
keep
them
or
strike
them
as
the
particular
case
fits
your
needs?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
its
a
necessary
corollary
that
the
court
would
have
to
approve
under
hoyt
voluntary
system
for
men
only?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
state
would
be
free
i
take
it
to
set
its
own
age
limits
for
men
and
women
as
long
as
they
treated
them
in
the
same
way,
would
they
not?
suppose
when
it's
something
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
suggest
a
hypothetical?
suppose
they
said
people
over
30
and
over
and
70
and
under
were
both
men
and
women,
would
that
give
you
any
problems?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
resume
after
lunch.
[luncheon
break]
you
are
saving
the
balance
of
your
time
for
rebuttal
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
mr.
vick.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
allegation
anywhere
in
this
case
that
the
jury
commissioners
or
other
state
officials
systematically
sought
to
discourage
or
exclude
the
presence
of
women
on
juries
anyway?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you
mr.
vick.
mr.
king,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
now
of
course
at
federal
policy,
is
it
not,
to
undertake
to
see
that
every
jury
represents
a
cross
section?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
[inaudible]
the
heart
of
your
cases
that
the
hoyt
case
is
wrong
and
it
should
be
overruled,
it
was
wrongly
decided,
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
just
another
way
for
saying
that
every
person
independent
of
sex
or
race
has
a
constitutional
right
to
what
you
call
a
cross
section
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
put
it
in
that
way,
arbitrary
exclusion,
you
must
of
necessity
carry
the
burden
or
you
must
of
necessity
be
saying
that
to
allow
a
women
a
preferential
exemption
is
an
arbitrary
exclusion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
care
to
enlarge
on
that
a
little
bit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
king,
thank
you
mr.
