mr.
william
mcm.
king
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
louisiana
constitutional
provisions
and
statutory
provisions
are
the
same
in
this
case
is
what
is
present
in
the
healy
case,
but
there
is
this
distinction.
the
appellant
here
was
charged
with
a
serious
criminal
offense,
a
capital
offense
in
the
louisiana,
found
guilty
by
a
jury,
an
all
male
jury,
chosen
from
an
all
male
jury
venire.
a
motion
to
quash
the
jury
venire
prior
to
trial
was
entered
and
denied.
the
motion
was
based
on
the
ground
that
his
rights
to
an
impartial
jury
under
the
guarantees
of
the
sixth
and
fourteen
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
were
denied
him.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
with
the
existing
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions,
the
position
that
we
take
would
still
be
the
same.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
on
its
face
we
say
the
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
which
not
only
exempt,
but
exclude
one
is
unconstitutional.
it
provides
for
jury
service
only
where
the
woman
volunteers
and
excludes
her
from
the
jury
unless
she
does
volunteer.
the
stipulation
of
fact
between
the
state
and
healy
are
equally
applicable
to
this
case
and
that
it
occurred
at
the
same
time
and
during
the
same
period
and
that
stipulation
show
the
complete
failure
of
the
volunteer
system
for
women
as
adopted
by
the
constitution
under
the
states
statute.
the
distinction
in
this,
in
the
healy
case
as
we
see
it
is
that
healy
have
a
sixth
amendment
question
which
arises
because
of
this
court's
opinion
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
which
opinion
was
rendered
in
1968,
this
trial
took
place
in
1972.
in
duncan
versus
louisiana,
the
court
will
remember
the
right
of
a
state
court
defendant
in
a
serious
criminal
trial
to
a
jury
was
granted
him
by
application
of
the
sixth
amendment
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
williams
versus
florida,
there
was
an
attempt
made
to
have
this
court
extend
the
application
of
duncan
versus
louisiana
to
a
12-man
jury
and
the
court
denied
that
extension
on
the
grounds
that
numbers
alone
did
not
constitute
the
essential
attribute
of
a
jury.
that
same
position
was
taken
i
believe
by
the
court
in
apodaca
where
the
number
necessary
to
convict
was
at
issue,
but
here
the
quality
of
the
jury
is
at
issue
and
an
essential
attribute
of
the
jury
trial
is
at
issue
for
criminal
defendants.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
pardon
me?
mr.
william
mcm.
king
in
the
very
case
which
denied
the
extension
to
the
12-man
jury,
this
court
declared
what
the
essential
attribute
was.
it
said
that
the
purpose
of
a
jury
was
to
prevent
oppression
by
government
and
that
the
manner
in
which
it
is
exercised
is
by
the
jury
being
a
barrier
between
the
government
or
the
accuser
and
the
accused,
and
that
in
order
to
form
an
effective
barrier,
the
court
stated
that
it
is
composed
of
representative
segments
of
the
community
and
that
in
denying
that
the
12-man
jury
applied
to
louisiana,
the
court
looked
to
whether
the
number
on
the
jury
had
the
effect
of
denying
that
representative
cross
section
of
the
community.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
if
your
honor
is
asking
me
whether
i
can
feel,
touch,
smell
or
taste
that
home
or
whether
there
is
a
home
that
is
tangible
in
character,
i
cannot
do
so.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
well,
i
rely
primarily
in
the
federal
context
in
the
federal
courts
on
thiel
--
on
the
thiel
case.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
but
the
court
found
there
that
the
exemption
by
the
federal
judge
of
daily
wage
earners
violated
the
system
of
jury
to
such
an
extent
that
it
would
not
even
look
into
whether
the
party
--
the
appellant
in
that
case
was
a
member
of
that
class.
they
--
this
court
would
not
even
go
behind
of
that,
once
it's
found
that
the
jury
system
–-
mr.
william
mcm.
king
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
if
the
--
if
that
application
was
made
in
a
civil
jury
trial
much
more
so
shall
apply
to
a
criminal
jury
trial
and
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
only
by
application
and
by
a
mode
of
reasoning.
i
believe
the
duncan
case
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
believe
duncan.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
absolutely,
i
believer
that
duncan
case
is
the
principle
case.
in
peters
versus
kiff
which
was
a
standing
case
between
a
white
who
was
a
complainant
of
the
lack
of
blacks.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
--
on
a
grand
jury.
i
believe
it
also
may
have
been
applicable
to
that
petit
jury
in
that
case.
it
is
not
that
case
that
i'm
relying
upon
but
the
court
stated
in
that
case
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
pardon?
mr.
william
mcm.
king
there
was
a
--
you
know
--
divide
a
court
3,
3,
3.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
[attempt
to
laughter]
the
language
in
the
--
in
justice
marshall's
opinion
and
the
language
in
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
that
there’s
any
of
them,
express
the
thought
of
the
court
i
believe
that
if
that
had
been
a
post
duncan
case
there
would
have
been
little
question
of
the
standing
to
complain.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
believe
that
in
essence
is
that
so
but
the
language
in
the
court's
dissenting
opinion
stated
that
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
the
essential
attributes
of
trial
by
a
jury,
but
here
you
are
concerned
with
the
essential
attributes
of
trial
by
a
jury.
if
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
you
applied
the
jury
to
the
states
in
criminal
proceedings,
serious
criminal
proceedings,
then
to
deny
the
essence
of
the
jury
trial
is
to
an
effect
deny
the
jury
trial,
because
if
you
don't
have
a
jury
composed
in
as
larger
a
measure
as
possible
of
representative
cross
segment
of
--
you
have
no
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
oh
no
sir,
the
jury
venire.
the
venire
who
can
say
whether
the
selection
from
the
venire
will
bring
about
a
proportion
that
is
–-
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes
sir.
the
possibility
of
bias
in
situations
where
state
juries
do
not
have
to
be
selected
as
far
as
possible
from
a
cross
section
of
the
community
is
so
present
that
without
a
restriction
on
the
state
jury's
selective
system,
it
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
you
have
no
jury
at
all.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
when
53%
of
a
community
are
excluded
from
the
jury,
i
would
say
that
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
of
course
that's
a
problem.
i
really
don't
feel
that
i
can
answer.
i'm
arguing
a
the
case
for
a
particular
individual
who
has
raised
his
--
this
issue
prior
to
trial.
what
maybe
the
fate
of
those
who
have
been
convicted
under
this
exclusionary
device,
i
really
would
rather
not
say.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it
doesn't
equate
with
what
the
court
had
said
was
a
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
well,
it
does
no
good
your
honor.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it
was
not
made
that's
right,
in
duncan,
but
it
does
no
good
to
say
that
juries
are
meant
to
protect
people’s
liberty
and
yet
deprive
the
jury
of
an
essential
attribute
because
the
same
jury
that
was
present
in
the
thiel
case
may
well
have
been
the
same
jury
to
protect
the
liberty
that
we
speak
of.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
but
there
your
honor
that's
a
matter
of
choice,
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
but
were
the
law,
the
law
excludes,
i
believe
that's
another
matter.
what
happens
in
practice
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
that's
what
say
as
so
vicious.
the
exclusionary
device
by
law.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
correct
your
honor
but
that's
a
right
that's
granted
to
all
alike,
the
peremptory
challenge.
there
is
no
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
but
only
--
but
only
in
a
numerical
fashion,
it's
not
meant
to
be
a
device
that
can
be
used
to
exclude
segments
from
the
community.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
probably
best
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
can't
say
that,
i
know
there
have
been
studies
made
of
that.
in
1948,
i
represented
a
defendant
who
was
accused
of
murder
in
new
orleans
on
which
jury
served
the
first
woman
juror
in
the
history
of
the
state
on
a
capital
case
and
i
would
say
that
she
was
sympathetic
by
my
own
personal
experience,
but
that's
a
matter
of
conjecture
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
pardon?
mr.
william
mcm.
king
he
was
found
guilty
of
the
lesser
charge
of
manslaughter
and
after
the
case,
the
jurors
were
questioned,
she
happened
to
be
the
president
of
the
league
of
women
voters
and
volunteered
for
the
jury
service
but
i
didn't
know
that
at
the
time,
she
was
the
first
woman
in
the
state
of
louisiana
in
1948.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
pardon?
mr.
william
mcm.
king
in
a
capital
case
and
in
answer
to
question
after
the
case,
it
appeared
that
she
had
a
greater
sense
of
justice,
fair
play
and
compassion
than
the
men
sitting
on
the
bench.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
oh
your
honor
asked
and
that's
the
only
way
i
can
answer
the
question
is
by
my
own
personal
experience.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
victim
was
a
woman.
the
victim
was
woman,
her
daughter
and
the
woman's
son,
small
son.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
three
victims
but
within
the
charge
and
part
of
the
evidence
introduced
was
that
of
aggravated
rape
of
the
mother
at
knife
point.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
with
a
baseball
bat.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no
sir,
i
couldn't
honestly
and
intellectually
i
couldn't
make
that
statement,
but
i
believe
in
the
hoyt
case
it
was
based
an
equal
protection
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
correct.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
you
know
honestly
i
couldn't
say
that,
i
couldn't
say
it.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no
sir,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
know
there
have
been
studies
made
that
have
reached
that
conclusion
by
certain
educators.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
that
women
are
more
sympathetic
to
than
man.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
in
kidnapping
types
of
case.
there
have
been
studies
by
scholars
to
that
effect
but
i
have
to
say
its
conjecture
and
i
really
don't
have
any
tangible
evidence
of
that,
there
is
that
the
school
of
thought.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
only
insofar
as
the
court
can
recognize
it,
i
can't
give
any
more
to
it.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
if
your
court
asks
--
if
the
court
ask
me
that.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
can
only
make
the
argument
without
proof.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
make
that
argument.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
but
i
have
no
proof
to
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
have
no
tangible
evidence
of
that.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
if
it
is
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i'd
have
to
say
again,
i
have
no
proof
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
on
the
jury
venire
--
on
the
jury
venire.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
record
show
that
in
170
--
13
women
were
included
in
the
total
of
1815
names
drawn
for
the
petit
jury
system,
term.
now,
in
washington
parish
which
is
a
parish
above
saint
harmony
and
part
of
the
same
judicial
district,
only
one
woman
has
ever
been
known
to
volunteer
for
jury
service
and
there
have
never
been
anyone
appear
on
the
petit
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
they
should
be
available
for
jury
service
without
the
volunteer
system
and
that's
a
failure.
the
volunteer
system
is
a
complete
failure.
it
cannot
no
more
work
for
the
women
than
it
would
for
the
men
and
i
don't
believe
the
court
would
approve
a
volunteer
system
with
jury
service,
blanket
wall,
a
blanket
bar
than
wouldn't
work,
it
have
no
juries
whatsoever.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
believe
that
would
be
the
same
in
order
to
acknowledge
that
that's
a
proper
system
for
women,
the
court
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
that
would
also
be
a
proper
system
for
men
and
it
doesn't
work.
i've
never
ever
seen
a
man
volunteer
for
jury
service
who
would
enjoyed
an
exemption
under
our
law.
the
exemptions
in
louisiana,
the
particular
exemptions
in
louisiana
are
personal,
but
i've
never
seen
one
man
volunteer,
so
it
is
not
really
a
mock
against
women
that
only
10%
have
volunteered,
that's
incredible
really
under
the
circumstances
because
i've
never
seen
a
man
volunteer
who
enjoyed
an
exemption.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
exemptions
given
to
man
are
waivable,
yes.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes
your
honor
they
are.
now,
in
hoyt
i
believe
that
was
an
equal
protection
case
but
i
believe
the
contention
made
in
that
case
was
specifically
that
there
weren't
women
on
the
particular
jury
that
they
tried
to
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it
was
an
equal
–
excuse
me
i
understand
correctly
i
just
felt
in
my
memory
had
--
but
in
that
case
the
contention
was
made
that
that
woman
was
entitled
to
women
on
the
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
recall
language
of
that
stated
the
core
of
the
case,
i
maybe
mistaken.
the
core
of
the
hoyt
case
was
that
the
demand
that
there'd
be
woman
on
the
jury
that
that
type
of
crime
demanded
the
compassion
of
women
on
the
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
gives
a
fair
possibility.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes
sir.
now,
the
arguments
made
about
mrs.
ginsburg
relating
to
the
women
are
the
discernable
group
are
equally
applicable
here
and
i
won't
burden
the
court
the
time
it
takes
to
repeat
even
though
i
couldn't
repeat
them
--
that
argument
in
a
sounded
fashion
than
mrs.
ginsburg,
i
will
adopt
those
arguments.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
from
the
standpoint
of
equal
protection
that's
probably
correct.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes
sir.
i
believe
that
it
would
because
what
reason
would
there
be
for
the
people
30
to
20
not
being
able
to
serve
on
jury.
what
possible
rationality
would
there
be
behind
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
defendant
and
within
the
20
and
30
age
group
could
well
complain
of
that
i
would
think.
thank
you.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
mr.
william
mcm.
king
just
briefly
your
honor.
hoyt
was
a
pre
duncan
case
and
this
is
the
case
i
believe
your
honor
which
asks
the
question
whether
the
application
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
due
process
cause
require
that
juries
be
chosen
from
a
representative
cross
section
of
the
community.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
issue
was
whether
a
jury
trial
should
be
provided
and
is
required
of
a
right
in
state
criminal
cases.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no
sir,
this
is
the
case.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it
might
not
have
been,
this
is
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no
sir,
that
why
i
think
this
is
the
case
which
squarely
presents
the
issue
to
the
court.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
correct.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
statutory
for
federal
courts
and
the
court
has
held
in
due
process
cases,
not
held
but
there
has
been
much
language
in
the
due
process
cases
which
would
have
require
a
representative
cross
section
in
the
jury
even
without
the
application
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it's
part
of
it,
yes.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
second
phase
of
it
is
that
the
jury
even
though
the
complaining
parties
such
as
thiel
is
not
a
member
of
the
excluded
class
that
he
as
a
right
to
have
that
vindicated
that
there
is
no
representative
cross
section
of
the
community
from
which
the
jury
can
be
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
as
far
as
possible
without
any
arbitrary
exclusion
particularly
of
such
a
large
class
and
that
in
volunteer.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes
and
we
feel
though
that
the
burden
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
your
honor
mentioned
the
burden.
we
feel
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
appellant
in
this
case
has
the
constitutional
right
to
an
impartial
jury
under
the
sixth
amendment
or
application
through
the
fourteen
amendment.
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
was
a
compelling
state
interest
for
that
exclusion
falls
not
on
us
but
on
the
state
because
taylor
has
been
deprived
in
our
opinion
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
believe
it
be
difficult
to
reach
a
decision
without,
i
mean
favorable
to
theil
without
overruling
that
thought
of
hoyt
which
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
exclusion
statute
and
the
constitutional
provisions
of
the
state
of
the
louisiana,
to
that
extent,
yes.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no
sir,
i
was
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
sixth
amendment
due
process.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
correct.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
correct
but
hoyt
causes
interwoven,
i
mean
what
they
said
in
hoyt
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no,
this
is
a
jury,
was
purely
and
simply
the
quality
of
the
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it
could
be.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
louisiana
constitutional
provisions
and
statutory
provisions
are
the
same
in
this
case
is
what
is
present
in
the
healy
case,
but
there
is
this
distinction.
the
appellant
here
was
charged
with
a
serious
criminal
offense,
a
capital
offense
in
the
louisiana,
found
guilty
by
a
jury,
an
all
male
jury,
chosen
from
an
all
male
jury
venire.
a
motion
to
quash
the
jury
venire
prior
to
trial
was
entered
and
denied.
the
motion
was
based
on
the
ground
that
his
rights
to
an
impartial
jury
under
the
guarantees
of
the
sixth
and
fourteen
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
were
denied
him.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
with
the
existing
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions,
the
position
that
we
take
would
still
be
the
same.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
on
its
face
we
say
the
constitutional
and
statutory
provisions
which
not
only
exempt,
but
exclude
one
is
unconstitutional.
it
provides
for
jury
service
only
where
the
woman
volunteers
and
excludes
her
from
the
jury
unless
she
does
volunteer.
the
stipulation
of
fact
between
the
state
and
healy
are
equally
applicable
to
this
case
and
that
it
occurred
at
the
same
time
and
during
the
same
period
and
that
stipulation
show
the
complete
failure
of
the
volunteer
system
for
women
as
adopted
by
the
constitution
under
the
states
statute.
the
distinction
in
this,
in
the
healy
case
as
we
see
it
is
that
healy
have
a
sixth
amendment
question
which
arises
because
of
this
court's
opinion
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
which
opinion
was
rendered
in
1968,
this
trial
took
place
in
1972.
in
duncan
versus
louisiana,
the
court
will
remember
the
right
of
a
state
court
defendant
in
a
serious
criminal
trial
to
a
jury
was
granted
him
by
application
of
the
sixth
amendment
through
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
williams
versus
florida,
there
was
an
attempt
made
to
have
this
court
extend
the
application
of
duncan
versus
louisiana
to
a
12-man
jury
and
the
court
denied
that
extension
on
the
grounds
that
numbers
alone
did
not
constitute
the
essential
attribute
of
a
jury.
that
same
position
was
taken
i
believe
by
the
court
in
apodaca
where
the
number
necessary
to
convict
was
at
issue,
but
here
the
quality
of
the
jury
is
at
issue
and
an
essential
attribute
of
the
jury
trial
is
at
issue
for
criminal
defendants.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
pardon
me?
mr.
william
mcm.
king
in
the
very
case
which
denied
the
extension
to
the
12-man
jury,
this
court
declared
what
the
essential
attribute
was.
it
said
that
the
purpose
of
a
jury
was
to
prevent
oppression
by
government
and
that
the
manner
in
which
it
is
exercised
is
by
the
jury
being
a
barrier
between
the
government
or
the
accuser
and
the
accused,
and
that
in
order
to
form
an
effective
barrier,
the
court
stated
that
it
is
composed
of
representative
segments
of
the
community
and
that
in
denying
that
the
12-man
jury
applied
to
louisiana,
the
court
looked
to
whether
the
number
on
the
jury
had
the
effect
of
denying
that
representative
cross
section
of
the
community.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
if
your
honor
is
asking
me
whether
i
can
feel,
touch,
smell
or
taste
that
home
or
whether
there
is
a
home
that
is
tangible
in
character,
i
cannot
do
so.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
well,
i
rely
primarily
in
the
federal
context
in
the
federal
courts
on
thiel
--
on
the
thiel
case.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
but
the
court
found
there
that
the
exemption
by
the
federal
judge
of
daily
wage
earners
violated
the
system
of
jury
to
such
an
extent
that
it
would
not
even
look
into
whether
the
party
--
the
appellant
in
that
case
was
a
member
of
that
class.
they
--
this
court
would
not
even
go
behind
of
that,
once
it's
found
that
the
jury
system
–-
mr.
william
mcm.
king
that's
correct
your
honor,
but
if
the
--
if
that
application
was
made
in
a
civil
jury
trial
much
more
so
shall
apply
to
a
criminal
jury
trial
and
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
only
by
application
and
by
a
mode
of
reasoning.
i
believe
the
duncan
case
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
believe
duncan.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
absolutely,
i
believer
that
duncan
case
is
the
principle
case.
in
peters
versus
kiff
which
was
a
standing
case
between
a
white
who
was
a
complainant
of
the
lack
of
blacks.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
--
on
a
grand
jury.
i
believe
it
also
may
have
been
applicable
to
that
petit
jury
in
that
case.
it
is
not
that
case
that
i'm
relying
upon
but
the
court
stated
in
that
case
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
pardon?
mr.
william
mcm.
king
there
was
a
--
you
know
--
divide
a
court
3,
3,
3.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
[attempt
to
laughter]
the
language
in
the
--
in
justice
marshall's
opinion
and
the
language
in
chief
justice
burger's
opinion
that
there’s
any
of
them,
express
the
thought
of
the
court
i
believe
that
if
that
had
been
a
post
duncan
case
there
would
have
been
little
question
of
the
standing
to
complain.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
believe
that
in
essence
is
that
so
but
the
language
in
the
court's
dissenting
opinion
stated
that
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
the
essential
attributes
of
trial
by
a
jury,
but
here
you
are
concerned
with
the
essential
attributes
of
trial
by
a
jury.
if
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
you
applied
the
jury
to
the
states
in
criminal
proceedings,
serious
criminal
proceedings,
then
to
deny
the
essence
of
the
jury
trial
is
to
an
effect
deny
the
jury
trial,
because
if
you
don't
have
a
jury
composed
in
as
larger
a
measure
as
possible
of
representative
cross
segment
of
--
you
have
no
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
oh
no
sir,
the
jury
venire.
the
venire
who
can
say
whether
the
selection
from
the
venire
will
bring
about
a
proportion
that
is
–-
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes
sir.
the
possibility
of
bias
in
situations
where
state
juries
do
not
have
to
be
selected
as
far
as
possible
from
a
cross
section
of
the
community
is
so
present
that
without
a
restriction
on
the
state
jury's
selective
system,
it
is
tantamount
to
saying
that
you
have
no
jury
at
all.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
when
53%
of
a
community
are
excluded
from
the
jury,
i
would
say
that
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
of
course
that's
a
problem.
i
really
don't
feel
that
i
can
answer.
i'm
arguing
a
the
case
for
a
particular
individual
who
has
raised
his
--
this
issue
prior
to
trial.
what
maybe
the
fate
of
those
who
have
been
convicted
under
this
exclusionary
device,
i
really
would
rather
not
say.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it
doesn't
equate
with
what
the
court
had
said
was
a
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
well,
it
does
no
good
your
honor.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it
was
not
made
that's
right,
in
duncan,
but
it
does
no
good
to
say
that
juries
are
meant
to
protect
people’s
liberty
and
yet
deprive
the
jury
of
an
essential
attribute
because
the
same
jury
that
was
present
in
the
thiel
case
may
well
have
been
the
same
jury
to
protect
the
liberty
that
we
speak
of.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
but
there
your
honor
that's
a
matter
of
choice,
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
but
were
the
law,
the
law
excludes,
i
believe
that's
another
matter.
what
happens
in
practice
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
that's
what
say
as
so
vicious.
the
exclusionary
device
by
law.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
correct
your
honor
but
that's
a
right
that's
granted
to
all
alike,
the
peremptory
challenge.
there
is
no
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
but
only
--
but
only
in
a
numerical
fashion,
it's
not
meant
to
be
a
device
that
can
be
used
to
exclude
segments
from
the
community.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
probably
best
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
can't
say
that,
i
know
there
have
been
studies
made
of
that.
in
1948,
i
represented
a
defendant
who
was
accused
of
murder
in
new
orleans
on
which
jury
served
the
first
woman
juror
in
the
history
of
the
state
on
a
capital
case
and
i
would
say
that
she
was
sympathetic
by
my
own
personal
experience,
but
that's
a
matter
of
conjecture
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
pardon?
mr.
william
mcm.
king
he
was
found
guilty
of
the
lesser
charge
of
manslaughter
and
after
the
case,
the
jurors
were
questioned,
she
happened
to
be
the
president
of
the
league
of
women
voters
and
volunteered
for
the
jury
service
but
i
didn't
know
that
at
the
time,
she
was
the
first
woman
in
the
state
of
louisiana
in
1948.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
pardon?
mr.
william
mcm.
king
in
a
capital
case
and
in
answer
to
question
after
the
case,
it
appeared
that
she
had
a
greater
sense
of
justice,
fair
play
and
compassion
than
the
men
sitting
on
the
bench.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
oh
your
honor
asked
and
that's
the
only
way
i
can
answer
the
question
is
by
my
own
personal
experience.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
victim
was
a
woman.
the
victim
was
woman,
her
daughter
and
the
woman's
son,
small
son.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
three
victims
but
within
the
charge
and
part
of
the
evidence
introduced
was
that
of
aggravated
rape
of
the
mother
at
knife
point.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
with
a
baseball
bat.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no
sir,
i
couldn't
honestly
and
intellectually
i
couldn't
make
that
statement,
but
i
believe
in
the
hoyt
case
it
was
based
an
equal
protection
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
correct.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
you
know
honestly
i
couldn't
say
that,
i
couldn't
say
it.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no
sir,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
know
there
have
been
studies
made
that
have
reached
that
conclusion
by
certain
educators.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
that
women
are
more
sympathetic
to
than
man.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
in
kidnapping
types
of
case.
there
have
been
studies
by
scholars
to
that
effect
but
i
have
to
say
its
conjecture
and
i
really
don't
have
any
tangible
evidence
of
that,
there
is
that
the
school
of
thought.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
only
insofar
as
the
court
can
recognize
it,
i
can't
give
any
more
to
it.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
if
your
court
asks
--
if
the
court
ask
me
that.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
can
only
make
the
argument
without
proof.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
make
that
argument.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
but
i
have
no
proof
to
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
have
no
tangible
evidence
of
that.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
if
it
is
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i'd
have
to
say
again,
i
have
no
proof
of
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
on
the
jury
venire
--
on
the
jury
venire.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
record
show
that
in
170
--
13
women
were
included
in
the
total
of
1815
names
drawn
for
the
petit
jury
system,
term.
now,
in
washington
parish
which
is
a
parish
above
saint
harmony
and
part
of
the
same
judicial
district,
only
one
woman
has
ever
been
known
to
volunteer
for
jury
service
and
there
have
never
been
anyone
appear
on
the
petit
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
they
should
be
available
for
jury
service
without
the
volunteer
system
and
that's
a
failure.
the
volunteer
system
is
a
complete
failure.
it
cannot
no
more
work
for
the
women
than
it
would
for
the
men
and
i
don't
believe
the
court
would
approve
a
volunteer
system
with
jury
service,
blanket
wall,
a
blanket
bar
than
wouldn't
work,
it
have
no
juries
whatsoever.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
believe
that
would
be
the
same
in
order
to
acknowledge
that
that's
a
proper
system
for
women,
the
court
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
that
would
also
be
a
proper
system
for
men
and
it
doesn't
work.
i've
never
ever
seen
a
man
volunteer
for
jury
service
who
would
enjoyed
an
exemption
under
our
law.
the
exemptions
in
louisiana,
the
particular
exemptions
in
louisiana
are
personal,
but
i've
never
seen
one
man
volunteer,
so
it
is
not
really
a
mock
against
women
that
only
10%
have
volunteered,
that's
incredible
really
under
the
circumstances
because
i've
never
seen
a
man
volunteer
who
enjoyed
an
exemption.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
exemptions
given
to
man
are
waivable,
yes.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes
your
honor
they
are.
now,
in
hoyt
i
believe
that
was
an
equal
protection
case
but
i
believe
the
contention
made
in
that
case
was
specifically
that
there
weren't
women
on
the
particular
jury
that
they
tried
to
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it
was
an
equal
–
excuse
me
i
understand
correctly
i
just
felt
in
my
memory
had
--
but
in
that
case
the
contention
was
made
that
that
woman
was
entitled
to
women
on
the
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
recall
language
of
that
stated
the
core
of
the
case,
i
maybe
mistaken.
the
core
of
the
hoyt
case
was
that
the
demand
that
there'd
be
woman
on
the
jury
that
that
type
of
crime
demanded
the
compassion
of
women
on
the
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
gives
a
fair
possibility.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes
sir.
now,
the
arguments
made
about
mrs.
ginsburg
relating
to
the
women
are
the
discernable
group
are
equally
applicable
here
and
i
won't
burden
the
court
the
time
it
takes
to
repeat
even
though
i
couldn't
repeat
them
--
that
argument
in
a
sounded
fashion
than
mrs.
ginsburg,
i
will
adopt
those
arguments.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
from
the
standpoint
of
equal
protection
that's
probably
correct.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes
sir.
i
believe
that
it
would
because
what
reason
would
there
be
for
the
people
30
to
20
not
being
able
to
serve
on
jury.
what
possible
rationality
would
there
be
behind
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
defendant
and
within
the
20
and
30
age
group
could
well
complain
of
that
i
would
think.
thank
you.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
mr.
william
mcm.
king
just
briefly
your
honor.
hoyt
was
a
pre
duncan
case
and
this
is
the
case
i
believe
your
honor
which
asks
the
question
whether
the
application
of
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
due
process
cause
require
that
juries
be
chosen
from
a
representative
cross
section
of
the
community.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
issue
was
whether
a
jury
trial
should
be
provided
and
is
required
of
a
right
in
state
criminal
cases.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no
sir,
this
is
the
case.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it
might
not
have
been,
this
is
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no
sir,
that
why
i
think
this
is
the
case
which
squarely
presents
the
issue
to
the
court.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
correct.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
statutory
for
federal
courts
and
the
court
has
held
in
due
process
cases,
not
held
but
there
has
been
much
language
in
the
due
process
cases
which
would
have
require
a
representative
cross
section
in
the
jury
even
without
the
application
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it's
part
of
it,
yes.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
second
phase
of
it
is
that
the
jury
even
though
the
complaining
parties
such
as
thiel
is
not
a
member
of
the
excluded
class
that
he
as
a
right
to
have
that
vindicated
that
there
is
no
representative
cross
section
of
the
community
from
which
the
jury
can
be
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
as
far
as
possible
without
any
arbitrary
exclusion
particularly
of
such
a
large
class
and
that
in
volunteer.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
yes
and
we
feel
though
that
the
burden
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
your
honor
mentioned
the
burden.
we
feel
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
appellant
in
this
case
has
the
constitutional
right
to
an
impartial
jury
under
the
sixth
amendment
or
application
through
the
fourteen
amendment.
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
was
a
compelling
state
interest
for
that
exclusion
falls
not
on
us
but
on
the
state
because
taylor
has
been
deprived
in
our
opinion
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
i
believe
it
be
difficult
to
reach
a
decision
without,
i
mean
favorable
to
theil
without
overruling
that
thought
of
hoyt
which
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
the
exclusion
statute
and
the
constitutional
provisions
of
the
state
of
the
louisiana,
to
that
extent,
yes.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no
sir,
i
was
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
the
sixth
amendment
due
process.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
correct.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
correct
but
hoyt
causes
interwoven,
i
mean
what
they
said
in
hoyt
--
mr.
william
mcm.
king
no,
this
is
a
jury,
was
purely
and
simply
the
quality
of
the
jury.
mr.
william
mcm.
king
it
could
be.
