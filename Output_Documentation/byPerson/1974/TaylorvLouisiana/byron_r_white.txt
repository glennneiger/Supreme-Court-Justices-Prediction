this
is
a
criminal
case
that
comes
here
from
the
courts
of
louisiana
where
the
petitioner
taylor's
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
at
the
time
of
the
conviction
the
statutes
of
the
state
provided
that
women
would
not
be
called
for
jury
service
unless
they
had
filed
a
written
declaration
in
advance
if
they
desire
to
be
subject
to
jury
service.
the
consequence
was
that
hardly
any
women
were
called
to
serve
on
the
criminal
case
juries.
the
issue
here
is
whether
this
jury
selection
system
comports
with
the
sixth
and
the
fourteenth
amendments
to
be
--
to
the
constitution.
for
the
reasons
we
state
in
the
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
it
does
not
and
we
consequently
reverse
the
conviction
of
petitioner
taylor.
the
chief
justice
concurs
in
the
judgment
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
