chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
73-1279,
the
williams
&
wilkins
company
against
the
united
states.
mr.
latman
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
are
the
principal
constituents
of
those
libraries,
the
users?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
barriers
are
there,
if
any
to
having
a
person
who
desires
one
of
these
copies
to
write
to
the
publisher,
your
clients
got
to
copy
directly.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somewhere
in
this
massive
brief,
perhaps
in
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
there
was
a
reference
to
the
library
of
congress.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
clarify
what
it
is
s,
if
you
know,
what
is
their
practice
with
respect
to
these
furnishing
photocopies.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
it's
not
uncommon
for
judges,
members
of
this
court
and
others
to
call
on
the
library
of
congress
for
a
book,
sometimes
perhaps
it's
a
book
at
which
they
have
only
one
or
very
few
copies.
at
least
i
assume
that
because
frequently
we
get
a
request,
will
you
please
return
the
book
or
sometimes
instead
of
returning
the
book
if
we're
not
finished
with
it,
we,
speaking
personally,
i
have
like
in
chapter
13
or
chapter
14
copied
on
the
xerox
machine.
as
far
as
i
know,
the
library
of
congress
has
never
sent
photocopies
of
anything.
they
send
the
original.
is
the
borrower
running
up
against
this
statute
and
these
claims
by
making
a
copy
for
his
own
use?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
a
copyrighted
material?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
supposed
his
damage
claim,
suppose
i
have
10
copies
to
send
to
my
colleagues
so
that
we
would
all
the
sharing
in
this,
recovery
might
be
diminimous.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
no
one
would
have
any
incentive
to
sue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
level
of
complaints
rising
in
direct
proportion
to
the
number
of
photocopying
machines?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
suggest
what
is
probably
simplistic
and
hypothetical
proposition
with
a
very
obvious
answer.
i'm
sure
the
library
of
congress
has
got
copies
of
many,
many
plays
and
suppose
someone
wants
to
put
on
play,
they
write
in
and
get
one
copy
and
then
make
a
hundred
copies.
there
is
a
copyright
problem
there
for
the
use
of
that
play,
is
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
it
different
because
the
medium
of
abuse
is
different?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
it
quite
that
broad?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
it
means
he
can
have
a
copy
of
that
article
for
$0.75
instead
of
getting
it
for
nothing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
publisher
gets
some
sort
of
a
royalty.
i
don't
know
what
the
amounts
would
be,
that's
the
issue.
that's
what
we
are
here
for
a
case
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
20
years
ago,
what
would
you
guess
would
be
the
number
of
copies
that
were
furnished
out
of
the
medical
library,
if
the
medical
library
was
in
existence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
was
i
guess,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
there's
quite
a
difference
between
copying
a
couple
of
paragraphs
and
quoting
it
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
whole
thing
is
compared.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
sometimes
a
copyright
owner
will,
for
example
syndicated
columnist
or
writer
of
an
article
will
have
some
sort
of
a
footnote
saying
that
up
to
700
words
may
be
used
out
of
this
article
by
permission
of
the
copyright
owner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
suggests
that
for
many
purposes,
there's
regarded
quite
a
difference
under
copyright
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
true
that
if
the
seeker
of
this
material
could
not
get
it
free
from
the
national
library
of
medicine,
he
would
have
to
pay
something,
$0.25,
a
dollar
for
a
reprint,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
there
is
a
statute
on
record
piracy,
i
have
forgotten
the
particular
statute
that
provides
an
automatic
licensing
if
there
is
a
hit
record,
you
or
i
or
anyone
else
may,
who
are
in
the
business
of
making
records,
copy
it
without
the
consent
of
the
copyright
owner
but
we
have
to
keep
a
record,
written
record
of
how
many
copies
we
make
and
pay,
i
think
the
statute
provides
$0.05
for
each
copy.
would
that
not
be
a
feasible
mechanism
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes
we
haven't
come
to
that
point
yet
whether
the
court
has
got
any
power.
you're
going
to
discuss
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
demonstrable
proposition
or
simply
an
arguable
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
understand
the
petitioner's
position,
they
don't
want
to
curtail
the
dissemination
of
information,
medical
or
scientific
that
they
simply
want
piece
of
the
pies
that
were
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
what
you're
saying
is
that
this
can
only
be
resolved
--
this
could
not
only
be
resolved
by
congress
doing
something
like
what
they
have
done
with
the
mandatory
copying
of
records.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
latman
you
have
just
one
minute
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
latman,
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
no.
73-1279,
williams
&
wilkins
against
the
united
states,
the
judgment
under
review
is
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
