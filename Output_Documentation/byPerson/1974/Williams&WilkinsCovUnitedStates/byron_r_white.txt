justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
latman,
do
you
have
the
same
experience
with
the
private
library?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
matter
would
be
open
for
congressional
regulation
too
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
united
states
has
taken
a
position
then
that
this
simply
isn't
copying
and
that
we
don't
even
need
to
reach
the
fair
use
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
put
that
in
your
--
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
does
that
direct
you
some
of
the
history
of
the
act
and
you
never
had
--
you
have
arrived
at
this
conclusion
without
ever
having
had
a
fair
use
doctrine.
