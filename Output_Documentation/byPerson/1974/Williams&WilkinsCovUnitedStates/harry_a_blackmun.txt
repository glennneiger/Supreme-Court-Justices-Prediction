mr.
latman,
does
the
record
show
how
many
reprints
were
supplied
to
each
author
of
his
article?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
free
of
charge?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
latman,
could
i
go
back
to
my
former
question
about
reprints.
does
a
record
show
what
your
clients
charge
for
a
reprint?
does
it
depend
on
the
length
and
so
forth?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
nominal?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
ask
this
because
i
know
the
tendency
and
i
personally
think
it's
been
abused
greatly
of
the
medical
profession
at
least
and
i
think
scientists
in
general
to
request
almost
automatically
with
penny
postcards,
used
to
be
penny
postcards
for
thousands
of
reprints
literally
and
offering
to
pay
no
charge
expecting
the
author
to
supply
these
and
i
suppose
this
or
does
it
similarly
come
in
in
a
flow
to
the
publisher?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
bork,
that
doesn’t
mean
that
they
haven't
complained
about
it,
does
it
surely?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
i
can
testify
that
i
have
many
complaints
personally.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
don't
you
occasionally
have
journals
so
that
may
have
one
very
important
lead
article
that
might
comprise
say
two
thirds
of
the
journal?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it's
true
in
law
review
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
would
you
say
a
way
it
was
a
fair
use
to
copy
the
lead
article?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
won't
the
medical
library
copy
an
entire
journal?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
about
what.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
i
know
but
the
copyright
attaches
to
each
article
i
take
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
but
the
library
is
not
reluctant
to
copy
an
entire
article?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
not
talking
about
a
copyright,
not
a—
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
whether
the
subscription.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
might
as
well
copy
the
entire
magazine.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
doesn't
the
petitioner
also
sell
reprints?
