mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
throughout
most
of
this
century,
libraries
have
permitted
their
patrons
to
make
single
copies
of
articles
from
journals
or
have
made
such
articles
upon
the
requests
of
customers.
and
not
until
now,
in
this
case
has
any
publisher
or
other
copyright
holder
ever
challenged
that
well-known
practice,
that
well
known
means
of
providing
access
to
collections
in
libraries.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
have
been
remarkably
little
complaint
mr.
justice
blackmun.
but
i
think
there
has
been
some
but
i
think
the
complaint
is
generally
directed
at
practices
other
than
that
followed
by
the
national
library
of
medicine
and
nih
here.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i
think
there
has
been.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
so
mr.
chief
justice
but
i
think
the
number
of
complaints
have
to
do
with
practices
other
than
that
followed
by
the
national
library
of
medicine
and
national
institute
of
health.
one
of
the
petitioner's
modes
of
arguing
this
case
is
to
lump
together
all
photocopying
practices
with
a
quite
specific
and
limited
practices
followed
by
nlm
and
nih.
so
i
don't
think
the
kind
of
practice
we're
examining
here
today
in
this
case
is
the
kind
of
practice
that
does
any
injury
to
the
publishers
in
this
industries.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
no
doubt
mr.
chief
justice
that
that
is
clear
infringement.
that
is
a
practice
totally
unlike
the
practice
followed
by
the
national
library
of
medicine.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
it's
different
for
a
complete
variety
of
reasons,
one
is,
the
non-commercial
use
here.
another,
i
must
say
is
that
these
photocopied
articles
are
in
no
sense
substitutes
for
a
subscription
to
the
petitioner's
journals.
they
are
just
--
they
are
not
substitutes.
if
you
are
a
worker
in
a
research
field,
you
will
subscribe
and
do
subscribe
and
indeed
get
subscriptions
through
the
professional
associations
you
belong
to
of
the
main
journals
in
your
field.
and
keeping
abreast
of
your
field
on
these
developments
cannot
be
done
by
sending
off
of
the
occasional
photocopy
to
the
library
of
medicine.
so
that
what
the
library
of
medicine
provides
is
not
a
substitute
for
subscriptions
in
your
field.
what
it
does
provide
are
other
things,
it
provides
that
when
an
article
of
direct
interest
to
your
work
appears
in
a
journal
but
you
never
anticipated
it
will
appear
in
a
peripheral
journal
or
perhaps
a
journal
from
another
specialty
which
have
a
cross
feed
into
your
field.
or
perhaps
an
out
of
date
issue
of
your
own
that
you
no
longer
have.
that
is
the
kind
of
copying
the
national
library
of
medicine
does.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
might
well
not
be
fair
use,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
my
primary
answer
to
it
is
that
is
not
the
fact,
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
involves
copying
that
i
think
has
no
effect
upon
the
petitioner's
subscription
list.
something
is
happening
to
the
subscription
list
of
medical
journals
and
will
continue
to
happen
as
data
flow
through
computers
and
other
means
increases.
but
that's
not
because
the
photocopying
practices
of
the
national
library
of
medicine.
i
was
merely
pointing
out
that
the
ability
to
get
a
photocopy
is
no
substitute
for
a
subscription
to
the
journals
in
your
field.
on
the
other
hand,
you
cannot
subscribe
--
the
national
library
of
medicine
has
18,000
journals
it
subscribes
to.
one
doesn't
know
for
sure
where
in
that
range
of
journals
an
article
that
might
be
relevant
to
one's
research
will
appear
to
tell
a
man
that
he
must
subscribe
to
any
substantial
fraction,
any
small
fraction
of
that
number
of
journals
is
to
tell
him
that
he
cannot
have
the
article.
and
that
is
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
it's
not
quite
that
broad.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
on
the
--
if
we
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice
and
to
that
i
have
two
answers,
one
is
that
there
is
no
infringement
of
the
copyright
act
here
either
because
the
copyright
act
doesn't
cover
this
practice
or
because
it
is
covered
by
a
fair
use
and
i
think
that's
fairly
clear.
my
other
answer
is
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
a
status
quo
in
medical
research
which
is
enormously
complex.
this
is
not
a
problem
that
is
homogeneous.
and
the
petitioner
offers
us
a
tiny
slice
of
the
total
problem
and
asks
for
a
sweeping
rule
that
is
going
to
upset
the
status
quo
in
medical
research.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
nih
may
have
been,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
don't
know.
nih
only
furnishes
copies
to
its
own
researchers.
it
is
not
the
outside
use,
it's
the
national
library
of
medicine.
and
for
a
while
the
increase
in
photocopying
did
increase
until
about
1968
then
it
took
a
dip
and
i
think
it
is
now
back
up
somewhere
near
the
1968
level.
but
it
has
been
a
strong
factor
for
some
time
but
i
think
it's
important
for
me
to
say
that
this
has
been
a
practice
which
has
been
understood,
not
to
violate
the
copyright
act
of
1909
for
decades.
our
brief
refers
to
and
i
will
not
take
this
through
evidence
of
that,
the
gentleman's
agreement
of
1935
which
is
answered
by
a
statement
that
we're
not
bound
by
it.
nobody
suggested
the
petitioner
is
bound
by
that
agreement.
one
does
suggest
that
it
indicates
an
understanding
of
practices
at
that
time.
the
sound
and
recording
act
of
1971
which
we
discussed
in
our
brief
at
pages
18
and
19,
i
will
not
take
time
now
to
point
out
but
that
is
an
evidence
that
congress
said
two
things,
that
people
may
make
recordings
for
their
personal
use
from
copyrighted
recordings
without
violating
the
act
and
that
the
reason
they
left
people
free
to
do
that
was
that
they
didn't
want
to
give
copyright
protection
broader
than
other
holders
of
copyrights
act
which
would
seem
to
be
a
statement
by
congress
that
they
understood
the
1909
statute,
not
to
extend
to
non-commercial
copying
for
private
use
but
we
need
not,
i
think
spend
our
time
rehearsing
the
long
practice
or
taking
gleanings
from
legislative
understanding.
because
i
think
there
are
two
cases
in
this
court
that
are
quite
parallel
and
i
refer
to
fortnightly
against
--
corporation
against
united
artists
television
and
teleprompter
against
cbs.
those
were
cases
of
community
antenna
television
systems
which
went
out
and
picked
up
signals
from
stations
licensed
to
telecast
motion
picture
films,
relayed
them
to
their
own
subscribers
whom
they
charged
to
receive
these
films
and
they
paid
no
royalty
and
no
license,
no
royalty
to
or
license
form
the
owner
of
the
copyright.
now
that
was
infringement
alleged
under
sections
1(c)
and
1(d)
which
give
the
exclusive
right
to
perform
in
public
for
profit
and
perform
publicly.
now
this
court
held
that
it
must
really
decide
whether
the
catv
function
fell
upon
the
performers,
the
broadcaster
side
of
the
line
or
on
the
viewer's
side
of
the
line
and
it
said
essentially
the
catv
system
no
more
than
enhances
the
viewer's
capacity
to
receive
the
broadcaster
signal,
and
it
used
an
analogy
which
i
think
is
quite
appropriate
here.
indeed
i
think
these
two
cases
i
am
relying
upon
are
much
broader
than
anything
i
asked
this
court
to
hold
here.
this
court
said
in
fortnightly,
if
an
individual
erected
an
antenna
on
a
hill,
strung
a
cable
to
his
house
and
installed
the
necessary
amplifying
equipments,
he
would
not
be
performing
the
programs,
he
received
on
his
television
set.
the
only
difference
in
the
case
of
catv
is
an
antenna
system
is
owned
and
operated
not
by
its
users
but
by
an
entrepreneur.
the
analogy
to
this
case
is
striking.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
there
is,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that's
precisely
my
point.
i
think
we
have
the
same
kind
of
ambiguity
in
this
case
as
you
had
in
fortnightly
and
in
teleprompter.
the
reason
for
that
is
this,
we
know,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
copy
does
not
mean
that
the
making
of
any
copy
violates
the
copyright
act.
if
it
did,
there
would
be
no
doctrine
of
fair
use.
you
must
decide.
if
it
did,
there
would
not
have
been
a
long
practice
agreed
to
of
individual
persons
making
copies
for
a
variety
of
things.
so
we
know
that
one
must
construe
the
word
copy,
it
is
not
a
word
that
applies
itself
in
a
dictionary
sense.
we
know
that
about
the
act.
therefore
it
seems
to
me,
we
have
to
draw
a
distinction
much
like
that
involved
in
fortnightly
which
asked,
is
this
like
viewing
or
is
it
like
sending,
performing?
here
i
think
we
have
to
ask,
is
this
like
what
the
reader
does
properly
under
fair
use
or
is
it
like
publishing?
and
i
think
the
situations
are
quite
analogous
in
that
sense.
i
grant
that
they
construe
different
words.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
we
take
the
use
that
it
is
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
our
brief,
we
say
in
a
footnote
citing
some
other
briefs
and
some
of
these
cases
i'm
not
discussing
that
it
is
argued
persuasively
that.
the
primary
lines
of
our
brief
is
upon
fair
use.
conceptually,
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
know
that
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
because
i
learned
from
mr.
latman's
article
on
the
subject
that
the
law
is
not
entirely
clear
whether
fair
use
means
there
is
no
infringement
or
whether
fair
use
means
that
it
excused
infringement.
and
to
say
that
the
act
doesnâ€™t
cover
it
and
in
any
event
it
is
fair
use,
maybe
redundancy
or
may
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
true,
that
is
true,
that
is
true.
but
i
think
that's
inescapable
that
the
word
copy
must
be
construed
unless
we
are
prepared
to
say
that
there
is
no
doctrine
of
fair
use
for
anybody
who
copies
something
out
of
an
article
or
something
out
of
a
book.
we
know
that
is
not
the
law.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there's
quite
a
difference
[voice
overlap]
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
is
quite
a
difference.
i
think
there
is
no
difference
in
practical
result
in
this
case
because
a
couple
of
paragraphs
is
no
substitute
for
the
whole.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
or
it
may
be
regarded
as
quite
a
difference.
i
think
the
reason
the
owner
may
do
that
is
he
regards
700
words
as
not
a
substitute
for
the
whole.
and
one
of
my
points
here,
which
i
cannot
stress
too
strongly
is
that
a
reprint
of
a
single
article
is
not
a
substitute
for
what
petitioner
sells
which
is
a
journal.
the
national
library
of
medicine
will
not
xerox
that
journal,
will
not
xerox
half
of
that
journal.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
simply
--
that
may
occur
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
it
is.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
as
i
understand
the
national
library
of
medicine's
policy,
they
will
not
copy
as
much
as
half
of
the
journal.
so
i
would
guess
that
that
policy
will
not
cover
copying
all
of
such
an
article
but
i
cannot
answer
the
question
definitely.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true.
maybe
i
should
address
that
question
directly
because
i
think
the
more
important
thing
here
is
what
is
going
to
happen
to
medical
research
information
flow?
and
indeed,
information
flow
in
general,
this
case,
it
should
be
stressed
the
petitioner
is
seeking
a
flat,
sweeping
rule
which
if
applied
to
this
case
will
cover
hundreds
of
other
cases
we
know
not
of
now.
the
court
of
claims
decision
which
we
are
trying
to
uphold
is
quite
narrow,
quite
limited,
will
have
no
such
sweeping
effect
and
that
is
one
reason
i
think
the
court
of
claims
should
be
affirmed
and
congress
left
to
this
task.
and
i
must
say,
it
is
not
true
that
congress
has
not
been
addressing
this.
there
are
now
in
the
floor
of
the
house
two
bills
passed
by
the
senate.
one
of
which
would
establish
commission
to
study
this
very
problem,
the
other
of
which
addresses
this
problem
in
substantive
terms.
i
happen
to
prefer
the
commission
approach
because
this
problem
is
far
more
complex
than
we
have
given
it
credit
for
here.
there
are
any
number
of
differences
in
scholarship
and
in
subsidization
of
journals
and
in
competing
interest
here
that
are
not
reflected
in
this
record
and
cannot
be
reflected
in
a
record
of
litigation
like
this.
so
that
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i
think
the,
mr.
justice
white
that
the
reason
that
they
respect
petitioner's
copyright
interest
of
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
he
has
a
copyright
interest
on
each
article.
we
don't
--
by
the
way
there
is
a
left
open
in
this
case
a
question
of
who
does
all
these
copyrights?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
but
what
the
petition
sells
is
a
journal.
and
we
don't
thinkâ€”
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
for
the
reasons
i'm
arguing
today,
mr.
justice
white,
the
national
library
of
medicine
believes
that
it
is
not
infringing
a
copyright
when
it
does
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no
mr.
justice
white,
if
it
copied
the
entire
magazine
it
would
be
providing
a
substitute
for
what
petitioner
sells.
we
are
not
now
providing
any
such
substitute
and
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
does
sell
reprints
and
let
me
say
this
mr.
justice
blackmun,
we're
talking
here
not
just
about
the
petitioner,
we're
talking
about
five
or
600
publishers
of
medical
journals
in
very
different
circumstances.
we
are
talking
about
thousands
of
libraries.
the
petitioner
seeks
a
rule
that
will
apply
to
all
of
those
publishers
who
will
be
able,
if
they
wish
to
get
injunctions
against
private
libraries
although
not
against
the
government
libraries.
if
petitioner
gets
to
this
rule,
it
says
we
can
then
begin
negotiation.
i
can't
imagine
the
negotiation
that
would
be
involved
between
thousands
of
libraries
and
five
or
600
publishers
all
with
very
different
interests,
very
different
views
of
the
matter
and
very
different
appetites
for
gain.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
may
be
feasible
mr.
chief
justice
and
but
let
me
tell
you
why
i
think
it
ought
not
to
be
imposed
by
a
rule
of
court
rather
than
by
a
rule
of
legislature.
i've
just
suggested
a
reason
why
i
think.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
i
think
this
is
--
i
think
it's
tied
intimately
with
this
question.
i
have
just
suggested
why
i
think
that
this
proposed
solution
of
give
us
this
hard
and
fast
rule
and
we'll
go
out
there
and
negotiate
is
no
solution
because
i
think
the
negotiations
will
break
down
too
many
libraries,
too
many
other
interest
involved
so
that
what
we
have
is
an
invitation
to
chaos,
not
an
invitation
order
in
the
industry.
but
let
us
assume,
along
the
lines
of
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
that
such
an
agreement
were
possible
or
that
such
an
agreement
were
imposed
by
rule
of
court.
the
only
thing
that's
going
to
happen
immediately
is,
there
would
be
a
much
greater
burden
of
compliance
upon
libraries,
not
just
the
burden
of
the
royalties
which
will
be
quite
substantial
because
the
numbers
we're
talking
about
as
small,
happen
to
be
royalties
for
four
journals
in
one
library.
now
if
you
would
add
the
18,000
journals
in
thousands
of
libraries,
we're
talking
about
a
large
increase
in
the
cost
of
medical
research
dissemination
over
the
current
practice.
in
addition
to
that,
there
would
be
a
very
heavy
burden
of
compliance
by
the
libraries,
as
they
have
to
check
out
and
add
administrative
apparatus
to
count
photocopying
instances.
now
what
that's
going
to
mean
is,
that
the
holdings
of
libraries
around
this
country,
medical
libraries
are
on
this
country,
are
going
to
be
cut
back
sharply.
not
the
national
library
of
medicine.
the
national
library
of
medicine
i'm
sure
can
get
an
appropriation
to
pay
whatever
it
costs
and
indeed
the
national
library
of
medicine
is
now
paying
the
higher
price
for
petitioner's
journals
and
has
agreed
to
do
so.
the
national
library
of
medicine
is
going
to
cut
back
on
these
journals.
but
the
national
library
of
medicine
is
trying
to
encourage
holdings
and
has
been
encouraging
holdings.
in
fact
they
spent
12
and
a
quarter
million
dollars
for
grants
for
acquisitions
to
libraries
around
this
country,
much
of
which
has
been
on
subscriptions
for
petitioner's
other
journals.
so
it's
increasing
the
subscriptions
out
in
regional
and
local
libraries.
this
rule
the
petitioner
seeks
is
going
to
increase
the
royalties
greatly.
it's
going
to
increase
the
burdens
of
compliance
and
cost
in
libraries.
the
number
of
smaller
journals
held
by
libraries
are
going
to
be
cut
back
drastically,
even
if
they
don't
raise
their
own
subscription
price
or
try
to
license
themselves
because
library
budgets
are
going
to
be
enough.
now
maybe
that's
what
should
happen.
maybe
peripheral
journals
should
go
out
of
business.
maybe
a
darwinian
approach
to
this
thing
is
the
correct
approach.
i
merely
suggest
to
you
that
that's
a
choice
that
really
ought
to
be
made.
that's
a
change
in
the
status
quo
and
with
drastic
results
from
medical
research
dissemination
and
that's
a
choice
that
should
be
made,
i
suggest
by
the
congress
rather
than
by
a
court.
and
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
it
has
been
made
by
congress,
it's
a
choice
that
has
not
been
enforced
for
50
or
60
years
while
copying
practices
have
been
going
on
and
growing.
it's
a
choice
that
is
not
reflected
in
congress'
understanding
of
what
it
was
doing
in
the
1971
sound
recording
act.
i
don't
think
it
is
a
choice
that
has
been
made
by
congress.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true,
that
is
true.
but
i
do
think
that
one
of
the
things
this
case
is
about
on
a
fair
use
question
is
--
fair
use
is
after
all
basically
a
constitutional
doctrine.
it
says,
it
asks
whether
a
rigid,
conceptualized
application
of
the
copyright
act
would
in
fact
retard
progress
of
science
and
the
useful
arts.
and
when
i
address
to
myself
to
this
question,
i'm
talking
about
what
would
happen
to
medical
research
and
what
is
not
happening
to
petitioner
despite
his
claims.
i
am
talking
about
fair
use.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don't
--
that
is
debatable.
i
have
seen
it
debated
both
ways
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
don't
know
that
we
--
that
i
need
to
--
well
i
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
courts
have
derived
their
power
to
evolve
a
doctrine
of
fair
use
from
the
constitutional
value,
the
constitutional
principle
--
whether
or
not
the
courts
could
second
guess
congress'
decision
about
what
would
promote
rather
than
retard,
i
don't
know.
certainly
that's
not
involved
in
this
case.
but
when
i
talk
about
the
harm
to
medical
research
and
the
lack
of
harm
to
the
petitioner
and
after
all
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
shows
petitioner's
loss
of
subscription
except
form
hearsay
in
vermont.
we're
talking
(inaudible)on
this
side
of
injury
of
the
petitioner.
when
i
talk
those
two
elements,
i
am
talking
the
doctrine
of
fair
use.
the
court
of
claims
after
all
said
it
was
moved
in
this
case
by
the
fact
that
holding
for
a
petitioner
would
heavily
damage
medical
research
and
secondly,
the
petitioner
had
shown
no
damage
to
itself.
now
it
says
these
journals
may
go
out
of
business.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
that.
in
fact
there's
common
sense,
indicates
that
they
won't,
for
the
reasons
we've
talked
about,
for
the
reasons
that
photocopying
doesn't
substitute
for
subscriptions.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
i
think
its
about
as
demonstrable,
if
i
may
make
the
comparison
as
market
definition
in
antitrust
cases.
one
looks
at
these
two
things
and
it
is
apparent
in
this
industry,
photocopies
of
single
articles
serve
a
different
function,
a
different
market
than
journal
subscriptions.
they
complement,
rather
than
substitute
for
each
other
and
therefore,
i
think
are
indifferent
markets.
i
suppose,
had
this
trial
--
had
petitioner
taken
this
trial
into
the
question
of
how
much
of
him
was
injured,
we
might
have
a
record
on
these
points.
but
we
have
here
only
petitioner's
rather
dire
speculations
about
his
future.
and
that's
the
only
record
on
injury.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
they
are
bound
to
curtail
it.
if
they
get
this
rule,
we
will
then
have
a
chaotic
situation
and
negotiation
with
thousands
of
parties
in
interests.
if
that
negotiation
comes
out
the
way
they
want
it
to,
we
are
going
to
have
a
dramatic
impact
on
the
peripheral
journals,
not
upon
petitioner's
journals,
petitioner's
journals
are
not
peripheral,
libraries
will
continue
to
stock
them,
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
but,
peripheral
journals
are
going
to
find
that
library
budgets
have
shrunk
and
then
aren't
going
to
be
sold.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
or
congress
doing
something
of
that
sort
or
perhaps
making
a
solution
to
differentiate
among
the
different
interests
involved
here.
i
should
have
mentioned
that
the
library
of
congress
to
its
copyright
office
is
now
holding
conferences
including
their
national
conference
to
comment
on
effort
to
arrive
at
norms
in
this
quite
complex
situation.
nor
which
may
perhaps
be
translated
into
legislation.
i
should
also
say
one
other
thing
which
i
think
shows
how
little
petitioners
are
really
talking
about
here.
there
are
18,000
journals,
there
are
over
400,000
volumes
of
journals,
individual
issues,
volumes
of
journals
in
the
nlm
holdings.
now
in
1970,
there
were
93,000
articles
photocopied.
that
is
less
than
1/4
of
one
request
per
volume
of
journals
held.
when
you
look
at
these
things
spread
across
the
number
of
journals,
sure
there
are
men
with
microfilming
constantly
in
one
library
but
when
you
look
at
the
universe
of
what
they
are
copying
from,
and
see
the
impact
is
negligible
upon
an
individual
journal.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
that's
right
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
confess
that
i
think
that
both
of
those
breaths
are
internally
consistent,
yes.
is
negligible
--
i'm
pointing
out
that
it's
negligible
as
an
impact
upon
an
individual
journal
by
showing
how
thinly
it
is
spread
across
this
vast
storehouse
of
medical
information
in
journals.
it
is
crucial
to
individual
researchers
here
and
there
who
need
a
particular
article
in
a
far
out,
in
an
obscure
peripheral
magazine
or
in
some
other
magazine
or
in
a
back
number
they
have
lost
or
in
a
specialty
they
don't
belong
to.
for
that
research,
it
is
crucial.
at
one
end
upon
medical
research
is
quite
important,
the
effect
of
the
other
end
upon
subscriptions
to
journals
is
infinite
testimony.
if
it
exists,
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
that
it
exists.
i
think
i
would
quote
form
a
teleprompter
decision
about
the
fact
that
the
detailed
regulation
of
what's
involved
here
cannot
be
solved
really
by
litigation
and
a
flat
rule.
it
requires
something
much
more
sensitive.
and
i
suggest,
for
the
reasons
i've
given
that
both
the
law
and
the
policy
of
the
law,
press
to
the
conclusion
that
the
court
of
claims
opinion
ought
to
be
affirmed.
