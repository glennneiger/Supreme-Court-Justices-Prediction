justice
potter
stewart
is
the
ninth
circuit
case
the
gas
light
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
parity
or
the
0335
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court?
justice
potter
stewart
the
practice
used
to
be
before
the
era
of
xerox?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
know.
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
libraries,
the
national
library,
the
national
institute
of
health
before
the
early
60's
subscribed
to
more
copies
of
your
publications
than
they
now
do?
justice
potter
stewart
except,
mr.
solicitor
general,
the
whole
--
the
only
thing
to
be
decided
in
those
two
cases
was
the
meaning
of
the
word
perform
under
the
1907
act.
i
can
understand
that
casual
readers
of
the
opinion,
perhaps
particularly
the
view
of
the
dissenting
opinions
might
have
thought
that
those
cases
had
to
deal
with
something
else
but
all
they
were
directed
to,
was
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
word
performed.
and
now
here
we
have
the
statutory
word
copy
and
certainly
there
isn't
any
ambiguity
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well
i
think
that
your
brother's
point
on
the
other
side
is
that
choice
has
been
made
by
congress.
justice
potter
stewart
well
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
