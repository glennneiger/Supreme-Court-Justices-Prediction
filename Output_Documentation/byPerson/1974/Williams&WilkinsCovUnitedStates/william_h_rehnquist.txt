justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
the
doctrine
of
fair
use
ever
been
upheld
or
specifically
adopted
by
any
opinion
in
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
the
court
of
claims
said
that
--
judge
davis
said
that
the
court
didn't
have
the
power
to
compel
you
to
license
to
a
private
individual
and
while
you
might
be
willing
to
some
other
person
in
a
similar
situation
might
not.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
opinion
that
nobody
would
sue
the
chief
justice
or
that
nobody
would
sue
anyone?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
if
i
am
just
interested
in
the
first
act
of
the
macado,
i
suppose
i
can
say
the
first
act
of
the
macado
isn't
a
substitute
for
the
whole
lot
so
i'll
just
copy
the
first
act
and
it's
not
a
substitute.
would
that
be
fair
use?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
congress
would
be
constitutionally
obligated
to
incorporate
a
doctrine
of
fair
use
under
the
copyright
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
that
fair
use
was
a
constitutionally
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
in
one
breath,
you
say
the
thing
is
going
to
result
in
chaos
and
then
in
the
next
breath
you
say
how
negligible
it
is.
