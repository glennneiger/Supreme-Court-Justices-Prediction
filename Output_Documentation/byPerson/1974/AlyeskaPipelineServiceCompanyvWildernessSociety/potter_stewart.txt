justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
case
in
this
court
that
is
held
that
there
is
a
general
--
private
attorney
generals?
justice
potter
stewart
i
am
not
all
that
clear,
why
they
take
4,400
hours
to
it.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
the
law
was
--
[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
so,
on
your
theory,
why
it
would
take
your
opponent
a
good
many
hours
to
prove
that
the
statute
didn't
mean
what
it
said.
we're
talking
about
your
time.
justice
potter
stewart
and
have
there
been
any
engineering
changes
in
the
anticipation
of
the
possible
--?
justice
potter
stewart
almost
any
party
come
in
and
say
the
law
just
isn't
being
enforced.
i'm
going
to
enforce
it.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
pretty
broad
but
by
the
way
who's
going
to
--
assume
you
when
and
where
does
the
fee
go?
justice
potter
stewart
awarded
to
you,
i
thought
--
who
applied
for
fees,
you
or
the
client?
