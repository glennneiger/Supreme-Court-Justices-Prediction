mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
to
review
a
four
to
three
en
banc
decision
of
that
circuit
awarding
attorney's
fees
to
the
respondent
environmental
organizations
here.
it
arises
out
of
the
alaska
pipeline
litigation.
in
order
to
understand
the
facts
of
the
attorney's
fees
case,
it's
necessary
to
refer
briefly
to
the
underlying
litigation.
in
mid
1969,
affirmance
were
sought
from
the
department
of
interior
to
construct
the
alaska
pipeline.
these
applications
were
subsequently
amended
in
december
of
1969.
as
amended
in
december
of
1969,
they
reflected
the
anticipated
need
at
that
time
of
approximately
100
feet
in
width
in
order
to
build
this
pipeline
because
of
the
heavy
construction
equipment
which
is
required.
the
statute
involves
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
provides
for
a
right
of
way,
essentially
50
feet
plus
the
width
of
the
pipeline.
in
this
case
54
feet
of
foot
pipeline,
alyeska
in
its
december
application
sought
to
acquire
additional
space
under
department
of
interior
regulations,
and
they
are
on
the
books
for
some
years.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
alyeska.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
alyeska
is
the
correct
pronunciation,
yes
your
honor.
to
acquire
this
additional
space
as
a
special
land
use
permit,
there
was
a
provision
on
department
of
interior
regulations
for
awarding
such
permits.
now,
during
1969,
and
as
a
chronology
set
forth
in
the
appendix
here
which
reveals
that
department
of
interior
launched
what
was
at
that
time
really
an
unprecedented
effort
to
evaluate
this
pipeline
proposal,
technically
environmentally
and
what
have
you.
in
january
1,
1970,
the
national
environmental
policy
act
became
law
and
that's
commonly
referred
to
these
days
as
nepa.
in
march,
the
respondent's
file
suit
in
the
district
court.
they
filed
suit
only
against
the
secretary
of
interior.
and
alyeska
our
client,
the
petitioner
here
and
the
state
of
alaska
did
not
become
parties
to
the
litigation
until
approximately
18
months
thereafter
when
they
intervened.
there
were
two
distinct
claims
in
the
complaint.
first
of
all
was
that
the
applicants
were
limited
to
54
feet
in
width
and
the
secretary
of
interior
had
no
authority
to
give
them
more
under
the
special
land
use
permit
to
regulations
or
otherwise.
secondly,
that
the
department
of
interior
had
not
yet
complied
with
nepa
which
requires
federal
officials
to
consider
environmental
values
and
to
file
so-called
environmental
impact
statements
for
major
projects.
preliminary
injunction
issued
in
april
1970.
after
that
time,
the
department
of
interior
continued
to
asses
the
technical
and
environmental
aspects
of
the
pipeline
and
also
began
preparing
the
environmental
impact
statement
required
by
nepa.
this
statement
was
issued
for
public
comment
in
march
of
1972
and
in
may
of
1972,
secretary
morton
indicated
his
decision
to
award
the
permits
including
the
special
land
use
permits
which
were
challenged
by
respondents.
the
legal
issues
involved
were
then
litigated
in
the
district
court
in
august
of
1972
and
the
respondents
were
unsuccessful
on
all
issues.
the
district
judge
who
would
enter
the
preliminary
injunction
lifted
that
injunction.
an
appeal
then
ensued
to
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
there
the
respondents
prevailed
on
the
mineral
leasing
act
claim
or
that
part
of
their
claim,
that
related
to
the
special
land
use
permits.
the
court
did
not
decide
the
nepa
issues
which
had
also
been
litigated
in
the
district
court.
three
of
the
judges
however,
expressed
a
view
that
those
issues
ought
to
be
decided
and
that
the
secretary's
efforts
complied
with
nepa.
certiorari
was
sought
to
this
court
and
was
denied.
thereafter,
respondents
filed
a
bill
for
cost
and
attorney's
fees
with
the
court
of
appeals,
sought
attorney's
fees
only
against
alyeska,
one
of
the
three
defendants
and
sought
such
fees
only
for
a
period
beginning
approximate
to
the
time
of
the
release
of
the
final
environmental
impact
statement
in
march
'72,
did
not
seek
any
fees
with
a
period
in
which
the
preliminary
injunction
was
sought
or
obtained.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
well,
it
wasn't
throughout
the
litigation
but
it
covered
such
things
for
example
as
obtaining
expert
comment
on
the
environmental
impact
statement,
they
submitted
four
volumes
of
comments
to
the
secretary
of
interior
as
part
of
the
public
comments,
preparation
of
the
mineral
leasing
act
brief,
preparation
of
the
briefs
in
connection
with
the
nepa
issues.
now,
they
did
not
specifically
make
a
claim
for
the
presentation
in
the
district
court.
however,
the
same
briefs
were
used
in
the
court
of
appeals,
somewhat
unusual
procedure
but
the
exact
briefs
were
used
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
were
used
in
the
district
court
so
all
the
work
that
had
been
involved
in
doing
the
briefs
was
initially
done
for
the
district
court,
then
used
thereafter
in
the
court
of
appeals.
meanwhile,
congress
had
began
to
consider
legislation
to
solve
the
problems
created
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
that
legislation
resulted
in
public
law
93-153
which
amended
the
mineral
leasing
act
and
generally
with
respect
to
rights
of
way
but
it
did
more
than
that.
it
contained
specific
provisions
regarding
the
alaska
pipeline
and
it
directed
issuance
of
all
the
necessary
permits
for
the
line.
specifically
said
that
there
would
be
no
further
compliance
required
with
nepa
and
this
in
effect
was
a
rejection
of
what
had
been
the
respondent's
principal
contention
in
all
of
late
1971
and
1972,
namely
the
secretary
of
interior
had
to
consider
a
comment
carter
of
pipelines
through
canada
rather
than
through
alaska.
it
also
precluded
judicial
review
for
--
except
for
constitutional
claims
and
even
for
those
provided
direct
appeal
from
a
one-judge
district
court
to
this
court.
after
this
legislation
was
enacted,
the
court
of
appeals
granted
the
request
for
award
of
attorney's
fees
against
alyeska.
the
award
was
based
on
what
we
view
as
a
considerably
expanded
concept
of
the
private
attorney
general
doctrine
which
some
lower
courts
had
embraced.
and
although
the
majority
conceded
that
alyeska
had
not
violated
any
duty,
and
no
duties
were
imposed
on
alyeska
by
the
two
statutes
which
were
in
question
and
nonetheless
awarded
fees
against
alyeska.
this
decision
is
on
direct
conflict
with
the
sierra
club
versus
lyng
the
fifth
circuit
which
is
printed
as
an
appendix
to
our
brief
here,
certiorari
was
then
granted
by
this
court.
now
our
principal
arguments
in
seeking
reversal
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
are
these.
first,
it
is
our
position
at
the
fifth
circuit
held
in
sierra
club
versus
lyng
that
it
is
not
equitable
to
award
fees
against
the
party
who
violated
no
duty
and
who
could
not
control
the
acts
of
those
upon
whom
the
duties
were
imposed
by
law.
second,
the
court's
unwilling
to
rule
on
that
basis.
we
contend
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
an
improper
concept
of
the
private
attorney
general
doctrine
if
indeed
there
is
to
be
a
private
attorney
general
doctrine.
specifically
it
was
wrong
to
award
fees
on
the
mineral
leasing
act
aspects
of
the
case
because
that
width
provision
on
the
mineral
leasing
act
was
not
something
which
reflected
peculiar
or
unique
congressional
concern.
and
secondly,
it
was
wrong
to
award
fees
with
respect
to
the
nepa
issues
on
which
respondents
did
not
prevail
in
the
district
court,
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
the
congress.
now
it's
our
contention
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
here
is
a
major
extension
of
the
private
attorney
general
doctrine
that
it
will
stimulate
a
greatly
increased
amount
of
litigation
on
the
federal
courts
involving
both
environmental
laws
and
hundreds
of
other
federal
statutory
provisions,
that
there
will
be
collateral
litigation
concerning
the
scope
of
this
expanded
somewhat
indefinite
private
attorney
general
exception.
and
that
so
unconstrained
on
exception
raises
serious
questions
of
legitimate
concern
to
this
court
about
the
proper
role
of
the
judiciary,
as
distinguished
from
the
congress
in
saying
which
federal
statutes
are
so
important
that
attorney's
fees
ought
to
be
awarded
to
support
their
policies.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
there
is
no
such
case,
there
was
a
reference
to
the
private
attorney
general
doctrine
in
newman
versus
piggie
park
enterprises
but
that
was
a
statutory
case
under
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
and
it
was
more
--
the
court
was
effectively
creating
a
presumption
in
favor
of
attorney's
fees
on
one
of
the
statute
there.
the
court
noted
last
term
in
the
rich
versus
united
states
case
that
hadn't
passed
on
that
private
attorney
general
concept.
the
court
has
noted
in
various
footnotes
that
other
courts
have
discussed
such
a
concept.
before,
i
get
to
this
principal
arguments,
let
me
put
to
rest
a
couple
of
matters
which
were
raised
by
respondent's
brief.
first,
respondent
seem
here
to
be
trying
to
suggest
that
alyeska
was
guilty
in
consort
with
the
secretary
of
interior
of
deliberately
lawless
conduct
and
seeking
special
land
used
permits
as
an
adjunct
to
a
right
of
way
under
the
mineral
leasing
act.
this
simply
cannot
be
supported,
even
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
conceded
at
the
mineral
leasing
act
argument
of
alyeska
and
the
secretary
was
and
i
quote
“manifestly
reasonable
and
assumed
in
good
faith
particularly
in
view
of
a
long
administrative
practice
supporting
it.”
secondly,
the
respondents
argue
that
their
activities
support
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
under
a
kind
of
common
benefit
theory
which
this
court
has
approved
in
cases
such
as
mills
versus
electric
auto-lite
and
hall
versus
cole.
but
the
court
of
appeals
examined
that
theory
too
and
said
in
effect
that
if
you're
going
to
apply
the
common
benefit
exception
of
this
case,
you'd
have
to
take
that
exception
and
i
quote
“stretch
it
totally
outside
its
basic
rationale.”
the
court
also
noted
that
imposing
attorney's
fees
on
alyeska
will
not
operate
to
spread
the
cause
of
litigation
proportionally
among
the
beneficiaries,
the
key
requirement
of
the
common
benefit
theory.
and
on
this
regard,
the
dc
circuit
has
an
agreement
with
the
reasoning
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
sierra
club
versus
lynn.
let
me
turn
now
to
really
our
principal
argument
and
that
is
the
fact
that
alyeska
has
been
held
to
answer
attorney's
fees
for
asserted
violations
of
the
duty
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
the
argument
is
really
quite
simple.
first,
the
respondents
made
two
arguments
in
the
litigation
earlier
that
the
secretary
lacked
authority
to
give
permits
to
alyeska
in
connection
with
the
right
of
way
and
secondly
that
the
secretary
did
not
adequately
comply
with
his
responsibilities
under
nepa
which
requires
environmental
statements
and
public
comment
and
circulation
among
federal
agencies.
the
suit
was
brought
only
against
the
secretary.
no
claim
was
ever
made
that
alyeska
violated
any
duty.
the
court
of
appeals
explicitly
recognized
that
the
duties
were
those
of
the
secretary.
now
despite
this,
the
court
of
appeals
went
on
and
awarded
the
attorney's
fees
against
alyeska
because
of
its
substantial
participation
under
litigation
which
i
cannot
deny
and
because
of
the
massive
nature
of
its
interests.
in
our
view,
the
participation
in
the
litigation
and
the
massivity
of
alyeska's
interest
is
simply
not
the
point
here.
the
point
is
as
the
fifth
circuit
has
recognized,
alyeska
was
innocent
of
any
wrong
doing
and
yet
it
has
been
held
responsible
with
regard
to
attorney's
fees.
let
me
turn
now
if
i
can
to
the
private
attorney
general
doctrine.
that's
the
doctrine
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
rested
its
decision
in
this
case
and
plainly
did
so.
now,
we
contend
that
if
there's
to
be
a
private
attorney
general
doctrine
which
mr.
justice
stewart
colloquy
pointed
out,
this
court
has
never
really
approved.
it
ought
to
be
confined
in
some
way
which
makes
it
manageable.
one
way
to
do
that
would
be
to
confine
it
to
cases
involving
either
constitutional
rights
or
rights
which
are
created
by
statutes
which
implement
and
intend
to
give
substantive
rights
under
constitutional
provisions.
and
it
all
further
be
limited
to
plaintiffs
who
prevail
in
a
practical
if
not
a
technical
sense.
let's
look
into
what
the
courts
have
in
fact
done
with
the
private
attorney
general
exceptions.
the
brief
of
the
respondents
here
footnote
91,
sets
forth
a
host
of
private
attorney
general
cases.
there
are
28
there
where
fees
were
actually
awarded.
when
you
look
at
those,
you'll
find
that
26
of
them
involve
either
constitutional
claims
or
claims
under
implementing
statutes
to
constitutional
provisions
such
as
42
u.s.c.,
sections
1981,
1982,
1983.
only
one
case
involves
an
environmental
claim
that's
the
la
raza
unida
case
in
california
district
court
case.
and
there's
another
case
in
california
involving
an
antitrust
claim
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
now,
24
of
the
plaintiffs
in
these
28
cases
had
achieved
success
on
the
merits.
and
four
of
the
plaintiffs
had
achieved
substantially
the
same
thing
in
the
form
of
a
consent
decree.
in
no
case
does
it
appear
at
least
as
we
can
1547
from
the
opinions
that
the
fees
were
awarded
against
the
party
without
responsibility
for
our
duty.
in
other
words,
a
party
which
did
not
had
some
violation
of
a
duty.
now,
with
respect
to
the
sort
of
the
important
statute
argument,
the
mineral
leasing
act
with
provision
of
the
1920
act
simply
cannot
qualify
as
an
important
statute.
the
committee
reports
in
connection
with
the
passage
of
what
was
then
section
28
of
the
1920
act
don't
even
mention
the
width
limitation
nor
do
committee
reports
of
similar
statutes
have
been
kicking
around
the
congress
in
1914
to
1920.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
my
position
or
our
position
here
is
that
court
ought
not
to
be
doing
that.
that
is
unmanageable.
but
if
you're
going
to
say
this
one
is
important,
then
essentially
everything
is
important
or
if
you're
not
going
to
say
that
what
you're
going
to
apply
to
this
one
and
you've
got
to
pick
and
choose
and
say,
“well,
we
think
this
one
is
important
that
we
think
congress
thought
that
this
one
was
important.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
well,
i
think
that
that
could
be
but
i
think
you
have
to
look
to
how
congress
viewed
it,
not
how
the
courts
view
and
you
want
to
look
for
some
object
determination
of
what
congress
thought
about
the
time
passed
it.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
well,
i
agree
with
your
analysis
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
i
would
say
these,
you
know
that
you
can
kind
to
go
one
way
or
the
other.
one
way
is
to
say
all
federal
statutes
justify
attorney's
fees
awards.
that
is
essentially
an
abandoned
one
of
the
normal
american
rule
of
non-award
or
you
can
say
none
do.
now,
a
lot
of
lower
courts
and
particularly
the
fifth
circuit
and
district
courts
in
the
fifth
circuit
have
said
it's
justified
in
certain
types
of
cases
and
i
take
the
civil
rights
act
of
‘64
and
‘68
and
the
voting
rights
act
and
so
forth.
and
they
find
other
provisions,
most
of
them
enacted
during
the
reconstruction
the
year
after
the
civil
war
and
say,
“these
are
closely
related.
they're
in
the
same
ballpark
and
we'll
apply
it
to
suits
under
these
statutes.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
some
titles
do
such
as
title
ii.
but
i
recognized
that
the
courts
have
applied
it
elsewhere.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it's
not
best
to
say
whether
there
ought
to
be
a
private
attorney
general
exception.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
well,
the
opinions
of
this
court
have
often
--
attorney's
fees
have
often
made
reference
to
that
general
equitable
power.
i
would
say
this
about
that.
and
if
you
turn
the
lower
federal
courts
lose
and
say,
“the
federal
statute
is
important
as
the
mineral
leasing
act,
you
can
award
attorney's
fees
and
your
general
equitable
powers.
you
essentially
abolish
the
american
doctrine
with
respect
to
non-award
of
attorney's
fees
giving
due
recognition,
the
importance
of
federal
statutes
in
the
federal
courts.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
well,
we
don't
think
it
should
work
one
way
but
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
his
opinion
and
judge
wright
said,
“it's
okay
to
award
the
attorney's
fees
against
alyeska
because
they
have
such
a
massive
interest
that
they
couldn't
possibly
be
deterred
from
bringing
the
litigation.
on
the
other
hand,
it
wouldn't
work
the
other
way
around
so
there's
a
lack
of
mutuality
there
which
the
--
which
judge
wright
conceded.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
no,
it
certainly
will
not
apply
to
ford
foundation
but
you
know
--
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
well,
let's
put
it
this
way.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
well
there
maybe
judgment
proof
mr.
justice
marshall,
that
that
may
be
a
possibility.
but
there's
no
indication
that
the
organization's
involved
here
or
in
that
category.
we
do
think
that
there's
a
difficulty
with
this
--
the
lack
of
mutuality.
and
we
basically
think
that
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
ought
not
to
get
in
the
business
to
try
and
to
pick
and
choose
between
statutes.
if
you
want
to
have
a
private
attorney
general
doctrine
that
recognizes
civil
rights
and
civil
rights
to
derived
cases,
that
possibly
is
a
manageable
distinction.
if
you
start
extending
it
beyond
constitutional
rights,
it's
hard
to
see
where
you
draw
the
line.
let
me
say,
a
minute
here
about
the
nepa
claims.
as
to
those
that
simply
clear
that
respondents
have
not
prevailed.
there
has
been
no
ruling
on
nepa.
the
district
court
judge
found
for
the
petitioners,
the
three
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
who
expressed
an
opinion
said,
“nepa
was
satisfied
by
the
secretary
and
congress
has
rejected
the
nepa
claims.”
hence
it
just
cannot
be
a
valid
private
attorney
general
claim
based
on
the
nepa
aspects
of
the
litigations.
i
would
point
out
there
that
even
congress
in
passing
links
such
as
title
ii
of
the
civil
rights
act
with
its
attorney's
fees
provisions
has
made
distinctions
about
prevailing
and
not
prevailing.
the
title
ii
provision
requires
that
the
party
prevail.
there
are
some
other
federal
statutes
that
do
not
make
that
distinction.
but
even
on
something
as
important
as
the
civil
rights
act,
congress
at
least
as
required
that
the
party
prevail.
now,
there
are
a
couple
of
additional
things
about
the
benefits
rationale
that
fit
in
with
the
business
of
success.
let
me
add
a
couple
of
thoughts
on
those.
first
of
all,
most
of
the
specific
benefits
claimed
here
are
result
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
alyeska
wasn't
a
party
then,
didn't
become
a
party
for
about
another
16
months.
and
yet
perhaps
70%
of
what's
claimed
here
really
relates
to
the
attack
on
the
final
environmental
impact
statement.
therefore,
no
relationship
between
the
fees
claimed
and
the
benefits
claimed.
and
secondly,
respondents
claim
that
it's
their
litigation
and
their
activities
which
have
reduced
these
various
changes
in
the
construction
plans
for
the
pipeline.
this
was
a
great
benefit
of
the
country
and
to
alyeska.
this
just
isn't
supported
by
the
record.
and
let
me
take
this
one
example
which
i
pick
from
the
brief
of
respondents
to
illustrate
this.
talk
about
buried
and
elevated
pipeline,
that's
important
because
in
firm
or
frost
soil,
if
you
bury
a
hot
pipeline
in
the
wrong
places
of
the
soil,
it
will
fall
and
it
will
slump
and
it
may
damage
the
pipeline
and
could
damage
the
environment.
everyone
agrees
that
this
is
true
and
you
have
to
be
careful
about
it.
but
there's
no
element
of
the
whole
pipeline
business.
the
department
of
interior
was
more
aware
of
and
more
concerned
about.
that
concern
goes
back
to
the
latter
half
in
1969.
it
antedates
nepa.
it
antedates
the
suit
by
several
months.
in
december
of
1969,
secretary
heckel
wrote
to
chairman
jackson
of
the
senate
of
the
interior
committee,
pointing
out
that
an
interior
study
had
showed
there
were
great
problems
with
these
and
there
were
great
many
unresolved
problems.
the
day
before
this
suit
was
brought,
march
25,
1970,
the
director
of
the
geological
survey
who
was
later
to
become
undersecretary
of
interior
had
a
long
involvement
with
this
whole
pipeline
problem.
sent
a
memorandum
to
secretary
heckel
saying,
“i've
got
a
studying
for
my
staff
people.
this
is
very
troublesome,
there
are
lot
of
problems
here.
a
lot
more
of
the
lines
are
going
to
half
to
be
buried.
there's
no
way
around
it.
and
yet
respondents
were
trying
to
claim
credit
for
these
and
various
other
things
which
were
the
products
of
the
activities
of
a
host
of
government
officials.
now,
those
things
i've
just
mentioned
are
in
the
record.
they
are
attached
to
the
affidavits
that
were
submitted
and
on
march
30,
1970
the
district
court
--
those
affidavits
are
referred
to
in
the
appendix
at
page
12
and
we're
talking
about
exhibit
19
to
the
horton
deposition
and
exhibit
b
to
the
per
core
deposition.
we
just
don't
think
that
the
claims
of
credit
can
be
justified
by
the
facts.
for
these
reasons
and
those
set
forth
in
our
brief
mr.
chief
justice,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
district
court
circuit
should
be
reversed.
mr.
robert
e.
jordan,
iii
a
few
further
observations
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
be
difficult
to
persuade
mr.
flannery
of
our
good
faith
but
i
hope
i'll
do
a
better
job
with
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
our
position
was
taken
in
good
faith
in
view
of
the
law
in
administrative
practice.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
a
few
additional
things.
the
practice
of
special
land
use
permits
was
supported
by
opinions
of
the
attorney
general
going
back
in
to
the
1870's.
department
of
interior
had
regulations
on
special
land
use
permits
for
many
years.
perhaps
most
significant,
in
1923,
three
years
after
the
mineral
leasing
act
was
enacted,
there
began
a
practice
of
giving
in
fact
more
land
and
the
statute
literally
allowed
for
the
purpose
of
pumping
stations.
but
that
have
been
done
for
approximately
50
years
when
this
litigation
came
along.
that
had
been
codified
in
the
interior
regulations
and
it
been
expanded
to
include
not
only
pumping
stations
but
other
necessary
facilities.
now
that's
an
element
of
our
good
faith.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
this
argument
with
respect
to
pumping
stations
and
rejected
the
argument
of
the
respondents
on
that
point.
and
finally
i
would
say
that
in
1970,
the
ninth
circuit
had
decided
a
case
sierra
club
versus
hickel
433
fd
2d.
24
which
was
subsequently
before
this
court
on
the
name
of
sierra
club
versus
morton
on
the
basis
of
standing
issue
and
resolved
on
the
basis
of
standing
issue.
the
ninth
circuit
had
allowed
as
an
alternative
holding
the
department
of
agriculture
to
tack
if
you
will
special
land
used
permits
onto
a
specific
acreage
limitation
for
recreation
developments
on
the
mineral
king
development.
now
mr.
justice
blackmun
had
something
to
say
about
that
when
the
case
was
up
before
this
court
but
the
point
was
that
1970
is
relevant
time,
we
were
relying
on
that
kind
of
opinion
from
the
ninth
circuit
on
a
very
closely
related
point.
other
discussions
here
about
relative
portions
of
the
fees
for
various
activities,
like
to
just
reemphasize
the
point
i
made
in
my
principal
argument.
the
benefit
which
mr.
flannery
claims
were
benefits
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
now
presumably,
no
fees
were
sought
for
that
because
there
was
no
deep
pocket
there
to
go
after.
alyeska
was
not
applied
to
the
litigation
of
the
time
the
preliminary
injunction
did
not
become
so
for
many
months.
but
most
of
the
fees
claim
and
certainly
the
fees
claimed
relating
to
the
nepa
issues
are
of
a
nature
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
benefits
involving
changing
the
pipe
line
construction
that
had
already
taken
place
largely
by
march
of
1972
when
the
final
environmental
statement
came
up
and
most
of
that
related
the
trans
canadian
alternative.
now
the
district
court,
the
transcript
of
august
14,
15,
1972
when
these
issues
were
argued,
just
before
lunch
one
of
those
days.
judge
hart
asked
the
respondents
here,
what
do
you
really
want?
what
is
it
you
want
this
court
to
do
in
a
way
of
an
order?
come
back
after
lunch
and
tell
me.
and
that's
the
transcript
of
that
proceeding
which
is
referred
to
in
appendix
at
31.
after
lunch,
respondents
came
back
and
said
“what
we
really
want
here
is
an
addendum
to
the
final
environmental
impact
statement
dealing
with
these
common
carter
pipeline
arrangements
through
canada
and
alaska.”
that's
what
the
whole
nepa
exercise
was
about,
that's
what
respondents
were
seeking
at
that
time
and
it
has
nothing
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
bringing
about
changes
in
the
construction
of
the
pipeline.
one
more
point,
with
respect
to
who
brought
about
these
changes.
the
record
is
not
very
satisfactory
on
this
and
the
reason
of
course
is
that
thing
was
initially
determined
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
instance,
was
not
before
the
district
court.
and
the
record
that
we
have
here
was
not
designed
to
shed
light
on
the
attorney's
fees
issues.
but
if
you
were
to
go
back
to
the
record,
you
would
find
document
after
document
after
document
that
supports
the
notion
that
people
like
oscar
furrence
(ph)
and
reuben
catch
a
door
and
of
the
geological
survey
where
the
people
who
brought
about
the
changes
on
burying
an
elevation.
bob
page
of
the
geological
survey
was
a
fellow
who
was
in
there
saying
time
after
time
again
you
got
a
more
closely
examined
the
seismic,
the
earthquake
problem
and
there's
example
after
example
that
that
could
be
given.
so
the
idea
that
there
is
a
great
contribution
here
is
really
one
of
the
self
congratulation
i
think
and
would
not
be
supported
on
my
detailed
examination
on
the
record.
with
respect
to
the
powers
of
equity,
we're
not
challenged
about
the
power
of
this
court.
we're
not
talking
about
power.
we're
talking
about
wisdom
here.
how
should
the
equity
power
be
exercised?
we
say
it
should
not
be
exercised
against
the
party
who
was
guilty
of
no
wrong
doing
and
we
say
further
that
it
should
not
be
exercised
to
create
the
kind
of
open
ended
private
attorney
general
exception
which
is
reflected
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
