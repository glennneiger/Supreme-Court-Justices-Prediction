chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1977,
alyeska
pipeline
against
the
wilderness
society.
mr.
attorney
general
if
you
or
your
friend
would
like
to
supplement
and
clarify
that
situation
may
do
so,
file
a
letter
to
the
clerk
and
of
course
a
copy
to
opposing
counsel.
mr.
jordan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose,
mr.
jordan
that
if
we
had
a
broad
equity
approach,
we
might
then
say
that
if
someone
on
the
posture
of
the
wilderness
society
brought
litigation
of
this
kind
and
lost,
that
attorney's
fees
could
be
taxed
against
them,
the
equity
power
can't
be
one
that
works
just
one
way,
could
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
same
could
be
set
to
afford
foundation.
for
example,
if
it
brought
some
law
suits,
every
sources
were
probably
an
excessive,
that
of
the
most
private
corporations
in
the
country,
that
rationale
wouldn't
apply
to
ford
foundation,
would
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
jordan,
mr.
flannery.
chief

4,470
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
this
to
be
lift
up
to
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statutes
forbid
any
levy
against
the
government,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
given
all
your
positions
in
the
case,
the
secretary
had
acted
properly
and
performed
his
duty
on
your
theory,
the
matter
would
have
been
exposed
a
long
time
ago,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
for
18
months
at
least,
the
secretary
was
from
your
point
of
view
again
in
error
on
his
own,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
this
record
show
in
its
present
state
on
what
the
portion
of
the
total
4,400
hours
of
legal
work
have
the
impact
that
you
argue
for
on
the
actions
of
congress,
the
subsequent
actions
of
congress.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
substantial
part?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
pipeline
that
will
be
built
differs,
would
you
tell
us
in
what
way
from
one
that
was
originally
proposed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
flannery
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
that
case
was
decided,
there
was
a
substantial
body
of
precedent
in
state
courts
and
the
exercise
of
equity
powers
on
the
theory
that
there
was
a
benefit
conferred
or
a
fund
created,
was
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
little
puzzled
by
your
prior
statement
--
your
earlier
statement
at
the
outset
that
you
didn't
think
your
friend
was
disagreeing
too
much
with
you.
i
thought
he
had
disagreed
with
you
most
violently
and
said
there
was
utterly
no
precedent
whatever
of
any
kind
for
the
allowance
of
attorney's
fee's
in
cases
of
this
kind.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
precedent
in
this
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
equity
power
that
you
speak
of
are
broad
enough,
so
but
if
you
had
hypothetically
a
case
where
a
volunteer
non-profit
organization
rather
sued
and
had
litigation
that
kept
on
going
for
many,
many
months,
for
the
extra
ordinary
amount
of
time
involved.
but
then
was
found
you
had
no
basis
at
all
for
the
case
and
all
the
relief
denied,
do
you
think
the
court
would
have
the
authority
and
appropriately
charged
fees
against
plaintiff
in
the
acts
involved?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
there
is
tax
payer
money
in
there
and
in
the
broad
sense
that
donations,
contributions
to
wilderness
society,
a
tax
deductible.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
unidentifiable
portion
of
it
is
the
money
that
otherwise
would
have
gone
on
tax.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
bring
up
a
question
that
probably
is
irrelevant
but
if
none
of
the
lawyers
received
any
of
this
--
the
lawyers
have
all
been
paid
for
their
services.
but
then
as
the
matter
of
arithmetic,
i
suppose
the
center
will
be
receiving
more
money
as
a
result
of
this
litigation
than
the
center
paid
out
to
the
lawyers
who
conducted
this.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
sense
the
equity
doctrine
that
was
first
articulated
here
a
hundred
years
ago
was
always
based
on
restoring
the
expense
of
litigation,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
one
made
any
profit
out
of
it,
except
the
sense
that
lawyers
got
fees,
but
no
one
had
any
margin
in
the
old
equity
rule.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
gets
us
into
some
rather
subjective
factors.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
might
add.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
thesis
might
be
equally
applicable
to
cases
where
the
government
brings
an
action.
let's
say
any
trust
or
other
the
enforcement
in
some
economic
area
and
the
government
then
sought
fees
from
the
losing
party
and
made
the
claim
that
generally
known
in
the
profession
of
lawyers
in
the
department
of
justice
are
working
for
less
than
they
could
get
outside
and
therefore
the
difference
should
go
under
the
government's
covers,
but
has
any
court
ever
allowed
the
government
that
kind
of
cost
of
litigation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
jordan,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
white.
