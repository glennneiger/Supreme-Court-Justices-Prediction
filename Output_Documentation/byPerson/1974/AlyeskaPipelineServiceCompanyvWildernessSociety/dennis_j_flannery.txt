mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
it
has
not
your
honor.
that
is
specifically
have
been
left
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
a
later
determination.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
yes,
they
were
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
the
total
hours
were
something
over
4000
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
right
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
we
claimed
4,400
hours.
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
half
of
that
should
not
be
recovered
because
they
thought
it
would
be
appropriate
to
divide
the
award
between
the
government
and
alyeska.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
well,
i
cannot.
i
mean
they
didn't
really
get
into
the
question
of
the
hours
and
size.
they
said
that
the
question
of
the
hours
and
skill
and
the
other
points
would
be
deferred
for
later
consideration.
but
it
did
say
one-half
of
the
total
effort
that
were
taken
in
preparing
a
case
for
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
awarded
against
alyeska,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
no,
borne
by
the
organization,
the
organizations
involved,
the
wilderness
society
and
the
lawyers
will
swallow
that.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
we
did
not
go
behind
the
statute.
we
accepted
that
as
a
prohibition
and
maybe
contention
that
we
thought
is
was
fair
in
this
case
to
award
the
entire
4000
hours
against
alyeska.
the
court
disagreed
with
us
on
that
and
said
they
thought
a
half
an
award
would
be
appropriate.
listening
to
my
good
friend
mr.
jordan's
argument
and
reading
his
brief,
at
least
i
sort
of
get
the
picture
of
a
poor
harmless
soul
who
was
walking
pass
the
us
courthouse
one
day
and
a
big
hook
came
in.
and
the
next
thing
he
do,
he
was
taxed
with
fees.
and
that's
really
not
the
way
this
happened.
just
briefly
to
go
back
a
little
bit,
the
oil
companies
that
mr.
jordan
represents
discovered
and
got
rights
to
this
vast
amount
of
oil
on
the
north
slope
of
alaska.
and
then
they
had
to
determine
how
to
get
it
to
market.
they
looked
and
they
considered
various
plans
and
they
determined
that
the
way
they
would
like
to
do
it
is
to
construct
a
hot
oil
pipeline
across
the
entire
length
of
alaska
and
then
to
load
the
oil
when
it
got
to
the
bottom
of
alaska
on
marine
tankers
and
then
shipped
the
oil
to
market.
that
was
their
decision.
nobody
told
them
to
build
it
that
way.
no
one
told
them
they
had
to
do
it
that
way.
they
then
set
it
out
determining
how
they
would
go
about
getting
permission
to
do
that
since
most
of
the
lands
that
would
be
crossed
will
be
federal
lands.
the
record
clearly
indicates
that
alyeska
recognized
that
the
statute
and
my
god,
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
clear
statute.
the
statute
says
on
its
face
that
rights
of
way
will
be
limited
to
50
feet.
not
only
does
it
say
that,
it
then
says
that
the
secretary
cannot
grant
rights
of
way
under
any
other
provision.
and
if
that
isn't
enough,
it
says,
“and
if
he
does,
and
if
a
right
of
way
is
limited
or
is
issued
that
violates
the
statute,
the
oil
company
that
receives
the
right
of
way
will
forfeit
it.”
this
was
the
statute
on
its
face.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
your
honor
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
we
think
the
case
should
have
ended
in
april
of
1970
when
we
received
the
preliminary
injunction.
when
alyeska
came
in,
it
filed
i
think
about
a
200-page
brief
finally,
ultimately
trying
to
justify
why
the
statute
didn't
say
what
it
said.
it
went
pass
through
200
years
of
history
of
internal
interior
department
regulation.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
yes.
and
i
think
we
had
to
more
or
less
do
the
same
thing
to
show
not
only
did
it
say
what
it
said
on
its
face
but
it
meant
that
--
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
indicated
why
we
had
to
do
that.
judge
wright,
after
saying
that
the
statute
was
as
clear
as
it
could
be
said,
but,
it
may
well
be
that
50
feet
couldn't
have
meant
50
feet
and
we
will
go
beyond
and
the
court
went
beyond
all
of
the
other
factors
that
looked
to
the
interior
department
of
regulation.
indeed,
your
honor
it
found
that
on
the
face
of
the
regulations,
not
only
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
the
kinds
of
permits
contemplated
here
were
banned.
it
found
no
long
standing
administrative
practice
and
we
anticipated
and
it
happened
that
the
oil
companies
with
their
resources
joined
up
with
the
government,
calling
the
field
offices
of
the
interior
department
around
the
country
looking
for
any
shred
of
evidence
that
might
give
them
an
indication
that
this
was
a
long
standing
practice.
there
was
none.
when
the
record
finally
came
down
after
these
three
years,
mr.
jordan
and
his
--
and
the
government
came
up
with
actually
five
documented
instances
of
this
kind
of
permit
that
they
claim
constitute
a
long
standing
practice
and
none
of
them
before
1960.
and
i
think
the
total
miles
involved
were
around
50
or
60-mile.
but
for
some
reason,
the
oil
companies
did
not
want
to
go
to
congress.
at
any
time
in
the
three
years
of
this
litigation
was
filed,
the
oil
companies
were
free
to
go
to
congress.
no
one
stopped
them
from
doing
it
and
in
fact
the
theme
of
wilderness
society,
one
is
that
this
was
a
prescription
that
was
directed
to
the
oil
industry.
and
congress
specifically
said
if
the
oil
industry
wants
more
land
and
should
come
back
to
us
and
tell
us
why.
and
alyeska
was
not
compelled
to
go
to
the
secretary
of
interior.
it
could
have
read
as
we
read
the
preliminary
injunction
in
1970,
and
at
that
point
gone
to
congress.
it
could
have
gone
to
congress
at
anytime
and
therefore
this
litigation
certainly
didn't
burden
the
courts.
the
only
people
that
really
burdened
the
courts
were
alyeska.
they
were
the
ones
who
insisted
on
litigating
this
all
the
way
through
right
up
to
this
court.
this
court
i
may
note
denied
certiorari
the
first
time
around
four
days
after
receiving
our
opposition.
and
yet
the
litigation
was
long
and
prolonged
because
of
alyeska's
decision,
not
ours.
and
the
real
issue
here
is
who
should
bear
the
economic
burden
of
compelling
alyeska
and
the
trans-alaska
pipeline
system
to
comply
with
the
law.
and
the
question
really
is
one
between
alyeska
and
exxon
and
arco
and
amerada
hess
on
one
side
and
the
wilderness
society
and
the
environmental
defense
fund
and
the
friends
of
the
earth.
and
who
between
those
two
should
be
compelled
to
their
at
least
part
of
the
economic
burden
of
this
litigation.
in
our
position,
yes
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
that's
correct
your
honor.
i
think
if
the
secretary
had
acted,
as
he
should
have
back
in
1970,
the
litigation
would
have
been
over.
i
think
and
certainly
if
alyeska
had
acted
correctly
and
listened
to
the
preliminary
injunction,
the
litigation
would
have
been
over.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
well,
he
was
the
only
party
before
the
court
and
needless
to
say
we
were
not
anxious
to
invite
mr.
jordan
and
his
law
firm
and
the
oil
companies
into
the
lawsuit
but
we
knew
they
would
come
when
push
came
to
shove.
but
certainly,
the
secretary
in
the
time
that
the
preliminary
injunction
was
in
effect,
at
anytime
could
have
gone
to
congress.
and
mr.
jordan,
his
clients
could
have
also.
they
were
not
prohibited
in
anyway.
in
fact
i
think
the
clear
purport
of
the
statutory
scheme
was
for
mr.
jordan
and
his
client
to
go
to
congress.
we
don't
really
think
that
the
question
of
technical
legal
liability
is
a
sine
qua
non
fully
award
in
this
case.
and
it
certainly
was
not
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
proceeded
and
we
think
correctly
so.
but
even
on
that
point,
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920
has
a
clear
forfeiture
provision
which
in
a
very
real
sense
put
a
direct
legal
liability
on
mr.
jordan
and
his
clients.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
yes.
your
honor
yes.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
yes,
i
think
a
substantial
part
--
the
last
item
in
the
joint
appendix
is
the
actual
bill
of
cost
that
was
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeal
together
with
an
affidavit
for
me
which
explained
various
segments
of
the
work
and
what
the
various
elements
related
to.
i
think
even
here
though
it
is
important
to
focus
on
something.
mr.
jordan
indicates
that
the
nepa
issues
insofar
as
they
were
litigated
really
were
irrelevant
that
we
didn't
prevail
--
admittedly
we
didn't
prevail
because
we
prevailed
on
a
threshold
question.
but
again
the
wilderness
society
and
the
groups
i
represented,
when
the
secretary
announced
in
may
of
1972
that
he
was
going
to
go
ahead
and
issue
permits
not
withstanding
the
preliminary
injunction
and
not
withstanding
the
limitation
of
the
mineral
leasing
act,
we
immediately
filed
a
motion
for
partial
summary
judgment
solely
under
mineral
leasing
act
ground
which
was
the
earliest
time
we
could
do
it.
we
said,
“we
believe
this
is
dispositive
of
this
case.
we
request
the
court
to
rule
on
it
promptly
that
alyeska
and
the
government
had
three
years
now
to
figure
out
why
50
feet
doesn't
mean
50
feet.
and
we
are
satisfied
to
go
on
that
issue
alone.
alyeska,
which
by
this
time
had
intervened
and
as
mr.
jordan
has
indicated
very
vigorously
intervened
have
filed
a
motion
the
next
day
and
argued,
“no!
don't
do
that.
require
the
wilderness
society,
environmental
defense
fund
to
litigate
all
the
issues.
require
them
to
litigate
the
nepa
issues
as
well.”
and
specifically
mr.
jordan
said,
not
the
government,
not
the
state
of
alaska
but
mr.
jordan
and
his
papers
that
unless
the
nepa
issues
are
briefed
and
argued,
the
court
will
not
have
a
basis
for
determining
even
the
mineral
leasing
act
issues,
that
you
cannot
determine
the
mineral
leasing
act
issues
in
the
abstract,
you
need
to
get
the
whole
technical
background
and
development
of
this
entire
case.
and
he
submitted,
“when
you
have
that
and
when
you
tell
the
wilderness
society
to
submit
a
nepa
brief,
we
are
then
convinced
that
you
will
rule
out
their
arguments
on
the
mineral
leasing
act.
and
so
even
on
that
issue,
we
were
told
to
litigate
at
mr.
jordan's
insistence.
now,
mr.
jordan
says
that
we
did
not
prevail
on
the
nepa
issues.
we
didn't
prevail
under
nepa
issues
for
precisely
the
reason
that
we
have
suggested
to
the
court
that
if
the
mineral
leasing
act
were
indeed
a
threshold
bar,
the
court
would
be
in
a
sense
giving
an
abstract
opinion
on
an
issue
of
no
significance
because
congress
would
have
the
final
determination
and
that's
what
ultimately
happened.
i
might
say
that
there
are
questions
raised
frequently
about
delays
and
whether
the
environmentalist
caused
delays
in
the
alaska
pipeline.
but
the
record
indicates
that
the
environmentalists
are
responsible
for
none
or
hardly
any
delay
that
the
initial
suit
was
filed
in
the
beginning
of
1970,
the
earliest
possible
time.
the
oil
companies
and
the
secretary
will
put
on
notice
that
both
the
mineral
leasing
act
and
nepa
impose
some
fairly
serious
obligations
on
them
that
they
ought
to
adhere
to
before
going
ahead
with
this
project.
mr.
jordan
skips
from
1970
to
1972
but
there
was
a
significant
series
of
events
that
occurred
in
early
1971
when
the
interior
department
published
a
draft
impact
statement.
in
january
of
1971,
the
thought
there
was
that
that
would
serve
as
a
basis
to
go
ahead
on
the
project.
and
that
there
might
be
some
fixing
up
of
the
statement
as
a
result
of
comments
but
by
march
or
so
of
1971,
there'd
be
a
go
ahead.
that
statement
was
given
by
the
interior
department
to
mr.
jordan's
clients
prior
to
its
publication.
many
of
the
comments
about
the
impact
of
the
trans-alaska
pipeline
system
were
softened.
there
was
tremendous
criticism
of
that
impact
statement
as
a
result
by
our
organizations,
by
other
federal
government
agencies.
and
as
a
result,
it
was
not
really
until
february
of
1971
that
the
interior
department
and
i
submit
mr.
jordan's
clients
got
down
to
the
serious
business
of
grappling
with
the
real
complexities
of
this
project.
so,
really
a
whole
year
was
lost
from
march
of
1970
to
around
february
of
1971.
and
it's
a
year
for
which
these
respondents
are
in
no
way
responsible.
and
then
from
1971
as
i
indicated
till
1972,
there
was
the
work
being
done
on
the
environmental
impact
statement.
we
don't
claim
that
credit
for
the
good
things
that
came
and
there
are
a
lot
of
good
things
that
came
through
that
effort.
in
the
course
of
this
litigation,
we'd
oppose
the
individual
who
was
placed
in
charge
of
the
drafting
effort
by
the
secretary
of
interior,
a
geologist
named
dr.
david
brew
and
i
have
never
found
a
medic,
find
a
public
servant
and
a
more
dedicated
man
in
my
life.
and
he
received
accolades
from
us
as
well
as
well
as
from
mr.
jordan's
clients.
we
had
some
problems
with
the
work
that
was
completed
but
there
couldn't
have
been
a
man
who
worked
harder
or
who
had
the
public
interest
more
at
heart.
but
then
when
that
impact
statement
was
issued
as
i
have
indicated
while
we
presented
our
views
to
the
secretary
about
what
we
thought
still
was
wrong
with
it,
we
were
perfectly
willing
for
the
litigation
to
end
at
that
point,
if
a
congress
to
do
its
job.
we
submitted
the
papers
but
the
oil
companies
wanted
to
keep
the
case
in
the
courts.
ultimately,
we
prevailed
under
mineral
leasing
act
issue
and
mr.
jordan
says
in
his
brief
and
says
today
but
it
was
on
a
technical
issue
that
was
of
no
importance.
what
difference
this
50
feet
mean?
well
i
think
the
subsequent
history
of
anything
demonstrates
what
the
importance
of
it
was,
congress
didn't
say
“my
god
50
feet
is
absurd,
we
don't
care,
take
a
hundred,
take
a
thousand,
just
build
this
thing
and
get
the
oil
down”.
there
are
10
months
of
debate
and
with
all
of
the
pressures
that
were
replaced
and
realistic
ones.
all
of
the
knowledge
of
the
impending
energy
problems,
the
decision
to
build
the
trans-alaska
pipeline
without
further
litigation
passed
by
the
senate
by
a
49-49
vote
with
vice
president
agnew
breaking
the
time.
and
it
passed
in
the
house
by
a
vote
of
221
to
198
and
even
then
the
proponents
of
that
legislation,
it
certainly
was
unusual
legislation.
but
even
then
they
said
that
the
delays
that
have
already
occurred
as
a
result
of
this
litigation
which
permitted
the
interior
department
and
alyeska
finally
to
get
down
to
work
and
do
what
they
should
have
down
all
along,
convinces
us
that
now
we
can
go
ahead.
so
i
don't
take
the
subsequent
legislation
that
came
out
of
the
congress
as
a
defeat
for
the
environmental
groups
that
is
precisely
what
they
had
been
asking
for
all
along.
they
had
been
asking
that
there
be
a
real
and
considered
judgment
of
what
the
implications
of
this
project
were
and
we
got
that.
and
they
were
asking
that
the
matter
be
referred
to
congress,
as
congress
has
indicated
it
wished
in
the
mineral
leasing
act
of
1920,
we
got
that.
and
there's
been
no
further
dispute.
the
pipeline
is
being
built.
we
wish
the
oil
companies
well
and
we
do
hope
that
it
will
be
done
in
an
environmentally
responsible
manner
and
presumed
that
it
will.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
well,
the
one
that
was
originally
proposed
was
a
--
really
was
hard
to
say
whether
anything
was
originally
proposed.
what
the
oil
companies
essentially
went
into
the
interior
department
with,
was
a
map
and
a
line
of
where
they
plan
to
go
and
essentially
what
they
said
was
that
“we'll
get
out
in
the
field
and
out
in
the
field
we
will
be
able
to
make
adjustments.”
but
the
principle
differences
were
number
one,
that
all
of
the
river
crossings
were
to
be
buried
and
that
would
have
had
tremendous
erosion
problems
and
there
would
have
been
significant
ruptures
along
the
line.
all
of
the
overland
portion
with
the
exception
about
5%
was
too
be
buried
and
now
it
was
more
--
was
to
be
buried,
now
about
55%
or
so
will
be
elevated.
there
was
very
little
understanding
of
the
topography
along
the
root
of
potential
landslides
and
avalanches.
and
of
course
the
most
significant
problem
and
one
that
by
the
way
remains
a
problems
one
that
concerns
everyone
still
greatly
including,
i'm
sure
the
oil
companies
is
that
the
southern
two
thirds
of
the
alaska
pipeline
route
is
seismically
about
the
most
active
area
in
the
world.
in
fact
the
southern
terminus,
valdez,
was
destroyed
in
1964
by
a
major
earthquake.
the
interior
department's
impact
statement
indicates
that
there
will
be
a
major
earthquake
along
the
pipeline
route
sometime
during
its
life.
now
the
time
that
has
gone
by
has
at
least
permitted
alyeska
to
prepare
contingency
plans
and
certain
defenses
in
areas
where
they
know
there
are
potentially
active
faults.
the
most
obvious
one
is
it
(inaudible)
which
everyone
has
been
aware
of
for
a
while.
the
frightening
thing
though
is
that
the
interior
department
statement
indicates
that
there
maybe
other
potentially
seismic
active
falls
all
along
the
route
that
cannot
be
predicted.
so
we
maybe
and
for
some
very
serious
problems
in
the
years
ahead,
if
one
of
those
should
become
active
and
by
the
way
even
with
all
the
study,
the
conclusion
is
that
if
there
is
a
major
rupture,
there
will
be
a
minimum
of
about
60,000
barrels
of
oil
that
will
spill
into
the
lakes
and
the
streams
before
preventive
measures
can
be
taken.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
yes,
as
i
said
your
honor,
i
think
there
have
been
certainly
with
respect
to
(inaudible)
and
other
areas
that
have
been
protections
that
have
been
built
in,
there
also
was
a
--
i
think
a
much
greater
knowledge
of
the
permafrost
problems
of
the
problems
with
vegetations
of
how
to
restore
vegetation
which
is
important
not
only
for
the
environment
but
also
for
the
integrity
of
the
pipeline
because
these
pressures
could
be
just
enormous,
if
you
start
interfering
with
the
permafrost,
you
have
the
melting
going
one
way
and
sort
of
coming
back
against
the
pipeline.
and
it's
still
an
amazingly
complex
project
and
one
that
is
going
to
take
all
of
the
efforts
of
mr.
jordan's
clients
to
cope
with
and
we
sincerely
hope
that
we'll
be
able
to
do
it.
i
think
another
problem
which
i
might
mention
is
the
--
well
it's
called
the
trans-alaska
pipeline
and
that
certainly
is
what
it
is.
once
it
makes
it
through,
if
i
could
just
have
a
minute,
ones
the
pipeline
makes
it
through
the
entire
root,
the
problems
really
only
begin
because
then
it
has
to
be
loaded
on
to
these
major
super
tankers.
and
again
the
final
impact
statement
says
that
--
and
this
is
now
when
all
the
study
is
over.
that
in
the
average
of
the
pipeline,
we
can
expect
a
140
barrels
of
oil
to
pollute
the
northeast
pacific
which
is
the
vast
but
really
major
unpolluted
ocean
area
in
the
world.
and
that's
only
an
average
figure,
one
super
tanker
crash
will
spill
a
million
barrels.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
the
petitioner
does
not
in
its
brief
and
does
not
seriously
here
today
question
the
power
of
the
court
below
to
make
the
award
of
fees
in
this
case.
nor,
does
it
really
seem
to
be
arguing
that
the
factors
cited
by
the
court
as
applied
to
this
case
do
not
justify
or
do
not
support
the
award
of
fees.
and
what
really
appears
to
be
the
principal
argument,
it
certainly
seems
to
true
in
the
brief
and
i
think
it
was
the
thrust
of
the
argument
today,
was
that
somehow,
this
decision
to
award
fees
in
this
case
is
allowed
to
stand,
the
lower
courts
will
be
set
off
in
all
sorts
of
directions
issuing
all
sorts
of
unpredictable
opinions
awarding
fees.
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
lower
courts
are
entitled
to
a
little
more
confidence
than
that.
indeed
a
hundred
years
ago
when
this
court
first
extended
and
recognized
the
validity
of
an
awarded
fees
in
the
common
fund
cases
in
the
trustees
v.
greenough,
that
very
argument
was
made
that
if
you
permit
lower
courts
were
familiar
with
the
particular
facts
of
a
particular
case
to
decide,
that
fees
should
be
awarded.
we
will
be
set
off
in
a
parade
of
horrors.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
mr.
chief
justice,
what
the
court
really
looked
to
was
--
it
was
a
traditional
english
practice
and
most
of
the
cases
cited
with
a
traditional
equity
powers
of
the
english
court.
and
i
submit
that
that
same
equity
power
as
exercised
is
really
the
same
power
that
was
exercised
by
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
we'll
if
he
did,
he
is
certainly
in
error
and
i
didn't
understand
him
to
say
that.
in
fact
i
think
he
conceded
that
there
--
and
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
this
court
has
not
directly
passed
on
the
private
attorney
general
theory
as
such
but
certainly
there
is
extensive
precedent
in
the
lower
federal
court.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
and
i
certainly
i
agree
with
that
also
your
honor
and
just
is
greenough,
there
was
no
precedent
in
this
court
for
recognizing
an
award
of
fee
in
context
of
the
common
fund.
but
i
think
that
the
same
considerations
really
that
gave
rise
to
the
award
in
greenough
apply
here.
really
what
the
court
was
saying,
is
it
fair
in
a
circumstance
as
such
as
that
when
one
individual
has
really
had
to
take
the
burden
of
a
litigation
that
goes
far
beyond
any
interest
of
his
own.
is
it
fair
for
that
individual
to
bear
the
full
burden
of
the
litigation
when
there
is
an
equitable
mechanism
available
for
spreading
the
cost.
and
i
believe
that's
exactly
the
same
factor
that
the
court
of
appeals
below
recognized
in
this
situation.
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
and
i
think
the
record
here
demonstrates
amply
that
this
is
a
unique
case,
this
is
a
truly
extraordinary
case.
the
issues
were
extremely
complex,
the
litigating
burden
that
the
respondents
for
no
economic
benefits
had
to
assume
was
immense.
and
that
the
results
of
the
litigation
were
beneficial.
and
they
were
not
a
benefit
that
in
anyway
adhere
to
the
economic
gain
of
the
respondents.
now
a
hundred
years
ago,
much
the
same
argument
that
mr.
jordan
has
made
today
was
made
and
this
is
what
justice
bradley
said.
a
just
respect
for
the
eminent
judges
under
whose
direction,
many
of
these
cases
have
been
administered
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
allowances
of
this
kind
if
made
with
moderation
and
a
jealous
regard
to
the
rights
of
those
who
are
interested
are
not
only
admissible
but
agreeable
to
the
principles
of
equity
and
justice.
and
i
submit
that
that
is
precisely
what
happened
in
this
case
and
that
the
court
with
the
greatest
familiarity
of
this
record
and
the
court
which
struggled
with
this
case
over
period
of
five
months
in
reaching
that
the
decision
in
wilderness
society
want
was
it
correct
in
ruling
that
this
wasn't
appropriate
case
for
an
award
of
fees.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
there
is
of
course
traditional
powers
under
the
observed
behavior
standard
and
also
for
a
misuse
of
court
process
as
courts
have
always
had
this
power
to
punish
and
it
really
is
a
power
to
punish
for
frivolous
litigation.
i
would
say
to
the
extent
that
that
sort
of
litigation
was
not
frivolous
but
was
not
in
the
end,
proven
to
be
meritorious.
the
traditional
principles
of
the
american
rule,
nothing
else
outstanding
would
probably
dictate
that
each
party
bear
its
own
fees.
and
i
think
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
said
was
that
the
very
principles
that
stand
behind
the
american
rule
which
is
that
they
aren't
to
be
barriers
toward
litigating
meritorious
interest
would
permit
an
award
of
fees
in
this
case
who
would
not
necessarily
require
and
really
shouldn't
the
wholesale
abandonment
of
the
american
rule
and
every
other
context.
and
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
here
mr.
chief
justice
is
a
truly
exceptional
case.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
court
said
“was
look
at
this
individuals
who
had
no
economic
gain
at
all
and
look
at
the
position
they
were
in
that
they
had
to
step
into
the
breach
to
get
the
law
enforced
for
no
economic
interest
at
all.”
that
combined
with
the
other
factors
cited
by
the
court,
led
it
to
the
conclusion
that
if
there
was
an
equitable
way
of
shifting
some
of
that
cost,
it
could
do
so.
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
point,
it
looked
to
see
who
that
cost
could
be
shifted
to.
it
determined
that
alyeska
for
many
of
the
factors,
i
have
discussed
this
morning
was
certainly
a
responsible
party
in
the
litigation
who
really
was
responsible
for
many
of
the
issues
that
were
raised
in
the
litigation
was
very
active.
and
then
the
last
thing
the
court
looked
to
was,
now
if
we
do
in
light
of
those
factors
shift
fees
from
the
respondents
to
the
petitioner,
is
there
anyway
that
the
shifting
of
fees
could
act
as
a
deterrent
to
alyeska
or
anyone
else
similarly
situated
to
litigate
its
interest
in
court
and
the
court
said
“no.”
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
well,
i
think
here
you're
talking
about
really
a
different
interest.
you're
not
talking
about
a
very
different
purpose
of
an
award.
here
you're
saying
that
if
you
have
litigation
where
one
party
wins
and
one
party
loses
should
the
party
that
wins
be
awarded
fees
and
i
think
the
answer
on
the
traditional
american
rule
was
“no.”
and
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
very
limited
exception
where
you
do
have,
when
the
case
is
over
the
party
which
had
to
intervene
simply
because
the
law
was
not
being
upheld
for
anyone
else.
should
that
party
as
in
this
case
compared
with
alyeska
be
forced
to
bear
that
burden
and
i
think
the
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
the
fee
that
is
awarded
to
me
will
go
to
the
center
for
loan
social
policy
which
is
the
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
oh
i'm
sorry,
the
client
applied
for
the
fees.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
well
i
presume,
in
most
of
these
attorney's
fees
cases
and
this
is
certainly
the
way
the
nacp
legal
defense
and
educational
fund
case
has
worked.
the
fee
is
either
made
out
to
the
client
itself
but
the
court
indicating
that
the
fee
is
to
go
the
lawyers
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
no
obligation
to
pay
a
fee.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
no
he
would
pass
it
on
to
the
organization
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
the
center
for
law
and
social
policy
would
keep
the
fee,
i
will
not
get
a
penny
for
it.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
not
at
all
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
no,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
no,
your
honor
that's
principal
founder
is
the
ford
foundation.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
yes.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
the
internal
revenue
services
have
been
presented
with
the
question
and
has
ruled
that
awards
of
fees
to
that
would
go
to
groups
such
as
a
center
for
law
and
social
policy
are
appropriate
and
it
doesn't
affect
the
basic
charitable
nature
of
the
organization.
and
of
course
as
i
indicated
the
individual
lawyers
will
not
be
properly
prompt.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
well
i
think
that
the
standard
and
certainly
this
is
the
standard
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
a
reached
in
a
number
of
civil
rights
cases
going
over
the
years
is
that
the
appropriate
standard
should
be
the
value
of
the
legal
services
taking
in
a
lot
of
other
considerations.
and
in
a
situation
such
as
this,
if
lawyers
are
willing
to
take
on
these
cases
for
less
remuneration
and
certainly
that
the
remuneration,
i
received
would
be
a
very
small
portion
of
what
mr.
jordan
would
receive
for
arguing
the
opposite
side
of
the
case,
that
that
should
not
be
the
standard
really,
that
would
determine
the
award
because
otherwise
it
could
really
be
the
poorer
the
group
and
the
more
sacrificial
the
lawyer,
the
less
the
award
would
be
and
i
think
would
present
very,
very
difficult
problem
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
yes.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
but
what
we're
talking
about
here
i
think
a
real
economic
burden
and
the
question
is
if
you
have
lawyers
who
are
talking
on
this
case
as
i
did
here
for
substantially
less
than
what
they
would
make
and
certainly
as
a
father
of
5,
i
can
say
it
was
substantially
less.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
well
i
think
what
the
courts
are
trying
to
is
get
away
from
the
subjective
factors
by
simply
valuing
the
legal
service
and
not
getting
into
this
question
about
just
how
much
the
salary
was
paid
and
how
much
the
secretaries
were
paid.
and
how
much
the
typewriters
cost
and
how
much
it
costed
to
heat
the
room
where
we
had
to
answer
the
200
page
brief.
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
oh
i
think
it
seriously
does,
there's
no
question
that
this
litigation
was
one
that
that
was
one
that
the
groups
himself
had
to
think
very
seriously
about
knowing
what
they
were
getting
into
and
i
can
certainly
say
from
a
personal
nature
that
i
certainly
had
to
think
very
seriously
about
it
whether
i
was
willing
to
take
it
on
under
the
conditions
that
i
knew
i'd
be
working
on
and
knowing
that
the
nature
and
this
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
yes
that's
right.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
well
the
money
is
going
to
help
because
at
least
it
will
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
that's
essentially
right
but
i
think
it
also
permits
the
organization
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
i
don't
think
it
does
but
i
think
the
fee
in
this
case
which
i
think
is
based
on
this
case
alone
is
one
that
really
talks
about
a
real
economic
burden
either
that
a
lawyer
gave
up
or
didn't
but
we're
talking
about
you
know
the
actual
facts.
i
think
that
insofar
as
what's
going
to
be
done
with
the
money,
it
certainly
would
be
possible
for
the
lawyers
and
for
the
group
simply
to
say
that
the
lawyers
would
receive
whatever
extra
money
they
would
get
when
they
won
the
case
and
therefore
would
be
made
hold.
it
just
happens
that
lawyers
with
the
senate
as
lawyers
with
nacp
legal
defense
and
educational
funds
have
agreed
that
they
will
not
take
the
extra
money.
but
i
really
don't
see
why
that
should
be
the
distinction
as
to
what
the
actual
award
should
be.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
i
do,
i
--
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
either
way
the
organization
will
get
as
much
as
i
can
give
it
and
i
won't
take
anything.
mr.
dennis
j.
flannery
no
but
i
think
the
government
is
the
attorney
general
and
i
think
that
it's
generally
understood
that
the
when
the
government
brings
litigation
of
course,
and
we're
talking
about
really
a
solid
base,
their
taxes
which
are
going
to
support
the
government
lawyers,
their
pension
funds,
there's
a
hospitalization,
there's
retirement
of
a
very
different
situation
for
a
lawyer
even
though
obviously
lawyers
and
career
lawyers
are
making
sacrifices.
there
are
very
different
situation
from
a
private
lawyer
who
was
really
moving
into
the
place
of
the
government
for
one
reason
or
another
who
was
then
shouldering
the
burden
and
i
think
that
this
is
--
this
decision
in
this
particular
case
is
designed
to
lighten
effort.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
