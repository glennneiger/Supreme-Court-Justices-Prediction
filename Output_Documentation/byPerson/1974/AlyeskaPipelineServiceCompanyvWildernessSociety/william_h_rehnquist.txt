did
they
seek
fees
just
for
their
services
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
for
throughout
the
litigation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
jordan
how
can
a
court
possibly
decide
whether
or
not
that
was
or
was
not
an
important
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
if
a
width
statute
were
passed
today
with
the
environmental
concerns
that
are
apparent,
i
suppose
one
might
say
that
it
was
thought
to
be
very
important
that
the
secretary
grant
just
so
much
right
of
way
and
no
more.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
sat
here
during
the
argument
of
this
last
case,
we
have
a
hell
of
a
time
figuring
out
what
congress
meant
substantively
in
the
statute
to
--
that
we
should
go
further
and
decide
whether
or
not
congress
thought
it
was
important.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
the
civil
rights
act
of
â€˜64
authorizes
counsel
fee.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
it
just
boils
down
to
the
deeper
pocket
under
your
analysis
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
the
procedural
history
here
had
been
almost
exactly
the
opposite
where
it
had
been
determined
that
your
client
had
been
wrong
at
every
juncture
and
then
alyeska
comes
in
and
asks
for
attorney's
fees
at
the
close
of
the
situation.
now
i
take
it,
your
client
probably
isn't
insolvent,
would
your
client's
resources
be
tested
by
the
same
standards
as
alyeska's
were
in
determining
whether
or
not
fees
could
be
awarded?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
rationale
is
to
not
to
deter
litigation,
i
would
think
that
the
answer
you
just
gave
to
the
chief
justice
does
not
really
support
your
proposition.
it
may
seem
or
perhaps
a
harsh
result
but
if
in
fact
lawyers
are
willing
to
bring
these
kinds
of
lawsuits
for
less
than
the
going
rate,
the
fact
that
they
don't
receive
ordinary
counsel
fees
apparently
will
not
deter
them.
