the
court

and
if
it's
awarded
and
the
check
is
made
out,
to
whom
will
it
be
made
out.
justice

is
this
the
client
under
any
obligation
to
you
to
pay
a
fee?
justice
byron

and
so
that
the
client
keeps
the
fee
doesn't
pass
it
on
to
you.

in
the
alyeska
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
held
that
if
--
that
the
appellees
--
or
respondents,
wilderness
society
and
others
were
entitled
to
attorney's
fees
for
at
least
partially
prevailing
in
an
action
which
they
brought
charging
that
the
award
of
a
right
of
way
for
a
pipeline
was
invalid
under
the
relevant
federal
statutes
providing
for
rights
of
way
and
under
the
environmental
protection
act.
neither
act
provides
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fee
but
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
courts
had
the
authority
to
award
fees
since
they
had
in
the
court's
view
acted
as
private
attorneys
general
in
enforcing
important
federal
statutes.
we
reverse.
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
in
context
such
as
these
is
a
matter
for
congress
and
not
for
the
courts
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
authority
to
order
otherwise.
the
judgment
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
as
had
mr.
justice
marshall.
justices
douglas
and
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
