mr.
randolph,
at
that
point,
does
your
office
does
have
any
knowledge
of
why
they
chose
that
route
rather
than
an
original
action
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
mr.
randolph
again?

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
cranston,
i
want
to
be
sure,
has
alaska
now
abandoned
its
claim
that
sovereignty
at
one
time
was
exercised
by
the
russians?
you
no
longer
rely
on
this?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now
on
the
japanese
situation,
you're
taking
the
position,
i
take
it
that
the
absence
of
japanese
shipping
in
cook
inlet
equates
with
a
positive
acquiescence
in
the
claim
of
sovereignty.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
have
any
other
instance
of
any
other
foreign
nation's
acquiescence?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
lower
portion
of
the
various
substantial
body
of
water
known
as
“cook
inlet”
on
the
southern
coast
of
the
state
of
alaska
constitutes
the
high
seas
or
what
is
known
as
a
“historic
bay”
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state.
in
more
practical
terms,
the
issue
is
whether
the
state
of
alaska
on
the
one
hand
or
the
united
states
on
the
other
presently
has
the
right
to
offer
acres
of
land
submerged
in
the
lower
inlet
for
oil
and
gas
leases.
in
1967,
alaska
offered
some
acreage
for
this
purpose.
the
united
states
contending
that
the
lower
inlet
constituted
the
high
seas
brought
suit
to
quiet
title
in
federal
court
in
the
district
of
alaska.
the
state
defended
on
the
ground
that
the
inlet
was
a
historic
bay
and
thus
was
subject
to
state
sovereignty.
alaska
prevailed
in
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
we
granted
certiorari
because
of
the
importance
of
the
litigation.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
the
proof
was
insufficient
to
establish
lower
cook
inlet
as
a
historic
bay.
we
review
in
turn
the
evidence
of
sovereignty
exercise
during
the
russian
period,
the
territorial
period
prior
to
the
time
alaska
became
a
state
and
the
period
since
statehood.
we
conclude
that
neither
russia's
exercise
of
authority
nor
our
federal
government's
enforcement
of
fishing
and
wild
life
regulations
or
alaska's
enforcement
of
fishing
regulations
was
sufficient
for
this
purpose.
and
we
review
in
particular,
the
factor
of
acquiescence
by
foreign
nations
and
also
the
significance
of
alaska's
arrest
of
two
japanese
fishing
vessels
in
the
shelikof
strait
in
1962
and
the
japanese
reaction
to
that
incident.
i'm
authorized
to
say
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
filed
a
joint
statement
to
the
effect
that
in
their
view,
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court
and
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
were
not
clearly
erroneous
and
therefore,
they
would
affirm
the
judgment.
mr.
justice
douglas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
