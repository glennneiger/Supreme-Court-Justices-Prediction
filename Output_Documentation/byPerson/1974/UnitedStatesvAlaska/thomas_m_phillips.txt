mr.
thomas
m.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
short
time
that
i
presume
to
take
this
morning,
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
or
invite
the
court's
attention
to
two
points,
two
issues.
the
first
issue
maybe
fairly
stated
i
think
in
this
inquiry
has
there
been
an
expressed
or
explicit
claim
of
jurisdiction
over
cook
inlet.
if
so,
and
alaska
claims
it
is
so,
then
the
two
following
elements
we
think
fall
easily
into
patent,
the
continuity
of
the
assertion,
the
acquiescence
of
foreign
nations.
in
1924,
congress
enacted
what
is
popularly
known
as
the
white
act.
the
purpose
of
the
white
act
was
to
protect
the
fisheries
of
alaska.
the
act
authorized
the
secretary
of
commerce.
in
subsequent
years,
the
secretary
of
interior,
and
i
quote,
“to
set
a
part
and
reserve
fishing
areas
in
any
of
the
waters
over
which
the
united
states
has
jurisdiction.”
these
are
the
key
words,
“any
of
the
waters
over
which
the
united
states
has
jurisdiction.”
these
words
set
the
stage.
for
what
thereafter,
the
executive
department
of
the
government
was
to
do
was
it
to
set
apart
cook
inlet
as
waters
over
which
the
united
states
claimed
jurisdiction.
was
it
to
set
aside
only
a
part
of
the
waters,
for
example
three
miles
from
the
coastlines?
what
did
the
department,
the
executive
branch
do?
it
set
apart
12
fishing
areas,
geographically
by
name,
by
definition.
in
the
11
of
those
12
areas,
the
secretary
was
careful
to
limit
jurisdiction
claimed
by
the
use
of
the
words
territorial,
coastal
waters.
it
might
be
helpful
to
the
court
to
look
at
just
how
this
was
done,
page
1171
of
volume
2
of
the
appendix.
look
at
the
definition
for
example.
i'm
selecting
this
at
random,
of
bristol
bay.
the
bristol
bay
area
is
hereby
defined
to
include
all
territorial,
coastal
and
tributary
waters
of
alaska
from
cape
newenham,
etcetera.
look
at
the
definition
of
the
kodiak
area.
the
kodiak
area
is
hereby
defined
as
to
include
the
waters
of
the
mainland
shore
extending
and
so
on
and
the
territorial
coastal
and
tributurial
waters
of
alaska.
now,
traditionally,
the
solicitor
has
argued
this,
both
here
this
morning
and
in
his
brief
and
we
don't
dispute
it.
the
united
states
sets
it's
delimited
its
claim
of
territorial
sea
to
the
breadth
of
three
miles
and
what
then
is
the
significance
of
the
use
of
this
language
territorial
coastal
waters.
secretary
of
interior,
udall,
in
a
letter
dated
april
20,
1962
to
the
secretary
of
state
explained
the
significance
of
these
words
and
he
said
that
the
use
of
the
territorial
coastal
waters
indicated
an
intent
to
limit
the
claim
of
sovereignty
in
those
districts
to
three
miles.
we
may
agree
that's
in
line
with
this
traditional
assertion
of
three
miles
for
territorial
sea.
i
have
said,
this
was
done
in
11
of
the
districts.
look
at
the
definition
of
cook
inlet,
the
12,
page
1171,
definition
cook
inlet
area.
the
cook
inlet
area
is
hereby
defined
to
include
cook
inlet
is
tributary
waters
an
all
adjoining
waters,
north
of
cape
douglas
and
west
of
point
gore,
the
barren
islands
are
included
within
this
area.
notice
the
absence
of
the
words
territorial
coastal
waters.
in
talking
about
territorial
coastal
waters,
secretary
udall
and
probably
so
said
the
use
of
that
islands
and
no
i'm
quoting,
“negates
any
assertion
of
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
waters.”
but
what
about
cook
inlet?
we
suggest
and
the
government
has
never
answered
this
argument
that
if
today,
the
federal
government
was
the
author
of
that
definition,
was
given
the
chore
of
asserting
jurisdiction
overall
of
cook
inlet,
he
could
not
have
chosen
clearer
or
more
precise
words,
are
more
encompassing
words
than
the
words
“all
of
the
waters.”
mr.
thomas
m.
phillips
this
--
this
mr.
justice
brennan
is
the
regulations
put
out
each
year
for
33
years
by
first
the
department
of
commerce,
secretary
of
commerce
and
later
years,
the
secretary
of
interior,
defining
as
the
act
required
him
to
do
to
set
apart
certain
areas.
in
the
lower
court,
the
government's
chief
witness
was
a
man
named
howard
balso
who
had
testified
that
he
have
some
experience
and
expertise
in
drafting
these
definitions.
we've
asked
him
if
he
could
draft
one
so
far
as
cook
inlet
was
concerned
that
could
use
words
that
would
more
clearly
assert
jurisdiction
than
the
language
i've
read
to
you
and
of
course
he
said
he
could
not.
now
why,
the
court
may
ask
was
cook
inlet
singled
out.
it's
not
an
accident
because
it
was
done
year
after
year,
after
year
for
33
years,
from
1924
to
1957.
why?
there
are
three
reasons
and
they're
undisputed.
first,
there
was
judicial
precedent
for
this.
in
1892,
a
federal
district
court
sitting
in
alaska
had
held
that
no
part
of
the
waters
of
cook
inlet
were
international
waters.
secondly,
as
a
reason,
cook
inlet
unlike
any
other
of
the
submerged
lands
cases
that
this
court
has
said
and
considered
though
it
be
enlarged
body
of
water,
is
uniquely
surrounded
by
the
lands
of
alaska.
if
the
court
please,
here
as
i
point,
is
cook
inlet.
we
look
at
the
whole
map
of
alaska
as
we
take
it
here.
you
see
this
area
that
i
am
pointing
to,
cook
inlet,
almost
surrounded
by
the
lands
of
alaska
and
this
geographic
fact
undisputed
was
of
significance
to
the
district
court
in
the
kodiak
decision
in
1892
and
it
is
dealt
with
that
length
by
the
lower
court
in
this
case.
a
third
reason
why
cook
inlet
was
singled
out,
the
evidence
is
undisputed
and
the
lower
court
found
in
these
findings
of
fact
that
from
the
very
beginning.
all
of
the
waters
of
cook
inlet
have
been
vital
to
the
interest
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
shores
of
cook
inlet.
mr.
thomas
m.
phillips
well,
i
noticed,
you're
looking
page
831
of
the
record
and
that's
the
letter
of
april
20
--
mr.
thomas
m.
phillips
yes,
sir.
now,
in
the
first
place,
you'll
notice
that
he's
not
talking
about
cook
inlet
and
he's
stressing
as
i
pointed
out
a
moment
ago
the
use
of
the
words
territorial
coastal
waters.
now,
if
it's
fair
for
him
to
say
these
words
limit
jurisdiction
and
it
is
fair
for
him
to
say
that.
it's
fair
for
us
to
say
when
those
words
are
not
put
in
the
definition
of
cook
inlet
but
the
words
are
“all
the
waters”,
then
i
think
secretary
udall's
reasoning
enforces
the
claim,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
alaska
makes
here.
at
least
that's
our
argument.
that
has
been
our
contention.
mr.
thomas
m.
phillips
enforced
in
this
sense
and
we
claim
this
is
enforcement
that
there
were
--
it
was
distributed
throughout
the
world.
it
was
the
basis
upon
which
repeated
arrests
had
been
made
of
american
citizens.
the
lower
court
found
that
these
patrollers
were
open
and
notorious
and
that
any
foreign
nation
would
have
been
put
on
notice
of
the
united
states
claim.
mr.
thomas
m.
phillips
sir?
mr.
thomas
m.
phillips
yes,
salmon
was
the
important
fishery.
the
third
reason
that
cook
inlet
was
pointed
--
was
singled
out
was
that
which
the
trial
court
found
and
based
on
undisputed
evidence
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
now,
accepted
by
the
federal
government
is
that
if
this
fishing
had
not
been
controlled
for
the
benefit
of
the
american
people,
those
fishing
areas
would
have
been
destroyed
to
the
economic
disaster
of
out
of
people
of
america
and
the
citizens
and
residents
of
alaska.
one
final
point,
chesapeake
bay
is
a
historic
inland
bay.
it
has
substantially
the
same
words
that
were
seized
upon
by
a
court
that
recognized
chesapeake
bay.
the
language
that
described
a
revenue
district,
chesapeake
bay
overall
the
waters,
shores,
bays,
harbors
and
inlets
comprehended
within
the
line
drawn
from
cape
henry
to
the
mouth
of
the
james
river.
if
it's
logical
that
chesapeake
bay
was
held
to
be
by
this
language,
a
historic
inland
bay
by
the
same
language
is
logical
that
the
trial
court
found
that
cook
inlet
was
a
historic
inland
bay.
let
me
pass
to
the
second
issue
that
i
want
to
talk
about.
the
claim
like
all
out
alaska
has
done
has
been
approved
that
this
is
a
historic
territorial
sea
rather
than
a
historic
inland
bay.
we
say
that
argument
is
wrong
both
legally
and
factually.
first,
the
juridical
regime
--
mr.
thomas
m.
phillips
i'll
be
very
quick,
your
honor.
the
juridical
regime
points
out
that
a
state
which
forbids
foreign
ships
to
fish
therein
undisputedly
demonstrates
by
such
action
as
desired
to
act
as
a
sovereign.
well,
of
course,
where
a
nation's
laws
have
been
so
clearly
stated
as
a
judicial
regime
also
recognizes
the
foreign
nations
can
recognize
those
laws
and
not
come
in
that
event
of
course,
there's
no
occasion
to
enforce
the
law
and
the
findings
bear
on
that.
let
me
legally
address
that
argument
however,
the
argument
that
we've
shown
only
a
territorial
sea.
the
dominant
--
the
juridical
regime
states
that
the
dominant
opinion
is
that
when
you
talk
about
historic
bays,
you
are
talking
about
inland
waters.
the
convention
on
territorial
sea
and
contiguous
zone,
article
7
permits
a
line
to
be
drawn
between
the
entrance
points
of
a
bay
where
the
entrance
points
are
not
farther
than
24
miles
apart.
that
line
encloses
inland
waters.
section
6
accepts
historic
bays
from
that
24-mile
restriction
so
that
if
you
draw
a
line
across
the
entrance
points
on
the
exception
of
historic
bay,
that
line
necessarily
encloses
inland
waters.
i
leave
--
i
trespass
to
the
four
on
that
point.
i
thank
you.
