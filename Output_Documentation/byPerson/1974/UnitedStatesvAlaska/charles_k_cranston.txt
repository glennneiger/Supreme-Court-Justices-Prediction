mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
court
in
the
second
louisiana
case
indicated
that
historic
bay
cases
such
as
these
raised
principally
factual
issues
and
that
since
the
doctrine
of
historic
bays
are
somewhat
imprecise,
it
is
to
the
trier
of
fact
to
which
this
court
leaves
the
initial
determination.
the
--
therefore,
the
evidence
as
to
what
constitutes
a
historic
bay
is
in
alaska's
opinion
extremely
important
and
is
the
point
upon
which
this
case
will
actually
turn.
therefore,
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
the
evidence.
as
this
court
is
aware
and
as
there
is
no
dispute,
there
are
three
criteria
evidentiary
wise
upon
which
a
bay's
status
is
characterized
as
historic,
that
is
to
say,
the
exercise
of
sovereignty
over
a
considerable
period
of
time
with
the
acquiescence
of
foreign
nations.
with
respect
to
sovereignty,
the
striking
fact
of
this
case
is
that
witness
after
witness,
without
objection
by
united
states
incidentally
relative
to
this
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
no
objection
was
made
as
to
the
introduction
of
any
of
this
evidence
in
the
petition.
witness
after
witness
testified
to
continual
patrols,
continual
arrests,
continual
boardings
of
vessels
and
continual
vessel
arrests
from
the
year,
if
we
begin
with
the
kodiak
case,
1892
up
through
1971
and
the
boardings
and
patrols
were
testified
too
by
the
principal
witness
of
the
united
states,
mr.
howard
balso
as
being
a
very
significant
act
of
enforcement
and
what
was
the
enforcement
to
do?
principally,
two
things:one,
witness
after
witness,
uncontradicted
and
the
court
so
found
testified
that
cook
inlet
from
the
line
drawn
by
the
court,
that
is
to
say
point
gore,
barren
islands,
cape
douglas,
was
patrolled
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
the
alien
fishing
act,
an
act
which
specifically
prohibited
aliens
fishing
in
waters
of
alaska
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
the
united
states
would
tend
to
disregard
this
evidence
and
say
that
the
definition
of
waters
of
alaska
was
unclear
in
the
alien
fishing
act.
but
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
the
act
was
passed
only
six
years
after
the
kodiak
decision
of
which
congress
must
have
been
presumably
aware
of
which
defined
all
of
cook
inlet
as
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
not
international
waters.
that
definition
was
incorporated
into
the
alien
fishing
act
and
enforced
by
agents
and
patrol
officers
of
the
united
states.
it
is
important
that
testimony
on
this
point
is
clear
and
uncontradicted
and
the
lower
court
found
this
to
be
so.
secondly,
as
to
continuity,
two
expert
witnesses
called
by
the
state
of
alaska
testified
that
based
upon
their
historic
research
again
uncontradicted
and
found
by
the
lower
court
that
the
usage
or
that
the
activities
by
the
united
states
over
all
of
cook
inlet
were
such
as
to
have
developed
into
a
usage.
this
is
the
criteria
specifically
set
forth
by
the
legal
document
which
no
one
to
this
date
has
objected
to
and
all
agree
as
the
criteria
by
which
historic
bay
status
is
achieved.
that
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
had
established
a
usage
over
all
of
cook
inlet.
two
expert
witnesses
in
the
area,
in
the
field
of
history
again
alaska
complied
with
what
this
court
had
set
to
be
the
evidentiary
standard
and
cases
of
this
sort
that
is,
they
are
principally
factual
cases
left
to
the
discretion
of
a
trier
of
fact
to
determine.
based
upon
unrefuted
evidence,
the
trier
of
fact
in
this
case
found
that
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states
had
been
exercised,
had
developed
into
a
usage
over
all
of
cook
inlet
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
perhaps
the
most
interesting
feature
of
this
case
is
the
third
requirement
and
that
is
the
requirement
of
acquiescence.
first,
i
would
like
to
deal
since
it
was
dealt
at
length
in
the
solicitor's
argument
with
the
shelikof
strait
incident.
contrary
to
the
united
states'
position
and
this
is
undisputed
again
in
the
facts.
consistently
throughout
this
case,
both
in
the
trial
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
now
this
court,
the
government
has
refused
to
recognize
the
significance
of
this
incident
with
respect
to
cook
inlet.
one
need
only
refer
to
the
japanese
note
of
protest
which
appears
at
page
3
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
united
states'
brief.
the
japanese,
notwithstanding
what
the
united
states
now
says
certainly
believed
that
the
sovereignty
asserted
by
the
state
of
alaska
was
over
cook
inlet.
they
certainly
believed
that
the
agreement
entered
into
by
the
japanese
fishermen
not
to
fish
in
shelikof
strait
and
cook
inlet
applied
to
cook
inlet.
the
note
itself
says,
the
commitment
made
by
the
east
specific
fisheries
company
to
the
alaska
state
authorities
to
abstain
from
operations
in
the
shelikof
strait
and
the
cook
inlet
was
made
without
knowledge
of
the
government
of
japan.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
that
appendix
reference
is
page
3
(a)
on
the
brief
of
the
united
states.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes,
it's
the
last
--
it's
the
page
right
before
the
map
at
the
very
end
of
the
book,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
arrest
of
the
ships
is
important.
however,
more
significant
are
the
actions
of
japan
and
the
united
states
subsequent
to
the
arrest,
faced
with
the
agreement
not
to
fish
in
waters
of
cook
inlet,
what
did
the
japanese
do?
the
japanese
did,
it
is
true
and
the
record
is
undisputed
enter
a
protest.
however,
in
response
to
this
protest,
the
united
states
never
at
any
time
recognized
or
admitted
to
japan
or
proclaimed
to
japan
that
the
waters
involved
to
with
shelikof
strait
and
cook
inlet
were
international
waters.
in
fact,
it
said,
this
is
a
question
which
is
more
properly
left
to
the
decision
of
a
court
and
this
was
done,
this
response
incidentally
was
done
contrary
to
the
advice
of
mr.
yingling
who
was
then
the
responsible
attorney
for
these
matters
in
the
department
of
state.
that
is
what
the
united
states
did
but
even
more
significant
is
what
did
the
japanese
do?
from
that
time,
the
japanese
have
not
fished
in
cook
inlet.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
i
fully
agree
that
the
arrest
had
to
do
with
shelikof
strait
but
what
is
important
is
the
agreement
entered
into
after
shelikof
strait
to
which
the
japanese
note
--
upon
which
the
japanese
has
note
commented
and
the
actions
of
japan
in
face
of
that
agreement,
after
the
agreement
was
entered
into
and
after
its
note
of
protest
complaining
about
the
agreement's
application
to
cook
inlet.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
that
is
correct
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
is
the
agreement
which
was
referred
to
and
complained
about
in
the
japanese
note.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
aside
from
the
fact
that
we
are
dealing
in
what
is
essentially
a
civil
case
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
rely
on
the
agreement
as
acquiescence
by
the
japanese.
we
do
rely
on
the
response
of
the
japanese
government
after
the
agreement
was
entered
into
and
after
the
protest
was
made,
that
being
the
fact
that
in
face
of
continuing
state
of
alaska
jurisdiction
over
cook
inlet
as
expressed
through
its
regulations
which
the
testimony
again
uncontestedly
points
out
was
disseminated
to
japan,
that
is
regulations
which
state
all
of
cook
inlet
within
the
line,
gore,
douglas,
barren
islands
are
waters
of
alaska
for
over
which
it
asserts
jurisdiction.
in
face
of
those
agreements,
the
japanese
have
not
entered
cook
inlet.
they
have
refrained
from
entering
cook
inlet
and
this
we
feel
is
the
significant
fact.
the
governor
of
alaska
testified
that
the
japanese
have
not
entered
cook
inlet
and
the
evidence
bears
this
point
out.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
only
recorded
incident
of
their
entering
cook
inlet
is
mr.
ishi
mori's
testimony
at
the
trial
where
for
approximately
six
hours,
the
japanese
fleet
was
in
an
area
north
of
the
barren
islands
on
route
to
shelikof
strait.
there
is
no
other
reported
incident
and
that
incident,
may
it
please
the
court,
was
not
observed
by
officials
of
the
state
of
alaska.
so,
we
contend
that
the
actions
of
japan
subsequent
to
the
agreement
clearly
are
acquiescence.
there
is
one
other
point
i
should
like
to
make.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
i
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
fact,
mr.
justice
is
that
the
japanese
protested
the
application
of
the
agreement
to
cook
inlet
and
they
expressed
concern
over
that
apparently
and
in
face
of
their
protest,
they
have
abstained
from
fishing
in
cook
inlet.
they,
thus,
felt
that
was
of
some
significance
but
they
have
not
followed
up.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes,
they
have.
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
they
felt
apparently
mr.
justice
that
they
had
a
right
to
do
so
or
else
they
would
not
have
protested.
they
have
advocated
that
right
by
discontinuing
their
protest.
that
is
--
that
coupled
with
the
absence
of
the
fishing
is
the
important
fact
demonstrating
acquiescence.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
we
feel
mr.
justice
that
that
is
not
crucial
to
the
disposition
of
this
cause.
we
do
not
admit
nor
do
we
feel
the
record
does
indicate
that
russians
at
any
time
ever
abandoned
sovereignty
to
cook
inlet.
however,
since
the
assertions
of
jurisdiction
by
the
united
states
and
the
state
have
been
so
longstanding
since
that
time
we
feel
that
it
has
no
bearing
upon
what
this
court
should
decide
with
respect
to
this
case.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
we
feel
that
it
did
equate
with
acquiescence.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes,
we
do,
although
i
would
be
very
glad
to
answer
that
question
if
i
may.
we
feel
that
the
gharrett-scudder
line
is
an
indication
of
canada's
acquiescence
in
cook
inlet
and
i
will
briefly
state
why
the
line
was
drafted
upon
canada's
recognition
and
this
is
important.
it
recognized
the
regulations
which
had
been
drafted
by
the
united
states
relative
to
fishing
in
alaska.
this
particular
regulation
defined
the
waters
of
alaska
as
extending
three
miles,
three
miles
which
can
only
relate
to
territorial
sea
from
lines
extending
from
headland
to
headland
across
the
entrances
of
bays.
this
regulation
adopted
in
1957
was
apparent
to
canada
since
they
asked
for
charts
which
delimited
the
line
and
alaska
described
by
the
regulation
which
in
fact
defined
waters
of
alaska.
the
charts
were
prepared
and
transmitted
to
canada
from
the
united
states
embassy
in
ottawa
in
1957
showing
cook
inlet
to
be
within
the
line
from
which
the
three-mile
limit
was
measured.
the
testimony
of
william
terry
indicated
that
as
to
cook
inlet,
the
japanese
had
no
quarrel
and
there
has
never
been
an
objection
registered
by
canada
as
to
the
placement
of
the
gharrett-scudder
line
with
respect
to
cook
inlet.
there
was
some
minor
dispute
as
to
something
down
in
the
strait
of
juan
de
fuca
and
something
in
southeastern
alaska
but
not
as
to
cook
inlet.
this,
we
consider
to
be
acquiescence
by
canada
as
to
the
assertion
of
sovereignty
by
the
united
states
through
a
regulation
defining
the
three-mile
limit
in
cook
inlet.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
record
mr.
justice
and
the
finding
of
the
court
is
that
this
was
done
in
1957
subsequent
to
statehood.
there
have
been
five
vessels
undetected
in
cook
inlet
with
and
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
that's
correct,
they
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
the
records
of
the
pacific
halibut
commission
when
a
vessel
enters
any
waters
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
halibut
commission,
it
must
file
records
with
that
commission
as
to
where
this
fish
and
some
of
those
records,
exhibit
78
and
80
indicated
--
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
yes,
but
more
important
mr.
justice
is
that
some
of
the
records
also
indicated
fairly
that
the
canadian
vessels
were
within
the
three-mile
limit
of
cook
inlet.
there
is
one
which
indicates
it
was
within
chisik
island.
the
record
also
indicates
that
as
to
canadian
halibut
vessels,
the
policy
of
the
united
states
fish
and
wildlife
service
was
to
be
lenient
and
the
record
also
indicates
that
in
the
case
of
more
serious
fisheries
where
jurisdiction,
where
sovereignty
is
truly
threatened.
howard
balso
indicated
that
in
the
case
of
a
canadian
salmon
vessel,
enforcement
action
would
probably
have
been
taken.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
mr.
justice,
there
were
three
vessels
involved,
the
banshu
maru
and
i
believe
two
mother
ships
or
two
other
sister
ships.
the
--
one
of
the
ships
was
clearly
within
three
miles.
one
of
the
ships
was
clearly
outside
of
three
miles.
i
believe
the
record
is
clear
and
there
is
no
dispute
that
one
of
the
ships
seized
was
outside
the
three-mile
limit
at
the
time
it
was
seized.
governor
egan's
testimony
again
is
unrefuted
on
this
point.
mr.
charles
k.
cranston
thank
you,
your
honor.
