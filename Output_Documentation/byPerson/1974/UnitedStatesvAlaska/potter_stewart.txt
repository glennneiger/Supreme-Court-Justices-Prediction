the

north
and
east
of
kalgin
island,
that's
a
juridical
bay,
isn't
it
concededly?
justice

and
i
suppose
there
are
some
juridical
bays?

kachemak
bay
for
example
--

kamishak
bay.

over

shore,
as
you
say
might
include
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
inland
waters.
it
might
be
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
shore
doesn't
mean
land,
that's
what
i
gather?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
been
pretty
aggressive
and
claims
to
the
outer
continental
shelf,
have
we
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that
and
our
claims
were
quite
extreme.
justice
potter
stewart
the
party
gives
much
weight
to
the
era
when
russia
was
in
control
of

did
they
destroy,
although,
there
is
some
history.

so,
you're
not
going
to
deal
with
that
at
all.

shelikof
strait
is
not
an
issue
here,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
thought
it
was
rather
clear
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
three
miles
out
of
kodiak
island
and
from
the
mainland
of
alaska,
of
course,
there's
territorial
sea
and
the
shelikof
strait,
but
otherwise,
the
waters
of
the
shelikof
strait
are
international
waters.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
--
the
waters
of
the
shelikof
strait
are
not
at
all
an
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
my
point
and
my
question
to.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
what
you're
telling
us
about
the
effect
of
white
act
is
certainly
a
strongly
controverted
by
the
secretary
entrusted
with
its
enforcement
that
is
and
the
secretary
udall
back
in
april
of
1962
who
says
these
regulations
were
not
intended
to
enlarge
or
extend
the
territorial
waters
of
alaska
in
a
legal
or
jurisdictional
sense.
he
also
says
that
they
were
enforced
only
three
years,
1957,
1958,
1959
and
never
enforced
against
any
foreign
nationals.

--
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
true,
is
it
not
that
the
way
that
they
act
was
not
ever
enforced
against
non-americans?
justice

stewart
not
netting
salmon,
didn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
didn't
have
primarily
to
do
with
netting
of
salmon?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
on
paragraph
4
of
japan's
protest.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
problem
with
this
japanese
seizure
in
1962
was
that
it
was
not
in
cook
inlet
but
it
was
in
shelikof
strait
and
that
has
--
that's
all
spelled
out
in
japan's
protest.
in
any
reference
to
cook
inlet
is
equivalent
or
analogous
to
what
we
call
casual
dicta
um
in
the
court
opinion.
it
seems
to
me,
it
has
had
to
do
with
the
seizure
in
shelikof
strait
which
is
not
an
issue
here
in
this
case
at
all.
after
the
protest
was
about.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
fact
is
that
canadian
fishermen,
mullet
fishermen
have
been
in
there
since.
justice
potter
stewart
how
does
anybody
know
they
were
there?
justice
potter
stewart
how
do
we
know
they
were
there,
if
they
were
undetected?
justice
potter
stewart
show
that
they
were
in
cook
inlet.
justice
potter
stewart
back
in
his
1962
japanese
seizure
incident,
there
seems
to
be
some
--
nobody
seems
to
have
known
where
the
otori
maru
was
seized.
was
that
ever
established,
one
of
the
