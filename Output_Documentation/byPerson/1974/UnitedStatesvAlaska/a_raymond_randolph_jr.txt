mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
issue
is
whether
a
disputed
area
in
lower
cook
inlet
in
alaska
constitutes
historic
inland
waters
as
the
state
claims
or
constitutes
areas
of
the
high
seas
as
the
united
states
maintains.
the
issue
arose
in
the
following
context.
in
march
of
1967,
the
state
of
alaska
offered
for
a
competitive
oil
and
gas
lease
sale
2500
acres
of
submerged
land
in
the
portion
of
cook
inlet
in
dispute.
the
united
states
brought
suit
shortly
thereafter
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
alaska
to
quiet
title
and
for
injunctive
relief
arguing
that
the
state
had
no
authority
to
lease
submerged
lands
in
area
of
the
high
seas.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
inquired
about
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
because
i
was
not
there
at
that
time.
my
understanding
is
that
that
disclosing
all
the
details
that
the
idea
was
not
the
burden
of
this
court
with
the
--
what
appeared
to
be
at
the
time
a
quite
simple
case.
unfortunately,
i
think
that
--
i
think
that
prediction
was
not
a
very
good
one.
and
the
case
is
now
here.
alaska
claimed
that
in
response
that
cook
inlet
is
a
historic
inland
waters
and
therefore
the
state
had
title
to
the
submerged
lands.
the
district
court
compiled
a
--
in
the
district
court,
the
parties
compiled
a
record
and
after
an
eight-day
trial,
the
district
court
issued
a
memorandum
opinion
holding
for
the
state
of
alaska
dismissing
the
united
states
complaint.
the
court
instructed
counsel
for
the
state
of
alaska
to
prepare
findings
of
fact,
conclusions
of
law
which
counsel
did
in
court
subsequently
signed.
the
united
states
appealed.
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
in
a
per
curiam
opinion.
the
court
of
appeals
subsequently
state
its
mandate
regarding
foreign
fishing
under
disputed
areas
of
cook
inlet
on
motion
of
the
united
states
matter
which
i'll
discuss
later
that
the
case
is
here
at
all,
that
there's
any
question
whatsoever
about
the
status
of
cook
inlet
is
a
function
of
its
size
and
for
convenience,
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
map
in
the
back
of
our
brief.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
it's
the
map,
mr.
justice
brennan
in
the
back
of
the
brief.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
can't
emphasize
enough
that
this
is
a
vast
area,
incredibly
vast.
there's
a
line,
the
court
will
observe,
a
kalgin
island
to
the
north
in
cook
inlet,
it's
developed
later
as
a
24-mile
closing
line.
from
that
line
down
to
the
line
drawn
across
cape
douglas
to
the
west
and
point
gore
to
the
east,
as
i
said
before,
is
a
vast
area
of
water.
one
could
easily
fit
within
that
area
all
of
the
chesapeake
bay,
all
of
the
delaware
bay
and
all
of
long
island
sound.
in
the
area
above
the
line
at
cook
inlet,
one
could
fit
another
delaware
bay
and
another
long
island
sound.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
have
the
square
mile
areas
that
the
geographer
of
the
state
department
gave
me
after
using
maps
in
the
overlays.
so,
i
could
give
them
to
the
court.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they're
not
in
the
record
and
other
than
by
the
maps
and
these
are
material
developed
in
the
maps.
the
disputed
area
constitutes
approximately
5400
square
miles,
the
entire
inlets
about
7400
square
miles.
delaware
bay
and
this
is
from
the
1946,
1940
bureau
of
census
report,
delaware
base
about
665
square
miles,
chesapeake
bay
3200
square
miles,
long
island
sound
about
13,000
miles.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
sir.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
there
are
juridical
bays
within
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes
and
kamishak
bay.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
to
the
west
are
juridical
bays.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
there's
a
map
in
the
second
volume
of
the
appendix
that
is
bound
up
in
the
volume
that
clearly
indicates
that
is
the
map
that
the
united
states
scripted
at
the
foreign
countries
in
1971.
the
question
here
is
whether
within
the
disputed
area,
the
state
of
alaska
owns
a
submerged
land
and
state
entered
the
union
in
1959
on
same
terms
as
the
other
state
and
was
subject
to
the
submerged
lands
act
which
gave,
in
which
the
united
states
conferred
title
on
states
three
geographic
miles
from
the
seaward
boundary
of
their
inland
waters.
the
question
thus
becomes
whether
this
area
constitutes
inland
waters
and
the
court,
this
court
in
the
california
case,
instructed
that
one
must
look
to
the
convention
of
territorial
seas
for
the
definition
of
what
constitutes
inland
waters.
at
this
point,
i'd
like
to
pause
and
i
know
the
court
is
well
aware
of
this
but
in
a
summary
fashion,
the
international
law
recognize
as
a
three-fold
division
of
the
sea.
inland
waters
are
bodies
of
waters
that
are
partly
within
the
territory
of
a
nation.
the
nation
has
complete
sovereignty
over
those
waters.
it
can
deny
the
right
of
entry
to
any
foreign
vessel
and
has
the
right
to
exclude
foreigners
from
entry
into
those
waters.
moving
out
from
the
inland
waters,
one
reaches
the
territorial
sea
which
is
a
specified
sea
where
the
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
is
a
traditionally
three
geographic
miles.
the
state
or
nation
has
complete
sovereignty
over
that
area
of
the
territorial
sea
but
it
must
allow
innocent
passage
of
vessels
through
that.
beyond
the
territorial
sea
lies
the
high
seas
where
normally
a
state
may
not
exercise
control.
however,
in
light
of
the
convention
that
i've
just
mentioned,
there
is
a
contiguous
zone
between
the
--
that
runs
along
the
territorial
sea
and
in
the
high
seas
and
for
special
purposes,
the
nation
may
exercise
control.
united
states
has
done
that.
as
we've
extended
our
exclusive
fishery
jurisdiction
out,
nine
additional
miles
from
the
three-mile
territorial
sea.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
beginning
at
the
three-mile
line.
its
12
miles
from
shore
from
the
low
mean
watermark
and
that
was
done
by
statute
and
it
is
now
subject
of
negotiation,
i
understand
the
law
of
the
sea
conference.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
inland
waters.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
yes
sir.
from
the
boundary
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
from
the
coastline.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
from
the
coastline.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
from
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
from
kalgin
island
north.
the
land
across
kalgin
island
mr.
justice
is
24
miles
long,
some
of
the
straight
lines.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
three
miles,
well
that
would
be
territorial,
that's
what
it
is.
but
from
kalgin
island
north
with
what
the
united
states
claims
is
the
only
in
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
well,
the
line,
there's
somewhat
--
the
line
from
cape
douglas
through
barren
island
across
the
point
gore
is
approximately
75
miles
long.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
very
approximately
102
miles.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no,
it's
all
outside
of
the
three-mile.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes.
under
the
convention,
there's
no
question
whatsoever
that
cook
inlet
is
a
bay.
the
convention
in
article
vii
defines
bays
as
well-marked
indentations
whose
penetration
is
such
in
proportion
to
the
width
of
the
coast
that
they
contained
landlocked
waters.
cook
inlet
meets
that
definition
but
under
the
convention,
just
because
a
body
of
water
can
be
defined
as
a
bay,
it
does
not
mean
that
it
contains
inland
waters.
the
convention
prescribes
a
geographic
test
for
determining
whether
a
body
of
water
is
inland
waters.
the
geographic
test
is
whether
the
distance
between
the
natural
headlands
and
the
natural
headlands
here
at
least
the
court
--
the
district
court
said
were
47
miles
wide
that
is
the
net
line
is
not
shown
on
the
map.
it's
from
cape
douglas
to
cape
elizabeth.
it's
approximately
47
miles
and
so
if
you
drew
a
line
across
the
natural
headlands
of
cook
inlet,
one
would
not
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
is
a
juridical
bay
and
you'd
have
to
use
a
fallback
line.
you'd
have
to
move
a
24-mile
line
up
into
the
penetrate
--
the
alaskan
coast
until
you
reach
kalgin
island
and
at
that
point,
you
could
draw
a
24-mile
line
in
closing
the
maximum
area
of
water.
so
the
question
--
if
one
looked
only
at
those
provisions
of
the
convention,
one
would
come
to
the
conclusion
obviously
that
the
area
in
dispute
here
does
not
comprise
inland
waters.
however,
the
provisions
of
the
convention
on
article
7
to
which
i've
just
referred
have
as
a
last
paragraph
the
foregoing
provisions
do
not
apply
to
so-called
historic
bays.
the
question
therefore
is
although
cook
inlet
does
not
comprise
a
juridical
bay
in
the
area
that
we're
talking
about,
does
it
nevertheless
comprise
an
historic
bay.
in
determining
that
question
which
is
one
of
international
law,
this
court
has
looked
to
a
comprehensive
united
nations
study
entitled
the
juridical
regime
of
historic
waters.
three
broad
factors
have
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
an
area
is
historic
waters,
historic
inland
waters,
one
that
exercise
of
authority
by
the
claiming
nation
to
the
continuity
of
that
exercise
whether
it's
been
done
for
a
considerable
length
of
time
and
three
of
the
attitude
of
other
nations,
acquiescence
by
other
nations
in
the
exercise,
the
question
becomes
somewhat
unreal
before
this
court
though
because
what
we're
talking
about
is
really
a
domestic
dispute
and
it's
difficult
to
talk
about
the
attitude
of
other
nations
and
claims
being
opposed
when
it's
really
an
internal
dispute
within
the
united
states,
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government
and
therefore
this
court
has
instructed
that
in
looking
at
these
questions,
one
must
treat
them
as
if
made
by
the
national
sovereign
and
oppose
by
other
nations.
in
that
sense,
this
court
approaches
the
problem
as
if
it
were
an
international
tribunal
adjudicating
a
claim
asserted
by
the
united
states
and
opposed
by
other
countries
and
the
rest
of
the
countries
in
the
world.
in
that
light,
it's
quite
important
to
observe
that
the
longstanding
united
states
foreign
policy
has
been
to
limit
national
claims,
territorial
claims
in
the
oceans
of
the
world,
whether
made
by
expanding
inland
waters
or
by
extending
the
territorial
sea
or
in
any
other
matter.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
but
the
outer
continental
shelf
is
not
an
exercise
of
territorial
jurisdiction
so
that
it
excludes
ships
for
example.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
we
may
mine
there
and
we're
in
the
process
mr.
justice
stewart
of
course
in
the
law
of
the
sea
conference
is
now
going
on
and
negotiating.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
--
we
think
that
the
definition
of
international
boundaries
that
the
united
states
has
traditionally
asserted
where
it's
heavily
against
alaska's
assertion
that
in
the
past,
certain
actions
or
inactions
of
the
united
states
gave
rise
to
historic
title.
the
other
nations
of
the
world
are
aware
of
our
foreign
policy
in
regard
to
jurisdictional
boundaries
and
only
the
most
clear
or
direct
in
longstanding
action
by
the
united
states
would
alert
them
to
a
change
of
our
normal
posture
attitude.
we
think
there's
no
such
evidence
here
and
i
would
like
to
discuss
in
sequence,
three
different
incidents
or
groups
of
incidents
on
which
the
district
court
relied
that
we
think
do
not
give
rise
to
historic
title.
first,
there's
the
shelikof
strait
incident.
second,
i'll
discuss
in
general,
fisheries'
regulations.
and
third
of
all,
the
gharrett-scudder
line.
i
might
add
that
nearly
everything
in
this
case
involving
a
claim
or
an
assertion
or
whatever
that
was
relied
upon
to
establish
sovereign
involves
in
some
way
or
another
fishing
regulations.
there
are
some
doing
in
the
19th
century
with
sea
otters
but
nevertheless,
in
the
20th
century,
there
are
mostly
all
fishing
regulations
and
the
shelikof
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
neither
party
nor
the
court.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
there
is
some
history.
the
russian
infiltrator
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
yes,
which
were
quickly
retracted
upon
protest
by
the
united
states
and
great
britain.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i'm
not,
the
district
court,
i
don't
belief
relied
upon
it,
and
i
don't
believe
that
the
counsel
for
the
opposite
side
has
either.
i'm
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
i
--
well,
i'd
like
to
get
to
that.
i
am
--
that's
exactly
what
i'm
going
to
deal
with.
in
the
shelikof
strait
incident,
i
think
i
can
deal
with
it
without
talking
in
terms
of
fishing
but
in
fact
it
was
a
fishing
incident.
the
district
court
turned
this,
the
clearest
assertion
of
sovereignty
and
i
take
it
the
clearest
assertion
that
a
historic
title
had
ripen
as
a
result
of
this
incident.
it
took
place
in
april
of
1962
when
six
japanese
ships
arrived
off
of
the
kodiak
island
fishing
grounds
to
search
for
schools
of
herring.
alaska
knew
ahead
of
time
that
the
japanese
ships
were
coming.
indeed,
the
governor
of
alaska
in
march
of
1962
wrote
to
undersecretary
of
state,
george
ball,
advising
him
of
the
entry
into
the
area
of
the
japanese
fishing
vessels
and
asserting
that
alaska
was
going
to
take
action
if
they
entered
alaskan
waters
and
got
no
response.
the
fishing
vessels
went
around
kalgin
island
in
a
clockwise
direction
of
the
japanese
fishing
vessels
once
and
caught
no
fish
and
by
this
time,
the
governor
of
alaska
was
becoming
concerned.
he
telegrammed
again
to
the
state
department.
the
state
department
sent
a
representative,
mr.
yingling,
to
the
governor's
office
in
junno
and
mr.
yingling
advised
the
governor
that
if
they
entered
cook
inlet,
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
about
it
because
on
an
initial
reading
cook
inlet
comprised
high
seas.
the
fishermen
went
into
cook
inlet
on
april
5th
and
went
around
the
barren
islands
and
then
down
to
the
shelikof
strait.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
barren
islands
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
barren
islands
lie
right
in
the
middle
of
cook
inlet
of
the
line
passing
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
they
went
around
the
barren
islands.
in
the
next
day,
they
sailed
down
into
the
shelikof
strait.
ten
days
later,
75
miles
from
the
nearest
entrance
point
to
cook
inlet,
they
were
seized
and
arrested
by
alaskan
fishing
authorities.
the
fishermen
were
held,
the
captains
of
the
vessel,
of
the
three
vessels
were
held
and
subsequently
signed
four
days
later
in
agreement
stating,
and
this
is
set
out
on
the
--
in
the
appendix
on
pages
1186
to
1188
that
they
would
not
fish
in
the
shelikof
strait,
until
--
“until
final
determination
by
a
court
regarding
whether
the
shelikof
strait
in
adjacent
waters
are
international
waters.”
there
is
no
mention
in
the
agreement
that
these
fishermen
signed
of
cook
inlet.
nevertheless,
on
may
3rd,
japan
protested
the
seizure
of
these
fishing
vessels.
japan
said,
these
are
not
inland
waters.
the
shelikof
strait
has
been
fished
before.
indeed,
we
have
evidence
that
the
japanese
fished
there
in
1961
and
although
we
understand
that
the
questions
to
be
resolved
by
a
court,
we
consider
this
an
international
or
a
unilateral
assertion
of
sovereignty
that
we
will
not
find
binding.
the
united
states
replied
to
the
japanese
note
of
protest
on
april
--
on
june
19th
saying
that
this
was
a
matter
to
be
cited
by
the
court.
the
united
states
pointed
out
that
it
was
not
clear
whether
all
of
the
vessels
that
were
seized
were
within
three
miles
from
the
shore
of
shelikof
strait
in
which
case
if
they
were
within
the
three-mile
limit.
they
were
in
territorial
seas
and
maybe
that
seizure
was
proper
at
that
time.
but
in
any
event,
the
united
states
in
their
response
to
the
protest
said,
“it's
not
clear
to
us
whether
they
were
in
the
high
seas
or
in
the
territorial
seas
and
we'll
leave
that
to
a
court
to
adjudicate.”
the
court
never
did
adjudicate
the
actions
against
the
japanese
who
were
subsequently
dismissed.
the
next
significant
event,
i
suppose,
in
this
sequence
is
that
in
january
of
1963
at
a
breakfast
at
the
whitehouse
where
a
number
of
west
governors
of
western
states
were
present
plus
the
attorney
general
robert
kennedy
and
the
president
john
f.
kennedy
as
in
the
side
the
president
of
the
united
states
said
to
the
governor
of
alaska,
"you
did
the
right
thing."
this,
the
district
court
found
to
be
the
clearest
assertion
of
sovereignty
over
cook
inlet.
we
think
that
that's
a
mistake
of
law
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
number
one,
obviously,
the
seizure
didn't
take
place
in
cook
inlet.
it's
like
arresting
a
ship
off
cape
hatteras
as
an
assertion
of
sovereignty
over
chesapeake
bay.
the
district
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
these
ships
were
tracked
from
the
time
that
they
entered
alaskan
waters
until
the
time
that
they
left.
the
--
that
was
ten
days
later
that
they
were
seized
in
the
shelikof
strait.
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
in
the
record
that
says
that
alaska
could
not
have
seized
them
sooner.
they
went
through
the
shelikof
strait
already
once.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
record
is
totally
unclear
on
that.
it's
page
281
of
the
appendix.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
he
made
a
finding
of
fact.
the
finding
of
fact
is
i
believe
--
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me.
it's
218,
page
218
of
the
first
appendix
is
where
this
was
stated.
but
he
said,
the
governor
was
told
by
the
president
that
he
did
a
right
--
the
right
thing
in
seizing
the
vessels.
that's
not
what
the
governor's
--
the
governor's
testimony
was
but
we'll
accept
that.
we're
not
challenging
the
findings
of
fact.
even
accepting
that
is
not
clear
that
the
vessels
were
they
were,
whether
they
were
in
the
territorial
sea
or
within
the
high
seas.
more
than
that,
we
don't
even
think
this
is
a
clear
assertion
of
sovereignty
over
shelikof
strait,
let
alone
cook
inlet
75
miles
away
because
of
the
fact
that
it's
never
really
been
determined
exactly
where
these
vessels
were,
whether
they
were
in
the
high
sea
otherwise
known
as
the
high
sea
areas.
second
of
all,
and
more
important,
i
suppose,
is
that
this
could
hardly
be
considered
an
incident
to
give
rise
to
a
historic
title.
one
of
the
requirements
is
that
other
states,
nations,
acquiesce
and
assertion
of
sovereignty.
so,
even
if
this
were
a
clear
assertion
which
we
don't
think
it
is.
even
if
this
were
an
assertion
of
sovereignty
over
cook
inlet,
nevertheless,
it's
met
by
an
immediate
response
of
protest
by
the
japanese
government.
on
top
of
that,
in
regard
to
the
shelikof
strait
itself,
since
1962,
the
evidence
in
the
record
is
that
russian
throwers
had
been
in
the
strait,
i
cite
appendix
206,
japanese
ships
have
navigated
through
the
strait,
appendix
232
and
canadians
regularly
fish
for
halibut
there.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
no
it's
not.
it's
not.
and
the
question
is
why
does
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
alaska
asserts
sovereignty
over
them.
at
least,
that
is
the
intent
of
their
seizure
of
the
japanese
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
that's
precisely
my
point
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
the
point
is
that
the
district
court
said,
this
was
the
clearest
in
the
entire
record.
this
was
the
clearest
assertion
of
sovereignty
over
cook
inlet,
this
particular
incident
that
i
refer
to.
now,
beyond
that,
there
are
other
fishing
regulations
that
are
involved
in
this
case
that
applied
to
the
cook
inlet
area
from
the
years
1906
until
alaska
became
a
state.
the
one
important
factor
that
i
like
to
bring
about
them
is
that
not
a
single
time
in
the
entire
history
of
this
inlet,
the
disputed
portion
of
this
inlet
was
a
foreign
vessel
or
a
foreign
national
ever
arrested,
ever,
not
one.
now,
could
be,
one
could
say
that
nevertheless,
there
could
be
an
assertion
of
sovereignty
because
cook
inlet
was
so
well
recognized,
so
well
respected
by
the
other
nations
of
the
world
that
date
and
no
nation
dare
to
enter.
no
nation
dared
put
its
ships
into
cook
inlet
without
seeking
specific
permission.
that's
not
the
case
in
regard
to
cook
inlet
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
there
has
been
foreign
fishing
by
canadians
for
halibut,
within
the
inlet.
it's
documented
in
the
record
for
1943
through
to
1970.
now,
i'd
like
to
refer
to
the
court,
the
one
finding
of
the
district
court's
opinion
because
we
don't
dispute
it
but
i
think
it's
rather
misleading.
it's
on
page
101,
or
finding
101
on
page
44
(a)
of
the
appendix.
i'm
sorry,
petition
for
certiorari.
101
says
that
the
--
the
finding
101
says
that
the
fishing
for
halibut
by
canadians
was
de
minimis
because
there
were
possibly
only
two
undetected
instances
before
alaska
statehood
1959
and
after
that,
careful
with
the
language,
only
five
canadian
vessels
have
fished
for
halibut
in
cook
inlet.
that's
absolutely
correct.
what
the
court
has
not
mentioned
is
that
happened
on
20
different
occasions
for
a
total
of
115
days.
nevertheless,
the
point
of
the
court's
holding
in
this
regard
that
one
can
disregard
the
entry
of
canadian
vessels
into
cook
inlet
because
of
their
infrequency
is
in
our
view
a
direct
contradiction
of
international
law.
the
juridical
regime
that
the
court
has
referred
to
points
out
that
it
may
be
that
no
action
is
necessary
but
whenever
any
action
is
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
--
in
order
to
assert
sovereignty
over
a
particular
area,
that
action
must
be
taken
or
historic
title
cannot
ripen.
so
therefore,
canada
or
the
alaska
or
the
united
states
when
the
united
states
have
this
territories,
is
fair
to
take
any
action
against
the
canadian
vessels,
we
think
stops,
prevents
historic
title
from
ripening.
now,
the
district
court
pointed
out,
nevertheless,
there
were
a
great
many
instances
of
action
against
americans,
united
states
citizens
that
were
fishing
in
cook
inlet.
let
me
point
out
that
throughout
the
entire
findings
of
fact
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
in
the
9th
--
in
the
20th
century,
the
district
court
documented
six
arrests
of
american
citizens
prior
to
statehood
within
the
disputed
area
of
the
inlet,
just
six.
after
statehood,
on
one
day,
july
6,
1970,
the
district
court
documented
two
arrests
of
the
united
states
citizens.
there
are
some
testimony
in
the
record
and
we
think
the
district
court
could
not
rely
upon
this
of
officials
at
who
had
various
times
patrol
cook
inlet
who
were
asked,
what
would
you
have
done
had
you
seen
a
foreign
vessel.
they
testified,
“well,
we
would
have
seized
it
or
we
would
have
done
this
or
that.”
the
district
court,
we
think
improperly
relied
upon
that
testimony,
the
requirement
of
international
law
is
that
an
assertion
of
sovereignty
be
open
and
notorious.
it
has
to
give
other
countries
of
the
world
an
opportunity
to
respond.
the
inner
intentions
of
officials
who
patrolled
cook
inlet,
we
do
not
think
rises
to
that
kind
of
open
and
notorious
action
and
the
district
court
properly
relied
upon
it.
as
far
as
fishing
is
concerned
in
general,
the
fact
that
the
united
states
regulates
fishing
of
its
own
citizens
even
on
the
high
seas
is
of
no
consequence
whatsoever
for
determining
whether
internationals
sovereignty,
sovereignty
as
over
inland
waters
has
been
asserted
over
a
particular
area.
the
united
states
can
exercise
sovereignty
or
exercise
authority
over
its
own
united
states
citizens
regardless
of
whether
they're
in
the
territorial
sea,
the
contiguous
zone
or
even
on
the
high
seas
itself.
the
fact
that
in
the
middle
of
cook
inlet,
united
states
citizens,
six
of
them
were
arrested
in
the
20th
century,
to
us
is
meaningless,
to
the
district
court,
quite
important.
we
think
that
was
clear
error.
the
court
also
relied
upon
various
other
particular
actions,
the
alien
fishing
act
that
was
passed
in
1906.
the
district
court
said
this
was
a
clear
assertion,
the
earliest
clear
assertion
of
sovereignty.
i
invite
the
court
to
look
at
the
act
when
it
says
that
no
alien
can
fish
within
the
waters
of
alaska.
that
doesn't
tell
you
where
the
waters
of
alaska
are.
it
doesn't
tell
you
whether
the
united
states
exercised
jurisdiction.
before
i
leave
this
point,
i
think
the
most
important,
one
of
the
most
important
facts
is
that
in
1952
and
again
in
1953,
before
alaska
became
a
state,
there
was
a
controversy
or
question
developed
within
the
bureau
of
fish
and
wildlife
that
was
patrolling
the
area
about
whether
they
could
arrest
the
foreign
vessel
within
the
middle
of
cook
inlet.
they
said
and
they
determined
director
day
who
was
then
the
national
director
of
the
fish
and
wildlife
service
determined
and
instructed
the
people
in
alaska
that
they
could
not
because
the
middle
of
cook
inlet
was
high
seas.
again,
i
think
that
undercuts
any
idea
that
this
is
a
claim
of
sovereignty
and
it
was
error
for
the
district
court
to
rely
upon
these
facts
which
occurred.
nevertheless,
we
think
are
not
relevant.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
right
now.
the
state
says
that
one
of
the
most
significant
assertions
of
sovereignty
over
cook
inlet
were
the
gharrett-scudder
maps.
curiously,
in
the
memorandum
of
opinion
of
the
district
court,
there's
not
a
word
about
the
gharrett-scudder
maps.
they
are
mentioned
in
the
findings
of
fact
but
in
the
opinion
which
sets
forth
the
reasons
why
the
district
court
reads
us
result,
there's
not
a
word
about
the
gharrett-scudder
maps.
the
facts
of
the
maps
which
are
reproduced
as
two
maps
8502
in
the
supplemental
material
here.
they
were
transmitted
to
canada
for
the
purpose
of
fisheries
management.
the
idea
was
that
canada
wanted
to
see
where
the
high
seas
area
would
be
when
the
united
states
would
prevent
net
fishing
as
examined
by
its
own
united
states
citizens.
the
maps
if
the
court
looks
at
them
were
drawn
in
straight
lines.
the
united
states
does
not
use
straight
lines
to
define
its
international
boundaries.
it
uses
--
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
8502,
there
are
two
maps.
mr.
a.
raymond
randolph,
jr.
8502.
united
states
does
not
use
straight
base
lines.
it
uses
sinuosities
that
follows
the
coastline.
it
draws
undulations.
on
top
of
that,
canada
could
have
hardly
conceived
this
as
an
assertion
of
sovereignty
if
it
looked
at
the
straight
baselines
it
would
be
a
sudden
departure.
the
maps
were
drawn
by
two
department
of
interior
employees
which
makes
it
suspect
immediately
how
could
that
be
that
one
would
suspect
that
the
geographers
of
the
state
department
would
set
the
international
boundaries.
but
beyond
that
there
are
not
even
straight
baselines
in
conformity
with
the
convention
because
the
convention
requires
for
straight
baselines
that
the
lines
touch
land
each
time
a
straight
line
is
drawn.
if
you
look
at
this
map,
you'll
find
islands
that
are
ringed
by
square
lines.
they
don't
even
conform
to
that.
in
point
of
fact,
the
district
court
relied
upon
this.
we
think
it
was
a
mistake.
i
won't
mention
the
disclaimers.
i
think
they're
adequately
dealt
within
the
record.
thank
you.
