mr.
james
h.
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
this
is
the
durational
--
durational
residency
requirement
case.
it
is
a
developing
area
of
the
law
that
the
court
is
aware.
we
are
raising
the
constitutional
question
of
the
iowa
durational
residency
requirement
for
access
to
the
domestic
courts
of
iowa.
it's
an
iowa
statute
requiring
one
year
residency
before
you
have
access
to
the
courts
basing
it
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
if
both
of
the
parties
moved
in
to
iowa
together,
then
it
does
not
apply,
it
only
if
one
of
the
parties
moves
in.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
other
party
is
not
a
resident.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
a
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
i
think
the
narrower
the
classification,
the
easier
it
is
to
argue
on
an
equal
protection
question
if
there's
no
rational
relationship
to
the
narrow
group
that
is
excluded
and
i
think
that
ours
because
it
is
a
more
narrow
restriction,
it's
probably
easier
to
argue
because
of
the
fact
that
it
applies
only
to
non-residence
where
there's
a
non-resident
out
of
the
state
other
party,
whereas
both
has
moved
into
the
state
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
even
for
a
week
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
for
some
reason,
the
state
feels
it
has
some
compelling
interest
over
parties
which
are
one
of
--
one
of
them
isn't
in
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
think
that's
probably
true
but
i
think
that's
probably
the
reason
for
there's
a
durational
residency
requirement
has
cause
divorce
mills
to
occur
and
i
think
that
striking
down
on
such
a
durational
residency
requirements
will
take
care
of
that
problem
and
that
the
states
can
litigate
the
proper
status
of
those
parties
in
the
state
where
the
real
interest
lies.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
i
think
that
in
the
instance
that
if
we
use
the
criterion
that
we
have
advocate
as
the
real
jurisdictional
question
once
the
court
has
said
in
the
past
to
be
the
jurisdictional
question
which
is
domicile
that
the
domicile
of
the
party
is
the
real
interest
to
which
the
state
has
and
the
fact
that
the
domicile
of
the
other
party
is
only
peripheral
to
the
interest
that
they
have
because
of
the
many
concomitant
things
that
go
with
the
marital
situations
such
as
a
severance,
such
as
a
custody,
support,
division
of
property
and
the
attend
and
other
things
that
go
with
it.
such
as
in
iowa,
we
have
requirement
of
reconciliation,
the
injunctions
that
would
be
necessary
or
proper
to
preserve
the
peace
or
property
and
these
things
we
feel
are
the
real
issue
and
that
the
citizen
has
in
the
divorce
court,
the
non-resident
or
a
resident
domiciliary
of
the
state
who
cannot
overcome
the
jurisdictional
one
year
requirement.
he
cannot
have
for
instance
a
--
the
severance
of
the
relationship
which
is
possible
to
a
non-resident
who
moves
in
with
his
spouse
and
then
the
other
spouse
would
for
instance
move
out
after
the
action
has
been
commenced.
if
there
is
a
severe
reason
for
an
immediate
severance,
we
don't
have
to
wait
the
90
days
that
are
normally
required
for
divorce
but
if
it
was
a
one
party
was
from
out
of
the
state,
it
had
wait
a
full
year
and
90
days
possibly
or
at
least
a
year
before
they
get
an
access
to
the
court.
the
custody
of
the
offspring
and
i
feel
this
is
very
important
and
why
many
times
access
to
the
court
is
quite
urgent
because
of
the
fact
that
the
ramifications
of
the
separate
families
if
we
don't
make
the
ties
cutoff
that
the
ramifications
and
the
effect
upon
children
and
the
offspring
of
the
marriage
can
be
affected
to
a
great
extent
and
that
therefore
you
should
be
able
to
get
in
at
least
as
far
as
the
parties
are
concerned
and
that
the
custody
questions
can
be
litigated
so
you
don't
have
this
situation,
the
parties
running
from
state
to
state
with
children
trying
to
get
the
other
state
to
give
them
custody
that
we
could
get
this
matters
litigated
and
that
the
offspring
could
be
better
protected
if
they
let
a
chance
to
get
to
the
court
and
the
support
of
those
persons,
the
division
of
the
properties
so
that
there
could
be
certain
injunctory
orders
entered
to
preserve
the
status
quo
so
that
disposition
of
the
properties
that
the
parties
that
they're
leaving
in
another
state,
don't
dispose
of
the
properties
or
do
something
with
them
so
that
when
it
comes
time
to
take
care
of
the
offspring
that
there
are
things
available.
for
instance,
there
are
statute
to
counseling,
there's
no
counseling.
the
state
of
iowa
has
maintained
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
one
year
residency
requirement
is
this
got
somehow
going
to
preserve
the
union
that
we
feel
that
however
immediate
access
to
the
courts
would
allow
the
order
for
some
type
of
word
of
counseling
which
may
be
more
beneficial
than
having
two
parties
in
opposite
--
in
separate
state
sitting
and
wondering
about
their
situation
for
a
year.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we
try
to
but
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we
presented
it
in
the
pleadings
and
the
fact
that
we
are
required
under
the
statute
in
question
to
plead
the
fact
of
one
year
residency
requirement
is
to
be
pled.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
claim
was
rejected
by
judge
keck
and
he
rejected
not
on
the
basis
that
he
passed
on
the
question
and
as
he
said
that
he
felt
he
was
in
the
position
to
pass
upon
the
constitutional
question
when
the
statute
upon
his
facing
to
be
quite
certain
and
that
he
didn't
want
to
go
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we'll,
because
of
the
status
of
the
case
is
at
the
time
it
appeared
that
only
preservation
under
a
situation
where
there
was
little
or
no
dispute
to
write
the
statute
itself
that
the
state
courts
have
been
very
reluctant
to
get
into
the
constitutional
issue.
they
would
always
avoid
it
has
been
the
habit
of
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we
could
present
it
to
him
again
and
reject
it
but
the
court
system
then
was
in
fact
depriving
the
--
under
1983
was
depriving
the
citizens
of
his
civil
rights
which
had
been
by
history
the
prerogative
or
had
been
the
place
that
had
been
litigated
was
in
the
federal
court
and
therefore
the
federal
court
would
be
their
proper
forum
to
litigate
this
one.
in
fact,
the
state
law
which
was
depriving
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
a
constitutional
right
was
being
deprived.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
raised
by
the
special
appearance
of
the
--
mr.
sosna
who
came
in
and
raised
the
special
appearance
and
then
it
was
litigated
not
by
us
but
by
them
because
the
question
had
been
raised
as
to
his
right
to
be
litigated.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
he
was
then
litigated
but
i
don't
like
term
litigate,
i
don't
feel
it
was
litigated.
we
tried
to
present
the
case
and
judge
keck
says,
that
he
was
not
--
did
not
want
make
pass
upon
that
and
he
didn't,
i
don't
think
he
ever
intended
to
make
a
judicial
decision
on
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
dismissed
it.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
he
didn't
decide
that
we
had
no
claim.
he
just
said
that
the
statute
says
that
you
cannot
have
access
to
our
courts
period.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
because
we're
going
back
in
the
federal
court
in
litigating
really
the
state
as
you
--
as
the
party,
the
original
party
was
mr.
sosna,
we
have
no
different
parties.
and
we're
talking
about
the
state,
the
state
under
color
of
law,
is
trying
to
deprive
us
of
a
constitutional
right,
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts
to
litigate
a
very
essential
and
necessary
right
to
which
is
that
of
a
marriage
relationship
and
all
of
the
concomitant
things
that
arise
from
it,
the
very
basic,
we
feel
very
basic
right.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
because
of
--
i
think
because
of
the
fact
of
the
status
of
the
law
at
the
time,
the
law
was
very
certain
they
put
to
the
question
of
durational
residency
requirement
had
been
struck
down
in
the
past
by
other
federal
courts
and
i
think
if
we
should
look
from
our
brief,
you
can
see
that
when
you
split
up
the
cases
between
those
that
have
sustained
the
durational
residency
requirement
and
those
that
have
struck
them
down,
it
has
been
almost
the
majority
of
the
state
courts
in
the
federal
court
however
is
always
vindicated
the
rights,
the
constitutional
rights
because
that
had
been
the
proper
forum.
and
that
when
it
was
a
very,
as
the
court
said,
a
very
certain
statute
on
its
face,
there
wasn't
any
way
normally
that
you
say,
okay
we're
going
to
litigate
it
further
in
the
state
court,
if
there's
any
chance
that
you
might
have
a
chance
of
changing
the
opinion
or
having
the
matter
at
least
under
1983
case
that
there
could
be
some
construction
of
the
statute
which
would
in
fact
give
you
a
vindication
of
those
rights
and
that
there
would
be
no
such
vindication
and
its
superfluous
to
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
--
require
them
to
proceed.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
that's
true
they
did.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
what
i
was
taking
was
as
a
lawyer
looking
at
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
it
has
been
historically
true
that
they
confine
the
decision
or
reason
more
compelling
which
would
justify
the
durational
residency
requirement.
we
feel
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
--
that
find
a
more
sufficient
reason
as
the
--
as
in
our
particular
case
two
of
the
three
federal
judges
found
that
the
interest
is
somehow
was
going
to
preserve,
that
this
was
somehow
going
to
preserve
the
marital
situation
and
that
if
you
look
at
the
decisions
which
have
sustained
the
state
court
decision
which
has
sustained
these
durational
residency
requirements,
they've
gone
from
filler
to
post
under
reasons
that
they
felt
that
somehow
was
going
to
sustain
these
--
for
some
reason
we're
going
to
help
the
marriage
or
we're
going
to
preserve
a
compelling
state
interest
which
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
durational
remedy
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
that
is
the
best
of
our
research,
it
hasn't.
the
iowa
court
spoken
(voice
overlap)
however
over,
over
again
in
the
past.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
i
suppose
you
just
have
to
as
a
lawyer.
look
at
what
the
history
has
been
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
the
history
of
state
court
decisions
in
regards
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
anyway
we
all
have
an
iowa
right.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
it's
unique
in
regards
to
durational
residency
requirement
but
i
don't
think
it
therefore
makes
it
anymore
easy
for
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
to
decide
it.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
because
of
the
fact
that
they
have
always
found
that
there
was
some
compelling
state
interest
which
we
have
felt
that
there
was
no
such
compelling
state
interest
and
that
the
federal
courts
whenever
were
presented
with
the
case
always
found
that
there
was
not
a
compelling
state
interest
that
the
history
of
the
federal
decisions
in
regards
to
marital
relationship
was
it
was
one
of
the
most
basic
of
the
relationships
and
therefore
that
to
deprive
someone
under
color
of
law
whether
by
a
court
or
some
jury,
some
residency
requirement
was
in
fact
one
of
the
very
basic
things
that
was
at
issue
and
that
therefore
the
line
of
cases
of
shapiro
in
welfare
cases,
and
dunn
in
the
voting
cases,
and
memorial
hospital
in
the
non-emergency
medical
care
that
these
were
all
the
same
type
of
situations.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
felt
more
favorable
atmosphere
because
of
the
fact
that
that
is
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
--
recently
been
the
forum
of
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
if
we
didn't
start
it
on
the
state
action,
we
would
be
on
a
rather
moot
position
to
go
on
and
say
that
we
would
like
to
have
a
divorce,
start
a
divorce
but
we
can't
because
of
the
residency
requirement.
if
you
don't
start
it
you
could
then
turn
on
and
say
well,
how
do
you
know
you
really
have
broken
marriage?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
think
there
is
a
--
sure
there's
a
declaratory
judgment
statute
but
the
question
was
whether
or
not
it's
really
at
issue
then.
is
it
a
justiciable
situation
or
controversy
if
you
have
in
fact
a
larger
divorce
action?
how
do
you
know
for
sure
that
you
really
have
a
divorce?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
there
is
a
separate
maintenance
statute
in
iowa.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
that
also
has
a
requirement.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
issue
of
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
don't
believe
it
was.
the
matter
solely
turned
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well
then,
the
criminal
part
of
it,
i've
--
you
know
as
an
old
prosecutor,
i
know
how
important
it
is
to
keep
your
prosecution
going
once
you've
got
the
machinery
going
and
that
therefore
that
interest
is
far
different
than
that
of
a
civil
litigation
where
you're
alleging
that
the
civil
litigation
and
the
judge
in
the
under
color
of
the
state
law
is
in
fact
depriving
a
citizen
of
his
basic
federal
constitutional
right
and
i
think
that's
quite
different
because
of
the
nature
of
the
criminal
process
which
is
different
than
the
civil
process
and
therefore
has
rises
above
and
maybe
is
a
more
compelling
state
interest
in
the
prosecution
of
criminals.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
on
res
judicata
as
to
issue
or
claim
or
as
to
parties
or
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
think
that
if
we
had
brought
the
case
against
iowa
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
--
as
against
to
mr.
sosna
i
think
we
could.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
don't
know
how
we
could
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action
against
another
party
to
the
marriage.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
i
--
but
the
marriage
situation
is
you're
certainly
litigating
the
marriage
situation
and
you
can't
get
a
declaratory
judgment
out
of
it.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
without
first
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right,
that's
a
1983
case.
we're
saying
that
the
state
by
enacting
a
statute
is
in
fact
depriving
us
of
our
constitutional
rights
that
we've
judge
--
we've
joined
judge
keck
in
it
because
the
fact
that
he
under
color
of
law
is
in
fact
depriving
us
of
a
basic
constitutional
right.
otherwise,
you
might
as
well
throw
1983
out
the
window
if
you're
going
to
say
that
if
you
bring
a
state
court
action
and
the
judges
use
the
state
court
law
and
to
deprive
you
of
your
constitutional
right,
you
can't
raise
the
declaratory
judgment
question
as
to
whether
or
not
that
state
law
is
in
fact
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
that
is
an
alternate
proceeding,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
we're
not
really
appealing
(voice
overlap)
to
the
federal
district
court,
we're
asking
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
because
what
we
are
litigating
--
we
started
out
for
a
divorce
action.
we
say
we
wanted
a
divorce.
we
wind
up
having
the
defense
being
frost
upon
us
that
the
fact
that
you
haven't
been
there
for
a
year
and
litigating
our
constitutional
rights
in
the
state
court.
now,
we
then
now
would
turn
around
to
the
federal
court
and
said
we
have
been
deprived
by
the
state
court
under
the
defense
of
no
jurisdiction
and
therefore
we
would
like
to
have
this
court
declare
and
enjoining
the
court
from
using
that
defense
and
to
throwing
us
out
of
court
so
we
can
have
access
to
the
state
court.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we
would
ask
for
an
injunction
against
the
maybe
mandamus
or
something
like
that
and
then
you're
into
--
i
mean
that
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
direct
appeal
to
the
iowa
supreme
court?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
yes,
we
could
have
appealed
that.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we
went
and
ask
the
federal
court
to
declare
and
enjoin
the
state
court
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the,
at
least
had
been
my
experience
with
three-judge
federal
panels
that
if
you've
got
a
civil
rights
that
are
being
deprived
under
color
of
law
by
a
state,
the
quickest
way
you
can
do
it
and
was
thought
to
be
that
by
the
constitution
--
by
the
congress
was
to
enact
1983
and
that
to
me
i
know
is
the
quickest
way
to
vindicate
your
rights
if
you're
being
abused
by
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
believe
so.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
she
has,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
he
could
probably
litigate
the
status
in
iowa
but
not
the
questions
of
personal
jurisdiction
as
to
none
iowa
in
rem
type
of
things.
i
mean
the
status
is
in
iowa
but
anything
else
is
still
in
new
york,
so,
yes,
you
can
probably
get
it
terminated
if
she's
willing
to
give
up
everything,
the
questions
would
delete
it.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
that's
the
whole
point,
you
have
to
wait
a
year
and
there
are
important
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
yes,
but
there
were
important
things
that,
the
laws
over
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
but
there
were
important
things
that
should
have
been
litigated
that
never
were,
for
instance
the
right
and
support
of
those
children
should
have
been
litigated
than
not
having
to
wait
a
year
or
well
maybe
mr.
sosna
might
take
up
other
relationship.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
pardon?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
it
can
be
done
now,
yes
but
the
question
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
declaratory
judgment,
declaratory
of
the
constitutional
right
of
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right,
as
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
this
particular
case
--
this
particular
plaintiff
in
the
class
action?
well,
as
for
this
particular
plaintiff,
her
situation
has
been
resolved
by
time
but
the
length
it
takes
to
litigate
the
matter
but
there
are
other
situations
which
is
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
what
doesn't
give
me
any
problem?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no
because
as
the
court
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
as
judge
stephenson
said
in
his
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
i
believe
not
but
at
least
the
class
was
acknowledged
and
never
challenged
by
anyone
up
to
this
point.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
but
we
had
plenty
of
calls
about
people
that
wanted
to.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
believe
that
there
is
a
president
for
the
class,
we
have
nothing
else
as
to
remand
it
to
the
court
again
and
let
other
members
of
the
class
join
in
if
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
think
it
was
the
babcock
versus
wilson,
i
don't
have
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
she
herself?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
not
as
far
as
the
iowa
court
is.
she
in
fact
has
gone
and
got
a
divorce
and
had
to
go
back
and
litigate
the
matter,
take
a
bus
back
to
new
york
and
had
a
litigator
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
yes,
in
fact
in
new
york.
she
had
to
go
back
to
new
york
in
litigation
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
that's
a
good
question.
cooper
versus
cooper
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
cooper
versus
cooper
raises
the
question
which
is
an
iowa
decision
about
a
doctor
from
iowa
that
went
out
to
nevada
and
get
a
nevada
divorce
and
the
iowa
court
says
we
can
still
--
our
support
judgments
and
personal
judgments
in
regards
to
support.
so
far
there's
nobody
going
to
stand
who
will
acknowledge
the
divorce
in
nevada.
now,
under
iowa
law,
i
have
to
question
as
to
whether
or
not
she
can
get
a
new
york
divorce
and
might
have
a
different
question
as
why
is
the
state
of
iowa
under
the
present
status
of
iowa
law
in
19
--
i
believe
in
19
cooper
versus
cooper
was
a
74
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
pardon?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
now,
it's
the
grade
of
the
divorce
and
the
court
there,
i
mean,
used
their
powers
of
determining
domicile
of
the
doctor
who
left
on
october
and
went
to
nevada,
got
his
divorce
and
came
back
in
january
and
they
went
through
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
domicile
or
not
and
they
said
yes
it
was
domicile
in
nevada
sufficient
for
the
nevada
court
to
have
jurisdiction
or
grant
--
acknowledges
divorce
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
that
she
herself,
no,
but
the
class
to
which
she
is
member
i
think
still
can
because
i
think
that
as
the
state
has
admitted
in
their
stipulation
of
facts
that
it
is
a
group
so
and
its
so
numerous
that
--
were
numerous
than
has
able
to
be
counted
and
i
think
that
there
are
numbers
and
numbers
of
people
who
have
marital
relations
which
are
at
question
and
needed
access
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
i
would
--
at
this
present
status,
yes
she
would
not
be
but
the
class
itself
and
i
would
urge
that
if
the
court
was
to
adopt
the
question
that
they
would
send
it
back
so
that
other
members
of
the
class
who
would
be
members
would
in
fact
be
able
to
join
in
the
matter
and
to
bring
the
matter
back
before
the
court.
i'd
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
possible?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
suppose
they
can
but
as
we've
indicated
that
it's
a
matter
of
urgency
and
a
necessity
and
that's
the
basic
question
about
the
marital
relation,
its
not
a
matter
of
waiting
a
year
because
by
that
time
the
damages
are
done
as
to
the
children,
the
property,
the
relationship
itself
has
deteriorated
and
that
these
are
matters
of
that
need
work
instanter,
that
in
a
year,
that's
the
whole
projection
of
the
question.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
i
believe
i
do
have
that
case
of
babcock
--
cox
versus
babcock
and
wilson
471
f.2d
13,
page
15
in
which
they
did
refer
the
case
back
to
the
court
--
to
the
lower
court
where
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
at
first
boddie
versus
connecticut
which
is
the
other
similar
case
to
this
in
which
the
was
divorce
was
terminated
or
was
never
started
was
because
of
the
fact
of
or
was
allowed
to
proceed
was
because
of
the
failing
to
pay
the
fee
which
is
similar
to
the
situation
here,
and
it
was
never
raised
by
this
court
when
they
determined
boddie
versus
connecticut
that
kind
of
catches
us
here
after
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
matters
already
been
litigated
with
the
whole
new
case
when
we
come
up
before
the
court
that
the
whole
thrust
of
our
argument
and
that
the
argument
now
is
that
somehow
that
federalism
or
committee
or
judicial
husbandry
is
going
to
be
affected
by
you
not
making
a
decision
on
this
matter
is
not
the
case
when
you
look
at
the
fact
that
there
seven
or
eight
state
courts
decisions
all
one
way
and
the
federal
court
decisions
are
the
other
way
with
two
of
the
most
recent
ones,
alaska
and
i
believe
massachusetts
finally
going
--
coming
our
way
and
in
fact
the
fiorentino
case
in
massachusetts
even
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
court
had
made
a
three-judge
federal
panel
had
made
a
decision
and
that
they
were
very
intelligent
men
and
that
may
have
to
even
give
some
deference
to
their
opinion.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
if
it
did
they
didn't
catch
it.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
is
that
the
schiffman
or
askew
in
florida?
i
believe
so.
that
one
decision
and
the
iowa
decision
or
the
two
federal
decisions
which
are
against
us
and
i
believe
they
had
been
decided
at
the
time
and
we
would
urge
that
in
light
of
the
decision
in--
we
see
here
of
england
versus
louisiana
medical
examiners
in
1964
case
that
if
you're
going
to
apply
this
doctrine
to
1983
cases
that
you
at
least
accept
our
case
and
maybe
apply
it
to
future
cases
but
that
at
least
as
far
as
ours
is
concern
since
it
was
never
raised
at
the
lower
level,
that
we
not
be
barred
from
the
decision
by
the
court
at
this
time
and
that
if
the
injunction
is
not
to
be
granted,
at
least
to
the
declaratory
judgment
part
is
to
be
granted.
and
that
there
may
be
questions
as
far
as
committee
is
concerned
but
at
least
as
far
as
the
question
of
the
declaratory
judgment
part
of
it
that
the
court
rule
on
the
matter
since
the
states
have
barely
have
differed
to
the
question
at
least
the
state
of
iowa
has
and
that
there's
a
request
and
that
the
class
does
still
exist
that
the
--
its
my
understanding
that
the
question
about
name
party
or
party
in
interest
is
simply
because
the
fact
that
the
party
in
interest
will
in
fact
argue
the
constitutional
question
and
i
believe
that
we
have
done
that
and
that
the
fact
that
the
matter
may
have
become
moot
as
to
this
particular
named
party
that
the
other
members
of
the
class
still
exist
in
iowa.
and
for
--
of
course
information,
mrs.
sosna
is
back
in
island,
lives
in
green
island,
iowa
and
has
this
or
with
the
children
but
there
are
still
in
iowa
the
class
of
the
other
people
who
are
deprived
who
had
most
recently
moved
into
iowa
and
that
the
class
does
still
exist
and
there
is
still
a
case
in
controversy.
that
there
are
still
people
that
are
being
affected
by
the
in
their
civil
rights
by
the
state
court
action
in
the
--
under
1983
and
therefore
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
excuse
me?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
class
still
exists
and
we're
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
class
and
on
behalf
of
the
appellant
which
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
and
i
think
that
is
only
irrelevant
as
to
whether
or
not
her
--
as
far
as
the
issue
on
the
question
of
case
and
controversy
is
concerned,
it
is
only
relevant
as
far
as
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
adequately
represent
the
class'
interest
and
i
think
we
are,
i
think
we're
trying
to
argue
them
and
doing
i
hopefully
a
good
job.
and
that
the
fact
that
as
to
one
member
of
the
class
becomes
moot
whether
it's
the
named
one
or
any
other
members,
this
could
be
constantly
changing
group
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
in
fact
a
durational
period
and
people
are
moving
in
and
people
will
fall
out
of
the
class
but
the
class
will
continue
to
exist
no
matter
what
this
court
does.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
would
think
so
or
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
you
know
had
been
elected
official
and
had
somebody
else
had
taken
his
place
as
substitution.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
yes
that
the
class
still
exists.
thank
you.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
this
is
the
durational
--
durational
residency
requirement
case.
it
is
a
developing
area
of
the
law
that
the
court
is
aware.
we
are
raising
the
constitutional
question
of
the
iowa
durational
residency
requirement
for
access
to
the
domestic
courts
of
iowa.
it's
an
iowa
statute
requiring
one
year
residency
before
you
have
access
to
the
courts
basing
it
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
if
both
of
the
parties
moved
in
to
iowa
together,
then
it
does
not
apply,
it
only
if
one
of
the
parties
moves
in.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
other
party
is
not
a
resident.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
a
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
i
think
the
narrower
the
classification,
the
easier
it
is
to
argue
on
an
equal
protection
question
if
there's
no
rational
relationship
to
the
narrow
group
that
is
excluded
and
i
think
that
ours
because
it
is
a
more
narrow
restriction,
it's
probably
easier
to
argue
because
of
the
fact
that
it
applies
only
to
non-residence
where
there's
a
non-resident
out
of
the
state
other
party,
whereas
both
has
moved
into
the
state
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
even
for
a
week
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
for
some
reason,
the
state
feels
it
has
some
compelling
interest
over
parties
which
are
one
of
--
one
of
them
isn't
in
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
think
that's
probably
true
but
i
think
that's
probably
the
reason
for
there's
a
durational
residency
requirement
has
cause
divorce
mills
to
occur
and
i
think
that
striking
down
on
such
a
durational
residency
requirements
will
take
care
of
that
problem
and
that
the
states
can
litigate
the
proper
status
of
those
parties
in
the
state
where
the
real
interest
lies.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
i
think
that
in
the
instance
that
if
we
use
the
criterion
that
we
have
advocate
as
the
real
jurisdictional
question
once
the
court
has
said
in
the
past
to
be
the
jurisdictional
question
which
is
domicile
that
the
domicile
of
the
party
is
the
real
interest
to
which
the
state
has
and
the
fact
that
the
domicile
of
the
other
party
is
only
peripheral
to
the
interest
that
they
have
because
of
the
many
concomitant
things
that
go
with
the
marital
situations
such
as
a
severance,
such
as
a
custody,
support,
division
of
property
and
the
attend
and
other
things
that
go
with
it.
such
as
in
iowa,
we
have
requirement
of
reconciliation,
the
injunctions
that
would
be
necessary
or
proper
to
preserve
the
peace
or
property
and
these
things
we
feel
are
the
real
issue
and
that
the
citizen
has
in
the
divorce
court,
the
non-resident
or
a
resident
domiciliary
of
the
state
who
cannot
overcome
the
jurisdictional
one
year
requirement.
he
cannot
have
for
instance
a
--
the
severance
of
the
relationship
which
is
possible
to
a
non-resident
who
moves
in
with
his
spouse
and
then
the
other
spouse
would
for
instance
move
out
after
the
action
has
been
commenced.
if
there
is
a
severe
reason
for
an
immediate
severance,
we
don't
have
to
wait
the
90
days
that
are
normally
required
for
divorce
but
if
it
was
a
one
party
was
from
out
of
the
state,
it
had
wait
a
full
year
and
90
days
possibly
or
at
least
a
year
before
they
get
an
access
to
the
court.
the
custody
of
the
offspring
and
i
feel
this
is
very
important
and
why
many
times
access
to
the
court
is
quite
urgent
because
of
the
fact
that
the
ramifications
of
the
separate
families
if
we
don't
make
the
ties
cutoff
that
the
ramifications
and
the
effect
upon
children
and
the
offspring
of
the
marriage
can
be
affected
to
a
great
extent
and
that
therefore
you
should
be
able
to
get
in
at
least
as
far
as
the
parties
are
concerned
and
that
the
custody
questions
can
be
litigated
so
you
don't
have
this
situation,
the
parties
running
from
state
to
state
with
children
trying
to
get
the
other
state
to
give
them
custody
that
we
could
get
this
matters
litigated
and
that
the
offspring
could
be
better
protected
if
they
let
a
chance
to
get
to
the
court
and
the
support
of
those
persons,
the
division
of
the
properties
so
that
there
could
be
certain
injunctory
orders
entered
to
preserve
the
status
quo
so
that
disposition
of
the
properties
that
the
parties
that
they're
leaving
in
another
state,
don't
dispose
of
the
properties
or
do
something
with
them
so
that
when
it
comes
time
to
take
care
of
the
offspring
that
there
are
things
available.
for
instance,
there
are
statute
to
counseling,
there's
no
counseling.
the
state
of
iowa
has
maintained
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
one
year
residency
requirement
is
this
got
somehow
going
to
preserve
the
union
that
we
feel
that
however
immediate
access
to
the
courts
would
allow
the
order
for
some
type
of
word
of
counseling
which
may
be
more
beneficial
than
having
two
parties
in
opposite
--
in
separate
state
sitting
and
wondering
about
their
situation
for
a
year.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we
try
to
but
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we
presented
it
in
the
pleadings
and
the
fact
that
we
are
required
under
the
statute
in
question
to
plead
the
fact
of
one
year
residency
requirement
is
to
be
pled.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
claim
was
rejected
by
judge
keck
and
he
rejected
not
on
the
basis
that
he
passed
on
the
question
and
as
he
said
that
he
felt
he
was
in
the
position
to
pass
upon
the
constitutional
question
when
the
statute
upon
his
facing
to
be
quite
certain
and
that
he
didn't
want
to
go
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we'll,
because
of
the
status
of
the
case
is
at
the
time
it
appeared
that
only
preservation
under
a
situation
where
there
was
little
or
no
dispute
to
write
the
statute
itself
that
the
state
courts
have
been
very
reluctant
to
get
into
the
constitutional
issue.
they
would
always
avoid
it
has
been
the
habit
of
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we
could
present
it
to
him
again
and
reject
it
but
the
court
system
then
was
in
fact
depriving
the
--
under
1983
was
depriving
the
citizens
of
his
civil
rights
which
had
been
by
history
the
prerogative
or
had
been
the
place
that
had
been
litigated
was
in
the
federal
court
and
therefore
the
federal
court
would
be
their
proper
forum
to
litigate
this
one.
in
fact,
the
state
law
which
was
depriving
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
of
a
constitutional
right
was
being
deprived.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
was
raised
by
the
special
appearance
of
the
--
mr.
sosna
who
came
in
and
raised
the
special
appearance
and
then
it
was
litigated
not
by
us
but
by
them
because
the
question
had
been
raised
as
to
his
right
to
be
litigated.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
he
was
then
litigated
but
i
don't
like
term
litigate,
i
don't
feel
it
was
litigated.
we
tried
to
present
the
case
and
judge
keck
says,
that
he
was
not
--
did
not
want
make
pass
upon
that
and
he
didn't,
i
don't
think
he
ever
intended
to
make
a
judicial
decision
on
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
dismissed
it.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
he
didn't
decide
that
we
had
no
claim.
he
just
said
that
the
statute
says
that
you
cannot
have
access
to
our
courts
period.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
because
we're
going
back
in
the
federal
court
in
litigating
really
the
state
as
you
--
as
the
party,
the
original
party
was
mr.
sosna,
we
have
no
different
parties.
and
we're
talking
about
the
state,
the
state
under
color
of
law,
is
trying
to
deprive
us
of
a
constitutional
right,
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts
to
litigate
a
very
essential
and
necessary
right
to
which
is
that
of
a
marriage
relationship
and
all
of
the
concomitant
things
that
arise
from
it,
the
very
basic,
we
feel
very
basic
right.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
because
of
--
i
think
because
of
the
fact
of
the
status
of
the
law
at
the
time,
the
law
was
very
certain
they
put
to
the
question
of
durational
residency
requirement
had
been
struck
down
in
the
past
by
other
federal
courts
and
i
think
if
we
should
look
from
our
brief,
you
can
see
that
when
you
split
up
the
cases
between
those
that
have
sustained
the
durational
residency
requirement
and
those
that
have
struck
them
down,
it
has
been
almost
the
majority
of
the
state
courts
in
the
federal
court
however
is
always
vindicated
the
rights,
the
constitutional
rights
because
that
had
been
the
proper
forum.
and
that
when
it
was
a
very,
as
the
court
said,
a
very
certain
statute
on
its
face,
there
wasn't
any
way
normally
that
you
say,
okay
we're
going
to
litigate
it
further
in
the
state
court,
if
there's
any
chance
that
you
might
have
a
chance
of
changing
the
opinion
or
having
the
matter
at
least
under
1983
case
that
there
could
be
some
construction
of
the
statute
which
would
in
fact
give
you
a
vindication
of
those
rights
and
that
there
would
be
no
such
vindication
and
its
superfluous
to
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
--
require
them
to
proceed.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
that's
true
they
did.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
what
i
was
taking
was
as
a
lawyer
looking
at
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
i
think
that
it
has
been
historically
true
that
they
confine
the
decision
or
reason
more
compelling
which
would
justify
the
durational
residency
requirement.
we
feel
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
--
that
find
a
more
sufficient
reason
as
the
--
as
in
our
particular
case
two
of
the
three
federal
judges
found
that
the
interest
is
somehow
was
going
to
preserve,
that
this
was
somehow
going
to
preserve
the
marital
situation
and
that
if
you
look
at
the
decisions
which
have
sustained
the
state
court
decision
which
has
sustained
these
durational
residency
requirements,
they've
gone
from
filler
to
post
under
reasons
that
they
felt
that
somehow
was
going
to
sustain
these
--
for
some
reason
we're
going
to
help
the
marriage
or
we're
going
to
preserve
a
compelling
state
interest
which
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
durational
remedy
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
that
is
the
best
of
our
research,
it
hasn't.
the
iowa
court
spoken
(voice
overlap)
however
over,
over
again
in
the
past.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
i
suppose
you
just
have
to
as
a
lawyer.
look
at
what
the
history
has
been
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
the
history
of
state
court
decisions
in
regards
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
anyway
we
all
have
an
iowa
right.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
it's
unique
in
regards
to
durational
residency
requirement
but
i
don't
think
it
therefore
makes
it
anymore
easy
for
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
to
decide
it.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
because
of
the
fact
that
they
have
always
found
that
there
was
some
compelling
state
interest
which
we
have
felt
that
there
was
no
such
compelling
state
interest
and
that
the
federal
courts
whenever
were
presented
with
the
case
always
found
that
there
was
not
a
compelling
state
interest
that
the
history
of
the
federal
decisions
in
regards
to
marital
relationship
was
it
was
one
of
the
most
basic
of
the
relationships
and
therefore
that
to
deprive
someone
under
color
of
law
whether
by
a
court
or
some
jury,
some
residency
requirement
was
in
fact
one
of
the
very
basic
things
that
was
at
issue
and
that
therefore
the
line
of
cases
of
shapiro
in
welfare
cases,
and
dunn
in
the
voting
cases,
and
memorial
hospital
in
the
non-emergency
medical
care
that
these
were
all
the
same
type
of
situations.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
felt
more
favorable
atmosphere
because
of
the
fact
that
that
is
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
--
recently
been
the
forum
of
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
if
we
didn't
start
it
on
the
state
action,
we
would
be
on
a
rather
moot
position
to
go
on
and
say
that
we
would
like
to
have
a
divorce,
start
a
divorce
but
we
can't
because
of
the
residency
requirement.
if
you
don't
start
it
you
could
then
turn
on
and
say
well,
how
do
you
know
you
really
have
broken
marriage?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
think
there
is
a
--
sure
there's
a
declaratory
judgment
statute
but
the
question
was
whether
or
not
it's
really
at
issue
then.
is
it
a
justiciable
situation
or
controversy
if
you
have
in
fact
a
larger
divorce
action?
how
do
you
know
for
sure
that
you
really
have
a
divorce?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
there
is
a
separate
maintenance
statute
in
iowa.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
that
also
has
a
requirement.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
issue
of
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
don't
believe
it
was.
the
matter
solely
turned
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well
then,
the
criminal
part
of
it,
i've
--
you
know
as
an
old
prosecutor,
i
know
how
important
it
is
to
keep
your
prosecution
going
once
you've
got
the
machinery
going
and
that
therefore
that
interest
is
far
different
than
that
of
a
civil
litigation
where
you're
alleging
that
the
civil
litigation
and
the
judge
in
the
under
color
of
the
state
law
is
in
fact
depriving
a
citizen
of
his
basic
federal
constitutional
right
and
i
think
that's
quite
different
because
of
the
nature
of
the
criminal
process
which
is
different
than
the
civil
process
and
therefore
has
rises
above
and
maybe
is
a
more
compelling
state
interest
in
the
prosecution
of
criminals.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
on
res
judicata
as
to
issue
or
claim
or
as
to
parties
or
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
think
that
if
we
had
brought
the
case
against
iowa
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
--
as
against
to
mr.
sosna
i
think
we
could.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
don't
know
how
we
could
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action
against
another
party
to
the
marriage.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
i
--
but
the
marriage
situation
is
you're
certainly
litigating
the
marriage
situation
and
you
can't
get
a
declaratory
judgment
out
of
it.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
without
first
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right,
that's
a
1983
case.
we're
saying
that
the
state
by
enacting
a
statute
is
in
fact
depriving
us
of
our
constitutional
rights
that
we've
judge
--
we've
joined
judge
keck
in
it
because
the
fact
that
he
under
color
of
law
is
in
fact
depriving
us
of
a
basic
constitutional
right.
otherwise,
you
might
as
well
throw
1983
out
the
window
if
you're
going
to
say
that
if
you
bring
a
state
court
action
and
the
judges
use
the
state
court
law
and
to
deprive
you
of
your
constitutional
right,
you
can't
raise
the
declaratory
judgment
question
as
to
whether
or
not
that
state
law
is
in
fact
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
that
is
an
alternate
proceeding,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
we're
not
really
appealing
(voice
overlap)
to
the
federal
district
court,
we're
asking
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
because
what
we
are
litigating
--
we
started
out
for
a
divorce
action.
we
say
we
wanted
a
divorce.
we
wind
up
having
the
defense
being
frost
upon
us
that
the
fact
that
you
haven't
been
there
for
a
year
and
litigating
our
constitutional
rights
in
the
state
court.
now,
we
then
now
would
turn
around
to
the
federal
court
and
said
we
have
been
deprived
by
the
state
court
under
the
defense
of
no
jurisdiction
and
therefore
we
would
like
to
have
this
court
declare
and
enjoining
the
court
from
using
that
defense
and
to
throwing
us
out
of
court
so
we
can
have
access
to
the
state
court.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we
would
ask
for
an
injunction
against
the
maybe
mandamus
or
something
like
that
and
then
you're
into
--
i
mean
that
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
direct
appeal
to
the
iowa
supreme
court?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
yes,
we
could
have
appealed
that.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
we
went
and
ask
the
federal
court
to
declare
and
enjoin
the
state
court
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
the,
at
least
had
been
my
experience
with
three-judge
federal
panels
that
if
you've
got
a
civil
rights
that
are
being
deprived
under
color
of
law
by
a
state,
the
quickest
way
you
can
do
it
and
was
thought
to
be
that
by
the
constitution
--
by
the
congress
was
to
enact
1983
and
that
to
me
i
know
is
the
quickest
way
to
vindicate
your
rights
if
you're
being
abused
by
the
state.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
believe
so.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
she
has,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
he
could
probably
litigate
the
status
in
iowa
but
not
the
questions
of
personal
jurisdiction
as
to
none
iowa
in
rem
type
of
things.
i
mean
the
status
is
in
iowa
but
anything
else
is
still
in
new
york,
so,
yes,
you
can
probably
get
it
terminated
if
she's
willing
to
give
up
everything,
the
questions
would
delete
it.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
that's
the
whole
point,
you
have
to
wait
a
year
and
there
are
important
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
yes,
but
there
were
important
things
that,
the
laws
over
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
but
there
were
important
things
that
should
have
been
litigated
that
never
were,
for
instance
the
right
and
support
of
those
children
should
have
been
litigated
than
not
having
to
wait
a
year
or
well
maybe
mr.
sosna
might
take
up
other
relationship.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
pardon?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
it
can
be
done
now,
yes
but
the
question
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
declaratory
judgment,
declaratory
of
the
constitutional
right
of
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right,
as
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
this
particular
case
--
this
particular
plaintiff
in
the
class
action?
well,
as
for
this
particular
plaintiff,
her
situation
has
been
resolved
by
time
but
the
length
it
takes
to
litigate
the
matter
but
there
are
other
situations
which
is
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
what
doesn't
give
me
any
problem?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no
because
as
the
court
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
as
judge
stephenson
said
in
his
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
i
believe
not
but
at
least
the
class
was
acknowledged
and
never
challenged
by
anyone
up
to
this
point.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
but
we
had
plenty
of
calls
about
people
that
wanted
to.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
believe
that
there
is
a
president
for
the
class,
we
have
nothing
else
as
to
remand
it
to
the
court
again
and
let
other
members
of
the
class
join
in
if
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
think
it
was
the
babcock
versus
wilson,
i
don't
have
the
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
she
herself?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
not
as
far
as
the
iowa
court
is.
she
in
fact
has
gone
and
got
a
divorce
and
had
to
go
back
and
litigate
the
matter,
take
a
bus
back
to
new
york
and
had
a
litigator
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
yes,
in
fact
in
new
york.
she
had
to
go
back
to
new
york
in
litigation
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
that's
a
good
question.
cooper
versus
cooper
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
well,
cooper
versus
cooper
raises
the
question
which
is
an
iowa
decision
about
a
doctor
from
iowa
that
went
out
to
nevada
and
get
a
nevada
divorce
and
the
iowa
court
says
we
can
still
--
our
support
judgments
and
personal
judgments
in
regards
to
support.
so
far
there's
nobody
going
to
stand
who
will
acknowledge
the
divorce
in
nevada.
now,
under
iowa
law,
i
have
to
question
as
to
whether
or
not
she
can
get
a
new
york
divorce
and
might
have
a
different
question
as
why
is
the
state
of
iowa
under
the
present
status
of
iowa
law
in
19
--
i
believe
in
19
cooper
versus
cooper
was
a
74
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
pardon?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
now,
it's
the
grade
of
the
divorce
and
the
court
there,
i
mean,
used
their
powers
of
determining
domicile
of
the
doctor
who
left
on
october
and
went
to
nevada,
got
his
divorce
and
came
back
in
january
and
they
went
through
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
domicile
or
not
and
they
said
yes
it
was
domicile
in
nevada
sufficient
for
the
nevada
court
to
have
jurisdiction
or
grant
--
acknowledges
divorce
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
that
she
herself,
no,
but
the
class
to
which
she
is
member
i
think
still
can
because
i
think
that
as
the
state
has
admitted
in
their
stipulation
of
facts
that
it
is
a
group
so
and
its
so
numerous
that
--
were
numerous
than
has
able
to
be
counted
and
i
think
that
there
are
numbers
and
numbers
of
people
who
have
marital
relations
which
are
at
question
and
needed
access
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
no,
i
would
--
at
this
present
status,
yes
she
would
not
be
but
the
class
itself
and
i
would
urge
that
if
the
court
was
to
adopt
the
question
that
they
would
send
it
back
so
that
other
members
of
the
class
who
would
be
members
would
in
fact
be
able
to
join
in
the
matter
and
to
bring
the
matter
back
before
the
court.
i'd
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
possible?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
suppose
they
can
but
as
we've
indicated
that
it's
a
matter
of
urgency
and
a
necessity
and
that's
the
basic
question
about
the
marital
relation,
its
not
a
matter
of
waiting
a
year
because
by
that
time
the
damages
are
done
as
to
the
children,
the
property,
the
relationship
itself
has
deteriorated
and
that
these
are
matters
of
that
need
work
instanter,
that
in
a
year,
that's
the
whole
projection
of
the
question.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
i
believe
i
do
have
that
case
of
babcock
--
cox
versus
babcock
and
wilson
471
f.2d
13,
page
15
in
which
they
did
refer
the
case
back
to
the
court
--
to
the
lower
court
where
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
right.
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
at
first
boddie
versus
connecticut
which
is
the
other
similar
case
to
this
in
which
the
was
divorce
was
terminated
or
was
never
started
was
because
of
the
fact
of
or
was
allowed
to
proceed
was
because
of
the
failing
to
pay
the
fee
which
is
similar
to
the
situation
here,
and
it
was
never
raised
by
this
court
when
they
determined
boddie
versus
connecticut
that
kind
of
catches
us
here
after
the
jurisdictional
statement
and
the
matters
already
been
litigated
with
the
whole
new
case
when
we
come
up
before
the
court
that
the
whole
thrust
of
our
argument
and
that
the
argument
now
is
that
somehow
that
federalism
or
committee
or
judicial
husbandry
is
going
to
be
affected
by
you
not
making
a
decision
on
this
matter
is
not
the
case
when
you
look
at
the
fact
that
there
seven
or
eight
state
courts
decisions
all
one
way
and
the
federal
court
decisions
are
the
other
way
with
two
of
the
most
recent
ones,
alaska
and
i
believe
massachusetts
finally
going
--
coming
our
way
and
in
fact
the
fiorentino
case
in
massachusetts
even
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
court
had
made
a
three-judge
federal
panel
had
made
a
decision
and
that
they
were
very
intelligent
men
and
that
may
have
to
even
give
some
deference
to
their
opinion.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
if
it
did
they
didn't
catch
it.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
is
that
the
schiffman
or
askew
in
florida?
i
believe
so.
that
one
decision
and
the
iowa
decision
or
the
two
federal
decisions
which
are
against
us
and
i
believe
they
had
been
decided
at
the
time
and
we
would
urge
that
in
light
of
the
decision
in--
we
see
here
of
england
versus
louisiana
medical
examiners
in
1964
case
that
if
you're
going
to
apply
this
doctrine
to
1983
cases
that
you
at
least
accept
our
case
and
maybe
apply
it
to
future
cases
but
that
at
least
as
far
as
ours
is
concern
since
it
was
never
raised
at
the
lower
level,
that
we
not
be
barred
from
the
decision
by
the
court
at
this
time
and
that
if
the
injunction
is
not
to
be
granted,
at
least
to
the
declaratory
judgment
part
is
to
be
granted.
and
that
there
may
be
questions
as
far
as
committee
is
concerned
but
at
least
as
far
as
the
question
of
the
declaratory
judgment
part
of
it
that
the
court
rule
on
the
matter
since
the
states
have
barely
have
differed
to
the
question
at
least
the
state
of
iowa
has
and
that
there's
a
request
and
that
the
class
does
still
exist
that
the
--
its
my
understanding
that
the
question
about
name
party
or
party
in
interest
is
simply
because
the
fact
that
the
party
in
interest
will
in
fact
argue
the
constitutional
question
and
i
believe
that
we
have
done
that
and
that
the
fact
that
the
matter
may
have
become
moot
as
to
this
particular
named
party
that
the
other
members
of
the
class
still
exist
in
iowa.
and
for
--
of
course
information,
mrs.
sosna
is
back
in
island,
lives
in
green
island,
iowa
and
has
this
or
with
the
children
but
there
are
still
in
iowa
the
class
of
the
other
people
who
are
deprived
who
had
most
recently
moved
into
iowa
and
that
the
class
does
still
exist
and
there
is
still
a
case
in
controversy.
that
there
are
still
people
that
are
being
affected
by
the
in
their
civil
rights
by
the
state
court
action
in
the
--
under
1983
and
therefore
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
excuse
me?
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
the
class
still
exists
and
we're
arguing
on
behalf
of
the
class
and
on
behalf
of
the
appellant
which
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
and
i
think
that
is
only
irrelevant
as
to
whether
or
not
her
--
as
far
as
the
issue
on
the
question
of
case
and
controversy
is
concerned,
it
is
only
relevant
as
far
as
whether
or
not
we're
going
to
adequately
represent
the
class'
interest
and
i
think
we
are,
i
think
we're
trying
to
argue
them
and
doing
i
hopefully
a
good
job.
and
that
the
fact
that
as
to
one
member
of
the
class
becomes
moot
whether
it's
the
named
one
or
any
other
members,
this
could
be
constantly
changing
group
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
in
fact
a
durational
period
and
people
are
moving
in
and
people
will
fall
out
of
the
class
but
the
class
will
continue
to
exist
no
matter
what
this
court
does.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
i
would
think
so
or
--
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
you
know
had
been
elected
official
and
had
somebody
else
had
taken
his
place
as
substitution.
mr.
james
h.
reynolds
yes
that
the
class
still
exists.
thank
you.
