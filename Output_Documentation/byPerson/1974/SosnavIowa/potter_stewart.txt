justice
potter
stewart
ms.
nolan,
has
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
in
any
other
case
dealt
with
the
constitutional
validity
of
this
statute?
i
think
mr.
reynolds
was
asked
that
question
but
i
didn't
get
any
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
supreme
court
applied
the
statute,
you
don't
know
if
it's
the
validity
of
the
statute
itself
was
attacked
on
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
court
applied
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
don't
--
do
you
know
whether
or
not
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
statute
was
attacked
in
that
case?
does
it
appear
from
the
opinion
or
for
anything
else?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
the
facts
were
litigated
i
guess
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
were
an
issue
in
that
case
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
has
the
statute
been
on
the
book?
you
said
that
iowa
has
recently
been
on
the
process
of
changing
its
divorce
law,
domestic
relations
law?
our
dissolution
statute
was
enacted
in
1970
and
it
has
reenacted
this
particular
provision
for
the
protection
of
the
absent
spouse
so
that
due
process
will
be
accorded
which
was
in
the
law
previously
and
i
don't
know
how
far
back
that
it
goes,
it
appears
to
go
back
at
least
into
the
50s
and
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
research
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you
were
the
defendant?
justice
potter
stewart
you
didn't
go
to
another
court?
justice
potter
stewart
not
so
very
long
ago
as
time
goes,
the
prevailing
law
was
that
a
wife
could
not
acquire
a
separate
domicile,
that
was
the
prevailing
domestic
relations
law
would
be
that
the
marital
domicile
was
the
husband's
domicile,
and
that
so
long
as
there
was
a
marriage
between
the
two,
the
wife
was
incapable
of
acquiring
a
separate
domicile
anywhere.
do
you
know
of
any
states
still
have
that
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
say
the
rule
that
i
just
summarized
used
to
be
the
prevailing
rule
in
domestic
relations
law,
you
don't
know
of
that.

it
really
isn't
younger
is
it?
there
was
no
pending
--
there
was
no
pending
litigation
in
the
state
courts.
the
state
trial
court
had
decided
the
case,
it
had
not
been
appealed,
the
time
for
appeal
had
expired,
there
was
nothing
pending
in
the
state
court,
it's
not
of
the
younger
case.
even
assuming
younger
applies
to
civil
litigation?
