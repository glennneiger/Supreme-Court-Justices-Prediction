justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
the
question
is
that
arguably
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
younger
against
harris
kind
of
approach
to
a
pending
criminal
case
when
one
seeks
to
go
to
a
federal
court,
it
should
be
applied
with
civil
proceedings
depending
on
the
state
you're
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
you
have,
at
least
after
this
trial
court
judgment
which
you
did
appeal,
if
you
have
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
action
against
the
same
--
against
the
other
party
to
this
marriage
in
a
state
court
of
iowa
seeking
they
have
a
statute
declared
unconstitutional,
you
--
and
the
defense
of
res
judicata
had
been
raised
than
you
did
not
sustain
under
iowa
law
or
any
other
law,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
with
the
same
parties,
same
--
it
was
same
parties
here.
you
could
have
brought
another
declaratory
judgment
action
or
on
other
decrees
in
litigation
in
the
iowa
court
without
facing
res
judicata
claims,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
talking
about
the
other
party
to
the
marriage?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
especially
after
it
has
already
been
--
your
claim
has
already
been
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
action
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
claim
had
already
been
decided
in
your
divorce
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
think
the
real
thing
that
save
you
is
that
you
were
litigating
with
iowa
rather
than
with
the
other
party
to
a
divorce
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
appeal
it
and
then
you
can
file
for
certiorari.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
you
argue
in
any
event
collateral
estoppel
based
on
the
conclusion
of
the
proceeding
before
judge
keck
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
what
i
was
getting
at
ms.
nolan
was
whether
you
relied
on
that
conclusion
of
judge
keck's
disposing
adversely
to
this
petitioner?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
the
constitutional
question
whether
you
relied
on
that
as
collateral
estoppel
in
this
federal
court
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
won
below
and
you
want
to
hang
out
to
that?
we'd
be
happy
with
that
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
nolan,
do
you
know
when
the
divorce
took
place?
justice
byron
r.
white
since
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction?
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
federal
court
had
sustained
the
statute
against
the
federal
claim
the
one
constitutional
by
litigant?
who
just
like
to
deal
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
suggestion
is
that
if
there's
a
pending
statement
in
which
the
issue
may
litigate,
that
it
should
be
reserved
to
the
state
courts
than
brought
here.
now
–-
but
the
younger
used
in
court
based
on
some
notion
of
protected
state
interest
expressly
copied
the
state
court
system.
and
if
the
state
doesn't
want
it,
(inaudible)
then
you
have
will
have
to
plead
the
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
which
is
normally
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
could
have
hanged
under
your
younger?
justice
byron

you

that
circuit
go
against
your
reasoning?
