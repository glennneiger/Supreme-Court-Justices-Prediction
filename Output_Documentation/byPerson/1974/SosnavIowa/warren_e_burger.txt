chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
sosna
against
iowa.
mr.
reynolds,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
an
obvious
background,
the
divorce
mill
state
problems
that
we
had
for
a
number
of
years
when
there
were
only
about
three
states,
florida,
nevada
i
guess?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn't
there
quite
a
difference?
isn't
the
state
different
--
quite
different
when
both
the
husband
and
the
wife
come
into
the
state
and
are
subject
to
its
jurisdiction
giving
the
indications
that
they're
going
to
make
up
the
family
home
as
distinguished
from
your
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
they,
who
do
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
which
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
have
a
unique
statute
in
iowa
you
indicated
to
justice
blackmun?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then,
how
are
the
actions
of
other
state
courts
with
different
statutes
relevant
to
this
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
brings
up
another
related
matter.
your
client
has
now
been
a
resident
and
viable
for
much
more
than
a
year,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
now
she
satisfies
the
requirement,
does
she?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
she
get
jurisdiction
of
the
husband,
the
defendant
by
publication?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
ms.
nolan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
raise
your
voice
a
lit
bit
ms.
nolan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
all
of
our
questions
were
directed
to
their
right
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
at
that
time,
not
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
is
your
answer
to
justice
marshall
that
the
state
of
iowa
is
perfectly
willing
to
bypass
the
state
supreme
court
and
go
into
federal
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
what
is
the
case
or
controversy
between
these
two
party
--
between
the
husband
and
the
wife?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
between
the
husband
rather
the
wife
and
the
state
of
iowa?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
today,
right
this
minute
at
quarter
to
11,
what
controversy
exists
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
any
of
the
parties
in
iowa,
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
not
very
clear
whether
the
state
of
iowa
is
urging
or
not
urging
federal
jurisdiction
here,
you
lose
me
in
a
state
of
confusion
on
it?
the
state
of
iowa's
position
on
the
federal
jurisdiction
question
is
that
the
state,
that
the
united
state
statutes
appear
to
give
to
the
federal
courts
the
power
under
the
civil
rights
law
to
determine
questions
of
violations
of
constitutionally
protected
rights
of
individuals
where
the
violations
occur
under
color
of
state
law
and
this
is
the
way
this
case
was
originated
and
this
is
the
way
this
case
was
argued
in
the
lower
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
it
was
last
term
in
the
burney
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
we
have
a
special
request
that
the
parties
addressed
themselves
to
the
younger
versus
harris
problem,
it
was
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
reynolds,
you
have
two
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
