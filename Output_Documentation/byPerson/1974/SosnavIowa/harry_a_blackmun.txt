mr.
reynolds,
is
that
precisely
true
with
the
--
straighten
me
out
because
i
have
a
misapprehension
here
perhaps.
does
the
one
year
residential
durational
requirement
apply
if
the
defendant
is
also
a
resident
of
iowa?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
then
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
rather
unusual
as
compared
to
most
statutes,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
the
statute
be
easier
--
be
harder
for
you
to
attack
if
it
applied
across
the
board
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
to
a
situation
where
a
defendant
was
a
resident?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
for
a
week?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
actual
residence
even
for
as
long
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
only
as
long
as
a
week?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
did
present
these
questions
to
the
ohio
likely
the
iowa
court,
i
get
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
did
you
present
then
in
your
pleadings?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
--
and
it
was
rejected,
your
claim
was
rejected?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
he
didn't
want
to
believe,
rejected
your
claim
you
presented
before,
why
didn't
you
appeal
to
that
--
in
the
iowa
court,
carried
the
constitutional
issue
to
the
iowa
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
presented
to
him
and
they
can
reject
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
talk
that
in
your
pleadings
in
the
state
court,
you
challenged
the
constitutionality
presented?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
was
then
litigated?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
here
was
a
pending
case
stated
in
the
state
and
state
court
system,
it
wasn't
by
law.
i
mean
you
have
appellate
opportunity,
it's
very
constitutional
question
through
the
state
court
system.
why
should
a
federal
court
get
into
and
defend
for
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
felt
there
was
a
more
favorable
atmosphere
for
your
cause
in
the
federal
side?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know
why
but
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
on
the
other
hand,
you
started
your
action
on
the
state
side
and
chose
not
to
appeal?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn't
there
a
federal
declaratory
judgment
on
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
a
separate
maintenance
statute
in
iowa?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
chose
not
to
follow
that
one
either?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
ms.
nolan,
(voice

why
you
pleaded,
the
younger
from
that
provision
has
paragraph
(d)
that
i
read?
you've
abandoned
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
abandoned
it
below
and
you
abandon
it
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
justice
white
said
as
in
fact
doctrine
that
protects
state
interest
of
the
state
doesn't
want
to
be
protected,
i
guess
we
don't
apply
the

you

not
better?
