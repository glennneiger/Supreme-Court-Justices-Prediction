rehnquist
what
did
he
do
to
your
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
certainly
he
decides
that
you
have
no
claim,
doesn't
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
aren't
you
bound
by
that
under
law
res
judicata?
why
are
you
free
to
go
into
federal
court
and
re-litigate
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
set
up
several
occasions
mr.
reynolds
that
a
person
can't
represent
a
class
of
which
he's
not
a
member
and
i
think
that
would
probably
be
true
of
your
client
now
whatever
the
class
might
be
of
people
awaiting
iowa
divorce
requirement,
your
client
certainly
is
no
longer
a
member
of
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
iowa
statute
basically
the
uniform
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
--
why
didn't
you
plead
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
from
the
point
of
view
the
state,
isn't
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
just
as
good
as
source
of
certainty
as
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
federal
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
right,
you
weren't
able
to
go?
justice
william
h.

if
the
class
may
exist

she's
not

justice
william

rehnquist
in
sosna,
the
state
of
iowa
enacted
a
statute
under
which
only
persons
who
have
resided
in
the
state
for
one
year
may
file
a
petition
for
divorce
in
iowa's
courts.
appellant
sosna
who
had
resided
in
iowa
for
only
a
month
unsuccessfully
sought
to
obtain
a
divorce
in
the
iowa
state
court
and
thereafter
she
filed
a
class
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
iowa
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
the
iowa
residency
requirement
for
divorce.
a
three-judge
district
court
was
convened
and
upheld
this
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
and
by
the
time
we
heard
oral
argument,
appellant
sosna
had
resided
in
iowa
for
the
requisite
one
year
period.
and
we
were
informed
by
counsel
that
she
had
also
obtained
a
divorce
in
another
state.
but
since
appellant
sosna
brought
a
properly
certified
class
action,
we
hold
the
case
is
not
moot.
while
her
dispute
has
been
resolved,
she
represents
a
class
with
a
continuing
controversy
that
would
escape
review
by
any
single
challenger.
we
are
satisfied
that
appellant
adequately
represents
the
members
of
the
class
and
at
the
merits
of
her
case
are
therefore
properly
before
us.
on
the
merits
we
hold
that
the
iowa
statute
is
constitutional.
it
furthers
the
state's
quite
legitimate
interest
in
protecting
its
decrees
against
collateral
attack
and
assures
that
those
persons
seeking
to
invoke
the
powers
of
the
state
courts
have
a
reasonable
attachment
to
the
state.
we
therefore
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
joined
by
mr.
justice
brennan
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
