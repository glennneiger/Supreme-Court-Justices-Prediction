ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
iowa
to
urge
the
affirmance
of
the
court
below.
the
federal
district
court
there
did
take
on
this
civil
rights
action
and
as
its
opinion
clearly
states
it
was
convinced
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
yes
certainly.
it
was
convinced
that
the
compelling
interest
test
had
been
satisfied
and
that
the
state
of
iowa
did
meet
all
of
the
requirements
that
have
been
set
a
standards
in
the
recent
cases
determining
whether
or
not
when
a
person
is
newly
arrived
in
the
state
it
has
access
to
its
courts
and
access
to
its
order
--
rights
given
to
citizens.
the
matter
below
was
at
one
time
pled
with
a
view
toward
the
abstention
doctrine.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
we
didn't
--
i
did
not
take
part
in
the
hearings
below
but
its
my
understanding
it
was
not
argued
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
the
research
was
done
on
the
cases
and
the
various
standards
that
might
come
into
play,
it
was
decided
that
abstention
was
probably
not
the
proper
thing
in
this
particular
case
that
the
state
could
meet
its
burden
that
it
would
be
of
some
value
in
this
area
to
have
a
federal
court
ruling
on
the
case
being
litigated.
in
this
connection,
mr.
justice
white,
you
asked
if
there
was
a
reason
for
the
federal
court
to
come
in
and
hear
cases
of
this
nature
when
its
is
perfectly
possible
for
the
state
courts
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
their
own
statute
and
i
can
only
say
to
that
that
it
appears
to
be
a
current
practice
and
that
the
name
of
one
case
i
can't
pronounce
but
it's
a
hawaiian
case,
its
been
decided
since
whitehead
versus
whitehead
and
in
that
instance,
both
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts
have
looked
at
this
very
same
question,
and
so
for
that
reason
we
abandoned
our
position
of
abstention
in
this
case.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
no,
i
don't
believe
that
was
argued
as
a
matter
of
collateral
estoppel.
judge
keck's
decision
there
was
one
which
we
believe
was
thoroughly
grounded
in
a
lie.
it
was
a
well-reasoned
decision
and
that
thereto
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
federal
constitutional
protections
for
the
rights
of
individuals
had
been
met.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
to
this
plaintiff?
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
well,
i
would
say
that
(voice
overlap)
representing
judge
keck
in
his
position
that
he
had
acted
under
color
of
state
law,
yes,
i
guess
we
did.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
don't
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
here
however,
as
statement
was
made
just
previously
to
my
arising
and
that
is
that
the
plaintiffs
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
in
this
matter.
actually
their
time
for
appeal
has
expired,
i
don't
that
is
any
longer
available
to
them.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
at
that
time,
yes
sir,
i
think
they
did
certainly
have
that
right.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
the
state
of
iowa
since
in
the
last
10
years
has
done
a
great
deal
to
liberalize
its
divorce
laws.
we
also
would
like
to
know
where
we
stand.
we
believe
that
our
supreme
court
would
affirm
judge
keck's
decision
in
this
particular
case.
we
don't
have
any
reason
to
appeal
that
decision.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
chose
to
abandon
their
appeal
why
--
and
they
bring
their
action
in
another
forum
or
we
did
come
to
that
forum
with
the
hope
that
this
might
serve
some
benefit
both
in
the
state
of
iowa
and
in
general
in
resolving
these
particular
requirements
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights.
this
court
is
well
aware
that
since
pennoyer
versus
neff
and
the
williams
versus
north
carolina,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
controversy
about
divorce
actions
and
when
the
iowa
legislature
in
the
--
starting
about
1967
undertook
a
study
of
the
divorce
laws
with
the
purpose
of
reforming
them
in
the
state
of
iowa.
they
were
well
aware
of
the
conference
work
on
the
uniform
divorce
act
and
also
they
were
aware
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
particularly
estin
versus
estin
and
the
vanderbilt
versus
vanderbilt
cases
which
talked
in
terms
of
divisible
divorce
and
accommodation
of
the
parties
and
all
of
this
matters
and
it
was
for
this
purpose
that
we
abandon
our
abstention
doctrine
in
the
lower
court
and
attempted
to
meet
what
the
fifth
circuit
now
has
seemingly
in
the
makres
versus
askew
case
coming
florida.
what
seems
to
be
a
unitary
standard
showing
compelling
interest
and
overwriting
significance
in
all
matters
whether
they
arise
from
due
process
or
from
some
other
incident
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
in
the
case
of
iowa,
we
feel
that
our
statute
is
tailored
to
minimize
overbreadth
by
applying
the
durational
residency
rules
only
in
those
cases
where
the
respondent
is
not
a
resident
and
cannot
be
served
personally
in
the
state
and
for
this
reason
we
feel
that
we
have
in
reenacting
a
requirement
that
has
long
been
on
the
books
of
iowa
help
to
formulate
a
valuable
standard
and
we
have
them
pointed
out
in
the
uniform
marriage
and
divorce
act
as
being
one
of
the
original
states
to
take
part
in
this
kind
of
uniformity
in
this
area
of
the
law
and
for
this
reason,
the
federal
district
court
action
was
argued
by
the
state.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
well,
in
judge
keck's
decision
which
is
sent
out
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
there's
a
reference
to
korsrud
versus
korsrud
that's
in
242
iowa
i
believe
and
45
n.w.2d,
i
think
it
is.
in
any
event,
that
case
involved
a
petitioner
who
originally
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
iowa.
he
took
up
residence
in
hawaii
and
attempted
to
obtain
a
divorce
there.
then
he
came
back
to
the
state
of
iowa
on
being
advised
at
hawaii
that
iowa
is
the
proper
place
to
bring
his
action
and
obtained
a
divorce
without
informing
his
spouse
who
later
came
back
and
contested
the
validity
of
that
divorce
on
the
basis
that
the
court
had
not
had
jurisdictional
--
the
fact
of
jurisdictional
basis
for
giving
the
divorce
and
that
order
was
invalidated
and
we
find
this
in
our
own
--
from
our
own
experience
in
iowa.
so
it
is
possible
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
the
supreme
court
did
test
the
validity
of
that
statute
at
that
time
and
held
that
there
was
a
sham
domicile
pled
and
that
it
was
a
victim
of
fraud
and
that
the
court
was
a
victim
of
fraud.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
and
the
court
applied
the
statute,
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
in
my
recollection,
it
was
attacked
only
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
court
had
jurisdiction
but
i
think
that
is
essential
to
the
constitutional
validity
of
that
particular
section
of
the
code.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
right.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
right.
i
think
it
should
be
mentioned
here
also
that
in
the
district
court,
this
petitioner
came
in
and
the
court
found
that
not
only
did
the
petitioner
failed
to
alleged
the
one
year
residence
which
is
mandatory
under
the
circumstances
of
that
particular
action
but
that
also
the
plaintiff
failed
to
plead
that
her
residence
in
the
state
had
been
in
good
faith
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
marriage
dissolution.
this
is
not
an
issue
in
this
particular
case
but
both
of
these
requirements
are
mandatory
under
the
iowa
dissolution
of
marriage
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
well,
i
would
say
that
as
close
as
uniform
laws
are
uniform,
iowa
statute
is
the
uniform
law,
yes.
it
contains
requirements
that
there
be
an
allegation
of
a
breakdown
of
the
marriage
relationship.
this
is
also
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
were
interested
in
pursuing
this
in
the
federal
court
because
we
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
determine
that
the
state
of
iowa
did
have
jurisdiction
over
the
marital
status.
in
this
particular
instance,
it
appears
from
the
allegations
in
the
federal
action
that
the
plaintiff
and
from
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
also
that
the
plaintiff's
marital
relationship
with
her
husband
had
broken
down
somewhere
outside
the
state
of
iowa
and
some
several
months
prior
to
her
relocation
in
the
state
of
iowa.
so,
it
may
and
we
felt
it
was
questionable
as
to
whether
or
not
there
actually
was
a
jurisdiction
over
the
marital
status
in
the
state
of
iowa
although
one
of
the
parties
alleged
to
be
domiciled
there.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
believe
it
was
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
in
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
there
were
interrogatories
propounded
and
answered
in
the
federal
court
action
and
i
believe
this
information
is
contained
clearly
in
the
answers
of
the
individual
counsel.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
we
appeared
in
that
action
as
defendants.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
we
would
be
happy
if
the
court
would
put
a
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
--
stamp
of
approval
on
our
state
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
pardon
me?
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
the
action
that
was
brought
was
for
a
declaratory
action
for
declaratory
judgment.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
would
say
yes
that
that
is
true.
the
state
of
iowa
had
no
con
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
don't
know,
i
don't
think
that's
been
the
rule
in
iowa
for
sometime
because
our
statutes
do
permit
the
court
to
take
jurisdiction
if
one
of
the
parties
is
domicile.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
have
no
knowledge
of
other
states
in
that
particular
regard.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
well,
my
position
on
this
question
before
this
court
is
that
there
appears
to
have
been
a
proper
appeal
from
a
district
court
order
and
that
this
court
does
have
authority
and
power
to
affirm
that
lower
court
decision
which
is
what
we
asked.
with
respect
to
the
class
action
as
such,
i
think
that
that
entire
matter
has
now
been
made
moot.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
think
so
but
i
think
that
the
appeal
is
preserved
or
was
properly
preserved.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
believe
so.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
well,
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
the
controversy
was
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
what
is
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
feel
that
the
petitioner
in
the
original
action
although
now
divorced
and
i
assume
removed
from
the
state
of
iowa
would
have
only
the
controversy
grounds
that
existed
at
the
time
that
the
action
was
originally
brought
and
that
is
to
have
the
question
determined
under
the
civil
rights
sections
of
the
code
and
then
to
pursue
any
decision
through
appeal
to
the
highest
court
in
the
land.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
are
you
referring
to
the
divisible
divorce
here?
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
thank
you,
i
appreciate
it.
i
don't
have
the
answer
really
to
the
question.
i
assume
that
this
appeal
was
brought
in
good
faith
and
that
the
court
took
jurisdiction
of
it
in
good
faith.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
pardon
me?
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
do
not
know.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
as
of
this
morning
it
sounds
like
they
aren't
other
than
judge
keck
and
the
state
of
iowa.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
have
not
brief
that
and
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
no
i'm
not.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i'm
not
but
in
all
of
this
time
no
other
party
has
come
forth
to
join
this
class.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
don't
ask
you
to
do
that.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
when
the
divorce
took
place?
i
didn't
hear
about
it
until
this
morning,
evidently
it
has
taken
place
in
new
york
state.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
in
younger
versus
harris,
had
the
--
we
would
contend
that
had
the
court
or
had
they
pursue
this
appeal
to
the
state
court,
that
younger
versus
harris
would
be
applicable
here
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
seems
to
be
an
overriding
interest
in
getting
some
kind
of
certainty
append
to
these
types
of
jurisdictional
questions
and
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
correct
we
did
not.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
we
did
abandon
it
below.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
it
is
but
we
did
not
have
the
opportunity
of
taking
this
case
to
the
iowa
supreme
court.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
right.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
the
case
is
moot
but
in
order
to
present
the
other
side
of
this
argument
before
this
court
we
appear.
thank
you.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
on
behalf
of
the
state
of
iowa
to
urge
the
affirmance
of
the
court
below.
the
federal
district
court
there
did
take
on
this
civil
rights
action
and
as
its
opinion
clearly
states
it
was
convinced
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
yes
certainly.
it
was
convinced
that
the
compelling
interest
test
had
been
satisfied
and
that
the
state
of
iowa
did
meet
all
of
the
requirements
that
have
been
set
a
standards
in
the
recent
cases
determining
whether
or
not
when
a
person
is
newly
arrived
in
the
state
it
has
access
to
its
courts
and
access
to
its
order
--
rights
given
to
citizens.
the
matter
below
was
at
one
time
pled
with
a
view
toward
the
abstention
doctrine.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
we
didn't
--
i
did
not
take
part
in
the
hearings
below
but
its
my
understanding
it
was
not
argued
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
the
research
was
done
on
the
cases
and
the
various
standards
that
might
come
into
play,
it
was
decided
that
abstention
was
probably
not
the
proper
thing
in
this
particular
case
that
the
state
could
meet
its
burden
that
it
would
be
of
some
value
in
this
area
to
have
a
federal
court
ruling
on
the
case
being
litigated.
in
this
connection,
mr.
justice
white,
you
asked
if
there
was
a
reason
for
the
federal
court
to
come
in
and
hear
cases
of
this
nature
when
its
is
perfectly
possible
for
the
state
courts
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
their
own
statute
and
i
can
only
say
to
that
that
it
appears
to
be
a
current
practice
and
that
the
name
of
one
case
i
can't
pronounce
but
it's
a
hawaiian
case,
its
been
decided
since
whitehead
versus
whitehead
and
in
that
instance,
both
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts
have
looked
at
this
very
same
question,
and
so
for
that
reason
we
abandoned
our
position
of
abstention
in
this
case.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
no,
i
don't
believe
that
was
argued
as
a
matter
of
collateral
estoppel.
judge
keck's
decision
there
was
one
which
we
believe
was
thoroughly
grounded
in
a
lie.
it
was
a
well-reasoned
decision
and
that
thereto
all
of
the
requirements
of
the
federal
constitutional
protections
for
the
rights
of
individuals
had
been
met.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
to
this
plaintiff?
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
well,
i
would
say
that
(voice
overlap)
representing
judge
keck
in
his
position
that
he
had
acted
under
color
of
state
law,
yes,
i
guess
we
did.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
don't
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
here
however,
as
statement
was
made
just
previously
to
my
arising
and
that
is
that
the
plaintiffs
have
the
right
to
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
in
this
matter.
actually
their
time
for
appeal
has
expired,
i
don't
that
is
any
longer
available
to
them.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
at
that
time,
yes
sir,
i
think
they
did
certainly
have
that
right.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
the
state
of
iowa
since
in
the
last
10
years
has
done
a
great
deal
to
liberalize
its
divorce
laws.
we
also
would
like
to
know
where
we
stand.
we
believe
that
our
supreme
court
would
affirm
judge
keck's
decision
in
this
particular
case.
we
don't
have
any
reason
to
appeal
that
decision.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
chose
to
abandon
their
appeal
why
--
and
they
bring
their
action
in
another
forum
or
we
did
come
to
that
forum
with
the
hope
that
this
might
serve
some
benefit
both
in
the
state
of
iowa
and
in
general
in
resolving
these
particular
requirements
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights.
this
court
is
well
aware
that
since
pennoyer
versus
neff
and
the
williams
versus
north
carolina,
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
controversy
about
divorce
actions
and
when
the
iowa
legislature
in
the
--
starting
about
1967
undertook
a
study
of
the
divorce
laws
with
the
purpose
of
reforming
them
in
the
state
of
iowa.
they
were
well
aware
of
the
conference
work
on
the
uniform
divorce
act
and
also
they
were
aware
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
particularly
estin
versus
estin
and
the
vanderbilt
versus
vanderbilt
cases
which
talked
in
terms
of
divisible
divorce
and
accommodation
of
the
parties
and
all
of
this
matters
and
it
was
for
this
purpose
that
we
abandon
our
abstention
doctrine
in
the
lower
court
and
attempted
to
meet
what
the
fifth
circuit
now
has
seemingly
in
the
makres
versus
askew
case
coming
florida.
what
seems
to
be
a
unitary
standard
showing
compelling
interest
and
overwriting
significance
in
all
matters
whether
they
arise
from
due
process
or
from
some
other
incident
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
in
the
case
of
iowa,
we
feel
that
our
statute
is
tailored
to
minimize
overbreadth
by
applying
the
durational
residency
rules
only
in
those
cases
where
the
respondent
is
not
a
resident
and
cannot
be
served
personally
in
the
state
and
for
this
reason
we
feel
that
we
have
in
reenacting
a
requirement
that
has
long
been
on
the
books
of
iowa
help
to
formulate
a
valuable
standard
and
we
have
them
pointed
out
in
the
uniform
marriage
and
divorce
act
as
being
one
of
the
original
states
to
take
part
in
this
kind
of
uniformity
in
this
area
of
the
law
and
for
this
reason,
the
federal
district
court
action
was
argued
by
the
state.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
well,
in
judge
keck's
decision
which
is
sent
out
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
there's
a
reference
to
korsrud
versus
korsrud
that's
in
242
iowa
i
believe
and
45
n.w.2d,
i
think
it
is.
in
any
event,
that
case
involved
a
petitioner
who
originally
was
a
resident
of
the
state
of
iowa.
he
took
up
residence
in
hawaii
and
attempted
to
obtain
a
divorce
there.
then
he
came
back
to
the
state
of
iowa
on
being
advised
at
hawaii
that
iowa
is
the
proper
place
to
bring
his
action
and
obtained
a
divorce
without
informing
his
spouse
who
later
came
back
and
contested
the
validity
of
that
divorce
on
the
basis
that
the
court
had
not
had
jurisdictional
--
the
fact
of
jurisdictional
basis
for
giving
the
divorce
and
that
order
was
invalidated
and
we
find
this
in
our
own
--
from
our
own
experience
in
iowa.
so
it
is
possible
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
the
supreme
court
did
test
the
validity
of
that
statute
at
that
time
and
held
that
there
was
a
sham
domicile
pled
and
that
it
was
a
victim
of
fraud
and
that
the
court
was
a
victim
of
fraud.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
and
the
court
applied
the
statute,
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
in
my
recollection,
it
was
attacked
only
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
the
court
had
jurisdiction
but
i
think
that
is
essential
to
the
constitutional
validity
of
that
particular
section
of
the
code.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
right.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
right.
i
think
it
should
be
mentioned
here
also
that
in
the
district
court,
this
petitioner
came
in
and
the
court
found
that
not
only
did
the
petitioner
failed
to
alleged
the
one
year
residence
which
is
mandatory
under
the
circumstances
of
that
particular
action
but
that
also
the
plaintiff
failed
to
plead
that
her
residence
in
the
state
had
been
in
good
faith
and
not
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
marriage
dissolution.
this
is
not
an
issue
in
this
particular
case
but
both
of
these
requirements
are
mandatory
under
the
iowa
dissolution
of
marriage
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
well,
i
would
say
that
as
close
as
uniform
laws
are
uniform,
iowa
statute
is
the
uniform
law,
yes.
it
contains
requirements
that
there
be
an
allegation
of
a
breakdown
of
the
marriage
relationship.
this
is
also
one
of
the
reasons
that
we
were
interested
in
pursuing
this
in
the
federal
court
because
we
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
determine
that
the
state
of
iowa
did
have
jurisdiction
over
the
marital
status.
in
this
particular
instance,
it
appears
from
the
allegations
in
the
federal
action
that
the
plaintiff
and
from
the
answers
to
the
interrogatories
also
that
the
plaintiff's
marital
relationship
with
her
husband
had
broken
down
somewhere
outside
the
state
of
iowa
and
some
several
months
prior
to
her
relocation
in
the
state
of
iowa.
so,
it
may
and
we
felt
it
was
questionable
as
to
whether
or
not
there
actually
was
a
jurisdiction
over
the
marital
status
in
the
state
of
iowa
although
one
of
the
parties
alleged
to
be
domiciled
there.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
believe
it
was
sir.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
in
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
there
were
interrogatories
propounded
and
answered
in
the
federal
court
action
and
i
believe
this
information
is
contained
clearly
in
the
answers
of
the
individual
counsel.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
we
appeared
in
that
action
as
defendants.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
we
would
be
happy
if
the
court
would
put
a
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
--
stamp
of
approval
on
our
state
statute.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
pardon
me?
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
the
action
that
was
brought
was
for
a
declaratory
action
for
declaratory
judgment.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
would
say
yes
that
that
is
true.
the
state
of
iowa
had
no
con
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
don't
know,
i
don't
think
that's
been
the
rule
in
iowa
for
sometime
because
our
statutes
do
permit
the
court
to
take
jurisdiction
if
one
of
the
parties
is
domicile.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
have
no
knowledge
of
other
states
in
that
particular
regard.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
well,
my
position
on
this
question
before
this
court
is
that
there
appears
to
have
been
a
proper
appeal
from
a
district
court
order
and
that
this
court
does
have
authority
and
power
to
affirm
that
lower
court
decision
which
is
what
we
asked.
with
respect
to
the
class
action
as
such,
i
think
that
that
entire
matter
has
now
been
made
moot.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
think
so
but
i
think
that
the
appeal
is
preserved
or
was
properly
preserved.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
believe
so.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
well,
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
the
controversy
was
that
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
what
is
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
feel
that
the
petitioner
in
the
original
action
although
now
divorced
and
i
assume
removed
from
the
state
of
iowa
would
have
only
the
controversy
grounds
that
existed
at
the
time
that
the
action
was
originally
brought
and
that
is
to
have
the
question
determined
under
the
civil
rights
sections
of
the
code
and
then
to
pursue
any
decision
through
appeal
to
the
highest
court
in
the
land.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
are
you
referring
to
the
divisible
divorce
here?
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
thank
you,
i
appreciate
it.
i
don't
have
the
answer
really
to
the
question.
i
assume
that
this
appeal
was
brought
in
good
faith
and
that
the
court
took
jurisdiction
of
it
in
good
faith.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
pardon
me?
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
do
not
know.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
as
of
this
morning
it
sounds
like
they
aren't
other
than
judge
keck
and
the
state
of
iowa.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
have
not
brief
that
and
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
no
i'm
not.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i'm
not
but
in
all
of
this
time
no
other
party
has
come
forth
to
join
this
class.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
i
don't
ask
you
to
do
that.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
when
the
divorce
took
place?
i
didn't
hear
about
it
until
this
morning,
evidently
it
has
taken
place
in
new
york
state.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
in
younger
versus
harris,
had
the
--
we
would
contend
that
had
the
court
or
had
they
pursue
this
appeal
to
the
state
court,
that
younger
versus
harris
would
be
applicable
here
but
on
the
other
hand,
there
seems
to
be
an
overriding
interest
in
getting
some
kind
of
certainty
append
to
these
types
of
jurisdictional
questions
and
--
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
correct
we
did
not.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
yes.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
correct.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
we
did
abandon
it
below.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
it
is
but
we
did
not
have
the
opportunity
of
taking
this
case
to
the
iowa
supreme
court.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
that's
right.
ms.
elizabeth
a.
nolan
the
case
is
moot
but
in
order
to
present
the
other
side
of
this
argument
before
this
court
we
appear.
thank
you.
