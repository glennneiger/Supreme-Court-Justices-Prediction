was
there
any
damage
to
light
or
was
it
just
to
the
tanker?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
the
divided
damages
rule
at
least
make
it
easier
to
settle
these
cases
so
there
is
less
judicial
time
taken
up
with
trying
to
figure
out
whether
you
are
65%
at
fault
or
35%
at
fault?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
all
we
could
decide
in
this
case
if
we
followed
your
suggestion
is
that
75:25
fault
means
75:25
division
of
damage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
wouldn't
write
a
statute
i
suppose?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
why
you
say
there
are
no
real
support
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
time
you
have
a
finding
of
negligence
plus
approximate
cause
on
the
part
of
two
parties
to
an
accident,
they
are
both
responsible
to
a
degree,
i
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
just
don't
follow
you
on
that
at
all.
surely
he
could
find
it
with
probably
more
reason
on
this
record,
that
had
it
not
been
for
your
master's
fault,
there
would
have
been
no
accident?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
kind
of
a
but-for
causation
type
of
thing,
that
even
though
it's
a
fairly
minor
fault,
that
you
can
say,
that
but-for
the
government's
fault,
it
wouldn't
have
happened,
even
though
your
man
was
very
far
field
from
normal
care
after
he
acted
on
his
own?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
but-for
type
of
causation
as
a
final
conclusion
has
been
rejected
in
almost
every
branch
of
jurisprudence,
hasn't
it?
