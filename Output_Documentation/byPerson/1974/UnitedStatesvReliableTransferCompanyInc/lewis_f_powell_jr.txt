justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
rupp,
the
government
in
the
courts
below
relied
also
on
the
doctrine
of
last
cleared
chance.
i
take
it
you
are
not
pressing
that
issue
here?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
is
good
deal
of
equity
in
it
though,
isn't
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
rupp,
i
couldn't
hear
mr.
justice
powell's
question,
and
i
hope
this
isn't
really
repetitive,
is
the
government's
position
here
consistent
in
your
estimation
with
trend
toward
no
fault
insurance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
mintz,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
fault
was
entirely
that
of
the
coast
guard?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
district
judge
found
to
the
contrary,
didn't
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
he
said
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
think
this
is
a
conclusion
that
fault
of
the
vessel
was
more
egregious
than
the
fault
of
the
coast
guard?
