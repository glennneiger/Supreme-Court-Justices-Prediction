mr.
john
p.
rupp
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
government's
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
this
sole
question
presented
by
the
petition
was
whether
the
admiralty
rule
applied
to
mutual
fault
collision
cases
of
dividing
damages
equally,
should
be
replaced
by
a
rule
apportioning
damages
in
proportion
to
fault.
the
facts
necessary
to
provide
a
context
for
consideration
of
this
question
are
few,
and
are
rather
fully
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief
on
the
merits.
briefly
on
the
evening
of
december
23,
1968,
respondent's
tanker
the
mary
a.
whalen,
left
constable
hook,
new
jersey
in
heavy
winds
and
high
seas
bound
for
island
park,
new
york
with
a
load
of
fuel
oil.
during
the
course
of
the
passage,
the
vessel
became
stranded
to
the
west
of
an
inoperative
breakwater
light,
on
promontory
known
as
rockaway
point.
after
a
trial
that
lasted
for
several
days,
the
district
court
held
that
although
the
coast
guard
had
been
at
fault
in
failing
to
complete
repairs
on
the
breakwater
light
earlier,
the
fault
of
the
captain
and
crew
of
the
mary.
a.
whalen,
respondent's
vessel,
had
been
far
more
egregious.
specifically
the
court
found
that
the
stranding
was
due
25%
to
the
negligence
of
the
coast
guard,
the
fault
of
the
coast
guard,
and
75%,
to
the
negligence
of
the
captain
and
crew
of
the
whalen.
despite
the
fact
that
the
court
found
the
respective
faults
of
the
parties
to
have
been
disparate,
and
after
having
observed
that
while
a
division
of
damages
in
proportionate
to
fault
might
be
more
equitable
in
this
case,
the
court
nevertheless
applied
the
divided
damages
rule
or
ordered
that
the
damage
hearing
beheld
in
which
a
divided
damages
rule
would
be
applied.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
stating
that
so
far
as
negligence
was
concerned,
the
vessel's
claim
that
it
was
not
at
fault
borders
on
the
frivolous
and
with
respect
to
remedy,
that
it
was
powerless
to
divide
the
damages
other
than
equally,
even
though
it
recognized
the
force
of
the
argument
that
in
a
case
of
this
sort,
an
unequal
proportional
division
of
damages
would
be
more
equitable.
although
respondent
chose
not
to
file
a
cross
petition
in
this
case,
it
nonetheless
sought
in
its
opposition
to
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari,
and
in
its
brief
on
the
merits
to
raise
an
issue
entirely
separate
from
the
issue
of
divided
damages,
with
respect
to
which
the
government
petitioned.
that
issue
is
whether
the
courts
below
correctly
apportioned
fault
between
the
parties.
in
its
brief
in
opposition,
the
thrust
of
the
arguments
made
by
respondent
were
that
--
were
to
the
effect
that
this
case
is
an
inappropriate
vehicle
for
reconsideration
by
this
court
of
the
divided
damages
rule.
in
its
brief
on
the
merits,
the
argument
appears
to
be
that
the
courts
below,
the
factual
findings
of
the
courts
below
found
by
the
district
court,
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
were
incorrect,
they
are
seeking
a
de
novo
reweighing
of
those
findings
by
this
court
ultimately
for
a
vacating
of
the
judgment
below,
and
a
remand
to
the
court
with
instructions
to
direct
an
increase
in
the
judgment
in
its
favor.
the
contention
that
respondent
need
not
cross
petition
on
an
issue,
such
as
this
i
think
the
cases
of
this
court
relatively
clearly
answer.
the
general
rule
was
perhaps
most
clearly
stated
i
think
in
lang
versus
green,
and
the
holding
in
that
case
has
been
approved
and
extended
to
some
extent
in
a
number
of
recent
cases,
including
this
court's
recent
decision
in
itt
versus
continental
baking.
i
should
note
additionally,
since
there
appears
to
be
a
misapprehension
on
this
point,
on
the
part
of
respondent,
that
the
present
case
is
very
much
unlike
union
oil
company
versus
the
san
jacinto,
the
case
which
this
court
took
a
couple
of
years
ago,
to
consider
the
continuing
vitality
of
the
divided
damages
rule.
in
that
case,
petitioner
both
petitioned,
presented
the
question
of
whether
the
finding
a
fault
below
was
proper,
and
secondly,
so
far
as
the
respective
negligence
of
the
parties
was
concerned,
the
dispute
there
involved
the
dispute
over
a
question
of
law,
and
not
an
issue
of
fact
which
is
involved
in
this
case.
unlike
the
situation
with
which
this
court
was
presented
in
the
san
jacinto
then,
this
case
presents
in
clear
and
uncomplicated
form,
the
continuing
vitality
of
the
divided
damages
rule.
in
our
briefs
on
the
merits
we
attempted
to
set
out
in
some
detail
the
historical
antecedence
of
the
divided
damages
rule.
as
noted
there,
the
rule
can
be
traced
with
some
assurance
to
rules
of
admiralty
which
once
prevailed
in
england
and
france,
and
in
most
other
major
maritime
nations.
originally
the
rule
was
primarily
or
rather
exclusively
a
risk
sharing
device.
in
the
middle
of
the
16th
century
however,
with
the
development
of
negligence
concepts,
particularly
in
english
jurisprudence,
the
rationale
of
the
rule
began
to
undergo
a
continuing
process
of
erosion,
a
process
which
i
would
suggest
has
continued
to
this
day.
by
the
first
quarter
of
the
19th
century,
application
of
the
rule
was
restricted
to
cases
in
england,
to
cases
of
sole
fault,
and
was
expressly
inapplicable,
pursuant
to
the
decision
of
the
house
of
lords
in
hay
versus
le
neve,
inapplicable
to
cases
of
sole
fault
to
cases
of
inevitable
accident,
and
the
cases
of
inscrutable
fault.
inevitable
accident,
that
is
those
cases
of
collisions
resulting
from
such
things
as
acts
of
god,
an
inscrutable
fault,
where
fault
cannot
be
--
precise
locus
of
fault
could
not
be
determined.
the
first
case
decided
by
this
court
applying
the
divided
damages
rule,
that
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
issue
was
squarely
presented
for
decision,
was
the
schooner
catharine
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1854.
from
the
opinion
in
that
case
and
subsequent
cases,
it's
relatively
clear
that
the
rule
was
adapted
by
this
court
for
at
least
three
relatively
distinct
reasons.
first,
because
of
the
assumed
difficulty
of
courts
in
apportioning
damages
other
than
equally
in
mutual
fault
collision
cases.
secondly,
because
it
was
hoped
that
the
rule
would
induce
a
greater
degree
of
care
and
navigation,
and
finally
because
of
this
court's
[inaudible]
in
applying
a
doctrine
of
bar
of
contributory
negligence
in
cases
of
this
sort.
we
submit
that
none
of
these
considerations
carries
much
weight
today,
but
that
the
later
rational
is
particularly
instructive,
that
is
that
the
divided
damages
rule
represents
an
improvement
over
the
common
law
bar
of
contributory
negligence.
this
court's
refusal
to
import
into
admiralty
law,
the
common
law
principle
of
contributory
negligence,
is
a
reflection
of
this
court's
inherent
power
often
affirmed
to
give
and
withhold
damages
in
admiralty
cases
upon
the
large
principles
of
equity.
perhaps
no
where
in
the
admiralty
law
has
this
principle
been
more
uniformly
followed
than
in
cases
involving
personal
injury
or
death.
even
before
this
court's
decision
in
the
max
morris
in
1890,
lower
courts
were
apportioning
damages
in
collisions
--
in
accidents,
subject
to
admiralty
law,
accidents
involving
personal
injury,
proportionally.
the
court
in
the
max
morris
did
not
specifically
address
that
issue,
or
did
not
decide
that
issue,
although
its
decision
in
that
case
speeded
that
development.
over
time
the
remedy
of
proportional
damages
has
become
coterminous
with
the
substantive
rights
of
people
to
maintain
causes
of
action
in
admiralty
for
personal
injury
and
death.
that
development
has
been
specifically
approved
by
congress
of
course
in
the
jones
act,
and
implemented
by
congress
in
the
jones
act,
in
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
as
well
as
others.
so,
as
far
as
property
damage
is
concerned
however,
a
number
of
commentators,
notably
among
them,
gilmore
and
black,
have
suggested
that
it
is
far
from
clear
that
replacing
a
bar
of
contributory
negligence
in
mutual
fault
collision
cases,
represents
an
improvement
over
the
bar
of
contributory
negligence.
the
capacity
of
the
rule
to
produce
inequitable
results
is
i
think
amply
demonstrated
by
the
facts
of
the
present
case.
the
government
in
this
case
was
found
to
have
been
25%
at
fault,
because
of
its
failure
to
repair
the
rockaway
point
breakwater
light
more
speedily.
yet,
under
the
divided
damages
rule,
it's
liable
for
50%
of
the
total
damages
suffered
in
the
stranding
of
the
whalen.
under
the
doctrine
of
contributory
negligence,
the
government
would
be
immune
from
any
liability
in
this
case,
even
though
it
was
found
it
would
have
been
25%
at
fault.
in
the
first
case,
under
the
divided
damages
rule,
the
windfall
is
in
the
favor
of
the
respondent.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
think
there
was
no
damage
to
the
light.
i
think
all
of
the
damage
in
the
case,
occasioned
by
the
stranding
was
caused
to
the
vessel,
and
its
cargo.
in
the
one
case,
the
windfall
is
25%
in
respondent's
favor.
if
a
contributory
negligence
doctrine
were
applied
in
this
area,
the
windfall
would
be
25%
in
the
government's
favor.
the
gap
between
what
is
equitable
in
cases
of
this
sort,
and
the
result
produced
by
application
of
the
divided
damages
rule,
i
think
becomes
clearest,
in
cases
which
involves
statutory
fault,
and
the
doctrine
of
statutory
fault,
of
course
emanates
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
pennsylvania.
the
rule
of
the
pennsylvania,
is
that
the
party
to
a
collision,
guilty
of
a
statutory
violation
must
prove
not
merely
that
its
fault
might
not
have
been
one
of
the
causes
of
the
collision,
or
that
it
probably
was
not,
but
that
it
could
not
have
been.
this
is
a
burden
seldom
carried
in
practice,
with
result
that
parties
guilty
of
simply
a
technical
violation,
all
--
often
find
themselves
condemned
to
pay
50%
of
the
damage
by
virtue
of
the
joint
operation
of
the
rule
of
pennsylvania,
and
the
divided
damages
rule.
not
surprisingly,
the
number
of
such
cases
have
widely
disparate
fault
covered
by
the
divided
damages
rule
has
increased
in
rough
proportion
to
the
proliferation
of
rules
of
navigation.
presently
there
are
four
sets
of
rules
of
navigation
provided
by
federal
statute;
the
international
rules,
the
great
lakes
rules,
the
inland
rules
and
a
western
river
rules,
as
well
as
three
sets
of
pilot
rules
and
regulations
issued
by
the
coast
guards
in
state
and
local
statutes
and
regulations.
at
pages
17
and18
of
our
brief,
we
sketch
the
procedures
generally
applicable
to
admiralty
cases
involving
collisions,
procedures
which
i
think,
put
in
some
perspective
the
scope
and
the
intensity
of
the
criticism
that
over
time
has
been
directed
at
application
of
the
divided
damages
rule
and
mutual
fault
collisions.
as
we
indicated
there,
while
the
inequity
of
the
divided
damages
rule
is
often
shielded
to
some
extent
from
public
scrutiny,
there
has
been
an
increasing
and
substantial
amount
of
public
criticism,
particularly
in
recent
years,
concerning
application
of
the
rule.
indeed
our
research
in
this
case
has
not
turned
up
a
single
commentator,
it
was
a
proof
continue
application
of
the
divided
damages
rule
and
i
hasten
to
add
that
that
does
not
mean
that
there
are
none,
i
simply
haven't
found
one.
perhaps
the
most
telling
criticism
of
the
rule,
and
the
principle
reason
that
the
government
is
here
today,
requesting
that
it
be
abrogated
in
favor
of
the
proportional
fault
rule,
is
that
the
united
states
today
stands
alone
among
the
major
maritime
nations
of
the
world,
in
applying
a
divided
damages
rule
in
mutual
fault
collision
cases.
this
fact
i
think
is
significant
for
several
reasons.
first,
it
provides
rather
conclusive
support
from
the
view,
for
the
view
rather,
that
there
is
a
readily
available
and
workable
alternative
to
the
rule
of
divided
damages,
namely,
the
proportional
fault
rule.
second,
the
isolated
maintenance,
the
divided
damage
rule
in
this
country,
has
the
inevitable
affect
of
encouraging
transoceanic
forum
shopping,
a
point
which
is
made,
i
think
most
clearly
in
gilmore
and
black
[inaudible].
third,
the
fact
that
the
united
states
alone
applies
a
rule
of
divided
damages,
introduces
in
the
international
maritime
commerce,
a
good
deal
of
unpredictability,
and
i
think
in
a
necessary
amount
of
unpredictability.
this
court,
we
submit,
has
already
recognized
the,
implicitly
recognized
the
unfairness
of
the
divided
damages
rule,
at
least
in
the
most
extreme
case
of
disparate
fault,
by
creation
of
a
so
called
major-minor
fault
exception.
the
major-minor
fault
rule
stems
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
the
umbria.
the
rule
we
stated
in
the
city
of
new
york
is
as
follows:
where
fault
on
the
part
of
one
vessel
is
of
itself,
sufficient
to
account
for
the
disaster.
any
reasonable
doubt
with
regards
to
the
propriety
of
the
conduct
of
such
other
vessel,
should
be
resolved
in
the
other
vessel's
favor.
as
noted
at
pages
24
and
25
of
our
brief,
the
major-minor
fault
rule
has
proven
extremely
difficult
to
apply
in
practice.
one
of
the
problems
of
the
rule
is
that,
it
encourages
courts
to
avoid
a
full
and
fair
consideration
of
cases
on
its
merits,
in
cases
where
the
fault
is
obviously
disparate.
more
importantly,
i
think
however,
is
the
fact
that
the
major-minor
fault
rule
itself
involves
inequity,
that
is,
it
absolves
parties
from
fault
even
though,
excuse
me,
it
absolves
parties
from
liability,
from
paying
damages,
even
though
found
to
have
been
at
fault.
the
rule
is
i
think
then
to
that
extent,
but
a
variation
of
the
contributorily
negligence
doctrine.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
was
a
point
which
was
discussed
at
some
length,
i
recall
in
the
briefs
filed
in
san
jacinto.
i
think
that's
not
the
case.
if
a
party
is
involved
in
a
collision
in
which
his
fault
is
minor,
and
the
lion's
share
of
the
damage
occurs
to
the
other
vessel,
there
is
every
motivation
not
to
settle,
because
not
to
settle,
both
gives
the
relatively
less
negligent
party
a
shot
at
the
major-minor
fault
rule,
and
also
stays
the
day
which
there
is
going
to
have
to
be
a
substantial
payment;
to
be
more
negligent
relatively
greater
damaged
vessel.
i
think
the
best
--
the
most
that
can
be
said,
is
that
whether
damages
would
be
encouraged
or
discouraged
relatively,
by
moving
to
a
proportional
fault
rule,
is
specular.
i
conceive
as
and
i
gave
you
an
example
of
the
case
in
which
the
opposite
would
be
the
case,
my
point
i
am
sure
can
suggest
any
cool
number
of
cases
in
which
a
divided
damages
rule
would
encourage
settlement.
but
i
think
that
my
own
view
is
that
the
court
---
this
court
ought
not
to
approve
a
rule
which
encourages
settlements
which
are
unfair,
which
is
something
that
divided
damages
rule
does,
that
is
if
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that's
right,
that's
right.
now,
while
the
court
need
not
necessarily
reach
the
issue
in
this
case,
we
would
suggest
that
the
major-minor
fault
rule
is
itself
badly
in
need
of
reconsideration.
if
the
rule
of
proportional
fault
is
adopted
as
we
suggest,
i
see
little
residual
need
left
for
the
major-minor
fault
rule.
and
that
rule
has
masqueraded
under
various
other
names
as
well,
it's
called
glossing
in
some
courts.
other
courts
says
analyze
fault
in
terms
of
their
active
or
passive
characteristics,
in
cases
in
which
the
fault
is
obviously
disparate.
the
opportunity
to
move
away
from
the
major-minor
fault
rule,
i
think
represents
a
major
advantage
of
a
proportional
fault
rule,
and
people
like
black
and
gilmore,
and
judge
friendly
in
the
second
circuit
agree.
it's
important
to
be
clearly
understood
that
the
government
is
not
in
this
case
asking
the
court
to
do
the
congress'
work,
and
to
ratify
the
brussels
convention
of
1912.
it
is
true
that
part
of
the
explanation
for
the
failure
of
the
convention
to
be
ratified,
is
the
fact
that
various
of
its
provisions
have
been
opposed
by
specific
interest
groups.
that
opposition
has
not
however,
been
directed
at
the
proportional
fault
rule,
which
appears
in
paragraph
1
of
article
4,
of
the
convention.
it
has
instead
been
directed
at
other
provisions
of
the
convention
which
are
severable.
cargo
interest,
for
example,
have
vigorously
opposed
the
elimination
in
paragraph
2
of
article
4
of
the
convention
of
joint
and
several
liability
in
the
event
of
a
collision,
contending
i
think,
with
some
justification
that
such
a
change
in
their
substantive
right
to
recover
should
be
effective
if
at
all,
by
the
legislative
process,
rather
than
by
treaty
ratification.
a
number
of
other
groups
have
proposed
article
6
which
eliminates
legal
presumptions
of
fault.
congress'
failure
to
replace
the
divided
damages
rule
with
the
proportional
fault
rule
in
the
face
of
the
almost
unanimous
support
for
that
course
evidenced
during
the
hearings
in
brussels
convention.
simply
means
we
would
suggest
that
the
responsibility
for
the
rule
has
remained
where
it
began
with
this
court.
as
this
court
stated
in
a
not
dissimilar
context
in
moragne
versus
states
lines,
we
do
not
think
that
congress'
failure
to
take
action
on
depending
bail
or
to
pass
a
similar
measure
over
the
years
as
the
law
of
deaths
on
territorial
waters
became
more
in
congress,
provides
guidance
for
the
course
that
we
should
take
in
this
case.
to
conclude
the
congress
by
not
legislating
on
this
subject,
it
has
an
affect
foreclosed
by
negative
legislation
as
it
were,
reconsideration
of
prior
judicial
doctrine
would
be
to
disregard
the
fact
that
congress
has
already
left
in
this
court
the
responsibility
for
fashioning
the
controlling
rules
of
admiralty
law.
i
think
that
applies
with
equal
force
here.
we
are
satisfied
moreover
that
there
no
impediments
to
adoption
of
the
proportional
fault
rule
by
this
court
in
this
case.
although
the
rule
of
divided
damages
has
been
applied
in
this
country
for
over
a
hundred
years,
it
is
becoming
increasingly
anomalous
over
time,
and
the
reasons
originally
invoked
in
support
of
it
have
become
increasingly
unpersuasive
i
would
suggest.
it
seems
a
little
late
to
argue
for
example,
that
courts
will
prove
incapable
of
applying
a
doctrine
of
comparative
negligence.
contrary
is
proven
to
have
been
the
case
in
all
other
places
in
the
world
where
the
proportional
fault
rule
has
been
adopted
by
treaty
or
by
judicial
decisions,
and
courts
in
this
country
have
long
been
become
accustomed
to
applying
proportional
fault
rules
as
well,
and
have
been
proven
capable
of
doing
so
more
particularly
in
admiralty
where
personal
injuries
have
been
involved.
if
mathematical
certitude
is
not
possible,
gilmore
&
black
are
nevertheless
surely
correct
in
suggesting
that
the
proportional
fault
rule
would
at
least
not
be
designed
to
go
wrong
in
as
many
cases
as
the
divided
damages
rule.
it
does
repeating
in
addition
i
think,
that
we
are
not
asking
in
this
case
for
the
abrogation
of
the
divided
damages
--
of
divided
damages,
or
fifty-fifty
division
of
damages.
in
cases
where
the
locus
of
fault,
the
precise
locus
of
fault,
or
the
percentage
of
contribution
of
fault
cannot
be
determined,
or
in
cases
in
which
fault
is
relatively
equally
borne
by
both
parties.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that's
right,
that's
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
that's
right,
and
that's
precisely
what
we
are
asking
for.
to
the
extent
it
was
contended
that
the
divided
damages
rule
is
more
likely
to
induce
care
in
navigation
to
a
proportional
fault
rule,
which
was
one
of
the
principle
motivations
for
the
decision
in
the
schooner
catharine,
i
would
suggest
that
the
contention
at
this
point
at
least
runs
directly
counter
to
logic
and
experience.
the
divided
damages
rule
lumps
the
egregiously
negligent,
with
a
party
guilty
of
only
minor
fault,
the
result
is
to
make
the
degree
of
respective
fault
irrelevant,
is
to
remove
any
inducement
to
the
practice
of
greater
and
greater
degrees
of
care.
finally,
i
should
like
to
address
myself
briefly
to
another
point
discussed
at
some
length
in
the
merit's
briefs
in
the
san
jacinto
case,
but
not
touched
upon
to
this
point
by
respondent
in
this
case,
that
is,
as
for
this
court
at
this
point,
to
adopt
a
proportional
fault
rule
with
the
inconsistent
with
the
policies
expressed
by
congress
in
the
harter
act
in
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
i
think
that
that
argument
fails
for
several
reasons.
one,
is
that
the
only
problem
in
that
respect,
if
it
is
a
problem,
when
we
contend
that
it
is
not,
stems
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
chattahoochee
in
1899,
the
harter
act
was
passed
in
1893.
the
harter
act
generally
with
a
number
of
exceptions
released
from
direct
suit,
the
carrying
vessel
for
damage
to
cargo.
in
the
chattahoochee,
this
court
decided
that
congress
did
not
mean
by
the
harter
act
to
effect
the
relationship
between
one
vessel
and
another,
or
in
a
case
of
this
sort,
between
the
united
states
and
the
carrying
vessel,
and
i
think
the
same
result,
i
think
that
that
decision
was
correct,
and
the
court
has
i
should
point
out
reached
the
same
result
in
cases
arising
under
the
workers
and
longshoreman
compensation
act
in
admiralty,
as
well
under
other
statutes,
workmen
compensation
type
statutes.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
of
either
the
harter
act
or
the
carriage
of
goods
by
sea
act.
the
congress
meant
to
remove
from
this
court
its
historical
discretion
to
enforce
rules
which
go
to
remedy
in
admiralty,
i
see
no
inconsistency
with
the
harter
act,
and
the
course
of
the
government
is
asking
this
court
to
take
in
this
case.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well
of
course
that,
this
court
could
do
that.
this
court
could
replace
the
divided
damages
rule
with
the
doctrine
of
contributory
negligence
in
admiralty.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
the
schooner
catherine
–
the
schooner
catherine.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
no,
that's
right,
simply
overruling
the
schooner
catherine
would
not
get
us
where
we
feel
we
should
be
in
this
case.
the
court
would
have
to
affirm
--
would
have
to
reverse
the
decision
of
court
of
appeals,
and
direct
that
judgment
be
entered
for
damages
in
proportion
to
the
degrees
of
fault
found.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
apportioning
fault
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
that
is
correct,
yes
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that's
right,
essentially
what
we
were
asking
you
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
that
is
correct,
we
are
asking
that
this
court
move
away
from
the
rule
of
divided
damages
in
light
of
the
movement
of
the
rest
of
the
world,
and
the
problems
which
that
has
occasioned,
not
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
that's
correct
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
the
first
paragraph
of
article
4.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
yes,
that
is
right,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
at
that
point.
congress
has
proved,
the
court
has
led
the
way
in
the
area
of
personal
injuries
in
enforcing
proportional
fault,
and
importuning
damages
in
proportion
to
fault.
there
are
no
circumstances
which
make
it
more
appropriate
or
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
act
in
this
case,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
rest
of
the
world
has
already
done
it,
which
we
suggest
makes
it
all
the
more
justifiable.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
we
are
not.
we
did
not
petition
on
the
issue
of
the
party's
respective
fault
in
heart,
because
we
felt
it
wasn't
the
matter
which
we
assert
reaally
and
consequently
i
don't
press
it
here.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
there
may
well
be.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
well,
i
am
not
as
conversion
as
no
fault
insurance
as
i
might
be,
i
think
probably
not.
we
are
not
here
concerned
about
the
speediest
most
expeditious
resolution
of
these
disputes,
although
in
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
approval
by
this
court
of
the
proportional
fault
rule
would
lead
to
any
less
expedition.
the
rule
which
we
were
asking
the
court
to
adopt
here
is
consistent
with
the
normal
rules
of
negligence,
negligence
particularly
as
applied
in
the
area
of
personal
injury
and
admiralty
law.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
it
does
indeed.
i
think
that's
particularly
so,
given
the
fact
that
two
years
ago
this
court
gave
very
clear
indication
that
it
was
prepared
to
consider
again
on
the
merits,
the
vitality
of
the
divided
damages
rule.
in
the
san
jacinto
you
got
no
merits
briefs
from
insurance
companies
or
any
other
group.
i
think
that,
that's
explicable,
because
if
one
reads
the
hearings
which
have
been
held
in
the
brussels
convention,
it's
apparent
that
no
one
opposes
this.
you
have
got
no
amicus
briefs
here,
and
i
think
again,
it
suggests
that
there
is
no
real
opposition,
other
than
the
party
standing
to
lose
first
by
application
of
a
proportional
fault
rule.
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no
real
support
for
--
oh,
for
opposition.
perhaps
they
were
prepared
to
rely
on
us.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
john
p.
rupp
i
think
not,
we
attempted
to
set
that
out
as
clearly
as
we
could
and
in
some
detail
in
our
brief.
there
was
a
problem
initially
at
the
convention
of
a
poor
translation,
that
led
to
a
good
deal
of
confusion.
we
explained
to
some
extend
the
delay
--
mr.
john
p.
rupp
no,
there
is
absolutely
not
–
yes
--
