respondent.
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
writ
of
certiorari
which
we
granted
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
more
than
a
century
ago
in
the
case
of
the
schooner
catharine,
this
court
established
in
our
admiralty
law
the
rule
of
divided
damages.
that
rule,
most
commonly
applied
in
cases
of
collision
between
two
vessels,
requires
the
equal
division
of
property
damage
whenever
both
parties
are
found
to
be
guilty
of
contributing
fault,
whatever
the
relative
degree
of
their
fault
may
have
been.
in
this
case,
involving
a
vessel
that
ran
aground
off
rockaway
point
outside
new
york
harbor,
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
applied
this
long
settled
rule
of
american
admiralty
law.
but
the
courts
of
every
major
maritime
nation
except
ours
have
long
since
abandoned
that
rule
and
they
now
assess
damages
in
such
cases
on
the
basis
of
proportionate
fault
when
such
an
allocation
can
reasonably
be
made.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
decide
whether
this
countryâ€™s
admiralty
rule
of
divided
damages
should
be
replaced
by
a
rule
requiring
when
possible
the
allocation
of
liability
for
damages
in
proportion
to
the
relative
fault
of
each
party.
for
the
reason
set
out
in
detail
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court,
we
hold
that
when
two
or
more
parties
have
contributed
by
their
fault
to
cause
property
damage
in
a
maritime
collision
or
stranding,
liability
for
such
damage
is
to
allocated
among
the
parties
proportionately
to
the
comparative
degree
of
their
fault
and
that
liability
for
such
damages
is
to
be
allocated
equally
only
when
the
parties
are
equally
at
fault
or
when
it
is
not
possible
fairly
to
measure
the
comparative
degree
of
their
fault.
accordingly,
the
judgment
before
us
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today.
