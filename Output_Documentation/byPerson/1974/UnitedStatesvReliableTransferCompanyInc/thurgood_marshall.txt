you
think
50-50
is
unjust
to
those?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
still
want
to
get
off
with
50%?
you
wouldn't
get
off

then
i
read
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
we
hold
that
the
court
was
not
clearly
erroneous
in
finding
that
the
negligence
of
both
parties
in
the
portions
stated
caused
the
stranding.
the
vessel's
claim
that
it
was
not
its
fault
borders
on
the
privilege.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
will
say
that's
the
finding
of
the
court
that
you
were
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
the
court
of
appeals
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
this
[inaudible]
i
find
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
the
other
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
in
the
next
paragraph
after
saying
which
is
its
privilege.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
he
talking
about
there?
the
last
clear
chance
doctrine,
that's
what
he
was
talking
about,
which
is
not
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
further
down
in
the
paragraph
you
will
see
it.
we
refuse
to
apply
here
the
doctrine
of
the
last
clear
chance,
which
has
been
give
only
limited
application
in
admiralty.
