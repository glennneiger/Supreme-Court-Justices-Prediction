mr.
copal
mintz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
united
states
stands
alone
as
stated
by
my
friend
here,
because
congress
has
chosen
to
retain
the
rule
as
is.
it's
had
ample
opportunity
to
either
confirm
the
brussels
convention
or
to
adopt
a
statute
which
would
incorporate
the
rule
in
respect
to
divided
the
damages.
mr.
copal
mintz
i
doubt
it
very
much,
because
congress
has
been
very
active
in
legislating
in
this
area,
the
admiralty.
it's
adopted
any
number
of
statutes,
and
to
assume
that
congress
has
not
taken
up
this
out
of
[inaudible]
it
seems
to
me,
it
isn't
being
unfair
to
congress.
i
think
it's
more
fair
to
say
that
congress
has
decided
the
rule
as
is
is
better
than
proposed
one.
i
would
like
to
now
go
to
my
argument.
contrary
to
the
contentions
that
have
been
made
by
my
friend,
i
think
the
issues
here
still
are;
one,
is
this
case
an
inappropriate
basis
for
the
reconsideration
of
the
divided
damage
rule?
i
will
elaborate
on
that
in
just
a
minute,
but
in
the
meantime,
i
want
to
set
forth
the
other
merits,
issues.
two,
is
this
court
the
appropriate
forum
or
body
to
consider
changing
the
rule,
or
should
it
be
left
to
congress?
and
three,
on
the
merits
of
the
rule,
and
of
the
alternative
fair
to
urged
by
petitioner,
is
the
latter
equitable,
more
logical,
more
practical,
and
thus
more
desirable
than
the
present
rule.
i
now
suggest
that
the
government
must
prevail
on
each
of
these
issues
in
order
to
be
entitled
to
a
judgment
in
its
favor
from
this
court.
now
on
the
first
issue,
there
is
no
finding
really
of
25%
and
75%,
that's
an
adjudication,
it's
a
judgment,
so
expressed
by
judge
judd.
he
said,
â€œit's
difficult
to
arrive
at
mathematical
determinations,
and
on
all
the
evidence
i
conclude
that
25%
and
75%
is
fair
--
mr.
copal
mintz
yes,
and
in
those
cases
where
it's
evident
that
one
is
very
slightly
at
fault,
then
you
don't
give
him
a
recovery,
and
you
don't
hold
him
liable,
i
should
say
don't
hold
him
liable.
but
where
have
you
come
to,
how
does
one
say
it's
25,
and
not
30,
not
35,
it's
75,
not
65,
and
all
that,
what
basis
is
that
to
make
those
determinations
as
far
as
the
fault
is
concerned,
beyond
that
i
suggest,
that's
irrelevant.
because
where
you
have
a
situation,
where
but
for
the
negligence
of
both,
there
would
be
no
accidents
then
it's
irrelevant,
whether
the
contribution
of
one
or
the
others,
25
or
75,
whatever
the
ratio
maybe,
if
he
hadn't
been
at
fault,
there
would
have
been
no
accident.
therefore,
why
should
he
not
share
in
the
damage,
because
that
is
the
result
of
the
co-negligence
of
both
parties.
now
here
on
more
over,
the
government
has
been
guilty
of
a
statutory
violation
for
over
24
hours
has
left
that
light
unlit.
it
knew
it,
it
had
notice
on
it,
and
under
the
rules
that
my
friend
has
cited
this
court
has
several
times
decided
that
where
the
cause
of
a
disaster
or
accident
is
a
violation
of
a
statutory
duty,
that
then
it
bares
the
entire
liability,
unless
it's
conclusively
demonstrated,
and
that
it
wasn't
the
sole
cause.
so
we
have
here
prima
facie
case
where
sole
cause
was
the
government's
and
yet
judge
judd's
finding
that
the
accident
would
not
have
occurred,
that
is
the
finding
of
the
fact,
that
the
accident
would
not
have
occurred,
and
the
damages
would
not
have
been
sustained
if
the
light
had
not
been
burning.
so
we
have
here
a
straightforward
finding
which
brings
it
into
play
the
rule
that
i
have
just
adverted
to,
and
that
my
friend
adverted
to,
that
where
the
negligence
consists
of
violation
of
a
statutory
duty,
the
violator
bears
the
entire
brunt
of
the
damage.
so
that
here
we
have
a
case
which
under
normal
rules,
would
have
resulted
--
by
application
of
the
normal
rules
would
have
resulted
in
the
finding
that
the
government
is
liable
for
the
entire
damage.
and
yet
we
have
asked
here
to
--
the
court
is
asked
here
to
make
a
determination
nevertheless,
the
damages
should
remain
apportioned
or
should
be
apportioned,
75
to
the
government
--
i
mean
25
to
the
government,
and
75
to
the
vessel,
which
i
think
is
a
gross
injustice,
and
which
i
think
illustrates
that
the
rule
for
which
the
government
is
now
asking
is
really
an
unfair
rule,
and
i
--
mr.
copal
mintz
in
a
case
like
this,
where
the
negligence
was
entirely
the
government's
or
well
whoever
it
may
be,
in
such
a
case,
ot
the
entire
damage
would
be
borne
by
the
person
who
is
less
negligent,
and
that
was
the
determination
of
several
cases
by
this
court,
where
they
held
the
violation
of
the
duty
cast
upon
the
violator,
was
the
complete
responsibility
for
the
consequences.
mr.
copal
mintz
no,
i
am
not.
i
am
not.
we
may
have
to,
but
that
is
not
our
case,
we
were
cross-appellants
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
copal
mintz
we
couldn't
have
been
a
cross-petitioner
here,
because
i
don't
think
under
rule
19,
we
could
have
responsively
petitioned
this
court
to
consider
this
case
on
determination
of
who
is
more
liable
than
the
other.
that's
a
question
that
arises
in
normal
cases,
and
this
court
takes
cases
only
when
there
is
a
rule
of
law
involved,
and
not
when
the
issue
of
fact.
mr.
copal
mintz
yes.
mr.
copal
mintz
no,
he
didn't.
mr.
copal
mintz
he
is
inconsistent.
he
says,
but-for
the
negligence
of
the
government
this
accident
would
not
have
happened,
that's
the
finding
of
fact.
the
rest
is
the
conclusion
of
law.
mr.
copal
mintz
yes,
i
think
it
is
where
the
evidentiary
finding
is,
that
but-for
the
fault
of
the
government,
this
would
not
have
happened,
that
his
evidentiary
finding.
mr.
copal
mintz
in
this
decision,
repeated
twice.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it's
commonsense.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
that
determination,
that
but
for
the
negligence
of
the
government,
this
fault
would
not
have
happened.
mr.
copal
mintz
but
what
i
am
saying
your
honor
is
that
where
the
judge
determines,
that
for
the
negligence
of
the
government,
there
would
have
been
no
accident,
then
there
is
no
causative
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
one
who
has
been
hurt.
mr.
copal
mintz
no,
because
the
master's
fault
was
occasioned
by
the
absence
of
the
light.
he
would
not
have
been
--
that's
what
the
finding
is.
he
would
not
have
made
the
maneuver
he
did,
if
he
had
known
where
he
was,
and
he
would
have
known
where
he
was,
if
he
had
the
light.
if
your
honors
will
read
the
decision
of
judge
judd,
you
will
find
those
are
his
basic
findings,
and
those
were
confronted
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
copal
mintz
but
why
was
he
where
he
was?
not
by
reason
of
poor
navigation,
he
was
where
he
was
because
he
was
misled
by
the
absence
of
the
light.
mr.
copal
mintz
well,
i
am
not
--
i
don't
know
that
at
all,
and
i
don't
see
that
if
you
say
that's
not
a
finding
of
facts,
i
think
75
and
25
are
not
findings
of
fact
either.
mr.
copal
mintz
yes,
i
am
--
mr.
copal
mintz
no,
if
--
[voice
overlap]
no,
the
court
was
saying
[voice
overlap]
i
rely
on
the
finding
of
judge
judd
that
but
for
the
negligence
of
the
government,
this
accident
would
not
have
happened.
mr.
copal
mintz
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
yes,
a
matter
of
commonsense.
mr.
copal
mintz
it's
there
on
--
mr.
copal
mintz
the
court
found
as
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
found
as
--
i
am
reading
from
page
4
of
my
brief
--
or
it's
--
you
will
find
it
on
page
10
of
the
appendix.
the
court
found
as
commonsense
would
dictate
that
the
if
the
breakwater
light
had
been
operating,
the
captain
would
not
have
stranded
the
vessel.
mr.
copal
mintz
that's
correct.
those
again
are
inconsistent
and
judge
judd
said,
if
the
breakwater
lights
had
been
flashing,
the
captain
would
doubtless
have
been
able
to
change
his
course
in
time
to
avoid
stranding.
mr.
copal
mintz
well,
i
don't
know
what
he
is
talking
about
the
last
clear
chance.
mr.
copal
mintz
is
there
any
inconsistency?
mr.
copal
mintz
i
think
there
is,
i
think
there
is,
that
now
--
mr.
copal
mintz
it
does
sir,
it
does.
i
am
glad
your
honor
i
feel
that
there
is
an
inconsistency,
but
it
has
been
my
argument
all
along
that
you
can't
put
the
two
together
and
justify
both
of
them.
and
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
said
that
we
bordered
on
the
frivolous,
and
arguing
that,
i
would
like
to
say,
if
i
may,
that
attending
recently
a
session
of
the
court
of
appeals
where
applications
for
parole
after
conviction
pending
appeal,
the
arguments
was
always
made
--
the
trial
judge
said
that
was
a
frivolous
appeal,
and
one
of
the
justices
answered,
well
--
he
remembers
that
when
he
was
a
district
judge,
he
regarded
many
applications
for
bail
as
being
frivolous,
but
now
that
he
is
on
the
court
of
appeals,
he
has
a
different
view
of
that.
so
i
think
that
applies
to
the
statement
that
borders
on
the
frivolous
when
we
have
a
situation
of
the
kind
your
honor
has
just
pointed
to.
now,
assuming
that
we
have
here
a
split
liability
case
or
a
split
fault
case,
the
question
then
is,
should
to
this
court
reconsider
the
rule?
now
this
has
been
a
rule
of
this
court
since
1843.
it
has
been
mentioned
and
repeatedly
discussed
and
repeatedly
sustained
in
a
number
of
cases,
and
i
can
roll
them
off,
catharine
v.
dickinson,
17
how
in
1943,
the
north
star
in
1882,
the
max
morris
in
1890,
the
chattahoochee
in
1899,
the
eugene
moran
in
1909,
white
oak
transportation
in
1922,
weyerhaeuser
in
1963,
and
just
recently
a
few
years
ago,
cooper
stevedoring
versus
kopke
in
1974,
where
in
opinion
by
judge
marshall,
there
was
express
approval
of
the
rule
although
he
did
make
a
footnote
that
you
are
not
called
upon
to
reconsider
it,
because
there
was
no
finding
that
had
to
be
reviewed
or
something
to
that
effect.
and
we
also
have
the
fact
that
we
had
the
brussels
convention.
it
had
been
submitted
to
congress
for
ratification;
congress
failed,
has
failed
continually.
there
has
been
no
pressure
for
congress
to
go
ahead,
and
for
this
court
to
undertake
to
refashion
the
rule,
which
has
been
in
existence
for
so
many
years,
and
has
been
repeatedly
[inaudible],
taken
into
account,
it
seems
to
me
is
rather
inappropriate.
i
suggest
that
if
this
is
really
legislation
and
not
adjudication,
and
it's
more
more
properly
in
the
area
of
congress,
than
the
area
of
the
judiciary.
to
be
sure,
there
have
been
have
many
commentators
who
have
said
that
--
have
found
fault
with
the
rule,
including
among
them
very
eminent
jurists,
but
that
in
of
itself
is
not
sufficient,
because
there
is
always
disagreements
among
lawyers
and
among
judges
on
various
phases
of
the
law,
and
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
courts
refashion
the
rules.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
court
is
without
power
to
do
so.
i
am
suggesting
that
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
there
has
been
--
where
the
history
is
as
it
is,
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
undertake
to
do
the
work
which
congress
should
do,
and
which
it
has
refused
to
do
indicating
that
it
is
quite
content
to
let
the
rule
stay
as
it
is.
now,
on
the
merits
of
the
rule,
i
think
i
indicated
to
some
extent
my
thinking
on
the
subject.
i
think
that
where
an
accident
is
the
result
of
co-negligence
on
two
parties
or
three
parties,
whatever
it
maybe,
in
a
situation
where
but
for
the
negligence
of
both,
there
would
have
been
no
accident,
it
is
immaterial,
it
is
irrelevant,
as
to
how
much
fault
--
in
what
proportion
the
parties
were
at
fault,
because
the
accident
would
not
have
happened
if
both
had
not
been
at
fault,
and
both
had
been
at
fault,
it's
fair
and
just
that
the
damages
should
be
borne
equally.
rather
than
an
attempt
to
say,
well,
you
hold
only
10%
negligence,
so
we
are
going
to
hold
you
liable
for
10%
of
the
consequences,
but
for
the
10%
it
would
not
have
been
the
accident.
and
then
again,
we
have
this
practical
problem,
how
do
you
assess
fault
on
a
mathematical
basis
when
the
conduct
is
not
in
the
mathematical
area.
it's
easier
to
see
some
party
was
negligent
or
not
negligent,
but
it
is
not
easy
to
say
you
were
at
fault
to
a
certain
extent.
and
i
rest
on
that,
and
more
importantly
i
rest
on
the
proposition
that
it
is
an
immaterial
consideration.
but
if,
i
contribute
to
somebody's
damage,
and
i
did
that
to
substantial
degree,
that
is,
i
am
normally
liable
for
the
whole
damage,
but
if
the
other
fellow
was
also
damage
liable,
it's
perfectly
fair
for
me
to
pay
half
of
his
damages,
or
have
him
to
pay
half
of
my
damages
where
the
accident
would
not
have
otherwise
have
happened.
i
think
i
have
covered
substance
of
my
argument,
and
will
not
detain
this
court
any
longer.
