ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
by
the
government
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
california.
in
this
class
action,
the
court
struck
down
the
nine-month
duration
of
marriage
requirement
for
entitlement
to
mothers
and
stepchild's
benefits
imposed
by
section
416
(c)
and
416
(e)
of
the
social
security
act.
that
act
provides
benefits
for
surviving
minor
children
of
a
wage
earner
and
for
the
mothers
of
those
children
and
as
the
court
said
this
morning,
the
fathers,
so
that
they
need
not
work
outside
of
the
home.
but
416
(e)
of
the
act
defines
the
child
of
a
deceased
wage
earner
to
exclude
short-term
stepchildren,
that
is
ones
whose
natural
parent
had
married
the
wage
earner
in
less
than
nine
months
before
his
death
and
of
course
the
mothers
of
such
ineligible
children
are
not
entitled
to
mother's
benefits
to
permit
them
to
stay
home
to
take
care
of
the
ineligible
children.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
indication
is
that
congress
felt
that
nine
months
was
long
enough
to
deter
marriages
designed
to
obtain
benefits.
there
is
also
apparently
some
idea
that
wherein
some
short
period
there
isn't
the
kind
of
dependency
developed
which
is
--
needs
to
be
recognized
by
social
security
payments
when
the
expectation
is
disappointed.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
not
so
far
as
i
know.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
court
below
found
that
the
nine-month
eligibility
requirement
was
unconstitutional
because
it
thought
that
it
established
a
conclusive
presumption
that
shorter
marriages
are
undertaken
to
secure
benefits.
it
concluded
that
claimants
like
mrs.
salfi
and
her
daughter
doreen
kalnins
are
constitutionally
entitled
to
disprove
that
presumption.
the
district
court
was
wrong.
the
duration
of
marriage
requirement
is
a
substantive
limitation
on
eligibility.
it
reflects
a
legislative
policy
decision
that
marriage
alone
is
not
a
sufficient
qualification
for
benefits
and
there
--
so
that
the
stepfather's
obligation
to
support
his
stepchild
generally
matures
overtime.
still
less
is
it
--
as
it
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
social
security
act
requires
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
but
the
social
security
doesn't
make
the
eligibility
turn
on
the
state
law
requirements.
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
this
reflects
one
of
the
important
factors
in
the
social
security
act
that
the
--
each
specific
provision
reflects
the
interrelation
and
the
resultant
effect
of
many
different
policies
that
the
general
policy
may
--
having
this
exception
because
of
other
policies
which
are
impinge.
the
accident
section
was
added
in
1967.
it
was
a
part
of
--
there
were
two
exceptions
put
in
at
that
time.
one
was
for
the
survivors
of
servicemen
who
die
on
an
active
duty
and
that
clearly
obviously
was
designed
to
recognize
the
particular
special
responsibility,
federal
responsibility
for
people
who
are
killed
in
the
federal
service.
and
congress
may
have
thought
that
people
who
die
in
accidents
earned
some
sense
similar,
they
too
are
likely
to
be
young
and
the
act
has
always
had
a
particular
concern
for
people,
the
survivors
of
wage
earners
who
die
before
they
have
a
chance
to
build
up
financial
security
for
their
families
when
living,
families,
young
families.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
--
well,
the
other
basic
--
the
congress
in
these
duration
of
marriage
requirements
was
looking
at
the
problems
of
the
question
of
motivations
for
entering
into
valid
marriages.
they
didn't
want
to
pay
benefits
to
those
who
married
simply
to
get
benefits,
who
were
--
thought
of
marriage
is
a
condition
of
eligibility
for
a
government
subsidy.
but
the
provision
is
not
a
--
kind
of
a
rough
evidentiary
tool
to
identify
those
marriages
which
were
entered
into
out
of
a
desire
to
obtain
benefits.
instead,
it
is
designed
to
serve
as
a
deterrent
or
more
precisely
to
make
sure
that
the
act
doesn't
become
an
incentive
to
marriage.
congress
thought
that
few
people
would
marry
for
benefits
which
they
couldn't
get
for
many
months
after
marriage
and
that's
why
wives
of
retired
workers
are
not
entitled
to
benefits
unless
they
have
been
married
for
a
year.
it's
also
why
widows
and
their
children
in
appellee's
class
are
not
entitled
to
benefits
on
the
basis
of
a
marriage
which
ended
in
death
in
less
than
nine
months.
if
the
duration
of
marriage
requirements
were
simply
evidentiary
presumptions
the
waiting
period
for
wives
would
make
no
sense
because
all
wives
are
entitled
after
a
year.
and
that's
--
so
that
that
provision
has
no
evidentiary
purpose
in
identifying
marriage
as
motivated
by
a
desire
for
benefits.
the
fact
that
there
is
this
waiting
period
for
wives
as
well
as
for
widows
demonstrates
the
deterrent
purpose
of
all
the
duration
of
marriage
requirements.
there
are
substantive
conditions
of
eligibility
and
they're
designed
primarily
to
avoid
any
incentive,
the
act
might
otherwise
provide
for
marriage.
the
fact
that
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
mentioned,
there
is
a
group
of
survivors
that
congress
has
excused
from
these
duration
of
marriage
requirements
doesn't
indicate
any
general
exception
to
the
provisions
of
the
act
requiring
duration
of
marriage.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
we
are
not
satisfied
that
there
was
jurisdiction
for
--
to
the
extent
that
it
imposed
a
--
identified
a
class
and
required
retroactive
payments
to
all
members
of
the
class.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
--
its
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it's
possible.
they're
right
on
the
line.
the
child
is
--
was
currently
14.
she
would
ordinarily
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
until
she
is
18
or
if
she
goes
to
college
until
she
is
22
and
if
she
is
entitled
for
five
years,
or
about
five
years,
she'll
make
it.
its
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
payment
of
benefits
to
the
survivors
of
accident
victims
without
--
immediately
doesn't
undercut
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
statute.
since
--
when
death
is
by
accident,
it's
by
definition
unanticipated
and
so,
payment
of
benefits
in
accident
cases
can
be
no
incentive
to
people
who
might
be
contemplate
marriage
to
obtain
benefits.
of
course
death
from
natural
causes
can
also
be
unanticipated.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
ordinarily
i
think
that
the
fact
that
it
was
by
accident
would
appear
on
the
death
certificate,
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
these
cases,
the
fact
of
an
accidental
death
is
pretty
much
self-evident.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
am
not
sure
whether
suicide
is
excluded.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
function
of
this
provision
in
this
act
is
to
deter
the
entering
into
marriages
in
order
to
obtain
benefits
and
i
believe
it's
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
statute
that
distinguishes
it.
the
congress
has
usually
moved
step
by
step
in
revising
the
social
security
act
and
extending
the
benefits
to
particular
classes
and
particular
problems
are
identified.
one
of
the
things
congress
considers
in
deciding
whether
to
extend
the
benefit
is
the
effect
on
the
fund
created
by
social
secure
--
the
social
security
fund
which
is
created
from
the
taxes
and
of
which
the
benefits
are
paid.
social
security
system
is
supposed
to
be
basically
an
insurance
program.
so
the
actuarial
soundness
of
the
fund
is
a
matter
of
great
concern
to
congress.
and
if
it
--
a
decision
of
the
fund
can
afford
the
obligation
to
pay
benefits
to
survivors
of
accident
victims,
doesn't
mean
that
it
can
also
afford
payment
to
survivors
of
other
short-term
marriages
or
than
it
--
that
it
could
afford
to
eliminate
the
duration
of
marriage
requirement
altogether.
the
sufficiency
of
the
fund
is
basic
to
the
effectiveness
of
the
insurance
system.
and
so
in
this
area
it
is
particularly
important
to
permit
congress
to
move
step
by
step
in
expanding
the
obligation
chargeable
against
the
fund.
so
long
as
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
distinguishing
the
categories
that
congress
defines,
this
court
should
not
interfere
particularly
when
as
here
there
is
no
classification
involved
which
requires
any
kind
of
higher
than
normal
judicial
scrutiny.
on
the
retroactivity
question,
we
rely
primarily
on
the
discussion
in
our
brief.
i
would
like
to
address
briefly
the
appellee's
statement
that
our
sovereign
immunity
argument
is
only
a
claim
that
they
fail
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies.
we
discuss
in
our
brief
the
reason
why
we
believe
that
42
u.s.c.
405
(g)
is
the
only
possible
jurisdictional
basis
for
this
suit
and
that
section
has
two
important
limitations
on
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
first,
is
the
requirement
that
the
administrative
remedies
must
be
exhausted.
but
second
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
there
is
no
stipulation
in
this
case.
but
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
it
would
make
a
difference
as
to
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
we
did
not.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
apparently
because
wiesenfeld
wasn't
a
class
action.
what
we're
concerned
about
in
this
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
--
that's
the
problem
that
we're
addressing
here.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
we
didn't
raise
that.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no.
the
--
pardon?
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
problem
that
we
see
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
didn't
notice
the
provision
for
retroactive
payments
and
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
just
don't
want
you
to
order
retroactive
payments
here[attempt
to
laughter].
the
other
provision
in
section
405
(g)
is
that
the
claim
must
be
filed
within
60
days
of
the
final
administrative
decision.
so
even
if
the
exhaustion
requirement
can
be
ignored
in
cases
raising
constitutional
claims,
the
time
limit
must
still
be
respected.
it's
because
once
a
claim
has
been
denied
and
60
days
have
passed,
that
denial
is
final
and
the
finality
is
important
to
the
actuarial
assumptions
on
which
the
social
security
system
is
based.
it
protects
the
fund
out
of
which
benefits
are
paid
from
any
possibilities
that
large
contingent
liabilities
will
be
built
up.
individual
appellees
here
filed
promptly,
but
the
class
recognized
by
the
district
court
includes
all
those
previously
denied
benefits
because
of
the
nine-month
rule.
it
does
includes
claimants
whose
denials
became
final
more
than
60
days
before
this
suit
and
as
to
those
claimants,
there
has
been
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
payment
of
the
benefits
to
them
imposes
just
the
kind
of
liability
on
the
fund
that
405
(g)
is
designed
to
avoid.
it's
about
$35
million
in
this
case
which
is
serious
enough,
but
a
decision
that
class
actions
can
be
used
to
avoid
the
finality
provisions
of
405
(g)
is
even
more
serious
because
that
would
mean
that
any
denial
of
benefits
based
on
the
statutory
requirement
later
declared
invalid
could
be
reopened
at
any
time
in
a
class
action
and
the
contingent
liability
of
the
fund
is
then
enormous
and
totally
unpredictable
and
that's
the
kind
of
actuarial
nightmare
that
405
(g)
is
designed
to
prevent.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
stipulation
in
the
district
court
was
to
the
facts.
it
was
not
to
the
jurisdiction.
we
contested
the
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
as
we
did
here.
the
regulation
which
my
opponent
refers
to
concerning
retroactive
benefits
--
retroactive
payments
went
back
for
--
four
years
after
benefits
are
denied
is
designed
to
recognize
that
in
individual
cases
in
which
errors
and
adjudications
are
noted.
the
administration
can
go
back
and
correct
those
errors
on
an
individual
basis.
that
doesn't
open
up
the
possibility
of
a
whole
scale
reconsideration,
that
would
be
the
case
here.
the
other
point
is
that
if
it
were
jurisdiction
under
1331
which
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
we
don't
believe
there
is,
the
members
of
the
class
by
my
opponent's
arithmetic
would
be
entitled
to
an
average
of
$1750.00,
couldn't
meet
the
$10,000.00
jurisdictional
amount.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
average
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
they
don't.
but
this
indicates
that
sweeping
a
whole
bunch
of
people
in
--
under
the
class
action
may
mean
that
you
have
very
serious
problems
about
the
individual
eligibility
of
each
person.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that's
right,
it
did.
and
it's
very
hard
to
know
whether
any
of
these
are
--
which
ones
these
members
of
this
class,
and
of
course
the
other
that
the
class
retroactivity
problem
involves
is
it's
--
it
just
going
to
mean
that
the
social
security
administration
will
have
to
determine
whether
for
--
if
you
go
back
for
four
years,
you're
going
to
have
to
look
at
month
by
month
earnings
to
determine
whether
the
individual
people
were
entitled
and
resurrecting
those
accounts
could
be
exceedingly
difficult.
i
believe
that's
all
i
have.
