justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
there
is
no
stipulation
here
as
there
was
in
wiesenfeld
this
morning?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
--
it
would
be
futile
to
exhaust
remedies?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
would
make
a
difference,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
didn't
argue
--
you
didn't
argue
sovereign
immunity
in
wiesenfeld?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wondered
why,
because
of
the
stipulation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wiesenfeld
was
a
--
there
was
a
provision
of
the
order
we
affirmed
this
morning,
requiring
back
payment
of
those
benefits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
why
you
didn't
raise
it,
you
didn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
wondered
if
the
stipulation
of
that,
it
would've
been
futile
in
the
case
at
the
issue
then
to
exhaust
it.
was
that
the
reason
that
you
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
maybe
i'm
wrong
but
i
think
that
provision
as
to
retroactive
of
benefits
apply
to
more
than
just
wiesenfeld,
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
well,
--
yes.
yes,
it's
there,
it's
in
the
order,
we
affirmed
this
morning?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
legally?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
an
argument
of
that
itself
as
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
you
--
i
gather
you
say
here
if
the
--
that
ssa
had
admitted
that
it
did
made
a
mistake
in
this
case
then
the
operation
of
that
regulation
would've
paid
these
benefits
back
to
the
date
of
mr.
salfi's
death?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
–
would
there
be
a
reduction
of
benefits
if
mrs.
salfi
were
working
and
earning?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
--
that
same
that
we
had
in
wiesenfeld,
a
dollar
for
every
dollars
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(voice
overlap)
in
this
class
and
maybe
many
will
have
to
go
to
work,
they
haven't
been
getting
any
benefit
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
--
going
to
--
that's
the
whole
story
mr.
kates,
after
all
there
was
a
stipulation
and
i
tried
to
get,
i
couldn't
from
mrs.
shapiro
when
relied
on
that
as
the
reason
they
never
raised
this
sovereign
immunity
question
in
wiesenfeld?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
fact
is
they
did
and
you
don't
have
a
similar
stipulation
here,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
to
their
agency,
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
stipulation
in
wiesenfeld.
i
thought
it
went
beyond,
isn't
it?
it
was
that
you
don't
have
to
exhaust
your
remedies
in
wiesenfeld
because
it
will
be
futile
to
do
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
this,
do
you
read
405
(g)
as
waiving
sovereign
immunity,
whatever
its
fact
may
weigh,
conditionally
upon
the
exhaustion
of
remedies?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
for
back
payments,
do
you
regard
the
suit
you
brought
as
a
suit
under
405
(g)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
408
says
that
--
because
they
got
it
misstated
when
they
talk
about
--
what
is
it,
section
7142,
but
that
there's
no
other
avenue
for
this
kind
of
recovery
except
the
405
(g)
recovery,
hasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
limiting
to
the
question
i
asked
because
it
was
limited
to
this
back
benefits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
still
1331?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
bothers
me
on
your
first
argument
is,
in
this
--
and
to
the
extent
you're
going
before
back
benefits,
is
the
provision
of
405
(h)
which
says,
“that
no
proceeding
shall
be
brought
under
--
i
forgotten
the
exact
language
--
section
71
of
28
or
42
u.s.c.,
i
forgot
which
one,
28
i
think,
was
apparently
from
history,
71
is
all
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
court
(voice
overlap)
because
the
government
didn't
raise
it,
we
didn't
have
to
wrestle
with
it
in
wiesenfeld,
but
i
suppose
we
could
in
this
case?
