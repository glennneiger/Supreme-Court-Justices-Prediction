justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
suicide
excluded?
that's
what
you
usually
get
into
the
play
in
an
insurance
case,
whether
it
was
an
accident
or
whether
it
was
suicide?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
death
definition
of
accident
in
the
act
says
it
has
to
be
solely
by
external
causes.
the
act
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
unexpected
death
from
natural
causes
is
far
more
difficult
to
identify.
a
claim
could
be
made
in
any
case
where
death
occurred
within
nine
months
of
marriage.
the
secretary
would
then
have
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
life
expectancy
at
the
time
of
marriage.
and
that
judgment
is
by
its
nature
speculative
and
the
possibility
of
error
is
evident
to
any
who
might
be
tempted
to
marry
for
benefits.
there
are
other
rational
reasons
for
congress
to
have
decided
to
waive
the
duration
of
marriage
condition
for
survivors
of
accident
victims.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
(inaudible)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
case
of
the
terminal
illness
person
and
you
say
that
nobody
loses
anything,
but
if
the
purpose
of
the
thing
is
to
deter
that
kind
of
marriages
for
the
benefit,
i
would
presume
that
the
putative
spouse
who
is
going
to
marriage
--
marry
the
terminally
ill
person
would
be
a
little
less
likely
to
do
it
if
she
knew
that
he
had
to
last
nine
months?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
some
consequences
certainly
attach
to
marriage
other
than
getting
social
security
benefits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
she
quits
her
job
at
the
time
she
is
married
and
tries
to
go
back
to
that
or
a
similar
job
a
month
afterward,
she's
going
to
have
an
easier
time
than
she's
been
out
--
if
she
has
been
off
the
market
for
a
year,
isn't
she?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
congress
entitled
to
take
into
consideration
this
kind
of
things
that
you
--
you
say
are
marginal
when
its
drafting
anything
as
this,
much
of
a
tapestry
as
a
social
security
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
any
members
of
this
class
who'd
--
have
not
--
would
not
have
been
in
compliance
with
section
402
(j)
(1),
the
one
that
limits
it
to
a
one
year
before
the
application?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
(inaudible)
last
year
hold
that
each
member
of
the
class
had
to
meet
the
$10,000.00
requirement?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
social
security
act
provides
benefits
for
minor
children
of
deceased
wage
earners
and
for
mothers
of
such
children
who
have
them
in
their
care.
the
act
defines
eligible
children
and
mothers
in
such
a
way
that
a
wage
earner's
stepchildren
and
their
mother
are
eligible
only
if
the
mother's
marriage
to
the
wage
earner
and
the
child's
relationship
as
a
stepchild
of
the
wage
earner
had
existed
for
at
least
nine
months
before
the
wage
earner's
death.
appellees
in
this
case
were
claimants
under
the
act
and
they
were
excluded
from
benefits
by
this
nine
months
requirement.
after
presenting
their
claims
to
the
social
security
administration,
they
filed
this
class
action
alleging
that
the
requirement
was
unconstitutional.
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
california
agreed
with
them
concluding
that
the
requirement
constituted
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
marriages
entered
less
than
nine
months
before
the
wage
earner's
death
were
entered
into
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
social
security
benefits.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
the
secretary's
appeal
and
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
we
initially
conclude
for
reasons
set
out
at
length
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
that
the
district
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
consider
that
complaint
insofar
as
it
sought
to
recover
benefits
in
behalf
of
class
members
who
had
not
exhausted
their
administrative
remedies.
as
for
the
named
appellees,
the
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction
and
we
therefore
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
controversy
as
to
them.
our
cases
have
consistently
established
that
statutory
classifications
regarding
eligibility
for
publicly
financed
benefit
programs
are
consistent
with
the
constitution
if
they
are
rationally
related
to
a
legitimate
governmental
interest
and
do
not
invidiously
discriminate
among
claimants.
the
nine-month
duration
of
relationship
requirement
in
this
act
meets
that
standard.
congress
could
reasonably
have
concluded
that
the
requirement
would
protect
against
the
occurrence
of
an
abused
which
it
legitimately
wished
to
avoid
marriages
entered
into
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
benefits
on
the
basis
of
the
social
security
contributions
of
a
wage
earner
who
was
expected
shortly
to
die.
while
the
requirement
does
not
necessarily
exclude
all
claimants
who
entered
such
sham
relationships
and
plainly
does
not
exclude
--
does
exclude
some
persons
whose
good
faith
marriages
were
terminated
by
an
unexpected
death.
it
was
nonetheless
not
unreasonable
for
congress
to
conclude
that
the
requirements
inherent
imprecision
was
justified
by
its
clarity
and
ease
of
administration.
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
therefore
reversed.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
marshall
has
joined.
