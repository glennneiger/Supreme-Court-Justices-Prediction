r.
white
based
on
the
--
justice

the

is
it
possible
that
the

white
what's
(inaudible)?
justice

that
was
a
chance
that
they
should
take
some
precautions
against
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let's
assume
there
was
evidence
that
a
--
of
a
substantial
incidence
of
fraudulent

would
that
make
a
difference
to
you?
justice

r.
white
well,
(voice
overlap)
arguing
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
are
you
arguing
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
--
you're
suggesting
congress
in
a
law
may
not
classify
--
may
not
treat
a
group
was
a
class
unless
every
single
member
of
the
group
shares
the
same
characteristics?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
were
the
other
way
around?
justice
byron
r.
white

on
both
equal
protection
and
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
conclusive
presumption
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
are
saying
congress
cannot
classify
in
this
way
unless
every
single
member
of
the
class
shares
the
trade?
justice
byron
r.
white
stanley
against
illinois
and
those
cases
had
some,
not
vlandis
but
stanley
against
illinois
specifically
said
that
there
was
a
kind
of
a
special
relationship
that
it
--
that
required
some
kind
of
special
scrutiny?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
it
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
marriage.[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
--
i'd
like
to
know
what
--
i'd
like
to
know
what
your
answer
is
to
justice
stewart's
question
besides,
mr.
justice
stewart's
answer?[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
on
any
other
justice
whenever
you
can?[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
is
your
answer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
the
--
the
next
congress
could've
made
a
judgment
that
a
person
or
widow,
a
wife
who's
been
married
for
nine
months
or
a
year
or
two
years
is
more
entitled
to
benefits
than
one
who's
only
been
married
for
a
day
or
a
week.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
might
need
them
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
they
didn't
but
they
could've?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
does
in
the
class
of
equal
protection
terms.
you
--
if
you
could
dream
up
of
good
reasons
for
a
law
you
--
good
reason
for
a
discrimination,
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
save
the
law
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
that
arguably
congress
could've
decided
that
the
wife
has
only
been
married
a
short
time,
are
more
confident
to
take
care
of
themselves,
their
husband
died
than
if
they
have
been
married
longer?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
far?
