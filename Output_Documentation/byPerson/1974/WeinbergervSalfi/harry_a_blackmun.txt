do
you
know
that
the
reason
for
the
nine
months,
why
is
it
nine
rather
than
10
or
12?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
related
to
the
period
of
gestation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
shapiro,
if
what
you
just
said
is
so,
why
is
there
the
exception
in
the
statute
for
death
by
accident?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
in
your
view
then
a
distinction
between
a
death
by
accident
and
one
by
surprising
heart
attack
is
a
policy
decision?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
though
the
wage
earner
might
be
33?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
you
can
have
a
problem
as
to
whether
it
is
by
accident?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
does
the
department
do?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
whether
after
an
automobile
collision,
the
victim
has
a
heart
attack
and
dies,
is
that
by
accident?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
always
the
same
definition
and
always
the
same
litigation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mrs.
shapiro
let
me
interrupt
you
once
again.
there
was
a
time
in
the
federal
state
tax
law
when
a
gift
made
within
three
years
of
death
was
deemed
to
be
made
in
contemplation
to
death.
isn't
this
statute
rather
reminiscent
to
that
and
that's
--
that
was
held
invalid
as
i
recall?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
(voice
overlap)
changed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
in
your
answer
to
justice
white,
you're
really
reaching
for
unattainable
perfection,
aren't
you?
