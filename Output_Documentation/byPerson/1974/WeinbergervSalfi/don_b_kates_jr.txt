mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
don
kates,
counsel
for
appellee
in
this
matter.
before
i
go
into
my
prepared
argument
i'd
like
to
respond
to
a
question
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked.
i'm
informed
by
my
co-counsel
that
there
is
a
specific
regulation
relating
to
suicide.
if
it
is
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
suicide
was
so
mentally
ill
that
he
didn't
know
the
consequences
of
his
act,
it
is
accidental,
otherwise
a
suicide
is
considered
a
--
is
considered
to
come
under
the
ninth-month
conclusive
presumption.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
i
would
also
like
to
respond
just
briefly
to
the
allegations
here
that
a
justification
maybe
offered
for
the
ninth-month
rule
in
terms
either
of
deterrents
or
of
proving
dependency
of
the
stepchild
and
the
widow
upon
the
husband.
as
to
deterrents,
i
mean,
this
is
covered
in
our
brief,
but
as
to
deterrents,
there
is
no
deterrent
factor
of
this
rule
at
all
because
there
is
no
penalty
in
this
rule.
if
a
man
terminally
ill
is
induced
to
enter
into
one
of
these
sham
marriages
and
manages
to
hang
on
for
nine
months
after
the
marriage,
then
the
widow
and
any
children
she
has
are
entitled
to
benefits.
if
he
doesn't
manage
to
hang
on,
nobody
has
lost
anything.
there's
no
deterrents
at
all.
mr.
justice
blackmun
i
believe
referred
to
the
case
of
heiner
versus
donnan
in
which
we
had
a
two
or
three-year
conclusive
presumption
of
a
donor's
intent
to
give
a
gift
in
expectation
of
death,
there
was
equal
deterrents
in
that
case.
if
deterrents
consist
merely
in
the
fact
that
if
they
catch
you
out,
you
don't
succeed.
deterrents
in
our
view,
if
i
may
give
the
example
of
a
bank
robbery
situation,
the
united
states
has
not
merely
passed
a
law
saying
that
if
the
fbi
catches
up
with
the
bank
robber,
he
has
to
give
back
the
money.
the
bank
robber
also
goes
to
jail,
that's
deterrence,
that's
the
cost
which
occurs
in
excess
of
any
benefit
that
you
may
have
gotten
through
the
fraudulent
or
other
illegal
conduct.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
there
certainly
has
been
some
doubt,
although
i
understand
that
the
law
applies
equally
your
honor
whether
they
get
the
money
back
or
not.
perhaps
the
bank
robber
gets
a
little
off
at
his
sentence
for
that,
but
he
certainly
doesn't
go
scot-free
as
would
occur
in
our
case.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
she
might
be
a
little
less
likely
to
do
it
your
honor,
but
if
the
marriage
is
a
sham
which
is
what
this
rule
is
directed
at,
i
don't
see
why
she
really
would.
she
doesn't
have
to
live
with
him.
she
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
at
all
except
marry
him
and
if
he
lives
nine-months,
she
is
automatically
a
widow.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
see
that
any
of
the
deleterious
consequences
would
apply
such
as
they
may
be
speaking
as
a
bachelor.
i
[laughter]
that
i
don't
see
how
any
of
those
deleterious
consequences
would
apply
to
a
sham
marriage
of
this
kind.
the
facts
in
this
case
your
honors
typify
what's
happened
in
thousands
of
cases
because
of
this
nine-month
rule.
the
deceased
wage
earner,
londo
salfi
was
an
active
and
healthy
man
of
52
years
at
the
time
of
the
marriage
with
a
life
expectancy
of
21
years.
routine
medical
examinations
demanded
by
his
employer,
including
one
within
a
year
of
the
marriage
showed
that
he
had
no
heart
problem
or
any
disease
or
debilitation
whatever
as
far
as
his
physicians
could
determine.
indeed
the
possibility
of
a
heart
ailment
was
so
far
off
from
his
mind
that
like
all
too
many
other
people,
he
dismissed
the
first
heart
attack
which
begun
about
a
month
after
the
marriage
as
acute
indigestion
and
the
physician
was
only
called
after
the
symptoms
persisted.
after
his
death,
mrs.
salfi
applied
for
survivorship
benefits
for
herself
and
the
child
by
a
former
marriage,
only
to
meet
an
absolute
bar
of
the
nine-month
rule.
she
offered
medical
and
other
evidence
to
show
that
the
marriage
was
genuine
and
not
contracted
in
contemplation
of
death,
but
none
of
this
could
be
or
was
considered
by
the
social
security
administration
because
of
the
statutory
conclusive
presumption
that
where
a
marriage
has
entered
into
--
in
contemplate
--
is
entered
into
and
the
man
dies
of
natural
causes,
non-accidental
causes
within
nine
months,
the
marriage
is
conclusively
presumed
to
have
been
a
sham
entered
into
in
contemplation
of
death.
mr.
salfi's
unexpected
death
in
this
manner
is
by
no
means
an
isolated
extraordinary
or
unusual
kind
of
event.
on
the
contrary,
every
year,
thousands
of
people
are
struck
down
by
heart
attacks
or
other
ailments
in
the
prime
of
life.
what
is
unusual,
however,
is
a
conclusive
presumption
that
where
this
occurs
within
nine
months
of
marriage,
the
marriage
was
a
sham
entered
into
an
expectation
of
death.
we
wish
very
strongly
to
emphasize
that
the
social
security
administration
had
submitted
absolutely
no
evidence
whatever
that
such
fraudulent
applications
or
that
such
fraudulent
marriages
to
result
in
fraudulent
applications
are
now
or
ever
has
been
any
kind
of
a
problem
for
them.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
we
can
agree
that
that
is
what
congress
did.
however,
the
lack
of
any
evidence
as
to
the
prevalence
of
the
matter
goes
to
the
gravity
of
the
evil,
goes
directly
to
that
issue
and
undercuts
any
attempt
to
justify
the
ninth-month
rule.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
it
would
not
make
a
difference
to
our
conclusive
presumption
argument
your
honor
but
it
would
make
a
difference
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
we
also
rest
this
case
on
an
equal
protection
argument
your
honor
and
we
feel
that
a
classification
is
per
se
unreasonable
where
it
is
so
over
broad
--
well,
to
give
an
example,
a
classification
would
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
absolutely
not
your
honor,
but
we
think
that
a
classification
is
fatally
over
broad
if
it
tosses
out
99
innocent
people
to
catch
one
malefactor.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
if
it
were
the
other
way
around
we
think
that
it
might
well
be
acceptable.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
no
your
honor.
only
upon
equal
protection
grounds
would
it
be
acceptable.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
a
conclusively
presumption
your
honor
is
unconstitutional
unless
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
for
the
purposes
of
the
conclusive
presumption
doctrine,
your
honor,
a
conclusive
presumption
must
be
universally
true.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
i
certainly
do
your
honor
as
well
as
upon
vlandis
and
upon
lafleur.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
i
do
not

mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
well,
your
honor
there
is
as
your
colleague
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
i
always
attempt
to
rely
upon
mr.
justice
stewart
whenever
i
can
your
honor.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
absolutely
your
honor.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
we
do
not
believe
that
other
than
marriage,
there
is
a
special
relationship.
however,
that
would
not
distinguish
this
case
from
vlandis
or
united
states
department
of
agriculture
versus
murry
or
heiner
versus
donnan
or
schlesinger
versus
wisconsin,
all
of
them
concludes
presumption
cases
without
any
special
relationship.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
no
your
honor.
all
that
we
seek
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection
clause
--
in
terms
of
the
conclusive
presumption
matter,
we
believe
that
a
--
that
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
a
person
is
entitled
to
prove
the
facts
of
his
or
her
entitlement
and
that
congress
may
not
arbitrarily
decide
that
an
evidentiary
conclusive
presumption
--
a
presumption
in
this
case
of
a
falsehood
can
be
substituted
for
the
person's
right
to
prove
the
actual
facts.
in
mrs.
salfi's
case
and
in
thousands
of
others,
there
was
no
marriage
in
contemplation
of
death,
there
was
no
lack
of
genuineness.
these
are
all
conceded
facts
your
honor.
mrs.
salfi
was
turned
away
without
any
examination
of
the
facts
of
her
case.
however
when
this
case
was
filed,
the
united
states
or
rather
the
social
security
administration
had
no
hesitation
whatever
in
do
--
in
entering
into
a
stipulation
that
all
the
facts
we
have
relied
upon
here
were
absolutely
true.
that
stipulation
incidentally
will
be
found
since
the
--
since
there's
some
suggestion
in
the
brief
of
the
appellants
in
this
matter
that
they
did
not
stipulate
to
the
allegations
of
the
complaint,
i
refer
you
to
appendix,
page
29,
paragraph,
“there
are
no
genuine
issues,”
this
is
a
stipulation,
“there
are
no
genuine
issues
or
material
fact
in
dispute
concerning
the
adjudication
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
challenged
provision
and
that
this
three-judge
panel
may
finally
determine
the
constitutionality
of
said
challenged
provisions
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
set
out
in
the
complaint,
and
affidavits
heretofore
filed.
to
return
if
i
may
to
the
issue
of
equal
protection
just
very
briefly,
a
classification
in
our
view
would
be
fatally
over
broad
if
it
classified
99
innocent
persons
with
one
malefactor
and
punished
them
all.
here
we
have
a
classification
which
excludes
thousands
of
innocent
persons
right
now
for
the
sake
of
dealing
with
the
purely
hypothetical
danger
that
a
fraudulent
application
may
someday
come
along
for
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record,
no
attempt
to
produce
any
evidence
that
this
concludes
it
presumption
refers
to
anything
which
has
ever
been
a
problem.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
i
--
you
mean
if
--
if
you're
asking
your
honor
whether
congress
could
eliminate
benefits
to
widows
entirely,
it
certainly
could,
yes.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
in
these
circumstances?
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
i
--
i'm
--
you
mean
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
i'm
a
little
uncertain,
you
mean,
whenever
a
person
died
of
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
well,
congress
definitely
could
eliminate
all
widows'
benefits,
your
honor.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
well,
at
that
point
your
honor
i
think
that
congress
would've
made
a
substantive
decision
that
it
didn't
want
to
have
widows'
benefits.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
then
--
when
the
knife
--
they
have
sliced
it
thin
on
their
side
but
very
thick
on
our
side
your
honor.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
congress
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
congress
might
have
made
that
judgment
your
honor,
but
congress
didn't
make
that
judgment
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
that
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
our
case
your
honor.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
i
can
only
say
with
regard
to
that
that
would
--
as
to
the
children's
benefits,
make
this
statute
a
redundancy.
a
stepchild
must
prove
by
actual
evidence
that
he
has
been
supported
by
the
stepfather.
that's
a
requirement
under
the
social
security
act,
a
widow
on
the
other
hand
has
never
been
required
to
prove
dependency,
that's
simply
never
required
by
the
act.
and
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
if
it
had
that
with
itself
have
been
a
conclusive
presumption
that
would've
raised
certain
problems.
i
would
point
out
that
with
regard
to
dependency,
this
is
in
our
brief,
a
woman
becomes
dependent
not
nine
months
after
the
marriage,
but
at
the
time
of
marriage
because
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
well
not
just
legally
your
honor,
factually.
if
she's
going
to
give
up
her
job
that
normally
occurs
before
the
marriage
and
honeymoon,
if
she's
certainly
--
if
she
looses
alimony
or
welfare
or
pension
benefits
from
a
past
marriage,
she
loses
them
on
the
day
--
to
the
marriage,
not
nine
months
or
after.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
marginally
your
honor,
yes.
but
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
well,
your
honor
i
would
concede
that
congress
would
be
entitled
to
take
this
things
into
consideration.
our
argument
is
that
in
the
light
of
the
statute
as
it
exist
in
its
position,
vis-à-vis
the
other
provisions
of
the
statute,
congress
didn't
and
could
not
have
been
considered
to
be
considering
those
factors.
if
it
had,
it
wouldn't
have
bothered
posing
this
nine-month
requirement
for
stepchildren
at
all
because
that's
already
being
tested
directly
by
the
act.
you
don't
need
a
wide
overreaching
conclusive
presumption
where
you've
already
tested
the
matter
directly
and
if
congress
had
desired
to
test
the
matter
as
to
widows,
it
would
simply
require
widows
to
prove
that
they
had
become
dependent
upon
their
husbands.
i
will
pass
now
if
i
may
to
the
issue
of
sovereign
immunity
as
raised
by
the
united
states.
before
undertaking
a
discussion
of
the
technical
aspects
of
that
doctrine
however,
i'd
like
to
make
one
general
consideration
clear.
this
case
is
very
different
from
those
previously
dealt
with
by
this
court
which
have
dealt
--
have
concerned
attempts
to
enforce
contracts
against
the
treasury
or
attempts
to
require
or
prevent
the
disposition
of
unquestionably
sovereign
property.
the
social
security
trust
fund
is
not
only
entirely
separate
from
the
general
treasury.
it
receives
no
funds
from
the
general
treasury.
the
social
security
trust
fund
is
stocked
purely
by
contributors,
contributions
from
wage
earners
and
their
employees
--
employers,
i'm
sorry.
the
federal
government
collects,
invests
and
distributes
these
funds
but
it
does
not
make
any
contributions
on
its
own.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
so
far,
yes
your
honor.
in
other
words,
it
acts
conceptually
as
no
more
than
a
trustee.
to
hold
that
the
government
has
sovereign
immunity
from
a
suit
by
wage
earners
to
a
fund
which
they've
contributed
to
and
the
government
has
not
would
be
to
go
far
out
of
our
way
to
extend
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity,
a
doctrine
which
is
almost
universally
deplored
by
modern
thinkers
as
a
grotesque
and
acryonism
from
the
middle
ages.
there
is
yet
another
prefatory
comment
i'd
like
to
make
before
going
into
general
discretion
of
sovereign
immunity
and
that
is
--
first
of
all,
let
me
make
one
thing
very
clear.
we're
concerned
here
not
with
sovereign
immunity
from
this
suit
as
such,
but
only
with
sovereign
immunity
as
to
benefits
back
--
benefits
for
the
class
back
to
the
date
of
original
entitlement.
now,
there
is
an
important
issue
in
that
regard
which
may
have
been
lost
sight
of
completely
since
ssa
has
studiously
ignored
it.
this
is
that
there
is
an
ssa
regulation
which
requires
exactly
what
we
got
in
this
case,
retroactive
benefits.
whenever
an
application
has
been
found
to
have
been
improperly
denied
that
regulation
is
20
cfr
404.957
and
it
is
quoted
in
our
brief
in
a
footnote.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
no
your
honor.
well,
whether
it
is
a
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
whether
it
is
a
waiver
or
not
we
believe
that
the
court
was
entitled
to
an
order
--
to
order
and
its
order
is
entitled
to
be
affirmed
insofar
as
it
simply
requires
the
social
security
administration
to
treat
the
members
of
the
salfi
class
the
way
it
would
treat
anyone
else
who
came
in
and
showed
that
they
had
erroneously
been
denied
benefits.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
it
would
pay
back
to
four
years
and
that
would
of
course
handle
--
the
salfi's.
it
would
handle
appreciable
number
of
the
class
although
it
would
not
handle
all
the
class
which
is
six
years
back.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
i
would
imagine
that
their
--
according
the
estimate
of
ssa
which
we
accept
because
we
have
no
facts
on
the
matter,
although
i
don't
know
how
they
came
about
theirs,
there
were
20,000
members
of
the
class,
approximately
over
a
six
year
period,
presumably
a
substantial
number
of
those
class
members
are
before
that
six-year
period.
however,
most
of
those
members
would
be
covered
by
this
four
year
period
of
the
ssa
regulation.
now
let
me
for
a
moment
consider
the
--
that
ssa's
estimate
that
paying
benefits
back
to
the
date
of
entitlement
for
the
class
would
cost
$35
million.
we
do
not
agree
to
that
estimate
at
all.
we
note
that
it's
based
on
an
unverified
assertion
in
an
affidavit
which
utterly
fails
to
specify
how
these
figures
were
arrived
at
except
insofar
as
its
obvious
that
they
arrived
at
by
pure
speculation
because
no
one
could
know
this
matter.
no
one
actually
knows
how
many
of
these
applications
were
put
in
at
all.
moreover,
the
affidavit
assumes
what
is
totally
false
which
is
that
everybody
who
has
been
turned
down
in
this
group
of
20,000
even
if
notified
is
going
to
reapply.
some
of
these
people
are
dead.
others
may
for
various
reasons
not
want
to
apply.
moreover,
it
also
assumes
that
all
of
these
people
will
be
entitled
to
benefits.
some
of
them
will
not
be
entitled
to
benefits
for
a
large
number
of
reasons,
including
the
fact
that
they're
not
as
mrs.
salfi
is,
50
years
of
age
and
disabled
or
that
they're
not
less
than
60
years
of
age
or
they
may
be
entitled
--
mrs.
salfi
for
instance
because
she
is
on
disability
gets
a
certain
amount
of
social
security
benefits
anyway.
so
her
entitlement
is
not
to
a
full
survivorship
benefit,
but
to
a
survivorship
benefit
discounted
by
the
amount
of
her
social
security
disability.
the
same
would
apply
to
anyone
who
was
on
old
age
or
retirement
benefits.
ssa
has
naturally
seized
upon
this
figure
of
$35
million
as
representing
an
exorbitant
award
to
the
class,
which
will
minis
the
liquidity
of
the
social
security
system.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
i
believe
there
would
be
your
honor.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
of
course
if
she
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
--
if
she
were
able
to
work,
if
she
went
completely
disabled,
she
wouldn't
be
on
disability
and
shouldn't
be
eligible
at
all.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
yes
your
honor
[attempt
to
laughter]
that's
probably
true
and
their
lack
of
benefits
might
even
have
some
relationship
to
my
comment
that
some
of
them
may
no
longer
be
around.
in
fact
however
even
if
its
accurate,
this
$35
million
figure
does
not
represent
an
exorbitant
return
for
the
class.
it
represents
$1750.00
average
for
each
class
member,
$1750.00
to
which
these
people
were
entitled
and
would've
received
have
they
not
been
deprived
by
an
unconstitutional
law.
more
important,
the
restitution
of
this
amount
does
not
in
any
manner
threaten
the
social
security
system
which
has
a
total
trust
fund,
permanent
trust
fund
of
$46
billion.
indeed,
the
amount
which
was
denied
the
class
over
a
six-year
period
represents
only
a
little
more
of
one
--
a
little
more
than
1/20th
of
1%
of
the
amount
which
was
paid
out
by
ssa
last
year
alone
and
last
year,
ssa
actually
increased
the
trust
fund
because
social
security
tax
has
exceeded
benefit
payments
by
$1.5
billion.
it
had
been
my
intention
to
discuss
in
some
detail
the
question
of
whether
--
since
congress
has
as
ssa
concedes,
waived
sovereign
immunity
in
a
405
(g)
case,
we
are
allowed
to
bring
an
action
under
or
our
award
below
is
authorized
by
405
(g).
ssa
says
that
we
can't
rely
on
that
because
we
failed
to
exhaust
the
administrative
remedy
provided
in
that
section.
this
court
just
today
in
the
wiesenfeld
case,
page
5,
note
8
has
cited
and
relied
upon
previous
cases
which
assumed
or
hold
that
it
is
unnecessary
to
exhaust
this
or
any
other
administrative
remedy
where
the
sole
issues
are
constitutional
or
where
the
administrative
remedy
which
the
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
well,
your
honor
the
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
they
stipulated
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
constitutional
issues.
they
have
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
right.
they
have
no
more
authority
in
this
case.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
well,
they
stipulated
that
it
would
be
futile,
yes
your
honor.
it
would
be
equally
futile
here.
let
me
--
we
did
not
exhaust
the
administrative
remedies.
but
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
no
your
honor,
we
do
not,
not
at
all.
but
let
me
just
a
moment
talk
about
what
happened
in
this
case.
we
didn't
exhaust
the
administrative
remedy,
but
somebody
else
did.
somebody
in
our
class
took
our
pleadings,
put
them
into
the
--
to
an
admin
--
our
pleadings
in
the
district
court,
put
them
into
the
administrative
hearing
officer.
the
administrating
hearing
officer
said,
“you're
talking
about
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute.
we
have
no
authority
to
decide
that
matter”
and
the
secretary
of
hew
affirmed
that
decision,
that
is
right
in
the
record
in
this
case.
so
as
far
as
we
can
tell,
there
is
no
question
that
the
exhaustion
would
have
been
futile
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
we
believe
that
it
is
justifiable
under
405
(g).
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
no.
we
believe
that
as
in
wiesenfeld,
we
were
entitled
to
bring
it
under
1331
or
under
a
number
of
other
statutes
upon
which
we
rely.
we
brought
--
we
believed
that
it
can
be
affirmed
under
any
of
a
number
of
statutes.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
these
back
benefits,
we
believe
that
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
in
our
position
your
honor
is
that
it
is
either
of
two
things.
either
one,
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
allows
us
to
bring
a
suit
under
1331
or
any
other
source
of
jurisdiction
limited
to
the
social
security
act
or
two,
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
allows
us
to
bring
a
suit
under
405
(g)
and
--
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
well,
that
would
include
1331
your
honor.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
and
that's
what
wiesenfeld
was
brought
under.
and
that
would
be
jurisdictional
so
--
as
it
is
--
as
its
considered
in
the
opinion
of
this
court,
and
this
court
didn't
dare
consider
it
was
a
jurisdictional
defect.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
very
well
your
honor.
now,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
here
that
somehow
the
60-day
statute
of
limitations
in
405
(g)
would
apply
to
our
class
and
it
somehow,
the
members
of
the
class
avoided
this
or
tried
to
avoid
this
60-day
statute
of
limitations.
well,
i
note
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
i
shall
attempt
briefly
to
summarize
if
i
may.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
no,
we
have
not
covered
this
point
in
our
brief.
mr.
don
b.
kates,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
60-day
statute
of
limitation
is
tied
very
strictly
to
the
exhaustion
requirement.
that's
what
it
grows
out
of.
if
the
exhaustion
requirement
is
inapplicable,
the
60-day
statute
of
limitations
is
inapplicable.
the
application
of
that
60-day
statute
of
limitations
works
a
very
substantial
injustice
to
our
class
as
well.
this
class
members
are
ordinary
citizens
who
rely
upon
ssa
for
eligibility
information,
information
which
is
its
duty
to
provide
to
them.
when
these
people,
the
vast
majority
of
whom
are
not
constitutional
lawyers
are
told
that
they're
flatly
ineligible
because
of
this
statue,
they're
not
going
to
rush
off
and
file
a
suit
in
united
states
district
court.
they
just
assume
in
justifiable
reliance
upon
the
information
they've
given
that
they're
ineligible.
having
been
misled
by
ssa,
misled
in
good
faith,
but
misled
nonetheless,
the
statute
of
limitation
should
be
considered
tolled
until
60
days
after
these
people
have
now
been
notified
of
their
entitlement.
thank
you
very
much.
