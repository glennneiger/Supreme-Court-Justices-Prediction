mrs.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
depend
to
some
extent
on
a
state
by
state
analysis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
there
some
states
in
which
the
stepfather
has
no
obligation
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kates.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
there
been
much
doubt
in
the
past
whether
they
could
get
the
money
back?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
there
been
much
doubt
in
the
past
that
they
could
get
the
money
back
in
your
hypothetical
or
your
illustration?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
fatally
over
broad
if
congress
eliminated
the
benefits
entirely
on
the
theory
that
they
didn't
want
to
get
into
deciding
how
many
people
of
the
total
number
were
malefactors
as
you
put?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
these
circumstances?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yeah.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
simply
say
no
benefits
at
all.
no
question
that
they
can
do
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
no.
independent
of
the
remarriage,
just
eliminate
the
benefits
to
solve
the
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
definitely
over
breadth,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
you
say
is
that
they
can't
make
one,
they
can't
try
to
slice
it
as
thin
as
they
sliced
it
here
when
the
knife
cuts
some
innocent
people?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
covered
this
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
give
you

do
it
very
briefly.
