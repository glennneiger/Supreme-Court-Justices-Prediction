justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
number
is
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
pass
that
refers
to
the
water
rather
than
the
land,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
status
of
the
government
sketches
so
far
as
the
record
is
concerned,
were
they
admitted
in
evidence
or
are
concededly
just
illustrative?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
number
7
on
the
government's?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
in
itself
is
quite
unusual?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
master
ruled
against
louisiana
on
east
bay
the
juridical
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
argument
is
going
to
all
of
those
findings
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
do
you
say
that
we
can
offset
the
master's
finding
just
by
looking
at
that
map
and
kind
of
getting
the
sense
of
whether
it's
a
bay
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
precisely
when
you
say
that
natural
entrance
points
to
a
bay?
are
you
talking
about
something
hiking
around
the
shore?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
enter
certainly
at
the
point
closes
to
shore
if
you're
entering
the
bay.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
would
hope
so.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
that
the
purpose
of
the
convention
to
enable
you
to
make
that
sort
of
a
definition?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
we
supposed
to
open
protractors
to
conference
on
friday
and
try
to
figure
this
thing
out
for
ourselves?
i
would
think
in
order
to
offset
the
special
master's
finding
on
this,
you
would
have
to
make
some
attack
other
than
you
know
we
do
it
a
little
differently.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
c
would
be
the
equivalent
of
the
low
water
part
base
and
venue
where
you
work
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
bay
is
this
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
two?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
they
meet
the
juridical
bay
requirements?
