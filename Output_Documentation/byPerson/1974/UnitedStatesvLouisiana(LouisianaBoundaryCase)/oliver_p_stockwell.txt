mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
now
before
the
court
to
determine
the
coastline
from
which
the
measure
of
three
geographical
miles
that
was
confirmed
to
louisiana
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
in
1969,
this
court
reaffirmed
it
prior
position
in
the
california
case
that
the
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
and
would
control
in
determining
this
coastline.
and
at
that
time,
they
report
--
they
re-appointed
a
special
master,
the
honorable
walter
p.
armstrong
and
referred
to
him
same
issues
to
be
determined
preliminarily
by
mr.
armstrong
and
report
back
to
the
court.
the
report
has
now
been
filed
with
this
court
and
exceptions
had
been
taken
both
by
louisiana
and
by
united
states.
the
first
exception
of
louisiana
deals
with
the
fact
that
the
special
master
failed
to
find
any
historical
inland
bays
along
louisiana's
coast.
the
master
first
written
a
preliminary
report
in
which
he
found
that
there
was
no
historic
inland
bays
and
to
that
report
we
filed
a
motion
to
ask
him
to
find
special
findings
of
fact
for
the
benefit
of
this
court.
since
he
had
said
that
the
evidence
on
louisiana's
historical
bay
claim
was
undisputed
and
the
appendix
1
to
our
brief
is
a
motion
that
we
file
with
the
special
master.
now,
that
resulted
in
the
special
master
making
16
special
findings
of
fact
which
were
attached
to
his
report
as
exhibit
b.
now,
these
findings
of
fact
were
made
after
the
special
master
had
already
determined
that
louisiana
had
no
inland
bays
along
its
coast.
as
we
read
the
special
master's
report,
he
is
saying
that
these
bays
along
louisiana's
coast
would
qualify
its
territorial
bays
and
not
as
inland
bays.
we
feel
that
--
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
as
territorial
bays,
historic
or
territorial
bays
and
not
inland
bays.
now,
we
feel
that
the
master
made
this
determination
or
the
origin
with
the
government
that
only
the
exclusion
of
innocent
passage
of
foreign
vessels
was
relevant
evidence
to
establish
historical
inland
waters
even
in
a
bay
and
we,
and
now
in
this
case,
before
this
court,
the
united
states
has
not
defended
that
statement
of
law
that
they
all
give
to
the
master.
they
are
saying
that
while
that
is
an
important
factor
that
there
are
other
relevant
evidence
that
would
show
that
these
waters
could
be
territorial
inland
waters.
and
we
say
that
these
facts
that
were
found
by
the
master
which
included
briefly
that
since
1870,
louisiana
had
been
passing
laws
regulating
oyster
fishing
along
its
coast.
in
1886,
louisiana
passed
legislation
reaffirming
it
titled
in
all
these
bays
which
was
shown
on
all
the
published
maps
and
this
title
were
reaffirmed
subsequent
legislation.
louisiana,
though
the
master
found
that
since
1900,
louisiana
had
been
leasing
part
of
these
bays
for
oyster
fishing.
and
in
the
early
1900s,
louisiana
had
been
enforcing
its
game
and
fishing
laws
in
these
bays
and
using
as
a
line
to
demark
these
bays,
the
outermost
mud
lump
or
other
feature
marked
in
to
see
what
inference
into
these
bays
and
three-mile
seaward
from
that
line.
and
they
were
treating
these
bays
as
inland
waters.
they
were
patrolled
by
armed
vessels
with
armed
personnel.
they
required
anybody
fishing
on
these
bays
to
buy
licenses
from
louisiana.
and
evidence
shows
that
mexicans,
spanish,
and
various
other
foreign
nationals
purchased
licenses
to
fish
in
these
bays.
and
they
also,
the
master
found
that
louisiana
had
closed
seasons.
and
that
these
foreign
national
recognized
louisiana's
closed
seasons.
in
1946,
the
master
found
that
louisiana
arrested
mexicans
in
these
bays
and
the
arrest
was
made
more
than
three
miles
from
the
--
any
territorial
three-mile
sea
within
these
bays.
the
louisiana
started
leasing
these
bays
for
oil
and
gas
in
1928.
louisiana
past
pollution
law
in
the
1930s
and
it
enforced
these
laws.
and
louisiana
has
exercised
and
claimed
jurisdiction
over
these
bays
from
the
time
it
was
admitted
in
the
state
in
1812
to
the
present
time.
now,
and
also
the
united
states
has
taken
an
interest
in
these
bays.
around
the
delta,
there
was
a
turnout
of
game
reservation
created
by
president
theodore
roosevelt
in
1907
and
that
was
before
you
had
it
in
migratory
game
laws.
now
we
say,
that
this
evidence
--
this
evidence
clearly
indicates
that
louisiana
was
asserting
to
the
world
by
this
legislative
act
and
the
other
acts
that
it
was
claiming
these
bays
as
inland
water.
the
master
found
that
louisiana's
title
to
these
bays
had
never
been
questioned
by
the
united
states
in
1948.
and
in
this
court,
in
its
brief,
the
united
states
now
admits
that
it
has
questioned
louisiana's
title
to
caillou
bay
as
inland
waters
up
till
1968.
and
if
this
court
accepts
the
master's
headlands
for
line
e
in
east
bay,
then
the
waters
in
east
bay
would
have
been
a
juridical
bay
to
1956.
now,
we
say
that
the
fact
that
the
government
now
has
not
defended
this
position
that
you
have
to
have
direct
evidence
of
preventing
innocent
passage
into
these
bays,
that
a
legal
principle
that
they
now
see
is
what
we've
all
get
all
along
but
you
could
show
these
acts
against
foreigners
to
show
that
this
water
was
and
inland
bay.
now
also,
we
are
ordered
to
this
court
and
we
feel
that
that
jurisprudence
supports
it.
the
way
you
have
an
indentation,
like
a
bay
and
you
exercise
jurisdiction
and
dominion
over
that
bay
and
establish
it
as
the
historic
bay
that
it
automatically
become
an
inland
bay.
now
under
article
of
geneva
convention
where
they
deal
with
historic
base
and
say
that
it's
an
exception
to
rules.
it
has
provided
that
any
waters
land
whether
they
are
closing
line
is
inland
waters.
dr.
bloom
in
his
book
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
discusses
this
very
issue
and
says,
that
there's
no
distinction
between
the
waters
behind
the
closing
line
in
a
juridical
bay
than
there
is
in
a
historic
bay.
now,
we
feel
like
that
one
of
the
issue
that
the
united
states
discussed
is
been
urged
before
the
special
master
was
that
you
have
to
have
acquiescence
of
funds
to
these
acts
of
foreign
governments
to
these
acts.
now,
in
this
court
they
don't
defend
that
legal
principle.
they
say
that
you
don't
have
to
have
acquiescence
and
another
issue
in
the
before
that
master
was
the
burden
of
proof.
they
introduced
evidence
showing
that
the
united
states
had
purported
this
claim
in
a
historic
bays
along
louisiana's
coast.
all
of
those
acts
were
after
1940
when
louisiana's
title
had
already
ripened
as
we
see
by
these
past
acts.
and
anything
that
was
done
after
that
as
this
court
has
said
could
not
dispossess
louisiana
of
its
title
because
it
would
be
an
impermissible
contraction
of
territory.
so
this
evidence
was
introduced
before
the
master
to
urge
that
we
have
to
prove
our
title
of
this
waters
which
we
have
treated
as
inland
waters
from
the
initial
statehood
of
beyond
the
doubt
which
is
almost
the
same
evident
you
need
to
have
in
a
criminal
case.
now,
in
this
court,
they
don't
defend
that
principle.
they
say
that
now
you
don't
have
to
have
that
burden
of
proof.
now,
we
feel
like
that
in
the
united
states
also
before
the
special
master
that
there
were
no
waters
along
the
louisiana
coast
that
would
one
time
inland
waters
that
would
not
now
satisfy
the
juridical
tests.
now,
of
course
that's
not
true
now
because
they
admit
that
each
bay
at
one
time
was
a
juridical
bay
to
its
outermost
headland
in
1918
which
should
be
the
line
e,
and
also
admit
that
caillou
bay
was
inland
waters.
now,
they
will
making
that
argument
to
the
court,
to
the
master
to
keep
them,
from
have
to
decide,
having
decide
whether
louisiana
tied
had
already
been
vested
by
past
events
whether
or
not
the
government
could
dispossess
louisiana
of
that
type.
and
we
say
that
where
these
bays
had
been
inland
bays
and
recognized
as
inland
bays
by
the
united
states
until
after
the
submerged
lands
act,
they
remained
inland
bays.
now,
they
argue
to
that
the
fact
that
these
bays
are
once
inland
bays
are
the
waters
for
inland
waters
that
that
shouldn't
be
was
in
no
importance
and
determine
the
historical
chart
of
this
bays.
even
though
louisiana
showed
that
it
exercised
enough
jurisdiction
(inaudible)
prior
to
the
east
bay
ceasing
the
beach
bays
if
they
have
already
don't
bit
the
test
and
as
continued
to
exercise
that
authority.
they
say
that
immediately,
if
they
open
a
bay
immediately
would
lose
its
juridical
characteristics.
say
you
had
a
slight
change
in
the
headland
or
slight
change
in
the
water
area
that
the
count
--
that
united
states
will
lose
thousand
of
acres
of
land
and
you
could
not
acquire
that
as
a
juridical
--
a
historical
bay
to
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
and
dominion
for
a
period
normally
to
acquire
historical
title
whether
you
had
any
prior
inland
waters
or
not?
now,
we
say
that
that
--
certainly
that
has
no
basis
for
that.
it
shown
no
area
in
the
world
where
you've
had
bays
that
had
been
treated
as
inland
bays
to
now
open
sea.
and
they
also,
and
mr.
miller
who
represented
united
states
at
the
head
conference
in
1930
urged
that
where
waters
were
once
on
the
dominion
of
the
state
as
inland
waters
and
you
remained
and
you
kept
jurisdiction
of
them
that
they
remained
inland
waters.
and
this
was
in
keeping
with
the
arbitration
keys
between
norway
and
sweden
and
the
grisbadarna
case
where
they
say
that
a
state
of
facts
that
have
long
existed.
in
international
law,
they
are
disturbed
very
little
and
we
say
that
it
doesn't
affect
the
emulatory
of
question
of
the
coastline.
the
emulatory
feature
of
the
coastline
is
primarily
relates
to
that
part
of
the
coastline
that
is
indirect
contact
with
the
sea.
this
is
changed
by
erosion
and
accretion.
but
when
you
have
large
bodies
of
waters
such
as
bays
and
straits,
that
this
--
that
principle
doesn't
necessarily
apply.
now,
we
head
back
to
brushiet
(ph)
for
the
netherlands
and
testify
in
this
case
and
that
was
his
opinion.
the
united
states
argues
that
if
they
would
adopt
the
evidence
that
we
have
introduced
in
an
international
court
that
an
international
court
would
not
say
this
to
inland
waters.
we
had
back
to
brushiet
(ph)
come
over
here
and
he
listened
to
all
the
evidence
and
we
profound
it
to
him
a
hypothetical
question
similar
to
the
evidence
in
exhibit
e
that
the
master
found
and
asking
what
an
international
court
would
determine
the
waters
of
which
these
acts
have
been
taken
and
he
said
there
would
be
internal
waters
under
the
regime
of
historic
bays.
now,
we
feel
that
his
opinion
should
have
consideration
by
this
court.
he
is
a
recognized
authority
of
which
this
court
has
recognized
a
massive
authority.
the
same
--
so
we
feel
that
louisiana
has
proven
that
these
bays
are
historical
inland
waters
and
that
therefore
the
closing
line
of
the
bays
should
be
as
louisiana
has
indicated.
there's
no
dispute
as
we
understand
between
the
government
as
to
the
closing
lines
if
this
court
will
hold
that
the
bays
of
the
delta.
now
the
only
bays
that
are
involved,
mr.
justice
white
you
have
that
map
is
around
the
delta
and
at
caillou
bay.
now,
these
are
the
bays
that
we
see
are
historical
bays.
at
this
time,
unless
you
have
some
question,
i'd
like
to
ask
mr.
ellis
to
talk
on
the
juridical
question.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
in
connection
with
the
question
of
justice
blackmun,
i
think
the
united
states
recognize
just
east
bay
and
delaware
bay
as
historical
bays.
in
addition
to
long
island
sound
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
oliver.
p.
stockwell
i
think
they
do
now.
yes.
but
i
think
before
that
they
were
recognized
before
they
had
the
24-mile
closing
line.
they
were
recognized
as
historical
bays.
now,
as
far
as
long
island
sound
is
concerned,
the
united
states
through
the
state
department
furnished
information
to
mr.
griswold
to
enter
interrogatories
in
their
alaska
case
instead
there
were
some
question
about
whether
long
island
sound
was
a
historic
bay
and
later
mr.
meek
wrote
mr.
griswold
to
correct
those
answers
and
said
he
had
found
out
that
there
had
been
an
agreement
between
new
york
and
one
of
its
adjacent
states
fixing
a
boundary
in
the
bay
which
was
approved
by
the
united
states
and
therefore
they
considered
it
a
historical
bay
and
said
it
was
no
question
of
any
dispute
about.
that
was
the
only
thing
he
has
said
about.
they
didn't
say
anything
about
jurisdiction
and
physical
dominion
or
not.
it
all
automatically
became
historical
bay.
so,
we
feel
that
with
the
long
history
of
action,
the
louisiana's
take
along
these
bays,
along
its
course
and
that
there've
been
no
--
even
though
the
state
--
united
states
says
evidence
is
not
all
that
clear
but
the
master
found
that
they
had
enforce
this
laws.
now
when
they
talk
about
the
fishing,
there's
a
reason
case
filed
with
this
court
54
original
in
which
the
united
states
filed
a
suit
against
texas
and
florida
to
enjoin
texas
and
florida
from
enforcing
each
fishing
laws
more
than
three
miles
from
the
coastline.
this
suit
is
pending
now.
in
other
words
in
and
the
united
states
recognize
in
that
court
--
in
that
case
that
they
permitted
foreign
nationals
to
fish
three
miles
beyond
its
coastline
and
if
the
states
had
no
right
to
prohibit
the
foreigners
from
doing
that.
now
of
course
we
recognize
in
66,
congress
passed
an
act
creating
a
12-mile
fishing
zone.
we
recognize
it
had
a
convention
on
the
sea
of
natural
resources
same
time
it
had
a
conventional
or
territorial
sea
in
continuous
zone.
but
we
are
talking
about
in
1948
when
louisiana
said
its
title
was
vested
by
the
historical
acts.
there
was
no
permission
to
fish
beyond
the
three-mile
territorial
sea.
and
it
was
in
louisiana
enforce
those
rules
within
its
bay
that
they
were
setting
jurisdiction
against
foreign
nationals
beyond
the
territory
sea.
and
certainly
would
be
acts
to
establish
historical
waters.
now
mr.
claiborne
didn't
discuss
the
fact
that
these
bays
were
recognized
at
one
time
as
inland
bays.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
special
master
in
east
bay,
he
found
that
the
line
e
that
you
saw
on
mr.
claiborne's
map
and
the
line
b
that
all
of
the
requirements
of
article
vii
of
the
convention.
but
he
said
that
it
did
not
meet
the
semicircle
test
when
you
use
his
rigid
water
measure.
but
the
master
realized
he
was
wrong
so
he
found
those
lines
and
said
to
the
court
that
you
might
take
it
more
liberal
few
water
bays
and
if
you
do
these
lines
meet
objectively
those
depths.
and
we
say
that
under
the
convention
in
the
prior
ruling
of
this
court,
(inaudible)
case
that
the
court
should
take
and
include
the
waters
of
the
streams
that
attribute
to
the
bay.
now,
this
exhibit
that
the
government
put
which
was
(inaudible)
they
entirely
put
the
(inaudible).
it
doesn't
show
all
of
the
waters
entering
east
bay
from
south
pass.
it
doesn't
show
the
waters
in
the
bay
from
southwest
pass
or
none
of
the
johnson
buyer.
of
course,
all
of
that
makes
a
difference
when
you
look
at
that
b
to
see
if
you
can
find
headlands
or
you
can
consider
water
area.
now
you
have
--
the
maps
that
are
in
the
record,
even
the
maps
that
the
court
attach
to
its
opinion
shows
of
all
realistic
view
of
east
bay.
now
mr.
armstrong
gave
considerable
attention
to
this
case.
he
gave
as
all
pertinent
time
and
he
worked
and
listened
to
all
the
evidence
and
on
all
of
these
points,
these
headland
points,
there
was
extensive
evidence
only.
there
was
--
it
located
them
with
exploit
testimony
and
we
say
that
what
the
government
is
attempting
to
do
and
louisiana
is
not
attempting
to
do,
we
are
not
trying
to
upset
its
finding
in
fact.
we
say
legally
and
he
realized
that
was
a
legal
question
as
whether
or
not
he
used
the
proper
area
bays
and
if
you
disagreed
with
him,
he
had
fixed
these
lines.
now,
he
did
the
same
in
caillou
bay.
he
said
that
he
realize
that
in
the
including
of
this
court
in
prior
briefs
there
were
some
question
of
whether
it
was
admitted
that
these
islands
were
not
assimilated
to
the
mainland.
but
he
said
that
if
from
the
evidence
in
this
case
was
produced
before
him,
then
he
would
say
that
caillou
bay
was
a
juridical
bay
that
it
met
all
of
the
tests
and
the
rigid
tests
that
he
set
down
with
reference
to
the
assimilation
of
these
islands
to
the
headland.
now,
there's
a
difference
between
assimilating
islands
for
headland
purposes
and
islands
in
a
bay
to
be
considered
water
area.
the
fact
that
islands
are
in
a
bay
might
be
assimilated
to
the
mainland.
it
doesn't
make
them
nevertheless
an
island
for
the
purpose
of
water
bay
because
in
a
bay
it's
considered
that
that
whole
area
is
territory.
in
other
words,
there's
no
difference
between
the
land
and
the
water.
now,
the
simulation
of
an
island
for
headland
is
a
question
there
whether
this
island
is
assimilated
to
the
land.
now,
whether
an
island
is
an
actual
island
in
the
bay,
or
whether
you'd
see
that
island
is
assimilated
to
the
bay
and
then
you
could
use
it
for
water
that's
not
the
test.
that
test
only
applies
when
you
use
an
island
as
a
headland
for
the
bay.
now
that's
what
mr.
claiborne
was
arguing.
now,
we
say
your
honors
that
we
feel
that
louisiana
has
adequately
proved
all
of
these
waters
of
being
historical
waters.
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear.
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
treat
louisiana's
fishery.
all
we
want
is
what
the
facts
of
this
case
in
the
law
would
give
us.
we
realize
that
this
is
an
important
case
and
a
decision
that
this
court
makes
on
these
issues
of
historic
bays
and
on
other
issues
dealing
with
the
convention
are
going
to
be
precedence
in
these
other
cases
and
in
international
law
and
we
say
that
the
court
--
we
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
case
carefully
and
resist
the
effort
of
the
united
states
in
trying
to
restrict
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
thank
you
gentlemen.
