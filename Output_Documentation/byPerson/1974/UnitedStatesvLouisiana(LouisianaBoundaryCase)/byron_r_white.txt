is
that
the
joseph
bayou
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
authority
do
you
have
that
acquiescence
in
some
form
is
essential?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
if
it's
just
a
debate
about
words,
you
wouldn't
insist
in
that
acquiescence
is
necessary.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
foreign
government
hasn't
invaded
louisiana,
it
would
be
enough
to
show
acquiescence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
those
bays
are
within
east
bay?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
there
may
be
a
bay
within
a
bay?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
bay
in
which
it's
a
bay
and
which
the
one
bay
occurs
isn't
a
juridical
bay?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
concede
that
somewhere
up
in
the
--
would
you
concede
to
be
on
that
line
of
bay?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice

(voice

the
water
is
something
quite
different?
that's
when
the
inland
rules
the
road
takeover
and
so
on
and
it
has
nothing
to
with
bays.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
did
hunt
for
headlands,
apparently?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
so
but
he
didn't
just
say
well,
at
any
point
along
the
smooth
coastline,
i
can
mark
the
beginning
of
the
day
just
because
that's
where
the
bay
satisfies
the
semicircle
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

of
the
convention
aren't
you
that
for
this
definition.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
special
master
rejected
louisiana's
arbitrary
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
purported
to
follow
your
rules.
you
may
just
disagree
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
the
master
--
assuming
the
master
is
correct
in
the
point
besides
they
then
the
parties
are
in
the
brief,
worth
25
or
24
miles.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
line
exists
at
all,
you
say
there
is
no
bay
at
all.
