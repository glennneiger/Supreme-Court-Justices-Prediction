mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
alright.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
addressing
the
juridical
problems
of
whether
particular
bays
along
the
louisiana
coast
qualify
as
bays
and
whether
the
limits
are
located
as
contended
for
by
louisiana
or
as
contended
by
the
united
states.
the
principle
legal
authority
involved
is
article
vii
of
the
geneva
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
which
this
court
and
as
1969,
louisiana
boundary
decision
held
must
be
applied
to
the
louisiana
coast.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
i
understand
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
was
put
before
you
by
the
united
states
and
we're
satisfied
it's
correct,
sir.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes,
sir.
they
are
also
explanatory
details
concerning
the
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes.
they
had
marked
for
example.
there's
one
little
detail,
the
coastguard
line
that
shows
an
extensive
water
area.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
runs
outward
to
see
considerably
that
is
no
long
and
controversy.
originally,
there
was
20
million
acres
in
controversy
in
the
case.
it's
now
been
reduced
to
approximately
258,000
acres.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
the
areas
in
controversy
are
the
mississippi
delta
areas
numbered
1,
4,
5,
and
6
and
caillou
bay
numbered
7
which
are
affected
by
the
historic
claims
and
the
remaining
areas
numbered
on
the
map
or
affected
by
juridical
claims.
additionally,
much
of
the
area
affected
by
historical
claims
is
affected
by
juridical
claims.
for
example,
east
bay
numbered
1
on
the
map
is
the
subject
of
both
historic
and
juridical
claims.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
now
turning
to
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes,
sir,
the
east
stays
behind.
this
shows
the
historic
bay
closure
at
the
artificial
entrance
point
and
this
shows
line
a
employing
the
outermost
extension
of
the
natural
land
form
at
the
base
of
the
jetties
on
the
headline,
the
pronounced
headline
at
southwest
pass.
incidentally,
this
court
in
its
1969,
pardon
me,
its
1966
decree
in
the
california
case
in
passing
upon
headland
questions
noted
that
where
there
is
a
pronounced
headland
the
natural
entrance
point
would
be
selected
by
use
in
the
outermost
extension
of
the
pronounced
headland.
we
have
fundamentally
three
kinds
of
problems
in
the
bay
areas
in
controversy.
related
to
the
elements
of
the
bay
definition
which
your
honors
can
find
in
appendix
a
to
the
united
states
brief,
the
original
brief.
article
vii
requires
that
a
bay
be
a
well
mapped
indentation
with
such
penetration
in
proportion
to
with
the
mouth
as
to
contain
land
luck
waters
and
constitute
more
than
a
mere
curvature
of
the
coast.
additionally,
it
requires
a
semicircle
test.
we
maintain
that
they
are
basically
three
elements
involved.
one
the
well-marked
element
which
relates
to
the
identifiable
headland
requirement
this
court
required
in
1969.
secondly,
the
landlocked
element
governed
by
depth
of
penetration
in
relation
with
the
mouth,
which
is
the
(inaudible)
landlocked
of
mere
curvature.
at
ascension
bay,
the
first
of
the
geographic
areas
in
controversy,
the
controversy
turns
principally
around
the
landlocked
issue.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
this
is
number
2,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
your
honors
may
find
this
bay
also
in
a
map
which
was
prepared
to
implement
your
ruling
that
island
should
be
counted
as
water
area
figure
r.a.
in
louisiana's
reply
brief
found
at
page
58,
which
map
has
superimposed
upon
it
in
black
lines
a
sketch
showing
the
outline
of
monterey
bay.
monterey
bay
is
a
bay
along
the
california
coast
which
this
court
decided
in
1965
was
well-marked
was
landlocked,
it
had
identifiable
headlands.
now,
the
court
decided
in
1969
that
islands
within
an
indentation
should
be
counted
as
part
of
the
area
of
the
indentation,
even
accepting
government
arguments
that
to
be
counted
what
area
had
to
be
part
of
the
area
of
the
indentation.
the
court
referred
to
the
master
then
two
issues,
the
well-marked
question
and
the
landlocked
question.
during
the
testimony
in
this
case,
dr.
hodson,
the
geographer
of
the
department
of
state
testified
that
ascension
bay
was
well-marked.
his
disagreement
with
the
bay
be
in
accepted
as
in
closed
in
in-lock
waters
was
based
solely
upon
the
landlocked
issue.
however,
as
we
demonstrate
it
to
the
special
master
by
comparison
to
the
monterey
bay
map
by
mathematical
data
by
measurement
experts,
geomorphological
experts.
as
we
demonstrate
it
by
comparison
to
mare
ferd
(ph)
by
comparison
to
egmont
bay
by
comparison
to
bays
that
dr.
hodson
himself
had
recognized
along
the
coast
of
alaska,
this
bay
was
by
any
comparison
subjectively
or
objectively
landlocked.
for
example,
it
had
a
depth
of
penetration
50%
greater
than
the
depth
of
penetration
ratio
of
monterey
bay.
it's
rather
interesting
to
note
in
this
louisiana
environ
that
bays
are
formed
by
the
natural
bank
or
natural
levee
systems
of
the
mississippi
river
or
its
distributors
or
its
former
causes.
at
this
locale,
it
is
the
former
cause
of
the
mississippi
by
first
on
the
left
or
the
west
side
of
the
drawing
the
mississippi
on
the
right
was
southwest
pass
which
forms
the
pronounced
headlines
which
were
marked
the
indentation.
turning
to
east
bay,
similar
land
forms
(voice
overlap).
this
is
east
bay
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
that
is
number
1,
your
honor
on
the
government
location
map.
it
is
immediately
to
the
east
of
ascension
bay.
we
have
again
this
pronounced
tedlin
(ph)
falls.
dr.
hodson
incidentally,
in
his
testimony
he
recognized
that
this
land
and
he
was
--
is
the
geographer
of
the
department
of
state
that
this
land
forms
were
indeed
headlands
that
they
were
indeed
identifiable
headlands
that
they
were
indeed
identifiable
headlands.
his
only
quarrel
with
the
headlands
that
were
--
that
they
did
not
relate
to
this
bay
but
related
to
pocket
bays.
we
demonstrated
however
by
an
objective
test
that
he
said
should
control
over
his
own
opinion
that
it
satisfied
this
object
test
and
consequently,
we
also
satisfied
the
master
on
that
point
as
well
as
using
a
number
of
other
technical
test
which
satisfied
him
fully
at
all
of
the
alternative
line
claims
of
louisiana.
the
master
found
that
each
of
the
alternative
juridical
claims
within
this
bay
was
well
marked,
was
landlocked
and
clearly
identifiable
headlands.
he
required
actually
a
steeper
burden
of
proof
than
this
court
asks
for
when
it
required
that
they
be
identifiable
headlands
and
he
found
they
were
all
clearly
identifiable
by
use
of
the
technical
tests
photographs,
over
flights
and
a
mass
of
map
data
and
information.
there's
no
time
to
cover
the
various
alternative
contentions
which
were
thoroughly
considered
by
the
master
in
this
area.
the
principle
problem
here
turns
on
area
measurement
--
area
measurement
under
the
semicircle
test.
it
is
louisiana's
contention
that
the
latter
in
spirit
of
article
vii
should
be
followed
in
requiring
that
the
area
for
the
semicircle
tests
be
measured
by
following
the
low
water
line
and
additionally
that
islands
within
the
indentation
be
counted
as
part
of
the
area.
this
is
consistent
with
the
ruling
of
an
imminent
british
trial
jurist
who
considered
the
same
problem
in
the
thames
estuary
which
like
this
area
contains
title
streams,
title
rivers,
and
he
held
that
the
history
of
the
convention,
the
letter
of
it
required
that
every
stream,
every
river
become
it
and
be
counted
all
of
it.
and
he
found
that
the
line
in
controversy,
they
are
satisfied
the
semicircle
test
by
so
doing
this.
we
submit
that
the
president
of
the
british
decision
in
these
thames
estuary
case
is
very
well-reason
and
should
be
followed
by
this
court
also.
the
only
substantial
question
then
is
whether
he
was
correct
when
he
decided
that
tributary
waters
should
be
excluded.
the
government
withdraw
a
distinction
and
say
well
some
tributary
waters
should
be
excluded
and
other
should
not.
this
is
a
change
in
a
formal
position.
they
would
say,
well
perhaps
rivers
or
streams
should
not
be
included
in
area
measurements.
let
us
note
right
now
that
we
do
not
in
any
of
the
measurements
submitted
by
experts,
the
mathematics
of
which
incidentally
were
not
challenged
at
all.
we
do
not
claim
any
part
of
the
mississippi
river
passes.
these
passes
as
part
of
the
area
measured.
the
system,
our
technical
expert
recommended
was
to
use
the
tributary
waters
to
the
point
where
they
cease
to
be
tributary
to
this
bay.
the
passes
were
tributary
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
thus
ad
absurdum
arguments
to
the
effect
that
one
could
by
the
system
go
to
canada
simply
have
no
application
under
the
recommendation
of
our
technical
expert,
dr.
james
p.
morgan.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes,
sir.
now,
generally
speaking,
pass
means
southwest
pass,
for
example
would
be
the
water
but
this
term
is
sometimes
also
applied
to
the
natural
bank
or
natural
levee
system
that
bounds
the
land
so
that
i
am
not
referring
to
southwest
pass
water
bound
in
this
bay,
i
am
referring
to
the
southwest
pass
natural
levee
bound
in
a
well
mark
in
east
bay.
incidentally,
this
problem
should
be
distinguished
in
this
area
of
county
and
islands
from
problems
of
headland
selection
in
connection
with
islands.
you
will
hear
the
government
contend
that
islands
with
an
indentation
should
not
be
counted
because
they
should
be
treated
as
part
of
the
mainland.
we
would
direct
this
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
when
it
decided
that
islands
may
be
realistically
treated
as
part
of
the
mainland
that
this
was
done
after
considering
that
the
convention
language
did
not
deal
with
the
problem.
but
in
this
instance,
the
convention
language
is
explicit
and
it
is
not
a
merely
a
matter
of
technical
language,
it
is
a
matter
of
the
spirit
and
of
the
reason
for
the
rule
for
there
is
explicit
legislative
history.
for
example
we
have
an
appendix,
appendix
1
where
we
deal
with
the
international
law
commission
history
among
many,
many
other
items
in
that
technical
appendix
where
we
point
out
that
mr.
fransua,
the
repertoire
mentioned
that
of
the
international
law
commission
whose
work
led
to
the
geneva
convention
mentioned
that
the
rule
require
islands
to
be
counted
as
part
of
the
area
of
the
indentation
did
so
because
of
the
fact
that
the
islands
tended
to
link
the
area
with
the
land
more.
this
is
a
reason
for
count
in
and
being
liberal
in
the
question
of
area
measurement
not
a
reason
for
being
restrictive
in
the
method
of
area
measurement.
similarly,
islands
at
the
mouth
of
the
bays,
they
found
that
these
tends
to
link
the
water
with
the
landmark
and
the
more
one
links
to
water
with
the
land,
the
more
reason
there
is
to
treat
it
as
inland
water
and
this
is
just
antithetical
to
the
government
notion
that
would
assimilate
islands
to
the
mainland
for
purposes
of
water
measurement
under
the
semicircle
test.
turning
to
the
other
major
category
of
problems,
island
headland
problems
--
oh!
but
before
discussing
those,
let
me
point
out
one
other
problem.
we
have
in
the
sketches
presented
to
this
court
which
the
government
would
have
the
court
rely
upon
instead
of
the
massive
large
scale
maps
and
other
technical
evidence
presented
to
the
master.
numerous
errors
and
deficiencies
which
we
feel
we
must
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
unless,
the
government
position
go
unanswered
that
one
can
form
an
opinion
on
the
basis
of
these
mass
sketches,
for
example,
at
south
pass,
the
government
sketches
leave
off
the
islands
that
form
the
tip
of
line
a.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
they
were
not
admitted
in
evidence
as
appreciate
they're
merely
illustrative.
similarly,
in
the
illustration
however
there
are
to
patch
this
from
the
evidence
because
we
had
in
the
(inaudible),
this
land
form
area
here.
considerable
evidence
of
the
land
deteriorating
until
at
which
they
condition
like
this
map
which
is
submitted
as
illustration
only
but
is
a
published
map
of
the
united
states
geological
survey
recently
published.
this
area
here
has
disintegrated
and
we
show
ample
photographs
for
example
at
page
82
of
our
opening
brief
and
following
to
show
this
state
of
deterioration
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes,
sir.
these
are
shown
at
close-up
photographs
at
page
82
and
83
and
these
math
made
with
the
hydrography
for
the
low
water
datum
in
hydrophy
includes
the
low
water
line
shows
that
this
area
is
substantially
identical
to
the
streams
and
island
situations
within
west
bay
which
i
am
finding
to
now
which
this
court
held
did
not
separate
riverside
bay,
zinzin
bay,
and
bob
taylor's
bond.
incidentally,
--
excuse
me
sir?
all
of
these
areas
were
accounted
as
part
of
the
outer
bay
ascension
bay
which
is
out
here
would
be
approximately
after
you.
and
the
court
held
that
these
were
islands
within
a
bay
and
that
they,
and
the
areas
covered
which
incidentally
include
streams
do
not
prevent
the
use
of
those
areas
as
part
of
the
area
of
the
bay.
we
feel
the
master
fell
on
to
error
of
a
legal
sort
in
connection
with
island
headland
problems
but
we
think
he
misinterpreted
the
court's
opinion
where
it
set
out
factors
for
determining
whether
islands
are
realistically
part
of
the
mainland
as
requiring
cumulative
rigid
tests
or
requirements
for
example
this
is
an
area
in
the
mississippi
delta
where
we
have
in
the
headland
situations
substantial
fluvial
conditions
for
example
at
southeast
pass
which
is
the
subject
matter
of
illustrations
in
the
appendix
numbered
1
to
our
opening
brief,
one
can
find
either

court's

for
these
highly
elevated
islands,
mud

they
are
found
at
a
very
short
distance
approximately
two
miles
from
the
mouth
of
(inaudible)
where
the
arrests
of
a
vessel,
a
private
herein
seizure
occurred
in
1806.
this
was
the
subject
of
the
british
admiralty
court
decision
diyana
(ph)
in
which
an
american
ambassador
appeared
in
the
british
court
and
made,
i
submit
in
historic
waters
or
historic
bay
claim
here
because
this
really,
this
court
found
itself
where
islands
were
an
extension
of
the
mainland
in
diyana
(ph)
and
these
are
almost
the
precisely
the
same
local,
we
have
a
geologist
testified
they
had
precisely
the
same
characteristics
as
the
any
facts
and
indeed
there's
some
reasons
to
suspect
that
they
may
even
be
the
very
same
islands
that
were
involved
in
diyana
(ph).
the
distances
involved
were
relatively
minor
but
very
significantly
as
this
exhibit
shows
that
was
less
than
a
foot
of
water
separating
these
islands
from
the
mainland.
this
is
typical
of
all
of
these
fluvial
islands
along
the
louisiana
coast.
the
very
exceedingly
shallow
waters
as
far
as
innocent
passages
concerned
for
example
in
this
area,
one
couldn't
get
one
of
our
local
pea
rows
through
this
area
when
we
need
an
airboat
to
get
through
these
areas.
the
only
kind
of
navigation
that
can
be
done
but
yet
the
depth
and
utility
of
the
intervening
waters
which
these
court
said
was
a
fact
that
have
to
be
considered
while
conceded
was
not
given
appropriate
weight
we
submit
by
the
special
master.
these
are
situated
on
extensions
of
the

ever
there
was

informed
just
as
the
mud
lumps
were
by
sediments
as
the
court
in
that
case
style
them
and
by
the
weight
of
sediments
of
thrusting
them.
the
distances
involved
are
minor.
if
one
examines

of
our
appendix

to
the
assimilation
of
violence
that
was

in

of
the
spanish
banks
by

morris
in
the
florida
matter

before
this
court.
turning
to
--
oh!
before
leaving
this
mississippi
delta
area,
i
wanted
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
this
illustration
from
material
in
the
record
that
shows
that
the
headland
--
this
is
the
example
of
the
kind
of
detail
we
went
through.
there's
much
more
of
all
of
these
other
areas
to.
but
where
we
show
that
the
--
this
was
the
outermost
extension
of
the
natural
form
in
19
--
natural
land
form
in
1901.
the
headland
used
for
line
a
on
the
west
and
that
overtime
we
trace
it
for
here
example.
the
jetty
that
was
left
of
the
government's
sketch
is
shown
on
this
reproduction
of
the
chart
of
that
period
and
line
a
strikes
that
jetty
out
of
space
showing
it's
the
terminus
of
the
natural
land
which
we
selected
as
the
natural
entrance
point.
now,
this
shows
it
on
a
more
modern
map.
in
the
caillou
bay
region,
area
number
7,
again
we
have
an
example
of
fluvial
islands.
islands
which
were
the
subject
of
geomorphological
testimony
to
the
effect
that
they
are
the
remnants
of
a
form
of
delta
of
the
mississippi
river.
they
had
formally
been
solidly
connected
to
the
mainland.

you
can

maps
in

etcetera.
in
the
last
century,
this
island
was
solidly
connected
to
the
mainland.
it
was
really
peninsula.
the
master
incidentally
rule
with
us
here
that
he
on
the
basis
of
even
a
strict
test,
he
took
to
apply
in
the
court's
standards
that
he
found
that
this
island
situation
post
a
situation
where
the
island
should
be
treated
realistically
as
part
of
the
mainland.
he
felt
deterred
by
this
court's
footnote
comment
that
we
have
not
urged
this
ourselves
and
that
the
court
did
not
think
so.
but
of
course
the
court
at
that
time
did
not
have
a
full
record
before
it,
did
not
a
evident
--
this
is
the
very
reason
this
court
appointed
a
master
was
to
discover
such
information
as
the
fact
that
these
fluvial
islands
as
testified
to
by
a
government
geologist,
even
where
he
found
mainland
most
deposits
on
these
islands.
the
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
caillou
bay?
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
caillou
lake
is
in
the
interior
part
and
i
believe
it
is
landlocked
completely
except
for
an
entrance
to
it
sir.
this
is
the
1853
map,
perhaps
you
are
referring
to
in
figure
42?
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes.
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
there
are
two
distinct
water
bodies
caillou
lake
and
caillou
bay.
mr.
frederick
w.

and
caillou

is
virtually
completely
landlocked
as
you
have
observed
your
honor.
caillou

was
opened
at
its
mouth.
these
depths
in
this
bay
incidentally
which
forms
a

the
government
points
to
and
claim
this
is
a
situation
rather
like
sta.
barbara
channel,
i
believe
you
here.
depths
of

law
or
in
the
channel
or
in
excess
of
a
hundred
fathoms
range
up
to
1200

and
more,
600
to
1200
feet.
depths
here
on
either
side
of
the
whole
that
the
government
points
to
as
deep
channel
but
it's
merely
a
whole
one
sounding
as
23
feet
between
this
on
hold
less
than
5-foot,
a
vessel
drawn
more
than
5-foot
of
water
could
not
navigate
through
here.
in
this
area
for
example,
these
largest
of
the
island
opens,
i
see
your
honors,
in
location
c
here,
the
water
depth
is
less
than
a
foot
as
the
picture
in
the
record
of
myself
and
my
daughter
i've
had
taken
by
technical
witness
is
hang
up
on
with
a
20-foot
mercury
outboard
motor
cannot
navigate
a
small
becto,
cannot
navigate
through
these
openings.
turning
to
the
size
considerations
which
the
master
deemed
important,
he
found
this
fact
here
that
we
have
islands
that
on
hold
and
your
honors
can
see
this
a
larger,
a
greater
in
distance
than
the
water
gap
openings
and
data
is
not
needed,
it's
quite
evident
graphically.
we
feel
the
foot
“no
comment”
was
perhaps
occasioned
by
the
graphics
of
the
government
brief
which
showed
an
extremely
small
scale
sketch.
we
have
tried
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
that
small
scale
sketches
can
be
misleading
accidentally
and
that
it
is
necessary
to
concede
as
the
convention
requires
the
large
scale
charts.
we
incidentally
have
a
great
many
other
arguments
that
selectivity
of
time
needs
have
required
us
not
to
elaborate
upon
but
of
course
we
do
not
waive
them
as
such
as
the
chart
matters
where
we
maintain
that
cahoon
(ph)
island
for
line
c
which
the
master
found
existed
until
1969
that
this
should
control.
we
insist
on
these
arguments
and
merely
imagine
this
so
that
it
will
not
be
misunderstood
that
we
are
waiving
any
of
these
claims.
incidentally,
a
number
of
the
headland
claims
are
supported
independently
by
the
application
of
ordinary
headland
rules
as
well
as
island
assimilation
rules,
it
will
be
recalled
this
court
mentioned
in
passing
that
rules
for
headlands
applied
to
islands
and
we
have
a
number
of
headland
rules
that
are
applicable.
for
example
in
the
islands
at
southeast
pass
we
look
at
which
are
substantially
similar
to
other
islands
in
the
mississippi
delta
that
are
claimed
as
bay
headlands
and
we
haven't
argued
all
of
these
locations
and
interests
of
time.
they
found
the
apex
of
the
salient
which
are
the
natural
banks
of
the
rivers
here.
some
of
these
other
islands
our
a
good
deal
closer
than
the
southeast
pass
mud
lumps
to
each
which
i've
directed
your
attention
particularly
as
the
bucket
bend
bay
where
they're
very,
very
close.
others
are
most
distant
as
that
pass
the
loop
but
all
of
them
have
this
unique
fluvial
character
present
in
this
mississippi
river
delta,
a
very,
very
shallow
waters
the
deepest
water
found
between
the
islands
in
the
mississippi
delta
its
water
of
four
feet
and
this
is
at
pass
elute.
generally,
the
water
between
the
islands
is
less
than
one
foot
mere
inches
a
child,
a
five-year-old
child
could
walk
out
these
islands,
that
is
how
shallow
the
water
is
and
incidentally,
out
at
the
exterior
headland
islands
that
were
claimed
in
the
land
that
is
very
substantial
and
firm
because
you
receive
sands
there
but
in
the
interior
portion,
in
the
joseph
bayou
area,
the
land
in
here
is
very,
very
insubstantial,
very
mushy
due
to
the
differences
in
the
geologic
conditions
associated
with
this.
they
--
this
area
has
become
nothing
but
mere
spoiled
bank
remnants
which
we
maintain
ought
to
be
treated
technically
as
what
they
are
islands.
in
this
caillou
bay
area,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
the
principle
water
gap
there
involved
caillou
bay,
dr.
hodson
admitted
in
his
testimony
was
england
in
character.
as
indeed,
i
believe
the
government
recognized
is
that
caillou
bay
is
inland
waters
which
is
--
mr.
frederick
w.
ellis
yes,
and
this
is
number
7
on
the
government
map
and
it
is
the
open
marked
a
here.
you
see
it
forms
the
boundary
of
the
lake
pelto
which
has
been
recognized
by
the
government
by
this
court
hereto
for
to.
and
actually
caillou
bay,
the
(inaudible)
the
same
island
it
was
all
one
island
at
one
time,
fronts
like
pelto
also
are
recognized
body
of
england
water
adjoining
it.
in
closing,
let
me
mention
that
the
errors
we
point
to
in
the
special
master's
report
are
almost
exclusively
errors
of
law.
a
question
of
the
correct
method
for
applying
the
semicircle
test,
a
question
of,
did
he
require
the
correct
standard
of
proof
when
he
required
that
headlands
be
clearly
identifiable,
not
merely
identifiable,
but
clearly
identifiable.
did
he
require,
apply
the
correct
rule
when
he
converted
we
submit
this
court's
mere
fact
as
mere
considerations
to
use
the
word
of
this
court
into
cumulative
rigid
requirements
if
you
miss
one
of
them
even
if
you
have
this
tremendous
fluvial
characteristics
we
have
here
which
this
court
felt
important
enough
to
talk
about
the
pages
in
its
opinion.
if
even
in
the
face
of
this,
if
one
fact
a
size
or
distance
is
not
present
as
he
did
in
the
case
of
some
of
these
mud
lump
islands,
he
denies
that
uses
headlands.
we
submit
this
was
a
misinterpretation
legally
of
the
courts.
on
the
contrary,
the
government's
position
whether
the
government
would
ask
to
reverse
the
special
master's
report
as
on
headland
matters,
landlocked,
well-marked
matters
at
ascension
bay
and
that
east
bay
where
the
master
rule
first
the
government
ask
this
court
to
substitute
his
judgment
on
essentially
factual
questions
not
pointing
effectively
we
think
to
any
error
of
law
upon
which
his
reasoning
was
grounded.
thank
you.
