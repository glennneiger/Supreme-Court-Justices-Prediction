mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
i'll
attempt
to
deal
first
with
louisiana's
historic
claim.
i
approached
it
in
this
way
and
i
suggest
it
proper
for
the
court
to
approach
with
a
bias
against
finding
historic
inland
wateres.
i
say
that
because
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
presumption
against
such
historic
waters
that
do
not
conform
to
the
rules
of
international
law
or
the
rules
of
the
convention.
to
find
the
historic
bay
where
there
is
no
juridical
bay,
obviously
encroaches
on
the
first
principle
of
maritime
law
which
is
freedom
of
navigation,
freedom
of
the
seas.
secondly,
it
derogates
from
the
rules
of
international
convention
which
tell
us
how
to
define
a
bay
if
every
time
an
area
which
look
like
a
bay
did
not
satisfy
the
technical
criteria
established
by
the
international
convention.
it
could
be
claimed
as
historic
waters,
the
convention
would
become
a
dead
letter.
it
would
serve
no
purpose.
one
must
be
hesitant,
one
must
be
reluctant
to
find
a
bay
where
the
rules
of
the
convention
say
there
is
no.
thirdly,
to
find
historic
waters
on
the
american
coast
contradicts
the
consistent
and
very
long-standing
tradition
of
american
foreign
policy
which
is
to
view
restrictively,
narrowly
claims
into
the
ocean.
that
has
been
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
its
foreign
relations
ever
since
the
days
of
thomas
jefferson.
and
finally,
in
this
particular
areas,
east
bay
and
the
rest,
it
is
of
course
relevant
that
the
united
states
has
taken
the
position
that
this
are
not
historic
waters
and
its
taking
that
position
not
for
the
purpose
of
this
litigation
solely
but
quite
consistently
in
its
international
stands
which
the
view
to
foreign
relations.
there
can
be
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
government
has
taken
one
position
where
oil
is
involved
and
a
different
position
where
international
relations
are
involved.
at
all
stages
of
this
case,
the
justice
department
and
the
state
department
had
been
consultation
and
have
found
a
uniform
position
and
indeed
the
position
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
i
may
say
perhaps
i
shouldn't
that
we
have
sometimes
in
the
position
of
having
devout
to
the
geographer
the
state
of
element.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
only
to
this
extent
mr.
justice
stewart
that
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
court
took
note
of
the
federal
disclaimer
and
gave
it
weight.
in
the
california
case,
it
was
said
that
such
a
disclaimer
would
be
conclusive
in
the
absence
of
overwhelming
proof,
that's
such
a
claim
had
arrived.
and
let
me
say
straight
away
that
notwithstanding
all
i've
said
about
a
presumption
against
historic
waters,
we
recognize
as
we
must
in
line
of
the
court's
opinion
in
this
very
case
in
1969.
that
if
historic
title
had
ripened
to
any
of
these
areas
before
a
federal
disclaimer
was
made
and
we
take
that
to
mean
before
1948
when
the
first
of
these
suits
was
filed
then
it
would
be
good
title
but
one
must
be
hesitant
to
make
such
a
finding
not
only
because
of
the
encroachment
on
american
foreign
policy.
the
awkward
situation
that
would
result
in
having
this
court
say
this
is
a
bay,
the
state
department
saying
it
isn't
even
water.
but
the
international
considerations
which
view
historic
waters
as
an
exception
and
my
opponents
were
free
to
say
that
this
was
an
exception
as
the
normal
rules
of
article
vii
and
i
think
they
must
be
right
in
this
respect.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
simply
wouldn't
say
there
will
be
a
bias
against
louisianans,
justice
stewart.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
suppose
the
normal
rules
of
construction
would
say
that
when
the
claim
is
attaches
itself
to
an
exception
to
the
rule
the
--
that
exception
ought
to
be
construed
narrowly.
now,
perhaps
that's
a
different
way
of
saying
that
there's
a
presumption
against
findings
such
an
exception.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
no,
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
united
states
and
i
should
say
this
consistently
with
its
position
of
restricting
the
coastline
as
much
as
possible
of
limiting
the
encroachments
on
the
open
sea
recognizes
on
the
american
coast
no
historic
bay
whatever
with
the
single
exception
of
long
islands.
and
that
is
in
the
record
through
letters
from
the
legal
adviser
of
the
state
department
and
indeed
from
the
secretary
of
the
state,
the
attorney
general.
that
is
the
traditional
policy
of
the
united
states.
other
countries
take
different
views
but
here
we
are
talking
about
the
american
coast.
now,
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
tested
by
the
rules
of
international
convention
which
merely
recognized
in
article
vii
that
they
all
such
things
is
as
historic
base
without
attempting
to
define
them
presumably
because
of
lack
agreement
in
the
international
community
on
the
subject.
now,
bearing
in
mind
what
must
be
recognized
is
a
heavy
burden
if
only
because
of
the
federal
disclaimer
and
here
the
court
has
been
clear
that
the
disclaimer
puts
the
burden
on
the
state
claiming
the
historic
orders.
has
louisiana
proved
any
historic
title
to
this
bay
or
any
of
the
others
areas?
now,
this
court
has
already
said
there
are
three
elements
which
require
proof
as
to
each
of
which
the
state
has
the
burden.
the
first
is
that
there
has
been
an
exercise
of
authority
over
the
area
which
indicates
a
claim
to
that
area
as
inland
water
not
as
territorial
water
but
as
inland
water.
my
opponent
said
that
the
master
had
found
that
east
bay
was
a
historic
territorial
bay.
now,
that
is
simply
not
the
fact.
on
the
contrary,
the
master
explicitly
found
that
issue
the
other
way.
he
discussed
whether
louisiana's
evidence
was
consistent
with
the
use
of
the
waters
as
territorial
waters
that
being
of
course
a
three-mile
territorial
belt.
he
also
adverted
to
the
possibility
that
one
could
obtain
territorial
water
title
to
an
extended
belt
but
his
conclusion
and
that
conclusion
is
quite
explicit
is
that
the
issue
which
had
been
presented
by
louisiana
is
there
a
territorial,
are
there
territorial
waters
in
this
bay?
he
said,
the
answer
is
no.
now,
that
is
a
perfectly
clear
when
one
looks
at
the
report,
page
56,
the
paragraph
6
says
from
south
pass
to
southwest
pass
east
bay.
sub-paragraph
e
--
i
got
the
wrong,
page
56,
i'm
sorry.
i
was
--
does
this
area
include
--
and
this
is
paragraph
e
on
page
56.
does
this
area
include
any
historic
territorial
waters
under
principal's
of
international
law
particularly
at
(inaudible)
east
bay
always
bay
and
if
so
what
is
the
effect.
he
answered
that
question
and
that
is
issue
1-e
on
page
22
of
his
report
when
he
said
the
special
master
has
constrained
to
make
some
of
the
finding
in
instant
case
and
therefore
issues
1-d
--
1-e
and
so
forth
must
be
in
the
negative.
now,
we
come
to
the
second
element
which
is
the
continuity
of
the
exercise
of
authority
over
the
waters
indicating
that
england
character
which
according
from
the
u.n.
publication
juridical
regime
which
this
court
invoke
in
its
last
opinion
must
be
so
long
continued
as
to
have
developed
into
a
usage.
and
finally,
and
very
important
is
the
acquiescence
of
foreign
nations.
i
heard
it
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
united
states
had
taken
the
view
that
acquiescence
was
not
necessary.
what
we
have
said
is
this,
acquiescence
is
necessary
but
it
may
be
explicit,
expressed
or
it
may
be
tacit.
obviously,
if
the
evidence
were
that
foreign
governments
had
over
a
long
period
of
time
been
notified
of
the
claim
to
inland
water
and
had
taken
no
action,
made
no
protest
and
had
obeyed
the
restrictions
imposed,
we
would
concede
even
though
they
had
been
nothing
expressed
that
this
amounted
to
acquiescence.
it
would
be
tacit
i
guess.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
authority
cited
by
this
court
in
its
last
opinion
indicate
that
either
expressed
acquiescence
or
absence
of
protest
is
important
when
absence
of
protest
is
discussed
it
is
in
the
context
of
having
noticed
and
we
simply
refer
to
that
situation
of
not
protesting
when
you
had
long
notice
as
amounting
to
tacit
acquiescence.
it
seems
to
us
to
be
a
debate
about
words
and
not
a
real
debate
whether
one
says
no
pro
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
except
that
i
would
insist
mr.
justice
white
that
absence
of
protest
alone
is
not
sufficient.
one
must
show
that
the
foreign
government
had
repeated
and
over
a
long
period
notice
of
the
claim.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
be
enough
if
a
foreign
government
had
been
notified
over
a
long
period
that
louisiana
was
claiming
a
space
inland
waters
and
had
failed
to
protest
that
situation
provided
further
that
they
had
some
interest
in
doing
so.
well,
one
can't
draw
a
conclusion
if
there's
no
reason
to
go
into
his
bay.
now
what
is
the
evidence
that
louisiana
has
presented
to
come
to?
i
think
it's
fair
to
boil
it
down
to
rarely
two
claims.
the
first
is
that
over
some
period
it
has
exercised
fishing
regulation
within
this
bay
and
perhaps
some
adjacent
areas
including
in
that
oystering
and
shrimping.
and
secondly,
it
invokes
its
mineral
exploration
and
leasing
in
east
bay
and
caillou
bay.
now,
when
we
get
down
to
looking
at
that
evidence,
what
do
we
find?
with
respect
to
fishing
first,
any
fishing
or
fishing
regulation
or
exclusion
of
foreign
vessels
within
the
three-mile
territorial
sea
proves
absolutely
nothing
relevant
to
this
case.
because
as
a
matter
of
international
law,
it's
always
had
been
the
prerogative
of
the
coastal
state
to
exclude
foreign
fisherman
within
that
territorial
sea,
or
to
regulate
foreign
vessels
or
to
require
them
to
take
out
licenses
and
pay
a
fee.
indeed,
even
as
a
matter
of
domestic
law,
it
has
always
been
the
prerogative
of
the
states
within
constitutional
limitations
only
which
has
to
say
the
commerce
clause
and
the
privileges
and
immunity's
clause
to
regulate
fishing
within
that
marginal
belt
of
three
miles.
and
even
the
california
case
which
said
the
states
they
would
own
the
belt
did
not
take
away
from
them
the
right
to
regulate
fishing
provided
it
was
done
in
a
none
discriminatory
way
vis-Ã -vis
of
the
u.s.
citizens.
and
indeed,
the
court
so
held
in
toomer
and
witsell.
of
course
since
1953,
the
submerged
lands
act
has
clearly
confirmed
the
rights
of
the
states
to
regulate
fishing
within
this
three-mile
belt.
so
nothing
can
be
made
of
the
activities
of
within
the
three
miles.
beyond
three
miles,
it's
of
course
settled
by
early
decision
of
this
court's
(inaudible)
versus
florida
that
regulation
with
respect
to
its
own
citizens
indicates
no
claim.
now,
what
about
regulation
of
foreign
fishing
or
exclusion
of
foreign
fishing
beyond
three
miles?
even
that
may
amount
to
no
more
than
the
claim
of
a
wider
territorial
season
three
miles
and
indeed
during
all
of
this
period,
louisiana
was
claiming
a
much
wider
territorial
sea.
it
was
27
miles
between
1938
and
1954
and
it
was
nine
miles
between
1954
and
1960
when
this
court's
decision
came
down.
and
as
a
matter
of
international
law,
one
is
free
under
the
convention
to
claim
its
matches
12
miles
which
would
eat
up
all
of
the
area
of
east
bay
if
one
took
12
miles
from
each
side.
the
basic
opening
is
approximately
18
miles
wide
of
east
bay.
now,
alternatively,
regulation
of
foreign
shipping
or
foreign
shrimping
or
fishing
or
exclusion
of
their
boats
beyond
three
miles
may
amount
to
no
more
than
the
claim
of
the
contiguous
fishery
zone.
beyond
the
territorial
sea,
very
far
from
a
claim
of
england
water
that
is
precisely
what
the
united
states
did
in
1966
back
to
congress.
it
claims
a
nine-mile
zone
within
which
it
can
exclude
foreign
fishing
or
regulate
it
or
both.
and
other
nations
throughout
the
world
had
the
same.
indeed,
in
the
1960
opinion
of
this
court
in
this
case,
the
court
noted
that
for
fishing
among
other
purposes,
nations
had
for
hundreds
of
years
created
belts
of
jurisdiction
of
the
coast.
and
the
court
referred
in
that
case
to
a
tabulation
which
should
have
been
made
during
the
senate
hearings
in
1951
in
reference
to
the
submerged
lands
act
legislation.
i
have
lodged
with
the
clerk
for
the
information
of
the
court,
should
the
details
be
of
interest
three-year
tabulations
of
claims
made
in
the
world
community
of
fishing
zones
that
exceed
the
territorial
sea.
one
is
from
the
senate
hearings
to
which
the
court
itself
referred
in
1960
opinion.
one
is
from
the
1960
addition
of
shalowitz
which
has
been
referred
to
by
the
court
and
the
parties.
and
the
last
is
the
most
recent
state
department
of
publication
published
in
1974
which
incidentally
shows
that
no
less
than
36
nations
have
fisher
zones
either
excluding
foreign
fishing
or
conservationers
which
go
well
beyond
the
territorial
sea
and
which
obviously
not
intended
to
imply
any
claim
to
inland
waters,
indeed
not
even
to
territorial
waters.
i
conclude
therefore
that
the
fisheries
regulation
would
indicate
no
claim
to
inland
water
here.
and
that's
on
the
assumption
that
there's
some
real
evidence
about
it.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
we
have
a
series
of
acts
of
the
legislature
entirely
inconsistent
and
contradictory
some
placing
a
three-mile
belt
within
this
bay
everywhere
else.
some
on
18-foot
long
and
all
three
fathom
line
which
is
always
within
landward
of
the
three-mile
belt
in
this
bay
to
east.
and
some
of
them,
apparently
claiming
east
bay
on
what's
called
the
point
to
point
basis
between
the
two
levels.
the
evidence
as
to
the
way
in
which
the
statutes
was
actually
implemented
is
also
most
ambiguous.
first,
we
know
that
no
lease
was
ever
granted
more
than
three
miles
from
shore.
as
to
fishing
and
shrimping,
there
is
evidence
that
for
broken
periods,
there
was
a
patrol
that
ran
from
one
ended
the
southwest
jetties
to
the
end
of
the
south
past
jetties.
but
it's
perfectly
clear
that
that
was
not
a
consistent
practice.
what
it
meant
even
when
it
was
used
is
not
clear.
at
times,
the
18-foot
line
or
the
three-mile
line
were
used
instead.
so
we
have
fall
from
a
long
continued
consistent
usage
developed
on
the
issue
of
enforcement,
even
assuming
that
such
a
policy
would
prove
a
claim
to
inland
waters.
as
to
the
exclusion
of
foreign
fisherman,
when
you
look
at
the
depositions
on
which
those
allegations
submit,
you
discover
that
most
of
them
in
fact
live
locally
for
all
we
know
citizens
in
any
event
seemed
to
have
been
from
that
residence
of
louisiana.
and
the
notion
that
their
acquiescence
in
this
fishing
license
regulations
got
back
to
china
or
japan
or
spain
or
the
philippines
is
most
unreal.
anyway,
they
agreed
to
by
the
$5.00
fishing
license
or
shrimping
license
and
it
turns
out
when
one
looks
at
the
record.
the
place
they
seem
to
wanted
to
fish
most
was
calhoun
reef
which
is
very
close
to
shore
and
whether
they
bought
it
three
miles
out
of
six
miles
act
not
that
little
to
them
the
interesting
ground
for
shrimping
was
calhoun
reef.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
they're
in
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
believe
they're
in
feet,
mr.
justice
stewart,
if
that
is
a
composite
base
now
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
series
1200
shots
of
which
they
are
many
of
them
in
the
record
are
in
feet,
not
in
fathoms.
and
18-fathom
land
in
--
this
one
does.
well,
i
stand
corrected
but
the
1200
charts
which
we
have
if
you
show
them
in
feet.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
which
is
what
this
is?
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
says
so.
this
is
the
1200
series
chart
and
it's
soundings
in
feet
at
maine
land
water
in
feet.
and
the
18
fathom
line
--
the
18
foot
line
in
shown
very
clearly.
and
as
i
represent
to
the
court
always
well
within
three
miles
from
the
shore
of
this
bay.
and
i
don't,
i'm
not
clear
where
it
might
be
elsewhere.
now,
perhaps
i
ought
to
turn
to
the
claim
base
on
mineral
exploration
that
can
be
dealt
with
quite
shortly.
i've
had
nothing
about
it
this
morning
but
louisiana's
brief
makes
much
of
a
lease
granted
in
1928
which
can
be
construed
as
covering
all
of
east
bay
and
all
west
bay
and
a
great
deal
more.
it
is
clear
in
the
record
that
the
only
map
accompanying
or
relevant
to
this
lease
which
is
in
fact
a
release
they
did
in
1937
shows
that
the
oil
company
to
whom
the
lease
at
that
time
been
assigned
found
unusable
and
therefore
release
any
portion
of
beyond
the
certain
boundary
and
that
boundary
happens
to
be
pretty
much
the
three-mile
limit.
well,
inside
of
it
at
places
generally
following
it.
it
is
therefore
perfectly
clear
that
there
never
was
any
exploration
much
less
any
production
from
any
lease
granted
by
the
state
in
east
bay
before
1947.
and
indeed
when
the
case
was
last
here,
louisiana
dated
its
claim
based
on
exploration
from
1947,
only
in
this
proceeding
has
that
been
changed.
by
1947,
of
course
president
truman
had
claimed
for
the
country
the
entire
continental
shelf
and
other
nations
seeing
operations
more
than
three
miles
from
shore
would
not
have
cared
or
known
whether
this
was
done
under
the
provident,
presidential
proclamation
or
because
louisiana
treated
the
waters
as
inland.
it's
also
relevant
that
as
soon
as
that
drilling
began
in
1947,
the
united
states
filed
suit
against
louisiana
and
has
consistently
challenged
those
operations
indeed
the
chapman
line
in
east
bay
which
was
meant
to
carryout
this
court's
decree
in
1950
follows
the
three-mile
--
follows
the
contour
of
the
coast
and
in
1956,
this
court
was
required
to
issue
an
injunction
against
louisiana
to
prevent
the
drilling
in
the
east
bay.
it
would
be
a
very
strange
army
if
by
acting
--
if
by
prolonging
this
lawsuit
for
so
long,
louisiana
were
to
be
able
to
establish
on
historic
claim
to
inland
water
in
east
bay
by
invoking
the
very
activities
which
have
always
been
in
dispute
since
1948.
now
on
the
historic
claim,
i
think
i
need
to
say
no
more.
it's
clear
that
there
are
no
unequivocal
actions
which
indicate
a
claim
to
these
waters
as
inland
rather
than
as
territorial
or
as
contiguous.
there
is
no
consistent
pattern
which
could
reasonably
be
called
the
usage
and
there
is
no
indication
whatever
that
any
foreign
nation
was
ever
notified
or
ever
had
come
to
its
notice
any
of
these
claims
that
louisiana
now
asserts.
in
those
circumstances,
the
absence
of
protest
is
meaningless.
we
therefore
think,
the
mass
are
quite
correctly
rejected
to
louisiana's
historic
claim.
i
turn
now
to
the
juridical
claims
advance
by
the
state
and
first
to
east
bay.
now,
we
take
what
is
characterize
this
is
simplistic
approach
here
and
suggest
that
you
look
at
this
area
without
any
lines
on
it
and
reach
an
impression
and
that's
all
these
matters
come
to
whether
this
qualifies
as
a
well-marked
indentation
in
closing
landlocked
waters.
i
think
one
has
to
note
first
the
general
shape
of
that
triangle.
the
bottom
of
it
is
so
wide,
so
open
to
the
sea,
it's
really
difficult
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
master
ruled
in
part
against
louisiana
on
the
juridical
claim
but
found
for
one
period
one
line
well
within
the
bay
and
for
another
period
a
second
line
further
within
the
bay
as
qualifying
as
a
juridical
claim.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
my
argument
goes
to
both
what
the
master
found
and
what
louisiana
suggest
he
should
have
found.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do
attack
the
master's
finding
of
part
of
east
bay
as
qualifying
as
a
juridical
bay
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
nobody
quite
simply
but
that
is
the
beginning.
the
master's
conclusion
is
not
based
on
any
technical
expertise.
there
is
no
way
technically
that
one
can
decide
such
a
matter.
and
when
one
looks
at
how
the
master
articulated
his
conclusion.
it
is
simply
one
that
i
think
that
line
encloses
landlocked
waters.
now,
i
will
say
that
i
think
the
master
started
from
the
wrong
premise
and
if
one
starts
from
the
right
premise,
i
don't
think
one
reaches
his
result.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
i'm
assuming
that
those
technical
requirements
have
been
satisfied
as
indeed
the
master
quite
properly
found
that
the
24-mile
rule
had
been
satisfied
and
it
was
respect
to
lines
c
and
d
which
he
thought
proper
the
semicircle
test
was
satisfied.
but
you
never
get
there
until
you
first
look
at
unmarked
map
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
and
decide.
well,
i
would
say
mr.
justice
stewart
you
do
it
this
way.
you
look
at
the
map.
you
say
to
yourself,
now
does
that
look
like
a
bay
or
arguably
vague.
it
may
be
in
the
case
of
this
bay,
the
answer
is
yes.
you
then
ask
yourself,
where
are
the
natural
entrance
points
to
that
bay?
and
this
court
itself
i
think
in
the
last
opinion
concluded
the
natural
entrance
points
all
the
tips
of
the
two
jetties.
that
seems
to
be
the
boundary
of
the
bay.
louisiana
makes
an
argument
about
that's
not
natural
because
it's
an
artificial
jetty
but
i
take
that
argument
to
have
been
foreclosed
by
the
previous
opinion.
it's
happens
that
once
you
test
that
full
bay,
under
the
semicircle
rule
it
doesn't
satisfy
this
court
so
found
in
1969.
now,
the
court
--
louisiana
said
last
time,
we
recognize
that
but
we
can
draw
a
line,
a
very
artificial
line
inside
which
will
satisfy
the
test.
this
court
responded,
âoh!
you
can't
go
back
that
way,
you've
got
to
find
that
there
is
a
geographic
bay
not
one
that
mathematically
satisfies
the
test.
we
follow
that
approach.â
the
court
said
there
may
be
a
bay,
a
narrow
one,
a
smaller
bay
within
the
east
bay.
we're
not
saying
there
is,
we're
not
saying
there
isn't.
the
master
i
think
misunderstood
or
at
least
you
seem
to
take
the
view
that
he
must
assume
that
there
was
a
bay
somewhere
in
there.
after
all
with
all
these
bay,
there
must
be
a
bay.
my
job
is
to
locate
it.
i
think
he
also
assumed
that
any
line
which
satisfied
the
semicircle
test
was
at
least
presumptively
good
enough
to
make
the
juridical
tests
of
the
convention.
now
,it
seems
to
us
that
that
was
going
about
it
backwards.
he
should've
first
said
to
himself,
now
if
the
whole
thing
doesn't
qualify,
is
there
in
fact
anything
else
that
is
a
separately
defined
bay
within
this.
and
when
you
look
at
the
two
shores
which
have
essentially
straight,
there's
nothing
that
jumps
at
you
as
the
natural
entrance
point
of
a
smaller
bay.
and
that's
not
surprising
because
when
you're
dealing
with
a
triangle
of
those
dimensions,
more
relevantly
with
an
angle
at
the
top
which
exceeds
65
degrees,
it's
mathematically
impossible
to
construct
an
interior
bay
that
would
satisfy
the
semicircle
test
if
it
were
a
perfect
triangle.
now,
of
course
east
bay
is
not
a
perfect
triangle.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
does
just
meant
to
indicate
that
the
73
relates
to
the
measurement
of
the
angle,
mr.
justice.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that's
the
degrees
of
angle.
the
formula
is
that
if
the
apex
of
the
triangle
exceeds
65
degrees,
no
way
can
you
draw
a
line
that
uses
that
same
angle
and
form
and
satisfy
the
semicircle
test.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
oh!
we
haven't
exhibited
both.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
indicate
it
mr.
justice
brennan.
its
will
within
but
i
wanted
the
court
to
look
at
the
map
unmarked
to
think
to
itself
where
would
we
put
that
line.
now,
the
master
said
he
didn't
go
about
it
that
way.
louisiana
suggested
to
him
among
many
these
two
lines.
the
united
states
said,
âwe
concede
to
those
lines,
meet
the
technical
semicircle
test
but
we
dispute
that
you'd
ever
found
them
if
they
hadn't
been
suggested
to
you.â
and
i
think
that's
the
way
it
ought
to
be
gone
about.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
for
a
period
in
tool
1969.
i
think
its
december
1969.
he
found
the
outer
line
which
is
the
straight
line
c.
he
found
that
thereafter,
the
anchor
for
line
c
on
the
east
which
is
labeled
calhoun
island
had
seize
to
exist
and
therefore
had
to
find
another
anchor
and
the
next
one
was
the
one
to
the
north
which
supports
line
d.
we
say
calhoun
island
didn't
exist
for
any
of
this
relevant
period
and
therefore
line
c
must
fall
on
that
ground
alone.
i
will
not
burden
the
court
with
the
reasons
of
why
we
think
the
evidence
does
not
support
calhoun
island
for
the
period
1950
to
the
present
and
will
rely
on
the
brief
for
that
proposition.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
those
are
not
natural
entrance
points
of
the
bay.
the
only
natural
entrance
points
of
any
body
of
water
within
that
general
area
of
this
bay
or
indeed
the
tips
of
the
jetty
or
with
respect
to
the
smaller
pocket
bays
which
we
numbered
one
through
five
which
we
fully
concede
are
proper
bays
but
which
had
happens
no
defect
to
three-mile
grant.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
those
bays
are
within
east
bay.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
indeed
we
don't
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed
mr.
justice
white.
our
point
is
this
that
this
coast
is
essentially
straight
and
that
to
pick
out
points
on
it,
is
artificial.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
it
so
happens
it
doesn't
affect
anything.
but
it
was
so
testified
by
the
geographer,
the
state
department.
he
drew
a
line
somewhere
about
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
first
we
concede
that
this
is
a
bay.
we
concede
that
there's
a
bay
in
here.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
concede
that
this
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
so
happens.
it
so
happens
that
they
do
not.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
one
must
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
mariner,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
who
is
entering
and
who
says
to
himself,
âi
am
now
within
inland
waters.
i've
left
the
open
sea.â
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
then
it's
perfectly
sure
that
one
might
more
logically
enter
at
the
center.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
in
this
case,
one
could
see
both
shores
of
the
distance
not
being
great
in
the
case
of
line
d.
but
(voice
overlap)
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
internal
waters
--
inland
waters
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
but
you
see
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
using
inland,
mr.
justice
stewart
in
the
sense
in
which
the
submerged
lands
act
uses
inland
or
internal
waters
in
the
sense
in
which
the
convention
uses
internal.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
this
court
has
used
the
term
inland
waters
as
the
grant
states
this
court
has
said
begins
at
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters
and
it's
that
use
of
inland
waters
that
i'm
talking
about.
and
for
that
purpose,
the
waters
within
the
juridical
bay
or
inland
waters
and
the
waters
outside
that
closing
line
even
though
within
the
inland
rules
of
the
road
are
not
inland
waters
for
the
purpose
of
this
case.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
would
say
that
one
has
to
be
able
to
determine
whether
it's
from
a
plane
or
a
ship
or
from
the
shore
that
one
has
seas
to
be
in
waters
that
appertained
the
open
sea
and
has
reached
waters
which
are
landlocked
which
are
internal,
which
are
defined
by
headlands
preferably
pinched
headlands
and
which
therefore
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
exactly.
the
convention
helps
this
and
that
it
tell
us
that
such
a
closing
line
must
be
between
natural
entrance
points.
it
tells
us
that
the
indentation
must
be
well-marked.
it
tells
us
that
the
line
must
be
such
as
to
enclose
landlocked
waters.
beyond
that,
the
convention
does
not
help
us.
we
must
use
our
own
judgment
in
interpreting
those
terms
and
applying
them
to
any
concrete
situation.
but
i
say
to
this
court
that
the
members
of
this
court
are
just
as
able
to
do
that
and
it's
done
on
a
flat
map
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
special
information
that
might
not
be
available.
one
just
looks
at
the
map
and
make
say
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
what
i
did
try
to
say
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
i
think
he
began
from
the
wrong
starting
point
followed
the
wrong
path
and
therefore
reached
the
wrong
result.
and
i
think
his
wrong
starting
point
was
assumed
that
his
job
was
to
find
a
bays
somewhere
within
this
bay
and
secondly,
to
presume
that
when
the
technical
semicircle
test
was
satisfied
one
indulge
the
kind
of
expectation
that
so
the
other
tests.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
whereas
this
court
had
very
clearly
said
you
begin
the
other
way
and
so
does
the
convention.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
conceded
headlands
just
the
two
of
them
is
more
fair
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
certainly
don't
wish
to
overstate
the
master's
decision.
of
course,
he
recognized
that
this
court
had
said
you
can't
draw
the
(inaudible)
lines
anywhere
which
merely
because
they
satisfied
the
semicircle
test.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
and
article
vii
begins
by
telling
you
what
is
a
bay?
and
then
as
a
second
check,
it
imposes
a
semicircle
tests
in
case
you
gotten
a
bad
impression.
but
you
must
first
find
the
bay
before
you
use
the
protractor.
you
never
get
to
the
protractor
until
you
found
what
looks
like
a
bay
and
what
is
not
merely
an
artificial
construction.
i
would
say
that
what
was
happened
in
this
case
is
that
louisiana
last
time
quite
candidly
said
we're
drawing
an
arbitrary
line
that
meets
a
semicircle
test
which
incident
they
--
i'd
like
to
show
you
just
to
show
you
where
it
was
and
this
time,
they
said,
âoh!
well,
we'll
have
to
get
little
pinpricks
on
either
side
out
to
support
that
artificial,
equally
artificial
lock.â
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
now,
it's
interesting
to
note
where
that
line
is.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
i
--
i
don't
know
about,
well
if
i
suppose
the
master
purported
to
follow
my
rule.
but
he
did
not
articulate
it
that
way.
he
said
let's
look
at
line
d
and
then
said,
âoh!
well,
he's
got
enough
of
a
headland
on
the
left
and
enough
of
the
headland
on
the
right.â
he
didn't
ever
say
to
himself,
now
is
there
really
any
bay
within
this
bay?
suppose
i
went
to
help
other
parties,
where
would
i
split
it?
i
point
out
that
the
1968
line
is
remarkably
inland
and
that
was
the
best
line
louisiana
could
find
in
1968
that
would
satisfy
the
semicircle
tests.
only
now
had
they
developed
a
news
rule
for
semicircle
measurement
and
talked
about
the
deterioration
of
(inaudible)
value
issues
that
were
perfectly
available
to
them
in
1968.
i
think
one
must
view
that
approach
with
some
guarded
suspicion.
the
other
lines
shown
on
this
last
overlay
all
louisiana's
various
suggestions,
the
most
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
d.
i
â-
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
it
would
appear
to
be
approximately
4-1/2
nautical
miles.
now,
cannot
in
the
little
time
remaining
go
through
of
various
objections
to
each
of
these
lines.
i'll
say
one
word
about
this
new
method
of
going
up
rivers
to
include
waters
so
as
to
satisfy
the
semicircle
test
with
lines
further
seaward
than
either
c
or
d.
united
states
concedes
that
c
and
d
meet
the
semicircle
test
properly
applied.
louisiana
would
have
you
overturn
the
master
in
this
respect
and
find
b
or
a
by
using
up
river
waters
first
invoking
an
english
decision
by
a
single
judge
who
was
not
affirmed
in
that
respect
that
english
court
of
appeal.
i
say
no
more
about
that.
and
secondly,
by
taking
notice
of
what
they
claim
to
be
deterioration
and
chosen
by
you,
a
matter
as
to
which
they
were
not
free
to
do
because
they
have
not
reserve
the
right
to
do
so
in
1969
when
they
stipulated
the
correctness
of
the
said
54
maps
which
is
before
this
court.
indeed
was
before
this
court
in
1968
and
which
in
any
event
isn't
sufficient
to
treat
all
of
that
land
area
as
water.
louisiana
waxes
hot
and
cold
about
water
islands
and
what
is
mainland
when
it
serves
their
purpose,
areas
very
far
detached
from
land
like
all
these
mud
lumps
are
treated
as
assimilable
to
the
mainland.
when
the
little
ribbons
of
water
separating
large
chunks
of
land,
they
somehow
become
true
islands
and
therefore
to
be
treated
as
water
the
semicircle
test
purposes.
i
think
it
will
be
transparent
to
the
court
that
that
inconsistency
cannot
prevail.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
there
has
indeed.
you
must
remember
mr.
justice
brennan
that
that
is
the
beginning
point
for
the
three-mile
belt
and
therefore
what
we're
talking
about
is
not
line
c
as
such
but
a
projection
three
miles
seaward
from
line
c.
that
would
be
the
award
to
louisiana
if
line
c
were
upheld
or
if
line
d
were
upheld.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed.
exactly.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
right
and
the
coastline
is
defined
either
as
the
low
water
line
the
long
and
open
coast
or
as
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters
in
a
bay.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
and
it's
only
the
latter.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
they're
all
issues.
our
second
exception
deals
with
the
existence
and
non-existence
of
an
extension
of
low
tide
area
of
(inaudible)
which
is
more
question
of
where
the
low
waterline
is.
i
do
not
argue
that
here
because
it
is
minor
issue
and
turns
more
on
the
facts.
i
had
best
get
to
ascension
bay
if
i
expect
to
say
anything
about
it
at
all.
here
again,
we
take
the
same
approach
that
is
we
suggest
the
court
that
the
proper
approach
is
one
of
looking
at
the
general
area
and
saying
to
oneself
now
is
this
a
bay
at
all?
here,
there's
no
question
about
which
part
of
it
is
a
bay.
the
question
is
whether
any
part
of
it
is
a
bay.
it
seems
to
us
that
we
have
here
a
half
moon
in
which
a
42-mile
opening
to
the
sea
with
no
possible
indication
of
where
the
open
sea
begins
and
where
inland
waters
or
internal
waters
or
the
bay
itself
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
--
begins.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
indeed,
number
two.
the
government's
chart,
the
louisiana
dislikes
the
use
of
small
scale
charts
gives
you
a
reasonable
impression
of
ascension
bay
as
compared
to
the
entire
coastline
and
whether
one
ought
to
view
it
as
more
realistically
part
of
the
sea
or
as
a
separate
landlocked
area.
we
say
that
it's
simply
not
landlocked.
now,
again
the
master
i
think
was
influenced
by
this
court's
finding
that
ascension
bay
met
the
semicircle
test
and
he
thought
that
was
a
gold
in
the
direction
of
saying
therefore
it's
probably
a
juridical
bay.
this
very
little
indication
how
he
reached
his
conclusion
because
he
did
it
all
in
three
sentences.
he
said
that
the
bay
had
well-marked
natural
entrance
points
but
was
very
reluctant
to
identify
them.
he
said
that
it
was
almost
perfectly
semi-circular
in
shape,
the
classic
shape
for
a
bay.
he
said
that
it
had
a
startling
resemblance
to
monterey
bay
which
this
court
had
found
to
be
a
bay
in
california
case.
now,
we
think
each
of
those
statements
is
false.
where
the
well-marked
entrance
point
on
the
west
is
--
baffles
me.
it
has
baffled
louisiana
who
shifted
it
about
to
several
places
and
it
has
baffled
the
master
who
has
chosen
one
and
said
there
may
be
many,
many
more
and
had
to
be
present
into
choosing
the
first
because
it
was
much
easier
to
leave
it
vague.
it
seems
to
us
one
can't
do
that
if
there's
a
will
marked
at
natural
entrance
point
unnecessary
predicate
for
a
bay.
it
ought
to
be
identifiable.
we
see
none.
the
two
possibilities
seem
to
be
one
that
bill
pass
jetties
the
louisiana
doesn't
use
the
jetties
because
they
are
not
natural.
they
are
artificially
made.
and
the
only
other
one
that
occurs
to
us
is
at
coming
out
of
past
both
ending
on
the
tip
of
southwest
jetty
which
does
indeed
look
like
a
well-marked
natural
entrance
point.
it's
the
problem
on
the
west
that
we
speak
of.
now,
it
does
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice
the
master
suggested
that
one
line
was
the
red
one.
he
suggested
there
may
be
others
not
telling
us
which
they
might
be.
we
presume
that
his
decision
is
based
on
the
red
line
though
he
was
--
let
me
hasten
to
say
the
reason
why
this
could
be
left
in
the
air
is
because
the
bay
being
over
large
the
rules
of
the
convention
require
that
a
24-mile
arbitrary
fall
back
line
be
drawn.
and
it
so
happens
that
that
fallback
line
and
the
parties
are
agreed
about
where
it
would
be
starts
here
and
go
somewhere
in
this
direction.
so
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
stop
there
or
there.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
entirely
right
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
nothing
remains
to
be
done
if
the
master
is
sustained.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
say
there
is
no
bay
and
we
say
that
because
the
point
on
the
west
which
has
been
chosen
if
it's
the
belle
pass
jetties.
it
doesn't
begin
to
define
that
inward
curve
is
one
would
expect
to
find
for
a
bay.
on
the
contrary,
it
comes
out.
it's
convex
not
concave.
it's
just
an
arbitrary
starting
point.
it
can't
be
seen
as
anything
else
so
we
submit.
now
the
other
point,
on
the
face
of
it,
it
seems
you
have
a
little
more
to
recommend
it
but
it
is
really
nothing
more
than
the
headland
for
coming
that
a
bay
is.
it
doesn't
advert
the
mariner
or
anyone
else
that's
there's
a
huge
bay
to
the
east.
it
tells
you
where
you're
about
to
go
in
to
a
bay
coming
out
of
bay
of
the
other
entrance
of
which
is
the
island
to
the
east.
actually
not
the
island
because
this
whole
complex
is
one
coming
out
of
bay
so
this
quite
obviously
a
bay
but
when
you
get
to
here
to
realize
that
is
huge
bay
to
your
right
is
not
realistic.
now,
the
master
also
said
it
was
almost
a
perfect
semicircle.
it's
that
close
but
substantially
incorrect.
if
one
draws
a
semicircle
on
either
of
these
lines,
one
notices
how
much
land
has
to
be
equal
into
before
the
semicircle
of
water
is
satisfied.
the
only
reason
the
bay
satisfies
the
semicircle
test
is
because
this
court
held
in
1969
that
these
waters
can
be
thrown
in.
but
in
terms
of
perfect
semicircles
is
all
of
this
of
land
--
this
all
of
this
of
land
showing
that
the
depth
is
not
even
but
of
a
semicircle.
now,
the
statement
that
a
semicircle
is
the
classic
form
of
a
bay
is
a
gross
exaggeration.
it
is
the
minimum
for
a
bay.
the
classic
form
of
a
bay
is
more
like
a
sea
shape
with
a
pincer
with
something
that
tells
you
that
you're
now
entering
internal
waters.
something
which
does
lack
the
waters
inside
the
closing
line,
there
is
nothing
here
which
makes
the
waters
on
one
side
of
the
line
more
landlocked
than
the
waters
on
the
other
side.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
would
say
to
meet
the
combined
test
of
having
a
well-marked
indentation
that
encloses
landlocked
waters.
when
one
puts
those
two
phrases
together,
i
think
one
expects
to
find
the
classical
form
at
least
would
be
a
pincer,
a
semicircle
will
satisfy
the
test
but
this
is
not
a
semicircle
because
it
does
not
even
come
in
on
the
west
as
a
semicircle
would.
now
when
it
compares
monterey
bay,
which
is
a
pincer
one
sees
what
a
classical
bay
does
indeed
look
like.
there's
no
question
whether
the
natural
entrance
points
of
monterey
bay
that
two
headlands
facing
each
other
and
the
waters
behind
the
line
connecting
them
quite
clearly
or
landlocked
waters
one
knows
that
one
is
within
a
bay
and
has
left
the
open
sea.
what
is
more
monterey
bay
is
only
19
miles
wide.
this
bay
is
42
miles
wide.
we
suggest
that
when
a
bay
is
over
large,
there's
all
the
more
reason
to
require
stronger
indications
that
each
one
has
left
the
open
sea.
one
can't
see
across
this
opening
therefore,
there
ought
to
be
stronger
pincers
to
cut-off
the
ocean
from
the
waters
inside
if
one
is
going
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
are
truly
inland
bay
waters.
i
have
time
for
one
word
with
respect
to
caillou
bay.
the
short
answer
there
is
that
this
court
has
already
resolved
that
issue
in
1969.
there
are
enough
issues
in
this
case
without
this
court's
is
being
tempted
to
accept
the
invitation
to
reconsider
that
ruling.
what
the
court
said
in
1969
was
that
neither
did
louisiana
claim
nor
was
it
affect
that
the
either
(inaudible)
were
assimilable
to
the
mainland
as
but
that
they
were
on
the
contrary
islands.
the
court's
other
holdings
which
were
that
islands
can
never
form
the
entrance
to
a
bay
and
that
you
don't
push
out
a
line
for
the
purpose
of
including
islands
unless
it's
a
bay
to
begin
with.
and
here,
it's
very
clear
no
bay
if
you
don't
anchor
it
on
the
islands.
this
area
would
never
qualify
as
a
bay
unless
when
you
use
this
as
a
closing
anchor.
now,
here
we
have
caluboka
(ph)
about
a
third
of
a
mile,
about
14
to
15-foot
depth
and
a
marked
channel,
a
clear
separation
from
the
mainland.
no
serious
debate
that
this
is
an
extension
of
the
mainland.
what's
more
as
i
say,
the
courts
already
resolve
the
issue.
louisiana
says,
all
but
the
united
states
until
1968
conceded
that
these
were
inland
waters
which
is
true.
the
court
in
1969
said
the
government
is
not
bound
by
that
concession
because
louisiana
has
suffered
no
prejudice
from
it.
on
the
contrary,
this
is
received
revenues
from
oil
exploration
to
which
it
may
not
have
been
entitled.
louisiana
says
we
were
prejudiced
because
this
area
wasn't
surveyed
as
carefully
as
it
might
have
been
if
that
had
been
an
issue.
but
the
years
that
have
passed
since
1968
and
the
present
have
offered
ample
opportunity
to
the
state
to
make
any
--
to
present
a
further
reference
if
they
were
useful
evidence
present.
they
did
not
even
reserve
the
right
to
do
so
when
they
stipulated
the
maps.
in
any
event,
they
haven't
done
so
and
the
new
evidence
doesn't
change
the
picture.
it
doesn't
narrow
the
gap
between
the
islands
and
the
mainland
relevant
gap
being
caluboka
(ph).
in
all
the
circumstances,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
master's
gratuitous
invitation
to
the
court
naturally
supported
louisiana
to
reconsider
it's
ruling
with
respect
to
caillou
bay
also
be
declined.
now,
i
have
sought
to
say
to
the
court
that
this
is
not
a
technical
matter.
and
that
the
court
ought
to
view
it
freely
without
being
burdened
with
the
suggestion
that
the
record
is
overwhelming
and
that
special
expertise
is
required.
i
suggest
the
master's
report
be
confirmed
in
all
respects
except
its
finding
at
east
bay,
its
finding
at
ascension
bay
and
its
finding
with
respect
to
posture
board.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
the
fact
mr.
justice
blackmun.
it
appears
in
two
ways.
first,
that
is
representation
of
both
the
legal
adviser
and
the
secretary
of
state
in
documents
on
file
in
this
case.
secondly,
it
appears
if
one
looks
at
the
charts
which
have
been
circulated
which
have
been
published
and
that
the
request
of
some
foreign
government
circulated
to
them
delineating
the
entire
three-mile
coast
of
the
united
states.
and
there
it
would
appear
that
long
island
sound
is
the
only
case
where
one
claims
a
bay
that
does
not
meet
the
juridical
test.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
that
is
the
answer,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
we
do
but
the
best
the
court
has
run
its
certiorari
in
that
case
and
we
do
not
acquiesce
in
the
ruling
of
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeal
in
the
alaska
case.
