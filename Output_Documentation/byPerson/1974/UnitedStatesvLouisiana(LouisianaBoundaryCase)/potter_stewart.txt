justice

mr.
ellis,
before
you
proceed,
may
i
ask,
am
i
correct
with
my
understanding
that
the
map
that's
been
put
before
us
this
morning
is
identical
to
the
map
that
was
the
appendix
to
the
court's
opinion
in
the
case
to
which
you
just
referred
in
1969?
justice
potter
stewart
that
it's
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
they
made
some
marks
and
red
here,
have
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
does
caillou
lake
completely
landlocked?
justice
potter
stewart
lake,
there's
a
lake
in
there,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i'm
looking
at
the
temporary
map.
i
also
have
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--old
map,
1853.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
does
this
say,
your
basic
theme
that
you're
at
the
outset
that
there
is
and
should
be
a
presumption
against
finding
historic
base,
is
that
--
did
you
find
any
support
for
that
and
in
any
of
the
opinions
of
this
court?
you
gave
us
four
reasons
to
support,
do
you
think
your
assertion
of
that,
that
is
your
presumption
but
is
there
any
support
for
that
in
either
in
the
louisiana
boundaries
case
or
in
the
united
states
against
california
or
anywhere
else
you
know
of?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
still,
all
of
that
still
does
not
add
up
to
their
being
a
bias
against
them
or
presumption
against
them,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
just
historic
bays?
that's
--
that
was
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
good
many
recognize
historic
bays,
aren't
there
in
the
--
along
the
coastlines
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
tested
by
the
rules
of
international
convention?
justice
potter
stewart
are
these
soundings
on
this
map
in
there
at
fathoms?
justice
potter
stewart
at
maine
low
water,
that's
what
they
generally
are?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
usual,
i'm
sure.
justice
potter
stewart
generally,
in
the
chart,
there
are
in
fathoms
in
maine
land
water.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
--
if
not
technical
at
least
it's
objective
and
measurable
isn't
it?
it's
a
semicircle
test
and
is
24
miles
north
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
now,
your
point
is
that
those
are
not
headlands
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
navigator
of
a
ship
has
no
ways
in
inland
waters,
that's
actually
the
coastguard
line.
justice
potter
stewart
anyone
has
nothing
to
do
whether
not
you're
not
in
a
bay?
justice
potter
stewart
inland
waters
has
a
term
of
our
having
to
do
with
the
rules
of
the
road
for
mares,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
you
are
in
a
bay.
whether
you
are
in
a
bay
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
are
many
inland
waters
--
there
are
inland
waters
many,
many
times
when
you
are
not
in
the
bay.
nobody
thinks
you
are
in
a
bay.
you're
still
in
inland
waters.
justice
potter
stewart
the
bays
whether
is
the
--
we're
now
trying
to
determine
the
coastline
and
louisiana
owns
three
nautical
miles
out
from
the
coastline.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
only
the
latter
that
causes
all
these
problems.
justice
potter
stewart
the
latter
part
of
the
depth.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
in
order
to
meet
the
initial
tests
of
a
well-marked
indentation
it
has
to
have
that
sort
of
configuration?
