justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
comes
to
us
by
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
district
court
--
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
securities
investor
protection
corporation
was
established
by
congress
for
the
purpose
of
providing
financial
relief
to
the
customers
of
failing
broker
dealers
with
whom
they
had
left
cash
or
securities
on
deposit.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
such
customers
have
an
implied
right
of
action
to
compel
the
corporation
to
exercise
its
statutory
authority
for
their
benefit.
the
corporation
is
under
the
plenary
supervision
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
that
agency
has
given
the
express
right
to
sue
in
the
district
court
to
compel
the
sipc
to
act
for
the
benefit
of
its
customers.
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
sec's
right
of
action
is
exclusive
of
the
right
claimed
by
the
customers
themselves.
examination
of
the
statutory
allocation
of
functions
among
the
sec,
makes
changes,
and
the
sipc
itself
indicates
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
allow
a
self-interested
customer
to
trigger
the
process
by
which
a
broker
dealer
is
liquidated.
the
judgment
below
is
therefore
reversed.

justice
