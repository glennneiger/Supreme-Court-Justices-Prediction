mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
two
issues
upon
which
says
certiorari
was
granted
in
this
case
were
briefly
first
whether
or
not
customers
of
a
member
of
sipc
have
an
implied
right
of
action
to
require
sipc
to
discharge
its
obligation
under
the
act.
in
spite
of
the
provisions
of
section
7
(b)
which
extend
that
right
to
the
sec.
briefly,
the
receivers
position
on
the
first
issue
is
that
it
is
both
necessary
and
appropriate
under
the
facts
of
this
case
to
the
imply
such
the
right
of
action,
in
order
for
the
customers
of
guided
by
in
securities
corporation
to
receive
and
its
benefits
from
the
act
and
in
order
for
the
stated
and
designated
purpose
of
the
act
to
be
effectuated.
in
that
instance,
we
rely
upon
the
case
of
j.i.
case
against
borak.
we
also
rely
upon
the
doctrine
of
common
law
which
is
quoted
in
the
rigsby
case
which
has
been
referred
to
the
effect
that
in
every
case
where
a
statute
enacts,
and
this
is
the
pertinent
part,
“enacts
a
thing
for
the
benefit
of
a
person,
he
shall
have
a
remedy
upon
the
same
statute
for
the
thing
enacted
for
his
advantage.
it
is
our
position
that
in
this
instance
unless
the
customers
through
their
representative
the
receiver
are
accorded
some
remedy.
they
will
not
receive
any
benefits
under
the
act
and
the
manifest
legislative
purpose
will
be
frustrated
as
to
the
right
of
the
sec
to
do
this
same
thing.
now,
i
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
7
(b)
is
a
part
of
a
section
listing
the
functions
of
the
sec.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
indicates
that
the
commission
have
a
hand
in
the
drafting
and
the
sponsoring
of
the
legislation.
i
suggest
that
that
section
was
put
in
there
to
make
certain
that
the
sec
did
have
the
right
to
take
such
action
if
it
shows
but
the
court
will
note
that
7
(b)
does
not
require
the
sec
to
do
this.
if
the
sec
finds
that
sipc
has
not
met
its
obligations
the
statute
does
not
say
it
shall
seek
an
order
of
the
court
but
it
may
seek
an
order
of
the
court.
so,
that
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
did
your
honor
mean
pursuing
other
remedies
to
protect
--
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
--
protect
the
customers.
i
think
that
is
always
available
to
both
the
sipc
and
the
sec.
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
should
have
been
shall.
i'm
saying
that
the
way
it
is
now
worth
it
the
customers,
the
investors
are
left
with
nothing
but
a
hope
for
an
active
grace
on
the
part
of
sipc
with
the
concurrence
of
the
commission.
unless
the
customers
have
some
remedy
in
the
event
that
both
the
sipc
and
the
commission
elect
not
to
take
any
action.
and
i
submit
that
this
act
was
never
pass
that
congress
to
invest
in
sipc
and
the
commission
a
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
protect
customers,
but
rather
a
discretion
as
your
honor
suggest
as
to
the
means
by
which
they
will
protect
customers,
so
that
there
is
the
flexibility.
but
now,
the
facts
of
the
case
before
this
court
are
such
that
they
have
done
nothing.
and
we
have
gotten
no
cooperation
or
assistance,
or
protection
from
sipc
and
no
enforcement
from
the
commission.
and
we
have
no
prospect
in
this
case
unless
the
court
finds
that
when
this
splendid
supervisory
procedure
breaks
down
for
whatever
reason
the
customers
can
do
something.
now,
this
act
was
passed
in
lieu
of
an
insurance
act
in
the
nature
of
the
fdic
and
it
appear
that
congress
was
concern
that
investors
would
get
to
return
of
their
securities
and
their
money
that
was
on
deposit
with
a
failed
broker-dealer.
there
is
no
suggestion
that
congress
meant
this
to
be
a
discretionary
matter
with
sipc
and
the
commission
but
rather
that
if
they
could
protect
those
customers
in
some
other
way
if
they
could
effect
then
infusion
of
the
additional
capital
or
merger
or
anything
else
they
didn't
have
to
put
the
broker-dealer
and
receivership.
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
it
doesn't
say
that
your
honor.
i
have
to
simply
argue
of
that
this
was
the
intent
of
congress.
that
congress
could
have
gone
the
insurance
wrap
but
that
it
shows
to
require
the
industry
to
accept
responsibility
which
had
already
been
attempted
and
made
themselves
insurers,
so
to
speak.
but
your
honor
it's
correct,
the
statute
does
not
in
so
many
words
insure
customers
that
they
will
be
protected
up
to
a
certain
level
as
the
fdic
act
that.
but
i
say
as
a
matter
of
argument
i
think
was
the
intent
and
the
flexibility
was
written
in
that
to
give
the
commission
and
the
sipc
the
opportunity
to
effect
that
some
other
way
but
other
the
facts
of
this
case
they've
done
nothing
and
we
tried
for
months
to
even
get
an
indication
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
intervene
in
this
case
and
then
finally
we
found
that
they
would
not.
now
as
to
the
standing
of
the
receiver
of
course,
he
has
no
standing
accept
as
a
representative
of
the
customers
and
i
must
conceive
that
in
the
order
that
--
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
the
sipc
would
not
intervene
and
the
sec
would
not
compel
them
to
intervene
by
70
act.
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
yes.
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
i
do
take
some
conflict
from
that.
i
receive
that
saturday
before
i
left
nashville
and
it
was
the
first
--
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
i
would
like
not
to
be
dependant
upon
the
goodwill
of
the
commission.
we've
been
in
this
matter
for
four
years
and
this
is
the
first
indication
that
they've
given
us
that
they
would
give
us
a
hearing
or
any
opportunity
we've
been
completely
shot
up.
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
almost.
i
do
up.
as
to
the
standing
of
--
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
technically,
it
is
a
respondent
but
they
support
position
of
the
sipc.
they
say
that
the
receiver
has
no
standing
and
the
customers
have
no
implied
cause
of
action.
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
i
brought
both
end
because
i
frankly,
i
don't
know
what
to
do.
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
correct.
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
from
that
the
commission
agreed
with
the
receivers
as
to
the
applicability
to
act.
this
was
really
the
question
on
the
merits
and
the
--
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
and
they
agreed
with
the
receiver
on
that
and
of
course
the
district
court
decided
against
the
receiver
the
sixth
circuit
decided
before
the
receiver.
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
my
recollection
is
that
they
cited
with
sipc
and
said
that
the
receiver
had
no
standing
that.
in
this
--
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct
with
your
honor
please.
here,
they
have
not
argued
with
because
they
say
we
won't
get
to
that
point.
now
as
to
the
standing
of
the
receiver,
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
this
in
the
court
with
much
authority
and
the
ordinary
liquidation
procedure
that
the
receiver
does
represent
the
failed
corporation
and
it's
his
obligation
to
marshal
assets,
and
he
passes
its
own
claims
in
that
sort
of
thing.
i
submit
that
this
is
not
the
ordinary
liquidation
and
that
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
this
proceeding
was
very
similar
to
sipc
liquidation.
now,
although,
when
we
started
into
it
we
didn't
even
know
about
the
act
but
the
first
thing
we
did
under
the
in
fact
instructions
of
the
court
was
try
to
device
a
plan
to
get
back
to
the
customers
they're
bonds,
that's
where
we
dealing
with
the
charge
bonds
and
the
net
cash
balances
which
is
precisely
what
an
sipc
trustee
would
have
had
to
do.
and
certainly
on
sipc
trustee
would
have
had
an
obligation
to
those
customers
and
a
duty
to
protect
them
and
to
get
their
property
not
just
the
property
of
the
failed
broker-dealer
and
this
--
what
we've
undertaken
to
do.
now,
it
someone
embarrassing
to
be
cast
in
the
role
of
antelope
here
but
we
sincerely
believe
and
the
district
court
certainly
agreed
with
us
that
we
had
an
obligation
to
seek
the
benefits
of
this
act
for
these
customers
and
we
could
be
wrong.
it
just
seem
to
us
that
we
had
not
succeeded
in
doing
what
the
court
had
instructed
us
to
do
and
that
was
to
get
all
those
bonds
back
and
all
those
funds
back.
we
had
to
create
in
sipc
fund.
we
didn't
have
an
sipc
fund.
we
adopted
a
mechanism
of
the
5%
assessment
to
create
a
fund.
at
that
time,
we
didn't
have
enough
money
to
pay
all
the
net
cash
balances.
the
first
american
national
bank
there
nashville
had
set
offer
with
$250,000.00
of
the
funds
of
this
broker-dealer
which
we
convince
them
what
actually
trust
funds
much
of
which
with
this
net
cash
balances,
so
that
when
we
went
into
this
plan
of
5%,
we
didn't
now
whether
we
going
to
get
that
money
back
or
not.
some
people
had
net
cash
balances,
some
had
deficits,
some
had
large
balances
and
so
on,
and
are
equalize
them
all
we
adopted
this
mechanism.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
having
pursued
this
plan
the
receiver
has
an
obligation
to
pursue
whatever
remedy
the
customers
have
under
this
act.
now,
it's
also
true
that
the
cases
that
the
sipc
has
analyzed
to
your
honors
involved
prohibitive
acts
and
torture
type
of
conduct
and
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
and
i've
not
been
able
to
cite
your
honors
to
a
case
which
is
precise
to
like
this
but
i
say
that
we're
not
here
seeking
damages
because
somebody
violated
an
act.
we
are
here
because
we
understand
that
congress
are
set
up
a
plan
to
protect
people
just
like
those
that
the
receiver
represent
here
and
we've
been
frustrated
and
so,
we're
not
seeking
damages
as
in
these
other
cases.
we
are
simply
seeking
some
method
either
through
the
commission
or
the
sipc.
we're
no
respect
to
your
presence
to
get
the
benefits
of
the
act
to
these
customers.
mr.
w.
ovid
collins,
jr.
the
return
of
their
money,
that's
all
they're
entitled
to.
the
general
creditors
are
not
in
it,
they're
not
going
to
get
a
dime.
we
read
everything
in
cite
in
order
to
be
able
to
pay
these
people
their
money
and
the
general
creditors
are
going
to
get
nothing.
it's
also
true,
i
think
as
pointed
out
in
the
commission's
brief
and
in
the
brief
of
sipc
that
perhaps
this
won't
happen
again.
there
was
a
breakdown
as
your
honors
know,
if
you
read
the
briefs,
and
perhaps
it
won't
happen
again.
i'm
sure
that
the
system
is
perfected
now.
but
where
did
that
leave
the
people
that
we
are
representing.
this
is
the
only
chance
they've
got
and
the
fact
that
it
may
not
happen
again
is
small
comfort
to
them
plus
that
fact
that
it
seems
to
me
it
could
happen
again
if
the
commission
and
the
sec
were
to
take
the
same
position
they
have
taken
here.
you
see,
when
the
sec
came
in
and
file
this
petition
they
said,
“well,
you
might
not
sustain
the
law,
as
you
can
sue
the
principles
and
you
get
money
from
them
and
you
might
not
have
a
loss.”
well,
they
could
say
that
the
next
time
a
proceeding
like
this
comes
on
you
can
sue
the
president.
he
--
you
can
get
money
back
then
and
costumers
won't
have
any
loss.
the
trouble
that
is
that
if
this
is
upheld
and
the
receiver
prior
to
any
sipc
liquidation
sues
the
president
and
fails
or
gets
the
judgment
and
doesn't
collect
it,
and
the
customers
do
sustain
a
loss.
then
the
customers
comeback
to
sipc
and
said,
“now
we've
got
a
loss,
how
about
coming
on
it.”
they
say,
“oh
no,
it's
too
late
now
you've
gone
way
down
the
road
with
the
receivership,
you
returned
bonds,
you've
done
this
and
you've
that,
too
late
now
we
can't
come
in.”
now,
all
of
that
is
precisely
what
is
happened
here.
the
only
difference
being
that
they
would
not
be
this
confusion
about
the
original
notice
and
the
issue
as
to
retroactivity
of
the
act.
so,
that
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
is
important
that
customers
have
some
remedy
if
everything
else
breaks
down.
i
can
understand
that
it
would
certainly
make
the
administration
of
the
act
more
difficult
if
every
customer
along
the
line
will
bring
a
law
suit.
but
in
any
event,
a
court
has
got
to
make
an
adjudication
as
to
whether
it
is
the
proper
case
whether
the
sipc
goes
in
or
customer
or
somebody
else,
the
court
has
got
to
decide
whether
it's
a
proper
case.
if
the
sipc
comes
in
and
it
says,
“we
don't
want
to
liquidate
this
broker-dealer
and
now
we
think
we
can
get
somebody
to
put
some
money
in
it
or
we
think
we
can
work
out
in
a
merge."
then
the
court
can
exercise
its
right
then
to
hold
offer
a
receivership
and
the
flexibility
of
the
act
is
sufficient
for
that
purpose,
so
that
we
don't
that
the
granting
to
the
customers
a
day
in
court.
when
the
facts
justify
will
embarrass
the
administration
of
the
act
and
that
in
this
case
it's
necessary
and
it
could
be
important
in
some
future
case.
thank
you
sir.
