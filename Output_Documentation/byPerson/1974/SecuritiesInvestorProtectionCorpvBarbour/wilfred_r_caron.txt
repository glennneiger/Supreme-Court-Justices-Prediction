mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
one
would
think,
i
would
be
happy
to
wait
awhile
but
in
any
event
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
you.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
may
i
please
the
court.
i
would
stated
the
outset
that
this
particular
case
presents
for
review
for
the
first
time
the
securities
investor
protection
act
of
1970
which
are
created
to
the
petitioner,
the
securities
investor
protection
corporation.
i
would
probably
slip
into
certain
jargon
because
of
our
familiarity
with
the
act,
so
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
i
will
refer
to
that
legislation
as
the
1970
act,
i
would
be
referring
to
the
petitioner
as
sipc
by
which
it
has
come
to
be
called
and
i
would
be
referring
to
brokers
and
dealers
who
are
required
to
the
numbers
of
sipc
as
simply
as
members.
as
i
view
the
issues
in
the
case,
the
particular
circumstances,
now
out
of
which
these
issues
arise,
are
not
particularly
important
or
material
for
the
purposes
of
context,
however,
i
would
summarize
into
this
fashion.
the
controversy
does
arise
out
of
a
liquidating
receivership
of
a
tennessee
broker-dealer
and
several
affiliated
companies
who
are
not
broker-dealers.
soon
after
the
receivership
commenced,
there
was
an
order
made
requiring
persons
who
claimed
ownership
of
certain
securities
to
make
a
deposit
of
5%
of
the
principle
amount
as
a
reserved
to
cover
administrative
expenses
and
fees,
since
that
time
of
that
5%,
3.5%
has
been
returned.
approximately
four
months
after
the
commencement
of
the
receivership,
one
had
been
in
fact
substantially
completed,
sipc
was
notified
by
counsel
for
the
receiver
that
there
appear
to
be
some
risked
that
those
persons
who
made
those
deposits
maybe
exposed
to
some
lost
and
therefore
requested
certain
advances
of
funds
in
order
to
make
up
the
difference.
for
various
reasons
which
we
felt
were
good
and
sufficient
which
are
not
before
this
court,
after
consideration
of
the
available
information
in
the
status
of
the
proceeding,
sipc
determine
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
intervene
in
those
circumstances.
and
following
that
of
course,
the
receiver
five
months
later
commenced
a
proceeding
in
the
district
court
nashville,
the
object
and
purpose
of
which
was
to
compel
sipc
to
provide
whatever
the
benefits
are
under
the
70
act
to
these
persons
who
was
still
owe
that
1.5%
deposit.
that's
the
thrust
of
the
proceeding
and
it
is
in
our
judgment
a
proceeding
which
seeks
relief
precisely
of
the
kind
which
the
1970
act
expressly
granted
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
in
consequence,
the
issues
which
this
court
has
agreed
to
hear
and
review
are
these
firstly,
whether
or
not
members
of
the
investing
public
who
are
customers
of
a
failed
member
have
a
right
to
invoke
this
extraordinary
remedy
to
review
a
determination
by
sipc
and
compel
certain
mandatory
relief;
and
secondly,
if
indeed
such
a
right
exists
or
can
be
implied
from
the
statute
whether
or
not
this
receiver
has
the
standing
to
maintain
such
an
action.
our
position
essentially
is
that
the
grant
to
the
sec
of
this
extraordinary
remedy
of
enforcement
over
sipc
in
order
to
compel
it,
to
perform
its
statutory
responsibilities
is
clearly
an
exclusive
grant
of
a
very
extraordinary
power
and
an
extraordinary
remedy,
our
position
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
or
in
the
statute
itself
to
suggest
the
contrary.
indeed
our
position
is
that
an
analysis
of
the
statute,
and
its
purpose,
and
its
legislative
history
would
clearly
indicate
that
congress
indeed
are
fashion
and
created
a
special
supervisory
tool,
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
the
commission
and
indeed
expected
that
no
member
of
the
general
public
would
simultaneously
enjoy
that
considerable
hour.
we
depend
on
a
statutory
analysis,
we
have
course
look
to
certain
maxims
of
construction
but
in
my
opinion
to
the
extent
we
look
to
principles
of
construction,
there
only
really
assistance
to
what
i
regard
as
ineluctable
conclusion.
because
the
job
of
an
analysis
is
far
better
than
in
writing
and
in
briefs,
i
would
not
attempt
to
detail
too
much
of
the
contents
of
the
brief
we
file.
i
would
like
however,
to
focus
on
three
aspects
of
the
statute
which
i
consider
to
be
most
helpful
and
most
critical.
firstly,
i
would
like
to
mention
briefly
the
purpose
of
the
legislation.
it
was
enacted
in
--
effective
december
1970,
in
the
wake
of
a
considerable
number
of
broker-dealer
failures
in
the
bad
years
of
1967,
68',
69',
70'.
the
thrust
and
purpose
was
to
bolster
investor
confidence
in
the
securities
markets
and
by
this
1970
act,
congress
attacked
the
problem
in
a
number
of
ways,
some
were
affirmative
and
some
were
negative.
it
certainly
enhanced
the
commission's
power
to
promulgate
and
enforced
financial
responsibility
rules
for
brokers
and
dealers.
it
gave
the
commission
the
power
to
impose
on
self-regulatory
organizations,
the
duty
to
adopt
additional
rules
of
any
kind.
it
looked
to
the
improvement
of
the
examination
and
inspection
procedures
of
the
self-regulatory
organizations
to
assure
compliance
with
rules
affecting
financial
responsibility
and
to
detect
early
as
possible
approaching
financial
difficulty.
they
directed
the
commissions
and
conduct
the
study
in
unsafe
and
unsound
practices
which
he
did.
and
finally,
part
and
possible
this
attack
on
the
problem
of
investor
confidence,
it
did
create
sipc.
it
created
it
as
a
non-industry
or
rather
a
nonprofit
industry
funded
membership
corporation.
it
provided
specifically
it
would
not
be
a
government
agency.
it
created
it
so
that
in
the
event
these
attempts
to
avoid
failures
were
not
successful
in
certain
cases.
public
confidence
could
be
boosted
by
the
notion
that
there
is
an
organization
after
all
which
stands
behind
the
failure
of
that
type
with
its
funds.
it
created
an
organization
funded
by
the
industry
with
only
the
possibility
of
a
call
and
federal
money.
and
it
created
a
corporation
with
a
board
of
directors
which
is
prescribed
by
statute,
a
responsible
one
in
my
opinion
of
balance
to
one.
there
is
not
federal
dominance.
there
is
not
industry
dominance.
there
is
not
public
dominance.
there
have
been
considerable
reputations
in
the
brief
to
indicate
how
they
selected.
the
second
point
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
the
means
by
which
public
customers
are
protected
when
brokers
and
dealers
do
fail
who
are
members
of
sipc.
there
is
a
dependence
on
the
part
of
sipc
on
the
information
and
cooperation
of
the
self-regulatory
organizations
and
the
sec,
they
are
the
ones
who
the
examining
authority.
they
are
the
ones
who
receive
the
reports,
we
do
none.
however
under
our
statute,
they
have
the
obligation
when
they
the
facts
which
lead
them
to
believe
that
perhaps
a
firm
is
approaching
difficulty
to
report
those
facts
to
us.
and
as
that's
done,
if
the
situation
appears
to
warrant
the
critical
analysis
on
the
basis
of
the
available
facts,
we
do
that
and
we
look
to
our
statute
which
authorizes
us
to
do
the
following.
if
one
or
five
statutory
conditions
exist
and
it
is
spell
that
in
the
statute,
for
example,
insolvency.
to
some
extent
noncompliance
with
applicable
regulations
in
the
commission
and
if
the
firm
has
failed,
there's
in
danger
of
failing
to
meet
its
obligations
to
customers.
sipc
is
vested
with
the
discretion
to
make
an
applications
to
the
district
court
in
the
appropriate
jurisdiction,
seeking
adjudication
that
customer
require
protection,
seeking
the
appointment
of
a
trustee
in
liquidation
and
there
where
i
will
provide
in
the
protection
contemplated
by
the
statute.
so,
the
ministerial
act
that
the
statute
talks
about,
it
doesn't
amount
to
a
congressional
direction
that
is
doesn't
so
exist
you
must
would
allow
so
flexibility.
the
perimeters
of
which
i
don't
think
are
involved
today
and
have
not
been
determine
in
any
event.
the
proceeding
that
is
brought
is
essentially
involuntary
bankruptcy
proceeding.
the
statute
expands
on
the
powers
of
a
court
of
bankruptcy
by
allowing
certain
chapter
10
powers
and
provisions
to
become
operative
through
in
corporation
by
reference.
but
essentially,
reorganization
is
prohibited,
it
is
truly
a
straight
involuntary
bankruptcy
proceeding
base
to
some
extent
insofar
as
customer's
substantive
rights
are
concerned
on
section
60
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
i
don't
feel
it's
appropriate
to
get
into
that
detail
at
the
moment.
i
think
what
is
really
new
about
this
particular
proceeding,
at
least
two
of
them
more
important
aspects
would
be
this,
because
the
congress
was
concern
about
a
possible
domino
effect
in
the
industry
by
the
failure
of
one
firm.
it
did
authorize
the
completion
of
open
contractual
commitments
between
the
firm
and
liquidation,
and
another
broker-dealer.
more
important
and
most
remain
here
by
the
statute,
the
funds
of
the
member
in
liquidation
the
estate
is
no
longer
the
only
source
from
which
a
customer's
claim
and
bankruptcy
maybe
satisfied.
under
the
statute
sipc
funds
now
whether
certain
prescribe
limits
will
augment
the
estate.
it
is
if
you
will
a
method
of
collection
bonds
of
for
our
substantive
rights
are
concern
not
that
much
difference
between
section
60
of
the
bankruptcy
act
in
our
statute.
there
are
differences
however.
so,
this
is
the
proceeding,
this
is
the
relief
that
it
is
alleged
and
claimed
here
by
the
receiver.
sipc
should
by
reason
of
its
obligations
have
initiated
and
commenced.
the
third
aspect
i
would
look
to
an
oral
argument
is
the
commission
supervision
under
the
statute.
in
some
respects,
the
sec
is
to
use
of
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
thank
you
very
much,
chief
justice.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
close
of
yesterday's
argument,
i
was
at
the
point
of
discussing
briefly
the
supervisory
powers
of
the
commission
and
its
section
7
(b)
enforcement
remedy
which
is
so
directly
involved
in
this
particular
case
and
from
that
point
to
discuss
the
cases
which
is
sited
by
the
respondent
in
support
of
his
position.
we
have
emphasized
in
the
brief
the
overall
supervisory
responsibilities
of
the
commission
over
sipc.
they're
extensive
and
they
are
detailed
at
least
10
specifications
at
pages
10
to
12
of
our
brief
and
i
would
not
burden
the
court
will
a
repetition
of
those
items.
i
would
illustrate
one
now
to
indicate
the
under
the
swipe
the
commission
does
have
the
power
under
the
statute
to
disapprove
any
by
law
or
any
rule
of
regulation
which
sipc
might
adopt
and
more
than
that
it
has
the
power
to
compel
sipc
to
adopt
the
by
law
at
desire
be
adopted
with
the
same
applies
to
rules
and
has
the
power
to
require
sipc
to
repeal
or
amend
any
existing
by
law.
so,
that
is
one
illustration
of
the
pervasive
control
which
the
congress
has
saw
to
lodge
and
properly
so
in
the
commission
and
there
are
other
examples.
and
we
find
that
section
7
(b)
which
relates
the
enforcement
of
sipc's
statutory
responsibilities
to
the
investing
public.
we
find
that
provision
is
part
in
puzzle
of
packages
of
supervision.
it's
clear
from
the
remarks
of
the
members
of
the
congress
or
at
least
some
of
them
and
we
report
to
some
of
those
that
footnote
30
or
page
11
of
our
brief
that
they
well
understood
and
intended
that
the
commission
assume
on
exclusive
basis
responsibility
the
suit
was
that
the
purposes
of
the
act
would
carried
out
in
every
respect.
i
would
point
to
one
just
to
illustrate
one
congressman
in
these
words,
“the
bill
gives
to
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
continuing
over
side
and
rule
making
authority
over
the
affairs
of
the
corporation
to
ensure
that
the
public
interest
is
served.”
in
light
of
the
receivers
authorities
cited
in
support
of
an
implied
right
of
action,
i
would
focus
just
for
a
moment
on
the
extraordinary
character
of
the
remedy
and
enforcement
power
which
the
commission
has.
section
7
(b)
in
the
first
instance
would
authorize
the
commission
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
sipc
board
of
directors
in
the
event
that
disagree
and
on
the
basis
of
that
difference
of
view,
authorizes
the
commission
to
go
the
federal
district
court
where
our
principal
office
is
located
and
commence
an
action,
perhaps
describable
as
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
or
mandatory
injunction.
but
not
quite
the
one
i
don't
believe
and
it
authorizes
the
court
after
reviewing
the
positions
of
sipc
and
the
commission
to
determine
within
some
parameters
not
yet
establish
that
either
the
commission
is
correct
and
that
sipc
should
be
compelled
to
do
something
under
the
act
namely
commission
liquidation
proceeding
or
otherwise.
and
if
the
relief
is
granted
what
is
happening
as
i
indicated
yesterday
is
the
compulsion
of
a
proceeding
on
an
involuntary
basis
to
liquidate
a
broker
dealer
with
all
the
impact
that
has
and
then
the
process
triggering
the
release
of
the
funds
in
sipc
for
the
purposes
of
the
proceeding
and
in
the
event
that
its
on
funds
should
proven
adequate
either
by
reason
of
that
case
or
a
combination
circumstances
triggering
a
call
by
way
of
a
barrowing
on
the
us
treasury.
those
are
the
dimension
of
the
remedy
which
the
commission
enjoys
by
express
grant.
the
receivers
position,
if
i
understand
correctly,
is
that
by
reason
of
the
broad
purposes
of
the
70
act
an
equivalent
and
duplicate
remedy
for
precise
in
the
same
purposes
should
be
implied
and
that's
the
term
i
believe
should
be
implied
in
favor
of
the
customers
of
a
firm
which
may
in
their
judgment
feel
that
the
firm
is
in
certain
--
die
a
circumstances
and
that
sipc
should
commence
a
liquidation
proceeding.
it
brings
to
bare
two
principles
cases
really.
one
on
which,
we
rely
and
namely
the
national
railroad
passenger
corporation
case
driver
forged
and
when
the
brief
is
the
amtrak
case.
on
the
other
hand,
the
receiver
would
focus
on
j.i.
case
against
borak
reported
at
377
us.
borak
is
one
of
a
line
of
cases,
the
receiver
also
site
allen
against
the
board
of
education.
we
in
turn
supply
on
that
line
of
cases,
warned
that
transportation
co.
against
united
state,
bivens
against
six
unknown
named
agents,
texas
against
and
pacific
against
rigsby,
fleishman
distilling
and
we
do
that
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
an
analysis
of
what
these
cases
really
mean.
so
far
as
i
can
determine,
that
analysis
indicates
that
they
involve
a
determination
of
whether
a
remedy
traditionally
recognized
by
the
judiciary
should
be
denied
a
particular
litigant
who
was
agreed
by
the
act
of
another
in
violation
of
the
statutory
duty,
a
wrong
and
a
traditional
sense
of
tort.
allen
for
example,
involved
a
deprivation
for
a
voting
right,
bivens
the
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
right
against
search
and
seizure,
borak,
a
violation
of
the
proxy
requirements
of
section
14
(a)
of
the
34
act,
fleishman,
a
violation
of
the
provision
to
the
land
of
act
which
prohibit
infringement
on
trademarks.
rigsby,
a
violation
of
federal
safety
appliance
act
and
wind
that
a
violation
by
reason
of
the
negligence
seeking
of
a
vessel,
a
violation
in
the
section
15
who
delivers
on
harbor
act,
so
on
all
these
cases
and
i'm
certainly
there
are
others.
essentially,
what
is
involved
is
a
wrong
in
the
classic
sense
of
tort,
committed
against
one
in
violation
of
law
and
the
search
in
the
cases
has
been
whether
be
a
constitutional
provision
as
in
bivens
or
a
statutory
provision
as
in
the
other
cases.
the
inquiry
has
been
has
congress
accept
from
bivens
has
congress
by
prescribing
particular
remedies
foreclose
available
traditional
remedies
for
example,
damages,
recession,
injunction.
in
bivens,
there
was
--
in
my
opinion
this
is
because
there
was
a
right
and
no
particular
remedy
prescribed
hence
on,
i
think
traditional
basis,
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
forth
injury
committed
and
all
the
other
cases
i've
cited
except
fleishman.
while
there
were
certain
remedies
of
a
penal
of
civil
nature.
the
fact
was
as
this
court
found
that
the
prescription
of
certain
remedies
was
on
a
sufficient
indication
of
a
congressional
intent
to
foreclose
existing
traditional
remedies.
in
fleishman,
because
of
what
this
court
describe
as
the
prescription
of
intricate
remedies,
it
felt
that
congress
had
indeed
intended
to
foreclose
the
possibility
of
considering
in
award
for
attorneys
fees
in
an
action
under
that
statute.
so,
that
we
have
this
suitable
tread
of
rational;
i
would
refer
to
some
language
in
bivens
and
wind
up
for
example
in
bivens.
the
court
stated
historically
damages
had
been
regardless
of
the
ordinary
remedy
for
invasion
of
personal
interest
and
liberty
presiding
cases.
and
elsewhere
it
was
sudden
bivens
the
question
is
merely
whether
petitioner
is
entitle
to
address
this
injury
to
a
particular
remedial
mechanism
normally
available
in
the
federal
courts
and
for
that
proposition
siding
borak.
wyandotte
much
the
same
just
does
the
court
said
referring
to
borak
case
and
rigsby
case
which
incidentally
i
believe
is
the
first
case
in
this
court
to
hold
the
existence
of
a
private
right
of
action
when
the
framework
of
the
safety
appliance
act.
the
court
stated
the
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
sir?
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
texas
and
pacific,
yes
sir.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
there
abouts
i
haven't
taken
somewhere
to
maybe
earlier
a
case
--
maybe
early
as
matter.
but
this
language
i
find
relevant
again
refer
to
borak
and
rigsby
the
court
in
wyandotte
said
that,
“conclusion
was
in
accordance
with
the
general
rule
of
the
law
of
torts
and
elsewhere
stated
denial
of
such
remedy
to
the
united
states
will
permit
the
result
extraordinary
in
our
jurisprudence
of
a
wrong
to
a
shifting
responsibility
for
the
consequences
of
his
negligence
on
to
a
victim.”
i
would
submit
to
the
court
of
that
the
analysis
of
justice
harlan
in
this
concurring
opinion,
in
bivens
represents
a
very
sound
and
correct
analysis
and
he
said
and
we
quote
in
our
reply
brief
the
notion
of
implying
a
remedy
therefore
has
applied
to
cases
like
borak
can
only
refer
to
a
process
whereby
the
federal
judiciary
exercises
the
choice
among
traditionally
available
judicial
remedies
according
to
reasons
related
to
substantive
social
policy
embodied
in
the
act
of
positive
law.
there
was
an
article
which
i've
found
of
interest
in
preparation
which
is
not
cited
in
our
brief
that
its
historical
development
at
117
pennsylvania
law
review
page
one,
which
was
written
in
the
wake
of
bell
v.
hood
and
it
does
in
my
opinion
a
good
job
of
exploring
the
common
law
back
to
the
13th
and
14
century
england,
and
reaching
the
conclusion
i
believe
that
remedies
recognized
which
i
traditional
are
really
the
old
form
of
action
or
rather
two
one
action
on
the
statute
the
other
trespass
on
the
case.
and
i
think
that
this
is
really
what
is
going
on
in
the
borak
line
of
cases.
rigsby
itself
refers
to
actions
on
the
statute
on
holding
which
common
law.
we
believe
that
the
amtrak
case
represent
some
jurisprudence
of
course
this
court
believes.
it
involves
the
different
proposition,
a
different
problem.
it
relates
to
a
remedy
entrusted
to
a
particular
federal
agency
to
exercise
supervision
and
a
control
over
quasi
public
corporation.
there
are
many
implications
and
we
believe
that
congressional
choices
clear
and
or
to
be
given
deference
under
accepted
principles
of
statutory
construction.
the
test
in
amtrak
as
i
read
it
was
that
given
the
exclusive
grant
of
such
authority,
absent
any
clear
contrary
evidence
of
legislative
intent
that
a
private
remedy
coexist
thereby
placing
supervision
of
the
general
public.
the
statute
must
be
deemed
as
grantly
an
exclusive
remedy.
and
we
think
the
principle
applies
here
for
certiorari
for
reasons
we
indicate
in
the
brief
one
of
which
is
that
the
commission
by
reason
of
his
expertise
and
working
with
sipc
under
this
33
or
34
act
and
the
70
act
is
most
confident,
most
aware
of
situations,
congress
repossess
trusts
in
the
commission,
and
we
therefore
think
that
guided
by
the
authority
in
the
amtrak
case.
but
more
important,
on
a
common
sense
of
appraisal
of
the
70
act
and
what
it
attempts
to
do.
the
act
itself,
the
legislative
history,
the
effectuation
of
a
plan
of
congress,
the
recognition
of
the
difference
between
the
legislative
and
judicial
branches
and
taking
into
account
all
the
available
presidents.
we
do
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
committed
error
and
that
a
right
might
not
be
implied
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
on
the
second
point
concerning
the
receivers
standing,
i
would
not
develop
that
an
oral
argument,
i
think
that
the
concessions
in
the
receivers
brief
two.
one,
that
if
he
were
successful
there
would
no
benefit
to
the
state
of
guarantee
bond;
and
secondly,
guarantee
bond
had
no
right
of
action
in
its
own
right.
i
think
they
make
the
chaplin
case
which
will
rely
upon
perfectly
applicable
in
sound
--
i
was
only
add
that
--
we
believe
that
it's
for
customers
to
decide
whether
in
a
situation
where
both
sipc
and
the
commission
feel
the
statute
should
not
be
applied
it
for
those
individual
to
decide
what
are
their
rights.
we
think
the
receiver
has
obligations
to
win
a
state,
his
duties
to
marshal
and
collect
assets.
he
has
other
credit
to
be
concern
about.
the
chance
of
victory
probably
is
not
that
great,
we
do
believe
that
it
is
on
the
customers
right
if
it
exist
and
that's
the
assumption
for
the
purpose
of
the
second
point
and
that
the
receiver
should
be
denied
standing
in
any
event.
i'd
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have
for
rebuttal,
your
honors.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
thank
your
honor.
i
think
our
brief,
our
reply
brief,
sufficiently
responds
to
the
fabric
of
equitable
coloration
which
seems
to
be
the
emphasis
of
the
receiver's
argument.
i
did
say
an
objective
view
of
the
few
facts
which
the
pleadings
disclose
will
not
support
the
source
of
breakdown,
some
shout
outs,
and
everything
else
has
been
disclose
to
here
today.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
yes,
sir.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
it's
difficult
for
me
to
answer
your
honor.
i
had
only
brief
discussion
with
the
commission
on
this
point.
i
really
couldn't
response
to
the
detail
of
procedure
whatever
the
special
both
to
that
informal
and
in
formal.
i
myself
have
questions
to
whether
or
not
formal
procedures
are
appropriate
in
the
situation
where
you
have
the
sort
of
discretion
large
in
the
commission
which
is
intended
to
be
exercise
in
its
supervision
over
us
which
i'm
afraid
that
i
quite
honestly
could
not
be
definite
on
that
point.
i
think
if
we
must
get
into
the
equities,
there
is
a
fair
enough
indication
in
the
record
that
part
of
the
problem
here
was
the
dormancy
of
the
receiver
in
communicating
with
separate
for
four
months
after
we
knew
when
we
existed.
the
fact
that
he
carried
the
liquidation
through
the
completion
practically
and
then
decided
to
write
a
letter
and
ask
for
the
remainder
to
pay
the
fees
involved.
i
think
though
discussion
of
this
sort
is
not
appropriate
for
the
purpose
of
the
important
question
of
legislative
intent
and
the
construction
that
ought
to
be
brought
to
bear
on
the
statute.
i
simply
suggest
to
the
court
that
issue
were
to
be
answered
in
such
way
as
to
hold
the
70
remedy
accordance
to
the
commission
was
meant
to
be
exclusive
and
that
was
a
proper
exercise
of
congressional
judgment.
