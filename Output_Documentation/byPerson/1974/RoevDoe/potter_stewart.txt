justice
potter
stewart
this
actual
representations
that
you're
making
mr.
karpatkin,
are
you
thereby
implying
if
there
had
been
identification,
the
publication
of
this
book
could
have
been
enjoined?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what's
you're
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
let's
you
got
the
idea
of
writing
a
book,
does
the
secrets
of
my
clients,
and
wrote
it
up
and
had
it
printed,
do
the
publication
of
such
a
book
being
enjoined
if
you
identified
all
your
clients,
disclosed
all
their
incompetencies,
they
have
reposed
in
you?
justice
potter
stewart
and
nothing
in
the
constitution
at
least
would
prevent
the
injunction
of
a
publication
of
such
a
book,
that
hypothetical
book?
justice
potter
stewart
why
hypothetical
book?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
say
that
the
plaintiff
won't
have
any
constitutional
right
to
have
the
book
going
but
that
would
be
up
to
the
state,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
my
hypothetical
case
of
these
authors,
actually
it
is
closing
conceitedly
disclosing
the
identity
and
thereby
violating
the
confidences
of
their
patients
or
in
the
attorney
of
hypothetical
case
of
view
the
author
of
the
book,
the
secrets
of
the
clients
of
the
lawyer's
lifetime,
you
would
concede
that
there's
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
would
prevent
a
state
from
enjoining
the
publication
of
such
a
book,
if
the
state
shows
to
do
so,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
would
meet
then?
what
are
the
standards?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
say
after
a
full
hearing,
this
was
found.
justice
potter
stewart
seeking
would
make
it
applicable
to
the
states?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
the
state
might
assert
a
variety
of
interest
or
maybe
the
same
interest
expressed
a
variety
of
ways
one
like
the
breach
for
confidential
relationship,
another
way
of
perhaps
putting
the
same
thing
as
the
violation
of
an
implied
contract.
another
way
might
be
of
saying
if
the
state
law
is
so
protective
of
this
confidential
relationship
that
will
not
allow
a
position
physician
or
a
lawyer
to
testify
even
a
court
of
law
where
the
whole
purpose
is
to
get
at
the
truth.
certainly,
that
interest
is
strong
enough
to
prevent
anybody
ride
a
free
zone
profit
violating
the
same
secrets
of
how
it
came
around
in
the
bookstores
of
this
state.
and
there
might
be
other
and
there
might
be
just
to
regulation
of
the
professions
as
such,
even
the
medical
profession
or
the
legal
person,
the
ethics
profession.
and
the
variety
of
another
state
interest
none
of
these
is
a
constitutional
interest
to
put
the
constitutional
question
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin,
can
a
state
even
when
they're
on
for
disclosure,
in
the
interest
of
furthering
of
these
objectives
prevent
in
advance
the
publication
of
the
book
that
would,
probably
wouldn't
do,
in
amount
to
a
full
disclosure
of
these
confidences.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
state
interest—it's
not
for
us
to
say
what
the
ground
the
state
might
put
as
centers
now,
that's
not
a
constitutional
question,
the
question
is
does
the
constitution
permit
the
state
from
enjoining
the
publication?
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
a
state
cause
of
action
under
the
state
tort
law,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
we
don't
even
have
to
consider
that
question
because
in
this
case
the
court
follow
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
or
you
read
it
essentially
correct
i
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
when
i
--
mr.
karpatkin,
the
question
that
you
just
referred
to
whether
or
not
he
conceded
it
if
after
full
due
process
procedures
there
were
a
finding
that
this
book
did
identify
your
client
and
did
disclose
and
publicize
the
confidentiaries
repose
by
your
client
and
the
defendant
authors
of
the
book.
could
new
york
constitutionally
enjoin
the
publication
of
the
book,
and
i
understood
him
to
say,
yes
it
could.
now,
may
i
ask
you
the
opposite
question,
if
after
a
due
process
hearing
by
a
process
hearing,
it
was
determined
that
there
was
no
identification
of
your
client
in
this
book,
do
you
think
new
york
could
constitutionally
enjoin
this
publication?
justice
potter
stewart
disclosure
implies
identification,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
that
wasn't
my
question,
my
question
wasn't
whether
or
not
a
cause
of
action
might
exist
in—under
the
statute
or
common
law
in
new
york,
but
whether
or
not
such
a
cause
of
action
could
constitutionally
exist
if
there
were
no
identification
whatsoever
of
your
client.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
answer
isn't
that
new
york
gives
this
cause
of
action,
because
the
question
does
not
have
to
do
with
the
law
of
new
york
it
has
to
do
with
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here
the
conduct
is
writing
and
publishing
a
book
is
that
conduct?
if
this
conduct
then
the
first
amendment
is
meaningless.
justice
potter
stewart
my
hypothetical
case
was
one
which
there
was
no
violation
of
any
confidences
because
there
was
no
disclosure.
now,
if
i
told
you
that
somebody
once
told
me
the
following
confidential
story,
and
i
won't
tell
you
who
it
was
or
when
it
was
i'm
not
violating
anybody's
confidences
am
i?
i
would
think
so
your
honor,
if
you
would
tell
him
not
to
disclose
that
story
as
she
would
promised
not
to
tell
that
story
ever.
but
may
i
say
that
we
have
a
case
here
in
which
the
question
of
identification
does
not
exist
because
as
a
matter
of
law
that
patient
was
identified
in
this
book.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
if
you
were
right,
then
this
means
that
there
could
be
no
publications
of
this
nature
by
any
psychiatric
authority?
justice
potter
stewart
by
any
psychiatric
authority.
justice
potter
stewart
that
freud
himself
could
have
published
what
he
did
published,
because
he
did
to
his
very
level
best
to
obliterate
any
identification
or
identity.
this
means
if
new
york
state
had
it
wanted
to,
back
in
the
era
where
freud
was
writing,
could
have
enjoined
that
publication
of
everything
he
wrote.
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
i
misunderstood
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
that
special
term
may
have
found
i
have
suggested,
but
it
went
on
to
say
that
it
didn't
think
that
this
disclosure
would
really
identify
plaintiff
as
the
patient
to
someone
who
did
not
already
know
that
plaintiff
was
a
patient.
now,
that
implies
that
certainly
people
who
knew
the
patient
could
identify
him.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
might
be
able
to
identify
the
patient
through
some
of
these
events,
but
they
certainly
wouldn't
know
everything
that
was
disclosed.
so,
i
would
suppose
you
would
argue
this
is
in
itself
is
enough,
there's
never
been
any
finding
here
that
there
was
no
identification.
justice
potter
stewart
why
you
--
i
don't
know,
why
you
don't
stop
there
for
at
least,
but
just
to
say
that
that
is--you
should
be
able
to
win
your
case
on
that
--
