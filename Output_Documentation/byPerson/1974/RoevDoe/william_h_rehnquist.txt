justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
trial
on
the
preliminary
or
in
the
permanent
too?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
preliminary
you
can
hear
on
affidavit,
you
can
hear
just
on
the
affidavit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
karpartkin,
is
there
any
rule
of
new
york
practice
that
would
have
prevented
you
or
the
respondents
for
that
matter,
while
you
are
appealing
the
preliminary
injunction
up
to
the
new
york
appellate
system
from
asking
the
case
to
come
on
for
hearing
on
the
final
injunction
before
the
supreme
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
didn't
you
do
that,
if
you
are
concern
about
getting
the
book
on
the
street
service?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
you
get
pretrial
discovery
in
connection
of
the
injunction
action
in
new
york?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
he
would
have
granted
it
in
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
can
see
their
point
of
view.
they've
got
what
they
want.
they've
got
a
restraining
order
but
i
think
from
your
point
of
view,
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
the
thing
as
expediently
as
possible,
at
least
one
thing
you
would
consider
is
having
the
thing
come
out
in
the
same
court
that
granted
the
preliminary.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
under
rule,
that's
under
the
federals
rules
as
civil
procedure,
we're
administrating
a
very
explicit
system
of
rules,
over
courts
which
we
have
supervisory
authority,
but
we
don't
have
supervisors
there
over
the
new
york
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
case
is
stronger
too,
is
it
because
here
you
were
enjoined
and
then
2614
was
an
action
for
damage,
and
it
time
against
hill
it
was
action
for
damage.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
london,
before
you
leave
that,
i'm
puzzled
about
your
explanation
of
new
york
practice
because
i'm
trying
to
agree
with
what
i
think
is
mr.
justice
white's
view
that
the
special
term
found
the
issue
of
disguising
against
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
well
--
now
is
it
your
position
that
it's
that
finding
that
is
controlling
on
us
or
that's
something
more
favorable
of
you
--
wait,
wait
till
i
finish
my
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
that
something
more
favorable
to
you
happened
in
the
appellate
division
and
then
if
that
finding
that's
binding
us.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
in
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
division?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
again,
give
you
this
example,
supposing
that
the
special
term
had
refused
an
injunction
and
specifically
found
there
was
no
irreparable
injury.
and
you
went
up
to
the
new
york
courts
and
consistently
disputed
whether
or
not
there
was
irreparable
injury,
but
you
never
got
any
finding
different
from
on
the
special
term.
now,
could
you
come
here
and
say
that
because
that
was
disputed
even
though
the
special
term
we
founded
against
you
we
had
to
resolve
it
in
your
favor?
