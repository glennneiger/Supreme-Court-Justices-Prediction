justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
conceded
that
the
usual
steps
were
taken?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
that
connection
i
think
in
what
you're
saying
would
satisfy
any
requirement
of
finality
for
fair
view.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
are
you
making
this
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
do
we
do
with
this--how
do
you
characterize
this
statement
of
the
special
term,
where
the
judge
says,
“i
think
these
steps
reasonably
meet
the
usual
standards
for
such
disguising
of
the
patient's
identities.”
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
think
it
was
modified
by
the
statement
which
characterize
the
publisher
acts
has
an
attempt
to
disguise
her
identity?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
maybe
so
but
do
you
think
that
is
appellate
position's
rejection
of
this
factual?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
oh,
i
know
but
on
that
basis,
this
just
becomes
a
fact
bound
case
that
may
not
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
interest
a
lot
of
people.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
suggesting,
i'm
just
--
are
you
--
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
we
accept
the
finding
of
the
special
term,
i
guess
that's
the
finding
that
this
meets
the
usual
standards
for
disguising
identity.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
you
go
ahead
but
you
might
get
back
to
telling
me
at
some
point
what
if
we
do
except
that
finding
in
the
special
term,
what
happens
to
your
case
if
anything?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
did
both
of
the
lower
courts.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
london
gets
me
back
to
basics
here.
let
me
ask
you
a
question
that
no
one
else
has
asked,
by
basics,
i
mean
this
12573
of
28
usc
provides
a
petition
for
certiorari
here
from
a
final
judgment
of
a
state
court.
you
can
see
there's
a
final
judgment
here
when
we've
had
no
trials
yet?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
seems
to
me
all
these
question
are
asked
because
of
something
must
done
a
--
than
what
we
would
have
after
a
full
trial.
