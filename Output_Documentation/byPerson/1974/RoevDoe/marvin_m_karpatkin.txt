mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice
may
i
please
the
court.
the
critical
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
first
amendment's
prohibition
against
prior
restraint
is
violated
by
the
grant
of
a
total
preliminary
injunction
against
the
distribution
of
a
scientific
book.
a
cycle
of
therapeutic
cases
where
the
only
finding
which
has
been
made
by
any
judge
concerning
disguise
of
the
patients
is
that
the
defendant
doctor
took
reasonable
steps
to
meet
the
usual
standards
for
disguising
the
patient's
identity.
the
injunction
has
been
in
effect
since
may
7th
of
1973
more
than
17
months.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
is
conceded
that
that
is
what
was
held
by
the
justice
presiding
its
special
term
in
new
york
county,
mr.
justice
silverman
and
its
set
forth
of
page
883
in
the
record,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
words
appear
at
883,
mr.
chief
justice.
883
in
the
appendix
and
if
i
may
read,
defendants
have
taken
some
steps
to
disguise
the
identity
of
the
patients.
i
think
those
steps
reasonably
meet
the
usual
standards
for
such
disguising
of
the
patient's
identities.
that
is
the
only
finding
which
has
been
made
concerning
disguise.
and
then
the
court
engages
in
this
bit
of
speculation
as
to
who
might
be
able
to
penetrate
the
disguise.
the
court
says,
while
i
have
not
read
this
1,000
page
book,
the
examples
of
possible
identification
given
by
plaintiff
in
the
moving
affidavit
must
be
assumed
to
be
the
more
striking
ones.
i
do
not
think
that
they
would
really
identify
plaintiff
as
the
patient
to
someone
who
did
not
already
know
that
plaintiff
was
the
patient.
necessarily
subsumed
into
this
primary
question
of
the
prior
restraint
is
the
connective
question
of
what
are
the
constitutional
limits
of
any
cause
of
action,
which
would
seek
to
impose
liability
on
a
doctor
for
publication
of
a
case
history.
and
as
much
as
there
can
be
no
provisional
remedy
equitable
or
otherwise
in
the
absence
of
a
constitutionally
sufficient
cause
of
action,
this
second
question
is
of
necessity
subsumed
in
the
first,
while
the
constitutionality
of
a
prior
restraint
on
publication
is
hardly
enough
of
question
for
this
court.
it's
attempted
imposition
in
this
case
on
a
conceitedly
truthful,
non-obscene
scientific
book.
in
fact,
a
book
length
case
history
of
a
cause
of
cycle
therapeutic
treatment
which
is
more
than
10
years
over
is
most
decidedly
a
case
of
first
impression.

more
than
1,000

court

term
without
a
trial
or
an
evidentiary
hearing
of
any
kind
indeed
under
the
new
york
civil
practice
law
and
rules,
there's
no
mandatory
right
to
someone
facing
an
injunction
to
have
a
testimonial
hearing,
much
less
a
full
trial
on
the
merits.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
on
a
permanent
injunction,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
presume
is
an
injunction
f
a
trial
and
they're
all
the
rights,
which
would
normally
take
place
on
the
trial.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist
and
that
is
what
happened
in
this
case
and
that
is
indeed
is
the
usual
practice
in
new
york.
it
is
unusual
but
it
happens
occasionally.
for
a
justice,
its
special
term
to
order
a
testimonial
hearing.
and
there
is
no
absolute
right
to
it
and
we
sight
a
case
in
our
brief
which
indicates
that
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
justice.
as
this
more
of
the
states
and
his
opinions
that
he
has
not
even
read
the
book.
what's
more,
he
made
the
following
observation,
findings
and
statements
within
incomprehensively,
inconsistent
with
his
conclusion.
namely,
that
it
is
a
well-established
practice
in
the
medical
profession
and
in
the
public
interest
for
a
physician
to
publish
case
histories.
this
being
a
tradition
started
by
doctor
freud.
indeed,
the
only
citation
of
authority
in
the
opinion
with
special
term
is
a
citation
to
doctor
freud.
also
an
observation,
scientific
value
of
the
book
is
not
a
fit
subject
for
judicial
evaluation.
also,
the
statements
that
defendants
taken
steps
to
disguise,
which
i
read
to
the
court
and
respond
for
the
chief
justice's
question,
and
with
respect
to
the
many
examples,
34
number
of
claimed
identification
given
by
plaintiff
and
her
moving
affidavit.
it
was
not
a
sentence
of
all
testimony
or
cross-examination
on
that.
the
court
found,
i
do
not
think
they
were
really
identified
plaintiff
as
the
patient
to
someone
who
did
not
already
know
that
plaintiff
was
the
patient.
i
respectfully
submit
that
by
the
use
of
this
double
negative.
the
special
term,
it
is
eliminated
any
possible
finding
of
general
identifiable
and
he
found
a
mere
possibility
of
the
identifiable
limited
to
an
obviously
small
and
discrete
number
of
persons
who
met
all
the
following
requirements.
this
must
be
persons
who
know
the
plaintiff
and
who
know
of
the
existence
of
the
doctor
and
who
know
now,
now
mind
you
in
1973
and
1974,
the
plaintiff
and
the
doctor
had
a
doctor-patient
relationship
that
ended
more
than
10
years
ago.
and
even
there,
justice
silverman
merely
speculated
that
those
might
be
the
only
ones
or
that
the
only
ones
whom
might
be
able
to
know
would
be
persons
who
would
be
within
that
discrete
group.
i
submit
that
the
justice
at
special
term
and
the
appellant
division,
which
affirm
the
justice
special
term
and
the
court
of
appeals,
had
an
equal
basis
in
the
record
for
finding
that
normal
standards
of
disguise
for
cases
free
publication
were
met
and
as
much
as
plaintiffs
were
given
false
first
names.
plaintiffs
were
given
no
last
names.
no
location
was
indicated.
the
patient's
family
group
was
radically
altered,
fictionalized
so
as
to
make
it
appear
that
they
had
only
one
child
when
in
fact
they
had
two
children.
the
book
was
not
published
until
10
years
post
treatment
and
after
the
divorce
and
the
death
of
the
husband.
and
all
that
plaintiff
was
able
to
produce
in
the
three
months
between
the
publication
and
the
injunction
to
support
her
claim
of
identifiability
was
a
single
affidavit
of
a
friend
which
does
not
refer
to
even
a
single
one
of
the
34
allegedly
identifying
characteristics,
which
plaintiff
herself
identified
in
her
moving
affidavit.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no
court
has
ever
so
held.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
justice
stewart,
my
submission
is
that
if
there
would
be
a
complete
and
total
identification
such
as
for
example,
if
the
identifying
information
in
the
kinsey
institute
of
sex
research
files
were
suddenly
to
be
made
public.
i
would
concede
that
with
appropriate
safeguards
or
hearing
and
testimony
and
cross
examination
to
have
some
things,
the
truth
of
those
allegations
that
injunctive
relief
would
be
permissible
and
a
prior
restraint
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
if
there
was
a
sufficient
identification
in
breached
of
a
professional
attorney-client
relationship
where
in
fact
that
identification
have
been
established
and
where
in
fact
it
was
not
consent.
i
would
have
to
answer
in
the
affirmative
to
your
question
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
i
would
assume
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
do
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
we
do
not
maintain,
mr.
justice
stewart
as
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
would
be
up
to
the
state,
your
honor,
but
it
would
be
subject
to
any
cause,
any
underlying
cause
of
action
being
subject
to
constitutional
limitations
which
would
not
impermissibly
infringe
on
first
--
guarantees.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
say
that
it
would
have
to
meet
all
of
the
standards
with
this
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
procedural
standards,
mr.
justice
stewart
which
this
court
has
said,
must
be
met
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
agree
with
you
your
honor's
hypothetical
suggestion
that
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
command
of
the
first
amendment
mr.
justice
douglas
is
in
terms
absolutely.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
for
purposes
of
my
argument,
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
must
take
the
first
amendment
as
it
comes
to
me
in
decisions
of
this
court
beginning
with
near
against
minnesota.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
again,
i
would
have
to
say
that
in
near
against
minnesota
this
court
sat
down.
the
absolute
proscription
against
prior
restraints
pointed
out
the
nature
of
prior
restraint
and
violation
of
the
first
amendment
and
indicated
the
absolutely
limited
and
demarcated
conditions
and
circumstances
under
which
exceptions
could
be
permitted.
exceptions
being
permitted
perhaps
in
the
field
of
obscenity,
perhaps
in
the
area
of
national
security,
even
though
this
court
declined
to
allow
prior
restraint
in
the
new
york
times
pentagon
papers
case
not
withstanding
allegations
of
national
security
issues
being
in
state.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
there
is
no
such
rule
and
indeed
the
justice
its
special
term
and
the
appellate
division
indicated
that
either
party
or
both
parties
could
apply
for
a
preference
of
the
trial
if
they
wish.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
because
of
the
unique
circumstances
of
this
case,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
such.
that
it
was
counsel's
view
representing
the
defendants
in
this
case
that
a
trial
in
the
face
of
a
preliminary
injunction
and
without
adequate
pretrial
discovery
of
a
plaintiff
who
makes
allegations
that
she's
identified
throughout
a
1,000
page
book
and
can
be
recognized
by
persons
going
back
to
her
earliest
childhood
and
there
are
such
allegations
which
are
made,
that
to
undertake
the
trial
of
that
kind,
it
would
have
not
been
proper
and
expeditious
to
do,
unless
there
have
been
adequate
and
complete
pretrial
discovery.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
assume
that
the
answer
to
that
would
have
to
be
yes,
but
that
would
have
to
be
under
the
direction
of
the
justice
to
whom
the
application
for
preliminary
injunction
has
made.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
again,
i
would
have
to
speculate
but
obviously
there
was
a
great
push
on
the
part
of
my
advisories
for
the
quick
as
possible
decision
by
the
justice's
special
term.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
after
having
read
the
preliminary
injunction
what
i
might
say
was
respect
to
the
justice's
special
term
the
baseless
preliminary
injunction
and
opinions
supporting
it
and
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
division.
it
was
our
view
that
there
was
of
course
to
follow
would
be
to
seek
reversal
of
the
preliminary
injunction
by
of
courts
in
the
appellate
system.
it
was
our
view
that
there
was
a
prior
restraint
on
publication
in
effect
and
we
just
had
to
find
the
court
with
power
to
dissolve
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
think
that's
clear
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
held
that
a
decision
of
a
state
court
even
though
a
nominally
interrogatory,
is
final
for
purpose
of
section
1257,
if
it
concerns
an
important
question
of
national
policy
and
i
believe
that's
precisely
what
this
court
held
in
the
kiff
case,
and
it's
difficult
to
conceive
of
anymore
important
national
policy
i
respectfully
submit.
then
that
which
is
so
frequently
rearticulated
by
this
court
that
there
was
a
presumptive
invalidity
to
a
prior
restrained
on
expression.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
say
yes
your
honor,
it's
a
year
and
five
months.
i
suppose
i
would
have
to
stand
by
the
first
amendment
and
take
the
view
that
even
a
day
of
a
prior
restrain
is
an
assault
which
has
to
be
justified
by
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
think
it
is
deeply
reasonable
to
assume
mr.
chief
justice,
then
the
light
of
the
opinion
on
special
term
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
appellate
division,
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
would
be
most
unlikely
are
in
the
court,
rather
this
court,
to
have
dissolve
the
injunction
before
the
case
have
gone
its
way.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
do
not
think
i
would
be
here
today
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
respectfully
submit
that
my
argument
is
more
than
that,
it
is
not
just
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
its
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
a
prior
restraint
preliminary
injunction
cannot
be
entered
on
the
basis
of
a
record
which
has
as
deficient
as
this
record
is,
and
that
any
underlying
cause
of
action
whatever
it
is
and
i
doubt
if
anyone
can
read
the
mélange
of
opinions
from
special
term
and
from
the
appellate
division
and
ascertain
what
the
cause
of
action
was
suppose
to
be.
but
that
there
has
to
be
an
articulated
cause
of
action.
there
has
to
be
an
indication
of
harm
to
the
patient
from
identification,
there
has
to
be
findings
of
insufficiency
of
disguise
and
the
identification
and
the
judge
has
to
say
so
in
his
opinion.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
some
of
the
things
that
this
court
said
in
the
case
of
mayo
against
canning
about
which
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
argument
was
proceeded
mine
even
thought
the
court
of
course
was
doing
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
of
course
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
it
is
possible
to
at
least
see
some
due
process
laws
or
some
notions
of
due
process
laws
at
least
in
some
of
the
words
of
mr.
justice
roberts
in
mayo
against
canning
company.
and
i
believe
that
the
talks
about
the
statement
of
fact
are
mingled
with
arguments
and
inferences,
for
which
we
find
no
sufficient
basis
other
than
the
affidavits
or
in
oral
testimony,
in
our
case
of
course
there
was
no
oral
testimony.
and
such
finding
is
there
are
they
can
be
called
findings
run
in
petitioner's
favor.
but,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
a
suggestions
in
that
opinion
that
this
intermingling
of
arguments
and
inferences
and
this
absence
of
elucidated
statements
in
fact,
is
precisely
what
makes
difficult
if
not
impossible
the
course
of
appellate
review.
and
therefore,
i
think
it's
possible
to
read
from
that
case
in
due
process
clause
as
to
the
views
of
this
court.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
don't
wish
to
be
vague
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
justice
white
but
all
that
i
can
say
is
that
learning
amicus
representing
the
american
psychiatric
associations
and
two
other
world
organizations
have
postulated
five
different
possible
theories
of
liability,
and
said
that
it's
unclear
which
of
them
or
which
combinations
of
them
would
be
involved.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
would
suppose
that
it
would
be
possible
for
a
state
court
to
formulate
a
standard
of
liability
based
on
the
breach
of
the
confidential
relationship
between
a
professional
person
and
someone
coming
to
see
the
professional
person,
assuming
that
all
of
the
standards
have
been
met
and
that
all
of
the
procedural
necessities
have
been
met.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
submit
that
those
are
the
issues
which
are
in
the
case
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
my
advisory
has
suggested
in
this
brief
and
that
there
might
be
a
constitutional
right
of
privacy
which
we
justify
and
action
by
the
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
but
as
--
that
is
the
way
the
cause
of
actions
is
played
mr.
justice
stewart
but
to
indicate
the
difficulties
and
attempting
to
comprehend
what
happened
in
the
state
courts
of
new
york.
the
decision
which
is
cited
by
the
appellate
division
is
this
courts
decisions
in
the
abortion
cases
is
suggesting
that
there
is
a
merging
constitutional
right
of
privacy,
how
that
can
be
read
into
this
case
is
beyond
me
but
there
it
is.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
was
able
to
glance
at
it,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
kent
roe
case
mr.
chief
justice
turns
on
one
of
the
recognized
subdivisions
which
has
been
establish
in
the
state
law
of
many
states
and
i
believe
appears
in
the
reinstatement
of
the
false
light
notion
of
a
cause
of
actions
for
privacy
violation.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
all
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
says
and
i
hope
i
have
not
left
anything
out
in
my
brief
reading,
is
that
the
law
is
still
the
law
as
it
was
handed
down
by
this
court
in
time
against
hill,
and
nothing
which
may
have
been
said
or
may
have
been
intimated
or
which
anyone
may
seek
to
try
to
derive
from
the
decisions
by
this
court
in
the
2534
case
changes
the
law
in
time
against
hill.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
we
urge
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
thank
you
and
we
urge
that
the
standard
of
time
against
hill
which
is
the
only
occasion
when
this
court
posited
a
standard
of
liability
in
the
case
of
a
confrontation
between
an
alleged
violation
of
right
or
privacy
and
the
first
amendment
is
the
only
standard
which
is
applicable
here.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes
of
course,
but
i
do
agree
that
the
case
is
stronger
but
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
--
i've
not
overlooked
it,
mr.
justice
douglas.
i
never
overlooked
any
of
the
descents
written
by
any
of
the
members
of
this
court,
but
as
i
said
before
and
it's
add
up
to
the
chief
justice's
question
that
perhaps
that
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
that
a
lawyer
arguing
before
the
bar
of
this
court
has
to
take
the
first
amendment
as
its
come
down
from
decisions
of
this
court
and
that
is
exactly
how
we
urge
this
court
should
treat
this
case
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
from
near
to
date
this
is
clearly
an
impermissible
private
restraint
and
any
acts
of
semantics
or
overlooking
or
exceptionalizations
which
have
been
attempted
other
by
my
learned
advisory
or
in
the
decisions
of
the
new
york
courts
simply
will
not
wash
when
compared
against
the
clear
writing
of
chief
justice
hughes
in
there
against
minnesota
and
in
the
decisions
since
then.
with
the
courts
permission
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
i'm
delighted
that
my
learned
adversary
now
agrees
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction,
when
we'd
not
have
known
that
from
reading
his
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari.
with
respect
to
the
presumption,
it
is
evident
that
respondent's
position
is
lost
without
the
presumption,
because
it's
evident
that
the
basic
finding
in
this
case
is
the
finding
which
was
made
by
mr.
justice
silverman,
a
special
term,
which
has
in
fact
and
affirmed
by
the
appellate
division
just
modifying
the
relief
granted
there
from,
and
also
affirmed
regrettably
without
opinion
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
most
that
can
be
found
from
that
finding
i
say
is
as
mr.
justice
white
observed
is
an
implication
but
even
there
an
implication
which
is
insulated
by
a
double
negative.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
due
process
means
anything,
and
if
the
special
kind
of
due
process
which
is
necessary
before
one
grants
a
presumptively
unconstitutionally
invalid
prior
restraint.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
absolutely.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
do
not
say
that
it
is
awfully
hard
to
tell,
what
i
do
say
that
it
is
impossible
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
sir,
special
term
did
not
find
that
the
plaintiff
could
be
identified
by
anyone
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
you
can't
find
a
law
in
there
which
even
hits
that.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
had
been
taken.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
it
had
been
taken,
that's
right.
and
i
think
i
have
to
win
on
that.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
fact
is
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
mr.
london
had
three
months.
mr.
london
and
his
client
had
three
months
and
they
submitted
one
slim
affidavit
by
a
friend
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
in
that
is
the
customary,
if
not
the
required
practice.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
preliminary
injunctions
in
new
york.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
your
honor.
of
course
not.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
of
course
not,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
assume
that
these
witnesses
would
be
subjective
to
cross
examination
of
course,
and
i
presume
that
the
trial
of
the
facts
would
have
an
opportunity
to
evaluate
this
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
your
argument
follows
completely
if
this
were
not
the
case
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
prior
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
if
these
were
not
the
case
where
there
has
been
a
prior
restraint
against
a
concededly,
scientific,
none
up
seen
book
which
has
now
been
in
effect
for
more
than
one
year.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
crucial
first
amendment
question,
which
has
not
received
any
attention
at
all
by
the
courts
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
which
must
recieve
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
yes
it
certainly
was.
but
i
saw
it
as
my
burden
to
attempt
to
relieve
the
injunction
and
to
seek
whatever
tribunals
could
be
found
with
the
power
and
the
authority,
and
the
motivation,
and
the
understanding
of
the
first
amendment
to
do
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no
application
was
made
by
me
for
a
stay
of
the
injunction,
because
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no
mr.
justice
white,
but
we
did
go
to
the
appellate
division
on
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
an
expedited
preferred
schedule.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
certainly,
unless
the
findings
have
been
made,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
i
have
not
asked
for
a
stay,
i
have
relied
on
seeking
appeals
on
the
merits
as
quickly
as
possible.
thank
you
very
much.
