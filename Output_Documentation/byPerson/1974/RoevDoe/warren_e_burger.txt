chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1446,
roe
and
others
against
doe.
mr.
karpatkin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
in
the
appendix
do
we
find
that
or
is
it
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
which
way
do
you
think
the
time
factor
works
again
in
relation
to
the
kiff
case,
as
i
recall
it
in
the
kiff
case
the
temporary
injunction
have
been
in
effect
for
about
three
years,
here
it's
a
little
bit
over
one
year.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
same
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
passing
to
you,
whether
you
have
a
final
judgment
in
the
kiff
case,
i
think
the
court
took
on
pains
to
say
or
indicate
that
temporary
injunction
having
continued
for
three
years
that
was
reasonable,
so
that
was
quite
permanent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
it
suppose
to
little
early
to
expect
that
read
mr.
justice
stewart's
opinion
in
the
case
that
came
down
this
morning
or
perhaps
you
did
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
read
that
during
lunch
hour.
well,
was
that
something
like
this
kind
of
a
case,
so
do
you
think
or
not
that
was
a
tort,
a
claim
for
violations
of
privacy
that
sounds
in
tort?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
london.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
disagree
with
that
challenge
that
figure
3,000
volumes
copies
of
the
book
come
in
than
published?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
new
york
law
did
the
trial
court
not
lose
jurisdiction,
and
some
hasn't
appeared
in
this
file?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
who's
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
of
being
able
to
do
anything
about
it
without
leaving
the
appellate
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
saying
in
effect
to
the
actively
publishing
of
this
book,
or
i'll
put
it
as
a
question,
are
you
saying
that
the
act
of
publishing
this
book
was
the
same
as
taking
all
of
these
notes
and
files,
and
putting
them
in
the
public
library
where
everybody
could
look
at
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
your
thesis,
that
is
conduct
not
reference.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
that
you
are
arguing
from
that
this
would
mean
her
identity
would
be
widely
known
in
the
psychiatric
circles.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
specifically
that
group
if
she
was
identifiable
to
some
psychiatrist
it
would
readily
expand,
i
take
it
that's
part
of
your
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
it
by
stipulation
either,
isn't
it?
that
doesn't
mean
the
we
can't
as
justice
blackmun
suggests
that
concludes
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
--
it
was
not
easy
if
you
read
the
giff
case
closely.
it
was
not
easy
for
the
court
to
find
jurisdiction
there.
and
i
think
there
were
some
indication
of
an
almost
abandonment
by
one
party
of
any
effort
to
challenge
the
temporary
injunction.
there's
no
such
factor
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
you
say
you've
been
actively
engaged
on
it
until
a
week
ago,
wasn't
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
to
this
supplement,
you're
in
respond
to
the
reply
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
london.
mr.
karpatkin,
you
have
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
then
you
went
beyond
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
went
beyond
that
and
qualified
to
this
finding
and
let's
assume
hypothetically
that
you
went
to
trial
on
that
permanent
injunction.
and
mr.
london
brought
in
25
people
who
had
said,
“yes,
they
read
this
book
without
having
any
knowledge
of
the
background.
and
from
reading
that
book
they
could
identify
the
patient.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
what
you
have
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
always
try
a
permanent
injunction
on
that
matter
of
affidavits
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
always
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
speaking
of
permanent
injunction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
could,
he
would
be,
and
he
certainly
could
not
be
denied
the
opportunity
to
bring
him
25
witnesses
could
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
that
though,
for
all
the
assumption
that
the
25
witnesses
said
yes,
i
read
this
book
and
never
heard
about
it
before
mr.
london
asked
me
who
he
is.
from
a
reading
of
that
book
i
put
these
factors
together
and
i
identified
this
patient
as
dr.
x.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
mr.
justice
white
has
suggested
presumably
make
some
findings
of
fact
and
then
we
wouldn't
engage
in
this
extensive
cross
examination
that
both
of
you
gentlemen
to
try
to
find
out
some
of
these
things,
would
we,
if
we
need
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
question
maybe
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whose
burden
was
it
to
hurry
that
case
on
for
trial?
the
restraint
was
against
you,
your
client,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
73-1446,
roe
and
coe
against
doe.
i
have
an
opinion
for
the
court
to
announce
in
that
the
writ
--
the
disposition
of
the
court
and
that
the
writ
of
certiorari
previously
granted
is
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
