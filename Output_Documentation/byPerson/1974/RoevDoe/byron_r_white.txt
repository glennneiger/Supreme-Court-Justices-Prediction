that
was
the
first
amendment
directs
itself
to
congress
and
we're
not
dealing
it
with
literally.
were
not
dealing
here
within
a
congress
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wonder,
back
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart
you
indicated
that
under
that
thing
and
the
attorneys
example
he
gave
that
there
state
would
have
power
who
in
such
injunction,
was
that
answer
based
on
the
reach
of
the
confidential
relationship
that
was
inherit
in
mr.
justice
stewart's
questions
or
was
it
the
nature
of
the
disclosure,
so
that
would
be
upon
fully
aside
from
whether
they
would
have
reach
any
confidential
initiative?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
gave--
you
answered
mr.
justice
stewart
however,
i
wondered
what's
basis
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
partially
implied
--
applied
there
was
identification
for
perhaps
with
respect
with
anybody
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
aspect
--
fact
finding
why
this
case
comes
to
us
based
on
what
you
find
in
the
special
term
and
the
appellant
division
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
mean
what
--
how
does
the
case
come
to
us
with
respect
to
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
summarize,
just
for
me,
what
is
the
fact
finding
with
respect
to
identification?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
that's
the
extent
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
karpatkin,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
said
at
least
that
whether
there's
identification
or
not,
it's
a
rather
important
fact
in
arriving
at
some
resolution
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it's
awfully
hard
to
tell
what
the
facts
are
from
the
opinions
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
if
it's
rather
hard
to
grapple
with
some
legal
issues.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
at
least
special
term
did
not
find
that
your
client
or
that
the
plaintiff
could
not
be
identified
them
on
prints.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know.
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
special
term
did
indicate
that
the
normal
precautions
to
avoid
identification
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
went
beyond
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
any
request
for
a
stay
of
the
injunction
turned
down
or
pending
to
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
didn't
make
any
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
if
one
your
possible
arguments
would
mean
that
unless
and
until
the
plaintiff
who
brought
this
suit
convinces
a
court
to
make
the
kind
of
findings
that
would
work
a
prior
restraint,
that
there
shouldn't
be
a
prior
restraint
pending
in
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
haven't
asked
for
any
stay
of--
