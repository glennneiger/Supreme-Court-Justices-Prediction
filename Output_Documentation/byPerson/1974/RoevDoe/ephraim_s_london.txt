mr.
ephraim
s.
london
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
now,
this
doesn't
involve
the
simple
case
of
publication
of
the
case
history
that
is
being
enjoined.
what
we
have
in
this
case
is
a
patient's
confidences
divulge
to
her
psychiatrist
copied
almost
verbatim.
notes
made
during
each
psychiatric
session
between
the
psychiatrist
and
her
patient,
who
is
the
respondent
in
this
case,
and
the
patient's
husband,
and
those
notes
written
at
lenght
after
the
sessions
and
then
made
into
a
book
and
as
i
understand
from
the
brief
of
the
amicus
in
this
case,
the
american
psychiatric
associations.
in
these
sessions,
a
patient
is
encouraged
to
dredge
up
from
the
unconscious
thoughts
that
would
never
be
expressed.
memories
that
had
been
too
distressing
to
keep
in
mind
and
the
like,
and
all
these
were
written
down,
where
a
vote
by
the
psychiatrist
questions,
were
then
written
down
and
then
publish
and
they
relate
to
such
matters
as
the
patient's
thoughts
during
intercourse,
her
husband's
masturbation,
her
own
masturbation,
her
fantasies
about
incest,
then
the
like,
all
these
then
published
in
a
book
and
retailed
in
and
discount
houses,
department
stores,
trade
bookstores
even
music
stores.
this
is
the
kind
of
book
and
this
is
the
problem
that
we
have
here
today
and
this
is
again
just
not
a
case
history.
i
can't
imagine
the
situation
in
which
there
has
been
a
greater
assault
on
a
persons
dignity,
on
a
person's
self
respect
to
have
these
thoughts
said
out
for
one's
neighbors,
for
one's
children,
for
one's
students
to
read
because
patient
here
is
an
assistant
professor
in
the
university.
she
is
herself
a
psychotherapist,
one
can't
imagine
what
would
happen
if
this
got
into
the
hands
of
her
pupils
or
her
own
patients
or
her
own
children
or
her
own
friends.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
i
don't
know
your
honor,
i
think
as
the
statement
made
by
the
psychiatrist
here
and
we
have
no
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
pardon
me.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
oh,
it's
a
statement
made
which
we
haven't
verified
as
yet,
and
i'm
going
to
come
to
this
question
of
the
status
of
the
case
and
why
we
are
so
little
advance
and
why
a
year
and
half
had
past
since
the
preliminary
injunction
was
granted.
now,
the
first
preliminary
injunction
on
this
case
was
an
injunction
which
prevented
the
sale
only
in
the
trade
stores
and
the
department
stores,
and
in
the
discount
houses
put
a
large
sale,
in
medical
schools,
in
libraries
who
dealt
with
scientific
books
and
the
like,
and
as
soon
as
that
injunction
was
issue
the
limited
injunction
was
issued
we
representing
the
patient
wrote
a
letter
to
the
court
saying
we
would
like
an
immediate
trial
and
we
suggest
that
the
court
allow
ten
days
for
pretrial
examination,
pretrial
discovery
before
the
full
trial
starts
and
we
receive
no
response,
that
letter
is
that
a91
of
the
record.
we
received
no
response,
the
order
or
the
injunction,
the
limited
injunction
was
slightly
modified
and
the
case
was
assigned
to
a
judge
for
all
purposes
including
trial
and
we
wrote
that
judge
and
we
said,
“may
we
have
an
immediate
trial?”
and
the
attorney
for
the
psychiatrist
wrote
back
and
said,
“we
don't
join
in
that
application,
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
probably
we'll
appeal,”
and
this
is
a
very
complicated
case
and
we
want
our
learned
pretrial
examinations.
now
of
course,
the
appeals
were
taken,
so
that
it
wouldn't
been
difficult
to
have
at
trial,
and
new
york
state
could
have
been
secured
without
any
difficulty
i
think
your
honor,
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
that
question
before
and
a
state
would
be
issued
on
appeal,
the
state
of
the
trial
of
the
question
of
the
right
to
injunction
were
challenged.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
well,
retain
jurisdiction
of
the
case
you
honor.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
i
think
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
apply
to
the
appellate
court
for
stay
but
those
stays
are
automatically
granted.
as
indeed,
they
should
be
if
there
is
a
real
question
to
be
determined.
but
now,
coming
back
to
this
procedure
here
as
i
said
when
the
case
was
assigned
to
a
judge
for
trial
and
for
all
other
purposes
we
again
ask
for
the
immediate
trial
and
we
again
had
the
opposition
of
the
psychiatrist
here.
and
they
said
they
had
a
law
in
pretrial
examination
and
indeed,
it
occupied
a
longer
period
of
time
because
of
his
completed
only
last
week,
exactly
one
week
ago.
and
we
got
it
completed
only
by
applying
to
the
court
to
compel
that
completion
of
the
examination,
but
only
the
parts
of
six
days
and
now
according
from
the
psychiatrist's
brief,
the
reply
brief
only
the
parts
of
six
days
were
taken
over
this
year
and
half,
that
examination
before
trial.
so
that
any
delay
or
duration
of
this
preliminary
injunction
is
entirely
the
fault
of
the
psychiatrist
here
and
indeed,
over
the
opposition
of
the
patient,
who
wanted
a
quick
trial
on
disposition
of
this
case.
now,
mr.
karpatkin
stated
an
answer
to
a
question
of
mr.
justice
stewart
that
if
there
were
identification
of
the
patient
in
this
book,
an
injunction
could
issue
at
the
trial.
and
i
think
that
virtually
dispossess
of
the
case.
may
i
first
tell
you
factually
what
the
identification
in
the
book
is,
the
book
does
give
fictitious
names
to
the
parties
and
says
they
are
fictitious.
but
then
goes
on
to
give
a
great
many
details
of
the
lives
of
these
people
indicates
that
the
patient's
husband
was
a
professional
speech
writer.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
i
wanted
to
show
that
there's
a
factor
of
base
for
identification
because
mr.
karpatkin
and
says
if
there
is
identification,
then
there
is
an
end
to
the
matter.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
mr.
karpatkin
failed
to
indicate
that
that
was
modified
by
the
appellate
division,
and
it's
no
longer
a
holding
that
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
no,
it
what
it
says
that
the
claim
justification
for
publication,
the
attempt
to
disguise
her
identity
does
not
provides
sufficiently
valid
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
i
think
so
but
i
think
we
can
go
great
deal
further
your
honor
and
say
that
it
is
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
certainly
not.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
may
i
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
may
i
say
your
honor
that
as
i
understand
the
law
you
should
not
and
may
i
expand
on
that
for
just
a
moment
of
does
your
honor
have
some
other
question?
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
well,
i
still
think
we
have
a
cause
action
your
honor.
i
think
we
have
a
cause
of
action
base
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
unquestionably
of
violation
of
statute
and
that
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
i
mean
implied
contract
between
the
parties.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
new
york
could
on
two
basis.
one
basis
is
there
has
been
a
violation
of
statute
given
rise
to
a
cause
of
action
without
identification.
the
law
is
very
clear
and
says
the
doctor
may
not
disclose.
it
doesn't
say
and
identify
in
the
cause
of
disclosure.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
no,
no,
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
cause
of
action
exist
and
i
think
that
the
cause
of
the
action
exist
just
by
the
publication
because
the
patient
has
been
injured
by
that
publication.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
again,
the
answer
i
believe
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
as
i
understand
the
first
amendment
it
applies
to
speech
but
where
conduct
is
prohibited
by
a
lawful
statute.
the
mere
fact
that
that
conduct
is
progated
with
communication
that
is
that
conduct
comes
in
to
effect
though
communication
doesn't
prevent,
the
first
amendment
does
not
prevent
in
such
a
situation.
the
interference
with
the
communication,
the
communication
may
be
interfered
with
because
the
interference
is
essentially
with
conduct
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
the
conduct
is
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
the
conduct
is
the
disclosure
of
the
patient's
secrets.
the
betrayal
of
the
patient's
confidence,
that
is
the
conduct
your
honor.
and
it
is
accomplished
through
book,
it
would
be
conduct
if
it
was
expressed
orally
and
it
doesn't
become
sacred
because
it
is
a
book.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
yes,
your
honor.
except
giving
it
wider
publicity,
then
that
it
might
receive
if
it
were
merely
put
into
the
library.
but
may
i
return
to
this
question--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
of
this
particular
nature,
i
think
not
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
not
without
the
agreement
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
i've
quoted
dr.
freud
to
the
effect
that
no
matter
what
happens,
one
must
not
do
anything
to
betray
the
patient,
and
if
one
is
faced
with
the
necessity
of
not
publishing
or
betraying
the
patient
one
does
not
publish.
but
again,
there
is
a
statute
here
and
may
i
speak
a
little
of
new
york
practice.
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
is
a
court
of
very
limited
jurisdiction.
and
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
provides
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
not
pass
questions
of
pact,
that
by
the
way
is
set
out
of
page
1a
in
the
appendix.
the
court
of
appeals
may
not
review
any
question
or
fact
at
all,
unless
the
appellate
division
in
an
interlocutory
judgment,
finds
new
facts
or
in
it's
auto
granting
leave
to
appeal
new
facts
are
set
forth.
now,
i
think
almost
every
practitioner
in
that
court
knows
that
rule
and
in
point
or
should
know
the
rule
and
then
there
is
another
statute,
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
pass
upon
questions
of
law
in
the
context
of
a
particular
case
and
in
the
context
or
facts.
there
is
a
statute,
5612,
which
is
again
in
the
appendix
which
provides
that
if
there
are
not
new
findings
or
fact
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
or
in
its
order
or
in
the
auto
granting
leave
to
appeal
then
the
court
of
appeals
must
assume
that
those
facts
were
determined
in
favor
of
the
party
who
is
the
respondent,
who
is
the
patient
here.
and
questionably
there
is
a
disputed
fact
here,
at
least
there
is
disagreement
with
respect
to
whether
there
was
identification.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
yes,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
--
because
there
were
many
who
knew
of
her
doctor.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
we,
we,
we
could
your
honor
but
we
can
go
very
much
further
because
we
say
that
the
patient
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
i
think
we
do
your
honor
on
that
alone,
but
it
does
go
much
further
and
may
i
just
speak
once
again
for
a
moment
about
this
statutory
presumption
that
the
identification
was
found
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
bound
by
that.
mr.
karpatkin,
the
attorney
for
the
psychiatrist
in
case
wrote
a
reply
brief
in
which
he
complained
three
times.
but
he's
not
bound
by
this
section
because
it
wasn't
a
call
to
his
attention
and
the
court
of
appeals,
and
he
says
we
must
have
waived
that
right
to
rely
on
this
rule
of
practice,
because
it
wasn't
discussed
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
he
discusses
this
as
a
kind
of
arcane
statute,
that's
his
word.
there's
nothing
mysterious
or
secret
about
this
statute,
it's
published
in
all
of
the
book
practice.
and
in
permanent
inc
and
in
point
of
fact
we
did
call
mr.
karpatkin's
attention
to
that
section
in
our
court
of
appeals
brief
although
he
three
times
denied
that
we
did.
at
page
14
of
our
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals,
we
did
discussed
the
section,
we
said
the
court
must
presume
to
any
question,
in
fact
in
dispute,
were
resolved
by
the
appellate
division
in
favor
of
the
respondent.
and
then
cited
civil
practice
law
and
rules
5612b.
may
i,
by
the
way
have
the
court's
permission
to
respond
to
some
errors,
misstatements
of
fact
in
the
reply
brief
by
the
letter
to
this
court?
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
i'm
just
trying
to
say
you
find
it
my
favor.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
i'm
sorry.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
i
think
it
is
the
much
more
favorable
finding
that
is
binding
upon
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
no,
no.
the
fact
is
that
this
is
by
operation
of
law.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
patient
here,
that
she
is
easily
identified
by
a
large
number
of
unique
facts
of
her
life,
so
that
anyone
who
knew
her
and
read
the
book
would
be
able
to
identify.
or
in
fact,
a
lady
did
identify,
we
have
her
as
a
witness
in
the
case
below.
now,
it
is
that
broad
question
of
identification
that
we
say
is
binding
by
reason
of
a
statute.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
no,
your
honor,
because
your
honors
assuming
a
situation
which
i
would
representing
the
appellant.
and
the
appellant
is
the
one
that
has
the
facts
resolved
against
the
appellant.
it
is
not
the
respondent,
that
doesn't
work
us
against
the
respondent
at
all
it
works
only
in
the
respondent's
favor,
where
a
particular
manner
and
method
of
appeal
is
taken.
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
mr.
karpatkin
had
the
option
of
requesting
findings
a
fact
that
the
appellant
division
and
invariably
they
are
granted,
it
may
have
been
those
findings
would
have
been
against
him.
and
it
maybe
for
that
reason
that
he
did
not
want
to
ask
the
court
to
make
specific
findings
or
fact
but
he
certainly
did
not
make
those
findings.
in
any
attorney
who
wants
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
have
questions
of
disputed
facts
considered
by
that
court
must
raise
those
questions
or
fact
and
they
were
not
raised
by
the
psychiatrist
in
this
case
not
even
in
the
request
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
request
indicates
that
the
appeal
was
sort
only
on
the
question
of
fact,
i
mean
on
the
question
of
law
i'm
sorry,
and
that
no
disputed
questions
of
fact.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
no,
your
honor.
only
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
the
case
comes
to
you
as
to
the
facts
with
the
appellate
division
opinion,
which
modified
the
court
at
special
term
and
in
addition
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
the
fact
finding
with
respect
to
identification
is
that
the
patient
was
readily
identifiable
from
the
text
of
the
book
and
anyone
who
knew
the
patient,
although
the
name
did
not
appear
in
the
book
would
immediately
know
that
she
was
the
subject
to
the
book.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
that
is
the
extent
of
it
and
no
less
your
honor.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
widely
known
and
certainly
in
any
people
who
knew
her
and
who
knew
the
events
of
her
life.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
well,
that
would
be
it
but
it
would
be
known
i
think
to
anybody
who
knew
that
her
husband
was
a
man
who
began
to
practice
the
law
at
the
age
of
50
and
prior
at
that
time
had
been
a
speech
writer
and
that
she
had
a
son
that
was
a
musical
prodigy.
these
are
relatively
unique
facts.
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
i
don't
see
that
we
have
a
final
judgment
your
honor,
but
i
think
this
comes
within
the
exception
that
case
law
has
made.
i
think
the
case
was
properly
before
the
court,
i
did
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
yes,
your
honor.
but
there
was
the
giff
case,
the
organization
for
giff
case,
in
which
a
preliminary
injunction
did
in
fact
come
before
this
court,
and
the
court
stated
that
it
had
jurisdiction,
and
we
are
not
contesting
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
in
this
case.
i
understood--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
oh,
no.
no,
there
isn't
that
fact
in
this
case
and
we
are
stipulating
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
yes,
your
honor.
on
the
examinations
before
trial
alone
i
understood
from
your
honors
now
that
we
may
send
you
a
letter
and
i
--
mr.
ephraim
s.
london
i
would
just
like
to
add
one
word
with
respect
to
the
procedures
that
are
followed
before
preliminary
injunction
is
granted.
in
new
york
state,
preliminary
injunction
is
merely
an
adjunct
to
the
final
injunction
that
may
be
granted
or
denied.
and
it
is
a
temporary
order
granted
simply
to
be
certain
that
if
final
relief
is
given
to
the
plaintiff
in
the
case,
that
final
relief
will
not
be
meaningless,
because
if
the
temporary
injunction
was
not
granted
we
would
have
the
sale
of
the
book
and
it
wouldn't
have
done
us
any
good
after
a
period
of
time
to
get
the
final
injunction.
now,
you
did
have
evidence
submitted
by
affidavit,
you
did
have
all
argument
briefs,
all
the
requirements
of
due
process
are
met,
even
the
demand
that
a
valid
cause
of
action
be
proved
before
the
injunction
can
be
granted.
there
is—it
was
indicated
before
a
right
even
to
ask
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
with
respect
to
any
crucial
fact,
any
crucial
disputed
fact.
and
mr.
karpatkin's
only
complained
about
that
right
or
about
that
section
allowing
a
hearing
on
the
disputed
fact
is
that
if
he
asked
for
it,
the
court
might
have
refused
to
give
it
to
him,
because
the
fact
in
this
case
are
complex,
they
certainly
aren't
complex,
they
couldn't
be
simpler.
all
that
we
have
here
is
a
simple
problem
of
the
book,
the
revelations
in
the
book,
and
the
problem
of
identification
which
i
think
is
evident
from
the
book
itself.
thank
you.
