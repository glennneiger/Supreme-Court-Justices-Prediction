do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
only
prospect
the
dividend
is
that
to
operate
in
cost
go
down?
justice

marshall
because
if
that's
true,
i
doubt
that
anybody
assumes
that
as
of
today,
did
it?
that
operating
cost
will
go
down?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
we
go
to
the
river
bay
or
whatever
it
is
the
corporation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
economic
reality
that
you
can't
get
the
lease
without
the
stock?
