mr.
paul
gonson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
we
have,
as
has
been
noted,
15,000
persons
who
have
paid
over
$32
million
to
purchase
over
$1
million
shares
of
stock
in
a
cooperative
housing
corporation.
and
the
funds,
those
$32
million
were
utilized
by
that
corporation
in
the
construction
of
that
apartment
project.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
submits
that
their
allegations
are
fraud,
which
are
based
upon
documents
that
were
given
to
them
in
connection
with
that
project,
should
be
heard
under
the
federal
securities
laws.
now
these
persons
executed
essentially
two
documents
as
i
understand.
one
was
a
subscription
agreement
to
buy
stock.
the
other
was
an
occupancy
agreement
which
was
in
effect
a
lease.
mr.
paul
gonson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
it's
important
that
there
were
two
of
them.
and
in
this
case,
we
wish
to
emphasize
that
one
of
them
talks
about
stock.
and
that
is
very
important.
and
while
it
has
been
noted
that
of
course
substance
should
prevail
over
form,
the
fact
that
stock
is
involved
here
is
not
merely
a
question
of
form
as
perhaps
was
implicit
in
that
suggestion.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
fact
that
there
is
stock,
itself
connotes
substance.
stock
has
certain
attributes,
and
these
are
the
attributes
of
a
security.
and
that
is
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
persons
who
are
asked
to
buy
stock
may
reasonably
expect
that
they're
going
to
be
protected
by
the
laws
which
apply
to
stock.
and
why
shouldn't
they
be?
it
was
sold
to
them
as
stock.
it
wasn't
sold
to
them
as
anything
else.
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
that
a
promoters
offering
be
judged
on
what
he
represents
it
to
be.
mr.
paul
gonson
yes
sir.
we're
talking
about
--
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
your
honor.
but
as
this
court
noted
in
the
tcherepnin
case
--
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
well
the
mitchell-lama
act
provides
that
limited
profit
housing
corporations
may
issue
dividends.
mr.
paul
gonson
it
is
my
understanding,
your
honor
that
it
does.
the
records
at
167
a
and
188
a
describes
this
as
a
limited
profit
housing
corporation.
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
possibility.
we
refer
to
that
in
our
brief
at
page
15.
i
believe
it's
on
--
i
don't
have
the
--
i
believe
it's
on
page
16
of
the
appendix
your
honor.
yes,
i've
been
handed
the
by-laws
of
the
corporation
your
honor,
which
also
indicate
that
there's
a
possibility
of
dividends,
article
v,
which
is
found
in
138
of
the
record.
this
is
the
record
in
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
i
believe
spoke
of
surplus
income,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that
one
possibility
of
that
surplus
income
is
provided
in
the
mitchell-lama
act
is
the
payment
of
dividends
which
is
--
mr.
paul
gonson
they
presumably
--
mr.
paul
gonson
i
believe
that
they
could
be
paid
under
the
new
york
law
in
cash.
but
i
believe
that
the
--
probably
would
be
paid
in
the
form
of
reduction
of
rentals.
mr.
paul
gonson
but
there
was
a
surplus
from
operations
rather
than
in
cash.
mr.
paul
gonson
it
is
our
opinion,
your
honor
that
that
is
an
economic
benefit
which
when
taken
with
other
economic
benefits
constitute
a
sufficient
inducement
purchase
a
security.
mr.
paul
gonson
possibly
not,
your
honor.
i
don't
know.
i'm
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
consequence
of
the
application
of
the
income
tax
laws
to
the
situation
to
answer
that
question
fully.
it
may
very
well
be
the
kind
of
return
that
a
cooperative
pays
to
its
members
when
in
effect
it
collects
more
from
it
than
it
needs
for
operations.
i
suppose
essentially
theirs
not
income,
although
it
could
very
well
be
in
the
nature
of
a
dividend.
mr.
paul
gonson
in
--
i
believe
--
mr.
paul
gonson
well,
your
honor
you
would
come
from
a
combination
of
what
is
collected
as
against
what
it
cost
to
run
the
project.
the
surplus
as
distinguished
from
dividend
also
may
come
from
the
rentals
which
are
obtained
from
commercial
properties
which
i
understand
in
the
aggregate
came
to
more
than
$4
million
as
price.
mr.
paul
gonson
yes
they
do,
your
honor.
and
then
they're
used
in
effect
to
offset
the
monthly
accruing
charges
that
these
persons
have
to
pay.
in
addition,
in
terms
of
what
attributes
were
there,
the
stock
also
entitled
the
holder
to
a
right
to
participate
in
assets
upon
liquidation
or
dissolution.
and
finally
in
response
to
the
question
and
it
is
not
necessary,
this
court
has
said
that
stock
have
all
of
the
attributes
that
any
other
kind
of
stock
might
possibly
have.
there
is
voting
stock
and
there
is
nonvoting
stock.
there
is
of
course
that
has
cumulative
dividends
and
stock
that
doesn't.
nonetheless,
they
may
all
still
be
understood
to
be
stock.
mr.
paul
gonson
your
honor
we
might
be
making
a
somewhat
different
argument
if
that
were
the
case.
mr.
paul
gonson
we
might
still
be
here.
mr.
paul
gonson
we
might
still
be
making
that,
yes
your
honor.
but
i
would
--
mr.
paul
gonson
yes
but
i
would
like
to
emphasize
once
again
your
honor,
if
i
may,
that
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
an
interest
which
on
its
face
does
not
purport
to
be
a
security,
is
nevertheless
to
be
a
security
rather
it's
the
contrary.
it
is
the
issue
whether
something
which
purports
to
be
a
security,
a
stock,
should
nonetheless
be
held
not
to
be
a
security.
mr.
paul
gonson
no,
sir.
we're
not
taking
into
position
that
if
you
received
a
certificate
that
said
in
consideration
of
the
contribution
of
the
boy's
club,
you
have
a
share
of
stock
in
the
youth
of
america
that
that
would
be
a
share
of
stock
but
if
you
received
or
subscribed
to
stock
which
you
know
is
going
to
be
an
undivided
interest
in
a
corporation
and
which
was
going
to
carry
certain
benefits,
then
we
say
there
is
a
very
strong
presumption
at
the
outset
that
what
you
have
received
is
in
fact
a
security.
mr.
paul
gonson
yes.
i
think
in
the
end,
you
would
look
to
the
economic
reality.
and
as
this
court
said
in
the
tcherepnin
case
in
searching
for
the
meaning
and
scope
of
the
word
security,
the
emphasis
should
be
on
the
economic
reality.
and
on
this
case,
the
basic
economic
reality
of
the
transaction
here
is
the
coming
together
of
a
number
of
factors;
significance,
economic
inducements,
argument
to
persons.
they
make
an
investment
at
the
outset
that
--
mr.
paul
gonson
the
economic
realities,
your
honor
is
that
the
stock
is
a
passkey
to
the
apartment.
but
as
this
court
noted
in
the
united
benefit
case,
it
may
be
very
possible
to
have
both
a
security
and
an
insurance
contract
in
the
same
documents.
and
there
this
court
reversed
the
court
of
appeals
which
had
looked
at
the
transaction
as
whole
found
that
it
was
substantially
insurance.
and
concluded
that
it
was
insurance
contract
and
not
subject
to
federal
securities
laws.
when
this
court
reversed
it,
it
said
that
the
area
had
been
that
it
was
severable.
even
though
it
was
one
document,
it
was
--
part
of
it
was
a
security
subject
to
the
securities
laws.
the
other
part
of
it
was
insurance
properly
subject
to
the
state
insurance
regulatory
laws.
and
so
here
too,
you
have
housing.
we
are
not
contending
that
housing
is
subject
to
the
securities
laws
whatsoever.
but
in
order
to
obtain
the
housing,
one
must
buy
stock,
a
security,
which
has
certain
attributes.
we
think
that
that
stock
separately
ought
to
be
subject
to
the
federal
securities
laws.
finally,
i
would
note
that
the
dark
forebodings
of
the
future
which
had
been
uttered
here
as
to
what
would
happen
to
the
real
estate
industry
if
the
securities
law
were
to
apply
is
not
well
taken.
we
are
not
urging
that
all
multiple
housing
forms
be
subjected
to
securities
regulation.
on
the
contrary,
we
believe
that
our
position
here
is
a
modest
one.
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
enlarge
the
coverage
of
the
securities
laws.
we
are
asking
that
this
court
not
diminish
it.
thousands
of
persons
have
bought
stock
on
the
basis
of
economic
inducements
and
simply
put,
we
believe
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
protection
of
those
laws
that
apply
to
stock.
mr.
paul
gonson
thank
you.
mr.
paul
gonson
your
honor,
in
this
very
case
the
subscription
agreement
stated
that
it
was
offered
only
to
residents
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
paul
gonson
and
--
mr.
paul
gonson
there
would
have
been
of
course
some
danger
that
the
exemption
might
not
have
been
available.
but
the
statute
requires,
as
i
understand
it
your
honor
that
the
residents
be
actually
residents
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
suppose
when
we
talk
about
state
supported
housing
that
such
housing
is
going
to
be
constructed
essentially,
if
not
exclusively,
for
the
state's
own
residents.
and
so,
when
we
offer
the
possibility
in
our
brief
that
the
registration
requirements
of
the
securities
act
might
not
be
applicable,
i
think
that
it
is
a
reasonable
suggestion
to
make.
mr.
paul
gonson
that
is
correct
your
honor.
that
exemption
like
other
exemptions
are
strictly
construed.
now
we
offer
that
as
one
of
a
number
of
possibilities
to
indicate
that
there
may
be
ways
available
to
not
to
have
to
comply
with
registration
of
prospective
requirement
of
the
act.
mr.
paul
gonson
i
would
assume
so
if
the
residents
were
a
bona
fide
one
your
honor.
mr.
paul
gonson
i
would
assume
so.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
gonson
i
suppose
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
that
probably
is
so
with
respect
to
the
utilization
of
almost
any
exemption.
mr.
paul
gonson
that's
correct
your
honor.
we
refer
however
to
other
possible
exemptions
that
maybe
available.
and
may
i
note
that
even
if
no
exemption
were
available,
we're
not
talking
about
an
especially
onerous
burden.
we're
not
talking
about
guarantees
of
any
kind.
we're
merely
saying
that
then
what
would
be
required
is
that
information
would
have
to
be
filed
and
a
prospectus
would
have
to
be
given
to
prospective
purchasers.
and
in
a
project
of
this
massive
size,
we
submit
that
that
would
not
appear
to
be
on
this
phase
an
insurmountable
obstacle.
thank
you,
your
honor.
