mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
emphasize
at
the
outset
that
we
support
completely
the
position
of
the
petitioners
in
number
147
that
the
congress
did
not
contemplate,
including
within
the
purview
of
the
1933
and
1933
securities
acts,
shares
in
the
membership
of
a
publicly
aided
cooperative
housing
cooperation
whose
primary
objective
was
the
furnishing
of
housing
accommodations
to
persons
of
limited
income
who
were
prohibited
under
the
general
terms
of
the
statute
authorizing
the
construction
of
mitchell-lama
housing,
from
selling
those
shares
for
a
profit
or
for
the
expectation
of
a
profit.
i
shall
confine
my
argument
however
to
the
point
upon
which
the
state
and
the
state's
housing
finance
agency
obtain
certiorari.
that
neither
the
state
nor
the
state's
housing
finance
agency
are
subject
to
suit
in
the
federal
courts
for
the
relief
demanded
in
this
complaint.
now,
just
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
been
references
in
judge
rifkind's
argument
to
supervision
by
the
state.
supervision
the
state
has
been
through
the
state
commissioner
of
housing.
state
commission
of
housing
has
been
the
agency
of
the
state
that
supervised
the
construction
and
supervises
the
management
of
this
project.
the
state
financing
agency
is
an
agency
which
has
supplied
the
money
to
the
extent
of
the
92%
that
was
necessary
by
the
sale
of
bonds
to
the
public.
it
is
a
different
agency.
as
to
the
state
itself,
we
submit
that
its
claim
of
immunity
and
the
same
claim
would
be
applicable
to
the
state
commissioner
of
housing
if
that
state
agent
had
been
made
a
party
of
defendant
of
this
litigation,
and
the
state
commissioner
of
housing
has
never
been
sued
or
named
as
a
defendant
in
this
litigation.
we
submit
that
this
claim
of
immunity
from
suit
is
sustainable
and
should
have
been
sustained
under
this
court's
decisions
in
edelman
against
jordan
and
employees
against
the
missouri
public
health
department.
now
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
i
don't
think
you
need
to.
you
can
do
what
the
court
did
in
the
district
court.
it
did
not
reach
our
argument
because
it
was
not
necessary
to
do
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes,
your
honor.
we
have
a
backup
argument
as
so
far
as
the
state
is
concerned.
but
if
you
are
persuaded
by
judge
rifkind's
argument,
you
need
not
reach
our
portion
of
the
case
at
all.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
yes,
the
one
cause
of
action
directed
against
the
state
housing
finance
agency
is
so
posited.
but
the
difficulty
with
that
particular
complaint
is
directed
against
an
agency
which
is
purely
a
financing
agency.
an
agency
which
has
supplied
the
money
with
which
this
particular
project
was
built,
and
so
far
as
i
can
imagine,
i
don't
see
how
any
sort
of
reasonable
construction
could
lead
to
a
cause
of
action
against
an
agency,
and
this
is
something
that
goes
to
the
merits
and
because
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
case
as
against
this
agency.
no
possible
cause
of
action,
it
seems
to
me,
could
be
reasonably
predicated
against
the
state
agency
which
furnished
the
money
which
made
this
project
feasible.
these
plaintiffs
would
have
no
place
to
live
in
if
this
money
had
not
been
furnished
despite
the
increases
in
costs
that
occurred
that
compelled
the
furnishing
of
more
money
by
the
state
housing
finance
agency
than
to
have
been
contemplated
or
expected
in
the
first
instance.
that
applies
only
to
this
single
cause
of
action
against
the
agency.
now,
the
opinion
by
judge
rehnquist
in
the
edelman
case
came
down
on
a
period
that
was
just
shortly
after
the
briefs
had
been
submitted
in
this
case
by
counsel
before
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
edelman
opinion
was
not
noticed
at
all
in
the
opinion
by
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
and
we
feel
that
so
far
as
the
state
itself
is
concerned,
so
far
as
the
state
supervising
agency
is
concerned,
the
commissioner
of
housing,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
assuming
that
there
had
been
either
any
waiver
of
immunity
or
any
consent
by
the
action
of
the
state
in
sponsoring
this
project.
housing
was
a
field
in
which
the
state
of
new
york
was
intensely
interested
long
before
the
securities
and
exchange
act
was
passed.
actually
one
of
the
limited
dividend
projects
that
was
connected
in
some
way
with
this
same
sponsoring
agency,
the
amalgamated
houses
was
setup
on
1928,
people
were
actually
living
in
amalgamated
houses
in
1927,
christmas
of
1927.
there
is
not
here
the
fact
to
which
was
present
in
the
pardon
case.
the
state
going
to
a
proprietary
enterprise,
the
state
was
here
simply
as
a
regulator.
the
state
did
not
own.
these
people
did
not
contemplate
that
they
were
going
into
a
project
that
was
state
owned,
or
that
might
be
deemed
to
be
state
owned.
there
is
nothing
--
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
it
was
a
financial
backer
and
it
derived
no
financial
benefit
from
its
financial
backing.
it
provided
--
it
did
not
provide
any
money
except
to
people
who
were
limited
income
by
way
of
various
types
of
subsidies.
and
it
had
no
proprietary
interest
in
those
subsidies
at
furnished
housing,
at
furnished
benefit
in
the
nature
of
a
welfare
benefit.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
no
monetary
profit.
mr.
daniel
m.
cohen
social
profit,
yes
your
honor.
now
we
have,
i
think,
no
need
to
make
any
extended
argument
as
to
the
state's
immunity.
as
your
honor
has
indicated,
it's
not
necessary
to
reach
that
portion
of
the
case
if
you
agree
with
judge
rifkind's
argument.
and
i
think
that
i
can
save
the
time
of
the
court
by
resting
here
and
asking
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
reversed
and
that
the
complaint
in
this
action
be
dismissed.
