justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
part
of
the,
well
one
count
of
the
complaint
though
was
posited
not
on
securities
act
jurisdiction
but
on
section
1343,
wasn't
it,
which
was
derived
in
from
1983?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
mr.
nizer,
in
tcherepnin
that
didn't
accord
just
a
later
case
than
joiner.
the
court
does
talk
about
looking
at
substance
rather
than
form,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
the
language
i'm
thinking
of
is
this
language
on
page
336
where
they
say
“finally,
we
are
reminded
that
in
searching
for
the
meaning
and
scope
of
the
word
security
in
the
act,
form
should
be
disregarded
for
substance
and
the
emphasis
should
be
on
economic
reality.”
they
were
not
talking
of
the
full
definition
of
a
security.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
the
supreme
court
california
decision.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
from
this
court.
i
thought
you
said
it
was
decided
by
this
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
interpreting
of
state
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
had
be
sued
under
1983
as
well
as
under
the
securities
law
in
view
of
cases
like
monroe
against
pape
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
and
bruno
against
kenosha?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
i
would've
thought
that
1983
cost
of
action
would've
turned
on
the
definition
of
person
in
1983
rather
than
in
the
securities
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
frequently,
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
that
exemption
is
available
will
determine
--
will
turn
on
the
trial
of
the
issue
of
fact
of
the
residents
of
a
particular
offeree?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that's
why
hardly
anybody
uses
that
intrastate
offering
thing,
is
because
if
you
make
one
mistake,
you're
through.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
1933
act
too
that
expressly
confers
the
right
of
a
purchaser
to
sue,
isn't
it?
