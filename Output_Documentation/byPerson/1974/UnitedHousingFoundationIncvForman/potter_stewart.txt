what
were
the
criteria
for
approval
by
the
state
authorities
in
addition
to
the
income
levels
of
the
applicants?
justice
potter
stewart
by
regulation
or
statute?
justice
potter

mr.
cohen
if
we
should
decide
that
--
if
we
should
be
persuaded
by
judge
rifkind's
arguments,
would
we
get
to
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
and
really
if
judge
rifkind
is
correct,
there's
no
federal
jurisdiction,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
being
no
federal
jurisdiction,
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
falls
out
of
the
case,
because
after
all
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
jurisdictional
statute,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
having
to
do
with
federal
court
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
regulator
it
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
great
financial
backer
as
well,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
no
monetary
profit?
justice

just
social
profit.

the
stock
has
certain
attributes,
and
i
assume
we're
not
talking
about
livestock.
we're
talking
about
shares
in
the
corporation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
attributes
generally
are
the
possibility
of
dividends
if
the
corporation
has
profits.
they're
the
possibility
of
appreciation
or
depreciation
in
value
depending
upon
the
--
on
the
--
how
well
a
corporation
prospers.
and
they're
generally
with
exceptions
of
freely
alienable.
those
are
three
rarely
well-known
attributes
generally
of
shares
in
a
corporation,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well
your
point
was
stock
has
certain
attributes.
justice
potter
stewart
now
which
of
those
attributes
does
this
stock,
this
so-called
stock
have?
and
if
it
hasn't
any
of
those,
what
other
attributes
does
this
so-called
stock
has
that
stock
as
generally
understood
has?
the
stock
here
entitled
the
purchasers
to
an
interest
in
a
corporation
chartered
under
new
york
law.
it
gave
those
persons
a
right
to
vote
on
who
was
going
to
manage
their
corporation.
it
gave
those
persons
a
right
to
dividends
or
surplus
if
there
was
any.
justice
potter
stewart
ultimate
argument
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
how
about
whether
if
this
was
a
security,
you
would
still
--
you
could
still
be
making,
couldn't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
dividend
in
the
same
sense
that
a
dividend
on
a
life
insurance
policy
might
be
called
a
dividend,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
cost
turned
out
to
be
lower
than
