wait
just
a
minute.
will
you
amplify
on
that
before
you
proceed?
what
dividends?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
does
that
--
does
this
corporation
come
under
that
provision
of
that
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
either
one
of
the
courts
below
recognized
the
possibility
of
dividends
under
that
section
or
any
other
section?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
as
i
read
their
opinion
stated
that
there
were
expectations
on
income
in
three
ways.
and
none
of
the
three
involved
the
possibility
of
any
dividends.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
you
understand
that
those
dividends
would
be
paid
in
cash
or
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--
do
people
own
these
shares?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
the
rental
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
the
rental
were
to
be
used
in
that
way,
is
it
your
opinion
that
that's
income?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
we
were
talking
about
dividends
and
profits.
would
you
advice
anyone
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
to
pay
income
taxes
on
the
type
of
benefit
you're
talking
about?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gonson,
do
you
not
take
into
position
are
you
that
any
piece
of
paper
that
is
called
a
share
of
stock
is
necessarily
per
se
a
share
under
the
securities
act,
are
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
the
end,
you
look
to
the
economic
realities.
we're
on
agreement
on
that,
aren't
we?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gonson?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
section
of
your
brief
that
argues
that
this
type
of
housing
would
not
be
seriously
interfered
with
if
required
to
comply
with
the
securities
act.
the
first
suggestion
your
brief
makes
is
that
section
3
(a)
(11)
the
provision
for
intrastate
offerings
would
be
available.
do
you
suggest
seriously
that
offering
to
15,000
people
could
be
accomplished
under
3
(a)
(11)?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
correct.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
suppose,
there'd
been
a
single
offeree
who
was
not
a
resident
of
new
york,
what
would've
been
the
consequences?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there's
a
difference
between
the
people
who
buy
and
the
people
to
whom
a
security
is
offered.
and
the
3
(a)
(11)
exemption
relates
to
offeree
as
well
as
to
buyers,
and
if
you
make
one
mistake
in
an
offer
to
a
person
outside
of
the
state,
your
commission
will
require
a
rescission
offer.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
involves
a
large
new
york
cooperative
housing
project
known
as
co-op
city.
this
nonprofit
project
was
financed
and
constructed
under
a
new
york
law
designed
to
provide
low
cost
cooperative
housing
for
low
income
tenants.
the
project
was
heavily
subsidized
by
long
term
low
interest
mortgage
loans
and
tax
exemptions.
co-op
city
solicited
perspective
tenants
by
an
information
bulletin
which
described
the
project
and
included
estimates
of
construction
cost
and
monthly
rental
charges.
to
acquire
an
apartment,
a
perspective
tenant
had
to
buy
18
shares
of
stock
in
the
project
for
each
room
in
the
apartment
which
he
was
to
occupy.
construction
cost
greatly
exceeded
estimates
resulting
in
substantial
increases
in
the
rental
charges.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
suit
are
tenants
who
claimed
that
the
information
bulletin
contained
misstatements
of
fact.
the
defendants
are
the
various
parties
that
sponsored,
constructed,
and
now
operate
co-op
city.
the
suit
was
brought
in
a
federal
court
on
the
theory
that
the
sale
of
shares
was
subject
to
the
anti
provision
--
antifraud
provisions
of
the
federal
securities
acts.
the
sole
issue
in
the
case
before
us
is
whether
these
shares
constitute
securities
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
acts.
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
turns
on
this
question.
the
court
of
appeals
answered
the
question
in
the
affirmative.
we
take
a
different
view.
the
plaintiffs
were
not
investing
in
stock
with
the
view
to
making
a
profit.
they
were
acquiring
the
right
to
occupy
housing
on
exceptionally
favorable
terms.
these
shares
possessed
none
of
the
characteristics
of
instruments
commonly
known
as
securities.
accordingly,
we
conclude
that
they
are
not
within
the
purview
of
the
federal
securities
acts.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
white
have
joined.
