mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
brought
up
for
review
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
that
court
had
reversed
a
judgment
dismissing
the
complaint
filed
herein
for
want
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
the
respondents
in
this
case
who
are
the
plaintiffs
in
the
court
below,
are
a
number
of
residents
of
a
residential
development
called
co-op
city
located
in
the
borough
of
the
bronx
in
the
city
of
new
york.
these
respondents
purport
to
represent
a
class
to
wit
all
of
the
owners
of
apartments
in
co-op
city,
which
is
a
giant
development
and
contains
more
than
15,000
homes.
the
suit
was
generated
by
the
said
circumstance
to
which
we've
all
been
recently
exposed.
namely
that
there
was
an
escalation
in
the
cost
of
the
maintenance
of
the
apartments
which
the
defendants
had
--
respondents
had
acquired.
and
the
proffered
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
was
the
allegation
that
the
petitioners
had
violated
the
securities
laws
to
the
respondent's
detriment.
the
complaint
itself
consisted
i
believe
of
13
counts
of
which
ten
were
state
related
claims.
one
was
a
1933
act
violation
and
the
same
facts
were
alleged
as
a
1934
violation.
and
then
there
was
one
claim
against
the
state
and
the
state
agency
i
believe
under
the
civil
rights
law.
and
the
central
question
which
the
case
brings
up
for
review
is
this.
did
the
congress
in
the
securities
laws
intend
to
reach
the
transaction
which
underlies
this
case?
and
that
transaction,
i
shall
of
course
describe.
we
assert
the
negative
of
that
question.
in
other
words,
that
congress
had
no
such
intention.
and
our
argument
will
rest
on
three
pedestals
and
i
believe
that
each
of
them
would
support
the
conclusion
we
are
here
to
contend.
first
that
this
transaction
related
to
homes
not
to
securities
and
not
to
investments.
secondly
that
this
is
a
transaction
to
which
commercial
considerations
and
profit
possibilities
are
roughly
alien
and
therefore
not
within
the
realm
of
congressional
concern
at
all.
and
lastly,
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
state
created
welfare
plan
in
which
the
state
selected
and
conferred
upon
a
group
of
its
beneficiaries,
a
group
of
its
citizens,
various
benefits.
and
as
far
as
i
can
read
the
history
of
congressional
intention,
i
find
that
congress
has
indicated
no
interest
in
penetrating
this
field.
we
start
therefore
in
narrating
our
story
with
the
state
of
new
york.
acting
through
its
legislature,
the
state
of
new
york
became
concerned
with
the
plight
of
the
city.
this
was
in
the
early
60s,
the
flight
of
the
urban
middle
class,
the
blight
of
the
inner
city
slum,
the
decay
of
the
housing
inventory
in
the
big
cities,
the
high
cost
of
replacement
of
dwellings
making
safe
and
clean
dwellings
unattainable
by
wage
earners
and
other
people
of
low
modest
income.
certainly,
an
area
of
governmental
concern
which
i
am
sure
this
court
has
heard
of
many
times.
and
the
state
determined
to
make
a
massive
contribution
towards
the
alleviation
of
the
conditions
i
have
described.
its
concern,
the
state's
concern,
was
with
homes
and
dwelling
places
for
its
residents
and
citizens.
not
securities
and
not
investment
opportunities.
new
york
passed
a
law
called
the
mitchell-lama
law,
which
contained
various
provisions
for
variety
of
possibilities,
but
with
respect
to
the
subject
that
we're
concerned
with,
i
will
say
that
it
created
first
a
regulatory
agency
which
has
applied
into
co-op
city
has
provided
a
system
of
supervision
and
regulation
vastly
more
pervasive
than
any
system
of
regulation
that
we
are
familiar
with
say
in
the
utility
field
or
the
banking
field
or
the
airplane
field
or
any
of
the
normal
objects
of
regulation.
and
i
believe
i
state
correctly
that
my
learned
adversaries
agree
with
me
that
this
was
a
very
pervasive
system
of
control.
and
of
course
there
was
a
very
good
reason
for
it.
the
state
was
going
to
provide
massive
benefits
to
those
who
are
going
to
be
the
beneficiaries
of
this
law.
it
provided
the
means
for
the
obtaining
of
the
money
necessary,
or
the
bulk
of
the
money
necessary
for
the
creation
of
this
new
housing
which
it
contemplated.
the
state
was
offering
to
the
prospective
members
of
co-op
city
whom
it
selected
the
following
benefits
among
others.
first,
savings
regularized
from
the
availability
of
construction
and
acquisition
costs
at
very
low
cost,
because
the
state
agency
could
raise
that
money
by
tax
exempt
obligations
of
the
agency.
i
need
hardly
say
that
that
represents
an
enormous
fraction
of
the
cost
of
housing,
the
cost
of
the
money
used
in
construction.
then
there
were
savings
conferred
upon
the
members
of
this
cooperative
by
the
reduction
or
abatement
of
real
estate
taxes
to
the
extent
of
80%
thereof,
again,
a
very
enormous
benefit
in
the
maintenance
of
these
properties.
and
then,
with
the
collaboration
of
a
philanthropic
foundation
called
the
united
housing
foundation,
which
i
shall
describe
later,
savings
became
possible
in
co-op
city
by
the
elimination
of
the
promoters'
profit,
the
entrepreneurs'
profit,
the
builders'
profit
and
the
managers'
profit.
all
of
those
were
eliminated.
and
then
the
cost
overall
was
spread
over
a
period
of
40
years,
thus
making
the
annual
burden
a
very
modest
one
indeed
plus
other
benefits
that
i
mentioned
some
of
which,
i
mentioned
in
my
brief,
but
are
relatively
smaller
in
proportion.
it
was
all
of
these
together
that
made
it
possible
to
do
what
seems
like
a
miracle
today
to
be
able
to
sell
apartments
at
the
price
of
$450.00
per
room,
a
four-room
apartment
for
$1,800.00.
anyone
who
has
purchased
a
cooperative
apartment
knows
that
that
is
one
of
the
miracles
of
the
age.
now,
as
i
have
said,
co-op
city
was
sponsored
by
the
united
housing
foundation.
this
foundation
is
composed
of
a
group
of
labor
unions
well
known
for
their
progressive
policies,
like
the
amalgamated
clothing
workers,
the
international
ladies
garment
workers
union
whose
record
of
performance
of
this
area
is
well-known.
housing
cooperatives,
civic
leaders
all
volunteers
who
furnished
to
this
project
the
sense
of
community
involvement
who
furnished
it
the
enriching
advice
of
knowledgeable,
distinguished
and
dedicated
citizen
and
whose
standing
in
the
community
was
such
that
they
were
able
to
had
a
little
lubrication
to
the
wheels
of
the
bureaucracy.
and
perhaps
more
important
than
any
of
these
to
ensure
the
generating
idea,
the
idealism
behind
this
entire
project,
namely
the
ideal
of
a
community
of
home
owning
neighbors
democratically
managed,
nondiscriminatory
in
style
endowed
with
the
humane
amenities
in
the
artistic
and
spiritual
fields
of
community
of
homes
and
a
community
of
homes.
now
this
was
not
the
first
experience
of
the
united
housing
foundation
in
this
field.
it
had
a
long
record
of
success
in
promoting
and
creating
housing
projects
similarly
endowed
with
this
spiritual
concept.
and
on
my
brief,
i
cite
quite
a
number
of
famous
ones
that
are
extent
in
the
city
of
new
york.
and
so
it
was
that
a
city
housing
something
like
50,000
people
was
built
on
what
a
previously
been
a
playground
in
the
northern
part
of
the
bronx.
and
it
took
a
very
considerable
period
to
do
it,
from
1964
to
1972.
and
during
that
period,
i
need
hardly
say
that
costs
were
climbing.
every
other
index
of
our
economy
showed
a
similar
climb
in
the
sense
of
inflationary
costs.
ultimately
the
project
cost
$422
million
considerably
in
excess
of
the
original
estimates.
and
of
these
$420
million,
the
state
agency
furnished
92.26%,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
again
that
not
only
did
the
law
specify
the
classes
of
members
who
might
live
in
this
cooperative,
namely
the
applicants
have
to
show
that
their
earnings
were
not
in
excess
of
six
times
the
estimated
maintenance
charges.
but
the
very
individuals
who
are
accepted
for
membership
in
this
coop
have
to
be
approved
by
the
state
authorities,
certainly
not
an
aspect
which
is
normally
found
in
the
sale
of
investment
securities
or
speculations.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
there
were
benefits
conferred
upon
the
aged,
upon
veterans,
upon
the
disabled
and
things
of
that
kind.
those
were
given
preference.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
by
the
practices
of
the
regulatory
agency
and
under
its
regulations.
now,
i
come
to
a
central
feature
of
this
entire
transaction.
there
was
one
concept
that
was
excluded
from
every
phase
of
this
enterprise,
the
concept
of
commercialism
and
the
corollary
concept
of
profit.
this
applied
at
all
stages
of
the
transaction
and
not
only
to
the
one
which
is
most
directly
relevant
to
the
question
before
this
court.
for
instance,
members
of
co-op
city
could
receive
no
dividends.
now
i
know
that
my
learned
friend
says
that
they
could
under
a
section
of
the
law.
he
misreads
the
law.
that
section
deals
with
rental
properties
by
private
builders
but
who
have
the
right
to
have
limited
profit
returns,
not
to
co-op
city.
the
court
below
said
that
there
might
be
a
rebate
on
the
rental
if
the
cost
of
maintenance
was
less
than
was
estimated.
that
is
true
since
the
cost
of
maintenance
in
a
cooperative
is
shared
by
all
the
members
of
the
cooperative,
and
is
based
on
an
estimate
if
at
the
end
it
turned
out
that
the
estimate
was
excessive,
the
excess
is
turned
back
to
those
who
have
provided
it.
i
don't
call
that
a
dividend.
they
could
sell
the
homes
that
they
had
acquired
but
for
no
more
than
the
cost
at
which
they
paid
for
it,
$450
a
room,
not
a
dollar
more
could
they
get
for
their
homes
no
matter
how
much
land
values
or
building
values
may
have
escalated
in
the
city
of
new
york.
and
not
only
that,
they
have
to
sell
their
homes
if
they
move
from
the
premises.
it
was
only
a
home
for
their
personal
residences
and
that
of
their
surviving
spouse.
but
if
for
any
reason
they
wanted
to
move
out
of
the
co-op
city,
they
had
to
offer
their
apartments,
their
homes
for
sale
to
the
corporation
--
to
the
coop
corporation
or
to
a
qualified
new
buyer
at
the
price
at
which
they
bought.
not
only
were
they
not
promised
any
profits,
in
the
literature
which
announced
this
project,
they
were
told
in
words
loud
and
clear
that
there
could
not
be
any.
now
i
move
up
the
scale
away
from
the
cooperators
upward.
the
united
housing
foundation,
which
was
the
sponsor
of
the
project
was
formed
under
a
statute
in
new
york
called
the
not
for
profit
corporation
law.
it
could
make
no
profit
because
under
the
statute
of
its
creation,
it
was
forbidden
to
do
so.
the
construction
was
done
by
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
united
housing
foundation.
and
while
that
was
organized
as
an
ordinary
corporation,
since
its
stockholders
could
make
no
profit,
namely
the
united
housing
foundation,
there
would
be
no
point
in
the
subsidiary
earning
any
profits.
the
subscribers
were
not
offered
tax
deduction
as
an
inducement
in
the
sense
that
tax
shelters
are
marketed
around
the
street
as
this
court
well
knows,
where
tax
shelters
are
offered
as
a
form
of
investment.
that
was
not
the
approach
here
because
there
were
no
such
possibilities,
except
for
the
modest
tax
deduction
which
is
available
to
every
homeowner
on
the
interest
of
his
mortgage
and
on
the
taxes
which
he
contributes
to
the
--
to
his
community.
they
were
not
offered
any
significant
outside
income.
that
is
this
was
not
a
project
where
in
addition
to
homes,
there
was
a
vast
shopping
center
attached
to
it
from
which
the
people
could
hope
to
derive
substantial
speculative
profits,
because
had
that
happened
the
law
would
not
have
permitted
this
project
to
be
financed
under
the
statute
at
which
i
have
referred.
all
they
were
offered
and
all
that
these
people
received
was
the
opportunity
to
own
a
home,
and
that
only
so
long
as
they
lived
in
it.
and
if
they
have
to
part
with
it,
they
could
enjoy
no
form
of
capital
appreciation.
now
membership
in
this
cooperation
was
memorialized
in
two
instruments,
two
writings.
one,
an
occupancy
agreement,
so-called
but
actually
reads
very
much
like
an
ordinary
lease.
and
secondly,
an
instrument
which
was
called
a
share
of
stock,
but
differing
in
many
ways
from
the
conventional
one
especially
in
the
very
fact
that
it
could
not
be
sold,
could
not
be
authenticated,
couldn't
be
transferred,
couldn't
be
given
away
and
with
which
you
have
would
to
part
once
you
cease
being
the
occupant
of
the
apartment
which
you
had
bought.
now
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
have
very
meticulously
expressed
their
avoidance
of
entertaining
any
opinion
on
the
underlying
merits
of
the
controversy
between
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendants
or
between
the
petitioners
and
respondents.
i
have
observed
that
my
good
learned
friends
have
extensively
argued
the
merits
of
the
case
in
their
briefs,
but
i
shall
not
do
so.
i
shall
rely
on
the
proposition
that
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
this
controversy
belongs
in
a
federal
forum
under
the
securities
laws,
or
whether
it
belongs
in
the
state
forum
under
laws
adequate
for
that
purpose
in
the
state
of
new
york.
the
district
judge
made
this
comment.
“it
is
well
to
know
that
the
outset
of
this
inquiry
that
it
is
the
fundamental
nonprofit
nature
of
this
transaction
which
in
this
court's
view,
is
the
insurmountable
barrier
to
plaintiffs
claim
in
the
federal
court.”
and
we
agree
with
that
expression
and
hope
to
win
favor
for
it.
our
claim
is
a
very
narrow
one
actually.
our
central
point
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
bring
within
the
ambit
of
the
securities
laws
an
enterprise
devoted
to
the
purchase
of
homes
a
state
dominated
enterprise
with
philanthropic
and
community
participation
to
which
the
notion
of
profit
is
utterly
foreign.
a
project
pursued
without
the
profit
motive
promoted
without
profit
inducement
and
shared
by
its
beneficiaries
without
the
any
expectation
of
gain,
and
the
history,
the
legislative
history
suggests
to
me
that
that
is
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
because
the
evils
against
which
these
securities
laws
were
written
are
still
sufficiently
vivid
so
that
most
of
us
can
remember
them
from
actual
experience.
predatory
financial
practices
in
the
securities
markets,
stock
market
price
manipulation,
luring
of
small
investors
by
false
promises
of
easy
wealth.
in
short,
i
submit
that
the
realm
of
congressional
concern
was
the
speculation
and
investment
realm
and
its
identifying
flag
was
the
promise
or
expectation
of
profit,
and
one
cannot
read
in
my
opinion
the
legislative
history
of
either
the
1933
or
the
1934
act
without
coming
to
that
conclusion.
the
district
court
read
that
history
accurately
when
it
concluded
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
sweep
into
the
ambit
of
the
federal
securities
laws.
state
encouraged
nonprofit
transactions
made
pursuant
to
a
state
emergency
housing
law,
all
three
elements
that
i've
mentioned
available
only
to
state
residents.
now,
in
reaching
a
contrary
conclusion,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
and
i
should
like
to
identify
its
errors
into
three
categories.
first,
it
was,
i
will
finish
this
sentence.
it
was
moved
by
a
literal
application.
it
misread
this
court's
illumination
of
the
meaning
of
investment
contract,
and
i
believe
it
misread
the
securities
guidelines.
i'll
stop
at
this
moment
and
if
i
have
some
time
later
i
will
answer
in
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court.
my
learned
friend,
mr.
nizer,
opened
by
an
impressive
set
of
figures
which
were
designed
i
think
to
impress
with
their
size.
he
spoke
of
the
large
number
of
shares,
the
large
number
of
residents
and
the
large
amount
of
money.
but
i
take
it
that
questions
of
jurisdiction
are
not
measured
by
that
kind
of
a
yardstick
and
the
same
principles
would
be
applied
if
this
was
a
two
20-room
house
only
in
new
york
and
was
financed
by
a
very
much
smaller
transaction.
so
i
think
we
can
disregard
this
jury
appeal
and
address
ourselves
to
the
question
as
to
whether
we're
talking
about
a
security.
of
course
my
learned
friend
keeps
on
saying
that
they
bought
stock.
and
i
kept
on
saying
that
they
bought
homes.
and
the
economic
reality
which
the
case
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
referred
to,
compels
us
to
listen
to
is
what
was
the
business
transaction
that
this
homeowner
--
home
buyer
was
interested
in.
say
because
it's
called
a
share
of
stock?
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
referred
to
livestock,
it's
also
stock,
and
not
all
trees
are
trees.
if
some
are
whiffletrees
and
some
are
hat
trees.
the
mere
fact
that
you
hang
a
label
on
it
of
stock
because
this
is
the
conventional
mechanism
by
which
the
general
public
has
approached
this
way,
doesn't
necessarily
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
it's
stock.
i'm
not
suggesting
for
a
minute
that
when
you
call
something
stock,
you
shouldn't
examine
whether
it
isn't
stock.
and
of
course
you
start
out
by
saying
“he
called
it
stock,
maybe
it
is.”
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
every
security
--
every
stock
is
a
security.
the
statute
says
every
stock
is
a
security
unless
the
context
otherwise
directs.
and
the
context
takes
us
back
to
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
to
the
legislative
object.
and
the
legislative
object
under
the
securities
laws
was
to
control
the
marketplace's
securities,
the
marketplace
and
investments,
the
marketplace
in
speculations
in
that
kind
of
money
making
enterprises,
and
not
in
a
social
welfare
scheme
of
the
kind
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
nizer
referred
to
the
cash
contribution
of
7%
which
the
subscribers
here
furnished.
well,
it
is
in
the
aggregate
a
very
large
amount
of
money.
but
the
comparison
that
i
would
make
would
be
more
to
the
fact
that
a
medicare
participant,
an
age
group
to
which
i
now
belong,
pays
a
small
percentage
of
his
medical
bill
when
he
goes
to
the
hospital.
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
is
not
a
social
welfare
program
that
we're
talking
about.
on
the
question
of
rescindability
which
was
mentioned,
i
should
say
that
every
contract
here
was
rescindable.
thousands
of
them
were
rescinded
and
even
the
plaintiff
below,
mr.
milton
forman
rescinded
their
contracts
recently
when
they
moved
out
of
the
apartment
and
got
their
money
back.
on
one
question
i
must
take
issue
with
my
learned
friend
and
that
is
on
the
definition
of
person
as
given
in
the
securities
act.
the
1934
act
does
not
define
the
state
as
a
person.
the
1934
act
as
i
read
it
says
the
term
person
means
an
individual,
a
corporation,
a
partnership
and
association,
a
joint
stock
company,
a
business
dress
or
an
incorporated
organization.
so
it
can't
be
the
1934
act
in
which
the
fraud
statute
appears.
it's
the
1933
act
which
deals
with
registration
which
includes
a
government
or
political
subdivision
thereof.
but
nobody
claims
that
we
should
have
registered
at
this
case.
we
didn't
of
course
and
nobody
claims
we
should
have.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
that
may
well
be.
now,
on
the
question
of
dividends,
no
cooperative
pays
dividends.
essentially,
a
cooperative
is
ten
couples
going
to
the
theatre
together
and
contributing
$25.00
a
piece.
if
when
they
return
from
the
theatre,
there's
$10.00
left
in
the
kitty,
they
pay
it
back
to
the
subscribers.
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
theatre
party
declared
a
dividend
in
a
business
venture
for
which
the
people
invested
their
$25.00.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
even
that
might
be
more
of
a
dividend
than
the
actuality.
of
course
there
at
least
it's
derived
from
the
earnings
of
the
insurance
company.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
cost
turned
out
to
be
less.
now,
this
court
of
appeals
must've
been
troubled
by
this
very
question.
if
it
weren't
troubled
by
the
question
as
to
whether
this
was
really
security,
they
wouldn't
have
reached
out,
for
what
i
must
most
respectfully
say
the
trivia
which
they
identified
as
the
profit
features
of
this
transaction.
just
look
at
them.
they
said
that
there
was
a
reduced
carrying
charges
resulting
from
the
rentals
received
out
of
commercial
spaces.
now
i
think
this
court
ought
to
know
what
we're
talking
about.
in
this
community
of
15,000
home
and
15,000
people,
there
had
to
some
grocers.
incidentally,
this
is
quite
remote
from
the
center
of
town.
there
had
to
be
some
butchers.
there
had
to
be
some
barbers.
there
had
to
be
some
people
who
are
rendering
that
kind
of
normal
neighborhood
service.
and
naturally,
you
have
to
make
space
available
for
them
and
some
income
was
generated
that
way.
does
that
make
this
a
shopping
center
investment?
it's
to
me
comparable
if
the
management
of
this
cooperative
had
said
“we're
going
to
charge
every
householder
for
his
bathwater.”
that
would
generate
some
money.
but
that
then
would
make
the
housing
cooperative
a
business
venture
in
the
sense
of
earning
dividends.
the
second
thing
they
said
was
that
these
securities
were
tax
--
that
these
homeowners
enjoy
tax
deductibility
for
their
share
of
the
interest
and
the
mortgage
and
their
share
of
the
taxes
that
they
paid
to
the
city.
and
of
course
that
is
true.
as
this
court
well
knows,
every
homeowner
is
entitled
to
that
deduction.
every
owner
of
a
cooperative
apartment
is
entitled
of
that
deduction.
every
owner
of
a
condominium
apartment
is
entitled
to
that
deduction.
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
securities
business
at
all,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
investment
aspects
of
this
thing
at
all.
it
is
an
aspect
of
homeownership,
not
of
security
ownership.
and
moreover,
it
doesn't
depend
upon
the
efforts
of
others.
it
depends
upon
the
taxpayer's
personal
status.
if
he
has
no
reportable
income,
this
tax
deduction
doesn't
do
him
any
good.
it's
only
if
he
has
some
income
against
which
he
can
take
this
deduction
that
he
confers
any
benefit
upon
it.
and
the
third
item
that
really
was
reaching,
they
said
“well,
this
is
a
bargain.
it's
going
to
cost
them
less
to
live.”
that's
the
benefit
that
the
state
conferred
upon
him.
that's
like
saying
the
medicare
is
a
profitable
enterprise.
this
just
doesn't
add
up
to
my
--
in
my
way
of
thinking
of
it.
of
course
there
were
cooperative
ownership
means
that
the
people
run
the
property
don't
make
a
profit
so
you
don't
have
to
pay
that
profit
to
the
man
who
runs
it.
it
also
imposes
some
obligations.
it
means
you
got
to
see
that
the
snow
is
shoveled,
and
so
on.
but
to
call
this
bargain
an
aspect
of
a
profit
aspect
of
this
enterprise
goes
beyond
what
i
think
is
rational
elucidation
of
the
statute.
now
as
far
as
the
fcc
is
concerned,
i
can
say
very
little.
their
brief
was
only
delivered
to
me,
all
within
--
the
final
brief
i
didn't
get
till
yesterday
i
think.
and
we've
put
in
a
typewritten
answer
which
we
will
furnish
--
printed
brief
on.
i
am
baffled
by
the
position
of
the
fcc
because
until
recently,
they
certainly
wanted
to
keep
hands
off
the
sale
of
cooperatives
and
the
sale
of
condominiums
and
all
this
business
and
they
wrote
rules
which
excluded
them,
and
wrote
no
action
letters
which
excluded
them,
and
wrote
guidelines
in
the
release
which
is
in
the
record,
in
which
all
the
identifying
marks
that
attributed
to
this
project
exclude
them
from
the
field
of
security
regulation.
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
if
they
changed
their
mind
--
mr.
simon
h.
rifkind
--
all
i
can
say
is
they've
appeared
on
the
scene
very,
very
late.
indeed,
they
were
not
in
the
district
court.
they
were
not
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
didn't
get
here
until
a
couple
of
days
ago.
i
think
i've
taken
all
the
time
i
should.
thank
you.
