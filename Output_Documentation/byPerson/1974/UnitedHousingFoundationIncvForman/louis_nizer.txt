mr.
louis
nizer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sole
securities
issue
on
this
appeal
is
whether
1,312,128
shares
of
common
stock
publicly
offered
by
wide
distribution
through
the
mails
to
15,372
separate
purchasers
for
more
than
$32,800,000.00
in
cash
paid
by
these
purchasers
constitutes
securities
under
the
federal
laws.
of
the
thousands
of
decisions
involving
alleged
frauds
in
the
sale
of
stock
which
have
been
rendered
by
the
federal
courts
during
the
past
40
years,
there
is
not
a
single
case
which
supports
the
defendant's
contention
that
common
stock
does
not
come
under
the
protection
of
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
securities
laws.
the
reason
that
the
defendants
cannot
cite
a
single
case
in
which
common
stock
was
held
not
to
be
a
security
is
that
this
court
as
far
back
as
1943
settled
this
issue
in
the
joiner
case.
it
mandated
that
the
specific
term
“stock
as
a
matter
of
law
is
a
security”.
and
it
also
held
that
were
as
here,
the
case
involved
“a
share
of
stock”
the
plaintiff
need
only
offer
“the
document
itself”
to
prove
that
it
is
a
security
and
thereby
establish
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
securities
act.
now
the
defendants
concede
here
that
the
common
stock
is
so
designated
par
value
$25.00
a
share
that
appears
at
the
uh
brief,
page
11.
but
they
urge
that
these
shares
denominated
as
common
stock
are
something
different
than
what
they
are
represented
to
be.
and
even
this,
in
the
joiner
case,
this
court
disposed
of
such
convoluted
reasoning.
this
court
held
that
in
the
enforcement
of
the
securities
laws,
offerings
“will
be
judged
as
being
what
they
were
represented
to
be.”
mr.
louis
nizer
sure,
and
i
will
discuss
that
in
full
your
honor,
in
a
moment.
but
there,
they
were
talking
of
an
investment
contract.
that's
the
second
string
to
our
bow.
when
it
is
stock,
you
don't
have
to
go
to
the
question
of
whether
it
constitutes
an
investment
contract
without
being
a
stock.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
and
i
think
that
the
economic
reality
is
here
as
i
shall
soon
develop
clearly
indicate
that
this
is
a
stock
transaction,
on
its
face
and
on
the
economic
realities.
i
do
not
agree
with
the
learned
counsel
that
this
is
distinguished
from
other
cases.
we
have
had
cases
that
this
court
has
decided.
in
the
sobieski
case
for
example
that
a
membership
in
a
club
is
sufficient
in
--
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
mr.
louis
nizer
no
i
said
that
the
sobieski
case,
i
was
mistaken
in
referring
it
to
this
court.
in
the
california
ninth
circuit,
there
is
the
case
state
court
by
judge
treanor,
i
believe
of
the
state
court.
mr.
louis
nizer
that's
right.
but
i
think
if
i,
since
i
have
limited
time,
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
economic
realities
here.
i
think
that
will
be
better
addressed
here
on
this
question.
the
court
below
has
been
chastised
by
the
defendants
for
being
literal,
because
it
followed
the
instruction
of
this
court
in
joiner
case
and
the
statute
fortunately
is
explicit
and
lucent.
and
in
this
admirable
sense,
it
is
literal.
stock
is
a
security
and
so
it
is.
to
cavil
with
such
legislative
clarity
is
unwittingly
or
otherwise
to
distort
the
statute's
true
meaning
in
order
to
avoid
its
clear
application
to
this
case.
now
24
years
later,
this
court
reexamined
and
reaffirmed
the
joiner
case,
and
that
was
of
course
in
the
tcherepnin
case
that
your
honor
referred
to,
which
provides
a
rare
instance
of
a
case
remarkably
similar
in
fact
to
our
case,
and
at
which
the
court
rejected
the
same
contentions
as
the
defendants
make
here.
in
tcherepnin,
the
plaintiffs
bought
shares
in
a
savings
or
loan
association.
and
the
defendants
there
contended
that
the
shares
purchased
were
not
stock
because
looking
at
the
realities.
one,
they
were
not
publicly
traded
as
here.
they
didn't
fluctuate
in
value.
they
redeemed
a
bullet
par
only.
that
the
shares
represented
memberships
rather
than
investment
and
i
notice
to
this
constant
use
of
the
word
membership
here,
that
the
shares
like
many
customary
attributes
such
as
preemptive
rights,
right
to
inspect
the
books,
although
we
have
that
right
in
our
case.
and
there
were
restrictions
on
the
signability.
those
all
the
same
issues.
and
these
arguments
were
held
by
this
unanimous
court
to
be
irrelevant
to
the
question
whether
federal
security
laws
were
applicable.
and
this
court
held
that
the
shares
in
that
case
were
includable
in
the
statue
to
stock
because
there
was
a
stock
certificate,
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
there,
also
the
possibility
of
surplus,
which
is
of
course
the
dividend.
even
though,
mind
you,
in
that
case
as
your
honors
will
recall,
it
was
brought
in
the
receivership.
the
defendant
was
neither
receiver
yet
they
talked
of
the
potential
of
surplus,
which
was
sufficient,
the
very
possibility
of
it.
now
clearly
in
our
case
these
elements
exist.
above
all,
this
court
in
tcherepnin
pronounced
the
policy
consideration
and
philosophy
of
these
statutes
which
provides
special
insight,
we
submit,
and
a
large
view
of
the
present
case.
there,
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
protect
particularly
the
many
small
investors.
i
think
there
was
a
quotation
that
they
repeated
from
joiner;
“remedial
legislation
should
be
construed
broadly
to
effectuate
its
purpose.
the
reach
of
the
act
does
not
stop
with
the
obvious
common
place”.
in
our
case,
the
plaintiffs
were
eligible
to
buy
the
stock
which
would
give
them
a
four-room
apartment
with
a
monthly
carrying
charge
of
$23.2
as
represented
in
the
prospectus.
if
they
earned
more
than
$6,600.00,
they
were
ineligible,
$6,600.00
a
year.
so
that
the
class
that
purchased
the
stock
and
put
up
$32.8
million
in
this
case
were
the
same
type
of
small
investors
as
in
the
tcherepnin
case,
indeed
much
more.
so,
obviously,
people
living
on
pensions,
old
people,
welfare
and
so
on.
and
yet
without
these
people
who
collectively
put
up
over
$32
million
in
cash,
there
could
be
no
co-op
city,
because
the
mitchell-lama
act
mandated
that
the
venture
or
risk
capital
have
to
come
from
the
public,
unlike
the
other
housing
acts
that
section
21,
after
private
housing
financed
law.
the
jurisdictional
facts
demonstrating
that
this
stock
transaction
was
within
the
security
statutes
are
spelled
out
in
the
complaint.
first
we
have
a
prospectus
called
an
information
bulletin
which
was
widely
distributed
through
the
mail.
that's
paragraph
50.
and
this
bulletin
has
a
heading,
appears
at
178
a
of
the
record
which
reads
as
follows;
“stock
and
other
equity
obligations
offer.”
and
there
follows,
“the
housing
company”
--
that's
the
river
bay
corporation
who's
stock
we
bought
--
“invites
offers
for
shares
of
its
capital
stock
that
all
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
the
subscription
agreement.”
and
that's
at
178
a
of
the
record.
now
the
subscription
agreement
which
was
attached
to
the
prospectus
and
was
intended
to
be
torn
out
and
returned
with
a
check
for
part
payment
of
the
stock
read,
at
104
a
“i
hereby
subscribe
to
so
many
shares
of
class
b
capital
stock”
and
the
par
value
is
$25.00
a
share.
i
may
say
now
in
answer
to
a
contention
made
here.
all
of
the
money,
all
of
the
$432
million
instead
of
$289
million
as
was
represented
in
the
prospectus
upon
which
these
poor
people
put
up
their
savings,
all
of
that
money
had
to
be
provided
by
the
public.
the
only
thing
the
state
did,
this
is
not
like
the
subsidized
housing
at
all.
all
that
the
state
gave
was
the
advantage
of
a
low
interest
mortgage
valuable
indeed,
which
had
to
be
paid
off
in
full
with
interest
in
the
40
years,
and
all
that
the
state
did
otherwise
was
the
tax,
the
city
gave,
a
tax
rebate
which
is
done
for
other
housing
projects
even
commercial
projects.
but
the
100%
of
the
money
to
construct
this
profit
--
this
enormous
structure
for
60,000
people,
had
to
be
paid
by
these
60,000
people
and
they
weren't
eligible
even
to
own
the
stock
unless
they
are
into
only
$6,600.00
a
year.
and
the
plain
practical
situation
when
friend
talks
of
profits
and
all
these
general
commercial
propositions,
the
plain
fact
is
that
through
fraudulent
representations,
which
appear
in
allegations
of
the
complaint.
i'm
not
discussing
the
merits.
i'm
showing
that
there
is
a
proper
complaint
here
under
the
statute.
in
their
representations
they
said
that
the
cost
above
$289
million
to
construct
this
would
be
born
by
the
contractor,
which
is
the
csi.
and
he
would
take
any
excess.
that
was
the
basis
on
which
these
people
put
up
their
money.
and
yet
when
inflation
came,
and
the
cost
went
up,
by
fraudulent
ignoring
of
the
direct
representation
that
the
contractor
would
bear
that
cost,
if
there
was
an
inflation
not
maintenance
increase
that
we
have
to
pay
that
kind
of
inflation
or
operation,
but
construction.
they
increase
to
$30
million
one
year,
$40
million
another
year
and
loaded
it
on
to
these
people
who
had
taken
it
on
the
representation
that
not
one
cent
of
that
money
would
be
paid
by
them
but
would
be
paid
by
the
contractor.
and
why
was
this
possible?
because
the
contractor,
the
csi
and
the
uhf,
this
fine
organization
and
incidentally
we
have
not
joined
these
defendants,
the
heads
of
these
unions
and
so
on,
they
were
tinker
heads.
we've
sued
the
operating
company.
they
had
interlocking
directors
precisely
the
same
directors
and
officers
as
the
contractor
was
in
the
uhf
and
even
our
river
bay
company.
the
company
whose
stock
these
people
bought
had
the
same
directors
and
officers,
so
that
this
was
an
interlocking
situation
and
which
even
the
commissioner,
the
state
commissioner,
waived
a
requirement
of
bonds
for
the
construction
of
this
property.
and
he
waived
the
liquidity
requirement.
a
liquidity
requirement
in
the
contract
which
said
that
the
contractor
must
have
$13
million
liquidity,
and
he
waives
that
and
the
contractor
has
$100,000.00
liquidity.
so
that
it
seems
to
us
that
not
only
have
we
a
clear
stock
transaction
sold
in
the
market
to
these
people
but
that
the
--
all
the
elements
of
a
fraud
action
exist
here
under
the
statutes,
and
it
was
intended
that
the
people
who
built
that
kind
of
structure
should
not
be
immune
anymore
than
the
man
who
invest
for
large
profits
as
they
call
it
galactic
profits
in
wall
street.
i
don't
see
why
this
statute
which
is
remedial
should
be
limited
to
the
large
investor.
legitimate
though
he
be,
why
should
it
not
apply
to
these
people
who
put
up
their
life's
earnings
and
probably
made
the
only
investment
they
ever
made
in
stock
through
their
lives.
the
river
bay
company,
our
company
was,
as
the
complaint
says
“the
captive
of
the
contractor
and
the
sponsor”
and
$81
million
was
loaded
on
to
the
river
bay
stockholders
improperly.
and
there
is
a
claim
since
i
will
not
have
a
chance
to
rebut
again,
that
there
was
notice
of
this.
we
deny
the
notice.
the
notice
didn't
say
--
didn't
even
refer
to
all
these
increases.
said
there
will
be
an
increase.
but
as
your
honors
know,
you
cannot
waive
under
the
securities
act
that
provisions
and
protections
of
the
act,
even
if
they'd
given
us
notice,
it
would
be
ineffectual.
now
it
is
sufficient
for
affirmance
that
in
this
case
we
have
this
widely
distributed
shares
of
par
value
common
stock
bought
for
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
and
represented
to
be
stock
in
a
prospectus
and
the
subscription
agreement.
clearly,
this
alone
warrants
application
of
the
of
the
federal
securities
law
and
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts.
there
are
two
additional
grounds
for
affirmance.
the
shares
are
also
an
investment
contract.
they
qualify
as
such
clearly.
and
that
they
are
an
instrument
commonly
known
as
security,
another
definition
of
the
securities
act.
in
view
of
the
argument
to
be
made
by
counsel
for
the
scc
and
the
time
elements,
i
shall
leave
these
two
alternative
grounds
to
our
brief
at
pages
48
to
60.
and
i
turn
to
the
eleventh
amendment
question
because
i
think
i'd
like
to
deal
with
that.
with
respect
to
the
eleventh
amendment
issue,
only
the
state
of
new
york
is
involved.
the
agency
is
not
involved
and
clearly
may
be
sued
into
federal
court
for
two
reasons.
it
is
a
separate
legal
entity
and
it
is
not
a
division
or
department
of
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
i
think
it
can
be.
mr.
louis
nizer
an
agency
is
a
person
and
under
the
interpretation
that
the
--
this
court
has
given
to
the
securities
act,
a
definition
of
person
includes
state,
governmental
agency
of
any
kind.
mr.
louis
nizer
well,
it's
a
person
under
a
civil
rights
act
as
a
i
suppose
the
other
aspect
of
the
question.
but
under
the
securities
act
we
also
have
a
definition
which
defines
person
as
any
state
which
is
to
me
one
of
the
reasons
why
there
is
an
authority
to
sue
here,
and
the
waiver
does
take
effect.
the
fact
that
the
--
there
is
a
separate
legal
entity
in
the
agency
is
not
--
is
conceded
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
his
opinion
number
56,
which
we've
cited.
but
second
and
determinative
is
the
fact
that
any
judgment
against
the
agency
is
not
enforceable
against
the
state.
they
are
two
separate
entities
and
there
is
no
link
of
liability
by
statutes
or
otherwise
for
each
others
obligation.
indeed,
your
honors,
there's
a
specific
disclaimer
of
liability
in
section
46,
subdivision
8
of
the
private
housing
finance
law.
and
the
bonds
of
the
agency
are
not
the
debt
of
the
state.
therefore,
like
any
other
corporation,
the
agency
is
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction.
now
with
respect
to
the
state,
it
has
waived
its
immunity
in
two
ways.
first,
by
special
statute
quoted
at
page
67
of
our
brief,
the
white
document.
it's
section
325
of
the
private
housing
finance
law,
and
by
its
--
secondly
and
by
its
conduct
in
this
very
case.
now
first
as
to
the
statute,
you've
been
told
that
the
statute
waives
immunity
only
in
the
suit
in
the
state
court.
there's
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
which
would
justify
any
such
limitation
however
strict
the
construction.
on
the
contrary,
the
statute
reads
that
the
state
“may
be
sued
in
the
same
manner
as
a
private
person.”
surely
a
private
person
can
be
sued
in
a
federal
court.
indeed,
a
private
person
cannot
be
sued
in
the
state
court
of
claims.
furthermore,
there
is
a
conclusive
indicator
in
the
language
of
the
waiver
that
it
was
not
intended
to
limit
jurisdiction
in
the
state
court.
that
language
refers
to
the
scope
of
the
waiver.
it
reads
“with
regard
to
liabilities
arising
out
of
the
mitchell-lama
act,
the
state
may
be
sued
in
the
same
manner
as
a
private
person.”
now
what
term
could
be
more
generic
and
all
inclusive
than
the
word
liabilities?
case
law
set
which
we
set
forth
in
page
68
of
our
brief,
demonstrates
that
the
unqualified
use
of
the
word
liabilities
encompasses
federal
as
well
as
state
claims.
and
the
supervisory
duties
of
the
state
through
the
commissioner
with
respect
to
cooperative
housing
are
all
pervasive.
the
commissioner's
charged
with
responsibility
to
see
that
river
bay
complies
with
“the
law”.
that's
section
321.
so
river
bay
stocks
sold
in
violation
of
the
anti-fraud
provisions
of
the
security
law
certainly
brings
into
definition
what
do
we
mean
by
compliance
with
law,
and
that
has
been
interpreted
even
by
the
new
york
courts,
the
laws
of
the
land.
the
second
sentence
of
the
waiver
which
prohibits
the
recovery
of
costs
has
been
raised
in
the
brief,
though
not
argued
orally,
prohibits
recovery
of
costs
against
the
state
does
not
alter
the
right
to
sue
in
the
federal
court.
it
merely
means
that
the
plaintiff
can
not
recover
cost
because
he
has
accepted
the
condition
of
the
waiver.
now
in
its
reply
brief,
the
state
cites
five
cases
all
dealing
with
refunds
of
state
taxes
and
these
cases
are
not
applicable
to
our
case,
because
there
the
statute
set
forth
are
comprehensive
scheme
involving
procedures
before
state
administrative
agencies.
the
final
step
of
which
was
judicial
review
of
the
state
agencies
determination
in
the
state
court.
furthermore,
all
that
was
involved
there
in
these
five
cases
were
state
tax
law,
not
as
here
federally
created
right.
i
stress
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
diversity
of
citizenship.
we
belong
here
under
the
right
of
the
statute.
in
addition
to
statutory
waiver,
there
is
the
state's
conduct.
this
court
set
forth
a
test
composed
of
two
elements
to
determine
when
the
state's
conduct
constitutes
a
waiver,
the
edelman
case.
and
incidentally
that
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
came
down
late
but
was
argued
there
and
the
court
rejected
it
as
i
think
this
court
should.
did
congress
intend
the
federal
statute
to
apply
to
the
states?
test
one.
did
the
state
by
its
conduct,
voluntarily
enter
into
a
federally
regulated
area?
test
two.
now
as
to
congress'
intention
to
include
states,
the
evidence
is
undeniable.
the
securities
act
of
1933,
section
2
(1)
says
it
includes
“governments
and
their
subdivisions,
and
the
house
and
senate
reports”
which
we
cite
voluminously
at
pages
71
to
73
of
our
brief,
state
emphatically
and
repeatedly
that
“person
includes
states”.
and
incidentally,
the
1933
and
1934
acts
has
been
held
in
tcherepnin
not
to
be
read
in
pari
materia
and
therefore
wouldn't
matter
which
that
statute
we
took
which
year.
and
at
the
same
time
that
the
statute
included
states,
it
provided
in
section
27
of
the
1934
act
for
exclusive,
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
now
how
significant
that
combination
of
provision
is
to
reject
any
argument
by
the
state
of
new
york.
thus
congress
notified
the
states
that
if
the
states
chose
to
engage
in
the
interstate
sale
of
securities,
the
price
for
it
was
waiver
of
immunity.
having
shown
that
congress
has
intention
to
include
states,
i
now
turn
to
whether
the
state
of
new
york
chose
to
engage
in
the
sale
of
securities.
this
is
not,
as
has
been
stated
in
the
brief
and
orally,
a
matter
of
regulation.
we
admit
that's
a
straw
man
in
these
briefs.
we
admit
that
states
regulation
is
not
--
doesn't
subject
it
to
the
federal
jurisdiction.
here
we
have
the
state
participating
pervasively
in
every
fact.
indeed,
under
the
mitchell-lama
act,
not
a
shovel
of
earth
could
have
been
turned
until
public
put
up
this
$32
million.
in
other
words,
the
state
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
not
only
supervisors,
no
regulation
merely,
it
organized
the
entire
construction
in
every
way.
also,
the
state
of
new
york
in
1955
passed
the
mitchell-lama
act,
and
this
was
20
years
after
the
security
act,
so
that
the
state
with
full
knowledge
that
it
was
in
the
realm
of
federal
regulation
went
ahead.
and
the
mitchell-lama
act
itself
represents
the
decision
by
the
state
to
furnish
housing
by
obtaining
venture
or
risk
capital
from
the
public
through
sale
of
co-op
stock.
to
be
brief,
and
in
conclusion
since
my
time
is
running
out,
the
state
under
the
statute
is
the
major
participant
in
planning
the
project,
raising
the
venture
capital
from
the
public,
construction
and
operation.
the
project
for
which
it
received
the
fee
from
the
plaintiffs
of
$3,510,000.00
obviously
no
mere
filing
fee
under
the
blue
sky
laws.
and
no
other
state
has
a
statute
of
waiver
of
immunity
similar
to
section
325.
i
say
this
because
i
don't
think
we're
enlarging,
there
have
been
alarms
caused
in
this
brief
that
this
will
cause
interference
with
state
issue,
and
so
financing
nothing
of
the
kind,
neither
--
on
neither
side
of
the
issue
is
there
an
extension
here.
we
are
asking
that
the
court
not
delimit
the
rights
that
have
always
existed
in
this
case.
even
as
to
new
york,
this
would
be
extremely
limited,
because
this
waiver
only
applies
in
the
mitchell-lama
law,
not
many
other
provisions
of
the
state.
so
we're
dealing
here
with
an
exceedingly
restricted
area.
but
the
rights
of
these
plaintiffs
ought
to
be
tested.
we
have
waited
three
years,
your
honors,
to
get
a
trial
in
this
case.
why
we
have
been
banded
around
through
the
courts
on
this
alleged
jurisdictional
question.
i
think
it's
time
that
these
people
had
a
day
in
court.
