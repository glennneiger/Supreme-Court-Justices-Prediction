you
preferred

you
went
from
the
agency
to
the

of
appeals?
justice
william

the
statutory
language,
any
interested

doesn't

mr.
ayres,
take
a
look
at
63
(a)
if
you
have
it
there
of
the
government's
petition
which
sets
forth
that
some
of
the
statutory
language,
and
--
i
can't
keep
all
these
sections
straight,
but
was
subparagraph
capital
b
that
begins
about
the
middle
of
63
(a),
“any
determination
made
person
to
this
paragraph
shall
be
subject
to
judicial
review
by
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
circuit
which
include
state
upon
filing
in
such
court
within
30
days
of
such
decision
of
a
petition
by
any
interested
person.”
now
do
you
--
does
that
govern
this
particular
action
that
it's
here
before
us
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
section
then
that
authorizes
review
of
this
administrator's
action
which
you
sought
to
have
a
review
in
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
know
where
it
is
in
the
government's
brief
or
your
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh!
don't
worry
about
it,
at
least
for
now.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
involves
a
construction
of
the
clean
air
act
and
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
fifth
circuit.
the
clean
air
act
requires
that
each
state
adopt
the
plan
for
attaining
and
maintaining
national
standards
for
the
quality
of
air
within
its
borders.
the
state
plan
details
the
limitations
on
air
population
with
which
particular
sources
within
the
state
must
comply.
the
present
case
has
required
us
to
determine
the
conditions
under
which
the
clean
air
act
permits
sources
of
population
to
obtain
variances
from
the
population
limitations
which
are
imposed
on
them
by
a
state
plan.
for
reasons
set
out
at
length
in
the
opinion,
we
concluded
that
variances
may
be
granted
under
section
110
(a)
(3)
of
the
act
which
governs
revisions
of
state
plans
if
the
plan
nonetheless
concludes
to
provide
for
the
attainment
and
maintenance
of
national
air
quality
standard.
this
was
the
adoption
of
the
regulation
originally
promulgated
by
the
epa,
the
fifth
circuit
set
it
aside.
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong
in
doing
so
and
we
reverse
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
noted
his
dissent.
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
