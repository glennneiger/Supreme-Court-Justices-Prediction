mr.
richard
e.
ayres
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
richard
ayres
and
i
represent
the
respondents
here.
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
the
language
of
the
clean
air
amendments
of
1970,
a
statute
which
was
passed
to
expand
markedly
the
government's
program
to
control
air
pollution.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
act
requires
individual
sources
of
pollution
who
seek
more
time
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
state
plans,
to
seek
a
federal
postponement,
and
when
if
ever,
they
may
approach
state
governments
for
state
law
variances.
in
other
words,
the
question
is
when
does
the
federal
procedure
preempt
the
state
law
procedures?
we
believe
the
statutes
clear
on
its
face
the
federal
preemption
occurs
as
of
the
time
certain
and
the
time
certain
is
the
date
that
the
state
plans
where
approved.
epa
on
the
other
hand
has
argued
that
preemption
occurs
or
has
triggered
only
by
its
own
judgment
that
there
would
be
a
violation
of
air
quality
standards.
now,
i
think
it's
important
at
the
outset
to
understand
why
petitioners
or
respondents
before
the
court
here
object
to
the
epa
proposal.
what
epa
proposes
to
do
whenever
a
source
comes
forward
asking
for
additional
time
to
meet
a
compliance
schedule
is
to
go
through
an
entire
analysis
of
the
impact
of
that
source
on
the
air
quality,
that
is
the
air
generally
at
ground
level,
as
it
would
be
affected
by
that
variance.
in
practice,
the
way
this
is
done
is
by
feeding
data
concerning
the
given
source
into
a
computer
model
which
is
a
very
complex
set
of
assumptions
essentially
mathematical
form
about
what
will
happen
here
under
certain
conditions.
cracking
this
through
the
model,
and
then
coming
to
a
prediction
on
the
basis
of
the
model
of
what
the
impact
would
be
on
air
quality.
in
most
cases,
it's
just
that,
a
prediction.
now,
that
prediction
is
subject
to
a
great
deal
of
error
as
you
might
imagine
and
epa
had
said
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief
that
it
may
be
subject
to
error
of
as
much
as
a
100%.
at
the
same
time,
it
also
means
that
there
is
fruitful
ground
for
objection
to
any
conclusion
epa
draws
on
the
part
of
any
source.
the
source
may
come
forward
with
its
own
data
from
monitors
and
say
the
prediction
was
wrong
or
it
may
come
forward
and
say
it's
the
wrong
model
or
the
wrong
factor
was
put
into
it,
whatever
these
possibilities
are.
there's
a
fruitful
opportunity
there
for
dispute
over
whether
or
not
the
air
quality
standards
would
be
violated.
the
second
reason
why
this
approach
seems
to
us
is
one
that
should
not
and
was
not
chosen
by
congress
is
because
it
violates
the
fundamental
scheme
of
the
act.
the
act
is
built
on
the
premise
that
the
state
plan
begins
with
an
evaluation
of
air
quality
throughout
the
state.
state
does
that
on
an
aggregate
basis
on
the
basis
of
monitors
throughout
the
state.
second
stage
is
that
the
state
then
determines
how
much
reduction
is
necessary
in
the
emissions;
that
is
the
pollution
coming
out
the
stacks,
in
order
to
meet
those
air
quality
standards,
again,
a
general
judgment
for
the
state
as
a
whole.
it
then
applies
to
each
individual
polluter,
a
formula
to
require
reductions
and
emissions
from
that
individual,
and
essentially
as
you
can
see,
the
ideas
to
spread
the
burden
of
reducing
pollution
across
sources
all
over
the
state.
now,
if
you
go
about
looking
at
each
individual
polluters
affect
on
air
quality
when
it
comes
into
request
a
variance,
you
are
then
reexamining
these
general
decisions,
but
on
the
individual
basis,
and
the
result
will
be
if
you
hand
out
a
lot
of
variances,
you
will
end
up
with
a
very
unequal
burden
being
placed
on
the
polluters.
those
who
have
not
received
variances
will
be
left
with
complying
and
they
don't
have
to
pay
the
cost
to
that.
those
who
received
variances
because
they've
been
able
to
convince
epa
that
they
won't
violate
ambient
air
quality
standards
will
be
left
with
no
requirement
to
reduce
emissions.
the
result
we
think
would
be
fundamentally
unfair.
now,
that
--
these
i
think
are
the
reasons
why
congress
chose
in
the
first
place
to
require
any
individual
change,
any
change
in
an
individual
compliance
schedule
or
any
other
requirement
of
the
state
plan,
with
respect
to
an
individual
source
to
go
through
the
postponement
procedure
and
not
to
be
judge
on
the
basis
of
its
effect
on
air
quality.
that
was
too
iffy
a
judgment
and
it
was
too
unfair
to
go
about
it
that
way.
i
think
we
shown
in
our
brief
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
totally
an
unambiguous.
it
states
that
any
source
that
seeks
a
change
in
any
requirement
that
applies
to
it
must
go
through
the
postponement
procedure.
in
fact,
the
importance
of
this
--
of
going
through
this
procedure,
the
importance
of
the
strictness
in
the
procedure
is
demonstrated
over
and
over
in
the
legislative
history.
as
you
may
notice
in
reading
in
the
appendix,
congress
originally
consider
requiring
sources
to
go
to
a
federal
district
court
to
obtain
this
kind
of
postponement.
ultimately,
they
left
to
an
administrative
adjudicative
hearing
as
in
the
final
act.
but
this
does
reemphasize
the
importance
in
congress
mind
of
this
procedure
as
a
way
to
prevent
easy
escape
from
the
requirements
of
state
plans.
now,
epa
has
put
forth
an
alternative
interpretation,
which
is
that
somehow
through
the
revision
authority
of
the
law,
it
has
the
authority
to
allow
states
to
grant
variances
rather
than
having
sources
go
through
this
procedure.
we've
canvassed
this
issue
rather
thoroughly
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
can
be
summed
up
in
a
rather
simply
way.
revisions
clearly
are
and
i
think
it's
clear
on
the
statute,
something
which
is
set
up
to
allow
general
changes
in
the
state
plan.
if
a
state
for
example
should
determine
that
it
had
required
stiffer
requirements,
then,
it
really
needs
to
meet
the
ambient
air
quality
standards.
it
would
be
free
to
go
to
epa
in
a
general
way
and
ask
for
general
change
in
its
plan.
but
the
burdens
of
that
change
would
have
to
be
distributed
equally.
it
can't
go
to
epa
and
ask
for
individual
changes,
which
would
unequally
distribute
the
burdens
of
meeting
the
national
ambient
air
quality
standards
the
primary
purpose
of
the
revision
authority,
i
think
it's
clear
in
the
statute,
was
to
allow
for
situations
where
changes
had
been
made
or
could
be
made
that
will
allow
for
earlier
compliance
rather
than
later
compliance.
but
in
any
case,
the
revision
authority
is
something
which
is
to
be
used
to
make
general
changes
in
the
state
plan,
not
changes
applicable
to
a
specific
sources;
the
distinction
we
think
is
very
clear.
now,
this
distinction
has
also
been
agreed
to
by
five
court
of
appeals;
they
reviewed
the
issue.
all
five
of
those
courts
who
appeal
rejected
epa's
claim
that
it
had
authority
under
the
revision
authority
to
allow
specific
sources
of
pollution
to
have
more
time.
four
of
those
five
courts
of
appeals
agreed
with
us
that
the
trigger
after
which
the
postponement
procedure
became
applicable
was
a
date
certain,
not
a
judgment
about
air
quality.
the
fifth
circuit
chose
what
we
think
is
the
correct
interpretation
that
the
dates
certain
was
the
date
of
approval
of
the
state
plan,
which
of
course
was
in
1972
in
those
cases.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no,
that's
always
been
our
position,
unless
you're
referring
to
the
statement
before
congress
that
i
made.
in
which
case,
all
i
can
say
is
that
was
a
statement
made
in
the
context
of
a
general
attack
on
the
state
variance
laws.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
we
believe
that
its
time
that
those
were
too
lax
and
was
also
made
in
the
context
when
we
really
had
and
looked
at
the
law
closely.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
that's
right.
three
others
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
four
others
have
not.
the
three
courts,
the
first,
second
and
eighth
circuits
agreed
with
us
as
to
the
concept,
that
is
it's
a
date
certain
that
triggers
the
postponement
procedure,
not
an
air
quality
judgment.
but
they
chose
to
set
that
date
as
the
date
of
the
attainment
date
specified
in
the
state
plan
for
meeting
air
quality
standards.
this
is
confusing.
i
think
the
crucial
figure
to
notice
is
that
it's
the
date
set
for
attainment,
it's
not
a
question
of
whether
an
individual
source
will
affect
attainment;
that's
the
government's
position.
the
other
three
courts
said,
it's
a
date
certain.
it's
a
date
certain
that
the
state
chose
to
attain
the
national
standard,
which
in
most
cases
is
mid-1975,
although
there
are
some
cases
where
later
dates
were
chosen
through
another
procedure
which
is
not
at
issue
before
the
court
here.
i
think
it's
important
also
to
look
at
the
suggestion
epa
has
made
that
strict
construction
of
110
(f)
as
it's
written
would
be
burdensome
because
i
think
that's
a
false
argument.
110
(f)
does
not
always
require
a
hearing,
110
(f)
requires
an
opportunity
for
hearing,
requires
that
there'd
be
findings
in
a
adjudicative
proceeding,
and
that
those
findings
relate
to
the
availability
of
technology,
the
uses
of
available
alternative
measures
in
order
to
reduce
the
effects
of
the
continued
pollution
during
the
interim
period.
and
the
judgment
about
whether
the
source
is
sufficiently
valuable
so
that
it's
continued
pollution
at
those
levels
is
cognizable.
epa
has
in
effect
admitted
that
this
is
not
a
terribly
burdensome
procedure
by
promulgating
the
september
26
regulations.
those
regulations
required
that
in
the
post-attainment
period,
the
only
means
for
attaining
more
--
for
obtaining
more
time
is
through
the
federal
postponement
procedure.
and
obviously,
if
that
procedure
was
burdensome
as
the
agency
has
made
out
before
this
court,
it
would
not
been
willing
to
publish
those
regulations.
in
fact,
the
scheme
that
epa
proposes,
the
revision
authority
is
more
burdensome.
it
involves
the
states
making
an
original
judgment
upon
the
requested
variance.
a
judgment
which
includes
additional
factors
besides
the
once
that
are
included
under
110
(f)
such
as
the
question
of
the
effect
on
air
quality
which
is
a
difficult
inexpensive
determination
to
make.
these
proposed
variances
then
go
to
epa,
which
goes
over
the
same
set
of
information,
comes
to
another
judgment
on
air
quality
as
well
as
other
issues.
and
if
it
disagrees
with
the
state
and
decides
that
the
air
quality
impact
would
result
in
a
violation
of
ambient
air
quality
standards,
since
the
proposed
variance
back
to
the
state
where
the
state
begins
at
that
point
through
the
postponement
procedure,
this
in
our
view
is
a
recipe
for
delay.
it's
much
more
burdensome
than
the
110
(f)
procedure,
which
is
a
single
procedure
with
a
smaller
number
of
issues
to
deal
with.
in
our
view
basically,
the
difference
between
the
two
schemes
with
respect
to
burden
is
that
the
revision
procedure
suggested
by
epa
shift
some
of
the
burden
to
the
states.
that
maybe
an
epa's
bureaucratic
self-interest,
but
it's
not
necessarily
in
the
public
interest.
and
finally,
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
epa's
statements
about
the
burden
of
this
110
(f)
procedure
ignore
the
whole
purpose
of
the
110
(f)
procedure
of
making
it
a
stringent
procedure,
which
was
to
discourage
sources
from
seeking
additional
time
rather
than
compliance.
and
if
the
110
(f)
procedure
works
as
it
was
intended,
there
will
be
fewer
requests
than
there
will
be
if
the
--
if
you
use
the
revision
procedure.
in
that
case,
the
burden
on
the
agency
will
of
anything
be
reduced.
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
epa
has
brought
this
case
before
the
court
because
essentially
when
error
that
was
made
in
1972
by
the
agency.
when
the
states
first
adopted
their
plans,
epa
consented
to
a
confusion
in
some
state
laws
between
what
a
compliance
schedule
was
and
what
a
variance
was.
compliance
schedule
being
a
schedule
set
at
the
time
emission
limitations
where
adopted,
which
gave
the
source
time
to
comply
with
those
emission
limitations,
as
oppose
to
a
variance
which
adds
more
time
on
the
end.
as
a
result,
epa
now
has
several
thousand
in
the
fifth
circuit
state
law
variances
which
are
in
effect
compliance
schedules
under
federal
law.
now,
this
obviously
creates
a
burden
if
you
continue
to
operate
on
the
premise
that
this
will
continue
to
be
dealt
with
these
variances.
in
our
view,
we
have
no
interest
or
desire
in
forcing
the
agency
to
go
back
through
a
whole
process
which
amounts
to
essentially
changing
the
name
of
what
was
called
the
state
variance
and
calling
it
something
else.
the
court
stayed
the
order
of
the
fifth
circuit
knowing
at
that
time
that
it
would
result
in
epa's
approving
several
thousand
variances
in
the
fifth
circuit.
those
variances
are
approved
and
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
fifth
circuit
refuse,
denied
a
request
for
stay
and
of
course
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes.
the
stay
request
was
made
here
and
it
was
granted.
and
during
that
period,
epa
promulgated
approval
of
these
several
thousand
variances.
now
as
to
those
variances,
we're
perfectly
happy
to
leave
them
where
they
are.
we
believe
that
in
effect
they
are
compliance
schedules
and
it
seems
to
add
nothing
to
go
back
and
to
try
to
reclassify
those.
in
fact,
the
fifth
circuit's
order
was
not
one
that
would
require
retrospective
application.
the
fifth
circuit
ordered
epa
to
disapprove
the
state
of
georgia's
variance
statute,
and
it
said
nothing
about
retrospective
application,
talk
in
terms
of
future
application.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
so,
we
think
that
although
we
suggest
that
one
alternative
for
how
to
deal
with
these
variances
are
brief,
perhaps
an
equally
go
to
a
better
alternative
is
simply
to
make
to
affirm
the
lower
court's
ruling
which
would
have
prospective
effect
and
leave
the
variances
as
they
were
called
before
in
place.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
for
the
future,
we
would
have
the
agency
under
order
to
not
to
approve
any
such
state
variance
and
to
order
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
yes
such
a
procedure
would
go
through
the
postponement
procedure
that
disapproval
of
the
state
variance
law
would
leave
only
the
procedural
postponement
to
go
through.
with
respect
to
those
future
request
for
more
time,
epa
september
26
regulation's
disapprove
the
state
variance
statutes.
so,
one
stage
of
what
we
believe
was
the
proper
interpretation
of
fifth
circuit's
decision
and
what
this
court
should
uphold
is
already
taken
place.
epa
has
disapproved
all
the
state
variance
statutes.
epa
also
proposed
a
replacement
federal
regulation.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
epa
--
well,
they
disapprove
all
state
variance
statutes
in
compliance
with
the
first,
second,
fifth
and
eighth.
they
then
proposed
an
alternative
federal
regulation
to
replace
those,
which
wasn't
compliance
with
the
first
circuit.
now,
we
believe
that
proposed
regulation
should
have
been
one
that
was
in
compliance
with
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
agency
would
of
course
be
free
in
compliance
with
the
ruling
from
this
court
to
promulgate
a
regulation
that
properly
implement
the
fifth
circuit
rather
than
the
first
circuit
rule.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
pardon
me?
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
is
it
before
the
court?
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
this
is
the
case
which
went
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals
rather
than
to
the
district
court.
so,
there
was
only
a
notice
petition
for
review.
that
is
i
believe
in
the
appendix,
is
that
right?
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
think
it's
in
there.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes.
the
statute
requires
that
the
--
that
review
of
the
administrator's
action
and
approving
a
plan
will
go
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes.
it's
noted
on
page
1
of
the
appendix
as
petition
filed
for
review.
it's
a
docket
entry,
june
30
of
1972.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
believe
they
are.
the
government
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
we
will
check
now.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
we
don't
think
there's
any
question
of
it.
it
was
briefed
before
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes,
and
the
court
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
it
does
mention,
and
so
--
and
since
that
is
question
that
goes
to
jurisdiction,
it
must
be
presumed
to
decide
in
our
favor,
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no,
it's
not
mentioned
in
the
briefs
here.
that's
right.
it's
not
an
issue
between
the
parties
and
never
has
been
accepted
in
that
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
the
injury
in
fact,
your
honors,
that
the
petitioners
here
are
a
national
organization
with
members
in
georgia,
georgia
organization,
and
two,
georgia
resident.
so,
the
injury
in
fact
involved
is
the
effect
on
their
health
of
breathing
continued
polluted
air
which
we
believe
would
result
from
the
failure
of
the
state
plan
to
reach
the
intended
goal
of
meeting
the
national
air
quality
standards
on
time.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes.
on
the
cover
of
the
respondent's
brief,
you
will
see
the
listing
of
the
parties.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
those
are
--
they
are
both
residents
of
georgia,
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
it's
a
georgia
non-profit
organization.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
they
live
in
areas
where
abatement
actions
had
been
undertaken.
i
don't
know
for
sure
whether
they
live
in
that
area
where
sources
sought
a
variance.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
don't
believe
it
does,
no.
the
organizational
plaintiffs
are
petitioners,
i
think
both
cases
sue
on
behalf
of
their
members
which
obviously
is
one
of
the
crucial
test,
is
that
they're
be
members
involved
in
those
areas
would
be
affected
by
the
action
in
both
cases,
the
organizational
petitioners
below
do
have
members
there
who
would
be
affected
by
continued
pollution
in
those
areas.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
believe
it
does,
yes.
the
issue
as
i
say
was
briefed
before
the
fifth
circuit
court,
and
the
statement
was
filed
in
the
court
as
to
the
standing
possessed
by
the
various
parties.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
approximately,
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
it
was
not
raised
in
the
briefs
some
--
in
chief
on
the
case.
it
was
raised
by
the
government
at
oral
argument
and
the
court
asked
for
supplementary
briefing
on
issues.
so,
the
briefs
was
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
on
both
sides.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes,
it
was.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
the
statute
--
the
section
suit
undergoes
to
the
proper
court,
that
is
to
say,
it
says
of
suit
to
review
the
administrator's
action
and
approving
specific
state
implementation
plan
shall
be
filed
in
the
appropriate
circuit.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
there
is
a
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
there's
a
separate
--
it
would,
it
says
it's
a
petition
for
review
of
the
administrator's
action
and
approving
or
promulgating
a
plan,
may
be
filed
only
in
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
appropriate
circuit.
there's
a
separate
section
which
provides
for
citizens
in
certain
circumstances
which
states
that
any
person
may
bring
suit
and
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
in
the
legislative
history
of
this
section
that
the
intent
was
quite
the
same
in
both
sections.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes,
within
the
constitutional
limits,
one
must
presume.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
certainly.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
we
do.
we'll
be
please
to
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
we
addressed
both
the
issue
of
the
attributes
in
the
parties
and
the
requirements
of
the
statute
and
the
general
requirements
this
court
has
enunciated
with
respect
to
standing
in
general.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
petition
is
a
notice
petition
in
compliance
with
the
usual
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no,
it
doesn't
allege
anything
about
standing.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
i
think
there
are
two
ways
of
answering
that.
one
is
that
the
court
below
did
consider
information.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
one
is
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
for
one
is
that
--
in
the
documents
submitted
and
along
with
the
briefing
of
this
issue
since
the
issue
wasn't
raised
in
the
briefs
in
chief.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes,
there
are
affidavits
in
there.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
there's
a
difficult
--
i
think
they
are,
but
there's
a
difficult
problem
here
and
that
this
case
arose
before
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
before
a
court
that
was
really
equipped
to
take
evidence.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
well,
i
think
there's
no
question
that
there
is
a
case
of
controversy.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
presume
it
would
if
their
comes
members
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
presume
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
the
ninth
circuit
--
that
decision
with
respect
to
standing
is
still
on
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
they
did
held
--
they
did
hold
that,
that's
right.
we
believe
that
decision
was
wrong
under
your
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
we
held
that
an
organization
could
only
sue
if
the
organization
was
injured
in
a
way
identical
without
of
the
members,
and
we
believe
that
is
wrong
under
a
long
line
of
your
cases,
and
that's
why
we
sought
petition
for
rehearing.
it
would
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i
think
there's
not.
i
think
if
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
i
think
the
statute
was
intended
to
provide
broad
citizen
participation.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
that's
right,
their
parties
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
independently
on
their
own.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
that's
right.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
no.
this
has
to
do
with
review
of
the
administrator's
action
in
granting
a
postponement.
i
take
it
has
only
to
do
without.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
that
is
section
307
of
the
act,
which
is
section
1857h-5.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is.
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
cited
i
believe
in
--
mr.
richard
e.
ayres
this
--
the
issue
of
that
section
is
briefed
in
the
briefing
that
was
done
the
court
below
in
standing,
so
it
would
be
clear
from
that
i
think.
well,
to
summarize
very
quickly
that
the
--
we
feel
the
issue
before
the
court
is
one
which
involves
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
is
very
clear,
unambiguous
on
its
face,
and
this
court
should
in
line
with
its
traditional
function,
interpret
that
statute
as
it
reads
and
that
the
agency
should.
it
believes
this
interpretation
of
the
laws
that's
written
is
incorrect.
take
that
controversy
to
a
forum
which
can
consider
in
full
which
would
be
in
this
case
the
congress.
thank
you
very
much.
