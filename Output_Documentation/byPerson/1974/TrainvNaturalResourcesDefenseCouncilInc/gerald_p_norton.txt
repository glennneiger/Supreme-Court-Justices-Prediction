mr.
gerald
p.
norton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
to
review
the
judgment
of
that
court,
reversing
the
environmental
protection
agency's
approval
of
a
implementation
plans
submitted
by
the
state
of
georgia
pursuant
to
the
clean
air
act.
the
case
is
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
petition
for
review,
direct
review
pursuant
to
that
act
filed
by
natural
resources
defense
council
(nrdc)
and
others.
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
approval
on
several
grounds,
only
one
of
which
is
before
the
court
today.
that
ruling
concerns
the
substantive
standards
and
the
procedural
requirements
governing
epa's
consideration
of
a
variance
from
a
requirement
of
a
state
implementation
plan.
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
nrdc's
argument
that
all
variances
regardless
of
circumstances
must
be
treated
as
involving
postponements
plan
requirements,
and
therefore
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
110
(f)
of
the
act.
epa
disagrees
and
has
from
the
outset,
construed
the
act
as
authorizing
it
to
approve
variances
in
at
least
some
circumstances
without
reference
to
section
110
(f).
epa's
position
has
been
upheld
by
the
other
four
court
of
appeals
to
consider
the
question.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right.
the
--
both
the
circumstances
and
the
distinctions,
the
differences
that
follow
from
these
two
approaches
because
they
are
substantial.
the
case
arises
under
the
1970
amendments
to
the
act
which
substantially
revert
the
act
and
established
a
very
wide-ranging,
complex,
and
innovative
program
to
try
to
deal
with
air
pollution,
and
imposed
on
newly
graded
epa
in
the
states
a
variety
of
new
duties
to
be
satisfied
within
a
fairly
unusual
system
of
statutory
deadlines.
before
discussing
the
particular
facts
concerning
the
georgia
plan,
i
think
it
would
be
useful
if
i
review
the
statutory
provisions
involved
here
and
with
some
care.
the
case
is
principally
concerned
with
the
program
under
the
act
to
try
to
deal,
control
and
reduced
air
pollution
resulting
from
emissions
from
existing
stationary
sources.
i'm
not
dealing
with
motor
vehicles
or
other
matters.
section
109
of
the
act
required
that
epa
promulgate
what
are
called
national
air
quality
standards
for
certain
pollutants.
the
so-called
primary
standards
under
the
act
which
are
the
ones
of
pertinence
today
where
to
be
set
by
epa
at
a
level
requisite
to
protect
the
public
health
within
adequate
margin
of
safety.
i'll
refer
to
these
as
the
national
standards.
these
standards
had
to
be
issued
by
epa
after
rulemaking
proceedings
within
120
days
from
enactment
of
the
act
in
december
1970.
they're
subject
to
judicial
review
and
are
also
subject
to
revision
by
epa,
but
the
same
time,
section
107
of
the
act
required
epa
within
90
days
of
enactment
to
consult
with
the
states
and
to
designate
air
quality
control
regions
covering
the
entire
country.
this
could
be
either
entirely
within
the
state
or
they
could
cross
state
lines.
but
the
states
also
have
important
obligations
and
responsibilities
under
the
act
consistent
with
the
findings
of
congress
that
it
was
a
primary
responsibility
of
state
and
local
governments
to
deal
with
air
pollution
at
its
source.
section
107
provides
that
each
state
shall
have
the
primary
responsibility
for
assuring
air
quality
within
the
state
by
submitting
an
implementation
plan
which
would
show
how
that
state
would
attain
and
maintain
the
national
standards
within
each
region,
air
quality
region
in
the
state.
more
specifically,
section
110
(a)
requires
that
each
state
within
nine
months
of
epa's
promulgation
of
a
national
standard
hold
public
hearings,
adopt
and
submit
to
epa
such
an
implementation
plan.
under
section
110
(a),
epa
is
required
to
approve
that
plan
within
four
months
upon
determining
that
it
satisfies
a
test
set
forth
in
the
act.
one
is
of
principal
interest
here,
and
that
is
that
the
plan
must
provide
for
the
attainment
of
national
standards
as
expeditiously
as
possible,
but
in
no
case
later
than
three
years
from
epa's
approval
of
the
plan.
we
refer
to
this
as
the
attainment
date.
attainment
date,
the
date
of
attainment
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
--
of
national
standards.
the
plan
is
also
to
include
emission
limitations,
compliance
schedules
and
other
measures
necessary
to
attain
and
thereafter
maintain
national
standards.
congress
anticipated
that
one
approach
of
state
could
take
in
its
plan
was
to
include
emission
limitations
which
would
be
effective
at
or
near
the
attainment
date,
which
would
give
the
sources
affected
a
lead
time
within
which
to
try
to
comply
with
them.
now
as
the
effective
date
neared,
if
it
seemed
that
a
source
might
still
not
be
able
to
comply,
a
remedy
was
provided
under
section
110
(f),
one
of
the
provisions
involved
here.
that
section
provides
that
prior
to
the
date
that
a
source
of
emissions
is
required
to
comply
with
any
requirement
of
a
plan,
the
governor
of
the
state
can
submit
to
epa
a
request
for
a
postponement
of
the
applicability
of
that
requirement
to
that
source
for
one
year.
epa
is
required
to
approve
such
a
request
if
it
makes
four
determinations.
first,
that
good
faith
efforts
had
been
made
to
comply.
second,
that
the
inability
to
do
so
was
because
the
necessary
technology
or
methods
were
unavailable.
third,
that
interim
measures
had
been
taken
to
reduce
the
impact
of
the
source
on
public
health.
and
fourth,
that
the
continued
operation
of
the
source
is
essential
to
national
security
or
to
public
health
and
welfare.
such
a
determination
by
epa
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
exactly.
i
just
--
must
be
made
after
a
formal
public
hearing
held
by
epa
itself,
and
must
be
accompanied
by
detailed
findings
and
reasons.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
made
on
the
record,
subject
to
adjudicative
proceedings
of
the
epa.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
for
postponement
and
it
subject
to
judicial
review.
now,
congress
recognized
that
the
available
knowledge
of
air
pollution
problems
and
the
resources
of
state
and
the
federal
agencies
in
1970
were
not
necessarily
equal
to
the
task,
of
striking
the
most
refined
balanced
in
the
formulation
of
these
plans,
accordingly,
provided
for
research,
training
and
funding
programs.
in
addition,
lest
these
initial
hastily
reached
judgments
or
possibly
misjudgments
be
immutably
cast
and
steel,
the
act
also
provides
for
revision
of
the
state
plans
in
section
110
(a).
a
revision
could
be
approved
by
epa
only
if
the
state
is
held
the
public
hearing
on
it,
and
if
the
revision
like
the
original
plan
itself
complies
with
the
requirements
of
section
110
(a)
for
plans,
most
significantly,
the
revision
like
the
plan
must
provide
for
attainment
of
national
standards
within
the
three-year
period.
if
it
does
so,
epa
must
approve
it.
upon
approval
by
epa,
the
state
plan
becomes
the
applicable
plan
for
the
purposes
of
the
act.
requirements
of
the
plan
are
then
enforceable
not
only
by
the
states,
but
also
by
epa
and
through
citizen
suits.
now
without
a
revision
of
the
plan
or
a
postponement,
a
source
that
does
not
comply
with
the
requirement
of
a
plan
once
it
becomes
effective
would
be
subject
to
an
enforcement
action.
now
to
assist
the
states
in
this
ambitious
and
cooperative
federal
state
venture,
epa
promulgated
detailed
guidelines
for
the
states
to
use
in
formulating
their
plans,
covering
both
technical
and
procedural
matters
set
forth
in
40
cfr
part
51.
now,
epa
recognized
that
many
states
were
not
prepared
at
that
point
to
engage
in
the
sophisticated
tailoring
of
the
requirements
of
their
plans
to
the
variety
of
situations
presented
in
the
various
regions
within
the
state.
therefore,
the
states
where
initially
permitted
to
develop
emission
limitations
and
other
requirements
more
like
a
butcher
than
a
surgeon
if
you
will.
for
example,
a
state
could
determine
what
was
needed
to
bring
the
worst
source
in
a
region
into
compliance
or
to
permit
attainment
of
national
standards
in
view
of
that
source.
and
then
to
generalize
those
requirements
and
apply
them
to
all
sources
within
that
region
or
to
other
regions,
such
approaches,
and
this
is
not
the
only
one,
built
in
to
plans
a
degree
of
overkill
in
that
many
sources
would
be
required
to
comply
with
the
requirements
which
were
not
necessary
to
attainment
of
national
standards.
now
if
a
national
standard
were
not
being
met
in
a
region
in
1972,
the
practicability
of
attainment
within
the
three-year
period
or
sooner
might
well
be
governed
by
the
ability
to
reduce
or
control
emissions
from
a
single
source
or
a
limited
number
of
sources,
power
plant
or
a
steel
mill
or
smelter
refinery,
whatever.
in
a
period
of
up
to
the
full
three
years
might
be
required
in
order
to
develop
a
necessary
technology,
acquire
the
equipment,
install
it
and
so
forth,
obtain
regulatory
approvals.
if
such
sources
could
not
attain
or
could
not
comply
and
attain
national
standards
prior
to
the
three-year
period,
then
that
became
the
attainment
date
for
those
states.
this
is
mid-1975.
there's
also
provision
for
extension
of
those
dates
in
some
circumstances,
but
they're
not
presently
of
great
moment.
now
where
attainment
prior
to
1975
was
not
feasible
for
these
reasons,
a
state
still
had
some
choice
as
to
when
to
make
the
requirements
of
its
plan
generally
effective.
it
could
make
them
effective
near
the
attainment
date
or
sooner
or
perhaps
immediately,
as
it
might
well
be
feasible
for
many
sources
to
comply
in
a
shorter
period
of
time,
even
though
such
compliance
was
not
necessary
in
order
to
attain
national
standards.
there's
no
dispute
that
the
act
permits
and
indeed
encourages
these
efforts
which
go
beyond
the
minimum
requirements
to
attain
standards.
now,
epa
anticipated
that
there
would
be
inevitably
a
need
for
some
provision
for
variances,
exemptions,
or
deferrals,
either
because
the
state
adopted
plan
requirements
that
were
effective
too
soon
or
overly
strict
or
unrealistically
ambitious
or
for
other
reasons
or
because
of
problems
that
were
simply
not
anticipated
in
1970,
1971,
and
1972
when
the
plans
were
developed,
the
energy
crisis,
the
unavailability
of
equipment
and
the
capital
problems
of
various
companies
being
good
examples.
therefore,
epa
concluded
that
where
a
variance
would
not
interfere
with
the
timely
attainment
or
the
maintenance
of
national
standards,
it
need
not
be
subject
to
the
postponement
procedures
of
110
(f),
and
instead
could
be
treated
as
a
revision
of
a
plan.
epa
included
this
interpretation
in
its
proposed
guidelines
which
published
and
after
receiving
comments
by
nrdc
and
hundreds
of
others,
none
of
which
criticize
this
interpretation.
epa
included
this
interpretation
its
final
guidelines.
now,
while
epa
was
considering
the
plans
submitted
by
that
states
on
the
basis
of
these
guidelines,
nrdc
even
agreed
in
congressional
hearings
that
this
interpretation
was
correct
as
we
have
noted
at
page
31
of
our
brief.
having
no
reason
to
question
its
interpretation,
epa
went
ahead
and
approve
plans
containing
variance
procedures
which
did
not
necessarily
require
resort
to
the
postponement
procedures,
and
this
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we'd
not
interfere
with
either
attainment
of
those
standards
or
maintenance
of
them
after
the
attainment
date.
nrdc
then
changes
position
and
challenge
several
of
those
approvals,
let
me
say
this
problem
arises
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
110
(f)
would
permit
the
postponement
of
the
applicability
of
a
requirement
of
a
state
plan
to
a
source.
it
might
well
as
a
result
make
attainment
or
maintenance
of
national
standards
impossible
if
these
were
the
worst
source
in
the
region,
and
it
got
a
one-year
postponement.
it
might
mean
that
attainment
was
not
feasible.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
as
to
particular
sources.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it
doesn't
postpone
the
attainment
date
itself.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
original
interpretation
was
not
limited
to
the
period
prior
to
attainment.
if
a
variance
would
not
results
in
or
interfere
with
maintenance
of
a
national
standard
after
it
had
been
obtained,
it
could
still
be
treated
under
the
revision
procedures.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right
because
it
wasn't
interfering
with
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i'll
get
to
that,
there
was
a
change.
by
the
time
nrdc
changed
its
position
however,
the
epa's
interpretation
had
been
relied
on
by
the
states
in
developing
their
plans
by
epa
and
approving
them,
and
by
the
various
sources
in
determining
whether
to
challenge
the
state
plans
or
to
seek
variances.
with
this
background,
i'll
turn
to
the
specific
facts.
in
april
1971,
epa
promulgated
national
standards
for
some
six
pollutants.
georgia
submitted
its
implementation
plan
in
january
1972,
having
developed
to
the
intervening
nine
months.
in
georgia
like
all
but
five
states,
there
was
at
least
one
air
quality
region
in
which
the
national
standards
for
one
or
more
of
the
pollutants
was
not
being
met
as
of
1972.
and
like
all
but
three
of
the
states
were
at
least
some
of
the
standards
where
not
being
met
in
some
region,
georgia
concluded
that
it
was
not
practicable
to
attain
those
national
standards
until
the
end
of
the
three-year
period,
mid-1975
should
note
that
since
epa
has
approved
those
attainment
dates,
we
must
accept
here,
the
fact
that
it
was
simply
not
practicable
to
attain
national
standards
any
sooner.
now,
like
the
majority
of
states,
georgia
made
many
of
its
initial
limitations
effective
immediately
or
much
sooner
than
the
actual
attainment
date.
it
either
gave
no
lead
time
or
a
limited
lead
time.
as
a
result,
compliance
problems
where
inevitable
and
georgia
adopted
the
variance
statute
which
is
an
issue
here.
epa
approved
the
georgia
plan,
including
the
variance
statute
in
mid-1972.
now
as
i
mentioned,
section
110
(a)
contemplated
that
the
plans
submitted
by
the
states
would
include
compliance
schedules
which
would
be
adopted
to
assure
that
sources
which
in
1972
were
not
in
compliance
with
the
requirements
needed
for
attainment
of
national
standards
would
be
by
the
attainment
date.
this
is
whether
or
not
the
requirements
were
immediately
effective
or
not,
and
they
could
either
cover
categories
of
sources
or
individual
sources.
if
they
had
been
submitted
as
part
of
the
original
plans,
they
would
have
been
subject
to
approval
without
reference
to
110
(f),
and
subject
to
the
standards
of
section
110
(a).
however,
because
of
the
enormous
demands
imposed
upon
must
states
by
the
task
of
preparing
the
implementation
plan,
georgia
like
most
states,
simply
was
unable
to
complete
the
work
of
developing
compliance
schedules
completely
and
submitting
to
epa
with
its
plan
a
full
array
of
such
schedules.
as
a
result,
after
the
state
submitted
their
plans
and
indeed
after
epa
had
approved
them,
they
continued
working
on
the
development
of
compliance
schedules
and
submitted
them
to
epa.
they
submitted
them
as
revisions
of
the
plans
that
had
already
been
approved,
not
as
postponement
request.
there
are
some
800
of
these
in
georgia.
they're
total
of
3,000
in
the
states
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
many
more
in
the
other
states.
many
of
these
variance
request
compliance
schedules
have
already
been
approved
by
epa.
i
should
note,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
process
has
resulted
in
any
abuse
or
undermining
of
the
purpose
of
the
act
because
they
would
not
be
approved
unless
they
would
not
interfere
with
timely
attainment
of
national
standards
in
many
or
limited
periods
of
time
which
have
already
elapsed.
so
in
practical
effect,
the
basic
question
here
is
whether
such
schedules
and
variances
could
only
be
approved
by
epa
in
accordance
with
the
procedures
of
section
110
(f),
or
whether
epa
properly
construed
its
act
as
permitting
it
to
treat
them
as
plan
revisions.
that's
important
to
emphasize
in
view
of
nrdc's
claims
that
the
case
does
not
involved
merely
attempts
to
extend
the
deadlines
of
previously
negotiated
compliance
schedules,
but
possible
rare
exceptions,
these
variances
and
compliance
schedules
are
the
initial
submissions.
they
are
not
kind
of
going
around
for
a
second
bite
of
the
apple.
nrdc
claims
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
only
procedure
available
for
epa's
consideration
of
these
belatedly
submitted
compliance
schedules
and
variances
is
the
postponement
procedure
of
section
110
(f).
they
would
apparently
require
compliance
with
110
(f),
even
if
the
variance
would
not
interfere
with
timely
obtainment
of
national
standards,
and
even
if
the
problems
calling
for
the
compliance
are
result
of
mechanical
breakdowns
or
tornados
or
whatever.
now,
they
assume
that
110
(f)
is
always
an
available
alternative.
but
as
i
noted
earlier,
by
its
terms,
its
available
only
prior
to
the
time
that
a
source
is
required
to
comply
with
the
requirement
of
a
state
plan.
in
the
states
that
imposed
immediately
effective
requirements,
without
a
revision
of
those
requirements,
110
(f)
would
not
appear
to
be
available
at
all,
even
if
compliance
was
unreasonable,
unnecessary,
or
severe
hardship
would
require
closing
the
plant
down.
now,
the
fifth
circuit's
position
has
been
decisively
rejected
by
the
other
courts
of
appeals.
in
the
cases
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
the
first
circuit
followed
by
the
eighth
and
the
second
held
that
110
(f)
is
the
exclusive
procedure
for
considering
variances
only
in
the
period
subsequent
to
attainment
of
national
standards.
and
even
then,
the
first
circuit
held
that
limited
variances
could
be
granted
without
reference
to
110
(f)
to
account
for
mechanical
breakdowns,
acts
of
god
and
the
like.
now
as
for
the
pre-attainment
period
of
principal
concern
here,
these
courts
held
that
compliance
with
110
(f)
was
not
necessary,
unless
a
variance
would
interfere
with
timely
attainment
of
national
standards.
of
course,
only
rarely
in
the
pre-attainment
period
would
a
variance
threaten
national
standards
because
it's
going
to
run
out
before
the
deadline
comes,
and
since
air
--
even
if
a
source
work
producing
emission
above
the
standards,
once
its
stop
in
compliance,
the
air
disperses
and
value
compliance
state,
it
would
be
at
national
standards.
now,
these
courts
found
such
authority
for
variances
without
reference
to
110
(f)
implicit
in
the
very
structure
of
the
act,
and
the
essential
need
of
flexibility.
having
had
its
authority
sustained
as
to
the
most
important
period,
the
pre-attainment
period,
epa
did
not
seek
review
by
this
court
of
the
limited
adverse
aspects
of
those
rulings.
then
in
september
1974,
epa
revised
its
regulations
to
accord
with
the
first
circuit
ruling,
so
as
to
disapprove
all
state
plans
insofar
as
they
authorize
variances,
including
georgia's
and
post-attainment
period
beyond
the
limited
range
permitted
by
the
first
circuit.
subsequently,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
epa
could
approve
what
it
called
minor
variances,
those
which
would
not
interfere
with
timely
attainment
or
maintenance
of
national
standards
at
any
time,
even
after
the
attainment
date.
now
without
reference
to
section
110
(f),
they
found
this
authority
necessarily
implicit
in
the
act,
and
like
the
first
circuit
but
unlike
the
first,
so
no
reason
for
curtailing
that
essential
flexibility
of
the
attainment
date.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
show
a
preference
for
epa's
original
interpretation
which
is
to
root
this
flexibility
in
the
explicit
revision
procedures
of
the
act.
we
don't
have
any
fundamental
disagreement
with
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
as
suggested
by
some
of
the
amici
that
this
flexibility,
this
provision
is
implicit
in
the
act.
but
as
between
the
first
circuit
and
the
fifth,
we
prefer
the
fifth
as
we've
indicated
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
as
between
the
ninth
and
the
fifth
or
the
first,
we
prefer
the
ninth.
the
case
is
here
only
as
to
the
pre-attainment
period.
so,
there's
no
significant
difference
between
the
ninth
and
the
first
in
that
regard.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
the
first
to
the
fifth
given
that
choice.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
we
don't
like
that
at
all.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right.
we
contend
that
epa
is
interpretation
of
the
act
was
reasonable
and
should
be
sustained.
as
the
briefs
and
the
amici
show
that
that
interpretation's
been
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
states
and
by
the
sources
of
emissions
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i'm
not
going
to
--
yes,
play
very
rapid.
of
course,
we'd
like
to
know
that
now,
the
case
--
the
question
may
come
up
in
the
ninth
circuit
case.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
agency
hasn't
formally
reacted
to
the
ninth
circuit
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
but
we
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes.
so
far
as
i
know,
the
agency
does
not
plan
to
seek
this
court's
review
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
the
other
side
may
well
if
it
that
question
is
not
resolve
in
this
case.
we
think
that
our
rational
for
sustaining
the
agency's
interpretation
as
to
the
pre-attainment
period
would
equally
apply
to
the
post-attainment
period.
so
if
the
court
accepts
our
rationale
that
may
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
foreshadow
the
result
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
no.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
we
would
very
agree
with
the
first
circuit
that
you
can
distinguish
between
the
pre-attainment
and
the
post-attainment.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
it's
not
to
say
rational,
the
same
result.
if
epa
had
adopted
the
fifth
circuit's
approach
of
the
outset,
i
think
it
would
have
been
an
unreasonable
interpretation
which
would
have
disserve
the
purposes
of
the
act.
some
of
the
reasons
that
we've
indicated
in
our
brief
imposed
tremendous
burdens
and
delays
because
epa
itself
would
have
had
to
hold
all
the
hearings
on
variances
that
the
50
states
held,
states
might
have
adopted
the
less
strict
standards
as
a
result
or
made
them
effective
closer
to
the
attainment
date
rather
than
sooner.
and
if
presented
with
the
problems
of
compliance,
they
might
have
revise
the
entire
standard
rather
than
grant
an
exception
for
the
few
who
have
a
difficulty.
now,
epa's
interpretation
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
limited
though
it
is
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief
that
interpretation
was
brought
the
congress'
attention,
explicitly
without
any
sign
of
disapproval.
it's
in
accord
with
the
premise
of
the
act
that
states
have
substantial
responsibilities.
as
we've
indicated
in
our
reply
brief,
it
will
not
threaten
public
health
as
epa's
suggest,
and
i
believe
it's
a
classic
interpretation
of
specialized
agency's
reasonable
interpretation
of
its
own
statute
in
an
effort
to
make
its
pieces
work
and
set
the
programs
in
motion.
it's
entitled
to
the
traditional
and
great
deference
particularly
where
it's
been
so
heavily
relied
upon.
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
should
be
reversed.
i
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
time.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
very
briefly.
if
i
may
respond
just
to
the
standing
question
first
as
been
raised,
i
think
the
statutory
problems
here
demonstrate
why
the
agency's
interpretation
should
be
entitled
to
great
deference.
the
act
is
not
a
really
cohesive
piece.
there
are
different
wordings
in
the
different
standing
or
judicial
review
provisions.
i
don't
know
whether
the
briefs
in
the
lower
courts
include
all
of
the
cases
that
had
been
decided
on
this
question
but
we'll
see
what
they
do
say
in
submit
something
appropriate.
epa's
position,
as
i
understand
it
comes
down
to
the
proposition
that
if
a
state
failed
by
one
day
to
submit
a
compliance
schedule
as
part
of
its
implementation
plan,
it
would
be
completely
out
of
the
picture
his
concept
of
federal
preemption
would
totally
take
over
and
it
be
nothing
left
for
the
state
to
do.
we
don't
see
the
act
is
reading
that
way.
it
would
stand
the
principle
of
cooperative
federalism
on
its
head
to
do
so.
on
the
question
of
the
efficacy
of
the
analysis
of
the
effect
of
a
particular
source
on
air
quality
in
a
region,
first,
that
comes
up
only
in
the
post-detainment
period.
a
pre-attainment
variance
is
not
going
to
have
any
effect
on
the
attainment
of
various
standards.
as
to
the
post-attainment
period,
we've
indicated
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
4
that
the
other
side
is
failing
to
distinguish
between
analyzing
the
effect
of
an
existing
source
and
analyzing
and
predicting
the
effect
of
a
future
source.
and
finally
on
the
question,
the
suggestion
that
somehow
the
case
is
no
longer
alive
because
of
what
has
happened.
first
of
all,
we
don't
know
the
consequences
of
the
fifth
circuit's
ruling
on
variances
which
were
granted
pursuant
to
epa's
longstanding
interpretation.
i
don't
suggest
the
court
has
to
resolve
those
issues,
but
it
does
present
a
live
issue
for
the
sources
in
the
state's
in
question,
and
notices
of
citizens
who's
had
been
filed
in
at
least
some
suits
states.
in
addition,
some
attainment
dates
extent
as
late
as
1977.
thirdly,
the
cycle
that
we've
gone
through
here
of
pre-attainment
period
and
attainment
date
can
be
repeated
because
the
statute
provides
for
the
possibility
of
the
promulgation
of
new
national
air
quality
standards
when
epa
determines
that
there
are
additional
pollutants
that
need
this
treatment.
in
addition,
they
can
revise
the
existing
standards
which
would
again
set
in
motion
the
same
cycle.
and
then
finally,
the
decision
as
to
the
pre-attainment
period
does
have
a
bearing
on
what
the
law
is
for
the
post-attainment
period
as
i've
indicated.
thank
you.
