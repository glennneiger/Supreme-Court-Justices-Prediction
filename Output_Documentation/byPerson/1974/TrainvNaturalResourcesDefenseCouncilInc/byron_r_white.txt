justice
byron
r.
white
you're
going
to
tell
us
what
those
circumstances
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
to
be
made
on
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
made
on
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
those
approvals
were
on
the
assumption
that
limited
variances
would
take
the
state
or
any
stationary
source
beyond
the
attainment
date.
justice
byron
r.
white
postponement
of
this
--
of
the
--
under
the
state
plan
not
a
postponement
of
the
attainment
date
such
as
110
(f)
which
still
permit.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
110
(f)
i
take
it,
would
if
you
go
to
the
110
(f)
procedures
permit
the
state
to
postpone
compliance
beyond
the
attainment
date
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
--
the
agency's
interpretation
would
not
--
unless
you
comply
with
110
(f),
you
couldn't
go
beyond
the
attainment
date.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
carried
it
beyond
the
attainment
date.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
then
you
change
your
mind
because
of
the
ports.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
norton,
just
assume
like
you
know
are
also
now
as
well
as
any
time
whether
the
revision
could
extend
beyond
the
attainment
date.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
going
to
be
--
i
take
it
prospectively
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
going
to
have
to
agree
with
some
one
court
or
the
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
doesn't
cover
the
post-attainment
period
that
it
shouldn't
cover
the
pre-attainment
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
isn't
the
same
rationale
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
your
position
now,
it
wasn't
always.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
forms
of
agreement
during
that
time,
at
the
time
of
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
four
others
are
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
enjoin
the
agency
from
acting
in
accordance
with
its
--
with
a
contra
review
for
the
future?
justice
byron
r.
white
except
the
postponement?
justice
byron
r.
white
epa
is
not
in
compliance
with
fifth
circuit
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
janey
weber
and
susanne
allstrom.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
save
is
a
georgia
--
justice
byron
r.
white
within
the
constitutional
limits?
justice
byron
r.
white
we'll
just
address
to
the
statutory
question
as
to
what
congress
intended
--
the
parties
might
--
who
the
parties
might
be
or
was
--
did
you
address
the
constitutional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
it
didn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
nevertheless
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
permitted
individual
members?
they
permitted
individuals
to
see,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
members
as
individuals
could
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
the
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
there's
no
question
of
the
standing
of
a
resident
of
georgia
for
example
to
attack
the
adequacy
of
the
georgia
--
justice
byron
r.
white
any
resident,
not
just
your
members,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
janey
webber
and
susanne
allstorm
were
not
parties
as
your
members,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
independent.
justice
byron
r.
white
both
citizens
of
georgia.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
suffering
from
--
injured
by
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
proceeding?
