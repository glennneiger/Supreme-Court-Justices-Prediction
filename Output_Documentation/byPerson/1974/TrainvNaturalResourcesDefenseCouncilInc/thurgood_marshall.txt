the
original
complaint.
justice
thurgood
marshall

no.
it's
not
in
mimic
the
document,
is
it
here,
is
it
lodged
with
the
clerk?
justice

justice

no,
this
is
the
senate

to
either
one
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
would
be
in
the
record
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
all
of
these
things
are
here
with
the

justice

does
it
show
anything
about
standing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
where
do
we
get
the
standing
process,
the
factual
basis
for
the
stand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
note
two
with
that
my
question,
i
mean
where
in
the

is
the
material
we
can
use
to
find
out
whether
or
not
your
client
have
standard
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
in
any
of
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
which
arguments
you
come
for
affidavit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
they
acceptable
evidence
that
we
could
consider?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
do
we
have
a
case,
a
controversy
without
that
standing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
say
for
example
that
these
organizations
are
in
there
because
some
of
their
members
in
georgia
will
breathe
that
air.
what
would
that
also
allow
the
chamber
of
commerce
to
join?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
comment
those
organizations
to
join
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
made
cross?
