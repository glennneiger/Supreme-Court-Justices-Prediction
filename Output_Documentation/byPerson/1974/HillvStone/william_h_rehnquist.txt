william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
some
--
i
mean,
i
realize
its
necessary
you
speculative
somebody
--
but
why
do
a
lot
of
people
render
and
some
people
not
render,
is
it
just
a
question
whether
you
want
to
pay
taxes
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
the
23,000
rendering
taxpayers,
were
they
all
owners
of
businesses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
way
of
telling
from
this
record
what
the
nature
of
the
property
rendered
was
on
behalf
of
the
23,000
who
said
they
had
rendered?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
record
doesn't
shed
any
light
on
the
type
of
property
rendered
by
these
23,000?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the
breakdown
is
between
real
property
taxpayers
on
the
one
hand
and
those
who
have
affirmed
the
rendition
of
personal
property
on
the
other?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who's
on
the
other
box?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
although
you
say
that
as
you've
said
as
a
matter
of
practice,
it
tends
to
be
real
property
or
business
personally
that's
rendered
of
--
so
far
as
the
record
has
shown
on
this
23,000
voters
here
who
rendered,
the
record
does
not
show
what
type
of
property
they're
in.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
expect
that
to
be
in
the
record
of
a
district
court
proceeding
when
you're
talking
about
the
rational
basis
for
a
legislative
requirement
and
there
is
a
presumption,
isn't
there
that
the
legislature
may
had
have
a
reason
for
doing
something
and
i
would
think
that's
incumbent
on
the
state
to
produce
evidence
before
the
three-judge
district
court
that
they
in
fact
used
these
mechanisms.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
you
prove
it
by
live
witnesses
and
testimony
at
the
district
court
hearing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
my
suggestion
is
--
my
suggestion
is
that
your
--
the
rational
basis
for
a
legislative
enactment
isn't
something
you
ordinarily
produce
by
question
and
answer
testimony
in
a
hearing
for
the
three-judge
district
court,
that's
frequently
something
that
is
simply
argued
on
the
basis
of
whether
its
arbitrary
and
so
--
but
so
your
suggestion
that
the
record
doesn't
contain
anything,
i
would
find
by
no
means
conclusive.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
salyer,
we
stated
the
holdings
of
the
phoenix
and
cipriano
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
regard
that
as
a
re-affirmance
of
that.
