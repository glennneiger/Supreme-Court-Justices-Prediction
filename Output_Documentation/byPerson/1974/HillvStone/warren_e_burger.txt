chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1723,
hill
against
stone.
mr.
gladden
--
mr.
kendall,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready
after
the
confusion
disappears
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
whether
the
return,
the
rendering
of
a
report
is
true
or
false,
that
that's
also
true.
he
might
be
--
the
taxpayer
might
be
liable
under
some
other
statute
for
rendering
a
false
report.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
rendering
gets
him
on
the
rolls.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
read
in
handy,
the
handy
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
it
were
not
true
then
he
might
be
subject
to
some
penalty
of
perjury
for
making
false
statement
to
get
into
the
pooling
place.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
render
saying
i
have
household
goods
and
furnishings
of
the
value
of
$250.00
and
claim
my
exemption,
is
that
a
rendering?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
could
vote?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
statute
need
not
to
be
rational
to
be
constitutional
if
it
doesn't
hurt
anybody,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
i
reflect
for
a
moment
on
this
in
the
two
states
i've
lived
in
as
a
legal
resident,
minnesota
and
now
virginia,
that's
precisely
what
a
great
number
of
people
do,
they
just
don't
bother
to
make
a
report,
they
permitted
the
assessor,
and
if
you
levy
for
a
household
goods,
a
fixed
percentage
of
the
value
of
their
home
as
the
alternative
and
then
the
automobile
is
taken
off
of
the
automobile
list.
so
i
guess
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you're
dealing
with
our
cases,
counsel,
maybe
it
would
be
a
good
time
to
let
--
to
hear
from
your
friend
and
see
whether
you
have
any
comments
after
he
gets
through
if
you've
covered
your
major
points.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
given
the
hour
of
the
day
it
might
be
helpful
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gladden.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
was
this
rather
unique
provision
adopted
in
texas?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
carried
over
from
the
days
when
it
was
an
independent
republic?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
friend
told
us
that
these
both
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
whether
there
was
going
to
be
a
library
but
only
as
to
what
mode
of
financing
was
to
be
used.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn't
that
vote
on
the
basis
of
what
you
both
have
said
simply
instead
of
local
gallup
poll
on
whether
there
should
be
a
library,
the
city
council
has
the
final
decision
he
said,
your
friend
said.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
case
is
submitted.
thank
you
gentlemen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
73-1723,
hill
against
stone
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
marshall.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
marshall.
