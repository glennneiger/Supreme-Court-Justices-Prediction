mr.
don
gladden
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
if
i
may
go
right
in
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
relative
to
the
practical
application
of
the
texas
law
as
it
applies
to
the
personal
property
or
the
taxing
structure.
what
the
situation
is,
our
real
estate
is
easily
identifiable
and
assessed
by
the
county
tax
assessor
and
the
governmental
entities
that
assess
and
levy
taxes.
personal
property
in
texas
and
incidentally
i
cite
in
our
brief,
51
texas
law
review
885,
the
property
tax
in
texas
under
state
and
federal
law
by
professor
yudof,
fairly
well
outlines
our
facts
as
those
being
the
same
facts
in
the
stewart
case
arising
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
and
that
is
that
you
have
an
all
encompassing
reference
to
all
property
within
the
state
being
taxable
and
then
as
a
practical
matter,
the
collection
is
restrictive
to
real
estate
and
business
property
which
is
easily
discernable.
counsel's
reference
to
his
law
library
being
taxed
in
dallas
is
one
of
those
business
assessments
that
is
made
after
the
time
for
personal
rendition
takes
place.
from
a
practical
standpoint
about
the
only
taxes
that
are
levied
in
texas
are
taxes
on
real
estate,
taxes
on
business
personalty
and
in
about
400
taxing
districts,
taxes
on
automobiles.
most
--
mr.
don
gladden
no,
they're
from
a
practical
standpoint.
no
intangible
property
is
either
voluntarily
rendered
nor
is
there
any
facility
available
for
the
tax
assessor
to
go
out
and
locate
and
identify.
he
does
not
go
to
the
banks
and
assess
bank
accounts
unless
it's
a
business-oriented
or
a
business-committed.
mr.
don
gladden
no
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
don
gladden
by
ad
valorem
taxes
on
real
proper
--
real
and
business
person,
real
property
and
business
personalty
is
where
the
money
comes
from.
mr.
don
gladden
we
have
a
sales
tax.
mr.
don
gladden
we
have
no
state
income
tax.
we
have
a
city
sales
tax
as
well
as
a
state
sales
tax.
mr.
don
gladden
well,
its
kind
of
hard
to
do,
mr.
kendall
can't
point
it
up
that
it
just
isn't
done,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
don
gladden
you
don't
render
--
you
must
already
previously
rendered
it
and
you
must
--
mr.
don
gladden
right,
that's
--
if
you
do
that
and
you're
willing
to
sign
an
affidavit
to
the
effect
that
you
have
rendered
taxable
property.
now,
i
disagree
with
mr.
kendall,
article
3
(a)
does
not
say
rendition
of
nontaxable
property
qualifies
you
to
vote.
mr.
don
gladden
except
for
this
$250.00
exemption
perhaps.
mr.
don
gladden
but
what
section
3
(a)
says
and
this
is
the
section
that
we're
complaining
off.
it
provides
that
a
person
who
is
already
qualified
must
also
be
a
person
who
has
rendered
property
--
wait,
excuse
me
--
tax,
well,
first
of
all
the
city's
ordinance
says
that
it
must
be
taxpaying
voters,
the
--
mr.
don
gladden
yes,
yes.
the
city
ordinance
--
the
city
ordinance
makes
reference
taxpayers,
persons
who
are
taxpayers.
the
state
statute
says
provided
that
a
majority
of
a
qualified
property
taxpaying
voters
of
the
district
and
an
election
to
be
held
for
that
purpose
who
shall
vote
such
tax.
mr.
don
gladden
no,
sir.
he
say
that
you
did
do
that,
yes.
mr.
don
gladden
yes
and
of
course
if
you
had
committed
a
fraud
and
have
not
rendered
that
suit
of
clothes
for
tax
purposes,
then
--
mr.
don
gladden
but
if
you
had,
yes.
mr.
don
gladden
i'm
satisfied
that's
true,
yes.
mr.
don
gladden
presumably.
mr.
don
gladden
well,
this
is
correct
because
as
i
say,
again,
the
stewart
situation
was
this
court
summarily
affirmed
applies
that
from
a
practical
standpoint,
there
is
no
rendition
of
personalty.
the
tax
assessor
after
april
1st
has
the
authority
to
and
does
go
to
business
people
and
does
determine
how
much
of
mr.
kendall's
library
or
his
value
of
his
law
library,
he
does
not
go
out
to
his
house
and
inventory
his
personalty.
mr.
don
gladden
they
were
all
owners
of
real
estate,
your
honor.
mr.
don
gladden
in
most
instances
--
in
most
instances.
mr.
don
gladden
not
in
fort
worth.
mr.
don
gladden
city
of
fort
worth
does
not
even
undertake
to
assess
private
personal
automobile,
business
automobiles
only.
mr.
don
gladden
no
there
is
not.
there
are
some
references
into
it
as
to
the
amount
of
dollar
revenues
that
come
from
personalty
versus
realty
but
there
is
no
reference
as
to
where
that
came
from
business,
interest
which
--
of
course
corporate
interest,
they
have
no
right
to
vote
in
this
type
of
situation
and
of
course
corporate
interest
are
the
family
owners
and
--
mr.
don
gladden
no,
but
let
me
if
i
may
back
up
and
kind
of
orient
--
outline
the
fact
situation
as
to
this
election
and
as
to
the
procedures
that
had
been
followed
to
shed
maybe
the
circumstance
where
we're
confused.
first
of
all,
prior
to
the
three-judge
court
decision
in
phoenix.
in
texas,
only
persons
who
had
rendered
property
and
in
that
instance
for
all
practical
purposes
only
persons
whose
property
had
been
rendered
by
the
tax
assessor
that
being
real
estate
were
privileged
to
exercise
the
ballot.
following
cipriano
and
the
three-judge
court
in
phoenix,
the
attorney
general's
office
established
this
due
election
process
whereby,
he
in
turn
said,
in
order
to
preserve
the
validity
of
bonds
pending
at
this
court's
determination
of
the
constitution
as
it
applies
to
texas
we'll
set
up
a
dual
election
process
and
that
is
those
people
who
come
into,
we
will
for
the
first
time
let
in
essence
none
real
property
owners
come
in
to
the
ballot
box
but
we'll
segregate
their
ballots
and
have
them
cast
in
one
ballots
and
those
who
are
willing
to
affirm
rendition
of
taxable
property
in
another
box,
and
then
we'll
have
a
record
as
to
what
the
facts
are
when
and
if
the
federal
courts
decide
that
our
state
law
is
unconstitutional.
this
has
been
the
procedure
that
has
been
followed
in
texas
since
1969,
since
the
district
court
decision
in
phoenix
and
this
courts
decision
in
cipriano
and
kramer.
mr.
don
gladden
no.
no,
the
rendition,
what
happens
is
if
a
person
comes
into
the
ballot
box,
entered
the
polling
place,
he
is
afforded
since
phoenix
and
since
the
district
court
decision
in
phoenix
in
1969,
he
is
afforded
an
opportunity
to
sign
one
of
two
pieces
of
paper.
one
piece
of
paper
said
i
own
and
have
rendered
property
subject
to
taxation
in
the
city
of
fort
worth
and
i
therefore
am
entitled
to
vote
over
in
this
box.
alright
rather
they
then
the
election
--
mr.
don
gladden
no.
mr.
don
gladden
that's
correct.
mr.
don
gladden
or
business.
mr.
don
gladden
which
had
been
assessed
by
the
tax
assessor.
mr.
don
gladden
which
the
tax
assessor
initiated
the
placing
of
him
on
the
--
mr.
don
gladden
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
don
gladden
okay,
in
the
other
box,
they
come
in
and
then
i
say
from
1969
forward,
up
until
1969,
they
were
not
even
privileged
to
come
on
the
premises
but
from
1969
forward,
they
signed
a
statement
to
the
effect,
i
have
not
rendered
any
property
within
the
taxing
district
and
they
say,
okay,
you
go
vote
over
in
that
box.
so
then
we
have
the
sanctity
of
the
real
property
or
the
--
for
practical
standpoints
the
real
property
owners
preserve
in
that
instance
and
then
we
also
have
to
tabulate
for
no
purpose
actually,
i
think
under
montgomery,
the
remaining
straw
poll
of
those
persons
who
have
neither
rendered
their
property
nor
had
the
tax
assessor
to
come
by
their
business
and
render
it
for
them.
mr.
don
gladden
this
is
--
this
is
quite
correct.
mr.
don
gladden
very
well
could
have.
if
he
renders
it
and
of
course
then
he
is
on
the
tax
rolls
and
the
tax
assessor
sends
him
a
bill
the
next
year
for
his
proportion
of
share.
assuming
that
his
taxable
property
--
mr.
don
gladden
and
of
course
this
is
the
question
that
we've
been
faced
and
the
reason
that
we
only
had
4500
people
vote
in
this
election
was
because
it
was
the
first
time
experience
and
when
you
went
in,
even
the
election
judges
couldn't
tell
you
what
rendition
mean
and
we
found
ourselves
in
a
situation
where
people
in
the
newspaper,
two
column
i
think,
there's
an
exhibit
where
there
is
a
two-column
story
on
the
front
page
of
the
newspaper
explaining
why
for
the
first
time.
people
who
don't
own
real
estate
are
privileged
to
come
and
express
their
opinions
though
they
will
not
be
considered
by
the
attorney
general
in
texas
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
validity
or
the
issuance
of
bond
and
--
mr.
don
gladden
this
is
correct.
then
montgomery
was
decided.
mr.
don
gladden
and
so
then
we
add
additional
confusion.
the
attorney
general's
position
was,
was
i'm
not
going
to
certify
and
it's
his
statutory
responsibility
of
certifying
the
validity
of
the
bond
and
then
not
savable
otherwise.
mr.
don
gladden
the
attorney
general's
position
was
that
but
then
a
--
montgomery
which
was
a
mandamus
brought
by
a
school
district
against
the
attorney
general
seeking
to
require
him
to
certify
where
there
had
been
a
split,
where
the
aggregate
carried
but
it
did
not
carry
in
the
property
owner
box
and
the
texas
supreme
court
said
in
essence
as
i
read
it
that
neither
the
attorney
general
nor
the
phoenix
case
applies
and
that
article
3
of
section
6
of
the
texas
constitution
just
says
real
property
owners
period.
they're
not
real
property,
says
property
owned,
persons
who
have
rendered
property
for
taxation.
and
so,
i
think
that
montgomery
backed
away
from
the
position
of
the
attorney
general
in
this
makeshift
kind
of
a,
we'll
do
it
both
ways,
we'll
look
at
the
aggregate
and
give
the
aggregate
veto
power
but
not
approval
power.
mr.
don
gladden
in
order
to
--
yes,
in
order
again
--
mr.
don
gladden
in
contemplation
of
the
court's
ruling
in
this
case
i
think.
mr.
don
gladden
if
this
court
does
not
uphold
the
lower
court,
the
dual
balloting
system
will
be
dispensed
with
and
we'll
go
back
to
the
initial
section
3
(a)
of
those
persons
who
owned
properties
which
have
been
rendered
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
don
gladden
it
certainly
does.
it
requires
that
you
actually
pay
taxes.
mr.
don
gladden
and
i
think
that
section
3
(a)
contemplates
the
payment
of
taxes.
the
purpose
--
mr.
don
gladden
no,
but
the
purpose
and
if
you
read
montgomery
and
if
you'll
read
the
whole
line
and
counsel's
brief,
the
purpose
of
this
taxing,
of
this
provision
is
to
collect
taxes
not
suffrage
and
of
course,
under
the
poll
tax
case,
the
lines
drawn,
the
requirements
of
this
court
in
limiting
suffrage,
once
that
you've
--
you
afford
everybody
the
opportunity
to
vote,
you
say
people
are
qualified
to
vote
in
elections
and
then
you
say
in
bond
elections,
you
narrow
it
to
a
special
group
of
people
then
you
got
--
it
has
to
be
tailored
to
fit
the
purpose
of
and
i
hardly
need
to
suggest
that
section
3
of
the
constitution
certainly
has
not
been
tailored
to
collect
very
many
taxes.
mr.
don
gladden
it's
there,
its
suppose
to
be
in
conflict
with
--
mr.
don
gladden
it's
in
conflict
with
--
mr.
don
gladden
at
this
point,
we're
attacking
the
ordinance.
for
the
first
time
it's
been
attacking
--
mr.
don
gladden
an
issue
in
this
case
is
suffrage,
whether
of
not
--
mr.
don
gladden
both
the
state
statute,
state
constitutional
provisions
and
the
ordinance.
mr.
don
gladden
and
they're
all
different
and
--
mr.
don
gladden
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
don
gladden
well,
of
course
we
attacked
the
attorney
general's
certification
or
refusal
to
certify
and
that
gave
its
statewide
application
because
we
are
attacking
the
state
constitutional
provisions
which
was
set
out
in
the
phoenix
case
and
referred
in
the
phoenix
case.
mr.
don
gladden
this
is
not
true,
the
city
charter
requires
the
payment
of
taxes,
the
--
mr.
don
gladden
well,
they
are
different
and
in
the
city's
brief
which
incidentally,
the
city
filed
a
brief
as
an
appellee
but
in
support
of
appellant's
contention.
there
are
some
briefs
by
some
other
taxing
districts
or
some
other
districts
including
the
el
paso
junior
college
district
which
was
statutorily
created
by
a
majority
vote
and
given
the
power
to
assess
taxes
by
a
majority
but
restricted
in
bond
elections
to
issue
bonds
for
capital
improvement
to
go
back
and
obtain
not
just
to
general
majority
qualified
voter
but
to
go
the
property
owned
--
those
persons
who
have
rendered
property
for
tax
purposes
to
issue
those
bonds.
mr.
don
gladden
they're
in
support
of
our
position.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
don
gladden
i'm
not
sure
what
the
language
i
think,
the
language
probably
was
drawn
in
the
--
in
the
--
and
i
hand
a
copy
of
that
as
an
exhibit.
i
think
it's
probably
drawn
on
the
state
affidavit
concept
and
that
is
i
own
taxable
property
which
has
been
rendered
for
tax
purposes.
i
disagreed
with
mr.
kendall
that
nontaxable
items
like
household
goods,
a
rendition
of
household
goods
only
would
not
constitute
rendition
of
taxable
property
if
(voice
overlap)
right.
mr.
don
gladden
i'm
not
sure
that
you
do
have,
your
honor.
mr.
don
gladden
it
is
not
a
secret.
it
is
an
available
thing
that's
on
file
along
with
all
the
other
election
returns.
the
list
of
those
persons
who
voted
in
this
box
and
that
box
together
with
the
supporting
signature
on
the
thing
that
comes
in
is
available
to
the
taxing
authority.
mr.
don
gladden
yes.
it's
a
roll
that
you
come
in
and
as
i
say
they
separate
you
as
you
come
in
depending
upon
which
one
of
these
particular
declarations
that
you
signed.
mr.
don
gladden
yes.
on
a
sheet
of
paper
which
is
numbered
in
terms
of
a
registration
that
i
vote,
i
appear
here
today
and
i
voted.
the
particular
instance
though
is
that
there's
no
evidence
of
the
utility
of
this
by
any
taxing
authority
to
go
out
and
render
or
to
find
out
what
that
person
really
does
have
or
to
collecting
the
taxes
from
that
person.
and
so,
from
our
position
is
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
application,
there
are
other
means
by
which
to
collect
taxes.
there
are
far
better
means
than
that
which
is
not
exercised
though
--
mr.
don
gladden
your
honor,
i
think
i
can
in
just
a
moment
find
--
locate
the
language.
okay,
the
ordinance
was
not
applied,
the
language
on
the
certificate
was
cast
on
the
terms
of
the
state
constitutional
provision
which
says
i
own
taxable
property
in
the
district
and
it
has
been
duly
rendered
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
don
gladden
did
not
impair
the
participation,
that's
correct.
mr.
don
gladden
we
--
yes,
yes.
we
raise
and
filed
the
suit
in
the
lower
courts
--
mr.
don
gladden
right.
the
ordinance
provided
that
no
bond
shall
be
issued
unless
authorities
shall
first
be
submitted
to
the
qualified
voters
who
pay
taxes.
and
--
but
it
was
treated
from
a
standpoint
again
from
the
news
media
coverage
of
this
and
from
all
other
purposes
as
being
equating
the
same
as
rendition
either
involuntary.
mr.
don
gladden
yes,
yes.
and
--
mr.
don
gladden
the
texas
constitution
i
think
was,
this
was
adopted
in
1879
and
then
amended
in
1932,
i
believe.
its
my
--
mr.
don
gladden
no,
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
it
was
in
the
provisions
prior
to
independent
republic.
we
went
out
in
1845
and
became
a
state
that
year
and
1879
was
the
last
constitution
that
we
adopted,
this
was
deliberated
on
as
i
recall
--
as
i
--
as
the
historic
background
was.
was
deliberated
on
by
that
constitution
convention
and
it
was
resolved
that
property
owners
were
the
ones
that
ought
to
impose
long
term
obligations
on
the
ad
valorem
tax
base
and
that
has
carried
forward
--
was
carried
forward
up
until
the
phoenix
decision
was
rendered
and
then
it
as
i
say
this
modified
approach
has
been
taken
pending
or
since
the
district
court
in
the
phoenix
case.
we
feel
like
that
this
court
in
the
phoenix
case
outlined,
looked
at
the
texas
constitution
and
footnoted
the
14
states
that
had
no
unique
problems
in
levying
and
collecting
taxes
and
in
turn
found
that
phoenix
could
get
by
--
the
city
of
phoenix
could
get
by
any
taxing
procedures
without
imposing
suffrage
or
imposing
an
additional
requirement
on
a
person's
right
to
vote.
that
was
not
tailored
to
satisfy
an
imperative
need
of
the
state
and
i
think
that's
our
situation
in
this
case.
we
have
a
circumstance
where
if
there
is
no
classification
then
there
is
no
need
to
impose
an
additional
requirement
on
a
voter
that
he
have
made
some
kind
of
a
declaration
to
somebody
at
sometime
prior
to
the
time
he
enters
that
booth
that
has
not
been
acted
upon,
that
has
never
been
used
as
a
basis
upon
which
to
levy
and
collect
taxes,
to
add
that
additional
requirement
and
knowing
mr.
kendall's
--
mr.
don
gladden
however
little
inconvenience.
mr.
don
gladden
i
think
the
right
of
suffrage
mr.
justice
is
one
that
we
need
to
encourage
rather
than
discourage.
mr.
don
gladden
its
well,
it
--
no,
registration
you
can
go
door-to-door
to
assessing
your
personal
property.
i
think
you
got
to
go
down
to
county
courthouse
and
find
somebody
there
who
has
to
go
ask
somebody
where
you
find
the
point.
mr.
don
gladden
no,
i
think
you
got
to
render
it
under
oath
according
to
the
statute.
you
must
--
mr.
don
gladden
i
don't
think
that
--
yes,
yes,
i
think
that
before
you
can
limit
franchise
or
create
a
sub
class
of
qualified
voters
that
are
going
to
pass
on
something
such
as
library
branch
or
such
as
financing
capital
assets
of
a
junior
college
district,
you've
got
to
have
some
rational
basis
for
restricting
that
vote
to
persons
who
have
rendered
property
for
taxation
and
texas
had
just
wholly
failed
--
arizona
wholly
failed
and
its
an
interesting
thing
that
our
sister
state
of
oklahoma
in
1969
twice
ruled
on
that
question
and
found
that
that
kind
of
a
requirement
was
constitutional.
and
then
in
1971,
following
this
court's
decision
in
phoenix,
reversed
itself
and
granted
an
injunction
against
the
application
of
such
a
city
ordinance
and
said,
"we're
going
to
follow
what
the
supreme
court
said
in
phoenix"
and
write
about
the
same
time
that
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
was
doing
that.
and
the
supreme
court
of
texas
will
say,
we
sit
without
talking
about
restricting
voting,
without
talking
about
tailoring
the
restriction
to
fit
that
particular
function
or
need
that
the
state
had
but
just
summarily
said,
we
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong
with
making
people
pay
their
fair
share
of
the
taxes
and
the
tax
assessor
must
exhaust
every
means
of
ferreting
out
and
locating
mr.
kendall's
personal
property
that
he
has
failed
to
render
but
has
had
a
portion
of
it
rendered
by
the
tax
assessor
and
does
qualify
him
to
vote.
i
suggest
that
while
there
may
be,
it
may
not
be
the
wealth
qualification
that
was
raised
in
the
poll
tax.
it
still
is
an
additional
requirement
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
it.
it
does
not
assist
in
the
collection
of
taxes
because
there's
never
been
any
effort
on
the
part
of
and
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
tax
assessor
has
made
him,
these
records
available
to
him
to
render
those
things
to
clear.
mr.
don
gladden
i
think
it
is
in
phoenix.
i
think
phoenix
placed
the
burden
that
when
you
restrict
the
franchise
from
the
general
franchise
classification
to
a
special
franchise
within
that
classification
that
this
incumbent
upon
the
state
to
show
that
there
was
some
imperative
necessity
to
do
that
in
support
of
a
compelling
state
interest.
mr.
don
gladden
there
were
no
live
witnesses.
we
stipulated
all
the
evidence
and
there
was
no
suggestion,
there
was
some
testimony
by
the
city
tax
assessor
that
it's
important
that
we
have
taxes
to
run
our
city.
mr.
don
gladden
well,
i
think
this.
i
think
that
the
court
in
phoenix,
the
court
in
kramer,
i
found
that
before
there
is
a
sub-classification,
a
special
classification
of
voters
and
again
that
classification
nor
that
there
has
to
be
some
basis
--
mr.
don
gladden
compelling
state
interest
and
--
mr.
don
gladden
this
is
a
difficult
thing
to
prove.
mr.
don
gladden
yes,
this
is
correct.
mr.
don
gladden
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
so
construed
it
as
being
in
essence
a
finding
that
that
was
still
the
law
and
--
mr.
don
gladden
okay,
i
don't
think
that
it
have
any
application
at
all
because
people
who
want
to
go
use
the
library
are
not
as
identifiable
in
terms
of
benefit
and
burden
as
there
was
in
each
of
those
cases.
i
think
that
that
is
a
clear
distinction.
i
think
that
and
again
stewart
and
three-judge
court
in
stewart
said
that
just
the
fact
that
you
paid
the
taxes
does
not
create
a
compelling
state
interest
so
as
to
restrict
a
person
to
--
restrict
suffrage
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
have
a
library
or
a
viable
junior
college
district
with
some
buildings.
mr.
don
gladden
an
answer
to
it
is
that
unless
there
is
6.8
million.
now,
we
don't
have
a
library.
we
had
two
issues
in
this
in
the
record.
we
had
two
issues
submitted.
we
had
an
issue
on
whether
or
not
we
bought
a
public
transportation
system.
that
carried
in
the
property
owner
box,
in
the
nonproperty
owner
box
and
in
the
aggregate.
we
bought
the
bus
system
and
we've
got
buses
running.
we
had
another
issue
submitted
the
same
day
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
authorized,
not
compelled
but
authorized
the
city
council
of
fort
worth
to
issue
bonds
for
the
purpose
of
constructing
a
library,
$6.8
million.
that
carried
in
the
property
owner
box,
that
carried
in
the
aggregate
but
it
failed
in
the
proper
--
no,
excuse
me.
it
carried
in
the
nonproperty
owner
box.
it
carried
in
the
aggregate
but
it
failed
in
the
property
owner
box.
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
texas
says
i
will
not
certify
those
bonds
and
absent
that
we
don't
have
the
money
to
build
us
a
library.
mr.
don
gladden
the
city
council
does
not
because
at
this
moment,
they
can't
issue
those
bonds
unless
it
carried
in
those
who
have
rendered
property
for
tax
purposes.
so
--
mr.
don
gladden
if
they
had
general
revenues,
they
could
do
so
but
in
terms
of
creating
a
lien
against
the
ad
valorem
tax
structure,
they
cannot
do
so
absent
approval
of
property
owners.
mr.
don
gladden
okay,
primarily,
the
city
has
real
estate
personal
property
tax
and
a
city
sales
tax
of
1%
of
the
gross
sales
within
--
1%
of
the
gross
sales
within
the
city.
mr.
don
gladden
yes,
it
is
in
addition
to
and
has
to
have
a
referendum
vote
in
that
particular
metropolitan
area
where
they
make
the
assessment.
city
of
fort
worth
does
have
a
city
sales
tax.
mr.
don
gladden
oh!
yes,
we
do
have
some
--
no,
licensing
taxes
were
stricken,
there
used
to
be
a
state
licensing
tax
that
city
piggyback
on
but
it
was
repelled
and
so
the
licensing
tax
failed.
thank
you
very
much.
