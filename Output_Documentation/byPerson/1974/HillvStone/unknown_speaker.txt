unknown
speaker
well,
does
this
add
up
to
the
--
you
have
tax
rolls
and
as
the
name
brennan's
on
it
with
some
property
listed
next
to
it,
he's
eligible
to
vote
because
whoever
put
it
there,
his
property
has
been
rendered?
unknown
speaker
whether
it's
all
my
property
or
a
thousand
part
of
it
doesn't
matter?
unknown
speaker
and
whether
or
not
you
ever
actually
paid
taxes,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
does
he
have
to
be
otherwise
registered?
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
when
the
assessor
goes
to
through
your
office,
he
doesn't
look
in
your
safe
and
find
all
the
securities
there
and
he
just
lists
your
tables
and
chairs,
you're
an
eligible
voter?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
your
next
point
is
that
anybody
could
render
property
if
he
wanted
to?
unknown
speaker
if
he
wants
to
vote,
he
can
vote,
all
he
has
to
do
is
render
some
property
and
everybody
has
got
some
property
to
render.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
one
files
are
returned
showing
no
property,
is
he
then
eligible
to
vote?
unknown
speaker
you
had
a
case
in
texas,
didn't
you
where
five
voters
rendered
$100.00
each?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
held
that
that
--
unknown
speaker
do
the
counties
determine
the
rate
of
tax
or
is
this
determined
--
unknown
speaker
are
this
very
widely
across
the
state?
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
when
one
goes
to
the
poll
i
gather
of
course
there's
a
registration
list,
but
how
does
he
prove
that
he
--
unknown
speaker
just
signs
an
affidavit?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
is
that
true
which
you
just
said.
as
i
understand
it,
it's
the
texas
law
that
if
one
renders
an
incomplete
return
or
a
false
return,
he
qualifies
to
vote
in
this
kind
of
an
election?
unknown
speaker
and
he
doesn't
have
to
file
a
complete
return
as
you
just
indicated?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
may
be
prosecuted
under
some
other
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
know
as
a
--
does
the
record
show
how
many
people
in
fact
file
a
de
minimis
return?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
mr.
kendall
anyway,
speaking
now
of
the
election
process,
one
goes
into
the
voting
booth
and
all
he
does
is
sign
an
affidavit
that
i
have
returned
a
$100.00
cash,
furniture
that
sort
of
thing
and
the
election
board
lets
him
vote,
they
don't
look
behind
it.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
unless
he's
challenged.
unknown
speaker
is
money
renderable?
unknown
speaker
as
cash
in
your
pocket?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
exemptions
do
you
have
for
this
kind
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
what
about
clothing?
no
exemption
at
all?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
indicated
a
little
while
ago
that
someone
without
any
property
at
all
could
not
render.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
suppose
he
went
in
and
just
said
all
i
own
is
a
suit
of
clothes?
unknown
speaker
let's
render
it.
now,
and
i
gather
if
i
understand
what
you
said
about
your
supreme
court
opinion,
it's
immaterial
whether
he
pays
a
tax
or
not.
unknown
speaker
he
still
may
vote?
unknown
speaker
therefore,
it's
not
like
a
poll
tax
case
where
you
can't
vote
unless
you
pay
the
poll
tax?
unknown
speaker
even
though
that's
only
a
dollar
or
two.
the
tax
and
the
suit
of
clothes
might
be
50
cents
but
even
he
don't
pay
he
can
vote,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
is
there
one
day
in
a
year
you
can
render?
unknown
speaker
but
as
a
--
unknown
speaker
you
mean
on
any
date
within
that
period
of
time
or
is
it?
unknown
speaker
before
what
day?
what
is
your
assessment
date?
unknown
speaker
this
i
think
is
what
justice
white
is
asking.
unknown
speaker
on
april
1st
you
could
at
least
remember
you
had
one
meal
that
day,
you
could
render
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kendall,
i
suppose
there
are
other
laws
which
impose
an
obligation
on
you
independently
of
the
right
to
vote,
to
render
taxable
property,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
have
a
$500.00
bank
account
and
do
not
render
it
then
you
violated
texas
law?
unknown
speaker
is
there
--
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
form
provided
for
taxpayers
to
fill
out
for
rendering
property?
unknown
speaker
you've
never
filled
one
out
yourself?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
know
then
whether
the
rendition
or
the
rendering
by
the
authority
is
a
true
and
correct
rendition
if
you
haven't
done
it
yourself?
unknown
speaker
complete
as
to
your
holding.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
how
was
the
texas
system
rational
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kendall,
is
there
anything
in
this
record
which
indicates
the
differences
statute
has
made
in
voting
on
this
bond
issue?
unknown
speaker
and
what's
the
--
by
a
reason
of
this
requirement,
how
many
people
were
not
--
votes
were
not
counted?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
recall.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
get
again
majorities
oppose?
unknown
speaker
when
you
did
then
you
were
safe?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
get
over
the
--
unknown
speaker
as
between
those
who
rendered
and
those
who
didn't
render,
what
were
the
proportions?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
a
vote
who
rendered?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
talking
about
21,000?
unknown
speaker
and
the
other
--
unknown
speaker
that's
about
6,000,
no,
4,500
is
it?
unknown
speaker
4,800
against
21,000
who
rendered
and
5,000
who
didn't?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
statute
say
as
to
sanctions
for
not
rendering?
unknown
speaker
if
the
assessor
got
it
wrong?
unknown
speaker
you
already
know
where
it
go.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
gladden,
are
you
suggesting
disagreement
with
the
--
with
mr.
kendall
by
--
when
i
asked
him
earlier,
suppose
one
simply
went
in
and
signed
an
affidavit
and
said
i
rendered
a
suit
of
clothes
that's
all
i
owned,
and
he
said
that
if
one
did
that
at
the
polling
place,
he'd
be
permitted
to
vote?
unknown
speaker
yes,
would
you
then
be
able
to
be
permitted
to
vote?
unknown
speaker
well,
(inaudible)
but
you
did
--
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
that
then
you'd
be
permitted
to
vote?
unknown
speaker
so,
one
doesn't
have
to
pay
the
tax
on
the
suit
of
clothes,
50
cents,
25
cents,
or
whatever
it
may?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
that
sense,
as
under,
read
judge
thornberry's
opinion
that
one
of
the
grounds
in
which
he
found
this
unconstitutional
was
that
its
like
the
whole
tax
case,
our
harper
case
but
you
had
to
pay
the
poll
tax
before
you
could
vote
but
here
as
i
understand
it,
if
i
correctly
understand
you,
you
don't
have
to
pay
the
tax
from
the
suit
of
clothes
as
long
as
you
rendered
the
suit
of
clothes
and
you
may
vote,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
or
automobiles?
unknown
speaker
or
automobiles?
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
that
order
said
you
didn't
say
what
the
property
was?
unknown
speaker
i
own
and
have
rendered.
unknown
speaker
could
have
been
somebody
who
was
interested
enough
to
write
a
letter
and
say,
“i
hereby
render
a
$100.00
worth
of
property
because
--
and
ps
this
is
because
i
want
to
vote”
and
then
he
goes
in
and
he'd
perfectly
qualified
to
vote.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
in
order
to
play
it
safe?
unknown
speaker
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
there's
one
other
little
fish
hook
in
this
case
and
that
is
that
the
fort
worth
ordinance
seems
to
require
something
additional.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
say
so?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
quite
understand,
if
your
supreme
court
has
said,
rendition
entitles
you
to
vote
not
withstanding
you
don't
pay
the
tax.
how
can
your
city
have
an
ordinance
which
requires
you
to
pay
the
tax
as
a
rendition
to
vote?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
that
device
is
--
unknown
speaker
can
the
--
or
can
the
ordinance
stand
up
against
that
interpretation
--
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
is
the
ordinance
--
is
the
ordinance
or
the
state
statute?
unknown
speaker
are
they
different?
unknown
speaker
since
when
--
if
it
were
only
the
ordinance,
i
don't
suppose
the
three-judge
court
would
have
any
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
but
the
three-judge
court
must
have
voted
in
the
same
poll
in
this
description
at
the
outset,
he
talks
about
the
in
one
perhaps
about
--
talking
about
the
laws
of
the
state
and
then
at
the
city
charter?
unknown
speaker
you
talk
about
they're
all
the
same
--
same
way?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gladden
--
unknown
speaker
in
the
election
that
you've
been
talking
about,
was
the
fort
worth
ordinance
applied
as
i
understood
what
you
said
earlier,
a
voter
who
entered
the
booth
on
a
polling
place
was
given
the
opportunity
of
going
in
one
of
two
voting
booth,
in
one,
he
would
sign
a
certificate
of
some
sort
saying
he
had
rendered
property,
was
he
also
required
in
fort
worth
to
say
that
he
not
only
rendered
it
but
pay
taxes?
unknown
speaker
so
maybe
that
the
--
excuse
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
simply
going
to
ask
whether
if
the
ordinance
was
not
applied
in
this
case,
we
have
that
ordinance
or
its
validity
before
us?
unknown
speaker
another
question
i
want
to
ask
about
the
certificates
of
one
signs.
is
that
--
does
that
signature
enjoy
the
secrecy
of
the
ballot
box
or
is
your
name
signed
to
it
and
your
name
been
made
available
to
the
taxing
authorities?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
separate
piece
of
paper
from
the
ballot?
unknown
speaker
so
you
sign
your
name
on
a
book,
perhaps?
unknown
speaker
i
might
say
that
there
really
is
--
rather
makes
some
big
difference
to
me
whether
or
not
that
ordinance
was
applied
to
those
who
are
permitted
to
vote
as
having
rendered.
unknown
speaker
so
the
ordinance
really
was
--
unknown
speaker
so
when
you
say
you're
attacking
the
ordinance,
did
you
mean
by
that
attacking
it
before
this
court?
unknown
speaker
but
if
unless
it
apply?
only
do
the
extent
that
it's
gone
so
far
as
the
state
law?
unknown
speaker
as
if
it
read
to
a
liable
to
pay
taxes
rather
than
--
unknown
speaker
however
little
inconvenience
it
involved?
unknown
speaker
too
much
constitutionally
in
the
way
of
a
burden.
unknown
speaker
or
you
have
other
lawyers?
unknown
speaker
but
even
so,
even
if
it's
only
writing
a
letter,
do
you
still
suggest
that
involve
and
that's
too
much.
unknown
speaker
up
to
this
point
until
just
now,
you
haven't
mentioned
neither
salyer
or
toltec.
unknown
speaker
build
them
on
general
revenues
if
they
had
them,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
sources
of
revenue
in
fort
worth
city
other
than
real
estate
and
personal
property
tax?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
addition
to
the
states
sales
tax?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
licensing
taxes?
unknown
speaker
diamond
ring.
unknown
speaker
it's
just
an
authorizing
vote,
--
