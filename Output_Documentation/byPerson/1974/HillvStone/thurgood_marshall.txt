to
whistle
in
fact,
i
don't
know,
make
law
without
a
rendering,
is
that
what
you
do
to
the
taxes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
texas.
under
texas
law,
only
those
residents
of
an
election
district
who
have
“rendered”
their
properties
for
taxation
are
permitted
to
vote
in
local
board
elects
--
on
the
elections.
this
means
that
only
those
who
list
their
real,
mixed,
or
personal
property
with
the
local
tax
assessor
are
granted
the
franchise.
a
group
of
residents
of
fort
worth,
texas
brought
this
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
seeking
to
invalidate
that
restriction.
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
applicable
texas
laws
limiting
the
franchise
to
those
who
surrendered
property
for
taxation
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
an
opinion
on
file
to
the
clerk
today,
we
point
out
that
in
kramer
versus
the
union
school
district,
we
held
that
as
long
as
an
election
is
not
one
of
special
interest,
a
state
cannot
erect
a
classification
restricting
the
franchise
on
grounds
other
than
residence,
age,
and
citizenship
unless
that
classification
satisfies
a
compelling
state
interest.
and
again
in
the
city
of
phoenix,
we
held
that
a
general
obligation
of
revenue
bond
elections
are
elections
of
general
interest
subject
to
the
principles
of
the
kramer
case.
accordingly,
since
the
restrictions
in
this
case
serve
no
compelling
state
interest
consisted
election
was
one
of
general
interest,
the
franchise
restriction
cannot
stand.
we
therefore
affirm
the
opinion
of
the
--
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
stewart
joined.
mr.
justice
douglas
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
