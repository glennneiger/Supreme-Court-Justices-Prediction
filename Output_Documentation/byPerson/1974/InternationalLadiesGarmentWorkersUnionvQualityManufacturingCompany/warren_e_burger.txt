we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-765,
international
ladies'

workers'
union

mr.
dunau.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
a
private
lawyer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
1
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dunau,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
cited
us
any
cases
mr.
dunau
on
this
matter
of
having
some
next
trend
or
representation
in
grievance
procedures
generally?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it's
common
practice
in
grievance
procedures
to
have
the
employee
accompanied
by
someone,
is
it
not
the
shop
steward
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
except
the
employer
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
do
i
understand
that
what
you're
telling
us
now
is
that
the
employer
could
reject
the
presence
of
the
second
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
did
not
--
that
means
in
response
to
mr.
justice
white
to
say
that
if
there
were
substantial
grounds
for
the
discharge,
the
discharge
could
be
sustained
on
its
merits.
so,
did
you
answer
it
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
i'm
a
little
bit
lost
as
to
what's
the
consequence
of
refusing
a
conference
with
the
presence
of
the
second
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
employer
could
refuse
to
permit
the
second
person
to
be
present
but
he
would
nevertheless
be
sustained
in
the
dismissal
if
he
had
appropriate
grounds
independent
grounds?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jenkins.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
language
through
representatives?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
see
any
analogy
even
remote
mr.
jenkins
between
the
argersinger
case
which
is
in
and
totally
different
field
in
the
criminal
flied
where
this
court
held
that
if
a
penalty
of
confinement
is
to
be
imposed
there
must
be
a
lawyer.
now,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
case
of
trial
is
invalid
if
it
is
held
without
a
lawyer
but
what
it
does
mean
is
that
if
the
judge
elects
to
go
ahead
without
a
counsel,
without
appointing
counsel
where
there
is
the
potential
for
confinement.
he
may
not
make
the
judgment
a
valid
judgment
of
confinement
at
the
end
of
that
proceeding,
is
there
any
analogy
that
you
see
here
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
the
judge
has
to
do
under
argersinger?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
regard
the
fourth
circuit's
utterances
on
this
other
area
as
dictum
in
the
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dunau,
i
think
your
time
is
expired.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
brennan.
