mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
raises
an
interesting
question
before
the
court
to
determine
the
scope
of
the
right
of
an
employee
to
representation
and
his
dealings
with
management.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
simple.
the
issue
in
the
case
i
think
everybody
agrees
on
and
the
under
penning
legally
of
where
the
authority
lies
to
order
such
a
right
by
an
employee
is
not
in
dispute
since
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
its
been
amended.
now,
a
number
of
situations
exist
with
respect
to
the
possible
scope
of
representation
rights
of
an
employee
under
section
7
of
the
act.
there
is
nothing
in
the
wording
per
se
of
this
section
of
the
act
which
really
throws
any
direct
light
on
the
subject.
for
example,
there
is
nothing
in
section
7
that
says,
“an
employee
shall
have
the
right
to
a
representative
and
that
these
situations
or
spells
it
out.”
the
act
simply
says
that
an
employee
has
the
right
to
engage
in
collective
activity
concerted
activities
as
the
actual
word
of
the
statute
for
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
and
other
mutual
aid
and
protection.
well,
the
word
concerted
of
course
has
a
technical
meaning
that
is
being
considered
by
a
number
of
courts
and
it
is
generally
been
held
to
mean
group
activities
for
representation
activities
that
the
group
as
a
whole
was
interested
in.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
to
engage
in
concerted
activities
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
other
mutual
aid
or
protection
through
representatives.
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
word
“concerted”
embraces
one
employee
such
as
we
have
in
each
aspect
of
this
case
or
in
many
the
cases
that
have
been
held
whether
that
concerted
applies
to
them
with
respect
to
their
own
individual
rights
with
respect
to
an
employer
at
the
time.
for
example,
in
a
disciplinary
situation
involving
one
employee
does
that
involve
a
concerted
or
group
activity.
now,
there
it
is
clear
that
where
a
group
activity
is
involved
then
the
employee
have
a
right
to
representatives.
but
it
does
not
say
as
i
read
the
act
here
that
an
employee
has
the
right
to
a
representative
to
handle
his
own
personal
individual
problems
which
may
arise
on
a
one
to
one
relationship
between
himself
for
his
employer.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor,
it
does
not.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes
sir,
that
is
the
clause
which
we
all
agree
that
if
there
is
a
statutory
right
to
the
employee
to
have
a
representative
it
flows
from
that
specific
language
and
the
specific
phrase.
in
section
7
which
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
that's
right.
we
all
agree
that
if
there
is
the
power
or
the
right
it
comes
from
those
specific
words.
now,
it's
interesting
i
think
when
you
look
back
over
the
history
of
this
situation
that
no
court
and
certainly
not
the
labor
relations
board
has
ever
said
that
on
the
basis
of
that
language,
an
employee
has
the
right
to
a
representative
with
him
at
all
times
and
at
all
places
under
all
circumstances.
in
other
words,
no
one
has
ever
contended
that
that
language
there
gives
a
broad
across
the
board
right
to
an
employee
to
have
a
friend
with
him
or
to
have
a
union
representative
with
him
under
any
circumstances
when
management
plucks
to
him.
down
through
the
history,
up
until
quality
came
alone
over
a
period
of
almost
25
years.
the
rights
in
this
regard
were
exceedingly
limited.
a
dichotomy
had
developed
by
virtue
of
board
decision.
a
division
of
this
whole,
if
you
please
which
would
the
whole
being
of
the
right
of
an
employee
to
have
a
representative
with
him
at
any
time
under
any
circumstances.
no
one
said
that
was
the
status
of
the
law.
no
one
interpreted
section
7
that
way,
but
they
carved
off
one
piece
of
that
whole
and
said,
that
where
there
is
an
interview
being
taking
place
between
employer
and
employee.
in
that
situation,
and
where
it
is
not
an
investigatory
a
fact-finding
talk
of
interview.
in
other
words,
an
interview
first
amend
contracted
further
to
a
particular
kind
of
interview
one
that
was
not
investigatory
or
fact
finding
but
one
which
had
to
do
with
the
imposing
of
discipline
--
a
decision
by
an
employer
to
an
employee
passing
judgment
upon
his
case
of
a
problem
and
that
very
limited
area
and
those
circumstances,
an
employee
had
a
right
to
have
a
representative
present
to
him
in
those
particular
times.
now,
whether
this
is
a
dichotomy
that
is
based
upon
any
real
rational
reason
or
not,
is
something
that's
debatable.
but
nevertheless,
that
is
the
way
the
law
developed
for
some
25
years
up
until
quality
came
along.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
under
when
the
investigation
or
the
purpose
of
the
conference
was
to
pass
judgment
on
him
when
it
was
disciplinary
in
nature
what
he
was
being
brought
in
to
say
you
are
suspended
for
two
days.
you
are
no
receiving
a
verbal
warning,
you
are
being
discharged
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
reason
why
it
should
logically
have
developed
in
the
law
this
way,
i
think
is
understandable.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
don't
know
your
honor.
there
is
no
way
here
that
we
can
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
this
is
what
mrs.
--
let
me
say
this
your
honor
first
and
the
reason
i
say,
we
don't
know
for
sure.
first
of
all,
the
employee
involved
here
did
not
testified
to
hearing.
she
was
--
i
understand
quite
ill
at
that
time
as
see
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon,
sir.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
so,
we
don't
know
what
she
thought
about
the
situation.
secondly,
we
don't
know
for
sure
what
happened
in
the
incident
up
on
the
floor.
the
only
thing
that
we
do
know
is
that
light
of
mrs.
gerlach
through
her
opponent
is
that
she
was
concerned
about
the
sassing
incident.
that's
the
only
evidence
that
we
have.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
have
evidence
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well,
it's
certainly
we
can
speculate
that
it
could've
been
because
work
was
disrupted.
there
was
comment
in
the
evidence
about
that
up
there.
the
employee
had
stopped
and
several
other
machine
operator
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
it
could
i
would
say.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
because
there
had
been
no
decision
on
the
part
of
the
company,
at
that
time,
to
impose
discipline.
we
don't
know
what
the
result
what
have
been.
how
do
we
know
if
mr.
gerlach
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
the
history
of
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
don't
know
because
i
think
the
history
is
interesting
here.
she
had
been
an
employee
of
this
company
for
many,
many
years
and
the
evidence
undisputed
was
that
she
had
gone
on
her
own.
sometimes
three
or
four
times
a
day
for
a
conference
with
mr.
gerlach,
the
president.
evidently,
there
was
quite
a
rapport
or
at
least
a
facility
of
communication
between
the
two,
one
on
one
in
his
office.
and
i
don't
know
what
mr.
gerlach
if
he
had
the
decision
i
think
it
would've
been
what
he
would've
done
in
this
situation.
he
may
have
this
in
plunder.
he
may
have
said,
“get
on
back
to
work”
and
not
discipline
her.
we
don't
know
because
there
is
no
evidence
here
as
to
what
he
would've
done.
we
were
not
at
that
stage
in
this
case.
we
were
in
the
stage
where
she
was
being
given
the
right
to
come
before
him
and
give
him
her
side
of
the
story.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes
she
was
ordered,
she
was
both
ordered
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
it
is
a
combination
of
both.
if
i
were
in
mr.
gerlach
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well,
she
was
fired
not
for
what
she
said
to
him
but
the
fact
that
she
were
not
discussing
with
him
at
all
without
a
representative
present
which
gets
to
her
legal
right
in
this
case
is
to
whether
she
was
legally
right
or
not.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that
i
understand
is
the
position
of
the
board
and
the
courts
at
present.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
it's
a
very
fussy
line,
your
honor
and
it
has
been
spelled
out
on
a
case
per
case
basis
only
with
general
terminology
and
the
terminology
is
that
where
the
--
in
procedure
is
at
the
point
where
the
decision
by
the
company
has
been
as
to
what
it's
going
to
do.
in
other
words,
it's
ultimate
disposition
of
the
theft
problem
or
whatever.
at
the
point,
if
he
calls
the
employee
in,
the
employee
has
a
statutory
section
7
right
or
under
some
other
section,
it
is
not
clear
to
have
a
representative
present
but
up
until
that
point,
they
do
not.
and
the
reason
in
the
rational
for
that
i
think
is
clear.
management
in
managing
of
this
is
needs
a
free
flow
of
information.
we
hope
that
we
do
not
get
into
the
relevant
of
our
labor
law
to
a
situation
where
an
employer
and
an
employee
cannot
talk
directly
to
each
other
on
some
matters.
and
i
guess
the
problem
here
is
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
are
some
and
which
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
representation
and
there's
others
when
they're
not.
certainly,
if
we're
in
a
situation
where
an
employer
says,
“how's
the
weather
outside
today?”
and
the
employee
says,
“i'm
not
going
to
answer
until
i
get
my
union
representation.”
everybody
would
agree
that
would
be
in
absurdity.
and
then
we
move
from
there
on
closer
to
the
involvement
of
the
employee
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
would
think
not
your
honor.
and
the
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
i
see
the
apparent
analogy
your
honor.
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
will
work
in
the
industrial
relations
error
because
here,
you
would
have
to
--
in
the
industrial
relation
situation
you
would
have
to
presuppose
what
the
probable
end-result
of
the
investigation
procedure
was
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
maybe
in
a
criminal
situation
but
in
the
criminal
situation
you
reach
a
conclusion
before
the
court
and
in
a
labor
situation
you
don't.
there
are
as
if
for
instance
an
employee
gives
information
to
the
company
and
the
company
then
determines
at
a
later
time
to
discharge
the
employee.
the
employee
if
he
has
the
union
representation
get
arbitrate
the
reasonableness
of
that.
there's
step
beyond
the
court
available
to
him
but
here
in
industrial
life
and
i'm
not
sure
that
while
a
job
rights
are
quite
important.
i'm
not
sure
they're
also
equated
with
the
person's
civil
rights
and
liberties
as
they
would
be
in
the
case
that
your
honors
suggest.
the
courts
have
generally
rejected
the
analogy
between
the
escobedo
type
of
doctrines
which
have
attempted
in
some
instances
to
be
applied
to
the
industrial
fields.
they
are
simply
talking
about
rights
of
different
significance
and
order
and
do
not
feel
their
proper
analogies.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that's
right
and
then
the
question
of
just
cause
which
is
the
most
universal
standard
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
the
distinction
of
the
court
as
i
understand
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
distinction
in
the
state
of
the
mind
of
the
employer
should
be
controlling
in
any
event.
i
don't
think
this
dichotomy
that
the
labor
board
has
developed
between
when
you're
in
the
investigatory
face
and
when
you're
in
the
decision
or
disciplinary
face
is
a
real
one.
this
is
a
practitioner
speaking
who
has
to
make
practical
applications
at
the
lowest
level
at
the
plant.
and
we
are
looking
as
such
as
for
clear
cut
rules
and
we
don't
like
the
rules
of
law
to
be
the
base
upon
the
subjective
state
of
mind
of
the
employer.
let
me
draw
an
analogy
if
i
can.
i
was
interested
in
the
discussion
this
morning
on
gissel.
gissel
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
gissel
was
my
client
and
i
was
here
on
that
and
i
recall
how
astounded
we
were
when
the
gissel
case
was
argued
that
the
brief
of
the
board
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
on
the
question
of
the
good
faith,
there
were
doubt
took
a
totally
different
view
in
their
brief
here
than
they
had
ever
before
and
they
backed
off
of
that
good
faith
doubt
because
simply
it
doesn't
work
in
practice.
and
our
problem
with
quality
here
is
exactly
the
same.
we
see
the
board
in
quality
moving
into
the
same
legal
psychological
realm
with
respect
to
section
7
right
here
as
they
did
under
the
good
faith
doubt.
in
gissel
with
a
prior
to
that
they
were
psychoanalyzing
the
employer
to
find
out
if
he
between
his
years
had
a
good
faith
doubt.
here,
even
worst
than
that
we
are
psychoanalyzing
the
employee
and
we
are
making
the
employer
unfair
labor
practice
depend
upon
an
assessment
of
the
psychological
or
beliefs
of
the
employee.
because
the
exception
that
the
board
would
carve
out
here
in
quality
as
i
understand
it.
it
says
this,
“that
even
if
the
interview
was
investigatory
and
it
is
not
disciplinary
even
at
that
stage
we're
going
to
widen
the
circle
a
little
further
and
whether
the
conditions
of
that.”
we're
going
to
widen
the
circle
an
inch
further
to
cover
the
situation
where
the
employee
between
his
years
thinks
that
there
may
be
reasonable
probability
of
discipline
at
the
end
of
the
line.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
the
answer
your
honor,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
it
follows
--
and
i
think
this
follows
from
the
plain
reading
of
section
7
because
it
doesn't
provide
for
it
in
there.
and
but
--
let
me
just
case
to
add
that
that
is
not
the
position
that
the
labor
board
has
taken.
they
have
taken
there
are
some
instances
namely
when
discipline
is
involve
and
the
courts
have
upheld
them
with
respect
to
that
right.
but
i
think
the
problem
here
in
this
decision
to
those
of
us
who
are
practitioners
is
that
we
have
a
situation
where
the
scope
of
the
employee's
rights
have
been
spelled
out
in
case
after
case
over
this
period
of
time.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
oh!
i
would
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
feel
that
section
provides
for
that
and
i
think
that
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
and
it
would
put
us
in
the
position
of
trying
to
decide.
well,
what
the
end-result
and
suppose
that
your
honors
where
the
employer
most
of
these
investigations
start
out
when
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
is
to
find
out
what
the
end
will
be.
and
yet
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
that's
the
rule
now
with
the
board
and
the
courts
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon,
sir?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that
is
why
we're
here
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no
your
honor,
i'm
not.
i
think
it's
a
distinction
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that
is
correct
because
and
i
think
that
we
may
suppose
also
that
this
is
a
view
that
congress
make
take
out
but
at
least
to
so
far
as
the
extension
proposed
in
this
act.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
they
have
gone
the
extra
inch
or
further
than
that
now
to
raise
that
and
i
suppose
we
might
presuppose
that
the
next
step
would
be
you
can
have
represent
a
person
anytime.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
they
didn't.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
they
denied
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes
your
honor
i
do
because
i
think
that
for
the
purposes
of
disposition
of
this
case,
the
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
took
a
sufficient
but
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
still
would
allow
a
certain
area
of
representation
that
i
feel
is
not
spelled
out
clearly
in
this
act
here.
so,
you
find
a
--
it's
a
question
of
course
of
where
you're
going
to
draw
the
line
and
how
wide
and
under
what
circumstances
you're
going
to
say
that
the
law
requires
that
an
employer
permit
an
employee
to
have
a
representative
present
with
him.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
think
so
your
honor
because
i
don't
think
they
were
necessary
to
dispose
of
this
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes
i
am.
should
the
--
the
grammar
is
not
accurate
of
course
your
honor
that
is
referring
to
the
circuit
--
seventh
circuit.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
part
of
it,
yes
your
honor.
in
closing,
i'd
like
to
make
a
comment
that
it
would
seem
that
the
exception
or
the
provision
for
representation
which
the
petition
here
is
arguing
for
which
labor
board
requires
namely
representation
where
the
employee
has
reasonable
cost
to
believe
that
disciplinary
action
may
result
sets
up
a
criteria
of
the
existence
or
nonexistent
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
an
employer
upon
the
fears
of
an
employer
--
of
employee.
if
the
employee
fears
that
he
may
be
disciplined
no
matter
how
slight
then
under
the
board
rule
he's
entitled
to
representation.
but
it
is
the
employer
who
must
make
a
decision
without
the
facts
as
to
whether
or
not
this
fear
is
reasonable
or
whether
or
not
this
fear
is
justified.
and
i
do
not
think
the
flowing
of
statutory
rights
of
representation
should
be
present
or
nonexistent
depending
upon
whether
an
employee
fears
a
certain
result
or
whether
he
is
completely
without
fear
on
the
subject.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor
exactly.
thank
you.
