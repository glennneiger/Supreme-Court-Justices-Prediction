justice
potter
stewart
and
all
of
these
mr.
dunau
against
the
background
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
the
silent
of
the
subject,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
their
claim
is
that
the
law
--
the
statute
requires
--
justice
potter
stewart
when
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
when
there
is
a
bargaining
representative?
justice
potter
stewart
but
how
can
you
do
what
in
the
absence
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
the
absence
of
bargaining
representative
the
employment
would
be
an
employment
at
will,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case
mr.
dunau,
there
have
been
reasonable
belief
as
a
matter
of
discharge
when
she
didn't
done
anything
that
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
permitted
discharge,
isn't
that
she?
justice
potter
stewart
that
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
would
warrant
discharge
all
that
she
have
done
is
along
with
her
four
other
people
in
the
morning
and
protested
that
the
existing
piecework
wage
rate
hardly
allows
him
to
make
a
living.
justice
potter
stewart
of
what?
justice
potter
stewart
79?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
could
that
--
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
could
he
has
been
discharged
or
suspended
for
being
sassy?
justice
potter
stewart
what
did
the
agreement
provide
the
suspension
or
discharge?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
junior's
answer
might
have
been
there?
justice
potter
stewart
in
section
7
and
gives
the
right
that
you
were
asserting?
justice
potter
stewart
and
nothing
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
could
supersede
it,
could
it?
if
any
employee
is
entitled
statutorily
under
section
7
to
bring
any
person
of
her
choosing
who
was
a
fellow
employee.
i
don't
think
it
would
cover
a
lawyer
but
collective
or
concerted
activity
for
other
mutual
aid
or
protection
that's
the
language
you
were
relying?
justice
potter
stewart
right
after
the
grievance
is
filed?
justice
potter
stewart
but
mr.
dunau,
the
employer
in
your
submission
cannot
refuse
to
allow
the
second
person
to
be
present
at
the
interview.
he
must
either
accept
the
second
person
at
the
interview
or
not
have
the
interview.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
take
it
if
you're
going
to
look
at
the
statutory
language
it's
maybe
rather
important
to
look
at
it
a
little
more
carefully.
the
representative
language
has
to
do
only
with
the
collective
bargaining.
justice
potter
stewart
the
right
to
bargain
collectively
through
representatives
of
their
own
choosing,
as
i
understand
it,
that's
not
involved
here.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
involved
here
is
the
phrase
or
the
clause
and
to
engage
in
other
concerted
activities
for
the
purpose
of
collective
bargaining
or
other
mutual
aid
or
protection.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
engaged
in
others
concerted
activities
for
other
mutual
aid
or
protection,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
long
as
you
concede
entitle
to
have
somebody
with
his
own
choosing
in
under
what
condition?
justice
potter
stewart
as
contrasted
with
an
investigative
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
gather
that
mr.
jenkins
your
submission
is
that
they
can
never
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
refusal
to
permit
when
the
employer
wants
an
interview
with
an
employee
and
the
employee
to
have
union
aids
(inaudible)
with?
i
mean,
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
then
no
circumstances
under
which
unless
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provides?
justice
potter
stewart
never
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
never
of
any
decision
of
this
court
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
i
do
not
what
i
thought
and
i
want
to
be
clear
that
i
understand
that
you're
not
arguing
upholding
this
distinction
that
the
board
has
made,
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
in
the
absence
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
providing
otherwise
is
absolutely
no
right
of
representation
if
an
employee
for
an
interview
with
the
employer
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
if
the
right
attaches
only
under
a
different
provision
of
the
act
if
that
is
when
there's
a
grievance?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
on
grievance,
i
mean
if
there's
or
when
there
has
been
some
sort
of
disciplinary
action?
justice
potter
stewart
afterwards
then?
