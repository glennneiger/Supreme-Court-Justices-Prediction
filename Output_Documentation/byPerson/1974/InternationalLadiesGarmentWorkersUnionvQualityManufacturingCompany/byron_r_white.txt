justice

white
that
issue
is
not
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
you
just
to
help
me
a
little
bit.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
all
sounds
to
me
like
where
there's
reasonable
belief
as
in
this
brings
as
right
back
under
subjective
criteria
measurement,
doesn't
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
dunau,
would
you
go
so
far
as
to
impose
on
the
employer
duty
to
inform
the
employee
of
her
right
to
representation?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
a
matter
often
covered
in
collective
bargaining
agreements
supposed
to
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
--
do
you
agree
that
the
origin
is
not
in
the
duty
to
bargain
or
is
it
in
the
right
to
collective
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes.
i
just
want
to
ask
you
then
what
about
it
when
there's
no
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
she
could
request
somebody
else
besides
if
there
is
a
bargaining
agent
could
request
somebody
else
beside
the
bargaining
agent
to
go
with
her.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
if
we
can
wait
some,
we
might
wait
some
--
if
we
happen
to
agree
with
you
in
this
case
we
might
get
another
one
then
as
to
what's
the
employer
suppose
to
do
when
the
union
wants
to
be
there
but
the
employee
wants
somebody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
i
think
that
also
means
maybe
something
that
isn't
in
the
bargaining
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
might
try
this
on
other
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
like
that
it
hasn't
happen
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
risk
is
that
it
might
be
found
that
he's
fired
because
he
refuses
interview.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
jenkins,
getting
back
to
your
--
the
dichotomy
i
think
you
suggested
between
a
stage
of
investigation
and
the
stage
which
discipline
is
possible.
for
example,
suppose
of
theft
in
the
plan
and
the
employer
decides
he
wants
to
talk
to
everybody
and
calls
them
up
one
by
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
gather
that
for
you
would
be
the
investigation
stage
and
one
would
not
be
entitle
have
the
fellow
employee
with
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
is
the
line,
where
is
the
cross
the
line
so
that
the
employee
is
entitled
to
have
some
assistance?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
satisfied
with
the
--
would
you
be
satisfied
with
the
rule
that
the
employee
may
have
disciplinary
or
may
have
a
help
within
if
it's
disciplinary?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
would
turn
on
what
the
employer
anticipate
in
doing?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
was
the
rule
for
a
long
time,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
that
the
rule
for
quite
a
while
if
discipline
is
involved,
you're
entitled
to
representation?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board
is
not
part
on
that
let's
say
when
a
discipline
is
involved
or
not
even
though
it's
investigatory
he's
entitled
to
representation.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
go
as
far
as
you're
suggesting,
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course
they
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
or
did
they,
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
gather
you
think
that
denial
is
something
you
can
support
without
cross-petition?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i
gather
mr.
jenkins
essentially,
your
submission
is
that
concerted
section
7
--
this
is
not
a
concerted
activity
within
section
7?
