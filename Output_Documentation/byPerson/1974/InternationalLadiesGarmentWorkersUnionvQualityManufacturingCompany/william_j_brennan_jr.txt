justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
last
two
cases
are
73-765,
international
garment
workers
v.
quality
manufacturing
co.
and
73-1363,
national
labor
relations
board
v.
weingarten.
the
first
on
cert
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
second
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
they
are
companion
cases
presenting
the
same
question
namely,
whether
an
employer
commits
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
refusing
an
employee's
request
that
the
employee
be
accompanied
by
a
union
representative
at
an
interview
with
the
employer
that
the
employee
reasonably
believes
may
result
in
disciplinary
action.
in
quality,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
and
in
weingarten,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
employer
did
not
commit
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
such
cases.
we
disagree
and
reverse
the
judgment
of
each
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
it
was
within
the
competence
of
the
board
to
find
that
although
some
earlier
board
precedence
may
be
read
as
reaching
a
contrary
conclusion,
the
board's
accumulating
experience
with
the
problems
justified
its
holding
that
the
employer's
refusal
constituted
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
as
an
interference
with
the
right
of
the
employee
protected
by
section
7
to
engage
in
concerted
activities
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
the
chief
justice
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
also
dissents
and
joined
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
