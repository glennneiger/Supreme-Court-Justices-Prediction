justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
do
i
understand
mr.
jenkins
that
your
submission
would
be
take
this
theft
case
again.
when
the
employer
after
an
interview
with
no
representative
or
assistant
present
concludes
that
this
is
the
thief,
he
may
then
without
committing
on
unfairly
with
practice
in
that
situation
discharged
the
employee
then
in
there
and
leave
the
employee
to
the
remedy
of
a
grievance
and
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
calls
for
an
arbitration,
is
that
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
then
i
take
it
you
would
contest
that
would
you
to
a
situation
where
he
begins
the
employer
does
whether
a
suspicion
that's
more
than
suspicion
that
this
is
the
thief.
and
in
that
circumstance
it
would
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
the
employee
insisted
on
having
assistance
of
another
fellow
employee
and
he
refuse
to
allow
the
assistance.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
what
would
you
do
in
a
situation
where
he
started
out
with
the
suspicion
that
this
was
the
--
and
the
employee
wanted
someone
with
him
at
the
interview?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
sure
you
argued
it?
