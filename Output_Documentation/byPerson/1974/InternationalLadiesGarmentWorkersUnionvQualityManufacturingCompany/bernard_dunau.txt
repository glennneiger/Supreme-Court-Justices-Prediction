mr.
bernard
dunau
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
of
this
case
presents
is
whether
an
employer
may
coerce
and
an
employee
to
participate
in
an
interview
with
that
employer
unaided
by
a
union
representative
where
the
outcome
of
the
interview
is
reasonably
believed
by
the
employee
to
subject
him
to
the
risk
of
disciplinary
action.
more
specifically
in
terms
of
this
case,
an
employee
is
called
in
to
talk
to
the
employer
and
the
board
finds
that
the
employee
reasonably
fears
disciplinary
action
may
that
employer
fire
the
employee
because
she
refuses
to
submit
to
a
private
interview?
may
that
employer
fire
the
two
employee
representatives
or
fellow
employees
who
are
the
shop
ladies
in
the
shop
because
they
seek
to
provide
the
representation
requested
of
them.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
correct
sir.
well,
i
should
say
the
trial
examiner
did
find
that
the
agreement
was
not
silent
on
the
subject.
the
trial
examiner
construed
the
agreement
to
mean
that
by
agreement,
the
employer
was
required
to
confer
the
representation
in
this
instance.
we
don't
think
that's
determinative
but
if
the
agreement
were
silent
or
if
the
agreement
certainly
is
as
construed
here
that
is
the
question
that
is
presented.
we
don't
have
in
other
words
an
agreement
which
bars
union
representation.
mr.
bernard
dunau
our
claim
is
that
the
statute
confers
the
right.
yes
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
our
position
is
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
no
it
wouldn't
even
go
beyond
that
because
our
view
would
be
that
concerted
activity
for
a
mutual
aid
or
protection
would
exist
even
they
--
though
there
were
no
union
in
the
picture.
suppose
for
example
an
employee
is
called
in
to
a
private
interview
in
which
he
reasonably
fears
subjection
to
discipline
because
she
fears
if
she
asked
let's
say
fellow
employee
to
come
along
with
her.
in
our
view,
that
is
concerted
activity
when
that
fellow
employee
is
willing
to
furnish
the
aid.
she
expects
or
she
can
surely
be
expected
to
suppose
that
when
her
turn
comes
she
will
be
helped
so
that
even
in
a
non-union
situation,
helping
the
other
employee
is
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
mr.
bernard
dunau
but
it
is
not
an
employment
at
will
in
the
sense
that
when
an
employee
is
exercising
a
statutory
right
that
that
employee
may
be
fired
for
exercising
that
right
and
that
statutory
right
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
one
employee
asked
again
another
to
assist
him
in
meeting
with
the
employer
as
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
bernard
dunau
before
the
board.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
i'm
arguing
the
harter
case
because
that
is
not
the
case
we
have
here.
we
have
a
case
here
of
union
representation.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir.
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
and
even
under
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
unless
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provides
for
compensation
for
the
steward
in
the
conduct
of
union
business.
there
are
such
agreements.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
that
may
not
be
at
his
option.
the
employer
may
be
required
if
he
doesn't
want
the
fellow
employee
to
do
it
during
union
hours
or
during
working
hours
to
say,
“okay,
do
it
after
working
hours.”
but
it
is
not
a
privilege
in
the
employer
to
refuse
to
meet
or
to
compel
a
meeting
with
an
employee
without
assistance
of
the
union
--
without
the
assistance
of
a
fellow
employee
if
that
is
requested.
i
think
the
facts
if
they
are
stated
should
focus
this
issue
rather
sharply.
on
the
employer
side,
we
have
three
people;
a
lawrence
gerlach
who
was
the
president
of
the
company,
his
wife
kathryn
gerlach
who
was
the
production
manager,
their
son
lawrence
gerlach
who's
the
general
manager
--
junior,
yes
sir.
there's
a
certified
bargaining
representative,
certified
to
represent
the
production
employees.
on
the
union
side
with
respect
to
day
to
day
problems
which
arise
there
is
a
shop
chairlady
called
delila
mulford,
there
is
an
assistant
shop
chairlady
called
martha
cochran,
they
were
elected
to
their
posts.
and
then
there
is
a
long
time
employee
a
catherine
king
about
whom
these
events
center.
on
friday
october
10,
1969,
the
three
gerlachs,
the
shop
chairlady,
catherine
king
and
two
other
employees
meet.
the
employees
are
complaining
about
the
wage
rate.
they
say
they
can't
make
a
decent
wage
under
the
piecework
system
in
effect.
the
meeting
ends
on
an
acrimonious
exchange.
the
gerlach
say
“if
you
don't
like
it
here,
go
elsewhere.”
that
later
that
same
afternoon,
catherine
king
shuts
down
her
machine.
she
starts
gesturing
with
her
hands.
she
causes
a
minor
disturbance.
mrs.
gerlach
tells
hers
resume
production.
catherine
king
tells
her,
“mind
your
own
business.”
at
that
point,
mrs.
gerlach
says
to
king,
“go
down
and
see
the
president
mr.
gerlach.”
she
goes
but
on
the
way
she
asks
the
shop
chairlady
to
accompany
her
to
assist
her
at
this
meeting
with
the
president.
when
they
get
there,
the
gerlachs
object
to
the
presence
of
the
shop
chairlady
and
she
responds,
“catherine
paid
her
dues
and
she's
entitled
to
have
me
be
there.”
since
catherine
refused
to
submit
to
the
interview
without
the
presence
of
the
shop
chairlady
and
since
the
gerlachs
refused
to
have
her
there,
they
were
both
sent
back
to
their
work
stations.
the
first
blow
fell
on
sunday,
october
12.
mulford
is
called
on
the
telephone,
she's
told
she
is
suspended
for
two
days
and
the
reason
is
that
she
attempted
to
represent
catherine
king.
the
next
day,
monday
october
13th,
again,
king
is
called
to
the
office.
this
time
she
asked
the
assistant
shop
chairlady,
martha
cochran.
now,
martha
cochran
to
which
accompany
her.
marta
cochran's
presence
is
subjected
too.
cochran
asks,
“what
do
you
want
to
speak
to
king
about?”
she
is
told,
“we
want
to
take
off
where
we
left
off
on
friday”
to
which
cochran
responds
well,
“i'm
sorry,
but
if
that's
what
you
want
to
talk
to
her
about
that
is
union
business
and
she
has
asked
me
to
represent
her.
i
am
a
union
steward
and
that's
my
duty.”
again,
gerlach
was
refused
permission
to
return
to
work
because
she
refused
to
submit
to
a
private
interview.
cochran's
timecard
was
pulled
from
the
rack.
the
next
day,
tuesday,
october
14th,
cochran
is
now
suspended
for
two
days
for
seeking
to
represent
king.
and
king
is
not
allowed
to
return
to
work
because
she
refuses
to
submit
to
an
interview
without
the
presence
of
her
union
representative.
wednesday,
october
15th,
mulford's
two
days
suspension
is
at
an
end.
the
three
of
them
go
to
the
gerlachs.
cochran
is
told
she
can't
return
to
work
because
she
has
got
one
more
day
suspension.
king
is
told
she
can't
return
to
work
unless
she
submits
to
a
private
interview.
mulford
is
allowed
to
return
to
work
but
she's
admonished
to
mind
her
own
business.
and
she
responds,
“i
was
minding
my
own
business.”
catherine
had
a
right
to
representation
as
well
as
anybody
else.
and
the
events
culminate
on
october
16th.
cochran
suspension
is
now
at
an
end.
all
three
go
to
seek
gerlach.
cochran
gets
her
timecard.
she's
allowed
to
return
to
work.
king
is
told
submit
to
a
private
interview.
she
asked
with
delila
mulford,
the
shop
chairlady.
she
is
told,
“no,
not
with
delila.”
she
is
also
told
that,
“if
you
walk
out
that
door
if
you
again
refuse
to
submit
a
private
interview,
you're
finished.”
she
walked
out
the
door,
she
was
finished.
mulford
asks,
“what
about
me?”
she
is
told,
“you're
finished
too.”
that's
two
of
them.
cochran
has
left
but
not
for
a
very
long
time.
that
day,
she
submits
or
tries
to
submit
written
grievances
to
gerlach,
jr.
the
written
grievances
complaining
of
king's
discharge,
her
suspension
for
two
days,
cochran's
--
mulford
suspension
for
two
days,
and
her
discharge.
gerlach,
jr.
says,
“i've
got
no
time
to
full
with
them
damn
things.
i'm
going
out
to
town.”
she
puts
the
grievance
on
the
desk.
he
picks
it
up
and
throws
it
in
the
trash
basket.
though
jr.
or
gerlach,
jr.
takes
her
timecard
from
the
rack,
he
tells
that
“you
work
this
aftern
--
this
morning
but
you're
going
to
work
this
afternoon.”
she
then
goes
to
mr.
gerlach,
sr.
she
asks
“are
you
fired
--
am
i'm
fired?”
and
she's
told,
“you
wanted
to
draw
unemployment
compensation,
go
draw
it?”
and
that's
the
end
of
the
third
question.
now,
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
on
agreement
as
to
one
matter.
the
board
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
cochran's
filing
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
she
had
presented
a
grievance.
the
acts
fell
after
she
presented
a
grievance
that
was
protected
union
activity
and
her
reinstatement
with
back
pay
is
required.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
issue
is
not
here
your
honor.
there
is
no
cross-petition.
the
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
disagree
as
to
the
mulford
and
as
to
king
and
as
to
cochran's
suspension
for
the
two
days
preceding
her
discharge.
and
as
to
that
the
board
finds
cochran
--
i'm
sorry,
king
reasonably
fear
that
she
would
be
subjected
to
disciplinary
action
in
the
event
or
as
a
result
of
the
outcome
of
this
interview.
since
she
reasonably
feared
subjection
to
disciplinary
action
the
employer
had
two
alternatives.
if
the
employer
wanted
to
talk
to
her,
she
was
entitled
the
employee
to
have
the
union
representative
there
at
her
request.
the
employer
if
he
didn't
want
to
talk
with
her
with
the
union
representative
present
was
free
not
to
have
the
interview
at
all.
but
the
employer
could
not
have
it
both
ways.
he
could
not
have
both
an
interview
with
the
employee
and
effacement
of
the
union
representative.
in
the
board's
view
and
we
can
summarize
it
in
the
two
sentences
it
wrote
in
the
later
case.
it
is
a
serious
violation
of
the
employees'
individual
right
to
engage
in
concerted
activity
by
seeking
the
assistance
of
his
statutory
representative
if
the
employer
denies
the
employee's
request
and
compels
the
employee
to
appear
unassisted
at
an
interview
which
may
put
his
job
security
in
jeopardy
such
as
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
i
don't
believe
it
does
unless
we
are
to
say
every
time
we
have
a
standard
which
says,
“we
will
determine
what
has
done
by
reference
to
what
a
reasonable
man
in
the
circumstances
would
do
if
that
is
subjective
then
it
is
subjective.
we
do
as
we
do
in
many
other
fields
we
say,
“action
may
be
taken
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
belief
if
that
is
subjective,
then
we
are
subjective.”
but
if
as
we
had
supposed
the
very
notion
of
reasonable
belief
is
that
it
is
not
subjectivity
that
controls
that
should
determine
reasonable
belief
by
observation
of
external
circumstances
and
what
based
on
those
external
circumstances
one
can
reasonably
infer,
then
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
there
is
any
subjectivity
to
the
standard
which
the
board
has
adopted.
and
as
to
that
standard,
if
i
may
continue
that
with
respect
to
it,
we
have
had
experience,
there
have
been
board
cases
in
this
case,
there
was
no
question
and
could
be
no
question
about
the
employee's
reasonable
basis
for
fear.
in
the
next
case,
there
surely
could
be
no
question
that
the
employee
reasonably
feared
loss
of
her
job.
in
the
case
which
the
seventh
circuit
decided
a
case
of
alleged
theft,
there
was
again
no
question
of
reasonable
belief.
when
these
things
occurred
under
collective
bargaining
agreements,
when
they
occur
when
arbitrators
interpret
collective
bargaining
agreements,
when
they
occur
as
a
matter
of
everyday
routine
in
many
plans;
the
obstacle
is
not
any
concern
that
the
employee
has
no
reasonable
belief.
mr.
bernard
dunau
had
she
done
anything?
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
basis
for
a
reasonable
belief
sir,
i
think
that
the
illustrated
like
what
mrs.
gerlach
testified
too
at
the
hearing
at
page
79.
mr.
bernard
dunau
of
the
single
appendix,
your
honor.
on
cross-examination
talking
about
mr.
gerlach,
sr.
mr.
bernard
dunau
page
79
sir.
“you
wanted
him
to
correct
her,
didn't
you?
no
sir,
i
wanted
to
take
her
down
because
she
sassed
me.
you
wanted
your
husband
to
correct
king
for
this
sassing?
yes!”
now,
i
don't
see
how
it
can
be
said
when
mrs.
gerlach
says
she
want
to
have
king
corrected
for
sassing
that
at
least
there
is
not
a
reasonable
basis
for
apprehension
that
she
will
be
reprimanded
or
suspended
or
indeed
perhaps
discharged.
we
know
this
employer
was
fast
on
the
trigger.
he
did
in
fact
suspend
two
people
and
he
did
discharge
two
people.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
would
depend
upon
what
an
arbitrator
would
be
determined
when
the
case
was
presented
to
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
there
shall
be
no
suspension
or
discharge
without
just
cause.
the
question
for
the
arbitrator
would
then
become
is
it
just
cause
to
suspend
or
discharge
this
employee
because
she
sassed
her
boss.
i
think
i
know
what
my
answer
would
be
but
i
don't
know
what
a
particular
arbitrator's
answer
would
be
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
bernard
dunau
or
what
junior's
answer
might
have
been,
yes.
but
it
is
certainly
clear
and
when
she
is
asked
to
go
to
the
boss'
office
following
an
altercation
with
the
boss'
wife
that
an
employee
has
reasonable
grounds
to
fear
the
imposition
of
discipline.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no
sir,
we
do
not
take
that
position.
if
the
right
exists
by
statute,
the
unions
will
be
sure
to
inform
their
employees
of
what
their
rights
are.
we
do
not
expect
the
employer
to
inform
the
employee
of
his
rights.
mr.
bernard
dunau
it
is
covered
in
collective
bargaining
agreements.
i'm
unprepared
to
say
the
incidents
of
the
coverage.
it's
covered
in
major
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it's
in
the
steelworker's
agreement,
i
believe
in
goodyear,
i
believe
in
auto,
i
have
seen
it
in
other
agreements
but
i
have
no
basis
for
saying
the
incidents
of
it.
mr.
bernard
dunau
the
origin
of
the
duty
as
it
exist
and
found
in
this
case
is
section
7
and
not
section
8
(a)
(5).
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
i
had
my
druthers
it
would
be
both,
your
honor.
it
would
section
7
and
section
8
(a)(5)
but
saying
it
is
not
section
8
(a)(5)
does
not
compel
the
conclusion
is
not
also
section
7.
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
it
were
an
8(a)(5)
then
there
would
be
no
right
in
the
employee
because
there'd
be
no
bargaining
representative
since
i
placed
it
or
the
board
places
it
in
section
7,
the
bargaining
representative's
presence
is
a
matter
of
indifference
because
an
employee
when
she
seeks
the
help
of
her
fellow
employees
to
engage
in
concerted
activity.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
depends
on
the
reading
of
proviso.
on
my
reading
of
a
proviso
yes
but
there
is
rather
respectable
authority
the

mr.

the
proviso
of
section
9
(a)
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
if
there
is
a
bargaining
representative
and
that
happens
we're
going
to
have
i'm
afraid
one
grand
hassle
as
to
what
the
proviso
to
section
9
(a)
means.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
if
it's
settled
in
the
bargaining
--
well,
that's
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
we
may
try
to
settle
in
the
bargaining
agreement
but
if
there's
a
statutory
right
in
the
employee
under
the
proviso
it
doesn't
matter
what
we
put
in
the
agreement.
we
can't
make
an
agreement
which
abrogates
what
the
employee
is
entitled
to(voice
overlap).
mr.
bernard
dunau
section
7
gives
the
right
we
are
asserting,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
the
language
we're
relying
on
but
i
would
have
to
say
in
candor,
if
there
were
a
bargaining
representative
and
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
i
think
we
would
be
required
to
mesh
that
general
language
of
what
the
meaning
of
the
proviso
is
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
very
easy
question.
mr.
bernard
dunau
after
a
grievance
is
filed
as
i
recall
the
law
generally
in
this
area,
the
board
says
and
the
courts
have
agreed,
“you
cannot
have
a
rival
union
present
the
grievance.”
i
don't
believe
they
have
said
that
you
cannot
have
an
experience
fellow
employee
in
to
help
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
--
or
inexperience
someone
that
you
trust
that
would
like
to
have
with
you.
mr.
bernard
dunau
thank
you.
[lunch
recess]
mr.
bernard
dunau
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
justice
rehnquist
asked
about
whether
any
employee
who
was
asked
to
represent
another
may
just
walk
off
the
floor
at
his
wish.
there
is
a
particular
finding
of
fact
in
this
case
which
disposes
of
this
problem
at
least
for
this
case.
turning
to
and
this
is
on
page
8
(a)
of
our
petition
--
the
white.
turning
next
to
the
company
suspensions
of
mulford
and
cochran,
the
company
claims
that
both
employees
were
suspended
for
being
away
from
their
machines
without
permission.
the
trial
examiner
finds
this
reason
was
protectoral.
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
and
we
adopt
this
finding.
in
particular,
we
note
that
mrs.
gerlach
testified
that
union
chairlady
had
left
the
floor
in
the
past
on
union
business
without
being
disciplined.
it
follows
that
to
despair
a
treatment
here
was
motivated
by
the
company's
desire
to
punish
mulford
and
cochran
for
performing
their
duties
as
union
chairladies
in
seeking
to
represent
king
at
the
conference
that
the
company
requested.
we
have
taken
the
position
that
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
section
7
and
that
it
is
irrelevant
to
this
case
that
there
may
be
no
cantonment
section
8
(a)(5)
bargaining
obligation.
we
think
we
can
illustrate
it
by
a
case
that
this
court
has
already
decided
one
called
washington
aluminum
where
a
group
of
workers
and
protest
against
the
lack
of
heat
in
the
plant
walked
out
as
a
body.
they
were
discharged
that
discharge
was
held
to
the
unfair
labor
practice
because
these
employees
were
engaging
in
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
yet
those
same
employees
did
not
and
could
not
have
the
advantages
of
bargaining
because
they
had
no
bargaining
representative
and
precisely
here
as
in
that
case,
the
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection
existing,
the
employees
were
free
or
should
be
free
of
reprisal
for
that
conduct
whether
or
not
the
employer
had
an
additional
obligation
to
bargain
with
the
union
representative.
in
this
case,
we
think
that
union
representation
is
surely
at
the
essence
of
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection.
employees
joined
unions
for
the
precise
purpose
of
pulling
their
strength
and
dealing
with
their
employer
on
equality.
in
this
case,
the
employees
pulled
their
strength.
they
elected
one
of
their
number
to
represent
them.
when
that
person
elected
by
the
others
to
represent
them
seeks
to
provide
the
representation
which
the
employee
asks
it
is
concerted
activity
for
mutual
aid
or
protection
in
the
most
simplistic
sense
of
that
term.
that
view
is
also
consonant
with
what
the
section
7
is
all
about.
it
is
all
about
eliminating
individual
helplessness
in
dealing
with
any
employer
and
it
is
especially
manifest
in
this
kind
of
situation
when
an
employee
is
asked
to
confront
his
employer
in
a
situation
where
the
risk
of
discipline
exists
that
employee
is
in
a
precarious
position.
that
employee
may
be
in
experienced,
he
may
be
ignorant,
he
may
be
frightened,
he
may
not
have
--
be
unable
to
express
himself.
those
disadvantages
are
overcome
by
having
a
union
representative
at
the
interview
so
that
he
is
not
exposed
to
unmerited
discipline
because
he
is
scared,
is
frightened,
is
inarticulate.
mr.
bernard
dunau
no,
sir,
we
have
not
--
the
reason
we
have
not
is
that
in
this
case
that
no
conflict
arises
between
what
the
representative
wants
done
and
what
the
individual
employee
wants
done.
now,
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
ordinarily,
at
the
first
step
of
the
grievance
procedure
under
a
union
contract,
the
employee
is
given
the
option
either
to
present
the
grievance
to
the
foreman
on
its
own
or
to
have
the
union
representative
with
them
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i'm
sorry,
the
employee
is
given
the
option
either
to
go
it
alone
if
that's
what
it
wants
or
to
have
his
union
steward
if
that's
what
he
wants.
now,
i
did
mention
something
about
an
experienced
friend
or
inexperienced
friend
accompanying
the
employee.
and
what
i
had
in
mind
was
this
decision
used
to
a
company
versus
the
labor
board
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
147
f.2d
69
which
was
a
pre
taft-hartley
decision
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
rival
union
could
not
represent
the
employee
but
it
went
on
to
say,
“we
think
an
inexperienced
or
ignorant
griever
can
ask
a
more
experienced
friend
to
assist
them,
but
he
cannot
present
his
grievance
through
any
union
except
the
representative.”
on
the
other
hand,
the
representative
were
not
asked
to
present
a
grievance
but
it's
attending
to
safeguard
the
collective
bargaining
cannot
exclude
the
griever
and
withdraw
his
grievance
or
destroy
it
by
not
permitting
its
consideration.
now,
the
extent
to
which
the
proviso
is
cut
into
what
would
otherwise
be
the
exclusive
authority
of
the
representative
is
an
extraordinarily
difficult
and
in
my
view
still
unresolved
problem
but
we
don't
have
it
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
we
have
consonants
between
what
the
employee
wants.
he
wants
representation
by
his
union
steward
that's
what
he
is
entitled
to,
that's
what
was
foreclosed
to
him
by
the
employer
statutes.
mr.
bernard
dunau
well,
if
the
firing
is
because
he
refuses
to
talk
without
the
present
of
the
representative
that
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
that
is
this
case.
mr.
bernard
dunau
because
then
the
discharge
is
not
because
the
employee
refuses
to
submit
to
a
private
interview.
the
discharge
is
because
the
guy
was
negligent
or
otherwise
inefficient.
if
that
is
the
reason
for
the
discharge,
the
only
recourse
the
employee
has
is
under
his
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
present
the
question
to
an
arbitrator
to
determine
whether
just
cause
for
discharge
existed.
it
is
not
at
that
point
of
labor
board
question.
mr.
bernard
dunau
so
long
as
at
the
same
time
he
terminates
the
interview.
he
can't
have
it
both
ways.
if
he
wants
the
interview
and
the
employee
request
it,
the
union
steward
must
be
allowed
to
participate
in
the
interview.
mr.
bernard
dunau
yes,
i
did
answer
that
way
and
that's
precisely
illustrated
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
let
me
see
if
i
can
illustrate
it
by
the
--
mr.
bernard
dunau
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
bernard
dunau
in
this
case,
that
was
the
finding
that
was
the
evidence
that
the
discharge
was
because
you
refuse
to
submit
to
a
private
interview.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that
is
precisely
the
situation
that
was
presented
to
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
mobil
case
where
the
employer
refused
to
grant
the
individual's
request
to
be
represented
by
a
steward.
but
the
employees
were
then
discharged
for
theft.
the
board
found
that
the
discharge
is
for
theft,
were
real
that
they
were
not
a
pretext
to
discharge
these
employees
for
refusing
to
submit
to
a
private
interview.
and
therefore,
the
order
in
that
case
was
to
the
employer
cease
and
desist
from
insisting
on
a
private
interview
when
the
employee
requests
representation
but
since
the
discharge
was
not
for
that
reason
but
for
alleged
theft
that
question
was
for
the
arbitrator.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
dunau
that's
the
alternative.
mr.
bernard
dunau
thank
you
sir.
