it
never
--
it
never
or
my
mistake,
it
has
--has
it
ever
been
explicitly
accepted
by
this
court?
justice

stewart
borak
draw
something
else,
did
it?
the
borak
case?
justice
potter
stewart
if
i'm
not
mistaken
that
was
not
a
final
judgment
that
not
that
that
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
into
the
court
but
it
might
have,
i
mean,
in
other
words,
the
defendants
might
still
have
prevailed
in
that
case
if
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
i
remember
correctly.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
it
on
the
previous
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
seventh
circuit
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
done
it
--
done
it
another
case
and
we
have
the
benefit
of
their
thinking
on
the
other
side.
justice
potter
stewart
all
things
in
canvas
in
the
courts
of
appeals
including
this
one.

justice
potter
stewart
you
have
a
litigation
pending
in
the
state
courts
haven
you
on
this
same
basic
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
you
had
too?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
stated,
the
way
you
just
stated
that
broadly
and
that
would
mean
and
i
guess
you're
going
to
argue
that
the
broad
issue
that
mr.
kreps
submitted
to
us
is
here.
justice
potter
stewart
and
presented
by
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
say
that
if
you
don't
believe
in
a
rule,
well
then
you
think
any
exception
to
it
is
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
square
conflict
in
the
circuits?
justice
potter
stewart
probably
i
don't
get
it
because
the
seventh
circuit
has
explicitly
declined
to
follow
the
birnbaum
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
and
whether
this
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
can
be
said
to
have
done
more
less
the
same
thing,
in
fact
or
not
done
it
is
rather
unimportant
because
other
courts
of
appeals
have
said
we
do
follow
the
birnbaum
rule.
