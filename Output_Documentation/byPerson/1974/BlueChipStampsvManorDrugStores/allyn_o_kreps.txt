mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
important
practical
question
before
this
court
is
whether
every
security
issue
subject
to
the
security
laws
will
be
the
basis
for
a
federal
claim
for
damages
by
any
person
whenever
the
issue
price
or
current
market
price
is
followed
by
a
price
rise
or
more
directly
whether
any
non
purchaser,
non
seller
or
potential
investor
will
have
a
private
federal
claim
to
speculate
on
the
market
without
cost
or
risk
of
loss
and
at
the
expense
of
actual
and
existing
investors
and
to
the
burden
of
the
federal
judiciary.
this
statement
may
seem
extreme
and
certainly
simplistic
but
it
is
the
inevitable
practical
result
of
the
extreme
and
simplistic
position
taken
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
this
case
by
calling
for
the
complete
judicial
abandonment
of
the
purchaser-seller
rule
commonly
known
as
the
birnbaum
doctrine.
the
fundamental
legal
issue
before
this
court
upon
which
this
practical
problem
is
bottomed
is
to
determine
what
class
of
persons
should
be
permitted
to
bring
a
judicially
implied
private
right
of
action
for
damages
under
rule
10b-5
as
promulgated
by
the
sec
to
enforce
the
prohibitions
of
section
10
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
although
no
private
right
of
action
is
set
forth
expressly
in
either
section
10
(b)
by
congress
or
rule
10b-5
of
the
sec,
the
lower
courts
have
implied
such
a
right
of
action
for
purchasers
or
sellers
since
the
kardon
case
in
1946
and
the
fischman
case
in
1951.
this
honorable
court
has
recognized
this
implied
right
of
action
for
damages
inter
alia
in
both
bankers
life
and
affiliated
ute,
although
the
existence
of
the
right
of
action
in
the
plaintiffs
there
involved
or
the
plaintiff's
standing
in
the
non-constitutional
sense
was
not
questioned
or
an
issue
in
those
cases.
the
standing
of
the
plaintiff-respondent
here
is
in
question
precisely
because
it
has
never
owned,
never
purchased
or
never
sold
the
securities
upon
which
it
purports
to
base
its
alleged
private
claim
for
damages
under
rule
10b-5.
now,
petitioners
concede
that
a
violation
of
rule
10b-5
in
connection
with
the
issuance
of
these
securities
has
been
alleged
in
the
amended
complaint
but
petitioners
contend
that
as
a
matter
or
law,
plaintiff-respondent
has
no
judicially
implied
private
right
of
action
for
damages
arising
from
the
issuance
of
these
securities
precisely
because
any
such
alleged
damage
was
not
incurred
by
the
respondent
in
connection
with
either
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security
by
it.
there
being
no
better
point
of
departure
in
determining
the
merits
of
this
contention
than
rule
10b-5
itself.
it
should
be
observed
that
the
express
prohibitions
of
10b-5
are
applicable
“in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
any
security.”
in
the
birnbaum
case,
the
second
circuit
concluded
that
the
rule
10b-5
did
not
create
an
implied
private
right
of
action
for
non-purchasers
or
non-sellers
or
potential
investors
but
only
for
the
defrauded
purchaser
or
seller.
in
subsequent
cases,
the
lower
courts
have
recognized
the
salutary
regulatory
purpose
of
rule
10b-5
and
have
applied
a
liberal
definition
to
the
words
purchase
or
sale
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
for
damages
in
the
so-called
for
seller
situation
without
requiring
a
formal
consummated
transaction
and
the
lower
courts
also
have
recognized
that
the
1934
act
expressly
defines
sale
or
purchase
to
include
contracts
for
which
consideration
has
been
given
to
sell
or
purchase
and
have
recognized
an
implied
right
of
action
for
damages
under
10b-5
in
such
situations.
that
is
not
the
case
here
because
there
was
no
legally
enforceable
obligation
to
buy
or
to
sell
and
no
contractual
relationship
existed
between
respondent
and
petitioners
or
any
of
them.
although
the
birnbaum
rule
has
been
the
subject
of
some
academic
criticism,
this
judicially
developed
doctrine
has
resulted
in
a
rational
and
predictable
framework
for
vindication
of
the
policies
underlying
rule
10b-5.
even
while
the
sec
urges
the
abandonment
of
the
purchaser-seller
rule,
it
now
for
the
first
time
after
many
years
recognizes
or
admits
to
the
practical
detrimental
consequences
of
increase
liability
exposure,
strike
suits,
news
and
settlement
and
an
impossible
standard
of
draftsmanship
imposed
upon
the
draftsman
of
the
prospectus
if
the
purchaser-seller
rule
is
not
retained.
nonetheless,
the
sec
advocates
that
the
rule
be
abandoned
so
that
any
person
making
an
investment
decision
even
when
not
to
buy,
not
to
do
anything
has
a
private
right
of
action
under
10b-5,
and
so
proposing
this
subjective
standard
for
standing,
even
the
sec
attempts
to
ameliorate
the
recognize
detrimental
consequences
upon
all
issuers
of
stock
and
their
existing
shareholders
by
suggesting
two
limitations
but
each
limitation
is
illusory
and
ineffective.
the
sec
proposes
first
an
enhanced
burden
of
proof
upon
plaintiff,
potential
investors
and
non-purchasers
who
claimed
they
would
have
bought
or
sold
but
for
the
alleged
10b-5
violation.
whatever
slight
burden
this
may
place
on
the
scale
pleaders
in
drafting
complaints,
it
is
clear
that
it
does
not
provide
any
means
of
permitting
summary
disposition
of
cases
before
trial.
any
recipient
of
a
prospectus,
anyone
with
notice
of
a
stock
issue
or
a
recipient
of
a
press
release
as
in
texas
gulf
sulphur
could
subsequently
bring
a
claim
as
to
any
stock
having
a
post
issue
or
market
price
rise
by
simply
alleging
receipt
of
the
allegedly
defective
prospectus
or
the
press
release
the
fact
of
subsequent
price
increase
and
the
obvious
conclusion
that
he
would
have
bought
at
the
issue
price
or
then
market
price
if
he
had
been
informed
correctly
that
the
stock
was
a
bargain
or
would
increase
in
value.
hindsight
will
invariably
disclose
some
statement
in
a
prospectus
that
appears
to
be
either
overemphasized
as
alleged
here
or
underemphasized
in
the
light
of
a
subsequent
price
rise.
in
this
case,
respondent
watched
the
market
price
rise
for
over
two
years
before
filing
the
instant
lawsuit.
in
the
face
of
the
expressed
statutory
mandate
of
the
1933
act
and
as
reflected
by
rules
and
policies
of
the
sec,
that
all
prospectuses
embody
a
conservative
philosophy.
it
is
apparent
that
such
factual
situations
of
price
rise
will
occur
not
infrequently
but
the
sec
offers
the
issuer
no
rational
means
of
complying
with
the
conservative
disclosure
standards
of
the
1933
act
and
yet
avoiding
the
inevitable
line
of
potential
investor
claimants
at
the
federal
court
house.
the
second
limitation
by
the
sec
is
to
impose
vicarious
liability
upon
the
corporation
only
when
it
benefits
from
the
alleged
violation
of
rule
10b-5
by
its
officers.
presumably,
this
limitation
is
a
recognition
by
the
sec
that
the
purposes
of
the
securities
laws
are
not
served
by
forcing
corporation
--
corporations
to
pay
potential
investors
and
non-purchasers
from
proceeds
derived
from
actual
purchasers
and
actual
investors.
this
second
limitation
is
also
illusory
since
motive
is
not
an
element
of
a
10b-5
claim
and
section
20
(a)
of
the
1934
act
expressly
imposes
such
vicarious
liability
upon
the
corporation
for
such
acts.
thus,
however
meritorious,
such
a
limitation
on
vicarious
liability
might
be,
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
impose
it
and
accordingly,
judicial
imposition
would
be
inappropriate.
but
more
fundamentally,
the
position
of
the
sec
totally
ignores
the
problem
of
what
the
substantive
elements
of
a
private
claim
by
non-purchasers
and
potential
investors
would
be.
for
example,
how
many
potential
investors
and
non-purchasers
can
sue
if
one
million
shares
are
issued
and
so
the
$10.00
per
share
or
$10
million
to
1,000
persons,
can
everyone
sue
who
received
a
prospectus
or
had
knowledge
of
the
issue
but
decided
not
to
invest.
if
a
thousand
additional
potential
investors
did
so,
10,000
and
so
on.
at
least
under
the
present
rule,
the
liability
is
limited
to
those
one
million
shares,
the
money
damages
to
a
maximum
of
$10
million
since
that
was
the
total
price
received
and
the
suit
is
limited
to
purchasers,
only
they
would
be
able
to
sue
for
the
amount
paid
and
that
assumes
the
diminution
of
the
value
of
the
stock
to
zero
and
the
number
of
potential
plaintiffs
is
limited
to
1,000,
the
actual
number
who
purchased
the
shares.
under
the
sec
proposal,
the
number
of
potential
investors
and
non-purchasers
and
thus
potential
plaintiffs
is
totally
unknown
and
only
limited
to
those
who
saw
or
alleged
they
saw
the
prospectus
notice
or
news
release
involved
and
the
amount
of
potential
liability
is
not
10
million.
it
is
also
unknown
and
without
limit.
stocks
have
been
known
to
increase
many
times
over
issue
price
and
they
are
innumerable
post
issuance
opportunities
to
be
an
alleged
potential
investor.
stocks
are
sold
and
resold
after
initial
issuance
and
there
is
no
limitation
under
the
sec
proposal.
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
yes
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
in
our
view,
mr.
justice
white
and
in
the
view
of
judge
hufstedler
in
dissent,
the
court
of
appeals
did
reject
the
birnbaum
rule
because
the
--
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
mr.
justice
white
analytically
rejected
the
birnbaum
rule
because
--
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
the
position
of
the
sec
and
with
--
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
that
we
agreed
that
there
are
particular
and
that
is
right
in
this
case
mr.
justice
white
but
we
also
think
the
majority
of
the
panel
below
did
not
expressly
reject
the
birnbaum
rule
and
name
because
it
recognize
that
another
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
mount
clemens
case
had
already
expressly
accepted
the
birnbaum
rule.
judge
hufstedler
in
dissenting
--
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
yes
mr.
justice
white.
in
the
mount
clemens
decision,
another
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
expressly
--
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
not
in
this
case,
the
majority
did
not.
judge
hufstedler
in
dissent
said
that
they
should
adopt
the
ninth
--
the
birnbaum
rule
that
it
exist
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
that
the
majority
was
trying
to
write
around
it
with
their
so-called
functional
equivalent
analysis
which
i
think
she
correctly
dissected
as
being
without
merit.
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
i
think
that
was
the
problem
majority
of
the
panel
was
faced
with
in
our
case
and
i
think
majority's
decision
and
their
seizing
on
this
concept
of
functional
equivalent
is
a
classic
law
school
textbook
example
of
hard
facts
making
bad
law.
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
yes,
mr.
justice
burger.
i
do
not
think
you
can
reconcile
the
reasoning
or
purported
reasoning
of
the
majority
panel
below
with
the
panel
in
mount
clemens
and
when
we
petitioned
for
a
rehearing
en
banc,
the
panel
in
mount
clemens
voted
for
granting
that
rehearing
en
banc
and
we
felt
--
we
received
five
votes
and
failed
just
one
vote
short
of
getting
a
rehearing
en
banc
in
the
ninth
circuit.
i
think
if
we
had
had
that
rehearing,
the
outcome
would
have
been
different
because
i
can
seen
intellectual
basis
for
distinguishing
the
majority
decision
of
the
panel
below
from
overruling
birnbaum.
they
simply
tried
to
ride
around
it
because
i
think
they
were
unduly
impressed
by
the
allegations
of
the
amended
complaint
here.
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
concur
that
it
is
in
so
particularly
on
the
--
another
issue
that
is
attempted
to
be
raised
by
the
sec
at
the
last
minute
and
that
is
whether
there
is
a
private
remedy
under
section
17
of
the
1933
act
other
than
is
set
forth
in
section
12
(2)
of
the
1933
act.
the
problem
is
that
there
is
no
civil
remedy
whatsoever
provided
by
congress
in
section
10
of
the
act
or
of
the
1934
act,
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart,
there
is
none
under
the
1934
act
at
all
expressly
provided
by
congress
as
there
is
under
the
1933
act
and
the
entire
remedy
that
is
before
the
court
here
has
been
judicially
created
commencing
with
the
kardon
case
in
1946.
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
it
has
never
been
explicitly
accepted
in
the
sense
that
the
standing
of
the
plaintiff
was
an
issue.
i
think
that
affiliated
ute
and
bankers
life
in
particularly
footnote
10
bankers
life
indicates
that
the
court
accepted
the
concept
of
an
implied
judicial
remedy
under
section
10
and
10b-5.
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
yes,
that
did
not
involve
that
issue
here.
one
other
--
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
you
denied
cert
with
three
justices
voting
to
grant
cert.
i
believe
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
mr.
justice
white,
mr.
douglas
--
justice
douglas
--
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
that's
--
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
that's
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
no,
i
do
not
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
certainly
should
be
and
we
did
not
intend
to
urge
before
the
court
this
morning
that
it
overruled
the
lower
courts
in
recognizing
a
judicially
and
private
--
implied
private
right
for
damages
under
section
10
but
certainly
that
could
be
a
legitimate
issue
before
this
court.
i
would
like
to
return
briefly
to
one
more
example
of
the
dangers
of
the
rule
advocated
by
the
sec
to
extend
this
private
implied
right
of
damages
to
potential
investors.
consider
the
potential
investor
who
has
only
$1,000
to
invest
and
consider
stocks
a,
b,
and
c
but
buys
only
a,
does
he
have
a
claim
for
--
excuse
me
--
a
price
rise
of
b
and
c?
what
if
stock
a
rises
more
than
b
and
c?
or
less
than
b
but
more
than
c?
then
if
you
multiply
this
--
the
number
of
stocks
a,
b,
and
c
by
the
number
of
different
stocks
traded
or
issued
each
year
and
have
this
investor
with
only
a
thousand
dollars
to
invest,
how
many
lawsuits
does
he
have?
or
in
fact,
does
this
potential
investor
even
have
to
invest
in
any
stock
at
all
but
simply
use
the
thousand
dollars
for
an
alternative
investment
and
play
the
market
without
cost
or
risk
of
lost
and
what
if
the
alternative
investment
rises
more
than
stock
a,
b,
or
c,
has
he
been
damaged
no
matter
how
fraudulent
the
prospectus
discouraging
him
to
purchase
stock
a,
b,
or
c?
and
one
final
problem,
one
of
the
tremendous
burden
on
the
federal
courts
to
be
forced
to
litigate
the
potential
merits
of
all
those
potential
investor
claims
brought
as
questionable
class
actions.
all
claims
seeking
speculative
lost
profits.
the
purchaser-seller
rule
as
developed
and
refined
over
the
past
quarter
century
accomplishes
the
salutary
purpose
of
establishing
rational
and
predictable
requirements
of
standing
for
the
proper
vindication
of
rule
10b-5
claims
with
probable
merit.
in
aggravated
cases
of
alleged
actual
fraud
such
as
claimed
in
one
count
here,
potential
investors
and
non-purchasers
have
an
appropriate
common
law
remedy
in
state
court,
just
as
respondent
is
pursuing
in
the
california
state
court,
but
the
purposes
and
policies
of
the
federal
security
laws
are
not
served
and
cannot
be
reconciled
by
allowing
any
and
all
non-purchasers
and
potential
investors
to
speculate
on
the
market
without
cost
or
risk
of
loss
and
at
the
expense
of
that
security's
market
actual
investors
in
a
federal
court
system
already
overburdened
with
litigation.
accordingly,
standing
under
10b-5
should
not
be
extended
judicially
to
such
potential
investors
and
non-purchasers
as
responded
in
the
instant
case.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
allyn
o.
kreps
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
birnbaum
is
actually
an
issue
in
this
case
and
in
further
response
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
blackmun,
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
district
court
was
expressly
made
on
the
ground
of
the
birnbaum
rule
and
the
memorandum
opinion
of
the
district
court
squarely
substantiated
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint
on
the
birnbaum
rule.
with
respect
to
whether
birnbaum
is
an
issue
here
and
there
is
inconsistency
in
the
circuits,
we
again
submit
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
in
the
ninth
circuit
between
mount
clemens
and
the
majority
of
the
panel
below
and
judge
hufstedler
in
her
dissenting
opinion
on
page
143
of
our
appendix
says
flatly,
“the
result
reached
by
the
majority
is
inconsistent
with
the
holding
and
reasoning
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
mount
clemens
industries,
inc.
versus
bell”
and
we
think
that
the
reason
the
majority
found
it
necessary
to
adopt
this
exceptionally
fussy
equivalent
function
analysis
was
that
there
as
now
conceded
by
respondent
no
contractual
right
under
the
consent
decree
and
merely
what
the
functional
equivalent
language
says
is
that
we
in
essence
are
finding
these
people
third
party
beneficiaries
of
a
contract
or
consent
decree
and
the
obvious
danger
of
that
reasoning
is
that
every
stock
issue
has
an
underwriting
contract
and
if
you
apply
that
reasoning,
you
could
find
every
underwriting
contract
between
the
issuer
and
the
underwriting
--
underwriter
and
the
subsequent
brokers
as
a
contract
made
for
the
ultimate
benefit
of
the
potential
purchasers
and
then
you
do
genuinely
get
into
the
parade
of
true
horribles
which
i
indicated
in
my
opening
argument.
the
only
explanation
we
have
for
the
panel
below
the
majority
going
arise
as
much
as
it
did
is
the
hard
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint.
but
if
there
is
any
merit
to
those
hard
facts,
they
may
be
vindicated
in
the
state
court
action
which
is
currently
pending.
one
last
point
and
that
is
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
question
on
the
eason
case
in
the
seventh
circuit.
should
the
purchaser-seller
rule
be
abandoned
or
bent
in
any
manner
as
the
eason
case
--
eason
court
favored?
it
should
be
noted
that
in
the
eason
case,
the
plaintiffs
there
in
the
words
of
the
court
suffered
“as
investors
and
as
principals
in
the
transaction”
and
they
were
shareholders
in
the
corporation
that
sold
stock
for
certain
assets
and
then
they
executed
a
personal
guarantee
of
the
liabilities
of
the
--
of
the
acquired
--
on
the
acquired
assets
to
someone
else.
they
certainly
could
have
brought
an
action,
derivative
action
on
behalf
of
their
own
corporation
as
a
result
of
the
purchase
or
sale
and
i
think
the
language
that
eason
court
indicates
that
they
actually
were
principals
involved
so
that
may
not
even
be
a
purchased
departure
from
the
purchase-seller
rule.
in
any
event,
it
would
not
be
a
sufficient
departure
to
encompass
the
respondent
in
this
case
because
everyone
concedes
that
they
are
not
purchasers,
not
sellers,
not
investors
and
have
never
expended
one
dime,
they
are
only
seeking.
thank
you
very
much.
