mr.
james
e.
ryan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
the
court
please.
i
feel
constrained
to
comment
upon
two
of
the
arguments
just
made
by
mr.
kreps.
one
is
in
response
to
a
question
by
the
court
whether
or
not
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
has
abandoned
the
birnbaum
rule.
in
the
mount
clemens
case
which
involved
the
situation
where
there
was
a
public
auction
of
securities,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
action
brought
a
10b-5
action
on
the
grounds
that
they
had
been
defrauded
from
making
a
bid
at
that
auction.
they
were
not
offerees
such
as
we
are
in
this
case.
they
had
no
transactional
or
causal
nexus
with
the
party
selling
the
shares
so
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
mount
clemens
found
that
there
was
no
standing
under
10b.
i
feel
by
that,
they
did
adopt
the
--
a
portion
at
least
of
the
birnbaum
rule.
another
argument
that
counsel
has
made
concerns
the
unknown
quantity
of
claimants
that
may
arise
if
the
example
of
an
offering
of
a
million
shares
and
there
may
be
50
million
people
that
will
come
later
when
the
stock
goes
up
and
say,
gee,
i
would
have
bought
that
stock.
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
here,
we
have
an
exact
amount
of
shares
offered
to
an
exact
amount
of
offerees
at
an
exact
price.
the
amount
of
persons
that
could
bring
a
claim
out
of
this
action
is
wholly
limited.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
i
should
preface
that
by
saying
that
i
have
seated
10
of
my
minutes
to
the
counsel
for
sec,
he
is
going
for
the
homerun
and
i
am
going
for
the
base
hit.
he
is
asking
the
court
that
the
birnbaum
rule
in
total
be
abolished.
i
am
saying
that
fine
if
that's
necessary,
if
that
will
get
us
our
day
in
court
then
fine,
but
we
are
submitting
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
necessary
in
our
case.
the
purchaser-seller
language
as
we
know
is
court
created.
10b
just
says
that
in
connection
with
the
purchaser
sale,
we
submit
that
when
congress
enacted
that
statute,
it
would
not
have
needed
the
language
in
connection
with
if
it
wish
to
limit
causes
of
action
under
that
section
to
strictly
purchase
--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
that's
correct.
however,
since
birnbaum
was
decided
in
1952,
the
cases
are
legion
which
have
attempted
to
get
away
from
the
harshness
of
that
rule
but
the
court
below
on
our
case
likewise
saw
a
harshness
in
the
rule.
there
have
been
the
four
seller
exceptions.
there
have
been
the
aborted
purchaser-seller
exceptions.
there
have
been
any
number
of
exceptions
including
the
most
recent
opening
of
the
doors
to
injunctive
relief.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
well,
in
the
situation
where
you
would
have
a
case
such
as
ours,
i
think
that
it's
presented
by
the
anomaly
of
the
situation.
if
the
petitioners
in
this
case
in
making
their
offering
had
persuaded
the
respondents
to
purchase
some
but
not
all
of
the
shares
to
which
we
are
entitled,
then
i
think
we
clearly
would
have
no
problem
with
the
purchaser-seller
rule.
what
the
petitioners
are
suggesting
is
that
since
they're
fraud,
since
there
misleading
statements
were
so
successful
that
we
didn't
buy
it
at
all.
that
therefore,
we're
outside
the
standing
requirements
and
we
feel
that
that
is
not
what
congress
intended.
that
is
the
atypical
fraud
which
had
been
pointed
out
by
several
of
the
circuits
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
just
outlaw
the
typical
kinds
of
fraud
and
this
is
certainly
an
atypical
kind.
this
is
a
highly
unusual
situation
where
you
have
an
offeror
putting
out
securities
that
hopes
won't
sell
and
that's
the
anomaly
of
the
situation.
i
think
to
deny
the
respondent's
standing
in
this
case,
to
bring
a
10b-5
action
sanctions
the
total
success
of
their
fraud.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
i
do,
your
honor.
i
feel
that
in
this
case,
i've
stressed
in
my
briefs
that
we
have
a
unique
set
of
circumstances.
we
have
a
unique
set
of
facts.
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
this.
i
think
when
it
discussed
the
birnbaum
rule
and
the
exceptions
there
under
to
the
effect
that
there
had
been
cases
where
the
courts
have
created
what
we
may
call
a
fiction
if
no
else.
whereby,
they
found
a
contract
to
purchase
or
sell.
we
had
situations
where
persons
bought
illusory
stock.
well,
that's
no
purchase
at
all
but
in
the
present
case,
the
ninth
circuit
saw
that
to
deny
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
standing
would
be
harsh.
they
found
that
the
peculiar
unique
rights
that
flowed
from
that
consent
decree,
that
duty
that
was
upon
the
petitioners
herein
to
make
a
fair
offering
served
as
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
contract.
and
i
think
that
this
case
can
properly
be
limited
to
that
area
of
exceptions
that
which
the
courts
have
now
recognized
to
the
birnbaum
rule.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
well,
--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
well,
i
think
first,
if
this
court
feels
that
our
case
as
presented
in
the
amended
complaint
does
not
fall
within
one
of
the
exceptions
or
is
not
an
exception
in
and
out
of
itself
because
its
peculiarity,
then
i
think
the
court
has
to
reach
the
whole
birnbaum
rule
on
whether
or
not
it's
valid.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
not
in
this
case
it
has
not,
has
not.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
it
did
do
so.
i
believe
that
it
did
adopt
the
birnbaum
rule
under
mount
clemens.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
is
and
has
--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
there
are
i
believe
three
or
four
circuits
that
have
not
directly
reached
the
birnbaum
issue
but
--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
if
--
if
this
court
found
that
this
present
case
did
not
come
within
one
of
the
exception,
then
you
would
go
back
and
i
would
think
that
the
court
would
follow
mount
clemens.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
ryan
it
has.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
i
--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
they
had
some
doubt
about
it
but
again,
the
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
was
denied.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
there
were
five
dissenting.
if
i
knew
the
total
number,
i
do
some
quick
subtraction
and
how
many
voted
for,
was
it
65?
mr.
james
e.
ryan
65.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
no,
we
had
that.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
yes.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
well,
for
two
reasons,
i
consider
it
inadequate.
one,
the
burden
of
proof
as
i
understand
it
in
a
states
securities
action
is
greater
than
it
is
under
10b.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
it's
fraud
that
we
alleged
in
the
final
analysis,
however,
the
test
as
i
understand
it
under
the
securities
exchange
act
is
that
the
plaintiff
is
not
required
to
bring
in
each
and
every
one
of
the
offerees
and
have
him
sit
on
the
stand
and
say
but
for
the
fraud
of
the
defendants,
i
definitely
would
have
purchased
the
stock,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
a
lesser
burden
of
proof,
that
is
that
the
misstatement
on
the
fraud
of
the
defendant
in
a
particular
10b
case
have
influenced
or
would
have
influenced
his
decision;
whereas,
under
the
state
securities
law
and
common
law
fraud,
he
would
have
to
go
through
the
normal
elements
of
a
fraud
case
to
show
actual
reliance.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
well,
again,
chief
justice,
i
feel
that
that
as
the
rules
on
proof
under
10b-5
actions
that
the
decision
of
the
investor
was
influenced
or
would
have
been
influenced.
i
don't
think
it
creates
an
imponderable
burden
for
the
plaintiff
in
a
class
action.
i
think
were
you
--
i
think
if
you
first
prove
that
the
allegations
or
i
should
say
the
statements
contained
in
the
--
what
we
termed
the
negative
prospectus
are
truly
misleading
and/or
false.
then
i
think
that
you
at
that
point
have
a
fraudulent
conduct
and
i
think
that
fraudulent
conduct
in
and
out
of
itself
would
probably
affect
the
decision
of
any
potential
investor
in
this
action.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
no,
i
do
not
think
it
goes
that
far.
i
think
that
he
would
have
to
--
have
to
show
some
knowledge
on
his
part
of
the
prospectus
but
i
don't
think
it
needs
to
go
to
far
beyond
that.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
you're
speaking
of
the
persons
that
are
in
this
selective
class
that
i
represent.
it's
possible
i
haven't
given
that
any
thought.
i'm
presuming
that
the
persons
who
would
come
within
the
class
in
this
case
would
be
those
who
had
received
and
considered
the
prospectus.
i
suppose
that
a
wall
street
journal
article
or
any
other
type
of
publications
concerning
this
offering,
if
it
contained
misleading
items
and
was
read
by
a
--
one
of
the
selected
offerees
would
sought
possibly
serve
the
same
function,
could
like
just
as
well
dissuade
him.
we
feel
that
the
test
to
be
used
in
the
purchaser-seller
case
in
such
as
this
and
was
applied
in
the
eason
case
is
determined
whether
or
not
the
plaintiffs
are
within
that
class
intended
to
be
protected
by
congress.
we
feel
that
the
nature
of
the
history
of
this
case
that
being
the
consent
decree,
the
duty
of
the
petitioners
to
make
a
fair
and
full
disclosure,
a
fair
and
full
and
honest
offering
to
the
plaintiffs
is
that
it
makes
them
that
type
of
person
intended
to
be
protected
by
congress.
the
--
i
see
a
common
strain
in
all
of
the
cases
which
have
considered
birnbaum
and
have
carved
out
the
several
exceptions
and
that
common
strain
i
see
is
a
transactional
or
causal
nexus.
counsel
has
expressed
concern
over
the
opening
of
the
floodgate
should
the
plaintiffs
of
this
action
be
permitted
to
have
their
day
in
court.
i
cannot
strenuously
enough
emphasize
that
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
man
on
the
street
who
might
have
bought
ibm
this
morning
at
10
o'clock
stands
in
the
same
shoes
as
the
plaintiffs
in
this
action.
here,
we
had
an
offering
that
was
made
pursuant
to
consent
decree.
we
had
a
specific
price.
we
had
a
specific
time.
the
defendants
in
this
case
had
a
duty
to
make
an
offering
and
we
do
not
feel
that
there
is
any
relationship
between
the
man
on
the
street
and
the
person
who
owned
a
right
or
entitlement
such
as
we
did
to
purchase
the
shares.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
if
no
offering
had
been
made?
mr.
james
e.
ryan
i
would
like
to
be
able
to
distinguish
the
control
data
corporation
case
and
the
like
but
i
don't
think
it
can
be
and
i
don't
think
it's
in
this
case.
i
don't
think
its
dispositive.
we
have
stated
in
our
briefs
that
we
do
not
pretend
to
enforce
that
consent
decree
in
this
action.
the
purpose
of
the
consent
decree
as
i
see
it
and
i
think
is
--
i'm
sure
as
the
ninth
circuits
are
serves
as
the
background
in
the
history
as
to
why
these
plaintiffs
and
these
defendants
had
such
a
unique
relationship.
why
were
not
the
men
on
the
street
that
might
invest
tomorrow
in
any
stock?
that
consent
decree
answers
that
question.
so,
we're
not
attempting
to
enforce
a
consent
decree.
i
don't
think
we
can.
i
think
the
cases
are
clear
on
that,
the
armour
and
control
data
corporation
cases.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
well,
i'm
not
saying
that
we
didn't
have
a
contractual
right.
i
--
mr.
james
e.
ryan
well,
as
the
ninth
circuit
stressed,
it
was
a
functional
equivalent
of
a
contract
to
purchase
these
shares.
we
should
not
as
the
ninth
circuit
said
and
also
in
the
eason
i
believe,
we
should
not
go
for
form
over
substance.
i
think
that's
what
we're
getting
at
here.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
you
mean
by
the
very
fact
you
distinguished
it
from
a
contract.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
i
think
so.
mr.
james
e.
ryan
i
have
nothing
further.
