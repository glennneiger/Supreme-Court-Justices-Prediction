j.
brennan,

apparently,
the
court
--
we
denied
certain
in
--
the
court
did
in
birnbaum
itself,
is
it
not
in
52?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
seventh
circuit
rejected
it
in
iscent
in
last
june
or
may
perhaps
last
october,
we
denied
cert
there,
didn't
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
where
the
congress
has
ever
been
asked
to
address
this
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
ryan,
it
think
that
if
judge
hufstedler
is
right,
mount
clemens,
they
did
adopt,
that
panel
did
adopt
the
third
circuit
rule,
then
the
practice
of
the
chief
justice
suggested
earlier,
i
would
suppose
that
we
did
what
my
brother
white
suggest
would
result
automatically
would
it
not
in
this
panel
following
mount
clemens?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
that
that
argues
---
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
we
have
to
say
that
the
functional
equivalent
it
to
say
it's
not
a
context,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
should
be
treated
as
if
there
were
one
although
in
fact
there
is
none,
isn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ferber,
has
the
commission
ever
asked
the
congress
to
do
anything
about
the
birnbaum
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
after
all,
it's
been
around
for
23
years
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
has
the
commission
been
as
restive
as
it
is
now
under
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
a
reason
not
to
go
to
congress,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather,
if
we
sustain
the
birnbaum
rule
and
the
commissioner
will
go
to
congress
and
ask
him
to
overrule
it.
