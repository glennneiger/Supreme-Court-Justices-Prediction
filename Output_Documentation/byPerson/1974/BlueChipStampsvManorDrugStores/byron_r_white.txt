mr.
kreps,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
court
of
appeals
reject
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
say
it
did.
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
said
this
was
--
it
didn't
violate
the
rule.
was
he
on
that
--
this
because
the
sale
followed
as
a
result
of
antitrust
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
taking
on
the
word
beneath
you
to
say
that
here's
another
court
of
appeals
that
embrace
the
birnbaum
rule,
this
didn't
apply
to
this
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
want
us
to
--
do
you
want
us
to
say
that
where
he
--
that
this
case
opposes
one
way
or
another
the
validity
of
the
birnbaum
rule,
just
forget
about
the
rational
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
go
right
to
the
--
to
what
you
think
is
the
heart
of
the
matter,
the
birnbaum
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
all,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
we
had
a
--
do
you
think
we
had
a
considered
discussion
by
a
court
of
appeals,
namely
the
ninth
circuit
as
to
whether
the
birnbaum
rule
ought
to
continue?
definitely
really
faced
up
to
it,
i'm
talking
about
the
birnbaum
rule
as
such
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
not
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
a
construction
of
the
statute
that
the
courts
have
been
engaged
in,
this
is
not
some
judicial
policy,
it's
a
construction
of
the
--
of
the
federal
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
disagreed
with
you
in
a
rational
distinction
and
that
--
and
that
it's
a
birnbaum
rule
was
to
be
followed
you
must
lose
this
case?
what
should
we
do
then
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
--
that
is
a
limited
exception
possibility
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
should
we
reach
the
issue
of
overruling
birnbaum
or
not
accepting
birnbaum
or
rejecting
it
or
should
be
remanded
in
ninth
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
we
have
--
why
wouldn't
we
remand
under
the
ninth
circuit
if
it
ever
considered
attention,
the
birnbaum
rule
assumption?
it
hasn't
here
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
hard
to
believe.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
it
was
going
birnbaum?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
they
went
on
birnbaum?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
you
i
think
it
would
say
that
the
exception
purportedly
carved
out
by
the
ninth
circuit
really
can't
withstand
analysis?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
amendment
that
what's
really
--
if
you're
going
to
have
the
birnbaum
rule,
the
result
reached
below
shouldn't
have
been
reached?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
other
words,
both
the
rule
and
exception
are
fictions
in
your
approach?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
been
around
for
a
long
time
in
second
circuit
and
that's
where
an
awful
lot
of
these
transactions
take
place.
