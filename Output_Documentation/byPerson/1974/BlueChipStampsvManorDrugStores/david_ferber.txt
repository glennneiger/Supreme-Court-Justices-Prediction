mr.
david
ferber
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
the
petitioner
is
urging
this
court
to
sanction
the
doctrine
that
would
deprive
the
conceded
victim
of
a
securities
fraud
of
standing
to
bring
any
action
for
his
damages
solely
because
he
was
not
a
purchaser
or
seller
of
securities.
now,
there
have
been
four
cases
decided
by
this
court
that
there
are
implied
causes
of
action
under
the
securities
exchange
act,
two
of
them
involving
10b,
the
associated
ute
case
and
the
superintendent
of
insurance
case.
the
standing
of
the
injured
plaintiff
here
to
bring
such
an
action
is
the
only
issue
in
this
case
before
the
court.
the
fraud
here
was
that
of
deceiving
persons
who
had
an
investment
decision
to
make
and
they
were
deceived
and
for
that
reason
they
are
seeking
damages.
the
dissenting
judge
below
admits
there
was
a
violation
of
10b-5
and
the
petitioner
concedes
it.
mr.
david
ferber
i
certainly
think
it
is,
it's
an
issue
that
the
seventh
circuit
has
said
we
will
not
adopt
this
doctrine.
several
circuits
have
held,
we
have
--
we
do
adopt
this
doctrine
and
i
think
it
is
certainly
right
for
review
by
this
court
under
those
circumstances
--
mr.
david
ferber
and
i
think
it
is
presented
by
this
case
because
at
least
it
is
arguable
with
respect
to
the
exemption
that
the
court
drew
whether
or
not
that
is
a
valid
exemption,
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
is
probably
just
as
much
litigation
now
as
to
what
is
exempt
under
the
so
called
birnbaum
purchase
and
seller
doctrine,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
doctrine
should
be
applicable.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
the
ninth
circuit
--
mr.
david
ferber
the
ninth
circuit
is
--
rule
is
that
they
believe
this
purchaser-seller
limitation
is
applicable.
they
are
making
an
exception
in
this
case
because
of
the
existence
of
the
antitrust
decree.
at
about
the
same
time
a
different
panel
of
that
circuit
very
shortly
before
this
opinion
in
the
mount
clemens
case
which
was
very
similar
to
this
in
some
respect,
the
court
determined
that
because
the
plaintiff
there
was
not
a
purchaser
or
seller,
he
had
no
cause
of
action.
now,
in
the
mount
clemens
case,
what
happened
was
this.
a
company
--
100%
of
the
shares
of
a
company
was
being
sold
at
auction
of
a
subsidiary
of
a
company
and
financial
difficulties.
the
company
that
was
in
difficulties,
whose
shares
were
being
sold,
had
an
officer
who
had
formerly
been
an
officer
of
the
plaintiff.
the
plaintiff
said,
we
are
going
to
bid
at
that
sale
and
this
officer
according
to
the
allegations
lied
to
him
and
told
him
that
the
business
of
the
subsidiary
was
no
good.
they
didn't
bid
in
the
sale
and
ultimately
the
officer
who
had
lied
allegedly
be
--
it
was
head
or
an
officer
of
a
different
company
that
ended
up
with
that
subsidiary.
mr.
david
ferber
that
the
court
relied
solely
on
this
purchaser-seller
doctrine
in
mount
clemens.
mr.
david
ferber
yes
your
honor
and
i
think
they
should
know
--
mr.
david
ferber
this
case,
they
walked
around
it.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
as
in
many
of
the
other
circuits,
the
ninth
circuit
says
we
subscribe
to
the
birnbaum
rule
but
we
find
exceptions
in
this
case
and
in
that
case
and
in
the
other
case.
mr.
david
ferber
precisely.
mr.
david
ferber
yes,
i
believe
so
your
honor.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
i
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
just
can't
accept
that
we're
going
to
have
the
birnbaum
rule.
i
mean,
i
don't
know,
i
think
that
any
exception
to
it
is
probably
a
reasonable
one
because
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
to
me
it
is
completely
arbitrary.
now,
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
think
the
rule
is
basically
--
well,
its
arbitrary,
i
don't
know
that
i
can
say
it's
a
fiction.
i
think
the
exceptions
like
most
exceptions
from
it
would
be
good.
now,
i
should
say
though,
first
of
all
--
mr.
david
ferber
well,
i
suppose
that's
right.
mr.
david
ferber
but
let
me
say
this.
it
does
not
mean
the
giving
up
the
rule,
does
not
mean
that
all
the
parade
of
horribles
that
were
set
forth
by
the
petitioner
would
necessarily
occur
or
would
occur.
there
are
various
distinctions.
i
think
there
are
many
cases
where
the
lower
courts
have
talked
in
terms
of
the
birnbaum
rule
because
other
circuits
had
mentioned
it
but
that
there
were
other
reasons
they
could
have
held
that
the
plaintiff
had
no
action.
for
example,
one
of
the
cases
cited
is
someone
against
wolfson,
i
can't
think
of
the
name
of
it
at
the
moment
but
what
was
charged
in
that
case
was
that
the
officers
of
the
company
had
manipulated
the
securities
and
then
bought
some
of
the
company's
securities
at
a
low
price
and
subsequently
manipulated
it
some
more
and
sold
back
to
the
company
at
the
higher
manipulated
price.
now,
the
action
was
brought
by
a
stockholder
of
the
company,
not
as
a
derivative
action
and
the
court
said,
well,
under
the
birnbaum
rule,
you're
not
a
plaintiff
--
a
purchaser
or
seller,
you're
just
a
stockholder.
on
the
other
hand,
had
they
brought
it
as
a
derivative
action,
the
company
was
certainly
a
purchaser
or
seller
and
i
certainly
don't
suggest
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
type
of
situation
should
necessarily
have
a
cause
of
action,
his
injury
was
indirect
through
his
corporation.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
that
case
illustrates
had
the
plaintiff
because
the
market
was
low
and
had
been
so
manipulated
sold
his
stock.
he
would
presumably
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
birnbaum
rule,
he
would
be
a
seller.
so,
that
is
why
i
am
saying
that
it
is
an
arbitrary
rule
and
i
guess
you're
correct
that
it's
an
artificial
rule.
mr.
david
ferber
well,
we
don't
think
this
court
has
never
acted
on
the
birnbaum
rule.
it
is
not
a
rule
as
far
as
--
mr.
david
ferber
well,
no,
your
honor,
i
mean,
i
was
perhaps
jumping
ahead.
mr.
david
ferber
what
i
am
saying
is
we're
--
mr.
david
ferber
it's
been
around
and
there
had
been
except
--
mr.
david
ferber
well,
we
have
filed
briefs
in
a
great
many
of
the
court
of
appeals
urging
that
the
so-called
rule
not
be
accepted
and
--
mr.
david
ferber
well,
in
part,
this
court
only
--
a
few
--
about
two
or
three
years
ago
in
affiliated
ute
and
the
superintendent
of
insurance
was
the
first
that
this
court
had
made
clear
that
there
is
a
private
cause
of
action
under
rule
10b-5.
the
district
--
the
lower
courts
for
sometime
had
been
finding
such
an
action,
but
until
at
least
there
was
judicial
opinion
at
the
top,
there
at
least
might
have
been
some
question
in
congress
why
should
we
be
running
up
there
with
him.
mr.
david
ferber
i
would
think
that
that
is
certainly
a
possibility.
mr.
david
ferber
i
don't
recall
any
instance
where
we
have
an
interpretation
of
the
court
of
appeals
going
to
congress
but
i
don't
want
to
say
your
honor
that
we
never
have.
mr.
david
ferber
that's
true
but
the
second
circuit
has
been
punching
more
holes
in
the
rule
than
almost
any
of
the
other
circuits
so
that
there
are
in
many
instances,
for
example,
it
was
the
second
circuit
that
said
that
it
doesn't
stop
an
injunction,
private
person
can
enjoin.
mr.
david
ferber
no,
no
your
honor.
i
don't
say
they
have
wiped
it
out.
that's
why
we
supported
the
petition
because
we
felt
they
hadn't
wiped
it
out.
that
they
had
carved
out
an
exception
where
we
felt
they
should
have
wiped
it
out.
i
should
say
by
the
way
on
the
en
banc
hearing,
my
--
i
maybe
wrong
but
i
think
if
i'm
not
mistaken
that
there
are
15
or
16
judges
on
the
ninth
circuit,
that's
one
of
the
real
big
ones
so
that
the
vote
of
five
--
mr.
david
ferber
13
is
it?
well,
i
knew
it
wasn't
just
five
to
six,
it
was
somewhat
bigger
majority
that
had
voted
against
the
--
mr.
david
ferber
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
had
not
occurred
to
me,
i
suppose
it
is
possible.
the
--
mr.
david
ferber
that's
right.
mr.
david
ferber
it
certainly
does
not
and
it
leaves
this
completely
arbitrary
rule
on
the
books.
mr.
david
ferber
there
is
a
square
conflict
--
mr.
david
ferber
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
david
ferber
that's
right.
and
why
for
example
--
one
of
the
cases
in
the
second
circuit
is
illustrative
it
seems
to
me
of
the
inequity.
actually
in
that
case,
they
ultimately
did
find
the
sale
but
this
was
a
case
where
in
connection
with
a
tender
offer,
the
allegations
were
that
there
had
been
a
misleading
offer.
most
of
the
stockholders
turned
over
their
shares,
90
some
percent
and
the
corporation
therefore
was
merged
out
of
existence
into
the
other
one.
this
--
the
man
who
sued
was
one
who
had
not
sold
his
securities
and
we
urge
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
second
circuit
at
that
time
since
he
was
not
a
seller
in
that
sense
to
ignore,
overrule
their
initial
birnbaum
rule
and
the
court
of
appeals
however
did
not
do
that,
instead,
they
said,
well,
ultimately
he's
going
to
have
to
sell
his
securities
and
therefore
we'll
treat
him
as
a
seller.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
logic
would
be
that
this
man
was
defrauded.
i
will
just
like
to
--
mr.
david
ferber
i
just
wanted
to
say
that
this
court
in
the
case
borak
case
stated
that
were
rights
under
the
securities
exchange
act
have
been
invaded,
federal
courts
may
use
any
available
remedy
to
make
good
the
wrong
done.
