justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kreps,
i
noticed
that
neither
you
nor
your
opponent
seem
to
have
cited
justice
stewart's
opinion
for
the
court
last
year
in
the
amtrak
case
where
the
court
held
that
provision
of
one
type
of
civil
remedy
excluded
another.
i
should
think
in
view
of
the
provision
of
section
11
and
12
of
the
act
of
1933
that
might
be
of
some
significance
to
your
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
do
you
distinguish
that
situation
in
the
language
of
the
rule
from
the
situation
that
your
opposing
counsel
was
posing
to
the
court
and
what
is
it
in
rule
10b-5
that
would
--
if
we
allow
this
would
prevent
the
many
other
suitors
who
are
not
precisely
in
your
situation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
so
harsh
about
it?
i
mean,
it's
just
a
line
drawing
that
you
have
in
every
single
area
of
the
law,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
a
plaintiff
in
a
10b-5
action
even
though
he
may
never
have
read
the
prospectus
simply
take
the
stand
and
say,
if
i
had
read
it,
it
would
have
influenced
me
against
buying
and
that
brings
him
within
the
class
that
is
entitled
to
recover?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
13.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
notation
is
that
the
five
judges
authorized
the
publication
of
their
names.
i
take
it
so
--
six
judges
might
have
voted
for
rehearing
en
banc
but
not
wanted
to
authorize
the
publication
of
the
fact.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
blue
chip
stamps
versus
manor
drug
stores,
the
question
is
the
validity
of
the
so-called
birnbaum
rule
which
may
mean
very
little
to
the
public
at
large
or
even
to
the
bar
at
large
but
is
of
considerable
importance
to
the
securities
bar.
respondent
manor
drug
stores
brought
suit
against
petitioner,
blue
chip
stamps
and
others
under
section
10
of
the
1934
securities
exchange
act.
manor
drug
was
an
offeree
of
a
registered
stock
offering
of
newly
issued
stock
of
blue
chip
which
was
required
to
be
made
under
the
terms
of
a
previously
entered
antitrust
consent
decree.
manor
urged
that
blue
chip
had
distributed
a
materially
over
pessimistic
prospectus
in
connection
with
this
offering
in
order
to
cause
offerees
not
to
purchase
the
offered
stock.
and
that
it
in
fact
had
not
purchased
the
offered
stock
because
of
the
false
prospectus.
manor
sought
to
recover
damages
for
loss
of
the
opportunity
to
purchase
shares
under
rule
10b-5
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
act
which
prohibits
certain
fraudulent
conduct
in
connection
with
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities.
despite
the
fact
that
manor
drug
was
not
an
actual
purchaser
or
seller
of
shares,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
it
was
not
barred
from
recovering
under
rule
10b-5.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
that
holding
and
we
now
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
since
the
judgment
in
birnbaum
versus
newport
steel
corporation
in
1952,
a
case
decided
by
the
second
circuit,
almost
all
of
the
lower
federal
district
courts
to
be
presented
with
the
issue
have
held
that
the
purchaser
or
seller
status
is
a
prerequisite
to
the
maintenance
of
a
private
damage
action
under
rule
10b-5.
efforts
to
change
this
longstanding
rule
by
amendment
of
the
statute
have
been
uniformly
unsuccessful
and
there
is
considerable
evidence
that
the
birnbaum
rule
reflects
the
intention
of
congress
as
expressed
in
the
1933
and
1934
acts.
since
respondent
manor
drug
is
neither
a
purchaser
nor
a
seller
of
securities
as
defined
in
the
1934
act
and
required
by
the
birnbaum
rule,
it
cannot
bring
a
10b-5
damage
action.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
therefore
reversed.
mr.
justice
powell
joined
by
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
marshall,
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
joined
by
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
