chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
74-124,
blue
chip
stamps
and
others
against
manor
drug
stores.
mr.
kreps,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
not
a
court
of
appeals
including
the
ninth
circuit
normally
not
permit
to
one
panel
of
the
court
and
three
judges
to
overrule
the
holdings
of
another
panel
especially
if
they
are
recent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
are
you
suggesting
that
what
they
did
was
do
indirectly
that
is
overruled,
that's
earlier
panel
decision
without
saying
so
by
indirection.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
kreps.
mr.
ryan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
think
it
can
be
limited
in
that
category,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
court
has
on
occasion
when
there
was
a
conflict
in
panels
in
the
circuit
and
the
circuit
certified
the
cases
with
doubtful
question
remanded
and
said
in
effect
resolved
your
own
conflicts
first,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
there
is
no
conflict
between
what
the
panel
did
in
mount
clemens
and
what
the
panel
did
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
panel
in
mount
clemens
were
apparently
thought
so
or
at
least
had
some
doubt
about
it,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
was
the
vote
on
that
denial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
this
kind
of
situation
lends
itself
to
a
class
action
when
the
proof
under
this
ninth
circuit
holding,
the
proof
in
each
case
would
be
likely
to
vary
a
great
deal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
indicated
earlier
did
you
that
if
he'd
read
about
it
in
the
newspaper,
the
wall
street
journal
for
example,
would
that
be
enough
even
if
he'd
not
seen
the
prospectus?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
ferber.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
almost
wait
until
this
court
has
acted
or
have
you
sometimes
gone
to
congress
with
recommendations
on
the
basis
of
court
of
appeals
holding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
and
mr.
ryan
seem
to
disagree
a
little
bit.
he
at
least
intimates
rather
strongly
for
me
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
just
punched
the
holes
to
take
your
phrase,
punched
another
hole
in
the
birnbaum
doctrine,
you're
taking
the
position
that
they
have
wiped
it
out
if
i
understood
you
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
13.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
that
it's
not
uncommon
for
courts
of
appeals
or
other
courts,
intermediate
courts
to
evolve
exceptions
to
rules
over
a
period
time
and
that
sometimes
the
exception
finally
swallow
up
the
rule.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
now
say
that
this
exception
doesn't
swallow
up
the
entire
rule.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
time
is
expired
unless
you
just
want
to
set
us
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
kreps,
you
have
six
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
kreps.
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
