justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
ryan,
on
that
same
point,
do
you
consider
your
state
remedy
inadequate
and
if
so,
in
what
respect?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
would
that
be
so?
isn't
this
garden
variety
fraud
that
you
alleged
in
final
analysis?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
ryan,
lets
assume
for
the
moment
that
no
offering
had
been
made
at
all
as
they
have
been
required
by
the
consent
decree,
would
your
clients
have
had
a
cause
of
action?
this
cause
of
action?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
none.
no
offering
had
been
made
although
the
consent
decree
may
have
required
it.
in
other
words,
could
your
clients
have
enforced
the
consent
decree
by
a
suit
against
the
petitioner?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
had
no
right
under
the
decree
and
no
contractual
right
to
have
a
chance
to
buy
these
securities?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
what
was
it?
