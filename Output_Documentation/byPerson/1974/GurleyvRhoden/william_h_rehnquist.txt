justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
something
of
a
difference
though
in
your
case
in
so
far
as
it
turns
on
the
federal
statute
and
in
that
party
your
case
where
it
turns
on
two
state
statutes.
i
take
it
in
the
latter
case
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
is
free
to
decide
who
the
tax
is
imposed
on
and
what
role
the
tax
collector
has
in
a
way
that
it
isn't
where
you've
got
a
federal
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
what
authority
would
we
have
for
doing
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
davis,
just
--
just
before
lunch
you
were
asked
i
believe
by
justice
white
whether
the
mississippi
sales
tax
or
the
federal
gas
tax
had
provisions
for
passing
on
or
separate
statement.
let
me
ask
you
the
same
question
about
that
mississippi
gasoline
tax.
is
there
any
provision
in
the
statute
which
imposes
that
tax
that
either
requires
it
being
passed
on
or
prohibited
being
passed
on
or
requires
it
to
be
separately
stated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
the
state
of
mississippi
couldn't
measure
its
sales
tax
on
the
gross
business
done
by
a
retailer
even
though
some
of
the
retailer's
sales
were
on
a
credit
basis
in
the
people
to
--
purchasers
to
folder?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you
have
a
2%
sales
tax
on
a
druggist
and
its
on
gross
business
he
does
and
his
gross
business
is
$2
million
during
a
particular
tax
period
but
in
fact
a
$100,000.00
of
those
sales
were
for
credit,
he
never
got
the
cash
and
a
certain
number
of
those
default
so
they're
bad
debts,
would
you
say
that
the
state
had
to
constitutionally
recognize
an
allowance
for
a
bad
debt
there?
