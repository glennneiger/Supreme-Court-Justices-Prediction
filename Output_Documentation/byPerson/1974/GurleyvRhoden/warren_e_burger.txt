we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1734,
gurley
against
rhoden.
counsel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
i
get
you're
argument
correctly
in
your
briefs
mr.
davis,
you're
saying
the
state
has
no
more
right
to
tax
him
for
being
this
conduit
than
they
could
tax
an
internal
revenue
agent
who
collects
the
money
and
passes
it
on
to
the
collector
in
mississippi,
is
that
about
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
the
construction
is
the
construction
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
is
it
not
of
the
state
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
davis,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
partly
--
is
that
partly
because
that
could
be
one
way
to
separate
tax
free
sales
from
other
sales?
certain
purchase
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
certain
purchasers
of
gasoline
purchase
tax-free,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
depending
on
the
use?
now,
is
this
statute
geared
to
that
proposition
if
it
were
taxed
back
at
an
earlier
point
you'd
have
no
way
of
at
least
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
separate
them,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
remember
reading
it,
to
where
in
your
brief
is
that,
what
page?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
go
on
with
your
argument,
i
just
wanted
to
locate
that
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
for
lawnmowers
of
whatever
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
on
the
federal
statutes
relating
to
withholding
taxes
and
i
suspect
on
social
security
taxes
there
are
some
special
sanctions
for
failing
to
deliver
them
that
is
there
constituted
trust
fund,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
you
have
a
parallel,
an
exact
parallel
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
have
an
exact
parallel
in
term
of
--
terms
of
sanctions
for
not
paying
it
other
than
just
the
normal
penalties
for
not
paying
a
tax?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
are
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
general
term
for
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
spread
it
out
a
little,
will
you,
before
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
in
both
cases
there
are
trust
fund
concept?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gholson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
specific
corrections
you
want
us
to
make
on
particular
pages
or
you
just
want
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
blue-covered
brief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
about
the
language
of
55
–
27-55-11,
maybe
you've
gone
over
that
but
it
went
over
my
head
if
you
did.
the
language
is,
“shall
pay
for
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
such
business,
a
tax
equal
to
8
cents
a
gallon,”
is
that
just
a
new
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
this
is
in
which
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
to
what
extend
did
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
rely
on
that
language
that
it's
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
doing
business
rather
than
a
tax
on
the
consumer
per
gallon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
that's
why
i
got
lost
on
some
of
the
colloquy.
i
thought
that
this
statute
was
an
explicit
effort
to
separate
this
from
the
normal
tax
which
is
placed
on
the
consumer,
the
sales
tax
on
commodity,
and
here,
it's
a
tax
on
the
privilege.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
right,
that
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
davis
i
thought
said
on
the
question
of
where
this
tax
fell
that
would
--
it
was
limited
to
tax
on
gasoline
used
on
the
highway,
do
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
statute
seems
to
be
pretty
clear
in
saying,
for
sale
or
for
sale,
use
on
the
highways,
storage,
distribution,
or
for
any
other
purpose.
now,
does
that
mean
that
lawnmower
gasoline
is
subject
to
the
tax?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
a
farmer
--
the
farmer
who
uses
it
on
his
tractor
can
keep
a
record
and
go
and
get
a
refund?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
then
the
lawnmower
fellow,
if
he
--
if
it
was
worth
his
trouble
could
do
the
same
under
your
statute,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
gholson.
thank
you
mr.
davis.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
73-1734,
gurley
against
rhoden
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
