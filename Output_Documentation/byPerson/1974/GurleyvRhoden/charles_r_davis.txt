mr.
charles
r.
davis
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
charles
davis
of
jackson
mississippi,
along
with
mr.
walter
armstrong,
mr.
hubert
mcbride
of
memphis,
and
mr.
tom
tardy,
also
of
jackson.
i
represent
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
w.
m.
gurley,
doing
business
as
gurley
oil
company.
this
action
was
brought
by
mr.
gurley
for
the
recovery
or
refund
of
sales
taxes
imposed
by
the
state
of
mississippi.
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
denied
mr.
gurley’s
claim.
this
court
granted
certiorari
on
november
18,
1974.
the
issue
on
this
appeal
and
in
the
proceedings
below
was
stipulated
by
the
parties
and
that
is
contained
at
page
36
of
the
10
appendix,
and
that
issue
is
whether
or
not
federal
and
state
gasoline
excise
taxes
are
properly
or
legally
includable
in
gross
proceeds
of
sale
or
in
the
sales
price
of
gasoline
under
the
mississippi
sales
tax
act.
now
mr.
gurley's
contention
is
that
he
collects
these
two
excise
taxes.
that
is
the
federal
excise
tax
on
gasoline
and
the
state
excise
tax
on
gasoline.
and
that
he
makes
this
collection
as
an
agent
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
that's
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
we
are
saying
that
he
merely
acts
as
an
agent
because
of
the
point
in
the
process
of
distribution
than
he
happens
to
follow.
he
is
the
closest
to
the
consumer
of
the
gasoline
and
logically
and
practically,
the
tax
scheme
of
both
statutes
imposes
this
duty
of
collection,
reporting
and
payment
to
the
tax
authorities
on
him.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
mr.
justice,
its
our
contention
that
this
court
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
may
disregard
the
characterization
of
that
mississippi
excise
tax
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
and
the
designation
of
the
tax
as
a
privilege
tax
by
the
legislature
and
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
well,
we've
cited
authorities
in
our
brief
which
we
believe
indicates
that
where
constitutional
questions
are
presented
such
as
we
have
here
where
if
mr.
gurley
is
taxed
a
sales
tax
by
the
state
of
mississippi
is
imposed
upon
mississippi
gasoline
excise
taxes
in
his
hands
that
that's
to
take
his
property
without
due
process
of
law,
and
therefore
we
submit
that
this
court
may
look
to
the
operation
and
effect
of
the
mississippi
statute
and
determine
that
despite
the
ruling
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
that
it
is
a
tax
on
the
consumer
of
gasoline.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
this
court
in
several
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
has
disregarded
state
court
characterizations
and
some
of
our
statutes
involving
a
gasoline
excise
taxes.
and
we
submit
that
under
the
circumstances
here
that
you
may
do
so.
of
course,
there's
no
contention
as
you
point
out
mr.
justice
that
this
court
does
not
have
authority
to
determine
the
incidence
of
the
federal
excise
tax
on
gasoline.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
and
the
case
is
cited
there.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
so,
we
are
asking
this
court
to
determine
the
incidence
of
these
two
gasoline
excise
taxes
and
secondly,
we
are
saying
that
the
court
may
in
the
case
of
mr.
gurley,
who
is
actually
a
retailer
of
gasoline
that
it
may
determine
that
even
though
the
incidence
is
on
the
seller
that
if
the
taxes
accrue
at
the
time
of
sale
that's
its
impossible
for
these
taxes
to
be
included
in
gross
proceeds
or
as
a
part
of
the
sales
price,
and
therefore,
the
state
of
mississippi
cannot
impose
a
sales
tax
on
it
at
that
juncture,
the
sales
tax
accruing
at
that
time
simultaneously
on
the
retail
sale
of
the
gasoline.
i
would
like
to
briefly
state
to
the
court
a
little
bit
about
mr.
gurley's
operation.
the
amount
of
the
taxes
here
was
actually
stipulated
and
that's
in
summary
of
that
is
found
at
page
36
of
the
10
appendix.
mr.
gurley
protested
vigorously
the
payment
of
these
taxes.
he
refused
to
pay
the
taxes
and
additional
assessments
were
rendered
by
the
state
of
mississippi,
at
which
time
he
did
pay
them
but
throughout
the
period
involved
in
the
case
at
bar,
he
bore
himself
the
burden
of
all
these
taxes
that
he
seeks
the
refund
for
it.
mr.
gurley
is
a
small
independent
gasoline
operator.
it
is
located
in
west
memphis
arkansas
and
he
has
a
number
of
retail
outlets
in
the
northern
portion
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
he
purchases
his
product
there
in
the
memphis
area
and
transports
it
by
his
trucks
to
the
retail
outlets
where
the
product
is
sold
directly
to
the
ultimate
retail
consumer
of
the
gasoline
for
use
on
the
highways.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
not
that
i'm
aware
of
your
honor.
that's
i
have
read
is
a
similar
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
--
operation
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
so,
there's
no
middleman
or
wholesaler
or
distributor
involved
here
in
the
case
of
mr.
gurley.
now,
the
mississippi
sales
tax
act
imposes
a
5%
tax
on
the
gross
proceeds
of
any
retail
sale
of
tangible
personal
property.
now,
this
sales
tax
is
computed
by
mr.
gurley
and
we've
summarized
that
computation
at
page
12
of
our
very
petitioner’s
main
brief.
as
i
indicated,
he
purchases
the
product
over
at
around
memphis
for
approximately
--
well,
at
the
time
of
the
trial
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
mr.
justice,
that's
absolutely
correct,
but
at
that
time
back
in
1971,
he
bought
the
gasoline
at
about
14
cents
per
gallon,
imposed
his
markup
to
a
retail
price
of
the
actual
gasoline
of
20
cents
per
galloon.
and
at
that
point,
mr.
gurley
imposed
the
5%
mississippi
sales
tax
on
the
20
cents.
now,
he
separately,
he
contends,
collects
the
federal
excise
tax
on
gasoline
and
the
state
excise
tax
on
gasoline,
and
during
all
of
this
period,
he
did
not
impose
nor
pass
on
any
5%
sales
tax
on
the
two
excise
taxes.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
mr.
gurley
pays
the
federal
tax.
he
actually
makes
remittances
to
federal
depositories
in
much
the
same
manner
as
social
security
and
withholding
remittances
are
made
on
the
first
--
within
three
days
after
the
1st
and
15th
of
the
each
month.
however,
he
files
a
quarterly
return
which
actually
determines
the
final
amount
of
his
payment.
and
we
submit
that
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
no,
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
that's
not
an
issue
here
we're
attempting
to
get
a
refund
of
additional
sales
taxes
above
that
1
cent.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
that's
correct.
i
wish
to
point
out
that
mississippi
is
one
of
few
states
that
actually
imposes
a
sales
tax
on
gasoline
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
--
at
all
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
--
on
any
part
of
the
price
of
gasoline.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
there
is
no
expressed
statutory
requirement,
that's
correct
but
we
submit
that
a
view
of
the
entire
operation
that
affect
both
statutes
compels
a
conclusion
that
that
these
taxes
be
collected
from
the
ultimate
consumer
on
the
actual
number
of
gallons
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
it's
only
paid
once
your
honor.
its
--
the
statute
provides
in
26
u.s.c.
4083
that
the
sale
to
a
bonded
producer
is
a
tax
free
sale,
so
that
the
tax
is
only
collected
at
the
point
closest
to
the
ultimate
retail
sale
of
the
gasoline.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
in
mr.
gurley's
case,
there's
only
one
place
where
it
can
be
collected
because
he
buys
it
from
the
manufacturer
or
supplier
and
makes
it
the
direct
sale
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
now,
in
other
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
thank
you.
your
honor.[lunch
recess]
mr.
charles
r.
davis
your
honor,
at
the
time
of
--
at
the
time
period
of
the
case
at
bar
which
is
from
1968
through
sometime
in
1971,
for
approximately
three-fourths
of
that
time,
there
was
a
provision
in
the
mississippi
gasoline
excise
tax
statutes
that
provided
that
the
seller
could
pass
on
to
the
ultimate
consumer
the
amount
of
the
mississippi
gasoline
excise
tax.
they
let
mississippi
legislature
repeal
that
provision
in
1970.
but
for
most
of
the
period
of
time
in
question,
we
did
have
that
provision.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
it
simply
repealed
your
honor
the
provision
allowing
or
expressly
allowing
the
passing
on
the
tax
and
we
submit
that
in
practice,
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
operation
and
effect
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
your
honor,
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
decals
were
posted
at
most
of
his
retail
locations.
there
is
no
statutory
requirement
to
that
effect
but
this
was
done
by
mr.
gurley.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
the
same
practice
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
--
applies.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
7
cents
per
gallon
--
7
cents
per
gallon.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
--
at
that
time,
its
now
9
cents
gallon.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
excise
tax
on
gasoline
and
4
cents
per
gallon
for
the
federal
excise
tax
on
gasoline.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
a
later
section
of
26
u.s.c.
provides
a
definition
of
the
term
producer
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
--
under
the
statute.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
i
believe
that
it
provides
that
any
purchaser
of
gasoline,
tax-free
is
considered
to
be
a
producer
under
the
federal
statute
and
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
that's
correct.
that
purchase
was
tax-free
and
the
tax
does
not
come
into
play
in
the
case
of
gurley
particularly
until
the
time
of
the
retail
sale
to
the
ultimate
consumer.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
well,
it
certainly
not
unusual
in
the
case
of
those
operators
similarly
situated
to
mr.
gurley
and
the
scheme
of
the
statute
is
that
the
tax
be
collected
at
the
source
closest
to
the
ultimate
retail
sale.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
the
language
does
not
expressly
state
that
but
suppose
there
were
a
series
of
sales
to
various
wholesalers
or
producers
and
a
chain
of
distribution.
those
sales
are
tax-free
because
a
sale
to
another
producer
under
the
statute
does
not
give
rise
to
the
tax
liability.
it
only
arises
at
the
end
of
the
chain
of
distribution
or
at
the
point
closest
to
the
ultimate
retail
sale
and
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
no,
your
honor
because
of
the
fact
that
mr.
gurley
is
a
producer
under
the
statute
and
is
properly
qualified.
that
would
be
a
tax-free
transaction.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
if
he
was
qualified
under
the
federal
statute
and
it
is
possible
i
think
for
him
to
so
qualify,
then
he
would
pay
it
but
he
were
not,
then
the
tax
would
be
remitted
by
the
wholesaler.
now,
we
cite
in
our
brief
a
reference
to
the
revenue
ruling
which
indicates
that
it's
the
intent
of
the
statute
to
impose
the
tax
at
the
latest
point
of
distribution
and
that
the
liability
of
the
producer
that
is
responsible
for
emitting
and
reporting
does
not
accrue
until
there’s
been
an
ultimate
retail
sale.
now,
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
well,
i
think
perhaps
that
is
one
purpose.
of
course
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
the
refund
provisions
are
referred
to,
i
believe
on
pages
14
and
15.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
so,
we
submit
if
it
please
the
court
that
the
resolution
of
this
basic
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
inclusion
of
state
and
federal
gasoline
excise
taxes
in
the
sales
tax
based
is
to
be
determined
by
this
court
looking
at
the
actual
effect
and
operation
of
the
two
gasoline
excise
tax
statutes.
the
purpose
of
both
of
these
statutes
is
unquestionably
to
raise
funds
to
finance
and
construct
highways
on
the
state
and
federal
level.
the
intent
of
congress
is
obviously
to
impose
that
tax
upon
the
persons
who
use
these
highways
and
to
measure
the
tax
in
proportion
to
the
use
of
the
highways
by
the
ultimate
consumer
of
the
gasoline
and
the
operation
and
effect
of
the
statute
is
clearly
one
that
measures
the
tax
on
that
sale
of
each
galloon
that
goes
into
the
car
on
the
highway,
there's
no
tax
ever
paid
for
a
nonhighway
use
of
any
sort
if
it's
use
for
farming
purposes
or
local
transit
systems
or
if
it
spilled
out
on
the
ground
or
if
it's
destroyed
in
the
fire.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
or
for
lawnmowers
or
whatever
unless
it's
actually
used
on
the
highways,
there's
no
tax
paid.
that's
the
ultimate
effect
and
operation
of
both
the
federal
and
the
state
gasoline
excise
tax
is
in
question.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
they
both
have
the
same
broad
exemption
for
nonhighway
use.
they
break
it
down
into
different
categories
are
briefed
on
but
basically,
it
has
that
exemption
on
that
nonhighway
use.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
it's
on
the
consumer
mr.
justice
white,
we
submit
that
it's
impossible
for
the
mississippi
sales
tax
to
be
imposed
on
that
portion
of
the
price
that
mr.
gurley
collects
from
the
consumer.
this
is
not
a
part
of
its
price.
it's
not
a
part
of
his
gross
proceeds
of
the
retail
sale.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
that's
correct,
it
is.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
well,
that's
one
reason
and
the
case
of
the
federal
tax,
this
is
money
that
he
holds
in
his
hands
that
belongs
to
the
united
states
government
and
to
tax
that
would
be
to
tax
the
federal
government.
in
the
case
of
the
state
tax,
again,
its
moneys
that
belongs
to
the
state
government
and
to
tax
those
state
taxes
would
be
to
take
gurley's
property
without
due
process
of
law.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
unconstitutional
exercise
of
the
taxing
power
of
the
state
of
mississippi
to
make
those
impositions
of
the
sales
tax.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
it
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
well,
that's
correct
and
that
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
--
that
aspect
of
is
very
real
in
the
state
of
mississippi
where
all
of
the
bordering
states
because
of
this
sales
tax
have
a
price
of
3
or
4
cents
per
gallon
less
than
we
do
in
mississippi.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes
your
honor
and
that's
true
in
the
case
of
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
i
would
think
that
that
it
would
be
very
nearly
exact.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
well,
there
are
criminal
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
--
penalties
that
are
provided
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
the
federal
statute
and
the
state
statute
both
provide
that
it's
an
absolute
liability
of
the
seller
to
collect
and
report
these
money
in
the
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
we
submit
that
that
is
the
case
your
honor
and
that
on
the
failure
to
do
so,
he
is
liable
for
--
to
criminal
penalties
in
the
statute.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
in
this
case
we’re
talking
about
approximately
$100,000.00
over
a
period
of
about
six
years
and
we
--
as
indicated
in
our
brief,
we
have
filed
for
a
later
period
that
involves
about
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
it's
originally
7
and
now
its
9.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
yes
your
honor,
it
was.
we
did
not
brief
it
in
and
discuss
it
as
thoroughly
as
we
have
in
this
court.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
it
--
i
believe
that
it
was
pleaded
in
--
if
you
read
the
context
of
the
factual
allegations
and
quotations
of
our
statutes
in
there,
i
think
it's
inescapable
that
the
constitutional
issues
there,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
well,
your
honor
we
do
not
condemn
the
concept
of
tax
on
a
tax
as
such.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
but
in
this
case,
we
think
it's
not
alright
for
the
reasons
that
we've
stated.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
well,
in
almost
every
retail
sale
of
any
product,
you
have
built
in
to
the
price
taxes
that
accrued
back
up
the
line.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
well,
we're
submitting
that
that's
the
difference.
here,
the
time
of
approval
here
is
different.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
because
on
the
state
tax,
they
would
be
extracting
from
mr.
gurley.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
well,
but
at
the
time
of
the
collection,
they
would
be
extracting
a
sale
tax.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
that's
true.
he
does
pass
it
on
but
he
makes
the
payment
--
mr.
charles
r.
davis
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
there
is
a
liability
here
in
our
case
for
collection
and
payment
clearly
by
the
seller.
if
he
does
not
make
that
collection,
he's
liable
for
the
payment
but
we
submit
that
that
situation
must
be
distinguished
from
the
actual
legal
incidence
of
the
tax
and
that
is
no
more
than
a
case
of
an
agent
having
the
duty
to
make
this
collection.
we
have
not
covered
the
point
of
a
credit
sale
in
our
discussion
of
this
case.
i
--
normally,
the
--
of
course
the
retail
sale
of
gasoline
is
not
done
on
a
credit
basis.
mr.
charles
r.
davis
thank
you,
your
honor.
