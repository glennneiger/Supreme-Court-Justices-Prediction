mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset
of
the
argument
before
the
respondent,
i
want
to
confess
and
apologize
for
two
factual
errors
which
appear
in
the
respondent's
brief.
i
do
not
think
that
either
of
them
go
to
the
merits
of
the
argument
but
do
i
apologize
for
them.
although
the
mississippi
supreme
court
very
clearly
based
its
decision
which
is
here
under
consideration
on
a
treatment
of
the
panhandle
oil
company
case
decided
by
this
court
with
respect
to
its
dealing
with
the
mississippi
gasoline
excise
taxes
as
they
existed
at
the
time
of
that
decision.
we
have
incorrectly
categorized
those
taxes
as
sales
taxes
in
our
brief.
they
were
excise
taxes
as
mr.
davis
points
out
in
his
brief.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
just
want
to
apologize
for
having
referred
to
that
as
a
sales
tax.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
with
respect
to
our
argument
on
the
fact
that
the
decision
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
is
not
subject
to
review
by
federal
courts
with
respect
to
the
incidence
of
the
mississippi
tax
which
is
in
point
for
of
our
brief,
we
have
cited
two
cases
and
quoted
from
one
of
them.
we
cite
society
for
savings
versus
bowers
and
agricultural
national
bank
versus
state
tax
commission.
we
have
attributed
the
quotation
to
the
bowers
case;
it
actually
comes
from
the
agricultural
and
national
bank
case
at
the
point
where
bowers
is
cited.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
unfortunately,
you
have
been
furnished
with
a
copy
of
the
first
brief
before
it
was
reprinted
and
it
is
not
in
the
proper
form,
this
brief
has
been
reprinted
and
i
believe
the
other
justices
have
the
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes
sir,
that's
properly
printed,
the
other
one
was
not.
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
argument
that
has
been
made
here,
i
can
find
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
powell's
question.
i
can
find
no
reference
in
the
original
complaint
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
statutes
are
cited
and
it
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
mr.
gurley
is
entitled
to
a
refund
by
reason
of
those
statutes.
i
believe
it
would
be
fair
to
argue
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
that
for
this
court
to
determine
that
the
mississippi
case
must
be
reversed
would
require
this
court
to
rule
that
the
mississippi
sales
tax
laws
are
unconstitutional
or
violative
of
the
united
states
constitution.
section
27-65-3
of
the
mississippi
code
of
1972
provides
that
gross
proceeds
of
sale
shall
include
among
other
things
all
taxes
except
those
which
are
specifically
exempt
by
a
subsequent
section.
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
on
page
15
makes
reference
to
this
problem.
the
federal
diesel
fuel
tax
is
specifically
exempt
because
it
is
a
part
of
chapter
32
of
26
united
states
code,
a
part
of
chapter
31
which
is
entitled
retailers
excise
taxes
and
the
diesel
tax
is
a
part
of
that,
the
diesel
taxes
are
exempt.
on
the
contrary,
the
gasoline
excise
tax
of
the
united
states
is
not
included
in
that
chapter
but
is
in
chapter
32
entitled
manufacturers
excise
taxes.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
that
under
the
sales
tax
statute
of
mississippi,
mr.
gurley
is
not
entitled
to
deduct
the
federal
gasoline
excise
tax
as
he
is
not
entitled
to
deduct
the
mississippi
gasoline
excise
tax.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes,
justice
powell.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
the
mississippi
supreme
court
decided
that
under
the
--
their
understanding
of
the
prevailing
rules
of
this
court
that
the
federal
excise
tax
is
legally
an
incident
placed
upon
wholesaler,
mr.
gurley,
and
not
upon
the
consumer
and
for
that
reason
is
not
--
is
a
part
of
the
gross
sale
price.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
the
state
franchise
tax
has
been
determined
by
the
state
supreme
court
to
be
legally
upon
the
wholesaler,
because
it
is
imposed
at
the
moment
that
the
tax
is
brought
into
the
state
and
i
think
this
gets
us
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
found
nothing
in
the
complaint
that
alleges
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
no
sir,
no
sir.
i
do
not
believe
they
raise
them
after
that
question.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes,
sir.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
no
sir,
we're
not
arguing
that
at
all.
i
simply
--
i
recognized
that
this
court
has
the
duty
to
review
the
decision
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
then
i
think
it
would
be
the
duty
of
this
court
to
reverse
as
to
the
federal
tax,
but
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
what
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
believe
that's
a
sort
of
two-pronged
question
mr.
justice
white.
first,
the
sales
tax
statute
of
mississippi
by
its
term
includes
the
federal
excise
tax
in
the
based
for
sales
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
no
matter
whether
it's
an
incident
placed
on
the
consumer
or
the
wholesaler.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
they
decided
it
on
the
theory
that
the
incidence
of
the
federal
tax
was
on
the
wholesaler.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
am
suggesting
that
one
can
make
a
strong
argument
for
the
fact
that
in
order
to
reverse
as
to
the
federal
tax.
this
court
would
have
to
declare
that
sales
tax
provision
unconstitutional.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
then
i
would
like
to
change
my
answer
to
your
question
because
unless
she
finds
that
the
sales
tax
provision
as
interpreted
by
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
is
unconstitutional
federally
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--
then
it
would
be
irrelevant.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
would
never
be
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
well,
i
would
never
be
quoted
as
making
the
first
statement.
i
think
that
they
could
have
decided
it
as
they
decided
it
or
on
the
second
theory
which
we
discussed.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
that
is
the
new
statute
but
that
does
not
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--
differ
from
the
language,
the
material
language
mr.
chief
justice
has
existed
since
1928
when
mississippi
amended
its
statute
in
response
to
the
panhandle
decision.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
that
is
the
gravamen
of
the
mississippi
opinion.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
we
were
speaking
now
of
the
mississippi
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
--
excise
tax.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
and
it
is
clearly
is
that
a
the
tax
used
when
the
commodity
comes
into
the
state
and
payment
must
be
remitted
by
the
20th
of
the
following
month
irrespective
of
any
date
of
sales
or
instant
of
sale.
now,
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
i'd
understood
they
referred
to
the
federal
excise
tax
and
its
inclusion
in
the
sales
tax
based
by
virtue
of
this
mississippi
decision
which
was
made
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
is
an
incident,
a
legal
incident
placed
upon
the
wholesaler
and
not
upon
the
consumer.
i
think
that
it
is
rather
essential
to
the
issue
here
to
get
down
to
something
that
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
powell
and
that
is
whether
mr.
gurley
is
a
wholesaler
or
a
retailer.
i
think
he
is
in
fact
both
because
under
the
definition
of
producer
or
distributor,
he
is
that
and
becomes
liable
for
the
tax
when
he
brings
it
in
to
mississippi.
the
fact
that
he
chooses
to
sell
it
directly
to
the
ultimate
consumer
does
not
prevent
him
from
being
under
the
language
of
the
statute
a
producer
or
distributor.
the
effect
of
mr.
gurley's
position
being
sustained
would
be
that
all
those
retailers
who
purchase
from
wholesalers
would
have
to
include
the
excise
tax
in
the
sales
tax
base
but
mr.
gurley
would
be
excused
from
including
it.
and
therefore,
we
would
argue
that
if
there
are
any
federal
constitutional
issues
here,
they
mitigate
in
favor
of
the
system
that
the
respondent
has
urged
and
that
the
mississippi
court
has
adopted.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
no
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
any
provision
for
relief
to
people
who
bare
the
economic
burden
of
this
tax
and
who
are
not
highway
users
come
from
other
statutes,
other
sections
giving
rights
of
credit
or
refund.
i
do
not
believe
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
that's
correct.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
that
is
my
understanding,
yes.
the
illinois
court
in
its
decision
in
the
martin
case,
very
similar
to
this
case
under
consideration
addressed
itself
to
that
point
and
said
that
these
are
not
technically
refund
statutes,
they
are
really
credits
given
to
people
who
bare
an
economic
burden
contrary
to
the
intention
of
the
statute.
mr.
davis
has
argued
that
it
is
the
intention
of
the
congress
to
tax
the
users
of
the
highways
to
pay
for
highways
by
such
taxes.
i
think
it
could
be
as
logically
argued
that
it
is
the
intention
of
the
excise
statutes
to
tax
the
people
who
engaged
in
the
business
of
selling
gasoline
for
use
on
such
highways.
certainly,
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
chief
justice
says
that
it
is
a
privilege
tax
placed
upon
doing
that
business.
i
would
like
to
mention
that
with
respect
to
state
court
interpretations
of
the
legal
incidence
of
the
united
states
excise
tax,
pennsylvania,
michigan,
north
dakota
and
lower
courts
of
new
york
if
taken
the
view
that
that
federal
tax
is
a
consumer
or
user
tax.
illinois,
new
jersey,
indiana,
alabama
and
georgia
as
well
as
mississippi
have
taken
the
view
which
we
espouse
here.
now,
in
the
reply
brief
for
the
respondent,
a
considerable
attack
is
made
upon
the
citation
of
the
ferrari
case
from
new
jersey
saying
that
that's
only
a
tax
commission
case.
that
case
has
since
been
affirmed
by
the
new
jersey
superior
court
and
reported
and
a
certification
has
been
denied
by
the
new
jersey
supreme
court.
that
brings
us
to
the
point
where
the
highest
court
of
new
jersey
has
acted
on
that
case,
and
i
have
those
citations
if
it
would
be
proper
to
give
them.
the
127
new
jersey
supreme
court
240
317
atlantic
2d
80,
is
the
opinion,
the
subsequent
denial
of
certification
is
without
opinion.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
that
is
correct.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes,
sir.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
understand
that
the
petitioner
here
is
challenging
the
validity
of
that
determination
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
that
is
our
position
entirely
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
we
believe
that
the
earlier
precedents
of
this
court
would
say
that
the
state
determination
of
that
state
statute
as
to
its
legal
incidence
is
final.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes
sir,
yes.
i
think
that
if
this
case
is
--
if
this
court
affirms
the
position
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
as
to
the
federal
statute,
then
there
would
be
no
question
about
the
state
statute.
it
could
affirm
as
to
the
state
statute
but
not
as
to
the
federal.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
federal
question
on
the
imposition
of
the
state.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
is
bound
by
its
earlier
precedents
to
honor
the
state
determination
of
the
state
tax
and
we
so
on
in
our
brief.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
but
that
--
and
that
because
of
the
conflict
among
the
states
in
interpreting
the
legal
incidence
of
the
federal
tax
that
this
court
must
determine
that
question.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
distinctions
in
our
situation
and
that
of
that
of
the
trustee
theory
of
tax
collection
advanced
by
the
petitioner
page
36
of
his
brief.
the
petitioner
cites
a
number
of
cases
in
which
the
merchant
or
some
other
person
has
been
held
to
be
a
trustee
for
the
federal
government
in
the
collection
of
certain
federal
taxes.
in
the
principal
case
cited
in
the
body
of
the
brief,
pazner
(ph)
versus
o'connell,
the
jewelry
excise
tax
as
i
understand
the
statute
was
placed
upon
the
retail
sale
to
the
customer
and
that
made
the
jeweler
a
collector
or
trustee.
likewise,
the
toll
bridge
tax
in
the
united
states
versus
washington
toll
bridge
cited
in
the
footnote
was
imposed
on
the
person
who
was
paying
for
the
use
of
the
toll
bridge
by
statute,
again
a
trustee.
the
united
states
versus
first
capital
national
bank
was
a
tax
imposed
upon
the
price
of
admission
to
collegiate
athletic
functions
by
the
united
states
and
again
as
a
trustee
situation.
we
submit
that
that
is
entirely
distinct
from
the
instant
case
in
which
both
the
federal
and
state
statutes
are
imposed
upon
the
producer
or
wholesaler.
we
would
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
cases
which
have
been
decided
by
this
court
since
the
panhandle
oil
company
decision
which
give
credence
to
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
that
this
court
has
determined
that
the
federal
gasoline
excise
tax
is
placed
upon
the
consumer
in
the
king
and
boozer
decision
which
we
think
specifically
overruled
in
part
the
panhandle
decision.
the
opinion
of
the
court
stated
to
the
extent
that
this
court
had
adopted
a
doctrine
of
economic
burden
as
determining
legal
incidence,
that
doctrine
was
repealed.
in
the
subsequent
case
of
kern-limerick
cited
by
the
petitioner,
no
modification
of
king
and
boozer
was
done
by
this
court,
but
there
was
simply
a
finding
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
united
states
navy
was
the
purchaser
of
tractors
and
therefore
was
immune
from
the
placement
of
the
arkansas
sales
tax
which
was
placed
on
the
consumer.
we
would
submit
that
the
language
of
the
illinois
court
in
the
martin
case,
its
rational
as
adopted
by
the
mississippi
court
in
this
case
is
persuasive
of
the
fact
that
the
federal
tax
is
not
a
tax
placed
upon
the
ultimate
consumer.
that
it
is
a
tax
placed
upon
the
wholesaler.
the
question
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
whether
or
not
the
mississippi
sales
tax
is
in
issue
and
i
understood
counsel
to
say
that
the
validity
of
the
mississippi
sales
tax
is
not
in
issue.
we
would
submit
again
that
if
the
language
of
the
mississippi
sales
tax
law
is
accepted
as
constitutional
and
valid.
that
that
language
itself
includes
both
of
this
excise
taxes
in
the
tax
based
from
which
the
sales
taxes
are
computed.
the
question
has
been
asked
several
times
as
to
whether
or
not
the
mississippi
law
requires
that
the
excise
tax
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
definitely
no.
in
the
statute
before
its
last
amendment
in
1970,
there
was
a
provision
that
the
tax
could
be
passed
along
to
the
consumer
and
that
provision
was
eliminated.
there
has
never
been
a
provision
that
the
tax
must
be
passed
along
to
the
consumer
and
this
question
was
addressed
in
by
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
the
thoni
oil
cases
in
which
the
georgia
court
held
that
the
federal
tax
was
includable
because
it
did
not
have
to
be
passed
on
except
as
an
economic
burden
if
at
the
discretion
of
the
payer
of
the
tax.
while
on
the
other
hand,
the
georgia
statute
was
so
written
that
the
georgia
tax
would
be
passed
on.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
valid
distinction
and
an
additional
basis
under
which
the
position
of
the
mississippi
and
illinois
and
new
jersey
courts
should
be
sustained.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
no,
no.
the
authority
to
pass
it
on
has
been
eliminated
from
the
statute.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
as
an
economic
burden
as
this
court
and
others
have
said,
all
cost
of
doing
business
are
in
effect
passed
on.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
as
an
economic
burden,
yes
sir.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
but
the
question
that's
been
asked
about
whether
or
not
the
price
specifically
showed
that
the
tax
was
excluded.
the
price
on
the
pump
itself
did
not.
it
included
the
excise
taxes
in
the
price.
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
that's
correct,
but
there
were
decals
which
mr.
gurley
in
his
testimony
alleged
that
he
had
at
his
service
station
which
showed
that
taxes
broken
out
of
--
mr.
hunter
m.
gholson
yes
sir.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
this
concludes
the
argument
for
the
respondent.
thank
you.
