unknown
speaker
you're
in
this
point
that
we've
just
been
discussing
you're
relying
on
the
--
that
part
of
your
brief
that
begins
on
page
--
part
6
beginning
on
page
14
of
your
reply
brief,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
portion
of
your
--
unknown
speaker
and
the
case
is
there
cited.
unknown
speaker
does
he
have
any
connections
with
the
phillips
down
there?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
similar
operation.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
these
prices
are
a
little
out
of
date
now,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
when
does
mr.
gurley
pay
the
federal
tax?
unknown
speaker
that
there's
no
issue
here
about
that
1
cent
sales
tax,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
in
this
case
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
the
general
1
cent
sales
tax
is
not
here
an
issue
at
all?
unknown
speaker
in
addition
to
this
--
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
in
mississippi,
is
the
sales
tax
required
to
be
passed
on
to
the
seller
and
not
to
the
buyer
stated
separately?
unknown
speaker
now,
how
about
the
--
but
there's
no
requirement
that
an
excise
tax,
the
federal
excise
tax
to
be
passed
on
to
anybody?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
excise
tax
is
paid
only
once?
how
about
a
sale
to
mr.
gurley?
unknown
speaker
now,
you
mean
from
mr.
gurley?
unknown
speaker
what
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
mean
gurley
still
charge
the
same
price
after
the
repeal
as
he
did
before?
unknown
speaker
a
price
had
included
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
while
before,
did
he
ever
sign
which
indicated
that
the
tax
was
being
in-charge
to
consumer
separately
from
the
rest
of
the
price?
unknown
speaker
this
was
done
now
before
the
repeal?
unknown
speaker
and
after
the
repeal
what
then?
unknown
speaker
the
same
--
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
decal
actually
says
what?
add
it
to
the
price
as
whatever
that
number
cents?
unknown
speaker
yes
but
that's
what
it
appear?
unknown
speaker
that
included
in
the
price
of
7
cents
per
gallon,
now
9
cents
per
gallon
representing
the
mississippi
franchise
tax,
that
is
the
excise
tax.
unknown
speaker
mr.
davis,
mr.
gurley
is
a
retailer,
isn't
he?
unknown
speaker
how
does
he
come
within
the
terms
of
26
u.s.c.
4081
on
page
3
of
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
that's
4082?
unknown
speaker
and
how
does
a
retailer
fit
within
that
definition?
unknown
speaker
oh!
and
so
gurley
didn't
pay
the
wholesaler
or
the
producer
any
tax?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
way
the
oil
business
is
normally
conducted
or
is
this
unusual?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
derive
at
from
this
language?
unknown
speaker
if
gurley
had
bought
from
a
wholesaler,
will
the
wholesaler
have
been
obligated
to
pay
any
tax?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
just
own
a
one
filling
station
and
were
a
retailer
and
nothing
else
that
if
he
bought
from
a
wholesaler,
who
would
pay
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
federal
tax,
does
it
have
the
same
wide
exemption
or
is
it
exempt
on
the
farm,
agricultural
use?
unknown
speaker
but
i
--
i
suppose
in
both
these
cases,
once
the
--
if
this
case
were
decided
against
you,
gurley
would
never
suffer
any
loss
in
the
future?
he
just
collected
whatever
it
was,
the
total
tax
where
it
load
from
the
consumer?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
--
does
5%
on
11
cents
about
a
half
cent
a
gallon
is
--
unknown
speaker
--
how
much
money
we're
talking
about
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
been
update
9
cents,
usually
8
now
its
9
cents.
unknown
speaker
mr.
davis,
was
the
constitutional
issue
raised
before
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
--
wasn't
addressed
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
and
was
it
raised
in
the
complaint?
relied
upon?
unknown
speaker
mr.
davis,
do
i
oversimplify
in
describing
your
argument
as
one
that
this
in
effect
is
a
tax
on
a
tax?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's
alright?
unknown
speaker
when
would
it
ever
be
alright?
unknown
speaker
directly?
unknown
speaker
with
all
the
state
tax,
it
seems
to
me
that
there's
nothing
--
if
the
state
wants
to
tax
its
own
property
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that
like
there
is
the
state
trying
to
tax
what
you
say
is
federal
property.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
in
the
picture,
he
could
just
add
it
on
at
the
price.
unknown
speaker
not
extracting
it,
there
he
is
charging
the
seller;
he
is
charging
the
buyer
for
it,
like
he
has
to.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
as
long
as
he
passes
it
on
doesn't
come
out
of
his
pocket
and
you
have
another
ground
on
the
federal
side
that
he
just
can't
tax
the
federal
government?
unknown
speaker
you
say
he
did
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
federal
question
involving
the
state
--
imposition
of
the
sales
tax
on
the
state
franchise
tax?
what's
the
better
--
unknown
speaker
then
is
this
to
suggest
that
at
least
as
to
the
sales
tax
as
imposed
on
the
state
franchise
tax,
the
7
cents
we
have
no
jurisdiction
to
treat
the
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
do
can
agree
that
the
imposition
of
sales
tax
on
the
federal
excised
tax
of
4
cents
is
here?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
mississippi
situation
now?
that
the
state
tax
cannot
be
passed
on?
unknown
speaker
expressly?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
situation?
may
it
be
passed
on
or
no?
