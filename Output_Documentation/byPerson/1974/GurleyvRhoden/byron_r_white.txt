justice
byron
r.
white
so
where
do
you
go
from
here.
suppose
it
is
on
this
--
on
the
consumer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
its
part
of
the
money
and
part
of
the
price
he
takes
from
the
consumer
in
the
sense
that
he
collects
that
money
from
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
didn't
collect
it
from
them
he
would
have
to
pay
it
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
does
collect
it
from
the
consumer
for
a
reason
that's
to
keep
it
from
coming
out
of
his
own
pocket.
now,
why
can't
the
--
why
can't
the
state
put
a
sales
tax
on
it,
that
part
of
it,
because
of
immunity
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
it
loses
maybe
he
can
go
by
supplying
depends,
he
might
lose
--
he'd
say
i'd
sell
less
gasoline.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
--
your
court
had
felt
that
it
must
decide
the
federal
question
as
to
where
the
federal
excise
tax
has
its
burden
or
its
incidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
agree
with
that?
i
mean
you
don't
--
you
may
not
--
and
you
do
agree
with
the
way
they
decided
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
--
so
that
the
federal
--
you're
not
suggesting
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
here
because
the
federal
question
wasn't
decided
by
the
highest
court
of
your
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
supposed
we
--
supposed
we
disagreed
with
the
mississippi
supreme
court
that
the
incidence
of
the
federal
tax
is
on
the
consumer?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
if
--
what
if
we
just
said
we
reverse
the
taxes
on
the
consumer
and
we
reverse,
what
would
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
do
then
under
its
tax
laws?
because
that
isn't
a
--
this
isn't
a
constitutional
question,
this
question
i
just
--
were
just
talking
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
constitutional
question
is
just
a
--
it's
just
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute
erroneously
and
if
we
decided
against
you,
and
so
as
so,
what
would
the
mississippi
court
do
if
that’s
all
we
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
--
why
then
did
the
mississippi
supreme
court
go
to
great
--
such
great
pains
just
to
look
at
where
the
incidence
of
the
federal
tax
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it's
irrelevant
under
your
statute,
you're
suggesting.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
you
just
told
me
no.
you
just
said
no
that
if
we
disagreed
with
you
as
to
the
incidence
of
the
federal
tax,
we
should
reverse.
justice
byron
r.
white
well;
i
suggest
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suggest
that
the
--
you're
suggesting
the
mississippi
--
that
your
court
went
through
a
wholly
unnecessary
useless
procedure
in
deciding
where
the
incidence
of
the
federal
tax
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suggest
they
--
i
suggest
they
felt
it
was
essential
to
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
--
makes
--
did
you
--
did
the
state
supreme
court
construe
the
state
excise
tax
on
gasoline
to
be
a
tax
on
the
seller?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that's
a
state
law
question,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
assuming
that's
correct,
do
you
understand
there
to
be
any
challenge
then
to
the
collection
of
a
sales
tax
on
the
total
sales
price
including
the
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
that
just
a
state
law
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
--
he
gets
to
his
constitutional
questions
only
if
the
tax
is
on
the
consumer?
if
you
construe
the
excise
tax
to
be
on
the
consumer.
justice
byron
r.
white
different
from
the
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
one
you
reached.
