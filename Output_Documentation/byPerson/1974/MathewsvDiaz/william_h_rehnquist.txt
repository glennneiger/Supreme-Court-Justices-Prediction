justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
heard
after
judge
cohen
moved
up
to
west
palm?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
certification
without
regard
to
whether
the
members
of
the
class
had
individually
made
application
to
the
socials,
the
secretary
or
its
delegates.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mrs.
shapiro,
i
am
still
not
clear,
did
the
class
include
some
persons
who
had
in
the
past
been
denied
what
the
district
court
felt
they
were
entitled
to
but
who
had
not
in
the
past
made
some
sort
of
application
to
the
secretary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nothing
about
whether
or
not
they
--
this
action
was
brought
within
60
days.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
object
on
that
grounds
then
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
had
been
the
long
legislative
history
all,
is
that
recalls
you
by
a
paragraph,
does
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
factor
was
there
but
i
think
it
was
dealt
with
fairly
shortly
in
the
legislative
history.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
disagree
then
with
the
import
of
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
in
the
earlier
case
that,
that
test
is
â€“
is
there
any
conceivable
set
of
facts
that
would
support
this
distinction?
you
say
that
congress
must
have
manifested
its
concern.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
test
and
cases
like
mcgowan
against
maryland
which
simply
says,
if
on
any
conceivable
hypothetical
state
of
facts,
this
discrimination
can
be
justified,
it
survives
the
equal
protection
test.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
rational
basis
test
when
applied
to
people
as
you
conceive
it
to
be
is
not
the
same
test
as
when
it
is
applied
to
merchants
who
have
to
close
on
sundays?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
merchants
somehow
that
were
forced
to
close
in
mcgowan
less
people
than
the
aliens
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
by
hypothesis,
when
you
are
applying
the
rational
basis
test,
you
have
already
said
that
it
is
not
a
suspect
classification.
if
it
is
a
suspect
classification,
presumably
you
do
not
have
to
defend
on
the
rational
basis
test.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
recede
only
step
by
step.
