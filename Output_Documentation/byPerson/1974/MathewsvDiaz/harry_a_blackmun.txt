before
you
sit
down,
this
is
probably
totally
unimportant,
but
i'm
interested
in
the
compliance
of
the
three-judge
court
statute.
originally
judge
cohen
was
designated
as
the
receiving
judge
and
then
was
replaced
by
judge
king.
do
you
know
the
reason
for
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
it's
very
definitely
in
the
appendix
and
the
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
the
statute
is
pretty
specific,
you
see?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
feinberg,
i
think
it's
important
to
find
out
the
reason
for
these
substitution
of
judge
king
for
judge
fulton,
would
you
ascertain
that
and
let
the
court
inform
by
a
letter?
