paul

let
me
interrupt
at
this
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
your
colloquy
with
the
chief
justice.
as
i
understand
that
you
would
not
have
the
attacked
the
first
requirement
of
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residents,
if
it
were
not
for
the
words
for
permanent
residents.
you
would
agree
that
congress
could
rationally
distinguish
between
illegal
and
legal,
illegally
present
aliens.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
to
the
five-years,
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
congress
could
have
drawn
line
at,
say,
six
months?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
would
you
agree
that
they
could
have
drawn
it
on
thirty
days?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
agree
we
could
draw
some
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
line
would
be
equally
precise
with
the
one
that
they
did
draw.
just
be
a
shorter
lines.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
just
harm
fewer
people,
because
of
the
difference
in
five-years
and
thirty-days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
test
as
i
understand
you
is
the
significance
of
the
relationship
between
this
country
and
the
aliens.
thirty
days
is
alright
that
a
longer
--
it
is
still
the
same
yardstick,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
within
the
thirty-days,
they
do
become
persons
entitled
of
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
73-1046,
the
case
involves
a
challenge
to
the
constitutionality
of
a
portion
of
the
social
security
act,
which
makes
resident
aliens
who
are
over
65,
ineligible
for
participation
in
a
medical
insurance
program
unless
they
have
been
admitted
for
permanent
residence
and
also
have
resided
in
the
united
states
for
at
least
five
years.
a
three-judge
district
court
sitting
in
the
southern
district
of
florida,
held
the
statue
unconstitutional.
the
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal.
as
we
point
out
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
congress,
which
has
broad
power
over
immigration
and
naturalization,
has
no
constitutional
duty
to
provide
all
aliens
with
the
welfare
benefits
provided
to
citizens.
the
real
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
discrimination
between
aliens
and
citizens
is
permissible,
but
whether
the
statutory
discrimination
within
the
class
of
aliens
is
permissible.
we
hold
that
the
statutory
requirements
chosen
by
congress
which
render
eligible
those
aliens
who
may
reasonably
be
assumed
to
have
a
greater
affinity
to
the
united
sates
than
those
who
are
ineligible,
is
constitutional.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
