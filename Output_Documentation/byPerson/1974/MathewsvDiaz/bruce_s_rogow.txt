mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
argument
as
to
jurisdiction,
is
contained
in
our
supplemental
reply
brief
and
i
think
after
hearing
mrs.
shapiro
this
afternoon.
i
think
we
are
basically
in
agreement,
there
is
clearly
jurisdiction
as
to
diaz
and
clara
and
as
i
read
mrs.
shapiro’s
position,
there
is
a
concession
that
the
government
did
stipulate
to
the
finality
of
the
decision
regarding
mr.
espinosa
and
that
stipulation
as
to
finality.
therefore,
means
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
as
to
espinosa.
the
class
matter,
i
think
is
not
really
very
important
if
the
statute
falls
in
this
case
as
to
espinosa
than
it
falls
as
to
everyone.
but
i
think
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
supplemental
brief.
if
you
read
the
class
as
those
who
have
been
denied,
then
mr.
espinosa
and
others
who
have
applied
and
been
determined
not
eligible
would
be
included.
i
think
the
important
part
of
this
case
obviously
has
to
do
with
whether
or
not
congress
can
treat
aliens
and
discriminate
against
aliens
in
the
way
that
the
government
would
like
to
have
us
believe.
the
government
attempts
to
cast
this
case
as
one
in
which
congress
has
exercised
its
plenary
power
over
immigration
and
under
the
theory
that
the
government
advances,
this
statutory
resident’s
requirements
in
this
case
are
somehow
linked
to
the
plenary
power
over
immigration.
they
encourage
or
discourage
immigration.
if
the
government
is
right,
everyone
of
the
200
and
some
odd
statutes
that
they
have
listed
in
their
appendix
to
the
wong
brief
must
then
be
read
as
somehow
encouraging
or
discouraging
immigration.
with
nothing
more,
no
other
evidence
should
substantiate
that
merely
because,
they
classify
based
upon
alienage.
what
is
fatal
to
the
government’s
theory
is
that,
that
would
require
the
court
to
indulge
the
assumption
that
all
of
these
statutory
classifications
based
upon
alienage
are
somehow
attempting
to
regulate
admission
or
exclusion
of
aliens
and
i
give
the
court
one
example,
which
i
think,
underscores
the
fallaciousness
of
that
position.
mrs.
shapiro
refers
to
the
supplemental
security
income
statute
that
is
titled
42
united
states
code
section
1382.
in
that
statute
which
provides
a,
to
the
aged,
blind
and
the
disabled.
the
government
has
not
drawn
a
line
that
precludes
aliens
from
receiving
those
benefits.
people
here
under
color
of
law,
conditional
entrance
for
parolees
can
receive
those
benefits
using
the
government’s
logic.
that
would
mean
that
that
statute
in
some
way
is
seeking
to
encourage
immigration.
obviously
not.
at
the
most,
what
can
be
said
for
these
statutes
is
that
when
they
classify
based
upon
alienage
that
classification
perhaps
is
in
someway
related
to
the
benefits
that
the
government
is
extending
in
this
case
for
instance.
i
think
quite
frankly
what
the
government
is
doing,
what
the
congress
has
done
in
this
classification
is,
it
has
said
that
aliens
with
some
ties
to
this
country
would
be
entitled
to
certain
welfare
benefits,
certain
health
care
benefits.
it
has
not
said
this
is
encouraging
or
discouraging
immigration,
it
is
not
related
at
all
to
immigration
and
i
think
that
if
one
then
strips
the
constitutional
cloak
of
immigration
power,
of
plenary
power
from
this
case,
we
come
up
with
the
statute
that
in
many
ways
resembles
the
statutes
tracked
down
by
this
court
in
graham
versus
richardson.
statutes,
which
provide
important
welfare
or
health
care
benefits
and
then
discriminate
against
a
class
of
people,
aliens.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice,
those
people
certainly
would
not
be
included
within
those
who
would
obtain
benefits
under
the
statute,
they
are
not
people
whom—
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
those
people
are
not
in
the
country
with
any
kind
of
legal
status
at
all,
they
are
illegal.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
only
diaz
and
clara,
i
believe
you
are
speaking
of,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
mr.
espinosa
is
here
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residents
under
the
meaning
of
the
immigration
law.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir,
they
are
here
in
a
special
category.
but
it
is
certainly
not
the
same
category
as
those
who
sneak
in
the
country
and
those
who
jump
shift
and
come
into
the
country,
their
category
is
one.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no
sir,
that
the
needs
for
medical
care
maybe
the
same
but
if
we
use
the
government's
position
which
is
that
there
is
some
requirement
that
congress
can
impose
there
being
some
tie
to
the
country,
those
people
could
legitimately
be
excluded.
people
who
fall
in
what
is
known
as
a
non-immigrant
categories,
visitors,
visiting
journalists
who
are
just
on
an
assignment
to
this
country,
those
people
have
no
ties
to
the
country
and
perhaps
we
would
agree
that
it
is
legitimate
for
congress
to
draw
a
line
in
that
way.
it
is
rationally
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
program
which
is
to
provide
medical
care
to
those
who
have
some
ties.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no.
i
do
not
think
the
ties
–
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because
the
journalist
has
his
home
elsewhere.
these
people
have
their
homes
here,
these
people
have
their
residences
here.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
one
looks
the
definition
of
residents
under
the
title
viii
section
1101
of
immigration
law,
residence
means
the
place
of
general
abode
the
principal
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact
without
regard
to
intent
by
the
way,
but
it
is
the
actual
dwelling
place
in
fact
and
if
one
is
going
to
look
for
definitions
and
one
looks
there
that
the
refugees
in
this
case
have
their
principal
places
of
abode
here.
but
i
do
not
want
to
get
tied
to
immigration
law
in
this
case
because
it
is
not
an
immigration
case.
we
are
saying
mr.
chief
justice,
with
regard
to
those
special
people,
diaz
and
clara.
we
are
saying
that
the
lawfully
admitted
provision
as
applied
to
them
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
not
rationally
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
provide
medical
care
to
the
elderly
who
have
some
ties
to
the
country.
diaz
and
clara
have
ties
to
the
country;
they
are
excluded
under
the
statute
that
exclusion
is
irrational
given
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
technically
it
is
a
fair
statement
as
–
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
fair
statement,
i
do
not
think
that
the
government
–
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because
i
do
not
think
that
the
cuban
refugees
who
have
a
very
unique
status
in
this
country,
there
are
many,
many
statutes
providing
all
kind
of
benefits,
resettlement
benefits
to
them,
placement
benefits,
job
training
benefits
to
them.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
does
not
cut
directly
the
other
way
as
applied
to
them.
it
precludes
them
but
in
response
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
which
is,
are
these
people
temporarily
here
and
will
they
be
excluded,
the
hypothetical
you
gave
me,
requires
me
to
indulge
the
assumption,
they
will
be
excluded
when
political
conditions
change
in
cuba.
i
do
not
think
that
i
can
agree
with
that
assumption.i
do
not
think
that
mr.
diaz
who
is
80
years
old
and
that
mr.
clara
are
going
to
be
excluded
from
the
country,
if
the
castro
regime
falls
in
cuba.
i
just
do
not
think
that
it
is
a
practical
matter.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
do
not
know
that
but
–
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
agree
but
as
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
is
whether
not
they
are
here
temporarily
and
are
going
to
be
excluded
and
i
cannot
agree
that
i
know
that
they
will
be
excluded.
my
point
is
they
are
here,
their
home
is
here,
their
ties
are
here
and
if
we
take
the
government's
submission
to
the
court
as
being
the
proper
one
that
the
government
is
requiring
some
ties.
these
people
have
the
ties.
now,
i
must
say
that,
that
is
only
one
part,
there
are
two
classes
involved
here.
there
are
aliens
who
have
not
been
here
for
five
years
who
are
not
in
the
same
category
as
mrs.
diaz
and
clara.
i
think
that
all
of
these
people
are
entitled
to
the
constitutional
protections
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
i
think
that
when
one
looks
at
graham
versus
richardson,
the
reason
why
they
are
entitled
to
it
becomes
obvious.
because
these
people
who
are
in
the
country
under
color
of
law
are
the
prime
example
of
a
discreet
and
insolent
minority.
that
is
the
suspect
classification
test.
we
think
the
suspect
classification
test
is
right.
we
think
that
is
one
that
should
be
applied
to
this
group
of
aliens.
and
mr.
bork
this
morning,
i
think
tried
to
frighten
the
court
away
from
adopting
the
suspect
classification
test
by
saying
that
all
of
these
statutes
listed
in
his
appendix
to
the
wong
brief
might
then
fall.
i
think
mr.
bork
was
wrong
and
i
think
mr.
bork’s
fears
that
were
unfounded.
many
of
those
statutes
maybe
justified
as
exercises
of
the
power
over
foreign
affairs,
as
exercises
of
power
to
protect
national
security,
as
exercises
of
the
power
to
protect
vital
resources
and
so
i
do
not
think
that
utilizing
suspect
classification
will
result
a
fortiori
in
the
destruction
of
the
constitutionality
of
those
statutes.
now,
even
if
the
rational
basis
test
is
the
test
that
ought
to
be
used
in
this
case.
we
think
that
these
statutory
classifications
do
not
pass
constitutional
master.
weinberger
versus
salfi
has
been
cited
this
afternoon
and
weinberger
versus
salfi
is
the
case,
the
most
recent
case,
which
talks
about
the
rational
basis
test
and
how
it
is
utilized.
and
i
think
that
when
one
looks
at
weinberger
versus
salfi
and
compares
it
to
this
case.
one
sees
why
the
statutory
residents
requirements
here
fall
and
they
did
not
fall
in
salfi.
for
instance
in
salfi,
there
was
a
long
legislative
history,
which
show
that
congress
was
concerned
with
abuses
of
the
social
security
system
that
resulted
from
sham
marriages.
salfi
involved
the
duration
of
relationship
requirement.
one
had
to
be
married
for
nine
months
in
order
to
secure
a
social
security
benefits
if
one's
spouse
died.
there
was
a
presumption
that
if
you
are
married
for
more
than
nine
months.
it
was
not
a
marriage
entered
into,
for
the
purpose
of
securing
those
benefits.
so
there
is
that
long
legislative
history
that
there
had
been
–
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
my
impression
form
your
opinion
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
you
certainly
found
that
there
was
much
testimony
in
the
congressional
hearings
that
there
had
been
abuses
and
people
were
entering
into
sham
marriages.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
no
matter
how
long
it
was,
there
was
a
legislative
history
that
showed
there
were
abuses
and
congress
was
seeking
to
protect
the
system
against
those
abuses.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
say
that
because
in
every
case,
the
court
has
looked
to
see
if
there
is
some
way
to
conclude
that
congress
had
some
concern.
i
am
not
saying
that
congress
must
have
manifested
it
by
coming
out
with
a
long
preamble
to
a
statute
which
says
this
is
why
we
did
it.
but
there
must
be
something
in
the
record
that
justifies
the
congressional
classification.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mcgowan
versus
maryland
as
i
recall
is
a
sunday
closing
law
case
and
one
distinction
that
i
would
make
between
mcgowan
versus
maryland
is
that,
one,
we
have
a
little
different
--
two
different
things
to
consider
here.
one
is
that
there
are
people,
aliens,
a
class
that
is
affected
and
it
is
not
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
was
being
affected
in
mcgowan
versus
maryland
–
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
see
the
difficulties
in
taking
that
position,
but
quite
candidly,
i
think
that
there
must
be,
the
rational
basis
is
not
a
very
précised
test.
one
cannot
apply
it
mechanically
to
everything.
i
think
one
must
take
into
consideration
the
factors
that
come
into
play
and
i
think
yes,
the
fact
that
there
are
people
involved
here
and
there
are
aliens.
and
the
fact
that
their
important
health
care
benefits
involved
here
that
maybe
essential
to
the
very
life
of
those
people.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
they
are
not
less
people
but
they
do
not
form
a
class
that
this
court
has
in
the
past
looked
at
very
carefully,
whenever
legislation
has
been
implemented
to
dealing
it.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
agree,
but
i
think
that
ones
want
to
recedes,
if
the
court
says
it
is
not
a
suspect
classification.
i
still
think
there
can
be
some
heightened
judicial
solicit
to
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
that
they
could
shop
another
days
other
than
sunday
and
so
the
harm
that
befalls
them
is
perhaps
not
a
substantial
as
those
who
were
denied
important
health
care
benefits
when
they
are
over
65
and
need
those
benefits
in
order
to
protect
their
very
life.
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
for
there
maybe
a
number
of
people.
i
do
not
know
how
substantial
mr.
chief
justice
but
once
again,
i
do
not
think
–
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
it
is.
i
think
the
purpose
of
that
obviously
is
not
only
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
those
people.
but
the
economic
needs
of
the
supermarkets.
when
one
looks
again
at
salfi
and
i
think
salfi
is
very
important
in
making
our
argument
here.
in
salfi,
there
were
other
objective
evidences
which
could
be
shown
to
avoid
the
presumption
that
the
marriage
was
not
a
sham.
that
does
not
appear
in
this
case
at
all.
in
other
words,
in
salfi
if
a
person
had
children
by
the
marriage
or
had
adopted
children
by
the
marriage,
no
matter
how
short
how
may
have
been
before
the
death
of
the
spouse.
then
there
was
a
way
around
that
irrebuttable
presumption
is
salfi.
in
this
case,
there
is
not
way
around
it.
people
who
do
have
ties
to
the
country,
people
who
have
come
here
have
to
wait
five
years
no
matter
how
strong
ties
are
to
the
country
and
so
once
again,
we
have
an
example
that
congress
has
not
really
been
very
precise
in
trying
to
meet
the
legitimate
legislative
goals
that
maybe
involved.
and
one
final
example
of
the
preciseness
in
salfi,
which
i
believe
that
this
court
to
uphold
the
statute
in
salfi,
is
that
congress
had
reduced
the
requirement,
the
marriage
requirement
from
one
year
to
nine
months.
because
there
had
been
evidence
that
some
people
who
have
been
married
for
more
than
nine
months
but
less
than
a
year
were
being
excluded
from
social
security
benefits
even
though
the
marriages
were
not
sham.
another
example
of
congress
trying
to
be
precise
and
while
it
has
power
to
draw
lines.
the
court
looked
at
that
power
and
said
the
power
was
exercised
in
a
very
precise
and
definite
way
and
the
lines
that
were
drawn
were
not
irrational.
we
think
that
using
that
analysis
and
applying
it
to
this
case,
one
must
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
lines
are
far
too
broad.
cut
much
too
harshly
and
are
therefore,
irrational.
the
argument
we
make
which
is
an
argument
really
based
upon
the
–
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
mr.
justice
stevens.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
the
six
month
requirement
was
much
more
difficult
for
me
to
try
to
overcome.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes
i
think.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
we
would
then
be
able
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
line
was
drawn
with
some
concern
for
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
entitled
to
those
benefits.
requiring
thirty
days
for
instance,
would
perhaps
show
that
congress
was
trying
to
draw
a
fine
line
so
that
it
would
not
harm
people
who
were
elderly
who
would
come
to
this
country
lawfully
and
were
indeed
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is
right
mr.
justice
stevens
and
in
salfi,
there
were
some
people
who
obviously
were
married
less
than
nine
months
but
were
still
going
to
be
precluded.
congress
does
not
have
to
meet
every
need
of
every
person
but
it
must
at
least
draw
a
line
in
a
narrow
way
so
that
it
does
not
engage
in
the
whole
sale
kind
of
exclusions
which
are
here.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
am
not
happy
with
thirty-days.
i
mean,
i
would
have
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
in
standing
before
the
court
and
objecting
to
the
thirty-day
requirement.
i
think
there
is
another
way
that
could
accomplish
the
purpose
or
just
would
be
for
congress
to
do
but
for
instance,
one
could
draw
the
line
between
--
one
could
draw
the
line
at
those
listed
in
the
non-immigrant
category
under
immigration
law,
which
by
definition
would
exclude
all
of
those
temporary
people.
but
if
instead
congress
drew
the
line
at
thirty-days,
i
would
then
have
to
say
that
in
thirty-days
of
course,
you
probably
could
not
even
get
enrolled
within
thirty-day
period
so
that
might
not
be
such
a
bad
luck.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
within
one
day
of
being
admitted,
they
become
persons.
yes
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
argument
we
are
making
is
not
–
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
certainly
believe
mr.
chief
justice
that
a
person
who
immigrates
to
this
country.
who
on
the
moment
he
leaves
ellis
island
and
steps
into
new
york
for
instance
and
says
i
have
cut
off
all
ties
with
my
homeland
and
this
is
my
new
land
and
i
will
make
it
my
only
land
for
the
rest
of
my
life.
that
person
has
substantial
and
enduring
ties,
does
congress
have
to
draw
the
line
there
if—it
would
be
nice
of
they
did.
it
would
most
accurately
reflect
what
the
purpose
that
the
government
is
suggesting
is.
but
if
it
did
not
draw
the
line
quite
there,
i
would
not
be
able
to
say
it
would
totally
irrational
and
of
course,
all
of
this
discussion
is
premised
on
the
assumption
that
irrational
basis
test
is
appropriate
one
and
not
the
compelling
interest
test,
the
point
which
i
do
not
of
course
agree
with.
the
argument
we
are
making
is
not
a
novel
one.
in
1886,
in
yick
wo
versus
hopkins,
the
court
held
that
aliens
were
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
1896,
in
wong
wing
versus
united
states,
the
court
held
that
aliens
were
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
fifth
amendment.
our
argument
is
the
amalgam
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifth
amendments
and
we
are
saying
that
aliens
today
ought
to
be
entitled
to
the
constitutions
just
as
aliens
of
a
past
century
that
were
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
the
constitution.
and
we
believe
that
the
cases
that
this
court
has
decided
recently
dealing
with
aliens
are
most
persuasive
in
affirming
the
decision
of
the
court
below.
