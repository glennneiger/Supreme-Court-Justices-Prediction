ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court?
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
by
the
government
from
a
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
florida.
like
the
previous
case,
it
involves
the
challenge
to
the
federal
government's
power
to
classify
on
the
basis
of
alienage.
the
appellees
are
three
aliens
who
wish
to
enroll
in
a
subsidized
federal
medical
insurance
program
for
the
elderly.
this
program
is
part
of
the
overall
social
security
insurance
system
for
people
over
65.
that
system
consists
of
three
parts.
first,
there
is
the
basic
retirement
insurance
which
is
old
age
and
survivors
insurance.
eligibility
for
that
insurance
is
based
on
age
and
work
in
covered
employment.
citizenship
or
alienage
has
almost
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
almost
all
employment
in
this
country
is
covered.
second,
there's
hospital
--
hospitalization
insurance
which
is
referred
to
us
medicare
part
a
and
eligibility
is
based
primarily
on
entitlement
to
the
basic
retirement
insurance.
the
third
category
is
the
one
involved
in
this
litigation
and
that
is
medicare
part
b,
supplemental
medical
insurance.
part
b
is
a
voluntary
program.
those
who
enroll
who
currently
pay
$6.70
a
month
which
the
government
matches.
the
fund
created
by
these
contributions
pays
80%
of
covered
medical
expenses
and
they're
mainly
doctor's
fees
and
medication.
appellees
are
all
over
65.
they
want
to
enroll
in
medicare
sub
part
b
but
they
were
refused
because
part
b
insurance
is
available
only
to
persons
who
are
eligible
for
part
a
insurance
to
citizens
or
to
aliens
admitted
for
permanent
residence
who
have
actually
been
residents
for
five
years.
all
three
named
appellees
entered
this
country
in
1971.
so
they
don't
need
the
five-year
residence
requirement.
in
addition,
two
of
the
appellees
were
admitted
under
the
special
cuban
refugee
program
and
not
for
permanent
residents.
so
on
that
ground
also,
they're
ineligible
for
medicare
part
b.
the
cuban
program
does
not
--
does
permit
a
retroactive
adjustment
of
status.
so
that
by
the
time
these
two
appellees
have
been
here
for
five
years,
they
probably
will
be
eligible
for
medicare
part
b
since
their
status
will
have
been
adjusted
to
that
of
permanent
resident
aliens.
this
is
a
class
action
and
the
court
below
defined
the
class
as
all
immigrants
denied
enrollment
in
sub
part
b
because
they're
not
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residents
and
have
not
met
the
five-year
residency
requirement.
it
also
established
a
sub
class
represented
by
single
appellee,
espinosa
of
those
denied
benefits
solely
because
they
could
not
meet
the
durational
residence
requirement.
the
court
held
that
the
durational
residence
requirement
denied
appellees
equal
protection
because
it
did
--
it
was
not
rationally
related
to
any
valid
congressional
purpose.
it
also
held
that
the
durational
residence
requirement
was
not
separable
from
the
requirement
that
the
alien
be
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
and
therefore,
it
struck
all
the
aliage
provisions
from
the
medicare
sub
part
b
eligibility
provisions.
we've
discussed
the
separability
issue
in
our
brief
and
i
don't
propose
to
discuss
that
further
this
afternoon.
it
is
our
contention
here
as
it
was
in
the
preceding
case
that
equal
protection
analysis
is
simply
inappropriate
when
considering
federal
statutes
dealing
with
alienage
in
view
of
the
basis
and
extent
of
congress'
broad
powers
over
immigration.
solicitor
general
presented
that
view
this
morning
and
i
don't
propose
to
go
into
that
again.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
the
medicare
eligibility
provision
at
issue
here
is
closely
related
to
immigration
policy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
below
rather
surprisingly
indicated
that
it
had
doubts
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
admitted
for
permanent
residence
requirement
for
part
of
the
statute
precisely
because
it
was
so
closely
related
to
the
policy
expressed
in
the
immigration
act.
the
immigration
act
provides
that
one
of
the
qualifications
for
admission
as
an
immigrant
is
that
the
applicant
not
be
likely
to
become
a
public
charge.
now
the
practical
effect
of
that
requirement
particularly
for
people
over
60,
are
the
only
ones
that
are
affected
by
this
medicare
provision
is
that
they
must
either
be
economically
independent
or
have
someone
in
this
country
who
is
willing
to
assume
responsibility
for
their
support.
the
medicare
limitation
simply
defines
the
extent
of
the
support
obligation.
the
effect
of
the
immigration
statute
and
the
medicare
statute
taken
together
is
the
same
as
if
congress
had
explicitly
provided
in
the
immigration
act
that
elderly
immigrants
must
undertake
to
provide
for
their
own
medical
needs
for
five
years
after
they
enter
either
by
private
insurance
or
by
having
the
financial
capability
of
doing
it
independently
of
insurance.
congress
could
certainly
have
done
--
made
that
provision
directly
in
the
immigration
act.
we
submit
that
congress
has
an
equal
right
to
do
it
indirectly
through
the
medicare
act.
it's
the
essence
of
congressional
power
over
immigration
to
decide
which
groups
it
will
encourage
to
immigrate,
and
which
discourage
and
also
to
decide
how
much
encouragement
it
will
offer.
an
elderly
person
considering
immigration
will
normally
consider
the
cost
of
living
in
this
country.
part
of
that
cost
is
the
cost
medical
care.
if
subsidized
government
insurance
is
available,
the
cost
will
be
lower
than
if
it
is
not
and
if
it's
available
after
five
years,
the
cost
is
less
than
if
it's
not
available
at
all.
immigration
is
thus
encouraged
by
making
the
insurance
available,
but
it's
not
encouraged
as
much
as
it
would
be
if
the
insurance
was
available
immediately
on
entry.
congressional
judgments
concerning
immigration
policy
are
entitled
to
great
judicial
deference.
this
medicare
eligibility
provision
is
an
expression
of
congressional
immigration
policy
and
as
such
it's
entitled
to
great
judicial
deference.
for
that
reason,
even
if
this
judgment
is
subject
to
review
on
equal
protection
grounds,
the
court
need
do
no
more
than
assure
itself
that
there's
a
rational
justification
for
the
restrictions
on
alien
eligibility
and
there
is
such
a
justification
in
this
case.
the
part
b
medicare
program
is
part
of
the
overall
social
security
insurance
program.
that
program
is
not
basically
a
welfare
program
in
which
payments
are
based
on
current
needs.
there's
no
means
test
for
eligibility.
instead,
the
insurance
is
available
to
those
to
whom
congress
has
determined
that
the
country
owes
an
obligation.
this
court
has
in
fact
recognized
that
that
sense
of
obligation
is
the
basis
of
the
original
social
security
program
which
is
of
course
the
root
stock
of
the
whole
federal
social
insurance
program
particularly
for
the
elderly.
if
i
may
quote
from
flemming
v.
nestor,
the
program
is
based
on
a
legislative
judgment
that
those
who
in
their
productive
years
were
functioning
members
of
the
economy
may
just
call
on
that
economy
in
their
later
years
for
protection
from
the
rigors
of
the
poor
house.
in
setting
up
the
part
b
eligibility
provisions,
congress
went
somewhat
further.
it
extended
the
benefits
to
all
citizens
and
to
aliens
with
a
substantial
relation
to
this
country
but
the
theory
remained
the
same.
congress
simply
recognized
that
resident
aliens
like
citizens
pay
taxes
are
subject
to
military
service
and
contribute
in
myriad
other
ways
to
our
national
community.
citizens,
who
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
cases
make
these
contributions
throughout
their
lives,
may
not
enroll
in
sub
part
b
until
they're
65.
an
alien,
who
makes
his
myriad
contributions
in
his
country
of
origin
during
his
working
life
may
retire
and
come
here
and
after
only
five
years
of
contributing
to
this
community,
he's
eligible
to
enroll
in
medicare
sub
part
b
on
the
same
basis
as
a
citizen.
that's
not
certainly
an
unreasonable
discrimination
against
the
alien.
in
fact,
the
only
person
is
more
favorably
treated
would
be
a
us
citizen
who
had
never
lived
in
this
country
and
then
returned
in
his
old
age
and
was
immediately
eligible
for
the
medicare
sub
part
b
and
that
i
submit
is
such
a
small
group
that
its
really
diminimous.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
because
the
principle
there
is
that
he
has
been
a
participating
member
of
his
community.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
not
of
a
social
security
program,
but
my
point
is
that
he
has
been
living
here
and
he
has
been
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
--
subject
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
with
the
theory
of
the
act
is
that
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
he
has
been
living
here,
he
has
been
contributing
as
a
member
of
the
community.
congress
decided
that
five
years
of
participation
in
the
national
community
is
enough
for
eligibility
for
medicare
part
b.
it
could
have
made
the
period
longer
or
it
could
have
made
it
shorter
that
drew
the
line
at
five
years.
under
traditional
equal
protection
analysis,
this
court
should
not
decide
whether
that
was
the
best
place
to
draw
the
line.
the
line
is
however,
consistent
with
the
immigration
act
which
also
uses
five
years
as
the
period
in
which
the
alien
is
in
some
way
is
here
on
probation.
his
native
country
remains
more
responsible
for
him
during
that
period
than
it
is
after
five
years.
for
example,
he
ordinarily
can't
be
--
can
be
deported
for
indigency
within
five
years
or
for
a
single
crime
which
involves
interpretive
committed
within
that
time.
of
course
too,
he
may
not
ordinarily
be
naturalized
until
he
has
been
here
for
five
years.
so
that
until
that
time,
there
can't
be
no
full
assumption
of
the
rights
of
citizenship
nor
total
disillusion
of
the
bond
with
his
native
country.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
distinction
between
citizens
and
aliens
in
the
medicare
program
is
not
unreasonable.
it
also
serves
the
rational
fiscal
purpose
of
reducing
the
amount
of
the
federal
subsidy
required
for
the
program.
court
below
thought
that
the
government
did
not
benefit
financially
from
postponing
the
eligibility
of
aliens
except
to
the
extent
that
they
die.
it
made
two
assumptions
not
supported
by
the
record.
first,
it
assumed
that
no
elderly
aliens
returned
to
their
native
country
before
five
years
are
up.
and
second,
that
they
postponed
needed
care
which
it
further
assumed
made
the
eventual
cost
to
the
government
of
the
insurance
as
great
as
if
they
were
eligible
immediately.
the
immigration
service
does
not
have
records
of
how
many
elderly
immigrants
leave
the
country
within
five
years
and
the
second
assumption
is
pure
speculation.
of
course
if
it's
true,
it's
equally
irrational
to
deny
benefits
to
those
have
not
yet
reached
65
because
they
too
will
postpone
necessary
care
which
could
have
been
provided
more
cheaply
before
they
reach
65.
anyway,
we
submit
that
these
are
certainly
legislative
judgments.
this
is
a
novel
program
which
has
been
under
constant
legislative
review
and
it
is
up
to
congress
to
evaluate
all
these
factors
and
decide
whether
and
how
much
to
liberalize
eligibility
for
medicare.
i
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i'm
sorry
i
don't.
all
i
wanted
to
emphasize
once
that
congress
has
drawn
lots
of
lines
in
establishing
immigration
policy.
the
cuban
parolees
are
parolees
general,
are
admitted
on
a
temporary
basis
and
they
are
not
considered
to
establish
permanent
residence.
the
medicare
provisions
which
included
this
immigration
policy
went
into
affect
in
1966
and
these
aliens
came
in,
in
1971.
on
the
basis
of
the
policy
that
was
established
in
1966
so
that
when
they
entered
and
they
entered
under
the
conditions
that
had
--
were
in
effect
then
in
medicare
act
as
well
in
the
immigration
act.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
this
is
certainly
it's
a
--
what's
involved
here
is
subject
by
the
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
is
one
of
the
conditions
under
which
these
people
were
admitted,
and
after
five
years
they
would
be
entitled.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well
the
basic
principle
is
that
after
they've
been
for
five
years,
they
have
made
the
contribution
or
as
--
as
they've
been
here
for
long
enough
so
that
it's
rational
to
assume
that
they
have
that
kind
of
a
connection
that
it's
appropriate
for
them
to
be
entitled
to
this
insurance.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
by
the
government
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
florida.
like
the
preceding
case,
it
involves
the
challenge
to
the
federal
government’s
power
to
classify
on
the
basis
of
alienage.
but
this
case
challenges
an
illegitimate
classification,
which
limits
eligibility
to
a
federal
health
insurance
program
for
the
elderly,
medicare
part
b
or
supplementary
medicare
and
medical
insurance.
part
b
is
part
of
the
social
security
system.
the
major
part
of
that
system
is
of
course
old
age
and
survivor's
insurance.
eligibility
for
those
benefits
depends
on
age
and
past
work
and
covered
employment.
it
is
equally
available
to
aliens
and
citizens.
this
basic
retirement
insurance
is
supplemented
by
medicare
parts
a,
b.
part
a
provides
hospitalization
insurance,
and
b
provides
insurance
covering
certain
other
medical
costs
such
as
doctor’s
fees
and
medicines.
since
part
a
and
b
were
intended
to
supplement
the
basic
retirement
systems,
both
are
made
available
to
anyone,
alien
or
citizen
who
is
entitled
to
social
security
benefits
or
indeed
to
railroad
retirement
benefits.
appellees’
complaint
is
that
they
are
denied
equal
protection
because
sub
part
b
is
also
available
to
citizens
without
regard
to
their
work
and
covered
employment,
but
to
non-covered
aliens,
only
if
they
have
been
admitted
for
permanent
residence
and
lived
her
for
five-years.
our
principle
answer
to
that
complaint
is
that
equal
protection
analysis
is
simply
not
relevant
in
considering
the
constitutional
nullity
of
federal
statutes,
which
distinguish
between
citizens
and
aliens
in
their
status
as
aliens.
and
if
equal
protection
analysis
is
relevant
at
all,
the
scope
of
judicial
view
in
this
case
is
extra
ordinarily
limited.
certainly,
no
more
than
the
traditional
rational
basis
test
is
appropriate.
our
arguments
along
these
lines
were
thoroughly
discussed
this
morning
and
i
do
not
plan
to
go
over
that
ground
again.
instead,
i
would
like
to
focus
on
the
medicare
statute
and
show
that
if
a
rational
basis
test
is
to
be
applied,
the
statute
is
clearly
constitutional.
but
first,
i
want
to
speak
briefly
of
the
jurisdictional
issues
in
light
of
this
court’s
recent
decision
in
weinberger
versus
salfi.
the
appellees
are
three
aliens
who
brought
this
suit
as
a
class
action
to
challenge
the
secretary’s
refusal
to
enroll
them
in
medicare
part
b.
clara
and
diaz
are
cuban
refugees
who
are
allowed
to
enter
the
country
in
1971
under
special
immigration
act
provision
permitting
the
temporary
entry
of
people
in
emergencies.
they
are
thus
parolees
and
have
not
under
the
specific
terms
of
the
immigration
act
been
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
espinosa
is
a
colombian
who
was
admitted
for
permanent
residence
in
june
of
1971,
thus,
none
of
the
appellees
are
entitled
to
enroll
simply
on
the
basis
of
their
residence
in
this
country,
as
they
would
be
if
they
were
citizens.
clara
and
diaz
applied
for
enrollment.
they
were
denied.
without
asking
for
a
rehearing,
they
brought
this
suit
for
judicial
review
of
the
denial,
claiming
jurisdiction
under
42
u.s.c
405
(g).
this
of
course
is
the
same
jurisdictional
basis
at
it
was
involved
in
salfi.
espinosa
joined
the
suit
and
then
filed
a
claim.
the
three-judge
district
court
found
that
the
administrative
exhaustion
required
by
405
(g)
would
be
futile.
it
then
certified
as
a
class,
all
immigrants
who
have
been
or
will
be
denied
enrollment
in
sub-part
b
because
they
are
not
aliens
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
who
have
lived
here
for
five-years.
the
court
also
established
subclass,
which
was
represented
only
by
the
appellee
espinosa
consisting
of
those
who
have
been
or
will
be
denied
enrollment
solely
because
of
their
failure
to
meet
the
five-year
residence
requirement.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
necessarily
because
it
had
included
those
who
will
be
denied.
there
is
no,
because
that
was
before
salfi,
there
was
no
indication.
the
district
court
then
held
the
entire
alien
eligibility
requirement
for
medicare
part
b
unconstitutional
and
it
permanently
enjoined
the
secretary
from
relying
on
that
requirement
to
deny
enrollment
to
the
class
members
and
after
a
short
stay,
the
order
became
effective
in
august
1973.
so,
the
entire
class
was
enrolled
and
has
been
insured
since
that
time.
as
in
salfi,
there
was
no
allegation
that
the
class
members
had
even
filed
an
application
with
the
secretary
much
less
that
he
had
not
rendered
any
decision
filing
or
otherwise,
review
of
which
was
sought.
thus,
as
in
salfi,
the
class
was
improper.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
record
does
not
show
--.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
there
certainly
could
have
been,
but
there
certainly
was
no
--
the
district
court
made
the
determination
themselves
that
itself
that
further
review
by
the
secretary
would
have
been
futile
and
salfi
indicates
that
the
secretary
must
make
that
determination.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
do
not
really
think
that
the
class
issue
is
a
problem
in
this
case.
for
one
thing,
because
there
was
no
stay,
the
class
members
have
been
being
paid
or
have
been
enrolled
and
of
course,
the
decision
of
this
court,
because
this
court
has
jurisdiction
because
the
district
court
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
same
ways
as
it
was
in
salfi.
the
secretary
has
determined
as
in
salfi
again
that
there
was
jurisdiction
because
there
was
a
final
decision
over
clara
and
diaz,
it
was
final
administrative
determination
as
to
clara
and
diaz
and
this
court’s
determination
will
bind
the
secretary
for
the
future
as
to
everybody.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
right.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes.
well.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
as
to
those
two.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
i
do
not
think
that
we
object
so
much
to
the
form
of
the
order
if
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
as
to
those
two
then
they
properly
enrolled
and
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
injunction
is
to
his
enforcing
it
specifically
against
the
class
members.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
as
a
practical
matter,
it
does
not
really
make
any
difference
in
this
particular
case.
our
main
point,
i
suppose
on
the
class
action
aspect
is,
that
the
error,
because
the
order
was
not
stated,
the
error
has
cost
the
government
about
$2
million,
something
over
$2
million
for
1975
alone,
but
essentially
that
is
water
over
the
dam
at
this
point.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
way
that
figure
was
arrived
at,
the
government
pays
$750.00
a
month
in
premiums
to
match
the
$670.00
a
month
that
is
paid
by
each
alien.
and
then
at
end
of
the
year,
the
government
makes-up
any
deficit
in
trust
fund
that
applies
to
this
particular
program
and
the
total
cost
of
both
benefits
and
the
premium
payments
and
the
make-up
is
$10.00
each.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
is
the
statute.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
that
is
by
virtue
of
his
enrollment.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
class
definition
is
on
page
50
and
51
of
the
appendix
and
it
includes
all
immigrants
residing
in
the
united
states
who
have
attained
the
age
of
65
and
who
have
been
or
will
be
denied
enrollment
in
the
supplemental
medical
insurance
program.
so
it
does
not
say
anything
about
when
they
have
been
denied.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
nothing
about
that,
no.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
we
think
that
the
class
was
improper,
yes
on
that
ground.
what
happened
after
the
state
was
dissolved,
was
that
the
social
security,
i
mean
atw
paid
under
the
order
everybody
whose
applications
were
in
the
pipeline
at
that
time.
they
did
not
go
back
and
pick-up
people
who
had
been
denied
more
than
60
days
before.
i
think
when
you
are
thinking
about
the
retro-activity
issue
here
and
the
whole
class
action
issue,
it
is
kind
of
important
to
remember
that
what
is
involved
here
is
an
application
and
then
payment
of
a
premium
by
the
applicant
and
insurance
from
that
point
forward.
so
that
to
go
back
and
say
when
you
enrolled
and
we
denied
you
but
we
are
going
to
reopen
it
and
then
you
have
to
pay
us
the
monthly
premiums
and
we
get
insurance
for
period
when
you
may
or
may
not
had
been
sick.
it
is
rather
peculiar
kind
of
a
retro-activity
problem.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
not
unless
i
have
been
sick.
the
situation
as
to
espinosa
is
little
more
complicated.
he
did
not
apply
for
enrollment
until
after
he
joined
the
suit.
because
of
the
litigation
and
the
district
court's
injunction
against
denying
him
enrollment,
his
application
has
in
fact
never
been
adjudicated.
it
is
rather
hard
to
see
how
there
kind
have
been
a
final
decision
as
to
him
for
meeting
review
under
405
(g).
but
the
appellees
point
out
that
the
secretary
has
nevertheless
in
effect
stipulated
that
his
claim
had
been
finally
denied.
that
may
not
be
an
entirely
accurate
reading
of
the
stipulation
originally
made.
but
we
do
agree
that
the
district
court
and
the
parties
assumed
before
salfi
that
espinosa’s
application
was
to
be
treated
as
if
it
had
been
finally
denied
by
the
secretary.
the
secretary
has
concluded
that
but
before
the
injunction,
the
application
would
have
been
denied
solely
because
of
espinosa’s
failure
to
meet
the
alien
inter
provisions.
as
a
technical
matter,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
stipulation
here
cures
the
lack
of
any
decision,
not
alone
and
a
final
one.
but
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case,
especially
the
fact
that
it
was
litigated
before
salfi
may
justify
reading
this
stipulation
liberally
and
concluding
that
the
secretary
has
now
foreclosed
from
denying
that
there
had
been
a
final
denial
of
espinosa’s
claim
sufficient
to
satisfy
405
(g).
perhaps
the
most
important
point
here
is
the
wisdom
of
salfi’s
emphasis
on
the
need
for
final
administrative
decision.
because
when
adjudication
of
espinosa’s
application
was
interrupted,
there
was
some
indication
that
he
was
entitled
to
enroll
because
he
had
worked
in
covered
employment.
in
fact,
he
had
not,
but
salfi
recognizes
that
405
(g)
and
h
protect
the
courts
from
being
asked
to
consider
constitutional
issues
until
that
kind
of
factual
question
has
been
finally
settled
administratively.
it
is
important
for
the
court
not
to
retreat
from
that
principle
here.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
it
is
jurisdictional.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
well,
the
record
on
the
stipulation
is
really
quite
unclear
and
it
is
hard
to
read
it
as
a
stipulation
that
there
has
been
a
final
denial
but
i
as
i
say,
i
think
that
it
could
perhaps
be
done.
and
we
would
not
object
in
this
case,
like
the
stipulation
in
that.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
no,
because
what
the
stipulation
--
what
we
would
be
doing
would
be
reading
the
stipulation
as
a
stipulation
that
there
was
a
final
decision.
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
yes,
yes.
i
turn
now
to
the
merits.
this
case
–
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
they
are
--
ms.
harriet
s.
shapiro
the
merits
are
either
in
clara
and
diaz
that
if
espinosa
is
out
of
the
case
then
you
have
somewhat
more
leeway
in
how
you
–
which
ones
of
the
various
issues,
there
are
that
you
can
attack,
you
can
decide
and
settle
the
case.
this
case
involves
both
an
alienage
classification
and
social
welfare
legislation.
the
solicitor
general
explained
this
morning,
why
we
believe
that
alienage
classifications
of
the
sort
involved
here
are
simply
not
subject
to
attack
on
equal
protection
grounds.
he
argued
alternatively,
if
they
are
subject
to
such
an
attack,
only
the
most
attenuated
rational
basis
test
is
appropriate.
and
a
narrow
rational
basis
test
is
also
appropriate
here
because
the
case
involves
social
welfare
legislation
and
salfi
is
the
most
recent
expression
of
that
principle.
in
that
connection,
i
want
only
to
emphasis
that
under
the
test
reaffirmed
in
salfi
and
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
this
morning.
this
court
need
not
consider
whether
the
asserted
justification
actually
motivated
congress
in
making
the
classification
nor
whether
a
different
classification
would
have
served
equally
well.
the
enrollment
limitations
here
are
rationally
related
to
both
legitimate
immigration
and
social
insurance
policies.
first,
it
is
rational
in
terms
of
both
policies
to
treat
aliens
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
differently
from
others
who
have
not
expressed
their
intent
to
remain
here
indefinitely
and
have
not
submitted
to
the
screening
necessary
to
establish
their
right
to
do
so.
that
distinction,
we
believe
is
self
evidently
reasonable
when
applied
to
most
non-immigrant
aliens.
people
like
illegal
entrants,
diplomats,
visitors,
members
of
cruise
of
foreign
ships.
certainly,
congress
is
not
constitutionally
required
to
provide
subsidized
medical
insurance
to
such
temporary
residents
in
this
country
just
because
it
does
so
for
citizens.
it
is
also
reasonable
for
congress
to
conclude
that
parolees
like
clara
and
diaz
should
be
treated
like
temporary
residents
until
they
have
been
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
they
were
given
refuge
in
this
country
without
prior
screening
because
of
emergency
conditions.
the
statute
under
which
they
entered
specifically
requires
their
return
to
the
country
from
which
they
came
when
the
emergency
ends.
they
apparently
wish
to
remain
here
permanently
since
they
have
applied
for
adjustment
of
their
status
to
that
of
permanent
immigrants,
permanent
resident
immigrants.
if
they
meet
immigration
standards,
their
status
will
be
adjusted
retroactive
to
the
time
at
which
they
entered.
but
until
that
has
been
done,
they
are
here
at
the
discretion
of
the
attorney
general
for
the
duration
of
the
emergency
and
thus
can
reasonably
be
considered
more
like
temporary
visitors
than
permanent
residents.
the
five-year
residents
requirement
is
also
a
rational
expression
of
immigration
policy.
it
is
the
essence
of
congressional
immigration
policy
to
decide
the
extent
to
which
immigration
will
be
encouraged.
a
person
considering
immigration
will
normally
consider
the
cost
of
living
in
this
country.
part
of
that
cost
is
the
cost
of
medical
care.
if
subsidized
government
insurance
is
available,
the
cost
will
be
lower
than
if
it
is
not.
if
it
is
available
after
five-years,
the
cost
is
less
than
if
it
is
not
available
at
all.
immigration
of
the
elderly
has
thus
encouraged
by
making
such
insurance
available
to
them
but
not
encouraged
as
much
as
if
it
were
available
immediately
on
entry.
even
more
explicitly,
the
immigration
act
expresses
the
policy
that
aliens
who
are
likely
to
become
public
chargers
are
not
to
be
admitted
as
immigrants.
the
practical
effect
of
that
requirement
for
immigrants
over
60
which
is
of
course
the
people
that
are
involved
in
the
medicare
eligibility
provision,
is
that
they
must
either
be
economically
independent
or
have
someone
here
who
will
assume
responsibility
for
their
support.
but
the
medicare
limitation
simply
defines
the
extent
of
that
support
obligation.
so
the
effect
of
the
immigration
statute
and
the
medicare
statute
together
is
the
same
as
if
congress
had
provided
explicitly
in
the
immigration
act
that
elderly
immigrants
must
undertake
to
provide
for
their
own
medical
care
for
five-years,
either
through
private
insurance
or
otherwise.
congress
could
certainly
have
done
that
directly
through
provisions
in
the
immigration
act.
congress
has
an
equal
right
to
do
it
indirectly
through
the
medicare
act.
we
believe
this
court
really
need
go
no
further
than
that
to
reject
the
petitioner’s
claims.
but
the
alien
eligibility
limitation
also
reflects
valid
social
welfare
policies.
the
fact
that
medicare
part
b
is
available
to
all
citizens
over
65
means
that
it
supplements
all
the
retirement
systems
in
the
country.
principally,
of
course
social
security,
also
the
railroad
retirements
act,
the
civil
service
and
even
the
military
retirement
provisions.
medicare
cannot
reasonably
be
considered
apart
from
the
systems,
all
our
programs
to
provide
for
the
elderly
in
their
retirement
years.
all
reflect
a
federal
responsibility
that
to
those
who
have
contributed
to
the
country
over
there
working
years.
all
are
based
in
part
on
the
individual
contributions
of
the
workers
and
impart
on
taxes.
since
medicare
part
b
supplements
all
of
them,
the
federal
contributions
reasonably
come
from
general
revenues
rather
than
from
taxes
on
individual
employers,
as
i
do
in
the
individual
systems.
in
any
case,
the
mechanics
of
funding
should
not
obscure
the
fact
that
what
is
involved
here
is
a
supplement
to
retirement
systems.
supplementary
medical
insurance
like
the
systems,
which
it
supplements,
is
made
available
in
recognition
of
past
contributions
to
the
economy.
it
is
perfectly
true
that
resident
aliens
like
citizens
pay
taxes
and
contribute
in
many
other
ways
to
our
economy.
citizens
ordinarily
do
so
over
their
working
lives
and
when
they
become
65,
they
may
enroll
in
medicare
part
b.
congress
concluded
that
an
alien
who
has
made
similar
contributions
for
only
five
years
may
also
enroll
in
medicare
part
b
at
65.
that
is
surely
is
not
discriminating
against
the
alien
in
the
allocation
of
tax
funds.
the
district
court
was
troubled
by
the
fact
that
chronically
indigent
citizens
who
may
never
have
paid
taxes
are
contributing
in
any
way
to
the
economy
are
entitled
to
medicare,
while
aliens
like
appellees
are
not.
there
are
two
answers
to
that
concern.
first,
as
salfi
reminds
us,
congress
may
use
broad
classifications
to
avoid
the
administrative
burden
of
case
by
case
determinations
of
eligibility.
since
entitlement
to
medicare
is
fundamentally
based
on
entirely
to
retirement
benefits
and
citizens
are
far
more
likely
to
meet
this
requirement
than
aliens
who
are
admitted
within
five
years
of
their
application.
it
is
reasonable
to
require
proof
of
eligibility
only
of
the
aliens
and
not
of
the
citizens,
even
currently
indigent
citizens.
but
there
is
another
justification
for
permitting
the
enrollment
of
indigent
citizens
and
not
recent
immigrants.
both
provisions
protect
state
welfare
funds.
the
enrollment
of
indigents
means
that
federal
funds
pay
medical
expenses,
the
states
would
otherwise
have
to
pay.
denial
of
medicare
to
recent
immigrants
discourages
the
entry
of
those
most
likely
to
become
state
charges.
the
fact
that
the
immigration
laws
have
the
same
effect
with
regard
to
the
immigrants
simply
means
that
the
two
acts
are
consistent.
it
certainly
does
not
mean
that
either
is
irrational.
appellees
emphasize
that
an
elderly
alien's
need
for
subsidize
medical
insurance
is
likely
to
be
as
great
as
that
of
an
elderly
citizen,
that
is
undoubtedly
true.
but
they
also
claim
that
the
only
purpose
of
medicare
part
b
is
to
provide
medical
insurance
to
those
who
need
it
and
that
is
not
true.
legislative
classifications
in
the
social
welfare
field
almost
always
are
the
result
of
many
considerations.
but
no
social
welfare
classification
can
be
made
without
balancing
needs
against
costs
and
these
will
vary
from
statute
to
statute.
this
of
course
means
that
the
classifications
made
will
vary
from
statute
to
statute.
for
instance,
in
the
program
providing
for
supplementary
federal
welfare
payments
for
elderly,
blind
and
disabled
indigents,
congress
provided
more
generously
for
aliens
than
it
did
in
the
medicare
statue,
and
there
it
included
all
aliens
who
are
in
this
country
under
color
of
law
that
the
needs
and
the
costs
that
were
being
evaluated
in
the
welfare
statute
that
issued
there
were
different.
and
so
a
different
balance
was
struck.
this
court
has
always
recognized
that
making
that
balance
is
a
legislative
function
not
to
be
disturbed
so
long
as
there
is
a
rational
justification
for
it.
here,
the
underlying
justification
is
that
the
needs
of
those
with
a
substantial
relation
to
the
country
are
recognized.
but
the
needs
of
those
whose
relationship
is
essentially
temporary
are
not.
congress
drew
a
line
which
is
reasonable
in
terms
of
that
justification.
the
district
court
is
changing
of
that
line
is
now
costing
the
government
over
2
million
dollars
annually.
and
that
price
would
probably
grow
up
in
the
future.
congress
frequently
reevaluates
medicare
and
it
may
someday
decide
that
appellees
needs
to
justify
that
burden
on
the
treasury.
it
has
not
done
so
yet
and
that
is
not
a
decision
for
this
court.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
