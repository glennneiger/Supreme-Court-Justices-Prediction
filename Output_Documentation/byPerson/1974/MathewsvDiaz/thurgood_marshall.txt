justice
thurgood
marshall
is
your
real
complaint
that,
he
is
designated
as
the
parolee
rather
than
resident
alien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
good
is
that
complaint
when
certainly
congress
has
a
right
on
this
immigration
laws
to
decide
which
is
which,
isn't
that
one
of
congress'
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
you
either
admit
them
as
the
resident
alien
or
parolee,
that's
the
right
of
immigration
and
naturalization?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
admit
that
your
complaint
is
that
he
is
a
parolee
rather
than
a
resident
alien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
was
a
resident
alien,
he
would
be
alright.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
your
complaint
is
that
when
he
was
admitted,
he
was
given
the
wrong
status?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
that
position
i
think
you're
in
a
whole
lot
of
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
feinberg
would
your
argument
cover
a
person
with
a
temporary
visa?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he's
an
alien?
justice
thurgood
marshall
not
without
the
immigrant
aliens.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
not
talking
about
the
law,
i
am
talking
about
your
position.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
position
is
that
these
immigrant
aliens
are
the
same
as
resident
aliens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
they
made
any
effort
to
change
the
status
to
resident
aliens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
they
made
any
effort
to
change
these
people
status
to
resident
aliens?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
isn't
close
to
the
visiting
visas?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
misled
by
your
argument
by
all
those
who
came
in,
in
president
eisenhower's
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
find
now,
you
are
arguing
about
those
who
came
in
last
week.
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
they
have
had
their
status
adjusted
by
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
they
haven't
been
here
long
enough,
because
this
is
just
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
all
this
argument
about
president
eisenhower
got
to
do
it
with
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
also
said
that
he
shall
not
legally
within
the
united
states.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
does
not
ordinarily
place
him
“legally”
within
the
united
states,
that
what
your
lower
court
decision
says.
