mr.
alfred
feinberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
mrs.
shapiro's
argument
rests
primarily
on
mr.
bork's
original
argument
which
was
that
the
fifth
amendment
notions
of
equal
protection
do
not
apply
to
aliens
or
if
that
is
true
and
that
is
what
this
court
holds,
then
i
think
this
case
falls
for
my
clients,
i
think
the
case
argued
previously
falls.
but
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
true
because
that
is
such
an
overwhelmingly
inconsistent
and
novel
argument
that
implicit
within
it
are
the
following.
that
a
classification
which
this
court
has
now
held
three
times
explicitly
ones
but
implicitly
two
other
times
and
many
other
courts
have
followed,
that
is
a
classification
of
aliens
is
not
inherently
suspect
when
that
classification
is
made
by
the
federal
government
rather
than
the
states.
two,
that
the
normal
test
of
whether
a
classification
is
justified
or
not
justified,
a
classification
involving
individual
work
as
opposed
to
classifications
involving
economics
and
taxes
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
here
with
individual
worth.
the
normal
test,
which
has
to
deal
with
the
relationship
of
the
classification
to
the
objective
of
the
statute
is
inapplicable
and
in
fact,
this
wasn't
even
spoken
about
here.
the
reason
it
wasn't
spoken
about
is
because
of
the
submission
by
the
government
to
this
court.
now,
twice
now
this
morning
that
the
federal
government
can
discriminate
against
aliens
as
aliens
in
any
way
they
see
fit.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
well,
i
think
mr.
bork's
argument
did
in
the
brief
that
was
filed
by
the
government
in
this
case.
the
argument
that
repeated
at
least
four
times
was
that
the
government
has
made
the
discrimination
in
this
case
against
aliens,
has
made
the
classification
in
this
case
against
aliens
and
indeed
in
virtually
all
of
those
statutes
which
are
listed
in
the
appendix
attached
to
the
one
brief.
the
government's
one
brief
because
the
aliens
have
not
shown
a
“substantial
and
enduring
connection
with
the
united
states
efficient
for
the
united
states
government
to
grant
them
the
benefits
that
are
granted
to
citizens
under
each
of
those
particular
provisions,”
the
one
we're
talking
about
here
are
medicare
b
provisions.
well,
the
substantial
and
enduring
connection
with
the
united
states
is
really
saying
aliens
when
you
compare
aliens
with
citizens,
citizens
have
an
absolute
and
enduring
connection
with
the
united
states.
so
those
who
do
not
have
relatives
to
citizens,
those
who
do
not
have
a
substantial
and
enduring
connection
with
the
united
sates
are
aliens.
now,
if
that's
the
basis
of
the
discrimination
and
it
is
asserted
repeatedly,
in
fact
that
is
headed
as
the
theme
of
the
discrimination.
the
theme
of
a
classifications
in
each
of
these
cases
is
that
the
underlying
theme,
i
think
the
words
are
used,
are
that
they
do
not
have
a
substantial
and
enduring
connection
with
the
united
states.
well
this
is
advancing
a
new
test
of
legislation
which
creates
classifications
because
the
test,
the
traditional
test
and
i'm
not
talking
about
the
test
now
that
is
used
for
suspect
classifications
or
with
or
fundamental
interest
involved
or
any
special
circumstances.
just
the
traditional
test
is
the
one
articulated
in
a
case
which
did
not
involve
a
suspect
classification.
it
involved
the
question
of
whether
a
conscientious
objector
could
receive
the
same
benefits
as
a
veteran
after
having
finished
his
conscientious
objector
service.
and
he
said
that
he
was
discriminated
against
because
he
serves
his
country
just
as
veterans
who
had
fought
in
the
war.
this
court
upheld
that
discrimination
and
that
classification
in
that
case
but
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
our
analysis
of
the
classification
proceeds
on
the
basis
that
although
an
individual's
right
to
equal
protection
of
the
law
does
not
deny
the
power
to
treat
different
classes
of
persons
in
different
ways,
it
denied
the
power
to
legislate
that
different
treatment
be
accorded
to
persons,
placed
by
statute
into
different
classes
on
the
basis
of
criteria
wholly
unrelated
to
the
objective
of
the
statute.
a
classification
must
be
reasonable,
not
arbitrary
and
must
rest
upon
some
ground
of
difference
having
a
fair
and
substantial
relation
to
the
object
of
the
legislation
so
that
all
persons
similarly
circumstanced
shall
be
treated
alike.
now,
here
we
are
told
that
there
is
a
new
test.
we
do
not
look
at
the
object
of
the
statute.
medicare,
the
object
of
the
statute
is
to
take
care
of
retirement
age
individuals,
medical
problems.
in
this
case
medicare
part
b,
it's
related
to
physician
services
generally,
arguably
some
argue
with
the
all
home
health
care
services,
dietary
services,
out
patient
services,
those
kind
of
services
are
the
kind
of
services
that
are
involved
in
medicare
part
b.
there
are
some
more
of
them,
but
you
can
get
the
idea
of
those
services.
to
distinguish
from
part
a
really
which
it
deals
with
hospitalization
benefit,
part
b
usually
talks
about
medical
benefits
which
are
doctor
services.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
that
is
correct
but
there
is
substantial
difference
in
the
way
they
are
funded
which
is
very
interesting.
part
b
is
funded
from
the
general
revenues
of
the
treasury
of
the
united
states,
that
is
the
tax
dollar.
that
is
the
money
that
comes
from
income
taxes
and
however
else
the
revenues
of
the
united
states
receive
its
moneys.
it
does
not
come
from
social
security
tax.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
matched,
yes.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
because
every
applicant
for
part
b
must
pay
a
premium
which
is
matched
by
the
treasury
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
from
the
general
revenue
funds,
that
is
correct.
and
so,
while
it
as
us
true
that
part
b
and
it
is
natural
that
part
b
should
fall
upon
part
a
and
it
is
called
the
medicare
program
and
it
is
within
the
preview
of
the
social
security
act
which
is
all
of
title
42
is
called
a
social
security
provision.
in
reality,
social
security
has
very
little
to
deal
with
it,
that
is
social
security
to
the
man
in
the
street.
it
has
to
do
with
somebody's
choosing
to
participate,
it's
a
voluntary
program.
somebody
who
is
65
years
old
choosing
to
seek
insurance
that
is
available
pursuant
to
congressional
enactment
for
which
a
premium
is
paid
by
the
applicant
and
a
like
premium
or
an
equal
or
part
of
the
premium
is
paid
by
the
tax
payers.
those
tax
payers
not
only
include
aliens,
but
the
children
of
aliens
and
anybody
related
to
aliens
who
are
living
in
the
united
states.
so
the
argument
that
an
alien
is
here
only
for
five
years
and
is
contributing
only
five
years,
it's
a
specious
argument,
particularly
when
we
will
look
at
--
and
the
problem
in
this
case
really
arose
definitionally.
the
classification
here
that
we're
talking
about
is
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
who
has
resided
in
the
united
states
continuously
during
the
five
years
immediately
proceeding
the
month
in
which
he
applies
for
the
benefits.
so
we
have
two
residency
requirements
here,
a
durational
residency
requirement
and
a
status
residency
requirement.
the
status
being
that
of
permanent
resident
and
forgetting
for
a
moment
about
the
durational
residency
requirement
which
was
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
going
to
the
question
of
the
status
residency
requirement
for
moment,
it
is
to
be
noted
that
the
problem
arises
because
of
the
nature
or
the
manner
in
which
cuban
refugees
were
allowed
to
come
in
to
the
united
states.
indeed
allowed
is
very
conservative
word.
those
of
us
who
have
lived
in
this
country
for
the
last
10
years
know
that
president
eisenhower
made
a
speech
in
which
he
beseeched
the
cubans
who
wanted
to
escape
from
castro's
cuba,
castro
taking
over
in
cuba
in
1959,
this
speech
was
made
i
believe
in
1961
to
come
in
to
the
united
states,
inducing
them
to
come
in
to
the
united
states,
so
the
point
where
we
started
sending
planes
during
the
1960's
to
pick
up
anybody
who
castro
would
allow
onto
those
planes
to
bring
them
into
the
united
states.
so
here
we
begged
these
people
to
come
in
to
the
united
states
and
thousands
and
thousands
and
thousands
of
them
came.
indeed
it
is
estimated
that
approximately
600
to
700,000
came.
and
of
those
numbers
approximately
250,000
to
300,000,
the
figures
were
inaccurate,
they
were
coming
in
such
great
numbers
that
they
were
overwhelming
the
agencies
that
were
taking
care
of
them
and
the
coming
from
miami,
florida
i
am
quite
familiar
with
the
chaos
that
was
caused
by
this
enormous
numbers
of
cubans
coming
in
to
the
community,
the
bureaucratic
problems
of
counting
them
for
example
and
analyzing
what
their
status
was
and
figuring
out
how
to
allow
them
into
the
united
states
under
the
then
current
laws
of
the
united
states
was
a
very
serious
problem.
at
the
beginning
when
they
were
trickling
in,
they
came
in
as
non-immigrants
and
when
their
non-immigrant
visa
run
out,
they
were
then
subject
to
deportation
proceedings.
during
the
deportation
proceedings,
they
claimed
political
asylum
and
it
was
granted
to
them.
this
was
a
very
cumbersome
process.
when
they
claimed
political
asylum,
they
became
immigrants.
once
they
became
immigrants,
they
qualified
for
the
medicare
part
b
provision
because
the
definition
of
immigrant
is
a
person
admitted
for
permanent
residence.
so
those
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
be
defined
as
immigrants
which
was
just
fortuitous,
depended
on
when
and
how
they
came
in
to
this
country
are
qualified
for
medicare
part
b,
but
as
the
numbers
increased
and
they
became
--
they
started
coming
in
by
the
thousands,
a
more
efficient
way
had
to
be
found
to
allow
them
to
come
in.
and
the
more
efficient
way
was
to
choose
to
allow
them
to
come
in
under
the
parole
powers
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
which
are
--
which
gave
the
attorney
general
the
power
to
allow
virtually
any
foreign
who
enter
the
united
states,
any
alien
into
the
united
states
under
any
conditions.
this
power
is
given
to
him
by
congress
and
it
is
very,
very
wide
and
broad
power,
a
wide
and
broad
power.
and
so
approximately
250
to
300,000
people
came
in.
now
the
problem
with
those
people
coming
in
is
what
brings
us
before
this
court
because
they
came
in
as
their
classification
was
parolee
and
a
parolee
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
is
neither
an
immigrant
nor
a
non-immigrant.
he
is
in
a
special
status
of
parolee
and
the
term
which
is
used
referring
now
to
the
status
term.
resident
--
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
does
not
cover
parolee,
at
the
historical
development
of
the
definition
of
that
term,
does
not
cover
parolees.
so
now
we
have
--
it's
estimated
by
the
lower
court
and
my
calculations
are
about
the
same
on
the
basis
of
these
sketchy
figures
that
we
have,
we
have
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
20,000
individuals
who
are
parolees.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
that
is
one
of
the
complaints.
if
he
was
designated
as
a
resident,
they
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
to
detriment
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
my
answer
to
that
is
that
i
have
a
two-fold
answer
to
that.
number
one,
that
you
must
--
when
that
classification
is
used
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
no.
my
complaint
is
that
the
classification
is
used
to
exclude
him
from
medicare
part
b,
that's
my
complaint.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
that's
one
part
of
it.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
right.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
that's
right.
the
complaint
is
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
not
the
wrong
status,
he
could
be
admitted
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
no,
that's
not
the
wrong
status.
he
could
have
been
in
neither
under
any
status.
the
question
is
what
they
did
with
that
status
after
he
was
admitted
and
i'm
submitting
to
the
court
that
the
status
of
parolee
does
not
fit
within
the
objective
and
purpose
of
medicare
part
b
which
is
the
task
of
the
classification.
now,
i
have
no
argument
with
him
being
a
parolee.
my
argument
is
utilizing
that
parolee
classification
to
deny
him
the
benefits
of
medicare
part
b.
what
is
the
relationship
between
taking
care
of
a
retirement
age
--
retirement
age
alien
who
resides
in
the
united
states
and
the
fact
that
he
is
a
parolee.
there
is
no
relationship.
the
only
relationship
is
that
he
is
an
alien
and
their
argument
is
a
circular
argument.
their
argument
is
he
is
an
alien
and
we
can
do
whatever
we
want
with
aliens
regardless
of
the
relationship
between
the
objective
of
the
statute
which
excludes
him
and
the
fact
that
he
is
an
alien.
those
two
are
facts,
one
that
a
person
whose
an
alien
or
is
a
parolee
or
it
has
any
condition
of
alienage
and
two
that
the
object
of
the
statute
is
to
take
care
of
individual's
medical
problems
when
they
are
--
reach
retirement
age
are
totally
unrelated
and
this
is
why
this
is
not
discussed
in
the
government's
brief
because
the
if
the
true
test
of
determining
whether
a
class
is
a
proper
classification,
a
classification
that
can
be
sustained
constitutionally
is
whether
it's
related
to
the
objective
of
the
statute,
we
find
that
the
classifying
aliens
are
totally
unrelated
to
the
objective
of
the
statute.
the
objective
of
the
statute
is
set
out
in
the
statute.
it's
taking
care
of
people's
medicals
problem
when
they're
65
years
old.
what
does
that
have
to
do
if
whether
somebody
is
a
citizen
or
an
alien?
that's
not
discussed
by
the
government
because
there
is
no
argument
that
can
be
made
relating
the
objective
of
the
statute
to
the
classification
that's
created.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
problem
that
has
brought
me
to
the
court
is
the
fact
they
have
utilized
the
parolee.
the
government
has
utilized
the
parolee
status
of
these
people
to
exclude
them
irrationally
and
arbitrarily
from
a
program
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
status
as
parolee
that's
like
excluding
garbage
man
or
policeman
or
plumbers.
there
--
it's
an
arbitrary
exclusions
from
the
statute
and
the
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
i
was
using
that
example
to
talk
about
the
arbitrariness.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
so-called
plenary
power
of
congress
that
has
to
do
with
the
aliens
must
be
related
in
this
argument
that
has
already
been
made
already,
must
be
related
to
naturalization,
deportation,
admittances
to
the
united
states
even
citizenship.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
yes
sir.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
i
don't
think
that
that
would
--
i
don't
think
would
be
provisional.
i
think
mr.
steinman
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
no
i
think
he
would
agree
with
that
completely.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
if
your
honor
please,
i
think
what
he
said
was
that
if
you
allowed
aliens
to
come
in
under
certain
conditions
that
he
might
question
those
conditions,
but
i
don't
think
he
would
challenge
a
statement
that
your
honor
has
just
made
and
that
is
that
the
united
states
simply
can
close
its
doors
to
aliens.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
i
don't
challenge
it
at
all,
i
think
united
states
certainly
can
close
its
doors
to
aliens
but
it
hasn't
and
it
hasn't
tied
these
conditions
to
naturalization
or
admittance
or
deportation.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
i
would
give
the
same
provisional
agreement
that
mr.
steinman
gave.
i
think
the
cases
that
have
been
before
this
court
where
such
as
flemming
versus
nestor
for
example
which
was
mentioned
by
my
worthy
opponent
where
you
tie
--
i
picked
that
case,
very
controversial
case
and
i
think
that's
a
four
to
three
decision
which
--
the
validity
of
which
has
been
questioned
through
the
years,
but
there
is
a
case
in
which
seemingly
very
arbitrary
exclusion
from
--
or
deportation
took
place
and
this
court
upheld
that.
well
that's
because
that
was
tied
to
deportation
and
that's
where
the
plenary
power
of
congress
comes
in,
deportation,
immigration
in
terms
of
naturalization.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
for
--
incidents
deportation.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
that
is
correct.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
yes,
that
he
was
a
deportee
and
they
said
when
he
got
deported
to
another
country,
he
would
lose
his
social
security
benefits,
but
it
was
tied
to
deportation
and
there
is
not
one
case,
not
one
of
all
of
these
cases
and
i've
read
them
all
carefully
that
is
cited
by
the
appellants
in
this
case
which
justifies
the
proposition,
are
imposing
conditions
upon
aliens
within
this
country
that
are
unconnected
with
naturalization
or
deportation
or
related
matters
such
as
national
sovereignty,
powers
of
citizenship.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
the
--
that's
tied
to
naturalization,
yes
sir.
they
say
that
if
you
come
into
this
country
as
an
indigent
then
you
have
violated
the
naturalization,
you've
committed
a
fraud
because
you
can't
come
in
to
this
country
as
indigent
unless
you
post
a
bond
but
that's
a
condition
on
naturalization.
i
am
agreeing
with
that
if
you
tie
to
a
condition
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
but
the
fact
to
the
matter
is
that
it
isn't.
they
have
not
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
there
is
nothing,
nothing
--
not
only
as
it
not
yet
there
in
literal
words
of
the
statute
which
were
in
the
social
security
act,
but
it
is
not
even
there
or
mentioned
in
the
legislative
history.
they
don't
talk
about
the
question
of
naturalization
or
admittance
into
this
country
or
anything
related
to
that
in
the
passage
of
this
provision
or
indeed
in
the
passage
of
most
of
the
acts
which
are
listed
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
one
brief.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
i
would
give
my
provisional
agreement
to
that,
that's
not
the
question
before
this
court.
the
test
of
the
constitutionality
again
are
relate
--
the
test
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
classification
is
related
to
the
object
of
the
benefit
conferred
by
the
legislation.
that's
been
the
traditional
test
that
this
court
has
used
time
and
time
again.
unrelated
to
the
fact
that
a
classification
maybe
inherently
suspect
which
we
have
here,
unrelated
to
the
fact
that
a
fundamental
right
is
involved
here
such
as
medical
care.
unrelated
to
any
of
those
matters.
the
traditional
and
consistent
test
has
been
whether
or
not
the
classification
is
related
to
the
object
or
purpose
of
the
statute
from
which
the
class
is
denied
benefits.
and
that
is
not
the
test
that
the
government
would
urge
this
court
to
use
in
this
case.
the
test
that
the
government
urges
this
court
to
use
is
simply
to
say
that
since
these
people
are
aliens,
the
government
has
a
right
to
exclude
them
from
any
benefits
conferred
on
citizens.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
no
it
would
not
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
class
--
that
this
case
covers.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
but
he
is
a
nonimmigrant
alien
and
this
case
covers
only
immigrant
aliens,
conditional
entrance.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
i'm
sorry
that's
what
the
lower
court
did
when
they
created
a
class
that's
affected
by
this
case.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
alfred
feinberg
no,
my
position
is
that
you
cannot
use
alienage
as
a
basis
for
discriminating
against
aliens
who
come
to
this
country
and
welcome
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
alfred
feinberg
these
people
are
not
in
a
position
because
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states
to
seek
that
change
until
they
have
been
here
in
theory
for
two
years,
in
practice
for
four
years
and
they
have
not
been
here
for
that
length
of
time.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
no,
on
the
contrary
there's
a
whole
section
in
my
brief
which
addresses
itself
to
that
question.
it
is
much
closer
to
an
immigrant.
for
several
reasons.
i'll
direct
the
court's
attention
to
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
right.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
my
argument
is
directed
at
those
--
about
250,000
who
came
in
between
1965
and
the
present.
those
are
the
people
who
are
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
some
could
have
--
the
particular
plaintiffs
in
this
case
could
not
until
next
year.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
just
--
no,
they've
been
here
since
1971,
but
it
takes
four
years
before
they
can
qualify
to
become
immigrants
which
is
permanent
resident.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
because
--
but
for
the
fact
that
all
of
these
cubans
were
invited
into
this
country
and
are
here
now
the
provisions
of
medicare
part
b
would
not
affect
that
many
people.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
it
fits
to
congress
and
that's
the
point
because
congress
in
a
related
provision
and
yes
i
saw
a
statute.
so
forget
the
question
of
the
alien
who
comes
in
as
a
parolee
and
here
we're
talking
about
indigents
whereas
in
the
case
before
the
court
we're
not
necessarily
talking
about
indigents.
and
what
congress
did
was
they
said
the
following,
this
is
an
act
of
congress
that
i'm
reading
from.
congress
has
authorized
welfare
payments
to
the
indigent
blind,
aged
and
disabled
individual
who
is
“either
(1)
a
citizen
or
(2)
an
alien
lawfully
admitted
for
permanent
residence
or
otherwise
permanently
residing
in
the
united
states
under
color
of
law,”
continuing
the
statute,
“including
any
alien
who
is
lawfully
present
in
the
united
states
as
a
result
of
the
provisions
of
section
1153
(a)
7
which
is
conditional
entrance,”
which
is
in
the
class
that's
included
by
the
lower
court
in
this
case
or
“section
1182
(d)
5
which
is
parolee.”
so
in
other
words
what
congress
has
done
here
is
included
in
the
ssi
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
coverage
for
the
persons
who
are
excluded
from
the
medicare
b
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
and
no
doubt
it
was
an
inadvertent
failure
on
the
part
of
congress
to
do
that
but
we
are
submitting
that
it
is
possible
for
this
court
to
construe
the
admittance
for
permanent
residency
requirements
as
covering
cuban
parolees
because
of
the
fact
that
they
are
covered
here,
because
of
the
fact
that
since
1971
they
must
not
only
have
registered
for
the
military
service
but
are
subject
to
induction
in
the
military
service
as
our
citizens
and
because
of
the
fact
that
they
are
entitled
to
retroactive
adjustment
of
status
which
non-immigrants
are
not
entitled
to
generally
with
some
exceptions
or
after
two
years
presence
in
the
united
states,
they
can
make
an
application
fro
retroactive
adjustment
of
status
to
become
immigrants.
actually
it
takes
four
years
to
get
that
retroactive
adjustment
and
that's
why
i
said
my
clients
could
not
receive
it.
they
came
in
1971
and
we
haven't
--
the
four
years
hasn't
elapsed
yet.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
my
clients
are
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
that
is
correct,
not
only
that.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
well,
the
problem
is
that
we
have
two
definitions
now.
on
the
contemplation
of
law
prior
to
the
act
--
the
provision
that
i
just
read,
he
would
be
considered
a
nonresident
of
the
united
states,
a
legal
fiction
as
you
will.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
right,
but
here
we
have
an
act
of
congress
which
talks
about
them
and
talks
about
in
these
terms.
an
alien
mostly
admitted
for
permanent
residents,
that's
not
--
that's
not
our
point.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
or
otherwise
permanently
residing
in
the
united
states
under
color
of
law
and
then
it
goes
on
to
specifically
say
that
it
includes
parolee.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
so
i
am
saying
that
the
congressional
definition
now
has
changed
what
has
been
the
traditional
definition
and
we
now
have
people
who
are
parolees,
who
in
contemplation
of
law
enacted
by
congress,
an
another
statute
admittedly
but
a
parallel
statute,
within
the
social
security
act
by
the
way,
supplemental
security
income,
are
permanently
residing
in
the
united
states
under
color
of
law,
that's
that
language,
that's
the
statutory
language
that's
used
and
that's
on
page
42
of
the
brief.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
alfred
feinberg
that
is
the
traditional
definition
of
parolee.
i
--
what
i'm
saying
is
that
congress
has
changed
that.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
not
only
do
i
know
the
reason
for
that,
i
don't
even
recall
that
happening
sir.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
judge
fulton
is
the
chief
judge.
my
guess
would
be
that
he
just
simply
assigned
that
the
judge
came,
now
it
just
be
--
mr.
alfred
feinberg
i'm
sorry
i
cannot
illuminate
the
court
in
that
subject.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
my
guess
is
yes
but
i
cannot
be
absolutely
sure
that
could
have
been
the
reason.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
i
certainly
will
and
i
will
inform
the
court.
mr.
alfred
feinberg
yes
sir.
