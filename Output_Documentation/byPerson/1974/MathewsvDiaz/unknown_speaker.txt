mrs.
harriet,
if
you
could
leave
out
the
will
be
part
of
the
class
and
just
limit
it
to
the
have
been,
would
there
be
anyone
in
the
class
other
than
the
named
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not;
we
have
to
assume
as
to
them
that
there
had
been
applications,
which
were
denied?
unknown
speaker
what
i
really
want
to
know
is,
is
your
only
objection
of
the
class
to
the
will
be
portion
of
it
or
do
you
object
anything
more
than
that?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
would
argue
with
in
any
event
the
junction
was
not
proper?
i
gather
at
least
two
of
this
three
were
proper
before
the
district.
unknown
speaker
but
even
assuming
that
they
were
entitled
to
relief,
i
gather
your
submission
is
that
the
only
relief
individually
to
have
the
secretaryâ€™s
termination
reverse,
is
that
right?
and
that
under
no
circumstances
where
those
two
individuals
entitled
to
injunction.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
as
to
those
two
in
saying
that
the
three-judge
court
was
right
and
in
this
circumstance
what
will
we
do,
we
affirm
the
injunction
or
not?
unknown
speaker
this
only
concludes
that
the
district
court
correctly
found
the
statute
unconstitutional.
in
the
cases
of
those
two
individuals
diaz
and
clara,
then
what
do
we
do?
unknown
speaker
but
the
injunction
and
i
gather
is
against
the
secretary
enforcing
that
provision
as
to
anybody.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
you
are
content
with
that
if
be
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
but
is
that
money
been
paid
out
on
application,
for
benefits?
unknown
speaker
what
procedure
by
which
the
government
in
order
has
to
match,
the
aliens,
the
particular
aliens
except.
unknown
speaker
i
know
but
how
does
the
alien
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
secretary
that
there
is
a
duty
to
match
that
670.
unknown
speaker
i
see,
just
enrollment?
unknown
speaker
well
that
is
jurisdictional.
unknown
speaker
if
it
is,
unless
stipulation
the
stipulation
can
really
be
read
as
having
been
a
denial
by
the
secretary,
how
can
the
district
court
have
jurisdiction
of
the
espinosa?
unknown
speaker
the
effect
to
that
mrs.
shapiro
be
then
like
the
efforts
to
confer
jurisdiction
by
a
stipulation?
unknown
speaker
which
is
the
factual
premise
--
unknown
speaker
does
it
really
matter,
merits
are
here
anyway
and
the
other
two
cases
are
not
there,
in
the
clara
and
diaz
cases.
unknown
speaker
whether
we
reach
it
or
not
in
espinosa.
