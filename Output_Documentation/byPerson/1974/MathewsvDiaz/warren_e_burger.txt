chief

e.

very
well.
mr.
feinberg.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
don't
think
the
argument
went
quite
that
far?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
the
there's
some
plenary
power
in
congress
to
deal
with
garbage
man
and
plumbers
to
take
your
illustrations
that's
comparable
to
that
of
immigration?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
with
the
somewhat
provisional
concession
that
mr.
steinman
made
in
the
previous
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
united
states
could
simply
exclude
all
aliens
and
say
no
one
can
come
in
this
country?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
said
provisional
claims.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
he
withdrew
it,
he
gave
it
with
his
right
hand
and
took
it
back
with
his
left,
he
said
when
that
case
came
up,
it
would
take
the
other
position.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
does
it
make
any
difference,
how
many
are
affected?
from
your
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
feinberg.
do
you
have
any
further
mrs.
shapiro?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
feinberg
called
this
a
fundamental
right,
that
is
the
right
to
have
medical
care.
from
what
you
say
i
take
it,
your
response
to
that
would
be
that
it's
a
right
only
as
defined
by
the
congress.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
five-year
residency
is
one
of
the
conditions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
they're
getting
substantial
subsidy
from
the
treasury
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
50%
contribution.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.

can
you
send
a
copy
to
mrs.

and
the
solicitor

office.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
1
o’clock,
we
will
hear
arguments
in
matthews
against
the
united
states.
mrs.
shapiro,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
not
get
many
integers
voluntarily
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rogow.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
would
you
have
to
say
about
class
of
people
who
are
clearly
illegally
in
the
united
states,
smuggled
in
one
way
or
another
which
various
reports
have
indicated
a
very
large
number
of
people,
whatever
the
figure
maybe.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
they
are
discriminated
against,
are
they
not?
their
pains
and
their
needs
are
the
same,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
your
people
should
talk
about
here
now,
are
here
by
the
status
but
qualified
by
the
very
process
that
admitted
them,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
speaking
of
the
other
two.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
put
a
considerable
emphasis
on
the
needs
of
people
which
you
cannot
distinguish
between
the
needs
of
the
illegal
alien
and
one
who
is
here
under
conditional
grant,
can
you?
or
one
who
is
here
with
no
conditions
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
the
ties
of
this
category
of
people
who
maybe
ejected
from
the
country
when
political
conditions
in
their
point
of
origin
permitted?
the
ties
of
such
people,
they
are
temporary
but
the
time
frame
is
merely
longer,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
are
they
different
from
a
journalist
who
is
over
here
to
spend
six
months
studying
our
welfare
system?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
could
say
that
but
they
have
homes
elsewhere
too
even
though
those
homes
may
have
been
confiscated.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
and
then
restate,
they
have
ties
to
the
country,
their
tie
to
the
country
is
condition,
is
it
not?
by
the
fact
that
they
are
admitted
as
temporary
political
refugees
subject
to
exclusion
and
return
to
cuba
when
it
is
politically
feasible
for
them
to
do
so
without
danger,
is
that
not
a
fair
statement
of
their
status
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
non
technically
then
with
–
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
their
own
expressed
actions,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
an
expression
action
that
cuts
the
other
way
if
–
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
did
you
know
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
we
cannot
know
it
either.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
stores
who
close
on
sunday,
had
they
no
injury?
are
they
entitled
to
no
consideration?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
think
there
are
any
substantial
number
of
people
who
really
cannot
do
there
shopping
except
on
sunday.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
apparent,
it
is
enough
to
justify
most
of
the
supermarkets
staying
open
on
sundays
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
on
the
first
amendment
of
the
first
hour
of
the
first
day
on
your
theory,
you
have
to
say
they
are
entitled
of
protection
–
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
rogow.
do
you
have
any
further
mrs.
shapiro?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.

justice
warren
e.
burger

and
opinions
