so
that
is
an
‘r’
rated
movie
up
to
the
time
to
decide
whether
the
child
goes
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
child
and
the
parent
had
no
jurisdiction
of
whether
the
child
stands
on
the
corner,
will
see
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
restricted
to
be
outside?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
merely
says
that
you
shouldn't
show
this
picture
to
children
without
their
parent's
consent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
it
doesn't
but
that’s
what
happened.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don't
say
children
are
interested
in
watching
‘r’
rated
movies.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
beside
the
point
because
mine
is
when
the
parents
say,
“don’t
go
to
that
theater.”
and
then
the
child
said,
“where,
well
i
won’t
go
to
the
theater
to
see
it.”
and
he
just
goes
to
the
corner
and
looks
for
free.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
right--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
part
of
what
this
ordinance
is
aimed
at.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
isn't
part
of
what
this
ordinance
is
aimed
at?
justice
thurgood
marshall
let's
get
back
to
my
brother
rehnquist's
point.
i
mean,
the
average
person
driving
on
the
street
if
he
sees
a
bare
buttocks
on
the
wall
over
there,
he’s
going
to
look
at
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
assume
that
the
average
person
can
recognize
this.
