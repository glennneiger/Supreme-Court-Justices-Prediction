wait,
mr.
maness,
what
if
the
ordinance
merely
provided
that
it
would
be
an
offense
to
exhibit
any
movie
of
any
kind
that
was
visible
from
any
public
street
or
public
place.
would
that
be
more
objectionable
or
constitutionally
or
less
so?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
the
same
ordinance
as
what
you
have
except
that
it
just
says
any
movie
of
any
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
why
wouldn't
it
be
a
perfectly
good
ordinance
regulating
traffic
safety,
you
don't
want
people
driving
down
the
street
looking
at
movies?
justice
potter
stewart
and
why
wouldn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
visible
from
any
public
street.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
any
movie,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
wouldn't
there
be
for
a
rational
relationship?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
generally
public
streets
are
traveled,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
more
or
less.
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
ordinance,
we
would
say
is
more
objectionable
under
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
then
it
might
have
it
after
all
it
would
be.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
this
ordinance
say
this
perhaps
not
important
but
it
goes
--
it
doesn't
apply
only
to
people
in
the
nude.
it
didn't
apply
to
the
same
kind
address
that
people
wherein
on
bathing
beaches
like
clearly
some
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
but
they
do
is
and
thereâ€™s
some
of
the
saw
the
language
but
i
don't
really
think
it's
very
important.
justice
potter
stewart
in
many
bathing
suits
reach
to
the
point
covered
by
some
of
this
language.
