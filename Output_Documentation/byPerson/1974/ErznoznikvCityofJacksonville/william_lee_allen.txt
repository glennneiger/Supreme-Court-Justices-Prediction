mr.
william
lee
allen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
sitting
with
me
at
the
counsel
table
is
harry
shorstein,
the
general
counsel
of
the
city,
i
am
the
assistant
counsel.
and
most
of
the
cases
set
forth
in
the
appellant's
brief
and
the
argument
made
here
today
would
suggest
that
what
we’re
dealing
with
is
obscenity.
but
our
position
is
at
this
particular
ordinance
deals
solely
with
a
public
nuisance
which
has
been
long
recognized
to
be
the
power
and
the
duty
of
municipalities
at
common
law
to
obey.
now,
there's
been
some
discussion
at
the
ordinance,
it
doesn't
deal
specifically
with
children
and
doesn’t
deal
specifically
with
traffic.
normally,
ordinances
are
not
written
in
a;
whereas,
whereas,
whereas
form
like
a
resolution.
i
think
court's
know
and
this
court
knows
what
everyone
else
knows
and
that
is
as
one
drives
along
the
highway,
one
can
see
driving
screen,
screens,
raises
up
in
the
air.
and
if
we
see
something
and
catches
our
eye,
we
tend
to
look
at
it
and
it
could
distract
us
and
cause
us
problems.
i
think
we
know
as
the
file
judge
did
in
this
case
that
children
make
up
a
percentage,
a
growing
percentage
that
a
population
in
this
country.
certainly,
the
ordinance
does
not
purport
to
regulate
obscenity,
only
nudity
and
i
certainly
would
suggest
traffic.
the
willful
and
intentional
exposure
of
one's
private
parts
is
been
a
crime
at
the
common
law.
one
of
the
cases
sided
in
our
brief
dealt
with
some
swimmers
in
the
national
forest
who
had
been
swimming
in
the
nude.
then
they
decided
they
want
to
get
him
some
watermelons
into
relying
upon
the
riverbank
in
the
nude
eating
watermelons.
their
conviction
was
upheld
by
the
tenth
circuit
and
i
think
properly
so.
certainly,
if
you
cannot
prohibit
this
at
the
driving,
you
cannot
prohibit
it
at
the
hollywood
bowl
or
any
place
out
in
the
public.
you
could
not
prohibit
people
walking
around
in
the
nude
on
public
streets.
mr.
william
lee
allen
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
i
suggest
that
people
don't
walk
around
on
bathing
beaches
most
places
with
bare
female
breast
or
with
bear
buttock
showing
or
with
the
pubic
areas
showing
in
but
--
mr.
william
lee
allen
yes.
some
of
the
bathing
suits
that
are
seen,
we
may
reach
that
point
almost
but
not
quite.
mr.
william
lee
allen
yes.
now,
from
the
bloss
case
which
is
--
mr.
william
lee
allen
well,
your
honor,
mr.
maness
--
i
don't
--
there
maybe
some
that
mr.
maness
--
mr.
william
lee
allen
well,
this
probably
would
serve
mr.
maness
says
put
some
pictures
in
the
brief
that
is
submitted
to
the
court
showing
on
the
wall
of
the
do
all
kind
of
courthouse.
justice
and
a
male
along
with
her
and
of
course,
they
have
grapes
across
the
pubic
areas
and
they
are
no
bare
buttocks
and
her
bare
breast
are
showing
and
some
of
these
would
run
a
foul
but
normally
small
children
i
would
submit
your
honor
are
not
the
present
day
in
this
--
mr.
william
lee
allen
sir?
mr.
william
lee
allen
your
honor,
i
see
a
few.
i
would
never
further
agree
to
bunch
out
on
these
smaller
children
your
honor.
but
if
--
mr.
william
lee
allen
i
think
those
are
intent
mr.
justice
blackmun,
is
the
evidence
shows
and
the
record
shows.
there
are
several
private
streets
with
private
residences
and
there
was
one
lady
testifying
in
the
case
that
she
could
sit
down
on
her
front
porch
and
actually
watch
the
movie.
there
are
pictures
in
there
but
answered
before
this
court
showing
the
screen.
mr.
william
lee
allen
while
the
streets
have
been
held
to
be
a
public
places
your
honor.
mr.
william
lee
allen
i
would
submit
sir,
that
the
backyard
would
not
be
a
public
place.
mr.
william
lee
allen
no,
sir.
and
in
the
bloss
case
cited
in
my
brief
gave
some
idea
of
the
size
screen
there.
i
think
they
help
us
realize
what
were
talking
about,
35
feet
by
70
feet
and
54
feet
above
the
ground.
so,
if
we
have
a
nude
breast
or
bare
buttocks
or
pubic
areas,
they're
magnified
considerably.
i
think
the
example
use
in
our
brief
was
that
of
a
strict
which
our
fad
is
fizzled
out
to
some
extent.
but
you'd
have
a
king-size
streakier,
streaking
across
the
end
and
if
there's
--
if
you
can't
prohibit
this,
as
we
again
indicate
you
could
put
home
movies
out
in
your
backyards.
suppose
you
and
your
family
belong
the
nudist
camp.
you
took
some
films
at
the
nudist
camp.
you
wanted
to
show
those
and
they
would
be
visible
from
the
street.
you
got
to
set
up
out
in
the
front
yard.
i
submit
this
would
be
clearly
violent.
we
sight
the
hoffman
case
where
a
go-go
dancer
was
nude.
dancing
and
displaying
her
private
parts.
now,
this
court
dismissed
the
appeal.
there
again,
this
was
a
matter
of
nudity
which
i
submit
that
municipalities
certain
have
not
only
the
right
that
the
obligation
to
maintain.
certainly,
speaking
of
growing
an
ordinance
narrowly
to
protect
juveniles,
it
isn't
like
prior
censorship
or
books
that
can
be
bought
at
bookstores
or
films
that
can
be
bought,
there’s
no
way.
mr.
maness
spoke
of
this
and
he's
a
former
state
circuit
judge.
there's
no
way
you
could
draw
an
ordinance
spelling
all
this
out.
it
would
to
submit
it
would
be
so
long
and
involve
and
contradictory
in
terms
that
it
would
just
be
no
way
that
it
could
be
done.
now,
i
might
touch
on
what
this
court
has
said
from
time
to
time
about
these
matters
in
the
burstyn
case
in
which
the
court
first
held
freedom
of
speech
to
apply
to
movie
theaters.
the
court
said
at
page
502,
“it
does
not
follow
that
the
constitutional
requires
absolute
freedom
to
exhibit
every
motion
picture
of
every
kind
at
all
times
and
all
places,
that’s
what
we
have
here.”
then
the
redrup
case
spoke
about
protecting
juveniles.
in
stanley
versus
georgia,
this
court
spoke
of
the
danger
of
juveniles
finding
things.
now,
the
appellant
in
his
brief
says,
“well,
that
most
parents
if
they
are
honest
will
admit
that
they
don’t
know
what
is
proper.
well,
that’s
something
that
a
parent
cannot
advocate
his
responsibility.
where
you're
conflicting
testimonies
from
various
child
experts,
to
dr.
spock
and
others
and
possible
to
some
of
the
permissiveness
that
does
emerge
the
greatest
part
of
the
problem.
but
it's
a
parent's
right,
i
think,
we're
speaking
of
constitutional
rights.
it's
his
duty
to
see
what
his
children
see
and
don't
see.
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
the
rabeck
case
decided
most
recently
by
this
court,
which
i
think
this
is
what
we're
talking
about
and
its
only
opinion
of
this
court
that
i
could
find
dealing
with
driving-in
theaters.
the
question
there
was
these
sexually
frank
scenes
but
the
statute
did
not
make
it
clear
that
there
would
be
punishment
for
showing
it
at
the
drive-in,
whereas
you
would
be
permitted
at
the
close-type
theater.
but
as
said
by
the
chief
justice
joined
by
mr.
rehnquist
in
the
separate
concurring
opinions,
public
displays
of
explicit
material
such
as
are
described
in
this
record
are
not
significantly
different
from
any
noxious
public
nuisance,
traditionally
within
the
power
of
the
states
to
regulate
and
prohibit,
and
in
my
view
involved
no
significant
countervailing
first
amendment
considerations,
an
offensive
nuisance.
certainly,
it's
something
that
has
to
be
considerably
weighing
of
the
interest
of
the
public
is
against
the
right
of
the
man
showing
the
movie.
they're
not
prohibited
from
showing
nude
movies.
they're
not
prohibited
from
having
consenting
adults
or
others
coming
in.
they
only
provision
of
the
ordinance
is
if
you're
going
to
show
a
movie
which
is
visible
from
a
public
street
or
a
public
place.
then,
you
have
to
not
show
a
movie
which
has
bare
breast,
bare
buttocks
or
the
bare
pubic
hairs.
thank
you.
mr.
william
lee
allen
well,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
this
would
be
the
harris
story
that
mr.
maness
is
raising
his
brief,
the
little
girl
that
we've
all
seen
in
the
coppertone
sunshine
advertisements
where
the
dog's
pulling
their
swimming
trunks
down.
mr.
william
lee
allen
yes.
mr.
william
lee
allen
well,
i
would
suggest
that
i
--
this
cannot
conceived
of
anyone
being
prosecuted
if
they
showed
a
babies
bare
buttocks
that
someone
was
powdering.
