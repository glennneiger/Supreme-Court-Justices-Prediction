we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1942,
erznoznik
against
jacksonville.
mr.
maness,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
we
care
about
the
motives?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
his
motive
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
city
could
have
an
ordinance
prohibiting
soundtracks
from
operating
during
hours,
let
us
say
after
10
oâ€™clock
at
night?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
at
anytime
that
the
sound
level
was
over
a
certain
decibel
level?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
if
--
what
if
the
candidates
running
for
public
office
and
he
wants
to
make
a
speech?
that's
one
of
the
highest
forms
of
the
first
amendment
right,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
concede
that
if
it
annoys,
if
it's
loud
enough
so
that
rationally
it
can
be
said
that
this
annoys
a
lot
of
people
and
maybe
affects
their
hearing
but
then
it
can
be
prohibited.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
suggesting
that
in
order
to
sustain
one
statute
it
must
be
demonstrated
that
it's
reaches
perfect
candidate
to
either
that
or
in
combination
with
other
statutes.
all
such
conduct
is
completely
prescribed
and
prohibited
while
there's
no
such
doctrine
of
laws
out,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
statutes
against
murder
is
to
survive
eventhough
in
murders
are
continued
at
a
very
great
rate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
maness.
mr.
allen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
any
further
mr.
maness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
maness.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
73-1942,
erznoznik
against
jacksonville
--
the
city
of
jacksonville,
and
74-634,
united
states
against
nobles
will
each
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
powell.
