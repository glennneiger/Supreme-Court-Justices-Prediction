justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
that,
what
about
the
nude
performances
in
the
public
park.
let's
say
there's
a
summer
play
series
in
the
public
park
where
and
it's
a
municipal
--
it's
in
the
park
and
--
but
there's
a
law
that
says
as
long
as
you’re
showing
it
in
an
open-air
and
people
can
come
and
go
unless
it's
public,
no
nudity.
no
nudes
in
this
summer
plays
in
the
park,
is
that
too
bad?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
would
say
that’s
acceptable?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
saying,
if
you're
going
to
walk
down
the
street,
wear
some
clothes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
city
fathers
that
what
you
view
the
screen
is
that
it's
all
located
that
anybody
wants
to
have
nice
speech
of
stop
and
watch
the
entire
movie.
and
the
fact
is
that
at
this
corner
the
children
gather
--
justice
byron
r.
white
to
watch
the
movies
and
if
they're
going
--
if
you
want
your
screen
in
that
location,
just
don't
show
x-rated
movies.
if
the
kids
are
going
to
--
you're
going
to
let
the
kids
gather
outside
and
watch
this
--
this
--
if
you
want
to
just
keep
--
just
clean
up
your
movies
a
little
bit.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
what
i'm
talking
about.
i'm
talking
about
children.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
happen
to
the
case
as
that
--
who
is
watching
these
movies?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know.
that
and
nobody
objects
to
that
saying,
city
council
--
justice
byron
r.
white
agrees
to
that
showing
is
--
the
parents
in
town
object
to
the
screen
showing
x-rated
movies
to
their
children?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
your
position
covers
all
--
covers
x-rated
movies
or
any
other
related
movie,
so
let's
don’t
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
maness,
what
is
the
consequence
of
under
this
ordinance
if
the
establishment
is
declared
a
nuisance?
is
it
just
that
he
is
convicted
of
maintaining
a
public
nuisance?
is
it
a
misdemeanor?
justice
byron
r.
white
showing
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
that
the
word
nuisance
in
there
is
sort
of
passage
in
the
sense
the
ordinance
could've
said,
whoever
shows
on
a
screen
visible
to
the
public
street
commits
a
misdemeanor?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
--
i
mean,
it
doesn't
have
the
consequence,
ordinary
consequence
with
news
of
being
able
to
shut
it
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
permit
the
city
to
shut
down
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
usually
you're
beating
nuisances.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
indeed
it
does
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
only
thing
that's
a
nuisance
is
that
that
single
showing
or
whatever
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
thank
you.
