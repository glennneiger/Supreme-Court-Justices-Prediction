justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
--
for
the
legislature
to
make
or
initially
as
to
which
social
benefit
weighs
most
heavily
if
itâ€™s
acting
rationally?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
how
can
you
be
that
positive
if
it's
not
traffic
safety?
isn't
it
permissible
for
the
jacksonville
city
council
to
say
that
bare
breast
and
bare
buttock
maybe
more
distracting
to
drivers
along
the
highway
than
the
picture
of
snow
white?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
why
they
--
why
does
the
legislature
have
to
say
all
the
reasons
behind
it?
i
mean,
if
an
argument
can
now
be
advanced
that
supports
the
rationality,
but
what
more
does
this
court
need?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
think
of
the
motives?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
say
that
the
city
of
jacksonville
could
go
beyond
what
has
been
called
obscene
by
this
court
and
make
a
broader
proscription.
and
just
obscenity
when
you're
talking
about
projecting
it
beyond
the
theater
walls
to
the
public?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
something
less
obscene
than
what
this
court
has
said
can
be
prohibited
by
the
state
within
the
walls
of
the
theater
where
everybody
is
consented
to
see
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
protected
speech
as
you're
using
it?
is
it
anything
that's
not
obscene?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you're
saying
that
jacksonville
can't
prohibit
in
an
outdoor
movie
that's
projected
beyond
the
walls
that
of
the
theater.
anything
that
it
couldn't
prohibit
in
an
indoor
movie?
