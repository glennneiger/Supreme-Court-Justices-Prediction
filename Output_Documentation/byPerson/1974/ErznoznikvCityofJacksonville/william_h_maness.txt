mr.
william
h.
maness
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
florida
in
which
a
decision
could
be
hand
which
decision
upheld
the
unconstitutionally
of
the
jacksonville
city
ordinance.
which
makes
it
unlawful
ad
provides,
it
is
hereby
declared
a
public
nuisance
to
exhibit
for
certain
persons
to
exhibit.
any
motion
picture
in
which
the
human
male
or
female
bare
buttocks,
human
female
bare
breast
or
human
bare
pubic
areas
are
shown
if
such
motion
picture
is
visible
from
any
public
street
or
public
place.
my
client,
richard
erznoznik
is
the
manager
of
the
university
drive-in
theater.
in
1972
shortly
after
the
passage
of
this
ordinance,
he
was
charge
with
knowingly
exhibiting
a
motion
picture
in
which
the
human
female
buttocks
and
bare
breast
was
shown
said
scenes
being
visible
from
a
public
street
or
a
public
place,
and
it
was
summons
to
appear
in
court
april
6,
1972.
he
appeared
and
by
stipulation,
the
prosecution
was
stayed
in
order
that
we
might
test
the
constitutionality
of
this
ordinance
by
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
in
the
circuit
court
of
two-old-county
which
is
the
highest
trial
court.
we
filed
that
complaint,
we
had
our
trial.
the
trial
court
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
the
district
court
of
appeals
affirmed
relying
upon
the
chemline
case
from
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
denied
certiorari
by
4-3
vote.
now,
little
more
that
it
be
said
than
has
been
said
in
my
brief
and
the
brief
of
amicus
motion
picture
association
of
america.
what
i
would
like
to
emphasize
is
the
total
failure
of
those
who
drafted
this
ordinance
and
the
florida
courts
that
have
construed
it
to
sharpen
its
focus
and
confine
its
proscriptions,
so
as
not
to
censor
or
punish
protected
speech.
we
do
not
question
the
basic
constitutional
panel
of
the
states
and
the
cities
to
enact
laws
which
punish
or
inhibit
unprotected
speech
or
which
protect
unwilling
persons
against
obtrusive
public
displays
of
explicit
sexual
material
which
are
both
grossly
offensive
and
unavoidable.
but
we
do
contend
that
such
laws
must
be
carefully
drawn
or
authoritatively
construed,
so
that
they
are
not
susceptible
to
application
to
speech
protected
by
the
first
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
william
h.
maness
yes.
mr.
william
h.
maness
i
would
not.
mr.
william
h.
maness
this
was
an
‘r’
rated
film,
the
class
of
74.
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
the
reason,
we
don't
think
it’s
a
time
and
place
issue.
we
did
plead
that
and
announce
it
for
declaratory
decree
is
because
basically,
it
gets
down
to
whether
or
not
the
city
council
has
the
power
to
declare
whatever
it
pleases
a
public
nuisance.
and
in
this
instance,
they've
chosen
to
declare
the
mere
showing
of
these
anatomical
parts
a
nuisance.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
as
showing
on
an
outdoor
movie
screen
visible
from
a
public
place.
mr.
william
h.
maness
i
would
say
it's
be
equally
objectionable
because
that
seeks
to
in
--
assuming
that
it's
declared
a
public
nuisance
also.
mr.
william
h.
maness
i
would
say
it's
an
unlawful
infringement
on
protected
speech,
visual
portrayals
because
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
if
it
were
related
to
traffic
safety
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
then,
well
it
wouldn’t
be
unless
it
was
so
construed.
if
by
its
very
language
it
just
says,
“it
shall
be
unlawful
to
exhibit
on
an
outdoor
screen
visible
from
a
public
place
of
movie.”
mr.
william
h.
maness
a
movie.
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
i
think
you’d
have
to
show
that
there’s
some
relationship
between
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
i
don't
think
so.
unless
you
said,
where
the
exhibition
is
visible
from
a
traveled
highway
and
there
is
a
showing
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
well?
mr.
william
h.
maness
i
would
not
--
i
would
say
there's
no
relationship.
the
social
benefit
to
be
derived
from
prohibiting
any
movie
visible
from
any
public
place,
it
seemed
to
me
is
not
outweighed
in
the
traffic
sense.
it
does
not
out
weigh
the
first
amendment
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
if
it
is
--
yes,
if
it's
acting
rationally.
yes,
if
there’s
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
no,
it
could
not.
mr.
william
h.
maness
correct.
i
was
answering
the
speculated
question
but
the
purpose
of
this
ordinance
is
definitely
not
traffic
safety.
mr.
william
h.
maness
much
more.
as
i
would
--
if
i
get
that
far,
as
i
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
yes,
if
they'd
said
that
or
if
the
courts
had
construed
that
into
it,
maybe.
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
the
same
rationale
that
we've
been
talking
about
in
defining
word
cases.
that
is
that
while
you
may
construe
that
way
and
uphold
its
validity,
it
may
not
be
applied
that
way
by
the
police
officer
or
the
prosecutor
who
makes
the
charge.
he
may
bring
the
prosecution
simply
because
he's
opposed
to
nudity
in
any
form,
in
any
time,
in
any
place.
mr.
william
h.
maness
well
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
if
we
are,
as
i
understand
the
protect
--
protection
we
afford
speech
in
this
country.
we
are
concerned
about
the
motives
of
the
persons
who
seek
to
inhibit
it
by
some
means
other
than
no
ordinance
or
a
law
that’s
narrowly
drawn
or
authoritatively
construed
to
get
at
only
unprotected
speech
or
unprotected
conduct.
now,
if
you
can
put
a
law
of
books
that
can
be
construed
in
a
half
of
dozen
ways,
then
we
violate
that
principle.
if
that
principle
is
to
be
violated,
then
this
court
can
say
so.
but,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
compare
this
to
the
defining
words
cases,
you
have
to
say,
if
the
city
of
jacksonville
wants
to
do
that.
they've
got
to
draw
this
ordinance
more
carefully
or
it's
got
to
be
authoritatively
construed
not
to
infringe
on
otherwise
protected
speech.
mr.
william
h.
maness
yes,
i
think
they'd
probably
could
something
more
obscene
then
mere
nudity.
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
that's
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer
because
i
have
tried
to
figure
out
how
this
ordinance
could
have
been
authoritatively
construed
in
the
florida
courts
to
achieve
a
purpose
that
does
not
trench
upon
protected
speech
and
i
don’t
see
how
it
can.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
draw
such
an
ordinance.
mr.
william
h.
maness
no.
it's
anything
that
this
court
has
held
unprotected
such
as
lewd
and
obscene,
profane,
libelous,
insulting,
confiding
words,
words
which
are
very
arrogant,
not
words
portray
or
portrayals
or
pictures
that
tend
to
insight
immediate
breach
of
the
peace
or
something
of
that
sort.
mr.
william
h.
maness
no,
i'm
not
really
saying
that.
i
don't
intend
to
say
that.
i
intend
--
what
i
intend
to
say
is
that
if
they
relate
it
to
something
that
isn't
in
fact
a
nuisance.
they
can
prohibit
images
on
a
screen
that
would
create
dangers
to
the
citizens.
but
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
they
could
prohibit
it
just
like
they
could
prohibit
outdoor
and
in
other
words,
they
could
prohibit
outdoor
theaters.
mr.
william
h.
maness
i
suppose
they
could.
but
until
they
decide
to
prohibit
outdoor
theaters
that
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
i
think
so,
there's
we
have
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
as
i
read.
i
think
it's
a
question
of
--
i
think
the
city
fathers
could
decide
that
question
like
they've
decided
they
don't
own
some
of
the
beaches
down
in
florida
but
they
even
had
a
vote
as
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
acceptable
with
the
proper
words
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
yes,
at
this
point
in
history.
i
think
it
probably
is.
mr.
william
h.
maness
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
william
h.
maness
i
think
so.
mr.
william
h.
maness
it
is
but
you
know,
it's
the
question
who's
making
the
judgment
in
a
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
under
the
impression
that
under
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
that
such
an
ordinance
could
be
narrowly
drawn
authoritatively
construed
and
upheld.
eventhough,
it
does
in
trench
strongly
on
first
amendment
rights.
but
i
don't
really
see
the
parallel
between
that
and
mere
nudity
on
an
outdoor
movie
screen
if
you’re
going
to
have
any
films
of
any
kind.
mr.
william
h.
maness
if
there
was
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
if
they
passed
an
ordinance
such
as
you're
speaking
of
and
related
it
specifically
to
traffic
problems
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
alright,
if
they
related
the
ordinance
to
children?
i
think
they
might
very
well
come
up
with
an
ordinance
that
could
stand
constitutional
master.
but
this
ordinance
is
no
related
to
any
of
those
things.
mr.
william
h.
maness
that,
yes,
but
the
children
would
be
outside
watching
the
movies
if
it
was
mary
poppins
mr.
william
h.
maness
no.
right.
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
we're
not
talking
about
x-rated
movie.
we're
talking
about
one
hour
movie,
the
class
of
’74.
this
is
not
a
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
yes.
yes,
under
17.
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
you
know
we
have
other
laws
that
such
as
laws
against
trespass
and
littering,
and
other
ways
of
permitting
those
who
are
inside
the
theater
to
see
what
they
want
to
see
without
interference
from
those
outside
the
theater.
mr.
william
h.
maness
this
ordinance
is
restricted,
so
restricted
yes.
mr.
william
h.
maness
mr.
justice
marshall,
it
doesn't
mentioned
children.
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
i
doubt
it
that’s
what
happened.
mr.
william
h.
maness
i
think
the
children
go
in
and
they
want
to
see
it.
you
know,
they
get
their
parents
permission,
they
get
in
car
and
they
go
in.
but
that’s
beside
the
point,
of
course
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
well
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
that
happens.
mr.
william
h.
maness
but
if
he
was
looking
at
this
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
yes.
and
if
he
were
looking
at
a
travel
law
of
foreign
lands,
or
art
museums,
or
a
health
picture,
or
even
a
news
room,
he
might
also
see
a
bare
female
breast,
or
bare
male
or
female
buttocks
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
movie.
so,
the
point
is,
can
the
movie
be
suppress
simply
and
solely
because
it
has
scenes
of
this
anatomical
parts
in
it
regardless
of
the
context.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
falls
right
in
with
the
whole
line
of
cases
of
this
court
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
if
he
recognizes
it
as
such.
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
i've
driven
by
these
movie
screens.
and
i
am
only
speaking
from
my
own
experience
and
i
have
seen
figures
on
the
screen
and
not
really
known
what
they
were.
i
didn't
give
that
much
of
an
attention
to
it.
you
see
movement,
you
see
flashes,
and
you
see
color.
mr.
william
h.
maness
no.
not
that
broad.
mr.
william
h.
maness
and
we
define
the
degrees
of
murder,
first,
second,
third,
manslaughter,
justifiable
or
excusable
homicide.
but
we
don't
define
the
degrees
of
offense
that
we
commit
when
one
scene
of
nudity
comes
on
the
screen.
mr.
william
h.
maness
it's
a
low
grade
misdemeanor.
but
it's
not
a
matter
of
establishing
the
theater
as
being
a
nuisance.
it
just
simply
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
it
subjects
the
projectionist
or
the
manager
or
ticket
taker,
someone
of
those
to
a
criminal
penalty.
mr.
william
h.
maness
i
would
say
that
that's
pretty
much
correct
but
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
no.
it
does
not.
mr.
william
h.
maness
it
says,
it's
unlawful
and
hereby
declared
a
public
nuisance
to
do
this.
but
the
public
nuisance
doctrine,
i
think
is
the
justification
for
inhibiting
it.
mr.
william
h.
maness
right.
mr.
william
h.
maness
it's
the
right.
they
usually
do
but
in
this
--
mr.
william
h.
maness
well,
i
don't
think
that's
not
even
a
nuisance.
that's
just
the
basis
on
which
they
justify
make
another
penalty.
mr.
william
h.
maness
this
--
well,
i
started
to
say,
we
do
not
--
but
we
do
contend
that
such
laws
must
be
carefully
drawn
or
authoritatively
construed
and
i
want
to
point
out
some
of
the
reach
to
this
ordinance.
it
manifests
no
particular
concern
for
persons
in
the
privacy
of
their
homes
and
yards,
only
persons
in
public
streets
of
places.
it
does
not
deal
with
captive
audiences,
audiences
who
cannot
escape
looking
or
being
bombarded
or
who
cannot
escape
being
force
to
confront
a
situation.
it
manifests
no
concern
for
highway
safety
or
traffic
hazards.
it
is
not
concern
with
public
displays
of
scenes
depicting
explicit
sexual
activity
and
is
not
related
to
obscenity
or
pornography.
it
does
not
deal
with
materials
so
grossly
offensive
or
emotionally
disturbing
to
a
non-unwilling
audience
as
to
be
the
proper
subject
of
criminal
proscription.
it
takes
no
account
of
the
duration
or
the
context
of
such
nudity
whether
the
scenes
are
from
a
travel
log,
etcetera
and
the
ordinance
classes
violently,
i
think,
with
the
long
lying
of
cases
in
this
court
which
have
drawn
a
distinction
between
protected
and
unprotected
speech,
the
fighting
word
cases.
what
is
been
said
by
this
court
in
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
in
those
cases
from
cohen
versus
california
to
caroline
versus
city
of
cincinnati.
i
think
it
applies
to
this
case
and
condemned
this
ordinance.
for
example,
the
court
said
in
cohen
versus
california,
“the
ability
of
government
to
shut
off
this
course,
solely
to
protect
others
from
hearing
it
is
dependent
upon
showing
that
substantial
privacy
interest
of
being
invaded
in
an
essentially
intolerable
manner.”
this
ordinance
has
not
been
so
construed.
now,
even
the
decent
in
by
mr.
justice
powell
with
whom
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
joined
in
rosenfeld
versus
new
jersey.
if
you
take
those
principles
and
apply
them
to
this
case,
this
ordinance
cannot
stand
constitutional
master
because
it
does
nothing
and
says
nothing
to
inhibit
the
traditionally
unprotected
speech,
and
on
the
other
hand
where
movies
are
concerned.
it
can
never
be
said
that
the
chief
and
the
child
are
no
essential
part
of
the
exposition
of
ideas
or
that
such
as
positions
have
so
slight
social
value
as
to
be
step
to
truth
that
any
benefit
that
make
--
that
maybe
derive
from
them
is
clearly
outweighed
by
the
social
interest
in
order
and
morality.
though
perhaps
implied,
in
the
city's
brief
and
truth,
their
ordinance
in
question
does
not
even
concern
itself
with
children,
children
littering
or
trespassing,
and
at
least
the
florida
courts
have
not
so
construed
it
in
this
court
must
take
it
on
its
phase.
i'll
save
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
h.
maness
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
just
to
add
this
argument.
i
realized

mr.
chief
justice,
language
in
reed
versus
washington
where
he
said,
“i
for
one
would
be
unwilling
to
hold
that
the
first
amendment
prevents
a
state
from
prohibiting
such
a
public
display
of
scenes
depicting
explicit
sexual
activities,
if
the
state
undertook
to
do
so
under
a
statute
narrowly
drawn
to
protect
the
public
from
such
potential
exposure.
i
don't
think
we
are
quarrelling
with
that
language
ourselves.
what
i'm
saying
is,
the
city
claims
the
power
to
declare
and
abate
nuisances
and
that
is
determination
is
conclusive
and
binding
on
the
court.
and
if
such
be
so,
while
which
we
deny,
it
is
a
short
step
from
declaring
mere
nudity
a
public
nuisance
when
exhibited
on
an
outdoor
movie
screen
visible
from
a
public
place
regardless
of
its
context
of
his
presentation
and
from
there
declaring
movies
with
unpopular
themes
or
ideas
without
nudity
of
public
nuisance.

the

brands
that

a

to
give

censorship

the

the

the

does
not
speak
for
me
when
it
determines
that
a

female
breast
on

a
public

it
smacks
of
the
male

then
i

it
is.
