if
this
still
had
been
shown
in
a
close
theater,
you
wouldn’t
be
here
would
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

so?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
i
was
wondering
while
this
isn’t
in
a
time
and
place
issue
rather
than
the
first
amendment
one.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

public,
public
showing
is
the
issue?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
why
i
suppose
if
the
matters
if
this
ordinance
could
not
be
applied
as
the
motion
picture
for
example,
that
was
exhibited
at
the
time
was
snow
white,
could
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so,
to
that
extent,
there's
a
distinction
going
would
suggest
that
the
purpose
of
this
ordinance
does
not
traffic
safety.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
don't
you
think
mr.
maness,
for
example
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
state
might
say
as
to
an
open-air
movie.
now,
that
even
an
exhibition
of
a
picture
in
which
react
to
simply
recite
the
first
amendment.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
interest
to
safety?
justice

a
jacksonville,
florida
ordinance,
directed
at
move
in
--
at
drive-in
movie
theaters
prohibits
the
exhibition
of
films
which
contain
nudity.
the
ordinance
was
sustained
by
the
florida
courts
and
came
to
us
on
appeal.
as
we
conclude
that
the
ordinance
infringes
first
amendment
rights,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
florida
court.
this
is
an
obscene
--
this
is
not
an
obscenity
ordinance
as
it
proscribes
the
showing
of
any
nudity
however
innocent
or
educational.
it
nevertheless
was
depended
on
three
grounds.
one,
as
preventing
offense
to
persons
on
public
streets,
two,
as
protecting
children
from
scenes
of
nudity,
and
three,
as
a
traffic
measure.
in
our
view,
the
ordinance
is
both
overbroad
and
underinclusive
when
tested
against
its
specified
purposes.
the
intrusion
on
the
privacy
of
passersby
is
limited.
the
legitimate
state
interest
in
protecting
children
from
obscenity
is
not
furthered
and
if
designed
as
a
traffic
measure,
many
things
such
as
scenes
of
horror
and
violence
are
more
likely
to
distract
than
many
of
the
fleeting
shots
of
nudity
that
abide
by
this
ordinance.
in
sum,
although
a
city
or
a
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
that
would
support
a
non-discriminatory
ordinance
regulating
drive-in
theaters
this
ordinance
unduly
infringes
upon
first
amendment
rights
with
little
prospect
of
furthering
any
of
the
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
justice
douglas
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
the
chief
justice
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
joined.
mr.
justice
white
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
