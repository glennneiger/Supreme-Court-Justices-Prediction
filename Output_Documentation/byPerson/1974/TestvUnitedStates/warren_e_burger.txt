mr.
gerash.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
lost
me
there
a
little
bit
mr.
gerash.
what
empirical
data
is
available
to
show
that
it
balances
it
out?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
though
you're
saying
that
there
are
as
many
spanish
people
--
people
of
spanish
origins
or
mexican
origins
who
marry
non-spanish
names
like
jones
or
peterson
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
and
vice
versa.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
don't
see
how
you
could
do
that
except
by
an
absolute
headcount.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mathematics
does
not
have
much
of
play
in
marriage
problems,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
marry
on
a
mathematical
basis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
mathematical
of
this
extent
that
is
as
many
men
marry
women
as
women
marry
men.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
antecedents
--
ethnic
antecedents?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
is
a
sampling
only,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
many
of
them
were
missed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
same
was
true
with
negroes
and
other
ethnics
groups,
was
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
speaking
now
to
the
jury
wheel,
not
to
a
specific
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you're
addressing
your
remarks
to
what
must
be
done
with
the
total
names
going
into
the
jury
wheel,
not
the
colored
people
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
or
who
simply
who'll
go
into
the
box?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
patton.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that's
what
had
to
be
done
after
the
voting
age
was
changed,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there's
a
time
limit
now,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
seven
days,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
example
of
this
time
occurred
when
the
voting
age
was
changed
it
took,
as
i
recall
it,
substantially
more
than
a
year
to
bring
that
voter
wheel
up
to
date.
so
that
there's
bound
to
be
a
lag
when
you're
dealing
with
a
large
omitted
group.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
patton.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
gerash?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understood
mr.
patton
to
say
that
it
was
--
your
affidavit
was
as
good
as
sufficient
as
it
could
be
without
an
examination
of
the
list?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
73-5993,
test
against
the
united
states.
and

reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
this
morning
with
the

case
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
tenth
circuit
with
instructions
to

in
turn
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
of
the
court.
