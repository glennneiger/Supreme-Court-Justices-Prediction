justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
contend
that
you're
entitled
to
a
new
trial
if
we
agree
with
you,
do
we?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
you're
just
entitled
to
an
examination
of
the
jury
lists?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
no
need
for
any
sort
of
prima
facie
showing
before
you
have
a
right
to
inspect,
in
your
view?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
existed
before
the
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
how
many
counties
does
the
denver
district
of
the
--
district
of
colorado
drawn
for
its
jury
selection?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
think
if
you
have
to
make
a
prima
facie
showing
making
it
just
in
boulder
county,
might
not
be
sufficient?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
that
may
be
militates
against
the
prima
facie
showing
argument,
rather
than
saying
that
you
can
make
a
prima
facie
showing
by
1
out
of
20?
