mr.
william
l.
patton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
finds
itself
into
somewhat
unusual
position
of
agreeing
with
the
petitioner
on
the
only
issue
which
we
consider
to
be
ripe
for
review
in
this
case.
that
is,
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
an
unqualified
right
under
the
jury
selection
act
to
inspect
the
jury
lists,
and
that
the
district
court
denial
of
petitioner’s
motion
to
inspect
in
this
case
was
error.
and
we
do
not
believe
that
it
can
be
properly
characterized
as
harmless.
we
think
there’s
an
unqualified
right
to
inspect
the
list
because
the
statute
accord
such
a
right.
section
1867
(f)
explicitly
states
that
the
party
shall
be
allowed
to
inspect
and
copy
all
records
used
in
the
jury
selection
process,
and
the
jury
list
are
of
course
such
records.
in
the
legislative
history
confirms
that
the
statute
means
exactly
what
it
says.
moreover,
we
believe
inspection
of
the
list
is
necessary
to
an
effective
utilization
of
the
act
to
challenge
procedures.
i
would
like
to
correct
something
mr.
gerash
said
in
his
argument.
i
have
seen
better
affidavits
than
mr.
gerash’
affidavit,
but
i
do
say
that
it
is
unlikely
that
counsel
to
be
able
to
come
up
with
a
better
affidavit,
unless
he
can
see
the
jury
list.
now,
there
had
been
occasional
cases
which
have
indicated
that
the
sworn
statement,
which
is
required
by
1867
(a),
is
a
precondition
to
inspection.
but
we
believe
those
decisions
are
plainly
wrong
because
1837
(f)
says
that
you
can
inspect
the
list
in
preparation
of
a
motion
under
1867
(a).
now,
under
right
inspection
does
not
impose
an
undue
administrative
burden,
and
district
court
clerk
need
only
maintain
a
copy
of
the
list
available
for
inspection,
and
we
do
not
think
for
an
inspection
will
be
used
for
delay
because
the
time
periods
imposed
by
the
act
effectively
preclude
that.
and
we
do
not
think
there
is
any
substantial
risk
that
inspection
will
be
used
for
tampering
because
the
sheer
number
of
names
on
the
master
and
qualified
list
would
effectively
preclude
that.
we
do
not
have
a
comprehensive
survey
of
district
courts,
but
based
on
informal
survey
of
united
states
attorneys
who
we
deal
with,
we
believe
that
most
district
courts
presently
allow
inspections.
now,
whether
or
not
the
error
can
be
deemed
harmless
in
this
case
depends
on
an
analysis
of
the
act.
if
the
act
is
read
as
being
directed
solely
to
prevention
of
systematic
exclusion
or
purposeful
discrimination,
then
we
believe
here
was
harmless
because
the
petitioner
sole
claim
was
that
the
use
of
registered
voter
list
in
colorado
gives
rise
to
a
significant
under-representation
of
certain
groups,
primarily
mexican-americans
or
persons
with
spanish
surnames.
now,
as
i
will
explain
in
a
minute,
we
don't
think
the
act
can
be
read
in
that
way,
but
it
does
have
brought
our
purposes
that
if
we
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
is
directed
at
systematic
exclusion,
petitioner
does
not
state
such
a
claim.
the
federal
jury
plan
contemplates
the
use
of
registered
voter
list
as
the
source
for
perspective
jurors,
and
the
random
selection
is
the
method.
and
that
system
is
in
sharp
contrast
with
the
jury
procedures
that
have
been
founded
constitutes
systematic
exclusion
in
this
court's
decisions.
those
systems,
usually
involved
a
source
for
jurors
that
was
not
racially
neutral
and
they
involved
a
subjective
selection
method,
and
they
produced
one
of
two
results.
they
either
produce
a
total
exclusion
of
a
group
such
as
in
norris
against
alabama,
where
no
negro
had
served
on
a
grand
or
petty
jury
in
the
memory
of
living
witnesses.
or
they
produced
a
progressive
decimation
of
a
class
at
each
stage
of
the
process,
such
as
in
alexander
against
louisiana.
that
systematic
exclusion
denies
a
member
of
a
group
an
opportunity
to
participate,
and
as
this
court
held
in
peters
against
kiff,
it
stigmatizes
the
class
excluded.
voter
list
do
not
exclude
anyone.
any
person
qualified
to
vote
may
simply
by
registering,
obtain
the
opportunity
be
considered
for
jury
service.
now
the
federal
selection
system
resembles
fairly
closely
the
jury
selection
procedure
that
was
in
issue
in
brown
against
allen,
which
is
reported
at
443
united
states
reports,
involving
at
forsyth
county
north
carolina
system.
and
there,
tax
list
were
used
as
the
source
for
perspective
jurors,
and
the
names
were
drawn
by
lot.
and
this
court
held
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
merely
because
negroes
were
underrepresented
in
proportion
to
the
numbers
in
the
population,
so
long
as
the
selection
procedures
were
fair.
congress
could
constitutionally
had
made
voter
list
conclusive,
but
they
did
not
do
so.
and
on
18
--
section
1863
(b)
of
the
act,
congress
provided
that
the
voter
list
were
to
be
supplemented
whenever
necessary
to
foster
the
policies
of
1861,
the
fair
cross
section,
and
1862,
the
prevention
of
discrimination.
mr.
william
l.
patton
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
right
after
the
voting
age
was
changed,
the
act
was
amended
requiring
two
things,
the
emptying
of
the
wheel
and
refilling
the
master
list,
and
now
provides
that
a
person
18
years
of
age
is
qualified
of
jury
service.
now,
we
think
a
party
challenging
the
voter
list
and
contending
that
there's
an
obligation
to
supplement,
there’s
a
heavy
burden.
and
while
we
believe
mr.
gerash
should
be
entitled
to
inspect
the
list
and
make
his
claim,
we
don’t
think
it's
likely
that
he's
going
to
be
able
to
prevail.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that's
right
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
william
l.
patton
yes
sir,
we
do.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
we
believe
the
case
ought
to
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
instructions
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
no
sir,
i
don't
think
it’s
necessary.
i
think
it
might
be
helpful
if
this
court
made
clear
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
that's
right.
mr.
william
l.
patton
well,
i
was
somewhat
puzzled
and
uncertainness
to
what
the
court
was
interested
in,
i
--
let
me
bring
up
one
thing
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
that's
right.
and
it
is
not
an
administrative
burden
on
the
clerk.
he
only
has
to
maintain
a
copy
of
the
list.
and
unless
you
can
look
at
the
list,
you
can't
make
a
challenge
to
the
act.
mr.
william
l.
patton
the
--
well,
under
the
federal
act,
the
process
works
basically
this
way.
you
start
with
a
voter
list,
choose
a
random
selection
from
that
you
send
out
questionnaires,
questionnaires
come
back
and
then
excuses
disqualifications
and
exemptions
are
noted
on
the
questionnaires.
the
practice
has
been
on
the
district
courts
to
permit
inspection
of
the
questionnaires,
and
i
think
that’s
appropriate
because
i
would
--
we
would
take
the
position
that
a
party
wishing
to
challenge
the
act's
procedures
must
show
not
only
that
there's
a
disparity.
but
if
he
wants
to
go
on
and
make
a
challenge
based
on
the
qualified
list,
then
he
would
have
to
look
at
the
questionnaires.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that's
right.
that's
the
way
the
challenge
procedures
were
designed
to
work,
you
looked
at
the
list,
based
on
what
you
find
you
then
do
an
affidavit.
and
if
the
affidavit
doesn't
state
a
claim
then,
then
you're
out
of
luck.
mr.
william
l.
patton
in
our
view
there
is
not.
now
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
that's
right
mr.
justice
stewart,
we
believe
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
no
he
has
to
be
a
defendant
or
the
attorney
general
or
either
party
in
civil
case.
now,
it's
not
based
to
the
act
does
not
preclude
constitutional
challenges
by
other
person,
but
it
wouldn’t
govern
whether
there's
a
right
to
inspect
a
list
in
those
cases
and
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
they
existed
before
the
act,
that's
right.
that
is
the
only
issue
in
the
case
and
we
think
it
should
be
remanded.
mr.
william
l.
patton
nothing
mr.
justice
white,
except
in
1966
in
house
debates
on
a
previous
bill
that
was
never
enacted.
a
statement
was
made
that
inspection
might
be
use
for
a
delay
or
tampering,
and
as
i
have
stated,
we
don't
think
that's
a
substantial
risk.
it's
most
inefficient
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
there
is
a
time
limit,
and
it's
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
seven
days
in
any
event
before
the
voir
dire
begins,
and
the
lists
are
so
large
that
it's
best
and
inefficient
way
of
tampering,
so
we're
not
concerned
about
that.
now,
we
think
it
should
be
sent
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
with
instructions
to
remand
with
the
district
court
for
action
on
petitioner’s
motion
to
quash
the
rate
after
he's
had
an
opportunity
to
see
the
list.
and
we
may
then
face
the
question
whether
there's
an
obligation
to
supplement,
but
we
don't
face
it
now.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that's
right.
now,
as
a
matter
of
interest
i
--
pleasure
to
inform
the
court
of
a
couple
of
things
that
have
happened
since
this
case
has
been
in
this
court.
i
understand
that
we
don't
have
any
hard
information
except
the
state
of
colorado
has
under
the
uniform
jury
selection
act
which
is
substantially
identical
to
the
federal
act,
or
to
the
supplementation
of
voter
lists.
mr.
william
l.
patton
it
is
--
no,
they
have
done
it,
we
don't
know
whether
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
has
ordered
the
voter
list
be
supplemented
for
jury
selection
in
state
courts.
mr.
william
l.
patton
since
this
case
has
come.
mr.
william
l.
patton
that's
right.
now,
i
understand
it
took
a
year
to
develop
the
supplemental
sources.
and
one
of
the
things
that
we're
concerned
about
in
this
whole
area
is
that
if
a
plan
is
ever
found
to
be
deficient,
it’s
going
to
be
very
difficult
because
it's
not
easy
to
develop
supplemental
sources.
the
judicial
conference
is
working
on
that
problem.
they
are
now
running
in
selected
districts
and
computer
projects
and
that
may
solve
the
problem.
and
in
addition,
the
judicial
conference
has
a
reporting
procedure
in
which
district
courts
around
the
country
report
periodically
with
the
statistical
sample
from
their
master
lists,
and
that
is
monitoring
the
way
the
system
works.
but
we
don't
face
those
difficult
questions
in
this
case.
unless
court
has
any
further
questions
--
mr.
william
l.
patton
there
is
bound
to
be
a
lag.
and
mr.
chief
justice,
we
haven't
had
a
great
year
of
experience
under
the
act.
now
one
reason
that
we
haven't
had
the
experience
is
that
until
1972,
the
questionnaire
did
not
indicate
race,
at
least
the
indication
of
race
was
optional
so
that
if
you
wanted
to
make
a
challenge
that
there's
under
representation
of
racial
groups,
it's
very
difficult
to
do,
and
we
make
it
more
of
those
challenges.
now
during
the
hearings
on
the
bills,
professors
calvin
and
seizle
testified
and
they
recommended
that
private
parties
not
be
allowed
to
enforce
the
supplementation
requirement
that
that
be
handled
by
an
audit
procedure
in
the
act.
their
suggestion
wasn't
followed
and
experience
may
show
that
they
were
right,
but
at
the
present
time,
we're
unable
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
