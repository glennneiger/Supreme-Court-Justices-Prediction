mr.
walter
l.
gerash
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
this
case
involves
the
plain
meaning
of
the
federal
jury
selection
and
service
act
of
1968,
and
more
specifically
with
the
section
1867
(d)
and
(f),
which
deals
with
the
challenging
compliance
with
selection
procedures.
in
essence,
the
issue
in
this
case
is,
did
the
federal
trial
court
error
when
they
denied
a
motion
to
inspect
the
master
list
and
the
--
rather
master
and
qualified
wheel
under
28
u.s.c.
1867
(d)
upon
a
timely
motion
accompanied
with
a
sworn
affidavit
alleging
noncompliance
with
the
act.
in
that,
there
was
a
systematic
exclusion
of
spanish
surname
persons
qualified
for
jury
duty.
there's
a
subsidiary
question
which
i
don't
feel
it's
necessary
to
reach,
but
it's
implicit
in
the
briefs
and
that
is,
is
this
form
of
requested
relief,
statutory
relief,
under
the
act,
separate
from
a
constitutional
or
collateral
attack.
and
the
answer
to
both
questions
is
yes.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
undisputed
prior
to
the
trial
of
a
drug
case;
counsel
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
a
motion
to
inspect
the
jury
wheels.
and
pursuant
to
the
statute,
he
filed
an
affidavit
of
an
experience
that
he
had
in
boulder,
colorado
which
is
a
county,
city
and
county
about
20
miles
from
denver.
and
in
that
--
he
had
a
case
before
the
state
court,
and
at
that
time
the
state
law
mimicked
the
federal
jury
selection
and
service
act
and
that
it
utilized
the
voting
registration
list
as
a
basic
source
list.
and
the
affidavit
that
i
filed
is
contained
in
the
appendix
in
the
--
page
15,
and
in
essence
without
going
through
the
appendix,
the
conclusion
was
that
this
group,
that
the
spanish
surnamed
group
were
underrepresented
by
over
50%.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well,
relying
on
human
nature,
it's
self-corrective
because
the
opposite
sex
does
the
same
thing.
and
so
we
--
statistically
taking
usually
take
care
of
that
situation.
it
cancels
one
another.
it's
really
not
a
problem
statistically.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well,
what
happened
is
of
course
this
court
certified
the
issue
to
be
spanish
surnames
and
did
not
certify
a
age
grouping
or
in
this
case
blacks.
of
course,
in
this
specific
case,
being
denied
the
list
we
couldn't
make
any
statistical
analysis
in
the
federal
district
court.
but
the
affidavit
--
there
was
testimony
by
professor
bargrow
from
the
university
of
denver
to
the
effect
that
these
groups
were
also
underrepresented.
but
that
wasn't
--
of
course
that
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court.
the
court
only
certified
the
spanish
surname
cognizable
group
under
hernandez
versus
texas.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
yes,
it
does.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
right.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
right.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well,
there'd
been
some
studies
made
and
however
the
statisticians
and
mathematicians
do
have
a
error
of
correction
and
they
take
that
into
consideration.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well
therefore,
it
would've
been
impossible
in
hernandez
versus
texas,
i
suppose,
to
come
to
the
systematic
exclusion
of
constitutional
argument.
but
i
don't
know
the
--
they
do
if
they
do,
do
that
in
the
mathematicians
sometimes
in
cross-examination
explain.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
no.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
that's
correct.
the
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
that's
right.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
the
u.s.
census
met
with
that
problem
also
and
i
quote
a
u.s.
census
finding
of
the
voting
characteristics
of
persons
in
the
1968
elections.
and
naturally,
when
they
make
their
random
sampling
and
they
go
into
the
homes
and
count
heads,
they
actually
inquire
of
national
intermarriage,
and
their
statistics
are
balanced
accordingly
in
their
census
figures.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
yes,
but
it
projected
over
statistically
hundreds
and
thousands
of
persons,
it's
a
pretty
good
figure.
of
course
the
amicus
brief
indicates
that
spanish-americans
have
been
underrepresented
even
in
our
census
figures.
so
theoretically
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
that's
correct.
and,
however
since
blacks,
negroes
have
anglo
names,
it's
sometimes
very
difficult
for
a
poor
person
to
look
at
8000
names
unless
their
names
--
unless
their
race
is
designated
in
the
registration
procedure,
which
it
is
now
under
the
new
act.
and
i
feel
we
have
a
very
good
act
and
we
have
a
very
good
self-executing
act
and
i'd
like
to
deal
with
that.
anyhow,
the
affidavit
appears
on
its
face
to
be
okay.
in
fact
my
brother
patton
indicates
that
he's
never
seen
a
better
affidavit
and
i
have
to
emphasize
that
this
was
a
threshold
problem,
in
other
words
we
never
got
a
hearing.
we
never
had
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
noncompliance
with
the
act.
we
were
denied
the
list
outright,
and
judge
arraj
is
an
excellent
judge,
excellent
trial
judge
who
have
tried
many
cases
before
him.
but
he
stated
this
on
page
24
of
the
appendix
“well
that’s
later.
i
want
to
look
at
the
qualified
jury
list
in
order
to
have
a
hearing,
in
other
words
i
want
a
hearing.
you're
not
going
to
have
a
hearing
in
this
case.
if
you
want
to
look
at
the
jury
list
some
time,
we
will
hire
some
extra
help.
and
if
you
come
down,
you
can
peek
at
it
all
you
want
to
but
it's
not
going
to
be
had
in
this
case.
i
have
told
you,
we
concede
that
the
percentage
of
jurors
that
are
black
or
spanish
in
surname
are
not
a
pro
rata
percentage
that
those
groups
bear
to
the
total
population,
we
concede
that,
alright?”
that's
on
the
record.
mr.
gerash
“my
position
is
though,
if
i
can
show
it
is
so
overwhelming,
it
is
a
violation
of
due
process,
and
i
can't
do
it.
i
have
nothing
to
go
up
to
the
tenth
circuit
if
i
lose
this
case
to
show
that
it
is
substantial.”
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
page
24.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
of
the
appendix.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
and
the
court
never
ruled
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
and
there
was
no
record
on
review
and
we
had
no
hearing.
and
fortunately
or
unfortunately,
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
illegal
drug
dispensing,
and
we
are
here.
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words,
in
other
words,
the
words
meaning
what
they
say
in
the
appendix
of
petitioner's
brief
has
laid
out
the
statute
that
has
the
declaration
of
policy.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
page
1
(a)
which
would
be
page
50
of
petitioner's
brief.
the
declaration
of
policy
of
the
united
states
is
declared
to
have
a
random
fair
cross
section
of
the
community,
and
that
there
should
not
be
any
--
that
all
jurors
should
be
able
to
serve
regardless
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
national
origin
or
economic
status.
in
fact
prior
to
the
act,
one
year
prior
to
the
act,
the
court
fifth
circuit,
speaking
through
rabinowitz
put
the
key
man
in
his
coffin
and
this
act
buried
the
coffin
--
buried
the
key
man
in
the
coffin.
and
it
was
very
salutary,
one
cannot
helped
being
very
impressed
with
our
legislators
in
drafting
this
act,
and
it's
a
good
act
and
it
has
a
self-correcting
mechanism,
and
that
is
if
the
voter
registration
list
in
a
specific
geographic
area
do
not
substantially
represent
a
cross
section
and
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
mirror,
the
court,
the
judicial
counsel,
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
in
its
rule-making
powers
and
the
chief
judge
himself
can
add
new
list
that
would
broaden
this
mirror
that
is
being
polished
up.
in
other
words,
it's
not
necessary
to
have
a
constitutional
attack.
the
act
itself
is
self-purifying.
the
common
law
lawyers
in
essence
shine
up
the
mirror.
they
bevel
the
reflection,
and
if
the
reflection
is
bad,
if
the
reflection
doesn't
reflect
the
cross
section
of
the
community,
then
the
court
may
polish
up
its
own
mirror,
so
to
say
by
selecting
other
lists.
it's
a
very
viable
act,
it's
a
very
vital
act
and
i
feel
that
democratization
of
the
jury,
this
gift
given
to
us
by
magna
carta
is
very
strong
now
and
has
a
--
will
have
a
very
great
history
in
the
future.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
i'm
speaking
about
our
act,
the
federal
act.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
exactly.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
exactly.
we're
not
concerned
with
the
jury,
because
the
jury
in
fact
in
this
case
there
were
no
chicano's
that
tried
john
test.
however,
statistically
it
would
be
invalid
to
say
because
if
the
jury
doesn't
have
to,
it's
invalid.
i
was
attempting
to
get
at
the
8000
names
to
make
a
statistically
viable
analysis
and
i
was
denied
that
right.
counsel
agrees
there
was
error.
however,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
the
fact
that
we
feel
that
this
act
has
to
be
read
as
a
whole,
because
the
act
monitors
statistics.
the
act
enables
lawyers
both
the
government
and
the
defense
attorneys
in
1867
on
page
9
(a)
of
the
plaintiff's,
or
rather
the
petitioner's
brief
wherein
it
talks
about
challenging
compliance
with
the
selection
procedures.
it
clearly
gives
both
sides
to
file
motions
seven
days
prior
to
trial,
and
it
gives
them
the
parties
in
a
case
shall
be
allowed
to
inspect,
reproduce
and
copy
such
records
of
papers
at
all
reasonable
times
during
the
preparation
and
pendency
of
such
a
motion.
the
act
recognizes
that
this
is
an
exclusive
means
by
which
a
person
accused
of
a
federal
crime,
or
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
civil
party
may
challenge
any
jury
in
that
he
was
not
selected
in
conformity
with
any
of
the
provisions.
and
there're
many
other
provisions.
there
are
disqualifications.
there
are
excuses
that
may
reflect
perhaps
a
bias
in
some
manner.
however,
the
act
specifically
delineates
that
this
shall
not
preclude
any
other
remedies,
especially
constitutional
attacks.
so
we
claim
in
this
case
that
not
only
that
we
conform
to
the
literally,
to
the
statute,
but
we
alleged
the
constitutional
dimension
that
we
felt
that
we
would
be
able
to
prove
if
we
were
allowed
into
the
hearing
room
and
took
a
look
at
the
statistics.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
and
in
fact,
both
parties
asked
that
it
be
remanded
with
instructions
to
allow
us
to
look
the
list
to
see
if
that
we
hope
we’d
be
proved
wrong.
however,
there's
a
little
corollary
and
that
is
that
it
seems
that
the
ninth
circuit
and
second
circuit
have
been
requiring
the
affidavit
or
the
proof,
the
proof,
to
have
a
constitutional
dimension
which
as
i
read
the
act
and
the
history
of
the
act
is
really
not
so.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
that's
right.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
no.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
exactly.
and
if
i
prove
that
there
is
systematic
exclusion,
i
have
a
right
to
new
trial
with
a
fresh
--
with
a
panel
that
perhaps
has
a
better
statistical
cross
section.
we
don't
want
a
mirror,
as
justice
white
indicated
in
the
--
one
of
these
cases.
we
don't
want
a
mirror.
we
just
want
a
--
we
want
a
fair
cross
section
just
what
the
statute
calls
for,
and
these
things
differ
--
will
differ
in
every
community.
they
will
differ
in
the
south.
they
will
differ
when
people
get
politically
apathetic.
and
of
course
we're
not
even
entertaining
the
question
that
could
be
serious
later
on,
and
that
is,
why
should
voting
be
the
criteria
of
serving
any
jury.
30
million
people
don't
engage
in
the
political
processes
for
whatever
reason.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well,
the
act
says
you
could
use
voter
registration
list
or
at
people
voted
in
the
last
election.
of
course
in
colorado,
they
are
purged
if
they
don't
vote
in
an
election.
they
don't
even
--
they're
just
purged
from
the
list.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
that's
right.
that's
basically
--
i
would
add
that
the
colorado
experience,
when
the
chief
justice
supplemented
the
list
sua
sponte,
i
tested
in
fort
morgan
in
another
county
and
i
found
it
not
wanting
at
all.
it
was
self-correcting
and
there
was
no
--
there
was
inadequate
cross
section
given
the
defendants,
and
i
was
very
satisfied.
so,
i
think
this
heralds
a
lot
of
security
and
a
lot
of
good
predictions
with
the
functioning
of
our
federal
act.
finally,
i'd
just
like
to
indicate
that
the
fifth
circuit
seems
to
be
particularly
sensitive
and
particularly
sophisticated
in
this
area,
and
judge
gwin
in
his
article
in
20
mercer
law
review
and
in
his
opinion
u.s.
versus
the
de
alba
conrado
indicated
that
there
really
two
different
remedies.
there's
a
constitutional
remedy
and
a
statutory
remedy.
they're
not
exclusive,
they
may
overlap.
and
he
also
indicated
that
based
upon
his
studies
that
the
further
democratization
of
the
jury
has
maximized
the
jury's
greatness
and
raised
it
to
a
new
height
of
dignity.
and
i
feel
that
common
law
lawyers
should
be
given
the
opportunity
to
improve
the
mirror
without
throwing
it
out
in
a
constitutional
attack,
but
working
with
the
court
personnel
and
the
judges
in
order
to
perfect
our
jury
--
federal
jury
system.
i'd
like
to
save
--
if
there’s
going
to
be
any
rebuttal,
i'd
like
to
save
some
time.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
thank
you.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
just
a
comment
on
justice
white's
mention
of
fishing
expedition.
number
one,
i
think
the
sworn
statement
specifically
states
that
the
sworn
statement
must
have
facts
if
true
would
constitute
a
substantial
failure
to
comply
with
the
provisions
of
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
yes,
you
have
to
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
you
have
to
--
i
would
liken
it
a
probable
cause
affidavit
because
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well,
i
suppose
i
should
be
on
this
side
and
he
should
be
on
my
side.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well,
i
don't
think
it
was,
because
my
affidavit
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
it
wasn't,
that's
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
i'm
just
stating
that
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
not
really,
no.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well
he
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
he
stated
that
it
was
more
sufficient
than
most
affidavits
he's
ever
seen,
not
the
best.
i
don't
want
to
quibble
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
this
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well,
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
i'll
stand
on
the
affidavit.
i
think
the
affidavit
is
sufficient,
but
the
lower
court
never
passed
on
it.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
right.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
and
i
had
to
go
to
another
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
yes,
and
i
think
that
prevents
the
fishing
expedition.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
about
20
counties.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
it
would
be
economically
impossible.
every
criminal
defendant
would
have
to
be
a
wealthy
man.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well,
then
i'll
have
to
move
and
change
my
position
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well,
i'll
have
to
agree
--
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
i'll
have
to
agree
with
him,
but
the
point
is
if
a
lawyer
swears
under
oath,
facts
that
if
true
would
be
a
substantial
noncompliance
and
he
has
no
way
of
really
approving
that
other
than
an
experience
with
the
vote
of
registration
list
in
a
county
that
comprises
one
of
the
federal
counties.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
the
statute
doesn't
say
that.
but
i
suppose
that's
his
position.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
well,
as
i
read
(d),
1867
(d)
the
motion
must
accompany
--
an
affidavit
must
accompany
the
motion.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
l.
gerash
thank
you.
