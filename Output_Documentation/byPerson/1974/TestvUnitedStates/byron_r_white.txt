justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
suggested
that
sometime
ago
when
we
took
this
case
that
we
shouldn't
take
it
that
it
should
be
remanded?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
perhaps
should
be
putting
the
questions.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
you
say
that
the
act
is
to
be
construed
to
mean
that
anyone
can
inspect
the
jury
list
and
what's
on
the
wheel
by
saying
“i
may
want
to
file
a
motion,
and
in
order
to
find
out
if
i
do
or
not,
i
can
go
on
this
fishing
expedition
in
the
jury
records.”
and
you
say
that's
exactly
what
congress
contemplated?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
does
that
include
all
the
records
of
individual
exemptions?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
error
in
this
case
was
that
although
the
affidavit
was
insufficient,
he
should
have
had
an
opportunity
to
present
a
better
one
if
he
could
after
inspecting
the
list?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
has
got
to
be
a
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
you
have
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
on
account
of
your
argument,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
doesn't
make
out
his
case
to
reenter
the
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
gerash,
do
you
have
to
file
an
affidavit?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
you
must
make
out
in
your
sworn
statement
you
must
have
allegations
in
there
that
would
entitle
your
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
justice
rehnquist
asked
your
colleague
if
that
was
so,
it
is
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then,
your
affidavit
was
insufficient?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
opponent
says
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
he
turned
on
then
we
do
have
an
issue
here.
you
have
to
disagree
between
you
and
the
government
on
a
sufficiency
of
your
affidavit.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
why
isn't
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
your
affidavit
is
sufficient,
he
said
it
wasn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
say
there’s
an
issue
here
before
the
court,
before
we
can
remand,
we
must
pass
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit.
if
it
was
insufficient,
there's
going
to
be
no
remand.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
conclusions
of
what
you've
just
said,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
the
point.
you've
just
said
that
you
must
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
in
your
affidavit
before
you're
entitled
with
the
list?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
have
to
completely
agree
to
that,
and
i
have
felt
the
nerve,
his
was
and
yours
was
that
all
you
needed
when
you
wanted
to
inspect
was
to
tell
the
court
officials
that
i'm
going
to
file
a
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
government's
position
is
i
thought
yours
was
that
1867
(f)
said
that
you
can
inspect
to
the
purpose
of
preparing
the
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
certainly
much.
but
1867
(f)
says
you
can
inspect
in
order
to
prepare
the
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
all
right.
