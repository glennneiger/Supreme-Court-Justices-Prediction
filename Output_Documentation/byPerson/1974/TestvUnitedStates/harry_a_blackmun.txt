mr.
gerash,
let
me
ask
for
a
little
help.
in
this
case
and
in
others
where
we
always
have
references
to
people
with
spanish
surnames,
suppose
a
woman
named
perez
marries
a
man
named
jones,
now
their
offspring
is
not
a
person
with
a
spanish
surname
if
they
follow
our
system
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
question
number
two,
you
motion
it
seems
to
me
is
directed
to
persons
with
spanish
surnames
and
students
and
blacks
using
your
phrase,
and
then
later,
persons
under
the
age
of
35.
and
then
in
your
affidavit,
you
speak
to
spanish
surnames
and
used
under
30
and
students
and
workers.
i
wonder
whether
there's
a
little
inconsistency
between
the
supporting
affidavit
and
the
motion.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
i
take
it
then
you're
saying
the
inconsistency
which
i
believe
is
present
between
your
supporting
affidavit
and
the
motion
is
irrelevant
because
we're
only
speaking
of
spanish
surnames
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
feel
that
in
response
to
my
first
question
that
the
thing
balances
out?
