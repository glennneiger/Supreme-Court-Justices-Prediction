we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1908,
cort
against
ash.
mr.
rome,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
reserve
the
balance.
mr.
berger.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
what
extent
is
the
content
of
the
exhibits
relevant
to
the
case
in
its
present
posture
in
your
view?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
relevant
to
go
and
perhaps
this
from
your
point
of
view.
we
haven't
reached
this
stage,
yet.
but
would
it
be
relevant
at
all
that
to
inquire
whether
this
content
would
be
appropriate
in
a
lecture
of
a
political
science
professor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
the
same
--
the
same
might
be
said
with
reference
to
the
lecture
that
i
was
suggesting
by
hypothetically
that
if
the
professor
wants
to
make
a
particular
speech.
he
can
make
it
anywhere
he
wants
but
he
can't
make
it
--
he
can't
make
it
as
professor
in
the
lecture
hall
at
the
state
supported
university,
is
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
your
point
is
now
that
the
content
of
this
is
really
irrelevant
in
spite
of
what
you
said
about
its
getting
some
support
to
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll,
it's
rarely
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
rarely
known
to
decide
constitutional
questions
from
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
if
that
means
that
you
got
to
between
4
and
500
district
judges
who
might
be
dealing
separately
and
independently
with
the
question?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
ultimately,
we
bring
the
uniformity
here,
don't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that's
quite
a
lot
of
expended
effort
before
it
happens.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
assume
for
a
moment
right
on
that
that
a
corporate
officer
is
found
guilty
of
violating
statute
on
11
counts
and
the
district
judge
imposes
an
$110,000.00
maximum
penalty
available.
do
you
suggest
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
suggest
that
the
stockhold
--
a
stockholder
would
not
have
a
remedy
to
bring
suit
against
him
to
make
him
reimburse
the
corporation
for
the
fine
imposed
for
his
misconduct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
not
quite.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
went
cir
--
you
went
to
short
circuit
that
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
whose
instance
are
you
suggesting
the
criminal
process
proceed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
you
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
district
judge
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
present
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i'm
addressing
my
question
to
you
on
the
basis
of
saying
your
statement
that
there
is
no
remedy
for
the
stockholder.
there's
quite
a
good
remedy
ultimately,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
berger.
mr.
rome.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
73-1908,
cort
against
