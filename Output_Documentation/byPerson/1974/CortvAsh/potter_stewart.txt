what
would
you
think
the
law
means
when
it
says,
the
commission
has
primary
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
the
civil
enforcement
of
such
provisions
and
such
provisions
includes
610,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
does
that
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
the
safety
appliance
act?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose,
it
wouldn't
be
hard
to
either
discern
from
legislative
history
or
to
infer
from
one's
reasoning
processes
that
the
purpose
of
almost
any
federal
criminal
statute
and
of
which
there
are
hundreds
if
not
thousands.
and
i
--
it
seem
to
me
that
tests
that
you
told
us,
you
submitted
to
us
is
appropriate
test
would
result
in
a
private
cause
of
action
based
on
almost
every
criminal
statute
in
18
united
states
code?
justice
potter
stewart
i
hope
you
do.
but
i
--
tell
me
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
let's
apply
your
test.
you
have
this
very
broad
test
of
yours,
you
can't
find
anything
a
legislative
history
to
the
--
to
the
contrary
that
would
militate
against
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
civil
--
being
a
civil
cause
of
action.
well,
then
why
isn't
they
want
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
who's
to
judge
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
if
it's
if
one
dollar
--
one
year
penitentiary
offense
is
not
adequate
but
if
it
is
10
years
it
is
and
then
there's
no
civil
cause
of
action?
justice
potter
stewart
let
the
congress
to
say
what
the
penalty,
if
it's
criminal
penalty
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
having
done
so?
justice
potter
stewart
by
definition,
it's
adequate
because
that's
what
congress
has
said?
