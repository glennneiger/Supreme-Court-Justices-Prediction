justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
also
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
petitioner
cort,
who
is
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
of
bethlehem
steel
corporation,
he
and
his
follow
directors
authorized
the
use
of
corporate
moneys
during
the
1972
presidential
campaign
to
pay
for
political
advertisements
in
various
newspapers
and
magazines
purporting
to
refute
statements
of
the
democratic
candidate,
george
mcgovern,
that
corporations
did
not
carry
their
fair
share
of
the
tax
burden.
respondent,
ash,
is
a
bethlehem
stockholder.
he
filed
this
suit
before
election
day
in
1972,
charging
that
the
use
of
corporate
moneys
to
pay
for
the
advertisements
violated
the
criminal
statute
section
610,
prohibiting
corporations
from
making
expenditures
in
connection
with
any
presidential
election.
and
he
sought,
both
as
citizen
and
stockholder,
injunctive
relief
against
those
expenditures
in
connection,
not
alone
with
the
1972
presidential
election
but
also
in
connection
with
any
future
presidential
campaigns,
and
he
also
sought
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
in
favor
of
the
corporation.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
held
that
this
private
cause
of
action
whether
brought
by
respondent,
ash,
as
a
citizen
to
secure
injunctive
relief
or
as
a
stockholder
to
secure
injunctive
or
derivative
damage
relief
is
a
proper
remedy
to
address
the
violation
of
the
criminal
statute,
section
610,
prohibiting
corporate
expenditures
in
presidential
election
campaigns.
well,
we
reverse
on
both
aspects
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
as
to
the
injunctive
relief
which
at
this
state
of
course
concerns
only
future
elections,
we
hold
that
the
judgment
must
be
reversed
in
light
of
the
creations
since
the
court
of
appeals
decision
by
the
congress
of
the
federal
election
commission.
the
amendments
creating
that
commission
expressly
require
that
complaints
of
irregularities
in
the
future
campaigns
must
be
filed
with
the
commission
and
empowers
the
commission
to
decide
whether
to
request
the
attorney
general
to
file
a
civil
action
for
injunctive
relief.
since
our
duty
is
to
decide
this
case
according
to
the
law
existing
at
the
time
of
our
decision,
respondent
then
must
file
with
the
commission
any
complaints
he
may
make
of
irregularities
in
connection
with
future
campaigns
and
cannot
maintain
this
action
at
this
juncture
for
injunctive
relief.
we
also
reverse
the
judgment
insofar
as
respondent
seeks
damages
derivatively
as
stockholder,
although
the
fact
that
violation
of
a
criminal
statute
is
charged
does
not
necessarily
preclude
implication
of
a
private
cause
of
action
for
damages,
we
can
find
no
indication
whatever
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
1970
amendments
that
suggest
a
congressional
intention
to
vest
in
corporate
shareholders
a
private
federal
right
to
sue
for
damages
for
its
violation
if
they
have
such
a
right
they
must
seek
it
under
state
law.
