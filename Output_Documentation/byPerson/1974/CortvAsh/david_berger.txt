mr.
david
berger
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
may
i
first
answer
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
to
respondent,
to
petitioner's
counsel.
it
is
true
sir
that
the
new
act
uses
the
phrase
“primary
jurisdiction”
and
that
is
going
to
be
a
keystone
of
my
argument.
to
the
extent
of
which
the
new
act
sheds
any
light
cross
or
cross-eyed
on
this
problem,
it
is
in
favor
of
the
position
which
i
advocate
here
today
because
as
the
joint
committee
conference
report
says
and
i've
quoted
it
on
page
35
of
my
brief.
this
was
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
that
private
citizens
would
exhaust
their
administrative
remedies
and
as
congressman
bradimus
(ph)
put
it
first,
which
means
of
course,
as
a
precondition
to
bringing
a
private
right
of
action
or
cause
of
action.
now,
may
it
please
the
court?
i
disagree
with
my
friend's
characterization
of
what
the
lower
court
did
here.
the
petitioner's
argument
proceeded
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
had
granted
summary
judgment
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
below
respondent
here.
it
did
no
such
thing.
the
court
of
and
may
i
say
on
the
constitutional
point
as
a
footnote,
the
district
judge
never
even
mention
the
constitutionality
much
less
passed
on
it
or
addressed
the
question.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
address
the
constitutional
question
so
that
there
is
before
this
honorable
court
now
a
decision
which
merely
set
remands
the
case
to
the
trial
court
for
a
trial.
there's
not
only
is
there
an
insufficient
record
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
question,
there's
no
record.
may
i
further
point
out
your
honors
that
the
posture
of
a
case
is
extremely
significant
in
addition
to
what
i
have
just
said,
“my
friend
has
correctly
told
you
that
the
complaint
averred
a
plan
on
the
part
of
the
defendants,
bethlehem
steel
corporation
and
its
directors
to
use
the
vast
resources
of
that
corporation
for
the
specific
partisan
political
purpose
of
influencing
the
1972
election
for
one
of
the
candidates.
that's
what
the
complaint
alleged
and
it
said,
using
the
good
old
lawyer's
english
inter
alia,
the
actions
taken
pursuant
to
the
plan
included
the
ad
which
the
petitioner
have
referred
to.
that
ad
was
widely
published
throughout
the
united
states.
pamphlets
of
mr.
cort's
speech,
pamphlets
were
distributed
and
reprints
of
the
speech
were
very
widely
distributed.
it
happens
therefore,
that
because
of
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction.
we
have
not
only
the
averments
of
the
complaint
but
we
also
have
admissions
by
the
defendants
of
certain
facts
included
within
which
are
these
publications
which
i
have
described.
but
i
would
put
before
your
honors,
the
issue
as
follows.
the
first
question
is
whether
or
not
the
complaint
states
a
valid
cause
of
action
for
violation
of
section
610
of
the
act.
secondly,
whether
the
facts
averting
the
complaint
and
already
admitted
make
out
a
prima
facie
of
a
violation
of
section
610;
and
thirdly,
if
your
honor
agrees
--
if
your
honors
agree
with
me
on
those
first
two
questions,
whether
the
act
section
610
is
unconstitutional
facially
or
as
applied
by
the
third
circuit.
your
honor,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
entirely
correct
in
observing
that
the
court
below
did
not
grant
any
relief
nor
did
it
emanate
that
whatever
kind
of
relief
that
was
requested
by
the
plaintiffs
in
the
district
court
whether
by
way
of
injunction
or
otherwise
was
proper
and
correct
and
should
be
granted,
all
it
said
was
let
the
matter
go
back
to
judge
troutman
for
a
full
trial.
i
--
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
i
emphasized
that
may
i
please
your
honor
justice
powell
because
i'm
about
to
turn
to
the
underlying
policy
of
the
statute
and
that
is
to
prevent
the
application
of
vast
resources
improperly
to
influence
the
federal
electoral
process,
that's
why
i
emphasized.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
david
berger
i
don't
find
any
exception
but
i
find
that
this
court
has
put
a
gloss
upon
the
interpretation
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
has
said
in
the
uaw
case.
it's
got
to
be
active
electioneering.
i'm
unaware
of
any
nonprofit
corporation
which
correctly
could
actively
electioneer.
mr.
david
berger
to
a
certain
extent,
i
am
sir.
mr.
david
berger
i
would
say
that,
if
the
league
of
women
voters
assuming
it
were
a
corporation
and
it
sent
these
messages
out
to
its
own
stockholders.
if
that
what's
your
honors
are
telling
me,
then
that
is
explicitly
accepted
by
the
act,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
if
it
could
be
arguably
urge
that
that
would
violate,
that's
not
this
case.
we
do
not
have
that
case
here
your
honor
and
i'm
not
asking
your
honors
to
make
a
decision
on
anything
except
the
averments
in
this
case.
it
may
very
well
be
that
in
that
kind
of
case
came
up.
there
would
be
a
reason
for
concluding
that
the
act,
it
was
not
within
the
act's
coverage
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
david
berger
only
mr.
chief
justice
to
the
extent
that
they
constitute
admissions
already
of
record
but
in
my
view
of
the
case,
it's
the
averments
of
the
complaint
that
count.
and
these
averments
laid
ad
substance
to
these
admissions
add
substance
to
the
averments
in
the
complaint.
i
must
say,
i
quite
agree
with
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
that
taken
in
the
context
in
which
these
ads,
this
speech,
reprint
of
the
speech,
and
the
pamphlets
appear
that
under
all
the
circumstances,
a
jury
and
this
was
a
request
for
a
jury
trial.
a
jury
could
reasonably
conclude
that
this
constituted
act
of
electioneering
for
one
of
the
candidates.
now,
the
argument
made
by
the
defendants
in
the
court
below
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
simply
because
the
name
of
a
name
candidate
was
not
mentioned
there
could
be
no
violation
of
the
act.
nothing
could
be
further
from
correct
because
as
chief
judge
seitz
pointed
out
in
the
third
circuit,
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
circumstances
and
if
a
reader
of
this
material
of
average
intelligence
would
perceive
or
could
perceive
that
it
was
indeed
a
partisan
proclamation
on
behalf
of
one
of
the
two
candidates,
then
simply
because
neither
candidates
name
was
mentioned
would
give
no
immunity
from
the
violation
of
the
act
or
the
coverage
of
the
act.
mr.
david
berger
your
honors,
anybody
can
say
what
was
in
these
materials.
mr.
cort
could
say
it.
the
corporation
can
say
it.
the
shareholders
can
say
it.
the
directors
can
say
it.
the
officers
can
say
that.
all
of
this
act
whose
constitutionality
you're
asked
to
destroy
today,
thus,
is
to
say
that
if
they
want
to
exercise
that
freedom
of
speech,
let
them
use
your
own
money
and
not
the
money
of
the
shareholders.
that's
all
this
act
does.
now,
may
i
proceed
with
your
honor's
permission
--
mr.
david
berger
that
maybe.
but
if
the
--
if
--
if
he
will
require
to
use
of
a
different
room
and/or
let
say,
if
he
--
if
he
had
to
make
his
speech
on
his
own
time
instead
among
the
school's
time.
i
don't
think
that
would
call
into
play
the
first
amendment.
mr.
david
berger
well,
i
wouldn't
call
it
entirely
irrelevant.
i
say
two
things
about
it.
i
say
first,
the
case
must
be
considered
on
the
basis
of
the
averments
and
the
complaint,
and
the
aver
very
clearly,
and
plainly,
and
give
notice
to
the
defendants
under
the
federal
rules
that
what
is
charged
is
precisely
what
this
court
has
said
in
pipefitters
for
example,
by
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
powell,
i
believe
agreed
it
to
that
extent
would
constitute
a
violation
of
section
610.
now,
what
was
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
the
preliminary
injunction
motion
is
relevant
in
showing
that
the
complaint
was
not
just
something
that
was
frivolous
or
thought
up
in
somebody's
head.
there
was
serious
basis
for
the
averments.
i
may
say
another
thing
that
in
the
posture
of
the
procedure.
in
my
judgment,
what
brought
about
the
confusion
here
is
that
the
lower
court
was
under
the
impression.
i'm
talking
now
about
the
district
court
that
simply
because
the
district
judge
denied
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
which
was
based
essentially
on
the
stipulation
of
facts
which
they
admitted
to
that
that
foreclose
the
plaintiff
from
proving
the
whole
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
still
pending
is
the
issue
of
the
right
of
the
plaintiff
for
full
discovery
and
an
evidentiary
hearing.
the
district
judge
and
the
one
paragraph
order
on
page
887
denied
the
right
to
trial,
denied
the
right
to
discovery,
denied
the
right
to
evidentiary
hearing,
and
simply
summarily
dismissed
the
case.
now,
all
the
third
circuit
did
was
sent
it
back
for
trial.
now
with
your
honor's
permission,
i
would
like
to
address
the
private
cause
of
action
point
because
i
agree
with
mr.
justice
brennan.
that
might
be
an
easy
way
out
but
this
court
has
never
been
known
to
take
the
easy
way
out.
mr.
david
berger
that's
right
and
i
would
not
ask
your
honors
to
decide
it.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
decided
today
or
in
this
record.
mr.
david
berger
need
not
be
decided
on
this
issue.
all
i
ask
--
mr.
david
berger
i
think
you
should
disagree
with
them
or
not
--
mr.
david
berger
and
in
that
event,
i
think
you
should
agree
with
me
that
the
averments
of
the
complaint
and
the
record
as
it
is
showing
off
to
go
the
fact
finder
to
determine
whether
there's
been
a
violation
of
section
610.
and
that
kind
of
interpretation
of
the
act
is
not
unconstitutional
because
it
amounts
to
say
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
mr.
david
berger
right.
mr.
david
berger
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
david
berger
i
did
know
that
they
didn't
pass
on
---
mr.
david
berger
the
third
circuit
didn't
reach
that
point.
they
said,
we're
sending
the
whole
thing
back
to
judge
troutman.
mr.
david
berger
they
didn't
reach
the
constitutional
point
your
honor
with
the
due
deference,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
they
didn't
get
into
that.
they
got
into
the
--
the
real
gist
of
it
was
the
private
cause
of
action,
may
it
please
the
court.
and
they
said
that
the
complaint
avers
a
valid
cause
of
action
under
610.
mr.
david
berger
yes.
mr.
david
berger
well,
i
pretty
know
they
didn't.
mr.
david
berger
i
think
--
mr.
david
berger
i
think
--
mr.
david
berger
well,
then
i'm
prepared
to
argue
that
it
is
constitutional.
mr.
david
berger
and
i
would
like
very
briefly
with
your
honor's
permission,
first,
to
cover
their
private
cause
of
action.
i
heard
the
government
lawyer
this
morning
gave
his
analysis
of
the
cases.
i'm
relying
on
the
same
cases
and
they
began
with
texas
and
rigsby.
and
mr.
justice
stewart
wanted
to
know
when
that
was
decided.
it
was
1916
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
241
u.s.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
and
my
analysis
of
these
cases
going
right
on
through
case
in
borak,
wyandotte,
bivens,
and
t.i.m.e.
and
amtrak
is
this.
it
goes
back
to
what
mr.
justice
pitney
said
in
the
rigsby
case,
that
where
there
is
a
federal
statute
and
where
has
been
a
violation
of
that
federal
statute
which
imposes
standards
of
conduct.
this
court
will
fashion
a
remedy
to
write
that
wrong
and
there's
nothing
more,
nothing
startling
about
that.
that's
the
old
common
law
and
indeed
judge
kirkpatrick
in
the
garden
case,
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
in
1946,
decided
the
landmark
decision
on
whether
or
not
a
private
person
could
bring
a
private
cause
of
action
for
violation
of
section
10
(b).
now,
that's
heavily
in
grand
denial
law.
but
he
addressed
that
question
and
went
right
back
to
rigsby
and
cited
the
restatement
of
torts.
that's
all
it's
involved
and
--
mr.
david
berger
no,
quite
aggrieve
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
this
is
base
on
a
violence
of
federal
statute's
act.
mr.
david
berger
no.
the
principle
of
the
common
law
that
where
there
is
a
violation
which
causes
a
wrong
a
corporal
fashion
and
remedy,
that's
all
i
meant.
now,
as
i
analyze
these
cases,
they
come
down
to
this
that
the
allowance
that
the
court
will
allow
the
person
harmed
by
conduct
which
violates
a
federal
statute
which
imposes
standards
of
conduct.
if
the
allowance
of
the
private
cause
of
action
will
effectuate
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
statute
and
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
to
preclude
that.
that's
my
analysis.
now,
--
mr.
david
berger
i
believe
sir
that
the
federal
judicial
system
is
capable
of
bringing
uniformity
in
that
kind
of
situation.
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
basic
reasons
why
the
private
right
of
action
should
be
recognized.
mr.
david
berger
exactly.
yes,
sir.
now,
--
mr.
david
berger
your
honor
chief
justice,
a
lot
less
effort
than
if
you
let
it
just
go
to
50
states.
now
in
cio
in
335
u.s.
1948,
this
court
told
us
what
the
policy
of
the
congress
was
and
what
the
purposes
of
the
act
610
and
its
predecessors
are.
and
there
are
twofold
of
an
equal
importance.
the
first
is
to
protect
the
federal
electoral
process
and
the
second
equally
important,
to
protect
the
shareholder
or
later
a
union
member
against
the
use
of
the
company's
funds
which
he
contributed
toward
the
union
or
those
for
partisan
political
purposes
without
the
consent
of
the
shareholder
or
the
union
member.
those
are
two
congressional
purposes
which
are
involved.
i
--
mr.
david
berger
i
--
your
honor,
i
--
with
all
due
deference
i
disagree.
first,
--
mr.
david
berger
first,
we
--
we're
deciding
this
case
that
i'm
going
on
a
basis
of
the
cases
that
came
before
this
court.
it
is
not
every
criminal
statute.
it
is
a
particular
criminal
statute
had
come
here
and
i
only
analyze
then.
mr.
david
berger
well,
let
me
--
let
me
explain
why
--
mr.
david
berger
because
in
most
instances
the
criminal
penalty
is
adequate.
in
this,
it
is
not.
mr.
david
berger
this
court.
mr.
david
berger
well,
i
mean
that
--
i
mean
what
the
specific
right
is
that's
violated.
i
can't
take
it
on
--
mr.
david
berger
that's
right.
that
congress
has
done
so
--
mr.
david
berger
and
this
court
--
mr.
david
berger
only
to
that
extent.
but
if
the
underlying
purpose
of
congress
can
--
will
be
served
only
if
you
allow
a
private
cause
of
action.
that's
when
you
allow
it
and
that's
what
i'm
arguing
for.
and
i
would
like
to
explain
why
in
this
case
you
have
to
allow
it.
the
criminal
penalties
here
at
$10,000.00
fine,
that's
not
going
to
help
the
shareholder.
that's
a
fine
levied
against
its
own
corporation.
i
submit
that
the
way
you're
going
to
satisfy
the
second
purpose.
which
by
the
way
goes
back
to
1906,
when
president
theodore
roosevelt
send
his
message
to
congress
and
asking
for
the
first
of
these
statutes,
and
then
this
had
been
uniformly
recognized
by
the
three
co-equal
branches
of
our
government,
the
co
--
the
executive,
the
legislative,
and
this
court
itself.
and
i
say
that,
the
only
way
you
can
effectuate
this
very
important
purpose.
we're
not
here
dealing
with
this
--
with
just
an
ordinary
run-of-the-mill
criminal
statute.
the
very
foundation
of
our
democracy,
our
government
has
it
exist
depends
on
the
purity
of
the
federal
electoral
process.
the
very
foundation
of
our
system
of
an
enterprise
and
business
depends
upon
the
recognition
of
what
this
court
has
said
is
the
moral
right
that
officials
of
a
corporation
should
not
misuse
the
money
of
the
corporation
for
purely
partisan
political
purposes.
that
is
the
reason
why
i
submit
that
in
this
case
it
was
correct
to
have
a
private
right
of
action,
not
only
correct
but
absolutely
necessary.
now,
may
i
--
mr.
david
berger
the
government
--
mr.
david
berger
this
is
what
we're
doing
in
this
case.
mr.
david
berger
we're
saying
right
now,
your
honor
--
mr.
david
berger
well,
but
do
that
--
mr.
david
berger
no,
with
due
deference
chief
justice.
we're
saying,
let
the
criminal
process
proceed
but
while
that
proceeds,
let
the
stockholder
make
the
people
who
violated
at
the
law
make
restitution
to
the
corporation.
mr.
david
berger
that's
up
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
david
berger
no,
not
for
the
criminal
process
sir.
all
i
want
for
--
the
--
mr.
david
berger
well,
that's
the
district
judge
is
the
forum
in
which
this
will
be
tried.
mr.
david
berger
only,
if
your
honors
will
agree
with
the
third
circuit
that
there
--
this
is
an
appropriate
case
to
say
that
the
private
cause
of
action
exist.
it's
just
like
in
case
in
borak.
the
sec
is
the
expert
commission.
there
were
criminal
penalties
your
honor
provided
in
the
securities
in
exchange
laws,
but
in
case
in
borak,
in
deckert,
in
the
affiliated
ute
case,
and
the
superintendent
banking.
this
court
has
constantly
recognized
that
private
stockholders
have
the
right
to
bring
actions
for
damages
and
indeed,
if
i
could
refer
you
to
the
brief
that
was
argued
this
morning
by
the
sec
itself.
they
recognized
the
validity
of
the
principle
i'm
arguing
for
and
they
said
that,
where
you
have
a
kind
of
statutes
such
as
this
which
prescribes
standards
of
conduct.
its
appropriate
to
have
--
to
recognize
a
private
cause
of
action
because
that
will
stimulate
the
enforcement
and
this
quarters
repeatedly
held
that
the
private
access
by
private
stockholders
is
one
of
the
most
effective
means
of
getting
enforcement
of
that
law.
mr.
david
berger
i
would
have
to
reveal
that
it
might
very
well,
but
i'd
have
to
reveal
the
entire
history
of
the
act
and
see
what
the
underlying
purpose
was.
now,
--
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
that
far
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
david
berger
well
--
mr.
david
berger
well,
mr.
justice
powell,
i
say
and
my
position
is
that
we
only
have
to
sustain
mr.
ash's
right
because
he
is
a
stockholder
and
stockholders
have
not
drawn
out
to
federal
courts
yet.
mr.
david
berger
sec
--
second,
excuse
me
sir.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
david
berger
at
this
point,
i
say
your
honors.
i
only
had
to
uphold
that.
we're
not
--
you
don't
have
to
confront
the
issue
of
registered
voters.
if
you
ask
me
personally,
my
candor
would
compel
me
to
say
that
i
think
they
do
have
the
vote
but
you've
got
nothing
to
worry
about
because
they
do
have
a
right
cause
of
action.
you
have
nothing
to
worry
about.
your
honors
are
well
aware
of
the
tremendous
cause
of
federal
litigation
and
if
you
think
that
suddenly
200
million
voters
are
going
to
rise
to
the
federal
courts
and
bring
suits,
believe
me
that's
not
going
to
happen
in
the
real
world.
mr.
david
berger
i
think
that
there
is
that
possibility
but
i
don't
think
that's
--
mr.
david
berger
i
think
that
is
an
arguable
position
mr.
justice
white
but
i
believe
sir
that
that
--
mr.
david
berger
that
would
not
be
adequate.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
i
would
have
to
say
that
under
delaware
law
sir,
that
the
doctor
of
ultra
vires
would
permit
such
a
state
suit.
but
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
it
would
--
it
does.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
possible
but
it's
inadequate
in
my
submission
that
--
mr.
david
berger
well,
i
said
that
i
believe
that
the
state
law
could
remedy
it
to
a
certain
degree
but
i
also
agree
suggests
that
you're
not
going
to
get
uniformity.
this
involves
a
question
of
federal
law
and
the
expertise
of
a
federal
judiciary
should
be
employed.
in
addition
to
which,
you
have
a
very
serious
problem
that
in
most
states,
judges
are
elected.
they're
subject
to
the
political
process.
one
word
if
i
may
on
amtrak,
i
believe
amtrak
and
time
fall
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
on
private
cause
of
action.
i
agree
with
your
honors
decision
on
amtrak.
in
amtrak,
you
did
not
have
a
statute
which
provided
for
recognized
standards
of
conduct.
you
had
a
completely
new
scheme,
a
concept
for
running
a
written
--
a
national
rail
--
passenger
railroad.
now,
in
that
context,
not
only
with
it
not
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
statute
to
give
passengers
the
right
to
get
discontinuances.
it
would
have
defeated
the
purposes
of
the
act.
because
if
every
passenger
could
run
in
and
get
an
injunction
against
the
discontinuance,
the
--you
would
not
be
able
to
achieve
that
kind
of
rational
rail
passenger
service
including
rational
discontinuances.
that
is
the
reason
why
amtrak
falls
outside
of
the
line
of
cases
without
different
from
them,
without
overruling
them,
and
why
it
is
consistent.
it's
just
totally
distinguishable.
finally,
i
suggest
that
the
case
on
its
face,
the
statute
on
its
face
is
constitutional.
there
is
no
restriction
contrary
to
what
mr.
rome
said
on
any
free
speech
whether
be
the
corporation
and
in
our
brief,
we
have
pointed
out
how
very
carefully
this
statute
was
drawn.
this
act,
the
1971
which
we're
dealing
with
follows
your
honors'
opinion
in
pipefitters,
mr.
justice
brennan.
its
and
it
codifies
precisely
what
the
court
has
said
on
the
traditional
and
constitutional
limits.
the
federal
government
has
very
broad
power
to
regulate
federal
elections
particularly
of
the
president
and
members
of
congress.
in
doing
so,
the
only
question
is
--
was
--
were
reasonable
means
employed.
i
submit
that
when
you
have
a
narrowly
drawn
statute
which
allows
the
corporation
to
say
anything
it
wants
to
its
own
stockholders
and
their
families,
including
partisan
political
thing
which
allows
the
corporation
to
use
its
money,
to
solicit
funds,
and
to
administer
separate
segregated
fund.
and
which
allows
nonpartisan,
get
out
the
vote
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
says
that
if
you
want
to
engage
in
active
electioneering,
you
have
to
use
your
own
money
or
get
the
segregated
funds
from
voluntary
contributions
of
shareholders.
that
doesn't
present
this
horrendous
picture
which
the
petitioners
try
--
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
berger
yes,
sir.
and
i
say
on
the
fifth
amendment
that
everything
that
was
done
here
has
a
rational
basis
to
apply
to
the
great
aggregation
of
wealth
of
the
corporation
and
the
unions,
and
that
there
is
no
necessity
to
include
all
these
other
elements
like
the
league
of
women
voters
and
others
in
the
coverage
of
the
act.
i
don't
think
there's
any
violation
of
fifth
amendment
at
all.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed
no
matter
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
full
trial.
thank
you,
your
honor.
