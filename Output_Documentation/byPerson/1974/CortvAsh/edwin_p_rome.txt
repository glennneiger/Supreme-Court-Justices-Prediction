mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
a
three-judge
panel
of
which
in
a
divided
opinion,
reversed
the

of
summary

which
have
been
entered
by
judge

for

on

of

here.
chief
judge
seitz
writing
for
himself
and
also
for
judge
hastie
reversed
the
grant
of
summary
judgment.
judge
aldisert
wrote
a
dissent.
the
factual
background
of
the
case
is
the
following.
mr.
ash
filed
a
complaint
just
a
little
bit
more
than
five
weeks
before
the
presidential
election
of
november
1972
asserting
a
claim
against
bethlehem
steel
corporation
and
12
of
its
directors
and
senior
executive
officers
claiming
on
behalf
of
himself
as
voter
citizen
and
stockholder
and
derivatively
on
behalf
of
bethlehem
steel
corporation
itself,
claiming
a
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
section
610
on
the
basis
of
a
charged
plan
by
the
defendants
to
violate
610
by
utilizing
the
resources
of
bethlehem
steel
corporation
including
the
expenditure
of
corporate
funds
to
bring
about
a
republican
victory
in
1972.
more
specifically,
there
was
asserted
by
the
plaintiff
below
that
corporate
funds
were
expended
for
ads
which
appeared
in
magazines
of
national
circulation
and
also,
in
newspapers
which
appeared
in
19
towns
where
the
company
had
plans
which
ads
were
said
to
be
blatantly
partisan.
the
ad
in
question
only
one
which
was
attached
to
the
complaint
appears
at
a16
of
the
record
and
also
reproduced
at
the
end
of
the
petitioner's
brief
here.
there
was
also
a
second
count
under
which
pending
jurisdiction
was
asserted
based
on
an
assertion
of
ultra
vires
and
illegality
under
delaware
law.
going
back
again
to
the
same
element
of
expenditure
of
corporate
funds.
injunctive
relief
including
the
corrective
advertising
to
be
placed
at
the
expense
of
the
individual
defendants,
compensatory
in
punitive
damages
as
well
as
attorney's
fees
and
cause
were
sought.
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
sought
which
appears
at
page
17
of
the
record
in
which
there
was
sought
a
prohibition
against
bethlehem
steel
corporation
from
purchasing
or
paying
for
advertising,
identical
to
or
substantially
similar
to
exhibit
a,
that
was
refused
and
thereafter
there
was
an
application
made
for
preliminary
injunctive
relief
and
i
would
invite
and
request
your
honors
attention
to
the
language
of
the
prayer
for
preliminary
injunction
which
appears
826
of
the
record
because
there
the
plaintiff
sort
to
prohibit
the
individual
defendants
from
causing
bethlehem
to
purchase
or
pay
for
any
advertising
in
connection
with
any
federal

mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
believe
sir.
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
majority
opinion
is
indeed
not
only
to
approve
the
form
of
relief
but
in
actuality
to
sanction
injunctive
relief
as
a
preferred
remedy
contrasting
with
the
criminal
remedy
set
out
in
the
statute
itself.
and
this
thereby
in
our
contention
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
at
once
creating
an
entire
problem
of
prior
restraint
because
my
purpose
in
reading
this
language
to
the
court
is
to
show
that
there
was
in
actuality,
a
prior
restraint
not
only
of
the
particular
ad
but
indeed
of
ad
that
had
not
yet
been
prepared
or
published.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
your
honor.
damages
both
compensatory
and
punitive
were
sought
and
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
held
that
there
was
an
implied
rate
of
action
on
behalf
not
only
of
stockholders
but
also
on
behalf
of
all
voters
as
a
result
of
which
in
our
submission
there
is
an
unparalleled
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
in
this
case
going
far
beyond
anything
which
to
our
knowledge
has
ever
occurred
before.
most
particularly,
the
majority
paneled
below
concluded
that
it
was
not
bound
by
this
court's
decision
in
amtrak
but
turned
rather
to
borak
and
although
it
held
under
borak
that
the
implication
of
a
private
remedy
was
appropriate
to
use
chief
judge
seitz
words.
he
went
on
to
conclude
that
it
was
appropriate
for
a
variety
of
reasons
including
the
availability
of
a
more
expeditious
remedy,
including
the
possibility
of
some
sort
of
partisanship
on
the
part
of
governmental
authorities
charged
with
the
enforcement
of
the
act
and
also
because
it
was
appropriate
and
necessary
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
judge
aldisert
dissented
based
upon
this
court's
ruling
in
amtrak
saying
indeed
that
the
majority
had
defied
this
court's
ruling
in
amtrak.
the
trial
judge
who
was
reversed
by
the
majority
panel
had
concluded
on
the
basis
of
the
advertising
which
was
presented
to
him
that
there
was
not
an
implied
right
of
action.
that
610
had
to
be
narrowly
construed
in
order
to
avoid
a
constitutional
infringement
of
the
first
amendment
and
that
as
so
construed
the
expenditures
here
involved
did
not
come
within
active
electioneering
which
would
come
within
the
prohibition
of
the
act.
and
he
also
said
that
to
enjoin
the
expenditures
here
would
raise
the
gravest
constitutional
issues
under
the
first
amendment.
following
the
reversal,
there
was
--
following
the
grant
of
denial
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
third
circuit
which
affirmed
the
denial
of
the
preliminary
injunction.
thereafter,
there
was
an
application
for
security
for
expenses
below
as
the
result
of
which
the
state
pendent
jurisdiction
count
was
dropped
out
by
my
friends.
and
thereafter,
there
was
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
filed
before
judge
troutman,
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
implied
private
right
action
under
610.
that
610
is
inapplicable
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
610
is
unconstitutional.
there
was
a
motion
for
evidentiary
hearing
which
was
denied
because
judge
troutman
found
that
on
the
basis
of
the
language
of
the
act
on
the
basis
of
the
congressional
history
and
the
purpose
of
the
act.
there
was
no
implied
right
of
action
and
he
could
rule
that
as
a
matter
of
law
and
summary
judgment
was
then
granted
without
opinion.
i
would
urge
your
honors
to
examine
the
material
that
was
published
by
bethlehem
admittedly
which
is
attached
to
the
brief
and
in
the
record.
in
our
submission,
an
examination
of
that
material
was
showed
that
it
is
not
to
be
identified
with
any
anti-social
conduct.
this
kind
of
political
speech,
we
submit,
ought
not
to
be
characterized
as
a
crime.
it
cannot
be
said
to
come
from
a
corrupt
or
corrupting
source.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
our
urgent
submission
to
this
court,
it
comes
within
the
language
of
justice
reed
and
the
cio
case
if
the
earlier
provision
313
were
construed
to
prohibit
the
publication
by
corporations
in
the
regular
cause
of
conducting
their
affairs.
a
periodical's
advising
their
members,
stockholders,
and
customers
of
danger
or
advantage
to
their
interest
from
the
adoption
of
measures
or
the
election
to
offices
of
men
espousing
such
measures,
the
gravest
doubt
would
arise
in
our
minds
as
to
its
constitutionality.
in
our
contention
here,
the
advertising
the
material
that
is
before
the
court
represents
nonpartisans
sponsorship
of
issue
oriented
advertising,
contrary
to
the
viewed
taking
by
chief
judge
seitz
for
the
majority
below.
we
say
there
are
an
abundance
of
countervailing
reasons
why
this
court
should
not
conclude
that
the
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
is
necessary
here.
as
your
honors
are
aware,
the
government
has
far
than
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
it
has
not
contended
that
the
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
is
necessary.
its
here
simply
to
support
the
constitutionality
of
section
610,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
in
our
view
would
come
within
the
bond
suggested
by
the
nashville
milk
case
that
such
private
right
of
action
is
subjected
to
great
potential
abuse
because
here
we
have
as
the
result
of
the
opinion
by
the
third
circuit.
an
ability
on
the
part
of
the
all
of
the
voters
of
the
united
states,
all
of
the
stockholders
of
corporations
to
bring
actions
for
injunctive
relief
and
damages
and
what
this
would
mean
by
way
of
an
engulfment
of
the
court's
throughout
the
country
is
plain
to
be
seen
because
it
lends
itself
to
the
possibility
of
conflicting
judgments
coming
out
of
different
courts
on
the
same
ads,
a
multitude
of
litigation
coming
through
out
the
country,
ultimately
coming
to
this
court.
moreover,
it
is
admitted
in
this
case
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
con
--
the
congressional
history
of
the
litigation
which
shows
any
intention
on
the
part
of
the
congress
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action.
on
the
contrary
as
your
honors
are
aware,
this
is
legislation
which
has
for
over
50
years
evoked
the
continuing
repeated
concern
and
attention
of
the
congress.
it
has
been
as
your
honors
are
aware
recently
amended
not
only
in
71
but
also
in
74
and
then
our
view,
one
of
the
countervailing
reasons
that
militate
against
the
implication
of
a
private
remedy
is
the
fact
that
in
the
amendment
of
1974,
although
there
was
an
amendment
which
created
a
private
right
of
action
under
title
3
of
the
act,
there
was
no
change
by
the
congress
of
that
which
appears
in
title
2
of
the
act
and
this
comes
within
what
mr.
justice
stewart
wrote
in
amtrak
with
regard
to
the
application
of
exclusio
unius.
in
addition,
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
act
itself
which
speaks
or
hints
in
terms
of
the
implication
of
the
private
right
of
action
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
legislation
shows
a
carefully
devised
program
elaborated
by
the
congress
which
now
has
set
up
a
federal
election
commission
as
the
result
of
which
there
are
procedures
of
available
for
remedies
including
criminal
remedies
as
well
as
specific
civil
remedies.
under
mr.
justice
brennan's
reference
to
the
cross
light
in
the
pipefitters
case,
we
say
that
this
kind
of
cross
light
is
capable
of
being
brought
to
bear
upon
section
610
as
the
result
of
which
it
ought
not
to
be
held
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action.
in
addition,
normal
principles
of
statutory
construction,
we
suggest
dictate
the
denial
of
the
private
right
of
action
because
there
has
to
the
best
of
our
research
and
knowledge
your
honors,
never
had
been
a
situation
in
which
there
has
been
the
suggested
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
which
at
once
runs
counter
to
first
amendment
rights
of
the
defendants,
the
petitioners
here
and
carries
with
it
inevitably,
inescapably
the
possibility.
the
inevitability
of
prior
restraint
because
i
repeat,
chief
judge
seitz
for
the
majority
below
literarily
said
that
there
was
a
much
more
expeditious
remedy
to
be
found
particularly
in
the
form
of
injunctive
relief
by
the
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
and
how
that
could
occur
or
come
about
without
necessarily
at
ones
leading
to
a
prior
restraint
as
its
evidence
by
the
nature
of
the
language
of
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
that
was
originally
sort
here
is
something
that
really
belies
reality.
now
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
the
situation
that
the
rules
laid
down
by
this
court
particularly
in
areas
that
impinge
or
intrude
upon
first
amendment
rights
call
for
a
narrow
construction,
a
restrictive
construction
in
order
to
avoid
or
save
the
constitutional
issue.
but
on
the
contrary,
that
which
the
court
below
has
done
has
been
to
produce
the
most
expanded
kind
of
interpretation
of
expenditure.
your
honors
we'll
recall
that
the
rational
back
of
the
congressional
legislation
had
to
do
with
the
thought
of
undue
influence
emanating
from
aggressions
of
wealth
whether
by
corporations
or
unions,
and
a
desire
to
protect
the
minority
interest
within
corporations
or
labor
unions.
the
reality
of
it
is
that
the
expenditure
clause
in
610
as
interpreted
by
591
which
the
court
below
did
runs
in
the
face
of
that
kind
of
understanding
for
the
reason
that
the
interpretation
means
that
the
expenditure
of
one
dollar
even
though,
it
had
the
consent
unanimous
consent
of
the
stockholders
or
of
members
of
a
labor
union
would
nevertheless
come
within
the
band
of
the
statute.
moreover,
our
contention
is
that
the
ads
on
their
face,
the
ad,
the
speech,
the
folder
cannot
be
construed
as
representing
active
electioneering.
they
cannot
be
held
because
they
do
not
mention
the
name
of
a
single
candidate
nor
that
they
mention
the
name
of
a
political
party.
they
cannot
be
held
therefore
to
come
within
the
language
that
mr.
justice
frankfurter
used
in
the
uaw
case
as
something
that
was
intended
to
influence
the
public
at
large
to
vote
for
a
particular
candidate
or
a
particular
party.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
runs
both
ways
mr.
justice
white
for
the
reason
that
in
our
contention
their
ought
not
to
be
an
implication
of
a
private
right
of
action
when
constitutional
infringement
occurs
and
in
addition,
there
is
the
constitutional
argument
in
on
of
itself.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
610
and
591
both
come
into
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
oh!
no.
no,
sir
i
do
not
disagree.
on
the
contrary,
we
say
that
610
has
to
be
interpreted
and
defined
by
reason
of
591.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
we
say
that,
the
sections
were
never
intended
to
cover
this
kind
of
issue
oriented
non-partisan
advertising
or
communication
because
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
that's
right
sir.
if
there
is
no
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
which
is
what
has
been
done
before
a
narrowed
construction
of
expenditures,
so
as
to
avoid
running
counter
to
the
constitutional
principles
that
are
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
would
then
reach
the
conclusion
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
complaint
does
not
state
the
cause
of
action
on
its
face
because
it
does
not
then
come
within
the
band
of
expenditure
as
use
in
610
and
591.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
would
not
be
applicable
because
there
would
have
been
no
wrongdoing
committed
by
bethlehem
or
the
defendants.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
held
only
mr.
justice
white
that
there
was
a
disputed
issue
of
fact
as
the
result
of
which
the
grant
of
summary
judgment
was
reversed
and
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
a
trial
with
regard
to
that,
although
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
the
earlier
situation,
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
the
earlier
situation
was
one
in
which
the
trial
judge
himself
as
a
matter
of
law
had
concluded
that
there
was
not
a
partisanship
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
in
the
publications.
one
additional
point
that
also
emerges
in
this
factual
context
is
a
denial
by
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
because
610
is
applicable
only
to
corporations
and
labor
unions
and
obviously,
is
not
applicable
to
any
of
the
other
numerous
groups
that
are
as
much
capable
of
being
permitted.
and
have
the
same
rights
to
express
there
views
so
that
the
electorate
may
hear
their
views
because
that
is
where
also
the
first
amendment
right
goes
as
well
as
on
the
part
of
the
defendants,
the
petitioners
here,
to
express
their
views.
and
your
honors
will
recall
that
mr.
justice
douglas
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
uaw
speaks
in
terms
of
unions,
associations
of
manufacturers,
retail
and
wholesale
trade
groups,
consumer
leagues,
farmer's
unions,
religious
groups,
and
every
other
association
representing
a
segment
of
american
life
as
having
a
first
amendment
right
to
communicate
their
ideas
and
the
electorate
in
turn
having
a
right
to
hear
those
idea
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
it
was.
it
was
indeed
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
it
serves
to
point
up
the
fact
that
in
the
face
of
repeated
expressions
by
this
court
raising
red
flags
at
least
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
section
610.
the
court
below
instead
of
adopting
a
restricted
interpretation
of
expenditure
and
the
language
of
610
for
the
purpose
of
influencing
the
nomination
for
election
or
the
election
to
federal
office,
on
the
contrary,
took
a
very
expanded
view
so
that
there
is
no
expenditure
of
any
kind
that
could
possibly
come
without
the
bond
of
the
act
and
the
definition
given
by
the
majority
of
the
court
below.
our
view
is,
that
in
actuality
there
is
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
because
beyond
mere
problems
of
corporate
aggregations
of
wealth.
as
your
honors,
i
believe
our
well
aware,
there
are
some
50
entities
that
are
not
corporations
which
are
traded
to
on
the
new
york's
stock
exchange
and
there
are
all
these
other
entities
that
are
equally
involved
in
the
robust
vigorous
discussion
that
your
honors
have
said
was
necessary
in
order
to
protect
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
is
not
then
reached
your
honor.
if
there
is
no
implied
right
of
action
here
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
it
ends
this
lawsuit.
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
except
your
honor,
may
i
bring
to
your
attention
in
that
regard,
the
fact
that
the
amendment
to
the
feca
of
1974
has
created
the
federal
election
commission
which
is
intending
to
get
under
way.
we
had
a
presidential
election
coming
up
and
this
comes
within
the
language
of
your
honor's
decision
in
the
cox
broadcasting
case.
there
are
enormously
important
first
amendment
rights
which
invite
your
honor's
determination
now,
rather
than
the
fact
which
has
been
the
case
that
for
18
years
there
has
been
a
miasmic
cloud
over
this
entire
subject
as
the
result
of
which.
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
conclude
other
than
that
there
is
an
extremely
chilling
effect
on
the
right
of
free
speech
not
only
of
corporation
but
all
other
entities
as
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
there
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
this
law
your
honor
--
the
--
as
amended
by
1974
made
up
of
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
has
the
ability
to
bring
civil
action
and
there
is
also
the
continuing
criminal
remedy
available.
the
commission
is
made
up
of
six
members,
the
clerk
of
the
senate,
the
secretary
of
the
senate,
the
clerk
of
the
house,
and
then
four
others.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
would
think
your
honor
that
there
is
bound
to
be
because
this
case
in
itself
repre
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
it
--
it
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
but
that
comes
within
title
3
of
the
act,
section
610
comes
within
title
2
of
the
act,
sir.
and
this
is
why
we
say
that,
the
cross-like
to
be
brought
to
bear
here
indicates
that
congress
quite
knowingly
never
intended
that
there
be
the
implied
private
right
of
action
because
this
is
not
the
kind
of
statute
that
is
just
one's
treated
by
the
congress.
on
the
contrary,
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
indeed,
your
honor
and
this
is
one
reason
why
since
the
matter
is
here
and
certiorari
has
been
granted
that
covers
because
we
did
indeed
raise
the
constitutional
question.
we
hope
and
request
that
your
honors
would
give
consideration
to
the
constitutional
issue
because
it
has
ongoing
enormous
impact
and
inevitably
there
will
be
other
cases
that
will
follow
or
attempt
to
follow
the
president
of
the
third
circuit.
with
your
honors'
permission
unless
there
are
other
questions,
i
would
reserved
my
time
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
think
that
there
was
an
intent
by
congress
to
create
an
administrative
commission
that
would
bring
uniformity
and
a
growing
body
of
expertise
to
this
problem.
and
thereby
not
intending
to
create
a
private
right
of
action
which
would
lead
to
a
variety
or
diverse
inevitably
conflicting
opinions
because
every
district
court
in
the
country
would
be
engulfed
by
the
possibility
that
every
voter
within
that
district
as
well
as
every
shareholder
of
any
corporation
within
that
district
would
be
able
to
go
into
court
and
would
not
be
barred
by
the
fact
that
somebody
else
is
going
in
on
that
same
ad
or
material
that
is
substantially
identical
to
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
oh!
i
would
hope
that
your
honor
would
give
consideration
to
all
the
issues
that
we
have
right
--
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
i
want
desperately
to
win
your
honor.
[laughter]
unless
there
other
questions
sir,
i
would
reserve
my
time.
mr.
edwin
p.
rome
with
your
honors'
permission,
i
would
bring
to
your
attention
the
fact
that
judge
aldisert
had
earlier
commented
in
the
same
way
that
mr.
justice
stewart
has
suggested
to
imply
a
private
right
of
action
here
he
says,
is
to
suggest
that
for
every
written
volume
of
title
18
united
states
code.
there
is
an
unwritten
volume
of
title
28.
in
actuality,
contrary
to
what
mr.
berger
has
said,
the
congressional
history
of
this
legislation
shows
that
the
chairman
of
the
house
conferees,
mr.
hay
and
this
appears
on
page
32
and
33
of
our
brief,
pointed
out
that
there
was
an
intention
to
assure
that
civil
suits
are
not
misuse
in
a
partisan
manner
and
that
the
complex
and
sensitive
rights
and
duties
stated
in
the
act
are
administered
expertly
and
uniformly.
and
therefore,
the
private
civil
action
was
created
via
the
commission
under
title
3
but
not
in
title
2.
in
actuality
also,
i
urge
upon
your
honors
the
recognition
that
what
has
been
the
heart
of
this
case
from
the
beginning
has
been,
the
speech,
the
ad,
and
the
folder
and
that
alone.
there
has
been
no
doubt
or
dispute
about
that
even
to
the
point
that
my
friends
on
the
other
side
sought
to
have
the
third
circuit
rule
as
a
matter
of
law
on
summary
judgment
that
those
documents
in
and
of
themselves
constituted
a
violation.
they
weren't
seeking
to
bring
in
any
other
plan
or
any
other
activity
on
the
part
of
the
defendants.
i
would
also
point
out
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
discovery
sought
here.
i
think
that
that
is
a
blatant
intrusion
into
first
amendment
areas
because
you
would
--
under
those
circumstances
the
inquiring
of
the
defe
--
individual
defendants
here
about
their
political
ideas,
their
views,
their
party
membership
which
in
our
submission
is
absolutely
impermissible
under
the
first
amendment.
and
in
actuality,
it
is
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
avoided
coming
to
the
constitutional
issue
only
because
he
said,
“that
there
was
a
mandate
to
narrowly
restrict
the
interpretation
and
the
definition
of
the
expenditure
so
as
to
avoid
that
result.
to
enjoin
the
expenditures
made
by
bethlehem
in
connection
with
the
advertisement,
the
speech,
and
the
folder
would
prevent
a
corporation
from
seeking
an
honest
campaign
in
election
which
is
adverse
to
its
interest.
thereby
giving
rise
to
grave
first
amendment
issues.
that
is
what
happened
in
the
district
court
and
also
the
court
of
appeals
touched
upon
the
constitutional
issue
that
and
that
appears
at
page
108
of
the
record.
thank
you
very
much,
sirs.
