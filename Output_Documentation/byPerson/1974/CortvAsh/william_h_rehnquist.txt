justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rome,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
in
its
opinion
necessarily
approve
that
form
of
relief,
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
the
respondent
seek
damages
also?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
you
wouldn't
have
to
decide
whether
there
was
a
private
right
of
action
either
if
your
narrow
construction
there's
term
expenditures
is
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
criminal
sanctions
wouldn't
be
applicable
on
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
aren't
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
isn't
to
really
create
common
law,
the
way
the
state
courts
says?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
referred
to
it
just
like
the
common
law.
it
isn't
just
like
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
the
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
rob
a
federally
insured
bank.
do
you
think
that
bank
has
a
civil
action
in
the
district
court
under
federal
question
jurisdiction
to
recover
the
money
that
was
taken?
