justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
argument
here,
your
making
a
constitutional
argument
now
or
your
making
a
statutory
construction
on
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
but
if
the
statute
plainly
covers
these
kinds
of
expenditures
then
you
would
reached
your
constitutional
argument,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
but
--
now,
how
about
--did
do
--
does
involve
here
in
section
591
i
gather
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
disagree
--
you
don't
disagree
that
591
standards
are
relevant
to
610?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
you're
saying
that
these
expenditures
are
plainly
covered
by
either
section?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
not?
i
gather
if
you're
correct
in
that,
then
the
constitutional
argument
you
make
need
not
be
--
they
disappear?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
using
the
constitutional
arguments
as
a
reason
for
giving
in
the
construction
this
expenditure
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
courts
of
the
court
of
appeals
just
to
claim
disagreed
with
you
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
particular
expenditures
were
partisan?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
see.
so,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
moment
mr.
rome.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
your
view
of
the
scope
of
expenditures
but
agree
that
there
was
no
implied
right
of
action.
what
happens
to
the
constitutional
question
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
ends
this
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
the
constitutional
idea
to
some
criminal
prosecutions
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
law
as
the
--
there
is
administrative
agency
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
possibility
for
enforcing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
--
this
have
cease
and
desist
power,
they
didn't
have
to
go
court
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
under
the
new
law
there
would
be
an
argument
about
there
being
obliged,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
nothing
in
the
new
statute
that
says,
whatever
this
agency
may
do
that
it
what
may
do
is
exclusive.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
if
congress
has
it
oppose
the
--
i
don't
remember
that
this
--
agency
which
has
civil
remedies
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
your
–
it's
certain
if
you,
if
you
think
you
have
strong
argument
under
the
old
statute,
it
certainly
has
gone
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
if
you
petition
for
a
--
you've
raised
questions
here
besides
the
constitution
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
want
to
subside
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
counter-elect
on
to
win
as
long
as
you
live?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
we
disagree
with
the
other
side
on
--
in
private
action
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
yes.
but
to
solicit
the
--
i
gather
this
third
circuit
held
that
if
you
prove
what
you
claim,
you
can
prove
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
610
may
prevent
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
they
said
that
that's
constitutional
for
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
the
reason
--
justice
byron
r.
white
because
they'll
be
able
--
they
said
it's
not
unconstitutional
on
its
face?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
it?
how,
how
about
the
question
of
just
overbreadth
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you're
right
about
all
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
sometime
the
constitutional
question
has
got
to
be
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
that
they
were
right
as
far
as
they
went.
at
least,
shouldn't
we
sent
it
back
and
say,
“now,
you
address
the
constitutional
questions?”
justice
byron
r.
white
before
you
go
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
isn't
there
a
facial
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
had
recovered
any
recovery
from
these
people
in
the
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
go
into
your
state
courts
and
say
these
people
have
violated
the
federal
statute
in
giving
away
this
money?
and
that
we
want
to
recover
it
from
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
an
exp
--
i
didn't
mention
my
question
to
you.
my
question
to
you,
you're
an
experienced
--
justice
byron
r.
white
pennsylvanian
lawyer
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wondered
if
you
would
want
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that's
an
ultra
vires?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
dependent
at
all
on
the
application
of
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
does,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
there
is
a
remedy
in
the
state
courts
under
the
state
law
to
vindicate
his
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
not
only
possible
but
you
just
said
that
its
there.
you
