mr.
leo
pfeffer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
a
challenge
to
three
statutes
enacted
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
1972.
this
court
in
1971,
in
the
case
of
lemon
against
kurtzman
had
previously
declared
unconstitutional
a
statute
providing
for
the
purchase
of
secular
services
by
nonpublic
schools
and
the
court
held
at
that
violated
the
establishment
clause.
thereafter,
the
district
court
in
the
east
district
of
pennsylvania
held
unconstitutional
another
statute
and
which
provided
for
reimbursement
for
tuition
paid
by
parents
for
their
children
attending
nonpublic
schools.
now,
it
declared
unconstitutional
as
the
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
and
while
that
case
was
pending
before
this
court
in
appeal
to
this
court,
the
pennsylvania
legislature
acted
a
package
of
three
statutes,
acts
194,
195
and
204.
now,
act
204
can
be
told
very
briefly.
it
increased
the
amount
which
had
originally
been
appropriated
for
the
tuition
grants
payment
although
the
law
had
already
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
this
district
court.
however,
that
case
is
now
moot,
that
part
of
our
complaint
is
now
moot
because
this
court
affirmed
the
district
court,
so
that
part
of
the
complaint
which
we
alleged
is
now
moot.
but
before
this
court
is
the
constitutionality
of
acts
194
and
195.
briefly,
act
194
provides
for
financing
our
tax
rates
funds
are
what
are
called
auxiliary
services
in
nonpublic
schools.
i
don't
want
to
spend
time
reading
the
definition
that
is
contained
in
the
--
jurisdictions
contained
the
appendix
contained
on
page
four
of
our
brief.
act
195
has
three
separate
provisions,
all
providing
for
tax
support
of
services
in
nonpublic
schools.
one
provision
provide
for
textbooks,
another
for
instructional
materials
and
the
third
for
instructional
equipment.
the
definitions
of
each
are
in
our
brief.
now,
the
amounts
appropriated
in
1972
was
$31
million
and
then
the
following
year
it
was
increased
to
$35
million
per
year,
which
it
is
now
subject
to
further
increases
which
we
may
assume
will
take
place.
the
district
court,
in
a
vote
of
two
to
one
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
auxiliary
services
provision.
unanimously,
although
judge
higginbotham
was
quite
reluctant,
obviously
reluctant
to
go
along,
but
he
did,
for
reasons
which
i
frankly
i'm
not
able
to
understand,
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
textbook
provision.
on
the
instructional
materials
again
we
had
a
two
to
one
split
with
judge
higginbotham
dissenting.
in
the
instructional
equipment
we
have
a
sort
of
a
compromise.
part
of
the
statute
was
declared
unconstitutional
unanimously,
and
part
of
it
was
declared
constitutional
in
respect
to
and
this
court
read
this
into
the
statute
to
such
instructional
equipment
which
from
its
nature
cannot
be
readily
diverted
to
religious
purposes
and
is
particularly
designed
or
designated
for
secular
educational
purposes
preferred
for
under
statute
and
is
duly
promulgated
guides
for
the
administration
of
such
statute.
now,
as
far
as
the
appellants
are
concerned
there
are
no
contested
fact
situation
in
this
case.
we
believe
the
statute
on
the
basis
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
we
would
like
to
put
this
case
in
proper
perspective.
we
do
not
challenge
the
right
of
pupils
in
nonpublic
schools
to
obtain
these
services,
all
of
them.
we
challenge
the
right
to
obtain
these
services
as
part
of
the
overall
program
of
religious
education
in
religious
school.
now
we
concede,
we
recognize
that
it
is
more
convenient
to
bring
the
service
to
the
children
than
to
have
the
children
come
to
the
public
schools.
we
are
not
talking
about,
requiring
children
to
enroll
in
public
schools
a
complete
program,
but
to
come
to
the
public
schools
for
these
additional
services
benefits.
i
will
recognize
that
it
is
more
convenient
the
other
way.
but
their
contention
that
the
values
protected
by
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment
which
is
caught
spelled
out
and
emphasized
again
in
wisconsin
against
yoder,
and
again
in
the
nyquist
case
last
year
that
these
values
are
so
dominant
in
our
democratic
concept
in
hierarchy
of
values
that
the
inevitable
somewhat
were
inconvenient
method
of
delivering
these
services
requiring
the
children
to
come
to
the
religious
schools
that
they
do
in
release
time
practices
which
this
court
upheld
in
1952.
now
that
is
undoubtedly
less
convenient
in
other
way,
but
the
highest
state
which
both
the
free
exercise
and
the
establishment
clauses
as
the
court
pointed
out
which
is
held
in
our
heart
of
values
requires
this
somewhat
modest
sacrifice.
now,
there's
another
fact
which
we
deem
of
vital
importance
and
we
deem
maybe
the
heart
of
the
case.
now
this
case
does
not
come
to
this
court
as
tabula
rasa
which
faces
the
nature
of
the
educational
system
at
pennsylvania
and
the
relationship
of
the
nonpublic
--
public
schools
and
the
religious
schools,
among
the
nonpublic
schools
with
before
this
court
in
lemon
against
kurtzman
and
then
again
in
the
sloan
against
lemon.
it
is
uncontested,
this
was
uncontested
that
in
administering
the
law,
we
have
the
appendix
citation
page
a47
or
48
the
commissioner
of
who
is
--
had
the
obligation
and
force
will
agree
that
in
administering
the
law
there
are
certain
eligibility
requirements,
requiring
the
curriculum
of
the
school
and
so
on.
but
not
included
in
these
eligibility
requirements
and
not
deemed
to
be
disabling
is
the
fact
for
example
that
the
schools
restrict
admissions
on
the
basis
of
religion
or
that
the
schools
require
all
students
to
participate
in
religious
instruction
as
condition
for
their
continuance
in
the
school,
or
that
the
schools
serve
a
major
religious
purpose
in
their
functions.
now,
the
state
of
pennsylvania
takes
a
position
that
these
are
not
the
stabling
factors,
that
notwithstanding
these
facts,
the
schools
and
the
students
attending
those
schools
are
entitled
to
the
food
benefits
of
the
act.
now,
there's
one
constitutional
provision
as
one
which
to
me
is
as
close
to
a
categorical
imperative
in
constitutional
as
we
can
get
to.
i
submit
that
whether
you
look
at
it
from
the
first
amendment,
the
fifth,
the
ninth
or
the
fourteenth,
it
is
simply
not
within
the
concept
of
our
constitutional
concepts
of
our
constitutional
dictations
that
a
service
which
is
financed
with
funds
raised
through
compulsory
taxation
of
all
citizens
from
such
service
and
these
citizens
can
be
bared
because
of
his
religion
and
because
of
his
race.
this
is
as
close
to
a
categorical
imperative,
i
can
see,
and
only
second
to
that
is
that
such
a
school
can
condition
participation
in
the
benefits
universally
financed
upon
the
students
participating
in
religious
services
or
religious
sectarian
instructions.
this
is
if
your
honors
please
to
me
the
heart
of
this
case,
and
as
i
say
it
is
close
as
i
can
see
to
it
categorical
imperative.
the
court
pointed
that
out
in
norwood
against
harrison
in
which
it
held
that
textbooks
to
one
of
the
provisions
of
our
law
and
one
as
act
195
could
not
be
appropriate,
could
not
be
sent
to
private
schools
which
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
race.
and
in
norwood
against
harrison,
the
court
pointed
out
to
the
dissenting
or
partly
dissenting
partly
concurrent
opinion
of
mr.
justice
white
in
the
lemon
against
kurtzman
case
that
if
a
school
discriminates
or
restricts
admissions
either
on
race
or
religion
or
requires
participation
of
sectarian
instruction
students
that
the
services
such
as
textbooks
or
other
services,
and
the
norwood
case
dealt
with
textbooks,
could
not
be
made
available
in
that
school.
so
that
it
is
our
opinion,
it
is
our
view
that
on
the
basis
of
that
alone,
of
that
principle,
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute
cannot
be
held
as
interpreted
in
the
previous
cases
of
lemon
v.
kurtzman
and
sloan
against
lemon.
now,
between
the
time
that
the
district
court
handed
down
its
decision
in
our
case
and
the
time,
the
present
time
this
court
affirmed
petition
of
a
district
court
from
the
third
circuit
in
new
jersey
in
the
case
of
marburger
against
public
funds
for
public
schools,
and
the
supreme
court
has
since
then
affirmed
per
curiam
that
decision.
now,
the
statute
in
that
case,
in
the
marburger
case,
as
far
as
i
can
read
is
there
are
some
differences
in
detail,
which
i
believe
are
secondary
as
far
as
the
constitutional
issue
is
concerned
presented
in
this
case.
i
do
not
recognize,
i
do
not
see
any
significant
constitutional
difference
between
the
statute
and
in
new
jersey
and
the
statute
of
pennsylvania,
they
came
of
the
same
pattern
and
the
language
is
in
the
most
of
the
statute,
the
language
is
identical,
the
words
are
identical,
the
setup
is
identical.
they
freely
throw
off
practical
purposes
as
far
as
they
are
identical
statutes
and
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
everything
which
is
in
the
statute
is
involved
in
marburger
and
textbooks
too.
they
were
somewhat
slightly
different
in
the
way
the
textbooks
was
provided
for,
but
i
don't
believe
it's
constitutionally
significant.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
the
basic
difference
was
in
the
margburger
case
that
the
course
and
money
for
the
textbook
was
given
instead
of
the
textbooks
themselves.
here
the
textbooks
alone,
but
basically
the
same.
they
still
came
out
of
the
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
the
money
to
reimburse
the
cost
of
textbooks.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
that
was
similar
to
this.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
similar
to
this.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
similar.
well,
i
almost
think
identical,
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
it's
almost
the
word
for
it
is
identical.
they
obviously
came
out
the
same
pattern,
the
same
mold.
i
don't
think
there's
--
i
don't
think
there's
any
basic
difference
at
all.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
yes
i
will
do
that
right
now.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes,
well
now
--
but
i
say
that
i
will
do
that
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
note
that
in
marburger
it
was
not.
the
district
court
and
this
court's
affirmance
held
the
entire
statute
unconstitutional.
now,
but
for
the
convenience
purposes
and
i
also
submit
that
these
statutes
were
enacted
as
a
package
with
the
clear
intent
or
purpose
of
recouping
the
money
which
had
been
denied
by
this
court
in
the
other
decisions.
now,
let
us
take
the
auxiliary
services
provision
first.
first
i
suggest
that
as
far
as
i
read
the
first
amendment,
there
is
no
constitutional
distinction
between
educational
services
are
called
auxiliary
or
non-auxiliary.
auxiliary
service
is
a
new
term
and
it
didn't
exist
previously
until
just
very,
very
recently.
but
making
--
calling
the
auxiliary
services
--
calling
the
educational
services
auxiliary
services
still,
they're
still
educational
services.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
don't
think
mr.
chief
justice
because
the
regulations
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
not
all.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
but
the
bulk
--
the
bulk
you
do
have,
because
if
the
regulations
which
have
been
adopted
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania
which
i'm
--
my
footnote
3
on
page
15
of
my
brief
indicates
that
services,
auxiliary
services,
are
defined
to
include
those
service
necessary
to
assist
a
student
to
perform
at
the
grade
level
of
his
age
and
potential.
what
does
that
mean?
that
means
that
if
a
pupil
is
below
the
grade
level,
you
have
to
help
him
get
to
the
grade
level.
how
do
you
do
it?
you
give
them
a
more
intensive
education
after
hours
or
more
intensive
or
what's
often
done,
smaller
class
with
more
teachers.
but
it's
simply
education
service
is
the
same
type
was
involved
in
lemon
against
kurtzman,
lemon
against
sloan,
the
nyquist,
and
every
case
that
has
come
to
this
case
--
to
this
court.
there's
no
school
in
the
continent
which
doesn't
have
students
who
are
below
grade
level
or
except
in
utopia
perhaps
or
school
of
limited
to
geniuses.
and
it's
a
job
of
a
teacher
to
take
additional
time
to
--
with
a
pupil
below
grade
level
in
some
case
will
be
above
grade
level
and
will
not
additional
help
and
to
take
time
with
them.
and
all
that
existed
in
1787
as
it
does
today
in
every
school,
but
according
to
the
--.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
but
your
honor,
this
court
has
held
way
back
as
far
as
campbell
against
connecticut.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
there
was
no
fourteenth
amendment
in
1787.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
there
was
no
fourteenth
amendment
and
there
were
no
--
they
were
practically
no
public
schools
either.
but
the
principals
laid
down
in
1787
are
certainly
broad
enough
to
encompass
everything
that
this
court
has
done
in
interpreting
the
first
amendment
as
applicable
to
our
educational
system.
now,
it
is
our
contention
that
considered
within
the
framework
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
1971,
lemon
against
kurtzman,
early
against
atenzio,
and
in
1973
levitt
versus
first
committee
for
public
education
and
committee
for
public
education
against
nyquist
that
this
auxiliary
service
provision
cannot
stand.
what
this
basically
does
is
to
make
a
partnership
of
church
and
state.
it
involves
that
entanglement
of
church
and
state
which
this
court
beginning
with
the
walz
case
held
was
forbidden
by
the
establishment
clause.
it
requires
the
state
to
take
part
of
the
educational
burden
in
the
schools,
the
church
and
the
other
part,
they
worked
together.
the
teachers
come
in
and
they
go
out,
the
substitution
supervision.
it
is
an
administrative
entanglement.
it
is
an
entanglement
in
the
sense
which
the
court
know
these
cases
as
emphasized
in
order
to
assure
that
the
establishment
clause
is
not
violated
by
the
use
of
instruction
to
propagate
religious
values.
there
must
be
surveillance.
and
the
court
said,
it
said
as
far
back
as
lemon
against
kurtzman
repeated
in
nyquist
and
lemon
against
sloan
that
we
do
not
have
to
find
that
in
any
particular
school,
there
was
no
fact,
there
was
no
trial
or
fact,
the
other
two
pennsylvania
cases
as
the
two
lemon
cases.
we
do
not
have
to
find
that
this
teacher
or
that
teacher
did
actually
use
her
or
his
position
to
advance
religious
values.
the
constitutional
clause
requires
a
state
to
take
all
measures
to
prevent
that
friction
that
possibility,
that
temptation
and
we
submit
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
has
not
done
that.
the
state
of
pennsylvania
as
indicated
on
the
hearing,
takes
a
position
that
you
can
trust
the
teacher.
well,
i
have
no
suspicion
of
any
particular
teachers,
but
that's
not
what
the
amendment
requires
as
far
as
this
court
is
concerned.
the
amendment
requires
that
there
be
no
opportunity,
there
be
no
temptation
there
be
no
conflict,
possibility
of
conflict
or
misunderstanding.
and
the
only
way,
that's
why
the
court
in
every
case
since
allen
in
1968
in
every
case
which
reached
this
court
involving
(a)
to
religious
clause
are
the
elementary
and
secondary
level,
i'm
not
talking
about
the
cause
though,
an
elementary
and
secondary
level.
no
matter
what
the
pattern,
whether
it's
tuition
grants
or
secular
purchases,
or
secular
services,
or
supplementary
salaries
to
teachers,
or
tax
credits,
or
tax
benefits,
or
maintenance,
or
repair
everyone
is
in
a
pattern.
the
court
said
that
you
are
faced
with
this
insoluble
dilemma.
either
the
benefit
is
used
for
religious
purposes
to
advance
religion
which
is
forbidden,
or
to
prevent
that.
the
school
is
subject
to
that
surveillance,
which
itself
violates
the
establishment
clause
because
it
entails
excessive
entanglement.
now
so
much
for
auxiliary
service,
i
will
go
to
the
textbooks.
now
the
keystone
are
the
textbook
provision
on
which
the
court
below
although
not
the
court
in
marburger,
the
court
below
upheld
the
textbook
provision
unanimously
was
the
board
of
education
against
allen
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
i
ask
that
this
court
overrule
allen
but
i
point
out
my
brief.
it
can
reach
the
same
decision
without
overruling.
as
my
position
--
it
is
our
position
that
allen
was
not
consistent
with
what
this
court
had
said
before
it,
and
certainly
not
consistent
with
what
this
court
has
held
after.
it
stands
alone
by
itself.
that
the
premises
upon
which
is
based
have
been
shaken
by
every
case
on
which
the
issue
was
raised
including
the
norwood
case,
which
while
it
involved
racial
discrimination,
basically
is
indistinguishable
and
as
far
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
concerned.
discrimination
on
religion
is
certainly
no
more
preferable
than
could've
determined
in
race
in
respect
to
institutions.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
as
interpreted
by
this
court
by
all
means.
this
court
as
i
said
in
norwood
against
harrison,
the
court
pointed
out
that
even
as
to
justice
white
in
his
dissent
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
no,
norwood
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
case,
but
the
court
noted,
mr.
justice
white's
opinion
in
the
first
amendment
cases
that
the
first
amendment
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
it
doesn't
matter
which,
i
mean
its
the
first,
fifth
or
fourteenth
or
all
of
them
combined
forbids
the
use
of
public
funds
to
provide
services
from
which
persons
are
excluded
or
put
in
a
lower
category
than
this
is.
either
because
of
the
risk
or
religion
both
of
them
are
stated
and
both
are
stated
in
norwood
against
harrison.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
answer
is
not
hostility
that
is
unfortunate
--
an
unfortunate
term
because
the
court,
this
court
has
had
the
task,
ever
since
it
started
with
the
first
case
and
which
it
declared
unconstitutionally
state
statute
involving
a
state
tax
involving
release
time
at
the
public
schools.
each
time
the
court
just
found
necessary
to
repeat
that
the
barriers
of
the
first
amendment
were
not
motivated
by
any
hostility
to
religion
nor
religion
to
education.
but
i
believe
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
it's
motivated
by
that
because
it
involves
state
involvement
not
by
private
education
or
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
prevent
a
private
school
from
segregating
by
race.
now,
why
does
it
involve,
why
does
a
fourteenth
amendment
indicate
hostility,
because
if
there
is
the
state
involvement
and
that
type
of
discrimination
which
the
constitution
is
hostile
to
and
its
position
that
certainly
no
hostility
to
religious
education
anymore
than
as
hostility
to
racial
segregated
as
far
as
constitution
is
concerned.
the
constitution
is
hostile
to
is
state
or
governmental
involvement
in
discrimination
among
its
own
people
on
the
base
of
their
religion,
that
is
the
basis
of
the
status
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
it's
irrelevant.
it's
irrelevant
whether
the
discrimination
be
based
upon
religion
or
based
upon
race,
it
just
enough
permissible
discrimination
as
far
as
government
is
concerned.
now,
we
urge,
i
say
we
urge
that
allen
be
reconsidered,
but
it's
not
necessary
if
the
court
is
not
prepared
to
reconsider
allen.
we
believe
that
allen
is
completely
distinguishable
and
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
this
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
on
textbooks?
how
well,
in
first
place
the
element
of
discrimination
which
does
not
appear
in
allen
which
does
appear
here.
the
element
of
the
fact
that
there
is
discrimination
in
admissions
and
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
agrees
that
you
can
give
textbooks
for
use
in
the
schools
which
will
involve
people
because
of
their
religion
that
was
not
in
allen.
secondly,
there
are
entanglement
elements
in
this
statute
and
the
regulations
which
depict
a
substantial
degree
of
entanglement.
allen
was
decided
before
walz,
and
the
entanglement
part
of
the
three-fold
tests
which
started
with
schempp
that
was
not
before
the
court,
but
it
is
now
before
the
court.
and
on
page
24
and
25
of
our
brief
we
have
seven
--
eight
ways
in
which
there
we
submit
there
is
an
entanglement
and
violated
the
walz
and
its
progeny.
eight
elements
of
entanglement
it
did
not
exist
were
not
before
the
court
in
allen.
now
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes?
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well
the
discrimination
is
in
respect
to
the
textbook
in
walz.
if
a
student
wants
to,
a
pupil
wants
to
avail
himself
of
a
textbook
which
is
supplied,
maybe
a
very
good
textbook,
it's
supplied
throughout
the
schools
and
they're
not
to
be
the
same
textbooks
which
are
used
in
public
school.
they
have
to
be
textbooks
which
are
accepted
by
public
schools
but
not
used.
now,
if
a
student
wants
to
avail
himself
of
that
type
of
textbook,
he
can
only
do
so
by
becoming
a
student
of
that
private
school
and
he
cannot
do
it
if
he
is
not
of
the
right
religion.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
he
can't
get
the
benefit
of
that
textbook.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
yes.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
the
answers
is
the
discriminations
is
this
that
it
is
certain
within
the
discretion
of
the
school
board
to
say
“we
will
use
text
a
rather
than
b
and
the
student
who
like
to
use
text
b
rather
than
text
a
has
no
constitutional
agreement”
unless,
unless
the
only
reason
he
is
barred
from
using
textbook
b
is
because
of
his
race
of
his
color.
that's
what
norwood
against
harrison
held.
he
is
not
--
there's
no
question
that
schools
have
power
to
determine
which
textbooks
can
be
used,
but
it's
our
contention,
they
cannot
exercise
that
power
on
the
basis
of
the
religion
of
the
students,
and
the
requirement
that
the
students
participate
in
religious
instructions
to
get
access
for
that
textbooks.
that
is
the
constitutional
wall
between
them.
now,
so
much
for
the
textbooks.
now
on
instructional
materials,
again
it
is
our
contention
that
the
instruction
materials
in
order
to
make
sure
that
this
is
not
used
for
religious
purposes,
there
must
be
that
surveillance
where
this
first
amendment
forbids.
and
the
interesting
effect
is
that
you
cannot
rely
upon
the
constitutional
permits
reliability
upon
the
good
faith
of
the
teachers.
that's
what
this
court
held
time
and
time
again.
the
interesting
part
about
this
is
that
the
district
court
itself
that
the
district
court
itself
recognized
that
merely
reliance
upon
the
good
faith
of
the
teachers
is
not
enough,
because
in
respect
to
instructionally
equipment,
they
tried
to
make
a
distinction
between
instructional
--
was
it
readily
usable
for
religious
purposes
and
one
which
is
not
readily
usable
for
the
religious
purposes.
now,
if
you
rely,
if
the
constitution
permits
reliance
on
the
good
faith
of
the
teachers,
then
this
distinction
is
meaningless
and
the
appellants
in
this
case
have
not
appealed
from
that
part
of
the
court's
decision.
why
do
we
rely
on
the
teacher's
good
faith
and
in
auxiliary
services
that
as
the
state
of
pennsylvania
asked
us
to
do?
why
are
we
asked
to
rely
upon
the
good
faith
of
the
teacher
in
respect
to
auxiliary
services
when
the
district
court
agreed
you
cannot
rely
upon
their
good
faith
in
respect
to
instructional
equipment,
and
therefore
bars
the
use
of
instructional
equipment.
we
--
it
is
our
--
the
instructional
equipment
which
is
allegedly
not
readably
usable
for
religious
purposes,
it
is
our
contention
that
is
a
very
all
official
distinction
and
that
with
any
degree
of
revolves
from
this
packing
anything
can
be
use
for
religious
purposes.
we've
given
examples
in
our
brief
and
in
the
decision
before
this
court,
previous
decisions,
the
court
for
example
in
the
levitt
case
--
no
in
the
part
one
of
nyquist,
which
held
unconstitutional
a
law
providing
funds
for
the
maintenance
repair,
a
pro
rata
of
school
equipment
and
school
planning.
and
the
court
said
“if
the
building
is
heated
there's
no
way
of
shutting
off
the
heat
from
the
classroom
in
which
religion
is
taught,
or
the
light.”
you
simply
--
the
education
system
is
such
that
such
a
differentiation
is
all
official
and
impossible.
all
you
can
only
assure
compliance
with
the
establishment
clause
by
that
surveillance,
which
as
i've
indicated
before,
is
forbidden
by
the
entanglement
aspect
of
the
first
amendment.
as
the
court
earlier
said
there
is
a
scylla
and
charybdis
here
which
is
simply
unmanageable.
the
court
has
said,
an
in
all
these
cases
which
are
referred
to
that
they've
gone
--
allowed
textbooks,
allowed
bus
transportation
in
everson
in
1947
and
even
then,
the
court
said
“this
verges
upon
the
unconstitutional.”
they
allow
it
over
the
strong
center
for
the
justices
and
the
justice
who
wrote
the
opinion
mr.
justice
black
has
never
gone
beyond
that.
and
finally,
in
1968
the
allen
case
and
said,
“okay,
this
verge
is
beyond.”
the
want
that
step,
but
it
in
the
cases
which
i've
cited
and
each
of
those
cases,
and
particularly
the
nyquist
case
and
the
sloan
case,
alleged
the
court
this
said
“we're
not
going
to
even
approach
that
verge.
we're
not
going
to
do
anymore.”
because
the
verge
itself
is
a
difficult
line
to
draw
and
the
values
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
are
so
high
that
we
cannot
tamper.
we
cannot
tamper
or
risk
the
violations
of
those
values
or
the
--
by
these
such
statutory
provisions.
in
the
yoder
case,
which
i
believe
my
brother
mr.
ball
argued
before
this
court,
the
court
said
that
while
a
secondary
education
is
of
high
value
and
the
state
has
an
interest
in
seeing
towards
that
all
its
citizens
obtain,
the
secretary
as
well
as
primary
education.
it
is
not
high
enough,
it
does
not
high
enough
to
outweigh
the
values
of
the
religion
clause
and
in
the
yoder
case
appoint
said
“use
both
the
religion
and
establishment
clause
--“
mr.
leo
pfeffer
oh
yes,
i'm
sorry
i
was
supposed
to
--
mr.
leo
pfeffer
well,
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
--
the
signal
just
--
thank
you
your
honor.
i
don't
know
how
much
we
have
left
that
would
be
for
my
colleague
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
leo
pfeffer
for
rebuttal,
yes.
