do
you
think
that
the
first
amendment
mandates
the
same
sort
of
state
hostility
towards
religious
education
as
the
fourteenth
amendment
mandates
towards
segregated,
as
education
segregated
by
race?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
i'm
asking
you
is,
conceding
that,
isn't
the
barrier
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
fact
motivated
by
hostility
towards
public
education
segregated
by
race?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
isn't
that
a
fairly
common
in
the
public
schools
in
pennsylvania
for
students
to
be
loaned
textbooks
and
perhaps
for
the
books
to
survive
2
or
3
or
4
years?
