mr.
william
p.
thorn
mr.
chief
justice
and
court
please.
i
would
like
to
devote
the
minutes
that
i
have
to
attempting
to
answer
some
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised.
first
of
all
i
believe
it
was
mr.
justice
stewart
who
asked
the
question
as
to
how
the
allen
statute
could
be
distinguished
from
the
pennsylvania
statute.
there
is
a
very
real
distinction.
in
the
allen
case,
the
statute
provided
for
the
loan
of
textbooks,
free
textbooks
to
all
school
children
in
the
state
of
new
york,
both
public
and
nonpublic.
act
195
provides
only
for
the
loan
of
textbooks
to
nonpublic
school
children.
now
the
act
recites
that
the
other
--
that
the
public
school
children
in
pennsylvania
already
have
the
benefit
of
free
textbooks.
however,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it's
the
local
school
board
which
provides
textbooks
to
public
school
children
in
pennsylvania
and
not
the
state.
the
state
has
singled
out
a
special
class
of
the
beneficiaries
for
which
it
is
using
tax
raised
state
revenues
for
the
support
and
administration.
mr.
william
p.
thorn
it
mandates
them
that
they
do
it.
pennsylvania
statute
mandates
that
the
local
school
board
--
mr.
william
p.
thorn
provide
--
yes.
mr.
william
p.
thorn
pardon
me?
there
is
this
distinction.
the
local
school
boards
must
raise
the
funds
to
provide
the
textbooks
from
local
revenues
not
from
state
revenues.
although
the
state
reimburses
the
local
school
district
from
part
of
it
expenditures
initially,
the
expenditure
must
come
from
locally
raised
revenues.
mr.
william
p.
thorn
well
that's
very
complicated
formula.
i
believed
it's
approximately
50%.
mr.
william
p.
thorn
it's
about
50%
as
i
remember.
mr.
william
p.
thorn
no
i
don't
think
so.
but
here
the
state
as
singled
out
a
special
class
of
recipients
and
as
provided
in
a
separate
channel,
a
different
channel.
mr.
william
p.
thorn
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.
thorn
that
is
correct
but
public
schools
do
not
initially
--
mr.
william
p.
thorn
yes
except
different
taxation,
different
sources
of
funds.
now
the
second
thing
that
i'd
like
to
speak
too
is
the
issue
which
my
brother
ball
raised
concerning
burden
of
proof.
he
has
stated
that
it
is
our
job
to
prove
that
the
supplies
and
materials,
and
the
services
mandated
by
these
statutes
are
being
misused
for
religious
purposes.
however,
it
is
not
our
burden
at
all.
this
court
has
held
in
several
instances
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
state
to
make
certain,
given
the
religion
clauses
that
subsidized
teachers
do
not
inculcate
religion
lemon
v.
kurtzman.
and
furthermore
the
state
must
see
to
it
that
state
supported
activity
is
not
being
used
for
religious
indoctrination
levitt
v.
committee
for
public
education
and
religious
liberty.
so
the
burden
is
not
upon
the
complainants,
but
rather
is
upon
the
state
or
commonwealth
to
prove
that.
furthermore,
there
is
a
record
and
in
the
record
we
introduced
guidelines
established
by
the
pennsylvania,
department
of
education
for
the
administration
of
this
acts
and
we
believe
this
guidelines
show
beyond
any
peradventure
of
a
doubt
that
there's
pernicious
entanglement
with
religion
by
the
state
administering
these
laws.
they
just
can't
be
administered
without
numerous
contacts
with
the
nonpublic
schools.
as
an
aside
from
one
of
our
interrogatories,
we
asked
the
defendants
to
state
whether
any
of
the
person's
employed
by
defendants
or
the
intermediate
units
provide
auxiliary
services
were
previously
employed
by
a
nonpublic
schools
to
which
they
are
assigned.
the
answer
of
the
state
is
that
there
are
some
situations
where
this
does
exist.
in
other
words
what
has
been
done
in
some
situations
is
simply
take
auxiliary
service
personnel
from
the
nonpublic
school
payroll
and
put
it
on
the
public
school
payroll.
mr.
william
p.
thorn
i
don't
believe
the
record
shows
that,
but
i
believe
that
is
true,
is
it
not?
mr.
william
p.
thorn
the
record
is
silent
on
that.
however
testing
is
one
of
the
services
provided
under
act
number
194,
but
what
testing
in
campuses
i'm
not
sure.
we
believed
the
statute
is
open
ended
that
it
could
cover
almost
anything.
mr.
william
p.
thorn
no
only
on
hearing
defects
and
i
think
speech
defects
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
record
on
those
two
things,
yes.
one
of
the
claims
of
the
defendants
is
that
the
statutes
are
self-policing.
we
believe
that
that
just
isn't
so.
obviously
the
district
court
below
did
not
think
they
were
self-policing
otherwise
it
would
not
have
rewritten
act
number
195
with
respect
to
instructional
equipment
and
that's
really
what
the
court
did
because
the
act
itself
states
that
instructional
equipment
is
to
include
projection
equipment,
recording
equipment,
laboratory
equipment
and
any
other
educational
secular
and
neutral
non-ideologically
equipment
as
maybe
a
benefit
to
the
instruction
of
nonpublic
school
children
and
are
present
here
at
to
provide
for
public
school
children.
the
court
excised
projection
equipment,
recording
equipment,
etcetera
from
the
statute.
so
in
effect,
it
rewrote
the
statute.
also
the
nonpublic
school
people
apparently
don't
think
the
acts
are
self-policing.
dr.
basinhoofer
who
testified
as
a
school
psychologist
on
behalf
of
interveners
diaz
et
al.,
and
ms.
stopper
a
speech
therapist
and
sister
mary
denise
donavan
the
coordinator
of
human
relations
education
for
the
city
of
pittsburgh
for
the
catholic
schools
of
pittsburgh,
all
said
that
they
had
been
repeatedly
warned
by
the
public
school
authorities
that
they
had
to
be
very
careful
that
none
of
these
services,
none
of
the
supplies
or
equipment
were
used
for
religious
purposes.
mr.
william
p.
thorn
well
i
think
it
tell
us
this.
it
tells
us
that
it
can't
be
done
without
constant
surveillance
or
without
constant
reminders
and
i
think
the
state
has
to
do
more
than
just
remind
them.
i
think
the
state
has
to
see
to
it
that
they're
not
used
for
religious
purposes.
since
my
time
is
about
up,
i'm
going
to
summarize
this
way.
act
number
194
provides
services
which
are
part
of
a
modern
secondary
educational
institution.
the
characterization
of
auxiliary
does
not
mean
that
they
are
auxiliary
to
the
school
system
and
simply
auxiliary
to
the
normal
instruction
program
of
the
school.
they
are
part
and
the
witnesses
for
the
interveners
testified
that
these
services
were
essential
to
modern
secondary
educational
system.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up,
so
i
won't
go
on
with
my
argument.
