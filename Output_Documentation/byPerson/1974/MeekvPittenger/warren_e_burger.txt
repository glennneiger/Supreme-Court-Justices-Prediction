chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-1765,
meek
against
pittenger.
mr.
pfeffer
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
mr.
pfeffer
that
you're
going
to
treat
each
of
these
separately
at
some
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
speaking
for
myself
that
would
be
very
helpful.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
you'd
agree
mr.
pfeffer
that
at
the
time
that
the
first
amendment
was
drafted,
there
were
no
services
of
the
kind
we
now
embrace
in
these
areas.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i'll
put
it
another
way,
you
didn't
have
all
the
range
of
services
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
provided
that
you
have
today.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
religion
clauses
deal
with
any
aspect
of
discrimination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
[voice
overlap]
the
first
amendment
did
it,
in
norwood?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
pfeffer,
i
take
that
you
have
worked
out
your
arrangements
with
your
â€“
counsel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless,
i
think
you
had
a
signal
on
it
sometime
ago.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
going
to
reserve
the
entire
remaining
time
for
rebuttal?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
thorn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
did,
you
are
now
cutting
in
to
your
colleague's
turn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
blewitt,
you
needn't
use
very
much
your
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
clarify
for
me
at
least
your
comment
about
the
curtailment
of
the
equipment
loans.
you
suggest
there
was
an
alteration
of
the
program
on
the
equipment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
slides
and
movie
projectors
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
get
at
least
part
of
mr.
pfeffer's
argument
is
that
is
not
feasible
to
conduct
monitoring
of
that
to
see
that
it
is
--
that
the
statute
complied
with.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
it
passes
from
his
control,
then
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
take
it
your
point
that
you
made
earlier
that
the
modification
of
the
guidelines
has
taken
care
of
these
problems
that
is
equipment
which
could
be
used
either
for
secular
or
sectarian
purposes
is
now
out
of
the
program?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
blewitt,
mr.
reath.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
reath.
mr.
thorn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
tell
us
anymore
than
the
statute
tells
us?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
thorn.
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
73-1765,
meek
versus
pittenger
along

74-363,
united
states
against

transfer
company
will
each
be
announced
by
mr.

stewart.
