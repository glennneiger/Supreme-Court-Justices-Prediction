before
you
move
on,
it's
not
clear
to
me
what
the
discrimination
is
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
textbooks?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
boards
of
education
have
approved
a
wide
list
of
textbooks
and
then
local
school
boards
and
sometimes
the
local
superintendent
or
even
the
teachers
in
the
classes
have
discretion
as
which
books
they
use.
now,
in
my
understanding
if
i
am
in
error,
i
wish
you'd
correct
me,
is
that
all
of
the
school
books
available
on
loan
under
this
pennsylvania
statute
are
school
books
which
have
been
approved
for
use
in
the
public
schools
of
pennsylvania?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
how
there
can
be
ended
discrimination?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

mr.
ball?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

does
the
evidence
show
the
extent
of
which
these
services
are
available
in
religious
schools
without
the
benefit
of
the
state
aid?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
percentage
of
the
school
budget
is
provided
by
state
funds?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that'd
be
above
average.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
thorn
does
the
record
show
whether
or
not
the
private
schools
in
pennsylvania
require
their
pupils
to
take
the
same
standardized
achievement
tests
that
are
required
in
the
public
schools?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
the
record
this
silent
on
that
question?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
comparative
test
scores
between
students
in
the
public
and
private
schools,
is
there?
