case
involve
all
three
auxiliary
services
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
instructional
materials
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
textbooks?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
were
the
differences?
justice
potter
stewart
the
money
was
given,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
about
auxiliary
services?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
instructional
materials?
justice
potter
stewart
similar
or
the
same?
justice
potter
stewart
in
1787
of
course
the
first
amendment,
you
said
a
minute
ago,
the
way
you
read
the
first
amendment
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
first
amendment
that
would
suggest
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
it
begins
congress
shall
make
no
law.
this
doesn't
involve
anything
that
congress
has
done.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
not
be
back
in
1787,
it
didn't.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
understand
your
point
a
moment
ago
that
schools
providing
these
services
do
not
qualify
as
compulsory
attendance
schools?
justice
potter
stewart
the
provision
of
these
services
is
irrelevant
to
this
status
as
qualifying
as
compulsory,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
these
services
are
just
to
â€“
just
to
clear
my
mind,
these
services
are
provided
in
the
public
schools,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
long
been?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ball,
what's
the
record
show
about
these
people?
do
they
spend
all
of
there
occupational
time
in
one
school
or
they
move
around
from
school
to
school
or
what?
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
geographic
area?
justice
potter
stewart
might
she
move
then
from
a
catholic
parochial
school
on
where
she
is
on
tuesday
afternoons
to
lutheran
parochial
school
on
wednesday
afternoon
--
justice
potter
stewart
to
nominational
parochial
school
on
thursday
afternoon?
justice
potter
stewart
and
ever
back,
ever
into
a
public
school
on
friday
and
monday
afternoons?
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
doesn't
show
what
the
actual
practice
is.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
respect.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
claim
is
that
of
course
that
these
teachers
get
so
imbued
and
involved
with
the
religious
atmosphere
over
a
particular
school
that
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
that
the
question
would
might
have
something
to
do
with
that
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
on
marburger,
is
somebody
one
your
side
of
the
table
is
going
to
deal
with
marburger?
justice
potter
stewart
the
biggest
difference
or
at
least
a
very
substantial
difference
between
this
case
in
marburger
is
that
here
you
have
a
record
of
evidence
and
testimony
and
in
marburger
you
just
have
the
bare
bones
of
the
statute
aid
by
speculations
and
imagination,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
your
brother
is
asking
us
to
overrule
allen,
and
you're
suggesting
we
overrule
marburger,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
it
must
be
state
laws
that
authorizes
the
local
school
boards
to
do
the
same
thing
for
public
schools.
justice
potter
stewart
for
public
school
children?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
there
is
no
distinction?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
you
agree
that
it's
constitutionally
irrelevant
as
to
where
and
how
the
financing
comes
from
so
long
as
it
is
we
all
agree
for
the
governmental
financing.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
mistaken
in
understanding
that
this
law
here
at
issue
gives
to
the
students
in
private
schools
what
is
already
and
has
been
for
a
long
time
given
to
the
students
in
public
school?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
correct
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
both
with
public
money?
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
of
these
cases,
meek
against
pittenger
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania.
in
this
case
we
are
required
to
determined
once
again
whether
a
state
law
providing
assistance
to
non-public
church
related
elementary
and
secondary
schools
is
constitutional
under
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
made
applicable
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
with
the
stated
purpose
of
assuring
that
every
school
child
in
the
commonwealth
would
equitably
share
in
the
benefits
of
auxiliary
services,
textbooks,
and
instructional
material,
provided
free
of
charge
to
children
attending
public
schools,
the
pennsylvania
general
assembly
in
1972
added
acts
194
and
195
to
its
public
school
code.
act
194
authorizes
the
commonwealth
to
provide
auxiliary
services
so-called
to
all
children
enrolled
in
non-public
elementary
and
secondary
schools
that
meet
pennsylvania's
compulsory
attendance
requirements.
auxiliary
services
as
defined
in
the
statute
include
counseling,
testing
and
psychological
services,
speech
and
hearing
therapy,
teaching
and
related
services
for
exceptional
children,
for
remedial
students,
and
for
the
educationally
disadvantaged.
act
195
authorizes
the
state
secretary
of
education
to
lend
textbooks
without
charge
to
children
attending
non-public
elementary
and
secondary
schools
that
meet
the
commonwealth's
compulsory
attendance
requirements.
the
books
that
may
be
lent
are
limited
to
those
which
are
acceptable
for
use
in
any
public
elementary
or
secondary
school
of
the
commonwealth.
act
195
also
authorizes
the
secretary
of
education
of
pennsylvania
to
lend
directly
to
the
non-public
schools
instructional
materials
and
equipment
useful
to
the
education
of
non-public
school
children.
instructional
materials
are
defined
to
include
periodicals,
photographs,
maps,
charts,
sound
recordings,
films,
or
any
other
printed
and
published
material
of
a
similar
nature.
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
case
unanimously
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
textbook
loan
program
authorized
by
act
195.
by
a
divided
vote,
the
court
also
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
act
194's
provision
of
auxiliary
services
to
children
in
non-public
elementary
and
secondary
schools
and
act
195's
authorization
of
loans
of

material
directly
to
non-public
elementary
and
secondary
schools.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court

auxiliary
services
and
instructional
materials
and
equipment.
