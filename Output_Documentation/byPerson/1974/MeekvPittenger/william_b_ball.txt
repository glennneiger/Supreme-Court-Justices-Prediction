mr.
william
b.
ball
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
going
to
have
a
division
of
argument
among
the
co-counsel.
i'll
address
myself
principally
to
act
194,
the
auxiliary
services
act,
and
mr.
blewitt
for
the
commonwealth
is
going
to
concentrate
mainly
on
act
195,
and
mr.
reath
is
going
to
discuss
various
related
aspects
of
this
litigation.
for
years
the
state
educational
authorities
in
the
various
states
have
recognized
that
there
are
individual
children
in
the
schools
who
need
special
help.
and
in
response
to
this,
the
states
have
provided
and
identified
certain
kinds
of
services
which
can
help
these
children.
now
many
of
these
relate
to
health,
while
others
relate
to
learning
disabilities
and
they
all
interrelate
in
a
school
situation,
first,
because
that's
where
the
learning
takes
place
and
that's
the
place
which
is
most
useful
to
afford
services
for
the
correction
of
deficiencies
or
the
affording
of
health.
and
i
might
mention
also
that
these
services
are
also
very
much
tied
into
aid
to
families.
if
it
please
the
court,
we
have
in
this
chamber
this
very
moment
a
child
to
whom
we
refer
in
footnote
5
of
our
brief,
a
little
girl
named
janna
bents
who
had
a
95%
decibel
loss
of
hearing,
she
is
deaf.
this
related
intimately
to
the
fact
that
she
could
not
well
carry
any
kind
of
learning
process
and
thirdly,
these
had
all
manner
of
repercussions
on
the
life
of
the
family
quite
obviously.
now,
these
services
have
been
known
as
adjunct
services
they've
been
called
or
auxiliary
services,
supportive
services
and
so
on.
ten
years
ago
the
congress
of
the
united
states
in
the
elementary
and
secondary
education
act,
spoke
of
specialized
services
and
identified
them
for
the
benefit
of
all
children.
pennsylvania
for
years
had
been
furnishing
auxiliary
services
to
children
in
the
public
schools
of
the
state.
in
1972
they
made
this
program
general
by
including
all
children
under
the
benefits
of
auxiliary
services.
i'm
going
to
discuss
the
auxiliary
services
program
in
detail
in
a
moment
because
i
think
a
great
deal
needs
to
be
said
with
respect
to
facts.
preliminarily
however,
i
want
to
divert
the
--
a
line
of
my
argument
to
go
in
to
the
matter
of
the
trial
which
forms
the
record
upon
which
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
was
based.
i
think
that's
important
to
do
your
honors,
because
the
programs
have
been
attacked
largely
on
presumptions
of
fact.
presumptions
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
the
act
and
how
it
works,
presumptions
with
respect
to
employees
of
the
state
who
carry
out
the
act
and
how
they
behave
and
presumptions
with
respect
to
religious
schools.
we
knew
at
the
beginning
of
this
litigation
that
these
allegations
and
assertions
were
totally
at
variants
with
reality.
and
therefore,
we
decided
that
the
prudent
thing
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
case
and
the
best
way
to
achieve
justice
would
be
to
put
the
program
on
the
stand,
and
then
let
the
eminent
counsel
for
the
plaintiffs
have
that
witnesses,
live
witnesses
not
stipulated
facts
that
can't
be
cross-examined
but
put
on
the
stand
parents,
put
on
the
stand
administrators,
put
on
the
stand
teachers
who
carry
out
the
program
and
then
permit
their
credibility
to
be
gone
after.
if
they
weren't
credible
let
it
be
shown,
if
they
were
not
typical
let
that
be
shown.
if
they
were
highly
selective
and
not
typical
let
that
be
shown.
but,
here
with
--
at
counsel
tap
what
was
indicated
to
be
a
simply
an
ocean
of
universally
accepted
fact
about
all
these
matters,
when
the
time
came
to
bring
on
the
tidal
wave
of
fact
and
get
away
from
the
world
of
presumption,
the
plaintiffs
came
up
bone
dry.
they
declined
to
cross-examine
a
single
witness.
they
did
not
put
on
one
piece
of
evidence
or
one
witness
rather,
to
contradict
what
we
through
our
witnesses
we
think
had
established.
now,
the
significance
of
that
is
this,
if
it
pleases
the
court.
i
think
the
plaintiffs
are
asking
the
court
to
ignore
facts
and
to
ignore
this
record.
how
little
in
fact
zero
discussion
we
have
heard
just
now
of
this
record,
and
to
follow,
they
beckoned
the
court
to
follow
them
in
to
a
neverland
where
valuable
social
programs
maybe
comfortably
disposed
of
by
talk
of
potential,
of
danger,
of
values,
of
likelihood
of
it
maybe
just
that
in
substitution
for
fact.
may
i
now
cover
act
194
under
three
headings?
first
of
all
with
respect
to
its
subject
matter
then
with
respect
to
its
administration
and
then
with
respect
to
its
teachers.
the
subject
matter
is
the
services,
services
directly
to
children.
none
of
these
services
are
required
under
pennsylvania's
compulsory
attendance
law,
and
therefore
a
school
affording
these
services
does
not
by
that
fact
qualify
as
a
compulsory
attendance
school.
the
services
of
their
nature
by
statute
and
by
practice
are
secular,
are
neutral,
are
none
ideological.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no,
by
the
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
afford
speech
therapy
psychological
service
and
so
on,
those
facts,
those
services
do
not
qualify
them
as
compulsory
attendance
schools.
the
meaning
of
it
is
this
mr.
justice
powell
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
hold
themselves
out
as
affording
these
services
does
not
give
them
any
status
in
the
school
market,
whatever
because
they
are
ultimately
because
of
that
compulsory
attendance
schools.
they
must
meet
the
requirements
to
compulsory
attendance
law
to
the
units
through
which
the
services
maybe
accorded
to
children.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
justice
stewart,
pardon
me.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
services
are
also
obviously
of
immediate
and
meaningful
benefit
to
children,
the
record
very
definitely
establishes
that.
if
we
needed
greater
testimony
with
respect
to
these
services
we
have
that
of
eminent
counsel
mr.
pfeffer
who
told
the
court
below
we
do
not
in
the
least
challenge
the
testimony
presented
by
the
defense
that
these
services
are
invaluable
to
children.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
and
they
have
long
been.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes,
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
stewart.
these
services
he
said
were
in
valuable
to
children,
to
the
deaf
children,
to
the
otherwise
disadvantaged
children.
we
do
not
in
the
least
challenge
that.
coming
to
the
administration
of
these
services;
oh
by
the
way,
i
ought
to
mention
one
thing
before
passing
to
that,
mr.
pfeffer
had
stated
in
this
argument
now
that
the
provision
of
the
guideline
which
speaks
of
bringing
below
grade
children
to
grade
levels
status,
act
equals
in
effect
the
affording
of
normal
services
by
the
nonpublic
school
through
the
services
of
the
intermediate
unit.
the
court
below
faced
that
and
we
have
alluded
to
that
at
page
16
of
our
brief.
the
court
found
that
contention
to
be
without
substance
and
it
did
so
on
the
following
grounds
that
first
of
all
auxiliary
services
are
by
and
large
not
mandated
as
part
of
basic
curriculum
in
pennsylvania,
and
this
we
have
shown
by
the
regulations
of
the
state
board
of
education
which
we
cite
at
page
16.
by
and
large,
the
services
are
totally
new
to
nonpublic
school
children,
a
fact
which
also
the
general
assembly
very
clearly
declared
in
this
act.
and
if
you
read
this
to
mean
that
these
services
are
simply
ordinary
general
services
of
the
schools
we
have
contradicted
any
meaning
which
the
general
assembly
and
the
department
of
education
have
given
to
the
term
of
auxiliary
services.
in
administering
the
act,
we
come
to
the
year
1970
in
which
the
commonwealth
enacted
into
law
the
intermediate
unit
services
act,
this
was
well
prior
to
the
existence
of
the
present
legislation
that
i'm
discussing.
this
created
29
entities
in
the
state
which
would
afford
technical
and
planning
services
to
clusters
of
public
school
districts.
and
it
is
this
--
and
a
unit
of
the
public
educational
system
which
administers
this
act,
it
does
so
and
administers
the
act
on
the
premises
of
the
nonpublic
schools
first
of
all
because
this
affording
of
auxiliary
services
had
always
been
presented
in
that
way
on
the
premises
of
the
school
where
the
child
is.
secondly,
it's
clear
that
it
is
the
only
place
in
which
these
services
can
be
usefully
and
meaningfully
afforded
to
children.
the
testimony
that
we
have
in
the
record
from
dr.
horrowitz
who
for
ten
years
has
been
administering
esca
services
to
nonpublic
school
children
on
nonpublic
school
premises
and
who
was
also
been
the
administrator
of
act
194
in
the
school
district
of
philadelphia,
which
is
also
the
intermediate
unit
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
is
very
eloquent
to
the
fact
that
logistics,
the
transporting
of
children
are
very
much
greatly
impede
any
chance
of
meaningfully
affording
these
services
to
children.
one
witness,
mrs.
stopper,
a
speech
therapist
in
the
carbon
lehigh
union
intermediate
unit
testified
that
the
fact
that
because
of
these
kinds
of
difficulties,
and
the
case
loads
of
people
in
public
schools
it
had
not
been
possible
to
afford
auxiliary
services
to
17
out
of
350
children
needing
speech
therapy
services.
now
counsel
speaks
of
a
modest
sacrifice
in
the
transporting
of
children
to
get
these
services
else
where,
we
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
record,
the
testimony
in
particular
of
dr.
horrowitz
as
flatly
contradicting
any
assertion
that
this
is
a
modest
sacrifice
and
is
not
indeed
a
prime
means
of
defeating
the
benefits
which
this
act
recognizes,
and
public
policy
recognizes
that
all
children
need.
the
intermediate
units
administer
the
act
through
commonwealth
personnel.
there
are
people
who
are
under
the
direct
supervision
and
control
of
the
public
intermediate
units.
they
are
bound
down
by
the
school
laws
of
pennsylvania,
the
regulations
of
the
state
board
of
education
and
the
directives
of
the
intermediate
units
which
extensively
and
intensively
regulate
the
conduct
of
the
intermediate
unit
employees.
they
must
be
properly
certified
according
to
pennsylvania
code
section
49.11.
now
we
come
to
the
contention
that
the
people
who
furnish
intermediate
unit
services
create
religious
problems
and
that
this
programs
does
that.
yet
when
we
go
the
record
in
the
case,
we
find
not
a
single
instance
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
wherein
one
individual
has
abused
his
office
as
a
public
employee
in
seeking
to
“teach
religion
in
the
course
of
the
performance
of
his
professional
duties.”
on
the
other
hand,
we
have
positive,
unquestioned
and
uncontradicted
testimony
to
precisely
the
opposite
effect.
dr.
horrowitz
within
ten
years
administering
esea
programs
on
nonpublic
school
premises
testified
flatly
the
he
knew
of
no
incident
of
this
kind.
the
other
witnesses
who
have
testified
as
to
the
administration
of
the
act
testified
similarly
and
not
one
word
of
evidence
disposes
in
a
state
of
67
counties,
29
intermediate
units
and
a
program
that
is
been
going
on
since
1972,
any
instance
of
this
horrible
to
which
counsel
alludes.
we
are
here
impressed
by
the
quotation
by
mr.
justice
powell
in
nyquist,
in
which
he
quotes
from
allen
saying
that
absence,
absent
evidence
we
cannot
assume
that
school
authorities
are
enabled
to
distinguish
between
secular
and
religious
books
or
that
they
will
not
honestly
discharge
their
duties.
there
is
nothing
either
to
show
that
these
people
who
perform
for
the
intermediate
units
go
through
the
experience
which
was
assumed
in
marburger,
as
they
go
through
of
becoming
susceptible
and
contracting
religion
when
they
enter
upon
the
premises
of
a
religious
school.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
any
one
of
these
people,
these
many
employees
are
so
mentally
dimmed
that
they
can
not
understand
the
regulation
under
which
they
are
supposed
to
operate,
that
they're
so
psychologically
weak,
they
can
not
help
but
be
overcome
by
a
supposed
and
unproved
dominant
religious
atmosphere
in
a
religious
school.
that
they
are
so
professionally
shoddy
that
they
will
throw
there
professional
ethics
to
the
whims
in
order
to
divert
into
some
religion
or
other,
that
they
are
so
lawless
that
they
will
deliberately
violate
the
law
of
their
state
and
their
nation.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
record
does
not
clearly
disclose
this
mr.
justice
stewart.
my
impressions
for
what
they
are
worth,
indicates
that
the
speech
teachers,
speech
therapist
such
as
mrs.
stopper
whose
testimony
is
here,
moves
about
in
carbon
lehigh
intermediate
unit
district
which
involves
i
believe
a
couple
of
counties.
mr.
william
b.
ball
she
is
only
a
speech
therapist.
she
is
specialized
licensed
speech
therapist
so
there
would
really
be
no
occasion
for
her
to
stay
in
one
school
as
a
constant
employee
of
it.
for
one
thing
the
schools
can't
used
that
much
speech
therapy
or
what
ever
the
service
may
be.
mr.
william
b.
ball
moravian,
lutheran,
yes
indeed.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes.
mr.
william
b.
ball
this
i
could
not
say
but
she
would
be
available
to
be
used
in
public
schools
also
for
same
services
as
far
as
this
act
is
concerned,
it
would
not
affect
that.
mr.
william
b.
ball
it
doesn't
show
that
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
--
that
there
is
any
particular
pattern
and
there
may
be
no
particular
pattern
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
william
b.
ball
well
that
mr.
justice
stewart
is
the
claim
and
--
mr.
william
b.
ball
we
went
directly
to
that
contention
in
examination
of
three
witnesses.
we
asked
mrs.
stopper,
we
asked
dr.
basinhoofer,
a
lutheran
who
serves
in
catholic
schools
according
to
his
testimony
and
dr.
horrowitz.
we
asked
all
of
these
people
what
about
this
matter
of
becoming
involved
in
a
religious
school
and
thus
starting
to
reflect
religion.
this
was
very
staunchly
denied
for
example
by
dr.
basinhoofer
who
is
a
school
psychologist
who
testified
that
he
is
lutheran,
who
testified
as
to
his
experience
in
catholic
schools
and
said
that
he
wasn't
about
to
start
reflecting
lutheranism
and
certainly
not
to
start
picking
up
catholicism
from
being
present
in
a
catholic
school.
i
think
the
testimony
and
if
there
were
evidence
of
this
as
we've
said
before
the
plaintiff
said
all
the
time
in
the
world
to
bring
on
the
supposedly
enumerable
examples
of
the
very
thing
that
they
alleged
in
their
complaint.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.
ball
the
evidence
shows
first
of
all
it
was
the
finding
of
the
general
assembly
that
they
were
not
generally
available
in
religious
or
other
nonpublic
schools.
as
to
non-sectarian
schools
we
have
the
testimony
of
mr.
jarvis,
the
headmaster
of
lancaster
day
school.
we
have
the
testimony
of
mrs.
stopper
and
the
other
witnesses
in
fact
all
of
them
said,
including
parent
witnesses
who
said
that
up
to
now
they
had
not
been
available
in
their
schools.
whether
there
is
any
evidence
that
the
commonwealth
has
that
these
had
been
available
to
any
extent
in
a
sectarian
schools
is
not
known.
but
the
legislature
and
the
court
below
having
seen
all
the
evidence
concluded
firmly
that
by
and
large
these
services
were
not
available
in
non-sectarian,
including
religiously
affiliated
schools.
in
the
last
moments
that
i
have,
i'll
try
to
deal
briefly
with
the
questions
of
primary
effect
and
the
question
of
entanglement.
on
the
issue
of
primary
effect,
we
have
to
realize
that
nature
and
not
this
statute
has
singled
out
particular
children
who
need
particular
help
and
this
statute
responds
to
nature,
to
those
needs.
there
is
no
classes
singled
out
for
a
special
economic
benefit.
this
is
no
wise
comparable
situations
seen
in
sloan,
nyquist
and
so
on.
mr.
william
b.
ball
yes
i
will
do
it
right
now
mr.
justice
stewart.
marburger
first
of
all
in
terms
of
the
book
program
involved
children
as
--
the
marburger
opinion
stated
that
children
in
public
schools
were
borrowers
of
books
by
and
large
the
act
was
a
parent
reimbursement
act
whereby
nonpublic
school
children
did
not
borrow
books
but
instead
their
parents
where
given
a
cash
payment.
there
was
an
allotment
of
funds
for
each
public
school,
something
like
each
nonpublic
school,
something
like
a
bank
account
in
marburger
which
is
not
present
here.
there
was
a
further
fact,
concerning
the
marburger
case
is
that
there
was
no
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial
respecting
constitutionally
critical
facts
concerning
these
very
things
we've
been
talking
about,
whether
the
public
school
teacher
has
to
be
the
object
of
surveillance.
whether
in
nonpublic
schools
and
religious
schools
the
attempts
are
made
by
religious
authorities
to
proselyte
teachers
who
come
into
this
schools.
none
of
these
things
were
ever
reviewed
in
marburger
in
terms
of
witnesses
and
this
is
one
of
the
major
features
of
importance
of
the
record
on
this
case
that
at
long
last
we
have
witnesses
on
the
stand
who
are
able
to
testify
as
to
what
happens
in
real
life
and
not
what
happens
in
fantasy,
which
indeed
i
must
say
marburger
reflects
in
respect
of
the
issue
of
surveillance
and
entanglement.
mr.
william
b.
ball
that
mr.
justice
steward
plus
the
fact
that
i
think
marburger
in
no
wise
faithfully
followed
the
decision
of
this
court
in
board
of
education
versus
allen.
mr.
william
b.
ball
no
i
am
not
suggesting
marburger
be
overruled
because
i
cannot
read
marburger
and
i
cannot
read
the
mind
of
the
court
in
affirming
marburger.
i
am
reminded
in
the
words
of
the
chief
justice
recently
that
some
are
quick
to
use
the
district
court's
opinion
to
define
this
courts
judgment.
and
i
think
that
i
cannot
conclude
that
this
court
in
its
affirmance
with
marburger
in
any
wise
reflected
the
desire
to
overrule
allen
or
to
affirm
all
of
its
presumptions
with
respect
to
entanglement.
i
didn't
observe
whether
the
red
light
is
going
on.
mr.
william
b.
ball
thank
you.
