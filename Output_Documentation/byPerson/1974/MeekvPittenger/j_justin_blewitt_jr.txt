mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin
my
argument
by
stating
what
i
consider
to
be
two
basic
principles
that
have
run
through
all
of
this
courts
decisions
under
the
establishment
clause
as
they
relate
to
education.
first
is
that
the
state
has
a
recognized
interest
in
the
quality
of
secular
education
in
all
nonpublic
schools
and
the
second
general
observation
is
that
some
form
of
state
aid
can
be
directed
to
the
secular
function
of
the
religious
school
without
providing
there
by
direct
aid
to
the
religious
functions
of
such
schools.
this
theme
has
been
restated
in
every
establishment
clause
case
which
has
come
before
this
court.
now
the
question
then
is
does
act
195
meets
this
test?
well
answering
that
question
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
what
is
being
provided
by
the
enactment
and
i
feel
that
i
by
focusing
on
what
is
provided
the
court
will
see
that
this
enactment
passes
both
the
entanglement
and
primary
effect
test.
what
is
provided
are
three
types
of
educational
aids'
textbooks,
educational
materials
and
instructional
equipment,
a
very
limited
type
of
instructional
equipment
i
must
mention,
slide
projectors,
record
players,
instructional
equipment
of
such
form
is
not
permissible
by
virtue
of
the
district
court's
order
and
by
virtue
of
the
amended
guideline
which
we
have
submitted
to
replace
the
original
guideline
which
did
authorize
that
equipment.
now
there
are
the
three
types
of
equipment,
the
three
types
of
educational
aids
but
in
addition
these
educational
aids
have
two
characteristics.
first
they
must
be
secular,
second
as
to
textbooks
they
must
be
acceptable
for
use
in
a
public
school
and
as
for
instructional
equipment
and
materials
they
must
be
such
as
that
are
provided
in
nonpublic
schools.
so
i
think
it
is
important
to
emphasize
that
the
outset
the
plaintiffs
don't
even
claim,
much
less
make
any
attempt
to
prove
that
any
form
of
religious
material
is
being
provided
under
these
acts.
mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
yes
you
honor.
mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
the
enactment
and
the
guidelines
promulgated
pursuant
to
it
originally
had
to
have
a
very
broad
definition
of
instructional
equipment.
it
would
have
authorized
the
loan
of
slide
projectors,
overhead
projectors,
record
players,
tape
recorders.
the
district
court
i
think
fashioned
a
very
healthy
rule
by
prohibiting
the
loan
of
materials
which
are
in
the
words
of
the
district
court
readily
divertible
to
a
religious
purpose.
we
adopted,
by
not
appealing,
we
have
adopted
that
that
standard
fixed
by
the
district
court
and
we
think
it
a
healthy
standard
because
the
district
court
has
fashioned
a
concept
of
a
self-policing
educational
aid.
one
can
look
at
the
aid
and
determine
merely
by
looking
at
it
whether
or
not
it
can
perform
any
sort
of
religious
function.
now
the
appellants
have
made
some
of
attempt
to
distinguish
allen,
i
think
that
attempt
is
unavailing.
i
can
see
no
way
in
which
this
program
could
be
found
unconstitutional
and
yet
this
court
should
retain
the
vitality
of
the
allen
holding.
the
two
are
virtually
identical
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
reviewing
the
guidelines
which
implement
this
program,
this
court
look
to
the
brief
of
the
interveners
in
board
of
education
v.
allen
which
has
attached
to
it
as
an
appendix
the
guidelines
for
the
new
york
textbook
loan
program.
they
are
virtually
identical
--
mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
i
have
read
it,
but
not
recently
your
honor.
mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
i
cannot
offer
one.
but
i
think
the
point
of
allen
was
that
the
officials
who
must
make
the
decision
as
to
what
is
loaned
are
public
officials
and
deciding
whether
to
--
whether
a
given
educational
aid
is
permissible
can
be
loaned.
but
the
public
school
officials
making
the
very
same
decision
that
he
makes
all
the
time
in
deciding
what
materials
can
be
loaned
to
a
public
school.
in
essence
the
school
official
is
really
making
one
decision
no
matter
where
the
request
for
the
educational
aid
comes
from,
whether
the
request
comes
from
a
public
school
principal
or
from
the
nonpublic
schools,
he
is
making
one
decision,
is
this
acceptable
for
use
in
public
schools?
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
public
school
officials
will
not
honestly
discharge
there
duty
or
there
unable
to
distinguish
between
religious
and
secular
materials.
so
i
think
it
is
important
that
what
we
are
here
providing
is
tangible
educational
aids.
their
content
is
ascertainable
in
advance.
the
aids
themselves
by
there
very
nature,
and
by
virtue
of
the
necessary
prior
approval
of
the
public
school
authorities
cannot
be
diverted
to
a
religious
use.
they
are
self-policing
and
i
think
this,
the
concept
of
self-policing
is
not
only
important,
but
essential
to
our
case
for
the
concept
of
self-policing
in
and
of
itself
answers
two
questions.
it
answers
the
primary
effect
question
and
the
entanglement
question.
because
the
material
cannot
be
used
for
religious
purpose
then
it
is
being
restricted
exclusively
to
a
secular
use
and
therefore
there
is
no
danger
of
a
primary
effect
of
advancing
religion
because
the
--
mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
but
your
honor,
what
we
suggest
is
that
no
such
monitoring
is
necessary.
the
school
official
who
decides
what
is
to
be
loaned
--
mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
material
is
not
can
not
readily
be
used
for
religious
purpose.
that
spectrum
was
present
in
allen
you
know
you
can
not
decide
what
a
teacher
is
going
to
do
with
a
secular
textbook.
mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice?
mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
well
we
consider
it
be
a
loan
in
a
same
--
the
act
refers
to
the
legal
relationship
as
a
loan
and
it
is
the
same
form
of
loan
that
was
present
before
the
court
in
the
allen
case.
mr.
justice
white
in
writing
the
opinion
acknowledged
that
ownership
at
least
technically
remains
with
the
state
so
the
concept
of
loan
is
equally
the
same
as
in
allen
as
in
here.
i
am
sure
that
the
textbooks
which
were
loaned
to
the
private
schools
in
allen
are
no
longer
functional.
they
have
long
since
lost
there
utility,
but
i
mean
that
was
the
factor
that
was
present
in
allen
and
was
not
deemed
controlling.
mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
oh!
yes
your
honor
absolutely.
and
of
course
that
feature
of
the
act,
it
was
a
point
made
in
our
brief,
but
since
you
touched
upon
it
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
argument
has
been
made
that
this
is
class
legislation.
well
it
certainly
is
not
class
legislation
because
what
is
being
provided
here
for
the
nonpublic
school
students
is
being
provided
through
other
provisions
of
the
public
school
code
for
public
school
students.
this
court
in
nyquist
recognized
that
direct
aid
in
any
form
is
invalid
absent
affective
means
of
assuring
that
the
â€“
whether
this
loan
would
be
used
exclusively
for
a
secular
purpose.
here
the
guarantee
comes
from
the
nature
of
the
equipment
loaned.
it
can
not
be
diverted
to
any
other
than
its
original
purpose.
every
school
aid
program,
excuse
me,
every
educational
program
which
dealt
with
private
schools
which
has
reached
this
court
since
allen
has
dealt
with
money,
cash
subsidies
of
one
form
or
another
to
private
schools
or
private
schools
students.
and
of
course
they
trouble
with
money
probably
its
only
trouble,
is
that
money
--
when
money
is
provided
it
must
carry
with
it
restrictions
on
its
use.
it
must
be
earmarked
for
a
particular
purpose
and
to
the
extent
that
the
earmarking
takes
on
a
pervasive
character,
the
other
objection
the
charybdis
of
the
establishment
clause
would
be
violated,
would
give
rise
to
undo
entanglement.
mr.
j.
justin
blewitt,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
promised
my
colleague
i
will
make
one
point
in
one
minute.
and
that
is
the
point
that
appellants
make
through
out
there
brief
of
examples
of
how
some
of
these
educational
aids
can
be
subverted
to
a
religious
purpose.
i
submit
in
the
first
instance
that
they
are
hypothetical
in
every
sense
of
the
word,
these
examples.
in
a
dictionary
sense,
they're
not
based
on
facts.
no
proof
has
been
offered
that
materials
or
that
such
examples
is
that
they
hypothecate
have
ever
in
fact
occurred.
furthermore,
such
possibilities
were
equally
present
in
allen
and
this
court
wisely
refused
to
resort
to
this
form
of
conjecture.
the
third
aspect
of
the
hypothetical
nature
of
these
examples
is
that
there
predicated
on
bad
faith.
they
suggest
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
nonpublic
school
personnel
who
would
be
using
these
materials.
there
is
no
record
of
bad
faith
in
this
case.
in
fact
there
is
a
record
of
good
faith.
i
refer
the
court
specifically
to
page
a92
of
the
appendix.
this
court
in
tilton
recognized
that
a
possibility
always
exists
of
a
law's
legitimate
purposes
being
subverted
by
conscious
design
or
lacks
enforcement.
the
court
recognized
that
such
possibilities
standing
alone
are
--
do
not
warrant
striking
down
a
statute
that
is
unconstitutional,
this
is
important
state
action
and
it
should
not
be
invalidated
on
the
basis
of
hypothesis.
thank
you.
