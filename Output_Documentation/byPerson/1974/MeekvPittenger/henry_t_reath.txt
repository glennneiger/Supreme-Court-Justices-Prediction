mr.
henry
t.
reath
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
in
a
few
minutes
left
to
me
to
first
restate
the
issue
which
i
think
has
been
fully
argued.
and
the
issue
is
should
this
court
exercise
its
admitted
power
to
invalidate
a
state
action
where
the
legislation
under
attack
has
to
proven
primary
purpose
and
effect
of
improving
children's
learning
and
communication
skills
and
where
there
is
no
disqualifying
provision
in
the
statute,
denying
such
benefits
to
children
attending
religious
schools.
i
appear
this
afternoon,
if
your
honors
please,
on
behalf
of
two
parents
and
two
children
attending
private
independent
schools.
i
also
serve
as
counsel
for
the
pennsylvania
association
of
independent
schools.
i'm
appearing
essentially
as
the
spokesman
for
the
independent
schools
and
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
say
i
of
course
join
in
the
arguments
made
by
predecessors,
and
i
also
join
in
the
brief
that
was
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
counsel
for
american
private
education.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
take
this
court's
time
to
dwell
or
emphasize
some
basic
constitutional
principles
which
is
that
there
is
a
strong
presumption
of
validity
to
the
propriety
of
state
action
and
that
one
who
seeks
to
overturn
it
has
a
very
heavy
burden.
and
i
believe
based
on
the
arguments
that
mr.
ball
and
mr.
blewitt
have
made
that
it
has
been
shown
how
they
have
utterly
failed
to
meet
this
burden.
they
have
offered
no
evidence
whatsoever.
mr.
pfeffer
in
his
argument
made
a
charge
which
i
submit
was
totally
unwanted
and
not
in
this
record,
a
charge
of
discrimination.
there
is
no
evidence
of
discrimination
in
this
record
and
that
is
fully
developed
in
our
brief
at
page
19
and
i
won't
take
my
valuable
time
now
to
answer.
secondly,
as
far
as
the
availability
of
these
auxiliary
services
are
concerned
under
the
present
statute,
they
are
now
equally
available
to
children
in
parochial
schools,
in
private
schools
or
in
public
schools
and
there
is
complete
and
total
freedom
of
choice
among
the
children
as
to
which
of
those
school
systems
that
they
would
use
to
avail
themselves
to
those
benefits.
secondly,
if
your
honor
please,
and
i
think
that
this
is
very
clear,
i've
referred
to
it
at
page
13
of
our
brief.
in
everson,
the
court
had
this
very
issue
before
it
where
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
state
of
new
jersey
could
exclude
the
benefits
--
certain
benefits
to
children
in
religious
schools
and
here
is
what
the
court
said.
“while
we
do
not
mean
to
intimate
that
a
state
could
not
provide
transportation
only
to
children
attending
public
schools,
we
must
be
careful
in
protecting
the
citizens
of
new
jersey
against
state
established
churches
to
be
sure
that
we
will
not
inadvertently
prohibit
new
jersey
from
extending
its
general
state
law
benefits
to
all
its
citizens
without
regard
of
their
religious
beliefs.
and
the
record
shows
here
an
equivocally
that
these
are
general
state
benefits
now
offered
to
all
children
regardless
of
their
race,
religion,
color
or
creed.
finally,
i
would
submit
and
again
i've
developed
this
argument
at
page
35
of
our
brief
and
i
incorporated
in
my
argument
that
it
would
be
impermissible
and
highly
unconstitutional
for
pennsylvania
to
attempt
to
inquire
into
the
religious
practices
or
beliefs
of
any
child
in
order
to
determine
whether
that
child
was
eligible
to
receive
the
benefits.
it
would
be
a
denial
of
the
equal
protection
at
the
free
exercise
arguments
which
these
plaintiffs
seemed
to
claim
to
represent
in
attacking
this
legislation.
now
if
your
honor
please,
i
would
like
next
to
very
briefly
refer
to
this
court's
decision
in
pearl
v.
nyquist
and
lemon
v.
sloan
because
i
would
submit
that
that
is
our
point
of
departure.
and
this
court
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
by
mr.
justice
powell,
held
and
struck
down
tuition
reimbursement
and
tax
credit
because
it
was
felt
that
this
conferred
in
some
fashion
or
rather
a
special
benefit
on
children
and
parents
who
were
attending
religious
schools
and
thus
have
the
disqualifying
effect
of
being,
having
a
primary
purpose
of
aiding
religion.
at
the
same
time,
the
court
in
mr.
justice
powell's
opinion
rebuffed
the
very
same
arguments
that
are
being
advanced
here
and
have
been
advanced
before
and
that
is
there
must
be
an
absolute
wall
of
separation
and
that
there
must
be
an
absolute
ban
on
the
provision
of
any
form
of
public
aid
to
nonpublic
education.
and
there
the
majority
held
that
aid
still
can
be
channeled
albeit
it
may
be
a
narrow
channel.
happily
this
court
did
give
us
some
aids
to
navigation.
and
the
aids
to
navigation
i
believe
were
these;
one
to
pass
muster
it
must
not
be
class
legislation.
it
must
be
something
available
equally
to
everybody.
two;
it
must
be
neutral
non-ideological.
three;
it
must
be
indirect.
four;
it
must
be
of
only
of
incidental
benefit.
i
submit
that
pennsylvania
acts
194
and
195
in
all
respects
stay
within
the
narrow
channel
prescribed.
it
is
not
class
legislation,
it
benefits
all
children.
it
is
neutral
and
non-ideological.
it
deals
with
the
tools
for
learning
and
the
ability
to
improve
ones
communication
and
learning
skills.
it
is
indirect.
no
payments
are
made
to
the
schools.
the
benefits
are
given
to
the
children.
there
is
no
real
benefit
to
the
school
directly
because
at
most
it
could
be
deemed
incidental
in
that,
again
the
benefit
goes
to
the
children
and
not
to
the
schools.
it
is
self-policing.
there
is
no
problem
of
entanglement.
a
perfect
example
of
that
mr.
chief
justice
to
elaborate
a
question
your
honor
asked
earlier
was
that
this
court,
the
lower
court
said
for
example
“we
will
not
permit
you
to
lend
moving
picture
projectors
because
a
moving
a
projector
could
be
used
to
show
a
religious
film.”
so
that
those
are
out.
any
kind
of
a
training
aid
that
could
lend
itself
to
be
used
to
for
religious
purpose
is
excluded.
what
is
left
is
only
a
self-policing
type
of
auxiliary
teaching
material
or
a
textbook
or
a
service
that
deals
not
with
the
core
of
the
educational
program,
but
deals
with
such
things
as
remedial
reading
to
improve
the
learning
skills
and
the
communication
skills
of
our
children.
and
i
submit
therefore
that
in
all
respects,
we
have
met
the
test
of
the
nyquist
case
and
the
chief
justice's
admonishing
in
lemon
v.
kurtzman.
there
are
in
acts
194
and
195
none
of
the
evils
which
this
court
has
been
concerned
about,
the
evils
of
sponsorship,
financial
support
or
active
involvement
by
the
sovereign
in
religious
activity.
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
say
this
your
honors
please.
i
think
that
we
in
this
country
have
placed
a
very
high
priority
on
the
role
of
education
and
the
role
of
our
judiciary
in
preserving
and
strengthening
a
free
democratic
society.
as
to
the
role
of
education,
i
would
submit
that
we
state
the
very
survival
of
the
republic
on
illiterate,
educated,
informed
and
hopefully
enlightened
citizenry.
we
have
had
a
love
affair
in
this
country
with
education
and
rightly
so
because
through
education
it
makes
us
free.
at
page
10,
i
have
a
quotation
in
my
brief
the
only
one
i
want
to
read
from
lord
braum
henry
peter,
the
eminent
english
statesman,
jurist
and
scientist
where
he
said,
“education
makes
a
people
easy
to
lead,
but
difficult
to
drive,
easy
to
govern
but
impossible
to
enslave.”
secondly
as
to
the
role
of
the
judiciary,
recent
events
and
a
landmark
decision
by
this
court
have
highlighted
the
critical
role
of
the
judiciary
as
the
fulcrum
in
disputes
between
branches
of
government
and
between
the
people
and
government.
and
to
perform
this
function
of
necessity,
it
has
and
it
must
have
great
power,
including
the
power
to
invalidate
state
action.
but
i
would
submit
that
matters
involving
state
action
it
must
be
--
this
power
must
be
used
sparingly
and
particularly
in
matters
of
state
action
only
where
there
is
a
clearly
proved
and
patent
infringement
of
constitutional
rights
not
found
in
this
case.
in
respect
of
state
action,
we
are
now
witnessing
and
in
large
measure
spurred
on
by
this
court's
decision
in
baker
v.
carr
and
its
progeny,
the
development
of
what
might
be
called
a
new
federalism.
a
return
swing
of
the
pendulum
which
recognizes
that
we're
going
to
put
more
of
responsibility
and
power
on
the
individual
states
to
work
out
in
harmony
with
the
federal
government
to
solve
the
vexing
problems
that
beset
our
society.
and
i
submit
this
is
good
and
it
should
be
encouraged
for
only
by
trial
and
error
by
the
process
of
experimentation,
can
we
chart
a
safe
course
that
will
give
us
the
answer
to
constitutionally
valid
tests.
the
people
of
pennsylvania
through
their
duly
elected
representatives
have
determined
that
this
form
of
legislation
is
desirable
to
strengthen
their
commitment
to
the
working
of
free
democracy
to
education,
to
enable
these
children
to
have
the
learning
skills
and
the
communication
skills
that
they
need.
anyone
who
would
deny
the
--
and
i
submit
that
this
is
proper,
anyone
who
would
deny
the
power
of
the
states
to
do
this
has
a
very
heavy
burden
and
that
burden
i
submit
has
not
been
met
in
this
case.
we
ask
your
honorable
court
to
deny
the
appeal
and
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
below.
