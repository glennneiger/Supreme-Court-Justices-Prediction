mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir,
mr.
justice
and
it
please
the
court.
the
republican
plan
was
a
plan
submitted
to
the
council.
it
was
apparently
never
voted
on
to
consider,
the
naacp
plan
was
a
plan
submitted
to
the
city
council
to
consider
in
its
redistricting
the
i
would
specifically
mention
so
there's
no
confusion
to
this
court
that
we
are
not
supporting
the
naacp
plan
nor
have
we
ever
and
the
evidence
indicates
that
this
came
up
in
the
trial
court.
evidence
in
this
case
indicated
that
the
naacp
plan
was
submitted
as
a
political
expedient,
a
plan
which
that
group
thought
might
possibly
be
passed
by
the
council
and
be
little
less
worse
than
some
other
plan.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
i
think
the
naacp
plan
also
discriminates
against
black
voters
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
a
little
less
worse
if
you
want
but
no
significant
difference.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
now,
in
that
sort
of
series
of
question
opposing
mr.
wallace
in
which
i
think
this
is
sort
of
suggesting
and
goes
to
what
is
the
dilution
in
this
case
and
what
is
the
standard
under
section
5
and
does
that
standard
somehow
require
some
sort
of
reverse
or
benign
gerrymandering.
i'd
like
to
address
that
in
this
way.
i
believe
the
intention
of
congress
in
enacting
section
5
particularly
as
it
relates
to
redistricting
plans
is
set
out
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
that
history,
there
is
a
repeated
reference
to
the
problem
that
once
black
voters
get
registered
in
significant
numbers
because
of
the
application
of
other
sections
of
the
act,
they
would
still
be
faced
in
certain
areas
under
certain
political
circumstances
with
being
cut
off
from
the
political
process.
cut
off
at
the
last
step
by
districting
lines
which
would
divide
up
these
newly
concentrated,
newly
enfranchised
concentrations
of
black,
submerge
them
in
majority
white
districts
and
therefore
by
effectively
divide
and
conquer
this
vote.
now,
the
hearings
before
congress
particularly
didn't
leave
it
just
at
that.
the
congress
was
well
aware
of
the
practices
for
instance
of
bloc
voting,
of
non-responsiveness
in
these
jurisdictions
to
the
distinct
interest
of
this
minority.
in
this
case
as
well,
the
district
court,
if
you
won't
reexamine
perhaps
unnecessarily
but
reexamine
in
regard
to
new
orleans
whether
it
was
--
whether
these
type
of
factors
existed
there
and
they
did
find
that
for
instance,
in
new
orleans
up
to
--
there
was
a
large
increase
in
black
voting
that
there
was
in
fact
a
division
of
this
black
voting
surrounding
that
there
had
been
bloc
voting
in
new
orleans
and
that
the
key
--
that
there
had
never
been
a
black
elected
to
the
city
council
and
that
the
city
council
have
failed
historically
and
continued
to
fail
to
respond
to
the
distinct
interest
of
the
minority.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
your
honor,
yes.
i
think
when
there
is
a
particular
where
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
particularly
here
your
honor
where
plan
i
for
instance
had
been
objected
to.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
once
you
have
a
violation
of
section
5
of
this
sort
that
has
divided
the
black
concentration
to
remedy
obviously
is
to
not
divide
the
concentration.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
under
of
course
with
the,
you
know
the
evidence
and
proof
of
this
case.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
i
think
it
is
a
concentration,
your
honor.
of
course,
the
district
court
did
find
it
to
be
so
considering
other
evidence
besides
just
looking
at
the
map
of
course,
but
if
the
court
for
instance
would
examine
the
larger
map
which
is
originally
in
exhibit
can
see
that
these
areas
are
cut
off
effectively
from
white
areas
to
the
north
and
the
south
and
that
it
composes
of
rather
consistent
band
of
concentration
of
blacks
throughout
the
center
of
the
new
orleans
that
are
effectively
cut
off
from
white
communities
by
natural
boundaries,
cemeteries,
lakes,
canals,
and
so
on.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
that
you
know,
there's
no
question
under
section
5
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
upon
the
plaintiffs
who
demonstrate
that
both
the
plan
lacks
a
discriminatory
purpose
and
lacks
a
discriminatory
effect.
i
think
there's
no
question
as
to
the
wording
of
the
statute.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
do
indeed.
there's,
you
know,
and
also
i
would
note
particularly
in
this
case
that
that
the
burden
question
doesn't
become
particularly
significant
because
the
facts
in
the
case
were
basically
not
in
dispute
and
wherever
the
burden
happens
to
be,
you
tilt
that
is
shifted,
is
not
specially
significant
particularly
in
regard
to
the
effect.
i
think
you
were
arguing
primary
legal
standard
and
that
there
isn't
much
contest
as
to
precisely
what
the
facts
are.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
not
necessary
reset.
however,
i
think
there
is
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
they
predetermined
the
question
of
purpose.
i
think
the
question
of
purpose
however
that
there's
ample
evidence
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose
and
that
would
provide
an
alternative
basis
for
this
court's
affirmance.
particularly,
the
bad
faith
of
the
council
from
plan
i
to
plan
ii,
that
act
has
affirmatively
rejected
plan
i.
plan
ii
was
hardly
a
good
faith
but
to
correct
that.
also
i
think
the
courts
are
more
and
more
willing
to
recognize
the
purposeful
discrimination
from
facts
and
circumstances.
it's
no
longer
a
situation
where
white
officials
bend
on
discrimination
would
get
on
the
stand
and
admit
that
they
discriminated.
i
think
there
is
the
type
of
situation
here
where
the
court
could
in
fact
find
that
there
was
such
a
purpose.
i
think
given
the
legislative
history
of
section
5,
i
think
congress
did
definitely
intend
to
set
up
a
different
standard
than
the
fifteenth
amendment.
and
under
that
standard,
they
might
well
be
in
individual
cases
say
a
redistricting
plan
which
would
not
be
acceptable
under
section
5
which
under
a
particular
constitutional
case
wouldn't
be
declared
unconstitutional.
and
this
has
to
be
characterized
a
couple
of
ways.
it
could
be
characterized
merely
as
an
inference
of
unconstitutional
gerrymandering
from
these
facts
and
circumstances
or
it
could
be
characterized
as
a
substantive
rule
but
in
any
effect,
i
think
it's
very
clear
after
this
court's
decision
in
south
carolina
versus
katzenbach
and
some
other
cases
that
it
is
quite
possible
that
section
5
will
prohibit
a
type
of
arrangement
that
might
not
otherwise
be
unconstitutional
on
individual
case.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
that's
what
congress
was
intending.
i
think
it
saw
that
there
was
discrimination
in
schools,
in
education,
in
jobs
and
so
on
in
voting,
going
back
down
and
the
reason
was
that
the
elected
officials
were
able
to
ignore
the
particular
interest
of
the
black
minority
and
by
appealing
to
bloc
voting
and
the
like
and
that
the
congress
intended
to
eliminate
this
by
preventing
the
division
for
instance
in
redistricting
plans
of
these
concentrations
of
black
voters
so
that
the
white
incumbents
or
politicians
in
power
couldn't
appeal
and
harness
bloc
voting
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
then
just
ignore
the
interest
of
blacks.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
there
is
a
history
which
goes
back
and
forth
but
prior
to
1954,
there
was
a
seven-member
commission
body
elected
from
districts
and
then
in
1954
the
plan
was
changed
and
there
were
two
at
large
members,
so
the
present
system
dates
from
1954.
so
there's
no
question
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
i
think
your
honor,
there's
a
--
i
think
there
were
some
at
large
seats
at
some
time
or
other
the
one
document
in
the
record
of
(inaudible)
in
new
orleans
trace
that
back
but
i
don't
recall.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
to
this
extent
your
honor,
the
plaintiffs
are
contending
that
the
district
court
shouldn't
consider
the
at
large
seats
in
examining
whether
the
five
districting
plan
were
racially
discriminatory.
we
think
that
this
is
frankly
nonsense.
we
think
this
court
indicating
united
states
versus
georgia
that
it's
a
matter
of
political
reality.
section
5
is
not
just
a
list
of
voting
type
changes.
i
think
the
court
was
not
only
could
but
was
bound
to
look
at
the
thing
the
way
it
operates
and
the
way
it
operates
is
that
you
had
two
seats
in
which
whites
would
certainly
be
elected
and
in
which
would
not
respond
to
the
black
community.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
in
fact,
the
--
in
regard
to
the
two
at
large
seats
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes
sir.
there's
no
question
but
i
think
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
i
think
the
change
is
though,
the
districting
arrangement
was
changed
your
honor
and
i
think
the
five
--
the
construction
of
the
five
districts
was
changed
and
so
therefore
the
district
court
in
examining
whether
or
not
the
arrangement
of
the
five
seats,
the
way
it
was
rearranged
was
racially
discriminatory
or
not
necessarily
would
have
to
look
at
other
factors
as
the
court
said,
a
backdrop
including
the
fact
that
the
two
at
large
seats
were
there.
now,
this
doesn't
mean
that
it's
precluded
under
any
kind
of
situation
from
having
two
at
large
seats.
there
may
be
--
the
district
court
just
found
that
the
combination
under
these
circumstances
that
the
two
arrangements
was
discriminatory.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
were
a
number
of
questions
posed
by
the
court
to
which
our
answer
is
a
bit
different
and
i
would
like
to
--
to
just
move
right
into
that.
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
it
is
our
position
that
the
section
5
standard
involved
here
is
considerably
more
stringent
than
the
standard
of
white
v.
regester
or
whitcomb
versus
chavis
and
that
the
inquiry,
the
proper
inquiry
of
a
court
under
section
5
is
considerable
more
limited.
specifically,
we
point
out,
of
course
as
we
have
in
our
brief,
that
congress
has
just
reenacted
section
5
for
an
additional
seven
years
with
a
specific
intention
to
have
the
act
cover
redistricting
for
the
1980
census.
congress
is
particularly
concerned
and
i
think
the
hearings
and
the
testimony
and
so
forth
indicate
that
it
is
particularly
concerned
that
in
these
areas
where
racial
discrimination
continues
to
be
practiced,
that
the
newly
enfranchised
black
voters
will
be
effectively
disenfranchised
by
a
line-drawing
districting
which
will
divide
up
black
concentrations
in
these
areas.
i
think
that,
specifically
this
was
the
matter
that
section
5
sought
to
remedy,
in
this
type
of
case,
a
line-drawing
redistricting
case
and
the
inquiry
should
be
a
narrow
one
and
that
is
whether
there
is
a
significant
concentration
of
black
voting
strength
and
whether
or
not
a
districting
plan
divides
up
that
population
and
spreads
it
out
into
predominantly
white
districts.
i
think
that
is
the
inquiry
and
i
think
that
is
exactly
what
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
you
have
significant
black
concentrations
of
populations
in
new
orleans.
in
spite
of
what
mr.
stoner
has
suggested,
you
can
walk
from
jefferson
parish
throughout
the
city
for
eight
or
ten
miles
to
the
st.
bernard
parish
line
and
not
see
a
white
face
along
that
band,
that
black
belt,
that
parallels
the
river
in
curved
fashion
throughout
the
city.
white
people
live
in
the
very
wealthy
sections
of
town
out
by
the
lake
and
along
st.
charles
avenue
to
the
river.
the
rest
is
left
over
for
blacks
and
these
are
heavy
concentrations,
and
that
plan
devised
by
the
city
council
slices
up
that
population
like
so
many
pieces
of
baloney
and
that
is
what
congress
intended
for
here.
now,
to
the
inquiry
as
to
how
do
you
compare
to
previous
plans
or
what
do
you
compare
to,
i
think
section
5
is
--
congress
is
very
explicit
that
there
is
one
triggering
device.
when
you
have
a
voting
change,
then
section
5
is
triggered,
is
brought
into
effect
and
then
the
inquiry
becomes
as
to
whether
or
not
the
matter
is
--
is
racially
discriminatory
or
not.
in
redistricting
cases,
particularly
because
you
have
operation
to
the
one
man-one
vote
mandate,
you
do
not
have
anything
to
go
back
to.
you
do
not
have
a
previous
plan
that
you
can
really
compare
to
like
you
do
in
an
annexation.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
no,
sir,
they
did
not.
they
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
if
--
if
you
disagree
with
them
on
effect,
i
think
the
only
appropriate
thing
would
be
to
have
the
court
of
appeals
considering
side
to
issue,
the
purpose
and
that
is
such
a
primarily
a
fact
question.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir,
a
three-judge
court.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
we
would
submit
that
the
city
council,
however,
was
under
a
mandate
when
the
first
plan,
plan
i
was
rejected
to
correct
the
defects
of
that
plan.
i
think
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
justice
department,
the
attorney
general,
in
that
instance
said
“the
thing
that
you
did
wrong
is
you
divided
up
black
population
concentrations,”
and
in
plan
ii
they
did
not
attempt
to
--
to
remedy
this,
but
rather
continued
the
division
and
i
think
this
was
the
fault
of
the
second
plan
as
well
as
the
first.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
no
sir,
of
course
there
are
always
many
plans
and
i
do
not
think
the
standard
is
that
this
was
the
only
feasible
plan.
i
think
where
feasibility
comes
in
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think
the
--
the
--
well,
i
think
where
feasibility
comes
in,
what
the
act
mandates
is
that
where
feasible,
these
lines
not
be
drawn
in
such
a
way
that
they
divide
up
the
black
community
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
glickstein
memorandum
said
was
the
meaning
of
section
5
which
senator
bai
indicated
was
the
proper
statement
of
what
the
committee
recommending
renewal
of
the
act
thought
the
act
to
mean
and
that
is
that
where
feasible,
a
plan
should
--
a
line
should
not
run
right
through
the
center
of
black
population
concentrations.
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
on
the
feasibility
issue
that
this
is
--
that
this
was
what
congress
meant
in
this
type
of
case.
the
standard
here
that
i
believe
is
quite
clear
that
congress
has
mandated
under
section
5
has
some
very
practical
feasible
effects
as
well.
some
standards
have
been
vaguely
suggested.
i
do
not
think
the
government
has
really
suggested
a
clear
standard
as
to
what
section
5.
mr.
stoner
has
suggested
just
a
general
rationality
standard
which
i
suggest
would
open
up
the
floodgates
to
all
sorts
of
rationalizations
to
justify
any
type
of
discriminatory
plan.
the
standard,
i
believe,
that
congress
provided,
when
feasible
not
dividing
black
population
communities
would
be
--
have
certain
administrative
advantages
in
that
the
court
would
not
have
to
make
the
in-depth
sort
of
inquiry,
as
was
done
in
white
versus
regester
and
so
on,
into
some
very
sticky
political
and
social
issues
as
to
whether
blacks
are
better
off
in
a
majority
or
a
minority
and
the
like,
but
rather
the
administration
would
rather
simply
would
also
provide
fairly
clear
guidelines
to
city
such
as
new
orleans
when
they
are
attempting
to
--
to
draw
a
plan
which
would
not
fall
afoul
of
section
5.
and,
it
of
course
also
leaves
this
area
properly,
i
think
in
congress’
hands.
congress
is
setting
up
a
limited
remedy
that
is
limited
in
time.
it
is
going
to
expire
in
1982
to
provide
for
this
particular
problem
that
it
found
to
exist
and
that
was
the
division
of
black
population
by
district
lines.
it
also
was
well
aware
that
this
was
the
way
the
attorney
general
had
been
applying
the
act
when
he
was
dealing
with
plans
submitted
to
him
which
involved
the
question
of
line
drawing
gerrymandering,
if
you
will.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
no,
sir.
our
contention
is
that
section
5
is
violated
when
lines
are
drawn
to
divide
up
black
population
concentrations.
they
other
side
of
that,
the
remedy
would
be
in
future
plans
not
to
so
divide
up
the
black
population
concentrations.
now,
that
is
going
to
have
certain
effects
which
to
some
extent
are
going
to
be
predictable.
for
instance,
in
new
orleans,
if
you
do
not
divide
up
those
black
concentrations,
you
are
likely
going
to
come
out
with
2
out
of
5
or
3
out
of
7
districts,
but
that
is
not
what
is
compelled.
that
is
just
what
is
in
reality
likely
to
happen.
we
do
not
think
it
is
maximization
and
besides
under
--
we
are
not
talking
about
giving
any
preference
at
all,
the
likely
result
would
--
would
merely
be
that
blacks
are
no
longer
entirely
excluded
from
being
majority
in
some
districts.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
no,
i
think
richmond
is
--
is
what
it
is,
some
are
just
facts
as
an
annexation
case
and
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
i
am
certainly
not
asking
this
court
to
rule
that
there
would
be
a
particular
number.
that
is
not
the
standard
that
we
are
asking
for.
we
are
asking
for
a
standard
that
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
i
think
that
standard
could
be
elucidated
more
clearly
as
a
clear
standard
in
these
kinds
of
cases
against
dividing
a
black
concentration
--
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
standard
that
we
are
suggesting
today?
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
going
to
be
on
at
all.
it
is
more
narrow,
i
think.
the
particular
facts
of
this
case
call
for
this
court
if
it
is
going
to
apply
this
standard
to
affirm
the
district
court’s
ruling.
if
this
was
in
a
violation
of
section
5,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
imagine
one
that
is
because
in
this
case,
the
black
populations
has
just
been
divided
and
divided
rather
consistently.
it
is
very
clear
that
there
is
a
strong
concentration
of
black
population
in
the
city
and
this
population
has
been
divided
up
among
many
majority
white
districts.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
over
the
1961
redistricting
plan?
no,
sir.
i
do
not
know
if
that
is
necessarily
relevant,
but
in
fact,
it
is
not
for
a
number
of
reasons
and
the
figures
in
the
tables
might
sort
of
lead
to
that
conclusion,
but
they
are
misleading
because
in
1961,
only
17%
of
the
registered
voters
of
new
orleans
were
black.
in
1972,
when
we
were
--
we
were
in
district
court,
something
like
38%
of
the
registered
voters
in
the
town
are
black.
so,
it
does
not
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference
perhaps
in
1961
as
to
what
happens
because
blacks
simply
were
not
allowed
to
register
and
vote,
but
it
does
make
a
difference
now
that
because
of
the
operation
of
other
provisions
of
the
voting
rights
act,
blacks
have
been
allowed
to
register
and
vote
in
significant
numbers
and
now
they
are
divided
up
so
that
they
are
--
they
are
still
cut
off
from
the
political
process
and
they
still
have
no
effective
voice
in
what
city
does.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
in
1961,
your
honor,
only
17%
of
the
electorate
was
black.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
in
1961?
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
there
is
indeed
evidence
that
they
were
prevented
from
registering
and
voting
by
literacy
test,
the
other
devices
in
the
registrar’s
office.
there
were
many
suits.
only
evidence
in
this
court
shows
that
only
after
the
effect
of
1965
voting
rights
act
was
there
a
demonstrable
increase
in
black
registration.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
think
that
is
the
conclusion.
i
do
not
think
that
is
going
to
happen
very
often.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
assuming
that
there
was
no
requirement
to
redistrict
they
could
do
that,
but
that
is
seldom
a
case
and
it
was
not
the
case
in
this
instance.
in
fact,
the
district
court
of
louisiana
has
held
that
in
fact
they
were
malapportioned
in
violative
of
one
man-one
vote
standard
as
is
enjoined
them
from
continuing
that
point.
so,
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
well,
good
intentions
are
half-bound
your
honor.
there
may
well
be
good
intentions,
but
if
intentions
are
--
are
in
dealing
with
such
things,
but
even
if
the
city
council
would
--
would
be
in
good
intention
that
the
effect
is
bad,
it
violates
the
act
because
that
is
a
given
of
what
the
act
says.
mr.
stanley
a.
halpin,
jr.
even
if
it
was
in
fact
an
improvement,
but
i
--
i
do
not
concede
that
that
will
ever
really
happen,
your
honor.
of
course,
re-adaption
of
the
old
districting
would
amount
to
another
change
under
section
5
like
in
georgia
versus
united
states.
i
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
we
hold
that.
thank
you.
