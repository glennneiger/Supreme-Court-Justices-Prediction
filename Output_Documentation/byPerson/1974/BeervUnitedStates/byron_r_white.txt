justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
you
necessarily
win
your
declaratory
judgment
action
if
it
were
found
that
under
the
constitution,
the
plan
was
acceptable
or
do
you
to
put
it
in
another
way,
do
you
think
the
statute
had
something
beyond
what
the
constitution
would
require
in
terms
of
what
you
have
to
prove
when
you
are
making
a
change
covered
by
section
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
a
voting.
i
take
it,
you
say
this
is
a
voting
case,
fifteenth
amendment
voting
case
rather
than
a
--
rather
than
an
equal
protection
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
reinforcement
cases
are
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
their
equal
protection
considerations
were
solved
them,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
are
we
talking
here
about
a
constitutional
standard
under
section
5
or
something
that's
imposed
by
section
5?
it
says
that
--
it
speaks
about
depriving
people
of
a
vote
by
a
reason
of
race
or
color,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you,
using
the
same
--
operating
in
the
statement
that
is
subject
section
5,
the
plan
like
(inaudible)
state
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
form
it
was
written.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
we
cannot
solve
thing
as
compared
to
what
it
used
to
be
or
is
it
compared
to
what
it
could
be
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
negroes,
except
the
charged
negroes,
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
register
to
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
purport
it
had
a
purpose
or
effect
to
denying
anybody
the
right
to
vote.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
how
was
the
dilution
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only,
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
there's
only
fact
changed
in
a
new
plan
namely
that
the
districts
have
withdrawn
so
that
we'll
only
have
three
representatives,
would
you
still
have
to
go
through
along
ignoring
about
it
or
would
that
satisfy
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
--
wouldn't
you
think
that
reading
its
opinion,
considering
the
judge's,
do
you
take
if
you're
going
to
redistrict
a
city
like
new
orleans
or
a
state
and
you
know
you're
going
to
have
to
get
by
mr.
wallace
and
his
colleagues
in
the
attorney
general's
office
that
you
really
are
to
take
race
into
account
in
drawing
your
district
lines?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
still
easy,
very
easily
draw
them
without
taking
race
into
account.
the
only
trouble
is
that
happens
to
end
up
that
like
in
this
case,
it
will
be
only
the
have
the
purpose
and
effect
of
denying
the
right
to
vote.
now,
how
can
you
get
around
this
judgment
without
saying
affirmatively
take
race
into
account
in
drawing
your
district
lines.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
you
should?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree,
afterwards,
you're
going
to
take
race
into
account
but
when
you're
drawing
your
districts,
you
really
should,
i
take
it
that
the
attorney
general
thinks,
gerrymander
on
the
basis
of
race
to
ensure
that
the
minority
group
in
the
community
has
a
fair
percentage
and
a
fair
representation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
just
a
bad
word
then
to
take
race
into
account
and
draw
your
districts
so
that
the
racial
minority
will
have
a
fair
representation
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
are
you
backing
away
from
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
is
or
you
didn't
take
that
into
account?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
don't
gerrymander,
you
end
up
with
a
pattern
like
as
in
this
case,
you're
going
to
be
in
trouble
with
the
attorney
general.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you're
proving
my
point.
you
really
ought
to
take
race
into
account
in
going
--
justice
byron
r.
white
this
case
had
come
up
in
a
state
not
covered
by
section
5
and
it
had
just
been
arose
as
an
ordinary
reapportionment
suit
by
citizen
claiming
that
it
was
discriminatory
that
the
case
would
come
up
the
same
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
cited
white
against
regester,
that's
just
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
said
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
have
though.
you
said
it
satisfies
white
against
regester
and
hence
it's
constitutional
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
suggestion
is
--
are
you
suggesting
this
that
the
city
in
redistricting
itself
should
avoid
dividing
up
with
black
voting
strength?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
cares
to
drawing
your
lines
as
to
what
it
does
to
the
minorities
living
in
a
particular
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
suggest
yes.
you
should
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
for
sure
i
think
because
it
wouldn't
even
reserve
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
suggesting
that
the
way
you
want
me
to
look
at
it
is
sort
of
a
remedy
to
a
historic
practices?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
620?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
general,
as
long
as
the
change
does
not
--
does
not
involve
some
harm
to
the
black
voters
as
compared
to
what
it
was
before
that
the
attorney
general
has
no
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
--
suppose
someone
says
to
you,
“well
look,
this
plan
is
a
--
may
be
bad,
but
it
is
no
worse
than
the
prior
plan.
we
did
not
hurt
anybody
as
compared
to
the
prior
plan.
there
is
no
change
in
that
regard.”
does
section
5
apply
still?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
do
not
understand
why
you
say
two
at
large
seats
are
not
implicated
in
this
place
or
not
reached
by
section
5?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
richmond
case
have
any
relevance
to
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
confine
richmond
to
annexation
and
not
providing
some
general
standard
as
to
--
under
section
--
for
section
5
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
think,
then,
you
would
have
quite
a
different
case
because
they
would
be
representing
different
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
resolve
the
purpose
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
solely
on
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
disagreed
with
them
on
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
re
--
i
mean,
it
is
a
three-judge
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
sorry.
