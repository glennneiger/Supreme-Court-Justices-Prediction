mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
may
1973,
in
georgia
against
the
united
states,
this
court
agreed
with
our
longstanding
interpretation
that
the
voting
rights
act
does
apply
to
reapportionments
and
redistrictings
and
this
is
the
first
case
in
this
court
which
raises
the
question
of
what
the
act
means
with
respect
to
these
redistrictings.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
in
so
far
as
the
act's
procedures
are
concerned.
i
don't
understand
connor
against
johnson
to
hold
that
a
court
in
adopting
a
redistricting
plan
in
a
jurisdiction
covered
by
the
act
should
not
take
the
substantive
standards
of
the
act
into
account.
i
thought
it
holds
that
the
act's
other
procedures
are
not
to
be
applied
in
such
a
situation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
thought
it
was
in
the
context
of
whether
it
has
to
be
approved
by
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
addressed
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
a
district
court
taking
the
substantive
standards
of
the
act
into
account
and
i
think
there's
a
strong
argument
to
be
made
that
congress
meant
those
substantive
standards
to
have
effect
in
the
jurisdictions
covered
by
whatever
procedure
may
be
the
appropriate
one
in
the
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
there's
a
strong
argument
and
it
was
the
position
we
took
in
the
hearings
that
the
act
goes
beyond.
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
that
in
this
case
but
we
did
take
that
position
before
a
congress
when
it
reenacted
the
statute
in
1970
that
section
5
imposes
prophylactic
substantive
requirements
beyond
just
the
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
which
is
a
major
factor
in
your
substantive
result
in
addition
and
we
stand
by
that
in
our
administration
of
the
act.
it
was
not
so
clear
that
the
fifteenth
amendment
without
this
act
would
prohibit
a
change
in
voting
procedures
merely
because
it
had
the
effect
of
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race.
it
depends
on
how
you
want
to
interprete
the
right
to
vote
on
count
of
race.
but
the
act
has
been
interpreted
to
mean
dilution.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
i
just
said,
the
act
has
been
interpreted
to
mean
dilution
and
this
was
the
language
used
by
this
court
in
both
perkins
against
matthews
and
in
the
georgia
case.
well,
this
is
what
both
we
and
the
district
court
had
to
determine
in
looking
at
the
plans
that
were
submitted.
first,
the
so-called
plan
i
and
then
plan
ii
which
was
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
reviewing
these
plans
and
the
bulk
of
them
have
been
reviewed
administratively
rather
than
in
the
courts,
we
start
off
with
the
premise
that
the
question
before
us
is
not
a
comparison
of
the
present
abridgement
with
the
preexisting
abridgement
but
that
the
act
was
enacted
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
that
can
be
accomplished
only
by
looking
at
how
the
new
procedure
will
operate
and
see
what
effect
it
will
have
on
minority
voting
strength
and
whether
it
denies
on
account
of
race
or
color
and
equal
opportunity
for
meaningful
participation
in
the
electoral
process
for
standards
that
were
quite
painstakingly
developed
by
this
court
in
whitcomb
and
white
against
regester.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
would
be
no
point
in
having
the
act
apply
to
reapportionments
if
that
were
the
only
question
because
all
the
reapportionments
under
the
reynolds
against
simms
in
its
progeny
have
to
result
in
fairly
equal
districts
in
which
everyone
will
have
an
equal
ballot
from
that
standpoint.
the
question
is
what
practical
effect
will
that
have,
what
possibilities
of
racial
gerrymandering
is
the
act
designed
to
protect
against
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
this
case,
it
was
diluted
by
looking
at
all
the
circumstances
of
the
apportionment
that
was
involved
here
and
there's
no
short
answer
to
these
questions
on
our
experience
because
in
addition
to
the
premise
that
you
look
at
the
whole
effect,
we
also
started
off
with
the
premise
that
the
act
does
not
choose
between
different
theories
of
political
representation.
there's
nothing
per
se
invalid
under
the
act
with
having
two
at
large
and
five
district
councilmen.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
way
we
have
been
administering
the
act
is
we
not
only
look
at
the
face
of
the
submission
that
we
notify
interested
persons
who
have
registered
with
us
of
what
has
been
submitted.
this
includes
civil
rights
organizations
and
individuals
in
the
community
at
issue
who
have
registered
with
us
and
we
see
what
they
have
to
say
about
what
the
effect
will
be
and
then
we
often
ask
the
submitting
jurisdiction
what
they
have
to
say
in
response.
it
isn't
easy
to
ascertain
whether
within
the
terms
of
the
statute,
a
new
procedure
will
have
the
effect
of
abridging
minority
voting
strength
or
minority
voting
rights
just
on
the
face
of
the
submission.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
--
neither
one,
your
honor
and
as
i
understand
it
the
court
didn't
use
either
of
those
criteria
but
used
something
in
between
comparison
with
the
percentage
of
that
group
in
the
community
as
a
whole
as
the
starting
point
and
those
figures
are
given
in
our
brief
in
a
little
chart
on
page
7.
that's
where
we
started
off
looking
at
this
district
and
the
district
court
did
the
same
thing
and
it
showed
that
in
the
1970
census,
45%
of
this
community
was
black.
the
percentage
of
registered
voters
that
were
black
was
34.5%,
a
little
over
one-third
and
the
black
population
of
voting
age
would
fall
somewhere
in
between
and
then
we
looked
at
the
districts
that
were
drawn
in
the
context
of
what
they
were
drawn
up
for
which
was
to
apportion
five
district
seats
of
a
seven-member
council
and
the
court
found
and
we
think
that
this
was
well
supported
by
the
evidence
that
the
two
at
large
members
of
that
council
because
of
a
background,
a
pattern
of
racial
bloc
voting
and
voting
procedures
that
were
in
effect
including
a
majority
vote
requirement
numbered
post
anti-single
shot
provisions
with
the
racial
polarization
and
bloc
voting
that
those
two
at
large
seats
would
be
controlled
by
a
white
bloc
vote.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
never
challenged
them,
we're
just
--
we're
saying
you
assess
the
five
districts
in
the
context
of
what
the
city
was
being
districted
for
and
that
was
five
representatives
on
a
seven-member
council,
two
members
of
which
are
controlled
by
the
white
voters
of
the
outset,
so
you
look
at
the
other
five
and
see
whether
the
districting
has
denied
the
minority
of
fair
opportunity
for
meaningful
representation
on
that
council.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
district
court
said
that
the
at
large
seats
are
themselves
invalid
but
it
didn't
have
to
say
that.
the
question
before
the
district
court
was
whether
to
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
approving
the
new
plan
and
it
already
given
several
quite
independently
sufficient
reasons
why
the
declaratory
judgment
should
be
denied
so
that
that
was
an
addendum
to
the
opinion
which
was
not
something
we
were
contending
for
and
was
unnecessary
to
the
result.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
we're
asking
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed,
that
the
district
court
was
right
in
denying
that
the
declaratory
judgment
but
we
have
found
no
reason
in
anything
that's
been
brought
to
our
attention
in
this
case
to
oppose
the
two
at
large
seats
and
we
have
some
doubt
about
whether
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
some
doubt
about
that.
the
intervenors
contend
that
it
is.
we
think,
we
never
have
challenged
it
in
this
case
and
if
there's
no
need
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
did
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
an
additional
ground
given
for
denying
the
declaratory
judgment
but
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
other
grounds
who
were
sufficient
then
solves
in
the
view
of
the
district
court
and
we
urge
that
there
were
other
grounds
for
denying
the
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there's
no
way
to
draw
them
without
taking
race
into
account
to
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
affirmatively,
we
don't
say
affirmatively
take
it
into
account.
obviously,
if
race
is
now
taken
into
account
at
all,
you
can
be
assured
that
your
new
procedure
will
not
have
the
purpose
of
abridging
voting
rights
on
account
of
race
but
how
will
you
know
whether
it
has
the
affect
unless
you
look
to
see
what
effect
it
will
have.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
a
fair
opportunity,
a
fair
opportunity
to
participate
meaningfully.
it
doesn't
mean
racial
gerrymandering.
we
don't
say
that
the
act
adopted
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
depends
on
the
political
circumstances
in
the
community.
we
don't
say
that
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
we
don't
think
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
say
it
has
to
be
taken
into
account,
yes,
but
we
don't
say
you
have
to
gerrymander
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
no,
no
because
the
act
doesn't
choose
between
theories
of
representation
in
our
view.
the
act
doesn't
choose
between
theories
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh
yes
because
in
this
case,
there
is
a
prevalent
practice
of
racial
bloc
voting
along
with
findings
that
the
city
council
members
are
not
responsive
to
the
needs
of
the
black
community.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
to
see
whether
your
new
procedure
will
have
the
effect
of
denying
the
minority
meaningful
participation
in
the
political
process.
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
we
don't.
we
don't
presume
bloc
voting
and
we
don't
think
the
act
is
intended
to
be
anything
comparable
to
the
statute
struck
down
in
anderson
against
martin.
we
don't
want
to
turn
the
act
into
something
like
that.
but
we
have
here
a
situation
in
which
this
was
the
reality,
bloc
voting
is
occurring
and
partly
nurtured
by
the
statute
struck
down
in
anderson
against
martin
which
required
racial
identification
on
the
ballots
and
you
got
findings
here
that
the
black
votes
will
in
effect
be
wasted
except
in
districts
in
which
the
blacks
are
in
a
majority.
you've
got
a
special
situation
here
which
has
to
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
the
purposes
of
the
act
are
met
and
you
combined
that
with
a
look
at
these
districts
which
are
drawn
as
long
north-south
slivers
rather
than
compact
districts
and
it's
quite
apparent
that
while
they
may
have
made
a
great
deal
offense
at
the
time
when
the
black
voters
across
the
middle
of
the
city
weren't
registered
and
weren't
voting
and
you
didn't
want
to
have
a
large
district
in
the
middle
with
just
a
handful
of
white
voters
controlling
one
councilman,
this
pattern
has
now
been
perpetuated
in
a
way
that
fragments
the
black
vote,
submerges
the
bulk
of
it
into
majority
white
districts
against
the
background
of
a
situation
in
which
there
are
findings
supported
by
the
evidence
of
the
pattern
of
racial
bloc
voting
and
of
unresponsiveness
to
the
needs
of
the
black
community
by
persons
elected
through
this
racial
bloc
voting.
that
seems
to
us
to
meet
the
standards
of
white
against
regester.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oh!
well,
i
think
it
would
be
quite
different.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
citing
it
as
an
a
fortiori
holding.
it
was
a
constitutional
case
in
which
detailed
findings
were
made
and
this
very
well
could
be
a
constitutional
violation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
in
this
situation
but
it
wasn't
necessary
for
the
district
court
to
go
there
at
far
and
we
didn't
have
to
contend
that
much.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
factors
--
i
think
that
a
strong
argument
could
be
made
to
that
effect.
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
that.
it's
unnecessary
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
factors
--
the
factors
that
were
upheld
by
this
court
is
sufficient
to
find
the
constitutional
violation
of
white
against
regester
are
very
comparable
to
the
factors
in
which
the
district
court
relied
here.
in
addition
to
extraneous
factors
that
weren't
necessary
to
the
result
in
our
view
and
that's
the
situation,
the
findings
are
detailed
in
our
opinion,
in
the
court's
opinion
and
are
recounted
in
the
briefs.
our
position
is
that
the
district
court
did
reach
the
correct
judgment
against
the
background
here.
we
have
spelled
out
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
why
the
guidelines
used
by
the
city
to
justify
this
particular
reapportionment
either
were
not
consistently
applied
or
could
be
satisfied
equally
well
by
a
plan
which
would
not
have
the
same
diluted
effects,
the
same
fragmenting
of
the
black
vote
in
this
situation
and
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
affirmed
perhaps
with
some
clarification
about
the
at
large
situation
here
since
when
a
new
plan
is
submitted,
if
a
new
plan
is
submitted
to
the
attorney
general,
we
would
feel
that
an
interpretation
of
the
act
by
a
court
with
respect
to
the
at
large
seats
would
be
something
we
should
honor.
if
the
opinion
can
be
read
as
saying
that
regardless
of
what
is
done
with
the
districts,
the
two
at
large
seats
would
have
to
be
rejected
in
this
case
which
is
not
the
position
we
have
taken.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
see
the
case,
it
presents
two
issues
for
review
here.
the
first
is
a
very
narrow
issue,
addressed
in
our
supplemental
brief,
and
that
is
whether
the
continued
existence
of
the
two
at
large
seats
was
a
matter
requiring
pre-clearance
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
as
we
explained
in
our
supplemental
brief,
we
take
a
generous
view
of
what
constitutes
the
change
that
requires
review
under
section
5,
but
we
do
not
--
we
do
not
take
a
view
that
stretches
this
far
because
there
is
no
reconsideration
or
re-adaption
of
the
two
at
large
seats
and
their
status
in
voting
strength
on
the
city
council,
on
the
seven-member
council,
remains
unchanged.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
not
our
standard,
mr.
justice.
that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
question
going
to
the
merits
once
section
5
applies
and
it
is
also
not
our
approach
to
the
merits.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
there
is
a
change
in
the
procedure,
if
there
is
a
redistricting,
section
5
applies
and
we
think
that
is
an
erroneous
substantive
standard
under
section
5
which
i
will
--
i
will
get
to
in
a
moment
on
the
other
aspect
of
the
case.
we
think
the
question
of
the
two
at
large
seats
is
an
extremely
narrow
one
here.
it
was
a
question
which
was
not
necessary
to
the
district
court’s
judgment,
but
on
reflection
in
this
case,
we
think
that
this
court
does
have
to
say
something
addressed
to
it
because
otherwise
it
will
govern
what
future
plans
can
be
cleared
by
the
attorney
general
upon
submission
by
new
orleans.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
do
not
think
that
was
based
on
any
provision
of
the
act
specifically.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
was
the
district
court’s
approach
to
attempting
to
assess
whether
the
plan
has
the
purpose
or
would
have
the
effect
of
abridging
the
right
to
vote,
and
one
way
to
answer
that
is
to
look
to
the
concerns
that
the
city
had
in
adapting
its
districting
and
see
whether
those
concerns
could
have
been
met
without
the
dilution
of
minority
voting
strength
that
resulted
from
the
plan
proposed.
and
in
this
case,
i
think
the
court
quite
probably
looked
to
the
alternatives
that
were
reflected
in
the
record
to
show
that
the
city’s
general
objectives
could
be
as
well
complied
with
without
the
effect
on
minority
voting
strength
that
occurred
here.
and,
that
brings
me
to
the
principal
issue
in
the
case,
the
one
discussed
in
our
principal
brief,
and
on
that
our
starting
point
is
the
court’s
decision
in
georgia
against
the
united
states
holding
that
the
act
does
protect
against
dilution
of
minority
voting
strength
through
redistricting
and
by
dilution,
and
there
is
some
confusion
in
the
testimony
about
this.
we
do
not
believe
“by
dilution”
we
mean
a
comparison
with
how
the
minority
voters
were
treated
under
the
preceding
redistricting.
we
do
not
think
either
the
attorney
general
or
the
district
courts
are
in
the
business
under
this
act
of
measuring
comparative
abridgments
of
the
right
to
vote.
the
act
was
designed
to
enforce
the
provisions
of
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
the
proper
inquiry
is
whether
there
has
been
a
reduction
of
voting
strength
in
comparison
with
the
way
other
members
of
the
society
are
treated.
i
do
not
think
we
could
articulate
it
differently
for
purposes
of
section
5
and
this
court
articulated
it
in
white
against
regester
and
whitcomb
against
chavis
in
a
quotation
which
appears
on
page
15
of
our
principal
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
the
effect
or
the
purpose
is
to
deny
or
abridge
the
right
to
vote
on
the
basis
of
grace,
there
is
a
statutory
violation,
even
though
it
is
not
as
bad
an
abridgment
as
it
was
before.
that
has
always
been
our
reading
of
the
act
and
our
administration
of
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
a
difference
in
the
burden
of
proof
under
the
act
and
--
and
i
would
say,
yes,
substantively
as
well
on
the
basis
of
the
prophylactic
intent
expressed
in
the
--
in
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
view
of
the
act
because
the
act
was
designed
to
enforce
the
fifteenth
amendment,
and
when
someone
submits
a
proposal
to
--
to
us
under
the
act,
we
have
to
see
whether
it
meets
that
statutory
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
may
be
that
they
--
that
they
can
show
that
the
purpose
was
not
to
deny
or
abridge
the
right
to
vote,
but
they
also
have
to
show
that
the
effect
is
not
to
abridge
or
deny
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
not
think
it
is
as
compared
with
the
previous
plan
because
that
would
put
us
and
the
district
court
here
in
the
position
of
--
of
approving,
under
the
act,
plans
that
do
not
meet
even
the
substantive
standards
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
then
would
be
subject
to
a
suit
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
where
the
act
was
designed
to
have
exactly
the
opposite
effect,
a
prophylactic
effect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
--
if
they
were
reconsidered
or
re-adapted
in
any
way,
we
would
have
said
that
they
were
a
change,
but
they
have
existed
in
the
same
status
since
1954
under
a
city
charter
which
does
not
provide
for
their
re-adaption
or
reconsideration.
if
the
charter
provides
a
separate
provision
that
the
five
districts
seats
should
be
redistricted
and
that
redistricting
does
not
affect
the
status
of
the
two
at
large
seats
on
the
seven-member
council
or
the
voting
strength
of
the
two
at
large
seats,
there
has
been
no
reconsideration
or
re-adaption
of
the
two
at
large
seats
since
the
effect
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
only
marginally,
mr.
justice,
because
the
annexation
problem
is
a
somewhat
different
one
under
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
general
standard
that
has
been
adapted
in
the
allen
case
and
all
the
subsequent
cases
as
it
applies
in
particular
to
the
annexation
context.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
the
at
large
seats
would
have
a
different
electorate
and
i
am
quite
sure
we
would
take
the
position
that
here
would
be
a
change
with
respect
to
them,
but
here
they
have
the
same
electorate.
otherwise,
there
is
a
change
every
time
someone
dies
and
someone
becomes
21
years
old,
but
we
do
not
interpret
change
in
that
fashion,
or
18
years
old.
i
am
a
little
out
of
date
on
that.
the
question,
it
seems
to
us,
and
the
question
resolved
correctly
by
the
district
court
is
whether
the
standards
adapted
by
this
court
and
developed
by
this
court
in
the
context
of
multi-member
districts
in
white
v.
regester
and
whitcomb
v.
chavis,
also
apply
to
single-member
districts.
and,
i
am
talking
about
the
standard
that
we
have
quoted
on
page
15
of
our
brief
that
the
political
process
is
not
leading
to
nomination
and
election.
we
are
not
evenly
open
to
participation
by
the
group
in
question
that
its
members
had
less
opportunity
than
did
other
residents
in
the
district
to
participate
in
the
political
process
and
to
elect
legislators
of
their
choice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
but
if
--
if
anything,
the
fifteenth
amendment
would
be
a
fortiori
case
for
protecting
the
voting
strength
of
the
minority
voters
affected.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
a
statutory
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
wholly
a
statutory
issue,
but
as
we
argue,
the
statute
implicates
constitutional
standards
because
it
was
designed
to
enforce
the
guarantee
of
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
might,
although
that
would
be
a
quite
extreme
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
do
not
remember
the
previous
plan
had
been
valid.
i
did
not
remember
that
as
being
part
of
the
hypothetical,
but
i
agree
with
it,
but
i
think
it
would
be
an
extreme
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
could
happen.
it
might
be
merely
for
failure
of
proof
in
the
--
in
the
section
5
proceeding,
but
it
could
happen.
i
think
that
is
unlikely
and
that
is
not
what
the
administration
of
the
act
is
generally
involved.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
not
and
let
me
try
to
explain
why
in
a
minute
or
two.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
--
we
were
never
asked
to
express
a
view
on
that,
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
it
was
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
in
terms
of
what
we
would
approve
for
pre-clearance
purposes
under
section
5.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
but
the
original
plan
was
not,
but
it
had
been
submitted
to
us
a
change
from
there
to
preexisting
plan,
it
would
have
gotten
the
same
reaction
that
plan
i
and
plan
ii
did.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
let
me
try
to
say
something
which
is
that
we
think
the
standard
for
multi-member
districts
developed
in
these
cases
has
to
be
the
same
standard
that
applies
to
single-member
districts
and
we
would
illustrate
that
with
a
hypothetical
that
if,
for
example,
new
orleans
were
changed
to
a
city
council
with
seven
members,
all
elected
at
large,
that
obviously
would
satisfy
fourteenth
amendment
standards
and
yet
there
would
be
a
substantial
basis
saying
that
the
standards
of
white
against
regester
could
be
shown
to
have
been
violated
by
such
a
districting
and
yet,
it
seems
to
us
the
result
would
be
the
same
that
instead
of
the
seven
at
large
members,
the
city
would
divide
it
into
seven
districts
so
drawn
and
this
would
be
theoretically
possible
although
difficult,
that
each
district
contains
exactly
the
same
proportion
of
black
and
white
voters
as
the
city
at
large,
roughly
35%
black
and
65%
white.
it
--
it
seems
to
us
that
you
would
have
the
same
result
in
terms
of
dilution
of
minority
voting
strength
which
is
what
we
read
the
white
and
whitcomb
cases
to
involve
a
standard
for
determining
what
constitutes
dilution
of
minority
voting
strength
that
is
to
provide
the
guidance
for
assessing
plans
submitted
under
section
5
of
the
act.
now,
what
was
done
here
was
nothing
quite
so
crude
as
to
draw
the
districts
in
a
way
that
each
one
would
reflect
exactly
the
proportion
of
voting
strength
of
the
minority
group
in
the
city
as
a
whole,
but
it
approaches
that
because
as
you
will
notice
in
studying
the
plan
and
i
am
sorry
my
time
is
expiring
here,
in
each
of
the
districts
except
one,
the
blacks
are
merged
into
a
district
in
which
a
majority
of
whites
has
been
put
into
the
district
by
extending
the
district
in
several
cases
from
lake
pontchartrain
to
the
southern
extremity
of
the
city.
this
was
done
to
perpetuate
a
system
of
districting
of
the
city
which
may
have
been
quite
understandable
at
a
time
when
the
blacks
spread
throughout
the
middle
of
the
city
were
not
voting,
were
not
registered,
were
not
being
allowed
to
register
to
vote
and
it
was
necessary
to
have
some
voters
in
each
district.
so,
the
districts
were
elongated
in
that
fashion,
but
it
seems
to
us,
as
it
did
to
the
district
court,
inappropriate
to
attempt
to
perpetuate
it
in
the
present
context
in
light
of
the
particular
findings
of
the
district
court
which
we
elaborate
in
our
brief,
involving
a
prevalent
pattern
of
block
voting,
difficulties
in
getting
responsiveness
from
the
city
council
to
the
needs
of
the
black
community,
whether
those
problems
involve
employment
in
the
city
government,
adequate
park
streets,
recreational
facilities
in
the
black
neighborhoods,
etcetera.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
the
voting
age
population
is
more
relevant.
we
had
to
extrapolate
it
from
census
figures
because
it
was
not
in
--
in
the
record.
it
was
not
dealt
with
in
the
district
court
or
in
the
submission
of
these
districting
plans
and
there
is
a
considerable
difference.
it
comes
out
about
halfway
between
the
percentage
of
registered
voters
and
the
percentage
of
total
population.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
you
apply
it
to
the
five
seats?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
we
think
that
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
you
are
districting
for
five
members
of
a
seven-member
council
and
that
two
members
are
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
you
--
you
look
at
--
you
look
at
the
five
districts
for
the
purpose
for
which
they
are
being
districted
and
that
is
to
elect
five
members
of
a
seven-member
council
as
to
which
the
findings
are
two
members
are
already
the
expectancy
of
the
white
vote.
you
have
to
look
at
the
political
situation
realistically,
that
is
the
teaching
of
all
the
section
5
cases.
i
believe
my
time
has
expired.
