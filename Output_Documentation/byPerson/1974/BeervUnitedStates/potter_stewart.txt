the
city
could
have
done
the
same
thing
earlier
after
the
expression
by
the
attorney
general
of
disapproval
plan
i.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
in
the
record
why
it
didn't
go
to
court
and
seek
approval?
justice
potter
stewart
right
after
the
attorney
general
actually
formulated
a
plan
to
submit
it
back
to
the
attorney
general.
justice
potter
stewart
he
disapproved
that
and
the
city
went
to
court
and
that's
the
case
we
now
have.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not

justice
potter
stewart
621.
justice
potter
stewart
what
it
is
now
are
facts
that
are
still
on
effect
because
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
except
the
matter
here
though
that
all
the
incumbent
councilmen
were,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
plan
ii
which
i
understand
it
is
on
page
624
and
that's
the
plan
before
us,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
the
five
districts
four
of
those
also
are
on
the
lake
pontchartrain,
don't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
all
but
b?
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
plan
ii
the
least
of
these
districts
a,
b,
c,
d
and
e
as
you
suggested
just
a
moment
ago,
take
in
a
pretty
broad
spectrum
of
economic
and
social
groups?
justice
potter
stewart
each
one
of
them.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
downtown
section.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that
your
adversary
is
here
today
disagree
with
you
about
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
their
briefs.
justice
potter
stewart
very
well.
here
from
i
might
touch
in
their
briefs,
they
didn't
seem
to
differ
much
about
that
aspect
of
your
case.
justice
potter
stewart
under
new
orleans
charter
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
mandatory
under
your
charter.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
do
not
support
it
here,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
my
brother
rehnquist
says
it's
not
--
they're
not
even
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
although
the
district
court
did
in
its
opinion
reach
it.
justice
potter
stewart
and
to
the
extent
it
did,
it's
a
component,
it's
one
of
the
foundations
of
its
opinion,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
in
what
year?
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
four-year
terms,
are
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
just
as
they
had
a
grandfather
clause
enacted
by
this
council?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
deiced
--
that
language
is
in
the
context
of
a
fourteenth
amendment
issue
and
here
we
have
a
statutory
issue
which
is
related
to
any
part
of
the
constitution
to
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
the
issue
here
is
a
statutory
issue,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
wholly?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
told
us
and
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong
in
my
understanding,
mr.
wallace,
that
even
though
the
previous
plan
would
have
been
valid
as
against
either
a
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendment
attack
and
even
though
the
change
is
an
improvement,
vis-a-vis,
giving
minority
races
an
opportunity
to
vote,
nonetheless
it
might
violate
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
broadly
what
your
telling
us
is
directed
to
attacking
the
presumption
or
the
hypothesis
a
premise
of
the
district
court
that
voters
of
new
orleans’
vote
as
a
black
racially?
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
are
say
that
is
--
experience
shows
that
is
fallacious?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
prohibits
a
state
or
any
of
its
political
subdivisions
which
are
subject
to
section
4
of
the
act
from
enforcing,
and
i
quote
the
statutory
language,
“any
voting
qualification
or
prerequisite
to
voting
or
standard,
practice
or
procedure
with
respect
to
voting
different
from
that
in
force
or
effect
on
november
1,
1964,”
unless
it
has
obtained
a
declaratory
judgment
from
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
that
such
change,
again
the
statutory
language,
“does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color”
or
has
submitted
the
proposed
change
to
the
attorney
general,
and
the
attorney
general
has
not
objected
to
it.
the
constitutionality
of
this
procedure
was
upheld
soon
after
the
enactment
of
statute
in
the
case
of
south
carolina
against
katzenbach
reported
at
volume
383
of
the
united
states
reports.
and
it
is
now
well-established
through
at
least
two
of
our
decisions
that
section
5
is
applicable
when
a
state
or
political
subdivision
adopts
a
legislative
reapportionment
plan.
the
city
of
new
orleans
brought
this
suit
under
section
5,
seeking
a
judgment,
declaring
that
a
reapportionment
of
new
orleans'
councilmanic
districts
did
not
have
the
purpose
or
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
to
vote
account
of
race
or
color.
the
district
court
entered
a
judgment
of
dismissal,
holding
that
the
new
reapportionment
plan
would
have
the
effect
of
abridging
the
voting
rights
of
new
orleans’
negro
citizens.
the
city
appealed
the
judgment
to
this
court,
claiming
that
the
district
court
had
used
an
incorrect
standard
in
assessing
the
effect
of
the
reapportionment
in
this
section
5
suit,
and
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
it
is
undisputed
that
the
reapportionment
plan
in
question,
adopted
in
1971,
will
have
the
effect
of
substantially
improving
the
position
of
negro
citizens
in
new
orleans
with
respect
to
their
effective
exercise
of
the
electoral
franchise.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
some
detail
in
the
court’s
written
opinion,
we
hold
that
an
ameliorative
new
legislative
apportionment,
such
as
this,
can
not
violate
section
5
unless
the
new
apportionment
itself
so
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
race
or
color
as
to
violate
the
constitution,
and
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
this
reapportionment
is
unconstitutional.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
set
aside
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
written
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined
and
mr.
justice
stevens
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
