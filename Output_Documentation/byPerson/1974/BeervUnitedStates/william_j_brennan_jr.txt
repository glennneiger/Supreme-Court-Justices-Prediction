justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
1961,
you
did
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
it
that
those
two
parts,
aren't
they
elect
one
councilman,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
it's
that
double
purpose
the
burden
of
which
you
are
willing
to
assume.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
assume
the
burden
of
proof,
yes,
purpose
and
effect.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
for
that
reason
did
not
address
the
question
of
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
has
the
effect,
it's
not
necessary
that
the
act
is
violative
then,
is
it
not?
if
the
plan
has
the
effect
without
regard
to
whether
it
has
a
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
think
that
the
three-judge
court
was
wrong
in
addressing
purpose
on
the
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that's
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
district
court
said,
they
had
that
effect
and
therefore
we
don't
have
to
inquire
into
the
other
element
of
purpose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
that
what
the
district
court
did?
