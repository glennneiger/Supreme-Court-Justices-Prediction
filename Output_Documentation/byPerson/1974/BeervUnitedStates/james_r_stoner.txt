mr.
james
r.
stoner
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
comes
to
the
court
as
an
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
from
a
decision
by
a
three-judge
court
pursuant
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
it
deals
with
the
city
of
new
orleans.
the
city
of
new
orleans
in
1954
adopted
a
reorganization
of
its
form
of
government
and
adopted
a
mayor-council
form
of
government
whereby
the
mayor
of
the
city
assumes
the
executive
functions
and
a
seven-man,
seven-person
council
assumes
the
legislative
functions
of
the
city,
the
governing
of
the
city.
the
plan
provides
for
the
two
members
of
the
council
to
be
elected
at
large
from
the
entire
city
and
five
members
to
be
elected
from
specific
geographic
areas
of
the
city.
now,
the
city
charter
requires
that
after
each
federal
decennial
census,
the
council
of
the
city
has
the
obligation
to
redistrict
the
five
geographic
areas
of
the
city
so
that
each
area
in
each
district
will
be
as
nearly
as
possible
consisting
of
an
equal
number
of
voters.
the
city
charter
as
i
said
makes
this
mandatory
after
each
decennial
census.
this
case
comes
to
the
court
to
be
adjudicated
following
the
1970
decennial
census
in
a
plan
that
was
adopted
by
the
city
council.
but
a
little
bit
of
history
might
be
appropriate
in
considering
the
posture
of
a
case.
first,
following
the
1970
census,
the
city
council
had
the
obligation
to
redistrict
the
five
geographical
areas.
they
undertook
to
do
this
by
the
adoption
of
a
plan,
plan
i,
referred
to
in
the
briefs
in
the
record.
now
this
plan
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
pursuant
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
which
creates
a
system
whereby
a
changed
plan
can
be
made
operative
in
the
event
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
enter
an
objection.
in
this
case,
while
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
was
considering
the
plan,
there
was
talk
and
movement
in
the
city
for
a
procedure
whereby
the
city
council,
the
city
of
new
orleans
could
be
enlarged
and
indeed
during
the
time
that
the
attorney
general
is
considering
the
first
plan,
the
city
council
did
in
fact
adopt
an
ordinance
increasing
the
size
of
the
city
council
from
seven
members
to
11
members.
this
11-member
proposal
at
a
member
council
consisted
of
two
at
large
and
nine
geographic.
this
proposal
was
submitted
to
the
electorate
for
the
city
of
new
orleans
and
was
defeated
in
the
citywide
referendum.
the
city
council
then
adopted
a
plan
whereby
the
size
of
the
city
council
would
be
increased
from
seven
members
to
nine
members
with
two
at
large
and
seven
from
specific
geographic
districts.
this
again
was
submitted
to
the
electorate
and
upon
the
referendum,
the
proposal
was
defeated.
now,
following
this,
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
interposed
an
objection
to
plan
i.
now,
where
does
that
lead
the
city
council
of
new
orleans?
it
leads
the
city
council
of
new
orleans
with
the
obligation
to
redistrict
itself
for
the
five
geographic
districts
on
the
basis
of
a
five
geographic
district
council
and
two
at
large.
it
did
so.
it
adopted
what
has
been
referred
to
in
the
briefs
as
plan
ii
and
this
plan
was
submitted
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
the
attorney
general
interposed
an
objection
and
upon
interposing
an
objection,
the
interpose
--
imposition
of
the
attorney
general's
objection,
the
city
brought
an
action
pursuant
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
asking
the
three-judge
court
to
declare
that
the
plan
as
adopted
that
is
plan
ii
be
made
operative
and
be
held
to
be
in
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
it
could
have.
it
could
have
your
honor.
the
machinery
in
the
statute
allows
either
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
or
a
submission
to
the
attorney
general,
yes
it
could.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
there
is
no
--
mr.
james
r.
stoner
that
right.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
that
is
right,
your
honor.
now,
the
district
court,
the
three-judge
district
court
held
that
plan
ii
was
in
violation
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
and
it
is
that
that
we
disagree
with.
now,
let's
look
at
what
this
case
is
and
maybe
the
best
way
to
attack
what
the
case
is,
is
to
ask
what
it
is
not.
this
case
is
not
a
case
whereby
a
city
or
a
government
is
expanding
its
boundaries,
annexing
area
as
prior
cases
in
this
court.
it
is
not
that
kind
of
a
case
nor
is
it
a
case
where
the
city
is
changing
from
at
large
district
to
single
districts
or
from
single
districts
to
at
large
districts.
this
is
merely
a
case
where
the
city,
the
city
council
is
performing
its
obligation
to
redistrict
itself
pursuant
to
the
mandate
in
the
city
charter
which
as
i
stated
was
adopted
in
1954,
became
effective
in
1954.
so
the
case
before
the
court
is
a
redistricting
of
the
five-geographic
district.
now,
the
court
below
held
that
the
two
at-large
seats
had
to
be
considered
in
the
consideration
of
the
five-geographic
district
and
its
application
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
we
submit
and
most
vehemently
that
that
is
not
at
issue
and
that
this
court
should
overrule
the
district
court
on
that
point.
and
for
reason
we
state
as
follows.
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
applies
to
changes
that
are
made
in
a
voting
system.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
in
addition
restrictions
on
the
individual's
right
to
vote,
it
also
applies
to
cases
in
which
a
change
in
boundaries
etcetera
and
we
don't
dispute
with
that
issue.
we
do
however
submit
that
the
form
of
government
enacted
by
the
city
council
in
its
charter,
in
its
home
rule
charter
of
may
1,
1954
was
a
dual
system.
it
was
a
system
that
provided
for
the
election
of
two
members
of
its
council
from
the
entire
city
at
large
and
it
was
a
system
that
required
the
election
of
five
additional
members
of
its
city
council
from
geographic
districts
of
equal
population
--
of
equal
population.
now,
it
might
be
helpful
for
the
court
to
look
at
a
map
of
the
city.
i
have
here
which
is
--
incidentally
in
the
appendix
at
page
625,
620,
a
colored
map
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
and
interposed
on
that
colored
map
is
the
five
districts
as
composed
in
plan
ii
which
is
the
plan
before
the
court.
the
red
portion
of
this
map
represents
voters
of
the
black
race.
the
white,
i'm
sorry,
the
green
dots
represent
voters
of
the
white
race,
so
that
we
see
upon
an
examination
of
this
map
that
indeed
the
white
and
the
black
voters
of
the
city
are
scattered
throughout
many
sections
of
the
city.
now,
in
looking
at
this,
i
would
also
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
area
in
which
the
number
c
is
located.
this
is
the
only
part
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
that
is
across
the
mississippi
river
from
the
other
part
of
the
city.
in
other
words,
predominantly
the
geographic,
the
large
predominant
part
is
the
one
side
of
the
city
but
there
is
a
small
sliver
on
the
other
side
of
the
city.
this
section
across
the
river
is
called
algiers
and
the
record
shows
that
there
are
great
differences
of
opinion
between
the
people
of
algiers
and
the
people
of
the
city
as
to
the
necessity
of
another
bridge
across
the
mississippi
river
and
this
is
an
important
political
issue
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
not
only
in
the
algiers
section
but
also
in
the
main
section
of
the
section
of
the
city
itself
because
voters
in
one
section
of
the
city
don't
want
the
bridge
to
be
destroying
parts
of
their
city
for
the
abutment
and
the
piers
of
the
bridge
etcetera.
now,
this
case
involves
several
things.
it
involves
people,
it
involves
geography
and
it
involves
voters,
of
necessity
the
city
must
be
divided
geographically
in
order
to
meet
the
mandate
of
the
city
charter
of
creating
the
five
geographic
districts.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
i
refer
to
page
620
of
the
record
which
shows
the
geographic
redistricting
of
the
city
as
it
was
made
in
1961
following
the
1960
census
and
as
it
in
fact
exists
at
the
present
time
because
of
the
inoperativeness
of
plan
ii
and
you'll
note
there
that
the
algiers
section
of
the
city
is
included
in
district
a
and
you
also
note
that
the
other
part
of
--
mr.
james
r.
stoner
621.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
621.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
that's
right
because
of
the
interposing,
--
because
the
attorney
general
interposed
an
objection
and
because
the
court
has
failed
to
render
a
declaratory
judgment.
the
new
plan
cannot
go
into
effect.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
yes,
mr.
justice,
they
do.
they
are
--
each
one
of
the
district
said
is
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e
elect
one
member
of
the
city
council.
now,
as
i
stated,
two
additional
members
of
the
city
council
are
elected
at
large.
in
other
words,
there
is
a
dual
system
the
at
large
system
and
the
five
geographic.
now,
this
apportionment
of
the
city
is
founded
in
reason
and
founded
in
good
reason.
the
two
at
large
members
of
the
city,
city
council
have
the
obligation
of
representing
of
all
of
the
citizens
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
each
geographic
district
is
represented
by
one
person
on
the
council
and
presumably
that
person
represents
the
peculiar
interest
of
that
geographic
area
of
the
city.
and
very
important
factor
in
this
case
is
the
mississippi
river
and
the
economy
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
as
it
is
affected
by
the
mississippi
river.
the
mississippi
river
is
well-known
as
the
access
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
it
is
a
large
and
important
shipping
center
of
the
united
states
and
i
guess
invade
the
world.
now,
there's
testimony
in
this
case
and
i've
referred
to
the
testimony
of
a
councilman
morrow
and
i
believe
that
councilman
ciaccio
(ph)
also
testified
concerning
this
and
that
is
that
in
their
mind,
they
felt
that
it
was
important
that
each
one
of
these
five
geographic
areas
should
have
some
of
the
river
frontage
as
part
of
their
geographic
area
because
of
the
tremendous
importance
of
the
river
and
shipping
to
the
economy
and
to
the
life
of
the
city
and
the
people
of
new
orleans.
plan
ii,
as
adopted
by
the
city
council
and
the
plan
which
is
before
the
court,
is
also
represented
on
page
624
of
the
record
comparing
the
existed
plan
which
is
on
page
621
and
plan
ii
which
is
a
plan
before
the
court
on
page
624.
we
noticed
that
in
the
redistricting
plan,
the
part
across
the
river
in
algiers
in
a
has
been
transferred
from
section
a
or
from
district
a
to
district
c.
this
makes
the
entire
district
c
contiguous
on
both
sides
of
the
river.
it
also
enlarges,
geographic
section
a
and
geographic
section
b.
now,
at
the
time
the
plan
was
being
adopted
and
considered
by
the
city
council,
the
naacp
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
also
submitted
a
plan
of
redistricting
of
the
city.
this
appears
in
page
645
of
the
record
and
i
might
submit
that
the
plan
you
will
notice
in
many
respects
is
very
similar
particularly
with
respect
to
district
a
and
district
b.
it
is
changed
then
that
the
algiers
section
in
the
naacp
plan
is
included
in
district
d
whereas
the
plan
adopted
by
the
city
council
has
the
algiers
section
included
in
district
c.
you'll
also
note
from
the
naacp
plan
that
district
e
has
no
geographic
frontage
on
the
mississippi
river.
another
plan
we
submit
--
mr.
james
r.
stoner
your
honor,
the
district
lines
which
have
been
followed
in
redistricting
here
have
followed
the
traditional
north
south
lines
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
in
other
words
the
--
when
the
wards
of
the
city
were
established,
i
believe
it
was
in
1912.
the
wards
were
drawn
on
a
north-south
line
and
the
districts,
indeed
the
district
that
is
the
plan
that
is
presently
operative
does
operate
on
a
north-south
line
and
this
plan
operates
on
a
north-south
line.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
not
nearly
as
important
as
in
mississippi
river.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
that
is
true,
that
is
true
your
honor
and
i
believe
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
many
members
of
the
council
felt
it
was
important
that
a
councilman
for
one
particular
district
represent
also
in
addition
to
river
frontage,
that
he
also
represent
diverse
interest.
in
other
words,
the
testimony
in
the
council
and
in
the
record
that
some
of
the
councilmen
felt
that
it
was
important
that
a
councilman
be
answerable
not
only
to
one
economic
interest
or
one
economic
group
or
one
social
group
but
rather
that
it
be
answerable
to
all
and
hence
the
river
frontage
being
included
and
hence
some
of
the
higher
income
areas
being
included
in
the
various
districts.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
all
but
b.
yes,
now,
of
course
the
peculiar
curve
of
the
mississippi
if
you
don't
--
there
is
a
peculiar
curve
in
mississippi
there
which
would
appear
that
there
has
to
be
a
compact
district
and
it's
represented
by
a
district
b.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
they
do
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
i
believe
the
record
reflects
that.
it
does
but
the
possible
exception
of
b
which
is
a
predominantly
black
populated
section.
now
--
mr.
james
r.
stoner
that's
right
and
part
of
a
downtown
section.
but
it
also
contains
a
great
deal
of
the
river
frontage
and
the
business
and
the
interests
that
are
represented
by
river
front
property
and
people
of
who
are
located
all
over
the
river
front.
now,
plan
ii,
we
submitted
to
the
lower
court
and
we
are
before
this
court
and
the
lower
court
and
we
are
before
this
court
asking
the
court
to
reverse
the
lower
court
because
we
believe
the
lower
court
has
made
some
grievous
errors
in
its
decision.
number
one,
we
believe
that
the
inclusion
of
the
at
large
districts
in
the
consideration
of
the
five
geographic
areas
which
are
completely
wrong
and
the
reason
we
say
that
is
because
the
city
charter
has
a
dual
system
of
electing
its
council
members.
it
has
a
system
of
electing
two
at
large
and
it
has
a
system
of
electing
five
and
we
submit
that
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
says
that
the
act
applies
only
to
those
changes
that
are
made
after
november
1,
1964.
now,
the
change
in
the
at
large
system
has
not
been
made
by
the
plan
ii.
it
has
left
the
city
charter
as
it
was
and
for
good
reason.
the
two
at
large
councilmen
for
instance
perform
other
functions
in
the
city
government
in
addition
to
being
members
of
the
city
council.
for
instance,
one
of
them
is
the
chairman
of
the
city
council
and
that
rotates
between
the
two
at
large
every
four
months.
in
addition
to
that,
the
at
large
members
serve
under
water
and
sewer
board
and
otherwise
have
other
functions
as
described
in
our
brief.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
exactly,
your
honor.
exactly.
exactly,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
pardon.
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
yes
sir.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
i
think
you're
correct.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
it's
mandatory
under
the
city
charter.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
i
assume
that
a
mandamus
action
could
be
brought
by
any
citizen
to
compel
a
city
council
to
do
its
job,
namely,
to
redistrict.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
so
we
submit
as
stated
that
the
two
at
large
seats,
the
court
erred
completely
in
considering
the
two
at
large
seats.
now,
the
court
also
erred
previously,
we
believe
in
the
burden
of
proof
statement
which
the
court
has
made.
the
voting
rights
act
allows
a
change
plan
to
become
effective
upon
the
filing
of
a
declaratory
action
in
a
district
court
and
a
finding
that
the
plan
compliance
with
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
the
lower
court
in
this
case
has
said
that
the
moving
party,
that
is
in
this
case,
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
must
prove
that
the
plan
which
they
are
submitting
is
the
only
feasible
plan.
now,
we
submit
that
that
does
not
comply
with
the
traditional
declaratory
judgment
procedure
at
all.
congress
established
in
the
act
a
declaratory
judgment
procedure.
now,
what
is
a
declaratory
judgment
procedure?
it's
a
procedure
whereby
parties
come
before
a
court
and
asked
for
an
adjudication
of
their
interest
so
that
they
may
proceed
in
the
normal
course
of
events
and
the
normal
course
of
life.
in
that
kind
of
an
action,
declaratory
judgment,
it
has
always
been
held
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
now,
the
lower
court
has
said
that
in
this
case,
the
moving
party
must
prove
that
the
plan
is
the
only
and
i
emphasize
only
feasible
plan.
we
submit
that
that
just
is
not
proper
burden
of
proof.
indeed,
we
may
say
that
probably
no
plan
could
be
devised
which
is
the
only
plan
because
we
are
dealing
here
with
people,
we
are
dealing
with
geography.
and
without
belaboring
the
point
further,
we
submit
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
entirely
wrong.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
we
have
a
burden
of
proving
and
we
submit
your
honor
that
we
believe
that
the
burden
we
have
is
to
show
that
the
plan
is
a
feasible
plan
and
is
based
on
a
rational
basis,
a
rational
basis.
we
believe
that
our
burden
is
to
show
that
the
plan
is
a
plan
founded
in
reason
and
in
consideration
of
the
various
factors
which
are
at
play
in
any
one
area.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
well,
i
believe
that
the
statute
would
really
emphasize
that
our
obligations
are
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
and
i
believe
that
if
we
meet
the
constitutional
test
that
we
have
established,
we've
carried
our
burden
of
proof.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
both
apply
in
their
subtle
differences
i
believe
in
cases.
the
lower
court
applied
a
compelling
state
interest
--
mr.
james
r.
stoner
i
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
yes,
it
says
that
no
statute
or
no
procedure,
voting
procedure
shall
be
enacted
which
deprives
anyone
to
or
breaches
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
a
race
or
color.
yes,
your
honor.
the
lower
court
has
--
mr.
james
r.
stoner
that's
right,
your
honor.
but
we
would
submit
that
that
is
not
the
necessarily
stricter
than
the
constitutional
standard.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
you
mean
a
purpose
and
effect?
mr.
james
r.
stoner
yes.(voice
overlap)
we
--
the
lower
court
in
this
case
found
that
the
plan
i
submitted
had
the
effect
of
denying
and
bridging
and
therefore
he
said
--
pardon?
mr.
james
r.
stoner
that's
right,
it
did
not.
now,
we
submit
that
both
are
applicable
in
the
case
that
the
statute
says
the
purpose
and
effect.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
well,
we
would
submit
that
the
statute
says
the
purpose
and
effect
that
both
must
be
benefits.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
the
fourteenth,
i
believe
would
apply
more
to
a
restriction
on
the
individual
right
to
cast
a
vote.
the
fifteenth
is
somewhat
broader
i
would
believe.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
well,
it
is
your
honor
but
we
also
submit
that
the
court
misapplied
the
compelling
state
interest
doctrine.
what
the
lower
court
did
here
was
to
say
that
unless
the
black
population
is
given
this
maximal
voting
strength.
it
has
to
be
--
the
plan
has
to
be
denied
unless
the
court,
unless
the
moving
party
shows
a
compelling
state
interest.
now,
we
submit
that
that
is
an
improper
test
to
be
applied
in
this
case
because
we
say
the
compelling
state
interest
test
has
been
traditionally
applied
by
the
court
in
cases
in
which
there
has
been
a
restriction
on
the
individual
right
to
cast
a
vote.
and
i
mean
by
that
case
is
such
as
literacy
test
and
those
kind
of
cases.
now,
we
say
that
that
test
is
an
improper
test
in
a
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
we
have
heard
counsel
for
the
united
states
the
executive
department
of
the
united
states
government
and
we
have
heard
counsel
for
the
intervenor
state
that
because
of
the
two
at
large
seats,
the
white
vote
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
starts
out
at
the
outset
with
two
seats.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
both
counsel
had
neglected
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
the
record
shows
this
that
three
blacks
have
been
elected
in
other
elections
in
at
large
elections
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
in
the
past.
judge
morrell
was
elected
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
judge
israel
augustine
was
elected
to
the
criminal
district
court
and
dr.
spears
was
elected
to
the
present
new
orleans
parish
school
board
and
new
orleans
parish
is
the
same
geographic
limit
as
the
city
of
new
orleans.
now,
here
are
three
blacks
who
have
in
fact
run
for
political
office,
state
--
citywide
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
and
they've
won.
and
i
will
ask
my
opponent
counsel
to
consent
by
stipulation
of
the
court
to
also
bring
to
the
court's
attention
a
matter
which
occurred
in
1974,
november
1974
and
i'm
referring
to
the
election
of
edwin
lombard
on
a
citywide
basis,
a
black
candidate
elected
to
the
clerk
of
the
criminal
district
court
and
in
that
election,
he
defeated
a
white
incumbent
candidate.
now,
i
submit
that
we
cannot
start
with
a
proposition
and
both
counsel
had
taken
that
proposition
that
in
1970s
that
--
mr.
james
r.
stoner
you're
right
your
honor
and
i
will
say
that
--
and
i
will
say
that
the
united
states
government
by
the
executive
department
is
encouraging
bloc
voting
before
this
court
right
now
and
they
are
encouraging
racial
polarization.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
i
would
agree
with
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
james
r.
stoner
exactly.
exactly
your
honor.
i
would
submit
that
it's
the
obligation
of
government
to
encourage
people
to
live
harmoniously
together
and
the
history
of
the
world
shows
that
where
people
learn
to
live
harmoniously
together,
they
can
successfully
advance
their
interest.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
i
must
admit,
i
do
not
know.
i
have
not
made
a
study
of
city
councils
in
large
cities
in
the
south.
i
do
say,
however,
that
there
has
been
no
election
for
the
city
council
since
1968
or
1969
and
i
further
submit
that
this
court
must
look
at
the
conditions
in
new
orleans
as
existing
in
1970
not
as
they
existed
back
in
‘60s
or
the
‘50s.
sure
there
was
racial
discrimination,
parties
were
discriminated
against
but
--
mr.
james
r.
stoner
the
record
shows
substantially
that
that
situation
has
changed
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
the
court
this
time
is
a
re-argument
of
the
new
orleans
redistricting
case.
it
involves
the
city
of
new
orleans.
the
case
involves
geography,
the
case
involves
people.
the
case
involves
the
evolution
of
a
political
system
whereby
those
people
can
express
their
views
and
be
governed
by
their
elected
officials.
the
city,
as
is
--
as
is
most
cities
in
our
country,
has
a
black
population
and
a
white
population.
the
case
comes
before
the
court
pursuant
to
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
i
refer
the
court,
the
members
of
the
court
to
page
620
of
the
appendix
and
i
call
attention
to
a
map
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
which
shows
the
distribution
of
white
and
black
voters
in
the
district
--
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
it
is,
your
honor.
it
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
620.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
and
it
is
a
colored
map
showing
the
black
voters
in
red
and
the
white
voters
in
green,
and
i
shall
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
map
very
graphically
shows
the
distribution
of
black
voters
throughout
the
city
of
new
orleans
and
it
shows
the
--
very
graphically
the
distribution
of
white
voters
throughout
the
city
of
new
orleans,
and
it
shows
that
there
are
substantial
blacks
--
of
black
voters
in
every
section
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
now,
going
back
in
time
to
may
1,
1954,
and
i
might
say
that
this
was
substantially
before
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
was
enacted
in
the
legislation.
it
was
substantially
before
the
“one
man-one
vote
rule”
rule
that
was
decided
by
this
court.
the
city
of
new
orleans
adapted
a
reorganization
of
its
city
government.
it
adapted
a
city
charter
which
was
called
the
home
rule
charter
and
which
adapted
the
mayor
council
type
of
government.
it
established
for
the
first
time
a
mayor
who
was
--
had
the
primary
--
primarily
responsibility
of
being
the
executive
of
the
city
and
had
established
a
city
council
with
the
primary
the
legislative
functions.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
that
was
on
may
1,
1954.
the
home
rule
city
charter
established
a
city
council
as
the
legislative
body,
consisting
of
two
members
who
would
be
elected
at
large,
that
is,
by
the
entire
city,
by
the
entire
population
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
it
also
established
five
single-member
districts
so
that
the
entire
city
council,
the
legislative
body
consisted
of
seven
members,
two
elected
at
large,
five
elected
from
individual
districts
within
the
city.
now,
the
city
charter,
the
home
rule
charter,
adapted
in
may
1,
1954
had
another
provision
and
that
was
an
another
important
provision,
and
that
important
provision
made
it
mandatory
for
the
city
council
to
redistrict
itself,
that
is,
the
five
individual
districts
after
every
decennial
census.
this
was
an
attempt
to
--
to
require
that
each
single-member
district
would
be
made
up
of,
as
closely
as
possible,
an
equal
number
of
voters.
in
1961,
following
the
first
decennial
census
after
the
adaption
of
the
home
rule
charter,
the
city
council
did
in
fact
redistrict
itself.
now,
at
that
time,
there
were
no
challenges
to
the
redistricting
and
members
were
elected
from
the
five
individual
districts
and
also,
of
course,
from
the
two
at
large
districts.
in
1969,
the
present
city
council
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
was
elected.
they
took
office
on
may
1970.
of
course,
1970
was
a
census
year
and
under
the
requirement
of
the
city
charter,
the
city
council
was
required
to
redistrict
the
five
districts
following
that
census
and
prior
to
the
next
election
which
would
have
been
held
under
normal
schedules
in
the
fall
of
1973
with
the
elected
officials
to
take
office
in
may
of
1974.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
they
are
four-year
terms.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
these
are
four-year
terms
for
each
member
of
the
council,
that
is,
at
the
at
large
members
as
well
as
the
members
from
a
single-member
districts.
now,
in
1965
the
congress
passed
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965,
and
its
application
to
the
change
of
the
redistricting
is
not
attached
--
is
not
attacked
in
this
case.
everyone
admits
that
it
was
the
city
council,
having
redistricted
itself
following
the
--
that
act
was
required
to
submit
it
--
submit
the
plan
to
the
attorney
general.
now,
the
city
council
adopted
a
plan
of
redistricting.
it
held
public
hearings,
extensive
public
hearings.
during
the
extensive
public
hearings,
it
was
evident
that
large
segments
of
the
community
felt
that
the
size
of
the
city
council
should
be
increased.
the
council
adopted
a
plan
to
increase
the
size
of
the
city
council
from
seven
members
to
eleven
members,
retaining
two
at
large
and
electing
--
proposing
to
elect
nine
members
from
single-member
districts.
this
was
submitted
to
the
electorate,
it
was
defeated.
again,
the
city
council
adapted
another
plan
whereby
the
city
council
would
be
enlarged
from
a
seven-member
council
to
a
nine-member
council,
two
to
be
elected
at
large,
seven
from
single-member
districts.
this
plan
was
presented
to
the
electorate,
it
was
defeated.
now,
at
that
point,
the
city
council
was
faced
with
the
mandatory
requirement
that
it
redistrict
itself
and
that
it
redistrict
itself
in
accordance
with
a
seven-member
council
which
was
the
law,
it
having
submitted
the
--
the
eleven-member
proposal
and
the
nine-member
proposal
to
the
electorate
having
been
--
having
been
defeated.
at
that
time,
the
city
council
adapted
plan
ii,
and
plan
ii
is
the
plan
which
is
now
before
this
court.
it
submitted
the
plan
to
the
attorney
general
for
approval.
the
attorney
general
did
not
approve
the
plan
and
whereupon
the
city
council,
believing
that
the
plan
was
a
reasonable
and
rational
plan
for
redistricting
itself,
filed
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
asking
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
that
court
--
that
court
denied
the
request
for
the
declaratory
judgment,
and
it
is
from
that
decision
which
we
have
appealed
and
which
brings
this
case
to
the
court
at
the
present
time.
now,
may
i
refer
the
court
to
page
621
of
the
appendix
which
shows
a
map
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
and
the
districts,
various
districts
as
they
were
established
in
1961,
and
indeed,
which
--
which
is
the
present
district
plan.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
621,
mr.
justice.
the
city
charter
required
that
the
council
redistrict
itself.
i
shall
like
to
point
out
the
geography.
i
mentioned
in
my
opening
statement
the
geography
is
involved
in
this
matter.
if
you
will
look
at
the
city
of
new
orleans,
you
will
see
that
one
of
the
predominant
geographic
features
is
the
mississippi
river
which
flows
through
the
city.
there
is
only
one
part
of
the
city
that
is
west
of
the
mississippi
and
that
in
the
plan
which
i
refer
to,
is
a
part
identified
(a)
part,
and
that
is
--
that
section
of
the
city
is
--
is
west
of
the
mississippi
and
is
known
as
the
algiers
section.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
it
is
substantially
separated.
now,
and
this
is
an
important
factual
feature
in
the
consideration
of
plan
ii
which
is
before
the
court.
let
me
say
that
there
is
substantial
evidence
in
the
record
which
shows
that
the
citizens
of
algiers
were
very
interested
in
having
a
bridge
across
the
mississippi
river.
they
wanted
some
way
to
get,
i
should
say
another
bridge,
they
wanted
some
way
to
get
from
the
western
part
of
the
city
on
the
west
side
of
the
mississippi
to
the
central
and
main
part
of
the
city.
the
many
citizens
across
the
river
that
is
in
the
main
section
of
the
city
were
opposed
to
this
and
this
was
a
very
--
very
hotly
debated
issue.
many
people
wanted
the
bridge
to
be
somewhere
--
somewhere
else
in
some
other
section
of
the
city
so
that
this
factor
was
an
important
factor
in
considering
the
reapportionment,
the
redistricting
of
the
city.
referring
to
page
624,
which
is
likewise
a
map
of
the
city
and
which
shows
plan
ii,
plan
ii
which
is
the
plan
presented
before
the
court
today.
you
will
note
that
in
the
plan
that
has
been
adapted,
as
plan
ii,
the
section
in
algiers
is
connected
with
a
contiguous
area
across
the
mississippi
river
so
that
section
--
so
that
district
c
comprises
the
entire
algiers
section
of
the
city
as
well
as
some
of
the
riverfront
section
of
the
city
and
up
into
the
major
downtown
area
of
the
city
and
in
fact,
running
to
lake
pontchartrain
which
is
at
the
very
top
of
the
--
of
the
page.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
on
624,
that
is
plan
ii,
namely
the
plan
which
is
presently
before
the
--
before
the
court.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
it
is,
your
honor.
620,
however
has
the
color
--
the
color
added
showing
the
distribution
of
black
and
white
voters
in
the
city.
now,
the
city
council
adapted
this
plan
taking
into
consideration
numerous
factors,
not
the
least
of
which
is
the
importance
of
the
mississippi
river
and
the
commerce
and
the
industry
that
is
along
the
river
to
the
--
to
the
city
of
new
orleans
to
the
wellbeing
of
the
people
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
and
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
council
members
believed
that
it
was
important
that
each
section
in
the
city,
that
is
each
district,
should
have
a
part
of
the
geography
of
the
riverfront
in
the
section
--
in
the
district
so
that
each
member
of
the
city
council
would
have
the
economic
interest
of
the
effect
of
the
river
on
the
population
and
on
the
life
and
industry
and
commerce
of
the
city.
you
will
note
their
plan
ii
does
in
fact
contain
a
part
of
the
river
frontage
in
each
of
the
five
member
districts.
we
submit
that
the
plan
--
the
plan
ii
is
a
reasonable
plan,
that
it
has
been
adapted
taking
into
consideration
reasonable
rational
reasons
for
the
adaption
of
the
plan
and
the
division
of
the
city
in
the
districts
as
presented.
now
--
mr.
james
r.
stoner
i
believe
that
the
lower
part
of
the
city
is
substantially
a
dock
area
with
shipping.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
it
would
appear
to
be,
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
it
is.
now,
this
was
the
plan
that
was
presented
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
this
was
the
plan
out
of
which
has
come
the
--
the
appeal
which
we
have
before
the
court
today.
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
error
which
the
district
court
made
was
its
error
in
holding
that
the
two
at
large
seats
on
the
city
council
were
affected
by
and
must
be
included
in
any
plan
that
is
considered
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
now,
we
submit
that
this
was
patently
wrong.
the
city
charter
creates
two
seats
which
--
whose
members
are
elected
at
large.
it
creates
the
five
districts
also.
there
has
been
no
change,
no
change
in
the
two
at
large
voting
systems
since
its
adaption
in
may
1,
1954.
now,
the
voting
rights
act
applies
to
any
changes
that
are
made
in
voting
procedures
following,
i
believe
the
date
is,
november
1,
1964.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
it
does
sir.
that
was
my
understanding
and
i
believe
that
is
a
change
--
mr.
james
r.
stoner
i
believe
that
is
--
that
is
correct.
so
that
we
submit
that
the
lower
court
erred
in
holding
that
the
two
at
large
seats
were
changed.
we
submit
that
there
was
in
effect
a
--
a
two-segment
voting
procedure.
one
was
electing
two
council
members
at
large
and
the
other
was
electing
five
members
from
single-member
districts
divided
in
equal
population
numbers.
we
submit
that
the
at
large
seats
are
not
in
any
way
affected
by
this.
we
submit
that
they
are
not
affected
by
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
and
that
they
should
not
be
considered
and
the
court
erred
and
substantially
erred
in
holding
that
the
two
at
large
seats
were
affected
by
the
redistricting
plan.
now,
i
might
point
out
that
the
two
at
large
seats,
in
addition
to
their
regular
responsibilities
as
council
members,
have
other
responsibilities
that
are
prescribed
by
the
charter.
for
instance,
the
chairmanship
of
the
city
council
rotates
every
four
months
between
the
two
members
at
large.
furthermore,
the
two
members
at
large
sit
on
various
city
--
city
agencies.
one
is
the
reduction
of
debt,
that
is
not
the
correct
term,
but
it
is
described
in
--
in
our
brief,
the
stadium
commission,
and
so
forth.
so
that
the
two
members
at
large
have
somewhat
different
responsibilities
and
--
responsibilities
that
are
over
and
above
the
responsibilities
of
all
the
other
members
of
the
--
of
the
city
council.
so
that
in
effect,
the
plan,
and
again
i
must
--
i
cannot
emphasize
too
strongly
that
this
is
the
plan
that
was
adapted
back
in
1954,
long
before
the
voting
rights
act
and
long
before
any
--
any
other
attacks
and
that
plan
incidentally
was
never
attacked
by
any
voter
to
my
knowledge,
that
claimed
that
there
was
something
constitutionally
wrong
with
the
city
charger
adapted
in
1954.
it
had
never
been
attacked.
now,
in
this
respect,
this
case
is
different
than
many
other
cases
that
have
come
before
this
court
under
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
city
has
gone
out
in
the
next
land.
it
is
not
a
city
where
--
it
is
not
a
case
where
a
city
has
changed
its
basic
philosophy
of
electing
its
legislative
unit
or
legislative
body.
it
is
a
case
where
there
has
been
no
change
of
any
kind
in
the
city
charter
and
in
the
establishment
of
the
this
city
council,
except
that
following
the
mandatory
requirement
that
the
charter
required,
namely
that
every
10
years,
after
every
decennial
census
it
must
redistrict
itself
so
that
each
of
the
single-member
districts
are
divided
as
nearly
as
possible
into
districts
of
equal
population.
so,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
this
case
is
different
than
other
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court.
it
is
not
a
case
where
there
is
any
attempt
or
any
blatant
attempt
or
any
apparent
attempt
or
any
so-called
attempt
to
change
or
to
--
to
the
city
form
of
government
or
to
change
an
election
procedure.
it
is
merely
changing
a
district,
the
districts
of
the
five
individual
districts,
as
is
required
by
the
forward-looking,
and
i
submit
it
was
a
forward-looking
city
charter
that
was
adapted
in
1954.
so,
the
case
is
unique
and
the
case
is
different
from
other
cases
that
have
come
before
the
court
in
that
respect
and
the
only
matter
before
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
five-member
plan,
as
encompassed
in
plan
ii,
is
a
reasonable
plan
and
a
rational
plan
that
does
not
violate
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
and
does
not
deny
or
abridge
the
right
of
any
citizen
to
cast
his
vote
in
a
municipal
election.
now,
we
submit
that
the
court
below
erred
in
its
application
of
the
--
of
the
test.
we
say
that
the
proper
test
to
be
applied
to
this
plan
is
whether
or
not
it
is
a
reasonable
plan,
whether
or
not
it
is
a
rational
plan,
whether
or
not
it
is
based
on
reasonable
considerations
that
a
city
council
should
take
into
consideration
when
it
adapts
a
plan
of
redistricting
itself.
we
have
set
forth
the
criteria,
which
have
been
used
in
our
brief,
which
were
used
in
adapting
the
plan.
i
might
say
parenthetically
that
traditionally,
the
districts
of
the
various
--
the
lines
of
the
various
districts
have
run
in
a
north-south
manner.
now,
this
is
not
happenstance.
the
city
of
new
orleans
i
guess,
as
we
all
know,
is
built
basically
on
a
swamp
land
and
in
recapturing
the
land,
numerous
canals
were
built
to
take
away
the
excess
water
and
so
forth.
now,
these
canals
basically
run
in
a
north-south
position
--
direction
and
they
basically
run
from
the
lake
pontchartrain
area
to
the
mississippi
river,
to
the
mississippi
river.
if
you
will
note
the
1961
plan,
the
1961
plan
runs
in
a
north-south
direction.
indeed,
the
old
ward
lines
in
the
city
ran
in
a
north-south
direction
and
i
believe
those
wards
were
established
in
the
late
1800s
or
early
1900s.
so
that,
traditionally,
in
the
city,
the
main
arteries
of
the
city
and
i
am
talking
canals
and
in
later
years,
the
--
the
streets,
the
predominant
streets
do
run
in
a
north-south
area.
the
plan
has
great
basis
in
reasonableness.
it
has
followed
the
traditional
lines
of
the
city.
it
has
followed
the
traditional
movement
of
the
city.
it
has
taken
into
consideration
the
important
economic
interest
of
the
mississippi
river
and
the
commerce
and
--
and
jobs
that
it
produces.
in
addition
to
that,
referring
again
to
the
population
spread,
i
must
point
out
that
the
black
population
is
spread
throughout
the
city.
it
is
not
a
population
that
is
concentrated
in
one
area
of
the
city
as
we
all
know,
happens
in
many
of
our
great
urban
areas.
rather,
the
black
population
is
spread
throughout
the
city
and
i
submit
that,
indeed,
the
plan
that
is
before
the
court
is
a
plan
which
has
members
of
the
council
representing
black
voters,
representing
white
voters,
representing
the
interests
of
the
mississippi
river,
representing
the
interest
of
the
lake
pontchartrain
area.
it
is
a
diversified
interest,
and
i
submit
that
in
a
plan
of
government,
this
is
a
strength.
it
is
the
strength
of
the
system
and
may,
in
fact,
be
the
genius
of
the
mayor
council
form
of
government,
namely
adapted
by
the
city
of
new
orleans,
namely
it
has
the
two
at
large
seats
which
represent
all
of
the
people
and
are
answerable
to
all
of
the
people
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
in
addition
to
that,
it
has
single-member
districts
which
are
answerable
to
the
people
within
that
district,
but
at
the
same
time,
rather
than
being
answerable
only
to
one
segment
of
the
society
and
one
segment
of
the
community,
they
are
answerable
to
a
broad,
a
spread
of
interests,
and
therefore,
it
would
appear
that
members
of
the
council
who
are
answerable
to
broad
segments
of
the
population
that
are
answerable
to
broad
economic
interest,
broad
social
interest
will
together
provide
a
better
government,
a
better
form
of
government
than
will
a
number
of
members
on
a
city
council,
each
of
one
of
whom
--
each
of
one
of
whom
is
answerable
to
a
very
tight
segment
of
the
population
and
we
submit
that
this
is
one
of
the
great
strengths
of
a
plan
that
has
been
submitted
and
is
--
is
before
the
court.
now,
the
lower
court
made
one
other
serious
error
that
--
that
we
feel
is
important
and
should
be
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
at
this
time
in
addition
to
those
fully
expressed
in
our
brief
and
that
is
that
the
district
court
has
said
that
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
city
is
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
plan
presented
is
the
“only
plan
that
is
feasible.”
we
submit
that
this
is
a
proper
--
improper
burden
of
proof.
we
submit
that
in
a
declaratory
judgment
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
should
be
the
test
that
no
reasonable
person
can
assume
that
in
the
myriad
problems
evolved
in
a
redistricting
that
there
can
be
only
one
plan.
we
submit
that
the
court
erred
in
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
a
few
moments
for
rebuttal?
mr.
james
r.
stoner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
important
issues
that
i
shall
like
to
respond
to.
one,
there
has
been
a
statement
and
that
appears
also
in
the
briefs
and
it
appears
in
the
lower
court’s
decision
that
the
two
at
large
seats
automatically
go
to
the
white
population.
and,
as
basis
for
this,
the
lower
court
refers
to
the
fact
that
there
never
has
been
a
black
elected
to
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
alright,
i
submit
that
number
one,
there
has
not
been
an
election
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
since
1969.
furthermore,
the
record
clearly
shows
that
blacks
have
one
substantial
--
elections
to
substantial
positions
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
and
i
refer
to
the
election
of
judge
muriel
who
was
elected
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
a
citywide
basis
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
he
is
a
black.
i
refer
to
judge
israel
augustine
who
is
elected
to
the
criminal
district
court
in
the
entire
city
of
new
orleans.
i
refer
to
dr.
spears
who
is
a
black
educator
and
who
was
elected
on
a
citywide
basis
to
the
new
orleans
parish
school
board
and
indeed
was
elected
as
the
president
of
that
board
on
a
citywide
basis.
in
addition
to
that,
since
the
trial
of
this
case
in
the
district
court,
in
november
1974
a
man
by
the
name
of
edwin
l.
j.
lombard,
a
black,
was
elected
on
a
citywide
basis
to
the
clerk
of
the
criminal
district
court
and
he
defeated
a
white
incumbent
of
that
office.
now,
i
do
not
know
what
better
evidence
we
--
we
can
bring
before
any
court
to
show
that
blacks
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
can
be
elected
to
office
on
a
citywide
basis.
of
course,
it
requires
that
the
black
community
nominate
and
bring
forward
responsible
human
beings.
when
responsible
human
beings
are
--
are
brought
forward,
it
appears
that
the
city
of
new
orleans
and
the
electorate
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
will,
in
fact,
elect
them
to
office.
so,
we
must
take
a
issue
and
great
issue
with
the
statements
of
the
lower
court
that
blacks
cannot
be
elected
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
when
running
at
large
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
and
we
do
not
concede
that
a
black
cannot
be
elected
to
the
at
large
seats
in
this
case.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
the
court
does
allude
to
that.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
that
is
right.
mr.
james
r.
stoner
i
believe
in
the
1970s
that
is
certainly
is
the
case,
and
i
would
submit
that
this
case
must
be
decided
on
the
facts
as
they
exist
in
1970
and
the
undue
evidences
on
the
facts
of
the
--
the
voting
situation
in
louisiana
and
indeed
in
new
orleans
years
back
--
years
back
has
no
place
in
the
decision
of
this
court.
this
court
--
this
case
should
be
decided
on
the
facts
as
they
existed
in
1975.
my
second
point,
and
i
--
we
were
looking
at
maps
earlier
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
map
which
appears
at
page
625
and
i
represent
to
the
court,
this
is
the
proposal
that
was
made
by
the
national
association
of
colored
people
for
the
city
of
new
orleans.
now,
we
must
agree
that
they
have
been
a
responsible
black
organization
and
this
is
their
proposal
for
the
redistricting
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
you
will
note
that
the
redistricting
lines
run
north
and
south.
you
will
note
that
section
--
district
a
and
district
b
are
practically
the
same
as
that
in
plan
ii.
you
will
note
that
the
most
significant
difference
is
that
the
algiers
section
across
the
river
is
connected
with
section
d
rather
than
section
c.
the
plan
submitted
puts
algiers
with
district
c.
we
submit
that
this
is
a
reasonable
plan
--
that
plan
ii
follows
the
thinking
of
the
black
community
at
the
time
that
this
plan
was
adapted
and
we
further
submit
that
we
take
issue
with
the
east-west
idea
of
redistricting
which
runs
throughout
the
briefs
of
the
government
and
also
of
the
interveners.
thank
you,
your
honor.
