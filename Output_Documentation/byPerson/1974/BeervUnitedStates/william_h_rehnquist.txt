justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
then
that
the
district
court
didn't
have
authority
to
review
the
provision
as
to
at
large
council
because
that
wasn't
the
change
that
was
introduced
after
the
effective
date
of
the
voting
rights
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stoner.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
have
happened
had
the
city
of
new
orleans
done
nothing
after
the
1970
census.
i
suppose
someone
could
have
brought
an
action
in
the
district
court
under
reynolds
against
simms
or
those
kinds
of
cases
to
compel
them
to
redistrict.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
under
our
case
of
connor
against
johnson,
the
voting
rights
act
doesn't
apply
to
a
redistricting
that's
done
under
the
edges
of
a
federal
court
decree.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
--
let
me
ask
you
a
little
further,
but
the
statute
also
prohibits
you
from
adopting
a
procedure,
you
have
to
show
the
procedure
doesn't
have
the
purpose
and
we'll
not
have
the
effect
of
denying
or
abridging
the
right
up
on
that
stricter
than
the
constitutional
standard,
you're
bound
to
come
up
with
a
statutory
standard,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
reapportionments
and
redistrictings
are
undertaken
at
the
initiative
of
the
legislative
body,
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
it
said
was
a
decree
of
the
united
states
district
court
is
not
within
reach
of
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
which
certainly
contains
substantive
standards
as
well
as
procedural,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
dilution
test
comparative
or
not?
i
mean,
are
you
comparing
with
a
maximum
minority
leverage
that
might
be
gone
from
a
particular
plan
or
are
you
comparing
it
with
what
is
in
existence
now?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
were
literally
not
changed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
district
court
went
ahead
and
more
or
less
set
aside
not
only
the
new
seats
but
the
seats
at
large
and
they
literally
are
not
within
the
language
of
the
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
speak
of
dividing
the
black
concentration,
looking
at
that
map
that
mr.
wallace
per
drawing
on
page
620,
the
one
with
the
green
dots
and
the
red
dot,
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
what
i
would
call
a
concentration.
it
looks
like
a
minority
voters
are
pretty
well
spread
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
what
if
the
city
council
sits
down
and
says
“this
--
this
existing
plan
we
have
--
that
we
have
now
that
was
not
subject
to
the
voting
rights
act
does
seem
to
us
a
little
bit
unfair
to
blacks,
so
we
are
going
to
give
them
a
better
break”
and
they
decide
to
pass
this,
assume
that
this
corresponds
to
that
--
that
description.
you
say
then
that
even
if
it
can
be
shown
in
the
abstract
that
this
plan
has
the
purpose
or
effect,
even
though
it
is
an
improvement
over
their
prior
law
that
it
is
within
the
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
you
not
judge
intent
on
the
basis
of
the
circumstances
that
existed
at
the
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
compared
to
the
previous
plan?
