mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
act
mr.
wallace,
do
you
think
the
act
contemplates
and
intends
to
encourage
bloc
voting
by
racial
groups?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
mean
to
say
about
the
burden
of
proof
standard
used
by
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that's
all
the
district
court
required?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace
says
that
something
like
that,
he
said
he
did
not
think
it
was
a
purpose
of
the
act
or
the
objective
of
congress
to
encourage
bloc
or
racial
voting.
i
take
it
obviously
you
would
agree
with
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
say
their
practice
in
the
department
of
justice
is
not
consistent
with
that
expression
of
philosophy.
chief
justice
warren
e.

chief

warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
stoner.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
provision
of
the
act
do
you
rely
on
to
support
the
district
court’s
selecting
as
the
standard
the
only
feasible
plan?
what
provision
of
the
act
generates
that
as
the
test?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
do
they
get
the
authority,
if
not
under

act?
chief

mr.

chief

what
do
you
say
congress,
what
provision
of
the
act
authorizes
the
standard
that
was
used
by
the
court
here,
the
only
feasible
plan?
is
there
any
such
thing
as
the
only
feasible
plan?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
can
only
go
by
what
the
court
said
it
was
used
as
a
yard
stick?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
understand
your
argument
to
be
that
the
obligation
of
the
city
is
to
so
carve
and
arrange
these
districts
as
to
produce
the
maximum
concentrated
vote
of
the
minority?
chief

four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
to
the
experience
over
the
whole
country

demonstrated
that
that
is
a
curious
theory
with
the
--
the
number
of
negroes
elected
mayors?

case
