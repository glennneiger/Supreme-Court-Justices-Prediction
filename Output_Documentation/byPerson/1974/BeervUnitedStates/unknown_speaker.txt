unknown
speaker
was
it
621?
unknown
speaker
and
it
certainly
is
separated
from
the
other
part
of
(a)
in
1961,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
not
connected
it
all?
unknown
speaker
where
is
this
recorded?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
is
the
same
really
as
that
on
620?
unknown
speaker
division
e,
of
course,
is
pretty
short
on
the
river
compared
to
the
others,
is
it
not?
does
it
make
any
difference
or
maybe
there
is
a
concentration
of
industry
along
d?
unknown
speaker
the
river
area
after
d
is
far
less
than
all
of
the
others?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
from
the
supplemental
briefs,
the
government
agrees
with
you
on
this
part?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
they
argued
it
the
last
time,
as
i
recall
it,
i
think?
unknown
speaker
so
that
even
if
there
is
an
improvement,
it
still
may
violate
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
and
even
though
it
would
survive
any
sort
of
constitutional
attack?
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
the
same
view
of
the
two
at
large
seats,
mr.
wallace,
if
there
had
in
fact
been
an
annexation
so
that
you
have
an
enlargement
of
the
suit?
unknown
speaker
the
annexation
unquestionably
would
have
been,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
is
what
you
told
them?
yes.
unknown
speaker
your
answer
is
yes,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
it
may
well
be
what
this
case
is
involves,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
what
--
under
constitution
of
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
but
that
only
involves
a
change
under
the
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
you
did
not
approve
this
one
and
if
this
was
an
improvement
over
the
old
one,
obviously
you
would
not
have
approved
the
old
one
if
it
had
been
a
change
over
a
predecessor,
that
says
nothing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
before
you
sit
down
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
the
district
court’s
opinion
is
based
primarily
on
mathematical
deductions
which
in
turn
are
based
on
total
population
and
registered
voters.
in
note
19
of
your
brief,
your
original
brief,
you
include
figures
also
showing
the
percentage
of
population
--
of
voting
age
and
if
the
voting
age
percentage
is
substituted
for
total
population
percentage,
the
figures
change,
whether
significantly
or
not
i
do
not
know,
but
they
do
change
from
45%
of
total
population
being
negro
to
39.8%
being
negro.
i
would
think
and,
well,
i
will
ask
you,
which
do
you
think
is
more
relevant,
total
population
or
voting
age
population?
unknown
speaker
if
you
apply
voting
age
percentage
to
the
five
seats,
you
come
back
with
an
entitlement
to
one
seat.
it
is
almost
two,
but
it
is
not
quite
two?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
have
excluded
the
at
large
seats?
unknown
speaker
mr.
halpin,
you
--
you
have
cited
on
page
5
of
your
supplemental
brief,
senator
bai’s
statement
with
reference
to
richmond?
unknown
speaker
in
a
sentence
that
section
5
requires
a
redistricting
plan
and
which
a
comparable
portion
of
the
seats
as
substantial
black
majorities,
does
this
suggest
that
on
the
remand
here
that
the
plan
has
to
be
one
which
comes
up
with,
what
is
it,
39%
of
the
seven
seats?
unknown
speaker
it
is
totally
a
virtual
decision.
it
does
not
study
the
general
principle
which
will
be
applicable?
unknown
speaker
try
to
affirm
what
are
the
standards
of
this
three-judge
court?
unknown
speaker
that
goes
beyond
this
original
standard
or
the
standard
that
was
applied
originally.
i
would
agree
to
that,
as
you
know,
i
dissented
from
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
halpin,
do
you
think
it
is
an
improvement
over
what
existed
before?
i
take
it,
you
--
you
feel
if
it
is,
it
still
is
not
enough?
unknown
speaker
mr.
halpin,
let
me
go
back
where
i
was.
suppose
the
council
were
not
under
the
ten-year
obligation
to
redistrict
and
it
just
went
ahead
and
redistricted
it,
hoping
that
this
was
an
improvement
over
what
happened
a
year
ago.
do
i
understand,
or
at
least
i
think
i
do
from
mr.
wallace’s
position
anyway,
that
this
--
if
the
effect
still,
even
though
an
improvement,
was
to
dilute
voting
strength,
one
or
another
group,
it
runs
afoul
with
section
5?
unknown
speaker
what
going
to
stop
the
city
council
from
just
sitting
flat
and
doing
nothing
and
letting
what
was
bad
before
continue?
unknown
speaker
the
question
i
made,
good
intentions
mean
nothing?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
is
an
improvement
over
what
there
was
before?
