can
you
help
me
on
this?
i
just
don't
understand
how
you
would
question
can
be
answered
to
show
that
you
intelligently
waived
your
right
to
counsel?
are
you
going
to
do
a
little
week
more
with
him
or
how
are
going
to
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
said
“can
you
handle
your
own
defense?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
what
he
did.
if
he
says
“yes”
that
would
mean
a
thing
to
me
because
he
doesn't
know
what
a
defense
from
the
holding
ground.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
quarrel
at
that
stage
the
judge
saying
“go
ahead
and
conduct
your
defense
but
i'm
going
to
leave
that
lawyer
there
in
case
you
need
him.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
wouldn't
object
to
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
have
to
tell
me
what
the
key
to
trying
the
case
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i've
tried
a
few.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
tried
a
few
in
california.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
falk,
can
i
get
this
thing
straightened
out
about
this
standby
counsel?
i
want
to
--
when
i
was
talking
to
you,
did
i
understand
you
and
i
to
be
talking
about
a
standby
counsel
who
only
gave
advice
and
did
whatever
the
man
told
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
we
were
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
the
standby
counsel
you're
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
not
the
one
that
actually
takes
over?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
other
right
that
a
defendant
has
that
he
can't
waive
other
than
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
under
the
united
states
constitution
is
my
question.
