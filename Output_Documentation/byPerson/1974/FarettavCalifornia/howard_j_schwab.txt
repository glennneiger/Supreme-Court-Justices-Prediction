mr.
howard
j.
schwab
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
represent
himself
without
counsel,
and
whether
this
exists
in
criminal
trials,
has
been
described
in
the
words
of
the
second
circuit
as
to
whether
or
not
a
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
go
to
jail
under
his
own
banner.
i
submit
your
honors,
that
the
defendant
has
no
such
right.
rather
he
has
a
right
under
the
constitution
to
a
fair
trial.
a
good
working
definition
of
a
fair
trial
was
set
forth
in
the
california
case
of
people
versus
sharp
in
7
cal.
3d
defining
it
as
follows
“proceedings
which
will
accord
him
the
fullest
opportunity
to
preserve
all
trial
rights
and
successfully
defend
against
the
charges.”
a
fair
trial
is
the
definition
of
due
process,
and
to
mandate
that
a
defendant
has
a
constitutional
right
to
defend
himself
without
counsel
could
have
the
opposite
effect.
a
good
example
is
this
case,
and
i
must
differ
with
petitioner
in
his
interpretation
of
the
taking
away
of
the
appropriate
privileges
in
this
case.
the
defendant
was
confused
as
to
the
hearsay
rule
and
equated
it
to
the
best
evidence
rule.
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
i
think
that
well,
perhaps
on
individual
points
but
it
goes
on.
for
example,
he
also
was
confused
as
to
the
number
of
peremptory
challenges.
now,
an
attorney
maybe
confused
to
one
or
two
points
of
law,
but
there
was
a
continuous
--
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
well
he
said
there
were
12
peremptories,
and
under
california
penal
code
section
1070
in
the
case
of
this
type,
he
has
10.
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
yes,
under
penal
code
section
1070,
he
only
has
10.
we
arguing
in
this
case
your
honor
--
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
that's
true,
but
problem
is
that
he
was
in
ignorance
and
all
of
a
sudden
had
used
up
his
10
and
thought
he
had
two
more,
it
maybe
too
late
for
the
court
to
help
him
out.
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
that's
true
but
the
as
--
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
i'm
sorry
your
honor?
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
but
as
this
court
said
in
mayberry
versus
pennsylvania
that
laymen
often
make
awkward
scenes.
and
i
think
this
is
true
much
more
of
layman
than
more
of
attorneys.
and
what
we're
arguing
and
what
california
is
arguing
is
not
that
the
defendant
can
never
represent
himself,
but
rather
he
has
not
constitutional
right
to
do
so.
and
this
in
turn
will
give
a
track
or
a
wide
discretion
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
accept
a
waiver.
i
submit
your
honors
that
petitioner
has
not
shown
the
source
of
any
constitutional
right
of
self-representation.
history
shows
no
right
and
we
have
discussed
the
history
in
our
briefs.
but
--
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
well
i
think
--
i
don't
argue
the
policy
of
the
states
because
this
is
a
statutory
scheme.
but
i
do
argue
here
is
the
constitutional
basis
whether
or
not
an
individual
state
will
desire
to
give
a
defendant
rights
of
representation
is
really
not
the
issue.
the
question
is
does
he
have
the
constitutional
right
and
--
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
correct,
under
the
federal
constitution.
and
under
the
common
law,
self-representation
was
not
a
right
but
was
a
tyrannical
practice
enforced
by
crown
and
the
kings
to
ensure
victories,
and
to
ensure
the
dissidence
would
kept
down.
and
this
of
course
was
a
hallmark
of
the
stewart's,
now,
the
colonies
when
they
begun
having
their
own
various
states
and
colonies,
had
their
own
individual
types
of
charters
and
constitutions.
four
states
pennsylvania,
vermont,
massachusetts,
and
new
hampshire
made
provisions
for
both
counsel
and
self-representation.
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
was
debated
at
around
the
same
time
of
the
bill
of
rights.
the
judiciary
act
of
1789
gave
both
a
right
to
counsel
and
a
right
to
self-representation.
yet
the
bill
of
rights
of
the
sixth
amendment
gives
no
such
right
of
self
representation
while
giving
a
right
to
counsel.
thus,
it
appears
that
the
framers
purposely
did
not
want
to
make
self
representation
a
constitutional
right.
a
similar
type
of
inference
and
a
similar
type
of
logic
was
made
in
the
case
of
singer
versus
united
states
by
this
court.
well,
the
court
had
held
that
a
right
to
waive
a
jury
does
not
spring
from
the
right
to
a
jury.
and
the
court
stated
“indeed,
if
there
had
been
any
recognition
of
such
a
right,
i.e.
the
right
to
waive
jury,
it
would
be
difficult
to
understand
why
the
sixth
amendment
was
not
drafted
in
terms
as
recognized
an
option.”
380
u.s.
at
31.
thus,
we
submit
the
history
gives
no
right
and
in
fact
the
changes
in
history,
cases
such
as
gideon
and
the
recent
cases
of
sodo
in
the
third
circuit,
and
at
people
versus
sharp
in
our
own
state
--
my
own
state
of
california
seems
to
show
a
greater
reliance
on
the
necessity
of
counsel
and
questions
any
possible
right
of
self-representation
as
being
a
constitutional
right.
due
process
does
not
give
a
right
to
represent
oneself.
rather
it
is
a
right
to
fair
trial.
a
fair
trial
is
fair
if
there
are
fair
and
efficient
court
procedures.
times
had
changed
since
the
last
hundred
years
and
defenses
are
becoming
more
and
more
complex.
it's
no
longer
the
simple
“did
you
do
it?”
a
man
can
shoot
somebody
in
front
of
a
thousand
witnesses
yet
have
a
perfectly
good
defense.
in
california
for
example,
we
have
a
very
complex
defense
known
as
diminished
capacity.
and
this
defense
is
more
or
less
that
of
a
defendant
can
not
attain
a
certain
state
mind
to
commit
a
certain
offense
by
reason
of
mental
deficiency
or
disease
or
intoxication.
he
cannot
be
guilty
of
that
offense
or
that
degree.
now,
it
would
be
almost
impossible
for
a
defendant
in
pro
per
to
raise
this
in
california.
because
one,
he
would
have
another
law
and
the
law
is
very
technical.
two,
you'd
have
to
know
how
to
examine
and
cross-examine
experts.
and
three,
perhaps
most
important
of
all,
he
would
need
to
have
an
objective
understanding
and
appreciation
of
the
applicability
of
the
defense
of
diminished
capacity.
furthermore,
defendant
should
know
--
would
have
to
know
the
complex
motions
to
suppress
by
reason
of
search
and
seizure
and
proper
forms.
also,
a
defendant
could
be
under
drugs
or
withdrawal,
and
by
reason
of
this,
not
be
able
to
defend
himself
properly.
for
example
on
this
particular
case,
the
attorney
for
mr.
faretta
said
that
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
offense
that
the
defendant,
faretta,
was
involved
in
dangerous
drug
activity.
this
is
found
on
page
64
of
the
appendix.
therefore,
because
of
the
defenses
and
because
of
the
mental
problems
that
may
face
the
defendant,
there
would
be
no
right
to
self-representation.
furthermore,
the
law
is
changing
rapidly
and
because
of
these
rapid
changes,
this
would
mandate
the
use
of
counsel.
recently,
this
court
has
come
down
with
the
decisions
of
illinois
versus
allen,
taylor
versus
united
states,
the
former
stating
that
if
the
defendant
becomes
disruptive,
he
could
be
removed
from
the
courtroom,
the
latter
saying
that
if
the
defendant
should
leave
in
the
midst
of
his
trial,
the
trial
can
go
without
him.
if
a
defendant
does
not
have
counsel
and
either
of
the
two
aforementioned
events
takes
place,
the
proceedings
would
unintentionally
become
an
inquisitorial
proceeding
where
no
defense
is
tendered
at
all.
again,
i
would
submit
your
honors
that
due
process
requires
a
fair
trial
and
not
subject
to
whims.
to
say
otherwise
might
encourage
the
cynical
view
that
is
more
important
that
the
accused
believe
that
he
is
getting
justice,
rather
than
actually
get
justice.
fair
as
to
be
meaningful
--
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
you
mean
under
the
constitution
as
to
--
well,
under
california
law
--
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
he
cannot
waive,
that's
correct.
as
to
--
i
know,
well
i
know
no
right
which
is
not
specifically
enumerated
in
the
constitution
which
can
be
to
my
knowledge
constitutionally
waive.
there
have
been
no
cases
as
of
yet
to
my
knowledge.
singer
is
the
perfect
example.
petitioners
pointed
out
that
counsel
in
california
make
binding
decisions,
but
these
decisions
which
he
list
in
his
brief
are
very
complex
indeed,
and
are
in
the
purview
of
a
technician.
thus,
we
need
technical
minds
to
best
direct
that
offense.
the
purpose
of
our
legal
profession,
the
training
involved
is
to
insure
that
trained
individuals
can
be
advocates
in
protecting
the
client's
interests.
now,
petitioners
argued
that
indigents
may
get
a
--
may
not
choose
counsel
in
california
and
may
not
get
along
with
them.
however,
i
think
that
this
can
be
countered
because
first
of
all
the
trial
is
not
a
popularity
contest
to
be
won
by
smiles
and
handshakes,
but
rather
is
a
serious
business
necessitating
the
best
technical
minds
available.
furthermore,
the
defendant
could
possibly
be
a
sociopath
or
mentally
ill
and
not
get
along
with
any
person.
thirdly,
an
attorney
will
have
an
objective
understanding
of
the
case
which
the
defendant
might
not
have
because
of
his
personal
involvement
in
the
charges.
the
purpose
of
due
process
as
supported
by
the
use
of
counsel,
the
court
has
recognize
this
in
such
landmark
cases
as
powell
versus
alabama
and
gideon
versus
wainwright.
again,
as
singer
has
pointed
out,
there
was
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
waiver
and
this
lack
of
a
jury
trial
waiver
did
not
violate
any
constitutional
right
because
the
constitution
guaranteed
the
defendant
a
right
to
jury,
which
was
what
the
defendant
got.
in
the
same
manner,
there's
no
right
to
appear
without
counsel
and
since
the
appellant
--
since
the
petitioner
receives
the
trial
with
counsel,
he
received
what
the
constitution
guaranteed.
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
no.
under
california
law,
the
prosecution
also
has
as
the
right
to
--
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
i
believe
the
court
also.
mr.
howard
j.
schwab
i'm
not
positive
as
to
the
court,
but
i
know
for
sure
the
prosecution
must
also
waive.
petitioners
argued
that
since
there's
a
right
to
counsel,
there
must
be
a
correlative
right
for
self-representation.
as
mentioned
before,
there's
no
historical
source
of
such
a
right.
secondly,
he
mentions
such
cases
as
adams
versus
united
states
ex
rel.
mccann,
which
has
dicta
on
this
point.
however,
these
cases
came
down
before
the
cases
of
gideon
and
of
singer
which
have
supported
the
necessity
of
counsel.
the
singer
doctrine
also
came
down
after
these
opinions
and
thus
because
the
defendant
may
be
able
to
waive
counsel
would
not
mean
that
he
has
a
right
to
waive
counsel
because
as
this
court
said
in
singer
“the
ability
to
waive
a
constitutional
right
does
not
ordinarily
carry
with
it
the
right
to
assist
upon
the
opposite
of
that
right”
380
u.s.
at
3435.
thus,
the
correlative
argument
falls
on
its
face
because
the
constitution
guarantees
a
right
to
a
fair
trial
and
a
right
to
due
process,
and
it
would
be
absurd
to
say
that
there
be
a
correlative
right
to
an
unfair
trial
and
to
a
lack
of
due
process.
thus,
your
honors
in
conclusion,
i
submit
there
is
not
right
to
self-representation
under
the
federal
constitution
or
under
either
a
historical
sixth
amendment
or
due
process
interpretation,
rather
what
is
mandated
is
a
fair
trial.
as
the
trial
court
cautionly
said
in
this
case
to
faretta,
“i
have
seen
more
people
represent
themselves,
convict
themselves
where
if
they
just
sat
down
and
let
somebody
who
knew
what
they
were
doing
do
it
could
well
have
won
the
lawsuit.”
thank
you
your
honors.
