what
was
the
third
one?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
falk,
don't
you
think
the
state
or
the
government
really
has
an
interest
to
see
that
justice
is
done
and
that
is
done
in
a
way
so
convincing
that
it
wins
popular
approval?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
really
doesn't
want
any
lawyer.
he
just
wants
himself
in
the
context
of
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
they
always
want
the
notorious
or
celebrated
ones.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
falk,
we've
showered
you
with
questions
here,
but
i
want
to
be
sure.
do
i
correctly
understand
your
position
to
be
that
if
mr.
faretta
were
permitted
to
represent
himself,
he
would
thereby
no
longer
have
a
claim
later
for
incompetency
of
counsel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
concede
this?
