justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
in
mid
trial
it
would
be
kind
of
hard
to
either
replace
the
man
who
was
assigned
and
it
would
be
kind
of
difficult
to
get
a
new
man
in
on
the
third
day
of
the
trial
who
could
do
much
good,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doesn't
the
state
also
have
an
interest
in
securing
criminal
judgments
against
later
collateral
attack
based
on
a
contention
as
to
whether
the
waiver
of
counsel
was
voluntary
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
a
defendant
who
is
in
the
position
of
your
client
but
at
that
stage
who
says
“i
elect
to
represent
myself”,
would
you
say
that's
--
a
defendant
in
that
position
could
never
later
raise
the
question
of
the
voluntariness
of
his
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
so
the
state
is
solving
that
problem
potential
vulnerability
to
collateral
attack
by
appointing
counsel
for
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
many
lawyers
who
are
willing
to
act
as
standby
counsel
in
that
capacity?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
you
still
got
the
relationship
at
least
when
you're
representing
the
guy,
your
judgment,
your
professional
judgment
is
given
some
weight.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
standby
counsel
is
the
worst
of
both
worlds.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no
problem.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
peculiar
to
the
defendant
do
you
think,
or
don't
think
other
lawyers
may
suffer
the
same
confusion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
knew
the
number
of
peremptories,
didn't
he,
that
you
get?
it
was
--.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh!
well,
the
record
simply
didn't
reveal
that
he
was
wrong,
i
guess
in
--
