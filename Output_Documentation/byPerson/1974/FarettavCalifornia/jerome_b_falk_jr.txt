mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
which
this
case
presents
is
whether
an
indigent
defendant
who
under
controlling
state
law
is
not
free
to
select
the
counsel
of
his
choice,
and
who
must
permit
the
lawyer
appointed
for
him
to
control
presentation
of
his
defense,
whether
such
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
forego
counsel
and
represent
himself.
although
no
holding
of
this
court
squarely
controls
decision,
this
court
has
on
several
occasions
spoken
of
a
right
of
self-representations
in
circumstances
which
fairly
can
be
described
as
considered
dicta.
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
versus
sharp
two
years
ago
decided
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
under
state
or
federal
law
to
representation.
and
this
case
was
decided
pursuant
to
that
controlling
decision.
this
petitioner
was
originally
allowed
by
the
trial
court
to
represent
himself
having
been
quizzed
at
some
length
by
the
trial
judge,
and
found
to
have
voluntarily
and
knowledgeably
waived
his
right
to
counsel.
then
the
sharp
case
intervened
and
some
six
days
later,
the
trial
court
called
petitioner
before
it,
asked
him
a
series
of
questions
not
concerning
--
not
addressed
to
his
waiver,
but
addressed
to
his
ability
to
represent
himself
as
a
defendant
without
a
lawyer.
he
answered
those
questions,
i
would
--
he
answered
them
rather
well
in
most
instances,
but
at
the
conclusion
of
the
colloquy,
the
trial
court
found
him
to
be
inadequately
prepared
to
represent
himself,
and
terminated
his
right
to
represent
himself
and
appointed
the
public
defender.
the
court
of
appeal
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
sharp
and
the
california
supreme
court
denied
a
hearing.
this
case
has
to
be
seen
in
light
of
the
california
law
--
in
three
aspects
of
california
law
which
bear
on
a
defendant
and
his
representation
by
counsel.
in
the
first
place
it
is
clear
that
under
california
law,
a
defendant
who
is
indigent
and
who
seeks
the
appointment
of
counsel
takes
the
lawyer
assigned
to
him
by
the
court
be
he
be
public
defender
or
a
private
attorney.
the
defendant
has
no
right
under
any
circumstances
which
i
know
of,
under
the
cases
to
select
the
lawyer
of
his
choice.
he
may
therefore
get
a
lawyer
who
he
does
not
choose
and
whom
he
may
have
no
confidence.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
your
honor
there
is
not.
and
in
fact
in
none
of
the
three
respects
i'm
about
to
speak
to
is
california
law
unusual,
and
i
ought
to
say
further
that
in
none
of
those
three
respects
do
we
quarrel
with
it
as
applied
to
a
voluntary
attorney-client
relationship.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
your
honor
and
i
perceive
no
constitutional
right
to
pick
ones
own
counsel.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
california
law
in
this
respect.
i
merely
describe
it
because
it
does
bear
on
the
consequences
when
the
defendant
is
unhappy.
the
second
feature
of
california
law
is
that
once
a
lawyer
is
in
the
case,
that
lawyer
runs
the
show.
and
again
i
don't
quarrel
with
this
in
the
normal
voluntary
relationship.
but
the
lawyer
under
california
law
has
the
broadest
powers
with
respect
to
decisions
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
there
are
only
three
exceptions
that
i
know
of.
one
is
the
decision
to
plead
guilty,
second
is
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
have
a
jury,
and
the
third
is
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
testify.
say
for
those
three
exceptions,
the
lawyer
makes
all
decisions.
yes
sir?
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
whether
or
not
to
testify,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
counsel
can
not
keep
his
client
off
the
stand
against
the
client's
desire
to
testify.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
they
are
identical
with
the
aba
standards
mr.
chief
justice
and
i
again
don't
quarrel
with
that.
i
think
a
lawyer
has
to
run
this
show
and
the
consequence
however
is
that
when
the
lawyer
runs
this
show,
he
makes
decisions
for
his
client,
which
directly
affect
constitutional
rights,
whom
to
cross-examine,
whether
or
not
to
call
a
particular
witness,
whether
to
make
a
motion
to
suppress
allegedly
a
legally
obtained
evidence,
whether
to
seek
a
continuance
and
so
forth.
again,
where
the
relationship
is
voluntary,
we
see
no
difficulty
with
it.
finally,
the
third
aspect
of
california
law,
again
one
which
is
not
unusual
is
that
there
is
extremely
limited
appellant
review
of
the
performance
by
a
lawyer.
the
standard
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
it
essentially
boils
down
to
egregious
cases
reducing
the
trial
to
a
farce
or
a
sham.
now,
when
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
are
coerced
in
their
relationship
with
one
another,
then
these
three
concepts
become
manacles
on
the
defendant's
presentation
at
his
defense.
this
is
so
even
if
it
has
an
objective
matter.
the
lawyer
is
a
very
competent
lawyer,
and
i
prepared
to
believe
that
most
are,
california
and
elsewhere.
but
where
the
lawyer
is
less
than
competent
or
where
the
defendant
perceives
him
not
to
be
competent,
the
relationship
becomes
a
terribly
difficult
one.
and
i
have
certainly
no
desire
in
this
case
to
put
the
legal
profession
on
trial,
but
some
realism
has
to
allow
consideration
for
the
fact
that
not
all
lawyers
are
able,
that
there
are
some
lawyers
practicing
criminal
law
in
california
and
elsewhere
who
are
far
less
than
able
and
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
is
true
even
of
retained
counsel.
and
as
i'll
mention
in
a
moment,
one
of
the
interesting
things
is
that
the
california
court
solicited
with
respect
to
a
defendant's
presentation
of
his
defense
that
was
asserted
here
does
not
carry
over
into
the
area
of
retained
counsel.
in
fact
the
california
supreme
court
has
gone
so
far
as
to
hold
in
the
case
called
smith
versus
superior
court
that
a
appointed
lawyer
who
was
found
by
the
trial
court
to
be
incompetent
cannot
be
replaced
over
the
objections
of
the
defendant.
the
california
supreme
court
decided
that
case
in
1968.
it's
still
a
good
law.
of
course
if
the
performance
proves
to
be
incompetent,
there
may
be
a
reversal,
but
the
trial
judge
must
leave
that
relationship
undisturbed
even
if
the
trial
judge
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
the
trial
counsel
is
incompetent.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
have
never
heard
of
them
doing
that
where
there
is
a
lawyer
in
the
case.
they
can
and
do
appoint
standby
counsel
in
cases
where
defendants
seek
to
represent
themselves,
or
at
least
they
did
before
the
sharp
case.
there
have
not
been
many
instances
of
self-representation
since
the
sharp
case
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
the
smith
case
actually
was
a
case
that
had
not
yet
commenced
trial.
it
had
been
a
case
in
which
the
lawyer
--
it
was
a
really
quite
an
extreme
case.
the
lawyer
had
been
appointed
previously,
represented
the
man
on
a
previous
trial,
had
been
reversed,
sent
back.
in
the
meantime
the
lawyer
had
been
found
incompetent
by
a
federal
judge
in
another
case
and
the
judge,
in
the
smith
case,
was
sufficiently
concerned
that
he
inquired
and
replaced
the
trial
counsel
before
trial
started.
california
supreme
court
issued
a
writ
in
that
case
and
ordered
the
trial
court
to
replace
the
original
lawyer,
even
though
the
trial
court
had
found
him
to
be
incompetent.
and
so
the
california
courts
--
the
lesson
from
this
is
that
the
california
supreme
court
and
the
california
courts
intervened
very
little
in
the
presentation
of
a
defense
leaving
that
to
the
defendant
and
his
counsel,
except
in
one
instance
and
that
is
this
instance
where
the
defendant
seeks
not
to
have
a
lawyer.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
the
case
i've
described?
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
this
case,
this
case
had
not
begun
when
this
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no
it
was
at
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
--
at
a
totally
pretrial
stage.
i
recognized
that
the
issue
was
quite
different
when
the
trial
has
begun,
and
that
present
a
very
different
problem
that
is
not
presented
on
this
record.
i
mentioned
all
of
these
aspects
of
california
law
because
they
make
clear
that
compelling
a
client
relationship
does
more
than
the
california
supreme
court
recognized
in
the
sharp
case.
that
is,
it
does
more
than
give
the
defendant
layered
on
to
what
he
had
before.
give
him
more
than
a
benefit
even
though
he
may
not
want
it.
it
takes
something
away
from
him.
it
takes
away
from
him
his
rights
which
we
deemed
to
be
granted
him
by
the
sixth
amendment
to
present
the
defense
as
he
sees
fit.
it's
that
mistake
in
conceiving
of
the
way
the
issues
arise
in
this
case
which
led
not
only
the
california
supreme
court
in
our
opinion,
but
also
quite
recently
the
third
circuit
to
reject
the
right
of
self-representation.
attorney
general
has
sent
to
the
court
a
slip
opinion
of
the
third
circuit
which
follows
although
without
citing,
it
follows
the
sharp
precedent.
it
reasons
as
did
the
california
supreme
court
that
all
that
is
at
stake
here
is
the
right
to
reject
that
which
the
right
to
counsel
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment
grants.
and
thus
it
was
able
to
see
the
case
as
largely
controlled
by
the
singer
case,
in
which
this
court
rejected
the
assertion
that
a
defendant
unilaterally
may
waive
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
there
are
two
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
i
read
it
together
with
the
confrontation
and
cross-examination
clauses
of
the
same
amendment,
which
in
our
view
create
a
right
of
the
defendant
to
present
his
own
defense
as
he
sees
fit.
now,
that
the
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
only
in
the
sense
that
the
defendant
may
elect
not
to
have
that
which
the
--
that
part
of
the
sixth
amendment
allows
him
to
have
if
he
wishes.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
if
it
said
that
mr.
chief
justice,
then
i
take
it
that
trial
courts
would
have
some
discretion.
and
of
course
trial
courts
don't
have
discretion
to
deny
counsel
to
a
defendant
who
wants
it.
i
think
that
drafting
it
that
way
would've
left
that
kind
of
discretion
in
the
trial
courts
and
the
framers
surely
didn't
intend
that.
i
really
need
to
elaborate,
i
think,
on
the
point
i
left
hanging
a
moment
ago
which
is
how
we
see
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
present
his
defense
in
the
confrontation
and
cross-examination
clauses.
the
attorney
general's
position
with
respect
to
that
is
that
the
right
to
present
a
defense,
the
right
to
confront,
the
right
to
cross-examine
is
a
right
that
can
be
exercised
for
a
defendant
by
an
agent,
by
a
lawyer.
if
that
were
so,
then
the
right
to
be
present,
which
this
court
held
on
--
has
held
on
many
occasions
to
be
a
part
of
due
process
and
part
of
the
sixth
amendment,
would
not
derive
from
the
sixth
amendment
because
a
defendant
could
confront
his
accusers
and
cross-examine
through
a
lawyer.
but
the
court
held
in
illinois
versus
allen
following
a
long
line
of
cases,
the
sixth
amendment
gives
the
defendant
the
right
to
be
present.
and
then
i
think
probably
--probably
with
some
qualifications?
with
some
qualifications.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
it's
a
right
that
can
be
lost
by
misconduct,
and
we,
i
should
say
so
i'm
clear
on
that
point.
we
quite
agree
that
a
defendant
who
waives
his
right
to
--
you
know,
a
defendant
may
waive
his
right
to
represent
himself
in
the
same
way
by
misconduct
maybe
taken
away
from
him
just
as
it
was
in
illinois
versus
allen.
i
should
also
say
that
this
defendant
was
entirely
respectful
on
the
record.
there
was
not
any
instance
of
that
in
this
case,
nor
in
any
of
the
76
other
reported
appellate
cases
involving
the
right
of
self-representation
in
california
which
we've
collected
in
appendix
to
our
brief.
that
kind
of
outrageous
conduct
that
the
courts
in
illinois
versus
allen
and
in
mayberry
versus
pennsylvania
is
a
rarity.
but
in
the
right
to
be
present
cases,
the
court
has
seen
the
right
of
self-representation
as
involved.
in
snyder
versus
massachusetts,
the
court
explained
the
right
to
be
present,
as
deriving
from
the
defendants
right
and
i
quote
“to
give
advice
or
suggestions
or
even
to
supersede
his
lawyers
altogether
and
conduct
the
trial
himself.”
so
that
is
part
of
why
we
see
the
singer
case
is
not
controlling
because
singer
involved
simply
the
right
to
reject
a
protection
of
the
constitution.
and
this
involves
another
part
of
the
constitution,
a
right
to
present
a
defense,
but
there's
another
reason
too
why
singer
doesn't
control
here.
the
singer
case
was
a
case
where
the
court
properly
recognized
that
the
government
as
a
litigant,
and
use
those
exact
words
“the
government
as
a
litigant”,
has
an
interest
in
seeing
a
particular
kind
of
fact
finder
or
jury.
here
the
government
as
a
litigant
is
neutral.
it
has
no
interest
in
seeing
who
the
--
how
the
defendant
present
his
defense
or
who
represents
him.
and
the
government,
the
prosecutor
in
this
case,
made
no
objection
when
the
defendant
sought
to
represent
himself.
he
took
no
position.
he
saw
himself
as
neutral
on
that
issue.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
think
not
and
--
but
in
a
different
kind
of
case
which
i'm
trying
to
distinguish,
they
should.
that
is
where
the
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
have
heard
of
prosecutors
speak
both
sides
on
that.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
the
proper
answer
is
the
one
i
think
implied
in
your
question.
it's
not
the
prosecutor's
affair,
and
that's
precisely
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
which
is
that
unlike
singer
where
the
prosecutor
had
a
legitimate
interest
as
a
litigant
in
a
particular
kind
of
fact
finder,
prosecutor
was
neutral
here.
it
is
also
not
true
that
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
do
think
so
mr.
justice
blackmun.
but
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
chaining
a
defendant
to
a
lawyer
he
doesn't
want
is
not
the
way
to
accomplish
that.
now
i
know
that
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
--
well,
in
this
case
he
would
have.
i
don't
believe
it
shown
by
the
record.
there
was
a
private
lawyer
he
would've
accepted
but
it
wasn't
within
his
ability
to
have
that
lawyer.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
this
one
happened
not
to
be
the
case.
this
one
happened
to
be
a
relatively
obscure
and
perfectly
competent
lawyer
who
couldn't
work
for
free,
and
that's
just
how
it
happens.
it's
quite
true
that
that
at
sometimes
is
the
case.
but
what
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
does.
and
the
position
that
we
take
here
on
that
point
is
that
the
defendant
is
bound
by
what
happens
at
his
trial.
his
waiver
comes
at
the
point
in
which
he
elects
knowledgeably
to
forego
an
opportunity
he
had
to
have
counsel,
and
to
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
oh!
no.
he
may
certainly
can
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
that
is
in
my
view
a
pretty
weak
basis
in
which
to
deny
somebody
if
that
were
the
only
interest
at
stake,
his
opportunity
to
present
his
own
defense.
it
certainly
has
the
right,
the
court
certainly
has
the
right
and
i
think
the
duty
to
question
the
defendant
very
carefully
as
to
the
state
of
his
knowledge
and
understanding
at
the
time
he
makes
his
decision.
we
set
out
an
appendix,
a
very
excellent
model
colloquy
prepared
by
judge
ely
in
an
opinion
hodge
case.
if
that
is
done
and
the
defendant
adheres
to
the
position
that
he
wants
to
represent
himself,
he's
bound
by
that
decision.
the
court
can
protect
itself
by
an
adequate
colloquy,
indeed
the
one
in
this
case
and
by
the
trial
judge
on
the
first
instance.
i
think
would
have
survived
any
kind
of
scrutiny.
it
was
a
very
careful
good
job
of
seeing
that
the
defendant
knew
what
he
was
doing,
and
the
judge
said
to
him
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
only
in
the
sense
that
he
has
to
understand
that
the
trial
judge
thinks
he's
making
a
terrible
mistake.
he
does
not
have
to
understand
in
order
to
make
an
intelligent
waiver.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i'm
having
difficulty
with
the
words,
but
i
think
that
is
the
proper
conclusion.
i
--
let
me
put
it,
if
i
may
slightly
different
way.
he
does
not
have
to
show
that
he
will
do
a
good
job
as
a
competent
self
representer
if
you
will.
if
that
test
gets
applied,
then
as
most
of
the
courts
that
have
considered
the
matter
recognized
there
will
be
very,
very
few
instances
in
which
defendants
will
satisfy
a
skeptical
trial
judge
that
he's
going
to
do
as
good
a
job
as
a
lawyer.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
that
the
question
is
one
that
has
there
otherwise
of
dealing
with.
that
is,
i
presume
there
are
ways
of
bridging
the
communications
problem
with
the
defendant.
he's
going
to
have
the
same
problem
with
a
lawyer,
i
suppose.
the
problem,
if
i
may
turn
the
facts
around,
the
real
problem
comes
frequently
where
the
defendant
is
just
not
as
good
as
the
judge
would
like
him
to
be
and
in
terms
of
understanding
legal
issues.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
not,
because
of
the
difference
between
the
prosecutor's
interest
in
having
a
jury
trial,
and
the
prosecutor's
lack
of
interest
in
seeing
that
the
defendant
has
a
particular
type
of
defense.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
a
whole
series
of
questions
i
think
all
touch
on
the
very
problem
of
the
inadequate
defendant.
he's
made
an
intelligent
waiver
in
the
sense
that
he
understood
what
he
did,
but
he's
not
intelligent
about
being
a
lawyer.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
to
that
has
to
be
presented
at
two
levels,
philosophical
and
practical.
at
the
philosophical
level,
i
think
we
have
to
conclude
that
constitutional
rights
are
not
dependent
for
their
existence
on
the
ability
of
a
person
who
owns
them
has
them
to
exercise
them
intelligently
or
well.
right
of
free
speech
can
be
exercised
by
another
fool
as
cases
like
cohen
versus
california,
and
many
others
demonstrate.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
i
think
is
not
a
question.
the
court
may
ask
it
but
the
--
and
it
probably
ought
to
ask
questions
like
that
to
see
if
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall
i
agree
with
you,
and
i
think
we
have
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
absolutely
not.
i
quite
agree
that
that's
what
the
trial
judge
should
do.
that's
what
the
aba
standards
committee
thought
the
judge
ought
to
do.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
would
not
object
to
that.
but
the
difference
is
--
the
difference
is
that
that
lawyer
is
there
to
provide
such
assistance
as
the
defendant
wants.
he'll
answer
questions.
he
may
even
volunteer
a
little
advice,
but
he
doesn't
present
evidence.
he
doesn't
prevent
the
defendant
from
presenting
evidence.
that's
the
key,
you
see,
the
lawyer
in
california
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
i'm
sorry.
the
key
to
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well
i
understand
that
mr.
justice.
i
meant
by
that
the
key
to
the
problem
in
california.
the
problem
in
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
understand.
in
california,
the
defendant
is
precluded
by
the
trial
judge
--
by
the
trial
counsel
from
presenting
evidence
if
the
trial
counsel
doesn't
want
him
to,
he's
precluded
from
cross-examining
if
the
trial
counsel
doesn't
want
him
to.
and
that's
the
problem
to
which
i
address
myself.
and
the
difference
between
the
appointment
of
counsel
and
the
standby
counsel,
which
the
aba
thinks
is
the
way
to
solve
the
problem,
is
that
the
standby
counsel
doesn't
interfere
in
those
kinds
of
decisions.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
that
the
right
to
counsel
and
the
right
to
present
one's
own
defense
are
necessarily
mutually
exclusive.
i
--
this
is
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
this
defendant
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
my
client's
position
is
simply
he
wanted
to
it
alone.
he
didn't
care
to
have
a
standby
counsel.
if
a
defendant
wanted
a
standby
counsel,
i'm
not
sure
that
he
is
in
constitutionally
entitled.
i
recognized
the
issue
isn't
presented
here.
but
the
reason
that
i
say
that
is
that
the
sixth
amendment
clauses
that
are
part
of
this
case
can
be
--
are
not
mutually
exclusive.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes,
it
may.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
it
may.
i
see
no
right
not
to
have
a
standby
counsel.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
interferes
with
the
sixth
amendment
right
that
someone
sitting
his
side
and
can
--
and
doesn't
interfere
with
him
and
i
see
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
but
not
in
the
way
that
a
lawyer
is
being
foisted
upon
defendant
such
as
faretta.
and
i
see
no
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
exactly
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
he's
there
but
he
provides
no
assistance
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
we
have
not
gone
that
far,
and
i
think
that's
an
open
question.
i
think
that
that
standby
counsel
alternative
plus
the
power
of
the
trial
judge
to
run
his
courtroom
provides
a
very
adequate
answer
to
the
problem
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
raised
early
on,
which
is
the
problem
of
the
inadequate
defendant
and
the
need
of
the
courts
to
see
that
everybody
gets
a
fair
trial.
that
bridges
the
gap.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
have
to
say
candidly
that
i
think
an
argument
can
be
made
that
a
defendant
who
chooses
to
exercise
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
present
a
defense,
is
also
entitled
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
of
a
standby
nature.
you
can
read
those
clauses
textually
to
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i'm
answering
a
question
candidly,
but
i
didn't
--
couldn't
raise
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
didn't
reach
it
in
the
brief
because
the
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i'm
not
claiming
it
on
behalf
of
this
petitioner
because
i
don't
have
to.
the
problem
isn't
raised
by
his
case.
he
didn't
ask
for
that.
i
did
not
--
i'm
quite
sure
mr.
justice,
i
did
not
disclaim
that
position
because
it
was
in
my
mind
that
the
two
can
be
read
consistently
in
that
way.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
so
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that's
why
i've
answered
the
questions
i
had.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
there
are
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
they
indicate
though
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
standby
counsel
is
not
to
ask
questions
and
to
introduce
evidence
and
not
--
and
has
no
power
to
preclude
the
defendant
from
doing
so.
so
in
those
respect,
he
is
not
able
to
interfere
with
the
defendant's
sixth
amendment
rights
to
present
his
defense.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
would
think
that
there
are
as
many
lawyers
who
are
willing
to
do
that
as
who
are
willing
to
endure
the
awful
relationship
of
a
--
having
with
a
client
who
doesn't
want
them.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
i
--
this
is
a
personal
answer.
i
have
no
statistics
for
you.
my
personal
reaction
is
quite
the
opposite.
i
would
prefer
-
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
would
prefer
to
serve
as
a
standby
counsel
and
those
lawyers
who
have
had
an
opportunity
to
question
on
it
share
the
same
view.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that's
what
i
was
talking
about.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that's
right,
that's
in
the
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
yes
that
is
clear
at
my
position.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
concede
it.
and
i
concede
further
that
he
would
not
have
the
right
to
any
advantage
over
the
position
of
a
defendant
would
be
who
had
a
lawyer.
any
claim
that
should've
been
raised
at
trial
wasn't
to
preclude
it
in
the
same
way.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
i
think
it
will
because
it
is
the
logical
consequence
of
everything
that
has
been
said
on
the
right
of
self-representation.
anything
else
makes
the
right.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
no,
not
a
faulty
waiver.
i
think
it
has
to
be
able
to
look
at
that
in
the
same
way
that
it
can
look
at
a
guilty
plea.
but
beyond
that
i
believe
it
will
not
allow
a
defendant
to
profit
from
his
decision
to
represent
himself
and
what
not
to.
thank
you.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
is
a
finding
i
must
respectfully
say,
which
is
supported
by
no
evidence
in
the
record
because
the
colloquy
upon
which
that
finding
was
based
did
not
examine
the
question
of
the
defendant's
knowledge
with
respect
to
the
waiver.
it
did
not
go
over
the
same
ground
that
the
original
judge
had
covered.
he
asked
only
questions
about
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
conduct
the
trial.
that's
all
that
that
judge
inquired
of.
it
was
a
different
judge
who
handled
--
who
took
the
waiver
in
the
first
place.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
well,
that's
a
question
of
constitutional
fact
which
i
think
this
court
must
make
an
independent
judgment.
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
under
the
california
rule
of
the
sharp
case
and
earlier
cases
--
mr.
jerome
b.
falk,
jr.
that
that
is
a
sort
of
a
substantial
evidence
rule
the
court
yielded
to
what
it
called
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court
in
that
regard.
