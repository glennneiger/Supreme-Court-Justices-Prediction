that's
true
even
of
retained
counsel,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
ask
you
mr.
falk?
by
rule
of
court,
for
example
statute
assuming
your
position
for
bail
that
he's
entitled
to
run
his
own
show,
may
the
court
say
“but,
we're
going
to
appoint
a
standby
counsel.”
if
he
objects?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
the
limitation
then
on
the
sixth
amendment
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
standby
counsel
is
being
foisted
on
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
standby
counsel
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
run
the
show.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
mr.
falk,
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart
means
counsel
--
court
says
“alright,
go
ahead
defend
yourself.”
he
said
“well,
i'd
like
to
have
counsel
sit
behind
me
to
help
me
if
i
need
him.”
“you
want
to
run
your
own
show,
you
run
it.
i'm
not
going
to
appoint
him.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
other
side
discussed
history
and
come
up
with
the
opposite
result.
let
me
ask
this,
your
statement
about
constitutional
right
is
out
of
line
apparently
with
the
policy
in
36
states
that
mr.
falk
has
set
forth
in
his
brief
which
have
constitutional
rights
under
the
state
constitutions.
do
you
think
this
is
bad
policy,
is
this
what
you're
arguing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
federal
constitutional
right.
