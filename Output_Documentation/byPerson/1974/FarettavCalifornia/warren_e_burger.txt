chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
73-5772,
faretta
against
california.
mr.
falk
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
--
would
you
think
there
was
anything
unusual
about
people
of
modest
means
and
not
always
getting
the
lawyer
they
would
like
to
have?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
those
standards,
they're
consistent
of
the
standards
established
by
the
american
bar
and
criminal
justice
project,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the,
under
the
california
judges,
ever
in
that
situation
apply
it
to
yet
another
lawyer
to
act
as
a
friend
of
the
court
and
assist?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
days
have
this
trial
gone
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
part
of
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
case
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
read
the
sixth
amendment
language
as
mandatory.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
read
the
“shall”
in
the
first
line
of
the
sixth
amendment
as
being
by
clear
implication
part
of
the
last
phrase,
“and
shall
have
the
right
to
assistance
of
counsel.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
read
“shall
have”
out
of
the
sixth
amendment.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
easier
to
follow
if
the
sixth
amendment
read
“may
have
the
assistance
of
counsel”
would
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
would
you
think
to
the
courts
should
give
controlling
or
even
very
much
weight
to
what
the
prosecutor
thinks
about
that
subject?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
prosecutor
might
be
overjoyed
as
having
a
defendant
waive
counsel,
might
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
said
might.
it
would
depend
on
the
circumstances.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
take
an
extreme
example,
obviously
extreme.
the
defendant
is
a
highly
intelligent
deaf-mute.
in
writing,
he
communicates
or
through
other
methods
with
the
judge,
is
sufficiently
to
show
that
it
is
a
voluntary
waiver
of
counsel.
do
you
think
the
constitution
requires
the
court
to
go
ahead
and
have
this
deaf-mute
undertake
to
defend
himself?
just
because
he
satisfied
that
it's
voluntary
and
that
the
man
is
a
very
intelligent
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
going
to
the
waivers
of
some
of
these
constitutional
provisions.
in
many
of
the
states
as
in
federal
statutes,
when
a
defendant
seeks
to
waive
trial
by
jury,
he
is
not
permitted
to
do
so
unless
the
prosecutor
consents
and
unless
the
judge
consents.
all
three
participants
must
consent
or
it
can't
be
done.
does
that
policy
suggest
something
about
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
it
not
go
to
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
intimating
that
the
state
has
such
a
strong
interest
in
a
proper
trial
that
it
sets
up
these
additional
safeguards
over
and
above
the
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you'd
be
willing
to
concede
that
we
must
consider
that
aspect
whether
you
press
it
on
us
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
take
it
you're
aware
that
in
most
cases
when
a
judge
appoints
standby
counsel,
that
standby
counsel
is
instructed
to
do
everything
that
he
would
do
if
he
were
retained
the
counsel,
whether
the
defendant
likes
it
or
whether
the
defendant
does
not
like
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
the
standards
of
the
american
bar
reflect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
courts,
the
trial
court,
the
presiding
judge
or
an
appellate
court
is
going
to
consider
itself
bound
by
that
kind
of
proposition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
we
concede
your
premise
is
the
logical
consequence,
but
you
don't
really
think
that
an
appellate
court
would
refuse
to
examine
a
claim
to
a
faulty
waiver
by
a
defendant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
falk.
mr.
schwab.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
california,
may
a
defendant
unilaterally
waive
trial
by
jury
without
the
consent
of
the
court
for
prosecution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court,
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
same
as
the
federal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.

time
is
up
