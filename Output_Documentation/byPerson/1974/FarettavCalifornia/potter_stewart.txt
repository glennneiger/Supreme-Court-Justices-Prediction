nothing
unusual
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understood
in
your
brief,
is
there
constitutionally
only
to
the
extent
that
the
man,
the
defendant
himself
wants
to
consult
him
and
use
him?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
and
if
i
further
understood
your
brief,
you
do
not
say
that
the
constitution
requires
any
such
standby
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
now
departing
from
your
brief
very
explicitly.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
running
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
covered
it.
you
dealt
with
it
explicitly.
you
said
you're
not
claiming
that.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
just
before
you
sit
down
mr.
falk,
the
trial
court
purported
the
find
that
your
client,
your
present
client,
the
defendant
did
not
make
an
intelligent
and
knowing
waiver
from
his
constitutional
right
to
be
represented
by
an
attorney.
now
that's
the
posture,
i
mean
that's
the
focal
one
which
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
has
decided.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
was
the
finding?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
did
the
appellate
court
do
with
that,
did
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
right
to
trial
by
jury
under
the
singer
case,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
the
first
of
these
cases,
faretta
against
the
state
of
california
is
here
by
way
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
for
the
second
appellate
district.
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
our
constitution
guarantee
that
a
person
brought
to
trial
in
any
state
or
federal
court
must
be
afforded
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
before
he
can
be
validly
convicted
and
punished
by
imprisonment.
the
question
before
us
in
the
present
case
is
whether
a
defendant
in
a
state
criminal
trial
has
a
constitutional
right
to
proceed
without
counsel
when
he
voluntarily
and
intelligently
elects
to
do
so.
stated
another
way,
the
question
is
whether
a
state
may
constitutionally
hale
a
person
into
its
criminal
courts
and
there
force
a
lawyer
upon
him,
even
when
he
insists
that
he
wants
to
conduct
his
own
defense.
it
is
not
an
easy
question.
anthony
faretta
was
charged
with
grand
theft
in
an
information
filed
in
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county,
california.
at
the
arraignment,
the
judge
assigned
to
preside
at
the
trial
appointed
the
public
defender
to
represent
faretta.
well
before
the
date
of
trial,
however,
faretta
requested
that
he
be
permitted
to
represent
himself.
in
accordance
with
a
then
recent
california
supreme
court
decision,
the
judge
ruled
that
faretta
had
constitutional
right
to
conduct
his
own
defense.
throughout
the
subsequent
trial,
the
judge
required
that
faretta's
defense
be
conducted
only
through
the
appointed
lawyer
from
the
public
defender's
office.
at
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
jury
found
faretta
guilty
as
charged,
and
the
judge
sentenced
him
to
prison.
the
california
court
of
appeal,
affirmed
the
trial
judge's
ruling
that
faretta
had
no
federal
or
state
constitutional
right
to
represent
himself.
accordingly,
the
appellate
court
affirmed
faretta's
conviction.
the
california
supreme
court
denied
review.
and
we
granted
certiorari.
in
a
rather
lengthy
written
opinion
filed
today,
we
review
the
previous
dicta
of
this
court
concerning
the
question
now
before
us.
the
decisions
of
state
courts
and
federal
court
of
appeals,
the
structure
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
english
and
colonial
legal
history
from
which
that
amendment
emerged.
this
review
leads
we
think
inexorably
to
the
conclusion
that
under
our
constitution,
a
person
does
have
a
right
to
conduct
his
own
defense
in
a
state
criminal
trial
if
he
insist
upon
doing
so.
it
is
worth
noting
that
in
the
long
history
of
british,
colonial,
and
american
criminal
law,
there
was
only
one
tribunal
that
ever
adopted
the
practice
of
forcing
a
lawyer
upon
an
unwilling
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
that
tribunal
was
the
star
chamber.
there
can
be
no
blinking
the
fact
that
the
right
of
an
accused
to
conduct
his
own
defense
seems
to
cut
against
the
grain
of
this
court's
decisions
holding
that
the
constitution
requires
that
no
accused
can
be
convicted
and
imprisoned
unless
he
has
been
accorded
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
for
it
is
surely
true
that
the
basic
thesis
of
those
decisions
is
that
the
help
of
a
lawyer
is
essential
to
assure
the
defendant
a
fair
trial.
and
a
strong
argument
can
surely
be
made
that
the
whole
thrust
of
those
decisions
must
inevitably
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
a
state
may
constitutionally
impose
a
lawyer
upon
even
an
unwilling
defendant.
but
it
is
one
thing
to
hold
that
every
defendant,
rich
or
poor,
has
the
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel,
and
quite
another
to
say
that
a
state
may
compel
a
defendant
to
accept
a
lawyer
he
does
not
want.
the
value
of
state-appointed
counsel
was
not
unappreciated
by
the
founders,
yet
the
notion
of
compulsory
counsel
was
utterly
foreign
to
them.
and
whatever
else
may
be
said
of
those
who
wrote
the
bill
of
rights,
surely
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
understood
the
inestimable
worth
of
free
choice.
it
is
undeniable
that
in
most
criminal
prosecutions
defendants
could
better
defend
with
counsel's
guidance
than
by
their
own
unskilled
efforts.
but
where
the
defendant
will
not
voluntarily
accept
representation
by
counsel,
the
potential
advantage
of
a
lawyer's
training
and
experience
can
be
realized,
if
at
all,
only
imperfectly.
to
force
a
lawyer
on
a
defendant
can
only
lead
him
to
believe
that
the
law
contrives
against
him.
moreover,
it
is
not
inconceivable
that
in
some
rare
instances,
the
defendant
might
in
fact
present
his
case
more
effectively
by
conducting
his
own
defense.
personal
liberties
are
not
rooted
in
the
law
of
averages.
the
right
to
defend
is
personal.
the
defendant,
and
not
his
lawyer
or
the
state,
will
bear
the
personal
consequences
of
a
conviction.
it
is
the
defendant,
therefore,
who
must
be
free
personally
to
decide
whether
in
his
particular
case
counsel
is
to
his
advantage.
and
although
he
may
conduct
his
own
defense
ultimately
to
his
own
detriment,
his
choice
must
be
honored
out
of
that
respect
for
the
individual
which
is
the
lifeblood
of
the
law.
in
this
case,
weeks
before
trial,
faretta
clearly
and
unequivocally
declared
to
the
trial
judge
that
he
wanted
to
represent
himself
and
that
he
did
not
want
a
lawyer
to
help
him.
the
record
affirmatively
shows
that
faretta
was
literate,
competent,
and
understanding
and
that
he
was
voluntarily
exercising
his
informed
free
will.
we
hold
that
in
forcing
faretta
under
these
circumstances
to
accept
against
his
will
a
state
appointed
public
defender,
the
california
courts
deprived
him
of
his
constitutional
right
to
conduct
his
own
defense.
accordingly,
the
judgment
before
us
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
written
opinion
of
the
court
filed
with
the
clerk
this
morning.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
have
joined.
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
