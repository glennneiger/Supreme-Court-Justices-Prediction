what
if
the
judge
asked
him
all
the
questions
that
you
suggest
he
asked
him
and
a
lot
more
too,
and
becomes
convinced
that
he
really
is
quite
incompetent
to
conduct
his
own
defense.
and
then
concludes
that
his
waiver
can
not
possibly
be
intelligent,
it
might
be
quite
voluntary
but
it
isn't
intelligent?
justice
byron

and
i
suppose
you
would
suggest
that
the
waiver
must
be
intelligent
as
well
as
voluntary?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron

so
you
say
your
answer
is
“no,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
intelligent.
it
only
has
to
be
voluntary?”
justice
byron
r.
white
you
ask
him
a
series
of
questions.
does
he
understand
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer?
he
answers
“yes.”
does
he
understand
that
the
court
thinks
he's
got
a
very
complicated
case
here,
the
court
thinks
he's
very
ill-advised
that
a
lawyer
can
do
a
better
job
for
him,
the
court
seen
many
such
cases,
does
he
understand
that?
the
court
wants
him
to
have
a
lawyer,
does
he
understand
that?
he
answers
the
questions
of
that
kind
all
the
way
to
“does
he
understand
what
the”

but
you
wouldn't
require
the
appointment
of
standby
counsel,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
waive
it,
you
waive
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it
is.
it
might
not
enough.
it
might
not
be
the
final
answer
if
he
just
says
“i
waive.
i
understand
judge.
i'm
doing
myself
a
terrible
service.”
but
you're
really
suggesting
then
that
he
should
say
to
the
judge
“i
want
to
run
this
trial.
you
must
appoint
me
a
counsel
to
help
me,
but
i'm
running
the
show.”
justice
byron
r.

is
that
the
limit
of
his
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
really
so
serious,
the
court
can
straighten
him
out
easily
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
we
met
records
up
here
with
retain
counsel
with
complain
they
weren't
advised
or
something
of
the
peremptories
they
were
entitled
to
in
a
joint
trial
for
instance.

the
record
represented
himself
