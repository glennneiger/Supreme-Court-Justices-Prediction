we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
cantrell
against
forest
city
publishing.
mr.
sherman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
while
you
are
pausing
here
for
a
moment
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
is
there
not
a
some
kind
of
the
â€“
or
is
there
some
kind
of
a
public
interest
in
the
consequences
of
a
great
tragedy
of
this
kind,
46
people
killed.
it
might
in
turn
have
an
impact
on
legislature,
governors,
mayors;
everyone
else
to
see
that
old
bridges
are
replaced
for
example
and/or
kept
in
repairs
so
that
these
tragedies
aren't
repeated.
is
that
in
here
somewhere?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
they
not
remembered
perhaps
a
little
more
if
someone
writes
about
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
then
that
defense
if
you
could
call
it
that
didn't
seem
to
have
much
impact
on
the
juries,
so
it
isn't
the
factor
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
sherman.
mr.
warder?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
why
did
he
got
to
go
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
gertz
really
had
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
this
is
a
privacy
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
parsing
it
pretty
finely
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you're
talking
for
a
lay
person
who
is
not
well
educated.
i
submit
that
it's
pretty
difficult
for
me
to
understand
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
haven't
you
postulated
a
subjective
test
there,
some
things
would
ring
a
bell
with
some
editors
and
the
other
editors
wouldn't
hear
any
bell
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
that's
what
you
meant
when
you
said
the
editors
reads
it
that
is
peril?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
he's
got
to
wait
and
see
what
the
jury
and
what
ultimately
this
court
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
isn't
this
the
case
sounding
in
violation
of
privacy
in
the
nature
of
trespass
concept
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
you
trespass
on
the
person's
privacy
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
her
whole
complaint
here
is
that
your
client
trespassed
on
her
privacy,
in
her
household,
in
her
family,
in
her
tragedy,
that's
the
essence
of
it,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
trespassed
and
then
published
the
results
of
what
you
found
or
thought
you
found.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
sherman,
you
have
used
all
your
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
become
a
burden
after
the
jury
has
returned
the
verdict
and
to
loose
instructions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
in
no.
