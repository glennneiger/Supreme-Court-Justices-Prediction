mr.
warder,
i
have
problem.
this
material
was
gained
by
a
trespass,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
wasn't
a
trespass
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
was
this
a
state
trespass
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
the
licensee
when
the
mother
wasn't
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
couldn't
give
license.
justice
thurgood
marshall
children
could
give
license?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
two-year
old?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
law
of
kentucky?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
she
can
give
license?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
thought
the
child
said
deliberately
that
mother
is
not
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
contend
that
as
saying
that
the
licensee
is
not
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
licensor
is
not
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
just
said,
but
why
did
they
say
the
mother
was
not
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don't
think
that
was
a
trespass?
