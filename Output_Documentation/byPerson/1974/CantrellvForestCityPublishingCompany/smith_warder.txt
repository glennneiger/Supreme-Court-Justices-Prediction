mr.
smith
warder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
passage
that
the
court
wants
is
found
on
page
60
of
the
appendix
where
the
trial
court
finds
there
has
been
no
evidence
in
support
of
the
charges
that
the
invasion
of
privacy
if
in
fact
an
invasion
of
privacy
occurred
was
done
maliciously
within
the
legal
definition
of
that
term.
mr.
smith
warder
page
60
of
the
appendix,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
smith
warder
at
the
close
of
the
blamos
case
and
that's
where
the
court
throughout
the
claim
of
punitive
or
exemplary
damages
because
of
the
absence
of
malice
under
the
time
inc.
standard,
but
erroneously
send
it
to
the
jury
on
compensatory
damages.
mr.
smith
warder
in
the
context
if
you
read
the
record,
this
is
the
only
malice
we
were
discussing.
we
never
even
discussed
the
common
law
standard
of
malice.
all
we
discussed
was
--
mr.
smith
warder
your
honor,
if
you
will
compare
this
court's
definition
of
malice
in
the
charge
he
gave
the
jury
with
this
statement,
i
think
it
will
become
apparent
that
he
was
not
talking
common
law
matters.
he
just
was
it
--
mr.
smith
warder
he
mistakenly
felt
--
mr.
smith
warder
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
smith
warder
it
should
have
been
and
that's
what
the
court
held
--
mr.
smith
warder
we
moved
for
directed
verdict
and
we
renewed
it.
mr.
smith
warder
no.
he
overruled
it
in
its
entirety
your
honor.
remember
your
honor,
at
this
--
mr.
smith
warder
on
compensatory
damages,
of
course
he
did.
mr.
smith
warder
but
this
is
the
confusion
that
was
in
the
trial
court's
mind.
now
if
i
can
get
back
to
your
honor's
question,
i'm
a
trial
advocate.
i
am
faced
with
the
proposition.
if
the
court
says
i
am
going
to
the
jury
on
compensatory
damages,
i
submit
it
is
most
dangerous
not
to
put
in
a
defense
because
i'm
going
to
that
jury
anyway.
mr.
smith
warder
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
in
all
fairness.
mr.
smith
warder
in
generally,
yes
your
honor
as
i
shall
come
to
that.
remember
despite
the
protestation
of
my
learned
opponent,
this
is
a
post
like
privacy
case.
on
page
35
of
the
record,
the
petitioner
admitted
that
she
was
not
offended
by
the
existence
of
publicity,
but
by
it's
nature
and
if
you
will
read
the
question
preceding
the
excerpt
which
my
opponent
read,
this
becomes
perfectly
clear.
now
--
mr.
smith
warder
no.
there
are
four
--
mr.
smith
warder
well,
that's
the
project
from
the
other
way
your
honor.
it's
not
a
commercial
exploitation
case.
it
is
not
a
case
of
the
disclosure
of
embarrassing
private
facts.
neither
is
it
a
case
of
an
unwarranted
intrusion.
now,
there
are
only
four
types
of
privacy,
and
this
is
all
that
remains,
it
has
to
be.
for
that
matter,
commercial
exploitation
as
i
understand
it
was
a
laid
to
rest
with
this
court’s
decision
in
the
pittsburgh
press
case,
but
this
is
a
privacy
case
which
had
it
been
brought
as
a
libel
case
would
not
have
gone
to
the
jury
because
it
is
not
libelous
per
se
then
there
is
no
proof
of
special
damages
as
is
required
in
a
per
code
libel
case.
now
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
compare
the
state
of
the
law
in
right
of
privacy
in
the
libel
and
slander.
in
the
right
of
privacy
case,
truth
is
not
a
defense,
in
a
libel
case,
it
is.
at
common
law
in
the
privacy
case,
it
is
a
complete
defense
that
common
law
if
the
matter
is
one
of
public
interest.
mr.
smith
warder
that
was
dismissed
and
abandoned.
it
just
never
went
to
the
jury.
it
was
tried
on
a
simple
privacy
theory
and
counsel
admitted
that
it
his
opening
argument.
mr.
smith
warder
that's
the
only
one.
mr.
smith
warder
now
--
mr.
smith
warder
right.
mr.
smith
warder
yes
it
is.
mr.
smith
warder
now,
in
a
libel
case
in
the
light
of
gertz,
i
have
some
doubts
and
so
does
the
verdict
lodged
in
the
courts
as
to
whether
being
a
matter
of
public
interest
is
any
longer
defense
when
we
are
discussing
private
persons.
now,
let's
see
where
this
diagrams
out
as
to
privacy
and
libel.
if
there
is
a
matter
of
public
interest
involved
and
if
it
be
true,
plaintiff
can
recover
under
either
theory,
but
if
it
is
not
a
matter
of
public
interest
and
if
it
is
false,
if
it's
defamatory,
then
you
can
recover
in
the
libel.
if
it
is
non-defamatory,
then
you
can
still
recover
in
a
privacy
action.
now
somehow
here
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
narrow
context,
freedom
of
the
press
just
does
not
exist.
going
further,
if
it's
a
matter
of
public
interest
and
false,
you
can
recover
in
libel
but
as
i
understand
gertz,
only
if
it
is
defamatory
on
its
face.
and
finally,
if
it's
not
a
matter
of
public
interest
and
if
it's
true,
you
can
still
recover
in
a
privacy
action.
now,
there
is
something
wrong
here
and
it
seems
to
me
the
touchstone
is
if
i
am
sitting
at
the
editor’s
desk,
if
there
is
something
in
this
article
that
rings
the
alarm
that
tells
me
this
article
has
a
propensity
to
offend,
then
perhaps
i'd
publish
at
my
peril
and
i
think
i
should.
but
if
i
read
an
article
that
rings
no
alarm
that
carries
with
it
no
warning,
if
thereafter
some
jury
is
to
tell
me
i
owe
damages,
i
have
become
libel
without
probable
--
mr.
smith
warder
well,
if
the
alarm
is
there,
he
had
better
hear
the
bell.
i
think
it's
an
objective
test.
it
would
be
tested
in
the
court
by
the
judge
that
reads
it
and
tells
him
whether
there's
an
alarm
in
it.
that
you
can't
get
away
from
it.
mr.
smith
warder
right.
mr.
smith
warder
no.
i
said
he
publishes
at
his
peril
if
the
alarm
is
there,
and
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
a
defense
to
the
paper
if
the
editor
was
deaf
and
couldn’t
hear
the
alarm.
i
think
so
long
as
the
alarm
is
there,
then
perhaps
liability
is
warranted.
but
absent
of
alarm,
when
you
are
publishing,
you'll
read
this
article,
you
do
not
see
any
propensity
to
the
fame
or
to
offend
and
you
publish
and
after
the
fact,
you
get
caught.
this
is
hardly
consistent.
mr.
smith
warder
i
am
contending
that
in
a
false
like
case
--
well
what
i
am
really
coming
to
your
honor
is
i
think
the
constitution
prohibits
a
false
like
privacy
case
per
se.
mr.
smith
warder
it
would
go
a
little
further
here
--
mr.
smith
warder
no,
time
against
hill
was
decided
under
a
special
statute
where
under
truth
was
a
defense.
you
see,
i
am
dealing
with
common
law
privacy
where
a
truth
is
not
a
defense.
mr.
smith
warder
i'm
talking
common
law
--
mr.
smith
warder
i
am
talking
the
common
law
of
defamation
and
the
constitutional
limitation
as
i
understand
them
on
the
cause
of
action
for
libel.
and
your
honor
to
develop
the
thought
as
i
understand
it
in
a
false
like
privacy
case,
there
is
never
an
alarm
bell.
if
there
were,
it
would
be
a
cause
of
action
for
libel.
this
whole
concept
of
a
false
like
privacy
is
a
concept
designed
by
the
common
law
of
courts
to
give
a
plaintiff
a
cause
of
action
who
could
not
win
his
case
if
it
were
brought
in
libel.
mr.
smith
warder
i
want
to
make
myself
clear
your
honor.
mr.
smith
warder
right.
mr.
smith
warder
right.
mr.
smith
warder
i
am
thinking
as
to
truth
or
falsity
only.
i
do
not
think
it
matters
whether
there
is
an
alarm
bell
as
to
the
propensity
to
offend.
if
an
editor
never
published
anything
offensive,
he
would
have
a
name,
be
pen
be
paper.
i
submit
that
the
original
watergate
story
was
offensive
to
many
and
still
used
to
some,
but
wouldn't
it
be
horrible,
had
it
not
been
published.
you
have
to
publish
offensive
things.
now,
i
am
speaking
strictly
of
whether
there
is
true
or
false
--
mr.
smith
warder
i'm
trying
to
make
it
the
same
your
honor.
i'm
not
distinguishing
in
terms
of
their
constitutional
protection.
i
am
distinguishing
in
terms
of
the
old
common
law.
this
is
what
i
am
urging
is
that
the
constitutional
protection
in
a
false
like
privacy
case
should
be
as
broad
as
it
is
in
the
libel
case.
mr.
smith
warder
your
honor
of
course,
i
did
and
the
jury
let
this
and
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
there
was
no
evidence
upon
which
the
jury
if
they
use
that
verdict.
mr.
smith
warder
that
is
a
question.
you
review
the
record.
if
the
evidence
is
there
--
mr.
smith
warder
i
think
we
would
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
the
evidence
is
there,
a
reckless
disregards
or
acknowledge
of
the
falsity.
mr.
smith
warder
i
think
that
we
have
to
come
to
it.
we
think
it's
a
matter
of
law
that
under
the
time
and
hill
standard,
there
was
no
evidence
of
malice.
mr.
smith
warder
no.
we
took
no
exception
to
the
instruction;
that
is
correct.
you
know
your
honors
in
reflecting
on
this
matter,
there's
another
anomaly
here.
somehow,
the
law
is
wrong.
if
eszterhas
had
stood
on
the
street
corner
and
gathered
the
list
and
said
orally
what
he
wrote
for
the
paper,
there
would
have
been
no
cause
of
action
for
privacy
and
no
course
of
action
for
slander.
the
words
are
not
slanderous
per
se
and
there
are
no
special
damages.
also,
there
would
have
been
no
cause
of
action
because
eszterhas
is
protected
by
the
freedom
of
speech
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
somehow,
you
put
it
in
the
paper.
you
remember
that
the
newspaper
has
two
defenses.
one;
freedom
of
speech,
second;
its
own
special
freedom
of
the
press,
and
to
get
an
opposite
result
from
the
printed
word
rather
than
the
oral
statement
to
me
makes
no
sense.
now,
i
submit
i
don't
--
mr.
smith
warder
generally
--
mr.
smith
warder
professor
hetmerg
even
makes
that
flat
statement
in
his
book
on
torts.
i
don't
think
it's
any
longer
true.
i
have
in
mind
the
electronic
devices
which
might
now
constitute
an
invasion
of
privacy,
but
which
are
beyond
the
scope
of
this
case
in
which
we
need
not
consider.
mr.
smith
warder
no
your
honor.
mr.
smith
warder
no
your
honor.
had
this
been
an
action
in
trespass,
there
would
have
been
the
jurisdiction
or
amount
for
diversity
case.
this
gentleman
was
seen
approaching
--
mr.
smith
warder
there's
no
trespass
case
at
all.
the
man
is
not
a
trespasser
until
it
is
made
known
to
him
that
his
presence
is
unwarranted.
up
to
that
point,
he
is
at
worst
a
licensee.
these
people
are
no
more
a
trespassers
than
the
public
--
mr.
smith
warder
the
children
were
there.
they
were
in
charge.
mr.
smith
warder
they
would,
they
were
in
charge
of
the
property
of
course
they
can
give
--
mr.
smith
warder
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
smith
warder
no,
but
the
17-year
old
--
mr.
smith
warder
well,
i
don't
know
what
the
law
of
kentucky
is,
but
i
know
that
if
i
leave
my
children
with
a
17-year-old
babysitter,
she's
in
charge
of
that
house
until
i
get
back.
mr.
smith
warder
i
would
think
so.
she
is
the
possessor
of
the
real
estate
until
my
return.
mr.
smith
warder
he
said
the
mother
was
not
here,
yes.
mr.
smith
warder
no,
they
didn't
say
don't
come
in.
mr.
smith
warder
they
didn't
say
don't
come
in.
they
didn't
say
please
get
out
--
mr.
smith
warder
because
they
asked
for
it.
the
reporters
asked
for
mrs.
cantrell.
mr.
smith
warder
not
at
all.
mr.
smith
warder
or
of
the
old
--
mr.
smith
warder
was
the
old
common
law
concept
of
course.
i
was
taken
in
terms
of
trespass
to
real
property
and
i
think
that's
what's
been
argued
to
your
honors.
mr.
smith
warder
no.
her
complaint
is
that
we
published
her
false
statements
concerning
her.
mr.
smith
warder
well
your
honors,
i
see
i
have
sometime
left
but
i
have
nothing
to
add
to
these
remarks
and
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
waive
my
right
to
--
