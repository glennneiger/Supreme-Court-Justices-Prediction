those
hardly

justice

stewart
story
from
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
concept
is
almost
self-defining,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it's
printed
in
the
newspaper,
some
editor
has
decided
that
it's
newsworthy.
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
not
for
the
courts
to
review
that
judgment;
it's
a
self-defining
concept,
isn't
it,
it's
in
the
newspaper
so
its
newsworthy?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
should
think
your
case
here
would
be
mr.
sherman
that
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
precisely
in
terms
of
time
versus
hill,
and
that
the
jury
brought
in
its
verdict
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
there
but
there's
no
plaintiff

justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
in
quotation
marks
in

on
page

justice
potter
stewart
i
cannot
find
it
either.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
where
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
common
law
standard
of
malice
is
all
that
had
to
do
with
the
punitive
damages,
that's
what
this
was
about,
punitive
damages
and
that
depends
as
i
understand
it
under
the
west
virginia
and
ohio
law
upon
proving
conventional
malice,
i.
e.
ill
will,
which
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
new
york
times
or
time
against
hill
kind
of
malice.
justice
potter
stewart
but
everybody
seems
to
agree
that
the
complaint
was
in
perhaps
implicitly
amended
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
page
is
that
on?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it
will
overrule
times
against
hill.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
very
clear
to
me
about
your
argument
as
you
pressing
this
down.
i'm
not
clear
whether
you're
talking
about
the
common
law
of
defamation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
are
you
talking
about
the
constitutional
limitations
upon
the
common
law
of
defamation?
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
this
court
i
think
that
properly
analyzed
indicate
that
the
two
guarantees
are
not
cognate
that
you
might
very
well
get
a
different
result
under
a
free
press
case
than
you
would
under
free
speech
case.
and
it
isn't
true
that
the
invasion
of
privacy
generally
is
something
to
which
only
media,
publishers
are
liable?
justice
potter
stewart
by
definition
it
involves
publicizing
rather
than
merely
an
individual
speaking?
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
this
is
a
diversity
of
citizenship
action,
brought
in
a
federal
district
court,
grounded
upon
invasion
of
the
petitioner's
privacy.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
for
the
plaintiffs
but
this
judgment
was
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals
under
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
some
detail
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
with
respect
to
two
of
the
defendants,
the
cleveland
plain
dealer
and
one
of
its
reporters,
the
trial
judge
did
not
commit
constitutional
error
in
allowing
the
case
to
go
to
the
jury
under
the
instructions
that
he
gave
and
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
