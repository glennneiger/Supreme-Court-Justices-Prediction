or
was
that
state
malice?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
makes
a
lot
of
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
where
is
it
in
the
records
that
he
denied
your
right
to
punitive
damage,
where
is
that?
i
don't
find
in
the
printed
record
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you,
in
your
faith
doesn't
punitive
damage
depends
upon
the
traditional
kind
of
malice
of
the
old
will,
an
intent
to
do
wrong?
isn't
that
what's
malice
used
in
libel
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
will
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
different,
if
that's
a
different
kind
of
malice,
then
the
new
york
times
comes
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
the
transcript
is
here
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
other
--
this
neither
the
predicament?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
under
the
--
you
said
lack
of
malice,
what
do
you
suppose
--
you
say
he
met
the
time
inc.
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
after
trial,
he
denied
your,
he
granted
in
part,
you
moved
and
then
denied
in
part.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
i
think
more
than
--
that's
even
more
clearer
than
he
thought
there's
enough
evidence
for
the
jury.
this
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
depended
on
the
so
called
new
york
times
malice.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
--
i
think
--
we
might
be
talking
about
two
different
things
without
distinguishing
them.
you
are
suggesting
that
perhaps
an
editor
wouldn't
have
an
alarm
bell
in
terms
of
whether
this
might
embarrass
a
person.
but
if
you
--
there's
another
aspect,
whether
or
not
there
might
be
an
alarm
bell
as
to
whether
the
statement
is
false.
now,
there
might
be
an
alarm
bell
when
its
false,
but
no
alarm
bell
would
make
any
difference
even
if
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
time
against
hill
said
there
had
to
be
at
least
recklessness
with
respect
to
truth
or
falsity.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
this
jury
found
that
as
was
--
as
it
had
it
under
instruction
that
there
was
at
least
recklessness
in
terms
of
truth
or
falsity.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
can
be
absolutely
right
in
what
you
said
so
far,
but
you
haven't
gotten
to
whether
or
not
there
is
an
alarm
bell
with
respect
to
truth
or
falsity.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
why
you
distinguish
between
libel
and
the
false
like
cases
in
terms
of
the
constitutional
protection.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
then
you
get
the
protection
to
that
little
time
construction
theory?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
that
the
court
of
appeal
is
right,
you
win,
but
what
if
they're
wrong?
you
haven't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
loose
then?
