mr.
sherman,
this
was
a
diversity
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
were
you
proceeding
under
ohio
law
of
privacy
or
west
virginia
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they're
the
same?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
district
court
may
have
foreseen
our
gertz
case
before
it
was
handed
down?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
suggesting
then
that
even
a
right
of
privacy
consistent
with
the
opinion
in
time
against
hill
violates
the
first
amendment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
certainly
go
further
than
the
time
against
hill?
