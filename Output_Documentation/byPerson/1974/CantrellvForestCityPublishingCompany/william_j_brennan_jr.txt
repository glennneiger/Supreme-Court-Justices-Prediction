knew,

there

you

in

notwithstanding
what
we
saw
earlier
as
to
the
instructions
that
were

at

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
there
is
his
statement
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
in
the
present
case,
the
district
judge
made
a
finding
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
claim
that
an
invasion
of
privacy
was
done
maliciously
within
the
legal
definition
of
that
term,
and
over
the
next
page,
having
correctly
determined
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
known
falsity
or
reckless
disregard
of
the
truth,
district
court
should
have
granted
the
motion
for
direct
to
verdict
as
sole
defendants.
now,
where
--
i
can't
seem
to
find
in
this
record,
where
is
there
any
district
court
finding
that
there
was
no
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
kind
of
malice,
new
york
times
malice
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
finding
of
time
and
hill
malice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that's
my
point
mr.
sherman.
the
point
is
i
just
don't
know
where
there's
any
finding
that
there
was
no
evidence
and
it
seems
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
have
to
prove
new
york
--
or
time
and
hill
same
thing
kind
of
malice
even
to
get
compensatory
judgment,
irrespective
of
punitive
damages,
and
you
got
one
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
he
refused
to
set
it
aside
certainly
implies
that
he
thought
there
was
evidence
enough
to
support
the
finding
that
he
told
the
jury
they
must
find
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
yet
the
court
of
appeals
--
he
made
a
find,
there
was
no
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
only
goes
on
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
he
imputes
at
the
top
of
page
126
having
correctly
determined
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
known
falsity
or
reckless
to
disregarded
the
truth,
that's
the
time
and
hill
standard.
the
district
court
should
have
granted
the
motion
for
direct
to
verdict.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
your
colleague
will
tell
us
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
all
the
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
did
he
require
you
to
go
on
with
your
defense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
did
he
require
you
to
go
on
with
your
defense
because
if
this
were
related
to
time
and
hill
malice,
that's
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
mean
the
objection
that
going
out
of
the
defense,
you
went
on
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
he
said
without
ruling
gentlemen
mr.
warder,
you
may
proceed
with
your
defense
and
you
did.
you're
right
and
what
you
tell
us
is
the
interpretation
of
that.
you
should
have
[laughter
attempt]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
warder,
i
noticed
that
the
complaint
sounds
an
action
for
malicious
and
defamatory
libel.
well
what
happened
to
that
aspect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
an
amended
complaint
or
is
that
the
only
concern?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
notice
incidentally
in
the
complaint
that
on
punitive
damages,
the
allegation
is
the
said
publication,
maliciously,
falsely,
blatantly
and
scandalously
by
trace
plaintiff's
dissident,
thatâ€™s
a
different
kind
of
malice
isn't
it
than
the
time
and
hill
malice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's

justice

it
would
go
with
