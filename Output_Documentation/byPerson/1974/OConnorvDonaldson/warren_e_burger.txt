chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
74-8,
o'connor
against
donaldson.
mr.
gearey
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
found
that
he
had
not
been
offered
if
i
recall
correctly,
the
jury's
finding
is
that
he
had
not
been
offered
occupational
therapy,
is
that
not
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
fifth
circuit
seem
to
focus
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
you
read
this
record
what
was
the
latest
date,
just
the
year
would
be
enough
to
aid
me,
when
he
refused
to
some
form
of
therapy
that
was
offered
to
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
was
for
15
years,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
i
take
it
that
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
take
it,
the
issue
of
dangerousness
would
not
be
involved
in
that
except
as
it
might
bear
indirectly,
collaterally
on
whether
he
had
recovered.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
he
showed
that
he
was
not
dangerous
that
wouldn't
be
enough
to
bring
about
his
release?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
hearing
officers
neutral
officer
from
the
outside,
is
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
something
like
the
hearing
examiners
in
the
federal
system.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he's
not
part
of
the
hospital
staff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
so
far
as
the
states
of
patients
in
the
state
of
florida
are
concerned,
are
there
now
guidelines
in
your
view
in
the
florida
statute
in
the
new
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
finding
of
the
hearing
examiner
is
adverse
to
the
patient
he
may
then
go
to
the
florida
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
an
appeal,
he
may
ask
for
a
review
of
the
hearing
examiner's
determination,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
can
this
kind
of
a
case
happen
again
in
florida
if
florida
enforces
its
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
trial
judge
here
give
an
instruction
in
terms
of
the
existence
of
a
constitutional
right
or
did
he
instruct
the
jury
merely
that
there
was
a
right
without
defining
what
kind
of
a
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn't
it
limited
to
available
cures?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
had
to
do
it
or
they
couldn't
have
reached
that
verdict
under
these
instructions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ennis.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
your
view
as
to
whether
the
new
florida
statute
would
give
to
the
patients,
all
the
protection
they
need,
assuming
first
that
it's
enforced
and
applied
not
ignored.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
it's
an
automatic
review
every
six
months,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
at
most,
there
is
the
opportunity
to
demonstrate
capacity
to
be
released
or
the
propriety
of
release
with
great
frequency.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
that
it's
more
comprehensive,
i
take
it,
then
you
mean
that
it's
better
than
the
undefined
constitutional
right
postulated
by
the
fifth
circuit.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
given
the
florida
statute,
he
really
doesn't
need
it,
does
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
comports
with
the
instruction
given
by
the
trial
judge
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
first,
did
the
solicitor
general
say
a
constitutional
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
did
he
take
into
account
the
language
of
the
charged
that
has
to
do
with
--
i've
forgotten
the
precise
words,
mr.
justice
white
focused
on
a
few
moments
ago,
all
treatment,
not
treatment
that's
available,
you
are
instructed
that
person
who
is
involuntarily,
civilly
committed
does
have
a
constitutional
right
to
receive
such
treatment
as
you
will
give
him
as
will
give
him
a
realistic
opportunity
to
be
cured.
now,
does
that
take
into
account
that
instruction
that
there
may
be
no
treatment
then
known
that
will
give
a
realistic
opportunity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
was
such
then
available?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
it
not
true
that
in
a
good
many
jurisdictions
now
the
verdict
of
the
jury
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
either
by
a
statute
or
by
a
judicial
decision
must
be
followed
by
the
traditional
civil
commitment
proceeding
in
order
to
confine
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
in
that
case
your
statement
of
your
underlying
theory
would
reach
it
because
his
confinement
would
have
been
pursuant
in
those
cases
to
a
civil
commitment
proceeding
which
was
triggered
by
a
jury
verdict
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
when
he
was
criminally
prosecuted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
instructions
of
the
trial
court
give
any
indications
to
the
jury
that
they
were
to
examine
the
entire
15
years
of
confinement
and
consider
whether
there
was
one
situation
prevailing
in
part
of
that
time
and
another
at
a
different
part
that
is,
having
in
mind
that
this
man
was
a
christian
scientist
and
that
this
record
shows
beyond
any
dispute
that
he
had
categorically
refused
certain
treatments
at
certain
time,
did
you
give
the
jury
a
chance
to
treat
that
as
a
mitigating
factor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
on
that
respect,
do
you
think
the
verdict
is
consistent
with
the
undisputed
evidence
that
he
did
consistently
over
a
long
period
of
time
refuse
any
treatment
whatever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
was
upheld
and
that
--
didn't
that
--
sometimes
you
say
on
a
procedural
ground
or
a
non-merit
ground.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
ennis.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
judgment
and
opinion
of
the
court
in
74-8,
o'connor
against
donaldson
will
be
announced
by
mr.
justice
stewart.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
court
will
be
in
recess
from
today
until
monday,
the
30th
of
june
at
which
time
we
will
adjourn
for
the
term
unless
otherwise
ordered
at
that
time.
