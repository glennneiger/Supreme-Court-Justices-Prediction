are

are

justice

this
is
a

where
in
fact
he
had
no
treatment
isn't
it?
justice

incidentally
a

hearing
which
you
just
described,
was
that
at
the

the

and
there's
been
none
--
no
other

comparable

set?
justice

is
that
automatic
that
is
without

on

of

justice

and
where
is

where

and
if

or
in

it
was

for

wasn't
it?
justice

not
only
apparently,
they
did,
did
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know,
but
the
solicitor
general
says
that
he
is
filing
in
as
much
as
your
brief
characterizes
the
actions
and
the
position
and
united

suspecting
involuntarily
confined
mental
patients,
right
to
treatment
i
believe
a
appropriate
device
in
the
court
more
fully.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
prompted
by
what
you
said
in
your
brief
about
what
the
united
states
does.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
doesn't
--
he
knew
perhaps
they're
unlawful
under
the
statutory
tests
than
in
effect
in
florida,
doesn't
mean
he
knew
that
he
was
depriving
anybody
of
any
federal
rights.
justice
potter
stewart
that
wasn't
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
in
fact
is
a
violation
of
federal
law.
justice
potter
stewart
constitutional
or
statutory.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
exactly
do
you
rely
on
for
stating
that
the
jury
must
be
found
that
he
knew
that
his
acts
were
unlawful?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ennis,
directing
or
just
thinking
about
a
problem
not
of
the
emotionally
ill
who
were
--
some
of
whom
at
least
are
presumptively
curable,
some
of
whom
are
not
and
any
of
whom,
it
was
just
a
over
presumption
as
contrasted
with
the
mentally
retarded
as
a
result
of
a
congenital
serious
brain
damage,
for
example.
justice
potter
stewart
surely,
would
you
quarrel
with
the
state's
constitutional
power
to
enact
a
law
or
to
have
a
program
that
would
say
we're
going
to
institutionalize
these
people
in
order
to
take
them
out
of
the
families
of
the
impoverished
and
others
to
give
them
the
best
custodial
care,
we
can
and
is
decent
so
far
as
the
care
but
they're
untreatable.
damages
could
keep
them
in
an
institution
indefinitely.
justice
potter
stewart
autistic
persons?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
are
many
varieties
but
i
have
premised
this
on
people
who
had
congenital
brain
damage.
justice
potter
stewart
physical
brain
damage.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
some
of
these
things,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
it
is
because
up
until
really
very
recently
as
the
history
of
western
civilization
goes,
that
was
a
whole
concept
of
what
--
to
use
a
old-fashioned
phrase
but
the
phrase,
the
label
indicates
the
theory.
that's
when
an
insane
asylum
was
for.
it
was
to
--
presumptively
these
people
--
then
state
of
the
art,
were
not
curable.
this
was
a
permanent
condition
or
one
of
indefinite
duration
and
the
idea
was
if
you
all
know
provide
decent,
custodial
care
and
to
relieve
the
families
of
the
economic,
social,
and
psychological
damage
that
would
follow
from
the
presence
of
those
people
in
their
families
or
households
and
institutions
were
set
up
to
provide
that
service
and
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
in
some
states
today
the
commitment
was
not
for
treatment
but
the
commitment
was
for
custody.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
think
it
is
involved
here.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
definition
of
these
people
are
lacking
in
competence
to
do
anything
voluntarily
for
themselves.
we're
talking
about
the
members
of
their
family,
their
fathers
or
mothers
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
involuntary
by
your
definition.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ennis,
before
you
sit
down,
i
want
to
return
to
your
question
i
asked
the
attorney
general,
was
any
effort
made
by
respondent
to
obtain
his
release
under
--
what
it
is,
chapter
394
of
the
florida
law?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
upheld.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
by
way
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
the
respondent,
kenneth
donaldson,
was
civilly
committed
to
confinement
as
a
mental
patient
in
the
florida
state
hospital
at
chattahoochee
in
1957.
he
was
kept
in
custody
there
against
his
will
for
nearly
15
years.
the
petitioner,
dr.
j.
b.
o'connor,
was
the
hospital's
superintendent
during
most
of
that
period.
throughout
his
confinement
donaldson
repeatedly,
but
unsuccessfully,
demanded
his
release,
claiming
that
he
was
dangerous
to
no
one,
that
he
was
not
mentally
ill,
and
that,
at
any
rate,
the
hospital
was
not
providing
treatment
for
his
supposed
illness.
finally,
in
1971,
donaldson
brought
this
lawsuit
under
section
1983
of
title
42
of
the
united
states
code
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
florida,
alleging
that
o'connor,
and
other
members
of
the
hospital
staff
had
intentionally
and
maliciously
deprived
him
of
his
constitutional
rights.
after
a
four-day
trial,
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
assessing
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
against
o'connor
and
a
codefendant.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
that
judgment.
we
granted
o'connor's
petition
for
certiorari
because
of
the
important
constitutional
questions
seemingly
presented.
donaldson's
commitment
was
initiated
by
his
father,
who
thought
that
his
son
was
suffering
from
"delusions."
after
hearings
before
a
county
judge
of
pinellas
county,
florida,
donaldson
was
committed
for
care,
maintenance,
and
treatment
pursuant
to
florida
statutory
provisions
that
have
since
been
repealed.
the
state
law
was
less
than
clear
in
specifying
the
grounds
necessary
for
commitment
at
that
time,
and
the
record
is
scanty
as
to
donaldson's
condition
at
the
time
of
the
judicial
hearing.
these
matters
are,
however,
irrelevant,
for
this
case
involves
no
challenge
to
the
initial
commitment,
but
is
focused,
instead,
upon
the
nearly
15
years
of
confinement
that
followed.
the
testimony
at
the
trial
demonstrated,
without
contradiction,
that
donaldson
had
posed
no
danger
to
others
during
his
long
confinement,
or
indeed
at
any
point
in
his
life.
there
was
no
evidence
that
donaldson
had
ever
been
suicidal
or
been
thought
likely
to
inflict
injury
upon
himself.
one
of
o'connor's
codefendants
acknowledged
that
donaldson
could
have
earned
his
own
living
outside
the
hospital.
he
had
done
so
for
some
14
years
before
his
commitment,
and
immediately
upon
his
release
he
secured
a
responsible
job
in
hotel
administration.
furthermore,
donaldson's
frequent
request
for
--
requests
for
release
had
been
supported
by
responsible
persons
willing
and
able
to
provide
him
any
care
he
might
need
on
release.
the
evidence
showed
that
donaldson's
confinement
was
a
simple
regime
of
enforced
custodial
care,
not
a
program
designed
to
alleviate
or
cure
his
supposed
illness.
o'connor
described
donaldson's
treatment
as
"milieu
therapy."
but
witnesses
from
the
hospital
staff
conceded
that,
in
the
context
at
least
of
this
case,
"milieu
therapy"
was
a
euphemism
for
confinement
in
the
"milieu"
of
a
mental
hospital.
for
substantial
periods,
donaldson
was
simply
kept
in
a
large
room
that
housed
60
patients,
many
of
whom
were
under
criminal
commitment.
at
the
trial,
o'connor's
principal
defense
was
that
he
had
acted
in
good
faith
and
was
therefore
immune
from
any
liability
for
monetary
damages.
his
position,
in
short,
was
that
state
law,
which
he
had
believed
valid,
had
authorized
indefinite
custodial
confinement
of
the
mentally
ill
even
if
they
were
not
given
treatment
and
even
if
their
release
could
harm
no
one.
the
trial
judge
instructed
the
members
of
the
jury
that
they
should
find
that
o'connor
had
violated
donaldson's
constitutional
rights
if
they
found
that
he
had
confined
donaldson
against
his
will,
knowing
that
he
was
not
mentally
ill
or
dangerous
or
knowing
that
if
mentally
ill
he
was
not
receiving
treatment
for
his
alleged
mental
illness.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
for
donaldson
against
o'connor
and
a
codefendant,
and
awarded
damages
of
$38,500,
which
including
$10,000
in
punitive
damages.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
a
broad
opinion
dealing,
and
i'm
quoting
with
"the
far-reaching
question
whether
the
fourteenth
amendment
guarantees
a
right
to
treatment
to
persons
involuntarily
civilly
committed
to
state
mental
hospitals."
the
appellate
court
held
that
when,
as
in
donaldson's
case,
the
rationale
for
confinement
is
that
the
patient
is
in
need
of
treatment,
the
constitution
requires
that
minimally
adequate
treatment
in
fact
be
provided.
the
court
further
expressed
the
view
that,
regardless
of
the
grounds
for
involuntary
civil
commitment,
a
person
confined
against
his
will
at
a
state
mental
institution
has
a
constitutional
right
to
receive
such
individual
treatment
as
will
give
him
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
cured
or
to
improve
his
mental
condition.
conversely,
the
court's
opinion
clearly
implied
that
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
for
a
state
to
confine
a
mentally
ill
person
against
his
will
in
order
to
treat
his
illness,
regardless
of
whether
his
illness
renders
him
dangerous
to
himself
or
others.
we
have
concluded
that
the
difficult
issues
of
constitutional
law
dealt
with
by
the
court
of
appeals
are
not
presented
by
this
case
in
its
present
posture.
specifically,
there
is
no
reason
now
to
decide
whether
mentally
ill
persons
dangerous
to
themselves
or
to
others
have
a
right
to
treatment
upon
compulsory
confinement
by
the
state,
or
whether
the
state
may
compulsorily
confine
a
nondangerous,
mentally
ill
individual
for
the
purpose
of
treatment.
as
we
view
it,
this
case
raises
a
single,
relatively
simple,
but
nonetheless
important
question
concerning
every
man's
constitutional
right
to
liberty.
the
jury
found
that
donaldson
was
neither
dangerous
to
himself
nor
dangerous
to
others,
and
also
found
that,
if
mentally
ill,
donaldson
had
not
received
treatment.
that
verdict,
based
upon
abundant
evidence,
makes
the
issue
before
this
court
a
narrow
one.
we
need
not
decide
whether,
when,
or
by
what
procedures,
a
mentally
ill
person
may
be
confined
by
the
state
on
any
of
the
grounds
which,
under
contemporary
statutes,
are
generally
advanced
to
justify
involuntary
confinement
of
such
a
person,
that
is
to
prevent
injury
to
the
public,
to
ensure
his
own
survival
or
safety,
or
to
alleviate
or
cure
his
illness.
for
the
jury
found
that
none
of
the
above
grounds
for
continued
confinement
was
present
in
donaldson's
case.
we
hold
that
a
finding
of
mental
illness
alone
cannot
justify
a
state's
locking
a
person
up
against
his
will
and
keeping
him
indefinitely
in
simple
custodial
confinement.
assuming
that
the
term
can
be
given
a
reasonably
precise
content
and
that
the
"mentally
ill"
can
be
identified
with
reasonable
accuracy,
there
is
still
no
constitutional
basis
for
confining
such
persons
involuntarily
if
they
are
dangerous
to
no
one
and
can
live
safely
in
freedom.
in
short,
a
state
cannot
constitutionally
confine
without
more
a
nondangerous
individual
who
is
capable
of
surviving
safely
in
freedom
by
himself
or
with
the
help
of
willing
and
responsible
family
members
or
friends.
since
the
jury
found,
upon
ample
evidence,
that
o'connor,
as
an
agent
of
the
state,
knowingly
did
so
confine
donaldson,
it
properly
concluded
that
o'connor
violated
donaldson's
constitutional
right
to
freedom.
o'connor
contends
that
in
any
event
he
should
not
be
held
personally
liable
for
monetary
damages
because
his
decisions
were
made
in
good
faith.
specifically,
o'connor
argues
that
he
was
acting
pursuant
to
state
law
which,
he
believed,
authorized
confinement
of
the
mentally
ill
even
when
their
release
would
not
compromise
their
safety
or
constitute
a
danger
to
others,
and
that
he
could
not
reasonably
have
been
expected
to
know
that
the
state
law
as
he
understood
it
was
constitutionally
invalid.
a
proposed
instruction
to
this
effect
was
rejected
by
the
district
court.
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
acted
in
this
case
with
the
benefit
of
this
court's
most
recent
decision
on
the
scope
of
the
qualified
immunity
possessed
by
state
officials.
that
decision
was
in
the
case
of
wood
against
strickland
decided
earlier
this
term.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
to
enable
that
court
to
consider,
in
the
light
of
wood
against
strickland,
whether
the
district
judge's
failure
to
instruct
with
regard
to
the
effect
of
o'connor's
claimed
reliance
on
state
law
rendered
inadequate
the
instructions
as
to
o'connor's
liability
for
compensatory
and
punitive
money
damages.
the
chief
justice,
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion.
