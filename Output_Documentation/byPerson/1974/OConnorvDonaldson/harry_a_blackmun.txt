justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
not
that
refused
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
according
to
your
statement
to
the
case
on
page
four
of
your
brief,
he
could
have
been
released
upon
his
applications
if
there
were
no
objection
from
the
head
of
the
hospital,
that's
the
way
i
read
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
just
his
application
i
suppose
to
the
hospital
itself.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
be
released
if
there
were
no
objection.
that's
why
you
summarized
it,
the
then
law
of
florida.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
then
an
alternative
way
of
release
is
even
without
a
petition
from
anybody,
if
three
members
of
the
hospital
certified
that
he
--
to
a
restoration
of
mental
competency.
