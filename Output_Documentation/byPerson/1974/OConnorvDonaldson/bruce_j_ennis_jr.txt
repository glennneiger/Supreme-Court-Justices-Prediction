mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioner's
arguments
largely
ignore
the
narrow
due
process
theory
under
which
this
case
was
tried
and
submitted
to
the
jury.
this
case
involves
only
the
application
in
a
civil
commitment
context
of
the
due
process
rule
this
court
applied
in
jackson
versus
indiana
that
the
nature
and
duration
of
a
deprivation
of
liberty
must
bear
a
reasonable
relation
to
the
purpose
for
that
deprivation.
specifically,
under
the
instructions
in
this
case,
petitioner
was
not
held
liable
because
he
failed
or
was
unable
to
treat
respondent.
he
was
held
liable
because
he
failed
and
refused
to
release
respondent
even
though
he
knew
that
respondent
was
confined
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
treatment
and
knew
that
respondent
was
receiving
no
treatment
and
was
receiving
instead
only
the
custodial
care
he
would
have
received
in
a
prison.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
that
the
new
florida
statute
is
in
many
respects
more
comprehensive
than
the
constitutional
right
we
are
urging
in
this
case
and
i
think
properly
so.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
let
me
address
that
point.
if
there
is
a
right
to
treatment,
surely
there
must
be
a
right
to
something
other
than
sham
treatment.
hospitals
could
not
simply
chain
patients
to
their
beds
and
call
back
treatment.
therefore
i
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
quite
correct
as
a
matter
of
law
in
ruling
that
if
there
is
a
right
to
treatment,
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
treatment
provided
must
give
a
reasonable
opportunity
as
the
fifth
circuit
raised
it
to
cure
or
improve
the
patient's
condition.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
may
be
your
honor.
under
the
instructions
in
this
case
however,
this
case
was
limited
to
the
case
of
a
person
who
was
not
dangerous
either
to
himself
or
others.
and
therefore,
if
it
turned
out
that
with
the
provision
of
whatever
treatment
could
be
provided,
his
condition
could
not
be
improved.
then
the
question
would
arise
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
they
did
not
contend
in
this
case
that
treatment
would
be
unavailing
if
offered.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
now,
let
me
continue
to
point
out
that
under
the
instructions
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
may
be
your
honor.
we
tried
to
stress
in
our
brief
that
this
is
in
fact
a
very
narrow
case
in
very
narrow
circumstances
and
those
other,
perhaps
more
difficult
questions
are
not
presently
before
the
court.
i
wish
to
point
out
also
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
in
fact
i
believe
that
what
counsel
for
petitioner
is
asking
for
is
in
effect
an
advisory
opinion
from
the
court
to
guide
future
cases.
i
do
not
think
that
is
required
here.
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor,
absolutely
right.
the
florida
statute
itself
could
give
the
content
for
the
nature
of
the
right
to
treatment
in
future
cases.
but
more
than
that,
let
me
point
this
out,
i
received
only
this
morning,
a
letter
from
the
solicitor
general
of
the
united
states
confirming
that
the
united
states
takes
the
position
that
patients
involuntarily
confined
do
have
a
right
to
receive
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
cure
or
improvement.
that
is
the
language
from
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
in
wyatt
versus
aderbolt
which
was
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
absolutely
your
honor,
absolutely.
that
is
the
position
of
the
united
states.
it
is
also
the
position
of
all
of
the
relevant
professional
organizations.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
yes
he
does.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes
it
does
your
honor.
but
first
let
me
answer
your
specific
question.
the
letter
i
received
this
morning
from
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
it
was
--
as
i
understand
it,
submitted
to
the
clerk
with
the
request
that
it'd
be
submitted.
it
is
in
effect
an
amicus
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no
your
honor.
the
point
is
this,
the
united
states
is
participating
as
plaintiff
or
as
amicus
in
many
so
called
right
to
treatment
cases
around
the
country.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me
point
out
one
fact
that
i
think
is
very
important
in
this
case.
the
jury
found
that
the
petitioner
continued
to
confine
respondent
even
though
he
knew
that
respondent
was
not
dangerous
to
himself
or
to
others
and
even
though
he
knew
that
respondent
was
not
receiving
any
treatment.
most
important,
the
jury
found
that
petitioner
confined
respondent
even
though
he
knew
that
continued
confinement
under
those
circumstances
was
not
lawful.
because
of
that
jury
finding,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
and
can
be
no
issue
of
retroactivity
in
this
case.
the
jury
found
as
a
fact
that
the
petitioner
knew
that
his
acts
were
unlawful.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
but
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
can
be
found
in
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--
monroe
versus
pape
i
believe
where
this
court
indicated
that
under
section
1983,
proof
of
a
specific
intent
to
deprive
a
person
of
a
constitutional
right
is
not
required.
all
that
is
required
is
proof
to
deprive
a
person
of
some
liberty
which
in
fact
is
an
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
liberty.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
monroe
v.
pape,
this
court
said
that
if
a
man
is
held
responsible
for
the
natural
consequences
of
his
acts.
but
in
this
case,
it's
even
easier
than
that
because
in
this
case
the
jury
went
further
and
expressly
found
that
the
acts
of
the
petitioner
were
not
only
bad
faith
but
actually
amounted
to
malice
and
wanton
and
oppressive
conduct
for
a
respondent.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
instruction
is
quoted
at
page
74
of
our
brief.
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
if
the
jury
should
believe
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
defendants
reasonably
believed
in
good
faith
that
detention
of
plaintiff
was
proper
for
the
length
of
time
he
was
so
confined,
then
a
verdict
for
defendant
should
be
entered
even
though
the
jury
may
find
the
detention
to
have
been
unlawful.
however,
mere
good
intentions
which
do
not
give
rise
to
a
reasonable
belief
that
detention
is
lawfully
required
cannot
justify
plaintiff's
confinement
in
the
florida
state
hospital.
read
together,
that
instruction
authorized
the
jury
to
return
a
verdict
for
the
petitioner,
if
they
believed
that
the
petitioner
reasonably
believed
that
respondent's
continued
confinement
was
legally
proper
even
if
the
fact
it
was
not.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'm
reading
these
two
instructions
together,
the
first
of
which
says
proper
and
the
second
of
which
in
elaboration,
talks
about
lawfully
required.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no
it
does
not
your
honor.
that
is
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
and
that
is
contained
in
our
brief
at
pages
39
and
40,
the
instruction
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
pages
39
and
40
of
respondent's
brief
containing
the
instruction
relevant
to
that
point.
there,
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
that
in
order
to
prove
his
civil
rights
act
case
under
section
1983,
the
plaintiff
had
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
petitioner
confined
plaintiff
against
his
will
knowing
that
he
was
not
mentally
ill
or
dangerous
or
knowing
that
if
mentally
ill,
he
was
not
receiving
treatment.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
quite
understand
your
question
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
this
is
certainly
a
proper
instruction.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
under
the
instructions
in
this
case
which
are
later
amplified
by
the
judge
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
there's
nothing
improper
about
this
instruction.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
if
that
instruction
were
read
alone,
you're
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
i
did
not
understand
your
question.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
is
then
corrected
if
you'll
look
on
the
next
page
of
respondents
brief
as
the
court
elaborates,
page
40
of
respondent's
brief.
the
court
goes
on
to
say
that
the
purpose
of
involuntary
hospitalization
is
treatment
and
not
mere
custodial
care
or
punishment
if
a
patient
is
not
a
danger
to
himself
or
others
and
then
says
without
such
treatment
there
is
no
justification
from
a
constitutional
stand
point
for
a
continued
confinement
unless
you
should
also
find
that
the
plaintiff
was
dangerous
either
to
himself
or
to
others.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think
all
the
instruction
certainly
have
to
be
read
together
your
honor.
i
found
nothing
improper
in
the
initial
instruction
but
i
think
as
amplified
in
the
later
instructions,
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
jury
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
our
position
would
be
as
follows,
although
that
question
does
not
arise
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
but
our
position
would
be
as
follows,
we
would
contend
that
all
persons
confined
under
non-criminal
standards
and
procedures
whether
dangerous
or
not
would
have
a
constitutional
right
to
receive
that
treatment
which
would
give
them
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
cure
or
improve
their
mental
condition.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
oh!
we're
not
talking
about
that
case
your
honor.
we're
talking
solely
about
strictly
civil
confinements
which
have
no
criminal
or
quasi-criminal
overtones.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
we
would
not
your
honor.
not
at
this
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
the
theory
of
this
case
is
where
the
purpose
for
a
confinement
is
not
a
criminal
law
or
purpose
then
the
patient
confined
would
have
an
opportunity
for
a
reasonable
level
of
treatment.
now,
i
wish
to
point
out
though
that
although
we
are
not
contending
in
this
case
that
persons
confined
under
the
criminal
law
would
have
a
right
to
treatment.
that
in
fact
--
question
has
been
left
expressly
open
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
a
case
called
united
states
ex
rel.
schuster
versus
herold
where
the
second
circuit
ruled
that
it
may
well
be
that
even
criminally
confined
persons
have
a
right
to
treatment
in
that
the
treatment
might
well
promote
their
possibility
of
early
parole
but
that
is
certainly
a
much,
much
more
difficult
question
than
the
question
raised
by
this
case
or
by
other
civil
cases.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
certainly
true.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
i
just
want
to
say
this
that
that
kind
of
case
might
well
raise
some
very
difficult
issues
of
preventive
detention
for
example
which
this
court
and
other
courts
have
grappled
with
for
decades.
we
are
not
prepared
at
this
time
to
argue
those
other
and
more
difficult
cases.
i
do
not
feel
i
have
the
authority
to
concede
a
way
or
to
support
a
right
to
treatment
in
those
criminal
law
cases.
we
really
have
only
brought
in
this
case
the
narrowest
possible
case
and
that
is
the
case
of
a
person
who
is
confined
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
treatment
who
had
never
been
charged
with
any
crime.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor
the
commitment
papers
are
sketchy
and
inconsistent
on
that
point.
it
was
not
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
there
was
--
i
can
say
this,
your
honor.
there
was
no
transcript
of
the
trial
at
the
initial
commitment
proceeding.
mr.
donaldson
testified
about
that
trial
and
that
is
in
the
record.
he
testified
that
though
he
asked
to
cross
examine
the
physicians
who
had
examined
him
he
was
not
permitted
to
do
so
and
the
physicians
did
not
testify.
he
held
a
very
brief
hearing
and
was
thereupon
committed.
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
commitment
papers
of
any
dangerous
act
whatsoever.
however,
the
florida
commitment
papers
did
have
boiler
plate
language
and
one
of
them
said
the
patient
may
be
a
danger
to
himself
or
others.
however,
another
commitment
paper
expressly
said
that
he
was
confined
to
florida
state
hospital
because
he
was
mentally
ill
and
dangerous
to
himself
or
others
or
in
order
to
ensure
proper
treatment.
so,
it
may
well
be
that
he
was
confined
not
because
the
committing
judge
thought
he
was
dangerous
but
simply
to
ensure
proper
treatment.
at
any
rate,
that
point
was
not
litigated
in
this
case
because
under
the
instruction
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
was
agreed
your
--
it
was
litigated,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
we
never
conceded
that
he
was
dangerous
at
the
time
of
commitment.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
we
didn't
dispute
it.
it
simply
was
not
at
issue
in
this
trial
because
in
this
trial
the
petitioner
expressly
acknowledged
that
he
had
a
duty
upon
receiving
a
patient
under
a
judicial
commitment
order
to
make
his
own
professionally
independent
determination
of
whether
that
patient
continued
to
require
confinement.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
tests
on
that
point
are
absolutely
clear
your
honor.
respondent's
expert
witnesses
examined
all
of
the
tests
that
were
given,
all
of
the
hospital
record
and
they
said
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
hospital
record
that
he
was
or
ever
would
be
a
danger
to
himself
or
others.
he
had
never
injured
himself
or
any
other
person.
he
had
always
been
self-employed,
a
tax
payer,
never
taken
welfare
and
furthermore,
the
test
results
of
the
psychological
tests
according
to
a
psychologist
who
testified
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
that
was
not
a
doctor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me
be
clear.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
all
of
the
employees
at
the
staff
of
florida
state
hospital
with
the
exception
of
petitioner
said
that
in
their
opinion,
respondent
was
not
dangerous.
his
co-defendant
testified
a
trial
that
respondent
was
not
dangerous.
the
director
of
the
psychology
department
at
florida
state
hospital
testified
that
in
his
opinion
respondent
was
not
dangerous.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
we
admitted
that
he
was
committed
for
the
purpose
of
treatment.
we
never
conceded
that
he
was
dangerous
at
the
time
of
commitment
but
that
issue
was
not
raised
or
litigated
in
this
trial.
under
the
instructions
in
this
case,
the
jury
had
only
to
find
that
after
his
confinement,
there
was
no
reasonable
basis
for
the
petitioner
to
believe
that
respondent
was
dangerous.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
we
do
take
a
position
on
that
in
a
footnote.
our
position
is
essentially
that
that
is
a
difficult
question
which
this
court
need
not
and
probably
should
not
address
itself
to
in
this
case.
however
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
simply
a
right
to
liberty.
that's
right
your
honor.
we
do
take
the
position
in
our
footnote,
in
our
brief
that
if
the
court
reaches
that
question,
it
should
rule
that
no
person
can
be
subjected
to
lengthy
or
indeterminate
involuntary
hospitalization
unless
that
person
is
dangerous
to
self
or
others
regardless
of
whether
adequate
treatment
is
or
is
not
provided.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
it
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
issue
was
specifically
raised
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i
might
say
that
briefs
have
been
filed
by
various
professional
organizations.
one
of
the
briefs
by
several
of
the
relevant
organizations,
the
american
psychological
association,
the
american
ortho-psychiatric
association
and
so
forth
takes
precisely
that
position
that
no
person
should
be
involuntarily
confined
solely
for
the
purpose
of
treatment
unless
that
person
is
also
a
danger
to
self
or
others.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
appropriate
course
for
this
court
to
take
on
that
issue
in
this
case
would
be
either
expressly
to
reserve
that
decision
or
to
indicate
as
it
has
indicated
in
other
cases
that
if
that
the
question
was
squarely
presented
to
the
court,
it
would
probably
rule
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
that
involuntary
confinement
of
non-dangerous
persons
is
not
constitutionally
justified.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
you
wouldn't
reach
the
right
to
treatment
at
all,
that's
correct
your
honor.
certainly
the
facts
in
this
case
are
clear
and
the
instructions
are
clear
enough
that
that
finding
would
be
appropriate
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
even
though
it
was
not
the
specific
basis
for
decision
below.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
under
these
instructions,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
absolutely
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
petitioner
himself
drafted
and
proposed
an
instruction
specifically
designed
to
cover
that
point
and
that
instruction
was
given.
the
instruction
advised
the
jury
that
if
the
jury
found
that
respondent
did
not
receive
any
treatment
or
any
form
of
treatment
because
of
his
refusal
or
reluctance
to
have
that
form
of
treatment
then
the
jury
could
not
find
liability
or
award
damages
based
on
that
refusal.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
it's
quite
consistent
your
honor
because
first
of
all,
the
verdict
is
rather
modest
i
think
in
this
case
for
a
15-year
deprivation
of
liberty.
but
second,
i
must
respectfully
advise
the
court
that
in
fact
there
was
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
have
found
that
mr.
donaldson
did
not
ever
actually
refused
any
treatment.
he
did
expressly
say
to
the
doctors,
i
prefer
not
to
have
shock
treatment
but
the
doctor
who
was
considering
giving
shock
treatment
testified
at
trial
that
he
did
not
actually
intend
to
give
shock
treatment.
he
only
wanted
to
have
that
possibility
available
should
respondent
become
a
violent
or
disruptive
patient.
that
eventuality
never
occurred
and
shock
treatment
was
never
given.
suddenly
with
respect
to
medication,
i
think
it's
in
the
appendix
at
page
52,
the
respondent
testified
that
petitioner
expressly
told
him
that
so
long
as
he
was
not
a
management
problem
he
would
not
have
to
take
medication.
he
never
was
a
management
problem
and
therefore
he
did
not
have
to
take
medication.
however,
when
he
came
under
the
supervision
of
another
physician,
that
physician
did
urge
upon
respondent
that
he
take
medication
and
at
that
point
respondent
did
take
medication
when
it
was
for
the
first
time
actually
prescribed
for
him.
the
physician
tried
the
medication
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
then
took
respondent
off
the
medication
upon
the
physician's
finding
that
the
medication
had
absolutely
no
effect
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
quarrel
with
that
and
for
the
following
reason.
despite
very
widespread
popular
assumption
to
the
contrary,
it
is
now
quite
clear
that
the
mentally
retarded
even
severely
and
profoundly
retarded
persons
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
even
autistic
persons
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
now
widespread
professional
consensus
that
even
those
persons
are
capable
of
a
great
deal
of
growth
and
improvement.
even
persons
with
iq's
below
19
can
be
taught
to
toilet
themselves,
dress
themselves.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
question
of
course
is
not
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor
let
me
answer
that
question.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me
answer
that
question
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me
say
two
things
first.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
state
cannot
constitutionally
provide
a
custodial
facility
for
voluntary
patients.
the
only
point
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
person
can
be
involuntarily
subjected
to
custodial
care.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
right.
i
just
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
just
close
by
pointing
out
that
there
is
a
book
cited
in
our
brief,
the
discovery
of
the
asylum
by
professor
david
rothman
which
points
that
actually
asylums
were
first
created
in
this
country
not
for
the
purpose
of
providing
custodial
care
but
rather
to
treat
and
cure
patients.
that
was
the
origin
of
the
asylum
in
america.
let
me
close,
your
honor
byst
saying
that
we've
try
to
show
this
is
a
narrow
case
and
properly
understood
does
not
raise
any
novel
rights.
it
involves
only
the
right
to
be
free
from
external
restraint
in
all
that
the
most
compelling
of
circumstances.
we
do
not
believe
those
circumstances
exist
in
this
case
and
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
answer
that
question
by
saying
the
following.
the
petitioners
referred
to
various
habeas
corpus
and
other
types
of
proceedings
brought
by
respondent.
i
have
examined
all
of
the
records
of
those
proceedings
i
can
find
and
i
can
state
to
the
court
that
all
of
those
proceedings
were
dismissed
on
procedural,
jurisdictional
and
other
non-constitutional
grounds
not
relevant
to
the
issues
before
this
case.
there
was
testimony
at
trial
by
respondent
that
he
did
in
fact
attempt
to
use
every
conceivable
statutory
remedy
he
could
use
to
effect
his
release
but
he
never
once
got
a
hearing
and
the
reason
in
fact,
he
did
not
get
a
hearing
is
that
petitioner
opposed
those
hearings
by
supplying
affidavits
to
the
courts
and
stating
that
his
confinement
was
proper.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
without
a
hearing
your
honor.
no
hearings
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
let
me
--
since
the
question
has
been
raised
again,
let
me
read
to
you
briefly
your
honor
one
of
the
--
one
such
decision.
this
is
the
habeas
corpus
or
--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
on
a
habeas
corpus
decision.
this
is
the
entire
decision
in
one
of
those
cases
by
a
county
judge
which
said,
“certainly,
the
state
hospital
authorities
have
no
desire
nor
reason
to
detain
you
in
the
hospital
any
longer
than
your
condition
requires.
in
the
event,
your
condition
is
such
as
to
justify
it
the
medical
staff
will
give
you
a
hearing.”
that
was
a
letter
to
respondent
from
the
county
judge.
that
assumed
that
petitioner
was
acting
in
good
faith
as
it
would
be
reasonable
and
responsible
for
a
judge
to
assume.
but
the
jury
found
in
this
case
that
in
fact
that
judicial
assumption
was
unwarranted.
