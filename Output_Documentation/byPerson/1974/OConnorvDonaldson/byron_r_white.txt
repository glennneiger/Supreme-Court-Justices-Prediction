justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
respect
mr.
gearey,
how
did
it
come
about
that
he
was
finally
released
after
these
many
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
one
who
succeeded
the
doctor
who
is
the
party
then
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
dr.
o'connor
at
all
times
had
the
power
in
the
florida
system
to
release
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
didn't
have
--
did
he
have
the
power
to
release
him
unless
he
arrived
at
that
conclusion
that
he
had
progressed
sufficiently
to
be
released?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
by
adequate
supervision?
this
record
almost
shows
he
didn't
have
any
supervision
here
at
all,
did
he
of
his
confinement?
justice
byron
r.
white
incidentally,
is
it
agreed
on
the
part
of
the
state
and
the
appellants
here
that
mr.
donaldson
was
not
dangerous,
either
to
himself
or
to
others.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
submitted
all
of
those
habeas
applications
incidentally,
all
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
for
one
would
appreciate
it,
if
you
could
supply
information
as
to
those
--
their
citations,
at
least
their
case
numbers
if
they
are
not
reported.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
your
convenience.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
representing
a
state
here
or
hospital
or
dr.
o'connor,
who
are
you
representing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
does
dr.
o'connor
have
separate
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
the
state
paying
the
bill
for
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
have
separate
representation
at
the
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
i
haven't
seen
anything
in
your
brief
or
haven't
heard
anything
here
as
to
whether
in
this
specific
trial
dr.
o'connor
was
properly
charged
with
damages
even
conceding
some
constitutional
right
for
treatment.
for
example,
have
you
preserved
any
objections
to
the
instructions
that
the
trial
court
gave,
other
than
perhaps
some
blanket
objection
to
an
assertion
that
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask,
if
you
preserved
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
is
it
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
or
in
your
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
definition
of
the
constitutional
right
to
treatment?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
given
to
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
you've
argued
about
whether
there
is
one
but
how
about
if
there
is
one,
what
should
it
consist?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
know
very
well
that
that
may
vary
--
if
the
fifth
circuit
or
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
defining
it,
it
might
--
dr.
o'connor
might
not
have
to
pay
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
must
have
some
idea
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
this
case
is
all
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
blame
the
state
for
being
interested
in
(inaudible)
but
dr.
o'connor
has
a
particular
problem
here.
he's
got
a
--
it's
this
law
suit
that
--
i
would
suppose
it
interest
him
as
much
as
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
both
of
them
are
stuck
with
some
damages.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
would
argue
this
case
and
whether
the
--
the
awarded
damages
was
proper
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
there
is
one,
assume
you
lose
on
your
assertion
that
there
is
none.
then
do
you
agree
that
with
this
instruction
that
the
trial
court
gave,
you're
instructed
that
a
person
who
is
involuntarily,
civilly
committed
to
a
mental
hospital
does
have
a
constitutional
right
to
receive
such
treatment
as
will
give
him
a
realistic
opportunity
to
be
cured
or
to
improve
his
mental
condition.
and
that
was
the
instruction.
assume
there
is
a
constitutional
right,
do
you
agree
with
that,
reversion
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
assume
then
that
a
state
violates
its
duty
unless
it
offers
treatment
that
will
give
him
a
realistic
opportunity
to
be
cured
or
to
improve
his
mental
condition.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
is
that
assumed
that
in
every
case
there
is
a
realistic
opportunity
to
be
cured?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
way
it
sounds,
this
instruction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
can
you
agree
with
this
instruction
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
particular
case
happens
to
be
the
one
in
which
this
instruction
was
given.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
but
i
want
to
find
out
if
you
agree
with
this
version,
this
rendition
of
the
right
to
treatment,
if
there
is
one,
as
this
trial
court
instructed
the
jury.
do
you
agree
with
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
case
where
you
--
in
which
as
you
suggest
there
might
not
be
any
realistic
opportunity
to
be
cured?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
this
case
might
be
one
of
those
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
justification
originally
rested
upon
dangerousness.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
you
might
say
that
at
least
they
ought
to
offer
such
treatment,
opportunities
are
reasonably
available
within
the
arc.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
though
that
might
not
give
a
realistic
opportunity
to
be
cured,
i
take
it
there
are
some
conditions
that
aren't
thought
to
be
curable.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
instructions
didn't
though
allow
for
any
case
like
that.
apparently,
the
state
didn't
object
to
those
instructions
that
apparently
accepted
this
case
as
not
being
one,
where
treatment
wouldn't
have
any
chance
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
if
you
would
run
into
a
case
like
that,
perhaps
this
particular
formulation
of
the
right
to
treatment
might
have
to
be
monitory.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
suggesting
i
take
it
that
this
case
should
be
narrowly
decided?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
should
not
try
to
range
for
a
field
on
this
other
--
what
you
called
difficult
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
that
got
to
do
with
this
case?
is
it
filed
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
have
it.
is
this
some
request?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
also
--
and
it
also
doesn't
particularly
confer
to
any
federal
lawful
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we're
dealing
here
with
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
wouldn't
defend
that
instruction
standing
by
itself,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
was
a
proper
instruction
standing
by
itself?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here's
what
the
jury
could've
found
--
could've
based
liability
on,
if
the
doctor
simply
knew
that
the
patient
was
mentally
ill
and
that
he
was
not
receiving
treatment.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
that
is
the
definition
of
the
constitutional
right
to
treatment?
let's
assume
for
example
that
he
was
dangerous.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
asked
you
about
this
instructions
standing
alone.
that
is
not
an
adequate
instruction,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
jury
could've
found
that
simply
could've
based
liability
simply
on
finding
that
he
was
ill
and
not
receiving
treatment
without
regard
to
dangerousness
either
to
himself
or
others.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
i
asked.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
it
corrected?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you
don't
defend
that
prior
instruction
standing
alone?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
example,
assuming
then,
a
patient
is
dangerous
to
himself
or
others,
then
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
right
to
treatment?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the
way
he
amplified
his
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
can
be
found
to
be
in
connection
with
his
commitment
found
to
be
dangerous
to
himself
or
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
had
that
in
the
brief
somewhere
and
i
just
wondered
what
the
truth
with
the
matter
was
since
they're
not
part
of
the
record
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
ask
--
let
me
be
clear
about
one
thing,
suppose
that
the
threshold
of
the
case
you
could
win
your
case
at
least
in
one
way
if
you
--
if
it
were
held
that
there
was
no
--
the
state
had
no
right
to
commit
anybody
just
for
treatment
if
he
was
not
dangerous
to
himself
or
others?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
that
--
have
you
taken
any
position
on
that
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might
avoid
an
awful
lot
of
future
lawsuits
around
in
the
future
litigation
about
the
definition
of
the
right
to
treatment
if
there
was
--
if
the
state
couldn't
confine
people
at
all
unless
they
were
found
to
be
dangerous.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event
there
might
not
be
any
right
to
treatment.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
court
of
appeals
take
the
position
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
issue
ever
raised
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
terms
of
proper
approach
to
constitutional
questions,
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
about
that
issue,
just
leave
it
alone
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
if
we
held
that
in
this
case
we
wouldn't
reach
these
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
jury
had
to
have
found
that
he
was
neither
dangerous
to
himself
or
others.
