mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
raymond
gearey,
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
florida
representing
the
petitioner
dr.
o'connor.
we
have
here
this
morning
the
case
of
kenneth
donaldson,
a
respondent
who
was
involuntarily
civilly
committed
to
the
florida
state
hospital
in
early
1957.
he
was
committed
following
a
hearing
before
a
county
court
judge
where
he
was
found
to
be
mentally
ill,
a
danger
to
himself
and
others
and
at
that
point
was
committed
to
the
hospital
for
care
maintenance
and
treatment
that
being
the
language
of
the
florida
statute
at
that
time.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
it
was
initiated,
i
believe
by
his
family,
his
mother
and
father.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
who
were
residents
of
pinellas
county,
florida.
at
the
time
of
his
admission
among
other
things,
he
requested
due
to
his
christian
scientist
beliefs
that
he
not
be
treated
with
drugs
or
shock
therapy.
now,
throughout
his
hospitalization
those
requests
were
periodically
renewed
and
at
times
he
did
actually
refuse
drug
therapy.
in
addition,
he
frequently
refused
offers
of
various
other
forms
of
therapy
when
they
were
indeed
offered.
these
were
non-medical
forms
therapy
such
as
group
therapy,
occupational
therapy,
etcetera.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well,
mr.
chief
justice
i
believe
at
one
time
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
there
was
some
question
as
to
that.
i
believe
that
in
actuality
it
was
offered,
he
accepted
for
a
time
and
then
refused
to
participate
further
and
i
believe
on
one
other
occasion
when
it
was
offered
he
said
that
he
would
not
participate
again.
there
is
some
question
from
time
to
time
as
to
how
he
reacted
when
the
therapy
was
offered
and
whether
the
therapy
was
explained
to
him
at
the
various
forms.
but
we
believe
that
many
forms
of
therapy
were
indeed
offered
and
were
knowingly
refused
by
mr.
donaldson
for
various
reasons.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well,
he
would've
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
was
in
about
14
years
in
the
hospital.
now,
i
believe
right
up
to
the
end
he
would've
shock
therapy
towards
the
end
of
his
confinement,
the
last
two
years
roughly
i
believe.
he
did
begin
to
agree
to
accept
drug
therapy
from
dr.
gumanas
(ph),
who
was
one
of
the
defendants.
the
drug
therapy
was
tried,
they
felt
it
had
little
or
no
effect
upon
his
illness
and
it
was
discontinued
but
it
was
not
until
the
last
--
approximately
two
years
of
his
hospitalization
that
he
accepted
drug
therapy
at
all.
now,
throughout
his
hospitalization
he
was
tested
and
examined
several
times
by
the
staffs,
psychiatrist,
psychologist,
at
some
occasions
he
would
refuse
to
be
examined.
but
each
time
until
the
end
when
it
was
agreed
he
should
be
released,
the
conclusion
was
always
the
same
that
mr.
donaldson
was
mentally
ill
and
his
confinement
should
continue.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well,
he
received
a
new
attending
physician
late
in
1970
or
early
1971
and
that
attending
physician
determined
that
in
his
judgment
mr.
donaldson
was
indeed
fit
to
be
released
from
the
hospital.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes,
dr.
o'connor,
the
petitioner
whom
i
represent
was
mr.
donaldson's
attending
physician
very
early
in
his
confinement
up
until
1958
or
59.
at
that
time
dr.
o'connor
became
clinical
director
of
the
hospital
and
another
doctor
took
over
mr.
donaldson's
care
and
later
dr.
o'connor
became
superintendent
of
the
hospital.
and
towards
the
end,
the
new
attending
physician
determined
that
mr.
donaldson
had
indeed
that
improved
to
the
point
where
he
should
be
returned
to
society
and
he
was
indeed
released
in
mid
1971,
i
believe
it
was
late
july
or
early
august
and
at
that
time
there
had
also
been
a
change
of
administration
in
the
hospital
and
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
new
superintendent
based
upon
the
reports
given
to
him
by
the
physicians
that
mr.
donaldson
should
be
released.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
did.
and
the
record
reflects
that
at
all
times
during
his
tenure
as
superintendent,
based
upon
the
advice
given
him
by
the
attending
physicians
and
the
consensus
of
staff
conferences
that
mr.
donaldson
should
not
be
released.
now,
at
several
staff
conferences
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
no
mr.
justice
white.
i
believe
dr.
o'connor
stated
and
the
record
reflects
that
he
did
not
believe
that
he
could
release
mr.
donaldson
until
mr.
donaldson
was
cured.
now,
there
were
certain
temporary
forms
of
release
that
were
available.
these
were
such
things
as
trial
visits,
there
was
an
out-of-state
release
procedure
whereby
a
man
although
not
restored
to
his
competency
and
given
a
final
discharge
could
be
released
from
the
hospital
for
temporally
periods
of
time.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
mr.
justice
blackmun
it
was.
towards
the
end
at
one
of
the
last
staff
conferences,
the
consensus
was
that
perhaps
mr.
donaldson
should
be
offered
either
a
trial
visit
or
an
out-of-state
release,
i
believe
they
called
it.
they
offered
him
a
trial
visit
with
his
family
and
he
refused.
and
the
record
reflects
that
quite
accurately.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir
there
were
two
efforts
to
have
mr.
donaldson
released,
one,
mr.
lembcke
and
one
the
helping
hands
organization
in
minnesota.
dr.
o'connor
testified
and
the
other
doctors,
the
record
reflects
believed
that
would've
been
a
disservice
to
mr.
donaldson
to
release
him
at
that
point.
they
felt
him
mentally
ill
and
felt
that
he
could
not
receive
adequate
supervision
from
these
organizations
or
from
mr.
lembcke,
an
individual.
dr.
o'connor
stated
that
at
one
point
he
felt
that
it
would
have
been
a
disservice
to
mr.
donaldson
to
have
released
him.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
he
had
the
supervision
and
the
treatment
that
was
available
at
the
hospital
and
to
which
he
would
submit.
they
believed,
he
didn't
need
supervision
of
the
form
offered
at
the
hospital
was
not
available
from
an
individual
on
the
outside.
dr.
o'connor
firmly
believed
that
mr.
donaldson
remained
mentally
ill
and
that
is
really
the
basis
of
his
refusals.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well,
there
was
some
questions
as
to
that.
now
when
he
was
committed
the
forms
stated
that
he
was
considered
dangerous
to
himself
and
to
others.
in
1965,
mr.
donaldson
had
been
conducting
a
letter
writing
campaign
with
public
officials
protesting
his
hospitalization.
a
member
of
the
legislature
became
concerned
and
requested
an
outside
opinion.
a
doctor
was
brought
in
from
jacksonville
who'd
never
met
mr.
donaldson
before
and
no
contact
with
his
case
prior
to
that
time,
and
his
opinion
was
that
mr.
donaldson
was
mentally
ill
and
indeed
dangerous.
there
were
some
on
the
staff
who
believed
in
dangerous.
there
were
some
who
did
not.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir,
to
some
extent
we
are,
there
was
a
charge
to
that
offend.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well,
i
think
we
would
have
to
say
we
were
bound
by
jury's
finding
on
that
regard
as
they
were
instructed
to
that
effect.
now,
as
i
said
several
times,
the
matter
was
brought
up
to
staff
conference
and
the
consensus
was
and
the
support
dr.
o'connor
relied
upon
that
mr.
donaldson
did
remain
mentally
ill
and
should
be
hospitalized.
now,
throughout
his
hospitalization,
mr.
donaldson
brought
some
14
or
15
suits
seeking
release,
challenging
the
quality
of
his
treatment
and
these
was
brought
in
the
state
courts
and
lower
federal
courts
and
all
were
fairly
summarily
dismissed.
four
of
them
reached
this
court
and
certiorari
was
denied.
this
particular
suit
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
not
all
of
them
are
cited
in
the
brief.
we
did
mention
the
four
that
reached
this
court
and
i
believe
one
or
two
that
reached
the
florida
supreme
court.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
cetainly
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
mr.
justice
powell
i'm
not
certain.
we
have
very
little
knowledge
of
what
did
go
on
in
those
cases.
i
do
not
believe
there
were
any
substantial
evidentiary
hearings
held
in
any
of
those
cases.
but
that
would
be
have
--
that
would
have
to
be
something
we
would
have
to
further
research
and
the
information
wasn't
available
to
us
at
the
time
we
submitted
the
case
to
you.
but
i
would
--
i
think
i
could
safely
say
that
the
evidentiary
hearings
were
not
held.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
believe
there
were
just
summary
dismissals
for
lack
of
--
a
case
of
controversy
or
lack
of
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
okay,
under
the
florida
law
in
1957,
the
law
required
a
petition
on
behalf
of
a
number
of
citizens
that
they
felt
--
a
particular
individual
needed
--
who
was
mentally
ill
needed
care.
the
due
process
procedures
which
were
present
were
a
notice,
a
hearing,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
at
the
hearing
on
all
relevant
evidence.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
before
a
county
court
judge.
it
was
a
judicial
hearing
in
all
respects
and
the
subject,
the
patient
of
the
--
subject
of
the
petition
had
the
right
to
counsel
or
appointed
counsel
and
there
were
provisions
in
the
statute
for
the
indigents
who
could
not
supply
witness
fees
or
other
related
fees,
the
state
would
waive
those.
and
so,
we
believe
it
was
a
full
hearing
with
full
due
process.
now,
that's
one
element
of
what
really
goes
into
this
alleged
right
to
treatment
which
i
will
begin
into
shortly.
but
to
summarize
it
briefly,
he
received
full
due
process,
a
notice,
hearing,
witnesses,
counsel
if
desired
and
there
was
expert
testimony
from
the
two
physicians.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
no
sir,
it
is
not.
the
petitions
that
were
filled
at
the
time
our
part
of
the
record.
i
don't
believe
that
a
transcript
or
copy
of
the
hearing
is
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
i
believe
release
was
available
on
petition
from
the
patient.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
believe
under
the
statutes
at
that
time
there
were
several
ways
the
patient
could
receive
release
and
a
petition
from
the
patient
was
one
of
them.
if
he
felt
he
was
cured
he
could
petition
for
a
release
and
a
hearing
would
apparently
have
been
held.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
he
would
have
petitioned
the
court
which
had
committed
him
originally.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
no
sir,
not
into
this
case
that
i'm
aware
off.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
under
the
1957
law
--
i
feel
the
burden
probably
would
have
been
on
the
patient
to
have
shown
that
he
was
cured.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well,
i
--
that's
really
the
question
here
whether
there
had
been
treatment
and
of
course
we
submit
that
there
was
treatment.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
it
was
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
no,
there
was
none.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes,
i
expect
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
right.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes,
that's
correct.
now,
this
suit
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
would
have
been
under
that
procedure.
if
it
had
been
shown
at
that
time
under
the
57th
statute
that
he
was
still
in
need
of
treatment
with
or
without
dangerousness,
i
believe
he
may
have
still
been
retained
at
the
hospital.
florida
law
has
drastically
changed
since
the
57
procedure
and
i
will
mention
briefly
later
that
under
our
new
law
no
patient
is
really
kept
more
than
six
months
without
a
repeat
hearing
and
that
we
do
recognize
now
a
statutory
right
to
treatment.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
that's
correct,
after
six
months
every
patient
is
reviewed.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
that's
conducted
at
the
hospital
before
a
hearing
examiner.
and
at
that
point
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
he
in
need
of
further
in-institution
treatment
he
must
be
released
either
to
a
community
program
or
released
entirely.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
would
be
and
in
addition
he
would
again
be
reviewed
periodically.
it's
a
periodic
process
with
regular
review.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
is.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes.
at
this
present
time
we
have
one
hearing
examiner
who
handles
this
particular
institution.
he
is
employed
by
the
state.
but
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
oh!
no.
not
at
all.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
he
reports
to
--
to
relate
it
to
the
department
of
health
and
rehabilitative
services
that
supervises
the
hospital
but
has
proven
to
be
a
very
much
an
adversary
process.
the
hearing
examiner
has
shown
himself
to
be
quite
independent
of
the
state.
now,
this
suit
was
instituted
somewhat
before
mr.
donaldson
was
released
and
originally
sought
release
and
damages
for
his
confinement
allegedly
without
treatment.
after
his
release
the
action
was
converted
to
a
civil
rights
suit
eventually
seeking
damages
from
several
physicians
who
had
treated
him
and
the
superintendents
of
the
hospital.
the
case
went
to
trial
and
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
$38,000
against
two
of
the
physicians,
dr.
o'connor
and
dr.
gumanas
(ph).
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
was
brought
to
this
court
and
granted.
now
on
constitutional
right
to
treatment
which
is
our
first
issue,
we
want
--
state
of
florida
wants
to
make
it
clear
that
we
agree
that
persons
involuntarily
civilly
committed
to
state
metal
institutions
have
a
right
to
be
treated.
in
florida
this
is
handled
by
a
statute.
however,
we
are
concerned
for
the
theory
of
a
constitutional
right.
there
is
no
expressed
constitutional
right
to
treatment.
as
such
we
recognized
that
if
there
is
one
it
should
flow
from
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
florida
would
not
willingly
transform
hospitals
into
jails.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
there
is
indeed
a
constitutional
right
to
treatment
flowing
from
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
said
that
and
really
nothing
more.
there
are
not
guidelines
to
guide
the
federal
judiciary
and
the
enforcement
of
this
right
and
this
is
where
we
feel
the
important
problem
comes
and
this
is
where
the
idea
breaks
down.
we
accept
and
we
agree
with
this
court's
statement
in
jackson
versus
indiana
that
the
nature
and
duration
of
confinement
must
bear
some
reasonable
relationship
to
the
purpose
for
which
the
person
is
committed.
now,
our
problem
with
the
constitutional
right
to
treatment
is
what
is
treatment
and
how
do
we
measure
it.
mr.
donaldson
was
committed
for
treatment.
it
was
the
state's
position
throughout
this
that
he
receives
such
treatment
as
was
available
and
to
which
he
would
submit.
however,
we
do
quarrel
with
the
ruling
of
the
fifth
circuit
for
what
we
consider
to
be
important
issues.
examination
of
due
process
requires
more
than
looking
at
the
quality
and
quantity
of
treatment.
you
first
have
to
examine
the
due
process
received
in
the
commitment
procedures
which
we've
just
briefly
outlined
here.
and
then
you
have
to
get
to
this,
the
important
step
of
judging
the
quality
and
quantity
of
the
treatment
and
thus
far,
we
have
a
lack
of
meaningful
guidelines
to
enforce
this
right,
a
right
incapable
of
enforcement
to
us
cannot
truly
be
a
right.
from
1957
to
1971
there
were
no
judicial
statements
that
a
constitutional
right
to
treatment
existed
and
there
were
certainly
no
guidelines
to
measure
that
right
and
there
are
none
now.
and
we
seriously
question
whether
the
federal
judiciary
is
adequately
equipped
without
more
in
the
way
of
guidelines
to
sit
down
and
examine
a
patients'
treatment
program
and
adequately
pick
and
choose
among
dozens
of
treatment
therapies
and
program
plans.
but
quite
seriously
the
state
of
florida
is
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
under
the
review
in
the
new
statute,
hearing
examiner
examines
to
the
extent
of
whether
the
treatment
being
received
is
reasonably
designed
to
accomplish
the
purpose.
he
doesn't
get
in
to
the
specifics
that
were
implied
in
this
case.
it's
a
general
review
of
the
treatment
being
received.
if
he
finds
that
no
treatment
is
being
received,
the
patient
is
no
longer
hospitalized
certainly.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
the
patient?
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
mr.
chief
justice
that
is.
now,
the
hearing
examiner
examines
that
the
treatment
to
the
extent
that
whether
the
physicians
have
made
a
permissible
decision
in
their
treatment
plans.
he
does
not
get
to
the
specifics.
and
now,
we
are
haunted
by
the
inspector
of
federal
courts
ordering
a
particular
plan.
as
we
stated
in
our
brief
there
have
been
cases
that
have
been
brought
in
the
federal
courts,
criminal
cases
where
a
judge
has
found
a
man
to
be
possibly
unfit
to
stand
trial
for
reasons
of
insanity.
he
would
have
the
man
examined
by
two
eminent
qualified
psychiatrists
who
would
indeed
agree
this
man
should
not
stand
trial
at
this
time,
he
needs
care
and
treatment.
the
judge
would
then
say
what
treatment
should
he
have?
one
eminent
psychiatrist
would
say,
“well,
he
should
be
treated
in
a
more
physical
way,
a
more
medicinal
way
with
drugs
and
various
forms
of
medicinal
therapy.”
the
other
would
say,
“no,
no,
he
should
be
treated
as
more
psychiatric,
psychological
approach
without
the
drugs
and
medicinal
therapies.”
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
no,
a
criminal
defendant
would
not
be
within
the
ambit
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
but
i
think
that's
very
in
--
the
problem
of
the
judge
is
very
analogous
where
he
is
presented
with
the
two
psychiatrists
who
disagree
and
want
to
propose
treatment
programs
should
be
to
ensure
that
the
man
receives
the
treatment
he
deserves.
and
this
is
what
bothers
us,
are
we
going
to
have
federal
judiciary
saying,
“yes
sir,
it
is
the
right
to
treatment
but
not
giving
us
the
guidelines
to
enforce
it.”
now
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
no
sir
it
doesn't
and
we
do
believe
that
we
are
offering
the
treatment
that
we
do
indeed
promise.
now
the
burning
issue
in
this
as
far
as
the
guidelines
is
that
at
the
time
of
mr.
donaldson's
hospitalization.
there
were
no
guidelines.
there
was
no
right
and
yet
in
1971
the
right
was
enforced
retroactively.
back
to
1957
and
resulted
in
personal
liability,
dr.
o'connor
had
before
him
a
man
judicially
committed.
his
decision
to
release
mr.
donaldson
is
a
quasi-judicial
decision.
now
we
skipped
to
the
liability
question
here
but
we
don't
believe
that
under
those
circumstances,
dr.
o'connor
should
have
been
held
liable
for
making
that
decision.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
certainly,
certainly.
our
point
is
that
as
far
as
a
right
to
treatment
goes,
that
point
to
the
state
of
florida,
not
dr.
o'connor
is
moot
prospectively.
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
constitutional
right
to
treatment
though
the
states
--
and
this
is
a
broad
issue
among
many
states.
need
some
sort
of
guidelines,
without
those
guidelines
we
deny
the
existence
of
the
right
as
un-enforceful.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well
mr.
justice
white
i
represent
in
a
way
both
the
state
and
dr.
o'connor.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
no
sir,
he
does
not.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
we
are
paying
the
bill
for
his
representation,
however
the
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
no.
there's
no
provision
under
florida
law
at
that
time
for
the
payment
of
damages.
these
are
personal
damages
under
the
civil
rights
act.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
no
he
did
not.
he
was
represented
by
a
state
counsel.
we
represent
dr.
o'connor
and
in
his
capacity
as
a
former
state
employee
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes.
objections
were
made
to
the
instructions.
one
in
particular,
that
troubles
us
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
we
have.
i
believe
that
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
oh!
i
think
it's
implied
in
there
that
that's
what
we're
arguing
about
is
the
way
this
case
was
presented
to
the
jury
by
the
district
court.
a
good
faith
instruction
was
given
that
said
good
faith
is
a
defense
but
it
is
not
a
defense.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
that's
the
point
we've
argued
about
through
the
fifth
circuit
to
this
court.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well,
that's
a
point
that
we
haven't
raised
in
the
brief.
we
don't
know
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
that's
correct.
now,
we
don't
know
how
it
should
be
defined
and
that's
a
problem--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir
we
do.
we
feel
that
the
courts
have
given
the
states
due
process
guidelines
in
areas
such
as
parole
revocation,
criminal
trials
and
this
is
something
similar
when
the
right
is
announced,
guidelines
should
be
announced
at
that
time
in
order
to
aid
the
states
in
the
enforcement
of
the
right.
we
believe
that
as
the
fifth
circuit
ruled,
it's
unenforceable.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
oh!
we've
argued
that.
in
this
case,
it
certainly
was
not.
it
results
in
a
retroactive
application
of
a
brand
new
doctrine.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it
could,
no.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
no.
he
gave
an
instruction
stating
that
there
was
indeed
a
constitutional
right.
and
this
is
the
point
that
to
us
is
basic,
essential
error.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
we
would
agree
with
that.
but
our
disagreement
with
that
in
this
case
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
the
state
violates
its
duty
if
it
doesn't
give
him
such
treatment
as
it
has
promised
him
to
make
him
well.
the
problem
in
this
case
however
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
oh!
no,
no,
not
at
all.
well
if
the
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
it's
limited
to
available
cures
that
are
available
within
the
state
system.
certainly
the
state
should
make
available
all
cures
possible.
however,
there
are
some
illnesses
which
virtually
cannot
be
cured.
there
are
others
which
not
--
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well,
we
don't
agree
with
it
in
this
case.
we
agree
with
it
in
the
case
where
it
has
been
shown
that
when
a
man
has
a
disorder
that
can
be
reasonably
cured
by
therapy.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes
sir.
now,
the
problem
with
it
in
this
case
is,
that
instruction
assumes
the
existing,
the
existence
of
the
right
to
treatment
and
our
point
is,
yes,
there
may
be
a
right
to
treatment
now.
but
in
1957
to
71,
there
was
none.
and
so
it's
wrong.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
if
there
is
one,
if
there
is
one
prospectively,
i
think
we
could
agree
with
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well,
that
would
raise
a
problem.
it's
not
considered
by
that
instruction.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
on
the
record
we
could
say
that
there
was
no
hope
of
curing
mr.
donaldson.
there
is
some
question
as
far
as
his
disease
goes
as
to
whether
even
a
one
to
one
doctor-patient
relationship
would
have
any
effect.
the
outcome
seems
to
be
more
disorder,
the
disease
than
the
type
or
amount
of
treatment.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
if
he
was
--
excuse
me.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
there
was
a
finding
in
the
commitment
papers
that
he
was
dangerous
to
himself
and
to
others.
there
was
conflicting
testimony
at
trial
as
to
the
opinion
of
the
psychiatrist
as
to
whether
he
was
indeed
dangerous.
now
in
'65,
the
outside
psychiatrist
said,
“yes,
he
is
dangerous.”
other
doctors
said,
“no,
he
isn't.”
and
of
course
that's
a
matter
for
psychiatric
opinion.
thank
you.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
well,
in
this
case,
yes
sir.
the
psychiatric
opinion
was
conflicting
and
it
went
to
the
jury.
apparently
the
jury
resolved
it
in
favor
of
mr.
donaldson.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
yes.
i
think
we'd
have
to
assume
that.
mr.
raymond
w.
gearey,
jr.
no,
they
couldn't
have.
