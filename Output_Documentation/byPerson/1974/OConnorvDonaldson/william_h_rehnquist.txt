justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
this
fellow
mr.
lembcke
in
new
york
tried
it
for
years
to
get
him
released.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
aren't
you
bound
by
the
jury's
verdict
to
a
certain
extent
on
that.
didn't
the
district
judge
charge
that
in
order
for
them
to
recover
they
would
have
to
find
he
was
not
dangerous?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
what
extent
aren't
you
bound
by
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can't
see
why
you
can't
really
limit
your
discussion
of
the
case
to
the
particular
facts
before
us.
there're
obviously
broader
issues
involved
but
a
case
like
you
mentioned
for
that
that
man
could
reasonably
be
found
dangerous,
i
would
think.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
therefore
really
not
within
the
ambit
of
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
in
this
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
florida
has
apparently
elected
to
say
that
a
man
who
was
competently
at
least
by
this
jury's
definition
and
not
dangerous
to
himself
and
not
dangerous
to
others
can
nonetheless
be
virtually,
totally
deprived
of
his
liberty
and
the
expectation
i
suppose
is
what
he
gets
in
return,
its
some
form
of
treatment.
does
it
seem
fair
to
you
that
the
state
entirely
renege
on
each
side
of
the
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
could
reach
that
result
quite
apart
from
the
existence
of
a
right
to
treatment.
or
anyone
could
hold
there
was
a
right
to
treatment
and
still
--
because
of
some
application
of
a
privilege
doctrine,
say
that
this
particular
defendant
shouldn't
have
been
liable
here,
i
suppose.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
that's
the
case,
what's
the
justification
for
florida's
confining
and
if
he
wasn't
dangerous
to
himself,
wasn't
dangerous
to
others
and
was
competent
if
there
is
virtually
no
possibility
of
curing
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
did
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
it
did
originally
rest
upon
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
instruction
doesn't
say
legally
proper,
it
just
says
proper
so
it
doesn't
really
draw
the
distinction
that
they
believed
in
good
faith
that
it
was
lawful
but
in
fact
it
turned
out
not
to
have
been
lawful.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
that's
not
preserved
by
objection.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
mean
that
that
man
was
found
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
if
somebody
is
found
not
guilty
of
first
degree
murder
by
a
reason
of
insanity
and
that
he
can
petition
for
a
federal
habeas
corpus
and
be
released
if
he
can
prove
that
he
is
not
really
receiving
satisfactory
treatment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
mean
then
or
that
only
somebody
who
has
committed
through
the
criminal
process
by
a
criminal
trial
is
exempt
from
this
requirement
for
treatment.
you
would
extend
it
to
something
with
quasi-criminal
overtones?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
--
well,
if
--
but
your
underlying
theory
has
to
either
embrace
it
or
not
embrace
it,
i
would
think?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
you
talk
about
criminally
confined
persons
you
include
a
person
who
is
found
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
committed
as
a
result
of
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it's
not
essential
to
your
success
here
that
you
re-litigate
a
finding
of
dangerousness
that
might
have
been
made
in
the
1957
proceeding.
