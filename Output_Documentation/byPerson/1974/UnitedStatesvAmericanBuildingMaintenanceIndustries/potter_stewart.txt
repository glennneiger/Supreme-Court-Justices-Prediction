justice

stewart
but
the
amendment
simply
added
the
acquisition
of
assets
to
stock
acquisition,
that
was
basically
what
it
did,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
that's
what
i
thought
and
it
--
does
it
carry
a
very
far
to
--
now
you
undoubtedly
must
think
it
does
because
you
spend
a
good
deal
of
time
in
your
brief
on
oral
argument
but
i
wonder
how
far
does
it
carry
you
just
to
say
that
congress
intended
to
implement,
add
to,
effectuate,
amplify
the
sherman
act
both
in
1914
and
again
in
1950
when
it
enacted
and
then
amended
the
clayton
act
because
we
--
it's
clear
from
the
language
of
the
clayton
act
that
in
many
ways
it
did
add
to
the
sherman
act
but
in
certain
other
ways,
it
very
clearly
have
--
was
more
limited
than
the
sherman
act
quite
apart
from
the
question
now
before
us.
for
example,
the
sections
--
what
is
now
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
applies
only
to
corporations,
whereas,
the
sherman
act
applies
to
individual
people
as
well
as
corporations.
now,
that
certainly
is
a
more
limiting
jurisdictional
coverage,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
argue
about
what
jurisdictional
means
but
certainly
no
matter
how
strangling
of
competition
potentially
at
least,
the
acquisition
of
an
individual
person's
assets
might
be
even
though
that
person
was
engaged
in
commerce
by
somebody
else
engaged
in
commerce,
section
7
simply
doesn't
reach
it
as
a
matter
--
justice
potter
stewart
statutory
scope
or
jurisdiction
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
precisely.
justice
potter
stewart
precisely.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
the
--
well,
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
and
there's
no
doubt
that
if
congress
wanted
to
exercise
their
full
power,
the
same
sherman
act
power
and
with
respect
to
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
they
could,
everybody
agrees
on
that.
the
only
question
is
here,
did
they?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
brother's
answer
is
no,
they
didn't?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
section
of
the
country
can
be
purely
intrastate?
justice
potter
stewart
as
it
was
in
von's
for
example
--
justice
potter
stewart
as
alleged
to
be
here.
justice
potter
stewart
or
as
alleged
to
be
here?
justice
potter
stewart
southern
california
again?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
case,
we
entertain
an
appeal
from
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california.
the
government
commence
this
civil
antitrust
action
in
that
court
contending
that
the
appellee,
american
building
maintenance
industries,
had
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
by
acquiring
the
stock
of
the
j.e.
benton
management
corporation
and
by
merging
the
benton
maintenance
company
into
one
of
its
wholly
owned
subsidiaries.
following
discovery
proceedings
and
the
submission
of
memoranda
and
affidavits
by
both
parties,
the
district
court
granted
the
appellee's
motion
for
summary
judgment,
holding
that
there
had
been
no
violation
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
because
neither
of
the
benton
companies
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
the
government
then
brought
this
direct
appeal
here
and
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
for
the
reasons
set
out
on
a
written
opinion
of
the
court,
the
judgement
of
the
district
court
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
at
all
but
--
but
one
part
of
the
court's
opinion.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined
and
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
