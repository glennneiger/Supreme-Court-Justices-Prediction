f.
powell,

mr.
wilson,
on
page
36
of
your
brief
at
the
top
of
the
page
of
the
first
sentence
states
that
previous
section
7
cases
have
involved
both
acquiring
and
acquired
firms
that
have
been
engaged
in
the
floor
of
commerce.
i
take
that
to
mean
that
this
is
the
first
case
the
justice
department
had
brought
in
which
the
acquired
firm
was
not
engaged
in
commerce,
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
referred
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
congress
in
1914
with
the
limitation
of
the
sherman
act.
has
congress
indicated
any
dissatisfaction
with
the
failure
of
a
justice
department
to
bring
this
type
of
suit
before
in
the
last
60
years?
