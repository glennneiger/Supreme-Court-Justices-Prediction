justice
byron
r.
white
had
the
department
taken
out
after
any
merger
such
as
this
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
give
me
a
couple
of
examples?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
wasn't
a
question,
that
wasn't
the
question
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wouldn't
do
and
suggest
the
department
regularly
since
1914
as
to
take
in
this
position
and
has
attempted
to
apply
the
act
to
corporations
that
were
engaged
solely
in
intrastate
commerce.
let's
just
assume
that
they
were
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
it
or
has
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
refused
to
put
the
words
affecting
commerce
in
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
though
there
have
been
--
i'll
put
it
this
way,
there
have
been
proposals.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
certainly
wouldn't
rely
on
a
failure
to
amend
the
statute
to
show
that
congress
expresses
some
dissatisfaction
or
is
the
way
the
department
of
justice
for
enforcing
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
other
evidence
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
then
that
the
--
under
your
--
under
the
department's
position
now
that
the
act
don't
mean
exactly
the
same
if
the
words
engaged
in
commerce
or
any
act
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
lets
just
take
them
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
take
them
out.
no
corporation
shall
acquire
directly
or
indirectly
the
whole
or
any
part
of
the
stock
of
any
other
corporation
if
the
effect
would
be
to
substantiate
us
in
competition
with
any
line
of
commerce.
the
act
would
be
precisely
what
you
say
it
is
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
way
you
want
to
construe
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
those
are
just
surpassing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
must
take
that
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
this
was
inadvertence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
--
you
think
--
you
don't
think
this
case
was
brought,
was
the
idea
of
reaching
farther
with
section
7
that
hadn't
been
reached
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
take
the
idea
in
the
first
place
was
that
these
corporations
were
engaged
to
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
--
suppose
one
of
these
building
companies
are
both
--
say
both
the
janitor
companies,
maintenance
companies
were
--
bought
a
couple
of
$100,000.00
a
year
of
piece
of
goods
from
outer
state,
would
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
they
would
have
--
to
some
extent
they
would
be
then
engaged
in
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
they
--
well
yes,
for
jurisdictional
purposes.
justice
byron
r.
white
they'd
still
have
--
they'd
have
a
problem
of
proof
about
the
line
of
commerce
of
whether
there
would
be
affect
on
commerce.
but
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
they
would
have
been
in
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they've
--
all
their
supplies
or
most
of
their
supplies,
they
buy
it
from
out
of
state
directly,
let's
assume
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
instead
of
buying
from
10
suppliers
from
out
of
state,
they
buy
it
from
wholesaler
in
california
who
buys
in
turn
all
those
supplies
from
out
of
state,
you
see
that
breaks
the
flow.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
will
change
my
--
let's
assume
that
you
would
concede
that
if
they
bought
directly
from
out
of
state,
they
would
be
engaged
in
commerce
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
know
you
don't
want
to
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
it
makes
all
the
difference
if
they
--
instead
of
doing
it
directly,
they
buy
from
a
wholesaler,
from
the
california
wholesaler?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
changes
the
case
completely,
no
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
would
be
the
legal
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
flow
of
commerce
has
broken
with
the
wholesaler?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
some
--
some
clayton
act
cases,
jurisdictional
cases
on
that
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
aren't
any,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
those
distributors
also
shows,
those
distributors
buy
from
out
of
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
distributor?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
have
any
figures
on
what
these
two
maintenance
companies
bought,
what
supplies
they
bought
that
had
the
origin
on
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
in
--
are
you
suggesting
in
your
argument
that
in
order
to
--
of
course
that
the
issue
is
not
here
i
take
it
but
are
you
suggesting
that
the
--
that
to
satisfy
the
latter
part
of
section
7,
the
impact
on
any
line
of
commerce,
that
the
impact,
the
substantially
lessening
of
competition
would
have
to
result
only
from
activities
in
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
effect
on
the
line
of
commerce
could
be
delivered
by
wholly
intrastate?
justice
byron
r.
white
okay,
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
government
abandoned
the
notion
that
these
companies
were
engaged
in
commerce?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
they
were
engaged
in
commerce
without
having
to
rely
on
the
effect
notion?
i
mean
you
certainly
argue
in
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
argue
that
--
you
argue
that
these
people
were
sufficiently
dealing
directly
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis
you
don't
need
any
change,
any
redefinition
of
engaged
in
commerce
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
not
abandoning
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
charge
to
the
district
court's
findings.
