mr.
marcus
mattson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
the
court
please.
i'm
not
here
to
deny
the
clayton
act
was
intended
to
reach
areas
not
reached
by
the
sherman
act.
i'm
not
here
to
deny
that
as
to
specifically
limited
transactions
and
specifically
limited
entities,
congress
exercised
far
reaching
commerce
powers
or
that
they
exercised
all
of
their
commerce
power,
i
don't
--
only
history
can
tell
because
only
ingenuity
can
define
how
far
those
powers
go.
obviously,
congress
exercised
its
power
only
with
regard
to
acquisitions.
contrary
to
the
sherman
act,
it
was
every
contract.
it
exercised
in
clayton
7
only
with
regarded
corporations
engaged
in
commerce.
now,
this
court
has
already
said
in
gulf
oil
versus
copp
that
that
language
appears
to
denote
only
persons
or
activities
within
the
flow
of
interstate
commerce,
the
practical,
economic
continuity
in
generation
of
goods
and
services
for
interstate
markets
and
their
transport
and
distribution
to
the
consumer.
with
that
legal
principle,
the
past
enforcement
pattern
of
the
department
of
justice
has
until
now
agreed
as
mr.
justice
powell
has
indicated
from
page
36
of
the
government's
brief,
this
case
marks
the
advent
of
a
new
policy
in
the
department
of
justice
in
the
enforcement
of
the
clayton
act
7.
and
the
fact
that
this
policy
as
stated
on
page
36
of
the
government's
brief
precisely
conforms
with
the
explicit
terms
of
section
7
is
according
to
the
government's
intimation
only
coincidental.
this
conformity
says
the
government,
simply
reflects
the
fact
that
the
government
has
devoted
its
limited
enforcement
resources
to
areas
where
the
need
is
most
pressing.
the
government's
new
so-called
application
of
the
statute
and
i
was
surprised
to
hear
that
counsel
now
says
that
the
words
that
we
rely
on
are
surpluses.
but
they
now
--
they
say
in
their
briefs
that
their
application
is
that
the
words
engaged
in
commerce
includes
not
only
activities
in
the
flow
of
commerce
but
also
local
activities
that
substantially
affect
interstate
commerce
and
those
are
their
words.
the
statute
of
course
is
doubly
explicit
to
the
contrary
not
only
must
they
acquire
incorporation
be
engaged
in
commerce
but
also
the
acquired
corporation
must
be
engaged
also
in
commerce.
the
repetition
of
those
terms
demonstrates
that
they
were
obviously
important
to
congress.
this
importance
has
until
now
and
for
more
than
60
years
than
recognized
by
the
department
of
justice
as
it's
passed
enforcement
pattern
and
that's
what
it
caused
it.
there
are
additionally
important
features
in
the
record
which
indicate
that
the
new
policy
of
the
department
of
justice
was
not
in
mind
when
it
initiated
this
case.
and
as
not
even
yet
given
it
adequate
consideration,
thus
file
the
government
positively
states
on
page
36
again
that
it
is
true
and
this
is
the
government's
words.
it
is
true
that
previous
section
7
cases
have
involved
both
acquiring
and
acquired
firms
engaged
in
the
flow
of
commerce.
mr.
marcus
mattson
i
think
that
this
was
--
that
this
--
their
argument
that
they're
making
in
their
brief
and
their
argument
they
make
today
is
an
effort
to
reach
a
problem
which
arose
in
this
case
and
this
is
the
first
time
that
they've
used
it
as
a
means
of
taking
care
of
this
case.
mr.
marcus
mattson
i
do
not.
mr.
marcus
mattson
i
thought
perhaps
they
felt
that
they're
--
they
hardly
conceive
that
there
was
anyone
who
had
such
local
operation
as
the
benton
corporation.
they
assumed
that
everybody
could
be
included
within
commerce.
they
didn't
understand
what
the
janitorial
business
was
about
when
they
brought
the
case.
and
that's
my
judgment
as
to
why
this
case
was
bought
--
brought.
now,
they
say
in
their
--
to
continue
and
may
perhaps
this
is
along
the
line
of
your
idea
mr.
justice
white.
they
say
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
department
of
justice
has
never
taken
that
position
that
is
that
the
--
that
they
had
a
past
enforcement
pattern
along
the
lines.
they
say
that
they
had
in
--
on
page
36
of
their
brief
in
chief.
so
they
go
out
of
their
860
year
history
under
section
7.
they
were
able
to
select
only
two
cases
to
support
the
denial
of
what
they
said
in
page
--
on
page
36.
one
was
the
bennington
national
bank
case.
now,
every
one
knows
that
banks
are
engaged
in
commerce.
that's
a
long
since
been
decided,
there
are
no
question
about
it.
so,
that
case
doesn't
indicate
one
way
or
another.
the
other
is
the
von's
shopping
bag
case.
there,
the
government
proved
its
allegation
that
both
the
acquired
and
the
acquiring
corporations
were
supermarket
chains
and
its
allegation
and
i
read
from
the
complaint,
such
chains
operate
purchasing
offices
which
are
in
contact
with
suppliers
located
throughout
the
united
states
to
purchase
and
affect
the
shipment
of
substantial
quantities
of
groceries
and
related
products
from
producing
facilities
located
in
the
various
states
to
the
change
distribution
centers
and
supermarkets
in
the
los
angeles
area.
the
facts
here
would
not
support
any
such
allegation
and
none
was
made.
and
as
mr.
justice
white
asked,
we
looked
--
we
--
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
if
the
government
had
in
mind
a
new
application
of
the
statute,
a
new
extension
of
the
statute
and
was
prepared
to
prove
it,
its
complaint
would
have
reflected
these
facts
and
yet
you
look
in
vein
for
any
allegation
in
this
complaint
that
benton,
the
acquired
corporation
was
engaged
in
local
activities
that
substantially
affected
interstate
commerce,
there's
nothing
of
that
in
the
complaint.
if
you
look
in
vein
for
any
allegation
which
would
describe
the
commerce
so
affected
or
which
was
state
--
what
the
effect
had
been?
the
most
that
is
found
are
the
allegations
in
paragraph
8
of
the
complaint
that
the
acquiring
corporation
maintains
offices
and
serves
customers
in
various
states
of
the
united
states.
but
as
to
benton,
the
acquired
corporation,
there
is
no
comparable
allegation.
as
to
benton,
it
is
alleged
only
that
some
of
its
customers
and
some
of
its
vendors
were
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
this
state
of
the
pleadings,
evidences
and
inconsistency
with
the
government's
new
application
of
the
statute
and
shows
a
total
disregard
of
the
explicit
jurisdictional
requirements
of
the
statute.
i
mentioned
that
i
didn't
think
they
understood
the
janitorial
service
business
and
i
think
that
perhaps
that's
one
of
their
basic
failures
in
bringing
this
case
to
start
with.
mr.
marcus
mattson
no,
i
don't
think
they
could
support
the
situation
at
all.
i'm
only
indicating
that
because
there
seem
to
be
a
question
that
why
did
they
bring
this
case
at
all.
and
that
my
only
indication
is
from
the
complaint
itself,
they
didn't
have
a
basis.
they
made
a
mistake.
now,
janitors
don't
manufacture
a
product.
they
don't
sell
a
product.
their
raw
material
is
unskilled
labor
which
necessarily
must
be
obtained
locally
for
the
rendering
of
a
local
service.
janitors
can't
go
in
to
other
than
their
local
areas
to
compete
for
unskilled
labor
their
raw
material
or
to
get
it
at
lower
price.
a
janitorial
firm
can
of
course
expand
and
go
national
as
the
acquiring
corporations
in
here
or
it
can
elect
to
remain
local
as
benton,
the
acquired
corporations
here.
of
course,
janitors
need
mops,
pails,
soap
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
these
supplies
are
incidental
and
are
extensively
available
from
local
vendors
just
as
they
are
to
the
local
housewife.
benton
to
an
extraordinary
degree
limited
these
activities
to
the
southern
california
area.
when
the
government's
discovery
efforts
developed
at
benton's
interstate
purchases
aggregative
$140.00
and
then
its
interstate
telephone
calls
cost
only
$19.78,
the
government
was
driven
to
a
conceding
in
its
footnote
number
5
that
benton's
interstate
purchases
were
admittedly
small.
further
confirmation
of
that
fact
is
--
and
the
fact
that
benton's
operation
were
intensely
local,
it's
shown
by
the
fact
that
no
officer,
no
employee
of
benton
traveled
outside
of
california
on
business.
there
is
every
evidence
that
mr.
benton
who
founded
the
business
was
convinced
that
if
he
satisfied
the
local
people.
that
if
he
cleaned
their
buildings
properly
and
they
were
the
one
with
whom
he
had
to
a
deal.
he
need
not
waste
the
firm's
money
on
any
non-essentials
connected
with
interstate
commerce.
there's
--
i
think
the
government
also
started
from
a
false
premise
as
to
the
legislative
history.
we
were
willing
--
we
would
have
found
no
necessity
of
going
to
legislative
history
because
the
statute
is
explicit.
it
was
the
government
that
went
to
the
legislative
history
here.
and
the
unrestricted
freedom
with
which
the
government
exercised
their
reference
to
the
explicit
language
of
section
7
is
based
upon
a
misunderstanding
of
the
legislative
record.
the
government
persist
in
urging
that
congress
had
not
considered
the
meaning
of
the
words
engaged
also
in
commerce
in
connection
with
section
7.
that
of
course
is
an
unflattering
conclusion
because
the
legislators
must
have
known
that
they
were
putting
that
language
in
at
least.
mr.
marcus
mattson
you
mean
directly
from
out
of
state?
mr.
marcus
mattson
you
would
have
a
more
difficult
question.
mr.
marcus
mattson
they
might
have
come
within
--
then
come
within
part
of
the
government's
contention
if
you
could
prove
that
those
purchases
affected
interstate
commerce.
mr.
marcus
mattson
yes.
mr.
marcus
mattson
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede
that.
i
think
the
words
engaged
in
commerce
means
that
you
have
a
business
which
does
--
which
is
day
to
day
engaged
in
commerce.
mr.
marcus
mattson
if
that's
an
assumption,
it
is
possible
to
so
state.
i
think
however,
their
basis
--
mr.
marcus
mattson
yes
i
do.
and
moreover,
i
would
say
if
they
bought
directly,
it
maybe
that
that
is
an
incidental
part
of
their
business.
and
then
i
go
back
to
the
fact
that
the
janitorial
business
is
local.
mr.
marcus
mattson
i'm
willing
to
start
in
that
assumption.
mr.
marcus
mattson
right.
mr.
marcus
mattson
right.
mr.
marcus
mattson
that's
the
assumption.
yes.
mr.
marcus
mattson
right.
mr.
marcus
mattson
yes,
very
much
so.
mr.
marcus
mattson
i
don't
think
this
is
the
first
case.
mr.
marcus
mattson
there
aren't
any
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
statute
is
so
explicit.
mr.
marcus
mattson
yes.
mr.
marcus
mattson
they're
purchased
all
in
california.
mr.
marcus
mattson
well,
or
a
distributor
or
whatever
you
might
call
him.
mr.
marcus
mattson
yes,
they
buy
it
part
from
out
of
state.
the
affidavits
talk
about
a
portion
going
from
out
of
state,
the
closes
they
got
was
an
estimate
of
one
man
who
said
that
40%
came
from
out
of
state.
mr.
marcus
mattson
yes.
the
distributor's
purchases
were
40%
of
out
of
state.
mr.
marcus
mattson
the
record
doesn't
show
any
figures
that
you
can
point
to
with
that
regard.
portions
where
the
--
for
instance
the
--
what
anybody
who
isn't
--
the
janitorial
business
purchase
a
lot
of
paper
goods.
paper
--
we
don't
have
paper
for
us
in
california
so
you
got
the
raw
--
the
paper
comes
from
out
of
state.
it
came
to
--
in
some
cases
it
was
reprocessed
in
california
but
it
came
to
a
wholesaler
and
we
bought
the
--
or
the
benton
bought
the
paper
from
the
wholesaler.
mr.
marcus
mattson
oh
yes.
mr.
marcus
mattson
yes.
mr.
marcus
mattson
i
really
don't
know.
the
founder
of
my
client
was
a
window
washer.
the
father
of
the
two
men
who
operate
the
american
building
maintenance
was
a
window
washer
in
san
francisco
in
the
bank
of
america
building
and
he
started
this
business
from
there
and
it
has
expanded.
the
legislative
history
is
particularly
significant
when
you
come
to
the
1950
amendments.
and
mind
you,
in
1950,
the
clayton
act
7
was
extensively
reviewed
and
you
can
find
that
in
brown
shoe.
they
spell
out
to
the
extent
to
which
that
length,
the
federal
trade
commission
from
starting
in
1928
proposed
changes
in
section
7.
so
i
say
that
section
7
as
reenacted
in
1950
was
just
like
a
reenactment
of
that
statute.
and
they
--
and
our
brief
will
show
you
there
were
--
in
the
7
years
prior
to
1956,
bills
were
introduced
in
which
mentioned
affecting
interstate
--
affecting
commerce.
in
other
words,
would
have
change
the
words
engaged
in
commerce
to
affecting
commerce.
now,
those
were
--
as
a
part
of
section
7
in
a
pre-merger
notification
proposal
that
was
made.
and
the
significant,
highly
significant
is
that
in
1958,
there
was
a
bill
entered
or
two
bills
introduced
which
would
have
said
--
which
was
provided
that
if
either
corporation,
either
acquired
or
the
acquiring
corporation
was
engaged
in
commerce,
the
action
could
proceed.
and
senator
sparkman
was
in
the
hearings.
he
was
the
proposer
of
one
of
those
two
bills
and
he
explained
that
his
bill
made
section
applicable
if
either
company
was
engaged
in
interstate
commerce.
and
he
explained
that
the
existing
situation
was
that
in
cases
where
the
acquired
corporation
is
engaged
exclusively
in
intrastate
commerce,
the
enforcement
agencies
lack
jurisdiction.
and
paul
rand
dixon
spoke
up
at
that
hearing
and
he
said,
the
in
commerce
test
is
quite
different
from
the
affecting
commerce
as
you
recognized.
and
as
late
as
january
of
this
year,
congress
changed
the
federal
trade
commission
act
section
5.
so
that
it
now
reads
in
or
affecting
commerce.
but
congress
didn't
at
that
time
embraced
the
opportunity
to
change
section
7.
the
--
and
the
1950
amendments
of
course
came
subsequent
to
this
court's
decision
in
federal
trade
commission
versus
bunte
in
which
the
court
said
this
case
presents
the
narrow
question
of
what
congress
did,
not
quite
it
could
do.
in
other
words,
that's
the
question
here.
and
we
merely
hold
that
to
read
unfair
methods
of
competition
in
interstate
commerce
as
though
it
meant
unfair
methods
of
competition
in
any
way
affecting
interstate
commerce
requires
in
view
of
the
relevant
considerations
much
clear
manifestations
of
the
intention
of
congress
than
it
furnished.
mr.
marcus
mattson
oh
yes.
this
is
the
labor
oriented
business.
mr.
marcus
mattson
right,
very
small,
it's
3%
as
i
recall.
i
believe
--
mr.
marcus
mattson
--
its
total
gross
income
is
in
the
--
the
government's
position
with
reference
to
the
legislative
history
is
ambivalent.
it
relies
upon
post
1914
history
itself
on
page
--
on
the
number
of
pages
but
would
apparently
foreclose
us
from
doing
that.
mr.
marcus
mattson
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
marcus
mattson
the
commerce
part
of
section
7
is
the
first
part,
they
engaged
in
commerce.
mr.
marcus
mattson
the
operative
part.
mr.
marcus
mattson
exactly.
mr.
marcus
mattson
and
this
case
is
brought
upon
that
theory.
they
allege
only
that
the
effect
is
in
southern
california.
mr.
marcus
mattson
but
you
have
to
get
in
to
--
the
only
way
to
get
in
to
court
perhaps
is
by
means
of
the
jurisdictional
point.
mr.
marcus
mattson
yes.
mr.
marcus
mattson
right.
mr.
marcus
mattson
right
correct,
and
as
it
could
be
here.
mr.
marcus
mattson
yes.
mr.
marcus
mattson
it
is
alleged
only
in
southern
california.
the
--
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
foreclose
us
from
using
1950
legislative
history,
which
they
apparently
would
like
to
avoid
besides
philadelphia
national
bank,
the
court
--
there
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
assertion
that
after
the
1950
amendment
to
section
7,
some
members
of
congress
and
for
a
time
the
justice
department,
this
is
quoting
from
the
opinion.
some
members
of
congress
and
for
a
time
the
justice
department
forced
the
view
that
bank
mergers
were
still
beyond
the
reach
of
the
section
as
to
which
this
court
said,
the
views
of
a
subsequent
congress
form
a
hazardous
basis
for
the
intent
of
the
early
one.
now,
that
may
have
been
perfectly
valid
there
but
here,
we're
not
presenting
post
1914
legislative
history
for
the
purpose
of
inferring
anything
into
the
statute.
we
are
using
the
legislative
history
to
confirm
the
explicit
terms
of
the
1914
statute
and
for
the
purpose
of
showing
that
congress
when
it
reenacted
clayton
act
in
1950
had
an
intent
consistent
with
the
explicit
terms
of
the
statute
and
inconsistent
with
the
new
application
of
the
statute
which
the
government
is
now
asserting.
in
philadelphia
bank,
the
defendant
was
attempting
to
avoid
the
language
of
section
7
and
to
use
for
that
purpose
matters
outside
of
section
7
like
the
bank
merger
act
of
1960.
the
government
here
is
trying
to
do
the
same
thing,
they're
trying
to
avoid
the
explicit
language
of
the
statute.
we
on
the
other
hand
are
supporting
it.
now,
i
perhaps
should
refer
to
the
standard
oil
case
because
that's
been
referred
to
by
counsel
and
i
think
it
confirmed
some
of
the
things
that
i
--
we've
said
in
our
briefs
and
perhaps
i
didn't
treat
it
fully
there.
the
standard
oil
company
of
california
case
confirms
our
position.
the
court
there
was
dealing
not
with
the
narrowly
directed
jurisdictional
question
of
section
3
as
we
are
here
with
section
7.
standard
oil
company
was
obviously
engaged
in
commerce
with
any
question
about
it.
and
under
section
3,
it
was
necessary
that
only
one
of
the
corporation
making
the
contract
be
engaged
in
commerce.
standard
oil
company
was
the
question
which
this
court
faced
and
determined
in
the
standard
oil
case
was
whether
the
requirements
contracts
lessened
competition
under
the
broadly
phrase
portion
of
the
statute.
the
--
since
the
contracts
prevented
service
station
operators
from
dealing
with
suppliers
from
outside
of
california
as
well
as
within
the
state
and
because
the
large
number
of
such
contracts,
competition
was
lessened
in
both
intrastate
and
interstate.
but
again,
that
was
the
operative
portion,
not
the
jurisdictional
portion
of
the
statute.
there
was
no
issue
as
to
whether
standard
was
engaged
in
commerce
and
the
operative
portion
of
section
3
was
satisfied
by
extensive
evidence
on
the
structure
of
the
industry.
and
the
substantiality
of
the
number
of
requirements
contracts,
and
i
think
that
case
will
demonstrate
to
the
court
that
there
has
been
no
satisfying
the
requirements
of
the
government's
own
proposal
with
regard
to
section
7
and
they
say
it
should
read
that
local
activities
which
have
a
substantial
effect
on
interstate
commerce
but
they
have
proved
no
such
effect.
all
they
have
shown
is
that
we
receive
money.
they
said
80%
to
90%
of
our
revenues
form
interstate
operators.
that
shows
only
in
effect
on
benton
not
in
interstate
commerce.
and
they
have
shown
nothing
with
regard
to
the
structure
of
any
product
which
we
bought.
they
merely
show
that
we
bought
--
i
think
it's
a
$150,000.00
worth
according
to
the
briefs,
i
can't
find
where
they
got
that
figure
in
the
record
but
be
that
as
it
may,
they've
shown
no
market
structure
of
any
kind
with
regard
to
any
market
of
goods
that
passed
in
to
interstate
commerce
before
we
bought
them.
thank
you.
