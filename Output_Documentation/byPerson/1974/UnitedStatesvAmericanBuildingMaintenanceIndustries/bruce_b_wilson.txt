mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
interested
in
listening
to
the
prior
argument
because
we
were
dealing
with
matters
of
economic
reality,
serious
matters
and
matters
which
concerned
individuals.
i
think
this
case
is
a
little
different
and
it
involves
matters
of
economic
reality
which
concern
the
national
economy.
this
case
is
here
today
because
in
1950,
the
congress
was
concerned
with
increasing
concentration
in
that
national
economy
and
it
was
concerned
with
increasing
concentration
which
was
resulting
from
mergers
and
acquisitions.
and
it
was
concerned
with
acquisitions
by
national
companies
of
local
firms
and
that
kind
of
acquisition
which
was
attributing
--
contributing
to
that
increasing
concentration.
now,
this
case
squarely
presents
the
question
of
whether
congress
effectively
executed
its
expressed
intention
to
prevent
that
kind
of
mergers
and
acquisitions.
there's
really
only
one
issue
or
decision
in
this
case,
whether
congress
in
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
intended
to
exercise
the
full
scope
of
its
power
to
reach
mergers
and
acquisitions
not
only
in
commerce,
in
the
flow
of
commerce
but
also
those
which
affected
commerce.
now,
if
congress
didn't
so
intend
and
if
congress
did
not
so
effectively
legislate
then
a
series
of
acquisitions
could
occur,
acquisitions
of
intrastate
firms
which
could
result
in
a
situation
which
congress
clearly
sought
to
avoid.
it
sought
to
avoid
that
situation
in
a
statute
which
it
denominated
as
a
supplement
to
the
sherman
act.
and
as
we
shall
see,
congress
in
the
sherman
act
intended
to
exercise
the
full
range
of
its
power.
and
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows.
in
1971,
the
united
states
filed
this
civil
action
under
section
7
challenging
a
transaction
in
which
the
american
building
maintenance
industries
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
right.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
fine,
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
just
before
the
luncheon
recess,
we
had
outlined
the
central
issue
in
this
civil
antitrust
case
which
was
filed
by
the
government
in
1971.
in
this
case,
the
government
challenged
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
a
transaction
in
which
affirmed
american
building
maintenance
industries
acquired
control
of
two
janitorial
service
firms
doing
business
in
southern
california.
one
was
the
benton
maintenance
company,
the
other
was
the
j.e.
benton
management
corporation.
in
terms
of
market
shares
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition,
american
controlled
about
10%
of
the
janitorial
service
market
in
southern
california
and
the
benton
companies
combined
had
about
7%.
now,
of
course,
the
statute
with
which
we
deal
here
today,
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
prohibits
the
acquisition
by
any
corporation
engaged
in
commerce
of
the
stock
or
assets
of
another
corporation,
engaged
also
in
commerce
where
the
effect
of
that
acquisition
maybe
to
substantially
lessen
competition
or
tend
to
create
a
monopoly.
and
this
case
involves
the
meaning
of
four
words
in
that
statute.
those
four
words
being
a
corporation,
also
engaged
in
commerce.
there's
no
question
as
to
whether
the
acquiring
firm,
american
was
engaged
in
commerce.
no
such
question
has
been
raised.
but
the
decision
on
the
district
court
was
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
on
the
grounds
that
the
acquired
firms
were
not
corporations
engaged
also
in
commerce.
the
government
introduced
various
affidavits,
none
of
which
i
think
are
disputed
showing
that
benton
had
provided
janitorial
services
necessary
to
support
the
interstate
operation
of
its
customers.
the
benton
had
purchased
substantial
quantities
of
janitorial
supplies
manufactured
outside
of
california.
that
it
negotiated
at
least
to
major
contracts
without
a
state
customer
and
that
it
did
although
to
--
admittedly
minor
extent
utilized
interstate
communications
facilities
in
its
business.
the
court
below
entered
summary
judgment
in
1973
and
in
doing
so,
it
adopted
almost
rebut
him
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
submitted
by
america
but
proposed
prior
to
the
time
that
the
united
states
had
filed
its
affidavits.
of
course,
once
the
court
had
concluded
that,
it
resulted
in
a
holding
that
section
7
had
no
application
to
this
case.
but
there
was
however
in
the
court
below,
no
opinion
explaining
the
court's
reasoning
as
to
how
it
reached
its
conclusion.
the
first
issue
which
this
appeal
raises
and
when
which
is
easily
disposed
off,
is
whether
the
power
of
congress
could
reach
this
kind
of
a
transaction.
this
court
disposed
of
that
question
in
mandeville
island
farms
against
american
crystal
sugar
in
1947.
there,
the
question
was
whether
an
agreement
by
sugar
refiners
which
sold
sugar
in
interstate
commerce
could
agree
on
the
price.
whether
they
could
agree
on
the
price
which
they
were
going
to
pay
to
sugar
beet
growers
located
in
northern
california.
this
court
in
that
case
clearly
held
that
such
an
agreement
on
price
was
an
agreement
which
affected
commerce
and
one
that
was
in
--
within
the
reach
of
the
sherman
act,
the
first
antitrust
statute.
now,
of
course,
when
we're
dealing
with
the
sherman
act
and
with
the
clayton
act,
we
are
not
dealing
with
the
same
statutes.
but
we
are
dealing
with
statutes
in
which
congress
sought
to
address
substantially
the
same
problem,
the
problem
of
monopoly,
the
problem
of
trust,
the
problem
of
anticompetitive
effects
on
the
american
economy.
when
congress
passed
the
clayton
act
in
1914,
it
made
clear
that
that
act
was
intended
to
supplement
the
sherman
act
which
congress
had
enacted
in
1890.
in
the
light
therefore
of
mandeville
farms,
the
holding
of
this
court
in
that
case,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
much
question
but
that
congress
if
it
so
desired
and
intended
could
have
made
the
scope
of
the
clayton
act
equally
as
broad.
it
could
have
reached
a
merger
or
acquisition
of
the
type
with
which
we
deal
here.
and
this
brings
us
i
think
down
to
the
central
issue,
did
congress
intend
in
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
to
exercise
as
it
did
in
the
sherman
act
the
full
extend
of
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause?
i
think
if
one
looks
at
the
history
of
the
antitrust
laws,
one
can
conclude
only
that
congress
in
enacting
section
7
did
intend
to
exercise
the
full
extent
of
those
powers.
in
the
sherman
act,
we
have
not
only
mandeville
farms,
we
have
south-eastern
underwriters
in
1944
again
holding
that
in
that
act,
congress
wanted
to
go
to
the
full
extent
of
its
constitutional
power
in
restraining
trust
agreements
and
in
restraining
monopoly
agreements.
and
thus,
given
the
history
of
that
act,
senator
george
in
1890
stating
that
sherman
was
ingeniously
drawn
to
cover
every
case
that
is
within
the
commercial
power
of
congress
and
senator
sherman
after
whom
the
act
was
of
course
named
noting
that
the
bill
was
just
as
broad
and
as
sweeping
and
as
explicit
as
the
english
language
couldn't
make
it
become
then
to
1914
and
we
see
that
congress
in
1914
dissatisfied
and
disappointed
with
the
application
of
the
1890
law.
we
find
that
congress
disappointed
and
dissatisfied
with
its
efforts
to
control
trust
and
monopolies.
and
so
in
1914,
we
find
the
congress
enacting
a
law,
which
according
to
its
title
was
to
supplement
the
existing
laws
against
restraints
and
monopolies.
the
congress
in
that
act
wanted
to
arrest
such
restraints
in
their
incipiency
and
they
intended
to
do
that
insofar
as
it
was
possible
to
do
so
and
they
did
it
in
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
i
think
so
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
we
have
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
bennington
bank
where
the
question
was
as
to
the
jurisdictional
--
not
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
act
but
rather
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
no
but
it's
a
merger
of
the
same
type
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
--
and
that
i
think
is
very
important
because
a
question
here
is,
does
the
jurisdiction
of
the
act
extend
to
this
kind
of
a
merger?
the
act
--
the
question
in
bennington
was
whether
bennington
vermont
was
indeed
a
section
of
the
country.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
well,
i
think
the
problems
with
which
we
are
dealing
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
i
think
in
recent
years,
yes
sir
it
has.
but
not
consistently
since
1914,
i
think
the
appellee
is
correct
on
that.
then
until
we
get
to
such
cases
as
bennington,
until
we
get
to
problems
within
let
us
say
the
last
10
years,
the
department
indeed
has
not
challenged
that
kind
of
a
merger.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
mr.
justice
powell,
i
agree
that
this
is
the
first
case
in
this
court
which
clearly
presents
the
question
of
whether
the
acquisition
by
an
interstate
firm.
by
the
--
no
question
on
the
acquiring
corporation
of
an
acquired
firm
dealing
primarily
in
intrastate
commerce
but
with
the
interstate
contacts
that
we
have
here
serving
interstate
firms,
buying
supplies
from
out
of
state.
i
think
this
is
the
first
case
which
presents
this
kind
of
a
set
of
facts.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
i
think
the
congress
mr.
justice
powell
has
indicated
that
it
wants
us
to
bring
this
kind
of
a
suit
where
the
result
of
the
acquisition
is
going
to
be
in
the
words
of
the
statute
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
and
it
is
indicated
that
time
and
time
again,
it
did
again
in
1950
when
it
amended
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
oh,
i
don't
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
think
it
has.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
there
have
been
proposals
but
one
cannot
rely
as
this
court
has
recognized
on
the
failure
of
congress
to
act
on
a
specific
proposal
as
an
indication
of
congress'
intent
in
enacting
a
statute
which
has
already
enacted
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
oh,
heavens,
no,
one
has
to
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
well,
there
is
the
evidence
of
congress
and
it's
--
the
statements
of
its
intention
in
1950,
again,
it
came
back
to
the
clayton
act
in
1950.
and
in
a
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
read,
engaged
and/or
affect
in
commerce.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
or
indeed
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
yes
sir.
coming
back
to
1950,
congress
then
made
the
act
applicable
to
asset
--
acquisitions
of
assets
as
well
as
the
stock
of
competing
corporations.
and
the
house
report
indicated
that
the
1950
amendments
made
the
act
less
restrictive
prohibiting
mergers
and
acquisitions
where
in
any
line
of
commerce
in
any
section
of
the
country,
the
effect
of
that
acquisition
might
maybe
to
substantially
lessen
competition.
and
the
report
made
it
clear
that
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
was
go
even
further
if
they
could
than
they
went
in
the
sherman
act.
one
can't
conclude
looking
at
that
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
that
the
reach
of
the
clayton
act
should
be
less
than
the
reach
of
the
sherman
act
but
there
was
a
concern
raised
in
congress
at
that
time.
that
the
act
might
be
construed
to
prohibit
the
acquisition
of
a
local
business
by
another
local
business
in
the
same
town.
these
concerns
are
addressed
in
the
legislative
history
and
rather
than
narrowing
the
reach
of
the
jurisdiction
under
the
commerce
requirement
that
congress
limited
the
terms
of
the
substantive
offense.
the
original
draft
provided
that
the
act
would
be
violated,
if
competition
was
substantially
lessened
in
any
community
and
that
language
concerned
the
senate
and
the
senate
noted
that
that
language
was
dropped
and
the
phrase
"in
any
section
of
the
country"
was
substituted
in
order
to
get
rid
of
that
concern.
but
even
so,
the
senate
also
concurred
in
the
view
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
this
legislation
to
assure
a
broader
construction
of
the
more
fundamental
provisions
that
are
retained
than
has
been
given
in
the
past.
then
we
come
and
now
retrogressing
a
little
bit
to
the
questions
of
the
1936
amendments
which
inserted
in
the
clayton
act
provisions
governing
price
discrimination.
but
those
provisions
and
the
merger
provisions
of
section
7
have
very
different
jurisdictional
test.
and
the
jurisdictional
tests
under
the
price
discrimination
provisions
were
those
construed
by
this
court
in
gulf
oil
corporation
against
copp
paving
company
decided
earlier
this
term.
the
court
there
expressly
declined
to
decide
the
decision
and
to
decide
the
question
which
we
are
dealing
here
with
today.
if
one
examines
those
jurisdictional
provisions,
the
differences
are
immediately
apparent.
to
violate
the
price
discrimination
provisions,
one
must
be
engaged
in
commerce.
yes,
the
same
language
which
we
have
under
the
merger
provisions.
one
must
also
make
a
sale
in
the
course
of
such
commerce
and
finally,
either
or
any
of
the
purchasers
involved
in
the
price
discrimination
must
be
in
commerce.
so,
we
have
there
a
three
part
test
for
jurisdictional
purposes,
not
the
single
test
which
is
involved
in
section
7.
second,
i
think
we
have
to
note
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
congressional
enactments
dealing
with
commerce
reveal
a
process
of
legislation
which
is
words
of
i
believe
mr.
justice
frankfurter
strikingly
empiric.
the
court
has
uniformly
looked
to
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
enacting
particular
statutes.
again,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
if
we
do
--
if
we
do
not
do
that
to
search
for
a
dependable
touch
zone
is
as
rewarding
as
an
attempt
to
square
the
circle.
so,
we
have
to
look
to
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
this
statute
in
1914,
in
amending
it
again
in
1950
and
the
construction
which
this
court
has
since
placed
on
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
court
in
von's
grocery
noted
that
the
1950
amendments
were
designed
to
broaden
the
scope
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
that's
right,
it
did
not
mr.
justice
stewart
in
any
way
change
what
the
jurisdictional
requirements
had
been
in
1914.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
well,
i
think
it
is
more
limiting
in
the
sense
that
it
limits
the
substantive
offense
under
the
clayton
act
that
there
is
no
indication
in
any
of
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
clayton
act
to
be
less
than
the
jurisdiction
which
congress
had
exercised
under
the
sherman
act.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
simply
by
it
terms.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
well,
i
don't
think
the
substantive
offense
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
--
is
so
defined.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
now,
if
congress
jurisdiction
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
if
congress
jurisdictionally
wanted
to
reach
that,
there's
no
doubt
that
they
could
and
the
question
is
did
they
intend
to
reach
this
kind
of
a
merger.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
and
our
answer
to
that
is
yes.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
they
did.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
that
is
correct.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
now,
coming
back
just
for
a
moment
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
as
to
what
kind
of
acquisitions
was
section
7
designed
to
reach.
well,
we
have
in
von's
grocery,
a
curious
parallel.
and
i
think
to
this
case,
we've
already
discussed
the
bennington
bank
case,
the
whole
issue
in
that
case,
everything
else
was
conceded
was
whether
the
bennington
area
of
vermont
was
a
section
of
the
country
for
the
purposes
of
section
7,
that's
how
the
congress
limited
the
reach
of
the
statute
in
addition
to
limiting
its
reach
to
corporations
rather
than
natural
persons.
then
i
think
von's
grocery
is
a
good
example
of
something
which
is
a
purely
local
merger.
there
were
two
grocery
companies.
they
had
seven-and-a-half
percent
of
the
los
angeles
market.
and
by
coincidence
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with
precisely
the
same
market
with
which
the
court
dealt
in
that
case.
and
this
court
noted
that
in
that
case
congress
had
passed
the
1950
amendments
to
prevent
a
destruction
of
competition.
it
noted
that
the
cases
since
the
passage
of
that
act
have
faithfully
endeavored
to
enforce
that
congressional
command
and
the
united
states
believes
that
the
court
should
today
continue
to
enforce
that
congressional
command.
let
me
sum
up,
in
our
view
the
scope
of
the
clayton
act
is
coterminous
with
that
of
the
sherman
act,
the
act
which
it
was
designed
to
supplement.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
could
remain
--
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
i
would
appreciate
it.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
mr.
chief
justice,
i
arise
to
make
but
one
short
point.
it
seems
that
page
36
of
our
brief
is
becoming
fairly
notorious
and
i
would
only
wish
to
point
out
that
our
enforcement
policy
can
in
no
way
stop
what
the
congress
tried
to
do
in
a
statute.
even
if
it's
a
new
policy,
even
if
this
is
the
first
case
brought
and
we
do
not
believe
it
is.
maybe
the
first
case
we
have
brought
but
certainly
the
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
they
were
engaged
in
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
that
--
of
those
words
for
the
jurisdictional
purposes
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
no,
i
think
we
have
to
say
that
the
affecting
commerce
in
any
section
of
the
--
in
any
line
of
commerce
in
any
section
of
the
country,
that's
what
gets
this
merger
within
the
scope
of
the
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
well,
they
were,
there
were
certainly
dealings
in
interstate
that
gives
directly
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
well,
the
district
court
of
course
found
that
those
dealings
were
de
minimis.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
if
--
we
don't
agree
with
that
but
if
one
accepts
the
district
court's
findings,
we
say
that
nevertheless
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
oh
no
sir.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
no
sir.
and
there
is
one
case
--
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
there
is
one
case
which
is
directly
on
point.
the
third
circuit
decision
in
transamerica
by
--
decided
by
a
panel
of
judges,
maris,
goodrich
and
kalodner
which
deals
directly
with
the
point
at
issue
here,
did
congress
intend
in
this
statute
to
exercise
the
same
full
range
of
its
jurisdictional
power
which
it
exercised
in
the
sherman
act.
the
court
there
so
held
that
is
coming
back
to
that
last
point.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
yes
sir.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
well,
i
think
one
has
to
come
back
to
the
--
a
position
taken
by
an
administrative
agency
cannot
be
used
subsequently
to
stop
the
intent
of
congress
in
passing
a
statute.
if
the
statute
means
what
we
contended
means,
the
fact
that
we
have
been
mistaken,
the
fact
that
a
--
another
committee
have
been
mistaken
and
the
fact
that
the
federal
trade
commission
may
have
been
mistaken
in
some
of
the
positions,
it
is
taken
in
the
past
should
not
prohibit
a
new
construction,
not
really
a
new
construction,
a
real
construction,
a
true
construction
of
the
statute
and
its
meaning.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
well,
i
think
one
has
to
look
at
the
growth
of
the
service
industries
generally.
i
don't
think
as
in
the
antitrust
business
as
we
deal
with
it
everyday.
one
can
precisely
put
a
time.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
yes
sir,
10
to
15
years.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
bruce
b.
wilson
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you.
