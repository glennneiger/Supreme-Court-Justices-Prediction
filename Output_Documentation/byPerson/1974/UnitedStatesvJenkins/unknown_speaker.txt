unknown
speaker
and
this
case
is
not
as
the
case
in
which
the
respondent
jenkins
did
have
a
counselor
that
he
consulted?
unknown
speaker
was
that
man
a
lawyer
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
he
presumably
had
some
expertise
with
respect
to
the
law
of
selective
service?
unknown
speaker
also,
would
have
been
a
very
good
counselor?
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
presumably
would
have
know
the
law
of
second
circuit,
right?
was
that
not
part
of
some
of
the
briefing?
unknown
speaker
well
if
you
go
to
it,
if
the
person
is
a
doctor,
for
example,
you
assume
the
doctor
knows
something
about
medicine
just
by
definition,
if
you
got
to
a
counselor,
a
draft
selected
service
counselor,
you
assume
almost
by
definition
if
he
is
a
counselor
unless
he
is
a
fraud
and
he
knows
something
about
selective
service
law,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
need
to
be
on
the
record.
unknown
speaker
is
fong
foo
pretty
much
in
point?
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
legally
erroneous
acquittal,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
did
the
state
have
a
double
jeopardy
--
a
guarantee
against
double
jeopardy
in
this
conduction
that
you
know?
unknown
speaker
constitutionally?
unknown
speaker
your
appeal
is
successful
if
it
had
been
--
your
appeal
is
successful
if
it
had
been
attained
by
the
court
of
appeals,
would
have
result
in
what?
unknown
speaker
have
you
--
i
am
just
thinking
--
a
lot
of
if
i
have
ever
seen
on
the
reviewing
court
opinion
the
direction
to
enter
a
judgment
of
conviction
simplict--
plain
over
without
any
further
proceedings.
unknown
speaker
guilty.
unknown
speaker
they
can
get
that,
if
not
a
trial.
unknown
speaker
that
is
all,
just
without
the
defendant
even
there
in
the
court
room?
unknown
speaker
now
would
you
say
--
unknown
speaker
does
his
conditions
comply
that
judge
friendly's
view
that
there
expressed
is
that
the
judge
at
a
bench
trial
can
not
for
any
or
no
reason
direct
an
acquittal
as
jury
could?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
judge
travia
did
what
my
brother
rehnquist
suggests
that
the
government
could
appeal
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
this
is
on
the
review
that
you
suggested
would
happen
in
this
case
if
you
prevail.
it
goes
back
to
judge
travia.
i
guess
he
is
no
longer
on
the
bench,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
went
back
to
judge
travia
and
he
were
now
to
say
as
my
brother
rehnquist
said,
“well,
on
second
thought
i
might
obtain
this
--
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
he
did
say,
“i
entertained
a
reasonable
doubt.
he
said
nothing
except,
“i
direct
the
verdict”
or,
“i
find
the
defendant
not
guilty.”
unknown
speaker
that
is
all
he
says.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
right
up
against
fong
foo
if
you
did
so,
would
you
not?
unknown
speaker
it
was
wholly
--
it
was
grandiosely
erroneous
judgment
of
acquittal
midway
in
a
trail
and
the
--
your
client,
the
united
states
somehow
besought
mandamus
in
that
and
that
got
it
from
the
fist
circuit
court
of
appeals.
this
court
reversed
had
said,
“no
matter
how
erroneous,
no
matter
how
grandiosely
erroneous
that
action
of
the
district
judge
that
bring
a
judgement
of
an
acquittal
was
an
acquittal
and
any
further
proceedings
would
be
double
jeopardy.”
unknown
speaker
and
mr.
mahan
was
the
clerk
of
the
selective
service
board?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
mr,
carroll,
did
you
submit
the
post
findings
and
conclusions?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
at
page
4
of
52
(a)
of
judge
travia's
first
sentence
the
indictment
of
this
case
is
dismissed,
so
the
defendant
is
discharged?
is
that
your
submission?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
judgment
of
acquittal
–
judgment
of
acquittal
in
(inaudible)
what
was
it
you
asked?
unknown
speaker
judgement
of
acquittal.
i
see.
unknown
speaker
then
bringing
it
to
our
attention,
what
are
you
suggesting
now,
mr.
carroll?
unknown
speaker
you
went
through
the
entire
routine
--
?
unknown
speaker
right
up
in
through
the
filling
of
briefs
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
carroll,
if
the
government
should
prevail
here
and
the
case
went
back,
do
you
think
judge
travia
assuming
he
would
hear
it
could
sit
on
the
findings
of
fact
that
were
made
or
would
he
have
to
make
new
ones
or
additional
ones,
what
is
your
evaluation
of
that?
unknown
speaker
well
i
take
that
you
are
saying
that
if
the
government
should
prevail,
the
case
is
remanded,
there
is
no
way
to
avoid
a
new
trial?
unknown
speaker
maybe
the
other
side
would
want
one?
