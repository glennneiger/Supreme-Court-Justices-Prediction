what
if
judge
travia
had
determined
on
a
somewhat
different
factual
situation
a
bench
trial
that
the
statute
limitations
barred
this
prosecution
and
made
all
the
findings
that
indicated
otherwise
he
would
certainly
the
man
guilty.
but
he
said,
“on
the
base
of
the
statute
limitations,
i
am
going
to
enter
a
judgement
of
acquittal.”
do
you
say
the
government
can
appeal
that
determination
without
violating
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
distinguish
between
an
identical
ruling
on
the
statute
limitations
at
the
close
of
all
the
evidence
and
wanted
the
close
of
the
governments
case.
a
retrial
would
be
required
if
you
reverse
the
judgment
that
was
entered
that
close
the
government's
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
the
judge
would
just
pick
up
hearing
the
evidence
from
the
defendant
two
years
later?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
here
you
do
not
have
any
verdict
to
reinstate
that
that
is
one
of
your
problems
is
it
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
supposing
the
court
of
appeals
had
decided
it

jurisdiction
in
this
case.
say
judge
travia
was
wrong
on
the
legal
point,
reverse
the
order
dismissing
the
indictment
and
remanded
for
further
proceeding.
judge
travia
then
again
address
himself
to
the
question
of
what
judgment
should
be
entered
sine
the
previous
judgment

vacated.
he
says,
“on
second
thought,
i
have
got
reasonable
doubt
about
this.
i
am

if

the

this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
involves
a
construction
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
constitution.
respondent
jenkins
was
indicted
for
refusing
to
report
for
induction.
he
waived
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
was
--
had
a
bench
trial
and
after
the
trial,
a
district
judge
dismissed
the
indictment
and
discharged
the
respondent.
the
court
ruled
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
convict
him
since
at
the
time
he
refused
induction
it
appeared
that
under
a
second
circuit
precedent
that
the
induction
order
was
unlawful.
the
government
appealed
this
judgment
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
contending
that
the
district
court
should
have
found
respondent
guilty
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
meantime
had
repudiated
the
second
circuit
precedent.
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
appeal
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
therefore
not
authorized
by
the
applicable
statute.
the
applying
principles
announced
today
in
united
states
versus
wilson,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
cannot
find
in
the
district
court's
opinion
a
clear
indication
that
it
found
against
the
respondent
the
facts
necessary
to
convict
even
under
the
government's
legal
theory
of
the
case.
unlike
wilson,
there
is
no
guilty
verdict
or
finding
of
guilt
which
could
simply
be
reinstated
in
the
event
an
appellate
court
reversed
on
a
legal
error.
since
additional
proceedings
devoted
to
resolution
of
factual
issues
going
to
the
elements
of
the
offense
charged
would
be
required
upon
reversal
and
remand
to
subject
respondent
any
further
proceedings
would
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
accordingly
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit.
