justice
potter
stewart
under
your
submission,
it
seems
to
me
its
quite
material
because
you
say
this
would
be
a
different
case
if
you
are
successful
in
the
court
of
appeals,
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
change
your
appeal.
and
if
you
succeeded
on
the
merits
of
the
appeal,
you
can
see
that
there
would
be
double
jeopardy
if
the
remand
after
your
successful
argument
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
your
argument,
it
would
be
for
a
trial,
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
thought
i
think
what
happens
after
remand
is
rather
important
your
argument
as
i
understand
it.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
priority
of
your
brief
in
the
court
of
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
court
of
appeal
direct
a
judgment
of
guilty?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
be
unprecedented,
would
you?
justice
potter
stewart
the
motion
that
appears
on
the
page
that
starts
on
page
four
of
the
appendix
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
motion
of
judgment
of
acquittal
singed
by
you.
