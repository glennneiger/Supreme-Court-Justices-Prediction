mr.
fryer,
i
still
think
you
are
asking
the
court
of
appeals
to
direct
a
verdict
of
guilty.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
get
away
from
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
saying
you
could
direct
the
verdict
of
guilty?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
answer
me,
are
you
not
doing
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
of
appeals
should
say,
“you
were
wrong
in
acquitting
the
man.
you
should
have
found
him
guilty.
therefore,
proceed
pursuant
to
this
opinion.”
that
is
like
the
old
british
case,
you
found
the
man
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
and
you
watch
to
consider
your
verdict.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
really
mean
certiorari,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
appeal,
you
mean
certiorari?
