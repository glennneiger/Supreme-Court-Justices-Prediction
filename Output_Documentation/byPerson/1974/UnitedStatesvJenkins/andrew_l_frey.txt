mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
grant
of
the
petition
of
the
united
states
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
a
review
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
which
dismiss
the
government's
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
which
in
turn
the
dismiss
respondent
jenkins
indictment
for
knowing
failure
to
submit
to
induction
into
the
arm
services.
this
case
is
related
to
the
next
case
which
you
will
hear,
united
states
against
wilson.
both
involved
the
issue
of
whether
the
united
states
may
appeal
constitutionally
consistently
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause
from
a
post
trial
ruling
which
would
be
denominated
on
acquittal
under
the
definition
in
jenkins.
the
wilson
case
also
involves
the
further
issue
of
whether
the
ruling
there
was
an
acquittal
for
purposes
of
such
a
rule
if
the
court
were
to
adopt
such
a
rule.
now
the
pertinent
facts
surrounding
jenkins
offense
as
disclosed
by
the
evidence
at
trial
and
has
specifically
found
by
the
district
court
are
undisputed.
mr.
jenkins
was
ordered
on
february
4th,
1971
to
report
for
induction
on
february
24th.
the
validity
of
that
order
as
initially
issued
is
on
challenge.
mr.
jenkins
received
that
order,
he
wrote
the
local
board
thereafter
requesting
a
form
on
which
to
apply
for
contentious
subject
to
classification.
on
the
day
before
his
induction,
he
went
down
to
this
local
board,
again
to
pick
up
this
form.
at
that
time,
he
gave
them
a
brief
written
statement
of
his
contentious
subjection
claim.
at
that
time,
eh
was
told
that
his
induction
order
would
not
be
postpones
and
that
he
should
report
the
following
day.
on
february
24th,
1971,
he
failed
to
report
for
induction.
these
findings
were
all
specifically
made
by
the
district
court.
now
it
is
the
government's
position
that
these
facts
required
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
entry
of
a
judgment
of
conviction
against
respondent
jenkins.
however,
the
district
court
concluded
that
because
these
offense
took
place
prior
to
this
court's
decision
in
ehlert
and
because
that
the
time
of
these
events
in
the
view
of
the
district
court,
it
was
the
law
of
the
second
circuit
that
the
local
board
was
required
to
postpone
respondent
jenkins
induction
and
to
consider
his
claim
of
like
crystallizing
conscientious
objection.
it
would
be
unfair
to
apply
the
ehlert
principle
to
the
defendant
who
was
before
the
district
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
did.
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
draft
counselor
i
believe
was
not
a
lawyer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do
not
know,
it
is
not
in
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
is
not
in
the
record
presumably.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
that
is
–
but
surely
is
speculative.
i
do
not
–
that
was
not
a
part
of
judge
travia's
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
do
not
know
whether
this
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
it,
but
i
think
that
what
the
district
court
held
was
that
with
respect
to
people,
who
at
that
time
were
ordered
to
report
for
induction
when
the
law
of
the
second
circuit
has
been
held
in
the
gearey
case,
it
would
be
unfair
to
apply
ehlert
retroactively.
now
that
is
a
question
of
law
and
that
is
a
question
of
law
which
was
decided
in
favor
of
the
government
in
the
case
called
mercado,
which
was
then
pending
on
appeal
in
the
second
circuit.
because
of
the
conflict
between
the
two
cases,
the
solicitor
general
authorized
an
appeal
in
the
jenkins
case.
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
mercado,
clearly
establishes,
the
district
court
here
was
in
error
in
dismissing
the
indictment
and
the
respondent
was
demonstrably
guilty
and
he
should
properly
have
been
convicted.
however,
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
never
reached
the
merits
of
our
appeal.
rather,
it
held
that
the
district
court's
action
although
label
the
dismissal
was
in
fact
an
acquittal
as
the
concept
was
defined
in
the
united
against
sisson.
while
the
court
of
appeals
recognize
that
the
amended
criminal
appeals
act
would
authorize
the
government's
appeal
if
the
constitution
permits
it.
it
concluded
that
this
court's
decisions
in
ball,
kepner,
fong
foo
and
sisson
prevented
it.
the
court
of
appeals
as
an
inferior
court
from
allowing
the
appeal
in
this
case.
although
there
is
some
suggestion
that
judge
friendly
felt
that
these
holdings
were
suitable
for
reconsideration
by
this
court.
now
the
issue
in
this
case
may
be
simply
stated,
dopes
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
bar
government
appeal
from
a
post
trial
decision
of
the
district
court
terminating
a
prosecution
in
favor
of
the
defendant
with
such
a
decision
is
an
acquittal
under
the
definition
of
the
concept
in
sisson
if
the
appeal
raises
only
issues
of
law
and
if
a
reversal
would
not
require
the
defendant
to
undergo
a
second
trial.
now
the
constitutional
question
of
the
appealability
of
a
legal
erroneous
acquittal
where
no
second
trial
was
required
is
surprisingly
enough
in
view
of
its
importance,
a
matter
of
first
impression
before
this
court.
later
in
my
argument
show
in
detail
why
this
is
so,
with
reference
to
the
four
cases
relied
upon
by
judge
friendly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
i
will
get
to
it
later,
but
briefly
fong
foo
was
not
in
point
because
what
it
prohibited
was
an
appeal
where
a
retrial
would
be
required.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
true.
i
mean
fong
foo
establishes
the
preposition
that
there
maybe
circumstances
in
which
a
legally
erroneous
acquittal
is
not
reviewable,
but
it
was
not
talking
about
the
circumstances
of
this
case
because
in
fong
foo,
the
trial
had
never
been
completed
and
you
really
were
in
a
summerville
perez
type
of
interrupted
trial
situation
ending
in
acquittal.
that
is
perhaps
close
in
some
ways
adjourn.
the
reason
why
this
is
a
question
of
basically
first
impression
today
in
1974
is
clear
when
you
look
at
the
history
that
common
law
and
under
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
sanges
case,
the
government
had
no
right
of
appeal
in
criminal
cases
in
the
absence
of
a
statute
authorizing
such
appeal.
and
then
in
1907,
congress
pass
the
old
criminal
appeals
act
and
it
was
construed
in
such
a
manner
ultimately
in
sisson,
but
it
had
been
all
along
to
preclude
appeals
in
cases
of
this
sort.
so
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law
prior
to
1971,
the
federal
government
could
not
appeal
rulings
of
this
sort
in
criminal
cases.
moreover,
the
issue
did
not
come
up
in
state
cases
because
the
double
jeopardy
clause
under
the
ruling
in
palko
was
not
being
applicable
to
the
states
until
a
fairly
recent
decision
of
this
court
amendment.
and
i
would
like
here
to
just
point
out
with
respect
to
the
significance
of
betting
something
that
judge
friendly
noted,
which
is
that
the
ruling
that
you
make
in
this
case
today
is
a
ruling
that
will
be
binding
not
only
the
federal
government
but
on
each
of
the
50
states.
and
if
you
say
there
can
be
no
appeal
here,
you
are
saying
that
this
is
a
fundamental
principle
that
is
applicable
equal
force
allover.
and
i
should
note
that
there
are
some
states
that
have
authorized
appeals
in
this
situation
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
as
a
recent
decision
of
the
new
york,
court
of
appeals
in
july
of
this
year
a
case
called
people
against
isabella,
359
new
york
sub
2nd
100.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
certain,
but
i
think
there
is
generally
some
in
--
i
am
told
48
of
the
50
states
do.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
have
a
state
constitutional
provision,
but
of
course
the
interpretation
of
that
might
be
in
accordance
for
instance
with
justice
holms
descent
kepner.
our
position
in
this
case
is
a
very
simple
one.
we
say
that
the
concept
of
double
jeopardy
relates
to
the
subjection
of
the
defendant
[inaudible]
criminal
case
to
a
second
trial
that
therefore
comes
into
play
only
where
second
trail
is
to
be
had
since
our
appeal
if
successful
would
not
lead
to
a
second
trial,
double
jeopardy
is
simply
irrelevant
here
and
the
appeal
is
constitutionally
permissible.
now
in
our
brief,
we
have
set
forth
various
authorities
that
make
it
clear
that
the
element
of
second
trial
was
at
the
heart
of
the
double
jeopardy
notion
at
common
law
and
in
the
application
of
the
american
contintitutional
principle
as
explicated
by
this
court
on
numerous
occasions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
would
have
resulted
in
a
remand,
presumably
it
would
have
resulted
in
a
remand
with
a
direction
to
the
district
court
to
undertake
further
proceedings
under
a
correct
view
of
the
law
and
those
proceedings
would
in
the
absence
of
something
that
does
not
appear
on
the
record
be
the
entry
of
a
judgement
of
conviction.
it
would
not
be
the
taking
of
further
evidence,
it
would
be
the
dismissal
of
this
indictment
and
the
commencement
of
a
new
proceeding
with
a
new
indictment.
it
would
simply
be
--
what
we
are
entitled
to
we
believe
is
a
matter
of
law
as
judgment
of
conviction
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
it
is
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
not
suggesting
that
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
exactly
what
it
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
do.
but
here,
we
have
situation
in
which
the
district
judge
has
found
as
a
fact
every
element
of
the
offense.
he
has
made
his
findings
a
fact.
so
it
is
hard
to
conceive
what
he
could
do.
he
would
have
not
choice
as
a
matter
of
law
when
the
case
goes
back
to
him,
but
to
enter
a
judgment
of
conviction.
now
perhaps
what
the
court
of
appeals
would
do
is
reverse
the
order
of
dismissing
the
indictment
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
its
decision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
assume
they
will
be
if
we
win
this
case
and
the
defendant
does
not
avail
himself
of
the
clemency
opportunity
that
will
be
the
entry
of
a
judgment
of
conviction.
i
can
not
imagine
what
else
the
district
court
could
do
but
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
the
trial
was
completed,
this
order
was
--
judge
travia
entered
three
weeks
after
the
trial
was
over
and
this
order
was
legally
incorrect
that
it
erroneously
dismissed
the
indictment.
now
he
may
have
before
him
other
motions,
motions
for
new
trial,
motions
for
verdict
acquittal
on
some
other
ground.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
before
him.
but
if
he
had
such
motions
before
him
as
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
weinstein
where
a
similar
situation
arose,
the
court
of
appeals
sent
it
back
and
they
said,
“you
could
not
do
what
you
did,
but
now
you
can
consider
the
motions
that
are
before
you
and
proceed
accordingly.”
i
had
to
grant
a
new
trail
which
was
what
was
pending
in
weinstein
or
enter
a
judgment
of
conviction
in
accordance
with
the
jury's
verdict.
i
do
not
see
that
it
is
material
for
purposes
of
this
case,
what
it
is
that
would
happen
in
the
district
court.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
not
asking
for
a
further
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
whatever
else
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
question
is,
what
is
the
relief
that
we
are
requesting.
in
fong
foo,
the
relief
that
was
requested
was
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
acquittal
that
had
been
entered
by
the
district
court
and
to
conduct,
hold
a
new
trial.
now
the
relief
that
we
are
requesting
here
is
not
to
hold
a
new
trial.
there
is
nothing
in
our
appeal
that
requires
a
new
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
i
am
sorry.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
do
not
believe
so,
but
i
think
it
is
not
--
the
trial
was
completed.
let
us
suppose
for
instance
that
the
district
court
had
not
made
these
findings
of
fact.
the
trial
had
simply
–
the
trial
had
been
completed
and
he
has
made
his
ruling
of
law
without
making
the
findings
of
fact
that
are
essential
for
conviction.
and
our
position
is
that
the
case
would
be
remanded
to
him
to
make
findings
of
fact
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
he
heard
at
trial,
which
he
had
not
yet
made.
that
process
is
not
a
second
trial,
whatever
it
maybe
a
continuation
of
the
first
trial,
but
even
that
seems
to
me
questionable
whether
the
evidence
has
been
completed,
the
prosecution
in
the
defense
have
rested
and
submitted
their
case,
made
their
final
statements.
the
trial
is
over.
now
the
question
is
what
legal
consequences
attached
to
the
events
that
occurred
at
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
what
i
am
suggesting
it
should
do.
yes.
even
if
he
had
labeled
in
acquittal,
we
would
say
he
should
--
which
he
did
not
do,
but
had
he
done
it,
we
would
say
that
they
would
reverse
the
order
of
acquittal
and
remand
it
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
their
decision.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
absolutely.
indeed,
i
think
that
analytically
it
is
not
the
appeal
itself
that
ever
violated
double
jeopardy.
the
problem
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
pertinent
because
if
what
the
relief
that
is
requested
by
the
appeal
is
a
new
trail
and
if
we
may
not
because
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
have
a
new
trial,
then
we
are
asking
for
an
advisory
opinion,
there
is
no
case
or
controversy
and
in
that
sense
the
double
jeopardy
clause
bars
the
appeal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
would
distinguish
it
and
if
it
were
entered
at
the
close
of
the
government's
case
and
prior
to
the
defense
in
a
jury
trial.
now
in
a
non-jury
trial,
i
think
it
would
be
somewhat
different
because
you
do
not
need
a
second
trial,
we
would
argue
that
you
would
be
sending
it
back
for
continuation
of
the
first
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
if
it
were
two
years
later,
i
do
not
think
that
the
constitution
would
bar
that
in
a
judge
trial.
the
essential
notion
that
underlies
the
double
jeopardy
protection
is
the
notion
that
there
has
been
a
factual
finding
by
the
trier
of
fact
that
acts
necessary
to
constitute
the
offense
did
not
occur
as
charged
and
it
is
that
finding
as
united
states
against
bowen
makes
clear
and
that
is
the
paradigmatic
double
jeopardy
protection.
it
is
that
finding
which
cannot
be
challenged.
now
if
the
judge
says
at
the
close
of
the
government's
evidence
that
it
shows
that
the
defendant
was
wearing
a
green
hat
and
that
is
an
affirmative
defense
and
therefore
he
enters
a
judgment
of
acquittal.
our
view
is
that
that
should
be
an
appealable
order
even
if
he
does
not
wait
until
the
end
of
the
trial.
but
of
course
we
do
not
have
to
struggle
with
that
here
because
he
did
wait
until
the
end
of
the
trial.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now
i
am
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
suggesting
that
that
as
a
legal
matter
the
only
possibly
correct
action
that
could
have
been
in
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
found
by
the
judge
was
a
verdict
of
guilty.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
direct
in
the
(inaudible)
case
which
we
quote
in
our
brief.
judge
han
addressed
himself
to
the
difference
between
errors
of
judges
and
errors
of
juries
and
he
said
that
the
double
jeopardy
protection
does
not
extend
to
legal
errors
by
judges
and
i
think
(inaudible)
was
one
of
these
motion
in
bar
post
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
did
not
say
that
and
we
are
not
doing
that.
no,
we
are
saying
--
but
the
court
of
appeals
should
do.
i
mean
i
am
saying
to
you
that
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
wait
a
minute.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
the
trial
was
completed
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
it
did
simply
suggested
that
although
it
is
clearly
it
is
quite
inevitable
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
of
course
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
the
verdict
can
be
entered
on
the
remand.
i
do
not
see
the
judgment
can
be
entered
on
the
remand.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
there
are
two
points
that
are
relevant
here.
one
is
that
the
defendant
has
waived
a
jury
trial
and
when
he
waived
the
jury
trial,
he
waived
in
our
view
the
right
to
a
completely
irrational
determination.
and
there
is
a
case
which
judge
friendly
wrote
for
the
second
circuit
called
united
states
against
maybury
in
274
f
2nd
in
which
he
said,
“we
do
not
believe
we
would
enhance
respectful
law
for
the
courts
by
recognizing
for
a
judge
the
same
right
to
indulge
in
forgeries
in
the
disposition
of
criminal
charges
that
for
historic
reasons
has
been
granted
to
the
jury.
now
we
are
saying
that
when
the
defendant
waives
a
jury
trial,
he
waives
in
his
sense
his
right
to
a
completely
rational
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
we
are
straying
somewhat
from
the
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
am
suggesting
that
there
would
be
a
substantial
question
as
to
whether
the
judge
has
the
power
and
we
certainly
think
he
has
the
right
but
whether
he
has
the
power
to
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
the
government
could
not
review.
there
is
a
problem
of
reviewability.
of
course,
if
he
makes
a
finding
that
the
defendant
did
report
for
induction
or
that
he
has
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
failed
to
report
for
induction.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
is
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
if
he
were
to
say
on
second
i
thought
i
have
reasonable
doubt
as
to
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
and
i
find
as
a
fact
that
there
is
a
reasonable
doubt
about
a
certain
necessary
element
of
the
offense,
i
have
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
ever
received
this
notice
to
report
and
therefore
it
is
not
knowing.
there
are
clear
limits
on
our
ability
to
challenge
this
that
is
basically
an
unreviewable
finding
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
guilty.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
our
contention
in
our
brief
of
course
we
have
taken
the
view
that
an
unexplicated
acquittal
is
not
what
is
at
issue
here,
but
in
terms
of
considering
that
the
possible
approaches
to
this
problem
where
we
would
have
a
case
with
an
unexplicated
acquittal,
but
with
findings
of
fact
which
we
are
entitled
to
request
from
the
judge
under
rule
23c
in
which
he
says,
“i
find
beyond
unreasonable
doubt
that
the
three
element
of
the
offense
a,
b,
and
c.”
each
occurred,
and
then
said,
“i
acquit.”
i
think
we
would
take
the
position
in
such
case
and
that
is
not
this
case
that
we
could
have
appellant
review.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
at
all
because
we
are
not
asking
that
we
start
the
proceeding
over
again
with
the
taking
of
new
evidence
before
the
judge,
which
is
what
jeopardy
consist
of.
i
am
not
asking
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
make
two
points
about
that.
first
of
all,
it
did
not
say
any
further
proceedings.
it
said
that
you
cannot
have
an
appeal
because
what
the
government
is
asking
for,
you
cannot
have
mandamus,
you
cannot
have
appellant
review.
so
what
the
government
is
asking
for
is
to
start
the
whole
proceeding
over
again
and
panel
of
new
jury
begin
all
over
again.
that
is
not
our
case.
it
is
not
remotely
like
our
case.
there
simply
is
no
question
of
having
a
second
trial
in
this
case
in
a
sense
which
double
–
it
is
relevant
to
double
jeopardy
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
the
second
point
about
fong
foo
is
that
the
issue
of
whether
an
acquittal
could
be
appeal
was
never
argued
and
fong
foo.
the
government
simply
rested
its
contention
in
that
case
on
the
contention
of
what
happened
that
was
not
an
acquittal
and
not
at
all
on
the
question
of
whether
which
is
here
today
about
the
appealability
of
acquittals.
that
was
assumed
is
given
by
all
parties
and
they
are
only
in
the
context
where
reversal
would
lead
to
a
second
trial.
now
before
getting
to
the
cases
in
detail,
i
would
like
to
consider
the
ramifications
of
policy
for
this
issue.
the
effect
of
the
ruling
below
as
well
as
that
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
wilson
is
to
let
a
clearly
guilty
defendant.
that
is
one
that
has
been
found
by
the
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
have
committed
all
the
acts
constituting
the
offense,
to
let
such
a
defendant
go
free
because
of
a
trial
judges
erroneous
interpretation
of
a
point
of
law.
now
we
submit
that
one
is
hard
pressed
to
imagine
how
such
a
result
furthers
the
ends
of
public
justice.
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said
in
dealing
with
a
related
question
in
united
states
against
tateo
which
is
in
377
u.s.
at
page
466
corresponding
to
the
right
of
an
accused
to
be
given
a
fair
trail
is
the
societal
interest
one
whose
guilt
is
clear
after
he
has
obtained
such
a
trial
to
what
mr.
jenkins.
it
would
be
a
high
price
indeed
for
society
to
pay
where
every
accused
granted
immunity
from
punishment
because
of
any
defects
efficient
to
constitute
reversible
error
in
the
proceedings
leading
to
conviction.
now
there,
he
was
talking
about
a
retrial
after
a
conviction,
but
i
think
the
thoughts
a
policy
matter
in
terms
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
what
kind
of
protection
we
are
affording
to
defendants
if
we
adopt
the
role
of
the
second
circuit
in
this
case.
i
think
the
thoughts
are
pertinent.
he
also
made
another
point
in
this
connection,
in
tat
paragraph
into
tail
in
which
he
said
that
if
the
rule
or
otherwise
appellant
courts
would
be
lower
to
apply
the
laws
as
they
saw
fit
in
reverse
convictions
because
the
consequence
would
be
to
immunize
the
defendant
from
a
retrial.
well,
the
same
thing
is
true
here
if
you
say
that
an
error
of
law
by
the
district
court
committed
on
a
motion
such
as
this
forever
immunizes
the
defendant
from
further
proceedings
no
matter
how
erroneous
the
ruling
is,
then
district
judges
are
going
to
be
reluctant
to
make
these
rulings
the
way
they
see
fit.
they
will
leave
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
order
to
avoid
these
manifestly
on
just
situations.
so
it
is
not
an
unmitigated
blessing
for
the
defendant
if
you
were
to
adopt
the
position
of
the
second
circuit.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
on
the
question
of
whether
there
has
to
be
a
retrial,
which
seems
to
be
focal
here,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
our
appeal
which
asks
on
behalf
of
the
government
that
there
would
be
a
new
trial
in
this
case
as
a
result
of
the
correction
of
error.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
maybe
they
would
and
maybe
they
would
be
entitled
to
one
and
if
they
request
one
and
are
entitled
too
on
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
preclude
that
relief.
but
we
are
not
at
that
stage
and
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
the
mercado
case
and
to
understand
that
we
do
not
have
here
an
issue
of
fact
in
any
significant
sense.
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
in
the
record
in
this
case
nor
is
there
anything
in
judge
travia's
decision
that
basis
itself
on
actual
reliance
by
this
registrant
on
the
law
of
the
second
circuit,
i
suppose
to
constructive
reliance
on
the
law.
there
is
no
reference
in
fact
to
reliance
on
the
law
but
to
the
unfairness
of
applying
it
retroactively.
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
we
think
mercado
makes
it
clear
that
even
if
he
did
in
fact
rely
on
the
prior
law
of
the
second
circuit,
he
would
have
no
defense.
what
the
court
said
in
mercado
was
upholding
the
conviction
of
a
register
to
claims
to
have
relied
on
preexisting
case
law
would
appear
to
be
no
more
than
an
application
of
the
settled
rule,
but
an
erroneous
belief
that
induction
orders
in
valid
even
if
based
on
the
advise
of
counsel
is
not
a
defense
to
a
prosecution
for
refusing
induction
and
the
one
who
refuses
induction
on
the
basis
of
such
belief
acts
at
his
parole.
that
is
the
law
in
second
circuit.
they
talked
about
a
possible
exception,
but
it
is
that
exception
would
be
prior
to
the
time
of
this
courts
grant
of
certiorari
in
ehlert
because
they
said
that
the
grant
of
certiorari
in
ehlert
cast
geary
into
sufficient
question
that
nobody
could
properly
relying
on
the
second
circuit
law.
jenkins
and
mercado
were
factually
situated
in
the
identical
circumstance.
let
me
say
further,
there
has
been
a
reference
to
an
offer
of
proof
with
respect
to
the
draft
councilor,
mr.
bobbled.
now
if
you
look
at
page
70
of
the
appendiz,
you
will
exactly
what
that
offer
of
proof
was.
mr.
carroll
said
that
what
mr.
bobbled
would
testify
to,
was
that
after
discussing
mr.
jenkins
case
with
him
for
some
time,
mr.
bobbled
elicited
from
the
registrant
the
fact
that
he
would
contentiously
oppose
to
all
wars.
and
it
was
only
at
this
time
that
mr.
jenkins
became
aware
of
this
conscientious
opposition
to
all
wars
and
there
was
further
inquiry
into
this
matter
of
the
offer
of
proof
and
on
page
71,
mr.
carroll
said,
“i
think
the
sincerity
of
the
registrant
is
an
issue.”
and
later
on
page
73,
the
court
said,
“how
is
he
going
to
change
the
facts
with
his
testimony.”
mr.
carroll
said
he
is
going
to
amplify
on
the
sincerity
of
the
registrants
beliefs
which
i
state
was
tested
by
the
local
board
prior
to
any
type
of
permissive
hearing
by
the
local
board.
and
the
testimony
of
mr.
jenkins
went
to
the
question
of
sincerity
and
that
was
irrelevant
to
this
issue.
my
time
has
expired.
