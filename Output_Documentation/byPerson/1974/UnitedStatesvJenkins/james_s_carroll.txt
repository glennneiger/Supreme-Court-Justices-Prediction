mr.
james
s.
carroll
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
i
please
the
court.
the
issue
that
the
court
will
have
to
determine
after
the
submission
of
the
briefs
and
the
oral
argument
in
this
case,
is
whether
the
united
states
had
the
right
to
appeal
from
the
district
court's
order
acquitting
the
defendant
in
this
case
after
trial
and
after
the
defendant
had
been
put
into
jeopardy.
whether
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
correct
in
its
determination
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
under
either
section
3731
of
title
18
or
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
hear
and
determine
this
appeal.
the
government
contends
that
the
district
court's
decision
was
appealable
because
it
was
purely
legal
ruling
with
undisputed
findings
of
fact
and
that
this
is
purely
legal
ruling
could
be
corrected
by
the
mere
expedient
of
sending
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
to
enter
a
judgment
of
conviction.
aside
from
the
fact
that
i
feel
that
such
a
cause
goes
directly
counted
to
the
spirit
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
suppose
to
protect.
i
do
not
think
that
this
particular
position
by
the
government
has
any
sanction
or
any
support
in
the
cases
of
this
court.
as
our
contention
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
judge
was
one
that
was
based
on
facts
do
set
the
trial
which
went
to
the
general
issue
of
the
case
and
as
such
this
was
an
acquittal
from
which
no
appeal
was
to
be
allowed.
in
addition,
we
question
whether
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
a
purely
legal
ruling
and
whether
this
so
called
legal
ruling
could
be
corrected
by
the
simple
expedient
of
directing
a
judgment
of
conviction.
we
further
question
whether
the
government
has
complied
with
section
3731
of
the
criminal
appeals
act
in
that
this
appeal
was
not
expeditiously
prosecuted
as
is
mandated
by
section
3731.
to
delve
in
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
on
february
4th,
1971,
mr.
jenkins
received
a
notice
to
report
for
induction.
directly
thereafter
and
this
notice
to
report
of
induction
–
excuse
me,
it
was
february
24th
of
1971.
directly
thereafter,
mr.
jenkins
went
to
a
draft
counselor
by
the
name
jerome
bobbled,
in
turn,
mr.
bobbled
contacted
myself.
subsequently,
mr.
jenkins
mailed
a
letter
to
the
local
board
requesting
a
co150
form,
and
to
this,
he
received
no
response
from
the
local
board.
on
february
23rd
of
1974,
the
date
before
mr.
jenkins
was
to
report
for
induction,
mr.
jenkins
went
to
the
local
board,
he
had
conversation
with
mrs.
elaine
morris,
the
secretary
of
the
local
board
and
he
asked
that
he
be
given
a
co150
form
and
that
his
induction
date
be
postponed.
at
that
time,
mrs.
morris
called
new
york
city
headquarters
and
spoke
to
mr.
thomas
mahan,
who
was
the
chief
of
the
legal
division
of
selected
service
headquarters
in
new
york
city.
mr.
mahan
directed
that
mr.
jenkins
write
out
a
brief
statement
of
his
beliefs
in
opposition
to
war.
after
doing
so
and
after
reading
this
brief
statement
to
mr.
mahan
over
the
telephone,
mr.
mahan
determined
that
mr.
jenkins
had
not
made
out
a
prima
facie
case
for
opposition
to
owe
a
war
because
mr.
jenkins
in
a
statement
had
said
that
he
was
opposed
to
the
war,
this
present
war
although
he
did
not
exclude
opposition
to
owe
a
war
in
his
statement.
mr.
james
s.
carroll
mr.
mahan
was
the
director
of
a
legal
division
of
selective
service
headquarters
in
new
york
city.
mr.
mahan
is
presently
a
us
attorney
in
the
eastern
district
of
new
york.
at
the
time
of
the
prosecution
of
this
case,
mr.
mahan
was
the
us
attorney
assigned
to
prosecute
this
case.
in
fact,
a
motion
was
made
directly
prior
to
the
trial
to
have
mr.
mahan
excluded
from
prosecuting
the
case
and
subsequently
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
mr.
mahan
appeared
as
a
witness
for
the
government
to
detail
the
facts
that
i
have
just
gone
into
before
the
court.
on
february
24th,
mr.
jenkins
did
not
report
for
induction.
we
have
not
disputed
this
but
later
on
in
march
of
1971,
mr.
jenkins
did
return
the
co
form
to
them
local
board.
no
action
was
taken
on
that
form.
it
was
in
april
of
1971
that
ehlert
v.
united
states
was
decided.
ehlert
intervened
between
the
date
that
mr.
jenkins
was
to
report
for
induction
and
return
the
co150
form
and
the
date
that
mr.
jenkins
was
subsequently
indicted
for
failure
to
report
for
induction.
on
october
3rd
of
1972,
the
case
came
to
trial.
we
waived
trial
by
jury,
the
original
prosecutor,
mr.
mahan
was
substituted
and
the
government
presented
two
witnesses,
the
executive
secretary
of
the
local
board
in
thomas
mahan.
it
is
true
that
before
trial,
we
had
asked
for
45
days
in
which
to
present
all
motions.
no
pretrial
motions
were
presented
because
the
selective
service
file
was
turned
over
to
us,
which
gave
us
all
of
the
discovery
that
we
required
in
the
particular
case.
the
defense
presented
three
witness,
mr.
jenkins,
the
defendant,
mr.
jenkins'
mother
and
mr.
jerome
bobbled
who
is
mr.
jenkins
draft
counselor.
however,
mr.
bobbled's
testimony
was
not
allowed
in
the
case
although
we
had
made
an
offer
approve
that
mr.
bobbled
would
show
that
mr.
jenkins
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
he
could
present
a
co150
form
at
this
time
according
to
the
applicable
case
law
at
that
time
and
that
mr.
jenkins
believes
in
opposition
to
war
crystallized
after
the
date
that
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction,
but
before
the
date
of
actual
induction.
this
was
pursuant
to
the
applicable
case
law
in
the
second
circuit
at
that
time.
as
i
stated,
the
court
excluded
mr.
bobbled's
testimony
although
an
offer
approve
was
made.
we
also
had
three
other
witnesses
who
were
character
witnesses.
however,
we
stipulated
to
their
testimony.
after
the
trial
of
the
case,
judge
travia
requested
whether
we
would
like
to
argue
at
the
particular
time
as
to
mr.
jenkins
guilt
to
innocence
of
the
offense
or
whether
we
would
prefer
to
submit
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
we
opted
for
the
latter
and
we
submitted
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
proposed
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
to
judge
travia.
several
weeks
thereafter
the
judgment
was
rendered,
the
government
states
that
this
was
a
dismissal
of
an
indictment.
in
fact
in
judge
travia's
opinion
after
findings
of
fact
and
after
his
discussion
of
the
applicable
law,
judge
travia
did
in
fact
state
that
the
indictment
in
this
case
is
dismissed
and
the
defendant
is
discharged.
mr.
james
s.
carroll
yes
i
did.
mr.
james
s.
carroll
i
requested
that
judgment
of
acquittal
be
rendered.
i
never
requested
that
the
indictment
be
dismissed.
in
fact,
to
go
into
that
briefly,
the
--
mr.
james
s.
carroll
no,
i
asked
for
acquittal
from
the
judge.
mr.
james
s.
carroll
i
--
mr.
james
s.
carroll
yes
but
--
mr.
james
s.
carroll
that
is
correct.
throughout
the
course
of
this
proceedings
however,
i
was
maintaining
not
simply
that
on
the
law,
ehlert
v.
united
states
was
not
retroactive.
in
fact,
i
never
made
such
a
broad
side
attack
against
ehlert
v.
united
states.
in
fact
was
that
with
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
mr.
jenkins
case,
mr.
jenkins
was
represented
by
council
and
he
had
consulted
a
draft
council,
but
prior
to
this,
he
was
aware
of
the
applicable
case
law.
the
local
board
received
his
co150
form
and
did
not
act
on
it
even
though
geary
at
that
time
requiring
that
they
do
so.
and
ehlert
came
down
one
month
after
all
of
these
transactions
and
my
position
was
and
i
think
the
position
that
judge
travia
adopted
was
it
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
jenkins
case
that
ehlert
v.
united
states
should
not
be
applied
to
him
that
in
fact
ehlert
v.
united
states
would
have
been
unduly
harsh
in
the
circumstances
of
mr.
jenkins
case.
i
would
like
to
point
out
also
that
mr.
jenkins
did
take
the
stand
that
during
the
course
of
these
proceedings
while
mr.
jenkins
was
testifying
judge
travia
interrupted
my
direct
examination
several
times.
in
fact,
at
one
point
during
the
direct
examination,
judge
travia
took
over
the
direct
examination
and
questioned
mr.
jenkins
very
closely
about
his
sincerity
and
went
in
very
deeply
into
mr.
jenkins
credibility
in
stating
that
he
was
in
fact
a
conscientious
objective.
i
have
also
raised
another
issue
which
i
did
not
explore
in
much
debt
in
brief,
but
i
would
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
that
the
trial
in
this
case
commenced
on
october
3rd
of
1972,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
rendered
on
october
24th
of
1972.
the
government's
notice
of
appeal
was
filed
on
november
21st,
1972,
its
brief
however
was
not
filled
until
june
13th
of
1973.
in
his
decision
dated
december
11th
of
1973,
the
court
of
appeals
admonished
the
government
and
stated
that
the
government
had
not
in
their
view
complied
with
section
3731's
mandate
that
the
appeals
be
diligently
prosecuted
by
the
government.
they
stated
in
a
footnote
that
the
delay
in
appealing
the
case
by
the
government
–
and
i
quote,
they
stated
this
casually
conforms
with
our
notion
of
diligent
prosecution
and
we
would
have
dismissed
the
appeal
on
that
ground
if
defendant
had
so
requested.
after
this
decision
came
down,
the
government
requested
one
extension
of
time
to
petition
for
rehearing
before
the
court
of
appeals.
rehearing
was
denied
on
february
6
of
1974.
later,
the
government
asked
for
an
extension
of
time
to
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court,
and
by
order
of
mr.
justice
marshall
on
february
28th
of
1974,
the
time
for
filling
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
extended
to
april
7th
of
1974,
the
petition
being
filed
on
april
8th.
it
was
on
may
28
of
1974
that
the
petition
was
granted.
again,
on
july
10th
of
1974,
the
government
requested
an
extension
of
time
to
file
the
brief
to
july
24th
of
1974,
which
was
granted.
the
brief
for
the
government
was
not
received
by
my
office
until
september
17th
of
1974.
similarly,
and
i
do
not
think
i
coming
into
this
court
with
unclean
hands
although
i
am
asking
equitable
relief.
on
october
10th
of
this
year,
i
requested
an
extension
of
one
month's
time
to
november
14th,
1974.
the
argument
was
set
today
of
course.
i
think
that
under
the
statute
itself
that
the
government
has
not
complied
with
the
mandate
in
section
3731
to
prosecute
appeals
diligently.
i
think
--
mr.
james
s.
carroll
no,
i
had
not
so
requested.
i
do
not
think
however
that
i
waive
the
right
to
bring
this
to
this
court's
attention
however
because
i
think
its
an
affirmative
obligation
on
the
government's
part
to
comply
with
all
sections
of
that
particular
statute.
mr.
james
s.
carroll
i
am
suggesting
that
--
mr.
james
s.
carroll
yes.
mr.
james
s.
carroll
yes.
i
am
suggesting
mr.
justice
black
that
the
government
or
rather
this
appeal
should
be
dismissed
on
two
grounds.
first,
that
the
government
has
not
complied
with
section
3731
and
that
this
particular
appeal
is
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
on
the
second
ground
that
--
mr.
james
s.
carroll
excuse
me.
mr.
james
s.
carroll
well
i
am
talking
about
the
original
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
i
think
is
what
is
an
issue
now
whether
the
court
of
appeals
originally
had
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
appeal.
but
i
am
also
stating
that
because
of
the
fact
that
the
government
has
not
complied
with
all
of
the
provisions
of
section
3731
and
that
they
have
not
diligently
prosecuted
the
appeal
that
on
that
separate
ground,
the
original
appeal
should
not
have
been
allowed.
the
government
had
made
several
statements
in
which
they
try
to
take
this
particular
case
out
of
the
traditional
case
of
an
acquittal
being
rendered
after
a
trial
before
a
judge
or
a
jury.
they
first
make
the
distinction
between
a
purely
legal
ruling
and
the
ruling
on
the
facts.
i
think
this
particular
distinction
is
unattainable.
i
think
that
in
this
particular
case,
individual
facts
were
conceded
by
the
district
court
in
making
its
final
ruling
that
the
indictment
should
be
dismissed.
in
fact,
the
court
went
very
deeply
into
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
and
again,
as
i
have
stated,
the
court
found
that
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case
that
jenkins
was
not
guilty.
it
stated
that
under
the
facts
of
the
case
were
jenkins
was
a
priced
other
law,
other
second
circuit,
which
differed
from
other
circuits
at
that
time
that
jenkins
should
not
be
found
guilty
of
refusing
to
submit
to
induction.
this
case
should
not
be
any
different
because
a
judge
made
articulated
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
a
judge
as
what
is
stated
in
united
states
v.
mayberry
does
not
have
the
luxury
to
issue
simply
a
judgment
of
not
guilty
or
guilty.
in
fact,
he
must
make
findings
of
fact
in
conclusions
of
law,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
in
this
particular
case
judge
travia
was
acting
as
a
fact
finder
that
the
finding
of
fact
cannot
be
limited
only
to
the
findings
of
fact
that
he
articulated.
i
think
he
found
nine
facts
in
the
case.
but
i
believe
that
through
his
discussion,
he
indicated
that
he
had
gone
deeply
into
this
defendants
credibility
and
he
indicated
that
this
was
part
of
his
decisions
that
jenkins
would
be
unduly
prejudice
by
a
different
finding
by
the
court.
i
could
analogize
this
situation
to
one
that
was
stated
in
the
sisson
case
where
the
judge
had
stated
to
the
jury,
if
you
find
such
facts,
then
you
will
render
a
verdict
not
guilty
and
i
think
it
was
the
same
thing.
judge
travia
found
such
facts
articulated
in
his
findings
of
fact
and
articulated
in
his
discussion
of
the
law
and
on
the
basis
of
that,
he
found
that
jenkins
was
not
guilty.
if
for
example,
a
judge
had
given
erroneous
instructions
to
a
jury
of
if
for
example,
a
jury
had
applied
a
judge's
correct
instructions
on
the
law
erroneously
in
the
same
way,
such
a
verdict
from
the
jury
would
not
be
subject
to
any
review
as
it
was
stated
in
united
states
v.
ball.
mr.
james
s.
carroll
i
think
that
if
the
court
finds
that
there
is
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
if
the
case
would
have
to
be
sent
back
to
judge
travia
for
retrial.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
an
affirmative
defense
could
be
asserted
that
jenkins
had
in
good
faith
relied
upon
the
existing
case
law
in
the
circuit
at
that
time
in
refusing
induction.
now,
although
i
think
that
judge
travia
did
make
such
a
finding,
although
not
expressly
articulated
or
impliedly
articulated,
i
think
that
the
time
of
trial,
judge
travia
believe
that
it
was
improper
to
go
into
that
question
at
the
trial
stage.
when
i
asked
that
mr.
bobbled,
the
counselor
takes
the
stand,
the
government
asked
for
an
offer
of
proof
and
when
my
offer
of
proof
was
that
mr.
bobbled
would
testify
as
to
mr.
jenkins
conversations
with
him
and
that
mr.
jenkins
believes
in
opposition
to
war
crystallize
after
february
4th
of
1971,
but
before
february
24th
of
1971.
judge
travia
excluded
that
testimony
because
he
believed
that
it
would
not
be
relevant
and
he
believe
in
fact
that
it
would
be
redundant
of
what
was
already
in
the
selective
service
file.
mr.
james
s.
carroll
i
am
saying
that.
i
am
also
stating
that
the
distinction
that
the
government
makes
between
a
pure
legal
ruling
and
findings
of
fact
is
not
articulated
anywhere
in
the
case
law
and
in
fact
is
directly
contradicted
by
the
case
law.
sisson
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
rule
of
a
test
is
to
be
used
is
whether
on
the
basis
of
facts
adduced
at
the
trial
going
to
the
general
issue
of
the
case,
whether
the
defendant
is
guilty
or
not
guilty.
mr.
james
s.
carroll
i
imagine
that
parties
would
start
from
scratch,
but
the
first
motion
that
would
be
made
in
such
a
case
would
be
a
motion
in
bar
to
stop
such
a
trial
on
the
grounds
of
double
jeopardy,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
go
that
far
because
i
think
the
appeal
in
this
case
alone
puts
the
defendant
in
double
jeopardy.
i
feel
that
there
was
an
acquittal
in
this
case
that
any
subsequent
proceedings
in
this
case
put
the
defendant
into
double
jeopardy.
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
for
the
government
to
go
to
the
expense
of
having
this
case
sent
back
for
another
trial
when
the
only
thing
that
would
resolve
from
such
a
cause
would
be
for
that
trial
to
itself
be
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
james
s.
carroll
that
is
correct
if
it
does
in
fact
go
back,
that
would
be
the
determination.
but
i
think
that
in
a
sense
the
government
has
thrown
in
a
confusing
factor
by
asking
whether
in
fact
it
would
require
a
new
trial
or
whether
a
judgment
of
conviction
could
simply
be
entered.
i
think
that
is
putting
a
cart
before
the
horse.
the
initial
question
is
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
appeal
and
whether
the
court
of
appeals
initially
had
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
appeal.
what
would
happen
subsequently
is
not
directly
in
point.
if
this
court
does
reached
the
merits
of
this
case
however,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
ruling
of
the
district
judge
was
correct
under
the
circumstances
and
that
although
he
was
not
stating
an
ehlert
did
not
apply
or
cases,
he
was
correct
in
stating
that
ehlert
did
not
apply
to
the
particular
situation
involved
in
united
states
v.
jenkins.
i
think
the
government's
appeal
is
barred
by
the
applicable
case
law
starting
with
united
states
v.
ball,
continuing
to
kepner
v.
united
states
and
ending
up
with
fong
foo
and
sisson.
the
court
has
stated
repeatedly
that
an
appeal
alone
is
barred
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
that
this
true
whether
the
trial
is
before
a
judge
or
before
a
jury
and
that
the
test
to
be
used
is
not
whether
it
was
a
pure
legal
ruling
or
a
factual
ruling,
but
whether
on
the
basis
of
facts
adduce
a
trail,
the
judge
went
to
the
general
issue
of
guilty
or
not
guilty.
thank
you.
