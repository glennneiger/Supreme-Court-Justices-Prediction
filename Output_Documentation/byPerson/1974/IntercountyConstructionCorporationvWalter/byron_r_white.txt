did
you
just
read
that
language
out
on
the
section
then
whether
or
not
any
compensation
order
has
been
issued.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
ignore
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
it
hasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
suppose
it
hasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
reads
right
on
it
whether
or
not
and
this
covers
the
possibility
and
order
hasn't
been
issued
and
nevertheless
says
within
one
year
after
the
date
of
last
payment
you're
supposed
to
file
something?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
point.
well
you
must
concede
that's
the
plain
reading
of
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
that
i
talked
about
whether
it
has
been
one
and
why
doesn't
this
section
apply
to
a
situation
where
an
award
has
issued
because
it
seems
to
apply
to
a
case,
whether
--
where
a
compensation
has
not
issued.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
nothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
don't
--
who's
confused,
that's
the
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
that
the
employee
is
locked
into
his
--
if
more
than
a
year
has
passed
since
the
injury,
he
is
locked
in
to
the
claim
that
he
has
originally
filed,
he
can't
amend
that
claim
and
claim
permanent
disability
when
he
originally
filed
for
temporary?
