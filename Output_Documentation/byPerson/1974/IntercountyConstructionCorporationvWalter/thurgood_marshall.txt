mr.
easterbrook,
as
i
read
your
brief,
you've
ignored
strachan
shipping,
are
you
going
to
ignore
it
in
your
argument
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
was
this
one
end?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
will
this
one
end?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
the
part
i'm
talking
about,
that's
in
extraordinary
circumstance.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
remain
in
place.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
man
remain
in
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
submit
is
dismissal
like
a
prosecution,
its
done
everyday.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
procedure
here
for
doing
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
because
of
this
any
action,
this
man
has
a
right
at
any
time
within
his
lifetime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
think
if
you
give
me
that
--
if
you
file
a
case
at
the
district
court
and
you
don't
do
anything
with
it
and
then
20
years
later
you
come
back
and
file
another
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
you
can't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
periodically
in
the
district
court,
the
court
called
all
the
cases
in
and
says
either
move
or
drop
and
get
out,
they
claimed
it,
they
keep
a
clean
target.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
these
people
don't
keep,
they
don't
even
pretend
to
do
it
but
you're
relying
on
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
deputy
did
not
act,
is
that
what
you're
relying
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
applied
to
all
of
the
cases
that
are
informally
close?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
suppose
to
a
million
nine
other
than
some
thousand.i
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
should
be
a
considerable
number.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
yes,
yes.
for
some
of
those
like
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
--
oh,
that
means
several
hundred
in
the
past.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
each
of
the
past
years.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
have
the
slightest
idea
how
many.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
know
how
many
people,
how
many
units
do
you?
you
don't
have
a
clue.
