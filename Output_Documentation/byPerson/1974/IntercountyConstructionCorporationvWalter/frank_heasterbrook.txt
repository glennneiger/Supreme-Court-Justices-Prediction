mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
turns
on
the
meaning
of
a
single
clause
in
section
22
of
the
act.
the
clause
appears
to
mark
off
a
period
of
time.
it
reads
prior
to
one
year
after
the
date
of
the
last
payment
of
compensation,
whether
or
not
a
compensation
order
has
been
issued.
petitioners
argued
that
because
this
clause
refers
to
time,
it
must
be
the
time
within
which
an
injured
employee
must
file
a
piece
of
paper
to
prevent
some
effect
on
his
claim
for
compensation.
we
agree
with
the
petitioners
to
this
point.
any
application
for
relief
pursuant
to
section
22
must
be
filed
within
the
time
established
by
that
clause.
the
more
difficult
question
is
who
is
required
to
file
that
piece
of
paper?
we
submit
that
the
only
people
required
to
file
within
the
time
limit
established
by
that
clause
are
those
who
seek
what
the
section
title
of
section
22
says
it
is
about,
a
modification
of
an
award.
petitioner's
argument
rest
on
the
premise
that
because
some
employees
must
file
within
the
established
time,
then
all
employees
must
do
so.
nothing
in
the
statute
supports
that
result.
the
more
accurate
reading
of
the
section
is
that
those
who
seek
to
modify
an
award
or
a
compensation
order
on
the
grounds
of
mistake
of
fact
or
change
in
circumstances
must
file
under
section
22
within
one
year
after
the
date
of
the
last
payment
of
compensation,
whether
that
compensation
was
paid
with
or
without
an
award.
but
those
who
seek
not
modification
but
an
initial
adjudication
of
a
claim
timely
filed
long
ago
need
not
do
so.
they
are
entitled
to
at
least
one
adjudication
by
virtue
of
that
claim
and
the
respondent
in
this
case
filed
a
timely
claim
less
than
a
mount
after
his
injury.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
the
original
claim
must
be
filed
within
either
a
year
after
the
injury
or
a
year
after
the
last
payment
of
compensation
without
an
award.
there
are
two
alternative
provisions
for
filing.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
right,
right.
there
is
no
disagreement
on
that
and
there
is
no
disagreement
on
the
fact
that
this
claim
was
in
fact
timely
filed.
once
that
claim
is
timely
filed,
section
19
(a)
of
the
act
gives
to
the
deputy
commissioner
power
to
adjudicate
that
claim.
section
19
(a)
provides
that
subject
only
to
section
13,
subject
only
to
section
13
which
provides
for
the
timely
filing
of
a
claim,
a
deputy
commissioner
has
full
authority
to
adjudicate
any
claim
that
has
been
filed.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
section
19
(a)
is
in
the
government's
brief
and
the
statutory
section
at
page
3,
procedure
in
respect
of
claims
subject
to
the
provisions
of
section
13,
claim
for
compensation
may
be
filed
and
the
deputy
commissioner
shall
have
full
power
and
authority
to
hear
and
determine
all
questions
in
respect
of
such
claim.
a
claim
was
timely
filed
in
this
case
and
section
19
(a)
provides
the
deputy
commissioner
shall
have
full
power.
petitioner's
assertion
is
that
a
new
application
must
be
filed
under
section
22
even
though
a
timely
claim
has
been
filed
under
section
13.
the
trust
of
our
argument
is
that
that
single
clause
in
section
22
has
to
be
read
in
context.
read
alone
or
solely
within
the
bounce
of
the
section,
there
is
little
indication
who
must
file
the
piece
of
paper
to
which
he
refers.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
right.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
the
critical
clause
in
section
22.
that
clause
tells
us
when
an
application
pursuant
to
section
22
has
to
be
filed.
it
does
not
tell
us
and
it
does
not
purport
to
tell
us
who
it
is
that
must
file
it.
as
in
most
balance
of
statutory
interpretation,
we
feel
that
it's
necessary
to
look
to
the
history
of
the
act
and
to
the
language
and
structure
of
the
act
to
understand
who
it
is
that
must
file.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
justice
rehnquist,
if
compensation
is
paid
without
an
award,
it
may
terminate
before
the
award
has
been
issued
or
it
may
terminate
prior
to
the
award
after
the
award
has
been
issued.
suppose
there
is
an
injury
suffered
by
an
employee
and
under
the
generally
voluntary
and
cooperative
procedure
used
by
the
act,
the
employer
begins
to
make
payments
without
waiting
an
award
as
the
act
says
he
should
and
must
do.
then
payments
may
terminate
at
any
time
because
the
employer
has
decided
that
the
disability
has
ended.
has
decided
that
he
wants
to
controvert
the
claim
and
seek
an
adjudication
now
and
so
on.
after
the
payments
have
terminated,
the
deputy
commissioner
may
well
then
make
an
award
of
compensation
which
might
verify
the
compensation
that
has
previously
been
paid
without
awarding
new
compensation,
so
that
the
compensation
would
have
terminated
without
an
award
having
been
issued.
the
date
for
which
time
must
be
computed
runs
from
the
date
of
compensation
has
terminated
and
not
on
the
date
of
the
payment.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
oh,
the
title
originally
was
inserted
in
1927
when
the
provision
supplied
only
to
awards
and
an
award
meant
in
1927,
an
order
compelling
an
employer
to
pay
compensation.
in
1938,
an
amendment
was
made
in
this
section
providing
that
a
compensation
order
that
denied
compensation
was
also
reviewable.
so
there
are
--
there
is
one
general
class
of
this
here
and
that's
the
compensation
order
which
may
award
compensation
or
deny
compensation.
it
used
to
be
that
under
this
section,
you
could
get
review
only
of
an
award
which
gave
compensation.
in
this
case
--
in
this
case
you
didn't
have
an
award
either
granting
or
denying
compensation
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
right.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
and
the
answer
is
you
can't
which
is
why
section
22
does
not
apply
to
this
case
at
all.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
the
title
is
inapplicable
in
all
cases
in
which
there
has
been
no
award
of
compensation
or
any
formal
or
the
denying
compensation
and
that's
precisely
the
point
upon
which
we
rely
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
title
of
this
section
is
inapplicable
and
indeed
the
entire
section
is
inapplicable
in
this
case.
nothing
has
occurred
under
section
22
that
would
trigger
its
applicability
because
nothing
has
occurred
under
that
section.
there
is
no
need
to
make
an
application
for
a
review
whether
or
not
within
a
year
after
the
last
payment
of
compensation.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
no
we
don't.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
no
we
don't
justice
white
and
i
think
we
can
make
a
good
deal
of
sense
of
it.
suppose
a
compensation
order
has
been
issued
in
a
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
if
it
has
not
been
issued
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
right,
as
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
no,
i
think
we
can
make
a
little
bit
more
sense
of
it
than
that.
is
that
suppose
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
i
think
there's
a
plain
reading
of
it
that
bears
on
the
case
where
an
award
has
been
issued.
suppose
an
award
had
been
issued
in
this
case.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
i
think
there
is
a
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
it's
an
easily
understandable
confusion.
the
language
of
the
section
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
it's
a
question
of
interpretation.
the
language
of
the
section
certainly
bears
on
cases
where
compensation
orders
have
not
been
issued.
the
question
is
of
the
nature
of
the
baring.
does
it
bear
on
cases
where
compensation
orders
have
not
been
issued
so
that
it
sets
the
time
within
which
you
have
to
apply
in
those
cases?
or
does
it
bear
on
cases
in
which
compensation
orders
have
been
issued
to
establish
a
time
that
runs
from
a
time
before
when
the
order
was
issued.
our
interpretation
is
the
latter.
suppose
we
can
make
sense
of
it
by
saying
in
all
cases
where
compensation
orders
have
been
issued,
the
time
runs
from
the
time
of
the
last
payment
of
compensation
whether
or
not
that
compensation
was
pursuant
to
an
award
so
that
the
--
whether
or
not
there
has
been
an
award
determines
the
time
for
which
you
must
apply
when
an
award
is
eventually
issued.
if
the
last
payment
of
compensation
terminates
prior
to
an
award,
the
one
year
period
begins
to
run
prior
to
the
award
but
unless
there
is
actually
an
award
entered,
the
compensation
order
entered.
the
time
limit
provision
is
completely
inapplicable
to
that
claimant.
i
think
this
can
be
understood
a
little
bit
more
simply
by
looking
back
at
the
history
of
this
act
in
1927.
in
1927,
the
act
is
enacted
clearly
provided
only
for
modification
of
awards.
we
think
petitioners
have
so
conceded
the
court
has
understood
it
at
that
time
so
understood
it.
so
that
in
1927,
if
compensation
terminated
prior
to
an
award,
there
was
no
possibility
of
reviewing
that
award
because
the
time
for
computation
of
review
expired
the
moment
the
last
payment
of
compensation
with
our
without
award.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
in
many
cases
justice
rehnquist,
employers
would
pay
compensation
without
the
necessity
of
an
award.
they
are
required
to
do
so
under
the
act
within
14
days
of
the
injury.
the
administrative
process
often
took
a
good
deal
longer
than
that
to
enter
a
formal
order
even
when
a
formal
order
was
requested.
in
any
cases,
disability
is
relatively
short
term.
disability
may
last
be
total
but
short
time,
say
two
months
of
time
lost
from
the
job.
during
those
two
months,
the
employer
is
required
to
pay
compensation
benefits.
it
may
be
that
the
deputy
commissioner
would
not
have
time
to
enter
a
formal
order
until
six
months
later
so
that
compensation
had
terminated
prior
to
the
entry
of
a
formal
award.
in
1927
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
if
the
award
were
actually
entered,
the
only
provision
in
the
statute
that
would
allow
for
any
action
was
section
22
which
said
that
you
could
modify
an
award.
there
was
no
provision
for
a
new
initial
consideration.
there
was
no
provision
for
a
new
initial
claim.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that
was
in
the
original
version,
in
1927.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
during
the
term
of
the
award
and
after
it
has
become
final
so
that
if
the
payment
of
compensation
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
the
term
had
already
ended.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
and
it
was
no
longer
possible
to
review
it.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
right.
now,
the
act
was
amended
in
1934
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
no,
that
was
in
1938.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
in
1934,
it
was
amended
to
expand
the
time
for
review.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
to
one
year
but
it
used
the
same
time
for
compensation
of
that
year
that
it
had
previously,
that
is
the
date
of
last
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
--
payment
of
compensation
that's
on
page
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
page
3
of
our
brief
still
contains
the
operative
language.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
right,
as
amended
in
34,
its
on
page
21
of
our
brief.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
in
our
view,
we
have
devoted
our
entire
brief
to
explaining
why
strachan
shipping
was
incorrect.
it
simply
misread
the
1934
revision
and
the
1927
history
of
this
act
and
strachan
shipping
also
operated
under
a
misapprehension
of
the
available
relief
to
an
employer
or
its
insurer.
strachan
shipping
assumed
that
if
after
one
year
the
claim
did
not
come
to
rest,
there
was
no
way
it
could
be
put
to
rest.
that's
simply
incorrect
under
the
statute.
the
fifth
circuit
itself
had
earlier
held
in
the
donovan
case
that
under
section
19
(c)
of
the
act,
the
employer
can
demand
an
adjudication
and
receive
a
compensation
order
at
any
time.
it's
also
true
now
that
under
section
8
(i)
of
the
amended
act,
the
employer
and
the
employee
can
settle
claim
and
with
the
approval
of
the
deputy
commissioner,
the
case
will
come
to
rest.
there
are
other
devices
available
to
terminate
a
claim.
many
claims
expire
because
the
disability
has
completely
ended.
so
it's
not
true
as
was
the
operative
assumption
in
strachan
shipping
that
these
cases
will
linger
forever
unless
they
are
automatically
terminated
after
one
year.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
pardon?
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
this
claim
has
now
been
adjudicated
and
the
deputy
commissioner
has
handed
an
order.
assume
it
hadn't
been
filed,
i
mean,
could
he
file
in
20
years
from
now?
this
one,
this
one.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
we
discussed
in
our
brief
the
possibility
that
if
the
employer
or
his
insurer
could
show
actual
prejudice
from
the
lingering
of
the
claim
that
the
size
of
an
award
might
me
diminished
because
of
that
prejudice.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
it's
a
doctrine
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
--
very
similar
to
the
doctrine
of
latches
your
honor
in
equitable
actions
in
which
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
put
any
limitation.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
there
would
be
no
formal
limitation.
it's
very
similar
to
the
case
in
which
you
filed
a
civil
action
in
a
federal
district
court
within
the
statute
of
limitations.
that
case
might
linger
on
the
doctrine
of
the
district
court
for
a
very
large
number
of
years
before
it
comes
to
adjudication.
if
as
a
result
of
informal
conferences
in
the
chambers
of
the
judge,
formal
adjudication
is
postponed
pursuant
to
a
--
looks
like
it
may
be
a
settlement.
that
case
is
alive
and
will
stay
there
for
years
if
necessary.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
pardon?
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
it
has
however
been
very
similar
to
that.
a
formal
claim
was
filed
within
a
month
of
the
accident.
that's
very
similar
your
honor
to
filing
a
suit
in
a
district
court.
that's
what
meets
the
statute
of
limitations
for
the
act,
the
one
year
statute
of
limitations.
a
claim
was
filed
in
the
office
of
the
deputy
commissioner
seeking
adjudication.
it
was
not
then
adjudicated
but
the
opportunity
of
adjudication
created
by
that
claim
lingered
on
we
submit
and
could
not
be
terminated
except
by
an
adjudication
of
that
claim.
justice
has
sued
and
the
federal
district
court
cannot
be
terminated
except
by
an
adjudication
of
that
claim
by
a
dismissal,
by
an
order
or
by
anything
else
of
that
major.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
yes
and
it
might
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
under
section
14
(h)
(2)
i
believe
is
the
number.
the
deputy
commissioner
has
the
power
on
his
own
initiative
to
enter
a
compensation
case
in
order
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
parties.
that
section
permits
the
deputy
commissioner
to
enter
a
compensation
order
that
would
dismiss
or
otherwise
terminate
the
claim
for
compensation
and
we
submit
that's
identical
to
the
district
court's
power
to
dismiss
for
one
prosecution.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
just
--
just
as
it
would
be
if
he
filed
in
the
district
court
but
at
the
same
time,
the
important
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
not
another
claim
your
honor.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
you
seek
for
adjudication
of
the
claim.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
the
district
court
will
often
dismiss
for
one
prosecution.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
there
will
be
no
point
in
seeking
out
follow-up.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
it
doesn't
happen
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
right.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
as
it
could
have
been
done
here
if
the
employer
had
sought
a
formal
order
based
on
its
desire
to
pay
a
specified
amount
of
money
and
he
could
have
sought
such
an
order
from
the
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
yes,
and
under
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
the
deputy
commissioner
has
the
power
to
do
that.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
correct
and
we're
also
relying
on
the
fact
the
employer
could
have
sought
action
if
he
wanted
but
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
other
highly
salient
difference
between
this
and
an
ordinary
toward
claim.
the
evidence
in
a
compensation
action
is
uniquely
persevering.
in
a
tort
action
for
example,
the
nature
of
the
question
is
what
happened
on
the
day
of
the
injury?
who
saw
this
man
being
knocked
off
a
beam
and
fall
on
the
ground?
who
is
responsible
for
it?
what
happened
back
in
1960?
that's
simply
not
the
question
in
this
case
because
this
is
a
no
fault
statute.
the
evidence
that
bears
on
a
compensation
claim
is
evidence
that
is
available
at
any
time
even
long
after
the
injury.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
right.
the
injury
has
to
occur
and
arise
out
of
business.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
and
there's
no
question
of
that
here.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
correct.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
mr.
jones
was
in
fact
disabled.
the
evidence
that
bears
on
that
disability
is
available
now
by
examining
mr.
jones.
if
in
fact
he's
totally
disabled,
that
evidence
can
be
had
by
an
examination
today.
it
wasn't
lost
and
forgotten
from
something
that
happened
15
years
ago.
if
he
is
in
fact
only
partially
disabled,
that
evidence
is
available
today
too,
examinations
can
be
held
today.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
unless
there
has
been
an
accident
in
the
interim
and
there
is
a
question
of
allotee.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
the
causality
question
is
very
interesting
because
that
often
is
the
subject
of
separate
motions
for
additional
compensation
before
the
deputy
commissioner
and
the
evidence
that
would
be
pertinent
to
that
is
not
either
preserved
or
dissolved
because
of
the
application
to
review
this
compensation
case.
if
it
wasn't
available,
it
would
not
be
available
if
this
application
had
been
filed
sooner
in
order
to
become
less
available
if
the
application
is
postponed.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
we're
not
sure
that
it
seems
to
read
that
way.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
there
are
several
things
that
might
happen
to
claimants
on
situations
of
this
sort.
probably
the
most
important
of
them
is
that
if
section
22
is
applicable
to
every
case
in
which
compensation
has
been
paid
without
an
award,
then
a
large
number
of
claimants
will
have
their
benefits
terminated
completely
against
their
will
even
if
they
file
an
application
on
the
very
day
those
benefits
were
terminated.
they
can
never
resurrect
them
and
there's
a
very
interesting
reason
why.
section
22
gives
two
reasons
to
file
an
application
under
that
section.
the
first
reason
is
a
mistake
of
fact
by
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
second
reason
is
a
change
in
conditions.
if
there
has
been
no
compensation
order,
there
can
have
been
no
mistake
of
fact
by
the
deputy
commissioner.
if
the
claimant
has
to
allege
that
there
has
been
a
change
of
circumstances,
the
question
then
is
change
since
when?
change
since
the
deputy
commissioner
entered
his
order?
no,
there
has
been
no
order.
change
since
the
time
of
the
accident?
why
should
there
have
been
a
change
in
circumstances
since
the
time
of
the
accident
to
entitle
someone
to
benefits?
jones,
the
claimant
in
this
case
claimed
that
he
was
permanently
and
totally
disabled
from
the
date
of
the
accident
and
that
there
has
been
no
change
in
his
circumstances.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
the
employer
claimed
that
there
was
temporary
total.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
he
accepted
those
payments
although
he
claim
--
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
and
still
claims
that
he
was
permanent.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
right,
and
there
was
a
informal
conference
held.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
no,
he
could
not
claim
that
your
honor.
he
claimed
as
early
as
1966,
two
years
before
the
payments
were
stopped
that
he
was
permanently
disabled
and
he
has
in
fact
claimed
that
since
he
filed
in
his
initial
claim.
he
has
never
asserted
that
there
has
been
a
change
in
circumstances.
he
has
asserted
that
he
was
disabled
from
the
very
beginning
and
that
there
is
no
relevant
change.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
the
only
way
we
could
read
change
in
circumstances
in
that
way
justice
stewart
would
be
to
say
that
the
change
in
circumstance
is
a
change
in
the
positions
of
the
party
rather
than
a
change
in
the
physical
conditions.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
right.
it's
a
change
in
circumstance
that
could
arise
whenever
anybody
said
so
and
which
then
would
be
the
equivalents
of
saying
you
file
an
application
under
section
22
whenever
you
want
to
because
you
would
assert
that
i
now
feel
that
i'm
entitled
to
something
else
but
it
doesn't
say
that.
i
think
it
requires
some
objective
change
of
circumstance
and
simply
your
assertion
that
you
believe
something
different
or
want
to
assert
something
different.
but
in
any
case,
the
change
of
circumstance
that
he
would
assert
is
not
his
own
change
of
position.
would
be
somewhat
anomalous
for
the
claimant
to
assert
that
the
employer
and
let
me
take
that
back
too
because
the
employer
hasn't
change
his
position
either.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
we
think
that
it
would
probably
be
more
consistent
with
the
history
of
this
act
to
read
change
in
conditions
as
change
in
the
condition
of
the
employee.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
we
have
interpreted
it
that
way
in
the
past.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
we
think
that's
highly
important
that
the
--
all
that
gives
the
deputy
commissioner
a
power
to
do
is
under
a
new
compensation
order
and
if
there
has
been
no
old
compensation
order,
we
don't
understand
that
new
compensation
order
could
have
any
meaning
and
as
i
also
suggested
to
justice
stewart,
the
language
in
the
act
providing
for
the
reasons
for
review
under
section
22
has
the
same
import.
a
mistake
of
fact
by
the
deputy
commissioner
can't
have
occurred
unless
there
was
a
previous
compensation
order
and
we
think
that
the
better
reading
of
section
22
is
that
a
change
of
circumstances
refers
to
a
change
of
circumstances
since
a
compensation
order
was
issued.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
i
think
so
but
our
position
to
summarize
it
once
more
is
that
that
language
one
year
after
the
date
of
last
compensation
whether
or
not
an
order
has
been
issued
simply
fixes
the
time
from
which
the
year
begins
to
run
and
it
does
not
establish
for
whom
the
year
runs.
so
that
in
many
cases
where
an
order
is
entered
after
the
last
payment
of
compensation,
the
year
begins
to
run
before
the
order
is
entered
and
that
maybe
that
the
year
sometimes
expires
before
the
order
is
entered.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
so
that
an
application
for
review
or
a
resurrection
of
the
claim
if
you
will
could
be
made
at
some
later
date?
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
n
most
of
those
cases
your
honor,
payments
for
compensation
are
no
longer
due
because
there's
no
longer
any
disability
attributable
to
the
act.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
and
in
the
vast
majority
of
those
cases,
no
section
13
(a)
was
ever
filed
so
that
within
a
year
after
the
injury,
or
within
a
year
after
the
last
payment
of
compensation
in
cases
in
which
no
formal
claim
was
filed
that
expires.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
we
estimate
that
several
hundred
a
year
are
in
a
position
similar
to
john's.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
for
each
of
past
years
as
well.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
that's
correct.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
there
maybe
a
large
number
or
small
number.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
we
can't
tell
with
certainty.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
he
can
indeed,
although
it's
not
in
the
nature
of
an
amendment.
claims
are
construed
rather
liberally
under
this
act
and
the
duty
to
pay
compensation
does
not
depend
technically
upon
what
is
pleaded
in
a
claim
but
on
the
actual
extend
of
disability.
the
function
of
the
claim
is
to
notify
the
employer
that
compensation
will
be
demanded
formally
if
it's
not
forthcoming
otherwise
and
to
otherwise
avail
himself
of
his
right
to
an
adjudication
and
it
is
exactly
that
right
to
an
adjudication
that
has
dissipated
in
this
case.
if
because
compensation
has
terminated,
the
employer
can
no
longer
receive
it.
mr.
frank
h.easterbrook
we
believe
it
would.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
if
the
employer's
disposition
is
adopted,
it
will
create
an
interesting
incentive
to
terminate
payments
of
compensation
without
an
award.
the
employer
will
be
able
to
terminate
the
compensation
and
if
the
employee
does
not
protest
within
a
year,
even
meritorious
claims
are
extinguished,
so
we
think
it's
an
incentive
disease
paying
compensation.
thank
you
very
much.
