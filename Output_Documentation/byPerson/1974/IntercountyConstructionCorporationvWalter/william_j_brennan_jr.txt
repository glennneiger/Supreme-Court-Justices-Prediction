change
of
what
date
did
you
say
it
was
barred.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
would
be
a
year
after
the
carrier
stopped
making
payments?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anywhere
in
the
briefs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can't
the
carrier
always
protect
itself
by
having
the
--
having
an
order
entered
or
having
an
award
entered
if
you
--
if
the
carrier
starts
to
pay
voluntarily
after
a
claim
is
filed
which
happens
which
happens
i
suppose
most
of
the
time.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is
additional
paper
work,
isn't
it?
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
not
--
the
united
state
is
against
you,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
you're
suggesting
--
what
you
are
suggesting
is
that
rather
they
never
start
voluntarily,
you're
just
going
to
wait
till
there's
an
order
entered.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
would
be
--
it
would
be
--
you
would
be
protected
after
a
certain
length
of
time
after
you
made
the
last
payment
required
by
the
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
that
recommendation,
even
though
accepted
by
the
carrier
is
not
an
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
yes.
