this
section
22
on
page
33
of
the
appendix
was
proposed
but
never
enacted,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
--
the
original
claim
must
be
filed
within
a
year
after
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
i
guess
is
common
ground
between
you
and
your
adversary.
justice
potter
stewart
19
(a)
in
the
briefs
here.
justice
potter
stewart
what
you
are
talking
about
is
whether
or
not
a
compensation
order
has
been
issued?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
critical
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
the
deputy
commissioner,
you
had
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
voluntary
payment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
understand
my
brother
rehnquist's
question
is
how
can
you
have
a
modification
of
an
award
when
there
hasn't
been
any
award?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
thought
on
the
contrary
that
you
were
relying
very
very
heavily
on
the
subtitle
of
section
22
modification
of
awards
to
give
--
to
explain
the
meaning
of
the
language
and
yet
the
title
of
--
is
simply
is
inapplicable
for
the
reason
suggested
by
my
brother
rehnquist
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
about
in
the
original
statute
in
1927?
justice
potter
stewart
they
modified
an
award
and
what
was
the
time
limitation?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
point
is
it
opted
by
the
time
the
award
came,
the
term
expired.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
that
was
the
original
statute
in
1927?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
--
and
no
review
of
a
rejection
claim?
justice
potter
stewart
you
allow
review
of
a
rejection?
justice
potter
stewart
oh.
justice
potter
stewart
for
one
year?
justice
potter
stewart
where
would
you
find
that
line?
justice
potter
stewart
i
had
that
line
a
while
ago
but
it
just
somewhat
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
but
this
is
a
present
one,
you're
talking
about
the
34
about
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
to
putting
that
any
such
limitation
on
that?
justice
potter
stewart
as
you
read
the
statute
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
all
statute,
the
result
suggested
by
my
brother
marshall's
question
would
prevail,
i.e.
would
be
no
limitation
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
well
yeah,
but
the
analogy
really
here,
when
a
complaint
is
filed
in
the
district
court
and
then
the
defendant
voluntarily
begins
giving
it
a
relief
you
asked
for
in
the
complaint
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
analog
--
there's
no
analog
between
that
situation
and
this,
is
there?
because
that
just
didn't
happen.
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
latest
filed
on
the
district
court,
generally,
the
defendant
doesn't
voluntarily
begin
given
the
relief
that
the
plaintiff
wants
to
the
plaintiff.
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
is
any
such
thing
as
3906,
it's
wrapped
in
a
settlement
and
the
lawsuit
is
dismissed.
justice
potter
stewart
to
arise
out
of
the
employment,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
the
carrier
wouldn't
have
begun
paying
unless
he
had
agreed
it
had
or
had
not
in
this
point.
justice
potter
stewart
what's
4107
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
easterbrook,
what
would
be
the
undo
hardship
on
claimants
if
one
way
to
read
the
language
of
section
22,
the
way
it
seems
to
read
and
the
way
your
brother
says
we
ought
to
read
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
or
the
way
your
brother
says
we
ought
to
read
it.
justice
potter
stewart
did
you
ever
think
that
the
payments
were
made
on
the
basis
of
temporary
total,
weren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
was
the
basis
on
which
the
voluntary
payments
were
made
and
he
accepted
those
payments?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
then
now
he
comes
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
payment
stopped,
the
carrier
stopped
him.
first,
i
guess
cut
him
in
half
and
then
stopped
him,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
certainly,
he
knew
when
they
were
reduced
by
half
and
he
certainly
knew
when
the
payment
stopped.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
had
a
year
then
to
say
the
change
in
condition
is
that
i'm
not
permanently
and
totally
disabled.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
think
it's
a
little
perhaps
easier
to
read
the
change
in
circumstances
language
generously
than
maybe
to
read
the
critical
clause
and
this
is
the
annotation.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
not
an
anomaly
tortured
meaning.
justice
potter
stewart
one
change
in
the
condition
--
it
says
on
the
ground
of
a
change
in
conditions,
don't
say
assert
has
said.
now,
one
very
objectively
measurable
change
in
conditions
is
that
the
carrier
stopped
paying?
justice
potter
stewart
no
one
ties
you
up
to
that
case,
this
case
goes
against
you,
do
you?
