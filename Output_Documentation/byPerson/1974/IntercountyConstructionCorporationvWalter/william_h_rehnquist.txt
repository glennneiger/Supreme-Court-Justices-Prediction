justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
this
case
had
come
up
before
the
1934
amendment,
how
would
it
have
come
out
with
section
22
reading
as
it
did
before
congress
amended
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
would
have
a
claim
filed
and
no
award
ever
made,
wouldn't
he
have
the
power
to
make
the
award
prior
to
1934?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
what
--
what
is
it
about
the
act
before
1934
that
prevents
the
deputy
commissioner
from
acting
after
the
expiration
of
a
year
from
the
payment
of
the
last
compensation
if
a
claim
was
timely
filed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
you
have
a
modification
of
the
award
which
is
i
guess
the
subtitle
of
section
22
whether
or
not
a
pay
--
whether
or
not
a
compensation
order
has
been
issued?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
can
see
that
in
connection
with
the
payment
of
compensation
but
in
section
22,
you
have
a
title
that
says
modification
of
award.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
suggesting
that
everything
you're
talking
about
there
is
dealing
with
the
modification
of
an
award
previously
made
and
then
you
have
this
clause
that
both
of
you
regard
as
critical
in
the
middle
of
that
thing
that
says
whether
or
not
a
compensation
order
has
been
issued.
is
a
compensation
order
the
same
thing
as
an
award?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
wait
a
minute.
you
said
compensation
terminated
prior
to
an
award?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
possibility
of
reviewing
the
awards?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
there
hadn't
been
any
award,
why
would
there
be
the
review?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
wouldn't
be
reviewing
an
award
if
you
look
at
something
after
that,
you
would
be
either
giving
an
initial
award
or
adjudicating
to
his
but
at
least
you
wouldn't
be
reviewing
an
award.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
easterbrook,
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
taking
a
look
at
section
22
as
it
appears
on
page
3
of
your
brief,
the
language
in
about
the
8th
line
on
the
bottom
page
issue
a
new
compensation
order.
from
the
government's
point
of
view,
isn't
it
perhaps
a
better
argument
to
say
that
that's
the
critical
language
rather
than
concentrating
on
this
whether
or
not
a
compensation
order
has
been
issued
and
say
that
the
jones
here
didn't
ask
for
the
issue
of
a
new
compensation
order
and
that's
all
that
section
22
applies
to?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
section
13
of
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
act
requires
the
filing
of
a
claim
under
the
act
within
one
year
of
injury.
the
only
question
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
another
section
of
the
same
act
bars
consideration
of
a
claim
which
has
been
timely
filed
under
section
13
but
which
has
not
been
the
subject
of
an
order
or
award
by
the
officials
charged
with
administration
of
the
act
within
one
year
after
the
cessation
of
voluntary
compensation
payments.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
whose
judgment
we
review
here
held
that
section
22,
the
other
section
of
the
act
didn't
impose
any
bar.
we
agree.
while
section
22
on
its
face
is
ambiguous,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
intended
the
one
year
time
limit
contained
in
22
to
apply
only
to
the
power
to
modify
previously
entered
orders
and
not
to
the
initial
entry
of
orders
on
claims
timely
filed
under
section
13.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
affirmed.
