mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
today
arises
under
the
longshoreman's
and
harbor
worker's
compensation
act
and
involves
a
construction
of
section
22
of
that
act
which
deals
with
time
limitations
provisions.
the
act
as
it
now
exist
in
section
22
provides
basically
that
upon
its
own
initiative
or
upon
an
application
of
any
party
in
interest
on
the
ground
of
a
change
in
conditions
or
a
determination
of
a
mistake,
in
fact
by
the
deputy
commissioner,
the
deputy
commissioner
may
at
any
time
prior
to
one
year
after
the
date
of
last
payment
of
compensation
whether
or
not
a
compensation
word
has
been
issued,
review
a
compensation
case.
the
facts
briefly
are
that
charles
jones
was
injured
while
working
for
intercounty
construction
in
july
of
1960.
he
filed
a
written
claim
for
compensation
benefits
in
august
of
1960.
the
insurance
carrier
voluntarily
paid
compensation
without
an
award
for
a
period
extending
into
january
of
1965.
at
that
point,
the
carrier
filed
a
notice
indicating
that
the
claim
would
be
controverted
and
it
then
reduced
his
benefits
by
50%.
an
informal
conference
was
held
before
a
claims
examiner
and
the
matter
was
adjourned
without
any
resolution
of
the
claim
of
mr.
jones.
in
january
of
1968,
the
carrier
stopped
making
compensation
payments
at
all
because
the
statutory
limit
of
$17,280
had
been
reached
except
for
death
cases
and
permanent
total
disability.
more
than
two
years
later,
mr.
jones'
attorney
requested
a
hearing
on
his
claim
for
permanent
and
total
disability
and
it
is
the
carrier's
position
that
by
having
let
that
time
run,
the
claim
is
not
barred.
principal
reluc
--
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
we
would
say
mr.
justice
brennan
that
as
of
january
1969,
i
believe
the
date
would
be
the
23rd.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
yes
your
honor.
now,
we
rely
principally
on
the
strachan
shipping
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
cert
was
denied
by
those
court
in
1972.
it
appears
phonetically
as
strachan
and
i
believe
the
pronunciation
is
strachan.
in
any
event,
that
case
considering
the
identical
issue
came
to
the
conclusion
that
by
statutory
setup
and
these
regulations
implementing
it,
congress
had
events
an
intention
that
that
compensation
payments
were
to
be
made
voluntarily
by
the
carrier
and
once
payments
had
stopped,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
claimant
to
file
a
further
claim
if
he
sought
additional
benefits.
now,
it
might
seem
at
first
forced
that
the
filing
of
additional
claims
would
be
an
owner's
burden,
however,
there
are
numerous
cases
which
have
held
that
simple
things
such
as
a
telephone
call
to
a
deputy
commissioner
or
a
claims
examiner
or
a
claimant
complained
that
the
carrier
had
stopped
benefits
and
a
memorandum
was
then
placed
in
the
file
were
sufficient
to
constitute
a
claim.
there
are
cases
from
the
benefit's
review
board
for
example
which
have
even
held
that
the
filing
of
an
attending
physician's
report
is
sufficient
to
constitute
the
filing
of
a
claim
so
that
we
do
not
believe
that
the
its
unreasonable
to
require
a
claimant
to
pursue
his
claim
with
some
degree
of
due
diligence.
we
have
cited
in
our
petitioner
for
certiorari
at
least
three
other
decisions,
two
of
which
are
unreported
which
reflect
basically
the
long
standing
way
the
act
has
been
applied.
we
have
the
1942
case
in
the
district
of
columbia,
the
mcfadden
decision.
we
have
the
okiff
decision
decided
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
1962
and
we
have
just
recently
had
a
decision
by
an
administrative
law
judge
under
the
amended
act
all
holding
that
if
more
than
one
year
runs
after
the
date
of
last
compensation
payment,
whether
or
not
a
compensation
order
has
been
issued,
the
claim
is
barred.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
disagreed
and
rejected
the
holding
and
struck
them.
they
came
to
the
conclusion
first
of
all
that
section
22
was
ambiguous
and
then
they
said
it
was
necessary
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
behind
section
and
that
interpretation
suggested
that
section
22
was
only
suppose
to
apply
when
the
deputy
commissioner
had
issued
an
actual
compensation
order
rather
than
a
situation
where
a
claim
had
been
filed,
had
never
been
acted
on
and
the
time
had
merely
run
subsequent
there
too.
we
believe
that
the
legislative
history
is
capable
of
more
than
one
interpretation
and
we
suggest
that
the
court
of
appeals
respectfully
was
in
error.
i
believe
that
is
useful
to
go
to
the
legislative
history
as
it
existed
in
1927.
this
is
found
at
page
16
and
17
of
the
government's
brief.
after
the
act
was
initially
enacted,
the
u.s.
employees
compensation
commission
which
was
charged
with
overseeing
the
act
complained
that
there
were
difficulties
arising
because
by
the
time
the
award
had
seized,
the
deputy
commissioner
no
longer
had
any
power
to
do
anything
about
it.
the
man
would
get
his
money
and
the
deputy
commissioner
couldn't
change
it
even
if
there
were
some
reason
why
he
should
change
it
and
therefore,
they
suggested
that
there
should
be
some
amendments.
now,
in
appendix
reference
33,
we
find
and
this
is
taken
from
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion.
we
find
the
proposed
recommendations
of
the
u.s.
employees
commission.
now,
you
will
note
that
they
are
limiting
this
situation
strictly
to
a
situation
where
a
deputy
commissioner
is
reviewing
a
compensation
order.
they
are
not
limiting
it
with
any
time
framework
at
all
so
that
what
they
have
proposed
in
effect
is
the
deputy
commissioner
without
regard
to
any
time
limitation
may
review
a
compensation
order
and
he
may
issue
a
new
compensation
order
or
may
make
a
change
by
virtue
of
a
compensation
order.
all
of
these
of
course
requiring
an
action
by
the
deputy
commissioner
with
respect
to
a
formal
adjudicatory
compensation
order.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
yes
mr.
justice
stewart,
that's
correct,
and
i
think
it
is
significant
because
we
then
go
to
section
22
as
it
was
actually
enacted
which
would
be
found
at
page
21
of
the
government's
brief
and
i
think
if
we
compare
what
was
done
with
what
was
proposed,
we
see
that
there
are
significant
differences.
first
of
all,
they
indicate
that
the
deputy
commissioner
may
at
any
time
prior
to
one
year
after
the
date
of
last
payment
of
compensation
that
was
not
in
the
proposal
from
the
u.s.
compensation
commission.
it
also
indicates
that
he
may
review
a
compensation
case
as
oppose
to
review
a
compensation
order.
so,
we
feel
it
is
very
significant
that
what
was
enacted
was
not
what
was
proposed
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
house
and
the
senate
reports
for
the
1934
amendments
indicate
that
the
eventual
enactments
of
1934
were
as
a
results
of
meetings
and
compromises
between
the
employee's
unions
and
the
employer's
ship
building
organizations.
so
that
we
do
not
have
a
situation
where
the
u.s.
employees
commission
makes
recommendations,
these
are
immediately
adopted
by
congress
and
then
we
take
off
from
there.
we
have
a
meeting
between
the
interested
parties.
we
have
a
compromised.
we
then
have
an
enactment
which
is
not
at
all
similar
to
what
was
proposed
by
the
u.s.
employees
commission.
now,
i
also
think
that
it
is
helpful
to
look
at
some
of
the
testimony
and
some
of
the
legislative
history
after
1934
because
in
1938,
we
had
another
amendment
to
section
22.
now,
the
problem
that
arose
after
the
34th
amendment
was
simply
this.
there
was
no
provision
with
regard
to
a
situation
where
a
deputy
commissioner
had
rejected
a
claim
for
him
to
review
it
again
and
so
amendments
were
proposed
which
were
eventually
enacted
in
1938,
which
would
allow
a
deputy
commissioner
even
after
he
had
rejected
a
claim
within
one
year
to
review
the
situation
to
see
if
he
had
made
a
mistake
of
fact
or
if
there
had
been
a
changed
in
condition.
now,
on
july
31st
1935
and
this
is
house
subcommittee
number
3
on
house
report
8293,
74th
congress
first
session,
which
is
also
in
reference
generally
in
the
government's
brief.
we
have
testimony
from
louis
dolby
who
is
general
counsel
for
the
u.s.
employees
commission.
at
page
14
of
the
house
subcommittee
report,
we
have
the
following
discussion
about
these
proposed
amendments.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
it's
referred
to
your
honor
but
it
is
not
reproduced.
mr.
dolby
indicates
section
refers
to
the
amendment
made
last
year
involving
section
22
of
the
longshoreman's
act.
he
is
then
asked
by
mr.
emmanuel
seller,
"where
does
that
limitation
appear
in
the
original
act?"
"mr.
dolby:
that
is
in
section
5
of
the
mandatory
act
of
may
26,
1934
amending
section
22
of
the
original
act."
it
was
amended
last
year
so
as
to
provide
for
a
reopening
by
the
deputy
commissioner
within
a
year
after
the
last
payment
of
compensation.
now,
the
government's
position
is
that
the
deputy
commissioner
has
to
issue
a
formal
compensation
order.
our
position
is
that
regardless
of
whether
a
compensation
order
is
issued
or
not,
the
time
begins
to
run
within
one
year
from
the
date
of
last
compensation
payment.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
i
don't
believe
there
would
have
been
any
power
in
the
deputy
commissioner
to
do
anything
because
we
did
not
have
the
time
situation
involved.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
oh
yes,
i
misunderstood.
yes
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
what
would
happen
is
that
we
have
had
the
same
situation
except
that
we
would
eventually
have
had
the
sealing
of
$7500.00
which
was
at
applicable
maximum
then
as
i
understand
it
reached
and
then
the
deputy
commissioner
would
have
had
the
power
to
act
on
the
claim
if
the
man
had
done
something
within
a
year.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
well,
my
recollection
is
that
as
long
as
money
was
continuing
to
be
paid,
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
him
to
act
but
if
the
man
said
in
effect
that
the
carrier
had
arbitrarily
cut
me
back
50%,
then
he
would
have
had
the
power
to
go
ahead
and
act.
now,
as
long
as
the
money
is
continuing
to
be
paid
to
the
man,
he
can
either
make
a
request
for
a
formal
hearing
because
the
amount
he
is
receiving
is
inadequate
or
he
can
sit
back
and
be
satisfied
with
it.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
it
does.
well,
i
think
that
that
sounds
good
theoretically.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
not
for
the
carrier.
the
carrier
as
long
it
gets
protected
consistent
with
what
the
man's
rights
are,
the
carrier
is
not
concerned
about
the
additional
paper
work
but
the
deputy
commissioner
is,
i
can
assure
you
that.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
well,
i
think
that
they
are
looking
at
the
statute
from
the
standpoint
of
how
they
interpret
it
rather
than
how
the
deputy
commissioners
perhaps
actually
administer
it.
you'll
notice
in
this
case
for
example,
the
deputy
commissioner
actually
rejected
the
claim
the
first
time
around.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
well,
this
is
correct.
in
other
words,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
act
is
the
man
gets
hurt,
if
you
have
no
issue
with
respect
to
his
wages
or
his
arising
out
in
the
course
of
the
employment,
then
you
start
making
payments
and
if
you
have
a
situation
where
eventually
you
cut
the
man
back,
there
is
perhaps
a
dispute
lets
say
on
a
rating
for
a
leg
or
if
you
have
a
lost
of
wager
and
incapacity
dispute
and
the
man
can
go
all
the
way
back
to
day
one
and
get
full
benefits,
wouldn't
sent
off
his
heir
for
the
carrier
to
comply
with
voluntary
provisions
of
the
act.
they
will
always
insist
on
a
formal
order
so
that
they
will
be
protected
in
the
event
more
than
one
year
runs
after
the
compensation
order
was
entered.
this
is
completely
contrary
to
the
way
the
act
is
administered.
the
informal
conferences
for
example,
we
have
statistics
in
our
brief
--
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
yes,
right.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
but
that
is
the
only
--
the
only
protection,
otherwise,
the
claim
can
be
resurrected
at
any
time.
the
government's
position
is
that
if
a
man
files
his
claim
within
one
year
and
the
carrier
keeps
on
making
payments
and
eventually
at
some
point
in
time,
the
man
becomes
dissatisfied
with
the
rate
at
which
he's
paid
and
the
man
simply
has
to
say
i
want
a
hearing
and
he
can
go
back
to
day
one
and
then
run
this
out
for
x
number
of
years
and
we
think
that
this
is
not
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
act.
the
way
--
the
way
the
whole
scheme
of
the
act
works
very
simply
is
this.
if
there
is
an
issue
which
is
controverted,
the
parties
go
to
what
is
called
an
informal
conferences,
is
called
any
regulations
of
pre-hearing
time,
specifically
is
called
an
informal
conference.
the
claimant
is
there.
if
he
is
represented,
his
attorney
is
there
and
the
carrier
is
there.
usually
the
carriers
do
not
have
attorneys
present
although
i
have
been
there
in
many
instances.
the
claims
examiners
will
say,
“mr.
so
and
so,
what
is
your
claim?”
the
man
will
say,
“i'm
claiming
temporary
total
disability
for
x
number
of
days.”
the
claims
examiner
then
goes
down
all
the
various
issues,
“are
you
contesting
jurisdiction,
statute
limitations,
wages,
all
this
sort
of
things?”
he
then
says
to
the
carrier,
“what
is
your
position?"
the
carrier
will
then
narrow
the
issues.
typically,
what
happens
as
in
this
strachan
shipping
case,
a
recommendation
is
issued
and
this
is
set
out
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
the
carrier.
it
is
hereby
recommended
that
you
do
this
and
you
do
that.
either
party
is
given
the
right
to
accept
or
reject
that
recommendation.
typically,
if
there
is
really
no
dispute,
the
carrier
will
sign
it
as
being
accepted
which
is
provided
in
the
form
and
return
it
to
the
bureau
and
this
is
the
way
things
are
typically
handled
and
i
think
the
statistic
show
that
formal
hearings
are
definitely
abnormal
and
informal
adjudications
which
are
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
the
act,
other
way,
this
things
are
handled.
now,
--
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
it
is
not.
it
is
simply
a
letter,
it
is
not
sent
out
in
conformity
with
section
19
where
it
required
to
send
out
notice
by
registered
mail
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
it's
simply
a
letter
saying
that
we'd
had
informal
conference
and
based
on
the
development
at
the
conference,
this
is
what
we
recommend
and
then
they
have
a
place
where
it
says
you
are
expected
to
accept
or
reject
this
within
14
days.
if
you
accept
it
please
sign
it
and
return
it
to
the
bureau
and
that's
the
way
the
whole
act
works
but
the
government
is
now
coming
in
and
saying,
“no,
this
isn't
the
way
it
suppose
to
work.”
in
every
case,
you
are
to
insist
on
an
order
if
you
want
the
provisions
of
section
22
to
apply
and
we
that
this
is
terribly
an
equitable
in
typical
case
there
is
dealt
it
with
at
the
bureau.
i
think
that
--
that
we
must
if
i
may
just
go
back
one
second.
we
also
have
to
look
at
how
practical
it
is,
the
government's
brief
for
example
suggest,
well,
you
can
always
if
you
want
to
protect
yourself
other
than
or
you
can
always
get
the
matter
settled.
well,
at
the
time
of
this
act
--
accident,
the
only
provision
for
a
settlement
was
approved
by
the
secretary
of
labor
and
i
can
assure
you
that
to
my
knowledge,
there
has
only
been
one
or
two
settlements
ever
approved
by
the
secretary
of
labor.
so
that
is
a
very
impractical
suggestion.
now,
i
think
we
must
get
back
again
to
what
happens
if
this
position
of
the
labor
department
is
adopted.
let's
assume
that
a
claim
is
filed
within
the
first
year
and
the
carrier
pays
without
an
award
and
nothing
further
is
done.
this
claim
under
their
position
can
be
resurrected
at
any
time
in
the
future
and
the
strachan
shipping
case
for
example,
there
was
12
years
that
run
between
the
date
of
last
compensation
and
when
the
claim
was
actually
prosecuted.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
suppose
we
have
a
situation
where
again
the
claim
is
filed
within
a
year
and
the
carrier
pays
without
an
award
and
we
reached
a
statutory
maximum
of
in
this
case
$17,280.00
and
there
has
been
no
adjudication
by
the
deputy
commissioner
and
then
we
have
more
than
a
year
run.
are
we
to
say
that
the
man's
claim
is
still
open,
it
is
still
not
time
barred
by
provisions
of
the
act?
we
feel
that
the
government's
position
is
becoming
very
technical
and
is
completely
contrary
to
the
way
this
act
is
administered.
and
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
additional
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
c.duncan
iii
nothing
further
mr.
chief
justice.
