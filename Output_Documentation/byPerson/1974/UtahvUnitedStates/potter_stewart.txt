before
you
do
mr.
boggs
and
may
be
you
have
answered
this
--
these
concepts
of
accretion
and
reliction
and
on
the
other
hand
the
revulsion
are
well
known
of
course
to
the
law
of
rivers
where
the
river
is
a
boundary
or
either
state
boundary
or
boundary
of
somebody’s
property
in
prior
property
disputes.
are
there
any
cases
until
this
one
involving
lakes?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
hasn’t
that
always
been
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
bonelli
case
involved
--
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
federal
cases
involving
a
lake?
any
great
lake
cases
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
remember
against
washington
involving
the
pacific
ocean.
justice
potter
stewart
the
petitioner
has
a
video
to
deal
with
it,
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
may
i
ask
about
the
exhibit
6?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
much
of
the
land
in
dispute
is
now
under
water?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now,
what
are
those
pictures
--
those
i
think
you
said
to
us,
show
some
that
is
not
--
some
exposed
lands
in
dispute.
justice
potter
stewart
exposed
lands?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
hearing
was
when.
justice
potter
stewart
and
were
they
still
exposed
in
1973?
justice
potter
stewart
then
looking
at
these
we’re
not
looking
at
the
situation
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
consequence
of
that
as
to
the
lands
in
dispute
being
under
water
is
more
than
ever
around
the
world,
is
that
right
on
december
1?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
the
state
owns
the
minerals
beneath
the
bed.
justice
potter
stewart
wasn't
there
some
reservation
in
the
united
states
of
minerals?
if
so,
what
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
reservation
then
is
beneath.
