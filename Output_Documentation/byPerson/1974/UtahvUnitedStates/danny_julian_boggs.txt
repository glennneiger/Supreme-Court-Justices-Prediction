mr.
danny
julian
boggs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
original
case
is
here
on
exceptions
to
the
report
of
the
special
master
in
reliction
phase
of
the
continuing
litigation
between
utah
and
the
united
states,
over
the
ownership
of
land
and
the
vicinity
of
the
great
salt
lake.
this
litigation
was
authorized
by
the
great
salt
lake
lands
act
of
1965.
pursuant
to
that
act,
the
united
states
in
1967
quitclaim
to
utah
all
of
its
interest
other
than
mineral
rights
within
the
surveyed
meander
line
of
the
great
salt
lake,
that
line
generally
or
not
invariably,
runs
on
land
that
has
been
above
the
lake
level
for
50
years
or
more.
utah
was
to
pay
for
that
land
that
the
united
states
stated
that
it
owned
or
to
litigate
the
united
states
title
in
an
original
action
in
this
court,
utah
chose
to
litigate.
in
the
first
stage
of
this
litigation,
this
court
held
that
the
great
salt
lake
was
inevitable
and
that
utah
does
acquired
title
to
its
bed
at
statehood
in
1896.
this
settled
the
question
of
ownership
of
the
land
that
was
still
underwater
at
the
time
of
the
deed
in
1967.
that
area
is
the
inner
lighter
shaded
area
on
defendants
exhibit
two,
the
map
shown
in
the
back
of
the
special
master’s
report.
we
are
today
concerned
essentially
with
the
area
between
the
level
of
the
lake
at
statehood
and
the
level
of
the
lake
as
of
the
date
of
the
quitclaim
deed.
that
land
is
the
middle
darker
band
shown
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes
sir.
the
defendant’s
exhibit
two
is
about
the
exhibit
from
the
back
of
the
set
of
exhibits.
mr.
justice
stewart
that
is
the
map.
we
are
today
discussing
essentially
the
title
to
approximately,
the
middle,
darker
colored
band
on
exhibit
two.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
the
4200.2
against
4200.8
in
the
396,000
(voice
overlap)
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
25,000.
yes
sir,
i
believe
that
we
both
in
our
briefs
stated
that
we
were
in
agreement
with
the
facts
as
we
each
stated
them.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes
sir.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
the
middle.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
your
honor,
it’s
correct
that
we’re
discussing
specifically
those
areas
in
which
the
united
states
is
the
upland
owner
across
that
middle
land.
the
united
states
contends
that
by
operation
of
the
doctrine
of
reliction
as
consistently
recognized
by
this
court,
the
lake
bed
which
utah
owned
receded
as
the
lake
receded
and
to
the
extent
that
it
was
the
upland
owner,
the
property
interest
of
the
united
states
extended
down
to
the
new
water
level
at
the
date
of
the
quitclaim
deed.
utah
on
the
other
hand,
contends
that
the
measure
of
what
it
received
in
1896
was
absolutely
fixed
as
of
that
date
and
has
not
altered
by
any
change
in
the
waters
of
the
lake.
the
basic
question
is
thus,
whether
the
boundary
between
the
lake
bed,
undisputably
owned
by
utah,
and
the
upland
undisputably
owned
by
the
united
states
is
to
have
been
measured
in
1967
with
relation
to
the
actual
water
level
in
1967
because
the
boundary
is
an
ambulatory
one,
or
whether
that
boundary
should
have
been
measured
with
respect
to
where
the
water
stood
at
statehood
or
even
earlier
in
the
19th
century.
i
would
note
that
once
it
is
decided
as
which
date
is
the
date
on
which
the
line
is
to
be
fixed.
an
exact
line
must
be
determined
which
may
or
may
not
require
further
litigation.
thus,
the
outer
lighter
colored
band
on
the
map
would
be
the
land
between
the
lake
at
statehood
and
the
surveyed
meander
line,
for
as
utah
contends
that
at
statehood,
it
gained
everything
out
to
the
meander
line,
the
united
states
would
contend
that
even
if
the
date
was
fixed
at
statehood,
that
was
fixed
at
about
the
lake
level
of
that
date.
that
outer
band
is
not
in
consideration
in
the
litigation
today.
today
as
i
said,
we
are
concerned
with
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
reliction
to
the
circumstances
of
the
movements
of
the
water
of
the
great
salt
lake.
to
first
state
that
doctrine,
i
would
give
you
what
this
court
said
in
bonelli
last
term
in
which
the
special
master
quoted
that
the
general
law
of
reliction
is
that
the
grantee
of
land,
bounded
by
a
body
of
navigable
water
acquires
a
right
to
any
gradual
accretion
formed
along
that
shore.
and
in
light
of
that,
i
would
look
at
the
physical
facts
of
the
movement
along
the
lake
which
are
undisputed.
the
exhibits
on
the
report
of
the
special
master,
demonstrate
that
the
waters
of
the
great
salt
lake
do
rise
and
fall,
and
as
they
do,
considerable
areas
of
shore
are
exposed
or
covered.
now,
one
major
component
of
this
movement
is
the
change
caused
by
the
passing
of
the
seasons
which
can
be
seen
on
any
of
the
exhibits
that
the
master
has
inserted,
showing
the
levels
of
the
lake.
every
winter
and
spring,
there
is
a
rise
as
precipitation
on
snow
melt
increase
and
every
summer
and
fall,
there
is
a
decline
because
of
less
moisture
and
more
evaporation.
this
seasonal
change
of
course,
the
parties’
all
agree,
does
not
change
the
boundary,
not
because
it
may
be
so
rapid
or
large
as
to
be
visible
or
perceptible
but
simply
because
it
is
a
seasonal
change
as
shown
by
cases
that
we’ve
sighted
at
pages
15
and
16
of
our
brief
in
utah
at
pages
67
and
68
of
their
brief.
in
just
the
same
way,
an
observer
or
a
gauge
on
a
river
would
note
the
rise
of
flood
water
seasonally
or
on
an
ocean
would
note
extraordinary
tides
at
certain
astronomical
seasons.
these
two,
would
not
cause
a
change
in
the
legal
boundary.
another
component
of
the
change
is
caused
by
the
temporary
factors
that
may
come
and
go
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
a
few
days.
these
are
shown
on
exhibit
p-16
which
is
not
reproduced
in
the
master’s
report
but
it’s
simply
a
gauge,
a
continuous
recording
of
the
movements
of
the
lake
over
the
period
of
a
month.
and
that
exhibit
and
the
testimony
show
that
these
changes
are
almost
exclusively
caused
by
a
wind
or
atmospheric
disturbance
which
pushes
down
or
pushes
up
the
lake
in
one
end,
and
then
by
a
so
called
seiche
effect,
the
lake
oscillates
back
and
forth,
just
as
if
you
slash
a
bath
tub,
it
will
slash
back
and
forth
with
diminishing
vigor,
rising
and
falling
at
the
ends
until
it
begins
to
stabilize.
but
this
too
is
a
temporary
occurrence.
but
finally
and
most
profoundly,
the
water
level
is
changed
by
the
effects
of
climate
over
many
years.
a
land
that
is
exposed
or
covered
may
stay
that
way
for
decades.
for
example,
when
the
lake
recently
rose
above
4200
and
one
feet
above
sea
level,
it
covered
the
land
that
had
been
dry
since
before
1930.
and
when
the
lake
went
down
in
the
early
1960s,
the
land
was
exposed
which
had
never
been
uncovered
in
historical
time.
we
submit
that
it
is
these
long
term
effects
only
which
vary
the
legal
boundary.
these
changes
are
exactly
analogous
to
the
changes
on
wandering
rivers
such
as
the
missouri
or
mississippi
with
which
this
court
has
many
times
dealt.
there,
a
river
may
move
gradually
in
one
direction
for
some
years
and
then
reverse
itself
and
return
to
its
previous
location
or
even
beyond,
but
of
course
during
that
movement,
the
river
itself
may
be
rising
and
falling,
covering
and
uncovering
land
due
to
floods
and
droughts
in
temporary
phenomenon.
and
yet
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
doctrine
of
reliction
has
always
been
applied.
i
would
note
that
a
similar
contention
to
utah
as
here
was
made
in
the
case
of
the
missouri
river
and
the
court’s
reply
which
is
cited
on
page
17
of
our
brief
stating
that
it
is
contended
however
that
the
doctrine
of
accretion
has
no
application
the
missouri
river
on
account
of
the
rapid
and
great
changes
constantly
going
on,
but
our
conclusions
are
that
not
withstanding
the
rapidity
of
these
changes,
the
law
of
accretion
controls.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
was
--
that
was
certainly
the
aspect
that
was
before
them
and
the
court
in
dealing
with
that
said
that
you
have
to
if
the
falling
off
of
the
bank
in
that
instance
is
a
result
of
essentially
a
seasonal
flood
that
that
itself
does
not
change
the
ordinary
rule
that
despite
the
fact
that
the
river
may
move
rapidly.
if
taking
the
situation
as
a
whole,
you
can
say
that
there’s
been
a
gradual
or
imperceptible
movement
when
you
say
here
it
is
and
so
many
years
later,
here
it
is,
that
reliction
will
still
apply.
i
would
turn
now
to
the
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
believe
of
the
supreme
court
cases
that
this
may
be
the
only
one,
there
are
certainly
numerous
state
court
cases
which
refer
the
lakes
and
of
course
the
same
rules
have
been
applied
on
an
ocean
which
is
yet
a
third
situation
such
as
hughes
versus
washington
which
this
court
decided
some
six
or
seven
years
ago.
the
statement
has
been
continually
made
through
all
of
these
cases
that
the
law
as
to
accretion
and
as
to
reliction
is
essentially
the
same.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
reliction
is
normally
what’s
being
talked
of
with
regard
to
a
lake
that
is,
the
water
rises
and
falls.
accretion
generally
relates
to
new
land
being
deposited
by
the
movement
of
a
river
on
an
ocean
or
conceivably
even
a
lake
if
you
had
a
heavily
salted
lake.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
that
was
bonelli
involved
the
colorado
river
which
(voice
overlap).
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
couldn’t
say.
i
know
that
certainly
that
it’s
my
impression
that
the
dunes
on
the
great
lake
are
built
up
(voice
overlap).
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
can’t
call
a
specific
case
to
your
attention
at
the
moment.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
you
may
or
may
not
get
that
cut
off.
there
are
many
cases
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
where
the
river
moves
one
way
and
then
it
simply
moves
back
the
other
way
so
that
you
get
that
kind
of
a
movement
which
we
feel
is
quiet
analogous
to
what
has
happened
here.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
right.
they
stated
that
--
when
you
look
at
utah
cases,
this
was
brief
fairly,
thoroughly
before
the
special
master
and
then
because
of
this
courts
decision
in
bonelli,
the
federal
common
law
controlled
--
we
really
not
considered
it
extensively
since
then,
but
my
recollection
of
the
utah
cases
before
hardy
which
include
cases
on
lakes
such
as
utah
lake
which
is
also
a
very
flat
lake.
indicates
that
they
seem
--
on
utah
lake,
it
may
have
some
application
and
the
earlier
utah
cases
would
indicate
that
there
may
have
been
application
even
on
the
great
salt
lake.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well
your
honor,
we
would
submit
and
i
believe
in
our
brief
before
the
special
master
argued
that
even
at
that
time
we
said,
if
you
want
to
consider
hardy
that
the
“uniqueness”
which
is
really
the
underlying
supposition
of
the
utah
argument
is
based
upon
this
temporary
and
seasonal
fluctuations.
so,
this
is
where
we
get
into
the
whole
mathematical
controversy
over
how
gradual
or
perceptible
it
has
been
but
that,
simply
because
during
the
course
of
a
seasonal
rise
and
fall
or
during
the
course
of
a
storm,
the
lake
moves
rapidly
in
one
direction
or
another
that
this
is
not
a
unique
factor.
this
is
not
something
that
is
not
seen
on
rivers
and
mr.
justice
stewart
mentioned
the
great
lake.
so
certainly,
the
great
lakes
even
have
the
same
kind
of
seiche
effect,
where
the
wind
piles
up
the
water
at
one
end
and
then
it
oscillates
back
and
forth.
so,
we
recognize
that
that
case
exist,
we
believe
that
it
suffers
from
the
same
flaws
as
the
doctrine
as
a
whole.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well
your
honor,
that
would
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
that
would
either
be
several
things
that
would
apply
there.
one
is
that
in
certain
of
the
case
is
the
question
of
whether
a
change
has
been
natural
or
not,
has
been
held
to
be
significant.
in
bonelli,
the
court
held
that
it
was
not,
but
certainly,
if
the
--
particularly,
i
think
there
is
a
line
or
two
in
bonelli
that
mentions
that
if
the
drying
up
of
the
lake
by
diverting
the
tributaries
was
caused
by
one
of
the
parties
with
that
specific
intention
that
that
would
certainly
be
a
factor
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
apply.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
we
would
have
to
look
at
exactly
what
the
circumstances
are.
certainly,
there
are
various
cases
that
hold
when
you
simply
drain
a
lake
for
the
purpose
of
doing
something
else
with
it
and
perhaps
you’re
going
to
turn
it
back
that
that
is
not
a
reliction,
that’s
long-year
mining.
and
certainly,
as
i
said,
if
the
united
states
were
to
turn
it
off
for
the
purpose
of
gaining
that
water,
it
would
not
be
a
reliction.
if
as
perhaps
people
thought
in
1963,
the
lake
simply
dried
up
completely,
i
think
we
would
have
to
state
that
that
was
a
reliction.
certainly,
the
great
salt
lake
has
been
drying
up
for
some
10,000
years
and
if
we
were
not
to
say
that
reliction
applied,
i
don’t
know
why
utah
should
not
claim
it
all
the
way
back
to
ancient
lake
bonneville
if
the
boundary
is
not
an
ambulatory
one
but
a
fixed
one
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
as
utah
notes
however,
they
claim
the
water
back
before
where
it
was
in
1896
back
to
the
meander
line
which
was
the
first
time
that
man
started
drawing
those
lines.
i
would
turn
now
to
the
specific
components
required
for
the
operation
of
the
doctrine
of
reliction
and
to
examine
how
they
apply
to
the
facts
of
the
great
salt
lake.
the
key
element
in
the
past
perhaps
before
bonelli,
has
certainly
been
that
the
movement
in
the
waters
edge
is
not
sudden
or
violent
but
gradual.
this
is
stated
in
various
holdings
of
this
court
such
as
philadelphia
company
versus
stimpson,
stating
that
the
title
would
be
fixed
and
would
remain
the
same
when
there
is
a
change
that
is
sudden
or
violent
or
visible
in
a
word
an
evulsion.
now
here,
all
parties
agree
that
no
evulsion
has
taken
place
and
as
we
have
noted
in
our
brief,
there
are
normally
--
when
you
see
the
water
at
one
place
today
and
another
place
20
years
later,
there
is
a
presumption,
that
it
has
moved
by
a
reliction
or
an
accretion.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
the
case
in
that
sense
if
there
--
the
question
is,
is
there
a
specific
lake
case
that
would
hold
that?
i
don’t
believe
so.
the
doctrines
have
generally
been
spoken
of
together
and
have
not
been
differentiated
in
that
way.
now,
the
brief
discussed
at
some
length
the
question
of
just
what
movement
should
be
measured
and
whether
that
movement
is
imperceptible
and
i’m
prepared
to
discuss
that
further
if
you
wish.
but
we
would
note
that
in
bonelli,
this
court
casts
considerable
doubt
upon
the
necessity
even
for
literal
imperceptibility.
the
court
in
bonelli
noted
the
interest
and
the
policies
behind
reliction
saying,
that
a
riparian
owner
has
an
expectancy
and
an
interest
in
remaining
riparian
to
his
land
and
that,
since
he
might
lose
the
use
of
his
land
when
the
water
rises,
so
he
should
gain
the
land
that
would
be
exposed
when
the
water
falls.
and
in
bonelli,
the
court
found
those
policies
so
strong
that
it
held
that
a
riparian
owner
was
entitled
to
remain
riparian
even
though
the
land,
the
water
actually
moved
perceptibly.
thus,
the
master
statement
that
he
could
not
find
the
movements
of
the
lake
to
be
imperceptible,
does
not
necessarily
defeat
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
reliction
after
bonelli.
in
any
event,
as
we
essentially
--
the
same
answer
we
would
give
to
the
hardy
salt
question.
the
examples
given
by
the
master
at
pages
17
to
20
of
his
report
about
these
great
fluctuations,
each
example
that
he
speaks
of
are
essentially
the
seasonal
and
daily
changes
that
we
spoke
of.
now,
we
concede
that
during
a
seasonal
rise
or
during
a
storm,
you
can
look
at
the
water's
edge
and
you
may
be
able
to
see
it
move.
but
certainly,
in
the
course
of
a
missouri
river
flood
or
a
bay
of
fundy
spring
tide,
the
effect
on
the
shore
lands
would
be
equally
visible
and
perhaps
even
more
dramatic
than
these
changes
on
the
great
salt
lake.
now,
the
second
factor
on
which
the
master
relied
was
whether
the
changes
in
the
lake
were
reasonably
permanent.
a
close
reading
of
his
conclusions
of
law
in
fact,
i
think
indicates
that
this
was
the
bedrock
of
his
decision
because
he
first
stated
that
the
federal
common
law
of
reliction
does
generally
apply
and
then
stated
that
the
question
of
ownership
of
the
lands
in
question,
“depends
on
whether
the
exposure
of
the
land
referred
to,
either
by
a
perceptible
or
a
gradual
and
imperceptible
process,”
thus,
perhaps
taking
account
of
this
change
in
bonelli.
“constituted
a
reasonably
permanent
or
stable
addition
to
the
riparian
land.
and
this
foundation
of
the
master's
report,
we
contend
is
simply
not
the
law.
certainly,
none
of
this
court’s
cases
over
the
past
century
and
more
have
indicated
that
there
can
be
no
reliction
or
accretion
if
the
body
of
water
under
consideration
may
reverse
its
course.
in
fact,
many
of
those
cases
concerned
body
of
water
that
were
known
for
wandering
back
and
forth
such
as
the
mississippi
and
missouri
rivers.
we
sighted
also
a
number
of
state
cases
concerning
these
rivers
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
just
the
same
way
when
the
river
moves
when
the
lake
goes
back
up
as
it
has
in
the
present
time.
utah
is
the
owner
of
the
lake
bed
just
as
the
owner
of
the
river
bed
--
it’s
ownership
(voice
overlap).
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well
your
honor,
it’s
going
to
cover
that
in
the
section
on
equities
toward
the
end
but
i’ll
handle
it
right
now.
certainly,
i
think
that
at
the
bottom.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
at
the
bottom,
the
real
difficult
(voice
overlap).
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
at
the
bottom,
the
real
difficult
that
the
united
states
had
over
this
case,
i
think
is
not
a
legal
one.
it’s
the
equitable
position
that
we’re
asking
them
to
pay
for
land
that’s
now
underwater.
but
that’s
simply
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
we
don’t
know,
that’s
exactly
the
point.
we
passed
a
deed
in
1967.
it’s
just
exactly
the
same
as
if
i’m
a
river
bed
owner,
a
river
shore
owner
and
i’m
worried
about
the
river
just
as
utah
was
worried
about
the
lake
and
i
buy
the
land
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
from
the
other
owner
and
contract
to
pay
him
for
it.
and
in
the
passage
of
time,
the
river
starts
moving
over
there
and
lo
and
behold
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
that’s
correct.
but
i’m
saying
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
but
your
honor,
the
question
of
who
owns
it
--
we
submit
cannot
turn
on
what
--
on
the
specific
of
what’s
happened
to
the
lake
since
then
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
we’re
relying
on
reliction
as
to
the
question
of
what
was
passed
by
that
deed
in
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no
your
honor.
if
it
would
have
relicted
more,
that’s
exactly
the
opposite
--
that’s
exactly
the
point.
if
the
lake
had
gone
further
down,
we
could
not
have
asked
utah
to
pay
for
that
land
because
they
would
have
already
owned
it
in
1967
as
a
result
of
this
courts
decision
on
the
navigability
issue.
and
that’s
what
--
the
water
went
up
and
you
might
say
that
utah
lost
its
gamble.
they’re
being
asked
to
pay
for
land
that’s
now
under
water.
if
the
water
had
gone
down,
the
united
states
would
have
lost
the
gamble
and
utah
(voice
overlap).
well
utah
--
now,
another
point
on
the
equity
is
that
utah
has
the
opportunity
of
course
simply
to
renounce
the
act,
not
pay
for
it
and
then
they’ll
own
it
under
the
doctrine
of
reliction.
what
they’ve
contending
for
here
is
sort
of
a
both
ways
test
when
the
water
is
up.
we
feel
that
they
want
reliction
to
apply
and
when
the
water
is
down,
they
don’t.
another
example
of
this
your
honor,
they
contend
throughout
that
they
have
great
interest
in
the
lands
on
the
edge,
marsh
lands
and
this
sort
of
thing.
and
yet,
under
their
contention,
when
the
water
goes
up
whether
above
statehood
or
above
the
meander
line.
we
have
this
controversy
that
the
one
it
goes
above
the
1896
levels
--
then
utah
does
not
own
those
edge
lands.
utah’s
boundary
by
their
contention
is
exactly
fixed
and
there
they
are
left
with
an
area
in
the
middle
of
the
lake
in
the
upland
owners
such
as
the
united
states
and
private
parties,
owned
all
of
those
edge
lands.
and
that’s
the
reason
that
we
believe
that
here
just
as
in
--
as
in
all
of
the
other
cases
that
have
applied
reliction
that
that
is
the
basis
for
having
an
ambulatory
boundary
rather
than
a
fixed
boundary.
we
recognize
that
there
are
certain
problems
that
an
ambulatory
boundary
causes
here,
the
court
noted
similar
problems
in
louisiana
versus
texas
with
a
three-mile
limit.
but
we
would
submit
and
i
think
this
is
the
basis
of
all
of
our
arguments
that
the
fixed
boundary
causes
even
more
problems
for
periods
of
decades
and
even
longer,
the
utah
who
is
supposed
to
control
the
lake
would
find
that
large
areas
of
the
lake
were
out
of
its
control
and
perhaps
for
equal
periods
or
riparian
owner
who
has
an
interest
in
remaining
riparian
would
find
the
lake
to
be
miles
from
him
and
it
would
remain
there
for
30
years.
this
is
really
the
difference
between
the
problems
that
are
caused
by
the
seasonal
fluctuations,
and
the
fact
that
the
long
run
fluctuations
of
the
lake
are
far
greater
that
you
do
have
the
seasonal
fluctuation
but
it
will
be
over
here
one
year
and
it
will
stay
there.
and
then
20
or
30
years
later
before
it
may
ever
come
back
or
it
may
never
come
back.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
certainly.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
from
the
other
people
concerned
with
this
other
litigation
that
we
would
not
be
greatly
distressed
with
theirs.
we
feel
that
our
suggestion
is
in
accordance
with
the
previous
decrees.
apparently,
since
the
brief
of
utah
was
submitted
that
the
tenth
circuit
decision
has
come
in
and
i
believe
that
it
was
essentially
adverse
to
the
united
states
or
at
least
made
no
use
of
our
argument
concerning
the
words
such
as,
we
have
no
strong
feelings
or
direction
on
that.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
very
briefly.
i
would
address
myself
to
the
question
that
utah
has
raised
with
regard
to
the
management
that
they
say
of
these
valuable
mineral
interest.
now,
it's
interesting
that
on
the
one
hand,
they
say
that
the
riparian
owners
have
--
that
these
lands
aren’t
very
valuable
that
they
have
no
interest
in
them.
and
on
the
other
hand,
they
wish
to
continue
to
own
them
in
an
essentially
a
proprietary
capacity.
we
believe
that
this
implicates
the
doctrine
that
this
court
brought
up
in
the
bonelli
case
which
was,
in
bonelli,
the
lands
we
believe
were
valuable.
they
were
good
for
recreation,
for
farming
and
so
forth.
but
they
were
not
related
to
the
purposes
for
which
the
state
had
been
given
the
bed
of
the
lake
in
the
first
place
--
navigation
and
related
purposes.
so
that
while
utah
has
a
public
interest
in
the
sense
that
the
state
would
like
to
own
the
property
generally.
just
as
in
bonelli,
we
feel
that
it
does
not
have
the
kind
of
public
benefit
for
navigation
and
other
purposes
that
would
make
the
doctrine
of
reliction
apply.
finally,
we
would
point
out
that
justice
in
the
tideland
case
where
if
oil
lies
half
inside
and
half
outside
the
three-mile
limit
there
maybe
a
problem.
that
was
exactly
the
purpose
of
the
great
salt
lake
lands
act.
if
utah
accepts
the
act,
then
there
will
be
a
permanent,
fixed
boundary
hopefully
above
the
level
of
the
lake.
but
the
fact
that
there
was
a
problem
requiring
legislative
solution
that
is
utah
run
the
congress
and
wanted
them
to
pass
an
act
to
keep
them
from
being
hurt
when
the
lake
declined,
does
not
keep
the
doctrine
of
reliction
from
basically
being
applicable.
the
prettly
charge
that
we
have
all
through
here
if
you
took
that
kind
of
a
daily
chart,
annually
chart,
on
seasonal
and
temporary
movements,
we
believe
that
similar
charts
could
be
shown
on
many
other
bodies
of
water.
we
believe
that
the
basic
principles
of
reliction
which
apply
to
give
an
ambulatory
boundary
rather
than
a
fixed
boundary,
should
apply
here
and
that
the
solution
is
the
solution
that
the
congress
gave
by
the
passage
of
the
great
salt
lake
lands
act.
