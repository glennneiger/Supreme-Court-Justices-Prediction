chief

e.

we
hear
arguments
next
in
number
31
original,
state
of
utah
against
the
united
states.
mr.
boggs,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let’s
find
that
map,
we
got
several
exhibits
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dewsnup.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
proceed,
let
me
suggest
that
if
you
gentlemen
find
some
area
of
common
ground,
literally
and
figuratively,
you’ll
let
us
know
promptly,
won’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
speaking
for
myself.
i’m
not
too
clear
either.
but
if
you
two
gentlemen
can’t
be
clear
on
it,
then
no
one
can.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
these
inlets
--
these
streams
coming
in,
all
from
the
mountains?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that
was
partly
because
there
were
such
sharp
changes
within
even
in
a
24-hour
period.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
noticed
that
if
he
makes
the
observation
that
on
june
6,
or
the
water
level
rose
and
fell
ten
times
that
the
lake
level
for
that
day
averaged
a
stable
level.
but
then,
at
the
end
of
the
day
on
june
5
to
the
beginning
of
june
6,
the
water
dropped
to
more
than
two
feet
and
the
wind
apparently
comes
for
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
to
hold
that
a
little
bit
higher
for
us.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further.
you
have
about
two
minutes
mr.
boggs.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
31
original,
utah
against
the
united
states,
we
overruled
the
exceptions
filed
by
the
united
states
and
adopt
and
direct
the
entry
of
the
decree
proposed
by
the
special
master
with
modifications
as
set
out
in
an
opinion
for
the
court
filed
today.
mr.
justice
marshall
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
