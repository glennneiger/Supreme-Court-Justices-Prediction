mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
we
will.
i
would
like
a
little
clear
picture
as
to
exactly
what
we
might
be
expected
to
do
in
that
regard
so
far
as
making
some
interim
report
back
to
the
court.
i’m
not
too
clear
on
that.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
well,
let
me
spend
just
one
second
at
the
beginning
with
respect
to
the
words
“such
as”.
utah
certainly
doesn’t
want
to
be
technical
with
regard
to
a
couple
of
words
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
and
incidentally,
the
tenth
circuit
case
was
decided
and
this
court
denied
cert
two
or
three
weeks
ago
on
that
case.
but
amoco
oil
company
is
ready
to
drill,
offshore
drilling
of
the
great
salt
lake
now
and
the
army
core
of
engineers
has
contended
that
amoco
cannot
go
ahead
pursuant
to
the
authority
it
has
in
the
state
of
utah
because
under
rivers
and
harbors
act
they
have
jurisdiction,
they
have
to
apply
in
that
but
go
through
the
environmental
study
etcetera.
well
that
hassle
never
was
before
the
court
before.
and
the
argument
made
in
the
tenth
circuit
was
this
court’s
insertion
by
it’s
own
initiative
of
the
word
“such
as”
was
in
adjudication
of
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
united
states,
applied
to
the
great
salt
lake
as
a
navigable
water
of
the
united
states.
now,
as
our
brief
points
out
and
i
think
that
the
brief
is
enough
of
a
background
and
that
is
why
we
did
not
want
a
couple
of
innocent
looking
words
to
create
all
kinds
of
problem
that
the
actual
physical
administration
and
management
of
the
lake.
and
so,
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
on
the
words
“such
as”
if
the
government
does
not
insist
on
putting
demand,
we
would
like
to
have
them
out
and
if
we
can
agree
on
that
now,
then
we’ve
agreed
on
all
three
changes
suggested
at
the
latter
part
of
our
brief
of
the
event
that
the
court
looks
upon
special
master
decree
as
one
that
might
be
entered
here.
this
case
is
rather
unusual
and
that
the
parties
really
do
not
disagree
on
the
legal
principles
of
reliction
as
maybe
stated
and
as
they
have
developed
a
common
law
and
as
they
appear
to
be
reflected
in
the
federal
cases
that
have
applied
the
doctrine
and
we
really
don’t
defer
with
respect
to
the
facts.
the
real
difference
is
which
facts
are
relevant
to
this
case
and
whether
or
not
these
facts
would
seem
to
satisfy
the
doctrine
of
reliction.
now,
the
thing
that
seem
to
oppress
the
special
master
the
most,
and
i
think
through
his
discussion,
his
findings,
his
conclusions
that
he
mentions
more
than
a
dozen
time
the
unique,
unusual
circumstances
of
the
great
salt
lake,
this
simply
cause
the
doctrine
of
reliction
not
to
fit.
and
the
reason
for
that
as
the
master
points
out
is
this
briny
residue
of
the
ancient
lake
bonneville,
the
great
salt
lake
is
in
the
bottom
--
very
flat
based.
the
shores
are
virtually
horizontal.
it
has
no
outlet
as
most
lakes
have
some
kind
of
tributaries
flowing
in,
in
some
kind
of
outlet
and
they
serve
to
be
self
regulated.
the
great
salt
lake
isn’t
--
you
put
water
in
it
and
it’s
like
putting
water
in
the
glass.
the
only
way
it’s
going
to
leave
is
by
evaporation.
and
because
of
the
very
flat
shore
lands,
any
water
that
comes
in
until
it
evaporates
out,
it
causes
the
water
to
move
out
almost
horizontally
and
then,
as
the
water
evaporates,
it
moves
back
in
almost
horizontally
rather
than
a
body
of
water
would
if
it
had
reasonably
steep
shores.
and
so,
because
of
those
very
unusual
characteristic
as
the
special
master
continue
to
characterize
and
is
unique,
he
just
could
not
find
on
the
evidence
presented
that
there
had
been
any
gradual
imperceptible
or
reasonably
permanent
process
which
had
created
new
uplands
as
distinguished
from
the
part
of
the
bed
of
the
lake
was
--
there
was
subject
to
inundation
from
time
to
time.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
they
are
all
from
the
mountains.
some
distance,
removed
when
the
streams
get
next
to
the
lake
for
a
period
of
miles
or
10,
20,
30
or
40
miles,
they
might
meander
slowly
across
relatively
flat
terrain,
even
though
the
head
waters
would
be
in
the
mountainous
regions
of
wasatch
range.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
yes,
as
mr.
arnold
of
the
united
states
geological
survey
explained
at
some
length
and
i
think
it
summarized
to
the
extent
of
the
brief.
the
winds,
the
temperature
or
the
salinity
of
the
waters,
the
gradience
of
the
shores,
all
of
these
things
intermixed
because
the
lake
continuously
fluctuate.
it’s
virtually
impossible
to
have
a
moment
when
the
total
inflow
exactly
equals
total
evaporation.
you
just
don’t
get
that
moment
in
time.
and
so,
however
gradually
in
volume,
the
lake
is
either
going
up
or
going
down
and
that
movement
is
greatly
exaggerated
by
the
relatively
flat
shore
lands
--
the
extremely
flat
shore
land.
i
would
like
to
mention
a
few
of
these
practical
or
analytical
errors
that
we
think
and
the
master
thought
that
the
government
had
fallen
into
and
the
analysis
of
its
case.
when
the
government
said
that
the
only
practical
argument
against
the
government’s
case
is
if
the
lands
of
water
covered
now
that
just
simply
isn’t
true.
for
one
thing,
the
government
chooses
to
ignore
the
actual
water
movement.
here’s
a
basic
hydrograph
which
appears
as
the
first
attachment
to
the
master’s
report
exhibit
p-4.
it
shows
the
basic
annual
movements
of
the
lake
from
1850
to
1973
when
the
hearings
were
held.
and
incidentally
when
the
lake
was
first
viewed
in
1850
was
the
same
elevation,
almost
exactly
as
it
was
in
1973,
although
the
variations
from
year
to
year
and
month
to
month
and
over
the
long
term
are
rather
remarkable.
but
in
any
event,
the
government
ignores
the
actual
water
level
or
the
actual
water
movement
or
rate
of
water
movement
and
computes
an
average
annual
stage
of
the
lake
by
computing
the
level
or
stage
of
the
lake,
one
year
as
it
would
compare
with
the
preceding
year,
which
serves
to
remove
the
daily,
weekly,
monthly
seasonal
fluctuation.
now,
the
parties
agreed
that
daily,
weekly
seasonal
fluctuation
do
not
result
and
it
changes
boundaries
by
reliction.
but
the
government
then
goes
to
compute
the
rate
of
movement
of
the
water
by
reference
to
this
averages
which
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
actual
rate
of
movement
of
the
water.
and
the
government
calculates
that
the
water
moves
at
a
speed
of
one-and-a-half
inches
per
hour
on
the
average,
all
the
way
around
the
lake
and
15
inches
per
hour
in
its
most
rapid
rate
of
speed.
but
that
just
simply
isn’t
so.
and
the
government
would
have
to
acknowledge
that
isn’t
so
as
well
because
they
base
their
calculation
not
on
the
water
movement
itself
but
upon
assumed
levels
or
stages
of
the
lake.
a
second
analytical
error
is
the
governments’
failure
to
consider
in
computing
its
average
movement.
the
special
master
made
a
special
note
of
this
and
the
pictures
throughout
the
brief,
the
black
and
white
pictures
i
think
illustrate.
generally,
the
lands
are
very,
very
leveled
but
where
the
mountains
come
out
into
the
lake,
there
are
variations
in
the
gradient
which
would
have
a
direct
impact
on
the
rate
of
movement
of
the
water
where
the
land
is
really
flat.
the
lake
comes
up,
the
water
moves
over
that
much
more
rapidly
where
a
mountain
comes
down
at
45
degree
angle
into
the
lake.
another
error
in
the
governments’
calculation,
it
based
its
rapid
imperceptible
criteria
and
argument
on
the
350-mile
contour
line
which
is
situated
within
the
lands
now
in
dispute.
but
that
350-mile
line
is
the
surveyed
meander
line
that
the
parties
used
as
a
basis
for
exchange
in
a
quitclaim
deed
to
illustrate
that
problem
very
briefly.
we’re
talking
about
an
inland
lower
elevation
line
that
is
substantially
shorter
than
the
surveyed
meander
line
that
might
have
a
distance
of
approximately
350
miles.
now,
that
mathematical
calculation
might
not
be
terribly
serious,
the
government
contends
that
even
if
its
off
50
miles
in
the
estimate
that
the
rate
of
movement
of
the
water
is
still
gradual
and
imperceptible
if
it
can
use
its
averaging
technique
to
compute
the
rate
of
movement
of
the
water.
and
let
me
emphasize
in
this
regard
that
judge
fahey,
special
master
fahey
was
not
overly
impressed
with
the
rapid
actual
movement
of
the
water
that
will
move
perhaps
several
inches
per
second
in
the
flattest
area.
his
conclusion
was
while
that
water
movement
does
not
change
boundaries,
when
you’re
talking
about
reliction
and
the
change
in
boundaries
by
the
doctrine
of
reliction,
you
simply
cannot
ignore
the
water
movements
for
the
purpose
of
telling
where
the
water
is
and
where
it
goes
and
whether
or
not
the
shorelands
we
are
talking
about
have
been
exposed
with
some
kind
of
reasonable
permanence
or
some
kind
of
stability
so
that
if
you’re
going
to
cause
changes
in
real
estate
titles
you
don’t
have
to
do
it
everyday
or
every
week.
and
so,
that
was
the
emphasis
that
the
special
master
placed
on
the
water
movement.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
well,
not
necessarily,
i
think
that
those
calculations
were
based
on
some
exhibits
that
we
prepared
and
introduced
which
were
not
necessarily
the
wind
tide
days.
mr.
arnold
identified
certain
days
as
being
definitely
wind
tides
and
those
figures
there
were
based
on
what
appeared
to
be
reasonably
average
days
from
the
june
1967
hydrograph.
what
the
special
master
did,
he
noted
the
variations
and
the
dramatic
fluctuations
over
long
term
periods,
intermediate
periods
and
short
terms
periods
and
then
said,
well,
this
actual
water
movement
does
not
necessarily
result
in
a
changed
--
does
not
changed
by
reliction.
still,
we
cannot
ignore
these
fluctuations,
dramatic
as
they
are
and
their
impact
on
this
flat
shore
lands
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
common
law
has
evolved
the
doctrine
that
reapplied
to
the
great
salt
lake.
a
plain
and
simple
fact
that
the
master
review
is
that
we
just
don’t
have
another
body
of
water,
an
anglo-american
jurisprudence
like
the
great
salt
lake.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
yes,
that’s
true.
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
comments
with
respect
to
what
we
have
called
the
government
shooting
boundary
and
the
government
has
said
in
its
reply
brief
that
it
is
not
a
shooting
boundary
but
i’m
not
able
to
tell
how
the
government
would
calculate
its
boundary
based
on
its
averages
of
the
doctrine
of
reliction
and
accretion
developed.
as
by
small
and
imperceptible
degrees,
little
by
little,
gradually
either
deposits
would
form
and
form
fast
land
as
in
accretion
where
the
water
would
gradually
and
imperceptibly
change
so
that
the
stage
in
the
body
of
water
has
changed.
and
the
annual
fluctuations
of
the
lake
from
its
average
high
water
to
average
high
water
in
the
following
year
would
not
expose
this
newly
created
land
or
newly
exposed
land
and
a
new
water
mark,
ordinary
high
water
mark
would
form.
and
then
you
have
land
formed
either
by
accretion
or
reliction.
but
the
government
seems
to
suggest
that
it
would
take
the
average
annual
readings
of
a
particular
year
and
having
computed
that
average
that
that
level
would
then
be
a
sign
for
january
1
of
the
following
calendar
year
and
that
would
be
the
boundary
separating
the
reliction
land
from
the
state
owned
bed
of
the
lake.
then,
there
are
some
suggestion
that
maybe
if
you
take
intermediate
readings
of
periods
shorter
than
a
year,
i’m
holding
up
what
is
exhibit
--
plaintiff’s
exhibit
13
which
the
special
master
did
not
attach
to
his
report.
and
maybe,
i
will
not
be
able
to
illustrate
this
too
well
but
each
one
of
these
about
an
inch
and
a
half
horizontal
distant
sections.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
is
a
one
year
period
of
time.
let
the
government
see
this.
if
you
take
for
example
the
year
1968,
then
this
follows
the
water
level
growing
to
the
period
of
1968.
if
you
take
an
average
water
level
for
the
year
1968,
and
use
that
for
january
1,
1969,
then
the
minute
that
you
assess
your
contour
line
as
the
boundary
of
the
water
covered
and
the
it's
got
to
remain
water
covered
for
practically
the
entire
year
of
1969
and
in
some
cases,
one,
two,
three
or
nearly
four
feet
in
vertical
elevation
which
will
need
about
200,000
acres
of
the
water
covered
bed
of
the
lake
would
under
the
government's
view
of
the
doctrine
of
reliction
--
it
would
be
the
reliction
boundary
line.
and
you
will
see
that
if
you
follow
these
through
from
year
to
year,
and
every
year
when
the
lake
is
on
the
rise
that
it
has
been
in
recent
years,
the
governments’
view
of
the
doctrine
of
reliction
each
january
1,
you’re
going
to
be
placing
the
reliction
boundary
line
underneath
the
water,
and
it’s
going
to
stay
under
the
water
for
most
of
the
year.
and
that’s
about
as
diametrically
opposed
to
the
common
law
concept
of
reliction
as
it
could
be.
another
practical
aspect
that
isn’t
of
any
great
legal
consequence
is
that
these
lands
are
no
particular
value
to
upland
riparian
owners.
it’s
not
the
typical
case
where
someone
needs
to
pour
about
or
needs
access
to
the
water
for
the
typical
riparian
purposes.
we
have
included
in
our
brief,
the
black
and
white
pictures
which
show
the
lands
in
dispute
in
various
places
around
the
lake.
the
colored
pictures
which
are
in
exhibit
p-6
were
taken
when
the
water
level
had
just
about
exactly
inundated
or
covered
the
lands
in
dispute.
i’m
sure
that
these
pictures
won’t
convey
much
from
this
distance.
but
if
the
court
cares
to
look
at
exhibit
p-6
and
note
the
shorelands,
immediately
upland
from
the
lands
that
are
in
dispute,
we
would
see
the
so
called
riparian
uplands
where
the
claimed
riparian
uplands
that
would
be
claiming
the
relicted
lands
in
dispute
or
the
lands
in
dispute
that
the
government
claims
a
reliction.
the
only
point
here
as
you
go
through
all
of
these
pictures,
you
will
see
these
flat,
mud
flats,
bogging
marsh
lands
that
have
no
practical
value
except
to
the
state
of
utah
in
connection
with
the
development
of
the
mineral
resources
of
the
lake
and
other
state
programs
on
the
lake.
and
the
typical
case
where
there
would
be
compelling
needs
to
protect
riparian
or
upland
access
to
the
lake
or
to
confer
“reliction
lands”
simply
are
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
all
of
the
land
in
dispute
practically
was
under
water
at
the
time
of
the
hearings.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
this
exhibit
has
22
black
and
white
pictures
which
show
the
land
now
in
dispute.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
yes.
not
all
of
the
land
but
a
good
part
of
--
these
were
taken
in
the
late
fall
of
1972
(voice
overlap).
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
february
of
1973.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
no.
by
february
of
1973,
the
lands
were
within
about
one
tenth
of
a
foot
of
being
fully
covered
and
within
a
few
weeks
after
the
hearing,
they
were
fully
covered.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
you
will
if
you
look
at
the
colored
pictures
because
they
were
taken
three
or
four
days
before
the
hearing.
if
you
look
at
the
black
and
white
pictures,
they
were
taken
six
months
earlier
and
the
lake
was
a
couple
of
feet
lower
at
that
time
and
did
expose
many
of
the
lands
in
dispute.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
well,
it
was
a
seasonal.
the
lake
is
now
climbing.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
lake
as
of
the
first
of
december
was
almost
back
to
4200.
it
fell
during
the
summer
and
as
of
december
1,
it
was
4199.35.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
i
think
so,
yes.
it
just
shows
that
we’ve
taken
a
depth
for
a
while
during
the
summer
part
of
these
lands
were
exposed.
they’re
virtually
all
water
covered
now.
they
certainly
will
be
within
another
couple
of
months.
again,
this
is
the
seasonal
fluctuation.
one
of
the
--
moving
on
to
another
item
and
that
is
what
i
briefly
alluded
to
before
with
regard
to
the
stability
of
real
estate
titles,
special
master
fahey,
put
a
good
deal
of
emphasis
on
that.
the
evidence
showed
that
almost
all
of
the
lake
bed
in
shorelands
area
had
been
leased
by
the
state
of
utah
to
american
oil
company
and
i’ve
already
indicated
that
there
are
processes
to
drill.
now,
whether
oil
and
gas
will
be
discovered
there
or
not.
this
illustrates
a
kind
of
problem
if
there
had
to
be
an
accounting
for
the
mineral
ownership
of
the
overlying
land
owners,
the
riparian
owners,
the
united
states
and
private
parties
will
own
down
to
the
bed
of
the
great
salt
lake
wherever
that
line
might
be.
if
we
had
a
boundary
that
was
moving
each
day
or
each
month
or
even
each
year,
i
still
don’t
know
what
the
governments’
theory
is
as
to
how
its
boundary
would
move
on
a
month
to
month
basis
or
whether
it
is
a
january
1
to
january
1.
but
it
would
be
almost
an
impossible
prospect
to
try
to
calculate
where
your
boundary
was
moving
with
respect
to
any
underground
oil
pool
by
having
a
surface
boundary
running
back
and
forth.
the
state
of
utah
had
control
over
mineral
development
there,
the
state
might
want
to
produce
oil
and
gas
only
during
the
winter
time
when
the
water
level
was
at
the
highest
which
would
expand
the
oil
pool
and
then
not
produce
during
the
summer
when
the
lake
would
withdraw.
i
would
like
to
note
briefly
that
the
government
does
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
this
case
even
though
it’s
a
defendant.
utah
made
its
proof.
this
court
concluded
that
the
lake
was
inevitable.
utah
did
it
statehood
get
titled
to
the
land
now
in
dispute.
in
this
phase
of
the
proceeding,
the
united
states
is
trying
to
divest
utah
of
lands
that
this
court
has
held
in
this
case
belonged
to
the
state
of
utah.
as
such,
if
there
are
any
evidentiary
failings
anywhere
which
prevent
any
more
definitive
findings
than
the
master
has
made,
the
united
states
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
elements
of
reliction.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
i
think
that’s
wholly
irrelevant.
the
government
makes
that
statement
in
its
brief
and
it
cites
i
think
in
arizona
law
review
article.
that
law
review
article
in
turn
cites
a
colorado
state
case
which
simply
says
that
if
you
have
got
a
dispute,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
water
moves
so
rapidly,
you
have
an
evulsion
or
whether
it’s
an
accretion
that
the
accretion
will
be
presumed
unless
an
evulsion
is
proved.
but
an
evulsion
has
never
been
an
issue
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
it's
just
wholly
irrelevant
to
the
great
salt
lake.
a
question
was
raised
incidentally
as
to
whether
or
not
any
other
cases
--
lake
cases
have
arisen
and
mr.
justice
white
was
asking
whether
salt
lake
might
have
dried.
when
united
states
against
holt
state
bank,
mud
lake
did
go
dry
in
minnesota.
and
there,
the
issue
was
not
one
of
reliction
or
accretion
--
it
was
not
raised
but
the
title
was
sustained
in
the
state
as
against
claim
from
upland
patentees
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
it
was
drained
for
the
purpose
of
permanent
agricultural
pursuit.
a
lot
of
title
questions
have
risen
on
lakes
but
i’m
not
aware
of
any
federal
reliction-accretion
questions.
i
would
like
to
mention
before
my
time
is
fully
at
the
state
law
aspect.
after
this
court
decided
bonelli
cattle
company
which
incidentally
was
a
year
ago
to
date
on
december
17
last
year.
the
state
of
utah
had
contended
that
state
law
applied
since
the
effect
of
any
decision
here
would
be
divesting
the
state
of
utah
of
land
that
undeniably
was
owned
by
the
state
through
a
common
law
doctrine.
after
bonelli
however,
the
state
of
utah
advised
the
master
that
in
light
of
bonelli,
we
thought
that
we
could
not
urge
the
master
to
decide
this
case
based
on
the
state
law.
but
we
left
our
foot
in
the
door
in
the
event
that
if
for
any
reason,
the
master
should
decide
or
this
case
should
decide
these
unusual
and
unique
features
of
the
great
salt
lake
are
reliction
lands
under
federal
rules
of
property
law,
then
this
would
be
an
ideal
case
for
borrowing
the
state
law
for
a
purpose
of
resolving
the
great
salt
lake
question
because
the
hardy
salt
case
made
it
abundantly
clear
what
the
state
law
is.
the
state
of
utah
has
managed
and
administered
these
lands
in
disputes
in
statehood.
the
federal
government
had
winkling
that
it
even
wanted
to
make
a
claim
of
these
lands
until
1961.
i
think
it
was
1961.
in
any
event,
the
public
programs
and
pursuits
and
interest
of
the
state
of
utah,
the
state
owns
a
bed
of
the
lake,
the
minerals
and
solution
--
the
minerals
under
the
bed
of
the
lake
in
part
because
of
the
litigation
in
this
case.
and
borrowing
state
law
in
this
case
would
not
necessarily
set
a
(inaudible)
for
borrowing
state
law
in
other
similar
cases
because
of
the
very
unique
--
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
yes.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
there
was
a
reservation
in
the
deed
that
the
united
states
gave
to
the
state
of
utah
--
the
state
of
utah
does
not
claim
that
by
virtue
of
any
conveyance
in
the
united
states.
when
the
state
obtained
the
bed
of
the
lake
at
statehood,
by
virtue
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
it
got
the
bed
and
the
minerals
contained
within
the
bed.
so
this
court
adjudicated
that
in
the
early
navigation
route.
mr.
richard
l.
dewsnup
would
have
no
effect.
they
reserve
minerals
and
something
they
didn’t
known
any
part
of.
i
don’t
want
to
leave
the
impression
that
i
think
that
these
lands
would
be
reliction
lands
under
federal
law.
we
think
that
they
very
clearly
are
not,
as
special
master
fahey
felt
compelled
to
apply
federal
law
in
the
light
of
bonelli
and
he
did.
we
think
that
he
decided
that
correctly.
he
considered
a
great
many
exhibits
and
other
evidence
beyond
what
he
has
attached
to
his
report
and
what
the
three
minor
corrections
we
discussed
at
the
beginning.
the
state
of
utah
respectfully
requested
at
all
other
respects
as
special
masters
report
conclusion,
findings
and
decree
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
