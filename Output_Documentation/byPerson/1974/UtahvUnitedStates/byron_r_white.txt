so,
you
think
the
reliction
--
it
would
be
called
reliction
if
suddenly,
all
the
waters
that
runs
in
to
the
--
all
the
streams
that
run
into
the
great
salt
lake
were
diverted?
justice

white
and
then,
the
lake
just
hasn’t
any
water
running
into
it
and
it
just
dries
up.
is
that
reliction?
justice
byron
r.
white
think
about
it
now
--
would
it
be
a
reliction
or
not?
justice

utah
has
been
a
(inaudible)
justice
byron

white
and
what
happens
when
the
--
if
you’re
right,
when
the
bottom
of
the
salt
lake
becomes
uncovered,
there’s
a
reliction
--
then
what
happens
when
its
covered
for
another
20
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
you
pay
them
back,
what
would’ve
paid
you
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you’re
asking
them
to
pay
you
for
(voice
overlap)
so
you
owned
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
it’s
not
covered.
justice

white
it
may
be
underwater
for
quite
a
while
for
all
you
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
alright
but
you
have
another
condition
in
your
deed.
we’ll
have
to
decide
out
who
--
we
have
to
decide
who
owns
it
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
a
big
difference.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
but
you’re
relying
on
reliction.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
relicted
more
or
you
would
be
relying
more.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
have
a
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
except
for
these
differences
that
divide
you,
would
it
be
feasible
for
you
to
agree
as
to
on
a
decree?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
some
of
their
suggestions
you
abide,
that
we
wouldn’t
have
to
decide
which
one
of
you
--.
justice
byron
r.
white
can’t
you
do
that?
