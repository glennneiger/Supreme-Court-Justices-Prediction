mr.
boggs,
you
say
that
we’re
discussing
the
inner
darker
and
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that’s
assuming
that
all
of
the
circumference
of
the
lake
were
claimed
by
the
united
states
though
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
wasn’t
what
the
court
was
addressing
itself
to,
the
contention
to
parties
that
along
the
missouri
river,
great
big
pieces
of
the
bank
would
sluff
off.
and
you
could
physically
see
them
go.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
really,
you’re
typical
regimen
in
accretion
case
in
a
river
is
quite
different
from
what
the
evidence
shows
here
about
great
salt
lake.
isn’t
it
where
you
have
erosion
on
one
side
of
a
bank
and
deposit
on
the
opposite
side
until
finally
the
thing
becomes
more
and
more
noticeable
and
you
ultimately
get
a
cut
off
of
an
(inaudible).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one
case
that
has
applied
the
doctrine
of
reliction
to
a
lake
i
guess
is
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
utah
in
the
hardy
case,
applying
at
the
great
salt
lake.
they
said
that
it
wasn’t
applicable.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you
said
that
because
of
bonelli,
you
haven’t
look
further
into
this
hardy
case
but
i
would
have
got
the
source
of
federal
common
law
if
that
be
what
governs
--
is
presumably
be
the
decisions
of
other
courts.
it
may
have
addressed
the
same
problem.
here,
you
have
a
finding
by
the
special
master
that
the
great
salt
lake
is
unique
and
the
conclusion
by
the
state
court
having
jurisdiction
over
that
lake,
that
because
of
that
fact,
reliction
doesn’t
apply.
i
would
think
in
formulation
of
federal
common
law,
we
would
play
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
that
hardy
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
realize
that
the
presumption
applies
in
the
cases
of
accretion
but
do
the
cases
support
you
in
saying
that
there’s
the
same
sort
of
presumption
where
you
are
arguing
for
reliction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
the
difference
between
may
and
october
in
one
particular
year
could
be
a
great
deal
difference
than
the
difference
between
may
1960
and
may
1970.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
difference,
seasonal
or
long
run?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what’s
your
answer
of
the
governments’
contention
that
there’s
a
presumption
that
a
change
in
boundary
occurred
by
reliction.
