if
the
union
had
agreed
with
the
multi-employer
bargaining
unit
to
attempt
to
use
its
best
efforts
to
get
these
kinds
of
agreements
from
one
unionized
general
contractors,
you
might
have
a
little
tougher
case
here,
i
suppose?
justice

of
course,
if
everything
might
be
different,
what
would
be
the
result
under
the
antitrust
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
might
be
perfectly
vulnerable
under
the
labor
law?
let's
assume
that
it
was
and
that
a
10
(l)
injunction
could
issue,
and
a
303
suit
could
be
sustained.
what
about
antitrust
liability?
justice

will
you
–
i
take
it
your
position
however
that
even
if
there
is
no
exemption
from
--
no
construction
industry
exemption
here
that
you'll
be
making
much
of
the
same
argument?
justice

r.

within
the
labor
act
exemption?
justice
byron
r.

congress
did
not
say
any
proviso
or
anywhere
in
the
act
that
anything
that
does
not
violate
the
labor
law
is
exempt
from
antitrust
liability?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
have
to
get
to
the
other
question
of
whether
it's
within
the
labor
exemption,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
inferences
are
you
doing
from
the
–
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
you
say
so,
or
did
it?
it
didn't
say
so.
