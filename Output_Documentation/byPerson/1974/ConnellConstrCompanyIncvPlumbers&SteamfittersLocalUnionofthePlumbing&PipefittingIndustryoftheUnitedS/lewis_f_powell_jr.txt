powell,

there
were
actually
two
contracts
involved
in
this
case,
weren't
there?
the
contract
in
issue
lay
between
the
union
and
the
members
of
the
association
that
engaged
in
the
multi-employer
contract
with
the
union.
and
the
second
contract
was
a
coerced
one
with
connell.
do
you
perceive
that
the
contractors
who
were
participants
in
the
multi-employer
contract,
derived
the
benefit
from
that
contract,
pursuant
to
which
the
union
agreed
that
in
affect
that
it
would
go
out
and
[inaudible]
it
actually
made
with
connell,
which
minimized
or
perhaps
eliminated
the
non-union
competition
that
these
contractors
otherwise
would
have
been
subjected
to?
justice

that
is
the
benefit
to
the
union

justice
lewis
f.
powell,

i
see
the
union's
interest
very
clearly.
i
was
directing
my
question
to
wherever
there
is
not
there
is
not
a
contractor's
interest
also
that
eliminate
competitor
contractors
who
are
not
unionized,
that
used

justice

powell,

this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
fifth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
a
general
contractor
in
a
construction
business
in
dallas.
the
respondent
is
a
labor
union
that
had
no
collective-bargaining
agreement
with
a
contractor.
but
the
union,
by
picketing
a
construction
project
of
the
contractor
was
deemed
to
agree
that
in
granting
subcontracts
for
plumbing
and
mechanical
work,
the
contractor
would
deal
only
with
subcontractors
who
had
collective-bargaining
agreements
with
the
union.
the
contractor
brought
this
action
to
annul
the
agreement
as
a
restraint
on
trade
under
both
the
federal
and
state
antitrust
laws.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
contractor
is
not
immune
from
federal
antitrust
laws.
we
remand
the
case
to
determine
whether
in
fact,
this
agreement
was
an
illegal
restraint
of
trade.
we
also
hold
that
state
antitrust
laws
are
preempted
by
federal
labor
policy.
