mr.
david
r.
richards
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
for
a
moment
like
to
define
what
we
think
to
be
the
issue
and
to
relatively
no
issue
before
the
court.
the
plaintiff's
complaint
alleges
only
sherman
act
and
state
law
violations.
no
contention
was
made
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
under
either
sections
301
or
303
in
the
trial
court
and
in
the
trial
court
the
only
claim
was,
as
is
characterized
in
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
that
connell
complained
because
the
contract
that
was
extracted
from
connell,
restricted
its
freedom
to
do
business,
that
is
his
freedom
to
choose
non-union
subcontractors
to
perform
his
mechanical
work.
as
i
understand
it
that's
the
issue
today.
this
contract
which
is
in
evidence
stands
alone
is
not
in
anyway
or
it's
stripped
of
any
allegations
the
union
employer
conspiracy.
the
testimony
at
the
trial
court,
the
findings
there
and
the
findings
in
the
fifth
circuit
characterize
it
as
no
allegation,
no
evidence
of
union-employer
conspiracy
beyond
that
which
connell
is
unhappy
about,
that
is
his
being
coming
an
unwilling
conspirator
to
what
he
deems
to
be
an
unlawful
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
union.
mr.
david
r.
richards
no
allen-bradley.
i
take
it
this
case
is,
the
contract
stands
alone,
unlike
allen-bradley
where
it
stood
as
part
of
a
much
broader
conspiracy
of
bilingual
product
marketing
as
well
as
the
labor
marketing.
mr.
david
r.
richards
none
at
all.
in
fact
connell's
president
or
one
of
the
connell's
witnesses
on
cross-examination
disclaimed
any
such
contention
and
that's
where
it
stands.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
as
i
understand
it,
that's
all.
that's
all
was
addressed
in
the
trial
court.
i
will
say
that
as
case
got
further
along,
the
issue
was
raised
in
the
circuit
court
level
about
the
most
favorite
nations
clause
but
i
don't
think
realistically
it's
not
in
the
case.
connell
does
not
claim
any
injury
by
virtue
of
the
one
time
existence
of
that
clause.
the
clause
now
no
longer
exists.
this
is
the
case
in
which
the
only
relief
sought
was
declaratory
and
injunctive.
hence,
i
suppose
to
the
extent
that
even
if
it
were
in
the
case
at
sometime,
it
has
become
i
would
suspect
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
no
damage
claims.
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
your
honor.
and
to
enjoin
or
make
attempts
to
secure
it
and
enforcement
it,
yes,
your
honor.
let
me
add
one
other
factual
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
the
injunction
against
the
picketing
in
the
state
court
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
yes,
your
honor
with
one
--
and
connell
at
the
point,
the
case
was
not
remanded.
then
under
protest
entered
the
proffered
agreement
and
then
amended
his
complaint
to
attack
the
agreement
which
he
was
then
a
part
to.
do
i
will
make
myself
clear?
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
am
glad
to
say
is
it
finally
when
you
need
well.
as
a
practical
matter
when
these
all
cases
were
not
going
back
to
state
court,
connell
ended
the
agreement.
mr.
david
r.
richards
entered
the
agreement,
then
challenged
it
under,
amended
his
complaint
to
challenge
it
under
the
sherman
act.
the
agreement
by
the
way
had
a
ten-day
cancellation
clause
on
part
of
either
party.
so
it
has
been
--
connell
has
had
the
power
ever
since
on
ten-days
notice
to
cancel
it.
mr.
david
r.
richards
he
was
clearly
coerced
into
the
agreement.
we
are
not
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
[attempt
to
laughter]
clearly,
he
was
coerced
into
the
agreement,
there
is
no
question
of
that.
mr.
david
r.
richards
exactly.
my
point
is
not
that
we
will
be
back
where
we
were,
that
is
no
agreement
and
be
in
dispute
once
we
are
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
we
would
be
back
where
we
were
and
perhaps
in
the
midst
of
the
dispute.
that's
correct,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
no
and
i
didn't
mean
it
imply
that
there
was.
i
simply
meant
that's
right,
we
would
be
back
where
we
were
before
the
union
demanding
the
agreement
threating
to
picket
for
it
and
connell
resisting
the
agreement.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that
certainly
would
have
affect
on
their
operations,
no
question
about
that.
there
would
be
a
very
strong
likelihood.
well
of
course,
that's
part
of
connell's
problem.
connell
is
caught
up
in
the
peculiarities
of
the
construction
industry.
connell
employs
unionized
iron
workers,
laborers,
carpenters.
he
chooses
to
from
time
to
time
subcontract
non-union
portions
of
his
work,
mechanical
contracting,
he
sub-contracts,
as
the
testimony
is,
sometimes
union,
sometime
non-union,
but
if
he
were
an
entirely
non-union
contractor,
of
course,
the
threat
of
local
100
to
picket
for
if
sub-contractor,
then
there
will
be
no
threat
at
all,
because
the
picketing
will
be
ignored
by
connell's
own
employees.
the
problem
connell
has
is
that
some
of
his
employees
opt
to
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
if
there
were
other
contractor
sites.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
problem
is
as
i
see
it
is
that
connell
is
caught
up
in
the
construction
industry
problems
of
common
site
and
again
reluctance
or
the
willingness
of
other
employees
at
the
site,
on
a
picket
line
or
that
is
not
worked
on
a
job
they
are
supposed
to.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that
was
not
the
contention,
no.
i
want
to
say
--
the
other
way
i
feel
our
general
contractors
who
do
on
occasion
some
of
there
own
mechanical
contracting
work,
but
that
is
not
the
pattern
in
industry
and
connell
was
not
one
of
those.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
the
fact
of
life
is,
that
in
the
past
if
non-union
sub-contractors
appeared
at
a
project,
local
100
would
picket
the
non-union
sub-contractor
and
that
would
frequently
shut
down
the
project,
that's
exactly
right.
this
agreement
is
addressed
to
the
future
to
avoid
just
that
problem
by
trying
to
extract
a
promise
from
connell
that
in
the
future
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
exactly.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
that's
correct
this
union,
but
there
is
one
other
fact
of
life,
i
guess,
in
the
construction
industry
that
is
that
trade
pass
lines
which
as
far
as
i
am
aware
this
is
the
only
union
that
claims
jurisdiction
in
the
dallas
area
for
performing
plumbing
and
steam-fitting
work.
this
is
just
the
nature
of
the
beast.
there
is
no
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
there
is
no
competing
union
vying
for
this
representation
because
that's
the
nature
of
industry.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
it
makes
some
difference
as
far
as
the
labor
board.
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
in
antitrust
context
which
is
what
we
are
here
with.
we
say
several
things
in
our
defense.
we
first
of
course
say
that
it
is
simply
not
a
antitrust
case
that
it
is
to
be
judged
within
the
framework
of
the
labor
statute.
we
do
say
that
the
agreement
we
seek
is
protected
by
the
proviso
to
8
(e),
the
construction
industry
proviso
and
we
understand
i
think
and
everyone
seems
to
concede
that
if,
i
am
not
sure
now,
but
i
had
thought
that
everyone
conceded
that
if
congress
had
in
fact
authorized
the
agreement
that
we
obtained
that,
that
would
be,
at
least
in
this
context,
a
complete
antitrust
contention,
because
the
agreement
stands
alone
unembellished
within
the
other
broader
conspiracy.
mr.
david
r.
richards
we
have
said
mr.
david
r.
richards
we
do
say
that
this
dispute
is
totally
invalid
by
the
provisions
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
of
the
act
which
either
protects
it
or
prohibits
it.
there
has
been
--
i
did
want
to
say
if
connell
urged
that
there
been
the
no
labor
board
decision
on
the
point,
a
case
was
just
decided
last
week,
which
i
want
to
call
to
court's
attention
and
seek
permission
to
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
formally
tender
it.
it's
another
los
angeles
building
&
construction
trades
council
case
which
comes
--
which
has
been
a
source
of
most
litigation
in
the
field.
214
nlrb
no.
86,
released
on
november
7.
here,
probably
the
proper
thing
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
it's
not
yet
in
the
services.
i
should
reproduce
sufficient
copies.
i
can
do
that
and
leave
them
with
the
clerk.
the
la
building
trades
case
is
another
one
of
the
variance
in
the
construction
industry.
here
the
contractor,
the
general
contractor
had
really
become
purely
a
broker.
the
facts
are
he
had
no
employees
at
all
of
any
kind.
no
collected
bargaining
contract
of
any
kind
and
never
had
had
any.
what
he
did,
this
particular
general
contractor,
was
simply
acquired
the
general
contract
and
then
sub-contracted
all
the
site
work.
he
was
picketed
for
the
standard
la
building
trades
agreement
which
has
been
subject
of
much
litigation
in
the
field.
the
board
finds
no
violation,
noting
specifically
that
when
the
la
building
trades
demanded
the
standard
form
subcontracting
agreement
and
the
general
contractor
refused
that
they
then
became
involved
in
a
labor
dispute
and
which
is
a
primary
labor
dispute,
because
then
the
counsel
proceeded
to
picket
for
their
standard
agreement,
the
complaint
issued
and
now
the
nlrb
has
dismissed
the
complaint,
no
violation.
as
i
say,
(inaudible)
i
guess,
again
the
kind
of
patterns
that
exist
in
this
industry
and
why
i
suppose
congress
did
choose
to
create
special
provisions
for
it.
i
want
to
make
at
least
another
point
or
two
with
respect
to
the
proviso
and
specifically
counsel's
contention
that
somehow
we
are
indirectly
overruling
denver
building
trades.
as
we
understand
what
congress
did
in
the
two
provisos
that
were
carved
out
of
8
(e)
the
garment
industry
proviso
and
the
building
trade
proviso.
in
the
garment
industry
proviso
--
i
should
say
it
the
other
way,
the
denver
building
trades
rationale
is
preserved
in
the
building
trades
proviso.
that
is
because
agreements
of
this
nature
cannot
be
enforced
by
coercion,
that
is
by
picketing
strikes
or
threats
of
strikes.
an
agreement
such
as
we
have
with
connell
can
only
be
enforced
by
a
judicial
action,
by
going
to
court,
suing
to
enforce
it,
whereas
in
the
garment
industry,
i
guess,
because
again
a
recognition
of
peculiarity
is
there,
the
garment
workers
were
given
the
right
to
enforce
their
in
effect
no
subcontracting
agreements
by
coercion.
there
is
we
cited
in
our
brief
a
recent
decision
of
the
second
circuit
by
judge
friendly
on
facts
which
are
indistinguishable
as
far
as
the
garment
industry,
the
same
pattern
that
is
a
garment
union
goes
to
a
manufacturer
and
says
we
want
an
agreement
with
you
that
you
will
not
subcontract
any
of
your
work
to
anybody,
but
unionized
garment
manufacturers.
we
don't
want
to
recognition
for
any
of
your
employees,
don't
want
to
bargain
for
them.
judge
friendly
finds
it
within
the
proviso
protected,
the
board
has
now
founded
within
the
proviso
as
protected.
mr.
david
r.
richards
in
the
official
obtaining
of
the
agreement,
i
meant
to
say.
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
took
the
form
of
picketing
by
local
100
to
secure
this
agreement.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
am
sorry.
the
[attempt
to
laughter]
distinction
is,
the
better
or
worst
distinction
is
that
such
agreements
maybe
obtained
by
coercion,
but
may
not
be
enforced
by
coercion
in
the
building
trades
industry.
in
the
garment
industry
they
maybe
both
obtained
and
enforced.
now
i
should
go
on
to
say,
that
this
court
has
not
said
that,
that's
what
each
of
the
circuit
courts
have
said
that
have
dealt
with
the
question,
that
coercion
to
obtain
the
construction
industry
agreement
is
protected;
to
enforce
it
is
not.
mr.
david
r.
richards
local
100
in
this
instance
wanted
to
enforce
this
agreement.
i
suppose
they
would
have
to
file
suit
under
301
either
in
state
or
federal
court
to
secure
injunctive
relief
to
compel
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
exactly.
if
the
conduct
here
of
local
100
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act.
obviously,
the
powers
in
the
board
under
10
(l)
to
secure
injunction
swiftly
and
promptly
against
picketing.
mr.
david
r.
richards
and
connell
will
have
a
resulting
303
damage
action
for
any
injuries
that
he
suffers
as
a
consequence.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
don't
know.
i
do
not
think
so.
i
don't
think
the
parallel
is
there,
in
fact
it's
our
view
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
am
not
sure
if
i
want
to
say
--
i
do
want
to
say
that
clearly
in
our
view
the
determination
of
sherman
act
violation
doesn't
turn
upon
whether
or
not
it's
protected
or
prohibited
by
taft-hartley.
specifically,
certainly
that's
true
with
respect
to
secondary
boycott
provisions
which
congress
adopted
in
1947
after
extensive
debate
on
whether
to
re-institute
antitrust
remedies
for
secondary
boycotts
after
--
we
have
said
that
the
history
out
at
length
in
our
brief,
but
finally
on
the
floor
of
the
senate,
senator
taft
announces
that
he
is
abandoning
his
effort
to
re-institute
sherman
act
remedies
for
secondary
boycott
violations,
but
rather
as
a
compromise
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
inserting
or
going
to
offer
section
303.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i'm
sorry.
i
must
have
misspoke
myself.
it
seems
for
these
facts,
this
case,
the
exclusive
remedy
is
that
which
congress
created
in
1947,
i
presume
and
that's
the
(inaudilbe)
injunction
at
the
instance
of
the
labor
board
and
the
303
damage
action.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that's
the
clear
message,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
congressional
history
of
the
statute.
that
seems
an
escape
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
on
the
facts
this
case,
yes.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
it's
conceivable
to
me
if
you
are
dealing
with
this
as
one
part
of
broader
overall
allen-bradley
kind
of
conspiracy,
you
would
have
the
kind
of
case
in
which
there
could
perhaps
involve
antitrust
action,
but
that
is
not
what
we
are
dealing
with.
we
are
dealing
with
this
as
a
naked
agreement
standing
alone,
and
yes
i
think
nlrb
remedies
of
injunctive
relief
and
and
damages,
actual
damages
is
exclusive
if
there
is
a
violation
here.
mr.
david
r.
richards
no,
of
course
not
as
to
any
conceivable
violation,
i
do
not.
this
position
is
asserted
i
think
by
the
solicitor
in
support
of
the
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
if
this
case
was
embellished
with
any
claim
of
a
conspiracy
or
predatory
purpose,
it
would
be
a
different
case.
it's
not
that
case.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well,
i
suppose
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
cannot
exclude
the
possibility
that
a
fact
situation
could
exist
that
involved
this
agreement
law
with
other
aspects
which
would
give
rise
to
antitrust
violation.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
would,
i
cannot
exclude
the
universe.
i
do
say
that
this
kind
of
contract
contemplated
by
congress
to
be
either
law
under
8
(e)
or
unlawful
carries
with
it,
by
congressional
mandate
the
sole
remedy
for
a
violation
there.
and
that
the
violation
of
8
(b)
(4)
(a)
does
not
give
rise
to
the
sherman
act,
corollary
violation.
i
think
congress
specifically
went
the
other
direction
in
1947.
i
think
they
reaffirmed
it
1959
when
the
same
debates
were
again
at
hand
about
re-institution
of
the
sherman
act
violations
for
certain
kinds
of
secondary
boycott.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
do
not
–
my
own
view
of
it
is
connell
would
not
be
a
position
to
complain
about
it.
i
think
the
mechanical
contractor
in
dallas
who
said
i
would
like
to
compete.
i
cannot
compete
because
what
has
been
extracted
for
me
as
a
consequence
of
a
promise
to
others;
that
kind
of
case
might
very
well
present
--
would
might
very
well
raise
real
problems
it
would
seem
to
me,
but
that
person
has
not
come
to
court
and
there
are
no
facts
suggesting
that
that's
present
in
this
case.
yes
sir?
mr.
david
r.
richards
well
first
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
in
this
record.
i
think
the
benefit,
if
any
has
been
derived,
i
am
not
sure
that
any
has
at
this
point,
would
have
been
to
increase
the
work
opportunities
of
members
of
local
union
100
and
to
preserve
their
wages
from
being
eroded
by
non-union
competition
in
the
dallas
area.
mr.
david
r.
richards
that
is
the
direct
benefit
and
that
is
what
we
were
dealing
with
here.
i
am
not
at
all
–
well,
actually
this
is
--
and
i
would
say
no
i
do
not
see
any
significant
or
even
as
i
see
it
potential
benefit
if
you
were
to
follow
the
argument
of
connell.
they
say
if
we
are
successful
that
means
all
the
contractors
will
be
union
contractors.
of
course,
that
is
what
we
obviously
want.
we
want
everybody
be
a
union
contractor.
if
we
were
forbid
--
if
we
were
foreclosing
from
that
status
any
mechanical
contractor
that
might
present
a
different
kind
of
problem,
but
we
are
not
doing
that.
we
are
actively
in
fact
trying
to
organize
the
one
non-union
contractor
whose
name
crept
into
this
case,
texas
distributors.
we
have
not
been
successful
in
doing
it.
if
he
is
feeling
pinched
by
this
agreement,
we
welcome
with
open
arms,
he
can
compete
on
same
basis
is
all
loaded
contractors
that
is
not
undercutting
our
union
wages
and
conditions.
mr.
david
r.
richards
well
there
is
no
suggestion
that
we
were
trying
to
create
a
monopoly
for
that
favored
group
in
this
record;
and
that
was
the
nature
of
the
contention.
i
suppose
it
would
be
foolish
to
say
that
its
not
conceivable
if
there
were
some
spin
off
benefit.
there
is
always
to
make
that
argument.
it
seems
me
the
argument
is
it's
a
direct
benefit
for
us;
one
if
we
are
--
it's
our
reason
for
being
that
is
to
protect
the
wages
of
our
members,
and
to
increase
the
work
opportunities
and,
we
are
appropriately
prepared
to
well
community
non-union
contractor
who
wants
to
share
in
giving
his
employees
those
benefits.
i
am
not
sure
i
have
any
more
time
--
i
wanted
to
say
one
of
things,
it
seems
about
the
nature
of
the
argument
made
by
the
antitrust,
argument
made
connell
and
that
is
it
seems
to
what
they
really
are
trying
to
do
is
resurrect
the
primary
secondary
dichotomy
as
an
antitrust
determinant.
i
think
what
their
reply
brief
says
specifically
that
is
the
absence
of
the
employer,
employee
relationship
between
local
100
and
connell
that
gives
rise
to
antitrust
complications,
but
that
precisely
what,
we
did
away
with
i
assume
in
norris-laguardia
and
what
this
court
has
said,
each
time
since
then,
or
since
hutcheson
that
it
is
no
longer
relevant
in
the
antitrust
determination.
the
interest
of
local
100
is
clear.
connell
is
the
person
who
makes
the
decision
about
whether
its
members
are
going
to
get
to
work
or
not.
they
can
organize
and
organize
as
long
as
general
contractors
would
not
contract
with
unionized
mechanical
contractors,
they
have
no
work.
and
as
i
say
putting
back
in
focus
for
me
at
least,
their
argument,
connell's
argument
is
a
redefinition
of
the
term
labor
dispute
in
norris-laguardia
and
a
redefinition
of
the
term
labor
dispute
which
is
identical
in
the
labor
act
to
insist
once
again
that
there
most
be
a
proximate
relationship
between
the
dispute
of
employers
employee,
is
essentially
what
they
are
saying
to
us.
and
stated
on
the
other
side
of
it,
i
can
see
--
the
chamber
of
commerce
has
filed
the
brief
here
in
support
of
connell
which
it
says
it
would
be
perfectly
lawful
for
the
carpenters
union
to
enter
a
contract
with
connell
saying
that
connell
would
not
subcontract
any
work
of
any
kind,
plumbers
work,
electricians
work
through
any
but
union
contractors
and
that,
that
would
be
protected.
i
fail
to
see
any
significant
difference
in
terms
to
add
a
competitive
affect,
if
you
were
looking
at
for
sherman
act
point
of
view,
of
that
agreement
which
they
concede
to
be
lawful
and
ours
which
they
attack.
in
fact,
i
think
ours
is
really
more
relevant
to
the
needs
of
the
people
involved,
that
is
the
plumbers
local
is
looking
for
its
members'
jobs
and
wages
and
yet
the
agreements
that
they
would
concede
to
be
lawful
seem
to
me
have
just
as
much,
if
not
more
danger
of
anti
competitive
effect.
it
is
not
accurate
to
state
that
in
1959,
congress
decided
that
it
would
be
unlawful
for
8
(e)
agreements
to
be
attained
by
coercion.
quite
the
contrary,
and
we
didn't
cite
in
our
brief
although
we
had
should
have,
a
post-legislative
history
by
senator
goldwater
is
explicit
that
this
question
of
coercion
to
obtain
construction
industry
agreements
was
one
that
congress
left
unresolved
intentionally
in
adopting
8
(e).
the
courts,
the
five
circuits
i
believe
now
that
have
faced
the
question
as
well
as
a
labor
board
and
uniformly
said
that
picketing
to
obtain
such
agreements
is
lawful
in
the
construction
industry.
historically
this
record
contains
testimony
from
the
los
angeles
building
&
construction
trades.
the
la
building
trades
had
sought
and
obtained
the
agreements
of
this
kind,
much
like
the
one
that
i
referred
in
the
current
board
case,
back
before
taft-hartley,
that
was
the
pattern.
the
building
trade's
council
is
not
a
bargaining
agent.
the
bargaining
agents
are
the
various
craft
unions;
and
yet
building
trade
agreements
of
this
kind
predate,
taft-hartley,
that's
record
evidence
in
this
case.
the
la
building
trades
agreement
has
been
before
the
nlrb
in
a
number
of
cases.
church's
fried
chicken
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
most
recent
case
which
i
have
just
mentioned
to
you.
looking
back
at
old
antitrust
doctrines
frankly
i
cannot
see
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
teamsters
--
milkwagon
drivers
v.
lake
valley.
in
lake
valley
the
dairy
drivers
think
they
are
being
threatened
by
a
system
of
vending
milk
in
chicago.
so
they
go
put
economic
pressure
on
retail
outlets
and
say
do
not
buy,
by
picketing,
threats
and
coercion,
do
not
buy
any
longer
from
these
dairies.
when
they
acquiesced,
they
take
the
pressure
of
and
that
has
been
no
antitrust.
a
second
circuit
case
belaboring
in
griggs,
ones
which
was
here
at
one
point
supreme
court
where
the
iron
workers
union
in
new
york
threaten
by
what
was
called
the
iron
league
a
non-union
open
shop,
iron
worker
erections
companies
went
to
owner's
contract,
general
contractors,
architects,
threaten
labor
difficulties,
if
they
did
not
agree
not
to
use,
non-union
iron
working
firms
in
the
future.
and
this
is
just
what
--
this
is
the
typical
pattern,
that
has
emerged
in
this
industry,
one
which
has
been
traditionally
sought
--
traditionally
thought
to
be
exempt
from
antitrust
which
congress
we
think
in
specifically
addressing
itself
to
the
problem
of
this
industry
in
1947
and
in
1959
made
the
conscious
choice,
that
what
is
evil
here,
we
are
going
to
define
with
precision.
and
it
did
define
with
precision
as
well
as
the
evil
as
well
as
a
remedy
specifically
rejecting
the
arguments
that
antitrust
sanctions
should
somehow
be
employed
here
to
remedy
the
secondary
boycott
which
were
--
took
by
construction
industry.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
would
make
this
--
i
would
make
argument
that
this
agreement
does
not
violate
antitrust
even
in
absence
of
8
(e)
--
mr.
david
r.
richards
exactly
of
course,
because
it
is
addressed
on
to
the
immediate
concern
of
a
local
union
in
their
interest
in
preserving
jobs,
and
preserving
the
wages.
and
irrespective
of
the
presence
of
the
8
(e)
proviso
would
be
within
the
exemption.
i
am
simply
saying
that
the
presence
of
the
8
(e)
proviso
makes
it
unnecessary,
i
think
to
reach
the
question.
mr.
david
r.
richards
they
did
not
say
–-
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
do
think
–
we
would
say
that
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
consciously
chose
a
specific
remedy
for
this
kind
of
action
and
said
we
are
rejecting
antitrust,
we
are
rejecting
injunction
at
the
instance
of
the
private
parties.
we
are
giving
it
to
the
board.
we
are
rejecting
treble
damages.
we
are
giving
only
compensatory
damages.
mr.
david
r.
richards
i
think
it
is
–
sure
inescapable
–
mr.
david
r.
richards
it
didn't
say
so
precisely.
