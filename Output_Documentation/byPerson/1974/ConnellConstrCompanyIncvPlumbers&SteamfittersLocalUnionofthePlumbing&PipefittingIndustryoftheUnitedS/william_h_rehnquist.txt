justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
this
--
that
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
there
was
no
doubt
of
the
coercion
involved
here
as
against
connell?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
form
was
the
coercion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
i
thought
you
said
a
minute
ago
and
perhaps
i
misunderstand
to
say
that
the
8
(e)
doesn't
allow
that
sort
of
picketing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
then
of
there
is
any
remedy
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
against
the
union
for
its
conduct,
the
fact
that
such
a
remedy
exists
under
the
national
labor
relation
act,
precludes
a
remedy
under
the
antitrust
act
across
the
board?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
meant
to
the
facts
of
this
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
take
that
position
categorically
with
respect
to
any
conceivable
violation?
