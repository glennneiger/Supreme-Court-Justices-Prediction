mr.
canterbury,
when
you
say
they
made
a
employer-employee
relationship,
do
i
understand
you
to
mean
that
it
was
intended
that
under
the
proviso,
the
first
proviso,
section
8
(e)
that
such
an
agreement
would
be
exempt
from
the
language
of
8
(e),
only
if
the
union
that
was
making
the
agreement
was
the
bargaining
representative
of
employees
with
the
contractor
with
whom
it
was
making
the
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
what
you
mean
here?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
is
no
allegation,
in
other
words,
in
the
complaint
that
the
union
employers
and
the
union
have
conspired
to
gang
up
on
connell?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
purely
a
complaint
by
connell
on
disagreement
that
was
foisted
on
him
by
the
union?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i
am
sorry.
this
case
originally
began
in
the
state
court?
justice
potter
stewart
under
the
state
antitrust
law
and
then
you
removed
it
to
the
federal
court
and
then
the
federal
court
declined
it
and
sent
it
back
to
state
court
and
then
the
complaint
was
amended
to
add
a
count
of
federal
antitrust
law,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
entered
the
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
of
course
his
claim
is
he
was
coerced
into
the
agreement?
justice
potter
stewart
if
he
is
right,
i
suppose
he
would
be
coerced
into
not
rescinding
it,
isn't
that
right?
