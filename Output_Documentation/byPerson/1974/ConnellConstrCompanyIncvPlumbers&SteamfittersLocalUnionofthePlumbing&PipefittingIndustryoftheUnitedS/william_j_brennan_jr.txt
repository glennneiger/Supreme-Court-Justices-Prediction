justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
canterbury
i
gather,
it's
not
just
a
contract
between
an
employer
and
the
union,
it's
a
contract
between
an
employer
and
the
union
and
the
construction
industry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
is
special
statutory
provisions
of
government
contracts
of
that
kind,
don't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
you
have
to
deal
with
that
concern?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
general
counsel
has
said
why
he
doesn't
file
complaints,
hasn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
says
that
8
(e)
was
intended
to
preserve
the
status
quo
of
the
constructions
industry?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
thought
you
said
earlier,
perhaps
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
said
the
general
counsel
has
never
explained
why
it
is
he
wouldn't
issue
complaints
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
sorry.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
mean
by
that
mr.
richards
there
is
no
allen-bradley
kind?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
declaratory
and
injunctive,
mr.
richards,
you
mean
by
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
damage
claim,
just
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
richards
the
fact
of
life
is
that
if
he
brought
a
non-union
sub-contractor
on
the
site,
the
whole
project
would
shut
down.
that's
the
fact
of
life,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
union
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
over
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
mr.
richards,
really
what
you
say
this
is
something
exclusively
for
the
cognizance
of
the
national
labor
relations
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
dispute
is
--
and
that
if
it
is
arguably
that,
that
precludes
any
antitrust
or
any
other,
and
if
the
board
were
to
find
that
in
some
respects
you
were
not
protected
by
the
proviso,
then
the
board
has
to
pursue
its
remedies
which
are,
as
i
would
call
it
injunction
or
connell
has
a
303
action
for
damages.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
said
you
seek
to
enforce
it
by
whom,
brought
by
whom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
to
be
distinguished
from
the
nlrb
suit
where
there
has
been
a
violation
found,
where
there
has
been
no
protection
of
the
proviso,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
that
circumstance
connell
will
have
a
303
action
against
--
?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
it
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act,
it
would
also
lose
its
defense
under
the
antitrust
act,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
exclusive
remedy
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
like
to
get
this
--
your
decision
clear
about
this
mr.
richards.
if
this
is
nlrb
predecessor
as
to
whether
the
proviso
protects
this
particular
party
and
the
board
would
have
concluded
that
it
did
not.
now
do
you
suggest
that
the
sanctions
of
antitrust
may
still
be
available
or
that
either
the
board
sanction
of
injunction
coupled
with
a
303
sanction
of
the
employer
for
the
damages
is
a
exclusive
remedy
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
intended
thereby
to
exclude
any
antitrust
sanctions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
richard
do
you
have
a
antitrust
problem
here
if
the
favored
nation
clause
were
in
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
73-1256,
connell
construction
company
versus
steamfitters
local
no.
100
will
be
delivered
by
mr.
justice
powell.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
justice
powell.
