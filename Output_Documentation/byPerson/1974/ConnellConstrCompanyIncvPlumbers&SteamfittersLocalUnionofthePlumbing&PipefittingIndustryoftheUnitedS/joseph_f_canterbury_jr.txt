mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors,
this
case
involves
the
antitrust
issues
involved
in
an
agreement
between
a
plumbers
union
and
a
general
contractor
in
dallas,
texas,
whereby
the
general
contractor
has
been
coerced
into
an
agreement
that
he
will
refuse
to
do
business
with
and
will
boycott
all
subcontractors
for
mechanical
work
unless
so
subcontractors
in
turn
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
the
union.
your
honors,
this
case
involves
no
manner
an
employer-employee
relationship.
the
petitioner
in
the
case,
connell
construction
company,
does
not
have
or
never
has
had
a
single
employee
represented
by
the
respondent
union.
the
district
court
below
did
not
decide
the
antitrust
issues
in
the
agreement
but
held
that
the
proviso
to
section
8
(e)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
protected
the
agreement.
the
fifth
circuit
in
turn
found
that
the
union's
actions
were
antitrust
exempt,
but
failed
to
decide
any
of
the
labor
questions.
the
union
filed
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
agreement
was
protected
by
the
construction
industry
proviso
to
section
8
(e)
of
the
labor
act.
i
would
point
out
your
honors
that
the
fifth
circuit
in
very
strong
words
admonished
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
decide
the
labor
issues
involved
in
the
case
at
the
next
available
opportunity
which
has
not
been
done
even
though
the
board
in
this
case
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
where
they
admit
that
the
issue
of
the
construction
industry
proviso
to
section
8
(e)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
has
never
been
decided
by
the
board,
outside
of
an
employer-employee
relationship.
the
facts
quickly
are
that
connell
construction
company
is
a
general
contractor
and
the
construction
done
is
in
dallas,
texas.
connell
obtains
its
work
by
competitive
bidding.
connell
in
turn
sub
contracts
mechanical
work
by
competitive
bidding.
connell
is
involved
in
interstate
commerce.
the
mechanical
portion
of
any
construction
project,
an
equal
to
40-50%
of
the
project
indeed
on
power
plants,
generating
plants
it
can
equal
more
than
that,
mechanical
construction
normally
includes
all
of
the
piping,
heating,
ventilation,
air-conditioning
and
plumbing,
in
fact
in
some
of
our
very
sophisticated
air-conditioning
system,
that
even
includes
computers,
includes
a
major
portion
of
any
construction
project.
the
union
respondent
in
the
december
of
1970,
sent
a
letter
to
connell
saying,
“we
want
you
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
us
that
you
will
refuse
to
do
business,”
i
am
paraphrasing
the
agreement.
“you
will
not
do
business
with
any
mechanical
subcontractor
unless
they
have
an
agreement
with
us,
a
collective
bargain
agreement.”
mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
no
your
honor,
not
at
all.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
record
shows
that
over
the
past
23
years,
connell
has
on
a
recurring
basis,
done
business
with
both
union
and
open-shop
mechanical
contractors.
in
fact
at
the
time
that
the
union
sent
the
letter
and
the
agreement
and
subsequently
started
picketing
for
the
agreement,
connell
indeed
had
a
union
contractor
who
had
a
collective
bargain
agreement
with
the
union
on
the
job.
the
record
clearly
shows
that
connell
up
until
this
time
did
not
care
what
the
labor
policy
of
the
subcontractors
were.
he
admittedly
is
in
a
competitive
business,
and
he
looks
for
competitive
bids
from
qualified
contractors
and
when
the
after
connell
failed
to
sign
the
agreement
the
union
commenced
picketing
about
one
of
connell's
projects
where
there
was
a
union
subcontractor,
about
a
150
man
ordered
to
picket
line
brought
construction
to
a
halt.
connell
filed
an
action
in
the
state
court
in
texas
alleging
that
the
agreement
was
violative
of
the
antitrust
laws,
at
the
state
of
texas,
a
restraining
order
was
issued,
the
case
was
removed
to
federal
court
at
which
time
connell
amended
its
pleadings
and
alleged
not
only
it
violated
the
antitrust
laws
of
texas,
but
also
the
sherman
act.
your
honors,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
union
has
been
a
party
and
has
been
caused
a
violation
of
sherman
act
will
turn
upon
the
extent
of
the
union's
immunity
from
the
labor
laws.
i
think
if
we
can
look
at
the
agreement
on
its
face,
the
agreement
on
its
face
is
simply
an
agreement
between
two
parties,
a
union
and
a
non-labor
party
connell,
whereby
agreement
is
reached
that,
connell
will
not
do
business
with
other
people
not
just
one
subcontractor,
but
every
mechanical
contractor
from
dallas
to
the
oklahoma
border
who
does
not
have
a
collective
bargain
agreement
with
the
union
for
any
reason.
the
union
did
not
seek
to
protect
wages,
working
conditions.
the
evidence
shows
nothing
as
to
what
open-shop
or
non-union
subcontractors
paid
their
employees.
mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
your
honor,
you
are
referring
to
the
proviso
to
section
8
(e)
of
the
labor
act.
mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
yes,
i
would
deal
with
that
your
honor,
i
certainly
will.
but
on
the
face
of
the
agreement
on
it's
face,
it's
clearly
a
restrain
of
trade,
clearly
violates
the
sherman
act
unless
the
union
is
exempted.
now,
let's
look
as
to
whether
or
not
the
union's
actions
are
exempt.
i
am
well
aware
and
we
all
are
of
course
of
the
the
norris-laguardia
act
and
the
clayton
act
and
the
exemptions
which
they
grant
to
unions
for
certain
activities,
not
all
from
the
antitrust
laws.
the
first
theory
is
the
conspiracy
theory.
it's
been
held
from
allan
bradley
and
numerous
cases
since
then,
that
if
a
union
conspires
with
a
non-labor
group
or
source
to
restrain
trade,
then
there
is
like
anyone
else,
it's
just
like
two
businessmen,
if
they
enter
into
an
agreement
to
restrain
trade,
if
the
union
enters
into
a
conspiracy.
your
honor,
the
conspiracy
in
this
case
is
two-fold
and
i
must
step
back
into
the
facts
at
one
important
point.
prior
to
the
time
that
the
union
came
to
the
connell,
they
entered
into
a
multi
employer
agreement
with
the
largest
union
as
mechanical
contractors
in
the
dallas
area.
that
agreement
contained
a
favorite
nation's
clause
which
prohibited
the
union
from
giving
any
employer,
any
better
terms
or
conditions
than
was
contained
in
the
multi
employer
group
in
that
contract.
the
business
agent
at
the
trial
of
the
case
testified,
i
asked
him,
“suppose
connell
wanted
to
do
business
with
a
subcontractor,
a
mechanical
contractor
who
is
not
a
party
to
your
collective
bargain
agreement,
could
that
mechanical
contract
coming
and
negotiate
one?
business
agent
says,
no
you
can
only
sign
our
established
agreement,
that's
the
only
agreement
someone
can
sign.”
now
the
union,
since
this
case
was
argued
at
the
fifth
circuit,
the
union
has
dropped
its
favorite
nation's
clause
from
its
master
agreement.
i
submit
that
the
facts
are
still
the
same
that
the
union
only
has
one
form
of
collective
bargain
agreement,
that's
the
master
area
agreement.
now
who
were
the
benefactors
of
this
conspiracy?
connell
is
a
conspirator.
he
is
an
unwilling
conspirator
clearly
unwilling,
but
the
benefactors
of
the
mechanical
contractors
who
are
a
party
to
the
union's
collective
bargain
agreement,
the
master
area
agreement.
if
connell
is
restricted,
and
connell
is
just
one
contractor
of
meeting
in
the
area,
if
general
contractors
are
restricted
from
subcontracting
out
work
to
open-shop
mechanicals,
of
course,
the
union
mechanicals
are
the
benefactors.
i
believe
that
indeed
a
conspiracy
by
the
union
first
making
this
agreement
with
the
unionized
contractors
and
then
come
into
connell
and
insisting
that
connell
place
all
those
with
whom
he
does
business
under
the
same
agreement,
but
that
is
a
conspiracy,
connell
is
a
link.
connell
and
other
general
contractors
or
the
method
in
which
it's
transmitted
but
even
beyond
that
connell,
even
though
he
doesn't
get
a
bit
of
benefit
and
although
he
is
an
unwilling
conspirator,
he
is
a
non-labor
party
and
the
agreement
clearly
restrains
trade
outside
of
any
employer-employer
relationship.
i
believe
that
even
if
there
is
no
conspiracy,
we
must
look
to
see
whether
or
not
that
the
union
and
whether
or
not
this
agreement
fosters
a
legitimate
union
interest.
this
court's
decision
in
jewel
tea
clearly
held
that
even
if
there
is
no
conspiracy
and
if
a
labor-management
agreement
involves
restrains
of
trade
inquiry
does
not
start
with
conspiracy.
you
look
at
the
agreement,
you
look
at
the
effects
and
you
compare
it
with
national
labor
policy.
indeed
your
honors
from
as
far
back
as
the
danbury
hatters
case,
hutcheson,
apex,
allen
bradley,
every
labor
anti
trust
case
which
has
come
before
this
court,
the
agreement
that
is
found
in
restrain
of
trade
has
been
compared
against
national
labor
policy
and
i
think
that's
what
must
be
done
in
this
case.
the
agreement
must
be
compared
against
the
national
labor
policy
which
is
primarily
found
in
the
taft-hartley
act.
even
harder
and
one
that
i
accept
is
the
norris-laguardia
act.
i
believe
comparing
the
agreement
with
the
norris-laguardia
act
itself
shows
that
this
type
of
an
agreement
is
not
legitimate
labor
activity.
the
norris-laguardia
act
talks
in
terms
of
fostering
collective
bargaining,
fostering
the
rights
of
employees.
the
taft-hartley
act
in
47,
the
entire
preamble
of
the
act
is
to
foster
collective
bargaining
and
for
employees
to
be
free
to
choose
their
own
representatives.
the
act
does
not
favor
unionism,
nor
non
unionism.
it
doesn't
favor
unions
or
employers.
the
act
favors
the
rights
of
the
employees
to
select.
let's
look
at
what
this
agreement
and
what
the
effects
of
it
do
to
first
connell.
union
has
no
dispute
with
connell.
the
letter
they
sent
to
connell
seeking
this
agreement
said,
we
don't
want
to
represent
a
single
one
of
your
employees.
they
have
no
dispute
whatsoever
with
connell.
their
dispute,
alleged
dispute
is
with
open-shop
mechanical
contractors
which
connell
didn't
have
at
the
time
of
this
whole
--
all
of
this
picketing
started.
when
they
went
to
picket
the
project,
connell
being
a
neutral
employer,
that
was
a
clear
cut
secondary
boycott,
clearly.
further,
he
is
being
enmeshed
in
a
dispute
that
is
not
his,
and
that's
what
the
whole
purpose,
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
our
labor
act
has
been
is
to
protect
neutral
employers.
let's
look
at
the
section
7
rights
of
the
employees
of
the
mechanical
construction
firms
with
whom
connell
must
boycott.
where
their
rights
lie?
section
7
of
the
taft-hartley
act
says
that
the
right
to
choose
our
own
representatives
to
bargain
collectively
the
representatives
of
their
own
choosing
to
engage
in
protected
activities
are
to
refrain
from
union
activities.
let's
look
at
these
employees,
what
rights
do
they
have?
they
have
none
at
all.
as
this
type
of
an
agreement
that
is
involved
in
this
case
becomes
broader
and
broader,
they
have
no
choice,
their
employer
must
sign
up
with
the
respondent
union
or
go
out
of
business.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
if
they
voted
for
another
union,
if
they
voted
against
a
union
or
if
they
just
don't
want
to
belong
a
union.
they
don't
have
a
thing
to
say
about
it
because
the
local
union
controls
the
construction
market.
either
you
sign
up
with
them
or
you
don't
get
work
because
if
the
general
contractors
who
award
the
work
are
unable
to
subcontract,
then
they
get
no
work.
those
rights
are
obliterated.
section
9
of
the
act
gives
the
employers
a
right
to
an
election.
they
have
no
rights
to
an
election.
i
submit
and
it's
set
forth
in
our
briefs
your
honor
that
if
you
compare
this
agreement
to
the
labor
act,
you
will
find
that
indeed
it
is
violative
of
numerous
provisions
of
the
act
and
against
just
main
purposes
to
foster
collective
bargaining.
let's
look
at
that
and
go
back,
is
this
a
legitimate
union
interest?
is
it
a
legitimate
union
interest
outside
of
the
employer-employee
relationship
to
force
a
boycott
of
the
proportions
which
has
been
involved
in
this
case?
i
submit
that
it's
not.
there
is
no
way,
this
agreement
when
compared
with
the
taft-hartley
act
can
measure
up
to
be
legitimate.
now
it
is
always
anything
that
a
union
does
for
its
members
or
that
benefits
its
members,
i
am
sure
they
were
categorized
as
a
legitimate
union
interest.
i
submit,
let's
look
at
how
they
achieve
it.
the
taft-hartley
act
gives
them
ample
ways
to
organize
subcontractors,
mechanical
contractors.
they
can
go
out
and
try
to
organize,
they
can
hold
an
election,
let
the
employees
decide.
but
as
this
type
of
activity
which
goes
right
to
the
source
of
the
work,
the
general
contractor,
and
says,
you
refused
to
do
business
with
anybody
who
doesn't
have
an
agreement
with
us
then
it
has
become
a
clear
cut
restrain
of
trade
beyond
any
--
no
way
i
think
we
could
find
any
legitimate
union
interest
in
it.
your
honors,
the
agreement
also
--
it's
not
limited
any
particular
project.
it's
limit
--
it
has
no
limitation
whatsoever.
it's
forever
future
on
any
construction
project
in
which
the
general
contractors
involved.
i
would
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
union's
sole
defense
to
this
case
and
that
is
section
8
(e)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
union
has
taken
the
position
that
section
8
(e)
which
was
enacted
in
1959
to
outlaw
hot
cargo
agreements,
protects
this
agreement.
your
honors
when
the
act
was
amended
in
1959,
it
came
about
because
really
of
two
reasons.
i
think
that
we
must
trace
very
quickly
the
history
and
what
brought
about
8
(e).
we
first
go
to
two
cases,
denver
building
trades,
this
court
decided
in
1954
which
clearly
distinguished
between
the
general
contractor
and
the
subcontractor
as
separate
employers
at
the
construction
project.
this
type
of
agreement
obliterates
that
decision.
if
the
union
can
radiate
these
disputes
from
with
a
particular
subcontractor
and
say,
no,
we
have
got
a
dispute
with
the
contractor,
we
have
got
a
primary
dispute;
all
it
takes
is
change
in
the
wording
on
their
picket
signs
and
denver
building
trades
is
gone,
that's
what
happened
in
this
case.
okay,
then
we
must
go
to
the
sand
door
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1958.
in
sand
door,
it
was
held
that
a
hot
cargo
clause
with
no
defense
to
a
secondary
boycott,
but
the
court
stated
that
if
an
employer
and
a
union
voluntarily
agreed
to
a
boycott,
that
is
not
a
violation
of
the
secondary
boycott
(inaudible)
if
it's
free
of
course,
if
it's
voluntary.
that
decision
is
what
led
to
the
enactment
of
8
(e)
to
the
taft-hartley
act.
congress
wanted
to
overrule
that
loophole,
which
they
considered
loophole
in
the
sand
door
decision
of
this
court.
now
when
the
amendments
went
in
1959,
it
was
hotly
contested.
some
congressmen
or
senators
wanted
to
outlaw
hot
cargo
agreements
in
all
industries
and
introduce
bills
to
that
effect.
on
the
other
hand,
a
group
wanted
to
overrule
denver
building
trades
and
they
wanted
to
wipe
out
all
probations
against
secondary
picketing
at
the
site
of
construction.
the
bills
that
were
designed
to
overrule
building
trades,
denver
building
trades
were
rejected
by
both
houses
of
congress.
the
bills
passed
by
the
senate
and
the
house
contained
no
special
rules
for
the
construction
industry.
the
bills
went
to
conference,
and
out
of
the
conference
report
we
find
that
a
proviso
was
added
for
the
construction
industry.
the
proviso
to
section
8
(e),
section
8
(e)
outlawed
in
all
hot
cargo
agreements
for
proviso
for
agreements
at
the
site
of
construction.
on
the
face
of
the
proviso
one
would
believe
that
it
could
cover
any
agreement
at
the
site
of
construction.
your
honors
when
you
read
that
legislative
history,
it's
set
forth
in
our
briefs
and
i
believe
i
read
every
page
of
it.
the
legislative
history
overwhelmingly
shows
that
congress
intended
several
things
about
the
proviso.
one,
that
it
only
applied
to
voluntary
agreements,
not
coercive
agreements.
when
senator
kennedy
reported
back
to
the
senate
from
the
conference
report,
he
said
that
the
proviso
to
8
(e)
is
not
intended
to
change
the
law
with
respect
to
picketing
at
an
construction
site,
that
denver
building
trades
is
still
good
law,
that
sand
door
is
good
law,
that
the
proviso
was
to
preserve
the
status
quo.
in
other
words,
what
was
legal
to
a
construction
industry
union
prior
to
1959
remained
legal.
they
came
out
with
nothing
more.
all
it
had
was
that
--
which
we
brought
out
in
sand
door
was
the
right
to
enter
into
a
voluntary
boycott
agreement.
congressman
barden
reported
back
to
the
house,
said
it
preserves
the
status
quo.
that
legislative
history
indicates
to
me,
and
i
believe
it
will
to
you
that
it
envisioned
an
employer-employee
relationship,
not
agreements
made
outside
of
the
employer-employee
relationship.
congress
never
in
their
wildest
dreams
would
have
figured
that
to
do
so
they
would
have
wiped
out
for
the
construction
industry
which
is
what
this
agreement
does.
all
of
the
secondary
boycott
bans,
all
of
the
employee
rights
under
section
7
runs
contrary
the
whole
act.
they
meant
an
employer-employee
relationship.
mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
that's
exactly
what
i
mean
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
exactly.
only
and
another
thing
too
is
the
when
we
go
back
and
really
look
at
the
anti-trust
implications,
8
(e)
grants
no
exemption
from
anti-trust.
the
proviso
simply
says
that,
it
shall
not
be
a
violation
of
this
clause
8
(e).
congress
and
let's
look
at
the
other
exemption,
just
for
comparison
with
the
garment
industry
exemption,
there
was
another
exemption
from
hot
cargo
clause
in
the
garment
industry,
the
second
proviso
8
(e).
in
that
when
they
say,
for
purpose
of
this
section
8
(e)
and
8
(b)
(4)
the
secondary
boycotts
bans,
the
garment
industry
so
forth
is
exempt.
the
construction
industry
was
not
exempted
from
the
secondary
boycott
bans.
your
honors,
there
is
no
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
there
is
not
much
majority
opinion
i
do
agree
with,
but
i
do
agree
with
this,
that
there
is
no
case
ever
been
decided
on
the
extent
of
8
(e)
the
proviso
outside
of
the
employer-employee
relationship.
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
admitted
footnote
10,
page
9
of
their
brief
in
this
case.
i
am
glad
they
filed
that
brief,
because
i
have
read
so
many
other
cases
looking
for
it
and
i
never
did
that
the
nlrb
has
never
decided
the
issue.
i
would
be
less
than
candid
with
this
court,
if
i
didn't
tell
you
and
i
am
sure
you
have
read
it
in
the
briefs
that
the
general
counsel
of
the
nlrb,
for
reasons
known
only
to
himself
refuses
to
issue
a
complaint.
i
don't
know
why
he
wouldn't.
the
fifth
circuit
pleaded
with
him.
it
is
for
the
board
to
decide
this
question,
the
labor
question.
i
think
that
you
must
decide
it
in
order
to
properly
decide
the
anti-trust
questions.
we
must
compare
the
agreement
with
national
labor
policy
and
when
it
is
compared
--
mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
he
said
--
he
has
given
his
reasons.
mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
correct
your
honor,
but
let
me
just
address
myself
to
that
quickly
what
the
general
counsel,
which
his
opinion
--
mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
didn't
mean
to
reply
that
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
he
has
explained
his
reasons,
but
i
am
glad
you
have
raised
it.
i'd
like
to
address
that.
his
reasons,
he
says
because
it
was
to
preserve
the
status
quo.
i
agree
with
that.
it
was
to
preserve
the
status
quo.
what
was
the
pattern
of
collective
bargaining
prior
to
1959
amendments?
i
have
found
three
cases
where
unions
tried
to
obtain
the
agreement
outside
of
the
employer-employee
relationship
prior
to
1959
and
only
three.
in
all
three
of
those
cases
held
it
was
illegal
and
they
are
cited
at
page
38
of
my
brief
on
the
merits,
your
honor,
the
blue
one.
that
was
texas
industries,
inc.,
bangor
building
trades
and
(inaudible).
now
the
fifth
circuit,
i
think
this
is
very
important,
they
saw
the
issue
too.
they
saw
that
whether
or
not
they
had
been
in
practice
prior
to
1959
would
help
guide
as
to
what
congress
was
doing
and
they
directed
all
parties,
including
the
union
the
afl-cio
building
trades
department,
all
amicus
to
file
supplemental
briefs
pointing
out
any
source
showing
the
collective
bargaining
pattern
in
the
construction
industry
prior
to
1959.
your
honors,
not
one
agreement,
not
one
type
was
shown
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
indeed
justice
clark
in
his
dissent
stated
that
they
were
even
not
able
to
show
one,
not
one
much
less
a
pattern.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
f.
canterbury,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
richard
is
suggesting
that
there
is
plenty
of
available
remedies
pursuant
to
the
national
labor
relation
act
is
like
giving
connell
snow
in
winter.
it's
well
known
that
the
general
counsel
will
not
issue
a
compliant
and
nlrb
couldn't
decide
it
if
they
wanted
to.
no
way
they
can
decide
the
question
because
the
general
counsel
would
not
let
them
so.
going
to
the
board
is
a
useless
act
and
as
i
said
in
my
brief,
i
might
as
well
file
in
a
waste
basket.
now
let's
look
what
is
this
agreement
addressed
to.
mr.
richard
says
the
agreement
is
addressed
to
benefit
union
members
directly.
the
affect
of
the
agreement
is
not
to
benefit
members,
union
members
direct,
if
it
was
look
and
take
actions
against
those
who
employ
their
members.
the
affect
of
the
agreement
is
to
drive
subcontractors,
our
manufactures
who
furnish
and
install
products
at
the
construction
site
out
of
the
market,
unless
they'll
come
into
local
100.
that
is
the
affect
of
the
agreement.
if
it
were
addressed
to
the
immediate
employer
employee
relationship
they
may
well
have
a
point,
but
it
is
not.
connell,
if
his
carpenters
should
entered
into
a
collective
bargain
agreement,
which
he
has
one
with
the
carpenters,
they
have
got
their
work
to
protect.
and
if
they
make
limitations
on
subbing
out
their
work
and
if
he
gives
it
up
and
collective
bargaining
for
whatever
scale
of
value
he
puts
on
it,
that
rises
out
of
collecting
bargaining
process.
there
is
something
to
trap
back
and
forth.
and
employer
employee
negotiations
which
the
whole
labor
act
is
designed
to
falls
to.
step
it
outside
of
the
employer
employee
relationship
with
the
50
cent
piece
of
cardboard
and
a
picket
sign
either
the
contractor
signs
up
and
agrees
to
assist
the
union
to
drive
all
other,
all
open
shop
mechanical
contractors
out
of
the
market
or
else
the
general
contractor
goes
broke,
of
course
he
cannot
resist
for
long.
so
your
honors
i
believe
it
when
we
really
look
at
effective
agreement
let
us
look
at
who
are
they
addressing
it
to.
they
are
not
addressing
to
those
who
employ
their
members.
they
are
going
without,
and
going
outside
of
that
source
to
lock
up
this
market.
no
i
do
not
care
whether
we
call
it
a
conspiracy,
i
do
not
believe
you
do
either.
there
is
still
lot
of
secrecy
in
the
term
conspiracy.
let
us
just
call
it
a
contract,
let
us
look
at
the
contract.
our
written
contract,
connell
will
not
do
business
with
anybody
that
do
not
have
agreement
with
us.
call
it
a
combination,
we
have
got
a
labor
party
and
non-labor
party
combining,
our
conspiracy.
i
do
not
believe
this
man
makes
this
much
difference.
i
think
we
have
a
clear
cut
contract
in
restrain
of
trade.
i
believe
there
is
no
immunity
when
you
take
and
compare
the
affects
of
the
agreement
with
national
labor
policy.
thank
you,
your
honors.
