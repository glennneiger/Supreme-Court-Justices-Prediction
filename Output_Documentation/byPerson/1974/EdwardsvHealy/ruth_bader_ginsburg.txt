justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
first
appellant's
mootness
suggestion.
in
a
judgment
entered
in
september
1973,
the
louisiana
constitution,
article
vii,
section
41
and
legislation
enacted
pursuant
to
it
where
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
sitting
as
a
three-judge
court.
article
vii,
section
41,
precludes
jury
service
by
women
who
do
not
file
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
a
written
declaration
of
their
desire
to
serve.
on
april
20,
1974
while
this
appeal
was
pending,
louisiana
adopted
a
new
constitution
to
become
affective
at
the
start
of
1975.
on
the
basis
of
that
development,
appellant
suggests
that
this
controversy,
although,
not
now
moot
will
become
moot
on
january
1,
1975.
the
new
constitution
as
appellate
has
pointed
out
provides
that
all
citizens
who
have
reached
the
age
of
majority
are
eligible
for
jury
service.
it
authorizes
the
legislature
to
provide
additional
qualifications.
the
legislature
has
not
yet
had
its
session
to
implement
the
constitutional
divisions
and
it
directs
the
louisiana
supreme
court
to
provide
by
rule
for
exemption.
the
draft
order
on
exemptions
under
the
new
constitution
and
next
to
appellant's
memorandum
suggesting
mootness
is
at
this
stage
merely
a
proposal.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
it
was
drafted
by
justice
tate,
who
has
been
a
consistent
dissenter
from
the
louisiana's
supreme
court
opinions
upholding
the
jury
service
exemption
for
women.
the
volunteer's
only
scheme
remains
fully
operative
until
that
system
is
discarded
and
replaced
by
a
system
that
renders
women
and
men
equally
amenable
to
jury
service.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
no
way
unknowing
that
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
unless
and
until
something
comes
from
the
supreme
court
or
from
the
legislature
there
is
nothing
on
which
to
base
a
change.
there's
just
a
constitutional
provision,
is
absence
of
a
constitutional
provision
where
there
was
one
before.
in
hoyt
v.
florida
there
was
no
constitutional
provision
involved,
there
was
just
a
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
will
say,
“simply,”
this
is
practically
verbatim
from
the
text,
“all
citizens
who
have
reached
the
age
of
majority
are
eligible
for
jury
service.”
the
women
are
not
eligible
for
jury
service
and
then
it
authorizes
the
legislature
to
provide
and
the
expression
is
additional
qualifications
and
it
directs
the
louisiana
supreme
court
to
provide
by
rule
for
exemption.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
likely
still
to
follow
the
statute
and
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure
402,
which
says
that
we
don't
put
women
on
the
list
unless
they
register,
the
statute
would
still
be
enforced
unless
the
legislature
acts
to
ignore
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
persons
are
eligible
for
jury
service
or
all
citizens
are
eligible
for
jury
service
in
louisiana.
now,
it
isn't
a
question
of
women's
ineligibility.
question
is
whether
they
are
to
be
accorded
an
exemption
under
which
they
are
not
put
on
the
list
unless
they
affirmatively
come
in
and
volunteer
for
service.
appellees
and
the
class
they
represent,
all
female
citizens
of
louisiana
engaged
in
state
court
litigation
in
which
trial
by
jury
is
sought.
they
maintain
that
the
louisiana
jury
selection
system
which
effectively
excludes
more
than
half
of
the
population
eligible
for
jury
service,
impacts
adversely
upon
the
state's
adjudicatory
system
and
denies
all
litigants
jury
trials
consistent
with
representative
government
and
a
democratic
society
composed
of
men
and
women.
more
particularly,
they
assert
that
the
louisiana
jury
selection
system
denies
them
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
due
process
of
law
because
the
system
precludes
any
possibility
that
their
cases
will
be
tried
by
a
jury
drawn
from
a
representative
cross-section
of
the
community.
rather
the
system
assures
that
their
peers,
members
of
their
sex,
53
%
of
the
population
of
persons
eligible
for
service
are
almost
totally
absent
from
the
jury
pool.
appellees
standing
to
challenge
the
absence
of
members
of
their
class
is
evident.
women
are
surely
a
cognizable
group
within
the
community.
they
are
a
readily
identifiable
class
similarly
constant
in
membership.
as
litigants,
women
are
no
less
entitled
to
maintain
a
challenge
of
this
kind
than
on
members
of
a
racial,
national
origin
or
religious
group
as
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
three
classes
in
the
action
as
instituted
in
a
district
court.
judge
rubin
left
open
the
question
of
a
standing
of
two
of
those
classes.
he
declared
that
the
class
of
women
litigants
had
standing
and
therefore,
it
was
unnecessary
to
decide
whether
the
class
of
woman
as
potential
jurors
or
of
men
as
potential
jurors
had
standing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
yes
they
were.
in
fact
judge
rubin
point
specifically
to
jenny
lee
smith
baggett,
one
of
he
named
representatives
of
the
cause
of
litigants.
she
had
filed
a
civil
damage
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
presented
a
certain
problem.
the
difficulty
of
joining
women
who
are
enmeshed
in
the
criminal
process,
in
a
civil
litigation
report
of
three-judge
court,
so
our
named
representatives
are
all
civil
litigants,
not
criminal
litigants.
however,
they
assert
the
interest
of
women
litigants
generally
in
both
proceedings.
this
court
noted
in
ballard
against
united
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
two
claims.
one,
that
they
are
denied
equal
protection
as
any
other
well
defined
group
would
be
by
the
total
absence
of
their
peers
from
the
jury.
and
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
am
not
aware
of
that
new
theory.
i
subscribe
and
i
think
most
people
do
to
a
theory
announced
by
one
of
the
justices
some
years
ago
in
ballard
against
the
unites
states,
that
the
two
sexes
are
not
fungible,
that
the
absence
of
either
may
make
the
jury
even
less
representative
of
the
community
than
it
would
be
if
an
economic
or
a
racial
group
were
excluded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
other
is
denial
of
due
process.
the
right
of
every
litigant
who
is
subject
to
jury
trial
to
a
jury
that
is
drawn
from
a
representative
cross-section
of
the
community
and
that
is
the
right
of
all
litigants
male
or
female
to
that
jury
composed
of
a
representative
cross-section.
the
difficulty
for
the
three-judge
court
was
this
court's
1961
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
source
of
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
due
process,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
court
has
expressed
in,
for
example,
appeal
against
southern
pacific
company
328
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
proposition
expressed
that
went
beyond
supervision
of
the
federal
judicial
system.
the
court
said
that
the
american
tradition
of
trial
by
jury
in
criminal
or
civil
cases
necessarily
contemplates
an
impartial
jury
drawn
from
a
cross-section
of
the
community.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes
the
--
well,
at
least
i
should
put
it
even
if
there
is
no
seventh
amendment
right
to
jury
trial
in
a
state
court,
once
the
state
does
provide
a
jury
trial
justice
white,
the
state
does
provide
a
grand
jury
though
it's
not
required,
then
its
selection
and
procedures
become
subject
to
equal
protection
and
due
process
scrutiny
as
does
any
other
state
action.
on
the
merits,
hoyt
against
florida
upheld
the
statute
virtually
identical
to
the
scheme
at
issue
here
and
indeed
this
court
has
not
yet
explicitly
reconsidered
its
1880
dictum
in
strauder
against
west
virginia,
100
u.s.
at
310,
that
a
state
may
constitutionally
confine
jury
duty
to
males
after
strauder,
but
before
hoyt
in
1947
and
fay
v.
new
york,
332
u.s.
the
“blue
ribbon”
jury
was
contested
but
also
in
new
york's
automatic
exemption
of
women,
the
court
upheld
that
women
don't
need
exemption
and
in
the
process
indicated
that
women
might
be
beyond
the
pale
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
majority
opinion
in
fay
assert
that
though,
there
maybe
no
logical
reasoning
for
differential
treatment
of
men
and
women
for
jury
service
purposes,
the
states
are
constitutionally
compelled
to
acknowledge
only
one
aspect
of
women's
full
membership
in
the
political
community,
her
nineteenth
amendment
right
to
vote.
the
fay
court
was
relying
exclusively
on
the
fact
that
well
into
the
20th
century,
it
was
the
virtually
universal
practice
in
the
united
states
to
allow
only
men
to
sit
on
juries.
appellants
had
asserted
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
and
appellees
agree,
that
this
case
presents
an
appropriate
occasion
for
the
court
to
articulate
guidelines
and
standards
with
respect
to
the
equal
amenability
of
women
and
men
to
jury
service.
because
this
court's
own
past
pronouncements
have
operated
not
merely
to
sanction
women
only
jury
service
exemptions,
devious
from
the
start,
but
to
impede
change
long
over
due
though
a
majority
of
states
now
treat
jury
service
as
a
basic
civil
right
as
well
as
a
fundamental
civic
responsibility.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
registration
system.
there
are
six
other
states
that
have
one
slight
variant
on
that.
women
are
placed
in
the
jury
pool
but
they
are
exempt
simply
because
they
are
women
and
then
there
are
several
other
states
that
have
a
range
of
women
only
exemptions
and
these
exemptions
persist
well
into
the
1970's
and
challenges
to
them
are
rejected
summarily
by
both
federal
and
state
courts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
hoyt
is
precedent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
proposed
amendment
has
been
ratified
by
33
states.
the
period
in
which
ratification
is
open
runs
until
1979.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
38.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
33.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
no,
it
adds
a
question
not
appropriate
to
go
into
at
this
point,
but
two
have
purported
to
withdraw
their
ratification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
know
i'm
not.
it
would
be
31
if
those
withdrawals
were
effective.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
am
including
them,
yes
correct,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
least
five
and
if
you
accept
the
argument
that
withdrawal
is
effective
than
seven.
the
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
know
what
the
counties
on
that.
a
number
of
states
have
rejected
it
but
that
doesn't
--
that's
not
binding.
if
a
state
that
once
rejects,
i
think
that's
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes
and
of
course,
that
as
would
be
expected,
the
states
that
have
already
ratified
with
states
in
which
the
ratification
campaigns
were
easier
than
the
remaining
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
yes.
the
progress
has
been
slow
since
the
frontiero
opinion
on
ratification.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it
unrelated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
unrelated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
--
i
might
have
say
with
it
--
that
with
respect
to
this
strauder
dictum
and
without
regard
to
any
bold
dynamic
development
of
that
dictum
is
totally
understandable
in
it's
historic
context.
the
common
more
jury
was
composed
of
three
unlawful
men
not
women
and
blackstone
had
explained
in
the
third
volume
of
his
commentary
that,
though
the
latin
word
“homo”
are
referred
to
members
of
both
sexes,
the
female
was,
of
course,
excluded
from
jury
service
because
of
the
defects
of
her
sex
and
that
pattern
was
accepted
in
19th
century
even
early
20th
century
united
states.
why
should
the
women
serve
on
juries
when
they
couldn't
vote
or
hold
office,
when
many
of
them,
a
married
woman,
were
subject
to
a
range
of
legal
disabilities
that
drastically
curtailed
their
scope
of
activity.
hoyt
decided
just
13
years
ago
is
not
susceptible
to
the
same
kind
of
historical
interpretation,
but
it
maybe
explained
on
the
basis
of
an
assumption
apparently
indulged
by
the
court,
that
the
volunteers'
only
system
might
yet
yield
substantial
female
participation.
the
system
had
been
in
effect
in
florida
only
some
10
years
at
the
time
hoyt
was
tried.
until
1949,
florida
(inaudible)
jury
said,
“this
is
exclusively
to
men.”
the
three
concurring
justices
were
unable
to
say
based
on
the
hoyt
record
that
florida
failed
to
make
an
effort
to
have
women
perform
jury
duty
and
the
majority
opinion
suggests
that
appellant
hoyt
had
not
ruled
out
other
circumstances
for
chance
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
porosity
of
women
jurors.
but
in
the
instant
case,
it
is
not
disputed
that
the
louisiana
selection
system
and
only
that
system
not
other
circumstances
and
not
chance,
produces
jury
list
that
rarely
include
any
woman's
name.
based
on
the
stipulated
facts,
the
court
below
found
that
louisiana's
benign
dispensation,
not
chance
yields
jury
panels
that
never
include
more
than
5%
women
and
frequently
less.
significantly
mr.
justice
douglas,
who
concurred
in
hoyt
later
acknowledged
that
inevitably,
a
volunteer's
only
system
results
in
almost
as
total
an
exclusion
as
would
obtain
in
women
were
not
permitted
to
serve
at
all
for
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
had
not
made
a
survey
but
i
think
that
the
stipulation
was
generous
that
not
more
than
10%
are
i
think,
i
suppose
less.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
within
in
the
state,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
by
the
time
this
case
is
decided?
in
other
words,
if
an
exemption
similar
to
the
one
attached
to
the
memorandum
is
adopted
and
if
the
legislator
doesn't
put
on
additional
qualifications
and
if
the
list,
that's
an
important
thing
the
implementation
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
then,
there
is
a
difficulty
in
my
case
that
is
not
present
in
taylor
that
is
in
showing
injury.
if
you're
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
are
not
claiming
the
damages
for
the
past.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
that
happens
well,
we
don't
--
its
mere
speculation
whether
it
will
happen
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
it
would
be
certainly
difficult
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
should
be
accomplished
before
the
first
of
january
because
that's
one
that
when
the
new
constitution
goes
into
an
effect
whether
it
will
be
i
don't
know.
i
was
told
at
the
court
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
i
think
that
is
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
there
is
--
that
is
a
draft
rule
drafted
by
justice
tate
that
is
now
circulating.
what
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
rule,
i
might
say
is
a
model
with
jury
exemptions.
it
makes
no
distinction
whatever
between
men
and
women.
it
permits
for
excuses
based
on
individualized
circumstances
and
so
that,
in
fact,
is
the
rule
of
that
appellees
wished
louisiana
had.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
no,
not
at
this
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
can't
ask
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
since
the
standing
of
the
other
groups
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
decision
below
was
to
recognize
clearly
the
standing
of
one
group.
the
standing
of
another
group,
i
think,
women
as
potential
jurors
is
also
clear
in
judge
rubin's
opinion
at
page
1114.
he
does
find
unequivocally
that
women
as
jurors
are
denied
equal
protection.
since
the
system
conspicuously
fails
to
meet
the
equal
protection
requirements
for
women
as
potential
jurors
because
he
made
that
finding
on
the
merits,
it's
difficult
to
understand
why
he
left
over
is
the
standing
question
and
indeed
appellees
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
not
his
position
and
i
suppose
it
wasn't
because
that's
--
we
could
make
an
analogy
to
voting.
suppose
there
was
a
requirement
that
all
women
were
eligible
to
vote
but
they
must
come
in
and
register,
while
the
men
automatically
added
to
the
list
when
they
reached
the
age
of
18.
i
suppose
that
would
also
be
saying
that
women
could
do
if
they
wanted
to
do
but
that
additional
burden
i
think
would
be
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
basis
of
the
size
of
the
class.
not
on
the
basis
that
they
could
register
to
service.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
of
course,
i'd
be
delighted.
finally,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
purported
justifications
for
hoyt
that
i
heard
in
the
louisiana
and
in
federal
state
courts,
passing
on
similar
to
those
likely
less
extreme
exceptions.
two
points
are
made.
one,
it's
administratively
convenient
to
exclude
the
women
as
a
class,
and
the
other
is
we
must
be
concerned
with
family
stability.
as
far
as
the
administrative
convenience
of
a
lump
exemption
of
an
individual
project
excuse
is
concerned,
this
court's
decisions
in
reed
v.
reed
404
u.s.
and
frontiero
v.
richardson
411
u.s.,
should
be
dispositive
administrative
ease
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
legislative
resort
to
a
gender
criteria.
with
respect
to
ensuring
the
care
of
dependence,
particularly
small
children,
the
women
only
exemption
is
a
appallingly
overbroad,
and
stereotypically
underinclusive.
overboard
because
it
includes
the
childless
woman,
the
woman
whose
children
are
grown,
the
woman
who
can
provide
without
hardship
or
care
consistent
with
her
family's
needs
while
she's
away
from
home
and
underinclusive
because
it
does
not
encompass
men
among
them
without
fathers
husbands
with
incapacitated
wives
whose
presence
at
home
maybe
essential
to
the
family's
well-being,
but
the
total
rationality
of
the
louisiana
classification
is
demonstrated
by
census
data
and
labor
market
statistics.
focusing
on
the
statistics
for
louisiana
set
out
at
pages
18
and
19
of
our
brief,
in
1970,
59%
of
louisiana's
total
adult
female
population
had
no
children
under
18
and
of
the
41%
with
children
under
18,
37%
were
in
the
labor
force.
thus,
for
nearly
three
quarters
of
the
population
covered
by
this
benign
dispensation,
child
care
is
not
a
factor
determining
involvement
in
civic
responsibility
or
in
employment
outside
of
home.
national
statistics
are
similar.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
think
they
were
two
reasons
i
did
not
tend
to
be
cavalier.
there
was
the
point
that
--
no,
two
points.
one,
there
was
no
assurance
at
that
time
that
this
system
would
in
fact
produced
no
women.
the
three
concurring
justices
indicated
that,
that
maybe
if
florida
makes
it
a
good
faith
effort
to
try
and
get
women,
women
will
serve.
later,
i
think
it's
been
acknowledged
that
as
a
practical
matter
a
volunteer's
only
system
whether
it's
offered
to
men
or
women
will
lead
to
virtual
absence
of
that
group
from
the
jury
people
simply
do
not,
most
people,
do
not
volunteer
for
what
they
might
regard
as
a
burdensome
civic
responsibility.
that
was
one
aspect
of
it.
the
other
aspect
of
it
was
that
the
statistics
in
hoyt
not
the
same
as
those
presented
here
in
addition
to
the
tremendous
increase
even
initial
period
of
time,
women's
participation
in
the
labor
force.
hoyt
court,
never
adverted
to
all
the
unemployed
women,
who
do
not
have
childcare
responsibilities,
that
was
another
factor
and
the
third
factor
was
the
concentration
in
hoyt
on
the
woman
as
potential
juror.
this
was
a
benign
dispensation
of
favor
to
her,
she
could
serve
if
she
wanted
to,
but
she
had
no
responsibility
to
serve.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
i
may
take
a
cue
from
mr.
justice
brennan
on
that
on
his
remark
yesterday,
kahn
against
shevin
was
a
tax
case
and
the
dominant
theme
of
that
opinion
is
the
large
leeway,
the
line
drawing
permitted
to
the
states
in
making
tax
classifications.
but
what
the
focus
on
women
jurors
caused
the
court
to
lose
sight
of
what
should
have
been
the
principle
focus.
now
that
action
--
in
that
action,
the
defendant's
crime
was
committed
after
an
altercation
in
which
she
claimed
her
husband
had
insulted
and
humiliated
her
to
the
breaking
point,
convicted
of
second
degree
murder
by
an
all-male
jury.
she
believed
that
women
jurors
might
better
understand
her
state
of
mind
when
she
picked
up
a
baseball
bat
and
administered
the
blow
that
led
to
the
litigation.
the
court
did
not
focus
on
the
denials
of
equal
protection
due
process
to
mrs.
hoyt.
the
focus
was
on
the
benign
nature
of
a
classification
to
women
as
jurors
rather
than
the
unfairness
to
the
litigant.
and
that
viewed
in
that
light,
the
overriding
consideration
really
should
not
be
the
burden
or
the
benefit
of
jury
service
to
perspective
jurors,
but
the
fairness
of
the
system
to
litigants.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
it
provides
an
--
i
think
it
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh!
oh
i'm
sorry.
i
though
you
meant
upper
age
limits.
yes,
certainly
than
18
is
the
age
limit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
70
would
be
the
basis
for
an
exemption,
i
think.
i
don't
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
people
are
off
the
list.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
75
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
course,
there
is
a
tremendous
difference
between
age,
which
is
something
that
happens
to
all
of
us
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--
and
sex
which
is
immutable
and
doesn't
change.
and
that's
why
age
classifications
should
not
properly
be
considered
in
the
same
light
as
classification
based
on
a
factor
like
race
or
sex
or
national
origin
something
that
is
not
going
to
happen
to
everybody.
you
put
in
that
status
at
birth
and
you
can't
get
out
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
from
(inaudible)
–
[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
well,
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think
that
it
put
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
hoyt
cannot
be
squared
with
these
three
judge
court
decision.
this
three
judge
court
said
in
hoyt
was
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
sterile
precedent
and
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
and
i
think
that
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
after
all
women
are
like
men
so
they
represented
a
cross
section
so
it
can
be
achieved
by
having
men
represent
women.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
this,
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
point
has
acknowledged
that
this
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
it
were
necessary
to
prove
the
unfairness
in
any
particular
case
that
would
be
virtually
impossible
standard
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
is
a
general
rule
i
believe,
i
mean
not
only
from
(inaudible)
but
from
williams
case
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
it
certainly
wasn't
in
hoyt,
but
there
been
a
lot
of
jury
cases
in
this
court,
carter
against
jury
commission,
williams
against
florida,
talking
about
the
essential
attributes
of
a
jury
trial
and
one
of
the
critical
attributes
is
that
it
would
be
drawn
from
a
representative
cross
section
of
the
community,
something
that
cannot
be
achieved
if
women
are
absent
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
think
that
it
has
come
up
in
at
least
three
context
equal
protection,
due
process,
and
then
specifically,
in
the
context
of
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
case
in
this
court?
there
are
several
district
court
decisions.
all
men
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
--
i
think
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
court
--
i
think
said
that
in
due
process
discussion
in
the
context
of
the
cross
section
requirement.
what
it
did
say
was
that,
the
absence
of
women
makes
impossible
this
cross
section.
the
cross
section
is
essential
to
the
integrity
of
the
jury
system,
is
inherent
in
due
process
of
law
and
therefore
as
a
safeguard
for
all
litigants.
that
was
the
determination
of
the
court
below
similar
to
the
position
taken
by
justice
marshal
in
peters
v.
kiff.
i
think,
i've
got
no
time
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
first
appellant's
mootness
suggestion.
in
a
judgment
entered
in
september
1973,
the
louisiana
constitution,
article
vii,
section
41
and
legislation
enacted
pursuant
to
it
where
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
sitting
as
a
three-judge
court.
article
vii,
section
41,
precludes
jury
service
by
women
who
do
not
file
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
a
written
declaration
of
their
desire
to
serve.
on
april
20,
1974
while
this
appeal
was
pending,
louisiana
adopted
a
new
constitution
to
become
affective
at
the
start
of
1975.
on
the
basis
of
that
development,
appellant
suggests
that
this
controversy,
although,
not
now
moot
will
become
moot
on
january
1,
1975.
the
new
constitution
as
appellate
has
pointed
out
provides
that
all
citizens
who
have
reached
the
age
of
majority
are
eligible
for
jury
service.
it
authorizes
the
legislature
to
provide
additional
qualifications.
the
legislature
has
not
yet
had
its
session
to
implement
the
constitutional
divisions
and
it
directs
the
louisiana
supreme
court
to
provide
by
rule
for
exemption.
the
draft
order
on
exemptions
under
the
new
constitution
and
next
to
appellant's
memorandum
suggesting
mootness
is
at
this
stage
merely
a
proposal.
it's
interesting
to
note
that
it
was
drafted
by
justice
tate,
who
has
been
a
consistent
dissenter
from
the
louisiana's
supreme
court
opinions
upholding
the
jury
service
exemption
for
women.
the
volunteer's
only
scheme
remains
fully
operative
until
that
system
is
discarded
and
replaced
by
a
system
that
renders
women
and
men
equally
amenable
to
jury
service.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
is
no
way
unknowing
that
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
unless
and
until
something
comes
from
the
supreme
court
or
from
the
legislature
there
is
nothing
on
which
to
base
a
change.
there's
just
a
constitutional
provision,
is
absence
of
a
constitutional
provision
where
there
was
one
before.
in
hoyt
v.
florida
there
was
no
constitutional
provision
involved,
there
was
just
a
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
will
say,
“simply,”
this
is
practically
verbatim
from
the
text,
“all
citizens
who
have
reached
the
age
of
majority
are
eligible
for
jury
service.”
the
women
are
not
eligible
for
jury
service
and
then
it
authorizes
the
legislature
to
provide
and
the
expression
is
additional
qualifications
and
it
directs
the
louisiana
supreme
court
to
provide
by
rule
for
exemption.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
likely
still
to
follow
the
statute
and
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure
402,
which
says
that
we
don't
put
women
on
the
list
unless
they
register,
the
statute
would
still
be
enforced
unless
the
legislature
acts
to
ignore
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
persons
are
eligible
for
jury
service
or
all
citizens
are
eligible
for
jury
service
in
louisiana.
now,
it
isn't
a
question
of
women's
ineligibility.
question
is
whether
they
are
to
be
accorded
an
exemption
under
which
they
are
not
put
on
the
list
unless
they
affirmatively
come
in
and
volunteer
for
service.
appellees
and
the
class
they
represent,
all
female
citizens
of
louisiana
engaged
in
state
court
litigation
in
which
trial
by
jury
is
sought.
they
maintain
that
the
louisiana
jury
selection
system
which
effectively
excludes
more
than
half
of
the
population
eligible
for
jury
service,
impacts
adversely
upon
the
state's
adjudicatory
system
and
denies
all
litigants
jury
trials
consistent
with
representative
government
and
a
democratic
society
composed
of
men
and
women.
more
particularly,
they
assert
that
the
louisiana
jury
selection
system
denies
them
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
due
process
of
law
because
the
system
precludes
any
possibility
that
their
cases
will
be
tried
by
a
jury
drawn
from
a
representative
cross-section
of
the
community.
rather
the
system
assures
that
their
peers,
members
of
their
sex,
53
%
of
the
population
of
persons
eligible
for
service
are
almost
totally
absent
from
the
jury
pool.
appellees
standing
to
challenge
the
absence
of
members
of
their
class
is
evident.
women
are
surely
a
cognizable
group
within
the
community.
they
are
a
readily
identifiable
class
similarly
constant
in
membership.
as
litigants,
women
are
no
less
entitled
to
maintain
a
challenge
of
this
kind
than
on
members
of
a
racial,
national
origin
or
religious
group
as
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
three
classes
in
the
action
as
instituted
in
a
district
court.
judge
rubin
left
open
the
question
of
a
standing
of
two
of
those
classes.
he
declared
that
the
class
of
women
litigants
had
standing
and
therefore,
it
was
unnecessary
to
decide
whether
the
class
of
woman
as
potential
jurors
or
of
men
as
potential
jurors
had
standing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
yes
they
were.
in
fact
judge
rubin
point
specifically
to
jenny
lee
smith
baggett,
one
of
he
named
representatives
of
the
cause
of
litigants.
she
had
filed
a
civil
damage
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
presented
a
certain
problem.
the
difficulty
of
joining
women
who
are
enmeshed
in
the
criminal
process,
in
a
civil
litigation
report
of
three-judge
court,
so
our
named
representatives
are
all
civil
litigants,
not
criminal
litigants.
however,
they
assert
the
interest
of
women
litigants
generally
in
both
proceedings.
this
court
noted
in
ballard
against
united
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
two
claims.
one,
that
they
are
denied
equal
protection
as
any
other
well
defined
group
would
be
by
the
total
absence
of
their
peers
from
the
jury.
and
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
am
not
aware
of
that
new
theory.
i
subscribe
and
i
think
most
people
do
to
a
theory
announced
by
one
of
the
justices
some
years
ago
in
ballard
against
the
unites
states,
that
the
two
sexes
are
not
fungible,
that
the
absence
of
either
may
make
the
jury
even
less
representative
of
the
community
than
it
would
be
if
an
economic
or
a
racial
group
were
excluded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
other
is
denial
of
due
process.
the
right
of
every
litigant
who
is
subject
to
jury
trial
to
a
jury
that
is
drawn
from
a
representative
cross-section
of
the
community
and
that
is
the
right
of
all
litigants
male
or
female
to
that
jury
composed
of
a
representative
cross-section.
the
difficulty
for
the
three-judge
court
was
this
court's
1961
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
source
of
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
due
process,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
court
has
expressed
in,
for
example,
appeal
against
southern
pacific
company
328
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
the
proposition
expressed
that
went
beyond
supervision
of
the
federal
judicial
system.
the
court
said
that
the
american
tradition
of
trial
by
jury
in
criminal
or
civil
cases
necessarily
contemplates
an
impartial
jury
drawn
from
a
cross-section
of
the
community.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes
the
--
well,
at
least
i

if
there
is
no

the

on
the
merits,
hoyt
against
florida
upheld
the
statute
virtually
identical
to
the
scheme
at
issue
here
and
indeed
this
court
has
not
yet
explicitly
reconsidered
its
1880
dictum
in
strauder
against
west
virginia,
100
u.s.
at
310,
that
a
state
may
constitutionally
confine
jury
duty
to
males
after
strauder,
but
before
hoyt
in
1947
and
fay
v.
new
york,
332
u.s.
the
“blue
ribbon”
jury
was
contested
but
also
in
new
york's
automatic
exemption
of
women,
the
court
upheld
that
women
don't
need
exemption
and
in
the
process
indicated
that
women
might
be
beyond
the
pale
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
majority
opinion
in
fay
assert
that
though,
there
maybe
no
logical
reasoning
for
differential
treatment
of
men
and
women
for
jury
service
purposes,
the
states
are
constitutionally
compelled
to
acknowledge
only
one
aspect
of
women's
full
membership
in
the
political
community,
her
nineteenth
amendment
right
to
vote.
the
fay
court
was
relying
exclusively
on
the
fact
that
well
into
the
20th
century,
it
was
the
virtually
universal
practice
in
the
united
states
to
allow
only
men
to
sit
on
juries.
appellants
had
asserted
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
and
appellees
agree,
that
this
case
presents
an
appropriate
occasion
for
the
court
to
articulate
guidelines
and
standards
with
respect
to
the
equal
amenability
of
women
and
men
to
jury
service.
because
this
court's
own
past
pronouncements
have
operated
not
merely
to
sanction
women
only
jury
service
exemptions,
devious
from
the
start,
but
to
impede
change
long
over
due
though
a
majority
of
states
now
treat
jury
service
as
a
basic
civil
right
as
well
as
a
fundamental
civic
responsibility.

in
the
registration
system.
there
are
six
other
states
that
have
one
slight
variant
on
that.
women
are
placed
in
the
jury
pool
but
they
are
exempt
simply
because
they
are
women
and
then
there
are
several
other
states
that
have
a
range
of
women
only
exemptions
and
these
exemptions
persist
well
into
the
1970's

justice

no.
no,
it
adds
a
question
not
appropriate
to
go
into
at
this
point,
but
two
have
purported
to
withdraw
their
ratification.
justice

it
would
be

justice

i
am
including

yes.
justice

at

five
and
if
you
accept
the

that

i
don't
know
what
the

on

a
number
of
states
have
rejected

but
that
doesn't
--
that's
not
binding.
if
a

that

rejects,
i
think
that's
--
justice
ruth
bader

yes.
justice
ruth
bader

yes.
justice
ruth
bader

yes
and
of
course,

as
would
be
expected,
the
states
that

already
ratified
with
states
in
which
the
ratification
campaigns
were
easier
than
the
remaining

justice

yes.
the
progress
has
been
slow
since
the
frontiero
opinion
on

justice

bader

i
think
it
unrelated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
unrelated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm
--
i
might
have
say
with
it
--
that
with
respect
to
this
strauder
dictum
and
without
regard
to
any
bold
dynamic
development
of
that
dictum
is
totally
understandable
in
it's
historic
context.
the
common
more
jury
was
composed
of
three
unlawful
men
not
women
and
blackstone
had
explained
in
the
third
volume
of
his
commentary
that,
though
the
latin
word
“homo”
are
referred
to
members
of
both
sexes,
the
female
was,
of
course,
excluded
from
jury
service
because
of
the
defects
of
her
sex
and
that
pattern
was
accepted
in
19th
century
even
early
20th
century
united
states.
why
should
the
women
serve
on
juries
when
they
couldn't
vote
or
hold
office,
when
many
of
them,
a
married
woman,
were
subject
to
a
range
of
legal
disabilities
that
drastically
curtailed
their
scope
of
activity.
hoyt
decided
just
13
years
ago
is
not
susceptible
to
the
same
kind
of
historical
interpretation,
but
it
maybe
explained
on
the
basis
of
an
assumption
apparently
indulged
by
the
court,
that
the
volunteers'
only
system
might
yet
yield
substantial
female
participation.
the
system
had
been
in
effect
in
florida
only
some
10
years
at
the
time
hoyt
was
tried.
until
1949,
florida
(inaudible)
jury
said,
“this
is
exclusively
to
men.”
the
three
concurring
justices
were
unable
to
say
based
on
the
hoyt
record
that
florida
failed
to
make
an
effort
to
have
women
perform
jury
duty
and
the
majority
opinion
suggests
that
appellant
hoyt
had
not
ruled
out
other
circumstances
for
chance
as
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
porosity
of
women
jurors.
but
in
the
instant
case,
it
is
not
disputed
that
the
louisiana
selection
system
and
only
that
system
not
other
circumstances
and
not
chance,
produces
jury
list
that
rarely
include
any
woman's
name.
based
on
the
stipulated
facts,
the
court
below
found
that
louisiana's
benign
dispensation,
not
chance
yields
jury
panels
that
never
include
more
than
5%
women
and
frequently
less.
significantly
mr.
justice
douglas,
who
concurred
in
hoyt
later
acknowledged
that
inevitably,
a
volunteer's
only
system
results
in
almost
as
total
an
exclusion
as
would
obtain
in
women
were
not
permitted
to
serve
at
all
for
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
had
not
made
a
survey
but
i
think
that
the
stipulation
was
generous
that
not
more
than
10%
are
i
think,
i
suppose
less.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
within
in
the
state,
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
by
the
time
this
case
is
decided?
in
other
words,
if
an
exemption
similar
to
the
one
attached
to
the
memorandum
is
adopted
and
if
the
legislator
doesn't
put
on
additional
qualifications
and
if
the
list,
that's
an
important
thing
the
implementation
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
then,
there
is
a
difficulty
in
my
case
that
is
not
present
in
taylor
that
is
in
showing
injury.
if
you're
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
are
not
claiming
the
damages
for
the
past.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
that
happens
well,
we
don't
--
its
mere
speculation
whether
it
will
happen
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
it
would
be
certainly
difficult
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
should
be
accomplished
before
the
first
of
january
because
that's
one
that
when
the
new
constitution
goes
into
an
effect
whether
it
will
be
i
don't
know.
i
was
told
at
the
court
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
i
think
that
is
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
there
is
--
that
is
a
draft
rule
drafted
by
justice
tate
that
is
now
circulating.
what
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
rule,
i
might
say
is
a
model
with
jury
exemptions.
it
makes
no
distinction
whatever
between
men
and
women.
it
permits
for
excuses
based
on
individualized
circumstances
and
so
that,
in
fact,
is
the
rule
of
that
appellees
wished
louisiana
had.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
no,
not
at
this
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
can't
ask
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
since
the
standing
of
the
other
groups
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
decision
below
was
to
recognize
clearly
the
standing
of
one
group.
the
standing
of
another
group,
i
think,
women
as
potential
jurors
is
also
clear
in
judge
rubin's
opinion
at
page
1114.
he
does
find
unequivocally
that
women
as
jurors
are
denied
equal
protection.
since
the
system
conspicuously
fails
to
meet
the
equal
protection
requirements
for
women
as
potential
jurors
because
he
made
that
finding
on
the
merits,
it's
difficult
to
understand
why
he
left
over
is
the
standing
question
and
indeed
appellees
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
not
his
position
and
i
suppose
it
wasn't
because
that's
--
we
could
make
an
analogy
to
voting.
suppose
there
was
a
requirement
that
all
women
were
eligible
to
vote
but
they
must
come
in
and
register,
while
the
men
automatically
added
to
the
list
when
they
reached
the
age
of
18.
i
suppose
that
would
also
be
saying
that
women
could
do
if
they
wanted
to
do
but
that
additional
burden
i
think
would
be
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
basis
of
the
size
of
the
class.
not
on
the
basis
that
they
could
register
to
service.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
of
course,
i'd
be
delighted.
finally,
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
purported
justifications
for
hoyt
that
i
heard
in
the
louisiana
and
in
federal
state
courts,
passing
on
similar
to
those
likely
less
extreme
exceptions.
two
points
are
made.
one,
it's
administratively
convenient
to
exclude
the
women
as
a
class,
and
the
other
is
we
must
be
concerned
with
family
stability.
as
far
as
the
administrative
convenience
of
a
lump
exemption
of
an
individual
project
excuse
is
concerned,
this
court's
decisions
in
reed
v.
reed
404
u.s.
and
frontiero
v.
richardson
411
u.s.,
should
be
dispositive
administrative
ease
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
legislative
resort
to
a
gender
criteria.
with
respect
to
ensuring
the
care
of
dependence,
particularly
small
children,
the
women
only
exemption
is
a
appallingly
overbroad,
and
stereotypically
underinclusive.
overboard
because
it
includes
the
childless
woman,
the
woman
whose
children
are
grown,
the
woman
who
can
provide
without
hardship
or
care
consistent
with
her
family's
needs
while
she's
away
from
home
and
underinclusive
because
it
does
not
encompass
men
among
them
without
fathers
husbands
with
incapacitated
wives
whose
presence
at
home
maybe
essential
to
the
family's
well-being,
but
the
total
rationality
of
the
louisiana
classification
is
demonstrated
by
census
data
and
labor
market
statistics.
focusing
on
the
statistics
for
louisiana
set
out
at
pages
18
and
19
of
our
brief,
in
1970,
59%
of
louisiana's
total
adult
female
population
had
no
children
under
18
and
of
the
41%
with
children
under
18,
37%
were
in
the
labor
force.
thus,
for
nearly
three
quarters
of
the
population
covered
by
this
benign
dispensation,
child
care
is
not
a
factor
determining
involvement
in
civic
responsibility
or
in
employment
outside
of
home.
national
statistics
are
similar.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
think
they
were
two
reasons
i
did
not
tend
to
be
cavalier.
there
was
the
point
that
--
no,
two
points.
one,
there
was
no
assurance
at
that
time
that
this
system
would
in
fact
produced
no
women.
the
three
concurring
justices
indicated
that,
that
maybe
if
florida
makes
it
a
good
faith
effort
to
try
and
get
women,
women
will
serve.
later,
i
think
it's
been
acknowledged
that
as
a
practical
matter
a
volunteer's
only
system
whether
it's
offered
to
men
or
women
will
lead
to
virtual
absence
of
that
group
from
the
jury
people
simply
do
not,
most
people,
do
not
volunteer
for
what
they
might
regard
as
a
burdensome
civic
responsibility.
that
was
one
aspect
of
it.
the
other
aspect
of
it
was
that
the
statistics
in
hoyt
not
the
same
as
those
presented
here
in
addition
to
the
tremendous
increase
even
initial
period
of
time,
women's
participation
in
the
labor
force.
hoyt
court,
never
adverted
to
all
the
unemployed
women,
who
do
not
have
childcare
responsibilities,
that
was
another
factor
and
the
third
factor
was
the
concentration
in
hoyt
on
the
woman
as
potential
juror.
this
was
a
benign
dispensation
of
favor
to
her,
she
could
serve
if
she
wanted
to,
but
she
had
no
responsibility
to
serve.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
i
may
take
a
cue
from
mr.
justice
brennan
on
that
on
his
remark
yesterday,
kahn
against
shevin
was
a
tax
case
and
the
dominant
theme
of
that
opinion
is
the
large
leeway,
the
line
drawing
permitted
to
the
states
in
making
tax
classifications.
but
what
the
focus
on
women
jurors
caused
the
court
to
lose
sight
of
what
should
have
been
the
principle
focus.
now
that
action
--
in
that
action,
the
defendant's
crime
was
committed
after
an
altercation
in
which
she
claimed
her
husband
had
insulted
and
humiliated
her
to
the
breaking
point,
convicted
of
second
degree
murder
by
an
all-male
jury.
she
believed
that
women
jurors
might
better
understand
her
state
of
mind
when
she
picked
up
a
baseball
bat
and
administered
the
blow
that
led
to
the
litigation.
the
court
did
not
focus
on
the
denials
of
equal
protection
due
process
to
mrs.
hoyt.
the
focus
was
on
the
benign
nature
of
a
classification
to
women
as
jurors
rather
than
the
unfairness
to
the
litigant.
and
that
viewed
in
that
light,
the
overriding
consideration
really
should
not
be
the
burden
or
the
benefit
of
jury
service
to
perspective
jurors,
but
the
fairness
of
the
system
to
litigants.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
it
provides
an
--
i
think
it
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh!
oh
i'm
sorry.
i
though
you
meant
upper
age
limits.
yes,
certainly
than
18
is
the
age
limit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
70
would
be
the
basis
for
an
exemption,
i
think.
i
don't
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
people
are
off
the
list.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
75
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
of
course,
there
is
a
tremendous
difference
between
age,
which
is
something
that
happens
to
all
of
us
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--
and
sex
which
is
immutable
and
doesn't
change.
and
that's
why
age
classifications
should
not
properly
be
considered
in
the
same
light
as
classification
based
on
a
factor
like
race
or
sex
or
national
origin
something
that
is
not
going
to
happen
to
everybody.
you
put
in
that
status
at
birth
and
you
can't
get
out
of
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
from
(inaudible)
–
[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
well,
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think
that
it
put
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
hoyt
cannot
be
squared
with
these
three
judge
court
decision.
this
three
judge
court
said
in
hoyt
was
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
sterile
precedent
and
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
and
i
think
that
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there
after
all
women
are
like
men
so
they
represented
a
cross
section
so
it
can
be
achieved
by
having
men
represent
women.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
this,
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
point
has
acknowledged
that

if
it
were
necessary
to
prove
the
unfairness
in
any
particular
case
that
would
be
virtually
impossible
standard
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
is
a
general
rule
i
believe,
i
mean
not
only
from
(inaudible)
but
from
williams
case
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
it
certainly
wasn't
in
hoyt,
but
there
been
a
lot
of
jury
cases
in
this
court,
carter
against
jury
commission,
williams
against
florida,
talking
about
the
essential
attributes
of
a
jury
trial
and
one
of
the
critical
attributes
is
that
it
would
be
drawn
from
a
representative
cross
section
of
the
community,
something
that
cannot
be
achieved
if
women
are
absent

justice

well,
i
think
that
it
has
come
up
in
at
least
three
context
equal
protection,
due
process,
and
then
specifically,
in
the
context
of
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
a
case
in
this
court?
there
are
several
district
court
decisions.
all
men
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
this
--
i
think
--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
the
court
--
i
think
said
that
in
due
process
discussion
in
the
context
of
the
cross
section
requirement.
what
it
did
say
was
that,
the
absence
of
women
makes
impossible
this
cross
section.
the
cross
section
is
essential
to
the
integrity
of
the
jury
system,
is
inherent
in
due
process
of
law
and
therefore
as
a
safeguard
for
all
litigants.
that
was
the
determination
of
the
court
below
similar
to
the
position
taken
by
justice
marshal
in
peters
v.
kiff.
i
think,
i've
got
no
time
