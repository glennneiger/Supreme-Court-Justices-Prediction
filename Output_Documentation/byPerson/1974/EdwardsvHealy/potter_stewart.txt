justice
potter
stewart
mr.
vick,
what's
the
practical
importance
of
question
of
whether
or
not
this
case
is
moot
to
the?
you're
going
to
be
arguing
the
next
case
which
involves
a
conviction
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
whether
the
same
question
arises
and
where
no
question
of
mootness
could
possibly
exist.
so,
what
is
the
practical
importance
of
this?
justice
potter
stewart
which
we
appreciated
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
just
wondered
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say,
we
agree
that
this
particular
case
was
moot
but
the
same
issue
exist
in
the
next
case,
where
there
can
be
no
question
with
mootness,
isn't
that?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
depart
from
mootness,
you
mean?
justice
potter
stewart
the
class
--
the
class
was
what?
the
plaintiff's
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
that
he
allowed
the
class
of
women
litigants
or
potential
women
litigants?
justice
potter
stewart
civil
and/or
criminal
litigants?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
that
claimed
damage?
what
is
their
claimed
injury?
justice
potter
stewart
why
--
i
thought
the
new
theory
was
that
there's
very
little
difference
between
men
and
women
and
so
why
wouldn't
a
men
jury
be
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
other's
injury?
you
said,
one
was
denial
of
the
equal
protection
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
is
louisiana
--
louisiana
is
unique
as
i
understand
it
from
the
briefs,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
basis
of
hoyt,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
the
present
status
mrs.
ginsburg
of
the
proposed
equal
rights
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
79?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
requires
a
how
many
states?
justice
potter
stewart
38
and
it's
been
ratified
by
30?
justice
potter
stewart
33.
justice
potter
stewart
two
and
you're
including
those
two
in
the
33?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you're
including
those
two
in
the
33?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there
are
at
least
five
to
go
between
now
and
1979?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
have
affirmatively
rejected?
justice
potter
stewart
can
later
approve?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
long
it
is
done
before
1979
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
date
of
1979?
justice
potter
stewart
the
--
i
asked
that
because
i'm
reminded
that
there
is
some
discussion
of
that
proposal
amendment
in
the
frontiero
opinion
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
what?
justice
potter
stewart
oh.
justice
potter
stewart
in
there
any
variation
among
the
counties
or
parishes
is
i
guess
you
call
them
in
louisiana?
justice
potter
stewart
anywhere,
in
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
hoyt
against
florida
was
decided
less
than
13
years
ago?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
a
unanimous
court?
justice
potter
stewart
you
seem
to
could
it
really
cavalierly,
talking
about
it's
purported
justification
and
so
on
--
justice
potter
stewart
louisiana
has
age
limits
against
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
can
a
two-year-old
child
serve
--
justice
potter
stewart
18?
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
the
draft
proposal
i
think
it
says
some
70,
over
70?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there's
a
--
if
a
75-year-old
man
is
a
litigant?
does
he
have
a
lawsuit?
that
he
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
he
didn't
got
any
jury
of
his
peers
--
justice
potter
stewart
75-year-old
man
or
a
woman?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
some
few
exemptions.
justice
potter
stewart
worry
about
the
favor
sometime?
