mr.

i
please
the
court.
i'm
kendall

assistant
attorney
general,
state
of
louisiana
for
governor
edwards
and
others.
this
case
was
brought
by
miss
healy
and
others
to
challenge
the
louisiana
constitution
and
statutes,
exempting
women
from
service
on
juries
unless
they
filed
a
written
declaration
of
desire
to
serve.
this
matter
was
heard
before
a
three-judge
panel
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana
comprised
of
judges
wisdom
from
the
fifth
circuit,
judges
rubin
and
blake
west
from
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana.
they
found
hoyt
florida
decided
by
this
court
in
1961,
a
sterile
precedent,
no
longer
binding
and
held
that
the
constitution
and
statutory
provisions
of
louisiana
unconstitutional
as
a
denial
of
due
process.
after
appeal
in
this
case
had
been
perfected,
the
people
of
the
state
of
louisiana
adopted
a
new
constitution
which
the
attorney
general
believes
will
moot
the
issue
presently
before
the
court,
january
1,
1975.
we
filed
a
supplemental
memorandum
and
type
written
and
a
supplemental

printed
reflecting
those
changes.

which
is
a

transcript
of

on
the
36-day
on
august
24,
1973,
which
deals
with
this
particular
section
of
the
new
constitution

evidences,
the
overwhelming
intention
of
that
body
made
up
of
a
132
citizens
of
the
state
of
louisiana,
that
women
be
called
for
jury
duty
on

exhibit

in
the
supplemental
brief

25
is
a
draft
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
implementing
the
intention
of
the
convention.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
i
dare
say,
if
i
please
the
court,
is
very
much
like
a
draft
opinion
that
you
would
circulate
to
your
brother
and
i
checked
with
the
director
of
the
judicial
counsel
and
also
with
justice
tate,
who
is
the
author
of
this
order,
on
friday
and
he
said
they
was
still
being
circularized
to
his
brother.
i
might
add
in
an
further
answer
to
your
question
your
honor,
i
was
a
delegate
to
the
constitutional
convention.
justice
tate,
associate
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
was
a
delegate
to
the
convention.
he
is
the
author
of
this
draft
order
and
i
have
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
order
will
be
in
substantial
form
the
way
it
appears
here.
furthermore,
on
friday
--
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
i
don't
presume
to
do
so.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
i
don't
presume
to
do
so.
i
was
only
reflecting
--
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
that
is
a
fact.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
as
of
friday,
i
have
nothing
more
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
as
of
today,
nothing
more.
this
morning
--
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
yes,
your
honor
i
do.
i
was
about
to
say
that
on
friday
the
attorney
general
issued
an
opinion
to
all
clerks
of
court
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
directing
them
to
put
women
in
the
wheel
and
in
anticipation
of
january
1.
i
do
not
obviously
have
a
--
did
not
have
time
to--
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
yes,
your
honor.
this
morning,
i
was
served
with
a
reply
to
our
brief
suggesting
mootness
and
i
would
like,
if
the
court
please,
to
reject
those
portions
that
the
miss
ginsburg
has
raised
out
of
hand
because
she
has
said,
“while
the
volunteers
only
provision
for
female
jury
services
not
retained
in
the
text
of
the
new
constitution,
nothing
there
in
precludes
continuation
of
the
same
exemption.”
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
intention
of
the
convention
and
furthermore,
it
directs
the
louisiana's
supreme
court
to
provide
by
rule
for
exemption
of
jurors.
no
provision
to
become
operative
at
midnight
on
december
31,
1974,
caused
change
in
existing
system.
i
disagree,
i
think
it
most
certainly
does
and
the
attorney
general
has
already
taken
steps
in
that
direction
as
indeed
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
louisiana.
and
on
page
2,
she
says,
“the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
held
time
and
again
that
exemption
at
issue
in
the
instant
case
is
neither
a
rational
nor
discriminatory.”
may
it
please
the
court,
the
supreme
court
louisiana
was
following
the
guidelines
set
down
in
hoyt
and
i
don't
think
they
could
do
anymore
or
any
less.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
well,
that's
--
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
practical
importance
is
to
bring
the
court
to
the
court's
attention
pursuant
of
the
rules
of
this
court.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
any
change.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
now,
our
position
is
whatever
the
court
has
of
course
is
a
matter
for
--
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
court.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
that's
correct.
but
of
course
the
appellants
in
that
cases
seeking
reversal
of
a
conviction.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
it's
possible.
that's
always
a
possibility.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
yes.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
the
only
problem
--
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
indeed.
the
only
problem
i
have
with
that
your
honor
is
that
when
this
man
was
tried
hoyt
was
good
law
and
i
assume
its
still
is
good
law.
now,
that's
the
only
promise
the
state
of
louisiana
would
have.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
in
the
district
court?
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
yes,
you
honor.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
indeed,
they
did.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
it
is
indeed.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
well,
they
have
been
from
time
to
time.
conversely
your
honor,
the
facts
surrounding
the
conviction
in
the
other
case,
i
think
might
lend
itself
to
a
cry
of
passion
of
prejudice
if
indeed
there
were
women
in
the
jury,
but
i
suppose
we'll
get
into
that
then.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
it
could
indeed.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
yes
sir.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
yes,
you
honor.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
well,
your
honor.
i'm
almost
prepared
to
concede
that
on
the
basis
some
decisions
that
have
been
handed
by
this
court
recently.
however,
it
is
an
arguable
point.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
not.
mr.
kendall
l.
vick
not
under
the
present
constitution.
may
it
please
your
honor,
if
you
will
read
that
is
the
entire
purpose
of
taking
out
the
legislators'
hands.
mr.
ambrose
lamprey,
who
introduced
the
resolution
making
it
a

what
it
does
now
in
the
present
and
in

said
unequivocally
that
he
want
to
take
out
the
hands
of
the
legislature
and
putting
it
in
the
hands
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.

you.
mr.
kendall

no,
