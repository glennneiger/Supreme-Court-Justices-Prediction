justice
byron
r.
white
we
still
have
your
opinion
as
to
what's
going
to
happen?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
you
think
that
the
defendant
in
the
next
case
could
loose
that
case
and
excluded
potential
women's
jurors
could
win
this
case
as
an
equal
protection
matter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
just
legally
and
logically
it
could
happen
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
doesn't
make
some
difference
to
whether
this
case
is
moot
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
other
case
may
not
determine
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
ground
do
you
think
the
--
in
this
case,
didn't
the
court
find
this
settled
down
on
the
--
on
potential
litigants
as
the
ones
with
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
wasn't
the
rationale
of
the
court
that
there
was
such
an
opportunity
for
bias,
for
biased
jurors
that
the
exclusion
of
women
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
a
due
process
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
--
most
due
process
decisions
retroactive?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
could
be
a
sixth
amendment
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a
due
process,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
it
could
be
a
sixth
amendment
through
the
due
processes,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
may
be
different
than
a
--
the
due
process
decision
that
has
been
rendered
by
the
three-judge
district
court,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
volunteers
only,
would
that
continue
after
january
1st,
until
there
was
a
supreme
court
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
potential?
just
potential,
none
of
them
are
accidentally
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
source
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
provision
of
the
constitution
21.08?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
the
state
could
try
these
civil
cases
without
any
jury
at
all
as
far
as
any
decision
this
court
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
assume
but
by
the
time
this
case
is
decided
there's
a
new
rule
in
louisiana
that
does
not
exclude
with
women
amenity
that
exactly
like
with
respect
jury
duty,
would
this
case
of
the
moot
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
answer
my
question.
let's
assume
that
women
and
men
are
treat
exactly
alike
under
whatever
new
rules
adopted
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
of
your
women
plaintiffs
would
be
eligible
--
will
be
treated
just
like
men.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
your
litigants
and
your
civil
litigants
would
have
a
right
your
potential
litigants
and
litigants
will
have
had
their
cases
tried
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
have
--
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
case
would
be
pretty
empty,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
true
that
the
rule
that
is
circulating
is
what
represented
to
the
circulating
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
that
rule
becomes
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
any
of
you
--
have
any
of
your
actual
women
litigants
have
their
cases
tried
yet?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
don't
ask
this
to
pass
on
the
standing
of
any
other
group
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
supporting
the
decision
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
not
difficult
if
he
says,
a
potential
woman
who
wants
to
serve
on
the
jury
claiming
she's
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law.
all
she
has
to
do
is
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
did
pass
up
their
standing.
the
standing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
hoyt
put
a
rest
of
any
claims
at
that
time
anyway
that
there
was
something
bias
about
juries
without
women
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
that
respect
--
in
that
respect
the
hoyt
can't
hardly
be
squared
can
it
with
this
three-judge
court
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
can
talk
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
talk
about,
i
mean,
there
are
other
reasons,
that
if
it
talked
about
hoyt
another
jury
cases,
will
you
focus
on
the
equal
protection
ramifications
of
excluding
some
potential
jurors
from
serving
on
the
jury
without
records
to
who
the
defendant
is
or
what
the
consequences
to
the
defendant
might
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
hoyt
involved
the
woman
defendant
in
a
criminal
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
question
was
--
one
of
the
questions
was,
whether
exclusion
of
women
--
that
there
was
an
unfair
jury
not
whether
there
are
some
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
judge
--
the
judgment
you're
defending
is
that
excluding
women
means
they
are
unfair
bias
juries?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what's
happen
since
hoyt?did
they
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
juries
without
women
on
are
more
unfair
today
than
they
were
15
years
ago?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what's
happened
to
say,
that
in
enough
cases
it
happened
that
you
want
to
have
a
general
rule
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wasn't
in
hoyt?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
representative
cross
section
requirements
more
related
to
equal
protection
than
the
due
process
in
the
sense
of
unfairness,
equal
protection
and
the
sense
of
protecting
members
of
the
community
from
exclusion
from
jury
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
know
of
a
case
that
says
because
of
the
--
because
of
the
lack
of
a
fair
cross
section
just
generally
unfair
cross
section
that
you
conclude
that
there
is
a
unfair
and
unfairness
in
the
jury
in
the
sense
that
it
is
biased
or
that
there
could
be
an
unreliable
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
lot
of
them
--
there
are
a
lot
of
them
that
say
that
you
have
to
have
fair
cross
sections.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
interest
you're
taking
about
that
requirement
furthers?
now,
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
this
district
judge
didn't
say
that
the
problem
here
was
a
cross
section
problem
and
it
was
a
problem
excluding
women
and
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
jury
without
women
on
it
trying
a
woman
defendant
would
be
unfair.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
still
have
your
opinion
as
to
what's
going
to
happen?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
don't
you
think
that
the
defendant
in
the
next
case
could
loose
that
case
and
excluded
potential
women's
jurors
could
win
this
case
as
an
equal
protection
matter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
just
legally
and
logically
it
could
happen
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
doesn't
make
some
difference
to
whether
this
case
is
moot
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
other
case
may
not
determine
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
ground
do
you
think
the
--
in
this
case,
didn't
the
court
find
this
settled
down
on
the
--
on
potential
litigants
as
the
ones
with
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
wasn't
the
rationale
of
the
court
that
there
was
such
an
opportunity
for
bias,
for
biased
jurors
that
the
exclusion
of
women
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
a
due
process
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
--
most
due
process
decisions
retroactive?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
could
be
a
sixth
amendment
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
a
due
process,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
it
could
be
a
sixth
amendment
through
the
due
processes,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
may
be
different
than
a
--
the
due
process
decision
that
has
been
rendered
by
the
three-judge
district
court,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
volunteers
only,
would
that
continue
after
january
1st,
until
there
was
a
supreme
court
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
only
potential?
just
potential,
none
of
them
are
accidentally
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
source
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
provision
of
the
constitution
21.08?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
the
state
could
try
these
civil
cases
without
any
jury
at
all
as
far
as
any
decision
this
court
is
concerned?
justice
byron

let
assume
but
by
the

this

is
decided
there's
a

would
this
case
of
the
moot
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
answer
my
question.
let's
assume
that
women
and
men
are
treat
exactly
alike
under
whatever
new
rules
adopted
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
of
your
women
plaintiffs
would
be
eligible
--
will
be
treated
just
like
men.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
your
litigants
and
your
civil
litigants
would
have
a
right
your
potential
litigants
and
litigants
will
have
had
their
cases
tried
--
justice
byron
r.
white
would
have
--
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
case
would
be
pretty
empty,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
true
that
the
rule
that

what

justice

have
any

justice
byron

white
and
you
don't
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
don't
ask
this
to
pass
on
the
standing
of
any
other
group
here
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
supporting
the
decision
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
not
difficult
if
he
says,
a
potential
woman
who
wants
to
serve
on
the
jury
claiming
she's
denied
equal
protection
of
the
law.
all
she
has
to
do
is
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
did
pass
up
their
standing.
the
standing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
hoyt
put
a
rest
of
any
claims
at
that
time
anyway
that
there
was
something
bias
about
juries
without
women
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
that
respect
--
in
that
respect
the
hoyt
can't
hardly
be
squared
can
it
with
this
three-judge
court
decision?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
can
talk
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
talk
about,
i
mean,
there
are
other
reasons,
that
if
it
talked
about
hoyt
another
jury
cases,
will
you
focus
on
the
equal
protection
ramifications
of
excluding
some
potential

from
serving
on
the
jury
without

to
who
the
defendant
is
or
what
the
consequences
to
the
defendant
might
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
but
hoyt
involved
the
woman
defendant
in
a
criminal
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
question
was
--
one
of
the
questions
was,
whether
exclusion
of
women
--
that
there
was
an
unfair
jury
not
whether
there
are
some
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
judge
--
the
judgment
you're
defending
is
that
excluding
women
means
they
are
unfair
bias
juries?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what's
happen
since
hoyt?did
they
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
juries
without
women
on
are
more
unfair
today
than
they
were
15
years
ago?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what's
happened
to
say,
that
in
enough
cases
it
happened
that
you
want
to
have
a
general
rule
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
wasn't
in
hoyt?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
representative
cross
section
requirements
more
related
to
equal
protection
than
the
due
process
in
the
sense
of
unfairness,
equal
protection
and
the
sense
of
protecting
members
of
the
community
from
exclusion
from
jury
service?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
know
of
a
case
that
says
because
of
the
--
because
of
the
lack
of
a
fair
cross
section
just
generally
unfair
cross
section
that
you
conclude
that
there
is
a
unfair
and
unfairness
in
the
jury
in
the
sense
that
it
is
biased
or
that
there
could
be
an
unreliable
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
lot
of
them
--
there
are
a
lot
of
them
that
say
that
you
have
to
have
fair
cross
sections.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
interest
you're
taking
about
that
requirement
furthers?
now,
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
this
district
judge
didn't
say
that
the
problem
here
was
a
cross
section
problem
and
it
was
a
problem
excluding
women
and
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
a
jury
without
women
on
it
trying
a
woman
defendant
would
be
unfair.
