mr.
armand
derfner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
crusade
for
voters
of
richmond,
one
of
the
intervenors
here.
we
believe
this
is
the
type
of
case
that
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
was
designed
to
deal
with.
on
the
surface,
we
have
a
normal
annexation
purported
to
be
for
legitimate
ends
to
help
a
city
through
some
of
the
problems
that
a
number
of
cities
go
through
in
this
day
and
age.
on
the
surface
then
it
is
like
nearly
a
thousand
other
annexations
that
have
gone
through
under
the
voting
rights
act
with
no
problems.
in
fact
though,
this
annexation
was
and
remains
a
deliberate
effort
on
the
part
of
the
city
to
negate
the
gains
made
by
black
voters
under
the
voting
rights
act.
when
congress
enacted
section
5,
added
section
5
to
the
voting
rights
act
in
1965,
it
did
so
because
as
the
testimony
in
the
legislative
history
shows
congress
well
knew
that
the
history
of
voting
discrimination
had
been
the
inventive
development
of
new
stratagems
to
cope
with
--
to
make
certain
that
white
political
control
was
maintained
and
that
discrimination
against
black
voters
was
maintained
after
the
existing
stratagems
were
struck
down,
so
that
section
5
was
in
effect
a
counterpart
of
section
4
which
mandated
the
elimination
of
test
and
devices.
and
in
fact
in
richmond,
what
we
have
is
a
situation
where
the
growth
of
black
voting
strength,
the
overcoming
by
black
voters
of
the
history
of
discrimination
against
them
which
occurred
as
the
60's
grew
on
and
especially
with
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act
was
suddenly
aborted
in
1970,
1969
actually
took
effect
in
1970.
mr.
armand
derfner
not
to
my
understanding,
i
maybe
mistaken
of
my
impression
--
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
hill
was
elected
in
1948
or
1950
in
the
very
early
days
after
his
one
term
in
office
there
was
no
black
councilman
until
after
the
passage
of
the
voting
rights
act,
i
believe
1966
or
'68
was
the
next
election
of
black
councilmen.
i'm
sorry
about
forgetting
about
mr.
hill.
the
annexation
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
be
agreed
by
everybody
with
a
possible
exception
of
the
city
did
have
this
bad
purpose.
much
to
the
question
here
turns
on
the
effect.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
noting
that
the
effect
of
this,
the
effect
of
this
annexation
was
if
put
in
population
terms
to
add
the
equivalent
of
one
and
half
white
wards
or
one
and
half
wards
of
white
voters
to
the
city.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
my
position
--
the
position
of
the
crusade
is
that
in
order,
is
that
the
act
requires
that
the
city,
if
it
is
to
gain
a
declaratory
judgment
prove
that
it
does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect
that
both
of
those
are
independent
tests
and
then
yet
in
the
absence.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
not
at
all
--
mr.
armand
derfner
well,
it
is
that
presumably
that
counts.
they
are
presumably
that
counts,
right.
but
i
think
that
the
city
in
order
to
disprove
bad
purpose
or
to
show
that
the
bad
purpose
has
been
dispelled
must
do
something
more
than
show
some
minimization
or
some
degree
of
amelioration
of
a
bad
effect.
i
think
that
the
government
seems
to
agree
with
the
crusade
and
with
the
court
that
there
have
to
be
some
independent
proof
that
the
bad
purpose
has
been
dispelled.
one
of
the
items
of
that
proof
would
be
a
showing
that
the
annexation
has
or
had
a
what
the
court
an
objectively
verifiable
legitimate
purpose
and
i
think
to
my
mind,
this
is
the
same
standard
was
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
white
in
his
opinion
in
the
palmer
case
when
he
used
the
phrase
"colorable
nondiscriminatory
reason."
i
think
the
government
has
highlighted
the
problem
of
the
purpose.
i
simply
disagree
with
the
inferences
it
draws
from
the
state
of
the
evidence
below.
the
government
in
effect
says,
we
think
the
evidence
below
wasn't
clear,
we
think
there
ought
to
be
a
new
hearing
in
effect.
what
that
means
to
me
is
that
the
city
didn't
meet
its
burden,
not
only
did
it
meet
its
burden
but
cannot
now
show
what
it
would
have
to
show
to
gain
a
reversal
in
that
ground
that
is
at
the
findings
of
the
special
master
and
the
district
court
on
purpose
were
clearly
erroneous
that
the
city
can't
meet
that
standard
that
it
didn't
meet
its
burden
of
proof
in
the
district
court.
therefore,
to
me
what
the
government
is
saying
is
that
although
the
city
has
failed
to
meet
its
burden
of
proving
sound
purpose
below,
it
should
be
entitled
because
we,
the
government
or
the
united
states
think
that
that
evidence
might
be
available
to
it.
well,
that
suggestion
of
a
new
trial,
i
suppose
is
a
matter
of
equity
and
a
matter
of
procedure
to
be
determined
by
the
district
court
below
in
the
first
instance
to
be
determined
perhaps
by
this
court
on
review
but
i
don't
think
there
should
be
any
confusion
about
what
it
amounts
to
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
amounts
clearly
to
a
recognition
of
the
fact
that
the
record
below
shows
that
there
isn't
any
evidence
or
isn't
enough
evidence
for
the
city
to
meet
its
burden
of
showing
an
objectively
verifiable
legitimate
purpose
and
therefore
or
that
being
one
of
the
elements
of
showing
that
the
bad
purpose
has
been
dispelled.
but
i
think
as
a
starting
point,
what
the
government
says
amounts
to
a
recognition
the
city
failed
to
meet
its
burden.
if
it
failed
to
meet
its
burden
under
the
act
there
is
no
choice.
the
district
court
did
not
have
the
right
or
the
power
to
grant
the
declaratory
judgment.
now,
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
about
the
effect
and
about
what
is
the
consequence
of
the
city's
adoption
of
the
nineward
plan.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
a
brief
reference
to
the
question
that
has
come
up
for
the
first
time
today
that
is
what
is
the
legal
consequence
of
the
attorney
general's
acquiescence
or
his
agreement
that
a
particular
form
of
submission
or
consent
judgment
is
appropriate.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
don't
think
it
was
presented
in
any
full
sense.
my
recollection
is
--
mr.
armand
derfner
well
my
recollection
--
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white.
my
recollection
is
that
the
city
prepared
the
plan
and
prepared
a
cover
consent
judgment
which
had
circulated
at
the
attorney
general
or
his
representative
signed
--
that
the
representative
--
two
intervenors
did
not
sign.
that
the
city
then
submitted
the
matter
--
submitted
that
judgment
as
a
proposed
consent
judgment
to
the
district
court
and
that
the
two
intervenors
filed
brief
memoranda
saying
that
they
didn't
agree
and
thought
it
should
be
accepted
since
it
did
not
have
the
consent
of
all
parties
in
the
case.
as
far
as
i
know
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
there
was
no
legal
argument
nor
any
memoranda,
nor
any
further
effort
by
the
city
to
argue
that
point.
i
would
say
this
on
that
subject
that
i
think
the
structure
of
section
5
was
initially,
exclusively
or
initially
created
an
exclusive
remedy
for
the
city
in
the
district
court
by
declaratory
judgment
that
during
the
hearings
in
the
senate,
as
i
recall,
attorney
general
katzenbach
was
asked,
â€œwouldn't
this
be
a
great
burden
for
a
number
changes
that
would
be
quite
minor?"
and
he
acknowledged
that
it
probably
would
be
and
it
was
after
that
--
while
the
hearings
were
going
on
that
the
government
came
back
or
the
legislative
draftsman
of
the
justice
department
came
back
with
the
proviso
which
is
now
in
section
5.
it
was
initially
understood
i
believe
that
the
proviso
would
be
a
limited
remedy
and
that
the
declaratory
judgment
would
be
a
predominant
one
as
it
has
happened
mechanically,
it
is
going
the
other
way
around.
mr.
armand
derfner
but
this
court
in
georgia,
in
the
georgia
case
made
it
clear
that
the
attorney
general
operates
as
a
surrogate
for
the
court,
as
a
substitute
if
you
will
and
i
think
it
would
be
improper
to
say
that
the
surrogate
can
swallow
up
the
court
once
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
attached.
i
would
also
remind
the
court
of
its
brief
reference
in
the
allen
case,
the
very
first
case
dealing
with
a
submission
under
the
voting
rights
act
or
with
a
question
of
whether
something
had
to
be
submitted.
there,
the
attorney
general
of
mississippi
argued,
well,
we
sent
this
change
to
the
attorney
general,
we
never
heard
anything.
therefore,
we
take
it
that
he
has
left
that
60
days
past
and
this
court
talked
about
the
requirement,
the
requisites
of
formality
and
formal
submission.
mr.
armand
derfner
in
the
ordinary
case
that
is
true.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
don't
think
that
the
attorney
--
well,
i
think
that
the
jurisdiction
ones
it
attaches
of
the
district
court.
mr.
armand
derfner
the
only
action
available
at
that
point
would
be
an
action
by
a
voter
presumably
seeking
to
review
under
either
the
administrative
procedure
act
or
under
the
intertices
of
this
act
seeking
to
review
the
attorney
general's
failure
to
object
but
clearly,
there
is
no
question,
but
that
the
declaratory
judgment
court
created
under
section
5
would
not
be
invoked
if
the
attorney
general,
if
the
attorney
general's
fail
--
if
the
attorney
general
had
had
a
submission
and
failed
to
object
without
jurisdiction
having
attached
but
it
seems
that
once
the
courts
jurisdiction
has
attached,
we
have
an
entirely
different
matter.
mr.
armand
derfner
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
unquestionably
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
think
the
last
sentence
was
essentially
a
savings
clause
to
make
it
clear
that
it
preserves
any
case
could
not
be
ousted.
mr.
armand
derfner
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
quite
wrong
to
read
the
statute
is
saying
that
the
attorney
general
can
to
use
a
colloquialism
pull
the
plug
on
a
case
filed
before
an
article
3
court,
a
special
court
created
by
congress.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes.
mr.
armand
derfner
it
sues
the
--
it
sues
united
states.
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
either
sues
the
united
states
or
the
attorney
general,
in
fact,
he's
been
to
sue
both.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
i
think
that
the
court
would
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
don't
think
the
court
is
disempowered
to.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
i
am
saying
i
think
the
court
still
has
at
that
point
has
to
review
and
has
discretion,
i
think
if
not
disempowered
to
dismiss
but
i
don't
think
the
dismissal
automatically
has
to
follow
and
i
think
this
court
has
dealt
with
the
rights
of
--
mr.
armand
derfner
should
never
move
to
dismiss
and
i
would
just
remind
this
court
again
of
its
opinion
in
the
--
its
paired
opinion
i
suppose,
in
pair
of
decisions
in
the
new
york
case
in
which
the
rights
of
the
intervenors
have
been
a
matter
of
great
concern
not
only
to
the
court
but
to
the
justice
department
that
has
been
a
continuing
controversy.
but
i
still
come
back
to
the
point
that
once
the
court's
jurisdiction
is
attached
and
especially
once
intervenors
come
in
and
have
been
led
in
with
i
might
say
the
justice
department's
acquiescence
in
this
case
that
the
court
cannot
simply
be
ousted
by
the
medium
that
might
well
have
been
available
or
would
have
been
available
had
the
court's
jurisdiction
never
attached.
mr.
armand
derfner
any
citizen
withstanding?
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me?
mr.
armand
derfner
it
would
be
a
black
citizen
in
the
ordinary
case.
in
the
exceptional
case
it
might
conceivably
be
a
situation
where
white
citizens
were
discriminated
against.
mr.
armand
derfner
pardon
me.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
no,
i
certainly
don't
mean
to
do
so
and
in
fact
the
suit
that
has
been
brought,
that
was
brought
in
the
eastern
district
was
by
a
black
citizen
seeking
to
assert
his
fifteenth
amendment
rights.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes.
mr.
armand
derfner
that's
the
limit
of
the
point
i
was
seeking
to
make
in
response
to
your
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes
and
they
are
entitled
to
protection,
so
i
was
just
talking
about
the
ordinary
situation
and
the
virginia
situation
being
one
in
which
as
a
practical
matter
white
citizens
have
never
been
discriminated
against
on
account
of
race.
mr.
armand
derfner
unquestionably,
unquestionably.
that
of
course
become
a
somewhat
different
question
when
we're
dealing
with
the
appropriate
remedy
to
be
devised
for
a
situation
where
there
has
been
a
history
of
discrimination
against
one
race
and
that
comes
in
to
this
case
too.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes
it
is,
yes
it
is.
mr.
armand
derfner
but
as
to
the
constitutional
issue,
certainly,
the
fifteenth
amendment
goes
as
we
might
say
both
ways
or
always.
mr.
armand
derfner
let
me
direct
myself
in
the
time
remaining
to
the
question
of
effect.
i
think
unquestionably
the
addition
of
these
45,000
white
people
in
the
context
of
the
population
figures
that
were
existing
in
richmond
had
and
has
a
diluting
effect.
the
question
is
how
that
diluting
effect
is
to
be
overcome
and
i
think
what
the
petersburg
case
said
and
the
way
the
district
court
here
read
the
petersburg
case
is
that
at
least
where
you
have
no
discriminatory
purpose,
you
can
--
you
can
meet
your
burden
as
to
effect
by
making
a
good
faith
showing
that
you
have
minimized
the
dilutive
effect
to
the
extent
possible,
or
to
the
extent
reasonable.
it
is
something
i
suppose
of
reasonable
man
standard.
i
think
the
district
court
here
was
suggesting
and
i
think
there
are
two
things
that
are
different
about
this
case.
first,
i
think
as
the
district
court
suggested
in
footnote
46
of
its
opinion
here,
there
may
well
be
a
different
standard
as
to
how
far
one
must
go
in
ameliorating
effect
where
there
has
been
and
is
a
discriminatory
purpose.
in
other
words,
it
may
be
that
the
phrase
eliminate
dilution
is
appropriate
in
a
discriminatory
purpose
case
whereas
the
phrase
minimize
dilution
would
be
sufficient
in
a
none
in
a
case
that
lack
of
discriminatory
purpose.
and
on
this,
i
think
we
derive
some
support
from
the
majority
opinion
in
the
case
of
wright
versus
city
of
emporia
in
which
there
was
a
discussion
of
the
ways
in
which
a
bad
purpose
or
discriminatory
purpose
can
infect
the
effect
either
by
heightening
the
feelings
of
stigma
or
by
casting
some
glow
or
gloss
on
the
evaluation
of
the
claimed
legitimate
purposes.
that
is
one
thing
but
--
mr.
armand
derfner
i
don't
think
that's
dilution
because
i
think
in
that
large
election
the
sub
position
that
you
might
get
all
nine
or
virtually
all
nine
of
the
councilmen
is
in
a
sense
of
bonus
that
flows
from
the
mechanism
and
to
come
back
from
that
to.
mr.
armand
derfner
yes,
yes,
at
least
in
the
ordinary
situation
where
you
are
not
coming
on
the
heels
of
an
annexation
of
this
sort
and
when
you
are
coming
on
the
heels
of
an
annexation
of
this
sort,
some
different
standards
may
apply.
one
that
i
mentioned
is
the
idea
that
elimination
rather
than
minimization
maybe
required.
a
second
point
i
would
make
though
is
that
in
this
case
i
don't
believe
the
city
has
met
its
burden
of
proving
that
its
nine-member
plan
did
meet
the
effect
test.
i
would
mention
since
my
time
has
expired
just
briefly
that
the
city
refused
and
i
think
the
record
will
show
this.
the
city
refused
to
consider
any
other
plans
once
it
had
its
plan
drawn
and
the
department's
agreement.
they
refused
to
look
at
any
other
plans
although
i
think
it
was
not
only
arguably
but
definitely
under
an
obligation
given
the
background
of
circumstances
to
find
the
best
plan
available.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
crusades
plans
were
not
offered
or
are
not
offered
as
plans
that
are
in
fact
necessarily
better
or
constitutional
or
mandatory
or
anything
like
that,
they
simply
offered
to
show
that
even
under
the
city's
pattern
better
alternatives
were
available.
it
might
be
that
the
proper
plan
would
not
be
won
that
had
four
black,
four
white
in
a
ninth
district
somewhere
in
the
middle.
well,
it
might
be
that
the
better
plan,
the
best
plan
would
be
one
that
had
essentially
no
uni-racial
districts
or
one
or
two
if
that
is
the
best
you
can
draw
given
neighborhoods
with
other
districts
being
in
a
sense
up
for
grabs.
we
simply
sought
to
show
that
even
under
the
cities
pattern
that
a
better
plan
can
be
drawn.
we
don't
believe
that
black
voting
is
an
inevitable
necessity,
the
pattern
has
shown
that
we
are
in
the
most
recent
elections
there
has
been
some
departure
from
that
because
the
crusade
did
support
two
whites
as
well
as
several
black
candidates.
and
i
might
point
out
that
in
judging
the
question
of
enhancement
had
this
annexation
not
taken
place.
the
results
of
the
1970
elections
the
most
recent
elections
would
show
if
we
took
out
the
votes
cast
in
the
annex
area
that
crusade
black
candidates
would
have
had
four
candidate
--
would
have
had
four
seats,
two
whites
who
were
elected,
one
black
was
elected
and
a
fourth
or
a
second
black
or
fourth
person
who
was
elected
in
the
old
city
but
who
was
not
elected
because
he
didn't
finish
high
enough
in
the
annex
area.
i
think
by
a
variety
of
tests
city
didn't
need
its
effect
test,
it
didn't
meet
its
purpose
test
and
i
would
like
to
advert
just
very
for
30
seconds
to
the
government's
suggestion
of
election.
we
too
believe
that
our
election
would
be
highly
appropriate
that
it
has
been
five
years
before
since
an
election
has
taken
place.
but
what
the
government
would
have
us
do
is
to
have
the
plan
which
the
city
was
not
able
to
show
satisfy
the
voting
rights
act
have
that
put
in
to
effect
have
what
amounts
to
a
back
door
or
side
door
disposition
of
what
it
could
not
obtain
through
the
front
door.
and
since
the
upcoming
decisions
will
be
--
will
involve
many
that
affect
the
future
course
of
the
city
of
richmond
and
this
annexation,
i
think
that
it
is
not
proper
to
have
an
election
of
that
sort
if
we
are
to
have
an
election
and
there
are
many
good
reasons
for
having
one.
i
think
that
at
least
for
temporary
purposes
it
will
be
appropriate
to
have
an
election
in
the
old
city
conducted
under
the
old
system.
and
i
realize
that
raises
a
significant
fourteenth
amendment
problems
but
i
think
we
are
in
this
situation.
we're
in
a
very
peculiar
situation.
i
think
peculiar
remedies
may
be
called
for.
this
case
does
not
involve
--
the
decision
of
the
district
court
does
not
mean
that
annexations
of
legitimate
sort
by
cities
legitimately
and
honestly
seeking
to
meet
their
problems
are
in
anyway
hampered.
what
this
case
involves
is
simply
the
appropriate
action
or
the
appropriate
impact
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
the
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
on
those
changes,
which
like
this
one,
it
was
designed
to
deal
with.
mr.
armand
derfner
no,
no.
mr.
armand
derfner
i
don't
think
that
--
no,
i
don't
that's
ruled
out
but
i
think
in
this
case
what
we
had
was
much,
much
more.
any
annexation
that
richmond
might
undertake
or
might
seek
to
undertake
after
this
case
is
over
would
impart
be
based
on
that
goal,
i
suppose
and
that
in
itself
would
not
be
illegitimate.
it's
this
particular
annexation
which
richmond
has
sought
to
clothe
in
the
legitimate
garb
or
annexations
in
general
that
was
infected
by
purposes
far
worse
than
the
one
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
discussed
means.
i
am
sorry,
i
have
over
gone
my
time,
thank
you
very
much.
