of
course,
as
part
of
annexation,
the
populations
of
the
annex
territory
were
not
registered
voters
and
richmond
could
not
have
been?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
two
ways
to
annex
as
i
understand
it,
one
by
majority
of
vote
or
both
the
annexor
or
annexee
and
the
other
by
court
orders,
special
annexation
court
that
is.

summary

in
this
court.
justice
byron

without
an
argument.
justice
byron

white
suppose
there
is
a
city
council
as
elected
at
large
and
the
black
vote
in
the
community
is
potentially
more
than
50%
or
is
more
than
50%.
it
just
hasn't,
the
vote
just
doesn't
get
out,
but
the
vote
is
there
and
then
the
city
is
districted
and
council
members
are
to
be
elected
a
single-member
districts.
it
is
not
argued
after
that
single-member
districts
do
not
maximize
the
potential
black
vote
but
it
is
argued
that
the
black
voting
power
has
been
diluted
because
it
may
not
any
longer
elect
all
of
the
council.
now,
would
that
be
a
--
would
that
be
dilution
in
the
government's
scale
of
values
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
although
the
--
although
blacks
before
could
have
elected
all
the
council
members.
the
fact
that
they
could
only
elect
afterwards
and
assuming
black
voting.
afterwards
only
five
or
six
of
the
council
members
that
wouldn't
be
a
dilution
in
your
book?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
sort
of
a
problem
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
rather
involved
here
because
the
argument
is
that
soon
blacks
could
have
controlled
the
city
council
and
elect
and
had
a
majority
in
the
instance?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
--
the
government
under
this
has
been
administering
the
statute
to
say
i
understand
--
i
would
gather
that
even
if
in
your
judgment
there
is
no
dilutive
effect,
no
bad
effect
at
all,
a
bad
purpose
would
still
upset
a
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
is
perfectly
--
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there's
bad
effect,
you
don't
have
to
have
a
bad
purpose
too.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
other
way
around,
i
suppose
the
cases
are
few
in
far
between
where
there
is
no
bad
effect
but
--
yet
there's
a
bad
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
you
are
willing
to
remand
on
purpose
even
though
you
think
there
is
no
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you
would
say
it
depends
whatever
the
effects
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
nine-member
council.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
almost
under
these
very
peculiar
statutes,
you
could
almost
make
a
stronger
argument
than
that
i
should
think
that
the
attorney
general's
agreement
to
the
stipulation
almost
remove
jurisdiction
from
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
no
need
for
a
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
the
ward
plan
that
the
three-judge
court
talks
about,
isn't
that
the
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
master
have
that
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
page
18,
it
says
richmond
undertook
the
development
ward
plan
after
the
decision
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
and
it
now
relies
on
petersburg
to
argue
that
the
annexation
was
made
lawful
by
the
adoption
of
a
single-member
district
plan,
is
that
the
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
suggest
that
because
there
was
at
one
time
a
bad
purpose
that
it
is
forever
bad
and
incurable.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
the
argument
here
is
that
a
plan
or
change
and
vision
it
had
a
bad
purpose
and
a
bad
effect
that
the
argument
is
no
longer
has
either
one
of
them
because
the
effect
has
been
cured
and
presumably
the
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
issue
ever
presented
to
this
three-judge
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
attorney
general's
agreement
ousted
the
court's
power?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
one
of
the
questions
presented
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
two
parties
in
the
case
where
the
city
brings
the
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
who
does
it
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
it
sues
the
--
one
now
and
then,
let's
assume
two
weeks
after
the
case
is
filed,
there
the
plaintiff
moved
to
dismiss
it.
you
think
the
court
is
disempowered
and
grant
the
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
city
has
made
a
settlement
with
the
attorney
general
and
he
just
moves
to
dismiss?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
he
would
say
because
the
attorney
general
in
the
city
will
just
pull
the
plug
on
the
case
or
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
fact
is
that
the
city
never
moved
to
dismiss
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
view
of
the
question
i
asked
your
colleague,
if
there
is
a
city
council
elected
at
large
and
the
blacks
have
potential
majority
or
an
actual
majority
and
then
the
city
is
single
districted
so
that
the
blacks
can
no
longer
elect
all
of
a
council.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
single
districting
as
long
as
the
single
districts
weren't
drawn
to
dilute
themselves
to
black
power
would
be
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
arguably
it's
jurisdictional.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
the
attorney
general
in
the
city
now
have
agreed.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
the
effect
that
the
attorney
general
was
drew
from
the
consent
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
argue
--
do
you
argue
the
mere
fact
of
converting
from
a
multimember
to
a
permanent
large
to
a
single
member
district
system
had
a
dilutive
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
tell
me
--
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
purpose
was
to
use
a
single
member
district
plan
to
maintain
white
supremacy,
how
would
it
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it's
the
type
of
a
single
member
plan
is
the
way
they
drew
their
districts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
you
said
per
se,
you
wouldn't
say
that
a
single
member
district
plan
was
dilutive
even
though
if
it
were
at
large
the
blacks
might
get
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean
you
don't
like
what?
you
might
not
like
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
quite
clear.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
richmond
case,
74-201,
with
--
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
was
asked
to
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
to
the
effect
that
an
annexation
by
the
city
of
richmond
have
neither
the
purpose
nor
effect
of
denying
the
right
to
vote
to
the
negro
minority
when
the
city
of
richmond
annexed
certain
parts
of
chesterfield
county,
a
suburban
area.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
of
the
appeal.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
district
court
that
the
annexation
has
finely
conceived
have
the
effect
of
denying
the
right
to
vote.
we
are
also
sufficiently
unsure
that
it
had
the
purpose
--
that
it
had
such
a
purpose
that
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings
with
respect
to
the
purpose
of
the
annexation
in
the
light
of
present
conditions.
these
conclusions
are
more
fully
explained
in
the
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
