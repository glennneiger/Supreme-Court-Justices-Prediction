mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
suit
for
a
declaratory
judgment
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965
brought
by
the
city
of
richmond
seeking
a
declaratory
judgment
that
the
voting
changes
resulting
from
an
annexation
made
by
the
city
in
1970
would
not
have
the
purpose
or
effect
of
abridging
the
right
to
vote
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
annexation
added
23
square
miles
to
the
city
containing
45,700
and
some
white
persons
and
1,500
and
some
blacks.
it
changed
the
composition
of
the
cities
electorate
from
--
of
the
cities
population,
pardon
me,
from
52%
black
to
42%
black,
and
the
composition
of
the
sittings
voting
age
population
from
44.8%
black
to
37.3%
black.
the
annexation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
the
voting
age
population
according
to
census
figures.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
from
44.8
to
37.3,
those
are
the
only
figures
available
the
census
figures
of
population
by
age,
we
don't
have
figures
unregistered
voters
by
race.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
in
richmond
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
the
annexation
was
the
culmination
of
long
efforts
which
are
recounted
in
detail
in
the
briefs
and
which
i
won't
take
the
time
to
rehearse
here.
the
reply
brief
filed
by
the
appellant,
city
of
richmond
has
a
chronology
of
all
the
events
in
this
complex
litigation
beginning
on
page
12,
which
is
quite
helpful.
basically,
there
were
studies
that
began
in
the
1950
showing
a
need
in
the
view
of
many
for
annexation
because
of
changes
in
the
composition
of
the
city
exodus
of
young
affluent
persons,
the
many
references
that
the
city
was
becoming
a
place
of
the
poor
and
the
old
and
the
black.
and
throughout
the
course
of
proceedings,
there
was
a
need
for
land
that
could
be
developed
and
there
was
a
problem
about
the
tax-based
of
the
city.
after
an
unsuccessful
effort
to
merge
with
henrico
county
the
annexation
suits
were
brought
in
1961
against
both
henrico
and
chesterfield
counties.
the
one
against
henrico
proceeded
first
and
resulted
in
an
ward
by
the
annexation
court
which
the
city
found
unacceptable,
indications
are
because
of
the
heavy
payment
that
would
have
to
be
made
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
the
merger
was
the
former
method
and
while
the
city
voters
voted
for
it,
the
county
voters
did
not.
so
the
annexation
suits
were
then
brought
and
when
the
henrico
suit
culminated
in
an
unacceptable
ward,
the
city
proceeded
with
the
chesterfield
suit,
which
was
then
compromised
and
we
what
we
have
before
as
a
result
of
the
compromise.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no
sir,
we
haven't
planned
to
do
that.
i
am
going
to
speak
of
all
the
issues.
the
district
court
found
the
annexation
invalid
in
both
purpose
and
effect
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of
the
fact
then
the
question
of
purpose
and
then
our
view
with
the
proper
disposition
of
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
have
changed
our
position
in
the
litigation
as
a
result
of
modifications
of
the
plan
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
has
been
a
submission
to
us
and
we've
interposed
no
objection.
when
we
reached
our
agreement
with
the
city,
mr.
rhyne
quite
properly
raised
that
question
with
us.
well,
can't
he
just
now
submit
the
plan
to
the
attorney
general
and
we
took
the
position
that
it
would
be
improper
for
us
to
abort
the
suit
that
way
that
once
the
matter
was
pending
in
court
that
we
let
the
court
decide
whether
the
act
has
been
complied
with
or
not.
we're
a
party
to
the
litigation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
are
two
intervenors
who
didn't
agree
with
the
compromise
and
we
just
took
the
position
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
--
yes,
there
have
been
instances
upheld,
the
el
paso
case
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
being
cited
to
us.
in
any
event,
we
have
not
purported
to
any
litigation.
we
are
taking
a
position
as
a
litigant
in
the
litigation
and
not
a
position
that
the
question
has
been
submitted
to
us
for
clearance
and
we
have
given
it
clearance
under
the
act.
now,
the
question
of
effect,
which
is
the
first
one
to
address
and
the
first
one
addressed
by
the
--
our
brief
turns
on
what
delusion
must
necessarily
occur
in
black
voting
strength
as
a
result
of
the
addition
of
this
largely
white
group
to
the
city's
electorate.
in
this
case,
it
was
because
of
that
dilutive
effect
that
the
attorney
general
refused
to
grant
pre-clearance
upon
the
city
submission
two
weeks
after
this
court's
decision
in
perkins
against
matthews,
which
made
it
clear
that
these
annexations
had
are
covered
by
the
voting
rights
act.
the
annexation
had
already
gone
into
effect
before
the
pre-clearance
was
sought
and
we
suggested
at
the
time
that
if
the
dilutive
effect
could
be
ameliorated
by
changing
from
an
at
large
system
of
electing
councilmen
to
a
single
member
ward
system,
then
we
would
be
glad
to
reconsider
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
it's
1947
if
i
--
48,
1948
the
city
attorney
tells
me.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
with
the
city
manager
system,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
a
nine-member
council.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
were
in
a
situation
where
there
was
an
emerging
black
majority,
which
would
be
frustrated
by
the
annexation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
which
is
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
has
been
one
black
member
of
it
in
more
recent
years.
there
have
been
also
two
white
members
supported
by
the
crusade
for
voters,
which
is
the
predominantly
black
political
organization
in
the
city.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
not
the
traditional
political
parties
and
the
ballot
itself
is
non-partisan
but
there
are
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
organizations
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
support
candidates,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they're
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
up
to
nine-access,
they
are
not
numbered
seats
and
you
don't
have
to
have
a
majority
to
win.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
can
vote
for
as
many
as
he
wants.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
not
proportional
representation
and
in
the
course
of
the
litigation,
since
the
city
brought
the
lawsuit,
still
seeking
approval
for
the
at
large
system
with
the
annexation.
in
the
course
of
litigation,
the
city
in
the
united
states
arrived
at
a
compromised
a
proposed
consent
decree,
which
begins
at
page
150
of
the
appendix,
in
which
a
single
member
ward
system
would
be
set
up
and
in
our
view
this
would
eliminate
any
substantial
diluted
effect
of
the
annexation
and
voting
for
the
city
council.
it
would
result
in
four
districts
with
substantial
black
majorities,
four
districts
with
substantial
white
majorities
and
other
district
in
which
the
proportion
of
blacks
and
whites
is
basically
the
same
as
the
proportion
in
the
city
as
a
whole.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
approximately
equal
population,
they
were
drawn
on
a
nonracial
basis
or
on
the
basis
of
contiguity,
compactness,
sharing
of
interest,
not
having
a
district
crossing
the
james
river
criteria
of
that
sort
which
are
spelled
out
in
some
detail.
now,
the
district
court
nonetheless
has
taken
the
position
that
the
effect
is
one
that's
improper
under
the
act,
under
what
it
refers
to
as
the
rule
or
standard
of
the
petersburg
case,
which
is
also
relied
on
very
heavily
by
the
crusade
for
voters,
one
of
the
intervenors
here
and
they
read
the
petersburg
decision,
which
was
a
decision
by
another
three-judge
court
which
summarily
affirmed
by
this
court
as
holding
that
when
there
is
an
annexation
of
this
sort,
the
ward
plans
have
to
be
drawn
in
such
a
way
as
to
minimize
any
adverse
impact
on
black
voting
strengths,
that
the
black
voting
strength
has
to
be
maximized
to
the
extent
possible
in
the
drawing
of
the
ward
plans
themselves.
we
think
this
is
a
serious
misreading
of
the
petersburg
case
and
i
want
to
take
a
minute
or
two
to
explain
why.
in
that
case,
and
i
have
the
opinion
here
of
the
attorney
general
in
rejecting
the
annexation
in
a
very
similar
situation,
where
there
was
an
at
large
council
system,
wrote
a
letter,
spelling
out
in
detail
of
the
government's
position,
and
that
letter
is
reproduced
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
and
we
explain
that
one
way
to
meet
the
problem
of
dilution
on
the
council,
and
i
am
quoting
from
the
letter
"would
be
to
adapt
a
fairly
drawn
system
of
single
member
wards."
and
that
was
our
position
that
it
would
be
a
fair
representation
for
everyone
for
the
expanded
city
that
was
required,
not
an
effort
at
over
compensating
black
voters
because
of
the
addition
of
others
to
the
community.
now,
in
response
to
this,
the
intervenors
in
petersburg
argued
that
even
if
this
change
were
made
with
respect
to
the
city
council,
the
district
court
should
not
approve
the
plan
in
petersburg,
the
annexation
for
the
reason
that
the
election
of
the
sixth
constitutional
officers
provided
for
in
the
virginia
constitution
would
not
be
affected
and
that
a
lute
of
effect
on
the
black
vote
would
occur
in
the
election
for
the
city
treasurer,
the
sheriff,
the
commissioner
of
revenue,
etcetera.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
--
that
is
correct,
and
that
was
inescapably
an
at
large
vote
and
the
ward
plan
couldn't
do
anything
about
that.
in
response
to
that
argument
as
we
read
the
opinion
in
petersburg,
the
district
court
said,
the
court
concludes
and
i'm
reading
from
the
opinion
in
accordance
with
the
attorney
general's
findings
that
this
annexation
can
be
approved
only
on
the
condition
that
modifications
calculated
to
neutralize
to
the
extent
possible
any
adverse
effect
upon
the
political
participation
of
black
voters
are
adopted
that
is
that
the
plaintiff
shift
from
an
at
large
to
a
ward
system
of
electing
its
city
councilmen.
in
coming
to
this
conclusion
with
respect
to
the
argument
of
the
intervenors
as
to
the
constitutional
officers,
we
take
note
of
several
factors
and
the
court
spelled
out
its
reasons
for
not
construing
the
act
to
black
annexations
in
effect.
now,
we
read
that
language
to
the
extent
possible
as
meaning
with
respect
to
the
officers
where
it
is
possible
to
ameliorate
the
dilutive
effect,
not
that
the
amelioration
itself
has
to
maximize
black
voting
strength.
and
that
is
the
basis
on
which
we
filed
our
motion
to
affirm
in
the
petersburg
case
and
we
don't
believe
that
this
court's
affirmance
has
endorsed
a
principle
that
the
district
court
in
the
present
case
has
said
that
the
petersburg
case
stands
for.
that
there
has
to
be
an
effect
to
maximization
of
black
voting
strength
and
converting
to
ward
system
in
the
way
the
wards
are
drawn
or
what
might
be
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
was
a
summary
affirmance
in
this
court
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
without
argument.
as
i
recall
mr.
justice
douglas
wanted
to
hear
our
argument
in
the
case
and
noted
that
he
wanted
to
hear
our
argument.
it
was
at
410
u.s.
962;
it's
cited
in
the
briefs.
so
basically,
we
feel
that
the
standard
of
petersburg
and
the
standard
that
we
have
been
applying
right
along
in
improving
annexations
and
you
note
a
footnote
in
our
brief
indicates
that
of
--
i
think
it
is
867
annexations
that
have
been
submitted
to
us
under
the
act,
we've
disapproved
only
six.
we
have
been
operating
on
the
premise
that
a
system
of
fair
representation
of
everyone
in
the
annexed
area
is
all
that
is
required
and
if
we
are
wrong
in
that
we
would
like
to
know,
but
we
don't
think
we're
wrong
in
that,
we
don't
think
the
act
was
intended
to
otherwise.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
as
we
have
been
administering
the
act,
we
don't
think
the
act
requires
one
method
of
representation
or
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
that
would
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
might
be
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose
in
making
the
change
but
the
effect
if
the
districts
are
fairly
drawn
would
not
be
in
effect
that
violates
the
act
in
our
view.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
in
our
view
so
far
as
effect
is
concerned
is
made
up
for
by
the
fact
that
the
black
voting
strength
is
being
immediately
enhanced
now.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances,
it
might
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
might
not
any
reason
to
interpose
an
objection
there.
it
is
hard
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
of
this
kind
in
the
abstract
(voice
overlap)
without
hearing
from
interested
persons
who
may
bring
facts
to
our
attention.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
i
think
my
time
is
running
out,
i
just
want
to
summarize
very
briefly
our
position
purpose
and
disposition
and
that
is
that
the
record
does
show
legitimate
purposes
including
a
very
important
effect
that
deannexation
would
have
on
the
school
system
in
richmond,
which
is
not
addressed
at
all
in
the
intervenors
briefs.
we
think
that
the
appropriate
disposition
would
be
to
develop
the
legitimacy
of
this
purposes
and
whether
they
have
purged
the
discriminatory
purpose
that
it
was
shown
on
remand.
in
the
meantime,
it
has
been
five
years
since
there
has
been
an
election
and
we
would
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
something
not
suggested
in
our
brief
that
it
would
be
appropriate
if
a
court
agrees
with
us
that
a
remand
is
the
proper
disposition
on
the
purpose
issue
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
provide
that
an
election
can
be
held
in
the
meantime
pursuant
to
the
consent
agreement
proposed
by
the
united
states
and
the
city,
an
election
from
these
wards
with
the
terms
to
expire
july
1,
1976,
so
that
we
would
have
up-to-date
elected
city
council
in
richmond.
i
don't
think
anyone
would
be
worse
off
than
they
are
with
the
old
council
that
was
elected
in
1970
in
which
replacements
are
being
made
without
elections
by
the
existing
members
of
the
council.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
two-year
term.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
even
numbered
years
so
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
the
city
would
prefer
not
to
wait
until
1976
for
the
next
election
and
we
don't
see
why
they
--
that
need
occur
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
in
virginia.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
precisely
coterminous
so
that
a
deannexation
would
have
something
of
the
effect
that
was
involved
in
the
united
states
against
scotland,
neck
city
board
of
education.
i
don't
really
want
to
exaggerate
the
analogy
but
there
is
a
similar
effect
to
that
case
and
to
gomillion
against
lightfoot
should
there
be
a
deannexation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
replacements
are
being
made.
there
have
been
resignations.
i
don't
know
if
there
has
been
any
death
and
replacements
are
being
made
by
the
remaining
members
of
the
council.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
--
elections
have
been
enjoined
under
first
in
order
of
this
court
in
joining
the
1970
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
the
act
says
that.
i
don't
if
we've
ever
--
i
had
a
case
where
we've
had
to
refuse
to
clear.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
think
that
this
case
is
a
peculiar
example
of
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don'
think
the
party
has
developed
their
evidence
and
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
legitimate
purpose.
once
there
was
a
finding
of
a
bad
purpose,
the
effect
of
which
has
been
ameliorated,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
has
to
be
an
inquiry
into
whether
a
legitimate
purpose
does
justify
this
annexation.
we
think
the
answer
is
fairly
clear
on
the
record
as
it
stands
and
we
are
only
suggesting
the
remand
is
a
matter
of
fairness
because
the
parties
didn't
focus
on
this
issue
this
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
am
not
aware
of
any.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
both
issues
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
plain
language
says
that
we're
not
suppose
to
approve
and
the
district
court
is
not
supposed
to
approve
a
voting
change
that
was
made
for
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose
even
though
it
doesn't
have
a
racial
one.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
regardless
of
the
effect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
so
that
issue
remains
here.
we
think
a
sufficient
showing
was
made
considering
that
especially
that
the
parties
have
stipulated
that
the
record
in
the
holt
litigation
is
also
part
of
the
record
here.
but
we
have
suggested
the
remand
only
to
give
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
focus
more
specifically
on
the
issue
in
this
case.
