mr.
cabell
venable
it
makes
no
difference
to
me,
your
honor.
mr.
cabell
venable
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
cabell
venable,
i
represent
curtis
holt
sr.
and
the
class
of
black
voters
in
the
city
of
richmond.
mr.
holt's
involvement
with
this
annexation
goes
back
to
before
the
annexation
actually
took
place.
his
first
attempt
at
legal
involvement
in
this
case
was
a
telegram
sent
to
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
fall
of
1969
asking
mr.
justice
douglas
to
please
intercede
and
prevent
the
annexation
from
taking
place
on
the
first
of
january
of
1970.
following
that,
he
spent
a
year
on
successfully
seeking
the
aid
of
the
justice
department
on
his
claim
that
this
was
a
racially
motivated
annexation
that
did
no
good
economically
or
in
future
growth
for
the
city
of
richmond
and
had
accomplished
its
sole
purpose
which
was
to
prevent
black
participation
in
the
governmental
affairs
of
the
city
of
richmond.
failing
in
disbarring
and
securing
that
aid
from
the
justice
department,
he
filed
a
suit.
mr.
cabell
venable
thank
you
sir.
mr.
cabell
venable
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
several
points
were
raised
in
arguments
by
the
appellants
and
intervenors
and
the
federal
parties,
the
first
one
dealing
with
mootness,
the
mootness
question
i
think
raised
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
neither
the
city,
nor
the
government
after
submitting
this
attempted
consent
judgment
sought
a
dismissal,
nor
did
they
seek
any
other
affirmative
action
other
than
to
present
it
to
the
court.
mr.
cabell
venable
yes
sir.
i
believe
the
government
--
mr.
cabell
venable
jurisdictional
to
the
court
that
the
attorney
general
has
presented
a
consent
order.
mr.
cabell
venable
i
think
they
agreed
as
to
affect
to
mr.
justice
white,
i
don't
think
they
agreed
the
purpose
and
that's
why
the
attorney
general
went
on
with
the
trial
and
even
suggest
today
that
we
go
back
and
consider
even
more
the
question
of
purpose.
i
think
it
was
only
presented
on
the
issue
of
effect
and
that
the
attorney
general
then
went
on
and
took
evidence
and
reference
to
purpose
and
even
today
doesn't
believe
that
that
focus
was
specific
enough
or
detailed
enough
and
would
ask
this
court
to
remand
for
additional
questions
on
purpose.
so
it's
not
an
approval
nor
is
it
a
failure
to
object.
mr.
cabell
venable
yes
sir,
i
do.
in
my
brief,
i
made
a
remark
that
four
seats
on
city
council
guarantee
physical
control,
i
wish
to
point
to
the
court
that
i'm
in
error
that.
five
seats
can
pass
the
general
approved
budget,
it
requires
six
votes
for
any
special
appropriations.
so,
five
seats
on
the
council
in
the
city
of
richmond
is
physical
control
of
the
city
as
well
as
administrative
control.
i
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
on
the
statement
of
this
case.
this
case
goes
back
to
1950s
and
it
goes
back
specifically
to
1960,
at
which
time,
the
city
of
richmond
attempted
to
enter
into
a
merger
within
the
henrico
county.
the
record
shows
and
the
evidence
is
that
the
city
limited
all
of
its
comments
to
the
officials
of
henrico
county
to
the
question
that
the
city
was
having
a
fast
increasing
black
population
and
they
needed
more
white
people.
it
is
instructive
to
note
that
when
the
merger
vote
was
held,
100%
of
all
black
voter
pressings
in
the
city
of
richmond
voted
no
to
merger.
68%
of
all
mixed
precincts
voted
no
to
merger
and
the
crusade
for
voters
wrote
a
letter
specifying
to
the
governor
and
to
the
press
that
merger
was
a
dilution
and
an
attempted
to
dilution
of
their
vote.
following
that
time,
the
city
filed
two
annexations,
one
against
henrico
and
one
against
chesterfield
and
let
the
chesterfield
annexation
sit
on
the
back
burner.
they
received
a
ward
from
the
henrico
annexation
court
of
16
square
miles
for
$55
million
and
approximately
45,000
people,
white
people.
they
turned
down
that
ward,
not
as
they
suggest
because
it
costs
too
much
money
but
because
they
found
that
the
city
charter
wouldn't
allow
them
to
float
bonds
to
pay
for
annexation.
in
1968,
they
changed
that
law
in
preparation
for
the
upcoming
trial
in
the
chesterfield
case.
in
1965,
following
their
rejection
of
the
henrico
ward,
secret
meetings
began
between
the
city,
the
white
officials
of
the
city
of
richmond
specifically
excluding
any
black
representatives
and
continued
up
until
the
time
of
the
compromised
with
members
of
chesterfield
county
board
of
supervisors
and
their
county
manager.
the
entire
discussion
from
the
very
beginning
was
we
need
white
people.
they
discussed
politics,
the
poll
tax
is
off.
the
blacks
are
increasing
in
their
political
participation.
they
commissioned
two
political
discussions
and
analysis
of
the
1966
and
1968
elections
which
predicted
that
the
blacks
would
receive
at
least
four
possibly
five
seats
in
the
1970
election.
also
during
this
time,
they
tried
an
end
run
with
the
general
legislature
of
virginia,
something
called
the
old
heiser
commission
which
sought
to
allow
the
general
assembly
to
change
the
boundaries
and
the
vice
chairman
went
on
the
stand
which
is
evidence
in
this
case
and
said,
"our
sole
purpose
was
to
keep
the
blacks
from
taking
over
the
city
of
richmond."
to
quote
the
mayor
who
headed
up
the
negotiations
as
long
as
i
am
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
richmond,
“the
niggers
won't
take
over
this
town.”
to
quote
the
mayor
again
in
speaking
to
another
councilman
at
a
meeting
in
virginia
beach,“i
did
what
i
did
in
reference
to
the
compromise
because
the
niggers
are
not
qualified
to
run
the
city
of
richmond.”
and
that
is
the
entire
focus
of
the
city
if
richmond
from
1960
and
it
continues
up
until
today
to
quote
the
present
mayor
of
the
city
of
richmond,
“once
we
get
award
plan
which
he
characterizes
reconstructive
and
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act
expires,
we'll
hold
an
at
large
referendum
and
get
rid
of
that
ward
plan."
the
city
has
resisted
the
award
plan
single
member
districts
from
the
very
beginning
up
to
an
including
the
time
in
which
it
filed
a
suit
in
the
three-judge
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
maintain
the
posture
that
the
original
annexation
was
perfectly
all
right
and
at
large
the
expanded
elections
were
perfectly
fine.
it
was
not
until
after
petersburg
that
they
even
sought
or
acquiesced
an
award
plan
and
then
went
to
the
acquiescent
a
ward
plan
which
the
district
court
below
found
in
and
of
itself
had
a
purpose
to
maintain
white
supremacy
in
the
city
of
richmond.
now,
we
have
proposed
as
a
relief
in
this
case
that
the
proper
remedy
is
deannexation.
i
have
proposed
this
in
the
district
court
of
columbia
i
proposed
in
what's
known
as
holt
two
which
had
still
stayed
since
december
of
1971
where
we
sought
an
injunction
because
the
voting
rights
act
have
not
been
complied
with.
that
maintained
in
holt
one.
the
problem
with
that
position
is
that
we
have
a
basic
assumption
that
an
award
of
the
deannexation
in
this
case
would
result
in
the
end
of
annexation
for
cities
and
that
simply
isn't
the
case.
an
award
of
deannexation
in
this
particular
case
would
uphold
a
dignity
of
the
voting
rights
act
in
1965
would
serve
notice
that
you
can't
go
out
to
“keep
the
niggers
form
taking
over
a
municipal
government
and
serve
that
purpose
well.”
it
would
not
prevent
cities
from
expanding
as
judge
butzner
of
the
fourth
circuit
so
cogently
noted
divestiture,
his
a
word
for
deannexation,
would
not
mean
that
cities
can't
annex
even
where
annexation
would
change
the
racial
percentages
of
the
population.
mr.
cabell
venable
per
se
diluted
effect,
mr.
justice
white,
no
sir,
i
don't
argue
that.
i
argue
that
in
the
context
of
a
purposeful
attempt
to
dilute
--
mr.
cabell
venable
it
would
do
it
this
fashion.
if
you
will
note
that
the
word
plan
submitted
by
the
county
follows
one
and
only
one
natural
boundary
and
that's
the
river.
the
reason
that
follows
the
river
is
to
--
mr.
cabell
venable
yes
sir.
the
way
they
drew
their
districts
plus
it
sets
in
question
of
the
georgia
decision
which
dealt
with
the
potential,
the
access,
the
potential
access
to
the
political
process
award
plan
by
its
very
nature
guarantees
a
maximum.
mr.
cabell
venable
i
would
not
like
it
but
i
think
in
the
context
of
what
we
--
what
the
cases
have
held.
mr.
cabell
venable
i
would
not
like
the
change
of
an
at
large
system
in
the
context
of
your
first
questions
i
believe
earlier
today
that
where
black
citizens
have
played
the
democratic
process,
have
given
adherence
to
the
whole
concept
of
work
within
the
democratic
system
and
have
worked
hard
to
gain
their
political
position
to
have
that
rug
jerked
out
at
he
last
minute
just
when
they
were
within
grasp
of
political
control,
i
think
would
violate
all
the
standards
of
fair
play
in
the
democratic
process.
but
in
answer
to
your
question,
in
a
pure
abstract
going
from
an
at
large
to
a
single
member
is
not
per
se
dilutive
but
you
have
to
look
at
dilution
in
the
context
within
which
the
change
occurs.
now,
in
the
case
of
the
city
of
richmond
going
from
a
ward
plan,
i
mean
from
an
at
large
to
a
ward
on
the
heels
of
what
has
to
be
the
most
classic
case
of
out
and
out
purposeful
disenfranchisement
in
that
context,
i
believe
that
award
system
does
not
cure
nor
even
approach
the
question
of
purpose
or
the
question
of
effect
especially
the
ward
plan
prepared
by
the
city
of
richmond.
the
court
in
dealing
with
that
question
of
the
burden
of
the
city,
it
is
characterized
by
mr.
rhyne
of
the
city
that
that's
an
extra
burden.
actually,
i
think
what
the
court
is
doing
is
relaxing
the
literal
interpretation
of
the
act
which
says
you've
got
two
burdens,
you
got
to
prove
no
purpose,
and
you
got
to
prove
no
effect.
what
the
city,
i
mean,
what
the
court
is
actually
doing
in
that
case
is
saying
there
is
an
exception
to
that
rule,
there
is
an
exception
to
a
literal
interpretation.
and
i
think
the
reasoning
goes
like
this,
that
if
you
have
a
verifiably
objective
legitimate
annexation,
it
serves
all
the
races
of
that
community.
it
serves
all
the
overwriting
governmental
needs
and
purposes,
and
if
it
is
objectively
verifiable
then
and
only
then
do
you
come
back
to
a
petersburg
approach
and
seek
to
eliminate
as
much
as
possible
any
of
the
dilutive
effect
because
if
you
can
eliminate
the
effect
there
is
no
need
to
send
it
back
because
you're
harming
the
entire
governmental
structure
in
so
doing.
mr.
cabell
venable
do
i
support
an
election?
now,
we
have
been
asking
for
an
election,
mr.
justice
brennan,
since
1971.
i
would
not
in
the
old
city.
mr.
cabell
venable
yes
sir.
at
large
in
the
old
city.
the
problem
with
this
case
is
that
it
comes
and
has
come
before
every
court
in
a
posture
that
was
never
envisioned
by
the
voting
rights
act.
it
was
envisioned
by
the
very
clear
language
that
no
change
will
be
implemented
unless
it
has
been
prior
approved.
now,
whether
or
not
the
prior
clearance
situation
is
agreeable,
the
fact
is
that
is
what
the
law
says.
and
yet
the
city
implemented
this
change,
waited
over
a
year
before
it
sought
approval,
was
rejected
within
a
year
and
a
half
only
five
days
from
a
motion
for
some
prejudgment
in
the
holt
ii
did
they
ever
go
to
the
district
court
and
have
never
really
made
a
formal
submission
since
the
beginning,
since
the
very
first
submission.
so,
we're
dealing
with
a
faith
accompli
as
supposed
to
dealing
with
what
this
act
was
supposed
to
be
all
about
to
shift
the
person.
mr.
cabell
venable
i
would
agree
with
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist
except
for
this
fact.
the
facts
of
this
case
show
uncontrovertibly
and
i
think
all
parties
admit
that
the
white
power
structure
of
the
city
of
richmond
set
out
with
one
purpose
in
mind,
and
that
was
to
disenfranchise
the
black
vote
in
the
city
of
richmond.
now,
they
knew
that
the
voting
right
act
covered
changes
which
had
the
effect
of
disenfranchisement.
mr.
cabell
venable
to
effect
voting.
mr.
cabell
venable
be
that
--
be
that
as
it
may,
the
fact
remains
that
once
it
was
clear,
once
it
was
clear
what
did
the
city
do?
it
made
a
submission,
mr.
holt
crusade
made
their
submissions.
it
was
objected
to.
what
did
the
city
do
from
that
point
forward?
nothing.
it
took
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
hearing
to
bring
them
all
the
way
to
washington,
the
district
court
of
columbia
seeking
approval
and
they
still
sought
approval
for
the
original
annexation
and
not
approval
for
some
ward
plan.
now,
i
think
one
thing
that
has
been
missed
here
today
in
argument
is
that
not
only
is
the
purposeful
original
annexation
had
issue
and
it's
effect
and
impact,
but
what
about
the
ward
plan?
the
court
below
found
that
the
ward
plan
itself
operated
as
a
purposeful
device
to
maintain
white
supremacy
in
control
in
the
city
if
richmond.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
city
did
not
carry
its
burden
on
any
point
in
the
lower
court
because
it
cannot
carry
its
burden
in
the
lower
court.
the
objectively
verifiable
legitimacy
of
this
annexation,
all
the
governments
and
the
government
and
the
city's
arguments
deal
with,
well
this
is
a
consequential
incidental
result
of
a
legitimate
annexation.
the
evidence
is
replete,
i
do
not
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
from
the
very
first
day
of
holt
i
which
is
swallowed
up
in
this
case.
the
entire
thrust
of
the
holt
intervenors
has
been
that
one
of
the
most
glaring
examples
of
why
this
annexation
is
a
bad
annexation
is
that
it
serves
absolutely
no
governmental
purpose.
the
government
and
the
city
say
the
courts
recognize
that
annexations
are
inevitable
i
will
assent
to
that.
but
not
this
annexation
was
inevitable
to
approve
by
remand
or
otherwise
this
annexation
with
a
lock
to
the
city
of
richmond
into
the
worst
possible
annexation
they
could
ever
have,
economically,
administratively,
racially,
and
would
serve
notice
that
there
is
a
way
to
avoid
the
prescriptions.
mr.
cabell
venable
yes
sir,
i
am.
mr.
cabell
venable
no
sir,
it
was
not.
what
happened
below
was
that
the
court
merely
said
your
application
for
declaratory
judgment
is
denied.
they
then
went
on
to
say
that
mr.
holt's
request
for
deannexation
had
considerable
merit
took
note
of
the
fact
that
holt
two
which
is
referred
to,
that's
the
voting
rights
case
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
which
is
pending
the
decision
of
this
court
where
we're
asking
for
an
injunction
on
the
question
that
is
covered
hasn't
been
approved.
that
they
knowing
the
local
nuances
of
such
an
order
that
the
mechanics
of
a
deannexation
order
would
be
the
proper
one
to
carry
it
out.
in
other
words,
if
we
deny
the
declaration
then
the
coverage
question
comes
into
focus.
is
it
covered?
yes.
has
it
been
approved?
no.
therefore
it
must
be
in
joined
and
that
court
could
then
have
the
machinery
rather
than
the
district
court
of
columbia
to
carry
it
through.
i'd
also
suggested
that
the
state
court
still
enforced
the
annexation
court
by
agreement
of
the
parties,
the
city
and
the
county
which
also
could
be
used
as
an
arbitrary
for
any
problems.
deannexation
is
a
very
reasonable
remedy.
mr.
cabell
venable
no
i
did
not
sir.
mr.
cabell
venable
i
understand
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
problem
is,
however,
that
like
in
allen
everything
is
here,
no
more
can
really
be
said,
perhaps
the
statement
of
this
court
in
affirming
the
district
court
of
columbia
could
state
the
effect
of
its
ruling.
because
i
foresee
very
sincerely
that
we
will
go
back
with
the
lower
court
has
affirm
as
i
think
it
must
be
and
we
will
go
back
to
holt
ii
and
we
will
then
have
to
fight
the
question
of
coverage
and
whether
or
not
that
court
has
more
jurisdiction
than
this
court
granted
in
the
allen
case
which
is
to
go
into
substance.
mr.
cabell
venable
was
there
a
reason
at
the
time
i
did
not
cross
petition?
yes
sir
because
i
felt
that
it
wasn't
necessary
as
under
allen
where
there
was
not
a
question
of
cross
petition
this
court
said
we
will
--
we
could
send
it
back
but
everything
is
here
we
can
grapple
with
the
problem
now
and
issue
a
ruling
and
then
send
it
back
consistent
with
that.
what
i'm
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
grapple
with
the
remedy
and
send
it
back
consistent
thereto.
i
think
deannexation
is
imminently
reasonable
and
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
requires
no
great
time,
you
talk
about
having
immediate
elections,
this
deannexation
could
occur
in
30
days
by
all
the
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
cabell
venable
yes
it
would
and
i'm
in
error
if
i
have
denigrated
my
rights
in
that
respect.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
