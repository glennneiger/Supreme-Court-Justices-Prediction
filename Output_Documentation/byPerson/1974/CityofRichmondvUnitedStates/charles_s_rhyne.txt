mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
city
of
richmond.
we
ask
that
this
court
approve
as
its
judgment
the
consent
judgment
that
was
worked
by
the
attorney
general
in
the
city
of
richmond.
it
is
set
forth
in
the
record,
it
contains
not
only
the
ward
plan
but
the
machinery
for
almost
immediate
election
as
the
city
of
richmond
feels
as
sooner
we
get
back
to
ballot
box
control,
the
better
everyone
is
in
their
city.
now,
first
of
all
let
me
say
with
respect
to
a
question
that
was
asked
about
since
1948
in
black
participation
in
the
city
council.
mr.
mattox
has
shown
me
a
piece
of
paper,
which
is
really
set
forth
in
the
record
pages
112
to
132
which
shows
this:
"since
1948
under
the
election
at
large
system,
the
citizens
of
richmond
have
elected
five
--
have
elected
four,
yes
it
is,
to
the
council
and
one
has
been
appointed.
at
one
time,
there
were
as
many
as
three
black
citizens
on
the
city
council."
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
on
the
nine-member.
so,
i
believe
the
record
with
respect
to
richmond
while
we
talk
a
lot
about
black
voting
and
polarization
and
everything,
these
blacks
could
not
be
elected
without
white
votes
because
as
mr.
wallace
has
pointed
out,
they
have
never
constituted
more
than
44%
of
the
voting
population
and
the
record
also
shows
of
course
that
the
whites
are
generally
much
larger
in
their
percentage
of
voting
than
the
black
citizens.
so,
the
city
of
richmond,
number
one,
because
this
matter
has
been
here
four
times
already
and
this
is
the
fourth
time
would
like
to
get
back
to
handling
its
own
affairs
and
get
out
of
court.
now,
with
reference
to
this
particular
nine-ward
plan.
what
happened
as
the
record
shows
is
that
after
petersburg
at
large
election
must
be
replaced
by
a
ward
plan
in
order
to
eliminate
the
discriminatory
effect
there,
the
city
of
richmond
and
conceded
on
the
record
below
that
principle
govern
richmond
and
began
working
very
intensively
to
try
to
come
up
with
a
plan
that
would
satisfy
that
standard
that
would
not
abridge
or
deny
the
right
to
vote
on
account
of
race
or
color.
and
so
back
and
forth,
back
and
forth
plans
went
with
the
department
of
justice
trying
to
achieve
a
plan
that
would
meet
with
their
approval
as
having
eliminated
all
possible
discriminatory
effect
of
the
annexation
and
finally
that
was
achieved.
and
i
must
tell
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
thought
that
when
that
was
achieved
the
case
was
over
because
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
statute
it
says
you
can
either
go
to
the
attorney
general
and
if
he
interposes
no
objection,
if
he
approves
in
other
words
or
you
can
go
to
a
three-judge
court.
now,
the
city
was
in
the
three-judge
court
and
the
department
of
justice
took
the
position
but
since
they
were
there
that
the
matter
should
be
presented
to
the
three
judges.
the
special
voting
rights
court,
but
that
it
should
be
presented
as
a
consent
judgment,
well,
because
it
would
also
have
this
election
machinery
and
it
too
that
was
one
other
part
of
their
presentation.
well,
i
presented
that
to
the
city
and
they
agreed
to
it.
their
great
desire
is
to
get
on
with
elections
in
richmond
and
get
this
all
behind
them.
now,
the
plan
as
presented,
the
nine-ward
plan
really
allows
the
black
citizen
of
richmond
fair
representation
in
the
overall
of
the
political
processes
of
the
city
prior
to
the
annexation.
they
couldn't
elect
anyone
under
this
plan
assuming
black
voting
polarization
which
i
don't
like
to
assume.
this
is
kind
of
repugnant
to
a
lot
of
ideals
and
a
lot
of
people
but
they
--
assuming
that
the
blacks
are
assured
of
four
seats
on
the
city
council.
now,
as
mr.
holt
says
in
his
brief
on
page
16
four
seats
on
the
council
is
really
fiscal
control
of
the
city
because
you
can't
adopt
a
budget
without
six
votes.
so,
i
think
that
this
is
an
enormously
meaningful
fair
solution
to
this
whole
problem.
the
case
when
it
came
on
below
as
we
say
in
our
reply
brief,
we
quote
the
order,
the
three
judges
said
that
the
issue
was
the
annexation
in
richmond
as
amended
by
this
ward
plan.
and
then
they
--
after
there
was
some
discussion
about
offering
evidence
on
the
original
annexation,
the
master
went
back
to
the
three
judges
and
they
said
well
you
can
let
in
evidence
on
the
original
annexation.
but
to
me
completely
throughout
these
whole
proceedings,
i
thought
when
the
attorney
general
who
has
made
a
statutory
expert
under
this
act
and
nearly
all
of
this
plans
are
passed
on
him.
they
don't
go
to
court
that
when
he
put
his
staff
of
approval
on
this
the
case
really
should
have
been
over.
now,
time
and
time
again
this
court
has
said
that
you
give
special
deference
to
the
views
of
someone
who
is
charged
with
the
administration
of
a
statute
and
we
put
all
of
those
in
our
brief.
and
so
here,
i
earnestly
believe
that
the
attorney
general's
views
below
were
entitled
to
more
weight
and
more
deference
than
they
were
given.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
your
honor,
i
made
that
argument
that
is
part
of
justices
i
didn't
quite
get
them
to
agree
with
me.i
think
it
is
a
good
argument
because
you
can
see
that
while
there
are
37%
of
the
voting
populations
under
the
new
city,
they
are
given
four
seats
and
a
chance
of
another
one
in
the
swing
ward
that
is
gradually
turning
but
from
white
to
black.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
right.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
that
is
right,
that
is
absolutely
right.
now,
one
of
the
things
about
the
decision
below
is
that
they
stated
rather
peculiar
and
unusual
burdens
of
proof
after
the
case
was
all
over
with.
they
said
that
because
the
city
was
smeared
with
a
discriminatory
tint,
it
was
up
to
the
city
and
there
was
extra
burden
cast
up
on
the
city
to
purge
itself
by
not
only
proving
lack
of
delusion
but
by
proving
some
legitimate
purpose
for
the
annexation.
well,
this
annexation
started
actually
in
the
1950's
and
all
through
the
1960's
there
was
either
litigation
or
something
going
on
in
connection
with
it
and
the
record
before
the
annexation
of
court
and
they
have
a
special
annexation
of
court
that
hears
this.
there
were
82
witnesses,
9,000
pages
of
testimony,
182
exhibits
overwhelming
as
to
the
purpose
under
virginia
law
of
the
annexation.
they
just
overwhelm
the
court.
the
record
is
completely
in
one
side
of
there
as
to
the
necessity
and
expediency
of
this
annexation
and
so
the
annexation
question
as
such;
we
don't
believe
the
economics
of
all
of
that
was
before
the
three
judges.
that
would
take
two
or
three
months
to
try
and
as
mr.
holt
says
in
his
brief,
i
don't
want
to
go
all
through
that.
we
stipulated
in
the
entire
record
in
annexation
case
and
so
far
as
economics
is
concerned,
there
is
no
question
but
what
the
city
proved
all
of
those
things
but
we
earnestly
suggest
to
this
court
that
voting
rights
act
is
concerned
with
voting.
i
have
read
that
from
beginning
to
end
a
good
many
times
it
talks
about
voters,
eligible
voters
and
registers
of
voters
and
all
that
kind
of
thing.
but
it
never
talks
about
any
economics
as
wiping
out
the
registered
voters
rights,
to
me
that
act
commands
a
quality,
quality.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
suppose
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
that
is
one
way
that
it
could
be
read
but
my
point
there
is
if
they
were
consider
economics
why
didn't
they
look
at
all
the
economics
that
are
in
the
record
in
the
annexation
court
which
was
stipulated
in,
they
didn't
do
that.
so,
i
think
that
in
so
far
as
economics
wiping
a
constitutional
right,
it
just
can't
be
and
we're
not
here
urging
that.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
it
was,
yes
it
was
because
immediately
after
the
attorney
general
agreed
to
it
and
then
when
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
pardon?
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
not
at
all.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
not
all.
they
seem
to
give
no
weight
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
i
think
the
timing
of
it
was
that
the
consent
degree
came
before
the
master
was
appointed
and
it
was
before
him,
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
attached
to
the
consent
judgment,
yes,
yes
it
is.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
he
did
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
it.
he
didn't
mention
it
so
and
neither
did
the
court.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
yes,
and
so
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes,
it
is.
yes,
it
is
but
there
is
no
reference
to
or
deference
to
the
fact
that
this
was
cleared
with
the
department
of
justice
as
completely
removing
the
discriminatory
effect
of
the
annexation.
now,
i
think
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
reply.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
an
error
on
page
57
of
our
brief
that
i
would
like
to
correct
first
of
all.
we
refer
there
in
the
last
paragraph
to
the
median
family
income
of
$12,400.00
in
the
annex
area.
the
$7,692.00
median
income
in
the
remaining
part
of
the
city
and
then
on
down
four
lines
from
the
bottom,
we
say
those
median
family
income
$20,000.00
it
should
be
under
$4,000.00
which
is
the
poverty
level.
now,
i
would
also
because
my
distinguished
colleague
mr.
wallace
has
called
my
attention
to
it
several
times
to
point
out
that
the
government
does
not
take
the
position
here
that
there
isn't
evident
and
overwhelming
evidence
to
support
the
fact
that
city
does
have
an
objectively
verifiable
legitimate
reason
for
retaining
the
next
area
and
they
say
that
in
their
brief
on
pages
30
to
35
so
that
they
agreed
that
the
evidence
is
there.
the
only
reason
they
made
reference
to
the
possible
remand
was
just
to
lean
over
backwards
in
case
someone
might
come
up
with
something
else
but
they
feel
that
the
best
solution
of
this
is
to
get
on
with
the
election.
now,
on
purpose,
i
think
we
ought
to
be
fair
about
it.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
an
election
under
the
nine
ward
plan
which
we
feel
is
the
only
fair
election
where
the
black
citizen
of
richmond
will
have
full
representation
and
participation
in
the
political
process
because
they
are
there
guaranteed
four
seats.
now,
with
reference
to
the
deannexation,
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
venable,
i
would
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
crusade
in
their
representations
to
the
three-judge
court
below
and
we've
quoted
this
on
pages
two
and
three
of
our
brief.
opposed
deannexation
said
that
this
would
be
--
leave
the
city
an
empty
shell,
a
worn
out
shell
and
it
wouldn't
have
the
room
or
financial
resources
to
provide
a
good
life
worth
citizens.
it
would
also
instantly
transform
the
schools
from
a
black
majority
system
to
a
virtual
black
system.
so,
i
would
say
very
earnestly
that
deannexation
other
than
mr.
venable
everybody
agrees
is
a
bad
remedy
and
we
sincerely
urge
that
on
purpose
that
mayor
bagley
(ph)
was
the
only
one
who's
quoted
throughout.
mayor
bagley
(ph)
has
been
off
the
city
council
and
not
as
mayor
since
1970
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
ward
plan.
there
are
only
two
people
left
on
the
council
who
were
on
there
at
the
time
of
this
bad
purpose
settlement
and
that
these
people
have
worked
awful
hard
to
bring
this
about.
they're
not
bigots
or
racist
in
richmond,
virginia,
i
think
this
is
shown
to
the
fact
that
the
white
people
have
elected
so
many
blacks
to
the
council
and
they
have
an
enormous
number
of
blacks
who
take
part
in
their
city
government.
i
think
there
are
how
many
departments
are
headed
by
blacks,
seminary,
seven.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
city
and
so
i
think
that
if
you're
going
to
talk
about
purpose,
let's
be
fair
about
it.
one
man's
terrible
words
in
a
bathroom
down
at
williamsburg
shouldn't
smear
the
good
people
of
an
entire
city.
and
who's
going
to
pay
the
penalty
for
the
bad
purpose,
it
shouldn't
really
come
down
that
way.
the
government
is
obviously
satisfied
that
there
is
no
bad
purpose
here.
they
never
would
have
signed
this
--
agreed
to
this
ward
plan
and
this
solution.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
and
we
urge
that
it
is
your
honor
that
evidence
is
overwhelmingly
against
that
finding.
the
mere
fact
that
the
attorney
general
agreed
to
it
at
some
evidence
and
the
other
evidence
on
the
ward
plan
is
such
as
only
this
so
called
expert
burden
and
the
economic
thing
where
they
say
we
didn't
satisfy,
they
never
have
told
us
this
what
their
extra
burden
was.
so,
we
met
our
burden
overwhelmingly
when
we
--
with
the
attorney
general
presented
this
nine
ward
plan.
so,
i
--
and
i
think
that
all
the
evidence
there
was
in
support
of
this
plan
and
proved
that
the
city
nail
in
connection
with
this
plan
doesn't
have
a
bad
purpose
and
certainly
the
ward
plan
doesn't
have
a
bad
effect.
it
gives
everybody
a
fair
participation
in
the
government
of
the
city
of
richmond
and
so
again,
we
urge
that
this
court
find
that
the
consent
judgment
is
the
best
possible
solution.
not
a
perfect,
there's
no
perfect
solution.
but
it's
the
best
possible
solution
and
let
the
people
of
richmond
get
on
with
this.
they've
been
litigating
and
litigating
and
litigating
this
reference
to
the
fifteenth
amendment.
well,
that's
been
all
the
way
up
here
and
the
fourth
circuit
held
no
fifteenth
amendment
rights
were
violated
by
this
annexation.
we
just
go
over
and
over
and
over
again.
so
we
urge
you
to
end
it.
it
can
be
ended,
they
can
have
an
election
within
60
days
and
richmond
can
govern
its
own
affairs
and
get
out
of
the
court.
that's
what
we
urge
to
this
court
to
do.
