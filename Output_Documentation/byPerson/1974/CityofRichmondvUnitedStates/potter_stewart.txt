may
i
ask
mr.
wallace
how
long
the
at
large
system
had
been
in
effect,
since
about
1950?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
considered
--
i'm
sure
quite
a
reform
in
the
structure
of
the
municipal
government
when
it
came
along
is
a
generally
political
scientist
think
that
to
be
an
enlightened
form
of
government,
a
small
council
elected
at
large
and
with
the
city
manager
system?
justice

stewart
and
that
came
in
at

how
large
a
council,
how
many
members?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
from
the
beginning,
so
this
involves
no
change
in
the
number
of
members
of
the
council?
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
simply
it
changes
from
--
ultimately
from
at
large
election
to
an
order
or
district
election.

justice

what
had
been
the
history
--
what
had
been
the
history
between
1948
and
1969
from
the
point
of
view
racial
identity
of
the
membership
of
the
council,
had
it
been
all
white
always?
justice

has
it
been
a
non-partisan
kind
of
ballot?
justice

no

on

--

that

justice

and
has
it
been
any
kind
of

voting
such
as
proportional

justice

does
the

the

justice

and
the

--
justice

it
has
alleged
on
this
--
on
the
ballot
with
no

designations
and
he
puts
up
to

no

they

justice
potter
stewart
we
have
another
case
suggested
by
my
brother
white's
question,
let's
assume
a
city
with
a
55%
majority
of
negroes
of
voting
age
who
in
fact
didn't
exercise
their
potential
and
therefore
the
majority
of
the
council
in
fact
historically
has
been
non-negro
and
then
you
annex
property
and
that
reduces
that
majority
from
55
to
51
and
you
continue
the
at
large,
now
would
that
be
a
violation
of
anything?
you
don't
make
any
changes,
it
has
been
at
large
before
and
it
is
at
large
now
and
there
is
still
a
majority
of
negroes
of
voting
age.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
has
been
a
slight
reduction
in
the
majority?
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
abstract?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we
haven't
read
the
facts
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
council
and
what
is
the
term
under
law
by
him,
two-year
term?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
election
is
odd
numbered
years
or
even
numbers?
justice
potter
stewart
the
gubernatorial
are
odd
numbered
years
in
virginia
and
the
--
and
as
far
as
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
school
or
is
the
school
district
coterminous
with
municipal
boundaries?
justice
potter
stewart
precisely.
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
the
facts
say
they
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
regardless
of
the
merits,
once
the
attorney
general
approve
it
even
though
he
was
late
in
doing
so,
if
you
think
in
not
preempt
terms
that
defeated
any
course
jurisdiction
because
how
did
you
approved
it
before
the
lawsuit,
there
could
have
would
have
been
no
lawsuit.
justice

justice

not
in
a
certain
context
under
the
fifteenth
amendment
a
white
citizen
could
have
standing.
justice
potter
stewart
his
claims
were
that
in
a
majority
where
there
were
black
majority
in
the
particular
governmental
unit,
there
was
discrimination
against
white

get
on

everybody
say
that
you
agree
about
that
but
in
his
way
but
mr.
venable
just
--
so
this
one,
he
was
talking
about
that.
he
was
talking
about
getting
onward
on
election
and
confining
the
electorate
to
the
old
city.
now,
what
sort
of
getting
on
with
what
kind
of
election
are
you
talking
about?
