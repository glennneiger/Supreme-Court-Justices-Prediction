mr.
--
mr.
wallace,
are
you
and
mr.
rhyne
dividing
as
between
issues?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i've
got
a
question
that
somewhere
along
the
line,
since
the
attorney
general
now
apparently
has
approved
the
richmond
plan,
why
isn't
this
moot
so
far
as
in
section
1973
(c)
is
concerned
under
the
voting
rights
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
intervenors
normally
mean
maintain
a
live
lawsuit
when
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
have
compromised
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
by
its
terms
does
require
the
state
of
political
subdivision
to
get
it
--
a
declaratory
judgment
to
the
effect
that
the
procedure
does
not
have
the
purpose
and
will
not
have
the
effect.
really,
it
is
phrased
so
that
they
have
to
carry
the
burden
i
would
think
on
both?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
court
below
look
in
to
economics
with
the
thought
of
looking
at
the
purpose
of
the
annexation
that
if
it
wasn't
justified
by
economics
means
that
would
at
least
supported
inference
that
it
was
justified
by
prohibited
motives?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
your
position,
mr.
derfner
that
if
the
purpose
is
bad,
you
don't
have
to
get
to
the
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly,
the
statutory
language
gives
no
intimation
of
that
sort
of
a
legislative
purpose
that
consent
of
the
attorney
general
is
valid
only
in
the
case
of
some
things
that
are
covered
by
the
declaratory
judgment
portion
of
the
statute
but
not
all
of
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
if
the
attorney
general
is
given
a
formal
submission
and
approves
it
under
the
language
of
the
statute
then
there
is
no
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
district
of
columbia,
is
that
--
you
agree
with
that
don't
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
other
than
the
ordinary
case
--
where
would
you
find
jurisdiction
for
that
sort
of
an
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
talking
about
a
case
where
a
jurisdiction
is
never
the
attorney
general
has
approved
and
then
an
action
is
sought
to
be
brought
by
someone
else
presumably
since
neither
the
city
has
to
bring
it
and
the
attorney
general
chooses
not
to
bring
it.
under
this
three-judge
district
of
columbia
declaratory
judgment
statute,
who
could
bring
that
sort
of
an
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
voter
even
if
the
attorney
general
had
approved,
would
still
under
the
last
sense
have
an
action
i
take
it
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
isn't
one
of
the
legitimate
problems
of
many
large
cities
of
problem
of
white
flight
and
don't
you
--
is
it
totally
ruled
out
under
this
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
take
that
into
consideration
and
trying
to
get
more
white
people
into
a
metropolitan
area
where
that
thing
is
rapidly
tipping.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wasn't
all
that
clear
that
it
was
about
annexations
at
the
time
this
annexation
took
place,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
very
debatable
question
whether
it
--
to
my
mind
whether
you
know
you
had
to
reach
the
results
you
did
in
allen
and
in
perkins
and
i
think
a
fair
minded
lawyer
could
conclude
that
an
annexation
was
not
within
the
statutory
language.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can't
enlarge
the
relief
granted
you
by
the
district
court
and
i
believe
under
our
rules?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
have
to
persuade
us
that
the
district
court
is
finding
against
during
that
point
is
clearly
erroneous?
