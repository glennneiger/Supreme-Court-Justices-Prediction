mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
here
today
for
the
national
association
of
recycling
industries,
your
honors.
this
industry
represents
the
trade
association
represents
all
of
the
processors,
collectors,
and
manufacturers
who
utilize
waste
paper,
textile
waste
and
nonferrous
metal
scraps
such
as
copper
lead,
aluminum
and
so
forth
in
manufacturing
processes.
in
area
of
course,
it's
been
a
party
to
the
281
proceedings
before
the
commission
and
intervened
in
the
case
before
the
district
court
and
has
participated
in
all
those
proceedings
since
i
think
before
this
case
was
last
before
this
court.
i
want
to
say
from
the
very
outset,
your
honor
that
--
your
honors
that
this
case
clearly
does
not
involved
any
complicated
abstract
environmental
issues
such
as
mr.
randolph
seem
to
try
to
indicate
to
this
court
today.
indeed,
i
think
that
his
description
of
the
situation
is
pretty
much
the
same
type
of
approach
the
commission
has
taken.
they
really
simply
can't
see
the
forest
for
the
trees
and
they
haven't
tried
to
see
the
forest.
they've
been
climbing
over
tree
after
tree.
there
are
three
statutes
that
this
court
really
has
to
look
at
when
you
approach
this
case
to
understand
what
congress
has
been
trying
to
get
this
commission
to
do.
first,
is
nepa
itself.
nepa
says
that
the
very
opening
section
4331
(b)
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
federal
government
to
use
all
practicable
means
consistent
with
other
essential
considerations
that
national
policy
to
enhance
the
quality
of
renewable
resources
and
approach
the
maximum
attainable
recycling
of
depletable
resources,
that's
statute
number
one.
statute
number
two,
is
the
resource
recovery
act
of
1970
wherein
congress
directed
the
government
to
study
the
transportation
rate
situation
and
the
picture
covering
recyclable
commodities
and
to
correct
it
where
a
discriminated
against
recyclables.
and
then
just
recently,
when
congress
had
before
the
railroad
reorganization
act
of
1973
which
was
dealing
with
the
failing
railroads
in
the
east.
it
again
included
a
section
603
which
directly
pointed
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
directed
the
commission
to
adopt
the
appropriate
rules
to
eliminate
discrimination
against
the
shipment
of
recyclable
materials
in
rate
structures
where
such
discrimination
exists.
so,
we
start
this
case
with
an
understanding
that
the
commission
has
been
clearly
directed
by
congress
and
this
court
has
a
legal
basis
to
proceed
from
not
a
complicated
abstract
environmental
basis.
you
have
a
legal
basis
to
proceed
from
to
understand
that
the
commission
is
simply
is
not
been
doing
its
job
in
its
area
and
that's
what
this
is
all
about.
now,
the
history
in
this
case
is
that
right
on
through
the
rendition
of
its
final
order
in
ex
parte
281,
the
commission
plainly
refused
to
file
any
impact
statement
whatsoever.
any
impact
statement
that
could
be
called
an
impact
statement
and
they
approved
the
increase
on
recyclable
commodities
without
filing
anything
under
nepa.
it
was
only
when
an
injunction
was
there
and
then
threatened
because
they
would've
been
clearly
beyond
the
appeal
of
the
law
that
they
then
reopened
the
case.
at
that
point
and
five
months
later
after
they
had
approved
the
rates
on
recyclables
already,
they
issued
a
draft
statement.
and
seven
months
later,
without
holding
any
hearing
whatever,
they
issued
the
final
statement
which
is
of
course
before
the
court
today.
now,
your
honors
to
understand
the
real
essence
of
this
case,
i
ask
you
please
to
look
at
pages
6
to
7
of
our
main
brief
before
this
court
which
is
the
green
original
brief.
it
sets
forth
what
the
real
rate
picture
is
and
what
congress
has
been
trying
to
get
that
with
this
commission
and
what
this
commission
has
been
refusing
to
do.
in
1959,
the
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
mr.
chief
justice,
i
understand
i
have
one
short
minute
left.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
i
was
directing
the
court's
attention
to
pages
6
and
7
of
nari's
main
brief
in
this
case
and
with
a
limited
time,
i
have
left
i
can
only
ask
your
honors
to
look
at
those
rates
which
are
taken
from
the
commission's
file
so
as
the
net
average
rate
for
the
transportation
of
competing
recyclable
waste
paper
and
wood
pulp
and
competing
metal
scrap
and
ores
to
show
how
the
annual
rate
increases
by
their
percentage
application
alone
continue
to
excess
of
a
discrimination
in
those
rates
year
by
year
by
year.
also,
i
just
want
to
briefly
say
your
honor
that
when
mr.
randolph,
the
solicitor
general
said
that
section
under
that
there
are
really
a
big
in
rates
involved
in
this
ex
parte
proceedings
i
would
ask
your
honors
to
look
at
point
3
of
our
supplemental
brief
and
understand
that
that
makes
a
section
13
complaint
procedure
absolutely
no
remedy
whatever.
because
that
means
that
the
shapeup
in
a
case
of
this
kind
must
challenge
rate
after
rate
after
rate
and
we
estimate
on
the
basis
of
the
railroad's
own
figures
that
it
would
take
a
thousand
to
3000
case
years
to
challenge
just
the
rates
in
the
eastern
district
alone,
that's
in
our
supplemental
brief.
in
his
closing,
the
solicitor
general
stated
when
congress
passed
nepa
it
intended
to
say
while
this
court
what
impact
will
an
increase
have,
not
did
it
have
an
impact.
in
this
case,
we
say
that
this
is
the
--
none
of
this
case
that
the
impact
statement
was
not
made
until
after
the
commission
had
approved
the
increase
and
then
for
the
first
time
look
at
the
impact.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
no,
your
honor.
we
say
not
because
under
157,
the
statutory
scheme
is
that
they
filed
a
rate
then
it's
subject
to
commission
approval.
and
in
answer
to
what
mr.
horsky
said
in
his
argument,
the
commission
passes
not
only
on
the
commission
passes
in
a
157
proceeding
on
the
lawfulness
of
the
rate
and
that's
what's
involved
here.
we
say
these
rates
are
unlawful
because
of
the
violation
of
nepa.
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
well,
--
mr.
edward
l.
merrigan
nepa
readdress
to
the
federal
agency
the
commission
your
honor
and
the
commission
has
its
statutory
duty
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
of
course
under
nepa
too
to
perform
its
function
under
nepa
in
this
action.
and
i
don't
understand
the
government
to
argue
either
the
government
or
the
railroads
to
argue
that
the
commission
does
not
have
the
duty
to
prepare
an
impact
statement.
that
seems
to
be
out
of
the
question
anymore
that
they
would
argue
that.
they
do
have
the
obligation
under
nepa
and
since
this
is
a
proceeding
under
the
section
157
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
this
is
a
major
federal
action
which
has
to
be
supported
by
a
nepa
statement
because
of
the
government's
involvement.
thank
you,
your
honor.
