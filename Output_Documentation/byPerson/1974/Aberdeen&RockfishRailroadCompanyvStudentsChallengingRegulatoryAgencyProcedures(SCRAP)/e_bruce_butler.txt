mr.
e.
bruce
butler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
summarize
for
the
court
what
we
just
feel
to
be
the
basic
inadequacies
with
the
statement.
these
are
essentially
that
the
commission
failed
to
come
to
grips
with
central
issues
post
by
other
federal
agencies.
mr.
e.
bruce
butler
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
--
the
lower
court
has
an
obligation
to
look
first
at
whether
there
has
been
procedural
compliance
with
these
specific
statutory
requirements
of
nepa
namely
whether
the
commission
in
this
case
has
filed
an
impact
statement
discussing
the
points
outline
in
the
statute.
mr.
e.
bruce
butler
well,
i
think
that
that's
the
real
question
here
what
--
where
does
procedure
end
and
substance
begin.
and
we
would
suggest
that
certainly
at
the
bottom
and
the
underlying
rate
action
is
clearly
a
substantive
matter.
the
conclusion
of
the
commission
as
to
whether
its
--
and
is
there
an
environmental
impact.
that
we
would
also
suggest
is
a
conclusion
but
those
we
would
also
agree
that
should
be
tested
by
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
the
question,
did
the
commission
come
to
grips
with
central
issues?
we
believe
its
procedural
matter
and
therefore
tested
under
the
rule
of
reason
as
we've
suggest
in
our
brief.
and
looking
at
that
in
that
matter,
we
feel
that
the
lower
court
was
entirely
correct
in
concluding
that
the
commission
did
not
come
to
grips
with
the
central
issues.
ceq
--
mr.
e.
bruce
butler
well,
--
mr.
e.
bruce
butler
the
format
clearly.
mr.
e.
bruce
butler
obviously
the
second
but
that
is
not
we're
here
arguing.
we're
suggesting
that
ceq
and
epa
made
numerous
comments
to
the
federal
agencies
suggesting
that
various
matters
to
be
considered.
what's
the
impact
on
long-term
investment?
what
is
the
impact
of
the
underlying
rate
structure
and
some
of
these
issues
such
as
the
underlying
rate
structure
clearly
the
commission
offers
a
conclusion
they
offers
no
supporting
data.
and
other
issues
it's
simply
does
not
address
the
subject
matter.
and
as
evidence
for
this
we
would
cite
the
comments
of
these
five
agencies.
i
don't
think
it
serves
any
purpose
to
try
and
read
these
to
you
now,
they're
in
the
record
they
have
been
excerpt
by
each
of
us
but
as
we
suggested
earlier
the
comments
are
scathing
and
that
they
continue
until
today.
mr.
e.
bruce
butler
no,
i
think
and
this
is
not
something
that's
in
after
the
fact
suggestion
by
these
various
agencies.
these
are
comments
that
were
made
very
early
in
the
proceeding
by
not
only
the
agencies
by
the
parties
as
well.
mr.
e.
bruce
butler
it
is
a
rule
of
reason,
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
--
you
had
to
look
at
in
its
totality.
how
many
various
comments
were
--
mr.
e.
bruce
butler
that
is
clear,
yes.
even
though
you're
convinced
that
the
agency
knew
about
it
and
rejected
and
had
to
reject
in
order
to
--
mr.
e.
bruce
butler
i
think
the
purpose
of
nepa
is
that
in
the
environmental
impact
statement,
the
commission
is
to
set
forth
what
his
reasoning
is
so
that
not
only
the
courts
can
judge
of
what
the
issues
are
but
nepa
is
also
for
the
benefit
of
congress
and
the
president.
so,
they
can
judge
what
the
basic
environmental
issues
are
and
take
future
action
to
depending
on
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court
for
its
indulgence.
