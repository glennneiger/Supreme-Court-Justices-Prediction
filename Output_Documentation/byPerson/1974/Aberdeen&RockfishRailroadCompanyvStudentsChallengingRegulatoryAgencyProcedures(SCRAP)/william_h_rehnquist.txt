rehnquist
mr.
horsky,
are
you
going
to
cover
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
as
well
as
of
the
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
is
basically
the
revisers
didn't
intend
any
change
and
then
i
take
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
one
wanted
to
challenge
the
commission's
determination
that
the
railroads
in
fact
needed
more
revenue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
that
wouldn't
be
an
occasion
for
reviewing
a
general
rate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
the
arrow
depended
on
a
particular
provision
of
statutory
law,
didn't
it?
this
is
the
general
rate
order's
kind
of
a
judicially
carved
out.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
at
page
13
you
said
of
the
brown
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
assumption
is
that
the
existing
rate
structure
is
satisfactory
and
the
only
question
is
whether
you
want
--
need
to
increase
it
across
the
board?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
case
identical
to
this
had
been
here
in
1947
would
you
say
we
had
no
jurisdiction
over
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
a
statute
that's
been
dead
for
27
years,
are
you
arguing
then
that
the
revisers
in
1948
intended
to
change?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
you
argue
that
the
revisers
did
intend
to
change?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
one
thing
i
think
for
this
court
to
say
something
like
that
but
i
think
quite
another
to
say
that
congress
when
it
adopted
a
revision
of
the
entire
judicial
code
and
to
one
section
was
put
on
somewhat
different
form
intended
the
substantive
change.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hellegers.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
just
was
reading
over
this
united
states
against
griffin
that
you
cited
to
the
court
and
that
seems
to
go
to
a
limited
construction
of
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
rather
than
to
a
limited
construction
of
this
court's
jurisdiction.
i
would
think
that
would
tend
to
support
the
proposition
that
perhaps
the
district
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
or
nothing.
we
don't
have
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
then
it's
quite
conceivable
that
even
though
congress
wanted
a
case
a
case
to
be
heard
by
three
judges
rather
than
one
in
the
district
court,
it
might
not
have
wanted
it
appealed
directly
to
this
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
a
moment
mr.
merrigan.
does
it
make
any
difference
in
the
applicability
of
nepa
to
this
case
that
the
rates
are
set
by
the
carriers
rather
than
by
the
commission?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
there's,
assume
there've
been
no
violation
of
nepa
by
the
railroads
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
because
they're
not
subject
to
it.
