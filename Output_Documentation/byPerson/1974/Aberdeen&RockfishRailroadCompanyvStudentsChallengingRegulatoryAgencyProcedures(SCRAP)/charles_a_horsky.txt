mr.
charles
a.
horsky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this,
i
think
is
the
third
time
this
proceeding
has
been
before
this
court.
i
hope
i
can
persuade
you
that
it
should
be
the
last.
the
present
posture
of
it
involves
basically
two
questions,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
lower
court
to
enter
an
order
and
on
the
merits
whether
the
order
was
correct.
because
it
has
been
the
position
of
the
intervening
railroads
whom
i
represent
that
the
lower
court
lack
jurisdiction
and
we
have
urged
that.
i'm
speaking
first
and
i
will
try
and
confine
myself
to
the
jurisdictional
issue.
mr.
randolph
will
deal
with
the
merits
should
the
court
reach
them.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
had
hoped
that
i
could
rely
on
our
briefs
for
that
but
i'll
be
glad
to
comment
on
it
if
you
like.
let
me
put
this
case
in
context.
the
proceeding
--
this
proceeding
began
in
1972
and
the
course
of
events
that
the
court
and
at
the
commission
since
that
time
is
set
out
in
our
briefs
in
detail.
i
think
i
can
make
the
present
posture
of
it
clear
in
a
very
few
words.
at
the
1972
term,
this
court
dealt
with
the
problem
of
a
temporary
emergency
surcharge
which
had
been
proposed
by
the
railroads
in
early
1972.
as
the
court
is
aware
as
the
chief
justice
indicated
in
the
preceding
argument
in
the
railroad
industry
tear
of
changes
are
made
by
the
railroads
and
subject
only
to
a
power
in
the
commission
to
suspend
for
a
period
of
seven
months.
the
rates
proposed
by
the
railroads
go
into
effect
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
they
remain
in
effect
unless
and
until
the
commission
itself
finds
them
unlawful.
in
1972
when
the
commission
declined
to
suspend
the
temporary
emergency
surcharge
of
this
district
court,
the
same
district
court
we
have
now,
enjoined
the
commission
to
do
so.
this
court
reversed
that
decision
on
the
ground
of
arrow
transportation
company
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
suspension
orders.
in
the
meantime,
the
railroads
had
replaced
the
2.5%
temporary
emergency
surcharge
with
a
general
4%
rate
increase
which
became
generally
effective
in
october
of
1972.
with
one
exception
as
applied
to
recyclables,
the
commission
did
suspend
the
increase
until
june
1973
while
it
undertook
a
rather
elaborate
effort
to
further
explore
the
environmental
problems.
shortly
before
1970's,
june
1973
when
that
4%
increase
was
to
take
effect
on
recyclables,
the
respondents
here
sought
an
injunction
and
the
district
court
again
enjoined
the
rates.
again,
this
court
reversed.
while
that
appeal
by
our
side
from
that
injunction
was
pending,
the
appellees,
the
respondents
here
sought
declaratory
judgment
in
the
lower
court.
they
sought
two
things.
they
sought
first,
a
declaration
that
the
environmental
impact
statement
prepared
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
inadequate.
and
that
therefore,
its
order
allowing
the
rate
increase
is
to
go
into
effect
was
invalid
and
that
the
commission
should
be
directed
to
prepare
a
new
environmental
impact
statement.
and
second,
that
the
rate
should
be
enjoined.
a
divided
district
court
this
time
for
the
first
time
concluded
that
it
had
jurisdiction
to
review
the
general
revenue
orders
by
reason
of
a
supposed
nepa
exception
national
environmental
protection
act.
it's
too
hard
to
say,
that's
nepa
if
i
may
and
that
on
the
merits,
the
environmental
impact
statement
as
applied
to
recyclables
was
inadequate
and
must
be
read
on
by
the
commission.
it
declined
however
to
enjoined
the
collection
of
the
rates
and
they
are
now
being
collected.
now,
that's
the
posture
of
the
case
as
it
now
before
you.
the
respondents
do
urge
mr.
justice
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
in
this
court
on
two
grounds
that
the
order
of
the
commission
was
phrased
in
terms
of
setting
aside
rather
than
in
enjoining
the
commission,
and
that
the
case
may
be
moot.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
the
order
of
the
court
below.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i'm
sorry,
the
order
of
the
court
below.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
setting
aside
rather
than
enjoining.
we
dealt
with
that
mr.
justice
in
our
reply
brief
in
some
length
both
the
government
and
ourselves
and
in
interest
of
time.
i
don't
think
the
arguments
are
meritorious
and
i
would
prefer
not
to
take
my
time
on
them
but
i
will
if
you
like.
i'd
like
to
deal
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
which
is
terribly
important
and
i'd
like
to
persuade
you
if
i
can
that
the
dissenting
judge
below
reached
the
correct
result
when
he
said
that
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
thought
they
were
not
meritorious.
the
arguments
says
that
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
review
this
appeal.
i
don't
believe
they
are
very
substantial.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
quickly.
it's
clear
under
the
urgent
deficiencies
back
in
1913
that
it
would
be
jurisdictional.
the
revisers
note
say,
they
didn't
intend
any
change
in
the
electronic
industries
case.
the
same
point
was
briefed
and
argued
to
this
court
and
the
court
would
have
had
decided
it
in
our
motion.
they
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
on
this
ground
and
you
did
not
reserve
a
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
merits.
i
think
there
is
not
very
much
reason
why
i
should
be
worried
about
those
arguments
at
this
point.
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
as
i
say
is
really
a
very
important
question
and
i
do
want
to
talk
about
that.
i
can
state
it
very
simply
for
about
40
years
since
a
decision
by
judge
chesnut
in
baltimore
and
the
algoma
case.
the
district
courts
--
the
federal
district
courts
had
declined
jurisdiction
when
asked
to
review
general
revenue
orders
of
the
commission.
that
is
orders
which
are
so-called
ex
parte
orders
in
which
the
railroads
proposed
a
general
across
the
board
rate
increase.
and
in
which
the
decision
of
the
commission
as
to
whether
or
not
to
suspend
the
order,
suspend
the
increases
for
the
seven
months
period
is
really
based
on
whether
or
not
the
railroads
need
additional
revenue.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
rates
are
just
unreasonable
in
such
cases
and
in
this
case.
the
commission
makes
very
clear
that
the
rates
which
have
been
increased
by
the
general
revenue
order
can
be
challenged
in
a
subsequent
proceeding
before
the
commission
under
section
13
or
section
15
by
any
party
on
any
ground
that
will
ordinarily
be
available.
and
in
the
algoma
case
as
judge
chesnut
pointed
out,
the
consequences
that
challenging
them
in
the
general
revenue
proceeding
is
premature
and
that
the
people
are
properly
remitted
to
the
procedure
where
the
rates
that
actual
legality
of
the
rates
can
properly
be
test.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that
would
be
open
if
the
commission
had
relied
on
it
in
its
determination.
in
other
words,
you
file
a
section
13
proceeding.
i
mean
a
section
13
complaint
against
the
recyclable
rates.
the
commission
has
a
hearing.
it's
mandated
to
have
an
investigation.
it's
not
optional,
it
must
do
it
and
it
must
come
out
with
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
rates
are
just
and
reasonable.
if
the
commission's
decision
is
bottomed
on
the
needs
of
the
railroad,
that
is
reviewable
by
the
courts
just
like
anything
else.
if
the
commission
does
not
rely
on
that,
if
that
isn't
an
issue
as
to
justness
and
reasonableness
then
it
need
not
be
reviewed
because
it
isn't
relevant
anymore.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
i
should
think
no.
no,
that's
not
any
reason
why
you
need
to
review
a
general
revenue
order
because
if
it
becomes
a
matter
of
issue
in
a
particular
case
where
the
real
issue
is
presented
that
is,
is
this
a
lawful
rate
to
the
extent
that
the
needs
of
the
revenue
--
needs
of
the
railroads
for
revenues
enter
into
that
determination?
it
is
reviewable
just
like
any
other
consideration
which
enters
into
it.
the
algoma
rule
really
is
very
similar
to
the
more
familiar
role
in
the
arrow
transportation
case
which
this
court
accepted
and
applied
in
the
previous
decision
in
this
case
in
that
earlier
scrap
case.
that
decision
was
as
i
say
that
the
arrow
decision
that
courts
will
not
review
suspension
orders
of
the
commission.
because
the
icc
has
no
general
power
to
get
to
give
prior
approval
to
rates,
these
ex
parte
proceedings,
these
general
revenue
proceedings
are
handled
essentially
the
same
way
as
to
the
suspension
power.
general
revenue
orders
don't
determine
whether
the
rate
is
just
and
reasonable.
they
leave
that
as
does
as
a
suspension
order
to
a
further
administrative
remedy.
now,
in
this
case,
judge
wright
writing
for
himself
and
judge
richey
concluded
not
to
follow
the
algoma
rule.
he
had
in
fact,
in
1970
dissented
from
its
application
in
a
case
that
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment
that
reached
this
court
from
the
district
of
columbia.
but
in
this
case,
he
did
not
dissent
from
the
algoma
rule;
he
found
what
he
instead
was
a
nepa
exemption
to
it.
that
is
that
under,
if
the
challenges
under
environmental
protection
act,
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
notwithstanding
the
algoma
rule.
we
believe
that
that
is
directly
in
the
teeth
of
the
prior
decision
of
this
court
in
the
earlier
case
--
earlier
hearing
in
this
case.
let
me
remember
--
let
me
refresh
your
recollection.
in
that
case,
the
lower
court
the
same
district
judge
concluded
that
although
under
the
arrow
transportation
company
rule,
district
courts
did
not
have
the
power
to
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
the
commission's
suspension
order.
nonetheless,
because
this
was
a
nepa
case,
they
could
go
ahead
and
do
it.
this
court
reversed
and
it
said
in
its
opinion
that
nepa
did
not
contemplate
any
wholesale
overruling
of
prior
law.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
i
think
that's
a
distinction
really
that's
--
i
don't
think
that's
quite
true
your
honor.
you
did
refer
to
section
157
into
the
history
but
i
believe
that
the
analysis
in
aero
and
the
analysis
in
the
algoma
case
are
practically
the
same.
they
go
back
to
the
statute.
they
look
at
the
statute?
what
does
the
statute
contemplate?
you
have
a
very
nicely
balanced
system
created
after
a
great
deal
of
experimentation
by
congress
using
railroad
initiative
to
create
the
rates,
a
certain
amount
of
commission
power
to
suspend
them
for
a
while
and
an
adequate
remedy
with
reparation
if
necessary
for
anyone
who
is
injured
by
this
process.
and
the
district
court
decision
in
algoma
just
like
the
arrow
transportation
decision
and
the
previous
decision
in
scrap
are
all
part
of
that
statutory
system
which
has
been
worked
out
over
the
year.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
1935
has
been
followed
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
--
followed
consistently.
there
have
been
no
dissents
from
it.
i
come
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that's
right.
(voice
overlap)
let
me
come
to
that
because
the
algoma
rule
was
before
this
court
in
the
1969
term
in
three
cases.
in
each
case,
the
lower
court
had
applied
it
with
only
one
judge,
judge
wright
dissenting
out
of
the
nine
lower
court
judges.
and
two
of
those
case,
the
alabama
power
case
and
the
atlantic
city
electric
company
case.
this
court
divided
evenly
and
the
cases
were
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
in
the
third
of
those
cases,
the
electronic
industries
case,
the
decision
of
this
court
was
unanimous
and
affirmed
unanimously.
i
come
back
in
a
moment
to
the
--
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
all
summary
actions.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
all
three
of
the
1969
term.
i'll
come
back
to
the
atlantic
city
and
alabama
power
in
a
moment.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
that
was
an
affirmance.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
yes,
some
unanimous
affirmance.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
let
me
talk
about
the
electronic
industries
case
because
i
think
you
don't
need
to
reach
really
the
algoma
rule
in
this
case
because
i
think
the
electronic
industries
case
applies
here.
in
the
other
two
cases
in
atlantic
city
and
alabama
power,
the
challenge
was
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested
to
the
whether
the
commission
was
right
in
its
determination
that
revenue
needs
warranted
the
increase.
that
cut
across
all
the
rates.
in
electronic
industries,
the
challenge
was
to
particular
rates
on
television
sets,
radio
sets,
components
of
those
sets
just
as
here
the
challenge
is
to
recyclable
commodities.
and
we
submit
that
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
in
electronic
industries
means
that
certainly
you
will
not
permit
a
challenge
to
particular
commodities
in
a
general
revenue
order
proceeding
which
is
what
this
case
is.
the
government,
i'm
happy
to
say,
agrees
partially
with
that
but
not
wholly
with
it.
they
agreed
that
the
electronic
industries
case
means
what
i
have
just
said
it
means.
but
they
don't
agree
that
this
is
such
a
case.
they
say
and
i'm
quoting
from
their
brief
that
“the
respondents
broadly
attacked
to
the
commission's
general
revenue
order.”
i
don't
think
that's
correct.
in
fact,
i
think
that
did
wrong.
the
general
revenue
order
here
decided
essentially
that
the
railroads
need
for
revenue
permitted
the
commission
to
terminate
the
suspension
which
has
originally
ordered
prior
to
the
exploration
of
the
suspension
date.
that
determination
isn't
challenged
by
the
respondent.
they
zero
in
on
a
few
specific
rates
on
a
dozen
or
so
recyclable
commodities.
they
say
that
those
are
the
ones
that
are
bad
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
just
like
electronic
industries
and
if
as
i
suggest
electronic
industries
means
that
you
can't
take
particular
rates
and
challenge
them
in
a
general
revenue
proceeding.
i
think
that
would
dispose
of
this
case
but
if
the
court
were
to
agree
with
the
government
that
this
is
not
an
electronic
industries
if
you're
back
to
algoma
and
the
problem
that
divided
the
court
in
1969.
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
or
two
to
urge
as
strongly
as
i
can
that
you
do
affirm
the
algoma
doctrine.
the
basic
point
in
that
doctrine
is
that
nobody
is
entitled
to
a
rate
which
is
less
than
just
and
reasonable
and
that
there
can
be
no
resolution
of
that
question,
no
divinity
of
resolution
of
what
that
question
--
the
answer
to
that
question
except
in
the
section
13
or
section
15
proceeding.
you
can't
settle
it
in
the
general
revenue
proceeding.
in
the
section
13
proceeding,
the
commission
can
and
it
does
take
into
account
all
factors
that
go
into
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate
including
of
course
environmental
factors
allowing
a
review
of
it
in
a
general
revenue
order
is
really
no
different
than
reviewing
a
suspension
order
and
it
really
is
no
different
in
reviewing
any
kind
of
an
interlocutory
order
before
there
has
really
been
a
decision.
but
it's
more
than
that,
this
would
certainly
encourage
objections
to
all
general
revenue
orders
under
our
new
legislation
effective
this
year,
those
objections
are
now
going
up
to
district
court
but
the
court
of
appeals
but
i
would
venture
to
say
we
have
an
appeal
and
each
of
the
eleventh
circuit
courts
from
every
general
revenue
order
by
somebody.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
no,
any
new
--
i'm
thinking
of
the
future.
mr.
charles
a.
horsky
well,
if
a
new
order
comes
out,
if
the
railroads
asked
for
a
new
general
rate
increase,
we're
going
to
have
objections,
we're
going
to
have
injunctions
the
possibility
of
discriminatory
decision
--
different
decisions
and
different
circuits.
and
any
decision
that
they
make
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
previous
reversal
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
would
have
an
impact
--
the
premature
impact
on
the
administrative
procedure
that
violate
what
you
had
said
should
not
be
done
in
the
wichita
green
case.
moreover,
it
seems
to
me
that
because
one
would
expect
these
attacks
and
one
would
expect
as
we
have
had
in
this
case
injunctions
after
injunctions
which
have
to
be
appealed
to
be
reversed.
the
effect
on
the
railroad's
revenues
were
these
orders
are
based
on
revenue
needs
would
be
substantial.
the
railroads
are
in
need
of
revenue.
i
don't
mean
that's
the
reason
why
the
court
should
have
jurisdiction.
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
is
a
fact
to
be
taken
under
consideration
in
by
this
court
in
determining
whether
a
rule
which
has
been
in
effect
for
40
years
which
is
part
of
the
framework
of
this
nicely
balanced
system
which
is
worked
out
as
i
say
in
the
statute
between
the
rights
of
the
railroads
to
propose
rates,
the
rights
of
the
commission
to
suspend
them,
the
rights
of
the
shippers
and
others
to
protest
them,
to
be
protected
and
get
rebates
or
reimbursement
if
the
rates
are
wrong.
whether
any
change
in
a
40-year-old
system
should
be
made
by
this
court
or
if
it
is
to
be
changed
at
all
should
not
be
made
by
congress.
thank
you.
