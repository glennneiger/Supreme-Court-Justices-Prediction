mr.
john
f.
hellegers
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
a
case
of
which
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction.
the
case
is
here
on
direct
appeals
under
28
u.s.
code,
section
1253
from
the
grant
of
a
13-month-old
declaratory
judgment
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
obliged
to
prepare
an
adequate
environmental
impact
statement
in
ex
parte
281,
this
general
revenue
proceeding
and
that
it
did
not
in
fact
do
so.
now,
if
i
had
to
depend
for
my
information
on
this
case
on
the
jurisdictional
statements
and
the
briefs
of
the
appellants,
i
would've
thought
that
this
declaration
had
deprived
the
appellant
railroads
of
millions
of
dollars
in
loss
revenues
and
paralyze
the
commission's
ability
to
conduct
general
revenue
proceedings
and
that
this
was
why
the
judgment
was
appealed.
but
on
closer
examination
that
turns
out
that
this
simply
isn't
so.
it
was
left
to
us
to
bring
the
attention
of
the
court
that
the
icc
has
issued
the
whole
serious
of
general
revenue
orders
in
the
last
13
months.
probably,
more
solved
in
that
in
any
other
year
and
recent
history;
this
includes
one
that
was
served
just
yesterday
which
we've
lodged
to
the
court.
and
also
something
that
i
would
never
have
guessed
from
reading
the
appellant's
papers
was
that
if
we
take
the
rates
the
actual
rail
rates
that
are
allowed
by
the
commission
in
effect
just
prior
to
ex
parte
281
which
is
this
proceeding
is
being
100
then
it
turns
out
that
now
the
rates
on
primary
commodities
to
find
as
all
those
that
are
not
recyclables
would
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
140
and
those
on
recyclables
would
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
120.
now,
i
submit
that
the
judgment
from
which
these
appeals
were
taken
is
certainly
not
an
injunction
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
nobody
claims
that
it
is
rather
the
claim
is
that
there
is
unwritten
exception
to
section
1253
which
authorizes
direct
appeals
to
this
court
not
only
to
the
grant
--
from
the
grant
to
denial
of
an
injunction
which
is
what
1253
requires
but
also
from
certain
non-injunctions.
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
appellants
do
not
rely
on
any
currently
effective
statutory
language
for
that
proposition.
what
they
rely
on
is
ghost
language
which
was
deleted
from
the
traditional
code
27
years
ago
in
1948.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
i
was
just
about
to
answer
your
honor's
question.
the
answer
to
that
is
that
if
this
case
had
come
up
under
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
on
the
surface
of
it,
it
might
appear
that
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
would
confer
jurisdiction.
but
i
think
that
there
is
some
considerable
doubt
about
that
on
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
allowed
appeals
not
only
from
the
grant
or
denial
of
an
injunction
but
also
from
the
final
hearing
in
any
case
that
was
brought
to
suspend
or
set
aside
an
icc
order.
now,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
very
particularly
in
that
context
to
a
case
that
was
cited
to
us
by
the
railroads
and
which
i
regret
that
we
did
not
pick
up
in
our
briefs
but
i
certainly
would
if
the
brief
were
being
written
today.
that
is
the
case
of
united
states
versus
griffin
which
is
in
303
u.s.
226.
and
in
griffin,
the
supreme
court
in
the
unanimous
opinion
or
unanimous
judgment
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
construed
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
and
held
that
it's
grant
of
extraordinary
jurisdiction,
three-judge
courts
and
direct
appeals
to
the
supreme
court
was
not
to
be
read
even
as
broadly
as
its
literal
language
on
the
result
of
that
would
be
to
authorize
jurisdiction
which
had
no
substantial
policy
justification.
specifically
in
griffin,
the
issue
was
that
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
on
its
phase
authorized
three-judge
court
jurisdiction
in
any
suit
brought
to
suspend
and
set
aside
and
join
or
no
any
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
the
court
held
that
the
words
“any
order”
do
not
mean
literally
any
order
because
there
are
some
orders
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
said
mr.
justice
brandeis
are
manifestly
not
of
such
public
importance
as
to
require
this
jurisdiction
in
the
extraordinary
procedure
of
a
three-judge
court
and
direct
appeals
to
the
supreme
court.
so,
on
the
construction
that
they
quote
on
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
in
griffin,
i
would
say
that
it's
doubtful
whether
even
had
that
statute
been
in
effect
whether
a
case
is
highly
unusual
as
this
would
want
direct
review
by
the
supreme
court
and
a
fortiori
there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
which
requires
the
or
certainly
on
the
current
statutes
which
requires
the
court
to
give
literal
construction
to
a
statute
which
has
been
dead
for
27
years
in
order
to
authorize
an
appeal
here
which
has
no
substantial
policy
justification.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
well,
i'm
arguing
certainly
that
they
took
out
the
language
on
which
the
appellants
relied
for
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
well,
i'm
arguing
your
honor
that
jurisdiction
in
this
court
it
seems
to
me
is
a
matter
that's
governed
by
statutes
and
it's
governed
by
currently
existing
statutes
and
the
rule
for
many
years
has
been
one
of
strict
construction
of
jurisdictional
statutes.
and
the
--
i
think
a
paraphrase
of
that
rule
is
that
if
congress
wants
to
confer
extraordinary
jurisdiction
on
this
court
for
direct
appeal
but
it
has
to
do
so
specifically
in
terms
and
in
literal
statutory
language.
and
just
last
december,
the
court
had
a
case,
the
gonzales
case
in
which
it
was
held
that
the
1253
which
is
the
statute
under
which
this
purportedly
comes
up
is
not
to
be
given
its
--
the
full
breadth
that
its
literal
language
might
imply
if
this
leads
to
undesirable
results.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
well,
the
case
on
this
that
cited
to
us
your
honor
is
the
ryder
case
which
goes
back
to
1884
and
the
proposition
which
--
for
which
ryder
has
cited
is
that
in
this
kind
of
revision
that
congress
has
not
intended
to
make
changes.
but
i
have
looked
into
this,
i've
jeopardize
ryder,
read
the
succeeding
cases
and
i
have
never
found
the
case
and
none
has
been
cited
to
us
by
the
appellants
in
which
the
ryder
rule
was
used
to
create
direct
appeal
jurisdiction
in
this
court
for
that
was
interrogation
of
the
then
currently
existing
statutory
language.
so,
--
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
i
think
that
as
your
honor
read
that
order
it's
in
two
parts.
one,
purports
to
vacate
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
orders
in
ex
parte
281
and
the
other,
remands
the
case
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
further
proceedings
in
accordance
with
the
opinion.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
all
right,
fine.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
those
parts
one
by
one.
and
on
the
first
part,
the
words
“vacate
and
void”
which
the
court
also
used
sound
certainly
as
they
ought
to
mean
something,
but
when
we
look
more
closely
at
this
we
find
that
they
mean
almost
nothing
even
potentially.
perhaps,
literally
nothing.
we
assumed
in
writing
the
brief
that
the
lower
court
was
cracked
in
its
characterization
of
the
effect
of
vacating
the
commission's
orders
when
it
said
that
the
only
effect
of
vacating
the
commission's
orders
is
that
the
railroads
may
not
rely
in
certain
hypothetical
subsequent
proceedings
on
a
commission
finding
that
the
proposed
rates
in
281
were
just
unreasonable.
and
we
took
that
at
face
value.
the
appellants
said
nothing
which
intended
to
suggest
that
that
was
wrong.
i
have
since
been
persuaded
that
the
lower
courts
vacating
“of
the
commerce
commission's
orders”
doesn't
even
have
that
effect.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
specifically
declined
to
make
any
finding
that
these
rates
were
just
and
reasonable.
and
there
is
also
some
ambiguity
in
the
government's
brief
which
we
picked
up
in
ours
about
whether
the
vacating
of
the
commission's
orders
is
going
to
have
an
effect
on
the
burden
of
proof
in
hypothetical
subsequent
reparation
proceeding
should
any
occur.
and
the
way
that
we
picked
it
up
from
the
government's
brief
was
that
the
vacating
of
the
commission's
orders
would
have
the
effect
of
shifting
the
burden
of
proof.
i've
since
been
persuaded
that
that's
not
correct
either
that
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
13
(1)
proceeding
is
always
on
the
complainant
and
that
nothing
that
happens
by
way
of
voiding
or
vacating
the
general
revenue
order.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
well,
i
think
for
that,
we
would
rely
on
the
taylor
versus
board
of
education
case,
judge
friendly's
opinion
in
that
in
which
he
said
that
not
every
order
that
has
words
of
command
is
an
injunction;
just
as
not
every
order
that
has
words
of
prohibition
is
an
injunction
on
that
side
either.
but
certainly
what
the
court
did,
did
not
meet
the
requirements
let's
say
of
rule
65
for
an
injunction
as
to
form,
it
was
not
couched
in
language
of
injunction
and
indeed
none
of
the
appellants
here
--
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
pardon
me?
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
well,
injunction
under
1253
is
the
word
to
be
construed
very
narrowly
as
your
honor
will
recall
from
cases
like
mitchell
versus
donovan
and
gunn
versus
university
committee
to
end
the
war.
the
word
“injunction”
as
it
appears
in
1253
has
always
been
subject
for
this
canon
of
very
narrow
construction.
it
is
not
a
casual
term
which
encompasses
everything
that
doesn't
fit
neatly
into
some
other
category.
so,
our
contention
on
that
is
that
this
order
comes
in
two
distinct
parts
and
neither
one
of
them
satisfy
the
test
for
an
injunction.
so,
the
question
is
why
are
we
here
and
why
does
this
court
have
jurisdiction.
now,
in
talking
about
united
states
versus
griffin
again,
i
brought
out
the
point
that
the
test
there
was
whether
the
order
which
was
sought
to
be
brought
here
was
of
the
kind
of
public
importance
that
would
warrant
that.
here,
of
course
the
order
is
13
months
old,
it
has
never
had
any
practical
effect
in
the
railroads
so
far
as
i
can
determine
on
any
rate
charge.
it
is
had
no
practical
effect
whatever
in
impeding
the
commission
in
approving
subsequent
general
revenue
orders
and
indeed
they
have
more
on
these
13
months
and
i
think
they
have
many
other
13-month
period
in
recent
history.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
i'm
sure
it
does
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
reason
why
that
they've
had
these.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
i
did
not
intend
to
express
surprise
that
they
had
these.
my
point
was
that
the,
that
nothing
in
the
lower
court's
opinion
has
had
any
practical
effect
on
impeding
one.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
uh-huh!
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
well,
i
would
treat
wichita
along
with
all
--
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
yes,
sir.
i
would
treat
wichita
along
with
all
of
the
other
cases
which
the
appellants
cite
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
practical
distinction
between
enjoining
and
setting
aside
an
icc
order
and
that
that
distinction
has
been
blurred
in
previous
cases.
and
i
think
the
reason
that
that
has
been
blurred
is
that
in
those
cases
there
was
no
practical
distinction
in
all
of
these
in
putting
wichita
so
far
as
i
can
recall.
there
were
some
direct
immediate
practical
effect
from
the
lower
court's
order.
somebody
either
could
do
something,
it
could
not
do
something,
or
he
was
enjoined
to
do
something
or
--
but
it
had
an
effect
on
what
people
could
do
on
the
real
word.
and
here,
we
don't,
we've
had
13
months
and
it's
had
no
effect.
now,
i'd
like
to
pass
very
briefly
to
the
issue
of
the
lower
court's
jurisdiction.
and
on
that
i'd
like
to
leave
my
argument
principally
to
the
briefs
and
specifically
that
some
briefs
that
were
not
in
this
case
but
to
the
government
briefs
in
the
alabama
power
and
atlantic
city
cases
that
were
before
this
court
five
years
ago
in
which
the
commission
took
a
long
hard
look
as
they
say
at
the
jurisdictional
issue
of
the
lower
court
and
came
out
to
a
conclusion
that
is
squarely
in
favor
of
us.
and
the
government
has
reaffirmed
that
conclusion
here
saying
that
the
alabama
power
and
atlantic
city
argument
that
it
made
is
very
applicable
in
this
case.
the
only
thing
that
i'd
like
to
say
on
that
issue
in
addition
to
that
is
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
heart
of
horsky's
argument
is
that
this
suit
is
really
just
a
backdoor
effort
to
get
rate
reparations
without
going
through
the
administrative
procedure
that
is
set
up
for
rate
preparations
a
13
(1)
proceeding.
that,
i
would
submit
is
simply
incorrect.
nobody
in
this
case
has
asserted
that
he
has
any
absolute
right
not
to
pay
the
rates
as
raised.
what
the
argument
is
that
if
the
commission
wants
to
raise
these
rates
and
we
concede
that
its
discretion
to
do
so
that
the
commission
has
to
comply
with
its
statutory
procedural
mandates
and
we
claim
that
that
is
not
the
case
here.
and
that
therefore,
we
are
entitled
to
have
judicial
review
of
our
claim
that
it's
not.
and
i
would
submit
that
that
puts
the
case
on
all
force
to
deal
with
the
heart
case
that
was
here
four
years
ago
for
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
did
not
assert
any
absolute
right
not
to
have
a
highway
built
through
their
park.
they
simply
claimed
that
if
the
secretary
of
transportation
was
going
to
approve
such
a
highway
he
had
to
follow
the
proper
procedures
and
the
court
of
course
held
that
they
were
entitled
to
judicial
review
of
their
claim
that
that
did
not
happen
there.
now,
i'd
like
to
move
finally
to
the
merits.
the
central
contention
it
seems
to
me
on
the
merits
is
that
it's
beyond
the
power
of
the
lower
court
or
of
any
court
to
tell
the
interstate
commerce
commission
that
it
is
prepared
and
inadequate
environmental
impact
statement
in
this
general
revenue
proceeding.
and
that
that
is
so
even
when
the
clear
consensus
of
comments
from
sister
agencies
with
environmental
expertise
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
specifically
required
by
statute
to
consult
and
attain
the
comments
from
in
preparing
its
environmental
impact
statement.
from
the
consensus
of
these
other
agencies
is
this
is
a
sadly
deficient
statement.
in
fact,
i
think
we
can
fairly
and
conservatively
characterize
those
comments
as
being
scathing.
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
particular
attention
to
something
that
was
filed
yesterday
by
mr.
merrigan
which
i
just
saw
yesterday
new
one
for
the
first
time.
this
is
mr.
merrigan's
supplemental
brief
for
appellees,
national
association
of
recycling
industries
et
al.
unfortunately,
it's
in
the
same
shade
of
green
or
almost
as
our
brief
in
chief
but
at
appendix
d
which
is
pages
9
(a)
through
18
(a),
we
have
correspondents
from
the
--
between
the
united
states
environmental
protection
agency
and
mr.
merrigan
--
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
it's
in
the
1
your
honor
label
supplemental
brief
and
it
would
be
at

(a)
and
following
pages
appendix
d.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
that's
right.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
on
page
9
(a),
we
have
a
letter
to
mr.
merrigan
from
a
deputy
assistant
administrator
for
solid
waste
management
programs
and
epa.
and
then
we
have
some
correspondence
between
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
the
office
of
the
solicitor
general
in
which
epa
requested
permission
to
file
a
brief
in
this
case
and
the
letter
in
which
they
requested
leave
to
file
--
that
was
a
fairly
good
(inaudible),
i
would
imagine
of
what
they
intended
to
file.
and
when
i
say
scathing
comments
i
refer
for
example
to
what's
at
the
top
of
page
12
(a)
where
the
environmental
protection
agency
actually
calls
into
question
whether
the
looked
at
the
commission
talked
at
environmental
effects
in
this
case
was
made
in
good
faith.
they
actually
used
those
words
which
are
words
to
go
beyond
anything
that
we've
said
or
felt
that
we
had
to
say.
there
are
many
other
comments
that
were
made
by
other
environmental
expert
agencies
and
i
emphasize
again
that
the
commission
was
required
to
solicit
their
opinions
in
this
case
and
consult
with
them.
they
are
extensively
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
well,
i
just
got
that
this
morning
too.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
it
refers
to
this
and
as
i
recall
that
the
substance
of
that
letter
is
directed
to
mr.
merrigan's
allegation
that
ceq,
the
counsel
on
environmental
quality
also
sought
leave
to
file
a
similar
brief
and
was
--
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
well,
i'm
arguing
only
from
what
i
see
in
print
before
me.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
that
what?
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
well,
i
have
no
knowledge
of
whether
to
see
if
he
has
try
to
file
a
brief
or
not
and
he
goes
a
little
further
and
says
there
were
time
problems
which
is
why
this
wasn't
permitted
to
be
put
before
the
court
by
the
epa
itself
that
comes
through
mr.
merrigan.
now,
these
comments
here
that
i'm
directing
the
court's
attention
to
right
now
come
from
the
environmental
protection
agency
which
put
through
its
office
of
solid
waste
management
is
also
very
actively
and
expertly
involved
in
questions
of
recycling
of
commodities
and
the
effect
of
rail
rates
there.
now,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
something
else
that
was
just
lodged
yesterday
because
we
got
it
only
yesterday.
this
is
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
order
in
ex
parte
number
310.
the
service
date
is
march
25,
1975
which
is
yesterday.
and
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
particular
attention
to
page
39.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
it
looks
like
this.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
it
came
in
yesterday,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
page
39
of
that.
and
there
the
interstate
commerce
commission
makes
the
statement
that
it
remains
a
basic
economic
fact.
this
is
so
maybe
10
or
15
lines
down
in
the
second
paragraph
right
after
footnote
4.
it
remains
a
basic
economic
fact
that
not
granting
a
proposed
rate
increase
for
recyclables
would
generate
a
degree
of
positive
environmental
benefit.
and
then
if
you
read
down
to
footnote
5,
you
find
that
their
expert
authority
for
the
effect
of
rate
increases
on
the
environment
as
the
united
states
environmental
protection
agency
1974.
now,
also
this
proposition
that
it
lies
beyond
the
court's
power
to
tell
the
commission
that
its
impact
statement
is
inadequate
would
require
the
court
in
this
case
to
disregard
the
history
of
the
case
which
is
the
history
of
the
icc
using
the
word
“insignificant”
like
a
rubber
stamp
to
characterize
the
environmental
impact
of
raising
freight
rates.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
prior
history
prior
to
this
impact
statement
is
that
the
icc
had
never
prepared
an
impact
statement
on
any
rate
regulation
activity
of
its
and
its
device
for
avoiding
this
was
that
it
made
a
boilerplate
finding
in
each
of
a
great
number
of
cases
that
the
proposed
action
would
have
no
environmental
impact.
and
the
lower
court
found
that
this
was
qualified
boilerplate,
a
mere
stratagem
and
words
to
that
effect
and
that
of
course
is
not
challenged
in
this
court.
but
the
point
of
this
is
that
the
icc
kept
using
this
word
“insignificant.”
so,
we
come
to
the
present
impact
statement
and
lo
and
behold
we
find
our
very
prolix
document.
and
after
each
section,
the
icc
tells
us
that
the
environmental
impact
of
what
it
proposes
to
do
will
be
“insignificant”
there
is
that
word
again.
and
it
doesn't
give
any
figures
to
tell
what
it
means
by
“insignificant.”
now,
there's
been
some
criticism
of
our
use
of
the
impact
statement
and
ex
parte
295
but
in
ex
parte
295,
the
icc
finally
got
a
round
to
saying
what
it
meant
by
“insignificant”
and
it
turns
out
that
what
they
mean
by
insignificant
is
that
a
3%
rate
increase
on
metal
scrap
alone
not
counting
any
other
kind
will
have
the
effect
of
requiring
increase
consumption
of
electric
power
sufficient
to
supply
a
residential
city
of
130,000
people
or
43,000
households
assuming
about
3
persons
to
a
household
according
to
the
current
census
data.
and
it
turns
out
that
the
fuel
cost
of
generating
that
electricity
alone
is
going
to
be
an
excess
of
$6
million
which
is
a
figure
that
no
one
has
contested
since
we've
used
it
in
our
briefs.
it
turns
out
that
the
capital
cost
of
creating
the
generating
capacity
for
that
is
an
excessive
$39
million.
now,
the
point
of
these
uncontested
figures
is
that
maybe
you
think
that
these
figures
are
insignificant
maybe
you
don't
but
it's
a
point
on
which
there
can
be
disagreement
and
there
is
nothing
and
i
emphasize
this,
there
is
nothing
in
the
historical
expertise
of
the
icc
which
automatically
validates
its
characterization
of
an
insult
to
the
environment
or
cost
as
being
insignificant.
so
we
have
to
know
what
they
mean
by
insignificant.
now,
it's
argued
that
the
295
and
following
impact
statements
merely
reaffirmed
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
findings
in
ex
parte
281
that
the
impacts
were
insignificant.
but
the
difference
is
that
we
knew
what
in
--
that
we
know
what
insignificant
means
now
and
we
didn't
know
them.
and
as
i
said,
you
can
defer
as
to
whether
that
word
ought
to
be
applied
and
other
agencies
have
deferred
on
the
last
page
of
the
ex
parte
295
impact
statement.
the
--
i'm
afraid
there's
only
one
copy,
i
think
with
the
court
but
the
department
of
interior
quite
gently
points
out
that
the
assumption
that
have
changed
of
less
than
1%
metals
consumption
is
insignificant
can
be
questioned.
i
think
that's
a
very
conservative
statement
and
epa
in
this
material
it's
filed
at
the
rear
of
mr.
merrigan's
brief
on
page
14
(a)
looks
at
those
figures
and
it
looks
at
the
conclusion
insignificant
and
it
says
that
the
--
that
in
ex
parte
295,
these
are
certain
scrap
commodities.
the
commission
has
reached
the
conclusions
contrary
to
those
but
its
cursory
analysis
in
ex
parte
281.
now,
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
point
to
something
that
has
greatly
struck
me
about
the
briefs
in
this
case
that
we've
gotten
from
appellants
and
that's
the
distance
traveled
in
those
briefs
between
the
jurisdictional
statements
in
the
original
briefs
and
the
reply
briefs.
i
thought
that
the
reason
of
this
case
was
brought
to
this
court
when
i
read
the
jurisdictional
statements
on
the
opening
briefs
was
that
the
lower
court's
judgment
was
going
to
require
things
that
were
literally
impossible.
now,
in
the
reply
brief,
we
find
that
well
they
are
arguing
that
not
only
of
these
things
not
impossible
but
the
deficiencies
have
been
cured
since
and
these
supposedly
impossible
things
have
been
done.
we
found
that
argued
in
the
opening
briefs
that
this
would
bring
general
revenue
proceedings
to
a
screeching
halt.
we
were
not
told
that
there
have
been
four
or
five
depending
on
how
you
count
since
that.
we
were
not
told
that
the
rates
are
going
up
by
40%
on
virgin
materials
and
20%
on
scrap.
thank
you.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
well,
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
part
of
its
doing
is
taking
jurisdictional
language
from
the
urgent
deficiencies
act
which
as
the
court
says,
it
creates
extraordinary
jurisdiction
and
the
words
“extraordinary
jurisdiction”
can
obviously
be
filed
as
well
at
this
court's
jurisdiction
perhaps
more
so
as
to
the
lower
courts.
and
it's
saying
that
when
that
language
literally
followed
or
blindly
followed
is
going
to
lead
to
a
result
which
has
no
policy
justification
then
it
will
not
be
followed.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
equally
as
applicable
to
the
question
of
direct
appeal
jurisdiction
in
this
court
which
has
always
been
most
narrowly
confined.
mr.
john
f.
hellegers
your
honor,
the
answer
of
that
is
that
this
case
was
brought
before
a
three-judge
court
because
we
asked
for
an
injunction.
we
asked
for
an
injunction
against
the
collection
of
certain
rates
pending
the
completion
of
an
adequate
environmental
impact
statement.
had
we
asked
only
for
the
relief
that
was
in
fact
granted?
i
would
submit
that
that
would've
been
proper
to
bring
before
a
single
judge
and
that
that
would've
gone
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i
would
call
your
honor's
attention
also
to
the
brashear
case
which
we
cite
in
which
it
has
held
obviously
that
not
everything
that
was
heard
before
a
three-judge
court
by
virtue
of
that
alone
qualifies
for
direct
appeal
in
this
court.
