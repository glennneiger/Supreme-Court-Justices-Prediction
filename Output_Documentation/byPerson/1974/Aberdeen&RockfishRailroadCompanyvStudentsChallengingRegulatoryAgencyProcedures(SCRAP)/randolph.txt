mr.
randolph
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
remaining
to
appellants,
i
would
like
to
devote
my
attention
to
the
merits
of
the
case
as
mr.
horsky
said
in
our
position
on
the
jurisdictional
issue
is
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
on
pages
2
to
4
.
the
icc
and
the
united
states
have
not
taken
any
position
against
or
argued
against
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
district
court
since
appellee
is
invoked
to
district
court's
jurisdiction.
i'm
sure
that
they
will
devote
substantial
attention
to
it.
the
issue
on
the
merits
in
this
case
is
whether
the
interstate
commerce
commission
adequately
complied
with
the
national
environmental
protection
act
(nepa)
as
it
did
the
icc
in
its
final
environmental
impact
statement
in
this
case
adequately
consider
the
environmental
impact
of
its
actions.
in
the
first
opinion
that
the
court
rendered
in
this
case
in
1973,
the
court
remarked
that
the
icc,
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
had
issued
a
report
in
october
of
1972,
which
rather
approximately
300
pages
in
length
and
gave
extensive
and
i
quote
the
court
“consideration
to
environmental
factors.”
the
commission
at
that
time
did
not
issue
an
environmental
impact
statement
as
nepa
requires
for
a
significant
federal
actions
effecting
the
environment
because
the
commission
believes
that
the
action
that
they
were
then
taking
which
was
allowing
a
rate
increasing
to
go
into
effect
would
not
affect
the
environment.
however,
as
mr.
horsky
has
described
when
the
commission's
report
was
issued,
there
were
number
of
protest,
number
of
critical
comments.
as
a
result,
the
commission
reopened
the
proceedings
in
regard
to
one
particular
class
of
items
recyclables
and
i
think
its
well
to
define
what
we
mean
by
recyclables
here.
it
sounds
like
a
one
small
group
of
class
of
commodities.
in
fact,
it's
a
huge
class
of
commodities.
on
page
13
of
the
appendix,
the
commission
drops
a
footnote
and
defines
what
is
meant
by
recyclables.
at
least
a
number
of
classifications
of
different
commodities,
i
emphasize
the
word
“classifications.”
in
other
words,
--
mr.
randolph
13
of
the
appendix.
it's
the
last
footnote
on
the
page.
there
are
--
they
may
be
confusing
because
in
the
upper
right
hand
corner
there
are
numbers
that
say,
91
and
this
was
a
federal
offset
and
i
think
that's
the
reason.
mr.
randolph
yes.
mr.
randolph
the
footnote
describes
in
that
and
defines
what
is
meant
by
recyclables
and
then
lists
for
a
number
and
by
description
of
various
classifications
of
commodities.
however,
it's
misleading
to
think
that
these
are
the
only
commodities
that
we're
only
talking
about
a
dozen
or
so
commodities
because
within
each
one
of
these
transportation
classifications
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
different
commodities
for
example
i
had
xeroxed
before
the
argument.
all
the
commodities
comprised
in
the
last
two
items
that
is
41
ashes
and
42
wastes
to
scrap
and
this
is
from
the
tariff
that's
issued
by
the
american
association
of
railroads
and
it
runs
on
page
after
page
after
page.
mr.
randolph
no,
they're
noils.
mr.
randolph
they
are
noils.
mr.
randolph
the
rovings
are
basically
--
mr.
randolph
collets
that's
a
glass
scrap
and
noils
are
glass
are
basically
fibers.
mr.
randolph
yes.
and
they
moved
on
the
nation's
railroads
everyday
mr.
justice.
and
they
all
have
different
tariff
rates
and
i
think
i
have
heard
estimated
and
i
don't
think
anyone
really
knows
how
many
different
rates
there
are
throughout
the
united
states.
someone
has
estimated
a
trillion.
i
think
a
billion
is
certainly
a
very
conservative
estimate
as
a
number
rates
and
all
one
has
to
do
is
think
of
the
fact
that
for
any
given
commodity
such
as
potatoes
moving
between
baltimore
and
washington
d.c.
you
have
one
rate
and
if
it
moves
between
washington
d.c.
and
some
other
cities.
so,
from
--
for
the
tens
of
thousands
of
commodities
are
moved
on
the
nation's
railroads
everyday
between
hundreds
of
thousands
of
points
of
origins
and
destinations,
you
have
different
rates.
we're
dealing
here
with
a
group
of
commodities
recyclables.
it
is
a
large
group
of
commodities
and
for
every
place,
destination,
origin
there
are
different
rates
that
are
applicable.
the
icc,
the
commission
in
trying
to
determine
what
environmental
impact
a
rate
increase
would
have
on
these
recyclable
commodities
took
a
very
general
view.
it
dealt
with
eight
specific
broad
classifications
of
commodities
and
it
dealt
in
general
terms
with
recyclables.
and
having
reopen
to
proceeding
to
deal
with
recyclables
and
having
issue
of
bibliography
that
is
distributed
to
all
interested
parties
of
500
different
sources
setting
forth
what
effect
could
be
expected
of
the
rate
increase
and
contacting
by
telephone,
by
mail
compiling,
analyzing
--
the
commission
finally
issued
a
200-page
draft
impact
statement
copy
of
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix.
after
the
commission
issued
that
draft
impact
statement,
they
received
comments
from
various
federal
agencies.
they
received
comments
in
the
parties
to
the
case.
to
give
the
court
an
idea
of
what
how
generally
general
revenue
proceeding
really
is.
just
consider
the
fact
that
469
attorneys
entered
appearances
in
this
proceeding,
469.
the
proceeding
is
very
general,
the
commission
asked
for
comments.
it
received
comments.
the
final
report
which
runs
nearly
200
pages
and
it's
printed
in
the
front
of
the
appendix.
for
example,
went
into
great
detail
about
the
general
classes
that
the
commission
decided
to
consider.
let
me
take
steel
for
example.
the
commission
has
a
section
--
scrap
steel.
what
effect
will
a
4.1%
or
6%
increase
on
the
transportation
rate
for
scrap
steel
have
on
the
environment?
consider
that,
the
commission
went
through
a
review
of
steel
making
industry
at
large
that
reviewed
steel
making
technology,
how
steel
is
made,
what
kind
of
furnaces
are
used.
it
took
a
look
at
the
steel
foundry
systems
throughout
the
united
states.
it
considered
the
scrap
industries
structure,
the
various
different
kinds
of
scrap
that
are
used
then
for
scrap
technology.
as
a
result
through
200
pages
of
very,
very
detailed
on
clamp
analysis,
the
commission
came
to
a
conclusion
and
the
conclusion
was
that
perhaps
this
whole
impact
statement
was
mistitled.
maybe
it
should've
been
called
an
environmental
non-impact
statement
because
the
commission's
conclusion
was
that
this
rate
increase
would
have
no
significant
effect
whatever
on
the
environment.
if
the
commission's
consideration
of
environmental
factors
on
october
1972
was
extensive
as
this
court
said.
by
the
spring
of
1973,
it
was
tenfold
more.
it
pervaded
this
entire
proceeding
since
this
impact
statement
was
issued.
there
have
been
five
more
general
revenue
proceedings.
they're
coming
now
at
the
rate
of
one
every
six
or
seven
months
as
the
railroad's
revenues
declined
as
cost
go
up
and
the
railroads
need
more
money.
the
environmental
impact
statement
issued
an
ex
parte
295
which
came
after
this
proceeding
was
filed
with
this
court
large
with
the
court.
also
an
environmental
impact
statement
was
issued
in
a
general
overall
investigation
of
the
underlying
rate
structure
of
the
railroads
in
this
country
ex
parte
270
that
was
large
in
this
court.
if
one
reads
the
brief
filed
by
scrap
in
this
case
and
particularly
the
factual
statement,
one
will
come
away
with
the
conclusion
on
particularly
on
pages
10
to
11
of
the
sort
of
green
color
brief
that
everything
the
commission
has
done
since
this
proceeding,
since
this
impact
statement
has
contradicted
itself.
although,
it
found
no
significant
environmental
impact
here
in
later
proceedings
through
using
more
sophisticated
analysis
and
greater
study
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
it
came
to
a
different
conclusion.
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
on
page
10
for
example
in
the
scrap
brief,
appellees
state
rather
than
having
no
significant
environmental
impact
is
claimed
in
the
commission's
previous
boilerplate
findings
referring
to
this
case
that
the
commission
found
in
ex
parte
295
that
the
following
would
occur
with
respect
to
nonferrous
metals
and
then
there's
a
quotation.
let
me
read
to
the
court
exactly
what
precedes
that
quotation.
the
commission
said
and
i
quote
--
mr.
randolph
page
--
at
the
bottom
of
page
10
to
11
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
randolph
the
commission
said,
and
i'll
read
right
up
to
the
beginning
of
that
quotation.
“however,
the
quantitative
effects
of
the
3%
rate
increase
will
be
very
small.”
in
all
case,
only
a
fraction
of
1%
of
the
presently
recyclable
volume
of
any
commodity
as
a
result
in
environmental
impacts
in
terms
of
the
increase
consumption
of
resources
including
energy
and
of
pollution
are
expected
to
be
insignificant.
and
now,
we
reach
the
quotation.
“specifically,
in
regard
to
nonferrous
metals,
the
decrease
in
scrap
consumption
is
expected
to
be
two
one-hundredths
of
1%
of
the
present
volume.
as
a
result
of
which
and
then
the
quotation
picks
up,
“an
estimated
3,000
tons
of
metal
will
be
annually
required.”
the
same
is
true
for
the
quotation
on
page
11
what
the
appellees
have
set
forth
as
seeming
to
be
a
great
environmental
impact.
actually,
according
to
this
commission's
later
environmental
impact
study
is
a
decrease
in
recycled
scrap
of
0.18
of
1%
as
a
result
of
the
3%
rate
increase.
and
i
might
add
too
--
sir?
mr.
randolph
i'm
reading
from
–
yes,
sir.
i'm
reading
from
a
final
environmental
impact
statement
is
a
later
general
revenue
proceeding.
this
has
been
filed
enlarged
with
the
court,
its
ex
parte
295.
and
i
might
say
also
that
this
minimum
impact
that
the
commission
found
which
confirms
everything
that
it
said
in
this
case
which
involved
ex
parte
281
is
on
a
worst
case
basis.
this
is
the
worst
that
could
be
expected
at
two
one-hundredths
effect.
the
district
court
held
here
that
the
commission
felt
to
give
adequate
consideration
to
the
environment
and
must
begin
this
proceeding
allover
again.
why?
because
the
commission
felt
that
issue
and
environmental
impact
statement
hardly
because
the
commission
did
not
comply
with
the
nepa's
five
requirements
of
what
the
commission
must
look
at.
no,
the
district
court
said
that
the
commission
did
comply
with
nepa
as
to
form.
because
the
icc's
consideration
of
environmental
impact
was
not
extensive
could
hardly
claim
that
because
the
commission's
conclusion
of
no
significant
effect
from
the
rate
increases
was
mistaken.
curiously,
there's
no
one
in
this
case
yet
it
says,
the
commission
was
wrong
back
in
1973
when
it
issued
this
impact
statement
that
that
4.1%
rate
increase
would
affect
the
environment.
nobody
said
that.
no.
what
the
district
court
held
is
that
the
commission
didn't
do
enough
that
it
should've
study
some
more
that
maybe
it
was
right
here,
maybe
it
was
wrong
but
it
had
to
“not
limit
its
analysis
as
it
did
here”
to
the
“marginal
impact
of
the
most
recent
rate
increase”
with
no
discussion
whatever
of
the
underlying
rate
structure
itself
as
that
is
significantly
effects
the
environment.
i
want
to
pause
at
this
point
and
point
out
to
the
court
that
everything
that
i
have
said
so
far
in
regard
to
analysis,
you'll
notice.
and
also
in
regard
to
what
the
district
court
held
has
very
little
to
do
directly
with
the
environment.
and
the
questions
that
i
have
talked
about
you
could
have
a
team
of
the
greatest
environmental
scientist
in
the
world
sitting
in
a
room
with
all
the
books.
they
could
never
solve
any
of
these
questions.
why
not?
because
what
we're
really
talking
about
here
is
economic
forecasting
not
and
only
derivatively
the
environment
that
is
if
recyclables
do
not
move
on
the
nation's
railroads,
then
as
a
result
more
virgin
ore
will
have
to
be
consumed
to
produce
the
final
end-product.
but
what
we're
engaged
in
here
and
what
the
commission
was
engaged
in
is
really
of
economic
forecasting.
this
is
not
a
case
for
example
like
where
the
question
was,
what
effect
will
thermal
pollution
have
on
the
flora
and
fauna
of
the
title
estuary?
that's
not
the
question
here.
the
question
here
is
what
effect
on
the
movement
of
the
goods
on
the
nation's
railways
will
a
3%
or
4%
rate
increase
have?
once
we
recognize
that,
you
must
recognize
as
well
that
any
investigation
into
that
kind
of
a
question
can
mushroom
into
its
open-ended.
it
can
mushroom
into
the
entire
american
economy.
let
me
give
you
an
example.
you
cannot
talk
or
begin
to
talk
about,
what
effect
the
rate
of
increases
on
the
movement
of
scrap
steel
will
happen
until
you
know
how
steel
is
currently
made?
you
have
to
know
what
the
structure
of
the
steel
industry
is.
you
have
to
know
ore
virgin
materials
and
short
supply,
could
scrap
steel
be
used
under
present
conditions.
how
scrap
steel
collected?
what
is
the
structure
of
the
scrap
steel
industry?
how
is
it
shipped?
you
couldn't
stop
there,
still
more.
what
is
the
demand
for
steel?
will
the
order
industry
increase
orders
for
steel
or
decrease?
what
is
the
construction
industry?
and
once
you
reach
that
point,
you
have
to
go
further.
what
is
the
public
demand?
will
people
buy,
what
will
the
state
of
the
economy
be?
and
so
on
until
you've
analyze
the
entire
american
economy
to
determine
what
effect
the
certain
rate
increase
will
have
in
the
movement
of
steel
scrap
throughout
the
nation's
railroads.
and
remember
we're
not
talking
about
just
one
commodity.
we're
talking
about
literally
under
these
classifications
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
commodities.
in
having
done
all
that,
if
it
takes
you
six
months
or
seven
months
or
a
year
or
two
years
are
so
on
and
so
forth.
by
the
time
the
ink
is
dry
and
the
things
is
printed
up,
it's
probably
out
of
date
because
there
has
been
a
tax
cut,
an
oil
crisis,
the
prime
interest
rates
have
changed.
the
district
court's
critic,
we
submit
of
the
commission's
environmental
impact
comes
down
to
simply
this
that
the
commission
could
have
done
more.
but
that
we
submit
is
a
standardless
inquiry.
we
submit
as
well
that
the
commission
could
always
do
more
when
it's
engaged
in
environmental
forecast
which
brings
us
to
what
we
think
is
the
basic
proposition
in
this
case.
while
we
believe
and
we
said
in
our
brief
that
every
agency
must
take
a
hard
look
at
the
environmental
consequences
of
what
it
proposes
to
do.
that
nevertheless,
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
function
performed
by
the
agency.
this
was
a
general
revenue
proceeding.
the
commission's
inquiry
was
very
general.
the
one
thing
that's
clear
under
section
157
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
is
that
congress
wanted
the
commission
to
answer
the
questions.
the
question,
do
the
railroads
need
increase
revenue?
not
to
say,
did
the
railroads
need
increase
revenue
way
back
when
which
is
what
the
commission
will
have
to
do
if
they're
ordered
back
to
reopen
this
proceeding.
and
we
submit
as
well
that
under
nepa
what
congress
wanted
an
agency
to
do
is
answer
the
question,
will
this
action
have
an
effect
on
the
environment.
not
answer
the
question,
did
that
action
have
an
effect
on
the
environment.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
it's
because
if
the
commission
does
not
act
within
seven
months
then
the
rates
go
into
effect
under
the
section
157
of
the
environmental
policy
or
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
let
me
emphasize
this
again,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
cannot
revise
the
entire
underlying
rate
structure
in
a
general
revenue
proceeding.
it
can
only
consider
the
question
whether
the
increase
and
rate
is
justified
by
the
railroad's
need.
we
submit
in
that
situation
the
only
thing
the
commission
has
to
analyze
is
whether
that
increase
in
rate
will
have
an
effect
and
adverse
effect
on
the
environment.
they
did
that
here.
mr.
randolph
in
the
general
revenue
proceeding,
that's
correct.
now,
the
commission
did
not
say
that,
“well,
we're
going
to
take
the
underlying
rate
structures
are
given
to
him,
we're
just
going
to
ignore
whether
that
has
an
environmental
effect.”
the
commission
said
that
we're
studying
that
in
ex
parte
270.
we've
hired
a
special
counsel.
we
have
these
proceedings
going
on
to
consider
the
entire
rate
structure
the
united
states
is
no
small
test.
this
is
only
second
time
in
the
commission's
history
that
has
hired
a
special
counsel
and
the
court
of
course
knows
who
the
first
one
was,
mr.
justice
brandeis.
but
i
just
want
to
say
one
more
thing
about
the
--
this
question
of
looking
into
the
underlying
rate
structure.
the
district
court
relied
upon
comments
from
other
agencies
and
you
have
to
read
the
district
court's
opinion
very
carefully
in
this
regard
because
the
court
did
not
say
that
the
commission
failed
to
respond
to
the
comments
of
under
--
of
other
agencies
when
it
issued
its
impact
statement.
on
page
31
(a),
what
the
court
said
is
the
commission
did
not
order
its
conclusions
in
response
to
comments
of
other
agencies.
while
the
other
agencies
for
example
on
page
706
of
the
appendix,
the
counsel
and
environmental
quality
gave
a
comment
to
the
commission
when
it
issued
its
impact
statement.
it
said,
“we
are
aware
of
the
difficulties
in
accomplishing
everything
that
we
think
you
should
do
in
a
short
time.”
and
therefore,
what
we
suggest
is
you
postpone
any
rate
increases
on
recyclables
pending
completion
of
ex
parte
270,
the
separate
proceeding.
the
commission's
response
to
that
suggestion
was
you're
right,
we're
going
to
go
ahead
with
ex
parte
270
but
we
can't
postpone
increases
on
recyclables
because
under
157
of
the
act
we
can
only
--
we
can't
say
that
well,
we're
not
going
to
allow
this
increase
to
go
into
effect
to
seven
months
because
we're
not
sure
what
effect
is
going
to
happen.
under
157
of
the
act,
the
commission
has
to
say,
“we're
going
to
allow
the
increase
to
go
into
effect
unless
we
have
solid
evidence
that
it
would
be
unjust
and
unreasonable.”
therefore,
the
commission
had
to
allow
the
increase
to
go
into
effect.
there
are
number
of
other
comments
that
were
made.
i
submit
that
the
comments
of
other
agencies
here
were
answered,
were
responded
to
if
you
read
through
the
impact
statement
it's
replete
with
responses
to
comments
of
other
agencies
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
i'd
like
to
conclude
by
just
saying
one
word
about
the
hearing
requirement.
the
district
court
said
that
when
this
goes
back,
the
icc
has
to
conduct
in
oral
hearing.
nepa
does
not
require
oral
hearings.
157
of
the
intestate
commerce
act
does
not
require
oral
hearings.
somehow,
the
district
court
put
those
two
statutes
together
and
came
up
with
the
requirement
of
oral
hearings.
we're
not
entirely
clear
why
and
we
don't
think
that
kind
of
analysis
should
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
therefore,
we
ask
for
reversal.
