mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
white,
i'd
like
to
pick
up
for
the
question
that
you
just
ended
with.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
in
this
case,
the
district
court
did
not
charge
the
commission
with
failing
to
respond
to
the
comments
of
other
agencies.
what
the
district
court
said
precisely
on
page
31
(a)
of
its
opinion
is
that
the
commission
responded
but
it
failed
to
order
its
conclusions,
not
that
it
didn't
respond,
it
simply
failed
to
order
its
conclusions
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
throughout
this
entire
impact
statement
the
commission
responded
again
and
again
and
again
to
the
various
comments
of
the
federal
agencies.
for
example,
epa,
ceq,
department
of
commerce
thought
the
commission
should
engaged
in
a
study
regarding
whether
increases
or
cost
justified
for
each
recyclable
commodity.
on
page
149
of
the
appendix,
the
commission
responded.
it
said,
that
burden
with
thrust
to
railroads
--
thrust
upon
a
railroads
to
cost
justifying
increase
rates
on
each
of
tens
of
thousands
of
commodities
between
hundred
of
thousands
of
points
“could
ensnare
the
railroads
in
a
morassic
calculations
from
which
they
have
never
be
able
to
instruct
themselves.”
gsa
said
that
the
icc
should
keep
transportation
of
recyclable
commodities
under
continued
surveillance.
at
page
158
of
the
appendix,
the
icc
responded
will
do
so.
it's
doing
so
in
ex
parte
270.
the
commerce
commission
or
the
commerce
department,
epa
and
ceq
all
said,
“examine
the
present
rate
structure.”
at
pages
24
to
58
of
the
commission's
environmental
impact
statement,
the
commission
said,
whether
the
increases
and
rates
over
the
years
have
cause
the
misalignment
or
discrimination
against
certain
commodities
as
a
matter
we're
studying
in
ex
parte
270
at
which
is
on-going
investigation
of
the
entire
rate
structure.
interior
department
suggested
that
the
icc
included
table
of
contents
to
its
impact
statement.
you'll
see
it
at
appendix
page
199,
the
icc
did
so.
interior
department
or
the
ceq
said
that
the
icc
failed
to
analyze
the
effect
on
investment
decisions.
the
icc
responded
to
that
at
page
157
on
and
on
and
on,
this
whole
impact
statement
nocuously
enough.
the
icc
has
responded
to
all
these
comments.
the
one
curious
thing
is
that
the
other
agencies
haven't
responded
to
the
icc's
response.
i
don't
know
where
one
cuts
off
to
this
dialogue
back
and
forth.
but
it
seems
to
me
as
i
stated
originally
that
the
point
that
the
district
court
made
and
said
was
the
fundamental
defect
in
the
icc's
impact
statement
on
page
34
(a)
of
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
its
failure
to
discuss
the
underlying
rate
structure
and
ceq
said
to
the
icc,
you
ought
to
do
that.
now,
we
understand
your
time
constraints
said
do
it.
what
you
should
do
is
hold
down
the
rates
on
recyclables
and
continue
investigation
as
other
have
proceeding
ex
parte
270.
the
icc
said
we
don't
have
any
power
to
do
that
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
i
take
that
the
icc
have
all
of
these
agencies
as
the
expert
on
that
question.
i
would
also
like
in
the
time
remaining
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention.
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
talk
about
supplemental
brief
that
was
filed
yesterday.
the
supplemental
brief
was
filed
by
counsel
for
nari
and
it's
a
green
sort
of
an
off-green
color.
and
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
pages
14
(a)
to
15
(a)
of
that
supplemental
brief
which
is
of
buff
green
in
color.
that
contains
the
letter
from
epa
that
was
directed
to
the
solicitor
general.
the
letters
dated
i
believe
february
the
4th.
if
you
take
that
letter
and
compare
it
to
pages
10
to
11
of
the
scra
brief,
you'll
notice
something
quite
peculiar.
beginning
at
the
bottom
of
page
10
of
the
scrap
brief
which
is
the
large
green
copy
and
carrying
over
the
page
12
of
the
scrap
brief.
there's
a
whole
series
of
quotations
that
i
pointed
out
originally
in
my
opening
argument.
we
think
we're
taking
completely
out
of
context
and
distorted
what
the
commission
found
in
later
proceedings.
the
exact
same
quotations
appear
in
exactly
the
same
form
in
the
epa
letter
to
the
solicitor
general.
we
think
the
epa
and
i
might
add
that
the
epa
letter
came
to
the
solicitor
general's
office
one
week
before
the
scrap
brief
was
filed.
i
don't
think
i
have
to
say
much
more
about
that.
the
other
point
is
that
it's
been
great
to
have
talked
about
what
significance
ex
parte
295
has
here.
the
scrap
people
tell
you
that
the
commission
has
now
quantified
its
finding.
it's
given
you
numbers
but
they
failed
to
point
out
is
that
just
last
week
mr.
merrigan
filed
a
suit
almost
the
same
as
this
challenging
ex
parte
295,
the
commission's
later
findings.
why?
because
in
ex
parte
295
as
in
ex
parte
281,
as
in
every
general
revenue
proceeding
the
commission's
had,
it
has
not
been
able
to
examine
the
underlying
rate
structure
which
is
supposedly
the
fundamental
defect
that
the
district
court
found.
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
commission
to
examine
the
underlying
rate
structure
in
a
proceeding
which
is
coming
now
at
the
rate
of
every
six
months.
the
district
court
said
that
that
was
the
fundamental
deficiency
in
the
commission's
decision
failed
to
examine
the
underlying
rate
structure.
i
repeat
that
the
point
that
we
want
to
get
across
here
most
emphatically
is
that
in
a
general
revenue
proceeding,
the
commission
cannot
order
the
underlying
rate
structure.
all
it
can
simply
do
is
look
at
whether
the
increases
are
cost
justified,
whether
the
revenues
that
the
railroads
are
bringing
in
as
opposed
to
their
cost
justify
an
increase.
the
ex
parte
310
that
was
served
in
the
court
this
morning
shows
that
the
commission's
findings
are
clearly
correct.
the
railroad
suffered
the
greatest
losses
since
the
depression
of
the
first
quarter
of
this
year.
thank
you.
