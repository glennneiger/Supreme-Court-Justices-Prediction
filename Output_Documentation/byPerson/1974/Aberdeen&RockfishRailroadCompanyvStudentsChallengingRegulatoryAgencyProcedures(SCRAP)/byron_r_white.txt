how
long
do
you
say
was
the
decision
in
some
40
years
ago
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
judge
chesnut
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

going
to
be
my
question,
to
follow
consistently
with
no
dissents
from
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
all
summary
actions
of
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
--
are
all
three
in
the
1969
terms?
justice
byron
r.
white
electronic
was
opposed,
is
that
affirmance?
justice
byron
r.
white
simply
affirmance?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
efficiency
in
this
order
of
the
three-judge
court
“vacated”
the
orders
of
the
commission
“ordered”
the
commission
to
conduct
“further
proceedings?”
now,
what's
the
efficiency
in
that
on
the
--
1253
terms?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they've
ordered
the
commissioner
to
conduct
further
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
what
about
the
word
“ordered?”
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that's
sort
of
an
injunctive,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
injunction
was
sought?
justice
byron
r.
white
53
means
only
that
would
satisfy
rule
55
affirmance?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
this
letter
we
have
in
solicitor
general
that
we
just
got
this
morning?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
refers
to
this
supplemental?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
relation
to
your
argument
as
your
argument
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
he
has
said,
his
criticism?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
they
must
in
effect
write
an
opinion
that
covers
all
the
points
you
think
should
be
covered?
otherwise,
there's
been
a
procedural
default?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
they
admit
to
discuss
and
dispose
of
a
suggestion
by
an
agency
expressly?
do
you
take
it
there's
been
a
procedure
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
for
some
issues
that's
true.
if
they
don't
expressly
say
something
about
it,
there's
been
a
default.

in
73-1966
and
73-1971
so-called
"scrap
case".
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction
from
appeal
on
an
appeal
for
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia.
this
case
has
a
long
and
complicated
history
which
i
need
not
go
into
right
now.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
given
inadequate
attention
to
environmental
factors
in
refusing
to
declare
unlawful
a
general
revenue
rate
increase
which
the
nation's
railroads
had
filed.
the
district
court
ordered
that
the
commission
should
conduct
further
proceedings
in
which
it
would
give
more
explicit
attention
to
environmental
concerns
by
filing
a
new
environmental
impact
statement.
for
the
reasons
given
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
conclude
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction,
that
we
in
turn
have
jurisdiction
over
this
appeal,
and
that
the
district
court
erred
in
several
respects,
in
ruling
that
the
icc
should
conduct
further
proceedings
in
this
case.
we
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
in
this
case.
