mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
i'm
charles
khoury.
and
several
years
ago
when
lieutenant
ballard
came
to
my
office
and
asked
me
for
help
in
this
situation,
i
knew
it
was
a
unique
case
and
i
was
able
to
discern
after
a
short
time
that
it
involved
the
issue
which
is
before
the
court
now.
sex
discrimination,
he
sought
me
out
because
i
had
been
in
the
navy
for
11
years
and
he
knew
that
i
graduated
form
the
naval
academy
that
accounts
for
four
of
11
years.
and
i
was
familiar
with
the
problems
that
are
involved
in
promotion,
i
was
familiar
with
the
problems
of
a
mustang
and
having
an
individual
who
walks
into
your
office
and
has
17
years
of
active
duty
which
is
creditable
towards
a
20
year
retirement
and
he's
about
and
if
he
were
a
woman
he
would
have,
he'd
be
over
the
top,
he
would
be
able
to
retire.
and
of
course,
this
was
the
overriding
issue,
this
is
overriding
is
concern
as
mrs.
shapiro
stated
from
lieutenant
ballard.
and
it
was
a
simple
as
that,
it
is
as
simple
as
that.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
right
now
at
this
instant
he
will
retire
in
february
of
1975
which
is
about
4
months
from
now.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
i
mean
he
would,
but
that's
another
issues
that
i
want
to
talked
about
is
mootness
of
this
case
but
i'm
saving
that
for
the
end
of
that.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
exactly,
and
if
he
will
win
this
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
but
let
me
state
what
i'm
going
to
talk
about
briefly
outline,
i'm
going
to
talk
about
the
rational
basis.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
sounds
like
in
its
fullness,
doesn't
it?
but
at
any
rate
the
relief
--
i'm
going
to
talk
about
whether
there
is
any
rational
basis
to
support
this
particular
statute
and
what
relief
should
be
granted
and
then
i'm
ready
to
talked
about
why
this
appeal
might
be
dismissed.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
your
honor,
i
feel
that
the
compelling
interest
test
would
apply
here,
however
we're
talking
about
if
the
court
were
to
find
a
rational
basis
i
feel
that
that
would
also
be
a
compelling
interest
in
this
particular
situation.
i
feel
that
there's
no
reason
not
to
apply
a
compelling
interest
here
because
this
not
a
kahn
versus
shevin
situation
namely
protective
legislation
being
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
and
so
i'm
not
at
all
saying,
i'm
responding
to
what
mrs.
shapiro
said
about
a
rational
basis
and
our
brief
i
talk.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
but
at
any
rate,
i
agree
that
con
is
not
applicable
here,
but
basically
what
mrs.
shapiro
is
saying
is
that
because
this
is
going
to
cause
a
great
problem
there's
a
military
necessity
for
doing
this,
in
other
words,
it's
the
reasoning
backward
problem.
and
this
court
has
been
faced
before
with
situations
where
attorney's
have
said
that
the
courts
--
if
the
court
implements
this
decision
in
other
words,
if
the
court
finds
something
unconstitutional
it's
going
to
cause
a
great
problem.
and
in
the
integration
cases
i'm
sure
that
was
argued
to
the
court
that
great
problem
would
occur
in
the
implementation
of
the
decision
by
the
court
namely
that
integration
must
occur.
and
what
mrs.
shapiro
is
doing
is
talking
about
the
relief
aspect
and
then
using
that
--
the
difficulties
saying
that
there's
going
to
be
difficult
relief
and
then
using
that
to
say
that
there
is
a
compelling
military
necessity
to
continue
the
same
scheme.
namely
a
separate
system
for
women
and
a
separate
system
for
men
as
far
as
selection
out
is
concern.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
we
should
not
confused
that
and
i
also
want
to
talk
about
the
figures
that
are
being
talked
about
here
is
namely
in
the
court
below
the
only
people
who
had
the
same
amount
of
years
as
mr.
ballard
or
more
were
nine,
nine
people.
that
was
an
affidavit
that
was
filed
by
admiral
force
and
it's
in
the
appendix
and
of
course,
the
court
below
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
officer
and
enlisted
man,
i'm
talking
about
total
number
of
years
in
the
navy
officer
and
enlisted
men.
there
were
nine
people
who
had
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
her
figure
about
lieutenants
who
would
be
covered
by
the
statute
10
u.s.c.
6382
the
whole
number
of
lieutenants
is
correct.
in
other
words
this
200
figure.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
talking
about
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
the
statute
talks
about.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
no.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
let
me
talk
about
this
your
honor
too.
since
we're
talking
about
the
number
of
people
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
how
many
people
are
actually
going
to,
if
the
court
finds
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
how
many
lieutenants
are
actually
going
to
say
i
want
to
stay
in
the
navy
for
an
extra
one
or
two
years.
now
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
okay,
the
point
is
that
she
is
trying
to
stay.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
one
person,
one
person
it's
not
possibly.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right
and
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
we're
talking
about
one
person
here
and
the
government
is
arguing
that
we're
going
to
bring
the,
you
know,
have
a
whole
lot
of
people
600
people
over
33
years.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
that's
what
i
suggest
that
the
court
do
here
is
worry
about
the
cases,
the
class
action
when
it
comes
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
one
person,
and
it
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would
affect
only
those
people
who
opted
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
that's
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
you
see
what
i'm
getting
at.
in
other
words
it
would
be
only
those
what
the
court
did
since
the
government
is
talking
about
the
effectiveness.
let
me
talk
about
what
happened
after
this,
in
other
words,
the
class
action
was
filed
and
the
court,
the
three-judge
court
below
allowed
individuals
to
opt
whether
or
not
to
stay
in
as
if
for
the
13
years
or
to
get
out,
and
isn't
that
the
figure
and
that
case
hasn't
gone
to
trial
yet
â€“
that's
still
down
in
the
district
court
in
san
diego,
and
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
we
shouldn't
be
talking
about
figures
that
have
not
been
subject
to
trial
and
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
when
i
talk
about
an
improperly
presented
federal
question
because
i
really
believe
that
this
question
has
been
improperly
presented
to
this
court.
last
minute
affidavits
but
i
want
to
go
on
and
talk
about
this,
this
idea
of
the
rationale
that
the
government
has
put
up
saying
that
they
need
this
statute.
this
10
years
10
u.s.c
6382
and
has
opposed
from
and
the
ten
us
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
having
the
different
treatment
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
we're
not
questioning
selection
of
procedures,
i'm
talking
about
the
situation
where
there
is
a
rational
basis
or
compelling
interest
to
have
different
treatment
or
women
as
opposed
to
men,
and
they
talk
about
a
combat
needs.
in
other
words,
a
tremendous
increase
of
combat
individuals.
well
from
my
own
experience,
that
whenever
you
have
an
increase
and
necessity
of
getting
combat
individuals
the
support
people
are
needed.
for
every
combat
individual
there
are
three
or
four
individuals
who
have
to
support
that
individual
and
so
this
need
of
--
this
expanding
of
the
service
cuts
across
just
the
males,
it
cuts
across
that
and
into
the
women
also
and
of
course,
basically
all
the
government's
argument
here
is
that
because
this
may
cause
some
fiscal
inconvenience
to
the
navy,
then
what
makes
it
the
military
necessity
and
there
is
a
compelling
interest
to
have
disparate
treatment
between
men
and
women.
and
we
can't
argue
backwards
and
say
because
it's
hard
and
it
maybe
hard,
and
i'm
conceding
that
it
is
because
as
i
was
talking
to
justice
marshall,
we
don't
know
exactly
how
many
people
would
opt
to
take
advantage
of
the
statute.
the
women
have
the
extra
the
13
years,
lieutenant
ballad
obviously
is
opting
to
take
advantage
of
that
because
he
can
retire
but
it's
going
to
be
a
very
small
number
of
in
generally
mustangs
as
justice
stewart
says,
and
that's
the
name
that
the
navy
uses
individuals
who
have
been
enlisted
men
and
then
go
into
the
officer
ranks.
and
i
want
to
respond
to
the
--
it
was
very
clear
and
the
court
below
found
after
trial
that
this
is
a
very
highly
qualified
officer
and
on
substantial
evidences,
this
was
a
very
highly
qualified
officer
and
his
fitness
reports
were
outstanding
and
during
the
period
of
time
at
the
temporary
restraining
order
he
did
very
well
and
there
were
additional
fitness
reports
were
submitted
by
his
command
showing
that
they
recommended
him
for
promotion
every
time
and
so
it
is
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
it
talks
about
the
turn
of
the
calendar.
in
other
words,
if
this
is
only
a
turn
of
the
calendar
and
i'm
responding
to
the
government's
statement
about
a
less
qualified
individual
but
correct,
in
other
words,
the
constitutional
issue
is
whether
or
not
similarly
situated
people
whether
or
not
similarly
situated
women
has
the
better
situation
whether
a
similar
situated
man
is
discriminated
against
by
statutory
here.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor,
and
another
point
that
i
want
to
talk
about
that
has
to
do
with
this
constitutional
issue
is
the
assertion
that
women
are
also
subject
to
the
same
statute.
i'm
complaining
is
applied
to
my
man
and
that
was
discussed
below
and
evidence
was
taken
below
on
that
issue
and
the
court
found
that
no
woman
had
been
discharged
under
10
u.s.c.
6382.
that's
in
the
three-
judge
court's
opinion
and
i
wanted
to
make
that
perfectly
clear
that
they
found
that
in
fact
no
women
had
been
discharge
under
this
statute
which
the
government
is
saying,
well
it
really
does
apply
to
some
women.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
namely,
in
other
words,
that
no
--
well
the
government
is
trying
to
say
that
basically
that
there
has
been
a
detriment,in
other
words,
a
detriment
equally
applies
to
women
and
i
guess
what
the
court
is
saying
is
that
maybe
no
women
has
ever
been
passed
over
that
is
subject
to
--
twice
that
was
subject
to
the
statute
and
that's
a
possible
interpretation.
but
getting
on
to
the,
to
the
relief
now
in
other
words,
we
talked
about
the
fact
that
there
is
a
disparate
treatment
here
of
men
and
women
similarly
situated.
now,
what
is
the
relief
and
that's
really
what
the
government
is
complaining
about,
that's
really
what
is
hurting
the
government
here
is
that
they're
worried
about
the
relief,
not
whether
or
not
there
is
a
constitutional
deprivation
because
that
really
has
to
be
clear
from
the
record
especially
when
it
was
clear
at
the
time
congress
enacted
this
13
year
statute
but
they
were
just
trying
to
make
it
be
the
same
time
as
men
and
that's
very
clear
from
the
record,
but
there
was
never,
that
congress
wasn't
attempting
any
protective
legislation
or
anything
of
that
nature
when
they
enacted
this
13
year
protector
statute
to
women.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
basically,
what
happened
is
that
a
restriction
on
time
and
grade
was
listed
by
an
executive
order,
presidential
order
and
the
latest
one
was
signed
by
president
johnson
in
1958
which
took
away
a
restriction
that's
--
before
it
used
to
have
to
be
an
(inaudible)
in
a
certain
amount
of
time
and
then
lieutenant
jg
a
certain
amount
of
time,
before
he
was
even
eligible
for
promotion.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
basically,
it
says
the
suspension
order
says
this
is
a
national
emergency.
one
of
the
affidavits
provided
for
the
government
as
we've
been
in
this
state
of
national
emergency
for
some
many,
many
years
right
now
and
that's
true.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
and
they
did
away
with
also
this,
the
up
or
out
procedure
too
during
that
period
of
time.
nobody
was
getting
kicked
out
during
that
period
of
time
due
to
the
passovers,
because
the
president
has
the
authority
to
suspend
all
of
that.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
the
opportunity
to
judge
the
man
is
still
going
to
be
subject
to
two
passovers.
it
means
it'll
come
faster
and
his
total
time
and
service
will
be
less
maybe
by
three
years
and
if
he
is
like
the
lieutenant
ballard
he
may
not
be
able
to
retire.
that's
the
operative
effect
of
it,
not
necessarily
he
is
going
to
be
observed
more
at
all.
i
mean
in
the
navy
you're
observed
once
a
year,
no
matter
what,
on
your
fitness
reports
unless
you've
been
transferred
and
then
you
may
have
multiple
observations.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that's
right,
and
that's
exactly
right.
now
--
but
we've
must
look
at
what
congress
intended
and
we
can't
at
all
say
that
congress
did
not
--
congress
would
not
intend
the
benefit
of
the
women
not
be
applied
to
lieutenant
ballard
in
this
case.
i
mean
how
it
can
be
asserted
that
in
any
way
shape
or
form
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
in
applying
the
10
u.s.c.6401
to
lieutenant
ballard
to
cure
the
--
to
grant
the
relief
requested.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
i
never
asserted
and
didn't
mean
to
give
the
court
the
impression
that
it
was
congress's
intent
not
to
apply
6401
to
lieutenant
ballard.
in
fact,
it's
very
possible
that
congress,
in
fact
the
record
shows
that
it
was
a
congress's
intent
to
equalize
the
services
the
male
and
the
female
when
it
said
13
years
that's
conceded
by
the
government.
so
in
no
way,
shape
or
form
do
i
want
to
state
that
it
could
be
congress's
intent
not
to
give
that
benefit
because
i
mean
that's
the
relief
that
was
sought,
that's
the
relief
that
was
granted
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
congress's
intent
would
be
other
than
to
have
this
man
get
the
same
benefit
as
a
woman.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
that
was
an
executive
order
and
in
1968
and
the
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
--
because
here's
the
thing
can
we
say
that
congress
would
realized
that
the
same
statute
or
that
the
suspension
of
time
and
grade
or
the
president
would
realize
that
this
suspension
of
time
and
grade
which
causes
the
rapid
promotion
would
also
push
out
a
bunch
of
well
qualified
people,
do
you
see
what
i'm
getting
at.
i
mean
that's
really
what
the
effect
is,
you
want
to
increase
the
number,
it's
a
paradox,
you
want
to
increase
the
size
of
the
military
but
at
the
same
time
because
you're
suspending
the
time
and
grade
a
whole
bunch
of
well
qualified
people
maybe
are
getting
pushed
out.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
because
it's
in
the
record
that
congress
made
13
years
in
the
women
statute
so
it
would
equal
the
male
statute.
that
was
their
reasoning.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
it
would
apply
if
in
fact,
the
department
of
defense
bill
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
if
the
other
214
were
to
join
in
this
lawsuit,
they
--
depending
on
how
many
years
they
had
been
in
the
service.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
i'm
just
saying,
your
honor,
that
we
can't
assume
that
it
would
be
the
intent
of
congress
to
deny
lieutenant
ballard
of
this
extra
three
years,
that's
the
assumption
that
we
can't
make.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
that's
a
separate
lawsuit
that
maybe
completely
decided
by
the
changing
of
the
slot.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
basically
we're
talking
about
men
who,
they
haven't
intervened
and
we're
up
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
anybody
who
was
subject
to
discharge
of
that
statute
and
if
the
statute
is
declared
unconstitutional
could
be
subject
to
that,
but
this
is
not
a
class
action
even
though
the
government
is
talking
about
it
like
it's
a
class
action.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
we
don't
attack
the
selection
out
procedure,
your
honor,
just
as
the
government
stated
we
don't
attack
that.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
but
what
if
you
inject
sex
into
that
pushing
out
of
well
qualified
people
and
that's
really
what
our
problem
is,
because
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
selection
--
the
up
or
out
selection
procedure
â€“
so
it
is
a
hard
procedure
but
i'm
not
attacking
it
here,
i
can't
really
but
if
it's
tied
to
sex
i
can
and
have
and
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
i
have
a
hard
time
with
that,
i
couldn't
find
any
intent
of
congress
to
that
effect
and
i'm
wondering
about
justifying
a
discriminatory
scheme
by
saying
that
it's
to
make
up
for
another
discrimination
and
we're
not
in
an
attack
situation
like
congress
or
shevin.
what
i
think
the
government
is
trying
to
do
there
is
to
bring
this
case
--
to
attempt
to
bring
this
case
within
a
rationale
congress
or
shevin
to
say
that
this
is
really
remedial
or
compensatory
legislation
and
the
record
doesn't
support
that.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
no
your
honor.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
what
actually
--
what
the
government
stated
is
that
these
nine
people
that
i
mentioned
before
are
subject
--
in
mr.
ballard's
case
who
did
not
have
20
years
in
or
19
Â½
years
because
they
rounded
off
to
20,
who
do
not
have
that
period
of
the
time
in
--
they
were
kept
in
under
10
u.s.c.
1006
(e)
which
is
called
the
continuation
program
and
when
you
get
within
two
years
of
retirement
you
are
eligible
for
that
program.
now,
he
is
very,
he
is
lot
closer
than
two
years
retirement.
he
was
not
within
two
years
retirement
when
we
brought
the
lawsuit.
he
is
within
four
months
of
retirement
right
now,
and
so
i
feel
that
the
navy
under
10
u.s.c.
1006
(e)
will
go
ahead
and
retire
the
man
anyway.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is
such
a
late
suggestion
on
my
part
is
that
i
just
came
across
odegaard
and
that
logic,
and
defunis
v.
odegaard
yesterday
in
researching
this
and
i
felt
that
i
must
bring
that
up
to
the
court.
also
the
idea
of
dismissing
this
appeal
on
the
idea
of
the
fact
that
the
federal
question
hasn't
been
properly
presented,
so
much
of
what
i've
been
talking
about
here
has
been
affidavits
and
what
the
government
has
been
putting
forth
were
presented
in
affidavits
which
presented
after
the
trial
in
this
case
in
a
motion
for
new
trial.
they
have
never
been
responded
to
by
lieutenant
ballard
because
the
trial
was
over,
and
that's
not
a
proper
way
to
bring
the
federal
question
before
this
court
as
i
said
in
my
brief
and
i
did
raise
this
in
my
brief
that
the
federal
question
is
not
properly
presented.
it
would
be
best
for
the
court,
if
the
court
isn't
going
to
rule
in
favor
of
me
and
my
client
on
the
merits.
it
would
be
best
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
have
the
question
properly
presented
or
if
again
the
court
isn't
going
to
rule
in
favor
of
my
client
on
the
merits
in
this
case
and
fine
number
one
that
there
was
a
constitutional
deprivation,
sex
discrimination
here
and
grant
the
same
relief
that
was
granted
below.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
your
honor,
the
whole
point
of
their
affidavits
is
the
pandora's
box
argument
that
i've
alluded
to
before,
namely,
words
to
the
effect
that
the
navy
is
going
to
come
it's
screeching
halt
if
the
court
implements
this
relief.
not
that
there
is
a
discrimination
but
that
the
relief
is
going
to
be
very
hard
on
the
navy
and
that's
what
i'm
contesting,
that
i've
never
had
a
chance
to
contest
by
a
way
of
interrogatory,
that
never
stood
the
test
of
trial
because
let
me
say
this,
that
there
are
actually
in
my
experience
and
here
i'm
doing
the
same
thing
that
i'm
saying
the
government
is
doing
i
don't
want
to
be
testifying
but
there
are
very
few
people
who
are
going
to
take
advantage
of
this
so
it
can't
bring
the
navy
to
his
screeching
halt.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
there
are
a
lot
of
facts
which
have
been
spoken
to
by
the
government
in
an
attempt
to
support
a
rational
basis
which
would
never
raise
before
and
that's
and
i
contest
their
accuracy.
i'm
contesting
that
even
it
is
that
they
make
a
rational
basis
and
so
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
oh!
no
your
honor,
no
that's
not
true
i
mean
because
of
the
fact
that
we
would
be,
i
would
be
able
to
tell
the
court
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
not
200
people
that
are
taking
advantage
of
this
lawsuit
but
maybe
20.
did
you
see
the
difference
in
that?
i
mean
their
whole
basis
is
that
this
is
causing
an
administrative
problem
with
the
navy
and
a
money
problem
with
the
navy
that's
really
what
their
whole
argument
is
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
meets
the
rational
basis
test
at
all.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
10
u.s.c.
6382.
did
it
precede
the
admission?
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor,
and
all
that
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
the
scheme
is
unconstitutional
and
the
point
is
in
the
two
ways
that
we
approach
this,
the
court
below
has
the
decision
what
were
they
going
to
do,
what
relief
were
they
going
to
grant
and
then
that's
the
decision
that
they
had
to
make
is
to
try
to
figure
out
what
congress
intended.
in
other
words,
when
you
say
which
statue
i
don't
like
to
say
that
one
or
the
other
is
unconstitutional
because
for
one
thing
10
u.s.c.
6382
did
not
combine
women
in
it.
so
i
had
to
argue
that
two
statutes
in
the
same
sections
10
u.s.c.
operating
together
as
a
whole
were
unconstitutional,
does
the
court
see
what
i'm
getting
at
and
that's
what
my
arguments
was
below.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
i
think
the
chronology
would
help
in
figuring
out
what
the
intent
of
congress
is
your
honor
and
that's
what
the
court
has
to
do
when
they're
granting
relief.
in
other
words,
we
can
conclude
on
the
merits
that
there
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination.
the
question
is
what
to
do
about
it
and
the
court
below
took
the
action
that
they
did
and
i'm
talking
about
the
fact
here
now
that
there
is
ample
justification
to
support
their
assumption
that
this
is
what
congress
would
do.
now,
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
because
of
the
fact
that
at
the
time
the
lawsuit
was
filed
he
did
not
come
within
the
relief
established
in
this
and
i'm
referring,
let
me
just
refer
the
court
specifically
to
the
brief
and
the
government
alluded
to
it
in
the
oral
argument
but
basically
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
5,
footnote
6,
there
is
a
statement
about
this
long
standing
policy
of
the
navy
to
retire
individuals
when
they've
gotten
within
two
years
of
retirement
and
then
there's
a
forbes's
affidavit
which
is
in
appendix
9
(a)
and
then
there's
also
an
affidavit
which
is
not
in
the
appendix
but
which
is
in
the
record
of
this
case
which
was
filed
by
the
government
which
stated
that
yes
in
fact,
the
navy
does
have
this
long
standing
policy
to
retire
individuals
when
they
get
within
two
years
of
retirement
and
it's
supported
by
statute
and
that's
what
i
cited
the
statute
10
u.s.c
1006
e
and
that
he
is
now
within
that
and
itâ€˜s
my
understanding
that
he
is
going
to
be
retired
on
that,
that
they
really
--
based
on
the
navy's
long
standing
policy
what
is
there
to
exempt
him
from
that
long
standing.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
february
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
let
me
state
what
that
situation
is.
it
is
the
long
standing
policy
all
nine
of
the
officers
who
were
in
lieutenant
ballads
class
and
this
group
of
people,
who
were
two
years
--
within
two
years
they
were
all
retired,
in
the
new
bill
that
becomes
mandatory,
let
me
say
something
further,
that
in
the
new
bill
that
the
government
was
talking
about,
he
has
no
problem.
none
of
this
people
have
any
problem
in
this
new
bill
they
all
have
equity,
they
get
large
equity
payments
--
a
lot
of
this
is
taken
care
of
but
it's
true
your
honor,
it's
this
10
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that's
right
in
other
words
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
you
resign
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
exactly.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
oh!
well
it
will
just
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
as
a
practical
--
yes
your
honor,
as
a
practical
matter
he
will
be
able
to
stay
until
retirement
which
his
retirement
is,
well
his
retirement
actually
even
if
he
stays
in
until
february
16,
1975
that's
retirement
that's
19
Â½
years,
you
mean
in
19
Â½
years
february
16th
1975.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
very
close
to
it.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
very
--
it
will
be
very
close
to
it
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
your
honor,
i
was
in
dismissing
i'm
talking
about
that
in
the
context
of
dismissing
the
appeal.
i
felt
that
the
court
would
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
grounds
of
number
one;
if
for
example,
it
was
improperly
presented
federal
question.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
may
i
suggest
something
to
the
court
then,
because
this
is
a
very
important
point
and
i'm
only
raising
for
the
first
time.
i
would
like
to
submit
refund.
additional
refund
is
issued
because
it
is
so
important
and
obviously
i
don't
want
any
way,
shape
or
form
to
be
asking
the
court
to
do
something
that
will
undercut
the
victory
that
was
one
below
and
so
i
would
ask
to
be
able
to
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
the
court
puts
me
in
a
tough
position,
i
don't
see
how
--
if
the
--
if
my
client
is
going
to
be
--
is
to
get
this
retirement
which
is
--
which
was
really
the
ultimate
of
the
lawsuit,
i
don't
see
how
i
could
object.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
i'm
charles
khoury.
and
several
years
ago
when
lieutenant
ballard
came
to
my
office
and
asked
me
for
help
in
this
situation,
i
knew
it
was
a
unique
case
and
i
was
able
to
discern
after
a
short
time
that
it
involved
the
issue
which
is
before
the
court
now.
sex
discrimination,
he
sought
me
out
because
i
had
been
in
the
navy
for
11
years
and
he
knew
that
i
graduated
form
the
naval
academy
that
accounts
for
four
of
11
years.
and
i
was
familiar
with
the
problems
that
are
involved
in
promotion,
i
was
familiar
with
the
problems
of
a
mustang
and
having
an
individual
who
walks
into
your
office
and
has
17
years
of
active
duty
which
is
creditable
towards
a
20
year
retirement
and
he's
about
and
if
he
were
a
woman
he
would
have,
he'd
be
over
the
top,
he
would
be
able
to
retire.
and
of
course,
this
was
the
overriding
issue,
this
is
overriding
is
concern
as
mrs.
shapiro
stated
from
lieutenant
ballard.
and
it
was
a
simple
as
that,
it
is
as
simple
as
that.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
right
now
at
this
instant
he
will
retire
in
february
of
1975
which
is
about
4
months
from
now.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
i
mean
he
would,
but
that's
another
issues
that
i
want
to
talked
about
is
mootness
of
this
case
but
i'm
saving
that
for
the
end
of
that.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
exactly,
and
if
he
will
win
this
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor.
but
let
me
state
what
i'm
going
to
talk
about
briefly
outline,
i'm
going
to
talk
about
the
rational
basis.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
sounds
like
in
its
fullness,
doesn't
it?
but
at
any
rate
the
relief
--
i'm
going
to
talk
about
whether
there
is
any
rational
basis
to
support
this
particular
statute
and
what
relief
should
be
granted
and
then
i'm
ready
to
talked
about
why
this
appeal
might
be
dismissed.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
your
honor,
i
feel
that
the
compelling
interest
test
would
apply
here,
however
we're
talking
about
if
the
court
were
to
find
a
rational
basis
i
feel
that
that
would
also
be
a
compelling
interest
in
this
particular
situation.
i
feel
that
there's
no
reason
not
to
apply
a
compelling
interest
here
because
this
not
a
kahn
versus
shevin
situation
namely
protective
legislation
being
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
and
so
i'm
not
at
all
saying,
i'm
responding
to
what
mrs.
shapiro
said
about
a
rational
basis
and
our
brief
i
talk.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
but
at
any
rate,
i
agree
that
con
is
not
applicable
here,
but
basically
what
mrs.
shapiro
is
saying
is
that
because
this
is
going
to
cause
a
great
problem
there's
a
military
necessity
for
doing
this,
in
other
words,
it's
the
reasoning
backward
problem.
and
this
court
has
been
faced
before
with
situations
where
attorney's
have
said
that
the
courts
--
if
the
court
implements
this
decision
in
other
words,
if
the
court
finds
something
unconstitutional
it's
going
to
cause
a
great
problem.
and
in
the
integration
cases
i'm
sure
that
was
argued
to
the
court
that
great
problem
would
occur
in
the
implementation
of
the
decision
by
the
court
namely
that
integration
must
occur.
and
what
mrs.
shapiro
is
doing
is
talking
about
the
relief
aspect
and
then
using
that
--
the
difficulties
saying
that
there's
going
to
be
difficult
relief
and
then
using
that
to
say
that
there
is
a
compelling
military
necessity
to
continue
the
same
scheme.
namely
a
separate
system
for
women
and
a
separate
system
for
men
as
far
as
selection
out
is
concern.
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
we
should
not
confused
that
and
i
also
want
to
talk
about
the
figures
that
are
being
talked
about
here
is
namely
in
the
court
below
the
only
people
who
had
the
same
amount
of
years
as
mr.
ballard
or
more
were
nine,
nine
people.
that
was
an
affidavit
that
was
filed
by
admiral
force
and
it's
in
the
appendix
and
of
course,
the
court
below
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
officer
and
enlisted
man,
i'm
talking
about
total
number
of
years
in
the
navy
officer
and
enlisted
men.
there
were
nine
people
who
had
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
her
figure
about
lieutenants
who
would
be
covered
by
the
statute
10
u.s.c.
6382
the
whole
number
of
lieutenants
is
correct.
in
other
words
this
200
figure.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
what
i'm
talking
about
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
the
statute
talks
about.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
no.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
let
me
talk
about
this
your
honor
too.
since
we're
talking
about
the
number
of
people
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
how
many
people
are
actually
going
to,
if
the
court
finds
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
how
many
lieutenants
are
actually
going
to
say
i
want
to
stay
in
the
navy
for
an
extra
one
or
two
years.
now
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
okay,
the
point
is
that
she
is
trying
to
stay.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
one
person,
one
person
it's
not
possibly.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right
and
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that
we're
talking
about
one
person
here
and
the
government
is
arguing
that
we're
going
to
bring
the,
you
know,
have
a
whole
lot
of
people
600
people
over
33
years.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
that's
what
i
suggest
that
the
court
do
here
is
worry
about
the
cases,
the
class
action
when
it
comes
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
one
person,
and
it
declared
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
as
a
practical
matter,
it
would
affect
only
those
people
who
opted
to
take
advantage
of
it
and
that's
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
you
see
what
i'm
getting
at.
in
other
words
it
would
be
only
those
what
the
court
did
since
the
government
is
talking
about
the
effectiveness.
let
me
talk
about
what
happened
after
this,
in
other
words,
the
class
action
was
filed
and
the
court,
the
three-judge
court
below
allowed
individuals
to
opt
whether
or
not
to
stay
in
as
if
for
the
13
years
or
to
get
out,
and
isn't
that
the
figure
and
that
case
hasn't
gone
to
trial
yet
â€“
that's
still
down
in
the
district
court
in
san
diego,
and
that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
we
shouldn't
be
talking
about
figures
that
have
not
been
subject
to
trial
and
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
when
i
talk
about
an
improperly
presented
federal
question
because
i
really
believe
that
this
question
has
been
improperly
presented
to
this
court.
last
minute
affidavits
but
i
want
to
go
on
and
talk
about
this,
this
idea
of
the
rationale
that
the
government
has
put
up
saying
that
they
need
this
statute.
this
10
years
10
u.s.c
6382
and
has
opposed
from
and
the
ten
us
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
having
the
different
treatment
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
we're
not
questioning
selection
of
procedures,
i'm
talking
about
the
situation
where
there
is
a
rational
basis
or
compelling
interest
to
have
different
treatment
or
women
as
opposed
to
men,
and
they
talk
about
a
combat
needs.
in
other
words,
a
tremendous
increase
of
combat
individuals.
well
from
my
own
experience,
that
whenever
you
have
an
increase
and
necessity
of
getting
combat
individuals
the
support
people
are
needed.
for
every
combat
individual
there
are
three
or
four
individuals
who
have
to
support
that
individual
and
so
this
need
of
--
this
expanding
of
the
service
cuts
across
just
the
males,
it
cuts
across
that
and
into
the
women
also
and
of
course,
basically
all
the
government's
argument
here
is
that
because
this
may
cause
some
fiscal
inconvenience
to
the
navy,
then
what
makes
it
the
military
necessity
and
there
is
a
compelling
interest
to
have
disparate
treatment
between
men
and
women.
and
we
can't
argue
backwards
and
say
because
it's
hard
and
it
maybe
hard,
and
i'm
conceding
that
it
is
because
as
i
was
talking
to
justice
marshall,
we
don't
know
exactly
how
many
people
would
opt
to
take
advantage
of
the
statute.
the
women
have
the
extra
the
13
years,
lieutenant
ballad
obviously
is
opting
to
take
advantage
of
that
because
he
can
retire
but
it's
going
to
be
a
very
small
number
of
in
generally
mustangs
as
justice
stewart
says,
and
that's
the
name
that
the
navy
uses
individuals
who
have
been
enlisted
men
and
then
go
into
the
officer
ranks.
and
i
want
to
respond
to
the
--
it
was
very
clear
and
the
court
below
found
after
trial
that
this
is
a
very
highly
qualified
officer
and
on
substantial
evidences,
this
was
a
very
highly
qualified
officer
and
his
fitness
reports
were
outstanding
and
during
the
period
of
time
at
the
temporary
restraining
order
he
did
very
well
and
there
were
additional
fitness
reports
were
submitted
by
his
command
showing
that
they
recommended
him
for
promotion
every
time
and
so
it
is
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
it
talks
about
the
turn
of
the
calendar.
in
other
words,
if
this
is
only
a
turn
of
the
calendar
and
i'm
responding
to
the
government's
statement
about
a
less
qualified
individual
but
correct,
in
other
words,
the
constitutional
issue
is
whether
or
not
similarly
situated
people
whether
or
not
similarly
situated
women
has
the
better
situation
whether
a
similar
situated
man
is
discriminated
against
by
statutory
here.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor,
and
another
point
that
i
want
to
talk
about
that
has
to
do
with
this
constitutional
issue
is
the
assertion
that
women
are
also
subject
to
the
same
statute.
i'm
complaining
is
applied
to
my
man
and
that
was
discussed
below
and
evidence
was
taken
below
on
that
issue
and
the
court
found
that
no
woman
had
been
discharged
under
10
u.s.c.
6382.
that's
in
the
three-
judge
court's
opinion
and
i
wanted
to
make
that
perfectly
clear
that
they
found
that
in
fact
no
women
had
been
discharge
under
this
statute
which
the
government
is
saying,
well
it
really
does
apply
to
some
women.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
namely,
in
other
words,
that
no
--
well
the
government
is
trying
to
say
that
basically
that
there
has
been
a
detriment,in
other
words,
a
detriment
equally
applies
to
women
and
i
guess
what
the
court
is
saying
is
that
maybe
no
women
has
ever
been
passed
over
that
is
subject
to
--
twice
that
was
subject
to
the
statute
and
that's
a
possible
interpretation.
but
getting
on
to
the,
to
the
relief
now
in
other
words,
we
talked
about
the
fact
that
there
is
a
disparate
treatment
here
of
men
and
women
similarly
situated.
now,
what
is
the
relief
and
that's
really
what
the
government
is
complaining
about,
that's
really
what
is
hurting
the
government
here
is
that
they're
worried
about
the
relief,
not
whether
or
not
there
is
a
constitutional
deprivation
because
that
really
has
to
be
clear
from
the
record
especially
when
it
was
clear
at
the
time
congress
enacted
this
13
year
statute
but
they
were
just
trying
to
make
it
be
the
same
time
as
men
and
that's
very
clear
from
the
record,
but
there
was
never,
that
congress
wasn't
attempting
any
protective
legislation
or
anything
of
that
nature
when
they
enacted
this
13
year
protector
statute
to
women.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
basically,
what
happened
is
that
a
restriction
on
time
and
grade
was
listed
by
an
executive
order,
presidential
order
and
the
latest
one
was
signed
by
president
johnson
in
1958
which
took
away
a
restriction
that's
--
before
it
used
to
have
to
be
an
(inaudible)
in
a
certain
amount
of
time
and
then
lieutenant
jg
a
certain
amount
of
time,
before
he
was
even
eligible
for
promotion.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
basically,
it
says
the
suspension
order
says
this
is
a
national
emergency.
one
of
the
affidavits
provided
for
the
government
as
we've
been
in
this
state
of
national
emergency
for
some
many,
many
years
right
now
and
that's
true.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
and
they
did
away
with
also
this,
the
up
or
out
procedure
too
during
that
period
of
time.
nobody
was
getting
kicked
out
during
that
period
of
time
due
to
the
passovers,
because
the
president
has
the
authority
to
suspend
all
of
that.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
the
opportunity
to
judge
the
man
is
still
going
to
be
subject
to
two
passovers.
it
means
it'll
come
faster
and
his
total
time
and
service
will
be
less
maybe
by
three
years
and
if
he
is
like
the
lieutenant
ballard
he
may
not
be
able
to
retire.
that's
the
operative
effect
of
it,
not
necessarily
he
is
going
to
be
observed
more
at
all.
i
mean
in
the
navy
you're
observed
once
a
year,
no
matter
what,
on
your
fitness
reports
unless
you've
been
transferred
and
then
you
may
have
multiple
observations.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that's
right,
and
that's
exactly
right.
now
--
but
we've
must
look
at
what
congress
intended
and
we
can't
at
all
say
that
congress
did
not
--
congress
would
not
intend
the
benefit
of
the
women
not
be
applied
to
lieutenant
ballard
in
this
case.
i
mean
how
it
can
be
asserted
that
in
any
way
shape
or
form
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
in
applying
the
10
u.s.c.6401
to
lieutenant
ballard
to
cure
the
--
to
grant
the
relief
requested.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
i
never
asserted
and
didn't
mean
to
give
the
court
the
impression
that
it
was
congress's
intent
not
to
apply
6401
to
lieutenant
ballard.
in
fact,
it's
very
possible
that
congress,
in
fact
the
record
shows
that
it
was
a
congress's
intent
to
equalize
the
services
the
male
and
the
female
when
it
said
13
years
that's
conceded
by
the
government.
so
in
no
way,
shape
or
form
do
i
want
to
state
that
it
could
be
congress's
intent
not
to
give
that
benefit
because
i
mean
that's
the
relief
that
was
sought,
that's
the
relief
that
was
granted
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
congress's
intent
would
be
other
than
to
have
this
man
get
the
same
benefit
as
a
woman.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
that
was
an
executive
order
and
in
1968
and
the
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that
the
--
because
here's
the
thing
can
we
say
that
congress
would
realized
that
the
same
statute
or
that
the
suspension
of
time
and
grade
or
the
president
would
realize
that
this
suspension
of
time
and
grade
which
causes
the
rapid
promotion
would
also
push
out
a
bunch
of
well
qualified
people,
do
you
see
what
i'm
getting
at.
i
mean
that's
really
what
the
effect
is,
you
want
to
increase
the
number,
it's
a
paradox,
you
want
to
increase
the
size
of
the
military
but
at
the
same
time
because
you're
suspending
the
time
and
grade
a
whole
bunch
of
well
qualified
people
maybe
are
getting
pushed
out.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
because
it's
in
the
record
that
congress
made
13
years
in
the
women
statute
so
it
would
equal
the
male
statute.
that
was
their
reasoning.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
it
would
apply
if
in
fact,
the
department
of
defense
bill
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
if
the
other
214
were
to
join
in
this
lawsuit,
they
--
depending
on
how
many
years
they
had
been
in
the
service.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
i'm
just
saying,
your
honor,
that
we
can't
assume
that
it
would
be
the
intent
of
congress
to
deny
lieutenant
ballard
of
this
extra
three
years,
that's
the
assumption
that
we
can't
make.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
that's
a
separate
lawsuit
that
maybe
completely
decided
by
the
changing
of
the
slot.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
basically
we're
talking
about
men
who,
they
haven't
intervened
and
we're
up
to
the
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
anybody
who
was
subject
to
discharge
of
that
statute
and
if
the
statute
is
declared
unconstitutional
could
be
subject
to
that,
but
this
is
not
a
class
action
even
though
the
government
is
talking
about
it
like
it's
a
class
action.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
we
don't
attack
the
selection
out
procedure,
your
honor,
just
as
the
government
stated
we
don't
attack
that.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
but
what
if
you
inject
sex
into
that
pushing
out
of
well
qualified
people
and
that's
really
what
our
problem
is,
because
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
selection
--
the
up
or
out
selection
procedure
â€“
so
it
is
a
hard
procedure
but
i'm
not
attacking
it
here,
i
can't
really
but
if
it's
tied
to
sex
i
can
and
have
and
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
i
have
a
hard
time
with
that,
i
couldn't
find
any
intent
of
congress
to
that
effect
and
i'm
wondering
about
justifying
a
discriminatory
scheme
by
saying
that
it's
to
make
up
for
another
discrimination
and
we're
not
in
an
attack
situation
like
congress
or
shevin.
what
i
think
the
government
is
trying
to
do
there
is
to
bring
this
case
--
to
attempt
to
bring
this
case
within
a
rationale
congress
or
shevin
to
say
that
this
is
really
remedial
or
compensatory
legislation
and
the
record
doesn't
support
that.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
no
your
honor.
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
what
actually
--
what
the
government
stated
is
that
these
nine
people
that
i
mentioned
before
are
subject
--
in
mr.
ballard's
case
who
did
not
have
20
years
in
or
19
Â½
years
because
they
rounded
off
to
20,
who
do
not
have
that
period
of
the
time
in
--
they
were
kept
in
under
10
u.s.c.
1006
(e)
which
is
called
the
continuation
program
and
when
you
get
within
two
years
of
retirement
you
are
eligible
for
that
program.
now,
he
is
very,
he
is
lot
closer
than
two
years
retirement.
he
was
not
within
two
years
retirement
when
we
brought
the
lawsuit.
he
is
within
four
months
of
retirement
right
now,
and
so
i
feel
that
the
navy
under
10
u.s.c.
1006
(e)
will
go
ahead
and
retire
the
man
anyway.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is
such
a
late
suggestion
on
my
part
is
that
i
just
came
across
odegaard
and
that
logic,
and
defunis
v.
odegaard
yesterday
in
researching
this
and
i
felt
that
i
must
bring
that
up
to
the
court.
also
the
idea
of
dismissing
this
appeal
on
the
idea
of
the
fact
that
the
federal
question
hasn't
been
properly
presented,
so
much
of
what
i've
been
talking
about
here
has
been
affidavits
and
what
the
government
has
been
putting
forth
were
presented
in
affidavits
which
presented
after
the
trial
in
this
case
in
a
motion
for
new
trial.
they
have
never
been
responded
to
by
lieutenant
ballard
because
the
trial
was
over,
and
that's
not
a
proper
way
to
bring
the
federal
question
before
this
court
as
i
said
in
my
brief
and
i
did
raise
this
in
my
brief
that
the
federal
question
is
not
properly
presented.
it
would
be
best
for
the
court,
if
the
court
isn't
going
to
rule
in
favor
of
me
and
my
client
on
the
merits.
it
would
be
best
to
dismiss
the
appeal
and
have
the
question
properly
presented
or
if
again
the
court
isn't
going
to
rule
in
favor
of
my
client
on
the
merits
in
this
case
and
fine
number
one
that
there
was
a
constitutional
deprivation,
sex
discrimination
here
and
grant
the
same
relief
that
was
granted
below.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
your
honor,
the
whole
point
of
their
affidavits
is
the
pandora's
box
argument
that
i've
alluded
to
before,
namely,
words
to
the
effect
that
the
navy
is
going
to
come
it's
screeching
halt
if
the
court
implements
this
relief.
not
that
there
is
a
discrimination
but
that
the
relief
is
going
to
be
very
hard
on
the
navy
and
that's
what
i'm
contesting,
that
i've
never
had
a
chance
to
contest
by
a
way
of
interrogatory,
that
never
stood
the
test
of
trial
because
let
me
say
this,
that
there
are
actually
in
my
experience
and
here
i'm
doing
the
same
thing
that
i'm
saying
the
government
is
doing
i
don't
want
to
be
testifying
but
there
are
very
few
people
who
are
going
to
take
advantage
of
this
so
it
can't
bring
the
navy
to
his
screeching
halt.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
there
are
a
lot
of
facts
which
have
been
spoken
to
by
the
government
in
an
attempt
to
support
a
rational
basis
which
would
never
raise
before
and
that's
and
i
contest
their
accuracy.
i'm
contesting
that
even
it
is
that
they
make
a
rational
basis
and
so
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
oh!
no
your
honor,
no
that's
not
true
i
mean
because
of
the
fact
that
we
would
be,
i
would
be
able
to
tell
the
court
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it's
not
200
people
that
are
taking
advantage
of
this
lawsuit
but
maybe
20.
did
you
see
the
difference
in
that?
i
mean
their
whole
basis
is
that
this
is
causing
an
administrative
problem
with
the
navy
and
a
money
problem
with
the
navy
that's
really
what
their
whole
argument
is
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
that
meets
the
rational
basis
test
at
all.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
10
u.s.c.
6382.
did
it
precede
the
admission?
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
i
can't
answer
that,
your
honor,
and
all
that
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well,
the
scheme
is
unconstitutional
and
the
point
is
in
the
two
ways
that
we
approach
this,
the
court
below
has
the
decision
what
were
they
going
to
do,
what
relief
were
they
going
to
grant
and
then
that's
the
decision
that
they
had
to
make
is
to
try
to
figure
out
what
congress
intended.
in
other
words,
when
you
say
which
statue
i
don't
like
to
say
that
one
or
the
other
is
unconstitutional
because
for
one
thing
10
u.s.c.
6382
did
not
combine
women
in
it.
so
i
had
to
argue
that
two
statutes
in
the
same
sections
10
u.s.c.
operating
together
as
a
whole
were
unconstitutional,
does
the
court
see
what
i'm
getting
at
and
that's
what
my
arguments
was
below.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
i
think
the
chronology
would
help
in
figuring
out
what
the
intent
of
congress
is
your
honor
and
that's
what
the
court
has
to
do
when
they're
granting
relief.
in
other
words,
we
can
conclude
on
the
merits
that
there
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination.
the
question
is
what
to
do
about
it
and
the
court
below
took
the
action
that
they
did
and
i'm
talking
about
the
fact
here
now
that
there
is
ample
justification
to
support
their
assumption
that
this
is
what
congress
would
do.
now,
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
because
of
the
fact
that
at
the
time
the
lawsuit
was
filed
he
did
not
come
within
the
relief
established
in
this
and
i'm
referring,
let
me
just
refer
the
court
specifically
to
the
brief
and
the
government
alluded
to
it
in
the
oral
argument
but
basically
in
the
government's
brief
at
page
5,
footnote
6,
there
is
a
statement
about
this
long
standing
policy
of
the
navy
to
retire
individuals
when
they've
gotten
within
two
years
of
retirement
and
then
there's
a
forbes's
affidavit
which
is
in
appendix
9
(a)
and
then
there's
also
an
affidavit
which
is
not
in
the
appendix
but
which
is
in
the
record
of
this
case
which
was
filed
by
the
government
which
stated
that
yes
in
fact,
the
navy
does
have
this
long
standing
policy
to
retire
individuals
when
they
get
within
two
years
of
retirement
and
it's
supported
by
statute
and
that's
what
i
cited
the
statute
10
u.s.c
1006
e
and
that
he
is
now
within
that
and
itâ€˜s
my
understanding
that
he
is
going
to
be
retired
on
that,
that
they
really
--
based
on
the
navy's
long
standing
policy
what
is
there
to
exempt
him
from
that
long
standing.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
february
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
let
me
state
what
that
situation
is.
it
is
the
long
standing
policy
all
nine
of
the
officers
who
were
in
lieutenant
ballads
class
and
this
group
of
people,
who
were
two
years
--
within
two
years
they
were
all
retired,
in
the
new
bill
that
becomes
mandatory,
let
me
say
something
further,
that
in
the
new
bill
that
the
government
was
talking
about,
he
has
no
problem.
none
of
this
people
have
any
problem
in
this
new
bill
they
all
have
equity,
they
get
large
equity
payments
--
a
lot
of
this
is
taken
care
of
but
it's
true
your
honor,
it's
this
10
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
that's
right
in
other
words
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
you
resign
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
exactly.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
oh!
well
it
will
just
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
as
a
practical
--
yes
your
honor,
as
a
practical
matter
he
will
be
able
to
stay
until
retirement
which
his
retirement
is,
well
his
retirement
actually
even
if
he
stays
in
until
february
16,
1975
that's
retirement
that's
19
Â½
years,
you
mean
in
19
Â½
years
february
16th
1975.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
very
close
to
it.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
very
--
it
will
be
very
close
to
it
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
well
your
honor,
i
was
in
dismissing
i'm
talking
about
that
in
the
context
of
dismissing
the
appeal.
i
felt
that
the
court
would
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
grounds
of
number
one;
if
for
example,
it
was
improperly
presented
federal
question.
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
may
i
suggest
something
to
the
court
then,
because
this
is
a
very
important
point
and
i'm
only
raising
for
the
first
time.
i
would
like
to
submit
refund.
additional
refund
is
issued
because
it
is
so
important
and
obviously
i
don't
want
any
way,
shape
or
form
to
be
asking
the
court
to
do
something
that
will
undercut
the
victory
that
was
one
below
and
so
i
would
ask
to
be
able
to
--
mr.
charles
r.
khoury,
jr.
the
court
puts
me
in
a
tough
position,
i
don't
see
how
--
if
the
--
if
my
client
is
going
to
be
--
is
to
get
this
retirement
which
is
--
which
was
really
the
ultimate
of
the
lawsuit,
i
don't
see
how
i
could
object.
thank
you.
