justice
thurgood
marshall
why
isn't
the
up
and
out
rule
good
for
the
women?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
isn't
out
rule
good
for
women
as
you
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
it
doesn't
apply
to
the
women.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
have
to
say
this
is
a
very
good
rule
for
the
men?
but
why
isn't
it
“s
a
good
rule
for
woman”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
disadvantage
is
brought
about
by
the
navy,
the
same
group
that
brought
up
or
out
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
same
thing.
you
can't
separate
the
navy
from
--
congress
controls
the
navy.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
couldn't
you
put
that
out,
why
is
this
up
or
out
rule
on
women?
justice
thurgood
marshall
congress
doesn't
prohibit
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
order
to
conform
the
congress,
why
didn't
you
say
that
“its
the
navy
people
who
are
sent
to
sea
duty
shall
up
or
out”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
instead
of
making
it
male
to
female.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
think
--
couldn't
the
navy
say
that
all
people
subject
to
sea
duty
shall
either
qualify
twice
or
get
out--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
think
the
navy
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
the
navy
has
said
it,
so
far
the
women
are
concerned.
i
think
i'm
arguing
just
as
they
get
out
of
the
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
nothing
the
navy
could
do
to
get
around
that
that's
the
one
point
i
am
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
only
way
that
we
correct
it
is
to
go
against
the
statute
itself?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
explain
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
ms.
shapiro,
i
think
you've
covered
it,
but
your
figures
on
the
women
includes
the
medical
and
the
nurse
school?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
the
medical
core?
justice
thurgood
marshall
since
you
want
to
talk
about
figures,
what's
your
basis
of
nine
based
on
the
number,
total
number
of
years
he
was
in
the
navy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
total
number
of
years
that
he
was
a
lieutenant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
the
issue
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
how
lieutenants
did
they
have
that
it
never
been
an
enlisted
man.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
wrong
with
that
figure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
only
talks
about
those,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
statute
talks
about
enlisted
people?
justice
thurgood
marshall
people
that
have
enlisted
services,
they
don't
talk
about
that,
the
statute
you're
talking
about
talks
about
lieutenants?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
is
somewhere
in
the
statute
or
where
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
tell
me
i
don't
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
many
in
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
1it's
awful
large
person.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
take
care
of
this
one
without
taking
care
of
it
yet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
lower
court
take
care
of
one
or
all.
did
the
lower
court
go
after
the
whole
study.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
that
affects
how
many
people.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i'm
still
worried
about
your
statement
that
this
one
man
lieutenant
ballard,
congress
meant
to
give
him
the
same
relief
he
gave
women.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
that
apply
to
the
other
200
to
be
in
the
same
category
as
lieutenant
ballard?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
other
214
join
in
this
lawsuit
would
it
apply
to
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
is
there
in
the
congressional
history
that
limited
to
the
number
of
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
can't
speak
of
lieutenant
ballard
but
i
still
think
of
those
other
200
in
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
know
there's
separate
lawsuit.
i
thought
you
said
they
get
in
to
being
in
this
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
of
course,
(inaudible)
so
all
200
and
some
of
them
are
now
in
the
same
category
as
women
according
to
you
--
justice
thurgood

why
