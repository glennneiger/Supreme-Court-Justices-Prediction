justice

stewart
when
you're
talking
about
officers,
you're
talking
about
lieutenants
or
?
justice
potter
stewart
lieutenants.
justice
potter
stewart
navy
lieutenant?
justice
potter
stewart
incidentally
is
the
ratio
of
female
lieutenants
to
female
lieutenant
commanders
about
the
same
as
male
to
male
in
both
of
the
categories?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
the
ratio?
justice
potter
stewart
even
though
they
had
been
passed
over
--
justice
potter
stewart
their
promotion
twice.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
you
say
in
peacetime,
they
too
would
have
stayed
on
for
almost
13
years?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
would
have
been
the
predicted
average?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
not
the
statutory
about
that
and
it
was
just
the
predicted
average
time.
justice
potter
stewart
oh
actually,
is
that
the
statute
that
has
been
suspended
by
the
executive
order?
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
have
a
relation
to
this
process?
justice
potter
stewart
how
could
a
lieutenant
is
so
close
to
retiring?
probably
he
would
have
been
a
mustang
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
a
listed
service.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
statutory
limitation
now
on
the
promotions
for
the
women
in
the
navy,
used
to
be
back
generation
ago
for
example,
(inaudible)
ways
was
a
captain,
he
didn't
have
the
flag
rank
and
that
was
a
matter
of
statute.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
of
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
the
highest
rank
to
which
a
woman
could
achieve
in
the
navy
was
captain.
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
no
limitations?
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
sex
limitations?
justice
potter
stewart
limitations
on
the
overall
member
of
flag
hoisters
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
nurse
core,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
and
are
there
now
men
in
the
naval
nurse
core?
justice
potter
stewart
commission
officers?
justice
potter
stewart
commissioned
officer
nurse
in?
justice
potter
stewart
the
new
navy?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
years
will
he
need
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
he
will
have.
justice
potter
stewart
mrs.
shapiro,
tells
tells
us
the
statute
is
going
to
be
repealed,
you
tell
us
he
gets
everything
he
wants,
but
what
are
we
dealing
with?
justice
potter
stewart
being
a
man
it's
not
a
tax
case.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
kahn
v.
shevin
was.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
florida
tax
case
either
which
is
what
that
was.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
not
valued
that
i
have
been
promoted.
is
that
the
answer?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
is
this
accurate
in
the
government's
supply
brief?
that,
that
suspension
was
made
because
suspension
of
normal
time
and
grade
provisions
was
of
these
officers
was
acquired
in
times
of
national
emergency,
and
this
executive
order
suspended
them
as
in
a
time
of
national
emergency,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
khoury,
getting
back
from
this
february
date
when
he
would
be
eligible
for
retirement,
have
you
had
any
assurances
from
the
navy
without
the
guards
and
the
outcome
of
this
case,
that
he
will
be
kept
out
until
he
is
eligible?
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
the
judgment
flows
reverse?
justice
potter
stewart
on
that
basis
that
you're
suggesting
this
case
might
be
moot
and
dismissed?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
is
now
within
about
five
months
or
so.
justice
potter
stewart
whatever
that
is
next
january?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
the
policy
involved
is
the
reserved
appointment
according
to
that
but--
justice
potter
stewart
your
thought
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
at
this
junction
however
this
case
comes
out,
he
would
probably
get
a
reserved
appointment
so
that
it
could
retire
in
february.
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
have
one
other
question.
if
he
gets
the
reserved
appointment
will
that
entitle
him
to
stay
in
a
total
of
13
years
after
having
--
justice
potter
stewart
will
that
equalize
him
with
the
woman
--
who
have
all
the
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
still
doesn't
give
him
what
a
woman
would
have,
i
take
it,
does
it,
13
years
as
a
lieutenant?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
lieutenant.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
different
from
a
dismissal
and
the
appeal
is
properly
broad.
the
judgment
in
the
latter
case
stands
but
in
the
former
a
dismissal
is
moot
--
vacation.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
the
government
were
to
say
to
us
today
we're
doing
the
apply
this
policy
put
him
on
a
reserve
appointment
status
so
that
then
he
can
be
retired
in
february.
would
you
still
object
to
a
vacation
and
dismissal
of
the
action
as
moot?
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
other?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
about
--
is
it
true
that
as
your
--instances
like
this,
if
within
two
years
of
retirement
as
he
now
is,
--
your
plot
park
probably
practice
where
they
have
to
do
it
or
not
is
to
give
them
a
reserve
appointment
and
let
them
finish
out
the
term.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
if
there
is
an
affirmance,
then
what's
your
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
--
if
the
injunction
remained,
you
can't
discharge
him.
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
february
he
may
retire.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
can't
even
discharge
him
in
february.
you
have
to
hold
him
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
prior
to
the
expiration,
you
can't
just
discharge
him
prior
to
expiration
of
13
years
of
commission
service.
justice
potter
stewart
making
him
the
same
equivalent
as
though
he
were
a
female.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
suppose
if
it
were
reputed,
you'd
go
back
to
district
court
and
tell
him
so
and
let
them
decide
in
the
first
instance
for
what
happens.
we
wouldn't
decide
that
on
a

justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
appellee,
robert
c.
ballard
is
a
lieutenant
in
the
united
states
navy.
after
more
than
nine
years
of
active
service
as
a
commissioned
officer,
the
failed
for
a
second
time
to
be
selected
for
promotion
to
the
grade
of
lieutenant
commander
and
he
was
therefore
subject
to
mandatory
discharge
under
the
governing
federal
statute.
he
brought
suit
in
a
federal
court
claiming
that
if
he
had
been
a
woman
officer,
he
would
have
been
subject
to
a
different
separation
statute
under
which
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
13
years
of
commission
service
before
a
mandatory
discharge
for
want
of
promotion.
he
claimed
that
the
application
of
the
governing
statute
to
him,
when
compared
with
the
treatment
of
women
officers
subject
to
the
other
statute
applicable
to
them,
was
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
based
on
sex
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
three-judge
district
court
agreed
with
his
contentions
and
enjoined
his
discharge
from
the
navy
before
the
expiration
of
13
years
of
commissioned
service.
the
government
thereupon
brought
this
appeal
from
that
judgment.
this
court
has
recognized
that
it
is
the
primary
business
of
armies
and
navies
to
fight
or
to
be
ready
to
fight
should
the
occasion
arise
and
that's
a
direct
quotation
from
the
case
of
toth
against
quarles.
under
the
constitution,
the
responsibility
for
determining
how
best
our
armed
forces
shall
attend
to
that
business
rests
with
the
congress
and
with
the
president.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
detail
in
the
written
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
in
exercising
its
broad
constitutional
power,
congress
has
not
violated
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
case.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
separate
dissenting
statement
expressing
his
substantial
agreement
with
mr.
justice
brennan's
dissenting
opinion.
