justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
shapiro,
when
the
13
year
statute
was
first
enacted
was
it
at
that
time
fairly
close
to
the
length
of
time
that
a
man
had
to
go
to
be
passed
over
twice?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
basis
that
court
had
followed
in
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
the
custom
changed
with
respect
to
men
mr.
khoury,
i
take
it,
it
hasn't
been
a
result
of
statute
but
simply
it's
a
result
of
practice
that
gradually
the
period
for
men
has
gone
down
from
13
years.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
of
course,
in
the
second
world
war
you
had
21-year-old
colonels.
they
did
away
with
all
sorts
of
time
and
grades.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
he
does
in
fact
suspend,
so
that
you
don't
have
to
spend
as
much
time
and
grade,
doesn't
it
follow
as
a
natural
consequence
of
that,
that
the
opportunity
to
judge
the
man
may
come
up
more
frequently?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
your
chance
to
be
promoted
from
lieutenant
would
come
at
the
sooner
date
by
reason
of
the
executive
order.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
right
the
court
below
was
wrong
if
congress
wouldn't
have
intended
this
to
apply
to
lieutenant
ballard
they
should
have
enforced
the
congressional
intent
and
not
declared
as
statute
unconstitutional.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
on
earth
do
they
have
to
declare
a
statute
unconstitutional.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
wouldn't
they
just
told
the
executive
order
was
inconsistent
with
this
intent
of
congress
that
you
described.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
rational
basis
applies
mr.
khoury,
does
it
make
much
difference
whether
the
arguments
are
put
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
by
an
admiral
or
whether
they
are
put
in
the
form
of
an
attorney's
brief
saying
rational
people
could
argue
that
such
and
such
would
serve
a
purpose,
i
mean
one
way
you're
confronted
with
that
as
a
statement
of
fact,
and
other
way
your
confronted
with
a
legal
argument
but
it's
pretty
much
the
same
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
really
the
way
we're
trying
constitutional
cases
now.
what
i'm
saying
is
addressed
perhaps
more
to
the
government
than
to
you
that
instead
of
making
arguments
as
lawyers
as
to
supporting
justifications,
you
take
people's
depositions
and
put
them
on
the
witness
stand
to
see
what
they
were
thinking
when
they
promulgated
a
particular
right
of
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
just
as
able
to
make
that
argument
now
having
seen
the
affidavit
as
you
would
be
had
just
seen
it
in
our
opposing
brief.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
meet
the
rational
basis
test?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
khoury,
i
believe
our
practice
in
cases
where
we
find
the
case
is
moot
is
to
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
direct
the
action
be
dismissed
so
that
you
would
in
effect
lose
the
benefit
of
your
district
court
judgment
whereas
i
understand
it,
we
concluded
it
as
it
is
moot,
is
that
agreeable
to
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
a
case
is
moot
though
under
our
(inaudible)
case
we
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
directed
the
action
be
dismissed.
