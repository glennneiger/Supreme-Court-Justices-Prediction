justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wallace,
i
think
you
disagree
with
my
brother's
stewart's
that
this
is
a
free
press
not
free
speech?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
reason
i
asked
you
is
because
326
as
i
read
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
wording
of
326
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
nothing
about
it,
isn't
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
326
right
of
free
speech
includes
free
questions?
can
326
be
involved
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
reads
more
like
a
free
press,
emphasis
on
(inaudible)
and
then
it
does
involve
free
speech?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
there
must
be
that
at
least
you
thought
that
right
of
free
speech,
326
raises
also
the
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
getting
back,
mr.
skillman,
are
you
suggesting
that
there's
no
legal
lotteries
when
this
was
--
the
statute
was
adopted?
are
you
also
arguing
that
--
in
that
light
as
to
the
statute
is
not
including
illegal
lotteries
in
order
to
avoid
reaching
the
first
amendment
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
reason
i
asked,
i
notice
that
your
brief
at
page
12
has
a
sentence
accordingly
section
1304
should
be
construed
so
as
to
avoid
these
substantial
constitutional
policy,
citing
machinist
and
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
know
but
we
could
constitute
1304
as
not
including
legal
lotteries,
obviously
we
wouldn't
have
to
reach
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
though
there's
the
information
concerning
any
lottery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wallace,
what
about
the
interview
with
the
millionaire
winner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
is
information
concerning
a
lottery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what's
the
distinction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
i'm
asking,
i
can't
imagine
a
better
promotion
than
interviewing
someone
who's
won
a
million
dollars?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
bet
you
know
a
lot
of
people
run
out
and
buy
them
in
consequence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
filed
a
per
curiam
opinion
in
this
case
for
reasons
stated
in
that
opinion.
the
judgment
for
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
vacated
and
remanded
so
that
it
may
consider
whether
the
case
is
now
moot
in
light
of
a
recent
amendment
to
the
federal
statute
involved.
mr.
justice
douglas
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
chief
justice
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
the
decision
of
the
case.
