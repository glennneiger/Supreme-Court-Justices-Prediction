generally,
does
the
department
feels
that
something
will
be
forthcoming?

mr.
skillman,
i
think
i
am
bothered
a
little
too
because
i
sense
from
your
remarks
that
the
public
interest
is
a
definite
factor
in
news,
information
becomes
news
because
there
is
public
interest
in
it,
i
think
this
is
what
you're
sayin.
what
if
the
lady's
aid
society
of
some
church
in
cape
may
in
new
jersey
had
a
raffle
and
there
was
intense
interests
in
cape
may
but
nowhere
else
in
the
state
of
new
jersey,
would
this
mean
news
as
you
regarded
and
broadcastable?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
ask
one
more
question,
while
i
have
you
interrupted.
do
you
distinguish
between
broadcasting
the
names
of
winners
as
was
the
case
in
the
second
circuit
case
and
broadcasting
the
numbers
as
is
the
third
circuit
situation?
