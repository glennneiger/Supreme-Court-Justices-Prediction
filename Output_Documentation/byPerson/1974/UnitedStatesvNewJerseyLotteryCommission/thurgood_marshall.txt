justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn't
this
statute
aimed
at
illegal
lotteries?
i
know,
it
didn't
say
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
doesn't
go
because
it's
gambling,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what's
striking
as
funny
is
that
you
can't
broadcast
result
of
the
lottery,
but
you
can
broadcast
the
result
of
a
horse
race,
including
the
odds?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
commission
doesn't
propose
anything
beyond
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
anybody
would
listen
to
horse
race
results
who
didn't
bet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
do?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
congress
could
do
it,
the
point
is
that
congress
has
singled
out
lottery?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
represent
the
state
of
new
jersey,
don't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
doesn't
the
state
have
a
commercial
interest
in
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wallace,
you
can
have
the
story
and
the
pictures
of
all
the
men
winning
the
million
dollars,
that's
okay.
could
you
not
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you
announce
the
number
of
the
winning
ticket
on
that
program?
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
commission
you
said
that
you
can't
announce
the
number?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
can
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
is
more
encouraging
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
before
this,
that
encourages
lottery
play
and
more
so
then
tell
somebody
that
they
won?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
could
then
say
the
government
said
this?
