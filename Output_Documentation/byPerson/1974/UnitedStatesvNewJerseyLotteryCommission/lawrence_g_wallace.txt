mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arose
on
a
petition
by
jersey
cape
broadcasting
corporation,
a
broadcast
licensee
in
new
jersey,
seeking
a
declaratory
ruling
from
the
federal
communications
commission.
jersey
cape
pointed
out
to
the
commission
that
the
winning
number
in
the
new
jersey
state
lottery
is
selected
every
thursday
and
that
many
of
the
listeners
to
the
broadcast
station
were
interested
in
learning
what
the
winning
number
was
and
many
of
them
knew
that
the
broadcast
stations
were
informed
of
that
number
on
their
wire
service
and
were
telephoning
the
station
to
ascertain
the
number.
the
jersey
cape
wanted
to
know
the
commission's
opinion
on
whether
it's
proposal
to
broadcast
on
three
successive
newscasts,
each
thursday,
the
statement
that
the
winning
state
lottery
number
drawn
today
is
and
they
recite
the
number,
whether
that
would
violate
section
1304
of
title
18
of
the
united
states
code.
that
provision
is
set
forth
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
2
and
it
provides
summarizing
the
pertinent
language,
whoever
broadcasts
or
skipping
down,
knowingly
permits
the
broadcasting
of
any
advertisement
of
or
information
concerning
any
lottery,
skipping
down
three
lines,
or
any
list
of
the
prizes
drawn
or
awarded
by
means
of
any
such
lottery,
skipping,
whether
said
list
contains
any
part
or
all
of
such
prizes
shall
be
fined
not
more
than
$1,000.00
or
imprison
not
more
than
one
year
or
both.
the
commission
in
response
to
this
request
issued
a
declaratory
ruling
stating
that
in
its
view,
this
broadcast,
the
proposal
would
violate
section
1304
of
title
18.
it
based
this
view
on
an
interpretation
of
this
provision
that
had
been
developed
in
a
decision
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
1969,
called
new
york
state
broadcasters
and
on
the
commission's
further
proceedings
on
remand
in
that
case
which
was
also
a
case
involving
a
declaratory
ruling.
in
that
case,
the
second
circuit
and
the
commission
had
both
held
that
the
statute
applies
to
legal
as
well
as
illegal
lotteries
and
applies
to
not
only
to
advertisements,
but
also
to
information
directly
promoting
a
legal
or
illegal
lottery.
the
interpretation
limiting
the
words
information
concerning
any
lottery
was
based
in
part
on
the
face
of
the
statute
itself,
which
goes
on
to
specify
or
any
list
of
the
prizes
drawn
or
awarded
which
would
have
been
surplusage
if
congress
had
intended
to
use
the
word
information
as
comprehensively
as
possible
and
i
might
add
that
the
interpretation
also
could
quite
properly
be
based
on
the
fact
that
at
the
same
time
that
this
provision
was
enacted,
congress
reenacted
the
47
u.s.c.
326,
which
is
also
set
forth
on
page
2,
guaranteeing
broadcast
licensees
the
right
of
free
speech
and
protection
from
censorship
by
the
commission.
the
commission
held
with
respect
to
this
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
mr.
justice
that
the
question
was
addressed
by
the
second
circuit
and
by
the
commission
and
we've
discussed
it
in
our
brief.
the
history
of
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
this
particular
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
statute,
but
this
statute
is
one
in
the
series
of
anti-lottery
statutes
that
congress
enacted
foreclosing
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
and
the
channels
of
communication
regulated
by
congress
to
the
promotion
of
lotteries
including
the
use
of
the
mails.
the
--
those
statutes
go
back
to
1827.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
19th
century
statutes
were
enacted
at
a
time
when
there
were
legally
authorized
lotteries
in
the
united
states.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
it's
true
under
the
commission's
ruling.
the
only
statutory
bar
that
congress
has
enacted
is
on
lotteries
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
commission
does
not.
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
reporting
race
results
and
reporting
a
lottery
number
because
the
lottery
number
as
the
commission
pointed
out
has
no
meaning
to
the
general
listener
who
is
not
holding
a
lottery
ticket.
it
conveys
nothing
to
the
audience
other
than
whether
those
holding
a
ticket
are
holding
a
winning
ticket
or
not,
unlike
the
results
of
the
sports
contest
or
a
race
or
market
quotations
or
other
kinds
of
broadcast
where
people
are
interested
in
the
market,
in
the
racing
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
know
people
attend
races
and
don't
bet.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
have
done
so.[attempt
to
laughter]
those
people
may
not
be
the
most
expert
on
what's
happening
in
the
races,
but
it
certainly
is
true
that
race
results
can
be
of
interest
to
people
who
are
following
the
sport,
regardless
of
whether
they've
bet
on
the
particular
race
or
whether
they
bet
on
any
race.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
singled
out
lotteries.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
it
deliberately
did
so
in
the
course
of
the
development
of
this
legislation
in
the
19th
century.
we
recounted
the
history
in
our
brief.
at
that
time
that
the
word
illegal
was
removed
from
some
of
these
prohibitions.
in
1876,
there
was
a
debate
specifically
on
this
point.
there
were
some
who
advocated
restricting
the
statutory
prohibition
only
to
illegal
lotteries
and
thought
that
the
function
was
to
aid
the
states
in
their
enforcement
of
the
law
against
lotteries,
but
the
prevailing
view
was
no
that
lotteries
themselves
are
an
evil
even
when
authorized
by
state
law
as
the
louisiana
lottery
was
until
from
almost
20
years
later
in
1893,
and
that
the
channels
or
the
use
of
the
mails
should
be
forbidden
to
lotteries.
now,
in
1934,
when
this
provision
was
enacted,
there
weren't
any
legal
lotteries
in
the
united
states,
although
there
were
legal
lotteries
elsewhere,
being
conducted
elsewhere
for
which
tickets
were
sometimes
attempted
to
be
sold
in
the
united
states,
and
the
predominant
purpose
shown
in
adopting
this
prohibition
for
broadcasters
was
to
put
them
in
the
same
position
as
publishers
of
newspapers
or
of
circulars
who
were
forbidden
to
use
the
mails
for
this
purpose.
and
congress
drew
no
distinction
on
the
face
of
the
statute
between
legal
or
illegal
lottery
and
there
is
no
reason
to
read
one
in.
the
predominant
intent
was
to
apply
the
law
as
it
had
been
developed
with
respect
to
the
other
lottery
prohibitions
and
this
court
held
in
the
rapier
case
in
volume
146
us
and
in
the
fabrizio
case
in
volume
385
us
that
some
of
the
other
prohibitions
do
apply
to
legal
as
well
as
illegal
lotteries.
as
the
second
circuit
put
it,
congress
had
long
since
stopped
distinguishing
between
legal
and
illegal
lotteries
in
the
lottery
legislation.
now,
there
have
been
since
the
more
recent
development
of
official
state
lotteries,
there
have
been
efforts
in
congress
to
amend
the
statute
to
make
an
exception
for
broadcast
concerning
the
--
well,
the
attorney
general
testified
today
in
support
of
an
amendment,
which
would
in
effect
moot
out
this
case
since
this
case
is
merely
a
declaratory
ruling,
it's
still
in
committee
and
we
will
keep
the
court
advised
in
any
developments.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
testimony
was
in
the
senate
today.
previously
a
house
subcommittee
had
reported
favorably.
there
is
controversy
in
congress.
there
are
some
difference
of
opinion
about
what
form
the
amendment
should
take,
whether
it
should
apply
to
state
authorized
lotteries
or
only
the
state
run
lotteries.
the
department
taking
the
position
that
you
apply
only
to
state-run
the
lotteries
and
there
some
other
questions
to
be
ironed
out,
let
alone
the
ultimate
question
of
whether
it
will
be
enacted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
expectation.
the
department
is
proposing
that
congress
act
and
the
federal
communications
commission
is
deferring
to
the
department
of
justice
on
what
congress
should
do
in
this
area.
and
it
has
consulted
closely
with
the
department
of
justice
in
its
administration
of
the
statute
to
the
extent
it's
--
had
occasion
to
administer
it
and
mostly
in
just
the
declaratory
rulings
that
it
comes
to
the
court's
attention.
now,
not
only
it
seems
to
us
and
the
third
circuit
did
not
disagree
on
the
legal
--
illegal
aspect,
no
basis
for
--
well,
perhaps
i
should
stop
and
tell
the
court
what
the
third
circuit
did
hold
in
this
case
after
the
commission
pointed
out
that
in
its
view
the
purpose
of
--
or
the
function
of
such
a
broadcast
would
be
to
help
in
conducting
the
lottery
and
the
number
would
be
of
interest
only
to
the
limited
class
of
persons
holding
lottery
tickets
and
would
serve
only
that
function.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
at
some
two
and
three
quarter
million
persons,
this
in
an
atypical
first
amendment
case
in
that
regard
mr.
justice.
it's
usually
a
minority
interest
of
some
kind
that
is
seeking
protection
from
the
courts
against
legislation
in
the
first
amendment
case.
we
concede
however
that
the
majority
is
also
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
it
is
put
in
those
terms.
there
is
a
first
amendment
claim
here
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
broadcaster
is
not
in
this
court,
only
the
new
jersey
state
lottery
commission
is
in
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
went
to
the
commission
and
after
the
commission's
ruling,
the
new
jersey
state
lottery
commission
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
petitioned
for
rehearing
saying
it
was
agreed
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
by
the
ruling.
the
broadcaster
did
not
seek
rehearing
nor
did
the
broadcaster
seek
review
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
the
state
lottery
commission
who
pointed
out
the
large
numbers
of
people
who
are
entrusted
and
the
commission's
response
was
this
and
they
also
pointed
out
that
they
had
no
way
of
knowing
who
had
what
number.
they
had
no
record
of
who
won
the
lottery
and
it
was
important
for
them
to
disseminate
the
number
to
the
ticket
holder
in
order
to
consummate
the
lottery
and
the
commission
said,
this
just
reconfirms
our
view
that
the
function
of
this
is
--
it's
an
ingredient
of
the
lottery
rather
than
the
kind
of
discussion
or
a
commentary
upon
the
lottery
or
documentary
that
is
not
prescribed
by
section
1304.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
said
it
can
be
termed
that,
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
did
mr.
justice
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
free
speech.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
our
view
of
326
is
that
except
for
procedural
limitations
on
the
ability
of
the
commission
to
issue
restraining
orders
by
way
of
censorship
and
not
that
as
not
involved
here.
the
commission
issued
no
restraining
order
of
any
kind
that
it
provides
for
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment.
now,
it's
specifies
only
right
of
free
speech,
but
it
doesn't
really
matter
since
the
first
amendment
protects
the
freedom
of
the
press,
whether
326
reiterates
that
or
not.
so,
we
haven't
taken
a
position
on
it,
it
seems
immaterial.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
seems
to
be
the
implication
that
it
was
a
unanimous
opinion
for
the
court
en
banc
and
in
the
first
place,
the
opinion
draws
no
distinction
between
legal
or
illegal
lotteries.
it
doesn't
question
the
commission's
holding
that
the
statute
applies
to
legal
lotteries
and
its
rationale
would
seem
to
apply
to
a
newscast
announcement
of
the
winning
number
of
an
illegal
lottery
as
much
as
it
applies
here.
its
rationale
is
based
entirely
on
the
fact
that
this
is
considered
news
by
the
licensee
and
he
wants
to
announce
it
on
his
newscast
and
that's
an
exercise
of
protected
broadcast
journalism
in
the
court's
view,
which
the
implication
is
that
first
amendment
wouldn't
allow
congress
to
interfere
with
and
then
the
court
proceeded
to
interpret
the
statute
as
not
reaching
it.
and
by
holding
that
the
statute
applies
only
to
--
well,
i
hesitate
to
say
only
to
advertisements,
only
to
promotions
as
they
put
it,
at
the
bottom
of
page
10
of
our
brief,
we
have
the
relevant
excerpt
restricting
the
application
to
promotion
of
lotteries
for
which
the
licensee
receives
compensation.
whether
that
would
include
a
sponsored
newscast
isn't
made
entirely
clear
but
presumably
it
would
not,
that
would
be
protected
if
the
sponsor
of
the
newscast
with
the
new
jersey
state
lottery
commission,
i
don't
know
what
the
third
circuit's
view
would
be.
but
that
is
the
line
drawn
and
perhaps
it
would
be
a
line
drawn
between
a
newscast
sponsored
by
the
new
jersey
state
lottery
commission,
which
is
known
to
announce
this
winning
number
each
thursday
or
an
announcement
sponsored
by
the
new
jersey
state
lottery
commission
of
the
winning
number
each
thursday.
if
so,
it
doesn't
seem
like
a
very
persuasive
line
to
us
if
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
have
this
announcement
made
and
the
licensee
is
willing
to
sell
the
time
to
the
new
jersey
state
lottery
commission,
why
doesn't
the
new
jersey
state
lottery
commission
have
the
right
to
make
it
and
as
the
new
jersey
state
lottery
commission
exercising
her
right
of
freedom
of
the
press
in
that
situation.
the
implications
of
new
york
times
against
sullivan
would
be
that
an
advertiser
is
speaking
as
a
part
of
the
press
when
he
publishes
an
editorial
advertisement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
there
could
be
a
debate
about
whether
when
the
commission
licenses
someone,
the
commission
is
thereby
giving
him
a
right
that
someone
else
sold
broadcast
time
by
the
licensee
does
not
have
under
the
first
amendment.
we
think
not
at
least
in
the
context
of
this
case.
as
we
see
the
case,
it
does
involve
basically
a
constitutional
issue
since
there
congress
deliberately
chose
to
say
or
information
as
well
as
advertisements
and
its
only
under
the
constraint
of
the
constitutional
holding
that
a
court
would
be
justified
in
effect
striking
that
language
from
the
statute
and
we
get
our
law
basically
on
this
subject
from
the
two
recent
decisions
which
we
think
are
the
closest
in
point,
one
the
capital
broadcasting
case
in
which
this
court
in
a
summary
affirmance
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
statutory
bar
of
cigarette
advertising
on
the
airwaves.
and
the
other
the
pittsburgh
press
case,
there
both
the
holding
in
the
opinion
dealing
with
limitations
that
can
be
imposed
on
certain
kinds
of
advertising
or
which
we
take
also
apply
to
promotional
announcements
that
would
not
be
compensated.
the
examples
given
in
the
pittsburgh
press
case
where
that
the
court
had
and
no
doubt
that
there
could
be
a
ban
want
ads
proposing
the
sale
of
narcotics
or
soliciting
prostitutes.
i
take
it
to
this
would
be
true
whether
the
want
ad
where
run
as
a
public
service
or
whether
it
was
paid
for
by
the
sponsor
or
whether
it
was
the
newspaper
publisher
itself
that
was
selling
the
narcotics
and
ran
announcement
of
where
they
could
be
purchased
from
the
newspaper
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
the
basic
principle
that
governs
here.
this
is
not
constituted
of
the
participation
in
a
lottery,
is
not
a
constitutionally
protected
activity.
it's
an
activity
that
can
be
suppressed
by
the
proper
government.
in
this
case,
some
states
have
seen
fit
to
authorize
lotteries
run
by
those
states
but
it
is
still
congress
that
has
the
authority
to
decide
what
uses
are
impermissible
over
the
airwaves.
if
it
has
decided
that
promoting
the
sale
of
cigarettes
or
promoting
the
sale
of
lottery
tickets
is
a
use
to
which
the
airwaves
should
not
be
put,
this
is
within
the
constitutional
power
of
congress,
so
long
as
it
doesn't
impinge
upon
the
right
fully
to
discuss
debate
and
inform
the
public
about
the
conduct
of
the
affairs
of
such
an
enterprise.
and
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
to
be
an
extreme
example
of
an
application
of
the
statute
which
does
not
cut
off
any
information
to
the
public
because
the
numbers
mean
nothing
outside
of
the
context
of
their
role
in
consummating
the
lottery.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
alright.
let
me
first
say
that
the
department
of
justice's
view
is
not
that
newspapers
listing
winning
numbers
can
be
mailed
without
violating
1302
and
our
understanding
is
that
most
newspapers
leave
the
winning
numbers
out
of
their
mail
editions
that's
why
they're
often
printed
in
a
little
box
by
themselves.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
not
barred
by
1304
under
the
commission's
view
spelled
out
under
remand
in
the
new
york
state
broadcasters
and
that's
on
page
849
of
21
fcc
ii,
paragraph
11
deals
with
interviews,
with
persons
holding
winning
lottery
tickets,
relating
among
other
matters
of
general
interests
of
the
number
of
tickets
they
purchased,
their
expectation
of
winning
a
prize,
their
reaction
upon
learning
that
they
held
winning
tickets
and
what
they
did
or
intend
to
do
with
the
prize
money.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
on
page
849
of
21
fcc
ii.
the
whole
opinion
on
remand,
it
starts
at
846
in
which
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
commission
in
the
second
circuit
said
that
the
word
information
has
to
be
interpreted
narrowly
to
apply
only
to
information
directly
promoting
a
lottery
and
not
to
interview
his
commentary
documentary
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
not
hawking.
it's
not
telling
people
where
to
buy
lottery
tickets
and
urging
them
to
do
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
same
thing,
people
might
be
encouraged
to
buy
tickets
by
a
news
program
about
aid
to
education
that
has
resulted
from
lottery
receipts
and
so
forth
but
these
are
all
considered
matters
of
legitimate
news
interests
that
are
not
primarily
promotions
of
the
lottery.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
that
congress
has
the
power
to
deny
the
use
of
the
mails
or
of
the
broadcast
media
to
promote
activities
that
congress
believes
are
injurious
to
the
public
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
--
thought
that
was
a
much
of
what
holding
was
in
the
capital
broadcasting
case
with
regard
to
cigarette
advertising.
if
the
exact
same
jingles
or
testimonials
were
repeated
voluntarily
by
the
broadcaster
on
something
they
called
newscast,
i
don't
see
the
constitutional
difference.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
commission's
--
that
is
the
commission's
interpretation
of
1304.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
commission
hasn't
spoken
to
that.
it
would
be
more
difficult.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
commission
has
--
yes,
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
the
commission
dealt
within
this
case
is
a
proposal
that
the
number
be
announced
weekly
at
the
time
of
the
drawing
on
a
newscast
so
that
someone
buying
a
lottery
ticket
would
know
that
he
could
tune
in
next
thursday
and
know
whether
he
held
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
the
winning
ticket
or
not
and
that's
a
different
case
from
a
public
interest
interview
which
the
commission
really
hasn't
spoken
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because,
well,
our
--
many
people
think
that
the
lottery
statute
are
outmoded
insofar
as
they
apply
to
legal
state's
sponsored
lotteries
and
that
question
is
pending
before
a
congress.
the
attorney
general
has
testified
that
he
thinks
they
should
be
amended,
but
the
congress
has
adapted
a
policy
judgment
here
which
in
the
view
of
many
may
be
quaint
now,
but
it's
still
entitled
to
the
respect
of
the
department
of
justice
and
of
the
federal
communications
commission
in
our
view
of
the
courts
because
it
was
a
permissible
policy
judgment.
it
was
based
on
determinations
spelled
out
in
some
detail,
if
you'd
like
a
citation
in
four
congressional
record
4261
to
4264
that
lotteries
are
injurious
to
people
even
if
they
are
legally
sponsored
and
therefore
the
word
illegal
should
be
removed
from
the
statute
and
that
view
prevailed
in
congress
and
most
states
today
do
not
permit
lotteries.
there
are
still
a
large
body
of
opinion
in
this
country
that
believes
lotteries
are
injurious.
and
there
some
suggestion
has
been
made
that
even
though
an
activities
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
a
broadcast
on
a
newscast
might
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
this
would
be
our
right
because
the
commission
nevertheless,
could
in
applying
the
public
interest
limitations
on
licensees
discipline
the
licensee
for
engaging
in
such
a
broadcast.
i
find
this
a
little
hard
to
imagine
that
the
commission
applying
the
sanction
for
an
action
that
is
constitutionally
protected.
if
it
is
constitutionally
protected
to
broadcast
the
number
--
the
winning
number
of
an
illegal
lottery,
why
is
that
then
a
basis
for
commission
discipline?
i
have
thought
that
from
pittsburg
press
and
capital
broadcasting
that
it
was
fairly
clear
that
it
would
be
--
or
it
could
be
government
could
prevent
a
broadcaster
from
announcing
daily
on
a
newscast
where
is
the
best
place
to
buy
narcotics
today
in
a
way
similar
to
the
announcement
of
where
the
traffic
is
flowing
better,
or
which
bridge
is
from
the
helicopter.
it
seems
to
me
that
was
the
implication
of
those
opinions
in
that
the
first
amendment
issue
is
not
of
such
difficulty
here
as
to
justify
tampering
with
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
and
the
intent
in
history
behind
them.
thank
you.
