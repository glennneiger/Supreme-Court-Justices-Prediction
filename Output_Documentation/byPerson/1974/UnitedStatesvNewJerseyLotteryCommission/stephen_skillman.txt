mr.
stephen
skillman
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
appeal
involves
solely
the
questions
whether
the
lottery
provision
of
the
federal
communications
act,
section
304,
prohibits
broadcasters
from
broadcasting
winning
lottery
numbers
as
part
of
regular
news
shows
and
if
the
lottery
provision
may
be
read
to
reach
that
far,
whether
it
violates
the
free
speech
and
free
press
guarantees
of
the
first
amendment.
section
304
by
its
terms
prohibits
the
broadcasting
of
any
advertisement
of
or
information
concerning
any
lottery.
it
should
be
clear
initially
as
i
believe
as
been
conceded
by
the
fcc,
that
this
section
cannot
be
read
literally
to
prohibit
any
mention
whatever
by
broadcasters
of
information
relating
to
a
lottery.
if
there
were
any
notion
that
it
could
be
or
should
be,
or
was
intended
to
be
read
this
way,
it
would
be
patently
unconstitutional
because
it
would
prohibit
for
example
even
discussion
of
information
about
the
lottery
in
the
context
of
an
editorial
condemning
the
lottery
or
encouraging
the
lottery
or
so
forth.
so,
such
and
interpretation
would
be
clearly
unconstitutional
and
for
that
reason,
the
fcc
has
conceded
that
a
strict
literal
reading
on
the
statute
would
be
inappropriate.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
would
think
your
honor
that
it
could,
although
that
even
--
the
response
to
that
question
may
have
been
confused
somewhat
by
the
passage
of
time
and
the
widespread
circumstances
under
which
other
types
of
gambling
operations
are
at
least
advertised
on
radio
and
television,
but
i
think
despite
that
the
changes
that
have
occurred
in
the
last
few
years,
the
answer
today
is
probably
still
yes
whether
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
would
be
a
far
different
case
if
the
lottery
were
--
if
the
station
were
participant
in
the
lottery
as
distinguished
from
exercising
editorial
judgment
and
seeking
to
meet
a
public
demand
for
information
that
would
be
a
far
different
case
from
the
one
that
that
is
in
fact
before
the
court.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
would
be
inclined
that
in
fact
is
not
true.
there
are
the
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
of
anything
might
exacerbate
the
first
amendment
problem.
certainly,
it
would
cut
off
people
who
have
an
interest
in
the
lottery,
cut
them
off
from
all
information
about
lottery
and
i
would
think
for
that
reason
it
would
not
--
it
would
make
the
problem
even
more
severe
perhaps
but
that
is
the
theoretical,
there
are
many
other
sources
of
information
as
to
the
winning
lottery
number,
including
the
newspapers
for
one
as
well
as
postings
at
various
lottery
locations.
if
it
is
once
conceded
that
a
literal
interpretation
of
1304
is
inappropriate
then
the
question
becomes
what
does
this
section
mean?
i
think
in
addressing
ourselves
to
that
question,
it
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
there
were
no
legal
lotteries
at
the
time
section
1304
was
included
in
the
federal
communications
act
and
it
is
therefore
clear
that
even
if
1304
may
be
said
to
be
addressed
to
legal
lotteries
as
well
as
illegal
lotteries
because
the
distinction
is
not
specifically
drawn
in
the
statute,
that
nonetheless
it
must
be
read
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
setting
in
which
it
was
enacted.
and
by
this
i
mean
that
at
that
time
in
1934,
there
could
have
been
no
conception
in
the
minds
of
the
members
of
congress
that
there
would
be
a
legal
state
lottery
which
would
be
at
such
widespread
public
interest
that
there
might
be
the
type
of
public
demand
for
the
winning
lottery
number
that
could
lead
the
broadcast
news
media
in
the
exercise
of
its
editorial
discretion
to
conclude
that
there
was
a
public
demand
to
know
the
winning
number
and
that
therefore
it
should
be
included
as
part
of
a
regular
news
show.
i
think
secondly
that
1304
must
be
construed
in
light
of
section
1302.
the
fcc
has
urged
this
point
in
stating
that
1304
applies
to
legal
as
well
as
illegal
lotteries
and
we
are
not
disputing
that
point,
but
i
think
that
the
--
if
the
fcc
is
going
to
rely
on
1302
for
that
conclusion
then
it
is
also
fair
for
us
to
rely
on
1302
for
the
further
conclusion
that
the
newspapers,
that
there
is
no
prohibition
and
has
been
no
prohibition
in
the
past
on
the
newspapers
including
as
part
of
the
news
article
the
winning
number
in
a
lottery
and
for
those
newspapers
to
be
sent
through
the
mail.
starting
with
several
early
cases
in
the
1880's
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
the
comaford
and
mason
cases.
the
courts
in
those
cases,
it
were
not
decisions
of
this
court
but
of
lower
federal
courts,
construed
the
lottery
prohibitions
of
1302
and
used
the
mails
very,
very
strictly
and
taking
the
premise
that
1304
was
patterned
after
the
1302
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
give
1304
a
similarly
narrow
construction.
it
also
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
1304
is
a
penal
statute,
a
violation
of
1304
by
a
newscaster
could
lead
to
incarceration
and/or
a
fine
is
therefore
appropriate
to
construe
1304
strictly
and
to
apply
it
only
to
those
commercial
ventures,
commercial
situations
which
are
clearly
within
its
parameters.
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
are
not
taking
the
position,
your
honor
that
1304
does
not
apply
to
legal
lotteries.
we
think
that
in
light
of
the
legislative
background
of
1302
and
the
fact
that
1304
was
patterned
after
1302,
that
we
probably
have
to
make
that
concession
and
i
might
add
that
all
of
the
members
of
the
second
circuit
that
have
considered
this
issue
as
well
as
all
the
members
of
the
third
circuit
who
considered
this
issue
have
come
to
that
conclusion.
mr.
stephen
skillman
the
substantial
constitutional
problems
to
which
we
avert
are
the
basic
free
speech
and
free
press
problems.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
if
you
could
do
that
that
would
avoid
the
first
amendment
problems
but
i
would
have
some
difficulty
urging
to
the
court
that
it
should
reach
that
conclusion
in
light
of
the
legislative
history.
there
are,
however,
very,
very
substantial
first
amendment
problems
in
this
case
if
the
court
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
1304
must
be
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
to
exclude
winning
lottery
numbers
that
are
broadcast
as
part
of
the
regular
news
show.
that's
the
only
question
that's
before
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
would
not
matter.
i
do
think
that
if
a
broadcaster
were
broadcasting
illegal
lottery
numbers
as
part
of
--
a
part
of
new
show
that
there
might
be
questions
as
to
whether
it
was
fulfilling
its
obligations
under
the
public
interest
standard
of
the
communications
act,
so
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
could
be
freely
done.
that
would
be
a
different
question,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
exercise
of
editorial
discretion
by
a
broadcaster
and
there
are
various
kinds
of
topics
of
i
think
that
generally
receive
less
moral
approval
than
lotteries
and
gambling
that
are
the
subject
of
news
broadcast.
we
can
take
the
prostitution
for
example
as
the
subject
of
news
broadcast
and
a
feature
broadcast
whether
it
be
legal
prostitution
and
the
few
counties
where
that
is
in
nevada
or
illigal
prostitution
in
times
square
in
new
york.
mr.
stephen
skillman
they
do,
your
honor
indicate
where
legal
prostitution
or
illegal
prostitution
takes
place
which
may
be
even
more
helpful
information
for
an
interested
party
than
the
type
of
information
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
--
that
the
broadcasters
are
providing
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
if
they
were
illegal
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
we
would
still
have
first
amendment
problems,
your
honor,
but
it
would
certainly
be
a
much
more
difficult
case.
i
think
that
the
element
of
legality
versus
illegality
is
a
significant
one,
but
i
think
that
if
we
made
an
attempt
to
completely
prohibit
the
broadcast
news
media
from
mentioning
winning
numbers,
there
still
might
be
first
amendment
problems.
it
would
be
a
tougher
--
it
would
be
a
closer
first
amendment
case,
but
i
think
there
still
would
be
a
first
amendment
issue
that
might
be
raised
there
by
the
broadcasters.
there
are
only
certain
narrow
exceptions
to
full
first
amendment
protection
for
speech
such
as
the
broadcasting
of
winning
lottery
numbers.
one
recognized
exception
is
that
for
commercial
speech
and
i
think
that's
significant
here
because
it
is
commercial
speech
cases
that
the
fcc
is
relying
upon.
they
have
relied
upon
the
capital
broadcasting
company
case
which
involved
the
congressional
legislation
prohibiting
the
broadcasting
of
cigarette
advertisements.
they
have
relied
heavily
on
the
pittsburg
press
company
case
which
sustained
a
pittsburg
ordinance
prohibiting
sex-based
advertisements
for
employment.
both
cases
clearly
arising
in
the
context
of
commercial
speech
where
the
author
of
the
communication
was
seeking
his
own
commercial
gain.
here
by
contrast
the
author
of
the
communication
is
the
broadcast
news
media
who
are
providing
this
information
to
the
public
in
response
to
what
they
have
decided
in
their
editorial
judgment
is
a
public
demand
for
the
information.
the
communication
is
thus
the
very
heart
of
the
first
amendment.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
the
state
does
have
a
commercial
interest
although
i
might
say
that
the
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
the
commercial
interest
here
is
in
producing
revenue
for
education
and
for
public
institution
so
perhaps
it's
a
commercial
interest
of
a
different
dimension
than
that
what
is
involved
in
the
other
commercial
speech
cases,
but
the
first
amendment
interest
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
would
be
a
totally
different
case.
mr.
stephen
skillman
first
of
all,
we'd
be
clearly
under
1304
because
1304
mentions
advertisement
and
i
think
that
kind
of
a
promotion
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
constitutionally,
i
think
that
we
would
be
within
the
realm
of
the
commercial
speech
doctrine.
i
think
we
still
might
be
before
this
court
arguing
that
the
fcc
had
not
shown
the
type
of
overwhelming
or
compelling
public
need
for
the
restriction
to
justify
it.
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
different
case,
i
think
it
would
be
a
much
harder
case.
in
this
case,
we
have
no
payment
of
money
by
the
state
and
we
are
not
the
author
of
the
communication,
it's
rather
the
broadcaster
who
is
doing
this
in
response
to
what
it
conceives
to
be
a
public
demand
for
the
information.
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
did
not
speak
in
that
terms
your
honor
because
it
found
the
speech
to
be
commercial
speech.
in
that
sense,
perhaps,
i
did
misspeak
myself
in
responding
to
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
in
this
context,
once
we
get
away
from
commercial
speech
and
to
news
broadcasting,
clearly
a
compelling
or
overwhelming
public
interest
is
required
to
sustain
any
type
of
restriction
upon
the
press.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
that
might
depend
on
a
factual
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
broadcast
were
made
by
the
broadcaster
as
an
accommodation
to
the
group
that
was
holding
the
raffle
in
which
event
one
might
not
classify
this
as
news
or
whether
the
broadcaster
came
to
the
conclusion
that's
editorial
judgment
that
there
were
sufficient
public
interest
in
the
information
that
wholly
apart
from
any
accommodation
to
the
person
holding
the
raffle.
it
felt
that
there
was
a
public
demand
for
the
information
and
then
i
would
say
yes,
that
it
would
be
news.
so,
i
think
it
really
comes
down
to
that
process,
who
is
the
author
of
the
communication
and
if
it
can
be
said
that
it's
the
press
that
then
it's
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
i
think
conceptually
if
the
broadcast
news
media
comes
to
the
conclusion
of
the
names
of
winners
are
news
worthy
and
certainly
there
have
been
front
page
newspaper
stories
and
television
features
in
new
jersey
about
the
winners
of
the
millionaire
lottery.
there's
tremendous
public
interest
in
someone
who
is
made
a
millionaire
overnight
and
i've
no
doubt
whatever,
i
don't
think
the
fcc
has
even
taken
the
position
that
that
type
of
communication
falls
within
1304.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that's
correct,
if
on
a
very
technical
literal
analysis
it
would
be
information
concerning
a
lottery
and
i
think
that's
the
reason
that
even
the
fcc
concedes
that
a
literal
analysis
or
a
literal
construction
of
1304
would
not
be
inappropriate
--
excuse
me,
would
not
be
appropriate.
the
second
basic
exception
to
first
amendment
protections
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
fcc
are
those
cases
dealing
with
communications
in
furtherance
of
illegal
activities
such
as
mail
fraud
schemes
or
misrepresentations
in
advertisements
that
maybe
endanger
the
health
of
purchasers
of
consumer
products.
all
of
those
cases
however
deal
with
communications
by
the
parties
engaged
in
the
illegal
enterprise
for
their
own
property.
the
cases
are
thus
closely
related
to
the
commercial
speech
cases
and
do
not
implement
or
do
not
implicate
the
basic
rights
of
the
press
under
the
first
amendment
and
secondly,
all
of
those
cases
deal
with
illegal
activities.
the
mail
fraud,
the
misrepresentation
in
advertising
is
declared
to
be
illegal
and
for
that
reason
the
public
interests
in
preventing
that
form
of
communication
is
evident.
here
on
the
other
hand,
the
subject
of
this
communication,
winning
lottery
numbers
is
itself
clearly
legal
under
state
law
and
as
far
as
federal
law
is
concerned,
i
think
it
must
be
concluded
that
the
federal
position
is
ambivalent
at
best.
the
federal
government
has
imposed
certain
restrictions
such
as
that
contained
in
1304
whatever
it
may
mean,
but
in
other
instances
it
is
permitted,
federal
banks
for
example,
to
handle
the
record
keeping
and
handling
of
money
in
connection
with
the
lottery.
so,
it's
permitted
the
mailing
of
newspapers
and
other
communications
through
the
mail
so
you
have
ambivalent
federal
position.
therefore,
in
any
view
of
the
first
amendment,
the
restriction
that
the
fcc
has
expensed
in
interpretation
in
1304,
imposes
on
broadcasting
could
only
be
sustained
if
there
were
some
overriding
public
interests,
but
the
fcc
has
not
urged
even
any
significant
public
interest
in
their
brief
in
this
case.
they
merely
made
the
conclusionary
statement
that
lotteries
are
suppressible.
the
point
is
that
they
haven't
been
suppressed,
that
they
are
legal
and
that
the
broadcast
news
media
in
its
editorial
discretion
has
concluded
that
there's
sufficient
public
interest
that
the
public
should
be
advised
as
to
the
results
of
the
lotteries.
for
this
reason,
the
communications
enjoy
first
amendment
protection
and
if
the
court
finds
that
1304
must
be
interpreted
to
reach
this
type
of
communication
and
we
submit
that
it
doesn't
have
to
interpret
1304
in
this
manner
then
that
statute
would
be
unconstitutional
in
these
applications.
