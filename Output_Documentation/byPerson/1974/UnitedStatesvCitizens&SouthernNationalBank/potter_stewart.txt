but
may
i
say
--
but
you
told
us
up
to
now,
you
do
not
contend
this
as
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
law?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
giving
us
the
history,
but
i
just
wanted
--
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
all
of
this
sponsorship
and
creation
and
everything
that
went
with
it
what
you
told
us
about
so
far,
you
do
not
submit
there
is
a
violation
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
all
of
these
components,
the
whole
totality
that
you
told
us
about
up
to
know
you
would
not
say
was
a
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seemed
to
me
--
it
would
seem
to
me,
if
i
may
think
out
loud
that
your
case
would
be
is
stronger
if
you
do
not
rely
on
the
sponsorship
in
creation
of
these
banks,
but
rather
analogize
them
to
banks
that
were
independently
sponsored.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice

stewart
there
are
some
pictures
here.
justice
potter
stewart
this
was
in
no
way
of
violation
of
state
law
to
use
the
c&s
name.
