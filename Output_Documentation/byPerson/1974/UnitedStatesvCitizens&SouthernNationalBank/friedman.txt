mr.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellee,
the
citizens
&
southern
national
bank
is
the
largest
banking
organization
in
the
city
of
atlanta,
georgia.
there
are
six
banks
located
in
the
suburbs
of
georgia
in
each
of
which
c&s
as
i
shall
refer
to
it,
has
a
5%
stock
interest.
each
of
these
banks
is
an
independent
corporation
with
its
own
officers
and
its
own
board
of
directors,
but
virtually
since
the
organization
of
these
banks,
c&s
has
treated
them
and
operated
them
as
though
they
were
de
facto
branches
of
c&s.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
which
after
trial
dismissed
a
government
civil
antitrust
suit
challenging
the
relationship
between
these
five
percent
banks
and
c&s.
the
questions
presented
are
first,
whether
the
arrangements
between
c&s
and
the
banks
which
virtually
eliminated
all
competition
between
them
constitutes
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
second
question
is
whether
as
the
district
court
held
the
questions
respecting
the
legality
of
the
relationship
between
c&s
and
the
five
percent
banks
is
a
matter
committed
to
the
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
reserve
board
of
governors.
the
third
question
is
whether
the
acquisition
by
c&s
of
these
five
percent
banks,
thus
making
permanent
this
existing
relationship
which
depended
largely
on
the
inter
adjustments
between
them
and
the
five
percent
stock
interest
whether
that
acquisition
of
the
complete
interest
in
the
five
percent
banks
violated
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
now
with
respect
to
the
clayton
act
issue,
it
should
involves
only
five
rather
than
six
of
the
five
percent
banks
because
with
respect
to
the
sixth
bank,
the
bank
of
tucker,
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
which
has
jurisdiction
over
these
mergers
rejected
that
merger.
so
the
bank
of
tucker
is
involved
only
in
the
sherman
act
aspect
of
the
case,
not
in
the
the
clayton
act
aspect.
mr.
friedman
yes,
what
it
said
was
that
with
respect
to
the
bank
of
tucker
which
was
founded
in
1919,
there
they
said
the
initial
acquisition
by
c&s
in
the
1960's
of
an
interest
and
the
development
of
this
relationship
was
itself
anticompetitive
because
prior
to
the
time,
tucker
and
c&s
had
been
fully
independent
and
competitors,
whereas
it
distinguished
the
other
five
situations
where
they
had
said
there
was
no
competition
between
them
from
the
outset.
now,
at
the
end
of
the
1950's
and
in
the
1960's,
georgia
law
had
two
limitations
upon
it,
which
affected
the
ability
of
c&s
to
expand
into
the
suburbs
of
atlanta.
first,
it
prohibited
c&s
from
opening
branches
beyond
the
city
of
atlanta
and
secondly,
it
prohibited
a
bank
from
acquiring
more
than
five
percent
of
the
stock
in
another
bank.
in
this
period,
the
atlanta
suburbs
like
the
suburbs
of
many
metropolitan
areas
were
expanding
rapidly
and
c&s
devised
a
method
by
which
it
hoped
to
avoid
the
state
law
limitations
on
branching.
what
it
did
was
to
assist
in
the
organization
of
these
suburban
banks
acquired
a
five
percent
interest
in
each
of
these
banks
which
was
the
maximum
permitted
under
state
law
and
then
played
a
role
in
the
operation
of
these
banks
in
supervising
them
and
advising
them
and
managing
them
that
made
them
virtually
a
branch
of
c&s.
mr.
friedman
well,
i
would
--
may
i
answer
the
question
this
way
mr.
chief
justice.
our
position
is
that
the
acquisition
is
bad,
because
were
it
not
for
the
five
percent
arrangement,
the
acquisition
would
violate
the
standards
that
this
court
has
announced
and
our
position
is
that
you
cannot
rely
on
what
we
believe
to
be
the
illegal
situation
that
led
to
the
initial
elimination
of
competition
to
justify
the
claim
that
the
acquisition
now
it
is
not
substantially
less
in
competition.
i
add
one
other
factor
which
i
adverted
to
earlier
that
the
effect
of
the
acquisition
is
to
make
permanent,
to
make
permanent,
a
situation
that
(inaudible)
has
existed
as
a
result
of
relationships.
there
are
two
instances,
one
relating
to
c&s
and
other
one
relating
to
the
trust
company
of
georgia
in
which
banks
in
this
situation
of
the
five
percent
banks
broke
away,
broke
away
and
became
independent
banks.
once
of
course
c&s
acquires
these
banks
that's
the
end
of
it.
they
are
part
of
the
c&s
system.
thereafter,
i
assume
they
would
be
operated
as
branches
in
fact
rather
than
the
de
facto
branches
under
which
they're
not.
so
i
think
to
that
extent,
we
do
show
that
there's
a
different
situation,
because
it
becomes
permanent.
it's
cemented
together
would
be
a
different
situation
after
the
acquisition
that
exists
now.
but
our
other
answer
is,
the
more
fundamental
answer
is
they
cannot
justify,
they
cannot
justify
these
acquisitions
by
the
claim
that
there's
no
lessening
of
competition
because
there
was
no
competition
where
the
result
of
the
lack
of
competition
itself
we
believe
violated
and
flowed
from
a
violation
of
section
1.
mr.
friedman
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
well
we
think
mr.
justice,
the
whole
policy,
the
whole
policy
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
the
purpose
there
preserving
competition
of
avoiding
restraints
in
their
incipiency,
in
order
to
avoid
things
before
they
develop
into
full
violations
of
the
sherman
act,
we
think
that
policy
would
be
subverted,
would
not
be
effectuated,
if
we
would
say
that
because
they
had
previously
eliminated
the
competition.
therefore,
they
can
now
rely
on
that
as
a
justification
and
the
word
substantially
lessen
competition,
we
think
we
do
come
within
that
standard,
because
as
we
discussed
in
our
brief,
looking
at
the
concentration
figures
in
the
atlanta
market
which
this
court
has
indicated
are
sufficient
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case
of
violation.
the
effect
of
this
acquisition
would
be
significantly
to
increase
the
already
concentrated
atlanta
bank
market.
so
we
think
within
the
literal
terms
of
the
statute,
we
have
established
our
burden.
the
only
question
is
whether
it
can
be
offered
as
a
defense
and
answer
to
this
increase
in
concentration
where
really
the
increase
is
insignificant
here,
because
the
result
of
our
prior
violations
--
it's
results
of
our
prior
violations,
we
have
eliminated
the
very
competition
that
section
7
is
intended
to
promote.
mr.
friedman
it
could
well
and
as
i've
indicated.
mr.
friedman
yes
mr.
justice
--
well
what
i
was
suggesting
with
something
mr.
justice,
what
i
was
suggesting
was
that
section
7
is
intended
to
reach
anticompetitive
acquisitions
in
order
to
prevent
the
development
of
a
situation
where
there
would
be
the
actual
elimination
of
competition
as
distinguished
from
the
potential
for
eliminating
competition
that
section
1
is
designed
to
reach.
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
in
speaking
about
reaching
them
in
their
incipiency.
but
we
have
two
instances
in
this
record
one,
a
c&s
bank,
another
a
different
bank
which
did
breakaway
for
various
reason
and
these
banks
are
now
independent
and
are
now
growing.
it
may
well
be
that
if
these
markets
develop
some
of
these
other
banks
would
decide
to
break
away
from
the
control.
now,
let
me
just
prefer
briefly
to
the
kind
of
control
that
c&s
exercised
here,
both
in
the
organization
of
the
banks
and
in
their
operations.
mr.
friedman
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice,
perhaps
i
misspoke
myself.
the
violation
was
not
in
the
formation
of
these
banks.
the
violation
that
we
are
challenging
is
the
operating
relationships
between
c&s
and
the
five
percent
banks
which
stemmed
from
the
way
in
which
they
organized
them,
but
it
was
developed
as
time
went
on
when
they
assumed
virtual
control
over
all
the
operations
of
the
bank.
it's
not
just
the
organization.
we're
not
challenging
the
organization
of
the
bank
itself.
we
don't
say
when
they
acquired
five
percent,
this
violated
section
1.
what
we
say
is
the
whole
relationship
starting
with
the
five
percent
acquisition
then
the
other
things
they
did
in
organizing
the
bank
and
then
the
way
that
they
operated
with
the
bank
and
said
whole
series
of
relationships
we
say
violate
section
1
because
it
did
amounts
to
an
elimination
of
all
competition
between
c&s
and
these
independent
banks.
that's
our
theory,
not
just
the
initial
violation.
mr.
friedman
no,
no,
of
course,
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
friedman
well,
i
think
the
difference
mr.
justice,
the
difference
is
that
the
thrust
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
is
against
restraints
upon
competition
created
by
independent
entities
which
combined.
there
are
many
things
that
an
individual
firm
can
do
if
it's
a
single
entity,
the
two
independent
firms
can't
do.
to
give
a
simple
example,
if
the
firm
has
a
western
division
and
an
eastern
division,
it
can
obviously
direct
that
the
western
division
will
sell
in
the
west,
and
eastern
division
will
sell
in
the
east.
but
--
mr.
friedman
well
i
think
mr.
justice,
the
economic
interest
here
is
the
whole
basic
concept
that
under
the
sherman
act,
you
cannot
use
--
make
arrangements
between
independent
entities
which
eliminates
competition.
it
would
have
been
a
very
different
case
if
georgia
law
had
permitted
it
and
we
would
have
no
objection.
we
would
have
no
objection
at
all
if
these
banks
were
merely
sponsored
and
assisted.
if
c&s
had
treated
these
banks
the
way
it
treats
many
banks
which
it
has
sponsored
with
whom
it
has
correspondent
relationships,
there
would
be
problem.
our
problem
in
this
case
is
that
while
they
purported
to
be
creating
independent
competing
entities,
independent
entities
that
are
supposed
to
operate
independently,
in
fact
they
weren't
independent.
and
we
think
this
court's
decisions
that
we've
cited
some
of
them
in
our
brief
have
recognized
that
once
you
use
the
vehicle
of
separate
corporations
for
whatever
reason,
for
whatever
reason,
once
you
have
used
the
vehicle
of
separate
corporations,
you
have
got
to
treat
them
as
separate
entities.
you
can't
combine
them
together
and
say,
“well,
they
are
separate
entities
for
various
purposes,
but
in
terms
of
seeing
whether
what
these
entities
are
doing
with
each
other,
whether
that's
permissible
under
the
sherman
act,
we
shall
ignore
the
separate
entities
and
treat
them
as
a
single
entity.”
this
court
many
years
ago
in
the
shanley
case,
an
interstate
commerce
case
recognized
the
situation.
there
was
a
situation,
the
question
was
whether
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
distiller
was
engaging
in
private
carriages,
it
held
as
it
contended
or
in
contract
carriages,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
held.
and
the
argument
was,
well
ignore
the
separate
corporate
entity.
it's
true
maybe
--
it
seems
to
be
contract
carriage,
but
we're
doing
it
for
our
parent
and
therefore
it
should
be
treated
as
private
carriage
and
this
court
said
“no.”
this
court
said,
“when
you
elect
to
operate
as
separate
corporations,
you
have
to
comply
with
the
requirements
that
the
law
imposes
on
separate
corporations.”
now
--
mr.
friedman
if
we
had
an
appeal,
i
would
very
much
doubt
it
mr.
justice.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
of
a
case
like
that
that
has
happened,
but
if
it
will
held
that
the
acquisitions
were
valid,
i
would
think
would
be
hard
pressed
to
turnaround
later
on
and
say,
“now,
you
should
hold
that
they
were
invalid.”
i
mean,
we
might
conceivably
if
c&s
reach
the
point
where
it
began
to
assume
monopoly
power
in
the
atlanta
markets,
we
might
proceed
against
them
under
section
2.
but
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
see
how
we
could
in
effect
re-litigate
the
issue
of
the
validity
of
the
acquisitions
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
once
they
had
been
consummated,
i
would
say
it
would
be
comparable
for
example
mr.
chief
justice
i'm
sorry,
if
we
had
never
bought
this
suit
after
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
had
permitted
the
merger.
if
we
never
brought
the
suit
and
under
the
statute
if
we
don't
challenge
it
within
30
days,
the
order
becomes
final.
i
don't
suppose
if
five
years
later
things
got
much
worse,
we
could
then
turnaround
and
challenge
these
acquisitions.
i
assume
would
tell
you
five
years
too
late.
i
would
think
the
same
thing
would
apply
in
this
situation.
now
what
c&s
did
in
the
organization
of
these
banks
was
about
as
follows.
first,
they
helped
them
obtain
a
charter.
that's
a
normal
situation
when
they're
sponsoring
the
bank.
they
help
them
select
a
site,
that's
a
normal
situation.
they
helped
them
sell
stock
that
perhaps
gets
a
little
more.
they
in
effect
selected
the
directors.
this
gets
a
little
more
seriously.
and
then
in
each
case
of
each
one
of
these
five
percent
banks,
they
provided
the
chief
operating
officer.
beginning
in
1965,
all
of
these
five
percent
banks
started
using
the
c&s
name.
mr.
friedman
no,
no,
of
course,
not,
but
we're
just
--
i'm
just
trying
to
set
the
background.
mr.
friedman
setting
the
background
in
the
light
of
which
what
they
did
thereafter.
mr.
friedman
no,
we
don't
--
may
i
make
something
very
clear
mr.
justice
in
light
what
our
opponents
say.
we
don't
claim
that
any
particular
individual
thing
itself
is
a
violation,
what
we
claim
is
that
the
whole
relationship
under
which
all
competition
was
limited.
mr.
friedman
no,
not,
but
the
last
thing
--
the
two
last
things
that
i
come
to
a
beginning
to
develop
reach
into
--
one
is
the
selection
and
the
placing
as
chief
operating
officers
of
the
banks
of
officials
of
c&s.
and
the
record
shows
that
officials
were
shifted
back
and
forth.
every
instance,
the
chief
operating
officer
of
the
bank,
one
of
the
five
percent
banks
was
the
c&s
official
and
in
several
instances
when
c&s
was
displeased
with
the
way
the
officials
were
performing,
they
selected
a
new
official.
mr.
friedman
well,
they
purported
to
be
independently
sponsored.
mr.
friedman
but,
but
things
began
to
develop.
starting
in
1965
each
bank
used
the
c&s
name.
that
is
instead
of
it
being
a
first
national
bank
of
sandy
springs,
it
was
the
c&s
national
bank
of
sandy
spring.
mr.
friedman
there
are
some
pictures
showing
that
and
they
also
used
the
logo
gram
which
is
this
lollipop
like
thing
with
a
distinctive
letter
c&s,
so
when
the
public
pass
by
these
banks,
they
seemed
to
be
c&s
banks.
now,
one
rather
interesting
thing
i've
mentioned
previously
is
that
the
bank,
the
first
bank
that
they
organized
was
something
called
the
bank
of
stone
mountain.
and
the
bank
of
stone
mountain
which
was
first
one
in
this
group
was
the
first
one
out.
stone
mountain
is
no
longer
a
member
of
the
c&s
team.
and
what
happened
was
when
they
came
around
to
these
various
banks
after
georgia
law
had
been
changed
in
1970
permitting
banks
to
expand
beyond
the
city
limits
of
atlanta,
they
wanted
to
merge
with
stone
mountain
and
stone
mountain
didn't
want
to
merge
with
them
and
the
result
was
c&s
sold
its
interest
in
the
bank
and
stone
mountain
is
now
an
independent
functioning
bank.
and
it's
rather
revealing
i
think
that
the
former
president
of
c&s,
the
man
named
mill
lane
testified
that
they
had
a
very
unhappy
relationship
with
stone
mountain.
he
said
the
board
of
directors
of
stone
mountain
was
very
different
from
the
boards
of
directors
of
the
other
five
percent
banks.
the
reason
was
that
the
board
of
director
of
stone
mountain
wanted
to
tell
--
mr.
friedman
yes.
mr.
friedman
i
believe
30%.
mr.
friedman
it
always
30%
mr.
justice.
mr.
friedman
yes.
mr.
friedman
i'm
not
sure
for
the
most
part,
there
was
substantial
number.
there's
figures
in
the
records
and
it
varies
from
bank
to
bank,
but
i
don't
believe
that
there
maybe
have
been
one
or
two,
i
don't
believe
in
most
part
that
even
the
employees,
officers
of
c&s
or
c&s
affiliates
were
majority
stockholders
of
any
of
these
five
percent
banks.
c&s
general
policy
was
not
to
get
away
with
a
situation
unless
their
five
percent
block
was
the
largest.
but
stone
mountain
was
operated
up
to
this
point
as
one
of
these
five
percent
c&s
banks,
it
had
the
name,
c&s
bank
of
stone
mountain.
and
the
complaint
was,
the
complaint
that
mr.
mills
had
was
the
board
of
directors
of
stone
mountain
wanted
to
tell
him
the
president
of
the
bank
what
to
do
and
did
so.
in
other
words,
they
disconnected,
they
disaffiliated
with
stone
mountain,
because
they
couldn't
control
stone
mountain.
stone
mountain
was
an
independent
bank
and
had
the
(inaudible)
to
try
to
be
an
independent
bank
and
they
didn't
like
that.
now,
the
district
court
spelled
out
in
its
findings
at
pages
50
(a)
to
55
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
while
these
findings
are
made
in
connection
with
the
section
7
discussion
of
the
district
court,
the
facts
they
set
forth
are
equally
applicable
to
the
section
1
issue,
exactly
what
it
is
that
c&s
does
in
its
relationship
between
these
banks.
as
i
indicated,
the
officials
move
around
from
bank
to
bank
for
purposes
of
the
c&s
pension
and
profit
sharing
plans,
service
with
the
c&s
bank
is
considered
the
same
as
service
with
one
of
the
five
percent
banks.
c&s
people
review
after
they
have
made
certain
loans
made
by
the
subsidiary
banks.
a
c&s
official
sits
on
the
board
of
directors
of
everyone
of
these
banks
as
an
advisory
director.
c&s
has
an
organization
called
“the
branch
supervisory
department”
and
its
supervises
these
allegedly
independent
banks.
the
customers
of
the
banks
have
available
at
anyone
of
the
five
percent
branches,
all
the
services
rendered
and
made
available
to
customers
of
c&s.
and
particularly
significant,
the
officers
and
officials
of
the
five
percent
banks
receive
and
rely
upon
the
manuals,
directives
and
instructions
that
c&s
puts
out
and
these
include
specific
instructions
and
advice
with
respect
to
their
pricing
practices.
now,
a
number
of
these
instructions
show
at
the
bottom
of
the
instruction
that
a
copy
goes
to
the
president
of
the
five
percent
bank,
which
c&s
describes
as
a
correspondent
associate
for
information
only.
that's
what
it
says.
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
the
text
of
these
things,
it's
quite
clear
that
these
copies
for
information
only
would
just
not
sent
out
in
order
to
keep
the
officials
of
these
five
percent
banks
informed
as
to
what
c&s
was
doing
or
what
c&s
was
thinking.
they
leave
no
doubt,
we
think,
that
c&s
intended
them
to
be
followed.
let
me
just
cite
three
examples.
mr.
friedman
this
is
to
show
--
mr.
friedman
well,
not
that
far.
mr.
friedman
the
five
percent
arrangement.
this
is
directed
to
show
that
in
fact
this
wasn't
just
a
situation
in
which
c&s
gave
out
some
ideas
and
these
banks
voluntarily
said,
this
sounds
like
a
good
thing
to
do,
we
will
independently
follow.
this
is
well
designed
to
show
that
in
fact
--
in
fact
what
you
had
in
this
situation
was
an
agreement
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
between
c&s
and
the
five
percent
banks
that
they
were
to
eliminate
competition.
and
in
everything
including
price
and
one
of
the
purpose
of
these
examples
is
to
show
that
c&s
was
in
effect
telling
the
five
percent
banks
what
to
charge,
what
practices
to
follow.
let
me
just
--
mr.
friedman
no,
no.
mr.
friedman
mr.
justice,
obviously
if
as
we
say
and
as
they
concede
in
effect,
there
is
no
competition
barring
the
acquisitions
will
not
indirectly
increase
competition.
what
it
will
do
though
is
to
keep
alive
the
potential
for
possible
de-concentration
of
these
concentrated
banking
markets,
which
this
court
has
recognized
repeatedly
is
one
of
the
functions
under
section
7.
but
in
addition
to
that,
coming
back
to
what
i
had
said
before
just
to
repeat
it,
that
we
don't
think
they
can
rely
on
the
violation
of
section
1,
a
violation
of
section
1
has
a
justification
for
a
merger
that
is
prima
facie
in
violation
of
section
7.
if
i
may
refer
to
these,
couple
of
these
things,
the
first
one
is
at
e140
and
i
should
mention
that
this
record
is
paginated
that
the
exhibit
volumes
are
separately
paginated
beginning
with
e1.
this
is
a
note
which
goes
not
just
to
the
c&s
officials
with
an
information
copy,
but
this
is
directly
written,
typed
out
to
the
presidents
of
the
correspondent
associates
which
are
the
5-percent
bank.
effective
november
12,
the
c&s
national
bank,
that's
the
lead
bank,
lowered
its
prime
rate
to
seven
and
one
quarter
percent.
for
the
time
being,
this
will
affect
only
those
rates
that
are
tied
to
the
prime.
all
other
rates
will
remain
the
same
until
further
notice.
if
you
should
have
any
questions,
please
give
me
a
call.
this
is
from
the
assistant
vice
president
of
the
division
of
branch
superintendent.
then
at
e145
is
to
all
of
the
managers
and
the
affiliates
with
again
information
copy
to
the
president
of
the
five
percent
banks,
encloses
a
memorandum
and
revised
rate
chart
from
gordon
trulock
as
always,
the
chart
reflects
the
minimum
rate
which
should
be
charged
and
then
at
the
bottom
of
the
paragraph,
loans
to
local
corporations
should
carry
a
rate
of
at
least
10%.
and
finally
at
page
e147,
the
1969
memorandum
saying,
“rates
on
all
l&d
loans
except
prime
customers
should
be
adjusted
to
8%.
and
then
it
goes
on
at
the
bottom
of
that
page
and
says,
“we
are
still
not
making
speculative
real
estate
and
development
loans.”
mr.
friedman
we
act
out
stronger
than
that.
i
go
stronger
than
that
mr.
justice.
this,
we
think,
compels
the
conclusion
that
what
was
done
here
was
the
result
of
an
agreement,
of
a
combination
of
a
concert
of
action.
mr.
friedman
yes,
yes,
we
did.
mr.
friedman
what
the
district
court
found
--
the
district
court
found
in
this
case
that
this
was
not
the
result
of
any
agreement
because
as
it
put
it,
this
denied
that
the
service
or
information
received
by
these
banks
from
c&s
was
the
result
of
any
tacit
or
explicit
combinations
rather
than
the
natural
deference
of
the
recipient
to
information
from
one
with
greater
expertise
or
better
sources.
mr.
friedman
we
think
the
ultimate
finding,
the
ultimate
finding
of
no
agreement
in
this
case
is
clearly
erroneous.
it's
clearly
erroneous,
because
we
think
it
fails
to
recognize
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
defining
what
constitutes
an
agreement
for
purposes
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
under
section
1,
you
don't
have
to
have
an
explicit
agreement.
it's
rare
that
you
have
that.
it's
a
course
of
conduct
and
you
look
to
the
entire
course
of
conduct
to
determine
whether
what
happened
was
the
result
of
wholly
independent
business
judgment
or
whether
it
was
the
result
of
some
tacit
understanding.
now,
i
suggest
that
it's
difficult
to
believe
that
wholly
independent
banks,
that
wholly
independent
banks
with
their
own
officers,
with
their
own
boards
of
directors
responsible
to
all
of
the
stockholders
would
permit
a
five
percent
stockholder
to
have
an
advisory
director
sitting
with
them
at
all
the
board
meetings
to
have
a
five
percent
bank
stockholder
review
their
loans
would
follow
all
of
these
instructions
raising
prices,
changing
prices,
failing
to
change
prices
when
c&s
objected
that
they
would
have
done
that
without
there
being
some
tacit
understanding
that
this
is
how
the
banks
were
going
to
operate
and
we
think
this
is
very
clear
from
the
whole
record
in
this
case
that
it
was
understood.
it
was
understood
that
this
is
how
it
was
going
to
operate
and
this
is
the
way
it
operated.
let
me
give
one
very
--
mr.
friedman
plus
the
name,
thank
you
mr.
justice.
normally
an
independent
bank
without
some
understanding
wouldn't
permit
its
business
to
be
operated
under
the
name
of
someone
else
and
wouldn't
permit
its
customers
to
have
available
at
it,
all
the
services
that
are
supplied
in
a
five
percent
struggle.
let
me
just
give
one
very
illuminating
example
i
think
of
the
kind
of
relationship
in
control
you
had
in
this
case,
which
is
something
we
cited
in
our
reply
brief.
the
president
of
bank
of
chamblee,
one
of
the
five
citizens
in
southern
bank
of
chamblee
wanted
to
raise
his
interest
rates
on
deposits
from
3.5%
to
4%,
because
he
felt
he
needed
this
to
compete
with
another
local
bank
in
the
area.
but
before
he
undertook
this
step,
he
felt
it
necessary
to
write
to
c&s
and
find
out
if
they
had
any
objection
to
it.
so
he
so
wrote
and
he
then
had
a
discussion
with
a
c&s
official
who
objected
and
the
result
of
it
was
the
president
of
chamblee
did
not
raise
his
interest
rates
to
4%.
we
had
another
example
described
in
our
main
brief
at
pages
11
in
the
lengthy
footnote,
footnote
2
that
c&s
put
out
an
announcement
that
it
was
changing
and
increasing
its
service
rates
on
checking
accounts.
it
didn't
state
the
date.
this
was
in
february
1970.
many
of
the
five
percent
banks
had
different
service
rates,
but
on
the
first
of
april,
all
of
a
sudden
all
of
them,
all
of
them,
everyone
of
them
suddenly
adopted
uniform
rates
and
not
only
the
special
checking
accounts
but
the
regular
checking
account,
rates
that
will
uniform
with
those
that
c&s
had
adopted.
now,
the
argument
is
made
to
which
mr.
justice
powell
alluded
earlier
that
this
was
perfectly
alright
because
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
restrictions
of
georgia
banking
law,
the
banks
would
have
been
organized
initially
as
branches
of
c&s
and
if
they
had
been
branches
of
c&s
everything
that
we
challenge
would
have
been
permissible.
now,
these
banks
as
i
want
to
repeat
again
because
i
think
it's
at
the
crux
of
our
case.
these
banks
are
separate
entities.
these
banks
are
separate
entities
and
a
separate
entities,
and
the
separate
entities.
these
banks
have
to
operate
the
way
the
sherman
act
requires
the
separate
entities.
they
cannot
themselves
eliminate
and
restrain
competition
between
them.
let
me
if
i
may
read
two
sentences
from
the
court's
opinion
in
the
perma
life
muffler
case
in
392
u.s.
where
that
was
a
private
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
dismissed
the
sherman
act
claim
on
the
theory
that
the
two
respondents
midas
and
its
apparent
which
owned
all
of
the
stock
international
were
a
single
entity,
and
therefore
incapable
of
conspiracy
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument.
what
it
said
was,
“but
since
the
respondents
midas
international
avail
themselves
of
the
privilege
of
doing
business
through
separate
cooperations,
the
fact
of
common
ownership
could
not
save
them
from
any
of
the
obligations
that
the
law
imposes
on
separate
entities.
that
was
the
case
where
there
were
wholly
own
subsidiaries.
this
is
a
case
where
they're
only
5%
subsidiaries.
now,
let
me
turn
to
one
other
aspect
of
this
case,
the
court
--
district
court
set
as
an
alternative
ground
of
dismissing
the
complaint
that
this
was
a
matter
that
lay
wholly
within
the
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
reserve
board.
it's
rather
technical
argument,
it
turns
on
the
language
of
the
bank
holding
company
act.
we
have
i
believe
fully
covered
it
in
our
brief.
i
will
just
summarize
in
the
sentence
or
two
that
the
bank
holding
act
authorizes
the
board
to
approve
acquisitions,
mergers
or
consolidations
or
acquisitions
of
control
and
that's
the
only
thing
it
gives
the
board
jurisdiction
of
it.
i
challenged
--
i've
indicated
is
not
to
the
acquisition
or
to
the
control
as
such
but
to
the
way
in
which
they
exercised
it.
and
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
bank
holding
company
act
which
we
have
set
forth
at
page
47
of
our
brief
that
says,
“nothing
in
this
in
anyway
prevents
the
liability
under
the
antitrust
laws.
and
we
think
that
whatever
one
may
think
of
the
role
of
the
federal
reserve
board
in
dealing
with
this
situation
quite
clearly,
it
is
covered
by
this
exemption.
now,
the
district
court
in
this
case
assumed
for
purposes
of
discussion
under
the
section
7
issue,
the
markets
that
the
government
had
posited.
it
didn't
define
the
markets.
and
if
we
are
correct
in
our
submission
to
this
court,
the
case
must
be
remanded
for
the
district
court
to
define
the
relevant
markets.
and
it
also
set
forth
in
considerable
detail
the
increases
in
concentration
that
would
result
in
the
event
this
merger
took
place.
but
then
it
said
all
of
this
really
is
beside
the
point,
because
as
a
result
of
what
is
previously
happened,
there
is
no
competition
now
between
c&s
and
the
five
percent
banks.
in
other
words
what
they're
saying
is
that
the
defendants
can
overcome
the
prima
facie
illegality
of
this
merger
under
the
settled
standards,
because
of
their
own
violations
of
section
1.
we
think
as
we've
said
in
our
brief,
this
would
just
stand
section
7
on
its
head.
the
purpose
of
section
7
is
to
prevent
these
restraints
at
the
outset,
in
their
incipiency
before
they
develop
into
full
blown
violations
of
section
1.
now
the
claim
is
that
the
full
blown
violation
of
section
1
somehow
saves
from
illegality
a
merger
which
had
it
not
been
for
that
violation
under
this
court's
standards
would
be
illegal.
we
don't
think
that
is
the
way
section
7
can
be
read
and
we
think
that
under
this
court's
decisions,
this
merger
the
arrangements
violate
section
1
and
the
merger
cannot
pass
muster
under
section
7.
mr.
friedman
i
would
say
each
one
--
i
would
say
each
one
mr.
justice
was
because
in
each
case,
each
five
percent
bank
was
an
independent
entity
and
in
each
instance
what
you
had
was
the
complete
elimination
of
competition
between
c&s
and
the
fives.
indeed,
in
the
one
case,
the
bank
of
tucker
that
i
mentioned
earlier,
for
--
from
1919
to
1965,
tucker
was
a
wholly
independent
bank.
and
then
c&s
acquired
to
5%
interest
rate
in
tucker
changed
its
name
to
the
bank
of
tucker
and
proceeded
to
treat
it
as
though
it
were
a
branch.
i
think
this
is
the
clearest
example,
but
the
others
never
had
even
a
chance
to
develop
as
independent
entities.
from
the
outset
c&s
stifled
their
competitive
potential.
mr.
friedman
i
don't
believe
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
friedman
an
agreement
and
understanding
not
to
compete
at
all
in
anyway.
not
just
fixing
prices,
but
not
to
compete
in
anyway.
mr.
friedman
that's
correct.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
friedman
if
there
was
no
realistic
possibility
at
all,
if
they
were
completely
independent,
i
doubt
it
very
much,
but
that's
not
this
case.
that's
not
this
case
mr.
justice
because
c&s
itself
had
three
subsidiaries
in
which
it
owned
90%
or
more
of
the
stock
which
puts
conceivably
--
might
have
been
competing
with
these
banks.
we
don't
know.
mr.
friedman
well,
i
think
i
interpreted
--
mr.
friedman
yeah,
i
interpreted
justice
white's
question
as
meaning
whether
it
would
be
necessary
to
define
a
market
in
the
way
that
it
is
normally
defined
for
section
7
purposes,
my
answer
is
no,
not
under
section
1.
but
this
is
all
--
this
is
in
the
atlanta
area
and
these
are
suburban
banks
and
there
is
--
there
is
--
for
example
the
record
shows
that
not
infrequently
people
may
want
to
--
there's
a
question
whether
you
want
to
bank
where
you
live
out
in
the
suburbs
or
whether
you're
going
to
bank
in
town.
if
it's
an
independent
bank,
you
may
decide
to
bank
in
the
suburbs
and
not
bank
in
town.
so
there
could
have
been
we
think
very
real
competitive
potential
between
c&s
and
truly
independent
banks
in
the
suburbs,
independent
banks
that
were
not
operated
by
c&s's
branches.
thank
you.
mr.
friedman
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
just
answer
two
or
three
things
--
say
two
or
three
things.
first,
we
are
not
of
course,
suggesting
that
there
should
be
any
court
decree
ordering
these
banks
to
compete.
what
we're
asking
is
that
a
court
decrees
stop
these
restraints
upon
competition
that
have
been
imposed
through
this
relationship.
the
reason
we
didn't
challenge
this
relationship
in
1968
when
the
federal
reserve
board
staff
had
an
investigation
because
we
didn't
know
all
the
facts
at
that
time,
indeed
mr.
layne
told
the
federal
reserve
board
hearing
that
they'd
always
follow
the
philosophy
of
influencing
but
not
controlling
these
banks.
it
wasn't
until
we
really
began
to
investigate
this
case
after
we
received
notice
from
the
fdic
that
these
applications
for
merger
had
been
filed
that
we
discovered
all
of
the
facts.
now
i
also
want
to
make
it
very
clear
that
we
have
no
objection
to
the
organization
of
these
banks,
to
their
assistance
in
organizing
those
banks.
and
indeed,
in
the
marine
bank
corporation
case
to
which
reference
has
been
made,
there
our
argument
was
that
this
was
a
permissible
method
of
a
bank
entering
into
a
new
market
by
sponsoring
a
new
bank
and
ultimately
perhaps
acquiring
it.
but
sponsoring
a
bank
and
joining
a
normal
correspondent
relationship
with
it
as
a
far
cry
from
what
c&s
has
done
in
this
case.
now
the
argument
that's
been
suggested
--
this
whole
thing
is
an
exercise
in
futility,
because
if
we
were
to
prevail
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
c&s
five
percent
banks
would
disassociate
from
c&s
things
would
be
continued
in
their
previous
manner.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
if
we
are
correct
in
our
argument
that
this
arrangement
violates
the
sherman
act,
steps
will
have
to
be
taken
to
terminate
this
kind
of
a
relationship.
they
are
not
going
to
continue
in
the
same
way
despite
a
holding
that
the
arrangement
violates
the
sherman
act
there
undoubtedly
going
to
have
to
stop
using
the
name,
they're
going
to
have
to
stop
reviewing
their
loans.
they're
going
to
have
to
stop
having
a
director
sitting
as
an
advisory
man
on
the
board
of
director.
there's
going
to
be
some
changes
in
the
relationship.
and
once
these
changes
have
taken
place
it
may
well
be
that
some
of
these
five
percent
banks,
that
are
so
satisfied
with
the
present
relationship
may
take
another
look
at
it.
they
may
then
decide
that
without
this
crutch,
without
this
control
on
operation
by
c&s
maybe
they'd
be
better
off
in
an
independent
basis.
now
whatever
the
reasons
there
may
be
for
c&s
wanting
these
banks
not
to
compete,
the
question
was
put
to
why
on
earth
would
c&s
want
to
stop
these
banks
from
competing?
the
fact
is
for
whatever
reasons
that's
exactly
what
they
have
done.
they
have
an
arrangement
between
them
under
which
the
banks
don't
compete
and
they
in
effect
tell
the
banks
how
to
compete.
we
challenge
the
basic
underlying
arrangement.
you
can't
segmentize
an
arrangement
eliminating
competition
by
saying,
“well
this
memo
didn't
do
it
and
that
piece
of
paper
doesn't
do
it.”
i
think
you've
got
to
look
at
the
totality
of
the
relations.
and
when
you
look
at
the
totality
of
the
relationship
i
think
the
fact
that
the
five
percent
banks
are
independent
banks
that
they
are
not
branches
of
c&s.
they
were
started
originally
as
independent
banks.
c&s
has
always
claimed
that
they
are
independent
banks.
c&s
says,
“we
don't
control
these
banks.
they
are
independent
banks.”
but
when
you
look
to
see
how
they
behave
in
the
light
of
their
understanding
with
c&s,
we
see
they
are
not
independent
banks
at
all.
c&s
treats
them
as
though
they
were
branches.
they
are
not
branches,
they
are
independent
entities
with
independent
duties
and
responsibilities
and
as
independent
entities,
they
can
not
understand
and
agree
with
the
c&s
to
eliminate
all
competition
between.
