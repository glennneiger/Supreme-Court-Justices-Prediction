justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
friedman,
before
you
go
into
that
you've
said
a
few
moments
ago
that
so
far
as
the
sherman
act
was
concerned,
there
was
an
initial
violation
in
the
formation
as
i
understand
it
of
these
five
percent
banks.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
that
basis
of
that
theory.
if
georgia
law
had
been
different
and
these
five
branches
had
been
organized
as
branches,
would
there
had
been
any
violation
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
what
is
the
economic
difference?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
historically,
i've
also
understood
that
it
was
a
policy
of
the
antitrust
division
to
encourage
banks
to
open
branches
which
stimulate
competition.
so
my
question
directed
to
you
related
to
the
economic
injury,
in
other
words
what
interest
is
the
government
protecting
here
that
would
not
be
involved
or
implicated
if
georgia
law
had
been
different
as
indeed
it
should
have
been
perhaps
to
allow
banks
to
follow
their
customers
into
the
suburbs
as
they
move
to
the
suburbs.
what
is
the
economic
injury?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
friedman.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
excuse
me
to
interrupting
you,
but
i
wonder
whether
the
stone
mountain
as
i
recollect
it
is
fairly
comparable,
wasn't
there
a
stockholder
who
owned
more
than
50%
of
that
bank?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
30%.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
for
sec
purposes,
it's
more
than
abundant
for
control?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
any
event,
the
stockholders
of
the
other
5
percent
banks
as
i
recall
were
for
the
most
part
employees,
officers
and
directors,
and
the
stockholders
of
c&s.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
is
also
a
fact,
an
economic
fact
in
some
localities
that
when
banks
of
this
kind
are
organize
the
stockholders
looked
down
the
road
to
the
day
when
laws
will
permit
mergers
and
then
they
will
acquire
the
stock
of
the
c&s
bank.
