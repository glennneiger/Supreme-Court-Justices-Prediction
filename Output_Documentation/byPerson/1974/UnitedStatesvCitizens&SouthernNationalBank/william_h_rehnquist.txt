h.
rehnquist
mr.
friedman,
you
say
this
supports
--
would
support
a
finding
of
an
agreement
not
to
compete?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
government
submit
proposed
findings
to
the
district
court
to
this
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
district
court
refused
to
make
this
finding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
government
to
upset
the
district
court's
conclusion
has
to
say
that
it's
clearly
erroneous.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
what
the
bank
in
birmingham
agreed
with
the
bank
in
atlanta
not
to
compete
and
in
fact
there
was
no
real
realistic
possibility
of
competition
between,
would
that
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
you
have
to
know
something
about
the
market
then
in
order
to
answer
justice
white's
question.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know
that.
