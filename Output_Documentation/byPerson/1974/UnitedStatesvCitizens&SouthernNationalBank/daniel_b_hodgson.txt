mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
like
to
approach
our
argument
today
this
way.
first,
we
would
like
to
touch
on
some
of
the
facts
that
we
believe
should
have
emphasis
in
order
to
land
the
importance
to
our
sponsors
to
the
government's
grave
charges.
secondly,
we
would
like
to
make
our
argument
that
because
c&s
and
its
associated
five
percent
banks
have
been
so
closely
related
from
the
very
beginning
without
change,
no
lessening
of
competition
would
result
from
the
acquisitions.
and
then
we
would
like
to
add
sir,
the
department's
charges
that
these
relationships
are
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
in
some
instances,
it
appears
to
be
claimed
per
se
by
virtue
of
the
entire
association
between
these
banks
and
then
again
it
appears
to
be
per
se
basically
on
the
price
information
memoranda
that
had
been
discussed
this
morning.
then
we
would
like
to
discuss
what
is
perhaps
the
most
important
charge
whether
or
not
the
association
amounts
to
an
unreasonable
restraint,
absent
a
per
se
finding.
and
then
we
would
like
to
conclude
without
thesis
that
an
affirmance
by
this
court
would
bring
only
beneficial
competitive
results.
now
the
department
is
very
lightly
and
selectively
touched
upon
some
of
the
facts
although
it
is
surely
not
misrepresented
there.
i
think
it's
important
for
us
to
place
ourselves
in
the
environment
in
which
all
of
this
conduct
took
place.
the
city
of
metropolitan
atlanta
has
exploded
in
the
last
two
decades,
or
decade
and
a
half.
there
are
no
geographical
barriers
or
restrictions
to
this
growth
and
it
has
been
heavy.
but
the
political
response
to
this
growth
has
not
been
comparable.
the
city
of
atlanta
has
been
restrained
since
1952
to
a
bare
city
limits
of
a
mean
radius
of
seven
miles
and
there
seems
to
be
no
hope
to
get
that
remedy.
it
is
surrounded
by
numerous
small
towns
and
villages
and
small
cities.
at
the
time
the
case
was
tried,
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
encompassed
five
counties
with
the
rough
radius
of
25
miles,
much
larger.
and
today
the
smsa
is
15
counties
with
a
rough
radius
of
40
miles.
now
as
these
political
restrictions
on
city
limits
are
clear,
it
is
also
clear
that
the
limitations
on
internal,
extension
and
expansion
by
banks
in
the
state
of
georgia
has
been
seriously
restricted.
because
beginning
as
early
as
1927,
no
branching
has
been
allowed
in
the
state
of
georgia
except
within
the
city
limits
where
the
bank
is
located.
and
until
1960,
it
could
--
they
could
not
expand
even
where
they
had
owned
any
branches.
only
13
states
continue
so
absolutely
to
restrain
internal
bank
expansion.
none
of
georgia's
neighbors
does.
c&s
system
is
expansive
mandate.
it
is
aggressive.
in
1928,
it
met
these
barriers
by
forming
a
holding
company
which
over
a
period
of
the
next
20
odd
years,
formed
a
majority
owned
affiliates
throughout
the
state,
three
of
which
are
in
the
metropolitan
in
atlanta.
but
in
1956,
a
barrier
was
put
up
again
and
today
no
bank
--
no
bank
holding
company
may
expand
through
the
holding
company
affiliation
realm
in
the
state
of
georgia.
the
legislative
forces
supported
by
the
protectionist
demanded
the
unit
bankers
in
the
state
as
we
see
it
have
drawn
hard
barriers
against
competitive
expansion,
all
market
extension,
barriers
drawn
sharply
at
the
city
limits.
now
the
purpose
of
this
historic
exercise
is
to
demonstrate
why
this
was
done.
there
was
no
purpose
here
to
do
anything
in
violation
of
antitrust
laws.
it's
simply
that
was
developed
an
innovative
and
entirely
pro-competitive
expansion
procedure
which
had
to
observe
their
requirements,
their
restrictions
on
stock
ownership
required
by
the
state
bank
holding
company
law.
so
here's
what
was
done.
let's
leave
out,
tucker
for
a
moment.
with
respect
to
the
five
banks
which
are
before
this
court
today
on
the
section
7
charge.
if
c&s
organized
these
new
banks,
it
didn't
participate
with
all
of
us
in
doing
so,
it
organized
them.
in
areas
where
banks
had
never
been
before
and
beyond
the
city
limits
of
atlanta
where
c&s
could
not
go
and
could
not
compete
and
could
not
until
the
law
was
changed
allowing
these
applications
for
merger.
second,
it
did
so
in
instances
where
other
local
interest
had
tried
and
failed
and
this
is
in
the
record.
had
tried
and
failed
because
the
absence
of
significant
financial
footings
and
banking
knowhow.
it
was
done
in
every
instance
with
the
expectation
of
everyone
involved
all
of
the
shareholders
and
the
record
is
replete
with
this.
the
neighbors,
the
competitors,
all
knew
that
it
was
formed
this
way
under
c&s
sponsorship
to
be
managed
by
c&s
so
far
as
law
permitted
ultimately
to
merge
into
c&s.
and
this
procedure
was
supported
by
the
responsible
bank
regulators.
state
and
federal
realizing
that
the
strength
of
c&s
financial
and
managerial
support
would
be
behind
these
new
little
banks
and
thus
would
ensure
their
solvency
and
their
success.
and
serve
the
convenience
and
needs
of
these
communities
which
otherwise
were
not
being
served
and
the
record
is
clear
that
others
had
tried.
these
historic
organizational
factors
are
unique
and
they
were
complete
from
the
beginning.
they
did
not
change.
the
department
said
this
was
competitively
insignificant
when
made,
the
district
court
found
there
were
no
changes
in
this
respect.
and
the
burden
was
on
the
government
to
prove
it
if
it
were
so
from
the
time
they
were
formed
until
the
time
this
case
was
trialled.
i
would
not
mention
the
stone
mountain
bank
except
that
it's
been
brought
up
here,
because
the
record
is
so
clear,
so
clear.
c&s
did
not
organize
that
bank.
it
had
been
in
existence
two
years
before
any
affiliation
occurred.
c&s
was
asked
by
the
stone
mountain
incorporators,
do
you
have
anyone
who
can
help
us?
they
said,
“yes
sir.
there's
a
fellow
named
arthur
drew
who
used
to
work
for
c&s.
he
is
retired.
he
might
help
you.
he
was
the
motivating
force
there.”
it
is
clear
that
the
mccarthy
family
owned
35%
of
the
stock
of
that
bank.
it
is
also
clear
that
there
was
continued
resistance
to
support
and
advice
from
c&s
to
that
bank
and
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
not
a
comparable
circumstance
just
as
it
did
with
the
peachtree
bank
&
trust
company.
the
trust
companies
affiliate
in
the
chamblee
area
which
likewise
had
serious
distinguishing
characteristics
which
do
not
appear
in
this
case.
they
are
not
appropriate
for
argument
that
these
banks
would
break
away,
would
become
independent
competitive
forces
and
the
district
court
found
that
is
a
fact
also.
now,
during
the
decade
of
the
60s,
all
six
of
these
little
banks
including
tucker
for
this
purpose
retained
the
following
important
characteristics
which
further
distinguished
them.
the
ownership
of
shares
--
stock
shares
over
and
above
that
held
by
the
holding
companies,
the
five
percent
permitted
by
state
law
was
spread
among
many
individuals.
there
were
no
blocks.
any
concentration
being
in
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
five
percent
associated
bank
and
many
offices,
directors
and
friends
of
c&s
generally
who
were
aware
of
the
purpose
and
intent
of
this
program
to
supply
these
services
in
these
areas.
these
five
percenters
were
authorized
to
use
the
c&s
names
and
share
a
joint
identification
with
c&s
services
advising
the
public
they
were
competing
as
c&s
banks.
now,
the
point
is
made,
this
happened
later.
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
no
sir.
if
your
honor
please,
it
is
not.
as
long
as
you
get
consent
from
the
commission
of
banking
finance
then
superintendent
of
the
banks
is
perfectly
alright,
just
as
it
is
for
the
coca-cola
company
to
authorize
the
coca
cola-bottling
company
of
thomasville,
the
coca-cola
bottling
company
of
albany
and
so
forth.
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
very
some,
if
your
honor
please,
in
an
area
where
at
this
point
in
time
c&s
could
not
go,
could
not
have
its
own
direct
operation.
let
me
say
something
has
been
made
to
the
fact
that
the
name
was
not
part
of
the
original
package
where
for
most
it
was,
the
later
one.
and
the
earlier
ones
it
was
no
surprise
to
anyone,
the
record
is
complete.
that
all
knew
these
were
c&s
banks.
the
citizen's
bank
of
sandy
springs
for
example
had
its
lollipop,
c
for
citizen's
and
s
for
sandy
springs.
there
was
no
doubt
in
anyone's
mind
that
these
were
c&s
banks
owned
by
other
stockholders
because
this
was
required,
but
operated
by
c&s
in
order
to
supply
these
services
there.
a
third
critical
distinction
is
that
full
c&s
services
in
advice
were
regularly
and
systematically
supplied
and
no
one
offended
the
requirements
of
corporate
law
and
fiduciary
duties
imposed
upon
directors
and
officers
to
serve
their
shareholders.
but
this
information
expertly
was
supplied
by
c&s
to
these
little
banks
including
categories
of
services
that
were
not
routinely
furnished
to
correspondents.
there
were
no
secrets
about
these
services,
none
whatsoever.
anyone
can
see
anything
they
want
to
see.
most
importantly,
these
services
were
expected
and
relied
upon
by
these
little
banks.
otherwise,
the
regulators
would
not
have
issued
charters
in
the
first
place.
and
as
i
suggested
there
was
the
expressed
intent
and
expectation
to
merge
just
as
soon
as
state
law,
the
restrictive
branching
law,
or
the
restrictive
holding
company
law
permitted
this
to
be
done
de
jure.
may
we
observe
at
this
point
that
when
the
general
assembly
of
georgia
allowed
branch
expansion
into
the
counties
which
isn't
much,
immediately
indeed,
foreseeing
this
in
january
1,
‘71
these
applications
were
filed.
and
they
were
described
in
the
application
a
copy
of
which
went
to
the
department
of
justice
as
being
virtually
operated
and
directed
as
de
facto
branches.
there
was
no
secret
about
it
then
as
they
had
never
been.
this
was
the
very
language,
which
the
department
used
before
this
court,
four
years
later
in
the
marine
case
to
describe
what
it
called
a
sanction
pro-competitive
procedure
in
instances
where
de
novo
branching
--
de
jure
branching
was
denied.
the
regulators
knew
it
and
all
of
the
competitors
of
c&s
and
these
banks
were
precisely
interviewed
by
the
commission
of
banking
and
finance
to
see
whether
or
not
they
had
objection
and
they
had
none,
why?
because
they
were
c&s
banks
from
the
beginning.
and
then
the
department
filed
this
suit,
which
stated
the
acquisitions,
charge
for
the
first
time,
the
first
news
we
had
that
these
were
charges
of
having
engaged
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
we
argue
of
course,
that
because
c&s
and
its
associated
banks
have
been
so
closely
related
from
the
beginning
that
no
lessening
of
competition
could
possibly
result
from
these
acquisitions.
the
department
relies
on
market
statistics,
you've
heard
the
argument
this
morning.
but
the
department
neglected
to
present
any
evidence
for
relating
those
statistics
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case
so
far
as
sherman
7
is
concerned.
most
importantly
its
own
economic
expert
dr.
scott
tait
testified
that
he
did
not
take
into
account
the
relationship
between
c&s
and
its
associated
banks
when
he
was
examining
the
economic
consequences
of
the
proposed
transactions.
that
which
he
did
not
take
into
account
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
our
case
is,
c&s
market
shares
for
purposes
of
applying
the
standards
of
the
bank
merger
act
or
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
have
always
included
the
market
shares
of
its
associates.
since
the
five
percent
banks
have
never
competed
as
anything
but
c&s
banks.
they
were
created
de
novo
by
c&s
for
that
very
purpose.
they
are
part
of
a
single
enterprise
in
fact
and
in
substance
though
they
take
the
separate
corporate
form
only
to
avoid
violation
of
the
state
bank
holding
company
law.
and
without
that
organization,
the
evidence
is
clear
that
the
separate
competitive
forces
in
dekalb
county
and
beyond
the
city
limits
of
atlanta
would
not
be
in
the
marketplace
today.
put
in
another
way,
at
the
very
time
that
these
small
banks
were
organized,
the
de
facto
merger
took
place.
de
facto
by
open
and
notorious
behavior
and
declared
intent
not
that
de
jure
because
of
restrictive
state
law.
the
form
being
used
only
in
order
to
allow
market
extension
without
the
violation
of
that
law.
the
substance
was
to
produce
de
facto
branches.
and
for
purposes
of
applying
the
antitrust
laws
which
deal
with
competitive
and
anti-competitive
purpose
in
effect
the
teaching
of
this
court
to
us
to
look
to
substance
and
not
form,
indeed
the
department's
own
authorities
take
us
this
way
and
indeed
this
is
the
very
procedure,
the
department
sanctioned
in
marine
and
this
is
what
it
said,
“banks
in
the
state
of
washington
have
achieved
de
novo
entry
and
to
areas
foreclosed
to
de
novo
branching
by
sponsoring
the
organization
of
an
affiliate
bank
and
later
acquiring
the
bank.
since
the
associates
were
created
by
and
have
always
competed
as
c&s
banks
to
this
entire
history
for
every
intended
purpose.”
there
is
no
possibility
that
a
former
corporate
reorganization
will
produce
anything
but
the
same
corporate
substance
and
the
same
competitive
statistics.
the
department
said
that
when
the
original
sponsorship
of
the
new
banks
and
c&s
commitment
to
the
charting
authorities
was
made.
this
did
not
violate
the
act.
the
obligation
on
the
part
of
c&s
and
the
expectation
of
these
little
banks
that
c&s
would
supply
them
full
management
counsel
and
advice,
the
department
declared
was
competitively
insignificant.
the
district
court
found
later,
the
government
has
not
carried
its
burden
of
demonstrating
any
substantial
increase
in
the
degree
of
control
or
change
in
quantity
of
competition
between
the
date
of
initial
acquisitions
and
the
date
of
trial.
if
competitively
insignificant
when
created
and
if
all
that's
happened
since
that
time
has
been
the
carrying
out
of
the
original
obligations
openly
declared.
the
perpetuation
of
an
association
must
likewise
be
competitively
insignificant
where
no
change
has
occurred.
the
district
court
so
found.
the
only
thing
that
would
prompt
any
further
argument
before
this
court
today
is
the
charge
made
by
the
department
that
the
relationships
that
are
involved
here
violate
the
sherman
act.
and
so
we
turn
to
those
charges.
as
we
do
so,
we
asked
the
court
carefully
to
notice
the
department's
total
failure
to
prove
a
nexus
between
the
alleged
section
1
violations
that
are
so
broadly
and
vaguely
talked
about
here
today.
and
the
section
7
complained.
the
department
assumes
take
away
the
behavior
which
it's
hard
to
describe,
it
charges
violate
section
1
and
the
summit
holding
the
association
would
break
apart.
and
c&s
and
its
associates,
banks
will
compete
aggressively
with
one
another.
the
assumptions
are
not
proved
anywhere
in
this
record
and
they
are
not
logical.
the
name
and
the
public
identification
would
not
be
removed.
the
associated
operations
would
remain.
the
expectation
of
being
merged
and
the
realization
of
being
part
of
the
c&s
system
would
remain.
the
nature
of
the
competitive
posture
in
the
marketplace
would
not
change.
they
would
continue
to
function
as
c&s
banks
and
the
public
and
the
competitors
would
continue
so
to
see
them
as
they
always
have
and
to
use
them
that
way,
a
single
competitive
force
in
separate
markets
as
they've
always
been.
even
if
the
issuance
of
these
memos
that
so
much
is
made
off,
or
the
obtaining
of
the
information
from
the
c&s
related
to
pricing
and
ours
were
condemned
even
though
it's
used
only
as
a
part
of
a
large
bit
of
information
that
these
small
banks
exercised
to
determine
the
only
competitive
strategy.
that
would
not
affect
the
relationships
not
because
the
conduct
is
in
this
case
trivial
which
it
is,
but
because
the
associate
bank
officers
would
continue
to
determine
their
charges
and
their
rates
independently
with
their
boards
as
they
have
testified
they
now
do.
finally
--
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
oh,
mr.
chief
justice
indeed
they
would
be
capable
of
this
emancipation
as
they
always
have
been.
as
i
believe
in
almost
in
any
similar
circumstances.
but
the
evidence
is
clear
from
all
parties
in
the
pulls
and
the
testimony
was
broad
spread
and
comprehensive
shareholders,
directors,
officers,
employees
everyone
alike
that
there
was
no
probability
of
this.
before
the
fdic
this
question
was
raised.
that's
a
very
tough
agency
over
there
and
they
raised
this
question,
the
probability
of
disaffiliation.
and
we
supplied
tremendous
amounts
of
information
to
demonstrate
that
this
was
though
possible
was
absolutely
improbable
which
is
the
standard
that
this
court
must
apply.
the
same
procedure
was
followed
through
with
the
district
court.
surely,
the
possibility
is
there.
but
this
is
no
stone
mountain
situation.
this
is
no
peachtree
bank
situation.
no
one
wants
them
to
break
apart.
they
all
like
it
like
it
is.
these
are
c&s
banks.
they
are
c&s
banks
just
as
much
as
a
branch
would
have
been,
had
it
been
allowed
to
go
out
there
from
the
beginning.
there
is
absolutely
no
difference,
so
far
as
the
laws
under
which
this
case
has
been
tried
or
concerned.
the
district
court
sir
--
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
restrictions
on
transfer
of
bank
stock?
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect
and
i
can
ensure
your
honor,
so
far
as
i
know
there
are
none.
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
oh,
yes
sir,
yes
sir,
freely
transferable
stock,
no
limitations
and
then
not
let
away
--
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
yes
sir,
but
i
believe--
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
yes
sir.
but
i
believe
that
such
could
have
been
the
case
in
trans
texas
of
course,
which
really
proves
another
point,
stock
ownership
alone
may
not
be
so
strong
a
summit,
in
our
judgment
it's
not
nearly
so
strong
a
submit
as
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
but
--
sir
--
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
yes
sir,
the
economics
of
it.
in
this
case
i
should
say
though
that
the
record
is
clear,
that
there
is
very
little
movement.
there
was
very
their
little
movement
in
sale
to
the
stock
in
the
critical
period.
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
i
don't
believe
much
would
be
sold
if
your
honor
please,
but
it's
totally
hypothetical.
there's
a
series
of
affidavits
in
the
filing
of
this
case
that
we
got
up
with
the
fdic,
and
went
on
and
solicited
all
the
shareholders
and
they
all
affirmed
that
they
like
it
with
c&s
and
they
weren't
interested
in
to
selling
and
they
know
c&s
management
and
they
know
the
success
of
c&s
in
the
state
of
georgia.
they
know
c&s
knows
its
business.
i
really
believe
they
would
not
be
inclined
to
sell.
it's
kind
of
hard
to
roundup
that
kind
of
stock.
most
importantly
as
we
--
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
oh,
if
your
honor
please
of
course
it's
possible.
and
i
could
not
responsibly
stand
here
and
argue
to
the
other
--
to
the
opposite
as
much
as
i
would
be
inclined
to
believe.
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
if
your
honor
please,
there
is
expressed
evidence
in
this
record
to
that
effect.
these
are
the
affidavits
of
the
shareholders
that
we
obtained
that
there
is
suggestion
of
fdic
and
they
were
so
put
before
the
court.
and
that
--
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
b.
hodgson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
again.
may
we
conclude
our
argument
with
respect
to
the
section
7
charges
by
reminding
the
court
that
the
district
court's
finding
just
like
that
of
the
corporation
before
it
foresaw
no
probability
of
a
change
in
the
relationship
which
is
a
finding
exactly
like
that
of
the
district
court
in
general
dynamics
we
submit.
where
the
court
foresaw
no
new
coal
reserves
being
found
and
likewise
that
finding
unless
its
charge
is
being
clearly
erroneous
which
it
has
not
should
be
affirmed
by
this
court.
turning
to
the
sherman
act
charges,
let
me
say
that
it
is
our
strong
view
at
the
outset
that
this
just
is
not
a
sherman
act
case.
and
we
believe
that
through
our
briefs
and
argument
we
can
satisfy
the
court,
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
means
the
department
would
use
in
this
case
to
frustrate
these
mergers.
let
us
look
at
the
charges
that
the
department
makes
as
being
violations.
first,
sort
of
a
two-headed
charge
the
best
we
can
determine
of
a
per
se
violation.
now,
preliminary
maybe
i
say
one
other
thing,
we
are
not
asking
this
court
for
any
exemption
or
pardon
from
any
sherman
act
violations.
but
we
do
urged
this
court
not
to
extend
it's
per
se
doctrine
to
the
totality
of
the
pro-competitive
and
beneficial
behavior
that
the
record
discloses
in
this
case.
and
we
ask
this
court
to
restrict
the
application
of
the
per
se
doctrine
to
such
pernicious
conduct
as
real
price
fixing,
real
market
allocation
and
real
boycotts.
otherwise,
it
is
so
extended.
it
occurs
to
us
would
require
that
a
merger
agreement
itself
would
become
a
per
se
violation
and
obviously
that
cannot
be
the
case.
now,
we
would
think
that
a
real
per
se
violation
is
glaringly
evident
to
anyone
especially
to
the
public
officers
charged
with
enforcing
those
laws
and
to
the
competitors
of
the
charge
defenders.
we
all
know
that's
where
they
are
first
ascertained.
they
were
and
they
are
glaringly
and
immediately
evident
in
all
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
department
to
prove
conspiracy
in
the
absence
of
an
expressed
agreement.
why?
because
the
behavior
reflected
in
the
records
in
those
cases,
so
clearly
reflect
a
clear,
flagrant,
naked
and
offensive
purpose
and
effect,
either
to
fix
prices,
to
restrain
trade,
to
allocate
markets
to
customers
or
eliminate
competition.
there
is
none
such
here
much
less
a
combination
of
separate
firms
to
maintain
prices
above
a
competitive
figure,
a
classic
definition
of
a
cartel.
now,
if
a
per
se
violation
exists
by
virtue
of
the
totality
of
behavior
that
was
openly
involved
in
the
associations
of
this
case,
well
known
to
the
regulators
and
the
public
alike.
why
did
not
the
department
see
it
and
at
least
call
attention
to
it
when
they
participated
in
1968
now,
in
the
federal
reserve
board
hearing.
it
can
only
be
because
it
was
not
perceived
as
such.
it
simply
wasn't
recognized
as
such.
and
we
cannot
perceive
it
as
such
today.
it
was
to
this
very
argument
i
make
that
the
district
court
found.
the
department
of
justice
acquiescence
in
1968
in
an
understanding
involving
the
more
substantial
elements
of
what
it
now
claims
to
be
section
1
violations
is
indicative
to
at
least
a
smaller
degree
that
such
practices
were
not
so
violently
anticompetitive
as
to
constitute
per
se
violations.
in
action,
the
district
court
said
by
the
department
of
justice
with
such
a
knowledge
would
have
been
a
violation
of
each
public
duty
and
the
court
does
not
impute
such
negligent
in
action
to
it
nor
do
we.
the
very
same
associations,
the
very
same
transactions
involved
in
this
case
with
this
five
banks
was
involved
in
1969
with
the
acquisition
of
a
small
bank,
all
the
c&s
belvidere
bank.
what
did
the
department
perceive
then,
sherman
act
violations?
not
a
one
and
yet
we
must
concede
that
none
were
perceived
because
the
factors
were
the
same.
and
the
department
noted
that
the
citizens
and
southern
holding
company
has
had
full
management
control
of
belvidere
bank
since
its
inception.
going
on
to
say,
the
situation
is
not
unlike
de
novo
branch
banking
in
those
states
where
such
activity
is
lawful.
the
department
noted
no
violations
in
its
first
competitive
report
in
this
case.
when
it
noted
the
reorganizations
were
essentially
internal
and
the
parties
had
never
represented
independent
competitive
forces.
a
competitive
posture
of
the
department
now
says
that
c&s
and
its
associates
in
separate
markets
must
take
toward
each
other
just
for
one
reason
only,
just
because
they
are
organized
in
the
form
of
separate
corporate
bodies.
and
even
when
the
department
reversed
its
competitive
position
letter,
in
february
of
‘71
it
did
so
not
on
the
grounds
that
the
relationship
and
the
behavior
between
the
persons
violated
the
sherman
act
because
of
the
very
opposite,
it
concluded
that
the
associated
banks
were
not
necessarily
controlled
by
c&s.
now,
we've
never
understood
the
consistency
of
the
department's
position
with
respect
to
our
transactions,
but
that's
really
beside
the
point.
we
want
to
make
it
clear
today
that
we
do
not
charge
the
department
with
bad
faith
on
the
contrary
and
we
surely
do
not
claim
an
estoppel,
i
doubt
it
would
be
available.
but
we
cite
this
instances
to
clearly
and
unequivocally
demonstrate
that
no
sherman
act
violations
were
apparent
even
to
the
expert
eye.
in
the
sponsorship
and
managerial
relationships
that
are
part
of
these
associations
much
less
per
se
violations,
if
not
then
not
now.
indeed,
the
first
time
that
the
chairman
was
charged
was
in
the
complaint
denominated
vaguely
a
close
working
relationship.
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
to
this
court,
the
charge
became
interchanges
of
information
personnel
and
other
resources
leading
to
lack
of
competition.
we
say
there
never
was
any,
you
could
not
lead
to
it,
if
there
never
was
any.
the
ingredients
of
a
per
se
charge
did
not
even
then
appear
and
the
nature
of
the
restraint
did
not
appear.
only
in
the
brief
before
this
court
did
we
first
hear
that
we
were
charged
with
a
per
se
violation.
the
brief
says
in
one
place,
not
merely
the
exchange
of
past
price
information
which
affects
current
pricing
practices
that's
contained
on
its
progeny,
but
a
mutual
understanding
to
fix
actual
current
prices
a
classic
per
se
offense.
citing
socony-vacuum
and
park
davis,
not
even
the
most
biased
reading
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
will
reflect
a
single
factual
circumstance
similar
to
socony-vacuum
and
park
davis
or
any
of
the
other
per
se
cases
cited.
masonite,
baush
&
lomb,
keefer
stuart,
general
motors,
celine,
permalife,
they
are
all
flagrant
violations,
clearly
so.
and
everyone
of
the
sets
and
circumstances
in
those
cases,
the
sole
purpose
and
the
overwhelming
effect
was
to
fix
prizes,
really
fix
them
to
maintain
markets,
allocate
customers.
its
strange
reason
to
suggest
that
the
relationships
here
between
c&s
and
its
associated
banks
that
it
formed,
many
of
these
services
at
the
heart
of
the
correspondent
bank
relationship,
many
of
them
essential
to
franchise
dealings.
many
of
them
the
focal
part
of
management
consultation
services,
indeed
anyone's
imagination
familiar
with
the
commercial
world
can
come
up
with
many
similarities
to
these
sorts
of
relationships.
all
of
them
in
this
case
calculated
to
supply
new
competitive
forces
to
new
markets.
and
if
it's
followed
by
such
advice
as
to
make
the
successful
operation
of
these
little
banks
as
associated
competitors
in
their
separate
markets,
it's
strange
reason
to
suggest
that
such
relationships
could
possibly
be
found
to
be
conspiracies
in
restraint
of
trade
much
less
of
such
predatory
and
unconscionable
character
so
lacking
in
redeeming
virtue.
that
is
to
allow
no
inquiry
into
the
purpose
or
effect
or
the
reason
to
administer
of
the
association.
a
conclusion
entirely
necessary
for
there
being
categorized
per
se.
take
the
entire
relationship
as
an
onion.
peel
back
the
layers
of
explicit
behavior.
even
the
department
admitted
here
today
that
each
layer
standing
alone
is
no
violation
possibly
the
pricing
memoranda
which
we
will
come
to.
yet
somehow
the
whole
onion
taken
together
becomes
a
cartel.
use
of
the
common
name
is
no
violation.
this
court
has
allowed
this
in
topco.
loose
common
ownership
over
the
bulk
of
the
stock
is
no
violation,
trans
texas
and
many
others.
non
stabilizing
furnishing
of
price
information
is
not
a
per
se
violation
container
and
progeny.
surely
the
supply
of
personnel,
operational,
security,
accounting
and
all
of
the
other
services
cannot
be
violations
of
the
sherman
act.
anyone
with
the
time
and
this
court
hasn't
the
time
i
fear,
but
anyone
with
the
time
going
through
two
volumes
of
a
joint
appendix,
the
consumer
credit
guide
that
inadvertently
got
in
the
record,
but
i'm
glad
it's
there
now.
if
you
have
time
in
some
through
two
volumes
being
just
the
consumer
credit
guide
look
at
the
multitude
of
information
that
has
to
be
available
to
a
young
bank,
a
small
bank
in
order
to
compete
in
today's
complex
highly
regulated
market.
how
can
this
be
a
per
se
violation?
the
district
court
found
it
non-violative
and
should
be
affirmed.
but
now
the
department
charges
that
certain
memoranda
circulated
to
five
percent
banks
and
incidentally
everyone
else
in
the
system
relating
to
rates,
charges
and
hours
were
conclusive
evidence
of
price
fixing
and
therefore
a
per
se
violation.
now,
if
it
were
the
law,
if
it
were
the
law,
that
the
existence
of
such
memoranda
standing
alone
creates
an
irrebuttable
presumption
of
price
fixing
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act
then
coupled
with
authorities
holding
that
a
per
se
violation
is
such
a
violation
as
can
have
no
redeeming
virtues,
the
district
court
would
summarily
have
found
that
this
particular
behavior
was
unlawful
and
he
would
have
enjoined
it.
he
found
to
the
contrary.
we
know
of
no
law
or
decision
further
that
says
that
such
memoranda
standing
alone
create
an
irrebuttable
presumption
that
a
conspiracy
to
fix
prices
exists.
or
that
any
other
per
se
violation
has
been
proved.
further,
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
these
memoranda
alone
are
but
a
small
and
unimportant
aspect
of
the
entire
relationship
between
c&s
and
its
associates
much
more
important
to
the
branch
banks
to
which
they
went.
and
their
prohibition
would
in
no
way
if
you
would
eliminate
them
all
affect
the
closeness
of
the
relationships
or
the
propriety
of
the
acquisitions.
what
rational
purpose
could
have
been
served
by
c&s
and
these
associated
banks
making
an
agreement
or
having
a
tacit
understanding
to
fix
prices
in
these
separate
markets.
the
department
has
suggested
none
and
we
can
conceive
of
none.
we
can
only
believe
that
it
would
be
harmful.
there
was
no
evidence
whatever
that
the
occasional
transmissions
of
this
information
relative
to
price
in
anyway
resulted
in
stabilization.
now,
c&s
in
its
system
has
always
been
extremely
conservative
and
cautious
about
the
sherman
act.
and
although
one
could
well
make
an
argument
that
this
being
a
single
enterprise,
sorts
of
conduct
that
are
generally
prosecutable
under
this
act
couldn't
occur.
but
to
be
doubly
cautious
memoranda
have
been
consistently
going
out
in
the
end
of
this
record
obliging
separate
entities
to
make
their
pricing
and
their
charging
decisions
separately
and
independently
all
were
reminded
frequently
of
the
criminal
illegality
of
agreements
between
banks
relating
to
prices.
and
everyone
who's
testimony
was
taken
in
this
case
without
exception.
the
testimony
of
every
principal
officer
of
the
five
percent
banks,
of
directors
of
the
five
percent
banks,
said
that
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
we
set
our
own
pricing
standards
and
our
own
charges.
sure,
we
use
the
c&s
information
it
was
handy
and
they're
pretty
good
too.
and
we
took
that
into
account.
but
we
also
probe
the
competition.
we
took
the
various
financial
journals.
we
knew
what
was
going
on
at
the
fed
and
we
knew
what
was
going
on
particularly
with
respect
to
our
competitors
and
then
we
set
our
prices.
furthermore,
a
close
look
at
the
evidence
discloses
that
while
the
government
points
an
accusatory
finger
at
these
memos
which
standing
alone
might
have
been
a
circumstance
that
could
lead
to
a
determination
that
you
had
a
violation.
it
neglects
to
note
that
his
memoranda
were
but
the
smallest
part
of
the
whole
continuing
advisory
service
to
all
branches
affiliates
and
associates,
fails
to
note
that
the
information
contained
in
these
memos
was
only
a
portion
of
the
market
and
information
obtained
by
the
associate
banks
in
setting
their
prices.
fails
to
note
that
there
is
a
multitude
of
evidence
that
all
of
these
men,
well
knew
what
the
service
charges
deposed
on
deposit
accounts
and
the
interest
paid
on
savings
account
were
among
all
of
the
competition.
and
changes
of
such
rates
and
changes
of
such
deposit
charges
are
typically
announced
in
full
paid
newspaper
adds
and
radio
and
tv
spots.
they
are
no
secret.
the
department
fails
to
observe
that
the
evidence
is
clear
in
this
case
that
shows
extreme
variations
of
rates
charged
on
the
loans.
and
substantial
variations
on
service
charges
and
interest
paid
as
between
the
c&s
and
its
associates.
now,
mr.
friedman
has
argued
about
mr.
harris
testimony
about
consulting
downtown
about
something.
allow
me,
if
i
may
to
give
you
some
other
of
his
evidence.
and
the
best
way
i
know
to
do
is
to
put
this
to
you
this
way
and
if
you
have
time
to
read
the
depositions
of
each
of
the
bank
officers
of
these
little
banks,
it
would
be
extremely
profitable.
you
will
see
that
this
is
a
charge
without
substance.
question
to
mr.
harris,
how
did
you
decide
on
the
initial
service
charges
on
checking
accounts
when
the
bank
opened?
we
took
those
that
were
used
by
every
bank
in
atlanta
(inaudible).
question,
before
making
a
change
in
service
charges
on
checking
account,
would
you
also
review
that
with
c&s?
yes,
we
would,
but
we
would
have
to
review
more
with
the
area
generally
than
to
just
c&s.
because
i
can't
have
a
charge
out
there
that
varies
too
widely
from
the
other
banks.
because
people
move
their
account
from
one
bank,
after
all,
all
the
banks
have
offices
around
there.
i've
got
to
stay
pretty
close
to
what
the
downtown
banks
charge.
i
used
c&s
every
way
possible
to
help
in
making
decisions.
i
confer
with
them
on
many
points.
then
we
discuss
it
with
the
directors
and
we
try
to
get
all
the
information
from
whatever
source
we
could.
we
took
every
banking
magazine,
periodic,
trying
to
stay
abreast
of
what
was
going
on.
so
that
with
many
of
those
things
that
was
just
part
of
the
movement
in
the
money
market
and
you
had
to
follow
it.
this
testimony
is
not
just
an
earnest
denial
of
no
violation
or
no
unlawful
conduct.
it's
an
honest
report
of
telling
it
like
it
is.
information
obtained
from
c&s
along
with
information
that
obtained
from
many
other
sources,
competitors,
the
market
journals
and
publications
was
used
to
arrive
that
independently
established
rates,
charges,
and
hours.
i
would
not
have
mentioned
this
but
mr.
friedman
makes
much
of
what
we
thought
we'd
put
to
rest
in
our
brief
this
morning.
the
change
by
all
of
these
banks
suddenly
to
a
lower
service
charge.
he
didn't
mention
it
was
lower
but
it
was.
now,
the
testimony
is
clear
and
it's
specifically
referred
to
in
our
brief
that
here's
what
happened.
trust
company
of
georgia,
a
major
competitor
came
out
with
full
page
ad
one
day,
that
said
“we
are
reducing
the
service
charge
on
our
deposit
accounts
from
a
minimum
of
500
to
a
minimum
of
250.”
well,
now
what
do
you
think
everyone
did
when
they
saw
that?
they
said,
“good
lord,
they
are
going
to
take
all
our
account.
we
got
to
find
out
about
this.”
and
they
all
scattered
around
and
found
out
what
happened.
what
did
c&s
do?
now,
c&s
has
a
more
significant
research
department
than
to
the
five
percent
banks.
it
determined
that
this
could
be
done
without
a
significant
threat
to
the
profitability
of
the
operation
of
this
deposit
accounts
and
it's
so
advised
everybody.
so
what
did
they
do?
they
met
the
competition
of
the
lower
service
charge.
now
that's
what
happened
in
this
case
if
you
really
examine
the
record.
i
do
not
believe
that
that
is
a
sort
of
thing
that
this
court
is
going
to
condemn
as
a
per
se
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
the
department
has
cited
no
authority
that
requires
that
these
behaviors
either
the
entire
associate
relationship
with
the
furnishing
of
these
memos
be
found
the
violation
of
the
sherman
act
much
less
per
se,
nor
that
the
facts
permit
such
a
conclusion
had
the
district
court
been
so
inclined.
we
would
have
been
here
on
the
appellant's
side.
but
instead
the
district
court
found,
these
activities
however
do
not
amount
to
collusive
price
fixing.
if
there
is
no
per
se
violation
then
the
question
becomes
how
the
party
is
so
combined
as
to
produce
an
unreasonable
restraint.
the
department
argues
just
because
apparently,
just
because
they
are
incorporated
separately,
they
are
obligated
to
compete
vigorously
or
at
least
the
c&s
should
abandon
the
sponsored
bank.
no
authorities
have
cited
for
this
proposition.
and
totally
ignores
the
single
reason
for
the
choice
of
the
separate
corporate
form
which
turns
out
to
be
a
nuisance.
that
is
to
avoid
the
restrictive
state
branching
laws
that
prevented
c&s
from
competing.
the
only
response
the
department
produces
to
fill
the
void
of
any
legal
mandate
for
c&s
to
compete
with
its
own
associates
consistent
cases
holding
first,
if
the
corporate
relationships
are
not
determinative
of
the
applicability
of
the
act,
it
suits
us,
or
second
where
corporately
related
entities
combined
to
enter
in
to
expressed
agreements
to
commit
naked
per
se
violations
of
the
sherman
act
by
fixing
prices
and
allocate
territories
in
markets.
while
holding
themselves
out
to
be
competitors
with
one
another,
they
will
not
be
able
to
allowed
to
defend
behind
the
veil
of
corporate
separateness.
it
would
not
well
serve
antitrust
principles
to
leap
from
authorities
which
condemn
flagrant
and
clear
violations
which
would
defend
it
only
by
a
plea
of
common
ownership.
that
was
the
only
defense
to
a
condemnation
of
the
entirely
beneficial
and
pro-competitive
associations
of
this
case
because
the
entities
are
separate
informed.
the
department
asks
this
court
to
pronounce
an
unreasonable
commitment
to
form
over
substance.
in
area
traditionally
devoted
to
substance
over
form.
a
totally
novel
doctrine
that
would
require
one
company
and
its
de
facto
subsidiary
held
out
to
the
public
to
be
a
subsidiary
with
the
same
name
aggressively
to
compete
with
one
another.
is
it
being
asked
to
beat
it,
it's
a
little
prodigies
brings
out
with
vigorous
competition,
confusing
the
public,
delighting
the
competition
and
amazing
them
somewhat.
infuriating
the
regulators
who
had
depended
upon
c&s
to
furnish
this
service,
betraying
the
shareholders,
officers
and
employees
of
the
sponsored
bank
and
destroying
the
bank
of
what
purpose
would
this
sponsorship
be
under
those
circumstances.
what
would
be
left
with
which
ultimately
to
merge
or
should
it
be
supported
and
competed
with
the
same
time.
or
should
there
be
maybe
just
a
little
bit
of
competition
enough
to
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door.
there
is
no
element
of
reality
in
this
position.
what
rational
expensive
mandate,
but
well
managed
bank
holding
company
would
follow
such
a
course.
how
would
it
ever
develop
that
this
bank
could
be
merged?
we
urge
this
court
also
to
recognize
that
no
floodgate
of
adverse
circumstances
would
occur
if
this
court
affirms.
this
plan
--
this
unique
plan,
no
precedent
or
anything
else
would
take
place.
and
finally
this
can't
ordinarily
happen
again.
if
someone
wants
to
go
to
this
procedure
again
they
have
got
to
go
to
the
fed
under
section
382
and
after
making
application
get
approval
for
the
formation
of
subsidiary
with
the
department
notifier
who
can
come
in
and
participate.
if
they
don't
like
it
they
can
file
a
petition
for
review
to
the
nearest
circuit
court.
no
floodgates
will
be
open,
only
beneficial
results
will
occur
here.
and
this
unique
little
case
will
take
its
place
on
the
dusty
shelf
of
this
court
and
i
dare
say
never
be
looked
at
again.
thank
you
your
honor.
