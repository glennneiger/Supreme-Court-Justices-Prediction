did
the
fdic
state
reasons
mr.
friedman
for
rejecting
as
to
the
sixth
bank?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
government
here
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
situation
would
different
after
the
acquisition
that
it
was
under
the
five
percent
arrangement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
does
the
language
lessening
competition
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
see
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying
thereby
putting
it
into
a
hypothetical
case
mr.
friedman.
are
you
suggesting
that
one
of
these
five
percent
banks
may
conceivably
be
located
in
an
area
that
experienced
a
sudden
growth
and
great
deal
of
business
and
finally
concluded,
its
directors
concluded,
that
it
could
stand
on
its
feet,
independent
of
any
relationship
or
guidance
or
help
from
the
home
office
and
then
they
would
regard
themselves
as
emancipated?
even
though
the
atlanta
bank
owned
five
percent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
the
kind
of
situation
you
are
talking
about
that
you
think
the
antitrust
law
must
reach
this
in
its
incipiency?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman
suppose
and
this
is
not
hypothetical,
but
it
involves
your
projection.
suppose
you
had
not
taken
an
appeal
here
at
all.
and
five
years
from
now,
the
fears
which
you
have
expressed
or
the
concerns
about
lessening
competition
were
demonstrable
in
the
view
of
the
antitrust
division,
would
you
be
in
a
position
to
move
in
at
that
time
and
seek
a
divestiture?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
to
what
point
now
do
you
direct
these
examples
mr.
friedman?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
speaking
of
the
past
situation
aren't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
five
percent
arrangement.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
that
not
also
suggest,
doesn't
that
lessen
the
distinction
that
you
were
previously
making
between
the
situation
as
it
was
and
the
situation
as
it
will
be
after
the
acquisition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you're
narrowing
the
gap
when
you
press
that
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
saying
that
each
of
these
five
percent
situations
was
violation
or
only
that
taken
all
together
against
this
whole
background?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hodgson.
chief

franchisees?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
it
be
--
they
would
be
capable
of
the
--
this
emancipation
that
i
discussed
with
mr.
friedman,
would
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
a
hypothetical
bank
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
i
think
asked
you
about
the
bank
over
in
birmingham
closely
set
out
on
a
plan
to
buy
above
the
stock
that's
got
available
in
anyone
of
these
five
banks,
against
the
possibility
that
one
day
they
might
want
to
enter
that
market.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
also
very
difficult
hypothetical
question
for
you
to
answer
to
me,
because
it
is
possible
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
resume
there
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hodgson
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
friedman
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
friedman.
thank
you
mr.
hodgson.
the
case
is
submitted.
