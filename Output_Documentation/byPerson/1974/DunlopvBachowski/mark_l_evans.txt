mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
under
title
iv
of
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act,
the
secretary
of
labor
has
given
exclusive
authority
to
file
a
civil
action
to
set
aside
an
election
--
union
election
conducted
in
violation
of
the
provisions
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
this
case
held
that
an
unsuccessful
union
office
seeker
though
barred
by
the
act
from
being
in
action
in
his
own
name
to
set
aside
the
election
may
bring
an
action
against
the
union
and
the
secretary
of
labor
to
compel
the
secretary
to
file
a
suit
even
though
the
secretary
had
already
determined
after
an
investigation
that
the
members
complaint
was
unmeritorious.
the
case
arose
on
a
complaint
file
with
the
secretary
by
respondent
bachowski
alleging
that
there
were
violations
in
the
conduct
of
an
election
in
which
he
run
unsuccessfully
for
the
position
of
district
director
of
a
united
steelworkers
district.
at
about
the
same
time,
complaints
were
filed
with
respect
--
excuse
me,
to
elections
in
five
other
steelworkers
districts
and
after
an
investigation
of
each
complaint,
the
secretary
filed
suit
to
set
aside
two
of
those
elections,
but
he
determined
not
to
file
a
suit
in
the
case
of
bachowski's
district
because
he
concluded
on
the
basis
of
his
investigation
that
the
violations
in
that
district
did
not
affect
the
outcome
of
the
election.
bachowski
then
brought
the
present
action
in
the
district
court
alleging
that
the
violations
did
affect
the
outcome
and
that
the
secretary's
refusal
to
bring
an
action
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
the
complaint
sought
an
order
compelling
the
secretary
to
bring
an
action
in
his
name
to
set
aside
the
election
and
directing
the
secretary
in
the
union
to
extend
the
statutory
60-day
period
within
which
the
secretary
may
file
such
an
action.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
jurisdictional
grounds
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
that
the
factual
basis
for
the
secretary's
determination
that
the
violations
did
not
affect
the
outcome
of
the
election
is
subject
to
judicial
review
at
the
behest
of
the
union
member
whose
complaint
was
deemed
by
the
secretary
to
be
unmeritorious.
that
holding
in
our
view
was
inconsistent
with
the
enforcement
scheme
of
title
iv
of
the
act
because
it
would
permit
a
complaining
union
member
to
circumvent
the
secretary's
screening
function
under
the
act
and
subject
the
union
to
precisely
the
sort
of
intrusion
upon
its
internal
affairs
that
the
act
was
so
carefully
designed
to
prevent.
the
mechanism
that
was
established
by
congress
to
enforce
the
election
rights
guaranteed
under
title
iv
reflects
a
delicate
balance
between
the
need
under
one
hand
to
provide
effective
remedies
for
election
abuses
and
the
congressional
concern
on
the
other
hand
to
avoid
unnecessary
interference
in
internal
union
affairs.
congress
feared
that
needless
intervention
might
endanger
union
self
government
and
weaken
the
unions
and
their
role
as
bargaining
representatives.
in
the
course
of
considering
the
act
that
ultimately
was
passed,
the
congress
considered
and
rejected
a
number
of
proposals
that
would
have
authorized
individual
union
members
to
bring
suits
to
set
aside
an
election.
it
was
thought
that
such
individual
suits
filed
perhaps
by
union
or
unsuccessful
candidates
is
a
kind
of
continuation
of
pre-election
in
fighting
would
impose
upon
the
unions
the
substantial
burden
of
responding
to
unmeritorious
and
potentially
harassing
complaints
and
would
place
in
the
process
a
debilitating
cloud
over
the
title
of
the
elected
officers.
in
the
end,
congress
chose
to
rely
upon
the
discretion
and
expertise
of
the
secretary
of
labor
to
perform
a
dispassionate
screening
function
separating
out
the
meritorious
from
the
unmeritorious
complaints
and
filing
an
action
in
his
name
with
respect
to
those
complains
that
he
found
to
be
meritorious.
the
individual's
role
in
this
enforcement
scheme
is
an
essential
but
a
very
limited
one.
he
triggers
the
secretary's
investigative
and
enforcement
authority.
without
his
complaint,
the
secretary
can
take
no
action
but
ones
the
secretary's
authority
has
been
invoked,
he
and
he
alone
has
the
power
to
bring
an
action
against
the
union
to
set
aside
the
election
within
60
days
of
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed
and
then
only
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
both
that
violations
occurred
in
the
conduct
of
the
election
and
that
those
violations
may
have
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
this
court
accordingly
held
in
the
calhoon
case
that
the
act
prohibits
union
members
from
instituting
a
private
suit
to
set
aside
an
election.
the
intention
of
congress
was
to
interpose
the
secretary
between
the
complaining
member
and
the
courtroom
in
order
to
protect
unions
from
potentially
frivolous
litigation
and
a
consequent
unnecessary
interference
with
their
internal
functions.
as
this
court
stated
in
trbovich,
the
intention
was
to
insolate
the
union
from
any
complaint
that
does
not
appear
meritorious
both
to
the
complaining
union
member
and
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
court
held
in
trbovich
that
the
acts
objectives
would
not
be
defeated
by
permitting
the
member
to
intervene
in
an
action
already
initiated
by
the
secretary,
so
long
as
that
intervention
were
limited
to
issues
presented
in
the
secretary's
complaint.
the
court
also
held
that
the
intervening
member
may
not
add
issues
which
he
originally
complained
of
to
the
secretary
but
which
the
secretary
found
unmeritorious
because
that
would
be
a
circumvention
of
the
very
screening
function
that
have
been
assigned
under
the
act
to
the
secretary.
in
our
view,
the
third
circuit's
holding
in
the
present
case
would
permit
a
much
more
burdensome
intrusion
than
the
one
that
the
court
held
impermissible
in
trbovich
and
that
it
would
even
more
clearly
allow
a
member
to
circumvent
the
secretary's
screening
function.
although
a
suit
to
review
the
secretary's
determination
that
litigation
is
unwarranted
would
inform
perhaps
be
a
suit
against
the
secretary
of
labor,
the
union
might
well
be
named
the
defendant
as
indeed,
the
union
was
named
the
defendant
in
this
case.
but
even
if
it
were
not
named,
it
would
as
a
practical
matter
essential
for
the
union
to
participate
presumably
as
an
intervener
but
no
less
than
as
an
amicus.
in
order
to
protect
its
rights
in
this
what
would
amount
to
the
critical
stage
of
the
litigation.
the
consequences
of
a
determination
that
the
secretary's
refusal
to
file
suit
was
so
improperly
based
as
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious
would
obviously
be
damaging
in
the
immediate
future
because
a
suit
would
presumably
be
filed
by
the
secretary
but
in
the
long
run
because
the
issues
had
been
fully
adjudicated
on
a
different
burden
through
but
fully
adjudicated
in
the
first
action.
and
in
the
course
of
this
proceeding,
while
the
issue
presumably
as
the
propriety
of
the
secretary's
investigation
and
decision
making
with
respect
to
this
particular
complaint,
it's
inevitable
that
among
the
issues
that
it's
going
to
be
inquired
into
is
the
validity
of
the
election
itself,
which
is
really
the
ultimate
way
you
test
to
see
whether
the
secretary's
decision
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
as
the
court
ultimately
held
that
the
secretary
abused
his
discretion
in
failing
to
bring
an
action
on
the
member's
complaint,
the
union
would
be
at
that
point
require
either
to
try
to
persuade
the
same
judge
if
it
came
before
the
same
judge
that
he
was
wrong
in
the
first
place
or
if
a
different
judge
were
assigned
to
the
case,
the
union
will
have
to
put
on
its
whole
case
again.
that
double
burden
is
far
greater
than
the
burden
congress
thought
it
was
imposing
on
the
unions
even
if
the
court
found
as
it
probably
would
that
the
secretary's
action
were
not
arbitrary
and
capricious,
the
union
would
still
have
been
put
to
substantially
the
same
burden
in
participating
in
this
suit
to
review
the
secretary's
determination
that
it
would
have
been
put
to
if
individual
member
could
have
filed
on
his
own.
it
is
the
same
burden
that
congress
was
legislating
against
the
burden
of
responding
to
potentially
frivolous
and
harassing
complaints.
in
the
end,
no
matter
what
result
the
district
court
reaches
on
the
member's
suit
to
review
the
secretary's
determinations,
the
elected
officers
of
the
union
would
during
the
period
of
this
litigation
presumably
subsequent
appeals
be
functioning
under
a
cloud
upon
their
title
to
office.
that
alone
we
submit
would
substantially
defeat
the
acts
policy
of
requiring
prompt
resolution
of
election
disputes
precisely
to
free
the
elected
officials
from
the
debilitating
effects
of
a
continuing
doubt
as
to
their
legitimacy.
the
result
in
some
is
substantially
the
result
that
congress
sought
to
prohibit
in
giving
the
secretary
the
exclusive
authority
to
bring
a
post
election
lawsuit.
unions
under
the
third
circuit's
rule
could
be
held
into
court
without
limitation,
they
would
be
subject
to
potentially
frivolous
complaints
and
the
secretary's
authority
to
insolate
the
union
from
those
complaints
and
from
an
unnecessary
interference
with
their
internal
affairs
would
be
wholly
emasculated.
his
screening
function
in
effect
would
be
transferred
to
the
courts.
the
court
of
appeals'
response
to
this
argument
which
respondent
1122
in
its
brief
appears
at
pages
9
(a)
to
11
(a)
of
the
petition
of
the
government,
the
appendix
for
petition
of
the
government.
the
court
stated
first
that
a
suit
to
review
the
secretary's
decision
not
to
sue
would
not
subject
unions
to
unnecessary
interference
because
the
secretary's
decision
would
be
overturn
only
when
there
was
a
compelling
showing
that
he
ignored
a
meritorious
complaint,
but
to
say
that
there
would
be
a
heavy
burden
upon
the
complaining
member
does
not
negate
the
intrusion.
the
interference
is
not
simply
the
ultimate
danger
of
having
the
election
overturn
but
the
very
process
of
the
judicial
review
which
necessarily
entails
a
response
to
claims
that
the
election
was
invalid.
congress
recognized
that
a
union's
internal
affairs
are
intruded
upon
and
its
resources
are
taxed
whenever
it
is
held
into
court
to
defendants
election
and
that
is
why
it
sought
to
insolate
the
union
from
frivolous
complaints
if
the
only
worry
were
the
ultimate
overturning
of
the
election,
there
would
have
been
no
need
to
insolate
the
union
from
frivolous
complaints.
so
the
burden
of
proof
makes
no
difference
in
the
ultimate
burden
upon
--
and
the
ultimate
damage
to
the
union.
second,
the
court
stated
that
unions
would
remain
protected
from
frivolous
claims
because
the
secretary
would
bare
the
primary
responsibility
for
defending
against
the
suit
to
compel
the
suit.
what
is
unrealistic
i
submit
to
suppose
that
the
union
would
not
actively
participate
in
support
of
its
own
elections
and
since
any
dissatisfied
member
could
presumably
under
the
third
circuits
ruling
bring
a
collateral
action
of
the
sort
that
was
brought
by
mr.
bachowski
here.
no
matter
how
unmeritorious
his
complaint,
there
would
be
no
protection
at
all.
the
union's
theoretical
right
to
let
the
secretary
carry
the
weight
of
a
litigation
is
not
likely
to
be
invoked
simply
because
there
is
too
much
at
stake
for
the
union.
third,
the
court
stated
that
in
--
a
subsequent
suit
by
the
secretary
of
the
member's
collateral
attack
were
successful
would
be
centralized
in
a
single
proceeding
that
i
conceive
as
an
effort
to
satisfy
the
second
of
the
purposes
that
this
court
stated
in
trbovich,
which
was
meant
--
in
trbovich
was
meant
to
be
served
by
the
enforcement
scheme
that
is
to
centralize
in
a
single
proceeding
such
litigation
has
might
be
warranted.
but
that
itself
is
in
substantial
doubt.
presumably
a
member
who
brings
this
suite
to
review
the
secretary's
decision
not
to
sue
could
file
it
either
in
washington
d.c.
or
in
his
home
district.
the
secretary
is
limited
under
the
statute
to
suing
the
union
if
he
ultimately
brings
a
suit
in
the
headquarters
of
the
union
in
this
district
in
which
the
union
headquarters
is
located.
so
there's
no
guarantee
that
we're
going
to
be
--
you
know,
this
sets
--
this
new
proceeding
is
going
to
be
even
in
the
same
court.
but
even
if
it
were,
it
creates
problems
i've
alluded
to
earlier.
if
it
comes
before
the
same
judge,
the
judge
is
mine,
is
essentially
made
up
and
said
next
to
impossible
burden
for
the
union
in
the
second
proceeding
to
adequately
hope
to
defend
itself.
and
if
it
goes
to
a
second
judge,
the
union
has
to
put
on
the
second
round
of
defense.
finally,
on
page
11
(a)
the
court
minimized
the
damaging
effect
of
a
--
on
a
union
of
having
to
function
under
cloud
on
the
title
of
the
officers.
in
its
view
that
concern
maybe
subordinated
to
the
goal
of
providing
an
effective
remedy
for
election
of
regularities,
but
congress
though
differently,
it
subordinated
that
concern
only
to
the
extent
provided
in
the
act.
although
the
courts
have
properly
permitted
the
secretary
to
bring
an
action
outside
the
60-day
period,
when
the
union
itself
has
waived
the
60-day
period
or
where
the
union
itself
has
obstructed
the
investigation.
that
that
kind
of
estoppel
isn't
present
here
and
those
brief
delays
are
incomparable
to
the
obviously
lengthy
delays
that
would
be
involved
here,
it
maybe
months
or
years
before
the
secretary
ultimately
files
the
complaint
if
the
court
tells
him
he
has
to.
and
of
course,
during
all
that
time,
the
union
members,
the
elected
officers
would
be
suffering
under
this
doubt
as
to
the
legitimacy.
respondent
argues
that
trbovich
doesn't
control
this
case
because
the
issue
of
reviewability
was
not
presented
in
that
case
and
i
think
strictly
speaking,
he's
right.
the
court
held
only
that
the
intervening
member
could
not
raise
additional
issues
that
were
not
deemed
meritorious
by
the
secretary.
but
on
respondent's
theory,
trbovich,
though
barred
from
raising
those
additional
issues
as
an
intervener
in
the
secretary's
action
could
have
simply
gone
out
and
started
the
separate
proceeding
to
review
the
secretary's
refusal
to
include
those
issues
in
his
own
proceeding.
that
would
surely
have
been
more
burdensome
to
the
union,
more
cumbersome
to
the
courts
and
i
think
much
more
damaging
to
the
acts
policies
than
simply
presenting
the
new
issues
in
the
on
going
proceeding.
while
the
court
in
trbovich
did
not
concededly
expressly
consider
whether
this
collateral
review
proceeding
would
be
proper,
there
can't
be
much
doubt
how
that
issue
should
be
resolved
in
light
of
the
principles
of
trbovich.
a
suit
to
review
with
the
secretary's
determination
would
effectively
circumvent
the
secretary's
screening
function
and
just
like
the
new
issue
intervention
in
trbovich
and
just
like
the
separate
suit
in
calhoon,
a
suit
to
review
the
secretary's
decision
not
to
sue
is
barred
by
the
act.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
either
that
there's
not
a
violation
of
the
act
or
that
the
violation
did
not
affect
--
there's
not
enough
probable
cause
to
believe
there
that
it
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
and
that's
not
explicit
in
the
statute
but
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no
it's
not,
but
this
court
has
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
appears
in
the
legislative
history,
it
appears
in
this
court's
decisions
and
it's
been
uniform
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
it
is
on
its
face
--
mr.
mark

well,
we're
not
saying
as
unlimited
discretion.
we're
saying
as
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
unreviewable
discretion
and
there's
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
--
a
difference.
there's
a
substantial
difference.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
if
you
read
the
brief,
a
lot
of
my
argument
it'll

well,
the
legislative
history
i'm
referring
to
mr.
justice
white,
it's
very
explicit
in
the
section
by
section
analysis
in
both
the
senate
reports.
it
states
and
indeed
that
was
quoted
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
hotel
employees
decision
i
believe.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
--
.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
precisely,
now,
that's
really
--
that
issue
is
an
important
issue
i
think
but
i
--
it
really
isn't
even
in
this
case
because
there's
no
question
that
the
secretary
here
found
that
there
was
violations
that
did
not
affect
the
outcome
of
the
election.
now,
if
he
had
relied
on
some
collateral
factors,
we
might
be
in,
i'm
sure
we
wouldn't
be
here
arguing
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
do
so
to
a
certain
extent.
certainly
to
the
extent
seems
to
me
of
taking
into
account
all
factors
that
bare
upon
the
likely
success
of
his
suit
because
if
he
were
to
file
a
suit
that
he
thought
had
no
hope
of
prevailing,
it
would
surely
impose
upon
the
rights
of
the
non
complaining
members.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
we
all
say
he
can
be
arbitrary,
we
just
say
that
his
exercise
of
discretion
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
but
that's
not
the
same
thing
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
precisely.
there
are
other
sanctions,
congress
made
a
very
deliberate
decision
to
trust.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
precisely.
one
of
the
differences
between
your
prosecutorial
discretion
type
of
case
and
this
case
is
that
with
the
typical
criminal
case,
your
complaining
witness
at
least
has
some
sort
of
a
private
remedy.
and
here
i
take
it
congress
has
preempted
all
private
remedies
so
that
if
the
secretary
refuses
to
file,
the
complaining
party
has
no
remedy?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
that's
true
in
the
sense
but
it's
also
true
to
general
counsel
of
the
labor
board.
if
they
--
an
employee
files
a
charge
that
he
was
dismissed
because
of
union
activities
and
the
general
counsel
after
investigating
it
decides
not
to
file
a
complaint
for
one
reason
or
another,
arbitrary
or
not,
there's
--
it's
established
that
there
is
no
further
right.
he's
--
that's
his
only
right,
his
only
remedy
is
to
have
the
protection
of
the
general
counsel
and
thereafter
the
board.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
my
understanding
is
that
if
with
that
kind
of
a
charge,
you
would
have
no
other
right.
there
maybe
other
kinds
of
charges
that
would
be
filed
against
an
employer
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
go
to
court.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
if
the
language
really
is
differently
structured
mr.
justice
stewart,
the
--
what
it
says
is
in
more
--
it's
a
little
bit
clearer
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
it
says
that
the
general
--
believe
the
general
counsel's
decision
whether
to
file
a
complaint
will
be
final
or
has
a
final
authority
on
behalf
of
the
board
to
determine
whether
complaints
should
be
filed.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
i',
relying
on
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
exactly
and
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
and
the
whole.
the
whole
structure
of
this
acts
enforcement
scheme
makes
it
plain
how
the
--
what
the
result
is
should
be
the
same
as
with
the
general
counsel
of
the
labor
board.
we
have
ceded
five
minutes
of
our
time
to
mr.
gottesman
who's
here
on
behalf
of
the
steelworkers,
i'd
like
to
remain
the
balance
of
my
time.
