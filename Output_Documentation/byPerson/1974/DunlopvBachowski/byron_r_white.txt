does
the
secretary's
decision
not
to
sue
must
be
preceded
i
gather
by
his
determining
that
there
is
not
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
is,
isn't
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
did
you
find
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
it
weren't
in
there
--
let's
just
assume
it
weren't
in
there
and
the
statute
simply
says
on
its
face,
if
there's
probable
cause,
the
secretary
shall,
shall
bring
a
civil
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
hardly
--
that's
hardly
unlimited,
discretion
in
the
secretary,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
being
as
un
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it,
there's
a
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
the
way
you
put
it
in
your
brief.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
your
legislative
history?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
--
you
say
that
the
secretary
should
have
the
unreviewable
discretion
of
a
prosecutor
deciding
not
to
file
a
charge.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
the
secretary
could
be
as
arbitrary
as
he
wants
to
in
turning
down
a
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it's
unreviewable?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
arbitrary
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
it's
arbitrary
or
not,
you
say
it's
not
judicially
reviewable?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
secretary
ought
to
leave
behind
him
some
evidence
that
he
has
done
the
job,
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there's
--
there
might
be
judicial
review
to
the
extent
of
requiring
the
secretary
to
a.
process
a
complaint
and
b.
to
do
it
in
accordance
with
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
required
to
make
a
decision
on
the
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
whether
the
file
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
must
he
also
as
i
say
leave
some
tracks
that
indicate
that
he
has
decided,
there
is
not
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
--
how
about
that,
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
he
can
be
required
to
state
reasons
as
to
why
he
doesn't
think
there's
probable
cause
or
does
he
just
have
to
say
that
there
isn't
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
either
of
the
certiorari?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
say
it's
admitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
why
do
you
say
the
government
admitted
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
this
case
is
all
different
than
if
the
secretary
had
said,
i
know
you
file
a
complaint
but
i'm
just
not
going
to
process
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
would
say
that
the
secretary
should
have
--
he
should
have
answered
and
said
i
investigated
and
i
performed
my
duty
and
i
move
to
dismiss?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
if
he
to
said
that,
wouldn't
it
--
wouldn't
the
court
had
been
through
then?
he
wouldn't
had
to
have
a
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
rauh,
as
i
understand,
you
seem
to
have
made
two
points.
one,
that
the
secretary
didn't
even
do
his
job
here
or
even
purport
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
secondly,
that
even
if
he
did
it,
he
was
arbitrary,
arbitrary
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
first
issue
seems
to
have
voiced
down
in
this
case,
its
because
the
government
doesn't
contest
and
neither
does
the
opposing
union
contest,
the
secretary
has
to
make
the
decision,
it
has
to
get
reasons
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
in
which
event,
he
is
going
to
demonstrate
that
he
is
at
least
covered
to
track
the
act
indicate
he
should
cover?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
i
know
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
that
isn't
my
point
now.
i
just
want
to
know
now,
is
the
first
issue
washed
out?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
hasn't
it,
because
now
they're
going
to
have
to
give
reasons,
they're
going
to
have
to
prove
that
they
didn't
disregard
the
complaint,
that
they
made
the
investigation,
there
isn't
probable
cause
and
here's
why.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
that
was
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
before
this
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
which
event
you
will
--
if
that
is
what
occurred,
then
you're
going
to
know
that
they
have
at
least
purported
to
do
their
job.
would
you
claim
your
paragraph
and
the
complaint
alleges
and
that
is
then
they
didn't?
