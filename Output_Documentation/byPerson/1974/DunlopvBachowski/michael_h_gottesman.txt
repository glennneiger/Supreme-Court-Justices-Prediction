mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
congress
when
it
enacted
the
landrum-griffin
act,
it
spent
more
time
on
shaping
the
enforcement
remedy
of
title
iv
than
almost
any
other
of
its
provisions.
and
it
spent
so
much
time
because
it
really
had
two
essentially
conflicting
objectives
that
it
was
trying
to
accomplish.
and
it
was
trying
to
calibrate
precisely
the
right
balance
between
them
so
that
it
had
an
effective
enforcement
mechanism
but
one
that
was
not
going
to
injure
its
other
concern
and
that
other
concern
was
that
unions
be
able
to
function
effectively
and
that
they
have
stability
of
leadership
and
that
their
leadership
not
always
be
under
a
cloud.
now,
how
did
congress
shaped
that
balance?
we
know
of
course
that
their
one
concern,
the
major
concern
was
to
have
democratic
union
elections.
and
to
that
end,
they
enacted
not
only
a
very
comprehensive
substantive
code
but
they
put
the
full
weight
of
the
federal
government
into
the
enforcement
of
that
code.
they
said
the
labor
department
shall
investigate
at
the
behest
of
any
member
and
if
the
secretary
of
labor
found
probable
cause
that
a
violation
may
have
occurred
that
he
bring
a
lawsuit.
now,
i
might
say
that
there
is
no
other
election
in
this
county,
public
or
private
that's
regulated
as
extensively,
either
substantively
or
in
terms
of
the
enforcement
machinery
as
union
elections
are
under
title
iv
and
that
so
whether
or
not
you
add
to
that
arsenal
the
additional
item
of
judicial
review
that
is
sought
in
this
case.
now,
though
congress
provided
that
arsenal
of
enforcement,
substantive
and
enforcement
machinery,
it
was
also
very
concerned
about
the
implications
of
that.
and
the
implication
it
was
most
concerned
about
was
that
if
in
every
union
election,
there
could
then
be
a
subsequent
legal
challenge
which
could
go
on
indefinitely.
the
title
to
union
office
would
be
under
a
continuing
cloud
and
the
capacity
of
unions
to
function
would
be
adversely
affected.
congressman
after
all
or
politician,
they
know
that
in
an
election
year,
there
is
some
legislation
that
doesn't
get
passed
or
considered.
there
are
some
steps
that
aren't
taken.
and
they
were
concerned
that
if
union
elections
could
be
under
a
constant
challenge,
union
officers
would
be
like
elected
officials
in
the
election
year
all
the
time.
they
would
always
be
pulling
their
shots
for
fear,
number
one
that
there's
an
election
right
around
the
corner
and
not
only
would
they
be
pulling
their
shots
but
the
employees
who
look
to
them
for
direction
and
the
employers
who
have
to
deal
with
them
at
the
bargaining
table
would
not
be
certain,
number
one,
whether
these
people
were
ever
properly
elected
in
the
first
place
and
number
two,
whether
they're
still
going
to
be
there
a
week
from
now,
and
it
would
affect
and
vitally
affect
the
whole
collective
bargaining
process
and
the
whole
internal
process
of
unions.
and
so,
though
congress
created
this
machinery
for
enforcing
union
democracy,
it
also
provided
very
carefully
for
when
the
curtain
would
be
run
down
on
that
machinery
and
when
it
could
be
said,
okay,
members
of
this
union,
your
officers
have
now
been
finally
determined,
the
status
is
no
longer
under
a
cloud,
employers
know
who
to
deal
with,
employees
know
who
to
look
to
and
you
shall
now
go
on
for
the
duration
of
the
term.
and
to
that
end,
congress
number
one,
could
very
reach
a
time
limit
into
the
complaint
mechanism
of
the
statute.
members
have
to
go
to
the
secretary
within
a
specified
time.
if
the
secretary
is
going
to
sue,
he
has
to
bring
that
lawsuit
within
a
specified
time.
congress
was
anxious
in
that
way,
it
said
time
was
of
the
essence
to
end
the
cloud
on
title
of
the
union
office.
beyond
that,
congress
expressly
took
away
the
right
of
individual
union
members
to
institute
these
lawsuits
because
that
would
have
left
to
any
union
member
the
capacity
to
put
the
union
title
under
cloud.
and
finally,
what
congress
did
was
to
say
that
this
action
which
the
secretary
of
labor
could
bring
if
he
found
that
there
were
violations
that
may
have
affected
the
outcome
was
exclusive
so
that
it
ay
clear
that
if
the
secretary
reach
the
contrary
determination,
there
would
not
indeed
be
a
continuing
cloud
over
the
union
office,
the
curtain
would
ring
down,
the
officer's
title
would
be
clearly
established.
now,
to
allow
the
suits
of
the
type
that's
involved
here
totally
undoes
that
statutory
structure.
it
totally
undoes
it
because
it
puts
back
in
the
hands
of
every
union
candidate
in
every
union
election
the
capacity
to
indefinitely
leave
title
to
union
office
under
a
cloud.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely,
i
think
this
court
could
well
inquire
as
to
what
procedures
should
lead
up
to
the
secretary's
decision.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
as
to
a.
the
failure
to
investigate
clearly,
he
could
be
mandamus
to
investigate
as
the
statute
requires.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
absolutely.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
court
below
said
that
he
had
to
and
it
said
that
it
would
have
reached
that
result
independent
of
the
reviewability
of
his
decision.
they
said
“we
want
people
to
state
the
reasons
for
administrative
action.”
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
not
at
all,
nor
does
the
secretary.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
court
below
said,
he's
got
to
tell
the
complaining
member
of
the
reasons
and
the
secretary
expressly
has
said
that
he
is
not
seeking
review
of
that
determination.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no,
not
at
all.
now,
if
all
we
were
concerned
about
was
the
fact
that
theoretically
one
member
in
that
rare
case
in
a
million
where
the
secretary
is
arbitrary
could
institute
a
lawsuit,
the
concern
about
clouding
union
title
wouldn't
be
very
great.
but
i
think
we
have
to
realistically
recognize
that
there
are
incentives
to
bring
these
lawsuits
other
than
the
prospects
which
are
always
going
to
be
small
that
they
can
be
successful.
the
losing
candidate
in
the
union
election
if
he
hopes
to
run
again
needs
a
forum
to
keep
his
name
in
attention,
to
keep
his
charges
against
his
opponent
alive
and
these
lawsuits
are
magnificent
vehicles
for
that
purpose.
there's
nothing
the
media
of
more
than
internal
union
conflict.
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit
is
attracted
enormous
media
attention.
the
charges
that
are
made
in
the
complaint
in
this
lawsuit
have
been
repeatedly
recited
in
the
press
in
the
pittsburg
area.
and
of
course,
there's
also
the
opportunity
for
discovery
which
is
useful
to
a
candidate
who'd
like
to
find
that
with
which
to
campaign
next
time
around.
so
that
these
lawsuits
will
be
seen
as
attractive
vehicles
by
candidates
irrespective
of
whether
they
think
there's
any
realistic
chance
of
setting
the
secretary's
decision
aside
as
arbitrary
and
capricious.
and
thus,
you
can
anticipate
that
in
order
to
accommodate
that
one
case
in
a
million
where
the
secretary
is
arbitrary,
you're
going
to
totally
topple
the
congressional
concern
that
union
officer's
titles
not
be
under
an
indefinite
cloud
at
the
behest
of
any
union
member.
now
in
closing,
i'd
like
to
note
that
we
think
the
--
though
the
statutory
interpretation
question
is
clear,
there
would
be
a
very
serious
constitutional
question
if
this
court
were
to
read
the
statute
differently
than
we
do.
never
at
least
as
far
as
any
of
these
parties
have
been
able
to
find,
as
the
federal
courts
ever
directed
the
executive
branch
to
bring
a
lawsuit
before
them.
there's
a
serious
separation
of
powers
question
of
whether
the
court
assumes
a
prosecutorial,
mental
when
it
not
only
directs
the
secretary
to
file
a
lawsuit
but
of
necessity
tells
him
what
allegations
to
include
in
the
complaint
in
that
lawsuit.
and
the
court
would
have
to
do
that
because
after
all
not
every
one
of
the
dozens
of
charges
that
the
complainant
may
bring
to
the
court
was
necessarily
so
powerful
that
the
secretary
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
not
suing
about
it.
the
courts
is
going
to
have
to
shift
through
those
and
say
mr.
secretary,
i
think
you
oath
to
sue
on
items
1,
5,
9
and
12,
you
are
arbitrary
and
capricious
on
those.
so
the
courts
in
the
process
of
telling
the
executive
branch,
file
a
complaint
before
me,
here
are
the
allegations
i
want
you
to
make
and
it's
ironic
that
under
a
statute
in
which
congress
evidence
no
intent
for
such
review
that
we
would
have
to
get
to
such
a
constitutional
question.
thank
you.
