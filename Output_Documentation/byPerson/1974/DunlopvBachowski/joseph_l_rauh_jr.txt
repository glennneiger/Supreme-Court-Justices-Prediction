mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
rendered
simple
by
two
points.
first,
the
provision
of
the
verified
complaint
admitted
before
this
court
that
the
secretary's
own
investigation
substantiated
our
allegations
of
violation
and
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
we
pleaded
more
than
we
have
to
mr.
justice
white,
you
made
the
point
that
says
only
that
the
violations,
we
pleaded
the
violations,
the
secretary
found
them
and
that
they
may
have
--
and
more
--
this
--
the
most
statute
could
require
is
that
they
may
have
affected
the
outcome,
we
pleaded
that
they
did
affect
the
outcome,
that's
admitted
before
this
court.
second,
that's
paragraph
18
of
our
complaint.
second,
the
statute
provides
that
under
the
admitted
circumstances
of
this
case
on
the
complaint
namely
that
the
secretary's
own
investigation
found
violations
which
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election,
the
secretary
shall
sue
to
upset
the
election..
not
may
sue
but
shall
sue.
if
you
look
at
the
government's
brief
on
page
3
where
they
set
forth,
the
statute
--
secretary
--
the
statutes
reads,
the
secretary
shall
investigate
such
a
complaint
and
if
he
finds
probable
cause.
and
the
most
that
probable
cause
could
mean
is
that
there
are
violations
and
they
may
have
affected
the
outcome,
we
pleaded
more.
if
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
there
has
been
a
violation,
he
shall
bring
a
civil
action.
now,
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
of
paragraph
18
of
our
complaint
sir.
it's
on
page
5
(a)
of
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
because
it
was
dismissed
on
jurisdictional
grounds.
you
see,
this
--
there
was
never
an
answer
filed.
the
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
--
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
on
jurisdictional
grounds
and
therefore
obviously
everything
we
have
pleaded
not
only
must
be
accepted
but
must
be
--
not
only
accepted
but
has
to
be
given
a
favorable
construction.
the
court
said
--
in
essence
what
the
court
said,
nothing
you
can
plead
will
change
my
mind.
i
got
nothing
to
do
with
this.
and
so
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
18
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir.
now,
this
is
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
in
the
nature,
yes
sir
but
it
--
you
could
either
--
we
didn't
call
it
that
but
i
think
you
could
say
it
was
in
the
nature
of
mandamus
action
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
it's
a
mandamus
action
only
in
the
sense
it
would
require
the
secretary
to
do
something.
it's
not
a
mandamus
action
and
it's
a
review
action
of
the
secretary
set
of
conduct.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
i
--
i
may
have
misspoken
but
it
was
mandamus
in
the
sense
that
we
require
him
to
do
something
but
it
wasn't
the
normal
review,
the
normal
judicial
review
and
administrative
agency
is
to
require
them
to
do
something,
to
do
something
different
than
they
wanted.
in
that
sense,
it's
a
perfectly
normal
review.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
exactly
what
he
did.
his
own
investigation
showed
this.
now,
you
may
ask
me
how
do
i
know
this.
we
have
a
verified
complaint
to
this.
we
have
it
from
the
pittsburg
office
of
the
secretary
of
labor.
that's
where
we
got
it.
we
don't
--
mr.
kenneth
ublansky
is
a
member
of
this
court
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
could
have
done
that
but
he
didn't.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
we
will
--
i
think
we
would
have
had
a
right
to
review.
now,
i
like
to
--
this
is
exactly
the
point
sir.
this
is
not
a
case
of
arbitrary
abuse
of
discretion.
this
is
far
worse
than
abuse
of
discretion.
the
secretary
had
no
discretion
to
abuse.
this
is
a
simple
case
where
the
secretary
refused
to
act
on
his
own
investigation
as
required
by
the
statute.
but
the
statute
in
this
case
just
fits
it
but
i
don't
--
and
that
point
has
never
been
referred
to
by
the
government.
the
government
never
said
anything.
you
didn't
hear
a
word
said
about
paragraph
18
and
the
allegation
there
but
let
me
say
this,
i
like
to
look
at
it
in
a
broader
context.
i
think
the
case
is
over
when
we
alleged
probable
cause,
it's
dismissed
on
jurisdictional
grounds
and
then
we
come
here.
i
think
we've
won
the
case
but
i'm
going
to
argue
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
but
no,
i
want
to
argue
a
broader
point.
i
think
there
is
a
reviewability
of
abuse
of
discretion.
even
if
you
didn't
accept,
i
want
to
go
farther.
i
want
to
look
at
this
at
the
broader
point.
i
disagree
completely
with
the
government
on
the
question
of
abuse
of
discretion.
the
government
says
there
is
no
right
of
review
of
abuse
of
discretion.
i'd
like
to
argue
that
as
the
major
point
even
though
the
minor
premises,
i
don't
know
that
should
get
to
that.
now,
on
the
major
premise,
what's
apa
all
about
if
this
isn't
an
apa
case?
there's
a
presumption
of
reviewability
under
apa.
it
takes
clear
and
convincing
evidence
to
rebut
that
presumption
and
actually
we
don't
even
need
that
presumption
because
there
are
more
congressional
indicators
of
intent
to
review
than
there
are
the
other
way.
there's
the
mandatory
term
of
the
statute,
i
won't
repeat
that.
there's
the
desire
of
congress
to
preserve
preexisting
rights
to
which
justice
rehnquist
addressed
himself.
this
interpretation
of
the
government
does
away
with
all
our
preexisting
rights.
it
means,
we
the
minority
in
the
unions
who
had
a
right
to
sue
under
the
constitution
under
old
state
law,
to
sue
under
the
union
constitution,
now
lose
that
right
and
they
say
the
secretary
can
arbitrarily
take
that
away,
that
couldn't
have
been
the
congressional
intent.
indeed
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no,
no.
i
precisely
because
they
took
it
away.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
rely,
thank
you
sir.
i
rely
on
it
because
they
couldn't
have
both
taken
it
away
and
then
said
the
secretary
who
now
is
your
union
lawyer
--
your
lawyer
for
you
to
vindicate
those
rights
can
do
it
arbitrarily.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
would
but
i
don't
have
to.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
said
i
don't
have
to,
say
there's
a
constitutional
problem,
there
might
be
a
contracts
clause.
a
member
has
a
contract
in
his
union
sir
and
it
may
deprive
him
of
those
rights
but
i
can't
under
due
process
but
i
don't
need
that.
there's
no
intent,
there's
no
showing
they
intended
to
do
that.
in
fact,
the
showing
is
that
they
wanted
it
the
other
way
in
403,
they
squarely
say,
we
protect
the
preexisting
rights
prior
to
the
statute
--
prior
to
the
election,
we
don't
protect
them
after
the
election,
the
secretary
is
to
protect
them.
i
can't
believe
they
intended
to
give
the
secretary
that
right
to
protect
them
and
then
say
he
could
be
as
arbitrary
as
you
wanted
in
protecting
it.
indeed,
they
call
him
the
union
member's
lawyer.
well,
don't
tell
me
i
got
a
lawyer
who
is
able
to
be
arbitrary
in
handling
my
case.
that's
what
they're
in
effect
saying.
secretary's
done
that.
you're
going
to
the
basic
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
statute
was
for
union
democracy.
is
it
to
be
interpreted?
do
they
want
it
to
give
the
secretary
the
arbitrary
right?
i
didn't
hear
anybody
challenge
the
statement
that
we
made
on
the
bottom
of
page
6
in
our
brief.
counsel
for
the
secretary
in
the
court
below
when
--
this
is
footnote
4.
counsel
for
the
secretary
in
the
court
below
when
asked
whether
the
government's
claim
of
immunity
from
review
included
a
case
where
union
made
a
substantial
political
contribution
in
return
for
the
secretary's
decision
not
to
sue,
answered
in
the
affirmative.
cited,
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
in
this
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
a
function
that
involved
some
discretion.
not
in
this
case
as
i
pointed
out
earlier.
but
in
the
ordinary
case,
there
would
be
some
discretion.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
had
a
double
function
your
honor,
there
was
something
in
a
nature
of
an
umpire
but
senator
kennedy
said
on
the
floor
and
as
this
court
referred
to
in
trbovich,
he
also
was
to
act
as
a
union
member's
lawyer
because
the
union
couldn't
sue
--
the
union
couldn't
sue
himself.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
i
think
he
was
the
union
member's
lawyer,
i
don't
think
it
was
in
that
connection
sir.
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
are
the
lawyer,
you
are
the
lawyer.
i
don't
think
it
was
a
--
it
was
limited
as
to
time
service.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
prosecutorial
function
too.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
he
has
the
double
function
according
to
the
senator
kennedy
saying
we
are
taking
away
the
right
of
the
union
member
to
sue,
we're
treating
the
secretary's
union
member's
lawyer.
he
has
a
double
function
there
sir.
there's
no
way
of
getting
away
from
the
double
function.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
whatever
that
might
mean
sir
but
in
a
case
where
you
have
the
violations
affecting
the
outcome,
i
can
see
no
other
judge
malefactor
that
would
come
in
to
it.
but
furthermore,
he
didn't
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir
but
he
has
to
find
it
and
something
i
think
that
a
court
could
reasonably
feel
was
the
public
interest.
it
would
be
that
point
which
i
would
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
if
it
didn't
give
him
final
power,
if
it
did,
it
sure
an
exception
because
after
apa,
the
number
of
cases
this
court
has
said
are
totally
unreviewable
or
might
be
limited.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes,
precisely
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
on
the
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
sir,
for
16
years,
the
labor
department
has
not
given
reasons.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
wait
a
minute,
when
we
were
here
in
this
supreme
court,
you
always
get
improvement
in
the
government
when
you're
in
the
supreme
court.
when
we
were
in
the
supreme
court
for
the
first
time
in
16
years
of
the
statute,
they
finally
admitted
they
had
to
give
reasons.
now,
why
in
heaven's
name
should
they
have
to
give
reasons
and
not
have
to
justify
the
reasons?
suppose
they
said
i
didn't
want
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
no
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
show
that
they
made
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
--
they
gave
us
oral
phone
call
we
are
not
going
to
sue.
that's
what
we
learned
about
this.
now,
a
year
later
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
before
we
got
to
the
supreme
court
and
all
of
a
sudden,
the
labor
department
when
they're
in
the
supreme
court
suddenly
says,
oh,
we're
happy
to
give
you
reasons
and
they
start
giving
them.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's
final
until
we
go
back
and
look,
we
can
go
back
to
the
district
court
if
this
is
reviewable
and
they
can
then
say
what
they
want
to
say
about
it,
which
they
didn't
say
before.
they
can
say
it
in
the
district
court
when
we
go
back
under
the
third
circuit.
now,
look
at
their
indicators,
the
government's
indicators
on
how
weak
they
are.
they
say,
we're
trying
to
circumvent
the
mechanism
of
the
act.
we're
not
trying
to
circumvent
anything.
we
have
to
prove
arbitrary
and
capriciousness.
that
isn't
the
same
as
trying
to
sue.
the
exclusive
remedy
far
from
helping
them
hurts
them.
congress,
when
they
gave
an
exclusive
remedy,
must
have
felt
they
weren't
going
to
be
arbitrarily
applied.
you
don't
give
exclusive
remedies
for
arbitrary
application
and
i
think
trbovich
settles
this.
everything
said
this
morning
by
the
representatives
or
the
government
and
the
union
was
said
by
solicitor
general
griswold
to
this
court
in
71
when
i
argued
the
trbovich
case
against
him.
he
said
the
exclusive
remedy
shows
you
can't
intervene.
well,
the
exclusive
remedy
no
more
shows
you
couldn't
intervene
as
this
court
held
than
it
shows
that
you
can't
do
anything
about
it.
this
court
rejected
the
proposition
that
the
private
poor
minority
in
the
union
was
helpless.
this
court
rejected
that
and
it
must
reject
it
again.
indeed,
it's
funny
if
you
look
at
the
government's
brief,
you
might
have
your
luck
look
back
because
it's
funny.
what
the
government's
brief
and
its
legislative
history
did
was
just
a
pluck
at
right
out
of
trbovich
and
yet
this
court
had
said
in
trbovich,
this
is
what
the
court
said
in
trbovich
about
the
government,
the
secretary.
in
his
view,
the
legislative
history
shows
the
congress
deliberately
chose
to
exclude
union
members
entirely
from
any
direct
participation
in
judicial
enforcement
proceedings
under
title
iv
and
then
you
rejected
this
unanimously.
and
the
exact
same
legislative
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
out
of
the
trbovich
government
brief,
they
plucked
the
legislative
history
section
of
this
brief
which
your
honors
had
already
rejected
in
trbovich
as
not
showing
you
wanted
to
exclude
the
minority
member
from
any
union
part
--
any
participation
in
the
process.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
almost
identical.
it
was
--
i
got
a
good
laugh
because
somebody
just
copied
it
out.
and
it
was
exactly
what
you
rejected
on
the
very
point
that's
before
this
court.[laughter]
touche
sir.
well,
yeah,
they
made
a
lot
of
the
time
that
cloud
over
title.
honestly,
the
only
word
that
can
describe
that
coming
from
the
secretary
of
labor
is
foot
spa.
the
secretary
has
stalled
and
stalled
these
cases.
as
the
yale
law
journal
says
in
a
careful
180
page
study
of
their
performance
over
15
years,
they
violate
the
60-day
provision
time
and
again,
take
much
more
than
60
days
to
sue
and
they
take
two
and
a
half
years
on
the
average,
one
from
complaint
to
judgment.
for
them
now
to
come
and
say
that
we
shouldn't
be
able
to
sue
because
of
the
time
schedule
is
shocking.
on
prosecutorial
discretion
mr.
justice
rehnquist
said
it,
i
think
just
right
that
there's
a
civil
remedy
still
available
in
the
criminal
field
and
that
is
the
difference
and
of
course
there
is
none
here.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
was
going
to
just
get
to
the
nlrb
sir.
it's
difference
for
many
reasons.
i
guess
the
simplest
one
would
be
from
the
statute.
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
are
referred
to
the
statute.
i
had
--
the
languages
in
the
footnote
6
on
page
15
of
the
brief
amicus
curiae
for
the
association
for
union
democracy,
it's
the
blue
brief
on
page
15,
they
have
the
language,
it
says
that
he
shall
have
power
to
issue
a
complaint
that
nowhere
says
that
he
shall
do
so.
but
more
important,
that's
just
that
the
language
is
different
but
much
more
important
than
that
is
it
was
difference
in
that.
it
set
up
new
rights.
it
didn't
take
away
any
rights
and
that
is
the
fundamental
difference
between
the
two
to
say
nothing
of
all
the
procedures
that
they
have
at
the
labor
board
and
they
have
none
here
whatever.
but
the
real
point
is
that
they
--
that
the
labor
board
is
predicated
on
new
rights
given
under
the
original
wagner
act
which
didn't
exist
before.
here,
a
great
part
of
what
is
given
was
predicated
on
all
rights
which
will
be
gone
forever
if
they
could
be
arbitrarily
destroyed
by
the
secretary's
action.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
i
don't,
but
they
may
have
preempted
some
but
by
in
large
sir,
there
was
nothing
in
the
labor
law
compared
to
what
the
government
admits
is
--
was
here.
the
government
admits
on
page
12
of
their
brief
exactly
all
of
the
pre
existing
rights
that
we
did
have.
there
was
nothing
compared
to
that.
the
situation
is
totally
different
with
the
wagner.
of
course,
there's
a
lot
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
rule.
it
leaves
that
general
counsel,
they
report
unreviewable
but
i
don't
need
to
go
into
that
because
it
is
totally
different
in
this
section.
when
you
weigh
the
two
sets
of
indicators,
the
language,
the
preexisting
rights
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
i
most
respectfully
suggest
to
this
court
that
there
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
none,
that
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
of
reviewability
and
not
of
none
reviewability,
i
don't
need
to
go
that
far.
they
have
--
they've
got
the
burden
that
we
--
they've
got
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
how
anybody,
i
cannot
believe
that
anybody
could
suggest
that
there
was
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
congress
intended
non-reviewability.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
oh
i'd
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
it's
mandamus
in
remedy,
it's
a
review
of
administrative
action
under
the
apa.
i
don't
think
anybody's
ever
challenged
that
it's
reviewable
under
the
apa
if
it
isn't.
the
government
doesn't
challenge
this?
if
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
government
does
not
challenge
that
if
the
exception
to
apa
does
not
apply
namely
that
this
is
left
entirely
to
the
agency
that
the
apa
doesn't
apply.
they're
not
suggesting
the
apa
doesn't
apply,
they
say
the
apa
does
apply
but
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
the
deception
so
they
don't
even
make
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
one
of
the
apa's
exceptions.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
they
can
file
an
answer.
they
haven't
filed
one
yet.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
say
there
was
no
probable
cause.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
we
can
show
as
we
will
show
that
that
defense
is
totally
false.
i'll
use
that
word.
that
that
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
have
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
they
--
if
they
show
that
there
was
no
probable
cause.
we
lose
on
the
ground
it
wasn't
under
the
statute
or
wasn't
arbitrary.
we
can
lose
on
the
facts,
the
questions
whether
we
have
a
right
to
show
that
they
violated
the
statutory
provision
or
that
they
abused
their
discretion.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
they
can
show
that
they
weren't
arbitrary
or
that
it
didn't
apply
and
that
isn't
a
very
high
thing.
we
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
they're
wrongs
is
going
to
be
pretty
difficult.
i
think
we
can
do
it
because
of
what
we
were
informed
that
the
pittsburg
office
says
exactly
what
paragraph
18
says
and
that
this
was
sworn
to
by
our
plaintiff
and
notarized
by
mr.
ublansky.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
only
to
the
extent
that
it
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
or
in
our
terms,
that
they
are
not
saying
what
the
facts
are.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
and
that's
what
the
third
circuit
said
we
had
and
what
they
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well
for
ones
your
honor
the
government
doesn't
even
claim
there
is
a
real
burden
here.
there's
so
few
cases.
there's
so
few
times
of
poor
minority
member
of
a
union
can
go
this
far.
they
can's
lawyers,
they
can't
get
every
--
the
number
of
cases
you
can
put
in
my
eye.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
in
conclusion
--
did
i
cut
you
off,
i
didn't
--
i
mean
to,
i
--
[laughter]
after
that
beautiful
statement,
i
didn't
mean
to
be
rude
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yes
sir.
if
you
look
on
page
1
of
the
record
sir,
under
november
12,
ordered
entered
on
proposal
file
11973
granting
defendants
oral
motion
made
that
hearing
in
chambers
to
dismiss.
to
see
it
was
right,
it's
right.
that's
the
only
reference
to
it
but
--
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
that's
right,
there
on
the
relevant
doctrine.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
now
he
made
--
immediate
oral
motion
to
dismiss
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
so
it's
just
sir,
i
just
--
i
cannot
believe
that
docket
entry
is
wrong.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
well,
it's
right
there
sir.
mr.
joseph
l.
rauh,
jr.
yeah,
and
a
motion
to
dismiss
against
the
tro.
they
could
have
just
opposed
the
tro.
they
moved
to
dismiss
as
an
opposition
to
it.
in
conclusion,
i
want
to
make
the
confession
that
i
think
the
two
amicus
briefs
are
better
than
mine.
and
it
is
--
i
don't
say
that
better
larceny,
but
they
are
but
they're
better
briefs.
and
better
briefs
because
they
deal
with
the
real
world.
i
couldn't
do
that.
i
can't
get
up
here
and
tell
all
the
facts
about
this
fight.
i've
been
in
it.
but
these
two
amicus
briefs
i
respectfully
suggest
are
the
heart
of
what
this
is
all
about.
in
the
association
for
union
democracy
brief,
they
make
clear
that
the
whole
purpose
of
this
statute
comports
with
reviewability.
it's
a
beautiful
piece
that
was
written
by
the
distinguished
yale
professor
of
law,
clyde
summers
and
by
my
former
associates,
mr.
feldene.
the
other
brief
by
the
umwa
is
an
allotment
effort
to
explain
what
the
fight
for
union
democracy
is
been
all
about
and
on
page
3,
it
says
the
struggle
by
umwa
members
to
overturn
tyranny
in
their
union
was
a
lonely
and
difficult
one
impart
because
of
apathy
and
indifference.
if
not
outright
prejudice
against
him
by
the
officials
within
the
united
states
department
of
labor
purportedly
the
guardians
of
union
member's
rights
and
their
lmrta
to
often
union
reformers
have
found
the
department
of
labor
allied
with
union
incumbents
against
their
court's
decision
in
trbovich
made
possible
the
cleanup
of
the
united
mineworkers
union
and
i
say
this
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart,
footnote
8
of
the
trbovich
decision
determine
the
outcome
of
the
mineworkers
fight
because
what
it
said
was
we
could
go
into
the
remedies
and
as
we
fought
for
remedies
for
the
new
election,
the
labor
department
oppose
us
on
a
return.
these
two
brought
brief
show
what
a
reformer
is
up
against
in
the
union
movement.
congress
intended
to
further
democracy
in
unions
and
only
by
review
of
the
secretary's
action,
can
we
do
this.
something
beautiful
happened
under
lmrda
and
the
mineworkers
and
it's
spreading
to
other
unions.
it's
spreading
just
as
congress
intended
that
there
be
more
democracy
and
i
plead
with
this
court
not
to
deal
this
movement
for
union
democracy,
the
body
blow
of
permitting
arbitrary
action
by
the
secretary.
don't
ever
forget
the
precious
on
the
secretary
of
labor
from
the
incumbents
in
a
case
drawing
out
of
the
same
set
of
elections
in
the
steelworkers.
the
president
in
the
steelworkers
in
a
deposition
said,
our
official
family
backs
the
incumbent
that
every
turn
with
every
thing
we
have,
the
pressure
is
tremendous.
if
we
don't
have
a
right
to
sue,
if
the
loser
with
all
he
loses
when
he
does
sue
comes
forward
and
he
can't
bring
a
suit,
then
the
fight
maybe
hopeless.
and
as
i
pleaded
four
years
ago
for
intervention
in
trbovich
which
made
the
difference
there,
i
plead
for
this
right
to
on
behalf
of
a
great
number
of
people
who
believe
in
union
democracy.
