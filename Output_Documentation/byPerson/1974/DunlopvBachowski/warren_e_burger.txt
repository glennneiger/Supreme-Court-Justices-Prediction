very
well
mr.

mr.

chief

mr.
rauh.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
your
suit
in
the
district
court
something
in
the
nature
of
a
mandamus
action?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
mandamus
action
not
limited
to
an
inquiry
and
to
whether
the
procedure
followed
was
proper?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mandamus
does
not
lie
to
compelling
discretionary
act,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn't
the
secretary
something
a
little
different
or
a
little
more
than
attorney
for
the
union.
doesn't
he
occupy
a
role
or
something
like
the
one
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
when
it's
described
as
a
quasi
judicial
function?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
magisterial
function,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
the
first
instance
when
the
problem
is
presented
to
him,
he
is
to
act
as
something
in
the
nature
of
an
umpire,
he
is
neither
on
the
side
of
the
union
or
on
the
side
of
the
decedents,
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
once
he
has
decided
that
an
action
should
be
brought?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we're
talking
about
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
but
we
also
have
often
said
--
many
courts
have
said,
he
has
a
magisterial
function
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
magisterial
too.
he
must
first
make
the
decision
whether
he
is
going
to
bring
the
suit
and
then
once
he
has
made
that
decision
then
he
is
an
advocate
and
adversary.
but
until
the
secretary
of
labor
has
made
the
decision
here,
do
you
suggest
he
is
adversary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
two
minutes
left
mr.
solicitor
general
if
you
have
anything
further.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
