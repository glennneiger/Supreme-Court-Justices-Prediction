74-466,
dunlop
v.
bachowski
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
of
1959,
requires
that
any
complaint,
the
violations
of
that
act
occurred
in
the
conduct
of
a
union
election
must
be
filed
with
the
secretary
of
labor.
the
act
provides
further
that
the
secretary
must
investigate
the
complaint
and
if
he
decides
that
violations
affecting
the
result
of
the
election
had
occurred
must
bring
a
civil
action
to
set
aside
the
election.
in
this
case,
a
complaint
was
filed
with
the
secretary
that
irregularities
had
occurred
in
an
election
conducted
by
the
united
steelworkers
of
america.
the
secretaries
investigation
led
him
to
conclude
that
although
there
were
irregularities
they
have
not
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election
and
he
therefore
refused
to
bring
a
suit
to
set
aside
the
election.
the
loser
in
the
election
then
brought
this
suit,
seeking
a
court
order
compelling
the
secretary
to
bring
the
suit.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
held
that
the
secretary's
decision
was
subject
to
judicial
review
and
that
such
review
extended
to
a
trial
type
inquiry
into
the
factual
basis
of
the
secretary's
conclusion
that
no
violations
occurred
that
affected
the
outcome
of
the
election.
we
disagree
and
reverse.
we
agree
that
the
decision
not
to
file
suit
is
not
immune
from
judicial
review.
we
hold,
however,
that
that
review
was
limited
to
the
determination
whether
a
statement
of
reasons
informing
the
court
and
the
complaining
union
member
of
the
grounds
of
the
secretary's
decision
and
the
essential
facts
upon
which
it
is
based
shows
within
the
four
corners
of
the
statement
itself
that
the
secretary's
decision
was
rationally
based
or
shows
rather
that
the
decision
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
