what?
unknown

this
falls
on
one
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
rauh,
are
you
suggest
that
if
you
prevail
in
this
proceeding
in
the
district
court,
the
government
can
do
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
for
example
--
unknown
speaker
suppose
i
did,
suppose
they
suggested,
you're
quite
wrong
in
your
allegations
in
paragraph
18
that
indeed
there
wasn't
investigation
and
there
wasn't
conclusion
by
the
secretary
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
concede,
then
what
can
you
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
positing
that
they
do
show
it,
no
matter
what
you
say.
unknown
speaker
no
matter
what
there
showing
maybe,
you
say
you
can
challenge
it
in
that
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
or
you
do
wind
up
in
any
case
where
the
secretary
spreads
on
the
record
as
they
conceded
he
must
that
he
had
made
an
investigation
and
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
following
reasons,
you
are
still
entitled
to
have
judicial
review
of
that
determination?
unknown
speaker
so
that
means
that
every
determination
of
the
secretary
under
this
statute
bottomed
as
the
government
now
concedes
it
must
be
bottom,
you
nevertheless
may
challenge.
unknown
speaker
that
this
courts
are
enough
be
represented
by
jo
rauh.
unknown
speaker
didn't
the
third
circuit
already
did
that?
unknown
speaker
they
did
--
they
said
we
do
have
to
in
this
case.
they
didn't
make
a
general
--
they
implied
that
we'd
have
to
do
it
continually,
but
i
mean
that
we
know,
we
didn't
bring
the
issue
because
the
facts
of
the
matter
is
the
secretary
always
does
at
least
the
last
five
years
i'm
told
provide
as
a
brief
statement
of
reasons
with
respect
to
every
case
that
he
closes.
and
if
a
complaining
member
is
unhappy
with
that
letter
that
he
receives,
he
is
always
entitled
to
ask
the
secretary
for
a
fuller
statement
and
they
always
accommodate
to
the
extent
they
can
whatever
request
they
get.
