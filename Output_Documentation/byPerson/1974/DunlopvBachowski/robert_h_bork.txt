mr.
robert
h.
bork
very
briefly
mr.
chief
justice,
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
paragraph
18
of
the
complaint
does
not
allege
that
the
secretary
found
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
violations
affected
the
outcome.
this
court
stated
in
glass
bottle
blowers
that
the
secretary
may
not
file
suit
unless
he
finds
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
violation
that
did
occur
infected
the
election.
second,
i
want
to
point
out
because
it
didn't
arise
at
all
during
mr.
rauh's
argument
that
the
secretary
in
compliance
with
the
mandate
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
subsequent
order
by
the
district
court
submitted
what
prints
out
to
15
pages
of
statement
of
reasons
in
this
case.
now,
while
we
don't
raise
the
issue
of
whether
the
secretary
must
submit
a
statement
of
reasons
in
this
case,
we
don't
necessarily
concede
that
he's
is
required
by
law
to
do
so.
we
didn't
bring
that
issue
here
because
as
a
practical
matter,
the
secretary
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
as
it
meant
--
what
--
the
reason
there
is
a
telephone
call
as
i
understand
it
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
there
was
this
letter
that
was
sent
the
same
--
two
days
later,
the
day
that
the
complaint
was
filed.
the
secretary
in
the
meantime
sent
a
letter.
a
very
briefed
and
summary
letter
because
the
time
was
short,
the
60th
day
was
coming
very
soon
and
the
case
was
enormously
complex
and
it
was
important
from
the
secretary's
relationship
with
the
complaining
member
to
let
him
know
as
quickly
as
possible
what
the
determination
was.
he
made
a
telephone
call,
he
wrote
a
brief
letter.
if
the
member
had
asked
for
further
information,
it
would
have
been
provided.
