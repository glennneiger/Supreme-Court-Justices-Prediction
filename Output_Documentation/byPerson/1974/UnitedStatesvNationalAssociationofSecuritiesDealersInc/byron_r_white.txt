justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
had
promulgated
a
rule
under
22
(f)
that
brokers
or
that
funds
should
restrict
the
transferability
of
their
share
so
that
brokers
as
well
as
dealers
couldn't
sell
to
investors
at
anything
less
than
the
offering
price.
would
you
--
i
suppose
your
argument
would
be
that
that
regulation
would
be
or
that
rule
would
be
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
argument
isn't
it
--
the
argument
on
the
other
side
i
take
it
among
other
things
is
that
that
commission
would
have
power
to
do
such
a
thing.
and
that
the
--
it's
the
commission
that
has
the
exclusive
power
to
deal
with
this
matter
and
that
the
power
the
commission
preempts
the
antitrust
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
commission
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
commission
is
now
asserting
it,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
suppose
the
fund
did
impose
this
restriction
and
the
commission
expressly
approved
it,
expressly
approved
those
restrictions
such
as
we've
been
talking
about.
i
would
--
i
suggest
the
commission
says
at
least
that
would
preempt
antitrust
to
the
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
is
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
say
they
could
do
that
and
if
they
could,
that
means
that
although
the
power
is
un-exercised,
the
power
is
there
and
it
should
not
be
interfered
with
by
antitrust
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
agree
mr.
norton
that
22
(d)
does
oust
the
antitrust
laws
with
respect
to
the
primary
market,
of
course
you
don't
attack,
you
don't
say
that
the
price
--
the
resale
price
maintenance
scheme
that
the
funds
that
the
underwriters
use
is
illegal?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
when
does
that
--
when
does
that
principal
market
end?
when
a
particular
share
has
been
bought
by
an
investor,
once
he
has
purchased
at
the
first
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
has
never
been
held
by
an
investor
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
say
the
primary
market
has
ended
and
he
should
be
able
to
sell
to
that
to
another
investor
either
through
a
broker
or
directly.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
without
any
--
without
any
interference
from.
justice
byron
r.
white
--
by
the
fund
or
the
underwriter
or
other
dealer.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
just
isn't
the
question
of
--
or
do
you
say
that
the
primary
market
just
can't
reach
out
and
keep
investors
from
selling
to
another
one
at
as
lower
price
even
though
the
fund
is
continuously
offering
its
new
share.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
problem
though
but
the
situation
would
still
exist,
but
perhaps
not
to
the
same
extent
that
even
if
there
was
no
sales
load
because
investors
may
want
to
sell,
another
people
may
buy
it
less
than
the
asset
value.
justice
byron
r.
white
an
investor
can
always
redeem
at
that
asset
value.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
he
may
have
to
pay
a
brokerage
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
he
does
know
any
other
investors.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
mr.
norton
that
the
antitrust(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you'll
get
to
it
but
you
--
wholly
aside
from
22
(f)
--
i
suppose
you're
saying
that
22
(d)
--
or
22
(d)
and
22
(f)
together
mean
that
the
primary
--
it
means
that
the
--
there
is
only
supposed
to
be
a
primary
market.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
wholly
aside
from
the
power
of
the
sec.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
we
disagreed
with
you
on
the
22
(d)
that
just
by
on
its
face
or
in
the
light
of
its
legislative
history,
22
(d)
standing
alone
didn't
eliminate
secondary
market
and
then
we
are
left
with
the
argument
that
the
powers
of
the
sec
under
22
(f)
are
sufficient
to
preempt
the
antitrust
laws
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
the
22
(f)
alone
has
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
don't
and
you
needn't
but
what
if
you
have
to?
and
what
if
we
--
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
get
it
clear.
let's
assume
that
an
investor
has
bought
some
shares
in
a
mutual
fund
and
he
wants
to
get
rid
of
it.
let's
assume
he
just
sells
to
a
dealer
and
the
dealer
buys
it
for
his
own
account.
now
if
he
does
that,
if
he
wants
to
sell
to
an
investor
he
must
sell
at
the
offering
price.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
an
investor
has
previously
held
though
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
my
question
though,
let's
assume
there
was
such
an
agreement,
is
that
exempted
by
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
part
of
the
government's
case
was
that
the
nasd
and
the
formal
system
was
suppressing
any
kind
of
a
development
of
secondary
market
through
brokers?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
suggesting
this
is
just
a
non-case.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
point
to?
do
you
suggest
that
the
government
has
abandoned
its
claims
on
the
count
i?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
that?
is
that
just
a
letter
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
do
say
that
there
is
a
--
there
are
agreements
which
have
this
effect
of
ousting
the
development
of
any
secondary
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
suggest
that
22
(d)
or
any
other
law
makes
it
illegal
for
a
broker
to
match
and
to
help
an
investor
sell
his
shares
to
another
one?
he
doesn't
violate
the
law,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
put
it
to
you
this
way.
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
doesn't
think
that
it's
illegal
for
a
broker
to
do
this
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
in
fact
they
have
the
contrary
opinion.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
so,
it's
not
illegal
for
--
in
their
opinion
for
a
broker
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
might
have
some
problem
if
the
complaint
was
alleged
to
charge
that
there
was
some
interference.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the
district
court
rule
that
section
22
(d)
or
22
(d)
and
22
(f)
together
just
preempts,
ousts
the
antitrust
laws
in
this
entire
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
even
if
there
was
something
to
aim
that
brokers
matching
investors,
the
antitrust
laws
would
still
be
irrelevant?
justice
byron
r.
white
nd
so
long
as
its
in
the
registration
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
well,
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
--
alright.
you're
suggesting
then
that
the
sec
would
interpret
the
act
to
exclude
that
kind
of
a
restriction.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
restrictions
of
which
the
act
wouldn't
permit
you
to
approve.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
i
want
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
very
well.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
rule,
does
nasd
purport
to
recommend
or
authorize
or
forbid
a
dealer
to
act
as
a
broker?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
part
of
your
cause
of
action
is
that
dealers
do
agree
not
to
act
as
brokers.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
attack
that.
