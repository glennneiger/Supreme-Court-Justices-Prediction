mr.
walter
p.
north
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sec
is
very
thankful
for
this
opportunity
to
participate
in
this
argument.
it
is
not
often
that
we
and
the
department
of
justice
disagree
and
having
done
so
in
this
instance
and
we
not
being
parties
to
the
case
and
they
are,
our
only
opportunity
to
be
heard
here
was
on
an
amicus
basis
and
we
appreciate
you
are
allowing
us
to
do
so.
having
listened
to
nearly
an
hour-and-a-half
of
argument
by
the
appellant
and
the
appellees,
i
see
no
need
at
this
stage
to
try
to
recap
the
whole
case.
i'm
going
to
confine
myself
instead
to
making
two
or
three
specific
points
which
i
think
are
significant
and
emphasize
and
enlarge
upon
a
little
the
way
it
was
put
by
the
other
counsel.
i
think
the
beginning
of
this
case
is
to
take
a
good
hard
look
at
the
nature
of
the
open
end
mutual
fund
business.
now,
between
the
government
counsel
and
counsel
for
the
litigants,
private
litigants,
you
had
a
rather
full
exposition
of
the
way
the
market
operates
and
quite
a
lot
said
about
the
legislative
history
but
i
think
the
starting
point
is
perhaps
even
back
of
that.
the
mutual
fund
shares
are
not
marketed
in
the
way
that
general
motors
stock
is.
you
don't
buy
it
in
the
market
place
at
an
auction.
the
mutual
fund
makes
a
continuous
offering
of
its
shares
which
it
has
to
do
in
order
to
meet
the
redemptions
which
the
law
requires
it
to
make.
in
order
to
make
continuous
sales
of
mutual
fund
shares,
there
has
to
be
a
primary
distribution
system
that
will
hopefully
keep
up
their
new
sales
parallel
with
if
not
in
excess
of
their
redemptions.
if
you
don't
have
that
result,
the
fund
is
going
to
be
forced
into
a
gradual
liquidation
and
eventually
will
have
to
go
out
of
business.
i
think
that
when
you
bear
that
in
mind,
it
puts
the
importance
of
the
primary
distribution
system
that
congress
has
seen
fit
to
try
to
protect
in
a
much
stronger
light
than
you
might
otherwise
consider
it.
i
think
it's
very
important
that
we
do
take
that
into
account.
now,
i'd
like
next
to
touch
upon
one
aspect
of
the
government's
argument
which
i
think
is
highly
technical
and
exults
form
over
substance.
they
say
that
the
contracts
that
exist
between
the
fund
and
the
underwriter
and
in
turn
between
the
underwriter
and
the
contract
dealers
are
not
sustainable
under
section
22
(f)
as
being
restrictions
on
transferability.
they
say
apparently
that
you
have
to
have
something
that's
written
on
the
face
of
the
stock
certificate
or
expressed
in
some
other
way
but
as
long
as
these
contracts
are
filed
with
the
sec
as
they
are
and
always
have
been
since
the
1940
act
was
adopted
and
as
long
as
they
are
incorporated
into
the
registration
statement
i
can
see
no
basis
for
saying
that
they
don't
fully
comply
with
section
22
(f).
mr.
walter
p.
north
doesn't
look
at
them,
you
say?
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
that
makes
any
difference
one
way
or
another.
mr.
walter
p.
north
well,
it
started
i
would
say
with
1941
when
we
first
reviewed
the
nasd's
initial
rules
that
were
adopted
pursuant
to
this
section
of
the
statute.
mr.
walter
p.
north
we
have
not
adopted
any
specific
rule
under
22
(f).
mr.
walter
p.
north
well,
i'm
not
even
doing
it
today.as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
exercised
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
we
have
proposals
right
now
that
we're
working
on
to
go
to
congress
with
to
change
some
of
these
things
by
statute
rather
than
just
by
a
regulation
of
our
own
and
we
in
the
meantime
have
specifically
requested
the
nasd
just
last
november
to
adopt
a
rule
which
would
loosen
up
to
some
extent
the
right
of
others
to
participate
in
the
market
of
mutual
fund
shares
as
distinguished
from
limiting
it
to
the
primary
distribution
that
we
now
have.
but,
the
commission
has
exercised
cast
surveillance
in
this
whole
area
all
throughout
the
history
of
the
investment
company
act.
the
only
thing
it
hasn't
done
is
to
adapt
a
specific
rule
under
22
(f)
because
it
has
never
found
occasion
to
take
exception
to
the
nasd's
rules
in
this
area
which
it
has
carefully
reviewed
and
kept
track
of
and
commented
upon
from
time
to
time.
indeed,
the
joint
appendix
here
contains
some
conferences
between
the
representatives
of
the
commission
in
the
nasd
which
show
that
there
was
mutual
consultation
on
the
limits
of
these
things
and
what
should
be
done
in
these
areas.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
important
thing
here
is
that
the
nasd
and
its
members
have
consistently
since
both
before
and
after
the
1940
act
conducted
a
primary
distribution
system
that
was
based
upon
contracts
which
contain
these
provisions.
these
contracts
are
on
file
with
the
commission
as
a
part
of
the
registration
statement
which
is
what
just
what
22
(f)
says
as
it
should
be.
mr.
walter
p.
north
the
commission
has
approved
the
portion
of
that
contract
which
you
are
mentioning.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that's
right.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that's
right.
those
are
all
restrictions
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
am
saying
your
honor
that
we
haven't
disapproved
them,
22
f
permits
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
yes,
certainly.
mr.
walter
p.
north
22
(d)
22
(f)
reads,
no
registered
open
end
companies
shall
restrict
the
transferability
of
any
security
of
which
it
is
the
issue
except
in
conformity
with
the
statements
with
respect
to
contained
in
this
registration
statement
which
statements
are
not
in
contradiction
of
any
rule
of
the
commission.
mr.
walter
p.
north
we're
saying
that
restrictions
on
transferability
of
the
shares
of
an
issuer
are
unobjectionable
from
the
standpoint
of
the
antitrust
laws
if
--
as
long
as
they
are
contained
in
the
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
no.
mr.
walter
p.
north
because
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
maybe
i
didn't
understand
the
question,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
walter
p.
north
that's
undoubtly
so
but
i'm
not
at
all
sure
about
what
we
wouldn't
disapprove
it
if
they
went
that
far.
in
other
words,
i
think
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
--
that
congress
has
vested
the
authority
in
the
commission
to
do
that.
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
think
we
would
say
that
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
the
act
from
its
--
us
to
approve
only
once
if
we
feel
are
in
the
best
interest
of
the
shareholders
and
the
investing
public
in
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
and
that's
exactly
where
we
think
the
authority
in
this
area
lies
as
against
lying
in
the
hands
of
an
antitrust
court
which
wants
to
do
the
ruling
for
the
commission
in
this
area.
mr.
walter
p.
north
now
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
p.
north
i
think
the
commission
has
adequate
authority
to
require
compliance.
we're
sending
that
letter
to
the
nasd
to
give
them
the
first
opportunity
to
move
in
this
area
if
they
see
fit
to
do
so.
and
i'm
not
at
all
sure
but
what
the
commission
--
if
the
nasd
did
not
see
fit
to
do
so,
wouldn't
either
compel
them
to
do
it
or
enact
a
rule
of
its
own
to
that
same
effect.
mr.
walter
p.
north
under
that
or
under
6
(c)
or
under
30
(a),
there
are
several
sections
of
the
act
that
gives
the
commission
a
rulemaking
authority
that
i
think
would
cover
this
kind
of
a
situation.
there
are
some
kinds
of
situations
that
we
don't
think
our
rulemaking
authority
covers.
we're
working
right
now
on
a
draft
to
some
legislation.
we're
going
to
submit
to
congress
to
--
too
broad
in
our
powers
in
some
of
these
respects.
and
someone
asked
the
question
earlier
in
the
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
we
had
any
reaction
from
congress
as
a
result
of
the
report
we
submitted
last
november,
some
130
or
140
pages
long.
the
answer
is
that
there
--
the
committees
of
the
congress
are
still
waiting
for
us
to
send
over
a
draft
to
actual
bills
that
do
incorporate
or
implement
some
of
these
suggestions
that
are
made
in
this
report.
so
the
commission
is
actively
studying
this
whole
situation.
has
some
ideas
of
its
own
that
indicate
that
maybe
this
system
as
it
is
now
isn't
perfect
and
maybe
it
needs
some
changes,
maybe
it
needs
some
changes,
maybe
it
needs
some
relaxing.
but
they
want
to
go
about
it
in
a
cautious,
judicious
manner
and
not
just
chop
it
off
by
an
antitrust
court
decree
that
says
the
whole
primary
distribution
system
no
longer
needs
any
protection
which
is
i
think
virtually
where
you
might
end
up
if
you
had
an
antitrust
court
decision
in
favor
of
the
government
in
this
case.
incidentally,
i
would
like
--
and
i
see
my
time
is
nearly
up,
i
would
like
to
close
by
referring
him
to
an
excerpt
from
this
commission
report
that
i'm
--
that
we
sent
over
to
congress
just
last
november.
on
the
very
last
page
of
the
government's
--
the
department
of
justice's
reply
brief,
they
quote
what
they
say
is
a
sentence
out
of
this
report.
incidentally,
this
report
is
a
report
by
the
staff
to
the
commission.
it
isn't
the
commission's
own
report
though
they
say
the
commission
has
made
this
observation
and
they
say
we
made
this
observation
in
a
related
context.
here
is
what
they
say
we
said
to
the
congress
in
that
report.
and
as
far
as
it
goes,
i
don't
see
it's
an
act,
it's
word
for
word,
the
way
our
report
reads.
it
says
that
an
exaggerated
fear
of
disorderly
distribution
should
not
be
permitted
before
my
pretext
for
avoiding
the
introduction
of
price
competition
which
--
while
perhaps
difficult
and
even
unprofitable
for
particular
funds
and
their
underwriters
and
certain
dealers
would
be
to
the
benefit
of
an
investors
and
the
mutual
fund
industry
generally.
now,
the
thing
that
the
government's
brief
does
not
do
is
--
include
the
first
word
of
that
sentence
which
was
however,
it's
a
however
sentence.
and
a
however
sentence
by
its
very
nature
assumes
that
you
are
distinguishing
something
that
just
went
before.
here
is
the
sentence
before
the
“however
sentence”
which
they
quote
without
the
however,
“there
is
of
course
a
necessity
to
avoid
disruption
of
the
fund
distribution
system.”
and
then
it
goes
on
“however”
and
then
they
say
this,
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
they
have
transmitted
it
to
the
congress.
they're
working
now
on
a
draft,
to
some
legislation
to
implement
parts
of
it.
we
have
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
there
was
an
extensive
letter
of
transmittal
signed
by
the
chairman
of
the
commission
and
authorized
by
the
whole
commission,
some
eight
pages
in
length,
single
spaced
stating
the
commission's
own
reaction
and
sustaining
some
of
the
recommendations
of
the
staff.
mr.
walter
p.
north
well,
no.
there
have
been
proposals
up
in
--
and
a
number
of
other
congress
--
there
were
proposed
--
mr.
walter
p.
north
oh,
no.
the
commission
in
1967
and
again
in
1969
had
proposals
before
the
congress
was
--
including
some
modifications
of
this
section
22,
the
very
section
we're
talking
about.
mr.
walter
p.
north
22
(f),
no.
they've
never
adopted
--
formed
a
rule.
i
would
suggest
one
other
thing
and
i'll
be
through
that
this
quotation
that
i
just
read
is
in
a
portion
of
the
commission's
report
which
is
recommending
legislative
proposals.
and
yet,
they
say
was
made
--
their
statement
in
a
related
context,
i
would
say
this
is
just
the
opposite
context.
the
context
of
what
you
think
the
law
is
and
the
lawsuit
of
one
thing.
the
context
of
what
you
want
when
you
go
to
congress
to
get
the
change
in
the
law
is
quite
a
different
thing.
thank
you
very
much.
