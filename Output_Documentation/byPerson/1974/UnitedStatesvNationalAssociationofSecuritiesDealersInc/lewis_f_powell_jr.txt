justice
lewis
f.
powell,

mr.
norton
has
there
been
any
congressional
reaction
to
that
74
study?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
norton,
would
you
summarize
very
briefly
the
essential
difference
between
count
i
what
the
government
is
driving
out
there
as
contrasted
with
the
practical
consequences
of
what
it
is
seeking
in
the
other
counts.
suppose
you
won
on
count
i
and
lost
on
the
others
and
vice
versa,
what
are
the
results
of
this?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
specifically
what
types
of
agreements
would
count
i
address
that
are
different
from
the
agreements
addressed
by
the
other
counts.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
information
like
that
violates
the
antitrust
laws
if
it
were
erroneous.
in
other
words
both
the
brokers
and
dealers
would
have
lawyers
to
advice
them
whether
or
not
the
nsad
information
was
correct
or
not.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
norton,
i
thought
that
clients
did
offer
continuously
or
because
they
are
obligated
to
buy
back
continuously.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
there
must
be
a
liquidation.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
pertaining
to
a
question
that
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
earlier,
isn't
that
fundamental
problem
to
the
extent
of
the
load
and
the
scc
does
have
authority
to
regulate
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
if
the
law
were
fair,
what
would
be
the
advantage
of
having
the
secondary
--
the
pre-secondary
market
that
you
speak
of?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
north.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
the
commission's
letter
of
november
22
to
the
nasd,
you
framed
a
request
that
certain
be
accomplished.
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
nasd
said,
“no,
we
don't
agree
with
the
commission.
we're
not
going
to
make
those
changes.”
in
your
opinion,
does
the
commission
have
authority
on
the
22
(f)
or
any
other
section
of
the
act
to
require
compliance?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
you'd
enact
such
a
rule
under
22
(f)?
