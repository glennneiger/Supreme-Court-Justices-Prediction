but
they
don't
compete
in
terms
of
the
load
percentage?
justice
potter
stewart
you
say,
there
are
some
with
the
open-end
investment
companies
with
the
zero
load?
justice
potter
stewart
i
knew
that
they
were
closed
down,
no
load
funds.
justice
potter
stewart
so
where
is
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
can
that
economically
be?
justice
potter
stewart
that
became
the
proposal
that
this
problem
will
be
dealt
with
my
forward
pricing.
justice
potter
stewart
a
special
investor
just
wants
to
sell
his
shares
to
a
friend
and
they
say
why
would
you
split
the
difference
between
the
redemption
cost
and
the
offering?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
he
goes
through
a
broker
it
isn't
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
assume
that
you
may
be
right
that
it
hardly
ever
happens
but
are
you
saying
that
the
act
22
(d)
and
22
(f)
would
exempt
the
nasd
from
any
antitrust
liability
and
the
brokers
if
they
all
agreed
that
we
will
just
ever
help
an
investor
sell
to
another
investor?
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
this
part
here,
you
are
suggesting
that
the
sec
by
not
disapproving
any
of
these
agreements
has
in
effect
proved
a
contract
between
for
example,
between
a
contract
dealer
and
a
underwriter
that
the
dealer
will
never
act
as
a
broker
between
two
investors.
justice
potter
stewart
your
answer
is
yes,
and
that
there
are
such
agreements
in
existence
where
the
people
participating
in
the
primary
submission
system
agree
that
they
want
brokerage.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
underwriter
agrees
with
the
mutual
fund
that
his
contract
dealers
want
brokerage.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that
you
have
approved
those
agreements
therefore
they
are
exempted
from
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
the
a
fortiori,
if
you
would
approve
them
you
say
that's
the
example.
justice
potter
stewart
but
what's
essential
to
the
operation
to
the
act?
where
do
you
find
in
the
act
any
authorization
for
approving
or
for
exempting
that
kind
of
a
contract
management
form?
put
your
finger
right
on
it
in
this
act,
in
the
--
in
section
22
(d)
or
(f).
justice
potter
stewart
well,
yes.
you're
saying
that
under
(f),
under
(f)
--
any
kind
of
agreement
known
to
man,
as
long
as
you
don't
approve
it
is
perfectly
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
that
it
could
--
you
could
say
that
the
stock
could've
honored
and
they
have
enforceable
and
then
one
investor
couldn't
sell
to
another.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
why
wouldn't
you
as
you
didn't
disapprove
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
evidence
in
the
registration
statement
and
if
its
not
disapproved
by
the
sec,
i
think
your
answer
would
be
yes
under
22
(f).
justice
potter
stewart
or
you
would
say
that
such
a
restriction
on
the
sale
from
one
investor
to
another
would
be
--
not
only,
it
would
certainly
wouldn't
--
it
wouldn't
be
anything
wrong
with
that
as
long
as
you
didn't
disapprove
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
