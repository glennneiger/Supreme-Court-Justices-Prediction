justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
thing
you've
just
put
on
mr.
norton,
is
that
in
the
record
or
is
this
just
illustrative?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
clear
that
the
language,
the
word
dealer
in
22
(d)
does
not
apply
to
a
broker
as
well?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
when
you
were
describing
the
functions
--
those
functions
are
descriptions
contained
in
the
statute
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
one
of
your
arguments
that
a
secondary
market
would
benefit
the
holders
of
this
security?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
when
this
22
(f)
says
the
commission
has
to
act
in
the
interest
of
all
the
holders
wouldn't
it
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
fact
if
you're
right
that
a
secondary
market
would
benefit
some
of
the
holders?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
this
has
been
going
on
for
35
years,
why
did
the
government
wait
so
long
to
bring
this
suit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
happened
that
in
the
early
60's
that
made
it
more
clear?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
to
the
load
factors
in
your
open
fund
vary
--
they're
not
all
7.5%.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
the
government
says
part
of
the
reason
it
has
disappeared
is
because
of
the
agreements
among
your
clients.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
assuming
mr.
norton
in
his
response
to
justice
powell's
question
didn't
indicate
that
the
government
had
withdrawn
count
i.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
--
you
know
when
you
talk
about
someone
withdrawing
a
portion
of
their
case,
i
would
assume
you
take
their
word
rather
than
opposing
counsel's
ordinarily.
