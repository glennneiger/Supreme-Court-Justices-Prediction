well,
the
first
one
mr.
justice
powell's
opinion,
he
being
absent
today,
in
united
states
against
national
association
of
securities
dealers.
the
united
states
brought
this
antirust
action
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
to
challenge
certain
sales
and
distribution
practices
commonly
used
in
the
sales
of
securities
of
mutual
fund
companies.
the
complaint
alleged
that
the
nasd
in
certain
mutual
funds
and
underwriters
and
broker-dealers
had
conspired
to
restrict
trading
in
mutual-fund
shares.
united
states
charge
that
various
agreements
had
imposed
vertical
and
horizontal
restrictions
on
the
market
for
mutual-fund
shares
with
the
result
that
secondary
market
trading
was
discouraged
to
a
greater
extent
than
contemplated
by
congress
when
it
enacted
the
investment
company
act
of
1940.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint,
finding
that
the
challenged
activities
were
immunized
from
antitrust
liability
by
sections
22
(d)
and
(f)
of
the
investment
company
act.
it
further
found
that
apart
from
this
specific
immunity,
the
pervasive
regulatory
scheme
established
by
the
investment
company
act
and
the
maloney
act
displaced
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
field
of
the
sales
and
distribution
of
mutual-fund
shares.
the
court
today
affirms
although
on
somewhat
different
grounds.
we
agree
with
the
united
states
that
the
challenged
practices
are
not
immunized
by
section
22
(d)
of
the
investment
company
act.
that
section
which
requires
the
dealers
maintain
an
established
price
in
most
mutual-fund
shares
does
not
extend
the
sales
in
which
the
dealers
acts
in
a
capacity
of
broker
rather
than
as
a
statutorily
defined
dealer.
the
statute
defines
its
terms
carefully
and
we
find
no
justification
for
expanding
the
mandate
of
section
22
(d).
we
further
conclude,
however,
that
the
challenges
to
the
alleged
vertical
restrictions
on
the
marketing
practices
are
immunized
by
section
22
(f)
of
the
act.
that
section
authorizes
the
funds
to
impose
restrictions
on
the
transferability
and
negotiability
of
mutual
fund-shares
provided
they
are
properly
disclosed
and
do
not
contravene
sec
regulations.
our
examination
of
the
history
of
the
investment
company
act
persuades
moreover,
that
congress
intended
to
authorize
the
imposition
of
limitations
on
the
distribution
system
as
well
as
on
the
actual
shares
themselves.
the
primary
evils
to
which
the
act
was
addressed
were
problems
of
that
distribution
system
and
it
would
be
artificial
indeed
to
prevent
the
sec
and
industry
from
addressing
those
problems
at
their
source.
moreover,
our
determination
that
these
limitations
are
authorized
by
the
investment
company
act
necessarily
requires
that
they
be
immunized
from
antirust
liability
for
we
can
see
no
way
to
reconcile
sec
approval
of
these
practices
with
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
finally,
we
conclude
that
the
alleged
horizontal
restrictions
on
the
marketing
and
mutual-fund
shares
are
immunized
by
pervasive
regulatory
schemes
of
the
maloney
and
investment
company
acts.
the
activities
here
challenged
are
related
to
and
are
supportive
of
those
immunized
by
section
22
(f)
of
the
investment
company
act.
subjecting
them
to
antitrust
liability
would
lead
to
possibly
inconsistent
and
conflicting
judgments
between
the
courts
and
the
sec
that
would
limit
the
commissions'
flexible
mandate
to
regulate
the
mutual-fund
industry.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
justices,
douglas
and
brennan,
and
marshall.
