mr.
gerald
p.
norton
mr.
chief
justice,
here's
a
chart
that
i'll
be
using
in
the
course
of
the
argument
which
i
would
like
to
have
set
up
before
i
proceed.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes,
copies
have
been
handed
up
to
the
court.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it's
just
illustrative.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
granting
the
defendants
motion
to
dismiss
the
government's
complaint
in
a
sherman
act
case.
the
case
involves
interpretation
of
several
provisions
of
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
concerning
mutual
funds
and
the
relationship
of
that
act
to
the
antitrust
laws.
in
reviewing
the
many
briefs,
we
found
some
confusion
in
terminology
and
some
misapprehension
of
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
so
we've
tried
to
address
some
of
those
problems
in
the
reply
brief
we
filed
last
week
and
we've
also
prepared
this
illustrative
chart
which
i
think
may
help
clarify
some
of
the
relationships
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
basically,
a
mutual
fund
or
an
investment
company
is
a
company
that
invests
shareholder's
money
in
the
stock
of
other
companies.
this
case
involves
the
most
common
type
of
mutual
fund
which
is
the
“open
end”
mutual
fund.
its
distinctive
characteristics
are
that
share
are
always
redeemable
by
the
shareholder
from
the
fund
at
a
proportional
amount
of
the
net
asset
value
of
the
funds
at
the
time
of
redemption.
although
they
are
not
required
to
do
so
by
law,
funds
most
of
them
are
continually
offering
shares
to
the
public.
some
however
have
for
either
short-term
or
long-term
periods
stopped
offering
and
are
closed
up
as
they
say.
there
are
two
basic
types
of
open
end
mutual
funds,
the
load
funds
and
no
load
funds.
the
load
refers
to
a
sales
charge
that
the
purchaser
pays
at
the
time
of
purchase.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
issues
here
involve
only
the
load
funds
and
it
is
to
those
load
open
end
mutual
funds
that
i
will
be
referring
throughout.
in
the
initial
distribution
of
mutual
fund
shares,
we
have
the
vertical
alignment
shown
in
the
center
of
the
chart.
the
mutual
fund
distributes
its
share
to
a
single
underwriter
known
as
the
principal
underwriter
pursuant
to
an
underwriting
contract.
then
the
underwriter
typically
sells
those
shares
to
a
large
number
of
dealers
through
dealer
contracts.
we've
only
shown
one
in
the
chart
for
illustration
but
there
would
be
many
of
these
in
the
ordinary
scheme.
then
the
contract
dealer,
as
that
dealer
is
known,
sells
the
shares
to
the
public
to
investors.
investor
can
then
redeem
directly
from
the
fund
or
it
can
also
redeem
by
going
through
the
dealer
or
the
underwriter,
although
we
have
not
shown
that
path
here.
now,
this
is
called
the
primary
distribution
system
in
the
mutual
fund
industry.
there
is
also
a
secondary
market
and
transactions
involving
mutual
funds
as
with
any
other
securities.
now
in
the
ordinary
securities
market,
the
secondary
market
is
the
one
of
most
importance
to
investors
that
is
where
issued
shares
are
traded
on
stock
exchange.
a
secondary
market
provides
alternatives
to
the
primary
distribution
system
for
an
investor
if
wishing
to
buy
or
sell
shares.
now
if
the
investor
can
purchase
from
either
a
contract
dealer
or
another
dealer
or
from
an
investor
either
going
through
a
broker
or
directly.
and
because
of
the
nature
of
the
securities
business,
a
security's
firm
will
be
acting
in
various
capacities
depending
on
the
transaction
involved.
the
same
firm
can
at
different
times
and
different
transactions
be
a
broker
mean
that
it's
acting
as
an
agent
in
the
purchase
or
sale
of
securities
whereas
a
dealer
meaning
that
it's
acting
as
a
principle
for
its
own
account
and
if
it
has
a
contract
with
respect
to
the
shares
involved,
there
would
be
a
contract
dealer
and
as
to
those
shares
for
which
it
has
no
contract,
it
would
be
a
non-contract
dealer.n
ow,
although
the
chart
here
shows
contract
dealer,
non
contract
dealer
and
broker
is
three
separate
categories,
the
same
firm
could
be
in
all
three
of
those
categories
as
to
different
transactions.
the
term
“broker-dealer”
is
used
generically
to
refer
to
any
firm
in
the
security's
business
as
either
a
broker
or
a
dealer.
nearly
all
broker-dealers
are
members
of
the
defendant
national
association
of
securities
dealers.
that
is
the
only
association
that
has
been
registered
under
the
maloney
act
of
1938
which
amended
the
securities
exchange
act.
that
provides
a
measure
of
industry
self
government
subject
to
the
oversight
of
the
securities
exchange
commission
under
rules
adopted
by
and
reviewed
by
the
commission
covering
specified
subjects.
none
of
the
rules
of
the
nasd
are
involved
directly
in
this
case.
now,
section
22
(d)
of
the
investment
company
act
provides
in
relevant
part
that
if
a
mutual
fund
is
currently
offering
its
shares
to
the
public
then
no
principal
underwriter
and
no
dealer
may
sell
shares
of
that
fund
to
any
person
except
another
dealer,
underwriter
or
the
fund,
except
that
the
public
offering
price
described
in
the
perspectives,
i'll
return
to
that
public
offering
price
in
a
moment.
also
involved
in
this
case
is
section
22
(f)
of
the
investment
company
act
which
provides
that
no
mutual
fund
may
restrict
the
transferability
or
negotiability
of
its
shares
except
in
conformity
with
the
statements
made
with
respect
thereto
in
its
registration
statement
and
not
in
contravention
of
any
rules
prescribed
by
the
commission
in
the
interest
of
the
holders
of
all
outstanding
shares.
22
(d)
has
no
direct
effect
on
the
price
of
mutual
fund
shares,
i'm
sorry,
22
(f)
has
no
direct
effect,
22
(d)
does
as
i'll
illustrate.
if
the
fund
is
currently
offering
its
shares
to
the
public,
there's
no
dispute
that
the
price
to
an
investor
charged
by
a
dealer
must
be
the
public
offering
price
price
described
in
the
perspectives
whether
that's
a
contract
dealer
or
a
non-contract
dealer.
now
that
price
is
effectively
the
net
asset
value
of
the
proportional
amount
of
the
net
asset
value
of
the
fund
plus
a
sales
load
designated
by
the
fund.
typically,
that
is
a
maximum
of
8.5%
of
the
total
amount
paid.
now
the
price
from
the
underwriter
to
the
dealer
is
governed
by
the
dealer
contract
and
that
is
typically
the
public
offering
price
less
a
dealer
discount
which
for
8.5%
sales
load
would
typically
be
7%.
the
price
to
the
underwriter
from
the
fund
would
be
net
asset
value
meaning
that
the
underwriter
gets
a
net
of
the
1.5%
difference
between
public
offering
price
and
its
price
to
the
dealer.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes.
there
are
other
provisions
of
the
act
which
provide
means
regulation
of
the
sales
load,
other
provisions
of
section
22.
now,
there
is
also
no
dispute
that
the
act
places
no
limitation
on
the
price
that
one
investor
can
charge
another
for
shares
of
the
fund.
it's
competitive
market
price
there.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
range
is
likely
to
be
between
net
asset
value
that
the
selling
investor
can
get
from
the
fund
on
redemption
and
the
public
offering
price
that
the
buying
investor
could
get
the
shares
for
from
a
dealer.
there's
also
no
limitation
on
the
price
that
an
investor
can
get
from
a
sale
to
a
dealer.
now
by
its
terms,
22
(d)
does
not
apply
to
sales
by
one
dealer
to
another.
this
is
the
so-called
interdealer
market.
and
22
(d)
also
does
not
impose
any
restrictions
by
its
terms
on
sales
by
a
broker
to
anyone.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
those
terms
are
separately
defined
and
as
i've
indicated
the
same
--
any
broker-dealer
is
at
various
times
a
broker
or
a
dealer,
someone
who
was
acting
in
a
brokerage
capacity
would
not
be
governed
by
22
(d).
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
they
are
in
part
contained
in
the
statute
and
in
part
a
description
of
the
industry
as
it
operates
and
as
it
has
been
characterized
by
the
commission
to
which
i'll
come
in
a
moment.
now
unlike
the
markets
for
other
securities,
the
market
for
mutual
funds
is
almost
entirely
this
primary
distribution
system.
there
are
no
really,
no
secondary
markets
for
mutual
fund
shares.
there's
a
tiny
interdealer
market.
there's
no
dealer
market
of
sales
to
investors
and
is
virtually
no
brokerage
market.
therefore,
at
present
the
investor
has
as
a
practical
matter,
no
choice
but
to
buy
at
the
public
offering
price
and
to
sell
at
net
asset
value.
with
the
development
of
computer
technology,
the
potential
impact
or
importance
of
a
brokerage
market
has
been
somewhat
enhanced
and
it's
possible
to
match
buy
and
sell
orders
in
a
brokerage
transaction
in
a
way
that
has
not
always
been
so.
but
secondary
interdealer
and
brokerage
markets
have
not
developed
because
in
large
part
they
have
been
restrained
by
agreements,
provisions
in
underwriting
agreements
and
dealer
agreements
which
effectively
either
fix
the
price
at
which
such
transactions
must
occur
thereby
removing
any
competitive
incentive
or
preclude
brokers,
dealers
and
underwriters
from
engaging
in
them.
the
validity
of
those
agreements
is
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
now,
the
case
is
here
in
motion
to
dismiss
so
that
the
allegations
that
the
complaint
of
course
must
be
accepted
as
true
and
construed.
the
government's
favor
in
determining
whether
there's
any
state
of
facts
that
the
government
might
prove
that
would
entitle
it
to
any
relief.
not
necessarily
the
precise
relief
requested
in
the
complaint
but
any
relief.
although
there
are
some
variations,
the
essence
of
counts
ii,
iv,
vi
and
viii
is
that
underwriters
and
dealers
have
included
in
their
dealer
contracts
various
restrictive
provisions
which
either
require
the
dealers
to
act
as
dealers
in
their
transactions
therefore
subjecting
themselves
to
the
fixed
price
of
22
(d),
or
that
if
they
do
act
as
brokers
required
that
they
maintained
that
fixed
price
or
preclude
them
from
dealing
with
other
broker-dealers.
counts
iii,
v,
and
vii
allege
that
mutual
funds
have
engaged
and
entered
into
underwriting
agreements
containing
provisions
that
either
require
the
underwriters
to
impose
these
restrictive
provisions
in
their
dealer
contracts
or
have
imposed
other
restraints
on
the
underwriter's
ability
to
engage
in
competitive
transactions.
count
i
of
the
complaint
alleges
that
nasd
and
its
members
including
underwriters
and
broker-dealers
have
combined
to
restrain
the
development
of
competitive
secondary
inter-dealer
markets
and
brokerage
markets
through
a
variety
of
means.
and
let
me
make
it
clear
that
when
we
talk
about
a
secondary
dealer
market
in
the
complaint
and
in
this
case,
we're
talking
about
the
market
between
dealers,
contract
dealer
to
a
non
contract
dealer
or
an
investor
sale
to
a
dealer.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
dealer's
sale
to
an
investor.
some
suggested
on
the
other
side
that
that
is
the
market
we
are
trying
to
develop
or
redevelop
in
this
case.
that
is
not
true.
as
the
complaint
was
later
clarified,
we
are
not
challenging
in
the
complaint
any
rules
adopted
by
the
nasd.
it
is
asserted
that
those
rules
deal
only
with
the
primary
distribution
system
and
the
complaint
here
is
directed
at
the
secondary
markets.
and
none
of
these
restrictions
that
we
are
challenging
is
required
by
any
rule
of
the
commission
or
of
any
rule
of
the
nasd.
the
defendants
acknowledged
that
they
have
the
burden
of
establishing
some
implied
exception
to
the
antitrust
laws
because
there's
no
expressed
exception.
and
they
therefore
must
overcome
the
strong
presumption
against
implied
repeal
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
this
effort,
they
contend
that
22
(d)
was
intended
by
congress
to
eradicate
secondary
markets
that
had
existed
prior
to
1940
and
to
require
that
all
transactions
and
mutual
fund
shares
be
at
the
fixed
prices.
they
also
claimed
that
congress
intended
section
22
(f)
to
permit
the
funds,
underwriters
and
dealers
to
make
private
arrangements
which
would
restrict
any
other
competition
in
this
secondary
market
area
that
was
not
precluded
by
22
(d).
building
on
these
premises,
the
defendants
claim
that
the
entire
distribution,
sale
and
redemption
process
of
mutual
fund
sales
including
secondary
market
transactions
is
covered
by
an
implied
immunity
because
of
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
they
say
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
the
district
court
agreed
and
granted
their
motion
to
dismiss.
we
should
note
that
the
district
court
did
not
deal
with
any
of
the
factual
submissions
made
by
the
parties
on
various
aspects
of
the
case
and
treated
the
motion
as
raising
strictly
legal
questions
and
the
various
factual
issues
are
of
course
not
before
the
court.
but
we
don't
believe
that
the
language
of
section
22
(d)
with
its
plain
inapplicability
to
inter-dealer
transactions
or
the
broker
transactions
or
the
language
of
22
(f)
will
bear
the
weight
of
the
defendant's
argument
as
to
its
sweeping
purpose
and
effect.
our
more
limited
reading
of
these
sections
is
confirmed
by
their
legislative
history.
and
i
think
it's
important
to
place
the
act
in
context.
the
defendants
would
have
the
court
think
that
the
act
was
enacted
because
mutual
funds
wanted
protection
from
the
secondary
market
competition
which
they
were
troubled
by.
it's
quite
contrary
that
the
act
was
thrust
upon
the
industry
as
a
response
to
revelation
of
a
variety
of
abuses
that
had
developed
by
funds
in
the
1920's
and
‘30s.
1939,
the
sec
submitted
to
congress
a
study,
3500
page
study,
the
result
of
four
years
of
intensive
investigation
which
revealed
a
wide
variety
of
abuses
by
mutual
funds.
and
the
principal
abuses
are
reflected
in
the
congress's
findings
in
section
1
(b)
of
the
act
involve
such
matters
as
inadequate
disclosure
to
investors,
discriminatory
treatment
of
different
classes
of
investors,
favoritism
of
insiders
as
undue
speculation.
they're
all
abuses
of
the
mutual
funds.
there's
not
a
single
one
that
involves
abuses
by
a
secondary
market
dealers,
which
the
–
other
side
would
have
the
court
believe
was
the
target
of
the
act.
defendant's
reference
to
the
legislative
history
is
rather
dubious
because
they
can
cite
no
single
instance
in
which
any
person
said
that
22
(d)
or
22
(f)
was
aimed
at
restricting
the
secondary
market.
in
the
course
of
the
vast
investment
company
study,
there
is
a
half
of
page,
a
single
paragraph
which
we've
quoted
in
its
entirety,
page
32
of
our
brief
which
refers
to
what
the
industry,
not
the
commission
called
a
“bootleg
market.”
this
was
a
market
involving
some
secondary
market
dealers
who
would
be
buying
at
somewhat
above
the
net
asset
value
and
selling
at
somewhat
below
the
public
offering
price.
and
as
the
report
stated,
they
started
a
small
price
war.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
hasn't
been
presented.
on
the
face
of
it
i
think
that
would
go
beyond
the
power
the
commission
has
under
22
(f)
and
in
any
event
they
have
not
done
so.
it
is
clear
that
these
restrictions
are
not
the
result
of
any
rule
that
the
commission
has
promulgated.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
the
argument.
one
problem
with
that
argument
is
that
the
commission
prior
to
this
case
never
exercised
its
authority
under
22
(f)
in
any
respect.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it
never
indicated
in
any
way
that
it
had
the
expansive
view
of
it's
jurisdiction
that
the
defendants
and
to
some
extent
the
commission
now
claim.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it's
not
saying
that
it
could
require
the
industry
to
impose
its
restrictive
agreement.
it's
saying
that
it
has
some
authority
to
regulate
them
because
it
says
these
agreements
maybe
treated
as
if
they
were
restrictions
on
the
transferability
of
the
shares.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well
i
suspect
that
would
be
their
position.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well
they
haven't
expressly
approved
them.
so
they
can't
really
take
that
position.
but
i
think
their
position
leads
in
that
direction
but
we
would
not
agree.
because
that
would
present
the
different
case
referred
to
in
silver
as
to
which
the
court
has
not
given
any
definitive
answer.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well
that's
true
because
this
involves
several
problems.
one
is
that
they're
trying
to
convert
agency
in
action
into
some
evidence
of
affirmative
approval
and
that
is
something
that
there's
no
basis
for
here.
if
the
commission
had
been
exercising
a
broad
jurisdiction
under
22
(f)
and
had
been
actually
reviewing
these
agreements
since
1940
and
passing
some
kind
of
relevant
judgment
on
them,
they
might
have
a
stronger
argument.
but
the
fact
is
that
they
were
not.
that
this
--
that
the
restrictive
agreements
are
contained
in
underwriting
and
dealer
contracts,
not
in
the
registration
statements.
they're
filed
with
those
statements
but
they
are
not
reviewed
in
anyway
that
is
relevant
to
whether
there
should
be
an
antitrust
immunity.
in
fact
if
we
look
at
22
(f),
the
standard
under
22
(f)
is
extremely
narrow,
it's
not
the
question
of
whether
restrictions
are
in
the
public
interest.
the
commission
is
authorized
to
prescribe
regulations
in
the
interest
of
all
holders
of
outstanding
shares.
now
that
may
or
may
not
involve
any
competitive
implications.
and
this
court
has
never
found
an
implied
immunity
based
on
agency
review
or
agency
jurisdiction
where
the
agency
hasn't
had
to
give
some
consideration
to
antitrust
or
competitive
considerations.
and
there
is
no
--
nothing
on
the
face
of
22
(f)
that
requires
the
commission
to
do
so.
now
whether
22
(f)
might
be
construed
to
authorize
that
broad
review
is
another
matter
but
it's
perfectly
clear.
that
it
has
not
been
so
construed
and
applied
by
the
commission
since
1940.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
it
would
benefit
the
holders
but
it
would
benefit
people
who
are
not
yet
holders.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
we
would
not
argue
that
the
commission
ought
not
to
take
competitive
factors
into
it,
into
consideration.
what
we're
saying
is
that
this
is
a
view
of
22
(f)
which
is
novel.
it
has
not
been
the
way
the
act
has
been
--
the
section
has
been
applied.
so
that
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
had
all
of
these
agreements
filed
with
it
if
it
--
that
is
the
fact
and
has
taken
no
action
is
of
no
significance
because
the
commission
has
not
been
giving
them
any
kind
of
scrutiny
that
is
relevant.
they
have
not
been
applying
that
standard
in
the
past
but
let
me
--
let
me
just
address
22
(f)
in
terms
of
its
legislative
history.
the
defendants
would
have
--they
argue
that
22
(f)
gave
general
validity
to
any
restrictions
in
registration
statements
imposed
by
the
fund
that
were
not
contrary
to
some
explicit
commission
rule
that
there
is
absolutely
no
support
for
that
reading
of
22
(f)
in
the
legislative
history.
22
(f)
was
intended
to
restrict
the
ability
of
funds
to
impose
such
restrictions
by
requiring
that
they
be
disclosed
so
that
investors
know
that
if
they
buy
a
mutual
fund,
there
maybe
some
limitation
on
its
transferability.
the
funds
involved
in
this
case
do
not
have
limitations
on
their
transferability.
they're
fully
transferable
and
in
the
same
manner
as
any
other
security.
the
restrictions
here
go
to
the
distribution
system
not
to
the
transferability
or
negotiability
of
the
fund.
those
are
technical
terms
used
in
a
technical
statute
and
is
simply
no
basis
for
thinking
that
congress
would
have
used
them
to
encompass
a
variety
of
contractual
limitations
of
which
it
had
noticed
and
still
used
the
narrow
language
but
anyway
the
22
(f)
stemmed
from
the
commission's
intent
to
restrict
the
activities
of
the
funds.
it
was
not
imposed
or
suggested
by
the
funds
as
a
means
of
enabling
them
to
deal
with
the
secondary
market.
indeed
in
the
legislative
history,
they
opposed
22
(f),
they
now
see
it
as
their
salvation
but
they
didn't
want
it
and
it
was
adopted
only
as
a
result
of
the
compromise
between
the
commission
and
the
funds
that
led
to
final
act.
our
position
and
we
think
it
is
the
only
way
that
22
(f)
can
be
read
consistently
with
this
court's
approach
to
questions
of
implied
repeal
is
that
22
(f)
particularly
where
the
commission
has
taken
no
action
has
no
effect
on
the
validity
of
restrictions
that
are
within
its
terms
under
other
federal
of
state
laws.
if
they
were
unlawful
under
some
federal
of
state
law
prior
to
1940,
they
would
be
unlawful
after
1940,
if
they
were
not
unlawful
then
no
effect,
it
left
them
where
they
stood.
all
it
did
was
impose
additional
requirements.
requirement
of
disclosure
in
the
registrations
statement
and
the
requirement
that
they
comply
with
any
additional
rules
that
the
commission
might
adopt,
of
course
the
commission
has
never
adopted
any
such
rules.
let
me
just
–
while
we're
on
22
(f),
the
idea
that
the
filing
of
a
contract
as
an
exhibit
to
a
registration
statement
is
the
same
as
inclusion
of
it
in
the
registration
statement
is
also
unfounded
here.
the
registration
statement
is
intended
with
the
prospectus
that
incorporates
most
of
it
to
inform
investors.
the
exhibits
and
all
of
the
technical
matters
that
are
filed
with
the
commission
don't
all
get
sent
out
to
the
investors
so
that
an
investor
might
well
buy
a
mutual
fund
on
the
basis
of
a
prospective
saying
his
shares
are
fully
transferable
and
then
find
that
there
are
contractual
restrictions
on
who
he
can
buy
and
sell
to.
so
not
only
does
22
(f)
not
validate
any
limitations,
the
type
of
restrictions
here
contained
in
the
contracts
are
simply
not
within
its
terms.
now
let
me
return
to
22
(d).
the
defendants
say
the
22
(d)
intended
to
impose
resale
price
maintenance
on
all
transactions.
again,
there
is
not
and
to
restrict
the
competition
of
the
secondary
market,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
supports
that
purpose,
22
(d)
was
first
proposed
by
the
industry
as
a
means
of
dealing
with
insider
trading.
no
reference
to
secondary
market
transactions.
it
was
then
incorporated
in
a
compromised
measure
that
resulted
in
the
revised
bill
that
was
then
enacted
without
change.
again,
no
reference
to
secondary
market.
there
is
not
a
reference
to
secondary
markets
and
now
the
committee
reports
are
in
the
debates.
there
is
simply
not
a
word
in
the
pertinent
legislative
history
that
supports
the
defendant's
attribution
of
purpose.
now
we
say
that
the
language
of
this
22
(d)
is
perfectly
clear.
it
does
not
applied
to
inter-dealer
transactions,
that
does
not
to
apply
to
brokerage
transactions.
on
this,
the
commission
agrees
with
us
and
has
explicitly
taken
the
position
in
its
amicus
brief
here
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
to
the
extent
that
it
read
22
(d)
as
requiring
resale
price
maintenance
in
all
such
transactions.
that
has
been
the
commission's
consistent
view
and
first
announced
contemporaneous
with
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
it's
entitled
of
course
to
the
weight
--
the
great
weight
that
such
interpretations
normally
receive.
now,
in
mentioning
the
commission's
interpretation
and
its
reiteration
of
that
interpretation
in
this
brief,
i
think
it
fairly
shows
that
the
defendant's
argument
based
on
certain
legislative
history
concerning
the
1970
amendments
to
the
investment
company
act
in
which
22
(d)
was
reenacted
without
any
material
changed
and
certain
prior
legislative
proposals
that
were
not
enacted
simply
is
of
no
relevance
to
the
question
of
what
22
(d)
means.
the
commission's
interpretation
has
been
consistent
and
has
been
unaffected
and
the
statements
that
the
other
side
has
relied
upon
in
that
legislative
history,
we
have
addressed
in
our
reply
brief
simply
did
not
deal
with
the
precise
questions
before
the
court
in
this
case.
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
defendants
make
in
trying
to
say
that
22
(d)
ought
not
be
construed
to
permit
a
brokerage
market
to
flourish
is
that
such
a
market
would
be
impractical
but
the
major
premise
is
obviously
unacceptable
because
legality
is
not
governed
by
practicability.
but
even
the
question
of
practicability,
we
cannot
accept
the
defendant's
premise.
if
such
a
market
were
so
impractical
then
why
do
they
go
to
such
elaborate
lengths
to
preclude
it
through
contractual
agreements?
if
it's
so
impractical,
why
has
the
commission
undertaken
in
a
1974
report
which
the
parties
have
made
great
reference
to
permit
such
a
market
to
develop.
there
was
simply
no
basis
for
saying
that
this
market
cannot
exist
under
22
(d)
because
it
would
be
impractical.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
am
not
in
the
position
to
say.
let
me
return
to
the
commission's
role
under
22
(f)
because
that
has
a
bearing
on
the
question
of
immunity.
as
i've
indicated
the
commission
for
35
years
has
not
been
playing
an
active
role
in
reviewing
this
agreements
that
are
filed
with
it
under
22
(f)
and
certainly
has
not
been
reviewing
them
with
antitrust
or
competitive
principles
in
mind,
that
in
itself
and
the
fact
that
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
commission
to
consider
competitive
consequences,
removes
one
of
the
essential
conditions
for
a
finding
of
a
broad
implied
immunity.
as
i
said
this
court
to
my
knowledge
has
never
found
such
an
immunity
to
exist
where
the
agency
did
not
have
an
obligation
to
review
matters
with
some
kind
of
competitive
considerations
as
part
of
the
mix
of
its
regulatory
factors.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
there
was
i
think
until
the
early
60's,
it
was
less
clear
to
everyone
that
these
securities
transactions
were
fully
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
practices
were
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
there
was
the
silver
case
for
one
and
it
was
also
and
with
the
particular
reference
to
the
securities
industry
of
1963
or
so,
a
study
which
revealed
a
lot
of
the
competitive
problems
of
the
industry.
it
is
basically
said
in
motion
a
lot
of
thinking
in
consideration
of
these
problems.
in
addition
as
to
the
brokerage
market
for
example,
i
mentioned
it
as
a
practical
matter,
it
may
have
required
computer
development
before
it
became
as
feasible
as
it
might
be
now.
of
course,
we
are
seeking
here
injunctive
relief
only.
a
further
problem
with
the
immunity
argument
of
the
other
side
is
that
there
is
really
no
commission
proceeding
in
which
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
the
conduct
that
is
challenged
in
this
case
could
be
considered
and
it
gets
highly
significant
that
the
commission
itself
while
it
supports
the
defendants
as
to
counts
ii
through
viii
and
says
that
under
its
present
reading
of
22
(f),
all
of
those
agreements
come
within
its
jurisdiction,
it
does
not
support
them
as
to
count
i.
it
makes
no
claim
that
the
allegations
of
count
i
or
within
its
jurisdiction
and
makes
no
claim
that
those
allegations
are
covered
by
some
kind
of
anti
trust
immunity
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well
i
think
it's
hard
to
give
a
precise
answer
to
that
because
count
i
is
a
broad
horizontal
type
of
combination
which
has
as
its
focus
the
--
among
other
things,
the
development
of
these
vertical
arrangements
which
are
challenged
in
counts
ii
through
viii,
so
they
are
somewhat
interrelated.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
count
i
referred
to
other
matters
such
as
discouraging
people
who
--
a
number
of
things
to
suppress
the
development
of
the
secondary
market
in
addition
to
contract
such
as
discouraging
people
who
might
be
interested
in
engaging
in
such
a
market
by
saying
and
suggesting
that
it
was
not
lawful
or
a
distributing
information
that
mischaracterized
the
legality
of
such
transactions
and
sort
of
supplemental
to
the
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
but
one
problem
on
--
in
answering
on
count
i
is
that
we're
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
we
don't
have
the
facts
but
there
are
some
indications
in
the
record
that
are
suggestive.
government
exhibit
13
which
is
an
interoffice
memorandum
from
the
crosby
corporation
in
1970,
refers
to
the
problem
of
dealers
buying
from
the
investors
and
selling
again
not
redeeming
and
addresses
the
question
whether
such
--
the
dealer
agreements
should
be
amended
to
preclude
those
transactions
and
indicates
awareness
that
to
do
so
would
raise
serious
questions
under
the
antitrust
laws.
there
is
knowledge
that
going
beyond
the
bounds
of
22
(d)
presents
serious
antitrust
questions
so
that
it's
not
as
if
they
were
babes
in
the
woods.
another
exhibit,
government
exhibit
12,
13
is
at
page
267
of
the
appendix,
12
the
last
page
at
266
which
is
another
interoffice
memorandum
in
1950,
it
talks
about
the
importance
of
eliminating
the
competitive
business
and
knitting
together
in
a
coordinated
campaign
to
cut
down
on
competitive
street
markets.
we
don't
know
what
else
there
maybe
behind
the
face
of
the
complaint.
we
haven't
had
discovery
yet.
so
i
just
can't
give
you
a
definitive
answer
but
the
activities
challenged
in
count
i
supplement
and
reinforce
and
give
broader
effect
to
the
agreements
challenged
in
counts
ii
through
viii.
now
the
test
of
course,
under
silver
on
the
question
of
immunity
is
whether
immunity
as
to
a
particular
challenged
transactions
is
necessary
to
make
the
regulatory
act
work
and
even
then
immunity
is
implied
only
to
the
minimum
extent
necessary
to
do
so
and
there
has
been
no
showing
here
that
the
kind
of
sweeping
immunity
for
all
kinds
of
restraints
on
secondary
markets
that
are
comprehended
by
the
complaint
satisfy
either
of
the
silver
tests.
i
was
beginning
to
say
earlier,
the
commission
simply
has
no
appropriate
authority
to
review
the
kinds
of
activities
that
are
challenged
in
the
complaint.
22
(d)
provides
it
with
no
jurisdiction,
it
has
no
function
under
22
(d)
except
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
no
obviously
if
the
statute
requires
someone
to
sell
at
a
price
fixed
by
his
supplier
we
would
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well
there's
no
question
you
can
sell
that
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right,
imposed
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
precisely
right.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right
and
of
course
if
the
fund
suspends
offering
and
some
do
from
time
to
time
then
the
whole
resale
price
maintenance
is
out
and
let
me
point
out
the
agreements
here
don't
limit
their
provisions
to
times
when
the
fund
is
continuously
offering.
that
maybe
the
norm
but
that
is
not
the
condition
set
forth
in
the
agreements.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well
they
generally
do.
there's
no
question
about
that
but
they
are
not
obliged
to.
they
are
obliged
by
law
to
redeem
at
anytime.
they're
not
obliged
by
law
to
continuously
offer
and
some
have
been
closed
up
for
decades.

not
necessarily.
no,
they
have
good
results,
they
may
just
have
their
shares
traded
in
a
secondary
market.
if
they're
doing
well
people
will
trade
there
rather
than
redeem.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
they
have
authority
to
regulate
that
in
the
primary
distribution
system.
it
is
tied
with
the
resale,
same
scope
as
the
resale
price
maintenance.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well
at
present,
an
investor
has
to
pay
the
load
whether
or
not
the
dealer
performs
any
services
that
sales
load
and
mutual
funds
reflects
a
large
selling
expense.
but
if
you'd
already
bought
fund,
you
know
about
mutual
funds
and
you
don't
need
to
be
sold
on
them.
all
you
need
is
the
mechanics
to
be
taken
care
of
why
should
you
have
to
pay
a
full
sales
load
when
if
you
could
go
to
a
broker,
you
could
buy
this
shares
that
someone
else
down
the
street
is
trying
to
sell.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
8
1/2
%,
it's
sizable.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right.
it's
not
just
the
load,
it's
the
freedom
of
options
which
is
very
basic
in
the
competitive
system.
and
the
final
consideration
on
the
question
of
immunity
is
that
it's
essential
there
be
some
conflict.
now
there
is
no
conflict
here,
there
is
certainly
no
conflict
with
anything
the
commission
has
done
in
the
past.
as
to
the
future,
the
purpose
of
this
suit
is
consistent
with
the
commission's
proposals
in
its
1974
report.
they
want
to
end
these
contractual
limitations
too.
so
there's
no
conflict
there,
there's
no
conflict
either
with
the
commission's
proposals
to
permit
funds
to
impose
transfer
fees
and
other
measures.
they're
just
not
in
conflict.
now
going
beyond
that,
the
defendants
suggest
well,
there
maybe
some
possibility
of
conflict
between
something
that
the
court
here
might
require
and
something
that
the
commission
might
require
someday.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right,
but
it's
net
asset
value
with
the
date
of
receipt
by
the
fund
if
he
wants
to
get
cash
quickly
and
at
more
certain
price,
he
may
want
to
redeem
on
the
secondary
market.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
it
depends.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
he
sells
to
a
dealer,
he
would
pay
whatever
the
market
price
was.
if
he
sold
through
a
broker
there
would
be
a
small
commission
but
as
to
this
remote
possibility
of
some
future
conflict
of
course
the
court
held
in
silver
and
in
gulf
states,
(inaudible)
rather
that
that
is
not
sufficient.
you
need
an
actual
conflict.
in
addition,
we
don't
have
a
judgment
here.
the
judgment
if
and
when
it
is
entered
could
take
into
account
the
possibility
that
the
commission
might
act
differently
in
the
future
and
it
could
accommodate
the
possibility
of
some
overlap
of
jurisdiction.
so
we
believe
that
none
of
the
conditions
of
implied
immunity
is
satisfied
here
and
that
the
defendant's
restraints
are
not
justified
and
certainly
not
required
by
22
(d)
or
22
(f)
that
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
should
be
reversed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
would
appear
to
be
the
situation.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i'd
like
to
address
one
comment
by
mr.
loevinger.
he
said
that
these
contracts
have
been
in
existence
before
and
after
the
investment
company
act
that
the
only
thing
that
happened
was
the
enactment
of
that
act.
well,
it
is
true
that
investment
companies
study
show
that
there
were
some
such
contractual
restrictions
in
existence
prior
to
1940
did
not
indicate
that
they
had
become
widespread
and
virtually
the
norm
the
way
they
are
now.
this
is
indeed
part
of
count
1.
count
1
says
that
they
have
combined
to
restrain
the
development
of
secondary
markets
and
one
of
the
ways
in
which
they
have
done
it
is
to
induce
funds
and
underwriters
to
include
these
restrictive
provisions
in
their
vertical
agreements.
so
that
--
we
don't
have
a
record
first
of
all
on
what
existed
prior
to
1940
but
it
is
inaccurate
to
suggest
that
there
is
nothing
since
then
that
is
important.
we
certainly
do
not
withdraw.
we
have
not
withdrawn
or
abandoned
count
1
in
any
way.
what
we
have
done
is
qualified
one
single
allegation
of
count
1
which
could've
been
read
as
challenging
rules
adopted
by
the
nasd.
it
made
it
clear
that
that
is
not
part
of
count
1.
the
balance
of
count
1
which
is
on
page
9
of
the
appendix
stands
fully
in
effect.
now,
with
respect
to
22
(f),
commission
had
conceded
that
they
have
done
nothing
under
22
(f)
as
we
have
indicated.
but
they
also
indicated
that
they
thought
that
they
could
act
with
reference
to
not
only
protection
of
outstanding
shareholders
but
protection
of
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
nasd
rules,
no.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
the
contracts,
yes.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that's
right.
and
the
complaint
is
not
limited
to
brokerage
markets
involving
contract
dealers.
count
1
is
unqualified.
now,
22
(f)
does
not,
as
mr.
north
indicated
refer
in
terms,
the
protection
of
the
investment
--
investing
public
who
are
not
already
shareholders.
now,
another
provision
that
should
be
borne
in
mind
in
considering
22
(f)
is
section
50
of
the
act
which
provides
that
nothing
in
the
act
affects
the
jurisdiction
of
any
agency
or
officer
of
the
united
states
or
any
state
with
respect
to
any
person,
security
or
transaction
except
in
the
possible
extent
of
any
conflict
with
something
in
the
act.
now,
there
is
no
conflict
with
anything
in
an
antitrust
suit
and
22
(f)
standing
alone.
so,
we
have
the
statute
supporting
us
in
that
regard.
i
should
suppose
also
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
restrictive
--
that
a
registration
statement
discloses
a
merger
for
example
that
would
plainly
violate
the
antitrust
laws
would
not
mean
that
that
merger
is
immune.
i
mean
that
is
contrary
to
do
--
the
facts
of
life
in
the
way
this
court
has
applied
the
antitrust
laws
for
years.
so
if
a
restriction
on
transferability
precluded
the
sale
to
a
black
person,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
federal
civil
rights
laws
and
maybe
unlikely
but
with
current
activities
in
the
investment
world,
various
things
may
seem
more
likely
than
we
would
like.
that
would
not
be
exempted
from
the
civil
rights
act
just
because
it
was
disclosed
in
the
registration
statement.
the
commission's
require
that
this
is
sent
to
shareholders
indicate
that
the
fact
that
the
document
has
been
reviewed
by
the
commission
does
not
constitute
approval
of
it
and
is
not
any
guarantee
of
the
adequacy
or
the
accuracy
of
any
representations
therein.
as
an
example
of
that,
in
government
exhibit
8
on
page
254,
the
standard
legend
which
belies
any
notion
of
the
commission's
function
in
reviewing
these
statements
is
an
approval
function.
thank
you.
