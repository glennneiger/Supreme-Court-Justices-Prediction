mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
it
the
court.
in
the
first
of
the
great
antitrust
cases
in
the
securities
industry,
judge
mcdine
(ph)
back
in
1953
observed
the
initial
inquiry
and
the
antitrust
case
must
be
in
to
the
character
and
background
of
the
industry
involved.
now,
mr.
norton
has
sketched
very
nicely
the
character
and
the
operation
of
mutual
funds,
of
the
few
points
i
may
take
exception
too,
however
he
has
not
undertaken
to
examine
the
character
of
the
securities
industry.
well,
all
there's
a
limited
record
here.
fortunately
all
of
the
facts
of
significance
on
matters
of
public
record.
in
1963
there
was
a
special
study
of
the
securities
market
which
has
been
referred
to
by
this
court
cited
in
silver
and
cartwright
and
another
cases
and
therefore
i
have
had
reference
to
that
as
a
source
of
available
information.
and
my
information
concerning
the
markets
comes
from
that.
there
are
two
basic
types
or
markets.
first,
the
initial
issue
of
market
for
distribution
of
securities
in
the
public
hands
which
is
usually
in
handled
through
underwriters
and
second,
trading
markets
for
continuous
trading
and
outstanding
securities.
the
special
study
says
the
uses
and
mechanisms
of
trading
markets
are
substantially
different
from
those
of
distribution
markets.
the
term
primary
is
sometimes
used
to
refer
to
the
original
issue
market
and
the
term
secondary
to
the
secondary
trading
markets
and
the
terms
are
so
used
in
this
case.
there
are
however
two
types
of
trading
markets
exchanges
and
over
the
counter
markets.
the
special
study
says
that
these
are
fundamentally
similar
in
purpose
and
function
but
substantially
dissimilar
in
mechanics
and
practices.
in
the
exchange
markets,
there
is
a
physical
congregation
of
buyers
and
sellers
represented
by
brokers
on
the
floor
of
the
exchangers
and
actually
at
physical
locations
within
the
exchanges.
there
is
continuous
auction
trading
with
buying
and
selling
and
the
price
fluctuating
according
to
supply
and
demand.
trades
are
executed
quickly
often
and
within
minutes
of
the
time
the
order
is
given.
the
market
could
function
solely
as
a
nexus
for
matching
public
orders
to
buy
and
sell
although
there
are
dealers
on
the
market
they
handle
odd
lots
and
perform
various
other
functions.
the
over
the
counter
markets
in
contrast
have
no
physical
place
of
congregation.
the
special
study
says
that
such
markets
exists
only
as
and
to
the
extent
that
dealers
elect
to
make
them
by
standing
ready
to
buy
and
sell
for
their
own
accounts.
these
dealers
are
market
makers
and
in
the
over
the
counter
markets,
there
is
no
mechanism
for
matching
public
orders
so
that
the
market
makers
are
the
over
the
counter
equivalent
of
the
nexus
between
buyers
and
sellers
provided
by
the
exchange
floor.
there
is
also
something
called
the
third
market
which
consists
of
stocks
listed
on
any
exchange
brought
or
sold
over
the
counter.
this
exists
almost
exclusively
to
serve
the
needs
of
very
large
institutional
investors
often
trading
tens
of
thousands
of
shares
worth
millions
of
dollars
and
occasionally
these
are
brokered
transactions
because
there's
enough
involved
so
if
they
can
go
off
and
look
for
buyers
or
sellers
to
match
the
orders.
there
is
also
been
some
discussion
recently
of
a
so-called
electronic
market
resulting
as
mr.
norton
have
said
from
recent
developments
of
computer
technology
and
electronic
communication
and
it
has
made
theoretically
possible,
the
combination
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
the
regional
subsidiary
exchanges
and
possibly
even
of
over
the
counter
markets.
whatever
the
merits
or
demerits
of
the
so-called
electronic
mark,
if
they
lie
wholly
in
the
future
and
are
entirely
theoretical,
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case
because
they
never
have
existed,
are
not
yet
in
existence.
now,
as
mr.
norton
had
said,
there
are
various
types
of
mutual
funds
or
open-ended
management
investment
companies.
however,
this
case
is
concerned
with
only
one
type,
open-end
management
investment
companies
engaged
in
continuous
sale
of
their
shares.
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
so-called
closed-end
or
with
the
closed-up
funds.
mr.
norton
said
that
there
maybe
occasions
when
an
open-end
company
is
closed
up,
that
may
very
well
be
but
on
those
occasions
the
sales
agreements
to
which
he
objects
are
no
longer
in
effect.
so
those
are
completely
out
of
the
case.
in
any
event,
all
of
the
defendants
here
are
open-end
funds
that
have
never
been
closed
up
and
so
we
are
not
concerned
with
any
closed
up
funds.
mutual
funds
have
been
well
analyzed
and
described
in
both
of
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinions
in
the
united
states
versus
cartwright
so
that
this
court
is
presumably
familiar
with
them
as
a
means
of
providing
a
diversified
investment
portfolio
and
management
service,
mainly
for
small
individuals
and
institutional
investors.
they
have
as
was
said
the
unique
characteristics
of
being
continuously
offered
through
underwritings
and
primary
distribution
and
of
being
required
to
buy
back
any
outstanding
shares
at
any
time
of
the
net
asset
value.
thus,
the
price
of
funds
is
not
set
as
are
the
price
of
almost
all
other
securities
by
supply
and
demand.
in
the
first
place,
the
supply
is
practically
unlimited
so
there
would
be
no
limitation
on
that
side
of
the
equation.
in
the
second
place,
the
price
depends
upon
the
net
asset
value
which
is
based
on
the
market
value
of
the
underlying
portfolio
securities.
this
is
simply
determined
mathematically
by
a
clerk
in
the
office.
there
is
no
management
discretion
involved.
that's
a
pure
mathematical
computation.
furthermore,
although
the
government
talks
about
a
restriction
or
restraint
of
competition
here,
there
is
vigorous
competition
between
funds
based
on
performance,
portfolio,
selection
of
type
and
nature
of
operation
and
various
other
characteristics.
there
is
vigorous
inter
fund
competition
and
there
is
no
contention
to
the
contrary
here.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir
they
do,
because
some
funds
have
higher
loads,
other
funds
have
no
load,
some
funds
have
no
loads.
there
is
competition
between
funds
as
to
load.
the
government
is
addressing
its
case
solely
to
the
fact
that
as
to
within
the
organization
of
a
single
problem,
the
dealers
engaged
in
the
distribution
of
a
single
fund
do
not
compete
as
the
load.
that's
the
whole
government
case
here.
now
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
indeed
they
are
not,
sir.
no,
sir.
they
vary
from
a
very
low
percentage
to
eight
and
a
half
percent.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
a
pending
nasd
rule
that
sets
a
maximum
of
eight-and-a-half
percent
with
things
scaled
down
according
to
various
contingencies.
this
has
been
given
tentative
approval
by
the
sec
an
will
into
effect
fairly
shortly
but
they
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes,
sir
but
no
load
funds
on
the
market
and
available.
mr.
lee
loevinger
now
there
are
open-end,
no
load
funds
on
the
markets.
mr.
lee
loevinger
right,
why
do
people
buy
load
funds
that's
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
that's
a
very
good
question,
mr.
justice
and
that
brings
me
to
the
next
point
which
is
that
mutual
funds
are
and
have
been
as
found
by
the
sec
dependent
upon
their
primary
distribution
system.
by
and
large,
the
demand
for
fund
shares
is
the
result
of
advertising
a
sales
promotion
efforts
by
the
under
writers
and
the
dealers.
furthermore,
for
funds
that
do
have
loads
and
are
thus
dependent
continuous
cash
flow
from
their
sales
is
necessary
to
provide
the
cash
for
redemption.
without
such
continuing
sales,
the
funds
would
be
forced
to
sell
our
portfolio
securities
in
order
to
meet
the
demands
for
redemptions.
this
would
tend
to
depress
the
markets
and
ultimately
make
the
funds
self
liquidating.
this
method
of
distribution
incidentally
is
rather
logical
for
mutual
funds
because
as
i've
mentioned,
trading
markets
exist
to
redistribute
outstanding
shares
previously
distributed
by
the
issuer.
for
most
securities,
this
is
as
mr.
norton
correctly
said
the
most
important
market.
however,
since
mutual
funds
are
continuously
being
issued
and
repurchased
by
the
issuer,
there
is
no
function
for
the
secondary
market
to
perform
at
all
analogous
to
the
secondary
market
trading
function
for
other
securities
and
as
noted
in
cartwright,
this
method
of
distribution
is
now
mandated
by
statute
and
under
the
statutory
scheme,
the
redemption
of
shares
by
funds
is
the
market
and
the
only
market
for
investors.
now,
before
1940
when
the
investment
company
act
was
passed,
there
was
a
secondary
dealer's
market
in
mutual
funds
by
non-contract
dealers
which
was
referred
to
as
the
bootleg
market.
non-contract
dealers
would
buy
from
stock
holders
at
slightly
below
the
net
asset
value
and
resell
to
investors
at
slightly
below
the
public
offering
price.
they
could
do
this
because
they
eliminated
the
underwriting
fee
which
at
that
time
was
substantially
higher
than
it
is
today.
there
never
has
been
prior
to
1940
or
since
then
a
secondary
brokerage
market
in
mutual
funds.
this
simply
has
been
nonexistent
for
two
compelling
reasons.
first,
it
has
been
functionally
impractical
because
there
was
simply
no
way
for
brokers
to
function
in
and
over
the
counter
market
except
on
very
large
transactions
where
the
brokerage
commission
would
enable
them
to
go
out
and
search
for
buyers
or
sellers.
incidentally,
it's
unethical
for
brokers
to
seek
to
get
fund
investors
to
sell
their
fund
shares
because
they
were
guarded
as
long-term
investments.
the
second
is
that
it's
been
economically
unprofitable
because
the
brokerage
commissions
have
always
been
less
than
the
dealer's
markups
on
mutual
funds.
now
in
1935,
congress
directed
an
extensive
study
of
investment
companies
and
after
four
years,
the
sec
submitted
its
investment
study
to
congress
as
a
result
of
which
congress
in
1940
enacted
the
investment
company
act.
the
congressional
intent
contrary
to
the
representations
of
the
government
clearly
was
to
restrain
and
inhibit
the
growth
of
a
secondary
trading
market
in
mutual
fund
shares
in
order
to
maintain
the
primary
distribution
system
and
protect
it
against
disruption.
mr.
norton
has
suggested
that
there
is
no
testimony
to
this
effect.
i
suggest
the
testimony
of
mr.
skinker(ph)
the
director
of
the
investment
trust
study
which
can
be
found
in
the
dealer's
brief
which
is
the
big
red
one
at
page
31,
specifically
mentions
the
bootleg
market.
this
was
mentioned
in
the
investment
trust
study
and
there
is
as
we
demonstrate
at
considerable
length
in
our
brief.
a
legislative
background
showing
that
in
fact
the
suppression
of
the
bootleg
market
was
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
lee
loevinger
that
has
been
implemented
by
the
sec.
it
was
implemented
in
1969,
mr.
justice
by
an
sec
rule
requiring
forward
pricing
which
is
now
the
present
practice.
therefore,
the
problem
of
dilution
resulting
from
forward
pricing
has
been
totally
eliminated
and
when
congress
reenacted
section
22
(d)
in
1970,
it
had
no
such
problem
before
it
which
again
reinforces
the
same
conclusion.
in
any
event
in
an
investment
company
act,
there
was
--
there
were
ample
provisions
for
the
regulation
of
mutual
fund
sales
and
distribution.
22
(a)
referred
to
the
method
of
pricing,
gave
the
nasd
and
the
sec
a
power
to
pass
such
rules,
22
(b)
gave
the
nasd
and
the
sec
power
to
regulate
mutual
fund
loads,
22
(d)
provided
the
mutual
fund
share
should
be
sold
to
investors
only
at
a
current
public
offering
price
which
in
effect
protected
the
sales,
load
or
sales
margin
against
the
price
cutting
of
a
secondary
market
and
22
(f)
authorized
restrictions
on
transferability
and
negotiability
of
fund
shares
which
were
fully
disclosed
to
the
sec
and
not
disapproved.
the
sec
says
in
its
brief
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
regulate
through
section
22
(f),
restrictions
on
secondary
market
activities
in
mutual
fund
shares
and
we
fully
agree
with
that
position.
mr.
lee
loevinger
they
eliminated
the
secondary
market,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lee
loevinger
as
a
practical
matter,
yes.
they
did
eliminate
the
secondary
market.
incidentally,
the
sec
has
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
or
that
the
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
we
needn't
rest
on
that
sir
that
the
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
as
a
practical
matter,
the
powers
of
the
sec
under
22
(f)
are
perfectly
adequate
to
this
case
to
answer
the
question
asked
by
mr.
justice
powell
as
a
practical
matter
all
of
the
restrictions
the
government
has
complaining
about
are
in
fact
contained
in
the
agreements
and
if
the
sec
made
regulations
under
22
(f),
that
would
as
a
practical
matter
end
the
case.
however,
there
is
ample
authority
under
other
sections.
under
22
(b),
there
is
an
expressed
antitrust
exemption
for
control
of
sales
loads
by
the
sec
and
by
the
nasd,
22
(d)
sets
the
price
however
section
6
(c)
of
the
investment
company
act
gives
the
sec
full
exemptive
power
as
the
department
of
justice
has
often
urged
before
the
sec
so
that
the
sec
in
section
38
gives
the
sec
power
to
promulgate
any
rules
and
regulations
of
likes
to
implement
of
the
other
sections
of
the
act.
so
the
sec
has
plenary
power
to
control
all
of
the
matters
that
are
in
discussion
here.
furthermore,
the
history
actually
--
(voice
overlap)
yes,
it
has
sir
to
a
large
extent.
in
the
1974
report
as
the
sec
points
out,
all
of
these
matters
are
discussed.
there
are
proposals
relating
to
every
single
thing
that
government
has
under
discussion
and
there
are
--
some
of
them
have
been
some
of
them
are
in
the
forms
of
tentative
rules,
others
in
the
form
of
recommendations
for
no
action
but
they
have
all
been
thoroughly
discussed,
considered
and
are
the
subject
of
either
past
or
pending
actions
by
the
sec.
i
submit
mr.,
justice
that
history
has
in
fact
answered
your
question
as
to
the
effect
of
22-d
and
22-f.
there
was
a
very
active
secondary
dealer
market
up
to
the
time
of
passage
of
the
investment
company
act
in
1940.
it
has
been
estimated,
it
was
approximately
as
large
perhaps,
it
tried
for
larger
than
the
primary
distribution
market.
since
1940,
the
secondary
market
has
disappeared
except
for
what
the
sec
refers
to
as
miniscule
market
and
which
all
the
parties
agree
amount
to
less
than
1/10
to
one
percent
of
the
total
market
and
that
has
been
entirely
the
result
of
the
passage
of
the
investment
company
act.
mr.
lee
loevinger
those
existed
prior
to
1940,
mr.
justice.
if
it
hadn't,
the
only
thing
that
changed
in
1940
was
the
passage
of
the
investment
company
act.
consequently
it's
the
only
thing
to
which
we
can
attribute
the
disappearance
of
the
secondary
market.
furthermore,
the
protest
from
the
secondary
market
dealers
which
are
in
the
record
largely
as
government
exhibits
show
that
in
fact
these
were
--
that
this
was
what
the
secondary
market
dealers
saw
as
driving
them
out
of
business.
the
reason
for
this
is
fairly
simple
you
see,
because
as
i
explained
you
have
to
understand
the
mechanism
of
the
market.
in
the
secondary
market,
secondary
trading
markets,
there
are
enough
brokers
for
transactions
of
this
kind.
there
are
only
dealers.
the
government
admits,
both
in
its
main
and
its
reply
brief
as
i
recall,
page
two
of
the
reply
brief
that
section
22
(d)
applies
to
all
sales
by
all
dealers
regardless
of
the
capacity
in
which
they
are
acting
are
the
market,
in
which
they
are
acting.
since
secondary
market
dealers
can
not
offer
an
investor
any
advantage
in
selling
price,
there
is
simply
no
function
for
the
secondary
market
anymore.
therefore,
the
investment
company
act
wiped
out
the
secondary
market
in
1940
and
it
exists
as
a
minuscule
thing
or
a
curiosity,
i
assume
largely
is
a
matter
of
convenience
among
dealers
and
for
other
peripheral
things
but
obviously
not
of
any
real
importance.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
the
--
i'm
sorry
if
the
dealer
wants
to
sell,
yes
sir.
the
dealer
must
sell
at
the
public
offering
price.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes,
sir.
that's
conceded
by
the
government,
no
question
about
that.
mr.
lee
loevinger
obviously
proper,
there's
no
law
against
it,
no
rule
against
it,
no
restriction
against
it,
it's
not
involved
in
the
case.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
is
some
question
as
to
whether
or
not
22d
reaches
the
case
of
a
broker
who
is
not
in
fact
a
dealer
and
acts
only
as
a
broker
between
two
investors
but
again
that's
a
pure
abstraction.
it's
the
most
exceptional
case,
it's
something
the
only
case
that
has
ever
come
to
light
at
that
time
is
the
oxford
case
which
involves
most
extraordinary
circumstances
perfectly
obviously
redolent
of
fraud
and
overreaching
on
the
part
of
a
small
firm
that
had
two
customers
and
substantially
only
two
customers
and
it
sold
fund
shares
for
one
at
the
same
time.
it
bought
the
same
fund
shares
for
the
other
and
attempted
to
charge
the
full
spread
and
the
sec
said
“you
couldn't
get
away
with
it,”
but
there
is
nothing
in
there
to
indicate
that
it
ever
acted
as
a
dealer.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there's
no
charge
that
they
have
done
this.
the
only
charge
is
that
the
contract
dealers
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
think
it
would
be
sir
because
these
are
so
--
there
is
such
a
pervasive
system
of
regulation
by
the
sec.
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
any
practice
that
any
of
the
dealers
or
brokers
or
underwriters
can
engage
in
here
that
is
not
subject
to
sec
control.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
is
a
formal
allegation
to
this
effect
but
in
fact
it
has
been
largely
abandoned.
this
formal
allegation
rests
upon
the
assertion
that
nasd
rules
have
this
effect
but
they
have
now
retreated
from
that
allegation
and
thereby
substantially
withdrawn
their
count
i
charges.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
government's
exhibits
12
and
13
that
mr.
norton
referred
to
are
concerned
exclusively
with
vertical
restrictions
and
not
the
horizontal
restrictions.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
believe
that
is
precisely
the
incidence,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
know
he
didn't
but
in
fact
they
have
because
all
of
the
substantial
allegations
have
been
abandoned.
mr.
lee
loevinger
the
government
is
very
anxious
to
have
the
case
reversed
and
to
prevail
sir,
but
there
is
nothing
left
of
count
i
after
they
have
abandoned
the
charge,
the
nasd
rules
violate
the
antitrust
laws.
the
count
i
doesn't
stand
in
the
record,
simply
on
its
fair
--
in
the
first
place,
the
things
that
they
are
talking
about
here
and
in
their
brief
which
referred
to
the
refusal
of
broker
dealers
to
sell
to
a
secondary
market
dealers
don't
appear
in
count
i
as
it
--
of
the
complaint
as
it
was
drafted
file
and
appears
in
the
record.
count
i
refers
primarily
to
nasd
rules
when
those
have
been
abandoned,
we
are
left
to
look
to
this
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
its
concession
that
the
nasd
rules
are
not
under
attack.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
that's
--
there
is
a
letter
from
counsel
and
the
joint
appendix
at
page
327.
it
set
forth
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
on
page
26.
it's
repeated
in
the
government
brief
at
page
51
and
mr.
norton
made
the
admission
in
oral
argument
here.
there
is
no
attack
upon
nasd
rules,
that's
perfectly
clear
at
this
point.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir.
these
are
the
agreements
that
are
attacking
constitutional
way.
now,
actually
the
existence
of
agreements
is
required
by
rule
26
of
the
nasd
which
is
of
course
not
under
attack
and
the
restrictions
on
the
sales
fund,
on
the
fund
sales
are
we
maintain
plainly
authorized
by
section
22
(f)
so
that
indeed
it
does
come
down
to
the
question
of
what
is
this
case
all
about
and
let
me
quote
from
the
government
brief
to
suggest
what
the
case
maybe
about.
the
government
brief
says
at
page
9,
that
the
secondary
dealer
market
does
not
ordinarily
produce
any
monetary
advantage
to
a
buying
investor.
furthermore,
if
this
leads
to
the
conclusion
on
government
brief
at
page
34,
that
the
prices
in
a
competitive
secondary
market
are
not
likely
to
differ
substantially
from
the
price
established
in
a
primary
distribution
chain.
consequently,
one
is
really
entitled
to
ask
why
has
the
government
brought
and
why
does
it
pursue
this
case
and
we
believe
that
it
is
because
it
is
dissatisfied
with
its
efforts
to
get
the
sec
to
act
immediately
to
exempt
or
abolish
section
22
(d)
and
to
get
congress
to
repeal
22
(d).
there
were
three
exhaustive
studies
presented
to
congress
in
1962,
1963,
and
1966
on
the
securities
markets.
there
was
four
years
of
hearing
from
1967
through
1970.
the
department
of
justice
contended
that
22
(d)
should
be
repealed.
the
sec
said,
no,
don't
repeal
22
(d)
but
impose
a
flat
statutory
maximum
of
5%
on
sales
loads.
congress
rejected
both
proposals
and
in
a
legislative
--
with
a
legislative
history
that
is
perfectly
clear
that
they
were
talking
about
the
protections
of
primary
distribution
system
against
any
secondary
trading
markets.
they
reenacted
section
22
(d)
in
full
in
1970
with
the
full
knowledge
that
since
1940
to
1970,
the
action
of
22
(d)
and
the
investment
company
act
had
in
fact
eliminated
the
secondary
markets.
this
was
fully
explained,
it
was
fully
explored,
there
are
numerous
statements
by
senators
representatives
and
witnesses
in
the
--
before
the
congress
during
the
period,
1967
to
1970
so
that
we
must
look
to
the
1970
enactment
of
section
22
(d)
to
see
that
congress
was
fully
aware
that
in
enacting
section
22
(d)
and
the
other
provisions
of
the
investment
company
act
which
were
fully
reexamined,
it
knew
it
was
eliminating
the
secondary
trading
markets.
furthermore,
i
think
that
if
the
court
will
look
at
all
of
the
provisions
of
this
extremely
complicated
and
complex
statute
coupled
with
the
provisions
of
the
maloney
act,
it
will
see
that
regardless
of
the
technical
construction
that
maybe
put
on
the
specific
terms
of
particular
sections
that
there
can
be
no
real
quarrel
with
what
the
sec
states
as
the
basis
of
its
interest
in
this
case
and
in
its
brief
at
19
where
it
says,
the
investment
company
act
of
1940
vests
in
the
commission
pervasive
authority
to
regulate
the
process
of
distributing
mutual
fund
shares
and
then
roll
a
retail
price
maintenance
therein.
furthermore,
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
government
has
sought
to
file
its
brief
in
gordon
in
this
case
as
further
elucidation
or
part
of
its
position
and
in
the
government's
brief,
as
amicus
in
gordon
it
says
at
page
35,
it
attempts
to
distinguish
this
case
from
the
case
of
the
exchange
and
it
says
in
the
maloney
act,
congress
expressly
incorporated
antitrust
principles
and
made
that
the
duty
of
the
sec
to
enforce
them
as
applied
to
associations
of
over
the
counter
dealers,
thus
trying
the
strengthen
this
positioning
against
in
gordon
by
pointing
to
fact
that
here,
in
fact
there
was
an
antitrust
duty
resting
on
the
sec.
now,
we
submit
that
under
the
prevailing
precedence
of
this
court,
this
complaint
must
be
dismissed
and
i
think
this
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
pan
american
case
and
the
hughes
tool
case.
in
pan
american,
the
court
said
the
acts
charged
as
antitrust
violation
are
precise
ingredients
of
the
court's
authority.
if
the
courts
were
to
intrude
independently
with
their
construction
of
the
antitrust
laws,
two
regimes
might
collide.
dismissal
of
antitrust
suits
where
an
administrator
remedy
supersede
at
the
judicial
one
is
the
usual
course.
in
those
cases
however,
the
cad
which
was
the
administrative
agency
that
was
involved,
filed
briefs
on
the
side
of
the
defendants
and
said
it
had
neither
the
competence
nor
the
authority
to
control
the
acts
alleged
as
antitrust
violations.
here
in
contrast,
the
sec
is
coming
in,
saying
it
has
both
the
competence
and
the
authority
to
control
for
these
matters.
now
let
me
speak
for
just
a
minute
about
the
diagram
which
is
said
to
elucidate
the
government's
position.
in
the
first
place,
it
omits
and
distorts
the
time
dimension,
the
vertical
transactions
are
all
virtually
simultaneous
transactions
whereas
the
horizontal
and
diagonal
transactions
take
place
at
different
times
and
so
are
not
comparable.
one
firm
cannot,
contrary
to
mr.
norton's
assertion
be
a
contract
dealer
and
a
not
contract
dealer
at
the
same
time
with
respect
to
the
same
fund
of
one
for
maybe
a
contract
dealer
as
to
one
fund
in
a
non
contract
dealer
as
to
another
fund
but
that's
irrelevant.
you
can't
be
both
a
contract
dealer
and
a
not
contract
dealer.
second,
since
there
is
not
and
never
has
been
a
brokerage
market.
the
drawing
of
this
thing
called
broke
over
here
is
simply
lies
on
the
paper
that
doesn't
correspond
to
any
reality
for
the
same
reason
the
transaction
label
y
is
simply
imaginary
because
there
isn't
any
such
thing.
third
place,
the
transaction
marked
by
the
same
symbol
x
is
not
a
secondary
trading
market
transaction.
it
is
clearly
part
of
the
primary
distribution
system.
as
part
of
the
primary
distribution
system,
the
x
transaction
is
subject
to
regulation
by
both
the
nasd
and
the
sec,
both
under
section
22
(f)
and
rule
26
of
the
nasd.
the
government
brief
indeed
admits
at
page
53
that
section
22
(d)
permits
the
nasd
and
the
commission
to
regulate
price
and
sales
loads
in
connection
with
the
primary
distribution
market
and
the
sec
is
addressing
itself
to
the
inter-dealer
market.
furthermore,
transaction
x
is
forbidden
by
rule
26
of
the
nasd
which
in
effect
provides
that
only
contract
dealers
are
entitled
to
discounts
and
that
they
shall
purchase
only
in
order
to
fill
investor's
orders.
consequently,
there's
simply
no
economic
incentive
and
no
functional
purpose
served
by
transaction
x.
now,
since
transaction
y
is
imaginary
and
non-existent
and
since
transaction
x
is
prohibited
by
rules
which
are
not
now
attacked
by
the
government,
there
is
simply
no
transaction
shown
on
this
diagram
which
is
restrained
by
any
conduct
of
the
defendants
which
is
under
attack
in
this
lawsuit.
mr.
lee
loevinger
this
is
disputable,
mr.
justice.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
an
argument
made
in
the
nasd
brief
to
the
effect
that
the
term
dealer
is
used
in
a
generic
sense.
however
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
sir.
it
has
the
--
no.
mr.
lee
loevinger
alright,
they
have
never
made
a
ruling
that
a
contract
dealer
can
act
as
a
broker.
they
have
simply
said
that
a
securities
firm
acting
only
in
the
capacity
of
a
broker
may
match
investors
by
a
sale
order.
mr.
lee
loevinger
but
there
is
nothing
charged
in
this
suit
that
would
prevent
that
because
these
are
people
who
by
definition
are
not
subject
to
the
restrictions
of
the
sales
agreements
and
they
are
not
subject
to
any
inhibition
in
the
nasd
rules.
they
are
simply
nothing
in
this
suit
that
is
charged.
mr.
lee
loevinger
if
there
were
different
complaint,
we
might
have
a
different
case,
mr.
justice
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
complaint
nor
may
i
point
out
also
that
the
government
has
filed
an
affidavit
and
30
exhibits
taking
75
pages
of
the
printed
record
from
pages
230
to
305
elucidating
that
the
charges
in
this
complaint.
there
is
no
suggestion
any
where
that
any
thing
that
has
been
done
in
fact
does
suppress
the
independent
brokerage
market.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
would
take
that
position
because
we
think
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
there
is
such
pervasive
regulation
of
all
these
transactions
by
the
sec
that
under
twa
and
pan
american,
the
court
would
hold
that
the
sec
has
the
authority
and
therefore
these
are
not
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
we
think
that
in
that
respect
the
court's
decision
is
right
but
whether
or
not
they
may
or
not
be
some
remote
corner
in
which
independent
non-contract
dealers,
--
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
sec
is
in
fact
acting
and
studying
those
very
matters.
there
isn't
any
question
about
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
that
insofar
as
this
chart
has
any
relevance
to
the
present
case,
what
it
shows
is
first,
that
the
theoretical
model
of
how
the
market
operates
which
is
in
the
minds
of
the
department
of
justice,
government
attorneys
simply
doesn't
correspond
to
reality
and
second,
that
there
simply
is
no
place
where
the
authority
of
the
sec
and
the
jurisdiction
and
the
application
of
the
investment
company
act
and
the
maloney
act
don't
apply.
in
other
words,
that
there
is
precisely
that
kind
of
pervasive
authority
which
the
court
has
said
in
both
twa
and
pan
am
makes
these
things
subject
to
administrative
and
not
to
antitrust
regulation
and
this
is
not
a
case
whereas
in
pan
am,
there
was
potential
conflict
between
the
administrative
and
the
judicial
regimes.
this
is
a
case
in
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes,
sir.
i'm
taking
just
a
few
minutes
of
mr.
north's
time
with
his
permission.
this
is
a
case
in
which
there
is
actual
collision
because
the
regulations
that
have
been
proposed
by
the
sec
staff
are
completely
incompatible
with
the
remedy
that
is
sought
here
by
the
department
of
justice.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
sec
staff
seeks
to
establish
a
possibility
for
the
existence
presumably
under
modern
technology
of
this
alleged
brokerage
market
in
which
case
they
say
the
transaction
y
which
is
a
brokerage
transaction
could
be
subjected
to
a
special
charge
to
be
payable
to
the
underwriter
in
order
to
help
support
the
distribution
system.
now,
as
i
say
this
is
not
a
case
of
potential
conflict.
this
is
a
case
of
actual
conflict
between
the
regulatory
and
the
antitrust
regime.
this
court
has
no
choice
under
is
precedence
but
to
dismiss
the
complaint.
