justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
when
you
get
to
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction
on
the
appeal
of
trial
de
novo
but
i
don't
use
it
with
any
meaning
at
all,
and
you
say
this
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
to
try
me,
that
the
court
passes
on
its
own
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
to
try
me?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
motion
is
made
that
the
superior
court
does
not
have
the
right
to
try
me
because
the
court
is
without
jurisdiction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
one
word
about
jury
trial.
i
said
the
motion
is
made
that
the
court's
without
jurisdiction.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
it
is
denied,
could
you
appeal
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean,
in
massachusetts,
you
make
a
point
that
this
court
is
without
jurisdiction
because
the
judge
is
six-years-old,
and
thereby
on
the
jury
is
dead
that
that
can't
be
appealed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
jurisdiction
is
not
piecemeal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
this
time,
i'll
take
your
word
for
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
invoke
its
jurisdiction
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
they
made
you
file
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
they
made
you
file
this
motion
in
the
superior
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
get
the
beginning.
that's
when
you
filed
it
or
after
it's
completed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
it's
claimed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
this
point
with
this
question
about
having
a
trial
by
jury
on
appeal.
i
know
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
you
go
to
the
supreme
court
of
massachusetts,
you
don't
get
a
jury.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
don't
get
juries
in
appellate
courts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
in
massachusetts
and
how
many
other
states.
justice
thurgood
marshall
eight.
how
many
states
are
there
--
once
you
asked
for
jury
trial,
it
automatically
goes
to
the
court
of
general
jurisdiction?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
several.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
rhode
island
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
several
others.
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
right
close
to
you.
