justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
just
go
across
that
file
and
take
your
appeal,
the
proceeding
is
annulled.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
de
novo
--
it's
a
de
novo
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
go
to
the
superior
court,
what
happens
to
the
judgment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
it's
no
longer
important.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
told
me
it
was
vacated.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
within
your
power
to
annul
that
judgment
by
going,
by
invoking
the
superior
court
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
may
not
have
to
plead
guilty
to
get
the
default
to
get
there.
you
just
have
them
to
get
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
default.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
awhile
ago
you
told
me
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
you
viewed
it
on
the
district
court,
what
if
he
just
doesn't
show
up.
they
are
not
going
to
court
until
today?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
say,
well,
you
can't
default.
they'll
bring
you
to
court
if
you
just
sit
there
--
justice
byron
r.
white
---
so
you
do
have
to
expose
yourself
to
the
state's
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it
may
not
be
much
of
a
trial
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
going
to
be
found
guilty?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
does
the
judgment
of
district
court
become
annulled?
suppose
you
have
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
nothing
happen
--
nobody
divulges
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
the
judgment
basis
in
fact
--
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
suppose
--
does
that
suggest
that
particularly
in
this
case
where
whatever
you
call
it,
a
proceeding
is
now
pending
in
the
superior
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
argument
on
finality
rest
at
all
in
this
case
on
the
fact
that
he
did
claim
an
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
he
did
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
still
say
the
district
court
judgment
is
not
final
for
purposes
of
1257?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
ever
a
fact
in
what
has
happened
under
your
procedure
that
someone's
been
convicted
without
a
jury
in
the
district
court?
taken
by
appeal
to
the
superior
court,
made
the
motion
that
you
suggest
these
privileged
is
there
to
make,
had
it
denied
and
convicted
and
then
gone
to
either
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
judicial
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
in
the
amicus
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
permission
to
campaign?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
way
that
that
you
could
raise
in
the
superior
court
the
question
that
--
the
federal
questions
you
want
us
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
here
you
are
in
the
superior
court
and
you're
taking
a
case
there
for
a
trial
de
novo.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
is
there
some
way
to
present
to
the
superior
court
have
rules
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
out
here
in
the
jury
trial
in
the
superior
court,
can
you
present
the
question
that
you
want
us
to
adjudicate
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
will
up
those
to
the
higher
court
of
massachusetts
just
like
to
present
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
they
entertain
that
in
the
courts
around
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
if
the
answer
to
you
isn't
here,
massachusetts
courts
would
be
just
what
you
say
they
are.
nevertheless,
that's
the
way
it
is,
that
may
be
a
wrong
answer.
it
constitutionally
may
be
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
if
you
could
present
the
issue
in
the
lower
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
can
have
it
suppose
to
rule
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
why
didn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
the
judgment
final?
why
then
have
you
reached
--
how
come
you
have
a
stay
in
the
judgment
of
the
highest
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
--
there
is
no
trial
de
novo
procedure
available
in
largent,
that
was
wholly
federal
habeas
and
they
said
federal
habeas
was
not
available
to
raise
the
constitutional
question
to
solve
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
no
other
place
it
could
go.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be
so
but
the
court
didn't
have.
you
said
there
weren't
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
notice
the
fact
that
over
a
federal
question
where
it
switches
to
federal
remedies
just
when
he
may
