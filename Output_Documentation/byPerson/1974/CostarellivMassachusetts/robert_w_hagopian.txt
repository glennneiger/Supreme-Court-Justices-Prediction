mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
an
appeal
from
a
municipal
court
in
boston.
in
massachusetts,
we
have
what's
commonly
known
as
a
two-tier
trial
de
novo
system.
there
is
a
set
of
lower
courts
that
is
comprised
with
the
district
courts
and
the
municipal
court
of
boston
and
there
is
a
second
tier
in
the
de
novo
procedure
which
is
basically
the
superior
courts.
the
superior
court
and
the
district
courts,
or
the
lower
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
the
most
crimes.
one
limitation
is
that
the
first
tier
or
the
lower
courts
can
only
have
jurisdictions
over
crimes
which
are
punishable
up
to
five
years
in
the
state
prison.
there
are
a
few
exceptions
that
go
up
to
10
years,
burglary
and
breaking
in
and
entering
at
nighttime.
the
district
courts
have
jurisdiction.
in
the
district
courts
in
massachusetts
as
so
construed
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
you
cannot
obtain
a
trial
by
jury
in
the
first
instance.
you
have
the
option
there
of
pleading
not
guilty
and
going
to
trial
or
you
have
the
option
of
pleading
guilty.
if
you're
convicted
after
you
plead
not
guilty,
you
have
supposedly
an
unqualified
and
unfettered
right
for
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
second
tier
of
the
massachusetts
procedure.
if
you
plead
guilty,
you
cannot
get
a
trial
de
novo
in
the
second
tier.
you
may
appeal
the
sentence
itself,
that
is
if
you're
imprisoned,
the
length
of
confinement
but
there
is
no
trial
in
the
second
tier
on
the
merits
of
the
controversy.
there
is
no
procedure
in
the
massachusetts
two-tier
procedure
for
any
appellate
review
of
a
decision
in
the
lower
court
or
lower
tier.
there
are
a
number
of
collateral
remedies
that
are
available
that
is
if
you
go
to
trial
in
the
district
court
and
you're
convicted
and
imprisoned,
you
may
bring
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
there
is
another
writ
called
the
writ
of
error
which
is
unlike
the
writ
of
error
that
used
to
come
to
this
court
many
years
ago
and
it's
what's
normally
known.
that
writ
of
error
is
not
available
for
any
collateral
relief.
it's
an
independent
and
distinct
proceeding.
the
third
possibility
is
to
petition
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
for
extraordinary
relief
under
their
supervisory
powers.
now,
in
this
particular
case,
the
appellant,
steven
costarelli
requested
a
jury
trial
in
the
first
instance.
he
was
charged
with
a
crime
of
which
he
could've
received
two
years
in
prison
and
a
fine.
a
trial
judge
denied
that
motion,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
mr.
costarelli
had
asserted
his
specific
constitutional
rights
and
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
which
he
interprets
that
meaning
as
speedy
trial
by
jury
or
speedy
trial
that
comports
with
constitutional
standards
and
also
his
rights
under
the
double
jeopardy
provisions.
from
the
denial
of
that
motion,
he
brought
--
filed
an
appeal
in
this
case
and
this
case,
the
court
has
set
down
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
i
submit
to
you,
your
honors
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
over
an
appeal
from
the
boston
municipal
court
because
that
court
is
the
highest
state
court
within
the
meaning
of
those
words
in
section
1257.
that
is,
there
is
no
further
appellate
review.
massachusetts'
argument
to
this
case
or
to
this
point
in
jurisdiction
is
very
simply
that
the
appellant
has
the
right
to
trial
de
novo
and
of
course,
that's
what
the
basic
issue
about
what
this
case
is
all
about.
in
terms
of
jurisdiction,
trial
de
novo
is
not
an
appeal
on
the
record
of
the
lower
court
proceedings.
it
grants
a
person
a
new
trial.
there
is
no
means
of
reversing
errors
that
went
on
down
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
certainly
the
issue
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
that
of
course
is
a
very
complicated
question.
but
the
answer
to
that
is
that
i
think
that
it
is
this,
that
after
he
has
gone
up
to
the
superior
court
and
he
raises
--
he
can
raise
the
issue
of
double
jeopardy
in
the
form
of
a
motion
on
that
bar.
i
don't
believe
he
can
collaterally
attack
what
went
down
in
the
district
court
of
the
denial
of
a
jury
trial
is
a
pure
reversible
error.
it
may
be
mooted
by
the
fact
that
if
the
judge
denies
this
motion
to
bar
in
the
superior
court
and
he's
granted
a
jury
trial
and
he's
convicted
there,
then
he's
had
a
jury
trial
and
the
issue
may
be
moot.
that
is
if
you
consider
the
fact
that
a
denial
of
a
jury
trial
is
purely
a
reversible
error
for
getting
the
double
jeopardy
claim
with
the
speedy
trial
claim
if
it
is
purely
a
reversible
error,
it's
been
cured
by
the
fact
that
he
has
a
jury
trial.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
that's
quite
correct.
i
have
that
issue
now
before
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
and
that
case
is
currently
being
litigated
there
but
i
don't
think
that
that
cuts
away
from
this
court's
jurisdiction.
a
man
who's
tried
down
in
the
district
court,
the
municipal
court
of
boston,
he
does
not
have
to
suffer
a
second
trial
before
he
can
get
appellate
review
in
this
court.
that
is
the
foundation
of
which
this
court's
jurisdiction
is
predicated
under
section
1257.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
that's
not
correct.
i
don't
believe
that's
correct
because
then
it
would
not
be
a
judgment
from
which
an
appeal
could
be
taken.
it
was
simply
a
denial
of
a
motion.
he
would
have
had
to
gone
through
the
trial
in
the
superior
court.
he
can't
appeal
from
the
denial
of
a
motion
in
superior
court.
he
can
only
appeal
under
section
1257
from
a
denial
of
a
judgment.
that
is
from
the
final
judgment
of
superior
court.
that
would
be
piecemeal
adjudication
of
the
trial
or
the
proceedings
in
the
superior
court
and
i
don't
believe
the
jurisdiction
would
lie
under
that
procedure.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that
--
unless
he's
completed
the
trial
in
the
superior
court,
then
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
because
the
superior
court
is
not
the
highest
state
court
within
the
meaning
of
those
words.
he
would
have
to
go
all
the
way
up
through
the
ladder
through
the
appeals
court
in
massachusetts
and
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
and
let
me
just
state
for
the
record
and
perhaps
that's
not
too
clear,
it
should
be
clear
on
the
record,
mr.
costarelli
has
lodged
an
appeal
for
trial
de
novo
in
the
superior
court.
that
was
done
under
compulsion
and
i
don't
believe
that
he
should've
been
forced
to
elect
his
remedies
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
it
is
and
the
chief
justice
of
superior
court
has
stated
those
proceedings
pending
the
disposition
of
this
case.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
the
only
record
that
technically
goes
up,
a
complaint
is
filed
in
the
district
court,
if
he's
found
guilty,
that
record
and
the
disposition
that
goes
on
the
district
court
goes
up
to
the
superior
court.
other
than
that,
there
is
no
record
in
the
district
court
and
you
cannot
collaterally
attack
anything
that
went
on
in
the
district
court.
it's
a
trial
de
novo,
that's
what's
meant
by
trial
de
novo
in
the
definition,
that
is
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
if
you
bring
a
motion
for
extraordinary
belief
--
relief
in
the
supreme
judicial
court
from
proceedings
in
the
district
court,
nothing
goes
up.
the
record
does
not
go
up.
you
must
file
a
complaint
just
like
you
would
initiate
in
civil
proceedings.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no.
that
is
if
you
are
an
aggrieved
defendant
in
a
district
court
proceeding
and
you
want
it
to
go
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
under
their
supervisory
powers,
you
would
have
to
swear
out
a
complaint
just
like
you
would
in
a
federal
district
court.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
right.
the
record
does
not
go
up
and
of
course,
that's
a
crucial
issue
to
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
understand
that
question.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
the
superior
court?
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
the
superior
court
in
massachusetts
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
he
did
not
have
a
jury
trial
in
the
district
court
affects
the
jurisdiction
of
the
superior
court.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
suppose
you
could
make
it
your
honor
but
i
don't
know
why
it
should
be
denied
because
it's
the
only
thing
that
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
not
without
going
through
a
trial,
your
honor,
no.
not
in
the
massachusetts
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
procedures
in
the
massachusetts
system
that
allow
piecemeal
adjudication
of
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
understand
that
from
a
federal
viewpoint,
your
honor
to
a
certain
extent
but
i
don't
believe
massachusetts,
if
there
is
remedy
for
getting
into
an
appellate
court
other
than
going
through
a
trial
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
yes,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
i
said
that.
when
costarelli
was
convicted
in
the
district
court,
we
appealed.
i
appealed
for
him
and
he
has
a
pending
trial
de
novo
in
the
superior
court.
the
proceedings
in
the
superior
court
have
been
stayed
by
order
of
the
chief
justice
of
the
superior
court
pending
the
resolution
of
this
case
in
this
court
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
because
mr.
costarelli
has
elected
to
go
forward
with
that,
he
still
has
the
right
to
come
to
this
court
alleging
that
that
is
the
highest
state
court,
the
district
court
in
massachusetts.
the
fact
that
he
elected
a
trial
de
novo
cannot
constitute
a
waiver
of
his
federal
rights
under
section
1257.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no
there
is
not
your
honor.
he
may
not
even
waive
a
trial
like
in
colten
versus
kentucky.
there
is
some
language
in
this
court
and
i
believe
it's
a
procedure
in
colten
where
you
could
circumnavigate
a
trial.
you
must
stand
trial
and
i
believe
my
brother
concedes
this.
there's
no
means
of
waiving
a
trial
in
the
district
court
of
massachusetts.
you
must
stand
trial
and
if
you
remain
silent,
the
court
convicts
you,
you
stand
guilty
and
the
burden
is
upon
you
in
the
superior
court.
if
you
default,
if
you
do
not
show
up
in
the
superior
court,
judgment
will
be
entered
in
the
superior
court
under
the
massachusetts
statute
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
in
the
district
court
will
be
imposed
upon
you,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
you
have
never
waived
your
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
that's
not
true,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
there
are
collateral
consequences
that
are
very
serious.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
it's
a
de
novo
matter
but
there
are
collateral
consequences
that
are
attached.
very
serious
ones.
in
costarelli's
case,
the
statute
provides
that
whoever
uses
a
power
without
authority,
if
he's
convicted
in
the
district
court,
his
license
will
be
revoked,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he's
appealed.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
technically
in
terms
of
fiction,
it's
vacated.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
not
strictly
true
because
of
the
fact
that
you
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
it
is
but
if
you
default
in
the
superior
court,
it
is
then
imposed.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct
but
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
when
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
you
mean
in
the
district
courts
in
massachusetts?
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
you
must
have
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
you
can't
default.
judgment
will
not
be
entered
by
default
in
criminal
proceedings
in
the
massachusetts
court.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
i
think
i
didn't
say
that.
what
i
meant
was
that
in
the
superior
court
upon
trial
de
novo,
if
you
default
there,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
where
you
have
been
found
guilty
will
now
be
imposed
upon
you.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
you
can't
default.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
there
are
serious
consequences
because
if
you
remain
silent,
and
the
government
puts
their
witnesses
on
and
then
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
it's
more
than
that.
if
those
witnesses
die
in
between
the
district
court
and
superior
court,
their
unimpeached
testimony
will
be
introduced
against
you
in
the
superior
court
so
there's
a
certain
amount
of
risk
to
take
in
that
procedure.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
true.
it
is
a
true
preliminary
hearing
but
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
a
preliminary
hearing
and
a
trial
and
that
point
was
brought
up
in
callan
versus
wilson.
and
justice
harlan,
the
first
justice
harlan
of
this
court
said,
there's
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
a
preliminary
hearing
and
a
trial
in
the
de
novo
system
and
that
the
trial
in
our
massachusetts
system
like
it
was
under
the
dc
procedure
here
is
a
full
trial
in
the
full
sense
that
there
is.
in
a
preliminary
hearing,
if
you
default
in
a
superior
court,
there
isn't
going
to
be
any
judgment
that's
entered
against
you
and
that's
the
difference.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
and
the
difficulty
with
that
is
that
the
massachusetts
system
attaches
collateral
consequences
to
that
judgment.
it's
not
totally
vacated.
your
driver's
license
may
be
yanked.
if
you're
on
probation,
you
will
automatically
be
sent
to
jail
and
those
collateral
consequences
are
very
severe
and
this
court
has
affirmed
those
collateral
consequences
in
the
case
last
term.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
you
can't
nullify
the
collateral
consequences
you
see
because
of
the
fact
in
the
massachusetts
procedure,
the
statutes
that
empower
the
registrar
say
to
yank
your
motor
vehicle
license.
they're
entirely
separate.
that's
not
part
of
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
they
independently
give
powers
to
attach
to
these
collateral
consequences.
they
are
no
vacated
by
the
district
court
judgment
and
they
are
imposed
and
i
raised
that
issue
in
a
three-judge
court
last
year
in
the
federal
district
court
and
they
refused
to
declare
that
that
procedure
was
being
--
putting
a
price
on
what's
supposed
to
be
his
unfettered
right
of
appeal.
and
this
court
affirmed
that
decision
so
i
would
assume
that
that
procedure
is
done.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
the
end.
there
is
no
further
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
the
government
has
no
more
trials.
that's
the
end
of
all
the
matters.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
then
yes,
then
you
are
declared
innocent
and
then
the
registrar
has
to
give
you
your
license
back
but
you
see,
it's
that
intervening
time
between
the
district
court
and
the
superior
court
that
is
the
nub
of
the
matter.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
let
me
say
this.
the
collateral
consequences
are
not
part
of
the
judgment.
there
are
separate
statutes
that
are
involved.
the
judgment
is
technically
vacated
but
if
you
default
in
the
superior
court,
the
superior
court
judge
has
the
power
to
pass
sentence
on
you
when
you're
not
even
there
in
default.
he
passes
the
sentence
of
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
it
is,
it
exactly
is.
it
is
an
appeal
and
it's
an
appeal
like
colten
v.
kentucky
is
an
appeal.
and
that
of
course
goes
to
the
nub
of
the
matter
and
let
me
just
say
this
on
the
issue
of
colten.
in
colten,
the
record
isn't
transmitted
up
the
superior
court.
it's
a
real
true
de
novo
system
here.
in
the
massachusetts
system,
the
judge
and
jury,
everybody
knows
where
these
cases
came
from.
they
know
that
the
man
has
been
convicted.
in
addition
to
that
of
course,
the
critical
issue
in
colten
was
that
colten
was
entitled
to
a
trial
by
jury
in
the
first
instance.
let
me
just
say
briefly
on
the
merits
of
this
case,
i
think
that
the
large
issue,
the
broad
issue
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
rule
of
callan
versus
wilson
is
incorporated
and
the
state
should
be
bound.
i
think
that
the
real
broad
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
states
have
a
right
to
deny
a
person
a
specific
procedural
constitutional
right,
whether
it's
the
right
to
counsel
or
whether
it's
the
right
to
an
impartial
judge
or
it's
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
i
don't
believe
it's
any
answer
for
the
state
to
say,
we
will
give
you
a
trial
de
novo.
i
think
a
man
is
entitled
to
those
rights
in
the
first
instance,
right
to
counsel,
right
to
trial
by
jury,
right
to
an
impartial
judge
and
it's
no
answer
on
the
part
of
massachusetts
or
the
other
states
to
simply
say
we
will
give
these
to
you
after
we've
subjected
you
and
you're
forced
with
a
stigma
of
a
conviction
of
guilty.
now,
i
don't
--
i
think
trial
de
novo's
have
a
legitimate
place
and
purposes
of
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
the
state
system
and
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
abolish
trial
de
novo.
all
i'm
asking
them
to
do
was
to
say
that
massachusetts
must
do
what
rhode
island
has
to
do,
that
when
a
defendant
comes
before
the
district
court,
if
he
doesn't
want
to
proceed
at
that
stage
of
the
proceedings,
he
should
have
a
right
to
circumnavigate
that
trial
and
go
right
to
the
superior
court
or
the
state
has
to
give
him
a
trial
by
jury
in
the
first
instance.
that's
the
only
thing
that
i'm
asking
for.
i'm
not
asking
to
take
the
whole
to
trial
de
novo
system
down.
that
request
would
have
some
serious
consequences.
if
the
state
wants
to
give
somebody
a
trial
de
novo
as
an
equivalent
to
an
appellate
remedy,
i
think
that's
fine.
i
see
nothing
wrong
with
that
as
the
procedure
in
colten
but
i
do
object
to
the
fact
that
the
state
of
massachusetts
can
deny
somebody
his
specific
sixth
amendment
constitutional
rights
and
i
think
that
that's
what
the
heart
of
this
case
is
all
about.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
no,
your
honor.
that's
the
procedure
in
rhode
island
now
and
well,
it's
a
procedure
in
kentucky
in
the
colten
case.
you
have
a
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
i
have
no
objections
to
this.
the
double
jeopardy
issue
is
that
i
don't
think
that
a
person
should
have
to
suffer
two
trials
to
get
what
he's
entitled
to
at
least
once
and
this
court
just
recently
and
i
guess
it
was
wilson
versus
united
states
a
few
weeks
ago
held
that
the
real
underlying
prohibitions
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
that
the
multiple
trials.
the
trial
process
itself
is
impaired
but
that
may
result
as
a
manifest
necessity.
obviously,
all
trials
can't
be
perfect.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct.
i'm
not
arguing
that
they
have
to
provide
review
at
all.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
mr.
chief
justice,
the
massachusetts
defenders
committee
filed
a
brief
that
i
received
last
friday
and
i
would
like
to
ask
leave
of
court
to
file
a
reply
brief
to
that
brief.
either
that
or
i
would
oppose
its
admissions
at
this
late
date.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
it
probably
hasn't
even
got
here
your
honor
and
i'm
opposed
to
its
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
assented
to
it
at
that
time
your
honor
but
--
yes
i
did
but
i
didn't
assent
to
it
being
delivered
here
after
oral
arguments
or
the
time
of
oral
arguments.
i
haven't
had
sufficient
time
to
reply
to
that
brief
and
there
are
matters
in
there
that
need
their
discussion.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
could
i
have
leave
to
file
a
written
response
to
that?
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
a
couple
of
small
points
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
your
honor,
this
is
an
informer's
propers
case
and
i
have
to
send
those
down
to
washington.
the
printer
is
down
here
take
some
time.
would
i
be
asking
for
too
much
with
21
days?
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
oh,
fine.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct
your
honor.
yes.
could
i
have
14
days?
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
one
thing
i
would
like
to
mention
to
mr.
justice
white,
there
is
a
procedure
in
massachusetts
called
submitting
to
a
finding
of
facts
in
the
lower
court
which
is
equivalent
to
what
you
mentioned.
you
simply
remained
silent.
the
government
doesn't
have
to
complete
--
put
all
the
evidence
and
will
follow
the
rules
of
evidence,
that
is
hearsay
and
things
like
that
go
in.
that's
an
informal
procedure.
you
still
are
judged
guilty
and
there
is
no
way
of
circumnavigating
that
and
a
sentence
is
passed
upon
you.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
would
suppose
the
double
jeopardy
issue
certainly
could
be
raised.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
it
depends
upon
whether
it's
a
reversible
error.
the
only
other
possibility
is
to
simply
allege
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
but
that's
a
fiction.
it
had
jurisdiction
over
the
crime.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
other
than
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
double
jeopardy,
the
answer
is
no.
there
is
no
possible
way
of
reviewing
any
error.
let
me
give
you
a
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
suppose
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
sure,
the
only
grounds
you
could
allege
in
the
highest
court
in
massachusetts
is
that
the
trial
judge
in
the
superior
court
made
a
mistake
when
he
denied
my
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
grounds
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
certainly.
but
if
the
denial
of
a
trial
by
jury
in
the
first
instance
is
a
purely
reversible
error
and
it's
not
double
jeopardy,
then
the
claim
that
he's
denied
a
trial
by
jury
in
the
first
instance
is
automatically
mooted
by
the
fact
that
he
now
has
had
a
trial
by
jury
and
that's
what
the
difficulty
is.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
it's
not
mooted
here
because
of
the
fact
that
in
costarelli's
case,
the
chief
justice
of
the
superior
court
has
stayed
the
trial
de
novo.
he
stayed
those
proceedings.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
absolutely.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
the
issue
of
mootness
yes.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
i
have
in
costarelli's
case.
that
motion
is
pending
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
because
of
the
fact
that
that
is
a
collateral
means
of
reviewing
that
judgment
in
the
district
court
of
massachusetts,
it's
a
collateral
means,
a
man
should
not
have
to
suffer
a
second
trial
to
review
the
error
that
was
made
in
the
district
court
and
that
is
the
nub
of
section
1257.
that's
largent
versus
texas.
a
man
should
not
have
to
collaterally
attack.
the
only
issue
as
to
whether
the
jurisdiction
in
this
court
is
pending
is
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
believe
in
largent,
they
said
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
believe
that
there
were
collateral
remedies
open
in
the
texas
system
in
largent
in
which
he
could've
raised
the
issue
collaterally.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
oh,
i
believe
this
court
mentioned
it
in
this
--
in
its
opinion.
it
said
and
i
quote
to
you
your
honor.
it
says
that
the
fact
that
there
were
collateral
remedies
open
does
not
affect
this
court's
jurisdiction
and
that
is
the
key
--
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
it
says
it
but
this
court
stated,
it
says
the
possibility
that
the
appellant
might
obtain
release
by
a
subsequent
and
distinct
proceedings
and
one
not
in
the
nature
of
the
review
of
the
pending
charge,
in
the
same
or
a
different
court
of
a
state
does
not
affect
the
finality
of
an
existing
judgment
or
the
fact
that
this
judgment
was
obtain
in
the
highest
state
court
available
to
the
appellant.
i
read
that
language
as
simply
saying
that
because
a
man
may
collaterally
attack
a
judgment
in
the
district
court
or
the
lower
court
in
massachusetts
is
irrelevant
to
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
1257.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
well,
that
remedy
was
taken
under
compulsion.
supposing
i
hadn't
taken
that
remedy,
i
don't
think
the
fact
what
i
did
in
the
state
court
should
affect
this
court's
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
an
entirely
different
matter.
the
fact
that
a
man
should
not
have
to
go
through
a
second
trial,
a
second
trial,
that
does
not
review
the
record
of
the
first
court.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
hagopian
thank
you.
