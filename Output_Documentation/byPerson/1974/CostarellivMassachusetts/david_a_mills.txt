mr.
david
a.
mills
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
asked
a
single
critical
question
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
however
by
way
of
introductory
overview,
i
would
like
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
massachusetts
has
presented
a
brief
with
five
parts
and
hopefully
we
will
argue
today
in
five
parts.
those
parts
are
first
in
accordance
with
rule
16,
the
question
of
jurisdiction
and
by
way
of
introduction,
we
suggest
that
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
because
this
appeal
fails
of
the
prerequisite
statutory
jurisdictional
prerequisites
in
section
1257.
our
second
point
will
be
that
the
massachusetts
jury
procedure
as
it
currently
exists
is
a
system
which
is
basic
and
fundamental
and
is
justifiable
as
adequate
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
standards
that
have
been
enunciated
by
this
court.
our
third
position
as
presented
in
the
brief
will
be
that
the
massachusetts
jury
system
as
it
presently
is
in
practice
is
a
procedure
and
system
which
provides
for
the
function
and
purpose
of
jury
trial
in
america
as
has
been
enunciated
in
standards
and
decisions
by
this
court.
our
fourth
position
will
be
that
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial
is
not
properly
an
issue
before
this
court
and
our
final
position
will
be
that
double
jeopardy
and
the
claim
of
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy
in
this
case
is
controlled
by
this
court's
decision
on
colten
versus
kentucky.
first
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
massachusetts
suggests
that
the
prerequisites
of
section
1257
have
not
been
satisfied.
we
suggest
that
for
purposes
of
an
appeal
to
this
court,
pursuant
to
1257,
there
are
three
prerequisites.
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
must
be
final.
the
judgment
of
the
state
court
must
be
of
the
highest
court
in
which
a
decision
could
be
had
and
for
purposes
of
appeal
under
subsection
2
of
section
1257,
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
statute
must
have
been
drawn
in
question
with
a
determination
in
favor
of
its
validity
and
massachusetts
suggests
that
each
of
these
statutory
prerequisites
are
missing
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
finality,
this
court
has
stated
that
no
self-enforcing
formula
can
be
defined
as
to
determine
when
a
state
judgment
can
be
final.
and
as
early
as
1869,
in
the
case
of
thomson
versus
dean,
this
court
implicitly
rejected
a
mechanical
application
of
a
formula
of
finality
speaking
rather
in
terms
of
the
degree
of
finality
essential
to
appeal.
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
we
have
extracted
from
the
decisions
of
this
court,
principles
that
we
suggest
should
go
into
a
determination
of
the
degree
of
finality
and
our
primary
principles
upon
which
we
suggest
this
issue
should
be
determined
are
suggestions
from
the
cases
of
richfield
oil
corporation,
market
street
railway
company
and
banks
versus
california
which
are
all
cited
at
page
5
and
the
criteria
that
we
suggest
are
controlling
are
these,
that
the
judgment
--
the
state
judgment
in
order
to
be
final
must
be
an
effective
determination
of
the
litigation
and
subject
to
no
further
review
or
correction
in
any
other
state
tribunal,
that
is
the
first
criteria
and
the
second;
that
available
appellate
review
within
the
state
court
system
be
pursued
if
available.
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
has
spoken
to
the
nature
of
the
de
novo
review,
most
recently
in
mann
versus
commonwealth
which
is
also
cited
in
our
brief.
that
trial
court
has
said
that
upon
the
de
novo
review,
the
district
court
proceeding
is
wiped
out
entirely
and
transferred
to
the
superior
court
are
all
questions
with
respect
to
the
case,
guilt,
sentencing
power
and
all
related
matters.
mr.
david
a.
mills
when
the
appeal
is
claimed
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes.
mr.
david
a.
mills
as
far
as
i
know,
your
honor.
when
the
appeal
is
claimed,
it
transfers
the
whole
case
for
redetermination
completely
divorced
from
the
earlier
proceedings.
mr.
david
a.
mills
well,
the
collateral
consequences
your
honor
i
suggest,
this
point
has
also
been
raised
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
massachusetts
defenders
committee.
they
suggest
as
does
the
appellant
that
this
court
should
enter
an
order
or
take
some
action
suggesting
that
the
massachusetts
defendant
at
the
district
court
level
should
be
able
to
waive
a
trial
and
proceed
directly
to
a
jury
because
of
the
collateral
ancillary
inconveniences
of
a
district
court
adjudication
of
guilt.
however,
each
of
these
positions,
the
position
of
the
amicus
and
the
position
of
the
appellant,
i
suggest
are
based
upon
an
independent
due
process
question
with
respect
to
driver's
licenses.
that
is
not
the
question
that
is
before
this
court.
i
believe
it's
an
important
question
but
not
a
question
that
goes
to
whether
or
not
this
particular
judgment
is
final.
we
suggest
that
the
redetermination
of
the
question
of
guilt
or
innocence
which
is
available
in
the
superior
court
explicitly
contraindicates
that
the
earlier
boston
municipal
court
decision
determined
this
matter
and
in
that
regard
we
suggest
that
the
boston
municipal
court
judgment
is
not
final.
additionally,
we
suggest
that
the
decision
made
by
the
boston
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
we
do
not
know
that
of
record
your
honor,
however,
what
we
do
know
of
record
is
that
at
the
time
that
this
particular
appellant
who
was
a
defendant
in
the
boston
municipal
court
on
the
day
that
he
was
found
guilty
in
the
boston
municipal
court,
the
record
indicates
that
he
claimed
an
appeal.
as
of
record,
we
do
not
know
what
happened
to
that
appeal
or
where
it
is.
mr.
david
a.
mills
no,
your
honor,
the
option
is
available
to
this
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
whether
he
did
or
not.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor
because
he
had
available
to
him
under
massachusetts
law,
a
redetermination
and
i
equate
redetermination
somehow
with
the
fact
that
it
has
not
been
fully
determined
if
it
is
subject
to
redetermination.
mr.
david
a.
mills
his
issue
here
your
honor
is
whether
or
not
he
was
deprived
of
a
federally
protected
constitutional
right
when
he
was
not
provided
with
a
jury
in
the
first
instance
at
the
district
court.
mr.
david
a.
mills
your
honor,
that
question
was
explicitly
noted
by
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
in
a
september
1974
decision
which
has
been
submitted
to
this
court
as
an
amendment
to
the
appellant's
original
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
david
a.
mills
correct.
mr.
david
a.
mills
well,
he
wouldn't
be
presenting
it
to
the
superior
court,
your
honor.
he
would
be
presenting
it
either
to
the
massachusetts
appeals
court
or
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court.
mr.
david
a.
mills
well,
i
don't
think
that
he
would
say
the
conviction
was
invalid.
he
would
--
yes,
he
would
say
the
conviction
was
invalid.
let
me
answer
your
question
your
honor,
you
said
by
what
vehicle?
mr.
david
a.
mills
the
defendant
in
the
superior
court
would
file
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
at
the
superior
court
level
because
the
case
was
improperly
there
because
he
was
not
afforded
a
jury
trial
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
he
did
your
honor.
he
still
has
the
jurisdiction
to
move
that
court
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
failure
of
constitutional
prerequisites
at
the
district
court
level
and
were
that
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
denied
at
the
superior
court
level,
he
would
take
an
exception
and
take
his
properly,
if
acquitted
--
excuse
me,
if
found
guilty,
take
his
properly
perfected
exception
to
the
massachusetts
appeals
court
as
of
right
and
under
certain
conditions
to
the
massachusetts
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
he
says
that
it
was
error
for
the
superior
court
to
not
grant
his
motion
to
dismiss
because
he
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
first
instance
and
he
did
not
receive
it.
therefore,
there
is
error,
therefore
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
suggest
that's
hypothetical
your
honor
and
contraindicated
by
the
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
it
has
not
happened
to
my
knowledge
and
i
believe
we
would
know.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
suggest
your
honor
that
if
the
massachusetts
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
well,
if
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
has
suggested
in
its
opinion
of
whitmarsh
versus
the
commonwealth
that
that
is
an
available
vehicle
for
a
plaintiff
similarly
situated
then
i
suggest
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
september
of
1974
your
honor,
whitmarsh
versus
commonwealth.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
this
is
not
the
whitmarsh
case.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
and
we
claim
that
it
is
adequate
your
honor.
so
it
is
brief.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i'm
saying
that
that
is
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
say
that
it's
open
to
him
and
if
futility
were
a
principle
of
finality,
then
perhaps
finality
would
be
defeated
because
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
law,
the
supreme
judicial
court
has
since
the
filing
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
in
this
case
considered
this
constitutional
issue
twice
in
two
different
courts.
mr.
david
a.
mills
correct
your
honor
and
that's
why
i
say
if
utility
were
and
which
it
is
not.
mr.
david
a.
mills
there
is
a
procedural
vehicle
which
is
general
law
chapter
211
section
3
under
which
this
particular
question
has
reached
the
highest
massachusetts
court
twice.
only
in
each
instance
although
the
court
did
consider
the
issue,
it's
said
that
it
was
doing
so
for
a
matter
or
convenience
and
that
the
particular
vehicle
had
been
improperly
used
and
so
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
no
direct
route
from
the
boston
municipal
court
to
the
supreme
judicial
court.
it
requires
that
the
intermediate
courts,
the
superior
court
and
the
massachusetts
appeals
court
be
utilized.
mr.
david
a.
mills
in
whitmarsh
your
honor,
it
was
an
interlocutory
petition
seeking
the
extraordinary
relief
powers
in
our
highest
appellate
court
under
general
laws
211
section
3
and
the
court
while
noting
that
the
vehicle
for
relief
was
improperly
invoked,
nonetheless,
briefly
gave
its
opinion
as
to
the
determination
of
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
david
a.
mills
no,
your
honor,
not
with
respect
to
an
argument
on
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
section
1257.
mr.
david
a.
mills
no,
costarelli
is
before
this
court.
mr.
david
a.
mills
oh,
correct.
excuse
me
your
honor.
whitmarsh
is.
i
would
suggest
however
that
the
question
of
finality
is
not
to
be
determined
simply
on
that
basis.
the
question
of
finality
we
suggest
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
means
that
the
appellate
review
be
pursued
in
this
particular
case
and
it
was
not
pursued
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
david
a.
mills
with
respect
to
jurisdiction?
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
the
boston
municipal
court
we
suggest
for
purposes
of
jurisdiction
is
not
the
highest
court
in
massachusetts
in
which
a
decision
could
be
had
on
this
question
and
i
don't
think
that
i
need
go
on
at
length.
i
have
suggested
that
the
superior
court
could
make
a
determination.
it
is
a
higher
court
that
the
massachusetts
appeals
court
was
available
to
this
appellant
as
a
matter
of
right,
that
is
a
still
higher
court
and
that
further
and
substituted
hearings
might
have
been
available
before
the
supreme
judicial
court
which
is
a
still
higher
and
our
highest
court
in
massachusetts.
we
recognize
that
the
highest
court
in
which
a
decision
could
be
had
need
not
be
the
highest
appellate
court
of
the
state.
nonetheless,
we
suggest
that
this
question
could
have
reached
the
supreme
judicial
court
and
because
that
is
the
highest
court
in
which
a
decision
could
be
had,
this
particular
judgment
is
not.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
raised
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
determination
of
the
boston
municipal
court
could
be
reviewed
in
another
court
upon
the
record
made
in
the
district
court.
i
think
that
that
is
a
critical
question.
i
think
that
the
answer
is
critical
to
each
side
in
this
particular
case.
in
largent
versus
texas
which
is
cited
i'm
sure,
i
know
in
each
of
the
briefs,
this
court
seems
to
have
established
a
rule
that
if
the
conviction
in
the
lower
court
is
not
examinable
in
a
higher
court
on
the
record
made
in
the
lower
court
then
the
question
has
been
finally
determined
for
purposes
of
section
1257.
if
that
is
the
rule
that
has
been
established
by
this
court,
we
suggest
that
mechanically,
the
boston
municipal
court
judgment
cannot
be
reviewed
in
another
massachusetts
court
on
the
record
made
in
the
massachusetts
court.
however,
an
application
of
that
rule,
we
have
suggested
would
not
really
do
justice
to
the
substance
of
the
fact
and
to
the
point
in
this
case
to
which
there
seems
to
be
no
contest
whatsoever.
the
matter
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
the
district
court
judge
was
correct
in
denying
a
motion
for
a
new
trial,
each
of
those
two
determinations
made
by
the
lower
court
are
subject
to
redetermination.
we
suggest
accordingly
that
there
has
been
not
a
determination,
a
final
determination
sufficient
for
purposes
of
section
1257.
mr.
david
a.
mills
no,
i
don't
fully
underst
--
to
the
extent
that
i
read
largent,
it
seems
to
be
opposite
to
the
position
that
i
argue
to
you
today.
yes,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
be.
i'm
not
convinced
that
it
is.
however,
i
am
suggesting
that
in
this
court,
the
substance
of
the
determinations
made
by
that
lower
court
have
not
been
fully
determined
and
under
the
explicit
language
of
the
statute,
there
has
been
no
final
determination.
mr.
david
a.
mills
if
largent
says
what
i
believe
it
says
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
significant
departure.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
or
to
be
made
more
explicit
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
believe
it
does,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
of
the
record,
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
of
the
determinations
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
largent
disturbs
the
commonwealth
your
honor
because
it
seems
to
explicitly
establish
a
rule
which
cannot
be
complied
with
in
this
case
and
we
suggest
that
a
mechanical
application
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
if
largent
requires
a
record,
there
is
no
record
here
your
honor.
we
suggest
there
need
be
no
record
in
view
of
the
redetermination.
mr.
david
a.
mills
excuse
me,
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
didn't
hear
you,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
no.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
the
record
is
clean.
he
is
still
held
as
a
criminal
defendant
on
separate
process
for
a
separate
proceeding
which
has
been
elected
at
his
option
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
three
other
options,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
the
language
--
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
the
language
of
wiping
the
record
clean
comes
directly
from
mann
versus
commonwealth.
mr.
david
a.
mills
he
is
still
a
criminal
defendant,
subject
to
process
and
subject
to
further
involvement
in
criminal
proceedings
in
massachusetts.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
i
would
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
in
view
of
this
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
he
is,
he
remains
in
jeopardy.
mr.
david
a.
mills
no,
he
is
--
yes,
he
is
again
in
jeopardy
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
suggest
that
it
is
wiped
away
your
honor.
the
district
court
proceeding
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
not
if
second
is
equivalent
with
double
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
perhaps
this
is
inappropriately
labeled
under
massachusetts
procedure
as
an
appeal
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
particular
name
or
denomination
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
it
is
a
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
two
adjudications
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
there
are
two
trials.
well,
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
the
massachusetts
procedure
by
which
a
criminal
defendant
may
undergo
two
trials
complies,
it
may
not
be
the
best
system.
we
did
not
suggest
in
our
brief
that
it
was
the
best
available
system.
we
do
not
argue
today
that
it's
the
best
available
system.
we
suggested
it
is
a
system
that
complies
with
this
court's
decision
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
which
says
that
state
criminal
defendants
be
afforded
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
we
say
that
it
adequately
complies
with
this
fourteenth
amendment
requirement
and
at
the
outset
we
suggest
that
the
court
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
did
not
incorporate
callan
versus
wilson
and
if
this
court
did
incorporate
callan
versus
wilson
in
that
doctrine
in
the
decision
of
duncan
versus
louisiana,
that
the
callan
decision
should
be
reviewed
because
it
is
based
upon
a
suggestion
of
hypothetical
reasons
which
are
not
the
practical
fact
in
this
case.
mr.
david
a.
mills
correct.
mr.
david
a.
mills
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
we
could
call
it
in
de
novo
states
your
honor,
we
have
suggested
that
there
are
eight
in
the
brief.
mr.
david
a.
mills
we
do
not
know
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
the
interaction
of
the
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
rhode
island
no
longer
is
one
--
oh!
yes,
rhode
island
now
is
one
under
the
holliday
decision.
mr.
david
a.
mills
there
are
others
but
the
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
it
is
close.
new
hampshire
is
equally
as
close
your
honor
and
has
a
different
system.
we
have
examined
in
our
brief
the
colonial
constitutional
history
of
the
original
states
and
we
find
that
the
de
novo
system
existed
in
massachusetts
dating
from
1647,
in
new
hampshire
from
1679,
from
vermont,
connecticut,
rhode
island
and
maine
from
the
early
1700s.
we
suggest
that
this
constitutional
colonial
analysis
in
the
brief
is
appropriate
in
view
of
the
criteria
that
were
used
by
this
court
in
duncan
versus
louisiana,
the
williams
case,
the
apodaca
case
and
the
other
recent
cases
in
which
this
court
has
considered
the
jury
trial
right
with
respect
to
state
procedures.
we
have
examined
contemporary
practices
among
the
states
as
this
court
did
in
duncan
versus
louisiana
and
the
results
are
contained
in
the
brief.
we
have
suggested
that
the
massachusetts
jury
procedure
fulfills
the
function
and
purpose
of
jury,
that
is
the
interposition
of
the
common
sense
judgment
of
the
group
of
laymen
between
an
accuser
and
his
accused.
in
this
regard,
we
would
respectfully
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
brief
of
the
amicus
file
by
the
massachusetts
defenders
committee
which
i
think
says
better
than
the
appellee
has
said
in
its
brief
that
far
from
being
oppressive,
indeed
the
particular
massachusetts
jury
procedure
system
in
question
here
may
even
contraindicate
inconvenience
let
alone
governmental
oppression.
finally,
we
have
suggested
that
the
speedy
trial
right
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
as
there
is
no
measurable
period
of
delay
by
which
this
court
can
assess
a
delay
in
the
terms
of
the
criteria
of
barker
versus
wingo
and
we
have
suggested
that
the
massachusetts
procedure
is
not
violative
of
double
jeopardy
in
view
of
this
court's
decision
in
colten
versus
kentucky.
thank
you.
