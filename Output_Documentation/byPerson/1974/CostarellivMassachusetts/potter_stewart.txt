justice
potter
stewart
of
course
you
would
be
in
the
superior
court
only
because
you
as
the
defendant
had
invoked
its
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
kind
of
an
odd
thing
to
go
in
there
and
invoke
its
jurisdiction
and
file
a
motion
to
say
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
is
there
any
way
in
the
massachusetts
system
whereby
mr.
costarelli
could
have
bypassed
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
true
of
a
preliminary
hearing
too
though
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
another
side
of
the
coin
and
that
is
if
you
stand
mute
and
hear
the
state's
evidence,
you
know
what
the
state's
case
is.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
you
just
admitted
to
mr.
justice
white
that
you
could
nullify
that
entire
effect?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
a
peculiar
area
of
massachusetts
so
to
speak
of
claiming
an
appeal?
does
that
mean
the
same
time
as
you
file
a
notice
of
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
what
are
the
collateral
consequences
your
friend
was
discussing?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
took
the
case
there?
by
definition
didn't
he?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
that
case?
what
is
that
case?
is
that
in
your
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
this
brief.
this
brief
--
it's
on
the
brief
of
the
appellant
on
page
5
and
he
shows
why
that's
inadequate
for
him?
justice
potter
stewart
what
procedure
was
followed
in
whitmarsh?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
whitmarsh
the
critical
case
here?
it
has
to
be
in
your
posture
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
it's
here
before
us,
whitmarsh
has
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
whitmarsh
is
too.
there
is
a
petition
for
certiorari
here
that
hasn't
been
acted
on.
justice
potter
stewart
let
me
repeat
my
first
question,
are
you
not
relying
on
what
you
call
your
supreme
judicial
court?
didn't
whitmarsh
do
what
was
your
posture
here
without
its
opinion
in
whitmarsh,
wouldn't
you
be
in
a
much
weaker
posture?
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
to
costarelli's
case
in
jurisdiction,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
why
don't
you
just
answer
that
there
is
more
than
that
--
there
is
more
than
review
of
the
record.
there
is
a
way
of
having
the
judgment
entirely
automatically
wiped
out.
we
settled
that.
why
does
that
require
anything
--
any
problem
with
largent?
justice
potter
stewart
then
it
can
be
more
than
complied
with.
the
state
not
only
gives
a
review,
it
entirely
gives
a
procedure
whereby
they
don't
care
whether
it's
on
the
record
it's
valid
or
not.
we'll
just
get
rid
of
it
and
start
over.
justice
potter
stewart
it
hasn't
been
circulated.
