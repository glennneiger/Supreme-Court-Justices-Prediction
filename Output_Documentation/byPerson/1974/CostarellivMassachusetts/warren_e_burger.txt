chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-6739,
costarelli
against
massachusetts.
mr.
hagopian,
i
think
you
may
proceed
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wait
a
minute,
is
this
being
found
innocent
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
mr.
justice
white
asked
you
suppose
you're
found
innocent
in
the
superior
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don't
suggest
i
take
it
that
--
this
is
a
subjective
question.
if
he's
tried
in
this
first
tribunal
with
a
jury,
found
guilty,
“takes
an
appeal”
but
gets
a
trial
de
novo,
any
problems
about
that
in
terms
of
double
jeopardy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
the
state
did
give
the
jury
trial
in
the
first
instance,
all
they'd
need
to
do
is
have
a
review
on
the
record
if
they
provided
any
review
at
all,
is
that
possible?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mills.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
are
the
circumstances
in
which
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
massachusetts
could
take
the
case
directly
from
the
district
court
to
said
in
passing
under
some
circumstances,
is
it
a
certiorari
jurisdiction
or
a
certiorari
before
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
your
position,
would
at
least
acceptance
of
your
position
here,
would
at
least
require
the
court
to
modify
or
explain
some
of
the
language
in
largent
at
the
very
least.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
be
able
to
agree
with
that
would
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
largent
said
that
if
there's
no
review
on
the
record
in
any
other
state
tribunal,
then
it's
final
for
purposes
of
coming
here
isn't
that
basically
what
it
said?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
this
case,
there
is
no
review
on
the
record
in
any
other
court
of
massachusetts.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
a
district
or
boston
municipal
court
proceeding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
hagopian?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
wondering
there
was
just
--
mr.
mills
just
referred
to
an
amicus
brief
and
i
don't
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
respond
to
it
and
your
friend
may
comment
on
the
response
if
you
wish
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
want,
five
days,
seven
days,10
days?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
submit
a
typewritten
form
if
you
like
in
response.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you're
not
going
to
file
an
extensive
brief.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you.

warren
e.
burger
