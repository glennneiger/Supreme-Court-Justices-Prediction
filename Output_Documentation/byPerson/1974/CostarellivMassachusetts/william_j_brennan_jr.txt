justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hagopian,
what
if
your
client
had
been
initially
tried
in
the
district
court
on
the
same
charge
he
wasn't
acquitted
and
then
he
was
tried
again
in
the
district
court
and
found
guilty
and
you
wanted
to
raise
the
claim
of
double
jeopardy.
could
you
raise
that
in
the
superior
court
on
an
appeal
from
that
second
verdict?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
why
can't
you
raise
your
jury
trial
claim
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
you
could
have
i
suppose
under
those
circumstances
after
making
your
point
in
the
superior
court
claiming
the
right
to
jury
trial,
they
rule
against
you,
at
least
brought
it
here
from
the
superior
court
on
the
ruling
on
that
motion
rather
than
just
from
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
your
answer
to
my
question
is
right,
he
wouldn't
have
had
to
suffer
a
second
trial.
he
could've
gotten
a
ruling
on
his
motion
in
the
superior
court
and
before
he
ever
went
to
trial
in
the
superior
court
could've
brought
it
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you're
saying
then
is
that,
although
he
can
appeal
from
the
final
judgment
of
district
court,
had
he
taken
the
state
proceedings
a
step
further,
gone
into
the
superior
court
and
made
his
motion,
he
couldn't
appeal
from
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
pending
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
go
up
on
the
record
and
made
in
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
goes
up
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
on
your
motion
for
extraordinary
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
complaint
is
just
like
a
complaint
in
a
trial
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
like
a
writ
of
prohibition
or
mandamus.
you
allege
what
you
claim
going
down
the
road.
