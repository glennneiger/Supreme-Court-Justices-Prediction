justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
very
much
like
an
appeal
in
that
sense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mills,
what
do
you
understand
his
federal
constitutional
issue
is
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
saying
then
that
you
would
make
the
same
argument
in
the
massachusetts
court
of
appeals
that
he
is
making
here
now
on
the
merits?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
that
it
would
be
open
to
it
anyway.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wasn't
there
too
--
in
largent
too
though,
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
largent?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
what
you're
contending
for
might
leave
open
the
possibility
that
if
a
defendant
could
get
review
on
writ
of
prohibition
or
writ
of
mandamus.
the
kind
of
thing
where
you
file
an
original
complaint,
don't
bring
the
record
up
so
long
as
he
could
review
some
aspect
of
the
proceedings
in
a
higher
court
even
though
it's
by
an
original
action.
the
lower
court's
proceedings
wouldn't
be
final.
that
would
be
a
very
significant
departure
from
largent.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it's
mooted
in
the
massachusetts
courts,
why
isn't
it
mooted
here
and
if
it's
not
mooted
here,
why
is
it
mooted
in
the
massachusetts
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
if
he
hadn't
stayed
them,
then
you
have
no
case
here.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
largent,
the
state
proceeding
left
the
judgment
final
and
in
effect
and
here
you
have
a
very
ready
remedy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
like
saying
supposing
you
don't
appeal
from
the
superior
court
of
massachusetts
to
the
supreme
court,
you've
got
to.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
a
certain
irony
in
your
case
and
in
your
opponent's
case
because
the
more
you
make
the
thing
look
like
an
appeal,
the
worse
of
you
are
in
the
jurisdictional
basis
but
the
better
off
you
are
in
the
constitutional
merits.
the
same
is
true
in
reverse
of
your
opponent's
case.
the
more
he
can
make
the
second
proceeding
look
like
an
appeal,
the
better
he
looks
jurisdictionally
but
the
worse
it
looks
on
the
merit.
