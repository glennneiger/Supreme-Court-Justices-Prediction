justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
he
ever
raise
that
up
through
the
massachusetts
system?
he's
found
guilty
in
the
municipal
court,
he
claims
an
appeal
and
how
does
he
present
to
the
superior
court
his
claim
that
having
to
go
through
the
municipal
court
is
a
burden
on
his
jury
trial
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
again,
how
does
he
bring
this
to
the
--
before
the
superior
court.
if
he
claims
--
if
he's
tried
there
and
found
innocent,
the
case
if
over?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he's
tried
there
with
a
jury
and
found
guilty,
then
what
does
he
claim
in
the
superior?
how
can
he
present
that
to
the
superior
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
when
he's
convicted
in
the
massa
--
in
the
superior
court,
he
then
appeals
and
says,
this
conviction
is
invalid
because
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
will
he
say
if
say,
he's
found
guilty
after
jury
trial
in
superior
court?
now
and
what
does
he
say
to
the
massachusetts
court
of
appeals
or
to
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court?
what
does
he
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
state
comes
back
as
it
is
but
now
you've
been
given
a
jury
trial,
you've
been
found
guilty,
you're
just
claiming
an
error
for
which
there
is
no
remedy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let's
assume
that
that
procedure
just
weren't
open
in
the
massachusetts
courts.
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
conclude
that
his
federal
issue
had
been
finally
decided
in
the
state
courts,
by
every
court
that
would
decide
it.
let's
--
i
would
suppose
that
if
you'
were
right,
if
that
kind
of
motion
is
open
in
the
superior
court
and
can
be
taken
up
through
the
state
courts,
you've
got
something
to
your
finality
--
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
that
is
right,
i
don't
think
you
may
not
have
much
to
your
finality,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
suggestion
is
--
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
have
any
way
of
sending
this
back
to
anybody
to
find
out
whether
you
or
your
adversary
are
right,
have
we?
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
whitmarsh.
this
comes
directly
here
from
the
district
court,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
have
you
have
an
intervening
--
as
i
understand
it,
whitmarsh
has
been
decided
since
this
judgment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
important.
you
say
that
they
would
be
open
to
it
at
least
or
it
wouldn't
be
open.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
yes,
we're
the
ones
to
decide
finality.
