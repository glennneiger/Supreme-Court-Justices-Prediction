mr.
joseph
h.
darago
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellant
francis
f.
doran
sued
here
in
as
frank
doran
is
the
town
attorney
of
the
town
north
hempstead.
he
is
the
chief
legal
officer
of
the
town
and
the
chief
adviser
to
its
legislature
the
town
board
made
up
of
four
town
councilman
and
a
supervisor.
the
town
north
hempstead
is
located
in
northwest
national
county
and
borders
on
the
city
of
new
york,
queens
county
that
has
a
total
population
of
242,000
plus
or
minus
and
is
made
up
of
incorporated
villages
and
unincorporated
areas
over
which
the
town
board
exercises
its
jurisdiction.
the
appellees
in
this
case
are
owners
and
operators
of
certain
establishments
that
sell
liquor,
bars
as
we
would
commonly
call
them,
and
they
provide
a
form
of
entertainment
which
we
referred
to
in
everyday
life
as
topless
dancing.
on
july
10th
1973,
the
town
board
of
the
town
of
north
hempstead
undertook
to
enact
the
piece
of
legislation
known
as
local
law
no.
1
of
1973.
local
law
no.
1
of
1973
became
effective
by
filing
with
the
secretary
of
state
of
new
york
on
july
17th
1973
and
simply
stated
it
prohibited
topless
dancing.
on
august
9th,
the
appellees
in
this
case
commenced
an
action
in
the
federal
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
new
york
charging
local
law
no.
1
as
being
unconstitutional.
on
september
26,
1973,
by
a
decision
of
the
honorable
john
r.
bartels
of
the
district
court,
the
statute
in
question
was
held
unconstitutional.
the
appellant
appealed
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
of
the
united
states
for
the
second
circuit
and
that
the
decision
of
judge
bartels
was
affirmed
by
a
2-1
decision
on
june
26,
1974.
basically,
the
challenge
to
the
ordinance
and
the
decision
of
each
court
below,
was
based
on
the
doctrine
that
in
cases
where
first
amendment
rights
are
concerned.
an
examination
of
a
statute
on
its
phase
and
a
determination
after
that
examination
that
the
statute
is
overbroad
will
make
that
statute
fall.
we
submit
that
in
this
case
that
doctrine
of
overbreadth
should
not
have
been
applied.
the
statute
itself,
the
text
of
which
is
set
forth
in
the
brief
on
page
--
beginning
on
page
3
provides
in
section
1.0
that
the
town
board
undertook
to
regulate
and
control
the
operations
of
public
places
used
as
cabarets,
bars,
or
lounges,
dance
halls,
and
discotheques,
and
other
public
places
in
general.
it
defines
public
place
in
the
section,
it
defines
cabarets,
bars,
lounges
and
discotheques
and
dance
halls
and
that
defines
the
person.
it
then
makes
it
unlawful
to
appear
with
one's
breast
uncovered
if
you're
a
female,
once
lower
torso,
if
you're
a
male,
and
both
the
breast
and
the
lower
torso
if
you're
a
female.
in
this
next
section,
it
also
makes
it
unlawful
to
promote
the
same
that
is
to
present
it
as
a
bar
owner.
traditionally,
the
police
powers
of
the
community
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
operation
of
local
governments
such
as
the
town
of
hempstead.
just
recently
in
the
village
of
boraas
against
the
village
of
belle
terre
this
court
upheld
a
zoning
provision
allowing
a
locality
such
as
the
town
of
north
hempstead,
in
that
case,
the
village
of
belle
terre
to
define
and
enforce
the
definition
of
family
for
the
purposes
of
occupancy
of
dwellings.
it
is
under
these
police
powers,
that
the
town
of
north
hempstead
undertook
to
cutoff
at
the
source
the
basic
and
originating
problem
or
originating
problem
of
certain
complaints
that
had
received
concerning
the
operation
of
appellees
establishments
and
establishments
which
are
owned
and
operated
by
peoples
not
parties
for
this
action.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
yes.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
is
correct,
all
alcoholic
beverages
--
all
of
the
appellees
serve
alcoholic
beverages.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
it
is
possible
that
the
ordinance
could
be
read
that
if
no
alcoholic
beverages
were
served
in
a
cabaret,
which
is
the
most
unlikely
i
would
think
that
it
would
cover
a
cabaret,
yes
sir,
or
a
dance
hall
or
a
discotheque
or
an
establishment
of
that
nature,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
mr.
justice
marshall,
no.
they
have
been
in
contact
with
us
but
they
have
not
--
well
they
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
licensing
of
bars,
yes
that
is
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
and
they've
taken
no
action
to
my
knowledge.
the
public
record
of
the
public
hearing
held
will
demonstrate
the
types
of
complaints
that
the
town
board
received.
similarly,
the
town
of
north
hempstead
town
board
recognized
that
one
or
more
of
these
establishments
were
within
a
hundred
feet
of
residential
areas
that
peoples
who
owned
the
residence
within
a
hundred
feet
of
these
areas
had
made
specific
complaints
about
conduct
of
patrons,
litter,
noise,
and
things
similarly
important
to
the
town
in
enforcing
and
keeping
this
suburban
community,
the
town
of
north
hempstead
a
nice
suburban
community.
this
concern
we
submit
is
the
basis
of
at
least
some
compelling
governmental
interest.
this
compelling
governmental
interest
is
a
relative
term.
what
is
compelling
for
the
united
states
as
a
whole
may
be
a
separate
and
distinct
item
as
to
what
is
concern
--
the
concern
of
a
local
community
of
240,000
people.
one
compared
that
the
other,
one
may
look
very
great
and
the
other
de
minimis.
wherein
the
town
such
as
ours
who
--
which
faces
the
everyday
problems
of
living,
noise,
litter,
patron's
conduct
around
bars
and
incidentally,
i
might
say
that
the
record
would
justify
the
statement
that
on
bars
that
didn't
provide
topless
dancing,
none
of
these
complaints
were
ever
voiced
before
the
town
board.
that
the
town
board
acted
in
a
manner
in
which
it
thought
would
best
remedy
to
the
problems
arisen.
unfortunately,
after
the
enactment,
judge
bartels
found
that
the
statute
and
used
the
words
from
thornhill
against
alabama
by
its
wordings
swept
into
areas
of
otherwise
protected
expression,
we
debate
that.
topless
dancing
is
conduct.
it
has
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
containing
a
minimal
of
expression
and
even
assuming
if
any
expression
is
there,
it's
still
constitutes
conduct.
one
of
the
most
striking
facts
about
this
court's
first
amendment
opinions
is
their
are
absolute
consistency
that
under
a
challenge
to
the
first
amendment,
the
doctrine
of
overbreadth
will
be
reserved
to
spoken
words,
freedom
of
expression,
freedom
to
communicate
one's
ideas,
freedom
to
gather
and
assemble
peaceably
to
do
just
that
express
and
communicate
one's
ideas.
secondly,
important
in
this
case
is
the
appellees
here
assert
the
rights
of
others
and
not
of
their
own.
in
this
case,
the
appellees,
and
i'm
referring
at
this
moment
to
the
appendix
page
9
beginning
with
paragraph
16
of
the
complaint,
“the
law
deprives
the
patrons
of
the
plaintiffs'
bars
of
the
right
to
view
constitutionally
protected
expression.
the
law
on
its
face
and
as
applied
to
the
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights
as
so
discretionary
and
vague
and
overbroad
the
void
of
objective
guidelines
as
to
restrain
and
chill
the
exercise
of
such
rights.”
it
bears
no
relation
to
a
governmental
purpose,
violates
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
it
is
interesting
that
the
plaintiffs
have
not
risen
a
--
excuse
me
--
have
not
brought
up
the
subjects
of
their
right
to
present
this
type
of
entertainment
but
of
their
right
of
their
patrons
to
view
the
same.
if
this
has
any
element
of
expression,
this
topless
dancing,
it
is
further
reduced
by
the
fact
that
what
the
plaintiffs
really
are
doing
are
commercionally
exploiting
nudity.
they
haven't
got
a
topless
dancer
or
a
naked
dancer
as
they
have
now
on
the
stage
to
express
an
idea,
they've
got
a
naked
dancer
on
the
stage
to
draw
a
patron
into
their
establishments
and
to
selling
drinks.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
their
complaint
although
it
has
the
magic
words
in
it,
chill,
freedom
of
expression,
belies
the
fact
because
they
claim
irreparable
damage
because
when
they
don't
have
naked
dancing,
they
lose
money.
the
ultimate
facts
that
they've
plead
speak
otherwise
than
to
their
claim
that
what
they
do
is
first
--
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
we
submit
that
so
minimal
if
there
is
any
expression
in
topless
dancing
is
this
expression
that
it
constitutes
conduct
validly
regulatable
by
the
state.
public
nudity
--
public
nudity,
nudity
in
public
was
a
crime
at
the
criminal
law
or
at
common
law.
this
is
something
that
the
state
has
the
power
to
regulate.
certainly,
the
state
can
make
a
law
preventing
nudity
on
the
streets.
under
the
police
powers,
they
can
make
this
law
and
enforce
it.
similarly
in
a
public
place
for
the
good
of
the
community,
they
can
prevent
exactly
what
we
have
going
on
in
north
hempstead
now,
topless
dancing.
in
california
against
larue,
this
court
recognized
the
minimal
amount
of
expression
in
topless
dancing.
eight
or
nine
jurisdictions
in
this
united
states
has
reduced
that
expressive
contain
even
further
under
this
commercial
exploitation
of
nudity
idea.
in
as
much
as
topless
dancing
is
conduct
and
not
spoken
words
or
pure
speech,
the
doctrine
of
overbreadth
does
not
apply.
similarly,
the
appellees
contention
that
would
prevent
the
theatrical
performance
cannot
be
raised.
in
california
against
larue,
this
court
clearly
indicated
that
it
would
be
unwise
or
do
what
the
service
to
the
ballet
to
compare
a
ballet
dancer
to
that
of
a
topless
dancer
in
a
bar.
similarly,
the
likelihood
that
any
appellee
here
would
have
in
their
establishments
which
are
small,
local,
community
bars
the
desire
or
even
the
facilities
that
put
on
a
theatrical
performance
such
as
hair
or
the
ballet
just
can't
be
conceived.
i'm
sure
that
legislature
of
the
town
board
considered
the
likelihood
and
the
possibility
of
this.
similarly,
it
may
well
be
that
should
the
appellees
undertake
to
place
a
production
such
as
hair
or
in
their
bar,
they
might
be
violating
some
other
zoning
ordinance.
basically,
it
comes
down
to
the
rationale
of
this
court
in
its
recent
case
of
broadrick
against
oklahoma.
this
statute
with
a
fair
reading
of
the
words
clearly
shows
that
it
applies
for
the
appellees
here.
there
within
that
hardcore
conduct
which
this
statute
was
meant
to
prevent,
topless
dancing;
they
vicariously
assert
the
rights
of
others
to
perform
the
ballet
and
to
put
on
hair.
this
vicarious
assertion
of
rights
even
if
it
were
in
the
area
of
political
freedom,
the
right
to
participate
in
politics
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
no
basis
for
declaring
a
statute
overbroad.
we
submit
to
you
that
topless
dancing
has
been
properly
excluded
and
that
courts
below
errored
in
approaching
these
topless
dancers
and
this
statute
as
if
it
barred
free
speech,
as
if
it
barred
communication,
as
if
it
barred
the
right
to
express
your
ideas.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
yes
it
was,
justice
white,
it
was
declared
unconstitutional.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
in
the
district
court
by
john
bartels.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
similarly,
in
the
court
of
appeals
it
was
held
unconstitutionally
overbroad
and
its
enforcement
was
enjoined.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
that's
true,
mr.
justice
white,
however
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
rule
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
the
judgment
is
--
the
injunction
is
as
permanent
as
can
be.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i
believe
it
did.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i
believe
it
did.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
it
did
affirm
the
judgment
but
in
affect
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
may
i
give
the
court's
attention
to
the
second
ordinance
that
the
town
tried
to
pass.
after
rendering
a
similar
decision,
judge
bartels
upon
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
converted
it
to
a
final
judgment
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
this
preliminary
injunction
could
be
rendered
final
by
the
sweep
of
a
pen
or
judge
bartels'
order,
it
was
not
further
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
well,
that
was
the
trust
of
judge
lumbard's
dissent
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
and
i
believe
so
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
on
its
face,
facially
overbroad
under
thornhill
against
alabama
that
it
could
sweep
into
another
area,
for
example,
the
specific
example
they
used
being
theatrical
performances
in
the
ballet.
i
think
also
that
this
case
is
a
hybrid
had
not
the
district
court
determined
the
existence
of
possible
overbreadth.
they
may
well
have
abstained
after
not
determining
or
finding
that
this
was
conduct
under
which
the
decisions
of
this
court
do
not
render
the
overbreadth
doctrine
applicable.
i
think
that
the
federal
court
ignored
committee
which
would
be
their
respect
for
the
lower
state
courts
to
do
justice
to
constitutional
claims
and
i
think
more
importantly
below
they
ignored
equity.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i'm
talking
about
both
of
them
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
that's
what
i
meant
by
this
case
being
a
hybrid.
i
think
that
comedy
is
something
that
the
federal
court
misread
in
the
decision
of
steffel
that
the
federal
courts
are
a
powerful
defender
of
constitutional
rights
and
the
rush
to
the
courthouse
rule
created
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
overlooks
that
the
state
courts
in
which
we
all
practice
everyday
are
just
as
capable
to
handle
a
constitutional
claim
as
are
the
federal
courts.
and
had
they
not
determine
and
i
submit
erroneously
that
this
was
a
free
speech
or
spoken
words
case
or
overbreadth
case,
they
probably
would
have
abstained
and
send
it
back
for
prosecutions.
and
incidentally,
the
prosecutions
were
called
on
the
calendar
of
the
local
district
court
prior
to
any
decision
by
judge
bartels
and
that
therefore
these
people
had
been
arraigned
and
were
ready
for
trial.
we
were
ready
for
trial
before
any
preliminary
injunction
was
issued.
similarly,
i
think
that
the
equity
of
one
of
the
plaintiffs
here
intentionally
violating
the
statute
as
something
that
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
your
concurring
opinion
in
steffel
against
thompson
that
even
though
a
federal
court
decides
to
hear
this
case
and
render
its
decision,
it
does
not
protect
the
plaintiff
from
intentional
violations
of
the
ordinance
without
threatening
the
laws
of
his
federal
case
for
dismissal.
i
think
younger
against
harris
made
that
clear
as
well
that
at
any
time,
if
the
facts
wanted,
this
court
--
the
federal
courts
could
remand
this
cases
to
state
prosecutions.
i
think
this
is
an
important
idea
and
i
think
this
is
the
very
case
that
steffel
contemplated
and
that
younger
contemplated.
there's
nothing
noble
about
what
we
call
post
facto
abstention
where
equity
warrants
the
same.
and
in
this
case,
we
have
one
of
the
plaintiffs
to
admit
the
lead
do
not
violate
it.
but
one
of
the
plaintiffs
did
and
there
was
a
kind
of
a
privity
between
the
plaintiffs
here.
if
not
that
the
jury
privity
but
in
fact
a
factual
privity
that
this
people
are
altogether,
they're
common
owners,
they
watch
each
others
stores
so
to
speak
when
one
is
out
and
one
is
in,
and
the
privity
is
so
close
that
all
the
issues
of
this
case.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
no,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
was
a
factual
privity
that
these
three
people
got
together
to
challenge
this
ordinance,
they
had
one
attorney,
they
brought
one
action
under
the
civil
rights
law
and
as
such
when
one
of
them
undertook
to
violate
the
ordinance,
the
district
court
should've
examine
that
closely
and
said,
“well,
you've
made
your
own
bed
now
back
to
the
state
courts
which
can
remedy
your
constitutional
claims
as
well
as
we
can.”
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i
don't
suggest
that
that
is,
that
there
is
anything
unusual
about
it.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
did.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
raise
the
footnote
which
is
number
four
--
footnote
4,
i
can't
recall
what
page
on
which
it
is,
which
almost
clearly
outlines
the
very
same
thing
that
this
court
held
in
younger
and
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
there
was
a
footnote
in
younger
against
harris
explaining
the
applicability
of
overbreadth.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i
raised
it,
yes.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
yes,
your
honor,
i
did.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
they
brought
an
action
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
they
brought
it
on
the
seventh,
i'm
sorry,
on
the
8th
day
of
--
9th
day
of
august
1973
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
they
ask
for
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
the
same
was
denied
by
judge
dooling.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
the
day
after
he
denied
that,
one
plaintiff
m
&
l
rest
began
to
violate
the
ordinance
and
on
the
10th
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
resenting
topless
dancing.
they
had
complied
--
the
bar
owners
had
complied
with
the
ordinance
between
the
17th
when
it
became
effective
and
the
9th
when
they
brought
this
federal
action.
on
the
10th
after
the
tro
was
denied
and
after
this
action
was
--
after
the
action
was
commenced
in
fact,
m
&
l
rest
began
to
present
topless
dancing.
the
police
came
down,
issued
summonses
to
dancers,
owners,
and
a
prosecution
was
in
fact
begun.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
on
the
10th
of
august
1973.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
the
arrests
right.
the
following
day
they
were
arraigned.
informations
were
filled
out,
we
have
an
information
system,
a
uniformed
system
of
a
simplified
criminal
complaints.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
no,
that
is
not
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
they
were
not
being
prosecuted.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
they
did
comply.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
and
incidentally
they
complied
right
through
judge
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
--
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
that
in
this
case,
this
factual
privity
of
which
i
spoke
before
rendered
each
of
them
the
issues
that
they
claim
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
with
the
same
ordinance
and
they
all
had
the
same
attorney
and
mr.
justice
brennan,
had
they
waited
they
would've
had
the
issues
disposed
off
in
our
local
district
court,
which
is
our
lowest
court
of
criminal
jurisdiction,
by
the
time
judge
bartels
had
rendered
his
decision.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
well,
no
arrests
were
made,
they
had
been
issued
summonses
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
then
they
would
have
the
opportunity
to
go
through
our
appellate
system
or
for
that
matter.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i
think
that
once
there
was
no
appeal
taken,
the
law
of
this
situation
would
have
been
decided.
we
would
have
a
narrow
in
court
decision
of
this
ordinance
or
this
local
law
which
would
give
the
proper
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
the
district
court
of
nassau
county.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i
would
say
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
no.
it's
higher
than
a
local
magistrate's
court
but
not
quite
as
high
as
a
court
of
original
civil
jurisdiction
like
our
supreme
court.
i
would
say
that
once
that
case
had
been
interpreted
by
the
court
in
the
case
of
m
&
l
rest,
then
the
other
plaintiffs
would
have
something
to
bring
to
the
federal
court
because
there
would
be
a
narrowly
construction
to
review.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
well,
once
again
we
assume
that
their
constitutional
objection
under
the
first
amendment
will
be
reviewed
by
the
district
court.
they've
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
no
more
threat
than
under
the
enforcement
that
if
i
speed,
i'm
going
to
get
a
ticket,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
absolutely
and
he
had
absolute
right
but
once
again,
in
steffel,
he
was
handbilling,
he
was
expressing
ideas,
he
was
communicating.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
he
wasn't
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
no,
he
had
stopped
because
he
showed
eminent
threat
of
arrest
under
what
he
in
turn
to
be
an
overbroad
statute.
but
once
again
it
was
free
speech.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i
think
so
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
as
much
as
they're
presenting
topless
dancing
which
is
conduct
and
not
some
form
of
communication
like
mr.
steffel
or
mr.
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
absolutely
and
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
as
overbroad
is
what
they
said
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
absolutely.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
and
absolutely
--
a
proper
case
for
which
this
court's
decision
on
overbreadth
could
be
applied,
the
right
to
pass
out
literature
to
express
oneself.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
that
is
true.
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
h.
darago
i
don't
think
that
the
first
amendment
claim
is
valid
in
that
misconduct
of
topless
dancing
contains
such
minimal
amounts
of
discretion
under
u.s.
against
o'brien
and
cases
of
that
sort.
we
properly
as
to
the
town
of
north
hempstead
prohibited
this
kind
of
activity
within
the
town
boundaries.
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
couple
of
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
possible.
