justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
ordinance
declared
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
in
this
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
only
a
preliminary
injunction
at
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
there
some
room
at
the
federal
courts
that
you
don't
make
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
and
the
issuing
of
preliminary
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
the
preliminary
injunction
was
affirmed.
but
that
could've
been
merely
on
the
chances
of
prevailing
on
the
merits
plus
irreparable
injury.
and
i
know
the
district
court
said
these
statutes
unconstitutional.
would
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
statute
was
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
ordinance?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it
affirmed
the
judgment
--
justice
byron
r.
white
which
means
merely
leaving
the
preliminary
injunction
on
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how'd
they
finally
go
in
jail.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
regulating
liquor
is
just
saying
there
won't
be
any
nude
dancing
in
bars.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
let's
assume
they
did.
they
had
a
local
ordinance
so
there
shall
be
no
nude
dancing
in
any
place
for
liquors
so
is
that
what
you
say
--
that's
not
within
the
power
of
municipality?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
you're
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
denied.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
federal
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
difference
you
have
now
have
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
that
criminal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
get
that
from
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
terms
of
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
a
preliminary
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
against
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
anybody
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
far
as
you
know,
having
you
got
the
injunction,
where
is
the
injunction.
is
it
in
the
appendix?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
ordinance
is
primary
declared
was
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
declared
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
was
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
--
you
can
--
the
district
court
of
appeals
maybe
narrow
in
planning
and
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
is
your
right
on
the
probability
of
--
on
eight
probabilities
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll
follow
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
state
is
pretty
(inaudible)
there,
if
he'd
understood
that
if
it
did
not
enforced
this
ordinance
against
anybody
because
of
the
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
with
that
as
precisely
what
mayo
against
herington
in
this
court
was
designed
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
declared
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
well
didn't
enter
an
injunction
against
every
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
more
important
what
you
declared
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
most
of
the
prosecutors
until
it's
finally
settled
which
i
will
work
on
of
course
you
are
against
anybody.
they
aren't
forcing
it
against
anybody
in
this
--
i
don't
know
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
probably,
(inaudible)
said,
the
district
court
said
that
he
probably
use
the
sense
at
zero.
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
could
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
thinks
that's
--
do
you
think
that's
true
even
though
a
tro
is
denied
and
even
though
that
the
substantial
issue
about
the
preliminary
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
state
suppose
to
do,
(inaudible)
rush
to
the
federal
court
for
enforcing
its
federal
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
my
question
is
what
do
you
suppose
--
the
state
prosecutor
supposed
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
he
files
federal
complaint,
he
supposed
to
put
enforce
and
laws,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
talking
about
this
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
you
--
i
am
understanding
your
point,
what
about
your
point.
we'll
just
give
way
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
adjudicate
it
--
what
would
he
had
done
at
the
preliminary
injunction
has
been
denied.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
prosecutor
suppose
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
final
adjudication?
