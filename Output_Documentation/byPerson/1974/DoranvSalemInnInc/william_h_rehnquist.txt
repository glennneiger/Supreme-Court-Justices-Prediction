rehnquist
did
each
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
serve
alcoholic
beverages
on
the
premises?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ordinance
by
its
terms
though
would've
covered
people
who
did.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
comedy,
are
you
talking
about
just
abstention
for
a
construction
of
the
state
law
or
are
you
talking
about
younger
against
harris
and
steffel
and
those
cases,
are
talking
about
both
of
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
privity
and
that's
as
are
you're
speaking
about
it
in
any
sense
recognized
in
the
law
that
is
that
there
are
common
owners
of
this
three
people.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
there's
nothing
unusual
on
a
bunch
of
caf√©
owners
or
bar
owners
getting
together
to
consult
about
in
ordinance
that
affects
all
of
them.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kassner,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
your
claim
is
basically
one
of
overbreadth
that
is
that
new
york
could
have
prohibited
these
particular
performances
in
institutions
serving
liquor
had
it
drawn
an
ordinance
to
that
effect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
the
state
liquor
authority
but
you
went
into
federal
court
to
challenge
this
provision.
we
don't
know
whether
new
york,
we
know
that
new
york
has
this
power
under
the
twenty-first
amendment,
we
don't
know
whether
it
resides
in
the
state
liquor
authority
or
whether
it's
delegated
at
the
town
of
hempstead.
i
think
you
pretty
well
have
waived
that
by
failing
to
litigate
that
in
the
state
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
the
district
court
at
the
top
of
page
23(a)
says
in
conclusion,
we
find
that
local
law
no.
1-1973,
the
town
of
hempstead
is
on
its
phase
violative
of
plaintiff's
first
amendment
rights,
that's
no
suggestion
that
they
may,
will
very
well
succeed,
that's
a
flat
statement.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
his--but
what
judge
oakes
says
is
we
agree
with
the
district
court
as
to
the
probability
of
success
on
the
merits.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
more
would
--
what
more
remained
to
be
done
before
judge
bartels
after
his
order
of
september
6?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
he
says
therefore
pending
the
final
determination
of
this
action
but
what
more
remained
to
be
done
after
he
had
found
the
ordinance
unconstitutional
on
its
phase.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
all
pro
forma
after
this
determination,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
nobody
did
anything
after
the
order
of
september
6?
then
it
simply
remains
in
status
quo
idea.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
nothing
is
done,
judge
bartels'
temporary
injunction
remains
in
effect
these
town
as
enjoined
and
it
can
go
on
that
way
i
take
for
20
years.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
respondents
in
this
case
which
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
are
three
corporations
which
operate
bars
in
north
hempstead,
new
york.
for
a
number
of
years
they
each
entertained
their
customers
by
presenting
topless
dancing.
but
in
1973,
the
town
of
north
hempstead
enacted
an
ordinance
forbidding
anyone
from
permitting
any
female
to
appear
in
any
public
place
with
uncovered
breasts.
all
three
of
these
respondents
initially
complied
with
the
ordinance
but
they
also
brought
suit
in
federal
court.
and
their
complaint
there
alleged
that
the
ordinance
infringed
their
constitutional
rights
to
free
expression.
immediately
after
the
federal
complaint
was
filed
and
before
any
decision
in
that
case,
one
of
these
respondents,
m
&
l
restaurant
renewed
its
presentation
of
topless
dancing
and
as
a
result
of
this,
the
state
criminal
proceedings
were
commenced
against
it
and
some
of
its
dancers.
the
federal
district
court
later
granted
a
preliminary
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
local
ordinance
on
behalf
of
all
three
bars
despite
the
restrictions
on
federal
interference
with
state
criminal
proceedings
which
we
set
forth
in
the
case
of
younger
against
harris.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
the
issuance
of
the
preliminary
injunction
as
to
all
three
of
the
bars.
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part.
we
hold
that
m
&
l
which
went
ahead
and
violated
the
ordinance
may
not
obtain
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief
unless
it
can
satisfy
the
standards
set
forth
in
younger.
so
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
as
to
m
&
l.
as
to
the
other
two
respondents
who
did
not
violate
the
state
ordinance
and
who
therefore
had
no
state
criminal
prosecutions
pending
against
them
when
they
brought
their
federal
action,
we
hold
they
may
obtain
federal
adjudication
of
their
rights.
because
the
lower
courts
did
nothing
more
than
grant
preliminary
relief
we
did
not
--
we
need
not
decide
whether
respondents
are
entitled
to
prevail
on
the
merits
of
their
first
amendment
contentions,
we
merely
decided
in
the
light
of
existing
case
law
and
of
the
broad
reach
of
north
hempstead's
ordinance
which
extends
far
beyond
the
control
of
topless
dancing
in
establishments
serving
alcoholic
beverage
and
of
the
possibility
that
respondents
would
suffer
bankruptcy
were
the
ordinance
enforced
while
their
rights
were
being
litigated.
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
issuing
a
preliminary
injunction
in
their
behalf.
we
therefore
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
