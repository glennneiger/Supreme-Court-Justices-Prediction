justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you're
right
the
criminal
proceeding
i
gather,
it
was
the
day
after
the
federal
suit
started,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
quite
assuming
even
though
--
even
in
that
circumstance
that
the
younger
rules
apply,
that
wouldn't
be
too
as
to
salem
inn
and
tim-rob
bar,
would
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
to
say
they
were
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
or
even
threatened
to,
because
i
gather
they
came
with
the
compliance,
didn't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that's
so,
i
gather
was
it
wrong
then
in
--
of
the
federal
court
to
reach
these
questions
in
those
two
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
they
were
all
in
the
same
business
and
they
were
all
bothered
with
the
same
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
tim-rob
--
if
m
&
l
rest
would
lowest
doubt
in
the
district
court,
they
still
want
to
go
ahead.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
tim-rob
was
or
m
&
l
wasn't
interested
in
appealing
your
appellate
system
because
they
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
they
had
a
conviction.
what
is
your
local
court,
what
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
what's
its
equivalent?
is
that
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
like
a
local
magistrate
or?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
that
could
run
to
a
threat
of
enforcement
anyway,
weren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know
with
much
as
steffel
was
in
steffel
case
of
the
criminal
prosecution
was
pending
against
someone
else
not
against
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
he
wasn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
when
the
was
suit
brought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
these
two
bars
on
any
different
position
than
he
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
steffel
wasn't
handbilling
either.
he
run
into
federal
court
and
said,
“i'm
entitled
to
hand
do
but
i'm
not
going
because
i
don't
want
to
be
prosecuted
as
i've
been
threatened.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
soon
people
said
i'm
in
federal
court
because
we
want
to
attach
our
ordinates.
meanwhile,
we're
going
to
come
into
compliance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
they
did,
that's
what
they
came
into.
that's
why
they
came
into
compliance.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
much
difference
in
stuff
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
get
the
request
mr.
kassner
whether
in
any
event
this
court
should've
proceeded
with
the
suit
libel
tendency
before
its
judgment
of
criminal
prosecution
against
one
of
these
three
bars?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
question
is
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
maybe
right
at
everything
but
wouldn't
be
immaterial
i
think
if
both
the
district
court
shouldn't
have
preceded
with
the
suit.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
abstention,
how
do
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
abstention.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
alright.
i
don't
blame
you,
i
don't
know
that
any
of
us
knows.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
i
understand
that
the
criminal
prosecution
followed
by
a
day
in
the
following
in
the
filing
of
the
federal
complaint?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
an
injunction
which
has
stop
criminal
proceeding,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
state
didn't
proceed
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
now
they
can't
without
violating
any
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
at
the
top
of
page
23(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
was
that
about
16
to
17
lines
history
for
the
citation
to
burn,
what
about
that
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
furthermore,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
affirmants
do
not
include
what
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
read
to
you,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
your
suggestion
mr.
kassner,
judge
oakes
at
least
was
conscious
of
the
problem
raised
by
mayo
was
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
did
side
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
he
did,
why
did
he
write
as
is
to
the
court
in
which
it
would
have
to
fall?
that's
a
little
inconsistent,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
least
the
issue
would
be
clearer
if
he
had
not
used
that
sentence,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
any
of
that
mr.
kassner,
you
going
to
get
neither
the
question
whether
because
you
got
into
the
federal
court
first
that
takes
care
of
the
younger
problem
and
even
in
the
m
&
l
or
whether
would
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
m
&
l?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
your
case
but
suppose
we
didn't
have
the
other
two
parties,
all
we
have
was
m
&
l?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
won
the
race
to
the
courthouse
door
by
getting
in
the
federal
court
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
harassment
exception.
