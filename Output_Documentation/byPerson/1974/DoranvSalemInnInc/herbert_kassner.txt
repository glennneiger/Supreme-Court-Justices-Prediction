mr.
herbert
kassner
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
initially
i
should
review
the
facts
which
were
scantly
reviewed
yesterday
because
there
seems
to
be
some
misapprehension
as
to
what
actually
took
place.
appellees
herein
where
owners
and
operators
of
premises
in
which
food
and
liquor
was
served;
one
for
a
period
of
eight
years,
one
for
a
period
of
five
years
and
one
for
a
period
of
about
two
years.
at
the
time
the
town
of
north
hempstead
passed
its
ordinance,
during
that
period,
they
had
offered
their
patrons
topless
dancing
entertainment.
the
ordinance
forbade
the
appearance
in
any
public
place
and
underlying
any
public
place
of
a
person
with
the
breast
uncovered
or
with
the
lower
part
of
the
torso
uncovered.
this
was
the
broadest
imaginable
prohibition,
it
covered
every
place
in
the
town
of
north
hempstead
and
it
specifically
covered
any
scene,
sketch,
act,
or
entertainment.
in
that
regard,
it
was
clearly
affecting
a
theatrical
performance
presumptively
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
now,
to
--
[voice
overlap]
--
it
wasn't
covering
anything
but
live
people.
mr.
herbert
kassner
the
appellees
did
not
offer
entertainment
by
a
way
of
topless
waitresses.
they
did
not
offer
topless
bartenders.
what
they
had
was,
a
real
stage,
segregated
from
the
patrons
on
which
professional
dancers
were
employed
throughout
the
day
to
offer
dancing
entertainment.
these
professional
dancers
were
hired
through
theatrical
agencies.
some
of
them
were
employed
in
ballet
work
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
did
this
to
earn
extra
money.
this
wasn't
a
situation
of
--
which
was
alluded
to
in
larue
i
believe
to
(inaudible)
in
a
place
it
served
liquor.
now,
the
appellants
herein
maintain
in
page
12
their
brief
the
method
exercised
by
the
legislative
body
to
ensure
the
health,
safety
and
well-being
of
the
community
is
not
a
proper
subject
for
review
by
this
court.
i
don't
know
whether
they're
serious
or
not
serious
in
that
contention
but
it
would
seem
that
the
statute
was
enacted.
the
ordinance
was
enacted
under
this
theory.
it
seems
that
they
denied
the
existence
of
a
supremacy
clause.
they
claim
that
they
could
undercut
the
evils,
various
nuisance
evils
at
the
source
by
passing
this
type
of
an
overbroad
speech
inhibiting
ordinance.
mr.
herbert
kassner
had
the
state
liquor
authority
in
the
state
of
new
york
drawn
an
ordinance
as
sanctioned
under
larue
involving
the
licensee,
the
sale
of
liquor
in
premises
where
this
type
of
activity
went
on,
yes
they
could've
done
so
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
your
honor
i
haven't
litigated
that
here,
i
don't
think
i
need
it.
i'll
stick
with
my
overbreadth
and
i'm
just
mentioning
as
an
aside
that
the
town
of
north
hempstead
wouldn't
have
had
the
power
to
legislate
the
type
of
larue
ordinance
which
is
permissible
but
that
is
not
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
because
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
that's
not
what
they've
said
in
this
ordinance
you
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes,
your
honor.
not
within
the
power
of
the
town
of
north
hempstead.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
no
your
honor.
but
that's
--
if
you
asked
that's
what
i'm
saying,
yes,
that's
what
i'm
saying
but
that's
not
issue
before
here
your
honor.
they
didn't
say
no
topless
dancing
in
the
town
of
north
hempstead.
they
didn't
say
no
topless
dancing
where
liquor
was
sold
in
the
town
of
north
hempstead.
they
said,
no
exposure
of
the
breast
or
the
lower
part
of
the
torso
in
the
town
of
north
hempstead
in
any
public
place,
whether
it'd
be
part
of
a
sketch,
scene,
act,
or
entertainment
or
otherwise.
so,
i'm
willing
to
deal
with
what
they
did
say
rather
than
what
they
didn't
say
and
i'm
not
depending
upon
the
fact
that
they
couldn't
have
passed
the
larue
type
statute.
there
is
a
contention
by
mr.
darago
made
yesterday
that
the
overbreadth
adjudication
is
limited
to
the
spoken
word
and
all
i
need
to
say
is
that
overbreadth
adjudication
is
limited
to
expression
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
or
presumptively
protected
by
the
first
amendment
or
expression
which
could
be
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
that
includes
a
great
deal
more
than
the
spoken
work.
he
claims
that
the
ordinance
was
aimed
at
the
elimination
of
litter,
noise,
traffic
congestion
and
unspecified
conduct
of
patrons
adjacent
to
appellees
premises
by
a
cutting-off
at
the
source.
it
should
be
noted
that
there
are
ample
laws
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
cover
those
evils
of
litter,
noise,
traffic
congestion,
and
whatever
unspecified
conduct
of
patrons
they
maybe
referring
to
that
if
there
weren't
adequate
laws
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
the
town
of
north
hempstead,
these
evils
could've
been
cope
with
by
a
more
narrowly
drawn
specifically
directed
piece
of
legislation
rather
than
what
is
referred
to
as
a
cutting
off
at
the
source.
it
would
be
just
as
appropriate
for
a
town
to
forbid
sporting
events
because
of
the
traffic
congestion
incident
to
a
stadium
or
to
forbid
political
rallies
because
of
the
congestion
incident
to
the
area
where
it
take
place
as
it
is
to
pass
this
type
of
ordinance
to
cope
with
traffic
congestion
or
noise
or
litter.
there
is
no
doubt
of
what
the
intention
of
the
town
of
north
hempstead
was.
what
i
am
arguing
here
today
under
the
doctrine
of
overbreadth
is
that
the
law
which
they
passed
was
far
too
broad
to
be
permitted
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
herbert
kassner
if
you
want
me
to
move
to
that
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'll
move
to
that
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes,
your
honor.
i
was
going
to
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
on
the
issue
of
abstention,
we
have
here
two
plaintiffs.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well
i'm
using
abstention
in
younger
versus
harris
sense
is
that
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
well
your
honor--
mr.
herbert
kassner
i've
read
you
a
decision
in
steffel
and
i've
read
your
decision
in
dombrowski
--
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
am
willing
to
assume
that
the
younger
doctrine
is
classified
as
abstention
despite
the
fact
that
the
pullman
doctrine
was
classified
as
abstention
and
there
are
two
different
facets
of
an
abstention
issue
if
you
don't
want
me
to
use
the
word
abstention,
i'll
use
comedy
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
the
younger
doctrine,
yes.
as
far
as
i
can
tell
from
my
reading
of
younger,
the
holding
in
younger
was
that
we're
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
a
federal
suit,
the
federal
plaintiff
was
then
at
that
time
a
defendant
and
a
pending
criminal
proceeding
in
a
single
pending
criminal
proceeding.
the
federal
court
would
not
take
the
case
and
send
it
back
for
adjudication
in
the
state
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor,it
would
dismiss.
mr.
herbert
kassner
it
would
dismiss.
now
we
have
two
plaintiffs
here
who
where
never
involved
in
a
pending
state
criminal
prosecution
either
before
or
after
the
commenced
to
the
federal
action.
now,
as
to
them
it
appears
clear
that
younger
does
not
apply.
now,
i
will
get
to
this
argument
of
privity
later
but
under
your
decisions
in
roe
versus
--
i
think
wade,
roe
versus
wade.
you
have
the
same
idetical
situation
of
one
man
who
was
involved
in
a
state
criminal
prosecution
and
one
man
who
wasn't
it
was
dismissed
as
to
the
one
who
was.
the
court
took
jurisdiction
and
the
term
to
the
question
to
the
one
who
doesn't.
so,
i
don't
this
is
a
noble
issue
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
only
issue
trully
in
this
case
substantive
or
procedurals
is
how
do
you
treat
m
&
l?
i
dont
think
there's
any
question
as
to
the
other
two
plaintiffs
on
the
substantive
or
procedural
issues.
so
if
you
want
me
to
go
to
how
do
you
treat
m
&
l
and
why
do
you
treat
m
&
l
that
way,
i
will
and
attack
the
heart
of
what
i
believe
is
the
only
problem
left
in
this
case
after
your
decision
is
obvious
of
production.
not
m
&
l
after
the
commencement
of
the
federal
case
violated
the
statute
and
were
subjected
to
immediate
prosecution.
i
will
get
back
to
the
fact
that
they
were
subjective
to
eight
criminal
prosecutions
at
the
period
of
four
or
five
days
later
and
bring
that
back
under
the
younger
doctrine
but
right
now
i'll
assume
that
they
had
been
subjected
to
a
single
criminal
prosecution
in
the
state
court
after
the
commencement
and
the
file
of
the
federal
action
by
the
filing
of
a
federal
complaint.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes,
the
first
criminal
prosecution
followed
a
day
by
the
filing
of
a
federal
complaint
because
they
started
violating
the
ordinance
the
day
after
the
federal
complaint
was
filed
and
the
motion
for
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
denied.
that
particular
plaintiff,
m
&
l,
did
not
have
the
staying
power
of
the
other
two.
it
was
a
question
of
economics,
they
were
being
destroyed
and
they
couldn't
accept
this
destruction
of
their
business
in
the
interim
period
that
would
take
to
determine
either
the
federal
or
the
state
action.
they
therefore
determined
to
go
ahead
and
do
it
on
the
theory
that
what
they
were
doing
would
be
vindicated
in
the
end.
the
question
is
who
should
vindicate
what
they
were
doing
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court.
now,
judge
oakes
in
his
decision
below
wrote
approximately
a
page
and
a
half
on
this
on
the
considerations
of
treating
m
&
l
differently
or
the
same
as
the
other
two
plaintiffs
and
frankly
i
can't
improve
on
either
his
words
or
his
reasoning
and
it
would
be
foolish
for
me
to
try.
he
specified
certain
consideration
which
dictated
that
m
&
l
should
be
treated
the
same
as
the
other
two
plaintiffs.
now,
with
the
other
two
plaintiffs,
you
had
no
problem,
he
just
said
that
it
is
not
younger
case
and
he
pass
on
from
that.
mr.
herbert
kassner
never
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes,
never.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
they
had
the
staying
power
to
be
able
to
do
so.
mr.
herbert
kassner
m
&
l
is
still
doing
topless
dancing.
mr.
herbert
kassner
waiting
for
this
court's
determination.
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
do
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
the
state
court
has
not
proceeded
at
all.
it's
remaining
right
where
it
was
the
date
that
they
were
arrested.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
i
wasn't
driving
to
get
the
state,
excuse
me.
mr.
herbert
kassner
they
violated
the
law
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
they
violated
the
law
which
they
believed
was
unconstitutional
because
they
believe
they
would
be
out
of
business
before
either
court
adjudicated
the
issue
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
and
if
the
issue
was
adjudicated
in
the
federal
court
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
no.
one
of
the
other
preferably
the
federal
court
because
that's
quicker.
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
don't
believe
i'm
running
into
younger.
mr.
herbert
kassner
if
m
&
l
were
the
only
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
well
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
the
question
becomes
who
initiated
the
second
court
proceeding?
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
federal
complaint,
the
local
authorities
will
put
on
notice
that
there
is
a
substantial
federal
question
involved
in
the
ordinance.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor.
the
temporary
restraining
order
was
denied.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
got
that
first
from
the
district
court,
it
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
herbert
kassner
judge
dooling
was
an
emergency
judge.
the
case
was
assigned
to
judge
bartels.
mr.
herbert
kassner
it's
after
a
hearing
and
after
about
20
or
30
days
after
reading
briefs
and
after
a
hearing,
he
entered
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
herbert
kassner
the
criminal
proceeding
for
all
intensive
purposes
was
stopped
as
soon
as
it
was
initiated.
mr.
herbert
kassner
the
state
did
no
proceed
with
it,
there
was
no
intention
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
no.
they
can't
without
violating
the
federal
injunction.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor.
the
terms
of
the
injunction
whether
the
state
was
in
the
--
defendants
were
enjoined
from
enforcing
the
ordinance.
mr.
herbert
kassner
against
these
three
plaintiff.
mr.
herbert
kassner
as
far
as
i
know,
against
these
three
plaintiffs.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
it's
in
the
jurisdictional
state
--
page
23(a)
of
the
jurisdictional
statement.
just
the
plaintiffs
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
there
was
a
likelihood
of
success.
they
did
not
declare
it
unconstitutional
as
they
couldn't
because
it
was
merely
a
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
23(a)
is
the
district
court,
i'm
talking
about
the
circuit
court
now
and
in
appendix
4(a),
judge
oakes'
decision
says
initially,
in
answer
to
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
injunctive
relief
granted
here,
we
agreed
with
the
district
court
as
to
the
probability
of
success
on
the
merits.
mr.
herbert
kassner
as
such
the
ordinance
would
have
to
fall
that
describes
the
ordinance
as
if
as
such
that
ordinance
would
have
to
fall.
your
honor,
i
think
he
meant
to
make
this
final
determination
in
their
preliminary
injunction
motion.
mr.
herbert
kassner
that
is
correct.
but
i
don't
think
you
can
attribute
that
to
judge
oakes'
decision.
that
is
clear
but
judge
oakes'
decision
is
not
that
clear,
he
seems
to
say
probability
of
success
and
use
those
words
in
the
proper
context
for
the
proper
purpose.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
it
construed
the
district
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
what
it
construed,
the
district
court's
opinion
as
being
one
of
probability
of
success,
that's
what
it
amounts
to
which
is
zero.
mr.
herbert
kassner
no
your
honor.
i
don't
think
anybody
is
damage.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor,
i
don't
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
don't
think
anybody
is
damage
by
that.
mr.
herbert
kassner
but
i
don't
--
those
aren't
the
words
he
used
in
his
declaration
on
page
23(a).
mr.
herbert
kassner
that
is
correct.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
i
think
at
that
time,
these
were
the
only
three
that
were
doing
the
activity
in
the
town.
mr.
herbert
kassner
the
activity
of
topless
dancing.
so,
they
had
all
the
parties
before
them
in
my
impression.
these
role
--
the
people
could've
been
covered
by
these
all
three
came
into
court
together,
there
was
no
class
action
because
you
had
everybody
to
start
out
with.
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
think
something
was
done
--
well,
no,
an
appeal
was
taken.
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
guess
they
would
have
to
file
an
answer
and
i
would
have
to
make
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
if
you
take
his
words
to
mean
that
this
was
not
to
be
found
a
probability
of
success
sufficient
to
warrant
an
injunction,
if
you
assume
that
that's
not
what
he
meant
when
he
said,
what
he
said,
then
he
would
undoubtedly
follow
his
prior
determination
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
but
certainly
did
end
the
case,
you
had
to
do
something.
there
would
have
to
be
motion
for
summary
judgment
after
he
joined
the
revision,
there
would
have
to
be
a
permanent
injunction
entered
and
there
could've
been
new
facts
brought
out.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
somebody
had
to
file
an
answer
to
--
somebody
had
to
make
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
in
order
to
bring
it
to
an
end
if
there
wouldn't
have
been
an
appeal
for
the
circuit
court
on
the
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes,
if
nothing
is
done,
that
would
be
effect
of
any
preliminary
injunction.
it
wouldn't
be
unusual.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
he
didn't
side
it
but
judge
oaks
a
good
judge
and
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
when
he
wrote
probability
of
success.
mr.
herbert
kassner
sometimes,
you
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes,
it
would,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
should
be
made
to
overwrite
the
words
probability
of
success
which
are
absolutely
clear.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
if
you
want
to
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
if
you
want
to
construe
judge
oakes
meaning
that,
i
don't
construe
his
meaning
that
because
he
wasn't
asked
called
unto
rule
on
that
and
he
was
called
unto
rule
on
probability
of
success,
he
used
the
words
probability
of
success,
he
meant
that
the
statute
was
overbroad
in
his
mind
at
that
point,
there
was
a
probability
of
success
because
of
the
apparent
overbreadth
of
the
statute
and
by
not
sticking
in
the
word
apparent
or
i
don't
know
whether
you
can
make
his
opinion
be
a
final
determination
or
motion
for
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
herbert
kassner
m
&
l.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes.
all
as
i
said
before,
on
this
point,
all
i'm
going
to
do
is
merely
restate
what
judge
oakes
said
because
i
can
improve
on
it.
he
spoke
about
equity
principles
granting
relief
to
two
people
in
the
same
shoes
as
a
third
person
with
respect
towards
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
i'd
be
in
trouble.
yes
i
would.
because,
i
don't
think
i
should
be
but
i
know
that
i
would
be
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
don't
think
i
should
be,
no.
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
think
that
should
determine
it
because
i
think
that
that's
the
only
reasonable
fixed
way
to
determine
jurisdiction.
the
state
courts
are
no
more
entitled
to
adjudicate
first
amendment
rights
in
the
federal
court.
i
could
make
an
excellent
argument
for
the
fact
that
the
federal
court
is
the
prime
court
for
the
adjudication
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
don't
know
whether
i'd
lose
that
argument.
mr.
herbert
kassner
no
and
younger
is
an
exception
to
that.
younger
is
an
exception
to
that
because
of
doctrines
of
committee
but
there
is
no
committee
involved
to
remove
federal
court
jurisdiction
what's
the
younger
problem
itself
does
not
arise
and
the
younger
problem
is
a
pending
criminal
prosecution
of
the
federal
plaintiff
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
a
federal
complaint.
that's
what
younger
says.
now,
i
was
disturbed
by
younger
but
younger
is
the
law
and
that
is
the
law.
mr.
herbert
kassner
i'm
willing
to
live
with
younger
but
i
don't
want
to
see
younger
expanded
to
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
excuse
me
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
i
did,
yes
i
did.
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
did.
mr.
herbert
kassner
and
continued
to
tell
them
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
no
judge
marshall,
you
know
i
didn't
do
that
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
you
know
i
didn't
do
that.
why
did
i
want
to
create
a
younger
type
problem?
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
advise
all
three
of
my
clients
to
obey
the
ordinance
at
least
pending
the
preliminary
injunction
determination.
two
of
my
clients
followed
my
instructions;
the
third
client
said
he
couldn't
take
it.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
the
denial
of
a
tro
is
not
in
adjudication
of
anything
under
merits.
mr.
herbert
kassner
i
know
that
--
that
al
three
would've
violated
the
ordinance
as
it
was
written
but
i
didn't
and
i
told
them
not
to
violate
the
ordinance
and
two
obeyed
and
one
didn't
and
the
one
didn't
because
of
economic
exigencies.
he
couldn't
stay
in
business
with
the
cut
on
business
and
that's
why
he
had
to
go
about
it.
now,
as
long
as
we're
talking
younger,
why
don't
we
talk
about
eight
prosecutions
in
a
period
of
three
or
four
days?
now,
younger
clearly
held,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
this
single
prosecution
against
harris
is
brought
in
bad
faith
or
as
only
one
of
a
series
of
repeated
prosecutions
to
which
you
will
be
subjected.
i
don't
think
younger
applies
if
he
would've
been
subjected
in
a
prosecution
before
he
filed
his
federal
complaint.
i
don't
think
the
younger
case
anyway.
mr.
herbert
kassner
yes
your
honor.
i
mean,
younger
is
clear
on
that
point.
they
serve
three
summonses,
then
they
had
five
arrests
and
they
closed
the
premises
on
four
separate
occasions
mr.
herbert
kassner
well,
the
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
they
had
this
going
on
for
eight
years
before.
they
could've
waited
10
or
20
days.
mr.
herbert
kassner
stay
its
hand
until
the
judge
determines
the
issue
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
herbert
kassner
it
depends
on
what
law
you're
talking
about
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
kassner
well
if
i
were
the
--
if
i
were
the
local
prosecutor
and
i
saw
that
there
was
a
substantial
federal
question
involved
in
the
ordinance,
i
might
wait
the
10
or
15
days
that
it
would
take
the
federal
district
judge
to
adjudicate
the
issue
and
not
quite
create
the
abrasion
that
they
themselves
are
complaining
about.
mr.
herbert
kassner
my
client
should've
waited.
mr.
herbert
kassner
he
would've
been
in
more
trouble
than
he
was
with
the
granting
of
the
preliminary
injunction
and
what
would
he
have
done?
he
might
have
continued,
he
might
have
stopped.
mr.
herbert
kassner
the
prosecutor
under
the
--
mr.
herbert
kassner
no,
your
honor.
after
a
determination
of
the
preliminary
injunction
hearing
--
on
hearings
and
on
briefs,
if
it
was
determined
that
that
should
not
be
granted
then
i
don't
think
the
prosecutor
is
bound
to
wait
any
additional
time
but
i
think
that
he
could've
waited
the
10
or
15
days
that
the
rule
have
taken
to
avoid
this
abrasion
that
he
complains
about
himself
but
i
don't
justify
my
client'
conduct.
