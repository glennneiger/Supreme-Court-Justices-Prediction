whatever
happened
to
that
south
carolina
case
that
was
up
here
when
we
decided
brown
versus
the
board
of
education?
justice
william

douglas
the
same
case?
justice
william

yes.
justice

motel?
justice
william

well
--
justice
william
o.

requiring

court
on
page
59
says
that
they
were
not
prosecuted
under
that
ordinance.
