we,
of
course,
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice

mr.
snyder,
how
can
you
say
that
in
light
of
the
testimony
in
this
record,
i
know
you're
saying
that
you
agree
that
the
ordinance
played
no
part
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
in
what
took
place.
but
mr.
west
when
he
was
asked
the
question
as
why
he
ordered
the
restaurant
--
the
lunch
counter
closed,
is
that
on
page
23
of
the
record,
it
was
contrary
to
the
local
custom
and
that
also
the
ordinance
that
have
been
discussed?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
ignored
that
in
your
brief.
now,
what
could
be
that?
is
it
relevant
to
what
you're
discussing
now?
justice

mr.
snyder,
would
you
mind
at
this
point
if
it
doesn't
disturb
the
course
of
your
argument,
saying
a
word
about
whether
--
in
connection
with
whether
the
manager
was
operating
under
his
own
esteem
as
were
in
this
area
about
the
propriety
of
the
trial
judge's
action
in
refusing
to
permit
mr.
perry
to
inquire
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
had
been
prearrangement
with
the
police
to
take
action
in
connection
with
the
“sit-in”?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
think
it
was
foreclosed
by
this
ruling
of
the
trial
judge?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
wouldn't
the
--
would
it
not
have
been
appropriate
in
connection
with
that
answer
to
pursue
the
question
of
whether
the
police
had
in
effect
asserted
the
ordinance
with
him,
because
as
i
read
the
record
and
i
am
starting
on
page
22
where
that
offer
was
made,
mr.
perry
was
foreclosed
by
the
judge
unless
he
would
persist
after
a
judge's
ruling
which
he
could
not
very
well
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
pursuing
that
line
of
inquiry.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
would
you
not
read
his
comment
after
the
objection
was
sustained
as
being
equivalent
to
an
offer
of
proof
when
he
stated
what
he
purported
to
bring
out
in
this
line
of
questioning?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
are
there
any
restaurants
in
greenville
where
a
negro
can
be
--
can
get
meals,
do
you
know
of,
mr.
perry?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
have
not
in
the
main
section
of
town.
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
