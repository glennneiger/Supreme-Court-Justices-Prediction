justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
a
constitutional
right
to
select
his
customers?
i
don't
quite
understand
myself
why
that's
the
primary
--
where
you
have
to
stop,
i
just
don't
quite
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
a
ruling
of
common
law.
common
law
in
this
country,
every
way
i
know
of,
it
can
be
changed
by
statute,
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
a
constitutional
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
--
i
presume
the
constitutional
question
is
whether
the
constitution
itself
forbids
what
has
been
charged
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
a
--
the
state
cannot
pass
a
law
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
sort
of
raising
a
question
that
the
state
couldn't
pass
the
law,
are
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
forbids
this
discrimination.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
must
have
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
said
--
i
must
have
been
wrong
that
the
ordinance
didn't
constitute
state
action,
did
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
--
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
believe
that
this
ordinance
would
not
be
enforced
against
white
people
who
went
into
the
restaurants
set
apart
for
negroes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
you
were
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
argument
--
that
particular
argument
go
--
would
it
require
the
guest,
that
the
man
goes
into
another
man's
property,
store,
anything,
and
the
man
doesn't
want
him
there
and
he
had
a
perfect
legal
right
to
tell
him
so
that
the
state
couldn't
protect
him
in
that
right,
(inaudible)
by
the
police
officers?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
about
the
argument
you
have
just
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
could
mean
--
the
idea
of
the
law
under
--
the
right
of
the
courts
to
have
laws,
to
keep
all
personal
difficulties
and
keep
things
from
being
settled
by
force
and
violence,
is
that
if
the
citizen
has
a
right
under
the
law,
first,
a
valid
right
to
do
something,
that
if
the
state
can
come
in
and
protect
that
right
with
its
officials,
that
usually
been
the
case,
are
you
saying
that
that
is
not
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
you're
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
denying
it
to
have
a
legal
right,
i
understand
that
argument
and
i
understand
the
other
one,
i
think.
i
thought
i
did,
but
that
--
i
just
wanted
to
know
if
that
was
your
position,
the
state
is
without
power
through
its
police
force
and
its
officials
to
protect
people,
people's
right
on
the
assumption
that
they
have
the
right.
