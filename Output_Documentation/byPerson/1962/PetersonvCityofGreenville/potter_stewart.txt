i
didn't
understand
that,
it's
a
crime
to
do
what?
justice

to
give
a

child
--
justice

i
don't

alright.
justice

stewart
oh,
what
is
it?
i
suppose
it's
a

that's
to
give
your

away
to
anybody,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
it's
not
vital
to
this
case,
of
course,
it
was
my
curiosity.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
of
--
excuse
me.
have
any
of
these
statutes

that?
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
prior
discussion
of
the

is
that
in
the

justice

stewart
but
that's
not
the
inquiry.
the
inquiry
is
what
motivated
the

of
this
store
to
tell
these
people
to
leave.
and
he
says
it's
because
of
the
ordinance
as
been
discussed.
that's
the
point.
it's
not
what
these
petitioners
were
convicted
of
violating,
it's
what
motivated
the
manager
of
this
store
to
tell
them
to
get
out.
and
he
said
it's
the
ordinance
that
motivated
him.

local
custom
and
this
--
justice

stewart
--
company's
policy
to
follow
local
custom
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
ordinance.
justice
potter
stewart
how
could
that
motivate

excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
about
giving
your
baby
away?
justice

stewart
to
the
kind
of
a
foster
parent?
