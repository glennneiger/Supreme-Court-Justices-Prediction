mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
before
getting
into
the
legal
issues,
there's
just
one
part
of
the
factual
statement
by
mr.
perry
that
i
would
like
to
mention
and
that
is
the
remarks
he
made
concerning
some
of
the
testimony
that
it
was
testified
by
the
store
manager
that
prior
to
the
time
of
the
arrest,
all
of
the
white
customers
departed
as
a
result
of
his
request
for
everybody
to
leave
the
lunch
counter.
one
of
the
defense
witnesses
testified
to
the
contrary
that
all
of
the
white
customers
did
not
leave
as
a
result
of
the
manager's
request.
that
presented
squarely
to
the
court
below,
to
the
trial
court
and
to
the
--
a
question
of
facts
to
be
decided
in
the
case
and
it
is
to
be
decided
by
the
trial
court
on
those
facts
that
the
white
people
did
leave
at
the
request
of
the
manager.
now,
that
holding
by
the
trial
court,
we
submit,
is
conclusive
upon
this
court
because
it
is
amply
supported
by
the
facts
in
the
case.
now,
getting
into
the
legal
issues,
there
seemed
to
me
to
be
perhaps
three
basic
issues
in
this
entire
case.
the
first
thing
you
have
to
get
to
when
you
discuss
these
cases
at
all
is
the
question
of
not
whether
a
person
who
runs
a
restaurant
or
any
other
kind
of
store
has
a
right
in
the
first
analysis
to
choose
the
people
with
whom
he
would
do
business.
if
he
has
no
such
right,
then
the
whole
thing
is
ended
right
there.
you
have
to
resolve
that
issue
first.
now,
let's
look
at
the
case
here
and
see
whether
or
not
this
retail
store
who,
as
a
restaurant
there,
does
have
that
right.
you
have
to
go
back
to
decide
that
first
of
all
to
the
common
law.
and
you
will
find
when
you
go
back
that
there
is
no
statute
in
the
case
which
discussed
this,
so
you
have
to
rely
on
the
common
law.
you'll
see
what
the
rights
of
restaurant
owners
have
been
in
the
times
has
placed
and
you
will
find,
when
you
examine
that
that
shopkeepers
and
people
who
did
business
with
the
public
in
general
had
a
right
under
the
common
law
to
choose,
to
select
those
people
with
whom
they
would
do
business.
and
they
have
that
as
an
absolute
right.
now,
that
rule
was
not
without
exceptions
and
we
have
to
admit
that.
the
first
exception
and
probably
the
most
important
exception
as
the
case
of
innkeepers
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
or
the
rules,
see
why
it
was
that
innkeepers
would
treat
it
different
and
the
facts
that
for
the
different
treatment
of
innkeepers
bring
out
the
facts
of
life
as
they
existed
in
england
at
time
those
rules
grew
up.
and
they
showed
that
as
far
as
the
innkeepers
were
concerned,
that
was
tied
in
with
travel
in
those
times.
and
that
was
the
time
when
the
roads
were
very
poor,
when
travel
was
slow
either
by
horseback
or
coach
and
you
couldn't
make
much
time.
there
was
also
a
time
when
law
enforcement
was
not
as
good
as
it
is
now,
and
there
were
a
lot
of
robbers
in
highways
and
we
read
about
it
in
the
novels
at
that
time,
who
were
prevalent
on
the
highways.
so,
that
a
traveler
travelling
alone
had
to
have
some
sort
of
protection.
he
had
to
have
a
place
to
rest
his
horses
or
his
means
of
conveyance,
get
feed
for
them,
and
he
also
had
to
find
a
place
to
obtain
provision
for
himself
and
the
place
of
safety
and
comfort
overnight
during
the
time
when
it
was
hardly
possible
to
travel.
so
that
made
the
reason
for
the
distinction
of
innkeepers
in
the
first
place.
now,
the
second
class
of
things
that
grew
up
along
with
the
(voice

--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
i
think
they
are
relevant
your
honor.
i
think
it's
relevant
because
it
shows
the
reason
why
a
proprietor
has
the
right
to
select
his
customers.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
that
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
well
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
that's
right.
well,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
no,
we're
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
the
state
could
pass
such
a
law
but
having
passed
a
law,
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
which
requires
the
state
to
force
a
storeowner
to
give
equal
treatment
to
all
who
would
seek
to
purchase
something
properly.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
yes
sir.
i
think
that's
the
question.
and
i
--
as
i
say
there
is
--
there's
nothing
--
the
constitution
places
no
affirmative
duty
on
a
state
to
see
to
it
that
an
operator
of
a
store
offer
his
goods
to
all
who
would
seek
them.
the
constitution
leaves
that
area
open
as
far
as
the
storeowner's
choice
except
insofar
as
the
constitution
does
not
prohibit
a
state
from
passing
a
law
changing
the
common
law
situation
which
existed
prior
to
the
constitution.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
yes
sir.
that
aspect
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
i
explained
the
ordinance
under
that
by
saying
that
the
ordinance
does
not
make
state
action.
now,
your
honor,
you
referred
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
that
brings
us
in
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
this
--
the
section
of
the
constitution
that
we
are
under
in.
and
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
i
understand
it
and
how
i
understand
the
decisions
under
it,
some
state
action
must
have
taken
place
which
deprives
a
citizen
of
either
due
process
or
some
life,
liberty
or
property.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
the
ordinance
does
not
do
that,
in
my
opinion,
your
honor.
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
the
ordinance
which
i
concede
is
probably
unconstitutional
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
placed
an
obligation
on
the
storeowner,
restaurant
operator
to
maintain
separate
facilities
with
a
division,
either
of
space
or
a
wall,
as
the
case
may
be
and
to
use
separate
utensils
and
facilities
for
the
accommodation
of
the
two
races.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
now
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
i
do
not
have
that,
your
honor.
but
i
--
and
i
understand
that
it
has
been
on
the
books
for
sometime.
it
was
in
the
volume
of
the
code
of
the
city
of
greenville
which
was
passed
in
1953.
it
came
out
in
1954.
it
was
slightly
amended
and
now
appears
in
the
pocket
supplement
as
amended.
but
its
predecessor,
which
was
substantially
the
same,
had
been
there
for
some
time
to
perform
that.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
the
ordinance
didn't
constitute
state
action.
i
am
saying
that
the
ordinance
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
is
not
state
action
which
deprives
these
petitioners
of
any
federally
protected
right.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
i
didn't
attempt
to
ignore
it.
i
think
that
what
he
is
saying
is,
first
of
all,
what
he
said
on
direct
examination
that
it
was
contrary
to
customs
which
was
the
orders
from
the
store
headquarters
which
order
was
made
without
reference
to
the
ordinance
in
which
he
would've
had
to
follow,
whether
this
ordinance
was
here
or
not.
and
secondly,
the
fact
that
there
is
confusion
in
this
record,
when
he
says
--
it's
also
the
ordinance
that
has
been
discussed.
if
you
look
back
to
see
what
he's
talking
about
when
he
said,
“that's
the
ordinance
that
has
been
discussed”,
you
received
it
in
the
prior
testimony,
the
witnesses
have
been
referring
both
to
this
city
ordinance
and
the
state
trespass
law
under
which
the
petitioners
were
convicted
as
an
ordinance
and
it's
not
clear
to
which
one
he
was
referring.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
we
think
that
he
was
referring
to
the
state
law.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
ordinance
requiring
segregation
in
restaurants
does
not
punish
people
like
the
petitioners.
its
prohibition
runs
only
against
the
storeowner.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
they
--
i
think
that's
correct,
i
don't
know.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
he
said
--
yes
sir.
he
--
in
two
parts,
first
this
company's
orders
and
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
yes.
and
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
and
ordinance,
and
we
say
that
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
we
say
--
that
when
he
said
that
the
ordinance
as
been
discussed,
he
is
referring
to
the
state
trespass
statute.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
it
didn't
only
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
that's
right
and
that's
--
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
it
motivated
him
but
aware
that
he
had
that
right,
he
acted
as
he
did.
if
he
has
not
been
aware
of
that
right,
he
might
have
taken
some
other
act,
could've
done
something
different.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
i
think
it
is.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
i
think
it
was
sort
of
incorporated
in
the
evidence
in
--
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
the
petitioners
to
argue
about
it
because
they
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
--
made
that
point.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
i
think
it
is.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
mr.
perry,
in
his
argument,
discussed
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you
have
state
action
here
as
a
result
of
state
law
and
the
custom
behind
that
is
generating
a
massive
body
and
he
cited
all
of
these
various
statutes.
the
biggest
part
of
those
statutes,
however,
are
either
dead
well
as
for
example
the
one
is
textile
mills
requiring
various
separate
facilities
in
textiles.
that
has
never
been
enforced
in
any
way.
the
public
library
in
the
city
of
greenville
is
operating
on
a
completely
unsegregated
basis.
the
bus
and
railroad
stations
are
unsegregated
and
that
there
is
no
policy
of
segregation
in
them
at
all,
likewise,
the
airports
which
is
operating
on
a
separate
and
independent
thing.
so,
we
submit,
first
of
all
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
that
law,
as
i
understand
it,
refers
to
either
adoptions
or
cases
similar
to
adoptions
were
the
custody
of
a
child
might
be
placed
with
somebody
by
a
court
prior
to
adoption
or
placing
a
family
or
an
orphan
with
somebody
who
wants
to
raise
it
up.
so,
it
would
be
also
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
yes
sir.
because
as
far
as
we
do
have
a
law
which
permits
the
indenture
of
(inaudible),
but
i
think
that
would
be
the
same
rule,
you
reach
the
question
on
custom
where
you
consider
that
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
law
was
in
effect
won't
support
us
to
the
custom,
we
submit
can
never
have
the
force
of
law.
custom
is
something
that's
too
tenuous
to
actually
be
so
strong
as
to
be
a
law
and
to
be
state
action
in
the
case.
there's
no
way,
we
submit,
for
anybody
who
can
be
charged
with
violating
the
law
to
be
charged
with
violating
a
custom
as
law.
the
man
that
would
be
ex
post
facto,
when
i
think,
if
a
man
were
charged
with
a
crime
for
example
for
violating
a
custom,
how
would
he
know
that?
how
would
he
know
about
it?
how
would
one
ever
know
when
a
custom
changed?
how
could
you
have
anything
that
would
give
any
certainty
to
anybody
regarding
a
custom
to
--
if
you
were
to
say
a
custom
could
have
the
force
of
law.
we
submit
that
it
does
not.
we
think
that
the
primary
issue
here
is
first
of
all
whether
or
not
this
man
had
the
right
to
eject
anybody
that
he
didn't
have
in
his
premises
or
take
this
trespass
statute
to
help
him
if
he
didn't
want
to
take
the
law
in
his
own
hands
to
do
that.
and
under
our
law,
under
the
trespass
situation,
if
you
didn't
go
to
a
--
if
you
didn't
first
used
the
law,
he
would
have
the
right
under
the
decision
in
our
cases
to
protect
his
own
private
property
by
ejecting
trespassers
who
would
be
people
who
would
refuse
to
leave
his
property
when
he
asked
them
to
and
wouldn't
obey
his
orders,
he
would
have
the
right
under
our
law
and
i
think
properly
under
most
state
law
that
to
use
whatever
force
was
necessary
to
reject
such
person.
now,
the
law
does
a
favor
to
people
taking
the
force
of
law
into
their
own
hands.
the
troubles
that
would
arise
if
a
man,
a
store
owner
or
anybody
took
it
upon
himself
to
throw
out,
people
who
refuse
to
obey
his
order
to
leave,
would
be
a
multitude
of
problems,
you're
going
to
have
not
only
mild
resistance,
you're
going
to
have
cases
where
people
resist
with
a
great
deal
of
force
and
it
can
lead
to
not
only
broken
bones
but
deaths,
and
that's
something
that
nobody
wants
to
have.
that
is
a
case
--
in
that
case,
where
a
landowner
or
property
owner
or
a
storeowner
should
be
permitted
to
resort
to
the
law
with
the
force
that
could
be
administered
impartially
and
with
an
even
hand.
not
something
where
he
is
in
there
fighting
and
strangling
and
using
force
in
a
prejudiced
manner
where
his
personal
interest
are
so
involved.
he
needs
somebody
from
the
outside
that
is
not
personally
bound
up
in
the
use
of
that
force.
if
you
don't
do
that,
you're
going
to
have
a
question
of
whether
or
not
a
man
can
use
his
own
force.
you're
going
to
come
to
the
situation,
for
example,
if
it
was
to
be
held
that
a
man
could
not
resort
to
a
statute
like
this,
to
eject
anybody
that
he
doesn't
like.
he's
going
to
come
to
a
situation
where
everybody
is
going
to
have
to
take
the
law
under
their
own
hands
and
you're
going
to
have
to
hold
that
by
virtue
of
enacting
the
law
is
the
--
is
this
city
ordinance
requiring
segregation,
you're
going
to
actually
by
letting
a
city
enact
an
unconstitutional
law,
deprive
a
landowner
of
the
right
that
he
otherwise
would've
had
under
state
law
which
permitted
him
to
use
state
force
to
protect
his
property
rights
and
eject
trespassers.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
--
yes
sir.
i
think
he
did,
not
explicitly
but
in
the
sense
that
he
telephoned
for
the
police
to
come
there
and
that
when
they
came
there
he
requested
the
petitioners
to
leave.
and
in
the
presence
of
the
police
who
heard
the
request,
they
refused
to
leave,
were
given
unreasonable
opportunity
and
did
not
leave
which
constituted
a
misdemeanor
committed
in
their
presence.
and
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
there
was
never
--
i
admit.
there
was
never
any
expressed
request
by
him
to
arrest
them
in
formal
words.
but
i
say
that
the
facts
show
that
there
was
a
request.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
yes.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
the
manager
testified
to
that.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
that
he
asked
one
of
his
subordinates
to
telephone
the
police
to
come
to
the
premises.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
one
of
the
chief
issues
in
this
case
as
well
as
the
other
cases
which
is
in
the
brief
before
you
gentlemen
is
the
question
of
freedom
of
speech
whether
or
not
these
petitioners
were
exercising
any
right
of
freedom
of
speech
when
they
staged
this
“sit-in”
demonstration.
we
submit
that
they
were
not.
first,
of
all
in
considering
the
question
of
freedom
of
speech,
you
have
to
consider
where
the
traditional
area
for
speech
in
public
speaking
has
taken
place
in
this
country
and
we
found
on
looking
at
cases
that
the
traditional
area
of
speech
where
you
have
people
who
--
to
begin
with
or
not
(inaudible)
to
speak
in
detail,
as
between
the
associates
or
friends
in
a
private
discussion,
is
that
they
have
to
meet
in
the
public
places
for
that
discussion,
that
is
on
the
streets,
in
the
park,
in
the
places
where
ordinary
people
would
come
together
who
had
something
that
they
wished
to
talk
about.
then
we
think
it's
proper
that
people
should
have
the
freedom
to
speak
to
each
other
and
try
to
convince
others
of
their
views
when
they
meet
on
public
places,
in
a
place
like
that,
and
we
think
they
have
a
right
go
there
to
try
to
convince
others
of
their
thoughts,
of
their
ideas.
you
go
a
step
further,
however,
when
you
have
a
person
who
wishes
to
try
to
convince
someone
else
of
his
ideas
and
thoughts
when
he
goes
onto
that
man's
private
property
to
do
so,
and
that's
what
you
have
in
this
case.
the
petitioners
who
claimed
they
were
exercising
the
right
of
speech
had
left
the
traditional
area
of
speech
which
is
out
in
the
public
and
out
in
the
open
and
they
have
gone
inside
the
store
where
they
now
seek
to
speak
not
to
the
other
public
in
general,
not
to
someone
who
may
be
by
chance
coming
down
the
street,
but
where
they
had
seek
to
speak
to
the
owner
or
the
manager
or
the
operator
of
these
particular
premises.
so
they
have
narrowed
down
in
two
ways
from
first,
they
have
moved
away
from
the
traditional
area
of
speech.
and
second,
they
have
moved
in
and
they
have
narrowed
their
desire
to
speak
to
a
particular
person
and
not
to
speak
to
anyone
in
general
or
to
anyone
who
may
be
happened
to
be
present.
now,
they
might
have
that
right
and
we
don't
deny
that
they
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
store,
to
attempt
to
speak
to
the
manager,
or
to
anyone
that
may
be
there.
they
have
at
least
the
right
to
make
an
attempt
to
go
there
and
begin
a
conversation.
but
we
submit
that
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
stay
there
and
force
the
person
they
found
there
whether
he
might
be
the
manager
or
someone
else
to
stay
and
listen
to
their
ideas.
they
have
no
right
to
force
him
to
listen
to
them
on
his
own
property
when
he
does
not
desire
to
listen
to
them.
if
he
does,
he
takes
away
from
that
person
his
right
of
speaking
himself.
he
has
no
chance
to
do
anything
else.
the
law
even
in
the
public
places
has,
as
it's
concerning
freedom
of
speech
here
before,
has
given
the
right
of
the
person
that
he
has
spoken
to
either
to
refuse
to
listen
or
to
require
the
person
who
would
speak
to
move
away.
for
example,
in
cantwell
against
connecticut,
you
had
a
speech
problem
with
the
persons
that
--
where
they
would
be
listeners
after
they
had
heard
all
that
they
desired
to
hear,
require
the
speaker
to
move
on.
they
moved
on
themselves
to
--
because
they
didn't
want
to
hear
anymore
and
they
have
that
right.
you
have
the
same
question
in
the
doorbell
cases
where
on
the
grounds
of
freedom
of
religion,
a
person
has
the
right
to
ring
a
doorbell
to
someone,
the
householder,
but
the
householder
is
not
required
to
stand
there
and
listen
to
whatever
the
speaker
may
have
to
say.
he
has
a
right
if
he
does
not
agree
with
the
person
to
require
him
to
move
on.
he
is
not
required
by
any
measure
for
freedom
of
speech
to
engage
in
a
conversation
with
that
person
if
he
does
not
desire
to
and
that's
what
you
have
in
this
case,
where
the
manager
after
he
had
heard
the
side
of
the
argument
presented
to
him
by
the
petitioners,
didn't
desire
to
negotiate
with
them,
didn't
desire
to
discuss
the
question
with
them
any
further,
and
he
asked
them
to
proceed
about
their
own
business
somewhere
else.
that
was
his
right.
he
didn't
have
to
sit
there
and
listen
to
their
demands
hour
after
hour.
when
he
had
told
them
that,
their
duty
was
then
to
proceed
and
take
their
conversation
somewhere
else.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
i
think
in
that
connection
your
honor
that
the
petitioners
would
have
had
a
right
to
prove
if
they
could
have.
the
fact
that
there
was
a
prearrangement
with
the
police
in
which
the
police
had
directed
the
store
manager
or
the
storeowners
to
take
the
course
of
action
that
he
did.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
they're
not,
sir,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
after
the
first
objection
was
made
and
sustained,
the
witness
mr.
west's
manager
was
asked
for
what
reason
did
he
then
exclude
the
petitioners
and
his
answer
was
not
because
of
some
prearrangement
but
because
of
the
custom
and
the
ordinance
which
had
been
discussed
which
was
the
ordinance
to
prove
--
which
we
submit
prohibiting
trespass
after
notice.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
but
we
were
--
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
we
would
not
require
him
to
persist
after
his
objection
has
been
overruled,
but
on
our
procedure,
your
honor
that
man,
who
has
been
foreclosed
in
this
manner,
may
if
he
desires
and
if
he
wishes
to
protect
and
sustain
his
objection
there,
should've
made
an
offer
of
proof
into
the
record
which
he
had
a
right
to
do.
in
other
words,
he
could
have
stated
for
the
record
at
that
point
about
the
waiver
of
proof
what
the
testimony
of
the
manager
was
anticipated
to
be
on
that
point.
and
he
could
have
done
that
if
he
so
desired,
but
he
did
not.
the
fact
that
he
did
not
shows
to
us
the
fact
that
the
manager
could
not
be
expected
to
have
testified
as
to
any
such
an
arrangement.
mr.
theodore
a.
snyder,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
don't
read
it
that
way.
i
understand
what
he
was
stating
that
his
objection
was
that
he
desired
to
attempt
to
show
by
cross-examination
but
he
did
not
state
that
he
expected
the
manager
to
testify
to
that
effect,
which
he
would
have
had
gone
if
he
wanted
to
make
a
proof
--
an
offer
of
proof
in
the
case.
in
conclusion,
just
let
me
say
that
we
have
here
under
the
fourteen
amendment
the
question
of
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
--
you're
going
to
have
to
balance
two
things
really.
you
have
a
property
right
on
the
one
hand,
in
the
hands
of
the
property
owner
here.
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
the
asserted
right
of
these
petitioners
to
a
portion
of
their
liberty.
this
court,
is
absolutely
--
this
has
got
to
draw
the
line
between
those
two
rights
which
are
both
equally
protected
and
as
i
read
the
amendment
in
the
decisions
of
coequal
rights.
the
court
has
got
to
decide
whether
or
not
one
right
would
give
way
to
the
other
in
these
circumstances.
we
submit
that
in
this
--
in
the
case
that
is
presented
here
and
under
its
facts
that
the
court
should
decide
that
the
property
right
of
the
owner
of
this
property
is
paramount
to
the
right
of
the
petitioners
to
have
their
liberty
there,
on
these
premises,
for
the
purposes
for
which
they
were
present.
thank
you.
