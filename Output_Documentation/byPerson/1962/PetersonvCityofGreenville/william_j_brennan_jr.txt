william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
a
counter
with
seats
though,
wasn't
it
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
--
it's
just
a
counter,
it's
not
a
restaurant
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
table
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
that
formally
(inaudible)
necessary
to
your
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
does
that
appear?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean
--
i
gather
what
you're
saying
is
you
made
a
formal
offer
of
it
in
evidence
and
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
offer
was
refused?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
me
where
that
appears?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
waste
--
you
can
give
it
to
me
later.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that
section
31
(b)
is
amended,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
to
me
when
we
were
referred
at
page
46
to
the
offer
of
the
ordinance
we're
talking
about,
now,
not
the
trespass
one,
but
this
one
involving
separate
seating.
it
was
offered
and
the
offer
refused
it,
at
page
59,
your
court
says,
supreme
court
says,
“the
ordinance
was
made
a
part
of
the
record
upon
request
of
defendant's
counsel.
the
defendants
were
not
charged
with
having
violated
any
of
its
provision.”
is
that
ordinance
properly
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
point
then
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
it
is
in
the
record
for
our
consideration?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thanks.
