mr.
william
i.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
thank
you.
new
york
is
here
in
this
court,
if
the
court
please,
seeking
to
reverse
a
judgment
and
order
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
which
we
believe
has
seriously
infringed
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
particularly
important
and
delicate
field
of
its
right,
its
constitutional
right
to
make
reasonable
rules
and
regulations
in
the
administration
of
its
criminal
justice,
and
i
believe,
certainly,
i
hope
that
the
statement
of
the
history
of
the
case
were
in
itself
practically
be
enough
to
demonstrate
the
correctness
of
our
contention
without
any
extended
discussion
of
the
principles
of
law
which
are
involved
because
it
would
be,
it
seems
to
me
unnecessarily
a
waste
of
time
for
me
to
argue
the
principles
of
law
which
have
been
laid
down
by
this
court
and
have
been
written
about
and
decided
upon
by
this
court
in
a
number
instances
which
are
in
my
brief.
in
1942,
three
men
were
indicted
by
a
grand
jury
in
kings
county
which
is
the
famous
borough
of
brooklyn,
new
york
for
the
crime
of
murder
in
the
first
degree.
they
were
this
respondent
noia,
a
man
named
caminito
and
a
man
named
bonino.
and
the
charge
against
them
was
that
during
the
commission
of
a
robbery,
they
had
killed
a
man
named
(inaudible)
--
hammeroff.
they
were
put
to
trial
and
the
only
evidence
which
the
people
produced
against
them
aside
from
the
corpus
delicti
was
the
respective
confession
of
each
of
the
defendants.
the
confessions
of
each
attack
as
being
involuntary,
as
a
product
of
police
brutality
and
when
the
evidence
was
all
in,
the
trial
court
charged
the
jury
that
this
was
the
only
evidence
against
each
defendant,
this
confession
and
that
the
jury
--
that
the
jury
had
to
find
the
confession
both
voluntary
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
true
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
that
the
people's
proof
didn't
reach
that
measure
of
quantity
and
quality.
the
respective
defendant
as
to
whom
the
people
failed
should
be
acquitted.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
our
statute
which
is
i
think
399
of
the
code
of
criminal
procedure
requires
--
says
that
a
confession
alone
--
a
confession
may
be
received
in
evidence
against
the
defendant
unless
it
is
the
product
of
force,
threats
or
promise
of
immunity
by
the
district
attorney.
the
only
other
thing
that
is
necessary
is
direct
proof
of
the
corpus
delicti.
but
if
the
jury
finds
as
it
did
in
this
case,
that
the
confession
was
voluntary
and
true
and
if
we
successfully
proved
the
corpus
delicti,
a
basis,
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
verdict
and
for
the
judgment
which
was
subsequently
entered
here,
the
jury
under
our
law
has
the
power
to
recommend
clemency,
they
did
so
and
each
of
these
men
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
we
leave
it
to
the
jury.
there's
a
good
deal
of
debate
in
new
york
at
the
present
time
as
to
the
propriety
of
that,
but
we
still
leave
it
to
the
jury.
i'm
‘neither
a
prophet
nor
a
prophet's
son'
but
i
think
the
time
would
come
when
we
use
a
different
system.
now,
i'm
coming
to
what
is
factually
the
most
crucial
question
in
this
whole
case.
bonino
and
caminito
each
appealed
first
to
the
appellate
division
and
they
had
an
absolute
right
to
do
so
because
they
had
the
funds
to
print
the
record
and
the
brief.
that
court
unanimously
affirmed
the
judgment
against
the
contention
of
some
procedural
error
and
also
the
repeated
contention
of
coerced
confessions.
they
got
the
leave
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
that
court
unanimously
affirmed
the
convictions.
now,
i
ask
your
honors
to
remember
as
the
very
cornerstone
and
i
believe
eventually
the
capstone
of
this
case
that
noia
did
not
appeal.
this
is
the
question
on
which
the
whole
case
turns.
now,
we
--
caminito
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
the
trial
court
charged
the
jury
that
in
noia's
confession,
he
had
admitted
that
he
was
as
your
honor
so
graphically
puts
it,
the
triggerman.
he
fired
a
fatal
shot.
now
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh
no.
i
haven't
--
i've
abstained
from
any
discussion
of
the
facts
in
the
case.
i
may
answer
your
honor
now
and
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
perhaps
preclude
myself
from
further
argument
by
telling
you
that
our
position
is
that
because
noia
did
not
follow
out
or
did
not
avail
himself
of
the
rights
of
appeal
which
new
york
gave
him,
he
had
no
right
ultimately
to
come
in
to
the
district
court,
the
federal
district
court
to
seek
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
i
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
have
a
good
deal
of
material
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
have
a
good
deal
of
material
on
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
he
was.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
as
to
whether
or
not
he
could
appeal?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that
i
think
we
successfully
showed
that
in
a
hearing
held
in
the
district
court
on
the
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
caminito
and
bonino
applied
to
this
court
for
certiorari
and
it
was
denied
and
i
think
mr.
justice
black
and
mr.
justice
douglas
dissented
in
that
instance.
we
have
no
--
we
have
no
statute
of
rule
in
new
york
which
limits
the
time
for
a
motion
for
reargument
and
so
caminito
made
two
motions
for
reargument
and
they
were
both
denied
by
our
court
of
appeals,
then
he
came
into
this
court
and
asked
for
certiorari
and
it
was
denied.
that
put
him
into
a
position
under
section
2254
of
the
united
states
code
annotated
to
apply
for
a
writ
of
--
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
he
did
so
and
the
district
court
in
the
northern
district
by
judge
foley
dismissed
the
petition.
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed
judge
foley
and
sustained
the
petition.
in
effect,
it
reversed
the
judgment
of
conviction
against
caminito
and
i
--
we
applied
here
to
this
court
for
certiorari
from
that
order
and
our
petition
was
denied.
now
bonino
enters
the
picture.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that
the
confession
against
him
had
been
extorted.
now,
bonino
enters
the
picture
and
he
makes
the
motion
in
the
state
court
of
appeals
for
reargument
and
our
court
of
appeals
grants
the
reargument
and
upon
the
reargument,
reverses
itself,
reverses
the
judgment
of
conviction.
and
while
it
is
not
in
the
record,
i
don't
think
i'm
indulging
in
any
propriety
--
impropriety
when
i
say
that
at
my
request,
our
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
said
that
from
any
retrial
of
bonino
which
would
follow,
which
might
follow,
we
should
not
use
his
confession.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
who's
this?
noia?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
i
believe
that
just
as
bonino
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
--
took
advantage
of
caminito's
good
fortune
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
taken
the
decision
of
the
second
circuit
as
a
pattern
for
noia
just
as
it
did
for
bonino
and
would
have
reversed
as
to
him.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
we
still
have
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
you
mean,
if
he
had
appealed
originally.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
i'm
going
to
make
the
point
that
on
the
--
that
the
real
reason
why
noia
did
not
appeal
from
the
original
judgment
of
conviction
was
that
he
was
satisfied
at
the
time
at
least
with
the
judgment
of
life
imprisonment
and
didn't
want
to
risk
for
retrial.
i
think
i
proved
that
in
the
district
court
in
a
proceeding
to
which
i
will
refer.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
it's
still
outstanding
that
about
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
now,
they're
six,
seven
years
old,
i
may
say
to
your
honors
that
i
don't
see
how
we
can
possibly
retry
him.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that
and
also
the
famous
decision
in
our
court
of
appeals,
the
people
against
prosser,
i
think
the
minute
we
seek
to
reactivate
these
indictments
against
caminito
and
noia
and
bonino,
we'd
be
met
with
the
argument
of
undue
delay
and
prosecution
just
as
this
court
held
in
the
provo
case.
el
paso
case
is
like
the
provo
case
in
this
court.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
would
think
so.
now,
your
honors,
i
realize
the
judges
being
men
before
they
are
judges
and
at
the
same
time
simultaneously
men
as
they
are
judges.
this
is
not
a
very
collatable
situation.
here
are
two
men,
caminito
and
bonino
who
are
out
on
bail
and
for
all
intents
and
purposes
are
free.
and
here
is
a
man
noia
who
if
i
am
successful
on
this
appeal
would
have
to
go
back
to
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
i
have
two
answers
for
that.
one
answer
is
that
it's
not
a
situation
that
i
will
make
--
a
situation
he's
making
and
that
he
failed
to
avail
himself
of
his
right
to
appeal.
and
the
other
is
and
if
i'm
seeing
anything
improper
here,
i
hope
somebody
from
the
bench
will
stop
me.
we
would
be
ready
to
do
here
what
we've
done
in
other
instances.
not
exactly
like
this
but
instances
where
there
seems
regardless
of
the
question
of
guilt,
there
seems
to
be
an
inequity
in
the
eventual
treatment
of
two
or
more
defendants.
if
this
man,
noia
will
appear
ever
made
an
application
to
the
government
of
the
state
of
new
york
for
clemency,
i'll
work
out
some
sort
of
result
which
would
put
him
so
far
as
it
lays
within
our
problem
on
a
parity,
on
an
equality
with
bonino
and
caminito.
i
don't
think
its
material
to
this
case.
i'm
certainly
not
suggesting
that
as
a
price
for
the
reversal
of
the
order
of
the
second
circuit
but
in
order
to
meet
what
i
think
was
the
real
ground
of
decision
by
the
majority
in
the
court
below,
i'm
saying
to
this
court
as
i've
said
to
every
court
before
whom
i've
appeared
and
i
have
a
history
of
litigation
of
this
case
for
years
now
that
we
don't
like
this
situation
either.
even
though
it's
not
performed
with
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york,
even
though
it
is
a
situation
which
noia
brought
upon
himself
by
not
appealing,
we
don't
like
it
either.
now
to
get
back
to
the
facts,
it's
only
--
it
was
only
after
caminito
and
bonino
had
become
the
beneficiary
for
this
good
fortune
that
noia
bestirred
himself
into
action.
he
made
a
motion
in
the
county
court
which
was
the
original
trial
court
to
vacate
the
judgment
of
conviction
against
him.
caminito
made
a
more
or
less
contemporaneous
motion
not
only
to
vacate
the
judgment
that
had
already
been
done
but
to
dismiss
the
indictment
against
him.
the
matter
came
on
before
a
county
judge
and
on
some
basis
of
natural
justice
because
he
couldn't
find
any
reason
in
the
law
of
coram
nobis
or
any
such
avenues
of
relief
in
new
york,
the
county
judge
granted
the
motion.
that
is
to
say
he
vacated
the
judgment
as
to
noia
and
he
dismissed
the
indictment
as
to
caminito.
well,
we
took
an
appeal
to
the
appellate
division
which
reversed
and
then
the
appeal
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
think
it
is
significant
that
in
the
court
of
appeals,
judge
fuld
wrote
for
a
unanimous
court
the
opinions
which
your
honors
will
find
at
pages
4
and
5
of
my
brief
and
i
will
merely
summarize
them.
they
--
the
court
of
appeals
held
first,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
natural
justice.
the
criminal
justice
has
to
proceed
according
to
law,
and
the
laws
of
new
york
had
very
definite
rules
and
avenues
with
respect
to
matters
like
this.
and
secondly,
that
coram
nobis
which
in
new
york
has
merged
it
into
bloom
in
the
late
years
since
about
15
or
18
years
ago
in
the
historic
case
as
a
matter
of
lyons
against
goldstein,
coram
nobis
would
not
lie
because
coram
nobis
is
designed
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
the
court
a
matter
of
fact,
a
question
of
fact
not
known
to
the
court
or
the
defendant
at
the
time
the
judgment
was
entered.
here,
all
that
noia
was
saying
in
effect
--
i
didn't
take
an
appeal
although
i
could
have
taken
an
appeal
under
new
york
law
it's
unjust
to
keep
me
in
prison
when
my
codefendants
to
all
intention
and
purposes
are
out.
and
judge
fuld
wrote
the
opinion
which
is
i
say
your
honors
will
find
at
pages
4
and
5.
i
ask
you
to
consider
its
importance
in
this
aspect.
our
court
of
appeals
had
the
powerless
condition
of
noia
as
contrast
to
the
relative
freedom
of
his
codefendants
before
you.
they
are
men
at
the
same
time
that
they
are
judges
but
they
refused
to
depart
from
the
law
of
new
york,
the
law
of
coram
nobis
and
the
nonexistent
law
of
natural
justice
and
so
they
sustain
us
and
the
judgment
against
bonino
and
the
indictment
against
caminito
was
reinstated.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
you
mean
on
the
failure
to
appeal?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
i
--
we
submitted
to
the
district
court
and
then
to
the
second
circuit
court
the
record
of
the
original
trial
and
there,
practical
reversal
of
the
judgment
was
on
the
record
of
the
trial.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
there
was
no
hearing,
in
other
words,
on
section
2254
of
the
united
states
code.
now,
we
come
to
the
beginning
of
the
--
this
present
proceeding.
noia
sued
our
writ,
petitioned
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
--
i
think
it
was
in
the
northern
district
of
new
york.
i
opposed
it
by
an
affidavit
which
i
recited
the
background
of
the
facts
and
in
which
my
principal
point
was
that
the
district
court
should
not
and
in
fact
could
not
entertain
the
petition
because
of
noia's
basic
original
failure
to
avail
himself
of
the
right
of
appeal.
now,
that
came
on
before
judge
cashin
or
rather
in
the
southern
district.
and
judge
cashin
was
disturbed
by
the
situation
that
faced
him,
or
in
caminito
and
bonino
out.
and
judge
cashin
wanted
to
find
out
if
he
could
why
noia
had
not
appealed
and
so
he
ordered
a
hearing
on
that
question.
he
had
noia
brought
down
from
the
prison
and
we
had
a
hearing.
noia
took
the
stand
and
he
testified
that
he
didn't
appeal
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
he
testified
that
he
didn't
appeal
for
two
reasons
and
i
think
perhaps
your
honor,
i
--
we
can
give
you
his
reasons
tomorrow.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
may
it
please
the
court?
when
the
court
recessed
yesterday
afternoon,
i
had
reached
that
point
in
the
narrative
of
the
case
history
where
noia
had
presented
his
petition
for
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
district
court,
judge
cashin.
judge
cashin
expressed
a
desire
to
learn
if
it
were
possible,
exactly
why
noia
had
failed
to
appeal
from
the
original
judgment
of
conviction.
and
so
a
hearing
was
ordered
and
held.
and
noia
was
brought
down
from
the
prison
and
testified
in
his
own
behalf.
and
in
substance,
he
testified
that
he
refrained
from
appealing
because
he
had
exhausted
his
funds
and
his
family's
funds,
and
he
didn't
want
to
give
further
burden
on
them.
and
he
also
testified
that
he
did
not
know
that
he
had
the
right
to
apply
to
the
appellate
division
for
permission
to
appeal
as
a
poor
person
and
that
upon
a
showing
of
merit,
the
application
would
be
granted.
new
york
called
mr.
louie
walker,
who
had
been
noia's
trial
counsel
and
mr.
walker
testified
that
he
visited
noia
in
the
jail
before
noia's
commitment
to
the
prison
during
the
30-day
period
in
which
a
notice
of
appeal
could
be
filed.
he
told
noia
that
caminito
and
bonino
had
or
were
going
to
appeal.
he
suggested
to
noia
that
he
should
appeal.
he
expressed
his
opinion
that
upon
such
an
appeal,
the
chances
for
reversal
were
very
good
and
he
offered
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal
in
noia's
behalf.
i
asked
him
why,
if
he
knew,
why
noia
finally
decided
not
to
appeal,
and
his
answer
in
substance
was
this;
that
while
they
discussed
several
reasons,
the
real
reason
was
that
noia
did
not
want
to
run
the
risk
of
a
reversal,
a
new
trial,
and
perhaps
a
less
clement
verdict
at
the
hands
of
a
jury
and
judgment
at
the
hands
of
the
court.
they
had
been
contemporaneously
in
brooklyn
a
case
of
a
defendant
named
hull,
who
had
been
convicted,
who
had
appealed
from
a
life
sentence,
who
had
won
a
retrial,
who
had
been
reconvicted,
and
who
had
been
executed
and
the
hearing
rested
in
that
condition.
judge
cashin
rendered
his
decision
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
precisely.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
actually
on
the
appeal
by
bonino
and
caminito,
there
were
--
there
was
one
or
perhaps
more
errors
urged
in
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
and
the
judgment
was
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
section
542
of
our
code
of
procedure,
which,
criminal
procedure,
which
authorizes
the
appellate
court
to
render
judgment
regardless
of
any
error
which
does
not,
in
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
court,
affect
the
substantial
rights
of
the
defendant.
it
may
very
well
be
that
mr.
walker's
opinion
was
based
on
the
existence
of
that
error
or
those
errors.
and
i
think
your
honors
will
realize
that
where
there
is
an
error
of
law
in
a
record,
no
lawyer
is
so
gifted
with
the
gift
of
prophecy
that
he
can
tell
that
the
appellate
court
will
say,
“this
is
or
it
is
not
a
substantial
error
under
section
542.”
at
the
moment,
your
honor,
i
really
don't
remember
what
the
error
was,
and
if
i
may
say
so,
for
the
purposes
of
this
argument
it's
not
material.
the
point
is
that
an
experienced
lawyer
and
the
record
discloses
that
mr.
walker
was
experienced
in
the
criminal
law,
told
noia
that
in
his
judgment,
there
was
good
chance
of
a
reversal.
now,
when
judge
cashin
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
your
honor,
i
was
just
about
to
come
to
that.
judge
cashin
refrained
from
making
any
findings
of
fact.
although,
i
think
when
you
read
the
record,
you
will
agree
that
if
it
had
been
necessary,
if
he
had
felt
it
to
be
necessary
to
make
findings
of
fact,
he
would
have
found
that
this
was
the
reason
for
noia's
refraining
from
appeal.
that
is
clear
from
his
opinion.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
my
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
that
i
never
thought
it
was
necessary
for
judge
cashin
to
find
this
fact;
that
under
the
statute
itself,
under
section
2254,
and
all
the
cases
before
it
culminating
in
ex
parte
hawk
and
all
the
cases
after
that.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
wasn't
it
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right
and
i
can
only
repeat,
your
honor,
that
i
didn't
then
think
and
i
don't
now
think
that
that
was
an
issue
relevant
to
the
issue
of
law
before
judge
cashin.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
judge
cashin
refrained
from
making
a
finding
because
as
he
expressed
it
in
his
opinion
on
the
reasoning
in
the
authority
cited
above
and,
of
course,
he
had
reviewed
all
of
the
cases
and
the
statute.
i
feel
constrained
to
dismiss
the
writ
because
of
relator's
failure
to
exhaust
his
state
court
remedies.
in
other
words,
he
decided
it
purely
as
a
question
of
law.
he
granted
noia
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
the
case
came
to
the
second
circuit,
the
legal
aid
was
assigned
and
mr.
polsky
represented
the
noia
and
presented
the
arguments
in
his
behalf.
and
he
presented
them
with
a
depth
of
a
scholarship
and
breadth
of
research
and
the
clarity
of
expression
which
i'm
sure,
your
honors
will
immediately
know
as
soon
as
he
addresses
this
court
and
i
enjoyed
his
presentation
for
two
reasons.
first,
because
it
was
an
intellectual
treat
to
listen
to
him
and
secondly,
because
i
was
wrapped
around
with
the
sense
of
perfect
confidence
in
the
result.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
issue,
as
he
presented
it,
could
not
be
successful
because
his
argument
really
amounted
to
this;
that
section
2254,
when
it
speaks
of
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies,
means
state
remedies
at
that
point
available
to
a
state
defendant.
whereas,
to
me
it
seemed
equally
clear,
in
fact
more
clear
that
2254
because
of
its
history
and
because
of
its
underlying
reason
meant
that
a
--
that
if
ever
there
had
been
a
state
remedy
available
to
a
defendant,
such
as
here
the
remedy
of
an
appeal
from
the
judgment,
it
had
been
incumbent
upon
the
defendant
to
exhaust
that
remedy
and
if
he
failed
for
any
reason,
except
the
interference,
let
me
say,
for
instance
by
the
state
authorities,
if
he
failed
to
exhaust
that
remedy,
he
was
irrevocably
and
forever
barred
from
seeking
to
end
to
the
federal
court.
the
issue,
i
thought,
was
as
simple
as
that.
well
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
sir.
if
your
honor
will
look
--
if
your
honor
will
look
at
the
note
immediately
above
on
that
page
after
stating
that
the
respondent
had
adduced
evidence
which
tends
to
show
that
the
relator
has
motive
for
not
appealing,
might
well
have
been
the
fear
that
on
a
retrial
the
death
penalty
might
be
imposed.
judge
cashin
said,
“i
prescend
from
making
any
finding
on
the
issue
since
i
think
it
is
entirely
unnecessary.”
in
other
words
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
prescend,
i
am
very
sure
means,
i
refrain.
it's
the
only
instance
in
which
i
ever
heard
it
used,
but
i'm
sure
it
means,
i
refrain.
in
other
words,
he
commented
upon
the
evidence,
but
he
made
no
formal
judicial
findings
of
fact
and
he
decided
the
matter
purely
on
the
issue
of
law.
well,
as
i
say,
we
had
the
argument
in
the
second
circuit
and
being
so
secure
in
my
confidence
of
ultimate
victory,
and
in
the
righteousness
and
reasonableness
of
my
position,
i
thought
that
we
would
get
a
relatively
speedy
determination
from
the
second
circuit.
well,
it
took
10
months
for
that
court
to
decide
this
matter
by
a
divided
court
with
a
very
vigorous
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
moore.
and
whenever
i
had
occasion
in
the
intervening
months
to
think
about
the
matter
and
it
wasn't
very
frequent
because
i
live
a
very
busy
life,
i
began
to
realize
that
this
passage
of
time
boded
no
good
for
the
case
of
the
state
of
new
york.
and
i
was
not
surprised
when
ultimately
the
unfavorable
decision
did
come
down.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
i
think
what
judge
moore
meant
by
that
was,
that
the
majority
of
the
court
shouldn't
decide
the
law
of
question
on
the
basis
of
noia's
polis
situation
when
he
had
to
make
this
decision
without
having
a
finding
of
fact
from
the
district
court
on
that
issue,
but
i
also
submit
that
judge
moore
upheld
that
the
issue
was
only
a
question
of
law.
well,
i
pass
now
your
honors
to
the
reasons
given
by
the
majority
for
their
decision,
and
i
shall
be
very
brief
in
my
analysis
of
them
for
several
reasons.
first,
is
that
i
really
don't
understand
the
reasons;
and
secondly,
i
don't
believe
they're
material
to
this
issue;
and
thirdly,
and
because
the
majority
of
the
second
circuit
didn't
really
decide
the
case
on
any
one
of
the
grounds,
which
it
discussed
so
fully
in
this
very
lengthy
opinion.
for
instance;
the
majority
wrote
on
the
question
of
waiver
and
it
said
in
substance,
that
noia
did
not
or
had
not
waived
his
right
not
to
be
convicted
on
the
basis
of
a
coerced,
and
therefore
illegal,
and
unconstitutional
confession.
well
actually,
that
wasn't
the
question
of
waiver
that
was
involved;
no
defendant
ever
waives
that
right.
he
goes
to
trial
with
the
right,
the
protection
surrounding
him
that
he
shall
not
be
subjected
to
the
use
and
effect
of
such
a
confession.
the
question
of
waiver
that
was
involved
was:
did
noia
or
had
noia
waved
his
right
to
appeal
from
such
a
judgment?
and
as
i
read
the
opinion
after
having
discussed
the
question
of
waiver,
the
majority
in
effect
said
that
they
were
not
deciding
the
case
on
that
basis.
then
they
passed
to
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
now,
it
was
incumbent
upon
noia
to
convince
that
court,
that
section
2254,
when
it
speaks
of
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies,
means
remedies
now
available
to
a
state
defendant.
that
if
now
there
is
no
remedy,
he's
entitled
to
the
federal
writ
and
concededly
there
was
no
longer
any
remedy
available
to
noia
in
new
york
because
the
court
of
appeals
through
judge
fuld
in
the
opinion
which
i
have
in
my
brief
had
said
the
coram
nobis
was
not
available
and
that
there
was
no
such
doctrine
as
abstract
natural
justice
to
which
he
could
address
himself.
and
as
i
read
the
opinion
of
the
majority,
they
did
not
decide
the
case
on
that
issue.
and
then
they
passed
to
another
point
and
discussed
but
did
not
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
there
was
present
and
adequate
--
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
of
decision.
actually,
the
opinion
of
the
majority
is
based
on
language
which
your
honors
will
find
at
page
28
of
my
brief.
and
i
would
like
to
read
because
it
seems
to
me
that
it
sums
up
the
reasoning,
with
great
deference
to
the
court,
i
think
i
should
say
the
emotion
rather
than
the
reasoning
of
the
second
circuit
which
is
the
basis,
the
real
basis
of
this
decision.
after
having
written
some
30
pages
or
so
of
an
opinion
raising
three
different
grounds
and
then
veering
away
from
it,
the
majority
wrote,
“thus
we
come
to
the
last
scene
in
this
human
drama.
is
there
an
adequate
state
ground
in
this
case
dooming
relator
to
life
imprisonment?
our
answer
is
no.”
the
state
ground
here
is
inadequate.
we
must
realize
that
adequacy
is
a
term
of
relativity.
no
state
ground
is
entitled
to
unqualified
deference.
as
we
noted
in
the
last
paragraph
for
the
state
ground
to
be
adequate,
it
must
be
reasoned
and
i
can
best
answer
that
in
words
of
judge
moore
in
his
dissent.
i
don't
think
i
or
anybody
else
could
improve
on
his
answer.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
judge
moore
gave
a
complete
answer
when
he
said
or
when
he
wrote,
thus
the
majority
has
and
he
quotes
them,
“come
to
the
last
scene
in
this
human
drama,
dooming
relator
to
life
imprisonment.”
legal
principles
having
failed
to
produce
the
desired
result,
resort
must
be
had
to
a
tour
de
force
by
the
fear
that”,
then
he
quotes
again,
“no
state
ground
is
entitled
to
unqualified
deference
and
adequacy
in
any
event
is
but
a
term
of
relativity.
after
all
for
the
state
ground
to
be
adequate,
it
must
be
reasonable
and
what
could
be
more
unreasonable
than
requiring
a
defendant
to
appeal.
and
this,
your
honors,
is
a
case
in
a
nutshell.
new
york
had
provided
a
ground
of
relief
for
noia
as
it
has
for
every
defendant.
i
--
while
in
those
days
antedating
griffin
against
illinois,
the
appellate
division
reserved
to
itself
the
right
to
require
of
an
appealing
of
an
indigent
defendant
that
he
showed
some
merit
which
he
does
not
do
today.
i
can
say
to
your
honors,
from
my
experience
that
in
a
case
involving
life
imprisonment,
it
is
to
me
inconceivable
that
if
noia
had
made
an
application
for
leave
to
dispense
with
printing
and
to
appeal
as
a
poor
person,
that
the
appellate
division
would
have
denied
that
application.
they
would
have
granted
it
as
a
matter
of
cause
because
of
the
severity
of
the
punishment.
and
therefore,
as
judge
moore
says,
and
he
says
it
with
his
judicial
tongue
and
his
judicial
cheek,
what
could
be
more
unreasonable
than
requiring
a
defendant
to
avail
himself
of
a
right
of
appeal.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
your
honor.
noia
--
i
asked
the
court
to
believe
me
that
if
noia
had
made
the
application
to
the
appellate
division,
he
would
have
been
granted
the
right
and
the
transcript
would
have
been
had,
and
if
necessary,
he
would
have
had
counsel
assigned
to
him.
it
all
rests
within
the
discretion
of
the
appellate
division
and
it
was
a
discretion
which
i
am
confident
would
have
been
employed
in
his
exercising
his
faith.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
our
statute
provides
that
when
a
case
is
retried
after
an
appeal,
it
is
as
though
the
first
trial
had
not
taken
place.
that
disposes
of
every
question
of
double
jeopardy
and
so
on.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
that's
our
rules
in
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
it
was
a
murder
case.
jury
recommended
clemency.
court
followed
the
recommendation,
imposed
a
judgment
of
life
imprisonment.
hull
took
an
appeal.
it
reversed
and
with
very
serious
and
untoward
consequences
to
follow
on
the
retrial.
what
the
form
of
the
grounds,
i
mean
what
facts
were,
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
now,
i
have
only
one
more
point
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
if
i
understand
your
honor,
my
answer
would
be
that
no
matter
what
the
language
is
in
which
the
majority
couched
this
principle,
the
real
content
of
the
language
and
the
decision
is
expressed
in
this
human
drama,
human
drama
aspect
of
the
opinion.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yeah,
and
then
they
went
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
that
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
it's
based
on
the
nature
of
the
specific
facts
in
any
specific
case.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
know
of
any
such
statute,
your
honor,
and
i'm
very
confident
that
there
is
no
such
statute.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right
and
i
think
that
the
majority
should
have
not
made
a
decision
in
that
aspect
of
the
case
purely
on
the
basis
of
noia's
polis
condition
and
as
i
contend
in
the
phase
of
the
express
language
of
section
2254,
and
the
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that
is
the
statute
which
regulates
the
procedure.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
it
does
not.
no
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
it
does
not.
that
is
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
don't
know
sir,
there
is
not.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
but
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that
is
correct
and
that
leads
me
to
my
last
point
which
is
an
answer
in
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
know,
your
honor.
all
i
know
are
the
four
corners
of
section
2254,
which
says;
no
man
shall
come
in
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
who
hasn't
exhausted
his
state
remedies.
and
as
i
say,
i'm
coming
to
my
last
point
which
is
really
an
answer,
an
anticipatory
answer
to
the
argument
that
mr.
polsky
is
going
to
make.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
go
right
ahead,
sir.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
he
has
exhausted
it
in
the
sense,
in
the
realistic
sense
that
there
is
no
state
remedy
but
he
has
not
exhausted
it
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
to
put
it
in
another
fashion,
your
honor,
exhaustion
here
is
a
term
of
odd.
it
has
a
very
definite
legal
meaning.
it
does
not
represent
just
the
state
of
facts.
it
represents
a
legal
procedure.
now,
in
that
sense,
he
has
not
exhausted
it.
in
the
realistic
sense,
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
is
nowhere
for
him
to
go
in
the
courts
of
a
state,
that's
so,
but
our
position
is
that
the
factual
aspect,
harsh
as
it
is
and
maybe
unpleasant
to
contemplate
as
it
is
to
everybody,
to
me
no
less,
me
as
a
prosecutor
no
less
than
to
mr.
polsky
or
to
this
court
or
any
other
court,
there
are
reasons
and
i
will
state
them.
they've
been
stated
time
and
again
by
this
court,
there
are
reasons
why
this
should
be
so.
the
last
point
in
mr.
polsky's
brief
is
a
plea
to
this
court
that
the
rule
in
brown
against
allen
should
be
overruled.
in
other
words,
that
the
doctrine,
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
should
be
wiped
out
of
the
--
of
the
cases
and
i
submit
the
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
that
is
what
mr.
polsky
would
like,
your
honors,
to
substitute
in
place
of
all
the
cases
which
have
been
decided
up
to
this
point,
which
uphold
my
position.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
you'll
find
in
the
treat,
your
honor.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
have
to
say
again,
your
honor,
that
the
use
of
the
word
‘exhaustion'
in
that
context
is
an
inaccurate
use
of
the
word.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
there
is
no
present
remedy
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no
remedy.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
concede
that.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
that's
right
and
that
this
court,
heretofore,
before
the
statute
which
is
a
codification
of
the
law
laid
down
before
its
enactment
and
since
the
statute
has
ruled
in
the
fashion
in
which
i
now
say
is
the
law
and
for
a
reason
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh,
i
concede
that
if
the
prison
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
your
honor,
i
have
conceded.
i
will
do
so
again
that
if
for
instance
the
prison
authorities
had
prevented
noia
from
sending
in
his
notice
of
appeal
and
filing
it
within
the
statutory
30
days,
there
isn't
a
court
in
the
world
and
i'm
certain
this
court
or
any
federal
court,
or
the
courts
of
new
york
would
have
not
prevented
him
from
doing
so.
we
are
today
adjudicating
that
in
new
york.
we
are
opening
up
coram
nobis
so
that
the
defendant
can
come
down,
prove
that
the
prison
authorities
have
prevented
him
from
filing
a
timely
notice
of
appeal,
vacating
that
judgment,
entering
a
new
judgment
so
that
the
statute
can
run
--
start
to
run
again.
of
course,
i
don't
suggest
any
such
thing,
but
i
do
submit
that
the
act
which
prevents
the
taking
of
the
timely
appeal
must
not
be
the
choice
of
the
defendant.
it
must
be
something
forced
upon
him
by
someone
who
has
authority
over
it.
now
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
mr.
polsky
will
be
unable
to
show
you
any
good
reason
why
the
rule
should
be
changed.
first
of
all,
to
change
it
would
be
to
do
violence,
i
think
i
submit
to
the
statute
itself.
it
would
be
an
act
of
judicial
legislation
which
i
don't
think
this
court
should
or
would
do.
secondly,
it
would
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
i
didn't
concede
that
i
said
he
didn't
intend
to,
i
say
that's
mr.
polsky's
argument.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
behalf
of
a
person
in
custody,
et
cetera,
shall
not
be
granted
unless
it
appears
that
the
applicant
has
exhausted
the
remedies
available.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
there
is
when
you
read
the
statute
in
the
light
of
say
brown
against
allen.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
oh,
you
mean
the
language
of
the
statute?
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
william
i.
siegel
well,
i
would
have
to
say
that
mr.
polsky
makes
a
good
argument
to
the
contrary,
let's
put
it
that
way.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
if
i
understand,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
so.
but
to
me
even
more
important
than
the
language
of
the
statute
is
the
reason
why
the
statute
was
enacted.
the
reason
why
all
of
the
cases
before
the
enactment
were
decided
the
way
they
were
and
the
reason
why
all
of
the
cases
thereafter
were
decided
the
way
we
are.
this
doctrine
is
a
recognition
of
the
federal
nature
of
this
nation,
of
the
independent
sovereignty
of
the
50
states,
of
their
right
within
that
sovereignty
to
enforce
their
own
laws
as
long
as
those
laws
do
not
violate
some
provision
of
the
constitution,
and
as
long
as
they
do
not
seek
to
enforce
a
right
which
they
have
ceded
to
the
federal
government.
now
it
has
been
very
clearly
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
nation
that
one
of
the
rights
of
a
state
is
to
enforce
its
own
criminal
law
and
all
of
the
decisions,
i
must
stop,
your
honor,
because
i
agreed
to
give
five
minutes
to
the
attorney
general.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
yes,
all
the
decisions
show,
they
picture
an
intent
on
the
part
of
this
court
to
respect
the
state
sovereignty.
to
change
the
rule
of
brown
against
allen
now
would
be
to
impinge
upon
that
rule
for
no
good
reason.
because
the
only
reason
which
is
advanced
is
the
hardship
now,
a
very
serious
hardship
now
worked
upon
noia.
and
my
answer
to
it
is
that
this
is
a
hardship
not
imposed
upon
him
by
the
state
of
new
york,
but
imposed
upon
himself;
suffered
because
of
his
own
voluntary
choice.
mr.
william
i.
siegel
no,
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
value
the
opportunity,
but
i
have
nothing
to
add
upon
the
previous
--
