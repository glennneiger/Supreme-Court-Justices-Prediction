[inaudible]
justice

and
you
wouldn't
[inaudible]
justice
byron

white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
polsky,
don't
you
--
in
that
connection
don't
you
have
to
ask
this
court
to
[inaudible]
darr
versus
burford
or
at
least
limit
it
to
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
well
let
me
put
it
this
way,
when
darr
against
burford
if
â€“
if
a
defendant
or
convicted
man
that
doesn't
as
much
here
for
certiorari
or
he
may
not
go
to
the
federal
court
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
right
--
alright,
let's
assume
he
didn't,
assume
he
didn't
and
then
he
goes
to
federal
court
for
habeas
corpus
at
a
time
when
certiorari
is
no
longer
available
of
the
times
gone
by.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
therefore
hasn't
this
court
already
in
the
name
of
the
exhausting
state
remedy
already
construed
that
fact,
2254
to
mean
that
you
want
--
that
you
have
not
exhausted
state
remedy,
that
you
did
fail
to
exhaust
a
remedy
that
was
once
available
but
it
is
not
available
now.
you
say
that
the
statute
must
be
construed
to
being
that
you've
exhausted
state
remedies,
that
there
is
not
a
remedy
that's
available
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
arguing
darr
against
burford
it
seems
to
me
would
indicate
that
this
court
feels
it
should
be
reversed?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
nevertheless
darr
against
burford
is
in
the
name
of
exhausting
of
state
remedies?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
applies
even
though
certiorari
is
no
longer
available?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
would
be
no
different
exception
than
would
apply
to
the
failure
to
take
an
appeal
in
the
state
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
why
--
why
do
you
make
the
argument
then
that
it
really
it
didn't
hurt
new
york,
doesn't
hurt
new
york
for
federal
habeas
to
operate
in
this
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could've
reversed
on
the
state
ground.
it
is
said
there
was
a
major
error
of
state
law
in
the
record
they
would
have
reached
the
constitutional
question.
wouldn't
he
even
one
of
those
[inaudible]
you
say
there
is
nothing
that
new
york
could
have
done
except
reverse
on
the
coerced
confession
point,
but
now
you
say
that
there's
plenty
that
new
york
could
--
that's
there
are
plenty
that
new
york
could
have
--
there's
plenty
of
other
state
errors
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
--
what
do
you
say
he
gave
up?
what
was
the
error
made
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
was
a
--
this
was
then
made
of
what
intimately
related
to
whether
there
was
a
coerced
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
fact
why,
why
do
this
--
why
would
the
appellate
court
do
the
jury's
work
there?
reverse
on
the
evidence
and
send
it
back
and
let
the
jury
decide
whether
the
coercion
--
the
confession
was
coerced
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
would
have
made
it
more
likely
that
the
jury
would
have
found
that
the
confession
would
be
coerced?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
why
would
the
appellate
court
agree
without
--
without
sending
it
back
for
the
jury
to
decide
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
give
up
anything
by
not
appealing
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
said
he
gave
up
something
on
it,
he
didn't
appeal
though[inaudible]
coerced
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
irrelevant
because
you
say
it
in
the
long
run,
the
coerced
confession
had
to
be
--
it
had
to
be
found.
the
confession
had
to
be
found
to
be
coerced.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
but
that
--
you
have
a
lot
trouble
with
that
kind
of
a
rule
because
it
has
entered
into
an
appeal,
the
state
court
might
have
decided
that
the
confession
was
coerced?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
appeal
so
he
did
the
state
out
of
the
chance
of
correcting
this
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
just
--
i'm
not
saying
whether
it
should
be
or
not.
i'm
just
saying
that
some
difficulty
in
the
major
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
it
would
in
spencer,
they
lost
the
opportunity
to
do
a
statute
whether
there'd
be
any
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
get
--
but
the
state
law
was
--
