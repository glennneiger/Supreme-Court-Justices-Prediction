mr.
joseph
j.
rose
may
it
please
the
court.
the
attorney
general
of
new
york
has
filed
a
brief
in
which
as
amicus
curiae
in
which
we
have
urged
a
reversal
of
the
order
of
the
circuit
court.
i
don't
want
to
cover
the
same
ground
that
the
district
attorney
has
covered
so
adequately.
there
are,
however,
one
or
two
facts
which
i
think
i
might
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
the
trial
record
shows
at
the
time
noia
was
sentenced,
trial
judge
had
some
difficulty
in
accepting
the
recommendation
of
mercy
that
the
jury
made.
he
said
to
noia
on
the
day
of
sentence,
“in
substance,
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
accept
this
mercy
recommendation.
you've
been
before
me
on
three
separate
occasions
of
robbery.
to
my
mind
you
are
a
cold-blooded
killer
and
i
know
that
you
committed
this
crime,
but
it
wasn't
until
this
morning
when
my
wife
spoke
to
me
at
the
breakfast
table
and
i
finally
decided
to
accept
the
jury's
recommendation
and
grant
you
mercy.”
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
now,
the
hearing
before
the
district
court,
before
judge
cashin,
showed
that
apparently
noia
was
aware
of
this
reluctance
in
the
part
of
the
trial
court
to
accept
this
recommendation
and
noia
apparently
had
this
in
mind
when
he
spoke
with
his
trial
counsel.
and
i
think
the
record
before
the
trial
court
--
district
court
clearly
shows
that
noia
made
an
intelligent
decision
not
to
prosecute
his
appeal.
i
think
under
all
the
circumstances
it
was
a
smart
thing
on
his
part.
now,
while
it's
true
that
the
district
court
made
no
findings
of
fact,
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
pointed
out
in
the
opinion
at
page
63
of
the
record,
the
district
court
said
this,
“i
had
thought
that
perhaps
a
hearing
on
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
relator's
failure
to
appeal
might
reveal
some
exceptional
circumstances
which
would
excuse
the
lack
of
indication
of
ordinary
appellate
procedure.”
the
hearing,
however,
utterly
failed
to
reveal
any
such
circumstance.
now,
i
think
that
mr.
siegel
has
covered
the
question
of
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
and
certainly
the
dissenting
opinion.
judge
moore,
i
think
covers
that
more
adequately
than
i
could
but
we
are
concerned,
so
far
as
the
attorney
general
is
involved,
specifically
with
section
2254.
i
would
not
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
federal
district
court
is
absolutely
barred
by
the
failure
to
exhaust
state
remedies.
some
of
us,
i
think,
had
come
to
feel
that
this
is,
perhaps,
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
federal
habeas
corpus;
i
don't
take
that
position.
i
do
feel,
however,
that
the
court
was
--
the
circuit
court
was
incorrect
in
holding
that
these
circumstances
in
this
case
are
so
exceptional
that
the
man
is
entitled
to
invoke
federal
habeas
corpus.
i
see
nothing
so
exceptional
in
this
particular
case.
i
don't
think
the
circumstances
are
what
have
been
meant
in
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
those
circumstances
have
usually
been
some
interference
by
state
officials
with
the
appellate
procedure,
some
incapacity
on
the
part
of
the
prisoner.
the
record
here
shows
that
the
prisoner
was
advised
by
counsel.
he
made
an
intelligent
and
knowing
decision
not
to
appeal.
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
he
properly
should
be
barred
from
invoking
federal
habeas
corpus.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
i
don't
think
it's
a
matter
of
power,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
a
--
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
i
would.
i
think
the
question
is
the
propriety
of
the
exercise.
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
no,
no.
but
i
think
--
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
i
would
hate
to
think
that
the
federal
court
would
have
not
the
power.
i
think
the
question
in
this
case,
was
it
proper
exercise
of
the
power
under
all
the
circumstances
in
the
case?
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
that's
correct,
we
had
consented.
we
made
known
our
objections
right
from
the
start.
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
well,
i
think
that's
a
question
separate
and
apart
from
section
2254,
and
i
think
that
you
have
--
there's
no
statutory
provision,
but
i
think
that
the
knowing
failure
to
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
conviction
without
any
excuse
should
be
considered
an
adequate
state
ground.
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
well,
your
honor,
i'll
note
that
there's
been
a
stipulation
between
the
district
attorney
and
mr.
polsky,
that
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
the
confession
should
be
considered
coerced.
and
i
feel
that
i
must
abide
by
that
stipulation
although
i
do
feel,
in
response
to
your
honor's
question
that
a
completely
different
case
could
made
out
for
noia's
confession.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
i
may
add
just
one
more
thing;
i
should
note
that
the
circuit
court
held
that
noia
took
the
stand
and
repudiated
his
confession
on
the
stand.
now,
this
is
not
so,
i
read
that
record
three
times.
noia
never
took
the
stand
and
never
repudiated
his
confession.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
well,
normally
we
wouldn't
be
brought
into
that
proceeding,
but
i
would
say
this
that
we
would
not
object
to
it.
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
well
i
would
take
the
position
simply
out
of
a
feeling
that
probably
just
interest
of
the
judgment
would
be
served.
frankly,
i
think
that
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
his
confession
was
coerced.
i'm
not
completely
convinced
that
it
was,
but
since
the
district
attorney
who
has
the
job
of
prosecuting
these
people
is
willing
to
concede
that
clemency
should
be
granted,
i
would
have
no
objection.
our
position
in
the
attorney
general's
office
is
mostly
civil
rather
than
criminal.
if
the
district
attorney‘s
content
to
go
along
with
the
executive
clemency,
we
should
deal
the
same
way.
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
the
circuit
court,
the
majority
put
it
in
this
way.
it
does
not
sit
well
on
the
consciences
of
civilized
men
that
two
of
the
codefendants
should
be
free
--
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
the
circuit
court
apparently
made
no
conclusions
specifically.
mr.
joseph
j.
rose
that's
correct.
