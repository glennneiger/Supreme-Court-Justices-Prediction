i
suppose
noia
is
taking
an
appeal
in
other
words
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
sustain
it
but
noia
have
to
come
here
on
the
cert?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
your
concept,
is
it?
is
that
part
of
the
judicial
system?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ordinarily.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
word.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
indeed,
i
don't
know
mr.
polsky
why
you
don't
argue
that
the
very
fact
that
we
said
ordinarily,
only
ordinarily
there
so
many
other
exceptions
that
darr
versus
burford
they
weaken
it
up.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
certainly
is
an
indication
of
exhaustion
is
not
a
question
of
power,
but
only
of
discretion,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
we've
decided
anything
that
seems
to
me,
that's
what
darr
and
burford
mean.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
you're
suggesting
is
to
be
a
rule
of
discretion
in
the
ordinary
attribute
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
[inaudible]
discretionary
writ,
has
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[attempt
to
laughter]
surely,
ordinarily.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
you've
told
us
earlier,
you
thought
that
spencer
was
probably
rightly
decided,
namely
that
one
cannot
deliberately
and
captiously
refuse
to
employ
state
remedial
procedures,
and
go
into
federal
habeas
corpus.
that
there
are
some
limitations,
i
thought
you
said
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
not
urging.
well,
suppose
you
had
one,
suppose
this
were
a
situation
in
which
i
understand
your
argument
but
you
could
not
say
there
was
volition
in
this
instance
because
of
the
over
hanging
death
penalty,
but
suppose
that
we're
not
a
capital
case,
and
suppose
it
were
a
case
in
which
noia
had
just
deliberately
and
intentionally,
you
know
this
conviction
was
based
on
the
coerced
confession,
refused
to
follow
any
state
remedy
available
to
him,
choosing
instead
to
go
under
the
federal
habeas
corpus.
in
that
fact
situation,
would
he
be
entitled
of
federal
habeas
relief
with
even
though
his
convictions
were
based
on
the
coerced
confession?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
he
would
or
would
not
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i'm
assuming
--
i'm
assuming
a
case
in
which
he
had
the
coerced
confession
applied.
he
had
the
all
advice
in
the
world
and
all
the
opportunities
in
the
world
and
all
the
money
in
the
world
to
go
ahead
and
appeal
his
conviction,
but
he
deliberately
elected
not
to
â€“
appeal
it
not
because
he
had
any
overhanging
death
sentence
or
anything
else,
he
just
decided
he
didn't
want
to
go
through
the
appellate
process
in
the
new
york
courts
and
he
preferred
to
go
under
federal
habeas
corpus.
now,
this
is
on
the
assumption
that
his
confession
was
indeed
a
coerced
confession
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
that
circumstance,
do
you
think
he'd
be
entitled
to
federal
habeas
corpus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
that
comes
down
to
if
it
was
a
violation
of
a
federal
constitution
into
his
conviction
and
no
matter
what
he
may
do
about
the
state
remedial
procedures,
no
matter
how
of
much
or
what
reason
he
may
ignore
them,
he's
still
entitled
to
federal
habeas
relief.
