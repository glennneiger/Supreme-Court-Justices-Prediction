is
noia
represented
by
a
counsel
at
the
trial?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
at
the
time
of
the
appeal,
if
he
had
appealed?
or
was
it
--
he
had
the
advice
of
counsel
at
the
time
that
he
--
for
whatever
reason
it
was,
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
read
that
as
saying,
as
the
majority
--
the
court
of
appeals
saying
that
the
state
ground
principle
is
available
is
available
in
habeas
corpus
that
they
did
not
regard
the
state
ground
as
an
adequate
one?
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
there
any
[inaudible]
executive
clemency
for
this
man?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
understood
mr.
siegel
to
say
that
this
case
was
complicated
psychologically
at
least
or
emotionally
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
here
are
two
codefendants
who
are
out
and
that
therefore,
he
recognizes
or
the
district
attorney's
office
recognizes
that
and
although
constitutionally
he
is
arguing
that
there
is
no
justification
by
virtue
of
that
fact
to
release
noia,
there
is
human
confe
--
considerations
which
would
lead
the
district
attorney's
office
at
least
to
recommend
executive
clemency,
that's
what
i
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
unless
it
is
a
question
of
power,
the
federal
court
basically
to
act
in
this
situation,
i
think
the
statute
gives
federal
courts
power
to
act
only
if
the
man
is
being
held
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights.
the
question
--
the
basic
question,
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
or
not
the
state
of
new
york
having
said
that
do
not
having
appealed
and
followed
our
normal
procedure,
it
can
be
said
that
this
man
is
being
held
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
and
if
he
is
not
being
held
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights,
then
this
court
--
the
federal
court
have
got
no
power
to
act.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
entirely
different
question
from
the
question
of
exhaustion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
would
true
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
too?
justice
john
m.
harlan
under
our
law,
under
our
state
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
it
because
they
let
out
caminito
or
bonino
whichever
followed
first
after
the
other
got
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
talking
about
exhaustion?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
another
way
of
saying
it,
isn't
it,
the
united
states
law
not
an
adequate
one?
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
all
you're
saying
in
your
remedy
and
if
you
say
that
notwithstanding
that
this
is
so
calculably
the
conscience
however
you
want
to
put
it
as
it's
just
on
the
way
of
saying
that
you
will
not
tolerate
the
state
ground
and
bar
in
this
situation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
not
applicable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
failure
to
app
--
failure
to
appeal
is
then
a
basis
for
holding
him
assuming,
assuming
that's
it's
a
permissible
state
proceeding.
why
not?
in
other
words,
i
think
you
have
come
to
grips
with
this
question
from
my
point
of
view
when
you
recognize
that
ultimately
this
is
a
question
of
power
not
discretion,
the
question
of
power.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
you
have
to
argue,
and
it
seems
to
me
your
case
has
a
standard
wrong
on
one
or
two
propositions.
number
one,
either
that
the
adequate
state
ground
principle
does
not
apply
on
federal
habeas
corpus
in
any
--
in
any
type
of
case,
so
as
to
limit
is
a
matter
of
power
of
federal
jurisdiction,
or
you
got
to
argue
that
if
that
principle
does
obtain
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
what
would
otherwise
have
been
an
adequate
state
ground
becomes
inadequate.
justice
john
m.
harlan
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
argue
both.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
met
this
thing
head
on
and
very
important
arguing.
justice
john
m.
harlan
would
you
--
if
you
were
here
on
direct
review,
would
you
be
arguing
this
that
the
failure
to
appeal
is
not
an
adequate
state
ground,
if
you
were
here
on
direct
review?
justice
john
m.
harlan
direct
review
from
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
coram
nobis?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
would
assume
it
would
be
denied?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
so
we
are
restricted
by
the
(voice
overlap)
power.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
if
i
may
suggest
the
last
few
minutes,
mr.
polsky,
you've
been
arguing
this
adequate
state
ground
in
the
matter
as
if
it
were
a
discretionary
matter.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
if
it's
a
question
of
power
in
special
circumstances
that
don't
--
there's
no
room
for
their
operation,
if
it's
a
question
of
power.
any
more
than
judge
fuld,
who
would
certainly
bend
himself
in
this
situation
to
release
this
man
if
he
could
to
able
to
escape
the
inexorable
limitations
of
the
non-exist
power.
