justice
potter
stewart
new
york
has
no
preliminary
hearing
as
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
confession
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
before
the
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
was
pretty
clear
that
noia
was
the
triggerman?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
might
be
relevant
as
to
why
he
did
not
appeal.
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
have
a
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
even
if
that's
correct
though,
even
if
that's
correct,
that
doesn't
give
you
the
answer
to
this
case
because
exhaustion
and
an
adequate
state
ground
are
two
quite
separate
concepts,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
the
jury's
recommendation
is
not
binding
in
new
york?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
some
indication
in
the
--
excuse
me.
i'm
changing
the
subject;
there
is
some
indication
in
the
state
court
proceedings
in
the
appellate
division
of
coram
nobis
that
the
circumstances
surrounding
noia's
confession
were
different
from
those
which
surround
the
confessions
of
these
two
codefendants.
is
there
anything
in
that?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don't
think
the
suggestion
that
you
refer
to
has
been
made
by
counsel.
in
answer
to
my
question,
they
conceded
that
it's
been
stipulated
that
this
confession
was
coerced.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
could
have
filed
petition
for
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
daniels?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
polsky,
have
you
--
i
suppose
you
--
i
know
you've
given
a
more
thought
to
this
case
than
i
am,
certainly.
but
have
you
thought
of
casting
your
argument
in
quite
a
different
way
that
in
circumstances
such
as
we
have
here
with
a
conceded,
coerced
confession
and
with
the
two
compa
--
codefendants
having
been
released,
that
it
was
a
violation
of
due
process
in
the
part
of
the
state
of
new
york
not
to
provide
some
sort
of
corrective
procedure
in
these
circumstances?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
suppose
we
would
all
agree
that
there's
nothing
unreasonable,
certainly
nothing
violative
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
new
york
to
have
a
rule
that
they
give
you
a
reasonable
time
within
which
to
appeal
and
you
don't
appeal
within
that
time,
then
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
becomes
final
as
a
general
rule.
that's
certainly
the
rule
in
every
state
in
the
union
from
such
rule
and
also
i
suppose
we'd
all
concede
that
as
the
general
--
the
generality
that
new
york
can
limit
or
shape
its
post-conviction
remedies
as
it
wishes,
limiting
coram
nobis
for
example
to
newly
discovered
facts
as
the
judgment
as
it
wishes
to
do,
as
a
general
rule,
but
in
the
context
of
this
case
couldn't
the
argument
still
be
made
that
under
these
circumstances
that
new
york,
under
the
command
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
was
required
to
furnish
a
procedure
to
this
man
and
he
is
admittedly,
concededly
being
confined
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
couldn't
that
argument
be
made?
do
you
think
that's
a
stronger,
more
radical
argument
than
the
one
you
are
making?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
probably
is
--
perhaps
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
way
verbalizing
probably
--
justice
potter
stewart
extreme
way
of
verbalizing.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
let's
say
the
argument
taking
all
the
way
that
leads
to
--
that
leads
to
a
logical
one
and
honestly
incorrect
result,
it
seems
to
me.
let's
say
this
fellow
been
convicted
by
the
state
of
new
york
of
two
murders
and
has
given
two
concurrent
life
sentences
probably
two
separate
people
and
then
in
one
of
them
all
the
proof
against
him
--
the
only
proof
against
him
was
a
coerced
confession,
but
in
the
other
while
there
might
have
been
errors
under
state
law
there
was
no
violation
of
any
federal
constitutional
laws.
certainly,
a
federal
district
court
wouldn't
have
power
to
release
that
man,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
of
the
adequate
state
ground
that
was
keeping
him
in
there
for
a
life
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
why?
habeas
corpus
has
the
power
to
release
the
person.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn't
that
really
what
the
state
is
arguing
here?
that
is
an
analogous
thing.
it's
not
such
a
clear
case
but
the
--
what's
keeping
him
in
prison
is
his
failure
to
appeal
as
a
rule
of
state
law,
not
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
