why
do

justice

why
did
you
say
that
the

did
it
for
the
reason
that
you've
just
stated,
just
didn't
believe
there
was
constitutional
question
that
were
made?
justice

you've
asked
what?
justice

you
said
you
didn't
make,
do
we
have
to
reach

justice

well,
i
just
look
at
it
again.
my
memory
was
that
probably
it
wouldn't
have
to
reconsidered,
did
we
not
hold
it?
the
court
doesn't
know
about
what
he
said,
does
it,
failure
to
get
an
appeal,
[inaudible]
until
the
61st
day
noia's
[inaudible]
deprived
the
defendant
of
any
right
of
appeal
to
raise
his
custody
from
testimony?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
taken
for
what
is
held.
the
man
was
denied
the
right
to
test
his
constitutional
challenge
on
the
ground
that
his
lawyer
has
neglected
or
failed
for
reasons
set
out,
to
get
the
notice
the
prosecuting
attorney
until
the
61st
day.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
factors
--
the
fact
is
not
referred
to
by
the
court
in
its
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
a
few
words
spoken
in
the
sense
of
that
guard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
it
would
not
be
possible
to
choose
between?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
will
they
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
use
your
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
that
some
states
make
it
crime
no
to
issue
[inaudible]
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
polsky,
doesn't
your
argument
based
on
the
filing
of
have
come
down
very
much
as
it
was
presented
in
daniels
that
the
argument
which
was
made
in
williams
and
[inaudible]
where
there
is
a
flagrant
if
charged
and
shown
and
appeared
there
had
been
a
flagrant
denial
of
constitutional
rights
by
a
state
which
results
that
the
man
being
confined
unconstitutionally
that
by
the
state
does
not
afford
the
remedy
whatever
the
reason
the
habeas
corpus
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course,
the
dissent
was
based
on
what
it
actually
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
neglected
but
not
on
that
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
he'd
be
released
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
state
out
of
the
chance
of
relief,
the
relief
he
wants
to
get
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
siegel,
do
you
have
anything
that
you
want
to
say
after
lunch
or
you
could
--
your
time
is
up
but
you
needed
it
to
complete
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
mr.
polsky,
the
court
wants
to
express
its
thanks
to
you
for
the
excellent
manner
