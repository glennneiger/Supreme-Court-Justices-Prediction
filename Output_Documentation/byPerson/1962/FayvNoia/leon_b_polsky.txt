mr.
leon
b.
polsky
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
warden
petitioner
claims
that
the
new
york
state
procedural
rule
requiring
an
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
conviction
outweighs
the
federal
substantive
right
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
they
say
that
noia's
knowing
volitional
failure
to
appeal
and
those
are
fair
words
bars
him
from
proceeding
in
these
courts.
at
the
outset,
we
challenged
the
volition
--
the
volitionalness
of
the
failure
to
appeal
and
the
knowingness
of
the
failure
to
appeal.
at
the
time
of
noia's
conviction
under
the
theory
which
the
prosecution
has
advanced,
they
had
just
come
down
from
the
new
york
courts
a
decision
in
this
whole
case,
which
says
that
when
a
man
takes
an
appeal
in
a
noncapital
murder
case,
has
it
reversed,
he
goes
back
and
stand
trial
and
can
have
capital
punishment
imposed.
this
had
just
happened
in
the
same
court
immediately
prior
to
noia's
conviction.
as
mr.
rose
stated
the
trial
judge,
when
the
jury
brought
in
its
verdict
and
recommendation
of
mercy
as
to
all
three
defendants,
the
trial
judge
accepted
the
recommendation
as
to
caminito
and
bonino
but
reserved
decision
on
whether
he
would
accept
it
as
to
noia.
then
for
the
period
of
several
weeks
between
verdict
and
judgment,
noia
stayed
in
jail
not
knowing
whether
he
would
be
executed
or
whether
he
would
get
a
life
sentence.
on
the
day
of
sentence,
the
trial
judge
told
noia,
as
mr.
rose
has
stated,
“up
until
this
morning
i
was
going
to
send
you
to
the
electric
chair,
but
my
wife
convinced
me
to
change
my
mind.”
it
was
sometime
after
this,
with
these
considerations,
that
noia
had
trust
upon
him
the
awful
choice
of
whether
he
should
take
his
appeal
and
risk
his
life,
or
whether
he
should
sit
back
with
the
judgment
as
rendered.
he
knew
that
he
could
appeal,
i
concede
that.
whether
under
these
circumstances
as
the
petitioner
argues
this
was
volitional
question?
i
think
the
court
of
appeals,
although
there
were
no
specific
findings
of
fact
in
the
trial
court,
took
the
peoples'
theory
of
the
case
and
said
that
under
this
theory,
circumstances
surrounding
the
failure
to
appeal
add
up
to
circumstances
sufficient
enough
to
warrant
or
excusing
the
failure
to
appeal
and
therefore
we
will
sustain
a
writ
under
the
special
circumstances
doctrine.
the
court
applied
these
special
circumstances
to
each
of
three
separate
theories
which
have
been
advanced
at
one
time
or
another
as
the
basis
for
the
denial
of
federal
relief
to
state
prisoners.
while
we
feel
that
the
petitioner's
case,
the
facts
in
the
petitioner's
case
upon
which
he
relies
are
sufficient
to
sustain
the
court
below's
finding
that
sufficient
circumstances
warranting
the
issuance
of
the
writ
existed.
we
also
suggest
to
the
court
two
alternative
theories
upon
which
the
writ
can
be
sustained.
both
of
these
questions
relate
solely
to
the
question
of:
does
a
federal
court
have
the
power
to
issue
the
writ?
i
think
if
nothing
else
has
been
made
clear
by
the
opinions
below,
by
two
courts,
by
the
dissents,
by
the
arguments
today,
it
is
clear
that
if
this
is
a
case
where
--
if
there
is
the
slightest
room
for
power
to
be
exercised,
that
every
court
so
far
would
have
exercised
whatever
power
or
discretion
it
had
in
the
relator's
favor
and
issued
the
writ.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
said,
“we
do
not
have
the
power
to
release
this
man.”
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
under
state
law.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
correct,
your
honor
and
it
is
quite
possible
that
if
they
did
find
they
had
the
power,
anywhere
in
the
entire
corpus
of
new
york
law,
they
could
find
the
slightest
inherent
power
or
discretion,
they
would
have
exercised
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
judge
fuld's
opinion
says
that
caminito
and
that
caminito
had
appealed
and
then
followed
the
habeas
corpus
procedure
in
the
district
--
in
the
federal
courts.
and
then
he
said,
he
is
therefore
preserved
his
claims
or
words
to
that
effect
and
that
is
why
he
got
out.
i
don't
know
whether
he
intended
to
draw
some
distinction
between
caminito's
appeal
through
the
state
system
and
the
habeas
corpus
as
far
as
its
effectiveness
to
secure
release.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
he
makes
--
he
does
mention
it
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
whole
history
of
this
statute,
the
present
section
2241,
begins
with
the
1867
statute.
up
to
that
time,
even
though
there
is
a
constitutional
provision
which
provides
for
habeas
corpus
or
its
non-suspension,
except
in
certain
instances
up
until
that
time
it
had
been
held
by
this
court
that
the
federal
court
had
no
power
to
interfere
in
a
state
court
proceeding
unless
congress
passed
some
sort
of
enabling
legislation
to
implement
the
constitutional
provision.
such
a
statute
is
passed
in
1867.
it
was
passed
definitely
bearing
in
mind
the
then
proposed
reconstruction
legislation
and
the
proposed
fourteenth
amendment.
that
statute
has
said
not
a
word
about
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
it
had
no
limitation
to
it
except
federal
--
in
substance
that
federal
court
shall
issue
the
writ,
hear
the
case,
dispose
of
it
as
law
and
justice
requires
if
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
federal
right.
soon
afterwards
the
first
case
under
this
statute
arose,
which
set
forth
what
has
grown
up
to
the
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
ex
parte
bridges,
circuit
justice
bradley
reviewing
a
district
court
order,
sustaining
the
writ
for
a
georgia
defendant,
a
state
court
prisoner,
who
had
been
tried,
convicted
and
had
not
appealed,
the
court
said
that
a
federal
court
in
its
discretion
could
refrain
from
issuing
the
writ
prior
to
the
completion
of
the
entire
state
court
proceeding,
tried,
appealed
and
even
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
that
were
available.
the
case
clearly
rested
on
discretion,
for
in
that
case
the
writ
issued.
the
first
case
in
this
court,
ex
parte
royall
again
relying
upon
bridges
talks
in
terms
of
discretion
which
the
court
has
the
power
to
issue
the
writ.
it
is
discretion,
however,
which
makes
us
temporize
this
grant
of
power.
and
after
that,
another
series
of
cases,
all
following
bridges
and
royall
talking
in
terms
of
discretion
that
the
court
had
the
power
if
it
wanted
to.
the
first
case
which
seems
to
import
a
new
concept
beyond
this
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
discretion
is
i
believe
the
spencer
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1913.
in
that
case,
a
state
court
prisoner
deliberately,
knowingly
failed
to
appeal
from
his
state
court
conviction.
instead
he
brought
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding,
claiming
that
the
state
statute
under
which
he
had
been
convicted
was
unconstitutional,
having
ex
post
facto
sentencing
provisions.
this
court,
upon
review
or
upon
application
for
a
writ,
said
that
by
spencer's
failing
to
appeal
his
conviction,
he
injected
new
issues
into
the
case
because
had
he
appealed,
the
pennsylvania
court
could
have
construed
the
statute
in
such
a
manner
that
its
constitutionality
would
not
have
been
subject
to
attack.
furthermore,
the
pennsylvania
court
had
the
power
to
modify
the
pennsylvania
judgment
which
the
federal
court
did
not
think
it
had
at
that
time.
therefore,
by
spencer's
not
appealing,
he
sought
to
preclude
the
state
from
making
findings
which
would
have
sustained
his
judgment.
under
those
circumstances,
this
court
said
spencer
cannot
come
to
a
federal
court.
that
i
think
is
whether
it
is
a
decision
based
on
discretion
or
waiver
that
is
a
clear
example
of
a
situation
where
a
federal
court
should
not
entertain
a
writ
because
of
failure
to
appeal,
because
something
the
prisoner
has
done,
has
prejudiced
the
position
of
the
state.
here
our
case,
as
i
will
develop
i
hope,
is
that
we
have
done
nothing
to
prejudice
the
state;
that
the
only
party
to
this
litigation
was
unprejudiced,
he
responded
before
you.
after
spencer,
came
hawk,
where
this
court
again
repeated
the
history
dealing
with
the
exercise
of
discretion
and
power
under
the
exhaustion
statute.
in
that
case,
the
court
sent
the
defendant
back
to
exhaust
his
nebraska
remedies,
saying
that,
“we
think
there
is
a
nebraska
remedy
or
at
least
he
should
try
to
find
out
if
there
is
not.”
almost
immediately
after
the
hawk
decision,
the
statute
was
passed.
it
has
been
conceded
by
everyone
that
all
the
statute
intended
to
do
is
to
codify
existing
habeas
corpus
law
up
to
this
point.
now,
the
statute
included
as
its
first
provision,
almost
verbatim
what
had
been
in
the
1867
statute,
dealing
with
the
power
of
the
court
to
issue
the
writ,
and
then
there
were
some
procedural
provisions.
and
then
there
was
section
2254
which
had
never
been
part
of
the
statute
before
but
the
reviser's
notes
indicate,
it
was
intended
to
be
a
codification
of
everything
that
had
gone
before
dealing
with
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
we
say
that
the
statute
brought
in
all
of
these
decisions
saying
that,
as
far
as
the
district
court
is
concerned,
it
has
the
power
to
issue
the
writ
at
any
point
in
the
state
court
proceeding
but
under
the
doctrine
of
exhaustion
of
state
remedies,
it
should
abstain
from
the
exercise
of
that
jurisdiction
until
there
is
no
proceeding
left
to
be
had
in
the
state
court.
that
all
this
is,
is
a
doctrine
of
comity
between
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts
where
one
court
will
not
act
upon
a
litigation
while
the
other
court
has
or
could
reasonably
have
the
same
issues
before
it
in
a
related
litigation.
all
that
this
statute
was
intended
to
do,
i
submit,
was
to
say
to
a
federal
district
judge,
say
at
a
time
when
charles
noia's
appeal
was
pending
if
one
was
taken
wait
until
the
state
court
decides
the
case
and
see
what
they
do
with
it.
even
further,
say
he
had
not
brought
his
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
district
court
and
there
may
have
been
some
doubt
as
to
whether
coram
nobis
would
lie
in
new
york,
the
statute
says
to
the
district
judge,
“wait,
let
him
try
coram
nobis
in
new
york
and
maybe
new
york
will
pull
their
own
chestnut
out
of
the
fire.”
that
is
all
the
statute
did.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
exhaustion
solely,
your
honor.
it
was
not
until
brown
against
allen
that
the
court
possibly
deciding
it
on
a
basis
of
exhaustion
and
discretion,
possibly
deciding
it
on
the
basis
of
waiver
held
that
the
two
defendants,
named
daniels
are
not
appealing
from
their
conviction,
had
forfeited
their
right
to
claim
in
the
federal
courts
that
they
had
been
denied
due
process
of
law
in
the
state
courts.
i
think,
however,
in
order
to
fully
appreciate
the
significance
of
daniels,
we
must
first
look
to
the
record
in
daniels.
that
daniels'
record
shows
that
the
daniels
after
the
state
court
had
dismissed
their
appeal
stated
to
the
defendants
that
if
they
have
a
substantial
question
of
denial
of
right,
they
may
proceed
by
coram
nobis
in
the
north
carolina
courts,
and
that
is
what
the
daniels'
defendants
did.
they
brought
a
coram
nobis
proceeding
which
was
denied
on
the
merits
for
lack
of
a
substantial
question
by
the
north
carolina
court.
with
this
posture,
the
daniels
came
to
the
federal
court;
the
federal
court
held
a
hearing.
judge
gilliam
in
the
district
court
found
that
each
and
every
one
of
their
claims
was
completely
unsupported
both
by
the
state
court
record
and
by
the
hearing
which
we
--
he
had
held.
their
claim
of
coerced
confession
and
substance
boiled
down
to
the
fact
that
both
of
them
had
confessed
after
being
held
for
one
hour.
judge
gilliam
found
that
there
was
independent
evidence
aside
from
the
usual
accusations
and
denials
of
the
parties,
that
there
was
independent
corroborative
evidence
that
the
confessions
had
been
voluntary.
on
the
question
of
exclusion
of
members
of
the
defendants
raised
from
the
jury,
judge
gilliam
found
that
all
there
was
in
this
record
were
facts
from
which
an
inference
could
be
drawn
that
the
exclusion
--
that
there
had
been
a
deliberate
exclusion.
but
at
that
time,
as
evidenced
by
the
brown
and
speller
case,
the
companion
cases
of
the
daniels
against
allen,
an
inference
was
not
enough.
they
required
--
that
was
required
to
be
a
definite
proof
of
deliberate
exclusion
for
persons
of
the
defendants
raised
from
the
jury.
now,
it
very
well
may
be
that
fact
situations
in
daniels
at
the
time
of
their
conviction
might
today
be
considered
by
this
court
to
be
such
as
would
amount
to
a
denial
of
due
process.
i
submit
that
at
the
time
of
the
daniels'
case
that
the
opinion
of
this
court
as
to
the
merits
of
the
case
was
such
that
their
claims
was
so
insubstantial
that
they
barely
--
that
all
they
did
was
state
a
federal
question
but
not
prove
it.
under
those
circumstances,
the
court
refused
to
allow
habeas
corpus
to
issue.
this
court
affirming
the
denials
suggested
that
all
this
court
was
doing,
although
i
must
confess
there
is
language
to
the
contrary
in
the
court's
opinion,
was
saying
that
this
man
--
these
men
have
not
made
out
their
claims.
they
have
proved
nothing.
after
a
hearing,
after
looking
at
the
state
record,
they
have
just
made
out
nothing
and
therefore,
habeas
corpus
will
not
lie.
there
is
concededly
language
in
the
court's
opinion
which
talks
in
terms
of
waiver.
this,
i
submit,
is
the
only
decision
of
this
court
up
to
this
point
which
injects
the
concept
of
waiver
of
the
federal
substantive
right
by
failure
to
appeal
in
these
terms
into
a
habeas
corpus
litigation.
we
suggest
that
the
decision
in
brown
or
daniels
could
rest
very
easily
and
i
think
did
rest
very
easily
upon
the
ground
that
the
majority
of
this
court
just
did
not
appeal
that
the
claim
of
denial
of
federal
right
had
been
made
out.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
because
the
--
well,
starting
with
the
coerced
confession
--
why
do
i
say
--
what
that
i
don't
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
because
in
the
brown
and
speller
cases,
the
companion
cases
to
daniels,
the
same
question
regarding
exclusion
of
negroes
from
the
trial
and
grand
juries
had
been
raised.
and
the
issues
were
fra
--
framed
in
pretty
much
the
same
way
as
in
daniels.
and
i
think
from
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
brown
and
speller,
it
is
clear
that
as
to
daniels
had
the
court
specifically
wrote
an
opinion
on
the
merits
that
it
would
have
denied
it.
i'm
guessing,
i
grant
you
that,
your
honor.
incidentally,
there
was
misstatement
in
my
brief
where
i
say
that
daniels
had
an
all
white
jury,
that
is
not
so.
there
was
one
negro
on
the
trial
jury
that
convicted
him.
now,
the
court
in
daniels
and
the
language
which
the
petitioner
quotes
at
page
15,
the
language
which
--
is
the
language
which
suggests
forfeiture,
says
that,
“it
is
only
when
a
state
prisoner
is
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
constitution
that
the
statute
applies.”
that
fact
is
not
to
be
tested
on
habeas
corpus
[inaudible]
appeal.
we
don't
seek
to
test
any
facts
in
this
case.
we
come
here
with
a
complete
record,
with
only
issues
of
law,
with
conceded
facts,
and
with
the
conceded
ultimate
question
of
law
of
coercion.
we
are
not
trying
to
prove
anything
and
because
of
this,
because
all
of
the
facts
are
here
on
the
face
of
the
record,
we
seek
to
analogize
and
draw
together
this
whole
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
beginning
with
nielsen
down
to
bowen
against
johnson
stating
that
error
of
law
appearing
upon
the
face
of
the
record
is
not
waived
by
failure
to
appeal
when
the
error
goes
to
a
substantial
right
such
as
a
right
under
the
constitution.
and
we
seek
to
draw
this
in
to
the
habeas
corpus
situation
by
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
johnson
against
zerbst,
where
the
court
talks
in
terms
of
jurisdictional
defects,
of
jurisdiction
being
lost
in
the
course
of
the
trial
because
of
violation
of
a
fundamental
right
in
the
course
of
the
trial.
in
your
honors
--
mr.
justice
black's
opinion,
he
said
that
the
failure
to
assign
counsel
in
a
case
where
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
and
over
the
defendant,
caused
the
court
which
originally
had
jurisdiction
to
lose
the
power
to
proceed
to
judgment
in
such
a
situation.
that,
we
suggest,
is
the
basis
for
habeas
corpus
intervention
in
state
court
cases.
that
a
state
court,
somewhere
in
the
course
of
a
proceeding,
commits
an
error
so
gross
that
the
court
loses
the
power
to
proceed
to
judgment
and
that
the
judgment
which
it
renders
is
a
nullity
and
under
these
line
of
cases
the
loss
of
jurisdiction
is
never
waived
if
it
appears
affirmatively
on
the
face
of
the
record.
now,
it
is
suggested
here
that
despite
concession
that
perhaps
noia's
and
because
of
the
appellate
division
decision
that
noia's
case
is
a
little
less
strong
than
caminito
and
bonino.
the
horror
of
this
case
is
that
noia's
case
is
different.
it
is
considerably
different.
noia
is
the
only
defendant
who
was
able
to
produce
undisputed
evidence
that
he
was
beaten.
neither
caminito
nor
bonino
were
able
to
do
this.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
but
i
would
just
like
to
refer
to
one
item
of
testimony
in
the
record,
the
testimony
of
the
department
of
corrections'
position;
a
state
officer
who
examined
noia
the
day
after
he
was
arraigned
or
the
day
of
his
arraignment
which
was
the
day
after
he
had
been
released
by
the
police.
dr.
sparandino
testified,
“when
i
examined
him,
he
had
large
bruises
on
his
right
thigh.
he
had
some
contusions
at
the
scalp.
he
had
some
contusions
at
the
lower
posterior
chest
wall,
on
the
left
chest
wall.
complained
of
pain
in
the
stomach
and
said
he'd
been
kicked.
there
was
a
large
bruise,
a
black
and
blue
mark,
in
area
of
about
i
would
say,
about
two
or
three
inches
in
diameter.”
he
complained
of
a
few
injuries.
also,
his
codefendants,
caminito
and
bonino,
who
too
claimed
that
their
confessions
were
coerced
and
whose
lives
were
at
stake
in
this
proceeding,
testified
that
noia
had
been
far
more
badly
beaten
than
they
had.
this
case
is
different.
now,
up
through
brown
against
allen,
we
suggest
that
the
doctrine
of
adequate
of
state
grounds
has
played
no
part
in
a
habeas
corpus
litigation.
the
first,
as
far
as
i
can
find,
the
first
suggestion
of
it
appears
in
one
of
the
opinions
in
this
court
in
irvin
against
dowd.
the
court
below
treated
that
the
doctrine
of
adequate
state
grounds
is
being
applicable
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
but
in
so
treating
it,
it
also
found
there
were
circumstances
which
did
not
make
it
dispositive
to
the
case.
while
we
agree
with
the
court's
discussion
below,
we
wish
to
also
suggest
that
the
entire
period
of
adequate
state
grounds
has
no
application
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
that
the
theory
of
adequate
state
grounds
applies
only
to
this
court's
power
to
review
a
decision
which
comes
directly
from
the
state
court.
that
the
theory
of
adequate
state
grounds
first
laid
down
in
murdock
against
memphis
in
substance
hold
that
this
court
is
not
going
to
take
a
case
which
it
can't
decide
or
where
it
can't
decide
the
result.
and
while
that
is
an
oversimplification
of
a
rather
significant
decision,
i
think
in
substance
that
is
what
--
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
this
court
could
not
have
granted
certiorari
to
judge
fuld's
decision
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
said,
“first
we
find
the
confession
coerced,
that
is
the
federal
question
we
decide.
but
you
could
not
reverse
the
case
and
send
it
back
to
new
york
with
directions
to
sustain
a
writ
of
coram
nobis
because
new
york
does
not
have
the
power.
it
has
no
such
procedure
for
this
kind
of
case.”
this
court
will
not
take
a
case,
i
believe,
for
the
purpose
of
creating
a
procedure
in
a
state
court.
now,
although
its
opinions
may
at
some
time
influence
a
state
court
to
create
a
procedure,
this
court
apparently
does
not
do
the
creating,
that
is
for
the
state.
it
is
for
the
state
of
new
york
to
say
we
have
a
remedy
or
we
don't
have
a
remedy.
and
if
they
don't
have
a
remedy
and
the
case
is
appropriate
for
federal
action
then
the
federal
court
will
exercise
the
power
which
the
state
says
it
doesn't
have.
now,
this
i
do
not
think
is
any
great
intrusion
upon
the
state
court
process.
all
new
york
has
said
is,
“we
don't
have
the
power
to
let
this
man
out.”
they
haven't
said
he
shouldn't
get
out.
we
ask
the
federal
court
to
exercise
the
powers
which
new
york
says
it
doesn't
have
and
i
think
that
there
have
been
several
recent
decisions
which
show
how
--
first,
how
the
federal
court's
reaction
in
a
habeas
corpus
case
will
to
some
extent
influence
and
beneficially
influence
the
state
court
procedures.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
on
direct
review
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
decision
on
the
coram
nobis?
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh,
if
noia
had
appealed
from
the
judgment
applied
to
this
court
for
certiorari
and
had
been
granted,
the
court
certainly
could
have
reversed.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
but
that
had
noia
appealed
he
could
have
gotten
his
case
to
this
court.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
that
he
could
have
tried.(voice
overlap)
yes,
in
a
rather
peculiar
way.
i
think
if
you
will
note
from
the
record
that
--
or
from
the
statement
of
facts
in
the
prior
proceedings
are
practically
the
facts
in
this
case,
caminito
made
two
petitions
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
for
reargument.
and
his
second
petition,
the
one
from
which
he
applied
to
this
court
for
certiorari,
was
made
10
years
after
the
court
of
appeals
had
affirmed
the
judgment.
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
denied
reargument.
and
under
the
rule
in
the
harrington
cases
that
certiorari
petition
of
caminito
was
ineffectual
and
should
have
been
denied
on
adequate
state
grounds.
and
i
think
professor
reitz
list
--
lists
this
case
as
the
kind
of
case
or
refers
to
caminito
as
a
petition
which
should
have
been,
or
possibly
was
denied
upon
the
adequate
state
grounds
theory.
and
he
refers
to
--
i
think
it
is
11
out
of
19
denials
of
certiorari
in
this
court
without
prejudice
to
a
habeas
corpus
application
as
resting
upon
adequate
state
grounds.
decisions
which
this
court
could
not
review
coming
from
the
state
court
but
where
the
court
sent
the
case
back
or
referred
the
cases
it
were
to
the
district
court,
to
dispose
of
this
law
and
justice
requires.
we
have
asked
the
court
to
reconsider
the
rule
in
brown
against
allen.
we
don't
think
the
court
has
to
do
it
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
daniels,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
court
to
reconsider
the
decision
in
daniels
against
allen,
part
of
the
brown
against
allen
group
of
cases,
where
the
court
as
argued
by
the
petitioner
held
the
failure
to
appeal
bars
federal
relief.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
it
if
you
define
the
decision
as
meaning
what
i
say
it
means.
i
think
it
--
i
must
put
it
as
boldly
as
that.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that
is
language
which
can
be
taken
as
having
been
said
by
the
court.
if
it
is
taken
literally
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
but
he
then
was
granted
in
the
state
courts
a
coram
nobis
proceeding
which
allowed
him
to
raise
the
questions
which
he
subsequently
sought
to
raise
in
the
federal
court.
that
under
the
uniform
rulings
of
this
court
has
been
held
sufficient
to
preserve
the
federal
question
for
federal
court
consideration.
and
i
must
confess
the
court
does
not
discuss
that
in
its
opinion
in
brown
or
daniels
against
allen.
i
also
must
confess
that
the
court's
opinion
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
the
lack
of
substance
to
the
federal
claims
which
the
petitioner
sought
to
raise,
but
i
think
those
were
factors
in
that
case,
which
are
not
factors
in
this
case.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
your
honor.
that
--
i
grant
you
that
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
in
the
carolina
court?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
they
--
the
daniels
and
allen
cases
had
been
in
the
state
court.
judgment
–

the
untimely

of

by

--
i
think
it's
georgia
--
carolina
court
with
leave
to

a
coram

petition
upon
a
showing
of
substantiality.
defendants
did
that
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
not
the
question
of
whether
it
was
substantial.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
state
court
found
that
the
federal
claims
were
insubstantial.
that
i
suggest
is
consideration
on
the
merits.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
realize
that,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
realize
that,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
your
honor.
he
brought
this
coram
nobis
proceeding
then
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right,
but
after
the
coram
--
it
was
after
the
coram
nobis
proceeding
that
he
brought
his
federal
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
if
there
had
been
no
right
of
coram
nobis
in
north
carolina,
then
i
think
we
have
the
same
situation
we
have
here.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
that's
--
i
must
admit
to
some
awkwardness
in
approaching
this
question
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
then
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
then
i'm
--
in
view
of
that,
i
am
bluntly
asking
for
reconsideration
of
daniels
against
allen.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh,
yes
sir
they
were.
now,
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh,
well,
in
--
as
i
recall
it
in
the
district
court
it
was
denied
solely
on
the
merits.
in
the
court
of
appeals
it
was
sustained
both
on
the
merits
and
the
procedural
ground.
i
think
the
district
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
he
refers
to
it.
i
don't
think
he
held
it
dispositive.
he
definitely
--
he
held
a
hearing
which
shows
that
he
went
to
the
merits.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
your
honor.
he
held
a
hearing.
he
found
the
merits
to
be
completely
insubstantial.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
relying
on
the
double
ground
of
lack
of
merit
and
the
procedural
ground
this
court
reached
only
the
procedural
question.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that
is
correct.
then
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
that
is
one
of
our
suggestions
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
case.
i
--
i
confess
that
that
is
just
a
suggestion
and
the
opinion
must
speak
for
itself.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
would
think
that
before
a
district
court
should
be
asked
to
decide
that,
which
i
think
is
a
very
brave
step,
before
a
district
court
is
asked
to
decide
that,
it
should
be
asked
to
consider
whether
these
circumstances
--
that
the
circumstances
are
sufficiently
strong
to
say
that
the
state
procedure
or
the
state
lack
of
procedure
violates
the
due
process
clause
or
equal
protection.
if
the
absence
of
procedure
is
such
a
strong
factor
then
i
think
that
it
just
moves
over
into
being
circumstances
so
compelling
that
the
district
court
must
sustain
the
writ
despite
any
procedural
lapse
which
may
have
occurred
up
to
that
point.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
i'm
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
think
so.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right,
in
other
words
--
what
we're
getting
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right.
what
we're
getting
at
is
that
--
is
that
the
federal
court
has
the
power
to
issue
the
writ
in
a
situation
where
factually
it
should
be
issued
where
the
state
court
either
cannot
act
because
of
absence
power,
either
through
legislative
grant
or
whatever
power
the
court
wishes
to
take
for
itself
or
make
for
itself,
or
in
a
situation
where
it
acts
grossly
incorrectly.
those
are
the
situations
when
a
federal
district
court
sitting
in
a
state
and
a
judge
who
is
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
state
in
the
best
position
to
know
what
is
going
to
offend
the
state
or
not
if
that
is
that
state's
position,
that
their
sovereignty
has
been
offended,
that
judge
should
have
the
discretion
to
say,
“is
this
an
appropriate
case
to
issue
the
writ
or
not?”
judge
cashin,
the
district
judge
in
this
case
has
said,
he
would
have
issued
the
writ
had
he
had
the
power,
had
been
a
new
york
county
judge.
judge
waterman
who
wrote
the
reversing
opinion
had
been
the
state's
prosecutor
in
vermont.
these
are
people
who,
as
judges,
are
aware
of
the
relationship
that
the
federal
court
plays
to
the
state
court
or
aware
of
the
problems
of
federalism.
why
tie
their
hands
to
a
concept
which
can
only
mean
something
if
it
denies
to
a
defendant
a
federal
constitutional
--
in
a
case
where
a
defendant
has
been
denied
of
federal
constitutional
right
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh,
no.
i
would
not
call
that
an
adequate
state
ground
basis
for
keeping
him
in.
the
federal
district
court
would
have
the
power
to
vacate
the
invalid
conviction.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
then
under
the
doctrine
of
mcnally
against
hill,
he
would
have
to
turn
the
petition
down
as
premature
in
the
sense
that
since
the
petition
could
not
affect
the
man's
release
it
must
be
rejected.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
but
the
second
convic
--
the
second
conviction
in
your
hypothetical
case
is
a
lot
more
than
just
a
rule
of
state
law.
it
is
a
completely
independent
basis
for
holding
him.
not
an
independent
ground
within
the
same
case
for
holding
him
but
an
independent
basis
for
holding
him.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right,
sir.
and
our
brief
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
our
brief
is
devoted
on
what's
exclusively
to
saying
that
adequate
state
ground
just
doesn't
apply
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
thank
you,
your
honor,
but
the
adequacy
of
the
state
right
to
appeal
must
be
determined
in
the
light
of
the
conditions
which
the
state
attaches
to
the
right
of
appeal,
such
as,
you
must
risk
your
life
to
exercise
this
right
of
appeal.
now,
is
that
an
independent
and
adequate
statement?
or,
is
that
an
adequate
state
procedural
rule?
is
it
reasonable
to
say
of
the
--
for
the
new
york
to
say
to
this
man,
“you
must
risk
your
life;
if
you
don't,
that's
the
end
of
you?”
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
direct
review
of
the
what?
of
the
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
from
the
judgment
or
the
coram
nobis?
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
it
--
under
the
law
as
i
read
it
now,
i
would
suspect
that
my
opinion
and
my
advice
to
my
client
would
be
that
he
need
not
file
a
certiorari
petition
and
that
he
could
proceed
directly
in
the
federal
district
court
on
habeas
corpus.
not
having
the
confidence
which
my
opinion
would
lead
me
to,
i
would
file
a
protective
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
but
i
would
assume
it
would
be
denied.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
i
would.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
i
think
--
i
think
darr
against
burford
is
part
of
the
same
--
the
same
parcel.
all
--
again
this
may
be
at
least
a
simplification
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that
was
caminito's
case.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
then
i
think
we
are
in
the
same
position
that
we
are
in
because
of
his
failure
to
take
his
appeal
to
the
intermediate
appellate
court,
to
the
superior
appellate
court
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
all
of
my
understanding
of
darr
against
burford
is
that
in
holding
that
whether
this
court
on
certiorari
petition
is
either
acting
as
a
state,
as
a
superior,
superior
state
court
or
as
a
federal
court
that
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
and
also
darr
against
burford
also
--
yes,
it
is
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
sir
it
is,
but
there
are
exceptions.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
ordinarily.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
if
we
assume
that
the
certiorari
requirement
is
part
of
the
state
court
remedies
which
i
don't
know
in
view
of
recent
comments
as
to
the
effect
of
darr
against
burford
or
the
present
views
of
the
court
on
darr
against
burford,
if
you
were
to
assume
that
that
case
says
that
the
certiorari
is
part
of
the
state
proceeding,
it
makes
no
difference,
any
point
where
there
has
been
a
default,
places
the
case
in
exactly
the
same
situation
and
then
you
are
left
with
the
situation
as
we
suggest
where
the
district
court
then
says,
should
i
exercise
my
discretion
or
not?
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
that's
what
--
i
think
also
would
special
circumstances
mean.
i
mean
there
are
so
many
ways
of
characterizing
the
issues
in
the
case
and
i
don't
envy
--
envy,
your
honors,
the
problem
of
having
to
find
out
which
of
these
principles
apply
because
quite
frankly,
i
don't
know
either.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
is
why
i
have
offered
these
alternative
bases
for
decision
because
as
i
say
from
the
discussion
until
this
court
speaks
in
this
case
or
if
it
chooses
to,
there
is
no
law
of
habeas
corpus.
and
we
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
case
where
the
court
can
lay
down
a
clear,
simple,
precise
rule
for
the
district
courts
to
follow.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
use
your
judgment.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
issue
to
it
--
the
statute
says,
“you
shall
hear
and
determine
the
questions
and
dispose
of
the
matter
as
law
and
justice
require.”
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
i
don't
want
to
get
involved
with
writ
of
right
and
writ
of
course.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct
and
the
injunction
upon
the
district
judge
in
these
cases
that
he
must
issue
it
within
three
days.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
no,
you
don't
try
it
over
again.
you
give
up
a
lot
of
things.
noia
gave
up
a
lot
of
things
when
he
did
not
appeal
from
this
judgment.
mr.
siegel
referred
to
some
errors
of
state
law
in
this
record.
well,
there's
one
error
of
state
law
which
is
patent
from
this
record.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
because
we
say
there
is
nothing
that
new
york
could
have
done
other
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
right,
and
those
errors
would
have
given
up.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
we
have
presented
the
case
to
the
new
york
--
assuming
an
appeal
had
been
taken,
point
one
is
confession
was
coerced
as
a
matter
of
law.
this
is
a
case
where
there
is
a
jury
--
direction
to
acquit
if
the
confession
was
found
to
be
coerced.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
now,
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
alternative
but
to
reach
this
one
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
error
--
the
error
dealt
with
the
admissibility
of
when
the
doctor
was
testifying
as
to
the
beatings
which
noia
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
hope
that
it
was
then
error
--
it
was
an
error
to
which
the
defendant
was
denied
the
benefit
of
the
correct
rule.
it
was
a
situation
where
the
doctor
was
asked
did
noia
complained
to
you
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh,
i
think
--
i
think
he
was
in
--
your
honor,
in
every
state
court
trial
there
are
errors
of
state
law.
i
mean
you
--
whether
they're
reversible
errors
or
not
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
that
is
correct.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
because
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
because
here
we
have
--
but
the
ultimate
result
always
must
be
the
same
result.
the
ultimate
result
always
is
that
somebody,
somewhere
along
the
line
whether
it's
the
jury
upon
a
retrial,
whether
it's
the
appellate
court
upon
the
initial
appeal
or
whether
it's
the
appellate
court
upon
a
second
appeal
from
the
retrial,
somewhere
along
the
line
on
the
basis
of
this
record
and
on
the
basis
of
everything
that
the
people
have
offered,
somewhere
along
the
line
the
new
york
court
had
to
reverse
this
conviction.
now,
true
it
might
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
18
years.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
well,
no.
what
i'm
referring
to
is
say
that
was
just
a
general
error
of
state
law.
and
say
we
had
a
disputed
question
of
fact
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
sir.
because
sometimes
that
state's
appellate
procedure
can
influence
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
there
is
coercion.
there
are
ways
in
which
a
state
court
may
reinforce
a
finding
of
fact
made
by
a
trial
court.
and
that
becomes
part
of
the
state
court
findings
which
a
federal
court
must
consider.
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
there
was
nothing
that
the
state
could
do.
the
state
says
noia
had
to
appeal
so
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
could
have
let
him
go
or
so
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
could
have
made
the
same
mistake
they
made
with
the
other
two
fellows.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
sir.
the
one
minor
distinction
that
we
have
made
as
far
as
daniels
is
concerned
is
that
we
say
that
in
that
case,
it
is
very
possible
that
the
defendant
did
not
make
out
the
showing
of
the
flagrant
violation,
and
we
suggest
that
as
a
possible
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh,
yes
sir.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
i
think
that
two
arguments
of
the
volition
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes,
he
would.
i
mean,
i
think
the
two
arguments
dealing
with
being
volitional
on
the
one
hand
as
being
a
sort
of
excuse
or
not,
not
volitional
being
a
sort
of
excuse
and
the
--
a
clear
violation
of
right
appearing
on
the
record
which
nothing
could
have
been
done
about
are
independently
(voice
overlap).
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
yes
sir.
that
is
one
of
the
theories
that
we
have
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
unless
he
does
the
state
out
of
some
defense,
the
federal
habeas
corpus
action
by
his
failure
to
appeal
which
i
believe
is
the
holding
in
spencer.
whereby
not
appealing,
he
prevents
the
state
from
making
some
sort
of
state
court
decision,
an
interpretation
of
a
state
court
statute,
a
finding
of
fact;
something
which
would
bind
the
federal
court
or
would
be
entitled
to
great
weight
in
the
federal
court
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
then
the
state
has
lost
nothing
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i
hardly
think
the
state
of
new
york
can
complain
about
that.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
only
thing
i
grant
you,
the
state
of
new
york
has
lost
the
opportunity
to
do
justice.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
oh,
no,
more
than
that,
sir.
more
than
that,
because
doing
justice
in
spencer
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
he
gets
out.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
the
state
could
have
construed
the
statute
as
not
being
ex
post
facto,
a
construction
which
under
certain
circumstances
would
be
binding
on
the
federal
court,
in
which
case
spencer
if
he
brought
his
habeas
corpus
proceeding
having
exhausted
the
state
court
remedies
couldn't
get
out.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
isn't
this
worse?
is
it,
is
it
--
let's
put
it
in
these
terms.
is
new
york
more
offended
because
judge,
the
late
judge
frank,
after
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
had
affirmed
the
conviction
unanimously,
after
the
appellate
division
had
affirmed
the
conviction
unanimously,
is
new
york
more
offended
because
judge
frank
took
the
state
courts
of
new
york
so
to
task
or
is
it
more
offended
by
this
situation
where
new
york
says,
we
would
let
him
out
if
we
could
but
we
can't,
but
he
is
restricted
by
the
power
that
is
given
to
him
as
a
new
york
judge.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
correct,
sir.
if
you
haven't
got
the
power
--
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
i've
argued
it
to
the
extent
as
if
it
were
--
as
if
the
special
circumstances
doctrine
applied
to
it
as
found
by
the
court
below.
mr.
leon
b.
polsky
thank
you,
your
honor.
