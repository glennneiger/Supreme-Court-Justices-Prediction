he
was
in
alcatraz
for
a
while,
isn't
it?
justice

stewart
and
then
he
--
does
the
record
show
that
he
ever
did
go
to
a
--
to
a
place
for
treatment
of
his
narcotics
addiction?
justice
potter

it
doesn't
show
why
the
recommendation
of
the
sentencing
judge
wasn't
carried
out,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
except
the
--
not
the
record
but
the
--
but
the
judge's
own
recollection
of
the
trial
and
of
the
--
and
of
the
petitioner's
demeanor
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
justice

we
have
held,
i
think
though
mr.
vinson,
have
we
not,
that
in
addition
to
the
files
and
the
records,
the
district
judge
may
draw
upon
his
own
recollection
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
what
happened.
and
in
this
case,
the
second
--
the
second
petition
under
2255,
the
one
which
is
now
before
us,
alleged
basically
that
he
was
mentally
incompetent
and
incapable
of
participating
intelligently
at
the
time
of
his
plea
and
sentence.
and
as
the
previous
application
as
the
court's
memorandum
in
the
previous
application
had
shown,
the
court
was
there
during
the
sentencing
procedure
and
he
sent
out
the
transcript
in
which
the
man,
so
far
as
one
can
see
from
the
record,
and
apparently
so
far
as
the
trial
judge's
impression
went,
was
intelligently
knowingly
proceeding
in
the
whole
sentencing
procedure.
and
i
noticed
from
page
23
of
the
record
in
a
little
footnote,
that
the
court
on
this
second
application
said
that
he'd
gone
over
all
those
things
again
and
then
on
the
merits
of
this
second
application,
on
the
merits,
he
was
satisfied
from
what
had
actually
happened
at
the
sentencing
proceedings
that
this
man
was
in
fact
--
in
fact
not
incompetent.
and
the
transcript
of
those
proceedings
indicates
that
he
was
not
incompetent.
is
that
--
isn't
that
true?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
long
question.
it's
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
however,
it
arose
whether
it'd
be
from
congenital
defectiveness
or
from
intoxication
or
from
the
administration
of
drugs
or,
however,
it
allegedly
arose,
whether
or
not
it
existed,
it
would
have
been
something
which
the
judge
could
determine
from
the
--
from
his
observation
of
the
demeanor
of
the
man.
wouldn't
that
be
true?
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
get
though
what
the
sequel
to
the
catalano
case
was.
