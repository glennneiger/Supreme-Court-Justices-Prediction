mr.

chief
justice

warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
vinson.
mr.
vinson,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vinson,
does
--
does
your
argument
carry
us
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
defendant
may
split
up
his
constitutional
claims
and
make
them
the
basis
for
his
many
successive
proceedings
as
he
chooses
to
start
provided
he
--
that
he
only
named
one
at
a
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
of
course,
i'm
speaking
about
claims
that
were
known
to
him
at
the
time
his
first
--
his
first
claim
was
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
to
make
no
distinction
between
that
and
this
case
where
--
whereas
--
as
a
prisoner,
he
merely
made
a
shotgun
approach
to
it
on
his
first
--
on
his
first
try
and
then
learned
little
something
by
experience
and
pinpointed
the
facts.
you
make
no
distinction
between
those
two.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
well,
i
understand
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
finish
your
--
finish
your
statement
on
that
subject,
mr.
vinson
please.
chief
justice

warren
ms.
rosenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vinson,
before
we
call
the
next
case,
i
would
like
to
take
this
opportunity
to
thank
you
for
having
accepted
the
assignment
to
this
court
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant.
the
court
is
always
confident
by
the
fact
that
there
are
lawyers
who
are
willing
to
give
their
time
and
energy
to
represent
those
who
do
not
have
the
means
to
represent
themselves
and
we're
very
much
indebted
to
you
for
your
service
in
this
case.
and
ms.
rosenberg,
we're
indebted
to
you
as
always
for
your
fair
and
earnest
representation
of
the
government
in
these
matters.
chief
justice
earl
warren
thank
you.
