mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
here
presented
for
decision
today
involves
the
extent
of
the
right
of
a
prisoner
to
be
heard
on
a
second
or
successive
motion
under
section
2255
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
simple
and
undisputed
and
quite
important
to
determination
herein.
on
january
19,
1959,
the
petitioner
appeared
before
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
where
he
was
charged
with
having
taken
three
days
prior
thereto,
approximately
$220
from
a
federally
insured
bank.
after
explanation
by
the
court
at
this
hearing,
the
petitioner
waived
his
right
to
counsel,
waived
his
right
to
indictment,
consented
to
proceed
by
way
of
information.
the
information
was
then
filed
and
read
and
the
petitioner
entered
a
guilty
plea.
several
weeks
later,
in
february
of
1959,
the
petitioner
again
appeared
before
the
sentencing
court.
he
was
asked
before
a
sentence
was
pronounced
if
he
had
anything
to
say.
an
exchange
then
ensued
between
the
petitioner
and
the
judge.
the
petitioner
reported
to
the
judge
that
he
had
been
a
narcotics
addict
on
and
off
for
quite
awhile,
and
he
requested
that
he'd
be
sent
to
springfield
or
to
lexington
for
treatment.
the
judge
accepted
his
statement
and
recommended
that
the
petitioner
be
sent
to
a
medical
facility
for
treatment.
thereupon,
the
petitioner
was
sentenced
to
a
15-year
term
and
he
is
now
incarcerated
in
a
federal
penitentiary
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
mr.
justice.
he
was
transferred
in
january,
i
believe.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
his
--
the
first
place
he
was
incarcerated
was
mcneil
island
in
washington.
i
am
not
certain
whether
they
have
medical
facilities
there
or
not.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no,
it
does
not.
the
record
does
not.
petitioner,
appearing
in
proper
person,
filed
a
2255
motion
in
january
of
1960,
asking
that
the
court
vacate
his
sentence.
as
grounds
therefore,
he
alleged
only
very
broad
conclusions
and
they
were
largely
conclusions
of
law
or
they
were
mixed
conclusions
of
law
and
fact.
the
district
court
in
california,
quite
properly
i
might
add
a
very
little
attention
to
this
petition,
the
court
said
that
defendant's
motion,
although
replete
with
conclusions,
sets
forth
no
facts
upon
which
these
conclusions
can
be
founded,
and
for
this
reason
alone,
the
court
may
deny
the
motion.
the
court
then
went
on
to
state
that
they
had
inspected
the
files
and
records,
and
these
conclusively
showed
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
to
no
relief
and
so
the
motion
was
denied.
some
seven
months
later,
the
petitioner
again
appearing
in
proper
person
filed
the
2255
motion
which
is
before
this
honorable
court
today.
in
this
intervening
seven-month
period,
the
petitioner
took
to
heart
what
the
court
said
in
its
first
decision
about
his
failure
to
allege
any
basic
facts
and
he
very
carefully
drafted
another
pro
se
petition
supported
by
a
memorandum
and
buttressed
by
an
affidavit
in
which
he
clearly
alleges
that
he
was
deprived
of
substantial
constitutional
rights
and
that
during
the
proceedings
when
he
waived
his
right
to
counsel
and
so
forth,
and
when
he
was
sentenced,
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
narcotic
drugs.
his
affidavit
very
specifically
details
this
ground.
he
states
that
he
was
confined
in
the
sacramento
county
jail
from
january
16
until
february
18,
1959,
that
during
this
period,
he
received
narcotic
drugs,
administered
by
medical
authorities,
attendant
at
the
jail,
and
this
was
due
to
the
fact
that
he
was
a
known
addict,
that
he
was
under
the
influence
of
a
drug
during
the
time
of
what
he
refers
to
as
his
trial,
obviously
the
proceeding
i
referred
to
before.
in
concluding
his
memorandum,
in
support
of
his
motion,
he
requested
that
a
hearing
be
held
to
enable
him
to
present
evidence.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
believe
so,
mr.
justice.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
separate
and
distinct
motion,
seven
months
apart.
the
district
court
refused
to
entertain
his
second
motion.
the
court
stated
that
no
reason
was
given
or
was
apparent
to
the
court
while
the
petitioner
could
not
and
should
not
have
raised
the
issue
of
mental
incompetency
at
the
time
of
his
first
motion,
the
first
motion
that
alleged
only
conclusions.
so
the
court
refused
to
entertain
the
petition,
but
in
a
footnote
to
that
decision,
the
court
again
made
the
boiler
plate
assertion
that
it
had
reviewed
the
entire
files
and
records
and
it
found
there
was
no
merit
in
petitioner's
claim.
of
course,
this
is
a
real
bootstrap
operation
because
the
claims
made
by
petitioner
were
completely
involving
matters
outside
the
record
and
on
which
the
record
could
cast
no
light.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
record
includes
a
complete
recital
of
the
judge's
recitation
of
prisoner's
rights
and
the
petitioner's
response
thereto.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
he
would
have.
however,
the
probation
officer's
report
went
before
the
judge
at
the
time
of
sentencing.now
this
--
in
this
jurisdiction,
at
least,
that
is
a
confidential
report.
the
government
in
its
brief
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
just
prior
to
the
luncheon
recess,
i
had
almost
completed
the
statement
of
facts
of
the
case
at
which
time
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
believe,
inquired
as
to
whether
the
judge
who
entertained
the
--
the
judge
who
sentenced
the
prisoner
and
the
judge
who
entertained
the
successive
motions
was
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
--
that
the
petitioner
had
received
narcotics.
on
the
record
before
this
court,
there
is
no
indication
for
such
awareness
but
in
a
footnote
11
of
the
government's
brief,
the
government
goes
outside
the
record
and
points
out
that
the
probation
report,
which
was
before
the
judge
at
the
time
of
sentence,
confirms
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
was
a
known
addict
and
did,
in
fact,
receive
medical
treatment
at
the
time
of
his
incarceration
in
the
sacramento
jail.
after
the
denial
--
rather
the
refusal
to
entertain
the
second
2255
motion,
the
petitioner
duly
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
which,
in
essence,
denied
the
appeal
on
the
same
ground
stated
in
the
district
court's
opinion
and
this
procedure
before
this
honorable
court
then
followed.
the
relief
sought
here
by
the
petitioner
involves
a
reversal
and
a
remand
to
the
sentencing
court
with
a
hearing
to
be
ordered
before
that
court.
this
is
a
procedural
matter
only
but
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
it
concerns
the
procedural
right
to
be
heard
on
a
very
substantial
constitutional
question.
we
should
first
turn
to
the
statute
involved.
and
without
laboring
the
statute,
i
do
wish
to
call
two
sentences
to
the
court's
attention.
first,
the
statute
states
that
unless
the
motion
and
the
files
and
records
of
the
case
“conclusively
show”
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
no
relief,
the
court
shall
grant
a
prompt
hearing.
the
statute
also
states,
and
this
is
crucial
language
in
this
matter,
that
the
sentencing
court
shall
not
be
required
to
entertain
a
second
or
successive
motion
for
similar
relief
on
behalf
of
the
same
prisoner.
it
is
petitioner's
view
that
this
statutory
language
with
reference
to
successive
motions,
does
not
give
the
sentencing
court
the
power
to
refuse
to
entertain
a
successive
2255
motion
when
new
uncontroverted
grounds
for
relief
are
raised.
this
court
has
never
passed
directly
upon
this
question
of
successive
motions
and
the
sentencing
court's
exercise
of
jurisdiction
to
entertain
them.
we
should
first
turn
to
the
landmark
case
of
united
states
v.
hayman,
decided
by
this
court
in
1952.
in
that
case,
the
court
goes
very
exhaustively
into
the
genesis
of
section
2255.
the
court
quotes
with
approval,
a
report
of
the
judicial
conference,
which
was
submitted
to
the
appropriate
congressional
committees
where
the
judicial
conference
stated
in
reference
to
2255,
that
as
a
remedy,
this
section
was
intended
to
be
as
broad
as
habeas
corpus.
further
in
hayman,
this
court
held
that
nowhere
in
the
history
of
section
2255
was
there
any
evidence
that
there
was
any
purpose
to
impinge
or
limit
petitioner's
right
of
collateral
attack.
and
i
quote
from
hayman,
“on
the
contrary,
the
sole
purpose
was
to
minimize
the
difficulties
encountered
in
habeas
corpus
hearings
by
affording
the
same
rights
in
another
and
more
convenient
forum”,
that
forum
being
the
sentencing
court.
with
this
guidepost
and
in
the
absence
of
this
court's
treatment
of
the
precise
subject,
we
must
look
to
some
of
the
landmark
cases
involving
the
great
writ,
habeas
corpus,
that
this
court
has
decided.
first,
there
is
the
case
of
salinger
v.
loisel,
where
this
court
held
that
previous
applications
were
proper
for
the
courts
to
consider
in
exercising
their
judicial
discretion
involving
successive
habeas
corpus
applications.
but
immediately
following
that
enunciation
in
salinger,
the
court
quotes
from
ex
parte
cuddy,
with
approval,
and
in
ex
parte
cuddy,
mr.
justice
field
said,
and
i
quote,
“the
action
of
the
court
or
justice
on
the
second
application
will
naturally
be
affected
to
some
degree
by
the
character
of
the
court
or
officer
to
whom
the
first
application
was
made,
and
the
fullness
of
the
consideration
given
to
it.”
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
fact
that
in
this
case,
no
consideration,
no
area
in
court
has
ever
been
given
to
petitioner's
allegations
with
respect
to
his
deprivation
of
constitutional
right.
next
--
the
next
landmark
of
habeas
corpus
case
is
the
case
of
waley
v.
johnston,
decided
by
this
court
in
1942,
when
the
court
said
that
on
petitioner's
earlier
application
for
a
writ
of
coram
nobis,
the
same
issue
was
not
raised
as
that
which
was
here
presented.
the
earlier
application
was
denied
for
insufficiency
upon
its
face
and
without
a
hearing.
there
is
thus
no
basis
for
the
holding
of
the
district
court,
and
the
supreme
court,
thereupon,
vacated
the
appellate
court's
judgment
and
remanded
for
a
hearing.
this
case
--
these
facts
are
also
present
in
this
case
for
new
allegations
were
made
in
the
second
motion
by
petitioner
upon
which
no
hearing
has
been
afforded.
the
case
of
price
v.
johnston
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1948
at
a
time
when
what
ultimately
became
2255
was
pending
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
i
feel
that
language
in
the
price
v.
johnston
case,
when
viewed
in
the
framework
of
hayman,
may
be
determinative
in
this
case.
in
price
v.
johnston,
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
fourth
successive
application
of
a
prison.
and
the
court
stated
that
there's
been
no
proper
occasion
prior
to
this
fourth
application
for
the
matters
raised
to
be
decided.
i
quote,
“but
here,
the
three
prior
applications
did
not
raise
the
issue
now
under
consideration,
and
the
three
prior
refusals
to
discharge
petitioner
can
have
no
bearing
or
weight
on
the
disposition
to
be
made
of
the
new
matter
raised
in
the
fourth
petition.”
if
hayman
means
what
it
says
that
relief
under
2255
is
as
broad
as
that
afforded
by
habeas
corpus,
this
language
in
price
v.
johnston
is
determinative
of
the
case.
i
have
not
gone
into
any
exhaustive
analysis
of
the
various
decisions
involving
this
point.
in
the
circuit
courts
of
our
land,
i
have
not
done
this
frankly
because
i
believe
they
cast
more
confusion
than
light
on
the
subject.
i
would
like
to,
however,
to
call
your
attention
to
one
case
decided
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
sitting
en
banc.
this
is
a
case
of
smith
versus
united
states,
cited
in
my
brief,
where
the
court
meet
head
on
the
problem
of
interpreting
the
statutory
language
involving
the
court's
jurisdiction,
the
court's
discretion
rather
in
entertaining
successive
motions
for
the
same
relief.
in
dealing
with
the
2255
motion,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
circuit,
sitting
en
banc,
held
that
such
a
motion,
and
i
quote,
“is
required
to
be
entertained
by
the
sentencing
court
when
it
presents
ground
not
theretofore
presented
and
determined,”
such
as
the
case
here.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
mr.
justice,
i
believe
that
these
prisoners
have
very
little
access
or
limited
access
to
lawyers
and
they
probably
both
have
the
same
lawyer.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes.
i
believe
and
its
petitioner's
principal
position
that
a
judge
is
required
to
look
at
such
a
petition
to
entertain
it
if
there
are
clear
factual
allegations
supporting
a
claim
that
there's
a
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
and
if,
again
referring
to
statutory
language,
the
files
and
records
of
the
case
do
not
conclusively
show
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
no
relief.
in
this
case,
the
files
and
records
cannot
conclusively
show
that
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
no
relief
for
his
relief
is
grounded
upon
matters
that
are
completely
outside
the
record,
matters
that
occurred
in
the
jail
house.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
indeed,
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
well,
your
question,
mr.
justice,
i
think
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
--
boils
down
into
two
parts.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
first,
of
course,
the
judge
is
entitled
to
take
into
consideration
his
physical
observation
of
the
prisoner
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
at
the
time
of
plea,
waiver
of
plea.
however,
this
begs
the
question
in
the
factual
context
of
this
case
of
whether
a
judge
is
able
to
determine
the
competency
of
a
prisoner
where
his
incompetency
is
alleged
to
arise
from
the
administration
by
the
police
of
narcotics.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
i
would
question
that
statement,
mr.
justice.
for
instance
in
the
townsend
v.
sain
case
that
is
presently
before
you,
this
point
is
raised
in
a
more
substantive
fashion
than
here.
in
that
case,
it
was
pointed
out
that
scopolamine
was
the
drug
which
was
used
on
that
prisoner
when
he
was
incarcerated.
that,
as
we
know,
is
the
so-called
truth
serum.
that
question
whether
a
judge
is
confident
to
look
upon
a
prisoner
across
the
bench
and
determine
whether
he
--
and
to
what
extent
the
truth
serum
has
affected
him.
the
second
part
of
your
question
in
regard
to
determination
on
the
merits,
i
think
that
footnote
in
the
decision
of
the
--
of
the
case
is
completely
a
bootstrap
operation
because
where
the
allegations
concerned
factors
completely
outside
the
record,
an
examination
of
the
record
cannot
operate
without
a
hearing
testament
--
and
testimony
given
cannot
operate
as
a
--
as
a
determination
on
the
merits.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
my
principal
argument
could
carry
the
court
that
far.
yes,
sir.
assuming
two
things
assuming
that
the
records
in
filing
the
case
don't
conclusively
rebut
his
allegations;
and
secondly,
i
--
i
think
the
court
might
possibly
place
a
limitation
upon
the
number
of
successive
motions
predicated
on
the
petitioner
having
had
a
full
day
in
court,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
perhaps
counsel
appointed.
in
this
case,
petitioner
has
never
had
any
day
in
court.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there
has
been
an
attempt
in
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
the
principal
argument
could
carry
us
as
far
as
the
chief
justice
suggests,
however,
it
does
not
have
to.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
approximately
three
of
the
circuits
have
attempted
to
graft
the
test
upon
these
successive
motions
that
involved
whether
there's
any
excuse
given
by
the
prisoner
for
failing
to
raise
issue
earlier
or
whether
there's
any
indication
that
he
was
unaware
previously
of
the
significance
of
the
facts
there
now
raised
for
the
first
time.
well,
i
submit
that
the
first
such
grafting
places
an
intolerable
burden
upon
pro
se
prisoners
who
are
unlearned
in
the
law.
the
second
is
a
much
too
subjective
test
to
say
there's
no
indication
of
an
awareness
that
he
was
not
--
there's
no
indication
of
a
lack
of
awareness
of
the
significance
of
the
facts
now
alleged.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
that
is
possible
in
these
facts
but
my
principal
argument
is
based
upon
the
contention
that
where
prisoner
has
been
given
no
day
in
court
and
he
raises
clear
and
uncontroverted
factual
issues
involving
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
thereon.
contrary
to
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
oh
no,
your
honor,
then
the
clerk
--
the
court
under
the
statutory
language
would
clearly
have
the
right.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
none.
and
in
the
second
motion
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
and
he
has
for
the
first
time
clearly
raised
factual
issues
--
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
footnote
is
completely
illusory.
there
was,
in
fact,
no
opportunity
for
a
determination
on
the
merits.contrary
to
this
principal
position,
the
government
contends
that
the
statutory
language
gives
the
sentencing
court
a
very
broad
discretion
with
respect
to
denial
of
successive
motions.
in
support,
the
government
cites
much
legislative
history
but
unfortunately
almost
all
of
it
concerns
section
2244
rather
than
the
section
we
are
here
faced
with.
however,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
what
became
2255
in
its
second
draft
in
the
congress
contained
a
one
year
limitation.
a
prisoner
had
only
one
year
from
the
time
of
sentencing
to
bring
a
motion
hereunder.
the
judicial
conference
committee
on
habeas
corpus
headed
by
chief
judge
parker
in
1947
submitted
a
report
to
the
conference
which
was
made
known
to
the
congress
in
which
they
disapproved
this
one
year
limitation.
thereafter,
the
statutory
language
we're
here
interpreting
involving
successive
motions
appeared
in
the
statute
as
a
substitute
for
the
one
year
limitation
with
no
explanatory
or
clarifying
material
with
respect
to
it.
but
i
think
it's
very
obvious
that
legislatively
the
congress
drops
the
one
year
limitation
because
it
did
not
want
to
limit
by
a
very
mechanical
means
of
prisoner
in
asserting
constitutional
rights.
in
portions
of
its
brief,
the
government
treats
this
case
as
a
problem
primarily
involving
judicial
administration
and
court
congestion,
both
of
which
are
matters
of
great
concern
to
the
mentioned
bar.
however,
they
are
not
primary
considerations
here.
our
primary
consideration
is
to
see
that
the
prisoner
who
raises
clear
issues
involving
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights
is
afforded
a
hearing.
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
let
us
assume
that
the
government
is
correct
and
the
statutory
language
as
to
successive
motions.
i
beg
your
pardon
on
this.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
assuming
for
the
purposes
of
this
motion
that
government's
contention
is
correct
that
the
statute
gives
the
sentencing
court
very
broad
discretion,
even
under
these
circumstances,
it
is
an
abusive
judicial
discretion
for
the
court
to
refuse
entertaining
petitioner's
motion
and
to
afford
him
a
hearing.
this
is
true
because
he
has
clear
and
uncontroverted
allegations
which
are
presumptively
correct
and
the
files
and
records
of
the
case
do
not
controvert
them.
thank
you.
mr.
fred
m.
vinson,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
my
pleasure
to
appear
before
the
court.
