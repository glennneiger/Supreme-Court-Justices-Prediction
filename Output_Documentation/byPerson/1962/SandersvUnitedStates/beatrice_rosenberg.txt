ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
may
it
please
the
court.
in
any
question
involving
collateral
remedies,
the
fundamental
issue
before
district
judge
is,
is
there
anything
in
the
petition
in
the
light
of
the
files
and
records
in
the
case
which
call
into
question
fundamental
fairness
particularly
specifically
here
a
plea
of
guilty
so
that
the
matter
should
be
explored
further.
that's
the
first
question
he
has
to
decide.
this
court
has
emphasized
that
this
is
a
broad
inflexible
remedy,
designed
for
that
linear
occasion
when
somehow
there's
been
a
breakdown
despite
all
the
safeguards
that
we
have,
there
had
somehow
been
some
breakdown
in
the
judicial
machinery.
and
so
the
question
as
to
second
petition
as
we
see
it
must
remain
flexible
much
as
the
lower
courts
sometimes
strive
for
fixed
rules
and
much
as
i'm
sure,
we
in
the
government
side,
would
like
to
have
them.
congress
found
itself
unable
to
formulate
them.
and
i
doubt
at
least
we're
not
prepared
to
offer
in
a
very
specific
way.
all
we
say
about
the
second
petition
is
that
the
fact
that
it
is
a
second
one
is
irrelevant
fact
to
be
considered
like
everything
else
in
the
record.
it's
part
of
the
files
and
records
of
the
case
that
this
is
a
second
petition.
and
the
way
to
be
given
to
it
must
necessarily
depend
on
the
particular
facts
of
a
case.
i
think
this
explains
some
of
the
confusion
that
my
opponent
has
talked
to
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
decisions
are
confusing,
they're
not
even
consistent
within
a
circuit.
but
in
the
case
of
smith
against
the
united
states
which
he
mentioned
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
it
was
then
in
a
second
petition
some
substantial
basis
for
the
allegation
of
the
prisoner,
so
reasonably
that
it
was
possible,
that
the
prisoner
at
the
time
he
had
not
--
at
the
time
he
made
his
plea
had
not
really
been
mentally
competent.
and
on
that
basis,
although
the
court
en
banc
split
for
its
reasons,
there
was
almost
agreement
that
the
petition
should
be
heard
because
there
was
something
that
really
pulled
into
question
the
fundamental
fairness
of
proceeding.
and
so
we
think
that
largely,
this
has
to
be
decided
on
a
case
to
case
basis
on
the
--
in
relation
to
files
and
records
of
particular
case.
let's
see
what
the
record
shows
here.
as
of
this
second
petition
in
which
about
a
year
and
nine
months
after
he
pleaded
guilty,
this
prisoner
said
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing
because
he
was
under
the
influence
of
narcotics
at
the
time.
well,
first
thing
the
record
shows
was
that
the
prisoner
was
arraigned
on
friday,
january
the
16th
on
a
very
same
--
given
a
preliminary
hearing
i
should
say,
on
friday
the
--
january
16th,
the
same
day
as
the
robbery,
bank
robbery.
that
afternoon
--
and
that
afternoon,
he
indicated
to
the
united
states
attorneys
that
he
was
ready
to
proceed
by
a
waiver
of
indictment.
the
only
reasonable
inference
from
that
record
is
that
he
was
caught
in
the
act.
any
case
on
monday,
january
the
19th,
he
came
before
the
district
judge.
and
if
you
read
the
record
at
pages
1
to
5,
i
think
the
judge
was
this
here
for
as
you
can
expect
the
judge
today
in
trying
to
make
sure
that
the
defendant
knew
what
he
was
doing
and
knew
what
his
rights
were.
he
started
out.
now,
this
is
a
typical
defendant
had
no
lawyer.
the
judge
made
absolutely
certain
to
understand
to
have
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer
that
if
you
don't
have
enough
money,
i'll
appoint
a
lawyer
for
you
and
then
he
said,
he
made
the
defendant
say,
“you
understand,
you
have
that
right.
you're
waiving
that
right
here
in
open
court.”
and
he
went
on
and
said
“in
addition,
mr.
sander,
that's
at
the
bottom
of
page
2.”
you
have
a
right
to
have
your
case
heard
by
the
grand
jury.
and
you
--
if
you
have
any
idea
that
you
are
innocent,
you
should
have
the
case
heard
before
the
grand
jury,
because
i
can
accept
only
a
guilty
plea
from
you
if
you
think
you
are
not
guilty
of
this
charge,
you
should
have
the
matter
heard
by
the
grand
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
should
even
be
brought
to
trial.
and
he
said
to
the
defendant,
“you
want
to
have
the
case
heard
by
the
grand
jury”,
and
then
the
defendant
said,
“no,
i
waived.”
the
judge
didn't
hear
him
and
he
said,
“what
was
that?”
and
the
defendant
repeated,
“no,
i
waived.”
and
the
judge
went
on
again
and
said,
“has
anybody
made
any
promises
to
you?”
and
the
defendant
said,
“no.”
he
said,
“does
anybody
made
any
threats?”
and
he
said,
“no.”
and
then
only
after
all
this
had
been
gone
through,
did
the
judge
accept
a
guilty
plea.
now,
i
don't
know
how
long
this
took
when
you
read
it.
but
when
a
judge
is
that
careful,
when
the
defendant
is
continually
giving
the
right
answers,
he
went
over
to
have
to
sign
the
waiver
of
information,
it's
hard
to
believe
that
a
judge
who
was
as
very
careful
as
this
judge
was
whether
he
accepted
a
guilty
plea.
we
have
at
the
slightest
reason
to
doubt,
the
defendant
knew
what
he
was
doing.
after
the
plea
was
accepted,
judge
did
not
sentence
the
defendant
immediately.
he
asked
for
probation
of
the
court.
and
let
me
say
now
that
i
think
this
is
a
fact
that
has
been
somewhat
neglected
in
relation
to
this
question
of
whether
to
hold
a
hearing
or
not,
probably
because
the
probation
reports
are
not
sent
up
as
part
of
the
records
in
the
case.
but
in
a
probation
situation
particularly
with
the
plea
of
guilty,
where
it's
taken
as
in
this
case
three
weeks
to
get
up
a
probation
report
before
the
defendant
is
brought
back
for
sentencing,
where
the
defendant
has
interviewed
other
people
who
know
and
are
interviewed.
if
there
are
issues
which
tend
to
pass
out
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea
or
on
the
ability
of
a
defendant
to
enter
a
plea,
they
are
likely
to
show
up.
and
there
have
been
occasions
where
judges
have
said,
“i
don't
think
i
will
accept
this
plea.
i
think
there
is
a
question
of
innocence
and
done
it.”
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
it's
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
where
a
judge
has
before
him
a
probation
report
which
would
raise
a
question
of
mental
competence
for
example.
a
probation
report
would
tend
to
reflect
that
not
necessarily.
i'm
not
saying
it's
conclusive.
i'm
saying
it's
another
factor
in
the
record,
because
if
a
probation
report
for
example
which
show
a
long
history
of
mental
incompetence,
it
would
be
the
duty
of
a
judge,
i
think
to
say,
no
matter
what
this
man
says
about
vacate
--
about
waiving
counsel,
i
don't
--
i
am
not
certain
that
he
has
a
mental
capacity
probation.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes,
i
--
well,
i
do
know
what's
in
the
probation
report,
your
honor.
the
--
and
i
think
the
record
indicates
at
least
something
about
what
was
in
the
probation
report
on
page
--
on
the
sentencing
procedure
which
is
on
page
7
of
the
record,
you
see
the
probation
officer
was
present
and
the
judge
asked
the
probation
officer,
if
he
had
anything
to
add
to
his
report
and
i
say
his
attorney
was
present,
they
had
nothing
to
report
and
then
the
petitioner
was
asked
if
he
has
anything
to
say
and
then
he
said,
i
have
been
using
narcotics
off
and
on
for
quite
a
while.
i
would
like
to
go
to
springfield.
now,
this
is
what
the
probation
officer
present.
the
judge
accepts
this
and
says,
“i
think
that
he
ought
to
be
given
this
consideration
and
before
i
sentence
him.”
i
think
it
is
evident
from
that
and
that
the
solicitor
general
has
stated
the
court
have
said
that
the
fact
that
petitioner
was
a
narcotic
user
off
and
on
was
reflected
in
the
report.
now,
in
the
same
from
that,
when
you
have
a
judge
who
is,
as
i
think
clearly,
interested
in
seeing
that
the
defendant
knows
his
rights,
is
aware
of
them,
is
making
any
waiver
he
wants
to
make
voluntarily,
a
judge
would
not
go
ahead
and
sentence
the
report,
it
seems
to
us,
unless
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
this
was
not
done
voluntarily.
in
other
words,
unless
he
was
convinced
that
it
was
a
voluntary
action.
and
so
on
the
face
of
this
record,
if
you
consider
both
petitioner's
responses,
the
fact
that
he
was
before
the
judge
then,
the
fact
that
the
fact
of
narcotics
addiction
was
in
the
record
and
then
let
me
also
say
that
the
decision
and
testimony
of
experts
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
one
have
taken
narcotics
normally
does
not
affect
one's
mental
facility.
this
is
recorded
in
the
decision
in
the
juelich
case,
the
testimony
of
the
experts
on
the
lipscomb
case
in
209
f2d.
at
831,
and
the
same
thing
is
testified
to
by
a
--
expert
from
public
health
service
in
the
cox
case
which
it
doesn't
show
up
in
the
opinion
but
it's
in
the
record
that
was
before
this
court
and
this
is
generally
reflected
in
the
jury,
that
it
takes
either
an
extraordinary
dose
of
narcotics
or
the
pains
of
withdrawal
symptoms
are
the
two
things
that
tend
to
affect
ability
so
that
we
have
that
record
at
the
sentence
procedure.
then
the
next
thing
that
we
have
in
the
record
is
the
petition
filed
a
year
later
in
which
it
has
been
characterized
as
the
shotgun
approach,
in
which
he
stated
that
his
plea
of
guilty
was
involuntary
because
it
was
entered
without
handful.
well,
it's
true
this
is
an
indigent
petitioner
and
one
can
call
denied
the
tooth
of
pleading.
but
our
statement
about
the
relevancy
of
the
first
petition,
our
position
with
respect
to
that
is
that
once
a
prisoner
know
that
he
has
a
remedy
for
a
plea
of
guilty
that
was
obtained
wrongly,
feeling
that
he'd
been
overreached
that
he'd
been
had
in
applying
the
phrase,
once
he
knows
that
if
there's
any
real
basis
in
that
or
such
an
attitude,
the
real
facts
are
going
to
be
alleged
inarticulately,
not
very
artistically
but
if
a
man
says
they
promised
me
something
i
didn't
get
it,
he
can
say
that
if
it's
true.
it's
when
he's
trying
to
fit
his
case
to
the
facts
of
other
cases
which
you
get
allegations
that
may
well
be
is
absolutely
contradicted
by
the
record
as
this
one
was,
this
first
petition.
so
that
our
position
roughly
is
this
about
the
second
petition
that
we
are
not
saying
that
the
mere
fact
that
one
was
filed
was
conclusive,
if
it
were
true
as
petitioner
alleges
that
the
first
one
was
dismissed
merely
because
it
was
generalized
and
that
this
was
a
mere
--
this
was
a
particularization
of
the
first.
we
wouldn't
be
arguing
if
the
first
was
entitled
to
any
waiver
at
all.
but
that
isn't
the
case
here.
in
the
first
place,
the
second
one
wasn't
filed
to
about
nine
months
later
from
a
different
prison.
in
the
second
place,
the
second
petition
is
in
the
sense,
inconsistent
with
the
first
because
the
first
says,
“i
knew
what
i
was
doing
but
i
was
coerced.”
the
second
one
says,
“i
didn't
know
what
i
was
doing
at
all.”
now,
when
you
have,
we
say,
the
combination
of
factors
that
you
have
here,
a
district
judge
is
justified
looking
at
the
whole
record
before
him
including
the
fact
that
it
was
the
second
petition
in
denying
the
second
motion
on
the
grounds
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
before
him
which
passed
enough
doubt
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
petition
to
justify
a
hearing.
and
let
me
see
if
i
can
just
summarize
all
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
right.
and
also
on
the
peti
--
on
the
position
which
expresses
a
general
congressional
attitude
that
the
court
is
not
required
to
entertain
a
second
successive
motion
for
relief.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
conclusive
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
all
the
factors
and
i
think
that
conclusive
means
--
conclusive
is
conclusive
enough
so
as
not
to
shed
a
doubt
on
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
the
question
is
not,
mr.
justice
brennan,
whether
this
man
did
or
did
not
receive
narcotics.
the
question
is,
is
there
anything
in
his
allegation
in
the
light
of
the
files
and
records
which
is
to
show
that
he
did
not
knowingly
and
competently
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
and
in
the
late
--
in
the
light
of
this
record,
as
to
the
careful
resentment
which
the
judge
went
over
every
step
of
the
way
with
him
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
he
didn't
know
he
had
a
remedy.
and
then
at
that
time,
he
did
not
even
mentioned
narcotics,
although
it
was
known
at
the
time
of
sentencing
that
he
was
a
narcotics
user.
i
think
that
it
can
be
said
in
the
face
of
all
these
that
the
files
and
records
conclusively
show
that
the
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
competently
and
knowingly.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
the
district
court
had
the
right
to
consider
that.
there
is
no
--
i
will
say
that
there
is
nothing
in
his
opinion
on
the
second
motion
to
show
that
he
did.
what
is
significant
even
on
the
basis
of
the
record
here
is
that
it
is
clear
that
having
had
a
probation
report
which
--
having
had
a
probation
report
and
having
had
the
prisoner's
statement
that
he
was
a
narcotics
user,
nevertheless
at
the
time
of
sentence,
the
judge
saw
no
reason
not
to
continue
with
the
sentencing
in
the
light
of
the
plea
of
guilty
which
he
had
accepted
three
weeks
before.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
i
think
that
on
the
basis
--
i
do
think
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record
and
the
care
of
the
judge
plus
the
fact
that
all
the
petitioner
alleges
is
that
between
the
date
he
was
arrested
and
the
date
he
was
sentenced
is
very
unspecific
as
today
that
he
was
given
narcotics
which
is
as
i
say
per
se
does
not
establish
incompetence.
there's
nothing
in
the
--
in
the
literature.
the
opinions
are
to
the
contrary,
that
in
the
light
of
that
fact,
and
in
the
light
of
what
the
record
shows
about
how
intelligently
he
did
answer
the
question,
about
the
facts
that
the
judge
did
want
him
of
his
right,
about
the
fact
that
he
had
already
talked
about
pleading
guilty
the
minute
he
was
arrested,
i
would
say
that
even
at
the
first
application,
but
i
say
this
that
the
motion
could
be
denied
but
i
say
that
the
denial
on
the
basis
of
the
files
and
records
is
even
more
supported
when
it
is
realized
that
a
year
later,
a
year
after
sentence,
and
seven
to
nine
months
before
the
second
application,
petitioner
who
was
aware
that
he
had
a
remedy
for
a
involuntary
or
unknowing
plea
of
guilty
with
--
let's
put
it
--
with
the
way
that
if
he
had
been
overreached
by
the
government,
he
had
a
remedy.
with
that
knowledge,
he
nevertheless
made
no
contention
that
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
i
think
so
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
is
no
legislative
history
specifically
on
this
clause.
such
legislative
history
as
there
is
comes
in
connection
with
2244,
the
habeas
corpus
cases
which
are
--
is
raised
a
little
different.
he
says,
the
court
shall
not
be
required
to
entertain
a
motion
unless
it
offers
new
grounds
not
determined.
now,
that's
almost
--
that's
not
much
clear
as
in
2255.
what
the
legislative
history
shows
is
that
the
judicial
conference,
when
they
were
considering
this
motion,
decided
that
they
would
wanted
to
have
the
petitioner
assert
every
grounds
that
they
have.
but
--
and
so
originally,
it
was
raised
that
the
court
should
not
be
allowed
to
consider
something
unless
it
raised
new
grounds.
there
were
various
judges
who
objected
to
that
saying
it's
never
too
late
to
do
justice.
and
so
it
ended
up
legislative
history
showing
that
the
judge
could
consider
it
but
did
not
have
to.
and
i
think
this
is
what
--
i
think
that
--
i
think
as
i
said
in
the
beginning
that
if
one
tries
to
make
rules
too
rigidly,
that
you
will
end
up
not
protecting
the
one
group
that
this
is
really
designed
to
reach,
which
is
that
rare
person
who
has
really
been
overreached.
this
is
rare.
we
have
also
at
the
state
courts
that
have
been
built
in
to
avoid
this.
but
if
it
could
well
be
that
the
one
person
who
should
have
a
hearing
may
not
make
his
allegations
the
first
time
he's
heard
about
it,
i
think
that
we
have
to
judge
this
in
the
light
of
experience
and
common
sense
and
reality.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
not
necessarily.
not
necessarily
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
--
except
that
obviously
we
think
it
is
relevant
that
he
didn't
raise
it
before.
it
might
not
be
conclusive.
that
is,
i
would
say
that
if
a
claim
of
purged
testimony
even
though
it
was
not
holding
new
but
if
the
only
phrase
i
can
use
is
has
the
ring
of
reality
as
a
right
it
alleges.
i
think
that
--
that
one
must
look
at
this
in
a
normally
pragmatic
way
and
say
our
interest
is
--
our
interest
is
to
do
justice.
it's
not
to
hold
hearings.
it's
not
to
sort
out
allegations.
our
interest
is
to
--
is
there
anything
here
that
casts
doubt,
if
there
were
troubling
doubt,
this
is
all
i
think
that
someone
can
say,
and
in
judging
whether
there
is
a
troubling
doubt,
it
is
significant
that
this
is
the
second
time
we've
heard
about
it,
because
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes
and
that
he
is
entitled
to
view
the
second
petition
with
somewhat
more
degree
of
skepticism
than
he
does
the
first.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
yes.
i
think
this
is
so.
and
in
a
few
minutes
that
i
have
left,
maybe
i
want
to
say
something
a
little
more
general
on
this
question.
it
sounds
easy
and
it
sounds
simple
to
say,
well
why
don't
we
settle
all
this
at
a
half
hour
hearing.
but
it
isn't
that
simple.
and
it
isn't
--
it
isn't
just
the
time
of
the
court
and
it
isn't
just
the
expense
of
transporting
prisoners.
i
don't
think
that's
really
the
problem.
the
thing
that
worries
me
most
about
too
easy
a
hearing
in
the
light
of
the
experiences
we
have
seen
of
doing
this
too
easily
is
that,
we
will
in
a
sense,
negate
the
remedy,
cheapened
the
remedy.
“wolf!
wolf!”
is
a
fable
of
human
that
reflects
human
experience
and
it
applies
to
a
class
as
well
as
to
a
person.
and
i
think
it's
happening,
i
suppose
i
have
read
more
of
these
petitions
than
almost
any
person
in
the
government,
and
it
gets
to
a
point
where
it
gets
very
difficult
to
assort
the
real
--
the
ones
that
really
troubled
you
from
the
ones
that
sounds
troublesome
and
then
turn
out
not
to
be.
and
if
we
have
many
experiences
that
the
courts
have
been
having
lately
with
this
allegation
of
the
use
of
narcotics,
i
think
the
danger
is
that
when
we
get
the
special,
the
odd,
a
very
extraordinary
case
and
it
is
the
extraordinary
case
in
our
federal
system
where
we
ought
to
have
a
remedy
there
is
always
the
danger
if
we
have
too
many
hearings,
the
one
person
that
ought
to
be
believe
won't.
and
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
one
happened
in
the
case
of
catalano
in
the
second
circuit,
where
the
court
said
this
in
its
decision
in
292
f.2d
has
said
this
may
be
incredible
allegation
as
to
a
man
who
claims
to
be
under
narcotics
for
two
and
a
half
weeks
at
his
trial,
no
--
not
noticed
by
the
court
and
not
noticed
by
his
lawyers.
he
made
very
specific
allegations,
the
court
said,
“let
us
be
careful,
we
must
have
a
hearing
just
to
settle
this
down.”
and
then
the
sequel
to
that
is
reported
now
in
311
f.2d
186.
and
i
think
that
we
have
much
more
of
this.
if
we
have
prisoners
having
hearings
too
often,
that
this
will
not
in
the
end
work
to
the
fundamental
justice
for
that
rare
case,
that
it
will
serve
as
a
detriment
rather
than
helping
in
the
end.
now,
this
definitely
means
of
course
that
we're
going
to
have
some
unnecessary
hearings
where
prisoners
will
not
be
let
loose.
but
i
think
that
we
cannot
simply
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
it's
at
311
f.2d
186
has
just
been
reported
and
the
district
court's
opinion
--
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
186,
and
the
district
court
opinion
is
that
204
f.2d
supplement
881.
this
is
a
problem
of
judicial
administration.
it's
a
problem
of
doing
justice
but
it
is
not
--
it
cannot
be
solved
so
simply
as
to
say,
well,
whenever
there's
any
kind
of
a
question,
let's
have
a
hearing.
we
think
you
have
to
look
at
each
case
on
the
record.
we
have
not
been
able
to
formulate
what
we
think
is
a
fixed
rule,
what
we
say
about
the
second
petition
is
that
it
is
relevant
to
consider
the
fact
that
it
is
a
second
and
that
therefore
in
the
words
of
justice
harlan,
there
is
more
discretion
at
the
time
of
the
second
in
determining
whether
to
hold
a
hearing.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
no,
i
don't.
i'm
sorry.
i
think
that
more
hearings
will
simply
encourage
more
--
more
allegations.
this
is
for
a
prisoner
a
hearing.
this
man
was
out
of
alcatraz
for
five
weeks.
this
has
advantages
whatever
happens
in
the
end.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
your
honor,
the
administrative
office
of
the
united
states
hold
at
least
560
for
1961
and
546,
i
think,
for
1962.
the
1962
figure
was
not
there
at
the
time
we
wrote
our
brief.
i
know
that
that
is
not
an
accurate
figure
because
it
depends
on
the
way
that
clerks
keep
their
records
and
sometimes
it
also
lists,
i
think
about
600
habeas
corpus
petitions
which
cover
all
sorts
of
other
things,
federal,
not
state.
we
tried
to
check
it,
improve
impossible.
to
check
that
there
are
at
least
560
but
i'm
sure
there
would
be
more.
i
have
found
it
unable
to
get
the
feeling,
the
figures
on
the
number
of
hearing
that
have
been
held.
we
got
responses
from
some
districts
and
not
from
others
and
we
just
couldn't
get
accurate
set
of
figures
on
this
field.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
well,
you
see
one
of
the
difficulties
is
that
because
one
of
things
that
happened,
one
of
the
reforms
that
2255
accomplished
was
to
spread
the
work
throughout
the
country
because
it
is
filed
in
the
district
of
trial
rather
than
the
district
of
confinement.
now,
i
should
say
that
the
most
--
most
active
petition
came
out
of
alcatraz
but
they
do
spread
throughout
the
country
and
it
is
hard
to
say
--
well
in
theory,
it's
hard
to
say.
it
really
depends
on
prisons
and
alcatraz
and
leavenworth
and
probably
mcneil
are
the
most
active.
i
think
that
most
of
the
petitions
that
we
see
that
come
to
this
court,
at
least,
come
from
those
penitentiaries.
i
think
particularly
alcatraz
and
leavenworth
is
understandable.
obviously,
it's
a
long-term
sentence
person
who
is
most
likely
to
resort
to
the
remedy.
i
also
have
no
figures
on
releases
that
are
--
oh
i
suppose
i
should
qualify
that
your
honor.
the
district
of
columbia
is
probably
the
most
active.
ms.
beatrice
rosenberg
thank
you.
