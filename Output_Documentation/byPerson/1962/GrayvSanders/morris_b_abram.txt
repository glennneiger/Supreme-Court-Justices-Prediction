mr.
morris
b.
abram
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
interrupt
the
procedure
of
the
argument
which
i
will
outline
to
the
court,
so
that
the
court
will
know
what
i
intend
to
argue
here
today
to
say
that
i
think
at
the
outset
or
the
threshold
of
this
case,
it
is
very
important
from
the
argument
we
have
just
heard
from
the
appellants
to
get
firmly
in
mind
the
position
which
the
appellee
takes
with
regard
to
the
differences
between
apportionment
and
voting.
now,
the
problem
arises
through
the
necessity
of
giving
a
minority
some
voice.
to
give
a
minority
some
voice
in
the
field
of
representation,
you
have
got
to
have
some
classifications,
districting
is
classification.
if
the
drawing
of
a
line
in
saying
this
man
is
in
this
district,
this
man
is
another.
that
at
least
is
classification.
the
only
other
way
you
can
give
a
minority
of
voice
and
representation
is
either
to
have
a
proportional
system
of
representation
or
to
ignore
the
minority's
voice
by
elections
at
large.
therefore,
using
our
system
which
is
not
a
proportional
system,
the
american
system
hasn't
developed
that
way,
if
you
are
going
to
give
a
minority
a
voice,
a
voice,
not
control,
you
must
have
some
classification.
now,
in
the
field
of
voting,
no
classification
is
necessary
because
one
man's
vote
is
his
fair
voice
and
no
classification
is
necessary
and
nor
is
any
classification
usual
at
least
in
american
history
and
in
any
of
the
state
practices
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
three
that
have
been
described
here
today.
the
truth
is
that
in
franchise
exercise,
the
majority
or
the
plurality
control
generally
under
our
law,
but
through
a
unit
system
and
the
only
purpose
of
it
could
be
is
to
see
that
a
minority
prevails
because
one
or
the
other
must.
if
you
try
the
classification
of
voters,
qualified
voters,
that
to
the
state
is
to
aside
who
is
a
qualified
voter,
in
order
to
give
one
man
a
greater
vote
there
is
an
opposite
side
of
this
coin.
you
have
had
to
give
somebody
else
a
lesser
vote,
so
obvious
the
classification
in
the
field
of
voting
must
in
necessity
involve
discrimination.
now,
i
should
like
to
point
out
that
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that's
a
perfectly
proper
classification,
i
should
think,
the
age
classification.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
but
he
might
very
well
do
so,
but
i
think
that
i
could
defend
that
sir
and
i
would
be
prepared
to
do
so
if
that
were
the
issue,
but
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
think
they're
all
(voice
overlap)
to
this
but
i
think
that
particular
suggestion
appeals
to
me
as
a
reasonable
one.
i
might
say
this
sir,
under
the
law
of
georgia
in
talbert
versus
long,
our
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
qualifications
of
voters
are
established
in
the
constitution,
article
ii
section
2
and
that
once
that
classification
has
been
established
in
the
constitution,
the
power
to
further
classify
is
exhausted
and
the
legislature
has
no
further
power.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
a
matter
of
state
constitution.
now
sirs,
prior
to
1962,
it
shall
be
my
contention
here,
the
county
unit
system
had
developed
into
the
irrational,
discriminatory
practice.
and
this
had
been
permitted
because
it
was
favorable
to
those
who
control
the
political
system
of
georgia.
but
the
new
act
of
1962,
i
shall
try
to
demonstrate
was
a
deliberately
discriminatory
device.
it
didn't
just
grow.
it
was
created
in
a
few
days
of
the
general
assembly
session.
in
answer
to
my
brother's
argument
that
this
is
something
that
the
people
through
their
representatives
want,
i
would
point
out
at
the
threshold
of
the
argument
that
the
georgia
legislature
which
passed
this
unit
system
which
is
presently
under
attack
and
was
held
void
was
a
legislature
whose
lower
house
represented
22%
of
the
people.
the
majority
of
the
house
represented
22%
of
the
people
and
the
majority
of
the
senate,
it's
now
been
reapportioned
which
passed
this
act
was
elected
sirs,
by
5.5%
of
the
people
of
georgia
due
to
the
rotation
system
which
i
can't
go
into.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well
sir,
i
--
i
don't
adopt
that
premise.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
oh,
yes
sir,
because
we
have
not
had
sir,
in
dealing
with
history
which
i
presumed
is
permissible,
we
have
not
had
a
governor
of
georgia
elected
in
the
last
four
decades
from
a
major
county.
this
governor
qualified
after
the
unit
system
was
knocked
out,
he
was
not
going
to
run
for
governor.
he
was
induced
to
run.
it
is
generally
recognized
because
the
unit
system
was
knocked
out.
the
votes
that
were
cast
in
the
urban
counties
of
georgia
were
enormous,
the
registration
just
surged
forward
and
the
people
went
to
the
polls
this
time.
mayor
hartsfield's
affidavit
shows
that
it
has
not
been
customary
for
people
in
the
urban
counties
to
register
or
vote
to
anything
like
it,
the
proportionate
numbers
they
are
to
the
population
because
the
fact
your
vote
didn't
count.
you
can't
say
the
system
has
it.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes,
yes,
yes.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that
--
that's
right.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
the
court
is
correct,
yes.
now
sir,
i
should
like
to
proceed
on
a
more
orderly
basis
and
in
order
for
the
court
may
know
the
course
i'm
going
to
take,
i
should
like
to
say
that
first
i'm
going
to
try
to
examine
the
unit
system.
second,
i'm
going
to
mention
very
briefly
the
point
alluded
to
by
mr.
justice
white,
that
is
the
constitutional
protection
of
this
primary,
but
i'm
going
to
deal
at
little
length
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
primary
effectively
controls
the
election
of
the
united
state
senator
because
i
think
the
seventeenth
amendment
question
could
be
in
this
case.
and
then
i'm
going
to
try
to
measure
the
county
unit
statute
against
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
practice
and
principle.
and
then
i'm
going
to
briefly
discuss
the
seventeenth
amendment
question.
now
to
begin
with,
i
think
mr.
justice
white
was
correct
when
he
asked
the
question
or
if
there
was
an
implication
in
the
question,
what
would
be
the
effect
of
georgia
saying
that
a
man
in
echols
county
shall
have
seven-and-a-half
ballots,
a
man
in
clayton,
one
ballot,
dekalb,
three-fifths
of
a
ballot,
a
man
in
fulton
half
a
ballot,
a
man
just
one
county
removed,
three-and-a-half
ballots,
a
man
over
a
county
line,
one-and-a-fifth
ballots.
for
no
matter
how
you
look
at
the
unit
system
this
is
precisely
its
effect
and
that's
what
it's
designed
to
achieve.
the
system
is
further
more
compounded
in
its
effect
by
the
fact
that
a
man
does
not
have
to
get
the
majority
of
the
votes
of
the
county
in
order
to
carry
the
full
county
units
straight
to
the
county.
in
a
five-man
race,
a
man
may
get
30%
of
the
votes
of
a
county
and
carry
the
full
unit
vote
of
the
county
thus
reversing
the
vote
for
those
who
voted
against
him
who
were
in
the
majority.
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
system
contrived
to
produce
some
rather
absurd
results.
for
example
in
1954,
the
governor
of
georgia
was
overwhelmingly
elected
by
unit
votes
though
he
only
received
36%
of
the
popular
votes
and
72%
of
the
people
had
in
fact
voted
for
somebody
else.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
oh,
yes
sir,
it
is
possible
under
the
amendments.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
no,
sir.
he
must,
but
if
your
honor,
if
there
--
one
man
has
the
majority
of
the
popular
vote
and
the
other
man
has
a
majority
of
the
unit
vote
then
they
get
into
a
run-off
under
a
unit
vote.
and
then
you
got
the
man
who
won
the
popular
vote
tagged,
there's
a
popular
vote
candidate
in
a
county
unit
election
which
of
course
would
be
politically
disastrous.
now,
the
system
i
said
a
moment
ago,
prior
to
1962
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it
would
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it
would
be
that
sir
and
mayor
hartsfield's
affidavit
in
the
record
shows
why
there
were
campaign
after
campaign
of
scorn
and
vilifications
directed
against
the
most
people
of
the
state
who
lived
in
urban
centers,
day
after
day
from
the
start.
the
record
shows
this,
the
kind
of
language
that
was
used
against
people
from
cities.
and
the
kind
of
a
program
hit
upon
the
cities
in
election
after
election
by
people
who
presumably
were
trying
to
represent
it.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
under
the
unit
system,
it
doesn't
help
if
the
people
have
(inaudible),
if
the
units
are
against
you.
the
record
is
complete
i
think
on
that
point
sir.
now,
when
the
governor
called
the
legislature
after
this
suit
was
filed,
he
called
it
and
i
quote
his
call,
“to
preserve,
protect
and
defend
the
traditional
democratic
institutions
existing
in
this
state,”
meaning
the
unit
system.
there
is
on
the
record
an
affidavit
from
a
legislator
who
was
present
at
the
briefing
sessions
about
this
legislation
and
i'd
like
to
read
to
you
what
he
said
went
on
there.
“the
general
tenure
of
the
briefings
of
the
governor
and
the
attorney
general
and
the
associated
counsel
present
at
said
meeting
of
april
the
10th,
1962
was
to
preserve,
protect
the
county
unit
system,
maintaining
as
far
as
possible
existing
discrimination
ratios,
and
to
do
as
little
as
possible
to
correct
these
and
at
the
same
time
attempting
to
prevent
further
intervention
by
the
federal
courts.”
now,
i
might
say
that
there
is
not
one
scintilla
of
evidence
in
this
record
to
contradict
this
purpose
and
intent
which
was
--
which
was
flagrantly
demonstrated
in
the
trial
of
the
case
below.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
sir,
we
don't
keep
records
of
legislature
debates.
we
don't
have
committee
reports
in
general
either
sir.
now
the
system
as
it
was
devised
is
a
bracket
system.
from
zero
to
15,000
population,
you
get
two
units,
then
you
get
another
unit
for
additional
4999
people,
then
a
unit
for
9999,
then
a
unit
for
14,999,
then
a
unit
for
14,999
and
then
two
units
for
29,999.
now,
it's
rather
curious,
30,000
people
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale
get
four
units,
30,000
additional
people
at
the
top
of
the
scale
get
two
units.
29,999
people
at
the
bottom
of
the
scale
get
four
units,
but
29,998
people
at
the
top
of
the
scale
get
no
units.
now,
it's
mentioned
that
the
history
of
the
unit
system
supports
this.
i
might
point
out
--
i'm
going
to
argue
that
no
unit
system
is
permissible
because
the
--
of
course
the
decision
below
was
standard,
the
court
adapted
that
principle
which
i
think
is
the
correct
principle
in
this
case.
but
in
1970,
50.5%
of
the
people
had
forty-four
and
eight-tenths
percent
of
units.
the
effect
of
the
system
as
demonstrated
in
the
hartsfield
affidavit
has
been
--
it
has
been
politically
profitable
for
candidates
for
statewide
officers
to
run
races
in
which
direct
attacks
are
made
upon
the
centers
having
the
greatest
population.
no
man
from
fulton
county
has
served
as
governor
for
four
decades.
no
fulton
man
or
united
states
senator
in
the
20th
century.
there
hasn't
been
a
fulton
county
congressman
serving
a
full
term
for
25
years
until
the
unit
system
was
voluntarily
abandoned
and
congressman
james
davis
who
had
been
twice
elected
by
a
minority
vote
and
twice
defeated
by
a
majority
was
sent
home
and
a
new
man
returned
to
washington.
there
was,
as
mayor
hartsfield
has
pointed
out,
a
tremendous
lack
of
interest
in
elections
growing
out
of
this
state
of
affairs.
i
might
point
out
further
that
there
is
not
one
sentence
in
this
record
which
shows
that
any
public
permissible
good
or
and
was
achieved
by
the
unit
system
or
prevented
by
it.
the
record
does
show
however,
and
i
think
by
plenty
of
evidence
that
there
is
a
connection
between
the
county
unit
system,
a
negro
disfranchisement.
now,
i
shan't
go
into
this
at
great
length
but
the
basic
premise
of
this
argument
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
no,
sir.
but
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
in
nixon
versus
herndon,
it
was
said
by
the
court,
mr.
justice
holmes
that
the
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
so
great
he
didn't
have
to
rule
under
the
fifteenth
amendment.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
and
that
will
be
my
argument
here
too.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
i
mentioned
it
only
to
show
that
the
purpose
of
this,
this
deliberate
discrimination
and
the
reason
for
permitting
this
--
this
secular
discrimination
over
a
long
period
to
develop
was
that
it
was
giving
a
great
deal
of
benefit
to
those
who
wish
to
depress
and
to
void
the
negro
franchise.
but
i
think
it's
only
fair
to
say
that
i
don't
want
to
say
anything
more
about
it
except
the
record
shows
that
where
the
county
unit
power
gave
to
the
inbuilt
political
apparatus,
the
greatest
advantage
there,
you
had
real
negro
disfranchisement
and
in
certain
counties
with
large
negro
populations,
with
high
unit
values,
no
votes
at
all
from
negroes.
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
urban
counties
where
the
negroes
were
voting
and
of
reasonable
proportion
of
their
population,
their
votes
didn't
count.
it
ends
up
in
a
statement
by
professor
banner
which
is
in
the
record.
these
facts
had
a
considerable
bearing
upon
the
determination
of
rural
lawmakers
to
maintain
the
county
unit
system.
now,
maintain
it,
they
have.
in
1952
and
in
1950,
a
constitutional
amendment
was
submitted
by
the
legislature
having
them
passed
by
two-thirds
of
both
houses
to
the
people
of
the
state
to
engraft
the
system
upon
the
constitution
and
each
election
by
popular
vote
of
about
30,000
majority,
the
attempt
was
defeated.
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
possible
that
there
would
have
been
any
change
in
this
had
it
not
been
for
baker
versus
carr
and
the
intervention
of
the
federal
court
below.
and
i
might
quote
mr.
madison
on
this
principle
who
says
in
the
debate
on
article
i,
section
4
of
the
constitution,
the
right
of
the
congress
to
control
the
time,
place
and
manner
of
elections,
he
said
this.
“the
inequality
of
representation
in
the
legislature
of
a
particular
state
would
produce
a
like
and
equality
in
their
representation
in
the
national
legislature
as
it
was
presumable
that
counties
have
power
in
the
former
would
secure
it
to
themselves
in
the
latter
and
secure
it
to
themselves
they
did
in
georgia.”
i
should
like
now
to
turn
to
the
question
whether
this
primary
is
protected
and
i
want
to
read
one
statement,
one
sentence
here
from
the
classic
case
which
i
think
outlines
it
in
its
proper
form.
where
the
state
law
has
made
the
primary
an
integral
part
of
the
procedure
of
choice
or
where
in
fact
the
primary
effectively
controls
the
choice,
the
right
of
the
elector
to
have
his
ballot
counted
at
the
primary
election
includes
the
rights
protected
by
article
i,
section
2.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it
does
not,
but
it
does
say
this,
that
if
a
primary
be
conducted,
it
shall
be
conducted
by
the
unit
system.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
no
sir,
but
there
is
a
reason
why
it
will
not
happen.
and
that
is
when
a
man
goes
through
a
primary,
he
has
got
a
badge
of
respectability
attached
to
him
which
makes
him
a
formidable
candidate
at
the
polls.
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons,
i
suggest,
why
the
republican
party
has
not
developed
in
georgia,
you
can
always
make
the
argument
they
have
nominated
their
man
on
a
telephone.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
no
sir,
there
are
great
many
of
them
and
many
of
them
--
i
must
say
that
many
of
them
are
people
of
great
substance
and
ability.
but
the
point
is
they
are
still
not
conducting
a
primary
and
i
suspect
one
of
the
reasons
they
haven't
is
because
they
would
have
to
do
it
by
the
unit
system
and
they
would
be
tarred
with
the
same
brush
that
they
used
in
arguing
against
the
democratic
candidates
that
they
have
a
unit
system
of
election.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
would
suppose
that
if
state
law
governed
it
in
some
way
and
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
didn't
govern
it
at
all.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
let
me
state
two
answers
that
i
have
to
that
sir.
the
first
answer
in
georgia,
the
democratic
party
did
held
a
convention
of
this
party,
it
would
be
a
state
action
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
would
be
tantamount
to
election.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that's
what
classic
says.
in
fact,
controls
the
procedure
of
choice.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that
doctrine
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that's
right,
on
one-party
states.
now,
on
the
two-party
state
i
think
the
thing
is
less
clear,
but
i
should
say
that
the
two-party
state
still
couldn't
do
certain
things
with
respect
to
convention,
they
couldn't
bar
negroes,
i
am
sure
the
fifteenth
amendment
would
control
that.
and
i
suppose
if
there
are
limits
to
what
you
can
do
in
a
convention.
i
don't
want
to
try
to
argue
about
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
(voice
overlap)
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
must
say
i
don't
know
what
the
court
would
do
with
it
if
the
case
got
here
but
my
feeling
is
that
that
is
not
before
us
because
in
georgia,
the
case
before
us
without
any
doubt
the
democratic
party
controls
the
procedure
of
choice
under
the
classic
doctrine.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes,
i
understand.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
but
i
would
say
this,
terry
versus
adams
goes
very
far,
because
in
that
case
you
held
it
was
state
action
for
this
jaybird
party
to
have
a
nomination
process,
excluding
negroes
with
respect
to
what,
with
respect
to
county
and
precinct
offices
in
a
pre-primary
--
primary
entirely
unregulated
by
state
law.
now
under
the
doctrine
of
terry
versus
adams
it
wouldn't
take
much
of
an
extension
to
get
the
kind
of
a
problem
that
the
court
is
speaking
of.
now,
whether
or
not
the
georgia
primary
is
tantamount
to
election,
i
think
you
have
the
precedent
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
in
thompson
versus
talmadge
which
said
this.
over
a
period
of
approximately
half
a
century
before
the
drafting
of
the
1945
constitution,
throughout
that
period,
there
has
been
only
one
and
one
dominant
political
party
in
the
state.
and
professor
banner
says
in
his
affidavit
that
georgia
has
been
one-party
state
since
removal
of
federal
troops
in
1871,
none
but
democrats
have
held
the
state
office
since
the
1890
decade
after
which
period
this
party
has
been
completely
in
control
of
statewide
elections.
you
have
before
you
in
the
record
the
kind
of
voting
that
takes
place
in
the
general
election
as
compared
to
the
primary
and
non-presidential
years
and
except
when
some
grave
constitutional
questions
are
being
presented
for
ratification
which
further
demonstrates
that
this
primary
is
a
procedure
of
choice.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
now
to
turn
to
this
equal
protection
problem
in
this
case
and
i
want
to
start
by
saying
that
the
due
process
clause
was
pleaded
in
the
complaint.
we
have
not
stressed
it
before
this
court
for
the
reason
that
in
beadle
versus
scholle,
the
chief
justice
stated
this.
“as
this
court
has
recognized
discrimination
maybe
so
unjustifiable
as
--
to
be
a
violation
of
due
process.”
and
consequently,
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
address
ourselves
and
myself
to
the
question
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
i
start
from
the
premise
that
voting
is
a
personal
right
and
this
court
decided
this
point
in
u.s.
versus
bathgate,
i
have
already
mentioned
the
fact
that
i
think
you've
got
to
have
some
classification
to
give
a
minority
some
voice
in
the
representation
process
and
need
no
classification
in
order
to
achieve
that
in
the
election
process,
the
franchise
itself.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
oh,
yes,
i
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
mean
after
you
point
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
but
i
should
say
to
be
accurate
and
to
be
careful
about
it,
i
should
say
this.
after
the
state
has
classified
you
as
an
eligible
voter,
no
further
classification
is
permissible.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
sir,
i
would
say
only
this.
i
suppose
that
is
possible,
but
i
would
say
this
that
after
having
two
people,
both
of
whom
have
paid
taxes
and
have
entered
the
class,
the
state
itself
is
established
whether
through
it's
constitution
or
it's
laws.
i
do
not
think
it
is
permissible
then
to
draw
distinctions
between
the
people
whom
it
is
already
classified.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
should
think
so.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
should
certainly
think
so.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
--
no.
i
really
would
say
that
that's
historically
been
permissible.
and
whether
or
not
at
the
present
time
it
would
be
so
regarded,
i
can't
say,
but
i
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
to
decide
this
case
in
order
to
determine
how
you
set
the
original
qualifications
of
the
vote.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
would
say
this.
it
would
have
more
rationality
behind
it
than
this
statute
as
we're
going
to
try
to
demonstrate
in
a
moment,
but
i
still
think
it
would
be
in
my
judgment
irrational.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
would
concede
that
is
true.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
would
concede
that's
true.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
all
i
am
saying
is
that
once
you
have
established
too
as
a
qualified
voter,
you
may
not
then
on
grounds
that
have
in
them
two
elements
that
i
am
going
to
now
discuss,
begin
further
reclassification
and
distinctions.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
should
not
think
so
your
honor,
but
there
maybe
those
who
think
so,
but
i
don't
think
that
is
necessary
for
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
would
say
that
it
would
be
original.
i
certainly
would
agree
in
two
senses
perhaps.
your
honors,
i
think
the
general
principles
that
govern
this
field
are
these:
classification,
if
it
produces
substantial
discrimination
and
is
irrational
in
the
sense
of
capriciousness.
that
is
without
rhyme
or
reason
i
think
as
mr.
justice
clark
said
in
baker
versus
carr
is
an
improper
use
of
classification
in
this
field
if
any
classification
beyond
the
classification
of
voter
per
se
is
permissible.
and
i
also
might
point
out
that
irrational
could
also
mean
a
system
of
discrimination
to
achieve
what
is
an
impermissible
state
policy,
or
one
without
some
kind
of
reasonable
objective
in
terms
of
what
we
generally
regard
as
the
end
of
state
power.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
i
am
going
to
try
to
demonstrate
in
a
moment
when
i
analyze
the
unit
system
your
honor
that
the
georgia
county
unit
system
does
not
classify
with
regard
to
voters
on
any
basis
that
could
conceivably
have
any
rational
relationship
to
a
permissible
state
end.
now,
i
do
not
think
geography
is
a
permissible
state
end
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
must
say.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i'm
going
into
that
sir.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
exactly,
i
am
going
to
try
to
demonstrate
how
the
system
even
cuts
into
the
voting
power
of
those
who
are
generally
in
the
class
that
presumably
favors
and
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
it
on
this
record.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes,
your
honor.
you
see,
i
am
in
an
area
right
now
and
perhaps
i
should
say
that.
i
don't
really
--
on
my
premise
of
this
case,
i
do
not
really
--
i
really
shouldn't
be
arguing
the
question
of
what
kind
of
classifications
based
on
geography
or
based
on
other
things
should
be
permitted.
my
point
is
that
none
of
this
is
permitted.
but
if
the
court,
if
the
court
believes
as
the
lower
court
did
that
some
kind
of
weighting
can
be
given.
i
am
trying
to
define
the
standards
at
least
from
my
viewpoint
which
would
be
more
proper
than
others
or
less
improper
than
others.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
am
speaking
of
a
primary
election
and
i
think
it
would
apply
to
the
general
election
too,
your
honor.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
sir,
i
don't
think
this
case
really
involved
a
necessary
representation
and
i
haven't
thought
out
what
the
standard
should
be
in
the
field
of
legislative
representation.
i
don't
want
to
enter
that
field,
if
i
can
avoid
it
because
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that's
right.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that's
correct,
that
is
exactly
my
position.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
thought
i
said
your
honor,
i
thought
i
said,
some
may
think
it
is
permissible
on
the
grounds
of
history,
and
certainly
there
is
a
--
there
has
been
a
traditional
sense.
but
i
do
not
have
any
definitive
views
with
respect
to
what
property
qualifications,
how
much
property
qualifications,
what
educational
levels.
my
point
is
that
we
don't
have
that
in
this
case
because
we
have
established
two
qualified
voters
are
and
the
sole
question
here
is
whether
a
man
who
happens
to
live
at
one
particular
place
shall
have
seven
votes
and
another
man
a
half.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it
could
conceivably
be.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it
could
conceivably
be.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
georgia
had
a
poll
tax
for
many
years.
it
abolished
the
poll
tax.
now,
in
the
georgia
system
--
i'm
sorry
--
i'm
--
i
didn't
--
i
weren't
referring
to
the
question
which
i
left,
any
classification
which
produces
substantial
discrimination
and
is
irrational
in
a
sense
of
capriciousness,
no
rhyme
or
reason,
i
would
say
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
irrational
may
also
mean
that
it
may
have
a
pattern,
but
seeks
to
achieve
some
kind
of
an
impermissible
state
policy
which
is
another
way
of
saying
that
the
discrimination
is
directed
in
hostility
towards
certain
groups.
now,
the
georgia
system
has
a
discriminatory
object
and
a
capricious
impact.
there
is
no
pattern
that
you
can
discern
in
this
system
except
that
the
larger
the
population,
the
less
the
vote
of
each
voter
shall
be
counted.
but,
the
system
also
can
be
viewed
as
discriminating
as
amongst
counties
in
roughly
the
same
population
groupings,
and
in
roughly
the
same
geographical
areas.
on
page
22
of
our
brief,
we
point
out
some
mountain
counties.
now,
these
counties
are
all
small
counties
in
the
mountains.
dawson,
one
vote
for
1795
population,
towns
one
for
2269,
lumpkin,
one
for
3620,
rabun,
one
for
3728,
pickens,
one
for
4451,
franklin,
one
for
6637.
then,
you
can
go
down
in
the
southwest
section
of
the
state,
the
old
plantation
belt
and
you
will
find
discrimination
ratios
as
great
amongst
those
counties
sirs
as
1
to
1200
to
1
to
6500.
then
you
can
take
the
counties,
this
one
is
just
on
a
random,
that
board
of
the
state
on
florida
and
the
discriminations
ratios
run
from
1
unit
assigned
to
938
votes
to
1
unit
assigned
for
8211
votes.
you
can
take
it
within
congressional
districts
and
you
will
find
counties
adjoining
each
other
in
a
congressional
district
which
has
some
maybe
historical
grouping.
you
will
find
crawford
county
adjoining
bibb
and
crawford
has
one
vote
for
2900
and
bibb
one
for
11,000.
echols
county
adjoins
lowndes
in
eighth
congressional
district,
echols
has
1
for
938
and
deklab
has
1
for
12,850
and
so
it
goes.
now
actually,
how
much
rationality
is
in
the
system?
in
the
lower
court,
a
counsel
was
asked
by
one
of
the
three
judges.
now,
i
am
asking
you,
what
was
the
purpose
of
making
it
all
the
way
through,
less
units
for
thousand
as
the
counties
got
large,
rather
than
making
it
the
same
unit
for
a
1000?
what
was
the
purpose
behind
that,
the
court
asked.
counsel
replied,
“well,
i
don't
know.”
the
legislature
passed
this
bill.
we
have
to
take
it
whether
or
not
it's
valid
and
understandable
by
what
it
says.
the
state
does
not
suggest
directly
any
permissible
ends
or
state
policy
which
could
justify
this
classification.
and
i
am
perhaps
straining
at
an
implication
when
i
suggest
that
their
brief
and
their
argument
here
today,
because
it
quoted
harrington
mills,
suggest
that
there
may
be
two.
they
quote
harrington
as
saying
not
until
the
french
romanticism
was
there
any
serious
questioning
of
the
principles
of
economic
basis
of
politics.
now,
if
this
system
has
some
economic
base
presumably,
it's
based
upon
the
distributional
of
property
or
income
or
something
like
that,
but
if
you
will
look
at
the
hammer
affidavit
on
page
157
and
158
and
nine
of
the
brief,
you
will
find
that
those
counties
that
have
the
least
personal
income
had
the
most
votes.
those
counties
have
at
least
distribution
of
wages
and
farm
products
have
the
most
votes
and
those
counties
that
have
the
least
property
have
the
most
votes.
and
in
each
case,
the
growth,
the
progression
of
affairs
is
running
against
the
counties
that
have
the
most
votes.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it's
not
the
historical
basis
though.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that
they
were
arguing
it
on
a
historical
basis.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
they
could
argue
it,
but
as
far
as
i
am
concerned,
i
would
feel
the
argument
is
not
correct.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it
has
not
in
this.
but
they
do
argue
the
second
point
very
affirmatively.
they
say
that
with
regard
to
education,
and
this
is
the
way
they
put
that,
quoting
mill,
“however,
frequently
overlooked
as
mills'
insistence
that
vote
should
be
weighted
according
to
competency.”
and
then
they
quote
mills
directly,
“it
is
not
useful
but
hurtful
that
the
constitution
of
a
country
should
declare
ignorance
to
be
entitled
to
as
much
power
as
knowledge.”
now
they
come
out
on
one
side
of
that
question.
now,
what's
the
record
show?
the
record
shows
that
in
the
counties
that
have
the
least
voting
power,
you've
got
the
highest
median
educational
levels.
in
the
old
six-unit
counties,
you've
got
10.66
being
the
median
educational
level
and
in
the
two-vote
counties,
you've
got
two-and-a-half
years
less.
truth
is
that
the
record
only
shows
one
basis,
hostility
against
people,
the
more
people,
the
less
the
vote
and
the
more
the
discrimination.
now,
i
think
this
is
the
kind
of
a
case
which
was
alluded
to,
though
not
directly
by
mr.
justice
harlan
and
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
baker
where
they
said,
of
baker,
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
a
state
has
through
a
device,
however,
sophisticated
and
oblique,
denied
negroes
or
jews
or
red-headed
persons
a
vote
or
given
them
only
a
third
or
sixth
of
a
vote,
that
was
gomillion
versus
lightfoot.
this
is
a
case
--
leaving
aside
the
racial
elements,
this
case
in
which
as
state
had
deliberately
given
people
on
a
basis
not
on
their
education,
not
on
any
basis
if
they
are
willing
to
stand
up
and
tell
us
a
half
a
vote
or
seven-and-a-half
votes
and
that
feels
discrimination.
i
must
admit
that
there
is
a
presumptive
validity
to
state
legislative
acts,
but
once
you
have
demonstrated
the
kind
of
discrimination
implicit
in
this
case
in
which
a
majority
--
i'm
sorry,
in
which
a
man
maybe
or
in
which
a
--
50%
of
the
people
have
only
31%
of
the
units
and
in
which
it
is
mathematically
possible
to
find
a
governor
elected
by
50.5%
of
the
votes
in
a
two-man
race
and
6.1%
of
the
votes
in
a
five-man
race.
once
you've
demonstrated
this,
i
think
there
was
some
burden
on
the
state
to
put
something
in
this
record
and
they
put
not
a
word.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
you
mean
whether
unit
systems
are
which
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
per
se?
i
think
this
about
it.
i
don't
think
you
have
to,
but
i
will
tell
you
why
i
have
argued
it.
i
believe
the
court
is
going
to
--
probably
want
to
write
an
opinion
on
the
case
rather
than
just
a
per
curiam
order.
now,
if
it
writes
an
opinion,
i
assume
that
it
would
want
to
set
guidelines
on
the
basis
of
what
the
law
actually
is,
and
the
way
the
constitution
should
be
interpreted
and
i
think
therefore
it's
important
to
argue
the
point
of
constitutionality
per
se.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
have
never
heard
of
any
other
states
having
any
approximation
to
it
except
the
state
of
maryland
and
the
state
of
mississippi.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
and
the
state
of
maryland
of
course
is
a
two-party
state.
legitimately,
the
state
of
mississippi
i
think
you
all
agree
is
a
one-party
state,
except
in
presidential
years.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
sir?
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes,
yes.
now
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
no
sir,
but
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
but
there
was
another
unit
system
which
i'm
going
to
talk
about
in
just
a
minute,
houston,
tennessee
and
stricken
by
their
supreme
court
in
1937,
i
want
to
get
into
that
in
just
a
minute.
i
want
to
refer
the
court
to
the
language
of
a
case
which
i
think
has
been
frequently
overlooked
at
least
by
me.
mr.
justice
bradley
in
missouri
versus
lewis
at
101
u.s.
spoke
these
words.
“it
is
not
impossible
that
a
distinct
territorial
establishment
and
jurisdiction
might
be
intended
as,
or
might
have
the
effect
of
a
discrimination
against
a
particular
race
or
class,
where
such
race
or
class
should
happen
to
be
the
principal
occupants,
just
happen
to
be
the
principal
occupants
of
a
disfavored
district.
should
such
a
case
ever
arise,
it
will
be
time
enough
then
to
consider
it.”
this
at
least
is
such
a
case.
i
might
point
out
that
on
the
merits,
every
justice
of
this
court
and
every
judge
below
who
has
ever
considered
the
county
unit
system
on
its
merits
and
thought
it
to
be
a
justiciable
issue
has
ruled
it
unconstitutional.
that
was
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
andrews
in
south
versus
peters.
it
was
the
opinion
of
mr.
justices
douglas
and
black
in
south
versus
peters.
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
below
in
this
case
and
it
was
also
true
with
regard
to
tennessee's
supreme
court
in
gates
versus
long
decided
in
1937.
now,
i'd
like
to
go
into
that
case
in
just
a
minute.
tennessee
erected
a
unit
system
by
statute
for
a
use
in
its
primaries
and
under
this
system,
every
county
had
the
same
proportionate
number
of
unit
votes
as
its
proportion
was
to
the
population
as
a
whole
with
this
exception.
no
county
should
have
more
units
than
one-eighth
of
1%
of
its
population.
we
have
done
an
analysis
of
how
the
county
in
the
system
in
tennessee
would
have
assigned
units
under
the
county
unit
system
in
georgia?
how
georgia
will
assign
units.
that
appears
in
our
brief.
under
the
present
unit
law
under
attack
in
georgia,
echols
county
has
two
units
and
fulton
has
40.
under
the
tennessee
law,
fulton
would
have
695
and
echols
would
have
three.
yet
applying
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
state
supreme
court
of
tennessee
declared
that
system
unconstitutional.
there
has
been
some
allusions
and
i
am
sure
that
the
court's
thoughts
will
naturally
turn
to
macdougall
versus
green
and
i
think
i
should
pay
some
attention
to
it.
the
case
did
not
say
as
i
think
my
brothers
would
agree
that
there
is
some
room
for
geographic
distribution
of
voting
strength.
it
stands
only
for
a
principle
or
permissible
geographic
distribution
of
voting
initiative
which
is
an
entirely
different
thing.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes
sir,
nominating
petitions.
now
in
that
case,
they
rose
under
the
desire
of
the
progressive
party
in
1948
government
ballot
and
the
law
in
illinois
required
that
you
get
25,000
signatures,
but
of
those
25,000
names,
at
least
200
had
to
come
from
each
of
15
counties
in
the
state.
now,
there
are
102
counties
in
illinois
at
the
time
and
the
record
demonstrates
that
you
could
get
61
--
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
well,
sir,
the
first
point
about
it
is
not
a
geographic
test
with
regard
to
voting,
but
only
with
regard
to
political
initiative.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i'm
not
going
to
argue
that
the
case
was
correctly
decided,
but
i
do
say
that
under
the
principle
of
that
case,
there
is
a
vast
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
macdougall
case,
the
first
distinction
being
political
initiative
rather
than
voting,
and
the
second
being
the
bite
of
the
system.
for
example,
under
the
illinois
system,
cook
county
had
52%
of
the
population
by
the
1940
census
and
you
could
get
61%
of
the
signatures
under
that
law
from
cook
county.
there
were
at
that
time
at
least
49
other
counties
with
more
than
25,000
population
which
meant
that
to
get
200
signatures
in
each
of
these
49
counties
leaving
aside
the
51
other
counties
that
you
could've
gone
to,
you
would've
been
getting
only
eight-tenths
of
1%
of
the
people
to
sign
your
nominating
petition.
and
this
court
apparently
thought
it
was
a
reasonable
device.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
seventeenth
amendment
claim.
the
language
of
the
seventeenth
amendment
on
this
point
is
clear.
the
senate
of
the
united
states
shall
be
composed
of
two
senators
from
each
state
elected
by
the
people
thereof
and
it
doesn't
stop
there.
it
was
very
careful
to
decide
and
to
determine
who
those
people
shall
be,
it
said
this.
the
electors
in
each
state
shall
have
the
qualifications
requisite
for
electors
of
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislatures.
it
said,
the
state
can
determine
who
these
electors
shall
be
and
georgia
has.
georgia
has
said
it
in
these
words
of
its
constitution.
every
citizen
of
this
state
who
is
a
citizen
of
united
states,
18
years
or
upwards
not
laboring
under
any
disabilities
named
in
this
article
and
possessing
the
qualifications
provided
by
it
shall
be
a
qualified
voter.
so
georgia
has
now
decided
who
the
elector
shall
be
under
the
seventeenth
amendment.
now,
having
decided
who
the
elector
shall
be,
the
state
legislature
has
determined
that
these
electors
shall
not
elect
the
united
states
senator
from
georgia.
he
is
in
fact
and
has
been
in
fact
since
reconstruction,
elected
by
not
living
human
beings
or
qualified
electors,
but
by
county
units
and
a
unit
is
not
a
person.
there
is
no
way
to
change
a
unit
into
a
person
and
if
the
legislative
history
of
the
seventeenth
amendment
demonstrates
a
desire
to
get
rid
of
the
indirect
election
of
senators,
this
system
of
course
grabs
an
indirect
election
upon
us.
i
should
like
to
conclude
by
saying
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it
says,
“the
senate
of
the
united
states
shall
be
composed
of
two
senators
from
each
state
elected
by
the
people
thereof.”
mr.
morris
b.
abram
then
it
says
with
the
people
shall
be
--
then
it
says
the
electors
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it
says
the
electors
in
each
state
shall
have
the
qualifications
requisite
for
electors
of
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
state
legislature.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
but
my
point
is
that
once
a
state
has
made
that
definition,
it
then
grabs
upon
the
people
who
are
defined
as
qualified
voters,
a
right
then
secured
by
the
seventeenth
amendment
to
vote
for
the
senator
of
united
states.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
no
sir,
because
you
would
then
have
state
elections
for
governor,
lieutenant
governor,
for
the
judges
of
all
of
our
higher
courts,
the
commission
of
agriculture,
the
man
who
sets
the
fire
insurance
rates,
the
comptroller
general,
all
of
these
offices
would
then
be
elected
by
county
units.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
they're
all
statewide
offices.
you
see
sirs,
every
statewide
officer
in
georgia
who
sits
in
the
capital
and
administers
our
law
and
runs
our
government
from
the
chief
executive
going
down
is
elected
under
the
unit
system
under
the
act
as
amended.
the
u.s.
senators
are
also
elected.
now,
the
congressmen,
the
statute
does
not
provide
that
the
congressman
shall
be
elected
by
a
county
unit
system,
but
under
practice
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes,
that's
right
sir.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
but
i
should
suggest
sir,
if
you
put
it
on
that
ground,
on
that
ground
alone,
while
you
would
have
upheld
the
judgment
below,
i
would
say
there
might
be
room
and
certainly
as
long
as
there's
light
and
there's
hope
for
passing
the
statute
that
limited
itself
to
the
governor,
lieutenant
governor
and
the
other
important
officers
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
no
sir,
for
this
reason
sir.
there
had
been
about
five
county
unit
cases
that
have
attempted
to
reach
this
court
and
every
time
we
tried
to
reach
this
court,
we
tether
between
mootness
and
prematurity.
if
we
file
the
petition
in
equity,
pertaining
to
our
election
before
the
state
democratic
executive
committee
has
met
to
determine
whether
there
shall
be
a
primary,
we
are
met
at
the
threshold
by
the
argument
but
we
don't
know
whether
we're
going
to
have
a
primary
or
not
and
you
are
premature.
but
if
we
wait
until
at
the
last
minute,
they
decide
to
hold
a
primary
which
means
the
unit
system
then
applies,
then
we
are
in
a
great
race
to
get
to
this
court,
because
otherwise
under
the
doctrine
of
u.s.
versus
anchor
coal
company,
we
then
--
be
moot
which
is
the
way
we
read
the
disposition
of
the
original
county
unit
cases
in
this
court.
so
consequently,
we
are
constantly
tethering
between
prematurity
and
mootness.
this
is
one
of
the
few
cases
that
in
which
there
was
enough
speed
below
to
afford
a
relief
and
an
opportunity
to
reach
this
tribunal.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
the
practice
there
mr.
justice
clark
is
this.
under
the
rules
of
the
party
whether
or
not
the
unit
system
is
employed
in
a
congressional
primary
depends
upon
the
decision
of
the
democratic
executive
committee
which
governs
that
primary.
that
committee
by
the
way
is
always
named
by
the
incumbent
congressman
provided
he
is
a
democrat,
incidentally
all
are
democrats,
is
named
by
the
incumbent
congressman.
so
the
congressman
does
have
under
this
system
a
way
of
determining
under
which
system
i
want
to
run.
whether
i
want
to
get
elected
by
unit
votes
or
whether
i
can
best
throw
myself
on
the
wishes
of
the
people.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
nominated,
yes
sir,
nominated.
the
word
should
be
nominated,
but
i
might
add
sirs
that
we
have
a
case
now
pending
in
the
federal
district
court
of
the
southern
district
of
georgia,
it
has
been
pending
i
might
add
for
over
two
years
there,
a
damage
suit
based
upon
a
congressman's
having
been
elected
with
less
than
a
majority
of
the
popular
vote
and
though
he
got
a
majority
of
the
unit
votes.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
yes
sir.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
it
has
to
go
on
the
principles
in
the
classic
case
that
it's
tantamount
to
an
election.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
that
is
the
election.
it
is
the
election
where
the
senator
is
elected
in
georgia.
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
as
a
legal
proposition
he
could
not
--
and
he
could
not
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
but
that's
where
he
has
been
elected.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
sir?
mr.
morris
b.
abram
no
sir.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
am
not
happy
about
them
sir,
but
i'll
want
to
be
perfectly
candid
to
the
court.
i
knew
and
i
still
that
no
unit
system
that
discriminates
a
little
bit
will
ever
be
adopted
by
the
georgia
democratic
party
because
unless
it
discriminates
a
lot,
there
is
no
magic
in
it
and
there
is
no
profit
from
it.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
exactly.
i
couldn't
agree
with
the
court
more.
i
think
the
decree
below
in
avoiding
the
system
as
it
was
then
in
use
was
thoroughly
right
and
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
but
if
the
court
goes
into
the
question
of
whether
or
not
if
this
advice
as
to
how
a
unit
system
could
be
constructed
is
or
is
not
proper,
i
would
say
that
the
system
they
have
suggested
is
improper.
mr.
morris
b.
abram
the
government
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
the
government
says
if
i
--
the
government
will
speak
through
the
attorney
general
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
the
government's
suggestion
is
that
the
court
should
not
do
any
more
than
affirm
the
invalidation
of
the
neill
primary
act
as
an
amendment
that
the
rest
of
the
opinion
is
an
advisory
opinion
and
was
improper
to
be
put
either
in
the
opinion
or
the
decree.
my
judgment
is,
my
view
is,
that
--
and
i
am
the
one
with
the
government
on
this,
the
decision
below
was
correct
in
invalidating
the
county
unit
system
as
amended.
but
it
was
incorrect
when
it
suggested
that
a
county
unit
system
could
be
devised
and
used
in
this
franchise
field.
but,
my
view
is
--
further
--
goes
further
than
i
understand
the
government's
view
--
mr.
morris
b.
abram
i
say
that
when
the
court
writes
its
opinion,
it
should
say
that
no
unit
system,
this
or
any
other
is
constitutional
under
the
fourteenth
and
seventeenth
amendment.
i
should
like
to
conclude
your
honors
by
saying
this.
it's
been
foreshadowed
by
some
conversation
already.
the
thing
i'm
going
to
say
and
that
is
that
the
worse
that
can
happen,
if
this
court
upholds
the
court
below
is
that
everybody
in
georgia
can
have
a
vote
who
has
been
declared
a
valid
qualified
voter
by
the
constitution
of
the
state.
and
furthermore,
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
way
that
you
can
uphold
this
system
even
if
you
don't
say
a
system
is
per
se
unconstitutional,
until
you
can
say
that
two
equals
four
or
feel
that
50
cents
is
the
proper
amount
of
change
for
a
dollar
or
that
you
can
give
eight
ounces
per
pound.
i
think
a
qualified
voter
is
a
qualified
voter,
is
a
qualified
voter
and
a
vote,
is
a
vote,
is
a
vote.
