mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
make
one
or
two
full
remarks
with
regard
to
one
or
two
questions
or
rather
one
of
two
matters
that
mr.
murphy
touched
on.
that
has
referenced
to
the
evolution
of
the
county
unit
method
of
nominations
insofar
as
in
1917,
it
was
enacted
into
law.
i
think
mr.
murphy
made
it
clear
that
the
--
the
basis
for
that
enactment
into
law
was
the
fact
that
at
that
time,
under
the
party
rule,
there
was
no
provision
for
a
run
over
primary
in
the
event
that
one
candidate
for
governor
or
senate
failed
to
receive
a
majority
of
the
unit
vote.
and
it
was
this
convention
juggling
and
convention
nomination
that
led
to
the
incorporation
of
the
county
unit
method
into
law.
it
was
not
as
an
unfounded
statement,
we
say
in
the
appellee's
brief
would
have
that
it
was
tied
in
with
any
scheme
to
disfranchise
negroes.
it
was
instilled
and
stirred
or
inspired
solely
as
we
see
it
from
the
desire
of
the
people
to
prevent
convention
nomination.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
--
that
is
a
consequence
of
it
both
before
and
after
it
was
put
into
laws.
i
will
come
to
that
momentarily
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
state
this
that
we
think,
do
not
contend
otherwise
that
baker
versus
carr
has
settled
all
questions
of
justiciability,
standing
to
sue
in
jurisdiction.
we
make
no
issue
of
that.
at
the
same
time,
we
do
say
this,
that
there
is
still
remains
an
area,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
which
the
state
is
accorded
a
wide
latitude
of
discretion
and
with
respect
to
which
no
court
should
undertake
to
substitute
its
judgment.
to
that
extent,
there
are
still
areas
that
are
non-justiciable
once
you
get
past
the
initial
question.
before
getting
into
the
merits
of
what
we
think
are
the
applicable
fourteenth
amendment
standards
in
this
case,
i
would
like
to
discuss
briefly
one
question
which
the
appellee
raises,
which
if
he
is
correct
of
course
would
dispose
of
this
case
and
that
is
that
there
is
--
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
have
any
weighting
at
all
in
an
electoral
system.
the
appellee
says
that
representation
is
a
shared
right
and
consequently
some
weighting,
some
inequality
is
necessary
due
to
interim
shifts
in
population
and
that
sort
of
thing.
on
other
hand,
he
says
that
voting
is
not
a
shared
right,
and
therefore,
there
can
be
no
weighting.
we
think
that
this
cannot
withstand
analysis.
the
governor
and
other
executive
department
officers
represent
the
citizen
in
the
execution
of
the
laws,
just
as
represented
--
represent
the
people
in
the
making
of
the
laws.
and,
neither
the
legislative
apportionment
case
or
in
the
case
of
the
judiciary
and
we
elect
our
judges
in
georgia
or
in
the
case
of
the
executive,
the
voter
votes
individually.
no
one
else
participates
or
shares
in
the
casting
of
that
vote
and
that's
true
in
the
legislative
case.
now,
what
happens
after
his
vote
is
cast
and
after
it
has
been
tabulated,
the
influence
of
the
effect
that
is
given
to
that
vote
is
necessarily
weighted
because
he
obviously
cannot
exist
in
a
vacuum.
there
are
other
people
to
be
considered
whose
votes
also
have
some
influence
in
a
way.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
indirectly,
i
think
so.
if
this
juncture
primarily
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
at
this
juncture,
i
am
primarily
refuting
an
argument
that
is
advanced
in
the
brief
of
the
appellee
to
the
affect
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
now,
as
to
a
legislative
representative,
the
total
legislative
power
is
shared
by
the
allocation
of
one
or
more
members
of
a
multi-unit
body
or
collegiate
body
by
the
allocating
of
one
of
more
of
those
numbers
to
particular
areas.
and
under
the
electoral
arrangement
involving
the
executive
of
the
judiciary,
you
don't
have
a
number
of
people
to
be
shared
by
allocating
one
out
to
each.
you
only
have
one
individual,
the
governor
or
the
particular
judge
or
the
other
state
house
office
and
the
sharing
necessarily
has
to
take
effect
in
a
different
manner.
so,
in
that
case,
as
in
the
case
of
the
election
of
the
president,
under
the
electoral
college
which
the
sharing
is
done
by
the
allocation
of
units
rather
than
by
the
allocation
of
individual
representatives.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
we
aren't
contesting
its
argument
that
it
can.
we
are
arguing
that
it
is
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
state
is
the
unit,
that's
correct
sir,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
well,
that
is
--
that's
true
in
georgia.
we
don't
district
the
state
for
purposes
of
electing
senators.
we
have
devised
the
unit
system
for
the
purpose
of
dispersing
electoral
power,
but
we
do
not
draw
any
district
alliance
from
the
standpoint
of
--
of
people
we
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
there
are
differences,
that
is
correct
sir,
but
we
say
this
that
if
it's
constitutionally
permissible
to
have
any
weighting
of
votes
with
regard
to
legislative
representation
beyond
the
de
minimis
weighting
that
inevitably
flows
due
to
population
shifts,
that
it
necessarily
should
follow,
that
you
can
have
the
same
thing
with
reference
to
a
statewide
office
as
a
governor
or
a
judge,
it's
--
it's
granted,
it
has
to
be
accomplished,
the
--
the
form
as
the
--
but
the
basic
underlying
proposition
is
that
if
there
can
be
weighting
as
to
one
like
what
is
there
to
say
that
you
cannot
have
weighting
as
to
the
other.
the
fourteenth
amendment
draws
no
such
distinction.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
would
follow.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
what
--
what
feature
of
it,
please?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
our
--
our
position
will
be
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
it's
constitution
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
that
it's
not
constitutionally
impermissible.
now,
i
think
you
--
it's
justiciable
to
the
extent
that
you
get
into
the
area
and
you
go
to
a
certain
point,
i
will
come
to
that
momentarily
and
if
i
haven't
answered
your
question
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
please
stop
me
but
it
would
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
a
little
ahead
of
myself
on
this
point.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
now,
in
the
court
below,
as
did
the
two
courts
in
the
south
and
the
turman
case
did
not
accept
this
attempted
distinction.
they
said
this,
it
relied
upon
macdougall
versus
green,
they
said,
“we
do
not
strike
the
county
unit
system
as
such.
we
do
strike
it
in
its
present
form
and
cited
references
to
the
permissibility
of
weighting
the
votes.”
in
the
justice
department,
i
don't
think
either
accepts
this
attempted
distinction.
they
referred
to
it
and
say
that
there
probably
are
some
differences,
but
they
end
up
saying
that
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
here
and
then
they
go
all
up
on
(inaudible)
involving
burden
of
proof
and
end
up
postulating
two
standards
that
they
say
should
apply
in
these
cases.
i
will
come
to
those
also
momentarily.
however,
the
government
does
concede
that
if
you
had
a
situation
where
there
was
not
a
direct
election
of
a
statewide
official
such
as
you
had
years
ago
with
regard
to
governors
in
many
states
that
you
probably
could
have
weighting
there.
we
say
that
that
is
exactly
what
this
is
because
the
county
unit
system,
as
devised,
with
regard
to
units,
its
simply
a
substitution
for
this
collegiate
body
that,
theretofore
had
done
the
electing
and
that
is
the
convention,
to
nominate
not
to
elect.
now,
that
brings
me
to
what
we
think
are
these
proper
standards
in
this
case
and
i
think
it
would
also
follow
in
a
legislative
apportionment
case.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
my
position,
yes
sir.
this
has
to
be
approached
i
think
from
a
two-fold
standpoint.
first,
the
validity
of
a
unit
system
per
se,
and
then
the
secondly,
the
overall
substantive
standards
that
would
apply
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
governing
the
weighting
of
votes.
first,
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
unit
system
per
se,
you
might
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
you
did
not
pass
on
it.
now,
the
appellee,
i
believe,
argues
that.
i
do
not
wish
to
occupy
the
time
of
the
court
if
you
think
that
it's
not
before
the
court,
but
the
appellee
argues
it
and
i'm
not
certain
whether
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
is
here.
i'm
not
--
frankly,
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
rules
and
procedure
of
this
court.
under
georgia
law,
if
a
judgment
is
right
for
any
reason,
it
should
be
sustained
on
appeal
regardless
of
the
reason
given
to
in
below.
and
i
presume
that
is
the
rule
here.
i
have
never
actually
read
a
case
on
it.
the
--
this
question
might
be
restated
thusly,
would
a
unit
system
be
valid
even
assuming
equality
of
population
within
each
of
the
participating
units?
the
court
below
as
well
as
the
court
in
the
turman
case
and
the
south
case
have
said
or
resolved
this
question
in
the
affirmative.
the
appellees
though
says
no.
he
(inaudible)
--
or
relies
upon
the
mosley
case,
united
states
versus
mosley
in
which
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
federal
right
to
have
one's
vote
counted.
the
appellee
says
that
since
in
a
unit
system,
the
candidate
or
rather
the
votes
of
the
unit
are
cast
as
a
unit
that
the
votes
of
the
people
within
the
unit
who
voted
for
the
minority
candidate
are
not
counted,
and
therefore,
it
brings
it
within
the
pale
of
mosley
versus
united
states.
as
far
as
the
mosley
case
is
concerned,
we
think
it's
sufficient
to
distinguish
by
the
fact
that
it
was
a
criminal
case
where
there
has
been
fraudulent
and
covert
acts
that
were
contrary
not
only
to
federal
law
but
to
state
law,
that
some
votes
have
just
not
--
it's
been
simply
--
people
tabulating
them
had
refused
to
count
them.
and
that
being
a
criminal
case,
we
think
has
no
relevancy
to
this
situation
where
this
is
legal
under
state
law
and
there
was
nothing
covert
about
what
is
done
here.
and
we
say
that
the
idea
of
casting
votes
by
unit
is
constitution
that
it
gives
recognition
to
the
organization
of
the
state
on
a
county
basis
and
that
has
been
true
as
illustrated
by
the
history
in
this
case
of
the
county
unit
system
from
the
very
earliest.
georgia
has
accorded
a
high
degree
of
autonomy
to
its
counties.
they
voted
as
a
unit
in
electing
the
governor
in
the
--
at
the
outset.
as
the
court
in
the
case
here
said
below,
counties
were
governmental
units
in
georgia
before
the
union
and
had
their
voice
in
the
councils
of
government
on
the
state
level
through
representation.
in
the
south
case,
a
judge
simply
said
this,
the
history
of
the
state
and
of
the
political
parties
within
it
shows
that
political
power
has
from
the
beginning
been
exerted
to
a
large
extent
through
counties
as
voting
units
on
similar
unit
lines.
similar
recognition
has
been
given
to
the
identity
of
interest
in
a
county
that
brings
about
the
rationality
of
treating
them
as
a
unit.
in
several,
the
recent
reapportionment
cases,
the
tawes
case
from
maryland,
the
simon
case
from
new
york,
baker
versus
carr
itself
upon
remand,
and
the
scholle
case
in
florida.
under
georgia
law,
our
counties
have
always
enjoyed
a
high
degree
of
autonomy.
they
have
it
within
their
power
to
levy
taxes
or
not
levy
taxes,
to
afford
certain
vital
services
or
not
to
afford.
they
elect
their
own
officer.
they
have
their
own
system
of
courts
and
public
records.
county
government
is
managed
by
a
wide
variety
of
boards
of
county
commissioners,
ordinances
and
county
managers.
the
georgia
constitution
expressed
the
exempts
of
county
government
from
--
to
uniform
its
provisions.
lastly,
each
county
has
its
own
school
system,
determines
amount
of
taxes
that
it
will
levy
within
the
certain
limits
and
the
extent
of
enrichment
programs
that
it
will
impose
upon
its
educational
system.
and
is
--
in
this
context,
the
unit
aspects
of
this
case
of
course
apply
equally
to
all
counties,
regardless
of
the
population.
that
brings
me
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
standards
that
we
think
are
applicable
to
cases
of
this
nature
and
similar
to
cases
involving
apportionment.
we
think
that
these
standards
are
inferable
from
a
composite
of
the
majority
concurring
and
dissenting
opinion
in
baker
versus
carr,
regardless
of
the
divergences
in
that
opinion
with
respect
to
the
procedural
questions
of
jurisdictions,
justiciability,
standards
and
so
forth.
in
the
majority
of
opinion,
it
was
stated,
“judicial
standards
under
the
equal
protection
clause
are
well
developed
and
familiar
and
it
has
been
open
to
courts
since
the
enactment
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
determine,
if
on
the
particular
facts
they
must
that
a
discrimination
reflects
no
policy,
but
simply
arbitrary
and
capricious
action.”
in
one
of
the
special
concurring
opinions,
this
statement
was
found.
universal
equality
is
not
the
test.
there's
room
for
weighting.
the
prohibition
of
the
equal
protection
clause
goes
no
further
than
the
invidious
discrimination.
and
another
concurrence
where
emphasis
was
placed
upon
the
fact
of
horizontal
as
well
as
vertical
discrimination,
the
blending
of
those
two
which
brought
about
a
situation,
where
it
was
impossible
to
determine
if
there
was
a
basis.
another
concurrence
was
careful
to
give
assurances
that
state
legislatures
need
not
be
“so
structured”
as
to
reflect
with
approximate
equality,
the
voice
of
every
voter.
nor
does
the
constitution
prevent
the
states
acting
not
irrationally
from
choosing
any
electoral,
legislative
structure
it
thinks
best
suited
to
the
interest,
temper
and
customs
of
its
people.
mr.
justice
frankfurter's
dissenting
opinion,
he
very
strongly
says
in
a
language
that
i
could
hardly
improve
that
the
idea
of
equality
of
voting
power
is
not
implicit
in
the
history
of
american
institutions.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes
sir,
i
think
that
it
is
as
far
--
as
far
as
the
constitution
is
concerned.
and
i''m
not
arguing
political
science
and
i
would
hope
the
court
will
not
argue
political
science.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
simply
because
it
has
never
been
the
law
before
that
equal
population
representation
is
the
only
legitimate
basis
of
electoral
apportionment.
also
because
there
are
other
factors
that
enter
into
it.
i
--
i
will
--
i'm
coming
to
that
and
if
i
have
--
do
not
answer
your
question,
please
call
my
attention
to
it
and
i
will
go
back,
i
will
try
to,
i
may
not,
but
i
will
certainly
will.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
correct
sir.
we
think
that
several
propositions
necessarily
follow
is
corollary
to
this
or
from
what
has
been
said
in
these
cases,
in
the
various
opinions.
first,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
limit
a
state's
choice
and
allocate
its
electoral
power
to
a
single
basis,
equal
population
representation,
either
in
the
case
of
legislative
representation
or
in
the
case
of
the
allocation
of
electoral
strength
as
the
statewide
offices.
and
particularly
is
that
so,
in
this
situation
where
this
is
simply
the
primary
and
you
do
have
a
general
election
where
people
are
capable
of
expressing
themselves
with
numerical
equality
and
that
has
been
done.
we
had
a
run-off
election
in
georgia
for
lieutenant
governor
and
a
dissent
arose
as
to
the
candidates
who
would
participate
in
that.
and
another
candidate
who
is
following
them
was
limited
mostly
to
one
of
the
big
cities
came
within
2000
or
3000
votes
of
getting
enough
signatures
to
get
on
the
nominating
petition
in
a
little
less
than
two
weeks.
we
have
traced
in
our
brief
the
history
of
legislative
assemblies
and
demonstrated
that
when
the
founding
fathers
came
to
draft
the
constitution,
they
were
divided
into
two
factions.
one,
the
french
school
of
thought
which
inspired
by
the
writings
of
rousseau
were
referred
to
as
the
egalitarian
democrats,
the
egalitarians,
one
man,
one
vote.
on
the
other
hand,
in
a
raid
against
them
was
the
british
school
of
thought
which
saw
the
necessity
for
imposing
limitations
upon
majority
will
at
its
very
source,
a
proposition
that
had
been
suggested
as
early
as
aristotle's
political,
the
history
of
the
convention
records
that
the
resulting
product
was
more
english
than
french.
in
fact,
the
--
one
of
the
affidavits
of
the
appellee
that
is
in
the
record
concedes
this
fact
that
the
english
school
of
thought
predominated
in
the
nominating
or
rather
in
the
constitutional
conventions.
it's
been
shown
too
i
think
that
while
thomas
jefferson
has
generally
recorded
as
being
on
the
side
of
equalitarian
democracy.
he
was
basically
an
agrarian
democrat
and
it
just
happened
that
equalitarianism
fit
in
quite
fine
with
his
conception
of
a
grand
--
agrarian
democracy
as
the
people
started
moving
out
of
the
tidewater
areas
out
into
the
western
portions
of
the
country
and
tilling
the
land.
but
we
don't
have
to
go
to
the
records
of
the
constitutional
convention
to
determine
what
the
nature
of
this
government
is
that
was
founded.
we
think
the
plain
words
of
the
constitution
itself
are
highly
ambiguous.
to
begin
with,
a
national
legislature
was
provided
for,
in
one
house
of
which
each
state
has
equality
of
representation
regardless
of
the
number
of
people.
and
even
in
the
other
branch
which
as
george
mason
said
was
to
be
the
grand
depository
of
the
democratic
principle.
equality
is
not
achieved
there
either
because
of
the
fact
that
--
of
the
requirement
that
each
state
had
at
least
one
representative
regardless
of
the
number
of
people.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
and
you
have
the
fifth
amendment
which
was
adopted
after
that
constitution
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
which
contains
a
due
process
clause
of
this
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
but
as
this
court
said
in
beadle
versus
scholle
--
versus
scholle
that
it
would
be
unthinkable
that
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
would
impose
a
high
standard
upon
the
states
than
the
fifth
does
against
federal
government.
the
second
illustration
i
think
of
the
constitution
in
this
regard
is
with
regard
to
the
president
who
is
elected
not
by
the
people,
but
by
electoral
votes.
and
there's
disproportions
in
between
the
states
in
the
casting
of
those
electoral
votes.
the
third
illustration
is
the
provision
for
changing
the
fundamental
law
itself.
that's
voted
on
by
the
states
in
which
each
state
has
one
vote
regardless
of
the
number
of
people.
when
congress
elects
a
president
in
those
situations
when
it's
permissible
for
congress
to
do
so,
each
state
votes
as
a
unit,
each
state
has
one
vote.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
is
the
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir,
but
could
you
--
could
you
say
that
the
federal
constitution
does
not
construct
a
republican
form
of
government?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
will
answer
that
this
way,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
say
otherwise,
you
have
to
say
that
the
federal
constitution
imposes
a
system
that
is
arbitrary,
that
is
unreasonable,
that
denies
equal
protection
to
the
voters
and
merely
because
of
the
fact
that
there's
no
equal
protection
clause
applicable
to
it,
is
the
only
thing
that
saves
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
those
differences
i
think
were
pretty
well
disposed
off
at
least
to
my
thinking
in
the
tawes
case.
if
this
argument
about
sovereignty
is
circular,
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
one
was
sovereign,
one
was
not?
it's
simply
this,
that
there
is
here
an
identifiable
unit,
a
group
of
people
who
have
particular
interest
that
those
interests
should
be
given
some
recognition.
now,
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
unreasonable
for
georgia
to
take
that
analogy
and
apply
it
in
its
own
internal
structure
as
it
has
and
as
it
would
continue
to
do
so
unless
this
court
intervenes.
i
--
i
can't
conceive
of
the
--
under
the
equal
protection
clause
which
is
itself
a
product
of
history
and
in
determining
what
is
rational,
history
and
tradition
and
the
federal
system
itself
would
seem
to
offer
some
test
at
least.
now,
the
court
may
disagree,
but
that
is
a
way
that
it
--
as
i
see
it.
that
is
the
way
i
would
answer
the
question.
the
last
point
i
think
that
we
might
say
that
disputes
the
fact
of
complete
equality
and
expression
of
majority
will
is
the
example
of
this
court
itself.
the
founding
fathers
created
this
court
composed
of
nine
men,
no
one
of
which
has
ever
been
voted
on
by
anybody,
but
yet
gave
you
the
power.
as
madison
pointed
out
in
the
federalists,
to
set
aside
the
solomon
act,
it's
enacted
by
535
of
the
people's
chosen
representatives
and
the
president
who
was
also
elected.
this
opinion
in
baker
versus
carr,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
reviewed
the
apportionments
existing
in
legislatures
and
common
law
and
the
english
procedure
and
the
colonies
and
the
states
at
the
time
of
adoption,
the
states
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
today,
and
concluded
that,
as
he
stated,
“these
figures
show
more
than
individual
variations
from
a
generally
accepted
standard
of
electoral
equality.”
they
show
that
there
is
not
as
there
has
never
been
a
standard
by
which
the
place
of
equality
as
effect
an
apportionment
can
be
measured.
we
think
that
that
brings
up
another
of
subordinate
propositions
up
to
the
general
proposition
that
equal
protect
--
equal
population
is
not
the
only
basis
of
electoral
apportionment.
and
that
is
that
courts
should
not
become
involved
in
drawing
mathematical
formulas.
that
is
not
the
type
of
thing
that
is
generally
thought
to
be
a
judicial
function.
to
begin
with,
first,
judicially
insoluble
question
that
you
have
is
what
method
of
mathematical
evaluation
are
you
going
to
use,
aside
from
the
actual
fixing
of
the
limits
and
the
formula
itself?
would
it
be
the
theoretical
minimum
of
persons
unable
to
--
capable
of
electing
a
majority
of
both
houses
or
one
house
and
what
about
a
unicameral
legislature
and
i
think
you
have
a
case
in
nebraska,
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
coming
up
here
or
not.
how
would
you
apply
to
the
georgia
situation?
would
the
--
assume
that
theoretical
minimum
is
the
test.
the
more
difficult
problem
then
remains
of
fixing
the
limits.
should
it
be
16.5%,
the
theoretical
minimum
of
persons
who
are
capable
of
electing
a
majority
in
the
united
states
senate,
or
should
it
be
43.3%,
the
number
of
persons
residing
in
39
states
who
could
cast
a
majority
of
the
electoral
votes
for
president.
now,
the
three-judge
court
in
the
georgia
legislative
apportionment
case
held
that
a
theoretical
minimum
of
22%
for
both
houses
was
invidiously
discriminatory
and
that
one
house
at
least
had
to
be
proportionate
to
population.
upon
remand
in
the
baker
case,
the
district
court
invalidated
minimums
of
26.9
for
the
senate
and
28.7
for
the
house.
in
new
york
on
the
other
hand,
theoretical
minimums
of
36.9%
for
the
senate
and
38.2%
for
the
house
were
up
held.
the
idaho
court
in
caesar
versus
williams
upheld
a
minimum
of
32.7
which
by
the
way
is
substantially
the
theoretical
minimum
under
the
1962
revised
county
unit
law.
colorado
minimums
of
29.8
for
the
house
and
32.1
for
the
senate
were
held
invalid.
but
in
none
of
these
cases,
as
any
court
undertake
it
to
say
just
where
this
line
can
be
drawn
and
the
reading
of
the
opinions
leaves
you
completely
helpless
in
trying
to
discern
from
there
any
ascertainable
standard
or
formula.
or,
there's
another
method
that
you
could
use
and
evaluate.
that's
the
mathematical
ratio,
the
comparison
of
one
political
entity
to
another
that
can
be
compared
to
either
the
most
disproportionate
or
the
least
populous
unit
or
it
can
be
compared
to
an
average
unit.
and
applied
to
the
georgia
county
unit
system,
it
results
that
the
ratio
of
fulton
county,
the
state's
largest
county,
the
echols
county,
the
smallest
county
is
14.8
to
1.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
the
court
below
held
that
the
comparison
should
be
from
the
particular
county
to
the
average
county
of
their
ratio
would
be
approximately
1.93
to
1.
baker
versus
carr,
the
courts
validated
an
apportionment
which
gave
ratios
to
largest
to
the
smallest
of
7
to
1
for
the
senate,
23
to
1
for
the
house.
there
were
some
variations
in
alabama
that
got
involved
there
on
the
problem
of
the
fact
that
one
house
could
not
be
completely
proportionate
to
population.
under
the
electoral
college,
the
ratio
of
new
york
to
alaska
runs
8
to
1
as
to
eligible
voters
and
5
to
1
with
regard
to
population.
the
ratio
of
the
average
congressional
district
to
alaska
which
is
one
congressional
district
is
approximately
2
to
1
not
5
to
1.
when
compared
with
senate
representation,
the
ratio
of
alaska
to
new
york
is
74
to
1
as
to
population
and
a
131
as
to
eligible
voters.
now,
there's
a
third
statistical
approach
and
that
is
suggested
by
the
american
society
of
political
--
the
american
political
science
society
and
that
is
comparing
the
percentage
departure
from
the
median
or
from
the
average
district
or
unit
as
involved
in
this
case.
the
science
association
recommends
a
maximum
departure
of
15%
for
congressional
districts.
representative
celler
has
recommended
20%
in
some
legislation
he
has
proposed
and
senator
clark
who
apparently
was
inspired
by
mr.
anthony
lewis'
article
in
the
harvard
law
review
has
proposed
a
50%
maximum
deviation
from
the
average
district.
now
this
is
simply
a
preview,
a
prelude
of
things
to
come.
if
this
court
or
any
other
court
gets
itself
in
the
position
or
trying
to
evaluate,
to
set
formulas,
to
draw
lines
that
is
not
the
solid
stuff
that
is
traditional
to
the
judicial
system.
they
are
no
judiciable
manageable
standards
by
which
you
can
evaluate
such
a
situation.
i
would
certainly
hate
to
think
that
this
court
or
any
other
court
should
get
itself
in
the
position
that
the
swiss
federal
tribunal
did
recently,
when
they
undertook
to
draw
lines
and
they
struck
down
a
coram
limitation
on
its
proportionate
system
of
apportioning
representation
by
holding
that
a
6.6%
coram
limitation
was
valid,
whereas
a
12.4%
limitation
was
invalid.
they
didn't
tell
us
approximately
what
point
it
becomes
permissible
or
unconstitutional.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
nothing
except
that
the
express
desire
of
his
law
making
power
was
frustrated.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
it's
the
will
of
the
people,
the
legislature,
they're
supposing
they
represent
the
will
of
the
people,
they
provide
it
otherwise.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
the
argument
i
think
that
--
of
the
question
that
you
asked
presupposes,
does
it
not,
that
equality
of
representation
is
the
only
basis
of
representation.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
would
have,
except
it
would
not
have
been
a
run-off
as
i
recall
in
the
race
for
lieutenant
governor.
he
would
have
been
elected
on
the
first
ballot.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right.
so
there
--
there
would've
been
a
difference
in
the
--
one
of
the
congressional
districts,
of
course
that's
not
imposed
by
state
law.
it
--
i
wouldn't
--
well,
i
say
this,
it
would
--
under
the
old
system,
it
would
have
been
--
there
would
have
been
a
difference
under
the
new
--
under
the
new
system.
of
course,
it
was
abandoned
before
but
a
successful
candidate
would
have
won
anyway
under
the
new
system.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
which
old
system?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
if
this
court
had
not
decided
baker
versus
carr,
my
guess
would
be
that
we
would
have
probably
applied
it,
but
i
have
no
--
there
had
been
a
move
a
foot
to
get
it
--
to
bring
it
up
to
fall
of
what
it
was
at
the
time
it
was
originally
not
enacted
in
the
law
in
1970.
now,
in
all
candor,
i
think
i
should
say
that
i
do
not
think
it
would
have
taken
place
last
year
if
it
had
not
been
for
baker
versus
carr.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
right
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
casting
of
--
i
would
--
i
would
have
to
analyze
that
mathematically,
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
give
you
the
same
result.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
might.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
essentially,
yes
it
is.
i
will
not
say
that
i
could
--
i'm
not
enough
a
mathematician
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
not
--
not
just
with
that
language
because
it
doesn't
work
that
way
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
would
be
perfect
for
that.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
perfectly
balanced.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
history
has
because
the
--
this
court
has
held
time
in
time
again
that
history
and
the
traditions
of
the
people
have
some
influence,
it's
not
controlling
but
it
has
some
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it
was
to
some
extent
when
the
people
first
started
moving
out
of
the
tidewater
areas
out
into
the
country.
we
had
that
problem
in
georgia,
the
coastal
counties
which
were
the
--
you
might
say
the
urban
areas
were
over
represented
at
that
time.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
think
i
could
express
it
any
better
than
--
was
expressed
by
the
court
in
macdougall
versus
green,
that
the
desire
to
disperse,
to
diffuse
political
power,
to
prevent
people
in
concentrated
areas
from
--
you
have
a
community
of
interest,
you
have
opportunities
who
have
all
of
the
mass
media
of
communication
available
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
how
is
that
sir?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that's
what
we're
arguing,
i
think.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
diffusion
is
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it's
not
the
diffusion
we
usually
think
of
in
terms
of
macdougall
versus
green.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i'm
coming
--
i
--
i'm
going
to
touch
on
that
with
different
methods
of
apportionment.
even
after
you
take
into
account
the
different
methods
of
representation
of
mathematical
computation,
you
then
have
a
problem
of
what
political
scientists
referred
to
as
unofficial
apportionments
where
these
extra
legal
forces
that
rise
up
to
neutralize
--
the
juror
apportionments
such
as
lobbies,
and
pressure
groups,
and
reapportioning
of
the
state
senate.
we
came
across
one
aspect
of
that
as
originally
drawn
out
of
scenic
districts,
achieved
a
remarkable
degree
of
equality,
they
didn't
vary
more
than
10%.
but
when
it
got
in
the
legislature,
some
people
in
one
county
said,
we
don't
want
to
be
with
this
group,
we
rather
go
in
this
other
county,
even
though
there's
no
other
adjustments
made
to
--
to
alleviate
the
inequality
that
results.
we
have
more
community
of
interest
with
this
particular
group
of
counties
over
here.
that
--
that
in
our
mind
subordinates
any
considerations
of
abstract
equality.
now,
the
second
proposition
that
follows
from
the
idea
that
equal
population
representation
is
not
the
only
basis
is
that
this
court
cannot
pick
and
choose
between
conflicting
bases
of
representation.
the
oldest
--
one
of
the
oldest
at
least
is
political
unit
apportionment
which
is
exactly
what
georgia
has
employed
here,
apportionment
according
to
political
units.
we
have
superimposed
the
population
bracket
on
top
of
it
to
give
it
some
aspect
of
equality,
but
political
unit
apportionment
is
one
of
the
oldest.
another
is
of
course
the
functional
division
apportionment,
william
and
mary
college
elected
its
own
representatives
as
did
the
english
universities.
another
type
of
functional
division
apportionment
has
been
suggested
recently
by
one
commentator
who
says
that
we
are
developing
cleavages
in
the
urban
areas
that
transcend
urban
and
rural
lives,
that
the
rise
of
labor
unions
on
one
hand
and
employers
on
the
other
might
some
day
make
it
desirable
to
apportion
representatives
along
functional
divisions
of
the
population
in
order
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
how
is
that
sir?
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
many
european
countries
i
think
have
followed
that,
particularly
in
austria
and
in
that
area.
another
method
of
representation
was
suggested
by
john
stuart
mill
who
advocated
the
quotient
system
of
apportionment,
a
pre-population
allowance,
that's
in
vogue
in
europe.
we
say
that
the
court
is
not
equipped
to
make
the
policy
choices
between
these
conflicting
bases.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
adjudicate
that
a
particular
basis
is
not
permissible
without
at
the
same
time
adjudicating
what
is
a
republican
form
of
government.
i
recognize
the
distinctions
made
in
the
baker
versus
carr
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
it
goes
against
it.
i
--
and
i
recall
the
distinction
made,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
this
that
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
don't
--
i
don't
see
how
you
can
avoid
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
get
down
to
this
that
you
cannot
determine
whether
a
particular
deviation
or
departure
from
equality
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
unless
you
first
postulate
what
is
the
norm
and
when
you
have
once
postulated
the
norm,
it
seems
to
me
that
--
i
can't
see
any
difference
in
standard
that
would
be
compatible
with
equal
protection
and
yet
not
at
the
same
time
represent
a
republican
form
of
government
or
vice
versa.
there
may
be,
i
--
but
i
fail
to
see
it.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
may
be
i
can
come
to
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
think
i
can
come
to
the
heart
of
the
forum,
and
i
say
this,
we
think
that
the
true
test
is
not
the
court
to
pick
and
choose
between
conflicting
basis
of
representation,
either
legislative,
diffusion
of
electoral
power
and
state
house
offices
or
otherwise.
the
true
test
is,
it's
the
court
--
is
to
tell
them
whether
there's
any
recognizable
basis
there.
if
there's
any
basis
at
all,
then
i
think
that
ends
it
and
there
are
some
of
course
that
obviously
are
impermissible,
race,
sex,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
if
a
particular
system
reflects
a
recognizable,
identifiable
expression
of
policy,
and
it's
a
policy
that
is
certainly
had
some
recognition
in
governmental
structure,
i
think
the
function
of
the
courts
should
end
there.
and
they
should
not
go
into
weighting,
and
as
the
government
would
suggest,
determine
whether
there's
only
a
moderate
departure
from
per
capita
equality
and
all
of
the
drawing
of
lines
that
that
would
entail.
and
we
say
that
the
georgia
system
does
have
a
recognizable
basis
and
that
is
as
far
as
the
matter
should
go.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
i
have
got
3
minutes,
i
believe.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
please
the
court.
i
think
the
seventeenth
amendment
in
this
case
proves
too
much.
because
if
it
is
true,
if
it
is
a
correct
position.
the
result
would
necessarily
follow
that
in
any
state
where
nomination
was
tantamount
to
election,
you
could
not
nominate
by
a
convention.
reference
was
made
to
some
state
constitution
provisions
defining
the
right
to
vote.
the
georgia
supreme
court
held
in
cox
versus
peters
that
they
related
only
to
the
general
election
and
not
to
the
primary,
that's
binding
on
this
court
as
far
as
with
reference
to
state
law.
a
statement
was
also
made
that
the
winning
candidate
for
governor
was
induced
to
run
by
virtue
of
the
county
unit
system
being
stricken
down.
that
simply
is
not
so.
i
don't
want
to
involve
myself
in
personalities,
but
i
think
i
know
where
of
--
i
speak
in
that
regard.
so
also
to
suggest
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
mr.
abram
stated
in
his
argument
that
the
successful
candidate
for
governor
in
georgia
in
--
of
a
1962
general
election
was
encouraged
to
run
because
of
invalidation
of
the
county
unit
system
in
the
court
case
below
and
i
simply
said
that
was
not
so.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
no
sir.
i
hope
not.
next,
we
have
not
suggested
as
has
been
stated
by
reference
to
parrington
and
by
the
way
i
forgot
the
“h”
instead
of
a
“p”
there,
it
should
have
been
harrington,
that
the
county
unit
system
is
based
on
the
economic
basis
of
apportionment.
we
say
that
it's
based
on
political
unit
apportionment,
not
geographically,
but
its
political
unit
apportionment.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
position
of
the
state
is
that
in
it
--
that
these
things
of
those
features
which
tend
to
give
these
concentrated
areas
of
population
in
an
inordinate
amount
of
power
by
virtue
of
the
fact
of
the
concentrated
numbers,
that
that
--
the
state
can
take
those
matters
into
account.
and
i
think
that's
always
been
the
basis
upon
which
this
type
of
apportionment
has
been
explained.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
you
there
are
getting
into
valued
judgments
in
which
the
court
is
called
upon
to
evaluate
and
apply
its
policy
judgments
no
differently
than
the
court
a
few
generations
ago
did
in
lochner
versus
new
york.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
it's
not
just
because
you're
in
the
labor
union,
but
if
you
live
in
an
area
of
concentrated
population
density
where
there
are
avenues
for
communication,
where
the
mass
media
of
communication
can
organize
people
along
much
more
cohesive
groupings
than
you
have
in
the
rural
areas.
we
think
that
those
disparities
in
power
are
just
as
relevant
when
a
state
comes
to
apportion
its
electrical
--
its
electoral
power,
as
are
the
disparities
in
bargaining
when
congress
passed
a
(inaudible).
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
that
is
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
one
--
one
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
person,
one
vote.
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
and
as
to
the
--
mr.
e.
freeman
leverett
--
chief
justice
--
the
question
of
the
chief
justice
which
i
think
relates
to
what
you
have
posited
now
mr.
justice
stewart,
you
do
not
have
to
go
to
districting
to
--
in
your
legislative
area
because
you
can
get
perfect
equality
of
voting
power
in
a
legislative
situation
simply
by
doing
the
same
thing
that
was
done
with
respect
to
congress
in
many
states
until
1842
when
districting
came,
required
by
act
of
congress.
you
could
have
a
state
at
large
election
and
have
perfect
equality.
but
in
order
to
get
a
diffusion,
in
order
to
give
recognition
to
local
interest,
you
district
a
state
and
then
it's
where
your
inequalities
come
into.
macdougall,
we
say
as
our
case,
i
think
it
states
very
eloquently
the
reasons,
the
basis
that
we
say
this
county
unit
system
should
be
upheld.
we
put
in
our
answer,
our
verified
answers
at
page
72
to
73
of
the
record
and
it
has
just
as
much
probative
value
as
the
opinionated
affidavits
that
the
other
party
put
in.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that's
--
my
time
is
up
so,
i
appreciate
the
court's
indulgence.
