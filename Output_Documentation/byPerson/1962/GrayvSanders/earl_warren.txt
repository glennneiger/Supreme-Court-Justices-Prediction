general
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
just
going
to
ask
general,
do
you
believe
that
there
is
any
place
in
a
state
system
of
voting
for
weighting
the
votes
in
the
general
elections
for
senator
or
governor
or
the
general
state
offices?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
one
situation,
in
the
legislative
situation,
you
have
representations,
but
when
you
have
a
statewide
election,
you
--
there's
no
necessity
for
weighting
votes.
they
--
you
vote
for
one
office
to
represent
not
the
districts
but
minorities
or
majorities
but
to
represent
the
entire
state,
is
that
the
--
isn't
that
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
difference
between
the
two,
general?
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
in
georgia,
is
there
any
power
in
the
people
to
initiate
a
constitutional
amendment
or
must
it
come
from
the
legislation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
must
come
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
from
the
legislature
itself.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
have,
(inaudible)
--
go
right
ahead.
