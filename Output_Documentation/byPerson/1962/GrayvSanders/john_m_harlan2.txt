the
court
did
not
strike
down
the
money
as
such,
did
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
there
any
legislative
debates
on
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
general,
do
you
--
do
you
--
do
you
--
the
district
court
as
i
read
its
opinion
did
not
strike
down
the
county
unit
system
as
such
like
it
was
careful
to
say
that
it
was
not
doing
so.
do
you
--
does
the
government's
position
is
if
the
--
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
system
as
such
is
unconstitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
--
what
you're
suggesting
as
i
understand
it
is
that
the
district
court's
decree
in
its
advisory
apportion,
as
that
term
is
used
that
it
would
be
modified
by
striking
those
out
--
those
provisions
out
that
the
present
county
unit
system
as
applied
so
to
speak,
as
devised
should
be
struck.
and
without
any
indication
as
to
what
might
meet
the
court
or
that
it
might
meet
the
constitutional
standards
if
the
legislature
re-met
and
substituted
four
instead
of
three
and
five
instead
of
six,

justice
john

is
that
--
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
also
(voice

--
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
i
thought
you
recognized
that
the
urban
country
consideration
was
a
factor
that
could
be
taken
into
account,
didn't
have
to
be
scooted
per
se,
but
that
it
was
over-weighted
here
or
as
applied
here,
it
was
enough
reason
for
discrimination.
justice
john
m.
