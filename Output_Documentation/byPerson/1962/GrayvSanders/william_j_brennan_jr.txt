justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
murphy,
now
that
you've
tried
the
popular
primary,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
party
would
like
to
return,
nevertheless,
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
county
unit
system.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
suggesting
that
it
intended
to
return.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
without
suggesting
that
it
intended
to
return.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
had
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you
say
none
should
be
submitted,
speaking
now
only
with
primary
elections?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
understand.
would
you
apply
it
necessarily?
you
don't
have
to
(inaudible)
as
a
matter
of
legislative
representation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
why
--
that's
why
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
whatever
it
might
be
in
the
area
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
legislative
representation,
in
this
area
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
position
is
that
there
ought
to
be
no
weighting
of
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you're
right
mr.
abram,
on
this
record,
i
gather
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
whether
unit
system
per
se
violates
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
per
se.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
abram,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you
on
this
point,
would
that
be
enough
to
dispose
of
this
case
without
touching
the
state
office?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
quite
right
mr.
abram
that
it's
the
same
statute
that
applies
to
the
united
states
senator
and
the
others.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
we
agreed
with
your
argument
regarding
the
united
states
senator,
wouldn't
that
be
sufficient
to
affirm
this
injunction
without
referring
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
you
don't
--
would
be
back
here
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
attorney
general,
is
the
--
what
was
--
what
is
the
government's
view
if
we
were
to
agree
with
the
argument
addressed
in
the
seventeenth
amendment
as
--
respects
to
nominations
for
the
united
states
senate
and
can
sustain
the
injunction
addressed
to
the
statute
on
that
ground.
would
the
government
think
we
ought
to
reach
all
these
other
questions
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
a
suggestion
then
that
indeed
we
can't
dispose
of
the
case
only
on
the
seventeenth
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
essentially,
it
is
a
rural-urban
discrimination
in
the
government?
