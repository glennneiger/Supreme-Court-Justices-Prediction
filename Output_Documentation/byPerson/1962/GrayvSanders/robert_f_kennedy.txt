mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
state
the
interest
of
the
united
states
in
this
case.
declaration
of
independent
states
a
principle
which
is
basic
to
our
american
way
of
life,
namely
that
governments
derive
their
just
powers
from
the
consent
of
the
people.
in
periodic
elections
here
in
the
united
states,
we
select
our
leaders.
if
we
become
dissatisfied,
we
select
new
leaders.
so
therefore,
the
free
and
unencumbered
exercise
with
a
franchise
is
basic
to
american
system.
we
believe
that
this
free
and
unencumbered
exercise
with
the
franchise
is
under
serious
challenge
in
an
arbitrary,
capricious
and
discriminatory
fashion
in
the
state
of
georgia.
but
we
believe
that
this
evil
is
not
confined
to
the
state
of
georgia
as
the
court
heard
in
the
tennessee
cases
last
term.
districts
have
been
so
arranged
in
certain
areas
of
the
united
states
that
an
individual
in
one
area
has
10,
15,
50
or
100
times
the
vote
strength
of
an
individual
in
another
area.
the
united
states
government
has
a
responsibility
to
do
all
in
its
power
to
ensure
that
those
who
have
been
disfranchised
in
whole
or
in
part
that
that
right
is
restored
to
them.
that
in
this
effort
to
also
restore
some
confidence
in
representative
government
where
this
kind
of
practices
exists.
in
baker
versus
carr,
this
court
has
determined
that
the
weighing
or
dilution
of
votes
through
malapportionment
was
justiciable
in
the
federal
courts
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
is
the
first
case
in
which
the
court
has
been
asked
to
pass
upon
the
major
substantive
constitutional
issue.
therefore,
the
principles
enunciated
in
this
case
will
have
an
effect
on
millions
of
americans
who
have
been
deprived
in
whole
or
in
part
of
their
franchise.
the
issues
involved
in
this
case
really
are
relatively
simple.
first,
as
far
as
the
facts
are
concerned,
there
has
been
a
gross
and
arbitrary
discrimination
against
the
voters
who
live
in
the
urban
areas
in
favor
of
those
who
live
in
rural
areas.
and
number
two
that
that
gross
discrimination
is
in
violation
of
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
beyond
that,
we
don't
feel
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
go.
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
the
court
to
accept
some
hypothetical
variant
to
this
system
which
the
georgia
legislature
may
pass
in
the
future.
we
don't
think
that
the
court
should
limit
its
future
actions
in
this
field
by
accepting
a
standards
--
standard
which
may
or
may
not
be
applicable
to
other
states
under
other
circumstances
in
other
parts
of
the
union.
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
discrimination
is
gross,
but
before
i
get
into
a
discussion
of
that,
i
would
like
to
discuss
just
briefly
about
what
we
feel
the
scope
of
this
case
is
in
view
with
some
of
the
questions
that
has
been
raised.
first,
we
are
not
against
a
county
unit
system
as
such.
we
are
against
the
georgia
county
unit
system
because
it
discriminates
against
those
who
live
in
urban
areas
in
favor
of
those
who
live
in
rural
areas.
and
number
two,
we're
not
saying
or
contending
that
under
all
circumstances
in
every
situation,
that
every
vote
must
be
given
equal
weight.
if
you
have
a
unit
system
or
if
you
have
a
representative
form
of
government
with
representatives
that
elected
to
the
legislature
other
than
statewide
election,
you're
bound
to
have
some
departure
from
exact
equality.
further,
there
are
other
theories
of
representation.
you
might
take
into
consideration
geography,
you
might
take
into
consideration
historical
background
and
you
might
take
into
consideration
economic
interests
and
a
number
of
other
matters.
these
kinds
of
departures
--
perhaps
they
are
harmless
or
perhaps
they
are
necessary
or
perhaps
are
unavoidable.
the
fact
is
in
the
georgia
county
unit
system
however
that
the
departures
are
not
harmless,
are
not
unavoidable
and
are
not
necessary.
further,
i
think
that
we
should
remember
that
we
are
considering
here
a
statewide
election
for
statewide
offices.
we're
not
--
we
don't
have
to
get
really
involved
in
various
theories
of
representation.
here
is
one
man,
one
vote.
you
can
have
equality.
we
feel
that,
however,
if
you
depart
at
all
from
this
equality
that
it
should
meet
the
most
exacting
test,
it
should
be
subject
to
the
most
exacting
test
and
that
we
feel
at
a
minimum
that
test
should
be
--
that
the
departure
should
be
minimal.
and
number
two
that
it
should
be
--
to
further
some
part
of
the
elective
process.
we
feel
that
what
has
happened
in
the
state
of
georgia
under
the
georgia
county
unit
system
is
not
a
departure
that
is
minimal,
is
not
harmless.
let
me
just
give
you
some
examples.
if
you
live
in
one
of
the
eleven
smallest
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia,
your
vote
is
worth
seven-and-a-half
times
an
individual
who
lives
in
one
of
the
four
larger
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia.
if
you
live
in
savannah,
georgia,
your
vote
is
worth
four
times
if
--
if
the
--
you
have
to
get
four
votes
in
savannah,
georgia
to
offset
one
vote
in
glascock
county,
georgia.
if
you
live
in
fulton
county,
georgia
with
atlanta,
you
have
to
get
14
votes
to
offset
one
vote
in
echols
county.
a
third
of
the
populations
living
in
the
smallest
county
in
the
state
of
georgia
have
a
majority
of
the
unit
votes.
we
used
to
have,
and
i
repeat
used
to
have,
a
saying
in
my
city
of
boston
which
was
vote
early,
and
vote
often.
if
--
if
you
live
in
one
of
the
small
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia,
all
you
have
to
do
is
vote
early
and
you
accomplish
the
same
result.
conversely,
a
majority
of
the
population
living
in
the
larger
counties
in
the
city
--
in
the
state
of
georgia
have
only
a
third
of
the
unit
votes.
if
you
live
in
one
of
the
large
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia,
you've
got
one
unit
vote
for
every
12,889
people.
if
you
live
in
one
of
the
smaller
counties,
one
of
the
eleven
smaller
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia,
you
have
one
unit
vote
for
every
17,115
people.
if
you
live
in
one
of
the
116
of
the
smallest
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia,
you
have
251
unit
votes.
but
the
same
population
in
the
four
largest
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia,
approximately
the
same
population
has
only
90
votes,
a
discrimination
of
almost
three
to
one.
now,
this
is
--
this
kind
of
discrimination
is
unfair
as
giving
everybody
who
lives
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
state
10
votes
for
every
person
who
lives
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
or
people
who
have
red
hair
five
times
their
vote
value
of
those
who
have
blond
hair
or
those
who
have
white
skins,
10
times
the
vote
of
those
who
have
dark
skin.
and
this
voting
disparity
has
had
a
major
result
in
the
state
of
georgia.
if
you're
living
in
fulton
county,
you
pay
--
in
1960
you
paid
about
$80
million
in
taxes
to
the
state
of
georgia.
that
from
the
state
of
georgia
to
fulton
county
came
approximately
$22
million.
the
other
$59
million
was
used
elsewhere
in
the
state
of
georgia
mostly
for
the
smaller
counties.
if
you
live
in
one
of
the
seven
largest
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia,
you
paid
in
1960
a
$160
million
worth
of
taxes,
$60
million
of
that
was
used
elsewhere
in
the
state,
$60
million,
excuse
me,
was
used
in
those
eleven
counties.
the
rest
of
it,
the
$100
million
was
used
elsewhere
in
the
state.
now,
what
happens
in
echols
county?
echols
county
paid
$82,000
in
taxes
in
1960,
but
they
received
back
from
the
state
$280,000.
if
you
live
in
one
of
the
eleven
smallest
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia,
in
1960,
you
paid
$2
million
in
taxes
to
the
state
of
georgia,
back
from
the
state
however,
you
received
$4,500,000
in
taxes.
a
person
living
in
fulton
county,
the
state
there
--
the
county
there
pays
$3.66
for
every
dollar
they
received
back
from
the
state.
but
if
you
live
in
echols
county,
you
receive
back
from
the
state
$3.40
for
every
dollar
that
you
paid
in.
the
per
capita
tax
in
one
of
the
largest
--
in
the
largest
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia
in
1960
was
$77
per
capita.
in
the
smallest
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia,
it
was
$19
per
capita.
and
yet
what
you
received
back
from
the
state
of
georgia,
if
you
lived
in
one
of
the
largest
counties
in
the
state
of
georgia,
you
at
least
received
back
$22
per
capita
and
if
you
lived
in
one
of
the
largest
counties,
you
received
back
$69
per
capita.
well,
i'm
not
contending
here
that
this
money
that
was
used
by
the
state
of
the
georgia
in
these
smallest
counties
was
not
for
good
purposes.
i'm
not
contending
that
there
should
not
have
been
perhaps
some
discrimination
between
the
taxes
that
were
being
paid
by
the
larger
counties
and
the
smaller
counties
because
the
larger
counties
are
better
off
financially.
but
i
do
say
that
if
you're
--
if
the
large
counties
of
the
state
of
georgia
are
going
to
pay
the
bills
for
the
small
counties,
certainly
their
vote
should
count
as
much.
certainly
when
you
consider
what
has
happened
in
fulton
county
and
echols
county,
a
vote
in
echols
county
being
worth
14
times
the
amount
of
the
vote
in
fulton
county.
we
hear
and
we
talk
a
great
deal
about
state's
rights,
but
to
turn
the
coin
of
state's
rights
over
and
you
get
state's
responsibilities.
there
are
many
things
that
need
to
be
done
in
the
major
metropolitan
areas
of
the
united
states
or
problems
of
the
urban
renewal,
of
the
purification
of
water,
of
transportation,
of
education,
of
juvenile
delinquency
and
many
of
these
problems
are
being
ignored.
and
while
you
have
a
system
as
you
have
in
the
state
of
georgia
or
on
the
georgia
county
unit
system
where
there
is
the
great
advantage
for
those
who
live
in
the
rural
areas
in
favor
of
those
who
live
in
the
urban
area.
the
people
in
the
urban
areas
are
always
going
to
figure
and
figure
correctly
that
they
are
second
class
citizens
and
those
in
the
rural
areas
are
the
ones
that
are
going
to
reign
supreme.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
for
us
to
reach
that
point.
i
do
say
that
although
i
have
given
it
a
great
deal
of
thought,
i
have
difficulty
coming
up
with
any
system
that
makes
any
sense
which
is
a
unit
voting
in
connection
with
a
statewide
election.
as
i
say,
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
reach
that
point
and
as
i
said
a
little
bit
earlier,
what
we
are
contending
here
is
about
the
georgia
county
unit
system.
but
i
do
have
a
difficult
time
coming
up
with
any
meaningful
unit
vote
as
far
as
the
statewide
elections
go.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
yes,
yes.
because
the
order
goes
beyond
--
the
order
of
the
lower
court
goes
beyond
just
the
election
of
the
united
states
senator,
mr.
justice.
and
what
is
involved
here
is
a
statewide
election
for
all
of
these
other
offices
and
i
--
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
no,
we
do
not.
we
don't
think
that
it's
necessary
to
reach
that.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
now,
the
justification
that
has
been
offered
for
this
discriminatory
system
is
that
those
in
the
rural
areas
are
not
as
able
--
well-able
to
organize
themselves
that
they
don't
--
they
are
not
as
articulate
as
far
as
politics
is
concerned
and
they
don't
take
as
active
interest
in
politics.
i
think
that
that
contention
does
not
bear
upon
to
the
facts.
i
think
that
anybody
that
is
in
public
life
that
has
represented
a
rural
area
is
found
that
his
constituents
are
articulate,
are
vocal,
are
strong
and
well-able
to
take
care
of
themselves.
i
think
that
the
statistics
at
least
of
the
elections
in
the
last
few
years
have
shown
that
those
in
rural
areas
take
a
very
active
interest
in
politics.
for
instance,
in
the
1960
election,
the
--
it
was
five
states
which
were
primary
rule
in
the
united
states
which
led
all
the
others
as
far
as
vote
participation.
idaho
with
80.8%,
new
hampshire
with
80.6%,
utah
with
80%
and
the
two
north
dakota
and
south
dakota
with
approximately
79%.
the
city
of
new
york,
59%
of
the
eligible
voters
voted
in
the
election
in
1960.
outside
the
city
of
new
york,
however,
was
77%.
approximately
50%
of
the
people
in
newark,
new
jersey
voted
in
the
election,
but
outside
the
city
of
newark,
the
percentage
was
far,
far
higher.
in
illinois,
the
vote
in
the
down
state
counties
of
illinois,
the
rural
county
was
much
higher
by
and
large
than
the
wards
of
cook
county,
chicago,
illinois.
the
contention
is
what
they'd
--
that
they
don't
vote
as
much
as
a
block.
they
don't
vote
as
much
as
a
unit.
they
don't
get
together
as
much.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
borne
out
either.
of
the
75
counties
in
the
1960
election
in
the
united
states
which
voted
for
more
than
80%
for
one
candidate
or
another,
all
but
one
of
those
75
counties
was
a
--
had
a
population
of
less
than
50,000.
but
even
assuming
--
even
assuming
that
this
contention
was
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
still
don't
think
that
it
bears
up.
it's
a
--
we
put
a
great
premium
in
united
states
on
participation
in
elections,
getting
together
and
organizing
them.
and
if
we
--
if
the
state
of
georgia
can
penalize
those
who
are
well-organized,
there
is
nothing
to
prohibit
a
state
from
penalizing
the
members
of
the
american
medical
association
for
being
better
organized
and
housewives
for
instance.
or
even
members
of
labor
organizations
because
they
happened
to
be
better
organized
than
say,
some
other
group.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
i
don't
think
it
would
be
constitutional
and
i
don't
think
that
would
be
wise.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
no,
the
government's
position
of
that
subject
that
does
not
have
to
be
reached
by
the
court.
we
can
think
that
this
county
unit
system
should
be
struck
down
as
it's
been
put
into
operation.
we
don't
think
that
the
court
need
approved,
as
i
said,
some
other
system
which
may
or
may
not
be
put
into
operation
by
the
state
of
georgia.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
that's
correct.
we
think
that
if
the
--
it's
--
be
clear
and
starting
really
with
the
tennessee
reapportionment
case
and
we
hope
in
this
case
that
what
the
ideal
is,
one
man,
one
vote.
that
number
two,
that
if
there
is
any
variation
of
this
that
it
has
to
be
to
further
the
elective
process,
that
idea
can
be
followed
by
states.
the
reasonable
men
in
our
state
legislatures
and
those
who
have
the
responsibilities
in
our
state
can
follow
that.
we
don't
think
to
try
--
if
--
or
the
court
to
attempt
to
set
up
a
standard
which
is
going
to
be
applicable
in
massachusetts
and
california
and
the
state
of
washington
and
florida
or
in
texas
is
impossible.
these
people
know
their
states.
they
know
what
the
history
and
the
background
of
it
is.
they
can
pass
a
law
which
would
be
discriminatory.
we
feel
that
what
has
happened
in
the
state
of
georgia
that
this
is
discriminatory.
but
i
think
as
a
men
of
good
will
that
they
will
make
an
effort
by
and
large
throughout
the
state
to
pass
a
law
which
is
their,
an
equitable
law
for
the
citizens
now
that
the
supreme
court
has
passed
on
this
matter.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
no,
because
we
have
the
courage
of
it
mr.
justice.
we
just
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
say
at
the
moment.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
and
we
state
that
this
county
unit
system
is
invidious.
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice,
i
said
that
i
couldn't
--
i
could
not
give
you
a
description
of
one
that
does
not
raise
all
kinds
of
problems,
but
i
--
there
might
be
a
state
where
the
lawmakers
for
historical
reasons,
geography,
for
other
factors
that
i'm
not
aware
of
at
the
moment
who
could
come
up
with
a
unit
system
which
would
make
some
sense.
so,
for
--
i
just
think
that
it's
not
necessary
to
go
beyond
--
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
i
cannot
conceive
it.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
i
don't
think
it's
a
crazy
quilt.
mr.
abram
has
pointed
out
that
there
were
discriminations
within
groups,
but
i
think
that
as
a
general
proposition
that
this
is
a
systematic
discrimination
and
i
think
it's
been
the
--
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
that's
correct,
in
favor
of
those
who
live
in
rural
areas
and
against
those
who
--
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
that's
correct.
in
favor
of
those
who
live
in
urban
--
in
rural
areas
against
those
who
live
on
--
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
well,
i
think
that
it
can
certainly
in
--
if
you
were
having
a
representative
kind
of
election,
mr.
justice.
but
none
in
statewide
elections.
we
don't
think
that
this
is
in
furtherance
of
the
elective
process.
now,
as
i
say
that
this
discrimination
here
as
put
into
effect
is
gross
and
number
two,
that
it's
not
in
favor,
it's
not
--
does
not
further
the
elective
process.
those
--
that's
the
test
that
we
apply
to
any
kind
of
--
where
there
is
a
differentiation
in
the
weighing
of
voting.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
this
is
different.
as
has
been
pointed
out,
this
is
different
than
when
you
have
an
election
that
involves
a
representation
of
members
to
the
house,
to
the
legislature
up
to
the
upper
house
in
the
state.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
that's
correct.
and
the
--
another
justification
that
has
been
used
for
this
kind
of
practice
in
the
state
of
the
georgia
is
that
one
area
or
one
county
will
still
dominate
the
state
that
--
that
would
be
--
the
rest
of
these
voters
in
the
state
will
be
overwhelmed.
that
--
that's
--
really
doesn't
bear
up
because
the
biggest
county
in
the
state
of
georgia
is
fulton
county
with
only
14%
of
the
vote.
well
then
if
they
say
that's
the
geographical
area,
well,
the
dekalb
county
borders
which
is
the
next
biggest
county
borders
on
fulton
county,
but
the
rest
of
the
large
counties
are
spread
around
the
state.
for
instance,
the
third
biggest,
the
chatham
county
which
contains
savannah
which
is
on
the
east
coast
and
you
have
muscogee
county
which
is
the
fourth
largest
county,
and
that
is
on
the
west
side
of
the
state.
bibb
county
is
the
fifth
largest
and
that's
in
the
central
part
of
the
state
and
the
rest
of
them
are
all
spread
around.
so
it's
not
any
geographical
group
that
could
so
dominate
or
control
the
state
which
would
cause
this
danger.
and
it's
hardly
a
justification
for
penalizing
those
who
live
in
these
major
metropolitan
areas,
penalizing
their
vote
strength
by
50%
and
rewarding
those
who
happen
to
be,
maybe
who
live
just
a
few
miles
away
in
a
small
rural
county
who
is
only
comparative
virtue
appears
to
be
that
they
live
in
a
area
that
has
a
small
population.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
so,
i
think
that
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
yes
it
is.
that
gets
--
when
you
consider
that
factor,
it
gets
into
many
other
problems
which
are
not
involved
here.
there
are
some
counties,
that
rural
counties
which
vote
a
very
high
percentage
of
their
population.
frequently,
they
have
a
low
negro
population.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
the
one
that
have
--
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
it's
not
very
large.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
in
any
county.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
not
any
--
it's
not
in
(inaudible)
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
there
is
not.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
must
come
from
the
legislature.
mr.
robert
f.
kennedy
now,
it's
a
--
didn't
argued
also
that
this
is
comparable
to
the
electoral
college,
mr.
chief
justice
and
that
you
have
some
variance
in
the
electoral
college
and
so
that
therefore
you
should
also
have
it
here
or
can
have
it
here.
i
don't
think
that
really
bears
up.
i
don't
think
the
analogy
is
correct
because
there
is
a
far
difference,
a
great
difference
between
the
states
who
gave
up
their
sovereignty
and
there
were
concessions
made.
when
they
gave
up
their
sovereignty
to
create
the
united
states,
one
of
the
concessions
that
was
made
to
them
was
the
fact
that
they
would
have
the
equivalent
vote
in
the
electoral
college,
equivalent
to
the
number
of
senators
had
--
they
had
plus
the
numbers
of
representatives
they
had.
now
this,
i
--
i'm
in
disagreement
with
the
brief
of
the
appellants
and
the
argument
of
the
appellants
that
this
was
all
like
problem
between
the
english
system
and
the
french
system
and
thomas
jefferson
and
adams
and
others
were
involved
in
determining
whether
they
really
believed
in
democracy
or
not.
there
wasn't
any
question
about
believing
in
democracy
but
the
struggle
at
that
time
was
between
the
large
states
and
the
small
states.
and
there
wasn't
anybody
that
contended
that
there
was
greater
democracy
in
one
state
over
another
state,
but
there
was
this
problem
between
large
states
and
the
small
states.
the
idea
that
there
was
this
english-french
system,
that
really
wasn't
taken
up,
i
don't
think
it's
borne
out
by
a
study
of
the
debate
of
the
constitutional
convention.
the
english-french
system
and
the
merits
of
them
were
taken
up
after
the
constitutional
convention
rather
the
--
it
might
be
that
there's
some
confusion
about
mr.
harrington,
mr.
harrington,
who
was
a
quoted,
lived
in
the
18th
century.
and
i
believe
that
quotes
come
from
mr.
parrington's
book
who
was
a
--
wrote
about
the
american
scene
in
the
20th
century.
so,
some
of
the
confusion
might
arise
out
of
that.
there
is
also
contended
that
we
don't
really
have
enough
cases
for
the
court
to
pass
on.
that
there
is
--
there
hasn't
been
enough
litigation
in
connection
with
this
matter
for
the
court
to
make
any
decision.
i
don't
think
that
that
bears
up
in
--
when
the
constitution
was
written,
we
didn't
have
decisions
on
due
process
or
commerce
between
the
states
or
freedom
of
speech,
but
we
made
important
progress
in
all
of
these
fields
under
the
general
umbrella
of
the
constitution
and
under
the
guidance
of
the
supreme
court.
when
george
washington
was
president,
you
didn't
have
railroads,
you
didn't
have
automobiles
let
alone
jet
aircraft.
but
the
great
miracle
of
the
constitution
is
that
we've
been
able
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
the
20th
century
as
well
as
the
problems
of
the
18th
century.
these
are
the
great
problems
that
are
facing
the
united
states
at
the
present
time.
and
this
kind
of
invidious
practice
that
exists
now
and
has
existed
before
and
the
georgia
county
unit
system
is
a
--
strikes
at
the
very
heart
of
the
united
states.
if
we
can
give
equal
protection
to
those
who
feel
that
they've
been
deprived
of
their
economic
rights,
certainly
we
can
give
equal
protection
to
those
who
have
been
deprived
of
the
most
basic
right
of
all
which
is
the
right
to
vote.
if
we
cannot
protect
them,
then
the
whole
fabric
of
american
the
system,
then
our
way
of
life
is
irreparably
damaged.
thank
you.
