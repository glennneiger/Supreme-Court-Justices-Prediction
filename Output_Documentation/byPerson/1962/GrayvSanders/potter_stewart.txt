justice
potter
stewart
general
murphy,
this
case
doesn't
involve
at
all,
at
least
certainly
doesn't
involve
directly,
that
the
system
under
which
your
3-2-1
–
your
3-2-1
system
for
election
of
the
state
house
representative?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
was
derivative.
it
was
derived
from
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
want
to
be
sure
in
my
--
so
i
can
understand
the
argument
as
we
go
on
that
we're
not
--
that
there's
not
involved
here
legislative
apportionment
as
such
at
all
for
your
state
legislature.
justice
potter
stewart
do
these
cases,
maybe
you've
told
us
and
i
don't
need
--
we
don't
need
to
know
in
detail,
but
do
these
cases
all
involve
the
same
issue
that's
involved
here,
that
is
the
election
of
statewide
executive
and
judicial
officers
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
or
were
some
of
them
de
--
were
some
of
them
an
attack
on
the
legislative
apportionment
system?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
all
of
a
piece
of
the
kind
of
litigation
we
have
before
us
now.
justice
potter
stewart
that
happens
with
the
one
who
got
the
highest
unit
votes
when
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
unit
votes?
justice
potter
stewart
a
majority
of
the
units?
justice
potter
stewart
the
position
of
the
government
of
that
part
of
the
court's
opinion
and
decree
should
be
excised.
would
you
agree
that
it
was
perhaps
unnecessary
to
the
decision
of
this
case
no
matter
how
it
was
decided,
whether
it
was
decided
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
really
all
that's
before
us,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
yes,
that's
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
it
--
but,
there
is
not
before
us
any
other
alternative
system,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
no
stay
was
requested
in
this
court,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
a
stay
requested
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
wouldn't
it
--
would
it
or
would
it
not
be
allowed
to
do
so
under
the
outstanding
injunction?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
think,
too.
justice
potter
stewart
it
just
relates
to
primary,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose,
under
that
injunction,
a
democratic
party,
if
it
wanted
to,
could
have
a
dozen
party
leaders
meet
in
the
smoke-filled
room
and
nominate
all
your
statewide
officials.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
all
the
republicans
in
georgia,
i
suppose.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
you
weren't
and
i
wasn't
--
well,
we
both
were
a
little
bit.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
general
murphy,
going
back
to
justice
white's
and
my
inquiry,
in
your
opinion,
it
would
not
be
a
violation
of
this
injunction
if
the
democratic
party
in
georgia
decided
to
have
a
few
party
leaders
and
nominate
the
state
officials,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
been
a
q
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
difficulty
with
your
argument
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
and
as
i
understand
it
tentatively
is
this
--
let's
take
the
case
of
the
united
states
senator.
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
itself
provides
what
--
what
district,
what
territory,
what
sovereignty
is
going
to
elect
a
united
states
senator
and
that
is
the
sovereign
state
of
the
united
states,
so
you
--
that
--
that
is
predetermined.
we
don't
have
here,
in
the
case
of
an
election
of
the
united
states
senator
any
problem
or
any
choice
of
the
state
to
divide
up
the
district?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
matter
of
districting
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
when
it
comes
to
it
because
this
is
--
this
has
all
been
decided
in
the
constitution
of
united
states,
it's
the
state
that's
the
unit.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
state
elects
the
united
states
senator?
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
i'm
just
suggesting
that
to
me
unlike
my
brother
white's
suggestion
as
i
got
it
from
his
question
that
this
a
quite
a
different
case
from
a
legislative
apportionment
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i'm
just
suggesting
that
the
problem
is
different?
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
what
we
have
before
us
here
is
an
amendment
of
that
constitution
which
was
adopted
about
almost
to
not
quite
100
years
afterwards,
that's
what's
before
us
here.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
constitution
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
that
contains
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
no
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
that
--
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
says,
the
specific
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution
save
it.
some
people
might
think
this
is
arbitrary
and
discriminatory,
but
it
is
certainly
--
there's
no
question
about
its
constitutionality
because
these
are
provided
and
we
all
know
without
going
into
it,
the
history
behind
all
that.
the
history
here
is
quite
a
different
history.
georgia
wasn't
created
by
several
counties
getting
together
and
voluntarily
giving
up
some
of
their
sovereignties
to
create
the
state
of
georgia.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
certain
with
respect
to
your
argument.
i
never
heard
that
the
legislature
is
terribly
upheld
here
so
far
as
representing
the
people
of
the
state.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
was
only
pointing
out
that
the
--
it's
hardly
to
be
presumed
that
the
law
as
provided
--
legislature
of
georgia
as
presently
apportioned,
at
least
its
house
of
representative
can
be
presumed
to
be
the
will
of
the
majority
of
the
people
of
georgia,
whether
it's
constitutional
or
not,
it's
a
different
question.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
i
--
perhaps
i'm
making
a
mistake
in
repeating
it,
but
at
least,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
your
argument
now
doesn't
go
to
the
problem
before
the
court
in
this
case.
we're
here
talking
about
--
not
about
legislative
apportionment
at
all.
we're
talking
about
the
election
of
the
united
states
or
the
--
of
the
nomination
by
--
in
a
one
party
state
of
a
united
states
senator
and
of
statewide
officials,
executive
and
judicial
as
i
understand
it.
we
don't
have
all
this
history.
the
fact
is
that
as
i
understand
the
briefs,
47
out
of
the
50
states
at
least
have
a
system
of
election
of
statewide
officials
which
is
based
on
one
man
--
one
voter
one
vote,
counted
equally.
you
don't
have
all
this
history
that
you
have
in
legislative
apportionment.
you
don't
have
all
the
problems
of
representative
government
in
a
state
legislature.
isn't
this
quite
a
different
kind
of
a
case
we
have?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
fifth
time
i've
asked
that
question,
i
shan't
ask
it
again.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
as
you've
indicated
the
--
as
you've
implicitly
indicated
that
a
state
is
not
without
power
to
discriminate
in
what
might
seem
an
arbitrary
way
among
voters
that
--
isn't
that
correct
that
georgia,
as
i
understand
you,
if
you're
18
years
old,
you
can
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
can't
vote
if
you're
17
years,
364
days
old?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
somebody
of
that
latter
age
might
think
it's
pretty
arbitrary?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
suppose
a
state
could
say
to
a
person
who's
lived
in
a
--
in
a
precinct
or
in
a
county
only
29
days
that
you
can't
vote
or
somebody
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
as
a
matter
of
your
state
constitution?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
this
would
be
a
--
this
would
be
a
terrible
political
liability
to
be
known
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
as
the
fellow
who
the
majority
of
the
people,
the
state
report
for
governor?
justice
potter
stewart
i've
heard
this
that
about
some
people
that
nobody
has
formed
but
the
people,
but
i
didn't
realize
that
it
was
such
a
terrible
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
not
make
any
–
you're
not
relying
on
the
fifteenth
amendment?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
what's
the
point
of
your
argument
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that's
your
argument
here
too.
justice
potter
stewart
so
why
do
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
state
law
does
not
require
a
primary.
justice
potter
stewart
has
to
be
done
in
this
way.
is
there
anything
--
forgetting
now
what
the
constitution
might
or
might
not
require,
is
there
anything
in
the
injunction
which
would
prevent
a
group
of
democratic
party
leaders
meeting
and
nominating
the
candidates
for
state
office?
justice
potter
stewart
but
probably
--
well,
that's
about
all
the
republicans
are
in
georgia?
justice
potter
stewart
just
let
me
pursue
my
question
once
more
in
a
different
way.
if
--
if
there
were
--
if
there
were
a
convention,
let's
say
to
which
the
delegates
came
in
kind
of
a
county
unit
way,
for
instance
in
connecticut,
there's
a
convention
of
that
kind,
if
i
understand
it,
i
don't
know
the
detail,
would
that
be
a
state
action?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
say
the
state
law
was
just
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
this
provided
for
--
that
if
a
party
had
gotten
a
certain
percentage
of
the
vote
at
the
last
election
then
they
were
a
party,
but
that
they're
--
but
they
were
entirely
free
to
nominate
their
candidates
any
way
they
wanted
for
the
next
election.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
what
the
classic
said?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
doctrine
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
limited
to
a
one-party
state,
so
to
speak.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
suppose
you
could
conceive
of
a
party
--
of
a
party
that
it
was
political
objective
was,
say,
white
supremacy
and
citizen's
counsel
party
to
say,
it
--
couldn't
it
bar
--
i
mean,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
under
--
we
have
the
right
of
free
political
expression
and
free
speech?
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
giving
a
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
not
here,
i
was
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
(inaudible)
--
you
must
concede
that
a
state
can
classify
as
to
eligibility
of
voters.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
you've
already
asked
the
age
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
length
of
residency?
justice
potter
stewart
without
carrying
that
a
little
further,
could
a
state
classify
an
eligible
voter
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
he
pays
taxes,
state
taxes?
justice
potter
stewart
could
it
classify
on
a
basis
of
whether
he
has
got
at
least
an
eighth
grade
education.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
could
as
to
whether
or
not
he's
literate?
justice
potter
stewart
could
he
do
it
on
how
much
property
he
owns?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
do
not
think
you
get
very
far
calling
one
original
and
something
--
something
else
could
say
--
give
a
man
with
a
graduate
degree,
five
votes,
a
man
with
a
college
--
with
a
ba
degree,
four
votes
and
a
man
with
an
eighth
grade
education,
three
votes?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
be
an
original
classification
as
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
is
the
same
thing
when
you
give
somebody
zero
vote
or
one
vote
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it's
whether
you
get
one
or
two.
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
--
and
you
do
--
and
you
do
as
i
think
you
must
concede
that
a
state
does
have
power
to
classify
certainly
as
to
age
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
length
of
residence?
justice
potter
stewart
and
literacy?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
reading
senator
tower's
new
book
the
other
day
and
it
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
--
perhaps
the
best
democratic
theory
was
to
let
those
who
spend
as
little
--
the
least
money,
have
the
least
vote
--
the
voters
who
spend
the
most
money
have
the
most
vote,
would
that
be
a
--
a
rational
classification?
justice
potter
stewart
would
that
be
original?
justice
potter
stewart
georgia
had
a
poll
tax
from
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
so,
this
--
certainly,
arguably
and
nothing
irrational
and
having
a
reverse
twist
on
economic
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
they
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
state,
i
suppose,
arguably
could
decide
that
we
want
the
have-nots
in
the
state
to
have
more
representation
than
they
have
because
they
are
the
ones
who
need
the
legislative
help?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
know
that
it
has
been
argued
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
how
wide
of
an
impact
would
this
case
have
if
there
--
am
i
right,
in
understanding
from
the
briefs
that
there
are
only
two
other
states
in
the
union
that
have
any
approximation
of
this?
justice
potter
stewart
mississippi.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
--
does
any
state
ever
had
the
--
this
kind
of
system
in
the
general
election
as
distinguished
from
the
primary?
justice
potter
stewart
majority?
justice
potter
stewart
those
were
nominating
petitions,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
seventeenth
amendment
says
senators
shall
be
elected
by
the
people
of
the
state?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
that
can't
mean
literally
what
it
said
with
people
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
a
5-year-old
boy
can
go
up
and
say
i'm
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
nominated
technically
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
yes
sir,
and
if
one
wants
to
argue
the
electoral
college
analogy,
i
am
perfectly
agreeable
to
going
into
it.
but
i
don't
think
it's
apposite
for
the
reason
that
it's
--
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out,
it's
something
that
came
out
of
the
twelfth
amendment
and
this
of
course
predated
the
fourteenth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
the
seventeenth
amendment
argument
necessarily
depends
upon
this
proposition
that
--
this
is
an
election
rather
than
a
nomination.
justice
potter
stewart
does
it
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
is
not
more
than
tantamount
but
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
he
couldn't
take
office
after
that
--
after
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
express
any
position
on
the
seventeenth
amendment
in
your
brief,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
at
least
in
an
election
of
this
kind
of
a
statewide
election
of
executive
or
judicial
officers
with
statewide
constituency.
justice
potter
stewart
you
--
as
i
gather,
you've
implied
there
might
be
different
considerations
and
other
considerations
in
legislative
apportionment
within
a
state?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
not
very
important
one
way
or
the
other?
justice
potter
stewart
the
basic
--
the
basic
issue
that
we
end
up
with
i
suppose
is
whether
a
state
under
the
constitution
in
the
election
process
of
statewide
officials,
statewide
officials
can
absolutely
disregard
the
--
what
we
think
of
is
the
traditional
american
system
of
majority
rule?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
a
majority
rule
is
what
we
come
down
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
a
statewide
election?
