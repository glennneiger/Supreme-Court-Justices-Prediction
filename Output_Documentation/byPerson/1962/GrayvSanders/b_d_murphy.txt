mr.
b.
d.
murphy
yes,
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
by
a
three-judge
district
court
which
held
unconstitutional
georgia's
statute
describing
the
county
unit
system
of
nominating
a
party
of
candidates
for
state
offices
and
enjoining
the
party
of
authorities
against
holding
the
primary
of
1962
or
any
primary
under
a
county
unit
system.
the
history
of
the
county
unit
system
of
georgia
is
set
forth
to
some
extent
in
the
opinion
of
the
court.
the
law
is
also
stated
to
some
extent
in
the
briefs
of
counsel.
it
may
be
worthwhile
for
me
to
state
it
here
as
briefly
as
i
may.
georgia,
of
course,
is
one
of
the
original
13
states.
when
it
became
a
state,
it
consisted
mainly
in
a
few
certain
areas
along
the
atlantic
coast.
i've
forgotten
how
many
counties
we
had
at
that
time.
well,
i
think
it
was
six
or
seven.
the
state
officers
were
elected
by
the
legislature.
the
constitution
assigned
certain
num
--
a
certain
number
of
representatives
to
each
county.
i
think
liberty
county
had
14.
some
of
the
other
counties
had
two,
some
had
four.
the
town
in
port
of
savannah
had
two
that
represent
that
trade.
the
town
in
port
of
sunbury
had
two
to
represent
that
trade.
that
was
the
legislative
body.
as
i
say,
the
legislative
body
elected
the
county
--
the
state
officers.
we
had
no
election
of
governor
by
the
people
until
1823.
early
in
the
history
of
the
state
--
the
political
history
of
the
state,
the
county's
unit
system
of
nominations
developed.
it
started
by
caucuses
in
the
legislature,
members
of
the
legislature
who
belong
to
the
democratic
party
would
get
together
and
nominate
their
candidate
for
governor.
in
the
same
manner,
the
members
of
the
whig
party
and
the
legislature
would
get
together
and
nominate
the
whig
candidate
for
governor.
gradually,
they
began
to
invite
to
those
caucuses
members
of
the
party
from
counties
that
were
represented
in
legislature
by
the
opposite
party.
the
whig
members
would
invite
democrats
from
--
or
invite
whigs
from
counties
who
didn't
have
whig
representatives
and
the
democrats
would
do
the
same
thing.
our
convention
system
of
nomination
grew
out
of
that.
we
never
had
any
direct
primaries
in
georgia
until
about
1890
and
i
think
the
direct
primaries
in
georgia
grew
out
of
the
probably
the
strength
of
what
was
then
known
as
the
populist
party.
the
final
election
of
the
officers
for
the
state
had
been
--
have
always,
since
election
by
the
people
was
inaugurated
about
1823
by
a
majority
vote
of
all
the
voters.
the
legislature
meets
and
canvasses
the
vote
and
declares
the
person
having
the
majority
of
all
the
votes
to
be
the
governor
or
the
state
--
secretary
of
the
state
as
the
case
may
be.
and,
if
nobody
is
elected,
they
have
a
--
the
legislature
proceeds
to
elect
a
governor
from
the
--
either
the
two
or
three
highest.
we
had
a
situation
of
that
sort
in
1946
when
the
governor-elect
died
before
the
time
came
to
inaugurate
and
the
legislature
elected
from
some
write-in
candidates,
and
the
supreme
court
held
they
couldn't
do
that
and
if
the
old
governor
continued
to
hold
office
and
he
hadn't
resigned,
the
lieutenant
governor-elect
was
to
be
the
governor
until
there
could
be
an
election.
that,
of
course,
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
question.
but
i
say,
the
county
unit
system
developed
in
that
way.
finally,
they
began
to
have
direct
primaries
for
the
election.
they
first
began
to
have
primaries
for
the
election
of
delegates
to
the
conventions.
then,
they
began
to
have
--
some
of
the
delegates
were
elected
by
mass
meetings.
your
honors
will
find
a
complete
history
of
the
county
unit
system
in
the
report
of
the
case
of
turman
against
duckworth
in
the
68
f.supp.
744
which
was
the
first
county
unit
lawsuit
we
had.
the
practice
was
entirely
a
party
practice.
there
was
never
any
law
on
the
subject
and
the
convention
was
the
final
nominating
authority
until
the
adoption
of
the
neill
primary
act
of
1917.
prior
to
that
time,
delegates
were,
although
committed
to
the
man
who
--
candidate
who
carried
their
county,
did
not
always
vote
in
a
conformity
without
amendment
and
frequently
there
were
convention
fights.
the
one
which
produced
the
neill
primary
act,
so-called,
was
in
1914
when
there
were
three
candidates
for
the
united
states
senate
and
neither
of
them
had
a
majority
of
the
county
unit
votes.
and,
that
was
a
convention
contest
which
lasted
a
number
of
days
and
was
finally
resulted
in
a
nomination
of
senator
thomas
w.
hardwick
who
was
not
the
leading
candidate
in
the
vote
of
the
people.
the
legislature
passed
the
neill
primary
act
in
1916.
incidentally,
it's
named
for
cecil
neill
who
was
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
representative
of
georgia
at
that
time
and
who
came
from
one
of
the
city
counties,
muscogee.
well,
it
was
vetoed
by
governor
harris,
who
was
then
governor
of
georgia
and
who
also
came
from
one
of
the
city
counties,
bibb.
it
was
reenacted
in
1916
and
near
1917,
and
it
was
then
approved
by
the
new
governor.
the
neill
primary
act
made
no
substantial
change
in
the
nominating
process.
it
does
not
require
primaries.
it
never
has
required
primaries.
it
does
not
abolish
conventions,
but
it
provides
that
whenever
a
dem
--
a
political
party
has
a
primary,
the
person
--
the
candidate
for
any
office
who
carries
--
gets
the
most
votes
in
the
county,
it's
in
plurality
of
votes
and
it's
still
a
plurality
not
a
majority,
is
entitled
to
the
unit
votes
of
that
county
on
the
county
unit
basis
and
that
the
candidate
who
gets
the
majority
of
all
of
the
county
unit
votes
is
entitled
to
the
nomination,
and
that
can
be
ascertained
and
declared
without
a
formal
convention
vote.
incidentally,
in
some
years
when
there's
another
--
it's
not
the
year
the
elected
governor
don't
even
have
a
convention
in
georgia.
the
democratic
party
does.
always
in
the
convention,
the
democratic
party
and
the
democratic
conventions
--
so
far
as
i
know,
the
republican
parties
never
had
one
in
georgia.
always
in
the
democratic
conventions,
each
county
is
entitled
to
two
votes
for
each
member
in
the
lower
house
of
the
general
assembly.
georgia
has,
now,
159
candidates.
it
had
a
137
in
1877
when
the
constitution
of
1877
was
adopted.
the
--
it
has
what
is
called
a
3-2-1
ratio
of
legislative
representation
in
the
house
of
representatives.
the
eight
largest
counties
have
three
representatives.
the
next
30
have
2
and
the
rest
have
1.
as
i
say
always,
in
the
convention
and
in
computing
the
nominating
units
on
the
county
unit
system,
the
counties
have
had
two
votes
--
each
county
has
two
votes
for
each
member
of
the
house
of
representatives
to
which
the
county
is
entitled.
that
is
--
that
was
the
party
practice
before
the
neill
primary
act
was
enacted
and
it
has
been
the
party
practice
and
the
provision
of
the
neill
primary
act
since
that
time.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
it's
not
involved
in
this
case
at
all,
except
that
that
was,
until
an
amendment
of
1962,
the
method
whereby
union
votes
were
allocated
to
the
various
counties.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
this
is
from
the
county
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
--
from
the
representation
of
the
lower
houses
of
the
general
assembly
and
that
had
always
been
the
rule.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
the
apportionment
as
such.
now,
i
say,
in
1877,
we
had
137
counties
in
georgia.
we
may
have
too
many
but
they
all
created
by
the
constitution.
and,
that
constitution
provided
there
should
be
no
more.
in
1903
or
1904,
they
amended
the
constitution.
the
legislature
amended
it
and
proposed
it
to
the
people.
the
people
ratified
it
to
add
--
bring
the
number
of
counties
up
to
145,
and
enough
additional
counties
were
created
to
bring
the
number
of
counties
up
to
145.
it
has
not
always
been
the
eight
highest
with
the
three
representatives
but
that's
the
way
it
is
now
and
was
cite
one
time,
it
was
6,
and
26
in
one.
and,
the
--
since
that
time,
a
number
of
counties
had
been
three
which
brought
the
total,
at
one
time,
up
to
161.
each
one
of
those
counties
was
created
by
separate
constitutional
amendment
proposed
by
the
general
assembly
and
ratified
by
the
people
at
the
general
election.
sometime
ago
--
some
years
ago,
two
of
the
counties
have
been
created
many
years
before
were
merged
with
fulton
county.
those
were
camilla
and
milton,
i
believe.
so,
now,
we
have
159
counties.
the
neill
primary
act,
that
i
said
a
moment
ago,
didn't
changed
the
county
unit
system
as
it
had
been
followed
by
the
party
up
until
that
time.
it
did
provide
that
the
convention
couldn't
change
the
result
of
the
primary
as
respects
to
right
of
a
candidate
who
got
the
most
votes
in
a
particular
county
to
the
vote
of
that
county
on
the
unit
basis
and
provided
that
nobody
was
part
of
the
majority
of
the
county
unit
votes
for
governor
or
united
states
senate,
that
should
be
a
run-over
primary
between
the
two
highest
candidates
for
those
two
officers
alone.
and
all
the
other
state
officers,
the
candidate
with
the
most
county
unit
votes,
the
plurality
county
votes
was
to
be
the
nominee.
the
can
--
the
neill
primary
act
does
not
apply
to
the
congressional
district
primaries.
it
leaves
to
the
determination
of
the
congressional
committee
or
to
the
executive
committee
of
the
party
in
the
district,
whether
or
not
it
will
have
a
primary
on
a
popular
vote
basis
or
on
a
county
unit
basis.
but,
if
it
is
held
on
a
county
unit
basis,
then
the
unit
votes
to
which
the
county
--
which
each
county
would
be
the
entitled
would
be
the
same
as
fixed
in
the
neill
primary
act,
that
is
two
for
each
representative
in
the
lower
house
in
the
general
assembly.
in
1946,
the
first
suit
challenging
the
validity
of
the
georgia
county
unit
system
was
filed
in
a
three-judge
court
in
the
northern
district
of
georgia.
that
was
filed
by
mr.
--
mrs.
turman
against
the
chairman
of
the
state
democratic
executive
committee.
there
was
a
companion
case
filed
by
cook,
a
man
named
cook,
against
the
secretary
of
state
which
related
to
the
fifth
congressional
district
of
georgia.
it
so
happen
that
in
1946,
the
governor
of
the
c
--
the
democratic
candidate
for
governor
who
received
the
highest
number
of
unit
--
the
majority
of
unit
votes
did
not
receive
the
highest
number
of
popular
votes.
he
didn't
--
there
were
two
candidates
and
the
man
who
got
the
highest
number
of
unit
--
majority
of
unit
votes
was
the
second
in
popular
vote.
and,
that
brought
about
the
case
of
turman
against
duckworth.
that
was
heard
before
a
three-judge
court
and
the
three-judge
court
have
decided
against
the
plaintiffs
there
and
it
was
appealed
to
this
court.
the
appeal
here
was
dismissed.
i
don't
want
to
take
to
go
into
whether
or
not
this
court
dismissed
the
appeal
because
they
were
moot
or
for
any
other
reason.
the
record
shows
what
happened.
that
was
shortly
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
colegrove
versus
green
from
illinois.
in
1915,
there
was
another
suit
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
by
a
mr.
south
and
his
associate
whose
name
i've
forgotten.
that
was
the
case
of
south
versus
peters,
mr.
peters
being
then
challenged
in
the
state
democratic
executive
committee.
that
was
tried
before
a
three-judge
court
composed
of
judge
sibley,
judge
andrews,
and
judge
hope.
and,
i
say
judge
hope
or
judge
sibley
because
he
was
then
the
senior
judge,
i
think,
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and,
we
think
in
georgia,
a
very
able
judge.
judge
sibley
wrote
a
very
strong
opinion
upholding
the
county
unit
system
and
it's
set
forth
in
the
case
--
in
that
case
in
the
89
f.supp.,
at
672.
i
will
not
undertake
to
read
it,
but
he
goes
into
the
history
of
the
county
unit
system
again,
as
he
had
done
earlier
in
turman
versus
duckworth.
that
case
was
also
appealed
to
this
court
and
it
was,
here,
as
i
read
the
decision
of
this
court,
affirmed.
in
the
meantime,
macdougall
versus
green
had
been
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
your
honor,
i
thought
that
the
--
i'll
be
glad
to
look
at
it
and
refresh
my
recollection,
but
i
thought
that
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
was
affirmed
by
this
court.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
well,
it
may
have
been.
if
so,
it
may
be
that
the
late
--
the
last
case,
baker
versus
carr,
answers
those
questions.
now,
the
next
case
that
we
had
was
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
that
was
the
case
of
cox
versus
peters.
that
case
was
dismissed
on
demurrer
by
the
trial
judge
in
the
superior
court
of
meriwether
county,
and
that
dismissal
was
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
that
appeal
was
dismissed
in
this
court
for
warrant
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
the
next
attack
on
the
county
unit
system
was
a
suit
brought
in
the
united
states
court
for
the
northern
district
of
georgia
by
mayor
hartsfield
of
atlanta
against
the
chairman
of
the
democratic
executive
committee
and
others
which
the
trial
judge
dismissed
and
refused
him
to
empanel
a
three-judge
court.
and
this
court
did
not
allow
an
appeal
from
that
decision.
so,
the
justice
thought
that
a
rule
to
show
cause
should
be
issued,
but
it
was
not
issued
and
that
appeal
was
not
granted.
now,
that
ended
the
litigation
about
the
georgia
county
unit
system
until
the
decision
of
this
court
in
baker
versus
carr.
we
had
a
new
suit
in
the
northern
district
of
georgia
which
was
heard
by
a
three-judge
court
and
that's
the
case
we
have
here.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
yes.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
none
of
them
was
an
attack
on
the
legislative
apportionment.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
they
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
that's
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think,
the
petition
in
this
case
was
copied
almost
verbatim
from
south
versus
peters.
it
was
filed
on
the
same
day
of
the
decision
in
baker
versus
carr.
i
will
say
that
in
south
versus
peters,
the
election
involved
there
--
the
election
in
1950,
i
think
it
was
1950,
also
involved
the
election
for
the
nomination
of
the
united
states
senate.
now,
this
case
was
filed
and
immediately
after
baker
against
carr.
i
don't
think
it's
improper
to
say.
that
was,
of
course,
a
great
deal
of
conversation
among
georgians,
georgia
politicians
about
the
effect
of
that
decision
and
there
were
numerous
conferences
on
the
subject,
and
the
legislature
was
called
into
extraordinary
session.
it
was
actually
an
extraordinary
session
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
in
the
court
below
in
this
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
passed
and
the
governor
approved
on
--
the
judgment
in
this
case
was
--
or
the
hearing
was
concluded.
i'm
not
sure
whether
judgment
was
entered
on
that
day
or
the
next
day.
the
governor
approved
a
statute
which
amended
the
neill
primary
act
and
these
respects,
i
said
a
little
while
ago
we
have
159
counties
in
georgia,
and
the
new
act
allocated
unit
votes
to
the
various
counties
in
accordance
with
the
bracket
system
that's
set
forth
in
the
act
and
is
in
the,
i
think,
in
the
briefs
and
is
also
in
the
opinion
of
the
court.
no
longer
was
the
number
of
votes
of
the
county
--
number
of
unit
votes
to
which
the
county
was
entitled
based
twice
than
the
number
of
the
representatives
in
the
lower
house
to
give
us
in.
the
act
provides,
new
armies
will
have
it,
that
all
counties
with
the
population
of
less
than
15,000
shall
have
2
unit
votes.
counties
with
a
population
between
15
and
20
or
25,
i'm
not
sure
which,
will
have
3
and
so
on.
finally,
it
gets
up
to
a
bracket
where
they
allocate
additional
votes
at
the
rate
of
2
for
each
15,000
additional
population.
under
the
county
unit
system,
as
it
was
enacted
by
that
statute,
fulton
county
which
had
6
unit
votes
under
the
old
system
and
now
has
40.
no
county
has
less
than
two,
however
small
the
population
may
be.
the
court
of
--
the
three-judge
court
held
that
this
new
--
that
the
neill
primary
act,
as
amended
by
the
act
of
1962,
was
unconstitutional
because
it
was
invidiously
discriminatory
against
people
who
lived
in
--
against
the
plaintiff
and
others
similarly
situated,
if
they
have
been
a
resident
of
fulton
county.
i
overlook,
saying
that
the
new
act
provides
that,
in
order
to
be
nominated
in
the
first
primary,
the
candidate
must
receive
not
only
a
majority
of
the
county
unit
votes
but
a
majority
of
the
popular
votes.
and,
if
he
does
not
receive
a
majority
of
the
county
unit
votes
and
no
county
receives
a
majority
of
the
county
unit
votes
and
a
majority
of
the
popular
votes,
there's
a
run-over
primary
between
the
candidate
receiving
the
greatest
number
of
county
unit
votes
and
the
candidate
receiving
the
greatest
number
of
popular
votes.
unless,
it
so
happens
that
the
candidate
will
receive
the
greatest
number
of
county
unit
votes,
also
received
the
greatest
number
of
popular
votes,
but
not
a
majority
of
either
or
both.
then,
it
run-off
is
between
the
candidate
with
the
highest
number
of
county
unit
votes
and
the
candidate
with
the
highest
number
of
popular
votes
but,
in
that
run-off
primary,
the
candidate
who
receives
the
majority
of
the
most
county
unit
votes,
without
being
a
majority
because
there'd
be
only
two,
is
declared
the
nominee.
there
was
this
additional
change
in
the
nominating
process
that,
as
respects,
officers
--
candidates
for
officers,
other
than
governor
and
united
states
senate,
the
same
rule
applies
of
requiring
the
majority,
both
the
county
unit
vote
and
the
popular
vote.
and,
if
there
is
no
majority
of
both,
then
the
two
highest
candidates
would
have
to
run
again.
now
the
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
the
one
who
gets
the
highest
unit
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
of
course
he
has
to
have
a
majority
because
there's
going
to
be
two.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
majority
of
the
units.
he's
entitled
to
nomination.
i
say
it
makes
that
change
in
the
nominating
process,
as
embodied
in
the
neill
primary
act.
the
neill
primary
act
requires
only
plurality
of
county
unit
votes
of
candidates
other
than
the
governor
and
united
states
senate.
whereas,
this
act,
as
i
read
it,
requires
the
same
sort
of
majority
for
all
the
candidates
than
it
does
for
governor
and
united
states
senate.
now,
the
court
in
this
case
said
that
this
act
was
invidiously
discriminatory
and
it
set
forth
its
definition
of
invidious
discrimination
in
the
opinion
and
enjoined
the
secretary
of
state,
who
was
the
state
official
who
handles
elections
and
putting
in
the
voter's
name
on
the
ballot
with
the
general
election
who
is
nominated
under
the
act
or
by
virtue
of
the
county
unit
system.
now,
enjoined
the
party
authorities
from
holding
any
primary
in
1962
or
any
other
time.
under
any
county
unit
system,
unless
it
was
such
a
county
unit
system
as
it
would
not
be
invidiously
discriminatory
under
the
opinion
that
was
filed
by
the
court
in
this
case.
as
i
read
that
opinion,
it
provides
that
the
county
unit
system
will
not
be
invidiously
discriminatory
if
it
allocates
unit
votes
to
counties
on
a
basis
of
population
or
if
it
allocates
unit
votes
on
the
basis
of
–
on
the
law
of
equal
proportion
that
relates
to
the
assignment
of
the
representatives
in
congress
and
will
not
be
discriminatory
if
--
but
it
provides
that
no
discrimination
will
be
deemed
invidious
if
there's
no
greater
discrimination
against
any
county
than
there
is
against
the
laws
--
against
any
state
in
the
assignment
of
electoral
votes
at
the
last
election
for
president
and
vice-president
of
the
united
states.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
where
that
theory
would
lead
georgia
with
reference
to
the
assignment
of
county
unit
votes.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
well,
if
you
--
if
this
court
holds
that
the
neill
primary
act
is
unconstitutional
for
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
no,
sir.
it's
not
all
that's
before
here.
there's
also
before
you
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
democratic
party
in
georgia,
without
any
state
law.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
they
can
hold
a
primary
on
a
county
unit
basis.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
no,
sir.
there's
been
--
none
has
been
adopted.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
this
case
was
handed
down,
the
state
democratic
executive
committee
met
and
revised
its
rule
so
as
to
provide
for
a
popular
vote
and
the
primary
then
was
held
in
september
1962.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
no
stay
was
requested
in
this
court.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
but
there
was
denied
in
the
court
below,
and
i
don't
--
now,
as
i
say,
if
the
court
holds
that
the
neill
primary
act,
as
amended,
is
unconstitutional,
as
did
the
trial
court,
then
the
next
question
is
what
can
the
democratic
party
in
georgia
do
about
it?
under
this
decree,
it
can
hold
a
democratic
primary
on
a
county
unit
basis,
to
hold
it
only
on
a
popular
vote
basis,
although
it
may
if
the
court
permits
this
formula
that
was
set
forth
by
–
for
the
court
below
to
stand.
it
may
hold
the
primary
on
the
county
unit
basis,
provided
it
meets
the
requirements
of
the
court's
idea
about
what
will
not
be
invidious
discrimination.
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
appellants
here
as
stated
in
our
brief
and
is
--
i
think
we
stand
upon
that
the
county
unit
system,
as
it
existed
in
georgia
at
the
time
of
the
amendment
of
the
act
of
19
--
the
mandatory
act
of
1962
and,
as
it
now
exists,
is
that
and
represents
a
proper
exercise
of
legislative
power
by
the
state.
of
course
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
no,
sir.
it
struck
down
the
act
we
had.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
and
said
you
could
have
one
if
you
--
the
party
could
hold
--
of
course
the
party
--
the
act,
being
unconstitutional,
is
left
to
the
party
but
the
party
did
not
know
and
take
the
word
out.
the
--
a
system
that
would
be
in
conformity
with
the
court's
opinion,
the
party
simply
reverted
to
the
majority
vote
and
the
last
election
was
held
on
majority
vote
basis.
now,
we
needed
to
have
a
reapportionment
here.
so,
that's
not
on
its
way
up
here
because
we
had
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
never
have
granted
appeal
to
judgment
and
express
this
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
i
think
that
baker
versus
carr
answers
that
question
that
this
court
can
deal
with
what
i'm
trying
to
say
here
that,
where
the
act
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
sir?
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
this
is
a
primary,
yes.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
it's
a
party
primary,
yes.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
no,
sir.
we
raise
no
question
about
it
being
state
action.
i
think
we
have
passed
all
that
questions.
i
think
this
court
is
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
it
would
be
moot
if
it
related
only
to
the
1962
election,
but
the
judgment
of
injunction
is
broad
and
sweeping.
it's
enjoined
this
forever
against
holding
a
primary
under
county
unit
basis
under
the
county
unit
system
unless
we
do
it
according
to
what
the
court
says
would
not
be
invidiously
discriminatory.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
why
it
is
a
state
action?
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
well,
i
think
it
is
--
we
would
contend
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
that's
correct.
i
think,
under
the
decision
of
this
court,
this
court
will
hold
this
at
state
action,
and
i
don't
mean
to
say
by
that
but
i
agree
with
it
but
i
say
my
point
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
--
in
trying
to
flog
the
dead
horse
on
that
question.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
terry
against
adams
and
these
other
cases,
the
classic
case.
i
wouldn't
say
that
--
the
law
of
georgia
doesn't
require
primary.
it
doesn't
require
primary
for
any
purpose
and
the
neill
primary
act,
as
it
existed
before
the
court
struck
it
down
as
unconstitutional,
unless
we
can
get
to
this
court
to
reverse
it,
doesn't
require
a
primary.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
that's
the
contention
on
the
other
side
and
i
think
that's
what
this
court
decided
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
well,
that
exact
question
was
that
where
judge
sibley
in
--
the
only
time
is
have
been
considered,
i
think
authoritatively,
was
by
judge
sibley
in
south
against
peters
and
he
said
it
was
not
equivalent
to
election.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
that
it
was
not
equivalent
to
election,
the
democratic
nomination.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
yes.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
well,
in
the
jayberg,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
might
review
that
situation
again
in
view
of
the
fact
that
there
is
an
elected
republican
senator
in
georgia
and
we've
got
a
republican
senator
in
the
state
senate
who
was
elected
in
november.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
to
the
county
unit
system?
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
well,
we
think
that
the
county
--
the
democratic
party
of
georgia
would
have
a
right
to
adopt
any
method
of
nominating
its
candidates
if
it
sees
prompt.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
how
is
that?
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
yes
sir.
i
have
no
idea
as
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
state
democratic
executive
committee
and
i
don't
know
how
or
what
the
next
committee
will
do.
i
will
say
this,
the
only
time
that
the
dominant
political
factor
in
georgia
heretofore
has
changed
from
the
county
unit
system
was
1908,
i
believe,
when
governor
hoke
smith
who,
by
which
of
being
a
governor
was
well
dominating
the
executive
committee,
reverted
to
the
popular
vote
plan
and
abandoned
the
county
unit
system
and
he
was
very
silently
defeated
for
that
reason,
and
since
then,
they've
been
back
on
the
county
unit
basis.
now
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
well,
i
don't
think
you
would
and
i
think
if
the
democratic
party
want
to
have
a
state
convention
to
nominate
its
candidates,
it
ought
to
be
allowed
to
do
so
and
i
think
it
could
do
so,
most
of
the
other
states
could.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
i
think,
probably,
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
the
outstanding
injunction
enjoining
them
against
holding
any
primary.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
it
just
relates
to
primary.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
well,
that's
what
the
republicans
do
in
georgia.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
i
think
--
i
didn't
mean
to
be
facetious,
your
honor.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
well,
your
honor,
they
nominate
the
candidate
for
governor.
i
mean,
it's
in
this
record.
i
suppose
the
only
man
who
knew
about
it
was
judge
tuttle
who
happens
to
be
a
republican,
and
he
set
out
in
this
record
in
outlining
the
history
of
the
georgia
politics
and
the
georgia
county
unit
system
how
it
is
that
--
in
the
opinion
of
the
court,
how
it
is
that
they
nominate
candidates,
the
republicans
nominate
candidates.
and,
they
have
a
county
unit
system.
it's
sort
of
like
ours.
but,
he
says
that
the
republican
party
of
georgia,
although
judiciary
it
is
probably
not
action
normally
anyone
from
the
statewide
office
during
this
century,
uses
a
convention
system
for
nominating
for
state
office
and
presidential
election
here.
the
convention
also
selects
a
state
central
committee
which
has
the
power
to
nominate
candidates
between
quadrants
of
conventions
which
are
held
during
presidential
election
here
and
its
elect
meets
the
county
at
mass
meetings
to
the
state
and
the
primary
toll
in
georgia.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
know
how
well
it
had
to
find
election
is
to
do
it
that
way
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
a
violation
of
this
injunction.
i
started
to
say
that
the
republican
quite
operates
that
way
in
georgia
and
did
nominate
a
candidate
for
governor
in
1962
and
he
qualified
by
getting
a
requisite
number
of
signatures
on
his
nominative
petition.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
well,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
georgia
where
a
republican
or
any
other
party
has
not
elected
a
candidate
for
state
office
since
i
have
been
old
enough
to
vote.
i,
again,
remember
back
to
reconstruction
but
the
only
reason
that
the
democratic
party
elects
the
state
officer
--
of
course,
that's
the
way
the
people
vote
in
the
final
election
in
november
and
he
has
to
get
a
majority
of
all
the
votes
cast.
ordinarily,
he
doesn't
have
any
opposition.
i
agree
that
that's
true,
but
the
only
reason
why
that
is
so
is
because
that's
the
way
the
people
vote
and,
this
year,
there
would've
been
a
republican
candidate
who
would've
polled
a
very
substantial
vote.
the
republican
party
got
about
35
--
between
35%
and
40%
of
the
votes
in
1960
for
in
the
presidential
election.
and,
mr.
--
the
candidate,
unfortunately,
was
killed
in
an
automobile
accident
and
didn't
get
to
make
the
race,
but
they
did
nominate
a
very
fine
--
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
no,
sir.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
no,
sir,
we
have
not.
we
have
not.
mr.
b.
d.
murphy
yes,
sir,
and
we
are
not
undertaking
to
reargue
those
questions,
that
is
this
difference,
i
think,
in
classic
case
and
in
the
allwright
case
that,
in
those
cases,
the
primary
was
required
by
the
law
in
the
county
in
georgia.
