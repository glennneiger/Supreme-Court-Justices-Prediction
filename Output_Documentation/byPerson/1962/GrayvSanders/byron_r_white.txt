justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
murphy,
you
don't
--
do
you
contend
that
the
--
that,
without
there
being
a
state
act
which
had
been
set
aside,
you
say
the
party
did
something
or
you
--
is
there
any
part
of
your
argument
that
the
state
action
would
--
would
--
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
think
that
the
record
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
primary.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
primary.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
primary
and
it's
a
party
primary.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
--
you
raise
no
question
about
it
being
a
state
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
any
question
about
the
case
being
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
tell
me
how
the
--
why
this
is
state
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
let's
assume
there
was
no
statute
whatsoever
stated
in
your
argument
relating
county
unit,
but
there's
the
party
rule
only.
justice
byron
r.
white
after
all,
the
party
was
the
one
who
decided
to
hold
a
popular
--
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
decisions
are
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
then
if
the
primary
is
state
action,
so
is
the
convention.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
would
you
say
that
if
the
party
decided
to
nominate
by
a
convention,
that
--
and
that
the
convention
was
organized
on
the
same
basis
as
the
--
on
the
county
unit
basis,
that
we
have
a
state
action
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
leverett,
you
are
suggesting
then
that
--
that
if
the
--
if
the
legislative
question
were
here
along
with
the
county
unit
question,
the
apportionment
of
the
state
legislature
and
the
measure
was
the
same
in
each
case
that
you
should
get
the
same
answer
here
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
must
be
the
--
that
must
be
the
result
of
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
making
the
contrary
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
you
to
say
that
there's
enough
reason
for
the
legislature
to
simply
to
want
to
prefer
beyond
the
less
populous
counties
and
that's
the
end
of
the
question.
did
you
simply
want
to
--
the
legislature
simply
wants
to
weight
the
less
populous
county's
votes?
in
the
primary
they
should
be
perfectly
free
to
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
--
and
that's
enough
ration
--
that's
enough
rationality.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
--
and
you
would
get
the
same
answer
then
i
suppose
if
they
did
it
another
way
and
said
each
person
in
a
rural
area,
you're
in
a
certain
county
gets
three
votes,
he
casts
three
ballots.
you
get
exactly
the
same
results,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
whatever
the
figures
would
be
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
said,
he
would
cast
out
many
more
votes,
he
would've
--
you
should
come
out
with
a
--
in
the
legislature
spree
to
--
to
give
people
an
equal
voting
power.
that's
--
that's
essentially
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
care
about
the
figure
--
i
don't
care
about
the
figures.
i
just
--
but
wouldn't
you
get
the
same
answer
also
if
the
legislature
changed
its
mind
next
year
and
said
that
we
will
give
people
in
the
city
four
votes
and
people
in
the
country
one
vote?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
let's
assume
that
you
had
--
that
they've
just
reversed
the
scales
and
made
the
county
unit
system
preferential
to
urban
areas
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
rather
than
rural
areas.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
history
hasn't
anything
to
do
with
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
then
you
wouldn't
--
you
suggest
you
wouldn't
get
the
same
result
that
you
weighted
this
system
in
favor
of
the
cities
because
that
isn't
historical.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
have
a
suggestion
as
to
why
you
say
it's
irrelevant,
i
know
that,
but
assume
someone
didn't
agree
with
you.
do
you
have
some
suggestions
as
to
why
the
rural
area
geographically
should
be
preferred
in
the
--
in
the
amount
of
voting
power
it
has
in
the
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
diffusion
doesn't
mean
inequality,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
diffusion
doesn't
mean
inequality.
you
had
com
--
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you
had
absolute
diffusion
when
you
had
a
--
when
you
had
a
--
your
life
primary.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
--
that
was
diffusion
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
you
would
i
suppose
get
the
same
result
then
when
the
legislature
decided
to
weight
the
votes
in
favor
of
functional
groups.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
abram,
as
i
--
you
didn't
cross
petition
here,
did
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
didn't
cross
petition
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
here
and
--
so,
you're
perfectly
happy
with
the
discriminations
that
are
built
into
the
--
and
allowed
by
the
decree
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
doesn't
be
really
the
decree
below
to
the
extent
that
it
does
allow
a
discriminatory
system?
doesn't
it
really
violate
some
of
the
things
you
have
been
arguing
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
state
as
i
understand
in
your
brief
suggest
that
the
--
that
--
and
the
government
suggests
that
some
part
of
the
decree
be
eliminated
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
part
of
the
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
what
do
you
think
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
mr.
attorney
general
--
excuse
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
now,
why
is
it
--
mr.
general,
why
is
it
so
clear
that
the
(inaudible)
--
this
particular
system
is
so
bad?
is
it
(inaudible)
--
the
government's
position
that
there
is
no
scheme
at
all
in
this
system
that
isn't
a
crazy
quilt
without
any
reason
or
is
it
that
it's
so
clear
and
so
--
is
there
so
much
of
a
pattern
of
discrimination
against
urban
areas?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
more
--
the
more
rural
an
area
is,
the
more
weighted
votes
gets.
that's
the
whole
spectrum
of
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
its
--
do
you
say
the
government's
position
is
that
beyond
the
power
of
the
legislature
of
georgia
to
prefer
a
rural
voter
to
an
urban
voter?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
the
real
--
really
meaningful
figures
is
not
to
be
the
population
of
the
counties,
the
numbers
of
democrats
or
republicans
in
the
primary.
they
really
got
a
weight.
(inaudible)
strength
of
the
counties,
you
ought
to
do
it
over
the
number
of
people
voting
in
that
primary,
shouldn't
you,
rather
than
the
population.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
isn't
that
--
isn't
that
a
significant
factor
in
some
counties
of
georgia
or
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
number
of
republican
voters
in
georgia
is
not
large
enough
to
make
this
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
in
any
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
apportionment
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
now
what
did
--
what
was
that
point,
i
didn't
(inaudible).
