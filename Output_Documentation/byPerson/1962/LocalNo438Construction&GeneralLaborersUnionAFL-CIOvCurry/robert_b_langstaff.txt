mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
r.
b.
langstaff
from
albany,
georgia
appearing
for
the
respondent.
i
might
add
that
i
have
shepherded
this
case
from
its
very
inception
in
fulton
superior
court
in
atlanta,
georgia.
and
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
i'd
like
to
clarify
if
i
might
sir,
inception
to
my
argument
the
fact
that
no
formal
restraining
order
has
ever
been
issued
in
this
case
in
fulton
superior
court.
the
order
in
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well
your
honor,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
actually
the
question
is
rather
moot.
the
picket
line
was
withdraw
prior
to
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
when
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
handed
down
its
decision,
the
remittitur
was
entered
on
the
docket
of
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county
which
counsel
had
read
to
you,
but
there
was
never
an
injunction
issued
from
that
court.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i'll
be
--
eminently
disagree
your
honor.
as
i
understand
the
local
practice,
counsel
must
go
in
after
the
remittitur
had
returned
and
asked
that
an
injunction
be
issued
pursuant
to
the
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir.
if
the
picket
line
had
been
there
--
but
we
have
never
taken
such
an
order
because
the
picket
line
was
voluntarily
removed.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
of
course
the
remittitur
is
entered
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
then
the
trial
court
is
authorized
to
issue
the
order
based
on
the
remittitur.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
it
is
my
understanding
that
our
practice
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir.
i
think
maybe
i
can
best
answer
that
question
by
referring
the
court
to
page
41
of
the
record
which
is
the
order
denying
the
interlocutory
injunction
at
the
original
trial
court
hearing
on
september
the
12th,
1961,
which
the
honorable
[inaudible]
page
4
entered
the
following
order.
this
cause
came
on
this
day
to
be
heard
upon
the
pleadings
in
the
case,
affidavits,
all
testimony,
and
argument
of
counsel
from
all
of
which
it
appeared
that
the
applications
for
temporary
interlocutory
injunction
should
be
denied
and
is
so
denied.
it
is
from
this
order
that
we
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
this
--
it
is
this
order
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
reversed
sending
its
remittitur
back
to
the
trial
court
which
was
duly
entered
on
the
records.
the
remittitur
is
not
a
part
of
the
record
your
honor.
however,
if
the
counsel
readily
concede
that
such
a
remittitur
has
been
issued
and
if
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
been
placed
on
the
minutes
of
the
trial
docket
or
rather
on
the
minutes
of
the
court
of
fulton
superior
court.
however,
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
never
requested
that
a
formal
restraining
order
issue
pursuant
to
that
remittitur.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
it
is
not
contained
in
the
record.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i
don't
believe
you
have
it
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i'd
be
glad
the
counsel
submitted
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
counsel
read
it
to
the
court,
your
honor.
i
have
never
examined
the
minutes
myself
of
the
trial
court
of
atlanta,
but
i
assume
that
this
is
remittitur,
the
reports
to
be
done.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
the
counsel
for
petitioner
tells
me
this
purports
to
be
the
remittitur.
the
honorable
supreme
court
met
pursuant
to
adjournment
the
following
judgment
was
rendered.
this
is
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
and
not
a
remittitur.
well,
s.
j.
curry
company
et
al.
versus
construction
and
general
laborers'
union,
local
number
438,
afl-cio,
this
case
came
before
this
court
upon
a
writ
of
error
from
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county.
and
after
argument,
it
is
considered
and
adjudged
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
reversed
because
the
court
erred
in
refusing
the
interlocutory
injunction,
all
the
justices
concurred.
upon
considering
that
within
the
remittitur,
it
is
ordered
and
adjudged
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
in
georgia
be
made
the
judgment
of
this
court
and
the
same
being
entered
on
the
minutes.
it
is
further
ordered
and
adjudged
that
s.
j.
curry
et
al.
for
use
of
officers
in
the
court
recover
of
construction
and
general
laborers'
union,
number
438,
afl-cio
including
the
cost
of
making
up
the
record
in
said
case
together
with
a
cost
--
dues
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
the
said
case.
in
open
court,
this
29th
day
of
january,
1962,
to
our
page
4.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i
might
i
add
your
honor,
this
is
done
by
the
judge
without
any
intervention
of
counsel.
it's
[inaudible]
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
that's
all.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
this
is
not
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
and
that
has
never
been
a
restraining
order
issue
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
mostly
eminently
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
we'll
be
glad
to
supplement
a
brief
later
to
the
court
if
the
court
so
desire.
but
it
is
my
understanding
of
our
practice
that
counsel
must
request
the
issue
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
it
did
not,
except
to
reverse
the
trial
court
that
held
that
judgment
was
an
error
based
on
the
record.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
there
would
have
been
until
we
had
issued
an
injunction
pursuant
to
the
remittitur.
i
do
not
deny
that
we
would
have
asked
for
such
an
injunction
to
be
issued
if
the
picket
line
that
had
been
restored.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
that
is
correct,
sir.
and
i
think
the
record
so
disclose
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
that's
correct,
sir,
one
of
the
reasons.
i,
if
the
court
will
permit
to
transverse
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
there
is
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
oh,
no,
sir.
i
do
not
mean
to
reply.
this
is
a
technique
for
circumventing
this
question
of
finality
at
all.
but
in
this
particular
case
which
after
all
we're
limited
to
in
the
fights.
the
picket
line
was
gone.
there
was
nothing
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
i'm
not
arguing
that,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir,
i
am
not.
if
the
court
will
permit
me
to
digress
for
a
moment,
as
i
view
this
case
and
as
it
is
before
this
court
on
the
limited
writ
of
certiorari,
i
think
there
are
three
personal
case
--
questions
before
the
court.
of
course,
the
first
one
being
the
finality
of
decree,
the
second
were
dealing
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
or
the
trial
court
of
georgia
or
in
other
words,
the
question
of
preemption.
and
further,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
decree
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
is
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
record
that
was
before
that
court.
now
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
treat
these
matters
in
the
order
they
are
–-
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
there
is
not
an
injunction.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
there
has
never
been
an
injunction.
there
has
never
been.
and
perhaps
it
would
be
well
if
i
reviewed
for
the
court
the
facts
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
sir?
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir,
that
is.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir.
it
would
have
to
be
in
line
with
our
petition
with
the
prayers
on
our
petition.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
that
is
correct.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
i
don't
believe
that
the
final
order
would
have
been
in
that
language.
i
think
the
final
order
would
have
simply
been
that
the
trial
court
would've
issued
an
order
upon
our
request
that
the
defendant
be
restrained
from
conduct
alleged
in
the
petition
pursuant
to
the
prayers
of
our
petition.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
because
there
was
no
necessity
for
it,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
picket
line
had
been
removed
long
before
--
actually
even
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court,
that
it's
been
voluntary.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
well,
this
is
not
true
on
our
practice.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
is
the
office
of
the
remittitur.
when
the
remittitur
comes
down
to
the
trial
court
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
impressed
on
the
minutes
of
the
trial
court
and
thereafter
of
course,
the
case
stands
as
the
supreme
court
said
it
did
that
the
interlocutory
order
would
--
should
have
been
granted
but
no
such
a
question
was
ever
made
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well
sir,
of
course,
this
would've
been
discretionary
with
the
trial
judge
but
in
the
cases
that
i
have
had
many
experiences
about
--
had
this
would've
been
about
the
substance
of
the
order.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
i
would
say
on
all
honesty
and
in
fairness
to
judge
randolph
who
was
very
a
capable
judge,
that
his
final
order
would
have
probably
used
the
language
in
the
petition
to
the
extent
that
he
was
--
that
he
would
make
it
clear
what
the
conduct
he
was
enjoining.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
that's
--
i
would
have
to
state
that
that
is
so
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i
cannot
agree,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
until
the
court
issued
a
formal
order,
until
the
trial
court
issues
an
order
restraining
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
there
is
no
legal
barrier
against
the
petitioner's
conduct.
the
picket
line
could
have
been
reestablished
without
any
ramifications
until
we
saw
that
--
that
they
saw
it
--
too
it
rather
that
the
trial
court
enforced
the
remittitur.
this
is
the
practice
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
--
and
divorce
the
proceeding
that
the
practice
in
any
appellate
review
when
the
case
is
returned
to
the
trial
court.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
oh,
yes,
sir.
it
surely
can't.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
but
it
did
not.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
oh,
no,
sir.
no,
i
do
not
mean
that.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir.
there
is
no
question
of
what
the
trial
court
was
bound
by
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
insofar
as
it
related
to
the
decree
on
merits.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
this
is
an
interesting
question,
mr.
justice
black,
and
i'm
apologizing
to
the
court
that
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
what
would
happen
if
the
man
was
in
contempt
of
this
order
before
a
formal
order
was
issued
by
the
trial
court.
i
would
be
inclined
to
agree
that
the
--
the
remittitur
would
be
--
this
form
and
force
of
an
order,
i
think
that
the
contempt
would
lie
but
i
can't
answer
this
question
in
the
affirmative.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
your
honor,
this
is
one
thing
that
mystifies
me
about
this
case
as
i
was
about
to
argue.
the
legal
effect
of
the
order,
it
seems
to
me
this
court
is
being
asked
to
review
and
notwithstanding
what
i
thought
was
going
to
be
a
week
from
the
montgomery
case,
it
appears
to
me
that
the
argument
here
has
made
the
montgomery
case
even
sounder
than
it
appears
on
its
own
facts.
what
has
appeared
here
and
what
this
case
is
--
what
this
court
is
being
asked
to
review
is
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
on
an
interlocutory
order
from
the
trial
court
of
fulton
county,
georgia.
and
with
the
court's
confirmation
and
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
let
me
review
the
facts
just
very
briefly.
this
petition
was
filed
in
fulton
superior
court
and
thereafter
under
our
procedure,
an
ex
parte
order
was
issued
directing
the
parties
to
appear
for
the
interlocutory
order.
the
ex
parte
order
denied
the
request
for
injunction
and
the
matter
was
set
out
down
10
or
15
days
after
that
for
interlocutory
hearing.
at
the
interlocutory
hearing,
the
petition
only,
the
sworn
petition
and
the
affidavits
of
the
respondent
here
that
the
plaintiff
below,
when
the
county
affidavits
from
the
defendants
were
presented
to
a
trial
judge
without
a
jury.
the
matter
was
heard
and
fully
heard
by
the
trial
judge
and
he
issued
the
order,
i
read
it
to
the
court
a
moment
ago.
he
denied
the
interlocutory
order.
thereupon
the
respondent
here,
appealed
this
matter
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
as
we
can
do
under
our
practice
since
otherwise,
we
would
be
left
to
the
same
mercy
of
interlocutory
order
of
the
petition
announced
that
he
is
from
our
supreme
court.
we
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
the
court
of
course
is
familiar
with
their
decision.
now
in
the
interim,
the
petitioner
has
filed,
the
other
defensive
pleadings
which
raised
the
very
same
questions
that
it's
now
asking
this
court
to
review
before
the
matter
has
been
completed
under
the
practice
--
under
the
practice
of
the
state
of
georgia.
for
instance,
the
petitioner
has
filed
a
plea
in
abatement
which
is
the
method
that
we
used
in
the
state
practice
in
georgia
in
attacking
questions
of
jurisdiction.
the
constitutional
question
involving
a
preemption
of
the
section
7
and
8
of
the
national
act,
the
plea
in
abatement
remains
un-disposed
off
in
the
trial
court.
it's
on
the
motion
docket
and
maybe
called
at
anytime
by
the
petitioner
for
any.
and
if
the
trial
judge
should
rule
that
the
plea
is
good
then
the
case
goes
out.
of
course,
the
fact
remains
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
decided
the
question
on
the
merits
as
presented.
but
the
question
of
jurisdiction
has
never
been
submitted
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
other
than
on
argument
of
counsel.
the
question
of
jurisdiction
was
not
even
in
attained
in
the
trial
court
because
it
was
not
properly
raised
under
the
pleading.
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
if
i
again
may
transgress
a
little
bit
that
the
--
there
are
no
allegations
in
this
petition
involving
interstate
commerce.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
as
there
was
in
the
farnsworth
case
out
of
tennessee
which
this
court
reversed
to
which
--
in
which
this
court
reverses
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee.
there's
nothing
in
this
record
showing
an
involvement
of
interstate
commerce
other
than
the
stipulation
of
counsel
at
the
time
of
the
interlocutory
hearing
which
was
done
as
an
accommodation
to
counsel
that
we
had
purchased
in
excess
of
$50,000
worth
of
commodities
out
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
had
them
shipped
to
the
plant
site
or
the
construction
site
of
this
sewage
disposal
plant
in
atlanta,
georgia.
now
counsel
doesn't
tend
to
be
tongue-in-cheek
and
denied
that
this
is
not
interstate
commerce,
but
the
fact
remains
is
your
honor
that
the
central
question
of
commerce
has
never
been
adjudicated
by
any
court.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
it
certainly
not
as
strong
as
a
stipulation
in
the
farnsworth
court
--
case,
mr.
justice
goldberg
in
which
counsel
stipulated
that
they
were
involved
in
interstate
commerce
in
which
they
stipulated
that
there
was
an
involvement
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
only
stipulation
in
this
case
is
that,
we
stipulate
that
we
purchased
more
than
$50,000
worth
of
goods
out
of
the
state
of
georgia.
i'm
inclined
to
believe
to
directly
answer
your
question
that
this
stipulation
was
intended
by
counsel
for
petition
to
show
that
this
is
involvement
of
interstate
commerce.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
this
is
a
standard
of
the
labor
relations
--
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
adopted
for
determining
this
jurisdiction.
and
at
the
time
of
stipulation
was
entered
to
by
counsel,
i
had
no
idea
of
its
ramification,
i
must
admit.
but
if
there
is
a
stipulation,
i
--
it's
certainly
not
as
strong
as
a
stipulation
in
the
farnsworth
case
in
which
the
whole
issue
before
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
was
jurisdiction
and
in
which
the
parties
in
that
case
readily
agreed
that
interstate
commerce
was
involved.
but
i
point
this
out
to
rebutt
the
montgomery
for
this
reason.
there
are
many
things
that
remain
to
be
done
in
the
supreme
court
--
in
the
trial
court
of
georgia.
i
think
i
ought
to
intend
to
stand
and
deny
to
this
court
that
there
are
any
additional
facts
regarding
labor
controversy.
i
think
the
facts
have
solidified.
i
think
the
facts
have
gelled
and
i
think
from
the
final
hearing
comes
up
that
the
only
additional
element
that
will
be
introduced
to
the
trial
court
as
far
as
this
respondent
here
is
concerned,
is
the
question
of
a
violation
of
the
contract
from
the
city
of
atlanta.
we
have
never
taken
the
position
that
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
violated
our
contract
with
the
city
of
atlanta
is
germane
to
the
issues
raised
in
our
pleadings
in
the
trial
court.
we
have
never
argued
the
question.
we
have
never
introduced
evidence
because
it's
been
our
position
and
it's
our
position
here
that
whether
or
not
this
respondent
has
violated
its
contract
with
the
city
of
atlanta,
it
has
no
bearing
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
petitioner
has
been
engaged
in
an
activity
which
violates
the
right
to
work
statutes
of
the
state
of
georgia.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
hearing
referred
to
by
the
petitioner
in
its
brief
before
the
alderman
of
the
city
of
atlanta,
we
did
at
this
time
substantiate
our
opposition
that
we
had
not
violated
the
contract.
we
did
introduce
evidence
showing
that
we
were
paying
a
prevailing
way
or
at
least
attempting
to.
and
this
is
the
only
party
and
this
was
not
affirmed
which
has
really
had
before
it
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
contract
was
violated.
this
is
simply
another
reason
that
we
point
out
to
the
court
while
this
--
why
the
montgomery
case
should
be
invoked
here.
now,
the
montgomery
case,
oddly
enough
was
argued
almost
10
days.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i
don't'
believe
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice.
we're
not
--
you're
not
being
asked
to
review
the
order
of
the
trial
court,
but
the
order
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
if
--
it
--
yes
sir,
so
far
as
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
upon
considering
that
within
remittitur
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
it
is
ordered
and
adjudged
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
be
made
the
judgment
of
this
court
and
the
same
be
entered
on
the
minutes.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
as
i
stated
your
honor
under
our
practice
in
georgia,
i
don't
believe
it
does
anything
other
than
enter
the
remittitur
from
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
on
the
trial
docket
and
on
the
minutes
of
that
court.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i
cannot
deny
that,
yes,
sir.
this
is
very
true.
i
think
we
could
go
in
at
any
time
after
a
remittitur
was
entered
and
have
gotten
an
affirmative
order
out
of
the
court
in
georgia.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
not
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
it's
been
my
experience
with
the
practice
in
georgia
that
when
a
remittitur
is
returned,
it's
an
obligation
of
counsel
to
go
to
the
court
and
ask
if
such
an
order
be
issued.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
if
he
wants
it,
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
that's
what
i
was
remarking
to
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i
don't
think
so,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i
think
so,
no
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
we
are
limited
to
--
we're
not
limited,
but
i
think
certainly
one
of
the
most
important
question
is
the
ledbetter
case.
and
in
the
time
remaining,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
it's
been
almost
10
years
ago
to
the
date
the
ledbetter
case
was
recently
argued
in
this
court
in
the
october
term
of
1952.
since
that
decision
to
my
knowledge,
the
ledbetter
case
or
the
montgomery
case
has
not
been
attacked
in
this
court
at
least
on
the
ground
upon
which
it
was
decided.
it
still
stands
today
as
a
decision
of
this
court
interpreting
the
question
of
finality
under
section
1257.
mr.
justice
frankfurter
spoke
in
the
wilde
case
as
counsel
referred
to
it
yesterday,
the
rule
in
the
montgomery
case
goes
further
than
some
antiquated
rule
of
procedure.
this
is
not
some
strangling
rule
that
this
court
has
applied
in
the
past
to
defeat
the
merits
of
the
case
as
it
come
up.
this
is
a
sale
route
and
as
it
--
as
expressed
in
the
montgomery
case
and
as
expressed
in
the
wilde
case,
this
is
the
wow
case.
the
real
reason
behind
this
rule
is
to
prevent
this
court's
piecemeal
interventions
with
state
procedure
before
state
procedure
has
reset
the
degree
of
finality
that
will
give
this
court's
ruling
some
meaning
and
some
substance.
if
the
montgomery
case
is
overturned,
the
practical
effect
of
it
in
labor
disputes
and
perhaps
in
other
disputes
--
in
other
types
of
disputes
if
this
court
goes
further
is
to
make
an
academic
blackboard
out
of
this
court
or
sounding
board
so
that
when
the
case
goes
back
down
to
final
disposition
in
the
trial
court
the
decision
of
this
court
might
become
entirely
moot
or
unrelated
for
the
eventual
issues
that
come
up
in
the
trial
court.
now,
i
think
it's
important
that
this
court
understand
one
thing
about
counsel
for
petitioner
in
his
able
argument
and
able
brief
as
pointed
out
that
the
practice
in
fulton
county
in
georgia
requires
some
12
to
15
months
for
a
final
disposition
of
a
case.
this
is
not
so
in
the
remainder
state.
this
court
is
undoubtedly
aware
we
do
have
a
populous
state
in
terms
of
county.
we
have
about
159
of
them
and
in
my
part
of
the
state,
this
case
would
be
disposed
of
in
three
months
when
it
came
back
on
a
final
hearing.
the
procedure
differs
of
course
due
the
complexity
of
calendars
on
various
courts.
but
i
don't
think
this
court
should
reach
any
decision
on
whether
or
not
montgomery
should
be
overruled
because
of
the
facts
in
fulton
county.
let's
consider
the
entire
state.
in
considering
the
entire
state,
on
our
practice
and
procedure
to
answer
some
questions
that
were
posed
earlier
to
counsel,
when
this
case
is
returned
to
the
trial
court
and
i
will
readily
concede
that
counsel
for
petitioner
the
minute
this
decree
came
there,
came
to
me
and
asked
to
stipulate
that
a
final
order
be
entered
and
that
the
final
hearing
be
waived.
but
having
been
spanked
once
by
counsel
on
the
$50,000
stipulation
i
agree
with
great
caution
his
request
and
we
did
not
agree
to
this
and
we
intended
to
leave
the
matter
for
final
disposition
at
the
final
hearing.
the
matter
now
stands
on
the
trial
docket
in
fulton
superior
court
for
final
hearing.
and
i
--
as
i've
said
previously,
i
don't
intend
to
disillusion
the
court
that
the
facts
involving
the
labor
dispute
are
gelled.
there
will
be
no
change
in
the
facts,
not
that
i
can
readily
concede,
but
there
is
one
important
point
that
remains
that
i
spoke
of
a
moment
ago
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
contract
with
the
city
of
atlanta
has
been
violated
because
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
actively
engaged
in
a
construction
work
the
contentions
of
the
petitioner
throughout
this
case
have
placed
to
sought
it
applied
on
this
reputation
and
we
intend
to
see
at
the
final
hearing
that
the
evidence
is
introduced
which
will
demonstrate
that
we
weren't
in
violation
of
our
contract
with
the
city
of
atlanta.
for
this
reason,
i
didn't
no
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
sir?
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
your
honor
in
all
fairness,
the
clerk
requested
the
counsel
sometime
before
last
week
as
to
whether
or
not
this
job
had
been
completed.
there's
no
reason
to
issue
on
a
permanent
injunction.
the
job
has
been
completed.
we've
been
paid,
we
own
it.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
we're
out
of
atlanta.
there's
nothing
left
to
be
done
on
the
job.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
your
honor,
i
can't
answer
that.
my
--
i
have
--
just
don't
have
that
much
practice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i
know
mr.
pearce
and
i
know
his
reputation.
i
m
sure
that
he
says,
this
is
so,
this
is
so.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
your
honor,
i
must
return
to
the
language
of
justice
minton
in
the
montgomery
case
that
the
--
this
argument
is
all
very
sound
but
the
fact
remains
is
that
under
the
previous
decision
of
this
court
and
under
limiting
authorities
of
section
1257,
the
reviewing
power
of
this
court
is
limited
to
a
final
decree
so
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
--
it
remains
to
be
done
in
this
case
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
as
your
honor
puts,
and
i
must
concede
that
this
is
a
very
persuasive
argument
as
to
the
definition
of
finality.
but
i
call
your
honors'
attention
in
the
instant
case
that
there
has
never
been
such
an
order
in
it
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
and
--
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
but
i
would
also
point
out
to
mr.
justice
black
that
in
this
case
alone,
taking
this
case
on
its
bear
facts
as
i've
said,
there's
a
various
substantive
point
of
law
that
must
be
decided
back
on
the
final
hearing
relating
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
violated
this
contract
with
the
city
of
atlanta.
this
has
never
been
determined.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
this
is
a
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
this
is
a
separate
question
your
honor.
i
think
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
and
well,
i
think
so
under
the
ledbetter
case.
yes,
sir.
i
would
--
i
would
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
mr.
justice
black
asked
me
a
difficult
question.
no,
i
will
not
your
honor.
i
don't
think
i
could
--
i'm
violating
my
client
most
particularly
myself
jeopardize
my
--
i'm
not
in
that
regard.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
one
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
you
mean
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
what
remains
to
be
done?
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i
think
your
honor
that
the
question
and
i
--
i'd
get
back
to
this.
i
think
that
what
remains
to
be
done
is
a
final
hearing
to
decide
--
now,
this
is
assuming
that
the
plea
in
abatement,
that
the
demurrers,
that
the
answered
filed
by
the
petitioner
all
leads
that
these
questions
are
considered
moot.
i
think
that
when
this
case
comes
up
for
final
hearing
in
fulton
superior
court,
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
respondent
that
we
intend
to
clarify
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we've
violated
our
contract.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
and
i
think
this
is
important.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
[inaudible]
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
of
course,
this
gets
in
to
what
i
call
the
second
grade
area
of
this
case
and
that
is
the
preemption
theory.
and
if
your
honor
will
permit
me,
i
would
like
to
state
here
our
feelings
about
this
--
about
preemption.
of
course,
it
is
a
contention
of
petitioner
and
i
will
have
to
agree
with
him
on
the
decision
of
this
court
that
if
there
is
a
violation
or
put
it
in
other
way,
if
there's
either
protected
activity
or
if
there's
a
violation
on
either
section
7
or
8
of
the
act,
then
these
people
are
protected
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
the
state
courts
are
deprived
a
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
this
court
has
clearly
held
this
in
the
florida
hotel
cases
and
then
farnsworth
case
out
of
tennessee.
this
is
no
longer
an
argument
in
issue.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
but
the
test
here,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
i've
seen
that
language
and
i've
seen
it
on
petitioner's
brief
that
the
--
this
case
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
--
where
the
--
whenever
the
fact
showed
that
it's
a
question
for
argument
then
the
state
courts
are
preempted.
now,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
another
provision
of
the
national
act
which
disturb
me,
if
they
are
not
put
there
for
a
purpose
and
this
is
principally
section
14
(b)
which
was
placed
there
by
the
1947
amendments.
certainly
that
congress
had
something
in
mind
when
they
specifically
stated
that
they
will
be
left
to
the
states
a
right
to
regulate
working
conditions
in
the
area
or
the
right
to
work
statute.
certainly
that
congress
meant
something,
when
it
left
to
the
states
specifically
an
area
in
which
the
states
was
still
free
to
regulate.
if
this
activity
or
the
petitioners
in
this
particular
case
is
not
protected
or
not
prohibited,
then
most
assuredly,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
jurisdiction
under
14
(b),
and
the
right
to
exercise
its
protected
powers
on
the
right
to
work
statute.
now,
i
think
really
that
the
critical
question
here
is,
does
the
record
show
or
do
the
facts
show
that
this
was
either
protected
or
prohibited
activity
because
if
it
does,
then
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
has
lost
its
jurisdiction
under
these
cases.
now
in
the
instant
case,
the
petitioner
cites
to
this
court
and
argued
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
that
the
reason
for
its
--
that
the
reason
it
was
protected
activity
that
this
was
an
effort
on
its
part
to
disseminate
to
the
public
working
conditions
which
were
repugnant
to
the
general
working
conditions
in
the
atlanta
area.
and
they
state
that
under
section
7
of
the
act
that
this
was
a
mutual
aid
or
protection.
this
is
what
they
were
seeking
and
that
this
conduct
was
protected
and
it
is
preempted.
now,
these
requires
an
additional
review
of
the
facts
in
this
case
and
let's
get
back
to
the
report
i
made
a
moment
ago
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
we
violated
our
contract
is
paramount
to
determining
whether
or
not
the
position
these
people
take
is
correct
or
not?
because
their
whole
argument
and
their
conduct
is
based
on
the
fact
that
we
violated
our
contract
and
they
readily
admitted
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
that
if
we
had
not
violated
our
contract,
this
would
not
be
protected
activity.
if
they
would
not
have
the
right
to
picket
and
to
carry
signs
saying
that
s.
j.
curry
&
company
had
violated
its
contract
with
the
city
of
atlanta.
so,
i
think
it's
very
important
that
the
court
considered
critically
and
carefully
the
facts
as
brought
up
on
the
record
and
the
same
facts
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
before
it.
now,
counsel
has
in
his
reply
brief
have
stated
that
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
has
cited
cases
in
support
of
its
position
being
with
the
fourteenth
amendment.
well,
this
is
true.
i
find
no
cases
of
this
court
dealing
with
this
specific
problem
that
we're
talking
about
now,
the
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner,
the
series
--
just
for
a
moment,
the
anheuser-busch
case
and
the
american
tobacco
company
case,
the
[inaudible]
case,
the
garmon
case,
all
of
these
cases
demonstrate
on
their
face
that
they
were
involved
either
with
section
7
or
section
8.
now,
this
case
on
its
facts,
i
believe,
does
not
show
that
there's
been
a
violation
or
protective
conduct
under
either
section
7
or
8.
the
petitioner
here
went
to
city
of
atlanta
or
first
of
all
and
went
to
this
respondent
on
its
jobsite
and
this
is
uncontradicted.
they
went
to
us
on
our
jobsite
in
february,
this
job
started
in
january
of
1961.
they
came
to
us
in
a
group
of
some
18
representatives
and
said,
“we'd
like
for
you
to
hire
union
people
on
this
job.”
this
was
refused.
the
statement
being
made
that
we
operated
an
open
shop.
thereafter,
the
petitioners
begin
a
very
concerted
and
lengthy
activity
of
trying
to
persuade
the
city
of
atlanta
that
we
were
violating
the
term
of
our
contract
by
not
paying
that
prevailing
wage.
now
at
the
initial
conference
on
february
the
14th,
no
mention
was
made
of
asking
us
to
raise
any
wage
standard
at
least
under
the
affidavits
of
the
respondent
they
were
not
and
as
i
read
the
affidavits
they're
not
--
this
is
not
contradicted.
the
statements
made
at
the
jobsite
were
“hire
union
laborer”
which
we
refused.
thereafter,
the
petitioners
began
as
i've
stated
a
concerted
activity
to
bring
the
city
of
atlanta
to
the
position
of
where
it
would
come
to
the
respondent
or
go
to
the
respondent
and
say,
you
are
violating
a
contract
rate
wage
level.
this
resulted
in
a
meeting
before
the
city
alderman.
it
resulted
in
meetings
with
the
city
attorney
and
eventually
the
city
of
atlanta
and
all
the
petitioners
that
there
was
nothing
they
could
legally
do
to
make
the
respondent
raise
its
wage
level.
thereafter
and
very
shortly
thereafter,
the
respondent
--
the
petitioner
placed
the
picket
on
our
jobsite
with
picket
signs
as
the
record
will
reveal
stating
in
substance
that
we
jave
violated
the
terms
of
our
contract
because
we
were
not
complying
with
the
provision
that
required
us
to
pay
the
prevailing
wage.
thereupon
and
this
is
also
undisputed,
thereupon,
the
jobsite
came
to
virtually
a
standstill.
we
lost
all
the
union
employees
and
as
a
virtue
--
by
virtue
of
that,
nonunion
employees
were
also
put
out
of
work
and
it's
on
these
facts
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
said,
“this
is
a
violation
of
the
right
to
work
statute”.
now
therein
lies
the
activity
of
the
petitioner
that
would
be
protected
under
the
national
act.
this
--
it
must
be
born
in
that
also,
a
stranger
picketing,
there
is
no
relationship
of
the
employee
or
the
employer.
there
was
no
labor
dispute.
this
is
simply
a
stranger
publicity
picketing.
while
i
recognize
that
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
such
picketing
is
protected
if
it's
done
on
the
mutual
aid
provision
of
section
7.
in
this
case
gentlemen,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
reviewing
a
decision
finds
that
this
conduct
was
inconsistent
with
the
right
to
work
statute
and
as
this
case
said
in
the
vogue
case
and
in
the
graham
case
out
of
virginia,
where
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
finds
and
makes
and
draws
a
conclusion
or
inference
from
the
record
that
the
conduct
was
inconsistent
with
the
right
to
work
statutes
for
that
particular
state,
then
it
might
rightfully
--
then
it
may
rightfully
enjoin
that
activity
or
conduct
as
being
in
violation.
now,
i
submit
as
it
was
stated
in
the
--
in
the
ballen
case
out
of
virginia
that
this
picketing
was
something
more
than
dissemination.
if
the
petitioner
had
really
been
interested
in
disseminating
to
the
general
public
as
it
states
that
it
was
a
question
of
violation
of
contract,
why
didn't
it
pick
a
medium
of
expression
which
would
not
have
resulted
in
job
interruption,
the
deprivation
of
work,
and
the
interruption
of
delivering
materials.
this
job
cycle
is
isolated
from
atlanta.
they
picked
a
method
of
picketing
which
they
knew
would
bring
economic
pressure
to
bear
upon
the
respondent
and
in
compliance
with
the
original
statement
made
at
the
jobsite
on
february
14th
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
concluded
that
this
was
activity
calculated
to
violate
the
right
to
work
statutes
of
the
state.
it
is
our
position
here,
it
was
our
position
to
the
supreme
court
that
the
record
amply
demonstrates
that
what
this
petitioner
was
asking
was
the
enforcement
of
provisions
which
would
violate
the
statutes
of
our
state,
relative
–
of
our
state,
relative
to
the
right
to
work
and
it
to
be
gainfully
employed,
and
to
carry
on
an
occupation
(inaudible)
without
interference.
it
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir.
well,
i
could
only
fall
back
from
the
record
your
honor
and
state
that
the
only
evidence
that
this
is
argued
--
arguably
permitted
under
the
act
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
this
was
dissemination.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
arguably
prohibited.
there
is
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
there
is
nothing
in
the
record,
your
honor,
to
show
that
the
conduct
of
the
petitioners
here
as
cited
in
the
case
and
they
cite
it
in
their
brief
was
any
activity
that
was
prohibited
under
sections
8
of
the
act.
that
is
there
was
no
attempt
-
there
was
no
attempt
to
force
a
union
contract
here.
there
was
no
attempt
to
make
any
move
or
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
involved
here
in
the
sense
of
section
8.
the
facts
clearly
show
that
there
was
no
relationship
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
or
between
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent's
employee.
so,
i
don't
know
how,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
could
be
any
prohibited
activity
as
there
was
in
the
anheuser-busch
case
for
instance,
where
the
petitioner
in
that
case
was
seeking
the
union
clause
contract
in
an
already
existing
contract.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
activity
here,
may
it
please
mr.
justice
goldberg,
which
was
prohibited
in
the
sense
of
the
act.
i
don't
think
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
comes
with
any
--
within
any
of
the
prohibitions
of
the
act.
more
empathetically,
i
think
that
what
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
does
come
within
is
section
14
(b),
that
section
which
leaves
to
the
state
a
right
to
promulgate,
and
regulate,
and
administer
right
to
work
statutes
of
their
own
choosing.
and
i
think
that
the
careful
review
of
the
record
will
show
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
might
post
and
add
that
of
course
this
court
is
cognizant
to
the
fact
that
it
won't
interfere
with
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
in
interpreting
its
own
laws
unless
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
a
violation
of
some
constitutional
right
of
the
petitioner
such
as
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
think
that
the
fact
show
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
analyzed
this
record
and
applied
the
decisions
of
that
state
in
arriving
at
its
decision
that
the
injunction
should
have
issued.
i
think
also,
may
it
please
the
court,
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
not
in
the
sense
that
i'm
sure
your
honor
means
it.
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
on
our
practice
when
an
interlocutory
order
was
carried
up
for
it
to
bill
of
exceptions
by
respondent
had
only
before
it
the
record
which
could
then
consisted
only
of
the
sworn
petition,
the
affidavits
attached
to
that
--
thereto
in
the
counter
affidavits
of
petitioner.
there's
no
other
force
in
the
record
involved
so
i
don't
know
how
they
could
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
this
is
the
point
i
was
making,
yes,
your
honor.
the
point
i'm
making
that
if
the
trial
court
decides
that
we
have
not
breached
our
contract
then
i
don't
believe
that
the
petitioner
can
substantiate
its
position
that
its
conduct
in
dissemination
of
information
was
any
protected
act
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
this
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
this
court
had
ruled
that
it
cannot.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
sir?
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i
was
not
determined
by
the
labor
board.
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
as
i
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
this
court
has
held
that
until
the
question
is
resolved
by
the
labor
board,
the
state
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
but
that
is
a
case
where
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
--
for
protected
or
prohibited
activity
and
then
in
this
case,
we're
dealing
with
neither,
it
is
our
contention.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
the
labor
board
if
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
i
don't
think
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
contract
with
the
city
of
atlanta
and
the
respondent
has
been
violated
would
ever
properly
be
before
the
labor
board,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
well,
i
mean
in
the
sense
that
the
legal
determination
of
whether
this
contract
has
been
violated
has
got
to
be
done
by
a
trial
court
in
georgia.
it's
the
only
forum
that
it
will
have
jurisdiction
to
determine.
i'm
not
so
sure
if
these
people
are
even
entitled
to
come
in
and
contend
that
we
violated
the
contract.
they're
not
parties
to
this
contract.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i
see
what
your
honor
means
now
and
i
did
misunderstand
your
question.
i
will
have
to
agree
that
the
question
as
it
relates
to
my
argument
concerning
their
protected
activity
would
be
a
board
determination
insofar
as
your
honor
posed
his
question.
now,
we
dealt
with
so
matters
outside
the
record.
i
would
mention
to
court
that
the
board's
jurisdiction
was
solicited
in
this
case
with
atlanta.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
no
sir.
it
is
not.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
i
misunderstood
justice
black
twice.
i
thought
that
he
had
rephrased
the
question.
i
state
that
the
final
determination
of
whether
the
contract
between
the
respondent
and
the
city
of
atlanta
has
been
violated
is
a
matter
of
the
state
court
insofar
as
it
relates
to
the
issues
brought
up
under
plea.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
as
i
understood
mr.
justice
black's
question
was
in
order
to
determine
whether
this
is
protected
or
prohibited
conduct,
this
is
a
board
matter.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
but
i
think
–-
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
i
would
not.
i
do
sir
--
the
reason
i
bring
up
the
--
if
you
refer
back
to
the
question
of
violation
of
the
contract
is
because
petitioner
says
that
because
of
the
breach
of
contract
they
are
entitled
under
the
protected
ambit
of
the
act
to
go
out
and
disseminate
to
the
general
public
the
question
or
rather
the
fact
that
we
have
not
complied
with
our
contract.
this
is
the
significance
of
this
--
of
the
argument.
i
mean,
they
say
that
the
language
on
the
picket
sign
is
true.
i
say
this
is
irrelevant
whether
the
contract
has
been
violated
or
whether
the
language
on
the
picket
line
isn't
--
i
mean,
the
picket
sign
is
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
issues
raised
on
the
petition
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
of
necessity,
yes,
sir,
or
some
other
facets
of
the
georgia's
right
to
work
statute.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
insofar
as
the
--
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
if
fact
was
the
purpose,
yes,
sir.
but
this
is
also
--
of
course
this
your
honor
brings
me
to
the
points
of
the
dilemma
that
this
is
also
a
violation
of
the
right
to
work
statute
and
as
i
said
previously
and
maybe
i
haven't
made
myself
clear
or
perhaps
i
have
diverged
too
much
from
my
argument
as
organized.
the
question
here,
granted
your
honor,
it
is
this
and
the
question
as
i
understand
it
has
never
been
decided
by
this
court.
the
farnsworth
case
which
is
cited
by
counsel
was
clearly
an
involvement
of
interstate
commerce.
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
dealt
specifically
with
jurisdiction.
the
georgia
court
has
not
done
this.
the
virginia
court
didn't
do
it
in
the
graham
case.
the
wisconsin
court
didn't
do
it
in
the
vogue
case.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
i'm
saying
that
this
is
possible
your
honor
and
also,
i
hope
i'm
making
clear
that
congress
must
have
had
some
intention
in
putting
the
14
(b)
into
the
act
to
clarify
this
very
situation.
now,
i'm
fully
cognizant
of
the
fact
as
this
court
has
ruled
numerous
decisions
very
recently
that
if
the
activity
is
protected
or
if
it
is
prohibited,
that's
it.
state
court
is
out
even
if
the
state's
rights
were
also
violated,
but
i
do
not
believe
this
court
has
ever
said
that
where
the
state
court
finds
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
right
to
work
statute
and
there
has
not
--
and
there
is
no
finding
of
protected
or
prohibited
activity
that
then
the
state
court
is
also
preempted.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes
sir,
it
does.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
yes,
sir.
it
does,
its
does
and
if
georgia
--
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
unfortunately
incorporates
an
earlier
decision
and
it
is
not
too
clear
in
this
facet.
i
would
say
that
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court
in
conclusion
that
our
argument
here
is
this
whether
it's
been
made
very
clear
that
remains
to
be
seen,
but
our
argument
here
is
this.
this
is
not
a
case
ripe
for
review
under
the
montgomery
decision.
the
court
is
ultimately
faced
with
the
decision
of
either
overruling
the
montgomery
decision
or
apply
it.
this
is
inescapable.
the
decisions,
that
is
the
montgomery
decision
and
the
curry
decision
are
too
closely
aligned
on
their
facts.
i
would
only
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
reasoning
of
this
court's
majority
opinion
in
the
montgomery
case
as
the
sound
application
of
the
rule
that
went
out.
i've
tried
to
demonstrate
due
to
the
complexities
of
this
case
that
we're
not
considering,
why
this
rule
should
be
further
enforced
to
prevent
this
court
interfering
in
substantive
matter
with
a
state
court
when
their
procedural
matter
is
still
indisposed
off.
secondly,
i
think
this
court
is
faced
with
the
question
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
jurisdiction
for
that
matter
to
the
trial
court
or
whether
it
was
preempted
under
section
6
or
7,
or
as
counsel
for
the
respondent
is
arguing,
whether
or
not
under
section
14
(b)
of
the
act,
the
state
of
georgia
was
entitled
to
promulgate
its
right
to
work
statutes
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
and
the
trial
court
were
entitled
to
enforce
it.
and
finally,
i
think
that
if
this
court
found
that
there
is
no
preemption,
if
this
court
finds
that
under
14
(b)
the
state
of
georgia
had
the
right
to
promulgate
and
to
administer
its
right
to
work
statutes,
then
i
think
it's
faced
with
the
decision
of
determining
whether
the
record
clearly
shows
that
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
merit
in
its
decision
and
whether
the
facts
there
to
substantiate
its
decision.
and
it
is
humbly
submitted
that
the
facts
are
there
in
the
record
as
shown
by
the
sworn
petition
and
the
affidavits.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
robert
b.
langstaff
no,
sir.
i
have
nothing
further.
i'd
be
glad
to
acquiesce
with
counsel
that
we
can
leave
this
with
the
clerk.
i
have
no
objection
if
the
court
prefer
it,
we'll
get
a
certified
copy
