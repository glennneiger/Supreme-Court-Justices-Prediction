suppose
the
defendants
three
days
after
the
court's
judgment
after
the
--
they
knew
about
the
judgment,
had
violated
the
terms
of
what
would
have
been
the
injunction
if
it
had
been
issued.
would
there
be
any
contempt?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
that
they
have
never
been
enjoined.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
there's
no
final
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
say
if
there
had
been
a
--
it's
been
entered
that
the
court
could
discontinue
this
technique
of
holding
up
the
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
things
like
this,
by
temporary
injunctions
and
they
could
never
get
it,
the
final
judgment
on
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
what
i'm
talking
about
is
that,
are
you
arguing
to
us
that
georgia
can
have
a
system
of
passing
on
these
things
which
by
the
process
of
interlocutory
injunctions
and
the
denials
they
give
it
in
the
failure
to
try
the
case
amounts
in
effect
to
disposing
off
the
case
against
a
union
before
it's
been
--
have
this
court
review
the
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
not
arguing
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
that.
do
you
mean
that
the
court,
supreme
court
can't
issue
its
own
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
could
have
--
they
could
have
said
we
enjoin
in
this
language,
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
could
have?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
if
when
--
since
they
said
it,
it
must
be
heard
and
must
be
entered
in
an
injunction
according
to
the
term
that
the
trial
court
did
go
contrary
to
the
supreme
court
and
issue
some
kind
of
--
a
different
kind
of
injunction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
had
to
issue
it
precisely
as
alleged,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
you
have
here
a
man
with
--
subject
himself
with
contempt.
he
might
get
out
by
saying
there
has
been
no
formal
order
signed
by
the
local
judge,
but
he
could
be
confined
to
this,
couldn't
he?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
just
ask
you
this
question
in
connection
with
that?
do
you
agree
that
in
fulton
county,
not
regard
with
the
others,
it
is
correct
wherever
a
temporary
injunction
was
issued
like
this,
that
is
like
it
could
be
15
months
before
there
can
be
a
trial
to
be
permanent.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
deny
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
being
the
case,
do
you
think
the
judgment
is
not
as
final
as
it
could
ever
get
that
a
situation
is
created
under
which
in
a
so-called
interlocutory
injunction,
absolutely
successfully
obliterates
the
rights
of
the
parties
to
be
--
get
the
benefit
of
the
laws
as
it
is
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
temporary
injunction
is
good
until
the
permanent
injunction
comes.
are
you
saying
that
that
can't
--
is
not
a
final
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right
but
what
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
statute
does
not
say,
it
never
had
said
that
a
final
judgment,
it
is
not
a
final
judgment
but
whatever
that
judgment
does
in
effect,
inevitably
cuts
off
--
and
irrevocably
cuts
off
the
rights
of
the
parties.
the
statute
doesn't
say
that,
that's
a
definition
of
findings.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
to
all
intents
and
purposes,
why
is
not
this
--
why
is
not
a
judgment
of
this
kind
final
where
labor
disputes
are
involved,
the
labor
disputes
are
going
to
get
over,
and
inevitably
the
court's
order
means
that
the
labor
dispute
must
be
law
because
of
the
injunction
by
one
party.
how
can
there
be
any
logical
or
reasonable
or
sound
just
definition
that
would
take
that
out
of
the
word
final
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that's
a
different
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there's
a
question
of
whether
you
have
jurisdiction
--
whether
the
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction.
that's
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
whether
it
should
be
up
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
that's
the
question
involved,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
may
i
ask
you
just
one
other
question
because
your
georgia
lawyer
and
you
know
more
than
your
[inaudible],
if
you
are
representing
the
defendants
as
the
georgia
law
in
a
case
like
this,
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
had
said,
“you
got
to
issue
an
injunction
according
to
this
petition,”
would
you
subject
yourself
to
the
possibility
of
contempt
by
violating
the
terms
of
the
order
if
it's
--
on
the
theory
that
it
had
not
been
issued?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
in
that
connection
before
you
do,
does
that
--
did
the
supreme
court
have
to
rely
on
findings
of
the
fact
of
any
kind
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
this
was
not
before
the
labor
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'm
thinking
of
was
your
argument
about
the
facts
you
say
you
had
not
breached
the
contract
and
therefore
since
you
had
not
breached
the
contract,
it
was
not
on
the
case
of
which
the
labor
board
could
arguably
take
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
the
answer
to
the
question
i'm
about
to
ask
you,
but
assuming
what
you
say
there
is
a
true,
one
of
the
theories
of
--
under
which
--sometimes
agencies
are
given
the
power
to
determine
the
facts
is
that
on
which
their
jurisdiction
tends
is
that
they're
the
ones
who
have
the
power
to
determine
and
not
the
state
courts.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
now,
was
not
that
a
subject
where
--
by
which
facts
had
to
be
introduced
which
the
labor
board
at
the
time
they
had
basic
right
to
determine,
could
the
state
court
decide
that
in
advance
of
the
labor
board's
hearing
to
determine
whether
it
had
jurisdiction?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
was
that
(voice
overlap)
determined
by
the
labor
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
was
that
to
be
determined
by
the
labor
board?(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
it
depends
on
the
finding
of
fact
which
can
find
those
facts,
the
state
or
the
labor
board?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
why
i
thought
maybe
that
you
had
argued
there
about
the
contract
that
said
that
the
facts
were
different
to
what
they
claimed
different?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
connection
with
that
jurisdiction.
if
you
say
that
would
take
it
out
from
under
their
jurisdiction.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
they
did?
i
haven't
made
it
clear
and
maybe
i
can't
but
if
the
--
if
that
is
crucial
to
a
holding
of
whether
the
labor
board
has
jurisdiction
respect
to
that
contrary.
why
are
they
not
the
ones
who
are
entitled
to
try
that
so
far
as
this
labor
board's
jurisdiction
is
concerned?
