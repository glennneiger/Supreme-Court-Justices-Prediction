justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
--
did
you
appear
in
court
when
they
mandated
the
georgia
court
thorough
your
trial
court,
the
trial
court
that
is
the
one
that
actually
entered
the
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
--
there's
no
appearances,
nothing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
what
did
they
--
what
did
the
court
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
injunction
issued?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
did
not
issue
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
(inaudible)
--
is
the
injunction
issued
there
or
not
in
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
still
don't
know
what
is
the
--
i
just
still
don't
know
whether
injunction
had
been
issued
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
all
that
said
is
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
is
made
the
judgment
of
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
doesn't
enter
an
injunction
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
ground
did
the
lower
court
deny
the
injunction,
was
that
an
oral
opinion
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
his
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
did
you
try
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
mean
it
could
have
been
--
that
it's
equitably
--
it
was
on
equitable
grounds
that
the
--
that
this
injunction
--
interim
injunction
wasn't
necessary
here
or
advisable
or
authorized
or
justify
it?
didn't
they
get
to
the
jurisdictional
point
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
other
argument
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
other
argument
did
you
make?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
--
would
you
say
then
these
people
are
not
restrained
from
doing
what
they're
doing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
the
local
practice?
he
said,
the
practice
is
not
to
in
--
not
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
when
you
do
that,
do
you
do
it
ex
parte?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
do
you
know
--
how
does
the
trial
court
know
which
injunct
--
what
the
terms
of
the
injunction
should
be
without
having
some
agreement
as
to
the
form
at
least
to
--
from
a
--
from
somebody.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
injunctions
--
when
an
injunction
is
in
construction
sites
for
picketing
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
did
the
--
we
may
have
the
remittitur
in
the
whole
record,
the
unfinished
part.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
in
the
printed
record
but
i
suppose
there
was
an
original
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
all?
well,
what
would
they
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
making
the
--
entering
the
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
entering
the
judgment
but
do
you
say
that's
not
the
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
disagree
that
the
--
you
disagree
with
opposing
counsel
as
to
what
the
practice
is,
as
to
what
is
the
injunction
[inaudible]
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
so
that
the
district
court,
i
mean,
your
trial
court
does
not
automatically
and
in
a
ministerial
manner
enter
the
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
remittitur
in
so
many
words
or
in
terms
did
not
direct
the
entry
of
an
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
judge
was
not
automatically
under
a
duty
--
under
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
or
under
the
remittitur
or
the
mandate
that
came
down
that
entered
the
injunction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
it
mean
that
--
does
it
mean
that
when
as
and
if
you
asked
for
an
injunction,
you're
titled
--
entitled
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
wants
(inaudible)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
asked
for
an
injunction
--
permanent
injunction,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
got
to
press
for
the
permanent
injunction,
i
take
it.
