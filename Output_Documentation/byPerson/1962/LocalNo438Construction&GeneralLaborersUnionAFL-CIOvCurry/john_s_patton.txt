mr.

if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
john
s.
patton
--
i
am
john
patton,
mr.
pearce’s
associate.
we
were
going
to
divide
the
argument.
mr.
john
s.
patton
if
--
mr.
john
s.
patton
if
your
honor
please,
while
we
normally
feel
that
a
divided
argument
is
not
the
best
procedure,
we
felt
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
issues
divide
themselves
into
two
rather
distinct
issues
which
made
it
capable
of
divided
argument.
those
issues
being
whether
the
decision
from
which
the
certiorari
was
prayed
was
a
final
order
which
permitted
this
court
to
properly
grant
certiorari
and
also
the
merits
the
case.
it
was
our
feeling
that
if
it
--
for
satisfaction
to
the
court
that
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
first
discuss
the
evidence
and
the
merits
of
the
case
for
the
reason
that
then
it
would
be
easier
having
already
presented
that
to
the
court
for
the
court
to
then
have
presented
to
it
this
question
of
finality.
mr.
john
s.
patton
very
well,
your
honor.
if
your
honor
please,
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
having
granted
an
interlocutory
injunction
overruling
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
which
had
denied
the
injunction.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
these.
the
city
of
atlanta,
georgia
determined
to
build
a
sewage
disposal
plant
known
as
the
south
river
sewage
disposal
plant
and
invited
competitive
bids
to
--
of
general
contractors
to
bid
on
those
premises.
among
those
bidding
was
the
defendant
in
certiorari
s.
j.
curry
and
company
what
i’ll
refer
to
as
curry.
the
bid
of
curry
was
a
successful
bid
being
the
lowest
bid
and
therefore
a
contract
was
entered
into
between
the
city
of
atlanta
and
curry,
for
curry
to
construct
this
sewage
disposal
plant.
now
in
that
contract,
there
were
the
following
words,
“wages
are
to
conform
with
those
being
paid
on
similar
types
of
work
in
the
atlanta
area.”
the
evidence
was
undisputed
that
this
provision
of
the
contract
was
being
violated
and
that
the
wages
that
were
being
paid
in
this
construction
was
substantially
less
than
that
of
similar
types
of
work
in
the
atlanta
area.
the
record
shows
that
a
conference
was
held
in
the
month
of
february
between
certain
labor
leaders
and
s.
j.
curry
and
company
and
i
will
go
into
the
details
of
that
competence
--
conference
a
little
further
in
my
discussion,
but
a
conference
was
held
and
then
for
the
following
six
months,
efforts
were
made
by
the
plaintiff
in
certiorari
to
prevail
upon
the
city
to
enforce
its
contract
with
reference
to
wages
and
to
require
that
wages
be
paid
in
accordance
with
the
general
standard
in
the
atlanta
area.
now
failing
in
that
effort
both
in
conversations
with
the
city
attorneys
and
various
officials
and
also
in
presenting
the
matter
to
the
city
board
of
aldermen,
finally
as
a
last
resort,
picketing
was
resorted
to,
the
picket
sign
reading.
s.
j.
curry
and
company,
violating
contract
with
the
city
of
atlanta
by
not
paying
wages
conforming
with
those
of
a
similar
type
of
work
in
the
atlanta
area,
construction
and
general
laborers’
union
number
438,
afl-cio.
curry
filed
a
petition
in
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county,
georgia
to
bring
that
injunction
issue
restraining
such
picket.
this
came
on
in
due
course
to
be
heard
on
application
for
interlocutory
decree
at
which
time,
judge
farr,
the
superior
court
judge,
denied
the
draft
for
injunction,
whereupon
curry
appealed
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
georgia
which
court
overruled
judge
farr
and
held
that
injunction
should
issue.
the
case
then
was
carried
to
this
court
by
means
of
certiorari
which
was
granted.
this
court
in
granting
certiorari
restricted
the
issues
in
this
case
to
the
question
of
whether
certiorari
should
be
granted
in
view
of
the
case
of
montgomery
versus
ledbetter
which
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
final
order
in
this
stage.
and
also,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
issues
of
this
case
were
either
protected
or
were
--
would
come
under
the
area
which
would
come
under
violations
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
in
other
words,
whether
the
issues
were
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
it
is
the
position
of
the
defendant
in
certiorari
in
his
brief
insofar
as
the
merits
of
the
cause
are
concerned
that
it
is
true
that
if
the
issues
of
this
case
are
either
protected
or
are
violated
under
the
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
it
is
a
preempted
field.
on
the
other
hand,
he
insists
and
he's
almost
in
time
insistence
is
that
the
actions
in
this
cause
constituted
a
violation
of
the
so-called
right-to-work
laws
of
the
state
of
georgia
and
that,
that
being
true,
the
state
of
georgia
would
have
jurisdiction
in
this
matter.
now,
it
is
our
very
definite
insistence
that
the
evidence
does
not
permit
of
a
conclusion
that
the
state
right-to-work
laws
have
been
in
anyway
violated.
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
to
the
court
though
that
even
aside
from
that
which
i
prefer
to
deal
with,
even
if
they
had
been
violated,
the
actions
would
still
have
fallen
under
the
area
exclusively
assumed
by
the
national
labor
relations
board,
and
that
the
issues
would
still
be
preempted.
now
in
support
of
his
position,
counsel
for
defendant
in
certiorari
cites
the
algoma
plywood's
case
of
this
court,
but
in
the
garmon
case
in
a
footnote,
this
court
had
this
remark
with
reference
to
the
algoma
case.
the
approach
taken
in
that
case
in
which
the
court
undertook
for
itself
to
determine
the
status
of
the
disputed
activity
has
not
been
valid
in
later
decisions
and
is
no
longer
a
general
application.
so
i
submit
that
that
case
has
been
repudiated.
now,
the
other
authorities
which
he
cites
are
the
plumbers
versus
graham,
building
service
employees
versus
gazzam,
teamster
versus
hanke
and
teamsters
versus
wohl.
none
of
those
cases
in
any
way
involved
a
question
of
federal
preemption.
all
of
those
cases
dealt
only
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
action
of
the
state
court,
deprived
the
party
of
freedom
of
speech
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
it
does
not
appear
in
those
cases
whether
or
not
these
companies
were
engaged
in
interstate
commerce
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
its
implication
is
not
discussed
in
any
of
these
cases
and
none
of
the
cases
that
are
cited
by
the
defendant
in
anyway
relate
to
the
question
of
federal
preemption,
but
purely
to
the
question
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now
the
only
authority
which
i
know
squarely
deals
with
this
point
that
insofar
as
this
court
is
concerned
is
the
case
of
farnsworth
&
chambers
versus
electrical
workers,
353
u.s.
969.
now,
i
might
state
that
in
my
reply
brief,
the
citation
to
the
southwestern
reporter
of
tennessee
court
was
erroneous.
it
was
229
in
the
brief.
it
should
have
been
299
southwestern
second
8,
299
southwestern
second
page
8.
now
the
state
supreme
court
in
that
case
stated
this,
this
is
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
tennessee.
the
demurrers
filed
to
the
original
and
supplemental
bill,
raised
one
issue,
and
that
is
whether
the
courts
of
tennessee
have
the
power
to
enforce
the
right-to-work
law
or
whether
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
in
the
enactment
of
the
labor
management
act
to
so
exclusively
preemptive
field
of
labor
management
relations
in
interstate
commerce
as
to
remove
the
matter
from
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts.
now,
in
reference
to
the
facts,
the
state
supreme
court
said
this.
it
seems
that
before
this,
a
representative
of
the
labor
union
approached
the
management
of
complainant
and
protested
that
complainant
was
not
employing
union
labor
and
threatened
to
picket
the
plant
if
union
laborers
were
not
employed.
complainant
refused
to
employ
union
labor
and
picketing
resulted.
the
state
courts
held
that
it
had
jurisdiction
in
this
cause
because
of
the
state
right-to-work
laws.
this
court
in
a
per
curiam
opinion,
held
as
follows.
the
petition
for
writ
certiorari
is
granted
and
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
tennessee
is
reversed,
weber
versus
anheuser-busch
and
garner
versus
teamsters.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
if
your
honors
will
of
course
recognize
those
two
as
landmark
decisions
dealing
with
the
subject
of
federal
preemption.
now,
i
would
like
to
further
point
out
to
the
court
insofar
as
the
alleged
right-to-work
law
is
concerned
that
even
if
there
was
an
area
in
which
the
state
can
act
therein
that
the
decision
of
where
that
area
would
lie
would
be
for
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
determine
as
to
whether
they
had
jurisdiction
or
whether
it
was
a
matter
concerning
which
the
state
could
lie
because
it
fell
beyond
that
jurisdiction.
this
court
has
definitely
held
that
if
a
matter
is
even
argued
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
then
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
a
proper
forum
to
go
to,
to
make
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
a
national
labor
relations
board
matter.
otherwise,
we
would
have
a
conflict
that
this
court
discussed
in
the
garner
case
with
the
state
court
holding
one
way
and
the
labor
board
holding
another.
now
in
the
case
of
san
diego
building
trades
council
versus
garner,
this
court
said
this,
“at
times,
it
is
not
been
clear
whether
the
particular
activity
regulated
by
the
states
was
governed
by
section
7
or
section
8
or
was
perhaps
outside
both
these
sections,”
but
courts
are
not
primary
tribunals
to
adjudicate
such
issue.
it
is
essential
to
the
administration
of
the
act
that
these
determinations
be
left
in
the
first
instance
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
what
is
outside
the
scope
of
this
court's
authority
cannot
remain
with
any
state's
power
and
state
jurisdiction
too
must
yield
to
the
exclusive
primary
competence
of
the
board.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
over
and
above
and
the
side
from
that
issue
which
i
think
is
sound
in
itself
and
determinative
of
the
facts
of
the
matter,
i
wish
to
respectfully
submit
that
not
only
does
the
problem
as
to
a
question
of
arguability
but
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
in
the
evidence
for
a
finding
that
the
state
right-to-work
laws
have
been
violated.
of
course,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
georgia
merely
saying
that
they
have
been
violated
would
not
confer
jurisdiction
unless
the
evidence
established
the
fact
that
they
were
violated
even
if
that
would
give
the
state
court
jurisdiction.
this
court
in
the
case
of
plumbers
and
steamfitters
versus
graham
said
in
that
connection.
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
we
are
justified
in
searching
the
record
to
determine
whether
the
critical
findings
of
the
state
courts
had
a
reasonable
basis
in
the
evidence.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
the
contention
that
the
right-to-work
laws
had
been
violated
which
is
made
by
my
opponent,
is
based
upon
a
conference
which
was
held
on
february
the
14th,
1961
at
which
certain
labor
leaders
appeared
and
also
the
secretary
of
the
building
trades
council
was
present.
it
does
not
affirmatively
appear
in
the
transcript
whether
anyone
was
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
in
certiorari.
however,
possibly,
it
may
be
inferred
that
they
were
and
even
if
it
so
inferred,
i
do
not
think
it
--
in
any
way
would
change
the
situation.
it
is
alleged
that
at
that
meeting,
a
statement
was
made
that
the
company
must
have
union
labor
and
that
they
would
see
that
it
was
done
to
some
such
statement.
however,
if
your
honors
please,
nothing
was
ever
done
to
implement
such
a
statement.
they
--
no
picketing
resulted
bothering
that
conference
and
the
picketing
out
of
which
this
case
arose
did
not
result
until
a
good
six
months
later
on
august
the
10th,
1961.
now
during
the
intervening
months,
this
is
what
happened.
the
union
discovered
--
the
union
was
aware
of
the
fact,
made
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
wages
were
not
being
paid
as
required
by
the
city's
contract
and
that
therefore
the
wages
in
the
area
were
being
depressed
as
a
result
of
this
failure
to
abide
by
the
contract.
therefore,
the
matter
was
taken
up
with
the
city
of
atlanta
and
numerous
conferences
were
held
with
the
city
attorney
and
other
officials
of
the
city
of
atlanta,
in
an
effort
to
get
the
city
of
atlanta
to
enforce
its
contract
and
require
that
the
wage
scale
should
be
raised
to
conform
to
the
contract.
and
the
evidence
is
undisputed
that
these
conferences
were
held
that
this
is
what
transpired
and
the
evidence
is
undisputed
that
it
was
affirmatively
stated
to
the
city
that
they
were
not
concerning
themselves
in
anyway
with
who
worked
on
the
job.
but
that
they
were
concerning
themselves
only
with
the
question
of
wages.
certainly,
that
would
be
a
complete
repudiation
of
any
idea
that
they
weren't
any
way
seeking
a
violation
of
the
state
right-to-work
laws.
after
months
of
such
conferences
without
avail,
as
a
last
resort,
the
matter
was
carried
to
the
city
board
of
alderman,
the
final
authority
so
far
as
the
city
was
concerned
and
after
a
full
hearing
there,
this
was
the
minutes
of
the
board
of
alderman.
after
lengthy
discussion,
this
matter
was
referred
to
executive
session
where
the
committee
agreed
that
there
is
nothing
that
the
city
legally
can
do
so
as
to
make
curry
raise
his
pay
scale.
not
one
word
as
to
who
was
employed,
not
one
intimation
in
the
record
that
any
request
was
made
of
the
city
board
of
alderman,
the
city
attorney
or
anyone
else
in
these
conferences
having
anything
to
do
with
employment,
but
only
the
wage
scale.
now
the
union
showed
the
patience
of
job
in
this
matter.
they
resorted
every
possible
means
of
getting
the
city
to
maintain
the
wage
scale
by
enforcing
its
contract
and
it
was
only
after
carrying
it
to
the
highest
authority
in
the
city,
all
else
having
failed,
and
being
turned
down
by
the
board
of
alderman
that
they
resorted
to
the
only
remaining
recourse
which
was
to
advertise
to
the
people
on
the
job
who
were
being
paid
less
than
they
were
entitled
to
under
the
contract
by
means
of
picket
signs
what
was
going
on
and
to
present
to
the
public
the
fact
by
their
city
officials
who
are
not
imposing
a
contract
which
had
been
enacted
for
the
benefit
of
labor
in
this
particular
case.
therefore,
they
did
erect
this
picket
sign
saying
s.
j.
curry
and
company
is
violating
contract
with
city
of
atlanta
by
not
paying
wages
conforming
with
those
of
a
similar
type
of
work
in
the
atlanta
area.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
georgia
intimates
to
a
certain
extent
that
they
have
jurisdiction
because
it
is
a
strange
picketing.
i
do
not
think
that
they
expressly
say
so
but
they
discussed
the
fact
that
no
one
was
working
--
who
was
working
on
the
job
was
engaged
in
the
picketing.
now,
if
your
honors
please,
that
would
in
no
way
confer
jurisdiction
upon
the
state
court.
certainly,
it
is
a
protected
right
under
section
7
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
it
is
concerted
activity
and
for
this
reason,
the
evidence
clearly
establishes
for
that
contradiction
and
i
think
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
fact
if
it
did
not
so
establish
that
these
jobs
in
the
construction
industry
are
given
on
competitive
bids.
the
result
is
the
one
that
makes
the
lowest
bid
gets
the
job.
the
company
that's
undercutting
the
standards
and
is
destroying
the
wage
structure
and
the
standard
of
living
is
enabled
there
by
to
make
the
lowest
bid
and
if
otherwise
competent
will
get
the
job.
then
that
puts
the
question
before
the
others
who
are
paying
the
staff
and
upholding
the
wages
within
the
area
have
two
choices,
either
they
continue
to
pay
the
standard,
lose
the
bids
and
as
a
result
of
that
are
forced
into
bankruptcy
or
else
they
reduce
the
wages
to
the
place
where
they
can
meet
the
competition
and
having
so
reduced
them,
then
they
can
bid
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
current.
now,
the
result
of
this
cycle
is
that
all
of
the
hard
one
--
efforts
to
raise
the
standard
of
living
in
the
atlanta,
georgia
area
are
completely
undermined
and
completely
destroyed.
and
these
people
are
fighting
for
self-preservation.
they
are
fighting
to
maintain
the
wage
area
standards
within
the
atlanta
area.
now
this
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
cases
involving
so-called
stranger
picketing
that
it
is
not
the
matter
for
the
state
courts
to
concern
themselves
with.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
hotel
employees
versus
sax
who
had
a
case
of
organizational
picketing,
the
case
of
san
diego
building
trades
versus
garmon
was
one
way
the
union
sought
to
compel
the
company
to
execute
a
union
shop-contract
when
they
did
not
represent
the
employees
and
thereby
to
force
the
employees
into
the
union.
the
case
of
garner
versus
teamsters,
the
union
was
picketing
for
the
purpose
of
inducing
employees
to
join
the
union.
meat
cutters
versus
fairlawn
meats
was
an
attempt
for
the
union
not
representing
the
majority
of
employees
to
compel
an
employee
or
to
force
its
employees
into
the
union.
and
then
the
very
recent
case
of
waxman
versus
commonwealth
of
virginia,
this
court
held
that
any
stranger
picketing
situation
that
the
state
of
virginia
would
not
be
permitted
to
act,
but
it
was
a
purely
and
completely
preempted
field.
now
i
respectfully
submit,
if
your
honors
please,
that
this
--
that
the
union
has
not
violated
any
law,
state
or
federal,
and
is
exercising
a
privilege
which
is
vital
and
important
to
the
labor
movement.
but
if
a
law
had
been
violated,
it
would
have
been
section
8
(b)
(2)
and
8
(b)
(7)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
if
it
was
an
attempt
to
en
--
to
force
employees
into
the
union
as
is
apparently
contended
by
the
opposition.
and
in
that
event
also,
it
would
be
clearly
preempted
and
the
case
has
been
carried
to
the
wrong
forum.
so
i'm
--
mr.
john
s.
patton
if
your
honor
please,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
georgia
expressly
held
that
the
picketing
was
entirely
peaceful
and
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
any
violence
or
any
need
of
exercise
of
the
police
power.
if
your
honors
please,
i
will
now
turn
it
over
to
mr.
pearce
and
he
will
discuss
the
other
part.
mr.
john
s.
patton
i
don't
think
--
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
judge
[inaudible]
--
to
see
if
i
can
remember
the
record,
i
do
not
believe
this
judge
specifically
enumerated
the
grounds
others
to
see
--
mr.
john
s.
patton
the
jurisdictional
point
was
very
earnestly
argued
by
me,
may
it
please
the
court,
and
insisted
upon
as
a
ground
and
as
the
ground
on
which
the
injunction
should
be
denied.
that
was
the
argument
that
i
made
and
the
primary
argument
that
i
made.
mr.
john
s.
patton
and
the
court
--
mr.
john
s.
patton
that
is
correct
and
the
court
simply
entered
this
order.
now,
i
do
not
recall
that
he
made
an
oral
attention
from
the
--
as
such
from
the
bench.
there
was
some
[inaudible]
between
counsel
and
the
court
but
i
don't
think
that
there
was
--
he
announced
any
the
opinion
from
the
bench
but
entered
it.
mr.
john
s.
patton
is
the
court
through
with
me?
i'm
through,
if
the
court's
through
with
me.
