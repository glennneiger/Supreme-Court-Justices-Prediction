mr.
edwin
pearce
mr.
chief
justice
warren
and
members
of
the
court.
we
thought
that
the
aspect
of
this
case
regarding
finality
was
sufficiently
separate
where
it
could
be
appropriately
discussed
separately.
i
should
like
to
state
the
general
basis
on
which
we
are
approaching
this
matter.
one
is
the
area
whereby
the
court
has
increasingly
begun
to
look
at
the
practical
or
the
substantial
meaning
of
finality
rather
than
the
purely
technical
meaning
and
then
secondly,
which
is
a
part
of
this,
to
what
extent
does
the
fact
that
the
question
arising
is
the
unlawful
exercise
of
jurisdiction
in
a
federally
preempted
area
which
results
on
a
substantial
denial
of
a
federally
derived
and
federally
protected
area,
to
what
extent
does
that
enter
in
to
the
practical
consideration
of
the
approach
to
what
is
meant
by
found?
mr.
edwin
pearce
i
will
try
to
make
a
double
play,
if
you
please.
i
will
suggest
that
ledbetter
should
be
overruled
or
also
give
this
court
reasons
why
this
case
is
not
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
--
necessarily
follow
it.
it
would
have
to
follow
that
(inaudible).
mr.
edwin
pearce
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
edwin
pearce
i
had
not
intended
to
discuss
it.
i
am
apparently
interested
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
to
be
sure,
i
understand
that
you
would
mean
the
power
of
--
for
example
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
edwin
pearce
yes
sir.
alright,
i
will
be
glad
to
do
that
and
i
appreciate
the
opportunity.
let
me
say
at
the
outset
the
duty
as
one
case
that,
i
am
apologetic,
did
not
get
in
our
brief
and
should
certainly
be
considered
by
this
court.
i'm
going
to
mention
it
and
it's
a
case
of
pope
against
atlantic
coast
line.
mr.
edwin
pearce
pope,
p-o-p-e
versus
atlantic
--
versus
atlantic
coast
line.
the
citation
is
345
u.s.
379.
mr.
edwin
pearce
the
citation,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
345
u.s.
379.
that
is
certainly
a
case
that
ought
to
be
considered
in
connection
with
this
discussion.
now
the
departure
of
this
court
from
a
purely
technical
approach
to
the
meaning
of
finality
started
a
long
time
ago.
i
think
perhaps
in
the
time
of
mr.
justices
taney.
at
least
a
great
–
it
appeared
somewhat
remote
from
the
labor
area
that
we
had
been
in
the
last
10
to
12
years.
the
court
has
decided
that
it
is
not
bound
by
technical
matters
such
is
--
such
as,
is
there
anything
else
to
do
in
the
state
court.
the
first
departure
from
that
i
believe
is
just
a
matter
of
interest
to
when
the
only
thing
to
be
done
in
the
state
court
was
purely
ministerial,
but
the
departure
has
--
i
think
before
this,
the
present
personnel
of
the
court
came
upon
the
bench
that
already
reached
a
more
pronounced
departure
than
that.
the
court
has
determined
and
i
think
it
must
determine
and
must
continue
to
determine
otherwise
we
have
a
completely
dominant
technical
rule
that
would
not
be
workable
that
this
court
will
look
at
the
substance
to
see
if
the
decision
you're
being
asked
to
review
has
finally
been
passed
upon
by
a
court
of
last
resort
of
the
state.
in
other
words,
has
the
highest
court
of
the
state
had
to
point,
have
they
decided
it
and
with
finality
as
far
as
they
are
concerned
and
then
is
it
right
for
presentation
here.
a
number
of
elements
should
have
been
injected
into
this
formula
by
the
court
in
the
development
of
this.
i
will
only
go
back
in
just
a
very
few
cases
i
have
to
mention
approximately
--
well
back
to
1947
when
the
labor
cases
first
began
to
get
into
the
picture.
and
the
case
that
i
--
we
have
in
the
brief,
the
myers
case
is
not
exactly
is
a
case
where
the
federal
court
is
deciding
whether
it
will
review
an
order
of
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
is
not
quite
the
same,
i
realize
as
reviewing
the
state
court
and
i
mentioned
it
only
because
some
observations
by
mr.
justice
brandeis
began
to
introduce
some
elements
of
practicality
into
this
rule
that
we
have
later
developed.
there,
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
united
states
district
court
could
enjoin
the
national
labor
relations
board
for
processing
an
unfair
labor
practice
case
against
an
employer.
and
there
were
split
of
circuits
and
this
court
took
it,
but
this
court
was
taking
a
review
of
a
preliminary
injunction
which
it
was
operating
under
different
statutes.
i
don't
see
it's
binding
as
precedent
but
i
simply
say
that
this
is
the
first
time
that
a
review
of
a
preliminary
injunction
was
sought
before
this
court
on
the
basis
that
it
should
be
done
to
protect
jurisdiction
where
there
is
conflict
of
rights
and
jurisdiction
under
the
proce
--
under
the
federal
system.
mr.
justice
brandeis
said,
“that
rule
of
practice,
referring
to
the
rule
of
practice
that
you
will
not
review
anything
that
is
repugnant
has
no
application
whereas
here”
there
was
an
insuperable
objection
to
the
maintenance
of
the
suit
in
point
of
jurisdiction.
in
other
words,
if
a
court
is
proceeding
without
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
to
handle
anyhow
and
thus
deny
rights
that
is
final
enough
to
where
it
is
properly
brought
to
this
court,
we
should,
says
this
court,
“we
should
take
cognizance
of.”
mr.
edwin
pearce
that
is
a
case
of
myers
against
bethlehem
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
--
shipbuilding
corporation
in
the
citation
303,
41.
i
think
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
less
important
of
the
cases
i
have
in
that
we're
talking
about
reviewing
federal
courts
rather
than
state
courts.
but
very
shortly
after
that,
we
have
the
case
of
station
wow
versus
johnson
which
we've
been
calling
back
home
the
wow
case.
it's
derived
from
woodmen
of
the
world
and
we've
got
that
designation
because
when
our
lawyer
found
it,
he
said,
wow!
i
found
a
case.”
now
we've
called
it
the
wow
case.
it's
a
case
in
which
this
court
reviewed
a
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
i
believe
of
nebraska
where
that
court
had
reversed
the
trial
court
and
sent
the
case
back,
requiring
the
trial
court
to
order
that
certain
property
be
delivered
back
from
a
lessee
to
a
lessor
and
that
an
accounting
be
held.
now
this
court,
facing
the
question
of
finality
said,
“yes,
there
is
something
else
to
be
done
in
this
case.
there
is
not
only
the
order
of
the
property
be
delivered
back
but
there's
going
to
be
in
the
state
court
an
accounting
of
moneys
during
the
period
of
the
lease
that
was
being
invalidated.”
but
this
court
said
two
things,
one
is,
it's
important
because
they'll
have
to
give
the
property
back
immediately
and
that's
an
irreparable
injury.
and
so
they
--
this
court
at
that
point
introduced
into
the
picture
the
question
of
irreparable
injury
that
is
something
that
if
you
don't
give
the
relief
now,
it
won't
be
any
good
later
and
of
course
that's
--
such
a
case
like
the
glove
is.
mr.
edwin
pearce
yes
sir,
i
would.
mr.
edwin
pearce
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
yesterday
expressed
interest
in
three
areas
and
i
think
in
view
of
my
limited
time
i'd
rather
confine
myself
to
those
three
areas
that
were
mentioned
and
i
will
do
that.
the
areas
to
which
i
referred
to
a
question
of
all,
mr.
justice
brennan
expressed
an
interest
in
discussion
of
the
ledbetter
case
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
harlan
expressed
an
interest
in
the
writ
of
prohibition
as
a
remedy
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
goldberg
expressed
an
interest
in
the
possible
adjudication
through
a
contempt
procedure
of
this
area.
the
ledbetter
case
perhaps
is
best
the
starting
point
for
that,
a
case
i'm
sure
is
committed
to
the
members
of
the
court.
it
arose
out
of
alabama.
an
ex
parte
injunction
was
granted
on
application
of
the
plaintiff
without
any
hearing.
a
motion
to
dissolve
was
made
by
the
defendant
union.
the
motion
was
overruled.
the
alabama
supreme
court
affirmed
and
it
was
brought
here
by
certiorari.
and
the
court
with
a
dissent,
ruled
that
the
case
did
not
present
sufficient
finality
to
warrant
it
being
decided
by
this
court.
a
thing
or
two
about
that
case
that
i
would
like
to
mention.
it
of
course
came
at
the
time
when
the
courts
were
just
beginning
to
feel
the
impact
of
the
section
7
and
other
rights
guaranteed
by
the
taft-hartley
act
which
i
believe
was
in
1947
and
i
believe
this
case
finally
reached
this
court
in
1952.
i
suppose
it
was
a
trickle
of
new
cases
coming,
but
even
at
that
time,
the
lawyers
representing
the
unions
realized
that
the
temporary
injunctive
orders
of
the
state
courts
were
going
to
be
used,
at
least
in
many
areas,
as
an
effective
bar
to
exercise
of
these
rights
and
for
that
reason
that
case
was
brought.
it
was
the
argument
made
in
that
case
as
well
as
i
can
discern
it
from
the
opinion
is
that
the
case
would
be
moot
if
it
were
not
decided
at
that
point
and
therefore,
the
petition
would
be
without
remedy.
there
was
an
interesting
thing
said
in
that
case,
but
i'm
not
sure
what
it
means
because
i'm
not
familiar
with
alabama
procedure,
but
whatever
it
means,
it's
clearly
furnishes
a
basis
of
distinction
between
that
case
and
this
case,
the
case
at
bar.
after
stating
that
the
case
would
become
moot,
the
petition
would
be
left
without
remedy,
the
court
said,
“well,
we
don't
understand
that
to
be
a
ground
for
enlarging
our
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
finality.”
then
this
statement
was
made,
“furthermore,
the
interlocutory
decree
could
have
been
readily
converted
into
a
final
decree,
and
the
appeal
could
have
proceeded
without
question
as
to
the
jurisdiction
just
as
effectively
and
expeditiously
as
the
appeal
from
the
interlocutory
injunction
was
pursued
in
this
case.”
the
statement
i'm
interested
in
is,
“could
have
been
readily
converted
into
a
final
judgment.”
now
whether
that
refers
to
any
procedure
in
alabama
by
which
the
defendant
without
the
consent
of
the
opposite
party
could
request
and
obtain
a
conversion
of
a
temporary
order
into
a
final
judgment
or
whether
it
has
reference,
as
i
think
it
does,
to
the
more
speedy
procedure
in
alabama
to
which
i
have
been
to
some
extent
exposed
and
know
that
a
final
trial
can
be
normally
reached
there
within
perhaps
a
few
weeks.
mr.
edwin
pearce
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
pearce
i
stated
that
it
may
refer
to
that
in
alabama.
it
may
also
refer
to
the
fact
that
only
a
few
weeks
will
intervene
in
that
state
between
the
temporary
hearing
and
the
trial
here
om
merits.
it
could
easily
refer
to
either
one,
but
whichever
it
refers
to,
let
me
make
it
very
clear
that
in
georgia
that
cannot
be
done
and
if
i
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
could
not
have.
mr.
edwin
pearce
that
if
i
may
just
make
this
statement,
has
been
tried
a
number
of
times,
i
believe
in
these
cases,
these
45
cases
most
to
which
i
managed
to
lose
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
get
one
converted
into
a
permanent
injunction.
the
court
will
say,
“you
can
consent
to
a
permanent
injunction,
but
you
consent
then
to
the
injunction,
you
may
not
then
appeal
it.
i
mean,
it's
a
consent
to
the
injunction.
you
have
no
right
to
say
that
it
shall
be
considered
permanent,
although,
you
could
get
the
consent
of
the
other
party
and
never
were
able
to
get
it.”
actually,
we
asked
for
it
in
this
case
and
did
not
get
it
and
i've
asked
for
it
in
every
case
i
had,
and
did
not
get
it
and
the
georgia
procedure
will
not
permit
you
to
do
it.
mr.
edwin
pearce
that
is
impossible
in
the
georgia
procedure.
you
may
not
do
that.
short
of
consenting
to
the
injunction
itself
which
falls
into
further
complaint
about
it
or
appeal,
you
may
not
without
consent
of
the
actual
party
do
anything
to
cause
the
temporary
injunction
be
treated
as
a
permanent
injunction.
so,
whatever
that
phrase
means
in
that,
i
know
it
means
something
proper,
i
mean,
something
that
is
true,
but
whatever
it
means
either
speed
of
court
or
procedure,
we
don't
have
it
in
georgia
and
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
accomplish
that
and
we
didn't.
mr.
edwin
pearce
in
this
case,
there
was
no
request
by
me
of
the
court
to
treat
it
as
a
permanent
injunction
because
i
have
made
the
request
before
and
then
denied
and
no
authority
in
my
state
in
that
for
doing
it.
as
far
as
getting
it
tried,
it
can't
be
tried
because
under
this
system,
we
have
--
a
case
is
not
ripe
for
trial
until
it
reaches
a
certain
point
from
the
bottom
of
a
long
list
of
active
cases
and
according
to
the
certificate
of
the
clerk
that's
a
minimum
of
12
months.
we
have
no
right
to
go
in
and
say,
“this
case
should
be
taken
out
of
turn,”
that
i've
tried
without
success,
neither
of
those
things
that
i
asked
for
in
this
case
because
i
have
had
a
history
there
of
not
being
able
to
get
either
of
those
remedies.
so
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
not
on
the
trial
of
--
on
the
merits,
not
on
the
final
trial.
mr.
edwin
pearce
it
is
true
that
when
a
judge
in
our
state
issues
an
ex
parte
order
without
a
hearing
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
--
he
will
give
some
consideration
to
a
speedy
interlocutory
hearing
and
by
that,
we
may
get
in
three
to
four
or
five
weeks,
sometimes
sooner
if
the
judge
is
willing
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
do
it.
but
the
--
hearing
on
the
merits
may
not
be
pushed
forward
in
any
way
in
the
world
that
just
isn't
possible
to
do
it.
and
i
say
that
both,
as
a
matter
of
law
and
a
matter
of
actual
practice
and
attempt
to
be
there.
mr.
edwin
pearce
i
would
think
so
because
the
way
the
courts
put
it
to
you,
you
have
to
say,
“we
consent
to
the
above
and
foregoing
judgment.”
now,
the
minute
we
do
that,
we
don't
have
any
right
to
appeal,
but
they
would
let
us
say
we
consent
to
the
judgment
that
has
been
issued
being
put
in
permanent
form,”
if
they
would
let
us
do
that,
then
of
course,
i
could
travel.
mr.
edwin
pearce
no,
sir.
it's
not
limited
to
labor
cases,
no
sir.
the
plaintiff
has
a
right.
i
mean
there
maybe
this
substantial
right
the
plaintiff
may
have
in
other
types
of
cases
he
may
wish
to
wait
until
final
trial
to
put
in
whatever
he
wants
to
put
in
the
court.
in
other
words,
if
he's
willing
to
have
you
go
up
at
this
point,
he
can
consent
but
if
he
isn't
willing
there's
no
way
that
we
can
deprive
him
of
his
right
to
wait
until
calendar
time
and
try
his
case
in
due
course
on
the
merits.
i
don't
know
whether
that's
peculiar
to
georgia
or
not.
i
doubt
it
is
although
there
maybe
other
places
of
states
where
they
have
a
procedure
that
the
defendant
can
request
or
consent
that
the
injunction
in
temporary
form
being
made
permanent
without
losing
his
right
to
appeal.
that
cannot
be
done
in
georgia
nor
it
cannot
be
expedited
in
any
way,
the
permanent
hearing.
mr.
edwin
pearce
nothing
would
happen.
in
other
words
the
judge
has
signed
the
interlocutory
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
sir?
mr.
edwin
pearce
there
would
be
a
trial
12,
15,
18
months
later,
yes,
sir.
if
it
go
through
the
trial
docket,
it
wouldn't
[inaudible]
the
judge
wouldn't
make
any
entry
at
all
on
that
statement.
that,
i
would
be
glad,
i
know
this
is
a
point
of
interest
and
i
would
be
glad
to
refer
to
the
brief
then
but
our
state
to
this
court
as
a
matter
of
law
and
as
a
matter
of
practicality
in
having
them
tried,
this
can't
be
done.
you
either
--
you
can
take
your
temporary
order
up
as
we
did
in
this
case
but
you
can't
ask
that
it
be
made
permanent
unless
the
other
side
will
agree
to
it
which
the
case
then
of
course
any
order
that
you
and
the
other
lawyers
agree
to
the
court
will
make.
and
now
i'm
going
to
finish
so
i'm
going
to
hurry
a
little
bit.
now
in
that
case
the
question
of
mootness
was
made
but
it
was
at
an
early
time.
now
when
we
--
this
was
--
this
ledbetter
case
was
before
the
garmon
case
and
before
the
garner
case
and
weber
against
the
anheuser-busch,
and
the
other
cases
in
which
the
doctrine
of
preemption
was
announced
by
this
court
as
a
jurisdictional
doctrine,
that
is
that
the
field
is
preempted.
when
those
cases
came
along,
we
thought
then
this
is
our
remedy.
if
the
supreme
court
has
announced
that
the
state
court
is
without
jurisdiction
in
this
field,
certainly
the
state
courts
won't
assert
you.
and
certainly
if
they
do,
we
can
have
it
reviewed
by
the
federal
court.
it
took
us
10
years
and
i've
documented
those
10
years
to
find
out
that
two
things
for
sure
in
georgia
now
exist.
number
one,
that
the
state
court
temporary
injunction
is
a
specific
and
effective
antidote
to
the
exercise
of
section
7
powers
and
secondly,
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
will
not
pay
any
attention
to
the
preemption
doctrine.
those
are
documented
by
the
cases
in
the
brief.
those
two
things
exist.
this
case
came
along
and
it's
like
the
typical
case.
it
infringed
on
the
rights.
it
had
a
meant
--
a
mention
in
the
petition
of
a
right
--
a
violation
of
a
state
right
to
work
law.
the
evidence
showed
that
there
was
no
substantial
evidence
introduced
from
which
that
could
be
found.
the
trial
court
on
the
interlocutory
injunction
exercised
here
its
discretion
was
persuaded
but
this
case
was
so
weak
that
he
should
not
grant
a
temporary
injunction.
for
once,
we
went
in
the
trial
court,
he
said,
“the
injunction
should
not
be
granted”.
this
was
taken
after
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
they
said
the
evidence
demanded
a
finding
of
the
injunction
and
sent
it
back
and
said,
“you
must
enjoin
this
picket”,
which
is
the
strongest
case
i
could
ever
get.
in
other
words,
the
man
with
the
discretion
said,
“no
injunction”.
the
supreme
court
said,
“this
record
demands
an
injunction”.
so
now
we
brought
it
to
this
court
with
two
things
that
we
want
to
point
out
that
may
be
differ
from
the
ledbetter
case.
number
one
is
ledbetter
case
talked
about
mootness
and
talking
about
finality
as
a
practical
matter.
i
have
tried
to
demonstrate
that
in
this
area,
in
this
state,
as
a
practical
matter,
the
interlocutory
injunction
is
found
and
denies
your
rights.
and
i
also
point
out
that
if
in
alabama
as
this
court
has
said,
the
interlocutory
injunction
could
have
been
readily
converted
into
final
judgment.
the
case
at
bar
from
georgia
differs.
we
cannot
do
it.
we
are
faced
with
a
minimum
of
12
months
and
the
clerk
was
very
conservative,
he
didn't
much
like
the
idea
of
publishing
how
slow
we
were,
so
he
set
a
minimum
of
12
months
and
we'll
go
on
that.
actually,
it's
about
18
in
the
normal
case.
we
have
shown
that
that's
how
long
it
takes
to
get
one
to
the
final
calendar
and
we've
shown
that
in
every
case
in
the
last
10
years
not
one
has
ever
been
tried,
not
one,
45
cases,
i
think
i
had
33
of
them.
not
one
could
ever
be
made
to
go
in
a
final
trial.
mr.
edwin
pearce
i
say
not
one
was
ever
reached
on
the
merits.
mr.
edwin
pearce
first
of
all,
it
strikes
all
a
long
wail,
your
right
sir,
have
gone,
that's
number
one.
number
two
is
and
i
got
this
close
for
once.
i
got
it
--
i
got
me
a
picket,
and
he
stayed
out
then
we
kept
it
alive,
nurtured
it,
and
kept
it
alive,
and
incubated
it.
and
when
we
got
it
raised,
the
final
[inaudible]
came
in
and
said,
“i
dismiss”.
you
can't
stop
him,
united
states.
he
dismissed.
now,
i
got
nothing
to
appeal,
no
case
at
all.
you
can't
do
it.
it
just
can't
be
done.
if
you
--
if
we
can't
get
relief
in
the
interlocutory
hearing,
section
7
rights
are
not
existing
in
georgia.
now,
we
have
made
--
what
i
think
it's
a
very
good
departure
from
that
rule
in
pope
against
atlantic
coast
line,
that
was
a
case
in
which
a
resident
of
georgia
wanted
to
bring
a
demonstrator
against
the
railroad
under
the
federal
employees
liability
act
which
gave
him
the
right
to
bring
it
as
a
transit
action
in
georgia,
alabama.
he
brought
it
in
alabama
because
he
was
a
resident
of
georgia
and
because
i
--
the
courts
had
jurisdiction
over
his
person.
the
court
issued
an
order
--
i
mean,
didn't
issue
an
order.
they
--
well,
they
did
issue
a
temporary
order,
but
rested
on
a
petition
to
restrain
him
from
prosecuting
that
case
in
alabama
which
of
course
was
depriving
him
of
his
right
to
bring
cause
of
action
under
the
federal
employees
liability
act.
the
case
actually
came
up
and
this
came
from
georgia
and
i'm
therefore
familiar
with
the
practice.
this
came
up
on
something
that
is
about
as
[inaudible]
as
anything
we
held
there
really
on
demurrer.
the
defendant
demurred.
the
trial
court
sustained
it.
it
was
appealed
to
our
supreme
court
and
they
overruled
the
order
sustaining
the
demurrer
which
only
said,
“this
petition
states
a
cause
of
action
and
may
be
tried.”
that
was
appealed
by
the
claimant
to
this
court
as
is
on
certiorari.
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
to
protect
the
right
of
bringing
the
suit
under
the
federal
employees
liability
act
reversed
and
remanded,
and
said,
that
he
had
the
right
to
bring
the
suit
wherever
he
wanted
to.
the
important
thing
there
is
in
the
departure.
i
won't
call
your
attention
as
that
comes
up
on
demurrer
here.
all
the
demurrer
adjudicated
was
that
the
petition
with
all
of
its
allegations
that
the
claim
was
being
brought
in
alabama
for
fraudulent
and
vexatious
and
harassment
purposes
stated
a
cause
of
action.
we
don't
know
the
extent
of
the
fraud
without
any
evidence.
we
don't
know
the
extent
of
the
harassment
of
the
vexatious
nature,
but
the
georgia
supreme
court
said,
“that
sets
out
a
cause
of
action.”
this
court
said
it
does
not
and
sent
it
back.
now
we've
--
now
have
a
question
in
that
case
of
handling
a
review
on
demurrer
which
is,
as
early
as
you
can
get
in
georgia,
proposing
now
an
order
of
how
we
try
things
and
demurrer
is
the
first
thing
you
try
then
the
police
filed
in
the
case
on
[inaudible].
that
extension,
every
reason
that
came
into
that
would
be
in
our
case.
of
course
it
was
obviously
a
bad
thing.
this
man
couldn't
bring
his
case
for
the
years
it
took.
he
might
not
have
a
case.
he
might
not
have
any
witnesses.
he
might
not
have
the
money
to
last
to
bringing
the
case
there.
even
the
statute
of
limitations
might
run.
i
don't
know
what
alabama
would
say
about
a
statute
running
when
another
court
of
another
state
had
enjoined
them.
they
might
give
him
relief,
they
might
not.
so
he
was
on
a
bad
fix.
he
didn't
have
a
relief
then
and
not
at
all,
but
that's
no
different
from
the
showing
i
have
made.
we
have
to
have
relief
here
or
not
at
all.
i
ask
you
to
look
at
the
pope
case
and
i
gave
this
citation
yesterday
and
see
if
the
departure
i'm
requesting
is
anymore
adequate
than
the
departure
in
the
pope
case
or
there
--
if
any
reasons
in
the
pope
case
that
i
wouldn't
have
here.
now,
rather
quickly
because
of
the
time,
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
me
about
the
use
of
a
writ
of
prohibition.
i
think
that
is
settled
sir
by
the
case
of
amalgamated
clothing
workers
against
richman
brothers,
348
u.s.
511,
in
which
a
precise
situation
like
this
arose.
a
petition
in
the
state
court
to
enjoin
the
picketing
was
filed.
the
union
first
tried
to
remove
it
to
the
federal
court.
that
removal
was
denied
and
properly
so
by
the
federal
court
on
the
grounds
that
district
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction,
the
labor
board
did.
but
with
that
pronouncement
that
the
labor
board
had
jurisdiction,
they
then
made
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
case
in
the
state
court.
the
state
court
overruled
the
motion.
then
the
petition
was
filed
in
the
federal
court
by
the
union,
the
federal
district
court,
asking
that
the
state
case
be
prohibited
or
enjoined
and
pending
that
and
before
hearing,
the
state
court
came
out
and
granted
the
injunction.
the
district
court
refused
to
enjoin
it,
i
believe.
anyhow
it
reached
this
court
and
certiorari
was
granted
and
this
court
said
that
only
the
labor
board,
the
national
labor
relations
board,
could
bring
a
petition
in
the
federal
court
to
enjoin
the
handling
of
prosecution
of
a
state
case,
that
a
private
party
could
not
do
it.
now
there
were
three
dissents
in
that
case
and
that
case
might
be
[inaudible]
examination
that
is
348
u.s.
511,
but
it's
still
--
it
hasn't
been
touched
by
this
court
since.
it's
been
followed
by
a
number
of
circuit
courts
but
this
court
has
not,
as
far
as
i
know,
made
any
further
pronouncement
on
it.
so
this
court
has
said
that
we
cannot
do
--
take
that
right.
now,
getting
to
the
request
here,
i'm
not
going
too
fast
and
i
guess
i'm
not
going
fast
enough
if
i
[inaudible],
getting
into
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question,
he
asked
me
about
the
georgia
law
i
believe
it's
the
[inaudible]
and
hit
me
at
the
time
i
could
have
told
you
fairly
accurately
then
what
it
was,
i
do
have
it
now
with
citations
and
it
is
consistent
with
the
general
law.
we
are
very
positive
down
there
that
you
have
no
right
to
violate
an
injunction
simply
because
it's
wrong
and
may
later
be
reversed
and
they're
rather
tough
in
the
enforcement
of
that,
if
i
may
add
that.
if
however,
the
order
is
based
on
absolute
--
i
mean
if
the
order
is
without
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter,
then
it's
a
nullity,
it's
void
and
the
contempt
proceeding
will
be
reversed
upon
recognition
of
the
voidness
of
the
order.
i'm
familiar
with
the
case
of
amalgamated
railway
and
motor
coach
employees
and
united
gas
corp.
and
chemical
workers
case
against
the
wisconsin
employment
relations
board,
that's
340
u.s.
383
in
which
both
case
on
the
merits
and
the
contempts
hit
the
court
at
the
same
time
and
they
said
that
the
wisconsin
labor
board
had
no
right
to
be
operating
in
the
field
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
had
and
reversed
the
whole
thing,
lock,
stock
and
barrel,
i
suppose
the
contempts
along
with
the
case
in
maine.
there
is
one
more
case
if
you
let
me
in
my
last
minute
add
to
that
because
this
case
is
very
close
to
my
heart.
it's
a
new
case.
it
hasn't
gotten
in
the
books
yet.
it's
called
in
re
green
and
it
was
decided
in
this
court
on
may
the
21st
of
this
year,
and
it's
case
number
312,
and
it
is
reported
in
the
supreme
court
reporters
at
82
supreme
court
reporters
1114.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
lawyer
advised
the
union
to
make
a
test
case
out
of
it
was
himself
committed
to
jail
on
contempt.
and
he
tried
the
rocky
road
of
bail,
habeas
corpus,
and
finally
reached
this
court
and
got
turned
loose.
but
he
got
turned
loose
by
a
majority
on
the
grounds
that
his
constitutional
rights
to
be
heard
were
infringed
upon
because
the
judge
in
committing
him
wouldn't
even
let
him
tell
why
he
did
it.
there
was
a
strong
dissent
from
--
in
the
result
but
in
the
reason
for
the
result
by
some
members
of
this
court
who
would
i
think
have
kept
his
lawyer
in
jail
except
for
the
fact
that
he
claimed,
he
had
--
he
advised
this
contempt
after
conference
with
the
trial
judge
and
opposing
lawyer
and
all
three
of
them
agreed
it
would
be
alright
to
test
it
by
contempt.
the
judge
in
committing
him
wouldn't
let
him
make
that
statement
at
all
and
the
minority
decision
of
this
court
was
to
the
effect
that
if
you
have
an
agreement
with
the
judge
and
the
other
lawyer,
certainly
the
judge
ought
not
to
agree
that
you
can
make
a
test
case
and
then
puts
you
in
jail
for
doing
it.
mr.
edwin
pearce
let
me
put
it
this
way,
sir.
i
suppose
there
are
obvious
facts.
first
of
all
if
we
would
advise
our
clients
to
do
something
that
a
lawyer
maybe
--
would
be
slowed
to
do
particularly
in
georgia
where
the
courts
have
no
patience
with
it,
don't'
want
it
done,
and
will
file
a
pretty
heavy
penalty
if
you
try
to
do
it.
then
assuming
you're
always
faced
with
a
parti
--
with
a
case
where
you
have
put
a
little
something
about
state
law
in
there
even
though
they're
not
going
to
prove
it.
now,
you've
got
to
risk
the
thing.
that's
the
--
the
court
won't
decide
there's
a
little
bit
of
state
jurisdiction
here
and
therefore
he
isn't
quite
without
jurisdiction.
you've
got
to
expose
yourself
to
a
jail
sentence
and
the
consequent
perhaps
it
will
also
--
statute
in
your
community
that
you
achieved
by
such
proceedings.
and
maybe
the
lawyer
together
with
his
clients
get
under
rather
heavy
sentences
and
all
come
up
by
certiorari.
now,
by
way
at
home
were
not
quite
agreed
on
how
to
pronounce
the
word
‘certiorari
granted'.
we
all
agree
that
perhaps
the
sweetest
words
in
the
english
language
in
such
a
situation
by
your
clients
and
yourself
or
have
a
jail
sentence
would
be
those
two
words
but
like
all
sweet
things
they
come
with
not
frequency
and
without
certainty.
and
i
would
say
this,
that
the
whole
policy,
the
national
labor
relations
act
being
to
adjudicate
and
stabilize
labor
relations
as
much
as
possible
than
to
suggest
that
to
obtain
a
review
of
the
law
to
be
done
by
the
torturous,
perilous
and
rocky
route
of
violating
and
advising
a
client
to
violate
the
order
intentionally
and
hoping
that
we
will
get
out
at
this
court.
we
couldn't
get
out
of
georgia
because
georgia
has
already
said
they
had
jurisdictions.
we
know
where
we'd
be
in
our
state
and
our
sole
threat
would
be
come
to
this
court
and
say,
“would
you
grant
certiorari?”
and
that
i
don't
believe
would
be
--
certainly
--
and
another
thing,
suppose
we
did
that
and
we
got
an
adjudication,
it
wouldn't
help
the
section
7
rights
at
all
in
that
case,
would
the
georgia
courts
pay
any
attention
to
it?
they
have
the
garmon
case.
they
have
the
weber
case.
they
don't
pay
attention
to
those.
mr.
edwin
pearce
well
--
yes,
sir.
it's
not
dead
yet,
there's
still
work
going
on.
it's
within
what
is
called
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
oh,
yes.
we
have
it
--
we
--
oh,
let
me
make
one
more
statement
for
that
--
i
would
like
this
to
be
in
the
record
if
there
is
such
a
thing.
i
noticed
in
the
pope
case,
it
was
stated
that
the
petitioner
freely
agreed
that
he
had
no
other
defenses
that
this
federal
defense
will
not
have
acted
upon
it.
we
readily
agree
to
the
same
thing.
we
have
no
other
defense
in
the
permanent
trial.
the
georgia
court
has
already
said
that
the
record
we
have
here
and
we
would
--
couldn't
make
a
less
record
is
enough
to
demand
the
verdict
so
it
wouldn't
mean
we
got
a
jury
issue.
the
court
would
have
to
direct
a
verdict
because
the
supreme
court
has
said
it's
demanded.
so,
we
have
no
defense
at
all
except
this.
this
federal
question
is
raised
here.
it's
been
passed
upon
finally
by
the
highest
court
of
our
state.
it
would
be
contemptuous
under
our
statute
for
a
lawyer
to
re-raise
this
point
in
the
georgia
state
court
because
the
question
of
jurisdiction
has
been
submitted
to
the
court
and
passed
upon.
we
can't
raise
it
again.
so
this
federal
question
cannot
be
re-raised.
there
is
no
other
question
in
the
case
and
it
has
that
aspect
of
finality
more
so
by
far
than
the
pope
case
says.
mr.
edwin
pearce
the
remittitur
went
down
and
the
court
passed
an
order
making
the
order
of
the
supreme
court,
the
order
of
(voice

--
mr.
edwin
pearce
sir,
i
didn't
hear
that.
mr.
edwin
pearce
the
--
i
see
that
the
--
that
--
this
is
the
judgment.
now,
the
remit
--
the
gentleman
give
them
that,
we
do
have
it
here.
mr.
edwin
pearce
yes
sir.
the
trial
court
said
this
--
only
considering
they
were
then
remitted
to
it,
this
order
and
adjudged
back
to
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
be
made
the
judgment
of
this
court
and
that
the
same
would
be
entered
on
the
minutes.
that
is
a
malpractice
for
the
injunction.
mr.
edwin
pearce
you'd
--
you're
not
entitled
to.
in
other
words,
just
a
--
the
court
accepts
the
directions
of
the
supreme
court
(voice

--
mr.
edwin
pearce
that
the
order
of
the
--
yes,
we
must
have
appeared
because
--
here,
let
me
read
it
again.
this
case
came
before
this
court
upon
a
writ
of
error
from
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county
and
after
argument
had,
it
is
considered
and
adjudged
no
way
with
that
sale.
upon
considering
the
then
remittitur
is
ordered
and
adjudged
that
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
be
made
the
judgment
of
this
court
and
that
the
same
be
entered
on
the
merits
--
on
the
minutes
signed
by
the
superior
court
judge.
mr.
edwin
pearce
well,
this
was
the
29th
of
january,
1962
which
was
the
injunction
following
the
decision
of
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
they
--
this
is
on
procedures.
the
[inaudible]
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
presented
it
back,
and
say,
“you
issue
the
injunction”.
mr.
edwin
pearce
yes,
sir.
i
don't
believe
it's
in
your
printed
record
because
of
course
we
will
appeal
it
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
yes,
sir.
that
is
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
pearce
the
petition
sets
out
exactly
what
injunction
he
wants.
the
supreme
court
said,
it
was
demanded
that
he
have
that
relief.
the
superior
court
judge
said,
the
supreme
court
judgment
is
made,
the
judgment
of
this
court
and
entered
on
the
minutes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
well,
all
i
can
say
--
i
would
like
to
have
this
made
available
to
this
court,
all
of
it.
mr.
edwin
pearce
that
in
our
practice
is
an
injunction
because
he
doesn't
just
accept
the
mandate.
he
says,
it's
made
the
order
of
the
court
entered
on
the
minutes.
mr.
edwin
pearce
that's
his
order.
mr.
edwin
pearce
it
isn't
required,
no,
sir.
mr.
edwin
pearce
i
know
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
i'm
not
unaware
what's
puzzling
the
court
which
is
an
injunction
should
be
specific
and
you
would
think
the
judge
would
issue
another
order.
all
i'm
saying,
is
they
don't.
this
is
the
way
they
do
it.
mr.
edwin
pearce
i
don't
think
we
have
a
right
to.
i
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
i
say
we
didn't.
i
don't
think
mr.
patton
did,
no,
sir.
in
other
words,
when
the
supreme
court
said
that
under
this
interlocutory
hearing
a
--
an
injunction
as
requested
was
demanded
then
all
that
remains
to
be
done
by
the
judge
is
not
to
have
another
hearing,
no
more
evidence,
no
reexamination
of
it
but
just
say
okay
the
supreme
court
said
under
the
evidence
in
the
hearing
we've
already
had,
an
injunction
as
requested
was
demanded.
so,
the
supreme
court
said
that
is
demanded
so
the
trial
court
just
enters
it
on
the
minutes
as
the
injunction.
mr.
edwin
pearce
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
pearce
yes,
sir,
that
is
the
injunction.
let
me
say
this,
the
petition
always
contains
and
is
required
to
contain
under
our
practice
the
specifics
of
the
injunction
requested
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
--
not
just
some
injunction
or
an
injunction
as
the
court
may
direct.
mr.
edwin
pearce
yes,
sir.
then,
well
--
paragraph
b,
yes
sir.
then
the
judge,
if
he
wants
to
grant
an
ex
parte,
he
doesn't
repeat
that.
he
says,
this
injunction
is
granted
to
this
party,
that's
the
way
an
ex
parte
injunction
is
issued.
and
the
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
it
was
just
a
written
judgment
denying
the
injunction
and
orally
stating
perhaps
the
grounds
but
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
i
think
two
things.
i
think
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
mr.
patton
tried
the
case
and
choose
to
not
–-
mr.
edwin
pearce
it
was
--
did
not
show
a
violation
of
the
state
right
to
work
the
law.
that
was
our
obvious
argument.
of
course,
the
evidence
really
didn't
show
it.
mr.
edwin
pearce
i
don't
care
particularly
to
rebut
but
i
would
like
to
ask
the
court
if
the
court
would
like
to
have
available
to
it
the
remittitur
and
the
trial
judge
order
on
the
remittitur
which
we've
been
discussing.
if
so
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
(voice
overlap)
--
handed
in
to
the
clerk
--
mr.
edwin
pearce
the
only
copy
i
have
has
some
self-serving
notes
with
--
i
believe
i
would
like
to
copy
it
without
those
notes.
mr.
edwin
pearce
thank
you
sir.
