can
you
tell
me,
are
you
going
to
ask
us
to
overrule
ledbetter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
could
govern
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
have
that
again
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh
yes
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
pearce,
i
recall
in
my
own
practice
in
new
jersey
in
situations
of
this
kind,
it
was
possible
for
the
defendant
to
consent
the
entry
of
a
permanent
injunction
on
the
record
on
which
the
temporary
order
had
issued
and
that's
the
way
we
used
to
avoid
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
you
think
that
has
reference
[inaudible]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
defendant
could
not
for
example
in
this
instance
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
could
not
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
practice
i
--
i
was
familiar
with
was
not
of
consenting
to
the
permanent
injunction
only
to
assenting,
if
you
please,
to
the
entry
of
a
permanent
injunction
on
the
record
on
which
the
--
that
temporary
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
is
that
the
injunction
mr.
pearce?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
couldn't
anyone
know
what
he's
in
--
sustain
from
doing
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
terms
mr.
pearce,
i
meant
--
how
does
one
know
[inaudible]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
from
doing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
did
you
appear
in
court
or
didn't
you?
i
didn't
quite
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
mean
this
mr.
pearce,
i'm
looking
at
page
38,
the
[inaudible]
--
in
the
record.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(b)
the
defendant
and
all
persons
acting
in
association
in
connection
with
defendant
be
restrained
and
enjoined
from
picketing
or
causing
the
picketing
of
the
construction
job
of
the
petitioner,
etcetera.
is
that
then
and
under
your
practice,
does
that
constitute
now
the
injunction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
seems
to
be
only
paragraph
b,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
you
should
have
gone
back
in?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
langstaff,
if
i
may
just
before
you
begin.
if
you
had
submitted
a
formal
restraining
order,
would
that
have
been
in
the
language
of
paragraph
b
at
page
38?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
would
it
have
been
precisely
that
--
in
other
words,
all
that's
missing
i
gather
is
that
this
very
language
was
not
incorporated
in
the
form
of
an
injunctive
order
which
judge
forrest
signed,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
otherwise,
this
is
precisely
what
you
would
have
submitted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
judge
was
not
under
an
obligation
automatically
to
issue
the
injunction
without
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
langstaff,
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
the
--
if
it
there's
merit
in
this
preemption
point
and
the
preemption
goes
to
jurisdiction,
what
remains
to
be
done
in
the
georgia
courts
on
that
issue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
does
that
go
to
the
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
go
to
jurisdiction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
was
addressed
just
to
the
--
on
the
preemption
jury
â€“-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
jurisdiction
of
the
georgia
courts
to
do
anything
in
the
way
of
issuing
injunctive
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
to
test
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
--
was
not
prohibited
or
protected,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
it
arguably
prohibited
or
arguably
permitted.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
suppose
that's
not
--
that's
not
controlling
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see
if
i
get
this
clearly
mr.
langstaff.
are
you
agreeing
in
your
colloquy
with
mr.
justice
black
that
if
the
determination
whether
this
picketing
was
protected
activity
or
not,
depends
upon
whether
the
contract
is
violated
that
the
decision
whether
it
was
violated,
is
one
that
the
board
might
properly
make?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
in
fact
there
was
a
violation
of
this
contract,
would
you
agree
that
the
picketing
then
was
protected
activity?
