mr.
pearce,
i
believe
you
were
arguing,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
injunctions
have
priority
on
the
calendar
in
your
state?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
merits.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren

what
--
i
didn't
get
your
last
sentence.
chief
justice
earl

yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
you
may.
mr.
langstaff.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
any
injunction
or
not
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
there
ever
been
an
injunction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
argued
into
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
that's
in
your
brief,
you
argued
it
in
your
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
you
seek
such
a
--
such
an
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
legal
effect
of
the
order
that's
under
review
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
before
you
get
to
that,
you
haven't
yet
told
us
what
the
legal
effect
of
the
--
of
this
order
under
review
is,
that
is
the
order
of
the
trial
court
after
the
remittitur
came
down,
what
is
the
legal
effect
if
any
of
that
order?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
and
then
it
came
back
to
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
says
that
the
decision
of
the
court
--
supreme
court
is
the
order
of
this
court,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
take
that
--
just
take
that
last
sentence
over
of
this,
you
--
as
you
read
it
and
see
what
that
says?
take
that
last
little
paragraph.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
now,
what
is
the
legal
effect
of
that?
what
is
it
--
what
does
this
meaning?
what
does
it
purport
to
do
if
it
doesn't
--
if
it
doesn't
purport
to
grant
the
injunction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
pearce,
i
think
you
have
a
couple
of
minutes
more.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
--
you
may
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
leave
it
with
the
clerk.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
and
mr.
langstaff,
if
you
have
anything
you
wish
to
add
to
that,
you
may
do
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
take
it
as
you've
presented
here
as
long
as
you
agree.
