mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
before
i
turn
to
my
main
argument,
i
would
like
to
clear
up
the
confusion
about
the
architect's
fees
and
how
that
transaction
might
have
been
conducted.
it
is
true
mr.
justice
white
that
the
--
had
they
paid
the
--
contributed
money
to
pay
the
architects
&
builders
fees,
ultimately
the
proceeds
and
the
stock
sale
would
have
been
the
same.
the
difference
is
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
the
difference
is,
the
gain
would
be
different.
the
proceeds
are
the
same,
but
they
would
have
a
different
basis.
they
would
have
already
realized
$400,000
of
ordinary
income
and
that
would
become
the
basis
in
their
stock
and
so,
the
gain
on
the
sale
of
the
stock
would
have
been
different.
also,
the
suggestion
on
the
same
point
was
made
that
to
pay
themselves
they
would
have
had
to
contribute
the
money;
that
was
not
the
arrangement.
what
they
assured
the
fha
was,
not
that
they
wouldn't
pay
themselves
for
their
architects
&
builders
services,
they
would
pay
themselves
by
means
other
than
cash,
namely
they
would
give
themselves
stock
in
payment
of
the
architectural
and
building
services.
had
they
done
that,
the
stock
would
have
been
taxable
compensation,
that
they
had
to
pay
themselves
for
their
services
of
construction
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
financial
problems
of
raising
cash.
they
don't
have
to
pay
themselves
cash.
now,
i
would
like
to
start
i
think
is
always
useful
to
start
in
a
tax
case
with
the
statute
to
see
what
we
can
learn
about
the
problem
from
the
statute
itself.
it's
at
page
39
of
the
government's
brief.
this
is
the
statute
by
the
way,
in
the
form
it's
stood
during
the
transactions
in
question,
it's
been
changed
later,
but
i
would
talk
about
it
as
it
then
stood.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
was
amended
first
in
1951
and
in
the
54
code
made
substantial
changes
and
the
relative
amendments,
i
hope
to
get
to
those,
but
paragraph
one
says
that
the
gain
from
the
sale
or
exchange
or
the
liquidation
of
a
collapsible
corporation
should
be
taxed
as
ordinary
income.
paragraph
2a
defined
a
collapsible
corporation.
it
is
defined
as
a
corporation
which
is
formed
or
availed
of
principally
for
the
manufacture,
construction
or
production
of
property
with
a
view
to
the
sale
or
exchange
of
the
stock
by
the
stockholders
or
the
liquidation
of
the
corporation
prior
to
the
realization
by
the
corporation
of
a
substantial
part
of
the
net
income
to
be
derived
from
the
property
and
by
that
means
the
realization
by
the
stockholders
directly
through
the
stock
sale
of
gain
attributable
to
such
property.
now
first,
i
would
like
to
note
that
statute
applies
only
to
a
certain
kind
of
corporations,
corporations
that
are
engaged
in
the
manufacture,
construction
or
production
of
property
and
that
to
me
says
a
great
deal
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
it
is
limited
to
corporations
engaged
in
creative
processes,
production,
manufacture
or
construction
or
processes
by
which
value
is
created
and
so,
its
concern
is
with
the
way
in
which
the
values
created
by
those
processes
is
realized
and
taxed.
what
it
is
concerned
with
is
attempts
by
stockholders
to
realize
upon
those
values
directly
before
the
corporation
has
realized
and
then
taxed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
question
is
now
conceded,
but
there
is
no
doubt
there
was
--
well,
there
was
never
any
doubt
that
was
availed
principally
for
construction.
there
was
a
dispute
at
one
time
whether
they
had
the
view
during
construction
to
quick
sale
of
the
stock,
that
is
now
closed,
that's
the
question
that
was
foreclosed
by
the
limitation
of
this
grant
of
cert.
we
are
now
concerned
only
with
the
question
of
whether
a
claim
that
the
gain
would
have
been
capital
gain,
have
they
done
it
as
individuals
bears
upon
the
application
of
section
117(m).
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
might
say
in
response
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
that
we
do
not
concede,
we
definitely
do
not
concede,
but
have
they
done
this
as
individuals
it
would
have
been
capital
gain.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that
would
be
our
contention.
the
exceptions
from
the
capital
gains
definition
is
for
property
held
primarily
for
sales
for
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
trader
business.
now,
what
it
really
comes
down
to
this
whether
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
anticipation
that
the
quality
of
anticipation
of
sale
is
different
for
purposes
of
117(m)
and
for
purposes
of
that
definition
of
capital
assets.
we
would
argue
that
it
isn't,
and
that
in
fact
if
during
construction
or
you
are
building
it,
you're
engaged
in
the
business
of
building
property,
you
contemplate
a
sale,
as
at
least
one
of
the
possible
alternative
ways
of
realizing
the
value
of
your
construction
profits
that
it
is
not
a
capital
asset.
but
you
do
not
have
to
decide
that
question,
we
have
not
argued
in
our
brief
other
than
to
note
its
existence
in
the
foot
note.
i
think
it's
on
page
30.
we
suggest
that
if
that
should
ever
become
relevant,
proper
course
would
be
to
remand
it
to
the
tax
court
to
consider
that
question.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
it
is
not.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no
sir,
it
is
not,
it's
not.
we
do
not
consider
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right.
if
so,
i
would
agree
and
i'll
show
that
there
might
be
anomaly
and
perhaps
that
difference
shouldn't
exist,
but
that
doesn't
tell
us
which
result
is
the
wrong
one,
and
i
would
think
that
the
individual
case
would
be
the
unintended
loophole
and
not
what
congress
specifically
tried
to
foreclose
in
117(m).
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right
the
state
--
the
question
presented,
the
assumption
state
of
question
we're
now
talking
about
is
that
it
would
be
capital
gain,
had
they
done
it
as
individuals.
i'm
perfectly
prepared
arguendo
to
make
that
assumption
orders
the
deal
with
the
specific
question
before
the
court,
that's
not
the
same
as
a
concession
that
in
fact
that
is
true.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
no
for
purposes
of
the
decision
in
this
court,
but
i'd
suggest
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
i
think
the
same
assumption
would
carry
over
to
the
corporation.
the
statute
directed
to
corporation
is
used
to
produce
or
create
property
with
a
view
by
the
stockholders
to
realize
on
those
values
by
a
stock
sale
or
liquidation
of
the
corporation
before
the
corporation
has
realized
on
it.
now,
the
definition
uses
the
phrase
with
a
view
of
their
stock
sale,
with
a
view
to
realizing
gain
attributable
to
the
property.
now,
i'd
like
to
first
go
and
show
whether
their
argument
is
pitched
on
that
phrase,
but
the
phrase
appears
later
on
the
statute,
i
want
to
cover
that
and
then
come
back
to
the
phrase.
paragraph
three
has
limitations
on
the
application
of
paragraph
one
and
it
provides
--
well,
there
are
three
limitations,
very
briefly.
the
first
one
which
isn't
important
here
is,
you
have
to
own
more
than
10%
of
the
stock
and
the
third
one
limits
these
application
to
realization
of
gains
on
property
within
three
years
after
completion
of
the
property,
which
likewise
is
not
involved
here,
but
here
is
explanation
i
would
suppose
why
the
other
corporations
avoided
this
provision.
the
one
we're
concerned
with
is
b,
now
that
provides
in
the
case
of
a
gain
realized
by
a
shareholder
upon
his
stock
in
a
collapsible
corporation,
this
subsection
should
not
apply
to
the
gain
recognized
during
taxable
year,
unless
more
than
70%
of
such
gain
is
attributable
to
the
property
so
manufactured
constructed
or
produced.
now
the
relationship
of
that
reference
to
the
gain
being
the
attributable
property
and
that
in
the
definition
is
simply
that
between
they're
anticipating
the
gain
and
their
actual
realization.
the
latter
provision
talks
about
their
actual
realization,
they
in
fact
have
to
realize
gain
which
is
at
least
70%
attributable
to
the
property
that
was
constructed.
now
their
argument
--
first
of
all,
the
phrase
gain
attributable
to
the
property
admittedly
performs
the
function
of
confining
this
to
gain
that
was
caused
or
generated
by
the
construction
or
creation
of
the
property.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that,
it
serves
that
function,
distinguishes
gain
that
was
so
generated
from
gain
that
was
created
by
various
other
factors,
purchased
property
or
in
the
case
of
manufacturing
corporation
simply
the
enhancement
of
value
of
its
fixed
assets
or
the
existence
of
an
antitrust
claim,
anything
at
all
is
distinguished
by
that
phrase.
and
that
phrase
limits
the
statute
to
the
gain,
which
is
specifically
attributable
to
the
created
property,
the
property
constructed,
manufactured
or
produced.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
principally,
principally,
he
may
have
other
activities
and
a
manufacturing
incorporation
would
also
have
fixed
assets.
if
the
gain
were
attributable
to
enhancement
of
the
value
of
a
manufacturing
company's
fixed
assets
simply
because
of
a
change
in
the
character
of
the
neighborhood
comes
a
better
site,
the
gains
attributable
to
that
would
not
be
the
kind
of
gain
that
tax
--
that's
taxed.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
the
gain
of
the
stock,
which
reflects
that
added
asset
value
in
the
corporation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
a
difficult
question,
i
think
the
regulations
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
regulations
would
say
that
the
created
property,
we
don't
break
it
down
into
what
caused
the
created
property
to
be
worth
the
increased
value,
whether
the
creation
process
or
a
subsequent
change
of
market
values
and
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
that's
quite
right,
quite
right,
and
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
that's
right,
that's
right,
and
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right,
right.
no
i
would
think
that
it
would
be
fruitless
to
even
to
attempt
to
distinguish
the
value
of
the
produced
property,
the
manufactured
property
attributable
to
changes
in
market
values
and
to
the
process
of
creation.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
policy
would
really
want
to
make
that
distinction
in
terms
of
inventory
items,
but
that
isn't
our
problem
here
nor
i
would
like
to
address
that.
now,
what
they
say
is
that
the
word
gain
also
serves
another
function.
it
doesn't
simply
identify
the
source,
the
causal
relationships,
but
is
meant
to
limit
the
application
of
the
statute
to
a
certain
kind
of
gain,
one
that
reflects
a
converted
ordinary
income.
now
first
i
would
like
to
point
out,
that
the
statutes
cannot
be
read
that
way.
and
starting
with
paragraph
one,
which
speaks
of
the
gain
in
the
sale
or
exchange
of
stock
clearly
refers
simply
to
the
excess
of
the
proceeds
over
basis,
simply
the
quantum
of
profit
nothing
else,
nothing
is
about
its
character.
and
the
provision,
we're
just
looking
at
page
3b
starts
out
that
in
case
of
the
gain
realized
by
a
stockholder,
i.e.
on
the
sale
of
exchange
of
a
stock,
again
that
gain
is
necessarily
to
the
excess
of
proceeds
over
basis.
the
subsection
are
applied
to
the
gain
recognized
during
the
--
unless
more
than
70%
of
such
gain
is
attributable
to
the
property.
now
the
gain
there
necessarily
is
a
reference
to
the
gain
otherwise
used
in
the
same
sentence
to
mean
simply
the
excess
of
proceeds
over
basis
and
they
refer
only
to
the
fraction
of
that
gain,
which
is
attributable
to
the
property.
so
you
cannot
read
into
gain
any
qualification
about
the
kind
of
gain
that
it
represents.
now
more
than
that,
i
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
--
and
even
more
serious
problem
with
their
suggested
method
of
construing
the
statute.
they
would
have
you
believe
that
it's
not
you
simply
substituted
for
the
word
gain
something
like
converted
ordinary
income
that
is
not
enough.
a
great
deal
of
baggage
would
have
to
go
with
that
to
spell
out
the
test
by
which
you
decide
whether
a
particular
gain
is
a
conversion
of
ordinary
income.
now
for
one
thing,
i
think
in
their
brief
they
seem
to
acknowledge
that
it
wouldn't
be
enough
simply
to
ask
whether
the
corporation
would
have
had
capital
gain
had
it
sold
the
property.
we've
referred
that
occasionally,
but
generally
to
the
emphasis
on
the
stockholders
and
the
reason
the
emphasis
is
on
the
stockholders
is
that
at
least
one
of
the
purpose
is
admittedly
was
to
prevent
stockholders
who
were
themselves
dealers
in
property
from
avoiding
ordinary
income
treatment
by
putting
each
transaction
into
separate
corporate
shell.
and,
so
necessarily
it
is
not
enough
simply
to
look
to
how
the
corporation
would
treat
the
gain
had
it
sold
the
property.
so,
you
have
to
go
back
and
see
how
the
stockholders
would
have
treated
it.
now
the
question
as
to
each
stockholder
i
take
it
would
be,
if
he
had
held
the
property
would
he
have
held
it
as
primarily
for
sale
in
the
ordinary
course
of
traded
business.
now,
there
is
no
more
litigated
question
in
the
tax
field
when
you
hold
property
in
the
ordinary
course
of
trader
business
hold
it
for
sale.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
that's
right
but
there,
i'm
assuming
that
you
would
answer
that
question
to
hold
that
it
would
be
capital
gain.
i'm
assuming
that
would
be
the
answer,
but
i
would
still
like
to
point
to
the
complexity
of
the
question,
that
you
make
the
application
of
this
statute
turn
upon.
now
simply
stating
a
hypothetical
question
that
you
are
going
to
answer
is
enough
of
an
undertaking,
but
i'd
like
to
emphasize
particularly
two
further
specific
different
problems
that
would
be
faced.
first
of
all,
all
the
stockholders
need
not
to
be
in
the
same
status,
some
of
them
might
be
dealers
and
others
not.
now
in
this
case
all
three
stockholders
have
always
joined
together
in
all
their
ventures
so
they
all
can
be
viewed
as
one,
but
that
would
not
always
be
true.
so
what
would
you
do?
would
you
have
a
separate
treatment
for
the
individual
stockholder
depending
upon
his
status
or
would
you
say
that
if
anyone
of
the
stockholders
was
a
dealer,
the
part
would
be
tainted
for
all
the
stockholders?
now
when
congress
granted
this
kind
of
relief
in
1958
what
it
did
is
it
acknowledged
this
problem
and
said
that
if
any
stockholder
owning
more
than
20%
was
a
dealer
or
trader
when
the
corporation
is
collapsible
as
to
all
stockholders.
it
did
not
grant
individualized
treatment,
as
to
--
if
there
was
a
20%
stockholder
in
that
category.
for
the
second
problem
of
the
same
kind
is
what
do
you
do
in
making
that,
cited
in
that
hypothetical
question
about
other
corporate
ventures
that
the
stockholders
have
engaged
in
of
the
same
type.
you
cannot
ignore
them
because
that
would
permit
a
dealer
to
avoid
it
simply
by
incorporating
all
of
his
ventures.
now
again
the
1958
amendments,
when
they
granted
this
relief
dealt
with
that
problem
and
provide
very
complex
formula
how
you
take
into
account
in
deciding
how
property
would
have
been
characterized
in
the
hands
of
an
individual
stockholder
that
stockholders,
other
corporate
ventures.
very
briefly
if
he
is
a
20%
stockholder
in
this
corporation,
in
the
other
corporation
within
the
--
during
which
--
in
which
he
held
more
than
20%
of
the
stock
during
the
past
three
years
and
the
assets
of
which
are
the
same
kind
you
treat
as
though
he
conducted
individually,
but
necessarily
you
would
have
to
deal
with
that
problem
to
articulate
the
test
that
the
petitioners
ask.
so
i
do
not
believe
that
even
if
there
were
mirror
to
their
underlying
argument
on
policy
that
it
would
be
possible
to
read
the
statute
the
way
they
want
you
to
read
it,
but
i
do
want
to
deal
with
the
questions
of
policies
that
they
say
are
involved,
specifically
to
show
that
this
case
does
involve
a
conversion
of
ordinary
income.
i've
shown
that
the
statute
by
its
terms
is
limited
to
corporations
engaged
in
construction,
manufacturing
or
production
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
make
the
policy
judgment
that
the
fruits
of
productive
activity
should
be
taxed
as
ordinary
income
to
have
a
full
explanation
of
the
statute
as
concerned
only
with
conversions
of
ordinary
income.
but
this
case
in
particular
shows
i
think
an
extreme
example
of
how
we
do
covert
ordinary
income
through
construction
efforts.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
is
an
illustrative
argument
that
you
don't
need
to
rewrite
the
statute
to
confine
it
to
its
proper
scope
and
to
limit
it
to
foreclosing
conversions
of
ordinary
income.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
no
--
i
use
a
different
reference
to
decide
whether
its
conversion
of
ordinary
income,
it
depends
upon
the
sense
in
which
you
define
that
phrase.
he
would
ask
you
to
look
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right
and
i
think
this
is
illustrative
of
all
cases
that
will
fall
within
this
category.
it's
simply
that,
he
insinuates
in
the
phrase
conversion
of
ordinary
income,
a
very
specific
reference
to
how
stockholders
would
be
taxed
if
they've
done
it
individually.
and
when
i
say
conversion
of
ordinary
income,
i
don't
mean
that.
i
mean
a
conversion
of
underlying
elements
of
the
gain
that
were
generated
by
personnel
services.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry,
you
did
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
i
think
it
would,
i
think
all
the
gain
here
actually
was
really
attributable
to
the
construction
efforts.
they
[inaudible]
about
$700,000
not
simply
the
architect's
fees
and
builder's
fees,
but
the
subcontracting
services
they
performed.
i'd
like
to
go
through
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes.
actually
they
entered
contracts.
they
entered
paper
contracts
with
the
corporation
to
perform
the
construction
work
for
$700,000
more
than
they
ultimately
charged.
and
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
the
charge
the
price
that
the
contracts
called
for
and
every
bit
of
their
gain
would
have
been
taxed
to
them
as
construction
profits.
in
answer
to
you
mr.
justice
harlan,
we
go
onto
consider
the
underlying
nature
of
the
transaction,
although
it
is
never
entirely
satisfactory
to
stop
simply
with
the
words
of
the
statute.
we
would
like
to
show
that
the
statute
does
not
produce
absurd
results.
now
in
this
case,
the
--
i
will
use
the
figures
related
only
to
the
springfield
corporation,
both
corporations
are
identical
really.
the
federal
housing
administration
in
agreeing
to
guarantee
the
mortgage
loan,
estimated
that
the
total
cost
of
construction,
i
will
exclude
the
carrying
charges
and
the
finance
charges
and
deal
with
the
construction
costs,
would
be
$4.5
million.
that's
the
estimated
reproduction
cost
of
this
project;
that
included
$4,100,000
of
cost
to
the
builder,
the
direct
construction
cost,
plus
$400,000
of
builder's
fees
and
architect's
fees.
now
the
three
petitioners
formed
a
construction
partnership
to
perform
the
construction
work.
the
partnership
entered
into
paper
contracts
with
the
corporation
calling
for
payment
of
$4,100,000
in
cash,
that's
the
direct
construction
cost,
plus
$200,000
of
builder's
fees
in
the
form
of
stock,
not
in
cash
and
an
architectural
contract
called
for
the
payment
of
$200,000
of
architect's
fees
in
stock,
not
in
cash.
in
fact
they
were
never
intended
to
be
performed.
i
take
it
they
were
window
dressing
having
something
to
do
with
the
financing
aspects
of
the
case.
the
work
was
–
they
waived
the
architect's
fees,
the
builder's
fees,
they
waived
their
right
to
$4,100,000
in
cash
and
performed
the
contract
at
their
direct
out
of
pocket
cost,
which
turned
out
to
be
$3,800,000,
that
is
to
say,
$300,000
less
than
the
estimated
direct
cost
apart
from
the
architect's
and
builder's
fees.
now
those
additional
savings
were
attributable
to
fact
that
the
estimates
assume
that
they
would
use
subcontractors
to
perform
the
work.
in
fact
the
partnership
performed
itself
the
carpentry
and
plumbing
and
heating
work
without
using
subcontractors
and
thereby
eliminated
also
the
subcontractors
market.
that's
the
main
source
of
the
additional
savings.
well
whatever
the
source
of
the
savings
that
normally
the
construction
company
would
realize
and
not
the
owner
of
the
building.
now
by
that
means
they
ended
up,
the
corporation
ended
up
with
a
building
with
a
estimated
reproduction
cost
and
presumably
value
of
$4.5
million
for
which
it
had
to
pay
only
$3,800,000,
that
is
to
say
$700,000
less,
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
a
year
later
the
stockholders
were
able
to
dispose
of
their
stock
for
an
amount
closely
approximating
that
$683,000.
now
the
way
they
actually
disposed
of
the
stock,
the
buyer
insisted
that
they
drain
off
from
the
corporation
all
of
its
cash
first
so
that
they
would
have
to
pay
less.
so
the
corporation
first
wrote
up
the
value
of
the
buildings
by
$750,000
to
create
a
capital
surplus.
out
of
the
capital
surplus
they
then
distributed
to
the
stockholders
$410,000.
the
stockholders
then
turned
their
stock
over
to
the
buyers
for
an
additional
$273,000
so
they
netted
in
the
end
$683,000.
now
we
agree
that
for
purposes
of
this
case,
the
distribution
to
the
corporation
can
basically
be
ignored
and
would
be
the
same
question,
if
they
had
simply
sold
it
to
the
buyers
for
$683,000.
now,
i
might
suggest
that
what
their
gain
represented,
what
generated
their
gain
was
simply
the
uncompensated
services,
that
they
contributed
to
the
corporation
in
constructing
the
building
by
not
charging
for
their
services,
they
were
able
to
create
an
equity
in
the
corporation
worth
$700,000
and
they
cashed
in
on
that
equity
by
selling
the
stock,
and
i
say
that
is
precisely
the
kind
of
thing
that
section
117(m),
is
designed
to
prevent.
now
they
say
that
isn't
the
purpose,
they
don't
really
deny
that,
that
element
is
involved,
but
they
say
well
we
could
have
gotten
away
with
that
had
we
done
it
as
individuals
and
that
wasn't
therefore
the
purpose
of
117(m).
i
think
the
history
shows
that
117(m)
was
not
focused
simply
upon
the
alternative
ways
that
they
might
have
done
it
and
to
prevent
them
doing
something
by
corporations
they
couldn't
have
done
without
it,
but
rather
was
focused
upon
the
basic
nature
of
the
transaction
and
how
it
should
be
taxed.
i
think
that's
demonstrated
by
the
movie
example
that
prompted
the
statute.
now
in
the
movie
case
mr.
eisenstein
has
told
you
that
if
an
individual
producer
produced
a
movie
and
leased
it,
he
would
have
received
ordinary
income,
well
that's
quite
right,
an
individual
builder
built
a
house
and
leased
that
he
would
receive
ordinary
income.
he
doesn't
tell
you
what
would
happen
if
the
individual
producer
made
the
movie
purportedly
for
purposes
of
leasing,
but
then
sold
it
and
that
producer
would
have
exactly
the
same
argument,
i'm
not
saying
that
he
would
win,
would
have
exactly
the
same
argument
for
capital
gains
treatment
on
his
sale,
that
these
stockholders
would
have
on
their
sale
individually
of
the
buildings.
so
the
movie
case
is
an
exact
parallel,
at
least
prior
to
the
1950
act.
now
in
1950
act
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
another
change
was
also
made
at
the
statute,
which
accepted
from
the
capital
assets
definition
copyrights
and
artistic
works
in
the
hand
of
the
person
whose
personal
efforts
created.
maybe
we
acknowledge
that,
that
might
reach
movies
in
the
hands
of
an
individual
producer
after
1950.
my
first
answer
is
that
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
congress
when
it
was
looking
to
117(m)
related
its
judgment
there
to
what
was
going
on
in
its
amendment
to
the
other
section.
and
in
fact
they
never
brought
together
in
their
development.
president's
message
just
talks
about
the
movie
problem,
the
hearing
they
weren't
brought
together,
and
the
capital
asset
definition
exclusion
doesn't
refer
to
movies,
the
history
doesn't
refer
to
movies.
there
are
serious
problems
in
bringing
movies
within
that
category.
this
revenue
ruling,
in
1955
that
a
movie
produced
by
a
corporation
is
not
within
that
exception,
because
it
wasn't
produced
by
the
corporation's
personal
efforts,
but
more
than
that
it
took
the
combined
efforts
of
a
large
number
of
people,
and
a
large
investment,
quite
different
from
the
writings
of
both.
i
would
also
say
that
these
two
provisions
were
responses
to
very
different
inducements.
what
prompted
the
amendment
to
the
capital
asset
definition
was
the
eisenhower
ruling,
ruling
in
1958
that
eisenhower's
book
then
general
eisenhower,
“crusade
in
europe,”
his
proceeds
from
some
of
that
received
ordinary
--
received
capital
gains
treatment.
now
i
myself
had
questioned
ruling,
but
what
congress
did
in
this
provision
was
to
describe
all
of
these
things
as
loopholes.
it
doesn't
detract
at
all
from
our
notion
that
the
products
of
personal
efforts
ought
to
be
taxed
as
ordinary
income
and
something
that
allowed
them
to
be
taxed
otherwise
is
a
loophole,
they
were
described
as
loopholes
in
the
history
of
that
provision.
granted
they
didn't
deal
with
the
problem
of
builders
constructing
property
with
the
personal
efforts
and
then
selling
the
property,
but
that's
because
i
don't
believe
there
was
anything
to
bring
that
to
congress's
attention,
they
were
all
done
through
corporations.
over
that
finally
that
the
difference
between
a
corporation
and
an
individual,
if
there
is
a
difference
in
the
tax
treatment
and
i
don't
agree
--
i
don't
admit
that
there
is,
isn't
entirely
a
fortuitous
in
it's
application,
because
most
of
these
things
when
they
are
done
in
large
sizes
can
in
fact
only
be
done
through
corporations,
and
do
a
great
deal
more
through
corporation
than
you
can
in
individual
assets.
that
doesn't
deny
that
there
is
still
some
anomaly,
if
we
can't
correlate
the
treatment
in
the
two
cases
and
i
would
think
one
should
strive
to
correlate
them,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
there
is
nothing
of
substance
to
the
distinction.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
correct.
the
petitioners
i
should
say
point
out
that
prior
to
the
adoption
of
regulations
they
found
three
rulings
that
they
said
private
rulings
are
inconsistent.
actually
we
--
private
rulings,
i
suggest
simply
are
not
authoritative
of
anything,
and
in
fact
those
were
not
cleared
with
the
chief
counsel's
office,
when
it
was
cleared
they
stopped
granting
them,
and
they
didn't
grant
them
to
other
units
of
the
same
builders.
