mr.
louis
eisenstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
income
tax
case,
which
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
there
are
three
tax
payers
involved
and
the
taxable
year
is
1950.
the
asserted
deficiencies
come
to
about
$500,000.
the
resolution
of
the
dispute
before
the
court
turns
on
the
meaning
and
application
of
section
117(m)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1939.
section
117(m)
deals
with
tax
avoidance
through
so
called
collapsible
corporations.
this
avoidance
consists
of
realizing
the
everyday
ordinary
income
from
property
as
a
capital
gain
through
the
device
of
incorporation
and
a
disposition
of
stock.
in
other
words,
the
device
is
designed
to
take
unfair
advantage,
as
president
truman
put
it,
of
the
difference
between
the
ordinary
income
tax
rates
and
the
capital
gain
rate.
i
will
now
briefly
summarize
the
relevant
facts,
which
i
gather
are
not
in
dispute,
and
then
i
will
turn
to
the
statute.
the
three
tax
payers
are
benjamin
braunstein,
benjamin
neisloss,
and
harry
neisloss.
for
many
years
starting
in
1919,
the
neisloss’s
and
then
the
neisloss’s
and
braunstein
were
engaged
in
holding
and
managing
investments
in
real
estate.
in
the
1920’s,
the
neisloss’s
through
corporation
acquired
an
improved
commercial
properties,
and
they
also
purchased
parcels
of
land
for
development.
then
between
1930
and
1948,
the
neisloss’s
and
then
the
neisloss’s
and
braunstein
built,
held,
and
operated
multiple
dwelling
apartments
and
commercial
properties
all
through
corporations.
in
every
case,
the
stock
as
well
as
the
underlying
property
was
held
as
a
long-term
investment.
in
a
number
of
instances
the
holdings
were
retained
for
as
long
as
nine,
ten,
and
15
years.
five
of
the
projects
were
multiple
dwelling
developments
financed
under
section
608
of
the
national
housing
act.
now
this
case
involves
another
fha
rental
development.
in
march
1948,
the
taxpayers
organized
two
corporations
to
build
and
operate
a
development
known
as
oakland
gardens.
each
taxpayer
owned
a
third
of
the
common
stock
in
each
corporation.
construction
started
in
april,
1948
and
the
buildings
were
completed
and
ready
for
occupancy
between
september
1948
and
june
1949.
in
may
1950,
the
taxpayers
were
approached
by
brokers
on
behalf
of
certain
prospective
purchasers.
in
june
1950,
the
taxpayers
agreed
to
sell
their
stock
and
the
sale
was
eventually
consummated
through
a
sale
of
stock
in
november
1950.
after
the
sale,
the
taxpayers
remained
active
in
the
construction
and
operation
of
rental
properties
held
as
long-term
investments.
they
continued
to
own
and
operate
four
fha
developments,
which
had
been
built
before
oakland
gardens.
they
built
a
shopping
center,
a
number
of
stores,
and
a
large
apartment
house,
and
they
also
remodeled
apartments
all
as
a
source
of
rental
income.
they
have
never
held
rental
property
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
it
is
clear,
if
they
had
owned
the
development
as
individuals
their
profit
on
its
disposition
would
have
clearly
been
a
capital
gain
and
it
is
equally
clear
that
the
corporations
did
not
hold
the
development
for
sale.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
we
notice
that
in
its
brief
in
the
supreme
court
the
government
has
suggested
that
if
we
are
right
on
the
main
issues
then
case
should
be
remanded
and
i
would
gather
that
they
mean
a
remanding
with
respect
to
this
point.
but
the
court
of
appeals
below
very
clearly
assumed
that
the
taxpayers
would
have
been
entitled
to
capital
gain
treatment
if
they
had
held
the
development
as
individuals.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
whole
opinion
otherwise
is
an
academic
exercise.
in
short,
the
incorporation
of
the
enterprise
and
the
sale
of
stock
did
not
enable
the
taxpayers
to
convert
ordinary
income
into
capital
gain.
each
tax
payer
reported
his
profit
on
the
sale
as
a
long-term
capital
gain.
the
commissioner
determined
that
the
profit
was
taxable
as
ordinary
income
under
section
117(m).
judge
kern,
the
trial
judge
dissented,
i
regret
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
judgment
of
the
tax
court.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
they
had
only
paid
capital
gains
tax
and
the
government
has
never
questioned
the
payment.
there
has
been
no
assertion
of
deficiency
with
respect
to
the
other
developments.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
well,
i
think
there
are
two
explanations
that
can
be
given
and
i'm
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
one
explanation
is
that
the
government
regarded
them
as
bona
fide
capital
gain
dispositions.
secondly,
117(m)
does
not
apply
if
the
sale
of
stock
occurs
more
than
three
years
after
construction
is
completed,
and
it
maybe
that
in
some
of
the
other
developments
that
is
why
the
government
did
not
pursue
its
present
tax.
this
court
granted
certiorari
limited
to
the
question
whether
section
117(m)
applies
where
the
stockholders
would
have
been
entitled
to
capital
gain
treatment
if
they
had
conducted
the
enterprise
as
individuals
instead
of
through
a
corporation
and
i
should
add
that
the
question
is
so
limited
is
the
question
as
it
was
precisely
phrased
by
the
government
for
the
consideration
of
this
court.
the
fifth
circuit
has
resolved
the
same
question
in
favor
of
the
taxpayer
in
the
ivey
case,
in
an
opinion
by
judge
wisdom
concurred
in
by
judges
reeves
and
cameron.
on
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
commissioner
agreed
that
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
this
case
and
the
ivey
case
that
the
two
cases
are
squarely
in
conflict.
i
now
turn
to
the
statute,
section
117(m)
which
the
commissioner
would
apply
here.
this
statute
is
a
segment
of
a
comprehensive
legislative
scheme
on
capital
gains.
it
creates
a
special
exception
to
the
general
long
settled
rule
that
a
sale
of
stock
is
a
conversion
of
a
capital
asset
subject
to
the
distinctive
treatment
of
capital
gains.
it
provides
that
profit
realized
on
a
sale
or
exchange
of
stock
in
a
collapsible
corporation
is
taxable
as
ordinary
income
rather
than
capital
gain.
a
collapsible
corporation
is
a
very
special
kind
of
entity
defined
in
paragraph
two
of
the
statute.
it
is
a
corporation
formed
or
availed
off
principally
for
the
construction
of
property
with
a
view
to
achieving
two
particular
objectives.
the
first
result
that
must
be
intended
is
the
shareholders
sale
or
exchange
of
stock
in
the
corporation
before
the
corporation
itself
realizes
a
substantial
part
of
the
net
income
to
be
derived
from
the
property.
the
second
result
that
must
be
intended
is
the
shareholders
realization
now,
“gain
attributable
to
such
property.”
the
question
in
this
case
comes
down
to
this.
a
collapsible
corporation
is
a
corporation
used
principally
for
constructing
property
with
a
view
to
the
shareholder's
realization
of
gain
attributable
to
such
property
before
the
corporation
itself
realizes
a
substantial
part
of
the
net
income
to
be
derived
from
the
property.
was
the
profit
realized
by
the
taxpayers
on
the
sale
of
their
stock
gain
attributable
to
such
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
it
is
our
position
that
the
profit
realized
here
was
not
the
gain
contemplated
by
the
statute.
we
contend
that
gain
attributable
to
the
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
is
gain
which
would
be
ordinary
income
from
the
property
if
the
stockholders
as
individuals
or
the
corporations
had
realized
it
in
a
normal
course
of
business.
here
the
profit
would
have
clearly
been
a
capital
gain,
not
ordinary
income,
if
the
taxpayers
had
directly
owned
and
sold
the
development
or
if
the
corporation
itself
had
sold
it.
there
was
no
conversion
of
ordinary
income
here
to
incorporation
and
a
sale
of
stock.
now
the
court
of
appeals
fully
agreed
with
us
in
that
there
was
no
such
avoidance
here.
however,
it
then
went
on
to
hold
that
the
critical
language,
“gain
attributable
to
such
property”
means
any
kind
of
profit
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
profit
and
its
relation
to
the
enterprise.
this
interpretation
is
directly
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
congress
as
fully
illuminated
and
spelled
out
by
the
legislative
history.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
frankly
indicated
that
its
conclusion
is
not
in
accord
with
the
stated
purpose
and
policy
of
congress.
as
the
legislative
history
plainly
shows,
this
statute
is
solely
concerned
with
profit
which
is
a
conversion
of
ordinary
income
from
the
property
into
capital
gain
through
the
deliberate
use
of
a
corporation
of
that
purpose.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
the
movie
situation
was
one
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
construction
industry
was
another
and
i'm
about
to
come
to
that.
i
have
indicated
that
the
statute
is
solely
concerned
with
gain
which
is
a
conversion
of
ordinary
income.
that
is
why
the
definition
of
a
collapsible
corporation
is
specifically
geared
to
whether
or
not
the
corporation
itself
has
realized
a
substantial
part
of
the
net
income
from
the
property
before
the
sale
of
the
stock,
and
that
is
why
the
definition
is
also
geared
to
the
specific
purpose
or
motive
which
prompted
the
stockholders
to
construct
the
property.
as
the
expensive
legislative
history
shows,
before
1950,
various
taxpayers
in
the
movie
industry
and
the
construction
industry
were
converting
ordinary
income
into
capital
gain
through
the
calculated
abuse
of
the
corporate
forum.
for
example,
if
motion
picture
producer
made
a
movie
as
an
individual
and
rented
the
picture
under
the
usual
arrangement,
his
rental
income
was
taxable
as
ordinary
income.
if
he
did
the
same
through
a
corporation,
the
rental
income
was
also
taxable
as
ordinary
income.
in
order
to
avoid
such
unpleasant
results,
a
producer
would
setup
a
corporation
to
make
a
film.
upon
completing
the
film,
he
would
liquidate
the
corporation
and
distribute
the
film
to
himself.
he
would
report
the
difference
between
the
cost
of
his
stock
and
the
value
of
the
film
as
a
long-term
capital
gain.
he
would
then
license
the
film
as
the
corporation
would
have
done
and
amortize
the
reported
value
of
the
film
against
the
rental
income.
in
this
way,
the
usual
ordinary
income
from
the
property,
that
is
the
rental
income,
was
converted
into
capital
gain.
the
same
kind
of
practice
developed
in
the
construction
industry
where
houses
were
built
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
if
a
builder
constructed
and
sold
the
houses
himself,
the
profit
on
the
sale
was
ordinary
income.
if
he
made
the
sale
through
a
corporation,
the
profit
was
also
ordinary
income.
builders
would
convert
this
ordinary
income
into
capital
gain
in
one
of
two
ways;
they
would
sell
the
stock
in
the
corporation
or
they
would
liquidate
the
corporation,
report
a
capital
gain
based
on
the
difference
between
the
cost
of
their
stock
and
the
value
of
the
houses
and
then
sell
the
houses
at
the
same
price.
in
either
case,
the
content
of
the
gain
was
profit
normally
realized
as
ordinary
income.
congress
enacted
section
117(m)
to
tax
all
such
converted
income
from
the
constructed
property
in
terms
of
its
true
economic
content
as
ordinary
income.
the
gain
attributable
to
the
property
with
which
the
statute
is
concerned
is
such
converted
ordinary
income.
that
is
why
the
statute
treats
the
corporation
as
a
mere
contrivance
to
avoid
tax,
and
that
is
why
it
treats
the
stockholder's
profit
as
the
ordinary
income
it
essentially
is.
the
tax
payer
in
this
way
is
prevented
from
avoiding
the
tax
that
he
should
otherwise
pay
and
rightfully
pay.
here
as
i
have
said,
we
do
not
have
any
such
situation.
the
profit
was
not
a
contrived
substitute
for
ordinary
income
from
the
property.
the
government
has
not
been
deprived
of
any
revenue
to
which
it
would
otherwise
be
entitled.
in
short,
it
is
our
position
that
a
statute
which
is
directed
against
avoidance
should
be
carefully
confined
to
those
against
whom
it
was
directed.
it
should
not
be
applied
indiscriminately
as
if
it
were
a
massacre.
indeed
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
here
the
treasury
is
even
better
off
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
if
the
taxpayers
had
built
and
owned
the
property
as
individuals,
because
if
they
had
done
that
then
the
assets
would
have
been
sold
directly
to
the
purchaser
and
the
purchaser
would
have
used
as
his
basis
for
depreciation,
his
higher
cost,
which
was
not
available
to
the
purchaser
here,
because
a
corporation
continued
to
own
the
development.
i
should
add
that
the
commissioner
fully
agrees
with
our
understanding
of
congress'
purpose
and
then
he
pays
no
attention
to
what
he
says.
he
fully
agrees
that
the
admitted
and
“basic
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
prevent
the
conversion
of
ordinary
income
into
capital
gain,”
and
he
emphasizes,
“that
statutory
language
should
be
read,
indeed
even
strained
to
some
degree
to
avoid
absurd
results
to
carry
out
the
discovered
purposes
of
congress
and
in
general
in
an
effort
to
produce
a
rational,
sensible
structure.”
but
having
said
all
this,
he
nevertheless
argues,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
statute
applies
regardless
of
whether
the
taxpayers
realize
the
gain
contemplated
by
congress
or
regardless
to
put
in
another
way
of
whether
the
result
is
absurd.
however,
even
the
commissioner
is
unhappy
with
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
and
so,
he
has
tried
to
remedy
the
situation
by
arguing
that
any
gain
realized
on
a
sale
of
constructed
property
as
distinguished
from
purchased
property
is
ordinary
income.
we
cannot
say
frankly,
we
have
studied
the
commissioners
brief,
we
cannot
say
how
the
commissioner
came
to
this
conclusion.
it
seems
to
be
a
well
kept
secret.
however,
even
the
commissioner
finally
realizes
that
this
strange
argument
will
not
do.
therefore
in
the
end,
all
he
can
say
is
that
the
statute
taxes
a
gain
as
ordinary
income
whether
or
not
it
is
a
contrived
conversion
of
ordinary
income.
we
say
that
what
the
government
has
done
is
to
make
a
travesty
of
the
statute.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
well,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
argument.
that
argument
of
course
was
not
made
by
the
court
of
appeals,
which
was
fully
aware
of
all
these
facts,
because
they
are
set
forth
in
the
opinion.
the
commissioner's
argument
in
that
area
is
this;
he
argues
that
the
proceeds
realized
on
a
sale
of
the
stock
represent
a
conversion
of
ordinary
income
attributable
to
their
services
to
the
corporations.
as
he
puts
it,
by
waiving
the
compensation
for
their
services,
the
taxpayers
were
able
to
realize
an
amount
over
and
above
the
cost
of
the
development
and
a
mortgage
indebtedness,
that's
pretty
much
his
language.
now
this
is
a
brand
new
argument,
which
has
suddenly
shown
up
here
for
the
first
time,
it
has
never
been
made
before
and
i
should
add
that
after
he
makes
the
argument,
he
dismisses
it
and
says
it
is
unessential
and
then
he
goes
onto
summarize
what
he
considers
is
essential.
now
in
making
this
new
argument,
the
commissioner
overlooks
a
good
many
things,
which
are
in
the
record,
as
well
as
things
in
the
legislative
history.
in
the
first
place,
section
117(m)
is
concerned
with
a
conversion
of
ordinary
income
from
the
constructed
property
not
with
the
adequacy
of
compensation
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
paid
to
stockholders
while
the
hearings
indicate,
that
is
the
congressional
hearings
indicate
that
at
times
actors
were
receiving
stock
in
collapsible
corporations
as
compensation
for
their
services,
it
is
merely
noted
as
an
incidental
byproduct.
in
other
words,
they
were
being
wrung
in
on
what
is
otherwise
a
collapsible
corporation.
that
does
not
relate
however
to
the
nature
of
a
collapsible
corporation
itself,
which
is
the
conversion
of
ordinary
income
from
the
property.
the
statute
itself,
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
is
expressly
geared
to
the
corporation's
failure
to
realize
the
net
income
from
the
property.
at
any
rate,
i
want
to
add
here
no
stock
was
received
as
compensation
as
is
true
in
the
actor's
case
and
moreover
the
tax
avoidance
of
actors
has
been
separately
dealt
with
in
section
117(a)(1)(c)
which
was
enacted
at
the
very
same
time
that
the
collapsible
statute
was
enacted.
the
next
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
this;
in
any
event
the
corporations
did
not
enable
the
taxpayers
to
avoid
taxes
that
would
otherwise
have
been
due
with
respect
to
their
services.
if
the
taxpayers
as
individuals
construct
rental
property,
the
profit
realized
on
a
later
sale
is
a
capital
gain.
it
is
completely
immaterial
that
the
success
of
the
enterprise
maybe
largely
due
to
their
personal
efforts.
congress
has
made
only
one
exception
to
that
rule
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
the
rule
that
came
in
when
the
collapsible
statute
was
enacted
and
that
one
exception
relates
to
sales
of
copyrights,
artistic
compositions
and
similar
property
and
even
the
proceeds
realized
on
a
sale
of
such
assets
are
not
taxed
as
compensation.
they
are
taxed
as
the
proceeds
of
a
sale
of
property.
the
next
point
overlooked
by
the
commissioner
is
this;
that
the
proceeds
realized
on
a
sale
of
property
are
not
determined
by
the
services
that
happen
to
be
contributed
to
the
property
or
the
value
of
those
services
or
how
much
has
been
paid.
the
amount
received
depends
on
market
conditions
at
a
particular
time,
which
fluctuate
from
time
to
time.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
the
cost
of
the
building
would
have
been
higher.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
if
there
had
been
compensation
paid
to
the
corporation,
that
is
correct,
but
i
say
again
if
they
had
built
the
houses
as
individuals
and
contributed
the
same
services,
the
gain
realized
would
have
been
a
capital
gain.
and
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
the
use
of
the
corporation
did
not
enable
them
to
realize
a
capital
gain,
which
they
would
not
otherwise
have
realized
in
constructing
this
development
as
individuals,
but
there
is
also
something
else
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
this
connection.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
that
is
the
test
as
we
understand
it
whether
or
not
the
use
of
a
corporation
and
a
sale
of
stock
enables
you
to
realize
what
you
would
otherwise
realize
as
ordinary
income
as
capital
gain.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
well
there
is
--
mr.
louis
eisenstein
i
think
mr.
justice
that
you
are
mistaken.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
that
we
as
the
examples
given
in
the
committee
reports,
for
example,
with
respect
to
the
motion
picture
industry,
point
out
that
if
a
producer
made
a
picture
as
an
individual,
he
would
get
ordinary
income
from
the
property.
there
is
not
the
least
concern
with
whether
or
not
he
has
paid
for
his
services.
then
they
go
on
to
indicate
that
if
he
did
the
same
through
a
corporation,
the
rental
income
from
the
property
would
be
taxed
as
ordinary
income,
and
that
is
the
tax
that
he
is
trying
to
avoid,
but
i'm
willing
to
accept
the
justice's
premise
for
the
moment
because
even
on
that
premise,
even
on
that
premise
the
government
has
overlooked
something.
the
commissioner
has
completely
misunderstood
the
waiver
of
the
builder's
and
architect's
fees
under
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
fha.
the
proceeds
realized
on
the
sale
would
have
been
exactly
the
same
even
if
they
had
not
waived
the
fees.
they
could
not
charge
themselves
or
pay
themselves
for
their
services
unless
they
paid
themselves
out
of
their
own
moneys.
in
other
words,
in
order
for
them
to
pay
themselves
the
builder's
and
architect's
fees,
they
had
to
contribute
$600,000
to
pay
to
themselves,
and
if
they
had
done
that
the
proceeds
realized
on
the
sale
of
the
development
would
have
been
exactly
the
same.
now
what
the
commissioner
is
complaining
about
is
that
they
didn't
convert
their
own
capital
into
compensation,
which
is
a
totally
different
thing.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
if
they
had
paid
him
$600,000
to
pay
themselves,
the
result
would
have
been
exactly
the
same
as
it
is
here.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
i'm
not
entirely
clear
as
to
who
they
are.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
oh,
they
received
out
--
mr.
louis
eisenstein
we
are
including
it
because
both
parties
have
agreed
that,
that
is
part
of
the
sale
and
that
is
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
handled
the
matter.
the
550
--
mr.
louis
eisenstein
because
they
would
have
--
mr.
louis
eisenstein
and
that
would
have
been
paid
out
to
them.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
no
there
was
an
intervening
event.
they
operated
the
development
and
the
moneys
that
accrued
within
the
corporation,
were
moneys
that
accrued
through
deprecation
deductions
offset
against
the
rental
income
and
also
deductions
of
other
costs
of
constructing
a
development
which
are
permitted
to
be
deducted
against
operating
income.
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
builder's
and
architect's
fees.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
the
fha
mortgage
would
have
been
exactly
the
same
amount
but
they
would
--
mr.
louis
eisenstein
no,
i
think
one
has
to
go
one
step
further.
they
would
have
had
to
deposit,
they
would
actually
have
had
to
raise
$600,000
of
their
own,
to
put
into
the
corporation
and
then
pay
themselves.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
they
would
still
have
had
the
same
--
mr.
louis
eisenstein
well
actually
it
was
more
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
say
it
was
410,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
the
--
mr.
louis
eisenstein
they
paid
to
themselves
555.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
that
is
correct,
yes.
i
notice
that
my
time
is
pretty
much
up
and
with
the
court's
permission
i
would
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
no,
i
couldn't
go
that
far,
if
they
kept
it
a
year,
it
wouldn't
be
enough.
the
answer
to
your
question
your
honor
would
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
income
realized
before
the
sale
was
a
substantial
part
of
the
net
income
to
be
realized
from
the
property
and
i
have
no
doubt
the
commissioner's
position
would
be
that
realizing
only
one
year's
income
would
not
be
a
substantial
amount
of
income
and
therefore
assuming
that
your
motive
is
otherwise
present,
they
would
treat
it
as
a
collapsible
corporation.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
time
is
an
element.
if
what
is
otherwise
being
converted,
we
say
is
ordinary
income,
but
as
i
understood
your
question
mr.
justice,
i
assume
that
the
property
was
not
held
for
sale
to
customers
and
in
that
case
even
if
they
had
built
it
as
individuals
and
assuming
they
hadn't
held
it
for
sale
to
customers,
they
could
have
sold
it
and
realized
the
capital
gain
and
the
corporation
could
have
done
the
same
thing.
mr.
louis
eisenstein
with
the
court's
indulgence
at
--
time
at
my
disposal,
i
would
merely
like
to
address
myself
to
two
or
three
questions.
the
argument
has
been
made
that
gain
attributable
to
self
constructed
property,
that
is
where
you
put
your
own
talents
and
efforts
into
property,
and
constructing
it
is
inherently
ordinary
income,
and
that
is
not
the
law.
and
there
are
number
of
cases
cited
in
our
brief
which
have
held
over
and
over
again
that
whether
or
not
constructed
property
is
rise
to
ordinary
income
or
capital
gain
depends
upon
the
purpose
for
which
the
property
is
held.
secondly
in
1950
at
the
very
time
when
117(m)
was
enacted,
congress
enacted
117(a)(1)(c),
which
specifically
deals
with
a
certain
kind
of
property
to
which
personal
efforts
are
devoted.
and
the
committee
report
that
time
very
clearly
indicated
that
if
you
don't
fall
within
that
specific
provision
then
the
gain
that
you
otherwise
realize
on
the
sale
of
your
property
gets
capital
gain
treatment
if
it
otherwise
qualifies,
regardless
of
how
significant
your
services
were.
they
specifically
give
an
example
of
a
photographic
studio,
and
it's
well
settled
in
the
light
of
the
1950
act
that
the
invention
of
a
patent,
which
reflects
the
most
unique
ability
that
an
individual
can
bring
to
property
gives
rise
to
capital
gain
if
it
is
not
held
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
there
is
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make,
and
that
is,
that
an
impression
seems
to
have
been
left
by
the
government
that
because
you
have
some
intention
to
sell
property
if
a
purchaser
comes
along,
therefore
you
are
holding
it
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
there
again
that
is
not
correct.
there
is
a
difference
between
selling
rental
property
and
actually
actively
being
engaged
in
holding
property
for
sale
to
customers.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
this
particular
case
the
evidence
clearly
indicates
that
no
rental
property
was
held
for
sale
and
it
is
specifically
stipulated
that
the
stock
in
this
particular
case
was
not
held
for
sale
to
customers
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
