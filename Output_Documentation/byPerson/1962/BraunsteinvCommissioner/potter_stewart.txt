the
government
agree
with
you
on
both
of
those,
you
mentioned?
justice
potter
stewart
commissioner
makes
an
additional
argument,
does
he
not,
that
many
personal
services
were
contributed
free
to
the
construction
of
this
apartment
building,
and
had
they
been
compensated
that
would
have
clearly
been
ordinary
income
and
that
the
increment
in
the
value
reflected
the
fact
that
they
were
not
compensated
and
therefore
this
--
that
in
this
very
case
ordinary
income
has
attempted
to
be
converted
into
capital
gain.
that
argument
is
made;
whether
it's
good
or
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
certainly,
certainly,
if
the
services
had
been
compensated,
the
cost
of
the
building
would
have
been
higher?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
compensation
to
the
individuals
would
have
been
ordinary
income?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that's
not
–
that's
not
the
test
though.
that's
not
the
test
of
117(m),
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
what
the
corporation
would
have
realized
as
ordinary
income?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
then
capitalized,
the
future
income
is
capitalized,
but
it's
not
what
the
individuals
had
they
not
incorporated
it
would
have
realized
as
ordinary
income,
is
it
or
am
i
mistaken?
justice
potter
stewart
i
might
well
be.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
i
should
think
if
that
second
question
is
foreclosed
and
if
it's
now
--
if
we
now
take
it
as
assumed
that
the
corporation
which
had
been
formed
was
avail
of
with
the
view
to
the
prompt
sale,
then
that
would
have
been
almost
necessarily
as
sale
in
the
ordinary
course.
justice
potter
stewart
is
a
little
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
didn't
they
–
didn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
our
grant
of
certiorari
are
limited
grant
assume
that
this
would
have
been
capital
gains.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
way
we
limited
the
grant
of
certiorari
we
assume
so?
justice
potter
stewart
i
still
don't
quite
get
your
thought
as
to
what
that
means?
is
that
--
the
statute
is
confined
to
a
corporation
which
produces
or
creates
property?
justice
potter
stewart
the
gain
of
the
stock
in
the
corporation.
justice
potter
stewart
well
how
about
a
rise
in
the
market
value,
just
because
of
market
conditions.
justice
potter
stewart
all
of
the
property
created
or
produced
--
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
because
i
don't
--
justice
potter
stewart
market
value
itself
will
be
a
reflection
of
capitalization
of
future
earnings.
