[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
far
was
odessa
from
san
antonio?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
was
the
man
far
away?
i
was
just
trying
to
find
out
and
understand
and
i
don't
quite
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
away
on
his
automobile
or
how
it'd
be
away?
did
he
go
in
an
automobile
for
a
trip?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
he
sell?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
he
get
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
and
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
have
to
select
the
jury
recess?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
court
recess
after
selecting
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
--
and
they
came
back
from
lunch.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
they
left,
the
case
was
ready
for
trial
so
as
you
said?
how
have
they
been
selected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
select
the
jury
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
went
out
for
lunch.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
when
they
came
back,
the
first
thing
the
judge
said
to
mr.
tinsman
was
that
he's
going
to
discharge
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
did
the
defendant
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
after
the
tenth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
have
to
admit
that
these
came
back
from
lunch
and
simply
announced.
i
don't
know
that
that
would
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
they
did
agree
to
continue
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
first
sentence
the
judge
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
he
came
back?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
had
anything
besides
the
record
upon
which
we
can
rely?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
what
was
the
first
thing
he
said
when
they
got
back?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
that's
on
page
10?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
first
question
asked
by
mr.
tinsman
after
that
indicates
that
you
knew
nothing
about
it,
did
you?
he
says,
“is
it
permissible
to
tell
me
who
the
government's
key
witness
is?”
and
they
told
him.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
quite
right
to
say
from
this
record
that
if
he's
barred
for
being
tried
even
once,
even
on
these
counts,
the
record
shows
that
he
was
pretty
close
by
when
they
[inaudible].
the
record
also
shows
that
the
judge
put
the
case
off
because
he
didn't
want
to
try
it.
they
tried
twice,
he
said
and
the
court,
he
could
have
kept
the
jury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
the
jury
put
under
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
was
wrong
with
the
waiting
the
day
after
today?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
he
have
to
postpone
the
other
people's
right
to
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
witnesses
were
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
did
it
take
to
try
the
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
100
witnesses?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i
see.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
he
have
to
do
that
if
in
fact
the
circumstances
are
there
and
i
think
that
this
court
is
there
already,
there's
no
rigid
rule
either
way
or
there
shouldn't
be.
justice
hugo
l.
black
before
you
look
at
the
circumstance,
but
the
circums
--
the
rule
is
that
unless
there
are
grave
things
occur
which
makes
it
absolutely
necessary
to
postpone.
after
you
have
selected
a
jury
that
shall
not
be
done,
but
you
will
not
just
discharge
it.
and
added
to
that,
when
you
say
there's
no
prejudice,
i
suppose
every
lawyer
knows
there
is
a
distinct
chance
of
prejudice
when
you
change
your
view.
many
lawyers
have
dismissed
that
just
to
keep
the
main
part
before
a
separate
jury
in
civil
cases.
how
can
you
assume
that
there's
no
prejudice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
you
couldn't
prove
that
--
when
you
get
to
talking
about
what
a
jury
will
decide,
but
you
just
couldn't
prove
it.
you
couldn't
prove
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
burden
would
be
on
the
government
where
it
gets
a
--
where
it
--
after
a
case
jury
is
selected
that
that
is
ready,
the
government
said,
“i
want
to
continue”,
wouldn't
the
burden
be
on
the
government
on
those
cases
for
it
to
show
that
there
were
sufficient
circumstances
to
justify
that.
maybe
they
do
here.
i'm
not
talking
about
that,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
way
of
defense
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
not
the
burden
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
validity
of
it,
but
the
validity
depends
on
the
circumstances
on
what
to
prove
upon,
and
i
would
think
if
that
if
the
government
is
going
to
have
a
case
passed
after
the
jury
is
going
to
select
it
under
all
the
trial
cases,
it
would
be
the
government's
view
just
to
show
these
circumstances
sufficient
to
justify.
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
they
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
not
on
review.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
[inaudible]
in
that
courtroom.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
guess
you
would
say
that
the
defendant
usually
had
the
right
to
have
the
decision
made
when
he
is
present.
but
something
in
the
preference
of
proper
for
the
prosecuting
defendant
to
go
to
see
him
and
tell
him
that
i
want
to
present
that
to
you
when
we
get
back.
there's
quite
a
difference
in
that,
isn't
it,
than
just
the
judge
coming
in
and
say,
“i'll
continue
the
case”?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
other
--
only
if
the
defendant
only
asked
him
to
come
up
permitted
to
ask
who
the
witness
is,
he's
not
going
to
be
here.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
the
way
the
judge
had
quite
noticed
--
but
the
way
that
the
circumstances
i
know
of
which
it
occurred.
the
whole
action,
all
the
circums
--
maybe
you're
right
in
that
the
circumstances
don't
make
it
out,
but
that
is
certainly
a
circumstance,
isn't
it?
the
defendant
usually
--
somehow
might
have
a
decision
whether
they're
going
to
be
tried,
particularly
after
the
jury
has
been
selected.
the
decision
is
supposed
to
be
made
in
open
court
after
the
facts
are
presented
for
all
kind
of
opportunity
to
contest.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
didn't
have
to.
he
didn't
have
to,
that
he
walked
out
a
free
man.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
statement
about
such
an
absurd
result
is
kind
of
a
prejudgment,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
didn't
in
wade
versus
hunter,
did
it,
the
fact
that
they
gone
and
urged
the
witnesses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
can
tell
that
you
consider
the
circumstances
to
see
whether
there
is
sufficient
to
justify
charges
of
the
jury
of
discontinuing
the
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
telling
me
a
little
more
about
the
jury.
i
haven't
gotten
that
straight.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
jurors
were
in
the
panel
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
judges
whether
they're
trying
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
that
the
judge
was
trying
another
case
at
the
time
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
both
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
other
jury
was
released?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
jury
was
released?
justice
hugo
l.
black
while
he
went
ahead
and
tried
another
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
he
did
postpone
the
trial
of
your
case
while
he
was
trying
another
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
did
he
do
that.
why
did
he
select
the
jury
in
your
case
before
he
was
ready?
justice
hugo
l.
black
leave
him
waiting
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that's
what
happened
here?
so
he
did
let
the
jury
go
back
to
the
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
year,
under
that
practice,
he
could
just
simply
let
your
jury
go
home
for
the
rest
of
the
day
until
they
could
find
that
man
and
finally
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
according
to
the
practice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
fact,
you
did
pretty
well.
[laughter]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
did
very
well.
