mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
this
honorable
court.
in
1949,
mr.
justice
black,
speaking
for
a
majority
of
this
court
in
wade
against
hunter
had
this
to
say
with
respect
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
it
does
not
mean
that
every
time
a
defendant
is
put
to
trial
before
a
competent
tribunal,
he
is
entitled
to
go
free
if
the
trial
fails
to
end
in
a
judgment.
such
a
rule
would
create
an
insuperable
obstacle
to
the
administration
of
justice
in
many
cases
in
which
there
is
no
semblance,
the
type
of
oppressive
practices
at
which
the
double
jeopardy
prohibition
is
aimed.
some
years
earlier,
justice
cardozo
speaking
for
this
court
in
the
palko
case
warned
that
the
tyranny
of
labels
must
not
lead
us
to
lead
to
a
conclusion
that
a
word
which
in
one
set
of
facts
may
stand
for
oppression
or
enormity
is
of
like
the
fact
in
every
other.
justice
cardozo
was
there
again
speaking
about
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
would
have
this
court
adopt
a
very
rigid
and
inflexible
rule
which
under
some
circumstances
would
always
mean
that
after
the
discharge
of
a
jury,
the
defendant
had
been
in
prior
jeopardy
so
that
he
could
not
be
again
tried.
the
rule
might
be
stated
simply
as
this,
“the
absence
of
a
government
witness
never
justifies
the
discharge
of
a
jury
and
the
retrial
of
the
defendant.”
that
is
the
rule
which
the
court
in
cornero,
in
the
ninth
circuit
handed
down
in
1931.
the
reason
why
the
government
in
its
brief
in
this
case
did
not
spend
much
time
discussing
cornero
is
because
that
rule
was
vigorously
urged
upon
this
court
in
wade
against
hunter,
specifically
urged
and
specifically
rejected.
and
quoting
again
from
mr.
justice
black's
opinion
in
that
case,
we
are
asked
to
adopt
the
cornero
rule
on
which
--
under
which
petitioner
contends
the
absence
of
a
witness
can
never
justify
discontinuance
of
a
trial.
such
a
rigid
formula
is
inconsistent
with
the
guiding
principles
of
the
perez
doctrine
to
which
we
adhere.
so
this
court
has
had
this
argument
before.
this
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
cornero
sets
the
rule
which
should
be
followed
by
this
court
and
it
has
specifically
adopted
it.
now,
i'd
like
to
view
this
case
from
four
aspects,
which
i
think
are
very
important.
first
of
all
is
that
–
in
this
case
the
jury
was
discharged
before
it
even
assembled
to
hear
the
case,
before
opening
statements
had
been
made,
before
witnesses
were
sworn
or
any
testimony
heard.
secondly,
no
prejudice
whatsoever
resulted
to
the
defendant
in
this
case
in
being
tried
by
a
different
jury
two
days
later.
in
fact,
there
is
no
claim
of
prejudice.
and
thirdly,
that
the
culpability
of
the
prosecutor
in
producing
the
circumstances
which
caused
the
court
in
this
case
to
discharge
the
jury
to
the
extent
that
it
existed
at
all
was
slight
understandable
and
excusable
as
i
will
develop.
and
fourth
and
finally,
when
the
court
in
this
case
discharged
the
jury,
he
was
acting
in
an
area
in
which
this
court
has
time
and
again
says
it
has
wide
and
broad
discretion.
i
don't
believe
that
discretion
should
be
disturbed
in
this
case.
going
to
the
first
point
which
i
mentioned,
the
fact
that
this
jury
was
discharged
before
it
had
even
assembled
to
hear
the
case,
i'd
like
to
compare
this
case
with
some
of
the
other
cases
in
which
this
court
has
dealt
with
this
problem
of
whether
or
not
jeopardy
attaches
following
a
mistrial
so
as
to
prevent
the
retrial
of
the
defendant.
i
might
say
parenthetically
at
this
point
that
this
question
appears
to
have
been
before
this
court
on
seven
different
occasions
and
in
each
of
these
occasions,
the
right
of
the
retrial
was
upheld.
in
the
first
such
case,
the
perez
case
decided
in
1828,
we
have
the
classic
example
of
the
hung
jury
and
the
court,
this
court
for
the
first
time
held
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
did
not
prevent
the
government
from
retrying
a
defendant
under
those
circumstances.
a
later
case
in
1949
is
wade
against
hunter
to
which
i
have
already
referred.
this
is
the
court-martial
case
where
one
of
the
members
of
the
third
army
during
the
war
was
charged
with
the
rape
of
a
german
citizen.
the
case
was
fully
tried
before
the
court-martial
and
was
submitted
on
the
evidence
and
it
was
under
consideration
by
the
court-martial
board
when
the
board
itself
decided
they
wanted
to
hear
additional
evidence,
it
wanted
to
hear
the
testimony
of
the
mother
and
father
of
the
victim,
which
may
be
presumed
was
for
the
benefit
of
the
prosecution
in
that
case
are
operated
to
the
benefit
of
the
prosecution
in
that
case.
when
it
became
apparent
that
the
military
situation
made
it
somewhat
impractical
or
difficult,
certainly
not
impossible
to
obtain
these
testimonies
since
these
witnesses
were
about
75
miles
away
from
the
scene
of
the
court-martial,
the
commanding
general
of
the
third
army
ordered
that
the
board
be
dismissed
and
the
case
was
again
heard
by
another
court-martial
board
of
the
fifteenth
army.
that
board
convicted
and
on
appeal
to
this
court
following
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
this
court
reviewed
the
entire
proceeding
and
held
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
defendant
had
not
been
placed
in
jeopardy
so
as
to
prevent
his
retrial.
this
court
did
not
specifically
decide
whether
or
not
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
applied
to
court-martials,
but
it
did
decide
that
even
if
it
--
even
if
they
were
applicable,
it
had
not
been
violated
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
now,
i
submit
that
any
rule
of
law
–
that
if
the
rule
of
law
permits
a
defendant
to
be
tried
twice,
maybe
three
times
or
more
after
a
jury
has
heard
all
the
evidence
in
the
case
for
and
against
him
but
he's
not
able
to
agree
on
a
verdict,
it
would
be
a
most
incongruous
result
to
say
that
the
law
prevents
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
defendant
from
being
tried
even
once
on
the
--
for
the
offenses
charged
in
the
indictment.
second
point
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
the
fact
that
no
prejudice
has
been
shown
in
this
particular
case.
there
is
no
claim
of
prejudice
as
mr.
tinsman
has
pointed
out
in
his
argument.
there
was
some
suggestion
in
the
petitioner's
brief
that
perhaps
the
first
jury
might
have
been
more
favorable
than
the
second
jury,
but
that
the
plea
of
jeopardy
should
not
depend
upon
whether
or
not
he
can
prove
that
point
since
he's
not
susceptible
to
proof
and
i
agree.
he's
not
susceptible
to
proof
and
whether
or
not
one
jury
would
be
more
favorable
than
another
jury
i
think
is
irrelevant.
neither
the
government
nor
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
favorable
jury,
only
a
jury
which
is
fair
and
impartial
and
this
record
does
not
suggest
in
any
way
that
the
gov
--
that
the
jury
which
tried
the
defendant
was
in
any
way
not
fair
or
impartial.
moreover,
as
was
indicated
in
counsel's
argument,
neither
side
in
this
case
apparently
took
much
time
in
the
selection
of
the
jury
nor
did
the
composition
of
the
jury
seem
to
be
of
great
importance.
so
i
don't
think
that
we
have
any
element
of
prejudice
whatsoever
in
this
case.
the
third
point
i
would
like
to
discuss
is
the
culpability
of
the
prosecutor,
if
any
there
was,
in
producing
the
circumstances
which
cause
the
court
in
this
case
to
discharge
the
jury
which
had
been
first
sworn
to
try
the
defendant.
on
wednesday
or
thursday,
a
week
before
these
proceedings
occurred,
the
united
states
attorney's
office
was
notified
by
the
court,
12
cases
were
going
to
be
called
for
trial
on
monday.
at
that
time
the
record
reveals
there
were
two
assistants
available
to
try
cases
in
united
states
attorney's
office
in
san
antonio.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
did
try
this
case,
mr.
mcdonald,
stated
that
he
had
to
issue
more
than
100
subpoenas
between
the
time
he
received
this
notice
in
monday
of
the
week
in
which
these
proceedings
occur.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
not
in
this
case,
in
all
the
cases
which
had
been
assigned
to
him.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
1961,
in
the
early
spring
of
1961.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
at
that
particular
time,
in
the
san
antonio
office,
i
believe
there
were
three
assistants,
but
one
of
the
assistants
happened
to
be
on
military
leave.
and
the
u.s.
attorney
himself
was
made
his
office
there
and
there
were
two
assistants
available
to
try
cases
in
u.s.
attor
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
this
is
in
the
southern
district
--
in
the
western
district
of
texas.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
the
headquarters
are
in
san
antonio
and
it
is,
i
might
say,
a
very
large
district
which
makes
the
problem
of
subpoenas
a
very
difficult
one.
in
any
event,
this
was
number
10
of
the
12
cases
which
were
set
for
trial.
and
mr.
mcdonald
stated
in
the
colloquy
which
ensued
between
the
court
and
counsel
at
the
time
the
first
jury
was
discharged,
that
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
was
going
to
come
up
as
it
did
the
following
day,
tuesday.
on
monday
afternoon,
on
monday
afternoon,
mr.
mcdonald
checked
in
the
marshal's
office
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
subpoena
on
this
witness
had
been
served.
he
learned
that
this
--
that
this
witness
who
was
a
traveling
salesman
was
out
of
town.
the
witness
lived
in
san
antonio
but
the
marshal's
office
had
contacted
his
home.
they
reported
that
his
wife
said
that
she
would
get
in
touch
with
mr.
mcdonald.
and
that
was
all
he
did
monday
afternoon.
on
tuesday
morning,
he
was
completing
the
trial
of
another
case
when
he
was
notified
that
this
case
was
to
go
to
trial.
he
apparently
left
from
one
case,
from
one
courtroom
right
into
another
courtroom.
he
announced
he
was
ready
for
trial
when
this
case
was
called.
the
jury
was
empanelled
and
sworn;
the
court
recessed
for
lunch.
two
o'clock,
they
came
back
after
lunch
and
it
was
at
this
point
the
judge
announced
that
he
had
been
advised
by
mr.
mcdonald
that
the
government's
key
witness
was
not
available
and
that
he
was
going
to
discharge
this
jury
and
set
the
case
again
for
trial
later
that
week
and
that
is
what
he
did.
and
i
submit
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
not
the
--
and
it
that
appears
well
in
the
record,
yes.
the
record
does
reveal
that
he
was
a
traveling
salesman,
that
he
was
out
on
a
trip,
and
he
was
been
in
big
spring
in
odessa
and
the
marshal's
office
did
get
in
contact
with
him
wednesday,
the
day
after
the
first
jury
had
been
sworn
and
discharged,
they
got
in
touch
with
him
on
wednesday
in
odessa
or
big
springs,
texas
i
believe
and
told
him,
he
better
get
back
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
the
record
is
silent
as
to
when
the
subpoena
is
--
was
issued.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well
i
--
i
assume
it
was
sometime
between
thursday
and
monday.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
the
record,
well,
i
would
assume
there
was
an
attempt
to
serve
him
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
the
record
does
indicate
that
the
marshal's
office
had
contacted
the
man's
wife.
they
must
have
been
trying
to
serve
the
subpoena
on
monday,
because
when
mr.
mcdonald
checked
in
the
marshal's
office
on
monday
afternoon
about
this
specific
subpoena.
and
to
say
that
he
was
negligent
that
he
didn't
do
anything,
he's
issued
a
subpoena
at
this
point,
he's
checking
now
to
see
whether
it's
served
on
monday
not
knowing
that
this
case
is
even
going
to
come
up
the
following
day.
and
at
that
time,
he
learned
that
the
--
from
the
marshal's
office
that
they
had
been
in
contact
with
the
man's
wife,
and
had
learned
that
the
witness
was
out
of
town.
but
that
she,
the
wife
was
going
to
call
mr.
mcdonald
and
let
him
know
where
he
could
be
reached.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i'm
afraid
we
will
have
to
rely
in
justice
clark
to
take
judicial
notice
of
that.
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
don't
--
i
can't
answer
you
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no,
the
record
on
that
point
--
the
record
before
the
court
on
that
point
is
very,
very
brief.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
it
appears
on
page
10,
i
believe,
of
the
page
10
of
the
record.
and
it's
very
brief.
this
is
the
court
speaking
after
the
noon
recess.
mr.
tinsman,
in
your
case,
the
government's
key
witness
is
not
here.
they
announced
ready
and
didn't
have
the
witness
when
they
announced.
so
i'm
going
to
discharge
this
jury
from
this
case
and
pass
it.
and
there
was
a
discussion
about
as
mr.
tinsman
related.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
on
page
10
--
page
10
of
the
record.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
there's
no
indication.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
i
think
we
may
presume
that
when
the
u.s.
attorney
talked
to
the
judge
that
he
did
discuss
the
fact
that
he
was
--
the
witness
had
been
under
subpoena,
the
record
does
reveal
later
on
the
motion,
two
days
later
when
the
motion
went
--
or
rather
when
the
plea
of
prior
jeopardy
was
argued,
then
they
go
into
this
more
fully
and
developed
the
fact
that
the
witness
had
been
subpoenaed
that
he
had
been
--
that
mr.
mcdonald
had
checked
at
the
u.s.
attorneys
at
the
marshal's
office
the
day
before
and
--
and
so
forth.
the
record
is
silent
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
i'm
not
so
certain
that
the
judge
is
bound
to
act
in
this
matter,
in
a
matter
such
as
this
solely
on
what
appears
and
what
might
appear
on
open
court
or
might
be
testified
to
an
open
court
appear
on
the
record.
the
judge,
i
take
it,
was
satisfied
that
this
witness
was
unavailable
and
that
presumably
reasonable
efforts
was
made
to
secure
its
attendance.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
the
judge
doesn't
make
a
specific
finding
to
that
effect.
he
later
on
says
on
page
18.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no
this
was
when
the
--
this
was
when
the
--
they
were
arguing
the
plea
of
prior
jeopardy.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
the
record
does,
the
record
fails
to
reveal
at
that
particular
time
just
what
knowledge
the
judge
had.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
yes.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
if
there
is
--
i
think
the
record,
i
think
we
can
state
form
the
record
on
page
10.
i
think
we
may
assume
that
the
judge
did
have
knowledge,
the
same
knowledge
which
appeared
--
which
as
to
facts
which
later
appear
in
the
record
as
to
what
occurred
on
thursday
when
the
plea
or
on
friday
when
later
in
that
week,
when
the
plea
of
prior
jeopardy
was
argued.
i
think
we
may
assume
from
what
the
judge
did
on
tuesday
and
form
the
statement
to
which
mr.
justice
brennan
refers
on
page
10
of
the
record
that
he
had
these
facts,
the
essential
facts
before
him
as
to
what
had
occurred.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
presume
he
received
them
from
the
assistant
of
united
states
attorney.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
possibly,
probably
in
chambers
or
in
the
courtroom
before
the
court
convened.
i
don't
know
the
record
is
silent.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
what
is
that
sir?
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
yes,
they
recessed
for
lunch,
the
court
recessed
for
lunch
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
and
they
came
back
from
lunch
and
the
jury
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
that
statement
had
been
made
by
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
morning
prior
to
the
time
when
the
jury
was
selected.
he
announced
ready
for
trial
and
they
proceeded
to
select
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
yes.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
and
then
he
went
out.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
that's
correct.
and
as
far
as
this
record
--
as
far
as
this
record
before
the
court
is
concerned,
that's
the
first
thing
that
was
said
that
he
was
going
to
discharge
the
jury
because
of
the
absence
of
the
key
government
witness.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
the
defendant
at
that
time
--
the
defendant
at
that
time
objected
and
said
that
he
suggested
that
they
go
to
trial
on
those
counts
of
the
indictment
on
which
the
testimony
in
this
witness
--
on
which
the
testimony
of
this
witness
was
not
required.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no,
he
did
not
object
at
that
time.
well
later,
he
suggested
that
they
--
that
those
two
counts
be
dismissed
for
lack
of
prosecution.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no,
that
was
on
the
--
that
was
on
the
--
on
tuesday,
the
day
the
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no,
no.
no,
he
first
--
as
appears
on
the
record
on
page
10.
and
perhaps
it
will
be
helpful
if
i
read
in
full
it's
quite
brief.
mr.
mcdonald
stated,
“we
have
been
unable
to
have
the
subpoena
served
at
the
present
time.”
so
at
least,
the
court
did
know
that
the
subpoena
had
been
issued.
mr.
tinsman:
“your
honor,
i
feel
this
way
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
is
only
as
to
two
counts
of
the
indictment,
and
there
are
still
as
to
raymond
downum
four
other
counts
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
government
announced
ready,
and
we
picked
the
jury.
and
we
should
go
forward
at
this
time
on
the
counts
that
i
assume
they
are
ready
on
the
other
counts.”
the
court:
“do
you
want
to
have
two
trials?”
mr.
tinsman:
“at
this
time,
your
honor,
i
think
i'm
in
a
position
that
i
would
just
as
soon
have
two
trials.
i
picked
a
jury
and
i
think
that
it's
a
satisfactory
jury.”
the
court:
“i
am
not
willing
to
have
two
trials.
it
would
take
too
much
time
of
the
court.
the
government
shouldn't
have
picked
the
jury
when
they
weren't
ready.
unfortunately,
they
didn't
check
up
on
the
witnesses.”
that's
all
that
appears
in
the
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
yes,
excuse
me,
yes.
mr.
tinsman:
“let
me
make
a
motion
at
this
time
to
dismiss
count
six
and
seven
for
one
of
prosecution.”
“those
are
the
two
counts?”
“yes
sir.”
“i
will
overrule
the
motion
because
they
expect
to
give
you
a
trial
later
this
week
or
next
week.”
mr.
tinsman:
“alright,
sir.”
the
court:
“so
when
the
jury
comes
in,
i
will
just
discharge
them
from
this
case
and
may
use
them
on
another
case.
is
your
defendant
on
bond?”
“no,
the
defendant
is
in
the
county
jail.”
the
court:
“take
charge
of
him,
mr.
marshal.”
that's
all
that
the
record
reveals.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
the
record
doesn't
indicate
that
there
was
any
such
request,
although,
when
the
plea
of
prior
jeopardy
was
argued
two
or
three
days
later,
there
was
colloquy
which
is
sued
between
mr.
tinsman
and
mr.
mcdonald
in
which
mr.
tinsman
enlisted
it
from
mr.
mcdonald
just
what
he
had
done
with
respect
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
to
my
knowledge,
there
was
no
such
request,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
the
trans
--
the
transcript
doesn't
indicate
that,
sir.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
i
think
we
--
i
think
we
may
presume
that
mr.
mcdonald
did
talk
to
the
judge.
we
have
--
that's
a
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
assume
that,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
the
first
sentence
would
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
in
the
record,
he
said
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
have
to
rely
on
the
record
on
that
point,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
it
was
on
page
10.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
think
or
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
have
no
knowledge
that
there
was
any
such
suggestion
made
by
the
defense
counsel
in
this
case.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
that's
correct
and
i
would
assume
that
that
was
the
first
knowledge
that
mr.
tinsman
had
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
key
witness
who
was
missing
at
the
time.
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
it's
unfair
to
say
that
the
government
showed
any
lack
of
diligence
in
preparation
of
--
for
this
trial
in
view
of
the
circumstances
with
which
they
were
faced.
now,
the
government
was
operating
under
quite
some
burden
in
trying
to
secure
that
this
defendant
and
to
other
defendants
their
constitutional
rights
to
a
speedy
trial.
now,
the
fact
that
the
government
when
operating
under
some
burdens
may
create
a
circumstance
such
as
it
occurred
in
this
particular
case,
doesn't
in
and
of
itself
obviate
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights,
but
i
may
--
i
maintained
that
when
no
harm
is
shown
as
a
result
of
what
occurred
that
it's
just
absurd
to
say
that
this
defendant
cannot
be
tried
once
for
the
offenses
charged
in
the
indictment,
because
a
witness
wasn't
present.
this
united
states
attorney
had
100
witnesses
to
subpoena.
on
monday,
he
didn't
know
this
case
was
coming
to
trial
on
tuesday.
the
judge
was
obviously
doing
what
he
could
to
see
that
his
docket
was
made
current
in
trying
these
cases,
giving
these
defendants
as
they're
entitled
to
under
the
constitution
of
a
speedy
trial.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
don't
think
we
are
--
i
don't
think
we
are
at
all.
if
we
view
--
if
we
view
the
privilege
as
one
that's
designed
to
protect
the
defendant,
to
protect
him
from
harassment,
unfair
practice,
oppression,
certainly
in
this
instance,
when
he
was
tried
two
days
later
by
another
jury,
there's
not
nearly
the
oppression,
the
harassment,
the
expense
that
occurs
when
he
may
have
to
be
tried
two
and
three
times,
because
the
juries
disagree
or
it's
because
in
wade
against
hunter,
the
court-martial
board
wanted
to
hear
additional
evidence
from
two
other
witnesses.
i
think
as
i
said
before
that
it
would
be
a
most
incongruous
result
that
if
we
can
put
a
defendant
to
trial
two
and
three
times,
and
make
him
go
to
the
expense,
and
keep
him
under
the
suspense
that's
involved
in
those
situations,
it's
the
most
incongruous
rule
which
would
say
that
this
defendant
under
these
circumstances
--
and
i'm
stressing
the
circumstances
of
this
case
can't
be
tried
even
once
where
the
offenses
charged
in
the
indictment.
if
i
may
borrow
from
the
[inaudible]
of
the
tax
lawyers,
i
think
such
a
rule
exalts
form
over
substance.
we
have
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
that's
precisely
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no,
yes
i
think
there
was
a
--
and
the
second
jury
--
now
i
was
referring
to
that
part
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
this
jury
was
not
put
under
the
rule.
it
was
not
involved
with
respect
to
this
jury.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
think
i
can
answer
that
in
this
way.
that
gets
to
the
very
heart
of
another
point
which
i
haven't
had
time
to
discuss,
and
that
is
that
we
are
operating
here
in
an
area
in
which
this
court,
this
court
as
time
and
again
says
that
trial
judge
has
broad
discretion.
now,
judge
put
him;
he
could
have
held
this
jury,
he
could
have
held
this
jury
and
continue
the
case
for
one,
two,
or
three
days
until
this
witness
was
located
and
was
ready
to
testify
or
he
could
do
what
he
did.
now,
he
decided
that
this
jury
could
be
put
to
work
and
the
record
indicates
that
they
were.
so
that
the
other
defendants,
other
people
who
were
in
the
jail
at
that
particular
time
could
have
their
constitutional
right
to
a
speedy
trial
observed,
and
if
--
and
it's
just
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
presume
that
he
only
had
so
many
juries
available
to
try
these
cases
mr.
justice
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
they
talked
in
terms
of
bringing
28
in
at
the
time
this
jury
was
selected.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
that's
quite
possible.
i'd
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
it
could
have
worked
on
other
cases.
and
that's
--
that's
the
problem
that
the
judge
had.
now,
the
fifth
circuit,
talking
about
this
particular
point
states
the
protection
of
double
jeopardy
is
tested
against
the
action
taken
by
the
court.
consequently,
there's
a
secondary
importance
only
to
inquire
to
whether
the
action
or
inaction
of
the
prosecutor
and
not
earlier
subpoenaing
the
witnesses
was
or
was
not
justifiable
or
excusable.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
don't
know
exactly
how
many
in
this
case
overall.
they
testified
that
there
were
100
witnesses
and
they
had
to
be
subpoenaed.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
it
appears
about
two
hours
to
three
hours
to
try
this
case.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no,
those
witnesses
were
subpoenaed
with
respect
to
12
cases.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
think
we
have
to
take
into
consideration
the
burdens
of
the
united
states
attorney
in
this
situation
where
he
isn't
just
dealing
with
this
one
case.
now,
the
fact
that
he
has
these
burdens
never
excuses
the
violation
of
any
man's
constitutional
rights,
or
interests
that
are
designed
to
be
protected
by
the
constitution,
but
there's
no
evidence
that
this
man
was
prejudiced,
that
he
was
harassed.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
that's
correct.
and
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
don't
assume.
i
assume
that
there
was
no
prejudice
in
this
case
because
none
was
claimed
and
i
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well
i
don't
--
i
said
earlier
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
think
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
think
that's
true,
but
also
the
cases
have
held
that
the
plea
of
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
establish
the
validity
of
his
plea
of
prior
jeopardy.
cases
have
always
held
that.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
black,
is
that
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
the
government
didn't
ask
that
this
jury
be
passed.
this
was
a
decision
that
the
--
that
the
trial
judge
made.
the
trial
judge
exercised
his
discretion
but
not
to
continue,
but
to
discharge.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
based
upon
the
circumstances
of
which
he
had
knowledge
as
to
the
fact
that
there
was
--
the
government's
key
witness
was
not
present.
and
it
was
the
trial
judge,
not
the
united
states
attorney
that
made
the
decision
as
it
had
to
be.
in
fact,
the
trial
judge
didn't
even
suggest
that
the
jury
be
discharged.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
respectfully
disagree
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
think
that's
precisely
the
point.
there's
nothing
more
than
that.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
he
notified
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no,
but
i
surely
don't
think
that
there's
anything
improper
for
the
--
for
counsel
for
the
government
to
notify
--
to
tell
the
trial
judge,
even
in
the
absence
of
counsel
for
the
defendant
that
one
of
his
witnesses
isn't
there.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
at
that
time
in
san
antonio
at
least
or
there
was
just
one,
judge
rice,
isn't
that
correct?
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
that's
right.
and
these
were
all
matters,
and
i
stress
again,
these
were
all
decisions
which
were
made
by
the
trial
judge
in
the
exercise
of
a
discretion
which
this
court
time
and
time
again
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
agree
that
it's
not
unreviewable.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no,
but
i
think
we
have
far
--
there's
far
greater
danger
to
future
defendants
in
a
rule
which
restricts
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
than
one
which
maintains
that
discretion
unfettered
at
least
operate
in
circumstances
as
were
before
the
court
in
this
case.
i
think
it
works
to
the
benefit
of
the
defendants
that
the
trial
judges
have
wide
discretion
to
declare
mistrials
when
the
interest
of
justice
demands.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
perhaps
there
was
a
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
perhaps
there
was
some
irregularity
in
the
way
it
was
done.
but
surely,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
the
fifth
amendment
applies
to
the
second
proceeding
before
the
second
jury
can't
turn
on
the
manner
in
which
the
judge
received
notice
of
the
fact
that
one
of
the
--
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
well,
i
will
agree
that
the
record
indicates
that
this
judge's
mind
had
been
made
up
when
he
assumed
the
bench
at
two
o'
clock
because
he's
starting
off
by
saying,
“i'm
going
to
discharge
the
jury”.
he
did
permit
some
further
colloquy
to
--
between
the
counsel
and
the
court.
i
don't
think
his
mind
was
perhaps
irrevocably
made
up
at
that
particular
point.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
no
such
claim
has
ever
been
made,
mr.
justice
harlan
and
i
frankly
can't
see
the
relevance
--
the
relevancy
of
all
that.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
question
merely
turns
upon
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
in
the
exercise
of
his
discretion
acted
fairly
in
the
--
in
line
with
what
were
the
interest
of
this
defendant
and
the
interest
of
the
public
in
seeing
that
this
man
received
a
fair
trial
that
the
--
he
should
be
certainly.
i
think
most
people
would
agree
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
one
trial
which
we
haven't
had
or
wouldn't
have
in
this
case,
had
to
discharge
--
had
the
discharge
in
the
first
jury,
had
the
effect
at
two
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
--
on
that
afternoon
of
acquitting
this
defendant,
so
he
walked
out
of
the
court
a
free
man.
i
don't
think
the
fifth
amendment
requires
that
result.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
know.
i
think
that
points
up
the
unrealistic
position
that
the
petitioner
takes
before
the
court
at
this
particular
time.
it's
obvious
that
no
one
in
the
courtroom
at
two
o'clock
that
afternoon
thought
that
the
discharge
of
that
jury
would
have
the
effect
of
acquitting
the
defendant
right
then
and
there,
because
the
judge
announced
that
he's
going
to
reset
the
case
for
trial
two
days
later,
the
counsel
for
the
defendant
wouldn't
have
urged
the
court
after
the
court
announced
that
he
was
discharging
the
jury,
he
wouldn't
have
urged
the
court
to
go
to
trial
on
those
other
four
counts.
and
surely
the
government's
attorney
didn't
think
that
such
an
absurd
result
would
occur
but
the
government
would've
done
--
the
u.s.
attorney
would've
done
what
he
could
to
salvage
what
there
was
in
the
indictment
could
go
to
trial
on
the
other
four
counts.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
i
think
--
in
the
exuberance
of
advocacy,
i
hope
the
court
will
excuse
it.
[attempt
to
laughter]
my
time
is
far
elapsed
at
this
time.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
william
a.
geoghegan
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
