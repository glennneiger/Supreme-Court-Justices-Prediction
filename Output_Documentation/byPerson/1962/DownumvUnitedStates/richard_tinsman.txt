mr.
richard
tinsman
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
involving
the
question
of
a
former
jeopardy
and
the
sole
issue
presented
here
is
the
question
of
jeopardy.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
by
the
federal
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
texas
on
six
counts
of
an
indictment
which
charged
conspiracy,
to
steal,
forge,
and
pass
united
states
government
checks,
forging
and
passing
two
of
those
three
checks
and
passing
the
third
one.
he
was
convicted
and
an
appeal
was
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
sole
ground
of
former
jeopardy
and
the
opinion
was
affirmed
--
conviction
was
affirmed
and
here,
we
are
appealing
on
that
sole
ground.
as
the
court
of
appeals
stated
in
their
opinion,
the
facts
are
undisputed
and
very
simple
in
relation
to
the
jeopardy
question.
the
petitioner
was
arraigned
before
the
court
without
jury.
then
sometime
later,
both
sides
were
called
and
announced
ready
for
trial.
a
jury
was
selected
in
the
morning
and
the
jury
was
instructed
to
return
in
the
afternoon
at
two
o’clock.
then
sometime
before
two
o'clock,
apparently
an
out
of
court
conference
in
the
judge's
chambers
was
had
between
the
prosecutor
and
the
court.
and
at
two
o'clock,
the
court
announced
in
open
court
without
the
jury
being
in
the
room
that
the
government
had
informed
him
that
a
witness
as
to
count
six
and
seven
which
involved
one
check
was
absent
and
that
the
court
was
going
to
discharge
the
jury.
the
defendant's
counsel
objected,
asked
that
the
court
proceed
on
the
other
four
counts
for
which
the
prosecution
admittedly
had
enough
witnesses
to
convict;
the
court
overruled
this
motion.
the
defense
counsel
then
moved
to
dismiss
the
counts
six
and
seven
for
which
there
was
--
the
evidence
was
not
available,
the
court
overruled
this
motion,
and
discharged
the
jury.
two
days
later,
apparently,
the
missing
witness
was
found.
and
another
panel
was
called,
another
jury
was
selected,
and
this
jury
convicted
the
petitioner
on
all
six
counts.
a
plea
of
former
jeopardy
was
interposed
before
the
second
trial
which
was
overruled
by
the
trial
court.
so
we
are
here
today
on
the
question,
because
it
was
developed
in
the
trial
that
the
only
reason
that
the
first
jury
was
discharged
was
because
the
prosecutor
didn't
have
a
witness
and
this
witness
had
not
even
been
served
with
subpoena.
but
the
prosecutor
had
failed
to
check
with
the
u.s.
marshal's
office
directly
across
the
hall
from
his
own
before
he
selected
the
jury,
and
before
he
announced
ready.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
the
subpoena
was
issued
but
had
not
been
served.
mr.
richard
tinsman
there
is
no
showing
in
the
record
but
in
the
transcript,
it
developed
that
this
particular
witness
had
been
out
of
his
home
for
six
weeks
and
that
the
marshal
had
talked
with
the
wife
the
day
before,
and
--
but
the
prosecutor
--
and
the
prosecutor
had
checked
the
day
before
and
found
the
subpoena
had
not
been
served.
but
he
just
didn't
make
any
check
and
the
subpoena
was
not
served;
he
announced
ready
and
then
found
that
during
the
noon
hour
and
then
the
court
discharged
the
jury.
mr.
richard
tinsman
the
jury
was
sworn
in
the
morning,
your
honor,
and
that's
all
that
took
place.
the
jury
was
sworn
and
then
they
went
on
their
business
or
whatever
they
had
to
do
and
came
back
at
two
o'clock.
it
was
not
the
type
of
case
they
were
required
to
be
kept
together.
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
this
case,
there
is
no
question
of
bad
faith,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
was
negligence
on
the
prosecutor's
part
rather
than
bad
faith.
mr.
richard
tinsman
i
think
we
would
have
a
much
more
difficult
case,
your
honor
because
i
don't
think
there
would
be
the
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
or
the
--
in
other
words,
this
would
have
been
an
unforeseeable
circumstance
as
has
been
stated
in
some
of
the
former
cases.
but
it's
our
contention
that
this
was
a
foreseeable
circumstance
that
the
prosecutor
used
the
barest
minimum
of
preparation
to
check
and
see
if
this
witness'
subpoenas
had
been
served.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
the
plea
of
jeopardy
is
designed
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
defendant
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
prosecutor.
in
this
case,
it
was
the
court
that
discharged
the
jury.
the
court
could
have
refused
to
discharge
the
jury,
but
in
fact,
the
court's
opening
words
on
page
10
of
the
record
after
the
out
of
court
conference
was
that
the
government's
key
witness
is
not
here.
it
was
just
as
to
one.
they
announced
ready
and
didn't
have
the
witness
when
they
announced.
so
i'm
going
to
discharge
the
jury
from
this
case
and
pass
it
before
a
prosecutor
had
said
anything
in
open
court,
before
defense
counsel
had
said
anything.
this
jeopardy
provision
is
designed
to
protect
the
defendant
against
actions
of
the
court
because
anything
a
prosecutor
does,
the
court
can
overrule.
mr.
richard
tinsman
i
think
as
to
the
two
counts
that
they
were
not
ready
on.
i
think
he
would
have
been
in
position,
but
of
course
if
he'd
been
convicted
on
the
first
four,
the
government
probably
would
have
dropped
them
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that's
right.
the
reason
we
made
this
suggestion
is
we
were
satisfied
with
the
particular
jury
that
was
selected
and
we
wanted
this
jury
to
try
them
with
the
evidence
that
the
government
had
ready.
mr.
richard
tinsman
on
the
following
two
counts,
i
think
he
would
have.
of
course,
i
think
the
court
should
realize
this
was
a
complete
shock
to
me
when
the
court
came
in
and
announced
with
no
knowledge,
we
were
there
ready
to
go
to
trial
and
this
is
what
our
position
was
at
that
time.
we
have
not
researched
the
law
in
jeopardy
or
anything
else
and
i
think
the
court
hasn't
obviously
because
i
don't
think
the
court
would
have
done
what
he
did,
had
it
researched
the
law
on
jeopardy.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
i
don't
think
that
portion
is
before
the
court
today
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
--
but
intrinsically,
a
decision
of
this
court
that
he
was
in
jeopardy
because
the
prosecution
was
on
the
entire
case
but
it
would
somewhat
follow,
but
not
entirely
because
the
basic
proposition
here
was
the
government
got
a
new
trial
on
the
whole
thing,
not
just
the
two
counts
they
weren't
ready
on.
mr.
richard
tinsman
oh
definitely,
yes
sir.
and
i'm
going
to
get
that
in
the
case.
mr.
richard
tinsman
actually,
we're
considering
two
things
here.
first,
the
cases
that
have
been
already
decided
on
this
question
of
jeopardy,
and
secondly,
what
should
the
law
be
because
here
there
is,
there's
nothing
been
decided
on
its
precise
point
and
yet
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
and
the
ninth
circuit
back
in
1931
in
cornero.
in
our
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
our
district,
the
counsel
are
only
asked
--
allowed
to
ask
general
questions
of
the
panel
and
anyone
that
answers
the
general
question,
they're
permitted
to
interrogate,
and
i
think
it
took
approximately
15
minutes.
but
i
will
say
this
although
it's
not
in
the
record,
the
jury
was
such
--
the
next
defendant
took
the
jury
in
toto
without
picking
another
jury.
mr.
richard
tinsman
there
had
been
no
challenges
for
cause,
but
there
had
been
the
appropriate
strikes.
the
defendant
was
granted
10
strikes
and
the
prosecutor
is
granted
six.
mr.
richard
tinsman
that's
correct,
peremptory
strikes,
but
there
were
no
challenges
to
cause
on
either
panel.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
[inaudible]
that's
on
the
jury.
mr.
richard
tinsman
nine
[inaudible]
on
the
jury.
[attempt
to
laughter]
actually
in
this
field,
there
are
three
important
cases
that
we
consider
vital
and
that's
the
cornero
case
decided
in
1931
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
gori
case
that
this
court
decided
in
june
of
1961,
in
a
five
to
four
decision
where
mr.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
the
majority
opinion
and
mr.
justice
douglas
wrote
the
dissent,
and
the
perez
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1824.
now,
the
cornero
case,
of
course,
is
the
--
actually
the
strongest
case
that
petitioner
has.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
was
charged
just
a
one
count
indictment
with
conspiracy
to
“possess
and
transport”
intoxicating
liquor.
he
was
indicted
with
three
other
co-defendants
and
they
had
all
plead
guilty
at
a
previous
--
previous
hearing
and
they
were
out
on
their
bond
and
their
bond
required
them
to
return
when
the
trial
of
the
fourth
defendant,
cornero,
came
up.
and
so
the
prosecutor
announced
ready
on
the
assumption
that
these
other
defendants
would
not
forfeit
their
bond
and
would
appear
since
they‘d
already
plead
guilty.
on
the
day
of
the
trial,
the
witnesses
didn't
show
up.
and
so
the
prosecutor
announced
that
he
wasn't
ready
and
in
this
case,
cornero
asked
for
a
continuance
and
they
went
out
and
tried
to
find
the
witnesses.
well
they
got
continuances
for
five
days
and
they
still
couldn't
find
them
so
the
judge
dismissed
the
jury.
two
years
later,
they
finally
found
them.
so
they
brought
cornero
back;
they've
picked
another
jury,
he
was
convicted,
and
he
appealed
aptly
a
former
jeopardy.
the
ninth
circuit
held
he
had
been
placed
in
jeopardy.
and
the
language
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
particularly
significant,
and
we
would
like
to
call
it
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
it
said
the
fact
is
that
when
the
district
attorney
empanelled
the
jury
without
first
ascertaining
whether
or
not
his
witnesses
were
present,
he
took
a
chance,
this
appears
in
page
7
of
our
brief.
there
is
no
difference
in
principle
between
the
discovery
by
the
district
attorney
immediately
after
the
jury
was
empanelled
that
his
evidence
was
insufficient
and
the
discovery
after
he'd
call
some
or
all
of
his
witnesses.
so
we
say
that
the
cornero
case
is
similar
that
this
was
after
the
first
jury
was
picked,
no
evidence
was
put
on,
the
witnesses
weren't
there.
the
jury
was
discharged
and
he
was
tried
and
convicted
by
a
different
jury.
now,
the
government
points
out
in
this
case,
it's
virtually
on
all
force,
the
government
devotes
only
one
paragraph
to
it
on
page
33
and
34
of
their
brief.
and
their
only
method
of
distinction
it
says,
it
says,
“in
a
realistic
sense,
it
could
be
said
that
the
government
proceeded
the
trial
without
his
evidence
in
cornero,
but
in
this
case
on
the
other
hand,
the
government
was
not
preceding
the
trial
without
knowing
that
it
had
the
witnesses
to
prove
its
case.”
well
frankly,
we
do
not
see
the
distinction
the
government
makes.
the
only
essential
distinction
is
that
there
was
two
days
rather
than
two
years.
and
we
say
that
this
is
not
a
meaningful
distinction
in
the
concept
of
jeopardy.
the
gori
case
test
is
not
the
test
of
harassment
which
apparently
the
government
on
page
39
would
indicate
that
the
test
in
jeopardy
cases
are.
the
gori
case
indicated
that
they
specifically
said,
“we
will
not
anticipate
the
situation
in
which
a
judge
exercises
his
authority
to
help
the
prosecution
at
a
trial
in
which
its
case
is
going
badly
by
affording
in
another
more
favorable
opportunity
to
convict
the
accused.
well,
in
this
case,
it's
our
position
that
in
a
sense,
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
did,
and
the
government
was
not
ready,
it
couldn't
convict
on
count
six
and
seven
and
so
the
judge
gave
it
a
new
--
another
chance
to
convict
not
only
on
both
counts,
but
on
all
of
the
other
counts
in
the
indictment.
now,
i
think
it's
also
significant
to
look
at
justice
douglas'
language
in
the
dissent
where
he
says
that,
“once
a
jury
has
been
empanelled
and
sworn,
jeopardy
attaches
and
a
subsequent
prosecution
is
barred
if
a
mistrial
is
ordered,
absent
the
showing
of
imperious
necessity.”
the
prosecution
must
stand
or
fall
on
its
performance
at
the
trial.
i
do
not
see
how
a
mistrial
directed
because
the
prosecution
has
no
witnesses.
it's
different
from
a
mistrial
directed
because
the
prosecutor
abuses
his
office
and
is
guilty
of
misconduct.
mr.
richard
tinsman
this
is
a
slightly
harder
question
but
on
theory,
i
don'
think
it
would,
your
honor,
because
i
think
the
basic
proposition
is
whether
you‘re
giving
this
--
the
government
a
chance
to
go
ahead
and
pick
the
entire
jury,
didn't
look
and
see
what
kind
of
a
jury
they‘re
getting
and
then
elect.
well,
we
got
one
witnesses
to
a
few
counts
of
this
multi-count
indictment
so
we'll
get
a
new
jury
as
to
the
whole.
the
government
in
this
case
could
have
gone
ahead
and
tried
the
defendant
on
those
four
counts
that
they
were
ready
on,
they
elected
not
to
do
so.
they
could
have
requested
a
continuance.
they
elected
not
to
do
so,
and
use
the
same
jury.
and
we
feel
that
when
the
government
asked
for
a
discharge
of
the
jury,
well,
the
court
grants
one
rather
than
getting
a
continuance
after
announcing
ready,
i
don't
think
the
mere
swearing
of
the
jury
is
anything
once
they‘ve
seen
who
all
the
jurors
are
and
the
strikes
have
been
announced,
and
the
12
people
have
been
picked,
i
think
that's
the
essential
thing
as
far
as
reasoning
goes
but
of
course
we
don‘t
have
to
consider
that
here
because
the
jury
was
sworn.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
there
was
no
indication
one
way
or
the
other.
now,
the
government
makes
a
contention
in
their
brief,
there
was
no
way
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
in
the
first
trial,
the
government
used
three.
in
the
second,
they
used
all
six.
mr.
richard
tinsman
three
out
of
six.
second
trial
they
used
six.
the
government
--
the
government
of
course
relies
on
the
perez
case
and
particularly
on
the
broad
language
of
the
perez
case
where
it
states
that
the
law
has
invested
courts
of
justice
with
authority
to
discharge
a
jury
from
giving
any
verdict
whenever
in
their
opinion
taking
all
its
circumstances
into
consideration
there
is
a
manifest
necessity
for
the
act
or
the
ends
of
public
justice
would
otherwise
be
defeated.
i
think
that
this
broad
language
of
perez
which
is
also
quoted
in
gori
is
something
that
is
used
sometimes
out
of
context
because
of
course
perez
was
only
a
case
which
established
that
a
hung
jury
did
not
result
in
jeopardy.
and
it's
particularly
significant
that
while
the
government
says
that
the
manifest
--
the
ends
of
public
justice
should
be
a
consideration.
in
effect,
the
fifth
circuit
said
it
should
be
the
only
consideration.
on
page
40
of
the
record,
they
wrote
that
perez
held
that
a
judge
may
discharge
a
jury
within
sound
discretion
without
operating
as
an
acquittal
when
the
ends
of
public
justice
require
it.
but
we
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
just
--
by
that
language
saying
that
the
discretion
as
to
--
the
question
of
jeopardy
is
completely
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
and
we
think
that
it
is
not
--
if
there
is
some
limits
on
the
trial
court's
discretion.
and
we
think
one
of
them
is
that
when
the
trial
court
declares
a
mistrial,
purely
to
help
the
prosecution
prove
its
case
against
the
defendant
that
in
that
case,
the
jeopardy
does
attach.
now,
we'd
like
to
say
one
thing
about
the
government's
contentions
in
their
brief
that
seemed
rather
odd
to
petitioner.
on
page
31
of
their
brief,
they
state,
“however
the
fact
the
jeopardy
may
have
attached
does
not
however
compel
a
reversal.”
on
page
32,
they
say,
“the
prior
jeopardy
in
this
case
was
jeopardy
only
in
the
most
technical
sense
of
the
term,
but
it's
our
opinion
that
jeopardy
is
jeopardy
and
it's
like
saying
that
somebody
is
just
a
little
bit
pregnant.”
there
just
isn‘t
any
in
between
and
in
fact
on
page
7
of
their
brief
they
say,
“contrary
to
petitioner's
contention,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
impose
a
fixed
rule
that
once
a
defendant
has
been
placed
in
jeopardy,
he
cannot
be
brought
before
a
second
jury.”
they
cite
no
case
for
this
and
it's
our
contention
that
this
is
the
very
question
this
court
must
decide
is
whether
or
not,
the
defendant
was
placed
in
jeopardy.
the
legal
sense
of
jeopardy
is
in
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
that's
the
real
question.
not
whether
he
was
in
technical
jeopardy
or
any
other
kind
of
jeopardy
but
whether
he
was
in
jeopardy
at
all.
now,
i
would
like
to
comment
on
the
case
of
wade
versus
hunter
that
mr.
justice
black
decided
that
the
government
relies
on.
this
was
a
case
involving
unforeseen
circumstances
as
it
was
clearly
shown
by
the
opinion.
a
court
marital
of
the
defendant
was
recessed
because
of
a
tactical
situation
of
the
army
in
the
field.
the
army
had
moved
forward,
the
witnesses
were
not
available.
and
the
court
held
that
this
was
such
a
case
of
unforeseen
circumstances
that
jeopardy
would
not
attach.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
government
sets
up
a
strong
man
and
in
effect
and
they
say
with
the
petitioners
contending
for
a
rule
like
--
of
cornero
that
whenever
a
jury
is
discharged
after
it
is
empanelled
and
sworn,
the
jeopardy
attaches.
that
is
not
our
position
at
all.
our
position
on
page
13
of
our
brief
is
that
jeopardy
attaches
when
there
is
an
imperious
necessity,
unforeseen
circumstances
or
the
mistrial
has
been
granted
in
the
sole
interest
of
the
defendant
as
it
was
in
gori,
but
in
here,
none
of
that
exists.
there
were
no
unforeseen
circumstances
that
the
prosecutor
couldn't
have
found
out
if
he'd
exercised
the
least
diligence
whatsoever.
there
was
no
doing
just
for
the
interest
of
the
defendant;
it
was
purely
for
the
interest
of
the
prosecution.
and
finally,
there
was
no
imperious
necessity
that
this
be
done
again.
the
cases
that
have
held
that
are
--
and
that
jeopardy
did
not
attach
are
cases
were
something
that
couldn't
be
determined.
a
hung
jury,
for
example,
is
an
unforeseen
circumstance.
now,
we're
not
actually
trying
to
change
the
law.
we
cite
in
our
brief,
the
shoemaker
case
which
was
decided
in
1840
and
one
of
the
old
federal
cases
and
this
says,
“however
guilty
the
defendant
may
be,
he
can
only
be
convicted
according
to
law.
and
a
jury
having
been
sworn
to
try
his
case,
he
has
a
right
to
their
verdict
unless
some
inevitable
occurrence
shall
interpose
and
prevent
the
rendition
of
a
verdict.
before
he
goes
to
trial,
the
prosecutor
should
see
that
his
witnesses
are
in
attendance
and
that
he
is
prepared
to
try
any
issue.”
this
was
as
far
back
as
1840.
he
also
cites
the
watson
case
in
1868.
so
we
are
saying
that
here,
the
law
is
that
a
mistrial,
because
the
government
has
no
witnesses
as
to
a
few
counts
of
a
multi-count
indictment
for
which
the
prosecutor
could
have
found
out
that
he
didn't
have
witnesses
before
he
announced
ready,
is
something
that
places
the
defendant
in
jeopardy.
this
falls
within
none
of
the
exceptions
of
the
jeopardy
rule.
now,
the
second
point
is,
well
--
what
should
the
law
be?
because
as
we
saw
on
monday,
the
court
can
change
the
law
as
they
changed
betts
and
brady.
we
feel
that
there's
no
question
that
this
is
the
way
that
the
law
should
be.
this
--
the
alternatives
were
very
simple.
the
court
could
have
simply
declared
the
continuance,
told
the
jury
to
go
home,
come
back
whenever
they
found
the
witness.
they
found
him
two
days
later.
the
court
stated
in
page
10
of
the
transcript,
“we
expect
to
give
you
a
trial
this
week.”
there
was
no
necessity
for
discharging
this
jury.
we
feel
that
the
basic
vice
in
this
is
that
it
opens,
although
in
this
case
there
was
no
abuse.
we
are
not
saying
that
the
prosecutor
was
hiding
this
witness
out.
but
that
this
case,
if
it
is
affirmed,
opens
the
door
to
abuse,
opens
the
door
to
a
government
prosecutor
in
an
important
case
to
have
one
witness
as
to
one
or
two
counts
of
a
multi-count
indictment,
some
place
without
a
subpoena
served
on
them
and
then
if
he
gets
a
jury
that
is
unsatisfactory,
go
to
the
court
and
say,
“we
can't
locate
this
witness.”
we
would
like
this
jury
discharged
and
another
one
had
and
here's
the
authority
for
downum
versus
unites
states.
and
we
say
that
when
you
open
that
risk
of
judicial
arbitrariness
that
justice
douglas
talked
about
in
the
opinion
in
gori,
that
this
is
something
that
shouldn't
be
done.
mr.
richard
tinsman
i
would
briefly
like
to
reply
to
the
government's
contention
that
there
is
a
danger
in
future
cases
if
this
case
is
not
affirmed.
i
think
if
--
i
mean
if
this
case
in
hunter
that
the
government's
condition
--
contention
is
not
sustained.
if
the
court
reverses
this
case,
the
only
thing
it
will
be
saying
is
that
government
prosecutors
must
ascertain
whether
not
their
witnesses
are
served
with
the
subpoena
before
they
announce
ready
for
trial.
and
if
they
announce
ready
for
trial,
and
then
find
that
their
witnesses
aren't
present
as
to
some
count
of
a
multi-count
indictment,
they
cannot
secure
a
discharge
of
the
jury
without
putting
the
defendant
in
jeopardy.
and
once
this
case
has
decided
that
way,
i
don't
think
any
government
prosecutors
will
the
mistake
that
mr.
mcdonald
and
the
court
made
in
this
particular
case.
the
--
much
of
the
argument
was
devoted
to
this
excusable
nature
of
what
the
prosecutor
did,
but
i
think
it's
implicit
from
the
record.
the
defendant
was
in
the
county
jail.
this
was
the
number
10
case.
obviously,
arrangements
had
to
be
made
to
bring
the
defendant
from
the
county
jail.
during
that
time,
when
the
defendant
was
being
brought
from
the
county
jail,
there's
no
showing
that
the
prosecutor
could
not
have
checked
his
witnesses.
there
is
a
showing
in
this
case
that
in
the
colloquy
between
counsel
after
the
concerning
his
preparedness
that
there
were
a
number
of
secretaries
in
the
office,
five
secretaries.
he
could
have
asked
one
of
the
secretaries,
go
check
and
see
if
all
the
subpoenas
were
served
on
the
witnesses
before
i
announced
ready
for
trial.
the
marshal
officers
right
across
from
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
and
in
fact
he's
right
down
the
hall
from
the
courtroom.
there
was
no
real
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir.
i
have
not.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
i've
served
in
--
pull
off
his
having
many
civil
cases,
your
honor
and
i
know
what
the
present
business
is
but
i
also
know
the
penalties
for
making
mistakes.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir,
i
do
not
because
they
had
contacted
his
wife
and
she
had
told
obviously
he
was
in
big
spring,
they've
contacted
his
wife
so
she
was
to
call
him
and
tell
him
to
come
in.
so
the
marshal,
instead
of
calling
him
himself,
simply
relied
on
the
wife
to
call
him
and
tell
him
to
come
in
and
the
real
point
is
not
whether
the
subpoena
was
served,
your
honor.
the
point
is
that
the
prosecutor
didn't
check
and
see
whether
or
not
it
was
served
before
he
announced
ready.
that's
the
point
of
the
case.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
the
practice
in
the
western
district
is
for
all
defendants
to
plead
before
the
court
so
they're
all
not
guilty
pleas.
guilty
pleas
can
be
taken
in
the
court
and
then
once
the
defendant
has
pled
not
guilty,
the
juries
are
brought
in.
i
also
might
say
in
regard
to
some
of
the
questions
as
to
practice
to
select
the
number
of
juries
at
one
time
from
the
same
panel.
and
this
particular
time,
this
jury
--
had
selected
two
juries
were
selected
that
morning.
and
then
another
trial
went
on.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir,
the
indictment
was
read
to
the
jury
in
this
--
in
the
second
trial
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
tinsman
nothing
was
done.
in
other
words,
the
jury
had
been
sworn
in
the
box
and
then
sworn
and
then
nothing
else
happened.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
and
actually
i
think
that
from
a
standpoint
of
reasoning
that
what
difference
would
it
make
is
far
as
the
defendant's
right
for
concern
or
--
good
to
be
gained
by
the
government,
it's
simply
the
indictment
had
been
read
or
one
witness
had
testified
even
just
stated
his
name.
i
don't
think
that
that
would,
as
a
matter
of
law,
should
change
the
rights
of
the
various
defendants
to
that
particular
thing.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no.
at
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
i'll
agree
that
it
perhaps
--
it
is
a
circumstance
to
be
considered
but
it's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
the
cases
have
held
that
the
circumstances
to
be
considered
are:
number
one,
unforeseeable
circumstances;
number
two,
imperious
necessity
as
in
wade
versus
hunter;
and
number
three,
as
in
gori,
the
question
of
whether
it
was
done
for
the
sole
interest
of
the
defendant.
and
we
say
that
none
of
the
cases
have
held
that
a
circumstance
to
be
considered
is
whether
or
not
the
indictment
was
read,
none
of
the
cases
have
based
on
that
particular
facet.
mr.
richard
tinsman
alright
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
there
were
approximately
40,
i
would
say.
mr.
richard
tinsman
only
one
judge,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
he
was
trying
a
case
on
monday,
he
called
tuesday
morning
or
some
other
--
the
other
defendants
have
plead
guilty
he's
said,
“we're
going
to
pick
the
juries
for
tuesday
afternoon.”
and
the
next
day,
so
tuesday
morning,
everyone
came
up,
the
counsel
and
i
came
up
and
the
counsel
on
the
next
case
came
up
and
the
juries
were
picked.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes,
sir
and
then
the
jury
was
released
and
told
to
come
back
at
two
o'clock.
mr.
richard
tinsman
my
jury
was
released.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
that's
right.
in
other
words
--
so
that
his
position
was
that
he
wanted
to
go
immediately
into
the
trial
of
my
case
as
soon
as
he
finished
the
first
case.
mr.
richard
tinsman
well,
that's
the
practice
of
the
court
in
the
western
district
is
that
they
select
the
number
of
juries
in
advance,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
they
don't
leave
him
waiting.
they
tell
them
they
can
go
back
to
their
businesses
and
tell
them
to
come
at
a
certain
time.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
you
turn
the
rest
of
the
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
that's
--
that
is
absolutely
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
that's
correct.
so
that
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
that's
a
--
mr.
richard
tinsman
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes,
sir.
he
could've
done
that.
mr.
richard
tinsman
no
sir,
i
did
not.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes,
sir.
i
may
say
–-
mr.
richard
tinsman
well
your
honor,
in
the
view
of
the
fact
that
this
the
was
first
criminal
case
i
ever
tried,
[attempt
to
laughter]
i
was
not
quite
as
really
familiar
with
the
criminal
law
as
i
should've
been.
mr.
richard
tinsman
yes
sir.
i
was
appointed
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
richard
tinsman
thank
you
very
much.
