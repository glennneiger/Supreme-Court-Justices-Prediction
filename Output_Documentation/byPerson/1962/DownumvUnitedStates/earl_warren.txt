chief
justice
earl
warren
raymond
downum,
petitioner,
versus
united
states.
mr.
tinsman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
before
the
trial
had
it
been
issued?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
jury
--
the
jury
sworn
to
try
the
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
would
have
been
entitled
a
plea
once
in
jeopardy
if
--
even
though
his
counsel
made
the
suggestion
that
they
go
to
trial
on
the
four
counts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
but
if
the
court
had
followed
your
suggestion
of
trying
them
on
four
counts
and
then
later,
as
you
suggested,
trying
them
on
the
other
two,
do
you
think
he'd
been
once
in
jeopardy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
we
haven't
gone
as
far
in
this
court
as
to
hold
that
that
would
be
the
situation?
that
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
--
to
a
plea
once
in
jeopardy
if
the
court
had
followed
your
suggestion
to
try
him
later
on
the
other
two
counts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'm
sorry.
i
know.
i'm
just
talking
about
the
two
counts
though.
would
that
be
any
different
than
when
the
defendant
asked
for
a
mistrial
for
some
reason
or
another,
some
misconduct
in
the
part
of
the
--
of
--
of
the
prosecutor?
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright,
go
right
ahead.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
geoghegan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
there
any
discussion
at
the
time
the
jury
was
discharged
as
to
why
this
man
was
not
there
or
was
there
any
justification
or
shown
by
the
prosecution
for
this
discharge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
that
indicate
that
the
court
and
the
prosecutor
had
determined
beforehand
that
this
jury
would
be
discharged?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is
any
thing
here
to
indicate
that
the
court
exercised
any
discretion.
there
isn't
any
evidence
on
which
he
could
do
it.
he
merely
says,
“mr.
tinsman,
in
your
case,
the
government's
key
witness
is
not
here,
that's
the
beginning
of
it.”
they
announced
ready
and
didn't
have
the
witness
when
they
announced
so
i'm
going
to
discharge
the
jury
in
this
case
and
pass
it.
there
wasn't
any
--
wasn't
any
hearing,
there
wasn't
anything
any
opportunity
to
show
whether
it
was
in
good
faith
or
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
shouldn't
--
shouldn't
the
judge
exercise
this
discretion
on
what
happens
in
the
court
rather
than
--
rather
than
what
the
prosecutor
tells
him
out
of
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
does
it
ever
--
where
does
it
say
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
at
the
same
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
on
a
different
occasion
and
this
is
when
the
court
took
the
action
to
dismiss
this
jury
and
that's
a
critical
time
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
there
is
a
little
more,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
based
upon
--
but
based
upon
colloquy
obviously
that
was
made
with
them
in
the
chambers,
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
counsel
and
the
defendant.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
inference
to
be
drawn
at
all,
i
think
the
inference
could
be
drawn
that
prosecutor
in
chambers
in
the
absence
of
counsel
for
the
defendant
asked
the
judge
to
dismiss
this
jury
because
he
didn't
have
his
witness
there
and
the
judge
came
out
of
the
bench
and
immediately
said,
“the
prosecution
doesn't
have
his
witnesses
here
and
i'm
going
to
discharge
the
jury.”
isn't
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
he
had
notified
the
judge
in
the
morning
that
he
was
ready,
had
he
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
he
notified
the
judge
that
he
was
ready
in
the
presence
of
counsel
and
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant?
and
then
sometime
between
then
and
two
o'clock,
he
was
in
the
judge's
chambers
and
conveyed
some
information
to
him
about
his
witnesses
that
the
defense
knows
nothing
about,
and
then
the
judge
peremptorily
discharged
this
jury.
is
there
any
--
is
there
anything
more
than
that
in
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
tinsman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
mr.
tinsman,
i
know
regardless
of
how
this
case
may
be
decided
that
every
member
of
the
court
would
want
me
to
express
our
appreciation
for
your
having
accepted
the
burden
of
representing
this
indigent
defendant.
we're
always
comforted
by
the
fact
that
lawyers
are
willing
to
do
that
but
yours
is
a
rather
outstanding
and
unusual
case
because
you
were
appointed
by
the
district
court
to
represent
this
man,
you
represented
him
in
that
court,
you
then
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
represented
him
there
by
assignment
also.
and
then
we
assigned
you
to
--
to
do
it
in
this
court.
i
consider
that
an
outstanding
service
to
the
public
and
we
thank
you.
and
mr.
geoghegan,
of
course,
we
rest
our
appreciation
to
you
for
the
very
earnest
and
favorable
manner
in
which
you
represent
the
interest
of
the
government.
