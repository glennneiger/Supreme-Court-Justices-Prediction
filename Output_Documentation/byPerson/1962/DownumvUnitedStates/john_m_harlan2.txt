justice
john
m.
harlan
was
the
subpoena
issued?
justice
john
m.
harlan
suppose
the
jury
has
been
discharged
just
after
the
case
both
sides
then
came
to
the
jury
before
they
were
sworn,
the
jury
then
is
discharged.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
was
no
indication
that
the
government
was
dissatisfied
with
the
jury?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
peremptory
challenges
did
the
government
use?
justice
john
m.
harlan
out
of
how
many?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
large
was
the
united
states
attorney's
office
at
that
time?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
request
by
the
defense
counsel
to
examine
the
u.s.
attorney
on
voir
dire
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
to
find
out
the
circumstances
at
the
failure
of
the
subpoena?
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
not
on
the
day
in
which
this
--
the
jury
was
first
discharged.
was
the
defense
counsel
foreclosed
of
making
any
inquiries
to
the
circumstances
of
the
nonappearance
of
this
witness
beyond
what
appears
in
this
record?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
intimation
made
that
this
was
the
result
of
some
of
kind
of
an
ex
parte
arrangement
between
the
judge
and
the
united
states
attorney?
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
obvious
that
the
united
states
attorney
had
notified
the
judge
in
the
chambers.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
my
question
was,
were
there
any
suggestions
made
by
defense
counsel
that
was
improper
conduct
either
on
the
part
of
the
judge
or
the
united
states
attorney?
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
i
was
in
the
united
states
attorney's
office,
maybe
the
practice
has
changed.
we
conceded
to
be
our
duty
to
notify
a
judge
who
is
in-charge
of
the
calendar
part
whether
our
cases
for
some
reason
or
other
would
going
to
go
on
or
whether
they
were
going
to
go
off.
and
has
any
suggestion
been
made
in
this
case
that
the
united
states
attorney
was
doing
anything
improper
in
doing
what
obviously
this
record
shows
he
did
was
to
notify
the
judge
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
able
to
go
having
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
judges
are
there,
in
this
district
that
was
there?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
he
was
the
county
judge
and
the
trial
judge
and
the
others
responsibility
to
keeping
the
wheel
of
justice
moving.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
had
just
been
looking
at
the
petitioner's
brief
on
which
i
was
unable
to
read.
i
don't
find
any
suggestion
in
the
brief
intimation
that
the
way
in
which
this
matter
was
handled
by
the
judge
to
distinguish
whether
there
was
negligence
or
whatever
you
choose
to
call
it
in
the
part
of
the
district
attorney
and
not
having
the
witness
present.
i
don't
find
any
suggestion
that
there
was
any
impropriety
in
the
way
this
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
judge.
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
ever
served
in
the
united
states
attorney's
office?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
never
had
the
present
business
dissenting
on
the
open
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
you
showed
extraordinary
conscientious
as
to
the
weighing
of
this
case
