do
you
explain
a
case
like
weber
against
squier
as
being
based
upon
the
fact
that
they
had
the
wrong
respondent,
that
there
had
been
a
substitution
of
the
parole
board
in
that
case,
the
(voice

--
that
there
might
have
been
a
general
position.
in
other
words,
you’d
construe
that
case
as
not
foreclosing
or
is
not
being
a
precedent
against
you?
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
a
jurisdiction
on
your

the
question
here,
rather
one
of
the
jurisdiction.
what
district
was
this,
what
district
was
this?
justice

that’s
where
the

was,

that’s
where
the

is
that
where
--
also
where
that
parole
board
is?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
parole
board
of
statewide
--
justice

in
the
eastern

so
there's
no
problem
there?
justice

the
petitioner
himself
is
in
georgia?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
that
his
geographical
location
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
any
event
the
respondent
is

would
be
the
custodian

justice

other
than

justice

how
about

he’s
not
allowed
to
own
or
operate
a
motor
vehicle?
justice

stewart
and
he’s
required
to
permit
his
parole
officer
to
visit
his
home
or
place
of
employment
at
any
time?
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
parole
officer
wants
to
presumably
come
in

in
midnight
some
night

justice
potter

--
to
see
what
he’s
doing
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
who
knows?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
you
wouldn’t
--
you
wouldn’t
quarrel
as
this
state
--
the
statement
that
it’s
fair
to
say
that
this
fellow
was
subject
to
considerably
more
control
and
considerably
more
restrictions
than
are
placed
by
society
on
the
average
member
of
society.
justice
potter
stewart
to
be
sure,
we
all
are
suppose
to
obey
them
all
but
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
we’re
all
under
economic
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
involvement.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
releases
him
to
the
custody
or
supervision
of
a
parole
officer,
isn’t
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
first
to
the
parole
board?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
parole
board
sets
up
certain
conditions
and
releases
him
under
those
conditions
to
the
supervision
of
a
parole
officer?

49(1).
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
just
go
to
court
and
get
an
order
though
under
that
rule,
would
it
not?
justice

stewart
can
you
imagine
the

would
not?
