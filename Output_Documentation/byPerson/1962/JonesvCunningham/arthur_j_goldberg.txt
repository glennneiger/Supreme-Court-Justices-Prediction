justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
meador,
in
that
action,
did
he
address
himself
to
this
comment
on
page
31
of
the
supreme
court
--
of
the
court
of
appeals
where
they
said
that
really
the
custody
and
parole
was
not
a
real
custody
because
anybody,
any
citizen
who
performs
the
acts
that
were
specified
of
the
parole
order
would
be
subject
to
arrest.
do
you
think
the
citizen
would
be
subject
to
arrest
if
he
didn’t
keep
good
hours,
he
didn’t
keep
good
company?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
harp
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
thought
you
have
an
arrangement
with
georgia
[inaudible]
a
violation
of
the
law?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that’s
alright.
go
ahead.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
to
go
right
back
to
such
a
point
that
i’m
in,
wasn’t
it
that
the
man
was
sent
to
georgia
under
the
uniform
act,
that’s
correct,
isn’t
it?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
looking
at
the
language
of
the
uniform
act
which
is
cited
on
page
34
of
the
brief
for
the
petitioner
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
the
authority
of
the
--
your
state
under
this,
the
whole
section
is
not
quoted,
but
i
presume
this
is
a
fair
quotation,
the
authority
of
your
state
as
i
read
it
is
just
--
is
not
confined
to
a
violation,
it
indicates
that
your
officers
may
go
in
and
take
this
man
and
he
has
waived
the
taking
as
has
georgia
as
the
party
to
this
statute,
they
have
the
same
statute
and
you
may
--
he
may
be
produced
apparently
from
this
reading
for
any
purpose.
do
you
dispute
that
under
this
language?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
language
then
in
the
statute
that
says
the
decision
of
the
sending
state
to
retake
a
person
on
probation
or
parole
shall
be
conclusive
upon
and
not
reviewable
within
the
receiving
state?
doesn’t
this
indicate
that
this
is
your
man
and
whatever
your
reason
is
for
retaking
him
is
not
to
be
questioned
in
the
other
state?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
isn't
the
whole
the
purpose
of
this
statute
to
permit
some
flexibility
in
terms
of
sending
people
out
and
to
leave
with
the
committing
state
the
decision
as
to
why
they
revoked
it
as
though
he
were
within
the
committing
state?
you
would
not
deny
that
if
he
were
in
the
committing
state,
virginia
that
the
state
parole
board
could
respond
to
a
habeas
corpus
petition,
that
couldn’t
be
denied,
could
it,
if
he
were
in
virginia?
if
he
were
subject
to
the
authority
of
the
parole
board
in
virginia,
could
they
not
respond
to
the
petition
and
say
we
need
you
to
respond
to
the
habeas
corpus
and
we’re
here?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
other
words,
you're
saying
whether
in
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
virginia
or
in
georgia
it
would’ve
been
the
same.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
there
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
harp,
well
in
reference
to
the
question
put
by
the
chief
justice,
if
you
look
on
page
20
of
the
record,
but
doesn’t
it
also
say
you
are
placed
under
the
custody
and
control
of
the
parole
board.
what
--
how
do
you
interpret
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
isn’t
that
very
significant
then
if
the
statute
says
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
is
it
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
it
your
contention
mr.
harp
that
he
has
been
released
from
the
supervision
of
the
parole
board?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
he’s
under
supervision.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes
and
isn’t
--
since
he
is
under
supervision,
isn’t
he
in
custody
of
the
parole
board?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
isn't
that
what
statute
says
then?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
is
he
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
should
you
--
mr.
harp,
should
you
require
a
man
to
make
an
election
that
would
forgo
a
constitutional
right?
all
this
rule
seems
to
indicate,
i'm
looking
at
it,
49
is
that
you
go
to
court
so
that
the
court
can
make
an
appropriate
substitution
order,
is
that
the
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes.
well,
then
take
your
case,
you
have
a
parole
board
that
could
be
substituted.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that’s
on
judge
sobeloff
and
the
court’s
reading
of
prior
decisions
of
this
court
which
you're
now
arguing,
isn’t
that
correct?
