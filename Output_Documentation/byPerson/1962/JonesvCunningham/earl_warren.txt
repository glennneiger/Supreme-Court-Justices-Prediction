john
r.
jones,
petitioner,
versus
w.
k.
cunningham,
superintendent
of
virginia
state
penitentiary.
mr.
meador.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
court
deny
him
permission
to
substitute
the
parole
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
harp.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
state
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
the
state
oppose
the
motion
for
substitution
of
the
parties?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
--
are
you
depending
whether
it
should
have
been
granted?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
released
by
the
parole
board?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
can
the
--
the
parole
board
has
no
custody
over
him
in
prison,
has
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
--
by
release
--
by
release
you
meant
when
they
permitted
him
to
go
to
georgia,
they
released
him,
is
that
what
you
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we’ll
recess
now.
[recess]
mr.
harp,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
just
don’t
understand
[inaudible]
argue
the
issue
of
restraint
without
the
issue
of
asserting
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
far
as
the
rules
of
probation
as
i
understand
it
is
reasonable
or
not,
are
the
restraints
that
are
under
this
part
in
custody
of
the
--
under
georgia
law?
and
in
the
hearing,
he
says
that
the
order
didn’t
give
a
direction
of
the
parole
board
that
you
are
hereby
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
wherein
does
the
state
of
virginia
apply
this
--
in
time
that
case
prosecuted
to
a
conclusion.
is
it
just
because
the
man
is
on
probation
instead
of
being
a
prisoner?
why
is
that
a
hardship
on
the
state
and
should
there
be
any
distinction
insofar
as
the
man
being
able
to
wipe
out
an
unconstitutional
conviction
based
upon
whether
he
is
in
jail
or
out
of
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that’s
a
--
that’s
in
entirely
--
that’s
not
a
legal
right.
chief
justice
earl
warren
it’s
not
a
legal
right.
that’s
a
very
highly
discretionary
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
it’s
the
governor’s
obligation
to
give
anybody
a
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
man,
he’s
on
probation,
is
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
i
understand
here
that
the
--
from
this
order,
that
“you
are
placed
under
the
custody
and
control
of
the
virginia
parole
board.
the
parole
board
may
at
any
time
extend
your
period
of
parole.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
later,
march
10,
of
1964
that
the
board
obtained
the
right
to
extend
it
indefinite.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
don’t
think
that’s
any
restraint
upon
the
man
to
give
a
--
to
have
a
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
have
you
read
the
brief
of
the
other
side?
chief
justice
earl
warren
every
one
of
them
are
people
in
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
didn’t
have
parole
in
the
old
days?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
statute
says,
he
shall
remain
on
the
custody
of
the
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
does
the
--
how
does
the
parole
board
interpret
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
parole
board
says
at
page
20
of
the
transcript,
you
are
placed
under
the
custody
and
control
of
the
virginia
parole
board.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
says,
this
is
in
the
record
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
[inaudible]
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean,
they
took
--
they
take
him
out
of
jail?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
you
said
that
it
would
make
no
particular
indifference
if
he
was
in
the
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
i'm
sorry.
if
he
was
in
virginia,
would
he
then
be
in
custody?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
that’s
what
i
thought.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
--
you
have
a
few
moments
if
you
want
to
sum
up.
i
took
a
lot
of
your
time,
you
may
do
it
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
about
two
or
three
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
meador.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
meador,
before
you
leave,
i
would
like
to
express
the
appreciation
of
the
court
for
you
having
accepted
this
assignment
to
represent
this
indigent
defendant.
obviously,
you
and
your
associate,
worked
very
diligently
on
it.
we
appreciate
your
help.
mr.
harp,
we
also
appreciate
the
earnest
and
the
way
that
you
represented
the
state.
