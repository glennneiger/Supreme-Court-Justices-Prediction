mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
facts
as
outlined
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner
in
the
case
at
bar
are
roughly
correct.
it
would
seem
to
me,
however,
that
there
is
one
constitutional
infirmity
in
the
petitioner’s
conviction
which
has
not
been
discussed
by
professor
meador
and
that
is
the
fact
that
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
chewning
versus
cunningham,
his
recidivist
sentence
is
invalid
because
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel
at
that
time,
but
that
i
think
is
immaterial.
the
--
this
case
hinges
on
the
scope
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
that
is
the
whole
point
that
i
think
that
we
have
before
this
honorable
court.
beginning
on
page
5
of
our
brief,
we
have
outlined,
succinctly
we
hope,
our
understanding
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
the
fact
that
an
order
for
it
to
lie,
the
man
must
be
a
prisoner.
and
we
rely
on
mcnally
versus
hill,
we
have
cited
some
language
in
that
case
on
page
7
of
our
brief
and
i
would
like
to
read
to
you
that
a
portion
thereof
which
i
think
is
particularly
pertinent.
this
court
said
the
writ
in
its
historic
form
like
that
now
in
use
in
the
federal
courts
was
directed
to
the
disposition
of
the
custody
of
the
prisoner.
it
commanded
the
officer
to
have
the
body
of
him
taking
in
our
prison
under
your
custody
together
with
the
day
and
cause
of
his
being
taken
and
detained.
now,
under
what
wild
stretch
of
whose
imagination
can
a
superintendent
of
the
virginia
state
penitentiary
produce
this
man
before
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
let
us
assume
for
purposes
of
argument
that
the
court
should
hold
that
the
writ
does
lie,
that
the
case
would
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
court
should
hold
that
he
is
entitled
to
his
immediate
release.
that
mr.
cunningham
would
then
be
served
by
united
states
marshal
with
the
order
to
release
john
r.
jones.
the
best
mr.
cunningham
could
do
with
that
order
is
witness
files
because
mr.
jones
is
not
long
--
is
no
longer
in
the
custody
of
the
superintendent
and
has
not
been
in
the
custody
of
superintendent
being
in
the
state
penitentiary
since
june
26,
1961.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
but
i
--
may
i
reach
that
in
just
a
second,
sir?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
thank
you,
sir.
so,
that
is
the
situation
with
the
present
respondent.
there's
nothing
that
w.
k.
cunningham,
jr.,
the
superintendent
of
our
state
penitentiary
can
do
relative
to
john
r.
jones.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
now,
in
answer
to
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
we
filed
no
responsive
pleading
thereto
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
i'm
of
this
opinion
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
had
been
advised
of
the
contents
of
the
rules
of
the
fourth
circuit
or
the
contents
of
the
rule
of
this
court
relative
to
disturbing
the
custody
of
a
prisoner,
49(1),
i
believe
it
is
of
the
rules
of
this
court,
sir.
i
would’ve
--
alright,
i
didn’t
know
anything
about
it.
i'm
frank
to
say
this.
at
the
time
that
the
--
i
was
advised
of
the
parole
which
was
about
10
or
12
days
before
the
case
was
to
come
up
for
argument.
i
would’ve
then
said
to
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
“you
must
elect
your
remedy
because
we
will
not
parole
him
and
we
have
not
paroled
anybody
since
this
time,”
but
that
rule
was
not
called
to
my
attention
at
the
time
of
the
argument
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
fourth
circuit.
it
did
not
come
to
my
attention
into
a
memorandum
were
filed
at
a
later
date
and
consequently,
i
was
not
advised
of
it.
and
since
that
date,
we
have
not
paroled
anybody
who
has
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
pending
in
the
federal
system
or
on
certiorari
from
our
supreme
court
of
appeals
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case,
sir.
because
our
--
i’ll
reach
that
point
in
a
moment
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
but
if
we
had
--
assume
for
the
purposes
of
argument
sir
that
the
motion
had
been
granted
and
the
board
of
our
--
virginia
board
of
parole
had
been
substituted
as
a
party
respondent
to
the
proceedings,
then
--
and
in
the
meantime
now,
the
man
would’ve
been
released
on
parole
when
he
was
delivered
into
the
custody
of
the
superintendent
of
the
virginia
state
penit
--
of
the
--
from
this
custody
of
the
superintendent
of
the
penitentiary
into
the
custody
of
the
parole
board
in
conformity
with
section
53-264
of
the
code
of
virginia.
then
he
was
released
by
the
parole
board.
so
even
if
they
had
made
the
parole
board
a
party
respondent
and
substituted
him
in
place
of
the
superintendent,
i
don’t
think
that
it
would
have
made
any
susceptible
difference
in
the
case
insofar
as
our
view
is
concerned
because
the
man
has
been
released
by
the
parole
board
and
that’s
what
is
--
it’s
an
order
of
release.
that’s
what
he
has
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
he’s
been
released
by
the
parole
board.
he’s
delivered
into
the
custody
of
the
parole
board
and
that
he
was
released
into
--
to
go
to
georgia
under
the
uniform
act.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir.
they
have
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
what
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
under
the
statute
sir,
the
director
of
the
department
of
welfare
and
institution
who
runs
our
whole
penal
suits,
the
overall
overseer
in
general
and
handles
other
matters
too
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
must
under
virginia
law
when
directed
by
the
parole
board
release
any
prisoner
confined
in
the
penal
system
to
the
parole
board
and
then
the
parole
board
releases
him.
he
releases
him
from
custody.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
that
is
the
order.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir,
it
does.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
--
its
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
they
can
put
him
--
call
him
back
in
the
penal
system,
give
him
a
hearing
and
then
if
they
determine
to
revoke
his
parole,
then
he
is
turned
back
over
the
superintendent.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
wouldn’t
call
it
conditional,
sir
in
the
sense
i
think
that
you're
using
the
word.
i
would
say
that
he’s
been
released
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
subject
to
certain
conditions
with
the
hope
and
idea
that
he
won't
come
back.
that’s
the
whole
principle
of
parole,
sir.
now,
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
now
that
we've
gotten
over
into
the
parole
aspect
of
this
situation,
yes,
the
parole
board
can
reach
down
into
georgia
and
bring
this
man
back
into
virginia
and
give
him
a
hearing.
let’s
assume
that
they
find
him
with
a
--
let’s
assume
that
he
commits
a
breach
of
his
parole
conditions
and
the
parole
board
in
--
on
reading
the
reports
from
the
georgia
authority
say,
“we
don’t
know,
but
this
looks
like
a
right
bad
situation”
and
the
parole
authorities
in
the
state
of
georgia
recommend
that
he
be
--
that
his
parole
be
revoked.
so,
we
send
a
warrant,
we
have
sent
out
--
sent
a
warrant
out
for
him,
bring
him
back
and
then
he
is
granted
a
hearing
before
the
parole
board.
and
the
parole
board
then
reaches
the
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
his
parole
should
be
revoked.
and
quite
often,
they
decide
that
the
parole
should
not
be
revoked
and
then
in
other
times,
of
course
they
reach
the
opposite
conclusion.
but
there's
no
way
under
in
a
--
in
further
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question,
there's
no
way
that
i
know
of
that
this
man
can
be
brought
back
by
the
parole
board
if
they
had
been
substituted
as
party
res
--
parties
respondent
for
a
habeas
corpus
hearing.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
wouldn’t
want
to
have
to
try
the
habeas
corpus
case
in
the
state
of
georgia
sir
on
behalf
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
because
i
think
i’d
lose.
i
don’t
think
that
you
can
just
--
i
don’t
think
under
the
act
as
i
read
it
that
this
means
that
if
we
decide
that
this
man
should
wear
green
ties
and
he
won't
wear
them,
we
can
get
down
there
and
pick
him
up
to
bring
him
back.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i'm
trying
to
--
that
the
whole
act
is
printed
sir
in
our
appendix
and
i've
been
trying
to
find
the
section.
if
you
look
on
page
3
of
the
blue
--
rather
on
page
6
of
the
blue
brief,
you’ll
see
the
entire
section.
and
that’s
what
i
wanted
to
check.
it’s
on
page
6
of
our
appendix
sir
and
it’s
the
third
paragraph.
i
think
that
--
that
means
this
sir
that
if
we
have
to
go
in
there
with
a
justifiable
reason,
we
can
retake
him.
i
think
that
if
you
wanted
to
assume
that
we
were
arbitrary
and
capricious,
yes
sir,
i
think
so.
and
we
could
go
in
under
the
statute
and
just
pick
him
up
and
bring
him
back,
but
i
don’t
think
we
can
assume
that,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
don’t
think
so,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
oh,
i
don’t
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference.
he
is
not
in
custody,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
you
will
recall
in
answer
to
the
question
from
mr.
justice
goldberg
at
the
--
just
before
the
luncheon
recess,
i
pointed
out
that
even
if
the
virginia
parole
board
had
been
substituted
as
parties
respondent
in
a
habeas
corpus
action
pending
in
a
state
court
and
that
this
man
was
in
fact
a
parolee
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
in
virginia,
that
habeas
corpus
would
not
lie
if
our
understanding
of
our
habeas
corpus
statutes
are
correct.
now,
passing
on
then
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct.
now,
if
we
may
turn
just
for
a
moment
to
the
conditions
of
parole
and
take
a
look
at
the
situation,
i
think
that
is
important.
the
picture
i
think
painted
by
--
in
the
petitioner’s
brief
is
a
very
dark
one
of
mr.
jones’
situation.
granted
he
is
required
to
remain
within
the
general
community
area
of
this
town
wherein
he
has
chosen
to
go.
he
wasn’t
told
to
go
there.
this
is
where
he
wanted
to
go.
he
is
not
supposed
to
have
firearms,
well
this
is
a
reasonable
regulation
i
think
for
a
parolee.
he’s
not
supposed
to
violate
the
law,
well
neither
is
anybody
else,
but
the
parole
board
is
not
going
to
pick
him
up
and
have
him
locked
in
jail
just
on
some
odd
thought
at
an
odd
moment.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
without
the
permission
of
his
parole
officer,
sir.
the
reason
behind
that
being
that
the
fabulous
36-month
time
payment
plans
that
are
available
for
the
purchase
of
motor
vehicles
and
the
possibility
of
his
getting
in
financial
difficulty
because
of
that
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
but
that
is
not
logical
nor
--
i
mean
the
parole
officer
is
not
going
to
come
around
midnight
looking
for
him.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
--
we
have
to
take
i
think
a
reasonable
view
of
these
regulations
sir
and
assume
that
they
are
going
to
be
reasonably
applied.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i'm
not
sure
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
understand.
i'm
not
sure
--
for
instance,
you
take
a
counsel
standing
before
this
bar.
i'm
under
right
severe
restrictions.
i
have
to
appear
in
this
court
today,
i
have
to
appear
another
court
tomorrow.
i
will
be
in
three
courts
before
the
next
monday
in
different
sections
of
the
commonwealth.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
sometime
the
traveling
is
sir.
it’s
a
long
way
from
richmond
to
marion
where
i'm
going
next
sunday.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
he
didn’t
have
to
take
his
parole.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir,
i
would
not.
i
have
a
right
hard
time
commuting
it
but
he
may
move
his
residence.
all
he
has
to
do
is
ask
his
parole
officer.
he’s
changed
jobs.
we’ve
noted
that
in
his
brief
and
the
latest
parole
report
indicates
that
he’s
now
married.
so,
it’s
just
a
question
of
asking
his
parole
officer,
“may
i
do
these
things?”
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
sir?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
well,
there
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
may
be
some
merit
in
it.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct.
my
disagreement
with
mr.
meador
is
i
think
that
the
tenor
of
approach
which
he
takes
is
sort
of
painting
a
black
picture
of
the
situation
and
i
think
the
answer
to
it
--
to
this
man’s
present
situation
is
contained
in
the
order
of
release
and
we've
quoted
a
portion
of
it
on
page
12
of
our
brief
and
i
should
read
it
to
the
court
because
i
think
it
is
the
situation.
“the
parole
board
has
released
you
on
parole
because
it
believes
that
you
will
be
sincere
in
your
efforts
to
live
up
to
the
above
conditions
and
thus
benefit
yourself
as
well
as
the
community.”
i
call
you
attention
to
the
fact
that
he
has
been
released.
he
is
not
custody
in
the
contemplation
of
the
parole
board.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
--
that
is
done
because
that’s
what
the
statute
says
must
be
done
in
order
to
get
him
out
of
the
custody
of
the
superintendent
of
the
virginia
state
penitentiary.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir.
it's
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
purely
a
bookkeeping
transaction
when
you
get
down.
in
other
words,
we
take
this
man
off
of
our
headcount
if
you
want
to
use
the
vernacular
of
the
penal
authorities.
he’s
removed
from
the
headcount.
he’s
turned
over
to
the
parole
board
who
then
released
him
and
he’s
wiped
off
the
books
of
the
penal
system
as
such.
he’s
no
longer
in
the
penal
system.
he
is
now
without
the
confines
of
the
penal
system
and
he
has
been
released
by
the
parole
board
under
their
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
supervision.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir.
alright,
he’s
released
to
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
the
supervision
of
the
parole
board.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir.
he
is
not.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that’s
--
no,
sir.
it
does
not
say
that.
the
statute
releases
him
under
the
custody
of
the
parole
board
and
the
parole
board
by
its
own
order,
a
portion
to
which
i
have
just
read
to
this
honorable
court
releases
him.
now,
if
we
may
turn
then
for
a
moment
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
he
releases
him
from
behind
the
bars
if
you
want
to
take
it
that
far
from
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir,
but
he
is
released
in
the
vernacular
of
the
prisoners
to
the
street.
in
other
words,
he
is
out.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
and
no.
i
think
that
is
one
point
that
i’d
like
to
come
to
the
second
point
if
i
may
sir
and
that
is
this,
and
under
the
provisions
of
rule
49(1)
of
this
court,
the
custody
of
a
prisoner
is
not
supposed
to
be
disturbed
because
if
the
custody
is
disturbed
it
becomes
moot
and
that’s
what’s
happening
in
this
case
as
far
i'm
concerned
if
my
understanding
of
this
rule
be
correct.
now
i
may
be
wrong
but
this
situation
has
arisen
and
it’s
a
confusing
one
to
us
and
we
need
the
advice
of
the
courts
certainly
regardless
of
the
decision
in
this
case
because
we
are
faced
with
this
situation.
there
are
pending
at
the
present
time
approximately
117
habeas
corpus
cases
involving
virginia
prisoners,
roughly
as
of
the
first
of
last
month
or
the
middle
of
last
month.
a
number,
a
portion
of
these
cases
are
on
certiorari
to
this
court.
are
there
over
--
a
few
of
them
are
in
the
federal
system,
on
the
federal
side
completely.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
now,
does
this
mean
that
while
a
man
has
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
grinding
its
way
through
the
judicial
processes
that
he
--
that
we
can’t
parole
him.
i
don’t
know,
but
i
have
advised
our
parole
board
that
i
don’t
believe
that
they
can
parole
him
because
of
this
rule
of
court,
rule
of
this
court
as
well
as
the
rule
of
fourth
circuit
without
permission.
and
i
think
that
the
situation
then
is
this
insofar
as
we
are
concerned,
we
feel
and
i’d
always
thought
that
he
could
go
ahead
and
--
if
he
had
a
petition
or
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
going,
in
process,
if
he
--
if
the
parole
board
wanted
to
grant
him
parole,
certainly
he
was
entitled
to
be
turned
loose.
if
we
had
adopted
any
other
procedure
in
this
case,
this
man
would
still
be
in
the
penal
system.
he
would
not
--
he
was
been
out
for
about
18
months.
he
would
not
be
working
in
georgia.
he
would
not
be
married
and
he
would’ve
suffered
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
a
great
detriment.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
--
because
he
was
not
out.
so,
if
the
situation
then
we
asked
is
this,
may
we
parole
him
out?
we
may
parole
him
and
i
don’t
believe
so
under
this
rule
of
court.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes
sir.
if
the
court
would
give
us
an
order
releasing,
permitting
us
to
release
him
but
we
think
that
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
would
think
that
they
would,
sir.
but
my
question
is
this,
can
we
not
require
him
to
elect
his
remedies?
i
mean,
this
is
what
i
say
is
carrying
water
on
both
shoulders,
to
use
a
vernacular.
he
is
taking
all
of
the
benefits
that
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
will
give
him,
every
benefit
possible.
we
think
he’s
been
rehabilitated.
we
think
he
should
be
released.
we
put
time
and
money
into
this
man,
time
and
money,
trying
to
rehabilitate.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
if
you
get
somebody
to
substitute.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
don’t
think
they
could.
i
mean,
we
would
--
if
let
us
assume
that
--
well,
this
is
what
happened
in
the
fourth
circuit
very
recently.
the
man
had
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
going
and
it
turned
out
that
he
could
be
released
on
parole
and
i
told
the
man’s
attorney
this.
i
said,
“if
you
want
to
turn
him
loose
on
parole,
it’s
perfectly
alright
with
us
but
we’re
not
going
to
release
him
as
long
as
he’s
got
this
matter
pending
in
the
fourth
circuit
because
i
think
this
rule
means
that
we
can’t
turn
him
loose.”
and
the
--
that
judge
sobeloff
of
that
court
said,
“well
of
course,
if
he
is
paroled,
it
becomes
moot,
but
we’ll
let
you
--
we’ll
dismiss
the
action
then
he
can
be
paroled,”
which
is
what,
happened.
but
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes.
but
this
matter
came
up
within
the
past
couple
--
came
up
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
end
of
september,
early
part
of
october,
sir,
but
this
rule
i
think
makes
the
proceeding
moot
in
and
of
itself.
moreover
as
i've
said
before,
i
think
that
the
court
--
i
think
rather
that
the
petitioner
should
be
required
to
elect
his
remedies.
now,
i'm
not
saying
it
should
be
denied,
the
right
to
parole.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
he
must
do
one
thing
or
the
other,
to
use
a
vernacular,
fish
or
cut
bait.
he’s
either
got
a
constitutional
question
or
he’s
got
an
opportunity
for
release
and
i
think
he
can
weigh
them
and
decide
which
one
he
wants.
this
may
seem
harsh,
but
i
don’t
think
that
it
is
because
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
at
these
things
from
a
practical
standpoint,
from
a
standpoint
for
the
benefit
of
the
man.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
he
has
ultimate
remedies
to
wipe
out
an
unconstitutional
conviction.
he
has
ultimate
remedies,
sir.
if
he
has
an
unconstitutional
conviction
which
is
clearly
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
all
he
has
to
do
is
apply
to
the
governor
of
virginia
for
a
pardon
and
then
get
one,
and
they
give
one
very
swiftly.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
it's
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
i
understand
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct,
but
i've
never
seen
him
turn
one
down
yet,
the
present
governor
or
the
past
two
governors
under
whom
i
had
served,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
would
depend
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
in
gideon
versus
cochran,
sir,
which
is
now
pending
before
this
court.
he
was
tried
without
an
attorney
in
the
circuit
court
of
chesterfield
county,
sir
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
he
waived
his
constitutional
rights.
since
1950,
we
have
required
the
appointment
of
counsel
on
all
cases,
but
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
a
man
has
to
got
to
be
represented
by
counsel
in
every
case
which
is
what
he
have
required
for
over
10
years
whether
he
wants
to
be
or
not
and
we've
had
some
that
did
not
want
to
be
that
we've
appointed
attorneys
for
them
and
if
he
applied
for
pardon,
he’d
get
one.
now,
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
is
the
commonwealth
prejudiced,
yes,
i
think
we
are.
i
think
there's
--
i
think
we’re
entitled
to
have
an
end
to
litigation
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it's
--
i
think
his
situation
is
--
he’s
on
parole,
he’s
out.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that’s
under
section
53-255,
your
honor.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
restraint,
yes.
i've
never
said
that
the
man
is
under
no
restraint,
sir.
all
i'm
saying
is
this,
that
under
the
writ,
in
order
for
the
great
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
lie,
the
man
must
be
in
custody
and
we
assert
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
sir?
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
is
correct,
sir.
he’s
--
that’s
the
purpose
of
the
writ,
to
produce
the
body.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir.
i've
read
it
and
i've
read
every
case
that
they
cited
in
there
sir.
every
--
113
of
them.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir,
they're
not
all
people
in
jail
but
they
couldn’t
find
anybody
who
was
on
parole
except
in
a
few
cases
where
the
statute
says
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
--
yes,
sir.
but
they
have
located,
if
the
court
please,
and
we
have
discussed
those
cases
commencing
on
page
13
of
our
brief.
they
have
located
some
cases
where
it
has
been
held
that
the
man
on
parole
was
entitled
to
the
writ
but
that’s
where
the
statute
says
that
the
parolee
shall
--
the
statute
says
the
parolee
shall
remain
in
the
custody
of
the
superintendent
or
the
warden
or
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
that’s
a
different
situation.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir.
it
says
he
shall
be
released
to
the
custody
over
the
parole
board
and
the
parole
board
releases
him.
and
it’s
a
--
i
mean,
its
--
that’s
my
interpretation
of
my
statute
and
i
may
be
wrong.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
the
parole
board
interprets
it
as
having
released
him.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
yes,
sir
and
i
thought
i
had
explained
that
sir
and
i
may
not
have
been
as
succinct
and
clear
as
i
attempted
to
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
this
is
an
order
that’s
directed
not
only
to
john
r.
jones
but
to
the
superintendent
of
the
penitentiary.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that’s
right.
and
it
goes
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that’s
right.
well,
i
can
--
you
will
find
sir
that
this
is
the
method
by
which
as
i
explained
before
we
turn
him
loose
from
the
penal
system
and
that
he
is
not
in
custody.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
we
turn
him
loose
in
the
penal
system,
yes
sir
that
the
parole
board
is
not
under
the
control
of
the
penal
system.
it’s
a
separate
body
entirely.
it’s
a
three-man
board
appointed
by
the
governor
and
they
have
no
--
they're
not
controlled
in
any
way
by
the
penal
system.
now,
we
have
pointed
to
the
parker
versus
ellis
and
the
cases
cited
therein
where
this
court
has
held
that
when
a
man
is
released
from
custody
that
the
writ
does
not
lie.
we've
also
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
respondent
must
be
in
the
jurisdiction,
this
respondent
is
not
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
the
man
is
not
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
which
is
a
necessary
prerequisite
to
the
granting
of
the
petition.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no
sir,
i
did
not.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
no,
sir.
he
would
not
be
in
custody
and
the
writ
would
not
lie,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
that
--
that’s
my
understanding
of
it,
sir.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
if
i
might
--
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
oh,
i
thank
you,
sir.
in
summation
then,
we
would
say
this,
that
in
the
first
instance,
the
writ
only
lies
when
he
is
in
custody.
secondly,
even
if
he
were
to
or
rather
certainly,
under
the
present
situation
with
w.k.
cunningham,
the
superintendent
as
the
respondent,
the
writ
does
not
lie
because
he’s
not
under
custody
of
this
respondent.
if
the
court
below
was
in
error
in
failing
to
grant
the
motion
to
substitute
the
parole
board
and
if
this
court
should
grant
that
motion
then
even
if
the
parole
board
is
there,
the
man
is
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
in
other
decisions
of
this
court,
the
writ
does
not
lie.
now,
that
is
briefly
our
position
insofar
as
the
cited
cases
are
concerned.
moreover,
we
take
the
position
that
under
the
rules
of
this
court
and
the
rules
of
the
fourth
circuit
when
he
is
released
from
custody
and
he
is
released
from
the
custody
of
the
respondent
and
nobody
can
argue
with
that
and
we
can
get
into
it
--
to
a
differentiation
of
opinion
perhaps,
the
difference
of
opinion
as
to
what
the
virginia
statutes
mean,
but
the
--
under
the
rules
of
the
court
when
he
is
released,
he
is
released
and
he
is
released
from
custody.
the
matter
becomes
moot
under
rule
49(1)
of
this
court
and
that
is
briefly
our
position
and
the
premises.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
reno
s.
harp,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
