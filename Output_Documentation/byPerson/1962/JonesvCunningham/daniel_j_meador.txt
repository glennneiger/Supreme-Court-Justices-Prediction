mr.
daniel
j.
meador
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
habeas
corpus
case
which
has
been
dismissed
by
the
fourth
circuit
as
moot.
the
petitioner
who
is
a
state
prisoner,
had
been
placed
on
parole
while
his
appeal
was
pending,
and
the
court
below
considered
that
thereafter,
he
was
not
in
custody
within
the
meaning
of
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
prisoner
who
has
been
unconstitutionally
convicted
and
who
is
now
on
parole
is
to
be
denied
any
remedy
in
the
federal
courts.
in
urging
that
he
has
a
remedy,
the
petitioner
relies
on
two
propositions.
the
first
is
that
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
available
to
a
paroled
prisoner
because
he
continues
to
be
restrained
of
his
liberty
when
he
is
transferred
from
the
custody
of
the
penitentiary
superintendent
to
the
custody
of
the
state
parole
board
and
is
compelled
thereafter
by
the
board
to
live
in
a
particular
town,
in
a
particular
house,
to
work
only
at
a
designated
job
and
generally
to
confine
his
activities
to
those
things
which
the
board
directs.
the
second
proposition
is
that
even
if
habeas
corpus
is
held
to
be
inappropriate,
the
action
should
not
be
dismissed
but
should
be
treated
as
a
declaratory
judgment
action
and
the
constitutional
claim
thereby
adjudicated.
now,
if
it
please
the
court,
i’ll
leave
the
second
part,
the
declaratory
judgment
issue
to
the
brief
and
focus
discussion
here
on
the
habeas
corpus
question.
this
action
was
commenced
in
the
federal
district
court
for
eastern
virginia
in
february
1961.
at
that
time,
petitioner
was
confined
at
the
virginia
state
prison
farm
under
a
10-year
recidivist
sentence
which
is
the
same
sentence
under
which
he
continues
to
be
held
now
on
parole.
that
sentence
was
based
on
three
prior
convictions,
one
of
which
was
a
larceny
conviction,
a
conviction
for
larceny
of
an
automobile
in
1946.
in
the
petition
filed
below,
it’s
alleged
that
at
that
larceny
trial,
the
petitioner
--
petitioner’s
constitutional
right
to
counsel
was
violated.
it’s
clear
under
the
decisions
in
the
virginia
and
the
federal
courts
that
if
this
larceny
conviction
is
constitutionally
invalid,
the
recidivist
sentence
which
is
based
on
it
is
also
invalid.
petitioner
alleges
that
at
the
larceny
trial
in
1946,
the
petitioner
was
then
20
years
old
that
he
had
no
money,
he
had
no
lawyer,
he
was
not
told
that
he
was
entitled
to
counsel,
he
was
not
aware
that
counsel
could
be
appointed
for
him
and
that
he
did
not
waive
his
right
to
counsel.
the
state
in
its
return
filed
in
the
court
below
admitted
that
petitioner
was
not
represented
by
a
counsel
at
the
larceny
trial.
however,
the
state
put
forward
two
grounds
for
dismissal
of
the
petition.
one
was
that
the
petitioner
had
already
had
a
hearing
on
his
constitutional
claim
in
the
state
court
and
was
not
entitled
to
any
further
hearing
in
the
federal
court.
the
second
was
that
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
larceny
trial
in
1946
did
not
constitutionally
require
the
appointment
of
counsel
under
the
line
of
cases
stemming
from
betts
against
brady.
the
district
court
relied
on
those
two
grounds
in
dismissing
the
petition
without
a
hearing.
thereafter,
the
petitioner
took
steps
to
appeal
his
case,
still
representing
himself,
he
never
had
a
lawyer
up
to
that
point,
and
he
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit.
the
fourth
circuit
granted
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis,
granted
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
and
appointed
counsel
to
present
the
appeal
for
the
petitioner.
the
case
was
then
put
on
the
calendar
for
argument.
briefs
were
filed
by
both
sides.
the
day
before
the
case
came
on
to
argument,
june
1961,
the
respondent
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
appeal
on
the
ground
that
it
was
moot
since
the
petitioner
had
been
granted
parole
and
within
a
few
days,
he
would
be
released
from
the
state
prison
farm
on
parole.
attached
to
this
motion
to
dismiss
was
a
copy
of
the
parole
order,
the
order
issued
by
the
parole
board,
granting
parole
and
setting
forth
all
the
terms
and
conditions.
that
order
is
a
key
document
in
this
case
and
if
the
court
please,
i’d
like
to
call
its
attention
to
it
in
the
record
at
page
20.
the
order
is
backed
up
by
virginia
statutes,
one
of
them
specifically
requires
a
parolee
to
comply
with
all
terms
and
conditions
prescribed
by
the
parole
board.
now,
the
order
is
directed
to
the
petitioner
from
the
parole
board,
if
the
court
will
notice
on
page
20,
the
second
paragraph
of
the
order,
“you
are
placed
under
the
custody
and
control
of
the
virginia
parole
board.”
now,
there
is
a
virginia
statute
which
also
says
the
same
thing
in
effect.
it
says
the
--
a
parolee
is
in
the
custody
of
the
state
parole
board
and
i
mentioned
at
this
point
that
the
word
‘custody’
is
the
very
word
used
of
course
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
statute.
then
coming
to
the
middle
of
page
20,
the
last
long
paragraph,
there
that
12
general
conditions
set
out.
they
are
very
sweeping
and
broad,
some
of
them.
i
call
the
court’s
attention
particularly
to
condition
(f),
“do
not
leave
or
remain
away
from
the
community
where
you
reside
without
permission
of
your
parole
officer.
you
shall
not
change
your
residence
without
permission
from
your
parole
officer.”
condition
(h),
“you
shall
not
own
or
operate
a
motor
vehicle
until
you
have
received
written
permission.”
at
the
top
of
page
21,
the
general
condition
there,
condition
(l),
“follow
the
parole
officer’s
instructions.”
then
we
have
special
conditions
that
direct
the
petitioner
to
live
at
the
home
of
mr.
and
mrs.
mckinney,
his
aunt
and
uncle
in
lafayette,
georgia.
i’m
told
that
that’s
the
way
to
pronounce
locally.
he
is
directed
also
to
work
for
his
uncle,
mr.
mckinney,
a
plumber
and
so
on.
for
following
the
filing
of
this
motion
to
dismiss,
the
case
was
argued
in
the
fourth
circuit
on
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim
and
on
the
motion.
and
thereafter,
three
days
later,
the
petitioner
was
placed
on
parole
and
proceeded
to
lafayette,
georgia
where
he
has
remained
ever
since
under
the
terms
of
the
parole
order.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes,
sir.
petitioner’s
court
appointed
counsel
at
that
point
promptly
filed
a
motion
to
bring
in
the
members
of
the
virginia
parole
board
as
parties
to
the
case
on
the
ground
that
they
now
had
custody
of
the
petitioner
and
not
the
penitentiary
superintendent.
in
september
1961,
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
appeal
as
moot,
explaining
in
an
order
that
petitioner
was
no
longer
in
the
custody
of
the
originally
named
respondent,
superintendent
of
the
penitentiary
and
that
he
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes,
sir.
it
did
not
grant
petitioner’s
motion
to
bring
in
the
parole
board
members
and
it
held
that
he
was
not
in
the
physical
custody
of
the
parole
board.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
it's
only
in
the
course
of
the
opinion.
there
is
no
order
denying
that
motion.
it’s
clear
though
from
the
opinion
that
it
was
being
denied
in
the
--
it
wasn’t
granted
in
any
event.
thereafter,
this
court
granted
a
petition
for
certiorari,
limited
to
the
issue
of
mootness.
therefore,
the
merits
of
the
right
to
counsel
claim
are
not
here
today.
now,
petitioner’s
basic
contention
here
is
that
the
narrow
view
taken
by
the
court
below
as
to
the
availability
of
habeas
corpus
is
simply
out
of
line,
out
of
harmony
with
the
spirit
and
purpose
of
the
writ
and
the
historic
usage
of
the
writ
for
the
last
--
at
least
the
last
200
years.
the
test
of
the
availability
of
the
writ,
that
is
the
test
for
the
meaning
of
custody
in
this
context
which
is
really
synonymous
with
restraint
of
liberty,
the
test
is
not
close
confinement
or
physical
incarceration
or
imprisonment
behind
locked
doors.
the
test
is
whether
the
petitioner
is
deprived
of
the
freedom
to
go
when
and
where
he
would
otherwise
have
the
right
to
go.
that
is
whether
on
a
realistic
appraisal
of
the
facts,
the
petitioner
is
subjected
to
special
restraints
on
his
liberty,
on
his
mobility,
restraints
which
are
not
imposed
on
society
generally.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
no,
sir.
that
precisely
is
our
point
that
the
--
we
have
here
a
whole
array
of
restraints
to
which
the
citizen
generally
is
not
subjected.
a
citizen
generally
is
not
told
where
to
live,
where
to
work,
what
hours
to
keep,
persons
to
associate
with,
etcetera.
now,
it’s
true,
one
of
the
conditions
here
is
that
he
obey
the
law.
everyone
is
subject
to
that,
but
there
are
many,
many
others
here
to
which
citizens
generally
are
not
subject
to
and
even
that
condition,
even
the
condition
that
he
obey
the
law
has
consequences
here
that
are
not
ordinarily
present.
should
he
violate
a
municipal
ordinance
or
any
other
statute,
he
is
subject
to
rearrest
and
re-incarceration
without
any
further
trial
which
is
something
people
generally
do
not
live
under.
now,
our
proposition
is
that
restraints
within
the
formula
which
seems
historically
supportive.
restraints
may
be
imposed
in
a
great
variety
of
ways
other
than
by
locked
doors
and
prison
walls
and
the
parole
order
in
this
case
backed
up
by
the
virginia
statutes
makes
it
plain
that
this
man
is
circumscribed
realistically
by
a
great
array
of
restraints.
the
virginia
statutes
which
are
in
the
appendix
in
petitioner’s
brief
compel
this
man
to
obey
the
terms
of
the
order
or
be
subject
to
arrest.
he
may
be
arrested
with
or
without
a
warrant
for
violation
of
any
condition
which
includes
any
instructions
the
parole
officer
might
care
to
give
him.
and
upon
being
rearrested
he
may
be
re-incarcerated
without
an
order.
petitioner
really
is
in
a
twilight
between
the
penitentiary
and
freedom.
that’s
what
gives
rise
to
the
difficulty
in
this
case.
he
is
certainly
not
a
free
man.
however,
he
is
not
confined
in
the
penitentiary.
it’s
just
halfway
point
which
modern
penology
has
evolved,
gives
rise
to
this
difficulty.
however,
look
at
his
position.
his
entire
life
is
subject
to
official
supervision.
every
move
he
makes
is
merely
by
official
grace
and
by
official
sufferance.
people
with
whom
he
associates,
the
job
he
holds,
the
places
he
goes,
where
he
lives,
all
of
these
things
which
we
think
of
really
as
being
of
the
essence
of
freedom.
the
absence
of
these
things
is
what
we
associate
with
a
totalitarian
state,
police
state.
therefore,
when
a
man
in
our
society
is
deprived
of
these
things,
and
is
deprived
of
his
freedom
in
these
ways,
i
would
say
that
freedom
writ
--
writ
of
habeas
corpus
is
available
to
adjudicate
and
test
the
legality
of
those
restraints.
and
there's
nothing
novel
really
in
using
the
writ
for
this
purpose
and
to
test
the
legality
of
such
restraints.
in
our
brief,
we
have
set
out
numerous
examples
from
history,
some
modern,
some
old
in
which
people
have
employed
the
writ.
persons
illegally
inducted
into
the
army
have
brought
habeas
corpus
to
test
the
legality
of
the
induction.
children
in
custody,
the
legality
of
that
particular
custody
has
been
adjudicated
by
habeas
corpus.
these
people
are
not
physically
incarcerated.
they
are
not
prisoners
in
jail,
yet
they're
under
restraints.
the
apprentice
server
in
the
18th
century
had
available
of
the
writ
to
test
the
legality
of
the
indenture
under
which
he
was
held.
that’s
an
interesting
historical
incident
because
the
parolee
today
is
a
direct
descendant
of
the
old
indentured
servant.
the
indentured
servant
is
an
ancestor
of
the
parolee,
the
modern
parolee.
all
of
these
people,
parolees,
indentured
servants,
people
in
the
army,
children
in
someone’s
custody,
all
of
them
have
in
common
the
fact
that
they're
in
the
control
of
someone
else.
and
this
element
of
control
seems
to
be
the
key
here,
in
the
control
of
someone
else
under
special
restrictions
on
mobility
and
liberty
which
are
applicable
to
society
generally.
and
this
is
all
custody
means
in
the
habeas
corpus
statute
in
this
context
and
the
writ
is
not
tied
to
any
one
form
of
restraint.
it’s
not
narrowly
limited
to
prisoners
in
jail
and
with
all
due
respect,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
below
failed
to
take
adequate
account
of
this.
all
that
was
necessary
to
prevent
this
case
from
becoming
moot
was
to
bring
in,
enjoin
or
substitute
the
members
of
the
parole
board
in
place
of
the
penitentiary
superintendent.
the
parole
board,
the
members
of
that
board
and
now
the
officials
imposing
the
present
restraint,
they
now
have
petitioner
in
their
custody.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes,
i
would
say
those
are
--
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
yes,
i
could
say
two
or
three
things
about
it.
it
does
not
appear
that
there
was
any
motion
to
substitute
any
other
respondent
neither
does
it
appear
that
there
was
any
other
respondent
who
remained
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
where
the
habeas
corpus
action
was
commenced.
i
think
that
is
important
on
the
ex
parte
endo
and
other
cases
that
if
you
have
a
respondent
remaining
within
the
district,
even
though
the
petitioner
himself
has
been
removed
after
the
filing
of
the
petition.
mr.
daniel
j.
meador
on
the
first
point
that
there
was
no
other
respondent.
the
appropriate
respondent
there,
apparently,
would’ve
been
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
because
by
virtue
of
statute
he
has
custody
of
a
parolee.
it
would
be
my
impression
if
he
would
not
be
within
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
that
case
came
out
of
the
ninth
circuit.
i
don’t
know
the
district,
but
i
would
assume
he
was
not
within
the
reach
of
the
district
court’s
process.
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
any
motion
to
substitute
was
made.
moreover,
i
would
add
this
about
weber
and
squier.
it
was
a
denial
of
certiorari
on
a
stated
ground.
it
would
appear
that
by
having
granted
certiorari
in
this
case,
the
court
considers
the
question
not
necessarily
foreclosed
by
weber
and
indeed,
this
is
the
first
time
the
question
has
been
before
the
court
for
plenary
consideration.
so
all
in
all
i
would
consider
the
question
open.
the
parole
board
meets
another
requisite
for
a
habeas
corpus
respondent
and
that
is
that
it
has
power
to
produce
petitioner
in
the
federal
district
court
in
response
to
the
writ.
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
point
out
two
features
about
this
case,
one
is
this.
the
parole
board
itself
expressly
says
that
it
has
custody
of
the
petitioner.
the
virginia
legislature
also
expressly
says
that
the
petitioner
is
in
the
custody
of
the
parole
board.
so,
it
seems
that
the
state
is
hardly
in
a
position
here
to
say
that
the
board
does
not
have
custody.
the
state
can
hardly
deny
that
which
its
own
board
and
its
own
legislature
say
is
so.
now,
there
is
another
point
which
the
state
has
never
denied
in
this
case
and
cannot
deny
and
that
is
that
the
petitioner
still
today
remains
a
prisoner
of
the
state
of
virginia.
and
he
is
a
prisoner
under
an
unexpired
sentence
imposed,
so
he
asserts
and
with
considerable
merit
i
think,
in
violation
of
his
constitutional
right
to
counsel.
it
seems
to
me
clear
from
this
court,
in
congress,
and
our
legal
tradition
generally
that
a
man
in
that
position
is
not
to
be
left
wholly
