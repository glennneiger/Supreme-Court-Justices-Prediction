mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fortas,
you
haven't
had
an
opportunity
to
sum
up
your
argument
because
of
all
of
our
questions.
you
may
have
five
minutes
at
the
conclusion
to
do
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
the
state
may
have
five
extra
minutes,
too,
if
it
wishes
to
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
for
the
same
purpose.
mr.
rankin.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jacob.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
notice
some
interesting
figures
concerning
that
in
one
of
the
briefs.
i
think
it's
in
the
brief
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
they
show
that
in
--
no,
i
think
first
your
figures,
on
page
56
of
your
brief,
are
as
follows,
that
there
are
65%
of
all
of
your
prisoners
now
in
jail
were
not
represented
by
counsel,
65%.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
had
8,000
prisoners,
therefore,
5,200
prisoners
have
not
been
represented
by
counsel
in
the
trial
court.
and
then
i
noticed
also
that
ever
since,
in
all
the
time
following
betts
and
brady
up
to
the
present
time,
there's
only
been
one
decision
in
your
state
courts
finding
special
circumstances
under
betts
versus
brady.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jacob,
i
suppose
out
of
those
5,200
prisoners
now
in
your
jails
who
are
not
represented
by
counsel,
that
a
vast
majority
of
them
are
not
only
poor
but
are
illiterate.
would
that
be
a
fair
observation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
what's
your
observation?
chief
justice
earl
warren
some
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
even
if
they're
illiterate?
if
they're
poor
or
just
poor
and
illiterate,
you
think
they
always
give
them
a
lawyer
in
florida?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
do
they
--
as
a
general
rule,
give
them?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
they
try
to
find
out
whether
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
said
in
betts
versus
brady
that
they
must
furnish
counsel
in
all
capital
cases,
didn't
we?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
stating
the
rule
of
betts
versus
brady
as
you
understand
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
powell
along
with
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
you
believe
we
have
not
decided
that
in
all
capital
cases
he
must
be
supplied
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
suppose
the
judge
and
the
defendant
might
disagree,
though,
as
to
whether
the
judge
was
actually
helping
him
or
hurting
him
by
examining
witnesses
and
so
forth,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
would
he
ever
work
himself
out
of
that
dilemma,
if
he
couldn't
have
a
lawyer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
judges
ask
them
if
they
waived
counsel?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
mentz.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fortas.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
fortas,
before
you
sit
down,
i
should
like
to
say
this.
this
is
a
very
important
case.
it's
a
very
fundamental
case.
it's
important
to
the
state
of
florida,
to
the
state
of
alabama
and
the
other
states
that
have
that
same
rule.
it's
important
to
thousands
and
thousands
of
poor
litigants
throughout
our
country.
but
as
important
as
it
is,
i
can't
escape
the
feeling
that
in
many
of
the
cases
of
these
indigent
defendants
that
we're
talking
about,
problems
just
as
fundamental
and
just
as
important
as
this
arise
and
it
shows
what
benefit
we
do
get
from
counsel
in
deciding
those
issues.
i
want
to
say
that
we're
always
indebted
to
members
of
the
bar
who
are
willing
to
undertake
cases
of
this
kind
as
a
public
service,
and
we're
grateful
to
you
for
having
done
so
for
this
indigent
defendant.
we're
very
grateful
to
you,
general
rankin,
for
having
appeared
as
a
friend
of
the
court
in
the
same
cause.
and
of
course,
gentlemen
of
the
attorney
general's
offices
of
florida
and
alabama,
we
realize
the
great
burden
that
you
have
in
representing
your
state,
and
we
appreciate
the
fair,
frank
and
earnest
manner
in
which
you
have
represented
your
states
here.
we've
had
a
good
argument
and
we
thank
all
of
you.
