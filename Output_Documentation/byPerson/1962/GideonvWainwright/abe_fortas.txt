mr.
abe
fortas
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida.
in
issuing
the
writ
of
certiorari,
this
court
expressly
requested
counsel
to
discuss
the
following
question:
should
this
court's
holding
in
betts
versus
brady,
316
u.s.
455,
be
reconsidered?
the
question,
of
course,
is
the
right
of
accused
in
state
criminal
proceedings
to
the
appointment
of
counsel,
specifically
in
the
present
case
which
you
have
before
you,
the
question
is
an
exceedingly
narrow
one.
the
question
in
the
present
case
is
whether
requests
being
made
by
the
accused
that
counsel
be
appointed
to
him,
the
accused
being
concededly
indigent,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
state
to
accede
to
that
request
and
to
appoint
counsel
as
a
--
for
purposes
of
assisting
the
accused
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
in
other
words,
the
present
case
involves
a
trial,
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
it
involves
a
felony.
and
that
is
the
narrow
question
that
this
case
presents.
clarence
earl
gideon
was
convicted
by
the
state
of
florida
for
the
violation
of
a
statute
which
makes
it
a
felony,
unlawfully
and
feloniously,
to
break
and
enter
a
building
of
another
with
intent
to
commit
a
misdemeanor.
he
was
charged
with
breaking
and
entering
the
pearl
--
the
bay
harbor
poolroom
in
the
city
--
in
panama
city,
florida.
and
having
broken
and
entered
that
poolroom,
he
is
charged
with
having
extracted
some
wine,
perhaps
some
cigarettes,
and
a
sum
of
money.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
amount,
but
the
amount
must
have
been
less
than
$100
because
the
statute
of
the
state
of
florida
defines
petty
larceny
as
the
taking
of
goods
or
money
in
an
amount
less
than
$100.
at
the
commencement
of
the
trial,
the
court
asked
clarence
earl
gideon
if
he
was
ready
to
proceed,
he
said
he
was
not.
he
said
he
was
not
because
he
was
without
funds
and
without
counsel.
and
he
asked
the
court
to
appoint
counsel
to
represent
him.
as
you
will
see
on
page
2
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
the
court
replied
that
he
could
not
appoint
counsel
to
represent
a
defendant
in
a
noncapital
case.
whereupon,
the
case
proceeded
to
trial,
with
clarence
earl
gideon
doing
what
he
could
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
doing
what
he
could
to
defend
himself.
yes,
mr.
justice?
mr.
abe
fortas
that's
correct.
mr.
abe
fortas
no,
that's
correct.
if
you
--
you
will
also
see
on
page
2
of
petitioner's
brief
in
the
footnote
that
the
state
of
florida
concedes
that
the
allegations
in
the
habeas
corpus
petition
are
true.
namely,
that
petitioner
was
without
funds
and
without
an
attorney
at
the
time
of
trial,
that
he
requested
the
appointment
of
counsel
and
that
the
trial
court
failed
to
appoint
counsel.
you
will
see
that
quoted
on
page
2
of
our
brief.
mr.
abe
fortas
that
is
--
that
is
my
view,
yes.
i
must
say,
your
honor,
that
it
was
at
my
request.
the
transcript
was
not
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
i
was
coming
to
that
in
a
moment.
after
gideon
--
and
let
me
state
it
this
way.
after
gideon
was
convicted
and
sentenced,
several
months
later
he
sent
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
state
of
--
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida,
which
appears
in
this
transcript.
that
petition
cited
no
special
circumstances.
it
made
the
bald,
bare
claim
that
gideon
was
entitled
to
counsel
as
a
constitutional
matter
and
that
the
trial
court
refused
to
appoint
counsel
for
him.
and
on
that
basis,
gideon
asked
that
he
be
released.
the
supreme
court
--
there
were
no
supporting
affidavits,
there
was
no
supporting
information,
and
there
was
no
supporting
trial
transcript.
gideon
--
the
supreme
court
of
florida
denied
the
writ
and
dismissed
the
petition.
and
they
dismissed
it
without
opinion
without
hearing
or
without
reference
for
the
taking
of
testimony
whatever.
and
it's
from
that
denial
that
the
case
is
here
on
gideon's
application,
pro
se,
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
accordingly,
the
record
before
the
supreme
court
of
florida
consists
of
nothing
except
gideon's
old
application
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
after
the
case
came
to
this
court
and
this
court
granted
the
writ
of
certiorari
and
i
as
counsel
for
mr.
gideon,
requested
the
clerk
of
this
court
to
ask
the
florida
trial
court
to
certify
the
transcript
here.
i
did
that
because
i
thought
that
the
transcript
should
be
here,
that
the
court
should
be
--
this
court
should
be
completely
informed
as
to
what
had
happened.
that
the
attorney
general
of
florida
filed
a
motion
to
deny
my
request
that
the
transcript
be
sent
to
this
court.
that
motion
was
--
the
attorney
general's
opposition
was
turned
down
by
this
court.
my
motion
was
granted
and
the
transcript
was
sent
up
from
the
trial
court
directly
to
this
court.
the
attorney
general
of
florida
now
takes
the
position
that
the
transcript
is
not
properly
before
this
court.
we
disagree,
but
for
reasons
that
i
shall
come
to,
we
do
not
believe
that
makes
any
difference
whether
the
transcript
is
here
or
not.
we
believe
that
betts
against
brady
is
properly
raised
in
this
case
and
must
unavoidably
be
considered.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
i
see
no
basis,
or
as
--
i
do
not
see
an
adequate
basis
for
an
argument
that
special
circumstances
exist
in
this
case.
and
i
will
come
to
that
in
more
length
in
a
moment.
let
me
say
this,
if
the
court
please,
if
you
will
look
at
this
transcript
of
the
record,
perhaps
you
will
share
my
feeling,
which
is
a
feeling
of
despondency.
this
record
is
not
--
does
not
indicate
that
clarence
earl
gideon
is
a
man
of
inferior
natural
talents.
this
record
does
not
indicate
that
clarence
earl
gideon
is
a
moron
or
a
person
of
low
intelligence.
this
record
does
not
indicate
that
the
judge
of
the
trial
court
in
the
state
of
florida,
or
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
in
the
state
of
florida,
was
derelict
in
his
duty.
on
the
contrary,
it
indicates
that
they
tried
to
help
gideon.
but
to
me,
if
the
court
please,
this
record
indicates
the
basic
difficulty
with
betts
against
brady.
and
the
basic
difficulty
with
betts
against
brady
is
that
no
man,
certainly
no
layman,
can
conduct
a
trial
in
his
own
defense
so
that
the
trial
is
a
fair
trial.
mr.
abe
fortas
do
you
--
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
justice
harlan,
which
i
believe
to
be
the
case,
that
the
real
basis
for
betts
against
brady
is
the
following.
that
a
man
does
not
get
a
fair
trial
if
he
does
--
is
not
represented
by
a
lawyer,
but
that
the
demands
of
federalism
overweigh
the
absence
of
a
fair
trial.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
read
it
as
indicating
both,
but
of
course,
we
must
remember
in
reading
betts
against
brady
that
betts
against
brady
was
involved
a
trial
before
a
very
distinguished
jurist,
judge
bond
of
maryland,
and
it
did
not
involve
a
jury
trial.
but
it's
interesting
after
all
these
years,
mr.
justice
harlan,
to
read
the
recent
article
by
professor
kamisar
of
the
university
of
minnesota
in
which
even
in
betts
against
brady,
even
in
that
case,
trial
to
--
tried
to
a
judge
alone
and
not
to
a
jury,
and
tried
before
a
very
distinguished
judge,
the
record
--
the
record,
the
transcript
of
record,
as
professor
kamisar
shows,
is
replete
with
error.
and
the
case
that
he
makes
is
an
entirely
convincing
case
to
me,
just
as
in
gideon's
case.
there's
--
there
is
error
in
this
transcript.
there
is
error
in
most
criminal
trials.
i
think
we
all
know
even
where
lawyers
are
present.
there
is
error
in
this
transcript.
but
i
have
suggested
in
my
brief
and
i
hope
it's
not
a
gross
overstatement
that
--
to
say
that
this
transcript
distinguishes
this
case
from
the
run
of
criminal
trials
is
like
trying
to
distinguish
between
tweedle
dum
and
tweedle
dee.
and
i
believe
that
--
i
believe
that
this
case
dramatically
illustrates
the
point
that
you
cannot
have
a
fair
trial
without
counsel.
indeed,
i
believe
that
the
right
way
to
look
at
this,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
is
that
a
court,
a
criminal
court
is
not
properly
constituted,
and
this
has
been
said
in
some
of
your
own
opinions
under
our
adversary
system
of
law,
unless
there
is
a
judge,
and
unless
there
is
a
counsel
for
the
prosecution,
and
unless
there
is
a
counsel
for
the
defense.
without
that,
how
can
a
civilized
nation
pretend
that
it
is
having
a
fair
trial
under
our
adversary
system,
which
means
that
counsel
for
the
state
will
do
his
best
within
the
limits
of
fairness
and
honor
and
decency
to
present
the
case
for
the
state
and
counsel
for
the
defense
will
do
his
best
similarly
to
present
the
best
case
possible
for
the
defendant
and
from
that
clash
there
will
emerge
the
truth.
that
is
our
concept.
and
how
can
we
say?
how
can
it
be
suggested
that
a
court
is
properly
constituted,
that
a
trial
is
fair,
unless
those
conditions
exist.
someone
said
the
--
mr.
abe
fortas
that's
right.
now
that
--
and
that's
what
i
want
to
get
to,
mr.
justice.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
appreciate
that
and
i
am
happy
if
we
can
clear
the
debris,
if
i
may
say
so.
we
can
understand
exactly
what
is
that
issue
here.
and
i
just
want
to
say
and
to
nail
this,
if
i
may,
that
we
are
not,
and
we
cannot,
as
i
think
this
colloquy
has
disclosed,
mr.
justice
harlan,
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
any
such
thing
as
a
fair
criminal
trial
where
the
defendant
is
not
represented
by
counsel.
and
now,
i
would
like
to
get
to
the
question
of
federalism.
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
justice
douglas
--
mr.
abe
fortas
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
--
mr.
abe
fortas
mr.
justice
douglas,
it
seems
to
me
that's
--
perhaps
the
prop
--
that
--
i
would
state
the
proposition
in
this
way.
and
i
do
believe
that
it
is
a
proposition
that
proves
itself.
that
is
to
say
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
a
fair
trial.
you
cannot
have
a
fair
trial
unless
the
defendant
has
counsel.
now,
the
q.e.d.
to
me
is
so
obvious
that
i
can't
escape
from
it,
and
i
can't
escape
from
it
by
saying
that
the
q.e.d.
does
not
follow
because
of
a
principle
of
federalism.
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
a
fair
trial
and
we
say
that
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
proceeding
cannot
get
a
fair
trial
unless
he
has
counsel.
and
it
seems
to
me
to
follow
without
any
possible
escape
hatch
that
he's
got
to
have
a
fair
trial.
but
i
--
i
think
i
maybe
wrong
about
this,
but
i
do
believe
that
in
some
of
this
court's
decisions,
there
has
been
a
tendency
from
time
to
time
because
of
the
pull
of
federalism
to
forget
--
to
forget
the
realities
of
what
happens
downstairs,
of
what
happens
with
these
--
to
these
poor,
miserable,
indigent
people
when
they
are
arrested
and
they
are
brought
into
the
jail,
and
they
are
questioned.
and
later
on,
they
are
brought
in
these
strange
and
awesome
circumstances
before
a
magistrate,
and
then
later
on
they
are
brought
before
a
court.
and
there,
clarence
earl
gideon,
defend
yourself.
apply
them
the
doctrine
of
mapp
against
ohio.
construe
the
statute
of
the
state
of
florida
which
says
that
breaking
and
entering
with
intent
to
commit
a
misdemeanor
is
a
felony.
you
should
know,
clarence
earl
gideon
that
the
state
of
florida,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
florida,
has
construed
this
statute
and
it
has
made
available
to
you
various
defenses.
well
then
how
can
clarence
earl
gideon
do
it?
i
was
reminded
the
other
day
as
i
was
pondering
this
case
about
clarence
darrow's
trial.
court
will
remember
that
clarence
darrow
was
accused,
subsequently
acquitted
of
attempting
to
bribe
jurors
and
subordination
of
perjury.
and
i
looked
at
irving
stone's
book.
irving
stone's
book
says
that
the
first
thing
that
clarence
darrow
realized
was
that
he
had
to
have
a
lawyer.
he
was
a
man
who,
by
our
folklore
anyway,
and
i
think
perhaps
really
was
our
greatest
criminal
lawyer.
he
needed
a
lawyer.
he
got
a
lawyer.
he
was
eventually
acquitted.
but
i
think
that
in
some
of
the
court's
opinions,
if
i
may
say
so,
mr.
justice
harlan,
this
element,
this
failure
to
remember
what
happens
downstairs,
has
crept
in
not
because
of
an
insensitivity
of
the
judges,
but
because
of
the
understandable
pull
of
the
sensitivity
about
the
state's
own
jurisdiction
and
i
want
--
that's
what
i
want
to
analyze.
that
i
don't
think
that
it's
--
that
it
stands
a
test
of
logic
and
i
don't
think
that
the
argument
of
federalism
here
is
either
correct
or
soundly
founded
or
stands
the
test
of
experience,
and
that's
what
i
want
to
come
to.
now,
first
--
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
--
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
meant
that
a
regard
which
i
myself
share
for
the
principles
of
federalism.
but
i
believe
that
those
principles
are
misapplied
here.
first,
they
are
misapplied,
if
i
may
respectfully
say
so,
when
they
are
used
for
the
purpose
of
negating
a
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
a
fair
trial.
secondly,
they
are
misapplied
here
because
a
true
regard,
in
my
judgment,
mr.
justice
harlan
for
federalism
here
means
that
this
court
will
lay
down
a
principle,
will
establish
a
principle,
and
that
this
court
will
not
exercise
the
kind
of
minute,
detailed,
ex
post
facto
supervision
over
state
court
trials
that
you
have
been
exercising
for
these
past
years,
in
which
in
my
opinion,
is
the
most
corrosive
possible
way
to
administer
our
federal
state
system.
and
that,
it
is
i
--
--
i
should
like
to
restate
that
very
simply
and
very
plainly,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
betts
against
brady
does
not
incorporate
a
proper
regard
for
federalism.
i
believe
that
betts
against
brady
laying
down
as
it
does
a
prin
--
the
principle
of
case
by
case
supervision
by
the
federal
courts
of
state
criminal
proceedings
is
antithetical
to
federalism.
federalism
requires,
in
my
judgment,
if
your
honors
please,
that
the
federal
courts
should
refrain,
so
far
as
possible,
from
intervention
in
state
criminal
proceedings
and
certainly
at
where
intervention
is
necessary
because
of
a
constitutional
principle
that
that
intervention
should
be
exercised
in
the
least
corrosive,
the
least
aggressive
fashion
possible.
now
let's
take
a
look
at
that.
in
the
betts
against
brady,
we
have
to
start
back
with
that
magnificent
opinion,
magnificent
decision
and
opinion
of
this
court
written
by
mr.
justice
sutherland
in
powell
against
alabama,
and
the
scottsboro
case.
when
mr.
justice
sutherland's
opinion
makes
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
correct
principle
in
capital
cases
is
that
a
state
court
cannot
conduct
a
criminal
proceeding
without
providing
counsel
for
the
accused.
now,
this
court
has
said
that
that
is
a
flat
rule.
that
in
capital
cases,
this
court
does
not
stop
to
inquire
whether
there
are
special
circumstances.
counsel
must
be
appointed
for
the
accused.
that
was
in
1932.
in
1938,
along
came
johnson
against
zerbst,
in
which
this
court
construed
the
sixth
amendment
to
require
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
indigent
accused
in
all
federal
criminal
proceedings.
then
in
1942,
betts
against
brady
came
to
this
court.
and
in
betts
against
brady,
this
court
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
roberts
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
would
not
be
construed
to
require
that
the
state's
appoint
counsel
for
the
accused
in
all
criminal
cases
where
the
accused
is
not
able
to
afford
counsel,
but
that
counsel
would
be
required
as
part
of
the
fourteenth
amendment's
requirement
of
a
fair
trial
only
where
there
were
special
circumstances
or
to
quote
the
court's
words,
“only
where
there
has
been
a
denial
of
fundamental
fairness
shocking
to
the
universal
sense
of
justice”.
which
according
to
the
court,
required
something
more
than
the
mere
absence
of
counsel.
alright,
what
has
happened
in
the
years
since
betts
against
brady?
i
have
read,
i
think,
i'm
sure
i've
read
all
of
the
cases
that
have
come
to
this
court.
i've
read
a
great
many
of
the
state
cases
and
the
lower
federal
court
cases,
many
as
i
could
find.
it
is
a
fascinating
inquiry,
a
fascinating
inquiry.
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union
here,
which
is
represented
by
my
brother,
mr.
rankin,
they
have
examined
139
state
cases,
reported
cases.
they
say
that
they
have
found
only
11
cases
in
which
the
state
appellate
courts
found
special
circumstances
under
betts
against
brady,
contrast
that
with
what's
happened
in
this
court.
take
a
look
as
--
i
beg
your
pardon.
when
i
have
--
as
i
have
read
the
opinions
of
this
court,
i
hope
i
maybe
forgiven
for
saying
that
my
heart
has
been
full
of
compassion
for
the
judges
who
during
these
years
have
had
to
review
and
pass
on
these
cases.
most
of
the
time,
of
course,
this
court
has
said
there
are
special
circumstances.
sometimes,
a
majority
of
this
court,
usually
a
bare
majority,
has
found
that
there
were
not
special
circumstances.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
think
you're
right,
sir.
i'd
like
to
check
this
but
i
believe
the
last
case
in
which
you
failed
to
find
special
circumstances
was
--
mr.
abe
fortas
it
was
quicksall,
i
think.
well
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
now,
of
course,
this
is
wrong
and
it's
wrong
as
a
matter
of
federalism,
because
what
happens
is
the
following.
let's
take
a
look
at
it.
a
defendant
is
arraigned.
how
can
a
judge,
looking
at
the
defendant,
decide
whether
there
are
special
circumstances
in
his
case?does
a
judge
look
at
this
defendant
and
say,
“you
look
stupid.
you
look
as
if
you
are
a
moron.”
does
he
have
a
--
does
he
have
a
mental
examination
of
him
at
the
time?
does
the
judge
--
does
the
judge
or
the
magistrate
before
whom
these
defendants
are
arraigned
on
a
typical
day
in
court
take
a
look
at
the
crimes
with
which
they
are
charged
and
say,
“now
this
one
involves
complicated
questions
of
intent.
so
i
think
that
at
the
trial
you're
going
to
need
a
counsel.”
now
in
your
case,
the
crime
that
you're
charged
with
doesn't
look
to
me
to
be
so
complicated.
so
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
need
counsel.
now
let's
have
arraignment.
then
you
go
to
trial
and
the
defendant
--
the
accused
man
has
pleaded
not
guilty.
and
the
judge
who's
sitting
on
the
bench,
he's
hearing
a
lot
of
these
cases.
how
is
he
going
to
decide
at
the
beginning
of
the
case
whether
there
are
special
circumstances
within
the
criteria
laid
down
by
this
court?
the
interesting
thing
too,
according
to
the
study
made
by
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
they
have
not
encountered
a
single
case
in
the
state
courts
in
which
the
trial
has
been
stopped
in
midstream
and
the
court
has
said,
“there
are
special
circumstances
here
and
you
better
have
a
lawyer,
because
it
looks
to
me
that
you're
not
brighter
than
clarence
darrow,
or
you're
a
moron
and
you
can't
really
defend
yourself.
you
just
don't
correctly
understand
the
hearsay
rule.
i'm
going
to
appoint
you
to
counsel.”
the
whole
rule
is
just
totally
unadministerable.
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'd
like
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir,
and
there
are
37
states
now.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
don't
believe
they
have
done
it
so
much
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i'm
sorry
to
say.
i
believe
that
they
have
done
it
because
of
a
growing
conscience
and
growing
awareness
on
the
part
of
the
bar
stimulated
by
the
opinions
of
this
court.
but
the
decisions
of
this
court
--
and
this
is
precisely
my
plea
here.
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
still
struggling
with
this
impossible
question
of
do
special
circumstances
exist
in
this
case
or
don't
they?
whereas,
the
bar
and
the
states
are
far
beyond
that
point.
no.
there
is
a
brief
amicus
here,
a
remarkable
document,
filed
by
20
--
by
the
attorneys
general
of
22
states
urging
this
court
to
overrule
betts
against
brady.
it
is
filed
here.
i
am
proud
of
our
country
that
we
have
this.
it
was
not
solicited
by
counsel
for
cochran
or
by
counsel
for
gideon
or
anybody
associated
with
him,
and
i
am
proud
that
it
is
here.
it
is
a
fine
document.
if
you
will
look
at
that
document
at
page
--
i
don't
find
it
here.
mr.
abe
fortas
alright.
mr.
abe
fortas
thank
you.
the
attorneys
general
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
rule
of
betts
against
brady
is
an
unadministerable
rule.
i
call
your
attention
to
page
17
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
mr.
abe
fortas
that
is
this
brown
brief,
mr.
justice
black,
a
brief
for
the
state
government,
amici
curiae.
at
the
bottom
of
page
17,
it
says,
“but
it
is
difficult
to
comprehend
how
as
a
practical
matter,
a
trial
judge
can
do
this”
--
that
is
to
say
apply
betts
against
brady,
with
the
degree
of
consistency
presupposed
by
a
judicial
determination
placing
the
onus
of
such
decisions
upon
him.
in
the
first
place,
in
a
felony
case,
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
there
is
one
trial
judge
as
such.
different
judges
may
preside
at
the
arraignment,
at
the
grand
jury
session,
possibly
at
the
pretrial
motions,
if
any,
and
at
the
trial
itself.
how
can
the
judge
in
the
arraignment
session
anticipate
what
is
to
come
up
in
trial?
how
is
the
trial
judge
to
know
what
crucial
matters
transpired
at
the
arraignment
which
thenceforth
require
counsel,
and
so
on?
now
if
the
court
please,
there's
on
aspect
of
this
brief
amicus
curiae
to
which
i
want
to
call
your
particular
attention.
there
are
three
states
whose
attorneys
general
have
subscribed
to
this
which
do
not,
by
law
or
court
rules,
so
far
as
we
can
find
out
require
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
all
felony
cases.
those
three
states
are
hawaii,
maine,
and
rhode
island.
mr.
abe
fortas
colorado
has
recently
adopted
a
rule
of
court.
mr.
abe
fortas
that's
cited
--
mr.
abe
fortas
that
is
cited
in
our
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
that's
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
and
i
don't
know
of
the
circumstances,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
abe
fortas
that's
right.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
that's
correct.
yes,
sir.
so
i
believe
that
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
this.
i
think
that
the
--
we
can
confidently
predict.
we
can
confidently
say
that
overruling
betts
against
brady
at
this
time
is
acting
in
accordance
with
the
common
opinion
of
those
citizens
of
our
country
who
are
qualified
to
have
an
opinion.
that's
not
always
the
case
with
respect
to
great
constitutional
changes.
i
think
with
respect
to
this
one
that
is,
is
the
case
and
that
--
you
will
remember
that
in
betts
against
brady,
this
court
placed
some
emphasis
upon
the
fact
that
at
that
time
less
than
a
majority
of
the
states,
as
i
remember,
required
the
appointment
of
counsel.
that
is
no
longer
true
in
these
--
mr.
abe
fortas
no.
i
don't
--
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
i'll
find
that
in
just
a
minute.
mr.
abe
fortas
that
at
the
time
of
betts
against
brady,
there
were
less
than
a
majority
of
the
states
that
required
it
by
statute
or
court
rule.
now
i
should
say
that
presently
in
addition
to
the
37
states
that
require
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
indigents
by
a
statute
or
court
rule,
a
recent
study,
a
very
careful
study
by
a
professor
kamisar,
shows
that
there
are
eight
states
that
require
that
do
appoint
counsel
when
requested.
that
makes
a
total
of
45
states
that
appoint
counsel
either
by
a
statute,
court
rule
or
by
practice,
and
it
really
leaves
only
five
states.
and
of
those
five
states
--
those
five
states
are
alabama,
florida,
mississippi,
north
carolina,
and
south
carolina.
and
even
in
florida,
from
which
four
of
the
--
this
court's
last
eight
cases
have
come,
there
is
a
situation
that
is
worth
notice.
in
florida,
there
is
a
statute
providing
for
a
public
defendant
in
the
larger
counties.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
a
public
defendant
that
functions
in
the
four
largest
counties
of
florida
and
i'm
sure
you'll
hear
more
about
that
from
my
brother
representing
the
state.
so
that
my
point
here
is
that,
we
may
be
comforted
in
this
constitutional
moment
by
the
fact,
as
it
clearly
is,
that
what
we
are
doing
represents
a
deliberate
change
after
20
years,
after
20
years
of
experience,
and
it
represents
a
change
that
clearly
has
the
overwhelming
support
of
the
bench
and
the
bar
and
even
of
the
states
themselves.
mr.
abe
fortas
this
case,
of
course,
narrowly
presents
the
question
of
the
appointment
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
it
presents
--
narrowly
presents
the
question
of
a
felon.
in
my
own
view,
i
believe
that
the
requirement
that
counsel
should
be
appointed
for
indigents
in
state
criminal
proceedings
should
be
coextensive
with
the
proposition
that
persons
who
are
able
to
hire
counsel,
to
employ
counsel,
have
a
right,
a
legally
protected
right,
a
constitutional
right,
to
utilize
the
services
of
such
counsel.
now
we
all
know
that
the
scope
of
the
latter
principle
is
not
entirely
clear.
there
are
some
decisions
of
this
court.
there
are
many
aspects
of
the
problem
where
it
has
not
been
decided.
now,
let
me
cut
back
on
that,
if
i
may.
in
the
literature,
there
seems
to
be
clear
agreements
that
the
right
to
counsel
should
attach
not
later
than
the
time
of
arraignment,
and
this
brief
of
the
22
attorneys
general
reiterates
that
point.
in
other
words,
that
the
latest
point
is
the
time
of
arraignment.
mr.
abe
fortas
exactly.
mr.
abe
fortas
that's
correct.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
my
own
view,
mr.
justice
stewart,
is
that
there
is
a
right
to
counsel
as
soon
as
practicable
after
arrest.
mr.
abe
fortas
no,
sir.
we
do
not.
i
was
responding
to
mr.
justice
goldberg's
inquiry.
you
certainly
do
not
have
to
pass
on
it
here.
mr.
abe
fortas
there
are
some
just
in
the
district
of
columbia
of
petty
offenses
which
probably
don't
require
appointment
of
counsel.
the
--
in
the
question
--
with
respect
to
the
question
of
jury
under
the
sixth
amendment,
this
court,
in
a
case
that
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
coming
up
from
the
district
of
columbia
held
that
the
constitutional
requirement
of
the
sixth
amendment
with
respect
to
jury
trial
did
not
apply
to
petty
offense
which
in
that
case
involved
an
offense
punishable
by
imprisonment
up
to
90
days,
as
i
remember.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes
sir
but
you
will
recall
that
in
the
sixth
amendment
that
language
runs
together,
right
to
jury
and
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
don't
recall
one.
i
don't
recall
a
decision
of
this
court
on
that
subject.
but
it
does
--
but
there
is
this
case
involving
jury,
the
right
to
jury.
if
you'd
like
me
to
continue,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
would
--
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
i
would
say
that
the
right
to
counsel
attaches
as
soon
as
practicable
after
the
arrest,
just
as
i
believe
that
a
person
who
can
retain
counsel
should
have
recognized
the
right
to
consult
the
counsel
shortly
after
arrest.
here
we
have
a
problem
relating
to
crooker
against
california.
now,
as
to
the
extent
on
the
other
end,
this
court
has
held
that
the
states
must
supply
transcripts
to
indigents
for
purposes
of
enabling
the
indigent
to
perfect
their
appeal.
i
believe
that
the
right
to
counsel
also
attaches
for
purposes
of
perfecting
appeal
and
for
the
appeal.
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
not,
as
i
read
them,
going
quite
that
far
although
there
is
a
language
indicating
that.
now,
as
to
the
type
of
crime,
the
sixth
amendment,
of
course,
speaks
in
terms
of
criminal
prosecutions.
the
question
--
there
is
a
consensus,
i
believe,
that
the
right
to
counsel
should
be
recognized
in
felony
cases.
i'm
talking
now
about
the
states
and
that
is
the
provision
--
that
is
the
attitude
of
the
22
attorneys
general.
mr.
abe
fortas
it
does
--
mr.
abe
fortas
it
does
not.
it
has
a
--
there
is
an
area
in
which
the
word
is
very
fuzzy.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
and
then
--
that's
correct.
even
the
word
“misdemeanor”
is
a
fuzzy
word
which
does
not
have
a
common
meaning.
my
own
view
about
this
again
is
that
the
right
should
attach
on
a
much
broader
basis,
and
that
it
should
attach
to
all
except
petty
offenses.
and
i
think
this
court's
opinion
in
the
district
of
columbia
case
points
the
way
to
handle
that
particular
problem.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
mr.
abe
fortas
mr.
justice
brennan,
i'd
certainly
pay
no
attention
to
the
nomenclature
adopted
by
the
states.
you
can't,
because
the
(inaudible)
--
the
words
mean
so
many
different
things
in
the
states.
but
fortunately,
in
times
of
stress
such
as
this,
when
you
are
asked
to
confront
a
problem
of
this
sort,
we
lawyers
can
point
to
the
fact
that
a
straight
line
can
be
drawn
in
many
ways,
and
a
line
can
be
drawn
by
a
series
of
dots
represented
by
individual
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
abe
fortas
no,
because
what
we're
talking
about,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
the
extremes
of
this
problem.
now
a
good
many
of
the
states,
i
believe
it's
over
20,
one
list
shows
24,
one
list
shows
21.
a
good
many
of
the
states
had
required
the
appointment
of
counsel,
the
indigents,
include
misdemeanors
or
their
statutes
are
broad
enough
so
that
they
indicate
that
they
include
misdemeanors
under
the
laws
of
the
--
of
the
particular
states.
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
that
that
would
be
--
my
own
view
about
that,
mr.
justice
brennan,
is
that
one
day's
confinement
is
enough.
and
i
really
believe,
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
say
--
put
it
this
way,
i
really
believe
that
the
difficulties,
practical
difficulties,
which
we
can
envision
here
are
more
fancy
than
real.
and
i
think
our
experience
in
the
district
of
columbia
with
our
public
defender
here
indicates
that.
in
other
words,
that
when
a
state
goes
about
this
job,
as
your
state
of
california
has
so
well
done,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
as
i
hope
we're
doing
in
the
district
of
columbia.
what
it
does
is
to
set
up
a
system
by
which
persons
when
they
are
arrested,
without
nice
regard
to
whether
--
to
the
extent
of
punishment
or
the
classification
of
the
crime,
those
persons
are
told
that
they
can
go
and
see
the
public
defender
or
that
they
can
have
a
lawyer
appointed
for
them
and
the
system
works.
and
the
difficulties
are
much
greater
when
we
sit
here
and
apply
our
minds
to
the
problem.
mr.
abe
fortas
then
it
is
--
then
those
difficulties
are
when
we
sit
--
really
create
a
mechanism
for
handling
them.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
see
no
real
difficulty,
mr.
justice,
in
saying
to
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
people
for
a
traffic
when
they're
arrested
for
traffic
violation.
if
you
want
to
see
the
public
defender,
he's
in
room
102,
and
to
assign
a
public
defendant,
anybody
who
wants
it.
it
really
works.
it
will
work.
it
sounds
crazy,
perhaps,
but
it
work.
i'm
sure
it
will.
mr.
abe
fortas
well
i
--
more
and
more
states,
mr.
justice
clark,
are
building
orderly
systems
and
of
course,
one
of
the
great
functions
that
this
court
performs
by
announcing
the
law
and
clarifying
the
principles
of
law
is
to
provide
an
impetus
to
the
states
to
erect
such
systems
but
there
are
many
systems
that
are
now
available.
there
is
a
public
defender
system,
there
is
the
voluntary
legal
aid
system,
there
is
the
system
of
assignment,
there
is
a
system
that
is
in
vogue
here
in
the
district
and,
i
believe
in
massachusetts
which
is
very
promising
indeed
of
using
law
students
working
under
the
supervision
of
experienced
members
of
the
bar
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
for
handling
many
offenses.
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
i
--
again
--
mr.
abe
fortas
again,
mr.
justice
clark,
i
think
that
most
people
involved
in
traffic
offense
really
be
just
sort
of
the
--
if
i
may
use,
vulgarism,
the
“oddball”
who's
involved
in
a
minor
traffic
offense
who
will
say
that
he
wants
a
lawyer.
but
if
he's
got
a
real
problem
--
if
a
person
involved
in
traffic
offense
has
a
real
problem
and
a
real
defense
and
really
need
--
thinks
he
should
have
a
lawyer,
why
not.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
accept
that.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
would
just
like
briefly
to
address
myself
to
mr.
justice
black's
question
and
then
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
justice
black,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
has
been
any
retrogression
at
all
in
any
of
the
states.
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
as
to
some
of
the
statutes
in
cases
that
you
cite.
research
in
this
field
is
very
difficult
and
there
are
differences
of
opinion.
i
believe
that
in
professor
kamisar's
article
which
has
just
been
published
in
chicago
law
review,
a
companion
case
in
the
michigan
law
review,
there
is
a
discussion
of
your
footnote
and
some
criticism
of
some
of
the
citations.
now
--
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
now,
actually
here
is
the
position
as
well
as
i
understand
it
in
betts
against
brady,
in
the
majority
opinion
of
--
in
the
court's
opinion,
the
following
is
stated
quote,
“in
the
great
majority
of
the
states,
it
has
been
the
considered
judgment
of
the
people,
their
representatives
and
their
courts
that
appointment
of
counsel
is
not
a
fundamental
right
essential
to
a
fair
trial
and
in
the
majority
opinion
there
are
citations
and
analysis.”
now,
in
your
own
opinion,
mr.
justice
black,
on
page
477,
footnote
2,
i
think
it
is,
you
say
in
35
states,
there
is
some
clear
legal
requirement
or
an
established
practice.
mr.
abe
fortas
now,
this
--
could
we
just
hold
that
a
minute?
the
intervening
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
in
1961
in
mcneal
against
culver,
mr.
justice
douglas,
appended
a
list
of
35
states
which
were,
had
such
provisions
by
constitution,
statute,
court
rule
or
judicial
decision.
that
was
in
35
states
in
1961,
which
shows
a
growth
in
the
number.
now,
since
the
list
compiled
by
mr.
justice
douglas
there
have
been
two
others,
colorado
and
michigan.
you'll
find
that
on
page
29
of
our
brief,
which
makes
37
states
that
by
constitution,
court
rule,
statute
or
judicial
decision
make
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
indigents
in
the
state
criminal
prosecutions,
at
least
in
felony
cases,
compulsory.
now,
in
addition
--
mr.
abe
fortas
some
of
them
are.
there
are
about
20
or
more
that
include
misdemeanors,
of
those
statutes.
now,
in
addition
to
those
37,
there
are
eight
states
which
have
a
practice,
a
general
practice
--
not
invariable,
but
a
general
practice
of
appointing
counsel
in
state
felony
prosecutions.
they
are
listed
in
our
brief.
that
would
bring
you
up
to
a
total
of
45.
now,
the
remaining
five,
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
argument
--
florida,
for
example,
by
statute
and
apparently
by
practice
--
by
statute
in
the
case
of
two
counties
and
by
practice
in
the
case
of
two
others,
has
a
public
defender
system.
and
a
recent
study
made
by
the
american
bar
association
foundation
of
the
workings
of
that
system
in
those
selected
counties
in
florida,
it
shows
that
the
public
defender
system
is
extensively
utilized.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
yes,
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
in
my
opinion,
there
is
not,
your
honor,
but
i
am
concerned
about
--
mr.
abe
fortas
i
am
concerned
about
this
court's
decision
in
crooker
against
california,
which
was
a
five-to-four
decision.
i
was
asked
from
my
own
view,
and
in
my
own
view
--
and
i
hope
i'm
not
impertinent
in
saying
that
i
do
not
agree
with
this
court's
ruling
in
crooker.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
abe
fortas
i
was
speaking
only
of
criminal
cases,
your
honor.
i
was
not
speaking
of
civil
cases.
i
know
that
there
are
some
people,
but
very
few,
so
far
as
i
know,
who
argue
for
the
right
in
civil
cases.
i
do
not
argue
for
that
right
in
civil
cases,
at
least
the
broad
category,
what
we
think
of
as
civil
cases.
there
can
be
a
case
called
a
civil
case
in
which
the
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
state
is
a
party.
i
myself,
your
honor,
believe
that
that
is
the
significant
criterion
whether
the
state
is
in
an
adversary
capacity
in
the
particular
situation.
but
that's
another
problem.
and
i
am
not
arguing
the
civil
cases
here,
whatever,
no
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
no,
i
would
not
use
that
terminology.
i
believe
that
some
of
the
scholars
recently
are
using
the
terminology
of
“absorption,”
rather
than
“incorporation.”
that
is
to
say
that
from
time
to
time
the
--
it
becomes
clear
that
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
they
have
been
absorbed
certain
aspects
of
the
sixth
amendment.
but
i
do
believe
that
--
mr.
abe
fortas
sir?
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
like
any
of
those
words
though.
mr.
abe
fortas
absorption?
it
was.
that
is
correct.
and
it's
being
used
a
great
deal
these
days
in
the
spate
of
literature
on
this
subject.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
think
that
the
equal
protection
clause
teaches
us
something
here.
that
is
to
say,
you
can
say
that
equal
protection
means
that
the
indigents
in
a
situation
where
the
state
is
an
adversary,
a
criminal
procedure,
that
equal
protection
clause
requires
that
the
poor
shall
not
be
subject
to
a
disability
to
which
the
rich
are
not
subject.
mr.
abe
fortas
that
is
equal
protection.
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
your
honor,
i
reached
the
result
--
mr.
abe
fortas
--
through
the
due
process
clause
standing
alone
and
i
can
--
and
i
also
get
comfort
from
the
equal
protection
clause.
but
i
believe
the
equal
protection
clause
reaches
only
a
phase
of
this
problem,
and
the
due
process
clause
reaches
it
in
its
entirety
and
is
self-sufficient.
mr.
abe
fortas
there
are
--
some
of
the
states,
mr.
justice
clark,
require
misdemeanors
and
whether
any
of
those
states
make
a
distinction
between
misdemeanors
and
types
of
traffic
cases,
i
don't
know.
mr.
abe
fortas
numeric
--
well,
let's
see.
it
doesn't
split
quite
that
way,
because
there
are
about
20
states,
at
least
20
states,
in
which
the
language
used
seems
to
indicate
in
varying
degrees
the
inclusion
of
misdemeanors.
and
there
--
we're
talking
about
37
states
in
all
where
this
rule
has
been
established
in
a
statutory
or
constitutional
form.
but
mr.
justice
clark,
doing
--
getting
this
thing
fined
down
with
respect
to
the
individual
states
is
a
very
difficult
job
of
research.
professor
kamisar
probably
has
done
the
best
job
that's
been
done
to
date
in
his
two
articles,
one
in
chicago
and
one
that
i
don't
believe
we
cite,
that
is
in
the
forthcoming
michigan
law
review.
he
sent
us
a
copy
of
the
galley
proof.
but
it's
very
difficult
to
know
precisely
what
the
situation
is
in
each
state.
mr.
abe
fortas
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
abe
fortas
no
sir,
i
certainly
do
not
lay
it
aside,
and
you'll
see
in
our
brief
that
we
argue
it
not,
mr.
justice
black,
in
terms
of
the
argument
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
incorporates
with
respect
to
the
states
the
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights.
mr.
abe
fortas
we
don't
--
mr.
abe
fortas
sir?
mr.
abe
fortas
fourteenth
amendment?
mr.
justice
black,
i
like
that
argument
that
you
have
so
eloquently
made
time
and
time
again.
i
can't
make
it
to
this
court
as
an
advocate
because
this
court's
turned
it
down
so
many
times.
i
hope
and
pray
that
you
will
never
cease
contending
for
it.
mr.
abe
fortas
sir?
mr.
abe
fortas
in
a
number
of
particulars.
and
this
is
--
mr.
abe
fortas
and
this
is
a
particular,
and
frankly,
i
think
there
are
alternative
forms
of
language
that
the
court
can
use
and
i'm
in
favor
of
the
court's
using
the
broadest
possible
--
mr.
abe
fortas
you
seem
to
know
me
well,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
abe
fortas
thank
you.
mr.
abe
fortas
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
abe
fortas
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
basic
proposition
that
i
believe
the
court
has
before
it
is
a
problem
of
constitutional
statesmanship,
perhaps,
that
this
court
has
recently
traversed
in
mapp
against
ohio.
mapp
against
ohio,
in
my
opinion,
presented
a
more
difficult
situation,
not
an
easier
situation.
i
believe
to
paraphrase
mr.
justice
clark's
notable
opinion
in
mapp
against
ohio,
that
time
has
set
its
face
against
betts
v.
brady.
i
believe,
again
to
quote
mr.
justice
clark
in
mapp
against
ohio,
and
i
quote,
“further
delay
in
reaching
the
present
result
could
have
no
effect
other
than
to
compound
the
difficulties
in
the
future.”
i
believe
that
that
is
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
the
situation
on
the
practical
side
of
this
case.
on
the
side
of
principle,
i
respectfully
submit
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
and
my
understanding
that
there
can
be
no
two
ways
about
it,
that
there
can
be
no
choice
here,
that
there
is
no
room
for
doubt,
that
the
rule
is
the
rule
that
was
so
eloquently
stated
and
perhaps
i'll
be
forgiven
if
i
say
never
better
stated
than
it
was
by
mr.
justice
sutherland
in
powell
against
alabama,
in
that
eloquent
opinion,
an
opinion
which
has
since
been
applied
only
to
capital
cases
and,
in
my
opinion,
wrongly
confined
to
capital
cases.
as
to
the
capital/noncapital
distinction,
i
think
that
this
court
itself
has
demonstrated
that
that
distinction
is
untenable
as
a
constitutional
matter,
and
nowhere
has
that
been
better
stated
than
in
the
court
martial
cases
which
we
have
analyzed,
because
of
their
remarkable
pertinence
here,
in
appendix
c
to
our
brief.
and
i
would
like
to
say,
to
quote
again
from
mr.
justice
clark's
dissenting
opinion
in
the
first
case
--
in
the
second
court
martial
case
he
wrote
the
opinion
of
the
court
--
in
the
first
court
martial
case
mr.
justice
clark
said,
for
the
dissenters,
for
himself
and
mr.
justice
burton,
that
the
dissenting
justices
could
“find
no
distinction
in
the
constitution
between
capital
and
other
cases.”
and
that,
of
course,
i
believe
has
always
been
the
case
here.
i
think
that
betts
against
brady
was
wrong
when
decided.
i
think
time
has
illuminated
that
fact.
but
i
think
that
perhaps
time
has
also
done
a
service,
because
time
has
prepared
the
way
so
that
the
rule,
the
correct
rule,
the
civilized
rule,
the
rule
of
american
constitutionalism,
the
rule
of
due
process,
may
now
be
stated
by
this
court
with
minimum
irritation
and
disruption
in
the
states.
mr.
abe
fortas
that
would
be
very
difficult.
i
don't
read
mr.
justice
roberts'
opinion
without
a
bias
of
my
own,
mr.
justice
harlan.
i
don't
believe
--
i
--
there's
one
significant
neglect
that
i
find
in
that
opinion
and
that
is
that
in
reciting
the
history
of
the
english
common
law,
i
find
an
important
omission,
which
is
the
omission
of
the
very
strong
current
that
ran
against
the
english
rule
allowing
counsel
only
in
misdemeanor
cases.
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
very
shortly
a
passage
that
i
found
--
i'm
sure
a
lot
of
other
people
have
found
it,
too
--
in
blackstone,
in
which
blackstone
points
out,
is
extremely
critical
of
the
english
restriction
on
counsel,
and
points
out
that
so
onerous
and
so
irritating
was
the
restriction
on
the
right
of
counsel
that
the
english
judges
developed
a
practice
of
permitting
counsel
to
stand
at
the
side
of
the
accused
and
tell
the
accused
what
to
say.
and
it
is
that
omission
that
i
find
in
mr.
justice
roberts'
opinion.
but
we
make
no
case
here
on
the
basis
of
the
conventions
of
the
historical
type
of
constitutional
interpretation.
i
don't
say
that
the
historical
technique
of
constitutional
interpretation
will
reach
my
result,
but
that
is
only
one
--
mr.
abe
fortas
well,
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
i
think
that
--
mr.
abe
fortas
i
would
have
to
say,
your
honor
that
i
believe
that
betts
against
brady
is
wrongly
decided.
we
lawyers
always
like
to
avoid
that.
i
would
say
second
that
there
are
some
intervening
facts
that
we
point
out
--
i
have
taken
too
much
of
your
time.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
there
are
some
figures
with
respect
to
florida
practice
in
a
study
made
by
the
american
bar
foundation
of
october
1962
that
came
to
me
after
our
brief
was
written,
and
they
may
be
of
some
possible
interest
to
the
court
and
i
should
like
permission
to
file
a
copy,
furnishing
a
copy
to
other
counsel,
of
course.
mr.
abe
fortas
and
i
thank
you.
