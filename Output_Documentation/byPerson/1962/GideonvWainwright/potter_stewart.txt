justice
potter
stewart
mr.
fortas,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
some
point
--
the
question
whether
or
not
its
--
we
have
before
us
the
trial
transcript.
but
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference,
does
it,
because
these
were
the
allegations
of
his
habeas
corpus
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
application
in
the
state
of
florida.
they
don't
--
there's
no
variance
between
them
and
this
copy.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
we
have
the
same
case
here,
whether
the
transcript
is
before
us
or
not,
don't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
how
long
has
it
been
since
we've
failed
to
find
special
circumstances?
i
think
i'm
right
in
saying
that
in
the
four
and
a
half
terms
i've
been
here,
we've
always
found
special
circumstances
in
any
case.
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
those
michigan
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
very
important
but
i
think
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
right
in
--
--
the
comment
i
made.
justice
potter
stewart
from
my
recollection.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
colorado
wasn't
completely
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
so
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
colorado
on
both
lists
and
that's
the
reason
i
wondered
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
colorado
is
one
of
the
22
here.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
just
looked
at
the
appendix
to
the
dissenting
opinion
in
betts
against
brady
indicated
that
some
35
states
required
the
appointment
of
counsel
at
that
time.
and
i
wondered
if
there
had
been
so
little
development
since.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
don't
--
don't
tarry
now.
you
can
--
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
that
very
word
has
many
different
meanings
in
the
different
states
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
trouble
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
verbalizing
any
test.
arraignment
in
some
states
has
--
is
quite
a
different
process
from
what
it
is
in
other
states.
justice
potter
stewart
does
that
word
have
a
common
meaning
in
all
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
50
states?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
the
traffic
violation?
a
person
who
can
afford
a
lawyer
is
entitled,
as
far
as
i
know
in
every
state,
to
hire
a
lawyer
for
traffic
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
most
of
them
don't.
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
--
in
telling
us
your
thoughts
as
to
the
scope
of
this
right,
are
you
--
just
as
a
matter
of
technique,
are
you
relying
now
on
equal
protection,
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
arguing
equal
protection
rather
than
the
due
process
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
either
one?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
talking
about
the
due
process
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
demilier?
or
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
the
assumption
behind
the
distance
of
the
legal
profession?
florida
wouldn't
let
gideon
represent
anybody
else
on
trial
in
that
state.
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
distinction
in
the
words
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
itself
either
between
a
capital
offense
or
a
penitentiary
offense
or
an
offense
that
leads
to
a
fine
of
a
dollar;
because
it
says
life,
liberty
or
property,
doesn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
state
have
a
right
of
appeal
in
a
criminal
case
in
your
state?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would,
as
a
practical
matter,
answer
mr.
justice
goldberg's
question.
i
suppose
the
state
could
never
appeal
the
--
if
the
judge
intervened
to
the
extent
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
he
acted
as
defense
counsel.
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
the
state
would
have
no
appeal
from
such?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
trouble
is
there
and
you
have
two
things
conflicting.
i
suppose
a
man
has
a
constitutional
right
or
a
right
as
a
free
individual
human
being
to
insist
on
an
unfair
trial,
doesn't
he?
and
to
insist
on
waiving
his
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
suppose
i
am
right
in
my
assumption
that
i
made
earlier
that
florida
wouldn't
permit
gideon
or
any
other
layman
to
defend
anyone
else
in
the
state
on
trial,
would
it?
justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
gideon
maybe
get
in
trouble
for
practicing
law
without
a
license?
justice
potter
stewart
except
--
as
i've
understood
it,
you
said
that
in
your
four
most
populous
counties,
as
a
matter
of
practice,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
criminal
defendants
are
provided
with
counsel.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
know
offhand
how
much
of
the
population
of
florida
is
in
those
four
counties?
half
of
it?
justice
potter
stewart
presumably,
if
the
percentage
of
crime
was
pretty
well
scattered
out
representatively
throughout
the
state,
then
half
of
the
convictions
would
have
come
from
those
four
counties.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
--
going
back
just
a
minute,
i
didn't
understand
the
argument
to
have
been
made
that
a
state
was
under
the
obligation
to
appoint
a
lawyer
for
an
indigent
who
in
turn
was
under
an
obligation
to
enter
a
not
guilty
plea.
often
in
the
case
of
a
nonindigent,
the
best
advice
that
a
lawyer
can
give
to
a
client
is
to
plead
guilty.
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
that
would
follow
from
--
that
was
argued
here.
but
i
didn't
understand
the
further
argument
to
be
made
that
it
was
state-appointed
counsel's
duty
to
enter
a
not
guilty
plea
in
every
case.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
that's
--
i
don't
know
what
that
proves.
maybe
some
of
them
would
have
been,
many
of
them
would
have
been
guilty
pleas
if
counsel
had
been
appointed
and
if
competent
counsel
had
been
there
advising
the
defendant,
but
maybe
some
of
them
would
not
have
been.
justice
potter
stewart
and
a
guilty
plea
--
you're
not
arguing
that
a
guilty
plea
is
itself
a
waiver
of
counsel?
justice
potter
stewart
well
don't
you
--
can't
you
conceive
of
the
possibility
that
many
of
these
pleas
of
guilty
are
entered
by
people
who,
if
advised
by
counsel,
would
have
pleaded
not
guilty
and
might
well
have
been
acquitted?
justice
potter
stewart
do
any
of
your
counties,
as
a
matter
of
practice
or
custom,
do
the
trial
judges
appoint
lawyers?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
collateral
proceedings.
justice
potter
stewart
their
post-conviction
proceedings.
justice
potter
stewart
i
--
in
that
connection,
north
carolina,
which
is
one
of
the
five
states,
as
i
understand,
that,
like
alabama
and
florida,
make
no
provision
for
trial
counsel,
does,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law,
require
that
an
indigent
bringing
post-conviction
proceedings
must
be
assigned
counsel.
that's
in
hudson
against
north
carolina
that
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
custom
or
practice.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
occasionally
done,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
we
can
assume,
and
i
do
assume,
all
that,
i'm
right
along
with
you,
but
the
judge's
job
is
to
be
a
judge,
not
to
be
a
defense
counsel.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
would
not
be
the
kind
of
men
that
you're
describing
if
they,
instead
of
acting
as
a
judge,
acted
as
one
of
the
litigants,
counsel
for
one
of
the
litigants.
justice
potter
stewart
in
all
honesty,
isn't
that
a
matter
of
just
good
trial
strategy
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
from
the
prosecutor's
point
of
view?
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
a
matter
of
trial
strategy,
it's
a
weapon
that
might
well
backfire
if
the
jury
saw
that
the
defendant
was
just
there
helpless
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
--
as
a
matter
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
logic,
also,
i
don't
see
quite
where
this
argument
leads
you,
because
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
deprivation
of
counsel
to
a
criminal
defendant
impairs
and
impedes
the
adversary
system
of
justice
because
it
makes
it
necessary
for
you
not
to
try
your
case
to
the
utmost.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
that
you
could
argue
that
it
would
require
the
state
to
appoint
counsel
where
all
that
was
wanted
was
the
advice
of
a
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
trying
to
do.
