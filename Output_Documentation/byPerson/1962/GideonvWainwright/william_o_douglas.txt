justice
william
o.

well,
this
federalism
that
justice
harlan
mentions
is
implicit,
as
i
gather
in
all
that
we
have
written,
i
believe
i
have
read
all
of
them,
written
some
of
them.
i
don't
know
if
anyone
has
--
any
member
of
this
court
has
come
out
and
said
in
so
many
terms
it's
the
constitutional
right
of
the
state
to
provide
a
system
whereby
people
get
unfair
trial.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
that's
what
we
were
talking
about,
isn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
mean,
if
a
person
can't
have
a
fair
trial
without
a
lawyer
and
this
is
the
problem
of
federalism,
you
come
down
to
whether
--
how
a
state
has
a
constitutional
right
to
provide
a
system
that
perpetuates
unfair
trials.
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
remember
general
whether
they
were
following
our
decision
in
griffin
versus
illinois
requiring
the
indigent
state
to
furnish
the
indigent
transcripts
on
appeal
whether
there
was
a
general
release
of
prisoners
all
around
the
country
or
in
illinois?
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
hear
that
argument
made
many
times
in
various
situations
and
there
may
be
something
to
it
at
times,
but
i
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i've
never
heard
of
anybody
actually
being
set
free
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
this
country.
have
you?
justice
william
o.
douglas
may
i
ask
a
question
in
that
direction?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
notice
that
the
brief
filed
by
the
state
of
oregon,
an
amicus
brief,
suggests
and
indicates
that
it
would
be
less
bothersome,
less
burdensome
to
the
state
of
oregon
to
see
that
defendants
get
counsel
at
the
trial
rather
than
to
follow
up
and
process
all
of
these
habeas
corpus
cases
that
follow
in
the
wake
of
the
thousands
of
cases
where
no
lawyer
is
allowed
to
represent
them.
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
true
in
your
experience?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
have
any
information
as
to
the
number
of
lawyers
that
the
state
of
florida
has
that
are
engaged
in
processing
habeas
corpus
proceedings
for
the
state,
either
at
the
state
level
or
the
federal
level?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
lawyers
for
the
state.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
there's
nothing
in
the
sixth
amendment
that
talks
about
driver's
license,
or
is
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
maybe
we
should
have
some
new
constitutional
limits.
maybe
if
these
laymen
are
so
good
at
defending
themselves,
as
you
say,
maybe
we
should
get
the
sixth
amendment
repealed.
