mr.
george
d.
mentz
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
company
with
florida,
alabama
and
north
carolina
are
of
the
opinion
that
betts
versus
brady
should
not
be
overruled.
regrettably,
my
presentation
will
in
many
areas
duplicate
that
of
mr.
jacob,
but
fortunately,
i'll
be
brief.
we
contend
that
the
sixth
amendment
providing
for
representation
by
counsel
in
criminal
prosecutions
operates
only
on
the
federal
government
that
state
appointment
of
counsel,
in
and
of
itself,
is
not
an
essential
to
a
fair
trial
that
an
asserted
denial
of
due
process
should
be
tested
by
an
appraisal
of
the
totality
of
facts
in
a
given
case
and
that
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause
does
not
make
the
sixth
amendment
applicable
to
the
states.
now,
i
candidly
admit
that
along
with
other
forms
of
public
assistance
for
indigent
persons,
it
would
be
desirable
for
the
states
to
furnish
counsel
in
all
criminal
prosecutions,
but
we
contend
that
there
is
no
need
for
appointment
of
counsel
in
every
state
prosecution
and
that
each
individual
state
should
have
the
privilege
of
exercising
its
constitutional
right
under
the
tenth
amendment
of
determining
when
appointment
is
necessary.
we
say
that
it's
a
sound
rule
that
an
asserted
denial
of
due
process
is
to
be
tested
by
an
appraisal
of
the
totality
of
the
facts
in
a
given
case
and
that
a
constitutional
violation
occurs
only
where
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel
constitutes
a
denial
of
fundamental
fairness
which
is
shocking
to
the
universal
sense
of
justice.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
asserted
that
from
75%
to
90%
of
all
state
cases
are
decided
on
pleas
of
guilty.
in
accepting
as
valid
those
statistics,
we
say
that
it
is
unrealistic
to
assume
that
anything
more
than
a
very
few
of
those
pleas
result
from
the
accused
ignorance
or
fear
or
from
any
improper
influence
by
state
authorities.
practically,
everyone
who
pleads
guilty
to
a
criminal
charge
does
so
because
he
knows
that
the
prosecuting
authorities
can
prove
his
guilt
and
because
he
hopes
to
obtain
leniency
by
dispensing
with
an
unnecessary
trial.
and
we
say
that
a
state
should
not
be
burdened
with
the
expense
of
appointing
an
attorney
who
in
good
conscience
could
recommend
only
to
his
client
that
he
enter
a
plea
of
guilty.
now,
as
critics
complain
that
in
the
20
years
following
betts
versus
brady,
this
court
has
been
compelled
to
reverse
more
and
more
state
cases,
indicating
a
necessity
for
overruling
betts
versus
brady.
we
don't
deny
that
this
court
has
observed
some
cases
which
have
shocked
its
sense
of
justice.
the
state
judges
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
well,
as
i
understood
the
arguments
advanced
here
today,
they
said
that
the
necessity
for
counsel
existed
almost
from
the
time
of
arrest.
and
if
that
is
true,
then
wouldn't
counsel
have
to
be
appointed
in
time
for
him
to
make
his
plea?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no,
sir.
not
in
every
case,
but
i
mean
i'm
just
saying
that
the
great
majority
of
state
cases
are
disposed
of
on
guilty
pleas.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
quite
possible,
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no,
sir;
no,
sir.
i'm
just
saying
that
it
--
well,
i
say
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
so
many
cases
are
disposed
of
by
guilty
pleas
that
no
great
advantage
would
occur
to
the
indigent
accused
if
counsel
were
appointed.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
yes,
sir.
i
admit
that
certain
cases
might
turn
that
way
but
on
the
other
hand,
my
main
contention
is
that
by
and
large
most
of
them
would
not.
of
course,
that's
in
the
realm
of
speculation.
i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
don't
doubt
it,
sir.
as
i
was
saying,
critics
complain
that
this
court
has
found
it
necessary
to
reverse
more
and
more
state
convictions,
indicating
a
necessity
for
overruling
betts
versus
brady,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
here
the
emphasis
is
placed
on
those
cases
which
this
court
in
its
opinion
has
seen
fit
to
reverse
and
has
ignored
the
thousands
of
state
prosecutions
which
are
conducted
absent
with
the
aid
of
defense
counsel
which
present
no
cause
for
complaint.
true,
it's
said
that
all
indigents
can't
bring
their
cases
to
this
court,
but
to
me
that
is
not
a
realistic
criticism
because
of
the
ease
of
which
indigents
can
proceed
as
paupers
in
the
federal
courts,
all
of
the
federal
courts,
including
this
one.
our
office
is
flooded
with
coram
nobis
and
habeas
corpus
petitions,
and
i'm
sure
that
this
court
gets
its
fair
share
of
them.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
don't
know.
i
can
only
say
this,
that
it
is
my
firm
conviction
that
there
is
a
growing
awareness
among
the
judges,
our
trial
judges,
of
the
necessity
or
desirability
of
appointing
counsel,
and
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
sir.
it
is
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir,
it
is.
but
i
don't
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
couldn't
--
i
don't
have
that
prophetic
endowment.
i
just
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
don't
know
of
any
in
the
trial
stage.
i
do
know
this
that
in
montgomery,
we
run
into
all
of
these
prisoners,
state
prisoners
who
are
filing
habeas
corpus
petitions
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
--
and
it's
not
uncommon
there
for
the
circuit
judge
to
appoint
attorneys
for
the
prisoners
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
to
help
them
in
their
post-conviction
proceedings.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
this
practice
that
i
speak
of
in
alabama
is
not
by
statute,
it's
just
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
it's
just
out
of
the
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
sir.
it's
just
a
gratuitous
act
on
the
part
of
the
judge,
and
that
is
one
of
the
arguments
which
we
contend
obviate
or
negates
the
contention
that
you've
got
to
have
counsel
to
get
a
fair
trial.
in
other
words,
i
think
our
judges
as
a
whole
are
men
of
very
high
caliber.
i
think
that
they
are
intellectually
and
morally
capable
of
fulfilling
the
duties
of
their
office,
and
i
think
they
sincerely
try
to
prevent
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
that
is
true,
sir,
and
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
but
i
think,
and
i
have
seen
it
happen,
i
have
seen
trial
judges
wear
two
hats
without
any
great
degree
of
incompatibility
to
this
extent,
that
they
--
i've
seen
them
strike
juries
for
an
indigent
defendant
who
had
no
counsel,
and
they
usually
come
up
with
pretty
good
defense
juries.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir,
i
do.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
i
don't
--
they
don't
go
to
that
extent
of
making
a
plea
to
the
jury.
but
i
have
seen
them
do
this,
that
when
they
would
charge
the
jury
as
to
the
law
of
the
case
that
they
would
point
out
what
the
defendant's
theory
of
defense
was
and
what
evidence
he
had
educed
in
support
of
it.
no,
i've
never
seen
them
actually
espouse
the
defendant's
cause.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir,
he
is
not
supposed
to.
another
thing
that
we
think
militates
against
the
argument
that
a
layman
can't
get
a
fair
trial
without
aid
of
counsel
lies
in
the
fact
that
your
defense
attorneys
--
or
rather,
your
prosecuting
attorneys
are
much
more
lenient
insofar
as
not
interposing
objections
to
the
introduction
of
evidence.
the
--
or
during
the
cross-examination,
the
examination
or
cross-examination
of
witnesses.
and
even
if
the
accused
himself
presents
an
argument
to
the
jury,
the
solicitor
invariably
will
refrain
from
doing
it.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes
sir,
it
is.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
it
is
but
nevertheless,
as
you
know,
the
closing
argument
to
a
jury
is
one
of
the
most
critical
stages
of
a
trial,
and
by
refraining
from
giving
that
argument
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
deprived
of
a
very
potent
weapon.
and
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
that's
it.
i
mean,
i
freely
admit
that
the
solicitor
does
it
because
he
knows
that
he'd
be
put
at
a
disadvantage
by
not
doing
it.
in
other
words,
he
recognizes
the
fact
that
a
man
appearing
unaided
is
in
the
role
of
an
underdog
and
he
just
engenders
the,
our
almost
universal
sense
of
sympathy
for
the
underdog.
now
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
no
sir,
i
don't
--
i
wouldn't
mean
to
go
that
far.
i
don't
think
the
man
falls
back
all
the
way.
but
i
mean
there
are
certain
areas
in
which
he
gives,
that
--
which
he
wouldn't
do
if
there
was
an
adversary
counsel
representing
the
defendant.
i've
talked
--
at
the
last
meeting
of
the
bar
association,
when
i
talked
to
a
group
of
the
state
solicitors
and
they
were
of
the
widespread
agreement
that
an
indigent
appearing
without
aid
of
counsel
really
stood
a
better
chance
of
getting
a
lighter
sentence
or
even
an
outright
acquittal
than
one
who
does
have
an
attorney.
and
i
think
one
reason
for
that
is
this
that
the
prosecuting
attorney
feels
free
to
pull
out
all
the
stops
if
he's
got
an
opponent
and
the
average
opponent,
at
least
in
alabama,
the
average
lawyer
there
is
just
not
sufficiently
versed
in
criminal
practice
to
cope
with
most
of
your
career
prosecutors.
i
just
mention
these
things
to
demonstrate
that
generally
speaking,
indigents
charged
with
crime
are
not
as
unfortunately
situated
as
the
critics
of
betts
versus
brady
would
have
us
believe.
another
thing,
i
think
that
since
betts
versus
brady
there's
been
a
progression
in
the
education
of
most
groups
and
i
believe
that
if
the
average
man
who
has
got
a
real
valid
defense
is
sufficiently
articulate
enough
to
get
it
across
to
the
jury
--
he
may
not
do
it
in
the
nice
legal
niceties,
but
he
gets
the
story
across.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
not
completely;
no,
sir.
of
course,
now,
critics
of
betts
have
said
that
defendants
prosecuted
of
crimes
are
entitled
to
counsel
whether
it's
life,
liberty
or
their
property.
and
this,
of
course,
raises
the
problem
of
whether
the
protection
of
counsel
should
be
limited
to
felonies
or
to
misdemeanors
or
to
whatever
terms
we're
going
to
use
these
different
offenses.
because
certainly
an
illegal
sentence
of,
i
think,
30
days
is
just
as
much
a
violation
of
due
process
as
one
for
life.
another
thing
is
why
should
we
limit
it
to
criminal
prosecutions?
the
due
process
clause
protects
property,
so
it
seems
just
as
logical
that
if
you
say
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
appointment
of
counsel
in
criminal
cases,
it
also
requires
appointment
of
counsel
in
civil
cases
where
property
is
involved.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
sir.
that
would
certainly
be
a
logical
extension
of
it.
of
course,
you
might
say
that
this
is
carrying
it
to
the
absurd
degree
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
--
but
certainly
logic
would
carry
you
that
far.
and
it's
been
mentioned
about
the
police
courts
now
in
alabama,
i
know
we
have
people
who
get
a
certain
number
of
traffic
violations
or
certain
type
of
traffic
violations
have
their
driver's
license
taken
away
from
them.
well,
that's
a
very
--
if
a
man's
a
salesman,
loss
of
his
driving
license
is
a
very
vital
thing
to
him,
and
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
no
sir,
but
it
--
as
i
say,
the
fourteenth
amendment
protects
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
these
lay
defendants
are
all
that
good,
but
i
say
that
they're
not
as
helpless
as
some
people
seem
to
think
they
are.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
as
some
appellate
judges,
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i
didn't
understand
you,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
it
will
put
us
all
out
of
business,
now,
if
they
do
that.
i
agree
with
mr.
jacob
completely
now
when
he
says
that
powell,
although
powell
is
often
cited
for
the
proposition
that
as
a
mandatory
rule
that
counsel
be
appointed
in
all
capital
cases,
i
don't
find
that
in
powell.
i
think
that
powell
holds
that
under
the
facts
of
that
case
there
were
special
circumstances
which
required
that
counsel
be
appointed
in
order
to
meet
the
requirements
of
due
process.
and
as
for
hamilton
versus
alabama,
now
i'm
not
sure
certainly
the
decision
in
hamilton
does
not
expressly
say
that
it's
decided
on
due
process
grounds,
and
i'm
of
the
opinion
that
that
case
doesn't
lay
down
any
broad
principle
of
law
that's
applicable
to
all
states,
but
that
it's
applicable
only
in
alabama,
because
of
the
special
circumstances
attendant
at
the
time
of
arraignment
there.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i'd
rather
see
each
case
--
mr.
george
d.
mentz
i'd
rather
see
each
case
decided
individually.
mr.
george
d.
mentz
well,
we
--
hope
(voice
overlap)
mr.
george
d.
mentz
sir?
mr.
george
d.
mentz
yes,
sir.
well,
as
i
say,
we
--
it's
the
old
situation
we
hope
the
framers
would
tell,
i
guess.
we
hope
to
win
one.
and
again,
repeating
what
mr.
jacob
said,
i'd
like
to
say
that
as
a
practical
matter
i
think
that
a
great
many
states
will
have
difficulties
in
finding
enough
qualified
lawyers
who
are
versed
in
criminal
practice
to
appoint
and
certainly
they
are
going
to,
in
alabama,
at
least,
we're
going
to
have
financial
difficulties
in
paying
them.
and
as
i
have
said
before,
i
don't
think
that
the
popular
plea
now
is
not
that
i
was
denied
counsel,
it's
that
i
was
denied
effective
counsel.
and
that
is
going
to
be
--
they'll
just
switch
from
one
horse
to
the
other
in
their
efforts
to
attack
the
state
judgments.
thank
you.
