mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
amici
urge
the
court
to
reconsider
betts
against
brady
and
overrule
it.
we
have
carefully
examined
the
federal
question
and
we
do
think
that
is
the
heart
of
the
problem.
but
in
the
examination
of
that
question,
we
think
you
have
to
start
back
to
the
fourth
--
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
question
of
due
process
and
equal
protection.
and
we
think
that
the
error
in
betts
against
brady
is
the
basic
assumption
that
you
can
have
a
fair
trial
in
the
ordinary
circumstances
where
you
do
not
have
special
circumstances
without
a
lawyer.
there
is
where
we
think
the
error
in
betts
against
brady
is,
and
that's
where
it
needs
to
be
corrected.
now,
it's
our
position
that
the
judges
of
this
country,
including
this
court
and
all
the
other
judges,
have
a
special
responsibility
concerning
this
problem.
and
right
along
with
that
is
the
responsibility
of
lawyers,
because
the
layman
doesn't
know
this
problem
like
we
do.
this
is
the
judges'
and
the
lawyers'
problem.
we
deal
with
these
intricate
questions.
we're
here
before
this
bench
from
time
to
time
with
them.
all
that
was
involved,
for
instance,
in
mapp
against
ohio,
the
coerced
confession,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
has
been
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
a
grand
jury
or
petit
jury,
the
right
to
cross-examination.
and
then
betts
against
brady
assumes
that
the
layman
knows
enough
to
present
those
arguments
on
his
own
behalf.
now,
in
most
cases,
we
should
be
the
ones,
we
of
the
bar
at
least,
and
i
think
the
courts
know
it
just
as
well
as
we
do
because
they
observe
it
day
by
day.
it
just
isn't
true
that
the
layman
knows
those
rules
of
law,
and
if
he
does
happen
to
hear
about
them,
he
doesn't
know
how
to
express
them
and
represent
himself.
well,
that's
what's
wrong
with
betts
against
brady
and
it
is
time,
long
passed,
that
our
profession
should
stand
up
and
say,
we
know
because
of
our
day
by
day
experience
that
the
ordinary
layman
can't
get
a
fair
trial,
either
in
the
federal
courts
where
it's
corrected
or
in
thestate
courts
of
this
country
where
he
represents
himself.
just
imagine
all
of
the
rules
that
the
lawyer
has
to
deal
with
to
represent
a
client
properly,
from
the
moment
he
was
first
consulted,
in
the
ordinary
criminal
case,
and
then
imagine
the
layman
trying
to
follow
that
track,
find
the
cases,
find
the
distinctions
between
one
case
and
another,
and
applying
them.
now,
it
would
be
bad
enough
for
us
of
the
profession
to
say
that
you
could
have
a
fair
trial
under
those
circumstances,
knowing
what
we
do
with
regard
to
the
ordinary
layman
without
counsel,
but
we
also
know
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
case,
whether
it's
the
government
of
the
united
states,
which
you
are
particularly
familiar
with
and
i
am,
who
has
skilled
counsel
that
tried
hundreds
of
cases,
or
whether
it's
a
state
prosecutor
with
his
vast
experience.
it
is
enough
of
a
fiction
to
be
able
to
claim
that
the
ordinary
lawyer,
with
the
greatest
diligence
and
skill,
is
able
to
present
fairly
a
case
on
behalf
of
a
defendant
against
this
skilled
prosecutor
that's
had
hundreds
of
cases
behind
him
and
understands
the
reaction
of
the
court,
in
addition
to
knowing
right
off
every
case
that
could
have
a
bearing
upon
the
question.
but
when
you
take
the
poor
layman
and
put
him
against
those
odds,
there
isn't
the
remotest
possibility
that
you
can
get
a
fair
trial
except
by
pure
accident.
now,
how
does
it
affect
the
federal
situation?
in
the
first
place,
if
you
assume
that
you
can't
have
a
fair
trial
in
the
ordinary
case,
then
i
contend
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
permit
the
states
to
have
unfair
trials.
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
question
about
that
with
this
court,
any
member
of
this
court.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
there
is
no
question
but
what
they
are
--
and
you've
said
it
time
after
time,
it
cannot
set
up
a
system
which
provides
under
that
system
for
unfair
trials.
now,
special
circumstance
has
many
problems
that
are
damaging
to
the
federal
system
beyond
that.
this
court
has
struggled
with
them.
it
is
tried
in
good
faith
to
apply
special
circumstance.
and
out
of
the
last
nine
cases
where
the
state
courts
couldn't
find,
since
1942,
special
circumstances,
this
court
has
found
it
six
times.
now,
that
doesn't
help
federal-state
relations.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
quicksall
is
one
that
i
recall
particularly,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
demilier
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
there
are
two
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
there
are
two
pennsylvania
cases
and
a
michigan
case
as
i
recall.
one
is
pennsylvania
case
found
special
circumstances
and
the
other
one
didn't.
and
we
have
great
difficulty
in
trying
to
analyze
them
to
justify
the
one
that
didn't.
but
the
court
found
it.
and
in
the
burke
case,
if
you
will
recall,
the
court
of
appeals
of
pennsylvania
said
that
it
shouldn't
have
to
guess
about
these
matters.
it
just
couldn't
figure
out
from
the
supreme
court
decisions,
when
one
went
one
way
and
one
went
the
other,
where
the
special
circumstances
law
did
lie.
and
it
is
a
very
difficult
situation.
of
course,
as
you
look
at
toward
later
years,
the
court
has
quite
generally
found
special
circumstances.
but
every
time
that
that
is
done,
the
states
have
presented
it,
oftentimes
because
it
was
done
not
merely
by
this
court,
but
often
by
a
federal
trial
court,
united
states
district
court,
which
they
felt
was
overruling
their
highest
appellate
court.
and
all
of
that
is
involved
in
this
attack
upon
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
that
has
been
made
from
time
to
time,
and
the
effort
before
the
congress
to
try
to
limit
it.
it's
been
an
abrasive
effect
and
it
hasn't
been
fair
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes.
they
have
presented
the
--
not
only
the
procedure,
but
also
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
determine
when
special
circumstances
did
lie
under
this
rule.
now
it
also,
as
we
show
in
our
brief,
out
of
139
cases,
the
state
courts
have
only
been
able
to
find
11
in
which
they
could
find
any
special
circumstances
of
any
kind.
and
it
is
curious
that
when
there's
as
many
as
have
been
found
by
this
court
where
there
were
special
circumstances
out
of
those
that
came
before
it
since
1942,
that
only
in
11
out
of
139
the
state
courts
could
find
special
circumstances.
now,
that
in
itself
does
not
help
the
situation.
but
beyond
that,
when
you
consider
the
procedure
and
the
fact
that
only
certain
cases
come
before
this
court,
only
certain
cases
can
possibly
get
here
regarding
special
circumstances,
and
by
the
very
nature
of
things,
even
though
there
might
have
been
many
of
those
cases
which
we
didn't
have
time
to
analyze
in
detail,
of
the
139
where
there
were
special
circumstances
that
would
have
satisfied
this
court,
they
did
not
get
here.
now,
in
order
to
get
here,
as
your
honors
well
know,
there
has
to
be
an
exhaustion
of
state
remedies,
and
then
if
it
comes
here
on
an
appeal
or
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
different
than
if
it
comes
here
collaterally
and
the
attack
is
made
collaterally.
but
on
the
percentages,
this
rule
is
very
damaging
to
the
individual
as
well
as
the
whole
system.
this
history
shows
how
bad
the
effect
is.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
don't
think
it's
so
obvious
in
the
earlier
part
of
our
history
as
it
is
later.
i
think
that
our
country
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
its
1942.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
our
country
has
developed
since
then.
i
think
the
mere
fact
that
we
have
some
43
states
now
--
45
states,
in
fact
--
who
have
come
to
the
place
where
they
have
recognized
that
either
by
the
constitution,
statute
or
court
rule,
or
by
practice,
there
should
be
such
a
provision,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
country
has
developed
to
the
extent
that
it
recognizes
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
the
difficulty
i
have
with
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
mr.
justice
harlan,
and
i
think
it's
to
their
credit
that
they
have
come
so
far,
but
i
don't
think
this
court
has
to
wait
until
the
last
one
comes,
either
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
--
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
it's
inherent
in
my
argument
that
you
can't
--
if
you
cannot
have
a
fair
trial,
the
states
are
required
to
do
something
about
it.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
if
you
assume
that
you
can't
have
a
fair
trial
without
counsel
--
which
i
am
sure
every
lawyer
here
knows
as
the
ordinary
case.
now,
there
may
be
exceptions
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
as
a
generalization,
i
think
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
harlan,
i'm
trying
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
generalization
in
betts
against
brady
that
generally
you
can
have
a
fair
trial
without
counsel,
that's
what
betts
against
brady
says.
and
that
only
in
special
circumstances
do
you
have
an
unfair
trial
without
counsel.
i
say
the
rule
has
got
to
be
turned
around
according
to
the
facts,
that
generally,
you
can't
have
a
fair
trial
without
counsel
and
the
exception
is
the
case
that
you
and
i
know
about
where
some
skilled
layman
has
been
able
to
get
a
fair
trial
despite
not
having
counsel.
but
betts
against
brady
is
built
upon
the
premise
that
generally,
you
can
get
a
fair
trial
without
counsel.
and
that's
where
i
think
it's
unsound.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
that's
right.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
and
it's
rarely,
as
we
lawyers
all
know,
that
a
man
does
as
well,
because
we
have
a
saying,
as
you
all
know,
that
when
he
represents
himself
he
has
a
fool
for
counsel,
and
it's
often
true.
now,
there
are
exceptions,
but
i
don't
think
the
rule
is
sound
when
it's
based
upon
the
exception.
it
should
be
based
upon
the
general
rule
that
you
can't
have
a
fair
trial
without
counsel.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
in
my
own
experience,
the
things
that
i
am
thinking
of,
and
possibly
mr.
justice
harlan,
were
the
cases
where
a
man
had
no
real
defense
and
the
best
thing
for
him
to
do
was
to
go
down
there
and
sort
of
ask
for
the
mercy
of
the
court
and
pay
whatever
fine
he
had
and
get
out
of
it
the
best
he
could.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
oftentimes
not,
and
oftentimes
that's
part
of
the
problem,
too,
about
not
having
counsel
before
arraignment.
that
he
will
not
know
that
there
are
various
charges
against
him
that
he
might
plead
against
one
of
the
lesser
charges
rather
than
the
greater
charge
and
he
has
to
make
the
selection
on
his
own
without
even
knowing
what
the
sentences
could
be,
and
the
range,
and
oftentimes
winds
up
with
something
very
adverse
to
him.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
think
that
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
mr.
justice
clark,
i
think
that
was
a
peculiar
situation
in
regard
to
those
cases
and
that
a
skilled
counsel
might
advise
them
to
represent
themselves
and
throw
themselves
upon
the
mercy
of
the
court
and
the
jury
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
yes,
but
i
am
sure
that
there
are
many
cases
that
come
before
this
court
and
before
the
lower
federal
courts
and
state
courts
where
no
member
of
this
court
and
no
member
of
the
bar
that
are
here
would
want
to
advise
a
layman
to
go
out
and
see
what
happened
to
him
in
the
case
of
a
serious
charge
of
any
kind.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
contentions
by
the
respondent
in
regard
to
emptying
the
jails
that
i
would
like
to
deal
with
here.
on
page
55,
they
present
a
number
of
cases
in
which
they
show
the
large
number
of
persons
who
are
incarcerated
and
what
the
effect
would
be
of
this
rule.
in
the
first
place
it
is
the
position
of
the
amici
that
we
are
dealing
now
with
the
representation
in
criminal
cases
and
that
civil
cases
are
not
involved
and
there's
--
that
question
is
before
the
court.
secondly,
i
have
great
difficulty
trying
to
appraise
and
be
of
any
help
to
the
court
with
regard
to
the
various
cases
that
are
listed
on
page
55
because
they
are
grouped
in
such
a
way
that
there
are
pleas
of
guilty
with
no
counsel,
some
4,000
--
1,500
pleas
of
guilty
represented
by
counsel.
i
don't
know
how
those
cases
could
be,
could
come
before
the
court
again.
they've
had
their
chance
to
have
counsel
presumably
on
those
facts,
although
they're
very
sketchy.
and
the
477
pleas
of
not
guilty
and
were
not
represented
by
counsel.
if
they
were
represented
by
counsel
during
the
trial
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
didn't
know
of
any
and
it
hasn't
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
by
the
respondent
at
all,
and
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
they
always
have
a
right
to
retry,
and
of
course
i
recognize
that
there
may
be
difficulty
of
getting
the
evidence
at
a
late
date,
but
still
there
is
that
right
of
retrial
that
they
have.
and
if
they
haven't
had
a
fair
trial,
they
ought
to
have
one
fair
trial
in
regard
to
it.
now,
in
johnson
against
zerbst,
this
same
argument
was
made,
if
you
will
recall,
in
the
government's
brief,
and
attorney
general
homer
cummings
was
not
sympathetic
with
the
idea
of
not
having
counsel
because
of,
i'm
sure,
because
of
some
remarks
he
made
independently.
but
the
government
did
present
a
brief
in
which
it
was
trying
to
support
the
position
and
presented
all
they
could
on
behalf
of
not
having
counsel
in
federal
cases,
and
it
was
urged
that
it
would
empty
the
jails,
as
one
of
the
arguments.
and
the
court
treated
that
question.
it
wasn't
frightened
by
it
as
apparently
(inaudible)
by
the
government's
brief,
but
it
did
deal
with
it.
and
it
said
that
of
course
there
is
a
presumed
regularity
about
judgments
that
would
have
to
be
dealt
with,
but
it
proceeded
to
recognize
that
johnson
against
zerbst
could
be
applied
retrospective
regardless
of
that
in
terrorem
argument.
and
there
is
a
considerable
argument
here
about,
by
the
respondent,
about
the
application
of
mapp
against
ohio,
and
some
of
the
cases
as
explained
by
counsel,
i
don't
think
are
quite
completely
revealed
to
the
court.
now,
in
the
state
of
new
york,
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
mapp
against
ohio
would
be
applied
by
it
in
all
cases
where
the
court
had
not
disposed
of
an
appeal,
even
though
mapp
against
ohio
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
and
judge
foley,
in
the
united
states
district
court,
in
several
cases
dealt
with
that
problem
and
said
that
in
regard
to
federalism,
recognizing
the
problem,
that
the
states
should
be
given,
particularly
in
a
state
like
new
york
where
the
court
of
appeals
had
been
advanced
in
consideration
of
such
matters,
to
examine
the
problem
in
the
first
instance.
but
he
didn't
in
any
way
say
that
mapp
against
ohio
would
not
be
applied
if
the
state
courts
did
not
properly
examine
the
question
to
see
whether
it
should
be
applied
in
particular
cases.
now,
there'd
be
many
cases,
of
course,
where
the
defendant,
the
prisoner,
would
decide
that
he
didn't
want,
after
serving
a
period
of
time,
to
have
his
case
opened
and
see
whether
he
would
get
a
greater
sentence
or
something
else
happen
to
him,
many
of
them
would
be
disposed
in
that
--
of
in
that
way.
others
would
be
disposed
of
by
the
conclusion
that
they,
after
considering
the
entire
matter,
didn't
care
to
have
them
reopened
any
way,
and
that
would
get
down
to
some
kind
of
hard
core
that
would
depend
upon
whether
they
did
have
a
fair
trial.
and
in
those
cases,
when
it's
shown
that
they
didn't
have
counsel
and
they
didn't
have
a
fair
trial
because
they
didn't
have
counsel
but
it
would
be
obvious
to
ask
for
it.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
interests
of
society
they
should
go
back
and
reexamine
to
see
that
they
did
have
a
fair
hearing
at
one
time
in
regard
to
the
charges
against
them.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
no,
i
don't
assume
that
it
could
not
be
made
prospective,
i
am
urging
--
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
i
am
urging
you
to
make
it
retrospective
in
my
argument.
mr.
j.
lee
rankin
well,
i
do
myself,
but
i
am
fearful
that
that's
more
personal
than
fundamental
constitutionality.
but
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
problem
if
you
determine
something
is
unconstitutional,
in
my
own
thinking,
to
not
apply
it
back
to
where
the
error
occurred.
i
know
there
are
those
who
have
advocated
to
the
contrary
but
for
myself,
i
do
not
accept
that
and
i
would
ask
that
you
go
back
to
the
point
where
the
error
occurred
and
correct
it.
