justice

j.
brennan,

well,
i
know
in
my
own
state,
mr.
fortas,
we
don't
recognize
this
thing
as
felony.
they're
high
misdemeanors
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
misdemeanors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
again
though,
how
do
you
measure
petty
offense?
for
example,
i
know
before
i
left
new
jersey,
we
downgraded
a
number
of
former
misdemeanors
to
something
we
called
“disorderly
person
offenses”.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
petty
offenses,
the
notion
being
that
in
that
way,
no
requirement
of
jury
trial
for
that.
but
conviction
for
some
of
those
can
bring
a
jail
sentence
up
to
a
year
and
a
fine,
as
i
remember
it
now
to
$1000.
is
that
a
petty
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
course,
that's
just
what
you're
asking
us
not
to
do.
that
becomes
more
of
this
ad
hoc
and
ex
post
facto
situation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
tell
me,
mr.
fortas,
would
there
be
anything
in
trying
to
measure
the
line
if
the
line
must
be
drawn
based
on
the
confinement
which
conviction
might
bring?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
in
other
words
restore
and
to
incorporate
by
some
other
way
to
get
into
trial.
