mr.
fortas,
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
you
can
answer
it
when
i
get
back.
i
attached
to
my
dissent
in
betts
versus
brady
a
study
made
after
much
hard
work
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
which
i
believed
then
and
believe
now
was
accurate,
which
had
said
this,
“states
which
require
that
indigent
defendants
in
noncapital
as
well
as
capital
criminal
cases
be
provided
with
counsel
by
request.”
i
stated
there
were
35.
what
i
would
like
to
know
is
if
there
are
only
35
now,
have
some
of
those
before
betts
versus
brady
gone
back
to
the
betts
versus
brady
ruling,
or
what
has
happened?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
the
state
cases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
my
figure
was
limited
to
felony
or
penitentiary
offenses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
the
language
used
by
justice
cardozo?
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
to
understand
that
you
think
the
fifth
amendment's
guarantee
or
the
constitution's
guarantee
of
the
right
to
counsel
has
nothing
to
do
with
this?
it
solely
deals
with
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
that
you
lay
aside
the
federal
guarantee
of
the
right
to
counsel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
with
reference
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
what,
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
the
fourteenth
amendment
do
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
been
trying
to
say
that
the
courts
accepted
it
in
a
number
of
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i've
been
trying
to
think
that
the
courts
accepted
it
in
a
number
of
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
this
particular
one,
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
why
your
argument
of
federalism
doesn't
apply
alike
to
the
betts
and
brady
method
of
setting
aside
judgments
and
to
the
automatic
method?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
isn't
there
as
much
interference
with
the
state
in
one
instance
as
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
--
one
of
my
objections
to
betts
and
brady
is
that
it
does
impose
an
unfair
burden
on
the
states
in
that
it
leaves
them
uncertain
in
every
criminal
case
whether
it
will
come
up
here
and
the
facts
will
be
viewed
differently
to
the
way
the
facts
were
viewed
by
the
state
courts.
and
so
far
as
the
injury
to
federalism
is
concerned,
injury
to
the
states,
one
of
my
objections
to
betts
and
brady
has
been
just
that
that
the
state's
entitled
to
know
with
some
degree
of
certainty
what
they
can
do
to
comply
with
what
this
court
says
the
constitution
requires.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it's
clear?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
come
most
states
don't
know
what
circumstances
will
be
held
sufficient
after
we
review
them
several
years
after
your
states
view
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
it
doesn't
allow
you
the
freedom
--
if
habeas
corpus
turns
up
after
a
man's
gone
to
jail,
and
you
have
to
have
another
trial
and
you
don't
know
even
then
whether
the
district
judge's
judgment
will
be
taken
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
whether
we
will
accept
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
state
legislature
can't
decide
the
--
under
the
betts
and
brady
rule,
your
state
legislature
can't
decide
it.
this
court
has
to
finally
decide
whether,
looking
backwards
to
the
past,
sometimes
five
years,
circumstances
were
such
that
the
man
should
have
had
a
lawyer.
then
your
state
conviction
is
set
aside.
if
your
state
had
a
rule
under
which
it
could
act,
it
would
interfere
with
it,
it
seems
to
me,
far
less
than
the
method
of
ex
post
facto
review
of
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
can
the
state
legislature
determine
it?
the
rule
is,
under
betts
and
brady,
that
it
has
to
come
up
to
the
federal
court,
and
this
court
has
to
determine
the
circumstances
for
itself.
it
doesn't
leave
it
to
your
legislature.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it's
not
final,
under
betts
and
brady.
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
agree
about
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
assumed
that
a
man
who
has
been
in
jail
a
lot
of
times
and
been
tried
a
lot
of
times
becomes
a
lawyer
from
that?
i
would
think
that
group
of
people
are
probably
about
as
little
capable
of
taking
care
of
themselves
as
any
group
you
could
get.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wasn't
put
on
that
basis,
was
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
intimation
that
it
was
on
that
basis
either
in
the
argument
or
the
court's
opinion?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
can
assure
you
that's
the
first
time
i
ever
thought
about
it
in
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
historical
support
do
you
find
in
history,
back
before
the
early
days,
for
thinking
that
a
man
who
is
charged
with
a
crime
for
which
he
might
be
only
sentenced
to
life
or
sentenced
to
50
years
was
any
less
entitled
to
a
fair
trial
than
the
man
who
might
be
executed?
what
historical
support
do
you
find
for
that,
in
your
studies
of
history
in
this
field?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
historical
support
do
you
find
outside
of
what's
crept
into
some
opinions
in
the
last
few
years,
that
a
man
is
any
less
entitled
to
a
fair
trial
who
is
charged
with
a
noncapital
offense
and
might
lose
his
liberty
than
a
man
who
is
charged
with
a
capital
offense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
can't
either.
it
was
the
reason
i
asked
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
most
people
are
fearful
about
being
put
in
jail,
in
the
penitentiary,
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
arguing
that
we
should
draw
such
a
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
understand
johnson
and
zerbst
held
with
reference
to
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
without
exception?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
wouldn't
feel
that
the
court
should
hold
that
the
constitution
permits
the
government
to
force
a
lawyer
on
a
man
who
objects
to
having
him,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
anybody
would
go
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
to
decide
cases.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
anybody
would
go
that
far
to
decide
cases,
because
there
are
some
defendants
who
are
pretty
smart.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wouldn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
the
local
bar
association.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
there
be
difficulty
in
showing
whether
he
had
counsel
or
not?
i
understood
you
to
say
there
were
5,200
in
jail
whom
the
record
showed
did
not
have
counsel.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
would
be
difficult
then
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
i
see.
you're
talking
the
retrial.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
were
also
talking
about
the
difficulty
of
proving
that
he
might
have
waived
counsel
at
arraignment.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
not
very
complimentary
to
our
profession,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
states
and
the
federal
government
shouldn't
hire
lawyers
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
the
states
and
the
federal
government
shouldn't
hire
lawyers
and
prosecutors.
