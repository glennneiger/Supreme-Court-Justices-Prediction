mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
members
of
the
court.
i
am
bruce
jacob
from
the
attorney
general's
office
of
florida,
representing
the
respondent.
with
me
at
the
counsel
table
is
mr.
george
d.
mentz,
who
is
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
alabama.
the
state
of
alabama
has
filed
an
amicus
brief,
together
with
the
state
of
north
carolina,
on
our
behalf
and
mr.
mentz
has
been
allowed
20
minutes
of
my
time.
at
the
outset,
i
would
briefly
like
to
explain
the
procedure
followed
by
the
florida
supreme
court
when
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
is
presented
to
that
tribunal.
the
florida
supreme
court
does
not
stand
on
formalities.
any
scrap
of
paper
which
comes
to
its
attention
which
alleges
any
facts
whatsoever
that
raise
a
constitutional
issue
or
raise
a
probable
cause
question
as
to
whether
that
defendant
is
legally
or
illegally
held,
it
is
treated
as
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
by
the
florida
supreme
court.
of
course,
if
the
petition
does
not
have
--
does
not
raise
any
justiciable
issue
whatsoever,
the
court
denies
the
petition
on
its
face.
if
a
justiciable
issue
is
raised,
the
court
will
issue
a
writ
and
require
our
office,
the
office
of
the
attorney
general,
to
file
a
return.
in
right
to
counsel
cases,
when
the
question
of
denial
of
counsel
is
raised
by
a
petition,
it
is
our
policy
in
the
attorney
general's
office
to
attach
a
transcript
of
the
trial
proceedings
to
show
the
court
or
give
the
court
a
chance
to
look
at
the
trial
proceedings
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
defendant
received
a
fair
trial.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
that
may
be
true,
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
in
our
experience
we
have
--
we
haven't
made
any
studies
of
that,
your
honor,
so
i
really
couldn't
say,
but
it
may
well
be
true;
but
we
haven't
made
any
studies
to
that
effect.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
your
honor,
in
a
noncapital
case,
he
could
not
have
appointed
counsel
who
would
have
been
compensated.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
right.
he
could
have
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
that's
right,
your
honor.
our
state,
the
judges
in
our
state
have
discretion
and
they
can
appoint
counsel
when
exceptional
circumstances
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
are
some
judges
who
appoint
counsel
in
all
case.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
and
generally,
that
is
in
the
more
urban
areas.
in
the
rural
areas
where
there
are
fewer
lawyers,
and
especially
fewer
criminal
lawyers
available,
the
courts
have
many
times
not
appointed
counsel
as
often
as
they
do
in
urban
areas.
now,
this
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
your
honor,
there
may
be.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
cases
and
i'm
--
there
may
only
be
one
reported
case
that
holds
that,
but
many
trial
courts
appoint
counsel
when
they
see
special
circumstances.
this
trial
--
this
particular
trial
judge
in
this
case
misquoted
the
law
on
the
--
according
to
the
transcript
which
has
been
filed
with
the
court.
he
said,
“sorry,
mr.
gideon,
i
cannot
appoint
counsel
for
you
except
in
a
capital
case.”
now,
on
its
face,
that
appears
to
be
a
misstatement
of
the
law
because
florida
does
follow
betts
versus
brady,
and
in
florida,
a
man
is
entitled
to
counsel
if
he
can
show,
if
he
is
indigent
and
also
he
is
ignorant,
illiterate
or
incompetent
in
some
way.
since
our
brief
has
been
printed,
i
have
received
a
letter
from
the
trial
judge
who
handled
this
case.
i
asked
him
what
happened
at
arraignment
because
i
just
couldn't
believe
that
a
judge
would
make
this
statement
at
the
trial
without
examining
the
man
and
finding
out
whether
he
really
was
incompetent
or
unable
to
handle
his
own
defense.
and
judge
mccurry
wrote
back
and
said
this.
he
said,
“i
do
remember
the
arraignment
of
this
defendant
and
also
that
he
asked
for
counsel
at
arraignment
and
on
the
date
of
trial.
he
was
advised
that
when
a
person
appears
to
have
the
mental
ability
to
interview
witnesses
and
present
testimony
to
the
jury,
the
practice
of
appointing
counsel
is
not
followed
except
in
capital
cases.
after
talking
with
this
defendant,
it
was
my
opinion
that
he
had
both
the
mental
capacity
and
the
experience
in
the
courtroom
at
previous
trials
to
adequately
conduct
his
defense.”
this
was
later
borne
out
at
the
trial,
as
you
can
determine
from
examination
of
the
record
in
this
case.
i
will
leave
this
letter
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
in
case
any
of
the
justices
wish
to
examine
the
letter.
gideon
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
florida
supreme
court
which
did
not
allege
any
circumstance
whatsoever
which
would
entitle
him
to
counsel
under
the
rule
of
betts
versus
brady,
and
therefore
the
florida
supreme
court
properly
denied
his
petition.
mr.
fortas,
in
his
designations
for
printing,
asked
that
the
trial
transcript
and
other
matters
which
were
not
before
the
florida
supreme
court
be
included
in
the
transcript.
we
moved
to
strike
those
designations
for
printing,
but
our
motion
was
denied.
we
take
the
position
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
your
honor,
the
florida
supreme
court
denies
a
petition
on
its
face
if
it
does
not
raise
any
question
of
law
which
is
raised
by
the
petition.
if
a
justiciable
issue
is
raised,
if
there
is
some
question
about
whether
the
petitioner
is
legally
held,
they
will
issue
a
writ
and
require
our
office,
the
attorney
general's
office,
to
file
a
return.
we
will
file
a
return,
and
if
the
right
to
counsel
is
involved
it
has
been
our
practice
to
attach
a
transcript
of
the
trial
proceedings
so
that
the
supreme
court
can
determine
whether
the
man
had
a
fair
trial.
and
if
the
court
cannot
determine
from
our
return
and
from
the
petition
whether
the
man
is
entitled
to
release,
many
times
they
will
appoint
a
commissioner
and
hold
a
hearing.
we
take
the
position
in
this
proceeding
that
the
trial
transcript
and
record
which
constitute
pages
1
through
44
of
the
transcript
of
record
in
this
case
are
in
the
transcript
of
record
for
informational
purposes
only.
we
take
the
position
that
if
this
court
were
to
base
its
decision
in
this
case
upon
any
matters
which
are
contained
on
pages
1
through
44,
it
would
be
exceeding
its
jurisdiction
because
under
the
statute
under
which
jurisdiction
is
invoked
in
this
case,
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
judgments
of
state
courts.
this
trial
transcript
and
proceedings
do
not
constitute
a
judgment.
they
were
not
included
in
the
judgment
of
the
florida
supreme
court
because
it
was
not
before
the
florida
supreme
court.
so
we
take
the
position
that
these
matters
are
in
the
transcript
for
informational
purposes
only.
but
since
the
petitioner
has
seen
fit
to
include
them
in
the
transcript
of
record
in
this
case,
we've
seen
fit
to
supplement
the
record,
too,
for
informational
purposes.
for
instance,
in
our
brief
we
pointed
out
that
this
man
is
50
years
old.
he's
a
white
male,
has
been
convicted
of
four
prior
felonies,
three
of
which
included
burglary
in
some
form
or
another.
he's
had
experience,
work
experience,
as
an
auto
electrician.
and
in
addition
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
okay,
your
honor,
i
was
--
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
the
court
did
not
rule
upon
the
transcript
as
it
appears
in
this
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
okay,
your
honor,
i'll
proceed
with
our
argument
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
the
petition
and
the
denial
constituted
final
judgment,
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
no,
your
honor.
before
getting
into
the
argument
on
betts
versus
brady,
i'd
like
to
briefly
outline
our
argument
on
this
point.
first
of
all,
i'm
going
to
point
out
that
historically,
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
for
including
the
right
to
automatic
appointment
of
counsel
in
noncapital
cases
in
the
due
process
clause.
secondly,
i'd
like
to
indicate
to
the
court
that
due
process,
the
term
“due
process,”
as
it
has
been
developed
by
this
court
in
many
cases
since
the
civil
war,
is
a
relative
and
not
an
absolute
concept.
and
therefore,
this
court
cannot
impose
an
inflexible
rule
requiring
appointment
in
all
felony
cases
or
in
all
criminal
cases,
for
that
matter.
next,
i'll
discuss
the
question
of
federalism
and
attempt
to
show
the
court
that
imposition
of
an
inflexible
rule
in
this
area
would
be
an
unwarranted
intrusion
into
historic
rights
of
the
states
to
determine
their
own
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
i'll
also
point
out
that
although
the
majority
of
the
states
now
do
provide
for
automatic
appointment
in
cases
less
than
capital,
the
states
that
do
that
do
so
by
court
rule
and
by
statute
and
not
by
constitutional
construction.
in
fact,
there
are
only
about
11
cases
--
about
11
jurisdictions
that
i
can
count
that
have
required
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
cases
less
than
capital
as
an
automatic,
fundamental
requirement
under
their
constitutions.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
because,
your
honor,
this
court
has
power
to
review
decisions
of
state
courts
when
state
courts
have
treated
a
defendant
unfairly.
and
in
many
cases
--
in
some
cases,
the
state
courts
do
treat
a
man
unfairly
if
he
is
not
represented
by
counsel,
but
in
other
cases,
he
is
not
treated
unfairly.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
because
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
your
honor,
i
don't
think
betts
versus
brady
is
that
unclear.
i
think
it's
inconsistent
in
the
same
way
that
the
entire
common
law
is
inconsistent.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
your
honor,
it's
progressive
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
each
time
this
court
decides
a
case,
that
adds
a
new
special
circumstance
which
we
must
consider
in
determining
whether
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
counsel.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
your
honor,
we
contend
that
it's
--
we
prefer
that
this
court
do
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis
than
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
in
the
last
few
years,
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
we
contend
that
it
would
be
better
for
this
court
to
review
them
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
it
still
allows
us
some
freedom
to
impose
our
own
criminal
procedure
rules.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
your
honor,
those
are
questions
which
should
be
decided
by
our
state
legislature
or
by
our
state,
but
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
perhaps
it
would
be
better
for
the
state
to
do
it,
i
don't
know,
but
that
is
a
matter
for
the
state
legislature
to
determine.
and
we
feel
that
if
this
court
were
to
impose
its
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
our
state
supreme
court
also
determines
these
special
circumstances,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
well,
the
average
judge
in
florida
who
reads
your
cases
plus
the
florida
supreme
court
cases
has
a
standard
to
follow.
it
may
not
be
entirely
clear
--
it
may
not
be
exactly
precise
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
it
may
not
be
precise,
but
we'd
rather
have
it
that
way
because
we
feel
the
state
still
has
the
power
to
determine
its
own
rules
of
procedure.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
your
honor,
are
you
speaking
of
lawyers
for
the
state
or
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
well,
every
--
the
members
of
the
criminal
division
of
the
attorney
general's
office,
which
constitutes
seven
men,
plus
every
state
attorney
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
--
in
the
state,
which
amounts
to
--
in
area
system,
which
amounts
to
--
it
amounts
to
something
like
60
or
70
men,
i
imagine,
approximately
60
or
70
men.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
the
only
movement
have
been
movements
by
individual
counties
to
impose
rules
which
would
apply
only
(inaudible)
so
far,
to
date,
there
have
only
been
movements
by
certain
counties,
delegations
from
certain
counties
which
have
asked
the
legislature
to
impose,
to
pass
laws
requiring
the
setting
up
of
a
public
defender
system.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
we
have
about
four
counties
which
have
public
defender
systems,
and
also
some
of
these
statutes
which
set
up
public
defender
systems
are
general
laws
of
local
application
and
other
counties
can
grow
into
those
population
brackets.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
my
observation
is
that
it
--
in
all
honesty,
my
observation
is
that
there
are
some
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
--
but
i
have
no
idea
how
many.
but
i
think
in
general,
the
judges
in
florida
do
make
a
very
careful
observation
of
every
defendant
that
comes
before
them.
and
as
i
said,
many
judges
are
now
at
the
point
where
they
provide
counsel
in
every
single
instance.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
i
can't
say
they
always
do,
your
honor,
because
there
are
some
--
they
do
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
if
the
judge
knows
that
he's
illiterate
or
incompetent
in
some
way,
from
his
own
observation,
he
does
appoint
counsel.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
they
do,
and
here's
the
way
they
do
it:
they
spend
perhaps
15,
20
minutes
asking
him
questions
about
his
work
experience,
about
his
past
history,
his
education,
his
experience
in
life,
whether
he's
been
convicted
before
and
how
much
experience
he's
had
in
court.
in
other
words,
they
try
to
follow
the
rules
that
have
been
set
down
by
this
court
in
the
cases
since
betts
versus
brady.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
that
circumstance
in
and
of
itself
does
not,
of
course
--
that
circumstance
in
and
of
itself
does
not
mean
that
a
man
can
handle
his
own
defense,
but
it
certainly
has
a
bearing
on
the
question.
going
back
to
the
history
of
this
thing,
i'd
like
to
show
that
historically
there's
no
basis
for
imposing
the
federal
rule
on
the
states.
justice
cardozo
said
in
schneider
versus
massachusetts
that
due
process
--
before
i
get
to
that,
before
the
federal
constitution
was
adopted
in
1790
or
1791,
the
right
to
counsel
meant
the
right
to
employ
counsel.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
even
the
legal
writers
on
the
subject,
such
as
professor
beanie,
agree
that
before
the
bill
of
rights
was
adopted
the
right,
included
only
the
right
to
employ
counsel.
in
johnson
versus
zerbst,
this
court
decided
that
in
the
federal
court
system
every
man
was
entitled
to
counsel
unless
he
waived
that
right.
and
we
take
the
position
that
in
johnson
versus
zerbst,
this
court,
although
it
proceeded
by
construing
the
sixth
amendment,
we
take
the
position
that
this
court
had
in
mind,
at
least
to
some
extent
that
the
supervisory
powers
of
this
court
over
the
federal
--
the
inferior
courts
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
it
wasn't
put
on
that
basis,
your
honor,
but
we
can
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
no,
your
honor,
it
wasn't,
but
generally,
when
a
court
construes
the
constitution,
they
go
into
history
in
the
intention
of
the
framers.
in
that
case,
the
court
did
not
go
into
the
history
of
the
provision,
it
did
not
go
into
the
intention
of
the
framers,
so
we
feel
that
at
least
this
court
took
cognizance
of
its
supervisory
powers
and
knew
that
it
could
impose
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
we
may
be
wrong,
your
honor.
this
is
our
own
position
in
the
case,
and
we
feel
that
--
we
at
least
feel
that
this
might
have
been
the
case.
now,
justice
cardozo
said
in
schneider
versus
massachusetts
that
due
process
requires
that
the
proceedings
shall
be
fair,
but
fairness
is
a
relative
not
an
absolute
concept.
it
is
fairness
with
reference
to
particular
conditions
or
particular
results.
the
due
process
clause
does
not
impose
upon
the
states
a
duty
to
establish
ideal
systems
for
the
administration
of
justice
with
every
modern
improvement
and
with
provision
against
every
possible
hardship
that
may
befall.
what
is
fair
in
one
set
of
circumstances
may
be
an
act
of
tyranny
in
others.
this
concept
of
relativity
has
been
followed
in
every
case
before
and
since
lisenba
versus
california
comments
on
it.
and
at
the
present
time,
the
concept
of
due
process
means
that
this
court
will
take
into
consideration
the
totality
of
factors
in
every
single
case.
and
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
just
one
of
these
circumstances
which
the
court
must
take
into
consideration.
there
are
recent
cases
which
say
the
pattern
of
due
process
is
picked
out
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case.
powell
versus
alabama
was
decided
on
the
circumstances
of
that
case.
it
did
not
lay
down
an
inflexible
rule
in
all
capital
cases.
so,
historically,
under
the
definition
of
due
process
as
it's
been
formulated
by
this
court,
due
process
cannot
be
an
absolute
requirement.
we
cannot
have
a
fixed
rule
requiring
appointment
of
counsel
in
these
cases
and
not
in
those
cases.
we
cannot
draw
an
inflexible
dividing
line
anywhere.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
in
betts
versus
brady
no
mention
was
made,
no
distinction
was
made
between
capital
and
noncapital
cases,
your
honor.
i
realize
that
since
that
case,
legal
writers
and
judges
have
cited
betts
versus
brady
for
the
proposition
that
an
inflexible
rule
exists
in
capital
cases
and
not
in
noncapital
cases,
but
i
couldn't
--
in
reading
betts
versus
brady,
not
in
one
place
is
there
the
word
“capital”
or
non
--
or
as
opposed
to
“noncapital.”
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
powell
versus
alabama
was
decided
on
the
circumstances
in
that
case,
your
honor.
there,
the
court
held
that
in
a
capital
case
where
a
man
can
show
that
he
is
illiterate,
ignorant
or
incapable
of
handling
his
own
defense,
he
should
have
counsel
appointed
for
him.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
i'm
not
sure
that
hamilton
versus
alabama
does
say
that,
your
honor.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
state
court
finding
that
the
man
was
entitled
to
counsel
because
the
state
court
appointed
counsel
for
a
man
and
he
was
arraigned
on
a
charge
of
burglary.
that
charge
was
then
dropped
and
then
he
was
arraigned
on
a
capital
charge
and
the
counsel
was
not
present.
and
two
days
later,
the
same
counsel
who
had
been
previously
appointed
was
appointed
for
him
on
that
capital
charge.
and
we
take
the
position
that
hamilton
merely
says
that
when
the
state
court
has
already
determined
that
a
man
is
entitled
to
counsel.
in
a
state
court
procedure,
an
arraignment
is
very
difficult
and
very
complex.
the
man
should
have
counsel
at
the
arraignment
stage.
i
realize
that
this
court
has
many
times
drawn
the
distinction
between
capital
and
noncapital
cases,
but
betts
versus
brady
did
not
say
that,
powell
versus
alabama
did
not
say
that
and
in
the
cases
that
have
followed
since
betts,
this
statement
has
been
made
as
a
matter
of
dicta,
generally.
it
has
not
been
included
in
the
holding
of
the
court.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
the
question.
what
historical
support
is
there
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
your
honor,
i
can't
think
of
any
historical
--
i'm
not
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
if
--
i
think
if
--
i
don't
think,
first
of
all,
to
take
the
position
that
this
court
has
not
drawn
an
absolute
rule
--
i
think
the
rule
exists
between
capital
and
noncapital
cases
only
because
all
the
states
which
have
capital
cases
also
provide
for
appointment
of
counsel.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
as
i
understand
it,
the
rule
of
betts
versus
brady
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
the
rule
of
powell
and
betts
is
that
in
any
criminal
case
a
man
is
entitled
to
counsel
if
he
can
show
special
circumstances
which
show
that
he
would
be
denied
a
fair
trial
without
counsel.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
i
don't
think
there's
been
a
holding
to
that
effect.
i
know
it's
been
said
many
times.
but
either
if
there
is,
assuming
that
there
is
a
rule,
an
inflexible
rule
in
capital
cases,
we
feel
that
that
is
the
logical
place
to
draw
the
line.
there's
very
little
distinction
between
a
misdemeanor
and
a
noncapital
felony.
for
instance,
in
florida,
for
some
misdemeanors,
you
can
be
placed
in
the
county
jail
for
five
years,
while
for
a
felony,
you
can
go
to
the
state
prison
for
one
year
or
more.
so,
in
florida,
for
instance,
there
is
very
little
distinction
between
the
two
in
many
cases.
five
years
in
the
county
jail
is
much
different
than
one
year
or
five
years
in
the
state
prison.
also,
the
states
have
drawn
so
many
distinctions
between
capital
and
noncapital
cases
that
we
feel
that
if
there
is
an
inflexible
rule
in
capital
cases
that
that
is
the
logical
place
to
draw
the
distinction.
in
capital
cases
--
well,
capital
cases
are
a
creature
all
to
themselves.
they
just
are
unlike
any
other
case
because
everybody
is
fearful
of
being
put
to
death
by
electrocution
or
some
other
means.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
they
are
fearful
of
that,
too,
but
it's
nothing
like
being
put
to
death,
your
honor.
when
you're
put
in
jail
for
a
few
years,
there's
always
a
chance
that
you'll
get
out
on
probation
or
parole.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
i'm
arguing
that
you
shouldn't
draw
such
a
line
under
the
due
process
clause.
but
if
you
do,
that
is
the
logical
place
to
draw
it,
between
capital
and
noncapital
cases.
if
the
due
pro
--
if
the
sixth
amendment
as
it's
presently
construed
in
johnson
versus
zerbst
is
to
be
incorporated
or
absorbed
into
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
rule
would
have
to
extend
to
all
misdemeanors
because
the
sixth
amendment
just
says
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
counsel.
and
of
course,
misdemeanors
are
crimes.
i
don't
see
how
the
court
could
draw
a
distinction;
they'd
have
to
provide
lawyers
in
all
crimes
no
matter
how
minute
or
how
small
they
are.
this
would
place
a
tremendous
burden
upon
the
taxpayers
of
every
state.
it
would
be
foolish
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
johnson
versus
zerbst
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
meant
you
are
entitled
to
counsel
in
every
single
case.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
without
exception,
because
the
sixth
amendment
doesn't
make
any
differentiation
between
different
types
of
crimes.
the
main
point,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
argument
for
the
petitioner
is
that
it's
impossible
to
get
a
fair
trial
without
counsel.
that
seems
to
be
the
main
point
that
they
rely
upon.
this,
of
course,
is
not
true,
because
if
a
judge
takes
care
of
a
man,
sees
to
it
that
he's
--
that
inadmissible
evidence
is
not
admitted,
takes
care
of
him
throughout
the
trial,
he
can
receive
a
fair
trial.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
we
do,
your
honor,
if
the
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
because
those
cases
which
decide
--
where
the
judge
has
taken
too
large
a
part
in
the
trial
are
decided
on
the
circumstances
in
those
cases,
and
there
the
judge
took
complete
charge
of
the
trial
and
didn't
let
the
defense
attorney.
they
are
the
man
usually
had
an
attorney.
in
fact,
in
every
case
that
i
can
recall,
the
man
had
an
attorney.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
it
has
the
right
of
appeal
in
certain
circumstances,
not
from
a
judgment
of
conviction,
though.
it
has
the
right
of
appeal
from
a
denial
of
a
motion
or
the
granting
of
a
motion
for
new
trial.
that's
one
instance
i
can
think
of.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
no,
it
wouldn't;
it
doesn't
have
the
right
of
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
your
honor,
i'm
getting
to
a
point
that
i
think
will
answer
that.
the
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
the
petitioner
seems
to
base
his
entire
argument
on
the
proposition
that
a
man
just
cannot
receive
a
fair
trial,
or
at
least
generally,
he
just
cannot
receive
a
fair
trial
without
counsel.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
even
under
the
federal
rule,
even
under
johnson
versus
zerbst,
a
man
can
defend
himself
if
he
waives
his
right
to
counsel
and
decides
to
handle
his
own
defense.
to
me,
that
shows
that
a
man
can
get
a
fair
trial.
if
he
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial
by
handling
his
own
defense,
then
i
think
that
this
court
should
require
that
every
single
man
in
any
criminal
case
must
have
counsel,
whether
he
waives
it
or
not.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
his
right
to
a
fair
trial.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
that's
possible,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
i
don't
think
it
should,
but
i
think
that
the
fact
that
a
man
can
stand
trial
by
himself
does
show
that
at
least
this
court
isn't
too
concerned
about
a
man
not
being
able
to
receive
a
fair
trial.
i
think
there
are
circumstances
where
he
can
receive
a
fair
trial.
if
he
just
couldn't
possibly
receive
a
fair
trial
in
any
instance
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
--
i
don't
think
this
court
would
even
allow
him
to
waive
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
what
was
that,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
that's
precisely
our
point,
your
honor.
many
defendants
are
smart,
and
it
shows
up
every
day
in
our
handling
of
these
habeas
corpus
petitions.
some
of
these
men
know
exactly
what
they're
doing,
and
there's
no
problem
in
raising
special
circumstances.
this
is
the
only
petition
i've
ever
seen
where
they
didn't
set
out
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
usually,
they
just
go
on
and
on
and
tell
everything
that
happened.
and
usually,
it
raises
a
question
that
must
be
decided
by
requiring
a
return
and
a
hearing,
in
some
instances.
by
imposing
an
inflexible
rule
in
all
criminal
cases,
we
feel
that
this
court
would
be
intruding
into
a
field
that
has
been
historically
reserved
for
the
states.
ever
since
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
adopted,
this
court
has
in
one
case
after
another,
pointed
out
that
a
state
can
abolish
the
jury
trial,
trial
by
jury,
if
it
wishes.
it
doesn't
have
to
follow
the
specific
guarantees
of
the
sixth
amendment.
there's
one
case
that
says
that
a
state
can
adopt
a
civil
law
if
it
wishes.
a
state
should
be
free
to
adopt
any
system
it
wants.
if
it
wants,
it
should
be
able
to
do
away
with
the
need
for
a
prosecutor.
perhaps
a
judge
could
handle
the
whole
trial.
i'm
not
urging
this,
but
i'm
saying
that
the
court
--
that
the
states
have
the
right
to
do
this.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
in
other
words,
if
this
court
were
to
impose
an
inflexible
rule
that
counsel
must
be
appointed
in
all
felony
cases
or
in
all
criminal
cases,
it
would
be
discouraging
the
state
from
experimenting
and
adopting
the
types
of
rules
and
procedures
that
it
feels
are
necessary.
it
would
be
discouraging
the
state
from
adopting
fair
rules
as
well
as
unfair.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
lay
down
a
rule
which
discourages
the
state
from
adopting
an
unfair
rule
or
prevents
them
from
adopting
a
rule
that
is
unfair
in
every
situation,
i
could
see
some
reason
for
it.
but
if
this
court
adopts
a
rule
that
prevents
the
state
from
promulgating
fair
rules
as
well
as
unfair,
i
think
the
court
is
stepping
into
the
field
of
state
legislation.
one
problem
that
couldn't
be
covered
by
the
--
even
if
this
court
does
lay
down
an
inflexible
rule
would
be
the
problem
of
adequate
representation.
our
study
of
the
cases
which
have
been
reported
in
recent
years
show
that
that
has
become
the
big
problem,
not
the
problem
of
whether
a
man
actually
had
counsel
or
not
but
the
big
problem
is
whether
he
had
adequate
representation.
now,
just
because
we
impose
an
inflexible
rule
requiring
appointment
in
all
cases
that
does
not
mean
that
a
man
is
going
to
have
an
adequate
trial.
we
feel
that
in
some
cases
where
a
man
is
competent,
he
can
give
himself
an
adequate
representation.
in
some
cases,
of
course,
he
can't,
and
in
those
cases,
he
should
have
counsel
appointed
for
him.but
we
feel
that
the
line,
if
any
line
is
to
be
drawn,
it
should
be
drawn
on
the
basis
of
whether
a
man
has
had
adequate
representation.
and
of
course,
i
think
he
can
have
adequate
representation
even
though
he
represents
himself
in
some
instances.
it
would
be
absurd
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor.
gideon
could
--
if
a
man
came
into
court
and
said,
i
want
to
be
defended
by
gideon,
then
certainly
the
court
would
not
object.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
i'm
sorry,
your
honor;
that
was
a
stupid
answer.
if
this
rule
is
imposed
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
think
it
would
result
in
a
number
of
absurd
situations.
for
instance,
if
we
required
that
all
--
that
counsel
be
appointed
in
all
cases
as
a
necessary
requisite
of
equal
protection,
the
courts
or
the
states
would
also
be
required
to
appoint
counsel
in
civil
cases
because
a
man
who
has
money
can
be
represented
by
a
lawyer
in
civil
cases.
the
court
would
have
to
see
to
it
that
a
man
is
given
investigators,
that
he's
given
psychiatrists
and
expert
witnesses
if
he
wants
them,
because
those
things
are
available
to
the
man
who
has
money.
this
court
would
have
to
see
to
it
that
every
man
is
equally
entitled
to
bail,
that
the
state
would
have
to
give
him
money
for
bail
if
he
couldn't
afford
it.
this
court
would
have
to
require
that
all
states
provide
for
a
lawyer
on
appeal
or
in
post-conviction
proceedings
or
on
appeals
from
post-conviction
proceedings.
in
effect,
the
court
would
be
requiring
that
the
states
follow
a
program
of
socialism
or
would
be
requiring
that
the
states
adopt
a
welfare
program.
and
the
states,
we
feel,
should
be
allowed
to
adopt
that
program
themselves
if
they
want
to,
but
that
it
should
not
be
required
as
a
constitutional
requirement.
griffin
versus
illinois
does
not
constitute
grounds
for
making
this
a
right
under
the
equal
protection
clause
for
making
the
absolute
right
to
counsel
a
requirement
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
griffin,
the
court
said
that
a
state
cannot
discriminate
if
they
provide
for
transcripts
--
if
they
provide
that
no
one
can
receive
an
adequate
appeal
without
a
transcript,
they
cannot
bar
the
door
of
the
courtroom,
so
to
speak,
by
requiring
that
a
poor
man
pay.
it's
just
as
though
they
closed
the
door
on
him.
under
the
betts
versus
brady
doctrine,
a
man's
--
the
door
of
the
courtroom
may
be
closed
if
a
man
is
deaf
and
dumb
or
if
he
is
illiterate
or
ignorant
or
if
he's
incapable
of
handling
his
defense.
but
if
he
is
capable
of
handling
his
own
defense,
the
door
to
the
courtroom
is
not
closed.
also,
griffin
points
out
that
a
state
does
not
have
to
give
the
indigent
the
exact
same
treatment
which
the
rich
man
is
able
to
afford.
mr.
justice
black
said
that
the
state,
if
it
wished,
would
not
have
to
always
supply
transcripts
in
every
case.
it
could
find
other
ways
to
do
it.
in
other
words,
as
long
as
it
substantially
gives
a
man
the
same
protection
that
a
rich
man
is
given,
that
is
all
that
is
required
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
and
we
contend
that
a
man
does
get
substantial
protection
if
he's
competent
enough
to
handle
his
own
defense.
now,
counsel
for
petitioner
has
said
that
the
imposition
of
an
inflexible
rule
in
all
noncapital
cases
or
in
all
criminal
cases
would
create
less
--
would
mean
that
there
would
be
less
friction
between
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts.
justice
brandeis
once
said
that
separation
of
powers
was
adopted
in
the
constitution
not
to
promote
efficiency
but
to
preclude
the
exercise
of
arbitrary
power.
even
if
there
is
some
friction
created
between
federal
and
state
courts,
it
is
better
to
have
that
friction
than
to
allow
the
federal
courts
to
substitute
their
opinions
on
what
states
should
require
under
their
state
law.
in
their
briefs,
the
petitioner
and
the
amici
have
pointed
out
that
if
an
inflexible
rule
is
adopted,
there
will
be
much
fewer
--
there
will
be
fewer
petitions
in
this
court,
fewer
habeas
corpus
petitions,
fewer
petitions
for
certiorari.
that
position
is
a
fantasy
because
first
of
all,
if
an
inflexible
rule
is
set
down
by
this
court
and
it
is
made
retroactive,
immediately,
the
state
courts
and
this
court
will
be
flooded
with
a
number
of
petitions
from
prisoners
who
have
been
incarcerated
for
a
number
of
years.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
no,
your
honor,
because
historically
the
right
to
employ
counsel
has
always
been
present
and
i
don't
think
that
it
could
be
that.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
logically,
i
suppose
that
it
could
be
done.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
it
never
would
be
done,
it
wouldn't
even
be
considered
by
the
states,
i
don't
believe.
another
good
rule
for
--
another
good
reason
for
--
in
our
position
is
that
the
federal
system
which
has
been
adopted
by
this
court
has
not
worked
perfectly.
there
have
been
many
flaws
in
it.
for
instance,
a
newspaper
article
this
sunday
pointed
out
that
there
has
been
great
difficulty
in
procuring
lawyers
to
handle
all
of
these
defenses.
just
because
a
system
is
imposed
does
not
mean
that
there
won't
be
many
difficulties
in
getting
counsel
to
undertake
that
system.
as
to
this
matter
of
retroactivity,
or
making
this
decision
retroactive,
logically,
the
decision
would
have
to
be
retroactive
because
gideon
filed
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus,
which
is
a
collateral
attack.
so
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
the
case
and
impose
an
inflexible
rule
in
all
criminal
cases,
as
i
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
approximately
5,200
prisoners
would
be
at
least
eligible
to
be
set
free
under
the
new
rule.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
florida,
until
the
last
year
or
two,
has
not
required
that
transcripts
be
taken
--
in
fact,
they
still
do
not
require
that
transcripts
be
taken
at
arraignment
and
in
many
cases
it
would
be
difficult,
in
other
words,
to
get
information
to
show
that
a
man
had
waived
or
had
not
waived
his
right
to
counsel.
so,
many
of
these
men
would
be
entitled
to
be
set
free.
and
of
course,
you
say
they
may
be
retried,
but
that
would
be
difficult
in
many
cases
because
it's
difficult
to
get
information
for
an
offense
that
was
committed
many
years
ago.
in
fact,
it's
difficult
to
get
evidence
with
which
to
prosecute
a
man
even
when
he
was
convicted
only
a
few
months
ago,
in
many
instances.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
state
to
gather
--
to
marshal
its
evidence
to
retry
the
man.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
retrial,
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
that's
right.
difficulty
of
proving
that
he
has
waived
counsel
and
also
the
difficulty
in
retrying
the
man
so,
many
of
these
men
would
be
set
free.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
no,
your
honor,
because
we
do
not
follow
the
federal
rule.
the
judge
examines
the
man
himself
and
makes
a
determination
from
his
own
observations
as
to
whether
the
man
is
able
to
handle
his
own
defense.
even
if
a
man
asked
for
counsel,
that
doesn't
mean
he's
going
to
get
it.
it
depends
upon
whether
the
man
is
capable
of
handling
his
own
defense.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
they
are,
but
even
in
those
counties,
in
some
instances
the
public
defender
is
so
overworked
that
they
don't
provide
counsel
every
time
a
man
decides
to
plead
guilty.
sometimes
a
man
--
in
fact,
usually
the
case
is
that
a
man
can
plead
guilty
without
consulting
with
counsel
if
he
tells
the
judge
he
wants
to
plead
guilty.
they
don't
require
that
the
man
consult
with
counsel
before
he
enters
a
plea
of
guilty
because
there
aren't
enough
public
defenders
under
our
present
set-up
to
provide
lawyers
in
every
single
case,
whether
a
man
pleads
guilty
or
not
guilty.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
just
about,
your
honor.
dade
county
alone
has
a
million
people,
and
the
state
has
between
four
and
five
million,
i
believe.
so
dade
county
alone
has,
i
believe,
about
25%
of
the
population.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
well,
these
public
defender
systems
have
only
been
set
up
in
the
last
few
years.
the
hillsborough
system
was
set
up
by
the
1961
legislature,
for
instance.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
as
our
final
request,
we
urge
that
if
the
court
does
decide
to
reverse
this
case,
we
implore
the
court
to
find
some
way
to
not
make
the
rule
retroactive
because
the
state
of
florida
and
the
other
states
which
have
followed
the
betts
versus
brady
doctrine
have
done
so
in
good
faith.
they
have
followed
the
decisions
of
this
court
from
year
to
year
and
have
tried
their
best
to
apply
the
rule
which
has
been
followed
by
this
court.
they
followed
the
rule
in
good
faith,
and
therefore
we
respectfully
request
that
some
means
be
found
by
which
not
to
make
--
to
make
the
rule
nonretroactive.
i
have
cited
several
cases
in
my
brief
which
cite
the
problem
and
which
--
some
of
which
indicate
that
even
though
logically,
a
case
such
as
this
would
have
to
be
retroactive,
since
this
came
to
this
court
from
an
appeal
by
a
prisoner
to
the
state
supreme
court,
some
courts
have
seen
fit
to
cast
aside
the
legal
--
this
legal
fiction
and
have
made
a
new
rule
retroactive
as
to
the
one
particular
litigant
as
an
incentive,
so
to
speak,
to
other
litigants
who
might
desire
to,
who
might
have
questions
of
constitutionality
that
could
be
litigated.
so,
our
argument
turns
primarily
upon
the
doctrine
of
federalism.
we
feel
that
the
states
have
historically
always
had
power
to
provide
rules
of
procedure
in
their
own
courts.
this
court
has,
in
construing
the
due
process
clause,
has
always
said
that
it
is
a
relative,
not
an
absolute
concept.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
that
any
decision
laying
down
an
inflexible
rule
with
respect
to
felonies
or
all
criminal
cases
would
change
the
whole
concept
of
due
process
as
it
has
been
set
out
by
this
court.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
the
first
statute
was
the
statute
in
1789
or
1790
which
required
appointment
in
capital
cases.
are
you
speaking
of
the
present
rule
or
the
first
statute,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
i
believe
it
was
1944
or
--
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
--
about
that
time
that
the
rule
of
1944
was
adopted.
mr.
bruce
r.
jacob
yes,
your
honor.
