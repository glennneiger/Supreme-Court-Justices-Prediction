justice
john
m.
harlan
betts
and
brady
did
not
proceed
on
that
basis.
it
did
not
deny
the
obvious.
obviously,
a
man
is
not
represented
--
who
is
no
represented,
who
is
not
as
--
hasn't
had
as
good
a
shake
in
court
as
the
man
who
is
represented.
betts
and
brady
didn't
go
on
any
such
basis
as
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
understood
the
basis
of
betts
and
brady
to
be,
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
that
isn't
quite
so
simple
as
that
because
under
our
concepts
in
the
federal
system
apart
from
the
sixth
amendment.
we
would
consider
that
a
man
in
a
felony
case
hadn't
had
a
fair
shake
if
he
wasn't
tried
before
a
jury.
i
suppose
the
state
could
do
away
with
the
jury
trial
and
yet
you
wouldn't
say
this
trial
was
inherently
unfair,
would
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
you
got
to
argue
this
on
the
basis
of
federalism.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
believe
i
suggested
that,
i
don't
suppose
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
understandable
sensitivity
to
describe
a
basic
principle
of
our
government
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
very
happy
expression.
justice
john
m.
harlan
practically
all
the
states
have
recognized
that
so.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
they've
done
that
under
a
line
of
decisions
in
this
court
which,
at
least
so
far
as
--
would
have
permitted
an
opposite
conclusion.
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
as
i
understood
it,
you
said
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
how
far
you
would
--
whether
you
would
draw
the
line
at
any
point
in
appointment
of
counsel
if
betts
and
brady
were
overruled,
and
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you'd
make
the
right
as
to
types
of
cases
co-extensive
with
cases
in
which
the
right
to
counsel
of
your
own
selection
would
be
a
constitutional
requirement.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
any
type
of
case
where
a
state
could
deny
a
man
the
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
of
his
own
choice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
wouldn't
have
thought
so.
even
in
civil
cases,
i
don't
think
a
state
could
do
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
different
question
from
the
one
i
was
putting
to
you.
that
relates
to
the
time
of
appointment,
time
of
the
right
to
counsel.
i'm
asking
you
as
to
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
whether
you
can
draw
a
distinction
between
felony
cases,
misdemeanor
cases,
traffic
cases
or,
for
that
matter,
civil
cases,
if,
as
you
say,
you
would
make
the
right
co-extensive
with
the
right
to
counsel
of
your
own
choice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
are
the
two
cases
in
which
the
court
did
not
find
special
circumstances?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
at
339.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
what's
the
other
one?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
can't
remember
any
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
can't
remember
any
since
i've
been
here
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
where
we
failed
to
find
special
circumstances.
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
betts
and
brady
came
along,
would
you
have
thought
it
was
plain
that
if
congress
had
passed
a
law
saying
that
in
all
kinds
of
criminal
cases,
no
matter
what
kind,
the
states
would
have
to
provide
counsel
free
to
an
indigent,
would
you
think
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
law
is
constitutional
--
would
be
constitutional?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
betts
and
brady
was
what?
19
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
42.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
characteristic
and
an
example
of
the
workings
of
our
federalism
at
its
best.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
doesn't
take
every
--
it
doesn't
take
this
court's
decisions
to
reform
everybody
in
the
united
states
or
the
states.
they
come
to
these
things,
too.
justice
john
m.
harlan
maybe
not.
justice
john
m.
harlan
now,
the
civil
rights
cases
might
give
you
some
point
on
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
terribly
broad
generalization,
mr.
rankin.
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
are
many
cases
where
--
you've
had
them
and
i've
seen
them
and
advised
people
in
that
way
--
where
very
often
you
would
say
that
the
best
thing
that
a
client
could
do,
a
given
client
could
do,
is
to
go
and
try
his
case
himself.
you
see
it
every
day
in
this
court
in
forma
pauperis
cases.i'm
not
saying
that
there
isn't
force
to
your
argument,
but
to
make
a
sweeping
generalization
as
a
dogmatic
piece
of,
a
dogmatic
assertion
that
there
can
be
no
fair
trial
without
a
counsel
ignores
the
facts
of
life
that
everybody
--
lawyer
knows.
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
argument
that
you're
making
now
seems
to
assume
that
if
betts
and
brady
were
to
be
overruled
that
it
couldn't
be
made
prospective.
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
didn't
urge
that
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
see
any
constitutional
difficulty
in
the
way
of
making
it
prospective
only?
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
operation
of
your
florida
statute.
the
judge
said
that
he
couldn't
under
your
law
appoint
counsel
to
this
man.
does
that
mean
that
he
couldn't
appoint
counsel
that
would
be
compensated
by
the
state
or
does
it
mean
that
if
he
chosen
as
a
judge
of
the
court,
to
say,
“you,
mr.
x,
a
member
of
the
bar,
will
serve
this
man
without
compensation”,
that
he
couldn't
have
done
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
he
would
have
been
compensated?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
there's
nothing
in
your
law
that
prevents
the
judge
from
appointing
counsel
without
compensation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
there
some
that
do?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
cases.
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
do
you
have
to
waste
time
on
that?
because
mr.
fortas
is
not
contending
that
if
the
betts
and
brady
rule,
as
i
understand
him,
that
if
the
betts
and
brady
rule
is
adhered
to,
that
this
case
should
be
reversed.
justice
john
m.
harlan
his
position
is
that
we
are
faced
in
this
case
really
with
either
affirming,
adhering
to
betts
against
brady
or
overruling
it.
and
that's
the
only
premise
he's
argued
his
case
on.
justice
john
m.
harlan
has
your
bar
in
florida
ever
taken
a
position
on
this
with
reference
to
the
state
legislature?
has
there
been
any
movement
in
your
bar
to
do
what
most
other
states
have
done
to
get
modern
legislation
on
this
thing
to
see
that
counsels
are
provided?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
quite
true,
but
you've
got
to
recognize
that
in
substantive
cases
in
this
court
we
have
laid
down
an
absolute
rule
in
capital
cases.
hamilton
against
alabama
is
the
latest
expression
of
it
and
of
course
we
can't
argue
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
because
that's
what
you
thought.
justice
john
m.
harlan
when
was
the
federal
statute
requiring
the
appointment
of
counsel
first
passed,
do
you
know?
justice
john
m.
harlan
my
recollection
is
that
there
was
no
federal
statute
on
the
books
as
late
as
1940
that
required
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
appointment
of
counsel.
justice
john
m.
harlan
1944.
justice
john
m.
harlan
up
to
that
time,
the
betts
and
brady
philosophy
was
obtained
in
the
federal
system.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
would
be
your
--
this
is
pretty
speculative,
i
must
admit,
but
supposing
betts
and
brady
isn't
overruled,
what
are
you
for
--
how
many
years
is
it
going
to
take
alabama
to
pass
a
law
like
new
york
and
24
or
25
other
states?
justice
john
m.
harlan
there
is
debate
on
the
subject
in
alabama?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
bar?
justice
john
m.
harlan
naturally,
you
can't
be
a
soothsayer.
justice
john
m.
harlan
let
me
put
this
question
to
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
you
had
the
choice,
as
you
see
it,
representing
a
state,
of
maintaining
betts
and
brady
on
the
books,
and
then
having
a
succession
of
cases
in
this
court
where
in
every
instance
where
a
state
did
not
appoint
counsel,
the
case
is
brought
up
here
and
you
have
it
automatically
reversed,
finding
special
circumstances,
so
that
while
betts
and
brady
is
being
obeyed
in
form
paid
lip
service
to
any
discerning
person
would
know
that
unless
the
state
does
that,
the
case
is
coming
up
here
and
getting
reversed.
do
you
think
that
between
maintaining
that
kind
of
a
situation
and
just
getting
betts
and
brady
off
the
books,
which
would
you
think
was
the
better?
sitting
as
you
--
it's
your
responsibility
representing
the
state,
knowing
the
operation
of
your
courts.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
john
m.
harlan
even
though
you
know
they're
all
going
to
be
decided
the
one
way?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i'm
assuming.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
is
in
my
assumption.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
fortas,
in
your
studies
of
this
problem,
and
i
know
you've
thought
a
lot
about
it,
did
you
find,
come
across
any
errors
or
overstatements
of
the
parade
of
constitutional
history
that
mr.
justice
roberts
brought
to
bear
in
his
majority
opinion
in
support
of
the
conclusion
that
was
reached
by
the
court?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
left
with
is
to
get
your
hand
one
--
what
one
is
left
with
is
to
get
his
hands
on
something
that
has
happened
between
1942
and
1963
that
has
made
what
the
court
then
regarded
as
constitutional
suddenly
become
unconstitutional.
justice
john
m.
harlan
not
in
terms
of
the
generation,
not
in
terms
of
long
periods
of
history.
