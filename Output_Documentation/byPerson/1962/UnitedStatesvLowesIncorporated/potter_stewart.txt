the
case
doesn't
turn
on
it.
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
last
one,
i
misunderstood?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
the
purchasers
or
the
licensees
in
every
case
where
individual
stations
rather
than
networks,
were
they?
justice
potter
stewart
with
the
national
network.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
friedman,
before
you
go
on,
if
you
will,
could
you
return
a
moment
to
the
argument
you're
making
at
the
time
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
you
some
questions
to
the
effect
that
this
practice
of
loew's
insisting
and
if
they
take
all
723
when
the
station
only
wanted
500,
excluded
competitors
from
the
market,
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
who
would
be
the
competing
sellers?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
you
just
told
mr.
justice
white
that
each
one
of
these
pictures
is
unique.
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
--
where
is
the
competition?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
each
is
uniquely
bad
no
matter
how
many
of
them
would
sell
that.
justice
potter
stewart
but
they
don't
say
that,
do
they?
they
say
we
want
these
500
and
not
those
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
don't
want.
they
don't
say,
"we
just
want
500
chosen
at
random
from
the
723."
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
--
i
don't
understand
the
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
transportation
is
not
unique.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there's
another
way
of
looking
at
this
whole
transaction
and
that
is
that
loew's
have
said
this,
you
have
500
pictures
and
these
500
pictures
will
cost
you
$500,000.00
and
we're
going
to
be
very
kind
and
show
him
223
more.
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
we've
been
talking
mostly
about
the
loew's
and
that
involved
their
whole
library
of
723
pictures
but
most
of
these
--
most
of
these
transactions
here
involved
about
30
or
40
or
50
that
general
area
of
magnitude
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
--
that
a
--
the
owner
of
these
pictures
that
distributed
these
pictures
couldn't
say
that
we
sell
them
only
by
a
minimum
of
half
a
dozen.
it's
not
worth
our
time
and
the
time
of
our
lawyers
and
everything
else
just
to
say
--
that
we
sell
them
a
minimum
of
six,
any
six
you
want,
they
couldn't
say
that?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
answer
to
mr.
goldberg
suggested
that
you
would
say
that
that
was
a
violation.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
station
wants
six,
could
they
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
he
cannot?
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
--
the
30
or
40
didn't
--
not
include
any
selznick,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
did.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
after
that,
the
price
was
$61,000
for
46,
how
long
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
was
in
the
course
of
the
same
negotiation.
