mr.
justin
m.
golenbock
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
as
counsel
for
national
telefilm
associates
or
nta,
i
shall
direct
my
remarks
during
the
few
minutes
available
to
me
in
opposition
to
the
appeal
of
the
government
in
case
number
42.
this
appeal
has
been
taken
by
the
government
in
the
five
other
cases
in
identical
fashion
as
taken
against
nta.
the
first
question
raised
by
the
government
--
mr.
justin
m.
golenbock
yes
we
do,
sir.
and
the
first
question
that
was
raised
by
the
government
on
its
appeal
is
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
district
court
judge
erred
in
permitting
a
television
distributor
in
canvassing
a
market
in
respect
to
the
acquisition
of
or
distribution
of
a
package
of
films
before
licensing
anyone
or
few
in
that
group
to
a
willing
purchaser.
this
question
arose
primarily
in
connection
with
the
contract
which
nta
entered
with
a
minneapolis
television
station.
and
i
do
want
to
mention
this
contract
because
i
think
it
bears
somewhat
on
the
ultimate
determination
of
this
point.
in
that
case,
it
became
known
into
the
trades
that
nta
had
available
a
certain
number
of
feature
films
which
it
called
the
fabulous
40.
and
the
minneapolis
station
contacted
management
of
nta
and
requested
that
management
to
first
negotiate
with
the
minneapolis
station
before
going
to
its
competitors.
in
response
to
that
request,
the
nta
salesman
approached
the
minneapolis
station
and
conducted
negotiations.
in
the
course
of
the
negotiations,
the
station
asked
whether
or
not
it
would
be
possible
to
obtain
fewer
than
a
total
group
of
films.
nta
required
not
yet
indicating
that
it
wanted
to
solicit
the
market,
to
have
an
opportunity
to
talk
to
the
competitors
first.
thereafter,
a
contract
was
entered
into
for
the
entire
group
of
films.
just
the
course
was
properly
held
we
believe
that
so
long
as
it
is
known
to
the
offeree
that
the
refusal
to
deal
on
less
than
a
group
is
temporary,
so
long
as
that
refusal
of
the
deal
was
not
disguised
as
conditioning,
so
long
as
it
is
done
in
good
faith,
it
is
a
proper
act.
as
justice
dawson
said,
a
contract
arising
from
the
desire
of
one
party
to
keep
the
films
away
from
his
competitor
does
not
constitute
a
block
booking
contract.
a
similar
case
occurred
in
connection
with
one
of
the
other
defendants
where
while
negotiating
with
two
stations
in
the
market,
one
station
requested
less
than
the
total
group
of
films.
the
other
station
requested
all
the
films
and
it
ultimately
entered
into
a
license
for
all
of
the
films.
the
government
would
have
this
court
say,
in
both
of
these
circumstances,
that
the
first
station
that
entered
into
negotiations
would
have
the
priority
to
determine,
to
pick
and
choose
among
the
films
and
the
group
that
they
may
wish,
and
incidentally
to
deprive
the
competitors
in
that
market
of
an
opportunity
to
deal
on
those
films.
the
government
does
say,
however,
that
if
this
position
does
not
prove
to
be
proper
and
the
action
turns
out
not
to
be
illegal,
they
like
to
have
such
action
enjoined
by
modification
of
the
lower
court
decree.
first,
i
want
to
say
that
the
government's
position
in
respect
to
this
point
has
shifted
since
the
time
of
the
lower
court
trial.
at
that
time,
the
senior
trial
counsel
indicated
to
judge
dawson
that
this
point
was
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
subsequently,
the
associate
trial
counsel
indicated
to
judge
dawson
that
a
distributor
need
not
sell
part
of
a
package
if
at
the
same
time
he
does
have
a
willing
customer
to
buy
all
of
the
packages.
notwithstanding,
the
position
taken
in
the
lower
court,
the
government
now
makes
this
an
important
point
in
its
appeal.
it's
interesting
to
note,
however,
that
when
challenged
by
the
various
briefs
of
the
defendants,
first
is
the
practicality
of
this
position,
and
second
as
to
the
validity
of
them,
the
government
has
shifted
again
and
now
says
that
they
don't
say
that
a
station
cannot
contact
--
a
distributor
cannot
contact
all
of
the
stations
in
the
market.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
say
that
a
distributor
may
solicit
indications,
solicit
indications
on
page
4,
government's
reply
brief,
as
to
the
number
of
films
for
the
station
may
desire
and
also
as
to
the
price
that
the
station
is
willing
to
pay.
now,
whatever
the
ambiguous
term
solicit
indications
means,
and
i
don't
think
that
this
defendant
should
be
put
at
the
risk
of
determining
it
for
themselves.
certainly,
there
is
very
little
difference
between
canvassing
a
market
and
soliciting
invitation
--
the
soliciting
indications.
it
would
appear
as
if
perhaps,
the
government
has
either
abandoned
its
position
or
has
recognized
that
in
any
effect
it
has
a
very
weak
position.
mr.
friedman
has
said
to
this
court
this
morning
that
there's
no
difference
between
temporary
dealings
of
the
type
that
i've
been
talking
about
and
a
permanent
restrain.
he
says
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
a
television
distributor
tells
a
station
that
it
will
not
break
a
group
temporarily
until
it
has
canvassed
the
market.
a
television
distributor
can
utilize
this
approach
in
every
case
in
which
it
decides
that
it
wishes
to
coerce
a
block
book
contract.
well,
obviously,
that's
not
true.
obviously,
judge
dawson
was
able
to
read
out
from
among
the
few
number
of
cases
that
he
found
who
have
been
coerced.
this
case
indicated
a
finding
of
good
faith
on
a
part
of
a
distributor,
the
matter
of
the
facts
under
which
the
distributor
works
are
easily
to
be
found
by
the
trial
court
and
has
been
found.
in
respect
to
the
request
by
the
government
further
modifications
of
the
decree,
there's
one
prevailing
vice
in
the
government's
position.
they
would
like
to
have
this
court
reviewed
this
matter.
it's
the
evidence
that
they
wish
they
were
able
to
prove
in
the
lower
court.
the
government
like
any
other
litigant
is
bound
by
its
failures
and
its
defaults
and
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
lower
court.
in
its
brief,
the
government
said
that
the
modifications
requested
by
it
are
justified
in
court,
because
of
the
practice
of
block
booking
engaged
in
by
the
defendants.
they
also
claimed
in
its
brief,
that
the
price
differential
amendment
which
is
requested
by
them
is
justified
by
the
findings
of
the
use
of
price
differentials
as
a
device
for
block
booking.
however,
in
its
reply
brief,
the
government
now
concedes
that
there
never
was
any
finding
of
fact
by
the
lower
court
either
as
to
any
policy
of
block
booking
or
as
to
the
use
of
price
differentials.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
judge
dawson
commented
the
conclusion
of
the
government's
case
that
the
government
had
put
in
no
evidence
whatsoever,
the
price
differentials
that
have
ever
been
used
in
connection
with
the
conditioning
or
coercion
of
block
book
contracts.
as
far
as
the
baltimore
station
is
concerned
which
have
been
cited
by
mr.
friedman,
i
must
make
it
clear
that
judge
dawson
did
not
find
that
there
was
a
price
differential
use
in
connection
with
the
contract
which
he
held
to
be
block
booked.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
considerable
testimony
in
the
record,
both
my
mr.
unger,
the
president
of
nta
and
others,
that
because
of
the
quality
of
the
films
involved,
the
particular
pricing
based
on
quality
of
the
films
was
not
out
of
bound
and
i
point
out
again,
judge
dawson
did
not
so
find
it.
as
far
as
the
question
of
price
differentials
are
concerned,
i
must
point
out
that
the
government
has
adopted
for
itself
an
arbitrary
standard
which
has
no
connection
whatsoever
with
business
usage.
you've
heard
that
the
stations
like
to
buy
both
pictures
and
they
like
to
pay
average
prices.
the
usual
negotiation
between
a
station
and
a
distributor
involves
a
negotiation
over
an
average
price.
the
station
comes
in
with
a
price
which
may
be
a
little
high
that
is
the
cost
of
the
negotiation.
the
distributor
in
the
station
then
negotiates
and
reaches
a
final
contract
price.
the
difference
between
the
original
offering
price
and
the
contract
price
is
not
as
the
government
would
have
you
believe,
based
either
upon
an
intention
to
block
book
or
savings
and
distribution
cost.
basically,
those
differences
first
come
from
a
negotiating
process.
in
addition,
you
may
have
a
discount
for
both
or
financial
pressures
may
cost
the
distributor
to
try
to
enter
into
contracts
quickly.
the
distributor
maybe
fearful
of
unknown
loses
if
he's
not
able
to
sell
his
pictures
at
that
time
because
of
new
pictures
coming
into
the
market.
all
number
of
reasons
is
involved.
i
think
that
the
government's
proposal
in
connection
with
the
modification
and
the
decree
has
been
thought
up
perhaps
properly
theoretically
but
it's
not
connected
with
the
government
as
a
business
usage.
in
closing,
i'd
like
to
request
that
this
court
deny
the
government's
motion
for
modification
of
the
judgment
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
judge
dawson
has
retained
jurisdiction
of
this
case
and
as
in
picayune
publishing
case
and
in
other
similar
cases
where
a
judge
has
retained
jurisdiction
any
future
of
abuses
can
be
left
to
its
informed
hindsight.
thank
you.
