mr.
louis
nizer
thank
you
sir.
may
it
please
the
chief
justice
and
the
court.
the
defendants,
both
as
appellants
and
respondents
have
divided
their
time
for
argument
so
that
one
of
my
colleagues
will
reply
to
the
government's
appeal
position
that
the
decree
should
be
enlarged
including
the
temporary
--
so-called
temporary
block
booking
provision.
another
of
my
colleagues
will
address
himself
to
the
proposition
that
there
were
a
minimal,
minuscule
number
of
alleged
violations
found
not
warranting
the
sweeping
injunction
decree
which
is
here
in
issue.
a
third
colleague
will
address
himself
to
the
unique
position
of
c
&
c
which
followed
a
practice
quite
different
and
which
it
sold
time
spots
rather
than
for
pictures
for
money.
and
i
will
limit
myself
to
the
proposition
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
was
no
basis
for
the
finding
of
an
illegal
tie-in
in
the
limited
number,
a
few
number
of
cases
which
the
district
court
found
to
exist
and
that
the
complaints
of
the
government
should
be
dismissed.
the
government
filed
six
separate
suits
against
six
distributors
of
motion
picture
films.
and
each
of
them,
it
conceded
that
there
was
no
issue
of
monopoly,
no
combination,
and
no
conspiracy.
these
six
suits
were
over
the
process
of
the
defendants
that
they
were
being
combined
although
their
practices
were
different
for
reasons
of
convenience
of
trial
consolidated
by
the
court
and
tried
together.
it
was
the
government's
claim
in
each
of
these
six
separate
actions
although
your
honors
should
observe
that
there
are
115
distributors
of
feature
films
to
television
which
is
a
new
industry
and
not
analogous
at
all
with
the
motion
picture
case,
paramount
case.
the
government
contended
at
all
times
that
100%
of
all
contracts
were
block
booked,
illegal
tie-ins.
contended
at
all
times
that
it
was
the
policy
of
each
company
to
tie-in
and
block
book
every
contract.
this
was
its
position
through
three
years
of
most
exhausting
and
exhausted
trial
procedures,
21,000
documents
were
called
from
the
files
of
the
television
stations
and
thousands
of
others
onto
the
ages
of
the
fbi
were
taken
from
our
files.
there
were
13
pretrial
conferences
with
the
court,
hundreds
of
pages
of
answers
to
interrogatories,
and
at
the
dates
of
the
trial
for
the
first
time,
the
government
withdrew
from
its
position
that
there
was
a
policy
to
block
book
or
that
every
contract
was
block
booked,
and
dozens
of
witnesses
who
had
been
subpoenaed
for
the
trial
were
interviewed
by
the
government
and
not
put
upon
stand,
and
other
witnesses
took
the
stand,
and
testified
about
matters
and
never
were
asked
about
the
very
contract
which
was
alleged
to
have
been
block
booked.
and
after
36
days
of
trial,
the
court
found
that
out
of
202
loew
contracts
in
total,
made
in
this
new
industry,
two
were
allegedly
illegal
for
tie-ins
by
subordinates
in
the
field.
out
of
221
aap
contracts,
four
were
illegal.
out
of
411
united
artists
contracts,
three
were
illegal.
and
out
of
1,500
screen
gems
contracts,
two
were
illegal.
and
this,
despite
the
advantage
which
the
government
had
and
that
these
television
station
executives
are
sensitive
to
government's
subpoena,
they're
under
the
issues
of
government
license
and
supervision
and
the
court
in
its
opinion
even
commented
upon
the
fact
that
these
witnesses
had
an
ulterior
motive
of
possibly
founding
a
trouble
damage
suit.
and
in
the
footnote,
the
court
said
that
one
witness
have
testified,
"if
there's
going
to
be
a
gravy
train,
i
want
to
get
on
it."
despite
all
these,
we
find,
the
government
now
took
into
mobile.
they
are
separate
cases
in
order
to
give
some
impact
of
the
number,
16
or
as
the
government
says
17,
i
think
that
was
inadvertent.
there
are
16
alleged
tie-in
cases
of
these
thousands
of
contracts
which
have
been
made.
now,
i
want
to
--
mr.
louis
nizer
they
reduced
the
number
after
all
of
these
pretrial
proceedings.
they
reduced
the
number
which
they
offered.
mr.
louis
nizer
and
at
that
we
think
that
it's
80
--
80
something
and
i
think
that
was
inadvertent
but
it
doesn't
matter.
under
the
authorities,
what
prerequisite
must
exist
for
the
finding
of
an
illegal
tie-in?
the
crucial
test
and
we
accept
those
authorities
as
sound
law,
we
do
not
quarrel
with
them,
a
very
beneficent
law.
the
crucial
test
is
whether
the
seller
has
the
dominance
in
the
market,
equivalent
to
sufficient
economic
power
to
coerce
the
buyer
into
taking
a
subdominant
product
and
thus
foreclosing
competition
for
the
subdominant
product.
it
is
a
very
evil
practice
and
that
it
delimits
competition
in
the
field.
but
this
prerequisite
among
others
but
particularly
this
one
that
there
must
be
a
demonstration
of
sufficient
economic
power
to
create
coercion
is
the
test
in
all
of
the
authorities
handed
down
by
this
court
and
indeed
the
government
in
its
complaint
in
this
action
defines
block
booking
as
compulsory
sale,
not
sale,
compulsory
sale.
now,
the
northern
pacific
case,
the
latest
authority
of
this
court,
the
majority
and
minority
agreed
that
this
was
the
test.
the
difference
of
opinion
was
simply
whether
the
evidence
in
that
case
showed
sufficient
economic
power
to
constitute
compulsive
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no
sir
and
in
the
cellophane
case
there
was
a
patented
article
and
it
doesn't
matter
as
i
shall
soon
attempt
to
demonstrate.
i
think
you
can
have,
mr.
justice
douglas,
you
can
have
and
according
to
our
humble
view,
you
can
have
economic
power
in
the
marketplace
without
a
copyrighted
article
and
you
can
have
none
with
a
copyrighted
or
patented
article
and
the
test
is
economic
power.
and
the
reason
that
the
block
booking
case
in
the
paramount
case
was
sound
was
that
there
the
copyrighted
articles
due
to
the
nature
of
that
industry
created
the
complete
economic
dominance
over
the
industry,
70%
of
the
suppliers
of
the
film
that
was
found
by
this
court.
eight
companies
controlling
78%
control
the
film.
and
that
film
constituted
100%
of
the
entertainment
in
those
theaters.
there
was
no
interchangeable
product.
and
the
life
of
that
theater
depended
upon
that
particular
motion
picture
and
by
combining
block
booking
with
blind
buying
in
that
industry,
not
applicable
at
all
to
this
as
i
shall
soon
demonstrate
by
the
practices
here.
by
combining
block
booking
in
which
50
odd
pictures
were
sold
before
they
were
made,
before
anyone
knew
who
the
stars
would
be
in
them
with
blind
buying
so
that
the
exhibitor,
the
theatre
owner
had
to
buy
them
before
he
could
look
at
them.
they
were
arrested
from
the
theater
operator
the
power
over
his
own
theater
and
there
was
clear
dominance
and
the
block
booking
decision
in
that
case
was
therefore
sound.
mr.
louis
nizer
the
early
ones
like
the
ibm
case
was
the
classic
case.
a
machine
--
mr.
louis
nizer
or
the
salt.
there
is
not
a
patent
to
that.
mr.
louis
nizer
plus
one
other
ingredient,
your
honor.
yes
but
plus
one
other
ingredient
that
that
patented
article
in
that
case
gave
dominance,
economic
power
in
the
market
to
compel
them
and
to
buy
ordinary
salt
which
he
could
have
gotten
from
any
other
competitor.
or
as
mr.
justice
black
said
in
the
northern
pacific
case,
if
you
tie-in
flour
and
sugar,
there
is
no
evil
because
there
is
an
open
competitive
market
for
either
product.
and
even
though
there
is
a
patented
article
as
in
the
cellophane
case,
if
there
are
competitive,
flexible
wrappings,
this
court
has
held
that
there
isn't
such
an
economic
power
in
the
market
as
to
constitute
the
coercion
which
is
the
evil
in
forcing
a
man
to
buy
that
which
he
doesn't
want
to
buy
it.
all
of
which
is
lacking
in
this
case
and
may
i
cut
right
through
and
say
to
your
honors
that
the
remarkable
fact
about
this
case
is
that
the
district
court
found
there
was
no
dominance
of
these
defendants
of
motion
picture
film
sales
to
the
distributors.
he
found
the
crucial
test
in
our
favor.
now,
how
then
if
the
crucial
test
was
found
in
our
favor,
how
do
we
go
about
finding
these
few
miniscule
number
of
violations?
he
did
so
because
he
deemed
himself
compelled
by
the
block
booking
paramount
case
to
say
that
the
very
copyright
of
a
motion
picture
creates
its
own
dominance.
and
the
error,
we
submit,
in
that
reasoning
is
that
the
test
is
not
the
dominance
over
the
article
or
indeed
you
don't
need
a
copyright.
everyone
has
a
complete
exclusive
ownership
over
any
product
he
makes.
the
test
is
the
dominance
or
sufficient
economic
power
over
the
market
in
which
that
article
competes
with
other
articles
for
it
is
that
power
over
the
market
which
makes
it
possible
to
tie-in
to
compel
the
buyer
to
give
up
his
independent
judgment
and
buy
a
product
he
doesn't
want
to
buy.
otherwise,
the
seller
is
merely
improvident
in
his
own
strategy.
he
puts
down
demands
because
the
price
is
too
great.
the
buyer
defies
him
and
goes
to
his
competitor.
he
destroys
himself
by
making
it
unreasonable
demand
whether
it'd
be
a
tie-in
demand
and
limitation
of
territory,
a
tie-in
provision
in
the
license.
he
must
meet
the
market
conditions
or
he
loses
out.
and
it
is
only
when
he
has
the
economic
dominance
over
the
market,
not
over
the
product,
that
he
has
the
power
to
do
that
which
is
illegal.
in
other
words,
a
benign
tie-in
becomes
evil
when
it
is
combined
with
the
economic
dominance
or
sufficient
economic
power
to
control
the
market
and
thus
create
the
coercion
which
is
the
base
of
the
evil.
now,
the
authorities
clearly
hold
that
to
be
the
case.
in
the
northern
pacific
case
this
court
and
referring
to
the
patent
made
this
pertinent
observation.
the
defendant
attempts
to
evade
the
force
of
international
salt
on
the
ground
that
the
tying
product
there
was
patented,
while
here
it
is
not,
that's
in
the
northern
pacific.
but
we
do
not
believe
this
distinction
has
or
should
have
any
significance.
and
arriving
in
its
decision
in
international
salt,
the
court
placed
no
reliance
on
the
fact
that
a
patent
was
involved,
nor
that
it
give
the
slightest
intimation
that
the
custom
of
the
outcome
would
have
been
any
different
if
it
had
--
if
it
had
not
been
the
case.
and
so
in
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
possibly
sir,
but
nevertheless,
there
was
the
decision.
and
i
think
the
decision
is
sound
in
this
sense,
your
honor.
that
unless
we
adopt
the
test
which
this
court
has
adopted
although
it
may
have
differed
in
various
cases
as
to
whether
that
economic
power
was
sufficiently
demonstrated.
but
unless
we
adopt
the
test
that
it
is
that
economic
dominance
which
translates
this
arrangement
into
a
transgression
of
law,
then
we
interfere
with
every
bargaining
enterprise
and
indeed
interfere
with
competition
rather
than
support
the
free
competitive
enterprise.
in
the
times-picayune
case
in
view
of
mr.
justice
white's
observation,
there,
mr.
justice
clark
in
his
opinion
held
that
because
the
product
was
the
same,
namely
advertising
into
theatres,
there
was
missing
that
the
other
ingredient,
a
different
product.
in
other
words,
the
subdominant
product
wasn't
available
and
consequently
the
court
there
said
that
this
is
not
an
illegal
tie-in
even
though
that
was
obviously
in
two
newspapers
out
of
three,
a
tie-in
that
you
had
to
advertise
in
the
morning
and
evening
papers.
similarly,
in
this
case,
these
motion
pictures
though
copyrighted
our
interpretation
with
what
the
evidence
showed
9,000
to
10,000
other
copyrighted
films
available
in
the
market.
we
would
distribute
groups
of
30,
58,
and
100
in
the
early
days
of
full
library
of
712.
that
was
the
largest.
but
there
were
8,000
to
9,000
films
competing
with
those
films
all
copyrighted.
and
if
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
mere
copyright
artificially
substitutes
for
the
economic
power
missing
in
the
marketplace
as
this
court
found.
he
substituted
an
artificial
concept
of
copyright
for
the
reality
that
there
was
no
economic
dominance
in
the
market.
if
we
come
to
that
conclusion,
then
you
reached
the
absurdity
that
every
article
is
a
monopoly
of
itself.
every
owner
has
control
of
his
own
product
and
consequently
no
product
can
be
sold
in
connection
with
any
other
product
even
the
same
or
different.
and
incidentally,
that
absurdity
was
reached
in
a
case
in
which
the
governmet
asked
this
court
to
send
back
the
appeal
to
the
district
court
and
dismiss
it.
it
was
the
guerlain
case,
a
perfume
case.
there,
the
district
court
led
by
--
lured
by
this
argument
held
that
since
guerlain
was
a
unique
perfume
for
itself,
although
it
was
in
competition
with
others,
that
it
constituted
a
monopoly
over
itself.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
the
government
asked
that
this
court
remanded
to
the
district
court
and
asked
the
district
court
to
dismiss
that
judgment,
because
you
reached
that
absurdity
that
any
ownership
over
your
own
product
constitutes
a
monopoly
of
that
product
which
isn't
the
monopoly
we
talked
about
in
order
to
protect
ourselves
under
the
sherman
act.
and
may
i
also
point
out
that
this
action
is
brought
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
and
not
section
3
of
the
clayton
act.
and
the
distinction
is
that
under
section
1,
the
tie-in
arrangement
must
be
unreasonable
as
a
restraint
and
there's
a
greater
burden
upon
the
government.
and
there
is
no
unreasonableness
here.
the
marketplace
was
free
to
all.
the
government
--
mr.
louis
nizer
the
product,
not
each
film
because
of
its
copyright,
but
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no,
no.
these
were
all
between
12
and
30
years
old
while
there
is
a
distinction
between
some
films
and
others
in
entertainment
value,
their
uniqueness,
if
it
be
deemed
artistic,
was
never
translated
into
economic
uniqueness
which
i
refer
to
again
as
the
crucial
test.
mr.
louis
nizer
in
substance
they
were.
it
is
difficult
to
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes
there
was.
i
know
that
there
are
certain
even
old
films
which
are
better
than
some
cheap
western
that
was
made
30
years
ago.
mr.
louis
nizer
no.
no
may
i
indicate
that
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
quite
wrong.
i
was
going
to
demonstrate
it
from
the
record
and
will.
mr.
louis
nizer
i
assert
the
law.
i
accept
the
finding
and
the
few
cases
the
government
--
the
court
made
them
because
we
think
they
are
so
minuscule,
it
isn't
worth
reopening
the
record
for
those
few
instances.
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
court
did
so
solely
on
the
basis
that
the
copyright
made
it
so
distinctive
in
itself
that
the
artistic
uniqueness
of
the
film
as
the
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
louis
nizer
no
factually,
he
filed
a
notion
in
those
two
cases.
your
honor
is
quite
right
that
there
was
tie-in
and
therefore
they
weren't
--
mr.
louis
nizer
yes,
i
think
that
i
should
explain
the
difference
in
this
industry
which
is
not
analogous
at
all
to
the
motion
picture
industry
and
there
is
always
the
semantic
danger
that
because
motion
pictures
are
referred
to
that
the
two
are
deemed
to
be
acquainted.
in
television,
the
practice
is
to
sell
advertising
time.
you
do
not
buy
the
picture.
you
buy
time.
the
advertiser
does.
and
that
time
is
determined
by
card
rates.
and
the
rate
is
the
same
no
matter
what
program
is
put
on
that
segment
of
time.
and
the
rate
difference
--
differs
in
accordance
with
the
hour
at
which
the
time
is
taken
incidentally.
these
old
motion
pictures
overplayed
in
fringe
time
as
it
is
called
in
television
parlance,
late
shows,
late,
late
shows,
and
late,
late,
late
shows
and
the
early
hours
of
the
morning.
mr.
louis
nizer
and
the
--
and
the
reason
that
they
were
shown
in
fringe
time
was
in
order
to
get
cheaper
rates,
the
television
companies
didn't
want
to
pay
for
real
motion
pictures
that
were
current
and
more
important
or
even
the
old
ones.
that's
why
they
sample
these
packages
and
made
averages
out
of
them.
but
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
there
is
no
analogy
between
the
paramount
case
and
this
case,
this
is
another
industry.
here,
the
motion
picture
is
given
free.
the
man
who
buys
the
spot
time
doesn't
know
what
motion
picture
is
going
to
be
shown.
he
buys
that
segment
of
time
and
pays
according
to
a
rate
that's
fixed
by
that
station.
consequently,
instead
of
being
the
lifeblood
of
the
theater
as
the
motion
picture
is
in
that
theatre
in
which
the
box
office
results
are
determined
by
the
attractiveness
of
that
picture.in
television,
the
time
is
uniform
irrespective
of
whether
a
better
picture
or
a
worst
picture
or
a
worst
picture
is
shown
or
indeed
no
picture
is
shown
but
something
else
is
shown.
and
it
should
be
observe
that
the
court
--
mr.
louis
nizer
no
sir,
what
i'm
arguing,
your
honor,
is
this.
and
the
evidence
overwhelmingly
shows
this.
there
was
no
tie-in.
the
kind
of
argument
that
went
on
was
price.
since
the
station
have
to
fill
--
had
to
fill
in
this
time
and
could
only
get
a
standard
rate
no
matter
what
kind
of
a
picture
it
shows,
it
wanted
the
best
pictures
obviously
in
order
to
have
larger
attractiveness
for
its
station.
but
its
income
did
not
depend
upon
how
that
picture
did
consequently
in
order
to
bring
down
the
price
to
be
within
its
economic
range
particularly
for
fringe
time,
the
kind
of
argument
which
has
been
translated
by
the
government
into
forcing
which
took
place
normally
in
the
marketplace
was
this.
how
much
is
the
average
price?
i
need
120
pictures.
incidentally,
they
always
wanted
quantities.
i
need
500
pictures.
what's
your
average
price
for
this
package
and
suppose
they
fixed
$100
as
average
price.
now,
will
you
drop
out
10
of
these
very
bad
ones
down
here
and
give
me
five
better
ones
for.
that
was
the
argument.
the
evidence
never
revealed
a
tie-in
in
the
sense
that
one
has
it
in
the
northern
pacific
or
in
any
of
the
other
classic
ibm
cases.
and
since
the
government
referred
to
one
case
which
it
deemed
horrendous
and
quoted
the
evidence,
let
me
illustrate
that
because
i
think
it
dramatically
points
out
what
the
record
really
shows.
in
the
very
case
that
government
counsel
indicated
show
tie-in.
at
record
904,
the
following
--
the
court
asked
the
following
question,
"what
else
did
you
say?"
did
you
try
to
persuade
him
to
offer
it
on
a
different
basis
or
something
like
that?
the
witness,
"i
simply
told
him
that
the
price
is
out
of
line
for
our
market."
mr.
gresham,
"and
on
that
basis,
we
are
just
not
interested."
a
little
later,
the
same
witness
that
he
referred
to.
question
-
"and
you
were
interested
on
the
very
sizable
quantity
of
pictures
at
that
time
weren't
you?"
answer
-
"well,
we
were
interested
on
the
library
of
films,
yes."
question
-
"and
this
library
wasn't
too
large
if
the
price
was
right,
is
that
correct?"
no,
i
would
say
we
were
interested
on
the
library
at
913.
answer
-
"i
offered
him
as
i
recall
it
$425
for
film
and
that
figures
up
around
$300,000."
incidentally
loews'
had
asked
for
a
million
and
you
just
turned
them
away.
this
was
a
biased
market.
this
very
witness
testified
he
kept
all
the
other
companies
cooling
their
heels
as
he
put
it
outside
in
his
office.
and
i
said,
morey,
you
can
take
it
or
leave
it
$300,000.
question
-
"right
and
he
took
it?"
answer
-
"and
he
took
it."
question
-
"and
this
was
the
only
proposal,
the
only
offer
you
ever
made
to
loew's
for
the
library
in
concrete
terms
i
mean."
answer
-
"yes,
sir."
final
question,
this
is
the
tie-in
case
the
government
found.
and
he
hadn't
used
any
oppressive
tactics
on
you
in
this
sale
of
any
kind.
he
used
persuasion
as
a
salesman.
is
that
right?
that's
right.
question
-
"and
you
felt
you're
under
no
economic,
moral,
or
any
other
physical
force
to
do
what
you
did."
what
you
did
was
of
your
own
free
will
thinking
that
you
have
the
best
deal
you
could
make
fairly,
is
that
right?
answer
-
"we
were
satisfied
with
the
deal."
question
-
"the
answer
to
my
question
is
yes."
answer
-
"yes."
this
is
the
best
illustration
they
have
of
what
they
call
coercive
buying.
it
was
simply
an
argument
of
price,
the
tug
and
pull
in
the
marketplace
to
obtain
a
better
deal.
the
cellophane
case,
coming
back
to
mr.
justice
douglas'
observation
about
patent
because
since
the
lower
court
did
based
its
entire
judgment
upon
the
fact
that
it
was
deemed,
it
deemed
itself
under
the
features
of
that
paramount
case
to
be
obliged
to
find
dominance
in
the
market
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
no
actual
economic
marketplace.
we
have
found
that
the
--
in
the
announces
of
these
cases
that
whether
there
is
a
copyright
or
not,
whether
there
is
a
patent
or
not,
the
only
test
is,
does
that
copyright
or
patent
or
without
it
give
the
seller
the
dominance
in
the
market
sufficient
to
create
the
coercion
of
tie-in.
that
is
what
is
illegal
and
it
certainly
doesn't
exist
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
nizer
may
it
please
your
honor.
a
reference
to
the
decree
two
or
three
weeks
ago,
the
government
entered
into
a
consent
decree
with
mca,
one
of
the
largest
according
to
its
complaint
in
that
action,
the
largest
distributor
of
motion
picture
films
for
television.
and
in
that
consent
decree,
they
did
not
ask
for
any
of
the
items
of
relief
which
they
insist
are
essential
here.
and
if
that
relief
were
to
be
granted
in
the
event,
this
complaint
is
upheld,
we
would
be
at
the
disadvantage
with
respect
to
the
largest
competitor
who
did
not
have
the
restrictions
upon
them
by
virtue
of
the
government's
consent
in
that
case
that
those
requirements
were
not
necessary.
secondly,
recent
mca's
consent
decree
only
two
weeks
ago.
secondly,
the
market
in
this
case
which
the
court
below
found,
we
did
not
dominate
or
have
the
economic
power
was
the
distribution
of
motion
picture
film
to
television.
but
actually,
as
the
court
further
found,
that
is
not
the
relevant
market.
the
relevant
market
is
much
wider
even
on
that
manner
of
restricted
basis,
we
didn't
have
economic
power.
actually,
the
market
is
not
the
supply
of
motion
pictures,
feature
films
to
television,
but
the
entire
programming
because
all
the
evidence,
there
was
no
contradiction
is
that
these
are
interchangeable
vertically
in
one
particular
station
depending
on
the
segment
of
time
you
can
have
a
taped
show,
a
special
motion
picture
film
made
for
television,
a
cinemascope
or
a
live
program,
or
a
motion
picture.
horizontally,
if
you
flip
the
dials,
you
will
find
a
motion
picture
in
competition
with
the
live
show
or
a
quiz
show
so
that
the
programming
is
interchangeable,
which
is
one
of
the
tests
in
the
tie-in
cases,
and
their
relevant
market,
therefore,
is
the
entire
programming
of
motion
picture
--
of
entertainment
on
television.
and
the
record
shows
that
for
many
years,
there
were
no
motion
picture
films.
indeed,
when
your
honor
asked
whether
there'd
been
a
similar
case,
there
was
a
case
in
which
the
government
brought
suit
in
california
to
compel
the
motion
picture
companies
to
make
their
films
available
to
television
stations.
they
said
these
are
our
competitors.
we
don't
want
to
supply
them
now
because
of
economic
necessity,
we
do
supply
them.
there
is
another
complaint
that
we're
supplying
them
too
much.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
market
involved
is
the
entire
programming
of
which
we
have
3%
to
8%
according
to
the
uncontradicted
testimony
and
each
defendant
has
a
fraction
of
less
than
a
half
percent
of
that
market,
therefore,
the
complete
absence
of
the
requirement
of
dominance.
and
one
quotation
from
the
cellophane
case
in
view
of
the
question
as
to
whether
patent
of
copyrights
applies
the
practical
control.
"the
power
of
that
automobile
or
softdrink
manufacturers
have
over
their
trademark
products
is
not
the
power
that
makes
an
illegal
monopoly.
illegal
power
must
be
appraised
in
terms
of
a
competitive
market
for
the
product.
and
by
that
test,
the
competitive
market,
there
were
1,500
of
the
distributors
of
9,000
to
10,000
films
as
against
the
few
hundred
we
were
distributing."
