mr.
myles
j.
lane
mr.
chief
justice,
i
shall
address
my
argument
to
point
two
of
appeal
number
43
which
just
headed
the
injunctive
relief
is
not
warranted.
i
want
to
make
it
clear
at
the
outset
that
these
are
four
separate
independent
cases
that
have
only
one
thing
in
common,
and
that
is
there
was
intense
competition
among
each
of
the
four
appellants
in
this
particular
case.
i
heard
counsel
for
the
government
say
that
there
was
substantial
number
of
violations.
well,
i
want
to
remind
that
counsel
that
as
far
as
screen
gems
was
concerned,
there
were
two
violations
covering
a
period
of
four
years.
and
the
two
violations
will
be
at
one
station
and
were
made
the
contracts
involved
that
were
entered
into
10
months
and
seven
months
before
the
government
started
the
suit
in
1957.
in
other
words,
from
september
1956
up-to-date
although
screen
gems
had
entered
into
1,500
contracts,
the
government
was
unable
to
find
one
single
violation.
i
doubt
very
much
whether
anybody
can
consider
that
substantial.
with
respect
to
loew's
as
mr.
nizer
has
pointed
out,
the
government
found
two
violations,
three
violations
to
the
united
artists,
and
four
for
associated
artists.
the
total
amount
of
the
contracts
entered
into
by
screen
gems
was
not
up
in
$3
million
or
$4
million
i
heard
here
today.
the
total
amount
of
the
screen
gems
contracts
are
$60,800
and
that
amount
involving
78
pictures,
i
think
the
record
will
show
that
the
stations
did
not
want
probably
four
or
five
pictures
so
the
total
amount
of
money
involved
as
far
as
screen
gems
was
concerned
was
about
$5,000
to
$6,000.
i
think
the
question
presented
here,
your
honors,
is
whether
the
district
court
molded
its
decree
to
fit
the
necessities
of
this
particular
case
of
whether
it
neglected
the
admonition
of
this
court
and
also
the
market
that
was
involved,
and
the
number,
and
the
types
of
cases.
as
mr.
nizer
pointed
out,
the
market
here
was
not
motion
pictures.
the
market
here
is
television
programming
of
which
motions
--
motion
pictures
constitute
about
7%
of
the
entire
market.
this
court
not
so
long
ago,
enunciated
four
factors
which
a
district
court
must
consider
in
determining
whether
the
moving
party,
in
this
case
the
government,
whether
it
has
met
its
burden
of
demonstrating
the
need
for
injunctive
relief.
and
those
four
tests
as
i
quoted
are
first,
the
character
of
the
past
violations;
second,
the
bona
fides
of
the
party's
intent
to
comply
with
the
law;
third,
the
discontinuance
of
the
violations,
and
the
effectiveness
of
this
discontinuance;
and
fourth,
the
danger
of
a
recurrence
of
violations.
and
using
these
measures
against
the
situation
presented
by
the
various
appeals
in
this
case,
i
shall
argue
that
injunction
should
not
have
been
granted.
with
respect
to
the
first
test,
the
question
of
the
type
of
character
of
past
violations,
the
government
has
found
as
i
have
already
pointed
out
that
screen
gems
had
two
contracts
that
were
held
violated
out
of
1,500.
the
particular
type
of
violation
was
not
the
kind
which
this
court
has
enjoined
before.
the
lower
court
found
there
was
no
competition.
there
was
no
--
rather
intense
competition
between
all
of
the
defendants
in
the
case
below.
it
found
out
that
as
between
the
distributors
of
old
motion
pictures
and
the
other
type
of
program
and
those
are
live
shows,
taped
shows,
and
so
forth.
there
was
also
intense
competition.
and
it
also
found
that
there
was
nothing
here
of
an
antitrust
violation
which
stifle
the
programming
market.
so
that
with
respect
to
that
particular
test,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
not
the
type
which
this
court
has
found
upon
in
the
past.
the
second
factor
or
test
where
the
intent
of
the
appellants
to
comply
with
the
law,
now
the
record
is
clear
both
to
documentary,
proof
and
through
the
testimony
of
witnesses
at
the
trial
that
screen
gems
had
a
policy
of
selectivity
which
was
put
into
effect
in
march
of
1956.
it
was
a
testimony
by
the
former
vice
president
of
screen
gems.
there
was
a
testimony
by
the
various
salesmen
to
this
effect.
and
insofar
as
loew's
was
concerned
as
government
counsel
pointed
out,
loew's
in
1957
put
an
advertisement
in
trade
papers
about
their
selective
policy.
and
i
believe
as
far
as
united
artists
were
concerned,
they
sent
telegrams
in
1957.
but
screen
gems
had
its
policy
through
1956
on.
it
was
a
written
policy.
it's
in
the
record.
it
was
effectuated
throughout
that
period.
and
as
i
say,
the
best
indication
of
good
faith
on
the
part
of
screen
gems
and
the
other
appellants
to
comply.
in
addition
to
that,
the
record
is
replete
with
instance
after
instance
where
these
contracts
that
were
put
in
evidence
by
the
government
in
an
attempt
to
show
that
there
was
no
selectivity.
if
your
honors
will
look
at
the
record,
you
will
see
that
all
of
these
contracts
were
contracts
where
the
station
was
given
selectivity.
the
third
criteria
were
the
effectiveness
of
the
discontinuance
by
the
appellants.
this
was
another
test
which
the
government
failed
to
meet
in
the
court
below
to
show
a
continuance
to
the
violations
involved.
for
example,
the
record
is
barren
of
a
single
instance,
not
once
in
september
of
1956
of
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
screen
gems
to
block
book.
and
i
maintain
that
with
all
the
powers
of
the
government
with
the
fbi
going
out
and
interviewing
all
of
these
stations
and
going
through
all
of
our
records,
the
inability
of
the
government
to
find
one
single
instance
since
1956,
a
period
in
which
screen
gems
entered
into
1,500
contracts
as
best
evidence
that
there
--
of
the
intent
of
screen
gems
to
give
up
any
violations
that
they
have.
if
there
weren't
any
violations
in
1956,
i
maintain
that
there
is
no
need
of
an
injunction
at
this
period.
what
will
the
injunction
stop
if
the
violation
has
ceased
for
the
last
four
or
five,
or
six
years
and
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
there
was
any
continuance
after
that
day.
the
last
and
final
test
which
the
government
has
been
unable
to
show
was
this
danger
as
i
point
out
of
recurrent
violation.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
which
indicates
the
possibility
of
any
recurrence
is
the
testimony
of
the
government's
key
witness.
and
i'd
like
to
devote
a
couple
of
minutes
to
that
because
i
think
it's
most
persuasive.
the
government
called
to
stand
a
man
by
the
name
of
robert
weisberg.
weisberg
was
the
buyer
for
an
outfit
known
as
tv
television
stations,
inc.
and
as
he
testified,
he
bought
for
110
stations
which
constitute
20%
of
all
the
television
stations
in
the
united
states.
now,
obviously,
the
government
put
this
man
on
the
stand
for
one
reason.
to
show
that
there
was
a
cognizable
danger
of
recurrent
violation.
as
i
say,
this
man
was
the
equivalent
of
putting
110
station
witnesses
on
the
stand.
now,
what
did
he
testify
to?
instead
of
testifying
as
the
government
hoped
he
would,
he
testified
just
the
opposite.
and
perhaps
this
is
the
reason
why
the
government
has
been
unable
to
approve
more
than
two
instances
of
violation
against
my
client
and
two
or
three
against
the
other
appellants
in
this
case.
he
testified
that
each
year,
he
entered
into
5,000
or
6,000
negotiations
for
these
various
stations.
and
amazingly
enough,
he
said
that
in
all
his
experience,
that
98%
of
those
negotiations,
the
parties
involved
wanted
selectivity,
no.
they
wanted
to
buy
in
bulk
in
only
two
instances
or
2%
rather
of
all
the
cases,
did
they
want
selectivity
which
gives
the
court
a
pretty
good
idea,
number
one,
of
the
type
--
let's
stop
here
i
guess.
mr.
myles
j.
lane
well,
it
gives
the
court
a
fairly
good
idea
of
what
the
policies
in
the
market
were
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
the
stations
wanted
bulk.
they
didn't
want
selectivity.
for
their
own
economic
reasons,
they
wanted
that.
and
i
say,
your
honors,
in
conclusion
that
the
function
of
a
court
of
equity
is
not
to
punish
past
violations
but
to
prevent
future
violations.
and
i
think
as
i've
demonstrated
here,
the
court
below
did
not
meet
anyone
of
the
four
standards
set
up
by
this
court
in
the
grant
case.
and
therefore,
i
submit
your
honor
that
on
the
basis
of
these
that
the
district
court
had
used
its
discretion
in
posing
injunctive
relief
and
i
respectfully
request
the
decision
of
the
district
court
with
respect
to
these
four
appellants
be
reversed.
