one
of
your
errors
to
change
a
firm
to
reverse.
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
argument
was
back
to
the
old
tie-in
clause
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
these
were
not
copyrighted,
that
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
the
result
would
be
different.
justice
william
o.
douglas
when
you
get
back
to
the
colgate
case
that
type
of
thing.
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
case
it
didn't
have
a
copyright,
you'd
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
had
there
been
any
triple
--
trouble
damage
suits
in
this
field
touching
block
booking
by
television?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
it
would
be
alright
if
they
offered
10
--
if
you
take
10,
you'll
get
10%
discount,
something
like
that.
that
would
be
alright.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course,
that
was
--
there
were
no
copyright
of
patented
material.
justice
william
o.
douglas
of
course
the
earlier
tying
agreements
went
off
on
a
different
theory
though,
didn't
they?

international
salt.
justice
william
o.
douglas
all
you
have
is
a
patent
and
you
may
not
have
any
part
of
the
market
but
if
you
start
tying
things
to
the
patent
then
you
enlarge
by
your
agreement
the
things
you
can
only
get
through
a
patent.
that
was
the
theory,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
would
have
surprised
justice
jackson,
don't
you
think?
