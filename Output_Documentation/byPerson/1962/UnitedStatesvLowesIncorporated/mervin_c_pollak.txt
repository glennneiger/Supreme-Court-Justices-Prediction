mr.
mervin
c.
pollak
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
represent
the
maverick
among
these
appellants.
the
one
company
whose
television
licensing
practices
were
different
from
the
others
and
they
were
different
because
of
the
circumstances
under
which
this
company
acquired
its
television
rights.
there
isn't
time
to
go
into
the
details
of
the
tried
body
negotiations
which
led
to
them.
counsel
for
the
government
had
summarized
the
result.
this
company
instead
of
receiving
unlimited
rights
to
license
the
rko
films,
television
stations,
received
the
right
to
license
those
films
only
in
accordance
with
the
terms
of
a
very
restrictive
contract
with
international
latex
which
was
entered
into
for
a
very
sound
business
reasons
on
the
part
of
latex
and
for
the
reason
on
the
part
of
c
&
c
that
it
couldn't
get
the
rko
financing
in
any
other
way.
and
that
result
was
that
the
rko
pictures
could
be
licensed
to
television
stations
only
if
those
stations
would
make
available
to
c
&
c
for
transfer
to
latex,
a
large
number
of
television
spots
to
advertise
its
product.
the
large
number
was
needed
for
a
very
sound
business
reasons
and
c
&
c
had
no
choice
but
to
comply
with
that.
if
it
made
any
contracts
which
did
not
produce
minimum
numbers
of
spots,
it
could
not
be
paid.
and
in
that
effect
of
this
minimum
spot
demand
in
each
case
on
the
part
of
a
station
was
the
natural
conclusion
that
as
long
as
they
had
to
give
away
these
many
spots,
they
would
take
all
of
the
pictures
that
they
could
get
for
that
many
spots.
now,
the
district
court
observing
the
practice
of
television
stations
and
c
&
c
under
these
arrangements,
came
to
the
conclusion,
one,
that
c
&
c
never
went
to
a
particular
television
station
and
said,
"in
order
to
take
--
in
order
to
get
this
rko
picture,
you
must
take
that
one.
or
in
order
to
get
some
rko
pictures,
you
must
take
others
or
all
of
our
rko
pictures."
that
is
what
the
complaint
defined
as
block
booking.
it's
what
this
court
has
defined
as
block
booking
and
mr.
friedman
described
as
block
booking.
the
court
found
instead
that
c
&
c
conditioned
every
sale
on
a
minimum
price,
a
minimum
price
expressed
in
terms
of
spots.
then
c
&
c
said,
this
resulted
in
sales
of
groups
--
i
mean
the
court
said,
this
resulted
in
sales
of
groups
of
films,
therefore,
it
was
block
booking
and
c
&
c
operated
under
a
policy
of
block
booking.
now,
it
seems
to
me
respectfully
that
this
is
error.
it's
an
error
based
on
a
full
syllogism
which
runs
something
like
this.
every
time
there
is
a
block
book
contract,
the
result
is
a
sale
or
a
license
of
a
group
of
films.
every
time
c
&
c
made
a
spot
minimum
demand
on
this
television
station,
the
result
was
a
license
for
a
group
of
films.
therefore,
c
&
c's
minimum
price
demand
equals
block
booking.
this
doesn't
necessarily
follow
and
we
feel
that
the
legality
of
c
&
c's
minimum
spot
demand
must
be
determined
not
by
the
result
of
that
policy
but
by
the
purpose
and
the
character
of
the
conduct
that
led
up
to
it.
now,
mr.
friedman
said,
"nobody
in
this
case
challenges
the
government's
finding
that
it
entered
into
block
booking
contracts".
c
&
c
does
challenge
that.
and
the
first
point
we
make
is
that
the
activities
of
c
&
c
in
demanding
minimum
numbers
of
spots
was
not
block
booking.
we
claim
it
is
not
block
booking,
first,
because
it
was
not
entered
into
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
television
station
to
take
more
than
one
or
several
pictures.
it
was
entered
into
for
the
collateral
and
simple
business
reason
that
this
was
the
only
way
in
which
c
&
c
could
get
income
from
its
licensing
activities.
secondly,
in
the
nature
of
the
c
&
c
contracts
with
television
stations,
it's
very
clear
that
these
stations
bought
not
specific
pictures
but
a
bundle
of
pictures.
for
one
thing,
every
c
&
c
license
contained
what
they
call
the
cushion
clause.
c
&
c
was
permitted
under
every
contract
to
deliver
7%
to
10%
less
pictures
than
the
contract
call
for.
there
were
technical
reasons
why
this
was
necessary.
and
any
station
contracting
to
license
742
pictures
from
c
&
c
would
have
its
contract
fulfilled
of
c
&
c,
gave
them
only
720
pictures.
and
there
is
no
way
of
telling
which
720
c
&
c
would
give
them.
likewise,
c
&
c
had
an
escape
clause.
if
it
couldn't
give
a
particular
license
picture
to
a
station,
it
had
the
right
to
give
a
different
picture
of
comparable
quality
without
specifying
what
the
title
of
that
comparable
quality
should
be.
and
so
it's
apparent
that
when
the
television
stations
bought
from
c
&
c,
they
were
never
sure
exactly
which
titles
they
were
going
to
get.
secondly,
when
the
c
&
c
contracts
went
into
effect,
every
station
got
unlimited
runs
of
all
the
pictures
for
10
years.
and
so,
it
didn't
matter
to
a
television
station
if
out
of
742
pictures,
it
did
happen
to
get
two
spanish
titled
pictures
which
were
in
the
bundle.
c
&
c
just
gave
them
everything
it
had,
but
it
wasn't
the
kind
of
licensing
that
took
place
with
respect
to
the
others.
now,
we
claim
that
in
this
situation,
there
is
no
compulsion
on
the
part
of
the
stations
to
buy
from
c
&
c.
this
court
held
in
united
states
against
bethlehem
steel
that
economic
compulsion
or
the
rest
would
only
be
present
when
two
circumstances
occurred,
one,
when
there
was
overpowering
strength
on
one
side
and
feebleness
on
the
other,
and
two,
when
the
yielding
party
had
no
adequate
alternative.
in
this
case,
the
record
shows
clearly
that
the
television
stations
had
the
bargaining
strength
and
the
distributors
were
in
competition
with
the
host
of
other
suppliers,
and
secondly,
that
there
were
many
alternatives
if
a
station
didn't
like
the
terms
on
which
c
&
c
offered
its
pictures.
they
could
go
to
other
suppliers
and
suppliers
of
other
programs.
in
these
circumstances,
yielding
to
bargaining
pressure
was
merely
yielding
a
preference
and
not
a
non-volitional
act.
the
whole
business
world,
every
contract
has
that
kind
of
compromise.
our
second
point
is
that
there
is
a
growing
recognition
in
the
courts
below
of
a
doctrine
of
business
justification
where
tying
is
concerned.
when
the
object
and
the
purpose
of
tying
is
something
entirely
extraneous
to
the
simple
benefit
or
direct
benefit
of
getting
a
larger
share
of
the
market
by
the
leverage
of
a
tie-in
device,
the
courts
look
to
see
whether
it
was
reasonable.
that
happened
in
dehydrating
process
against
smith
where
there
was
a
valid
reason
why
smith
company
would
only
sell
its
unloading
device
in
connection
with
its
own
silos.
the
first
circuit
made
a
very
clear
opinion
of
the
principles
behind
this
point
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
the
same
thing
took
place
in
united
states
against
general
electric
in
court.
the
district
court
which
upheld
as
an
initial
practice
the
right
of
a
new
community
and
10
assistant
companies
to
sell
its
component
parts
only
in
terms
of
systems
and
in
connection
with
the
service
contract.
when
the
need
for
that
kind
of
sale
disappeared,
the
tie-in
became
illegal.
c
&
c
had
a
very
valid
business
reason
for
insisting
on
minimum
spots.
it
was
the
simple
need
to
get
paid
from
his
licensing
activities.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
stations
would
take
one
or
more
pictures
from
c
&
c.
lastly,
we
say,
that
this
practice
in
the
case
of
c
&
c
was
very
reasonable,
because
in
the
first
place,
the
device
of
insisting
on
minimum
spots
was
no
greater
than
c
&
c
needed
to
protect
this
interest
in
getting
paid.
secondly,
it
had
no
anticompetitive
results.
the
stations
were
not
precluded
by
any
c
&
c
contract
from
licensing
hundreds
and
thousands
of
other
feature
films
from
other
suppliers
and
other
program
material
from
their
resource.
no
supplier
of
feature
films
or
television
program
was
ever
precluded
by
a
c
&
c
license
from
doing
business
with
that
same
station.
the
second
circuit
in
(inaudible)
said
this
very
--
in
this
very
situation
that
where
you
have
a
tie-in
with
no
anticompetitive
effects,
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
law
and
this
court
denied
certiorari,
and
this
in
turn
is
exactly
the
kind
of
situation
mr.
black
posed
as
a
hypothetical
case
in
northern
pacific
when
he
said,
"if
there
are
a
number
of
groceries
in
town
and
one
will
only
sell
sugar,
if
the
buyer
takes
flour
and
nobody
is
hurt,
this
is
insignificant
tie-in."
in
conclusion,
we
say
first
that
it
would
be
impossible
as
the
government
suggested
in
its
brief
for
c
&
c
to
revise
its
contract
with
international
latex
because
unless
latex
got
all
of
the
spots
it
needs
for
its
exposure
program,
it
would
do
no
business
with
c
&
c.
and
lastly,
we
say
where
the
first
circuit
and
other
courts
that
the
antitrust
laws
do
not
compel
a
business
like
c
&
c
to
cut
its
own
throat
by
licensing
on
a
basis
from
which
it
could
receive
no
income.
