justice
byron
r.
white
in
which,
mr.
friedman?
justice
byron
r.
white
out
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
more
than
how
much?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
you
feel
that
this
court
has
held
unequivocally
that
to
tie
two
contrary
articles
together
that
are
hearsay
a
violation
of
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
your
--
did
you
feel
the
lower
court
have
directed
its
decision
on
that
proposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
stand
on
that
proposition
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
do
you
stand
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
trying
to
understand
you
get
some
other
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
that
i
suppose
that
this
court
has
held
that
any
time
you
force
somebody
to
take
something
and
he
doesn't
want
it,
he
won't
need
to
pay
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
when
i
wanted
to
sell
you
100
films
and
you'd
say
--
you
would
buy
100
films
and
then
i
say
if
you
get
the
100,
you
have
to
take
another
100.
now,
you
don't
want
those
other
films
not
by
long
term
but
to
get
that
100
if
you
want,
you
can
buy
the
200
and
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
that's
just
hearsay
in
this
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
the
products
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
said
just
treating
each
particular
picture
as
a
separate
product.
that's
your
--
that's
what
you
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
bad
films
and
good
films.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
one
of
--
the
major
part
of
your
position
is
that
this
is
just
an
extension
of
the
copyright
and
i
believe
it's
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
court
held
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
rested
firmly
on
that
and
nothing
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
on
the
theory
of
the
copyright,
one
picture,
i
believe
was
a
copyrighted
product.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
would
be
again
a
competitive
effect
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
product
is
the
particular
copyrighted
picture.
you're
not
going
to
have
any
competition
restraint
over
that
particular
picture
because
there's
only
one
evidence.
but
if
you're
going
to
say
it's
a
bad
picture,
you're
going
to
say
that
other
people
who
want
to
sell
bad
pictures
are
being
foreclosed
from
selling
bad
pictures
for
television.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
one
product.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
this
is
a
result,
what
do
you
need
to
show
if
it's
an
anticompetitive
effect
or
not.
i
suppose
you're
arguing
that
once
you
tie
the
copyrighted
films
together,
its
hearsay
and
reasonably
going
to
show
any
anticompetitive
effect.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
--
justice
byron
r.
white
all
i'm
saying
is
that
if
they
--
as
i
ask
you,
you're
just
relying
on
the
fact
you
don't
have
to
show
any
anticompetitive
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
do
want
to
talk
about
anticompetitive
effects.
