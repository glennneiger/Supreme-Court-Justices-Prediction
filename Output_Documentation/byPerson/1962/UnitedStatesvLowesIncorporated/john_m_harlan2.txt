page
is
that
please?
justice
john
m.
harlan
all
of
these
are
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean,
when
you
say
that
all
of
the
defendants
undertook
to
furnish
these
films
in
packages,
do
you
mean
offer
them
in
packages
or
the
condition
there
--
a
use
of
any
of
them
upon
the
use
of
all?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i'm
asking.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
how
it
was
exonerated.
justice
john
m.
harlan
17
out
of
how
many?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
only
instance
of
the
practice?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
aren't
you
making
some
assumptions
there
if
you
assume
that
the
--
in
the
case
that
the
district
court
found
as
he
did
that
the
purchaser
wanted
to
do
this
to
protect
himself?
isn't
that
a
very
different
case
where
he
acts
to
apply
the
whole
--
whole
group
of
pictures
because
he
can't
get
them
because
of
a
condition
imposed
by
the
seller?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
the
first
case
at
the
time
of
this
kind
that
the
government
brought?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
a
government
suit.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
meant
this
practice.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
is
the
figure
of
the
59?
mr.
friedman
said
17
out
of
59,
how
do
they
--
how
does
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
see.
justice
john
m.
harlan
had
their
copyright
run
out
in
any
of
these
films?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
we
--
are
we
to
deal
with
this
case
and
the
assumption
that
all
of
these
films
are
copyrighted?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
haven't
heard
anybody
suggest
the
contrary
of
the
district
court
--
