mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
civil
antitrust
case,
here
on
direct
appeal
to
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
it
presents
issues
relating
to
the
legality
under
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
of
the
block
booking
of
feature
motion
pictures
for
television
exhibition
and
also
questions
relating
to
appropriate
relief
to
deal
with
that
practice.
block
booking
is
defined
as
the
practice
by
the
distributors
of
motion
pictures
of
requiring
television
stations
in
order
to
license
certain
pictures,
generally
the
pictures
which
they
desire
to
also
accept
other
pictures
generally
pictures
which
they
did
not
desire.
and
the
phrase
"block
booking"
refers
to
the
fact
that
when
these
pictures
are
offered,
they
are
generally
offered
in
blocks
of
packages
of
varying
numbers,
50,
60,
or
100
and
200.
and
the
issue
as
presented
arises
from
the
fact
as
the
district
court
found
that
these
defendants
in
offering
the
pictures
had
on
numerous
occasions
refused
to
permit
the
stations
to
select
among
the
packages
and
had
required
them
to
take
the
entire
package.
there
are
six
defendants
in
the
case,
each
of
whom
is
a
distributor
of
feature
motion
pictures
for
television.
this
particular
case
involves
features
known
as
pre-1948
features.
those
are
old
motion
pictures
that
were
distributed
and
shown
in
theaters
prior
to
1948.
the
district
court
held
that
each
defendant
had
violated
the
sherman
act
by
block
booking
and
granted
injunctive
relief
and
both
sides
of
appeal
to
this
court,
the
government
as
well
as
five
of
the
defendants.
now,
i
might
just
say
in
passing
that
of
course
all
of
these
motion
pictures
involved
are
copyrighted.
the
issues
in
the
case
fall
into
two
distinct
categories.
there
are
questions
relating
to
the
substantive
issues
and
questions
relating
to
the
relief.
the
substantive
issues
tended
by
the
defendants
in
their
appeal
of
substantive
issue
was
this,
the
defendants
do
not
challenge
the
findings
of
the
district
court
that
they
had
entered
into
block
book
contracts.
they
do,
however,
challenge
the
court's
finding
that
these
block
book
contracts
were
illegal.
the
government's
appeal
challenges
the
district
court's
failure
to
find
that
a
block
contract
arising
out
of
another
set
of
circumstances
that
i
shall
detail
in
my
opinion
was
not
illegal.
now,
on
the
relief
issues,
the
defendant's
appeal
argues
that
no
relief
at
all
should
have
been
granted
against
the
violations
which
the
district
court
found.
conversely,
the
government's
appeal
argues
that
additional
relief
was
required.
and
in
my
oral
argument,
i
shall
discuss
the
points
in
that
order.
first,
i
shall
discuss
the
question
of
violation,
and
second,
the
question
of
relief.
but
before
coming
to
my
argument
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
correct
four
errors
which
the
defendants
have
pointed
out
that
we
have
most
regretfully
made
in
our
reply
brief.
this
is
the
brief,
the
united
states
in
reply
to
appellant's
brief
in
numbers
43
and
number
44.
it's
an
intermediate-sized
brief
of
20
pages.
the
first
error
is
at
page
8
about
one-third
of
the
way
down
in
the
first
not
full
paragraph,
the
last
sentence
beginning
finally
one
of
loew's
own
sales
reports
discloses
that
in
september
1957,
that
date
should
be
1956.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
8.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
the
brief
--
it's
the
caption
briefed
for
the
united
states
in
reply
to
appellant's
briefs
in
number
43
and
number
44.
all
of
the
errors
are
in
this
brief
which
is
the
medium-sized
brief
of
the
government.
that's
on
page
8,
the
date
should
be
september
1956.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
--
no
mr.
justice.
these
are
four
errors
primarily
relating
to
the
dates
given
in
this
brief.
on
page
17,
six
lines
down
from
the
top,
the
matter
in
parenthesis
about
one
month
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint
is
unfortunately
should
be
13
months
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
page
17,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
13
months,
that's
correct.
in
footnote
11,
halfway
down
the
beginning
of
the
sixth
line
where
the
witness
testified
on
several
occasions
that
should
be
one
occasion.
we
overstated
the
record
in
that
case.
and
finally,
on
page
19,
in
the
middle
of
the
page
again,
the
date
1957
should
be
1956.
we
read
exceedingly
these
errors,
we
have
no
apology
to
make
for
them
that
they
are
incorrect
and
we
don't
think
these
errors
in
any
way
vitiate
our
position
that
the
defendants
booking
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
does
not,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
on
page
19,
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
was
released
in
1957
that
should
be
1956.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
now,
coming
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
the
government
in
1957
filed
six
separate
cases
against
the
defendants.
each
case
alleged
that
the
particular
defendant
had
engaged
in
illegal
block
booking.
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
in
these
cases,
there's
no
charge
of
any
conspiracy
or
concerted
action
against
all
the
defendants.
each
case
was
a
separate
case
against
each
defendant.
although
as
i
shall
develop
in
my
argument,
we
think
the
record
shows
that
there
was
a
common
pattern,
a
common
method
by
which
films
were
distributed
to
the
industry,
that
is
the
practice
of
conditioning
them
and
selling
them
in
blocks.
now
in
1956,
early
in
1956,
there
had
been
no
substantial
distribution
yet
of
these
old
movies
to
television,
and
the
motion
picture
companies,
which
had
large
libraries
of
films,
included
that
they
had
a
very
valuable
asset
which
they
wish
to
realize
on.
and
they
undertook
beginning
in
1956
to
distribute
these
old
movies
to
television.
they
did
it
in
various
ways.
some
of
the
motion
picture
companies
themselves
distributed
them.
in
other
instances,
some
of
the
defendants
acquired
the
right
to
license
these
pictures
to
television
from
the
motion
picture
companies
by
substantial
cash
payments.
the
method
by
which
they
distributed
it
varied.
for
example,
loew's
in
the
first
instance
attempted
to
sell
its
entire
library
of
723
films.
other
defendants
distributed
the
pictures
in
smaller
packages.one
of
them
distributed
13
packages
of
58
pictures
each.
but
in
the
course
of
this
distribution,
two
things,
we
think,
stand
out.
the
first
is
that
all
of
them
undertook
to
distribute
their
films
in
packages
that
with
one
exception,
none
of
them
priced
the
films
individually.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
vary
from
the
early
period
of
the
20s
to
1928
or
1929
down
to
1948.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
in
this
case.
this
case
only
involves
films
made
before
1948.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
they
offered
them
all
in
packages
and
the
district
court
found
that
a
number
of
instances
they
had
conditioned
them.
we
don't
contend
of
course
that
in
every
case,
every
contract
presented
into.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
one
other
factor
about
them
is
that
where
they
undertook
to
sell
in
smaller
packages,
not
the
entire
view
of
package
of
39
or
package
of
58
or
52,
they
all
set
up
what
they
called
balance
packages.
that
is,
there
was
no
package
which
contained
39
outstanding
movies.
every
package
had
some
good
pictures,
some
average
pictures
and
some
poor
pictures.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
that's
--
the
theater
seem
to
think,
the
station
seem
to
think
they
were
good
and
they
--
the
evidence
indicates
as
i
shall
develop
that
there
were
many
instances
which
the
stations
didn't
want
affirmatively
some
of
them.
i
think
even
those
who
are
critical
of
television
recognizes
some
of
these
old
movies
were
pretty
good.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct,
they
vary
completely.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
station
set
up
with
it
thought
it
would
be
a
balanced
package.
in
other
words,
they
have
some
desirable
pictures,
they
have
some
poor
pictures.
now,
there's
also
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
except
to
this
extent,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice
that
generally,
it
was
felt
that
the
older
pictures
were
sometimes
less
desirable.
for
example,
people
would
recognize
the
old
customs,
the
old
automobiles,
but
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
packages
were
divided
up
in
terms
of
age
of
pictures.
they
were
in
what
they
thought
was
the
quality
of
the
pictures.
the
cases
were
consolidated
for
trial
and
after
an
extensive
trial.
the
district
court
held
that
each
defendant
had
engaged
in
illegal
block
booking.
as
to
five
of
the
defendants,
the
district
court
found
that
specific
contracts
entered
into
by
each
defendant
were
illegally
block
booked.
i'll
come
to
those
in
a
moment
but
i'd
like
to
just
in
passing,
refer
to
the
sixth
defendant
a
corporation
known
as
the
c
&
c
super
corporation.
without
going
into
the
facts
in
detail,
this
company
followed
a
somewhat
different
practice.
because
in
order
to
finance
the
films
which
it
had
purchased
from
rko,
it
found
it
necessary
to
enter
into
an
agreement
with
the
international
latex
corporation
under
which
the
international
latex
corporation
made
available
to
c
&
c
certain
payments
which
c
&
c
and
their
current
venues
to
pay
off
the
cost
of
its
film
line.
and
the
condition
for
international
latex
making
these
payments
available
to
c
&
c
was
that
c
&
c
in
turn
would
procure
certain
television
time
for
international
latex.
and
c
&
c
had
no
right
to
any
payments
from
international
latex
unless
it
receives
certain
minimum
amounts,
certain
minimum
airspace
or
air
time
on
behalf
of
these
pictures.
and
the
district
court
held
that
with
respect
to
this
company
that
the
result
of
this
agreement
was
to
force
it
to
operate
under
a
policy
of
block
booking.
and
the
court
found
it
was
unnecessary
to
find
any
where
the
particular
contracts
for
block
book
as
the
court
held
in
effect,
all
of
those
contracts
had
to
be
block
booked.
in
other
words,
they
were
unable
because
of
their
financing
arrangements
to
enter
into
anything
less
than
a
contract
covering
a
substantial
number
of
pictures.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
on
the
contrary
that
their
argument
is
that
it
exonerated
and
that
was
an
ancillary
restraint
and
we
think
it
clearly
was
not
an
ancillary
restraint
of
whatever
it
may
have
been
the
business
reasons
for
c
&
c
entering
into
this
agreement,
it
could
not
justify
block
booking
in
order
to
accomplish
its
business
aims.
now,
the
--
as
a
proof
developed
at
the
trial,
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
the
government
contended
that
a
total
of
59
contracts
of
the
other
five
defendants
had
been
illegally
block
booked.
the
district
court
held
that
a
total
of
17
have
been
block
booked
breaking
down
or
entering
all
the
way
from
two
contracts
by
some
of
the
companies
to
five
of
the
others.
the
total
payments
involved
under
these
17
contracts
that
have
been
found
illegally
block
booked
were
more
than
$3
million.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
out
of
59
that
were
challenged
by
the
government.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
17
out
of
59.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
$3
million
of
commerce
involved
in
the
contract
specifically
found
block
booked.
of
these
17
contracts,
six
of
them
involving
four
of
the
five
defendants,
all
of
the
defendants
other
than
screen
gems
company
were
entered
into
after
these
suits
have
been
filed.
now,
the
record
in
this
case
contains
extensive
testimony
by
many
representatives
of
television
stations
called
by
the
government
that
they
purchased
films
which
they
did
not
want.
and
in
some
instances
films
which
they
did
not
use
because
this
was
the
only
way
they
could
get
the
desirable
films
in
the
package.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
give
the
court
two
examples
relating
to
the
negotiations
of
contracts
which
the
district
court
specifically
found
had
been
block
booked.
the
first
one
involves
a
contract
which
loew's
made
with
a
station
in
march
of
1958
for
the
entire
library
of
723
films
that
loew's
offered.
the
station
representative
testified
they
only
wanted
to
take
500
because
as
they
said,
"we
felt
that
these
approximately
200
films,
200
leftover
were
a
group
of
films
that
we
would
never
use
on
the
station
at
all."
but
he
replied
that
the
loew's
representative
made
it
very
clear
that
we
either
bought
the
whole
package
and
that
we
could
not
call
from
it
take
anything
out
of
it,
and
that
was
it,
so
we
renegotiated
for
the
whole
package.
this
material
is
at
the
record
709
--
907,
908,
and
909,
915,
and
916,
it
is
set
forth
in
our
brief.
now,
at
the
time
this
witness
testified
at
the
trial
in
march
of
1960,
approximately
two
years
after
this
contract
had
been
entered
into,
they
stated
that
they
had
not
yet
run
these
200
pictures,
that
they
had
no
plan
to
run
them
at
that
time,
and
the
reason
they
were
not
planning
to
run
them
was
they
said
was,
"because
there
are
so
many
pictures
in
the
group
that
we
feel
do
not
come
up
to
the
standard
of
the
operation
of
our
station
and
the
programming
that
we
want
to
give
the
people.
that's
one
example
the
contract
found
block
book
where
the
station
was
required
to
take
200
films
which
it
not
only
didn't
want,
but
was
unable
to
show.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
are
individual
stations
in
one
or
two
examples.
they
may
have
been
stations
which
had
a
small
network.
for
example,
the
storer
broadcasting
company
had
a
chain
of
five
stations
and
triangle
public,
inc.
they
were
not
dealing
with
the
network.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
now,
the
second
example
involved
the
defendant's
c
&
c
corporation
which
is
i
indicated
followed
on
how
it
had
this
policy
of
block
booking.
and
among
the
films
included
in
the
rko
library
which
were
part
of
the
package
wasn't
foreign
language
pictures.
these
stations
were
also
required
to
take
and
the
owner
or
operator
of
a
station
in
huntington,
west
virginia
explained
that
he
didn't
have
much
of
the
market
for
foreign
language
pictures
in
that
area.
now,
what
the
record
we
think
shows
in
this
case
is
something
rather
unusual
in
a
tying
case.
we
have
in
this
record
affirmative
testimony,
testimony
of
the
station
owners
which
establishes
the
very
vice
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
adverted
to
in
condemning
tying
agreements.
that
is
the
fact
that
the
necessary
result
of
a
tying
agreement
is
to
force
the
buyer
to
take
something
he
doesn't
want,
and
that's
precisely
what
this
record
shows.
television
stations
were
forced
as
a
result
of
these
block
book
contracts
to
take
films
they
didn't
want.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
court
has
also
pointed
in
the
tying
agreements.
the
inevitable
effect
of
these
agreements
is
to
foreclose
competing
sellers
at
the
tied
product
from
having
access
to
that
segment
of
the
market
and
similarly
here,
we
think,
it's
quite
clear
that
in
the
hypothetical
case
i
gave
a
moment
ago
involving
loew's,
when
they
were
forced
to
take
the
200
pictures
they
didn't
want,
a
competing
seller
of
these
poor
motion
pictures
though
they
may
be
was
excluded
from
that
segment
of
the
market
covered
by
the
tied
contract.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
think
so
mr.
justice
white
and
i'm
just
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
think
we
stand
on
two
things.
we
think
first
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes,
we
do.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
we
stand
on
that
proposition
and
i
would
like
to
come
to
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice,
the
court
has
recognized
--
the
court
has
pointed
out
that
as
long
as
he
has
--
it
requires
two
things,
it
requires
there'd
be
sufficient
economic
power.
it
has
to
have
an
appreciable
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
there
we
have
the
same
product,
whereas
in
this
case,
we
have
different
product.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
case,
the
product
is
a
copyrighted
motion
picture.
each
of
which
is
necessarily
a
unique
product
as
the
district
court
held.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
--
if
i
may
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
that's
right.
it's
not
bad
films
and
good
films.
it's
the
requirement
that
in
order
to
get
some
copyrighted
pictures
--
to
get
more
--
to
get
a
particular
copyrighted
film,
they
have
to
take
another
copyrighted
film.
now,
of
course,
if
you
had
just
one
film,
that
might
not
be
enough
because
you
have
to
have
a
substantial
restraint
on
interstate
commerce
but
again
it
could
depend
on
the
value
of
the
film.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
and
we
believe,
mr.
justice,
that's
what
the
court
specifically
held
in
the
paramount
case.
i'd
like
to
come
to
the
paramount
case
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
court
below
held
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
par
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
rested
on
paramount
and
the
other
tying
cases
of
this
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
that
is
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
decision.
and
we
think
the
paramount
case
is
controlling
on
this
point.
in
the
paramount
case,
this
court
specifically
held
that
the
block
booking
of
motion
pictures
for
theatrical
exhibition
was
a
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
it
specifically
held
that
it
was
bad
because
it
was
an
attempt
to
enlarge
on
the
monopoly
of
a
single
copyright
to
tie
other
copyrighted
films
to
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
by
requiring
them
to
take
723
when
they
only
wanted
500,
this
excluded
competing
sellers
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
one
of
the
other
defendants
perhaps
might
want
to
sell
the
poor
pictures
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
each
one
of
these
pictures
is
unique.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
competition
is
selling
--
complete
selling,
competing
films
even
though
each
film
is
unique
otherwise
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
some
people
think
that.
i
would
put
it
this
way
if
i
may,
mr.
justice.
there's
a
market.
there's
a
limited
market
for
motion
pictures.
television
station
can
only
use
or
sell
many.
if
one
distributor
comes
in
and
says,
"here's
700."
you
have
to
take
them,
and
they
say,
"we
don't
want
700,
we
want
500",
and
then
say,
"it
makes
no
difference
at
all."
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
they
want
to
exclude
particular
pictures.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they're
forced
to
take
those
particular
pictures.
this
necessarily
means
that
someone
else
who
would
be
selling
them
pictures
that
they
wanted
in
place
of
those
200
is
excluded
from
that
segment
of
the
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
this
is
really
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
but
i'm
just
illustrating
the
evils
which
flow
from
these
tying
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
the
northern
pacific
case
if
i
may
give
as
an
example.
there
it
said
that
one
of
the
evils
of
the
agreements
by
the
railroad
which
required
the
lessees
and
owners
of
land
to
rule
traffic
by
the
railroad
was
that
competing
sales
of
transportation
would
necessarily
exclude
to
the
extent
that
the
lessees
and
the
people
who
would
purchase
property
from
northern
pacific
shipped
on
northern
pacific
in
reliance
on
these
agreements,
other
sales
of
transportation
were
excluded
from
the
market.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
but
i
might
point
out,
mr.
justice,
in
northern
pacific
case,
we
did
not
have
the
copyrights.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
did
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
no
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
each
one
--
the
reason
they're
able
to
do
this,
mr.
justice,
the
reason
they're
able
to
accomplish
this
here
is
because
of
the
fact
that
they
had
to
copyright
monopoly
on
the
particular
pictures
which
the
stations
wanted.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
don't
know
if
it
said
it
has
to
be
restraint.
i'm
not
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
northern
pacific
merely
illustrated
the
inevitable
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
i
may
put
it
this
way.
they
are
being
foreclosed
from
a
market
for
motion
pictures
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
can't
say
its
one
product.
it
is
a
--
it
is
a
copyrighted
film,
its
one
product
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
precisely
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
assume
that
since
part
of
the
price
they
paid
for
the
library,
part
of
the
price
they
paid
for
the
library
reflected
these
200
pictures.
i
was
not
suggesting
there
were
instances
of
course
in
which
the
stations
did
play
the
pictures.
they
did
not
wish
to
purchase.
i'm
just
showing
that
this
is
an
example
of
how
the
effect
of
these
clauses
was
to
force
them
to
take
pictures
which
they
didn't
want.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
precisely.
and
i
think
all
of
these
--
all
of
these
problems,
mr.
justice
white
that
you
have
raised
were
also
inherent
in
the
paramount
situation.
and
there
this
court
seem
to
have
no
problem
withholding
that
as
it
stated,
it's
a
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
don't
think
that
this
distinction
is
this
part
that
it's
significant,
mr.
justice
because
in
both
instances,
in
both
instances
whether
it's
the
thing
that
the
state,
the
theatre
depends
on
entirely
or
it's
something
which
the
television
station
either
wants.
in
both
instances,
it
requires
them
to
take
copyrighted
pictures
that
they
don't
want
in
order
to
get
a
copyrighted
picture
which
they
do
and
we
think
this
is
an
invalid
extension
of
the
copyright
monopoly.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
this
comes
to
our
argument
on
the
relief.
we
think
that
that
is
an
impermissible
way
of
doing
indirectly
which
we
don't
think
they
can
do
directly.
now,
the
next
thing
i
would
like
to
come
to,
i
think
i'm
going
into
fully
enough
the
problem
of
the
legality
of
these
agreements
as
i
say
we
think
they
are
illegal
under
the
sherman
act
and
i
would
like
to
come
to
the
issue
now
posed
by
the
government's
appeal
which
is
something
we
have
called
interim
or
temporary
block
booking.
i'd
like
to
give
an
example
which
is
the
example
given
by
the
district
court
in
its
findings.
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
there
are
six
or
seven
instances
of
this
practice.
the
practice
is
as
follows;
a
distributor
comes
into
a
television
station,
says,
"well,
we
have
a
package.
we'd
like
to
sell
you
the
package."
the
station
owner
looks
and
says,
"well,
i'd
like
to
take
some
of
these
films.
these
are
very
fine
and
i
don't
want
some
others",
well
as
they
say,
"break
the
package.
will
you
let
me
have
some?"
the
individual
distributor
says,
"no.
at
this
time,
we
will
not
break
the
package.
we're
going
to
go
around
and
see
if
we
can
sell
you
--
sell
the
entire
package
to
one
of
your
competitive
stations
in
the
market.
and
if
we
can't,
then
we'll
come
back
and
talk
to
you
about
taking
individual
pictures."
at
this
point,
the
station
then
says,
"well,
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
loew's
in
them
all,
we'll
enter
into
a
package.
and
they
entered
into
a
package
deal
for
the
entire
group
of
pictures.
the
district
court
held
that
this
practice
was
not
an
illegal
tie-in
contract.
the
district
court
held
that
a
defendant
as
he
quoted,
"a
distributor
has
the
right
to
test
out
the
market
to
see
whether
he
can
sell
a
part
of
the
package,"
the
whole
package
before
undertaking
negotiations
for
a
part,
and
therefore
he
said,
"such
a
contract
was
not
illegally
block
booked."
we
think
this
was
wrong
and
we
think
this
is
wrong
basically
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
fundamental
vise
of
the
block
book
tie-in
contract
forcing
the
stations
to
take
some
pictures
in
order
to
get
others
is
equally
present
whether
the
refusal
to
deal
is
for
an
interim
period,
pending
an
attempt
to
sell
the
package
elsewhere
or
whether
it
is
in
terms
a
complete
refusal
to
deal
and
absolutely
within
both
instances,
if
the
station
enters
into
a
tied
contract,
it
is
in
those
circumstances
it
is
required
to
take
pictures
that
it
doesn't
want
as
a
condition
to
getting
other
pictures.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
in
each
instance
i
think,
mr.
justice,
it
is
done
because
he
wants
to
get
particular
pictures.
he's
trying
to
protect
himself
in
both
instances.
in
the
first
instance,
he's
also
protecting
himself
because
the
only
way
he
can
get
the
good
pictures
is
by
taking
the
ones
he
doesn't
want
in
the
whole
package
and
i
think
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
rose,
i
was
discussing
the
question
of
the
so-called
interim
refusal
to
deal
except
on
a
block
book
basis
and
i
attempted
to
point
out
that
in
terms
of
the
effectiveness
on
these
television
stations,
the
effect
is
the
same
whether
they
purchased
the
complete
package
including
films
that
they
don't
want
because
in
the
first
instance,
they're
offered
only
the
complete
package
or
in
the
second
instance,
they
told
that
they
cannot
select
individually
unless
and
until
the
station
offers
the
entire
package
to
the
competitors.
now,
i
think
in
a
realistic
sense,
this
distinction
between
the
temporary
refusal
to
deal
and
the
permanent
refusal
to
deal
really
doesn't
amount
to
very
much
because
i
think
fairly
it
can
be
said
that
when
a
distributor
comes
to
a
particular
television
station
say
in
the
washington
market
and
says,
"here
is
a
package",
and
the
station
says,
"can
i
have
less
than
the
package?"
and
the
station
says,
"no,
you
have
to
take
the
whole
package."
implicit
in
this,
of
course,
is
a
notion
that
they're
going
to
try
to
sell
the
package
as
a
package
elsewhere
in
this
market.
and
if
everyone
of
the
stations
in
the
washington
area
refused
to
buy
the
package,
it
seems
likely
that
the
next
step
they're
going
to
do
is
to
then
come
back
and
attempt
to
sell
as
much
of
it
as
possible.
so
that
we
think
in
the
situation
where
they
say,
no,
we're
not
going
to
negotiate
with
you
for
individual
pictures
until
we've
had
an
opportunity
to
sell
them
elsewhere
in
the
market.
this
is
really
making
explicit,
what
we
think
is
implicit
in
every
situation
where
there's
an
absolute
refusal
to
sell
less
than
the
entire
package
pending
an
attempt
to
sell
the
entire
package
to
the
entire
market.
and
we
think
that
both
of
these
situations
are
equally
illegal
that
it's
not
a
question
--
it's
testing
the
market
in
both
situations
because
when
the
distributor
who
refuses
at
all
to
negotiate
for
less
than
a
package
does
so
he
again
is
testing
the
market.
he's
trying
to
see
if
he
can't
sell
it
to
the
first
station
to
sell
it
to
one
of
the
other
stations.
and
when
it's
done,
said,
we're
only
going
to
do
this
temporarily.
this
is
basically
the
same
thing
and
we
think
that
in
any
realistic
sense,
these
two
types
of
contract,
these
block
contracts,
are
basically
separate
from
the
same
vice
in
each
instance,
there
is
the
illegal
tie-in
and
we
think
that
they
are
both
illegal,
and
we
think
in
these
circumstances
the
district
court
should
have
held
that
this
type
of
situation
is
also
illegal
and
should
have
enjoined
its
use.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
could
always
--
he
cannot
offer
in
a
block
if
the
station
is
required
to
buy
some
in
order
to
get
others.
if
the
station
voluntarily
says
we'd
like
to
buy
them
all,
they,
of
course,
are
free
to
sell
them
in
a
block,
and
that
the
judgment
so
provides
and
we
do
not
question
that.
all
that
we
say
and
that
i'll
come
to
a
moment
in
our
relief
provisions,
as
we
said,
they
have
to
offer
them
individually.
but
there's
nothing
--
once
they
have
offered
them
individually
to
preclude
them
negotiating
a
deal
for
any
number
that
the
station
wants
to
take.
it's
the
station.
if
the
station
voluntarily
wants
to
take
a
package
of
film
then
it
says,
"we
want
your
whole
library.
we'd
like
to
buy
your
whole
library."
this
is
perfectly
proper
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
we
think
this
is
legitimate
business.
but
we
think
what
they
cannot
do
is
come
in
to
the
station
and
say,
"here
is
the
package
and
you
have
to
take
some
in
order
to
get
others."
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
range
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
any
six
that
the
station
wants.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
--
let
me
put
it
this
way
mr.
justice.
i
think
if
we
have
nothing
else
in
this
record,
if
that's
all
we
had,
i
wouldn't
think
this
would
have
been
much
of
a
case.
but
of
course
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
that's
right,
if
they
initially
come
and
say,
you,
in
order
to
get
any
pictures
from
us,
you
have
to
get
six.
now,
i
would
also
say
that
if
the
--
therefore,
i
want
to
reiterate
this
because
there
seems
to
be
misunderstanding.
the
defendant
suggests
that
we
are
preventing
them
from
selling
pictures
in
groups,
we're
not.
well,
they're
perfectly
free
if
the
station
wants
to
take
a
picture
together
in
a
group,
they're
perfectly
free
to
enter
into
these
negotiations.
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
surely,
the
station
--
if
the
station
says,
"we'd
like
six",
the
thing
about
it
is,
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
if
the
station
wants
six
pictures,
good
pictures
or
bad
pictures,
it
should
be
free
to
select
the
pictures
that
wants.
the
owner
of
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
he
cannot
say
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
cannot
say
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
surely,
surely.
he
can
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
can
persuade
them
but
not
coerce
them
into
buying
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
would
have
to
say,
mr.
justice,
i
would
think
that
would
be
bad
because
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
because
again
he's
conditioning.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right,
it
rest
on
those
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
been
condemned.
and
we
think
that
they
cannot.
they
cannot
in
the
course
of
their
negotiations
require
the
stations
to
take
pictures.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
result
might
be
different
depending
on
the
degree
of
power,
economic
power
they
had
in
the
market
but
we
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
don't
think
we
get
back
to
the
colgate
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
might.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
we
think
here,
the
copyright
does
apply
as
i've
indicated
in
the
market
on
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
smallest
--
there
is
one
instance
of
one
package
i
think
of
seven
which
is
not
frequently
referred.
but
in
most
instances
the
smallest
i
think
is
in
fact
and
that
was
26
and
there
were
39,
52,
58
and
so
on.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
let
me
if
i
may
put
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
no,
mr.
justice.
let
me
see
if
i
can
explain
it
this
way.
the
northern
pacific
case
enunciated
the
doctrine
that
in
order
for
a
tie-in
agreement
to
be
illegal,
the
seller
must
have
certain
in
this
year
of
economic
power
over
the
tying
product.
now
we
think
northern
pacific
was
not
a
patent
or
copyrighted
case
and
at
this
time,
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
times-picayune
case
where
the
tying
product
is
patented
or
copyrighted,
then
that
fact
itself
supplies
the
necessary
market
power.
if
there
is
not
a
patent
or
copyright,
then
it
turns
on
the
basically
the
amount
of
the
tying
product
that's
involved.
and
i
would
not
concede
that
if
these
products
were
not
copyrighted
at
the
amount
of
the
number
of
pictures
that
these
defendants
have
would
not
be
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
sir.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it
would
still
be
the
different
films,
i
suppose.
now,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
the
relief
in
this
case.
the
district
court
upon
finding
that
each
defendant
had
violated
the
act
concluded
record
47
and
an
injunction
should
of
course
be
granted.
the
court
further
stated
that
the
necessity
for
such
an
injunction
flows
from
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
present
state
of
licensing
of
feature
films
to
the
television
industry.
we
think
the
district
court
was
clearly
correct
in
deciding
that
injunctive
relief
should
be
granted
against
these
violations.
the
court
found
that
each
defendant
had
violated
the
act
while
the
telephone
number
of
contracts
found
who
have
been
block
booked
was
not
large
admittedly
in
relation
to
the
total
number
of
these
parties
contract.
they
never
list
words
of
substantial
number.
it
involved
a
substantial
segment
of
commerce,
and
it's
well
settled,
i
won't
burden
the
court
with
the
rule
that
upon
a
finding
of
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws,
the
district
court
has
the
duty
to
enter
an
appropriate
relief
that
will
cure
the
violations
and
protect
the
public
against
their
recurrence.
i
won't
attempt
to
take
up
the
arguments
of
each
of
the
individual
defendants
as
to
the
particular
violations
found
and
particular
evidence
showing
the
continuation
of
these
practices.
i
just
point
out
one
thing,
the
case
of
the
defendant
loew's.
defendant
loew's
is
the
only
one
of
these
defendants,
which
in
1957,
made
a
public
announcement
to
the
trade
that
it
would
then
support
licensed
pictures
individually
any
number
from
one
to
723.
no
other
defendant
publicized
any
such
notice.
but
and
we
think
this
is
most
significant.
the
two
contracts
of
loew's
which
the
defendant
found
were
block
booked
were
made
in
1958
approximately
a
year
after
this
policy
have
been
announced.
so
we
think
the
district
court
was
clearly
correct
and
certainly
cannot
be
said
to
abuse
its
discretion
in
entering
an
injunction
and
i
now
like
to
turn
to
the
terms
of
the
court's
judgment.
the
court
entered
substantially
identical
judgments
as
to
all
of
the
defendants
and
we
have
used
for
less
than
the
purpose
of
the
judgment
in
the
first
case,
the
loew's
case
at
pages
52
to
53
of
the
record.
and
the
critical
portions
of
the
judgment
are
in
paragraphs
iv
and
v.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
--
no.
we
object
only
in
the
sense
we
don't
think
they
went
far
enough.
we
think
the
court
was
fully
justified
in
entering
these
provisions
but
we
think
these
provisions
need
strengthening
as
i
shall
develop.
the
provisions
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
52
and
53
of
volume
1
of
the
record.
the
judgment
provisions
in
paragraph
iv
(a)
enjoins
the
defendant
from
conditioning
or
tying
or
attempting
to
condition
or
tie
the
purchase
of
any
film
upon
the
purchase
or
license
of
any
other
film,
that's
in
(a).
(b),
substantial
repeats
that
but
it's
in
terms
of
conditioning
the
acceptance
of
a
film
for
showing
over
one
station
upon
taking
the
film
for
showing
in
other
stations.
and
(c)
prohibits
entering
into
any
agreement
to
sell
a
license
of
any
feature
film
in
which
the
differential
between
the
price
of
the
film
when
sold
individually
and
when
sold
as
part
of
a
package
has
the
effect
of
conditioning.
that
is
if
they
say,
"well,
here
are
these
pictures
and
individually
they're
priced
at
a,
b,
c,
$1000,
$2,000,
$2,500
but
if
you
take
them
all
in
a
package,
the
price
is
so
much."
the
court
prohibits
a
differential
between
the
price
of
the
picture
when
sold
individually
and
when
sold
as
part
of
the
package
which
has
the
effect
conditioning.
now,
i'd
like
to
explain
to
the
court
why
we
think
these
two
provisions
are
not
adequate
to
terminate
the
block
booking
which
has
existed
in
this
industry.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
all
of
the
defendants
attempted
to
sell
their
pictures
in
packages
that
one
exception
they
did
not
quote
individual
prices
that
no
salesman
had
authority
to
close
a
deal
for
individual
films.
they
could
close
the
package
but
if
individual
pictures
were
sold,
he
had
to
communicate
with
the
home
office.
and
of
course,
in
this
situation,
station
owner
who
was
offered
a
package
was
a
seller
who
then
testified
was
aware
that
the
package
during
these
negotiations
might
be
sold
to
a
rival
station.
but
in
addition
to
that
and
we
think
this
is
very
significant,
six
or
seven
different
station
representatives
testified
when
they
were
asked
whether
or
why
they
had
not
requested
distributors
to
sell
less
than
the
whole
package,
they
said,
"well,
we
were
conditioned
to
this.
this
was
the
way
business
was
done
in
this
industry."
as
one
station
representative
put
it
at
page
388
of
the
record,
"we
have
been
conditioned
in
this
business
for
years
now
to
think
in
terms
of
conditions
of
packages."
and
another
one
stated
at
record
736,
"it
was
the
way
the
industry
was
buying,
and
anytime
they
came
in
with
a
package,
you
knew
it
was
a
package
and
you
just
understood
it"
so
that
what
you
have
in
this
industry
is
a
history
of
selling
pictures
on
a
package
basis,
difficulties
experience
by
stations
in
getting
individual
pictures,
violations
found
by
the
court
of
a
number
of
contracts
that
were
tied,
and
a
recognition
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
were
the
buyers,
that
this
was
the
way
pictures
were
being
distributed.
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
filed
a
suit
in
1957.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
early
in
1956.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
no,
that's
from
1956
to
1960,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
after
the
time
the
case
was
tried.
of
course
this
aspect
of
the
industry
is
a
road
of
like
novel
industry.
in
other
words,
in
an
industry
where
this
is
only
been
going
on
for
four
years,
the
four
years
had
developed
into
the
accepted
practice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
against
block
booking
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
it's
the
first
case
that
the
government
has
brought
dealing
with
this
particular
practice.
we've
had
other
cases
relating
to
television.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
know
of
only
one,
mr.
justice,
which
is
a
fifth
circuit
decision
cited
by
the
court
of
--
district
court
in
its
opinion
which
involved
the
tying
of
warner
brothers
pictures
and
in
popeye
cartoons.
that's
the
only
one.
there
may
be
others
pending.
i
don't
know.
now,
we
think
that
this
general
provision
and
merely
enjoining
them
from
conditioning
or
tying
or
attempting
to
condition
or
tie
would
not
be
adequate
to
really
get
at
the
roots
of
this
problem.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
that
was
--
that
was
part
of
the
government's
aim,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct
and
we
are
--
we
are
suggesting
--
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
some
revisions
in
the
phraseology
of
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
with
respect
to
the
differential.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct.
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
one
but
we
also
did
not
get
into
the
qualifications
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
the
defendant
to
attempt
to
sell
or
license
such
group.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
that's
the
last
three
lines
of
(c)
on
73.
i
may
say,
mr.
justice,
i'm
not
sure
whether
offering
to
enter
might
not
be
covered
by
the
court's
prohibition
on
attempting
to
condition
or
tie.
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
justice,
if
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
would
--
i
think
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
would
have
gotten
(c)
but
i
don't
think
we
would
have
gotten
(d)
and
(f),
which
is
the
individual
--
we
want
the
individual
picture
by
picture
and
also
a
differential,
it
does
not
exceed
the
cost
and
saving
--
its
cost,
savings
and
distribution
or
selling.
now,
i
think
it's
significant
in
the
point
in
considering
the
district
court's
refusal
to
grant
the
government
this
relief
which
we
think
is
necessary,
that
is
that
the
stations
should
come
in
and
offer
the
pictures
individually.
let
me
just
dwell
on
that
for
a
moment.
whereas
i've
indicated,
we
are
not
suggesting
they
cannot
enter
into
a
contract
covering
the
entire
package
but
we
do
suggest
that
in
the
first
instance,
the
station
has
to
be
given
the
choice
of
which
pictures
it
wants.
and
we
think
the
--
in
the
light
of
the
history
of
this
practice,
the
only
way
that
such
a
choice
may
be
effectively
given
is
to
have
them
offer
each
picture
individually
and
each
picture
individually
priced.
now
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
if
that
reflected
a
saving
in
the
pack
--
and
being
able
to
sell
it
at
package.
but
coming
to
that
point,
mr.
justice,
the
record
here
indicates
many
instances,
we
think,
although
the
district
court
could
not
find
that
any
contract
had
illegally
been
block
booked
or
itself
is
differential.
the
record
shows
many
instances
in
which
there
was
a
tremendous
differential
between
the
prices
of
pictures
when
taken
individually
and
when
taken
as
part
of
a
package.
we've
set
a
number
of
those
out
in
our
brief.
for
example,
the
defendant
nta
and
one
of
its
packages
had
10
or
11
pictures
which
have
been
produced
by
david
o.
selznick
which
were
apparently
considered
extremely
desirable
by
the
television
stations.
in
some
instances
when
the
television
station
said,
"what
is
the
price
for
the
selznick's
alone?"
they
were
quoted
a
price
on
an
individual
picture
basis
for
the
selznick's
which
in
one
instance
was
more
than
the
total
price
of
the
package
of
30
or
40
films
and
another
instance
was
within
a
$1,000.
so
that
we
think
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
other
words,
mr.
justice,
let
me
explain
one
of
the
situations.
a
station
in
baltimore,
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
was
quoted
a
price
of
$61,000
for
the
10
selznick's.
and
after
that,
it
purchased
a
package
of
46
including
the
10
selznick's
for
$62,000.in
other
words,
it
was
being
priced
to
the
basis
of
buying
the
additional
36
films
for
$1,000
or
roughly
$25
to
$30
a
film
as
against
the
price
of
$6,000
for
each
of
the
selznick.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
in
the
course
of
--
i'm
sorry,
in
the
course
of
negotiations,
they
were
quoted
a
price
for
the
selznick's
which
came
to
within
$1,000
of
the
total
price
for
all
the
pictures
in
the
package
including
the
selznick.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
now,
there's
another
example
which
i
think
graphically
indicates
the
danger
of
this
and
how
this
can
be
used
to
illegally
condition.
loew's,
there's
an
exhibit
in
the
record,
exhibit
20,
loew's
exhibit
20
which
is
a
long
memorandum
that
loew's
put
out
to
its
salesmen
at
the
time
it
announced
this
new
practice
in
1957
in
april
that
it
would
sell
pictures
individually
and
it
listed,
instructed
there
was
to
be
no
conditioning,
pictures
would
be
sold
individually.
and
they
priced
the
pictures
individually
and
of
course,
we
don't
say
each
picture
has
to
be
priced
with
a
dollar
and
cents
amount.
you
don't
have
to
say,
"this
picture
is
$230.40."
the
station
is
perfectly
free
to
lump
a
group
of
pictures
together
so
these
pictures
are
all
category
b1,
the
price
is
$250
a
piece,
take
as
many
as
you
want.
and
after
the
pricing
have
been
set
up
and
the
announcement
of
the
policy,
loew's
had
included
with
a
schedule
of
discounts.
i
think
these
are
very
revealing.
they
announced
that
if
the
station
took
a
package
of
100
films
selected
by
loew's,
not
the
station's
choice,
but
selected
by
loew's,
then
in
that
event
there'd
be
a
25%
discount
from
the
individual.
if
they
selected
one-half
of
the
loew's
library
of
723
films
as
selected
by
loew's,
in
that
event,
37.5%
discount.
if
they
selected
the
entire
loew's
library,
a
discount
of
50%
from
the
prices
for
the
individual
films
and
this
was
coupled
with
greater
benefits
to
the
stations
in
terms
of
how
many
times
they
could
show
the
pictures,
for
how
long
they
would
have
the
right
to
show
the
pictures
if
they
took
one
of
these
loew's
packages
and
if
they
pick
individual
--

friedman
as
under
our
construction
of
the
judgment,
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
only
to
--
only
to
the
extent,
they
can
have
any
quantity
discount
to
the
extent
that
this
discount
reflects
a
difference
in
the
course
of
distribution.
i
think
the
reason
for
this
is
clear
because
when
they
give
a
discount
on
a
picture
in
a
package,
it
seems
to
us
it
can
only
be
for
one
of
two
reasons.
either
because
it's
costing
them
less
to
sell
it
which
we
think
is
alright
or
alternatively,
because
they're
trying
to
get
you
to
take
the
poorer
picture
along
with
the
good
one.
we
think
that's
bad
and
we
think
that
the
first
is
legal
as
permitted
by
our
judgment.
we
think
the
second
is
bad
as
prohibited
by
our
judgment.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
court's
decision
in
the
standard
oil
case
in
337
u.s.,
in
talking
about
its
previous
decision
in
international
salt,
it
pointed
out
that
in
international
salt,
the
court
had
held
that
the
tie-in
agreements
by
the
offer
of
a
patented
product,
which
required
the
lessee
of
the
salt
machines
to
take
unpatented
salt
was
held
illegal.
and
it
said,
it
so
held
even
though,
one,
it
was
not
established
that
equivalent
machines
were
unobtainable.
it
was
not
indicated
what
proportion
of
the
business
of
supplying
such
machines
was
controlled
by
defendant.
and
it
was
deemed
irrelevant
that
there
was
no
evidence
as
to
the
actual
effect
of
the
tie-in
causes
upon
competition.
second
one,
this
court's
own
opinion
in
the
times-picayune
case
which
mr.
nizer
has
relied
on,
specifically
pointed
out
in
distinguishing
the
situation
there
before
the
court
involving
neither
a
patented
nor
a
copyrighted
article
it
said
as
follows.
unlike
tie-in
cases,
where
patents
or
copyrights
supplied
the
requisite
market
control
any
equivalent
market
dominance
in
this
case
must
rest
on
comparative
marketing
data.
now,
we
think
that
this
case
is
taken
together
with
the
paramount
case
and
the
international
salt
case,
clearly
do
establish
that
in
a
tie-in
field
where
you
have
a
patent
or
a
copyrighted
article
that
itself
suffice
the
monopoly.
of
course,
these
films
are
not
fungible.
these
films
are
not
fungible.
there
are
two
things.
first
of
all,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
in
which
station
owners
did
testify
that
it
was
important
to
them
which
particular
pictures
they
have.
one
example
of
this
was
that
several
of
them
indicated
there
were
very
desires
of
getting
good
pictures
during
the
so-called
rating
weeks,
during
the
period
when
these
various
audience
surveys
were
made
to
see
how
many
people
were
looking
at
the
screen
because
this
was
important
for
them
to
try
to
get
a
good
picture
during
the
rating
week.
it
also
seems
to
me
the
suggestion
that
these
pictures
are
fungible
and
that
their
particular
identity
is
immaterial
to
the
stations
as
refuted
by
the
fact
that
the
stations
wanted
the
particular
pictures
and
did
not
want
other
pictures.
now,
i
would
like,
in
closing,
to
just
suggest
this.
if
the
defendants
are
correct
in
their
argument
that
the
lack
of
any
dominant
or
sufficient
economic
power
over
the
entire
market
absolves
these
contracts
from
invalidity
of
the
sherman
act,
this
would
lead
to
this
following
consequence.
let
us
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
every
single
distributor
of
theatrical
motion
pictures
to
television
entered
into
a
compulsory
block
contract
with
for
every
single
contract,
with
every
single
station
in
the
united
states,
the
whole
market
was
tied
up
this
way,
under
the
defendants'
theory
despite
their
complete
tie
up,
there
would
be
no
illegality
because
no
single
defendant
itself
would
have
had
market
dominance
over
the
entire
product
market.
we
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i'm
assuming
that
all
the
sellers
in
the
country,
not
only
these
six
defendants
but
all
sellers,
all
distributors,
90
of
them
or
whatever
number
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
really
a
hypo
--
but
it's
really
hypothetical
but
mr.
justice,
under
their
theory,
it
seems
to
us,
they
would
still
be
able
to
argue
no
single
one
has
dominance
over
the
entire
market,
therefore,
there
is
no
illegality.
we
believe
that
cannot
be
that
law
and
we
believe
that
is
not
the
law,
and
we
believe
that
these
contracts
are
illegal
and
that
in
the
circumstances,
first,
the
district
court
properly
found
them
illegal,
second
that
the
district
court
properly
did
grant
injunctive
relief,
and
third,
that
the
modifications,
we
suggest,
are
necessary
to
make
the
relief
effective
in
this.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
record
doesn't
show
copyrighters
for
28
years
and
it's
extended
for
another
28.
i
think
these
films
began
around
1929
and
1930
but
they
may
have
extended
their
copyright.
i
just
don't
know
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
district
court
so
found
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
district
court
expressly
so
found
and
of
course
the
more
desirable
film
which
the
tie-in
films
presumably
are
the
more
recent
films
and
i
think
it's
the
reasonable
assumption
that
as
to
them
at
least,
the
copyright
is
still
extended.
thank
you.
