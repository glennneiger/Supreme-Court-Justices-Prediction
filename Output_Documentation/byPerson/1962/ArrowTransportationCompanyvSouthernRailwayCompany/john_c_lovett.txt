mr.
john
c.
lovett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
this
case
is
before
this
court
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
thank
you,
sir.
i
was
waiting
for
the
chart
if
the
court
please.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
fifth
circuit.
i
have
agreed
with
the
government's
counsel
on
the
division
of
the
argument
in
order
to
avoid
any
unnecessary
duplication.
i
will
present
the
factual
picture,
the
history
of
the
case
and
if
time
permits,
i
will
briefly
summarize
our
legal
position
and
the
government's
counsel
will
present
the
legal
position
in
detail,
the
statutory
history,
and
the
statutory
policies
involved.
the
issue
before
this
court
is
both
narrow
and
simple.
briefly
stated,
that
issue
is
whether
the
federal
district
court
has
the
power
to
prevent
serious
irreparable
injury
to
competing
carriers
and
to
shippers,
and
the
localities
by
putting
into
effect
certain
drastic
rate
reductions
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
declared
prima
facie
unlawful
and
in
a
situation
where
the
interstate
commerce
commission
where
its
power
to
prevent
these
rates
from
going
into
the
effect
has
been
invoked
and
spent.
to
put
the
issue
in
perspective,
let
me
present
a
brief
background.
we
have
attached
a
chart
to
our
brief
as
appendix
b,
and
it
tells
most
of
the
story.
i've
had
it
enlarged
here
for
purposes
of
illustration.
in
the
upper
left
hand
corner
of
the
chart
is
the
breadbasket
of
america.
this
is
the
great
grain
surplus
producing
area.
in
the
southeastern
part,
in
the
lower
right
hand
corner,
the
southeastern
part
of
the
united
states
we
have
the
great
grain
deficit
area
today
and
today,
grain
moves
in
tremendous
volumes
from
the
surplus
area
to
the
deficit
area.
it
was
not
always
so.
the
tennessee
river
in
its
natural
state,
where
the
series
of
(inaudible)
and
rapids,
and
was
not
completely
navigable
and
the
rail
rates
which
were
then
in
effect
from
the
midwest
to
the
southeast
were
prohibitively
high.
consequently
there
was
no
major
grain
industry
that
developed
in
these
southeastern
states.
after
the
tennessee
valley
authority
constructed
a
series
of
dams
on
the
tennessee
river,
the
river
became
navigable
the
year
around
and
it
furnished
it
and
its
connecting
waterways,
furnished
a
natural,
logical
low
cost
route
for
grain
to
move
from
the
surplus
area
to
the
deficit
area.
a
large
poultry
industry
developed
in
the
southeastern
states,
particularly
in
alabama
and
georgia,
and
the
low
cost
water
movement
made
this
development
possible.
a
number
of
elevators,
feed
mills
and
so
forth
were
constructed
at
the
tennessee
river
ports.
the
grain
would
move
by
barge
through
or
from
st.
louis
up
to
tennessee
river
to
such
ports
as
guntersville,
which
was
the
major
one
where
the
development
occurred
because
it
was
the
southernmost
point
on
the
tennessee
river.
the
result
was
that
the
demand
for
grain
in
the
southeast
skyrocketed.
now
this
was
a
tremendous
new
movement
of
grain.
the
movement
by
barge
to
the
tennessee
river
ports,
such
as
guntersville
then
transshipped
from
guntersville
and
the
other
ports
to
interior
destinations
in
the
southeast,
where
the
grain
was
consumed,
used
to
feed
the
poultry,
and
for
the
other
feed
purposes.
very
little
of
this
grain
is
actually
consumed
at
the
river
ports
themselves.
over
80%
of
the
grain
which
moves
on
the
tennessee
river
is
later
transshipped
to
interior
destinations,
either
by
barge
--
by
a
trip
or
by
rail
and
either
as
grain
or
as
grain
products.
the
high
rail
reshipping
charges
from
the
tennessee
river
ports
to
the
interior
destinations
impeded
the
barge-rail
movement
of
grain
into
the
southeast,
and
the
railroads
persisted
in
the
refusal
to
publish
usable
rail
rates
on
the
barge
grain
which
arrived
at
the
tennessee
river
ports.
these
reshipping
rates
after
nine
years
of
litigation
in
the
commission
and
in
the
courts
were
declared
unlawful
in
arrow
transportation
company
against
the
united
states
which
this
court
affirmed
per
curiam
in
1960.
meanwhile,
the
barge-truck
movement
of
grain
in
by
barge,
out
by
truck
constantly
increased.
then
in
july
of
1961,
about
a
year
after
this
decision
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
the
resh
--
the
rail
reshipping
rates
from
the
tennessee
river
ports
to
the
interior
destinations.
the
situation
was
that
the
railroads
were
charging
two
levels
of
rates
here.
they
had
a
high
level
of
rates
which
applied
if
the
grain
came
to
these
ports
by
water
and
the
low
level
of
rates
outbound
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
--
that
came
by
rail
and
this
was
declared
unlawful.
and
in
19
--
in
july
of
1961,
about
a
year
after
the
arrow
decision,
the
southern
railway
company
acting
independently
and
without
any
prior
consultation
with
shippers
or
other
rail
carriers
published
the
rates
which
are
involved
here.
it
proposed
to
reduce
the
all-rail
rate
from
the
ohio
and
mississippi
river
ports
to
specified
destinations
in
the
southeast.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
in
july
of
1961,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
it
has
completed
the
hearings.
it
has
not
yet
reached
a
decision.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
the
hearings
were
concluded
in
--
on
a
date,
august
the
29th
of
last
year.
the
briefs
were
filed
on
november
the
5th
and
there
has
been
no
action
since
that
time.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
sir.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
sir
and
i
was
explaining
that
right
here.
after
--
about
two
weeks
after
the
southern
railway
published
these
rates,
the
other
railroads
who
operate
in
the
southeastern
states
published
the
same
rates
to
apply
on
their
lines.
now,
this
was
done
by
them
as
a
defensive
measure,
so
as
to
prevent
the
loss
of
their
traffic
and
their
shippers
to
the
southern.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
sir.
the
southern's
petition
to
separate
it
was
denied
by
the
commission.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
all
of
the
carriers,
yes
sir.
this
publication
of
these
rates
created
a
storm
of
protest.
petitions
to
suspend
were
filed
by
barge
lines,
grain
dealers,
elevator
operators,
tennessee
valley
authority
and
many
others
and
the
rate
exhibits
were
submitted
and
cost
data
were
submitted.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
the
tennessee
valley
authority
is
statutorily
responsible
for
developing
the
tennessee
river
and
its
tributaries
and
the
areas
surrounding
it.
now,
they
have
done
that
and
they
take
the
position
that
if
these
rates
go
into
effect
it
will
convert
the
tennessee
river
from
an
important
artery
of
commerce
into
just
a
recreational
area.
it
will
kill
the
barge
service
on
the
tennessee
river.
of
these
petitions
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
the
grain
dealers
--
those
who
are
geared
to
the
low
cost
water
movement
are
the
ones
who
primarily
object.
the
ones
who
were
geared
to
all
rail
movement
support
these
rates
because
they're
going
to
inherit
the
business
that
the
others
lose.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes.
that's
correct,
sir.
now
there
are
a
number
of
other
issues
involving
these
rates
which
i
will
discuss
in
just
a
minute
but
this
is
one
of
them,
this
damage
to
the
water
transportation
of
water
movement.
well,
the
commission
suspended
the
rates
for
seven
months
from
august
the
8th,
1961.
southern
twice
asked
that
this
be
vacated
and
each
time
it
was
refused
which
means
that
the
commission
has
had
three
looks
at
this
suspension
and
after
these
three
looks,
the
commission
as
adhered
to
its
original
finding
which
was,
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
these
rates
will
be
unjust
and
unreasonable
in
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
and
will
constitute
unfair
and
destructive,
competitive
practices
in
violation
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
now
thereafter,
the
southern
twice
asked
that
the
hearings
in
the
suspension
proceeding
be
sus
--
be
postponed
and
it
voluntarily
extended
the
suspension
period
by
a
corresponding
length
of
time.
after
this
was
done,
the
end
of
this
suspension
period
became
august
the
7th
of
1962
and
the
hearings
before
the
commission
began
on
january
the
8th
of
1962.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
the
seven
months
from
august
the
7th,
1961.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
the
southern
extended
it
because
it
requested
delays
in
the
hearings
before
the
commission
and
they
extended
it
for
a
corresponding
time.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
at
one
time
their
counsel
became
ill
and
it
was
necessarily
that
they
terminate
the
hearings
for
30
days.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
almost
exactly
12
months.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
that's
right.
this
involved
the
full
exercise
of
the
commission's
powers
in
the
voluntary
suspension
by
the
southern
for
five
months.
well,
the
hearings
began
on
january
the
8th,
1962
and
were
not
concluded
until
the
end
of
august
of
1962
which
would
have
been
--
which
was
in
three
weeks
after
the
suspension
period
expired.
now,
our
motion
which
we
made
in
march
to
the
commission,
that
the
commission
order
these
rates
canceled
as
unlawful
on
their
face
were
denied
by
the
commission
on
the
ground
that
the
commission
lacked
the
jurisdiction
to
consider
this
relief
until
after
a
full
hearing
as
provided
in
section
15
(7).
in
july
of
last
year,
it
became
apparent
to
us
that
the
commission
could
not
possibly
act
prior
to
the
expiration
of
the
suspension
period
on
august
the
7th.
we
had
asked
the
railroads
voluntarily
to
extend
the
suspension
period
again
in
order
to
permit
the
commission
to
reach
a
decision
in
an
orderly
way,
absent
any
atmosphere
of
prices.
all
of
the
other
railroads
agreed
to
do
this
provided
that
southern
would
agree
and
the
southern
refused,
although
this
is
customary
in
cases
where
the
issues
are
complicated
as
this
one.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
we
then
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
pardon?
mr.
john
c.
lovett
this
shipping
sir
is
practically
the
year
around.
it's
a
very
constant
movement.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
no
sir,
not
particularly.
now,
there
is
a
slight
variation
when
the
grain
in
the
southeast
is
harvested.
sometimes
this
slows
down
the
movement
of
grain
but
very
little.
we
then
were
faced
with
an
emergency
situation.
we
knew
that
if
these
rates
went
into
effect
on
august
the
7th,
months
would
elapse
before
these
rates
could
be
ordered
canceled
by
a
final
order.
we
also
knew
that
we
simply
could
not
survive
that
period
and
we
knew
that
the
commission
had
fully
exhausted
its
powers
to
help
us.
our
problem
was
one
that
was
unprecedented.
never
before
had
rates
been
published
which
were
so
drastically
reduced,
which
were
so
widespread
in
application,
which
were
so
immediately
destructive
by
a
carrier
so
determined
to
put
them
into
effect
whether
they
have
been
approved
or
not.
and
we
therefore
sought
the
aid
of
the
equity
court,
seeking
to
restrain
these
rates,
alleging
the
traditional
grounds
for
invoking
equities
jurisdiction
and
asserting
our
willingness
to
indemnify
the
railroads
by
bond
against
any
provable
damages
that
they
might
sustain
in
the
event
these
rates
should
later
be
declared
lawful.
we
asked
a
status
quo
injunction
which
would
require
the
railroads
to
be
content
with
the
rates
they
established
for
themselves
only
a
few
years
before,
or
the
temporary
period
until
the
commission
could
decide
this
case.
now
let
me
briefly
describe
these
rates.
these
are
multiple-car
rates
which
apply
only
to
those
grain
dealers,
grain
receivers
who
are
equipped
to
receive,
unload,
store
and
pay
for
a
minimum
of
450
tons
or
about
16,000
bushels
of
grain
at
one
time.
they
apply
--
they
have
a
$2.40
minimum
rate
and
this
minimum
rate
is
absolute
up
to
a
distance
of
346
miles.
now,
that
means
that
the
shipper
who
ships
10
miles
pays
the
same
rates
as
one
who
ships
346
miles
and
these
rates
do
not
apply
from
the
tennessee
river
ports
to
interior
destinations.
they
apply
only
from
the
ohio
and
mississippi
river
ports.
now
a
single
example
will
demonstrate
the
effect
of
these
rates.
and
i
have
(inaudible)
birmingham,
alabama,
that
one
--
it
is
a
major
grain
destination.
it
is
served
by
petitioner
o.j.
walls
with
barged
grain
which
he
receives
at
the
guntersville,
which
is
one
of
the
petitioners,
and
transships
by
rail
to
birmingham.
the
present
all-rail
rate
from
st.
louis
to
birmingham
is
$8.70
and
it
is
being
reduced
to
$3.12.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
that
is
applicable
to
any
quantity
and
i
might
add
that
this
is
the
lowest
applicable
rate.
this
is
what's
called
the
coarse
grain
scale.
now
the
rate
which
applies
to
wheat
for
example
is
over
$10
today,
but
it
will
likewise
be
reduced
to
$3.12
under
this
proposal.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
that's
correct.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
only
in
the
450
tons
or
more.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
this
would
be
five
of
the
jumbo
hopper
cars.
this
would
be
nine
of
the
ordinary
rail
box
cars
and
hopper
cars.
now,
the
rates
provide
also
that
if
they
ship
as
much
as
900
tons,
the
rate
goes
down
10
cents.
if
they
have
as
much
as
1800
tons
in
one
shipment
it
goes
down
another
10
cents.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
that's
practically
a
whole
train,
yes
sir.
that
would
be
--
well,
of
course
9
--
900
tons
would
be
about
32,000
bushels
of
grain.
you
can
see
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes
sir.
to
one
consignee,
shipped
in
one
shipment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
it's
both.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
both,
yes.
that's
to
go
from
one
shipper
to
one
consignee
in
that
volume.
the
barge
distance
from
st.
louis
to
guntersville
is
576
miles
and
the
rail
distance
from
guntersville
down
to
birmingham
is
71
miles.
now,
this
rate
down
to
birmingham
from
guntersville
of
$2.20
is
not
going
to
be
changed.
and
even
if
they
should
apply
this
new
scale
of
rates
to
the
tennessee
river
ports,
the
minimum
rate
would
make
this
rate
$2.40
instead
of
$2.20.
the
present
barge
rail
rate
is
$5.48.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
per
ton.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
per
ton,
these
are
rates
per
ton,
yes.
it's
easy
to
see
then
that
if
arrow
transportation
company
wishes
to
compete
on
this
barge
mo
--
on
this
movement
to
birmingham,
it
must
reduce
its
barge
rate
for
this
576
mile
haul
from
$2.39
a
ton
to
3
cents
per
ton.
this
is
the
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
and
the
transfer
charge
from
barge
to
rail
at
guntersville
plus
the
barge
markup
makes
up
the
$5.40.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
transfer
charge.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
sir.
some
of
it
--
you
asked
about
the
trucking
rates.
now
some
of
the
trucking
rates
are
--
most
of
these
trucking
rates
are
not.
incidentally,
since
you
brought
that
up,
the
trucking
rate
from
guntersville
to
birmingham
although
there's
not
much
grain
truck
to
birmingham
because
the
receivers
there
are
big
grain
companies
but
the
trucking
rate
is
$1.79.
now
the
barge
trip
haul
to
remain
competitive
would
require
that
this
rate,
the
barge
rate
be
reduced
to
44
cents
a
ton.
to
most
of
the
destinations
in
the
southeast,
arrow
transportation
company
could
not
remain
competitive
if
it
performs
a
barge
leg
of
this
service
without
any
charge
whatsoever.
the
rates
which
would
inflict
more
immediate
and
more
lethal
injury
on
the
water
carriers
and
on
the
shippers
and
the
port
cities
can
scarcely
be
imagined.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
no,
sir,
not
at
all.
so
long
as
the
competition
is
fair
and
is
lawful
under
the
act.
now
this
is
the
issue
of
course
which
is
pending
before
the
commission.
i
use
this
for
an
illustration
simply
for
the
purpose
of
showing
the
source
of
the
irreparable
injury
which
we
claim.
and
it
is
not
surprising
then
that
arrow
which
is
the
largest
certificated
common
carrier
by
water
on
the
tennessee
river
would
lose
all
of
its
grain
traffic
under
this
rate
set
up,
would
lose
80%
of
its
revenues
and
could
not
survive
on
the
other
20%,
and
would
have
to
surrender
its
charter,
a
certificate
and
liquidate
its
assets
and
all
in
the
matter
of
six
months.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
sir.
the
other
commodities
it
carries
furnishes
20%
of
its
total
revenues,
grain
furnishes
80%.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
i
would
not
say
so,
no
sir.
now
arrow
as
i
say
is
the
largest
certificated
common
carrier.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
there
are
others
operating
on
the
tennessee
river
whose
proportion
of
traffic
is
not
quite
so
high
in
terms
of
grain,
but
arrow
is
the
petitioner
here
who's
--
who
is
going
to
be
destroyed
in
a
short
period
of
time.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
a
great
more
--
yes.
most
of
it
does.
in
fact,
down
in
the
alabama
and
georgia
they
have
a
broiler
industry
which
produces
hundreds
of
millions
of
broilers
per
year.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
as
i
interpret
your
question,
it
has
two
parts.
first,
is
our
position
predicated
on
the
fact
that
these
rates
are
unlawful?
no,
that
isn't
our
position.
our
position
is
that
this
is
for
the
primary
and
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
to
determine
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates.
they
have
indicated
a
preliminary
belief
that
these
rates
are
prima
facie
on
lawful,
but
there's
still
pondering
the
question
of
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates.
your
second
question
is
if
these
rates
should
ultimately
be
declared
unlawful,
would
we
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
law?
in
my
opinion
sir,
we
certainly
would
not.
in
the
first
place
there
has
never
been
a
recorded
case
and
the
court
below
cited
none
and
neither
the
southern
cited
one
where
this
remedy
provided
by
section
8
is
available.
in
second
the
place,
you'd
have
an
impossible
question
of
problem
of
proof,
not
the
proof
of
your
damages,
but
proving
the
identity
of
the
carrier
who
caused
it.
you
have
lost
your
traffic
which
carrier
took
what
part
of
the
traffic
you
lost,
this
i
think
would
be
an
inadequate
remedy
and
finally
if
we
were
already
in
bankruptcy,
a
future
action
at
law
would
be
of
no
help
to
us.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
no,
sir.
they
filed
no
bonds.
these
rates
of
course
have
not
gone
into
effect.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
they
have
been
they
have
been
restricted.
but
they
are
not
required
to
file
any
bonds,
no.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
no,
sir.
the
right
of
the
commission
to
suspend
these
rates
is
an
absolute
right
to
do
it
summarily
without
requiring
any
security,
without
balancing
the
equities,
without
any
showing
of
irreparable
injury
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
for
seven
months
only,
that's
correct.
this
is
the
difference
between
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
that
would
be
correct
unless
the
equity
in
this
extreme
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
sir.
in
this
extreme
case
the
court
can
adjourn.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes
sir,
it
does.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
it's
a
--
it
--
well,
it's
peculiar
to
this
petitioner
on
the
tennessee
river.
this
is
a
--
just
another
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
tennessee
river
bank
traffic,
but
it
does
apply
to
other
sections
of
the
country.
for
example,
in
this
--
in
the
pacific
inland
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
i
think
it's
on
page
29,
you
had
a
situation
where
the
grain
traffic
was
not
actually
involved,
but
you
had
petroleum
rates
were
involved.
now
the
petroleum
rates
were
reduced
in
an
order
to
capture
the
upstream
traffic
of
petroleum
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
--
because
the
grain
was
coming
downstream.
you
see
they
lose
the
back
haul.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
sir.
now
this,
this
destruction
to
us
would
come
about
so
quickly
within
six
months
and
southern
knew
this,
just
as
long
as
we
do.
the
district
court
knew
it,
and
the
district
court
strongly
recommended
that
the
southern
voluntarily
extend
this
period
for
a
short
time
in
order
that
the
commission
might
pass
upon
it.
southern
again
refused,
referring
to
--
it
inflicted
its
damage
first
and
then
discussed
later
the
lawfulness
of
the
means
used.
now
the
district
court
made
every
necessary
finding
for
the
issuance
of
the
status
quo
injunction,
save
one;
this
one
was
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
he
even
went
further
and
balanced
the
equities
between
the
parties
and
said
that
the
ends
of
justice
is
in
his
opinion
would
best
be
served
if
this
temporary
injunctive
relief
were
granted,
but
lacking
jurisdiction
he
found
himself
powerless
to
act.
now
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
ground
that
section
15
(7)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
authorized
the
commission
to
suspend
rates
in
the
first
instance
as
impliedly
ousted
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
district
court
to
exercise
its
ancillary
jurisdiction
in
this
matter.
now
i
will
only
briefly
summarize
our
legal
position.
we
think
the
legal
question
can
be
broken
down
into
two
parts.
first,
does
the
district
court
have
the
inherent
power
to
exercise
ancillary
jurisdiction
to
preserve
the
status
of
parties
in
a
proceeding
before
another
agency
where
that
agency
itself
is
powerless
to
act
and
where
the
preservation
of
the
status
is
essential
in
order
to
permit
that
agency
to
make
a
decision
which
will
be
effective
and
not
obligatory.
now,
this
question
has
been
discussed
in
our
brief
at
great
length
and
we
think
clearly
that
the
federal
district
courts
have
this
inherent
equity
power.
the
more
crucial
question
however,
is
whether
congress
in
enacting
section
15
(7)
has
impliedly
taken
this
power
away.
the
argument
that
congress
has
impliedly
withdrawn
this
power
it
seems
to
me
to
rest
upon
a
misapplication
of
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine.
here
there
is
no
potential
conflict
between
the
agency
and
the
court.
the
court
can
do
nothing
which
will
either
duplicate
or
anticipate
or
interfere
with
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
commission
to
decide
the
lawfulness
and
to
carry
out
its
statutory
powers.
the
commission
has
found
these
rates
to
be
presumptively
unlawful.
the
district
court
did
not
find
them
to
be
unlawful.
he
merely
accepted
the
commission's
decision
on
this
point.
the
district
court
did
not
change
it.
judicial
intervention
here,
far
from
making
the
commissions'
task
more
difficult,
actually
enables
the
commission
to
make
an
effective
decision,
one
that
will
be
a
more
than
a
mere
academic
interest
to
my
clients.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
the
case
is
still
before
the
commission,
as
i
said,
the
briefs
have
been
filed
and
we
frankly
anticipate
a
decision
from
the
commission
quite
quickly.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
the
commission
has
worked
hard
on
this
case.
this
is
a
very
complicated
case,
sir.
there
are
about
16,000
pages
of
transcript
and
about
575
exhibits
and
i
think
the
commission
has
had
several
examiners
working
on
this
case
and
i'm
sure,
confident
in
my
own
mind
that
the
commission
is
doing
everything
in
its
power
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
--
to
resolve
these
issues.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
a
stage
will
be
a
deport
--
a
report
by
division
2.
we
have
asked
for
the
initial
reports
by
the
full
commission
and
thus
far
this
has
been
denied,
although
we
have
asked
for
reconsideration.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
there
may
well
be.
it
would
of
course
depend
on
what
these
reports
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
it
could
take
quite
a
while,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
there
are
more
provisions
for
the
rehearing,
yes
and
the
act
reads
of
course
that
you
cannot
go
into
court
for
review
until
the
petition
for
rehearing
has
been
disposed
off.
there
has
been
one
or
two
cases
which
said
that
this
is
not
invariably
true,
but
they
conceivably
could
last
for
several
more
months.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes
sir,
on
august
the
29th.
i
believe
it
was.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
no
sir,
the
briefs
have
been
filed.
well,
we
have
heard
this,
the
southern
asked
the
commission
to
first
set
the
matter
for
oral
argument.
and
second,
asked
the
commission
to
have
the
initial
decision
by
the
full
commission.
now
this
motion
was
denied
as
to
the
oral
argument
before
the
commission
and
it
was
also
denied
as
to
the
initial
decision
by
the
full
commission.
we
then
asked
the
commission
to
reconsider
this
decision
which
is
in
do
far
as
it
applies
to
the
initial
decision.
we
did
not
want
oral
argument.
we
didn't
think
it
would
be
helpful
when
you
had
16,000
pages
of
transcript
but
we
did.
we
would
like
to
have
the
initial
decision
by
the
full
commission.
now
this
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes
sir
and
our
motion
has
not
been
passed
upon.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
yes,
sir.
if
the
decision
is
a
reviewable
one,
if
it
is
ripe
for
review
by
the
federal
district
court
or
the
three-judge
court
then
that
court
has
jurisdiction
to
enter
in
a
temporary
restraining
orders
to
preserve
the
status
[inaudible]
mr.
john
c.
lovett
if
it
is
a
final
order.
now,
if
they
put
--
there's
a
conflict
in
the
statute
here.
if
the
order
of
the
commission
is
under
reconsideration,
the
act
says
that
you
cannot
go
into
court,
one
part
of
act
says
that.
another
part
says
that
if
you
--
well,
the
pacific
inland
case
and
the
cantlay
case,
both
said
that
if
you
have
an
order
of
the
commission
then
you
can
seek
review
of
that
order
by
the
three-judge
court,
yes.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
they
got
around
the
order
--
there
had
been
a
final
decision
by
the
commission
in
the
arrow
case.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
well,
that's
correct.
you
see,
in
the
arrow
case
the
three-judge
court
in
effect
told
the
commission
that
if
you
don't
change
this,
we're
going
to
change
it
for
you
and
they
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
the
commission
said,
if
you
don't
--
the
commission
had
entered
an
opinion
in
the
arrow
case.
this
was
taken
to
the
three-judge
court
in
alabama.
the
commission
asked
the
three-judge
court
not
to
pass
on
that
until
they
could
reconsider
it
in
light
of
the
--
this
court's
decision
in
the
dixie
carrier's
case.
and
then
there
was
another
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
--
opinion
by
the
commission
which
went
to
the
court
up
in
kansas,
you
may
recall
the
atchison,
topeka
and
santa
fe.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
this
sir,
incidentally
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
that
--
that's
right.
as
i
recall
that
was
in
march.
they
said
you'd
--
we'll
hold
it
up
until
march.
and
if
you
don't
pass
on
it
by
that
time
we
will
in
effect
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
that's
correct.
that
was
a
three-judge
court
in
alabama.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
--
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
argument
concerning
the
question
whether
technological
developments
have
made
barge
movement
of
grain
obsolete.
these
are
questions
of
course
which
are
pending
before
the
commission.
these
go
into
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates,
but
may
i
quickly
summarize
the
rest
of
our
legal
position.
we
do
not
believe
as
evidently
did
the
court
below
that
we
can
take
the
literal
language
of
the
statute,
the
word
shall
go
into
effect
and
apply
the
plain
meaning
rule
and
get
the
answer
to
this
case.
surely,
the
words
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
i
think
the
--
oh
--
mr.
john
c.
lovett
no
sir.
i
think
the
district
court
has
an
obligation
to
weigh
the
equities
when
this
thing
is
presented
to
it
and
if
the
railroads
take
that
position,
i
think
the
district
court
has
to
look
at
it,
yes.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
you.
i
can
conceive
of
a
situation
where
if
the
suspension
powers
are
not
invoked,
the
court
can
forcibly
invoke
it.
i
think
it's
very
difficult
or
if
they
are
invoked,
the
courts
can
intervene.
if
the
invoking
of
the
suspension
powers
where
it
results
in
the
railroads
being
required
to
collect
a
rate
which
is
confiscatory
or
extortion,
i
certainly
think
the
courts
can
intervene
in
that
case,
yes.
mr.
john
c.
lovett
my
own
feeling
is
that
it
would,
that
there
are
situations
where
nothing
will
prevent
a
person
having
access
to
the
court.
if
they
can
show
that
this
is
confiscatory
and
unconstitutional
deprivation
of
their
property,
i
would
have
no
doubt
of
it,
sir.
