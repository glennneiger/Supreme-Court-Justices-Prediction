mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
was
not
a
party
to
this
litigation
in
the
lower
courts.
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
a
brief
here
at
the
invitation
of
this
court
and
we
there
suggest
that
there
is
no
absolute
bar,
jurisdictional
or
statutory,
to
the
relief
which
petitioners
are
seeking.
we
also
suggest
the
petitioners
have
perhaps
an
unusually
heavy
burden
in
order
to
show
that
equity
ought
to
intervene.
let
me
also
note
at
the
outset
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
a
different
view
of
the
matter
and
is
of
the
opinion
as
are
the
respondents
here,
the
rail
carriers,
that
the
courts
are
without
jurisdiction
until
the
commission
has
entered
a
final
order
in
the
administrative
procedure.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
has
not.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
its
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
that
may
well
be,
i
should
add
that
there
has
been
no
--
there
would've
been
certainly
no
attempt
to
impede
the
commission
from
making
a
fuller
statement
of
its
views
and
it
was
content
to
state
the
conclusion
which
appears
at
the
beginning
of
the
government's
brief.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
are
one
or
two
commission
opinions
in
which
their
dicta
on
this
matter
--
yes.
the
proposition
with
which
we
begin
as
do
petitioners
is
that
it
is
a
traditional
function
of
equity,
one
which
is
certainly
been
performed
for
many
years
in
anglo-american
history.
to
intervene
in
order
to
protect
a
situation
from
a
drastic
change
while
another
proceeding
is
pending
elsewhere,
the
early
common
laws
of
course,
the
other
proceeding
was
ordinarily
an
action
in
the
lower
courts
or
perhaps
from
the
ecclesiastical
courts.
but
in
more
recent
times
one
finds
more
than
a
fair
sprinkling
of
cases
in
which
the
other
proceeding
is
one
awaiting
adjudication
before
an
administrative
tribunal.
certainly
all
things
being
equal,
equity
may
intervene
in
the
latter
situation
no
less
than
in
the
former
and
a
line
of
cases
involving
the
maritime
commission
most
sharply
illustrates
the
practice
which
has
grown
up.
that
commission
has
no
apparent
authority
at
all
to
issue
an
injunction
or
a
stay
order
or
a
suspension
order
while
it
is
investigating
the
legality
of
the
disputed
[inaudible]
statutes.
but
the
courts
have,
several
courts
of
appeals
of
several
circuits
have
agreed
i
think
without
exception,
that
equity
may
step
into
the
breach
when
necessary
and
preserve
the
status
quo
during
the
tendency
of
the
commission
proceeding.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
there
are
two
parts
to
my
argument.
the
first
part
is
an
attempt
to
canvass
briefly
the
inherent
powers
of
the
court
of
equity
in
situations
of
the
type
which
are
presented
here.
the
second
part
will
necessarily
have
to
take
into
account
the
particular
statutory
scheme
with
which
we're
dealing
and
the
statutory
history
in
order
to
ascertain
whether
exercise
of
this
general
equity
power
would
be
consistent
with
the
--
with
what
might
be
called
the
equity
of
the
statute,
the
policy
that
congress
has
to
plan
and
i
would
therefore
say
in
relation
to
the
mediation
question
which
your
--
your
honor
presented
that
that
would
certainly
turn
on
consideration
peculiar
to
the
statutory
structure
of
the
acts
which
are
there
relevant
just
as
this
case
is
doing
the
turn
ultimately
i
suspect
on
analysis
of
the
scheme
of
section
15
(7)
and
the
history
of
that
section.
i
was
going
to
suggest
in
relation
to
the
general
equity
power
that
the
court
may
recall
the
isbrandsten
case,
a
maritime
commission
case
which
was
here
in
the
1957
term.
that
involved
the
question
whether
an
association
or
conference
of
water
carriers
could
adapt
the
so-called
the
dual
rate
system,
a
system
whereby
shippers
paid
rates
at
one
level
if
they
signed
an
exclusive
patronage
contract
with
the
conference
of
water
carriers,
but
had
to
pay
rates
at
a
much
higher
level
to
all
members
of
the
conference
with
whom
they
place
shipments,
if
they
fail
to
sign
that
exclusive
agreement.
isbrandsten,
a
lonely,
independent
in
the
ocean
trade
that
was
involved
in
that
case,
challenged
the
practice
and
ultimately
prevailed
here.
what
maybe
forgotten
is
that
back
in
1948,
almost
a
decade
earlier,
isbrandsten
had
first
questioned
that
system
by
a
suit
in
the
district
court
which
sought
a
temporary
injunction
to
restrain
the
conference
lines
from
putting
it
into
operation.
the
injunction
was
granted
in
that
case
on
isbrandsten's
representations
that
it
could
not
long
survive
if
it
had
to
await
the
prospect
of
securing
relief
from
the
commission.
and
judge
rifkind's
opinion
in
that
case
stated,
i'm
going
to
quote
a
line
or
two
because
it
had
some
pertinence
here,
“where
the
defendant
carriers
to
institute
their
exclusive
patronage
system
pending
the
commission's
decision
in
a
complaint
proceeding,
the
plaintiff
would
be
gravely
prejudiced
since
the
commission
disclaims
the
power
to
afford
temporary
relief
and
the
equitable
power
of
the
court
to
preserve
the
status
quo
has
not
been
withdrawn
by
statute,
an
injunction
as
prayed
should
issue
conditioned
on
the
plaintiff
diligent
prosecution
before
the
commission.
are
their
complaints
challenging
the
validity
of
the
agreements?”
now,
that
passage
i
think
brings
us
to
the
next
question
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that's
recorded
in
81
f.
supp.,
your
honor
of
the
passage
i
read
at
546.
i
say
that
that
leads
to
the
next
question
which
is
whether
as
the
rail
carriers
in
this
case
argue,
the
interstate
commerce
act
did
withdraw
comprehensively
as
they
say
and
without
any
possibility
of
exception,
the
inherent
equitable
power
to
grant
relief
pending
the
completion
of
the
administrative
proceeding.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
--
i
do
not
think
so.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
--
i
think
the
policy
of
congress
in
--
expressed
in
the
statute
which
--
would
be
one
which
this
court
would
certainly
be
obliged
to
regard.
i
think
the
standard
involved
here
is
perhaps
similar
to
that
in
the
recent
view
with
robin's
case.
and
i
think
the
court
has
stated
in
that
case
that
a
judicial
remedy
may
coexist,
may
coexist
with
a
comprehensive
regulatory
scheme
when
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
remedy
supports
the
act's
overall
purposes
and
i
think
the
court's
language
was
--
is
and
is
in
nowise
inconsistent
with
the
congressional
scheme.
if
the
scheme
here
was
inconsistent
i
would
assume
that
the
court
would
have
stay
its
hand.
now,
southern
argues
in
--
well,
it
relies
on
section
15
(7)
which
defines
the
commission's
powers
to
suspend
the
rates.
and
that
section
provides
in
the
substance
as
your
honors
know
that
when
a
carrier
files
a
new
or
changed
the
rates,
the
commission
may
upon
a
written
statement
of
its
reasons
suspend
them
for
a
period,
i
will
now
talk
about
this,
i
will
mention
the
period
in
the
statute
that
now
stands,
for
period
not
to
exceed
seven
months,
that
period
has
changed
a
several
times
during
the
history
of
the
act.
if
the
administrative
proceeding
has
not
then
been
concluded,
the
provision
continues,
the
rates
shall
go
into
effect.
the
succeeding
sentence
of
section
15
(7)
goes
on
to
authorize
the
commission
to
require
the
carrier
to
keep
detailed
accounts
of
all
moneys
collected
under
the
new
rate
schedule
and
the
section
then
concludes
with
the
direction
to
the
commission
to
decide
these
cases
as
early
as
possible.
now
southern
regards
the
words,
“shall
go
into
effect,”
as
working
a
complete
ouster
of
federal
court
jurisdiction.
the
hitch
in
that
argument
as
we
view
it
is
that
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
section
which
in
its
entirety
is
seeking
to
define
the
powers
of
the
commission.
it
does
not
in
terms
address
itself
at
any
point
to
the
question,
what
if
any
powers
may
exist
outside
the
commission.
this
is
not
a
statute
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
would
depend
i
think
on
initial
determination
as
to
whether
there
was
a
legally
protected
interest
being
asserted
by
the
particular
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
contestant
or
plaintiff.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
comment
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
well,
i
think
there's
no
dispute
but
under
the
statute,
there
is
a
legally
protected
interest
in
water
carriers
to
realize
whatever
inherent
cost
advantages
they
may
have.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
in
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
interest
of
the
water
carriers
depends
upon
the
statute.
that
does
not
the
answer
i
would
submit,
the
question
whether
the
statute
that
precludes
any
ancillary
judicial
relief
which
will
serve
to
make
the
agency's
statutory
role
an
effective
one.
in
--
it
may
be,
i
suppose
it
would
be
that
so
far
as
the
competing
water
carrier
is
concerned
it
would
have
not
had
standing
at
common
law
to
be
free
from
competition,
maybe
quite
different
as
to
the
shipper
or
as
to
shippers
or
other
party.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
i
was
about
to
state
that
this
is
not
a
statute,
which
like
many
federal
statutes
in
one
form
or
work
--
of
words
or
another,
says
that
the
remedy
provided
in
the
section
shall
be
exclusive
for
the
sole
relief
and
remedy
shall
be
provided
by
the
act.
on
the
contrary,
this
is
an
act
which
has
a
different
philosophy
expressed
in
section
22
which
states
that
the
remedies
provided
by
the
act
shall
not
bridge
or
alter
any
remedies
which
existed
at
common
law.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
to
which
--
to
suspend,
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
agree
--
agree
with
you.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
essential
problem
as
we
view
it
is
not
one
of
jurisdiction
in
any
strict
sense,
but
rather
one
of
accommodation.
assuming
as
we
do
the
inherent
powers
of
an
equity
court
in
situations
of
the
type
here
presented,
the
power
to
preserve
legally
protected
interests
during
the
pendency
of
an
administrative
proceeding,
one
must
ask
the
question
to
what
extent
is
this
power
limited
or
qualified
by
policies
which
have
been
determined
by
congress,
that
is
to
say
implicit
in
the
statutory
scheme
or
in
the
legislative
history.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
respondent's
view
certainly
that
the
court
must
show
a
fair
regard
for
that
statutory
scheme
and
respect
those
congressional
policies
which
may
be
discerned.
let
me
go
back
to
1910
and
consider
the
situation
as
it
then
existed,
1910
of
course
being
the
year
that
the
mann-elkins
act
accorded
suspension
powers
to
the
commission.
southern's
brief
states
quite
accurately
at
page
19
and
i
quote
it,
“that
the
commission
was
empowered
to
act
only
upon
complaint
and
as
to
a
rate
that
was
then
in
effect.”
they
are
speaking
there
of
the
pre-1910
situation,
this
matter
of
course
that
any
relief
from
possibly
disastrous
consequences
pending
a
commission
determination
of
the
legality
of
the
rate
had
to
come
from
the
courts.
there
was
however,
division
and
confusion
in
the
lower
federal
courts
as
to
how
they
should
proceed
and
as
the
interstate
commerce
act
then
stood
there
was
considerable
reason
for
this
uncertainty.
for
a
court
to
enjoin
a
rate
before
there
was
any
determination,
even
a
preliminary
one
by
the
commission
as
to
its
probable
unlawfulness
which
seemingly
involved
the
court
at
least
in
a
measure
in
the
rate
making
or
at
least
the
rate
judging
process.
and
some
of
the
lower
courts
feared
that
enjoining
a
rate
from
taking
effect
might
conflict
with
the
spirit
of
this
court's
early
abilene
decision
which
had
held
that
the
courts
could
not
grant
damages
to
shippers
who
had
allegedly
been
charged
unreasonable
rates
in
advance
of
an
agency
determination,
a
commission
determination
of
the
issue
of
reasonableness.
i
might
note
parenthetically
that
this
court
in
the
tift
case
in
1909,
that's
tift
against
southern
railway,
had
left
open
the
question
whether
the
grant
of
injunctive
relief
to
prevent
a
rate
from
taking
effect
might
be
distinguished
from
the
bringing
of
an
action
at
law
for
damages.
the
fear
of
possible
intrusion
on
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
apart,
there
was
a
second
apparent
impediment
in
the
pre-1910
period
to
a
grant
of
injunctive
relief
for
under
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
as
it
then
stood,
the
commission
could
take
action
only
in
a
--
in
relation
to
a
rate
which
was
currently
demanded,
charged
or
collected.
if
a
shipper
therefore
succeeded
in
securing
an
injunction
against
a
carrier's
putting
a
rate
into
effect,
the
consequence
seemingly
would
be
a
permanent
injunction
rather
than
mere
temporary
relief.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
court
prevented
the
rate
from
taking
effect
the
commission
which
has
the
ultimate
job
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
of
determining
the
legality
of
the
rates
might
have
been
its
timing
because
under
a
literal
language
--
under
the
literal
language
of
the
act
the
commission's
jurisdiction
wouldn't
attach.
it
wouldn't
have
any
power
to
take
any
action
until
the
rate
was
being
demanded,
charged
or
collected.
a
few
courts,
notwithstanding
these
problems,
did
grant
injunctive
relief
in
the
pre-1910
period
whereas
others
concluded
that
the
grant
of
injunctive
relief
would
interfere
with
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
it
was
in
this
posture
with
the
equity
decisions
of
the
day
in
a
highly
confused
state
that
the
shippers,
shippers
went
to
congress
with
a
request
that
the
commission
be
accorded
powers
to
grant
suspensions.
the
administration,
the
taft
administration
supported
this
idea
and
an
administration
measure
was
introduced,
though
it
proposed
merely
a
power
to
suspend
for
a
60-day
period.
the
shippers,
at
least
at
their
most
extreme,
sought
suspension
of
every
rate
and
suspension
for
an
unlimited
period;
that
is
until
the
administrative
proceeding
was
completed
however
long
that
might
be.
the
carriers
on
the
other
hand
understandably
wished
to
confine
the
suspension
power
if
it
were
granted
as
narrowly
as
possible
and
to
have
it
for
a
short
period.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
will
come
to
that
in
this
legislative
history,
your
honor.
there
was
at
one
point
an
amendment
which
would
have
had
that
as
one
of
several
consequences.
the
shippers
advanced
the
arguments
by
and
large
that
damages
represented
a
delayed
and
a
sometimes
inadequate
remedy.
the
carriers
took
the
position
that
to
the
extent
rates
were
held
up
or
delayed
that
they
would
suffer
a
loss
which
could
not
be
recouped,
that
loss
of
course
occurring
if
the
rates
ultimately
proved
lawful.
congress
ultimately
compromised.
as
the
debate
shaped
up
in
both
houses,
the
principal
controversy
became
one
between
the
advocates
of
a
limited
period
of
suspension
and
the
proponents
of
unlimited
suspension
and
as
i
say
a
bargain
was
reached.
congress
did
not
provide
either
for
an
unlimited
period
of
suspension
or
for
automatic
suspension
of
every
rate.
it
did
give
the
commission
discretion
and
it
did
extend
the
period
for
which
the
rates
might
be
suspended
from
60
days
which
was
the
original
proposal
to
ten
months.
most
congressmen
apparently
believed
and
this
was
repeatedly
stated
in
the
debates
that
this
ought
to
be
a
sufficient
period
within
which
to
complete
proceeding.
a
number
of
the
legislators
expressly
noted
that
they
opposed
unlimited
suspension
because
they
wished
to
put
some
pressure
on
the
commission
to
get
cases
out
of
the
way.
they
did
not
want
to
give
the
commission
carte
blanche
to
stay
the
rates
indefinitely,
a
possible
prejudice
as
to
carriers
but
to
make
every
effort
to
accelerate
the
disposition
of
these
cases.
now,
there
was
some
discussion,
it
was
not
extensive,
as
to
whether
equity
could
intervene
if
the
commission
failed
to
complete
its
task
during
the
suspension
period.
several
congressmen
said
that
there
would
be
equitable
power
and
several
others
said
equally
clearly
that
they
doubted
it.
i
suppose
the
statements
on
this
point
are
something
of
a
standoff.
there
is
certainly
no
consensus
on
the
point.
we
do
suggest,
however,
that
this
is
significant
that
neither
those
who
thought
there
was
power
nor
those
who
doubted
it
suggested
that
congress
should
take
away
or
preclude
the
exercise
that
any
power
that
equity
might
have.
i
think
the
only
fair
inference
one
can
draw
from
the
debates
on
this
point
is
that
congress
was
content
to
leave
this
question
in
the
lack
of
support.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
was
and
there
were
statements
both
ways.
some
said
congress
--
equity
of
course
can
intervene
to
prevent
irreparable
injury
and
some
referring
to
some
of
the
cases
which
are
denied
of
injunctive
relief
expressed
a
doubt
in
the
cases
itself.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
or
might
otherwise
have.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
doubts,
i
think
arose
largely
from
confusion
as
to
what
the
existing
case
law
was
then.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
the
rights
of
the
particular
complainants
here
may
well
depend
upon
their
being
an
interstate
commerce
act,
except
to
the
extent
that
they
are
making
some
relia
--
that
some
reliance
upon
a
claim
of
discrimination
which
has
been
--
which
was
recognized
in
the
early
common
law
pre-interstate
commerce
act
cases.
assuming
as
i
do
that
the
water
carriers'
rights
depend
--
their
legally
protectable
interest
depends
upon
the
interstate
commerce
act
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
that
to
me
does
not
answer
the
question
whether
there
is
any
equity
power
of
the
traditional
kind
to
grant
relief
ancillary
to
the
conduct
of
the
administrative
proceeding
in
order
to
enable
that
proceeding
to
reach
its
intended
destination
and
to
prevent
the
case
perhaps
from
becoming
moot
in
one
sense.
if
there's
the
public
interest,
as
i
take
it
there
is
and
the
preservation
of
any
medium
of
competition
which
enjoys
inherent
advantages
and
if
it
be
assumed
as
in
the
present
posture
of
the
case
one
must,
that
these
rates
might
destroy
certificated
water
carriers
which
have
an
inherent
advantage,
then
in
those
circumstances
i
would
--
they
have
the
view
that
the
court
acting
on
the
finding
of
the
commission
itself,
that
these
rates
appeared
to
or
at
least,
has
reason
to
believe
that
they're
unlawful.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
a
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
it
is
a
necessary
agency
determination
before
the
agency
has
the
power
to
stand
if
they
would
--
i
would
--
if
the
preliminary
finding
or
determination
to
be
sure.
but
it
avoids
any
possibility
of
there
being
a
conflict
or
interference
by
virtue
of
the
court
speaking
in
the
first
days
as
to
a
matter
to
which
the
commission
has
not
addressed
itself.
now,
southern
makes
the
point
and
this
brings
me
back
to
the
question
of
just
--
mr.
justice
douglas
a
few
moments
ago.
senator
la
follette
proposed
an
amendment
during
the
--
while
this
was
on
the
senate
floor
which
would
have
given
the
commerce
court
which
was
created
in
1910,
the
power
to
grant
the
kind
of
relief
that
petitioners
were
seeking
here
and
that
is
so.
but
senator
la
follette's
proposal
would
have
gone
much,
much
further.
it
would
have
authorized
the
commerce
court
to
duplicate
the
commission
to
review
the
commission's
exercise
of
its
suspension
power
and
what
if
suspension
even
when
the
commission
had
refused
to
suspend.
his
proposal
as
a
result
was
objected
to
on
the
ground
that
it
would
usurp
the
commission's
primary
jurisdiction
and
give
parties
the
right
to
litigate
before
the
commerce
court,
the
very
issues
which
were
simultaneously
pending
before
the
commission.
moreover,
in
opposing
this
proposal,
senators
burton
and
elkins,
the
latter
of
course
the
co-sponsor
of
this
measure
and
certainly
his
views
are
therefore
entitled
to
great
weight
here,
senators
burton
and
elkins
stated
that
the
power
to
invoke
the
court
of
equity
in
a
proper
case
was
already
available
and
hence
this
amendment
was
not
necessary.
pardon?
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
burton,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
not
--
not
mr.
justice
burton.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
recall,
your
honor.
senator
elkins'
statement
or
at
least
a
portion
of
it
is
quoted
in
our
brief
at
page
35.
i
can't
take
the
time
to
read
it.
your
honor's
will
note
that
he
stated
very
broadly
that
anyone
can
go
into
a
court
in
a
case
where
irreparable
injury
is
about
to
be
perpetrated
and
get
an
injunction.
senator
burton
to
whom
--
to
whom
i
just
referred
stated
that
--
we
quote
him
briefly
on
the
preceding
page.
that
senator
la
follette's
amendment
was
unnecessary
because
there
was
already
in
his
words
ample
opportunity
for
the
shipper
–
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'm
reading
on
page
34,
about
two
thirds,
3
to
4
to
the
way
down,
ample
opportunity
he
said
for
the
shipper
to
seek
relief
and
i
quote,
“both
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
general
courts
of
the
country.”
senator
heyburn
whom
we
also
quote
and
his
remarks
appear
on
our
brief
at
page
32
in
the
long
note
similarly
stated
that
under
the
statute,
the
shipper
may
still
go
into
court.
now,
there
were
as
i
have
stated
earlier,
statements
by
other
senators
and
congressmen,
that
they
doubted
that
there
was
equity
power.
summing
up
the
congressional
policy
as
we
view
it
was
this.
congress
recognized
certainly
that
there
were
certain
--
let
me
call
them
ordinary
hardships
to
be
anticipated
on
both
sides.
for
the
carriers,
suspension
meant
a
delay
in
the
loss
of
the
rates
ultimately
proved
to
be
lawful.
for
the
protestants,
a
failure
to
suspend
would
entail
if
the
rates
ultimately
proved
unlawful,
the
interim
burden
of
paying
higher
charges
and
the
possibility
that
damages
might
prove
incomplete.
a
shipper
for
example
presumably
would
be
able
to
collect
the
excess
payments
he
made
to
the
carrier
if
the
rates
proved
unlawful,
would
he
be
able
to
prove
consequential
damages,
such
as
lost
business
during
the
period
that
he
was
required
to
ship
goods
even
in
a
fixed
rate.
as
we
see
it,
congress
reached
a
compromise,
it
struck
a
balance
between
these
competing
considerations
to
which
it
referred.
this
ordinary
hardship
associated
with
having
rates
in
effect
during
an
interim
period
before
there
legality
is
finally
determined
would've
fall
upon
the
carriers
for
the
first
period,
it's
a
seven
months
period
if
the
statute
now
stands.
thereafter,
if
the
proceeding
were
not
completed,
those
burdens
would
be
shifted
to
the
shipper
or
to
the
competing
carriers
as
the
case
might
be.
we
don't
find
any
evidence
in
the
history
that
congress'
countenance,
the
prospect,
that
the
carriers
might
be
free
to
shift
a
burden
calculated
to
destroy
the
other
party
or
that
it
was
of
the
view
that
equity
should
be
precluded
in
such
extreme
circumstances
from
guarding
against
consequences
of
this
kind.
in
short
the
petitioners
here
were
alleging
simply
a
threatened
loss
of
profits,
not
the
threatened
extinction
of
the
business,
but
the
business
which
itself
is
affected
with
the
public
interest
and
operates
under
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity.
if
they
were
merely
claiming
possible
losses,
we
would
say
in
the
light
of
the
statutory
history
that
they
should
be
relegated
to
the
remedy
of
damages
under
section
8,
even
if
that
might
prove
less
than
100%
adequate.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
know
of
no
case.
i
think
that
is
what
we
--
you
expect
correct
but
no
case
in
which
a
competing
carrier
has
obtained
damages
before
the
--
i
know
of
no
case
in
which
a
competing
carrier
has
obtained
a
damage
award
or
reparations
award
before
the
commission.
that
does
not
imply
that
the
commission
has
held
that
that
remedy
is
unavailable.
i
don't
know
how
many
proceedings
had
been
brought
under
such
a
theory.
there
appeared
to
be
no
reported
cases
of
such.
we
are
suggesting
that
different
considerations
apply,
considerations
to
which
equity
need
not
be
blind.
there
is
ground
for
believing
that
the
petitioners
may
have
sunk
from
site
before
the
administrative
proceedings
concluded
and
i
say
that's
particularly
true.
we
believe
where
public
interests
which
are
involved,
the
public
interest
in
having
various
modes
of
transportation
is
at
stake.
the
respondents
finally
suggest
that
the
government's
view
is
in
conflict
with
a
comment,
a
dictum
which
appears
in
this
court's
great
northern
opinion
in
1930.
the
court
there
did
state
that
congress
in
1910
have
entrusted
suspension
power
only
to
the
commission.
the
significance
of
that
dictum
must
be
appraised
in
terms
of
the
issue
that
was
actually
before
the
court
and
it's
worth
taking
a
moment
i
think
to
state
it.
a
state
regulatory
authority
in
that
case
had
prescribed
certain
intrastate
rates.
the
rail
carriers
were
--
reviewed
these
were
too
low.
they
brought
a
proceeding
therefore
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
under
section
13
invoking
the
shreveport
doctrine,
asking
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
raise
the
level
of
the
intrastate
rates
by
finding
as
is
required
under
the
section
that
those
intrastate
rates
imposed
a
discriminatory
burden
upon
interstate
commerce.
and
while
the
icc
was
considering
that
matter,
but
before
it
had
made
any
finding
whatever
if
there
was
any
burden
on
interstate
commerce,
the
carriers
also
went
into
court
to
secure
an
injunction
against
the
rates
prescribed
by
the
state
commission
while
the
federal
administrative
proceeding
was
pending.
quite
properly
we
think,
this
court
stated
that
the
judiciary
could
not
interfere
with
the
undoubted
regulatory
authority
of
the
state
which
could
be
overridden
only
in
the
manner
provided
by
congress.
that
is
to
say
after
a
finding
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
had
not
been
made,
that
interstate
commerce
was
being
prejudiced.
now
the
instant
case,
in
striking
contrast
to
great
northern,
involves
no
conflict
either
between
federal
and
state
or
more
pointedly
here
between
judicial
and
administrative
authority.
when
southern
filed
its
rates
in
this
case
there
were
two
issues
presented
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
first,
the
preliminary
issue
whether
there
was
reason
to
believe
that
the
rates
were
unlawful
and
should
therefore
be
suspended.
the
commission
has
answered
that
question
affirmatively,
for
a
court
to
accept
that
determination
and
to
proceed
upon
the
basis
of
it
obviously
can
work
no
interference
with
the
administrative
process.
and
the
second
issue
before
the
commission
is
the
ultimate
one
on
the
merits
whether
the
rates
are
lawful.
and
again,
no
one
can
suggest
that
if
the
status
quo
is
maintained
until
the
commission
can
make
its
final
decision
on
that
issue,
that
they'll
be
an
interference
with
the
agency.
stating
it
bluntly,
it
can
hardly
interfere
with
the
commission's
duty
to
decide
whether
these
rates
are
going
to
result
in
the
unlawful
destruction
of
the
barge
lines,
a
danger
which
the
commission
itself
has
at
least
apprehended
by
its
suspension
order,
if
the
courts
undertake
to
keep
the
barge
lines
alive
until
the
commission
can
write
its
opinion.
before
closing
and
i
don't
know
want
to
trench
on
my
colleague's
time
any
further,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
in
our
view,
one
seeking
an
injunction
after
the
statutory
suspension
period
has
been
exhausted
has
a
very
exacting
standard
to
meet.
we
would
suppose
that
he
must
show
injury
of
a
magnitude
and
gravity
which
go
far
beyond
the
ordinary
hardships
which
might
be
associated,
which
congress
we
think
associated,
with
having
to
pay
a
rate
of
questionable
validity
during
the
interim
period.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
i'm
only
suggesting
that
the
court
in
exercising
those
functions
must
have
a
fair
regard
for
what
we
conceive
to
be
the
balance
that
congress
was
attempting
to
strike.
we
don't
think
that
the
mere
fact
of
delay
and
which
maybe
involved
in
a
damage
remedy,
the
near
possibility
that
one
might
have
difficulties
of
proof
of
damages
would
in
light
of
this
entire
scheme
warrant
equitable
intervention.
we
think
problems
of
the
different
order
are
presented
in
a
case
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes
and
i
would
suppose
that
i
would
say
that
adequacy
is
relative
then
has
to
take
in
to
account
the
statutory
policies
and
the
congressional
judgments
that
are
involved.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
one
of
the
factors,
which
is
extremely
important
here
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
and
in
which
i
place
great
stress
is
not
only
that
its
absolute
and
final
but
that
there
are
public
as
well
as
private
interests
at
stake
and
i
take
it,
public
interests
are
not
compensable
at
all
in
damages.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
wouldn't
have
been
my
choice
[laughter].
i
assume
of
course
that
the
duty
of
appraising
the
equities
must
take
place
in
the
first
instance
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
and
i'm
not
fashioning
that
as
a
new
principle
of
equitable
jurisdiction
in
the
abstract.
what
i'm
saying
is
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
i
think
it
--
well,
not
only
that.
i'm
saying
and
i
think
it's
fairly
inferable
that
congress
may
have
made
a
judgment
that
these
ordinary
hardships
should
be
borne
seven
months
by
the
carriers
and
the
remaining
period
by
the
other
parties,
but
it
contemplated
throughout
that
there
would
be
an
ultimate
remedy
and
that
the
shipper
or
competing
carrier
would
be
around
and
in
existence
viable
there
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
the
final
order
in
the
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
actually
it's
gone
both
ways,
your
honor.
when
congress
in
1920
created
the
transportation
board,
it
thought
hopefully
that
by
relieving
the
icc
of
very
many
duties
was
a
creation
of
that
board,
that
the
icc
would
not
need
as
much
time.
i
think
the
icc
objected
to
the
reduction
of
it
then
made.
in
any
event
it
was
--
the
suspension
period
at
that
point
was
cut
down
to
five
months.
the
commission
repeatedly
went
back
to
congress
and
finally
secured
congressional
approval
of
seven
months
in
1927
and
it
stood
there
for
the
last
35
years
although
the
commission
with
the
increasing
pressure
of
business
and
the
increasing
difficulty
of
cases
since
1940
because
of
all
of
the
problems
of
intermodal
competition
has
been,
i
think
having
more
--
has
been
having
more
and
more
difficulty
in
meeting
its
deadline.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
have
to
check
on
that,
your
honor.
there's
certainly
no
legislative
change
since
then.
whether
any
bills
have
been
introduced,
i
not
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
have
not
considered
it
in
relation
to
that.
i
have
considered
it
in
relation
to
all
of
the
statutes
which
have
similar
provision
for
a
suspension
of
rate.
that
would
be
the
natural
gas
and
federal
power
act,
communications
act
and
the
aviation
act.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i'd
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
have
it.
you
know,
i've
looked
at
the
provisions
which
are
now,
i
guess
in
the
sense
they
are
ratemaking
statutes.
they
are
--
the
ones
i
just
mentioned
are
modeled
pretty
much
on
the
--
on
section
15
(7).
the
other
agencies
have
not
had
this
kind
of
problem
in
by
and
large
and
it's
understandable
that
there
is
not
because
the
most
difficult
and
time
consuming
cases
are
the
ones
which
involved
the
very
difficult
economic
problems
of
competition
between
different
molds
and
the
icc
having
water
carriers,
rail
carriers
and
trucking
interests
under
its
jurisdiction
is
vexed
to
a
degree
i
think
that
the
other
[inaudible]
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
in
the
--
the
power
commission
of
course
has
a
tremendous
burden
of
rate
proceedings.
i'd
never
known
any
power
commission
case
however,
in
each
it
was
suggested
that
an
increase
in
gas
rates
is
going
to
put
the
pipelines
out
of
business.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no.
i
was
merely
attending
to
convey
that
i
thought
that
that
has
been
the
practical
problem.
that
is
the
type
of
case
which
is
apt
to
present
a
claim
of
destruction
of
a
public
interest.
it's
also
the
type
of
case
which
is
characteristically
a
long
and
hard
fought
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
the
policy
of
the
act
as
i
intended
to
develop
earlier
would
lead
one
to
the
conclusion
that
equity
or
not
intervene,
where
damages
were
available
and
ought
not
to
intervene
perhaps
even
if
there
was
a
threatened
loss
of
profits
and
there
would
be
grave
difficulties
of
proof.
i
draw
this
from
the
consideration
that
congress
balanced
the
equities,
one
might
say
in
that
type
of
situation.
but
certainly,
as
we
view
the
history,
it
did
not
preclude
equitable
intervention
in
an
extraordinary
situation
where
only
equitable
intervention
could
in
effect
make
the
proceeding
meaningful
and
preserved
the
parties
who
were
involved
in
the
public
interest
which
where
at
stake.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
would
say
that
it's
certainly
fairly
to
say
in
1910.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
think
that
is
so.
and
i
think
in
the
shipper
case,
it
would
be
much
more
unusual
where
one
could
present
as
compelling
a
claim
upon
equities
that
seems
to
be
available
on
the
allegations
here.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
no,
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
yes.
certainly,
the
act
undertakes
to
prevent
the
inherent
advantages
of
every
mode
of
transportation
whichever
one
may
happen
to
have
it.
now,
we
don't
know
on
this
record
yet
which
mode
has
the
advantage.
maybe
southern
will
establish
these
rates
perfectly
lawful,
that
they
represent
nothing
more
than
improve
the
transportation
techniques,
that
they're
not
as
arrow
suggests
far
below
their
fully
distributed
costs.
they
should
be
entitled
to
charge
these
rates
because
they
reflect
an
economic
advantage
and
improvement
in
transportation.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
we
have
placed
no
reliance
on
it
and
i'm
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
there
are
--
there's
of
course
the
problem
there
as
to
whether
it
applies
at
the
instance
of
a
private
suitor.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
i
believe
was
as
to
whether
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
establish
the
rates,
they
preceded
the
ratemaking
process.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
that
of
course
was
also
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
the
georgia
case
was
before
the
rebulink
last
year
if
your
honor
will
recall
and
subject
to
certain
limitations
there's
now
an
immunity
for
agreement
among
carriers
of
those
rates.
i'm
going
to
leave
it
to
the
petitioner's
counsel
to
develop
his
antitrust
theory.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
i
don't
--
i
don't
--
i'm
not
fully
--
i'm
not
relying
on
that.
we've
proceeded
upon
a
basis
of
the
allegations
that
a
competing
mode
of
transportation
might
be
destroyed
by
unlawful
rates
and
believe
that
those
are
allegations,
certainly
that
the
carriers
ought
to
be
--
that
water
carriers
ought
to
be
entitled
--
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
--
to
prove
if
they
can.
mr.
ralph
s.
spritzer
well,
i
have
assumed
that
the
primary
point
for
determination
here
was
whether
realization
of
the
purposes
of
the
commission
proceeding,
the
pending
proceeding
permits
the
grant
of
an
ancillary
injunction
and
our
submission
is
based
entirely
upon
an
analysis
of
the
judicial
power
in
relation
to
the
commission
proceeding
which
is
pending,
your
honor.
