justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
said
they
had
extended
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
it
voluntary?
justice
john
m.
harlan
have
you
considered
if
there's
any
power,
any
question
as
to
the
power
of
congress
to
do
that
if
they
wished
to?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
think
there's
any
constitutional
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
a
refusal
of
the
commission
to
issue
a
stay
to
be
reviewable
with
the
court's
findings?
justice
john
m.
harlan
clearly
now,
wouldn't
they,
under
the
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
a
question
before
you
sit
down?
have
any
efforts
made
[inaudible]
to
extend
the
seven
month
period?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
probably
not
as
much
as
the
power
commission.
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
opposite
of
your
present
case
here
and
i
am
asking
you
if
the
railroad
asked
for
an
increase
in
rates
and
the
government
and
the
commission
suspended
those
rates
for
seven
months.
could
they
go
into
a
federal
court
and
alleged
that
unless
they
put
those
rates
into
effect
the
railroad
company
would
become
insolvent
and
have
to
go
out
of
business,
would
that
give
the
court
jurisdiction?
