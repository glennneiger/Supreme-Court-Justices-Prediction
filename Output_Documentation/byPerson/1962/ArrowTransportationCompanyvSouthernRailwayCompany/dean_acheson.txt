mr.
dean
acheson
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
the
question
just
asked
by
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
we
all
recall
that
mr.
lovett,
in
his
argument
said
that
the
southern
railway
put
these
rates
into
effect
without
consultation
with
any
other
railroad,
and
i
think
we
have
a
footnote
in
our
brief
which
indicates
that
that
argument,
the
footnote
appears
on
page
10
of
our
brief,
that
that
our
argument
has
been
abandoned.
mr.
dean
acheson
correct.
mr.
dean
acheson
now,
may
i
–
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
dean
acheson
i'm
sorry.
mr.
dean
acheson
i
agree
right
there.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
is
true.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
is
correct.
now,
if
the
court
read
it,
may
i
go
back
and
try
to
state
what
this
case
is
about
and
the
issues
involved
in
it,
and
the
attitudes
of
the
forties
in
regard
to
those
issues.
because
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
wandered
a
bit
over
the
field
today.
this
case
involved
as
section
of
the
interstate
of
commerce
act,
section
15,
paragraph
7.
that
section
in
one
form
or
another,
pretty
much
the
same
form,
has
been
in
effect
for
half
a
century.
during
that
half
century,
the
shippers,
carriers,
lawyers,
commission,
courts,
including
this
court
have
believed
that
this
statute
meant
exactly
what
it
said.
the
court
below
found
this
statute
a
model
of
clarity.
it
is
now
for
the
first
time
in
this
half
century,
being
suggested
that
the
statute
should
be
given
a
new
look.
and
that
it
be
given
--
being
given
a
new
look,
it
should
be
fitted
out
conceptions
which
have
been
suggested
from
the
bench
to
be
holy
and
novel
in
the
law.
15
(7)
does
something
in
1910
--
did
something
in
1910
which
was
novel.
first
of
all,
it
gave
the
commission
the
power
to
determine
the
legality
of
rates
before
they
went
into
effect.
and
it
gave
it
--
and
it
said
that
the
rates
should
not
be
lawful
unless
and
until
they
were
filed
by
the
commission
which
might
then
start
its
investigation.
the
rates
might
not
go
into
effect
for
one
month
after
they
were
filed
with
the
commission.
the
commission
might
while
it
was
investigating
the
rate
--
rates
suspend
their
operation,
so
that
they
would
not
go
into
effect
one
month
after
they
filed
with
it,
about
--
might
be
suspended
up
to
a
period
of
time
fixed
in
the
statute.
i
shall
later
on
go
over
the
changes
in
the
times
of
suspension
which
interested
justice
harlan
a
moment
ago.
it
also
provided
that
when
that
period
of
suspension
came
to
an
end,
it
provided
in
1920
and
later
on,
that
the
rates
shouldn't
go
into
effect.
in
1910
it
was
silent
in
regard
to
this.
this
is
the
statute
which
we
are
involved
with
today
and
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
after
the
period
of
suspension
authorized
by
the
statue
extended
as
it
was
here
by
agreement
of
the
southern
railway,
after
that
period
has
expired,
in
the
face
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
may
a
district
court
of
the
united
states
intervene
and
draft
a
restraining
order.
the
case
has
been
stated
to
you,
but
perhaps
it
might
be
well
to
go
over
that
again
also.
the
southern
railway
filed
rates
in
1961,
new
rates
on
grain
moving
from
the
river
crossings
into
the
territory
of
the
celtic.
these
rates
were
drastic
reductions
of
rates
already
in
effect.
i
shall
later
on
have
occasion
to
comment
on
this
chart
and
what
it
says
about
those
rates.
i
shall
content
myself
at
this
moment
by
saying
that
the
rates
were
drastically
reduced
because
they
involved
a
great
innovation
in
ratemaking
and
in
transportation,
and
in
a
moment
i
should
tell
you
why.
the
reason
for
this,
the
reason
why
it
is
an
innovation
is
that,
first
of
all,
new
cars
were
designed
and
built
by
people
who
had
never
built
railway
cars
before
the
boeing
aircraft
company.
these
were
aluminum
cars
that
were
larger
than
the
ordinary
cars.
they
carried
twice
the
cargo
weight
at
half
the
dead
weight
of
a
car.
again,
the
rate
structure
was
different.
this
was
a
multiple
car
movement.
it
was
--
the
series
of
--
numbers
of
cars
could
be
moved
from
one
consignor
to
one
consignee
without
breaking
bulk
and
without,
what
is
called
frills,
without
privileges
in
transit,
in
other
words,
giving
the
same
service
to
the
shipper
by
rail
as
was
given
to
him
by
the
barge
or
buck
--
or
truck
carrier.
that
is,
it
could
be
moved
without
breaking
bulk
in
one
movement
by
one
consignor
to
one
consignee
and
these
savings
prod
--
produced
a
very
much
lower
rate.
i
have
to
--
as
i
say
at
the
end
of
the
period,
the
commission
suspended
the
rates
for
a
period
of
seven
months.
it
found
what
has
been
stated
to
this
court
in
response
perhaps
to
a
question
by
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
the
commission
is
not
required
to
find
anything.
it
is
only
required
to
give
the
reason
for
a
suspension.
it
could
give
it
if
it
like
the
reason
that
it
thought
out
in
a
whole
it
was
a
fair
thing
to
do.
in
this
case,
it
found
that
the
commission
had
reason
to
believe
that
the
rates
might
be
illegal
and
that
they're
unreasonable
and
illegal,
unlawful
rates
and
that
they
might
be
unjust
and
in
violation
of
the
national
transportation
policy.
this
was
the
finding
before
evidence
without
hit
--
before
evidence
was
taken
without
hearing,
without
argument.
it
need
give
only
its
reasons.
at
the
end
of
the
time
as
i've
said,
application
was
made
to
a
district
court
to
continue
or
to
give
an
injunction
which
would
continue
this
suspension.
the
district
court
denied
relief
finding
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction.
this
went
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
which
affirmed
the
district
court.
from
that
time
on
there
have
been
temporary
restraining
orders,
interlocutory
injunctions,
pending
appeal
and
pending
this
hearing
granted
by
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
and
by
a
justice
of
this
court.
now,
before
turning
to
argument
i
should
like
state
to
the
court
what
i
would
call
the
anatomy
of
the
argument.
what
are
the
issues?
what
attitudes
do
the
various
parties
take
toward
those
issues?
this
is
complicated
because
very
often
there
are
three
attitudes,
one
by
the
respondent,
one
by
the
petitioner,
one
by
the
government.
i
should
try
to
state
them
all
to
the
court.
let
us
start
with
the
statute.
as
i
said
the
statute,
it
gives
the
commission
authority
to
determine
the
legality
of
rates.
it
gives
the
commission
power
to
suspend
rates
but
now
only
for
seven
months
and
it
then
provides
that
if
the
commission
has
not
decided
the
case,
at
the
end
of
the
period
of
suspension
the
rates
shall
go
into
effect.
it
doesn't
say
they
may
go
into
effect.
it
says
they
shall
go
into
effect.
now,
let's
take
up
these
three
statements
in
the
statute.
first
of
all,
all
parties
agree,
the
respondent,
the
petitioner,
the
government,
they
all
agree
that
the
authority
to
determine
the
lawfulness
of
the
rate
is
given
solely
to
the
commission.
no
court,
nobody
else
may
interfere
with
the
commission's
decision
of
that
question
except
on
appeal
after
decision
is
made.
now,
so
far
as
suspension
is
concerned,
all
parties
agree
that
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
suspend
is
in
the
first
instance
its
own.
no
court
may
suspend,
unless
the
commission
has
done
so
first
and
unless
the
commission
has
given
some
reason
that
it
believes,
there
is
occasion
to
believe
that
the
rates
may
be
unlawful.
there's
no
question
abut
that.
if
the
commission
should
not
suspend,
these
petitioners
would
not
make
the
argument
that
they
make
here.
it
would
be
either
agreed
by
all
of
us
that
no
court
may
intervene
no
matter
how
great
the
showing
of
damage
maybe.
now,
i
think
it
is
also
agreed,
although
i'm
not
so
sure
of
this,
i
think
the
--
our
two
other
opponents
would
agree
that
if
this
commission
suspends
for
less
than
the
full
period
and
then
allows
the
rates
to
go
into
effect,
no
court
may
intervene
no
matter
how
great
the
damage
maybe
because
there
would
then
be
no
statement
of
any
sort
by
the
commission
which
it
is
admitted
must
make
this
statement
that
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
rates
would
be
unlawful.
we've
come
apart
when
we
have
the
situation
created
--
that
exists
here,
a
situation
where
the
commission
has
suspended
for
the
full
period
of
time,
and
then
under
the
statute
the
rates
shall
go
into
effect.
in
that
situation,
there
are
three
different
views.
our
own
view,
the
respondent's
view
is
that
the
power
to
suspend,
to
enjoin,
to
prevent
the
rates
from
going
into
effect
has
been
given
solely
to
the
commission
and
no
one
else
and
that
the
legislative
history
to
which
i
shall
come
to
would
indicate
that
that
is
so.
and
we
contend
further
that
there
has
been
a
legislative
balancing
of
equities
or
convenience
here,
arriving
at
the
conclusion
that
rates
shall
not
be
suspended
for
more
than
seven
months.
that
during
that
time
the
railroad
shall
bear
the
irreparable
injury
for
which
it
has
no
action
at
law
if
its
rates
should
turn
out
to
be
lawful
and
that
thereafter,
other
parties
shall
bear
whatever
burden
they
bear
because
they
do
have
rights
to
recover
damages.
that
is
our
view.
now
the
petitioner's
view
is
a
different
one.
the
petitioners
say
that
the
power
of
the
courts
to
suspend
existed
before
1910.
i
shall
discuss
this
later
on.
it
says
that
the
mann-elkins
act,
the
act
of
1910
which
we
have
been
talking
about
modified
this
rate
but
did
not
abrogate.
it
modified
it
and
if
it
existed
before,
now,
after
1910,
it
--
an
action
could
not
be
brought
and
that's
the
commission
had
taken
these
prior
steps.
but
if
the
commission
has
then
an
action
maybe
brought
in
to
courts,
say
the
petitioners,
because
the
time
limit
they
say
applies
only
to
the
commission
and
not
to
the
courts.
our
answers
to
this
will
--
perhaps
it
appeared
from
what
i
have
said
and
will
appear
more
later.
now
the
government
takes
a
different
position
from
this.
it
takes
the
position
debutante
about
the
situation
before
1910.
now,
it
says
quite
correctly
that
some
courts
did
intervene
a
granted
injunction.
it
referred
to
mr.
justice
hughes
opinion
in
the
great
northern
case
in
which
it
is
pure
dicta,
dicta
by
a
very
important
and
honored
judge,
who
says
that
in
his
opinion
the
better
view
wasn't
before
1910.
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
a
court
to
grant
an
injunction.
but
in
any
rate
the
government
says,
whether
or
not
it
existed
before
1910,
it
was
created
by
the
act
of
1910.
the
government
says
the
very
opposite
of
what
respondents
say.
we
say
the
act
of
1910
gave
it
solely
to
the
commission.
the
government
says,
no
by
a
curious
sort
of
--
perhaps
unintended
result,
the
courts
were
given
this
power
because
once
the
commission
could
find
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
was
unlawfulness
and
issued
a
suspension
order
then
the
courts
could
do
what
they
had
not
been
able
to
do
before,
rely
upon
the
commission's
finding
and
extend
the
injunction.
but
the
government
goes
on
and
says
that
the
petitioners
are
quite
wrong
in
believing
that
there
injunction
from
the
courts
maybe
activated
by
a
plaintiff
who
is
about
to
suffer
irreparable
injury.
they
say
this
is
not
so.
now,
whether
they
say
the
added
requirement
as
a
jurisdictional
requirement
or
not,
i
gather
this
morning
from
my
distinguished
colleague
that
he
thinks
it
is
a
not
jurisdictional
in
addition
but
it
is
merely
a
requirement
that
the
court
should
be
careful
how
they
had.
however,
he
says
that
he
would
not
believe
that
an
injunction
is
warranted
by
a
person
who
appears
before
the
court
of
plaintiff,
who
has
what
he
calls,
the
ordinary
or
garden
variety
of
irreparable
injury.
garden
varieties
won't
work
in
this
case.
now
the
plaintiff
must
have
what
i
suppose
to
bullet
--
battle
the
parley
of
trade
would
call
a
super
colossal
irreparable
injury.
it
must
be
something
the
government
says,
amounting
to
extinction
or
some
very
grave
difficulty.
in
other
words,
the
propriety
of
the
action
is
not
the
jurisdiction
to
action.
it
depends
upon
the
degree
of
the
plaintiff's
anguish.
but
it
is
ordinary
--
ordinary
anguish,
the
court
may
not
act.
if
it
is
very
great
anguish
then
it
should
act,
but
the
anguish
must
be
quite
a
bit
greater
than
the
ordinary.
now,
as
had
been
pointed
out,
this
suggestion
is
a
wholly
novel
one.
this
has
no
basis
either
in
the
history
of
the
statute,
the
legislature
--
the
legislative
history
nor
does
it
have
any
basis
in
prior
court
decisions
on
equity
jurisdiction,
nor
does
it
have
any
basis
in
legal
history.
this
is
wholly
new.
not
only
is
it
wholly
new
but
it
raises
questions
which
the
government
has
not
--
to
which
the
government
has
not
given
us
the
answer.
it
is
all
very
well
to
say
that
it
requires
a
plaintiff
with
a
super
colossal
injury
to
come
into
court
to
get
the
injunction,
but
for
whose
benefit
does
the
injunction
run?
does
the
injunction
only
run
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
will
suffer
this
super
injury?
if
that
is
so
then
obviously
there
will
be
a
multiplicity
of
rates
or
perhaps
the
government
suggests
that
the
rights
--
rates
might
be
varied
according
to
the
degree
of
injury.
if
a
plaintiff
comes
in
and
says,
“i'm
about
to
be
put
out
off
of
business,”
the
junction
must
issue
--
it
is
at
--
going
to
mean
that
everyone
else
is
protected
whether
he
--
whether
they
have
just
garden
injury
or
not,
or
should
there
be
as
i
say
this
variety
of
rates.
shall
the
court
tamper
the
rate
to
the
shaw
and
lamb
or
is
the
shaw
and
lamb
the
plaintiff
which
gets
benefits
for
all
the
lands
and
this
will
present,
i
believe
to
the
courts
rather
--
more
problems
than
the
government
expects
to
solve.
this
then
is
the
anatomy
of
the
argument
before
us.
before
we
go
into
that
argument,
may
i
say
a
few
words
about
the
background?
this
is
what
my
distinguished
friend
and
colleague,
mr.
lovett,
argued
to
the
court
this
morning
and
they
--
the
background
is
illustrated
and
by
--
what
he
said
and
by
the
map
behind
me.
he
pictures
the
background,
how
does
this
struggle,
he
says
the
chapter
in
the
struggle
in
the
tennessee
valley
between
the
barge
lines
and
the
railroads.
this
--
i
--
we
shall
not
discuss,
it
would
seem
to
me
quite
unlikely
that
if
this
was
solely
a
struggle
between
two
types
of
carriers,
we
would
have
found
the
interveners
in
this
case
that
we
have
both
before
the
commission
and
in
some
cases
before
this
court.
why
for
instance
would
the
southern
governor's
conference
or
the
departments
of
agriculture
of
the
united
states,
or
of
north
carolina
or
virginia,
or
missouri
or
the
american
farm
bureau
federation,
or
the
georgia
poultry
federation
or
the
alabama
cattlemen
association,
or
the
georgia
or
north
carolina
public
utilities
commission,
or
the
southeastern
association
of
railroad
and
utilities
commissioners
or
the
national
association
of
railroad
and
utilities
commission,
why
should
they
intervene
before
the
commissioners
are
here
if
this
is
only
a
fact
recital
route
between
two
carries?
i
wish
to
refer
to
a
different
background
and
for
a
different
reason.
it
is
not
to
say
who
is
sheep
and
who
is
wolf,
but
to
say
why
these
rates
have
been
put
into
effect.
the
result
of
the
government's
argument
and
of
the
petitioners'
argument
is
that
at
an
early
stage
of
the
ratemaking
process
the
courts
should
be
injected
to
do
what
the
government
calls
their
traditional
task
of
weighing
the
equities.
what
i
am
about
to
say
on
the
back
is
to
show
to
your
honor
that
it
is
nothing
of
this
sort.
there
is
no
tradition
about
what
the
courts
will
be
doing
here.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
thing
that
a
court
is
equipped
to
do
or
has
done
or
can
do.
and
why
do
i
say
that?
before
the
commission,
evidence
was
introduced
to
show
the
history
of
the
carriage
of
grain
in
the
southeast,
into
the
southeast
over
the
last
five
years
in
regard
to
which
figures
were
available.
the
figures
which
i'm
about
to
state
to
the
court,
i
do
not
wish
to
represent
as
absolutely
accurate
statistical
figures.
the
figures
for
carriage
by
rail
at
water
are
accurate
and
complete.
the
carry
--
figures
for
carriage
by
truck
have
been
estimated
by
statistical
methods
used
by
the
department
of
agriculture
and
others
who
were
engaged
in
trying
to
discover
the
amount
of
grain
imported
by
unregulated
carriers.
and
therefore
this
is
--
there
isn't
element
of
estimate
about
this
and
the
figures
can
be
wrong
by
say
10%.
now,
what
do
these
figures
show?
they
show
that
over
the
five
years
from
1955
to
1960,
the
railroads
carried
at
the
beginning
55%
of
all
the
grain
introduced
into
the
southeast.
at
the
end
of
that
period
they
carried
22%,
less
than
half
in
five
years.
it
showed
that
the
trucks
neither
did
--
that
the
water
carriers
in
1955
carried
a
quarter,
25%
of
all
the
grain
brought
into
the
southeast.
at
the
end
of
the
period
they
carried
21%.
trucks
at
the
beginning
of
the
period
carried
20%
and
at
the
end
they
carried
57%,
almost
three
times
as
much
but
this
your
honors
is
only
half
the
story.
between
1955
and
1960,
the
amount
of
grain
brought
into
the
southeastern
section
of
the
united
states
tripled.
it
increased
by
seven
and
a
third
million
tons
of
grain
and
it
is
interesting
to
say
who
shared
in
that
new
business.
the
new
business
which
was
twice
as
rate
as
the
whole
business
which
existed
before
it.
the
railroad
gained
less
than
half
a
million
tons
out
of
this
seven
and
a
third
million.
the
barges
gained
a
million
and
a
third
they
increased
their
carriage
by
250%.
the
trucks
gained
five-and-a-half
million
tons
of
grain
and
as
i
say,
rose
from
20
to
57%
of
the
carriage.
now
this
truck
competition,
your
honors,
is
something
new.
this
is
new
since
the
war.
this
is
a
new
development
arising
out
of
the
great
increase
in
super
highway,
the
great
increase
in
automobile
production
which
has
produced
enumerable
new
trucks
which
one
can
buy
with
a
small
down
payment
and
the
nature
of
this
carriage,
this
is
99%
unregulated.
these
are
not
great
truck
lines
which
are
carrying
as
common
carriers.
these
are
small
gypsy
truckers
who
carry
southern
goods
north.
they
carry
fruits,
lumber,
vegetables,
stones
of
various
kinds,
marbles,
sand
stones,
whatever
it
maybe.
they
carry
this
north
and
on
the
back
haul
they
pick
up
grain
and
carry
this
into
the
south.
and
usually
the
owner-driver-operator
buys
the
grain
himself
and
sells
it
when
he
gets
into
the
south.
and
because
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
pay
a
little
more
than
the
added
cost
of
gasoline
for
loading
his
truck,
his
rate
and
his
profit
on
the
grain
are
the
same
thing.
nobody
knows
what
these
rates
are,
there
are
no
rates.
these
are
private
treaties.
sometimes
they're
not
treaties
at
all
as
i
have
said.
he
merely
buys
grain,
carries
it
south
and
sells
it.
much
of
the
barge
traffic
is
wholly
unregulated
also
or
you
mean
to
escape
from
the
regulation
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
by
carrying
grain
by
barge
is
to
carry
only
grain
in
one
tow.
this
takes
you
out
from
under
regulation.
of
course
if
you
have
a
barge
made
out
of
something
else
in,
then
you
are
not
exempt
under
default
commodity
provisions.
and
so
a
great
deal
of
it
is
done
by
private
carriage
also
and
there
are
no
terms,
no
rates
are
fixed.
a
great
many
of
the
barge
lines
of
whom
i
believe,
although
i
do
not
dare
assert
that
the
petitioner
here
is
one,
are
alliances
which
do
not
own
equipment
at
all.
they
lease
equipment
from
stockholders
who
owned
the
equipment
in
connection
with
their
own
business,
such
as
sand
and
gravel
companies.
they
get
the
other
with
other
companies
and
form
a
barge
line.
there
equipment
is
used
by
the
barge
line
and
what
is
rate,
what
is
dividend,
what
is
profit,
nobody
can
ascertain.
therefore,
briefly
i
point
that
this
--
this
chart
is
all
based
on
the
basis
that
published
common
carrier
tariffs
are
being
charged
and
that
at
--
because
those
tariffs
are
charged,
the
barge
line
will
go
out
of
business.
so,
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
fact.
there
are
various
rates
which
were
on
the
end,
have
been
taken
off
showing
a
barge
rate
at
guntersville
and
then
a
rail
rate
to
birmingham.
and
they
said
they're
--
they've
denied
proposed
rates
that
so
much
of
that
combination
of
these
published
common
carrier
barge
rates
and
the
published
common
carrier
truck
or
rail
rates
that
they
would
be
out
of
business,
but
that
isn't
what
happened.
this
is
all
fanciful.
the
idea
of
the
--
this
super
colossal
injury
is
going
to
take
place
days
upon
a
series
of
assumptions
which
in
fact
on
our
proof
and
in
my
judgment
cannot
be
proved.
but
aside
from
that,
what
i
have
been
saying
to
the
court
about
the
background
of
transportation
in
the
south
--
into
the
southeast
is
not
an
unusual
story.
this
has
been
coming
about,
ever
since
the
development
of
the
throughways
and
the
development
of
the
trucks.
and
it
is
clear
that
only
drastic
innovation
by
the
railways
is
going
to
keep
the
railways
alive.
if
they
go
on
with
their
conventional
rates
and
a
conventional
traffic
patterns,
and
their
conventional
traffic
arrangements,
the
railroads
are
bound
to
lose
as
they
have
lost
here
all
the
new
business
which
a
developing
economy
is
bringing
about,
they
are
bound
to
lose
that
to
the
truckers
and
to
the
barge
lines.
mr.
dean
acheson
this
is
--
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
sir.
i
completely
disregard
those.
mr.
dean
acheson
because
i
think
they
are
based
upon
what
i've
just
been
showing
you
here.
your
honor,
if
you
take
published
rates
and
assume
that
all
carriage
is
carried
on
by
the
published
rates
of
the
barge
lines
and
trucks,
when
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
perhaps
from
80
to
95%
is
not
carried
on
then
the
deductions
made
from
the
published
rates
are
perfectly
true
and
if
these
were
in
truth
the
fact
somebody
would
suffer
severely
but
it
isn't
the
fact.
and
therefore
i
--
it
seems
to
me
that
for
a
court
to
believe
what
everybody
knows
is
not
the
fact
is
for
the
court
to
take
on
unnecessary
blindness
at
any
rate.
your
honors'
accusation
about
my
attitude
is
correct,
yes
sir,
it
is
entirely
correct.
now
i
was
saying
this
innovation
has
got
to
attrition.
this
isn't
my
statement.
this
is
the
president's
statement.
the
president's
transportation
message
says
that
this
is
essential.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
half
a
dozen
recent
decisions
has
called
for
innovation
by
the
railroads
and
here
we
have
innovation.
innovation
means
lower
rates.
it
means
new
patterns
of
transportation.
it
means
new
rate
patterns
also
and
this
means
that
somebody
is
going
to
make
less
money
or
somebody
is
going
to
be
hurt.
it
may
be
that
they
are
seriously
hurt.
i
would
be
extravagant
if
i
said
nobody
would
be
hurt
in
any
way
from
this
rate
--
these
rates.
they
will
be
hurt,
but
this
is
what
competition
is
about.
someone
is
always
hurt
by
competition.
the
railways
cannot
exist
if
the
rule
laid
upon
them
is
that
you
may
not
change
your
rates
so
that
you
inconvenience
any
of
your
competitors.
if
this
is
the
rule,
the
railroads
are
out
of
business.
if
the
rule
is
as
the
national
transportation
policy
asserts
that
the
nation
--
natural
advantages
of
each
form
of
traffic
are
to
be
preserved,
then
here
is
a
natural
advantage
to
the
railroads.
mr.
dean
acheson
that
is
correct,
sir.
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
heart
of
the
matter
before
the
commission
and
the
commission,
one
of
the
questions
was
if
you
carry
in
bulk
in
one
large
movement
from
st.
louis
to
birmingham
by
rail
that's
a
nation
--
natural
advantage
of
the
rails.
if
you
have
to
come
from
st.
louis
and
unload
a
barge,
load
it
on
the
railroad
transit
and
carry
it
to
somewhere
else
and
then
unload
it,
that's
a
disadvantage,
a
natural
disadvantage
of
the
barge
lines.
at
any
rate,
i
am
giving
you
this
background
for
the
purpose
of
coming
to
the
one
point
that
i
want
to
make
out
of
it
and
that
is
that
in
a
situation
like
this,
no
court,
no
united
states
district
judge,
unguided
by
the
investigation
of
an
expert
agency,
unhelped
by
the
findings
and
analysis
and
the
recommendations
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
capable
of
weighing
the
equity.
he
doesn't
even
know
what
the
equities
are.
suppose
it
is
true
that
weaker
barge
operators
will
go
into
bankruptcy.
how
do
you
weigh
that
equity
against
the
whole
advantage
to
the
southeast
of
the
united
states
in
lower
cost
of
grain,
increased
developments
in
summer
of
the
states?
some
cities
where
new
elevators
will
be
erected,
new
business
will
occur,
a
larger
and
cheaper
poultry
industry,
how
do
you
weigh
these
equities
in
the
traditional
sense?
it
is
only
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
is
equipped
and
staffed
to
find
out
what
the
net
of
all
these
changes
in
the
economy
of
a
vast
area
which
is
equipped
to
find
out
whether
this
will
in
the
long
run
benefit
the
development
of
a
complete
transportation
system.
it
is
only
the
commission
that
is
able
to
weigh
these
equities
and
this
is
why
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
put
these
powers
and
these
duties
upon
the
commission
and
not
upon
the
courts.
this
is
the
reason
for
the
creation
of
the
commission
in
the
first
place
and
for
giving
it
the
power
to
suspend
and
only
giving
it
to
the
commission.
are
the
courts,
if
my
brethren's
view
here
is
persuasive
to
the
court,
are
district
courts
to
intervene
at
the
end
of
seven
months,
take
witnesses
away
from
the
hearing
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
duplicate
its
investigation
into
what
is
going
on
to
find
out
what
the
equities
are
and
how
they
should
be
balanced.
mr.
dean
acheson
[inaudible]
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
sir,
it
has
not
been
done.
mr.
dean
acheson
my
point,
your
honor
is
that
not
only
are
the
courts
incapable
of
weighing
those
equities
but
to
the
congress
has
said
they
should
not
weigh
those
equities,
but
that
the
commission
should.
mr.
dean
acheson
[inaudible]
--
mr.
dean
acheson
how
are
the
courts
to
determine
this
question?
how
are
the
courts
to
determine
whether
the
rights
are
compensatory
or
not?
mr.
dean
acheson
well,
it
certainly
would,
most
certainly
would
deny
that,
your
honor.
we
haven't
had
any
trial.
of
course,
and
we
hope
we
never
we'll
have
a
trial
but
they
would
deny
it
without
any
hesitation.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes.
mr.
dean
acheson
the
court
did
and
i'm
saying
the
court
is
incapable
of
wisely
coming
to
that
conclusion.
you
really
have
to
have
the
expert
knowledge
of
the
commission
to
know
whether
the
total
sum
of
equities
involved
here,
some
of
which
can
never
be
represented
before
the
court
at
all,
the
interest
of
all
the
consumers
in
the
southeast
which
is
represented
before
the
commission,
the
interest
of
the
truck
carriers
who
are
not
before
the
commission
at
all,
the
interest
of
communities
in
the
south
which
are
not
before
the
court.
these
things
cannot
be
dealt
within
a
court
and
congress
knew
that
they
couldn't
be
and
knowing
it
wrote
the
statute
that
they
did
write.
now
may
i
--
i
am
reminded
that
the
court,
mr.
justice
black,
i'm
reminded
that
the
court
below
only
found
irreparable
injury
that
there
--
that
the
affidavits
indicated
irreparable
injury
but
not
that
they
would
be
put
out
of
business
at
all.
mr.
dean
acheson
this
is
based
on
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
united
states
district
court
in
alabama.
mr.
dean
acheson
on
the
affidavits,
which
were
before
the
court,
you
and
i
were
discussing
a
moment
ago.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
the
affidavits
charged
so
but
the
court
did
not
find
it
so.
mr.
dean
acheson
the
--
this
was
one
of(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
they
would
lose
money
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dean
acheson
it
is
quite
right,
it
is.
now
may
i
come
with
this
perhaps
over
long
introduction
to
a
discussion
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
section
15,
paragraph
7.
it
means
we
assert
what
it
says
and
the
language
is
plain
enough.
if
the
proceeding
has
not
been
concluded
and
an
order
made
within
the
period
of
suspension,
the
proposed
change
of
rate
shall
go
into
effect
at
the
end
of
such
period.
it's
the
language
one
would
think
was
played.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
said,
“perhaps,
to
make
it
plainer,
it
should
say
positively
go
into
effect.”
perhaps
that
would
make
it
plainer
but
not
much
plain
and
this,
your
honor
presents
--
your
honors
presents
to
a
person
in
my
position
with
the
problem.
how
does
one
argue
the
obvious?
one
can
only
perhaps
go
on
saying
it
over
and
over
again
which
would
be
tiresome
and
would
not
help
the
court.
but
perhaps,
one
way
to
argue
the
obvious
is
to
show
what
the
problem
was
before
the
statute
went
into
effect.
what
the
congress
was
discussing?
what
the
issues
were
before
the
congress?
and
how
the
congress
undertook
the
deal
with
that
problem?
now
before
the
mann-elkins
act
of
1910,
there
was
they
say
the
very
least,
the
gravest
question
is
to
whether
the
united
states
courts
had
any
authority
to
enjoin
these
rates
while
the
commission
was
investigating.
mr.
chief
justice
hughes
thought
they
had
no
power
to
do
this
at
all
but
i
think
it's
irrelevant
to
hear
whether
they
had
it
or
whether
there
was
great
doubt
about
it,
certainly
there
was
the
land.
in
1910,
the
congress
intervened
into
this,
into
this
situation
and
it
authorized
the
commission
to
suspend
rates
and
only
the
commission.
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
statute
to
indicate
that
it
was
granting
authority,
if
authority
did
not
exist
that
it
was
granting
authority
to
the
united
states
courts.
there's
not
a
word
of
that
sort
there.
there
is
not
a
word
of
any
sort
except
desultory
statements
by
various
members
of
congress
during
debate
as
to
whether
they
were
considering
the
question
of
granting.
this
question
was
not
issue.
it
was
not
before
the
congress
at
all.
the
bill
proposed,
the
committee
has
proposed,
everyone
discussed
giving
this
power
to
the
commission.
not
a
soul
proposed
except
senator
la
follette
that
it
should
be
given
to
anyone
else
and
senator
la
follette's
proposal
as
you
have
heard
was
rejected.
the
issue
which
was
discussed
was
a
real
issue
and
in
this
issue
the
sides
were
pretty
well
formed
between
the
progressives,
the
insurgent,
republicans
on
one
side
and
the
more
conservative
members
of
the
congress
on
the
other.
and
this
issue
was,
shall
we
take
away
from
the
railroads
their
prior
power,
shall
we
take
completely
away
from
the
railroads
their
prior
power
to
put
rates
into
effect
first
and
litigate
them
afterwards
or,
shall
we
say
that
after
a
reasonable
chance
has
been
given
for
the
commission
to
look
into
these
rates,
we
will
divide
the
irreparable
injury.
everybody
knew
there
was
going
to
be
irreparable
injury.
the
railways
are
irreparably
injured
if
they
are
committed
to
collect
lawful
rates,
other
people
maybe
irreparably
injured,
even
though
they
have
actions
at
law
if
the
railroads
do
collect
rates
which
are
later
held
to
be
unlawful,
shall
we
divide
this
by
dividing
the
time
that
the
rates
shall
be
in
suspension?
now
this
was
the
argument
before
the
congress.
this
is
what
they
discussed
and
in
the
act
of
1910,
this
battle
went
back
and
forth
and
the
legislative
history
is
all
directed
to
this
question.
and
you
see
first
of
all
the
insurgents
putting
in
amendments
which
would
say
no
rate
is
lawful
until
the
commission
has
said
it's
lawful.
these
were
defeated.
then
the
stalwarts
begin
to
offer
concessions.
they
at
first
said,
“two
months
suspension.”
then
they
said,
“well,
we're
going
to
double
that,
four
months
suspension”
and
the
insurgents
had
enough
votes
to
beat
that
off.
and
finally,
you
--
there
was
a
compromise
made
by
saying
the
commission
may
suspend
for
four
months,
but
if
that
isn't
enough
time
they
may
have
six
months
more,
but
the
principle
was
established
that
there
should
be
an
end
at
some
not,
an
end
fixed
by
congress
of
the
period
of
suspension.
in
the
transportation
act
of
1920,
this
period
of
ten
months,
four
months
plus
six
months
were
shortened
to
five
months.
now,
five
months
proved
to
be
too
short.
in
the
act
of
1927,
the
period
was
then
extended
to
one
lump
sum
of
--
one
long
period
of
seven
months.
but
i
suggest
that
reason
box
at
the
thought
that
all
of
this
debate,
all
of
this
struggle
between
intelligent,
earnest,
convinced
men
was
only
a
pillow
fight
that
there
was
no
reality
in
it
at
all.
because
these
men
were
so
stupid
that
they
did
not
know
unbeknownst
to
them
whatever
period
they
might
agree
on
that
the
commission
should
suspend
that
they
were
giving
power
to
the
courts
to
step
in
afterwards
and
continue
the
suspension
until
the
commission
should
decide.
this
i
think
denigrates
men
who
are
worthy
of
better
treatment
admits.
these
men
thought
they
were
fighting
and
indeed
they
were
fighting
about
a
principle
and
about
a
real
issue.
can
you
say
that
they
weren't
at
all
--
that
was
all
a
lot
of
foolish
business
back
and
forth
is
to
how
long
the
commission
should
be
able
to
suspend
where
the
courts
always
lurking
in
the
background,
able
to
complete
the
suspension.
this
i
think
is
completely
to
abnegate
history.
there
aren't
many
occasions
as
clear
as
this,
if
the
court
please,
where
a
very
considerable
battle
appears
clearly
on
the
page
of
statute,
here
it
is,
right
on
the
statute
itself.
i
know
of
only
--
of
the
--
one
other
case
where
it's
as
clear
as
this
which
is
not
without
its
illustrated
interest.
sir
john
neil
talks
about
the
first
elizabeth's
battle
with
the
congress
and
with
the
parliament
of
1559
on
the
issue
of
the
british
prayer
book.
this
was
a
battle
which
nearly
upset
the
tudor
regime
in
england
and
it
was
compromised
around
a
colony.
it's
compromised
in
that
part
of
the
preamble
in
the
eucharist,
in
the
double
sentences
separated
by
a
colon
in
which
the
bread
and
wine
are
administered.
sir
john
points
out
that
the
first
one
of
these
sentences
is
the
prayer
book
of
panama,
the
catholic
doctrine,
the
real
presence
then
at
the
end
is
a
colon.
the
second
sentence
is
swiss
reformation
doctrine.
these
two
about
which
the
queen
and
the
divines
were
battling
were
put
together
and
separated
by
a
comma
and
here
in
that
one
page
of
the
prayer
book,
you'll
find
the
great
issue
of
the
early
days
of
queen
elizabeth,
an
issue
which
might
have
divided
england
and
overthrown
the
queen,
here
it
is
now
unnoticed
by
anybody
because
it's
sanctified
by
centuries
of
usage.
so
it's
true
here,
your
honor.
on
this
statute,
in
which
my
learned
friend
says
all
he
can
conclude
is
that
the
congress
wished
to
toss
this
question
into
the
lap
of
the
court.
nothing
is
further
from
the
historical
fact
in
there.
that
congress
had
no
idea
of
tossing
this
issue
into
the
lap
of
the
courts.
it
had
every
thought
it
was
deciding
it
itself
and
deciding
it
after
a
tremendous
battle
and
there,
the
act
of
1910
is
an
issue
of
a
great
battle
in
the
congress
over
this
very
question.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes
sir.
mr.
dean
acheson
your
honor,
may
i
reply
at
a
little
length
into
that
question?
this
general
matter
is
discussed
in
the
statute,
and
it
says
that
a
three-judge
court
created
after
an
order
of
the
commission
and
only
a
three-judge
court
has
authority
to
issue
interlocutory
or
final
orders,
a
final
injunction
regarding
orders
of
the
commission.
its
jurisdiction
relates
to
orders
of
the
commission.
obviously,
under
that
statute
it
can
issue
a
temporary
restraining
order,
interlocutory
injunction
or
any
other
kind
of
injunction
against
an
order.
now,
orders
of
the
commission
have
different
effects.
an
order
of
the
commission
saying
these
rates
are
illegal
makes
these
rates
illegal.
therefore,
the
court
enjoins
that
down
the
--
the
injunction
is
lifted.
they
do
no
along
this
--
i
mean
the
order
is
lifted,
they
do
no
longer
--
if
however,
the
order
of
the
commission
says
these
rates
are
lawful,
the
rates
are
in
effect
and
lawfully
in
effect
under
the
15
(7),
the
commission
nearly
confirms
what
was
true
anyway,
and
does
not
make
the
rates
unlawful.
therefore,
strictly
answering
your
question
on
a
purely
logical
statutory
basis,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no.
they
do
not
have
and
are
not
given
the
authority
to
enjoin
rates
but
only
order
the
commission,
but
that
really
doesn't
answer
your
--
to
your
question
because
it
all
depends
what
the
commission
does
and
what
the
courts
do.
if
the
court
issues
an
order
saying
that
we
for
various
reasons
want
to
enjoin
your
order
and
we
think
that
you've
omitted
something
or
you've
taken
a
wrong
view
and
therefore,
we
order
you
or
ask
you
or
direct
you
to
set
aside
--
have
a
new
hearing
on
these
rates
then,
the
commission
will
start
doing
something
which
will
put
the
railroad
in
a
wholly
different
position.
and
if
the
railroad
is
then
told
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
has
views
which
are
very
likely
put
the
railroad
in
serious
trouble
if
it
goes
ahead,
it
is
quite
likely
not
to
go
ahead
for
the
commission
may
take
it
up
with
the
railroad.
there's
a
great
--
this
is
not
done
really
on
a
strictly
--
on
its
length
basis.
the
railroad
must
look
out
for
what
it
sees
ahead
of
itself,
and
the
commission
has
great
power
to
tell
the
railroad
that
it
would
be
wise
if
it
filed
a
new
tariff
not
putting
this
in
effect
until
after
its
final
judgment.
that
is
about
the
way
this
thing
works.
now,
your
honors
if
i
may
go
on
a
little
longer,
the
petitioner's
argument
is
one
which
i
think
is
quite
easy
to
understand.
the
government's
argument,
i've
already
pointed
out,
presents
grave
difficulties
as
to
the
framing
of
the
injunction.
the
government's
argument
also
presents
grave
difficulties
as
to
the
statement
of
the
rule
which
it
is
urging
upon
this
court.
it's
already
been
pointed
out
by
justice
goldberg
that
this
is
a
--
of
novel
standard.
this
is
a
standard
that
we
are
not
familiar
with
in
the
law.
this
is
not
a
standard
of
irreparable
injury,
one
of
some
kind
of
additional
injury,
where
does
this
come
from.
there's
no
indication
that
anybody
in
the
congress
was
ever
thinking
of
any
such
idea
as
this
at
any
time
during
the
debate
on
the
statute.
this
is
not
a
distillation
of
congressional
thought.
as
i
say
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history.
there's
nothing
in
the
history
of
equitable
remedy
which
indicates
this
super,
super
standard.
in
order
to
state
this,
what
i
think
almost
defy
legal
draftsmanship,
i
wouldn't
know
if
i
were
asked
to
amend
the
statute
to
bring
into
it
with
the
idea
given
us
by
the
government.
i
wouldn't
know
how
to
go
about
this
drafting
job.
it
would
be
a
complete
rewriting
of
the
statute,
but
then
the
government
says
it
is
not
shown
that
in
determining
the
language
which
congress
adopted,
it
foresaw
the
sort
of
injury
that
the
government
is
talking
about.
this
i
submit
to
the
court
is
a
new
type
of
legislative
history
and
use.
it
is
true
that
when
a
language
of
the
congress
is
absolutely
clear
and
there's
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
congress
meant
just
what
it
said
that
anyone
can
show
50
years
later
that
a
case
comes
along
which
the
congress
did
not
foresee
when
it
used
this
plain
language,
that
the
plain
language
must
be
changed.
i
have
never
heard
of
legislative
history
being
used
in
this
way.
the
language
is
plain.
it
does
not
permit
this
error.
there's
no
evidence
that
anyone
ever
considered
this
standard.
in
other
words,
a
standard
made
out
of
thin
air
is
now
introduced
to
deal
with
what
is
taught
to
be
a
particular
case
and
the
only
thing
that
i
think
this
effort
the
government
attributes
to
this
case
is
to
underline
the
error
of
the
petitioner's
position.
both
--
may
i
pass
to
another
point
about
the
petitioner
and
the
government
in
their
briefs?
refer
to
section
22
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
preserved
common
law
remedies
when
this
common
law
remedies
are
not
inconsistent
with
the
act.
now,
neither
the
government
nor
the
petitioners
spell
out
what
they
mean
by
this
and
indeed
i'm
not
able
to
spell
it
out
either
because
we
have
already
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
suit
at
common
law
by
someone
alleging
injury
from
a
rate
which
is
too
low.
common
law
remedies
are
against
rates
which
are
too
high
or
discriminatory.
the
thrust
of
this
case
is
clearly
that
the
rates
are
too
low.
if
it
is
said
that
the
rates
are
discriminatory,
then
i
answer
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
commission's
finding
about
discrimination
at
all.
it
deals
only
about
unjust
and
unlawful
rates
which
means
the
rate
is
too
high
or
rates
which
contravene
the
national
transportation
policy.
well,
now
that
isn't
the
common
law
remedy.
surely,
this
equitable
remedy
of
preserving
the
status
quo,
pending
a
decision
of
another
judicial
or
administrative
body,
this
is
not
a
common
law
remedy.
i
just
fail
to
see
what
our
opponents
are
driving
at.
there
is
one
other
idea
which
is
related
in
a
way
to
what
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
me
a
moment
ago.
in
both
the
government
and
the
petitioner's
brief
or
probably
in
the
government's
brief,
there
are
two
suggestions
that
the
intervention
of
the
courts
is
necessary
to
preserve,
i
use
this
word,
to
preserve
or
to
make
effective,
the
judgment
first
of
the
commission
or
then
of
a
three-judge
court.
is
it
different
from
what
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
me
a
moment
ago?
in
the
government's
brief
on
page
19
to
20
they
say,
“after
these
allegations
are
legit,
the
barge
lines
are
driven
out
of
business
before
the
commission
could
rule
upon
the
lawfulness
of
the
rates,
the
commission
will
be
rendered
powerless
to
grab
effective
relief
or
to
carry
out
the
declared
policy
of
congress
and
the
outcome
of
a
bitterly
contested
economic
controversy
in
which
an
important
public
interest
is
at
stake
will
be
determined
not
by
the
responsible
agency
applying
a
statutory
criterion
but
by
the
force
of
circumstances.”
now,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
nothing
of
that
sort
is
even
remotely
possible.
the
commission
is
not
rendered
ineffective
nor
is
it
--
its
judgment
rendered
ineffective
depending
upon
the
economic
situation
of
certain
plaintiffs
before
a
district
court.
there
are
vast
interests
before
the
commission.
the
commission
will
render
its
order.
its
order
will
be
effective
when
rendered.
there's
no
danger
of
circumstances
and
not
the
commission
deciding
this
case.
the
commission
will
decide
it
and
can
decide
it,
and
thousands
of
people
who
will
be
affected
one
way
or
the
other
will
still
be
there
to
be
affected
by
the
commissioners
--
commission's
decisions.
mr.
dean
acheson
quite
right
but
that
is
not
the
point
which
is
made,
your
honor.
that
is
not
the
point
which
is
made.
there
are
two
points
here.
one
is
that
great
danger
to
a
person.
the
other
one
is
that
to
preserve
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission.
this
is
necessary.
that
is
not
true.
similarly,
it
is
not
true
that
a
three-judge
court
might
be
convened
before
as
the
government
says
again
on
page
20
of
its
brief,
they
don't
altogether
foreclose
the
thought
that
if
a
three-judge
court
might
be
convened
in
advance
of
the
decision
of
the
commission
to
preserve
its
jurisdiction.
now,
that's
on
page
20
justice
goldberg,
in
the
footnote.
now,
you
don't
need
to
preserve
the
jurisdiction
of
the
three-judge
court
by
any
such
performances
there.
in
the
first
place
there
cannot
be
a
three-judge
court
until
there
is
an
order
for
them
to
review.
this
is
clear
in
the
statute
that
the
three-judge
court
reviews
orders
of
the
commission.
there
being
no
order,
there
is
no
authority
to
convene
a
three-judge
court.
but
even
if
there
were,
it
is
necessary
to
preserve
its
jurisdiction.
the
commission
is
there.
the
railroads
are
there,
everybody
is
--
in
the
southeast
is
there,
there's
no
question
that
the
judgment
of
the
three-judge
court
would
be
affected.
well
now
--
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
it
was
entirely
consistent
with
the
plain
words
of
the
act.
mr.
dean
acheson
i
think
the
act
is
supposed
to
do
exactly
what
it
says
on
the
statute,
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dean
acheson
what
is
says,
the
rates
shall
go
into
effect.
i
think
they
mean
that
they
shall
go
in
with
effect.
mr.
dean
acheson
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
regulate
commerce
and
to
regulate
rates.
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
not
to
keep
everybody
in
business,
who
is
in
business
now.
mr.
dean
acheson
now,
your
honor
asked
me
a
highly
theoretical
question
as
to
whether
if
certain
people
were
then
put
out
of
business.
mr.
dean
acheson
this
would
be
contrary
to
general
public
policy.
and
my
answer
is
no.
mr.
dean
acheson
i
would
agree,
your
honor
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
protect
or
at
one
purpose
or
a
purpose
is
to
protect
people
from
unlawful
rates
in
the
manner
suggested
by
the
act
and
not
a
general
--
mr.
dean
acheson
that
--
your
honor,
may
i
perhaps
make
it
clearer
in
this
way.
i
would
say
first
of
all
that
the
highly
theoretical
character
of
your
question
makes
it
difficult
for
me
to
[inaudible]
mr.
dean
acheson
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
have
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dean
acheson
i
know
sir.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes.
mr.
dean
acheson
what
the
commission
--
what
the
commission
--
what
the
lower
court
found,
what
the
act
talks
about
is
irreparable
injury.
now,
the
act
balances
the
irreparable
injury
of
the
railroad
against
the
irreparable
injury
of
other
people.
mr.
dean
acheson
no,
before
there's
any
finding
at
all,
your
honor.
it
says,
pending
the
decision
of
the
commission,
the
railroad
shall
suffer
irreparable
injury.
mr.
dean
acheson
yes,
sir.
that's
just
what
it
says.
they
couldn't
--
mr.
dean
acheson
it
says
the
commission
may
suspend
the
rate
for
up
to
seven
months.
during
that
time
it
may
not
charge
rates
which
may
be
right.
mr.
dean
acheson
i
am
sure
they
might
be
unlawful
and
therefore,
in
your
case
they
might
be
lawful
also.
mr.
dean
acheson
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
that
rates
which
maybe
lawful
or
maybe
unlawful.
nobody
knows
which
they
are
going
to
be
until
the
commission
decides.
during
that
period
the
act
says
the
railroads
must
take
the
risk
that
they
will
be
irreparably
damaged
for
seven
months,
everybody
other
that
the
railroads
must
take
their
risks
for
the
rest
of
the
time.
now,
this
is
the
congressional
scheme.
mr.
dean
acheson
plain
language
of
the
act
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dean
acheson
the
plain
language
of
the
act
is
at
the
end
of
such
period
the
rates
shall
go
into
effect.
mr.
dean
acheson
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
i
tried
to
point
out
that
for
centuries
this
jurisdiction
has
not
been
exercised
in
this
regard.
mr.
dean
acheson
did
not
been
able
to
decide
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
dean
acheson
not
in
this
case
it
happened.
not
before
1910
was
it
done,
not
since
1910
has
it
been
done.
there
are
few
lower
federal
courts
that
attempted
to
do
this
and
the
great
chief
justice
mr.
hughes
said
that
the
weight
of
authority
was
against
their
doing
it.
mr.
dean
acheson
mr.
hughes
in
the
great
northern
case.
mr.
dean
acheson
he
said
in
that
case
that
the
weight
of
authority
before
1910
was
that
these
federal
courts
did
not
have
the
authority
to
enjoin
the
rates.
so
that
i
say
this
act
has
not
been
exercised
for
a
hundred
years.
now,
which
you
say
to
me
that
--
mr.
dean
acheson
that
i
do
not
have
in
mind,
but
i
think
i
have
already
trespassed
too
long
on
the
time
of
the
court
and
if
my
opponents
have
any
time
i
would
wish
them
to
have
it
this
afternoon.
ending
up
solely
with
the
statement
again,
that
before
the
commission
exercises
its
power
to
decide,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
congress
meant
to
give
or
gave
or
should
have
--
maybe
thought
about
it
again,
power
to
a
court
to
intervene
into
the
ratemaking
procedure
in
order
to
weigh
equities
which
it
cannot
weigh
at
all.
