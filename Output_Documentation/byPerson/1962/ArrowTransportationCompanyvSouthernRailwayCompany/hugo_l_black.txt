you

how
long
has

no,
oi

why
would

[inaudible],
it's
alright
you
don't
--
justice

do
you
not
refer
mr.
spritzer
to
the
allegations
in
connection
with
this
application
of
the
antitrust
[inaudible]?
do
you
think
it
has
anything
to
do
with
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
court
has
held
at
the
antitrust
law
provides
for
railroads.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
i
think
we
held
it
applies
so
far
as
your
view
was
concerned
representing
the
interest
of
private
suitors?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
there
--
if
there
were
conspiracy
to
--
part
of
the
railroad
could
be
filed
together
the
fixed
rates
to
get
in
effect
--
temporarily
to
take
advantage
of
a
lap
--
gap
in
the
law
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
to
put
them
out
of
business,
would
that
not
charge
antitrust
violations?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
was
just
asking
if
the
government
has
taken
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
assume
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
assume
of
those
allegations
have
shown
if
proven
in
violation
of
some
federal
law
that
was
applicable
to
the
party
that
would
have
some
bearing
on
whether
the
suit
would
lie,
would
it
not,
even
with
reference
to
the
15
(7)?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
question
that
the
commission
will
have
to
decide,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
that
been
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
that
been
done?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
weigh
--
equities
they
weigh
were
or
was
there,
at
least
to
the
equities
outweighs
of
whether
the
allegations,
sufficient
reason
to
believe
that
the
allegations
were
true
as
if
indicated
they
were
that
this
rate
would
be
below
cost
to
the
railroads
that
they
were
doing
or
putting
them
on
for
the
purpose
of
destroying
and
would
destroy
the
barge
lines
if
some
action
were
not
taken.
that
is
quite
different,
isn't
it
to
who
should
ultimately
decide
whether
that
charge
is
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
are
the
courts
incapable
of
weighing
the
equities
assuming
the
allegations
are
true
which
as
i
recall
the
railroads
have
not
denied,
that
these
rates
will
put
these
barge
lines
completely
out
of
business
if
the
thing
is
not
suspended.
why
--
why
a
court
is
not
able
to
weigh
that
equity?
i'm
not
talking
about
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that'll
eventually
be
the
rate,
that's
a
different
thing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
did
the
railroad
deny
that
this
would
put
the
truck
line
--
the
bus
--
barge
lines
out
of
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
have
--
you
had
the
trial
at
least
by
affidavit
before
the
district
court
and
you
presented
affidavits
and
they
did,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
court
reached
an
opposite
conclusion,
didn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
--
what
was
that
based
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
based
on
what
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
not
the
affidavit
cite
that
would
put
some
out
of
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
basis
for
the
charge
that
would
inflict
the
irreparable
damage,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo

black
district
courts
found
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
the
district
court
found
that
will
inflict
irreparable
damage.
is
this
by
rights?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
commission
were
to
decide
that
these
rates
are
unlawful
and
in
the
meantime
these
petitioners
have
been
destroyed,
another
barge
line,
would
you
say
that
was
consistent
with
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
act
is
supposed
to
further
a
national
railroad
system,
people
able
to
operate
not
being
squeezed
out
by
rates
that
are
unlawful,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
its
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they're
later
found
to
be
unlawful,
you
say
that
the
--
no
injury
would
be
done
to
the
purpose
of
the
act
if
they
are
found
to
be
unlawful
and
in
the
meantime,
several
people
have
been
put
out
of
business
by
rate
that
required
people
to
compete
for
getting
three
cents
a
ton
or
carry
in
freight?
i
don't
quite
understand
your
argument
on
this.
why
are
you
saying
that,
that
that
would
not
frustrate
purpose
of
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
say
general
public
policy.
i
said
the
policy
of
that
act
which
is
to
protect
those
engaged
in
commerce
from
unlawful
depredations
by
others
engaged
in
that
commerce.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
gets
back
to
the
interpretation.
i
understand
your
argument
on
the
interpretation
of
section
7,
but
i
don't
understand
the
argument
on
what
you
have
to
establish
it
that
there
was
--
the
act
was
--
the
purpose
would
be
fully
carried
out.
if
unlawful
rates
were
put
in
effect
which
resulted
in
the
destruction
of
a
number
of
people
engaged
in
the
interstate
commerce
who
were
supposed
to
be
protected
from
unlawful
depredations,
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
say
--
i
finally
understand
that
because
those
are
the
allegations
of
the
bill.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
to
a
certain
extent
was
the
conclusions
reached
by
the
commission
on
its
primary
looking
at
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
after
rates
are
found
lawful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
it
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
there
might
not
be
irreparable
injury,
but
the
(voice

--
legal
entry
because
they
might
be
unlawful.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
say
it
have
a
--
why
does
it
--
you
keep
saying
that
the
plain
language
of
the
act
forbids
court
action
to
protect
people
against
irreparable
injury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
the
plain
language
that
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
says
nothing
at
all
about
the
problem
they
had
in
mind
as
to
whether
if
those
rates
going
in
effect,
the
court
shall
forego
that
the
--
one
of
the
great
parts
of
their
jurisdiction
is
exercised
for
centuries
to
prevent
irreparable
damages
from
unlawful
conduct.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
thought
that
way
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
i
was
talking
about
the
irreparable
damages,
irreparable
injuries,
wrongful
injuries?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
said
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
judge
riffkin's
case?
