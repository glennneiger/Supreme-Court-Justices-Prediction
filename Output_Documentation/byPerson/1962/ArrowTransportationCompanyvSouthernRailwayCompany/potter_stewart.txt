me
briefly,

justice

justice

would
grain

matter
what
quantity?
justice

stewart
and
the
$3.12
is
applicable
--
the
rates
that
you
had
so
much
urged
applicable
only
in
large
quantities?

but
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
how
much
is
450
tons
in
terms
of
railroad
cars?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
a
whole
train.
justice
potter
stewart
the
one

this
has
to
be
the
one
consignee?
justice
potter
stewart
this
has
to
be
the
one-to-one
consignee?
justice
potter
stewart
or
one
shipment
rate.
which
is
the
test
one
shipper
or
one
consignee?
justice
potter
stewart
both?
justice
potter
stewart
the
present
barge
rail
rate
of
$5.48
and
through
the
--
one
of
the
two
components
that
$2.20?
justice
potter
stewart
from
guntersville
to
birmingham?
justice
potter
stewart
those
were
the
three
components.
yes,
i
missed
the
transfer
charges.
justice
potter
stewart
does
arrow
carry
any
other
commodity
except
grain?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
fairly
typical
of
the
traffic
down
the
tennessee
river,
that
80%
of
its
grain?
justice
potter
stewart
grain
carrier.
justice
potter
stewart
this
grain
--
eventually
most
of
it
ends
up
--
be
fed
to
chickens,
does
it
in
southern
(inaudible)?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
carry
--
does
the
rail
carriers
to
the
southern
and
the
other
rail
carriers
filed
bonds
or
other
privatized
filed
bonds
on
these
rates
for
the
new
thing?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
they've
been
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
the
general
practice
in
your
state
county?
justice
potter
stewart
but
for
seven
months
only?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
after
there's
a,
there's
a
correlative
right
of
the
carrier
i
suppose
with
the
rate
from
the
effects
subject
only
to
section
8
and
whatever
else
there
maybe
if
the
rates
turn
out
to
be
unlawful.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
you
are
right,
the
court
can
adjourn?
justice
potter
stewart
its
clear
isn't
it
that
if
--
well,
if
and
when
the
commission
decides
that
this
present
case
before
us
now
will
be
moot
or
(voice

justice
potter
stewart
wouldn't
it
reviewable
by
a
three-judge
court?
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
not
filed
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
brief
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
not
allowed
to
without
the
permission
of
the
solicitor
general,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
were
--
if
there
were
no
--
now,
the
commission
has
creature
of
statute
--
if
there
were
no
commission,
that
there
were
no
interstate
commerce
act,
would
the
court
have
power
--
would
the
court
have
power
to
enjoin
these
rates,
you
think?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
there
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
know
that's
--
i
know
that
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
stating
the
question
a
different
way.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
statute
is
clear
that
after
seven
months
the
rates
go
into
effect
and
so
you
have
to
rely
on
something
beyond
the
statute,
different
from
the
statute.
and
i'm
now
asking
if
there
were
no
statutes
which
we
--
would
there
be
power,
would
there
be
a
power
(inaudible)
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
enjoin
this
[inaudible]
--
justice
potter
stewart
might
have
standing,
be
free
from
unfair
competition
but
that
had
quite
a
different
meaning
as
we
both
know.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
there
was
or
it's
going
to
be
apparent
consensus
upon
the
proposition
that
the
act
did
not
destroy
any
power
that
the
court
might
already
have.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
well,
that
brings
in
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
that
brings
me
back
in
my
mind
at
least
to
the
other
question
as
to
the
--
my
other
question
as
to
what
power
would
the
court
have
if
there
were
no
interstate
commerce
act
in
this
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
statutory
rights
that
are
being
asserted
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
can't
be
a
--
as
i
understood
the
co-counsel,
section
8
has
never
have
been
successfully
utilized.
is
that
an
overstatement?
did
i
misunderstand
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
are
away
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
suggests
adding
a
new
equitable
test,
not
irreparable
damage
but
extremely
irreparable
damage
or
something
like
that?
justice
potter
stewart
absolutely
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
like
the
no
smoking
sign,
whether
it
says
no
smoking
or
positively
no
smoking?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
i'm
trying
to
understand
was
in
the
--
your
argument
as
i
do
understand
it
is
that
in
the
ordinary
case
which
absent
all
these
problems
might
be
one
for
the
exercise
of
equitable
jurisdiction
an
injunction
should
not
issue.
it's
only
in
the
ex

extremely
extraordinary

justice

balancing
the
equity
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
has
the

under
the
securities
act
of
1933,
is
there
any
time
limitation
of
commission's
power,
securities
exchange
commission's
power
to
hold
up
the
registration
fee?
do
you
happen
to
know?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't,
i'm
just
asking
for
information.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
fair
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
only
--
that
the
people
who
were
damaged
would
be
shippers
not
competitors?
justice
potter
stewart
in
any
event
mr.
acheson,
a
private
party
can't
get
an
injunction
under
the
antitrust
laws,
isn't
it?

only

justice
potter

a
private
party
cannot
get
an
injunction
under
the
antitrust
laws
in
any
event,
even
assuming
a
violation,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
potter

only
the
government
can
get
injunctive
(voice

--
justice
potter

a
private
party
is

damages.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
acheson.
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
the
order
of
your
argument
and
this
may
or
may
not
be
relevant
but
this
question
has
occurred
to
me.
after
the
icc
makes
it's
a
final
determination
in
this
case
then
of
course
there's
the
possibility
of
a
review
by
a
three-judge
statutory
district
court.
would
such
a
court
have
power
to
enjoin
the
effect
of
the
sec's
order,
pending
decision
on
the
merits,
is
that
ever
been
decided?
