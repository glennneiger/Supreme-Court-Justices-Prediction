is
the
season
when
the
shipping
is
heavier
or
what?
justice
tom
c.
clark
not
just
--
not
geared
to
the

justice

[inaudible]
--
you
haven't
heard
anything

now
that
would
expedite
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
let's
see
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
get
around
that
in
the
arrow
case?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
they
held
it
up,
and
ask
to
be
passed
on
it,
and

passed
on
it,
asserted
by
the
fact?

[inaudible]

[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
don't
understand
there.
i
thought
the
--
originally
the
court
issued
an
injunction
enjoining
the
commission
from
vacating
its
orders
which
they'd
already
done
apparently,
i
thought.
then
they
dissolved
that
injunction
and
told
the
commission
that
they
had
like
--
they're
going
to
hold
it
up
until
its
--
just
quite
a
time
and
they
hope
it
would
be
able
to
pass
on
it,
but
if
--
is
that
right?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
they
passed
on
it
and
a
court
said,
“well,
can
go
ahead
now”,
and
went
on
to
decide
it.
that's
a
three-judge
court?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
held
this
in
other
cases?
