that
the
buffalo
savings
bank
case
that
if
the
mortgagee
had
immediately
prior
to
sale
paid
delinquent
local
taxes
and
added
it
to
the
mortgage,
your
argument
would
be
that
that's
part
of
the
mortgage,
secured
by
the
mortgage
and
the
federal
lien
must
give
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
mortgage
for
example
provide
that
the
mortgagee
may
pay
delinquent
taxes
if
it
wants
to
and
added
it
to
the
mortgage?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wouldn't
you
claim
--
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
you
claim
--
wouldn't
you
claim
that
if
the
mortgagee
did
so
that
those
amounts
are
added
to
the
lien
and
have
priority
over
the
federal
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
buffalo
saving
didn't
involve
--
when
the
liens
became
choate
to
the
--
when
it
claims
to
be
choate.
and
that
certainly
is
involved
in
this
case,
but
when
your
claim
for
the
attorney's
fee
that
it
became
--
it
became
choate
or
part
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
think
its
choate
prior
--
why
do
you
think
it
was
choate
prior
to
the
time
the
government
filed
that
lien?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
by
the
filing
of
the
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
at
the
time
the
government's
lien
was
filed,
could
you
tell
that,
could
you
have
told
anyone
about
the
attorney's
fee
was
going
to
be
in
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
simply
the
maximum
but
it
wasn't
the
--
they
might
not
have
gotten
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
as
of
the
date
the
federal
tax
lien
was
filed,
no
attorney's
fee
result
to
anybody,
but
the
court
has
to
order
its
payment.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
obligation
to
pay
the
fee
wasn't
settled
either
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
--
but
you
couldn't
have
sued
for
an
attorney's
fee
on
that
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
have
been
subject
to
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
case
of
being
choate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
--
do
you
think
the
government
would
take
the
same
position
if
their
lien
was
filed
after
the
--
let's
assume
that
there'd
been
a
--
its
lien
was
filed
at
a
time
after
the
amount
of
attorney's
fees
had
been
definitely
settled
and
order
to
be
paid?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
can?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
not
if
--
let's
still
assume
that
there's
going
to
be
an
attorney's
fee
and
even
if
they
kept
literally
what
you
said.
you
don't
how
much
it's
going
to
be
or
you
don't
know
whether
there's
going
to
be
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
but
after
the
foreclosure
--
but
at
that
point
it
maybe
there
won't
be
any
attorney's
fee.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
court
awards
one,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
the
time
the
--
but
at
the
time
the
federal
lien
attaches
to
the
interest
of
the
taxpayer,
you
say
that
its
interest
has
already
been
diminished
by
the
attorney's
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it
is,
and
still
it
is
determined,
the
taxpayer
has
that
interest
in
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
if
the
property's
worth
a
$100,000
and
the
loan
on
it
is
$50,000
and
there's
a
10%
attorney's
fee
provision
in
the
mortgage.
your
position
is
that
the
day
after
the
mortgage
is
executed
and
delivered
and
recorded,
the
owner's
interest
is
$50,000,
not
45.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
the
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment
the
arkansas
law
is
contrary
that
the
--
that
under
arkansas
law,
the
interest
of
the
property
owner
was
only
$45,000
the
day
after
the
mortgage
was
filed
and
recorded
simply
because
there's
a
10%
reservation
attorney's
fee
which
becomes
part
of
the
mortgage
under
arkansas
law.
it's
like
a
debt.
do
you
still
say
that
you
can
get
off
the
hook
by
an
argument
about
choateness?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
state
tax
is
one
part
of
the
mortgage,
no
one
contended
they
were.
