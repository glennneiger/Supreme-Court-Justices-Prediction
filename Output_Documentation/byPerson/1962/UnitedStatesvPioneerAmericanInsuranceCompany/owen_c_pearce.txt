mr.
owen
c.
pearce
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
to
the
vague
statement
of
facts
that
mr.
roberts
gave
out,
i
would
like
to
add
some
facts
particularly
dealing
with
what
we
contend
as
the
contract
under
which
we
have
the
rest
that
we
claim
in
this
case.
on
page
7
of
the
record
appears
the
provision
concerning
the
attorney's
fee.
it
reads
that
the
undersigned
also
agrees
that
in
the
event
of
default
herein
and
of
the
placing
of
this
note
in
the
hands
of
an
attorney
for
collection
or
this
note
is
collected
through
any
court
proceedings
to
pay
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
now,
we
feel
it's
also
an
important
part
of
the
facts,
that
the
statute
providing
for
attorney's
fees
was
part
of
the
arkansas
law
at
this
time
and
had
been
since
1951.
also
that
this
attorney's
fee
is
not
unlimited
but
it
is
limited
to
the
extent
of
10%
of
the
principal
and
the
accrued
interest
at
the
time
that
the
award
is
made.
now,
we
feel
that
there
are
three
provisions
which
adequately
care
for
the
attorney's
fees
and
the
mortgage.
on
page
12
of
the
record,
right
at
the
top
of
the
page,
it's
provided
that
the
party
of
the
third
part
who
is
the
mortgagee,
may
also
pay
any
other
sum
that
is
necessary
to
protect
the
security
of
this
instrument.
all
such
sums
as
well
as
the
costs
paid
by
the
party
of
the
third
part
pursuant
to
this
instrument
shall
be
secured
hereby.
the
second
provision
in
the
mortgage,
which
the
deals
with
the
matter
of
the
attorney's
fee,
and
was
mentioned
by
mr.
roberts;
on
page
13
of
the
record,
i
would
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
fact
that
in
--
toward
the
end
of
the
paragraph
the
word
“to”
was
changed
by
stipulation
of
the
parties
from
the
first
printed
record
to
read
by.
so
that
this
provision
now
reads
as
follows
leaving
up
the
unimportant
words,
that
if
the
party
of
the
first
part
shall
become
a
party
to
any
suit
or
proceeding
at
law
or
in
equity
in
reference
to
its
interest
in
the
premises
herein
conveyed,
the
attorney's
fees
in
such
suit
or
proceeding
shall
be
added
to
the
principal
sum
then
owing
by
the
party
of
the
first
part
and
shall
be
secured
by
this
instrument.
finally,
for
the
third
provision
of
the
mortgage
which
deals
with
the
matter
of
attorney's
fees,
page
14
of
the
record
toward
the
middle
of
the
page,
it's
stated
the
application
of
the
proceeds
of
the
foreclosure
sale.
it
says
that
the
proceeds
of
any
sale
under
this
deed
of
trust
shall
be
applied
by
the
party
of
the
second
part
as
follows.
first;
to
pay
the
cost
and
expenses
of
executing
this
trust
and
--
and
it
goes
ahead
and
mentions
attorney's
fees
and
then
down
to
the
third
item;
to
pay
off
the
debt
secured
hereby,
including
accrued
interest
thereon;
and
last,
to
pay
the
balance,
if
any,
to
the
party
of
the
first
part
or
the
mortgagors.
i
shall
address
myself
to
three
propositions.
first,
that
the
mortgagee
is
a
protected
category
under
26
u.s.
code
6323,
and
that
the
court
in
its
principle
should
not
be
applied
in
this
case
to
deprive
the
mortgagee
of
an
important
right
that
he
has
acquired
by
a
contract
and
as
a
result
of
the
provisions
that
i
just
outlined.
secondly,
that
the
attorney's
fee
is
just
as
choate
as
other
items
which
the
government
admits
to
be
choate
dealing
with
the
amount,
there
is
no
question
as
to
the
identity
of
the
lienor
or
the
--
the
identity
of
the
property
and
thirdly,
that
the
result
contended
for
by
the
government
is
unjust
to
lenders.
now,
as
a
background
that
concerned
the
court
in
this
rule,
i
think
that
we
have
to
consider
what
the
law
was
from
the
year
of
1866,
when
the
statute
was
first
enacted
establishing
the
federal
tax
lien
up
to
the
year
1913.
this
provision
is
now
26
u.s.
code
6321.
it
provides
simply
that
when
one
fails
to
pay
a
tax
after
demands
that
the
amount
of
the
tax
shall
be
a
lien
upon
all
the
property
of
the
taxpayer
and
the
matter
of
recording
under
this
statute
was
not
dealt
with
and
it
is
not
important.
if
there
are
tax
liens
in
new
york
then
if
there
were
mortgage
placed
to
record,
and
in
arkansas
even
though
there
was
no
recording,
the
tax
lien
still
was
a
good
lien
between
the
years
1866
and
1913.
in
the
year
1913
was
enacted
section
6323
which
provides
in
substance
that
the
liens
shall
not
be
valid
as
against
any
mortgagee,
clergy,
purchaser
or
judgment
creditors.
now
most
of
the
cases,
now
we
contend
all
but
two
cases,
the
new
britain
case
and
the
buffalo
savings
bank
case,
dealt
with
local
liens
of
one
count
or
another
but
not
with
mortgage
liens,
such
things
as
labor
or
material
liens,
attachment
liens,
garnishment
liens,
the
landlord
liens.
the
old
law
was
the
law
of
the
first
in
time
as
a
first
in
arrival
that's
--
that's
still
the
law
but
this
was
a
basic
to
the
law
between
1866
and
1913.
and
because
of
that,
it
became
necessary
to
make
some
determination
as
to
when
these
local
liens
became
perfect
or
fixed,
or
determined,
so
they
could
be
determined
which
of
these
came
first;
the
federal
lien
or
the
local
lien.
however,
in
1913,
when
section
6323
was
passed,
it
gave
protection
to
these
four
categories
that
i
mentioned,
mortgagees,
pledgees,
purchasers
of
judgment
creditors
and
the
word
mortgagee
was
not
qualified
in
the
statutes.
now
the
choate
test,
we
contend
has
not
been
applied
to
mortgagees.
a
mentioned
was
made
of
the
ball
case.
this
involved
an
unrecorded
assignments
and
through
the
four
dissenting
judges
on
this
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
in
texas,
it
was
considered
to
be
a
mortgage
and
it
was
felt
that
the
state
law
should
be
given
some
consideration,
but
the
majority
opinion
was
a
very
brief
opinion
which
simply
reversed
this
case
stating
that
this
lien
was
inchoate
and
unperfected.
there
was
some
discussion
in
this
case
about
the
fact
that
the
assignment
had
not
been
recorded
under
certain
fraudulent
conveyance
statutes
of
the
state
of
texas.
but
any
rate,
this
was
not
a
mortgagee
in
the
usual
context
of
what
one
would
think
of
as
being
a
mortgagee.
now,
the
new
britain
case
did
not
even
involve
the
mortgage
situation
but
it
did
not
even
have
a
mortgagee
as
a
party.
this
case
was
a
contest
between
local
tax
authorities
and
the
united
states.
and
therefore,
the
mortgagee
was
not
claiming
under
its
contract
as
we
are
claiming
and
as
we
are
in
court
claiming
our
contract
as
in
this
case.
as
to
the
buffalo
savings
bank
case,
in
this
case
we
do
not
feel
that
the
mortgagee
was
claiming
its
mortgage
--
under
its
mortgage
contract
either.
the
mortgage
in
that
case
provided
that
upon
default,
the
mortgaged
properties
could
be
sold
according
to
law.
now
the
statute
provided
that
upon
foreclosure
sale,
the
referee
could
either
pay
these
local
taxes
out
of
the
proceeds
or
that
they
could
be
either,
either
paid
out
of
the
proceeds
or
not,
that
the
property
could
be
sold
subject
to
the
local
taxes
if
the
referee
saw
fit
to
do
this.
so
this
was
not
a
case
of
where
there
was
a
contract
providing
specifically
as
we
have
in
this
case
where
we
are
entitled
to
recover
our
attorney's
fees
in
the
event
that
there
is
a
default.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
still
we
do
not
believe
that
in
the
buffalo
savings
bank
case
under
the
note
and
the
mortgage
that
the
matter
was
specifically
contracted
for
as
it
is
in
this
case.
this
court
--
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
yes
it
does,
but
--
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
--
but
this
was
not
provided
--
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
if
that
question
was
before
the
court
no
doubt
we
would,
yes.
this
court
actually
treated
the
local
taxes
in
the
buffalo
savings
bank
case
as
a
contest
between
the
local
authorities
and
the
united
states.
the
opinion
reads
in
part
as
follows.
the
states
may
not
avoid
the
priority
rules
of
the
federal
tax
lien
by
the
formalistic
device
of
characterizing
subsequently
accruing
local
liens
as
expenses
of
sale
and
i
stress
the
fact
that
he
state
was
mentioned
in
this
opinion,
whereas
we
are
claiming
that
we
are
entitled
to
the
attorney's
fee
under
the
mortgage
contract.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
well,
we
contend
that
it
should
be
recognized
whether
--
and
we
contend
that
it
is
choate
but
that
it
should
be
recognized
whether
or
not
it
is.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
the
government
--
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
no,
the
government
referred
to
the
matter
of
being
fixed
and
determined
at
a
certain
time.
that
time
of
course
would
have
to
be
--
when
the
federal
tax
lien
was
placed
on
record.
now,
there
are
five
different
things
in
the
mortgage
that
we
contend
this
is
as
just
as
choate
as
any
of
them.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
no,
but
it
could
be
determined
what
the
maximum
amount
of
it
might
have
been,
just
to
--
it
computed
--
it
could
be
computed
--
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
the
principal
is
in
terms
of
maximum
too
so
far
as
the
date
that
the
federal
tax
lien
is
affixed
that
the
principal
may
be
paid
after
that
date,
enters
the
same
way,
it
maybe
(voice
overlap).
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
there
was
a
default
and
it
was
clear
that
there
would
be
an
attorney's
fee
the
amount
that
was
not
known,
that's
true,
but
except
in
the
same
sense
that
we
contend
that
all
of
these
other
elements
were
known,
it
was
subject
to
a
maximum
amount,
it
might
have
been
diminished.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
it
had
been
contracted
for.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
quite
right.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
well,
we
hadn't
earned
as
much
as
we
did
later
on
when
the
--
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
--
proceeding
was
finished.
that's
right.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
well,
we
feel
that
this
is
a
matter
of
contract.
we
feel
that
it
is
as
choate
as
the
other
items
but
we
feel
that
it's
a
matter
of
contract
and
that
whether
or
not
it's
choate
that
it
should
be
recognized
as
one
of
the
routes
of
a
mortgagee.
when
the
statute
was
passed,
it
didn't
say
that
choate
routes
of
the
mortgagee
would
be
recognized.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
i
would
say
they
would
not
claim
priority
in
that
case.
we
contend
that
the
choateness
test
should
not
be
applied
to
mortgagees
because
of
the
essential
difference
between
the
mortgagees
and
the
local
lienors
under
the
old
law
in
effect
1866
to
1913.
under
this
later
--
latter
category
of
liens
such
things
as
attaching
creditors,
material
lien
and
so
forth,
the
lienor
starts
adding
an
adverse
position
to
the
property
owner,
that
he
has
got
to
establish
the
fact
and
the
amount
of
his
lien,
he's
got
to
go
through
certain
legal
procedure.
in
some
cases
he
has
to
make
a
bond
and
all
of
the
procedures
that
are
common
to
the
provisional
remedies.
however,
in
a
case
such
as
ours,
the
mortgagee's
lien
is
already
established
of
record.
he
has
contracted
for
this
with
the
mortgagor
and
the
mortgage
contract
has
been
placed
to
record.
now,
the
statute
says
that
until
the
federal
tax
lien
is
filed,
it
is
not
valid
against
the
mortgagee.
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
statute
that
this
term
mortgagee
is
to
be
confined
only
to
principal
and
interest.
the
hr
report
has
a
represented
report
which
accompanied
the
1913
legislation
indicates
at
least
two
things
at
which
thereupon
the
intention
in
passing
the
statute,
this
is
shown
at
page
32
of
our
brief.
first,
that
the
government
should
occupy
the
same
position
regarding
liens
as
does
the
individual.
and
secondly,
that
this
legislation
was
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
business
transactions.
now,
if
the
government
should
occupy
the
same
position
as
an
individual,
certainly
the
government's
contention
should
be
denied
here.
there
were
individuals
involved
in
this
case.
one
individual
that
was
involved
for
example
was
arthur
andersen,
who
was
the
third
lienor
and
there's
no
suggestion
in
any
part
of
the
record
that
the
liens
of
any
of
the
individuals
would
come
against
the
claim
for
attorney's
fee.
also,
i
would
mention
our
statute,
number
51,
arkansas
statutes
51-1002
and
which
is
cited
at
page
41
of
our
brief
which
provides
that
every
mortgage
on
real
state
shall
be
a
lien
on
the
mortgage
property
and
it
does
deal
in
terms
of
the
mortgage,
not
in
the
terms
of
component
parts
of
the
mortgage,
principal,
interests,
court
costs,
attorney's
fees
or
any
of
the
other
things,
but
this
statute
speaks
in
terms
of
the
mortgage
itself.
now
also,
the
government
contention
is
contrary
to
the
legislative
intention
expressed
in
the
house
of
representative
report
to
facilitate
business
transactions.
it
requires
a
mortgagee
to
take
a
loss
in
every
case
where
the
federal
tax
lien
is
filed
and
this
lien
maybe
filed
by
a
stranger
to
the
transaction.
if
we
could
round-off
the
figures
of
the
principal
and
interest
to
this
mortgage
to
say
$17,000
and
then
the
taking
terms
of
an
attorney
fee
of
exactly
$1250
and
then
a
federal
tax
lien
of
$6000.
we
see
why
this
is
true.
in
the
usual
case,
the
mortgagee
can
go
in
and
he
can
plan
on
making
a
bid
of
$17,000
or
rather
$18,250
which
would
cover
the
principal
interest
of
the
mortgage
and
also
would
cover
his
fee.
now
under
the
government
contention
here
this
$1250
would
have
to
be
paid
over
in
cash
because
the
government
claims
priority
of
the
lien
of
that
extent.
now
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
mortgagee
goes
in
and
submits
a
bid
of
$17,000,
then
some
outsider
might
come
in
and
submit
a
bid
of
$17,001
in
which
case
the
mortgagee
has
lost
in
that
event
too.
so,
the
mortgagee
has
just
consigned
or
committed
to
take
a
loss
here
in
every
case
where
the
federal
tax
lien
that
he
has
filed
even
though
that
lien
might
be
filed
by
a
stranger.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
conclude
the
first
proposition
to
which
i
address
myself
by
stating
that
the
interpretation
contended
for
by
the
government
in
this
case
would
prevent
a
lender
from
making
a
contract
which
in
all
reasonable
circumstances
would
be
enforceable
for
what
certainly
is
a
legal
and
valid
purpose
especially
in
arkansas
namely
to
recover
--
for
the
mortgagee
to
recover
his
expenses
including
attorney's
fees
in
the
event
that
foreclosure
is
necessary.
now,
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
point
two
which
is
that
the
attorney's
fee
is
just
as
choate
in
this
case
as
the
other
items
which
the
government
admits
to
be
choate.
and
we're
thinking
in
terms
of
a
fixed
and
definite
amount
to
use
the
words
of
government
counsel
at
the
time
that
the
federal
tax
lien
has
pay
--
placed
on
record.
now,
as
far
as
the
public
record
is
concerned
in
this
case,
this
mortgage
was
for
$20,000.
actually,
everything
that
we
are
claiming
and
including
the
attorney's
fees
come
to
less
than
$19,000.
but
even
if
we
get
off
of
the
public
record
and
if
we
consider
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
debt
at
the
time
that
the
federal
lien
is
placed
on
record,
it
should
be
paid
and
can
be
paid
after
that
time,
so
it
is
in
no
sense
fixed
and
established.
the
same
thing
is
true
as
to
interest
except
interest
might
vary
either
way.
it
may
accumulate
or
it
maybe
paid.
so
interest
also
is
not
fixed
or
definite
at
that
time.
in
the
literal
sense,
we
contend
that
none
of
these
items
is
choate
in
the
sense
of
being
fixed
and
definite.
we
have
court
cost
in
this
case.
court
costs
are
not
as
choate
as
attorney's
fees
are
because
there's
no
statutory
limitation
on
those.
there
was
involved
in
this
case
$257.55
court
cost
as
shown
at
page
51
of
the
record.
also
in
this
case,
there
was
a
commissioner's
fee
in
the
amount
of
$35.
this
fee
was
awarded
after
the
foreclosure
decree.
it
was
awarded
on
january
16
of
1962.
and
finally,
there
was
a
receiver's
fee
in
the
amount
of
$175
which
was
awarded
as
the
part
of
the
foreclosure
decree
on
november
15th
of
1961.
now,
under
arkansas
law,
these
attorney's
fees
are
choate.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
has
held
that
in
this
case
and
in
doing
so,
they
have
cited
arkansas
statute
68-102
which
is
a
part
of
the
negotiable
instrument's
law
to
the
effect
that
the
sum
payable,
and
a
notice,
a
sum
certain
even
though
it
might
include
a
provision
for
an
attorney's
fee.
concerning
the
case
which
was
decide
by
this
court
and
referred
to
by
mr.
roberts
of
security
mortgage
company
versus
powers,
the
government
has
taken
the
position
here
as
it
has
in
the
other
courts
that
because
the
federal
tax
lien
was
not
involved
in
that
case
that
it
should
not
be
considered
as
authority
here.
but
i
submit
that
that
was
a
case
in
which
it
was
necessary
for
the
court
to
make
an
inquiry
into
the
true
nature
of
an
attorney's
fee
provided
in
a
mortgage.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
yes
which
was
mentioned
by
mr.
roberts
in
his
presentation.
the
court
stated
that
in
that
case,
an
attorney's
fee
which
we
feel
is
substantial
--
similar
to
what
we
had
in
this
case
was
not
inchoate
but
perfect.
and
the
word
“perfect”
was
used
in
that
case
and
we
feel
that
it
is
equally
applicable
to
the
case
at
bar.
now,
as
has
been
brought
out
under
arkansas
law,
attorney's
fees
are
limited
to
10%
of
principal
and
accrued
interest
and
at
the
time
that
the
federal
tax
lien
attached,
all
of
the
world
knows
from
the
public
record
and
there
was
enough
on
the
public
record
for
the
government
to
know
the
same
as
everyone
else
that
attorney's
fees
were
provided
for
in
this
mortgage.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
well,
it
would
be
limited
to
the
amount
by
statute
and
i
would
presume
that
the
additional
amount
would
be
like
it
was
under
the
old
law
which
was
unenforceable.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
i
think
that
would
be
a
matter
of
contract
and
it
would
seem
that
it'd
be
limited
to
the
$500.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
well,
the
court
can.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
yes.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
well,
the
court
passes
on
these
fees
just
as
it
did
--
in
foreclosure
just
as
they
did
in
this
case.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
yes,
that's
true.
in
fact
there
have
been
cases
i
understand
particularly
in
the
lower
courts
where
it
has
been
cut
back
by
the
court.
the
court
reserves
the
right
in
each
case
to
determine
the
amount
of
fees
being
reasonable
as
well
as
within
the
statutory
limitation.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
that's
correct
your
honor.
point
number
three,
i
would
like
to
urge
that
the
result
contended
for
here
by
the
government
is
unjust
to
lenders
and
if
we
consider
certain
facts
in
this
case
side
by
side,
i
think
that
it
can
be
realized
that
this
is
true
and
these
facts
are
these.
when
this
property
was
sold
to
taxpayers
rogers,
there
was
no
problem
regarding
federal
taxes
and
there
was
no
reason
at
that
time
to
anticipate
any
problems
regarding
it.
now,
if
the
property
had
been
sold
to
someone
other
than
to
taxpayers
rogers
or
to
some
other
tax
delinquents,
this
problem
could
not
have
come
up
even
if
there
had
been
a
foreclosure
in
this
case.
also,
neither
pioneer
american
insurance
company
nor
the
development
company
incorporated,
the
two
mortgagees
in
this
case
have
any
responsibility
whatsoever
regarding
these
taxes.
furthermore,
there
is
no
negligence
suggested
on
the
part
of
pioneer
or
the
development
company
at
any
place
in
the
record.
yet
despite
these
things,
what
is
proposed
in
this
case
is
that
an
amount
equal
to
the
attorney's
fee
would
be
taken
away
from
the
mortgagees,
then
it
would
be
used
to
pay
taxes
owed
by
the
taxpayers
o
c
and
florine
rogers.
now,
whether
we
refer
to
this
as
choateness,
whether
referred
to
as
circular
priorities
or
whatever
we
might
say
about
it,
we
contend
that
the
substance
of
what
is
proposed
to
be
done
here
is
that
the
development
company
incorporated
would
be
required
to
pay
a
part
of
tax
--
of
the
taxes
that
are
owed
solely
by
our
taxpayers
rogers
and
not
by
these
taxpayers.
the
real
nature
of
the
interest
of
the
taxpayers
rogers
in
this
property
can
be
better
analyzed
if
we
imagine
or
if
we
assume
that
the
property
in
this
case
sold
for
even
more
than
it
is,
say
that
it's
sold
for
$30,000
or
$35,000
so
that
there's
enough
money
to
go
around
to
all
of
the
lienors
and
claimants
and
then
some
to
pay
to
the
rogers.
now
even
if
that's
true,
and
even
if
the
government
lien
is
paid
off
here,
and
we
get
down
to
taxpayers
rogers
still
and
this
does
not
seemed
to
be
challenged
by
anyone,
the
government
or
anyone
who
is
in
this
case
still
the
attorney's
fee
is
going
to
be
taken
out
before
the
surplus
is
paid
to
taxpayers
rogers.
consequently,
their
interest
in
this
property
is
subject
to
the
attorney's
fee.
and
therefore,
they
have
no
rights
in
the
property
until
that
attorney's
fee
has
been
paid.
now,
not
only
concerning
taxpayer's
rogers
here,
but
the
government
proposal
here
that
we
contend
would
cast
a
cloud
over
most
of
the
mortgages
of
the
country.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
yes
your
honor.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
any
situation
we
can
imagine
here
whether
the
government
lien
played
a
part
here
or
what
it
did
not
play
a
part
here
if
there
were
sufficient
funds
to
go
around,
still
the
taxpayer
does
not
get
the
funds
that
are
used
to
pay
the
attorney's
fee.
he
comes
in
after
that.
and
under
the
aqualino
case,
they
spoke
not
only
of
the
nature
of
the
taxpayer's
interest
but
the
extent
of
his
interest.
and
we
contend
that
in
this
case,
the
extent
of
this
taxpayer's
interest
is
what
is
left
after
the
attorney's
fee
has
been
paid.
now
--
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
in
subject
to
the
mortgage
lien,
a
component
part
of
which
is
the
attorney's
fee
and
the
rogers,
the
rogers
would
not
realize
any
money
from
the
surplus
if
they
were
a
surplus
until
after
the
attorney's
fee
had
been
paid.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
the
rogers
are
the
owners
of
the
property.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
the
rogers
haven't
paid
it
and
they're
not
going
to
pay
unless
it's
paid
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
property.
but
my
point
is
that
whether
the
government
lien
is
in
this
case
or
whether
it's
not
in
the
case.
if
we
assume
a
situation
where
the
property
sales
enough
that
it
will
pay
all
of
the
prior
lienors
including
the
government
lien
so
that
there
is
a
surplus
for
the
rogers.
the
surplus
available
to
the
rogers
will
be
diminished
to
the
extent
of
the
attorney's
fee.
they
will
not
real
--
they
will
not
realize
the
amount
that
goes
to
pay
the
attorney's
fee
and
consequently,
our
opposition
is
that
they
do
not
have
rights
in
the
property
to
the
extent
of
the
funds
that
will
be
required
to
pay
the
attorney's
fee.
under
the
state
law,
they
will
not
real
--
they
wouldn't
realize
it
even
if
there
were
enough
to
get
to
them
(voice
overlap).
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
they
have
some
interest
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
well
--
yes,
if
there's
a
$5000
left
before
the
attorney's
fee
is
taken
out.
after
the
government
--
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
well
i'm
talking
about
--
i'm
talking
your
honor
about
after
the
foreclosure
sales.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
well,
the
court
decree
has
awarded
the
attorney's
fee
before
the
--
before
the
foreclosure
of
sale.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
yes,
and
which
it
has
done
it
this
case.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
no,
i
did
not
say
that.
i
didn't
intend
to
say
that
your
honor.
at
that
time,
the
exact
amount
of
the
fee
has
yet
to
be
determined.
it
will
be
determined
in
the
foreclosure
decree.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
he
has
an
interest
in
the
property
subject
to
the
attorney's
fee
if
it
goes
into
foreclosure.
he
cannot
realize
the
property
without
paying
the
debt
or
without
going
through
the
foreclosure
procedure.
and
if
it
goes
through
the
foreclosure
procedure,
the
attorney's
fees
will
be
paid
under
our
state
procedure
if
there's
enough
money
to
pay
them
from
the
sale
of
the
property.
now,
concerning
not
to
rogers
but
other
mortgagees,
and
we
pointed
out
on
page
35
of
our
brief
that
on
june
30,
1961,
the
amount
of
unpaid
taxpayer
accounts
with
the
internal
revenue
service
amounted
to
approximately
a
billion
dollars.
now,
we
cannot
believe
that
this
technique
of
collection
will
mean
too
much
in
collecting
these
unpaid
taxes.
some
of
this
undoubtedly
will
be
collected
by
the
sending
out
of
notices,
some
of
them
will
be
collected
by
collection
fee
of
work,
and
some
of
them,
the
mere
filing
of
the
lien
that
when
it's
filed
will
cause
the
collection
of
those
accounts.
and
in
some
cases
of
course
you
will
have
involve
taxpayers
whose
property
is
foreclosed.
but
in
the
foreclosure
cases
even,
there'll
be
no
collection
unless
there's
a
surplus
over
the
principal
and
over
--
and
the
interest
of
all
prior
mortgages
and
incidentally
in
this
case,
this
is
not
at
all
the
case
where
the
government
is
coming
out
empty-handed.
they
will
get
about
to
$3750
in
any
case
and
under
the
contention
that
they're
making,
they'll
get
approximately
$5000.
and
its
--
but
it's
only
in
cases
where
there
is
a
surplus
over
the
payment
of
all
of
the
prior
mortgagees
that
this
will
be
of
any
assistance
in
collecting
delinquent
taxpayer
accounts.
on
the
other
hand,
on
this
same
date
of
june
30th,
1961,
and
this
is
pointed
also
at
page
35
of
our
brief.
there
is
over
$215
billion
of
the
mortgage
debt
in
the
country.
now,
39
states
in
the
united
states
allow
attorney's
fees
in
some
form,
6
did
not
rule
on
the
question
and
only
6
of
them
deny
recovery.
this
is
pointed
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
so
that
the
rule
contended
for
by
the
government
would
mean
that
in
the
great
majority
of
mortgages
all
over
the
united
states,
lenders
will
be
placed
in
the
position
where
they
will
be
required
to
take
a
loss
if
the
tax
lien
is
filed
against
the
property
owner's
property
where
there's
a
mortgage.
mr.
owen
c.
pearce
and
district
of
columbia,
thank
you,
your
honor.
51
jurisdictions,
i
should
have
said.
it
does
include
the
district
of
columbia.
another
thing,
the
inequities
which
will
be
worked
here,
the
work
so
--
work
harder
against
the
taxpayer
than
they
do
against
the
government
for
the
reason
that
the
attorney's
fee
in
these
cases
is
going
to
be
an
amount
which
will
be
in
some
reason
were
relation
to
the
principle
mortgage
debt.
in
our
case
in
arkansas,
it's
limited
to
10%
of
the
principal
and
interest.
in
some
cases,
it's
limited
to
a
reasonable
fee
to
be
set
by
the
court.
but
in
any
rate
of
this
some
relationship
there
that
will
have
--
that
will
be
reasonable
in
some
degree
with
the
amount
of
the
mortgage
debt.
on
the
other
hand,
the
tax
lien
maybe
any
amount.
in
this
case,
where
the
attorney's
fee
was
$1250,
the
tax
lien
amounted
to
$6000.
it
could
of
course
have
been
$50,000
or
$100,000
which
we
contend
makes
this
greatly
inequitable
so
far
as
the
taxpayer
is
concerned.
in
closing,
i
submit
that
the
fair
rule
in
these
cases
should
be
the
rule
of
the
best,
the
aquilino
and
the
durham
cases
where
it
was
said
that
the
threshold
question
was
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
taxpayer
has
property
or
as
to
property
under
state
law.
thank
you.
