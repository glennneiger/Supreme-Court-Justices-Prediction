members
of
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
priority
of
a
federal
tax
lien
versus
a
lien
for
attorney's
fees.
it
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
arkansas.
the
facts
may
be
briefly
summarized.
they're
really
not
in
dispute.
the
taxpayers
against
whom
the
tax
assessments,
the
federal
tax
assessments
were
made
had
purchased
in
1958,
a
parcel
of
real
estate
located
in
sebastian
county,
arkansas.
in
the
note,
which
they
assumed
when
they
bought
the
property,
the
maker
had
agreed
in
the
event
of
default
the
price
of
the
placing
of
the
--
and
of
the
placing
of
the
note
in
the
hands
of
attorney
for
collection,
or
if
the
note
is
collected
through
any
court
proceedings,
the
maker
had
agreed
to
pay
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
the
mortgage
which
secured
the
note
provided
that
if
the
grantor
should
fail
to
pay
any
interest
or
installment
or
principal
when
due
then
at
the
option
of
the
holder,
all
of
the
indebtedness
secured
by
the
mortgage
would
become
due
and
the
mortgage
could
be
foreclosed.
the
taxpayers
here
did
default
on
the
payments
under
the
note
in
october
of
1960
and
all
payments
subsequent
thereto.
on
march
24,
1961,
the
respondent
filed
a
suit
to
foreclose
its
mortgage
and
sought
in
that
suit
the
allowance
of
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
the
united
states
was
named
a
party
defendant
pursuant
to
section
2410
of
title
28,
because
of
then
two
existing
tax
liens
that
had
been
filed
of
record,
one,
november
29,
1960,
the
month
following
to
the
default
and
one
on
january
30,
1961.
in
its
answer,
the
united
states
admitted
that
its
liens
were
junior
to
the
mortgage
and
subordinate
thereto
to
the
extent
of
principal
and
interest.
it
did
however
assert
that
its
liens
were
superior
to
the
lien
of
the
mortgagor
or
the
mortgagee
rather
for
an
attorney's
fees.
on
november
9,
1961,
the
united
states
amended
its
answer,
and
in
its
amended
answer,
included
three
additional
federal
tax
liens
that
had
been
filed
on
april
14,
july
17,
and
october
3,
1961.
on
november
15,
1961,
the
chancery
court
of
sebastian
county,
arkansas
entered
its
decree
foreclosing
the
mortgage
and
fixed
an
attorney's
fee
of
$1250.
it
held
that
that
attorney's
fee
was
entitled
to
priority
over
the
federal
tax
lien.
on
appeal
by
the
united
states,
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
with
the
dissent
by
the
chief
justice
affirmed
the
lower
court's
decree.
this
court
has
many
times
held
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
on
november
15,
1961,
that
was
after
the
last
notice
of
the
federal
tax
lien
had
been
filed
your
honor.
this
court
has
many
times
held
that
the
federal
tax
lien
is
a
court
lien
as
of
the
date
that
it
arises.
the
tax
liens
arise
under
section
6321
and
6322
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
1954.
these
assessments
that
caused
the
liens
to
come
into
being
are
made
before
the
filing
of
the
notice,
so
that
the
liens
had
actually
been
and
being
ahead
of
a
filing
of
a
notice
here.
however,
section
6323
(a)
of
the
revenue
code
of
1954
requires
that
prior
to
their
being
entitled
to
priority
over
a
mortgagee,
pledgee,
judgment
creditor
or
purchaser,
the
notice
of
the
lien
must
be
filed.
recently,
this
court
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
buffalo
savings
bank
which
was
decided
on
january
7th,
1963
held
that
the
federal
tax
lien
was
entitled
to
priority
over
a
lighter
accruing
state
tax
or
local
tax
even
though
under
state
law,
the
local
tax
was
entitled
to
priority
over
the
mortgagee's
mortgage.
now,
in
that
case
as
here,
the
buffalo
savings
bank
in
--
argued
and
contended
that
because
the
state
taxes
were
required
it
could
be
paid
and
added
to
the
mortgage
that
they
also
should
be
entitled
to
the
same
standing
as
the
mortgagee
to
be
ahead
of
the
federal
taxes.
they
also
contended,
as
the
state
court
had
held
there
that
the
property
should
be
sold
and
the
taxes
paid
as
a
cost
of
the
proceeding
that
they
were
entitled
to
have
the
property
sold
and
the
taxes
paid
as
part
of
the
cost.
this
court
held
that
that
could
not
be
done.
it
cited
the
new
britain
case
and
said
that
the
new
britain
case
was
controlling.
now,
it
is
settled
law,
we
submit,
that
the
federal
tax
lien
when
it
comes
into
competition
with
other
liens
is
a
choate
lien.
this
court
has
held
that
a
lien
to
be
entitled
to
award
--
to
an
award
of
priority
over
and
ahead
of
the
federal
tax
lien
must
be
choate.
now,
in
its
test
of
choateness,
it
has
developed
three
standards
that
that
competing
lien
must
obtain.
one
is
that
the
identity
of
the
property
against
which
the
liens
tended
must
be
known,
the
identity
of
the
lienor
must
be
known,
and
the
amount
of
the
lien
must
be
fixed
and
definite.
it
is
in
the
last
category
that
the
government
submits
that
this
lien
for
attorney's
fees
was
not
perfect.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
known
until
after
the
liens
were
filed
sometime
in
november
when
--
at
1961,
when
the
foreclosure
decree
was
entered,
and
the
court
awarded
the
attorney's
fees
for
$1250.
it
was
not
until
that
date
that
the
competing
attorney's
lien
met
the
test
set
out
by
this
court
to
meet
the
requirement
of
choateness.
now,
respondent
says
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes
your
honor.
in
other
words,
we
contend
that
it
is
not
until
the
fee
is
fixed
that
it
becomes
known.
now,
it
is
known
that
in
the
foreclosure,
if
there
is
to
be
a
foreclosure
procedure.
now
actually,
in
a
default
situation
there
is
not
always
a
foreclosure.
it
is
only
a
right
that
comes
into
being.
it
might
not
be
foreclosed.
it
could
even
under
the
instrument
before
this
court
which
is
really
a
deed
of
trust
rather
than
a
mortgage,
it
contained
the
power
of
sale
which
could
have
been
exercised
without
a
foreclosure
proceeding.
now,
in
that
connection,
this
court
has
held
many
times
and
even
though
the
lien
may
be
known,
that
that
is
not
itself
sufficient
in
the
white
bear
brewing
company
case
for
instance.
there,
the
competing
mechanic's
lien
had
already
gotten
a
judgment
ahead
of
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
the
tax
lien.
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
for
execution.
then
the
tax
liens
came
into
being
and
this
court
reversed
per
curiam
a
seventh
circuit
holding
that
that
competing
lien
was
entitled
to
priority.
it
was
not
choate
at
that
time
even
though
the
lien
itself
had
come
into
being.
now,
we
admit
that
the
lien
for
attorney's
fees
had
--
or
liens
for
attorney's
fees
had
come
into
being
at
the
time
that
the
mortgage
was
created.
it
was
just
that
it
was
not
choate
within
the
--
as
that
term
has
been
defined
by
this
court.
now,
it
is
the
contention
of
the
respondent
as
i
understand
it
that
the
choateness
test
has
not
been
applied
to
the
four
categories
set
out
in
section
6323
(a);
that
is
the
category
of
the
mortgagee,
pledgee,
judgment
creditor,
or
purchaser.
it
is
our
position
that
it
has
been
in
the
ball
construction
company
case,
the
parties
agreed
that
there
was
a
mortgage
involved
in
that
situation.
the
dissent
points
out
that
the
parties
agreed
and
stipulated
more
or
less
that
there
was
a
mortgage
under
state
law.
this
court
has
held
that
it
is
the
state
law
that
will
determine
what
type
of
lien
or
whether
there
is
a
lien.
the
priority
of
the
lien
however
is
for
the
federal
law.
now,
ball
construction
company,
while
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
had
some
difficulty
in
determining
just
what
this
court
did
hold
in
its
per
curiam
opinion,
but
it
was
briefed,
it
was
argued
on
the
contention
that
there
was
a
mortgage
involved
and
that
the
dissent
pointed
out
that
the
parties
did
concede
that
a
mortgage
was
involved.
but
there,
these
amounts
advanced
that
this
lien
covered
had
not
come
into
being
until
after
the
federal
tax
liens
had
been
filed.
now
the
same
is
true
in
white
bear
brewing
company.
there
you
had
a
judgment
creditor
competing
with
the
federal
tax
lien.
he
already
had
his
judgment.
it
was
even
in
the
hands
of
the
sheriff
for
execution
at
the
time
the
federal
tax
liens
came
into
being.
so
again,
this
court
has
applied
the
choateness
test
where
the
four
categories
may
be
involved
or
one
of
the
four
hasn't
done
so
in
all
four.
now,
there
has
been
--
there
have
been
two
recent
appellate
court
decisions
upholding
the
choateness
test
where
a
lien
is
competing
with
the
federal
government.
one
is
a
local
district
of
columbia
circuit
court
case
involving
a
pledgee,
the
stevan,
s-t-e-v-a-n
trustee,
versus
union
trust
company.
it
was
decided
march
28,
1963
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
number
16865
in
which
that
court
while
finding
the
pledgee
to
be
entitled
to
priority,
did
apply
the
choateness
test
as
it
applies
to
a
pledgee.
the
government's
concession
in
the
crest
finance
company
case
was
based
on
the
government's
belief
that
there,
the
advances
having
been
made
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
tax
lien,
the
crest
finance
had
a
choate
lien.
the
other
appellate
court
has
an
interim
that
has
ruled
this
and
as
it
applies
to
attorney's
fees
is
a
--
intermediate
court
of
appeals
in
illinois.
i
have
it
in
my
notes
here
but
i
can't
find
the
citation,
it's
a
recent
case
involving
attorney's
fees.
it
is
the
apollo,
a-p-o-l-l-o
savings
and
loan
association
versus
purow,
p-u-r-o-w,
to
intermediate
court
of
appeals,
the
appellate
court
of
illinois,
second
district,
second
division,
number
11629
decided
february
the
19th
in
which
the
court
held
that
the
attorney's
fees
were
not
incurred
or
the
amount
thereof
definitely
fixed
until
after
the
filing
of
the
notice
of
the
federal
tax
lien.
in
such
case,
the
federal
lien
is
superior
to
the
lien
for
attorney's
fees.
now,
respondent
cites
this
court's
case
in
powers,
powers
case
as
contending
that
the
lien
for
the
attorney's
fees
was
choate
at
the
time
the
mortgage
was
entered
into
as
opposed
to
our
contention
that
it
is
not
choate
until
the
fees
are
definitely
fixed.
the
powers
case
did
not
involve
a
federal
tax
lien.
it
involved
the
basic
question
of
whether
the
attorney
was
in
the
position
of
a
lien
holder.
that
case
arose
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
and
under
the
bankruptcy
act
at
that
time,
a
contingent
claim
was
not
provable
in
bankruptcy.
and
you
had
a
situation
where
the
attorney
was
claiming
he
had
a
lien
and
that
he
should
be
entitled
to
perfect
the
lien
after
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy.
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
there
are
certain
liens
that
maybe
perfected
after
the
adjudication
as
long
as
they
were
in
being
before
the
adjudication
of
bankruptcy.
and
there,
the
use
of
the
term
that
the
lien
was
not
inchoate
was
the
way
this
court
put
it
was
in
describing
really
whether
they
had
a
lien
or
not.
this
court
went
on
and
in
language
--
and
in
language
said
that
it
was
contingent
upon
his
perfecting
it
and
obtaining
the
amount
so
that
we
feel
that
the
court
while
it
used
the
term
that
the
lien
was
not
inchoate.
it
was
only
in
the
sense
of
whether
he
had
a
lien
or
did
not
have
a
lien.
we
admit
here
that
the
attorney
had
a
lien.
now,
there
is
some
discussion
in
some
lower
court
cases
allowing
the
attorney's
fees
of
equating
the
attorney's
fees
with
interest.
we
conceded
here
and
do
concede
that
the
balance
due
on
the
mortgage,
the
principal
amount
still
owing
plus
interest
is
due
and
entitled
to
priority
over
the
federal
tax
lien.
now,
some
of
the
lower
courts
in
awarding
priority
to
the
federal
tax
lien
or
rather
in
awarding
priority
to
the
attorney's
fees
over
a
federal
tax
lien
have
said
that
it
is
the
same
as
interest.
now,
we
submit
that
that
is
not
true
that
interest
is
definite
in
amount
and
that
it
is
only
a
mathematical
computation
that
gets
to
the
exact
amount
of
interest
that
maybe
owed
to
the
mortgagee.
once
the
mortgage
is
in
default
and
the
principal
is
known,
the
property
is
known,
the
lienor
is
known
and
it
only
takes
a
mathematical
computation
to
ascertain
the
amount
of
the
interest
that
is
due.
and
we
submit
that
therefore
the
interest
does
meet
the
choateness
test
and
we
do
not
contest
or
contend
that
we
would
come
ahead
of
interest.
it's
also
a
contention
that
we
have
allowed
local
cost
to
be
paid
ahead
of
a
federal
tax
lien.
the
federal
government
has
always
conceded
at
least
in
tax
cases
where
it
goes
into
a
state
court
and
goes
into
the
proceeding
that
it
is
bound
by
any
cost
that
are
allowable.
it
is
also
bound
as
it
was
here.
your
honors
will
note
the
records,
the
united
states
put
up
a
supersidious
bond
in
this
proceeding
which
of
course
it
would
not
be
required
to
do
in
federal
courts.
so
we
submit
that
in
recognizing
that
we
have
to
pay
cost,
that
we
do
so
under
the
theory
that
we
are
using
the
state
courts
for
our
litigation
and
that
we
are
subject
to
their
cost,
the
same
as
any
other
litigant
who
comes
in
to
their
courts
and
uses
them.
we
do
not
feel
that
that
makes
this
attorney's
fee
however,
come
ahead
of
us.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
no,
i
would
not
your
honor
for
this
reason.
cost
historically
in
this
country
has
not
been
a
part.
that
is
attorney's
fees
rather
historically
have
not
been
looked
upon
as
a
part
of
the
cost
of
litigation.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
a
state
may
do
it
as
it
did
in
buffalo
savings
bank,
your
honor,
and
this
court
8
to
1
said
that
it
could
not
in
a
per
curiam
opinion,
said
that
the
court
or
the
state
cannot
characterize
this
as
cost
and
therefore,
jump
ahead
of
the
federal
tax
lien.
i
believe
that
buffalo
savings
bank
decided
this
term,
answers
that
question
completely
and
new
britain
which
was
decided
prior.
now,
this
case
is
really
in
the
same
posture
as
new
britain
or
buffalo
savings
in
that
you
have
a
fund,
you
have
competing
lienors.
this
again
is
not
quite
the
case
that
new
britain
did
not
meet
which
was
what
the
mortgagee
had
paid
and
then
was
seeking
reimbursement.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
we
submit
that
it
would,
your
honor
buffalo
and
the
other
cases
of
this
court.
this
is
then
taking
something
that
is
not
historically
a
part
of
cost
and
adding
to
it
which
is
really
what
the
attempt
that
was
made
in
buffalo.
and
even
i
don't
believe
the
statute
in
buffalo
be
--
would
only
cover
those
where
the
instrument
itself
said
that
they
could
be
added
and
were
entitled
to
priority.
so,
i
remember
the
statute
in
buffalo
is
just
a
general
statute
that
attorney's
fees
in
foreclosure
suits
could
be
added
and
made
a
part
of
the
cost.
it
left
it
up.
the
statute
was
general
and
left
it
up
to
the
--
i
believe
it's
a
referee
in
new
york
who
actually
conducts
the
sale.
they
left
it
up
to
his
decision
and
judgment
how
we
would
handle
this
particular
attorney's
fee.
now,
in
the
federal
cases
that
this
court
has
handled
and
lower
courts,
the
--
what
is
distilled
from
them
is
that
the
federal
tax
lien
once
it
attaches
to
the
taxpayer's
property,
his
interest
cannot
be
decreased
by
any
later
occurring
event
that
in
order
for
his
interest
or
the
federal
tax
lien
to
be
defeated
by
a
lien,
that
lien
must
have
already
attached
to
the
property
and
to
the
taxpayer's
interest.
and
if
so
that
it
was
ahead
of
the
taxpayer,
so
that
at
the
time
the
tax
lien
went
on,
the
taxpayer
did
not
have
that
interest.
now,
respondent
has
cited
several
recent
cases
of
this
court
holding
that
the
taxpayer
affirming
lower
courts
decision
in
one
instance,
sending
one
back
to
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
for
further
holding,
finding
that
there
was
no
property
right
of
the
taxpayer
in
this
fund
to
which
the
federal
tax
lien
could
attach,
durham
lumber
and
aquilino.
now
in
most
instances,
the
state
procedures
had
been
followed
by
a
mechanic
in
durham
lumber
and
there
was
a
separate
state
statute
in
aquilino.
in
durham
lumber,
once
the
mechanics
filed
the
notice
of
lien,
the
mechanics
had
a
right
then
against
the
owner
or
contractor
as
opposed
to
his
right
against
the
subcontractor,
the
subcontractor
being
the
taxpayer.
so
that
the
court
found
there
was
no
right
of
the
subcontractor
any
longer
to
this
fund
and
therefore,
our
tax
lien
it
could
not
attach
to
it.
but
there,
you
did
not
have
as
here
an
award
here
of
attorney's
fees
against
who,
against
the
taxpayer.
so
that
also
this
attorney's
fees
coming
up
attaching
to
this
fund
through
the
taxpayer,
the
same
avenue
that
our
lien
is
attaching
to
this
fund
which
is
through
the
taxpayer.
now,
a
similar
argument
was
made
in
bank
of
america,
which
was
argued
before
this
court
several
years
ago,
but
where
when
there's
a
mortgage
involved,
that
all
the
tax
lien
could
attach
to
was
the
mortgage
or
its
interest
which
could
be
defeated
by
a
default
in
payments
on
the
mortgage.
and
this
court
said
the
fallacy
of
this
contention
is
evident.
in
best,
we
held
that
a
decedents
--
the
deceased
property
--
deceased
property
and
insurance
policies
on
his
own
life
was
limited
to
their
cash
surrender
value
and
did
not
extend
to
their
proceeds
which
he
could
never
enjoy.
here
however,
the
mortgagors
only
entire
fee
interest
in
the
properties
subject
only
to
the
mortgage
--
mortgages.
this
court
has
repeatedly
rejected
their
contention
that
because
a
fee
owned
by
a
taxpayer
was
already
encumbered
by
a
lien
which
enjoyed
seniority
under
state
law,
the
government's
lien
necessarily
sub
--
attached
subject
to
that
lien.
now
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
fact
that
the
taxpayers'
interest
here
could
be
defeated
by
later
events
such
as
the
award
of
the
attorney's
fees
or
his
default
under
the
mortgage.
and
under
the
cases
of
this
court
that
that
cannot
defeat
the
federal
tax
lien
which
has
already
attached
to
his
property.
now,
arkansas
does
have
the
title
theory
of
mortgages
which
under
their
holdings,
the
title
is
in
the
--
here
the
trustee,
but
the
title
is
gland
in
his
work
on
mortgages,
one
gland
on
mortgages,
section
28
at
page
191
has
said,
“the
truth
is
that
the
title
theory
must
always
be
adjusted
to
the
idea
that
the
mortgagee
has
a
security
interest
only.”
and
we
submit
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
you're
in
a
title
theory
or
lien
theory
state
where
you
have
a
mortgage
involved
that
really
all
it
is,
is
a
security
device.
and
that
the
taxpayer
has
the
basic
interest
that
our
lien
attached
to
that
interest
ahead
of
the
attorney's
fees
and
that
the
federal
lien
is
entitled
to
priority.
i'd
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
it
is
respondent's
position
that
the
mortgage
itself
provided
for
attorney's
fees.
as
i
read
the
provision,
he
cites
at
least
if
i
read
his
brief
correctly,
that
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
the
mortgage
does
or
doesn't,
the
note
definitely
did.
the
mortgage
has
a
provision
in
it
which
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
in
the
record,
i'm
trying
to
find
it
now,
your
honor.
page
13
of
the
record,
as
i
understand
their
position,
the
first
full
complete
paragraph
on
that
page;
it
is
our
position
that
if
that
is
all
that
they
--
it
is
pointed
out
in
the
mortgage
and
i
have
read
deed
of
trust,
and
i
find
no
other
provision
that
that
only
talks
of
the
party,
the
second
part,
the
party
of
the
first
part,
the
mortgagee
here
being
the
party
of
the
third
part.
and
if
that
is
what
they
contend
brings
in
to
the
mortgage,
the
right
to
pay
the
attorney's
fees
as
opposed
to
the
note,
that
its
ambiguous
and
that
there's
a
much
better
way
of
drafting
to
provide
that
the
mortgagee
may
pay
attorney's
fees
and
add
them
to
the
mortgage.
it
is
submitted
however,
that
that
would
really
make
no
difference,
your
honor,
by
the
government.
that
is
the
same
contention
that
was
made
in
buffalo
that
the
mortgage
there
allowed
the
mortgagee
to
pay
the
local
taxes
and
add
to
the
mortgage
and
that
therefore
they
would
be
entitled
the
priority
on
that
basis.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
there,
your
honor,
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
then
to
the
state
law
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
really
could
do
so.
arkansas
law
prior
to
1951,
a
provision
in
a
mortgage
providing
for
attorney's
fees
was
not
enforceable
under
the
arkansas
cases.
it
was
deemed
to
be
a
penalty.
now
in
1951,
the
arkansas
legislatures
changed
its
statute,
and
said
that
notes
calling
for
the
payment
of
attorney's
fees
would
be
alright
and
they
would
be
enforceable
as
contracts
for
--
of
indemnity.
now,
if
i
understand
the
contract
for
indemnity,
if
you
have
to
enforce
it,
you
bring
a
suit.
you
would
then
get
a
judgment
and
that
would
be
our
position
here
that
when
this
note
went
in
default.
the
attorney,
in
order
to
get
his
fee,
would
either
have
to
bring
a
separate
judge
--
a
suit
or
he
could,
of
course,
as
he
did
here
join
it
with
the
principal
suit
which
was
the
foreclosure
action.
but
if
it
provided
for
liquidated
damages
and
i
assume
you
mean
by
that,
if
the
mortgage
provided
that
in
the
event
of
default,
there
should
be
a
$250
attorney's
fees.
then
you
would
have
to
look
to
state
law
to
see
whether
that
is
valid
or
not.
because
really,
once
it's
in
default,
many
mortgages
never
reach
the
foreclosure
stage.
they
can
--
the
default
can
be
paid
up
the
default
payments.
and
the
fact
then,
if
i
understand
correctly,
your
contention
would
be
that
the
attorney's
fees
of
$250
would
be
payable
even
though
the
man
three
days
late
came
in
and
paid
up
his
mortgage
and
it
no
longer
went
in
to
default.
i
don't
think
that
many
states
would
allow
that.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
thank
you.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
closing,
i'd
like
to
comment
on
the
legislative
history
of
6323
(a)
which
is
a
recording
statute.
and
it's
clear
to
me
from
the
legislative
history
that
when
they're
talking
about
that
the
government
should
be
treated
as
other
parties,
it
means
in
being
required
to
record
its
lien.
this
court
has
held
many
times
that
in
priority
of
lien
situations
that
your
lien
has
to
be
choate
whereas
under
state
law,
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
have
a
choate
lien
in
order
to
defeat
other
lien
holders.
but
under
federal
law,
to
defeat
the
federal
tax
lien,
you
must
have
a
choate
lien.
now,
the
argument
that
the
property
right
interest,
it
is
the
property
right
at
the
time
the
federal
tax
lien
attaches
that
is
in
part
not
the
property
right
at
some
later
time
as
in
new
britain
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
the
interest
is
a
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
at
that
time,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
it's
subject
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
it's
subject
to
the
mortgage,
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
and
under
state
law,
the
mortgage
--
the
attorney's
fees
are
allowed
ahead
of
other
liens.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well,
subject
to
the
mortgage.
and
at
that
time,
there
is
no
attorney's
lien
other
than
as
called
might
be
come
into
being
through
the
necessity
of
using
the
attorney.
now
in
this
case,
the
federal
tax
lien
came
on
before
the
foreclosure
to
--
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
he
may
have.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
that
is
correct.
there
has
been
no
attorney
coming
to
being
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes,
that
is
correct.
there's
been
no
occasion
then
for
any
attorney's
fees
to
have
been
earned.
now,
the
same
would
have
been
true
in
new
britain.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
yes
your
honor,
we
think
that
your
case
in
new
britain
stands
exactly
further
--
in
new
britain
and
in
the
buffalo
savings
bank
case.
there,
state
taxes
are
always
ahead
of
the
mortgagor.
mr.
richard
m.
roberts
well
they
did
contend
that,
your
honor,
as
i
remember
in
buffalo
savings.
they
were
a
part
of
the
mortgage.
and
they
were
for
--
it
was
pointed
to
this
court
that
they
were
but
the
state
taxes
always
attach
ahead
of
the
taxpayer's
interest.
they
even
attach
ahead
of
the
mortgage.
under
state
law,
the
state
taxes
have
first
priority
and
that's
what
how
you
got
in
to
the
circular
priority
situation
in
new
britain
where
you
had
a
mortgage
ahead
of
the
federal
taxes,
the
state
ahead
of
the
mortgage.
the
state
taxes
almost
universally
attached
to
the
property
ahead
of
anyone's
interests.
so
we
say
that
that
is
not
important
here
and
that
it
is
the
taxpayer's
interest
at
the
time
our
tax
lien
went
on
and
it
was
not
subject
at
that
time
because
these
attorney's
fees
were
unknown
as
to
amount
and
it
was
not
subject
to
their
--
his
interest
which
affects
that
our
lien
attached
to
that
interest
at
that
time.
