but
that
is
--
is
that
your
law?
it's
a
law
that
rogers
had
no
interest
but
rather
the
rogers'
property
interest
is
subject
to
a
lien
in
favor
of
the
attorney's
fee
or
which?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course,
i
take
it
to
the
rogers
could
pay
the
attorney's
fee
without
requiring
his
payment
of
the
proceeds
to
the
foreclosure
sale,
couldn't
they
know
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
--
what
concerns
me,
its
conceptually
whether
that
means
that
the
rogers
have
no
interest
in
the
property
and
the
proceeds
until
after
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
do
but
you
say
that
if
there's
$5000
left
that
they
have
an
interest
only
in
$3750.
in
effect
that's
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
once
that
property
interest
concededly
is
the
question
of
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
is
the
law
of
--
does
the
law
ever
say
--
your
adversary
suggests
it
to
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
property
interest
--
at
the
time
is
in
the
property
owner.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
here,
the
taxpayers,
is
that
it,
subject
to
these
various
liens,
is
that
the
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
have
a
whole
piece
of
property.
now,
i
gather
a
mortgagee
has
an
interest
in
that
piece
of
property.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
--
there
maybe
taxes
due,
maybe
municipalities
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
have
some
kind
of
interest
in
it.
the
attorney
--
maybe
it's
not
right
but
he
may
also
have
an
interest
in
that
piece
of
property,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
owner
also
has
an
interest
in
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
at
the
time
--
what
you're
saying
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
federal
lien,
what's
--
what
that
attaches
to
is
the
owner's
interest
which
at
that
juncture
is
not
subject
to
any
attorney's
lien
because
that
hasn't
yet
been
fixed.
