mr.
norton
j.
come
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit,
which
denied
enforcement
of
the
board's
order
against
the
respondent,
erie
resistor,
a
manufacturer
of
electrical
components
and
plastics
in
pennsylvania.
the
board
found
that
erie
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act
by
awarding
in
the
course
of
an
economic
strike,
20
years
additional
seniority
to
replacements
for
strikers
and
also
to
strikers
who
return
to
work
during
the
strike.
so
that
in
a
subsequent
layoff,
strikers
who
did
not
return
to
work
until
after
the
strike
terminated
were
laid
off
as
junior
employees.
and
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
grant
of
a
seniority
advantage
to
employees
who
go
to
work
during
a
strike
was
the
concomitant
reduction
in
the
seniority's
standing
of
those
strikers
who
elect
to
remain
out
on
a
strike,
discriminates
an
employment
and
restrains
and
coerces
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
strike
in
violation
of
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now
the
underlying
facts
that
give
rise
to
this
problem
are
these:
on
march
31,
1959,
local
613
of
the
international
union
of
electrical
workers,
the
certified
representative
of
the
company's
production
and
maintenance
employees
called
a
strike
when
the
parties
were
unable
to
agree
upon
the
terms
of
a
new
contract.
the
strike
was
joined
by
all
of
the
approximately
478
employees
working
in
the
unit.
in
addition
at
that
time,
there
were
about
450
employees
in
the
unit
or
in
a
layoff
status.
throughout
april,
the
company
operated
on
a
reduced
basis
by
transferring
about
140
clerical
and
nonunit
employees
to
the
production
and
maintenance
unit.
on
may
3rd,
however,
the
company
notified
all
members
of
the
union
by
a
letter
that
it
intended
to
hire
replacements
and
its
strikers
would
retain
their
jobs
until
replaced.
in
accordance
with
that
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
under
mackay,
which
i'll
come
to
in
greater
detail,
the
company
had
a
right
to
do
that,
to
replace
the
strikers.
in
accordance
with
this
notice,
the
company
began
to
hire
replacements.
it
picked
up
one
new
hire
and
23
from
the
layoff
status.
it
assured
them
after
they
were
accepted
for
employment,
that
they
would
not
be
discharged
or
laid
off
upon
settlement
of
the
strike.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
it
depends
upon
what
we
mean
by
that
which
i
would
like
to
get
to
when
i
get
to
the
discussion
of
the
mackay
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
trial
examiner
found
that
the
employer
was
motivated
by
economic
considerations
in
making
this
offer.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
the
record
does
not
clearly
show
that
--
it
does
not
show
that
they
could
not
get
these
employees
without
making
this
offer
to
them
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
town
of
erie
at
this
time
happened
to
be
one
of
deprived
--
depressed
unemployment.
there
were
300
applications
that
the
company
had
from
new
employees
that
they
hadn't
acted
upon.
mr.
norton
j.
come
so
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
in
the
board's
view
of
this
case,
i've
merely
indicated
that
the
trial
examiner
had
found
that
the
company
was
economically
motivated.
in
the
board's
view,
this
type
of
a
super-seniority
arrangement
is
violative
of
the
statute
irrespective
of
the
employer's
good
motive
for
the
action.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
the
reason
i
say
i
believe
is
that
the
board
has
yet
--
has
never
had
a
case
where
it
has
been
offered
only
to
new
employees
and
as
i'd
like
to
develop
later,
i
think
it's
a
practical
matter
if
it
would
be
impossible
to
have
such
as
it
sounds.
because
if
you're
going
to
have
some
old
employees
that
are
going
to
go
to
work
as
you're
likely
to
have,
it
would
be
impossible
not
to
--
not
to
extend
the
benefit
to
them.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
has
been
the
case
in
every
one
of
the
cases
that
we've
had
so
far.
now,
on
a
bargaining
session
held
on
may
11th,
the
company
told
the
union
that
it
was
promising
replacements
job
security
and
that
in
order
to
implement
this
promise,
it
would
be
necessary
to
accord
them
some
form
of
super-seniority.
now,
you
had
about
five
bargaining
sessions
that
were
held
between
may
11th
and
may
28th.
the
company
proposed
several
alternative
forms
of
super-seniority
offering
to
negotiate
the
precise
nature
of
it,
but
insisting
in
each
case
that
it
had
to
have
super-seniority
in
some
form.
the
management
people
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
that
the
testimony
in
the
record
shows
that
they
did
use
that
word.
we
take
page
120
of
the
record,
which
is
the
testimony
of
gordon
farrell,
the
company's
industrial
relations
director,
and
128
of
the
record.
and
he
states
that
we
would
--
talking
about
on
may
11th,
that
we
would
have
to
accord
them
some
sort
of
super-seniority.
and
then
when
we
get
down
to
the
meeting
on
may
28th,
he
gets
more
specific
and
points
out
that
the
--
it
looked
as
though
the
super-seniority
would
have
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
20
years.
so
that
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
(inaudible)
--
from
the
record
that
the
company
officials
themselves
characterized
this
thing
as
super-seniority,
but
whatever
it
was
characterized
as,
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
arrangement
that
they
had
in
mind
was
an
arrangement
that
would
give
to
those
employees
who
went
to
work
during
the
strike
whether
they
were
new
hires,
employees
from
the
layoff
status,
or
strikers
who
left
the
picket
line,
they
had
to
be
given,
if
they
went
back
to
work
before
the
end
of
the
strike,
a
seniority
advantage
that
would
put
them
ahead
of
those
employees
who
remained
out
on
strike.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
only
for
layoff
and
recall
for
layoff.
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor,
and
i'd
like
to
return
to
that
a
bit
later
on
when
we
talk
about
mackay.
but
the
proposal
recited
on
its
face
and
the
testimony
bears
it
out,
that
this
20-year
seniority
was
to
apply
only
in
the
event
of
layoff
and
recall
for
layoff.
it
was
not
to
be
use
for
bumping
from
one
job
to
another
or
for
determining
vacations
or
other
benefits
that
turned
upon
seniority.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
now
on
may
28th,
the
company,
as
i've
indicated,
specified
that
the
kind
of
plan
that
they
had
in
mind
would
have
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
20
years
additional
seniority.
now
at
a
union
meeting
on
may
29,
the
strikers,
when
acquainted
with
this
proposal,
unanimously
resolved
to
continue
striking
until
the
company
abandoned
its
insistence
on
super-seniority,
which
it
never
did.
as
although
there
were
subsequent
bargaining
meetings
at
which
the
seniority
question
was
discussed,
the
company
still
insisted
upon
some
form
of
super-seniority.
mr.
norton
j.
come
may
it
please
the
court.
i
indicated
at
the
conclusion
of
the
argument
yesterday
that
a
bargaining
meeting
of
may
28th,
the
company
had
indicated
to
the
union
that
the
superseniority
that
they
thought
they
needed
would
have
to
be
in
the
neighborhood
of
20
years.
well,
in
ensuing
weeks,
this
superseniority
plan,
this
20-year
plan,
was
announced
to
the
employees.
there
was,
first
a
letter
by
the
company
on
june
10
to
all
the
employees
and
members
of
the
union
indicating
that
20
years
additional
seniority
would
be
given
to
employees
who
went
to
work
during
the
strike.
after
that
announcement,
the
number
of
returning
strikers
drastically
shot
up.
up
to
that
point,
there
had
only
been
about
eight
strikers
who
had
returned.
with
the
june
10
announcement,
the
number
shot
up
to
87,
and
the
next
week
there
was
a
further
announcement
and
the
number
shot
up
to
125.
at
that
point,
which
is
about
june
25th,
the
union
capitulated
and
decided
that
it
would
have
to
call
on
to
strike.
a
contract
was
entered
into
reserving
the
superseniority
question
for
a
further
litigation
before
the
board
and
the
courts.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
superseniority
was
offered
to
outsiders
as
well.
it
was
offered
to
new
hires,
to
employees
who
returned
to
work,
who
were
in
the
layoff
category
as
well
as
to
employees
who
were
on
strike.
so
it
was
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
a
125
came
back
who
were
striking.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
were
478
on
strike
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
before
the
announcement
of
the
seniority,
you
had
about
eight
strikers
who
had
returned.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
about
that,
yes,
sir.
that
would
be
125.
the
company
then
began
to
recall
the
strikers
who
had
not
been
replaced
in
order
of
seniority
and
built
up
its
workforce
gradually
back
to
about
450
levels.
this
was
around
june
and
july.
however,
in
september
and
may
into
the
next
year,
it
was
necessary
to
layoff,
and
as
a
result,
a
substantial
number
of
strikers
were
laid
off
who
were
reduced
to
junior
status
solely
as
a
result
of
this
20-year
superseniority
program.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
certainly
he
cannot
unilaterally
alter
the
existing
condition
without
bargaining
with
the
union.
it
was
at
all
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
of
course
as
you
appreciate,
your
honor,
that
is
a
problem
that
is
being
litigated
in
the
--
in
the
courts
right
now.
that
was
in
the
glidden
case,
it's
been
in
the
ross
gear
case
and
we're
at
the
threshold
of
answering
that
question.
in
this
case,
however,
since
they
did
enter
into
a
new
contract
which
continued
the
seniority
provisions
of
the
--
of
the
old
contract,
i
think
you
had
the
two
superimposed,
one
upon
the
other
so
quickly
that
--
that
we
don't
have
that
gap
here.
the
only
new
thing
that
was
added
was
this
superseniority
program
which
favored
those
who
had
returned
to
work
during
the
strike
for
purposes
of
future
layoffs.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
now
a
complaint
was
issued
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
board
found
that
although
the
company
was
willing
to
bargain
about
the
number
of
years
or
the
form
of
the
superseniority,
at
all
times
it
was
insisting
that
it
had
to
have
some
kind
of
an
arrangement
which
would
give
a
preferential
seniority
advantage
to
those
employees
who
returned
to
work
during
the
strike.
so
that
i
think
that,
although
the
number
of
years
might
have
been
left
open,
there
was
no
question
that
at
all
times
the
company
was
taking
the
position
that
it
had
to
prefer
those
who
went
to
work
during
the
strike
ahead
of
the
strikers.
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
was
no
question,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
the
board's
position
is
that,
whether
there
was
a
contract
in
effect
or
not,
this
kind
of
a
seniority
clause
is
illegal
and
that
the
company
could
not
insist
upon
it.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i'm
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
i
want
to
--
i
want
to
get
to
that
right
now.
it
was
illegal
because
the
board
found
that
such
a
clause
is
inherently
discriminatory
and
restrains
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
strike
in
violation
of
sections
8
(a)
(1)
and
section
8
(a)
(3),
and
i'd
like
to
turn
to
that
right
now.
section
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
there
was
an
8
(a)
(5)
charge
here
but
the
8
(a)
(5)
charge
flows
from
the
finding
that
the
clause
is
violative
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
and
(3)
because
it
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
case
that
you
had,
your
honor,
was
the
katz
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
in
which
it
was
held
that
it
was
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(5)
to
grant
a
unilateral
wage
increase
in
the
course
of
negotiations.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
has
only
a
tangential
relevance
in
that
it
shows
that
if
you
--
there
are
certain
kinds
of
conte
--
conduct
which
might
be
so
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
act
that
it
could
be
a
violation
in
a
per
se
sense,
let
us
say
without
necessarily
finding
that
the
company
had
a
bad
motive
here.
mr.
norton
j.
come
it's
an
8
(a)
(1)
and
an
8
(a)
(3)
case.
mr.
norton
j.
come
the
board
found
that
it
violated
both
sections
and
if
the
board
is
sustained
on
that,
then
there's
no
question
that
the
8
(5)
would
follow
because
it's
an
8
(5)
to
insist
upon
in
the
illegal
clause.
now,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
the
8
(a)
(1)
aspect
of
the
--
of
the
case
for
us.
now,
section
8
(a)
(1),
as
the
court
is
well
aware,
makes
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
section
7
rights.
now,
a
normal
strike
for
economic
objective
is
of
course,
a
concerted
activity
protected
by
section
7.
now,
a
seniority
program
that
prefers
nonstrikers
to
strikers,
which
is
what
this
program
did,
manifestly
restrains
and
coerces
employees
in
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
strike
irrespective
of
what
the
company's
ultimate
motive
may
have
been.
now,
the
worker
who
accepts
employment
during
the
strike
and
the
employee
who
returns
to
work
are
rewarded.
they
get
their
seniority
standing
boosted.
well,
the
employee
who
stays
on
strike
is
penalized
solely
because
he
has
elected
to
continue
to
exercise
his
right
to
strike
and
the
reward
and
the
penalty
are
inextricable.
they're
like
a
double-edged
sword
because
seniority
is,
by
its
very
nature,
a
relative
thing,
and
if
you're
going
to
boost
up
one
person's
seniority,
you're
necessarily
going
to
reduce
the
relative
seniority
advantage.
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
might
be
a
different
case,
although
i
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
superseniority
has
a
much
more
pervasive
effect
and
as
i'm
going
to
try
to
show
you,
this
is
a
question
of
balancing
competing
interests
here
and
the
superseniority
clearly
tips
the
scales.
my
own
view
is
that
at
the
offering
of
the
additional
wage
incentive
would
also
tip
the
scales
and
i
think
that
you
have
cases
that
would
support
them,
although,
an
argument
could
be
made
in
the
other
direction.
not
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
that
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
to
get
down
to
and
i'm
going
to
try
to
show
the
court
that
the
effects
of
--
of
this
superseniority
policy
are
much
more
drastic
and
pervasive
than
the
kind
of
replacement
that
was
permitted
in
mackay.
but
the
thing
that
i
wanted
to
point
out
before
i
get
to
mackay
is
that
the
key
to
these
cases
is
not
merely,
whether
or
not,
the
employer
has
an
ultimate
business
motive
for
what
he
has
been
doing
here.
now,
it's
true
that
not
every
interference
with
section
7
activity
amounts
to
a
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act
or
8
(a)
(3)
of
the
act.
it's
been
recognized
by
the
board
and
the
courts
including
this
court
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
has
to
be
read
in
such
a
way
as
to
accommodate
other
competing
legitimate
interests.
and
for
that
reason,
for
example
normal
business
decisions
such
as
granting
a
wage
increase
or
reducing
wages
even
though
it
may
have
an
incidental
consequence
of
affecting
union
or
concerted
activity
may
be
privileged
if
motive
is
a
legitimate
one
and
you
lose
that
privilege
if
the
motive
is
not
legitimate.
by
the
same
token,
however,
there
are
--
is
a
class
of
activity
and
that's
usually
the
situation
where
union
or
concerted
activity
is
singled
out
as
the
basis
for
discrimination
where
the
effect
on
the
exercise
of
the
section
7
right
is
so
drastic
that
it
cannot
be
--
it
is
not
privileged
even
though
the
employers'
ultimate
objective
may
be
a
business
one.
now,
in
mackay,
the
court
held,
and
that
was
in
1938,
that
in
economic
strike,
the
employer
in
the
interest
of
continuing
his
business
could
hire
replacements
for
the
strikers
and
give
them
permanence.
that
was
an
accommodation
that
was
made
in
the
interest
of
enabling
the
employer
to
run
his
business.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well
i
think,
your
honor,
that
when
you
look
at
the
way
it
works,
it
is
not
held.
i
appreciate
you
--
you
can
view
it
as
something
lesser
because
after
all
you
are
taking
the
employee
back
and
he
doesn't
--
he
doesn't
lose
a
job,
but
let
me
try
to
show
you
what
does
happen
and
in
the
board's
view,
this
is
--
this
is
far
worse.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
let
me
make
clear
first
of
all
that
the
company
here
did
not
need
this
superseniority
plan
in
order
to
guarantee
the
permanence
which
mackay
is
talking
about.
mackay
says
that
if
you
replace
a
striker
with
a
replacement
permanently,
that
striker
is
not
entitled
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
and
was
there
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
it
was
not
essential
for
him
to
retain
that
job
vis-à-vis
the
striker
that
he
replaced
because
this
superseniority
policy,
as
i
pointed
out
yesterday,
apply
only
in
cases
of
future
layoffs.
it
could
not
be
used
for
bumping
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
makes
it
quite
clear
that
if
you
put
into
a
job,
let
us
say
a
replacement
and
the
striker
who
had
that
job
at
30
years
seniority
came
back,
he
couldn't
claim
that
job
even
without
this
20-year
superseniority.
the
only
thing
that
the
20-year
program
did
was
to
guarantee
that
the
replacement,
not
only
would
be
able
to
oust
the
striker
who
he
replaced
which
is
what
mackay
says,
the
employer
can
do,
but
that
repla
--
but
that
replacement
would,
in
the
event
of
layoffs
at
sometime
in
the
future,
also
have
the
additional
advantage
of
being
able
to
bump
out
other
strikers
who
were
not
replaced
during
the
strike
and
had
returned
for
work.
mr.
norton
j.
come
well,
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
demonstrates
the
very
serious
impediment
that
is
imposed
upon
employees
who
have
exercised
their
lawful
protected
right
to
engage
in
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
is
correct,
your
honor
and
for
that
reason,
we
submit
that
the
board
correctly
concluded
that
this
was
far
different
and
far
more
serious
than
the
right
to
permanent
replacement
that
is
recognized
by
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but
look
to
what
it
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
but,
your
honor,
look
also
what
it
does
to
the
exercise
of
the
right
to
strike.
i've
shown
you
on
the
facts
of
the
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
mackay
is
wrong.
i'm
saying
that
mackay
rests
upon
a
balancing
of
the
conflicting
interest.
the
interest
of
the
employer
in
running
his
business
as
against
the
impairment
to
the
right
to
strike,
and
at
some
point,
you
go
too
far
and
the
question
is
whether
the
board
was
reasonable
in
concluding
that
the
way
this
superseniority
policy
operates,
that
the
gain,
the
possible
gain
to
the
employer
is
so
outweighed
by
the
detriment
to
the
employees
and
the
impairments
of
the
right
to
strike
that
on
balance
it
is
not
privileged
by
the
act.
we
submit
that
the
board
was
reasonable
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
what
is
that,
your
honor?
mr.
norton
j.
come
i
think
the
board's
position
is
always
that
a
--
that
any
plan
which
would
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
whether
the
employee
remained
out
on
strike
or
not
in
terms
of
seniority,
by
its
--
by
its--
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norton
j.
come
yes,
your
honor,
and
it
also
violates
section
8
(a)
(3)
for
reasons
that
i've
set
forth
in
my
brief.
mr.
norton
j.
come
he
may
have
to
yield
to
the
striker
who
comes
back,
your
honor.
i'm
not
familiar
that
--
with
any
particular
case
on
that
point
but
--
mr.
norton
j.
come
that
may
well
happen.
thank
you.
