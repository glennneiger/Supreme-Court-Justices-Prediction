well,
isn't
that
--
doesn't
granting
seniority
rather
pay
in
comparison
to
people
losing
jobs?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
a
fellow
who
comes
back
--
the
union
member
who
comes
back
after
the
strike
with
standing
behind
20
years
of
seniority,
but
he
certainly
is
standing
--
at
least
he's
standing
there
in
the
plant.
and
then
some
of
his
friends,
they
aren't
even
back
to
the
plant.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
really
an
important
issue
of
that
point.
is
it
that
you
would
make
the
same
argument
whether
it
was
or
it
wasn't,
because
it
may
have
been
--
i'm
assuming
you're
arguing
the
case
on
the
assumption
that,
that
it
was
necessary
to
give
the
superseniority,
to
get
the
fellow
in
at
all,
and
in
that
sense,
it
was
essential
in
order
to
give
--
in
order
to
give
him
permanence
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
by
you
wouldn't
have
given
--
you
wouldn't
have
even
the
plan
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
come,
isn't
this
just
a
rule
of
permanency?
i
mean
that
the
thing
is
that
the
time
it's
really
going
to
operate,
is
raised
in
the
time
of
layoff,
the
fellow
seniority
doesn't
get
laid
off
and
seniority
has
the
more
permanent
job
than
the
fellow
without
seniority.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
--
that's
the
only
way
it
operates,
isn't
it,
in
terms
of
permanency?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
sure
i
gather
you're
really
saying
that
mackay
was
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
in
mackay,
would
you
say
that
--
would
you
say
that
at
the
moment
the
strike
started,
the
company
offered
jobs
to
permanent
replacements
or
look
suddenly
for
permanent
replacements
and
at
that
moment
offered
superseniority,
i
take
it,
you
would
almost
think
you'd
have
to
try
first
to
get
replacements
without
superseniority.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
must
--
you
must
--
you
would
think
they
offered
superseniority
at
the
very
outset
then
you
might
be
in
more
trouble
than
you
think
you
are
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
if
you
try
to
fail
the
--
then
succeeded
with
superseniority,
i
take
it,
you
think
you
are
on
--
in
the
preferential
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
that's
what
you
think
these
facts
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
that
sense,
you've
demonstrated
need.
