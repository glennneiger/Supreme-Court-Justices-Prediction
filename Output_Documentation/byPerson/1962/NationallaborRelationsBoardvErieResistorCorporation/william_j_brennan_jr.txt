(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
board
think
this
was
a
different
case
if
the
record
did
show
that
it
could
not
have
hired
without
making
this
offer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
think,
in
that
way
they
had
the
decision
as
if
they
had

for
20
years.
now,
was
that
for
all
purposes
are
only
for
layoff
and

justice

not
for

out
of
how
many?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
many
--
how
many
strikers
came
back
before
the
announcement
of
the
seniority?
justice

[inaudible]

[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,

mr.
come,
i
gather
there's
no
doubt
the
union
--
there's
no
question
that
the
union
status
has
exclusive
representative,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
is
it
--
is
it
the
board's
position
then
that
notwithstanding
there
was,
of
course,
no
agreement
than
existing,
nevertheless,
even
though
there
was
a
strike
going
on,
this
was
a
subject
matter
of
mandatory
bargaining?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
--
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
why
is
illegal
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
they
couldn't
unilaterally
adopt
it
that
is
the
subject
matter
of
bargaining
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
8
(a)
(5)
charge
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
case
we
had
last
year?
i
wrote
it,
i
can't
think
of
the
name
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
katz.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
--
does
that
have
any
relevancy
to
this
present
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
in
any
event,
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
the
board's
position
is
only
that
this
is
an
8
(a)
(1)
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
suppose
--
suppose
--
suppose
instead
of
offering
superseniority,
the
employers
said
they
will
pay
10
cents
or
15
or
25
cents
more
an
hour
than
we've
been
paying
so
anyone
would
take
employments.
would
that
be
the
same
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
have
the
same
effect,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
your
point,
mr.
come,
i
gather
is
that,
this
gives
the
new
employee
a
preference
not
only
to
the
fellow
who's
left
out
in
the
street
because
he
takes
his
job,
but
also
in
the
event
of
layoff,
it
gives
him
a
preference
over
someone
who
actually
had
come
back
to
work
after
the
strike,
but
who
now,
by
reason
of
this
20-year,
has
lesser
seniority
in
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
what
--
if
what
--
this
does
come
down
to
this
that
mackay
said
that
an
employer
may
displace
a
striker
if
it's
an
economic
strike,
but
mackay
did
not
say
that
it
may
also
displace
a
striker
who
returns
to
work
at
some
later
date
when
a
later
layoff
comes
along.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
position
is
that
to
the
extent
that
it
gives
the
employer
not
only
the
right
to
displace
a
striker,
but
also
gives
him
the
right
to
oust
on
a
later
layoff
someone
else
that
that
is
an
interference
and
made
a
--
with
the
right
to
strike
which
goes
too
far.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
doesn't
it
mean
to
credit
for
service
not
served?
it's
an
artificial
and
synthetic
seniority,
is
that
right?
