justice
potter
stewart
does
the
evidence
show
that
they
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
hire
these
people
without
making
such
assurances
to
them?
they
wouldn't
be
laid
off
as
soon
as
the
strike
is
over?
justice
potter
stewart
can't
you
give
a
little
more
precise
answer
than
that?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
in
the
board's
view
violated
the
statute
irrespective
whether
only
new
employees
are
involved
or
whether
as
in
this
case,
it
involved
both
new
employees
and
employees
out
on
strike?
justice
potter
stewart
it
didn't
use
that
word,
i
presume,
did
it?
the
management
didn't
use
that
word,
that
word
that
you
put
(inaudible),
“super-seniority”.
it
simply
said,
it
had
to
have
some
provision
to
see
to
it
that
these
people
would
be
more
than
temporary
employees

justice
potter
stewart
--
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
--
this
was
add
--
this
superseniority,
as
you
call
it,
was
added
at
a
time
as
justice
goldberg
has
pointed
out
when
there
was
no
collective
bargaining
agreement
in
effect
between
the
representatives
and
the
employers,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
it's
also
represented
in
the
briefs
for
the
--
for
the
respondent
that
continual
efforts
were
made
to
bargain
about
this
during
that
period,
during
that
interim
period.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
it
means
in
this
case.
that's
what
it
means
in
this
case.
you're
getting
somebody
credit
for
20
years
that
is
not
on
payroll.
