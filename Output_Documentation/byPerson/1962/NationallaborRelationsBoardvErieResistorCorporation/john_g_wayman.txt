mr.
john
g.
wayman
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
justices.
the
sole
issue
in
this
case
is
the
board's
declaration
of
what
it
calls
superseniority
is
per
se
unlawful
in
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(3)
and
derivatively
of
8
(a)
(1).
because
when
i
say
derivatively
of
8
(a)
(1)
because
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
case,
counsel
for
the
board
said
he
was
not
claiming
any
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
aside
from
this
so-called
superseniority.
and
there
is
not
a
word
of
evidence
in
this
case
unlike
almost
every
other
case
that
we
have
seen,
that
could
support
a
finding
of
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(1).
put
another
way,
in
the
absence
of
the
illegality,
the
per
se
illegality
of
what
the
board
called
superseniority,
erie
resistor
was
found
guilty
of
no
unfair
labor
practice.
the
affirmative
findings
are
that
it
was
not
guilty
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
that
it
did
bargain
in
good
faith,
that
it
had
a
lawful,
legitimate,
economic
motive
for
what
it
did.
up
until
the
day,
i
have
not
heard
the
word
per
se
mentioned
in
this
case
from
the
time
of
the
original
hearing.
this
suggests
to
me
as
i
suggested
to
the
circuit
court,
that
perhaps
the
board
is
not
proud
of
its
doctrine,
i
think
it
should
not
be
proud
of
its
doctrine
per
se.
furthermore,
as
it
clearly
appears
here
from
the
argument
made
by
my
worthy
opponent,
the
board
wants
us
to
argue
every
case
of
superseniority,
as
they
call
it.
they
want
us
to
say
that
superseniority
is
absolutely
privileged,
that
it
matters
not
what
the
circumstances.
under
mackay,
any
employer
can
grant
superseniority
just
as
he
can
replace
employees.
we
have
never
said
that.
we
do
not
say
that
now.
it
is
not
the
theory
of
this
case.
it
is
not
even
in
the
court
with
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
never
has
been.
this
case,
however,
was
selected
by
the
board
as
a
vehicle
to
establish
a
per
se
illegality
doctrine.
the
board's
counsel
said
so
at
the
outset
of
the
hearing.
it
upset
my
client
a
good
deal
to
be
in
the
middle
of
defending
himself
against
this
charge.
at
the
very
time,
the
general
counsel
issued
a
ruling,
sr
509,
in
which
on
identical
facts,
general
counsel
found
another
employee
not
even
required
to
answer
a
complaint
on
the
proposition
that
he
had
a
lawful
economic
motive
and
that
this
was
in
accord
with
mackay
radio
and
olin
mathieson.
we
didn't
think
that
was
the
way
a
board
ought
to
operate,
because
this
is
a
serious
matter
to
the
smaller
company.
it
involves
something
over
a
million
dollars
in
back
pay
and
that's
not
a
small
amount
of
money
to
a
company
that
employs
450
people
or
so.
this
is
a
threat
to
every
man
in
that
plant.
not
just
to
replacements,
but
the
strikers
who
have
returned
who
incidentally
are
all
working
today,
thanks
to
the
fact
the
company
has
recovered
from
this
strike
after
about
two
and
a
half
years
of
struggle.
the
complaint
against
erie
resisor
had
a
number
of
counts.
one
of
them
was
this
per
se
illegality,
which
was
the
real
reason
for
the
case.
another
was
that
in
adopting
the
policy
of
superseniority,
as
they
call
it,
their
purpose
was
not
to
save
the
plant
but
to
punish
the
strikers.
this
count
was
completely
disapproved.
there
is
not
a
word
of
evidence
to
support
it
in
the
record.
the
board
did
not
find
out
to
be
the
fact.
the
trial
examiner
found
that
not
to
be
the
fact.
consequently,
if
motive
be
the
test,
erie
resistor
is
not
guilty.
there
were
many
counts
for
refusal
to
bargain
in
various
ways.
after
all
the
hearing
that
we
went
through
in
the
trial
examiner's
report
and
board's
decision,
we
were
found
not
guilty
of
any
of
those
charges.
this
is
an
extraordinary
thing
in
a
case
where
an
employer
is
charged
with
the
violation
of
8
(a)
(3),
because
it
leaves
standing
naked
and
alone
this
per
se
illegality
of
what
the
board
calls
superseniority.
we
have
referred
to
the
trial
examiner's
findings,
page
59-a
of
the
record
and
page
64-a
of
the
record.
yesterday,
i
believe
the
question
was
asked
whether
or
not
there
was
a
finding
that
this
so-called
superseniority
was
necessary
to
get
replacements
to
come
to
work,
and
that's
a
rather
extraordinary
example
of
the
treatment
the
board
has
given
to
this
case.
perhaps
350
or
400
pages
of
these
thick
books
are
devoted
to
prove
that
it
was
necessary
to
give
what
they
call
superseniority
to
the
replacements
to
get
them
to
come
to
work
not
simply
because
it's
obvious
that
every
man
wants
a
permanent
job
and
not
a
temporary
one,
but
because
we
had
extraordinary
violence
on
the
picket
line
here.
and
as
you
will
see
if
you
read
the
record,
i
believe
it's
the
testimony
of
mr.
burton
that
many
people
who
were
hired
didn't
come
to
work.
they
were
afraid
to
come
to
work.
we
had
300
applications,
yes,
but
you
can't
run
a
plant
with
applications.
you
have
to
have
people
and
we
couldn't
get
the
people
because
they
would
not
risk
crossing
the
picket
line
and
risk
the
censure
of
these
neighbors
of
theirs
unless
they
were
assured
of
a
permanent
job.
it
was
necessary.
this
is
a
finding
of
the
trial
examiner.
the
board
did
not
reverse
that
finding.
instead,
on
page
19
and
not
29,
the
board
said
it
refused
to
consider
this
fact.
it
would
not
pass
upon
it
because
in
the
board's
view,
any
superseniority
is
illegal
per
se.
they
didn't
use
the
words
per
se,
of
course,
but
any
superseniority
is
illegal
and
therefore
they
didn't
even
consider
this
fact.
and
now
when
we
come
before
the
supreme
court,
i
heard
the
argument
made
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
have
this
additional
seniority
for
replacements
in
order
to
get
them
to
come
to
work.
we
could
only
wish
that
that
was
so,
but
it
is
not
so
and
the
record
will
not
support
such
a
statement.
now,
we
have
to
suggest
that,
and
i
think
we
have
in
our
briefs
suggested
that
the
board
hasn't
defined
what
it
means
by
superseniority
except
to
indicate
that
in
its
eyes
it's
something
pretty
bad.
after
about
20
years
of
dealing
with
labor
unions,
big
ones
and
little
ones,
and
negotiating
many
contracts,
i
don't
know
what
the
word
means.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
indeed
you
have,
sir,
in
fact,
you
and
i
on
occasion.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
i
will
certainly
do,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
that
is
sir,
your
honor,
but
seniority
itself
means
nothing
unless
it's
more
than
someone
else
has,
so
the
term
--
the
term
superseniority
to
me
is
meaningless
unless
it
is
defined
in
context
and
in
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case
and
contract
and
this
is
my
point
exactly.
i
can't
defend
the
term
superseniority
and
i
don't
intend
to.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
it
could.
it
could
mean
that.
i
don't
know
what
the
board
has
in
mind.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
in
respect
we
gave
them
credit
for
20
years
but
not
in
the
respect
that
you
use
seniority
generally
because
he
is
limited
in
his
ability
to
use
it.
all
this
so-called
superseniority
did
was
to
give
him
the
right
to
stay
in
the
plant.
it
did
not
fix
a
term.
in
other
words,
it
didn't
say
this
superseniority
will
go
on
for
a
year
or
a
day,
although
in
the
settlement
agreement,
they
did
said,
“it
would
continue
until
decided
by
the
courts,”
but
had
the
union
been
willing
to
bargain
on
the
matter,
perhaps,
we
could
have
done
something
with
that.
mackay
radio
doesn't
fix
the
term
either.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
was
no
way
at
all
for
this
company
to
assure
these
replacements
of
permanence
of
tenure
and
to
keep
the
promise,
which
i
suppose
everybody
would
want
them
to
do,
unless
they
either
gave
these
people
some
additional
seniority
beyond
the
date
that
they
were
hired,
the
artificial
credit
that
mentioned,
or
made
some
other
arrangement
with
the
union.
because
we
had
on
the
date
the
strike
began,
about
450
people
on
layoff
and
under
the
contract
that
was
in
effect
when
the
strike
began,
there
was
no
terminal
point
for
this
seniority.
it
just
went
on
and
on.
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
would
agree,
i
think,
this
is
an
unusual
feature
in
a
contract
that
there
it
was.
we
had
450
people
with
no
prospects
of
reemployment
but
having
seniority.
as
a
practical
matter,
certainly
it
would
make
no
sense
to
replace
people
on
layoff
because
nobody
would
take
a
job
simply
to
be
laid
off.
we
had
to
replace
people
that
were
working
and
if
we
did
and
if
we
give
the
replacement
seniority
just
from
the
date
they
started
to
work,
as
soon
as
the
strike
ended,
they
would
go
to
the
bottom
of
that
450-man
layoff
list
and
there
would
be
no
permanence
of
employment
the
fact
that
might
just
as
well
find.
this
was
a
problem
that
faced
this
company,
unlike
many
companies
it's
an
unique
situation.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
that
is
certainly
my
understanding
in
mackay,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
that
is
certainly
a
part
of
our
argument
because
that's
the
holding
of
all
the
circuit
courts
which
have
dealt
with
the
subject
of
superseniority.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
i
would
say
that
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
of
the
act
by
granting
additional
seniority
under
the
circumstances,
it
was
reasonably
necessary
for
the
employer
to
grant
this
or
to
use
this
tactical
device
in
order
to
obtain
the
replacements
and
this
is
what
the
courts
of
appeal
have
said.
they
have
never
said
there's
an
absolute
privilege
to
grant
superseniority.
i
wouldn't
expect
them
to.
we
didn't
expect
them
to.
the
company
in
this
case
complied
religiously
with
those
decisions.
it
followed
them
exactly.
they
had
good
counsel,
mr.
murphy.
he
told
them
they
should
follow
the
law
and
they
did
follow
the
law.
and
this
is
why
they
were
so
distressed
when
after
the
matter
was
all
over
having
followed
the
law
conscientiously,
they
find
themselves
accused
of
a
violation
of
the
law
and
not
permitted
to
make
any
defense
at
all.
this
is
the
thing
that
shocked
us.
this
is
the
narrow
point
in
this
case;
not
whether
or
not
the
board
correctly
found
facts
because
it
didn't
find
any
facts.
it
said
it
didn't
have
to
consider
the
facts.
all
additional
seniority
for
replacements
is
unlawful.
that's
the
proposition.
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
accept
that
proposition.
the
court
properly
said,
in
violation
of
8
(a)
(3),
motive
is
an
indispensable
factor
and
so
it
is
under
every
case
that
has
been
decided
in
the
courts
of
appeal
or
in
the
supreme
court.
let
us
consider
now
what
the
company
might
have
done
in
this
situation.
it
might
have
simply
replaced
these
people,
said
nothing
at
all
to
the
union,
and
gone
ahead
and
kept
them
out
after
the
strike.
it
could
have
replaced
every
one
of
the
strikers,
which
would
have
broken
them.
it
could
have
simply
not
negotiated
a
contract
containing
seniority
because
the
contract
had
expired
and
after
the
expiration
of
that
contract,
there
was
no
seniority.
to
the
company's
everlasting
credit
it
did
none
of
these
things.
it
never
ceased
to
try
to
make
a
contract
with
the
union.
it
never
refused
to
sit
down
with
the
union
and
try
to
make
a
contract
that
had
some
usually
satisfactory
seniority
arrangement.
it
is
not
true
that
the
company
insisted
on
superseniority.
the
word
“superseniority”
was
put
into
mr.
farrell's
mouth,
but
if
you
look
at
page
156-a
of
the
record
and
161-a
of
the
record
as
examples
of
mr.
farrell's
efforts
to
make
this
clear,
he
said,
“we
took
a
positive
position
where
we're
going
to
have
to
have
some
sort
of
protection
for
these
people
in
the
way
of
giving
them
job
assurance
that
we
have
told
them
they
would
have.”
he
did
not
say
superseniority
and
at
page
161-a,
he
was
asked
about
superseniority
by
general
counsel
and
he
said,
“i
object
to
superseniority
per
se
because
my
company
said
the
company
consistently
evidenced
its
willingness
to
negotiate
with
the
union
as
to
the
form
of
the
assurance
would
take.”
in
this
particular
case,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
company's
effort
to
keep
a
lawful
promise
to
the
replacements
that
they
would
not
be
discharged
when
the
strike
was
over.
now,
they
could
have
done
this
with
--
excuse
me
sir.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
if
they
did,
your
honor,
the
board
did
not
consider
it
an
unfair
labor
practice
because
this
promise
was
made
before
may
the
28th
and
the
board
said
there
was
--
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
up
to
that
time.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
i
would
say,
sir,
that
that
is
correct
in
any
case
in
which
you
replace
employees
with
permanent
replacements.
this
is
always
true.
it
makes
it
much
more
difficult
to
bargain.
there's
no
question
about
it.
but
this
is
not
due
to
the
particular
case
we
have
here.
this
is
true
of
every
case
in
which
you
have
permanent
replacements
because
the
union's
ultimate
position
was
all
the
replacements
have
to
be
discharged.
well
that
made
it
very
difficult
to
get
a
contract,
but
again,
to
the
company's
credit,
they
did
get
a
contract.
the
strike
did
end
and
strangely
enough,
well,
they're
criticized
for
it,
the
record
shows
clearly
that
they
hired
only
so
many
permanent
replacements
as
they
absolutely
had
to
have
in
order
to
survive.
when
this
college
let
out
in
june,
they
hired
college
boys
and
told
them,
“this
is
temporary.”
they
used
clerks
who
make
awfully
poor
production
people,
i
might
say,
and
sometimes
labor
relations
men
who
are
worse.
and
they
try
to
get
by
with
any
method
they
could
without
displacing
any
of
their
striking
employees,
but
if
this
plan
didn't
operate,
it
would
die
and
it
almost
did
die.
this
was
no
question
of
just
building
up
the
profit.
this
was
a
question
of
surviving.
what
was
done
here
was
purely
defensive,
but
really
no
choice.
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
dreadful
fact,
the
company
still
tried
to
bargain
with
the
union,
it
never
took
the
position
that
the
union
is
out
or
break
the
union.
it
wouldn't
make
the
contract
of
the
union
exactly
the
contrary
is
true.
instead
of
condemning
a
company
like
this,
it
should
be
commended.
this
is
not
to
say
there
was
no
problem.
indeed,
there
was,
and
there
still
is,
but
i
do
believe
it's
a
kind
of
a
problem
that
could
have
been
solved
by
collective
bargaining
as
the
union
had
been
willing
to
bargain.
i
want
to
say
one
word
too
but
the
emphasis
that's
been
placed
on
the
additional
seniority
granted.
my
friend,
mr.
come
suggests
in
his
presentation
that
perhaps
the
purpose
of
this
grant
of
additional
seniority
was
to
entice
strikers
to
come
back.
that
is
absolutely
unsupported
in
this
record.
the
record
shows
that
the
contrary
is
true.
this
company
carefully
avoided
an
invitation
or
enticement
to
the
strikers
to
return,
but
when
they
did
or
if
man
who
wanted
to
come
back
to
work,
the
company
didn't
say,
“no,
you
can't
do
it,”
but
the
need
for
replacements
was
not
to
get
the
strikers
to
abandon
the
strike,
it
was
to
get
strangers
and
outsiders
to
come
in
to
work
and
this
was
the
only
reason
that
this
policy
was
adopted.
furthermore,
the
policy
was
adopted
only
after
about
11
unsuccessful
negotiating
meetings
in
which
it
appeared
that
there
was
no
chance
of
getting
the
union
to
agree
to
any
arrangement
that
would
allow
the
replacements
to
stay
at
work.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
it
is,
sir.
the
notice
itself
or
several
notices
on
may
the
3rd,
the
company
sent
a
letter
to
all
its
employees,
strikers,
and
others,
telling
them
that
on
may
the
6th
or
7th,
they
would
begin
to
hire
permanent
replacements
and
that
anybody
who
is
replaced
could
have
his
job
only
to
that
point
then
he'd
have
no
job.
then
they
began
to
bargain
with
the
union
on
the
very
first
day
they
hired
a
replacement,
suggesting
different
ways
of
handling
this
but
not
getting
any
where.
on
may
the
28th,
they
handed
this
so-called
20-year
proposal
to
the
union.
the
union,
of
course,
rejected
it
along
with
everything
else,
but
oddly
enough
on
may
the
30th,
the
union
got
on
the
television
station
and
broadcast
this
all
over
erie.
the
company
has
--
had
said
this
is
confidential,
we're
trying
to
bargain
on,
but
the
union
got
on
the
television
and
said,
“this
is
the
company's
policy.”
so
on
that
day,
the
union
broadcasted
and
then
people
did
indeed
began
to
come
in,
not
by
any
announcement
on
our
part,
but
by
an
announcement
on
the
union's
part.
finally,
on
june
the
10th,
a
letter
was
sent
out
and
published,
saying
that
the
policy
had
been
adopted
and
on
june
the
15th,
a
notice
was
posted
on
the
bulletin
board.
those,
i
believe,
are
the
notices
concerning
the
policy.
no
special
letter,
which
i
am
aware
of,
was
sent
to
the
strikers,
but
if
the
striker
came
in
and
said,
“i
want
to
go
to
work”,
we
said,
you
can
go
to
work.
we
would
be
glad
to
have
them
of
course.
it's
not
by
any
special
inducement.
in
this
respect,
i
should
like
to
answer
one
other
question
that
was
asked,
whether
or
not,
this
differs
from
offering
say
replacement,
an
additional
10
cents
per
hour.
yes,
it
does
in
our
view
because
offering
a
replacement
an
additional
10
cents
per
hour
has
nothing
to
do
with
his
permanence
of
tenure.
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
a
permanent
replacement
and
a
strike
breaker.
we
do
not
believe
we
have
no
favor
for
strike
breakers.
if
i
want
to
hire
a
strike
breaker,
this
is
the
way
i
would
do
it.
i
would
offer
him
a
big
bonus
to
come
in
and
work
during
the
strike
with
the
understanding
that
he
can
get
out
as
soon
as
the
strike
is
over.
this
is
a
strike
breaker.
but
if
i
want
--
mr.
john
g.
wayman
well
it's
a
distinction
that
congress
made.
i
think
it's
a
very
real
one,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
think
there
are
two
keywords
in
what
you
said
to
do
what
is
necessary.
in
other
words,
i
think
that
the
decisions
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that
you
must
demonstrate
a
need
not
simply
that
you
--
i
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
but
you
had
a
genuine
need,
not
something
subjective
but
objective
through.
and
this
we
offered
and
this
was
never
refuted.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
if
that's
the
definition
that's
put
on
it,
yes,
but
whenever
you
say
do
what
is
necessary,
then
i
think
you
come
back
into
the
definition
of
these
various
courts
of
appeals.
if
your
purpose
is
simply
to
punish
the
strikers,
it's
unlawful.
if
your
purpose
is
solely
to
operate
the
plant,
and
i
think
you
ought
to
demonstrate
a
need
to
do
it,
then
it's
lawful.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
he
has
that
right.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
indeed
he
does.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
i
don't
think
it's
irrelevant.
i
think
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
man
who
operates
because
he
has
to,
to
survive
and
here
i'm
talking
about
defensive
as
opposed
to
offensive
weapons,
economic
weapons,
there
is
a
difference.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
or
under
mackay.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
kind
of
weighing
that
the
board
ought
to
do
whenever
they
declare
something
per
se
unlawful.
this
is
balancing
for
congress,
not
for
the
board.
however,
i
do
say
this
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
operating
the
plant
and
hiring
replacements,
a
distinction
made
in
mackay.
you
may
operate
your
plant
even
though
it's
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike,
but
you
may
not
hire
permanent
replacements
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
strike
and
this
is
a
very
significant
difference,
but
we
met
the
test
in
mackay,
every
one
of
them.
we
satisfied
them
all
on
this
record.
unless
this
is
per
se
unlawful,
we
were
guilty
of
no
wrong.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
i
do
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
you
must.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
well,
i
think
we
are
not
in
trouble
now.
we
would
be
then,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
i
believe
that
is
entirely
within
the
law,
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
indeed
they
do.
there
can
be
no
other
conclusion
drawn
from
this
record.
mr.
john
g.
wayman
yes,
sir.
