mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
i
would
like
to
take
the
first
few
minutes
of
my
time
to
put
this
case
in
little
better
perspective.
following
the
injury
to
this
man
reed,
he
first
brought
an
action
in
personam
against
waterman
steamship
corporation.
waterman
steamship
corporation
was
the
owner
of
the
ship
upon
which
he
had
been
working
when
he
was
injured.
there
was
a
motion
by
waterman
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
condition
which
caused
injury
had
arisen
after
the
time
that
waterman
the
owner
had
transferred
possession
to
my
client
pan
atlantic
under
a
demise.
and
the
opinion
was
filed
by
judge
kirkpatrick
which
is
in
this
record,
ruling
on
that,
and
judge
kirkpatrick
said
that
he
--
the
district
court
said
that
he
could
not
at
that
time
dismiss
because
all
of
the
facts
were
not
clear.
however,
he
did
point
out
that
it
was,
it's
at
page
19
that
opinion
justice
black,
he
did
point
out
that
it
was
perfectly
clear
law
that
for
a
condition
which
arose
after
the
demise
there
could
not
be
personal
liability
upon
the
owner.
now
the
owner
would
be
liable
for
a
condition
or
an
infirmity
or
a
defective
existed
at
the
time
he
leased
it
to
pan
atlantic,
but
not
for
something
that
pan
atlantic
itself
caused
during
the
time
it
was
in
possession
and
control
under
the
demise.
now,
the
very
day
that
the
suit
against
waterman,
the
in
personam
action
against
waterman
was
dismissed,
the
devise
of
a
libel
against
the
ship
in
rem
was
filed.
now,
i
think
it
is
important
that
we
note
that
there
has
been
a
judgment
and
no
appeal
from
that
judgment
in
the
in
personam
action,
reed
versus
waterman
steamship
corporation,
so
that
under
the
usual
rule
of
res
judicata
that
has
been
determined
here.
there
is
no
personal
liability
of
waterman.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
since
the
barnstable
case
your
honor,
its
cited
in
the
briefs.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
you
did
not
reach
this
question.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
no
sir,
in
pichirilo
and
guzman,
you
decided
on
the
ground
that
there
was
not
a
demise.
i
believe
mr.
justice
clark
wrote
that
opinion
on
that
which
you
are
holding,
you
noted
this
case
in
the
court
below.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes
your
honor
that
was
a
subject
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
dissent
and
i
don't
recall
whether
you
joined
in
that
or
not
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
but
this
point
was
reserved
at
that
point.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
that
was
the
reason
you
granted
certiorari.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
perhaps
i
don't
understand
which
question
is
foreclosed
your
honor.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
think
that
the
liability
of
waterman
was
involved
and
i
don't
mean
waterman
but
i
mean
the
owner.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
was
involved
in
pichirilo
versus
guzman.
as
i
recall
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
pichirilo
held,
first
that
there
had
been
a
device
from
out
of
the
owner
and
therefore
that
the
owner
no
longer
owned
and
no
longer
controlled
and
operated
the
ship
and
that
the
demise
had
been
into
the
longshoremen's
employer.
now
what
this
court
held
in
that
case
if
i
understand
this
decision
was
that
the
evidence
there
was
not
sufficient
to
show
a
demise
out
of
owner
into
employer.
therefore
owner
being
still
in
possession
and
control
was
liable
for
unseaworthiness.
now
that
is
my
understanding
of
that
case
sir.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
before
the
court
really
does
not
require
that
it
reach
this
point
for
all
time
and
for
all
purposes,
because
the
question
really
is
whether
congress
may
alter
the
maritime
law
and
subsidiarily
whether
congress
has
in
fact
altered
the
maritime
law
in
this
situation.
we
really
have
here
a
case
where
personal
liability
has
been
extinguished
by
statute.
there
has
been
discussion
in
my
advisory's
oral
argument
this
morning
and
i
believe
it
was
you
mr.
justice
goldberg,
you
were
speaking
about
the
contract.
now
the
contract
to
indemnify
in
this
situation
which
is
in
the
record,
beginning
at
page
55,
actually
that
part
of
it
is
at
56
a.
this
contract
between
my
client,
pan-atlantic
the
employer,
and
the
owner
of
this
vessel
is
nothing
more
nor
less
than
a
restatement
of
the
law.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
if
the
court
please
i
am
a
stevedoring
company,
pan-atlantic
is
a
stevedoring
company
it
is
also
a
ship
owner.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
we
are
also
a
ship
owner
of
other
ships,
we
chartered
this
one,
but
as
a
regular
part
of
pan-atlantic's
operations
it
does
its
own
stevedoring
work,
it
does
not
use
an
independent
stevedoring
contractor,
we
are
not
in
any
--
by
any
means
unique
in
that.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
oh
yes
that's
an
in
personam
liability.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
the
longshoremen
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
well
under
certain
circumstances.
yes
if
they
breach
their
warranty,
but
let's
say
the
owner
has
furnished
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
well
i
don't
see
that
--
yes
that's
in
spite
of
the
longshoreman's
act
but
that's
based
upon
a
--
this
court
has
said
that's
based
upon
a
contractual
relationship
which
has
been
voluntarily
entered
into.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir
i
say
this
that
congress
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
no
i
don't
say
that.
i
say
that
congress
has
intervened
and
validly
limited
my
liability
by
statute.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
his
remedy
is
restricted.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
as
i
view
the
law
it
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
understand
that.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
that
is
one
result
of
my
argument
put
that
way,
but
i
say
this
sir
that
congress
in
the
longshoremen's
act
has
given
to
an
employer
a
certain
immunity
if
he
pays
and
provides
compensation,
and
that
any
steamship
owner
may
that
he
chooses
be
his
own
stevedoring
and
a
great
many
of
them
do.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes
sir.
no
question
about
it,
in
my
mind
it's
been
settled
since
1933,
i
believe,
there
is
decision
in
the
court
circuit
and
there
are
whole
group
of
lower
court
decisions
about
it,
this
court
had
never
squarely
ruled
upon
in.
but
it
was
samuels
versus
munson
line
in
the
fourth
circuit
came
up
about
seven
or
eight
years,
i
believe
seven
years
after
the
compensation
act
was
first
enacted.
that
was
the
first
case
which
to
our
knowledge
said
that
a
steamship
company
who
would
normally
be
liable
to
a
longshoreman
injured
on
board
or
let
say
in
those
days
it
was
negligence,
let's
say
the
negligent
maintenance
was
precluded
from
recovery
because
congress
had
stepped
in
and
had
provided
that
the
employer's
exclusive
liability
would
be
that
provided
by
the
act
and
that
has
been
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes
sir,
it's
right.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
you
are
right
sir.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
think
that
is
always
the
same
sir.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
that
mr.
freedman
said
that
sir.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
mr.
freedman
was
consistent
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
mr.
--
no.
no,
mr.
freedman
was
consistent.
he
says
that
there
is
liability
in
rem
in
both
instances
and
that
the
uniform
trend
of
this
--
uniform
line
of
decision
in
the
lower
courts
is
body
that's
--
a
law
that
goes
back
into
1933
is
wrongly
decided.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
where
the
steamship
owner
sir,
does
his
own
stevedoring
he
is
not
liable
at
an
action
to
common
law
under
the
diversity
clause
nor
is
he
liable
at
a
--
to
a
third
party
action
in
admiralty.
the
remedy
is
been,
i'd
say
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
not
in
that
situation,
if
i
as
a
ship
owner
employ
my
own
crew
and
own
my
ship
or
taking
demise
charter
of
my
ship
and
i
also
employ
my
own
longshoreman,
i
say
congress
has
intervened
and
that
this
court
should
not
and
i
would
submit
cannot
alter
that
situation
and
i
don't
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir,
section
905
of
the
compensation
act
is
the
act
which
--
i
don't
mean
to
point
a
finger
and
i
apologize
i
do.
section
905,
since
the
act
was
first
amended
in
19
--
or
first
enacted
in
1926
has
to
my
knowledge
been
amended
only
once.
now
that
was
fairly
recently
about
1959
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly.
there
was
then
no
attempt
and
no
effort
to
change
this
result
of
the
body
of
case
law
which
goes
back
to
samuels
versus
munson
line
in
a
fourth
circuit
which
includes
smith
versus
the
mormacdale
in
the
third
circuit
and
some
other
cases
cited
in
the
briefs
in
other
courts.
there
was
no
effort
to
change
that.
now
the
only
expansion
of
the
protection,
if
you
want,
we
can
put
it
my
way
or
the
only
change
in
section
905
will
--
was
to
expand
the
protection
mr.
justice
goldberg
and
to
include
as
a
beneficiary
of
this,
shall
i
say
immune
from
liability
clause
not
only
the
employer
but
any
individual
fellow
employee.
i
think
that
resulted
out
of
an
attempt
where
grace
line
had
its
own
stevedoring
division
out
on
the
west
cost
and
was,
they
were
faced
with
this
body
of
case
law
and
they
sued
the
captain
individually
in
state
court
--
in
washington
i
believe
in
those
decisions
sir.
the
result
of
that
attempt,
while
it
was
--
if
i
may
say
so
squelched
judicially,
there
was
an
amendment
to
the
--
this
section
of
the
compensation
act
but
since
1926
to
my
knowledge
that
is
the
only
amendment
or
the
only
attempt
to
amend
this
section.
in
other
words
i
take
it
sir
that
it
is
congressional
policy
that
there
shall
be
immunity.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir
i
cannot
honestly
answer
that
question.
i'm
sorry
that
i
cannot.
we
now
have
come
to
the
question
of
what
other
similar
situations
have
resulted
in,
as
for
example
whether
congress
can
wipe
out
or
expunge
what
would
ordinarily
be
an
in
rem
liability
in
any
other
situation.
before
i
leave
that
may
i
go
back
to
the
contract
situation?
a
moment
ago,
i
said
that
the
--
this
i
want
to
emphasis,
i
said
that
the
contract
here
was
merely
declarative
of
the
general
maritime
law
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
court's
decision
i
believe
one
we
could
go
today
in
a
case
called
dixie
lien
drilling
or
something
like
that,
clearly
supports
our
position.
in
other
words
the
common
law
ever
since
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
barnstable,
about
1901
has
been
that
if
i
take
a
ship
under
a
demise,
i
must
return
it
free
and
clear
of
liens.
i,
the
charterer,
i
must
return
it
to
the
owner
free
and
clear
of
liens,
that
was
the
effect
of
the
barnstable
decision.
now
i
take
it
that
the
provisions
of
this
contract
only
restate
that
law
and
that
turning
it
around
had
there
been
in
this
contract
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
pan-atlantic
to
covenant
that
it
would
not
return
the
ship
free
and
clear
of
liens
which
its
acts
might
have
been
imposed
upon
it,
in
other
words
make
the
owner
pay
even
though
he
was
out
of
possession
when
the
wrong
was
done
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
wrong,
i
say
would
run
a
foul
of
this
court's
recent
dixie
lien
decision
and
the
decisions
which
preceded
it
such
bisow
versus
--
well
bisow
is
all
i
can
remember
and
southwest
--
western
molasses
case.
i
think
you
run
afoul
of
a
public
policy
where
you
try
and
if
that
had
been
an
attempt
there
which
there
wasn't,
to
by
contract
change
the
general
maritime
law,
this
contract
states
what
the
general
maritime
law
is.
we
must
–
we
the
charterer
must
indemnify
the
owner
under
both
the
general
maritime
law
and
the
contract.
we
have
attempted
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
no,
i
don't
have
to,
no
sir
i
was
simply
saying
that
it
was
the
common
law
and
it
couldn't
have
been
otherwise.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir
i
represent
the
demise
or
demisee
stevedoring
company,
i
do
not
represent
the
owner
but
both
--
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
it
might
well
mr.
justice
white,
although
it
wouldn't
have
to,
because
although
my
opponent
urges
you
to
go
back
to
the
early
body
of
decisions
and
he
refers
to
smith
versus
mormacdale
which
he
says
was
wrongly
decided
and
ask
that
you
say
something
in
this
decision
which
would
wipe
out
the
effect
of
those
decisions.
i
don't
think
you'd
have
to.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
the
owner
stevedore
--
not
in
this
court,
no
sir.
as
i
said
there
is
a
body,
there
is
a
body
--
the
whole
body
going
back
to
1933
of
lower
court
law.
now
i
say
mr.
justice
white
this,
that
there
are
a
number
of
analogous
situations
where
congress
has
enacted
statues
which
have
been
interpreted
as
i
urge
that
this
one
be.
let
me
give
you
the
illustration
of
the
so
called
fire
statute.
there
is
a
statute
which
says
that
the
owner
who
has
used
due
diligence
shall
not
be
liable
to
cargo
which
has
been
damaged
by
fire
on
board
a
ship.
that
case
came
up
to
this
court
under
this
situation.
the
owner
had
taken
advantage
and
been
discharged
under
the
fire
statute.
the
cargo
owner
sued
the
ship
in
rem
and
said,
ha,
ha,
the
statute
says,
you,
the
owner
are
exempt
if
you
meet
these
requirements,
but
your
ship
is
not
exempt.
and
mr.
justice
black,
you
cited
the
language
from
that
decision
in
your
decision
in
the
continental
grain
versus
barge
fmb
something
or
other.
you
quoted
from,
and
extensively
quoted,
from
this
consumers
import
company
versus
what
i
called
kkk,
a
decision
written
by
mr.
justice
jackson
in
which
you
specifically
said
that
a
liability
such
as
this
was
like
talking
in
riddles,
how
could
a
person's
property
be
liable
when
by
statue
his
personal
liability
had
been
exempt?
now
the
question
comes
up
also
in
this
situation,
what
did
congress
mean
when
it
used
in
section
905
of
compensation
act
the
words,
i'll
get
them
exactly,
“the
liability
of
the
employer
shall
be
exclusive
and
in
place
of
all
other
liability
of
such
employer
to
the
employee,
otherwise
entitled
to
recover
damages
from
such
employer
at
law
or
in
admiralty
on
account
of
such
injury.”
now,
in
the
case
of
the
canadian
aviator
which
my
opponent
relies
upon,
the
question
came
up
as
to
what
congress
meant
when
in
the
public
vessels
act
it
had
used
the
language
at
law
or
in
admiralty.
and
in
this
court's
decision
in
that
case
it
made
it
very
clear
that
when
congress
used
the
terms
at
law
or
in
admiralty
it
was
using
in
admiralty
in
the
broad
generic
sense
and
it
didn't
simply
mean
admiral
--
liability
in
a
proceeding
in
admiralty
in
personam.
that
it
meant
to
include
the
in
rem
proceeding
in
admiralty.
in
other
words,
it
was
not
simply
giving
you
a
little
bit
and
then
taking
the
same
thing
away
from
you
because
for
this
court
say
that
the
congress
has
the
power
and
did
in
fact
exempt
an
employer,
the
individual
from
in
personam
liability,
but
yet
to
say
that
property,
which
is
hit
shall
be
sold
as
my
adversary
urges
to
pay
is
really
a
riddle,
which
this
court
has
consistently
over
the
years
refused
to
apply
in
its
full
vigor
of
the
language,
which
people
urge
for
it.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
oh!
sir,
if
this
court
is
going
to
say
that
congress
does
not
have
the
right
to
limit
the
liability
of
an
employer
and
is
going
to
say
in
that
broader
language,
then
there
is
no
question
about
it
applies
to
the
owner,
it
applies
to
the
owner
pro
hac
vice
and
i
would
sugges.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
oh,
yes,
clearly.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
i
don't
get
any
additional
comfort
at
all
sir.
now
if
when
you
read
my
adversary's
brief
you
note
that
at
page
13
he
argues
the
question
of
warranty
and
he
says
that
the
longshoreman's
act
really
created
--
sorry
expunged
in
personam
liability
and
then
he
goes
on
to
talk
about
worthy
in
this
situation.
now
if
you
are
really
talking
about
a
liability
of
an
inanimate
object
in
the
rem,
it
seems
to
me
grossly
inconsistent
to
speak
in
terms
of
warranty.
what
you're
really
doing
if
you
follow
that
line
of
argument
is
applying
the
old
law
of
deodand,
you
are
condemning
the
thing
which
has
done
something,
but
why
then
cannot
congress
expunge
that
liability
and
subsidiarily
did
not
expunge
that
liability
in
this
compensation
act.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
sir
if
the
defect
that
existed
at
the
time
that
the
charter
was
entered
into
waterman
would
be
liable
in
personam
or
unseaworthiness
this
to
thing
under
the
decided
case
i
don't
question
that.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
both.
oh
no
wait
a
minute,
is
the
charter
the
employer
in
your
question?
oh
no,
then
the
employer
of
the
charter
would
not
be
liable,
but
waterman
would
be
liable
in
personam
sir.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
that
would
depend
on
the
planks,
it
could
have
–-
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
under
the.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
because
they
have
reached
their
warranted
--
another
provision
of
the
charter
when
they
turn
this
over
an
unseaworthy
ship,
unquestionably,
but
they
would
be
liable
in
personam
if
they
furnished
an
unseaworthy
ship
to
this
longshoremen.
in
other
words,
unseaworthy
at
the
time
they
delivered
to
his
employer
and
two
weeks
later
let's
say
he's
hurt
as
a
result
of
it,
he
could
sue
waterman
in
personam,
i
don't
question
that
and
i
do
say
and
i
don't
think
waterman
could
recover
indemnity
against
pan-atlantic
under
that
situation.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
waterman
never
was
the
employer
sir.
mr.
t.
e.
byrne,
jr.
that
brings
it
more
to
the
conventional
situation,
you
can
state
it
in
those
terms
and
that
someone
else
would
also
happen
to
be
the
charterer
and
would
be
protected
because
he
was
the
employer
by
the
provisions
of
the
compensation
act,
but
the
right
against
the
owner
would
then
exist
in
my
view.
some
argument
was
made
by
mr.
freedman
a
few
moments
ago
about
one
ship
corporations
and
mortgages
and
i
must
say
i'm
just
unable
to
follow
how
that
gets
into
this
situation.
either
you
have
a
congressional
statute
which
gives
an
immunity
in
this
situation,
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
corporation
has
one
ship
or
ten
and
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
are
mortgaged
or
not.
i
just
cannot
see
the
relevancy
of
the
argument
that
was
attempted
to
be
made
on
that
point.
just
in
closing,
i
want
to
say
that
in
the
brief
i
--
there
are
a
number
of
instances
where
congressional
legislation
has
changed
the
result.
i
have
in
oral
argument
only
referred
to
the
fire
statute.
it
would
for
example
be
so
in
a
limitation
of
liability
proceeding.
the
act
there
would
permit
the
ship
owner
to
limit
the
liability
of
a
marine
disaster.
the
act
there
only
speaks
in
the
terms
of
the
in
personam
liability
of
the
owner.
given
this
situation
a
collision
let's
say
and
the
owner
goes
in
and
his
liability
is
limited
and
he
has
satisfied
that
liability.
the
ship
is
then
sold,
if
my
adversary's
position
be
correct,
then
after
that
sale
or
perhaps
even
without
a
sale,
a
separate
in
rem
action
can
be
instituted
against
the
owner's
property.
this
creeps
into
sovereign
immunity
cases,
as
this
court
has
held
in
a
whole
series
of
decisions,
where
government
vessels
were
involved
during
the
period
of
both
government
ownership
and
demise
to
the
government.
some
were
returned
to
their
owners
at
the
end
of
the
demise,
some
were
sold
and
then
attempts
were
made
to
enforce
the
in
rem
liability
and
this
court
struck
them
down.
this
court
has
not,
i
submit,
in
other
than
what
mrs.
gilmore
and
black
referred
to
is
rather
[inaudible]
ever
sustained
the
concept
that
there
was
a
separate
in
rem
liability
when
liability
in
personam
had
been
expunged
by
the
statute
or
otherwise
and
that
should
be
i
think
decision
of
this
court
here.
thank
you.
