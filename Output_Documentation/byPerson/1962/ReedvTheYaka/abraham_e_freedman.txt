mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
precise
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
a
longshoreman
may
sue
a
vessel
in
rem,
where
the
vessel
is
not
owned
by
his
employer,
but
where
it
is
bareboat
charted
by
the
employer
and
where
the
injury
was
caused
by
an
unseaworthy
condition
created
by
the
or
during
the
tenure
of
the
bareboat
charter.
briefly
waterman
steamship
company
owned
this
vessel
the
yaka,
and
bareboat
charted
it
to
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation.
pan-atlantic
also
does
stevedoring
operations,
and
while
the
vessel
was
in
the
port
of
philadelphia
in
the
course
of
the
unloading
operation,
pan-atlantic
caused
some
staging
to
be
brought
onboard
the
vessel
pallets,
which
were
defective
and
this
man
while
working
broke
through
one
of
the
pallets
and
was
injured.
he
sued
the
vessel,
the
contention
here
was
that
he
was
bound
by
the
longshoremen's
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act,
he
sued
the
vessel
in
rem.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes
sir
your
honor.
he
received
compensation
from
the
insurer
for
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation.
he
brought
a
suit
against
waterman
as
the
owner
of
the
vessel,
but
did
not
pursue
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
dismissed
on
a
ground
that
the
unseaworthy
condition,
which
is
alleged
to
have
caused
the
accident
occurred
during
the
period
of
the
charter
so
that
the
owner
himself
had
no
control
whatsoever
over
the
condition
nor
had
no
part
in
creating
the
condition
or
maintaining
it.
so
that
--
and
that
was
not
pursued,
so
that
the
specific
issue,
which
is
here
involved
is
whether
or
not
the
longshoremen
can
pursue
the
vessel
in
rem
or
whether
the
pan-atlantic
as
the
employer
and
also
bareboat
charter
precludes
this
man
from
pursuing
the
vessel.
there
are
a
number
of
other
side
issues,
which
i
would
like
to
develop
as
we
go
along
sir.
the
district
court
held
that
the
vessel
was
unseaworthy
and
he
charged
the
vessel
itself
with
liability
apart
from
any
liability
of
waterman
or
of
the
pan-atlantic
steamship
corporation.
he
held
that
the
compensation
act
did
not
apply.
he
also
did
not
apply
the
doctrine
of
the
smith
versus
mormacdale
case
about
which
i
will
say
considerably
more
in
a
moment
or
two,
in
which
case
the
court
--
for
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
where
the
owner
himself
was
also
the
employer,
then
the
longshoremen
could
not
pursue
the
vessel,
because
in
effect
he
would
suing
the
owner.
in
the
smith
versus
mormacdale
case
that
was
the
situation.
here,
it
was
one
big
step
further
on
where
it
was
not
the
owner
who
was
the
employer,
it
was
a
bareboat
charter.
so
that
judge
clary
speaking
for
the
district
court
held
that
bareboat
charter
was
not
an
owner
and
therefore
he
was
not
exempt
or
rather
he
meant,
it
was
not
barred
by
the
compensation
act,
he
could
proceed.
he
also
held
that
there
was
indemnity
over
from
pan-atlantic
to
the
waterman
steamship
corporation
for
the
--
rather
to
the
vessel
for
the
injury
and
for
the
damage
caused
by
the
injury,
since
pan-atlantic
was
responsible
for
the
accident,
for
the
unseaworthiness
itself.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
ultimately
yes,
your
honor.
as
between
--
there
was
a
contract
of
indemnity
between
pan-atlantic
and
waterman
so
that
pan-atlantic
would
be
responsible
ultimately,
under
its
contract
between
these
two.
your
honors
will
find
and
i
think
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
this
liability
under
this
contract
for
indemnity
does
not
affect
the
rights
of
third
parties
particularly
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
that
case
came
specifically
before
this
court
in
pope
&
talbot
versus
hawn,
h-a-w-n,
where
this
court
said
that
the
contract
of
indemnity
cannot
take
away
any
rights
from
the
longshoreman,
which
he
may
have
against
the
vessel
or
her
owner.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
in
this
case,
there
was
your
honor.
there
was
a
charter
party,
which
contained
a
contract
of
indemnity
in
it.
although,
there
are
other
cases
which
say
that
there
are
five
contracts
of
indemnity
to
do
the
vessel
--
to
do
the
work
properly,
to
do
the
work
safely.
so
that
in
any
case
i
would
think
that
there
was
either
an
express
or
implied
in
this
case,
the
charter
party
itself
contained
a
contract
of
indemnity,
an
expressed
contract
of
indemnity.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
your
honor.
unless
waterman
is
liable
for
the
torts
of
the
vessel
itself,
that
was
a
question
that's
been
posed
many
times.
many
cases
have
said
that
unless
the
owner
himself
where
he
charters
it
has
some
hand
in
the
creation
of
the
unseaworthy
condition,
he
bears
no
responsibility
for
it.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
i
will
mention;
barnstable
for
one
and
a
number
of
others
would
say
that
the
owner
time-charter
or
rather
bareboat
chartered
his
vessel
has
no
control
over
it.
he
is
relieved
and
the
suit
itself
must
proceed
in
rem
against
the
vessel
itself.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
taking
the
smith
versus
mormac
case
one
step
further,
whereas
in
mormac
case,
judge
staley
speaking
for
the
majority
at
that
time
held
that
the
suit
against
the
owner
or
suit
against
the
vessel
was
in
essence
a
suit
against
the
owner
and
therefore,
the
compensation
act
barred
the
claim,
that
is
the
claimant
in
rem.
the
court
of
appeals
here
reversed
on
that
ground
but
incorporated
a
new
doctrine
into
the
law,
namely
that
in
every
rem
action
there
is
got
to
be
a
accompanying
personal
liability
in
personam
from
other,
either
from
the
owner
or
in
a
part
of
the
charter
or
someone
else.
in
other
words,
there's
got
to
be
an
accompanying
personal
liability.
this
was
something
new
in
the
law.
this
was
first
developed
i
think
in
the
first
circuit
by
judge
aldrich
speaking
for
the
first
circuit
of
court
of
appeals
in
the
pichirilo
case.
i
think
that
case
was
argued
here
sometime
ago
and
a
companion
case
was
argued
just
last
week.
in
any
event,
two
judges
dissented
from
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
judge
biggs
held
that
the
decision
was
in
violation
or
in
direct
conflict
with
this
court's
opinion
in
the
pinar
del
rio
and
also
in
the
sieracki
case
and
judge
staley
concurring
in
the
dissent
with
judge
biggs
also
pointed
out
that
he
was
the
author
of
the
smith-mormacdale
case
and
this
did
not.
he
dissented
also
in
the
ground
that
the
smith
case
did
not
extend
beyond
the
actual
owner,
did
not
extend
to
a
charter
and
no
matter
what
he
was,
he
was
not
an
owner
and
therefore,
he
could
not
claim
the
protection
as
an
owner
against
the
libel
in
action
in
rem.
now
from
almost
the
beginning
of
the
time
in
this
country,
a
lien
against
the
vessel
has
been
recognized
and
has
been
the
basis
for
an
action
in
rem
against
the
vessel
itself.
every
action
in
rem
has
got
to
have
a
lien
against
it
before
it
can
be
prosecuted.
perhaps
it
would
serve
a
purpose;
at
this
point,
i
would
just
take
a
half
a
moment
to
outline
the
difference
between
this
kind
of
a
lien,
a
maritime
lien
and
an
ordinary
common
law
lien.
we
all
know
that
an
ordinary
common
law
lien
arises
and
it's
based
on
the
possession
of
the
thing
itself.
a
maritime
lien
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
possession.
it
is
a
right
in
the
property
itself
regardless
of
whether
this
possession
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
as
soon
as
in
all
cases
of
personal
injury
to
people
who
are
lawfully
on
board
and
this
court
said
that
in
the
very
early
case
of
the
stevens,
the
john
g.
stevens
than
anybody
who
is
lawfully
on
board
and
suffers
personal
injury,
a
lien
arises
against
the
vessel
itself.
that's
a
secret
lien.
it's
an
inchoate
lien
and
becomes
perfected
as
soon
a
libel
in
action,
a
libel
in
rem
is
brought
to
a
conclusion,
to
consummation.
so
that
the
distinction
between
this
kind
of
a
case
between
a
libel
--
between
a
lien
under
the
maritime
law
and
the
common
law
lien,
which
we
generally
recognize
as
possession.
at
first,
the
common
law
lien
attaches
only
because
of
the
possession
of
the
thing
whereas
under
the
maritime
law
the
lien
arises
because
it
has
the
right
of
property,
the
thing
which
gave
rise
to
the
course
of
action
as
a
right
in
a
property
itself.
this
court
said
exactly
that
in
the
lotawana
in
the
very
early
case
in
1875,
where
in
considering
one
of
laws
of
court
in
1858,
rule
12,
the
admiralty
laws
was
amended
to
wipe
out
the
liens
in
connection
with
domestic
vessels
and
so
on.
on
the
theory
that
this
that
the
lien,
the
libel
–
the
lien
and
the
maritime
law
was
a
procedural
device.
in
1872,
that
law
was
amended
and
the
lotawana
--
this
court
and
the
lotawana
construed
it
and
said
that
actually
it
is
not
a
procedural
device,
that
is
the
lien
under
the
maritime
law,
but
it
is
actual
in
the
words
which
they
use
where
a
property
right
in
the
thing
itself.
and
that's
the
theory,
that's
the
bases
which
this
court
has
followed
right
down
the
line.
now
in
the
early
days,
tracing
the
development
of
this
lien,
we
find
it
interesting
to
note
from
even
in
the
decision
by
chief
justice
marshal
in
connection
with
an
embargo
in
the
little
charles
back
in
1880,
where
he
held
the
connection
with
an
embargo
of
the
vessel
itself,
they
held
that
the
vessel
is
the
personality
all
by
itself.
and
regardless
of
whether
the
owner
knew
what
was
happening
at
the
time
bareboat
chartered
it
or
whether
he
didn't
know,
didn't
make
any
difference,
the
vessel
itself
was
liable.
following
that,
we
find
an
opinion
by
justice
story
in
the
the
malek
adhel
in
1844,
reported
in
43
u.s.
in
connection
with
an
act
of
piracy.
the
vessel
was
taken
over
by
pirates
and
the
vessel
was
held
liable
there
despite
the
fact
that
the
owner
had
no
control
over
it.
the
vessel
itself
was
the
offending
thing,
the
court
there,
justice
story
and
justice
marshall
both
pointed
out
that
while
the
vessel
is
to
a
sense
inanimate,
yet
is
not
really
inanimate,
it
acts
and
it
acts
to
the
crew,
it
has
a
master,
it
reports
to
the
master
and
therefore,
it
was
the
offending
thing
itself
and
therefore
it
was
liable.
following
that,
we
have
another
series
of
decisions
from
this
court
in
the
barnstable
for
example,
where
the
vessel
was
bareboat
charted
and
the
court
--
this
court
quoted
in
the
opinions
of
mr.
justice
story
and
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
holding
that
the
vessel
was
in
itself
by
personality
and
therefore
was
liable
in
rem
for
its
own
acts
apart
from
any
other
consideration.
in
the
china,
this
court
reached
the
same
conclusion
where
a
vessel
was
required
to
take
on
a
compulsory
pilot
and
the
owner
there
was
absolved
because,
being
a
compulsory
pilot,
he
couldn't
be
responsible
in
personam
for
the
acts
of
the
compulsory
pilot.
however,
the
court
said
that
the
vessel
itself
was
responsible,
because
the
pilot
was
an
integral
part
of
the
vessel,
of
the
crew
or
the
vessel
itself.
and
therefore,
even
though
the
owner
himself
may
not
have
been
liable,
the
vessel
itself
was
in
rem,
under
the
basis
of
the
lien
theory.
justice
holmes
speaking
for
this
court
summarized
the
situation
quite
well
in
his
book
called
“the
common
law.”
and
he
again
--
in
reviewing
the
all
of
the
authorities
pointed
out
that
the
vessel
is
really
a
living
thing.
he
said
it
becomes
rational
when
we
consider
the
vessel
as
an
object
with
the
crew,
which
acts
through
the
master,
which
acts
through
the
crew
and
has
a
separate
personality.
my
friends
on
the
other
side
argued
that
justice
holmes
was
in
conflict
with
a
case
which
he
handed
down
in
the
eugene
moran
reported
in
212
u.s
in
1909.
and
they
quote
some
language
from
justice
holmes'
opinion
indicating
that
perhaps
he
was
critical
of
the
doctrine
of
the
liable
in
rem
of
the
lien
theory.
however,
my
friends
didn't
go
far
enough,
because
had
they
gone
a
little
further
and
looked
at
justice
holmes'
decision
at
the
decision
itself,
they
would
have
found
that
the
liability
was
posed
on
the
rem,
on
the
liability
of
the
ships
themselves.
there
were
four
vessels
which
were
involved.
had
there
been
in
personam
liability,
as
my
friends
would
indicate
the
owner
would
have
been
liable
either
for
his
share
probably
one
half
along
with
the
liability
of
someone
else.
instead
of
that,
mr.
justice
holmes
pointed
out
that
there
are
four
vessels
and
each
vessel
was
liable
for
the
accident
itself
or
for
the
collision,
each
one
on
so
and
so
it
was
a
separate
personality.
so
that
in
all
respects
justice
holmes'
opinion
is
clearly
consistent
with
what
he
said
in
“the
common
law”
and
clearly
consistent
with
the
theory
that
the
vessel
is
a
personality
and
that
a
liable
in
rem
rely
in
every
case
against
the
vessels
apart
from
any
liability
of
the
owner
or
anyone
else.
there
are
a
number
of
other
cases.
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
in
passing
that
my
friend
cite
--
say
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
aligned
itself
with
the
first
circuit
in
that
you
got
to
have
an
accompanying
liability
and
they
cite
for
that
proposition
noel,
n-o-e-l
versus
isbrandtsen
in
an
opinion
by
judge
sobeloff.
actually
they
are
incorrect
there
too,
in
that
case
the
vessel
was
taken
out
of
navigation,
the
vessel
was
not
in
commerce
at
all,
it
was
being
prepared
for
the
mothball
fleet.
so
it
was
out
of
navigation.
there
was
no
warranty;
this
court
held
that
in
the
west
case.
and
therefore
chief
judge
sobeloff
said
that
there
just
isn't
any
liability
either
for
unseaworthiness
or
negligence.
there
has
got
to
be
some
liability,
he
did
not
say
that
there
has
got
to
be
an
accompanying
liability
of
some
third
party
in
personam
as
my
friends
would
say.
actually
he
said
that
in
the
case
there
wasn't
any
evidence
of
negligence,
there
wasn't
any
evidence
of
unseaworthiness,
therefore
there
was
no
liability.
so
that
the
fourth
circuit
case
when
read,
indicates
that
it
is
in
complete
conformity
with
the
contention
which
we
urge
and
which
the
other
cases
that
this
court
has
handed
down
indicate.
this
court
said
in
the
canadian
aviator,
speaking
to
justice
reed,
versus
the
united
states
where
a
vessel,
or
a
merchant
vessel
following
on
orders
from
the
coastguard
struck
a
submerged
object
and
there
was
a
technical
question
involved
and
the
question
whether
the
united
states
was
liable,
because
the
vessel
itself
was
liable.
and
the
supreme
court
speaking
to
mr.
justice
reed
said
that
the
vessel
itself
was
liable,
it
was
a
person,
it
had
a
personality
just
as
any
person
in
rem
and
did
not
depend
on
any
liability,
any
accompanying
liability
on
the
part
of
any
owner.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor
it
is
in
a
sense
a
fiction,
but
when
we
look
at
the
principle
which
justice
holmes
handed
down,
which
justice
story
handed
down
and
which
chief
justice
marshall
handed
down,
it's
more
than
a
mere
fiction.
it
is
--
the
ship
is
a
living
thing
and
it
acts,
when
it
puts
out
to
sea,
the
master
is
in
complete
command
of
the
vessel,
it
acts
through
the
master
and
her
crew,
so
that
actually
while
in
a
sense
it
is
a
fiction
and
has
been
called
a
fiction,
all
of
the
courts
actually
referred
to
it
as
a
fiction.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
some
analogy,
but
i
would
say
when
an
automobile,
when
you're
put
out
with
an
automobile
from
your
home
or
some
place,
you
come
to
the
corner
and
you
stop
at
a
traffic
light,
you're
all
times
under
the
protection
of
the
police,
you
are
all
times
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
community.
when
the
ship
puts
out
from
the
shore,
there
is
no
such
protection,
there
is
no
such
discipline.
everything
rests
on
the
discretion
of
the
master
himself
and
the
crew
and
what
they
do.
they
may
encounter
a
storm
and
they
are
on
their
own
resources.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sometimes
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
no,
sir
i
do
not.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
that
it
was
incorrectly
decided,
yes,
your
honor.
i
do
because
the
court
there
combined
the
liability
of
the
master
and
in
essence
said
that
because
the
master
would
have
to
pay
the
judgment
and
it
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
enactment
of
the
compensation
act.
actually
if
congress
--
this
court
has
gone
at
the
rights
of
seamen
and
the
longshoremen
who
have
been
called
seamen
right
down
through
the
ages
and
they
have
never
surrendered
any
--
permitted
any
surrender
of
the
rights
of
any
longshoremen
except
under
the
most
clear-cut
circumstances.
now
if
congress
–-
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
of
course,
sir.
we
get
full
effect
--
i
would
get
full
effect
of
the
compensation
scheme,
but
this
was
against
the
owner.
i
might
point
out
here
your
honor
that
the
compensation
scheme
was
directed
only
against
the
stevedore
contractor
and
it
never
took
into
contemplation
the
fact
that
the
stevedore
contractor
is
also
the
owner.
these
are
two
separate
identities
and
i
think
that
there
is
considerable
consideration
that
would
have
to
be
given
if
this
question
was
squarely
before
the
court,
where
the
owner
himself
has
sued
in
personam
not
in
rem,
whether
the
owner
in
personam
could
claim
exemption
under
the
compensation
act
where
he
is
acting
as
a
ship
owner
as
distinct
from
his
actions
as
stevedore,
that's
not
in
this
case.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
agree
that
it
would
be
more
substantive,
but
as
i
said,
your
honor,
while
the
other
is
a
fiction,
yet
there
is
a
great
deal
of
substance
too,
so
it's
full
of
substance.
i
would
argue
this,
your
honor,
if
we
were
filing
a
suit
in
personam
against
the
owner,
which
i
think
we
would
have
right
to
do
and
bring
that
issue
squarely
before
the
court.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
to
go
that
far.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
go
that
far,
because
we
have
established
--
this
court
has
established
that
you've
got
a
right
to
an
action
in
rem
quite
apart
from
any
action
in
personam
that
you
may
have
against
the
owner
himself.
this
is
decided.
now,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
we
would
be
taking
on
an
added
burden
if
we
were
to
argue
that,
because
in
that
case
we
have
to
forget
about
--
we
do
not
have
the
basis
of
the
action
in
rem
to
fall
back
on.
had
we
not
had
it,
undoubtedly,
we
would
have
approached
it
on
that
basis,
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
against
the
bareboat
charter,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
both.
well
as
i
think
under
the
–
this
is
a
matter
of
contract,
either
express
or
implied.
and
i
think
here
there
was
an
express
contract
in
which
the
owner
himself
claimed
the
benefit
of
the
indemnity
agreement.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well,
sir.
if
we
see,
it's
really
of
the
owner
that's
involved,
we
are
ignoring
all
of
this
precedent
that
comes
down
through
the
ages
and
here
is
why
it's
important
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
probably
that
would
be
a
more
appropriate
way
of
putting
it.
the
owner
today
with
the
advent
of
the
corporate
device
where
many
shipowners
are
incorporating
or
organizing
corporations
only
for
each
ship,
and
then
when
something
happens,
it
could
be
a
major
catastrophe
on
board
a
ship
and
then
while
the
litigation
is
going
on
this
owner,
this
one
ship
corporation
could
assign
or
sell
the
vessel
to
some
other
individual
and
if
we
didn't
have
this
lien
against
the
vessel
itself
many,
many
people
although
they
would
have
a
right
to
recovery
could
never
recover
because
we
got
the
one
ship
corporation
and
this
is
a
prevailing
practice
today.
so
then
actually
it's
more
than
a
mere
friction.
we've
got
something
very
real
to
contend
with
you
know.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
ship
sir?
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
don't
quiet
understand
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
well
in
rem
action
the
ship
itself
would
pay
the
judgment,
if
the
money
wasn't
forthcoming
the
ship
could
be
sold
and
the
proceeds
used
to
pay
the
judgment.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
it's
true
in
any
attachment
case,
yes
sir,
but
there
are
differences.
where
you've
got
a
lien
against
a
vessel,
an
attachment
case
there
might
be
mortgages
ahead
of
you.
and
in
an
ordinary
attachment
case
then
you
might
come
in
last
and
never
get
paid
anywhere,
whereas
if
you've
got
a
lien
against
a
ship
in
a
priority,
you've
got
a
right
in
this
property
itself.
and
this
court
has
said
that
these
liens
for
personal
injuries
even
supersede
the
lien
of
the
mortgage,
just
as
wages.
so
there
actually
is
a
tremendous
difference
between
the
requirement
of
payment
from
the
owner
himself
and
looking
to
the
ship
itself
for
payment.
and,
as
i
said
with
advent
of
the
corporate
device
now
this
makes
the
situation
--
it
makes
it
so
much
more
necessary
to
maintain
this
rem
theory
and
not
to
expand
it
any
further.
precisely
the
same
situation
came
before
the
court
in
pacific
pie,
a
district
court
case
in
state
of
washington.
i
cite
it
because
this
court
adopted
that
principle
on
a
sieracki
case
in
328
us.
and
there
we
have
the
precise
situation
where
the
vessel
committed
the
tort
and
it
was
sued
and
the
court
there
held
that
it
was
a
third
person
and
this
court
cited
it
with
approval
in
sieracki.
this
court
also
in
monrosa
versus
the
carbon
black
incorporated,
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
brennan
where
there
was
a
bill
of
lading,
this
was
not
a
personal
injury
case,
there
was
a
bill
of
lading
in
which
there
was
a
jurisdictional
question
raised
as
to
where
the
owner
could
be
sued.
this
court
held
that
while
the
jurisdiction
of
the
owner
was
confined
to
certain
areas,
the
label
in
rem
could
be
maintained
where
it
could
be
before,
and
so
long
as
the
contract
itself
did
not
confine
the
ship
in
rem
to
the
same
jurisdiction,
the
libellant
was
free
to
bring
his
liable
and
rem
against
the
ship
itself
apart
from
any
right
that
he
might
have
had
against
the
owner.
here
again
and
this
was
a
very
recent
pronouncement
of
this
court's
indication
or
intonation
to
maintain
as
a
separate
entity,
the
liability
of
a
ship.
i've
already
discussed
the
smith
versus
the
mormacdale
opinion.
we
say
that
it
was
wrong.
we
think
that
this
court
should
reverse
it.
however,
the
particular
case
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
now,
goes
even
further
than
smith
versus
mormacdale.
here
in
the
particular
case
this
court
said
that
there's
got
to
be
an
accompanying
personal
liability
on
a
part
of
the
owner
or
someone
else
before
there
can
be
a
lien.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
law
for
that
other
than
this
decision
from
the
first
circuit
by
judge
aldrich.
but
it
is
in
conflict
with
all
the
decisions
which
i've
recited
to
your
honor,
none
of
which
require
a
personal
liability,
so
that
the
court
of
appeals
here
went
one
big
step
further
as
judge
staley
pointed
out
and
judge
staley
was
the
author
of
the
smith
versus
mormacdale
opinion,
he
dissented
from
the
majority
on
the
ground
that
unless
it's
the
owner
himself
then
the
smith
decision,
the
smith
doctrine
doesn't
apply.
i
would
like
to
point
out
before
i
conclude,
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
other
considerations,
some
differences
between
the
owner
himself,
real
differences
between
the
owner
and
what
my
friends
have
termed
the
owner
pro
hac
vice,
bareboat
charter
has
been
declared
or
has
been
used,
the
label
has
been
put
owner
pro
hac
vice,
but
he
is
really
not
an
owner.
if
your
honors
examine
the
charter
and
it's
--
the
relevant
portions
are
set
out
in
the
record,
you
find
that
there
are
many,
many
limitations
which
the
owner
puts
on
the
bareboat
charter
as
to
how
you
can
use
the
vessel
and
where
it's
got
to
go
in
a
period
of
time
and
so
on.
and
i
may
say
too
that
the
charter,
the
bareboat
charter
isn't
liable
for
the
mortgage,
she's
subject
to
the
mortgage.
if
the
owner
should
default
during
the
period
of
the
mortgage,
the
vessel
could
be
taken
away
during
the
period
of
this
charter,
so
that
it's
possession
is
not
complete
apart
from
any,
any
surrender
the
vessel
by
the
owner
himself
and
he
can't
do
anything
about
it
as
the
owner
might
be
able
to
be
do.
this
opens
the
door,
opens
--
stimulates
much
more
thinking,
many
more
ideas
as
to
the
differences
between
a
real
owner
and
an
owner
pro
hac
vice
as
my
friends
have
told
it
or
a
bareboat
charter.
if
the
court
please,
unless
there
are
any
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
few
minutes
remaining
for
rebuttal.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
thank
you
sir.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
if
the
court
please
this
court
has
already
many
time
stated
that
even
though
in
personam
liability
has
been
expunged
so
to
speak
at
least
in
tact
a
liability
in
rem
and
i've
said
at
those
cases,
i
think
i
made
references
before.
mr.
justice
goldberg
previously
said,
is
there
anything
in
the
compensation
act
which
preserves
the
right
of
action
against
third
persons.
section
33
of
the
compensation
act
expressly
preserve
the
longshoreman
all
right
of
action
against
all
third
persons
other
than
the
owner,
the
employer
himself,
this
and
libel
in
rem
is
a
third
person.
this
court
in
sieracki
adopted
the
principle,
they
adopted
and
endorsed
the
case
of
the
pacific
pine
where
precisely
the
situation
involved
an
owner's
stevedore
and
there
the
longshoreman
was
permitted
to
bring
a
libel
in
rem
against
the
employer
himself
as
owner
of
the
vessel.
and
this
case
as
i
said
was
endorsed
by
this
court
in
the
sieracki
decision,
so
that
we
do
have
something
on
record
from
this
court.
mr.
justice
black
in
the
cannella
grant
case
did
not
do
as
my
friend
said.
mr.
justice
black
speaking
for
the
court
pointed
out
very
carefully
that
he
was
not
destroying
the
libel
in
rem.
he
was
not
destroying
the
lien
at
all.
all
he
was
doing,
if
the
court
please,
made
it
very
clear
that
the
course
of
action
was
the
same,
that
the
witnesses
were
the
same,
and
therefore
there
was
everything
to
be
said
for
transferring
both
in
rem
action
and
in
personam
action
both
at
the
same
place
where
that
could
be
tried
at
the
same
time.
and
implicit
in
that
opinion
is
the
contention
that
the
in
rem
action
must
be
preserved.
justice
black
said
in
that
case
that
there
was
a
good
reason
for
the
rule
originally
and
there
was
a
good
reason
for
it
today
and
the
very
fact
that
any
transfer
of
the
case
under
section
1404
(a).
so
to
bring
the
in
rem
and
in
personam
action
together
as
i
said
indicates
that
this
court
attempts
to
preserve
the
in
rem
action
and
the
lien
which
goes
along
with
it.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes
sir.
i
would
say
not
despite,
i
would
say
because
of
the
longshoreman's
act,
because
the
section
33
of
the
longshoreman
act
expressly
preserve
that
longshoreman
rights
against
third
persons
and
in
pacific
--
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
the
owner,
the
ship
itself
is
a
third
person.
that's
what
the
court
said
in
the
pacific
pine
and
this
court
endorsed
that
except
that
that
proposition
in
sieracki.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes
sir
no
question
about
that
in
my
mind.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
don't
know
that
i
need
to
go
that
far
your
honor.
i
think
that
strictly
on
the
basis
of
the
in
rem
action,
the
lien
against
the
vessel
itself
would
be
sufficient.
i
think
that
the
longshoreman's
act
is
restricted
only
to
the
employer-employee
relationship.
anything
outside
of
that
is
not
within
the
act.
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
i
may
say
by
analogy
the
case
of
the
pinar
del
rio
where
an
action
was
brought
under
the
jones
act
against
the
ship
itself
and
this
court
said,
that
you
couldn't
have
an
action
against
the
jones
act,
under
the
jones
act
against
the
ship
because
no
lien
was
created
by
the
jones
act.
thereby
--
but
you
could
sue
the
owner
in
personam,
thereby
separating
the
liability
of
the
employer
from
the
liability
of
the
ship.
you
have
two
separate
and
distinct
liabilities.
when
you
sue
the
ship
you've
got
one
liability
but
you
only
–
you've
got
an
entirely
different
liability
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
i
think
that's
correct
your
honor.
the
owner
when
he
does
the
stevedoring
work
is
wearing
two
hats
and
i
don't
think
that
congress
ever
intended
that
he
should
be
permitted
to
evade
his
responsibility
as
a
ship
owner
when
he
acts
under
the
guise
of
a
stevedore
coming
in
and
becoming
the
employer
which
as
a
matter
of
fact,
could
be
a
paper
transaction
and
generally
in
most
instances
it
would
be.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
only
by
implication
your
honor.
the
legislative
history
deals
with
the
liability
of
a
stevedoring
contractor,
it
does
not
deal
with
the
liability
of
a
ship-owner
at
all
and
it
contemplated
--
by
two
separate
and
distinct
categories
as
they
always
have
been
right
down
the
line.
the
stevedores
do
their
work
and
the
ship-owner
do
their
work
and
if
the
ship
owner
doesn't
provide
a
sea
worthy
vessel
he
has
a
non-delegable
duty
for
which
he
is
responsible.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
abraham
e.
freedman
yes
your
honor
that's
my
theory,
those
are
my
contention,
thank
your
honor.
