mr.
peyton
ford
i've
got
about
five
minutes,
do
you
want
me
to
proceed
on
those?
at
the
outset,
i'm
not
going
to
tell
the
court
what
fee
mr.
connor
is
paying.
i'm
going
to
get
this
--
maybe
i
can
briefly
get
this
back
in
perspective,
at
least
i'll
try
to.
in
september
1952,
mr.
simler
retained
mr.
connor
to
contest
a
certain
will
filed
by
mr.
simler's
sister
which
left
him
$1
under
the
will.
in
september,
a
supplemental
agreement
was
made
and
that
was
entered
into
setting
forth
what
a
reasonable
fee
was
to
be.
the
first
letter
said
they
would
be
paid
a
reasonable
fee
to
be
decided
by
the
county
court
or
any
court.
that
contract
didn't
contemplate
a
jury
in
passing.
but
in
september,
after
mr.
conner
had
consulted
other
lawyers
and
determined
not
only
to
start
an
action
in
the
county
court
of
oklahoma
county,
but
also
in
the
united
state's
district
court
in
challenging
the
right
of
a
corporation
to
take
land
outside
of
the
corporate
city
limits.
those
matters
had
been
discussed
at
great
length.
he
told
mr.
simler
and
this
is
in
the
record
of
the
complication
of
the
litigation,
his
necessity
to
hire
other
lawyers
to
assist
the
man.
at
that
time,
they
agreed
upon
a
scale
of
the
fees
starting
i
think
at
25
to
33
and
a
50%
if
it
went
to
the
higher
courts.
it
also
provided,
there's
no
recovery,
there
is
no
fee.
following
the
september
letter,
litigation
was
began
in
the
county
court
on
october
2nd
and
in
the
federal
district
court
on
october
the
14th.
this
litigation
continued
through
both
federal
and
state
courts
through
19
separate
trials
and
appeals.
and
it
wasn't
until
may
1957
that
it
was
finally
included,
that's
without
reference
to
any
litigation
concerning
the
attorney's
fees.
the
federal
court
ruled
first
in
1953,
in
petitioner's
favor.
on
november
1954,
the
oklahoma
county
court
entered
a
decree
awarding
the
farm
to
petitioner.
thereafter,
the
respondent
where
the
country
court
have
awarded
certain
expenses
and
legacies
paid
out
of
the
proceeds
from
the
farm
that
petitioner
got,
the
respondent
took
that
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
and
recovered
some
$73,000
for
the
petitioner,
in
other
words,
he
does
not
have
to
be
paid
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
farm.
the
petitioner
finally
took
the
farm
beginning
sometime
in
1954
though
this
other
litigation
continued
after.
and
it
wasn't
until
after
he'd
had
the
farm
in
his
firm
possession
that
there
was
any
question
ever
came
up
about
this
attorney
fees.
it
was
then
by
some
legal
[inaudible]
domain,
this
farm
just
came
to
and
there
was
no
work
done,
there
was
no
litigation,
there
were
19
separate
proceeding,
it
did
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
three
times,
the
supreme
court,
twice,
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
court
twice.
somehow,
this
request
just
came.
and
following
some
long
period
of
disagreement
in
which
mr.
grigsby
was
paid
off,
in
which
another
lawyers'
interest
satisfied
in
which
the
proceeds
to
more
runs
--
county
farm
amounting
some
60
odd
thousand
dollars
was
used
to
pay
mr.
grigsby's
fee
of
$12,000
which
left
him
a
lien
on
the
farm.
and
from
those
proceeds,
minus
the
$12,000,
mr.
simler
took
$25,000,
mr.
conner
took
$25,000.
in
the
court's
order
granting
summary
judgment,
it
was
a
specific
order
requiring
on
equitable
accounting
for
any
moneys
that
may
or
may
not
have
been
paid,
that
wouldn't
be
if
necessary,
would
on
derogation
of
the
50%
awarded
to
the
petitioner.
now,
these
names
are
clearly
admitted
by
the
petitioner.
and
i'm
speaking
toward
the
motion
for
the
summary
judgment
and
the
grant
of
the
summary
judgment.
the
terms
of
the
september
instrument,
they're
not
in
question.
the
petitioner's
execution
thereof,
that
is
in
question,
poor
performance
by
the
petitioner's
obligations
under
that
contract,
in
fact
the
litigation
went
not
only
to
highest
court
of
oklahoma,
but
the
highest
court
of
the
land.
mr.
peyton
ford
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
briefly
refer
outside
of
the
mainstream
of
my
argument
to
several
matters
that
mr.
ogden
raised
yesterday.
one
is,
the
transfer
of
the
case
from
judge
wallis
to
judge
chandler.
on
page
81
of
the
record,
there's
a
letter
from
judge
wallis
to
the
clerk
of
the
united
states
district
court,
where
he
says
to
the
clerk,
“at
the
request
of
mr.
john
ogden,
one
of
the
attorneys
for
mr.
simler,
in
the
above
styled
case,
i
am
assigning
this
case
to
the
honorable
steven
s.
chandler
for
trial
and
disposition.
in
connection
with
mr.
ogden's
further
argument
as
to
the
reasonable
fee
and
so
forth,
in
his
deposition
at
105
of
the
--
106,
i
guess
in
--
of
the
record,
he
asked
this
question,
“alright
sir,
then
did
you
know
when
you
employed
mr.
conner,
what
a
reasonable
fee
was
or
wasn't
a
reasonable
fee?
you
put
in
there
a
reasonable
fee
to
be
fixed
by
the
court?”
“no,
but
i
trust
him
in
the
cost
in
there
that
we
would
if
we
couldn't
agree
on
a
reasonable
fee,
it'd
be
left
up
to
the
county
court,
the
court,
mr.
simler
or
any
other
court.”
as
to
the
question
of
federal
law
controlling
and
whether
the
respondent
was
or
wasn't
in
agreement
or
disagreement
with
it
on
the
prior
proceedings,
in
fact,
the
position
was
never
contested
one
way
or
the
other.
the
court
sent
this
case
back
to
the
tenth
circuit
as
i
read
their
ruling
for
the
tenth
circuit
to
decide
whether
state
law
required
a
jury
trial
or
non-jury
trial
and
the
tenth
circuit
in
obedience
to
this
court's
direction
held
that
it
was
a
non-jury
trial,
citing
the
southard
case
in
which
they
specifically
held,
overruled
the
haunstein
case
that
mr.
ogden
was
citing
at
the
conclusion
of
his
argument
yesterday.
however,
the
respondent
in
this
case
does
not
argue
that
the
federal
law
isn't
applicable
under
rule
56
in
an
action
for
finding
a
promotion
for
summary
judgment
in
portion
and
motion
for
summary
judgment
it
makes
no
difference
whether
it's
a
jury
trial
or
a
non-jury
trial.
now,
as
i
concluded
yesterday,
i
pointed
out
that
under
the
action
for
--
under
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
the
petitioner
clearly
agreed
on
the
terms
of
the
september
agreement,
the
execution
of
it,
the
full
performance
by
--
of
the
contract
by
the
petitioner
and
that
the
litigation
was
taken
to
both
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
and
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
to
this
court
and
as
the
result
of
his
efforts
they
recovered
this
160-acre
farm
which
is
of
great
value.
as
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
granted
below,
the
court
held
three
very
extensive
hearings
on
it.
affidavits
were
filed,
depositions
were
taken
from
all
parties
present
at
the
signing
of
the
september
agreement.
in
petitioner's
counterclaim,
he
asked
that
the
september
agreement
be
set
aside
because
he'd
been
overreached.
in
support
of
this
position,
he
basically
alleged
only
three
things:
one,
his
age
which
is
74;
two,
his
inexperience
in
litigation
and
three,
the
fact
that
he
just
doesn't
want
to
be
bound
by
the
agreement.
some
subjective
state
of
mind
he
said
occurred
at
the
time
the
agreement
was
signed.
well,
of
course
that
can't
vary
the
terms
of
unambiguous
written
agreement.
mr.
peyton
ford
if
it
wasn't
agreement,
agreement
the
first
letter
wasn't
needed.
mr.
peyton
ford
and
a
consideration
for
this.
mr.
peyton
ford
this
was
a
mere
clarification
of
the
first
document
stating
--
the
first
man
said
a
reasonable
fee,
this
clarified
what
a
reasonable
fee
was.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes.
in
my
--
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
he
is
talking
about
the
--
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
he
is
talking
about
the
haunstein
case
which
this
court
in
effect
held
and
the
tenth
circuit
specifically
held
overruled
in
the
southard
case
overruled
the
haunstein
case.
and
the
first
--
i
think
the
most
important
consideration
is
that
for
now
being
upon
assumption
that
internal
oklahoma
law,
this
is
at
page
7
of
my
brief,
affirmatively
the
outlaws,
attorney
fees,
contracts
are
more
than
reasonable
notwithstanding
that
they
are
prescribed
in
an
otherwise
lawful
contract.
such
an
assumption
is
nowhere
asserted
to
prove
by
the
petitioner
either
below
or
in
the
--
or
in
his
brief
before
this
court.
at
any
event,
the
recent
decision
of
southard
makes
it
plain
that
such
assumption
is
not
the
substantive
law
of
oklahoma.
the
only
precedent
respondent
cites
is
holstein
which
i
said
has
been
overruled
but
in
the
subsequent
case,
the
oklahoma
court
stated
and
i'm
quoting,
“since
we
hold
that
the
deed
and
the
attorney
client
contract
are
binding.
there
is
no
necessity
to
discuss
the
value
of
the
services
on
quantum
meruit.”
and
when
they
had
to
say
that
in
attacking
such
an
instrument
that
the
--
it
was
the
action
was
equitable
in
nature
but
i'm
not
relying
upon
the
substantive
law
of
a
state
to
characterize
this
as
one
equitable
action.
it's
clear
under
the
federal
law
that
is
an
equitable
action.
mr.
peyton
ford
that's
right.
mr.
peyton
ford
that's
my
premise.
mr.
peyton
ford
so
far
as
the
substantive
law
of
the
state
though
concerning
when
you
reached
a
--
mr.
peyton
ford
--
the
reasonableness
of
--
mr.
peyton
ford
--
20
more
contract
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
i
meant
to
bring
that
up
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peyton
ford
under
state
law.
mr.
peyton
ford
because
the
tenth
circuit
has
relied
upon
state
law,
not
federal
law.
we
hadn't
met
the
question.
in
my
judgment,
now
you've
--
now
the
court
has
before
it
clean.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
if
you
want
to
follow
the
doctrine
of
constitution
(inaudible)
--
mr.
peyton
ford
it's
squarely
here
but
if
the
summary
judgment
was
properly
granted,
you
don't
reach
it.
mr.
peyton
ford
i
contend
the
court
of
--
my
contention
is
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
when
they
sent
it
back
to
the
court
for
trial
before
the
court.
mr.
peyton
ford
never
been
tried.
mr.
peyton
ford
no
sir.
they
sent
it
back
to
be
tried
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peyton
ford
that's
right.
mr.
peyton
ford
that's
right.
mr.
peyton
ford
that's
right.
and
i
say
that
because
the
seventh
amendment
is
the
only
amendment
that
has
any
so-called
historical
background
and
judge
friendly
in
a
recent
case
pointed
that
out
very
clearly
and
if
you
go
back
to
the
historical
background
under
the
seventh
amendment,
it's
only
those
trial
--
only
those
cases
that
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
by
common
law
in
1791
that
are
now
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
well,
at
common
law,
in
1791,
a
contract
between
a
client
and
a
barrister
was
not
enforceable
at
all.
though,
there
was
no
cause
of
action
but
following
in
another
step
under
federal
and
under
all
these
cited
cases,
an
action
to
set
aside
and
rescind
a
written
agreement
is
purely
equitable.
and
under
the
seventh
amendment,
that
is
not
triable
to
the
jury.
and
it's
an
equitable
proceeding
here
because
you
can't
reach
the
question
of
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
until
this
document
is
set
aside
or
modified
which
is
purely
equitable
in
nature.
so
anyway,
you
reach
it,
i
don't
think
you
can
reach
the
question
that
this
is
triable
to
a
jury.
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
it's
our
contention
that
there's
completely
no
evidence
of
fraud
in
the
case
that
as
i
have
previously
stated,
they
only
relied
upon
three
things,
his
age,
his
inexperience,
and
his
unwillingness
to
be
bound
with
the
contract.
mr.
peyton
ford
the
mere
allegation
--
mr.
peyton
ford
a
mere
allegation
of
ultimate
facts
--
mr.
peyton
ford
--
and
conclusions.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
but
i
want
you
to
consider
that
the
court
in
grating
this
motion
to
summary
judgment
had
before
it
affidavits.
it
had
before
it
depositions
of
all
the
parties,
all
the
parties
were
present.
and
the
court
in
its
sound
discretion
and
this
court
must
recognize
some
discretionary
right
upon
a
trial
court
in
granting
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
now,
that
there
was
no
overreaching
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes.
mr.
peyton
ford
they
have
simply
didn't
exist
in
the
affidavit.
mr.
peyton
ford
not
as
he
stated,
no.
mr.
peyton
ford
that's
an
equitable
action,
certainly.
mr.
peyton
ford
without
to
--
mr.
peyton
ford
without
burdening
the
court,
i
think
this
is
clearly
stated
in
moore's
federal
practice,
volume
5
at
183
in
footnotes
2
and
5
on
the
question
justice
white
has
just
asked
me.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
that's
such
a
simple
question.
i
don't
know
why
i
can't
answer
it.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
the
common
law
action
in
this
type
of
case
i
contend
is
equitable
--
is
triable
to
the
court
if
we
didn't
have
rule
56
in
the
summary
judgment
doctrine
and
i
contend
that's
applicable
--
mr.
peyton
ford
this
is
a
--
this
is
a
construction
in
his
counterclaim
to
set
aside
the
contract
providing
for
these
great
--
graduating
fees
from
25%
to
33%
to
50%.
mr.
peyton
ford
the
original
complaint
was
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
to
find
out
how
much
--
who
owed
who
and
how
much.
mr.
peyton
ford
and
how
much.
mr.
peyton
ford
i
would
say
so
but
--
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
if
it
is
in
nature
of
accounting,
it
could
be
equitable.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
there
is
an
accounting
question.
mr.
peyton
ford
no,
but
we
filed
just
an
answer
to
his
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
we
counterclaimed
and
pled
that
september
25th
agreement
which
he
and
his
--
the
petitioner
in
his
original
action
only
pled
that
july
(voice
overlap).
mr.
peyton
ford
certainly
because
he
can't
get
to
the
first
letter
until
the
second
contract
is
construed
by
the
court
and
that's
not
a
jury
question.
mr.
peyton
ford
no.
set
aside.
mr.
peyton
ford
and
that's
an
equitable
question.
mr.
peyton
ford
no,
i
don't
think
so
in
this
case
because
the
very
--
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
there's
a
variation
--
mr.
peyton
ford
there's
a
variation
on
the
theme
here.
in
this
case,
the
july
contract
specifically
provided
that
the
reasonableness
of
the
fee
would
be
decided
by
a
county
court
or
any
other
court.
it
never
contemplated
the
jury
in
the
original
agreement.
mr.
peyton
ford
i
don't
think
it
was
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right.
it
was
the
--
it
was
embodied
in
the
contract
and
even
in
his
deposition
in
this
cause
the
petitioner
never
questioned
that.
i
just
read
that
to
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
i'd
say
that.
mr.
peyton
ford
i'm
sure.
have
a
lot
to
do
with
it.
mr.
peyton
ford
[inaudible]
mr.
peyton
ford
no,
but
i
just
stated
to
justice
black,
he
have
never
contended
including
his
deposition
that
the
summary
judgment
he
was
ever
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
under
his
july
agreement.
and
under
the
historical
test
that
i
first
mentioned
which
i'm
coming
back,
there
was
no
right
to
a
trial
by
a
jury
or
any
right.
it
was
only
moral
obligation
under
english
common
law
for
the
enforcement
of
attorney
embarrassed
with
the
contract
and
is
--
it's
simply
to
me
the
--
probably
the
best
analogy.
mr.
peyton
ford
if
you
can't
sue
--
you
can't
sue
--
mr.
peyton
ford
well,
no
but
their
actions
--
analogies
to
it,
actions
to
set
aside
the
verdict
notwithstanding
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
i
think
that
perhaps
the
best
analogy
is
you
can't
sue
the
sovereign
without
his
consent.
that
was
the
common
law
in
1791
when
the
seventh
amendment
was
enacted.
there
are
many
cases
where
the
sovereign
has
given
his
consent
to
be
sued
but
the
courts
have
consistently
held
that
that
doesn't
give
the
right
to
a
trial
by
jury
that
similar
to
this
cause
of
action
in
the
--
neither
one
of
them
existed.
now,
that
they
have
come
in
to
being
since
the
seventh
amendment
whether
it
be
by
the
sovereign
in
an
act
of
grace
or
whether
it
be
just
the
change
of
the
law,
that
doesn't
change
your
right
to
a
trial
by
jury.
mr.
peyton
ford
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
peyton
ford
in
the
dairy
queen
case
of
the
petitioner's
defense
to
a
breach
of
contract
was
the
subsequent
oral
modification
of
the
contract
and
the
court
held
there
that
while
there
was
such
an
oral
modification
raised
factual
issues
triable
to
the
jury,
i
don't
think
that's
our
case
at
all.
in
our
case,
there's
never
been
any
question
as
the
alleged
september
contract
or
what
it
is
or
its
terms
and
conditions.
the
only
question
raised
is
sought
to
be
set
aside
by
fraud.
but
in
this
point,
the
underlying
facts
aren't
contested.
and
even
if
they
weren't,
the
dispute
would
be
subsumed
within
the
overall
claim
set
aside
for
written
instrument
which
is
equitable
in
nature.
we
have
no
dispute
on
the
facts
here.
in
dairy
queen
you
had
an
attempt
to
modify
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
there
are
several.
there
was
--
the
moore
citation
i
gave
you
had
several
cases.
i
don't
have
them
--
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
i
will
get
the
decision,
there
is
one
in
--
it's
cited
in
the
moore
citation
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
22
and
some
subsequent
cases
following
that
on
page
23.
am
i
right?
i'm
wrong,
that
was
another
citation
on
moore,
that
must
be
the
183
citation.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes,
that's
it.
i
was
looking
at
the
wrong
moore.
those
are
the
cases
and
the
case
is
cited
in
those
two
footnotes
i
mentioned
on
moore,
the
full
text
in
moore
is
not
cited
here.
the
only
other
case
that
i
remember
mr.
ogden
mentioning
was
the
beacon
theatre
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
where
legal
and
equitable
claims
have
joined,
it's
improper
to
try
the
equitable
claim
by
the
court
ahead
of
the
issues
triable
and
the
jury
for
this
might
incur
of
the
litigants'
right
to
a
jury
trial.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
has
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the
beacon
doctrine
affects
only
those
cases
where
there's
an
issue
of
fact
common
to
the
legal
and
equitable
claims
and
that
isn't
true
in
this
case.
the
question
about
the
reasonable
attorney
fee
here
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
question
of
whether
the
september
instrument
was
fraudulently
induced.
and
furthermore,
the
reasonable
fee
claim
is
a
contingent
claim,
that
is
it's
not
an
--
it's
not
an
alternative
to
the
cancellation
of
the
contract,
that
is
the
reasonable
fee
claim
is
contingent
upon
the
cancellation
of
the
contract.
it's
a
claim
that
can
arise
only
after
it's
been
decided
that
the
september
instrument
was
to
be
set
aside
and
beacon
doesn't
reach
that
question
on
purely
contingent
claims
and
in
that,
i
call
your
attention
to
the
case
of
damsky
v.
[inaudible]
cited
on
page
--
its
289
f.2d.
that's
same
case
that
i
cited
in
connection
with
historical
construction
of
seventh
amendment
decided
by
judge
friendly
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
peyton
ford
sir.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes
sir,
within
the
ambit
of
the
given
factual
situation
in
this
case.
i
would
like
to
read
briefly
from
a
colloquy
between
the
court
and
mr.
ogden
that
was
referenced
to
102
of
the
transcript
where
the
court
is
doing
its
best
to
get
mr.
ogden
to
tell
him
what
other
evidence
he
has
to
offer
except
the
affidavits
and
depositions
filed
in
connection
with
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
court
says,
what
additional
testimony,
i
don't
want
to
know
what
it
is,
but
what
point
would
you
offer
it
to.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
we
would
offer
just
for
the
reasonableness
of
the
fee.
that
is
one
thing
we
would
do
because
we
think
that
would
be
proper.
next,
your
honor,
mr.
simler
has
testified
he
doesn't
desire
to
change
his
testimony
but
we
do
desire
to
corroborate
it
with
other
testimony
which
we
have
at
the
time
of
the
court.
now,
could
there
be
any
other
testimony
on
this
point?
well,
mr.
conner
and
mr.
simler
are
in
complete
disagreement
on
what
took
place.
there
were
only
two
of
them
who
were
there
but
if
the
court
please
i'm
not
saying,
“well,
there
are
other
people
there
both
charged
whose
testimony
you're
going
to
rely
upon
or
add
to
it.”
well,
i
think
i'm
going
to
rely
upon
mr.
arnold
britten
who
was
a
third
person
present.
mr.
britten
sued
mr.
simler
for
attorney
fee.
you're
going
to
use
mr.
britten
now,
what
are
you
going
to
prove
by
mr.
ogden
judge.
i've
got
his
deposition
as
i
recall
it,
he
testified
in
that
deposition
i
don't
attempt
to
remember
the
details,
but
as
i
recall
he
testified,
it
was
after
this
county
court
case
which
is
october
2
that
mr.
grigsby
got
up
the
idea
to
file
a
suit
in
a
federal
court.
mr.
conner
had
nothing
to
with
it.
are
you
willing
for
that
to
be
part
of
the
record,
mr.
bailey
who
was
representing
mr.
conner
then,
we're
willing
to
stipulate
that
the
deposition
be
filed
in
this
case;
his
affidavit
as
to
his
testimony
is
also
on
file.
the
court,
“what
about
his
deposition
there,
why
don't
[inaudible]
his
deposition
come
in.”
mr.
peyton
ford
i
don't
know,
this
is
a
160-acre
farm
in
caddo
county
which
is
in
the
so-called
a
cement
producing
area
of
oklahoma.
it's
got
oil
runs
of
about
four
--
350,000
and
40,000
a
month
--
mr.
peyton
ford
and
it's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peyton
ford
that
is
one
of
the
riches
producing
area
in
oklahoma
has
about
13
producing
sands
and
i
don't
know
how
many
been
touched
on
this
160.
mr.
peyton
ford
i
would
--
from
half
a
million
to
400,000.
mr.
peyton
ford
half
of
it.
mr.
peyton
ford
of
course,
there
are
some
--
some
didn't
pay
that
would
have
to
be
accounted.
mr.
peyton
ford
i
don't
know
what
the
exact
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peyton
ford
there
was
--
there
were
25
and
the
question
is
to
--
how
you
treat
some
12,000
but
the
services
of
any
other
attorneys
if
mr.
conner
hired
in
this
was
to
be
taken
cared
out
of
his
50%.
mr.
peyton
ford
yes.
mr.
peyton
ford
in
the
beginning,
they
filed
a
--
this
--
the
sister
of
mr.
simler
died
and
cut
him
off
with
$1
and
no
more.
that
was
when
he
went
to
mr.
conner.
he
filed
an
action
in
the
county
court
of
the
oklahoma
county
contesting
the
will.
that
was
on
october
the
2nd
at
1952.
on
october
the
14th,
1952
they
filed
an
action
in
federal
court
to
set
aside
the
will,
contending
that
because
this
was
a
corporation,
the
constitution
of
oklahoma
forbade
corporation
to
take
any
land
outside
of
the
city
limit
that
wasn't
used
for
corporate
purposes.
now,
that
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
twice
and
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
peyton
ford
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
twice.
ultimately,
it
was
determined
that
the
sisters
of
saint
francis
could
not
take
under
the
will,
therefore,
it
went
in
test
and
through
mr.
conner's
efforts
of
19
separate
proceedings,
mr.
simler
got
160
acres
in
caddo
county
which
we
have
just
roughly
placed
evaluation
on.
at
the
same
time,
while
the
county
court
admitted
the
factum
of
the
will,
it
was
a
federal
court
action
that
caused
ultimately
this
property
to
go
to
mr.
simler.
but
at
the
same
time
in
the
probate
action
in
the
county
court,
the
court
assessed,
“how
are
the
proceeds
of
the
farm,
certain
expenses
and
legacies
and
so
forth.”
mr.
conner
took
that
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
and
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
held
of
some
100
and
$10,000
or
$20,000
that
was
assessed
against
the
farm
not
the
estate
that
should
be
paid
from
these
--
$73,000
should
be
paid
from
the
estate,
not
the
proceeds
from
the
farm
and
in
con
--
i've
concluded
my
historical
seventh
amendment
question.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
say
anymore
than
that.
thank
you.
