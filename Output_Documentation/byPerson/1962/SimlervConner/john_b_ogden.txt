mr.
john
b.
ogden
if
your
honor
please
--
pardon
me,
john
b.
odgen
of
oklahoma
city
for
the
petitioner
and
in
this
case
presents
a
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
or
not
we
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
but
even
a
more
important
question
is
whether
or
not
when
you
go
in
the
federal
court,
the
state
law
and
the
state
constitution
applies
in
determining
whether
you’re
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
or
whether
you
use
the
law
of
the
state
of
the
forum
where
the
cause
of
action
arose.
in
this
case,
the
circuit
court
of
the
tenth
circuit,
twice
in
this
same
particular
case,
now
i
might
say
for
the
benefit
of
the
court,
that
this
case
has
now
been
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
three
times
and
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
once,
but
has
never
been
tried,
so
it
is
rather
unusual.
this
is
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
brought
by
mr.
simler
who
was
a
former
client
of
mr.
conner.
he
was
a
plaintiff
for
united
states
court
in
okalahoma
city.
mr.
conner
of
course
was
the
defendant.
the
case
was
originally
assigned
to
judge
wallace,
now
deceased.
he
held
we
were
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
i
represent
mr.
simler
and
we
had
asked
him
a
declaratory
judgment
action
for
the
court
to
tell
us
whether
we
owed
mr.
conner
anymore
money
for
lawyer
fees
or
not.
we
had
paid
him
$24,000.
we
had
paid
attorney's
--
paid
me
$7500
to
assist
mr.
conner,
had
paid
mr.
grigsby,
an
associate
of
mr.
conner's
who
had
a
28%
interest
in
mr.
conner's
fee,
$12,800.
mr.
simler
had
paid
to
the
opposing
lawyers
under
the
orders
of
the
county
court
of
oklahoma
county,
oklahoma
$46,000.
so
he
had
spent
$90,300
for
lawyer
fees.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
no,
the
reason
i
said
that,
if
the
court
please,
to
show
that
the
reason
was
necessary
to
find
our
whether
we
had
paid
out
enough
fees.
i
thought
the
court
would
probably
like
to
know
how
much
we'd
paid
out
to
see
that
we
did
have
a
real
reason
to
go
into
court
because
we
didn't
know
whether
we'd
paid
sufficient
fees
or
not.
so
in
the
suit
which
was
declaratory
judgment
action,
after
judge
wallace
transferred
the
case
over
during
his
lifetime
to
judge
chandler.
so
upon
the
first
hearing
before
judge
chandler,
judge
chandler
said,
“well,
i
will
not
give
you
a
jury
trial.”
now,
we
had
demanded
a
jury
trial
on
a
reply
in
our
complaint,
and
on
the
response
later
for
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
so
he
said,
“i
won't
give
a
jury
trial.”
so
then,
in
their
brief,
we
went
to
denver
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
file
an
application
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
require
him
to
give
to
the
petitioner,
mr.
simler,
a
jury
trial.
we
have
briefed
it
and
argued
it
in
denver
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
made
an
order
and
ordered
judge
chandler
to
give
us
a
jury
trial.
then,
when
we
came
back
there
before
judge
chandler
after
he
had
received
that
order,
he
said,
“well,
i
won't
have
any
kind
of
trial,
i
don't
know
he
used
the
word,
he
said
i'll
just
sustain
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
there
won't
be
any
trial
to
it.”
so,
it
will
be
like
in
difference;
jury,
non-jury.
so
that
is
what
he
did
in
the
court.
we
made
--
we
were
forced
to
make
bond
then
and
took
the
case
back
up
the
court
of
appeals.
then
it
went
back
and
briefed
that
case
and
argued
out
there
in
denver
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
judge
chandler
the
second
time
if
you
call
the
first
one
a
reversal,
and
they
told
judge
chandler
to
give
us
a
jury
trial
and
they
set
aside
his
decree,
sustaining
the
--
his
judgment,
sustaining
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir,
if
your
honor
please,
that
opinion
is
referred
to
in
the
record
and
i
can
give
the
court
all
of
those
opinions,
which
i
will
in
just
a
moment,
i
have
them
set
out
right
here
and
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
if
the
court
please,
the
opinions
of
the
circuit
court
are
printed
--
let's
see,
the
first
opinion
--
let's
see,
the
circuit
court
reversed
--
it
was
282
f.2d
and
i
have
found
--
or
282
f.2d
at
page
382,
that
was
in
1960.
now
then
--
then
after
the
court
reversed
him
and
set
aside
the
summary
judgment
and
ordered
to
give
us
a
jury
trial,
mr.
conner,
the
respondent
here,
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
which
was
by
this
court
denied.
now
then,
after
that
was
denied,
and
while
it
was
pending
on
petition
for
a
rehearing,
there
was
an
opinion
came
out
of
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
known
as
southard
versus
macdonald
and
it's
cited
at
360.
well,
i
have
the
citation
which
i
won't
look
at
--
360
p.2d
940.
in
that
case,
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
held
that
a
person
was
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
because
it
give
him
some
bland
to
a
lawyer,
mr.
macdonald
overdue
rent
for
a
lawyer
fee
and
then
four
years,
seven
months,
and
10
days
later,
there
was
a
petition
suit
filed,
and
in
that
petition
suit
there
in
oklahoma,
why
--
these
parties
who
had
made
the
deed
for
the
lawyer,
four
years
and
seven
months
before,
asked
the
court
to
cancel
the
deed
and
said
it
was
given
for
a
lawyer
fee
and
they'd
made
a
contract
for
40%,
then
when
the
case
closed
while
carrying
out
their
contract,
they
made
a
deed
for
the
lawyer,
40%
of
that,
four
years
before.
now
then,
the
supreme
court
simply
said
in
that
case,
that
that
was
not
a
jury
case
because
it's
a
suit
to
cancel
a
deed.
now,
if
the
court
will
pardon
me
for
being
personal,
i
think
about
1923
or
maybe
1925,
i
tried
a
case
as
a
lawyer
called
tillman
versus
[inaudible]
mentioned
in
this
brief
and
in
some
of
these
opinions.
and
i
didn't
know,
i
thought
it's
entitled
to
cancel
a
deed
to
a
lawyer,
the
name
of
tillman
on
account
of
the
facts,
certain
facts
therein
laid.
now,
we
tried
that
by
jury.
i
didn't
know
any
better
and
the
judge
didn't
and
the
lawyer
didn't,
so
we
just
tried
out
for
a
jury,
and
i
wanted
--
they
appealed
to
the
supreme
court,
they
complained
about
the
instructions.
the
supreme
court
said,
“well,
that
don't
make
any
difference,
it's
not
a
jury
case
anyway.”
any
suit
to
cancel
a
deed
in
oklahoma
is
an
equity
matter,
always
has
been.
that
was
announced
25
or
30
years
ago.
so,
i
mean
it's
more
than
that
actually.
there's
never
been
any
question.
now,
in
this
case,
this
court
when
they
have
made
this
application
here
for
rehearing
and
said
it
just
--
the
opinion
just
came
down
which
changed
the
law
in
oklahoma.
they
were
referring
to
this
opinion
where
the
supreme
court
said
he
wasn't
entitled
to
a
jury
to
cancel
a
deed
and
that
you've
given
somebody
four
or
five
years
before
any
length
of
time,
before
that
was
an
equity
matter.
well,
this
court,
i'm
just
guessing
is
this
of
course,
but
i'm
just
assuming
that
this
court
just
didn't
look
into
it
very
carefully,
and
said,
“well,
we
have
just
remand
this
back
out
here
to
the
circuit
court
and
ask
them
to
look
at
it.”
now,
that's
the
way
i
read
the
order.
i've
got
it
right
here,
i
mean,
it
wasn't
an
opinion,
just
an
order
from
this
court.
so
then,
we
all
went
back
to
denver
again
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
i
asked
for
the
court
in
the
declaratory
judgment
action
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
--
to
determine
how
much
lawyer
fee
we
owed
mr.
conner
if
any.
whether
it
was
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
sir,
we
did,
i'll
get
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
that's
correct.
if
your
honor
please,
i
will
call
that
--
if
you
would
pardon
me
just
to
have
a
second,
i
will
only
get
to
that
because
i
have
that
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
just
a
certain
way
in
my
mind
here
and
i
think
i
can
make
that
very
clear.
now
--
so,
when
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
got
--
back
out
and
that
was
the
reason
i
appeared
to
this
court,
directed
the
circuit
court
to
look
at
the
case
again.
so,
we
went
out
then,
we
briefed
the
cases,
the
circuit
court
argued
again.
so
then
the
circuit
court,
for
the
third
time,
held
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
a
jury,
that
we
were
entitled
to
have
out
case
tried
without
a
jury
and
that
case
is
found
in
295
f.2d
at
page
534.
now,
then
if
the
court
please,
that
gives
you
--
and
then
when
the
--
when
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
we
were
not
entitled
in
this
case
to
a
jury
trial,
then
we
filed,
mr.
simler
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court
and
this
court
granted
and
that's
what
we
argue
today.
so
this
is
the
second
time
the
case
has
been
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
states,
and
the
third
time
it
has
been
out
in
denver,
and
as
i
say,
it's
not
yet
been
tried.
now,
factually,
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
if
i
may
the
facts
in
this
case
and
i'll
support
them
for
the
record.
i'm
just
going
to
talk
about
the
facts
as
of
course
contained
in
the
record.
now
then,
if
the
court
please;
on
the
13th
day,
which
is
the
13th
day
of
july
1952,
mrs.
fletcher
died,
that
was
mr.
simler's
sister
and
he
was
the
only
heir
at
law.
he
lives
in
north
little
rock.
on
the
18th
day,
she
made
a
will
in
which
she
in
effect
disinherited
him.
she
only
gave
him
a
dollar.
and
so
after
she
made
this
will,
then
on
the
--
she
willed
the
bulk
of
her
property
to
the
sisters
of
st.
francis
which
operates
st.
anthony's
hospital
which
incidentally
is
the
largest
hospital
in
oklahoma
city
and
yoke,
i
guess.
well,
the
sisters
of
st.
francis
is
a
catholic
organization
and
it
is
a
corporation,
a
foreign
corporation
organized
under
the
laws
of
some
other
state.
now,
at
that
time,
under
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
and
the
laws
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
a
foreign
corporation,
in
fact,
no
corporation
could
hold
land
outside
of
the
city
or
town
which
was
not
necessary
for
it
--
to
hold
in
order
to
carryout
the
purposes
of
which
it
was
organized.
so
consequently,
a
hospital
couldn't
own
a
farm.
now
then,
these
--
this
will
gave
the
sister
of
st.
francis
and
others
some
15
or
maybe
now,
different
amounts
of
money
and
mrs.
fletcher,
when
she
died,
she
had
--
we'll
just
say,
$85,000
or
$90,000,
maybe
$100,000
in
bonds
and
money
and
then
she
had
real
estate
in
oklahoma
city
which
of
course
she
could
will
under
the
constitutional
provisions
of
the
sister
of
st.
francis.
but
she
couldn't
will
the
farmlands,
anything
outside
of
the
city
or
town,
then
[inaudible]
and
just
--
and
different
other
things
that
she
had.
well,
everybody
of
course
could
take
all
that,
but
now,
then
on
the
--
on
the
13th
--
no,
the
18th
day
of
july
1952,
mr.
simler
went
to
mr.
conner's
office
and
mr.
conner
met
him,
they
went
up
to
his
office.
and
mr.
sim
--
mr.
conner
drew
up
a
statement,
it's
in
the
record
here,
at
page,
as
i
remember
23
--
wait
just
a
second,
i'm
sure
it's
23
--
23,
24
and
25,
i
believe.
yes,
on
the
record,
if
your
honor
please,
at
23,
24,
and
25.
now,
we'll
take
a
little
time
to
read
this
for
the
reason
i
think
this
very
important
in
determining
whether
we
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
this
case.
i'm
reading
from
page
23.
now,
this
is
a
letter
which
mr.
conner,
the
lawyer,
drew
up
on
july
the
18th,
1952,
at
the
time
mr.
simler
employed
him.
if
you'll
notice
there,
without
me
reading
it
in
detail,
this
confirms
our
employment
of
yourself
in
law
firm
to
represent
us
in
a
matter
of
birdie
fletcher
deceased
now
pending,
and
i'll
skip
along.
now,
we
agreed
to
pay
all
of
the
witness
fees,
court
costs,
furnish
all
bonds,
purchased
copy
of
the
record,
from
all
and
so
forth,
advanced
to
pay
all
the
necessary
bills
and
so
forth.
we
understand
this
will
run
about
a
$1000.
we
also
agree
this
is
the
important
point,
to
pay
you
and
your
firm
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
for
the
services
rendered
and
to
be
rendered,
in
this
case,
in
the
county
court
and
if
necessary,
in
the
district
court,
and
if
necessary
in
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
which
fee
maybe
set
by
the
county
court
or
any
other
court
if
the
matter
is
successful
either
by
a
trial
or
judgment
or
a
compromise.
if
the
matter
is
not
won,
a
compromise
is
set
and
you're
not
to
charge
us
fee.
now,
that
is
the
first
letter.
now,
my
contention
if
your
honor
please
is
before
this
court,
that
was
full
and
complete
contract,
you
could
make
one
any
fuller
or
any
better.
they
said
i'll
pay
you
a
reasonable
fee.
now,
as
far
as
--
if
the
court
please,
if
he
gets
anything
more
than
what's
contained
in
that
letter,
he's
getting
something
--
he's
getting
something
he's
not
entitled
to.
we
want
to
pay
him
a
reasonable
fee.
it
wouldn't
be
the
amount
of
a
dime
for
a
new
house,
have
to
desire
to.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
that's
right.
so
i
was
just
saying
that
this
letter
here
--
the
reason
i'm
saying
that,
if
the
your
honor
please,
is
simply
this.
that
this
first
letter
here,
i
say
is
complete
and
the
rest
of
it,
if
you
--
if
it
--
it
would
take
away
a
jury
trial,
it
would
be
a
surplus,
and
there
wouldn't
be
of
any
benefit
anyway.
so
under
this
letter
we're
clearly
entitled
a
jury
trial.
that's
the
reason
i
mentioned
that
because
it
says
that
he's
entitled
to
a
reasonable
fee,
that
we're
not
--
couldn't
agree
on
a
reasonable
fee,
why
then
--
we'd
left
the
court
decide
it.
so
that
letter
is
full
and
complete,
so
there
is
no
reason
for
mr.
conner
to
make
any
other
contract
with
mr.
simpler
because
he
has
one
that
will
protect
him,
just
full
and
complete
as
it
can
be.
now
then
if
your
honor
please,
on
the
25th
day
of
september
1952,
we
allege
and
this
is
before
the
court
in
the
record.
it's
in
my
--
it's
in
my
reply
and
i
believe
also
in
the
complaint.
i
won't
call
for
your
attention
because
it's
really
long
and
takes
too
long,
but
anyway,
i
will
just
state
generally
what's
in
there,
it
say
in
the
record,
the
court
can
reserve
its
--
your
[inaudible].
in
the
reply,
we
set
out
that
mr.
conner
called
mr.
simler
to
come
down
to
his
office.
mr.
simler
was
there
in
oklahoma
city
visiting
his
daughter
or
somebody
and
said
he
want
to
write
him
up
a
will
or
did
write
him
up
one,
did
[inaudible]
anybody
with
him,
when
he
came
down
there.
now,
we
allege
in
here
that
mr.
simler
was
then
75
years
old,
i
think
that's
about
right,
he's
about
86
now.
now,
if
the
court
please,
he
went
down
there
without
anybody
else
for
that
reason.
he's
going
to
write
up
a
will.
when
he
got
down
there,
mr.
conner,
tried
to
get
him
to
sign
this
letter
of
september
the
25th
which
appears
on
page
24
of
the
record.
now,
we
allege
that
mr.
simler
wouldn't
sign
it.
they
argued
and
quarreled
and
fussed
and
finally
mr.
conner
took
mr.
simler
to
lunch
and
bought
him
some
beer
and
some
food
and
went
back
to
the
office.
and
again,
they
quarreled
and
fussed
and
he
had
us
come
in
and
finally
he
told
him
if
you
don't
sign,
he's
going
to
ruin
you
in
different
things
of
that
kind.
so
mr.
simler
thereby
himself,
at
that
age,
had
an
eighth
grade
education,
didn't
know
anything
about
law
or
lawyer
fees.
and
mr.
conner
prepared
this
letter
and
then
up
here
where
it
says
september
the
25th,
you
see
the
word
25th,
and
that
was
blank.
that
shows
up
in
the
record.
we've
got
a
full
--
completely
blank,
and
mr.
conner
wrote
in
there,
somebody
did
with
a
pen,
the
25,
which
indicates
to
me
and
we
thought
indicated
that
--
that
that
needn't
be
a
jury
matter
if
they
had
it
drawn
up
before
he
ever
got
down
there,
they
had
to,
because
it
had
september
and
then
blank
of
it.
now,
mr.
simler,
under
those
conditions,
signed
that.
now
he
alleged
that
he
was
imposed
on
by
his
lawyer,
that
his
lawyer
practiced
actual
fraud
on
him
and
constructive
fraud.
if
the
court
please,
i
want
try
to
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
it's
in
the
--
it's
in
the
response
to
the
answer
in
cross
complaint.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
the
response,
if
your
honor
please,
i
could
show
you
at
the
beginning
on
the
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
here.
it's
rather
lengthy
and
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
i'll
just
going
to
say
--
just
give
me
just
a
second
--
no
--
reply
to
counterclaims
of
defendant,
page
41,
beginning
right
there.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
we
filed
a
complaint,
if
your
honor
please,
claiming
that
we
owed
him
a
reasonable
fee
if
we
hadn't
already
paid
him
a
fee.
we
simply
paid
him
$24,000.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
he
replied
instead
of
the
counterclaim
and
asked
for
hype
of
everything.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
filed
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
we
called
it
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
sure,
yes
sir,
on
reply,
the
counterclaim
of
the
defendant.
now
that,
if
your
honor
please,
we
set
out
that
he
was
guilty
of
both
acts
of
fraud.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
40
--
41
is
where
it
starts.
now
then,
if
your
honor
please,
it's
--
we
just
lock
on
page
44
there,
we
say
court
invokes
the
[inaudible]
just
what
i've
got
here
stating
to
you.
and
when
he
arrived
[inaudible],
they
take
him
to
lunch
and
plaintiff
voted
--
picked
him
--
bought
him
some
beer
and
lunch
and
things
like
that.
and
then
that's
in
paragraph
8
on
page
44
and
then
at
the
time
they
said,
“let's
settle”,
and
told
the
plaintiff,
that
if
he
would
sign
the
letter
and
they
would
win
for
him
everything
to
his
estate
from
the
will,
and
that
the
plaintiff
here
then
argued
with
the
said
attorney
and
told
him
he
is
not
--
he
was
willing
for
them
to
have
reasonable
fees,
provide
the
letter
of
july
18th,
but
said
attorney's
name,
leslie
o.
connor,
contends
they
were
harassed,
harangued
and
argued
with
the
plaintiff
and
coerced
him
and
told
him
that
it
was
to
his
best
interest
to
sign
and
said,
“the
second
letter
of
the
25th
of
september.”
now,
in
the
next
paragraph,
they
allege
his
age
and
they
continue
to
harass
him
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir,
when
it
filed
the
complaint
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
then
when
i
filed
this
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
no
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
how
much
will
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
that's
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
that's
about
--
well,
if
the
court
please,
could
i
say
one
other
word
on
that
jury
a
bit.
on
the
reply
--
in
my
reply,
i
demand
the
jury
then
and
then
on
the
response
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
i
demand
it
--
well
now,
judge
wa
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
sir;
second,
on
the
reply
and
third,
on
the
response
for
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
three
different
times.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
the
first
judge
who
is
now
deceased,
judge
wallace,
he
granted
us
a
jury
trial,
but
he
never
did
get
to
try
the
case.
he
transferred
the
case
during
his
lifetime
over
to
judge
chandler.
then
the
first
time
it
came
up
before
judge
chandler,
i
would
say
it
was
on
the
type
of
a
pretrial
proceedings,
in
other
words,
we
all
went
up
there
and
so
--
he
--
i
said,
“well,
we're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
and
he
wouldn't
give
us
one.”
so
he
just
set
it
down
for
trial
for
about
10
days.
he
also
said
he's
going
to
try
that
case
without
a
jury,
that
he
could
influence
the
jury
either
way,
said,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
he
understood
what
lawyer
fees
were.
so
he
just
overruled
me
on
that.
well,
then
i
went
to
denver
and
filed
of
a
suit
for
mandamus
or
mandamus
against
judge
chandler.
now,
that's
set
out
in
the
record
here.
and
in
that
case,
the
circuit
court
held
i
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
and
ordered
him
to
give
me
one.
so
then
it
went
back
before
judge
chandler
and
he
said,
“well,
i
won't
do
anything
but
sustain
a
summary
judgment,
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.”
so,
be
in
a
kind
of
trial
to
it,
so
they
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
it
had.
it
said,
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
--
that
they
direct
him
to
vacate
for
denying
a
jury
trial,
but
it
would
not
anywise
affect
his
--
if
he
want
to
rule
on
a
summary
judgment
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
--
and
he
could
do
that
if
it
he
justified
it
or
something
like
that.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
any
way,
he
wasn't
--
he
wasn't
violating
the
orders
of
the
court
in
sustaining
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
so,
then
he
sustained
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
it's
whether
we're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
but
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
just
simply
because
the
fact
that
this
is
in
a
nature
of
a
debt.
if
it's
anything
we
owe
him
money.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
that's
governed
by
the
seventh
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
they
claim
it's
governed
by
a
state
law
and
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
that's
what
the
claim
there
in
the
trial
of
that
matter
and
that's
what
the
circuit
court
held,
that's
the
reason
we're
here
now.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
the
brief,
i
said
that's
what
they
claimed
then
if
your
honor
please.
but
now
in
their
brief,
i
believe,
i
marked
it
here
so
i
could
call
your
honor's
attention
that
i
think
now,
that
the
--
that
they
admit
that
we
should
apply
a
federal
law
instead
of
state
law
because
they
say
in
their
brief
on
page
20,
so
far
as
respondent
is
aware,
this
is
matter
that
never
gets
squared
or
laid
at
rest
by
this
court
and
it
never
has
been.
there
was
one
case
where
the
court
said
that
they'd
leave
it
to
some
other
case,
but
it
never
been
ruled
on
direct.
in
respondent's
view,
the
better
recent
decision
of
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
supports
the
notion
that
federal
rather
than
state
law
should
control
this
characterization
and
then
citing
cases
--
we
both
cite
the
same
case.
we
conclude
for
right
to
a
jury,
our
court
trial
and
the
federal
court
has
been
and
should
continue
to
be
solely
one
of
federal
practice.
now,
on
--
also
on
the
side
of
this
view,
there
is
a
very
important
fact
that
--
that
of
course
it
create
a
lot
of
different
proceedings.
we'd
to
have
a
jury
fit
the
state
and
have
a
different
--
the
federal
court
said
operate
in
different
ways
in
determining
whether
so
that
is
the
first
question
to
be
decided,
whether
federal
law
applies,
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
whether
the
state
law
applies
in
the
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
we
agree
on
that,
but
if
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir,
now
if
the
court
please,
of
course,
i
didn't
know
when
they
filed
this,
that
there
would
be
such
agreement.
even
if
we
did
agree,
we
then
still
be,
if
the
court
see,
whether
either
one
of
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
this
brief
here
is
the
first
time
that
i
know
of,
if
the
court
please,
to
see
if
they
had
agreed
to
that,
that
opinion
of
southard
versus
macdonald
upon
which
the
circuit
court
based
its
opinion
wouldn't
have
been
worth
anything
in
the
federal
court
because
that
was
a
state
court
decision.
and
that
--
that's
what
the
opinion
that
i'm
trying
to
get
reversed
here
is
based
upon
a
state
court
decision,
not
upon
a
federal
court.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
they
just
say,
if
the
court
please,
in
that
case,
that
this
southard
versus
macdonald,
a
case
that
i've
just
told
you
about,
it
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
while
this
is
up
here
on
rehearing.
there,
the
circuit
court
just
simply
said,
under
that
opinion,
the
way
they
have
to
--
the
way
they
construed
it,
we're
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
and
just
send
it
back
down
there
and
then
try
it
without
a
jury.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
if
the
court
please,
that
was
the
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
if
the
court
please,
may
i
say
this
to
the
court,
if
that
was
the
thing
the
circuit
court,
i'm
sure
i've
thought
that
if
you
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
if
your
honor
please,
you
dissented
and
justice
--
chief
judge
warren,
judge
black
and
you
said
that
it
should
be
tried
on
the
seventh
amendment
and
--
so
you
three
judges
did
--
but
the
circuit
court,
i
tried
to
argue
that
with
them
but
they
--
they
kind
of
felt
--
like
they
wouldn't
sent
it
out
there
if
you
didn't
feel
like
that,
that
oklahoma
case,
you
know,
it
should
control
and
that's
what
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
they
agree
with
me
now,
but
not
then.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
want
to
say
this
to
the
court.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
i
don't
know,
they
don't
have
to
tell
what,
but
anyway,
if
the
court
please,
i
want
to
say
this
to
this
court
and
i
deeply
appreciate
it
if
i
can
make
myself
clear
on
this
point.
in
19
--
in
46
p.2d,
haunstein
versus
mccalister
at
page
552,
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
but
to
me
it
is
a
very
important
case
here,
because
in
that
case
it's
exactly
like
this
case.
now,
they
--
nobody
could
argue
and
i
don't
think
anybody
would
argue
in
this
court
and
in
any
other
court
that
we're
not
entitled
a
jury
trial
unless
the
second
letter
of
the
25th
day
of
september
which
was
two
months
and
nine
days
after
the
first
one
and
while
the
relationship
of
attorney
and
client
existed,
unless
that
is
binding
on
us.
now,
may
i
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
this
haunstein
versus
mccalister
case
is
exactly
inborn
from
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
and
it
says
this,
and
i
won't
--
i
might
make
a
little
error
here
in
quoting
this
but
very
little.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
in
the
case
where
an
attorney
makes
any
contract
agreement
with
his
client
after
the
relationship
of
attorney
and
client
exist,
that
there
is
a
legal
presumption
that
its
fraudulent,
going
to
make
it
[inaudible]
it's
legally
presumed
to
be
fraudulent,
that's
the
oklahoma
law.
and
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
attorney
to
show
that
it
is
fair,
just,
and
equitable,
this
is
the
supreme
court
speaking
and
even
then,
now
this
is
a
part
i
would
deeply,
like
to
deeply
impress
on
court
because
this
answers
the
case,
dispose
of
it,
and
even
then,
he
is
not
entitled
a
more
than
reasonable
compensation
regardless
of
the
contract
price.
now,
that's
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
speaking
not
me,
regardless
of
contract
price.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
no
sir.
i'm
not
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
for
a
simple
reason,
if
your
honor
please,
to
show
that
that
second
letter
was
void.
that's
the
reason
i
did
that.
not
on
the
question
of
a
jury
trial
or
a
non-jury
trial.
but
if
you
didn't
have
the
second
letter
in
there,
there
couldn't
be
any
question
in
the
word.
and
i
don't
think
it
could
anyway,
because
we
alleged
fraud
and
the
courts
held
that
is
a
jury
question.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
goes
about
the
nature
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
by
the
nature
--
no
sir,
this
court
passed
on
that
squarely
by
the
nature
of
the
action,
the
kind
of
a
law
--
lawsuit
it
is,
the
nature
of
the
action.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
now,
we
brought
the
--
this
--
and
then
this
court
has
said,
now
you
--
i'm
sure
all
the
members
of
the
court
remember
the
case
of
beacon
theatres
versus
westover
judged
out
in
los
angeles
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
do
you
remember
that
case?
well
now,
that
case,
if
the
court
please,
i've
cited
that
in
here
and
that
case,
they
ordered
him
to
give
a
jury
trial.
now,
there
are
many
others
which
i
can
cite
and
i
have
to
say
there's
many
others
there.
but
now,
here's
a
case
that
i
want
to
call
to
attention
of
justice
black
there,
the
result
of
the
opinion
written
by
this
court,
its
dairy
queen
versus
howard
and
others
judge
and
that
was
decided
in
april
1962
and
it's
found
in
82
supreme
court
at
page
894,
and
i've
cited
that
in
my
brief,
and
in
that
case,
this
court
used
this
language
and
i
would
like
very
much,
if
i
might,
to
read
a
very
short
part
from
that.
now,
i
don't
know
about
the
supreme
court
of
united
states,
but
in
oklahoma
if
your
honor
please,
the
syllabus
in
a
case
that
is
made
by
the
constitution
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
the
law
of
the
case.
so,
i'm
just
going
to
read
here
briefly
from
this
dairy
queen,
petitioner,
versus
honorable
howard
j.
wood,
judge.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir,
just
the
syllabus,
i'm
reading
the
syllabus
4
now.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
but
i
know
this
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
i
can,
if
the
court
please,
if
i
just
have
--
i've
got
it
marked
just
a
minute,
i'll
go
over
here,
this
subparagraph.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
i
believe
it
would
too,
of
that
reason,
we
just
get
--
i
haven't
read
that
syllabus
out
of
the
court
because
our
constitution
makes
that
law
of
the
case.
now
--
“at
the
outset,
we
may
dispose
of
one
of
the
grounds
upon
which
the
trial
court
acted
in
striking
the
demand
for
the
trial
by
jury.”
i'm
reading
on
page
896
and
paragraph
1,
“that
based
upon
the
view
that
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
may
be
lost
as
to
legal
issues
where
those
issues
are
characterized
as
'incidental'
to
equitable
issues,
for
our
previous
decision
make
it
plain
that
no
such
rule
may
be
applied
in
the
federal
courts”,
citing
scott
versus
neely,
decided
in
1891.
“this
court
held
that
a
court
of
equity
could
not
even
take
jurisdiction
of
a
suit
in
which
a
claim
properly
cognizable
only
at
law
is
united
in
the
same
pleadings
with
a
claim
for
equitable
relief.”
now,
then
the
court
said
that
--
i'll
just
read
it
on
down
here.
now,
just
one
second,
i
want
to
find
that
part,
if
the
court
please,
at
the
--
that
for
just
a
second,
where
the
court
said,
“we
were
not
only
entitled”,
this
court
said
--
they
were
not
only
entitled
to
have
the
jury
determine
whether
it
was
a
breach
of
the
contract,
but
they
were
entitled
to
have
the
jury
determined
just
what
the
contract
was.
now,
that's
what
we're
saying
here.
now
then,
if
the
court
please,
if
you
take
the
second
letter
of
the
25th
day
of
september
out
of
this
case,
you
just
have
one
that
entitles
us
a
reasonable
lawyer
fee.
now
then,
the
very
fact
--
the
evidence
before
this
court
today
without
a
witness
being
sworn
the
very
fact
that
they're
here
contesting
a
jury
trial
and
saying
they
want
the
letter
of
the
25th
day
of
september
1952
to
stand
as
a
criteria
in
this
case,
that
very
fact
shows
if
the
your
honor
please,
that
they
think,
the
opponent
--
the
respondent
thinks
that
that
second
letter
was
to
his
benefit
or
he
wouldn't
be
paid
his
due
because
the
first
letter
gives
him
a
reasonable
lawyer
fee.
so
why
would
he
need
the
second
letter
if
all
he
wants
is
a
reasonable
lawyer
fee?
there's
no
reason
for
whatever
except
that
it
gives
him
a
terrific
advantage
over
this
old
man.
now,
in
this
case,
the
--
the
respondent
--
now
in
this
case,
this
is
for
a
breach
of
a
contract
and
an
infringement
on
one
of
these
rights,
in
order
to
operate
this
dairy
queens
and
it
was
for
the
county,
it
was
for
an
injunction,
trademark
infringement,
and
breach
of
the
contract.
and
the
court
said
--
here's
the
necessary
prerequisite
--
i'm
reading
on
page
990.
“the
necessary
prerequisite
to
the
right
to
maintain
a
suit
for
an
equitable
accounting,
like
all
other
equitable
remedies,
is,
as
we
pointed
out
in
beacon
theatres,
the
absence
of
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
consequently,
in
order
to
maintain
such
a
suit
on
a
cause
of
action
cognizable
at
law,
as
this
one
is,
the
plaintiff
must
be
able
to
show
that
the
action
between
the
parties
are
such
a
complicated
nature
that
only
a
court
of
equity
can
satisfactorily
unravel
them.
in
view
of
the
powers
given
to
federal
court,
i'll
just
skip
on
down
here
to
what
--
“a
jury,
under
proper
instructions
from
the
court
could
readily
determine
the
recovery
if
any,
to
be
had
here,
whether
the
theory
finally
settled
upon
is
that
of
a
breach
of
contract,
that
of
a
trademark
infringement,
or
any
combination
of
the
two.
the
legal
remedy
cannot
be
characterized
as
inadequate
merely
because
the
measure
of
damages
may
necessitate
a
look
into
petitioner's
business
records.”
now
then,
if
the
court
please,
in
this
opinion,
i
don't
have
that
part
marked,
i
thought
of
it
though,
but
i
don't
see
it
right
quick
and
i
don't
take
up
too
much
time
just
looking
around
there
and
try
to
find
the
portion
of
that
opinion,
but
that
opinion
says
this,
i
know,
it's
says
that
the
court
--
the
first
litigant
is
entitled
to
have
the
jury
pass
upon,
not
only
whether
there
was
a
breach
of
the
contract
but
just
what
the
contract
was.
now,
in
this
case
here,
if
the
court
please,
the
--
we're
entitled
to
have
jury
we
think
to
decide
whether
or
not
this
contract
which
mister
--
it's
not
really
a
contract,
i
don't
think
you
can
call
that
anything.
the
reason
that
i
don't
think
it
has
any
legal
name
is
because
mr.
connor
never
did
sign
it.
but
when
he
took
the
employment
on
the
13th
--
on
the
8th
--
yes,
the
18th
day
of
july
1952
and
became
mr.
simler's
lawyer,
mr.
simler
had
the
right
to
rely
upon
him
in
every
detail,
and
to
have
great
confidence
in
it.
now,
that
he
couldn't
make
any
other
contract
except
for
a
reasonable
fee.
and
then
there's
another
thing
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention,
a
racehorse
can
just
run
so
fast
and
they
can't
run
any
faster,
and
a
lawyer
can
try
a
case
just
so
hard
and
he
can't
try
it
any
harder.
but
when
he
makes
a
contract,
did
he
represent
somebody,
he
makes
one
impliedly
that
he
will
do
the
very
best
that
he
can
for
his
client.
so
what
consideration
could
mr.
connor
give
to
mr.
simler.
and
mr.
simler
said,
“well,
you're
already
my
lawyer,
you're
doing
the
best
as
you,
aren't
you?
he
said,
“yes.”
well,
what's
the
use
of
--
what
consideration
can
you
give
me
for
making
another
contract,
there
couldn't
be
any,
because
he
don't
have
anything
except
the
services
and
he's
already
obligated
to
give
him
to
the
best
of
his
ability
and
to
his
best
to
his
extent.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
he
would,
if
the
court
please,
you
know
i
haven't
had
of
those
but
i
do
think
that
--
that
lawyers,
i'm
of
course
--
i
mentioned
i
practice
all
--
kind
of
practice
all
good
a
while.
now,
then
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
he
had
to
pay
anymore,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
that
was
on
the
orders
of
the
court.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes.
i
was
--
i
did
that
if
the
court
please,
because
the
court
ordered
me
to.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
i
thought,
if
the
court
please,
if
you
will
pardon
me
saying
this,
i
thought
that's
all
to
be
to
it
and
think
it
take
over
it.
i
--
they
just
put
a
jury
out
then
that
mr.
conner
testified
what
all
he
did
and
other
lawyers
testified
what
they
thought
was
reasonable
and
then
that's
what
i
want
in
the
testimony
we
wished
to
and
what
our
kind
of
thought
is
reasonable,
but
a
jury
go
out,
judge
say,
“you've
heard
his
testimony,
go
out
and
decide
what's
a
reasonable
fee.”
now,
that's
what
i
thought.
now,
if
the
court
please,
would
you
pardon
me
to
just
finish,
i
want
to
make
a
statement
to
you
now.
oh,
i
mean,
me
and
not
you,
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
that.
you
see,
this
letter
was
without
consideration.
now,
an
agreement
to
do
that
which
a
person
is
already
bound
to
do
is
no
consideration
at
all.
now,
mr.
conner
was
bound
under
the
letter
of
the
18th
of
july
to
represent
mr.
simler,
everybody
admits
that.
now,
then
therefore,
he
was
already
bound
to
an
agreement
to
do
something
which
are
already
legally
obligated
to
do
is
no
consideration
and
i
have
two
cases
on
that.
one
of
them,
if
you
will
pardon
me
for
being
personal
again,
was
one,
i
was
a
trial
judge,
a
district
judge
down
ardmore,
oklahoma,
i
ruled
that
away
and
the
supreme
court
affirmed
it,
i
have
cited
it
in
my
brief
there
not
because
i
rule
them,
just
because
it
happened
to
fit
in
the
case
for
somebody
who
tried
to
enforce
a
contract
that
they
had
made
to
do
something
which
they
were
already
obligated
to
do.
already
--
now,
mr.
connor
is
already
obligated
to
represent
him.
now,
he
has
no
consideration
for
this
second
letter.
so
he
said,
“what
does
the
second
letter
have?”
it
doesn't
have
anything.
actually,
of
course
the
jury
is
entitled
to
determine
and
that's
what
judge
wallace
ruled,
what
the
circuit
court
ruled
twice
to
this
--
until
southard
versus
macdonald
came
up.
but
anyway,
if
the
court
please,
in
that
case,
the
jury
is
entitled
to
decide.
i
feel
positive
under
the
holdings
of
this
court
and
all
of
the
united
states.
i
have
cited
cases
on
matters
in
the
nature
of
lawyers'
contracts,
but
there
--
a
lot
of
them
insurance
cases.
but
out
here
in
california,
the
legislature
finds
the
law
that
said
that
if
a
lawyer,
you
know,
quit
the
case,
had
been
trying
along
this
with
--
while
then,
the
judge
could
fix
the
lawyer
fee.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
said
that's
unconstitutional.
it
said
the
lawyer
is
not
entitled
to
anymore
preference
than
anybody
else.
if
he
has
any
fees
coming,
he
has
a
suit
just
like
anybody
else,
and
they
held
that
unconstitutional.
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
a
few
minutes
to
close,
i
don't
know
how
much
i've
used
up,
but
i
will
--
if
it's
alright
with
the
court,
i
just
want
them
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
he
was
her
adversary.
mr.
bailey,
it
won't
change
the
truth.
mr.
ogden,
we're
bound
--
we're
not
bound
in
the
adversary
proceeding.
the
court
if
you
want
him
as
a
witness,
surely
you
--
if
you
want
him
as
a
witness
here,
you
want
to
bound
by
him,
not
all
of
the
judge,
the
court
just
part
of
it.
somebody
sues
you
and
you
have
their
testimony
you
don't
want
all
of
it
in
other
case
just
the
part
that's
relevant
to
the
execution
of
a
letter.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
may
i
say
to
the
court
what
other
witnesses
do
you
have?
and
i've
mentioned
one
there,
“alright,
what
about
it?
let's
--
let
--
we
will
let
that
in
and
if
you
will
get
the
deposition
up
here
and
only
that
will
go
in
with
reference
to
the
letter
of
september
25.
any
evidence
in
their
first
letter
that
may
be
used
then
you
got
it
in
the
record
as
any
other
evidence
and
you
got
it
in
the
record
and
any
other
evidence
cannot
be
considered.”
what
are
you
going
to
prove
on
something
more
in
court
and
let's
see
what
it
would
be?
mr.
ogden:
well,
i
have
getting
up
here
and
talk
to
him.
the
court:
i
thought
you
came
here
for
pretrial
and
then
it
goes
on.
but
it's
clear
all
the
depositions,
all
the
affidavits
before
the
court
and
although
the
colloquy
isn't
as
clear
as
it
might
be
it's
also
clear
that
one
of
the
evident
--
other
evidence
that
could
be
produced.
and
i
make
that
argument
in
support
of
the
motion
granted
to
sustain
the
summary
judgment.
and
in
the
pleadings
their
only
conclusions
pled,
they're
not
our
ultimate
facts.
there
are
no
facts
alleged
as
to
fraud
of
any
appreciable
nature.
there's
only
one
other
factual
situation
i
would
want
to
mention
that
mr.
ogden
yesterday
did
mention
that
mr.
conner
had
mr.
simler
up
there
for
the
purpose
of
signing
a
will
in
september
1952
when
this
latter
agreement
presented
into
by
mr.
simler's
deposition
that
is
lodged
in
the
clerk's
office
on
page
30.
that
will
was
entered
into
in
september
1953
not
september
1952.
now,
in
conclusion,
if
i
can
reach
after
briefly
it's
the
respondent's
position:
one,
that
in
a
federal
diversity
action
at
summary
judgment
is
a
perfectly
proper
method
of
procedure
even
though
the
countervailing
practice
doesn't
prevail
in
the
foreign
state.
two,
that
under
summary
judgment
action
it
makes
no
deference
whether
the
case
is
triable
to
a
jury
or
not
to
a
jury;
three,
that
the
court
acted
properly
in
granting
the
summary
judgment.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
if
your
honor
please
may
i
just
state
this,
i
really
wish
i
had
time
to
make
--
might
have
to
[inaudible]
i
just
don't
feel
like
to
justify
with
the
short
time
i
have
left
to
tell
the
court
the
--
here,
you
asked
about
the
litigation.
well,
all
there
was
to
it,
mrs.
fletcher
died
and
she
gave
different
people
different
amounts
of
money
and
her
brother
a
dollar.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
upheld
that
will.
the
county
court
upheld.
the
suit
the
county
court,
i
mean
the
petition
to
probate
the
will
was
disposed
off
on
october
2nd,
1952
about
seven
days
after
this
letter
was
signed.
of
course
when
the
letter
was
signed,
nobody
knew
what
the
county
court
would
hold.
that's
the
first
trial
that
was
ever
held.
then
they
appealed
the
district
court
before
judge
mills,
the
district
judge
and
he
upheld
the
will.
then
they
appealed
to
supreme
court
and
the
supreme
court
upheld
the
will
of
oklahoma.
so,
then
everything
except
this
farm
went
to
the
people
as
a
will
to,
mr.
simler
got
nothing
with
that
which
was
substantial,
i
would
say
more
than
a
$100,000
in
cash.
now,
then
mr.
grigsby
who
had
a
28%
contract
with
mr.
conner,
said,
“i
will
get
28%
of
your
fee
in
writing.”
he
conceived
the
idea
and
filed
this
suit
in
a
federal
court
saying
this
corporation
couldn't
take
because
it
was
a
corporation
and
this
farm
was
necessary
for
its
operation.
now,
the
judge,
in
oklahoma
city,
judge
wallis
sustained
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
then
mr.
grigsby
for
mr.
simler
appealed
and
went
to
denver
and
argued
the
case
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
210
f.2d
at
page
99
that
this
con
--
this
corporation
is
utterly
forbidden
to
take
this
property
because
the
constitution
of
oklahoma
won't
let
it
take
it.
so,
then
you
have
160
acres
over
here
with
unwilled
property.
well,
of
course
where
they
said
in
that
opinion
that
property
belongs
to
mr.
simler
because
he
is
the
next
--
he's
the
only
heir.
so,
that's
the
way
that
came
about.
now,
if
the
court
please,
that
case
was
certiorari
--
certiorari
was
denied
in
that
case.
now,
in
this
case
here,
if
the
court
please,
i
want
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
fact
that
suppose
they
instead
of
arguing
this
matter
that
we
would
be
arguing,
are
trying
the
case
and
i'd
called
mr.
simler
and
say,
“now,
mr.
simler
how
old
are
you?”
he
said,
“have
you
ever
been
in
court?”
“no,
never
been
in
court.”
do
you
know
anything
about
lawyer's
fees?
“no
sir.”
then
i
want
you
to
tell
the
court
and
jury
what
a
reasonable
fee
is.
they
say,
“well,
we
object
that
if
the
court
please
he
is
not
competent
to
tell
what
a
reasonable
fee
is.
the
court
sustained.
now,
the
next
thing
if
the
court
please,
if
the
court
will
read
the
haunstein
case
which
contrary
and
i
must
engage
with
counsel
has
never
been
overruled
by
any
court
at
any
time
anywhere.
i
have
the
haunstein
case
here
and
as
i
quoted
yesterday
from
that
this
contract,
this
second
letter,
it's
not
even
a
contract,
is
absolutely
utterly,
presumptively
fraudulent,
that's
what
that
said.
that
was
the
same
kind
of
a
case
between
a
lawyer
to
client
in
oklahoma.
so
since
that
was
presumptively
fraudulent,
then
the
court
said
even
the
burden
is
on
the
lawyer
then
to
prove
that
that
second
letter
was
fair,
just
and
reasonable
and
even
then,
yes,
the
very
wording
of
the
supreme
court,
he
is
not
entitled
to
more
than
a
reasonable
fee
regardless
of
the
contract
price.
so
it
wouldn't
make
a
difference.
see
if
the
court
please,
there
is
a
great
distinction
when
a
lawyer
--
a
client
comes
in
my
office
i
can
make
any
kind
of
contract
with
him,
i
want
to
do,
but
after
he
becomes
my
client,
the
law
forbids
that
i
make
any
contract
with
him
except
one
that
is
fair
and
reasonable.
i
can't
change
it
up
because
i
have
too
much
advantage
of
him.
he
wouldn't
come
to
me
unless
he
had
faith
in
me.
now,
if
the
court
please
this
common
law
matters,
i
will
call
at
your
attention
and
may
i
say
it
before
i
forget,
i
have
the
briefs
here
from
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
in
the
southard
versus
macdonald
case
and
i
have
told
the
court
on
what
they
contend
there
just
a
suit
to
cancel
the
deed
had
nothing
to
with
the
case
at
bar.
there's
no
deed
and
that
contract
in
southard
versus
macdonald
was
made
at
the
inception
of
the
--
they
made
a
contract,
it
says
it
will
give
you
40%.
then
when
they
got
through
the
case,
the
lawyer
said,
“give
me
a
deed,
you
said
you'd
give
me
40%,
you
said
alright.”
that's
contract
beginning
of
it.
they
made
him
a
deed
then
four
years,
seven
months
and
10
days
later,
those
people
sought
to
cancel
that
deed
that
they
gave
their
lawyer
four
years
before
a
fellow
lawyer.
and
so
it
has
no
connection
in
this
case.
now,
if
the
court
please,
this
common
law
case
that
he
referred
to
in
his
brief
i
want
to
read
that
to
you.
that
was
in
1693,
it's
only
eight
from
10
lines.
it'll
take
just
a
minute.
it
says,
i
can't
hardly
read
because
that
old
pen,
penny
here
but
i
got
it
anyway.
the
plaintiff
being
a
counselor
at
law
brought
a
bill
for
fees
due
to
him
from
the
defendant
being
a
solicitor
and
was
to
account
with
him
at
the
end
of
every
term.
the
defendant
demurred.
this
court
allowed
demurer
some
kind
of
words
i
can't
understand,
demurrer
affirmed
and
the
bill
dismissed,
that's
the
common
law
actually
that
he
referred
to.
in
1693,
98
years
before
the
constitution
was
adopted.
the
next
one
he
refers
too,
i
also
have
it.
i'd
like
to
read
it
to
you,
just
a
line
from
it.
we
do
not
find
any
difference
in
the
middle
ages
both
a
like
that
sue
for
their
fees
but
it
was
laid
down.
in
1629,
1630
that
a
barrister
unlike
an
attorney
could
not
sue
for
his
fees
but
in
this
case,
this
is
an
attorney
contract
so
of
course
that
wouldn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it
as
i
view
it.
now,
if
the
court
please,
i
really
think
that
i
should
in
fairness
to
mr.
simler
and
i
just
didn't
have
time
see
these
parties
took
additional
time
to
file
a
brief,
30
days.
then
when
i
got
their
brief
and
then
of
course
i'm
just
a
fair,
ordinary
lawyer
and
--
around
in
a
different
place
but
this
happened
to
be
pretty
busy
time
of
the
year
for
me
and
consequently
i
didn't
have
time
to
get
up
a
reply
brief.
i
thought
i
should
but
i
did
make
some
notes
which
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
now.
now,
if
the
court
please,
colorado,
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
said
in
a
case
here
very
similar
to
this,
all
of
these
that
i'm
going
to
call
your
attention
are
cases
where
the
lawyer
made
a
contract
with
his
client
after
the
relationship
begin.
now,
in
rough
versus
cool,
362
pacific
second,
396,
the
supreme
court
of
colorado
used
this
language.
now,
could
i
just
get
that
all
here?
i
hate
getting
heard
because
when
i
do
it
kind
of
bothers
me
and
i'm
not
much
have
the
court.
here's
what
the
supreme
court
said,
“once
the
confidential
relationship
the
attorney
and
client
exists
the
law
governing
contracts
entered
into
them
is
very
different,
entered
in
to
about
him
is
very
different.”
the
test
applied
to
such
contracts
when
the
attorney
seeks
to
enforce
the
same
is
well
stated.
7cgs
attorney
and
client,
section
204;
when
--
where
after
a
relationship
had
--
this
is
cgs,
i'm
reading
from,
wallis
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
but
that
court
didn't
see
this,
where
after
a
relationship
has
been
established
the
attorney
and
client
entered
into
an
agreement
in
reference
to
the
attorney's
compensation,
the
burdens
of
whom
the
attorney
to
prove
that
the
agreement
was
fairly
and
[inaudible]
was
supported
by
an
adequate
consideration
that
he
gave
a
client
full
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
his
legal
rights
when
he
entered
into
the
agreement
and
that
service
to
be
performed
were
reasonably
worth
the
amount
stated
in
the
agreement.
and
then
concluding
it
says,
upon
demand
and
action
for
the
recovery
specific
real
of
personal
property
with
or
without
them
just
or
for
a
money
claim
to
do
on
a
contact
of
damages
to
breach
the
contract
must
be
tried
by
a
jury
unless
the
jury
is
waived,
that's
colorado
speaking.
now,
if
the
court
please,
as
i
told
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
california
held
in
a
case
that
where
they
passed
the
law
and
california
said
the
lawyer,
if
he
withdraws,
the
judge
would
fix
fee
and
they
have
this
unconstitutional,
they
violated
the
constitution.
now,
then
if
the
court
please,
citing
cgs
again
50cgs
77874
where
there
is
a
dispute
over
terms
of
an
agreement
as
to
the
fee
to
be
paid,
also
where
it
is
provided
a
statute
that
an
acts
for
damages
is
claimed
if
successful
may
recover
reasonable
fee.
the
amount
of
such
fee
must
be
determined
by
a
jury.
now,
if
the
court
please
i
just
won't
read
from
these
because
i
haven't
got
the
time.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
sure,
they
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
if
the
court
please
now
i
know
that
when
i
get
through
here
i
feel
like
because
i
have
overlooked
something
but
i
will
call
the
court's
attention
to
this,
i
made
a
notation
here
--
of
it.
i
stated
yesterday
and
i
guess
it
sounds
that
he
could
testify,
i'm
certain
it
didn't
mean
it
that
way
that
i
try
the
case
to
the
district
judge
and
i
held
certain
thing
that
are
cited
there
in
the
brief.
so
the
agreement
to
do
that
which
were
--
i
didn't
mean
it
that
way
but
it
did
sound
it,
but
here's
another
case
from
another
court,
an
agreement
to
do
that
which
one
is
already
obligated
to
do
is
not
sufficient
consideration
to
support
a
contract
and
it
promise
to
pay
additional
compensation
for
performance
by
promisee
of
contract,
that
promisee
is
already
under
obligation
to
perform
is
without
consideration.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
if
the
court
please,
may
i
just
say
this
that
for
the
second
letter
as
i
construe
it
there
couldn't
have
been
any
consideration
because
mr.
conner
was
already
bound
to
represent
him
to
the
best
of
his
ability.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
for
a
--
for
a
reasonable
compensation.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
but
surely
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
if
the
court
please,
i
want
to
say
though,
i
have
a
case
here
that
is
very
similar
to
it
and
it
said
that
that
modification,
any
modification
of
an
existing
contract,
i've
got
the
case
cited
right
here,
any
modification
of
it
must
be
supported
by
a
consideration
just
like
any
other
contract.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
if
the
court
please
i
just
say
this
to
the
court
that
i
have
cited
that
case
there
on
that
point.
now,
then
so
i
feel
like
that
under
the
haunstein
case
in
oklahoma
and
the
many
other
cases
and
the
general
authority
throughout
the
united
states
is
that
the
lawyer,
he
just
can't
make
any
contract
with
him
for
anything
except
the
reasonable
fee
and
he's
already
have
that
so
therefore
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir,
he
can
make
a
contract
for
fees
for
up
to
50%
under
oklahoma
law,
but
to
make
a
contract
with
his
client
that
must
be
done
before
the
relationship
of
attorney
and
client
exists.
now,
that's
what
the
haunstein
case
said.
that
was
the
very
facts
in
that
case.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
they
would
have
sued
us
for
a
reasonable
fee.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir,
they
would
have.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
that's
correct,
if
your
honor
please.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
if
your
honor.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
if
your
honor
please,
the
court
--
this
court
has
said
that
declaratory
judgment
act
doesn't
deprive
a
person
of
their
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
i
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
i
cite
it
in
the
brief
and
i
didn't
say
because
if
the
court
please.
i
felt
like
it
but
i've
cited
the
case
is
here
from
the
supreme
court.
now,
if
you
honor
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
there
is,
if
your
honor
please.
may
i
say
this
to
the
court,
if
they
bring
a
suit
for
specific
personal
or
real
property,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
which,
with
--
that
we're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
of
course
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
they're
seek
--
yes.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
under
the
federal
and
state
both,
i
want
to
read
it
since
the
court
said
that
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
since
the
court
asked
me
that.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
i
--
if
the
court
please,
i
can
find
it
but
it
just
take
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
if
they
sue
for
specific
property?
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
if
your
honor
please
i'd
like
to
read
this.
this
is
title
12,
article
556
of
the
oklahoma
statute
annotated
and
i'll
give
my
reason
for
reading
just
a
moment.
issue
of
law
must
be
tried
by
the
court
unless
referred.
issues
of
fact
arising
in
action
for
the
recovery
of
money
or
of
specific
real
of
personal
property
shall
be
tried
by
a
jury
unless
a
jury
is
waived
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
b.
ogden
that
statute,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
that's
my
opinion,
if
the
court
please,
it's
always
been
and
still
is
and
i
certainly
don't
change
it
now.
but
let
me
just
say
this
to
the
court
as
i
view
it,
they
are
seeking
here
half
of
the
farm
and
they're
seeking
that
half
of
the
farm
because
of
the
fact
and
you
asked
about
the
value
of
it,
i
don't
know
any
more
than
he
does
but
when
this
suit
was
filed
shortly
thereafter
the
court
made
an
order
and
tied
up
all
the
money.
and
it's
in
the
hands
of
the
court
and
the
circuit
court
releases
some
to
mrs.
simler
at
one
time,
but
regardless
of
that
if
the
court
please
they
are
seeking
here
money,
they
want
half
for
the
money
that's
accumulated
all
through,
they
want
half
for
the
land.
now,
then
whether
or
not
i'm
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
that
case,
i
think
i
am
but
under
this
opinion
right
here
from
this
court
in
the
dairy
queen
case
and
i
marked
it
but
i
couldn't
find
it
because
i'm
kind
of
in
hurry
there
but
the
dairy
queen
case
here
is
what
the
--
this
court
said,
i'm
reading
from
a
divided
opinion.
petitioner's
primary
defense
to
charge
a
breach
of
contract
that
is
the
contract
that
modified
the
subsequent
oral
brief
presents
purely
a
legal
question
having
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
either
innovation
as
a
district
judge
suggests
or
reformation
as
he
suggest
to
the
respondent
here.
such
a
defense
goes
to
question
on
just
what
under
the
law
the
contract
between
the
respondent
and
petitioner
is
and
in
an
action
to
collect
the
debt
for
breach
of
a
contract
between
these
parties,
the
petitioner
has
a
right
to
have
a
jury
determine
not
only
whether
the
contract
has
been
breached
and
the
extent
of
the
damages
if
any,
but
also
just
what
the
contract
is.
now,
if
the
court
please
if
this
contract
was
entered
into
without
consideration
that
would
be
a
question
of
fact
for
the
jury
to
pass
upon.
now,
then
if
the
court
please,
if
he
was
overreached
and
it
became
a
question
of
fraud
that
the
jury
found
he
committed
fraud
in
securing
this
second
letter.
that
is
a
question
for
a
jury
to
pass
upon
and
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
united
states
and
all
of
the
federal
courts
so
far
as
i've
been
able
to
find
have
always
held
that
that
is
a
question
for
the
jury
to
pass
upon.
so
as
justice
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
sir
surely.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
that's
exactly
right,
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
obtained.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
no,
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
that's
right.
now,
if
your
honor
please
may
i
say
this?
this
court
said
and
i
can't
just
tell
you
right
now
because
it
would
just
take
too
long
to
look
it
up,
but
this
court
has
said
that
we
have
a
right
when
we
bring
a
suit,
we
bring
the
suit
and
they
can't
come
in
and
file
some
--
any
kind
of
appeal.
they
won't
do
any
claim
of
equitable
relief
and
deprive
us
of
the
right
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
a
jury
trial.
they
just
don't
have
a
right
to
do
that.
this
court
said
that
and
so
in
several
cases
the
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir.
now,
then
if
your
honor
please,
if
we
just
had
my
petition,
our
complaint
here
before
the
court
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
whether
we
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
then,
because
it
just
asked
for
--
confirm
what
a
reasonable
fee
is
in
this
case
then
when
they
filed
their
answer
and
claimed
half
for
the
land
and
half
for
the
money
impounded
in
the
hands
of
the
court,
they're
suing
for
money.
then
we
reply
to
that
and
we
say
that
there
was
no
consideration
for
that
and
then
we
also
say
if
the
court
please,
it
was
obtained
by
fraud
in
both
factual
and
constructive
and
as
therefore
going
for
that
reason.
now,
if
the
court
please
in
closing,
i
guess
i
don't
really
know
i've
got
to
kind
of
add
some
matters
noted
here
but
it's
kind
of
hard
to
--
you
know
the
--
to
get
all
these
matter
before
the
court
when
you
kind
of
break
the
general
line
of
your
presentation
but
i
want
to
say
this
in
closing,
if
your
honor
please,
this
is
not
a
suit
for
a
specific
performance
of
a
contract.
mr.
simler
--
mr.
conner
in
his
response
or
answer
in
the
cross
complaint,
he
says
this
second
letter
is
not
a
contract
at
all.
he
says
that's
not
a
contract.
he
said
that
was
only
entered
into
for
the
purpose
of
determining
or
clarifying
what
a
reasonable
fee
was.
that's
in
his
answer.
i
can
show
you
the
book
page.
so
he
says
that
wasn't
the
contract;
that
was
just
for
the
letter
for
the
purpose.
now,
just
to
make
it
kind
of
foolish,
maybe
bring
out
--
suppose
he
meet
mr.
simler
out
in
the
hall
and
said,
“mr.
simler
what
do
you
figure
a
reasonable
fee
is?”
we
got
--
he
say,
“well,
i
guess
50%
will
be
reasonable.”
well
that
wouldn't
make
a
contract.
now,
that's
all
the
letter
is,
just
not
--
nothing
has
ever
been
signed
by
mr.
conner,
the
second
letter
or
the
first
either.
so,
just
because
they
put
in
a
letter
that
mr.
simler
thought
50%
was
reasonable.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
assume
that
it
is
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
that's
right.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
what
would
mr.
conner
sue?
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes,
complaint
claimed
if
your
honor
please,
that
on
the
13th
day
of
july
and
they're
into
the
contract
for
a
reasonable
fee.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
i
didn't
quite
finish
that
yet
and
then
he
would
allege
further
that
on
the
25th,
that's
what
he
puts
in
his
answer
for
the
purpose
of
clarifying
that
contract
that
mr.
simler
agreed
that
50%
was
a
reasonable
fee.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
he'd
sue
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
no
sir.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
i
thought
it
would
sue
for
one
half
of
the
property
and
the
money
up
there
in
the
hands
of
the
court
that
would
be
what
i'd
sue
for
if
i
was
presenting
the
matter
to
--
mr.
john
b.
ogden
well,
he
didn't
do
that
though
in
this
case
for.
if
he
sued,
you
can
look
at
his
answer
from
the
cross
complaint
that
he
sued
for
one
half
of
the
property
and
one
half
of
to
proceeds
that
accumulated
during
that
period
of
time.
that's
what
he
sued
for
in
this
case.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
yes
sir,
that's
what
he
said
up
in
his
answer
and
we
replied
to
it.
but
--
and
we
replied
to
it
and
set
forth
the
reasons
that
there
was
not
--
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
it.
we
want
him
to
have
a
reasonable
fee
but
on
the
jury
to
tell
us
what
a
reasonable
fee
was?
now
then,
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
have
any
way
of
knowing
too
well
but
now
this
court
said
and
i
just
mentioned
to
you
just
a
moment
ago
that
a
declaratory
judgment
act
preserves
the
right
to
a
trial
by
juries
and
then
the
court
further
says
there's
question
of
fraudulent
misrepresentation
was
decisive
of
issues
both
and
insures
action
for
judgment
on
declaring
live
policies
void
because
of
fraudulent
misrepresentation.
and
seeking
recession,
now
i'd
like
the
court
to
note
this
and
cancellation
of
policies
and
in
beneficiary
counterclaim
for
face
amount
of
policies
and
beneficiary
could
not
be
deprived
of
his
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
such
issues
by
suspending
action
on
counterclaim
and
trying
complaint
for
declaratory
judgment
without
a
jury.
and
then
of
course
the
beacon
case
referred
to
next
and
i
have
a
great
number
of
federal
cases
but
there's
one
if
your
honor
please,
which
is
a
lawyer
fee
case,
a
federal
case.
and
it's
found
in
300
f.2d
on
page
number
1,
and
i
have
it
right
here
but
i
won't
have
the
time
to
read
it.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
is
it
up?
if
your
honor
please,
would
it
be
--
i
don't
know
because
i
know,
at
this
late
they
had
asked
to
file
a
reply
brief.
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
the
fact
that
i
didn't
have
an
opportunity
to
inform
that,
i
didn't
feel
like
it.
i
filed
an
application
and
written
application
for
it.
mr.
john
b.
ogden
i'd
do
it
as
soon
as
i
get
home,
if
your
honor
please.
