now,
when

[inaudible]
governed

justice

black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know,
but
the
other
side
seems
to
agree
with
you
now,
aren't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
now
--
are
you
arguing
now
that
it
should
be
governed
by
the
law
of
oklahoma?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
cite
that
oklahoma
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
how
do
you
think
the
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
is
good,
by
the
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
that
come
later.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
brought
--
the
nature
of
the
action
that
is
brought?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
ford.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
basic
dispute
between
you
and
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
something
to
do
with
the
case.
isn't
the
basic
dispute
whether
you
hold
them
--
they
owe
you
money,
expressed
on
--
via
express
by
5
contracts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
basic
dispute
between
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
common
law
action
of
this
type,
who
tries
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
(voice
overlap)
but
assuming
that
the
summary
judgment
was
wrong
from
the
evidence,
there
was
a
dispute
in
fact
between
them,
wasn't
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
dispute
set
up
in
the
complaint?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
owed
who?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
as
i
recall
it
under
the
common
law
that
was
at
least
considered
a
pretty
good
common
law
action,
wasn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it
about
the
most
basic,
most
premised
common
law
action
to
bring
up
a
dispute
about
how
much
somebody
owed
somebody
else?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
no
question
here
that
you
had
to
have
any
accounting,
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
an
accounting,
was
that
the
basic
from
which
you
are
claiming
that
it
was
not
triable
by
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
position
that
the
counterclaim
deprived
the
man
of
a
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
who
has
filed
a
complaint
and
was
entitled
a
right
to
trial
by
a
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
better
not,
provided
they
two,
they
have
--
one
of
them
equity
and
try
it
first
whether
he's
been
--
contracts
would
be
rescinded
if
they
decide
it
shouldn't
and
you
got
to
sue
on
that
contract
then
you
go
back
to
common
law
and
get
a
jury,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
any
case
if
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
completing
it
up
like
this.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there's
--
do
you
mean
that
the
reasonable
agreement
waived
the
right,
constitutional
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
in
the
federal
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
the
whole
case
rescinded
somewhat
on
how
men
viewed
the
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
under
the
seventh
amendment,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that's
consistent
with
beacon
and
dairy
queen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
judge
friendly's
opinion
is
consistent
with
beacon
and
dairy
queen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
indicate
how
much
it's
worth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
claim
--
there's
difference
between
what's
a
reasonable
fee
and
what's
presented
to
that
trial?
justice
hugo
l.
black
half
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
aside
from
this
litigation
over
the
fee,
what
other
litigation
you
have
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
united
states
court
of
appeals?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
lawyer
can't
make
a
contract
for
a
fee
for
percentage
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
believe
you'd
do
better
if
you
stick
to
federal
law
as
justice
harlan
suggested.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
you
have
a
case
where
they
--
that
if
you
hadn't
filed
a
declaratory
judgment,
what
would
they
have
sued
you
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
they
have
sued
you
for
on
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
would've
had
sued
against
you
on
a
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
chose
however
to
go
in
and
ask
for
declaratory
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
happened
in
the
beacon
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
now
have
this
question
whether
when
you
come
in
for
declaratory
judgment
decide
the
same
issue,
you
thereby
lose
the
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
the
constitutional
right
to
trial
by
a
jury
they
would've
been
--
had
it
--
if
they
had
any
sued
it
on
the
old
way
just
direct?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
first
time
you
said
it
though.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall.
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
said
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
who
said
that?
what
state
--
what
federal
decision
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
you
can.
i
doubt
if
you
can.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
is
a
contract
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
assume
it
is
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
get
the
argument
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
he
sue
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
what
was
his
complaint
claimed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
but
no,
no
that's
not
that
contracted
you're
suing
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
he
sue
you
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
sue
you,
is
it
as
a
suit
for
a
specific
performance
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
when
a
man
sues
another
on
a
contract
to
make
him
pay
what
he
agreed
to
pay?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
â€“
[inaudible]
suit
for
the
dead?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
he
said
up
in
his
answer?
