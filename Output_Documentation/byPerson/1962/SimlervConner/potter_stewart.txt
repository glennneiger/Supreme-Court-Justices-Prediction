but
the

justice

stewart
under

by
remanding
it
for
a

and
then
by
remanding

twice
that
is
--
it
is
adhered
to
the
position
that
summary
judgment
was
inappropriate
and
improper
in
this
case.
justice

some
$90,000
had
been

of
mr.

50%?
justice
potter
stewart
they
would've
sued
you
in
fact
or
might
well
have
sued
you
for
specific
performance
to
convey
an
undivided
half
interest
in
that
property,
in
that
160-acre
farm.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
do
you
contend
there's
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
that
kind
of
a
consideration?
justice

stewart
to
convey
an
undivided

real
property?
justice

stewart
you're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial?
justice

stewart
under
what
law?
justice

stewart
i
doubt
if
you
could
find
it.
justice

half
interest
in
that
160-acre
farm

or
whatever
year
it
was?
justice

stewart
that's
the
oklahoma

isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
then
--now
you
told
us
throughout
your
argument
that
federal
law
should
apply.
justice
potter
stewart
the
whole
question
here
is
whether
you
do
have
a
right
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
a
jury
trial.
if
you
do
obviously
nobody
can
deprive
you
of
it.
justice
