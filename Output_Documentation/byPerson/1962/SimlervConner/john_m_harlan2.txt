justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
so
far
in
your
action.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
justice
john
m.
harlan
didn't
you
--
didn't
you
have
a
contract
with
mr.
conner
for
a
contingent
fee?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
you
claim
that
the
contingent
fee
contract
was
induced
by
a
fraud
or
was
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
void
as
a
matter
of
law?
justice
john
m.
harlan
alright.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understood,
perhaps
i'm
wrong.
i
understood
that
you
were
arguing
this
case
on
the
premise
that
federal
law
controlled
both
with
respect
to
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
with
respect
to
the
characterization
is
equitable
or
non-equitable.
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
cause
of
action,
federal
law
applies
throughout,
that's
your
premise?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
the
southard
and
the
case
for
these
purposes
decide
the
point?
justice
john
m.
harlan
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
to
be
more
concrete.
if
under
state
law
this
action
would
be
characterized
as
an
equitable
cause
of
action,
but
under
federal
law
and
i'm
just
assuming
just
for
a
moment,
under
federal
law
it
would
be
characterized
as
an
action
of
law,
the
federal
law
would
govern
and
a
jury
trial
would
follow,
isn't
that
your
premise?
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
other
words,
there
is
no
basis
--
a
suggestion
where
--
suggest
in
your
brief
that
we
should
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted
because
the
jury
question
in
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
it's
squarely,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
summary
judgment
was
granted
on
the
first
door
around
the
state
court
and
court
of
appeals
reversed
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
the
fact
is
that
the
case
since
their
first
conversion
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
tried
on
the
merits.
justice
john
m.
harlan
wasn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
beg
your
pardon.
yes,
i
see.
yes,
you're
quite
right.
justice
john
m.
harlan
mr.
ford,
it
is
true,
i
take
it,
that
in
order
to
deal
with
this
matter
on
the
summary
judgment
premise
which
i
think
would
result
in
dismissal
of
the
writ
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
if
it's
correct.
justice
john
m.
harlan
we'd
have
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals'
determination
that
there
was
a
triable
issue
of
fact?
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
much
money
is
involved
in
this
in
addition
to
attorney's
fee?
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
is
an
oil
situation?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
is
about
$250,000?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
sure.
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
federal
law
governs
this
question.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
this
is
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
the
point.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
this
isn't
that
situation.
this
is
a
case
of
parties
agreeing
to
liquidate
what
is
meant
by
a
reasonable
fee
and
i
can't
understand
why
there
isn't
plenty
of
consideration
as
far
as
that's
concerned?
justice
john
m.
harlan
for
an
unliquidated
fee,
unliquidated
fee
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
people's
ideas,
what
is
reasonable
are
very
wide
sometimes
particularly
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
when
it
comes
to
lawyer's
fees
in
this
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
contracts
simply
liquidated
what
that
amount
was.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
a
liquidation
of
an
unliquidated
amount
is
consideration
on
both
sides
in
fixing
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
liquidating
what
is
theretofore
uncertain.

john
m.
