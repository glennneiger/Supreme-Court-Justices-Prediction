you
can't
read
this
from
the
opinion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let's
see
now,
that
the
court
was
--
i
haven't
looked
at
these
affidavits,
are
they
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
the
facts
that
mr.
ogden
pleaded,
he
told
us
yesterday
require
to
the
counterclaim,
were
those
facts
developed
in
affidavit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
they
were
not
in
the
affidavit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

second
--
second
one
is
set
aside.
justice

jr.
on
the
basis
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
tell
me,
mr.
ford,
if
summary
judgment
point
has
no
merits,
aren't
you
going
to
shift
probably
with
your
other
argument
in
light
of
our
dairy
queen
and
that
other
decision
of
ours
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
distinguish
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
there
federal
court
decisions
--
at
least,
are
there
any
in
this
court
that
an
action
to
rescind
a
written
agreement
for
ground
--
on
grounds
of
actual
cause
are
equitable
in
nature?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
certainly
state
facts;
that
the
reason
wasn't
in
my
state.
