mr.
john
p.
sandidge
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
as
we
see
this
case,
it
involves
two
propositions.
first,
whether
or
not
subsection
(p)
is
the
exclusive
remedy
given
for
the
enforcement
of
an
award,
and
second,
when
the
union
chooses
to
ignore
this
provision
and
attempt
by
strike
to
force
the
provisions
of
award
upon
the
railroad
that
the
injunctive
process
maybe
used
to
vindicate
the
act.
now
gentlemen,
i
would
like
to
say
initially
concerning
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
the
record,
at
page
136a,
you
will
find
the
exact
language
used
in
the
submission
which
was
the
language
that
was
given
in
the
complaint
by
the
agreed
employee
to
the
company
in
the
handling
on
the
property.
and
that
is
requested
--
a,
sir.
in
the
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
of
the
trial
court,
it's
quoted.
request
that
fireman
b.g.
humphries,
louisville
main
stamp
division
to
be
reinstated
to
service
with
former
seniority
unimpaired
and
paid
for
all
time
lost,
article
31.
the
finding
of
the
board
is
at
a
137a
claims
--
sustain
with
pay
for
time
lost
as
the
rule
is
construed
on
the
property.
now,
the
rule
that
is
involved
is
next
quoted
on
page
137a.
“if
the
discipline
administered
is
not
sustained,
it
will
be
cancelled
and
the
fireman
in
question
will
be
paid
for
all
time
lost
by
him
resulting
from
the
investigation
or
action
taken.”
now,
in
kentucky
under
what
we
called
the
wells
case
which
is
in
147a
and
the
findings
of
facts
in
conclusions
of
law
of
the
court,
it
has
been
consistently
that
this
rule
has
been
interpreted
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
as
back
as
for
1942.
the
whole
--
that
the
rule
means
that
the
man
is
to
be
made
whole
that
it
is
not
a
penalty
rule
and
that
outside
earnings,
earning
during
the
time
he
has
been
off
can
be
deducted
and
should
be
deducted
and
it
is
on
--
and
the
burden
is
on
him
on
to
so
prove.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir,
i
believe
it
would
though
it
is
not
binding
on
the
adjustment
board.
the
question
of
the
kentucky
law
would
be
involved
concerning
the
application
of
this
--
for
our
construction
of
this
particular
rule.
and
since
the
parties
all
involved
are
in
kentucky,
we
would
be
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
no
sir.
i
think
it
would
be
persuasive
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir,
that's
correct.
and
also
i
might
point
your
honor
to
rule
--
for
example,
on
page
220b
of
the
record.
you
will
find
an
interpretation
award
in
which
this
very
question
has
came
up
between
the
parties
and
the
deduction
of
outside
earnings
was
allowed.
and
that
was
based
there
upon
the
federal
rule
and
the
general
common
law
which
permits
this
deduction.
now,
if
your
honor
--
the
reason
i
am
mentioning
this
is
to
show
the
area
of
the
dispute.
there
is
a
legitimate
dispute
here
and
the
trial
court
so
found
in
these
findings
of
fact
that
the
railroad
had
in
good
faith
could
insist
that
these
deductions
be
made.
now,
when
it
reached
this
point,
the
next
thing
that
was
done
was
what
the
act
suggests
under
(o),
and
the
railroad
over
the
objection
of
the
unions
resubmitted
this
award
and
questioned
to
the
adjustment
board
for
an
interpretation.
you'll
find
in
the
record
that
interpretation
and
it
came
down
by
a
referee,
the
board's
deadlocked
in
each
one
of
these
instances
and
actually
their
decisions
by
a
referee.
and
in
those
particular
cases
--
in
that
particular
case
they
said
that
this
was
a
new
cause
and
therefore
could
not
be
interpreted
as
an
interpretation
under
(o).
therefore,
the
railroad
went
back
to
the
union
and
said,
“let's
submit
this
to
the
board
as
a
new
question.”
and
the
union
did
not
agree
and
the
railroad
then
did
submit
the
question.
the
union
called
a
strike
after
it
was
in
the
adjustment
board
and
as
a
result,
we
are
here
after
evidence
and
proof
concerning
the
purpose
of
the
strike.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir,
it
did.
in
the
last
--
in
the
second
submission,
it
rejected
it
the
basis
that
the
first
one
was
res
judicata
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
i
agree
with
you
your
honor.
and
i
think
it
should
have
been
decided
under
the
question
for
an
interpretation.
i
believe
that's
what
the
provision
in
the
act
is
for
and
the
board
did
not
fulfill
its
duty.
however,
there
is
nothing
that
we
can
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
no
sir.
we
could
not
bring
a
mandamus
action
because
they
did
act
but
we
feel
acted
erroneously.
now
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir,
but
there
is
a
division
between
my
adversary
and
i.
the
trial
court
found
that
both
parties
had
consistently
contended
your
honor
that
outside
earning
should
be
or
should
not
be
deducted.
proof
was
taken
on
this
particular
point
and
he
found
that
the
l
&
n.
had
consistently
maintained
it
could
be
deducted
and
that
the
brotherhoods
had
consistently
maintained
it
could
not
be
deducted.
in
previous
cases,
the
l
&
n.
had
always
asked
for
the
information
concerning
outside
earnings.
but
in
none
of
the
cases
your
honor,
were
there
any
outside
earnings,
when
the
information
was
given?
that
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
so
actually
when
you
say
there's
a
determination,
no
sir.
i
--
we
have
taken
one
consistent
position
but
we
have
never
been
at
logger
heads
where
it
has
been
an
issue
before.
is
that
a
fair
answer
your
honor,
to
your
question?
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
i
can
tell
you
about
our
property
your
honor.
i
cannot
tell
you
about
the
rest
of
the
country.
i
cannot
either
criticize
or
about
say
for
one
way
or
the
other
for
the
figures
given
mr.
heiss,
that
is
not
in
the
record
and
i'm
not
prepared
on
that
subject.
on
our
particular
property,
there
are
three
cases,
your
honor,
involved
in
enforcement
proceedings.
this
is
one
or
where
there
hasn't
been
a
compliance
with
award.
this
one
is
one.
there's
also
one
that
is
now
pending
in
the
--
where
enforcement
suit
has
been
filed
in
the
--
in
atlanta.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
birmingham,
alabama.
and
then
there
is
a
similar
case
just
exactly
to
this
one
on
outside
earnings
that
nothing
has
happened
on
it.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
your
honor,
i
would
say
very
many.
i
cannot
give
you
the
figure.
we'll
be
happy
to
supply
it.
before,
we
have
a
whole
department
that
does
nothing
but
this
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
i
can't
answer
that
question.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
and
what
bothers
me
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir,
that
are
adjusted
right
on
the
property.
when
a
grievance
is
filed,
very
few
of
them
your
honor,
in
proportion
get
to
the
adjustment
board
and
most
them
are
settled
one
way
or
another
on
the
property.
and
of
course,
i
might
say
this
on
this
attacking
of
the
chicago
river
case
on
the
basis
of
these
figures.
i
do
believe
that
you
must
take
also
in
consideration
the
fact
that
with
the
decline
in
the
railroad
industry,
there
are
more
claims
being
filed
and
either
side
can
file
these
claims
before
the
adjustment
board,
not
just
one.
therefore,
i
don't
think
that
particularly
the
figures
as
given
without
further
analysis
really
have
any
validity
concerning
the
effect
of
the
chicago
river
case.
now,
getting
to
the
jugular
vein
of
this
particular
case
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir.
and
i
don't
see
how
our
differences
would
prevent
the
adjustment
board
by
--
in
deadlock
with
the
referees
being
appointed
from
deciding
just
as
many
cases
as
it
formally
decided
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir
and
that
happens
also
in
the
adjustment
board.
the
filing
of
briefs
and
asking
for
continuances,
i'm
sure.
now,
getting
to
the
issue
in
this
case
concerning
the
main
trend
of
it
and
that
is,
is
this
remedy
that's
given
by
subsection
(p)
the
exclusive
remedy
for
the
enforcement
of
an
award.
i
say
in
all
sincerity
to
your
honors,
i
believe
it
is.
i
believe
it's
substantiated
by
the
chicago
river
case.
it's
also
substantiated
by
the
history
and
in
the
legislative
history,
and
the
decisions
of
the
other
courts
who
have
considered
this
matter.
they're
all
cited
in
our
brief.
there
have
been
five
district
courts
and
four
circuit
courts.
everyone
has
come
to
the
same
conclusion.
now,
why
do
they
come
to
this
conclusion?
simply
because
the
statutory
scheme
is
a
complete
scheme
and
it
contains
three
links
just
like
a
chain.
number
one,
if
i
had
asked
for
the
handling
on
the
property
then
if
it
cannot
be
handled
on
the
property
then
either
party
may
submit
it
to
the
adjustment
board.
and
then
after
an
adjustment
board
award
that
is
enforceable
in
the
courts
by
means
of
filing
in
the
district
court
certain
proceedings.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir,
i
think
so
because
here
congress
created
a
new
right
your
honor
and
in
order
to
have
enforcement
--
a
statutory
enforcement
proceeding
must
be
in
the
statute.
for
example,
it's
been
held
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir,
i
think
it
could
have.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
that's
correct.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
your
honor,
this
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
if
there
were
no
adjustment
board
law,
i
think
they
could
either
strike
or
file
a
suit.
now,
ever
since
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
i
think
it
takes
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
no
sir,
it
was
not.
all
that
was
reached
in
the
chicago
river
case
was
while
it
was
pending
under
the
board's
jurisdiction.
now,
an
effort
has
been
--
our
discussion
has
been
handed
here
as
to
manion
when
the
matter
had
been
handled
on
the
property
but
neither
party
had
submitted
it
to
the
adjustment
board.
i
think
the
answer
to
manion
is
that
the
railroad
certainly
to
be
entitled
to
injunctive
relief
must
exhaust
its
administrative
remedies
and
it
had
a
remedy
by
placing
the
matter
in
the
adjustment
board.
and
it
had
not
done
so
therefore
this
court
said
in
its
opinion,
its
per
curiam
opinion
that
it
was
prejudice
to
the
reinstating
of
the
injunction
once
that
matter
was
submitted
to
the
adjustment
board.
now,
again
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
whole
statutory
scheme
of
compulsory
adjustment
that
we
have
placed
in
our
supplementary
appendix,
a
letter
from
the
federal
coordinator
and
the
secretary
of
labor
at
the
time
this
matter
was
pending
to
the
--
to
franklin
roosevelt,
president
of
the
united
states
in
which
they
were
urging
the
passage
of
this
bill.
and
again
they
stated
in
this
letter
that
the
purpose
of
this
act
was
to
provide
compulsory
adjustment
of
individual
grievances.
i
think
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir,
and
i
think
that
would
be
the
difference
of
the
distinction
that
my
friend
would
make
between
arbitration
because
under
(p)
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir?
under
(p)
you
find
that
costs
cannot
be
assessed
against
the
individual
employee
but
if
the
individual
employee
prevails,
attorney's
fees
are
assessed
against
the
railroad.
now
in
washington
terminal
against
boswell,
this
was
held
to
be
the
only
remedy
that
the
railroad
could
not
itself
--
if
it
would
dissatisfied
within
an
warrant,
file
a
declaratory
judgment
suit,
that
the
enforcement
provisions
rested
and
remained
in
the
hands
of
the
employee
or
his
union
under
(p)
and
that
was
the
exclusive
remedy
that
was
had.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
i
would
agree
with
you
with
one
exception,
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir,
that's
right.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
that's
correct
sir
and
a
judgment
goes
against
the
railroad.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
well,
no
sir,
i
think
in
the
prima
facie
aspect
of
the
case
goes
to
the
facts
as
found
by
the
adjustment
board
in
its
award.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir
and
the
statute
supervise.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
i
think
that
is
correct
your
honor.
if
he
lose,
he's
precluded
and
your
honors
reference
in
the
price
case
in
page
611,
footnote
10,
is
that
they
cannot
strike
in
that
provision.
no
sir
--
now
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir.
now,
in
that
provision
your
honor
--
it
says,
“where
he
may
sue,
the
suit
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
well,
if
it
carrier
don't
not
comply
with
an
order
of
the
division
of
the
adjustment
board
within
a
time
limit
in
such
order,
the
petitioner
or
any
person
for
benefit
such
order
was
made.
they
file
in
the
district
court
of
the
united
states
for
the
district
in
which
he
resides
or
in
which
he
is
located,
the
principal
office
of
the
carrier
and
to
which
the
carrier
operates,
a
petition
setting
for
a
brief
in
the
causes
for
which
he
claims
relief
in
order
the
division
of
the
adjustment
board
in
the
premises.
such
suit
in
the
district
court
shall
proceed
in
all
aspects
as
in
other
civil
suits
except
that
on
a
trial
of
such
suit,
the
findings
and
order
of
the
adjustment
--
of
the
division
of
adjustment
board
shall
be
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
facts
therein
stated
and
except
that
the
petitioner
shall
not
be
liable
for
cost
in
district
court,
not
for
cost
in
any
subsequent
stage
of
the
proceedings
unless
they
accrue
on
his
appeal,
and
such
cost
shall
be
paid
out
in
appropriation
for
the
expenses
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
if
the
petitioner
shall
prevail,
he
shall
be
allowed
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
so,
it
imposes
a
penalty
on
the
railroad
in
case
the
railroad
is
wrong
because
it
has
to
pay
this
attorney's
fee,
has
to
pay
attorney's
fees
your
honor,
of
the
petitioner.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir
that
is
true
and
of
course
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
to
make
parties
assure
of
their
position
before
they
take
it.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
two
things
could
happen.
number
one
is
that
the
--
the
unions
could
contend
by
giving
a
six
in
six
notice
that
the
railroad
was
unilaterally
facing
a
position
on
the
contract
that
was
not
there
and
in
fact
making
a
new
contract.
therefore,
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
any
injunctive
relief
in
this
particular
instance,
if
that
were
in
fact
a
fact
that
could
be
proved
and
that
--
if
that
were
the
given
situation,
however
that's
not
the
situation
here
your
honor.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
i
think
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir.
i
think
you'd
have
somewhat
the
same
situation
again,
not
quite
the
same
but
as
you
had
in
its
--
the
leg
of
this
case
that
was
reasonable
for
you.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
alright
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
no
sir.
i
do
not
believe
they
would
have
a
right
to
strike.
i
believe
their
remedy
would
be
to
probably
bring
an
enforcement
suit.
and
at
the
enforcement
suit
procedure
is
a
substitute
right
given
for
the
right
to
strike
and
was
so
understood
by
all
of
the
parties
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
your
honor
--
no
sir.
i
cannot
answer
that
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
no
sir,
i
do
not.
and
i
think
the
reason
for
this
is
one
--
one
phase
of
this
case
your
honor
that
has
not
been
discussed,
and
that
is
the
interest
of
the
public
in
this
particular
industry.
and
that
this
industry
is
burdened
with
a
different
proposition
than
most
industries.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
no
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
no
sir.
no
sir,
i
did
not
say
that.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
no,
sir.
you
--
i
--
if
i
have
correctly
understood
your
question
your
honor,
if
as
to
some
other
industry,
you
asked
me
if
i
knew
of
any
other
law
in
any
other
industry
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
alright
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir,
time
claimed
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
by
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir.
in
other
words
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
a
tort
claim
does
not
fall
in
the
same
category
at
all
your
honor.
that
would
be
an
flea
case.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir.
i
believe
that
they
would
because
there
is
a
remedy
given
in
the
--
under
the
fela
--
to
bring
its
action
by
the
individual
employee
as
far
as
the
bringing
of
--
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
the
only
closest
thing
to
it
your
honor
is
dorsey
against
kansas
where
efforts
were
made
in
a
kansas
act
that
controlled
matters
pretty
well
to
bring
a
suit
or
to
strike
on
behalf
of
a
second
employee
who
had
a
claim
against
the
company
and
it
was
held
in
that
case
that
there
was
not
a
common
law
strike
or
right
to
strike
in
all
instances.
and
that
it
was
limited
to
determining
the
purpose
of
the
strike
and
if
the
strike
was
for
any
of
the
purpose,
it
could
be
enjoined.
again
your
honor,
going
back
to
the
particular
act
in
question
as
far
as
we
are
concerned
here.
if
a
time
claim
is
filed
which
is
contented
to
be
a
breach
of
contract,
certainly
the
procedure
before
the
adjustment
board
is
available
and
we
have
many
such
claims
at
our
file.
and
they
come
out
as
money
awards
and
are
enforceable.
very
few
of
these
cases
ever
get
to
the
enforcement
proceeding.
frankly
your
honor,
because
most
of
them
were
paid
when
they
are
against
the
company.
because
the
company
or
the
railroad
cannot
justify
the
incurring
of
additional
expense,
if
it
feels
it
does
not
have
a
case
it
can
win.
mr.
john
p.
sandidge
yes
sir,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
case
is
after
they
are
disposed
off
are
not
accordingly
paid
or
settled
out
according
to
the
recommendations
of
the
adjustment
board.
the
last
aspect
of
the
case
that
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
are
many
voluntary
rights
that
we
had,
that
have
been
limited
by
the
railway
labor
act,
the
right
--
of
course
illinois
against
howard
and
all
those
discriminatory
cases
come
into
play
here.
many
rights
to
bring
you
different
kinds
of
actions
like
declaratory
judgment
actions
have
been
eliminated
by
the
railway
labor
act.
and
so
there
is
nothing
different
or
unusual
in
this
particular
case.
now,
concerning
the
right
to
an
injunction,
we
believe
we're
entitled
to
an
injunction
under
the
theory
of
the
chicago
river
case
because
there's
no
difficulty
with
norris-la
guardia
here.
this
is
--
injunction
is
for
the
purposes
of
vindicating
the
act.
we
believe
it's
just
this
simple
that
the
only
way
the
adjustment
board
award
can
be
enforced
is
by
an
enforcement
suit
which
is
mandatory.
therefore,
an
injunctive
process
is
justified
to
vindicate
the
provisions
of
the
act.
we
believe
that
on
all
sides
of
this
question,
statutory
interpretation,
judicial
precedent,
legislative
history,
that
we
are
entitled
to
have
this
sustained.
thank
you.
