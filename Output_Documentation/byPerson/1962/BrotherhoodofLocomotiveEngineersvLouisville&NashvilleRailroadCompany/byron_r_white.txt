justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
heiss
if
the
award
is
against
the
--
if
the
board
decided
against
the
union
--
what
if
the
board
decided
against
the
union
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
nothing
--
nothing
would
prevent
you
from
striking
though,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
contend
for
the
right
but
don't
you
legally
have
the
right
to
strike?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
if
you
lose
the
case,
why
can't
you
strike
to
the
enforce
it
anyway
because
by
the
same
argument,
the
adjustment
board's
procedures
are
over,
they've
been
exhausted.
why
should
the
court
be
able
to
enjoin
your
strike
just
because
you
lost
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
did
strike,
it
was
--
it's
enjoinable?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
if
you
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
your
position
is
that
when
the
board's
procedures
are
exhausted
that
then
enjoinability
ends.
