mr.
harold
c.
heiss
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
this
cause
are
the
four
railroad
transportation
brotherhoods,
holding
collective
bargaining
contracts
on
the
louisville
nashville
railroad
which
was
plaintiff
in
the
trial
court
and
is
the
respondent
in
this
court.
the
case
involves
the
construction
and
application
on
the
railway
labor
act,
a
statute
which
this
court
in
recent
years
has
had
occasion
to
examine
on
several
occasions.
this
particular
case
involves
a
labor
dispute
on
the
respondent
railroad
which
was
submitted
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
by
the
railroad.
the
submission
resulted
in
an
award
favorable
to
the
employees
which
the
railroad
has
declined
to
make
effective.
since
the
railroad
declined
to
make
the
award
effective,
the
employees
regarded
the
dispute
as
unsettled
and
insisted
upon
the
right
to
bargain
respecting
the
dispute
by
all
lawful
methods
including
the
calling
of
a
strike.
this
was
a
minor
dispute
properly
before
the
adjustment
board
and
the
adjustment
board
processes
have
been
exhausted
and
completed
your
honor.
no
question
about
that.
no
question
at
all.
no
dispute
on
that.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
such
a
strike
is
lawful
or
whether
it
is
forbidden
by
the
railway
labor
act.
a
strike
to
settle
the
grievance
was
enjoined
by
the
district
court,
and
the
injunction
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
sixth
circuit.
we
sought
certiorari,
if
your
honors
please,
because
we
believe
that
if
the
decisions
below
stand
collective
bargaining
as
a
means
of
settling
minor
disputes
in
the
railroad
industry
will
be
destroyed.
by
collective
bargaining,
i
mean
negotiation,
conference,
and
mediation
culminating
in
extreme
cases
in
strikes.
the
alternative
to
collective
bargaining
as
i've
defined
it
is
the
procedure
which
the
decisions
below
thrust
upon
the
railroad
industry.
the
reference
of
untold
thousands
of
grievances
to
the
adjustment
board
for
decisions
and
their
ultimate
review
by
the
courts
when
the
awards
are
in
favor
of
the
employees.
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
the
threshold
of
this
case
that
there
is
more
involved
here
than
the
means
of
disposing
of
a
single
grievance
of
involving
a
few
thousand
dollars
in
pay,
there
is
involved
in
my
opinion,
the
monumental
question
of
whether
collective
bargaining
is
going
to
survive
as
a
means
of
settling
grievances
in
this
industry.
and
with
that
context,
i
should
like
to
tell
the
court
the
facts
which
are
simple,
undisputed
and
not
particularly
important.
humphries,
a
fireman,
a
locomotive
fireman
was
discharged
in
1956.
the
fireman's
crafts
sought
--
the
representative
of
the
fireman's
crafts
sought
his
reinstatement,
and
threatened
this
--
ultimately
threatened
a
strike
to
secure
the
reinstatement
whereupon
the
railroad
submitted
the
dispute
as
to
his
reinstatement
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
the
submission
involved,
one;
the
question
of
the
justification
for
discharge.
and
two;
whether
humphries
should
be
paid
for
the
time
lost.
the
submission
did
not
involve
the
major
to
be
applied
in
the
event.
the
finding
should
be
that
he
was
entitled
to
be
paid.
the
adjustment
board
in
its
award
in
favor
of
humphries
found
that
he
should
be
reinstated
and
paid
for
time
loss
as
the
rule
is
construed
on
the
property.
thereupon,
the
representatives
of
the
fireman's
craft
carried
the
award
to
the
carriers
and
asked
that
it
be
made
effective.
all
four
organizations,
all
four
petitioning
organizations
were
invited
by
the
representative
of
the
fireman's
craft
to
participate
in
these
negotiations
to
make
the
award
effective.
the
railroad
made
no
complaint
about
the
presence
of
the
four
representatives,
but
told
before
that
in
future
cases,
in
cases
of
reinstatement
after
discharge
that
all
of
them
will
be
treated
alike.
to
wit,
that
in
the
measurement
of
what
the
pay
for
time
loss
should
be,
that
outside
earnings
made
by
the
individual
employer
would
be
set
off
against
the
amount
of
earnings
that
he
would
have
accumulated
had
he
remained
in
the
employment
of
the
carrier.
it
was
the
contention
of
the
representatives
of
all
four
organizations
which
had
identical
contracts
that
under
the
particular
rule
involved
here
that
pay
for
time
loss
did
not
include
this
matter
of
off
setting
outside
pay.
admittedly,
it
was
a
penalty
rule
and
quite
different
from
the
common
law
rule
which
would
have
--
which
would
have
applied
in
the
absence
of
a
rule.
now
under
the
threat
of
a
strike,
because
of
the
railroad's
unwillingness
to
settle
this
remaining
labor
dispute,
a
second
submission
was
made
in
the
docket
of
the
first
case
by
the
railroad
to
the
board
asking
that
the
board
interpret
this
--
its
award
as
to
the
measure
of
pay
whether
outside
earnings
should
reduce
the
amount
which
humphries
would
have
to
be
paid.
the
board
held
that
the
measure
of
pay
was
not
presented
by
or
argued
in
the
first
submission.
and
that
the
board
would
not
determine
the
question
of
the
measure
of
pay
under
the
guise
of
an
interpretation.
and
hence
that
ended
the
second
submission
which
the
representatives
of
the
employees
carried
back
to
the
railroad
company.
and
as
for
the
pay
as
they
in
--
the
amount
of
pay
which
they
set
had
been
always
paid
in
accordance
with
the
scheduled
rule.
under
a
second
strike
threat,
a
third
submission
was
made
by
the
railroad
company
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
this
under
a
new
docket
number.
and
the
railroad
company
in
the
third
submission
asked
whether
it
should
be
required
to
pay
the
accumulated
pay
or
the
accumulated
pay
mitigated
by
the
amount
of
outside
earning.
the
adjustment
board
on
this
third
submission
dismissed
the
case,
holding
that
the
board
rules
prevented
a
piecemeal
submission
of
disputes
and
that
the
railroad
company,
either
that
one
of
the
board's
determination
of
that
particular
issue
should
have
presented
it
in
the
first
submissions
of
the
board.
and
that
it's
failure
to
do
so,
had
barred
the
l
&
n.
railroad
from
bringing
the
case
subsequently
to
the
attention
of
the
board.
that
was
the
board's
interpretation
of
its
rules
and
that
ends
the
third
submission.
now,
as
i
told
the
court
at
the
beginning,
the
adjustment
board
process
in
this
case
is
at
an
end.
there
is
no
opportunity
for
anyone,
petitioners
or
the
respondents
to
have
further
recourse
to
the
board.
there
is
a
labor
dispute
between
the
labor
organizations
and
the
l
&
n.
railroad
as
to
humphries'
future
treatment.
that
dispute
is
unsettled
and
we
claim
and
assert
and
contain
that
collective
bargaining
is
the
solution
to
the
problem.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
there
is
a
contention
here
which
i
was
just
about
to
touch
upon
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
that
there
is
an
enforcement
suit
available
to
us
under
section
3
(p)
of
the
labor
--
railway
labor
act.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
when
the
award
is
in
favor
of
an
employee,
the
statute
says
section
3
(p),
that
an
enforcement
suit
maybe
brought.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
this
is
that
kind
of
case.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
it
would
have
so
–
put
the
employees
on
it.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
substantially
that
is
the
case
your
honor.
we
claimed
that
the
enforcement
suit
is
not
an
exclusive
remedy
but
an
additional
remedy
to
the
collective
bargaining
process
once
the
adjustment
board
process
has
been
completed
and
the
award
is
in
favor
of
the
employee
and
we
stand
upon
that
particular
and
narrow
set
of
facts.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes.
under
washington
terminal
against
boswell
was
a
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
and
which
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
a
equally
divided
opinion.
it
was
held
by
judge
rutledge
that
the
award
of
the
adjustment
board
can
be
disregarded
by
the
carrier
and
treated
as
having
no
legal
effect.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
we
could
in
a
sense
frustrate
it
mr.
justice
goldberg
by
bringing
in
enforcement
suit.
but
there
are
several
reasons
why
a
union
or
an
employee
might
not
choose
to
bring
in
an
enforcement
suit.
for
example,
an
enforcement
suit,
in
an
enforcement
suit,
the
award
of
the
adjustment
board
has
very
little
vitality.
when
a
case
of
a
money
award
is
concerned,
the
award
is
not
final
and
binding.
and
in
any
case,
in
any
case,
no
matter
what
its
character,
it
is
only
valuable
in
the
court
as
a
prima
facie
evidence
of
the
facts
stated
therein.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
don't
think
that
we
have
a
statute
here
which
has
any
evidence
at
all
in
it
of
congress
having
attempted
to
balance
the
powers
of
the
employees
and
the
union's
in
every
respect.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
that's
fundamental.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
and
it
--
and
it's
because
of
that
lack
of
balance
that
we're
here.
we're
trying
to
even
this
thing
up
a
little
bit.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
if
the
board
had
decided
against
the
union
mr.
justice
white,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
and
we
don't
contend
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
oh,
we
don't
contend
for
the
right
to
strike
if
the
adjustment
board
rules
against
it.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
no,
we
don't
think
we
do
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
--
and
we
don't
assert
it.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
we
are
willing
under
the
decisions
that
have
been
handed
down
to
regard
the
adjustment
board
decision
as
being
final
against
us.
when
the
case
has
been
submitted
to
the
board
and
decided
by
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
we
would
not
--
we
wouldn't
strike.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
we
wouldn't
strike,
that
is
our
policy.
that
is
our
conception
of
this
matter
has
been
--
ever
since
the
1934
amendments
were
adopted.
that's
why
i
tell
you,
if
this
court
that
we
are
standing
on
this
narrow
question,
with
--
the
award
has
been
in
our
favor.
and
we
are
here
insisting
upon
the
right
either
to
go
to
the
adjustment
board
--
or
either
to
go
the
courts
or
to
pursue
the
collective
bargaining
process
alternative
remedy.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
am
unwilling
to
go
that
far
because
my
facts
don't
require
me
to
do
it.
i
have
a
favorable
award
here
and
i
intend
to
your
honor
please,
to
take
full
advantage
of
it.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
you
did.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes,
that's
what
you
said
in
price
and
we
are
perfectly
willing
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
to
stand
on
price.
but
our
case
is
different
from
price.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
this
is
a
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
here
we
have
an
award
and
i
favor
it.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
he
had
law.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
don't
want
to
undertake
unnecessary
burdens
by
taking
issue
with
the
prior
decision.
it's
like
trying
to
force
me
into
taking
issue
with
the
chicago
river
case
which
the
chief
--
in
which
the
chief
justice
wrote
the
opinion,
or
in
union
pacific
against
price.
i
don't
have
to
do
that.
i
don't
want
to
do
it.
i
stand
on
the
facts
of
this
of
this
case.
i
want
to
do
what
i
can
in
this
argument
before
the
court
to
preserve
if
i
possibly
can
the
right
of
collective
bargaining
in
this
industry
which
i'm
later
going
to
try
to
develop
as
being
at
stake
in
this
case
in
respect
to
the
solution
of
grievances.
now,
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes,
i
think
you're
right,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
the
section
which
allowed
the
submission
of
dispute
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
--
to
the
adjustment
board
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes,
there
is
that
similarity
but
i
don't
think,
i
don't
face
any
special
emphasis.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
upon
the
“may”
either
in
3
(p)
or
in
3
(i).
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
beg
your
pardon?
yes.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
well,
it's
not
a
special
emphasis.
i'm
going
to
call
attention.
it's
already
been
called
to
the
presence
of
“may”
that
leads
me
right
into
the
next
portion
of
my
argument
if
the
court
please.
as
i
understand
it,
the
railroad's
contention
here
is
based
entirely
upon
one
proposition.
namely,
that
the
presence
of
the
enforcement
procedure
is
an
intrical
part
of
the
statutory
scheme
for
the
complete
and
final
settlement
of
grievances
and
that
the
presence
of
this
remedy
excludes
any
other.
this
is
the
contention
we
must
meet.
now,
there
are
five
elements
at
least
which
support
we
believe
our
contention
that
the
enforcement
remedy
is
not
exclusive.
first,
it's
not
stated
to
be
exclusive
in
the
statute.
stated
in
another
way,
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
specifically
forbid
strikes
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
settlement
of
awards.
there's
no
specific
prohibition
against
strike.
second,
the
legislative
history
fails
completely
to
reveal
that
the
remedy
of
an
enforcement
suit
is
exclusive.
it
reveals,
we
believe
to
the
contrary
that
the
enforcement
suit
was
made
available
as
an
additional
remedy
to
the
remedy
of
collective
bargaining.
third,
when
the
1934
amendments
were
adopted,
congress
had
before
it
the
question
of
whether
to
insert
provisions
in
the
amendment
authorizing
injunction
against
strikes
when
board
awards
are
involved
in
grievance
cases
and
inserted
no
such
provision.
we
believe
that
the
court
should
not
find
a
broad
prohibition
in
the
statute
when
congress
consciously
refrained
from
inserting
such
a
prohibition,
or
the
doctrine
of
exclusiveness
is
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
section
3
second
of
the
railway
labor
act
which
permits
group,
regional
or
system
boards
to
be
established
by
voluntary
agreement
without
enforcement
provisions
being
applicable
to
such
boards.
now,
if
the
achievement
of
industrial
peace
is
to
be
accomplished
in
respective
grievance
cases
by
the
presence
of
the
enforcement
procedure,
it
is
our
position
that
the
enforcement
procedure
would
have
been
made
applicable
to
the
establishment
of
the
voluntary
regional
or
system
boards.
but
section
3
(p)
as
your
honors
will
observe
is
limited
to
enforcing
the
award
of
the
division
of
the
adjustment
board.
and
neither
in
section
3
second,
nor
in
section
3
(p),
nor
in
any
other
place
of
the
act
is
there
the
slightest
indication
that
the
enforcement
procedure
can
be
utilized
with
respect
to
an
award
rendered
by
one
of
these
voluntarily
established
boards.
and
incidentally,
there
is
no
limitation
upon
the
number
of
these
voluntary
established
boards.
they
could
have
been
established
on
every
railroad
and
in
every
region
of
the
country
and
it
virtually
have
done
away
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
court.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
think
not
your
honor,
not
--
number
one.
i
don't
want
to
have
a
head-on
collision
with
the
chicago
river
case
and
i
don't
think
i
have
to.
i
think
the
chicago
river
case
protected
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
and
didn't
go
beyond
it.
now
in
that
respect
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
the
recitations
of
the
legislative
history
and
so
forth
contained
in
the
opinion
probably
went
the
beyond
it.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
decision
necessarily
went
beyond
it
and
i
hope
it
didn't.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
well,
i
say
this.
i
want
to
call
attention
to
kansas
city
terminal
against
manion
which
was
decided
two
weeks
after
the
chicago
river
case
and
which
was
my
case
before
the
court.
chicago
river
held
that
while
disputes
were
pending
before
the
adjustment
board,
strikes
could
not
be
tolerated.
in
the
kansas
city
terminal
case
decided
two
weeks
later,
this
court
in
a
per
curiam
opinion
granted
certiorari
and
summarily
reversed
the
kansas
city
court
of
appeals
which
had
enjoined
a
strike
conducted
by
the
--
about
to
be
conducted
by
the
fireman's
organization
to
settle
some
grievances,
but
under
circumstances
where
neither
party
had
taken
the
case
to
the
adjustment
board.
now,
the
court
said
this:
the
judgment
of
the
kansas
city
court
of
appeals
must
be
vacated
in
the
light
of
our
decision
in
chicago
river
because
the
dispute
here
is
not
ending
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
the
cause
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
position
and
without
prejudice
to
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
reinstate
its
judgment
if
the
dispute
is
submitted
to
the
adjustment
board
by
either
party
within
a
reasonable
time.
now,
as
i
see
it,
there
is
a
reconciliation
to
the
end
between
the
kansas
city
terminal
case
and
the
chicago
river
case.
when
a
dispute
has
not
been
taken
by
either
party
to
the
adjustment
board
as
i
construe
the
kansas
city
terminal
opinion,
an
injunction
for
strike
could
not
lie,
otherwise
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
would
have
vacated
it
in
a
particular
instance
of
the
kansas
city
terminal
case.
and
the
only
way
as
i
read
the
kansas
city
terminal
decision
for
reinstating
the
injunction
would
be
the
taking
of
the
dispute
by
one
party
or
the
other
to
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
so,
i
don't
regard
the
decisions
of
this
court,
the
only
two
of
which
i
know
of
and
which
i
have
mentioned
as
exercising
a
compulsion
upon
either
the
railroad
company
or
the
brotherhood
or
both
to
take
these
grievances
to
the
adjustment
board.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
in
the
few
moments
remaining,
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
--
only
one
point
that
i
think
i
have
time
to
cover
and
that
is
to
emphasize
this
fact.
but
i
believe
the
effect
that
the
affirmation
of
the
decision
of
the
courts
below
i
think
would
be
chaotic
in
this
industry,
and
i
want
to
tell
you
why.
the
solution
of
the
problem
of
disposing
of
grievances,
the
founders
of
this
industry
and
the
founders
of
this
act
in
congress
believed,
in
my
opinion,
lies
in
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
not
in
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
without
the
collective
bargaining
process
and
the
threat
of
strike
being
posed,
the
national
mediation
board
will
become
a
nullity
so
far
as
an
effective
influence
in
the
disposition
of
grievances
is
concerned.
now,
we're
here
dealing
with
like
--
this
is
a
typical
instance
of
multitude
of
grievances.
there's
nothing
difference
in
humphries'
case
from
thousands
that
developed
on
the
railroads.
the
primary
method
of
disposing
of
those
grievances
has
been
bargaining,
conferences
with
a
strike
poised
in
the
back
of
and
without
the
economic
power
of
a
strike.
somewhere
along
this
line,
we
won't
get
these
grievances
disposed
off.
now,
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
we
are
at
that
point.
we
are
at
that
point
in
this
case.
the
adjustment
board
processes
are
behind
us.
we're
trying
to
enforce
award
that
is
favorable
to
us,
with
an
excellent
equitable
position
and
we
urge
upon
you
that
we
are
at
that
point
where
the
economic
power
which
was
not
attempted
to
be
obliterated.
in
the
passage
of
1934
amendments
must
be
preserved
for
us.
since
the
chicago
river
case,
let
me
in
a
few
moments
study
what
has
happened
to
the
proceedings
before
the
adjustment
board,
so
far
as
an
effective
instrument
of
industrial
peace
is
concerned.
in
1958,
457
awards
rendered
by
the
adjustment
board,
that
was
one
year
after
the
chicago
river
case
where
the
threat
of
strike
was
removed
while
cases
were
pending
before
the
board.
in
1962,
163
cases
were
decided,
considerably
less
than
half.
the
railroads
were
not
cooperating
with
this
in
the
disposition
of
grievances
before
that
board.
1962
was
the
poorest
year
productively
in
the
national
media
--
national
railroad
adjustment
board
annuals.
these
figures
are
obtainable
in
the
reports
of
the
board
in
the
mediation
board
offices.
in
1957,
the
backlog
was
approximately
2400
cases
pending
before
that
board.
in
1962,
the
backlog
had
increased
by
50%
to
3500
in
92
cases.
the
railroads
were
preparing
under
the
(inaudible)
of
the
chicago
river
case
and
the
program
which
they
initiated
in
the
courts
below
in
this
case
and
the
d&rgw
case,
to
refuse
to
settle
grievances
with
us,
to
refuse
to
dispose
of
them
before
the
adjustment
board
and
enforce
this
into
two,
and
three,
and
four
year
litigation
on
the
courts,
to
enforce
even
favorable
awards.
now
at
the
rate
of
200
cases
a
year
which
is
more
than
they
disposed
of
last
year
would
take
from
15
to
20
years
for
that
adjustment
board,
to
dispose
of
the
backlog
of
3600
cases.
and
so
far
as
my
figures
are
concerned,
the
number
of
cases
coming
to
the
board
is
progressively
increasing
year
by
year
or
at
least
its
remaining
steady.
so
we're
going
to
maintain
that
backlog.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
the
backlog
in
1937
your
honor
was
2370s
--
2376
cases,
i
said
approximately
2400
cases.
and
it
has
increased
to
3592
cases
in
1962.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
don't
think
that
the
brotherhoods
had
made
any
effort
to
get
the
law
amended
in
this
respect
but
they
have
established
committees
and
met
with
the
railroad
presidents
and
other
officials
in
an
attempt
to
inject
some
vitality
into
the
adjustment
board
proceedings
without
any
success.
this
restraint
upon
the
right
to
strike
has
turned
out
to
be
a
very
valuable
weapon
in
the
hands
of
the
railroads
to
throttle
us
in
the
disposition
of
our
grievances.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
don't
think
that
it
has
your
honor.
it
hasn't
been
called
to
my
attention
that
they
had
done
it.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
no,
i
did
not
say
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
has
not
been.
but
under
section
3
second,
it
might
be
and
if
it
did,
the
adjustment
--
the
enforcement
procedure
would
not
be
applicable.
that's
all
i
say
to
you.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
they
are
not
by
statutes.
that's
right,
that's
right.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
they
are
not
by
statute
under
section
3
second.
they
are
--
the
awards
are
neither
final
nor
binding
nor
are
they
enforceable
under
section
3
(p).
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
that's
right.
you'll
find
everything
there
is
to
find
in
section
3
second,
respecting
regional
and
system
boards.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
think
not.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i'm
not
aware
of
that
your
honor
and
i
don't
subscribe
to
it.
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
if
they
have
different
provisions
from
ours,
i'm
not
aware
of
them
but
i
certainly
don't
subscribe
to
it
with
respect
to
the
railroad
industry.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
then
i
don't
subscribe
with
the
argument
made
yesterday
in
that
respect.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
it
--
i
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
give
any
support
to
that
than
i
can
find.
if
there
was
an
agreement
to
that
effect,
that's
something
quite
different
on
the
part.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
well,
first
place,
with
your
honor's
question,
indulges
in
an
assumption
that
i
can't
go
along
with.
i'd
be
--
in
my
opinion,
the
awards
of
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board
are
not
arbitration
awards.
and
for
--
and
i
say
that
for
this
reason,
i'm
not
going
to
take
any
issue
with
chicago
river
case
that
--
where
the
words
compulsory
arbitration
was
used,
but
i
do
not
think
that
chicago
river
attempted
to
characterize
the
proceedings
after
the
rendition
an
award.
now
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes.
now,
[inaudible]
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes.
i
would
say
that's
true.
but
i
want
to
make
certain
that
the
court
does
not
feel
that
i
am
acquiescing
in
any
suggestion
that
after
the
board
has
finished
--
the
adjustment
board
had
--
has
finished
its
function
that
the
product
is
a
compulsory
arbitration
award
because
it
doesn't
have
that
characteristic.
if
you
take
an
award
of
the
adjustment
board
in
the
court,
it
is
not
res
judicata
as
a
--
an
arbitration
award
normally
is.
the
courts
can
inquire
into
whether
there
is
a
cause
of
action
in
an
arbitration
award,
there
is
no
such
inhibition
on
the
courts
with
respect
to
adjustment
board
awards.
i
don't
think
that
the
analogy
to
compulsory
arbitration
if
your
honor's
please,
extends
to
the
award
of
adjustment
board.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
the
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
the
--
there
is
a
dispute.
there
is
a
dispute
over
the
application
of
the
award.
there
is
a
dispute
over
the
measure
of
play
--
of
pay.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
what
is
--
what
it
--
is
any
time
lost?
in
quotation,
“what
is
any
time
lost?”
there
is
a
dispute
over
that.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
think
it's
speculated
as
to
what
happened
there.
this
was
an
award
that
humphries
be
restored
and
paid
for
any
time
lost.
the
adjustment
board
finished
its
work.
we
say
there
is
a
dispute.
now,
whether
it's
a
dispute
over
the
meaning
of
the
award
or
whether
it's
just
a
plain
ordinary
labor
dispute,
i
don't
think
it's
important.
we
were
entitled
--
we
think
we're
entitled
to
strike
to
settle
the
dispute.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes,
that's
what
gives
rise
to
the
dispute,
but
nobody
can
go
back
to
the
board.
the
board's
work
is
finished.
there
is
no
other
tribunal
established
under
the
act
to
which
to
go.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
yes,
yes,
that
is
in
this
particular
case.
as
i
said
at
the
beginning,
there
is
more
involved
here
than
the
--
just
these
little
cases
to
many
thousands
of
dollars
maybe
due
humphries.
there
is
the
principle
involved
here
as
to
whether
we
make
--
engage
in
collective
bargaining
to
dispose
of
this
dispute.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
think,
our
men
on
the
property
will
see
that
the
railroad
is
just
refusing
to
pay
a
money
award
because
they
don't
give
any
--
they
say
that
the
raising
of
the
question
as
to
how
much
was
due
as
an
afterthought
on
the
part
of
the
railroad
and
if
it
--
if
they
had
thought
of
it
in
the
first
place,
if
it
had
played
any
part
in
the
disposition
of
this
case,
they
would've
raised
the
question
in
their
submission
to
the
adjustment
board.
so
after
the
adjustment
board
came
out
with
an
award
in
favor
of
humphries,
the
railroad,
as
an
afterthought,
raises
the
question
as
to
how
much
is
due
and
we
--
there
was
much
made
of
the
trial
court
--
in
the
trial
court
of
the
lack
of
good
faith
of
the
carrier
in
treating
our
people
and
raising
this
question
after
the
case
had
gone
to
the
board.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
the
--
there's
a
split.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
no,
there's
a
split
down
the
middle
as
to
how
these
awards
came
down.
this
is
not
unusual
neither
is
it
an
exclusive
method
of
rendering
award.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
well,
there
are
people
contented
that
they're
--
that
all
of
the
past
practice
on
the
property
was
that
outside
earnings
were
not
to
be
calculated.
that
was
the
unanimous
view
of
the
--
of
all
of
the
four
organizations.
the
railroad
took
precisely
the
opposite
view.
and
of
course
that
dispute
was
not
resolved
by
any
binding.
there's
just
the
plain,
ordinary,
knocked
down,
dragged
out
labor
disputes.
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
i
don't
think
--
mr.
harold
c.
heiss
mr.
justice
goldberg,
this
legislative
history
is
copied
in
full,
every
word
of
it
that
we
are
able
to
assemble
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
but
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
i
think
that
the
legislative
history
so
far
as
this
particular
subject
that
we're
talking
about
is
far
from
plain
we
were
engaging
in
compulsory
arbitration.
as
i
say,
it
ought
to
run
head-on
into
the
chicago
river
case,
we
are
separating
this
case
from
the
chicago
river
case.
now
the
--
this
matter
of
strike
injunctions
with
respect
to
adjustment
board
awards
was
taking
up
separately
and
distinctly,
and
commissioner
eastman
and
his
attorney,
mr.
carmel
indulged
in
conversation
with
the
members
of
congress
about
it.
and
commissioner
eastman
says,
this
is
at
page
46
of
our
appendix,
“now
the
only
question
i
am
in
doubt
about
is
whether
or
not
there
should
be
an
injunction
under
this
act
to
prevent
a
strike.”
“no,
i
am
not
clear
about
that.”
mr.
wovertine(ph),
“do
you
think
there
should
be
such
a
provision
to
the
bill?”
commission
eastman,
“i
would
see
it
carried
out
without
that
because
i
do
not
believe
you
are
going
to
have
that
question
arise.”
“do
you
consider
better
policy
to
leave
it
out?”
commission
eastman,
“well,
no
particular
question
has
been
raised
about
this
matter
of
enforcement.”
then
mr.
karmel
says
at
the
bottom
of
page
47,
“it
seems
to
be
at
least
arguable
that
a
strike
by
the
enjoined
of
the
provisions
of
this
law
that
to
say,
a
strike
is
called
because
of
failure
to
comply
with
an
adverse
decision
of
the
judgment
of
the
board
in
favor
of
the
carriers
against
the
employees.”
this
question
of
strike
injunctions
was
considered
and
congress
washed
its
hands
of
it.
and
our
preposition
to
this
court
is
that
we
think
if
congress
refrained
from
writing
in
a
strike
injunction
provision
that
the
court
should
refrain
from
writing
one
in
congress
place.
thank
you.
