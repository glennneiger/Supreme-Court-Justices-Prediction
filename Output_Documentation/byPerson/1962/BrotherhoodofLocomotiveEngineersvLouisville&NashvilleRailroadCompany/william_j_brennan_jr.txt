justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
you
--
i'm
not
sure.
could
you
go
into
court
for
this?
could
the
union
go
any
further?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
please
don't
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
situations
differ
when
and
when
not
--
there
may
be
an
enforcement
suit
if
i
recall
it,
don't
they?
whether
this
one
where
they
may
or
may
not
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
was
this
that
kind
of
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
say
something
in
price,
it
bears
on
this
mr.
heiss,
and
thrice
we
said
that
there
was
final
and
binding,
didn't
we
examine
that
whole
history
and
indicated
if
you
had
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
lost,
you
could
be
enjoined,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
do
you
have
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
an
award?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
the
price
--
the
employee
at
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
heiss,
for
my
information,
which
part
of
the
act
was
directly
involved
in
the
chicago
river
case?
was
it
section
3,
first
(i)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
right,
i'm
just
--
i
was
interested
because
i
gather
that
at
least
part
of
your
argument
is
based
on
the
use
of
the
word
“may
“
instead
of
“shall”
in
3
first
(p).
and
i
note
that
the
same
word
“may”
is
used
in
3
first
(i).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
can
see
why
you
don't.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
correct.
well,
i
could
quite
understand
why
you
don't.
