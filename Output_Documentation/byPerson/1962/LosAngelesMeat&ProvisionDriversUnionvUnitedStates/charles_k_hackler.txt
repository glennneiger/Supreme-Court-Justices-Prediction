mr.
charles
k.
hackler
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
this
case
is
a
case
of
first
impression
in
an
appellate
court,
involving
the
question
of
whether
under
the
antitrust
laws
of
the
united
states,
a
district
court
is
empowered
upon
a
finding
of
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
by
a
trade
union,
and
frame
a
remedy
which
in
addition
to
the
usual
prohibitory
injunctive
provisions
applicable
to
the
particular
restraints
of
trade
shown
goes
beyond
that
and
includes
the
following
three
orders
directed
to
the
trade
union.
first,
that
it
expel
from
its
membership
all
of
a
certain
class
of
members.
second,
that
it
be
perpetually
enjoined
from
ever
taking
that
class
of
workmen
into
membership
in
the
future.
thirdly,
that
if
any
present
member
of
the
union
should
become
a
member
of
that
class
by
virtue
of
his
manner
of
work
that
he
should
thereupon
summarily
be
expelled
from
the
union.
these
three
express
provisions
were
included
in
the
decree
below
by
the
subject
of
a
direct
appeal
from
a
single
judge
decision
here
as
the
sole
issue
before
the
court.
the
matter
is
of
importance
obviously
and
of
novelty
because
so
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
determine,
during
the
more
than
70
years
since
the
passage
of
the
original
antitrust
law,
the
sherman
act
was
not
until
1960
in
a
case
arising
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
that
this
kind
of
a
remedy
not
quite
as
drastic
as
this
but
in
the
same
vain
namely
the
forced
of
expulsion
of
union
members
was
ordered
by
district
court.
i
am
not
aware
in
the
government,
although
quite
diligent
in
digging
up
forms
of
decrees,
has
not
cited
one
whether
has
ever
been
a
consent
decree.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
referred
to
in
all
of
our
briefs
here.
it's
the
smokehouse
case
and
referred
to
by
the
decision
below
here.
this
case
arose
by
a
civil
complaint
being
filed
against
a
local
union
of
some
2400
members
whose
headquarters
is
in
los
angeles,
california.
these
members
for
the
most
part
are
engaged
in
truck
driving
and
loading
and
unloading
of
trucks
and
incidental
work
in
the
meat
and
provision
in
allied
industries
in
that
city.
in
addition
to
the
union,
it
was
made
a
defendant
one
of
its
business
agents
and
four
of
its
members
who
were
self-employed
meat
peddlers.
the
case
went
to
the
court
upon
a
comprehensive
stipulation
of
fact,
no
evidence
was
taken,
some
74
separate
items
of
facts
in
great
detail
were
stipulated
between
counsel
and
upon
a
stipulation
on
the
part
of
all
of
the
defendants
that
the
court,
that
they
had
violated
the
antitrust
laws
in
the
respects
shown,
a
further
stipulation
that
the
court
could
enter
an
order
that
such
violations
have
taken
place
and
also
a
decree
enjoining
each
and
every
type
of
violation
with
leaving
only
for
the
court's
decision
whether,
in
addition
to
that
ordinary
unusual
remedy,
there
should
in
addition
the
expulsion
remedies
that
i
just
described
and
which
had
been
a
part
of
the
prayer
of
the
government.
apparently
following
the
fish
smokers
case
in
1960,
it
has
become
in
this
type
of
case,
that
is
a
case
involving
so-called
?self-employed
workmen?
involved
in
an
antitrust
violation,
the
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
antitrust
division
to
seek
that
kind
of
a
broadened
decree.
the
court
took
the
stipulation
and
heard
argument
and
briefs,
handed
down
its
decision
agreeing
with
the
government
and
adding
the
three
specific
mandatory
injunctive
provisions
for
expulsion
and
refusal
of
membership
in
the
union.
now,
it
would
be
unduly
burdensome
upon
the
court
to
go
in
to
the
very
detailed
factual
situation.
it's
all
set
forth
in
a
stipulation
in
the
record
which
the
court
copied
in
haec
verba
in
his
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law.
suffice
it
to
say
that
that
stipulation
maybe
summarized
as
follows;
that
this
law
for
union
beginning
to
the
activities
primarily
of
the
individual
business
agent
who
was
joined
as
a
defendant
and
four
of
its
grease
peddler
members
who
comprise
a
grease
peddler
committee,
a
sort
of
a
self-anointed
committee
within,
to
their
activities
primarily
over
the
period
of
time
from
october
1954
to
the
time
of
the
complaint
in
may
of
1959,
engaged
in
a
plan
and
program
most
extensively
violative
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
program
consisted
primarily
of
the
following,
the
union
was
approached
by
some
10
or
more
grease
peddlers
in
the
city
of
los
angeles
who
found
that
their
earnings
have
suffered
for
the
past
couple
of
years,
they
asked
the
union
membership.
mr.
singer,
the
union
agent
on
behalf
of
the
union,
told
them
that
they
would
be
accepted
into
membership
and
then
and
there
an
arrangement
or
understanding
was
arrived
at
between
them
which
called
for
the
unionization
of
all
of
these
types
of
grease
peddlers
in
the
city
some
45
to
50
in
number,
an
arrangement
that
none
but
union
members
would
be
permitted
or
authorized
to
pick
up
grease
at
restaurants
and
sell
it
processing
houses,
an
arrangement
and
understanding
that
some
effort
would
be
made
to
stabilize
or
fix
the
price
at
which
these
peddlers
would
pay
the
restaurants
for
their
waste
grease
and
the
price
at
which
they
would
sell
the
waste
grease
to
the
processing
houses.
that
this
program
envisaged
the
raising
of
the
earnings
of
these
people.
these
earnings
were
based
upon
the
difference
between
the
buy
and
sell
price
of
the
waste
product.
that
the
conspiracy
was
carried
out
to
a
considerable
detail
and
in
candor
requires
me
to
state
in
many
instances
in
a
most
ruthless
manner
and
one
that
finds
neither
support
in
the
antitrust
laws
nor
in
morality
either
so
far
as
that
is
concerned.
these
individuals
and
the
agents
ran
wild.
they
used
picket
lines
inappropriately
to
accomplish
these
objectives
and
the
net
effect
of
it,
and
this
is
not
questioned
here
because
it
emerges
from
the
stipulation,
was
that
only
union
members
engaged
in
this
somewhat
peripheral
industry
in
that
city
that
prices
were
fixed,
territories
were
allocated,
it
was
an
agreement
among
these
union
members
not
to
compete
one
with
the
other.
the
evidence
disclosed,
and
this
is
somewhat
significant
i
believe,
that
this
small
segment
of
members
the
union
were
a
sort
of
an
internal
subdivision
given
the
name
of
local
626-b,
although
not
separately
chartered,
they
were
a
separate
division
so
to
speak.
they
held
separate
meetings,
this
committee
and
mr.
singer,
their
mentor,
handled
punishments
for
violation
of
the
rules
that
had
been
set
up
in
the
program
that
had
been
set
up,
and
in
all
practical
respects,
operated
separately
from
the
local.
i
point
out
as
perhaps
significant
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
very
detailed
stipulation
and
i
might
state
the
government
will
agree
with
me
that
whatever
the
government
said
it
had
evidence
to
prove,
i
agree
to
stipulate.
this
had
resulted.
there
had
been
a
companion
indictment.
discovery
was
quite
limited
and
the
facts
are
strong
as
the
government
could
make
them
as
the
price
of
the
decree,
be
that
as
it
may.
with
all
of
these,
there
is
nothing
in
the
decree
suggesting
action
on
the
part
of
the
elected
executive
board
of
the
local
union
or
the
2400
members
despite
the
fact
that
that
constitution
and
evidence
shows
that
it
is
an
autonomous
local,
its
members,
its
officers
elected,
and
conducted
membership
meetings.
that
is
not
said
by
way
of
retaliation
of
the
conduct
that
took
place
nor
to
say
that
the
local
union
was
not
responsible
because
its
responsible
officials
and
members
indeed
must
have
looked
the
other
way
when
this
rather
sordid
business
was
taking
place.
now
having
said
this
your
honors,
we
come
the
proposition
as
to
whether
or
not
under
these
set
of
facts,
it
is
appropriate
to
import
into
this
antitrust
case
the
concepts
of
divestiture,
divorcement
that
have
been
common
in
antitrust
cases,
involving
commercial
enterprises.
the
court
below
and
i
take
it
to
be
also
the
theory,
the
primary
theory
of
the
government
here,
addressed
itself,
so
far
as
i
know
the
first
time
in
an
antitrust
case,
to
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
these
grease
peddlers,
45
strong,
were
the
?proper
subject
of
unionization.?
he
said
that
they
were
not
the
proper
subject
of
unionization,
?unless
the
evidence
affirmatively
showed
that
at
the
trial
of
the
case
that
they
were
somehow
competitive
with
employee
and
truck
drivers
doing
the
same
kind
of
work
as
they
themselves
were
doing.?
and
secondly,
?unless
there
was
evidence
below
that
the
union's
motivation
in
taking
this
kind
of
individual
into
membership
was
a
desire
and
a
purpose
to
protect
the
negotiated
wages
and
working
conditions
of
the
employee,
truck
drivers
against
diminution
at
the
hands
of
the
self-employed
truck
driver.?
having
made
those
two
dicta,
the
court
said
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
72
stipulations
that
reasonably
could
--
the
--
that
an
inference
could
be
made
of
these
two
conclusions.
therefore
the
court
said,
these
men
are
businessmen,
they
are
entrepreneurs,
they
are
not
the
proper
subject
of
unionization.
that
being
true,
i
have
the
power,
indeed
the
duty,
under
this
aggravated
set
of
facts
to
perpetually
not
only
exclude
the
four
defendants,
the
45
other
peddlers
who
had
membership
in
the
union,
but
to
perpetually
enjoin
the
union
from
taking
into
membership
ever
in
the
future
a
self-employed
grease
peddler
regardless
of
its
motivation,
regardless
of
its
relationship
or
indeed
regardless
as
to
whether
even
that
peddler
had
any
knowledge
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
that
comes
your
honor
as
rather
a
surprise.
although,
the
findings
of
the
court
and
indeed
even
in
the
brief
in
this
court
the
correct
summary
of
the
court's
findings
repeatedly
referred
to
the
fact
that
it
was
this
small
segment,
a
sort
of
an
infiltration
of
the
union
or
a
misalliance
as
it
says
in
some
places
between
the
union
as
an
entity
and
the
small
segment,
that
this
small
segment
was
itself
the
conspiracy
when
a
decree
was
drafted,
there
was
nothing
said
about
that.
there
was
this,
without
any
explanation,
there
was
a
movement
cleared
over
to
the
general
body
of
the
union.
when
the
decree
was
drafted
both
the
court
and
opposing
counsel
unconsciously
perhaps
or
certainly
without
any
logic
in
the
record
moved
over
and
treated
the
commonality
of
the
2400
members.
the
whole
unincorporated
association,
they
equated
it
with
this
segment.
we
would
not
have
imposed
--
opposed
and
indeed
i
state
to
the
court
today
that
on
this
record,
certainly
no
one
could
reasonably
oppose
a
decree
that
ordered
this
union,
stop
having
a
separate
segment
within
your
membership,
separate
meetings
of
this
group
because
that
might
be
a
tendency
to
repeat
what
has
happened
in
the
past,
scatter
these
people
among
your
members.
there
is
no
legitimate
reason
to
have
these
self-employed
grease
peddlers
at
least
to
function
even
ad
hoc
separately
with
union
membership,
but
now
the
arguments
that
are
made
here
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
it's
my
understanding
that
they
were,
this
forced
expulsion
of
the
members.
the
case
was
not
appealed.
i
do
not
have
a
copy
of
the
decree,
but
the
government's
brief
states
that
the
decree
was
so
entered.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
yes,
your
honor.
actually,
all
that
626
--
the
chartered
local
union
affiliate
is
626.
this
was
only
an
informal
designation
of
a
segment
of
the
members.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
they
had
no
--
they
had
no
officers
but
according
to
the
stipulation
they
met
separately
in
sort
of
ad
hoc
meetings
in
this
committee
and
the
record
doesn't
show
where
it
came
from,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
they
had
a
right
to
vote.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
they
met
separately.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
yes
,your
honor.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
the
record
does
not
state
but
as
a
fact
they
were
entitled
to
and
they
did
subject
of
course
to
their
being
absent
because
they
didn't
care
to
attend.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
slightly
higher,
initiation
fee
and
slightly
higher
dues,
but
again
that
was
not
thought
to
be
by
the
government,
it
isn't
a
part
of
the
stipulation
but
it
is
a
fact.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
the
record
is
silent
as
to
that
and
no,
sir,
as
to
whether
they
all
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
record
only
shows
the
beginning
in
1954
after
the
10
fellow
members
of
this
group
came
to
the
union
to
ask
for
its
assistance
that
only
that
a
majority
of
them
joined,
entered
at
or
about
that
time.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
yes
,your
honor,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
yes.
i
think
perhaps
the
crux
of
this
and
we
can
save
time
if
i
just
read
two
very
brief
paragraphs
from
the
findings
which
it
seems
to
me
that
on
the
face
of
them
show
a
legitimate
interest
to
this
union
in
representing
these
people.
this,
i'm
reading
from
page
57
of
the
record,
it's
finding
of
fact
6;
?this
self-employed
peddlers
had
no
established
places
of
business,
no
employees
except
an
occasional
loader,
no
capital
investment
except
a
small
equity
in
a
truck,
no
skill
or
special
qualifications
except
the
ability
to
load,
unload
and
drive
a
truck.
they
drive
from
restaurant
to
restaurant,
picking
up
small
amounts
of
waste
grease
in
cans
and
on
the
same
day,
transport
and
unload
the
entire
collection
to
one
of
the
processing
companies.
their
earnings
represent
the
difference
between
the
buy
and
sell
price
of
the
waste
grease
diminished
by
the
cost
of
maintaining
and
operating
the
truck.?
paragraph
16
on
page
59
as
to
the
employee
drivers,
?for
many
years
baker,
western
tallow,
peterson
and
to
a
lesser
extent
washington,
those
are
four
of
the
eight
processors
in
that
city,
used
the
services
of
employee-truck
members
of
defendant
union
under
union
contracts
to
pickup
and
transport
the
restaurant
grease
and
other
meat
waste
purchased
by
them
directly
from
hotels,
restaurants,
and
institutions.
such
purchases
were
usually
made
from
larger
establishments
and
the
grease
peddlers
usually
applied
restaurant
grease
from
the
smaller
establishments
and
other
sources
where
the
supply
of
restaurant
grease
was
relatively
small
or
irregular
in
unavailability."
now,
another
stipulation
here
sets
forth
that
of
the
eight
processors
in
that
city,
these
four
used
in
varying
degrees
employees
as
well
as
peddlers
to
pickup
the
grease
and
two
of
them
used
employees
under
union
contract
exclusively.
well,
it
was
our
feeling
below
and
we
feel
that
it
is
--
this
is
a
strong
argument
here
that
these
two
stipulations
alone
are
sufficient
to
show
under
the
rulings
of
this
court,
the
legitimacy
of
the
interest
of
this
union
in
representing
having
something
to
do
with,
taking
into
membership
these
grease
peddlers
independently
of
any
antitrust
problem.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
that
isn't
--
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
now,
our
--
we
feel
the
court
that
--
i
think
a
fundamental
difference
aside
from
the
non-sequesters
as
we
see
it
in
the
government
and
the
court's
reasoning
namely
to
move
from
a
small
segment
of
people
who
misallied
themselves
with
the
union,
to
use
the
government's
own
expression
many
times
in
its
brief.
in
place
of
dissolving
that
misalliance
by
putting
to
an
end,
if
you
will,
whatever
combination
existed
separately
within
the
union
of
these
people,
that
the
misalliance
was
forgotten
and
the
scene
of
the
few
was
visited
upon
many,
and
a
forfeiture
worked
upon
the
whole
union
in
what
otherwise
clearly
on
this
record
would
be
its
legitimate
right
to
protect
itself
and
its
employee-drivers
from
the
inherent
competition
of
workman
doing
precisely
the
same
work,
on
precisely
the
same
kind
of
equipment,
with
precisely
the
same
tools
for
precisely
the
same
economic
--
precisely
the
same
businessmen,
the
only
difference
be
--
being,
the
manner
of
payment.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
no,
your
honor,
the
record
is
silent
as
to
that.
other
than
percentages
and
--
that
for
example,
the
four
that
i
mentioned
here,
i
think
there
is
one
stipulation
here.
no,
that's
the
substance
of
it.
i
don't
like
to
be
so
vague
in
these
matters
but
this
stipulation
is
what
the
government
asked
for
and
the
only
thing
i
got
in
the
stipulation,
to
be
painfully
honest,
was
this
paragraph
6
which
described
the
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
there
is
a
finding
by
the
court
and
that
moves
me
to
i
think
our
fundamental
difference
with
the
government
and
with
the
court.
the
court
said
these
findings,
he
concludes
from
these
stipulations,
that
there
was
no
competition,
by
which
he
means
there's
no
direct
evidence.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
it's
in
the
court's
decision
actually.
stating
the
two
basis,
the
grease

of
the
record

mr.
charles
k.
hackler
?
the
transcript.
members
of
--
the
members
of
defendant
union
engaged
in
loading,
unloading,
and
transporting
meat
and
meat
products
for
packing
houses
and
related
employers.
every
processor
of
yellow
grease
in
the
los
angeles
area
has
employees
who
were
members
of
the
defendant
union.
the
grease
peddler
defendants
--
dependents
or
independent
self-employed
businessmen
who
purchased
waste
grease
from
restaurants
and
other
institutions
and
then
transported
the
grease
in
their
own
trucks
to
the
processing
companies
to
whom
they
sell
the
grease.
now,
the
conclusion;
these
facts
do
not
show
that
there
is
competition
between
the
peddlers
and
the
union
employees
or
the
processors.
on
the
contrary,
there
is
no
competition
between
these
groups.
this
is
significant
because
each
is
engaged
in
a
different
line
of
work.
the
peddler
is
buying
grease,
transporting
and
selling
it
to
the
processors
and
the
union
members
performing
other
functions
for
their
employers.
by
that
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
no
your
honor,
for
this
reason
i
take
really
two
approaches
to
the
thing.
first,
i
think
the
court
is
wrong
in
saying
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind
there
must
be
specific
evidence
before
that
court
of
the
union's
right
to
represent
these
people
where
the
overall
situation
shows
that
there
is
an
economic
interplay
of
the
two
groups.
or
put
it
in
another
way,
very
frequently,
a
union
has
a
right
to
organize
or
represent
people
before
there
has
become
a
conflict,
before
the
owner-operator
or
peddler
has
undermined
his
working
conditions.
he
has
a
right
because
of
his
economic
position.
now,
we
think
we're
right
there
because
certainly
this
court
has
said
so
without
any
evidence
in
the
duplex
case
where
they
said
it
was
a
victim
of
the
trade
union
movement,
that
persons
in
a
trade
union
necessarily
are
interested
in
the
standards
of
work
and
earnings
for
their
craft
in
the
community.
the
court
didn't
say
there
was
evidence
below.
now,
we
feel
that
certainly,
i'll
put
it
in
another
way,
certainly
in
drafting
a
decree
which
is
only
supposed
to
be
protective
of
the
policies
of
the
act,
not
itself
full
dressed,
where
the
violations
are
clear,
we
feel
that
it
isn't
incumbent
upon
us
to
come
in
and
say,
to
do
so
might
nullify
the
very
value
to
the
union
of
representing
those
people.
they
would
say
that
--
we
would
have
to
wait
until
conditions
have
been
broken
down.
the
second,
and
i
think
to
me
much
more
cogent
point
and
one
that
the
court
just
brushed
over
without
really
any
consideration
and
that
is
the
express
provisions
of
the
clayton
act
with
respect
to
labor
unions.
now,
this
raises
the
whole
question
and
i
think
this
is
why
70
years
had
gone
by
without
there
being
divestitures
of
union
membership,
although
there
have
been
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
i
would
say
no,
assuming
the
factors
as
follows,
that
this
is
not
a
separate
labor
organization.
i
would
go
along
and
say,
that
if
businessmen
cannot
labor
themselves
a
labor
organization
and
thereby
achieve
any
sort
of
immunity
under
the
statute.
i
say,
however,
if
a
man
--
in
one
context
are
businessmen,
businessmen
workers
as
some
courts
call
them
and
if
they
align
themselves
within
otherwise
legitimate
labor
organization
that
the
antitrust
laws
forbid
that
and
order
expelling
them
from
that
union.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
no,
they
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
the
problem
is
the
scope
of
the
remedy.
no
one
says
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
oh,
yes,
and
they
were
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
they
were
enjoined
in
great
detail
here,
i
am
simply
saying
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
sport
short
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
that
is
correct
and
i
say
that
that
comes
from
statutory
--
has
a
statutory
basis.
now,
this
court
has
in
effect
said
that
i
will
find
by
the
nature
of
the
man's
work
that
if
he's
at
common
law
and
independent
contractor
and
a
non-employee,
he
isn't
a
proper
subject
of
unionization
unless
you
prove
certain
facts.
we
say
on
the
contrary
that
in
the
clayton
act,
the
language
expressly
moves
away
from
common
law
concepts.
take
the
broad
language
it
starts
with
in
section
6,
?the
labor
of
a
human
being
is
not
a
commodity
or
article
of
commerce.
nothing
contained
in
the
antitrust
law
shall
be
construed
to
forbid
the
existence
and
operation
of
a
labor,
agricultural
or
horticultural
organization
instituted
for
the
purpose
of
one,
mutual
help;
two,
not
having
capital
stock;
or
three,
or
not
conducted
for
profit
or
to
forbid
or
restrain
individual
members.?
now
it
doesn't
say
employees
are
independent,
it
says
members
of
such
organizations
from
lawfully
carrying
out
the
legitimate
objectives
thereof
nor
shall
such
organization
and
this
is
significant
or
the
members
thereof
be
held
or
construed
to
be
an
illegal
combination.
now,
the
government
keeps
saying,
we're
not
holding
the
union
as
such
an
illegal
combination.
that's
the
--
but
in
reality
accept
semantically
you
are
when
you
tell
a
union
perpetually
you,
of
all
of
the
unions
in
this
country
cannot
take
into
membership
a
class
of
workers
and
these
men
work.
they
pickup
grease
and
cans
and
put
them
on
trucks
and
all
of
them,
to
the
processing
plant.
they
do
precisely
the
same
physical
labor
with
precisely
the
same
tool
that
the
employee
does.
the
only
thing
that's
different
with
these
men
is
their
method
of
compensation.
and
that
was
--
and
i
say
that
the
drafters
by
the
very
language
itself,
they
departed
from
common
law
concepts.
now,
the
government
would
read
this
as
saying
where
it
says
flatly
you
can't
order
members
out
of
a
union,
they
would
say
employee
members.
now,
there's
a
footnote
in
the
government's
brief
where
it
says,
a
different
and
more
difficult
question
would
be
involved,
and
this
is
the
danger
of
these
kind
of
cases,
if
these
men
were
not
--
if
their
payment
was
not
based
on
the
buy
and
--
difference
between
the
buy
and
sell
price
of
a
product,
but
they
were
still
technically
independent
contractors.
so
that
even
now
the
government
is
apparently
trying
to
push
back
the
right
of
a
trade
union
to
employees
in
dealing
with
employers.
mr.
justice
black
had
to
deal
with
a
similar
effort
to
restrict
the
scope
of
the
norris
and
--
oh,
i'm
sorry,
and
the
clayton
act
in
the
chicago
northwestern
railroad
case
where
the
argument
was
that
if
the
subject
matter
of
the
labor
dispute
could
not
be
the
subject
of
negotiation,
it
wasn't
a
labor
dispute
and
they
correctly
held
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
--
that
was
not
the
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
there
are
--
only
in
this
sense
there's
a
broad
visitation,
a
provision
in
the
decree
and
the
right
to
inspect
records
and
to
order
reports
from
the
union
from
time
to
time.
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
the
government
suggest,
we
would
have
such
an
opportunity.
there
is
nothing
in
the
decree,
i
think
i
should
say
that
neither
says
that
we
can
or
cannot
--
mr.
charles
k.
hackler
--
show
them.
thank
you.
