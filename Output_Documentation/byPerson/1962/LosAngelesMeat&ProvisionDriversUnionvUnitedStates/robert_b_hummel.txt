mr.
robert
b.
hummel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
start
by
addressing
myself
to
the
question
of
the
clayton
act.
i
refer
the
court
to
footnote
in
the
columbia
river
packers
association
versus
hinton,
where
the
court
says,
cf.
section
6
of
the
clayton
act,
a
labor
of
a
human
being
is
not
a
commodity
or
article
of
commerce,
38
stat.
731.
the
norris-laguardia
act
manifesting
the
purpose
of
the
congress
further
to
extend
the
prohibition
of
section
20
of
the
clayton
act,
new
negro
alliance
versus
grocery
company,
cannot
be
taken
as
having
erased
the
distinction
between
an
association
of
commodity
sellers
and
association
of
employees.
now
in
this
case,
the
court
is
dealing
with
an
association
of
commodity
sellers.
626-b
is
an
association
of
independent
businessmen
by
stipulation.
the
court,
we
submit,
need
it
to
dissolve
626-b
in
order
to
prevent
future
violations
of
law
and
in
order
to
restore
competition.
we
submit
that
nothing
in
the
policy
of
labor
laws
protects
an
association
of
independent
businessmen
formed
within
a
labor
union
from
dissolution
which
is
ordered
as
a
result
of
a
necessity
arising
from
previous
violation
of
law.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
your
honor.
it
was
not
discussed
in
the
court's
opinion.
it
was
issued
as
a
matter
of
course
by
way
of
relief
and
no
appeal
was
taken.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
this
was
the
only
case
that
i'm
aware
of,
yes,
your
honor.
i
shall
not
review
the
facts.
they've
been
candidly
and
fully
stated
by
counsel,
but
by
way
of
preliminary,
we
suggest
that
the
dissolution
of
a
trade
association
is
not
an
unusual
remedy.
this
court
itself
decreed
such
relief
in
the
hartford-empire
case
where
lower
court
injunctions
against
an
association
whose
primary
functions
were
dissemination
of
trade
statistics
which
have
been
used
to
violate
the
sherman
act.
the
court
--
lower
court
had
enjoined
the
dissemination
of
such
statistics.
now,
this
court
said
there's
very
little
left
to
this
association
in
order
to
protect
against
future
violations,
we
shall
order
it
to
be
dissolved.
we
do
not
however
rely
simply
on
this
decision
because
we
realize
that
in
each
of
these
cases
the
relief
depends
upon
the
facts
of
case.
there
has
to
be
a
need
for
this
kind
of
relief.
we
submit
that
the
lower
court
was
fully
justified
because
there
was
here
such
relief.
i
may
say
that
the
suggestion
that
626-b
would
somehow
be
dissolved
without
excluding
it
from
the
union
is
a
surprise
to
us.
626-b
only
existed
as
a
subdivision
of
the
union
and
it
derived
its
strength
and
its
power
from
its
association
with
the
union
and
we
submit
that
the
lower
court's
judgment
in
this
respect
was
quite
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
well,
we
submit
your
honor
that
there
is
power
because
the
power
of
the
equity
court
is
to
remedy
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
was
not
certain
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
what
is
the
nature
of
?
we
think
it's
quite
clear
that
there
was
power
that
the
power
of
the
equity
court
is
to
remedy
a
situation
to
prevent
future
violations
and
to
restore
possibility
of
competition.
we
submit
first
of
all
that
this
626-b
comprised
within
its
membership
some
persons
who
were
forced
in.
the
original
plan
was,
as
counsel
stated,
that
those
peddlers
who
did
not
voluntarily
joined
would
be
forced
to
the
membership
because
they
would
have
no
place
to
sell
their
grease.
the
record
shows
only
one
such
peddler,
but
we
are
entitled
to
assume,
i
believe,
that
there
were
others.
now,
we
submit
that
to
get
such
peddlers
out
to
freedom
from
the
association
with
the
union
into
which
they
have
been
forced
was
necessary
for
the
court
order
that
all
be
excluded
from
the
union.
so
as
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
any
of
these
individuals
having
to
stand
up
and
take
the
chance
of
retaliation
in
a
circumstance
where
conduct
as
counsel
has
quite
accurately
described
it,
was
ruthless
and
we
submit
it
was
also
devious
and
generally
in
this
regard
of
the
law.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
your
honor.
but
we
submit
that
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
these
members
were
independent
businessmen
and
this
we
think
makes
a
difference.
our
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
your
honor,
if
your
honor
please,
i
am
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes
your
honor,
but
i
am
also
suggesting
that
these
members
would
have
reason
to
fear
retaliation
and
therefore
would
not
get
out
of
the
union
as
a
result
of
that
fear.
in
this
context
and
the
court
was
entitled
to
take
that
consideration
into
account
and
therefore
to
order
that
all
get
out.
second,
we
submit
that
one
legitimate
and
proper
purpose
of
a
sherman
act
decree
is
to
place
opportunity
and
temptation
beyond
the
reach
of
the
defendants
where
there
is
an
absence
of
strong
purpose
for
a
continued
association.
this
issue
we
think
speaks
for
itself
here.
the
defendants
in
this
case
engaged
in
--
finally
in
an
agreement
to
conceal
the
evidence
of
our
conspiracy
engaged
and
forced
--
threats
of
force
--
i'm
sorry,
that
if
--
there
is
no
stipulation
of
force.
there
were
threats
of
force.
there
were
faults,
strikes
called
in
a
situation
where
the
purpose
was
to
coerce
business
activity.
we
think
that
this
is
the
kind
of
conduct
which
this
court
had
in
mine
in
the
crescent
case,
in
the
hartford-empire
case
where
it
spoke
of
the
proclivities
of
the
defendants
and
the
opportunities
for
continued
violation.
i
believe
that
the
district
court
had
power
to
place
beyond
the
reach
of
these
defendants,
temptation
and
the
opportunities
for
further
violation.
i
don't
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
we
submit
that
wound
is
left
your
honor.
there
is
a
continuing
jurisdiction
in
the
court
to
modify
an
equity
decree
to
resolve
the
change
of
circumstances
and
if
upon
a
showing
that
there
were
some
change
of
circumstances,
the
defendants
could
come
in,
present
to
this
court
a
situation
which
would
present
a
legitimate
reason
for
these
persons
to
be
associated
in
this
union
and
allowing
a
sufficient
lapse
of
time
to
assume
that
the
extent
of
the
violations
of
law
had
been
ameliorated,
then
we
submit
that
the
court
could
modify
its
decree.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
we
would
not
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
no,
your
honor
and
i
think
this
reflects
the
fact
that
this
could
not
result
from
a
general
policy
of
the
department
of
justice
to
ask
that
independent
peddlers
be
excluded
from
union
membership
whether
independent
businessmen.
mr.
robert
b.
hummel
i
was
coming
to
that
your
honor.
that
is
our
third
reason
for
a
necessity
for
dissolution.
here
are
two
processors,
consisting
of
the
only
two
persons
in
this
market,
who
are
still
a
market
for
peddlers.
one
of
them
is
a
union
member.
he
owes
his
existence
in
this
business
virtually
to
the
union
in
1958,
the
star
grease,
in
1958,
when
this
company
began
business,
came
to
the
union
representative
and
said,
?we're
having
trouble
selling
our
grease,
and
would
you
dispose
80000
pounds
of
it
for
us.?
the
union
business
representatives
went
to
another
one,
another
processor
and
said,
?would
you
sell
it
for
him??
this
processor
fearing
union
trouble
did.
shortly
thereafter,
in
meeting
of
the
union
committee
and
the
processors,
this
processor,
star
grease,
was
given
one-third
of
the
available
supply
of
the
grease
supplied
by
these
peddlers.
at
this
meeting,
the
union
business
representative
myer
singer
was
a
defendant
here
represented
star
grease.
and
so
here
we
have
a
company,
three
and
a
half
months
after
he's
gone
into
a
business
getting
one-third
of
the
available
supply
as
a
result
of
meeting
of
the
union
and
at
the
same
time
having
the
union
help
in
disposing
of
its
grease.
this
is
one
of
the
two
processors
left.
the
other
one,
one
member
of
that
firm
is
a
union
member
and
the
other
is
a
--
his
partner
has
six
months
after
the
institution
of
this
case
and
threatened
by
the
business
representative
of
the
union
and
told
that
when
another
processor
had
been
taking
care
of
him,
he
would
be
next
because
he
had
testified
before
a
senate
investigating
committee.
now,
in
this
circumstance,
we
think
that
the
court
to
free
up
this
market,
to
provide
a
place
where
peddlers
who
did
not
wish
to
belong
to
the
union
could
sell
their
grease
without
being
discriminated
against
because
they
either
did
or
did
not
represent
themselves
to
be
union
members.
the
court
could
properly
order
that
these
members
be
excluded
from
the
union.
so
that
we
conclude
that
there
was
a
necessity
here
and
arose
not
of
any
general
policy
that
independent
peddlers
ought
not
to
belong
to
a
union
but
out
of
these
specific
facts
of
this
case.
a
point
is
also
made
with
respect
to
the
alleged
fact
of
due
process
with
respect
to
those
peddlers
who
were
not
before
the
court
and
that
issue
has
not
been
argued
and
we
rest
on
our
brief.
we
ask
that
the
decree
of
the
lower
court
be
affirmed.
