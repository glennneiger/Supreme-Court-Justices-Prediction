there
a

in

justice

would
you
concede
that
if
that
were
true,
that
this

not
improper?
justice

now,
let's
take
a
case
of
--
where
there
clearly
was
not
actual
or
potential
economic
competition.
let's
say
that
all
the
retail
druggists
in
the
los
angeles
area
joined
the
teamsters
union
and
formed
a
sub-local
and
in
that
guise
carried
on
flagrant
violations
of
the
antitrust
law.
couldn't
the
court
order
then
that
the
union
expel
them
and
keep
them
out?

stewart
the
automobile
industry
joined
a
labor
union,
they
could
carry
on
violations
of
the
antitrust
law
and
the
court
couldn't
order
the
general
motors
and
the
ford
motor
company
and
chrysler
be
--
justice
potter

--
expelled
from
teamsters

mr.
hackler,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
sit
down
i
have
question
of
fact.
did
the
district
court
retain
jurisdiction
with
this
controversy?
justice
potter
stewart
what
was
on
my
mind
was
whether
--
would
there
be
an
opportunity
for
you
at
some
subsequent
time
to
show
potential
or
actual
competition
among
these
indi
--
independent
contractor
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
cannot
show.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
you're
as
--
assuming,
assuming
that
the
district
court
did
have
power
to
do
what
it
did?
does
it
strike
you
that
the
decree
is
a
little
bit
inflexible,
conditions
might
change.
they're
certainly
just
as
--
from
the
underlying
facts,
there
is
a
potential
competition
between
these
individuals
--
the
independent
contractors
and
employee-drivers.
certainly,
there's
nothing
that
prevents
non-employees
from
being
members
of
the
union
along
with
employees.
we
had
that
meba
case
last
term
involving
that
[inaudible]
?
shouldn't
?
[inaudible]
left
for
a
change
conditions
as
to,
refused
membership
at
any
time
in
the
future,
to
any
grease
peddlers,
isn't
it
a
little
bit
inflexible?
