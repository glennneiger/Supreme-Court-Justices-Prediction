mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
sharing
the
argument
for
the
appellants
in
these
cases
with
mr.
langdon,
counsel
for
the
appellant,
railroads
and
mr.
marbury,
counsel
for
the
appellant
ports
served
by
the
appellant
railroads.
the
consolidated
appeals
and
from
the
decision
of
a
three
judge
court
in
the
district
of
massachusetts,
which
set
aside
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
commission's
order
issued
after
suspension
of
tariffs
an
extensive
administrative
proceedings
required
the
cancellation
of
two
sets
of
proposed
railroad
rates
on
export
and
import
traffic
excluding
iron
ore,
coal,
and
coke
moving
between
the
north
atlantic
ports,
which
are
the
ports
of
norfolk
north,
norfolk,
baltimore,
philadelphia,
new
york,
albany,
boston,
portland
maine
on
the
one
hand
and
an
interior
area
known
as
differential
territory.
differential
territory
consists
of
the
states,
points
in
the
states
of
illinois,
indiana,
ohio,
michigan
except
the
northern
peninsula
and
strips
of
wisconsin
and
pennsylvania.
i
might
identify
export
import
rates.
export
import
rates
in
much
of
the
united
states
are
at
a
lower
level
than
the
domestic
rates
to
and
from
the
same
port.
for
example,
through
the
north
atlantic
ports,
the
average
export
rate
is
$0.25
and
the
average
import
rate
is
$0.115
per
100
pounds,
below
the
corresponding
domestic
rates.
specifically,
the
commission
ordered
the
cancellation
of
reduced
rates
proposed
by
the
railroads
serving
albany,
boston,
portland,
and
new
york,
which
we
all
refer
to
as
the
northern
tier
ports.
the
purpose
of
their
proposal
was
to
equalize
at
the
level
of
the
rates
applicable
to
and
from
baltimore.
the
export
import
rates
to
and
from
these
northern
tier
ports
with
the
export
import
rates
to
and
from
the
southern
tier
ports
of
baltimore,
philadelphia,
and
hampton
roads.
secondly,
the
commission
ordered
the
cancellation
of
conditional
and
retaliatory
rate
reductions
filed
by
the
railroads
serving
the
southern
tier
ports.
now
the
export
import
rates
on
most
traffic
on
differential
territory
to
and
from
philadelphia
are
$0.02
per
100
pounds
below
the
rates
applicable
to
and
from
new
york.
baltimore
has
rates
$0.03
per
100
pounds
below
new
york.
hampton
roads
has
rates
$0.03
below
new
york
for
the
western
port
points
in
the
western
portion
of
differential
territory.
boston
has
the
same
level
of
rates
as
new
york.
portland
has
rates
at
the
new
york
level
except
it
has
import
rates
on
the
baltimore
level
on
import
traffic
which
moves
through
portland
and
via
canadian
lines
into
differential
territory.
these
rate
differences
on
export
import
traffic
have
been
known
for
many
years
as
the
north
atlantic
port
differentials
and
their
basic
structure
has
been
in
existence
with
brief
intervals
since
1877.
so
the
basic
geography
of
this
90-year-old
transportation
dispute
is
this,
the
average
distance
from
points
in
differential
territory
is
698
miles
to
baltimore,
750
miles
to
philadelphia,
804
miles
to
new
york
and
921
miles
to
boston.
the
purpose
of
the
rate
reductions
proposed
by
the
railroads
serving
the
northern
tier
ports
was
to
eliminate
these
differentials
and
the
purpose
of
the
conditional
and
retaliatory
rate
proposals
of
the
line
serving
the
southern
tier
ports
was
to
preserve
the
existing
differentials
at
a
lower
rate
level
if,
but
only
if
the
reduced
rates
proposed
by
the
northern
alliance
were
approved.
the
commission
found
that
the
proposed
reduced
rates
to
albany,
new
york,
portland,
and
boston
separately
and
collectively
are
not
shown
to
be
reasonably
related
to
the
present
rates
in
light
traffic
between
the
same
interior
points
and
the
southern
tier
points.
and
that
they
would
result
in
undue
preference
of
and
advantage
to
the
named
ports
and
undue
prejudice
and
disadvantage
to
the
southern
tier
ports.
section
31
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
the
great
anti-discrimination
section
provides
that
it
should
be
unlawful
for
any
railroad
to
give
any
undue
or
unreasonable
preference
or
advantage
to
any
particular
person,
locality,
port
and
conversely
to
subject
any
person,
locality
or
port
to
undue
or
unreasonable
prejudice
or
disadvantage.
now
summarizing
the
issues
before
the
commission,
because
of
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
what
the
precise
issues
were
then
and
are
now.
the
commission
had
before
the
proposal
of
a
northern
alliance
to
eliminate
the
differential.
their
basic
justification
was
that
the
existing
differentials
resulted
in
an
undue
diversion
of
traffic
to
the
southern
alliance
and
to
the
southern
ports.
they
contemned
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
differentials
was
to
offset
lower
steamship
rates
at
new
york
and
boston
than
existed
at
the
southern
tier
ports.
so
offset
in
the
sense
of
creating
a
uniform
through
rate
from
the
internal
point
to
european
destination
no
matter
what
port
the
movement
went
through.
and
they
contemned
that
with
the
equalization
of
the
steamship
rates
by
1935.
there
was
no
further
justification
for
differentials
and
that
they
were
entitled
to
rate
parity
with
the
southern
tier
ports
regardless
of
the
distance
and
cost
advantages
of
the
railroads
serving
the
southern
tier
ports,
they
say
cost
distance
had
nothing
to
with
it.
now,
the
line
serving
the
southern
tier
port
justified,
sought
to
justify
their
retaliatory
rate
reduction
to
maintain
the
differentials
on
the
ground
that
if
they
were
eliminated
there
would
be
an
undue
diversion
of
export
import
traffic
to
the
northern
tier
ports,
particularly
to
new
york.
it
is
fundamental
in
this
case
that
none
of
the
railroads
northern
or
southern
decided
merely
to
move
the
structure
of
differentials
rates
down
to
a
lower
rate
level,
thereby
dissipating
their
revenues
in
a
rate
war.
the
real
issue
was
whether
the
commission
was
to
impose
rate
parity
on
the
railroads
handling
export
import
traffic
to
the
north
atlantic
ports
from
portland
to
northern
that
is
to
enforce
the
elimination
of
the
port
differentials.
this
issue
was
made
very
clear
in
the
motion
to
affirm
filed
in
this
court
by
all
of
the
railroad
appellees.
they
said
it
is
fundamental
that
if
the
appellee
railroads
lawfully
reduced
their
rates
to
basis
of
equality
with
the
rates
of
the
opponent
railroads
as
a
matter
of
necessity
in
order
to
meet
competition.
then
a
retaliatory
reduction
by
appellants
must
be
condemned
as
unnecessary
to
meet
competition.
the
boston
appellees
stick
to
that
position
in
their
main
brief
here,
the
new
york
appellees
are
ambiguous.
the
commission
considered
an
unusual
detail,
these
conflicting
claims
adds
to
the
diversion
resulting
from
equalization
or
from
the
differentials.
some
of
its
largely
unchallenged
findings
maybe
summarized
in
part
here.
i
say
in
part
because
the
commission
reports
are
likely
and
in
great
detail
on
this
very
complicated
matter.
commission
pointed
out
that
the
present
differentials
measured
in
cents
per
hundred
pounds
have
lost
much
of
their
relative
importance
by
reason
of
the
great
increase
in
freight
rates
and
in
the
value
of
commodities
since
1877.
the
differentials
have
stayed
at
$0.02
and
$0.03,
if
they
had
increased
proportionally
with
the
rate
level
they'd
be
$0.10
or
$0.12
or
$0.15.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
1877.
and
they
are
less
than
the
differences
in
domestic
rates
between
the
same
points,
because
the
domestic
rates
generally
reflect
differences
in
distance
and
services.
now,
this
export/import
traffic
here
involved
is
of
two
types;
bulk
cargo
and
general
cargo.
the
largest
in
volume
is
the
bulk
cargo,
consisting
largely
of
low
value
commodities,
which
are
loaded
and
unloaded
by
mechanical
facilities.
general
cargo
includes
manufactured
and
semi-manufactured
goods
of
relatively
high
value
and
usually
packaged
in
some
form.
the
general
cargo
requires
far
more
supplemental
service
and
handling
in
a
port
than
does
bulk
cargo.
so,
it's
the
general
cargo,
which
provides
a
much
greater
employment
and
revenue
per
ton
to
a
port
than
does
bulk
cargo.
now,
there
is
a
great
deal
on
the
record
in
the
commissions
findings
as
to
the
general
dominance
of
the
port
of
new
york
and
the
atlantic
export
and
foreign
trade,
it's
so
well
known,
i
won't
bother
to
go
into
it.
moreover,
we're
concerned
here
only
with
the
effect
of
the
differentials
upon
that
portion
of
the
north
atlantic
foreign
trade,
which
moves
to
and
from
differential
territory.
the
commission
found
the
evidence
inadequate
to
show
the
comparative
trends
in
the
movement
of
differential
territory
traffic
between
the
northern
tier
ports
versus
the
southern
tier
ports.and
because
it
couldn't
determine
--
what
the
trend
had
been,
it
was
unable
to
make
a
finding
that
with
the
elimination
of
the
steamship
differentials
by
1935,
there
had
followed
a
diversion
of
traffic,
an
undue
diversion
of
traffic
to
the
southern
lines
and
southern
ports
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
one
of
the
factors,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
sir,
i
would
not.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
i
will
point
out
later,
the
commission
found
in
1905
that
the
differentials
at
all
times
exceeded
the
differences
in
steamship
rates,
they
were
not
tailored
together.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
just
those
two.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i
can
answer
it
very
briefly
sir
right
now.
the
commission
has
gone
to
great
lengths
and
equalizing
rates
on
different
coasts.
moreover,
to
enable
a
small
dominated
port
to
compete
at
least
some
of
the
traffic.
the
commission
has
never
enforced
parity,
where
it
would
result
in
a
diversion
of
traffic,
an
undue
diversion
of
traffic
to
an
already
dominant
port
such
as
new
york.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
--in
a
case
which
i
will
discuss
later
and
which
came
before
this
court
in
the
texas
and
pacific
case,
the
commission
intervened
in
the
galveston,
houston
situation
to
require
the
differentials
we
established
in
favor
of
galveston
recognizing
its
distance
advantages
so
that
it
could
compete
in
terms
of
its
geographical
location
with
the
port
of
new
orleans.
and
that
by
the
way
was
a
case
in
which
the
steamship
rates
to
the
two
ports
were
the
same,
it's
very
similar
to
the
present
case.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
i'm
sure
it's
lost
the
deal
to
houston.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
but
it
was
the
galveston,
new
orleans
situation
which
led
to
this
court's
decision
in
texas
and
pacific
case,
which
in
turn
led
to
what
we
think
was
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
the
decisive
1935
amendment
of
section
3(1).
now
there
was
on
the
record
before
the
commission
a
detailed
study
for
a
test
year
ending
july
1956
and
the
movement
of
traffic
export/import
traffic
to
and
from
differential
territory.
the
commission
summarized
that
and
i
would
like
the
quote
it,
because
i
know
it's
very
important
“of
a
total
of
about
11
million
tons
of
exports
and
imports,
exclusive
of
import
petroleum,
iron
ore
and
export
coal
handled
between
the
north
atlantic
ports
that's
all
of
those
ports
and
the
effective
territory
about
one-third
moved
through
the
northern
tier
ports.
the
preponderance
of
the
tonnage
passed
through
the
southern
tier
ports,
but
as
the
imports,
the
excess
consisted
almost
wholly
of
ores
other
than
iron
ore
and
as
for
exports,
it
was
represented
wholly
grain
and
grain
products.”
the
commission
went
on,
the
complete
dominance
by
new
york
of
the
north
atlantic
general
cargo
traffic
to
and
from
the
differential
territory
is
clear.
of
imports,
its
volume
exceed
of
that
of
all
the
other
ports
combined
was
more
than
double
out
of
baltimore
and
almost
four
times
that
of
hampton
roads.
as
to
general
cargo
exports
new
york's
volume
was
62.7%
of
the
total
volume
for
all
of
the
north
atlantic
ports
and
over
50%
greater
than
the
southern
tier
ports
combined.
now
the
commission
didn't
have
any
trouble
finding
out
how
new
york
was
able
to
attract
this
traffic
not
withstanding
the
differentials.
new
york
has
a
preponderance
of
excellent
steamship
services
far
surpassing
that
available
to
southern
tier
ports.
the
general
cargo
services
have
much
more
frequent
sailings
to
a
wide
variety
of
trading
areas
around
the
world
and
its
supplemental
port
services
ranging
from
international
banking
to
stevedoring,
freight
forwarding,
marine
insurance
are
unique
among
the
north
atlantic
ports.
so,
the
commission
concluded
that
new
york
with
its
superior
port
services
was
able
to
attract
most
of
the
general
cargo
traffic
not
withstanding
the
lower
rates,
the
differentially
lower
rates
to
philadelphia
and
baltimore.
and
indeed
attracted
export
traffic
from
shippers
in
the
backyard,
a
few
miles
from
baltimore
and
philadelphia
ports.
the
commission
concluded
from
such
circumstances
that
the
proposed
rate
equalization
would
result
in
an
undue
diversion
of
traffic
from
the
southern
tier
ports
to
the
northern
tier
ports
and
particularly
new
york.
the
commission
found
that
the
proposed
rate
equalization
would
not
materially
affect
the
flow
of
traffic
through
boston,
portland
and
albany
and
has
based
that
conclusion
on
the
fact
that
boston,
which
has
long
had
the
same
rates
as
new
york
and
albany,
which
as
for
years
had
lower
rates
than
new
york
on
the
philadelphia
level
simply
haven't
been
able
to
compete
significantly
against
new
york.
finally,
the
commission
found
the
greater
distance
of
the
northern
tier
ports
from
the
affected
territory
and
the
higher
cost
of
service
to
and
from
those
ports
is
firmly
established.
the
cost
evidence
in
support
of
that
finding
will
be
summarized
for
the
court
by
mr.
langdon.
thus
the
problem
before
the
commission
boiled
onto
this.
nobody
wanted
to
see
both
sets
of
rate
reductions
going
to
effect,
thereby
merely
putting
the
differentials
down
to
a
lower
level,
the
dissipation
of
carrier
revenues
in
a
rate
war
just
the
kind
of
rate
war,
which
gave
rise
to
these
differentials.
so
the
real
issue
before
the
commission
was
whether
to
enforce
rate
parity
upon
all
the
railroads
servicing
the
north
atlantic
ports
or
to
maintain
the
differentials
at
the
present
level.
the
commission
concluded
that
it
would
not
enforce
a
rate
parity,
which
would
ignore
the
distance
and
cost
advantages
of
the
railroad
serving
the
southern
tier
ports,
and
at
the
same
time
result
in
an
undue
diversion
of
traffic
from
the
southern
tier
ports
to
new
york.
in
so
doing,
it
was
applied
the
accepted
principle
that
a
discrimination
which
is
produced
by
charging
equal
rates
for
unequal
service
is
prohibited
by
the
statute
just
as
much
as
one
resulting
from
unequal
rates
for
equal
service.
now
the
lower
court
set
aside
the
commission's
decision
and
i
quote
“in
so
far
as
it
prevents
differential
eliminating
rates
from
becoming
effective.”
we
think
the
court
erred
in
several
major
respects.
we
contend
that
it
erred
in
making
its
own
independent
finding,
that
on
this
evidence
the
northern
lines
certainly
have
established
prima
facie
the
reasonableness
of
their
rates.
we
think
it
further
erred
in
concluding
that
the
commission
had
based
its
decision
of
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
section
3(1)
solely
on
the
distance
advantages
of
the
northern
tier
ports.
the
court
stating
that
while
differences
in
cost
might
be
relevant,
there
were
neither
findings
nor
evidence
as
to
cost.
in
fact,
the
court
overlooked
both
the
commission's
finding
as
to
relative
cost
and
the
evidence
in
support
of
it
which
mr.
langdon
will
be
summarizing.
and
finally
we
submit
that
the
court
erred
in
holding
that
distance
was
irrelevant
to
the
port
differentials.
which
it
said,
were
established
solely
to
equalize
the
aggregate
of
rail
ocean
charges.
now
we
think
it
erred
in
holding
that
the
purpose
of
the
1935
amendment
to
section
3(1)
was
to
permit
all
ports
in
the
carrier
serving
them
to
compete
for
all
import
traffic
thereby
maximizing
the
number
of
ports
available.
turning
to
the
history
of
the
differentials,
and
the
role
which
distance
has
played
in
it.
even
prior
to
1887,
1877
baltimore
and
philadelphia
by
agreement
between
the
northern
lines
and
the
southern
lines
enjoyed
differentially
lower
rates,
sometimes
there
were
arbitrary
differentials
and
sometimes
they
were
measured
by
distance.
but
they
were
substantially
greater
than
the
differentials
fixed
in
the
1877
agreement.
they
were
so
much
greater
in
fact
that
they
became
intolerable
to
the
new
york
central
and
erie.
and
after
a
final
major
rate
war
central,
erie,
pennsylvania
and
baltimore
and
ohio
entered
into
the
famous
1877
agreement.
that
agreement
is
in
volume
four
of
the
record
at
page
1903.
it
recites
that
it
was
made
to
avoid
all
future
misunderstandings
in
respect
of
the
geographical
advantages
or
disadvantages
of
the
cities
of
baltimore,
philadelphia
and
new
york
as
effected
by
rail
and
ocean
transportation.
and
with
a
view
of
effecting
an
equalization
of
the
aggregate
cost
of
rail
and
ocean
transportation
between
all
competitive
points
in
the
west
and
all
domestic
and
foreign
ports
reached
through
above
cities.
the
agreement
further
provided
that
the
rates
to
and
from
boston
should
not
be
less
than
the
rates
to
and
from
new
york.
now
it's
the
language
of
this
1877
agreement
that's
the
foundation
of
the
argument
of
the
appellees
and
the
position
of
the
lower
court,
that
relative
distances
and
cost
had
no
part
in
the
establishment
of
the
differentials.
and
that
they
were
established
solely
to
equalize
the
total
rail,
ocean
charges,
and
that
when
the
steam
ship
rates
were
equalized
by
1935
then
there
was
no
further
justification
for
the
differential
rates.
a
careful
study
of
the
historical
materials,
which
are
set
forth
in
the
various
appellants
briefs
will
show
to
the
contrary.
i
can
give
just
two
or
three
brief
examples.
for
example,
in
1905,
the
commission
examined
the
differential
rate
structure
as
an
arbiter
at
the
request
of
the
commercial
interest
of
the
atlantic
ports.
it
found
that
if
the
equalization
of
the
combined
rail,
ocean
rate,
and
i
quote,
“where
the
proper
basis
of
making
the
differential,
the
present
differentials
are
too
high,
for
they
undoubtedly
exceed
the
difference
in
ocean
rates.”
in
our
opinion
they
always
have
from
the
very
first.
so
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
1877
agreement
included
a
compromise
of
claim
of
a
claim
of
the
southern
tier
ports,
particularly
baltimore
and
philadelphia
for
larger
differentials,
indeed
they
had
up
till
then
enjoyed
larger
differentials.
again
in
1898
the
commission
rejected
the
complaint
of
new
york
commercial
interest
that
the
lower
rates
to
baltimore
and
philadelphia
were
prejudicial
to
new
york
in
violation
of
section
3(1)
and
on
rejecting
that
complaint
the
commission
said
“we
do
think
that
in
determining
whether
is
an
undue
preference,
the
advantage
which
philadelphia
and
baltimore
possess
by
way
of
distance
should
be
considered.”
in
1925
the
commission
rejected
a
similar
complaint
from
the
commercial
interest
of
the
port
of
boston
and
again
it
said
“in
passing
upon
whether
or
not
undue
preference
and
prejudice
exist,
it
is
well
settled
that
cost
of
service
is
a
factor
which
must
be
taken
into
account.”
and
turning
to
this
particular
set
of
facts
they
said
“in
view
of
the
very
substantial
advantages
in
distance
from
differential
territory,
which
philadelphia
and
baltimore
enjoy,
as
compared
with
new
york
and
boston,
we
are
unable
to
find
that
there
is
anything
unlawful
about
the
port
differentials
in
favor
of
philadelphia
and
baltimore.”
so
again
and
again
and
again
the
relative
distances
and
costs
have
been
taken
into
account,
both
in
the
establishment
of
the
differentials
and
in
their
maintenance
from
1877
down
to
date.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
indeed,
and
in
a
real
sense
it
happened.
as
i
pointed
out
before
with
the
general
increase
in
the
level
of
rates
and
in
the
value
of
goods,
these
differentials
which
have
been
at
$0.02
and
$0.03
cents
per
100
pounds
since
1877
are
much
less
against
it
than
they
were
in
1877.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
that
problem
has
--
that's
not
a
new
problem,
the
commissioner
has
considered
in
one
context
or
another
again
and
again,
years
ago
that
commission
pointed
out
in
response
to
some
sort
of
complaint
from
the
port
of
new
york
that
much
of
it's
problems
were
the
development
of
the
south
atlantic,
the
gulf
and
the
west
coast
ports.
new
orleans
alone,
they
say
nothing
of
the
seaway,
accounts
for
a
great
deal
of
the
grain
export
traffic
which
formally
would
go
largely
to
the
north
atlantic
ports.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
all
the
time,
and
major
economic
change
is
going
on.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
commission
held
that
competition
was
not
the
sole
factor
to
be
determined
in
fixing
these
rate
relationships.
it
should
take
into
account
and
make
some
allowance
for
the
geographical
advantages,
the
cost
advantages
of
the
carriers
serving
the
southern
tier
ports,
cost
advantages
which
as
i
read
the
appellee's
briefs
are
not
challenged
in
this
court.
finally
i
shall
like
to
discuss
the
proper
construction
of
section
3(1)
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
legal
key
to
this
issue
lies
in
the
purpose
and
history
of
a
1935
amendment
to
section
3(1).
the
1935
amendment
added
the
words,
port
and
port
districts
to
the
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
port
and
port
districts.
to
the
entities
which
were
to
be
protected
from
undue
preference
and
prejudice.
that
1935
amendment
was
the
aftermath
to
this
court's
decision
in
texas
and
pacific
railroad
company,
the
united
states
in
289
us
decided
1933.
now
that
case
arose
out
of
commission
orders
issued
in
1925
and
1927
in
which
the
commission
found
that
the
maintenance
of
equalized
export
and
import
rates
to
and
from
the
ports
of
galveston
and
new
orleans
and
defined
inland
territory
on
the
other
hand,
not
withstanding
the
distance
advantages
of
galveston
was
unduly
prejudicial
to
galveston
and
unduly
preferential
to
new
orleans.
and
the
commission
prescribed
fixed
differentials
in
favor
of
galveston
in
those
situations
where
the
distances
from
the
inland
territory
to
new
orleans
exceeded
the
distances
to
galveston
by
25%.
and
i
think
a
significant
in
that
case
that
the
commission
also
found
that
the
ocean
rates
were
the
same
to
those
two
ports.
in
texas
and
pacific,
this
court
set
aside
the
commission's
order.
specifically
it
held
that
ports
were
not
included
within
the
word
--
meaning
of
the
word
locality
as
used
in
section
3(1).
and
the
chief
justice
hughes
and
justices
stone,
cardozo
and
brandeis
decided.
but
there
was
more
in
the
decision
of
the
majority
of
this
court
from
a
technical
interpretation
of
the
word
locality,
whether
or
not
locality
included
port.
rather
that
interpretation
flowed
from
the
court's
view
of
basic
legislative
purposes,
but
the
court
said
and
may
i
quote
briefly,
the
legislative
history
of
act,
now
that
we
are
talking
about
the
legislative
history
of
the
hepburn
act
as
well
as
the
original
interstate
commerce
act.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
demonstrates
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
forbid
the
equalization
of
export
or
import
rates
by
lines
serving
the
several
ports.
these
rates
it
was
said
were
not
to
be
proportioned
to
the
respective
distances
between
inland
origins
or
destinations
and
the
ports.
now,
if
the
decision
and
rational
of
the
majority
of
this
court
in
texas
and
pacific
is
the
law
of
the
land
today.
then
the
applees
have
got
a
very
good
case
against
the
application
of
section
3(1)
to
these
facts,
that
we
submit
that
it
hasn't
been
the
law
since
the
1935
amendment.
we
submit
that
the
mere
insertion
of
the
word
port
in
1935
in
section
3(1)
indicates
that
ports
like
shippers,
localities,
regions
ought
to
be
protected
from
undue
preference
and
prejudice,
even
though
this
means
inevitably
some
restriction
on
the
competitive
freedom
of
carriers.
it
also
means
that
in
determining
preference
and
prejudice
as
between
competing
ports
just
as
between
competing
regions
or
shippers
or
cities,
the
commission
is
to
apply
transportation
standards,
standard
which
admittedly
include
the
factors
of
relative
distance
and
cost.
but
there
is
more
to
what
had
been
just
--
just
the
amendment.
there
is
some
legislative
history
in
the
senate
where
essentially
this
case
was
argued.
well,
when
the
bill
is
reported
in
the
senate,
senator
huey
long
of
louisiana
tried
to
retain,
tried
to
keep
the
victory
which
new
orleans
had
won
in
this
court
in
the
texas
and
pacific
case,
and
he
tried
to
do
it
by
offering
an
amendment
and
the
amendment
would
have
read,
where
rates
and
charges
of
common
carries
to
ports
are
made
as
reductions
to
equalize
rates
to
ports
served
by
competing
carriers.
it
shall
not
be
termed
undue
preferences
or
prejudice.
well,
if
the
long
amendment
had
been
a
passed,
sort
of
a
proviso
to
section
3(1),
the
appellees
again
would
be
in
very
good
shape
here.
but
the
long
amendment
was
rejected
after
an
extensive
debate.
now
the
appellees
would
dismiss
this
in
a
footnote.
they
said
the
long
amendment
said
nothing
about
distance,
true,
in
haec
verba,
it
didn't,
but
the
entire
senate
debate
was
replete
with
discussion
as
to
whether
the
commission
should
take
into
account
relative
distance
and
cost
in
dealing
with
this
competitive
export-import
rate
matters.
for
example,
referring
to
the
bill
and
to
senator
long's
amendment,
senator
smith
pointed
out
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
new
jersey.
the
object
of
the
bill
is
to
prevent
further
discrimination
against
ports
where
they
are
more
advantageously
situated
by
a
virtue
of
their
nearness
to
the
source
of
supply.
if
this
amendment,
senator
long's
amendment
should
be
agreed
to,
we
might
just
as
well
tear
up
the
reminder
of
the
bill.
so
we
say
that
the
debate
in
the
senate
and
the
long
amendment
amounts
to
a
specific
rejection
of
the
appellee's
basic
argument
that
relative
distances
and
cost
are
irrelevant
and
that
enforced
parity
of
rates
is
the
only
answer.
briefly,
we
think
the
appellee's
case
was
argued
and
lost
in
the
senate
in
1935.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
he
was
from
maryland
–
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
senator
tydings
spoke
immediately
following
this
passage
for
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
he
agreed
with
senator
smith's
analysis
and
he
agreed
with
senators
and
that
if
the
long
amendment
was
adopted,
they
might
just
as
well
got
fiddled.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
might
just
as
well
got
fiddled.
senator
tydings
agreed
whole
heartedly
with
senator
smith.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
well,
i
am
sure
he
had
baltimore's
interest
very
much
in
mind.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
here
today?
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
very
much.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
baltimore
contends
that
under
enforced
rate
equalization
there
would
be
an
undue
diversion
of
traffic
on
baltimore
as
from
the
other
southern
tier
ports
to
the
northern
tier
ports,
particularly
new
york.
the
port
of
baltimore
is
an
active
party
to
this
case
and
i
can
assure
your
honor.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
yes
sir,
they
did.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
the
ultimate
finding
sir
is
to
reason
one
is
--
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
they
went
on
--
that's
sir,
they
went
on
the
prejudice
point
and
the
ultimate
finding.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
with
this
exception
sir
that
in
the
body
of
the
report
where
the
cost
--
subject
is
discussed
at
length,
they
came
to
the
conclusion
or
they
rather
refused
to
find
the
rates
compensatory,
this
was
the
holding
of
the
boston
court,
the
lower
court
in
the
case
acknowledged
that
the
commission
had
refused
to
find
the
rates
compensatory.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
sir,
i
would
say
that
the
burden
of
proving
the
rates
to
be
compensatory
was
on
the
new
york
railroads.
mr.
robert
w.
ginnane
no
sir
i'm
asking
this
court
only
to
reverse
the
lower
court
and
i
think
that
in
those
circumstances
the
commission
having
refused
to
find
the
rates
compensatory,
that
burden
approved
not
having
been
sustained
the
case
is
over.
thank
you.
