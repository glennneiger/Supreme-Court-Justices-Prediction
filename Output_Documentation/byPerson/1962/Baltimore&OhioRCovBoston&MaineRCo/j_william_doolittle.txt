mr.
j.
william
doolittle
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
appellees'
time
is
being
shared
among
the
government,
the
new
york
interests
and
the
boston
interests.
i
shall
state
the
government's
position
relatively
briefly
and
then
the
burden
of
the
appellees'
argument
will
be
handled
by
governor
dewey
and
mr.
bleakney.
the
united
states
finds
itself
in
essentially
intermediate
position
in
this
case.
we
agree
with
the
other
appellees
that
the
commission
failed
to
spell
out
a
rational
legal
basis
for
its
decision
and
therefore
we
agree
that
the
three
judge
district
court
properly
set
the
commission's
order
aside.
however,
we
cannot
agree
that
the
district
court
was
there
upon
warranted
in
substituting
its
own
judgment
for
that
of
the
commission
on
the
important
question
of
transportation
policy
presented
by
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
proceeding
should
have
been
and
should
now
be
remanded
to
the
commission
in
order
to
give
it
an
opportunity
to
determine
whether
in
the
light
of
the
court's
opinion
the
evidence
warrants
a
different
result
and
in
any
event
to
make
adequate
findings
in
support
of
its
conclusions.
and
we
feel
that
the
necessity
of
such
a
remand
is
particularly
clear
on
the
question
of
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
rates
in
question.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
i'm
going
to
cover
that
point
in
a
little
more
detail
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
are
not
contending
that
the
commission
must
reopen
the
record
or
anything
of
that
sort,
but
i'll
touch
upon
that
again.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
our
--
the
essence
of
our
attack
on
the
commission's
order
is
on
findings
and
the
relationship
between
findings
and
conclusion,
there
is
a
lack
of
a
rational
connection
and
that's
the
basis
on
which
we
would
ask
the
court
primarily
to
decide
the
case.
because
of
the
extremely
limited
time
available
to
the
government,
i
shall
have
to
leave
it
to
counsel
for
the
new
york
and
boston
interests
to
demonstrate
in
detail
the
reasons
why
the
district
court
was
correct
in
setting
aside
the
commission's
order.
in
the
few
minutes
available
to
me,
i
shall
focus
only
on
one
of
the
deficiencies
in
the
report
in
order
to
illustrate
why
we
think
that
a
remand
is
called
for
in
this
case,
then
i
shall
also
touch
upon
the
justness
and
reasonableness
point
and
finally
i
do
hope
to
spend
some
time
on
the
nature
of
the
remand
that
we
have
in
mind.
the
defect
in
the
commission's
case
on
which
i
should
like
to
focus
and
it
is
the
defect
on
which
the
district
court
primarily
focused
is
the
commission's
attaching
decisive
weight
to
considerations
that
it
had
largely
ignored
in
the
past,
and
indeed
that
it
indicated
were
irrelevant
to
its
conclusions,
and
that
is
the
question
of
distance
and
also
to
some
extent
costs.
now
the
appellants
in
their
briefs
and
in
their
argument
here
have
argued
very
strongly
that
in
fact
in
port
differential
cases
in
the
past
the
commission
has
given
distance
weight
whether
they
contend
the
commission
has
given
conclusive
weight
or
not
as
they
practically
did
here.
i
don't
know,
but
they
do
argue
that
the
commission
has
given
it
weight
in
the
past.
i'm
afraid
that
i
don't
have
the
time
to
debate
that
issue
in
detail,
but
we
do
think
that
the
short
answer
to
that
question
is
provided
by
the
commission's
reports
in
this
very
case.
at
page
3772
and
3773
of
the
record
in
the
commission's
initial
report
in
this
case,
the
commission
discussed
the
weight
to
be
accorded
the
distance
element,
and
i
don't
see
how
the
court
can
read
those
two
pages
without
coming
to
conclusion
that
the
commission
is
saying
in
our
decisions
in
the
past
we
have
accorded
very
little
weight
to
the
issue
--
to
the
question
of
distances,
and
one
very
important
sentence
in
the
commission's
discussion
of
this
particular
point
is
this
one
at
the
bottom
of
page
3772,
talking
about
distance
--
disadvantages
of
the
northern
tier
ports.
such
distance
disadvantages
as
they
have
are
much
less
than
the
substantial
differences
in
distance
to
and
from
some
other
ports
which
have
a
parity
or
near
parity
of
rates
including
the
canadian
ports
and
the
y
difference
which
obtain
where
the
several
south
atlantic
and
gulf
ports
are
equalized.
now,
after
the
commission
rendered
this
decision,
it
was
sent
to
the
district
--
it
went
to
the
district
court
at
the
instance
primarily
of
the
boston
carriers.
and
then
the
commission
voluntarily
reopened
it
when
it
was
contended
that
the
commission
had
not
sufficiently
distinguished
among
the
several
northern
tier
ports
in
making
its
findings.
and
in
its
opinion
on
reconsideration,
it
is
there
they
gave
conclusive
weight
at
least
as
to
boston
to
the
question
of
its
distance
disadvantages.
and
it
said,
after
discussing
the
various
relative
distances
and
this
is
on
page
3854
of
the
record.
such
great
differences
in
distance
under
the
circumstances
here
revealed
may
not
be
ignored
without
running
counter
to
the
provisions
of
section
3(1)
of
the
act.
well
we
submit
that
those
two
statements
simply
cannot
stand
in
the
same
case.
now,
the
commission
indicated
that
the
--
in
its
original
order
that
these
distances
were
minor
compared
to
the
ones
that
it
allowed
elsewhere
and
then
suddenly
they
become
so
great
that
it
could
not
ignore
them
without
running
counter
to
section
3(1)
of
the
act.
no
explanation
as
to
why
such
distances
elsewhere
could
not
run
counter
to
3(1)
of
the
act.
now,
the
same
general
problem
exists
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
do
believe
they
can
your
honor.
i'll
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
we
think
that
the
commission
should
decide
for
itself
to
what
extent
it
should
take
distances
into
account.
we
think
that,
that
is
a
proper
thing
for
the
commission
to
decide.
our
difficulty
here
is
that
the
commission
has
departed
from
its
prior
norms
of
decision.
up
to
now
it
has
at
least
led
all
of
the
parties
to
believe
that
it
wasn't
going
to
report
any
significant
weight
to
distance
and
costs
in
these
port
differential
cases.
the
theory
being
that
the
distances
they
were
really
concerned
with
are
the
distances
between
differential
territory
in
europe
and
that
it's
a
question
of
having
different
ports
available.
and
thus
that
we're
not
going
to
worry
about
the
distances
on
the
landward
part
of
that,
just
as
the
distances
on
the
seaward
part
of
it,
don't
make
a
great
deal
of
difference.
this
is
the
basic
reason
that
the
commission
explains
in
its
initial
report
as
to
why
distances
don't
make
any
great
difference.
now
the
real
problem
here
is
having
laid
that
foundation
in
the
past,
we
believe
that
the
commission
cannot
now
change
the
ground
rules
without
an
explanation.
all
we
ask
is
an
explanation.
we
believe
that
the
commission
may
alter
its
approach,
if
changing
conditions
warrant
it,
if
it
now
becomes
necessary
because
of
the
condition
of
the
railroads
in
the
country
to
give
greater
weight,
the
costs
and
distances,
we
believe
the
commission
is
entitled
to
consider
that
and
we
further
believe
that
matters
of
cost
and
distance
are
relevant
to
this
sort
of
question.
we
simply
believe
that
the
commission
if
it's
going
to
change
its
approach,
must
explain
that
it
is
doing
so
and
must
explain
why
it
is
now
appropriate
for
it
to
do
so.
and
so
along
with
the
other
appellees,
we
think
the
commission's
determination
is
to
the
relative
weight
to
be
accorded
the
issues
of
distance
and
cost
cannot
stand.
but
the
question
is
what
then?
does
that
mean
that
the
district
court
was
warranted
in
determining
what
weight
those
factors
should
be
accorded?
and
of
course
the
district
court
in
effect
decided
that
those
factors
should
be
accorded
no
weight
at
all,
for
the
reason
of
course
that
the
commission
had
in
the
past
not
accorded
them
anyway.
we
think
that
is
not
the
way
that
this
case
should
be
decided.
such
a
determination
as
this
one,
the
weight
to
be
accorded
these
important
factors
calls
for
an
informed
and
sensitive
consideration
of
a
wide
range
of
economic
and
transportation
facts
and
policies.
for
the
very
essence
we
--
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no
your
honor.
my
point
is
that
in
saying
that,
in
saying
that,
in
the
context
of
the
commission's
report,
it
was
according
that
factor
very
considerable
way.
if
you
read
the
report
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
say
it
can't
do
that
without
explaining
why
it
should
do
that
when
it
hasn't
done
so
in
the
past.
when
its
consistent
policy
in
the
past
as
described
in
its
initial
report
in
this
case
was
to
ignore
the
relative
distances
particularly
when
they
were
as
small
as
they
are
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
they
have
in
the
port
differential
area
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
not
completely
ignoring
it,
they
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
what
you
got
to
appreciate
mr.
justice
black
is
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
distant
--
relatively
long
distances,
we're
taking
about
distances
from
the
middle
west
say
to
the
north
atlantic
ports,
other
cases
of
course
involve
the
south
atlantic
ports,
the
gulf
ports.
in
situations
where
the
percentage
difference
between
the
various
ports
is
not
terribly
great
and
the
commission's
explanation
has
been
as
to
why
distance
is
not
critical
is
as
i
mentioned
to
the
chief
justice,
in
order
to
keep
the
various
ports
competitive
and
this
is
the
part
really
of
the
development
of
the
national
economy,
of
a
development
of
the
national
defense
structure,
in
order
to
keep
a
number
of
strong
ports
on
the
coast,
the
commission
will
allow
the
rates
on
the
landward
portion
of
these
import
export
journeys
to
be
the
same,
because
the
seaward
rates
are
roughly
the
same
in
order
that
traffic
will
flow
through
a
variety
of
ports
to
the
destination
and
if
distance
became
relevant,
why
would
of
course
all
of
the
traffic
would
flow
to
just
one
port,
and
they
would
be
able
to
accomplish
this
policy
of
theirs.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
we
don't
think
the
commission
has
to
take
distance
into
account,
we
don't
think
it
has
to.
and
the
question
here
is,
when
the
commission
has
not
given
it
decisive
weight
in
the
past,
when
it
is
decidedly
subordinated
it
to
other
questions,
more
particularly
the
competitive
relationships
between
the
ports,
we
say
that
the
commission
cannot
give
it
decisively
weight
as
it
did
here
without
explaining
why
a
change
is
called
for.
why
the
commission
has
now
decided
that
costs
and
distances,
which
are
by
and
large
of
the
same
problem,
why
they
have
now
become
important,
because
we
think
it's
perfectly
clear
from
the
commission's
initial
report
in
this
case
that
in
the
past
the
commission
has
not
given
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
the
question
of
distances;
import
differential
case.
i'm
not
talking
of
course
about
the
domestic
rate
case.
i'm
talking
about
the
special
category
of
cases
the
port
differential
cases.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
it's
is
consistently
said
that
distances
are
not
very
important
and
in
its
initial
report
in
this
case,
here
is
its
language
on
analysis
of
its
cases.
“it
is
apparent
that
considerable
disregard
of
rail
distances
is
characteristic
of
all
port
adjustments
as
it
was
in
the
establishment
of
the
rates
here
it
dealt
with.”
and
as
i
say
the
whole
tenure,
i
can
only
ask
the
court
to
read
the
pages
i
have
cited,
the
whole
tenure
of
its
discussion
in
the
initial
reports
was
that
it
was
not
going
pay
a
great
deal
of
attention
to
distances
and
the
only
time
that
it
did,
the
only
time
that
it
did
was
when
–
see
it
decided
the
case
on
the
initial
report
on
the
basis
of
the
competitive
advantages
largely
of
new
york,
but
then
when
it
was
required
on
reconsideration
to
separate
out
new
york
and
the
other
northern
ports
from
all
that
appears
from
the
opinion
it
concluded
that
it
couldn't
separate
boston
out
on
its
competitive
advantages,
because
it
has
none
and
therefore,
it
fell
back
on
the
distance
principle
that
it
had
never
used
before,
but
now
felt
called
upon
to
use.
and
as
we
say,
we
sincerely
believe
that
if
the
commission
feels
that
it
must
now
place
greater
weight
on
distance
in
these
port
differentials,
it's
entitled
to
do
so.
we
simply
think
that
the
parties
are
entitled
to
an
explanation
as
to
why
it
has
now
become
relevant,
because
as
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
recognize
in
the
past
that
when
an
agency
completely
changes
the
norms
of
its
decision
without
any
explanation
that
really
amounts
to
a
little
more
than
arbitrariness.
we
think,
as
i
say
that
an
explanation
is
called
for
and
that's
why
we
asked
for
a
remand.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that
is
right.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
exactly
right
your
honor
the
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that's
right
your
honor.
one
would
read
the
two
opinions
at
least
on
this
point
in
this
same
case
and
it's
hard
to
believe
that
they
were
rendered
in
the
same
case,
because
they
just
--
they
face
in
opposite
directions
on
this
issue.
but
we
don't
feel
as
i
say,
we
don't
feel
that
the
district
court
should
have
made
the
decision
as
to
what
weight
should
these
factors
be
accorded.
we
believe
that
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
thus
far
failed
to
perform
the
function
of
passing
on
these
rates
does
not
mean
that
the
question
should
go
by
default,
an
issue
as
decisive
as
this
one
in
a
case
as
important
as
this
one
should
surly
be
resolved
by
the
one
agency
qualified
to
resolve
it.
for
that
reason,
we
think
that
the
agency
shouldn't
take
the
case
back
to
resolve
this
question,
to
articulate
a
judgment
as
to
whether
to
what
extent
and
why
its
traditional
approach
to
distances
and
costs
should
be
changed.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
as
i
said
your
honor,
i've
selected
this
one
error.
we
think
it's
probably
the
most
obvious
error
in
the
commission's
opinion.
counsels
for
the
other
appellees
are
going
to
discuss
the
other
errors.
my
time
doesn't
permit
me
to
go
into
them.
we
feel
that
what
i've
said
equally
applies
to
the
other
deficiencies
in
the
report.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
we
believe
similarly
that
the
commission
attached
a
great
deal
more
weight
to
the
issue
of
cost
than
it
has
in
the
past
and
we
believe
that
there
too
an
explanation
is
called
for.
we
would
not
presume
to
say
of
what
the
commission
ought
--
what
standard
of
the
sufficiency
or
the
quality
of
evidence
as
to
costs
the
commission
ought
to
have.
we
think
that's
for
the
commission
to
decide.
we
don't
think
that
the
commission
has
finally
resolved,
certainly
its
report
does
not
reflect
a
final
resolution
on
the
question
of
costs
and
we
think
that
it
should
spell
out
its
findings
in
more
detail.
we
don't
as
i
say,
presume
as
i
mentioned
to
mr.
justice
brennan,
we
don't
presume
to
say
that
they
must
reopen
the
record
to
take
more
evidence
on
costs.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
the
same
would
be
true
with
portland
and
albany,
that
is
to
say
the
point
that
was
made
with
respect
to
new
york
namely
that
they
have
a
competitive
advantage
doesn't
apply
to
albany
or
portland
either.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
of
course
as
to
philadelphia
--
there
are
different
differences
among
the
southern
tier
ports
of
course.
and
has
been
pointed
out
already,
the
newport
news
--
the
norfolk
newport
news
ports
are
further
away
to
new
york.
the
commission
never
explained
why
that
difference
distance
could
be
ignored,
but
basically
as
to
the
other
northern
tier
ports
would
be
albany
important.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
and
this
goes
to
a
point
that
was
taken
up
to
some
extent
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
argument
on
the
relationship
between
costs
and
whether
or
not
the
rates
were
just
and
reasonable,
which
was
the
point
that
was
discussed.
we
don't
believe
the
commission
has
passed
on
the
question.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
we
don't
believe
that
the
commission
has
passed
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
rates
are
just
and
reasonable
and
whether
or
not
the
cost
evidence
is
sufficient.
it
maybe
as
has
been
suggested
that
the
commission
did
not
affirmatively
sustain
the
compensatory
character
of
the
rates,
but
it's
equally
true
that
the
commission
did
not
reject
that
the
rates
as
not
compensatory.
we
think
that
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
face
of
the
opinion
that
it
didn't
reach
the
question
of
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
rates
because
it
decided
the
case
on
the
undue
preference
and
prejudice
point.
we
think
therefore
it's
perfectly
clear
that
on
that
issue
at
least
there
must
be
a
remand
for
there
to
be
an
initial
agency
determination
as
to
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
these
rates.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
what
was
admitted?
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
i
don't
believe
that's
been
argued
and
i
don't
believe
it's
true.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that
would
be
if
the
case
is
over
your
honor,
but
the
finding
of
the
commission
on
3807
refers
only
to
the
southern
tier
carrier's
rate,
that
is
the
rates
that
were
filed
as
a
response
to
the
northern
tier
rates.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
not
to
the
northern
tier
rates,
there
has
been
no
finding
on
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
there
are
cost
evidences
as
to
both,
but
it
focuses
on
the
northern,
actually
it
focuses
more
particularly
on
new
york.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
concurring
opinion
is
rather
hard
to
explain.
we
don't
know
the
answer
frankly.
the
concurring
opinion
indicates
that
it
thinks
that
the
majority
opinion
is
passing
on
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
rates.
now,
we
think
there
is
no
ground
for
that.
there
is
nothing
discernable
in
the
majority
opinion
to
that
affect.
we
frankly
have
no
explanation
as
to
why
the
concurring
opinion,
but
say,
we
agree
with
something
that
you
said
in
the
majority
opinion
when
they
haven't
said
a
majority
opinion.
i
see
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
the
northern
tier
carriers
did
not
put
in
certain
kinds
of
evidence
that
the
southern
tier
carriers
contended
was
required
for
the
reason
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
yes,
it
related
to
their
costs;
for
the
reason
that
they
said
that
the
minimal
reduction
that
they
were
proposing,
it
was
just
too
small
to
justify
the
extensive
search
that
would
be
necessary
to
develop
this
data,
and
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
the
only
problem
your
honor
is
the
commission
did
not
so
hold.
the
commission
did
not
rule
that,
that
constituted
a
fatal
deficiency
in
the
northern
carriers
case.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
it's
not,
it's
certainly
not
to
be
said
that
the
northern
carriers
ever
suggested
that
the
question
of
costs
was
irrelevant.
they
merely
declined
to
put
in
a
certain
kind
of
evidence
on
the
ground
that
it
would
be
unduly
burdensome
for
them
to
produce
it.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no
question
about
it,
and
they
--
no
question
that
the
burden
is
on
the
northern
carriers.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
that
it
was
just
and
reasonable,
it
was
compensatory
and
that
it
was
not
unduly
preferential
and
prejudicial,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
commission
did
not
reject
it
on
that
ground.
it
did
not
say
that
they
had
failed
to
meet
their
burden
of
proof.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
again
on
that
question
your
honor,
we
would
not
presume
to
second
guess
the
commission.
the
commission
did
not
say
that
they
were
not
justified
in
doing
so
and
we
feel
that
it
must
be
left
to
the
commission
to
determine
what
amount
and
what
character
of
evidence
will
satisfy
it
on
these
points.
and
we
are
just
not
in
the
position
to
pass
judgment
on
the
northern
carriers'
decision
in
that
regard.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
as
i
understand
the
way
it
came
up
is
that
the
southern
carriers
asked
that
they
be
required,
northern
carriers
be
required
to
furnish
comprehensive
cost
evidence.
they
asked
that
the
commission
required
them
and
the
commission
decline
to
require
them
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
largely
that
it
would
be
under
that
--
it
largely
sustained
their
contention
that
it
would
be
unduly
burdensome
to
develop
such
a
vast
volume
of
evidence
in
relation
to
a
cost
differential
that
was
so
small,
to
a
rate
differential
that
was
so
small.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well
our
--
because
of
the
great
amount
of
time
that
is
already
passed
in
this
case,
we
certainly
feel
that
the
northern
carriers
are
justified
in
their
feeling
that
the
case
should
be
brought
to
conclusion
as
quickly
as
possible.
we
urge
that
any
remand
be
accomplished
as
expeditiously
as
possible
and
we
urge
just
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no,
i'm
not
your
honor.
i
think
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
well,
i
don't
believe
the
whole
procedure
needs
to
start
over
again.
i
was
about
to
say
that
we
do
not
believe,
we
in
fact,
we
think
the
commission
should
be
encouraged
if
possible
to
remedy
the
deficient
things
in
its
report
on
the
basis
of
the
present
record.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
if
the
parties
choose
to
take
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
and
if
that's
true
--
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
no
and
not
all
your
honor.
mr.
j.
william
doolittle
thank
you.
