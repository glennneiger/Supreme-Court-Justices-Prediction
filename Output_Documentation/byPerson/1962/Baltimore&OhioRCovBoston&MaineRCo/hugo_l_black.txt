justice
hugo
l.
black
port
and
port
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
where?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
noticed
that
some
of
its
[inaudible]
he
was
from
maryland.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
so,
the
controversy
in
baltimore
court,
maryland
court,
new
jersey
court,
new
orleans.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
were
the
particular
inputs
in
this
amendment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
might
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah,
it
entered
it
in
the
baltimore
court,
particularly
wasn't
it,
or
was
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
baltimore
involved
in
this
time,
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yeah.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
quoted
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
understand
your
argument,
because
what
the
commission
said
was
it
could
not
ignore
that
with
other
circumstances
but
are
you
saying
it
can
ignore
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
it
can't
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
that
the
commission
has
been
ignoring
distances
in
passing
on
whether
or
not
the
rate
is
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
ignore
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
you,
because
i
don't
see
how
they
could.
i
don't
see
why
their
statement
is
not
100%
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
still
again
in
that
each
senate
who
speaks
seems
to
state,
if
distance
becomes
relevant
then
why
isn't
distance
always
relevant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
your
sole
reason
for
wanting
it
remanded?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
true
that
the
railroads
refused
to
give
evidence
to
the
cost
on
the
grounds
of
due
diligence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
about
cost?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that,
if
the
burden
was
on
them
to
prove
that
fact
about
the
being
compensatory,
i
assume
you
would
have
to
say
that
they
had
themselves
settled
that
by
saying,
we're
going
--
not
going
to
give
any
evidence,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
agree
in
the
trial
of
lawsuit
said
they
should
not
[inaudible],
not
even
relevant
and
they
go
back
on
it
later
on.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
agree
with
that
the
burden
was
on
them
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
it
was
compensatory.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
i
just,
i
don't
quite
undisputed
it,
i
thought
that
the
statement
was
made
that
the
commissions
gave
them
an
opportunity
to
offer,
and
they
said
they
wouldn't
offer
it,
didn't
--
may
not
have
used
the
word
relevant
unimportant
to
the
issue
and
then
the
commission
said
they
didn't
have
to
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
b
to
the
appendix?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
the
white
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
go
ahead.
