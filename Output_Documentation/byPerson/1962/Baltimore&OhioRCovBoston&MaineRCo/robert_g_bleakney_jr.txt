mr.
robert
g.
bleakney,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
honorable
court.
i
speak
on
behalf
of
the
boston
&
maine
railroad,
the
new
haven
railroad,
and
the
massachusetts
port
authority
which
administers
the
port
of
boston,
and
i
will
direct
myself
principally
to
the
issues
in
this
case
as
they
relate
to
the
proposed
equalized
rates
from
and
to
the
port
of
boston.
the
three-judge
district
court
had
set
aside
an
order
of
the
commission
which
has
denied
the
boston
railroads
the
right
place
into
effect
equalized
rates
on
a
baltimore
basis,
rates
which
would
have
equalized,
those
rates
not
only
with
the
railroads
serving
baltimore,
but
the
railroad
serving
hampton
roads
and
with
the
import
canadian
route
rate
through
the
port
of
portland,
maine.
the
district
court
found
that
the
commission's
decision
was
lacking
a
rational
basis
and
it
set
it
aside.
we
submit
your
honors,
and
i
will
attempt
to
demonstrate
further
in
my
argument
that
the
district
court
was
right
both
in
its
conclusion
as
to
the
legal
errors
of
the
commission
and
in
the
type
of
remedy
that
the
district
court
chose
to
issue
in
its
judgment.
before
the
district
court
your
honors
there
were
two
reports
of
the
commission
in
this
case
and
an
order,
the
order
to
which
i've
referred
directing
us
to
cancel
our
rates.
in
its
report
the
commission
said
as
to
the
boston
railroads,
that
we
just
aren't
participating
in
this
traffic
presently
and
no
one
here
as
even
suggested
the
contrary
to
be
true.
and
excerpts
to
the
commission's
report
which
governor
dewey
called
to
your
attention
and
which
all
recognizes
as
the
evidence
in
this
case
to
the
relative
participation
of
the
carriers,
shows
that
of
export
traffic
through
the
north
atlantic
ports
from
effected
territory,
boston
railroads
are
only
handling
4.4%,
4.4%
out
of
all
the
exports
from
effected
territory
through
the
north
atlantic
ports
and
even
of
that
amount
almost
all
is
but
one
commodity,
export
grain.
other
than
export
grain,
we
share
in
one
one-tenth
of
1%
on
import
to
effected
territory,
import
traffic
to
effected
territory.
our
participation
is
equally
negligible.
all
commodities
moving
through
the
north
atlantic
ports
to
effected
territory
move
through
boston
and
over
its
railroads
only
to
the
extend
of
six-tenths
of
1%.
your
honors
the
effect
of
this
decision
of
the
commission
is
to
forever
bar
the
boston
railroads
from
participating
or
from
seeking
to
complete
in
this
traffic.
the
effect
of
this
decision
of
the
commission
is
that
so
far
as
the
port
of
boston
is
concerned,
and
so
far
as
effected
territory
is
concerned,
this
port
shall
no
longer
be
considered
one
of
the
north
atlantic
ports.
in
view
of
these
findings
that
i
have
just
mentioned
in
the
commission's
report
and
which
are
unchallenged,
one
might
well
wonder
how
the
commission
could
possibly
find
that
our
rates
would
be
unduly
prejudicial
to
the
port
of
boston.
your
honors,
an
examination
of
their
two
reports
and
they
had
two
chances
to
justify
their
conclusion,
shows
but
one
basis.
that
basis
which
governor
dewey
has
already
mentioned
was
that
because
of
the
fact
that
our
mileage
to
effected
territory
is
greater
generally
than
that
to
baltimore,
and
to
a
much
lesser
extent
greater
than
that
to
hampton
roads.
the
commission
concluded
it
may
not,
may
not
ignore
that
mileage
difference
without
running
counter
to
the
provisions
of
section
3.
i
submit
there
is
no
other
finding
in
the
commission's
report
on
rehearing
or
reconsideration
or
in
its
original
report
that
offers
any
basis
for
its
section
3(1)
conclusion
on
the
boston
rates.
governor
dewey
has
already
talked
as
has
mr.
doolittle,
about
the
completely
arbitrary
nature
of
this
complete
reliance
on
distance.
this
was
a
complete
reversal
of
all
prior
expressions
of
the
commission
in
this
regard
on
export/import
rates.
and
more
striking
i
think
is
the
fact
that
it
was
a
complete
reversal
of
its
own
discussion
of
distance
in
this
very
case,
the
discussion
which
mr.
doolittle
read
to
the
court.
for
earlier
in
its
original
report
the
commission
had
found
that
considerable
disregard
is
characteristic
of
all
port
rate
adjustments
and
it
further
said
that
this
disregard
existed
in
the
establishment
of
this,
present
adjustment
and
moreover
it
found
that
the
distance
differences
here
involved
are
far
less
than
those
regularly
ignored
elsewhere.
it
would
appear
from
the
commission's
brief
that
it
recognizes
the
absurdity
and
almost
recognizes
the
arbitrariness
of
this
sole
reliance
on
distance
and
this
one
distance
finding
particularly
as
our
rates.
at
page
44
of
the
commission's
brief,
it
now
says
that
section
3(1)
conclusion
wasn't
based
only
on
distance,
but
it
was
based
on
its
distance
finding
plus,
plus
its
finding
that
there
would
be
undue
diversion
if
the
equalized
rates
at
new
york
became
effective.
your
honors,
by
no
stretch
of
logic
could
this
finding
with
which
we
don't
agree,
and
i
think
governor
dewey
is
perfectly
correct
on
this,
but
whether
it's
correct
or
not
as
to
undue
diversion
to
new
york,
it
certainly
can't
support
a
conclusion
of
undue
prejudice
with
regard
to
the
boston
rates.
it's
also
interesting
to
note
that
in
the
commission's
brief
and
in
their
argument
this
morning,
the
commission
states
that
it
has
permitted
or
required
the
disregard
of
distance
so
as
to
enable
disadvantaged
ports
and
the
railroads
serving
them
some
opportunity
to
compete
for
export/import
traffic.
i
just
ask
the
court
to
compare
that
statement
with
what
the
commission
has
done
here
with
our
--
regard
to
our
rates
at
boston,
when
appendix
f
is
considered.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
it's
completely
impossible
to
reconcile
the
two.
actually
and
additionally
the
commission
did
make
a
finding
as
to
whether
there
would
be
undue
diversion
to
boston.
it
said
equalization
at
boston
would
not
materially
affect
the
flow
of
traffic
through
that
port
and
included
in
this
finding
were
the
other
smaller
ports
of
portland
and
albany.
your
honors,
here
the
commission
is
finding
that
equalization
will
do
us
no
good
yet
finding
that
equalization
if
permitted
to
us
would
unduly
prejudice
the
southern
tier
ports.
this
is
a
such
clear
inconsistency.
i
say
that
it
vitiates
their
whole
section
3(1)
conclusion.
there
must
be
harm
for
there
to
be
undue
prejudice
that
the
statute
proscribes.
governor
dewey
referred
to
the
grain
case
and
in
that
case,
in
his
decision
judge
mcgruder
99
federal
supplement
talked
of
the
sort
of
harm
that
is
involved
in
undue
prejudice
and
characterized
it
as
drastic
diversion.
we
have
nothing
even
approaching
that
sort
of
a
finding
here
as
to
our
rates.
we
have
a
finding
of
no
material
effect
on
the
flow
of
traffic,
if
our
rates
become
effective.
no
one
here
has
dared
to
argue
that
we'll
get
anywhere
as
near
as
drastic
amount
of
traffic
from
the
southern
tier
ports
if
our
rates
are
allowed
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
commission's
decision
to
suggest
and
as
i
point
out
actually
the
commission's
opinion
and
its
findings
are
directly
to
the
contrary.
the
united
states
has
agreed,
it
seems
to
me,
in
the
briefs
and
in
its
argument
that
the
district
court
was
right
in
finding
that
the
commission's
decision
was
without
a
rational
basis.
it
merely
disagrees
on
the
remedy.
it
says
that
the
district
court
really
should
have
sent
this
back
to
the
commission
so
that
if
they
could
have
a
third
chance
to
try
to
find
out
some
rational
basis
for
this
decision
of
theirs
ordering
the
cancellation
of
our
rates.
your
honors,
we
submit
that
such
a
remand,
such
a
third
go
around
before
the
commission
would
be
both
inequitable
and
unwarranted.
remand
is
not
an
executable
command
when
an
agency
--
agencies
ever
has
been
laid
there
and
i
don't
understand
that
the
united
states
makes
that
position
at
all.
thus
it
seems
to
us
that
the
remand
would
be
meaningless
if
only
one
result
would
come
about.
i
think
the
united
states
would
agree
that
remand
should
not
occur.
our
difference
as
i
see
it
is
merely
a
narrow
one.
it's
as
to
whether
there
could
be
any
other
result
and
now
i'm
talking
particularly
about
the
boston
rates
which
directly
concern
me.
under
section
3,
your
honors,
the
error
is
clearly
a
legal
one.
the
commission
has
said
it
may
not
ignore
our
distance
differences
without
violating
section
3
and
as
we
point
out
in
brief
in
some
line,
this
is
a
complete
departure
from
everything
past,
and
present,
and
from
its
own
original
report,
and
it
affirmed
its
findings
in
its
original
report
when
it
wrote
a
second
one.
moreover,
and
a
fortiori
if
i
may
resort
to
that
phrase,
the
commission
said,
if
we
get
priority,
we
want
to
try
sending
traffic
or
any
material
amount
of
traffic.
i
think
it's
clear
as
a
matter
of
law
that
there
should
be
no
remand
under
section
3
as
to
our
rates.
governor
dewey
has
talked
about
section
1
and
i
concur
in
his
expressions
on
what
the
commission
has
done
and
as
to
why
there
should
be
no
remand.
i'd
like
to
point
out
some
additional
factors
as
to
boston.
before
doing
so,
i
would
like
to
point
out
something
that
he
was
mentioning
as
he
closed
his
argument.
that
the
commission's
hearing
examiner
who
heard
the
evidence,
heard
the
evidence,
the
prima
facie
evidence
that
we
and
other
northern
tier
lines
put
in
and
are
in
support
of
our
rates
to
show
they
are
just
and
reasonable.
he
heard
this
attempt
at
rebuttal
that
the
southern
tier
lines
put
in
which
was
directed
as
the
commission
found
principally
to
new
york
port
cost
not
to
boston's
port
cost.
he
heard
all
of
these
things
and
he
recommended
that
the
northern
tier
rates
as
a
group
be
found
not
showing
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
the
examiner
was
treating
this
thing
as
a
group
as
did
the
commission
in
its
first
report.
the
commission
considered
all
of
the
evidence
they
had
before
their
examiners
proposed
reports
they
had
exceptions
and
other
things
and
oral
argument
of
counsel.
and
the
commission
did
not
follow
the
examiner's
recommendations
and
in
the
words
of
their
counsel
below,
they
eliminated
that
recommended
finding.
and
i
say
the
commission
was
quite
correct
in
doing
so
particularly
as
to
our
rates.
the
commission
found
that
even
on
the
southern
tier
cost
evidence
with
all
the
defects
they
saw
in
it
because
it
was
tied
to
the
higher
cost
traffic,
it
didn't
cover
the
lower
cost
volume
bulk
traffic,
even
so
the
new
york
rates
would
equal
or
exceed
out-of-pocket
costs.
commission
made
additional
cost
findings.
they
pointed
out
that
because
of
our
greater
mileage
than
the
new
york
lines,
it
cost
a
little
more
in
transporting
this
traffic
to
boston
and
to
new
york
and
this
amounted
to
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
$65
or
$70
in
cost.
and
it
made
findings
on
the
other
elements
of
cost
involved
in
this
case,
port
terminal
costs
and
my
brother
langdon
in
his
reply
brief
has
been
kind
enough
to
do
the
mathematics
for
me.
and
there
he
shows
and
this
is
all
based
on
the
commission's
own
finding
that
the
boston
carriers
have
a
cost
--
port
terminal
cost
advantage
over
the
new
york
carriers
far
exceeding
their
line
haul
disadvantage,
because
their
port
terminal
advantage
is
about
$175
a
car
or
a
net
of
over
a
$100
car.
there
is
absolutely
no
basis
on
this
record
for
an
adverse
section
1
finding
against
the
boston
railroad.
and
remand
would
be
completely
unwarranted
to
give
the
commission
another
chance
to
try
to
come
up
with
something,
which
i
say
the
united
states
really
is
only
speculating
on.
there
is
just
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
that
there
could
be
any
other
result,
the
district
court
convinced
must
have
had
this
in
mind
when
it
decided
to
set
aside
rather
than
to
remand,
and
governor
dewey's
reference
to
the
grain
cases
is
quite
appropriate.
because
there
judge
mcgruder
recognized
a
similar
situation
as
to
section
3(1)
which
the
commission
had
not
affirmatively
found
one
way
or
another
on,
but
judge
mcgruder
said
they
couldn't
have
formed
against
our
rates
under
section
3(1).
mr.
robert
g.
bleakney,
jr.
they
did
not
in
their
decision
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
they
acquired
a
counsel
--
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
g.
bleakney,
jr.
my
recollection
and
i've
read
the
transcript
fairly
recently
was
they
addressed
questions
to
some
of
the
counsel
and
argument
as
to
whether
the
section
1(5)
issue
had
been
considered
by
the
commission
and
apparently
was
satisfied
by
the
answers
to
the
question.
and
i
think
it's
significant,
your
honor,
that
none
of
those
who
participated
in
this
case,
the
southern
tier
railroads
and
port
interests
suggest
remand,
it's
the
united
states
who
wasn't
in
this
case
below
--
mr.
robert
g.
bleakney,
jr.
that's
right;
that
was
the
question.
that
was
the
nature
of
the
question
the
district
court
addressed
to
counsel
in
colloquial.
so
i
think
it's
clear
from
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
district
court
had
this
in
mind
as
the
possibility
and
recognized.
the
commission
has
dealt
with
this,
that
the
commission
made
these
findings
and
they
could
not
properly
come
to
any
other
conclusion
and
was
also
impressed
by
the
fact
that
the
commission
had
before
it
an
adverse
examiner's
recommendations
and
which
they
used
to
follow,
but
did
not
follow
it,
it's
hard
for
me
to
say
they
refused
i
suppose,
but
they
certainly
did
not
follow
it
and
the
counsel
said
they
eliminated.
i
think
the
district
court
put
all
these
things
together.
mr.
robert
g.
bleakney,
jr.
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
printed
record
before
this
court,
your
honor.
governor
dewey
has
it
in
this
brief.
it's
out
of
the
transcript
of
argument
before
the
district
court.
i
don't
believe
it's
in
this
court
records.
mr.
robert
g.
bleakney,
jr.
certainly
it's
by
me
your
honor,
i
have
never
heard
a
question.
mr.
robert
g.
bleakney,
jr.
and
i
understand
it's
in
the
record,
i
wish,
yeah.
mr.
robert
g.
bleakney,
jr.
i
am
quite
certain
this
is
basic.
certainly
it
is
my
understanding,
i'm
referred
to
page
57
of
the
appendix,
and
it
is
there
in
the
majority
opinion
mr.
justice
goldberg.
mr.
robert
g.
bleakney,
jr.
this
is
the
separate
appending
on
page
57.
mr.
robert
g.
bleakney,
jr.
i
haven't
recalled
it
myself.
mr.
robert
g.
bleakney,
jr.
your
honors,
there
are
two
issues
which
i
frankly
consider
properly
called
red
herrings
have
been
thrown
at
the
boston
rates
from
time
to
time
in
this
case
and
they
appear
again.
one
has
to
do
with
section
4
of
the
act.
we've
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
a
remand
under
section
4
in
our
brief
and
i
just
don't
feel
that
i
should
take
the
court's
time
to
go
over
that
again
except
to
point
out
that
the
fourth
section
and
need
for
fourth
section
relief
would
apply
to
only
a
few
of
the
rates
involved
here.
there
are
many
that
could
go
into
effect
without
violation
of
the
long
and
short
haul
clause.
but
there's
an
additional
fourth
section
question
raised
my
brother
langdon,
who
says
that
if
parity
is
granted
to
boston
alone
and
to
no
one
else,
why
there'd
be
fourth
section
violations
through
albany,
through
new
york
and
points
to
a
comment
to
that
effect
by
the
commission
in
the
second
report.
the
commission
said
merely
that
this
would
be
true
if
it
didn't
permit
parity
at
albany,
didn't
permit
parity
at
new
york
and
even
then
would
only
be
true
over
some
routes
which
is
quite
correct.
and
i
think
that
the
reading
of
that
second
report
affords
no
support
for
a
conclusion
that
this
comment
by
the
commission
was
the
reason
for
their
denying
us
parity
rates
at
boston
because
that
assumes
that
fourth
section
violations
through
albany,
new
york
or
even
philadelphia
supports
a
finding
or
prejudice
against
baltimore
and
hampton
roads;
this
can't
follow,
but
even
further,
the
commission
set
over
some
routes.
we
have
major
routes
that
don't
pass
through
any
of
these
other
ports,
the
main
line
of
the
boston,
the
main
railroad
to
the
west,
the
main
line
of
the
new
haven
to
the
west,
would
not
even
under
those
circumstances
involve
fourth
section
violations.
it's
also
been
suggested
your
honors
that
principally
by
the
united
states
that
perhaps
we
might
interpret
the
district
court's
judgment
as
permitting
us
to
place
into
effect
equalized
rates,
without
seeking
fourth
section
relief
in
those
places
where
it
would
otherwise
be
necessary.
it
isn't
our
position
that
the
setting
aside
by
the
district
court
of
the
adverse
fourth
section
order
is
tantamount
to
directing
an
affirmative
fourth
section
order.
we
know
that
in
those
places
where
we
need
affirmative
relief
under
that
statue,
from
the
commission,
from
the
long
and
short
haul
clause
of
section
4,
we
will
have
to
get
it.
but
this
doesn't
apply
to
all
of
our
rates
or
all
of
our
routes
and
certainly,
we
suggest
does
not
warrant
remand
of
this
whole
case
because
of
that.
we
know
we've
got
to
go
the
commission
on
fourth
section
in
some
instances
and
in
fact,
that
was
an
initial
fourth
section
application
filed
of
course.
there
is
just
one
final
comment
i'd
like
to
make
and
that
is
to
point
out
that
this
court
of
course
is
vested
in
broad
--
with
broad
equity
powers
and
i
think
in
considering
whether
the
district
court
was
right
or
regardless
of
that
what
this
court
feels
should
be
done
with
this
case,
the
equity
should
be
considered.
this
case
has
gone
on
now
as
others
have
pointed
out
for
seven
years.
for
seven
years
we've
been
denied
the
right
to
place
into
effect
our
rates
at
the
same
level
of
the
rates
of
railroads
serving
the
ports
of
baltimore
and
hampton
roads.
i
think
this
should
be
kept
in
mind
by
the
court
in
determining
the
relief
that
it
wishes
to
give.
i
believe
my
time
is
up
your
honor.
