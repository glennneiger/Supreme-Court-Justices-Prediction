mr.
jervis
langdon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
ginnane
has
talked
and
discussed
the
relationship
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
another
very
important
issue
in
this
case
and
that
has
to
deal
with
the
reasonableness
of
the
rates,
because
when
as
in
this
case,
reduced
rates
are
proposed
by
railroads,
they
have
the
burden
of
proving
them
lawful,
specifically
proving
them
first
to
be
reasonable
and
then
to
be
properly
related.
actually
the
issue
of
reasonableness
is
a
threshold
issue.
you
don't
really
reach
the
relationship
question
until
you
have
first
shown
your
rates
to
be
reasonable.
in
this
case,
the
commission
found
on
the
reasonableness,
issue
of
reasonableness
that
the
new
york
railroads
had
not
shown
their
rates
to
be
compensatory,
refused
to
find
that
the
rates
were
compensatory.
and
this
of
course,
meant
that
the
rates
could
not
be
reasonable
if
not
shown
to
be
compensatory.
the
lower
court
in
boston
made
its
own
evaluation
of
the
evidence
and
reached
a
conclusion
that
a
prima
facie
case
the
reasonableness
had
been
made.
obviously,
the
court
had
to
do
this
because
reversing
the
commissions
on
the
issue
of
relationship,
it
had
to
make
a
finding
of
reasonableness.
i
want
to
give
you
a
little
of
the
background,
because
my
argument
goes
to
the
point
that
the
new
york
railroads
did
not
sustain
the
burden
of
proving
their
rates
to
be
compensatory.
mr.
jervis
langdon
they
refused
to
find
them
compensatory
sir,
they
did
not
include
in
their
ultimate
finding
any
mention
on
reasonableness,
but
in
the
body
of
the
report
they
refused
to
find
after
considering
the
subject
that
the
rates
were
compensatory
and
in
the
dissenting
opinion,
the
majority
opinion
is
construed
as
being
that
the
new
york
railroads
failed
to
sustain
the
burden
of
proving
their
rates
to
be
compensatory.
mr.
jervis
langdon
there
is
a
finding,
but
it
does
not
amount
to
a
finding
that
the
rates
are
compensatory.
there
is
a
finding
that
the
out-of-pocket
cost
would
just
match
the
revenue
level
or
the
revenue
level
would
exceed
the
cost
by
a
very
small
margin.
but
then,
the
commission
went
on
to
point
out
that
this
cost
study
applied
to
only
part
of
the
traffic
and
to
determine
whether
the
rates
would
be
compensatory,
they
had
to
know
the
cost
which
were
not
supplied
as
to
all
of
the
traffic
that
the
rates
would
attract
and
also
the
commission
said
that,
we
have
got
to
determine
too
what
the
contribution
should
be.
they
very
clearly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
had
not
been
a
showing
that
the
rates
had
been
--
not
been
assuring
that
the
rates
were
compensatory,
refused
to
find
them
compensatory.
mr.
jervis
langdon
no,
very
definitely
not
sir.
we
think
that
the
lower
court
finding
that
a
prima
facie
case
of
reasonable,
has
been
made
should
be
reversed
and
reveal
that
not
having
proven
their
case,
because
of
the
refusal
to
supply
cost
data
that
these
new
york
railroads
indulged
in
that
they
should
--
having
made
their
bid
should
line
it
and
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed,
because
they
did
not
sustain
their
burden
to
prove
the
rates
to
be
compensatory.
mr.
jervis
langdon
they
made
no
ultimate
finding
sir,
but
as
i
said
in
the
body
of
the
report
there
is
the
very
definite
conclusion
that
these
rates
had
not
been
shown
to
be
compensatory.
now,
i
might
--
mr.
jervis
langdon
yes,
but
in
addition
to
that
sir,
you've
got
to
determine
--
someone
has
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
the
cost
must
be
covered.
there
has
to
be
a
contribution.
the
mere
fact
that
rates
are
on
the
same
level
as
the
cost
without
any
contribution
it
doesn't
necessarily
make
them
compensatory.
mr.
jervis
langdon
contribution
to
net
earning,
i
mean
after
the
cost
of
moving
the
traffic
is
taken
into
account
a
contribution
to
the
constant
expenses
those
expenses
don't
vary
with
the
traffic
and
net
earnings.
mr.
jervis
langdon
well,
any
minimum
rate
any
--
to
qualify
as
a
minimum
rates
sir,
a
reasonable
minimum
rate
it
certainly
has
to
be
shown
to
be
compensatory
to
cover
cost.
this
is
a
first
step
in
the
showing
of
the
competitive
rate
to
be
reasonable
as
to
show
that's
its
compensatory
under
the
law
that
is
now,
it's
basic,
basic
principle.
now
in
this
case
of
course
we
have
the
very
unusual
situation
in
that
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
case,
the
pennsylvania
railroads
and
the
b&o,
which
serve
new
york
along
with
these
other
railroads
undertook
cost
studies,
not
only
at
new
york,
but
at
philadelphia,
baltimore
and
the
hampton
roads
lines
showed
their
cost,
computed
their
cost
at
hampton
roads
and
those
costs
first
were
computed
on
a
full
cost
basis
and
indicated
that
at
new
york
the
ratio
of
cost
to
revenue
was
in
an
area
of
a
120
to
100.
at
baltimore,
the
revenue,
the
costs
were
only
75%
of
revenue,
philadelphia
slightly
higher,
hampton
roads,
the
cost
were
50%
of
the
revenue.
i
would
like
to
mention
hampton
road,
because
this
is
an
example
of
the
type
of
discrimination
against
which
these
equalizing
rates,
which
these
equalizing
rates
are
designed
here
according
the
new
york
interest.
the
area
of
hampton
roads
with
the
30
miles
more
of
service
than
new
york
from
differential
territory
and
a
$0.03
advantage
in
rate.
they
have
a
$0.40
per
100
pound
advantage
in
cost.
in
other
words,
on
export
traffic
moving
from
differential
territory
to
hampton
road,
the
cost
of
movement
is
$0.40
per
100
pound
or
$8.00
a
ton
less
than
moving
it
to
new
york.
moreover,
the
$0.03
differential
isn't
adequate
even
on
traffic
that
originates
on
the
chesapeake
in
ohio
and
norfolk
in
western
which
are
local
to
hampton
road
to
keep
that
traffic
to
the
local
port
that
the
chesapeake
in
ohio
and
then
norfolk
in
western
server.
80%
of
the
originated
traffic
on
the
cno,
and
nnw
from
differential
territory
moves
to
new
york
despite
the
fact
that
hampton
roads
has
a
$0.03
advantage
in
rate.
in
other
words
in
this
instance
the
differential
reflecting
a
$0.40
advantage
in
cost,
isn't
nearly
large
enough
to
get
hampton
roads
a
fair
share
of
the
traffic.
the
same
relative
situation
obtains
at
baltimore
where
we
have
a
decided
cost
advantage
over
new
york.
philadelphia
has
a
decided
advantage
over
new
york.
i
want
to
emphasize
the
situation
at
new
york,
because
at
new
york
export
import
traffic
is
handled
in
a
way
that
is
different
than
of
the
other
ports.
freight
arrives
at
the
jersey
railhead
in
new
york
and
is
unloaded
and
reloaded
in
the
lighters.
and
lighters
are
then
towed
around
the
harbor
by
tugs
and
the
freight
given
delivery
to
individual
steamships
at
the
peers
designated
and
at
the
time
they
designate.
freight
is
really
expensive
service.
all
of
the
traffic
between
differential
territory
and
new
york,
practically
all
of
the
traffic
including
grain,
between
differential
territory
in
new
york
is
handled
this
way.
this
means
that
new
york
costs
are
bound
to
be
high,
in
the
area
of
$6
to
$7
a
ton
higher
than
at
the
other
ports.
now
its
said
that
this
bulk
traffic
which
new
york
hopes
to
get
will
not
be
costly,
it
will
be
handled,
they
say
on
the
jersey
shore
and
the
lightering
service
will
be
avoided.
the
new
york
railroad
were
encouraged
to
bring
in
their
cost
of
handling
this
traffic
that
would
be
attracted
by
these
equalized
rates,
they
refused.
we
filed
a
petition
with
the
commission
and
we
asked
the
commission
to
investigate
the
cost
of
handling
traffic
at
new
york
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
cost
that
the
bno
and
the
pennsylvania
railroad
had
computed
were
in
fact
representative
and
could
be
relied
on.
the
new
york
railroads
resisted
this
petition.
they
said
that,
this
is
a
relationship
case,
the
level
of
the
rates
is
immaterial.
they
said
further
there
is
delay
involved
in
this
and
they
said
finally
that
of
course
your
costs
due
from
the
southern
ports
are
lower.
you
have
the
volume;
if
we
had
volume
we
too
could
have
lower
costs,
but
they
refused
point
blank
to
bring
in
their
cost.
the
commission
denied
the
petition
for
an
investigation
of
the
cost
of
new
york.
they
said
that
it
will
be
delaying
and
they
said
further
the
new
york
railroads
have
their
burden
of
proof,
let
them
come
forward.
and
the
new
york
railroads
--
mr.
jervis
langdon
no
sir,
there
can
be
no
dispute
on
that
point.
under
the
statute
the
new
york
and
boston
railroads
have
the
burden
of
proving
their
lower
rates
to
be
reasonable
just
as
we
have
the
burden
of
proving
our
matching
reductions
to
be
reasonable
and
related.
but
the
new
york
railroads
as
i
say,
refused
to
come
forward
and
they
spent
their
entire
time
at
the
hearings
insofar
as
this
particular
subject
was
concerned,
trying
to
tear
down
and
break
down
our
pennsylvania
b&o
cost
at
new
york,
saying
they
were
unrepresentative,
but
refusing
to
come
forward
with
their
own
cost.
in
anyway,
they
produced
not
one
single
figure
dealing
with
new
york
central
costs,
all
they
did
was
try
to
restate
our
figures
on
the
b&o
and
pennsylvania
to
show
how
much
money
we
were
making.
and
then,
there
came
at
this
point
in
the
trial
the
sort
of
a
break
that
comes
once
in
a
while,
the
president
of
the
new
york
central
railroad
publicly
admitted,
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
that
their
freight
service
to
and
from
new
york
was
conducted
at
a
staggering
annual
loss.
in
the
case
of
1957,
it
was
$10,350,000,
and
it
enhances
the,
he
said
this
loss
was
attributable
to
deliveries
to
manhattan
and
the
lighterage
service
which
enhances
the
new
york
cargo
services.
mr.
jervis
langdon
yes
sir.
it's
in
the
reply
brief
and
in
the
main
brief
sir.
i'll
find
it
and
point
it
out
on
rebuttal.
i
don't
come
to
it
right
at
the
moment,
but
it
was
a
clear
statement
made
at
that
time
in
connection
with
some
controversy
there
in
new
york
city
and
it's
in
this
record,
of
course,
it's
introduction
in
the
record
here,
it
was
resisted
very
strongly
by
the
new
york
railroads,
but
it
was
admitted
in
the
relevant
portion
of
it.
it
was
admitted
in
this
record
and
at
that
point,
there
was
no
further
explanation,
no
offer
of
cost
figures
on
the
part
of
the
new
york
central,
erie,
any
of
them.
and
the
result
is
that
when
the
commission
had
this
issue
before
it,
we
had
during
the
course
of
the
hearings
tried
to
develop
and
accept
as
much
criticism
of
our
b&o
pennsylvania
railroad
figures
as
the
new
york
central
and
other
railroads
had
offered.
we
tried
to
develop
as
accurate
cost
figures
for
our
own
traffic
as
possible
and
we
did
get
down
to
the
point
where
there
was
a
large
agreement
among
the
railroads
as
to
b&o
pennsylvania
railroad
costs.
and
there
was
an
exception
on
only
their
controversy,
remaining
controversy
on
only
one
essential
point,
and
that
was
this;
we
took
the
position,
that
at
new
york
harbor
with
this
lighterage
service,
that
this
traffic
was
chargeable
with
100%
of
the
cost
of
that
service,
that
is
full
cost
should
be
used
rather
than
as
insisted
by
the
new
york
central,
partial
cost
should
be
used.
in
the
example
of
their
approach,
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
floating
equipment
in
new
york,
the
new
york
central
would
charge
our
export/import
traffic
with
only
10%
of
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
floating
equipment.
in
other
words,
the
implications
are
that
if
traffic
doubled
in
new
york,
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
floating
equipment
would
increase
only
10%,
and
why?
they
said,
with
an
increase
in
traffic,
the
average
loading
of
these
lighters
will
increase,
and
you
won't
run
with
a
doubling
in
traffic,
you
won't
run
nearly
as
--
you
won't
double
your
lighter
miles,
you'll
only
increase
them
10%
because
of
this
increase
in
average
loading.
the
difficulty
with
that
basic
position
is
that
our
studies,
which
were
un-refuted
of
the
actual
performance
of
the
lighterage
service
in
new
york
harbor
over
a
long
period
of
time
with
ups
and
downs
in
traffic
indicated
that
as
the
traffic
went
up,
so
did
the
lighterage
miles.
as
the
traffic
went
down,
so
did
the
lighterage
miles
and
in
direct
proportion.
moreover,
the
lighters
per
tug,
know
of
the
lighters,
the
tug
comes
in
the
middle
and
he
gets
as
many
lighters
as
he
can
going
in
up
to
four
or
five
sometimes
going
in
the
same
direction.
our
studies
indicated
that
over
a
period
of
time
despite
the
ups
and
downs
in
the
lighterage
miles,
there
was
a
constant
relationship
one-and-a-half
lighters
per
tug.
this
didn't
change
with
the
ups
and
downs
in
traffic.
so
consequently,
without
demonstrated
100%
variability
of
cost
with
the
ups
and
down
in
traffic,
we
thought
and
still
think
that
this
traffic
should
be
charged
with
the
full
cost.
this
is
the
basic
difference
in
the
cost
figures.
under
our
cost
figure,
which
the
commission
did
not
accept,
110%,
the
ratio
is
cost
to
revenue
110%.
the
commission
split
the
difference
between
the
parties
and
came
out
with
an
answer
that
the
revenues
were
just
about
equal
to
the
expenses
or
made
a
vary
--
or
exceeded
them
a
very
small
margin,
but
again,
refused
to
find
that
the
rates
has
been
shown
to
be
compensatory.
now
the
lower
court
reversed
because
they
said
these
rates
are
prima
facie
reasonable,
because
there
is
only
a
small
reduction,
as
if
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
they
said,
these
rates
are
compensatory,
because
the
average
revenue
are
twice
the
average
revenues
on
average
traffic
as
a
whole,
under
this
specific
traffic.
they
also
take
into
account
that
maybe
the
expenses
are
four
times
the
average
expenses.
and
then,
they
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
commission
had
in
fact
found
these
rates
compensatory
by
finding
that
the
revenues
equaled
the
cost,
when
the
commission
very
clearly
reserved
the
right
in
order
to
determine
whether
these
rates
were
compensatory
to
have
the
cost
supplied
to
the
traffic
that
these
northern
railroads
hope
to
get
and
attract
as
a
result
of
the
rates.
now,
the
question
as
to
a
remand,
we
think
that
is
taken
included
your
honors
by
a
decision
in
the
boston
court
some
four
or
five
years
ago.
when
the
boston
court
was
asked
to
review
an
order
of
the
commission,
wherein
certain
rates
on
import
iron
ore
were
found
to
be
non-compensatory.
and
the
court
was
asked
to
consider
another
different
approach
to
the
cost
questioned.
and
the
parties
indicated
that
in
any
event
there
ought
to
be
a
remand
to
the
commission
in
order
to
consider
this
further
cost
approach.
and
this
is
what
the
court
said
and
i
think
it's
altogether
appropriate
here.
we
feel
that
the
boston
railroads
must
be
prepared
to
sink
or
swim
with
the
cost
study
they
submitted
to
the
commission
as
properly
modified,
which
we
have
no
affirmative
reason
to
believe
did
not
reflect
the
lowest
possible
cost
estimate.
to
decide
otherwise,
would
open
the
door
to
a
potentially
endless
series
of
hearings
and
appeals.
on
the
present
record,
the
boston
railroads
have
failed
to
satisfy
the
burden
of
proof
imposed
on
them
by
congress
and
the
commission's
determination
that
the
proposed
rates
from
boston
to
differential
territory
would
be
non-compensatory
was
entirely
profitable.
in
that
case,
a
remand
was
requested
and
denied
here,
no
one
expect
the
united
states
which
was
not
a
party
to
the
case
is
asking
for
a
remand.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
jervis
langdon
your
honor,
that
in
our
judgment
is
not
true.
the
question
of
distance
is
a
question
that
has
been
debated
in
these
various
export/import
cases
over
the
years.
in
certain
instances
distance
has
been
regarded,
in
other
instances
it
has
been
disregarded.
if
there
were
any
question
on
this
point,
it
seems
to
me
it
was
settled
at
the
time
the
congress
in
1935
gave
the
right
to
the
ports
to
complain
of
discrimination
under
section
3.
once
they
did
that
they
then
automatically
incorporated
the
transportation
standard
as
a
measure
for
judging
discrimination.
when
you
have
a
relationship
case,
the
unbroken
authority
is,
and
this
applies
whether
export/import
rates
are
involved
or
no,
that
the
standard
of
measurement
is
the
transportation
standard,
distance,
costs.
it
said,
and
in
certain
cases
it's
true,
that
this
standard
is
set
aside
in
the
interest
of
competition
and
that
basically
is
the
case
that
the
new
york
interests
are
making
here.
they
apparently
recognize
that
under
the
transportation
standard
lower
rates
to
the
southern
ports
are
justified,
but
they
contend
that
this
transportation
standard
from
the
point
of
view
of
distances
and
costs
would
be
set
aside
in
the
interest
of
competition.
our
answer
to
that
is,
that
if
the
transportation
standard
is
set
aside
in
the
interest
of
competition,
this
in
time
will
make
new
york
a
complete
monopoly.
i
want
to
call
your
--
invite
your
honor's
attention
to
the
appendix
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
appendix
b,
it's
the
railroad's
brief
of
january
28
and
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
to
appendix
b.
i
beg
your
pardon
sir.
mr.
jervis
langdon
if
you
start
with
page
one
of
appendix
b.
mr.
jervis
langdon
yes
sir.
mr.
jervis
langdon
it
is
the
white,
the
white
one
sir,
dated
january
28.
mr.
jervis
langdon
now
this
is
a
full
picture
of
the
traffic
as
it
moved
during
the
test
year
among
the
ports
of
new
york,
philadelphia,
baltimore
and
hampton
roads
and
differential
territory.
appendix
b
is
the
export
tonnage
and
consists
of
six
pages.
it
is
followed
by
appendix
--
seven
pages,
i
beg
you
pardon,
it
is
followed
--
sorry
there
are
nine
pages
to
that
and
it
is
followed
by
similar
appendix
on
the
import
traffic.
now,
i'd
like
to,
and
this
is
the
complete
overall
picture
of
how
this
traffic
divides
under
the
rates
as
they
exist
today.
now
you
will
notice
on
page
one,
there
is
a
whole
page
of
commodities,
new
york
gets
100%
of
it.
you
turn
over
to
the
page
two
and
half
way
down
the
page
new
york
is
still
getting
100%
of
the
traffic.
we
move
on
down
on
page
two
and
you
see
automobile
and
auto
parts,
new
york
94%
an
important
traffic,
turn
over
the
next
page
on
forwarder
traffic,
new
york
90%,
refrigerators
89%,
vehicles
60
–
86%.
right
on
down
to,
on
the
bottom
of
page
four
for
instance,
the
manufactured
iron
and
steel,
which
is
a
very
important
export
commodity,
61.1%
of
the
traffic
through
new
york,
61.1
is
compared
with
these
three
other
ports.
and
you
get
over
to
the
last
page
in
this
appendix,
which
is
page
--
a
little
hard
to
handle
here,
page
13
and
you
will
see
that
on
all
of
the
traffic,
except
agricultural
process,
new
york
gets
61%
of
the
whole.
it
is
only
on
the
agricultural
products,
the
grain,
the
oats
and
the
corn
that
baltimore
and
the
differential
ports
share
and
they
do
dominate,
and
this
record
of
course
was
closed
before
the
seaway,
they
do
dominate
in
relation
to
those
particular
commodities,
and
of
course
it's
the
tonnage
in
relation
to
grain
that
runs
up
our
total.
but
even
including
the
grain,
mr.
dewey's
figure
of
24%
of
the
tonnage
in
the
northern
ports
is
wrong,
because
he
is
assigning
to
the
southern
ports
1
million
tons
of
traffic
that
the
b&o
and
pennsylvania
railroad
handle
at
new
york,
and
when
adjustment
is
made
for
this,
the
share
of
the
northern
lines
is
improved
very
drastically.
our
position
is
that
under
this
differential,
the
northern
lines
have
got
the
bulk
of
the
general
cargo,
there
is
no
question
about
it.
on
the
bulk
traffic,
yes,
it
is
attracted
to
the
southern
ports
and
why,
because
of
the
differential.
and
if
the
differential
is
eliminated
this
is
all
we
have
to
attract
any
tonnage,
we
don't
have
the
facilities
at
new
york.
we
don't
have
the
attractiveness
of
their
special
services.
if
the
differential
disappears,
the
out
ports
which
live
on
this
bulk
traffic,
which
is
responsive
to
the
differentials
will
be
no
reason
to
stay
at
the
out
ports.
the
new
york
interest
produced
a
line
of
shippers
including
a
lot
of
grain
people
and
they
said
that
the
reason
they
were
using
the
out
ports
was
unaccounted
differential.
mr.
jervis
langdon
yes
sir
the
equalization
of
course
has
been
accomplished
around
the
country
and
part
at
least
is
the
result
of
agreement.
there
have
been
certain
contests,
but
in
important
part
there
has
been
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
railroads,
and
in
the
maintenance
of
equal
rates.
but
this
particular
instance
here,
among
the
north
atlantic
ports
there
is
absolutely
no
question
and
the
commission
actually
found
that
equalization
would
produce
undue
diversion,
an
undue
diversion
to
a
port
that
already
in
relation
to
general
cargo
completely
dominates.
the
only
thing
it
doesn't
have
is
this
boat
traffic,
and
i
remind
you
that
this
record
was
closed
before
the
seaway.
mr.
jervis
langdon
yes
sir.
mr.
jervis
langdon
governor
dewey
tells
38
million
tons.
of
course
are
these
in
your
figures
that
you
are
reporting
to
me
no.
we
have
the
overall
port
figures
which
would
include
the
tonnage
through
the
port
whether
it
might
be
the
export
traffic
originate
right
in
philadelphia
and
moved
to
the
docks
by
truck.
of
course
on
the
imports
at
philadelphia
it's
importantly
influenced
by
petroleum
products
which
are
consumed
locally
and
there
is
very
little
having
tried
to
get
some
of
it
for
our
railroad,
very
little
tonnage
moving
by
rail.
now,
the
same
is
true
with
at
boston.
boston
doesn't
get
much
differential
territory
traffic,
it's
true,
but
they
do
have
a
very
substantial
tonnage
consumed
and
originating
locally.
mr.
jervis
langdon
well,
it
might
--
no
sir.
i
answered
to
mr.
bleakney,
is
that
if
boston
has
equal
rates
with
new
york,
the
record
shows
that
new
york
will
get
the
business.
new
york
drains
all
of
new
england.
even
against
higher
rates
to
new
york
than
to
boston,
new
york
still
takes
practically
everything
from
new
england.
they
are
a
real
thrust
in
this
case.
they
came
apparent
after
the
examiner's
report
and
it
was
not
apparent
as
this
case
was
a
tried,
is
for
a
lower
rate
adjustment
than
new
york.
now,
in
order
to
do
this,
in
order
to
have
a
lower
rate
adjustment
than
new
york
and
presumably
since
albany
is
satisfied
with
the
present
commission
decision
and
isn't
appealing
and
no
problem
of
changing
albany's
rates,
the
rates
to
boston
would
be
lower
than
to
new
york
and
lower
than
to
albany.
now,
this
puts
boston
under
obligation
to
justify
a
special
case
of
discrimination,
discrimination
against
higher
rated
intermediate
ports.
now,
it's
true
that
you
can
go
to
boston
and
not
go
through
new
york
and
it's
true
that
you
can
go
to
boston
and
not
go
through
albany.
but
the
main
routes
certainly
from
our
territory
go
through
new
york
[inaudible]
services,
across
new
york
harbor
is
the
main
route
to
boston,
one
of
them.
and
from
the
west
to
--
many
important
routes
work
through
albany,
which
would
remain
under
boston's
real
point
here
higher
rated
than
boston
itself.
there
is
a
second
difficulty
with
boston's
case.
they
realize
that
it
was
a
parity
of
rates
and
probably
they
can
compete
with
new
york
for
general
cargo.
they're
after
the
bulk
traffic.
now,
the
important
bulk
traffic
that
they
are
after
is
grain.
they
themselves
in
their
own
exhibit
showed
that
grain
was
carried
to
boston
at
less
than
cost.
in
fact
the
ratio
of
cost
to
revenue
on
grain
by
their
own
exhibit
was
in
the
neighborhood
of
150%.
so
--
mr.
jervis
langdon
well,
the
record
isn't
awfully
clear
on
that.
there
are
some
generalizations
sir
that
at
new
york
some
50%
of
the
traffic
arrives
that
appears
by
truck.
of
course
we
have
a
lot
of
traffic,
rail
traffic
from
baltimore
and
nearby
points
that
go
to
new
york
and
we
can't
even
attract
it
to
baltimore,
even
though
it's
right
in
the
hinterland,
they're
right
in
the
area,
switching
district
and
it
still
goes
up
to
new
york.
the
record
is
full
of
cases
of
this
kind
and
the
rivers
we
get
in
ports
from
new
york
by
rail.
the
record
shows
a
number
of
cars
on
that.
new
york
is
so
dominant,
so
attractive
that
the
three-cent
differential
is
just
completely
inadequate.
