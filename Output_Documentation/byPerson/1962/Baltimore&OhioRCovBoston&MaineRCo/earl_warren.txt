do
you
believe
they
can
or
cannot
take
into
consideration
the
distance?
chief

to
what
extent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
any
of
these
cases,
has
it
said
that
it
will
not
give
any
attention
to
the
distances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
can
you
state
briefly
to
us
whether
what
the
position
of
the
government
is
in
regard
to
the
cost?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
the
counsel
to
say
that
the
reason
that
commission
was
no
more
or
didn't
particularize
on
cost
was
because
the
appellees
refused
to
offer
any
evidence
on
cost,
their
cost.
what
is
your
position
on
that?
chief
justice
earl

i
beg
your
pardon.

were

chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
it
goes
back
on
remand,
should
they
now
--
should
it
be
open
to
that
kind
of
testimony
or
should
it
be
decided
on
the
testimony
that's
in.

mr.

mr.
langdon,
before
you
get
to
your
argument,
would
you
mind
commenting
on
the
statement
of
the
counsel
to
the
effect
that
there
is
an
unbroken
line
of
opinions
and
decisions
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
the
effect
that
both
distance
and
costs
are
inconsequential
in
proceedings
of
this
kind?
chief

of
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
you
do
with
these
exhibits
of
the
appellee's
brief,
the
one
that
governor
dewey
cited
us
to
the
one
showing
that
he
–
then
equalization
accomplished
practically
all
over
the
country
except
in
this
area,
would
you
mind
commenting
on
that
just
a
minute?
