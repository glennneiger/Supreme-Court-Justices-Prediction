mr.
thomas
e.
dewey
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
could
address
myself
to
the
questions
which
the
court
has
been
asking,
but
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
first
cover
a
couple
of
things.
i
represent
the
appellee
railroads.
i'm
happy
at
last
to
have
an
opportunity
to
speak
for
ourselves
since
the
solicitor
general
is
here
against
us
out
of
our
time.
the
city
of
new
york,
the
state
of
new
york
and
the
port
of
new
york
authority
in
18,
i
believe
it
is,
the
interveners
have
been
kind
enough
to
waive
their
time
so
that
i
may
have
it.
and
mr.
bleakney
will
speak
on
behalf
of
the
boston
and
the
portland
carriers.
at
this
stage,
the
case
seems
to
me
to
have
become
incredibly
complex
and
utterly
unlike
the
case
as
one
of
my
learned
brethren
said
a
while
back,
utterly
unlike
the
cases
i
came
here
to
argue.
i
should
like
if
i
may
to
make
four
propositions
at
which
point
i
will
then
go
through
an
orderly
argument.
first
as
that
to
the
nature
of
the
differential;
85
years
ago,
there
were
only
four
ports
involved
in
the
transatlantic
trade
in
the
northern
half
of
the
atlantic
coast.
baltimore,
philadelphia,
new
york,
and
boston
and
as
i
look
at
the
map
will
demonstrate
that
boston
and
new
york
are
very
much
closer
to
liverpool
and
lowe
then
philadelphia
and
baltimore.
and
in
those
days
the
ocean
rates
were
higher
to
the
southern
port
because
the
ships
traveled
further
and
that
the
very
substantial
difference.
and
the
contest
for
the
trade
as
the
railroads
were
building
up
and
opening
up
to
the
west,
developed
over
who
was
going
to
get
the
business
from
the
midwest,
not
the
peripheral,
not
the
hinterland
as
it's
called
in
the
cases.
baltimore
would
have
the
maryland
traffic
and
virginia
naturally
and
philadelphia
hits
new
york
zone
and
boston
hits
new
england.
the
contest
was
therefore
over
the
midwest
business,
to
and
from
the
midwest
to
a
port
on
the
northeast
on
the
way
through
or
on
the
way
from
london,
liverpool,
lowe,
italy,
and
the
parts
of
the
world.
there
were
various
rate
wars
which
were
settled
by
an
agreement
between
the
presidents
of
the
railroads
which
served
boston,
new
york,
philadelphia,
and
baltimore
and
i
should
like
to
get
this
settled
once
in
and
for
all
in
this
case.
they
made
the
agreement
which
appears
in
the
record.
the
appellants
here
adopt
the
curious
position
that
they
would
like
to
support
the
commission's
decision,
but
it
isn't
right.
the
fact
is
that
these
rates
were
fixed
with
a
differential,
philadelphia
$0.2
less
per
100
pounds
for
goods
transported
from
the
effected
territory
in
the
midwest,
then
new
york
and
boston.
baltimore
$0.03
less
per
100
pounds
because
baltimore
was
still
closer
to
the
effected
territory
is
what
they
say.
we
say
it's
because
the
ocean
rates
were
higher,
because
it
was
further.
now
i
should
like
to
get
this
one
settled
now.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
found
in
this
case
the
--
at
record
3745
that
the
differentials
were
designed
and
their
effect
was
to
compensate
for
the
differences
in
these
ocean
rates
in
favor
of
the
northern
tier
ports.
we
got
better
rates
than
the
northern,
on
the
ocean,
so
the
southern
tier
ports
got
better
rates
on
the
rail.
thus,
the
commission
continues,
they
tended
to
produce
an
equal
total
transportation
charge
between
an
interior
point
and
the
foreign
origin
or
destination
over
all
routes
through
the
several
ports
affording
the
different
railroads
and
port's
competitive
rates.
then
i
believe
that
is
clear
and
indisputable.
this
differential
was
not
created
in
a
vacuum.
it
was
created
to
meet
a
specific
condition
of
higher
ocean
rates.
now
in
--
by
the
way
as
to
the
origin
and
since
this
deals
with
distance
and
it's
been
discussed,
i
will
divert
to
do
that
too,
the
reason.
in
this
case
the
commission
quotes
what
is
known
as
the
cooley
report.
after
the
rail
road
presidents
agreed
on
a
$0.03
and
$0.02
differential
back
in
1877,
it
got
unstuck
to
use
the
vernacular.
somebody
started
cutting
rates
again,
so
then
they
agreed
upon
a
distinguished
commission
made
up
of
men
who
had
been
or
were
united
state
senators,
members
of
the
highest
courts
of
various
states
and
one
mr.
cooley
who
later
became
the
first
president
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
which
was
created
thereafter
and
in
the
year
1882
after
these
rates
had
been
in
effect
for
five
years,
the
cooley
commission
came
down
with
a
comprehensive
report,
one
of
the
most
elegantly
written
documents
that
i
have
come
across,
and
it's
in
the
record
and
they
dealt
right
up
with
the
questions
mr.
justice
black
was
pressing,
as
to
whether
their
distance
was
controlling
factor
or
cost
or
competition.
and
they
said
and
i
quote
the
language
not
only
of
the
cooley
report,
but
of
the
commission
in
this
case
in
its
103
page
opinion,
“of
the
three
principles
referred
to
in
that
report,
mentioned
variously
by
the
parties
as
controlling
these
port
relationships,
that
is,
the
distance
principle
should
that
control,
the
cost
principle
should
that
control
and
the
competitive
principle.
the
last
name
was
found
to
be
the
true
one,
competitive,
not
only
from
the
standpoint
of
their
local
interest
but
in
the
interest
and
welfare
of
the
people
of
the
nation
as
a
whole.”
this
principle
of
competitive
opportunity
appears
to
have
been
the
norm
used
in
testing
the
soundness
of
the
differentials
from
their
inception,
not
cost,
not
distance,
but
only
competitive
opportunity
for
this
peculiar
kind
of
a
rate.
and
then
they
go
on
to
say
when
so
treated
the
atlantic
city
become
merely
so
many
points
on
so
many
through
routes
from
the
interior
of
the
country
to
the
european
ports,
and
this
is
not
as
unreasonable
as
it
sounds.
it
had
of
course
the
rational
as
they
pointed
out
in
the
cooley
commission,
that
if
one
port
had
the
best
ocean
rates,
and
all
the
ports
had
the
same
rail
road
rates,
all
the
business
from
the
entire
country
would
funnel
through
one
port
and
the
others
would
fall
into
disuse
and
this
court
would
become
a
monopoly.
so
the
reason
was
good
and
sound.
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
too
that
the
reason
is
still
prevalent
today
on
domestic
rates
between
domestic
points.
for
instance,
there
is
a
case
not
too
long
ago,
i
think
it
was
from
chicago
to
peoria,
one
railroad
had
a
certain
line
haul
between
chicago
and
peoria,
another
railroad
was
a
circuitous
route
and
had
a
much
longer
haul,
but
the
commission
said
your
rates
must
be
equalized
because
otherwise
the
one
with
the
lower
rates
will
get
all
the
business
and
that
abolishes
competition
and
without
competition
the
people
don't
get
decent
service.
so
the
theory
is
practice
in
domestic
rates,
here,
just
as
it
was
in
the
differentials.
now
the
ocean
rate
difference
being
the
cause
of
the
differentials,
how
long
did
it
last?
well
on
this
subject
i
agree
with
my
learned
friends,
the
commission
has
said
everything.
beginning
in
1898
they
had
a
long
argument
on
a
--
not
on
a
compulsory
matter,
but
on
an
arbitration
sort
of
thing.
and
the
commission
said
we
think
the
ocean
rates
are
just
about
equalized.
in
1899,
the
following
year
they
had
an
equally
long
opinion,
the
ocean
rates
are
still
widely
different
and
the
differential
is
designed
to
equalize
the
difference
in
the
ocean
rates.
in
1905,
they
had
another
long
one.
in
1912
and
1922
the
boston
case
in
1928,
in
everyone
of
those
cases
they
have
hinted
that
equalization
was
just
around
the
corner,
but
it
never
happened
until
finally,
between
1920
and
1935
the
various
classes
of
ocean
traffic
finally
got
together,
there
is
the
conference,
will
there
the
high
class
transportation
on
the
oceans
and
there
is
the
trap
streamers
and
there
the
bulk
cargo,
sometimes
owned
by
the
captain,
sometimes
owned
by
companies
they
go
where
the
business
is
without
schedule.
they
finally
got
together
to
equalize
their
rates
from
the
north
atlantic
ports
and
then
also
the
problems
of
parts
of
cargoes
were
also
finally
equalized.
so
in
this
case
this
commission
found
and
i
may
say
the
appellants
who
tried
to
argue
it
isn't
so,
would
like
to
sustain
the
opinion
and
of
course
in
this
respect
as
in
so
many
the
commission
did
a
good
job
and
they
are
right,
and
they
say,
beginning
in
the
early
1920s
and
extending
to
about
1935
the
ocean
rates
to
and
from
the
different
ports
were
equalized.
consequently
the
sum
of
the
rail
and
ocean
transportation
charges
through
the
northern
ports
became
higher
than
the
sum
of
these
charges
through
the
southern
ports.
in
other
words
it
cost
$0.03
more
to
send
a
100
pounds
of
anything
from
chicago
to
new
york
or
boston
than
it
did
to
philadelphia
or
hampton
road
and
at
that
moment
we
stared
going
downhill
and
that
i
will
demonstrate
i
believe
conclusively
in
due
course.
now
you
might
legitimately
ask
me
why
didn't
the
railroads
come
around
in
1935
and
say,
all
right,
give
us
equalized
rates
now,
we
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
depression.
nobody
was
sure
about
whether
the
ocean
equalization
would
stick
because
they
had
equalized
for
brief
periods,
so
many
times
over
60
years
that
nobody
was
sure.
so
the
northern
tier
ports
carried
this
load
of
an
extra
$0.03
bottom
of
the
depression
nobody
then
sure,
then
came
world
war
ii
during
which
the
port
of
new
york
handled
in
convoys
and
shipping
one
half
of
all
the
men
who
went
overseas
in
world
war
ii
and
one-third
of
all
the
supply
ships
of
all
the
ports
in
the
united
states.
it
is
the
greatest
port
in
the
world
as
they
hurl
at
us,
but
it
is
rapidly
going
downhill
commercially
because
we
have
a
unique
form
of
torture
called
discriminatory
rates
which
is
keeping
us
out
to
the
business,
and
i
will
demonstrate
that
in
due
course.
then
after
world
war
ii
there
was
an
effort
to
equalize
and
it
was
successful
as
to
one
item,
and
then
came
the
korean
war.
finally
in
1955
they
gathered
their
statistics
and
filed.
just
equal;
the
appellee
railroads
don't
ask
any
favors.
they
don't
ask
somebody
to
build
a
barrier
against
these
other
ports.
they
just
ask
that
they
get
fair
and
equal
treatment
and
the
commission
found
that
the
equalizing
rates
proposed
by
the
northern
tier
carriers
were
to
reestablish
the
equality
of
through
ocean
rail
charges
which
existed
prior
to
ocean
rate
equalization
in
1935.
we
just
wanted
to
get
back
even
and
that's
all
we
are
here
for,
because
the
commission
apparently
will
never
give
it
except
on
orders
of
this
court.
they
had
to
come
here
to
get
it
on
[inaudible]
grain
and
we
are
here
to
get
it
on
this.
now,
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court
to
pickup
our
blue
brief
and
look
at
exhibit
b.
it's
the
map
of
the
united
states.
in
the
center
of
this
map,
the
court
will
see
the
pink
territory
which
is
sometimes
called
the
affected
territory
and
sometimes
called
the
differential
territory.
that
is
the
territory
involved
in
this
case.
only
goods
flowing
from
and
to
the
effected
territory
through
the
ports
of
the
northeast
is
penalized
by
$0.03
per
hundred
to
the
northern
tier
ports.
now,
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
west
coast
and
you'll
see
between
the
west
coast
and
the
middle
west,
a
line
which
looks
like
the
worst
gerrymander
in
history,
i
cannot
explain
it.
i've
asked
a
number
of
people,
but
it
runs
in
a
slightly
jagged
way,
shall
we
say
through
the
middle
of
the
united
states
from
the
border
between
montana
and
north
dakota
and
el
paso.
every
shipment
of
goods
for
rail
ocean
traffic
to
go
abroad
between
the
eastern
part
of
the
united
states,
east
of
that
line
can
go
for
the
same
identical
rate
to
any
one
of
the
ports
from
san
diego
to
vancouver,
a
spread
of
1400
miles.
we
really
have
equalization
in
the
rest
of
the
united
states.
you
may
ship
goods
from
boston
or
florida
or
chicago
or
from
el
paso
and
if
you
want
to
go
from
el
paso,
you
can
ship
them
to
vancouver
for
export
for
the
same
price
as
you
can
ship
them
to
san
diego
for
export.
if
you'll
direct
your
attention
to
the
gulf
ports,
you
will
find
that
again
there
is
equalization.
to
the
south
atlantic,
again
there
is
equalization.
to
the
north
atlantic,
there
is
equalization
with
everybody
else
up
to
and
including
philadelphia,
but
this
little
bit
of
the
corner
of
the
united
states
is
left
out
and
we
came
here
to
ask
you
to
let
us
back
into
the
union.
now
if
we
look
at
exhibit
a,
the
preceding
page,
i
should
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
on
the
question
of
distance.
we
picked
chicago
because
more
goods
are
shipped
from
chicago
than
any
other
port
in
the
mid
west
in
the
effective
territory
and
as
you'll
observe,
chicago
is,
for
example,
837
miles
from
mobile.
it
is
1,257
miles
from
corpus
christi,
50%
further
away
and
the
rates
are
the
same.
from
chicago
to
mobile
or
shall
we
say
to
new
orleans
this
time,
it's
890
miles.
to
tampa,
it's
1199;
309
miles
further,
but
you
ship
for
the
exact
same
pennies
for
100
pounds,
why?
because
the
basic
principles
of
law
applicable
to
this
field
are
that
through
rates
must
be
equalized
or
all
the
business
goes
through
the
most
favorite
port.
now,
look
at
the
south
atlantic,
from
chicago
to
morehead
city,
charleston
to
savannah,
way
down
to
jacksonville,
the
rates
are
equalized.
and
i
may
say
as
to
all
of
the
gulf
and
all
of
the
south
atlantic
they
are
$0:03
under
new
york,
boston,
albany,
and
portland,
for
no
descendible
reason,
because
as
you
will
see
most
of
those
ports
are
further
from
chicago
than
new
york,
boston,
albany,
or
portland.
now
we
look
at
what
this
case
is
about.
hampton
roads;
hampton
roads
in
norfolk
are
substantially
synonymous.
from
chicago
to
hampton
roads
it's
914
miles
to
new
york
it's
890.
it's
24
miles
further
to
hampton
roads,
but
it's
$0:03
less
per
hundred
pounds
and
if
that
makes
any
sense
nobody
has
yet
been
able
to
articulate
the
sense
that
it
makes.
baltimore
is
767
miles,
new
york
is
890.
new
york
on
this
map
is
16%
further
away
and
yet
we
have
throughout
the
rest
of
the
united
states
not
only
permitted,
but
compelled
by
this
commission
since
the
decision
in
this
case,
equalization
where
the
distances
exceed
by
30%
to
40%
and
50%
and
while
i'm
on
it,
if
i
might
direct
the
court's
attention
to
a
schedule
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
if
you
will
examine
what
happens
in
the
west.
from,
tyler,
texas
to
seattle
is
2351
mile,
to
los
angeles
it's
1565
mile.
it's
50%
further
to
seattle
then
to
los
angeles,
a
50%
distance
excess,
but
the
rates
are
the
same
and
you
go
all
along
the
way
up,
you
come
to
fort
beaufort,
north
dakota
56%
further
on
up
through
this
long
column
up
to
[inaudible]
new
mexico
where
you
get
to
the
climax.
[inaudible]
is
1193
miles
further
to
seattle
then
to
los
angeles
and
the
distance
disregarded
is
a
153%
and
the
commission
held
in
this
case
that
15%
of
the
city
of
new
york
was
too
much
distance
and
we
couldn't
have
equal
rates.
i
submit
the
district
court
was
right
that
it
lacked
rational
basis
and
it
didn't
need
any
remand
to
find
out,
they
reversed.
i
said
15
this
time
having
said
16%
before,
because
the
distances
to
chicago
are
slightly
different
than
those
to
the
effective
territory,
which
is
the
real
issue
and
the
effected
territory
new
york
is
15%
further
than
is
baltimore,
30
miles
closer
than
is
norfolk.
boston,
as
you
will
note
boston
is
27
miles
further
and
they
refuse
to
give
boston
equal
rates
though
they
have
compelled
equalization
of
rates
for
tampa
since
this
case
was
decided
where
they
were
42%
further
away.
now
passing
from
the
national
pattern
and
the
national
policy
then
each
of
these
rates
has
existed
for
many
years
since
at
least
ocean
rates
were
made
the
same.
if
the
ocean
rates
absorb
the
distance
on
the
ocean
then
logically
the
railroads
absorb
the
distance
differences
at
home
and
that's
the
way
it
works
throughout
the
entire
united
states.
the
reason
it
does
is,
so
as
to
distribute
the
opportunity
to
compete
not
to
compel
where
goods
show
[inaudible].
nevertheless,
commission
canceled
our
rates.
they
did
it
on
the
holding
that
such
great
differences
in
distance
make
it
unlawful
under
section
3(1).
this
is
strictly
i
submit
a
question
of
law,
which
was
decided
correctly
by
the
district
court
and
we
should
be
deciding
the
same
by
this
court.
47
pages
out
of
150
pages
of
argument
of
the
appellants'
briefs
are
devoted
to
the
vast
15%
distance
difference
of
new
york
and
the
27
of
boston
as
the
reason
for
denying
us
a
chance
to
be
treated
like
all
the
other
ports
in
america
on
all
the
other
courts.
it's
simply
a
question
of
law.
if
there
had
been
at
least
30
decisions
on
this
subject,
there
is
a
large
body
of
law
built
up
not
only
in
the
commission
and
district
courts,
but
in
this
court
and
i
say
to
you
that
from
the
cooley
report,
which
held
that
distance
and
costs
were
not
controlling
or
even
significant
factors
in
rail
ocean
rates,
but
only
equality
of
opportunity.
every
decision
ever
made
says
that
equality
of
ocean
--
of
rail
rates
is
the
rule,
that
equality
of
through
rates
between
the
foreign
port
and
the
inland
point.
no
case,
no
final
decision
has
ever
been
entered
in
85
years
by
the
commission
or
by
any
court
holding
the
contrary.
every
final
decision
has
held
that
it
is
based
--
these
are
rates
are
based
upon
through
equality
and
on
competition.
there
--
in
the
new
york-boston
area
for
some
30
or
40
years
everybody
was
trying
to
change
them,
and
of
course
they
tried
on
every
ground.
but
they
never
succeeded
until
after
the
ocean
rates
became
equalized
and
then
there
came
a
decision
called
ex-lake
grain.
interestingly
enough
no
one
of
the
learned
gentlemen
who
have
preceded
me
have
honored
that
case
by
mentioning
its
name.
the
reason
is
that
it
is
on
all
force
with
the
case
at
bar
was
a
reversal
by
the
district
court
on
both
section
3(1)
and
1(5)
of
the
court
of
the
commission
and
was
affirmed
per
curiam
by
this
court
in
1951.
mr.
thomas
e.
dewey
well
it
got
three
names
your
honor.
it
deals
with
the
grain
that
flows
from
both
canada
and
the
far
west
or
the
middle
west
through
the
great
lakes
to
buffalo
and
oswego,
but
oswego
is
a
minor
port.
it
was
called
export
grain
from
buffalo
to
new
york
in
the
commission.
in
the
district
court
it
was
called
new
york
central
railroad
against
the
united
states
and
it
was
affirmed
by
this
court
under
the
same
name
in
342
u.s
890.
the
only
difference
of
any
importance
between
that
case
and
the
case
at
bar
is
that
buffalo
is
not
in
the
affected
territory.
it's
closer
than
the
affected
territory
and
therefore
the
case
is
a
fortiori
because
the
disregard
of
distance
is
basically
because
the
affected
territory
is
so
far
away
from
the
coast,
the
distance
differences
don't
mean
a
thing
nor
do
costs,
nor
do
terminal
costs,
about
which
we've
heard
a
lot.
judge
mcgruder
in
this
very
case
affirmed
by
this
court
speaking
for
a
three-judge
constitutional
court,
unanimous
court,
said
terminal
costs
are
of
no
significance
in
this
area.
i
think
perhaps
since
i've
started
on
it,
perhaps
i'd
better
go
ahead
and
finish
it
on
that,
on
ex-lake.
i
indicated
that
the
subject
matter
was
the
effort
by
new
york
and
boston
to
get
equalized
rates
with
philadelphia
and
baltimore.
it
was
new
york,
albany,
boston
and
portland,
the
four
northern
ports
and
there
the
penalty
was
only
$0.50
from
buffalo
to
the
coast,
but
it
cost
$0.50
per
100
pounds
more
to
transport
ex-lake
grain
from
buffalo
to
the
four
northern
ports
than
to
philadelphia
and
baltimore.
and
of
course
the
commission
denied
equalization.
the
district
court
reversed
and
it
came
to
this
court,
which
affirmed.
the
district
court
enjoined
the
proposed
rates
on
the
ground
that
they
were
not
just
and
reasonable
under
section
1(5),
but
here
the
holding
was
clear,
precise.
the
district
court
said
it
preformed
its
function,
that's
what
it
was
created
for
as
i
understand
the
law
of
correcting
the
errors
of
the
commission.
the
district
court
held
that
on
the
evidence
before
the
commission
the
rates
were
just
and
reasonable,
and
they
enjoined
it.
and
they
said
as
to
the
point
under
3(1)
whether
equal
rates
would
prejudice
baltimore
or
philadelphia,
which
is
the
very
issue
here.
they
weren't
very
clear
as
to
what
the
commission
had
held,
but
whatever
they
held,
here
are
the
facts.
it
did
not
violate
section
3(1).
they
reversed
on
both
grounds
and
joined
and
it
was
sustained
in
this
court,
i
would
like
to
say
other
courts.
the
similarities
i
should
like
to
enumerate
if
i
may.
first,
the
argument
there
just
as
the
same
as
here
over
why
the
differentials?
why
--
how
did
this
thing
originate,
this
$0.50
more
per
100
pounds
to
ship
grain
from
buffalo
to
the
new
york
and
albany
and
portland
and
boston.
same
argument,
same
decision
that
the
commission
made
in
this
case,
it
was
the
difference
in
ocean
rates
which
caused
it,
and
they
held
of
course
the
same
as
the
commission
did
here.
secondly,
they
had
the
same
old
claims
of
preference
and
prejudice.
we
can't
bail
out
equal
rates,
because
the
great
port
of
new
york
will
gobble
up
the
business,
and
that
there
would
be
a
great
diversion.
the
commission
held
that
there
would
be
a
diversion.
that
it
would,
new
york
and
boston
would
gobble
up
too
much
business
and
therefore
equal
rates
would
somehow
create
a
prejudice
and
i
might
as
well
deal
with
that
parenthetically
right
now.
after
the
rates
went
into
effect,
we
had
a
chance
to
find
out
how
good
the
commission
was
at
fortune
telling.
and
that
the
southern
railroads
filed
reduced
rates,
they
wanted
to
restore
their
$0.50
differential.
commission
examined
the
record.
all
the
so
called
calamities
that
had
been
forecast
just
as
they
are
in
this
case,
not
one
of
them
happened,
and
the
commissions
spent
about
i
think
about
40
pages
explaining
how
wrong
it
had
been
and
how
nothing
had
happened
to
cause
any
diversion
of
traffic
and
denied
the
proposed
retaliatory
rates
of
the
southern
tier
railroads,
just
as
i
am
confident
they
would
have
to
do
after
and
if
this
court
affirms
this
decision
and
these
rates
go
into
affect,
there
will
be
no
substantial
diversion
anymore
than
there
was
then,
i
would
like
some
diversion,
we
came
into
this
to
get
some
traffic.
mr.
thomas
e.
dewey
i
thought
i
so
agreed
your
honors,
that's
why
i
said
it
just
before
you
did.
[laughter]
of
course
we
came
here
to
get
some
business,
we're
nearly
busted,
and
we
got
to
have
some
business,
otherwise
there
aren't
going
to
be
any
railroads
left.
finishing
this
case
--
mr.
thomas
e.
dewey
in
any
business
your
honor,
the
fellow
who
gets
the
business,
get
the
business
somebody
else
couldn't,
but
i
might
point
out
that
we're
not
just
discriminated
against
in
the
case
of
baltimore
or
hampton
roads
and
philadelphia.
the
whole
southern
--
south
atlantic
and
the
whole
gulf
has
a
$0.03
differential
too.
we're
just
left
way
out
in
the
cold
wilderness
for
no
discernible
reason.
mr.
thomas
e.
dewey
no
sir.
it
was
decided
originally,
that
the
way
to
do
this
was
rate
--
it
was
item
by
item.
so
in
1949,
the
northern
tier
railroads
filed
rates
equalizing
with
the
southern
tier
rates,
that
$0.50,
and
that
took
a
long
time
but
they
won
and
then
they
went
into
iron
ore.
that
case
has
now
been
--
well
been
in
five
courts,
it's
been
in
the
courts,
it
celebrated
its
tenth
anniversary.
it's
in
its
second
decade,
and
the
railroads
decided
that
if
that
was
the
problem,
they'd
better
treat
them
all
at
once
and
get
rid
of
it
because
if
you
treat
them
one
by
one,
it'll
last
forever.
so
we're
dealing
here
sir
with
all
of
the
rates
other
than
iron
ore,
coal
and
ex-lake
grain
which
is
not
really
affected
territory,
buffalo
is
a
stone's
throw
from
affected
territory,
literally
it's
right
on
the
edge,
so
therefore
a
stronger
point.
in
the
ex-lake
grain
case,
they
made
the
same
claim
as
to
the
southern
tier
--
as
to
the
northern
tier
rights
to
equalize
with
the
southern.
it's
what
my
learned
friend
mr.
ginnane
calls
the
enforced
equalization.
we
just
said
the
northern
railroad
just
said,
we're
entitled
to
have
same
rates
as
the
other
fellows
and
the
court
said
yes
and
this
court
said
yes.
as
to
the
fourth
item,
they
made
a
big
fuss
about
terminal
cost,
new
york
terminal
costs
were
so
high,
much
of
my
time
that
i
used.
big
fuss
about
terminal
costs
ours
were
so
high,
of
course
our
terminal
costs
are
high.
we
handle
general
cargo,
which
pays
more
and
costs
more
and
to
make
any
point
to
that
is
beyond
me
and
the
commission
talks
about
it
at
length
and
counsel
talked
about
it
at
length,
it
isn't
relevant
either
to
3(1)
or
1(5),
it's
a
question
of
what
your
revenues
are.
our
terminal
costs
are
so
high,
because
we
have
lots
of
general
cargo,
not
nearly
enough,
but
that's
what
our
principal
business
is.
so,
in
particularly
with
reference
to
that
in
the
opinion
of
judge
magruder
speaking
for
the
unanimous
court,
it
said
that
the
--
it
was
no
significance
to
the
shippers
of
what
your
terminal
costs
were
and
it's
the
shipper's
that
accounted
too,
that
a
holding
of
undue
prejudice
on
the
basis
of
terminal
cost
was
unwarranted
and
also
that
neither
comparative
distances
nor
terminal
operations
or
of
controlling
importance.
fifth,
they
made
this
same
argument,
but
this
differential
is
long
standing,
it
has
a
long
white
beard,
it
must
be
perfect,
it
must
be
sacrosanct
and
of
course
this
court
had
held
to
contrary
several
times
and
judge
magruder's
opinion
said,
age
alone
seems
an
insufficient
reason
for
denying
a
carrier
the
right
to
change
a
differential
and
of
course
they
were
right.
they
got
the
same
threats
of
a
rate
war.
they
had
it
all
over
--
they
have
them
on
every
case,
i'm
almost
embarrassed
to
hear
people
argue
about
how
our
rates,
our
proposed
rates
are
illegal,
they
violate
something,
because
the
other
side
are
going
to
post
still
lower
rates.
well
the
legality
of
our
rates
is
not
to
be
determined
by
what
counterattacks
they
may
make
on
the
structure.
commission
is
fully
equipped
to
handle
any
rates
at
anytime
and
the
very
idea
that
they
would
stand
up
in
court
and
say,
our
rates
are
illegal
because
they
have
proposed
counterattacks
preserving
a
differential,
is
sheer
nonsense
as
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
many
times
and
i
think
twice
within
last
five
years.
same
old
argument
as
to
rate
war,
same
old
argument
as
to
distance,
and
here
the
commission,
i'm
sorry
to
say
fell
in
the
grave
error.
commission
is
the
only
one
that
i
remember,
the
only
party
to
this
litigation
that
was
brave
enough
even
to
mention
ex-lake
grain
in
its
briefs
and
not
of
course
in
his
argument,
maybe
the
others
did
but
i
don't
remember
it.
but
anyway
the
commission
says
solemnly
on
the
64
of
it's
brief
in
this
court
that
ex-lake
grain
isn't
relevant
here
because
when
the
distances
involved
were
substantially
the
same
and
the
northern
ports
have
been
getting
little
of
the
export
grain
the
distances
involved
substantially
the
same.
your
honors,
the
differences
in
the
ex-lake
grain
which
were
disregarded
both
by
the
district
court
and
in
this
court
and
should
have
been
where
as
follows.
it
was
297
miles
to
boston
and
all
this
is
on
the
face
of
the
opinion.
to
baltimore
it
was
452
miles,
that's
a
105
miles
further,
that's
a
35%
excess
of
distance
disregarded
of
course.
philadelphia
420
miles,
that's
a
124
miles
further,
41.8%
distance
excess
disregarded
of
course,
it
being
an
export
rate.
boston
475
mile,
a
178
mile
further
than
boston
--
than
albany,
59.9
mile
60%
disregarded
the
distance
of
course,
because
they
are
ocean
rates.
portland
547
miles,
248
miles
further
than
albany
a
distance
disregarded
83.5%
of
course
because
they
are
ocean
rates.
no
wonder
they
don't
want
to
talk
about
ex-lake
grain.
under
the
authority
of
ex-lake
grain
every
issue
in
this
case
has
been
decided
on
almost
identical
facts.
mr.
thomas
e.
dewey
that
was
up
too
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
dewey
there
was
a
--
the
commission
canceled
the
rates
proposed
by
the
northern
tier
carriers
because
they
were
not
just
unreasonable
under
section
1(5).
the
district
court
reviewed
the
testimony
and
the
evidence
before
the
commission
and
said
it
lacked
a
rational
basis
that
the
rates
were
prima
facie
shown
to
be
just
and
reasonable
and
they
reversed
on
that
ground.
that
was
the
ground
of
the
decision
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
dewey
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
talking
about
sir.
i
will
cover
that
whole
subject
if
i
might
in
a
minute.
i've
only
got
one
more
point
on
ex-lake
grain.
i've
indicated
before
that
they
examined
the
testimony,
found
the
rates
prima
facie
just
and
reasonable
and
they
said
we
can't
tell
whether
they
held
these
rates
were
in
violation
of
3(1),
whether
they
would
create
prejudice
or
preference,
we
can't
tell
from
that
decision.
so
we'll
[inaudible]
1(2)
which
was
their
duty
that's
what
they
created
for
not
to
keep
things
kicking
back
and
forth
like
a
tennis
ball
in
a
match.
the
issues
are
too
great
and
too
important.
so
in
this
court,
we
have
the
request
for
remand
and
they
also
had
it
in
that
one
and
there
the
appellants
were
saying,
oh,
the
district
court
took
over
the
functions
of
the
commission
and
that's
forbidden,
primary
jurisdiction,
expertise.
point
was
made
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
exactly
as
they
had
made
it
in
one
final
sentence
of
their
brief
here,
so
they
don't
argue
for
it.
but
the
united
states
asks
a
remand
here
exactly
as
they
did
there
and
as
the
chamber
of
commerce
of
philadelphia,
the
baltimore
chamber
of
commerce,
the
city
of
baltimore,
and
all
the
southern
tier
railroads,
they
ask
a
remand
in
this
court
upfront,
of
course
it
was
done,
seven
years
it's
too
long.
if
i
may
come
to
1(5),
how
much
time
i
got
left?
well,
i'll
finish
this
very
quickly
and
then
come
to
1(5)
if
i
may.
the
reason
for
this
inconsistency
in
the
commission's
decisions
is
they
couldn't
find
a
reason
to
hang
this
on.
and
the
very
idea
of
sending
it
back
to
them
to
look
for
one
is
really
a
fanciful
exercise
in
intellectual
curiosity
and
would
accomplish
absolutely
nothing
after
seven
long
years.
so
the
commission
relied,
it
had
added
a
whole
mass
of
irrelevant
evidence.
they
come
up
here
in
fact
[inaudible]
they'd
say,
look,
how
poor
we
are
--
we
southern
ports,
we're
in
bad
shape
and
look
at
the
great
big
glittering
rich
fat
port
of
new
york,
they
are
not
entitled
to
justice
and
when
mr.
justice
goldberg
said
why
are
the
rates
--
why
shouldn't
they
be
equalized
one
of
the
counsels
said,
new
york.
i
thought
new
york
was
in
the
union.
i
didn't
believe
that
it
was
basis
for
discrimination.
so
they
call
it's
the
greatest
port
in
the
world.
it's
a
sort
of
the
sinister
theme
running
the
through
the
briefs.
it
is
the
greatest
port
in
the
world,
but
is
that
a
reason
for
destroying
it?
430,000
men
work,
make
a
living,
working
on
those
docks.
and
i
think
their
jobs
are
just
as
important
as
anybody
else's
jobs
wherever
he
lives.
13
million
people
depend
in
part
on
this
thing.
this
isn't
one
port.
everybody
talks
about
like
the
port
of
new
york,
this
is
a
whole
conjures
of
ports
like
the
president
of
the
new
york
central
railroad
if
i
may
divert.
they
produced
this
earthshaking
statement
that
we
lost
$10
million
on
the
new
york
central
transporting
goods
to
new
york
their
brief
says,
that
isn't
what
he
said.
he
said
transporting
freight
to
manhattan
which
is
an
island.
it
was
--
i'm
sure
it
was
an
inadvertent
error.
in
the
reply
brief
at
page
6,
mr.
langdon,
says
that
mr.
perelman
said
because
they
lost
$10
million
carrying
freight
to
new
york,
not
so,
manhattan
is
the
port
from
his
original
brief.
of
course
they
lose
on
the
short
haul
stuff.
of
course
they
lose
on
the
domestic
stuff
that's
just
still
going
to
this
island
which
is
difficult
to
get
at,
but
the
mass
of
it
flows
down
the
other
side
of
the
hudson
river
and
not
just
to
new
york,
which
as
i
said
is
not
just
a
single
port.
the
port
of
new
york
is
a
giant
port,
just
as
important
in
some
ways
as
baltimore
and
philadelphia,
but
they
want
to
forget
about
all
of
these
other
ports
that
are
part
of
this
one.
jersey
city-hoboken,
elizabeth,
weehawken,
they
are
new
jersey's
one
of
the
famous
ports
of
the
world.
they
all
go
into
yonkers.
they
all
go
into
the
name
of
new
york.
short
answer
is,
we
have
24%
of
the
traffic
involved
in
this
lawsuit.
in
one
of
the
replied
briefs
they
had
explained
unhappily
about
the
[inaudible]
i
should
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
separate
appendix
and
solely
because
it's
easier,
easier
to
handle
than
the
record.
mr.
thomas
e.
dewey
this
is
a
little
separate
appendix
on
the
jurisdictional
appeal
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
e.
dewey
it's
so
much
easier
to
handle
than
the
big
record.
mr.
thomas
e.
dewey
and
we're
grateful
to
our
neighbors
for
having
printed
it.
if
you
examine
appendix
f,
you
will
see
the
document
which
the
commission
has
said
is
the
best
evidence
in
this
case.
appendix
f
is
at
page
83;
that's
an
appendix
to
the
first
brief
and
you
will
see
on
the
rail
transportation
of
exports
from
affected
territory
the
respondents,
that's
us,
carried
a
1,642,000
tons
and
then
in
the
one
below
the
respondents,
that's
us,
carried
391,000.
you
add
them
up
and
then
you
add
the
total,
then
you
find
that
the
appellee
railroads
in
this
case,
the
great
new
york
central,
boston
and
maine,
the
delaware
and
hudson,
the
area
[inaudible]
one
of
the
grand
trunk
new
york
[inaudible]
--
of
the
seven
northern
tier
ports,
portland,
boston,
new
york,
albany,
philadelphia,
baltimore
and
hampton
roads,
all
railroads
have
24%
of
the
business.
that's
the
issue
here.
the
barriers
have
been
built
and
maintained
so
high
we
cannot
transport
goods.
a
half
of
cent
was
enough
to
cause
a
vast
lawsuit
in
grain
and
$0.03
means
that
this
commission
has
erected
in
front
of
the
ports
which
we
severe
an
insuperable
barrier.
i
also
call
the
attention
to
the
port.
they
talked
about
our
general
cargo.
if
you
look
on
appendix
f,
you
see
the
grain.
the
southern
tier
has
83.5%
of
it.
you
see
the
bulk
ore,
they
have
98.1.
they
say
we're
so
rich
and
fat
and
all
they
do
is
print
schedules
of
selected
statistics
throughout
their
brief.
i
can
prove
anything
by
handing
you
a
schedule
of
how
many
dried
apples
and
bailing
wire
we
exported
through
this
port
of
new
york,
but
you
got
to
take
the
whole
picture.
what's
the
whole
picture?
here
it
is
on
appendix
f,
we
have
24%
of
the
business
and
the
southern
tier
ports
have
83.5%
of
the
grain
and
98.1%
of
the
bulk
ores.
and
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
whole
thing,
they
talk
about
total.
they
like
to
talk
about
totals.
they
change
the
subject
when
we
say
we
only
24%
because
of
this
discriminatory
rate.
so
if
you
will
your
honor,
two
pages
earlier
on
page
79,
look;
in
1935,
1946
and
1955,
the
figures
were
taken
off
of
these
seven
ports,
new
york
had
50%
49.7.
in
1946,
it
had
32.
in
1955,
it
had
24;
24%
of
the
business.
railroads
can't
survive
with
that
smaller
portion
of
the
relevant
traffic.
and
new
york,
they
talk
about
our
bulk
cargo,
i
shan't
take
the
time
now,
because
my
time
is
running
out,
but
appendix
d
demonstrates
dramatically
that
this
high
class,
high
cost
expensive
to
handle
high
revenue
bulk
cargo
of
which
we
have
60%
is
a
disappearing
market.
it
shows
that
in
1923
we
had
36%
of
the
u.s.
exports
and
now
we
have
23%;
imports
45%
in
those
days,
28%
now.
it's
what
one
of
the
commissioners
called
a
shrinking
market.
if
we
must
be
condemned
to
that,
we
will
be
in
bad
shape
and
they
say
we're
so
big,
we're
about
the
same
as
philadelphia
in
total
trade.
the
army
engineers'
figures
at
1703
and
5,
they
didn't
put
it
in
the
brief,
i
think
we
found
it
till
after
the
brief
was
printed.
it
will
show
the
philadelphia
and
new
york
and
baltimore
all
about
the
same.
we
handle
about
38
million
tons
in
the
test
year;
they
handle
37
in
philadelphia,
35
in
hampton
roads
and
25
in
baltimore,
that
isn't
the
issue.
the
northern
tier
ports
had
56.5
million
tons
of
business,
all
four
of
us,
they
had
98.7.
the
great,
dangerous
tiger
which
is
going
to
gobble
up
all
the
business,
i
sorrowfully
say
the
paper
tiger
and
we're
--
our
ports
are
falling
into
disuse
and
docks
are
rotting.
now
if
i
may,
i
shall
address
myself
section
1(5).
of
course
the
point
is
for
remand
on
1(5)
is
not
timely.
no
appeal
was
taken
from
the
district
court;
no
point
was
made
in
the
district
court
of
it.
commission
didn't
argue
with
the
district
court.
and
when
they
made
a
motion
for
a
stay
in
the
district
court,
they
didn't
even
mention
it.
it's
inappropriate
to
ask
this
court
to
review
a
4000
page
record
to
find
out
whether
these
rates
are
just
unreasonable.
that's
the
district
court's
job
as
i
read
the
statute
and
they
did
it,
and
what
did
they
do
it
on.
this
has
never
yet
been
mentioned
in
this
case,
but
this
is
the
case.
the
appellee
railroads
in
order
to
meet
their
obligation
under
section
1(5)
to
prove
that
these
rates
were
just
unreasonable
offered
standard
proof
accepted
by
this
court
for
three
quarters
of
the
century,
by
the
commission
since
it
was
founded.
the
standard
proof
was
as
follows.
one,
it
was
minimal
in
nature.
these
reductions
were
so
slight
that
as
was
said
by
the
district
court
they
were
trivial.
secondly,
they
offered
proof
as
to
the
revenue
which
would
be
produced
by
these
proposed
rates
on
imports,
our
rates
would
give
us
$19.5
a
ton
compared
with
$8.5
for
baltimore
and
they
say
they're
not
compensatory,
and
the
same
as
to
export.
our
rates
will
produce
twice
as
high
revenues.
of
course
we
have
a
more
expensive
cargo.
we
have
the
general
cargo.
it
costs
more
to
handle
it
in
the
port,
costs
more
to
handle
it
on
the
railroad,
but
not
that
much.
and
they're
going
to
get
up
and
say
in
reply,
“look,
we
make
so
much
money,
you
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
get
any
of
the
traffic.”
that
is
the
gist
of
their
reply
briefs.
they
are
fat
and
rich,
and
we
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
cut
our
rate
to
get
some
of
the
business,
which
i
think
it's
a
little
preposterous.
now
as
to
the
other
form,
we
showed
as
i
said
what
our
ton
mile
revenues
would
be.
those
ton
mile
revenues,
your
honors,
would
be
$2.47
for
import,
$2.32
for
export.
the
average
of
all
classes
one
railroads
in
the
united
states,
have
revenue
of
a
$1.38.
our
proposed
rates
are
not
only
just
unreasonable,
they're
just
fine.
they're
twice
as
much
as
the
whole
united
states.
they
are
twice
as
much
as
our
rates.
this
is
standard
proof
and
the
commission
has
approved
it
just
most
recently
in
flaked
milk,
tea
from
chicago,
soda
ash,
all
cited
in
the
brief,
all
recent
decisions.
this
is
the
standard
method
of
producing
proof
and
we
never
refused
to
produce
costs
as
you
hear
so
many
times.
we
refused
to
produce
something
we
haven't
got.
we
have
costs
for
hinterland
which
is
irrelevant
to
this
case
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
record
and
so,
the
new
york
central
refused
to
produce
them.
they
made
motion
to
make
a
cost
study.
they
knew
it
was
preposterous.
to
make
a
cost
study
on
this,
take
years
and
costs
millions
and
when
they
try
to
make
us
produce
the
costs
study,
the
commission
ruled,
it
would
be
costly,
time
consuming
and
not
warranted
or
if
were
found
by
the
commission
i
should
say,
and
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
have
the
time
left
they
were
found
by
the
commission
to
be
just
--
to
be
compensatory
including
4%
on
investment
which
nobody
has
mentioned
either.
the
specific
language
was
that
on
our
efforts
and
after
looking
at
all
theirs,
the
rates
would
produce
the
out
of
pocket
costs,
including
4%
on
investment
which
your
honors
would
be
a
bonanza
to
railroads
that
are
making
0.61
and
hanging
on
the
head
of
--
by
the
way
that
4%
is
after
taxes,
and
they
rejected
the
examiner's
finding
that
our
rates
were
not
just
and
reasonable,
specifically
and
they
said
so
in
the
district
court,
we
have
the
transcript.
i'm
sorry
i
hope
i
haven't
transgressed
by
getting
beyond
my
time.
