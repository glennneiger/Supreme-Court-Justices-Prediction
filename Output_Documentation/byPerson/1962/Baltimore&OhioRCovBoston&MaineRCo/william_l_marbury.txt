mr.
william
l.
marbury
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
your
honors
may
remember
from
school
days
the
old
saying
of
andrew
fletcher
of
saltoun,
that
if
he
could
write
his
country's
ballads,
he
cared
who
wrote
our
laws.
lawyers
have
a
variation
on
that,
they
say
that
if
they
can
state
the
issue
they
cannot
write
the
opinion.
if
your
honors
have
read
the
briefs
or
when
you
have
read
them
or
when
you
come
to
read
the
briefs
in
this
case
you'll
find
it
difficult
to
recognize
that
the
parties
are
talking
about
the
same
case.
you'll
find
it
difficult
to
recognize
that
the
issues
dealt
within
one
brief
are
the
issues
discussed
in
another.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
therefore
that
it
maybe
worthwhile
for
me
to
go
back
right
to
the
beginning
and
see
what
the
issue
was
before
the
commission
and
then
what
it
was
in
the
district
court.
now
what
was
before
the
commission?
here
was
a
controversy
going
back
into
1877
and
before,
between
the
north
atlantic
ports
as
to
what
the
fair
rate
relationship
was.
before
1877,
there
was
no
regulation,
the
carriers
would
come
to
an
agreement
usually
by
the
way
at
a
much
higher
differential
than
this
one.
and
then
they
get
tired
of
it
and
they
start
a
rate
war
and
they'd
fight
it
out.
and
finally
they
decided
that
they'd
like
to
have
done
with
that
and
they
adopted
an
agreement,
the
major
carriers,
fixing
what
is
essentially
the
present
rate
relationship,
there
have
been
modifications,
but
this
is
what
essentially
it
was.
now
they
said
and
i
can
only
say
to
your
honors
that
in
appendix
a
to
the
brief
of
the
maryland
port
authority,
you
will
find
a
very
careful
historical
study
of
this
matter.
i
made
it
myself,
so
i
am
bound
to
say
that
i
think
it's
fair
and
accurate.
but
at
any
rate
there
it
is
and
it
goes
back
into
this
subject
and
i
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
this
was
a
compromise,
that
it
was
not
intended
--
was
not
based
on
any
fixed
principle
that
it
was
not
intended
merely
to
equalize
ocean
rates,
that
it
was
not
intended
to
merely
to
recognize
distance
differences,
that
it
was
an
essentially
a
comprise
to
stop
a
rate
war.
it
has
been
so
recognized
over
the
years
by
the
commission.
they
have
repeatedly
in
sustaining
it
against
the
fact,
said
that
it
was
not
to
be
tested
by
any
single
criteria.
it
was
not
to
be
tested
by
the
ocean
rates.
incidentally,
some
of
them
were
equalized
before
1908.
and
yet
the
commission
maintained
the
rate
relationship
against
attack
--
under
attack.
a
great
many
of
them
had
been
equalized
by
the
time
the
boston
case
came
before
the
commission
in
95
icc.
in
fact,
the
commission
then
said
they
couldn't
see
that
that
there
was
any
advantage
to
the
northern
tier
ports
and
yet
they
sustained
it.
so
i
can't
take
the
time
here
to
go
in
detail
in
to
the
history.
i
simply
ask
your
honors
to
read
the
appendix
a
to
the
maryland
port
authority's
brief,
i
think
it's
an
adequate
answer
to
an
argument
which
is
plausible,
but
on
top.
now
what
then
was
the
issue?
here
you
have
the
northern
tier
ports
boston,
albany
and
new
york
and
a
very
reluctant
portland.
actually
portland
is
very
unhappy
about
this
thing,
it
comes
in
and
says
that
they're
against
it,
but
--
a
very
unhappy
portland
tagging
along
because
they
have
to,
saying
we
want
to
abolish
this
differential
that's
been
enforced
now
for
90
years
or
more
than
85
years.
but
on
the
other
hand,
you
have
the
carriers
that
serve
baltimore
and
philadelphia
and
hampton
roads,
saying
we'll
fight
this
to
the
limit,
no
sir.
you
can't
do
it
to
us
and
they
are
backed
up
by
their
port
interests.
now
that's
what
the
commission
had
before
it,
it
had
rate
reductions
intended
to
equalize
no
other
purpose,
they
didn't
want
them
unless
they
were
going
to
achieve
parity.
and
they
had
on
the
other
hand
matching
reductions
intended
to
prevent
equalization
and
protect
the
differential.
so
they
were
faced
with
a
rate
war,
there
wasn't
any
question
about
it.
the
rate
war
had
begun
at
the
early
stages,
but
there
it
was
your
attack
on
some
tier
had
been
met
by
the
call
for
volunteers
and
they
were
off
to
the
races.
now
what
was
the
commission
going
to
do
under
those
circumstances,
what
should
they
do?
well,
there
were
certain
interesting
features
about
this
situation.
one
was
that
the
distance
in
the
case
of
baltimore
and
philadelphia,
the
distance
advantage
you'll
have
to
look
at
a
map,
it's
very
substantial,
as
to
new
york
and
of
course
much
more
so
as
to
boston
and
portland
and
albany.
mr.
william
l.
marbury
yes
sir,
well
that's
all
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
william
l.
marbury
now
not
as
to
hampton
roads,
there
was
–
there
they
had
as
to
new
york,
actually
new
york
is
30
miles
nearer
on
the
average
than
hampton
roads,
but
there
was
a
cost
difference.
it
was
a
cost
difference
which
was
never
denied.
as
a
matter
of
fact
your
honor,
i
think
it's
important
enough
to
justify
my
--
i
wanted
to
read
my
section
1,
here
it
is,
here
it
is.
actually
the
cost
difference
is
admitted
in
an
answer
to
the
petition
which
mr.
langdon
has
told
you
about,
where
they
were
trying
to
get
the
new
york
people
to
disclose
their
costs
and
have
an
investigation
made
to
the
terminal
costs
of
new
york.
the
new
york
appellee
railroads
came
in
and
said,
we
admit
we
have
higher
costs
in
the
southern
tier
ports,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
and
they
never
have
denied
it,
they
didn't
deny
it
in
the
district
court,
they
don't
deny
it
here.
there
isn't
any
question
about
it,
that
the
carriers
that
served
hampton
roads
and
baltimore
and
philadelphia
have
lower
costs
and
much
lower
cost,
than
the
carriers
that
served
boston
and
new
york.
not
only
is
it
admitted,
the
only
testimony
in
the
record,
the
witness
hay,
the
witness
of
paterson,
the
witness
of
warren,
all
these
things
are
referred
to
in
the
briefs
and
reply
briefs
of
my
brother
langdon
and
he
has
got
it
all
out
there,
there
isn't
any
question
about
it.
there
is
established,
firmly
established,
as
those
are
the
words
the
commission
used,
the
lower
cost.
now,
so
we
have
a
rate
war
and
we
have
the
fellows
who
are
trying
to
defend
the
deferential
with
a
lower
cost.
and
what's
going
to
happen
if
that
rate
war
goes
on?
you
are
going
to
have
the
deferential
reestablished
to
a
lower
level
and
you've
got
a
bunch
of
carriers
who
were
broke
or
about
to
go
broke
or
in
a
bad
situation.
there
is
no
question
about
it
that
everybody
agrees
to
that.
my
brothers
on
the
other
side
wail
about
their
financial
condition
just
as
loudly
as
baltimore
to
ohio
and
the
pennsylvania
wail
about
theirs
and
with
justice.
now,
so
what's
the
commission
to
do,
is
it
to
sit
back
and
say
well
“let
the
devil
take
the
hindmost
and
let
them
fight
it
out.”
or
are
they
to
take
a
look
at
this
situation
and
exercise
their
powers
under
the
act
to
prevent
this
senseless
waste
of
carrier
revenue
and
to
determine
what
the
proper
relationship
is
in
prescribing.
now
they
can
do
that
in
either
one
or
two
ways.
they
could
let
these
rates
go
into
effect
that
the
northern
carriers
have
proposed
and
say
to
the
southern
carriers
you
can't
file
yours.
and
that's
imposing
an
enforced
parity
on
the
southern
carrier
and
that's
what
they
were
asked
to
do
by
these
appellees
here
before
the
commission,
that's
what
they
asked
them
to
do.
or
they
can
do
what
they
did
do,
and
that
is
to
say,
“no
sir,
we
are
going
to
cancel
all
these
rates
and
that
in
effect
means
that
you
have
got
to
maintain
the
existing
differential.”
that's
what
they
did
do.
now
why
did
they
do
it?
why
did
they
do
it?
well,
in
the
first
place,
they
had
a
look
at
these
differentials
to
see
how
they
operated,
the
contention
was
made
not
only
that
this
was
an
obsolescent
historical
survival
from
the
19th
century
for
which
there
was
no
longer
any
justification,
but
the
contention
was
made
that
they
were
operating
in
such
a
way
as
to
penalize
the
northern
carriers
in
the
ports
that
they
served.
and
so,
the
commission
took
a
very
careful
look
at
that
as
page
after
page
with
careful,
scrupulous
analysis
of
the
evidence.
and
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that,
that
was
not
true,
that
new
york
had
not
made
out
its
--
or
let
me
put
it
this
way,
that
new
york
had
not
made
out
its
case
nor
had
any
of
the
northern
carriers
in
that
respect.
now
it
is
true
that
there
are
some
--
if
you
take
mere
tonnages
that
because
the
lower
carriers
have
specialized
in
bulk
facilities
and
your
honor
please
what
else
were
they
to
do?
new
york
has
an
overwhelming
advantage
when
it
comes
to
the
vast
mass
of
general
cargo,
which
is
the
high
rated,
high
value
cargo.
if
you
want
to
know
what
general
cargo
is;
have
a
look
at
the
exhibit
attached
to
mr.
langdon's
original
brief,
and
you
will
see
there
lists
of
hundreds
of
items,
which
move
100%
through
new
york
or
98%
through
new
york
at
the
general
cargo.
and
it's
everything
from
steel
presses
that
would
fill
half
of
this
court
room
down
to
cigarettes.
i
mean,
you
have
new
york
today
with
an
overwhelming
dominance
in
the
field
of
the
high
rated,
high
value
cargo.
you
have
these
out
ports
clinging
on
and
they
have
been
clinging
on
and
this
has
been
going
on
from
the
beginning
by
specializing
in
facilities
and
in
the
handling
of
bulk
cargoes.
now
what
happened
was
that
a
lot
of
ore
began
to
be
imported
after
world
war
ii,
some
of
it
before
that,
but
a
great
deal
of
it
after
world
war
ii
and
it
has
changed
the
tonnage
figures
and
there
got
to
be
a
good
deal
of
grain
going
to
europe
right
after
the
war
and
that
changed
tonnage
figures.
these
tonnage
figures
are
subject
to
a
rapid
fluctuation
your
honors.
and
as
everybody
knows,
seaway
is
a
tremendous
competitor
when
it
comes
to
this
bulk
business
and
primarily
competes
with
the
ports
that
live
on
the
bulk
business.
this
is
what
the
commission
found
when
they
looked
at
it.
now,
i
haven't
got
the
time
here
to
go
into
an
analysis
of
the
commission's
opinions.
i
have
tried
to
make
it
in
the
brief,
which
i
prepared
here
on
behalf
of
the
maryland
port
authority.
i
think
you
will
find
that,
that
the
commission
met
head-on
the
arguments
that
were
made
as
to
unfairness
that
this
thing
was
operating
in
such
a
way
as
to
give
an
unreasonable
advantage
to
the
southern
tier
ports,
to
baltimore
and
philadelphia
and
new
york.
i
think
they
meant
that
argument
and
i
think
that
at
any
rate
they
meant
it
in
such
a
way
that
i'm
sure
that
your
honors
will
not
want
to
go
in
to
it
and
try
to
say
that
they
were
wrong,
it's
supported
by
all
sort
of
subsidiary
findings
and
everything
of
that
sort.
all
right,
so
then
and
incidentally
they,
so
they
found
that
the
thing
in
practice
was
operating
in
a
way
that
was
not
unfair,
they
found
that
the
southern
ports
had
developed
their
economies
largely
on
the
basis
of
this
differential,
they
found
that
without
the
differential,
new
york
would
have
a
monopoly
of
the
general
cargo
business
and
would
divert
a
great
deal
of
the
bulk
business
as
well.
they
found
that
there
would
be
undue
diversion,
that's
what
they
called
undue
diversion
to
new
york
and
they
came
to
the
concussion
that
under
those
circumstances
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
letting
the
differential
stand
if
it
was,
now,
all
right.
but
the
question
is,
what
are
you
going
to
base,
how
you
are
going
to
proceed,
how
you
are
going
to
act?
well,
obviously
they
couldn't
say
that
the
existing
differential
was
unlawful.
there
is
no
basis
for
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact
my
brother
argued
that.
they
go
right
up
to
it
and
a
great
deal
of
everything
saying
about
how
awful
this
is,
but
then
they
say
if,
if
there
is
any
prejudice,
it
was
against
the
northern
ports.
and
they
said
these
case
differs
from
the
cases
which
the
commission
has
decided
over
the
years
where
they
held
there
was
no
prejudice
in
the
existing
differential,
it
differs,
but
they
say,
this
is
all
immaterial,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
this
–
they
say
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they,
southern
ports
have
a
geographical
advantage,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
they
have
a
cost
advantage,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
their
traffic
is
going
to
be
diverted
to
new
york,
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
existing
rate
is
not
unlawful,
none
of
those
things
matter,
according
to
their
theory
of
the
case.
the
only
thing
that
matters
is,
that
the
northern
railroads
would
like
to
carry
more
bulk
business
and
they
think
that
in
order
to
do
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
lower
their
rates.
now
that
is
in
essence
what
they
argued.
now
the
commission
first
place
had
to
look
at
this
question
of
what
the
northern,
at
these
rates
to
see
whether
or
not
actually
this
undue
diversion
which
they
had
found
and
on
found
on
--
certainly
on
a
reasonable
basis,
does
it
matter,
does
it
matter
that
the
effect
of
these
rates,
if
they
are
permitted
to
go
into
effect
and
the
southern
carriers
are
not
allowed
to
do
it.
in
other
words,
an
enforced
parity,
does
it
matter
then
that
would
be
disregarding
a
geographical
advantage,
that
it
would
be
disregarding
a
cost
advantage,
that
it
would
be
disregarding
the
fact
that
under
parity,
the
southern
court
would
lose
the
traffic,
the
general
traffic
that
they
now
have
and
allow
their
bulk
traffic
and
would
simply
be
in
no
position
to
compete
it
all,
do
those
things
matter?
well
the
commission
thought
they
didn't
matter,
the
commission
thought
they
are
matter
to
the
extent
of
justifying
or
finding
under
section
3,
that
there
would
be
undo
prejudice.
now
mr.
ginnane
in
his
brief
and
in
his
argument
has
pointed
out
to
you
that
when
the
statute
was
amended
in
1935,
the
commission
was
given
the
power
to
do
exactly
that,
to
waive
these
factors
and
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
and
i
think
he
has
shown
this
conclusively
and
this
argument,
these
things
don't
matter
that
the
railroads
can
compete
and
are
free
to
compete
regardless.
i
think
it's
fully
answered
in
his
brief,
but
i
would
like
to
call
your
attention
to
another
aspect
of
the
matter
anyhow.
suppose
that
you
don't
go
so
far
and
defined
prejudice,
was
it
necessary
for
the
commission
to
find
that
these
rates
are
prejudicial,
was
it
necessary?
well
actually
the
solicitor
general,
if
i
understand
his
brief,
it
says,
admits
that
it
wasn't,
that
even
though
there
was
no
finding
under
section
3(i)
that
the
commission
would
have
had
the
power
in
order
to
prevent
sensed
dissipation
of
carrier
revenue
by
a
rate
war
that
could
have
only
resulted
in
restoring
the
differential
at
the
same
level
that
they
would
have
had
the
power
to
prevent
that,
exercise
their
powers
under
section
15
to
prescribe
the
maintenance
of
the
existing
differentials,
that's
the
way
what
i
understand
he
says.
my
brother
is
representing
the
railroads
dispute
there,
they
say
no,
no,
if
you
can
not
make
a
section
3(i)
finding
you
can't
do
anything.
well,
i
say
that
the
law
is
against
them
on
that.
your
honors
decision
in
the
milwaukee
case,
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
cardozo
in
that
case
echoed
by
judge
henry
friendly
in
the
new
york
central
iron
ore
case
down
in
--
which
is
cited
on
our
briefs
show
perfectly
clearly,
that
there
is
no
question
abut
the
power
of
the
commission
when
they're
faced
with
a
rate
war
to
prescribe
a
reasonable
relationship
and
to
do
so
without
making
any
independent
finding
of
prejudice
under
section
3(1)
as
such,
they
have
the
power
to
do
that.
now,
the
solicitor
general
says,
in
effect,
well,
i
don't
dispute
that
they
have
the
power,
but
i
suggest
that
this
case
would
be
referred
back
to
them,
so
they
can
make
more
findings,
they
should
make
a
fully
distributed
cost
study,
a
fully
distributed
cost
study.
well,
now
i
submit
if
your
honor
please,
so
they
haven't
made
a
court
finding.
now,
i
submit
that
here
is
the
case
in
which
the
appellee
have
chosen
their
ground,
they
say
it
doesn't
make
any
cost,
make
no
difference,
we're
not
going
to
give
you
any
cost
evidence,
we're
not
going
to
respond
to
any
efforts,
although
they
are
reminded
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
them.
you'll
find
in
here
when
the
commission
declined
to
force
them
to
submit
cost
studies,
they
reminded
them
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
them.
now,
although
reminded
of
their
burden
they
said,
“no
sir,
we
choose
to
take
the
position
that
costs
are
immaterial.
they
admit
the
lower
cost.
what
is
there
to
remand
the
case
to
the
commission
for?
nobody
argues
against
--
can
argue
against
the
lower
cost,
they're
conceded.
nobody
can
argue
against
the
fact
that
the
careers
are
badly
over,
that's
conceded.
nobody
can
argue
against
the
fact
that
you
have
a
rate
war.
now,
one
last
thing,
they
say,
what
this
all
--
issue
all
disappeared
from
the
case
when
it
got
before
the
commission.
i
mean,
before
the
district
court,
how
did
that
happen?
they
said
there
was
no
cross
appeal.
your
honors,
what
was
there
to
appeal
from?
the
southern
carriers
had
found
conditional
matching
rates
to
take
effect
only
in
the
event
that
the
rates
of
the
northern
carriers
became
effective.
since
the
rates
of
the
northern
carriers
were
ordered
canceled,
theirs
automatically
fell
with
them,
what
was
there
to
appeal
from?
how
could
they
appeal
from
--
there
was
nothing
to
appeal
from.
the
argument
here
is
that
while
the
issue
before
the
commission
was
one
thing,
it
suddenly
disappeared
when
it
came
before
the
district
court.
i
submit
if
your
honor
please,
that
if
that
is
the
best,
that
counsel
of
the
evidence,
that
the
counsel
in
this
case
can
figure
out
a
reply
to
this
argument.
then
all
i
can
say
about
that
is
that
it
indicates,
i
think,
that
the
argument
must
be
a
pretty
strong
one.
now
it
seems
to
me
that
there
can
be
no
reasonable
ground
for
doubt
that
faced
with
the
situation
which
the
commission
found
itself
here,
once
they
had
answered
the
arguments
which
justice
goldberg
had
indicated
that
they
were
to
be
answered
in
this
case,
once
they
had
examined
into
those
question
and
satisfied
themselves.
i
see,
i
have
one
more
minute,
i'd
like
to
say
one
more
word
about
this
business
of
--
well,
if
they
are
equalized
everywhere
else
why
not
here?
your
honor,
the
answer
is,
new
york.
you
don't
have
a
new
york
anywhere
else
overshadowing
these
other
ports.
new
orleans
did,
overshadowed
galveston
and
the
commission
did
there
insist
on
a
differential.
your
honors
reversed
them,
but
then
the
congress,
i
think
reversed
you,
and
incidentally
there
were
a
four
man
minority
there
that
reached
by
chief
justice
hughes,
mr.
justice
stone,
mr.
justice
brandeis,
mr.
justice
cardoza,
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
congress
established
their
minority
opinion
as
the
law
of
the
land,
is
not
one
which
we
would
cavil
today.
now,
that's
the
real
answer,
you've
got
new
york
completely
overshadow,
now
what
about
boston,
what
about
these
other
ports?
unless
you
are
going
to
say,
that
because
a
port
is
handicapped
as
boston
is
or
portland
or
albany,
that
you
are
going
to
give
them
a
differential
under
the
port
that
has
the
advantage
of
distance
which
the
commission
has
never
done,
never
in
it's
history,
that
would
be
bare
faced
allocation,
that
would
be
bare
faced
allocation
nothing
else,
it
would
be
simply
sitting
up
here
and
saying
boston
hadn't
got
enough,
so
we'll
give
it
a
rate
below
new
york
even
though
the
cost
of
service
is
great.
