mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
thank
your
honor.
this
is
a
sherman
act
case
that
is
here
your
honor
please
from
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio
on
summary
judgment.
the
case
involves
the
white
motor
company,
the
only
defendant.
the
government
attacked,
in
this
case,
white's
own
procedures
for
distributing
the
trucks
it
makes
in
competition
with
other
truck
manufacturers.
the
court
granted
summary
judgment
in
two
respects
that
are
here
pertinent.
it
held
that
it
was
unreasonable
per
se
for
the
white
motor
company
to
specify
exclusive
territories
for
its
dealers
and
distributors.
it
held
that
it
was
unreasonable
per
se
for
the
white
motor
company
to
specify
that
its
dealers
could
only
resell
to
indicated
outlets
or
only
resell
indicated
classifications
of
customers.
it
held
that
all
facts
going
to
the
issue
of
reasonableness
were
irrelevant
and
immaterial.
it
held
that
although
counsel
for
white
urged
below
that
the
elimination
of
these
dealerships
would
result
in
loss
of
dealers,
loss
of
distributors,
diminution
of
competition,
ineffectiveness
of
competition,
but
that
was
immaterial.
this
is
then,
if
your
honors
please,
a
test
case
concerned
with
whether
or
not
a
traditional,
well
established,
long
continuing
trade
practice,
not
only
at
white
which
has
been
engaged
in
this
activity
for
over
50
years,
but
many
other
industries
in
many
areas
of
the
country
is
illegal
per
se
and
we
are
here
simply
on
this
proposition.
we
want
to
have
a
chance
for
a
day
in
court.
we
want
to
have
a
chance
to
show
on
the
facts
of
this
industry
that
this
type
of
exclusive
territorial
dealership
arrangement
is
lawful
and
proper,
is
reasonable,
is
reasonably
ancillary
to
our
purpose,
our
purpose
being
to
compete
and
to
compete
effectively
with
the
larger
concerns
engaged
in
this
truck
business.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
we
are
concerned
only
with
competition
between
white
dealers.
the
white
dealers
are
free
to
charge
the
price
they
will
and
they
are
free
to
compete
in
their
territories
and
urged
to
compete
in
their
territories
as
vigorously
as
possible.
i
would
like
for
a
moment
to
indicate
to
the
court
the
enormous
scope
of
the
rule
that
is
here
urged
by
the
government
for
the
first
time
as
far
as
i
can
determine
in
this
court
and
for
the
first
time
in
many,
many
years
of
the
history
under
this
statute.
this
type
of
arrangement
will
be
unreasonable
per
se
if
the
government
prevails,
whether
a
big
company
uses
it,
whether
a
little
company
uses
it.
whether
a
company
uses
exclusive
dealerships
to
get
into
an
existing
business
and
compete
or
whether
it
is
already
in
the
business
as
an
established
company.
it
will
apply
whether
the
dealer
contract
is
for
three
months,
six
months,
25
years
it
makes
no
difference.
it
will
apply
whatever
the
size
of
the
territory.
and
it
will
apply
in
the
face
of
factual
assertions
that
if
it
is
eliminated
then
the
company
employing
it
is
going
to
lose
business,
is
going
to
lose
dealers,
and
is
going
to
lose
its
competitive
effectiveness
in
the
market.
there
has
never
been
a
more
inclusive
rule
suggested
in
this
court
in
the
sherman
act
deals
to
my
knowledge.
i
tried
to
see
how
could
i
bring
this
to
the
court's
attention
in
a
way
that
would
dramatize
what
this
rule
involves
and
i
took
at
look
at
the
wall
street
journal
in
the
last
couple
of
days,
as
we
were
getting
ready
for
this
argument.
and
you
will
read
in
their
classified
ads,
time
after
time
people
advertise
exclusive
distributorships
whether
it
be
for
steam
baths,
whether
it
would
be
for
gas,
whether
it
be
for
motorboats,
whether
it
be
for
what
you
will.
this
is
an
established,
customary
method
of
doing
business
that
this
district
judge
in
ohio
with
no
proof
in
this
record
other
than
the
contract,
no
proof
whatsoever
other
than
the
formal
provisions
of
the
contract
held
per
se
illegal.
authorities
on
marketing
have
urged
this
is
a
method
of
distribution.
the
department
of
commerce
has
urged
it
in
its
publication
to
fund
the
small
businessmen
who
come
to
seek
advice
as
to
how
should
they
establish
a
successful
method
of
distribution.
the
small
business
administration
has
urged
it
in
its
publications
to
small
businessmen
who
seek
its
advice.
the
federal
trading
commission
which
has
had
this
problem
before
it,
time
and
time
again
has
refused
to
say,
but
it
is
per
se
illegal.
and
yet
the
government
here
urges
a
rule
of
law
which
is
more
absolute
and
more
all
pervasive
then
is
the
requirements
contracts,
with
campbell
electric
case
as
to
tie-in
contracts,
witnessed
the
recent
decision
of
this
court.
this
is
an
absolute
all
inclusive,
immutable
proposal
that
no
one
can
distribute
their
goods
to
dealers
and
specify
that
the
dealers'
sales
shall
be
confined
to
a
particular
area
or
territory.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
is
right
it
has
to
do
with
the
territory
that
the
dealer
may
conflict.
we
are
not
concerned
with
what
is
called
an
exclusive
dealership.
we
are
concerned
with
a
dealer,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
who
is
limited
as
to
the
territory
in
which
he
may
sell.
now,
may
i
now
turn
to
a
reference
to
the
decisions?
there
are
no
decisions
in
this
court,
in
any
way,
shape
or
form,
holding
that
this
type
of
arrangement
is
unlawful.
this
is
a
matter
of
first
impression
in
this
court.
but
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
sherman
act
and
the
history
of
the
development
of
a
law
of
restrain
at
common
law
is
all
in
favor
of
this
type
of
restriction.
i
refer
of
course
to
the
ancillary
restrain
doctrine
enunciated
by
judge
taft
in
the
addison
case,
repeatedly
referred
to
in
the
law
review
articles
and
decisions
of
this
court
on
standard
oil
on
and
by
the
federal
trade
commission
in
its
decisions
since
that
time.
a
simple
ancillary
restraint
doctrine
which
says,
that
where
the
purpose
is
lawful
it
is
appropriate
for
the
seller
of
goods
to
attach
restrains
reasonably
ancillary
to
the
accomplishment
of
his
lawful
purpose,
where
the
effects
do
not
unreasonably
restrict
competition.
this
is
what
the
restatement
says,
is
the
law.
this
is
what
has
been
said
to
be
the
law
at
common
law
and
said
to
be
the
law
until
this
particular
case.
we
have
decisions
in
our
brief
i
won't
go
through
them,
you
will
see
them,
where
cement
is
sold
on
restriction
that
it
will
only
be
resold
or
sold
in
texas.
we
have
cases
where
dealers
have
been
sold
and
have
been
sustained
on
condition
they
will
only
sell
outside
of
the
united
states.
this
type
of
limitation
or
restriction
was
recognized
even
in
cases
like
associated
press
and
board
of
trade
by
this
court
and
there
is
--
it
has
never
been
challenged
until
today.
now,
what
does
the
government,
what
does
the
government
say,
and
i
would
like
to
deal
with
each
of
the
government's
arguments
because
the
government
has
no
case.
the
government
offers
no
decision
here
to
support
its
position.
the
government
presents
ad
hominem
arguments,
which
it
would
like
to
have
considered
by
the
court.
it
says
first,
that
there
are
no
business
justifications
for
this
arrangement.
it
says
second,
surprisingly
enough,
like
what's
all
are
talking
about,
the
restrains
could
be
accomplished
in
another
way.
and
finally
they
say,
why
should
we
not
have
a
per
se
rule.
it'll
make
things
a
great
deal
easier
for
us
prosecutors,
because
all
we'll
have
to
do
is
throw
these
contracts
into
court
against
judgment,
we
don't
have
to
go
through
the
time-honored
process
of
trial
and
the
time-honored
process
of
determining,
case-by-case,
industry-by-industry,
fact-by-fact
whether
a
particular
arrangements
benefits
trade
and
commerce
furthers
the
objectives
of
the
act
or
does
the
contrary.
no
business
justification
may
say
you
could
do
it
another
way
they
say
and
they
also
urged
all
prosecutors,
let's
get
an
easy
rule
so
we
don't
have
too
much
time
and
trouble
in
court.
now
let
me
first
talk
about
the
business
justification,
and
they
are
substantial.
the
white
motor
car
company
competes
with
general
motors,
ford,
chrysler,
international
harvester,
and
concerns
of
that
magnitude.
they
are
growing
in
their
power
and
in
their
influence
in
this
industry.
the
white
motor
company
for
50
years
has
had
this
type
of
system
because
it
has
found
that
it
is
way
for
it
to
get
small
businessmen
to
act
in
various
communities
as
its
dealer.
now
what
does
the
dealership
involve,
not
only
the
sale
of
trucks,
but
the
very
important
factor
of
servicing,
many
of
these
trucks
operating
as
your
honors
are
aware
of
across
state
lines
and
this
system
of
dealership
is
essential
to
the
development
of
adequate
service
facilities
in
various
areas
of
the
country,
and
it
is
essential
to
the
encouragement
of
men
to
enter
into
this
type
of
business.
the
statistics
in
the
record
show
that
the
average
sales
of
a
dealer
are
around
about
$250,000,
i'm
advised
that
the
average
investment
is
around
the
$150,000.
we're
concerned
with...
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor,
the
white
sales
are
in
the
record.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
there
are
around
200
million,
around
200
million
and
there
is
a
schedule
that
your
honors
will
find
at
page
93
of
the
record,
which
shows
a
breakdown
of
those
sales
by
various
classifications
of
customers.
but
again
those
are
questions
of
fact
mr.
justice
goldberg,
which
have
to
be
explored.
how
effective
are
these
big
companies
against
white?
are
they
encroaching
on
its
dealerships
or
aren't
they
encroaching
on
it?
we
don't
know,
we
don't
know
any
of
those
facts.
we've
got
this
absolute
per
se
rule.
now
these
dealers
moreover,
if
your
honors
please,
have
as
one
of
their
functions
the
development
of
appropriate
types
of
truck
for
the
users
need.
white
trucks
are
custom
made.
the
trucks
are
engineered
for
the
requirements
of
the
particular
user.
to
get
people
who
are
willing
to
make
the
investment
in
service
facilities,
the
investment
in
showrooms,
the
training
of
the
personnel,
to
undertake
this
type
of
operations,
white
contents
it
must
give
them
territorially
limited
dealerships.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
they
are
independent
businessmen
mr.
justice
harlan,
as
far
as
the
record
shows.
there
is
no
evidence
to
the
contrary.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
question
about
that.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
we
don't
know.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
mr.
chief
justice
there
isn't
a
question
you
could
ask,
but
if
i
don't
give
you
the
answer
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know
how
many
of
them
have
territorial
distributorships
and
how
many
don't.
we
don't
know
how
many
of
them
sell
directly
through
their
company
organizations
and
how
many
sell
through
dealers
and
distributors
limited
or
not
limited.
we
don't
even
know
to
what
extent
a
ford
or
chevrolet
dealer
has
both
trucks
and
the
added
advantage
of
all
its
private
cars
in
its
dealership.
all
of
those
questions,
which
i
submit
would
be
appropriate
and
pertinent
in
connection
with
the
presentation
of
the
evidence
in
this
kind
of
case,
are
barred
by
this
absolute
rule
that
is
urged
by
the
government.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yes
it
is.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
i
do
not
know
when
this
industry,
i
have
an
impression
that
territorial
dealerships
were
abandoned
by
general
motors
and
ford.
there
is
some
testimony
in
congressional
hearings
for
that
effect.
there
is
also
a
case
i've
seen
where
recently
judge
foreman
held
that
arrangements
of
these
kinds
were
not
per
se
unreasonable
in
dealing
with
volkswagen,
not
a
direct
competitor,
but
an
automotive
manufacturer.
but
the
precise
facts
are
not
clear.
my
statement
to
the
court
was
that
many
industries
utilized
this
method
of
distribution.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
it
is
certainly
clear
that
the
major
ones
have,
i'm
not
as
clear
as
to
all
of
them.
i'm
not
sure
what
the
situation
is
to
mac,
international
harvester
and
some
of
them
are.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
i
understand
that
general
motors
and
ford
as
i
said
and
i
believe
chrysler
do
not
use
these
at
least
in
passenger
cars,
which
is
what
they
were
testifying
about.
i
don't
know
what
they
do
in
trucks.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
yeah,
it
had
to
do
with
passenger
cars
--
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
--
mr.
justice
stewart
and
i
don't
know
the
precise
situation.
i
understand
that
at
the
present
time
ford
is
experimenting
with
different
methods
of
distribution
that
was
used
in
the
past.
all
of
these
questions,
however,
the
lower
court
tells
this
court
are
important
to
ask
or
immaterial,
should
not
be
considered,
or
outside
the
preview
the
case.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
i
was
not
in
the
lower
court
mr.
justice
goldberg.
counsel
for
the
white
company
filed
no
affidavit.
he
made
however
a
statement
in
his
brief
of
the
facts
he
attempted
and
contemplated
proving
and
the
court
in
its
opinion
dealt
with
those
facts
as
though
they
have
been
affidavited.
you'll
see
at
page
62
and
63
of
the
record,
a
discussion
of
some
of
those
facts
that
some
setout
by
the
district
court
at
63,
following
which
he
says,
“such
considerations
have
no
materiality
to
the
issues
presented
before
the
court.”
so
the
matter
was
treated
as
though
these
were
on
affidavit
and
there
is
no
claim
made
by
the
government
to
the
contrary.
now,
i
would
like
next
turn
to
a
suggestion
that
the
government
offers
and
i
really
believe
this
gives
the
case
away,
the
government's
case
away.
i
consider
it
quite
important
to
the
general
position
here.
the
government
urges
in
its
plea
at
pages
25
and
26
that
we
can
do
this
in
another
way.
that
we
can
accomplish
these
restraints
just
as
readily
some
other
way
and
that
therefore
we're
doing
it
the
wrong
way,
in
effect.
the
solicitor
general
says
that
if
he
were
running
a
truck
company
this
is
the
way
he'd
like
to
do
it.
he
suggests
the
primary
responsibility
notion
that
is
to
say
that
we
would
require
the
dealer
to
spend
a
certain
percentage
of
his
time
in
the
territory,
a
certain
percentage
of
his
money,
a
certain
percentage
of
his
personnel
and
that
we
would
establish
a
broad
steam
of
requirement,
and
believe
it
or
not,
utilize
the
colgate
case
if
any
dealer
didn't
measure
up.
in
other
words,
the
government
says,
we
can
blunt
competition.
we
should
try
to
blunt
competition.
they
recognize
value
in
this
as
a
distribution
matter,
but
they
say
to
do
it
by
contract
is
wrong,
that
we
must
to
do
it
by
these
other
devices.
now
in
the
first
place,
the
government
opposed
any
primary
responsibility
doctrine
of
this
kind
in
the
lower
court
and
though
we
saw
it
we
didn't
get
it
from
the
district
judge,
but
putting
that
aside,
i
suggest
to
your
honors
that
it's
most
conceptual
and
legalistic
to
suggest
that
we
can
accomplish
this
one
way
and
not
another.
can
we
require
the
dealer
under
their
theory
to
spend
50%
of
his
time,
75%,
90%,
99%,
we
don't
know
what
percentage
of
money
can
we
require
him
to
devote.
all
of
these
matters,
the
government
says
can
be
looked
at
in
terms
of
reasonableness
and
i
say,
that
is
a
conceptual
approach.
and
if
it
is
true
as
they
suggest
that
some
procedure
for
encouraging
dealers
to
take
territorial
franchises
is
appropriate,
what
is
there
to
say
that
in
this
industry
under
the
competitive
circumstances
presented
by
this
industry,
this
contract
plan
is
not
a
desirable
as
any
other.
and
i
want
to
say
that
i
find
it
rather
difficult,
having
argued
parke-davis
in
this
court,
to
hear
the
suggestion
that
by
various
interaural
methods
we
can
cancel
dealers,
if
they
don't
do
what
we
want
them
to
do
in
an
assigned
territory.
the
only
alternative
here
that
white
can
see
is
that,
if
these
dealers
cannot
be
supported
by
these
contracts
it
must
itself
go
into
the
direct
business
of
selling
even
more
than
it
does
today.
it
sells
roughly
50%
directly
itself
and
what
will
that
do?
that
will
simply
result
in
many
dealers
losing
their
jobs,
losing
their
investment,
losing
their
livelihood
and
i
say
to
what
social
purpose,
for
what
economic
reason,
purely
a
conceptual
position
at
best
because
on
this
record
there
is
no
justification
for
the
government's
position.
now
if
i
am
may,
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
another
aspect
of
the
case
and
that
is
the
claim,
that
this
will
save
time,
that
this
per
se
rule
will
really
make
it
a
great
deal
easier
to
try
these
cases.
i
find
that
a
difficult
argument
to
me
except
by
saying
that
i
understood
and
still
understand
that
before
some
rules
not
found
in
any
statute
is
imposed,
that
a
man
should
have
a
chance
for
his
day
in
court
and
a
chance
to
show,
that
his
conduct
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
this
broad
ambivalent
statute.
the
idea
that
we
are
to
suddenly
say
that
every
dealer
who
has
one
of
these
contracts
throughout
the
united
states
whether
it
is
white
or
somewhere
else
is
engaged
in
both
criminal
conduct
and
conduct
which
is
illegal
and
that
the
basis
of
which
his
business
is
founded
is
to
be
destroyed
seems
to
meet
the
far
more
important
a
concept
than
the
notion
that
some
days
can
be
saved
of
court
time.
these
economic
issues
do
not
necessarily
require
the
large
amount
of
time
that
the
government
now
suggests.
and
it
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
argument
that
the
government
makes
here
when
it
says
that
although
we
are
entitled
to
summary
judgment,
we
are
able
to
argue
that
there
is
no
business
justification
for
this
arrangement,
that
although
we
are
entitled
to
summary
judgment
we
are
able
to
argue,
white
could
do
it
better
some
other
way.
and
although
we've
never
tried
the
case
we're
able
to
argue,
we
can
do
it
much
less
time
if
we
do
it
this
way.
you
were
asked
without
any
experience
in
this
court
on
prior
cases
to
promulgate
in
effect
a
new
statute,
which
simply
and
clearly
says,
that
no
dealer
maybe
required
by
contract
from
the
seller,
vertically,
ancillary
to
the
sale
of
his
product
to
limit
his
sales
to
a
specified
carrier.
now
the
other
restrictions
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
are
of
a
very
different
character,
but
again
the
position
of
the
government
is
the
most
novel.
as
i
have
told
you,
white
works
closely
with
the
dealer
in
the
development
of
types
of
trucks,
custom
built,
to
meet
the
needs
of
particular
users
and
it
is
therefore
quite
natural
that
white
has
contracted
with
its
dealers
that
he's
not
to
sell
those
trucks
for
resale
except
to
authorized
outlets.
it
is
very
anxious
to
preserve
its
good
name,
the
product,
integrity
and
it
is
very
anxious
that
it
does
not
lose
business
by
putting
its
trucks
in
hands
of
people,
who
will
misengineer
them
to
the
needs
of
a
particular
consumer.
now
that
type
of
restriction
again
reasonably
ancillary
to
the
sale
of
the
trucks
is
prevalent
throughout
american
business.
it
is
stricken
here
by
the
same
broad
order
of
the
court
to
instruct
the
territorial
arrangements
as
you
will
see
from
the
form
of
the
injunction,
which
appears
on
page
7
of
our
brief.
we
have
cited
a
considerable
series
of
cases
showing
that
arrangements
of
this
kind
and
comparable
arrangements
ancillary
to
the
sale
of
products
will
be
found
have
been
upheld
by
other
decisions.
it
seems
to
me
also
patently
reasonable
on
its
face
to
say
that
it
is
appropriate
and
proper
for
a
manufacturer
of
a
complex
article
like
a
truck
to
have
the
right
and
opportunity
to
see
that
it
reaches
the
ultimate
users
in
a
form
best
suited
to
the
need
of
that
particular
user
and
that
is
what's
the
main
restriction
on
this
phase
of
the
case
is
concerned
with.
there
is
also
a
limitation
against
dealers
selling
to
the
government
without
permission
of
white
and
the
record
shows
that
commission
has
never
been
withheld.
that
restriction
seems
to
me
to
be
hardly
one
under
that
set
of
fact
that
could
held
to
be
unreasonable
per
se
particularly
when,
as
the
government,
i
think
itself
concedes
and
certainly
as
the
cases
show,
the
seller
of
goods
may
agree
with
his
dealer
that
he
will
not
compete
with
his
dealer
at
all,
a
rather
common
aspect
of
merchandizing.

you
will
see
the

at,
the
answer
to
interrogatories

by

which
states
that,
that
permission
was

mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
that
permission
was
not
refused,
page
13
of
the
writ.
now,
in
brief
then
my
position
is
simply
this.
we
want
white
to
have
a
chance
and
have
a
trial.
we
want
an
opportunity
to
show
what
we
told
the
district
court
we
could
show
that
our
livelihood
in
this
business
depends
upon
this
arrangement,
that
we
can
do
a
better
job
against
the
big
fellows
with
this
arrangements,
and
that
if
it
is
stricken
down
its
effect
will
be
no
way
to
put
many
of
our
dealers
out
of
business,
but
it
will
hamper
our
own
competitive
energies.
mr.
gerhard
a.
gesell
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
at
the
outset
in
replying
to
the
solicitor
general,
to
make
perfectly
clear
certain
business
facts
which
we
are
in
controversy
about
here,
both
of
us
talking
without
any
record
before
us.
and
at
the
opening
of
his
remarks
he
suggested
that
when
i
said
that
there
are
a
large
number
of
small
businessmen
dependent
upon
territorially
limited
distributorships,
that
i
was
talking
about
exclusive
distributorships
and
not
about
territorially
limited
distributorships
of
the
kind
we
have
here.
well
i
was
talking
just
about
that
and
i
was
talking
about
the
ads
that
appear
in
the
current
wall
street
journal
telling
people,
small
businessmen
who
are
concerned
with
vending
machines,
food
products,
health
equipment,
that
they
have
protected
exclusive
territories
that
they
can
chose,
that
they
have
protected
areas
for
automatic
fire
protection
or
the
ad
that
appears
in
the
middle
of
the
new
yorker
today
and
in
the
middle
of
the
sports
illustrated
for
hatteras
yachts
says,
dealers
are
carefully
selected
and
their
territory
is
protected.
we
are
dealing
with
a
common
inherent
practice
here
which
the
commerce
department
and
other
agencies
of
government
have
endorsed
and
encouraged
and
on
which
many,
many
small
businessmen
all
over
this
country
are
depended
upon
for
their
livelihood
and
in
respect
of
which
and
reliance
on
which
they
like
the
white
dealers
have
made
substantial
capital
investment
and
stake
their
all
in
an
effort
to
make
a
living.
now
we
heard
today
about
the
mammoth
white
motor
company.
the
entry
of
ford
and
general
motors
into
the
large
truck
field
is
of
recent
origin,
and
what
would
this
court
say
if
the
record
were
to
show,
as
i
believe
it
would
show,
were
we
to
go
on
trial,
that
as
these
large
integrated
organizations
have
entered
into
the
big
truck
field,
white's
business
is
diminishing,
that
as
they've
chosen
some
certain
categories
and
types
of
trucks
to
merchandise,
white's
business
has
gone
down.
that
as
they
sent
their
engineers
into
their
own
branch
offices
to
offer
competition
to
white,
white
is
suffering.
we
don't
know
those
facts,
but
that's
the
kind
of
record
we'd
have
here,
if
we
had
our
day
in
court.
now
i
would
like
to
discuss
next,
the
suggestion
that
this
is
just
like
any
other
horizontal
arrangement,
just
like
any
horizontal
arrangement.
in
the
first
place
we
have
no
findings
to
that
effect.
in
the
second
place
we
have
no
decision
to
that
effect,
but
let
me
point
this
out.
the
solicitor
general
says
that
we
can
tell
our
dealers
to
confine
their
showrooms
to
a
particular
territory,
that
we
can
tell
our
dealers
that
they
can
put
so
much
money
into
their
territory
and
they
must
put
so
much
energy
and
effort
into
their
territories
as
not
percentage
wise
i
gather
it
has
to
be
dollar
wise,
wouldn't
he
be
here
saying
to
you
however,
that
if
the
dealers
so
agreed
to
such
arrangement
that
that
was
equally
illegal.
could
these
dealers
get
together
and
agree
they
would
all
keep
their
showrooms
away
from
each
other.
could
they
get
together
and
all
agree
to
a
primary
responsibility
doctrine
into
which
they
would
say
let's
not
compete
but
let's
keep
all
our
money
in
a
given
territory
or
most
of
our
money
or
most
of
our
sales
effort.
he
is
caught
with
the
proposition
that
he
recognizes
that
when
a
man
sells
his
goods,
his
primary
interest
is
competing
with
others,
not
destroying
himself
by
his
own
competition.
and
he
suggests
other
ways
which
if
they
were
agree
to
among
dealers
would
be
equally
restrictive.
the
argument
presented
this
morning
to
the
court
has
been
premised
on
the
assumption
not
in
the
record
that
the
primary
purpose
and
objective
of
white
motor
company
was
to
prevent
competition
between
its
dealers.
i
say
that
is
not
a
fact.
i
say
it
is
not
proven
and
it
would
not
be
so
shown
on
trial.
the
purpose
of
white
is
to
compete
with
the
other
brands.
the
purpose
of
white
is
to
be
successful
in
a
tough
changing
competitive
business
and
the
limitations
or
restraints
or
whatever
you
wish
to
call
them
are
merely
ancillary
to
that
affirmative
purpose
and
when
white
said
that
if
you
destroy
these
arrangements
will
lose
our
dealers
and
competition
will
lessen,
the
district
court
said,
that
is
immaterial.
an
argument
was
advanced
this
morning,
an
argument
was
advanced
this
morning
that
we
had
prohibited
price
competition
and
that
therefore
this
case
was
like
dr.
miles.
i
don't
understand
that
argument,
because
that
isn't
what
this
record
shows.
every
dealer
is
free
to
choose
what
price
he
wants
to
charge
for
a
white
truck.
he
is
not
like
the
dr.
miles
situation
for
having
resale
price
maintenance
imposed
upon
him.
he
not
only
cannot
compete
with
others
who
sell
dr.
miles
prescription,
but
he
cannot
change
his
price
to
meet
the
competition
of
others.
the
white
dealers
are
completely
free
within
their
territory
to
charge
what
price
they
will,
to
offer
what
service
they
can.
and
their
position
therefore
is
not
the
rigid
position
that
a
dr.
miles
resale
price
maintenance
type
situation
creates
whatsoever.
each
of
these
dealers
has
price
flexibility
and
price
ability
to
compete.
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
discuss
another
aspect
of
the
solicitor
general's
argument.
he
urges
on
you
that
only
where
there
has
been
a
sale
of
a
capital
item,
of
capital
goods
has
the
ancillary
restraint
doctrine
been
accepted
by
this
court.
now
i
think
that
is
patently
not
the
case
on
any
fair
reading
of
the
line
of
authorities
starting
with
addison
pipe.
price
has
been
singled
out
as
of
special
consequence
because
of
its
historical
position
in
common
law
and
because
of
the
fact
that
price
control
and
monopoly
are
inherently
the
same
thing
and
the
discussion
of
the
court
at
the
time
of
standard
oil,
the
discussion
of
the
court
and
later
in
print
and
pottery,
the
discussion
of
the
court
throughout
the
development
of
this
fall
has
set
prices
in
a
special
different
category
and
we
recognize
the
rule
of
reasons
as
it
applies
in
respect
of
other
restraints,
other
than
price.
and
when
the
solicitor
general
says,
let's
take
this
and
throw
it
in
with
all
of
the
other
practices
that
have
held
per
se
illegal,
what
are
those
practices?
what
is
that
great
host
of
per
se
violation
that
this
court
has
established?
there
is
no
per
se
rule
as
the
tie-in
contract.
mr.
justice
black
made
clear
in
his
opinion
that
under
certain
set
of
facts
in
the
north
pacific
case
the
tie-in
contract
there
failed,
but
not
all
tie-in
contracts,
not
under
all
circumstances.
what
is
it
is
the
requirements
contract?
we
don't
have
any
per
se
rule
as
to
them.
i
know
of
no
per
se
rule
in
the
field
of
general
restraint,
putting
aside
the
pack
of
questions
for
a
moment,
other
than
price.
so,
when
he
says
that
put
this
in
the
area,
what
is
he
talking
about?
and,
then
i
ask
the
court
to,
and
i
hope
it
listens
carefully
to
the
exceptions
that
are
suggested
here.
in
answer
yesterday
to
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
statement
was,
well
this
might
not
apply
in
the
case
of
a
new
company
entering
into
a
market.
we'd
have
to
suggest
that
maybe
if
somebody
was
coming
with
a
new
automobile
let's
say
and
it
wanted
to
penetrate
against
these
big
companies
but
maybe
it
would
be
all
right
to
let
them
do
this.
it
was
also
suggested
that
if
white
was
failing,
it
might
be
all
right
for
it
to
do
it,
but
the
rule
we
have
here
that
you're
asked
to
affirm
has
no
such
qualification.
and,
if
you
affirm
this
judgment
below,
even
the
exceptions
of
the
solicitor
general
talks
about
are
not
available
to
any
litigant
here.
and
then
i
want
to
ask
you
as
a
practical
matter,
what
is
the
difference
between
a
new
company
entering
a
business
and
an
old
independent
established
company
subsisting
in
the
business,
in
the
face
of
encroaching
and
every
increasing
competition?
what
is
the
legal
difference?
what
is
the
social
difference?
what
is
the
practical
difference?
i'd
say
there
isn't
there,
and
i
would
say
the
questions
has
to
be
explored
by
this
court
that
you
must
look
at
the
circumstances
under
which
this
business
has
been
developed,
why
these
territorial
arrangements
are
necessary
or
not
necessary,
what
their
effect
is
on
competition
overall?
we
have
no
dealer
testimony.
we
know
nothing
about
these
dealers,
but
i
suggest
that
they
would
testify
that
they
aren't
going
to
make
an
investment
of
$150,000
looking
towards
business
a
year
of
around
$250,000
unless
they
have
some
assurance
that
when
they
construct
the
service
facilities
and
the
showrooms
and
take
the
other
training
and
other
experiences
necessary
and
to
get
into
a
position
where
they
can
participate
in
the
custom
construction
of
these
trucks
that
they
have
some
chance
to
develop
a
specified
area
themselves.
now,
it
was
suggested
that
this
is
an
ordinary
common
variety
kind
of
a
case
of
everyday
sale
of
goods
out
of
stock.
i
never
understood
why
united
states
printed
this
mass
of
contract
that
makes
up
the
bulk
of
this
record.
but,
if
you
look
at
them,
you'll
see
that
the
dealers
there
in
most
instances
carry
white's
name.
you
will
see
that
under
the
contract
they're
allowed
to
use
white's
name
for
the
duration
of
the
contract.
i
have
told
you
that
they
participate
with
white
in
the
engineering
and
custom
building
of
these
models
to
meet
particular
customer's
needs.
this
is
analogous,
i'd
say,
to
the
very
type
of
situation
which
was
presented
by
the
solicitor
general.
goodwill
is
involved.
the
dealers
by
their
contract
are
participating
with
white
in
the
development
of
its
business.
it
was
suggested
that
a
decision
of
this
court
in
bausch
and
lomb
threw
out
restrictions
of
the
kind
we
have
here.
i
would
emphasize
that
that
decision
and
we've
discussed
it
in
great
detail
in
our
opposition
with
a
motion
to
affirm
had
to
do
with
the
restrictions
which
the
court
found
were
ancillary
to
and
in
assistance
of
a
price
fixing
scheme.
and
of
course
if
these
arrangements
were
to
have
been
held
by
the
district
court
or
were
to
be
presented
here
as
ancillary
to
and
part
of
a
price
fixing
scheme
their
status
in
a
decree
would
be
quite
different,
but
it
is
conceded
here
and
it
was
so
held
by
the
judge
below
that
these
limitations
and
restrictions
must
be
viewed
fully
independent
of
price
and
the
solicitor
general
offers
to
you
the
opportunity
to
hold,
that
absent
any
price
problem
of
any
character,
you
are
going
to
strike
down
in
this
and
all
other
industries
these
types
of
limitations.
consider
what
would
be
involved?
the
man
who
wishes
to
sell
his
goods
only
through
certain
types
of
department
stores,
he
couldn't
do
that
any
longer.
the
man
who
wishes
to
sell
his
goods
only
through
certain
types
of
drug
stores,
he
couldn't
do
that
any
longer.
the
man
who
wishes
to
promote
his
business
by
selecting
individuals
in
areas
couldn't
do
that
any
longer
unless
those
people
were
willing
to
take
on
that
obligation
knowing
that
they
would
have
absolutely
no
protection
from
either
the
sellers'
own
competition
or
the
competition
of
others
to
whom
he
sells.
the
whole
structure
of
american
business
is
not,
has
not
developed
along
those
lines.
it
is
traditional
that
a
person
who
is
selling
his
goods
is
a
man
who
is
seeking
not
to
kill
himself
by
his
own
competition
with
himself
but
is
seeking
to
compete
with
others.
and
consider
what
is
presented
to
white?
if
this
system
goes
down
what
is
white's
alternative?
it
is
not
his
primary
responsibility
proposition
which
has
been
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general
because
to
begin
with
that
was
not
permitted
by
the
order
below.
white
might,
if
it
could
raise
the
money,
go
into
this
business
itself.
it
could
establish
branch
offices
everywhere,
as
some
of
the
bigger
companies
are
tending
to
do.
if
their
port
could
sell
entirely
through
its
own
branch
offices
and
we
certainly
are
in
the
day
where
one
would
say
that
white
had
to
say
that
its
branch
offices
would
compete
interstate.
so
that
all
of
white's
energies
could
be
devoted
to
inter-brand
competition
and
what
would
be
the
result?
the
dealers,
the
small
fellows,
the
little
businessmen
who
are
participating
with
white
in
this
venture
would
be
out
of
business.
and
i
say
a
rule
that
does
that
not
only
as
to
white,
but
does
that
to
every
other
type
of
distribution
in
this
country
over
a
whole
host
of
products
is
not
a
sensible
rule
and
that
you
should
have
before
you,
in
approaching
these
problems,
not
only
the
white
case
tried
with
the
evidence
before
you,
but
other
cases
tried
with
the
evidence
before
you
until
your
experience
and
your
knowledge
of
these
distribution
practices
was
sufficient
to
enable
you
to
know
the
effects
of
what
you
are
doing.
because
certainly
this
is
not
a
case
such
as
was
handed
down
yesterday
by
this
court
where
there
is
some
exquisite
statutory
directive
with
which
you
are
concerned
with
interpreting.
we've
got
in
the
nature
of
a
constitutional
provision
here.
we
have
no
requirement
on
the
court
of
this
character
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
court
should
not
write
it
into
the
statute
as
they
knew
statutory
provision
without
the
economic
experience
and
the
case
experience
which
is
the
proper
way
to
decide
it.
look
what's
happened
in
colgate?
there
has
been
a
gradual
development
of
the
colgate
doctrine
on
a
case-by-case
method.
why
should
there
not
be
a
gradual
development
here
in
the
time
honored
rule
of
reason
method
to
determine
to
what
extent
distribution
practices
of
this
kind
should
be
encouraged
and
to
what
extent
distribution
practices
of
this
kind
should
be
discouraged.
it
is
suggested,
using
mr.
justice
black's
opinion,
that
there
can
be
no
redeeming
purpose
in
arrangements
of
this
kind.
i
say
there
is
a
redeeming
purpose.
it
is
the
purpose
to
continue
in
business
and
to
compete
effectively.
and
the
suggestion
that
there
is
any
other
dominant
or
purpose
here
is
certainly
not
established
by
this
record.
it
couldn't
be
on
a
summary
of
judgment
record.
so
i
ask
your
honors
to
send
this
case
back
and
give
us
a
chance
to
try
the
case.
