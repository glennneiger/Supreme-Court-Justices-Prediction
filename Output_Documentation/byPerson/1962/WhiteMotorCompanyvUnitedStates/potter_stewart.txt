that
testimony
had
to
deal
with
automobiles
rather
than
trucks.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
where
and
how
mr.
gesell
does
the
record
that
that
permission
has
never
been
withheld,
except
for
this
summary
judgment?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
they
forced
the
term,
the
price
fixing
is
out
of
the
case
apparently,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
it
was
being
out
of
the
case
in
as
much
as
the
counsel
for
the
appellant
concedes
that
the
inclusion
of
that
back
there
in
the
contract
did
violate
it.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
couldn't
precisely
the
same
argument
be
made
with
respect
for
example,
to
a
merger,
if
you're
going
to
stick
to
the
literal
words
of
the
statue,
you
read
out
the
great
many
decisions
of
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
unless
you've
given
a
rather
special
kind
of
a
case,
certainly
there
are
other
types
of
mergers
where
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
which
at
least
the
parties
are
not
put
on
a
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
might
not
the
justification
be,
which
at
least
they
might
not
be
entitled
to
be
heard
rather
than
have
summary
judgment
go
against
them
that
in
order
to
compete
against
say
the
big
three,
these
two
little
fellows
had
to
merge
and
eliminate
competition
between
them
in
order
to
compete
against
big
three
in
some
industries
in
volume.
wouldn't
that
be
almost
exactly
the
same
kind
of
evidence
of
such
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
just
the
point
of
mr.
gesell's
argument.
it's
not
in
the
record.
neither
side
was
permitted
to
put
in
evidence.
justice
potter
stewart
one
aspect
of
his
case,
we
have
the
promise
not
to
â€“
of
the
buyer
not
to
compete
with
the
seller.
justice
potter
stewart
just
in
this
government's
case,
was
there
a
surplus
commodity,
did
government
promise
not
to
compete?
