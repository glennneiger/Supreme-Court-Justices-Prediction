mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
beginning
i
think
it
is
well
to
recall
the
facts
of
this
case.
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
exclusive
distributorships
kind
of
arrangements
which
mr.
gerhard
referred
is
so
common
in
american
business.
an
exclusive
distributorship
is
generally
used
to
describe
an
arrangement
whereby
a
company
indicates
that
it
will
give
a,
the
exclusive
right
to
locate
his
office
for
selling
goods
in
new
york.
b,
the
right
to
locate
at
philadelphia,
c,
in
baltimore,
and
a,
b
and
c
are
free
to
make
sales
of
wherever
and
to
whomever
they
can.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
arrangement
that
is
involved
here,
and
the
position
of
the
government
is
very
different
with
respect
to
those
two
arrangements.
the
findings
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
its
there
undisputed,
show
that
white
entered
into
contracts
with
its
distributors
and
dealers
and
direct
dealers,
i
should
use
the
term
interchangeably,
i
think
there
is
no
significance
in
this
particular
contract,
has
entered
into
these
contracts
the
distributors
and
dealers,
forming
a
combination
to
eliminate
all
competition
in
the
sale
of
white
truck.
specifically
each
dealer
or
distributor
contracted
with
white
not
to
sell
a
white
truck
to
a
firm
having
its
place
of
business
outside
his
exclusive
territory.
so
there
could
be
no
competition
among
the
distributors
and
dealers.
second,
they
were
required
to
promise
not
to
sell
white
trucks
to
certain
classes
of
customers,
including
the
state
and
federal
government.
third,
they
had
to
promise
not
to
sell
white
trucks
to
any
person
for
resale
without
white's
approval,
and
finally
they
were
required
to
promise
to
observe
on
the
resale
of
parts
inside
the
trucks,
prices
set
by
white.
these
were
the
contracts
that
were
before
district
court.
we
submit
that
the
inclusion
of
any
one
of
these
four
promises
in
the
distributor's
contract
and
a
fortiori
the
inclusion
of
all
four,
violates
the
sherman
act
without
the
necessity
of
any
further
proof
and
therefore
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
properly
granted.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
out
of
the
case
in
the
sense
that
being,
there
wasn't
any
appeal
taken
from
it
and
the
essential
part
is
the
agreement
that
was
held
illegal.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
it
does
--
it
wasn't
and
i
don't
lay
any
--
i
don't
want
to
lay
any
great
stress
on
this.
indeed
i
was
just
about
to
go
on
in
saying
that
we
just
do
it
and
that
the
important
aspect
of
the
case
is
the
allocation
of
exclusive
sales
territory
to
each
distributor
and
we
do
argue
that
and
that
alone
would
be
illegal
so,
that
i
don't
lay
any
great
stress
on
this.
it
was
part
of
the
original
contract
you
know
that
--
about
that.
the
important
aspect
is
the
allocation
of
exclusive
sales
territory
to
each
distributor
with
the
result
the
distributors
are
forced
to
promise
not
to
compete
with
each
other
in
the
sale
of
white
trucks
and
that's
the
part
of
the
case
on
which
i
should
concentrate
my
oral
argument,
and
show
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
holding
that
a
manufacturer's
contracts
allocating
these
exclusive
sales
territories
among
these
distributors
are
illegal
per
se.
i
should
also
like
in
the
beginning
to
outline
the
argument
so
that
the
court
might
see
its
direction
before
we
begin
to
discuss
the
problem
in
more
detail.
our
major
and
indeed
undisputed
premise
is
that
there
exists
a
critically
important
classification
under
the
sherman
act,
holding
the
contracts
which
in
terms
restrain
competitions
without
any
significant
business
justification
other
than
such
as
alleged
to
flow
from
the
restrain
of
competition
are
illegal
per
se.
the
point
was
most
comprehensively
stated
by
the
court
by
mr.
justice
black
in
the
northern
pacific
railway
case.
there
are
certain
agreements
or
practices
he
said,
which
because
of
their
pernicious
effect
on
competition,
and
lack
of
any
redeeming
virtue
are
conclusively
presumed
to
be
unreasonable,
and
therefore
illegal
without
elaborate
inquiry
as
to
the
precise
harm
they
have
caused,
or
the
business
excuse
for
their
use.
and,
he
then
went
on
in
the
course
of
the
opinion
to
list
of
number
of
illustrations
of
the
kinds
of
contracts
that
are
illegal
per
se.
price
fixing,
resale
price
fixing,
group
boycotts,
tie-in
clauses,
and
particularly
the
vision
of
the
markets,
among
potential
or
actual
competitors.
now
for
example,
a
series
of
agreements
between
white's
dealers
promising
that
each
might
have
an
exclusive
territory
in
which
to
sell
the
white
truck
would
be
illegal
per
se.
and
the
only
question
here
is
whether
you
will
circumvent
that
rule
by
making
the
promise
to
the
manufacturer
instead
of
to
each
other.
our
minor
premise
which
is
of
course
disputed
is
that
white's
contracts
eliminating
all
competition
in
the
sale
of
white
truck
by
dividing
markets
among
its
dealers
belong
in
the
same
category
of
per
se
violations
that
i
have
just
mentioned.
the
basic
reasons
for
the
per
se
rule
i
shall
show
are
equally
applicable
to
the
present
contracts,
and
the
theoretical
distinction
or
perhaps
i
should
say
formal
distinction
between
horizontal
agreements
allocating
territory,
which
are
concessively
illegal
per
se
and
the
vertical
arrangements
here
involved
is
however
good
in
theory,
when
which
we
think
is
utterly
impractical.
after
discussing
those
points,
i
shall
turn
to
the
appellant's
contention
that
the
distributors'
promises
not
to
compete
are
ancillary
covenants
and
therefore
permissible
if
reasonable.
our
answer
is
that
the
both
principle
and
the
authority
show
that
those
restraints
are
plainly
not
ancillary
both
under
this
court's
decision
and
under
the
classic
common-law
doctrine.
then
towards
the
end
of
my
argument,
i
want
to
discuss
the
authorities
both
primary
and
secondary.
now
we
are
accused
of
standing
and
are
seeking
to
run
a
grand
state
by
torrents
of
authority
and
in
oral
argument
if
i
want
to
go
mr.
gesell,
that
this
was
the
first
time
in
illegal
history
that
the
government
had
made
such
a
contention.
upon
examination
i
think
the
court
will
find
that
the
contract
is
not
anything
of
its
kind
that
if
they
distinguishable
trickle
with
a
handful
of
cases
on
this
point
which
favor
them
as
that
as
much
as
they
do
us.
and
as
far
as
illegal
history
goes,
the
first
time
our
position
was
taken
was
by
judge
julian
mack
in
a
charge
to
a
jury
in
1915
and
1916,
that
since
1949
the
department
of
justice
has
regularly
advocated
this
position
and
has
succeed
in
a
large
number
of
industries,
did
i
think
i
could
say
almost
as
regularly
succeeded
in
getting
consent
decrees
acquiescing
in
our
view.
so,
we
think
there
is
nothing
very
startling
or
shocking
or
novel
about
the
position
we
advocate
here.
since
it
is
conceded
that
there
is
this
large
class
of
contracts
and
combinations
in
restraint
of
trade
including
horizontal
allocations
of
territory
that
are
illegal
without
further
inquiry,
we
may
turn
it
once
to
the
question
whether
the
vertical
allocations
of
exclusive
sales
territory
fall
in
the
same
per
se
category.
the
common
characteristics
of
the
contracts
that
have
been
held
illegal
per
se
seem
to
me
to
be
two.
first,
that
they
directly
and
in
most
cases
in
terms,
restrain
competition.
second,
they
have
little
or
no
business
justification,
save
the
benefits
that
are
alleged
to
flow
from
the
restriction
of
competition.
in
other
words,
i'm
drawing
a
distinction
between
a
transaction
of
such
a
merger
or
a
requirements
contract,
which
may
serve
business
purposes,
but
which
cannot
be
consummated
without
also
eliminating
a
certain
amount
of
competition.
then
there
is
some
occasion
to
balance
the
business
justification,
and
economic
advantage
is
served
by
the
combination,
against
the
loss
in
the
competition,
but
in
the
classification
where
the
restrains
are
held
illegal
per
se,
those
have
been
--
where
the
argument
in
a
attempt
to
justification
of
was
that
its
a
bad
thing
to
have
competition
here,
there
will
be
economic
purposes
served
by
eliminating
competition
and
that
is
a
line
of
argument
that
this
court
has
regularly
refused
to
hear.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
two-fold.
let
me
answer
first
by
putting
a
slightly
different
case,
but
one
which
seems
to
be
the
same
principle.
let
us
suppose
that
this
manufacturer
has
concluded
that
the
[inaudible]
that
the
only
way
that
he
could
break
into
the
industry
was
by
entering
into
contracts
with
distributors
fixing
the
resale
prices
and
that
otherwise
no
distributor
would
want
to
deal
with
his
car.
i
take
it
that
under
the
dr.
miles
case
and
the
accepted
line
of
authorities
in
this
court
that
that
proof
would
be
excluded.
the
only
possibility
and
the
first
half
of
my
answer
is
that
it
seems
to
us
that
these
contracts
are
exactly
like
the
resale
pricing
fixing
contracts.
now
it
is
possible
i
think
that
the
resale
price
case
and
if
so
maybe
this
case
should
be
made
an
exception
for
something
like
the
failing
company
doctrine
that
we've
had
in
the
merger
cases,
that
is
to
say
if
it's
a
brand
new
company
and
the
evidence
is
that
it
wouldn't
otherwise
be
there
at
all,
because
it
hasn't
been
able
to
enter
the
market
or
its
reached
the
point
where
it
is
about
to
fail
then
i
would
concede
there
was
at
least
an
argument
to
be
made.
i
don't
want
to
concede
that
we
wouldn't
invoke
the
doctrine
then.
i
don't
think
we
have
to
face
quite
that
question
in
this
case,
because
whatever
was
said
in
the
briefs
of
white's
attorneys
in
district
court,
they
did
not
deny
that
white
was
in
business
and
they
did
not
contend
that
it
was
on
the
verge
of
failing.
so
that
i
think
that
here
really
the
question
mr.
justice
goldberg
is
this,
the
argument
would
then
--
the
argument
then
and
i
shall
develop
it
a
little
later,
comes
down
to
the
proposition,
well
we
offered
proof
that
one
form
of
competition
inter-brand
competition
is
better
than
intra-brand
competition.
and
as
to
that
we
say,
that
that
is
not
an
enquiry
that
it
is
open
to
the
courts
to
make.
the
sherman
act
said,
you
shall
not
enter
into
contract
in
restraint
of
trade
and
that
means
you
share
the
other
end
of
contract
not
to
compete
with
each
other.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
difference
is
this.
in
a
merger,
let
me
compress,
let
me
put
two
cases
and
i
think
the
decisions
this
court
make
this
clear.
suppose
we
have
two
companies
that
are
selling
incandescent
light
bulbs,
a
new
machine
is
invented
for
making
bulbs,
it
happened
quite
of
a
century
to
ago
now,
which
it
was
usable
only
if
you
had
a
certain
volume
of
production
and
these
two
companies
neither
of
them
alone
can
afford
to
invest
in
one
of
these
machines
although
it
would
greatly
reduce
the
cost
of
production.
so
they
merge
in
order
to
buy
the
corning
bulb
machine
and
there
is
of
course
an
elimination
of
competition
between
them.
there,
there
is
an
occasion,
if
you
are
going
to
have
the
normal
business
transaction
of
a
merger
to
achieve
the
business
purpose
of
taking
advantage
of
this
new
machine,
you
must
have
some
elimination
of
competition
between
them.
i
would
contrast
with
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
take
it
that.--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
take
it
that
nearly
all
such
mergers,
all
mergers
in
which
the
parties
invoke
some
business
justification,
some
business
motivation
other
than
the
desire
to
eliminate
competition.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
--
it
seems
to
be
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
far
more
analogous
to
the
case
like
the
socony-vacuum
oil
case
or
the
fashion
originators'
guild
case.
in
the
socony-vacuum
case
you
will
recall,
that
it
was
argued
that
the
price
fixing
agreement
was
that
there
should
be
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
stabilizing
prices
was
good
for
the
industry,
it
was
good
for
the
economy,
that
indeed
it
was
in
accord
with
the
government's
policy
under
the
nra.
and
this
court
held
that
no
showing
of
so
called
competitive
abuses
or
evils
that
those
agreements
were
designed
to
stimulate
or
alleviate
maybe
interposed
as
a
defense.
and
again
in
the
fashion
originators'
guild
case,
there
the
guild
argued
that
it
was
entitled
to
introduce
evidence
in
support
of
its
contention,
that
its
practices
were
reasonable
and
necessary
to
“to
protect
the
manufacturer,
laborer,
retailer,
and
consumer
against
the
evils
of
competition
from
style
piracy
and
had
in
fact
benefitted
all
four”.
and
this
court
held
that
the
federal
trade
commission
had
properly
excluded
that
testimony
saying
that
it
was
legally
irrelevant.
the
reason
was
that
these
benefits
were
alleged
to
flow
from
the
elimination
of
competition,
whereas
the
sherman
act
i
suggest
says
that
competition
shall
not
be
eliminated
just
for
the
sake
of
eliminating
competition
and
other
things
that
follow.
the
per
se
doctrine
is
bottomed
on
the
principle
that
the
policy
that
congress
embodied
in
the
statue
it
is
not
to
be
reversed
on
the
ground
that
congress
was
wrong
in
requiring
competition
in
this
institute.
it
may
have
stated
it's
so
broadly
as
to
cover
contracts
which
had
two
purposes,
one
a
normal
business
preference,
the
other
to
eliminate
competition
and
thereby
achieve
certain
benefits.
but
in
the
second
sort
of
case,
the
court
certainly,
standard
sanitary
case,
allowed
its
own
measure
of
right
and
wrong
of
what
it
permits
or
prohibits
and
the
judgment
of
the
courts
cannot
be
setup
against
it
and
in
a
supposed
accommodation
of
it's
policy
with
the
good
intention
of
the
parties
and
it
may
be
of
some
good
results.
mr.
archibald
cox
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
court
rose
yesterday,
i
was
in
the
middle
of
discussing
our
principle
proposition
here,
which
is
that
this
case
has
so
many
of
the
characteristics
common
to
the
other
restraints
in
trade
that
have
been
held
unlawful
per
se,
that
it
should
be
placed
in
the
same
category.
in
the
course
of
that
discussion,
i
pointed
out
that
in
many
of
those
other
cases
the
court
had
refused
to
inquire
into
the
alleged
justification
that
it
made
the
restraint
brief,
because
apparently,
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
alleged
justification
was
something
which
instead
of
being
the
main
point
of
the
transaction,
flowed
exclusively
from
the
restraint
of
competition.
so
that
an
effort
was
being
made
to
argue
that
in
this
instance,
competition
is
a
bad
thing
or
this
is
bad
competition
as
opposed
to
good
competition.
i
want
to
make
it
plain
that
our
case
does
not
depend
on
asserting
as
an
absolute
generalization
that
the
court
will
never
--
that
no
case
can
exist
in
which
the
court
will
hear
the
justification,
that
competition
is
a
bad
thing.
i
know
of
no
such
case,
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
assert
that
none
can
possibly
arise.
the
thrust
of
our
argument
here
is
simply
by
analogy
that
this
case
is
so
linked
the
other
per
se
restraint,
especially
resale
price
fixing
and
territorial,
horizontal
territorial
allocation,
that
it
should
be
placed
in
the
same
category
without
attempting
to
espouse
any
broader
generalization.
now,
let
us
look
a
little
more
closely
at
the
characterizing
of
these
territorial
restrictions
that
white
imposes
on
its
dealers
and
see
whether
they
are
not
the
same
in
principle
and
in
those
respects,
as
the
other
per
se
restraints.
first,
it
is
clear
that
these
territorial
restrictions
do
eliminate
competition
and
not
merely
price
competition,
but
all
competition
in
the
sale
of
white
trucks.
that
is
a,
plainly
a
restraint
of
trade,
it
serves
no
independent
business
purpose
other
than
that
of
restraining
trade
and
it
imposes
a
very
important
kind
of
restraint.
we
know
ever
since
the
writings
of
professor
edward
chamberlin
on
monopolistic
competition
that
one
of
the
tendencies
in
an
economy
increasingly
dominated
by
a
few
large
manufacturers
has
been
for
each
to
try
to
differentiate
its
product,
so
that
it
obtains
at
least
at
the
manufacturers,
at
the
distributor
level,
some
of
the
characteristics
of
the
monopolistic
market.
now,
if
we
go
on
and
eliminate
all
competition
in
the
sale
of
a
brand
on
down
to
the
public,
a
very
important
form
of
competition,
which
has
effects
on
the
price
structure
and
everything
else,
is
being
eliminated.
so
there
could
be
no
doubt
here
that
these
white
contracts,
territorial
restriction
do
eliminate
competition
in
an
important
form.
the
only
justifications
which
appellant
asserts
to
these
contracts
come
under
the
heading
competition
among
our
dealers,
it
is
a
bad
thing
for
them,
and
a
bad
thing
for
us
and
we
ask
the
court
to
conclude
that
it's
bad
thing
therefore
for
the
public.
in
order
to
demonstrate
that,
that
is
true,
i
would
like
to
be
sure
to
depart
from
the
argument
and
take
white's
own
brief.
dealing
with
this
point,
white
says
first
on
page
11,
“in
some
instances
it
is
competitively
effective
for
a
manufacturer
to
make
certain
that
only
one
dealer
is
selling
its
good
to
residents
of
a
particular
area.”
then
we
go
on
and
the
reasons
appear
over
on
pages
12
and
13.
the
first
reason
toward
the
bottom
of
page
12,
“white
on
the
strength
of
this
kind
of
contract
has
built
up
substantial
goodwill
in
its
organization
of
independent
dealers
and
distributors
because
the
contracts
assure
that
white
dealers
will
have
resources
to
scour
their
territories,
but
hard
to
get
sale
since
they
will
have
the
security
of
getting
the
easier
large
volume
white
customers
in
their
area.”
well
this
it
seems
to
me
is
simply
an
argument
our
dealers
feel
is
goodwill,
because
we've
assured
them
that
they
won't
have
to
compete
with
each
other.
one
could
make
the
same
argument
that
any
price
fixing,
any
resale
price
fixing,
any
horizontal
allocation
of
territory,
it's
simply
they
don't
like
to
compete
and
they
love
us
because
we
don't
make
them
compete
or
because
we
free
them
from
competition.
then
going
on,
one
finds
next,
i'm
up
at
end
of
the
paragraph
on
page
13
--
beginning
on
page
13,
that
appellant
criticizes
the
white
dealer
who
jumps
territorial
boundaries
at
a
strategic
moment
and
snatches
away
the
pre-sold
customers,
skipping
on
why
is
that
subject
to
criticism?
individual
dealers
need
the
cream,
that
is
easy
to
get
sales,
that
they
wouldn't
get
if
there
was
another
white
dealer
competing
with
them,
and
for
two
reasons,
not
only
in
order
to
be
able
to
sell
less
lucrative
accounts,
but
also
in
order
to
have
the
financial
strength
to
maintain
adequate
service
facilities.
and
at
another
point
it
is
said
that
if
the
dealers
don't
compete
with
each
other
for
the
more
lucrative
accounts,
then
they
will
be
able
to
compete
more
vigorously
with
general
motors
and
ford.
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
argument
is
that
the
dealers
by
making
more
money
through
the
elimination
of
competition
in
the
sale
of
white
trucks
with
other
white
dealers,
will
appellant
says
be
able
to
do
two
things,
first
to
compete
more
vigorously
with
other
truck
manufacturers
and
second
to
be
able
to
spend
more
money
on
their
service
department.
now
this
is
the
kind
of
decision
which
the
sherman
act
intends
to
be
made
by
a
free
market.
it's
not
for
the
appellant
or
with
deference
for
a
court,
to
say
that
it
is
better
for
the
economy
to
have
less
money
go
into
competition
in
the
sale
of
white
trucks
and
to
have
more
money
go
into
building
up
service
departments.
the
whole
theory
of
our
economy
and
the
whole
theory
of
the
sherman
act
is
that
the
consumer
shall
make
the
choice.
he
may
go
and
try
and
get
the
best
price
or
he
may
go
to
someone
who
charges
a
little
higher
price
and
therefore
get
better
service
on
his
truck
in
later
years
after
he
buys
it,
and
similarly
the
theory
is
that
it
is
--
should
be
left
to
the
free
play
of
the
economy
to
determine
whether
we
will
have
inter-brand
competition
or
intra-brand
competition
or
what
combination
of
the
two,
rather
than
the
private
persons
white
agreements
that
are
serving
no
other
purpose
should
come
in
and
say
no
we
won't
have
intra-brand
competition,
we
will
concentrate
on
inter-brand
competition.
now
i
should
say
in
candid
that
there
is
one
other
argument
that
has
been
made,
although
i
don't
find
it
in
the
appellant's
brief,
in
support
of
territorial
restrictions
by
manufacturers
on
dealers,
which
it
is
said
do
not
exist
where
the
dealers
combine
simply
at
a
horizontal
level.
the
suggestion
was
made
by
my
colleague
professor
turner
at
harvard
that
this
kind
of
territorial
restriction
has
the
advantage
of
ensuring
that
the
dealer
will
concentrate
intensively
on
a
certain
geographical
area,
that
getting
hungry
as
a
horse
does
if
you
confine
him
to
too
small
a
pasture,
they
won't
range
widely
seeking
to
get
timothy
and
clover,
but
will
be
driven
to
eat
some
of
the
weeds,
and
the
leaves,
the
round
stubble
which
is
to
the
advantage
of
the
manufacturer.
even
professor
turner
himself
concludes
that,
that
justification
is
not
sufficient
to
offset
the
very
marked
restrictions
on
competition
that
this
kind
of
territorial
agreement
imposed.
a
second
answer
is
that
the
kind
of
intensive
cultivation
of
the
territory
that
the
manufacturer
is
interested
in
can
be
achieved
without
imposing
these
restraints
on
competition,
and
of
course
it's
at
this
point
that
we
made
certain
suggestions
as
to
what
white
might
do.
contrary
to
my
brother's
suggestion,
we
never
said
there
are
other
ways
of
restraining
trade
that
will
do
the
same
thing
that
are
preferable
form.
we
said
there
are
ways
of
ensuring
intensive
cultivation
that
do
not
impose
these
same
restraints
on
trade.
one
way
is
requiring
of
the
dealer
to
put
in
a
specified
amount,
not
a
percentage,
a
specified
amount,
please
these
are
important
here,
a
specified
amount
of
salesman
or
money
or
effort
measured
in
some
other
way
in
exploiting
his
particular
assigned
territory
for
which
he
is
responsible.
another
measure,
which
would
come
close
to
accomplishing
--
accomplish
much
of
this
result
is
through
the
exclusive
dealership,
which
we
do
not
argue
is
per
se
unlawful,
which
we
recognize
is
a
question
dependent
on
the
facts
of
each
particular
case,
but
which
does
give
the
dealer
a
territory
for
which
he
is
responsible.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
there
is
no
difficulty
here
certainly,
because
in
its
reply
brief,
white
it
concedes
that
these
are
reasonable
alternatives
to
accomplish
every
purpose
except
one.
it
says
while
the
suggestions
of
the
government
are
relevant
to
keeping
unzealous
dealers
up
to
the
mark.
mr.
archibald
cox
page
16
of
the
reply
brief,
about
half
way
down
the
main
type.
these
suggestions
scarcely
touch
the
basic
problem
of
how
the
dealers
maybe
kept
in
financial
shape
to
fulfill
the
obligations.
in
other
words,
we
must
relieve
them
from
competition,
so
that
they
will
make
more
money,
and
then
they
will
be
in
better
shape
to
carry
out
the
obligations
that
rest
upon
them.
now
certainly
this
is
an
argument
that
has
been
rejected
over
and
over
and
over
again.
the
most
precise
rejection
of
it
came
in
the
dr.
miles
medical
case
back
where
the
court
was
speaking
of
course
of
resale
price
fixing,
but
the
parallel
between
the
argument
that
mr.
gesell
makes
in
the
reply
brief
that
we
must
give
our
white
dealers,
assure
our
white
dealers
more
money,
so
that
they
may
compete
more
effectively,
is
exactly
the
argument
that
was
made
by
the
dr.
miles
medical
company
and
rejected
by
this
court.
i
would
like
to
take
a
moment
just
to
point
it
out.
the
dr.
miles
case,
then
justice
hughes
had
said
the
bill
asserts
the
importance
of
a
standard
retail
price,
and
asserts
generally
that
confusion
and
damage
have
resulted
from
sales
less
than
the
prices
fixed,
but
the
advantage
of
established
retail
price
is
primarily
concerned
with
the
dealers.
the
enlarged
profits
which
would
result
from
adherence
to
the
established
rates
would
go
to
them
and
not
to
the
complainant.
this
of
course
is
true
here.
it
is
true
the
inability
of
the
favored
dealers
to
realize
these
profits,
on
account
of
the
described
competition,
that
complainant
works
out
its
alleged
injury,
exactly
the
way
the
appellant
seeks
to
work
it
out
here.
and
then
another
sentence,
if
there
be
an
advantage
to
the
manufacturer
in
the
maintenance
of
fixed
retail
prices,
and
we
say
there
would
be
an
advantage
in
the
territorial
restriction,
the
question
remains
whether
it
is
one
which
he
is
entitled
to
secure
by
agreements
restricting
the
freedom
of
trade
on
the
part
of
dealers
who
own
what
they
sell.
as
to
this,
the
complainant
can
fare
no
better
with
its
plan
of
identical
contract,
than
could
the
dealers
themselves
if
they
formed
a
combination
and
endeavored
to
establish
the
same
restriction,
and
thus
to
achieve
the
same
result,
by
agreement
with
each
other.
if
the
immediate
advantage
they
would
thus
obtain
would
not
be
sufficient
to
sustain
such
a
direct
agreement,
the
asserted
ulterior
benefit
to
the
complainant
cannot
be
regarded
as
sufficient
to
support
its
system.
and
then
in
the
next
paragraph
the
court
holds,
“but
agreements
are
combinations
between
dealers,
having
their
sole
purpose,
the
fixed
prices
are
illegal
per
se”
and
we
say,
completing
the
analogy,
that
agreements
amongst
white's
dealers
to
eliminate
competition
among
themselves
would
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
plainly
be
illegal
per
se.
so
that
speaking
more
generally
this
argument
that
there
are
advantages
through
the
elimination
of
a
particular
kind
of
competition
is
one
that
has
been
rejected
not
only
in
a
very
parallel
context
in
the
dr.
miles
case,
because
it
was
a
similar
argument
that
was
rejected
by
judge
rifkind
in
the
national
lead
case
with
respect
to
territorial
allocations
on
horizontal
territorial
allocation.
and
we
think,
it
is
no
different
really
than
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
in
support
of
all
price
fixing,
are
all
eliminations
of
competition
among
distributors.
now,
there
is
a
second
reason,
why
the
court
has
held
many
forms
of
avowed
restriction
on
competition
to
be
illegal
per
se,
and
that
reason
too
we
think
is
applicable
to
the
present
case.
in
the
northern
pacific
case,
justice
black
pointed
out,
that
the
principle
of
per
se
unreasonableness
avoids
the
necessity
for
an
incredibly
complicated
and
prolonged
economic
investigation
into
the
entire
history
of
the
industry
involved,
as
well
as
related
industries,
in
an
effort
to
determine
whether
a
particular
restraint
has
been
unreasonable,
an
inquiry
so
often
fruitless
when
undertaken.
of
course
the
point
is
in
the
latter
part
contrary
to
what
my
brother
says,
it
is
not
the
burden
on
the
government
approving
its
the
case
or
the
time
or
effort
expended.
the
point
is
if
one
gets
all
done
making
the
inquiry,
he
has
virtually
nothing
but
a
very
broad
and
virtually
unanswerable
question,
on
which
experts
may
differ,
but
which
to
a
very
considerable
extent
is
answered
by
the
philosophy
of
the
sherman
act,
that
the
allocation
of
resources
should
be
determined
by
competition,
that
even
if
there
are
costs
of
competition
in
particular
instances,
in
the
long-run
the
gains
greatly
outweigh
the
cost.
now
this
is
the
very
kind
of
inquiry
that
my
brother
asks
the
court
to
embark
on
in
the
present
case.
let
me
take
just
one
of
the
many
questions
that
would
have
to
be
asked
as
an
illustration.
appellant
argues
that
although
the
contract
suppressed,
indeed
eliminated
intra-brand
competition,
they
will
serve
inter-brand
competition
by
enabling
white
better
to
survive
he
says
as
a
competitor
of
the
giant
non-custom
truck
manufacturers
and
that
if
white
dealers
can't
be
sheltered
from
competition
among
each
other,
there
will
be
an
inevitable
exodus
of
buyers
to
the
giant
manufacturer.
but
who
is
to
say
that
inter-brand
competition
is
to
be
preferred
to
intra-brand
competition?
is
this
a
justiciable
question
or
one
that
the
sherman
act
itself
anticipates
and
leaves
competition
alone.
who
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
the
court
mr.
justice
--
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
which
the
court
has
said
that
we
sustain
an
agreement
suppressing
one
form
of
competition,
because
that
form
of
competition
is
bad
for
the
economy
or
because
that
form
of
competition
is
inferior
to
some
other
form
of
competition.
the
case
that
comes
closest,
which
i
think
your
honors
will
agree
is
a
special
peculiar
case
is
the
chicago
board
of
trade
case
where
it
was
held
that
the
members
of
an
exchange
might
agree
that
they
wouldn't
compete
out
of
the
exchange's
powers,
but
apart
from
that,
i
don't
know
any
case
in
which
it
was
held
that
one
form
of
competition
could
that
be
suppressed
by
agreement
in
order
to
strengthen
other
forms
of
competition.
look
at
the
kinds
of
inquiry
you
get
into.
we've
raised
this
question
in
our
brief,
the
answer
that
the
appellant
made,
well,
when
it
comes
to
comparing
intra-brand
white
competition
with
ford
--
with
inter-brand
competition
with
ford,
general
motors
and
the
other,
the
question
is
hardly
worth
asking.
well
i'm
kind
of
obstinate
and
[inaudible]
and
i
thought
i'd
begin
exploring
the
question
just
a
little
bit.
the
first
thing
i
found
was
that
this
firm
in
a
market
with
giant
competitors
has
net
sales
of
$333
million
a
year.
one
quarter
of
$1
billion.
it's
one
of
the
200
largest
companies
in
the
country.
then
i
looked
a
little
further,
rather
excited
by
interest,
i
found
that
87%
or
88%
of
white
sales
are
in
the
standard
weight
classification,
26,000
pounds
to
33,000
pounds
or
33,000
pounds
and
over.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
in
the
--
it's
not
in
the
record
and
i
don't
argue
that
these
are
--
mr.
archibald
cox
my
--
the
only
point
of
my
argument
is
not
to
make
the
answer
turn
on
this.
the
point
of
my
argument
is
to
show
that
this
is
often,
without
question
who
is
to
decide
and
how
is
the
court
to
decide
that
intra-brand
competition
is
inferior
to
inter-brand
competition,
is
a
meaningful
question,
that
there
are
many,
many
cases
in
which
intra-brand
competition
is
very
useful
and
i
use
this
case
as
an
illustration,
particularly
since
mr.
gesell
speaks
so
often
of
about
competition
with
these
giant
competitors
and
the
danger
that
white,
an
independent
firm,
would
leave,
lose
out
to
the
giant
competitors.
now
in
these
categories,
white
sells
more
trucks
than
ford.
it
sells
more
trucks
than
general
motors.
in
fact
it
sells
almost
as
many
trucks
as
ford
and
general
motors
put
together.
white
and
international
harvester,
the
only
larger
manufacturer
of
trucks
in
these
categories
control
more
than
50%
of
the
market.
now
i'm
quite
sincere
when
i
say
i
don't
mean
that
these
are
facts
which
enter
--
should
enter
into
the
decision
of
the
case,
in
the
sense
that
it
would
be
different
if
white's
position
in
the
market
were
different.
i
do
think
that
they
are
parting
a
repetition
if
i
may
say
so
to
some
of
the
arguments
made
in
the
brief,
and
also
that
they
do
illustrate
the
seriousness
of
our
argument
that
intra-brand
competition
is
an
important
thing,
and
of
our
arguments
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
enquiry
on
which
a
court
should
embark
because
for
one
thing
it's
a
virtually
hopelessly
prolonged
inquiry,
for
another
it's
a
kind
of
inquiry
that
the
courts
have
regularly
refused
to
embark
on,
ever
since
the
pottery's
case
where
the
argument
was
then
made
there
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
eliminating
price
competition
would
be
desirable
and
that
other
forms
of
competition
would
be
better
and
then
it's
coming
back
to
the
argument
was
eliminating
certain
forms
of
price
competition
and
putting
ceilings
on
the
price
would
make
for
a
healthier
competition
on
all,
that
was
rejected.
it
was
rejected
in
dr.
miles
case.
it
was
rejected
in
the
tie-in
clause
case,
the
allocation
of
territory
case.
it's
exactly
the
same
argument,
that
it
seems
to
us
that
appellant
is
making
here.
now
there
is
a
third
reason
for
classifying
vertical
contracts
allocating
territory
among
distributors
as
per
se
violations
of
the
sherman
act.
horizontal
allocations
have
frequently
been
held
to
be
unlawful
per
se,
and
i
suggest
that
no
practical
administrable
distinction
between
the
two
can
be
drawn,
but
surely
the
form
alone
isn't
to
be
regarded
as
decisive.
if
that
were
the
case
the
dealers
could
get
together,
invite
or
put
pressure
on
the
manufacturer
to
stamp
his
name
on
and
then
we
would
have
the
very
same
kind
of
restraint
which
the
law
forbids.
the
participation
of
the
manufacturer,
and
the
fact
that
promises
run
to
him
seems
to
me
to
offer
very
little
protection.
he
may
be
glad
to
help
out
the
dealers
because
he
wants
the
goodwill
that
follows,
we
are
told
from
ensuring
that
they
won't
have
compete
for
the
easy
to
get
sales
nor
can
i
see
any
other
workable
form
of
distinction
between
the
two,
and
this
seems
to
me
an
additional
important
bit
for
classifying
this
case
along
with
the
other
per
se
restraints
in
trade.
now
i
turn
to
a
quite
different
argument
made
by
the
appellant.
appellant
says
well
these
are
ancillary
restraints
and
under
the
historical
doctrine
of
the
common
law,
a
restraint
that
is
ancillary
is
permissible
if
reasonable.
the
promises
that
white
exacts
from
its
dealers
not
to
compete
with
each
other,
we
submit
are
not
ancillary
restraints
as
that
term
was
used
in
the
class
of
common
law
cases
and
the
argument
that
such
governance
are
ancillary
has
been
repeatedly
rejected
by
this
court.
the
term
ancillary
restraint,
properly
understood,
was
simply
a
phrase
for
describing
a
restricted
covenant
that
was
an
integral
part
of
some
larger
commercial
transaction
to
the
consummation
of
which
the
so
called
ancillary
restraint
was
subordinate
and
fairly
essential.
the
prime
example
of
course
is
the
sale
of
a
business.
a
man
could
not
sell
his
business
readily
unless
he
could
give
the
buyer
assurance
that
he
wasn't
going
to
himself
retain
all
the
goodwill.
a
sale
of
a
retail
laundry
business
with
roots
is
the
primer
illustration.
the
covenant
not
to
compete
with
the
person
to
whom
the
business
is
sold
was
virtually
a
definition
of
what
was
sold.
it
was
--
i
am
conveying
the
goodwill,
i'm
not
retaining
the
goodwill,
and
it
was
a
measure
for
making
good
on
that
undertaking.
justice
holmes
stated
this
very
plainly
in
the
cincinnati
packet
case
on
which
appellants
rely
so
much
in
their
reply
brief.
it
would
accomplish
no
public
purpose
he
said,
but
would
simply
provide
a
loophole
of
escape
to
persons
inclined
to
elude
performance
of
their
undertakings
if
the
sale
of
a
business,
the
temporary
withdrawal
of
the
seller
necessary
to
give
the
sale
effect
were
to
be
declared
illegal.
now
there's
another
group
of
cases,
which
i
think
are
really
the
converse
of
the
sale
of
the
business.
those
are
the
cases
where
there
is
the
sale
of
something
like
a
steamship
or
some
other
capital
asset
on
which
a
business
is
founded
and
what
the
vendor
wants
to
sell
and
the
purchaser
wants
to
buy
is
the
asset
and
not
the
business.
and
in
such
cases,
and
i
think
the
policy
of
the
law
in
order
to
encourage
such
transaction
has
permitted
the
seller
to
take
a
covenant
from
the
buyer
that
the
buyer
wouldn't
use
the
steamship
or
perhaps
some
part
of
the
business
or
the
store
or
place
of
business
in
competition
with
the
seller.
there
too
the
covenant
is
almost
a
part
of
the
definition
of
the
subject
sold.
i'm
selling
you
the
ship,
not
my
goodwill
and
steamship
business.
we
think
that
those
cases
are
plainly
distinguishable
from
this
case
on
two
grounds,
both
well
sustained
by
authority.
the
first
is,
that
this
is
not
a
sale
of
some
part
of
a
business
or
of
some
asset
on
which
the
business
is
founded.
it's
the
recurring
sale
of
chavels
that
takes
place
over
and
over
again,
and
either
is
manufactured
or
sold
out
of
stock
and
are
sold
for
resale.
there
is
nothing
novel
about
this
distinction.
the
court
made
the
every
same
point
and
held
it
to
be
determinative
in
the
dr.
miles
medicine
against
park.
indeed
the
dr.
miles
case
squarely
holds
that
promises
to
limit
competition
in
the
resale
of
manufactured
products
are
not
within
the
doctrine
of
ancillary
restraint.
you'll
recall
both
from
the
case
and
perhaps
from
what
i
said
earlier,
that
in
that
case
the
manufacturer
of
a
proprietary
medicine,
upon
agreeing
with
wholesalers
and
retailers
to
distribute
it,
exacted
from
the
covenants,
not
total
covenants
not
to
compete
with
each
other
as
here,
but
covenants
not
to
depart
from
certain
fixed
resale
prices.
counsel
attempted
to
defend
these
promises
by
calling
the
restraint
on
competition
ancillary,
just
as
appellant
does
here.
the
court
rejected
the
argument
saying
that
the
case
is
not
analogous
to
that
of
a
sale
of
goodwill
or
of
interest
in
the
business
or
the
grant
of
a
right
to
use
a
process
of
manufacturing.
the
complainant
has
not
parted
with
any
interest
in
its
business
or
instrumentalities
of
production.
it
has
conferred
no
right
by
virtue
of
which
purchases
of
its
product
may
compete
with
it.
it
retains
complete
control
of
the
business
in
which
it
is
engaged,
manufacturing
what
it
pleases
and
fixing
such
prices
for
its
own
sales
as
it
may
desire.
now
there's
a
second
critical
distinction
between
the
ancillary
restraint
case
and
this
case,
which
also
is
old
and
well
established.
the
ancillary
restraints
which
were
sustained,
all
involve
promises
running
from
the
buyer
of
a
business
or
of
a
steamship
to
the
seller
or
from
the
seller
to
the
buyer,
as
distinguished
from
promises
attempting
to
eliminate,
i
shouldn't
have
said
promises
running
that
way,
all
these
promises
run
that
way,
they
were
promises
running
from
one
to
the
other,
promising
that
the
one
would
not
compete
with
the
other.
the
buyer
would
not
compete
with
the
seller
or
the
seller
would
not
compete
with
the
buyer.
here
of
course
the
effort
is
to
get
promises
from
buyers
not
to
compete
with
each
other.
now
this
point
again
is
to
stand
by
authority.
judge
lurton
later
mr.
justice
lurton
in
a
parallel
case
involving
the
sale
of
drugs
drew
this
very
distinction.
his
opinion
was
expressly
approved
by
this
court
in
the
dr.
miles
medicine
case.
there
he
pointed
out
that
while
a
covenant,
ancillary
covenant
might
be
permissible
where
restraint
was
no
greater
than
necessary
to
enable
the
vendor
to
receive
the
value
of
his
goodwill
or
to
secure
to
the
buyer
the
enjoyment
of
his
purchase
or
to
prevent
the
use
of
property
to
the
prejudice
of
the
seller.
here
dealing
with
the
resale
pricing
fixing
case,
the
only
competition
which
the
contracts
tend
to
suppress
is
competition
between
those
who
buy
his
goods
to
sell
again,
and
this
he
said
was
important.
a
little
later
he
returned
to
the
point
and
emphasized
no
instance
has
been
called
to
our
attention
where
the
main
and
principle
if
not
only
result
is
to
protect
buyers
against
the
competition
of
each
other
and
as
i
say
that
opinion
was
sustained
in
the
dr.
miles
medical
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
the
one,
yes,
that,
what
i've
said
thus
far.
i'd
be
glad
to
answer
your
question,
but
i
just
want
to
make
it
clear,
what
i've
said
this
far
and
most
of
my
argument
is
directed
to
the
territorial
restraint,
but
the
other
aspect
we
think
is
squarely
answered
by
the
bausch
&
lomb
case
and
by
the
mckesson
&
robbins
case.
appellant
attempts
to
distinguish
the
dr.
miles
case
by
saying,
oh
well
that
involved
resale
price
fixing.
the
argument
i
submit
misses
the
whole
point
the
ancillaryness
of
a
covenant
if
i
may
use
that
malapropism,
is
not
dependent
upon
the
character
of
the
restraints
of
trade.
it
depends
on
the
character
of
the
transaction,
but
nothing
that
was
said
by
justice
hughes
in
this
part,
in
answering
the
arguments
that
those
covenants
were
ancillary,
is
inapplicable
to
the
case
here,
nothing
said
by
justice
lurton
in
the
case
approved
by
this
court,
isn't
equally
applicable
to
the
argument
here.
the
point
is
that
promises
given
by
buyers
not
to
compete
with
each
other
on
the
sale
of
channels
for
resale,
are
not
ancillary
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
nor
has
this
court
drawn
a
distinction
between
covenants
against
departing
from
set
resale
prices
and
other
kinds
of
restrictive
covenants
by
a
distributor
to
the
manufacturer
of
goods.
in
the
ethyl
gasoline
case,
you'll
remember,
the
vendor
of
a
patented
fluid
licensed
both
refiners
of
gasoline
and
wholesalers.
and
then
he
attempted
to
require
the
refiners
to
promise
that
they
would
sell
only
to
wholesalers
who
had
licenses
and
the
court
struck
down
those
agreements.
in
the
bausch
&
lomb
case,
the
court
squarely
held
that
a
seller
of
lenses
for
eyeglasses
violated
the
sherman
act
by
exacting
promises
from
its
distributors,
its
wholesale
distributors
that
they
would
sell
only
to
retailers
approved
by
the
manufacturers.
those
deals
with
restraints
that
it
might
it
be
claimed
were
ancillary,
one
as
justice
stewart
just
suggested,
is
a
kind
of
restraint
involved
here,
but
the
court
has
rejected
the
argument
time
and
time
again.
now,
in
the
five
minutes
remaining,
i
would
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
precedents.
first,
we
think
in
principle,
that
the
combination
of
the
cases
holding
that
horizontal
agreements
are
unlawful
per
se,
plus
the
dr.
miles
and
bausch
&
lomb
case,
i'm
almost
compelled,
almost
compelled,
i'm
mindful
of
justice
holmes
saying
to
the
[inaudible],
the
conclusion
that
the
court
below
was
right.
the
cases
in
the
lower
court
that
are
squarely
in
point
are
few
in
number.
the
volkswagen
case
that
my
brother
mentioned
yesterday,
a
district
court
opinion
in
new
jersey
does
squarely
sustain
it.
there
is
an
eighth
circuit
case
in
125
federal
many
years
ago,
dealing
with
the
sale
of
cement,
which
perhaps
sustains
it,
although
it
does
not
appear
in
the
case
as
i
read
it,
that
this
was
more
than
one
distributorship
for
one
year
in
the
state
of
texas,
rather
than
a
planned
spread
all
over
the
country.
now
the
other
cases
that
he
cites
dealt
with
single
sales,
the
one
case
by
the
government
apparently
war
commodities
were
surplus,
and
the
other
of
damaged
goods.
the
government's
position
is
supported
by
a
charge
delivered
by
judge
mack
in
lowe
motor
supplies
company
against
weed
chain
tire
chain
company
back
in
1915
or
1916
and
of
course
the
judge
in
the
court
below
sustained
our
view.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
was
a
case
cited
in
mr.
gesell's
brief,
where
the
government
under
a
statute
authorizing
such
condition,
sold
certain
goods
on
the
condition
that
they
not
be
resold
in
the
united
states.
i
take
it
was
much
like
the
kind
of
restraint
--
i
guess
it
is
a
restraint,
that
on
the
sale
of
warships
as
sometimes
been
imposed.
they
were
not
to
be
destroyed.
they
were
not
to
be
sold
for
scrap
for
certain
time.
it
was
apparently
a
case
of
that
kind,
in
any
event
it
was
a
single
sale,
and
seems
to
me
very
distinguishable
on
that
ground.
now,
the
secondary
authorities
are
divided,
but
i
think
that
the
impression
that
we're
given
of
them
by
the
appellant
is
really
quite
extraordinary.
appellant,
after
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
rely
on
dr.
miles
and
bausch
&
lomb,
says
that,
it
is
worth
noting
that
up
to
the
time
of
the
decision
in
this
case,
no
opinion
of
any
court
nor
any
secondary
authority
had
embraced
that
argument
in
the
half
century
that
had
been
available.
well,
i
found
in
addition
to
the
decision
of
judge
mack,
a
paper
written
by
former
judge
rifkind,
which
is
cited
in
the
appellant's
brief,
where
he
says
if
an
agreement
among
manufacturers
which
allocates
territory
is
illegal,
it
is
hard
to
see
why
a
contractual
scheme
among
the
manufacturer
and
his
two
distributors
is
not
equally
open
to
attack,
and
he
cites
in
the
footnotes,
see
dr.
miles
medical.
so,
it
seems
to
me
that
he
was
relying
on
this
very
argument.
later
in
his
paper,
judge
rifkind
squarely
expresses
the
opinion
that
he
would
think
that
it
would
be
held
that
such
a
set
of
promises
would
be
held
unlawful
as
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act,
although
he
distinguishes
the
exclusive
license
as
i
have
attempted
to
do
here.
in
a
footnote
it
is
suggested
that
among
the
commentators
is
the
learned
incumbent,
assistant
attorney
general,
one
of
government
counsel
herein.
well
knowing
the
[inaudible]
of
those
who've
written
in
academic
life
and
they
are
then
called
upon
to
represent
the
government,
i
fear
that
i
might
find
that
judge
levinger
had
indeed
said
something
inconsistent
with
our
position.
but
i
find
what
he
says
at
the
pages
cited,
is
on
principle
the
strongest
argument
would
appear
to
be
against
permitting,
either
a
horizontal
or
a
vertical
combination
to
agree
upon
territorial
divisions
of
the
market.
so
we
think
that
our
case
is
well
sustained
by
authority
as
well
as
by
principle.
i
mentioned
the
other
authorities,
the
consent
decrees
over
the
last
ten
years
or
so,
and
that
the
common
law
cases
that
are
described
as
a
torrent
of
authority
by
our
brother,
my
brother
indeed
upon
examination
you
will
find
are
few
in
number
and
wholly
distinguishable.
