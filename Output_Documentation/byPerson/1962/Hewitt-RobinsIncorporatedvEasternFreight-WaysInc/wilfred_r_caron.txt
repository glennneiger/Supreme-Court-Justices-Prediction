mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner's
brief
and
to
some
extent
petitioner’s
argument
has
created
by
either
inadvertence
or
intention,
the
impression
that
there
was
deliberate
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
carrier,
respondent.
and
so
in
view
of
that,
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
facts
insofar
as
they
help
to
narrow
the
conduct
involved
and
what
has
been
done
here
which
is
assailed
as
improper.
first
of
all,
the
complaint
merely
refers
to
the
routing
practice
as
unreasonable.
it
does
not
allege
that
it
was
willfully
done.
it
does
not
allege
that
it
was
deliberate
or
that
it
was
discriminatory
at
all.
we
simply
charged
a
rate
that
was
in
accordance
with
the
filed
tariff
and
which
applied
to
the
route
that
was
actually
used.
now,
a
reference
might
be
made
for
a
moment
to
the
report
of
the
commission,
division
iii
which
decided
that
the
routing
practice
in
question
was
not
reasonable.
first
of
all,
the
examiner
that
made
his
report
to
the
division
recommended
that
the
charge
of
unreasonableness
was
unsound
and
should
be
rejected.
however,
the
division
did
not
agree
with
that
and
by
a
2
to
1
decision
found
that
it
was
unreasonable
under
the
act.
now,
what
was
unreasonable?
well,
first
of
all,
let’s
consider
the
routes.
the
interstate
route
was
385
miles
long
or
12
miles
shorter
than
the
intrastate
route.
there
is
a
quote
in
my
adversary's
brief
about
routing
shipments
around
robin
hood's
barn
but
that
really
didn’t
happen
at
all.
actually,
the
intrastate
route
was
3.1%
longer,
although
it
did
involve
a
lower
rate.
now,
the
selection
of
the
route
again
as
disclosed
and
discussed
in
the
icc
report,
was
based
on
matters
so
far
as
the
carrier
was
concerned
of
practicability
and
economy.
it
was
the
feeling
of
the
company
that
the
shipment
could
not
be
practicably
handled
intrastate
and
there
were
reasons
given
for
that,
the
size
of
the
vehicles,
the
fact
that
there
were
less
than
truck
load
shipments
which
had
to
be
broken
down
in
a
terminal
and
so
it
used
the
interstate
route.
one
of
the
commissioners
dissented
on
the
ground
and
by
the
way
this
is
before
t.i.m.e.
on
the
ground
that
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
issue
of
reasonableness
of
past
routing
practices.

wilfred
r.

your
honor.
so
that
--
it’s
been
a
closed
question
all
along
and
it’s
been
a
question
of
reasonableness
and
i
might
say
that
the
argument
of
the
petitioner
has
time
and
again
called
this
a
question
of
reasonableness
referable
to
the
commission
in
the
first
instance
and
to
no
one
else.
there
is
no
doubt
whether
the
commission
had
primary
jurisdiction
subject
to
a
right
of
review
in
a
court.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
only
to
the
extent
that
there
was
a
difference
between
rates
and
routes.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
but
essentially,
the
question
of
reasonableness
involved
the
--
or
similar
administrative
judgment,
it
involves
similar
technical
problems
and
it
does
result
in
the
application
of
a
rate,
certainly.
now,
a
lot
of
stress
has
been
put
on
the
word
intrinsic.
frankly,
i
don’t
understand
why
that’s
important
or
whether
the
word
has
any
significance,
whatever.
now,
i
would
like
first
to
correct
the
few
matters
that
were
brought
out
in
the
course
of
the
argument
properly
petitioned.
i
believe
my
colleague
stated
that
the
shipper
had
no
right
whatever
to
designate
a
route.
i
confirmed
my
contrary
belief
by
telephone
during
the
recess
and
was
advised
by
the
traffic
manager
of
eastern
freight-ways
that
any
shipper
may
designate
a
route
on
the
bill
of
lading
and
if
that
route
is
practicable
and
possible
to
follow,
it
will
be
done.
if
it
is
not
reasonable
or
practicable,
then
of
course
the
carrier
cannot
do
it.
so
far
as
i
understand
the
law,
there
is
no
right
on
the
part
of
the
carrier
arbitrarily
to
refuse,
to
pursue
a
designated
route
specified
by
the
shipper.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
sir
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
if
it
had
been
made,
it
may
well
be
that
it
would
not
have
but
i
don’t
find
that
that’s
one
the
facts
in
the
case
your
honor.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
that
is
my
understanding,
exactly
your
honor.
and
i
might
add,
this
point
does
come
up
so
far
as
i'm
concerned
for
the
first
time
today.
if
the
court
so
inclined,
i'd
be
happy
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
--
to
furnish
a
brief,
should
it
have
significance.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
then
there
is
of
course
that
basic
obligation
to
select
a
cheaper
route
provided
all
circumstances
are
equal.
and
that's
the
very
question
that
came
in
for
the
commission
where
all
circumstances
equal,
was
it
practicable?
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
we'll
be
glad
to.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
what
you
have
in
mind
is
a
question
of
practicability
involved
to
be
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
i
see.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
yes,
your
honor.
now,
on
the
question
of
the
law,
if
it
please
the
court,
frankly,
i
don’t
believe
that
the
petitioner
has
--
is
in
a
position
to
argue
a
common
law
remedy
here.
one
looks
at
the
complaint,
and
one
looks
at
the
proceedings
taken
by
the
petitioner
until
the
t.i.m.e.
case
and
one
finds
a
clear
reliance
upon
a
statutory
duty
upon
a
purported
statutory
cause
of
action.
that
is
the
way
the
case
was
framed.
that
is
the
way
it
was
brought
into
court
and
that
is
the
way
it
went
before
the
commission.
things
changed
a
little
when
we
made
our
motion.
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
statutory
cause
of
action
created
by
part
ii
of
the
act,
in
favor
of
the
shipper
in
the
circumstances
presented
in
this
case.
and
i
submit
that
the
first
holding
of
t.i.m.e.
requires
that
that
be
answered
in
the
negative.
certainly,
there
is
not
specific
grant
of
a
remedy
in
the
act.
and
there
is
none
by
implication
either.
in
t.i.m.e.
when
this
court
considered
the
effect
of
the
statutory
duty
in
section
216
(b),
it
held
that
it
was
only
a
criterion
for
administrative
application
and
that
it
did
not
create
any
legal
rights,
any
enforceable
legal
rights.
now,
in
saying
that,
the
court
was
not
limiting
itself
to
the
question
of
intrinsic
reasonableness
of
race.
it
was
addressing
itself
to
a
broad
construction
of
section
216
(b)
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
there
is
no
statutory
cause
of
action
whatsoever
under
the
circumstances
here
and
that
is
where
is
believe
the
case
should
end.
now
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
not
at
all.
the
obligation
is
there
so
was
the
right
on
the
part
of
the
shipper
and
the
opportunity
to
enforce
it,
much
as
was
done
here
by
a
complaint
properly
filed
with
the
commission,
and
i
might
add
that
350
shippers
do
not
have
to
go
by
it
before
that’s
done.
there
may
be
explanations
why
that
happened,
but
the
point
of
the
matter
is
that
the
no
shipper
is
unaware
or
has
to
be
unaware
as
to
what
route
will
be
followed
or
was
--
as
to
what
the
applicable
tariff
is
or
as
to
what
are
the
possible
routes
available,
certainly
not,
they
are
billed
or
they
pay
in
advance,
they
can
apprise
themselves,
they
can
seek
counsel
and
they
can
file
a
complaint.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
but
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
there
is
no
authority
so
far
as
i
understand
the
law.
in
the
icc,
it’s
a
little
more
reparations.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
well,
first
of
all,
$10,000
is
his
estimate.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
secondly,
that
is
the
result
of
a
--
an
accumulation
and
i
might
say
i
will
go
a
step
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
but
i
don’t
think
that
he
can
acquire
rights
for
himself
by
waiting,
by
failing
to
act.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
surely,
the
result
is
that
if
that
amount
does
spell
out
the
difference
between
the
two
rates
over
this
period
of
time
and
that
he
can
otherwise
establish
a
right
to
recovery
in
light
of
the
t.i.m.e.
case
then
or
rather
--
cannot
establish
a
right,
he
is
out
of
that
$10,000.
by
the
same
token,
i
say
to
the
court
that
he
is
not
out
because
he's
passed
that
along
to
every
shipper
for
whom
he
has
taken
a
shipment
of
goods.
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
that.
that’s
the
way
these
charges
are
setup
and
i
say
that
if
at
this
time,
he
recoups
$10,000
as
his
windfall,
50%
of
which
may
go
to
a
solicitor.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
sir?
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
well,
then
he
have
a
breach
of
express
contract
situation
which
happens
to
be
true
in
one
of
cases
cited
by
the
petitioner.
it
was
a
jersey
case
and
i
frankly
don’t
recall
the
name
right
now
but
there,
there
was
an
express
contract
of
carriage
over
a
given
route
and
the
carrier
unilaterally
decides
to
go
another
way
and
charge
more.
and
there
on
the
theory
of
express
contract,
the
carrier
was
held
to
respond
for
the
difference.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
i
think
it
might
have
been
railroad,
even
frankly
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
look
at
my
brief
to
see
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
well,
there
is
a
substantial
difference
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
--
principally,
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
on
the
score
of
being
--
being
what
your
honor?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
well,
i've
said
a
lot.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
and
now,
we've
got
--
as
i
read
the
t.i.m.e.
case
and
the
principles
upon
which
its
based
and
the
scope
of
the
principles
as
they
were
expressed,
i
frankly
can
find
no
way
to
distinguish
nor
any
need
to
distinguish
the
result
there
in
order
to
reach
a
different
result
here.
i
might
add
that
the
legislature
since
the
t.i.m.e.
case
has
been
exposed
to
a
proposed
amendment
to
the
act
which
would
engraft
a
remedy
under
circumstances
like
this,
there’s
much
had
been
done
prior
to
t.i.m.e.
and
that
attempt
was
unsuccessful
as
well.
i
think
the
legislative
history
as
it
has
built
up
before
and
after
t.i.m.e.
indicates
a
clear
acquiescence,
if
we
can
say
no
more,
acquiescence
by
the
legislature
in
the
construction
placed
on
the
act
by
this
court.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
it
is
sir.
it's
referred
--
i
would
have
to
get
the
page.
it's
referred
to
on
page
6
and
i
refer
to
it
as
house
rule
8031,
they've
adjunct
3059
and
the
language
of
that
proposal
was
substantially
or
identical
to
the
language
of
the
prior
proposed
amendments
which
would
create
a
right
of
recovery
for
any
violation
of
the
duties
imposed
by
the
act.
now,
that
was
never
passed,
as
had
not
been
in
the
prior
proposed
amendments.
to
point
the
fact,
i
think
that
the
relevant
considerations
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
statutory
remedy
are
about
the
same
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
surviving
common
law
remedy.
as
i
say,
i
don’t
believe
the
petitioner
has
the
right
to
argue
that
he
has
a
common
law
remedy
under
the
pleadings
of
this
case.
but
even
if
he
did,
i
say
again
the
rationale
of
t.i.m.e.
and
--
or
to
its
opinion,
would
compel
precisely
the
same
result.
here,
you
would
have
as
in
that
case
the
situation
where
the
court
would
have
absolutely
no
authority
to
determine
in
the
first
instance,
the
primary
question
in
issue.
and
it
would
in
effect
give
the
commission
the
indirect
ability
to
make
a
reparations
award
which
congress
has
by
default
or
however
you
want
to
describe
it,
refused
or
failed
to
give
it.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
exactly
so,
and
there
is
specific
provisions
to
that
effect,
that
is
brought
out.
i
didn't
want
to
dwell
too
much
on
the
comparisons
between
parts
i,
ii,
and
iii,
they
are
so
fully
set
out
in
the
opinion
in
t.i.m.e.
but
that
is
one
of
the
great
distinction
between
part
ii
of
the
motor
carrier
part
and
parts
i
to
iii.
that
were
as
they
spell
out
specific
remedies
that
is
very
noticeably
lacking
in
part
ii
and
that
is
what
compelled
this
court
certainly
to
a
great
extent
to
reach
the
result
it
did.
and
those
considerations
are
no
different,
no
different
at
all
between
the
questions
there
and
the
one
here,
precisely
the
same
considerations
as
far
as
i
understand
the
rationale.
now,
i
go
one
step
further,
this
court
in
writing
its
t.i.m.e.
opinion,
broken
down
to
two
parts
considering
separately
(a)
statutory
remedy,
and
(b)
a
surviving
common
law
right.
i
would
like
to
advance
this
position
which
is
mentioned
in
brief.
i
believe
that
once
you
decide
or
once
it
is
decided
rather
that
the
statute
by
imposing
a
duty
does
not
by
imposing
that
duty
create
legal
rights
that
are
enforceable,
then
certainly
there
is
no
other
standard,
no
other
criteria,
no
other
right
which
can
be
violated
and
give
rise
to
a
remedy
if
the
violation
of
that
standard,
of
that
statutory
obligation
was
not
intended
to
give
rise
to
a
remedy
and
i
don’t
know
of
any
other
standard
that
could
--
i
don't
know
from
what
jurisdiction
it
comes
and
i
really
believe
that
the
decision
in
part
one
of
t.i.m.e.
require
the
result
in
part
two.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
yes
sir.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
oh,
certainly,
there's
a
right
to
recovery.
some
[inaudible]
to
pay
all
the
obligation.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
i
think
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
to
recover
for
damage
to
merchandise?
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
well,
if
i
understand
the
use
of
the
word
mishandling
correctly,
as
meaning
that
there
is
some
deliberate
practice
whereby
they
are
routed
willy-nilly
at
--
without
regard
to
cost
to
the
shipper
and
of
course
there
is
recourse
not
only
before
the
commission
but
as
i
tried
to
point
out
in
the
latter
portion
of
the
brief,
when
you
reach
the
point
where
you
find
a
deliberate
tort,
when
you
have
reached
the
point
where
you
may
even
get
involved
in
a
criminal
conspiracy
to
defraud,
then,
not
only
is
there
recourse
in
the
commission,
there
probably
is
recourse
under
the
criminal
statutes.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
common
law
criminal
remedy
and
very
likely
a
common
law
--
in
other
words,
i
am
not
saying
and
i
don't
mean
to
create
the
impression
that
there
is
no
wrong
that
cannot
be
remedied
under
the
act.
sure,
an
action
for
overcharges
is
subject
to
a
remedy
and
is
specifically
recognized
in
the
act,
section
204,
where
a
statute
of
limitation
is
specifically
spelled
out
for
an
overcharge
claim.
there
is
a
clear
wrong
and
there
is
clear
debt
not
involving
an
administrative
determination.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
absolutely
and
if
i
fail
to
make
it
clear
that
that’s
my
feeling,
i
apologize.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
the
thought
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
well,
i
would
say
that
it
wasn’t
all
my
idea.
i
had
really
nothing
to
do
with
the
t.i.m.e.
case
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
that
is
the
result,
it's
not
an
unfair
result.
i
do
believe
the
t.i.m.e.
case
is
correctly
decided
if
my
opinion
makes
any
difference.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
no,
it's
not.
to
tell
you
why
its
not
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
because
there
are
problems
on
each
side
of
the
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
certainly
and
very
quickly
and
by
the
way,
by
doing
an
inquiry,
can
avoid.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
well
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
i
had
difficulty
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
i'm
sorry
your
honor.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
"based
on
many
shipments
over
the
same
route
after
long
experience
and
certainly
predictable
and
by
the
way
known
in
advanced."
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
well,
if
you
make
reference
to
the
answer
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
there
is
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
that
may
be.
that
may
be
but
i
do
say
this
that,
so
far
as
the
act
goes,
it
is
clear
under
t.i.m.e.
that
the
--
if
there
is
to
be
reparation,
if
there
is
to
be
recovery,
there
is
a
congress
that
will
take
care
of
that
if
it
so
chooses
and
that
is
the
only
point
i'm
making.
i
don’t
argue
that
there
is
complete
equity
in
denying
recovery
of
something
that
might
have
been
an
excess
of
a
proper
rate,
but
i
do
say
that
it
cannot
come
from
anywhere
else
but
a
specific
legislative
amendment
to
the
act
as
construed
by
this
court
in
t.i.m.e.
that
is
my
feeling
your
honor.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
i
really
don’t
believe
i
have
to
take
any
more
time
except
i
would
reserve
if
i
may
--
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
well,
they
were
certainly
doing
that
but
i
don’t
know
as
i
read
the
opinion
that
that
was
made
the
ground
of
the
decision
or
even
played
any
part.
in
fact,
i
think
it
was
a
footnote
but
the
broad
rationale
certainly
didn’t
hinge
on
the
fact
that
there
was
that
machinery
or
procedure
available
for
review
in
advance.
mr.
wilfred
r.
caron
mr.
chief
justice,
under
these
circumstances,
do
you
still
require
an
additional
brief
with
respect
to
that
point?
