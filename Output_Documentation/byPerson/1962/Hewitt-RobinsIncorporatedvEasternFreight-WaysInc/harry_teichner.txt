mr.
harry
teichner
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
the
common
law
action
for
damages
sustained
by
a
shipper
by
reason
of
motor
carrier
misrouting
of
a
shipment
of
goods
has
survived
the
passage
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935,
which
is
part
2
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
the
general
situation
is
not
one
of
novel
impression
with
this
court
because
this
court
had
occasion
to
go
into
the
motor
carrier
act
to
1959
in
a
case
entitled
t.i.m.e.
incorporated
against
united
states.
this
is
an
action
brought
by
a
shipper
of
goods
against
a
common
carrier
by
motor
vehicle
to
recover
damages
for
a
misrouting
of
its
goods.
during
the
years
1952
--
1953
and
1954,
the
plaintiff
in
the
action,
the
petitioner
here
delivered
some
goods,
350
shipments
to
the
defendant,
the
respondent
here,
for
transportation
between
buffalo,
new
york
and
new
york
city,
new
york.
these
goods
consisted
of
foam
rubber
pads.
the
respondent
motor
carrier
was
certificated
and
had
operating
rights
both
interstate
and
intrastate
between
those
two
points.
it
had
filed
tariffs
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
its
intrastate
route
between
buffalo
and
new
york
and
it
had
also
filed
tariffs
with
the
public
service
commission
of
the
state
of
new
york
similarly
for
the
transportation
of
that
commodity
wholly
intrastate.
now,
the
rates
that
were
filed
for
the
interstate
movement
were
higher
than
those
for
the
intrastate
movement.
these
shipments
were
tended
unrouted
to
the
carrier.
the
carrier
chose
to
move
these
shipments
via
its
higher
rated
interstate
route
instead
of
the
cheaper
intrastate
route
and
the
effect
of
that
was
that
the
petitioner
had
to
pay
$10,000
more
for
the
movement.
thereupon,
the
petitioner
instituted
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
seeking
to
recover
the
sum
of
$10,000
as
damages
for
the
misrouting
of
its
shipments
claiming
that
it
had
a
right
to
have
the
carrier
move
the
shipments
via
the
cheapest
route.
in
its
complaint,
the
petitioner
requested
that
the
determination
of
the
action
be
held
in
abeyance
pending
the
filing
of
a
complaint
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
to
have
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
practice
of
the
carrier
was
a
reasonable
one
and
to
have
a
determination
as
to
what
were
the
reasonable
rates.
the
respondent
filed
an
answer
and
in
its
answer,
set
up
as
one
of
its
defenses
that
it
could
not
transport
these
shipments
over
the
lower
rated
intrastate
route
because
of
certain
difficulties.
thereupon,
i
filed
the
complaint
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
i
set
forth
the
facts
and
i
asked
for
a
determination
as
to
what
were
the
reasonable
rates
and
what
would
a
reasonable
practice
under
the
circumstances.
in
other
words,
i
sought
from
the
commission,
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
the
intrastate
route
was
a
reasonable
one
or
whether
it
was
an
unreasonable
one.
the
action
of
the
district
court
was
held
in
abeyance
and
a
full
hearing
was
had
before
the
interstate
commerce
commission
on
that
administrative
issue.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
made
a
decision
and
held
that
the
intrastate
route
was
a
wholly
feasible
route
and
that
the
carrier
should
have
moved
these
shipments
over
the
intrastate
route
so
that
the
shipper
could
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
lower
rate.
now,
when
that
decision
came
down,
the
carrier
felt
aggrieved
and
thereupon
instituted
a
suit
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
against
the
united
states
of
america
and
against
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
asked
for
an
annulment
of
the
commission's
decision
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
supported
by
the
evidence
or
record.
that
suit
was
tried
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey,
but
before
the
court
made
a
decision
and
while
the
action
was
still
pending
in
the
district
court
of
new
york,
this
court
decided
the
t.i.m.e.
case.
now
in
the
t.i.m.e.
case,
this
court
decided
that
a
shipper
of
goods
by
a
certificated
motor
carrier
cannot
challenge
in
post-shipment
litigation,
the
reasonableness
of
the
carrier's
charges
which
were
made
in
accordance
with
the
tariff
governing
the
shipment.
thereupon,
the
carrier
made
a
motion
in
the
district
court
of
new
york
in
this
action
for
summary
judgment
on
the
theory
that
the
t.i.m.e.
case
was
authority
for
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
a
justiciable
issue
was
not
presented
upon
which
relief
could
be
granted.
that
motion
was
granted
and
judge
bicks,
district
court
judge
bicks
who
wrote
the
opinion
in
the
matter,
stated
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
referral
to
the
commission
was
necessary
on
the
administrative
issue
as
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
intrastate
route,
therefore,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
matter
and
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
of
the
matter.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
that
court
affirmed,
judge
moore
dissented.
the
majority
of
the
court
likewise
felt
that
t.i.m.e.
compelled
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
it
is
our
position
that
t.i.m.e.
does
not
authorize
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint
in
this
case.
we
contend
that
t.i.m.e.
merely
went
to
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
intrinsic
reasonableness
has
an
issue
on
the
case
would
prevent
the
interstate
commerce
commission
from
taking
jurisdiction
as
well
as
the
courts.
a
case
involving
simpleness
routing
does
not
involve
intrinsic
unreasonableness
of
rates.
the
reason
that
it
is
conceded
for
the
purposes
of
the
suit
that
each
one
of
the
rates,
the
interstate
as
well
as
the
intrastate
rate
is
a
applicable
rate
to
each
one
of
those
movements
and
that
it
is
a
reasonable
rate.
the
only
complaint
is
that
the
carrier
committed
wrong
in
transporting
these
shipments
over
a
higher
rated
route
when
a
lower
rated
route
was
available
--excuse
me.
mr.
harry
teichner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
teichner
well,
that
ruling
remains
at
this
time
and
we
have
intended
to
--
mr.
harry
teichner
well,
it
is
before
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
that
ruling
is
supported
by
evidence
or
record
before
the
commission.
mr.
harry
teichner
not
yet
your
honor.
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
is
awaiting
the
decision
on
this
matter.
so
that,
we
have
a
situation
where
a
motor
carrier
has
committed
a
common
law
wrong
in
exacting
a
charge
for
a
transportation
of
shipments
of
goods
when
the
shipments
were
tendered
unrouted
to
them
and
they
have
the
obligation
of
giving
the
shipper
the
cheapest
route.
that
is
a
traditional
misrouting
case
in
the
common
law.
the
question
here
is
whether
or
not
the
motor
carrier
act
abolished
such
action.
we
contend
that
it
did
not.
we
see
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
for
the
motor
carrier
act.
we
see
nothing
in
the
act
itself
that
proscribes
an
action
for
motor
carrier
misrouting.
it
is
a
simple
wrong
that
was
committed
by
the
motor
carrier
for
which
it
should
respond
in
damages
to
the
shipper.
mr.
harry
teichner
in
this
case,
we
would
not
have
an
action
your
honor.
however,
there
are
actions
for
misrouting
where
it
is
not
necessary
to
resort
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
an
administrative
finding
at
all
and
where
it
is
within
the
competence
of
the
court
to
decide
all
the
issues
on
the
case
and
such
would
be
such
action.
mr.
harry
teichner
that
is
true
sir.
mr.
harry
teichner
under
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction
your
honor,
i
had
to
go
to
the
commission
for
the
reason
that
the
carrier
was
contending
that
the
route
over
the
intrastate
line
was
an
unreasonable
one
and
that
of
course
presented
a
question
for
administrative
adjudication
for
the
sake
of
uniformity
and
the
expertise
of
the
commission
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
route
was
an
unreasonable
one.
however,
there
are
numerous
misroute
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
harry
teichner
that
will
be
decided
your
honor.
mr.
harry
teichner
it
will
be
decided
your
honor.
mr.
harry
teichner
well,
the
jersey
court
was
asked
to
hold
in
abeyance
its
decision
until
this
court
decides
this
matter
because
there
too,
the
question
arises
as
to
whether
or
not
the
interstate
commerce
commission
has
any
jurisdiction
on
the
matter.
and
of
course,
if
it
should
be
found
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
does
not
have
jurisdiction
then
the
united
states
and
interstate
commerce
commission
will
fail
in
that
case
and
the
order
of
the
commission
will
be
annulled.
now,
there
are
cases
of
misrouting
where
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
to
go
to
the
commission
for
an
administrative
finding
and
this
would
be
a
case
of
that
kind.
let
us
assume
that
a
carrier
has
two
routes
between
the
same
points,
one
is
a
higher
rated
route
than
the
other
one
and
the
motor
carrier
thereupon,
transports
the
shipment
over
the
higher
rated
route,
and
a
suit
is
instituted
to
recover
damages.
if
there
is
no
question
at
all
about
the
reasonableness
of
the
intrastate
route
or
the
lower
rated
route,
then
of
course
there
is
no
question
at
all
to
present
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
court
in
which
the
action
is
brought
may
determine
all
the
issues
on
the
case,
and
we
then
have
a
simple
common
law
case.
that
is
one
the
differences
between
a
case
of
a
misrouting
and
a
case
where
rates
are
attacked
as
being
intrinsically
unreasonable.
in
the
latter
case,
it
is
necessary
at
all
times
to
refer
the
matter
of
reasonableness
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
however,
in
a
case
of
motor
carrier
misrouting
or
rail
carrier
misrouting,
there
is
no
necessity
of
referring
the
matter
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
case
no
issue
is
raised
with
respect
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
lower
rated
route.
now,
one
of
the
factors
for
example
that
may
be
involved
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
lower
rated
route
is
reasonable
would
be
road
conditions,
whether
the
route
conditions
are
such,
that
we
cannot
reasonably
expect
a
carrier
to
transport
the
shipment
over
such
route.
absent
such
question,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
would
not
be
resorted
to
at
all.
that
is
one
of
the
differences
between
misrouting
and
the
t.i.m.e.
case
which
involved
merely
intrinsic
unreasonableness
of
rates.
now,
there
is
another
distinction
and
it
is
this.
in
the
t.i.m.e.
case,
this
court
held
that
a
shipper
has
a
built-in
protection
granted
it
by
the
motor
carrier
act
with
respect
to
the
reasonableness
of
rates.
it
is
incumbent
upon
an
interstate
motor
carrier
to
file
a
tariff
of
its
rates
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
as
soon
as
the
carrier
does
so,
any
member
of
the
shipping
public
can
come
in
and
attack
those
rates
and
say
that
they
are
unreasonable
and
they
prove
that
they
are
unreasonable.
in
other
words,
the
shipper
is
not
precluded
from
attacking
the
rates.
he
has
a
right
to
do
so
immediately
upon
their
filing.
what
the
t.i.m.e.
says
is
that
the
motor
carrier
act
told
the
shipper,
if
you
have
any
question
with
respect
to
reasonableness
of
rates,
don’t
come
in,
post
shipment,
come
in
at
once
as
soon
as
that
rate
is
filed
and
contest
its
validity
and
its
reasonableness
--
mr.
harry
teichner
well
--
mr.
harry
teichner
well,
i
believe
your
honor
that
that
was
the
set
--
the
only
question
involved
in
the
case,
the
reasonableness
of
rates.
mr.
harry
teichner
yes
sir
and
we
feel
that
the
decision
should
be
confined
to
its
own
facts.
with
respect
to
misrouting,
a
shipper
is
at
the
mercy
of
a
carrier
because
he
never
knows
whether
or
not
when
he
delivers
a
shipment
of
goods
to
a
carrier
whether
the
carrier
is
going
to
misroute
or
not.
he
never
gets
advance
notice
of
it.
so
that
he
is
really
at
the
mercy
of
the
motor
carrier.
he
doesn’t
have
an
opportunity
to
attack
the
practice
before
the
practice
is
put
into
effect
as
a
shipper
has
in
a
case
the
rates.
in
the
case
of
rates,
he
comes
in
immediately
and
says,
“this
rate
is
unreasonable,”
but
with
respect
to
misrouting,
he
knows
whether
or
not
there's
going
to
be
any
misrouting.
mr.
harry
teichner
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
harry
teichner
no,
not
in
motor
carrier
practice,
sir.
mr.
harry
teichner
he
has
no
right
at
all
to
route
a
motor
carrier
shipment.
that
differs
from
rail
shipments
your
honor.
in
rail
shipments,
a
shipper
has
a
right
to
say,
"i
want
this
shipment
to
move
via
this
line,
this
line,
and
this
line
over
such
and
such
route."
mr.
harry
teichner
yes
sir.
mr.
harry
teichner
oh,
the
cheapest
route,
that
is
--
mr.
harry
teichner
well,
under
common
law
he
is
entitled
to
have
the
cheapest
route,
but
he
has
no
right
to
say
to
the
carrier,
"i
want
you
to
ship
via
this
route."
he
cannot
do
that
as
in
the
case
of
rail
carriers.
mr.
harry
teichner
no,
sir.
there's
no
way
at
all
that
the
commission
has
of
awarding
damages
for
unreasonable
rates,
misrouting
or
anyway
at
all.
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
one
that
is
injured
to
bring
a
suit
in
a
district
court
or
the
state
court
having
jurisdiction
and
if
it
is
one
of
those
cases
of
misrouting
where
the
administrative
question
of
reasonableness
comes
into
play,
the
reasonableness
of
the
route,
then
under
the
doctrine
of
primary
jurisdiction,
the
court
will
hold
in
abeyance
its
decision
and
refer
to
the
commission
the
issue
that
must
be
determined
by
the
commission
as
an
aid
to
the
court
in
finally
deciding
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
judgment.
mr.
harry
teichner
--
your
honor
i
have
concluded
my
argument.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
harry
teichner
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
was
the
concluding
paragraph
of
the
majority
opinion
in
t.i.m.e.
which
adverted
to
the
malice
we
have
just
discussed
whether
or
not
the
shipper
would
have
a
right
to
attack
the
rate
as
being
unreasonable
anti
shipment
and
at
the
time
when
the
rate
was
first
proposed
to
be
put
into
effect.
with
respect
to
this
matter
as
to
whether
or
not,
a
shipper
by
motor
carrier
has
a
right
to
designate
the
route.
i
would
invite
the
attention
of
the
court
to
section
15,
subdivision
8
of
part
one
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
mr.
harry
teichner
no
sir
it
is
not.
that
is
an
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
inquiries
to
whether
or
not
there's
any
authority
for
this
proposition.
mr.
harry
teichner
its
section
15,
subdivision
8
of
part
one
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
provides
that
with
respect
rail
carriers,
a
shipper
may
designate
the
route
and
that
it
would
unlawful
for
the
rail
carriers
to
deviate
from
such
route.
now,
there
is
no
such
--
no
counterpart
of
that
provision
in
part
two
with
respect
to
motor
carriers.
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
its
decision
in
the
case
that
we
have
at
bar
stated
the
following,
“misrouting
is
an
unreasonable
practice
violative
of
the
provisions
of
section
216
(b)
of
the
act.
and
while
a
motor
carrier
must
under
section
217
(b)
of
the
act
observe
its
tariff
rates
over
the
route
of
movement,
it
also
must
observe
just
and
reasonable
routing
practices.”
this
duty
is
not
affected
by
the
absence
from
part
two
of
the
act
of
any
specific
grant
to
shippers
of
the
right
to
designate
routes
by
which
their
property
shall
be
transported.
when
no
routing
instructions
are
given,
a
motor
carrier
has
a
duty
to
select
the
least
expensive
route
unless
it
is
an
unreasonable
one,

in
other
words,
--
mr.
harry
teichner
i
was
reading
from
the
decision
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
teichner
yes
sir.
in
our
review
of
robins'
case,
302
icc,
173.
in
other
words,
we
have
in
part
two
a
specific
grant
to
a
shipper
of
a
right
to
route
his
own
shipments
and
to
that
direction
must
be
observed
and
obeyed
by
the
rail
carrier.
and
as
the
icc
points
out,
part
two
of
the
act
does
not
give
such
specific
grant
to
a
shipper
by
motor
carrier,
the
inference
being
that
under
those
circumstances,
a
shipper
by
motor
carrier
would
not
have
a
right
to
specifically
route
a
shipment
with
respect
to
movements
by
motor
vehicle.
mr.
harry
teichner
i
would
like
to
submit
something
your
honor.
mr.
harry
teichner
and
to
clarify
--
mr.
harry
teichner
thank
you.
