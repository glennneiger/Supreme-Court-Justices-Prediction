i
think
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
might
be
interested
in
knowing
that
as
a
fact,
perhaps
both
of
you
within
the
next
day
or
so
can
give
us
a
memorandum
on
it,
can
you?

the
question
--
the
question
as
to
whether

earl
warren
--
has
a
right
to
designate
the
route
that
he
is
to

his
commodities
should
be
shipped
on?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
it
follow
from
what
you
have
said
that
the
carrier
may
select
any
route
that
he
wants
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
regardless
of
whether
it’s
cheaper
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
that
an
--
was
that
a
trucking
affair
or
was
that
railroads,
in
that
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
no
difference
between
the
statutes
as
--
between
the
two
types
of
carriers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
on
that
score
--
i
mean
on
that
score
--
particular
score.

justice
earl
warren

you’ve
just
been
talking
about?

justice
earl
warren

skip
it.

justice
earl
warren

chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
if
you
wish
if
you
don't
--

more,

not
necessary.
