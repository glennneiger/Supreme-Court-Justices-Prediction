if
you
shouldn’t
prevail
here,
what
happens
to
that
new
jersey
one,
a
suit
pending
in
new
jersey
district
court,
it
doesn’t
have
to
be
decided
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
to
be
decided
anyway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
new
jersey
court
to
gain
by
holding
it
up
until
they
hear
from
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

but
may
the
shipper
direct
the
route?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
the
shipper
direct
the
carrier
to
take
a
particular
route
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wouldn’t
suppose
it
was
a
practice,
i
just
wondered
whether
a
shipper
might
say,
"i
want
you
to
go
by
the
intrastate
rather
than
the
interstate."
