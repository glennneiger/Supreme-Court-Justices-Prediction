i
think
(g).
justice
john
m.
harlan
at
some
point
i
wish
you
would
come
back
to
the
small
exchange
we
had
and
tell
me
why
you
think
(g)
is
red
herring?
justice
john
m.
harlan
yeah,
i
know
but
(g)
certainly
shows
apart
from
the
arguments
you
are
making
that
the
act
was
intended
to
cover
the
waterfront
as
one
would
suppose,
congress
would
do
an
important
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
this
all
comes
down
to
as
i
understand
it.
you
are
both
in
agreement
with
each
other
that
the
act
can
be
read
either
one
of
two
ways.
justice
john
m.
harlan
aren't
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
what
you
answered
mr.
justice
black
indicated
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that
means
that
you
can
read
the
act
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
can
read
the
act
the
way
they
do.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
this
in
your
brief?
