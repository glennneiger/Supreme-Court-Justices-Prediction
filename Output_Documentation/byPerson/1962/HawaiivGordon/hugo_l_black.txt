justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
since
this
controversy
occurred,
any
effort
has
been
made
to
secure
congressional
action
of
any
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
lands
are
given
away?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
mr.
barnett,
i'm
not
sure
that
is
in
history.
is
any
history
in
this
country
in
connection
with
that
thought
that
you
have
now,
when
states
have
condemned
property
heretofore
for
public
use,
what
has
happened
to
the
property
when
they
cease
to
use
it
for
that
purpose
in
the
maine
and
is
there
any
history
in
connection
with
federal
condemnation
in
that
field.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
you
then
you
go.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand
you,
therefore
the
government
has
bought
property
for
use
for
military
installation
or
for
a
post
office
or
for
something
of
that
kind,
it
has
always
owned
that
property,
absolutely
and
to
dispose
of
it
even
though
the
property
cease
to
be
used
for
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
purchased?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
recall
we've
had
some
cases
that
perhaps
the
reason
the
authority
did,
railroad,
we
had
one
case
in
particular,
the
problem
was
who
the
title
would
go
back
to
if
the
railroad
cease
to
use
its
property
for
a
railroad
that
was
quite
a
question,
problem?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
this
was
not
a
united
states
case.
this
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
came
to
us
from
illinois
where
they
were
[inaudible]
some
oil
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
right
of
way.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
the
history
and
connection
with
the
state
condemnation
than
purchases
of
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
do
any
of
the
other
states,
have
any
of
them
had
an
agreement
of
this
kind?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes
i
understand.
i
just
wondered
if
this
would
have
repercussions
in
connection
with
land
in
other
states
such
as
alaska
or
other
states
have
been
admitted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
we
correct
in
assuming
the
only
consequences
of
this
lawsuit
relate
to
whether
the
land
the
government
doesn't
need
in
hawaii,
it
gives
up
because
it
doesn't
need
it.
and
the
value
of
that
land
will
go
to
the
state
of
hawaii
instead
of
stay
in
the
treasury
of
united
states?
justice
hugo
l.
black
part
of
that
–-
justice
hugo
l.
black
about
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
this
is
a
lawsuit
of
over
$15
million
to
$20
million,
if
that's
about
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
title
of
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
agreeing
that
literally
that
congress
has
agreed
to
what
they
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
state
indicated
what
it
wants
this
property
for?
you
have
to
sell
it,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
state
public
housing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
right
if
you
read
the
language
literally.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
using
your
shoe
example?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
say,
it's
the
same
as
if
a
man
goes
into
the
store
in
your
shoe
illustration
and
says
i
want
to
get
to
use
those
shoes
while
i
need
them,
what
do
you
charge
me
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
a
sale
or
would
that
be
a
transfer
too?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
indicates
that
there
is
some
little
doubt
about
definition
of
use.
