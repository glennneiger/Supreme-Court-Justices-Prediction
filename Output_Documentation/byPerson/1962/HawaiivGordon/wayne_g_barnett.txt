mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
my
argument
like
the
state's
will
be
limited
to
the
question
on
the
merits,
the
interpretation
of
the
statehood
act.
i
don't
mean
by
any
means
to
waive
our
sovereign
in
defense,
but
that
question
is
near
to
the
court
and
you
recently
had
occasion
to
consider
it
and
i
think
i
can
help
you
more,
if
i
devote
myself
to
try
to
unravel
the
statehood
act.
i
also
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
if
the
court
does
agree
with
the
united
states
or
with
the
defendant,
on
the
merits,
would
be
proper
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action
without
passing
on
the
jurisdictional
questions.
the
court
has
done
that
on
a
number
of
occasions.
unfortunately,
we
didn't
cite
the
cases
in
our
brief,
but
i
have
supplied
the
clerk
with
a
lists
of
such
cases,
which
will
be
available
if
the
court
should
request
it.
as
background
to
the
interpretation
to
the
statehood
act,
i
want
briefly
to
summarize
the
nature
of
the
land
holding
in
hawaii,
the
governmental
land
holdings
in
hawaii
at
the
time
of
the
statehood
act.
the
first
major
category
with
the
ceded
lands,
which
were
given
to
the
united
states
on
annexation
by
the
republic
of
hawaii.
those
were
initially
governed
by
the
joint
resolution
of
annexation,
which
appears
at
page
20
of
the
appendix
to
the
complaint.
that
gave
united
states
title,
however
it
provided
that
the
ceded
lands
were
not
to
be
governed
by
the
general
land
laws
of
the
united
states
and
rather
that
except
for
such
part
of
the
lands
as
were
used
or
occupied
by
the
united
states
for
civil
or
military
purposes,
the
lands
would
be
used
solely
for
the
benefit
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
hawaiian
islands.
now
that
created
the
trust
concept
and
that
undertaking
was
carried
out
two
years
later
in
the
hawaiian
organic
act,
which
of
course
was
the
basic
charter
created
in
the
territorial
government.
the
provision
concerning
the
control
of
the
ceded
property
is
section
91
of
the
organic
act.
and
that
section
is
in
the
government's
case
is
central
point
and
we
think
it
is
the
key
to
an
understanding
of
the
statehood
act.
it
appears
at
page
63
of
the
government's
brief.
the
first
sentence
i
would
like
to
read
part
of
it,
provides
that
the
property
that
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
the
republic
of
hawaii
shall
remain
in
the
possession,
use
and
control
of
the
territory.
until
otherwise
provided
for
by
congress
or
taken
for
the
uses
and
purposes
of
the
united
states
by
direction
of
the
president
or
of
the
governor
of
hawaii.
now
that
provision
thus
gave
hawaii
the
territory
possession
of
the
all
the
ceded
properties
subject
only
to
the
power
to
withdraw
specific
parcels
for
federal
use.
they
could
be
withdrawn
under
91,
section
91
of
the
organic
act
by
act
of
congress,
by
direction
of
the
president
or
by
direction
of
the
governor
of
hawaii,
and
that
as
we
will
later
show
is
the
direct
antecedent
of
section,
subsection
(c)
of
the
land
grant
provisions.
i
would
also
like
to
note
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
sentence,
because
that
we
will
also
show
is
the
antecedent
to
section
--
subsection
(e).
that
provided
that
any
such
public
property
so
taken
for
the
uses
and
purposes
of
the
untied
states
maybe
restored
to
its
previous
status
by
direction
of
the
president.
that
is
to
say
the
president
could
terminate
the
set
aside
or
withdrawal
of
the
land
and
return
it
to
the
possession
of
the
territory.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
these
are
the
antecedents.
i
will
show
how
(c)
and
(e)
evolved
into
their
final
form.
there
is
also
--
i
went
in
through
the
territorial
property
also
which
is
second
category,
but
my
first
category
are
the
ceded
lands
which
united
states
had
technical
title
to,
the
territory
had
possession
and
we
have
the
right
to
set
aside
specific
parcels
by
any
of
these
means
enumerated
in
section
91.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
this
simply
says
it
maybe
taken
for
a
use.
admittedly,
set
aside
language
includes
this
kind
of
withdrawal
and
i
don't
mean
to
comply
that
language
is
there.
the
second
category
of
lands
are
those
that
the
territorial
government
acquired
in
its
own
right,
with
the
territorial
revenues
that
purchased
lands
or
condemned
lands
for
its
own
public
uses.
now
in
1941,
the
outbreak
of
world
war
ii,
the
section
73
(2)
of
the
organic
act,
which
is
also
printed
in
our
appendix
was
amended
to
make
clear
that
even
those
lands
could
be
set
aside
for
federal
use
by
direction
of
the
governor
of
hawaii.
i
might
say
--
i
don't
think
it's
particularly
relevant,
that
section
does
use
the
word
set
aside.
i
don't
attach
any
imaginary
meaning
to
the
word
set
aside.
the
third
category
of
lands
probably
governmental
lands
were
those
that
the
united
states
purchased
from
private
owners
either
voluntarily
or
through
condemnation
procedures.
the
status
of
those
lands
was
exactly
the
same
as
land
purchased
in
anyplace
in
the
world
by
the
united
states.
there
is
nothing
in
the
organic
act
or
any
other
law
relating
specifically
to
hawaii
that
has
any
particular
bearing
on
the
status
of
land
the
united
states
purchased
from
private
owners.
and
as
i
say,
their
status
was
the
same
as
that
of
any
land,
any
place
else
in
the
world
that
united
states
may
have
purchased,
governed
by
the
same
rules
of
acquisition
and
disposition.
we
had
possession,
the
territory
had
no
interest
at
all.
those
are
the
three
categories,
the
ceded
land
between
the
possession
only
of
the
territory
subject
to
the
right
of
its
law,
the
territorial
lands
which
the
territory
owned
and
possessed
subject
again
to
the
right
of
withdrawal
and
the
united
states
purchase
of
properties
which
united
states
owned
outright
and
absolutely
and
possessed
solely
itself.
on
reading
the
state
of
the
act
of
the
land
grant
provisions
against
that
back
ground,
i
think
its
meaning
becomes
clear.
section
5
begins
in
page
3
of
the
state's
appendix.
now,
i
want
to
start
at
the
beginning
and
go
through
rather
than
start
at
the
end
and
work
backwards
that
the
state
does
and
i
think
that
really
makes
the
difference.
subsection
(a)
says
that
except
as
provided
in
subsection
(c),
the
state
shall
succeed
to
the
title
of
the
territory
and
those
lands
and
other
properties
in
which
the
territory
now
holds
title.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
page,
it
is
in
page
3
of
the
state's,
i
think
the
appendix.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
so
subsection
(a)
gave
to
the
state
the
territorial
properties
subject
to
the
stated
exception
as
provided
in
subsection
(c).
subsection
d
then
served
that
except
as
provided
in
subsection
(c)
and
d,
the
united
states
grants
to
the
state
of
hawaii,
the
united
states
title
to
all
the
public
lands
and
other
public
property.
now
public
lands
and
other
public
property
is
defined
is
subsection
g
as
ceded
lands.
so
these
admittedly
limited
to
the
ceded
lands.
so
taken
together,
(a)
and
(b)
gave
the
state
all
the
ceded
and
all
the
territorial
properties
subject
only
to
the
provided
exceptions,
exceptions
provided
in
subsection
(c)
and
d.
now,
so
that
point
that
we
come
to
subsection
(c)
that
provides
that
any
lands
and
other
properties
that
on
the
date
of
admission
are
set
aside
pursuant
to
law
for
the
use
of
united
states
under,
one,
any
act
of
congress,
two
executive
order,
three
proclamation
of
the
president,
four
proclamation
of
the
governor
of
hawaii
shall
remain
the
property
of
united
states.
now
what
is
--
at
least
the
primary
purpose
of
that
is
undisputed.
its
primary
purpose
is
to
carve
out
an
exception
from
the
grants
made
in
(a)
and
(b),
both
of
which
referred
subsection
(c)
as
an
exception
and
i
would
note
that
this
specifically
incorporates
the
property
set
aside
for
the
use
of
united
states
under
sections
91
and
73(q)
of
the
organic
act.
and
in
fact,
enumerates
all
the
ways
in
which
such
set
asides
might
be
affected
by
act
of
congress
or
by
correction
of
the
governor
or
the
president
of
the
united
states.
now
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
subsection
(c)
does
something
more
than
that
and
i
will
comeback
to
that.
i
want
to
go
ahead
and
complete
the
outline
of
the
act.
subsection
(d)
is
not
immediately
relevant,
but
it
has
some
bearing
in
the
development
of
the
act
in
legislative
history.
what
it
does,
subsection
(c)
related
to
land
that
were
set
aside
up
to
the
date
of
statehood.
subsection
(d)
continues
the
power
to
make
additional
set
asides
for
five
years
beyond
the
date
of
admission,
though
it
is
limited
to
ceded
lands
that
are
in
fact
in
the
possession
of
the
united
states
though
under
informal
arrangements
with
the
territory
rather
than
under
form
of
set
asides.
in
fact
it
simply
gave
the
military
five
more
years
aside
which
of
those
that
wanted
to
set
aside
which
to
allow
to
go
to
the
state.
we
come
then
to
subsection
(e),
which
is
the
focal
point
or
at
least
initially
of
the
controversy.
so
that
applies
to
any
land
or
property
that
is
retained
by
the
united
states
pursuant
to
subsections
(c)
and
(d).
now
any
property
so
retained,
the
president
is
required
to
reappraise
–
to
see
if
it
is
still
needed
for
federal
purposes.
if
he
concludes
that
is
not
needed
for
federal
purposes,
it
is
to
be
conveyed
to
the
state,
any
surplus
properties
within
that
category,
namely
lands
retained
pursuant
to
subsection
(c)
and
(d).
now
basically
the
position
of
the
government,
of
the
defendant,
i'm
representing
mr.
gordon
if
i
[inaudible]
i
hope
you
will
understand,
our
position
is
that
the
lands
retained
pursuant
(c)
are
simply
those
which
(c)
reserved
out
of
the
grants
made
in
(a)
and
(b),
namely
the
ceded
and
territorial
land
which
had
been
set
aside
and
therefore
were
reserved
by
(c)
out
of
the
grants.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
(g);
first
to
find
public
lands
have
been
ceded
and
says
that
the
term
any
land
shall
include
that.
i
shall
not
exclude
that
and
that's
quite
right.
the
reason
that
this
statute
necessarily
does
not
use
the
narrower
term
public
land
is
because
it
also
applies
to
the
territorial
lands,
which
is
not
ceded
land.
the
set
aside
--
it
is
the
knowledge
some
of
the
set
aside
properties
originated
as
territorially
purchased
property.
they
were
not
ceded
properties,
and
they
could
be
set
aside
under
73(q)
of
the
organic
act.
and
to
make
these
provision
broad
enough
to
include
such
property,
it
was
necessarily
to
use
the
language
any
land
rather
than
any
public
land.
public
land
is
a
narrower
term.
i
think
that
is
a
red
herring
in
that
issue.
the
statutes
to
begin
with
--
but
let
me
just
--
the
statutes
to
begin
with
any
land
or
any
person
is
fairly
common,
you
then
carve
down
initially
all
inclusive
categories
and
here
it
is
carved
down
initially
any
land
that
is
retained
pursuant
to
subsection
(c)
and
the
question
is
what
that
limiting
phrase
means.
now,
before
i
go
back
to
subsection
(c),
i
would
like
to
--
initially
a
question
of
interpreting
that
phrase
in
subsection
(e);
now
pursuant
to
subsection
(c)
could
mean
that
the
state
assumed
that
it
means
simply
as
declared
subsection
(c).
it's
enough
if
subsection
(c)
declares
to
retain
it.
another
meaning
and
i
think
a
more
plausible
one
is
that
pursuant
to
subjection
(c)
means
by
virtue
of
subjection
(c),
something
that
the
united
states
retained
because
of
subsection
(c)
that
it
would
have
not
have
retained
without
it
and
if
the
later
is
the
meaning,
it
does
not
include
purchased
properties
because
we
would
have
kept
purchased
properties
if
subsection
(c)
had
never
been
in
the
act.
this
is
the
reason
simply
being
that
there
was
nothing
giving
them
away,
there
is
no
need
to
have
a
provision
saying
anything
about
them
and
they
would
have
remained
our
property.
and
reading
the
reference
pursuant
to
subsection
(c)
as
a
reference
to
a
operational
provision,
it
does
not
include
purchased
property.
we
retained
the
purchased
properties
not
pursuant
to
subsection
(c),
but
by
virtue
of
the
absence
in
the
act
of
anything
giving
them
away.
that's
a
complete
answer
of
the
state's
case,
probably
even
going
back
to
the
subsection
(c).
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
by
subsection
(e),
the
basic
grant
is
of
ceded
in
territorial
properties.
the
lands
were
ceded
to
us
in
1898
and
the
lands
that
the
territory
purchased
out
of
territorial
revenues,
those
were
all
given
to
the
state.
out
of
that
grant,
we
reserved
the
properties
that
had
been
set
aside
specifically
for
federal
use.
subsection
(e)
then
says
that
you
shall
reexamine
your
need
for
those
lands
that
you
set
aside
and
convey
them
if
you
find
that
they
are
no
longer
needed.
the
whole
act
becomes
one
very
simple
unified
--
serves
one
very
simply
unified
purpose,
the
grant
of
all
the
ceded
and
all
the
territorial
properties
except
those
that
were
set
aside
and
are
found
still
to
be
needed
for
the
united
states.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
want
to
go
through
the
paragraphs
and
show
what
the
changes
are.
it
wasn't
said
explicitly
in
the
paragraphs.
the
paragraph
said
nothing
about
purchased
property.
it
was
simply
a
different
location
of
the
reservation
of
the
set
asides.
and
it's
a
change
in
the
location
of
exactly
the
same
language
of
the
set
aside
provision
on,
which
the
state
builds,
but
i
would
like
to
make
a
chronological
development
to
that
after
i
go
through
the
text
of
the
statute.
now,
but
i
will
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
will
be
enough
to
satisfy
subsection
(e)
if
you
could
find
in
subsection
(c)
simply
a
declaration
that
after
all
the
government
was
retaining
purchased
property.
it
would
be
an
unnecessary
declaration
to
have
that,
but
if
it
was
there,
i
will
agree
arguendo
that
would
bring
it
within
subsection
(e),
and
then
turn
back
to
subsection
(c)
itself,
because
i
think
i
can
show
that
it
doesn't
contain
such
a
declaration.
and
now
in
looking
at
subsection
(c),
i
first
want
to
emphasis
that
there
is
no
disagreement
about
its
operative
function.
what
it
does
independently?
independent
force
is
solely
as
an
exception
to
(a)
and
(b).
it
reserves
from
the
lands
otherwise
granted
by
(a)
and
(b)
the
ceded
and
territorial
lands,
those
that
had
been
set
aside
in
enumerated
ways,
and
that
the
only
effected
independently
has
and
that
is
agreed.
the
difference
is
that
the
state
says,
where
it
also
recites,
simply
declares
that
the
united
states
is
retaining
the
purchased
lands
unnecessarily,
but
they
didn't
have
simply
a
declaration
that
provides
a
predicate
for
the
later
operation
of
subsection
(b).
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
began
to
examine
the
precise
language
of
subsection
(c).
i
have
made
the
point
that
its
only
operative
effect
is
to
carve
out
the
exceptions
to
(a)
and
(b).
i
would
like
to
note
that
that
function
provides
a
complete
explanation
of
the
precise
choice
of
language
used
in
subsection
(c)
and
only
that
function.
subsection
(c)
talks
about
land
set
aside
pursuant
to
law
used
in
united
states
under
any
that
enumerates
four
things,
act
of
congress,
executive
order,
proclamation
of
the
president,
proclamation
of
the
governor.
(a)
rather
unusual
category
i
think
and
what
it
is
explained
by,
that
choice
of
language
is
explained
by
the
organic
act,
which
had
conferred
the
power
to
withdraw
ceded
properties
and
later
the
territorial
properties
under
the
--
by
the
enumerated
means.
and
all
–
i
don't
say
that
concludes
the
case,
but
i
do
want
to
note
that
that
function
is
a
complete
and
adequate
explanation
for
the
choice
of
words
used
in
subsection
(c).
now
the
state
also
--
state
says
that
it
--
nevertheless
they
agree
that
does
that,
but
they
it
is
also
broad
enough
to
encompass
purchased
properties
and
it
constituted
a
declaration
that
the
purchased
properties
are
to
remain
the
properties
of
united
states.
i
would
say
first
that
if
the
words
could
be
made
to
do
that,
it
remained
a
very
awkward
way
to
describe
a
purchased
property
as
the
setting
aside
pursuant
to
law
for
the
use
of
united
states
under
an
act
of
congress.
it's
a
very
cumbersome
way
to
say
property
purchased
by
the
united
states.
i
want
to
show
that
the
words
can't
be
made
to
fit
and
the
state
says
that
when
you
purchase
property
or
condemn
it,
it
is
set
aside
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
presumably
from
all
the
other
property
in
the
world.
and
that
it's
pursuant
to
law
under
an
act
of
congress,
because
federal
agent
can
buy
property
only
if
it's
been
authorized
to
do
so
by
statute.
now,
i
would
like
to
break
that
up
into
two
steps.
first,
set
aside
for
the
use
of
the
united
states,
that
phrase.
now
it
says
for
the
use
of
the
united
state
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
words
used
and
implied
were
a
transfer
of
use
and
possession,
not
a
transfer
of
title,
set
aside
the
use
of
the
property.
you
remove
it
from
the
possession
of
one
person
to
the
possession
of
another,
not
a
transfer
of
title.
now
they
try
to
get
over
that
problem
by
speaking
of
the
dedication
of
purchased
property
to
a
specific
federal
use,
you
take
it
for
defense
uses
rather
than
some
other
use
and
that
is
a
setting
apart
for
a
particular
use,
but
the
statute
doesn't
talk
about
setting
aside
for
particular
uses,
it
talks
about
setting
aside
for
the
use
of
the
united
states.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
federal
properties
--
i
am
unaware
of
any
case
in
which
under
a
state
land
grant
or
properties
purchased
by
the
united
states
from
private
persons
or
condemned
specific
parcels
have
been
given
to
the
state.
they
speak
of
alaska
as
giving
away
purchased
properties.
that
right,
they
were
purchased
from
russia
for
$7,200,000
and
they
purchased,
i
think
it
was
called
seward's
icebox,
that's
the
purchase
they
take
about
in
alaska.
those
are
the
public
domain
lands
in
alaska.
we
acquired
the
cession
of
sovereignty
and
ownership
by
a
inter-governmental
purchase,
if
you
like,
but
it's
still
a
purchase
of
a
very
different
kind
and
the
kind
of
purchase
or
condemnation
of
specific
parcels
of
land
from
private
owners
that
we
are
concerned
with
here
and
they
to
my
knowledge
have
never
been
given
to
a
state
as
upon
the
creation
of
the
state
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
--
the
surplus
prosperity
act.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir,
quite
true.
the
surplus
property
act
that
generally
governs
dispositions
not
just
hawaii
but
throughout
has
a
system
of
priorities
for
disposition
of
surplus
properties
and
some
of
them
i
think
are
given
to
states
for
specific
uses
i
think
for
schools,
hospitals,
there
are
some
provisions
to
make
specific
fortuitous
dispositions
of
surplus
property
and
those
would
equally
apply
to
hawaii,
but
only
--
that
is
the
only
kind
of
grant
ever
made
of
this
kind
of
property.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
know
the
case,
i
guess
it
would
come
back
to
the
united
states.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
know
the
case,
my
guess
would
be
it
would
comeback
to
the
united
states.
i
don't
know
what
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
sorry.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no
i
think
the
federal
land
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
were
made
to
support
the
building
the
railroads.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
i
don't
suppose
they
would
have
a
similar
question,
after
--
before
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
made
a
contribution
--
well
i
don't
still
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
no,
is
the
status
of
--
well
certainly
the
status
can
be
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
status
of
the
public
land,
the
public
lands
of
hawaii
are
very
different
any
other
state.
what
would
normally
be
the
public
lands
are
what
we
refer
to
here
as
ceded
lands.
they
were
the
public
lands
of
republic
of
hawaii,
and
they
were
given
to
the
united
states
much
in
the
same
way
as
alaska
was
ceded
to
the
united
states
by
russia.
so
really
the
parallel
there
is
between
the
ceded
lands
and
public
domain
in
alaska,
which
we
did
in
truth
as
part
of
my
purchase
in
a
very
different
sense,
but
generally
there
is
no
more
reason
why
alaska
would
have
--
i
think
hawaii
would
have
an
interest
in
surplus
military
installations
that
happened
to
be
located
in
hawaii
for
strategic
reasons
than
any
other
state.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
i
grant
you
if
this
agreement
encompasses
this
kind
of
property
there
is
a
reason
apart
from
--
i
hope
to
show
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i'm
unaware
of
any
possible
or
similar
problem
of
that
sort.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
argument,
they
make
--
the
statute
says
any
land,
rather
than
i
suppose
what
they
mean
they
should
say
any
public
land.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
doubt
that
(g)
shows
that.
i
was
just
--
first
of
all
the
definition
of
public
lands
was
first
inserted
at
the
insistence
of
the
united
states
at
the
military
department
i
think
to
make
clear
that
it
did
not
include
any
federally
purchased
property,
that's
where
the
definition
first
came
from.
now
they
added
the
qualification
through
the
definition
that
any
lands
or
properties,
includes
public
properties.
i
take
it
to
avoid
any
negative
implication,
that
if
they
defined
public
property
ceded
and
then
used
any
property
elsewhere,
it
might
be
an
implication
that,
that
excluded
public
property.
i
think
that's
all
that
(g)
says.
and
as
i
say,
in
fact
the
term
public
property
would
not
have
been
appropriate
in
these
uses.
it
had
been
a
term
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
properties
otherwise
within
(a),
namely
the
territorial
property
and
that's
why
they
don't
use
the
term
public
land
in
subsection
(c)
and
(e).
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes
sir.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
now
i'm
rather
inclined
to
think
that's
what
they
meant
to
say.
what
they
said
is
perfectly
opaque.
they
simply
say
that
any
land
means
any
land
and
we've
never
suggested
it
didn't
mean
any
land.
what
we
have
argued
is
that
the
qualifying
phrases
that
follow
that
open
ended
term
carve
it
down
to
size.
now,
whether
they
were
purposely
equivocal
or
whether
they
meant
to
answer
the
question
i
don't
know.
i
do
know
that
although
some
effort
was
made
to
have
the
senate
committee
endorse
that
interpretation,
they
refused
to
do
so
and
i
think
it
is
fair
inference
--
there
was
some
doubt
about
the
finding.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yeah,
yeah.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
they
just
said
--
they
said
we
don't
have
time.
it's
a
complex
problem
we
are
going
to
take
it
up.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
nothing
officially.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
my
understanding.
that
is
all
that
is
involved
in
the
case.
as
to
the
quantity
of
land
it
would
be,
turn
on
that,
i
don't
know,
for
housing
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
know
--
someone
has
suggested
something
$15
million,
$20
million
dollars
worth.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
but
i
don't
even
want
to
give
the
figures
since
it's
so
much
out
of
the
air,
something
on
the
order
of
$15
million
or
$20
million
is
perhaps
a
guess.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
but
that's
what
it's
about.
now
(c)
as
far
as
the
--
i
suggest
that
set
aside
from
the
use
of
united
states,
it
doesn't
--
it
can't
be
made
to
government
to
include
a
condemnation
or
act
of
purchase.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
perhaps
you
do,
i'm
confident
that
no
one
that
sat
down
to
draft
a
statute
to
talk
about
condemned
lands,
to
use
that
language.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
call
it
a
purchase
or
a
condemnation.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
not
talk
about
transferring
the
use
of
it,
i
would
talk
about
transferring
the
feasible
ownership
of
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
acquisition
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that's
right,
that's
right,
but
let
me
go
into
the
other
aspect
of
this
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
for
use.
the
other
aspect
is
the
statute
speaks
of
setting
aside
pursuant
to
law
under
any
of
the
four
means.
now
they
say
the
relevant
one
mean
is
pursuant
to
law
under
an
act
of
congress.
now
in
their
use
that
becomes
a
redundancy,
because
the
act
of
congress
they
talk
about
is
the
one
that
authorized
the
acquisition.
now,
in
our
interpretation
it
is
not
a
redundancy.
pursuant
law
is
pursuant
to
the
reserved
power
in
the
organic
act,
the
alternative
means
of
setting
things
aside
by
an
act
of
congress,
means
an
act
of
congress
setting
aside
a
specific
parcel
pursuant
to
that
reserved
power,
and
that
was
done
for
example
in
the
creation
of
the
national
park,
the
hawaii
national
park
in
the
act
of
1916
specifically
set
aside
a
large
area
of
ceded
property
for
use
as
a
national
park.
so
in
that
use
there
is
no
redundancy,
pursuant
to
law
and
pursuant
to
the
authorizing
statute
under
an
act
of
congress,
is
an
act
of
congress
which
executes
that
authority.
now
it
is
only
reading
it
that
way
that
first
category,
an
act
of
congress
occupies
the
same
function
as
the
other
three.
the
other
three
aren't
authorizing
things.
there
are
needs
of
executing
some
general
power.
now,
additionally
i
would
like
to
suggest,
under
their
supposed
literal
reading
that
this
includes
purchased
lands,
under
that
reading
literally
it
is
not
limited
to
lands
in
hawaii.
their
reading
would
equally
apply
to
property
in
the
district
of
columbia
if
there
was
surplus
and
under
their
reading
if
you
applied
it
literally
they
would
be
entitled
to
surplus
property
any
place
in
the
world.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
agree
that
we
have
no
trouble
carving
it
down
by
an
implication.
all
i
am
suggesting
that
a
literal,
a
purely
literal
reading
that
they
suggest
there
is,
creates
a
problem.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes,
but
we
say
the
–
(c)
and
(e)
are
confined
to
hawaii
because
(a)
and
(b)
are
confined
to
hawaii,
and
if
you
read
(c)
as
an
exception
to
(a)
and
(b)
you
have
no
problem.
now
we
read
it
as
so
confined
by
reading
the
language
set
aside
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress
or
direction
of
the
president
or
the
governor
as
a
specific
reference
to
the
power
granted
in
section
91
and
73(q)
of
the
organic
act.
and
it's
by
those
references
that
it
is
confined
among
other
things
to
hawaii.
the
state
esques
those
limiting
references
and
ends
up
with
an
open-ended
provision
that
they
have
to
find
some
other
way
to
carve
that
down
because
it
obviously
cannot
as
you
suggest
[inaudible]
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
they
specifically
pointed
to
four
housing
projects
which
they
say
are
--
they
would
use
as
low
cost
public
housing.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
as
i
--
i
don't
quite
know
what
the
arrangements
would
be,
but
they
want
to
use
it
as
low
cost
housing.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
they
are
housing
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
they
were
navy,
for
navy
personnel
originally.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
mean
to
be
in
agreement
with
that.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
was
just
trying
to
show
that
it
cannot
be
read
that
way.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
no,
i
agree
that
if
their
position
were
otherwise
right,
i
would
have
no
trouble
carving
it
down
to
hawaii.
i
agree
one
can
make
that
implication.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
agree
that
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
said
if
it
is
otherwise
right,
and
otherwise
is
a
big
word.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
hope
not,
no,
no.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
no,
i
say
read
it
literally.
pursuant
to
law
and
an
act
of
congress
isn't
redundancy,
as
they
read
it.
i
don't
know
how
they
make
both
phrases
sort
of
function,
because
they
say
that
a
condemnation
satisfied
this
because
it
has
to
be
authorized
by
a
statute.
now
that
makes
it
both
pursuant
to
law
and
both
under
an
act
of
congress
i
take
it.
they
satisfied
both
requirements
to
one
source
of
authority
and
that
i
think
is
an
impossibility.
and
secondly
the
statutes
speaks
set
aside
for
use
of
united
states,
which
i
say,
the
more
literal
reading
is
that
is
a
transfer
of
use.
also
they
talk
about
a
set
aside
for
a
specific
use
and
the
statute
doesn't
talk
about
set
aside
[inaudible]
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
transfer
of
ownership
includes
use,
i
agree.
i
don't
call
that
a
very
literal
reading.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
you
could
say
that
i
don't
call
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
if
congress
or
the
statute
about
paying
the
use
of
shoes,
you
would
not
read
it
as,
one
i'm
taking
about
being
title
to
shoes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
let
me
add
on
further
text
to
our
argument
that
under
their
reading
of
(c),
the
language
in
(e)
that
says
lands
retained
pursuant
to
subsection
(c)
becomes
surplusage.
they
say
that
it
applies
to
all
lands.
so
that
(e)
would
mean
the
same
thing,
and
simply
said,
lands
retained
by
the
united
states,
and
didn't
add
pursuant
to
subsection
(c).
that
phrase
performs
a
function,
it
meant
to
distinguish
lands
retained
under
(c),
as
distinguished
from
lands
otherwise
retained
and
i
say
the
lands
otherwise
retained
are
the
purchase
properties
to
retain
simply
because
they
aren't
given
away.
now
let's
go
to
another
provision
of
the
act,
16(b),
which
i
think
is
independently
a
fairly
complete
answer
to
their
argument.
that's
at
page
20
or
16
of
their
appendix.
this
is
a
reservation
by
congress
of
legislative
jurisdiction
over
certain
lands,
namely
the
lands
that
are
controlled
or
owned
by
the
united
states
held
for
defense
or
coast
guard
purposes.
then
it
says
whether
such
lands
were
acquired
by
cession
and
transfer
to
the
united
states
and
set
aside
by
act
of
congress
or
by
executive
order
or
proclamation
of
the
president
or
governor
of
hawaii,
the
same
four
things,
for
the
use
of
united
states
or
were
acquired
by
the
united
states
by
purchase
condemnation,
donation,
exchange
or
otherwise
and
it
will
be
totally
unnecessary
to
include
the
second
category
separately
if
their
interpretation
were
right.
now
i
would
like
to
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
right,
i
think
--
i
prefer
not
to
answer
that.
i
did
look
at
that
reference
once
and
was
satisfied
it
didn't
bear
on
this
problem,
but
i'm
not
sure
i
can
tell
you
why,
i
prefer
not
to
try
to
answer
it.
getting
to
the
history
which
i
think
is
finite
to
conclusive
answer;
it's
agreed
that
all
prior
bills
were
limited
to
ceded
and
territorial
lands,
but
the
85th
congress,
they
had
all
pretty
much
gotten
to
the
form
of
the
h.r.49.
it
was
introduced
in
85th
congress
by
delegate,
burns,
he
was
the
delegate
from
hawaii.
the
form
of
that
is
set
out
in
skeletal
form
at
page
47
of
the
government's
brief,
the
lands
act
provisions
in
that
bill
consisted
of
only
subsections
(a)
and
(b);
(a),
like
the
act
was
limited
to
territorial
property
and
(b)
was
limited
to
ceded
properties,
they
also
were
subject
to
the
reservation
of
set
aside,
except
that
the
reservations
were
incorporated
partly
into
the
granting
clauses
as
provisos.
so
subsection
(a)
gave
the
state
--
the
territorial
lands
provided
however
as
to
any
such
lands
or
other
property
set
aside
by
active
congress
or
by
executive
order
or
proclamation
of
the
president
or
the
governor
of
hawaii
pursuant
to
law
and
they
mainly
so
set
aside
the
united
states
shall
be
the
owner.
and
similarly
subsection
(b)
repeated
in
verbatim
the
same
proviso
now
that
was
admitted
necessarily
limited
to
those
two
types
of
land
because
it's
partly
incorporated
into
the
granting
clause.
that
bill
was
reported
out
by
the
house
committee
in
house
report
2700.
the
house
committee
kept
the
same
form
and
added
two
changes
to
subsection
(b).
they
extended
for
five
years
the
power
to
make
further
set
asides,
an
unlimited
power
for
five
more
years
to
make
set
aside
of
the
ceded
properties
and
secondly
they
added
a
second
proviso
which
appears
in
page
48
of
our
brief.
that
proviso
--
second
proviso
provided
further
that
the
provisions
of
section
91
of
the
hawaiian
organic
act
which
authorized
the
president
to
restore
to
their
previous
status
land
set
aside
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
shall
continue
in
effect
for
a
period
of
five
years.
now
that
is
the
origin
of
the
notion
that
ultimately
became
subsection
(e)
of
a
post-conveyance
reappraisal
of
our
need
for
the
set
aside
and
their
re-conveyance.
and
that
was
in
the
85th
congress,
the
committee
amendments.
now
that
did
not
pass
and
the
86th
congress,
which
is
the
one
that
in
which
the
bill
was
finally
enacted,
new
bills
were
put
into
the
hopper.
represent
--
delegate
burns
introduced
h.r.50.
i
might
say
if
anyone
is
interested
in
numbers
the
repetitive
numbers
49
and
50
reflect
the
hope
that
alaska
would
become
--
hawaii
would
become
the
49th
and
later
the
50th
state,
that's
why
the
number
keeps
recurring
number
49
in
every
congress
and
then
number
50
in
the
later
congress,
but
delegate
burns
introduced
h.r.50
in
the
85th
congress.
it
was
exactly
like
his
bill
in
the
earlier
congress,
limited
to
the
two
subsections
except
that
he
incorporated
the
committee
amendment
extending
for
five
years
the
power
to
restore.
he
omitted
the
committee
amendment
extending
for
five
years
the
power
to
make
further
set
asides.
he
just
wanted
the
provision
favor
to
hawaii
and
that
was
his
bill.
now
in
terms
of
the
appellate
equity
that
we've
heard
so
much
about,
i
find
it
rather
surprising
that
the
delegate
from
hawaii
had
no
time
ever
proposed
giving
hawaii
anything
more
than
the
ceded
and
territorial
lands,
that's
admitted.
h.r.50
was
his
bill
and
it
was
admittedly
limited
as
all
the
prior
bills
had
been.
the
other
bill
introduced
in
the
significant
is
h.r.888
that
is
the
bill
that
revised
the
format
of
the
lands
act
provisions,
introduced
in
86th
congress.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
that
is
the
important
thing;
by
mr.
o'brien,
mr.
o'brien
of
new
york.
mr.
o'brien
was
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
on
interior
and
insular
affairs.
in
fact
he
was
the
acting
chairman
of
the
full
committee
on
this
matter.
in
the
86th
congress
he
was
graciously
invited
to
chair
the
hearings
before
the
whole
committee,
because
of
his
dedication
to
the
cause
of
statehood.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
the
administration
was
four,
actually,
but
i
hope
to
prove
if
it
was
a
staff
--
it
was
drafted
by
the
staff
of
the
committee.
mr.
o'brien
most
significantly
was
the
author
of
the
committee
report
in
the
prior
congress
that
had
reported
out
h.r.49
as
amended
and
he
introduced
the
new
measure.
this
new
measure
was
described
by
the
interior
department
in
their
letter
when
they
were
asked
to
comment
on
h.r.50
and
h.r.888,
also
in
954.
954
was
identical
to
h888,
it
was
introduced
mr.
sailor
who
was
the
senior
republican
on
the
committee.
they
--
delegate,
representative
o'brien
and
representative
sailor
were
the
republican
democratic
offices,
they
introduced
companion
bill.
the
interior
department
said
this
in
their
letter;
it
is
noted
that
h.r.888
and
h.r.954
that's
mr.
sailor's
bill,
which
are
identical
bills.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
this
is
from
the
hearings
on
h.r.50
and
h.r.888
at
the
86th
congress,
first
session,
page
16,
letter
from
the
interior
department
commenting
on
the
bill.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
don't
believe
it
is,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
no,
no
it's
not.
it
is
noted
that
h.r.888
and
h.r.954
which
are
identical
bills
contain
technical
language
changes
prepared
by
your
committee
staff
with
the
cooperation
of
this
department,
while
h.r.50
appears
to
contain
provisions
of
an
earlier
bill
developed
prior
to
agreement
on
such
technical
changes.
they
describe
it
as
a
staff
rewriting.
now
i
would
like
strictly
to
compare
h.r.49
as
amended
in
the
prior
congress
and
h.r.888.
if
you
put
them
side-by-side
there
are
no
substantive
changes
unless
this
implicit
one
for
state
against
[inaudible]
now
by
the
time
the
committee
gotten
through
with
h.r.49
in
the
prior
congress,
it
was
a
very
cumbersome
complex
provision.
subsection
(b)
alone
did
these
five
things.
it
granted
to
the
state
the
ceded
properties,
it
reserved
from
that
grant,
the
ceded
properties
has
been
set
aside
enumerated
ways.
it
extended
for
five
years
the
power
to
set,
make
further
set
asides,
it
extended
for
five
years
the
president's
power
to
restore
to
set
aside
properties
and
it's
incorporated
within
itself
the
definition
of
public
lands,
all
five
things
in
one
subsection,
it
was
good
cause
to
revive
it.
now
you
can
trace
every
provision
of
h.r.49
into
h.r.888.
subsection
(a)
of
the
bill
is
enacted
in
h.r.888
was
limited
now
since
it's
granting
the
territorial
properties
without
repeating
the
proviso,
but
simply
referring
except
as
provided
in
subsection
(c);
(b)
get
the
same
thing
for
the
ceded
property;
(c)
is
where
the
reservation
of
set
asides
was
put,
d
is
where
they
put
the
continuation
for
five
years
of
empowering
to
make
further
set
asides
and
h.r.888
but
that
was
unlimited,
that
was
a
wide
open
provision.
and
(e)
is
where
they
put
the
continuation
of
the
power
to
make
to
restore
unneeded
set
aside
and
the
definition
was
put
in
the
(g).
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
think
this
time
i
can
have
my
cake
and
eat
it.
after
saying
that
was
the
opening
sentence,
later
on
in
the
interiors
letter,
they
came
to
section
5
and
they
noted
that
the
provision
for
further
set
aside
was
totally
unlimited
5(d)
and
a
couple
of
other
aspects
related
to
that
and
their
letter
says
this.
we
understand
that
these
provisions
were
drafted
after
consultation
with
the
department
of
defense
and
we
shall
therefore
not
comment
on
their
detail,
but
they
go
on
to
say,
i
think
there
are
some
limit
on
one
of
the
other
provisions
and
it
shouldn't
be
quite
so
open
ended.
all
the
evidence
is
that
this
was
the
land
provision
was
defense
department's
concern
not
interior's
concern.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh,
yes.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
that
was
their
primary
concern,
but
none
of
them
suggested
that
the
purchased
properties
would
ever
be
given
to
the
state.
in
the
prior
congress
when
the
definition
of
public
lands
wasn't
in
the
bill,
it
was
added
specifically
i
think
it
was
just
--
to
make
perfectly
clear
that
the
purchased
lands
were
not
to
be
given.
and
i
think
throughout
military
department
has
been
--
this
department
has
been
the
agency
primarily
concerned
with
the
form
of
these
lands,
interior
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
oh
yes
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
i'm
not
sure
that's
right.
i'm
not
quite
clear
what
happens
to
the
proceeds
of
sale
where
they
go
back
to
the
defense
appropriations
or
not.
i'm
not
--
certainly
they
don't
have
the
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
just
don't
know
if
that's
possible.
i
don't
really
have
any
particular
idea
about
it,
but
let
me
go
on,
because
i
think
it
gets
more
conclusive
all
the
time.
finally,
if
you
simply
put
side-by-side
the
house
committee's
report
at
the
prior
congress
on
h.r.49
and
its
report,
the
committee
report
on
the
bill
as
openly
enacted,
you
will
find
that
they
are
substantially
identical
in
language.
they
simply
took
the
report
of
the
prior
committee
and
hatched
it
up
to
reflect
the
change,
the
main
change
that
they
made
was
to
limit
the
five
year
period,
the
right
to
make
further
set
asides
for
five
years
to
the
properties
that
the
military
was
already
in
possession
of
under
informal
arrangements,
that
was
the
main
change.
now
that
was
the
main
difference
between
mr.
burns'
bill
and
the
committee's
bill
h.r.888
and
that
difference
was
pointed
during
the
hearings
of
mr.
burns
pressed
the
defense
department
whether
they
needed
that
open
ended
provision
and
they
acknowledged
that
all
they
really
needed
was
the
authority
as
to
the
lands
they
were
occupying
already
under
permit
and
so
that
provision
is
appropriately
carved
down.
during
the
hearings
which
were
chaired
by
mr.
o'brien,
there
was
never
a
suggestion
that
the
bill
differ
in
this
respect
and
it
was
comparative
hearing
between
the
two
bills,
and
there
was
no
suggestion
to
the
difference.
the
committee
reports
are
virtually
identical
in
the
prior
congress
and
this
congress
and
there
the
state
says
the
change
occurred.
there
is
not
a
word
in
committee
reports
to
suggest
the
change
and
in
fact
what
is
in
the
committee
reports,
i
think
quite
conclusively
shows
that
the
bill
was
still
limited
to
ceded
and
territorial
properties.
the
community
report
and
this
is
identical
in
the
senate
report
and
the
house
report,
this
is
a
report
on
the
final
bill.
when
hawaii
was
annexed
in
1898
the
crown
lands
of
the
former
monarchy
and
the
government
and
the
government
lands
became
federal
lands.
through
the
years
some
of
these
have
been
set
aside
for
special
purposes.
the
territory
has
administered
the
public
lands
except
federal
reservations
for
the
united
states
annexation.
section
5
of
the
bill
provides
and
this
is
on
the
specific
provision
that
the
state
of
hawaii
shall
succeed
to
the
title
now
held
by
the
territory
to
most
of
the
remaining
ceded
lands
and
the
state
points
out
that
that
is
technically
inaccurate,
the
state
didn't
have
titles
of
ceded
lands,
the
united
states
had
technical
title,
the
territory
had
possession.
we
acknowledge
that
that
is
right.
that
doesn't
detract
from
the
substance
of
what
the
committee
is
saying.
the
state
shall
succeed
of
the
territory
--
of
the
territory
in
the
remaining
ceded
lands
saving
to
the
united
states
title
to
all
the
lands
set
aside
for
public
use
under
act
of
congress,
executive
orders
or
presidential
or
governor
proclamations.
that's
all
it
says
about
subsection
(b)
and
(c).
then
it
says
further
down,
this
is
in
our
brief
by
the
way,
to
the
end
of
the
legislative
history,
it's
on
page
55
and
56
of
that
much.
then
further
down
the
bill
also
retains
in
effect
president's
authority
to
restore
lands
to
their
previous
status
after
admission,
that
is
how
they
described
(e).
they
describe
(e)
in
terms
of
the
old,
the
original
idea
of
extending
that
power
under
the
organic
act
for
five
years.
the
power
to
restore
lands
to
their
previous
status
that
was
the
language
of
the
organic
act
and
of
the
proviso
to
the
bill
in
the
prior
congress
and
that's
all
they
thought
of
(e)
as
doing
and
therefore
is
necessarily
be
limited
to
the
lands
governed
by
the
organic
act.
i
think
--
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
yes,
there
is
something
--
again,
let
me
say
the
--
no
one
has
a
very
clear
idea
of
what
title
was,
everything
is
little
confusing.
in
the
appendix
of
the
state,
page
65
and
66,
this
is
in
the
house.
in
the
senate,
there
was
one
simple
statement
which
has
no
light
at
all.
this
does
bear
on
it.
there
is
some
confusion
there,
i
think
it
fairly
--
it's
fairly
clear
to
me
what
it
means.
i'm
not
sure
i
can
persuade
you
about
it.
there
was
a
question;
they
were
asked
about
the
–
mr.
aspinall
--
mr.
gross
just
asked
about,
that
the
president's
power
to
dispose
the
property
within
five
years
and
mr.
aspinall
explained
it,
and
further
down
mr.
sailor
interrupts
at
the
middle
of
the
page
and
says,
“i
should
like
to
call
attention
of
the
members
of
the
house
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
land
in
hawaii
comes
in
two
classes,”
and
first
say
there
are
three
class.
“first,
those
to
which
the
federal
government
has
titled
and
fee.”
i
think
what
he
means
by
that
is
the
purchase
of
property.
that
is
the
way
it
spoken
up
in
the
military
department,
property
we
purchased
and
no
one
thinks
that
the
ceded
land
things
we
own
in
(c),
we
have
technical
title
but
only
the
right
of
use
under
the
set
aside
power,
those
to
which
the
federal
government
has
title
and
fee,
those
are
not
affected
at
all
by
this
bill.
if
i'm
right
about
putting
in
the
first
sense,
he
specifically
declares
those
not
affected
at
all
by
this
bill.
mr.
sailor
by
the
way
was
the
senior
republican
on
the
committee
introduced
the
companion
bill
and
introduced
a
companion
–
the
written
bill
at
the
end
on
it,
and
so
he
is
relatively
authoritative.
now
further
down
mr.
gross
asked
why
should
they
--
the
grant
of
the
state
not
come
--
why
shouldn't
the
state
come
to
the
congress
for
the
disposal
land,
rather
than
letting
the
president
have
the
authority
and
mr.
aspinall
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
committee
says,
“those
territories
are
in
reality
properties
of
the
territory
of
hawaii
and
that's
certainly
is
true
only
of
a
ceded
in
territorial
land.

“our
provision
provides
that
the
area
is
now
held
by
the
united
states
one
purpose
or
another,
maybe--”
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
“maybe
held
by
the
federal
government
for
an
additional
period,
but
not
over
five
years
for
determination
as
to
how
much
of
that
is
needed
permanently
for
the
federal
government.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well
i
–
i
didn't
–
because
of
these
ambiguities,
i
don't
think
we
can
make
an
awful
lot
of
it.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
all
right,
i'll
accept
that.
mr.
justice
brennan?
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would,
the
thing
it
seems
to
us
--
the
purpose
of
this
never
changed
from
the
original
bills
through
to
the
final
bill.
it
was
always
to
give
hawaii
the
ceded
and
territorial
lands
subject
only
the
reservation
of
the
set
aside
if
they
were
found
and
felt
to
be
needed
and
that
is
the
only
purpose
of
the
bill
and
subsection
(e)
is
so
limited.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
i
would
say
it's
crystal
clear,
i
--
the
difficulties
of
--
sir,
let
me
say
it's
always
difficult
when
a
statute
is
drafted
as
an
exception
from
an
exception
which
is
what
(e)
is;
(c)
is
an
exception
is
made
in
(b)
and
(b)
is
an
exception
from
(c),
and
that
always
creates
ambiguity,
but
in
this
case,
i
think
the
problems
of
reading
the
statute
the
way
that
the
state
reads
is
insurmountable.
mr.
wayne
g.
barnett
well,
the
--
i
don't
know.
the
equities
get
very
hard
to
trace
some
sort
of
thing,
there
were
benefits
for
the
territory,
they
come
in
a
territory
of
the
united
states
and
many
[inaudible]
exerted
absolute
ownership
of
the
land.
now
we
didn't.
we
took
them
basically
trust
of
the
hawaiian
people
subject
only
to
the
right
to
appropriate
what
was
specifically
needed
for
military
and
civil
purposes.
now,
over
the
years
the
president
--
the
presence
of
the
military
in
hawaii
has
been
one
of
the
major
industries
in
hawaii,
and
has
contributed
a
great
deal
to
the
hawaiian
economy.
it's
not
been
a
one
way
street
and
basically
the
ceded
land
seemed
to
be
in
the
category
generally
of
the
public
domain
and
other
contexts,
except
that
we
happen
to
acquire
them
in
this
way
rather
than
by
purchase
from
foreign
sovereign
as
alaska
and
i
don't
know
where
one
gets
with
the
equity.
i
find
them
too
difficult
to
trace
through.
i
would
add
to
that
argument
if
this
is
replaced
with
the
ceded
land
that
we
took
it's
rather
surprising
that
it
wasn't
incorporate
into
the
trust
provision
of
subsection
(f),
which
does
apply
to
ceded
land,
they
are
held
for
specific
limited
purposes
by
the
state
of
hawaii,
and
if
the
purpose
of
this
was
to
replenish
the
fund
that
we
had
diminished
by
taking
away
ceded
property,
presumably
we
would
have
paid
it
back
in
the
same
category
that
the
land
we
took
now.
i
don't
think
that
proves
an
awful
lot,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can
answer
this
case
only
working
through
the
language
of
statute
and
the
history
and
i
don't
think
equities
are
really
going
to
help.
