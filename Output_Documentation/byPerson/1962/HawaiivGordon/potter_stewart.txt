yes.
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
statehood
act
with
respect
to
that
land.
justice
potter
stewart
the
history
is
a
bit
different,
alaska
was
purchased
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
hawaii
was
an
independent
--
justice
potter
stewart
an
extra
agreement
by
the
request
of
the
party
here
at
least
by
agreement
--
justice
potter
stewart
(a)
mutual
agreement.
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
it
sure
â€“
are
you
implying
that
there
was
something
overreached
and
that
this
was
wrong
right
from
the
beginning,
this
was
a
taking
of
property
without,
in
a
wrongful
way.
justice
potter
stewart
and
will
be
retained
as
you
concede
under
the
statehood
act
that
that
part
of
it
which
is
found
to
be
necessary
for
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lyons
you
say
you
were
relying
on
the
plain
language
of
subsection
(c).
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
the
phrase
set
aside
rather
a
little
less
than
plain
if
we
are
talking
about
something
which
has
been
condemned
by
and
is
owned
by
the
united
states?
justice
potter
stewart
properties
that
are
set
aside
pursuant
to
law
under
any
of
four
different
provisions,
an
act
of
congress
or
executive
order
or
presidential
proclamation
or
gubernatorial
proclamation
of
hawaii.
that
phrase
would
little
--
not
quite
consistent
with
your
argument
if
it
is
not
entirely
plain
language.
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
necessarily
refers
to
ceded
lands.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
reference
to
your
argument
in
the
attorney
general's
opinion
but
i
suppose
that's
just
responsive
to
your
argument,
rather
than
responsive
to
anybody
in
the
legislative
history.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
saying
in
fact
that
the
(c)
and
(e)
really
could
be
reenacted
--
these
two
sentences.
justice
potter
stewart
where
can
we
find
these
readily?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right.
justice
potter
stewart
acquisition?
justice
potter
stewart
when
you
go
to
a
shoe
store
you
don't
say
i'm
here
to
set
aside
a
pair
of
shoes
for
the
use
of
mr.
barnett,
you
say
i'm
here
to
buy
a
pair
of
shoes.
justice
potter
stewart
now
existing
federal
housing
projects,
aren't
they?
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
already
been
developed
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lyon's
point
was
i
think
that
this
was
lifted
right
out
of
the
alaska
statehood
act,
am
i
understanding
it
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
mr.
barnett,
as
my
brother
goldberg
suggest
the
defense
department
and
i
have
an
obvious
interest
in
being
sure
that
whatever
they
needed
or
thought
they
needed
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
they
get
that
but
they
wouldn't
have
any
concern
of
whatever
with
what
happened
to
that
property
which
they
didn't
need
and
that's
the
only
issue
here
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
and,
one
of
the
surplus
property
act,
you
think
possibly
the
proceeds
might
go
back
in
the
defense
department?
justice
potter
stewart
he
does
say
held
but
not
owned,
mr.
aspinall
--
justice
potter
stewart
so
that's
--
i
suppose
there
is
probably
not
100
million
acres
in
all
of
hawaii.
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
comparing
absolute
figures
between
the
state
bigger
even
the
texas
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
you
are
talking
about
two
different
things,
in
alaska
there
was
a
grant
to
the
new
state
of
land
which
the
united
states
purchased
from
russia
years
ago
under
secretary
of
state
seward.
here
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
the
united
states
has
ceded
to
the
new
state
of
hawaii
land
which
it
acquired
by
purchase
or
condemnation
or
otherwise
from
private
individual
land
owners.
justice
potter
stewart
the
government's
point
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
truth
comparison
between
the
two
states
is
that
the
purchased
land
in
alaska
is
the
equivalent
roughly
of
the
ceded
land
in
hawaii.
