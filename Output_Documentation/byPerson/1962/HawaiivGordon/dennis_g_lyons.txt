mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
the
hawaii
statehood
act
contains
provisions
for
the
review
and
conveyance
to
the
state
of
hawaii
of
surplus
federal
land
in
hawaii.
the
legal
question
at
bar
today
is
how
broad
are
those
provisions?
the
state
contends
that
those
provisions
cover
any
surplus
federal
land,
that
for
five
years
after
the
passage
of
statehood
act,
the
federal
government
must
review
all
its
federal
landholdings
in
hawaii
and
make
conveyances
of
those
which
are
found
to
be
surplus
to
the
state.
here
we
are
talking
primarily
about
military
lands
because
the
military
departments
are
the
largest
federal
landholders
in
the
state.
now
the
defendant
on
the
other
hand
claims
that
these
provisions
for
the
review
and
conveyance
of
surplus
land
simply
cover
the
so
called
ceded
lands
that
the
attorney
general
spoke
of,
and
the
so
called
territorial
lands.
how
did
congress
go
about
making
this
provision
for
the
review
and
conveyance
of
federal
surplus
property
in
hawaii?
it
did
this
through
the
provisions
of
sections
5(e)
and
5(c)
of
the
statehood
act,
which
are
found
on
page
4
of
the
appendix
to
our
complaint.
the
provision
which
sets
up
the
procedure
is
section
5(e).
section
5(e)
provides
and
i
quote,
“that
within
five
years
from
the
date,
hawaii
is
admitted
into
the
union,
each
federal
agency
having
control
of
any
land
or
property
that
is
retained
by
the
united
states
pursuant
to
sub
section
(c)
and
d
of
this
section
shall
report
to
the
president,
the
facts
regarding
its
continued
need
for
such
land
or
property”.
the
section
then
goes
on
to
provide
that
if
it's
determined
that
there
is
no
need
by
the
united
states
for
the
land
or
the
property
it
shall
be
conveyed
to
the
state
of
hawaii.
the
sub
sections
coverage
in
the
first
place
is
broad,
it
refers
to
any
land
or
property
that
is
retained
pursuant
to
sub-section
(c)
or
d.
we
are
not
for
the
moment
concerned
with
sub-section
d,
but
now
to
turn
to
sub-section
(c),
sub-section
(c)
in
turn
covers
and
again
i
quote,
“any
lands
and
other
properties
back
on
the
date
hawaii
is
admitted
into
the
union
are
set
aside
pursuant
to
law
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
in
certain
specified
matters
provided
in
the
section.”
as
to
these
lands
sub-section
(c)
says,
they
shall
remain
the
property
of
the
united
states,
sub-section
(e)
then
builds
on
sub-section
(c)
and
says,
that
as
to
those
lands
these
any
lands
which
are
retained
the
procedures
of
review,
screening,
and
conveyance
if
they
are
surplus
shall
operate.
sub-section
(c)
in
turn
as
we
see
uses
broad
language,
it
uses
the
words
any
lands
and
other
properties.
sub-section
g
gives
some
definitions
for
the
terms
that
are
provided
in
the
act
and
referring
to
lands
and
other
properties,
it
defines
that
simply
by
terms
of
extension,
imposes
no
limitation
whatsoever
on
the
content
of
any
lands
and
other
properties.
it
does
not
contain
any
provision
such
as
the
defendant
claims
is
implicit
in
the
act
limiting
any
lands
and
other
properties
to
the
territorial
lands
and
the
ceded
lands.
there
is
no
such
provision
in
the
act.
we
contend
that
this
broad
language
in
subsection
g
and
the
failure
of
congress
at
that
point
to
impose
any
limitation
along
with
the
fact
that
there
is
no
limitation
expressed
in
sub-section
(c)
or
in
sub-section
(e),
indicates
that
congress
intended
this
to
be
a
broad
provision
for
the
review
and
conveyance
of
federal
surplus
land
in
the
state
of
hawaii.
this
is
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
congress
to
provide
some
sort
of
recompense
to
the
state
of
hawaii
for
the
withdrawal
of
the
best
of
the
ceded
lands
over
the
years,
lands
which
from
the
very
beginning,
from
the
annexation
resolution
itself
and
shortly
there
afterwards,
were
always
conceived,
always
held
in
a
special
trust
for
the
state
of
hawaii.
it
was
as
it
recommends
for
the
withdrawal,
the
extensive
withdrawals
from
that
category
of
land
that
the
congress
made
the
provision
question.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
act
that
says
that
the
lands
which
are
subject
to
the
procedures
setup
by
the
act
or
the
termination
of
need
and
possible
conveyance
to
the
state
of
hawaii
under
subsection
(e),
must
be
lands
which
otherwise
would
be
conveyable
to
the
state
under
subsections
5(a)
or
5(b).
the
defendant,
however,
says
that
there
is
some
such
limitation
implicit
on
some
basis
in
the
act.
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
statute
which
supports
it.
we
contend
that
this
is
not
an
appropriate
case
to
make
such
an
implication,
even
if
there
were
some
basis
for
making
an
extreme
implication
of
the
sort
that
the
defendant
suggests,
if
this
were
an
ordinary
statute.
the
fact
must
be
based
that
this
is
not
an
ordinary
statute.
this
was
not
an
act
which
was
complete
and
perfectly
enacted
simply
when
congress
voted
it
and
the
president
signed
it.
there
was
another
legislative
body,
if
you
please
that
had
to
act
on
this
provision
before
it
could
become
a
law
and
go
into
full
force
and
effect.
in
subsection
7(b)
of
the
state
of
the
act,
which
is
reproduced
on
page
7
of
the
appendix,
a
provision
is
contained
which
makes
an
explicit
submission
of
a
proposition
to
the
electorate
of
hawaii.
3
reproduced
there
asks
the
electorate
of
the
state
of
hawaii
if
they
consent
to
the
land
grant
provisions
contained
in
the
act.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there
is
nothing
quite
like
this
sir,
your
honor.
we
contend
here
that
congress
had
to
tailor
something
preciously
fit
into
the
specific
needs
and
the
specific
problem
in
the
state
of
hawaii.
actually
there
is
no
other
state
that
has
the
land
history
that
hawaii
had.
the
only
other
really
authenticated
case
of
the
annexation
of
an
independent
country
by
this
country
was
when
this
country,
i
wouldn't
say
took
over,
when
this
country
and
the
(inaudible)
texas
merged
and
there
is
a
provision
there
which
provided
for
almost
immediate
statehood.
in
that
case,
that
bulk
of
the
state
lands
were
not
taken
from
texas.
and
there
was
not
this
period
of
60
years
during
which
more
and
more
land
was
drawn
for
federal
use,
which
required
a
compensating
provision
to
be
made.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
essentially,
the
issue,
that's
essentially
the
issue
your
honor,
the
question
is
whether
congress
put
into
the
statehood
act
by
implication
of
provision
of
which
descended
to
that
level,
which
descended
to
that
level
is
what
it
means,
we
contend
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
that
is
our
position
your
honor.
we
cite
numerous
cases
in
our
reply
brief
primarily
to
the
effect
that
where
an
enactment
is
submitted
for
a
popular
vote
and
popular
ratification,
that
there
is
no
room
for
the
implication
of
any
of
restriction
not
implicit
in
the
language
of
the
act
itself,
and
we
think
this
proposition
is
one
which
should
apply
to
this
statute
here.
however,
what
legislative
history
there
is,
it's
definitely
on
the
side
of
the
state
of
hawaii,
most
cogent
items
of
the
legislative
history.
the
essential
choice
that
was
made
in
drafting
this
act,
after
the
three
--
after
the
admission
of
alaska
in
1958,
there
were
three
alternative
provisions
which
for
the
first
time
put
into
the
statehood
bills,
a
provision
for
the
conveyance
of
surplus
federal
property
to
the
state.
there
are
three
of
these
forms
which
were
pending
before
the
house
of
interior
and
insular
affairs
committee.
one
simply
covered
the
ceded
lands,
provided
for
conveyance
and
surplus
ceded
lands.
the
next
covered
both
the
surplus
ceded
and
surplus
territorial
lands.
and
the
third
and
broadest
form
is
the
form
that
wound
up
in
the
act,
the
form
that
covers
any
lands.
the
house
committee
which
fixed
the
final
meeting
of
the
act
chose
the
broadest
alternative
and
it
was
this
form
that
was
enacted
into
the
statute
and
at
the
very
next
session
of
the
congress
after
this
debate
was
flushed
out,
after
this
question
came
to
the
court,
that
very
same
committee
in
reporting
to
the
congress
an
act
designed
to
implement
the
procedures
under
the
statehood
act
made
an
explicit
declaration
that
the
state's
view
of
the
act
was
the
proper
one.
we
quote
on
page
40
of
our
opening
brief,
it's
in
these
terms,
the
committee
stated
subsection
(e)
is
referenced
to
land
or
property
that
is
retained
by
the
united
states
includes
in
some
cases,
mainly
those
covered
by
subsection
(c)
all
land
whether
it
falls
within
the
definition
of
public
land
given
in
the
act
or
not.
and
i
might
add
that
the
opinion
of
the
interior
department,
which
was
the
executive
department
most
intimately
connected
with
the
affairs
of
hawaii
over
the
years,
accorded
with
the
opinion
of
the
state
upon
the
act.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
we
reproduced
that
in
our
appendix
also,
your
honor.
the
interior
department's
memorandum
is
on
page
59
commencing
in
the
appendix.
the
interior
department,
i
think
spoke
quite
cogently.
it
said,
in
the
circumstances,
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
congress
did
not
mean
precisely
what
it
said,
that
lands
including
but
not
limited
to
ceded
lands
are
subject
to
reporting
by
federal
agencies
and
possible
subsequent
conveyance
to
the
state.
the
land
subject
to
the
screening
provisions
at
the
opinion,
and
again
i
quote,
“is
also
land
acquired
by
the
united
states
by
purchase,
condemnation,
donation
or
by
any
other
means.”
and
the
interior
department
commented,
“we
must
suppose
that
congress
meant
what
it
said.”
and
that
basically
is
what
this
state
is
conveyed
here
today.
this
again
was
after
the
debate,
after
the
controversy
came
to
light
and
the
budget
bureau
i
believe
asked
for
expressions
of
opinions
from
the
various
governmental
departments,
that
were
concerned
with
the
situation
in
hawaii.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
this
was
before
the
attorney
general
spoke.
i
should
say
that
the
departments
that
only
had
an
interest
in
hawaii
as
a
landholder
took
a
contrary
opinion.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
have
intended
to
submit
that
on
the
brief
your
honor,
but
in
view
of
your
honor's
question
i
think
i
shall
say
a
very
few
words
about
it.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
if
your
honor
please,
we
intended
those
prayers
to
the
read
only
in
connection
with
the
preceding
prayers.
in
other
words,
if
the
only
basis
that
the
defendant
has
for
failing
to
convey
is
the
basis
that
it
puts
forward,
we
would
expect
that
he
convey.
but
our
position
is
not
that
we
are
seeking
any
affirmative
decree
and
we
would
want
those
prayers
to
be
read
only
in
connection
with
the
preceding
prayers.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
i
do,
because
the
defendant
may
have
some
other
basis
on
which
perhaps
these
lands
will
not
be
conveyable.
i
know
of
none
your
honor
and
it
is
a
practical
matter,
complaints
of
this
nature
seem
to
include
these
affirmative
prayers
and
these
are
passed
without
objection
generally.
for
example,
in
some
of
the
passport
cases
of
this
court
has
passed
on,
there
have
been
affirmative
prayers
for
the
issuance
of
a
passport,
whereas
the
hurdle
of
the
case
is
simply
that
the
secretary
of
state
be
enjoined
from
refusing
a
passport
on
a
particular
ground.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
would
think
we
could
then
get
a
mandamus
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
no
effort
that
has
been
organized
along
that
line
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
any
bill
to
clarify
has
been
introduced.
there
was
the
declaration
which
the
house
committee
which
authored
the
legislation
made
in
its
report
in
which
it
interpreted
in
the
act,
but
there
has
been
nothing
by
way
of
attempt
to
actually
pass
the
statute.
the
basic
position
that
the
defendant
is
taking
as
we
understand
it,
is
that
by
some
process
of
implication,
the
provisions
of
subsection
(c)
of
section
5
must
be
read
as
being
simply
exceptions
to
subsection
(a)
and
subsection
(b).
in
other
words
what
the
defendant
is
saying
is
that
subsection
(c),
operates
only
on
land,
which
is
otherwise
conveyable
under
subsections
(a)
and
(b).
the
state
as
i
say
rests
on
the
plain
language
of
subsection
(c)
and
in
subsection
(e).
in
support
of
its
contention
the
defendant
has
cited
the
legislative
history
relating
to
the
statehood
bills
that
were
considered
at
other
sessions
of
the
congress,
the
bills
that
were
considered
seriously
from
about
1950
through
1958,
which
were
not
passed.
and
it
cites
that
there
was
nothing
in
those
bills
which
did
anything
like
what
the
state
is
now
contending
final
bill
did.
and
from
this
it
seeks
to
obtain
some
support
for
its
position.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor,
that
is
another
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
your
honor
this
i
think
leads
us
directly
into
another
argument
which
the
defendant
makes
about
which
i
like
to
speak.
the
defendant
contends
that
use
of
the
words
set
aside
in
section
(c),
in
effect
is
an
indirect
or
implicit
limitation
on
the
coverage
of
section
5(c).
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
well,
that
view
was
taken
for
a
while
by
some
of
the
agencies
of
the
government,
but
the
solicitor
general's
position
now
as
i
understand
it
is
that
it
applies
both
to
the
--
only
to
the
territorial
land
and
to
the
ceded
land,
those
two
categories,
otherwise
he
is
in
trouble
with
definition
in
section
5(g).
he
contends
that,
that
language
amounts
to
a
word
of
art.
that
it
can
only
apply
to
ceded
lands
and
to
territorial
lands,
that
it
can't
apply
to
anything
else.
our
position
is
that
those
words
in
the
context
of
course
do
apply
to
territorial
and
ceded
lands,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
it's
common
ground
for
both
parties.
but
we
contend
that
they
are
broad
enough
to
apply
to
the
formal
processes
under
which
the
united
states
acquired
the
after-acquired
federal
lands,
that
is
to
the
processes
of
purchase
condemnation,
gifts,
inheritance,
the
buys
and
the
like.
more
precisely
to
the
status
of
those
lands
after
they
were
acquired
through
these
processes.
our
position
is
that
once
there
is
a
condemnation
of
land
or
a
purchase
of
land
for
a
specific
federal
purpose,
that
land
can
be
spoken
off
as
being
set
aside,
as
being
appropriated
for
that
specific
federal
purpose.
and
that,
that
wording
of
the
act
is
broad
enough
to
cover
the
processes
thereby
--
rather
the
status
resulting
after
land
was
condemned
or
purchased
by
the
united
states
for
a
specific
federal
purpose.
now
the
defendant
has
attempted
to
create
a
sort
of
myth,
a
sort
of
structure
about
the
words
set
aside
and
he
has
gone
to
some
lengths
to
do
this,
at
one
point
the
federal
attorney
general's
opinion
says
that
the
word
traced
back
to
the
1898
joint
resolution
of
congress
annexing
hawaii,
but
one
may
look
through
that
resolution
in
vain
for
the
word.
then
the
attorney
general
said
that
the
word
set
aside
has
a
very
particular
meaning
dealing
with
hawaii,
and
one
example
of
this
very
specialized
usage
of
the
words
in
connection
with
hawaii
occurs
in
section
16(b),
where
the
words
set
aside
are
used,
this
is
on
page

what
the
attorney
general
seems
to
have
overlooked
in
citing
that
as
a
specific
use
of
terminology
that
was
peculiar
to
the
state
of
hawaii,
is
that,
that
provision
is
copied
verbatim
from
the
alaska
statehood
act
which
was
passed
the
year
before.
the
next
provision
that
the
attorney
general,
pardon
me
the
solicitor
general
says
is
indicative
of
a
specialized
peculiar
restrictive
meaning
for
the
words
set
aside
is
section
91
of
the
hawaii
organic
act,
which
was
the
provision
permitting
withdrawals
of
ceded
land.
and
again
that
provision
doesn't
use
the
words
set
aside,
it
talks
about
taking
the
land
for
the
usage
and
purposes
of
the
united
states.
actually
the
same
sort
of
language
that
one
uses
in
cases
of
condemnation
and
goodly
proportion
of
the
orders
withdrawing
land
that
are
pursuant
to
section
91,
don't
use
the
word
set
aside
either,
they
use
the
word
withdrawn
or
the
words
reserved
or
the
words
taken.
again
we
are
not
saying
that
the
words
set
aside
are
inappropriate
to
describe
the
processes
whereby
the
ceded
lands
and
the
territorial
lands
were
withdrawn.
we
simply
say
that,
that
terminology
had
not
reached
the
stage
of
being
a
word
of
art,
that
it
couldn't
be
restricted
to
that
usage,
that
it
fits
just
as
well
the
situation
in
which
after
lands
are
purchased
or
condemned,
they
are
appropriated,
they
are
withdrawn,
they
are
truly
set
aside
for
a
specific
use
of
the
united
states.
and
we
cite
in
our
briefs,
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
used
the
language
set
aside
and
the
synonym
such
as
set
apart
and
appropriate
in
referring
to
the
status
of
lands
after
they
are
condemned.
there
is
a
substantial
judicial
usage
of
the
terms
along
these
lines
including
opinions
of
this
court.
another
basis
on
which
we
contend
that
the
language
of
subsection
(c)
and
of
subsection
(e)
is
not
simply
an
exception
to
the
language
of
5(a)
and
5(b).
is
the
fact
that
there
was
an
alternative
bill
before
the
house
committee,
hr
1918
it
was
styled,
which
very
clearly
attained
the
result
which
the
defendant
contends
congress
attained
in
the
statute
as
passed.
this
form
of
the
bill
was
not
chosen
by
the
house
committee
when
it
settled
the
language
of
the
act.
instead
it
chose
the
broad
form.
now
the
defendant
says
that
the
differences
are
only
editorial
changes,
that
they
are
simply
matters
of
drafting.
if
this
was
the
case,
we
must
marvel
as
we
stated
in
our
reply
brief
at
the
number
of
drafting
errors
and
drafting
problems
that
the
draftsman
made
when
he
put
to
one
side
the
version
which
clearly
accomplished
what
the
defendant
contends
for
and
drafted
the
final
form
of
the
act.
in
the
first
place
he
included
definitions
in
section
5(g)
of
the
act,
which
are
entirely
too
broad
and
entirely
unnecessary.
in
the
second
place
after
he
had
been
very
careful
in
subsection
5(d),
where
it
wasn't
even
strictly
necessary
to
be
explicit,
but
subsection
5(d)
was
simply
an
exception
to
subsection
5(b),
he
proceeded
to
leave
off
all
the
words
of
limitation,
when
he
drafted
subsection
5(c)
and
to
make
it
stand
on
its
own
feet
and
to
refer
to
any
lands
and
all
their
property.
and
there
are
number
of
other
serious
drafting
difficulties
which
are
inherent
in
the
defendant's
construction
which
we
review
in
our
brief.
the
alternative
to
the
view
that
the
state
takes
of
the
act,
is
one
which
leaves
the
gap
in
the
act,
one
which
makes
no
provision
whatsoever
for
the
surplus
federal
after-acquired
property.
one
which
just
leaves
the
matter
up
to
the
general
disposal
statutes,
which
can
put
the
property
on
the
block
for
a
sale
to
the
highest
bidder.
the
defendant's
construction
would
make
the
hawaii
statehood
act,
if
it
had
no
provision
like
section
5(c)
and
as
we
construe
5(c),
it
would
make
it
the
only
statehood
act
passed
in
this
century
which
does
not
contain
a
provision
expressly
retaining
the
federal
government's
land.
the
alaska
act
contains
a
general
retention
provision
for
the
federal
government's
land,
just
as
we
contend
that
subsection
5(c)
is.
and
there
are
broad
retention
provisions
in
all
the
other
statehood
acts
passed
by
congress
in
the
20th
century.
the
practical
alternative
as
we
have
said
is
that
the
federal
surplus
property
including
properties
which
are
a
major
portion
of
the
state's
public
housing
will
go
on
the
block.
there
may
well
be
other
surplus
lands
in
the
category
in
question,
they
would
go
on
the
block
also.
we
contend
that
congress
meant
to
compensate
the
state
of
hawaii
for
the
extensive
losses
of
its
land,
land
which
was
recognized
from
the
beginning
as
being
its
inequity,
from
these
extensive
losses
that
took
place
over
the
years.
the
only
way
it
could
do
it
was
by
giving
the
state,
the
surplus
federal
purchase
property,
we
contend
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there
is
really
nothing
of
any
consequence
in
the
hearings,
in
the
debates.
the
reports
themselves,
the
contemporaneous
reports
are
as
the
defendant
i
think
admits
imprecise.
the
only
clear
voice
in
the
legislative
history
is
the
declaration
by
the
committee
that
drafted
the
act
past
the
next
year.
we
think
that
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
he
states
that
the
--
somehow
the
house's
declaration
was
negated
by
the
fact
that
the
senate
didn't
take
the
position
on
the
matter
in
the
same
year.
the
senate
very
clearly
didn't
take
a
position
not
because
it
agreed
or
it
disagreed,
but
because
it
simply
didn't
feel
confident
to
take
a
position.
expressly
declined
to
take
one,
and
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
committee
which
fixed
on
the
form
of
the
act
was
the
house
committee.
there
are
the
ones
who
made
the
basic
decision
as
to
what
section
5
should
look
like
and
they
are
the
ones
who
gave
the
interpretation,
the
next
year.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
think
they
were
consulting
throughout
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
plain,
they
were
the
department
that
was
primarily
charged
with
territorial
affairs.
the
other
executive
departments
were
interested
only
where
their
own
specific
responsibilities
crossed
the
affairs
of
hawaii
such
as
defense
responsibilities
in
hawaii.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
that
it
did,
but
whether
precisely
the
final
form
did
or
not
i'm
just
not
certain
your
honor.
the
state
contends
that
congress
by
choosing
the
broadest
alternative
here,
intended
to
take
a
generous
approach
towards
hawaii's
land
problems
and
to
make
a
broad
disposal
of
surplus
federal
property.
the
executive
here
took
a
strange
view
and
a
restricted
--
a
constricted
view
of
that
statute.
we
believe
that
by
so
doing
the
executive
overlooked
the
clear
and
generous
intent
of
the
congress
and
in
this
suit,
we
look
to
the
court
to
restore
the
original
intent
of
congress.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it
has
the
right
to
make
the
determination
whether
it
is
needed
or
not
and
i
would
think
that
any
attempt
to
review
that
question
would
entail
the
most
serious
of
difficulties.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
there
is
no
provision
for
judicial
review
in
the
act,
it
is
not
an
act
which
sets
up
a
series
of
private
rights.
thank
you.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
may
i
please
the
court.
the
state
is
unable
to
draw
the
parallel
in
treatment
which
is
that
--
between
alaska
and
hawaii
that
the
defendant
appears
to
be
drawing
here.
the
alaska
statehood
act
which
was
passed
by
congress
just
the
year
before
the
hawaii
statehood
act
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
the
only
differences
are
where
the
act,
where
the
hawaii
act
says
hawaii,
the
alaska
act
says
alaska,
and
where
the
hawaii
act
says
republic
of
hawaii,
the
alaska
act
says
russia.
we
are
unable
to
say
that
congress
treated
hawaii
as
equitably
as
it
did
alaska
because
the
fact
remains
that
congress
gave
to
the
state
of
alaska
100
million
acres
of
purchased
land.
now
it
may
have
been
land
that
was
purchased
in
great
part
from
the
czar
rather
than
from
private
parties,
but
it
was
land
that
the
united
states
paid
a
sum
of
money
so
large
for
at
the
time
that
the
secretary
of
state
was
denounced.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
i
believe
that
provision
deals
with
the
land
that
bought
from
the
other
--
from
the
colonial
power
from
russia.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
the
situation
in
hawaii
on
the
other
hand,
was
land
that
was
taken
over
without
the
payment
of
compensation,
which
congress
and
the
attorney
general
at
once
recognized
was
held
in
a
very
peculiar
relationship
toward
the
people
of
state
of
hawaii,
it
was
held
in
trust
for
them.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes
they
were,
but
it
was
to
--
the
only
grants
of
purchased
land
that
the
united
states
could
make
in
hawaii
would
be
the
grants
such
as
we
claim
are
made
by
sections
5(c)
and
5(e)
of
the
act,
the
grants
of
the
surplus
after
acquired
property,
and
this
--
at
most
covered
30,000
acres,
most
of
which
would
never
be
declared
surplus
anyhow.
now
this
contrasts
with
the
grant
of
100
million
acres
of
purchased
land
in
the
state
of
alaska.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
right.
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
but
we
still
have
an
enormous
grants
of
purchased
land
in
the
case
of
alaska
and
if
the
defendant
is
correct
there
is
no
grant
of
purchased
land
whatsoever
in
the
state
of
hawaii,
if
we
are
correct
there
is
grants
at
the
very
most
of
30,000
acres,
very
likely
not
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes,
but
the
equities
in
both
cases
are
whether
the
united
states
paid
money
for
the
land
and
this
is
opposed
to
the
situation
in
which
the
united
states
took
hawaii's
land
without
paying
compensation
and
immediately
recognizing
that
equitably
it
belonged
to
the
people
of
hawaii.
now
i
was
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
yes
and
i
think
the
reason
where
that
falls
is
that
the
land
that
was
purchased
in
alaska
was
–
a
valuable
consideration
was
paid
for
it
by
the
government
and
there
was
never
any
acknowledgment
or
any
principle
that
land
was
held
in
trust
for
the
people
of
alaska,
quite
the
contrary
in
the
case
of
hawaii,
it
was
always
understood
that
this
land
was
held
in
a
very
special
way
for
the
people
of
hawaii.
now
the
defendant
professes
not
to
be
able
to
understand
the
uses
of
the
language
in
section
5(c)
as
comfortably
covering
the
situation
in
which
the
land
is
condemned,
i
would
like
as
an
example
of
usage
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
112
of
our
appendix,
letter
by
secretary
forrestal
to
the
attorney
general
in
connection
with
the
condemnation
of
the
lands
in
question
here.
you
will
see
scattered
throughout
that
letter
language,
the
very
same
sort
of
colloquial
language
that
is
used
in
section
5(c).
pursuant
to
the
authority
an
appropriation
contained
in
an
act
of
congress
begins,
and
a
little
later
under,
it
is
necessary
the
lands
be
acquired
by
the
united
states
of
america
under
judicial
process
for
the
use
of
aforesaid.
again
these
are
words
that
the
defendant
professes
not
to
find
comfortable
in
a
condemnation
situation.
under
the
authority
above
mentioned
that
brings
in
both
in
pursuant
to
and
the
under
an
act
of
congress.
we
contend
that
the
language
used
in
section
5(c)
certainly
is
broad
enough
up
to
cover
cases
of
condemnation
and
purchase.
the
defendant
referred
to
the
bill
as
emerging
under
the
sponsorship
of
mr.
o'
brien
and
a
similar
bill
under
that
of
mr.
aspinall.
i
should
like
to
refer
to
the
hearings
before
the
senate
at
the
time
of
1960
hawaii
omnibus
act
where
a
witness
from
the
bureau
of
the
budget
was
testifying
and
the
senate
committee
was
starting
to
talk
about
the
statement
in
the
house
report
which
endorsed
the
state's
view.
senator
jackson
says,
this
is
on
page
35
of
the
mimeographed
transcript
of
the
hearings
on
s3054
in
the
senate.
senator
jackson
says,
“what
is
the
affect
of
the
house
language?”
and
the
witness
from
the
bureau
of
the
budget
says,
“they
say
it
includes
everything
and
i
spoke
to
mr.
o'
brien
and
mr.
aspinall
and
it
was
their
recollection.
now
there
was
an
alternative
bill
before
--
mr.
dennis
g.
lyons
it
is
not
your
honor.
it's
a
newly
discovered
law
i'm
afraid
to
say.
the
defendant
says
that
the
act
as
passed
simply
evolved
from
hr50.
now
there
was
an
alternative
form
which
the
committee
rejected
before
it.
hr1918,
which
expressly
set
out
and
did
concisely
and
accurately
what
the
defendant
claims
the
final
bill
did.
what
the
draftsmen
did
was
to
reject
that
form
and
to
use
the
form
that
refers
to
any
lands
and
other
property.
in
the
final
analysis
though,
this
act
is
one
that
was
ratified
by
the
electorate
of
the
state
of
hawaii
after
being
submitted
to
them
expressly
for
ratification
on
the
land
grant
provisions.
on
that
basis
we
contend
that
it
is
entirely
inappropriate
to
go
into
the
act
in
trying
to
construct
upon
it
implicit
references
of
the
most
opaque
sort
to
section
91
of
the
statehood
--
of
the
organic
act,
which
the
act
never
cites,
to
section
73(q)
of
the
act,
which
the
act
never
cites
and
which
never
uses
the
language
anyhow.
we
think
that
the
approach,
the
mode
that
should
be
followed
in
reading
this
act
is
the
one
that
mr.
justice
holmes
once
said
that
this
is
an
act
which
has
been
adopted
by
the
people,
just
as
--
he
was
--
the
constitutional
provision
about
which
he
was
speaking
was,
and
he
said
there
the
a
popular
enactment,
this
is
[inaudible],
must
be
read
and
i
quote
“in
a
sense
most
obvious
to
the
common
understanding
at
the
time
of
its
adoption,
for
it
was
for
public
adoption
that
it
was
proposed.”
in
this
case
your
honors
the
state
stands
on
the
fair
literal
meaning
of
the
act
which
we
believe
the
most
potent
words
of
the
legislative
history
in
support.
