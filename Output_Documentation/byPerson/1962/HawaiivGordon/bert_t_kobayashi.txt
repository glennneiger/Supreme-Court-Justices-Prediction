mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
this
is
an
original
action
brought
in
this
court
by
the
state
of
hawaii
against
david
bell
former
director
of
bureau
of
budget
for
whom
kermit
gordon
the
new
director
has
been
substituted.
the
budget
director
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
administering
certain
provisions
of
the
hawaii
statehood
act.
these
are
the
provisions
setting
up
a
program
for
the
review
of
federal
need
for
retained
lands
and
properties
in
the
state
of
hawaii
and
for
the
conveyance
of
surplus,
unneeded
land
according
to
the
state.
this
court
has
granted
all
motion,
full
need
to
file
complaint
in
this
case.
this
case
is
now
before
the
court
on
cross-
motion
with
judgment
on
the
pleadings
filed
by
both
parties.
we
believe
that
the
case
is
right
for
a
decision
on
those
cross
motions.
the
immediate
practical
issue
here
involves
four
housing
projects,
which
constitutes
a
major
part
of
the
hawaii
public
housing.
the
military
department
who
controls
the
land
in
question
have
certified
that
these
lands
are
surplus
of
the
military
need.
if
our
interpretation
of
the
hawaii
statehood
act
is
correct
then
these
lands
will
be
conveyed
to
the
state
without
being
placed
under
auction
block
to
the
highest
bidder.
to
explain
the
basis
of
our
claim,
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
briefly
into
hawaiian
history.
hawaii
was
once
a
separate
independent
nation,
when
it
was
annexed
by
the
united
states
in
1898,
the
united
states
took
without
compensation,
without
payment
of
compensation,
title
to
all
the
publicly
owned
land
in
the
republic
of
hawaii.
these
lands
were
quite
expensive,
approximately
over
44%
of
the
entire
land
area
of
the
territory.
the
legal
title
to
these
extensive
lands
very
largely
remained
in
the
united
states
until
we
were
granted
statehood
in
1959.
we
have
what
the
statehood
act
called
the
public
land,
sometimes
called
ceded
land.
they
are
other
two
types
of
land
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
justice
goldberg
initially
1,773,000
acres
of
land
out
of
a
total
land
area
of
4
million
acres
of
land
in
hawaii
were
ceded
to
the
united
states.
subsequent
to
1898
and
up
to
1959
most
of
the
ceded
land
has
been
returned
to
the
state.
and
ceded
lands
are
lands
that
have
been
originally
owned
by
the
state.
presently
approximately
400,000
acres
of
land
are
being
held
as
ceded
land
by
the
united
states,
and
also
presently
approximately
30,000
acres
of
land,
which
is
the
called
the
federal
after-acquired
land
are
being
held
by
the
united
states.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
in
issue
here,
no.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
it's
presently
however
being
processed
through
the
special
provision
in
the
hawaii
statehood
act.
whatever
ceded
land
united
states
decides
that
it
does
not
need,
then
state
of
hawaii
could
receive,
but
if
the
federal
government
decides
it
needs
it,
we
still
cannot
get
it
sir.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
no
sir,
no
sir
justice
stewart.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
justice
brennan
the
total
acreage
involved
in
this
particular
type
of
land
numbers
about
30,000.
out
of
say
30,000
i
doubt
very
much
if
initially
about
1,000
would
be
involved,
but
the
total
is
30,000.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
30,000
acres.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
presently
under
the
public
housing
we
have
approximately
275
acres
involved.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
most
of
the
installations
are
all
on
ceded
land.
on
the
island
of
oahu
the
main
island
wherein
out
of
700,000
people
in
the
state
of
hawaii,
600,000
approximately
live
on
the
island.
28
major
military
installations
are
located
on
the
island
of
oahu.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
yes
sir.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
they
are
being
surveyed
now
because
they
are
on
ceded
land.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
very
few
on
purchased
lands.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
may
i
proceed?
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
there
are
two
other
types
of
lands
involved
in
this
case,
the
territorial
lands
and
the
federal
after-acquired
land.
the
territorial
lands
are
lands,
which
are
very
partly
by
transfer
by
the
united
states
received
that
is
portion
of
ceded
land
and
partly
by
purchase
of
condemnation
under
the
territory's
power
as
territorial
government.
the
federal
after-acquired
lands
which
is
the
type
of
lands
an
issue
in
this
case,
were
the
lands
that
the
federal
government
required
for
specific
federal
purposes
throughout
the
year
after
annexation.
these
were
acquired
from
private
parties
by
condemnation
purchase,
gift
and
the
like.
but
i
want
to
emphasize
if
the
court
please
that
the
great
bulk
of
the
lands
which
the
united
states
acquired
and
kept
until
statehood
were
the
ceded
lands.
now
these
ceded
lands
were
intended
to
have
been
held
in
trust
with
the
people
of
hawaii.
actually
however
as
time
went
on
more
and
more
of
the
lands
were
withdrawn
for
specific
federal
use
and
i
want
to
emphasize
if
the
court
please,
again
that
the
trust
was
never
recompensed
for
this
very
extensive
taking
of
lands
by
the
federal
government.
even
the
land
switched
to
territorial
government,
acquired
itself
were
always
subject
to
withdrawal
for
federal
purposes,
in
which
case
the
united
states
got
the
use
of
the
land
and
paid
no
compensation.
it
is
about
the
status
of
the
federal
after-acquired
lands
when
they
become
surplus
that
this
case
centers.
the
housing
projects
here
aforementioned
are
located
on
the
federal
after-acquired
lands.
when
state
attempts
--
yes
sir.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
no
sir.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
hawaii
does
get
the
territorial
lands
--
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
yes
but
still,
even
such
lands
are
subject
to
withdrawal
by
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
five
years
at
the
state
has
--
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
yes
sir.
may
i
proceed?
once
state
obtained
in
1959,
the
state
did
not
get
title
to
all
and
nearly
all
of
the
lands
which
the
united
states
had
obtained
free
from
the
state
of
hawaii
in
1898.
this
happened
primarily
because
the
best
of
ceded
lands
in
hawaii
are
originally
intended
to
be
held
in
trust
for
hawaii
were
largely
withdrawn
from
the
trust
without
compensation
and
were
kept
by
the
united
states.
and
on
top
of
that,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
under
the
hawaii
statehood
act,
the
federal
government
was
to
permitted
to
go
on
making
land
withdrawals
for
a
five
year
period
after
statehood.
in
other
words,
hawaii
was
compelled
to
give
up
urgently
needed
lands
because
they
were
needed
by
the
federal
government.
even
though
they
were
rightfully
theirs
under
any
equitable
principles.
now
hawaii
has
a
shortage
of
land.
much
of
the
land
is
mountainous
and
is
capable
of
very
limited
use.
population
density
is
high
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
and
on
one
island,
we
have
practically
all
the
people
600,000.
here
there
are
extensive
holdings
by
the
federal
government,
somehow
most
of
the
good
ceded
lands
are
located
on
the
island
of
oahu
and
somehow
the
federal
government
saw
fit
to
take
away
most
of
the
ceded
land
located
on
the
island
of
oahu.
and
most
of
those
lands
are
badly
needed
for
public
housing
and
for
other
housing
purposes.
we
feel
that
it
was
to
rectify
this
inequity
that
congress
enacted
certain
provision
under
statehood
act.
for
those
provisions,
the
statehood
act
has
offered
to
us
for
ratification
contain
a
procedure
under
which
the
state
would
get
surface
federal
land
under
that
procedure
all
federal
surface
lands
in
hawaii
whether
ceded
lands
or
after
acquired
land
were
to
be
conveyed
to
the
states.
this
procedure
was
not
restricted
to
ceded
land
and
territorial
land
as
the
solicitor
general
states.
it
was
extended
to
all
federal
lands
in
hawaii
otherwise
there
would
be
no
compensation
for
the
state
for
the
best
of
the
ceded
and
territorial
land,
which
had
been
taken
by
the
federal
government
without
compensation
and
were
permanently
lost
to
hawaii.
the
federal
attorney
general
in
his
opinion
when
he
passed
on
this
matter
recognized
the
state
equitable
position,
an
equitable
claim,
here
for
all
surplus
federal
land
in
hawaii
although
disagreeing
with
the
state,
it
saw
that
the
state
had
an
equitable
claim
in
an
allotment
of
unneeded
surplus
after-acquired
land,
a
claim
that
hawaii
as
he
puts
it
“ought
to
receive
the
surplus
after-acquired
property
in
compensation
for
the
many
sacrifices
that
hawaii
made
for
the
united
states.”
and
as
a
basis
for
this,
he
particularly
mentioned
extensive
ceded
land
that
the
united
states
was
not
parting
with.
the
interpretation
to
state
as
containment
for
does
not
put
it
in
a
favorite
position
as
compared
to
the
other
states
and
obvious
comparison
is
of
course
the
state
of
alaska
admitted
to
the
union
only
a
year
before
we
were
admitted.
there
were
no
ceded
or
trust
land
in
state
of
alaska.
all
the
federal
land
there,
were
purchased
by,
purchase
of
valuable
consideration.
nonetheless,
alaska
was
given
all
of
its
territorial
lands
and
a
grant
of
over
100
million
acres
of
federal
land,
which
is
25
times
the
total
acreage
that
we
have
in
the
state
of
hawaii.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
that's
my
understanding
sir.
it's
federally
owned
land
sir.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
in
a
sense
yes
justice
goldberg.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
because
in
alaska,
we
take
a
position
of
100
million
acres
of
federal
land
and
i
am
sure
some
of
them
were
purchased
for
valid
consideration
which
can
be
called
after
a
quite
profit
were
eternal
by
the
grants
of
the
state.
now
we
are
asking
only
a
portion
of
or
total
of
30,000
acres
after-acquired
land.
so
it
is
similar.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
fact
of
the
result
is
the
same
justice
goldberg.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
alaska
sir.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
[inaudible]
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
i
would
say
by
mutual
agreement.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
it's
great
but
different
because
as
i
stated
initially
44%
of
the
lands
in
hawaii
were
owned
by
the
republic
of
hawaii.
it
was
never
purchased
for
any
valuable
consideration
by
the
united
states.
that
44%
of
land
were
all
taken
over
by
the
federal
government
without
paying
any
compensation
for
it.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
i
do
not
wish
to
imply
that
sir,
because
by
mutual
agreement
we
became
a
territory
of
the
united
stated
and
by
mutual
agreement
the
public
lands
were
turned
over
to
the
united
stated,
but
i
wish
to
state
this
sir,
that
all
this
acreage
were
used
by
the
united
states
without
paying
any
compensation
and
the
united
states
has
received
tremendous
value
for
said
lands
and
a
great
portion
of
that
has
been
retained
permanently
by
the
united
sates
again
without
extra
compensation
for
the
retention.
mr.
bert
t.
kobayashi
that
is
correct
justice
stewart.
may
i
proceed?
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
of
great
importance
to
a
rapidly
growing
state
with
as
limited,
with
as
little
land
as
hawaii.
my
associate
dennis
lyons
will
demonstrate,
i
firmly
believe
that
a
little
construction
of
the
act
gives
all
surplus
federal
land
in
hawaii
to
hawaii
instead
of
having
them
put
on
the
auction
block.
i
have
emphasized
the
equities
of
the
situation.
the
needs
which
hawaii
has
for
these
lands,
the
fact
that
hawaii
was
not
equitably
treated
as
other
state
with
respect
of
land
holding,
because
as
i
read
in
the
defendant's
brief,
his
press
for
contention
seems
to
be
that
the
literal
words
of
the
act
should
be
ignored
because
hawaii
does
not
have
an
equitable
claim
for
said
land.
the
court
pleads
on
the
contrary,
hawaii
has
a
strongest
of
the
equitable
claim,
and
we
believe
congress
recognize
this,
thanks.
