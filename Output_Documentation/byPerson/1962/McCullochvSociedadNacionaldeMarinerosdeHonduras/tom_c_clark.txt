of
course
all
the
boats
are
here
temporarily,
aren't
they,
even
your
vessels?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
don't
understand
that
your
boat
stayed
here
permanently
either.
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
this
distinction
seems
to
be
the
stock
ownership
that
you
alleged.
justice

that
wasn't
--

that
wasn't

what
do
you
mean
by
nominal
owner?
justice
tom
c.
clark

seems
to
me
when
you
say
what
you've
said,

the
ship
or
the

can
you
make
any
suggestion,
mr.
solicitor
general.
how
many
of
these
vessels
present
the
problem
which
you
say
we
don't
have
to
decide
in
this
case?
justice
tom
c.
clark
because
i
understand
mr.
manoli,
he
wants
to
go
much
further
than
you're
suggesting
you
want
it
to
be.
