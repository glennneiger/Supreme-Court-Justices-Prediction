mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
numbers
91,
93,
and
107
are
companion
cases
and
they
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
and
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
these
three
cases
arise
out
of
a
single
proceeding
before
the
national
labor
relations
board,
in
which
the
board
directed
an
election
among
the
unlicensed
seamen
onboard
a
fleet
of
vessels
flying
the
honduran
flag.
in
general,
this
litigation
deals
with
the
applicability
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
foreign-flag
vessels
which
are
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation
and
also
have
other
substantial
contacts
with
this
nation.
more
specifically,
the
immediate
controversy
before
the
court
is
whether
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
labor
act
extends
to
a
fleet
of
vessels
which
fly
the
honduran
flag,
employ
honduran
seamen,
primarily
honduran
seamen,
and
have
other
contacts
of
the
flag
nation
but
which
are
beneficially
owned
and
operated
under
the
control
of
an
american
corporation
are
engaged
in
commerce
between
this
nation
and
foreign
nations
including
the
flag
nation
and
carry
almost
exclusively
the
products
and
supplies
of
the
american
corporation.
now,
the
facts
which
give
rise,
the
basic
facts
which
give
rise
to
this
controversy
are
essentially
not
in
dispute
and
i
shall
summarize
them
briefly
as
i
can.
in
1959,
the
national
maritime
union
of
america
petitioned
the
board
to
certify
it
as
the
bargain
representative
of
the
unlicensed
seamen
onboard
a
fleet
of
vessels
flying
the
honduran
flag
and
owner
controlled,
owner
controlled
by
empresa,
a
honduran
corporation.
the
n.
m.
u.'s
petition
--
the
empresa
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
united
fruit
and
the
n.
m.
u.'s
petition
before
the
board
named
the
--
named
united
fruit
as
the
employer
of
the
seamen
in
question.
for
some
years,
these
seamen
had
been
represented
by
honduran
union,
which
i
shall
call
marineros.
and
although
marineros
was
invited
to
participate
in
the
proceedings
before
the
board,
it
declined
to
do
so.
however,
another
honduran
union,
the
sindicato,
did
participate
in
the
board
proceedings.
united
fruit,
as
is
well-known,
is
an
american
corporation
with
its
principal
place
of
business
in
boston.
virtually
all
of
its
stock
is
owned
by
american
citizens
and
it
is
engaged
in
the
production
of
tropical
produce,
marketing
of
that
produce,
and
the
transportation
thereof.
this
annual
imports
into
this
country
exceed
$1
million.
united
fruit
carries
on
its
operations
through
approximately
50-60
subsidiaries.
the
subsidiaries
handle
the
day-to-day
operations
of
the
enterprise
while
united
fruit
looks
to
long-ranged
development
and
policies
including
the
purchase,
the
improvement,
and
the
scrapping
or
sale
of
the
vessels
that
are
used
in
the
enterprise.
empresa
is
one
of
these
subsidiaries.
it
was
organized
in
1941
by
united
under
the
laws
of
honduras.
united
supplied
all
of
the
capital,
presently
owns
all
of
the
stock,
names
its
directors
who
in
turn,
elect
the
officers
of
empresa.
empresa,
as
i
say,
is
organized
under
the
laws
of
honduras
and
its
business
--
it
is
engaged
solely
in
the
operation
of
the
enterprise's
vessels,
in
owning
and
operating
the
enterprise's
vessels
which
are
registered
under
the
laws
of
honduras.
it
does
not
carry
cargo
or
passengers
on
its
own
account.
virtually
all
of
its
income
is
derived
from
time
charters
and
it
--
with
a
possible
occasional
exception,
it
charters
--
it
time
charters
its
vessels
to
the
parent
corporation
and
the
vessels
which
are
involved
in
this
litigation
were
so
charged.
now,
empresa
supplies
fully
equipped,
fully
manned,
and
fully
provisioned
ships.
it
hires
the
crews
in
honduras.
the
crews
are
primarily
honduran
citizens
and
they
sign
honduran
contracts
or
ship
articles,
i
guess
is
the
word.
and,
as
i
say,
for
some
years
--
for
some
years,
these
crews
have
been
represented
by
the
honduran
union,
the
respondent
in
no.
107.
united
fruit
controls
the
movements
of
these
ships
which
are
time
charters
from
empresa
and
they
are
used
primarily
to
carry
the
products
--
carry
the
products
of
united
fruits'
latin
america
and
central
america
operations.
they
stop
at
various
ports
in
central
and
south
america,
including
those
of
honduras,
and
on
their
--
they
call
regularly.
they
call
regularly
at
united
states
ports.
they
are
used
interchangeably.
they
are
used
interchangeably
by
united
fruit
which
ships
with
either
united
fruit
owns
directly
or
which
it
time
charters
from
other
wholly
owned
american
subsidiaries.
the
ships
carry
the
same
cargo.
they
call
at
the
same
ports
and
the
selection
of
a
ship
--
the
selection
of
a
ship
for
any
particular
trip
is
determined
on
the
base
of
size,
speed,
and
availability
without
regard
to
the
flag
or
the
ownership
of
the
vessel.
these,
in
essence,
are
the
facts
which
were
before
the
board
and
on
these
facts
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
apparently
not.
they're
used
interchangeably
and,
as
i
say,
the
facts
indicate
that
they
stop
at
honduras,
other
central
and
south
american
countries
and
they
are
used
interchangeably
with
other
boats
that
are
owned
by
united
--
by
the
parent
corporation.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
record
is
that
they
regularly
call
at
united
states
ports.
i
don't
think
the
record
goes
beyond
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
think
there
are
any
figures
in
the
record
that
--
at
least
i'm
not
aware
of
any
that
are
in
the
record
to
show
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
again,
i
don't
--
i
think
the
record
is
silent
on
this.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
empresa
has
negotiated
with
this
union,
with
this
honduran
union
in
the
--
in
honduras.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that
is
where
its
place
of
business
is,
yes.
i
think
it
also
has
had
from
time
--
sometime
in
the
past,
if
not
presently,
empresa
has
had
an
office
in
this
country.
now,
the
ships
as
i
say,
are
provisioned
by
empresa
and
the
supplies
are
purchased
either
by
empresa
directly
or
they're
purchased
through
another
subsidiary
of
united
fruit.
and,
the
repairs
and
the
dry-docking
of
the
vessels
are,
perhaps
not
always
but
frequently,
done
in
the
united
states.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
again
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
again,
i
don't
know.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
quite
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
--
the
board
has
cases
in
which
there
are
no
contacts
with
the
flag
nation
other
than
the
registration.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but,
this
one
here
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
is
an
important
consideration
to
be
taken
into
account
that
it
has
no
contacts
with
the
flag
nation
and
i
shall
come
later
on
as
to
the
test
which
the
board
applies.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
honduras
has
labor
law
which
requires
that
a
honduran
union
be
recognized
by
that
country,
that
its
membership
consist
with
90%
honduran
nationals.
on
the
facts
which
i
have
outlined
briefly,
the
board
found
that
the
united
fruit
and
empresa
were
joint
employers
of
the
seamen
here
in
question,
that
empresa's
operations
were
part
of
a
single
integrated
operation
which
is
owned
and
directed
by
an
american-owned,
an
american-based
enterprise
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation.
the
board
concluded
--
the
board
concluded
that
the
act
applied
to
empresa's
maritime
operations
to
these
vessels
despite
their
foreign
registry
and
that
it
would
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
statute
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
these
vessels.
accordingly
--
accordingly,
the
board
directed
the
--
an
election
among
these
seamen
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
assert
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose
of
holding
a
representational
action
among
the
seamen
onboard
these
vessels.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
the
board's
order
directed
an
election
to
determine
whether
they
wished
to
be
represented
by
the
n.
m.
u.,
the
national
maritime
union
of
america,
or
by
sindicato,
the
honduran
union
which
had
intervened
in
the
board
proceedings,
or
by
no
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
was
--
the
unit
that
was
sought
by
the
n.
m.
u.
was
a
fleet-wide
unit,
fleet-wide
unit
and
the
mechanics
of
the
election
were
to
be
that
--
either
they
were
--
the
board
would
mail
--
would
mail
ballots
to
the
seamen
onboard
these
vessels
which
would
not
be
on
a
certain
port
on
a
certain
day,
and
those
ships
and
crews
which
were
in
a
port
on
the
date
indicated
by
the
board
for
the
election,
the
election
would
be
held
at
the
portside
or,
if
permission
were
granted,
i
suppose,
onboard
the
vessel
itself.
now,
the
board's
order
directing
this
election
precipitated
two
lawsuits,
one
by
empresa,
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
and
the
other
one
by
the
marineros,
a
hungarian
union
in
the
southern
--
in
the
district
of
columbia.
each
sought
to
enjoin
the
board
from
holding
the
election,
asserting
that
the
board
had
exceeded
its
statutory
powers
in
asserting
jurisdiction
over
these
vessels
for
this
purpose.
the
upshot
of
this
litigation
was
that
both
courts,
both
the
court
of
appeals
--
court
of
appeals
the
for
the
second
circuit
and
the
district
of
columbia
court,
held
that
the
board
had
exceeded
its
statutory
jurisdiction
in
asserting
that
--
in
asserting
its
authority
over
its
--
in
seeking
to
assert
authority
over
these
vessels
and
both
courts
enjoined
the
board
from
proceeding
with
the
election.
now,
the
rationale
of
the
two
decisions
is
somewhat
different
and
i
should
like
to
state
the
difference
briefly.
the
district
of
columbia
court
held
that
the
act
did
not
apply
to
a
vessel
which,
as
in
this
case,
flew
a
foreign-flag
and
which
had
foreign
crews
who
had
been
engaged
under
contracts
pursuant
to
foreign
laws.
the
district
of
columbia
court
here
apparently
gave
decisive
weight,
decisive
and
dispositive
weight
to
the
fact
that
these
boats
here
were
registered
here
under
the
laws
of
a
foreign
nation
and
through
the
flag
of
that
nation.
now,
the
second
circuit,
on
the
other
hand,
took
the
position
that,
while
acknowledging
--
while
acknowledging
that
the
flag
was
of
cardinal
importance,
nevertheless,
it
agreed
with
the
board
that
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
flag
would
depend
upon
an
evaluation
in
the
context
of
the
policies
of
this
statute
upon
an
evaluation
of
the
interacting
american
and
foreign
interest,
the
substantiality
of
the
american
contacts
as
compared
to
the
substantiality
of
the
foreign
contacts,
and
the
weighing
of
these
competing
considerations.
on
that
premise
--
on
that
premise,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
the
contacts
with
honduras
were
sufficiently
substantial
to
outweigh
the
american
contacts
and
that
therefore,
the
board
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
these
particular
vessels.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
there
was
--
there
was
at
the
time
that
the
board
conducted
or
had
these
representation
proceedings
before
it,
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
with
empresa,
that
agreement
expired
at
about
the
time
that
the
board
issued
its
decision
of
this
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not
for
the
board.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
not
--
there
was
no
problem
of
that
kind
for
the
board.
now,
as
i
have
said,
the
immediate
problem
here
is
whether
the
board
has
jurisdiction
for
the
purpose
of
holding
these
representation
elections
over
these
particular
vessels.
but,
the
issue
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
this
case,
namely
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
labor
board
has
jurisdiction
over
foreign-flag
vessels
which
are
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation,
that
issue
transcends
--
transcends
this
particular
case
and
i
venture
to
think
--
i
venture
to
think
that
the
decision
of
this
court
would
have
radiations
that
would
extend
beyond
this
particular
case.
and
i
believe
that
neither
analysis
nor
decision
should
be
unmindful
of
the
larger
context.recent
years
--
recent
years
have
seen
the
development
of
the
so
--
the
particular
development,
i
might
say,
the
impressive
development
of
the
so-called
flag
of
convenience
or
flag
of
necessity
vessels
or
fleets.
in
general,
the
term,
as
i
understand
it,
i'm
talking
about
where
i've
read
it
somewhere
--
in
general,
the
term
is
used
to
describe
the
flag
of
a
nation
which
permits
the
registration
of
foreign-owned
and
foreign-controlled
vessels
under
its
laws
under
conditions
which
are
deemed
either
opportune
or
necessary
by
the
parties
that
seek
to
register
their
vessels
under
the
laws
of
that
particular
country.
in
common
usage,
however,
the
term
is
generally
used
gen
--
normally
used
to
refer
to
the
flags
of
panama,
liberia,
and
honduras,
the
so-called
panlibhon
countries.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
afraid
that's
a
little
beyond
my
depth,
mr.
justice.
the
--
i
don't
know
what
the
mechanics
are.
what
the
mechanics
are
of
registration.
someone
that's
more
familiar
with
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
we
do
know
what
it
--
what
it
is
to
that
--
i
know
what
it
is
that
has
attracted
these
particular
vessels
to
the
laws
of
--
just
what
the
mechanics
of
the
registration
are,
that
is
what
i'm
ignorant
of.
but
what
it's
attracted
--
what
has
caused
shipping
interests,
to
register
their
vessels
under
the
laws
of
these
countries
is
--that
this
is
particularly
true,
particularly
true
of
american
shipping
interests,
that
they
matter
--
that
they
avoid
tax
--
certain
types
of
taxation
of
which
they
would
be
subject
if
they
were
registered
under
the
laws
of
this
country
and
if
they
flew
the
flag
of
this
country.
also,
because
they
employ
foreign
seamen,
their
--
the
weight
scales,
the
weight
scales
are
much
lower
than
those
that
are
paid
to
american
seamen
onboard
american
flag
vessels,
and
those
are
the
two
part
--
two
significant
attractions
for
registration
in
these
particular
countries.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
savings
and
taxation.
savings
and
taxations.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
so
that
--
it
has
been
said
that
the
chief
attraction
is
the
savings
and
taxation,
savings
and
taxation.
now,
the
size
and
growth
of
these
flag
of
convenience
vessels
at
the
magnitude
of
their
operations
in
international
trade,
and
particular
in
the
trade
of
this
country,
are
truly
of
impressive
proportions.
we
have
some
figures
that
in
1960
--
1960,
nearly
2000
vessels
of
over
20
million
deadweight
tons
were
registered
under
laws
of
panama
--
of
the
panlibhon
countries.
and
of
that
number,
more
than
400,
more
than
400
were
american-owned
or
american-controlled.
and
again
in
that
year,
again
in
that
year,
these
panlibhon
vessels,
these
accounted
carrier,
they
carried
nearly
40%
of
the
seaborne
commerce
of
this
nation
and
in
that
year,
24%
of
that
commerce
was
carried
by
panlibhon
vessels
which
were
american-owned
and
controlled.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
some
were
built
here
in
this
country
and
were
transferred
from
this
country
to
those
nations.
some
have
been
built
elsewhere.
and
they've
never
been
--
some
of
them
may
have
never
been
registered
under
the
laws
of
this
country.
they
were
built
elsewhere
and
registered
under
laws
of
these
three
nations.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
have
it
in
mind,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
it
in
mind.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
united
fruit,
i
dare
say
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
has
a
very
high
investment
in
honduras.
and
that's
true.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
don't
have
that
comparison,
your
honor,
but
this
is
the
fact,
however.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
have
any
figures
to
that
purpose.
now,
the
great
majority
of
these
vessels
and
particularly
the
american
vessels,
particularly
the
american
vessels,
they
have
no
contact
with
the
flag
nation
other
than
the
fact
that
they've
been
registered
there.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
basic
issue
which
we
see
in
this
case,
a
threshold
issue
in
this
case,
is
whether
or
not
the
board
has
any
business
in
this
area,
whether
flag
is
decisive.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
flag
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
court
can
either
assume
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
this
case
that
flag
is
not
controlling
and
dispose
of
the
case
under
the
basis
of
whether
the
contacts
are
outweighed
--
or
the
honduran
contacts
outweigh
the
american
contacts.
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
the
court
below
that
the
honduran
contacts
outweigh
the
american
contacts,
then
it
has
to
face
the
basic
question
of
whether
flag
is
decisive
or
not.
and
it
is
--
as
i
say,
it
is
only
if
this
court
agrees
with
the
court
below
that
the
contacts
with
honduras
outweigh
those
of
this
country,
that
it
need
not
reach
the
$64
question
of
whether
a
flag
is
decisive
or
not.
now,
we
think
that
the
court
--
we
think
that
the
court
should
address
itself
to
that
problem
because
the
issue
is
in
this
case.
it's
properly
presented
here
and
there's
much
litigation
with
respect
to
this
matter
here.
in
fact,
presently,
there
is
pending
in
the
fifth
circuit,
a
case
of
this
kind.
there
is
one
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals.
in
both
cases,
there
are
no
contacts
with
the
flag
nation.
the
states
have
had
problems
with
respect
to
this
thing
here
as
to
whether
or
not
the
area
is
preempted
by
the
federal
legislation
or
whether
they
are
not.
and
finally,
i
suggest,
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
an
issue
that
should
be
deferred
because
i
don't
think
the
future
is
going
to
bring
any
further
insights
into
this
problem
than
the
court
will
have
today
--
we'll
have
today.
and
for
all
these
reasons
--
for
all
these
reasons,
we
suggest
that
the
court
deal
with
the
basic
question
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
board,
as
i
say,
has
any
business
at
all
in
this
area
and,
if
so,
to
what
extent.
now,
it
is
the
--
i
just
want
to
round
up
the
economic
picture
a
little
bit.
i've
already
indicated
--
i've
already
indicated
that
a
great
majority
of
the
american-flag
--
of
these
american
vessels
that
are
owned
by
american
interest
and
that
fly
--
the
panlibhon
flags
have
no
contacts
with
those
nations.
and
the
few
that
do,
as
in
this
case,
have
only
contacts
with
the
flag
nation
in
connection
with
the
american-based
enterprises'
operations.
and
an
interesting
facet
--
an
interesting
facet
of
this
flag
of
convenience
development
is
that
today,
liberia,
which
i
take
it
is
not
an
oil
producing
country,
has
the
largest
and
most
modern
tanker
fleet
in
the
world.
and,
to
round
out
the
economic
pictures
i
said
a
moment
ago,
one
of
the
inducements
for
this
kind
of
an
operation
is
that
these
shipping
interests
can
hire
foreign
seamen.
in
fact,
they
almost
always
hire
foreign
seamen,
had
wages
lower
than
those
which
prevail
on
american
boats.
and
as
a
result
--
and
as
a
result,
the
american
unions
have
become
quite
concerned
of
course
because
the
tremendous
drop
--
tremendous
drop
in
the
employment
of
american
seamen.and
this
concern
has
triggered
off
the
organizational
efforts
which
found
their
culmination
in
this
type
of
case.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
largely
since
world
war
ii,
yes.
the
last
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
no,
no,
not
at
all,
quite
the
contrary.
this
has
happened
before.
in
fact,
one
of
the
books
which
has
been
cited
--
one
of
the
studies
that's
been
cited
here,
some
of
this
may
go
back
as
far
back
as
the
16th
century.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
this
enormous
development,
your
honor,
this
enormous
development
has
taken
place
since
the
world
war
ii.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
presumably,
if
they
were
--
if
these
vessels
were
forced
--
as
they
claim
that
they
might
be
by
assertion
of
board
jurisdiction,
they
were
forced
to
transfer
the
registration
to
some
other
country,
perhaps
they
would
have
tax
problems
there
which
they
presently
do
not
have
under
the
laws
of
liberia,
honduras,
and
panama.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i'm
sure
we
can
get
those
figures,
your
honor.
we'll
supply
them.
i
do
not
have
them
in
mind,
but
we
will
make
every
effort
to
supply
those
figures.
now,
there's
one
minute
remaining
and
i'm
about
to
reach
the
legal
analysis
of
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
alright,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
may
it
please
the
court.
it
appears
yesterday
that
the
basic
issue
which
lies
at
the
heart
of
this
case
is
whether
and
to
what
extent,
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
labor
act
extends
to
foreign-flag
vessels
which
are
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation
and
of
also
have
other
substantial
contacts
with
this
country.
it
is
the
board's
position
that
the
act
extends
to
foreign-flag
vessels
which
are
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation
where
the
maritime
operation
is
either
primarily
based
and
directed
out
of
this
country
or
is
essentially
an
adjunct
by
the
american
corporation
engaged
in
the
seaborne
commerce
of
this
country
so
that
unbalanced
--
so
that
unbalanced,
the
shipping
may
reasonably
be
deemed
to
be
a
shipping
of
this
nation
rather
than
that
of
a
foreign
nation
which
only
the
exigencies
of
international
trade
bring
to
these
shores.
analysis
of
this
proposition,
i
take
it,
must
start
with
the
statute.
in
sketching
the
jurisdictional
reach
of
the
labor
act,
congress
painted
it
with
an
extremely
broad
brush.
the
declared
policy
of
the
statute
is
to
safeguard
the
foreign
and
domestic
commerce
of
this
nation
from
activity,
the
intent
or
necessary
effect
to
which
is
to
burden
or
obstruct
that
commerce.
the
--
to
this
end
--
to
this
end,
congress
empowered
the
board
to
prevent
unfair
labor
practices
and
to
resolve
representation
disputes
which
would
burden
or
obstruct
the
free
flow
of
this
nation's
commerce
both
foreign
and
domestic.
the
touchstone,
the
touchstone
of
the
act's
jurisdiction
is
the
effect
of
the
particular
activity
upon
the
foreign
and
domestic
commerce
of
this
country
and
not
the
source.
and
as
this
court
said
long
ago,
congress
in
--
the
act
reflects
the
congressional
policy
in
the
exercise
of
congress'
plenary
constitutional
authority
over
commerce
to
eliminate
--
to
eliminate
industrial
strife
without
regard
to
the
source.
now,
there
can
be
and
indeed
there
is
no
question
of
the
power
of
congress
to
reach
these
foreign-flag
vessels
that
are
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation.
indeed,
this
court
once
said
that
the
power
of
congress,
the
condition
access
to
our
ports
by
foreign-flag
vessels
that
complies
with
what
congress
deems
to
be
good
american
policy
cannot
be
questioned
nor
can
there
be
any
question
as
to
a
literal
reach
of
the
statute
that
literally
the
statute
encompasses
these
flag
vessels.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
of
course
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
of
course,
we
are
aware
that
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
does
not
end
our
inquiry
and
we're
also
aware
that
a
part
from
the
language
of
the
statute
which
is
quite
broad
of
course,
that
apart
from
the
language
of
the
statute,
congress
gave
no
specific
indication
either
in
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history
or
in
the
legislative
history
whether
and
to
what
extent
the
act
should
apply
to
foreign-flag
vessels
which
are
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation.
and
perhaps
as
the
court
below
said,
it
would
be
a
bit
unrealistic
to
a
trade
to
congress,
a
subjective
intent
to
reach
his
flag
--
this
flag
of
convenience
vessels
that
are
engaged
in
the
commerce
to
this
nation
because
as
i
said
yesterday,
the
development
of
these
--
this
fleet,
this
type
of
shipping
has
come
about
largely
since
the
enactment
of
the
wagner
act.
but
these
considerations,
i
submit,
as
this
court
indicated
in
the
vermilya-brown
case
are
not
conclusive,
nor
decisive.
what
is
important
is
the
policy
of
the
statute
and
that
policy
is
crystal
clear
and
it
is
the
function
of
the
board
as
well
as
the
court
to
determine
what
congress,
given
that
policy,
given
that
far
broad
policy
would
have
done
with
a
situation
which
now
confronts
this
court.
as
i
said
yesterday,
the
concern
of
congress
was
with
the
disruptive
effects
of
industrial
strife
upon
the
foreign
and
domestic
commerce
of
this
country.
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute
comp
--
is
comprehensibly
to
eliminate
this
industrial
strife.
now,
it
can
hardly
be
thought
that
congress
would
have
had
less
concern
with
industrial
strife
affecting
foreign-flag
vessels
which
are
engaged
in
the
shipping
of
this
country
or
in
the
commerce
of
this
country
and
which
may
reasonably
be
deemed
to
be
essentially
the
shipping
of
this
nation
that
congress
would
have
had
less
concern
with
the
disruptive
industrial
strife
affecting
those
ships
than
it
had
with
the
american-flag
vessels
where
the
plain
fact
is
of
course
that
industrial
strife
affecting
one
or
the
other
will
impede
the
free
flow
of
commerce
of
this
nation.
indeed,
perhaps
industrial
strife
affecting
foreign-flag
vessels
that
are
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation
may
impede
it
even
more
than
industrial
strife
affecting
american
flag
ships
in
view
of
the
important
role
that
these
flag
ships
as
i
indicated
yesterday
are
playing
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation.
now,
the
problem
of
determining
the
reach
of
domestic
legislation
which
like
the
labor
act
has
broad
jurisdictional
coverage
is
not
a
noble
one.
congress
has
not
infrequently
enacted
legislation
which
has
had
broad
general
coverage
without
at
the
same
time
specifically
indicating
to
what
extent
such
legislation
should
apply
to
activity
which
has
foreign
aspects,
activity
which
may
have
extraterritorial
aspects,
or
activity
on
board
foreign-flag
vessels.
where
that
is
the
case,
where
that
is
the
case,
the
statute
is
--
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
must
not
be
determined
in
a
mechanical
fashion
either
on
the
basis
of
the
literal
universality
of
the
language
or
on
the
basis
of
outmoded
concepts
that
a
ship
is
floating
piece
of
the
flag
nations
territory
or
by
slavish
submission
to
the
flag
in
--
to
the
flag.
on
the
contrary,
we
think
that
the
proper
test
is
that
the
scope
of
the
statute
must
be
determined
in
the
light
of
the
policies
of
that
statute
upon
the
american
and
foreign
interest
present,
the
substantiality
of
one
as
against
the
other
and
a
weighing
of
these
interests
with
due
regard
to
considerations
of
international
comity.
this,
as
we
understand
it,
is
the
teaching
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
lauritzen
case.
now,
in
the
lauritzen
case
and
that
case
involved
the
jones
act
which
provides
that
any
seamen
may
bring
suit
in
a
federal
court
--
federal
district
court
to
recover
for
injuries
suffered
in
the
course
of
his
employment.
in
that
case,
the
problem
was
whether
a
foreign
seaman
who
had
been
injured
on
board
a
foreign
boat
in
foreign
waters
could
take
advantage
of
the
jones
act.
now,
this
court
held
that
he
could
not.but
the
approach
which
this
court
took
to
the
question
of
statutory
coverage
of
the
jones
act
which
again
had
this
literal
universal
language,
the
approach
which
the
court
had
took
this
question
of
statutory
construction
we
think
has
relevance
here.
the
court
there
said,
the
court
there
said
that
the
flag
is
of
cardinal
importance
but
domestic
interest,
domestic
policies
and
the
substantiality
of
american
contacts
may
tell
--
in
a
given
case,
may
took
the
balance
against
the
flag.
now,
the
board
in
determining
the
reach
of
our
statute
with
respect
to
these
ships
has
taken
its
cue
from
the
lauritzen
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
true,
your
honor
and
the
significance
of
that
may
be
that
at
least
theoretically,
there
more
--
be
more
danger
of
conflict
between
us
and
some
foreign
nations
than
there
would
be
in
a
lauritzen
type
of
case.
and
i
shall
subsequently
come
to
argue
the
point,
that
point
as
to
the
extent
of
this
conflict
between
us
and
other
nations.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
is
our
position
that
they
are
joint
employers.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
you
still
have
of
course
the
fact
that
these
seamen
are
employed
on
board
with
foreign
flag.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
expect
that
the
other
side
will
say
yes
and
i
--
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
we
would
not
assert
jurisdiction
over
those
who
would
stay
in
honduras.
that
is
true.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
problem
here
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
does
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--avoid
that
problem.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now,
we
think
that
it's
an
import
--
it's
one
of
the
factors
that
the
board
took
into
account
and
we
don't
believe
that
even
if
this
court
could
conclude
that
united
fruit
is
not
a
joint
employer
that
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
the
board
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
what?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
statute
itself
of
course
your
honor
defines
the
term
commerce
to
mean
trade,
traffic,
commerce
etcetera
among
the
several
states,
between
the
district
of
columbia
or
any
territory
of
the
united
states
and
any
state
or
other
territory
or
between
any
foreign
country
and
any
state
territory
to
the
district
of
columbia.
so
it
covers
any
trade
between
this
country,
this
country
and
a
foreign
country.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
not
necessarily
a
citizen,
no.
no.
you
may
have
an
alien
for
example.
an
alien
who
is
engaged
in
business
here
and
engaged
in
the
foreign
commerce
of
this
county
and
the
act
certainly
would
come
to
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
transportation
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
transportation
of
goods,
supplies
between
this
country
and
other
countries.
now,
in
--
as
i've
said,
in
determining
the
reach
of
the
statute,
the
board
has
taken
its
cue
from
the
approach
which
this
court
took
in
the
lauritzen
case
and
the
board
acknowledges,
the
board
acknowledges
that
the
flag
determines
the
nationality
of
the
ship.
but
as
against
that
factor,
it
has
taken
into
account
the
following
factors.
one,
whether
the
nationality
of
the
bene
--
one,
the
nationality
of
the
beneficial
owner
of
the
ship.
two,
whether
the
operations
of
the
ship
are
directed
primarily
from
the
united
states,
the
regularity
and
frequency
of
its
visit
to
united
states
ports
and
the
nature
of
cargo
and
passengers
carried,
where
the
shipper's
provision
repaired
and
finally,
whether
the
ship
carries
the
trade
of
its
flag
country
and
if
so,
whether
such
trade
is
merely
a
concomitance
of
--
or
incidents
of
operations
of
an
american-based
enterprise.
if
--
in
finding
the
evaluation
of
these
factors,
the
board
concludes
that
the
shipping
is
closely
linked
to
the
economy
of
this
country
that
on
balance,
the
contacts
which
this
shipping
has
with
this
country
make
it
essentially
the
shipping
of
this
nation.
then
the
board
says
the
act
applies.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
upon
an
evaluation
of
these
factors,
the
board
concludes
that
the
contacts
with
this
country
are
relatively
insubstantial
and
that
the
shipping
is
essentially
that
of
a
foreign
country
which
only
the
exigencies
of
international
trade
bring
to
this
shore
--
bring
to
our
shores
then
the
act
does
not
apply.
now,
the
board's
test
brings
within
the
coverage
of
the
statute,
those
vessels
which
are
closely
linked
to
our
economy
and
excludes
those
which
are
not.
now,
we
submit
--
we
submit
that
the
reading
of
the
statute
which
the
board
has
made
and
the
accommodation
which
it
has
made
is
a
proper
one
for
it
brings
within
the
statute
--
for
it
brings
within
the
statute
and
a
--
vessels
which
are
closely
linked
to
the
economy
of
this
nation
despite
their
foreign
flag
and
foreign
registry
and
it
extends
to
them
what
congress
deemed
to
be
good
american
policy,
namely,
the
elimination
of
industrial
strife
in
an
area
that
is
of
vital
and
direct
interest
of
this
country.
that
is
to
say,
it's
foreign
commerce.
at
the
same
time,
at
the
same
time
this
test
does
not
intrude
upon
foreign
interest,
foreign
interest
for
it
does
not
extend
the
act
to
shipping
which
is
essentially
that
of
a
foreign
nation.
now,
i
think
logically
at
this
point,
i
arrive
at
the
benz
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir,
there
is
none.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
nothing
at
all,
however,
one
of
the
reports,
and
this
report
was
cited
in
the
benz
case,
refer
to
the
application
of
the
act
to
the
american
workingmen,
american
workingmen.
now,
i
suggest
your
honor
that
that
was
merely
in
reference
to
american
workingmen
was
a
perfectly
natural
illustrative
kind
of
a
thing,
not
to
intend
it
to
be
exclusive
but
merely
the
thing
that
would
come
quite
natural
to
an
american
political
representative
to
speak
in
terms
of
an
american
workingman.
the
statute
itself,
the
statute
itself
in
its
definition
of
commerce
and
its
definition
of
employer
and
employees
draws
no
distinction
on
the
basis
of
citizenship.
now,
coming
to
benz,
coming
to
benz,
we
have
acknowledged
in
our
briefs
that
there
are
some
language
in
benz
that
militates
quite
strongly
against
the
board's
position
here
because
there
is
some
language
there
that
seems
to
indicate
that
the
labor
act
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
foreign
activity
or
activity
onboard
foreign-flag
vessels.
however,
we
haven't
--
we
don't
read,
we
don't
read
their
decision
to
stand
for
so
broad
of
proposition.
of
course,
this
court
knows
best
what
he's
intended
to
say,
how
far
it
intended
to
go
in
that
case.
but
it
is
important
to
remember
the
facts
in
that
particular
case.
the
courts
in
saying
that
the
labor
act
did
not
apply
in
that
case,
stress
the
fact
that
the
ship
that
was
involved
in
there
was
only
transiently
and
temporarily
in
a
united
states
port
and
that
the
only
contact,
the
only
contact
which
that
flag
had
was
that
a
labor
dispute
erupted,
erupted
while
that
ship
was
temporarily
in
an
american
port.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
a
state
court
and
it
was
removed
to
a
federal
court.
that's
correct.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
think
that
that
term
was
used
in
that
sense,
in
that
case,
at
least
that's
my
reading
of
it
your
honor.
you
wrote
it.
but
i
think
what
the
court
meant
to
say
by
those
two
adverbs,
at
least
as
we
read
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
these
boats
are
engaged
in
a
shuttle
service.
these
particular
boats
are
engaged
in
a
shuttle
service
between
the
united
states
--
united
states
and
these
latin
and
central
american
countries.
but
the
boat
in
the
benz
case
was
really
--
it
was
truly
temporary
in
this
--
in
the
port
of
this
nation
because
after
this
labor
dispute
erupted,
it
wasn't
until
--
apparently
by
the
time
the
case
got
to
this
court.
this
boat
never
came
back
to
this
country.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
stock
ownership
is
an
important
factor
which
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
the
board
takes
into
account.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
it
was
not,
it
was
not.
american
ownership
is
not
necessarily
decisive
of
board
jurisdiction
but
it
is
a
factor
which
the
board
takes
into
account.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
a
dissent
written
by
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
in
these
cases
here,
if
that
--
if
that
decision
of
course
to
go
as
far
as
some
of
its
literal
language
goes,
we
cannot
win
in
this
case.
that's
true.
but
we
think
--
we
think
that
that
decision
must
be
read
in
the
light
of
the
particular
facts
which
were
in
that
case
that
you
had
a
boat
which
contacts
with
this
country
were
of
only
of
--
shall
i
say
a
femoral
very
--
highly
fortuitous,
whereas
here,
in
the
cases
which
the
board
has
had
before,
in
the
case
which
the
board
had
before
it,
the
context
with
this
nation
are
much
more
substantial
than
they
were
in
that
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
which
ship,
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
benz,
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
we
do
have
cases
--
this
is
not
one
of
them
but
the
board
has
had
cases
in
which
there
is
foreign-flag
registry
but
there
is
no
contact,
no
contact
whatsoever
with
the
flag
nation.
now,
in
this
case,
you
do
have
contacts
with
the
flag
nation
and
engage
to
some
extent
of
course
in
the
commerce
of
the
flag
nation
itself.
now,
in
at
least
three
cases
that
the
board
has
had,
and
at
least
three
cases
that
the
board
has
had
that
has
been
american
ownership,
foreign-flag
registry
and
absolutely
no
contacts,
absolutely
no
contacts
with
the
flag
nation.
now,
as
i
say,
our
reading
of
benz
is
that
it
does
not
cover
a
situation
where
the
vessels
have
substantial
contacts
with
its
nation
and
we
are
strengthened
in
that
reading,
we
are
strengthened
in
that
reading
of
benz
by
this
court's
subsequent
decision
in
the
marine
cooks
case
where
again
the
court
in
referring
to
benz,
stress
the
highly
fortuitous
context
of
the
vessel
in
benz
where
the
--
with
this
nation.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
but
in
connection
with
that,
this
court
had
occasion
to
speak
of
the
benz
case.
the
benz
case
as
i
say
it
again
stressed
the
highly
fortuitous
nature
of
the
ships
contacts,
the
benz
ship
contacts
with
this
nation.
now,
the
argument
is
made
--
the
argument
is
made
that
labor
relations
on
board
vessels
have
to
do
with
the
internal
order
of
the
vessel.
and
that
it
is
the
general
recognized
practice
among
the
nations
that
the
internal
order
of
the
vessel
should
be
governed
by
the
flag
nation
and
the
law
of
the
flag
nation
and
that
in
the
light
of
this
practice,
we
should
not
attribute
to
congress
in
the
absence
of
an
expressed
statement
for
the
contrary.
we
should
not
attribute
to
the
congress
a
purpose
--
a
purpose
to
extend
the
statute
to
regulate
matters
which
the
argument
goes,
deal
with
the
internal
or
to
the
vessel.
we
believe
that
this
argument
misconceives
the
internal
order
doctrine.
that
doctrine
which
of
course
is
an
ancient
one,
has
to
do
with
the
exercise
and
control
of
--
exercise
and
control
and
authority
over
ship,
over
the
vessel,
over
the
passengers,
over
the
crew
and
disciplinary
matters.
the
classic
statement
of
the
doctrine
made
in
the
wildenhus
case
by
chief
justice
waite
is
that
the
doctrine
pertains
to
--
is
that
all
matters
of
discipline
and
all
things
done
onboard
which
affected
only
the
vessel
or
those
belonging
to
her
and
did
not
involve
the
peace
or
dignity
of
the
country
or
the
trend
carried
apart
should
be
left
to
the
authorities
of
the
flag
nation.
now,
we
believe
that
labor
relations
extend
beyond
any
internal
order
of
the
vessel.
they
affect
the
commerce
of
the
coastal
state
or
the
territorial
state
where
the
ship
happens
to
be.
and
in
the
classic
phrase,
we
think
that
labor
disputes
involving
vessels
affect
the
tranquility,
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
coastal
state
and
that
therefore
it
is
not
covered
--
that
these
matters
are
not
covered
by
the
internal
order
doctrine.
now,
of
confirmation
of
this
understanding
of
the
internal
order
doctrine
is
furnished
i
think
by
the
treaty
of
peace
that
exist
between
this
country
and
honduras
which
contains
this
provision
and
i
may
say
that
this
provision
is
typical
of
many
of
the
treaties
that
this
country
has
with
other
treaties
of
friendship
that
this
country
has
with
other
countries.
the
relevant
article
of
that
treaty
provides
--
this
is
at
page
44
of
our
brief,
that
a
counselor
officer
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
controversies
arising
out
of
the
internal
order
of
private
vessels
of
this
county
and
shall
alone
exercise
jurisdiction
in
cases
wherever
arising
between
officers
and
crews
pertaining
to
the
enforcement
of
discipline
onboard
provided
the
vessel
and
that
person
charged
with
wrongdoing
shall
have
entered
as
part
of
his
consular
district.
such
an
officer
shall
also
have
jurisdiction
over
issues
concerning
the
adjustment
of
wages
and
the
execution
of
contracts
relating
thereto,
provided
the
local
laws
so
permit.
this
treaty
itself
seems
to
recognize
the
matters
having
to
do
with
wages,
the
execution
of
labor
contracts
--
of
labor
contracts
that
this
is
not
a
matter
that
is
governed
by
the
internal
order
doctrine.
now,
i
go
on
to
another
argument
that
is
made
against
the
board's
position.
it
is
urged
that
for
the
board
--
for
the
board
to
extend
the
jurisdict
--
its
jurisdiction
to
this
foreign-flag
vessels
to
read
the
statute
as
covering
some
of
these
foreign-flag
vessels
will
necessarily
invite
international
discord,
perhaps
retaliation
and
that
in
the
light
of
these
considerations,
we
should
not
attribute
to
congress
a
purpose
to
extend
the
act
for
these
foreign
flag
vessels,
absent
the
specific
declaration
by
congress
to
that
effect.
now,
this
argument
of
course
is
a
familiar
one
in
this
area.
it
was
made
to
this
court
very
forcefully
by
these
three
departments
of
the
executive
branch
in
the
vermilya-brown
case
that
if
the
fair
labor
standards
act
were
extended
to
a
base
which
is
contrary
at
least
in
bermuda
that
it
would
provoke
all
kinds
of
horrible
things.
the
court
was
not
exactly
overwhelmed
by
the
argument.
and
i
suspect
that
the
reason
the
court
was
not
exactly
overwhelmed
by
the
argument
because
in
large
measure
the
argument
is
a
speculative
one.
in
assessing
this
argument,
i
think
we
must
be
mindful
of
the
fact,
as
i
said
yesterday,
that
the
great
majority
of
these
flag
of
convenience
vessels
have
no
contacts
with
the
flag
nation.
and
the
few
that
do
--
the
few
that
do
as
in
this
case
only
do
so
in
connection
with
the
american
beneficial
owners
operations.
now,
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
certainly,
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
where
the
flag
--
where
the
flag
--
where
the
boats
never
touches
the
flag
nation
shores,
the
--
any
notion
of
international
discord
or
retaliation
or
repercussions
are
perhaps
more
theoretical
than
real
but
to
the
extent
that
there
is
and
i
shall
address
myself
to
your
question
mr.
justice
harlan
to
the
question
--
to
the
extent
that
there
may
be
some
international
discord
on
happiness
over
the
board
--
over
the
extension
of
the
labor
act
of
these
foreign-flag
vessels,
we
think
that
there
is
no
solid
basis,
no
solid
basis
for
attributing
to
congress
an
intent
to
prefer
foreign
interest
at
the
expense
of
american
policy
and
american
interest.
indeed,
quite
the
contrary,
if
the
peaceful
procedures
of
this
statute
are
not
available
for
the
resolution
of
these
industrial
disputes
affecting
these
foreign-flag
vessels,
the
result
would
be
of
course
that
the
parties
will
deal
after
their
economic
weapons
with
a
consequent
disruption
of
american
commerce.
now,
we
think
that
in
these
circumstances,
in
these
circumstances,
there
is
no
compelling
reason,
no
compelling
reason
for
attributing
the
purpose
of
congress
to
sacrifice
american
policy,
what
congress
deem
to
be
good
american
policy
to
sacrifice
american
interest
in
deference
to
the
conflicting
demands
of
a
foreign
country.
i
shall
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
before
i
sit
down,
yes,
i
have
something.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
--
it
wouldn't
be
mooted
because
the
basic
underlying
question
will
still
remain
there
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
as
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
am
--
we
are
--
we
are,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
of
course
we
have
--
we
--
in
the
second
circuit
case
which
was
brought
by
the
company,
by
empresa.
we
had
opposed
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
there
saying
that
under
myers
versus
bethlehem,
the
employer
had
a
proper
way
--
had
a
method
under
our
own
statute
of
litigating
this
issue
without
going
into
a
district
court.
namely,
there
would
have
been
an
election
if
the
election
had
resulted
in
the
certification
of
a
particular
union,
he
could
be
impart
or
refused
to
bargain
unfair
labor
practice
charges
and
complaints
would
have
issued
and
would
have
gone
up
the
ladder
through
the
board.
this
argument
was
rejected
by
the
second
circuit
and
while
we
have
some
very
great
doubts,
very
great
doubts
about
the
correctness
of
that
ruling,
we
have
not
raised
that
issue
here.
we
have
not
raised
that
issue
here
because
we
felt
that
the
--
in
this
case,
the
important
issue,
the
more
significant
issue
for
the
time
being
was
the
question
of
board
jurisdiction
over
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
raises
a
--
it
may
raise
a
law
probably
but
the
union
has
raised
it.
the
union
has
raised
it.
the
n.m.u.
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no
this
is
the
n.m.u.,
the
national
maritime
union
which
is
a
party
for
the
case
and
which
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
its
contract
had
expired
when
the
board's
decision
but
i
understand
that
it's
been
renewed,
it's
been
renewed.
now,
with
the
few
minutes
that
i
have
left,
i
do
want
to
say
a
word
about
this
particular
case.
i
dealt
--
i've
devoted
most
of
my
time
to
what
i
think
is
the
initial
threshold
question
whether
or
not
flag
is
dispositive
of
this
issue
or
whether
it
is
not.
now,
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
case
that
we
have
before
us
here.
if
the
board
is
correct,
if
the
board
is
correct
in
concluding
that
the
flag
is
not
decisive
of
the
applicability
of
the
act
that
the
board
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
applicability
of
the
act
is
to
be
determined
upon
what
i
shall
call
a
contacts
test.
then
we
believe
that
the
accommodation
which
the
board
has
made
in
this
case
is
a
reasonable
one
as
entitled
to
acceptance.
i
will
not
restate
the
facts,
i
will
not
restate
the
facts
but
the
record
here
shows
that
the
empresa,
united
fruit
and
maritime
operations
are
a
single,
integrated
operation
which
is
primarily
based
in
and
directed
from
this
country
and
owned
by
american
enterprise
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation.
empresa
is
nothing
more
i
suggest,
it's
nothing
more
than
a
department
than
a
department
of
united
fruit
and
its
sole
purpose
is
to
further
the
shipping
operations,
the
shipping
operations
of
united
fruit
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation.
now
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
they
didn't
--
they
didn't
say
that
--
they
didn't
say
that
but
empresa
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
they
did
not
pierce
a
corporate
veil
but
as
i
said
yesterday
--
as
i
said
yesterday
your
honor,
empresa
does
not
carry
passengers
or
cargo
on
its
own
account.
its
sole
function
is
to
own
and
operate
these
ships
that
are
beneficially
owned
by
united
fruit
and
its
income
is
derived
with
possibly
few
exceptions
and
they
are
just
possible
exceptions
as
the
record
says.
its
income
is
derived
from
time
charged
with
these
vessels
which
are
time
chartered
almost
exclusively,
almost
exclusively
to
united
fruit.
so
in
a
very
real
sense,
looking
to
the
economic
realities
of
the
situation
that
empresa's
and
to
say
in
a
very
real
sense,
a
department
of
united
fruit
and
functioning
in
order
to
carry
on
the
business
of
united
fruit.
on
these
circumstances,
we
think
the
board
could
properly
say
that
this
shipping
here,
despite
the
context
with
honduras,
despite
the
flag
that
this
shipping
here
is
essentially
the
shipping
of
this
country
but
it
is
not
shipping
which
has
a
truly
foreign
character.
and
that
therefore
the
act
should
apply
to
these
ships.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
they've
all
have
been
corporations
of
one
kind
or
another
that
have
owned
these
ships.
we
have
listed
these
cases
your
honor
in
our
brief
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
would
--
the
answer
would
be
the
same,
the
answer
would
be
the
same
whether
it's
an
individual
that's
carrying
on
the
operation
or
whether
it's
a
corporate
enterprise.
in
either
case,
the
essential
question
for
the
board
is,
is
this
true
to
the
shipping
of
this
country
by
virtue
of
the
substantial
contacts
with
this
nation
on
the
basis
of
the
factors
that
are
outlined?
or
is
it
truly
a
foreign
shipping
venture
which
only
the
exigencies
of
international
trade
bring
to
this
nation's
chores.
before
i
sit
down,
mr.
justice
black
yesterday
asked
me
for
some
figures
having
to
do
with
the
number
of
ships
that
may
have
been
constructed
in
american
shipyards
for
american
interest
which
were
transferred
to
foreign
flags.
we
made
a
hasty
search
for
some
figures
mr.
justice
black
yesterday.
and
in
1961,
the
administrator
of
the
maritime
administration
testifying
before
the
merchant
marine
and
fishery
subcommittee
of
the
united
states
senate,
stated
that
between
1950
and
1960,
39
ships,
each
have
of
12,500
gross
tons
were
constructed
in
u.s.
shipyards
for
companies
controlled
by
u.s.
citizens
and
registered
under
foreign
flags.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
no,
constructed
in
u.s.
shipyards
for
companies
controlled
by
u.s.
citizens
and
registered
under
foreign
flags.
the
number
was
39.
and
this
covers
the
tenure
period
1950
to
1960.
i
think
also
your
honor
asked
me
a
question
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
was
--
your
honor
also
asked
that
question.
apparently,
subsidies
are
not
available
to
ships
that
are
constructed
in
this
country
for
registration
under
foreign
flags.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
yes
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
citation
of
this
hearing?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
offhand,
i
don't.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
in
the
eastern
case,
there
was
not
american
ownership
in
that
case.
+we
have
cited
that
case
in
our
brief.
on
the
other
hand,
american
ownership
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
board
will
assert
jurisdiction
and
this
was
made
clear
by
the
board's
decision
in
the
dalzell
case
which
we
have
appended
to
our
brief.
in
that
case,
the
boat
was
owned
by
american
interest
but
its
contacts
would
--
that
this
country
is
shipping
were
so
highly
of
fortuitous
character
that
the
board
concluded
despite
the
american
ownership,
the
shipping
was
not
that
of
this
country
and
therefore
it
did
not
assert
jurisdiction
over
that
particular
enterprise.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes
sir,
that
was
true
in
the
eastern
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
