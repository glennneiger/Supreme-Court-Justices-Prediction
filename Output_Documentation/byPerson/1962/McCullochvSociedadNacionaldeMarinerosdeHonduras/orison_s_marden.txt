mr.
orison
s.
marden
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
a
division
among
counsel
seated
on
the
same
side
of
the
table
in
this
case
just
as
there
happens
to
be
a
division
within
the
government
of
the
united
states.
for
example,
mr.
cox,
although
arguing
more
persuasively
than
could
i,
the
merits
of
empresa's
case
before
this
court
on
the
facts
of
our
particular
case
has
asked
the
court
to
affirm
on
a
theory
which
in
our
view
as
expressed
by
him
has
no
foundation
in
our
law
or
in
international
law
and
is
based
really
on
a
combination
of
flag
law
with
the
universal
arranging
plus
the
context
test
that
the
board,
as
we
contend,
erroneously
applied
here.
and
mr.
cox
has
affirmed
the
power
of
congress
to
legislate
with
respect
to
labor
relations
in
foreign
countries
on
the
high
seas
which
is
a
thesis
we
deny.
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
manoli,
our
opponent,
has
expressed
the
view
that
this
court
must
face
up
to
the
law
of
the
flag
problem
and
that
somewhat
contrary
to
the
position,
i
think,
expressed
in
his
brief
that
the
law
of
the
flag
is
really
the
controlling
concept
which
either
we
must
affirm
or
deny.
to
me,
the
impact
of
this
case
on
the
world
community
of
nations
can
best
be
seen
if
we
reverse
the
nationalities.
if
we
assume
a
fleet
of
american
flag
vessels
based
in
baltimore,
home
port
baltimore,
flying
between
the
ports
of
this
country
and
honduras
and
other
south
and
central
american
ports
manned
by
american
seamen
represented
by
an
american
union,
the
national
maritime
union,
regulated
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
i
can
hear
the
outcry
from
maine
to
california
if
the
republic
of
honduras
in
that
situation
were
to
assert
the
right
to
handle
labor
relations
and
regulate
labor
relations
upon
our
ships
on
the
high
seas
and
in
the
reports
of
nations
other
than
honduras.
now
my
friends
will
say,
“you
haven't
mentioned
one
little
fact”,
and
that
fact
is
that
in
your
supposititious
case,
the
stock
of
the
ship
owning
company
in
the
united
states
was
owned
by
honduran
interest
and
furthermore,
you
have
time
chartered
your
ships
to
that
honduran
interest.
i
say
it
makes
no
difference
whatsoever.
in
either
case,
we
have
the
stars
and
stripes
over
these
vessels
carrying
the
protection
of
this
country
subject
to
the
regulation
of
our
labor
board
manned
by
american
seamen
and
that
we
would
reject
with
all
the
power
in
our
--
in
our
--
at
hand,
any
attempt
by
another
country
to
interfere
in
that
situation.
now
that
is
precisely,
precisely
what
has
happened
here
in
the
reversed
situation.
for
more
than
20
years,
empresa
and
essentially
a
genuinely
honduran
corporation
as
the
findings
of
the
board
show
independently
operated
all
its
officers
in
honduras,
all
its
directors
in
honduras,
owning
property
in
honduras,
owning
land,
they're
paying
taxes
to
honduras,
owning
these
ships,
a
perfectly
respectable
trade
since
the
memory
of
man,
one
is
not
to
own
ships
and
to
charter
them
out.
this
cooperation
subject
to
honduran
law,
registering
its
vessels
there,
subject
to
a
whole
complex
of
labor
legislation
and
ship
legislation
governing
these
ships,
has
now
been
told
by
an
instrumentality
of
our
government
that
all
these
is
to
be
swept
aside
and
that
each
ships,
at
least
while
they're
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states,
must
conform
to
the
orders
and
regulations
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
yet,
mr.
manoli
tells
this
court
that
none
of
these
intrudes
on
the
sovereignty
of
honduras.
now,
i
won't
go
into
the
facts
in
great
detail.
mr.
cooper
made
a
very
impassioned
plea
on
the
facts,
very
much
the
same
contentions
that
were
made
before
the
board.
the
board
in
large
part
rejected
his
contentions
as
the
findings
of
the
board
show.
board
found
that
empresa
was
independently
operated
and
insofar
as
labor
relations
go
on
the
facts
putting
--
is
leaving
aside
the
erroneous
legal
conclusion
that
the
board
reached.
on
the
facts,
each
and
every
step
in
labor
relations
without
any
exception
whatsoever
were
handled
by
empresa,
empresa
alone.
empresa
hires
his
men
in
honduras.
they
sign
ships
articles
there.
they
--
it
is
a
honduran
crew
entirely
subject
to
the
direction
at
all
times
of
empresa
masters.
the
fact
that
they
are
time
chartered
does
not
detract
in
the
slightest
from
the
responsibility
of
the
shipowner
over
labor
relations,
that's
true
of
every
time
charter
unless
cooper
speaks
of
the
fact
that
the
time
charter
were
here.
the
holder
of
the
time
charter
controls
the
movements
of
the
ship,
well,
of
course
he
does,
of
course
he
does.
that's
true
in
any
case.
that's
true
if
we
have
--
if
we
had
--
if
united
fruit
had
chartered
a
norwegian
vessel
or
a
greek
vessel.
of
course,
it
controls
the
movement
of
the
ship
but
labor
relations
on
those
ships
so
time
chartered
are
handled
by
the
shipowner,
and
that's
universally
true.
now
under
honduran
law
to
which
we
are
subject
as
a
honduran
corporation
and
parenthetically
during
the
recess,
i
have
made
inquiry
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
with
respect
to
whether
an
--
a
u.s.
interest
could
register
under
honduran
law
and
i
believe
i'm
reliably
informed
that
they
could
but
in
that
event,
they
would
of
course
subject
the
entire
operation
to
the
whole
colloquy
of
labor
laws
and
other
regulations
of
honduras
and
with
all
labor
grievances
would
have
to
be
handled
under
the
laws
of
that
country
and
not
under
the
laws
of
our
country.
now
the
board
order
here
is
--
which
is
a
strange
result.
it
directs
that
an
election
be
held
on
these
foreign-flag
ships
on
a
ballot
which
gives
the
unlicensed
seaman
a
choice
between
the
n.m.u.,
a
honduran
union
known
as
sindimar
and
no
union.
now
the
n.m.u.
could
not
possibly
represent
these
seamen
under
honduran
law.
it's
specifically
forbidden
that
any
union
not
composed
of
90%
honduran
citizens
and
not
directed
by
a
full
compliment
of
honduran
citizens
as
officers
and
whose
--
who
has
not
been
recog
--
which
has
not
been
recognized
under
the
laws
of
honduras
cannot,
in
any
case,
in
any
situation,
represent
honduran
citizens.
so
it's
completely
--
mr.
orison
s.
marden
--
aborted.
mr.
orison
s.
marden
i
think
citizens,
yes
sir.
now
that
has
never
been
--
that
has
never
been
denied
since
we
first
brought
it
out
and
i
am
still
puzzled
as
to
why
the
national
maritime
union
continues
a
purs
--
to
pursuit
an
objective
--
pursue
an
objective
which
cannot
possibly
result
in
any
benefit
through
that
union
under
the
conceded
law
of
honduras
and
over
the
protest
of
its
government.
now
the
honduran
union,
sindimar,
contrary
to
what
has
been
said
was
never
a
party
really
to
the
proceeding
before
the
board.
it
sought
to
intervene
long
after
the
hearings
had
been
closed
and
was
on
other
claims
that
it
represented
a
growing
number
of
the
seamen
on
our
ships.
it
was
allowed
to
intervene
by
the
board
without
any
hearing,
without
anybody
having
an
opportunity
to
say
anything
about
it.
it's
a
paper
organization
as
was
said
was
found
in
another
board
proceeding.
it
has
shown
no
interest
in
the
litigation
before
this
court
or
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
third
choice
is
no
union.
but
our
employees
are
members
of
a
honduran
union
with
whom
we
have
an
existing
contract
and
with
which
we've
had
an
existing
contract
for
over
20
years.
and
yet,
they
were
not
under
the
board
order
even
given
the
opportunity
to
vote
for
their
own
union.
now
one
can
imagine
the
chaos
and
the
confusion
of
the
implementation
of
such
an
order
by
our
labor
board.
on
these
--
among
these
unlicensed
seamen,
not
only
coming
into
the
ports
of
this
country
but
under
the
board
order,
the
balloting
was
to
take
place
even
outside
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states.
a
seaman
sitting
in
his
cabin
at
puerto
cortés
in
honduras
would
be
required
to
want
a
ballot
as
prescribed
by
this
--
to
them
of
foreign
administrative
agency.
now,
if
the
board's
theory
that
a
conflicts
test
such
as
the
court
--
this
court
announced
in
lauritzen
is
to
be
applied
here
and
we
say
it
should
not
and
cannot
because
it's
an
entirely
different
situation
but
assuming
that
it
should
be
applied,
then
i
think
mr.
cox
has
presented
a
most
persuasive
and
conclusive
argument
for
the
proposition
that
the
honduran
context
far
outweigh
those
of
this
country
and
that
on
application
of
that
test,
the
judgment
must
be
affirmed.
judge
friendly
found
below
in
this
as
the
solicitor
general
has
argued.
but
the
very
fact
that
we
have
these
differences
illustrates
to
my
mind
the
difficulties
with
applying
the
context
of
test.
here
we
have
the
board
applying
what
they
call
the
lauritzen
rule
and
reaching
a
conclusion
different
from
that
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
differing
from
that,
urged
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
here.
one
can
imagine
if
you
apply
this
internationally,
the
difference
is
in
the
weight
that
honduras
would
give
to
certain
of
the
context
or
venezuela,
or
great
britain
to
those
that
others
would
give.
it's
an
impossible
theory,
i
submit,
that
is
being
urged
on
this
court
and
while
it's
sufficient
for
the
purpose
of
my
case,
i
respectfully
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
is
a
test
that
should
not
be
applied
and
without
basis
in
law.
now
the
flag,
the
flag
rule,
is
one
of
our
most
ancient
in
international
law.
it's
a
rule
that
this
nation
has
followed
since
its
beginning.
it's
a
rule
that
was
followed
long
before
we
were
--
this
nation
was
formed.
it's
a
rule
that
is
universal.
it's
certain.
it's
definite.
everyone
knows
what
it
means.
it
is
not
susceptible
of
the
differences
of
opinion
that
come
from
applying
such
an
uncertain
rule
as
the
context
rule.
now
even
our
enemies
observe
the
law
of
the
flag
and
it
is
the
rule,
we
submit,
that
should
be
applied
here.
now
under
that
rule,
on
the
high
seas
and
in
the
ports
of
the
flag
state,
the
internal
management
of
the
vessel
is
governed
entirely
by
the
law
of
the
flag
state.
some
people
call
it
a
fiction.
is
citizenship
a
fiction?
within
the
territorial
waters
of
a
literal
state,
it's
perfectly
true
that
there
is
power
and
international
law
recognizes
that
power
to
a
limited
degree
to
interfere
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
flag
state
in
such
matters
as
policing
the
harbor
at
local
matters.
in
some
cases,
the
wages
of
seamen
where
there's
a
local
difficulty
with
free
payment
of
wages
and
that
sort
of
thing.
but
with
that
slight
exception,
it
is
the
universal
rule
that
flag
law
governs.
now
why
should
--
mr.
orison
s.
marden
well,
mr.
justice
harlan,
it
is
also
the
cardinal
principle
of
international
law
as
i
understand
it
and
that
has
been
reaffirmed
in
the
convention
of
the
sea
that
geneva
convention
on
the
sea,
that
only
the
sovereign
which
issues
the
registry
--
permits
the
registry
is
confident
to
judge
as
to
its
own
regulations
and
what
it
enforces.
but
there
is
an
admonition
that
came
out
of
the
geneva
convention
that
each
flag
nation
should
actively
assert
its
jurisdiction
and
really,
really
control
the
vessel
and
its
internal
management
by
its
laws
and
regulations.
and
i
submit
that
category
number
four
which
is
given
by
mr.
cox
is
equally
entitled
to
all
the
benefits
that
flow
from
a
flag
registering.
i
think
that
if
there
are
evils
of
any
kind
in
such
registrations,
they
must
be
handled
in
some
other
way.
it's
too
important
in
a
world
that's
grappling
for
agreement
on
many
things
to
let
this
matter
as
to
which
there
has
been
agreement
for
so
many
centuries
as
they
set
aside
by
a
unilateral
action
on
our
part.
we
know
of
no
case
by
any
nation
in
any
jurisdiction
where
a
state
has
sought
to
impose
its
labor
laws
aboard
foreign
flag
vessels.
these
are
--
this
is
the
first
attempt
of
which
we
know
this
attempt
by
the
labor
board.
our
neighbor
canada
had
the
question
before
them
recently.
the
case
is
attached.
the
decision
is
attached
to
canada's
brief
amicus
here.
there,
vessels
of
british
registry
but
owned
by
canadian
interest
100%
and
spending
more
than
six
months
of
each
year
within
canadian
waters
were
held
not
to
be
subject
to
the
labor
laws
of
canada
on
a
state
basis
of
application
of
the
international
rule
of
flag
law
government.
now,
this
court
in
the
benz
case,
it
seems
to
me
has
already
decided
this
one.
a
close
reading
of
that
case
which
makes
a
close
study
of
the
text
of
the
act,
the
congressional
debates,
and
the
canons
of
construction
which
governed
the
construction
of
congressional
legislation,
came
to
the
square
conclusion
that
the
act
was
not
intended
to
reach
out
and
cover
labor
relations
board
foreign
flag,
foreign
ships
manned
by
foreign
crew.
the
fact
that
that
ship
happened
to
be,
as
i
say
temporarily
here,
it
is
not
in
our
view,
the
slightest
consequence
every
vessel
is
here
temporarily
and
it
--
that
is
true
in
any
case.
and
that
illustrates
another
fallacy
in
the
context
rule.
empresa
might
win
this
case
on
the
facts
here.
who
knows
what
will
happen
tomorrow?
who
knows
where
our
stock
may
lodge
tomorrow?
who
knows
where
our
vessels
maybe
time
chartered
and
between
what
ports
they
will
apply
next
year.
well,
in
each
of
these
cases,
we
have
--
well,
we
have
to
come
back
to
the
labor
board
and
have
it
adjudicated
all
over
again
whether
we
are
subject
to
the
laws
of
this
country
or
the
laws
of
honduras.
and
that
can
--
that
sort
of
conjecture
can
be
carried
on
adding
some
item.
and
it
seems
to
me
it
demonstrates
so
clearly
that
flag
law
must
be
the
governing
principle.
now
the
solicitor
general
very
rightly
says
that
this
court
should
not
go
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
don't
suggest
the
contrary.
but
in
deciding
the
case,
if
the
court
decides
it
on
a
theory
which
is
erroneous
and
mischievous,
and
one
that
can
only
lead
to
further
litigation
and
difficulty,
whereas
it
can
be
decided
on
a
simple
universally
applied
rule.
i
would
think
that
the
choice
is
clear
and
it
is
that
choice
that
we
respectfully
urge
upon
the
court.
now,
so
much
has
been
covered
by
the
earlier
argument
that
i
am
going
to
skip
some
things
i
wanted
to
say.
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
an
existing
treaty
between
this
country
and
honduras
which
in
our
view
requires
application
of
flag
law
in
our
situation.
it's
a
statute
which
is
not
noble
to
honduras
and
the
united
states.
it
has
been
applied
in
the
--
it
is
in
existence
here
in
a
number
of
other
cases.
i
think
one
other
--
with
one
other
--
mr.
orison
s.
marden
i
think
article
x,
mr.
justice
black,
which
affirms
the
--
mr.
orison
s.
marden
they
respect
--
it
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
at
pages
--
page
65.
mr.
orison
s.
marden
oh,
i
see.
well,
it's
the
same
treaty.
article
x
affirms
with

mr.
orison
s.
marden
the
last
sentence,
your
honor,
i
think
illustrates
what
i
said
earlier
that
there
is
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
international
law
namely,
that
in
the
port
and
within
the
territorial
waters
of
another
nation,
it
is
recognized
that
local
conditions
would
--
might
--
may
warrant
exercise
of
undoubted
power
to
take
some
action
and
i
think
this
might,
for
example,
have
to
do
with
--
an
illustration
might
be
prepayment
of
wages
which
under
one
of
our
statutes
is
forbidden.
but
--
mr.
orison
s.
marden
i
think
that
there
is
--
there
is
power
within
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states
to
take
action
of
almost
any
kind,
but
international
comity
has
--
so
thus
far
prevented
this
country
and
others
from
taking
any
steps
within
their
territorial
waters
with
respect
to
internal
management
of
foreign-flag
vessels
except
in
certain
limited
areas
and
it's
only
as
a
matter
of
comity
that
i
present
the
argument
as
test
to
what
can
happen
within
territorial
waters.
when
you
go
beyond
territorial
waters,
i
think
there
is
serious
doubt
as
to
the
power
of
congress
to
legislate
with
respect
to
labor
conditions
on
foreign-flag
vessels
on
the
high
seas
and
in
their
home
and
other
ports.
we
present
that
in
our
brief.
it's
--
i
don't
think
that's
ever
going
to
reach
it
because
i
think
the
statutory
construction
points
are
so
strong
that
it's
unnecessary
to
consider
constitutional
points
but
we
do
urge
it
and
we
urge
it
seriously.
we
think
that
--
mr.
orison
s.
marden
commerce,
commerce
power
of
congress.
we
suggest
that
congress
does
not
have
the
power
to
legislate
under
the
commerce
clause
with
respect
to
labor
relations
for
example
in
a
factory
in
honduras.
we
don't
think
the
people
have
the
power
to
give
it
to
congress
in
the
first
place
under
international
law
in
the
context
to
which
our
constitution
was
adopted.
mr.
orison
s.
marden
i
appreciate
as
a
difficult
point
to
your
honor
but
i
think
a
point
is
reached
where
our
sovereign
power
cannot
lawfully
legislate.
and
i
think
that
the
high
seas
on
foreign-flag
vessels
is
such
a
point
and
is
not
different
in
truth
from
legislating
with
respect
to
labor
conditions
in
a
factory
in
honduras
or
on
a
banana
plantation
that
--
in
honduras.
mr.
orison
s.
marden
of
course
we
can
prevent
anything
from
coming
into
this
interest
and
anything
from
going
out.but
when
we
assume
to
govern
relations
between
the
management
and
labor
not
within
our
own
territories
but
in
some
other
part
of
the
world,
it
seems
to
me
that
we've
reached
the
point
that
where
we've
exceeded
our
power.
mr.
orison
s.
marden
yes
your
honor.
now,
as
i've
stated,
we
feel
that
the
benz
--
the
benz
holding
is
controlling
here
and
that
its
application
disposes
of
the
case.
the
labor
laws
of
honduras
have
been
referred
to
earlier
in
the
--
by
the
solicitor
general.
they're
very
elaborate,
very
complex,
very
detailed,
very
foreign,
and
empresa
and
its
employees
are
subject
to
those
laws,
all
labor
grievances
must
be
processed
before
the
labor
courts
of
honduras
and
in
the
ministry
of
labor.
and
this
board
order,
of
course,
in
its
element
effect,
if
it's
sustained,
not
only
requires
us
in
precedent
to
breach
its
contract
with
the
honduran
union
with
whom
it
has
and
has
had
an
existing
contract
but
also
would
require
us
to
violate
the
law
of
honduras
in
a
number
of
respects.
the
board's
order
sows
the
seeds
as
judge
friendly
said
below
of
continuous
conflict
between
the
regulatory
measures
of
two
jurisdictions.
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
so
persuasively
i
thought
that
it
is
impossible
in
this
area
and
to
have
a
workable
arrangement
whereby
two
nations
governed
the
labor
relations
of
--
on
a
--
aboard
vessels.
you
could
have
them
changing
from
port
to
port
and
--
rather
than
assist
the
free
flow
of
commerce,
you
will
be
putting
a
straightjacket
on
congress
--
on
commerce.
certainly,
we
couldn't
enforce
it
beyond
the
three-mile
limit.
honduras
could
send
a
gunboat
up
here
and
take
charge
as
soon
as
they
got
outside
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states.
now,
we've
raised
as
i've
already
indicated
some
constitutional
questions.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
go
into
them
in
argument.
they're
in
reserve.
we've
urged
them
from
the
beginning.
a
question
of
jurisdiction
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
hasn't
been
referred
to
by
our
opponents.
it
is
our
view
that
(inaudible)
sustained
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
there
as
the
court
will
recall,
a
union
brought
suit
to
vacate
a
board
order
which
has
been
issued
in
violation
of
statutory
command
and
as
mr.
justice
whitaker
pointed
out
the
sole
and
narrow
question
presented
was
whether
the
board
had
acted
in
excess
of
its
power.
we
say
here
that
the
board
did
act
in
excess
of
its
powers
and
if
there
ever
was
a
case
where
a
court
should
have
stepped
in
when
it
did,
this
was
that
case
because
if
this
election
had
proceeded,
the
fact
would've
been
in
the
fire.
the
point
to
honduras
would've
occurred.
the
breach
of
contract,
our
breach
of
contract
would
have
occurred.
our
violation
of
law
with
honduran
law
would
have
occurred.
if
we
say
the
rule
is
the
same
for
employer
and
employee
and
as
judge
friendly
pointed
out
below.
and
parenthetically,
i
think
it's
of
interest
with
all
the
talk
of
avoiding
the
delay
of
judicial
action
that
as
mr.
cooper
pointed
out,
we
were
two
years
in
obtaining
a
decision
of
the
labor
board,
i
say
that
without
any
criticism.
the
board
decision
here
came
down
on
november
17th.
the
district
court
took
two
days
to
dispose
of
our
application
for
a
temporary
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
acted
on
january
the
12th
so
that
we
were
in
fact
ready
for
this
court
within
two
months
following
the
entry
of
the
board
decision.
for
the
reasons
given,
we
respectfully
urge
a
premise
and
we
particularly
urge
upon
the
court
that
flag
law
should
be
the
decisive
basis
for
your
premise.
