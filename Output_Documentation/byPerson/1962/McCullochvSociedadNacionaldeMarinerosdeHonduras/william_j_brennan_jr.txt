justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
mr.
manoli,
is
there
anything
else
about
what
empresa
does
in
honduras
besides
the
--
i
gather
you
told
us,
they
dock
the
ship
there,
man
it
there,
anything
else
that
empresa
does
in
honduras
itself?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
they
have
a
headquarters
or
something
in
honduras?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
some
of
it
is
done
in
honduras?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
record
doesn't
show?
but
i
gather,
in
any
event,
there
are
enough
contacts
with
honduras
to
distinguish
this
particular
case
from
other
cases
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
there's
nothing
but
a
flag
of
convenience
and
no
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
connection
whatever
with
the
flag
country.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
the
board
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
who
might
that
--
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
board's
view,
would
that
make
a
difference?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
manoli,
this
is
the
representation
proceeding.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
marineros
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
covering
these
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there's
no
problem
with
the
contract
part?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
suppose
you
could
--
the
board
would've
considered
it
anyway.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
just
wondering
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
it
might
well
be
that
--
you
might
not
on
the
facts
of
these
cases,
that
it
doesn't
follow
that
--
it
could
be
the
same
result
in
one
of
these
instances
where
--as
i
understand
it,
they
merely
fly
the
flag
and
never
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
going
to
take
any
issue
of
the
court
of
appeals'
contrary
conclusion
to
the
board
that
this
employee
--
that
this
empresa
and
united
fruit
were
joint
employers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
of
course
if
that's
the
fact
then
none
of
these
arguments
are
relevant,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that
should
be
the
fact,
then
we
don't
reach
the
questions
that
you're
talking
about,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
if
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
they're
also
employees
of
united
fruit,
and
do
we
have
all
these
concerns?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
of
course
involves
the
injunction
against
conduct
in
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
if
the
election
went
on,
the
problem
at
least
where
this
case
could
be
mooted
if
the
vote
were
no
union,
couldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
puzzles
me.
apparently,
you're
very
anxious
to
have
us
decide
the
basic
underlying
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you're
not
taking
any
position
with
regard
to
the
--
whether
it's
a
jurisdictional
or
it
may
be
the
injunction
against
an
election.
isn't
that
premature
in
--
even
in
leedom
and
kyne
terms?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
over
the
fact
that
you
haven't
raised
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
fact
that
you
have
not
raised
it
at
present
or
was
that
for
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
told
us
yesterday
the
union's
contract
were
undoubtedly
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
marineros
or
whatever
that
name
is
these
contracts
went
out
in
february.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
there
been
any
efforts
to
get
the
legislation
and
that
guaranteed
ship
owners
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
the
foreign
flag?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)400
vessels
in
this
whole
category?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
your
position
is
sustained
as
to
empresa
that
probably
will
take
care
of
most
of
the
concerns
of
the
nations
that
have
filed
amicus
briefs.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
you
--
excuse
me.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
go
ahead.
surely.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
underlying
ones
under
agreement
in
the
event
of
emergency
to
come
back.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
i
gather
that
certainly
defense
and
the
labor
board
are
completely
at
odds.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
do
you
agree
with
mr.
manoli
too
that
there's
no
occasion
for
us
to
reach
the
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
lower
court
to
issue
an
injunction
against
an
election
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
the
boards
position
involved
in
the
extension
of
leedom
and
kyne?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
no.
but
this
does,
apart
from
that.
i'm
familiar
with
your
views.
but
apart
from
that,
this
certainly
does
involve
an
extension
of
the
principle
of
leedom
and
kyne.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
there
ever
before
been
--
has
the
board
ever
before
exceeded
to
an
injunction
against
the
conduct
of
election?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
the
system.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
mean
to
take
so
much
of
your
time.
i
believe
i'm
sure
not
disagreeing
with
the
board's
position
on
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
marden
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
honduran
law
is
that
the
crew
must
be
honduran
citizens
and
not
really
honduran
vessels?
