(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
this
development
(inaudible)
in
fact,
one
way
or
the
other,
on
the
tax
aspect
of
a
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
lauritzen
case
involve
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
the
materials
involved
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
before
you
get
to
benz.
justice
john
m.
harlan
may
i
ask
you,
is
there
anything
in
the
history
of
the
labor
act
that
shows
that
congress
adverted
to
this
problem?
justice
john
m.
harlan
nothing
at
all.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
whether
that's
impossible
or
united
fruit
under
honduran
law
to
simply
have
their
vessels
apply
the
honduran
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
so
they
have
the
vessels
operating
in
honduras?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
not
under
honduras
flag?
justice
john
m.
harlan
could
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
it
is
the
injunction
of
the
district
of
columbia
case
refer
to
the
same
certification
as
the
two
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
you've
got
two
injunctions
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
it
would
be
conceivably
possible
to
decide
this
case
on
either
one
of
those.
justice
john
m.
harlan
it
is
--
and
it's
the
other
one
that
presents
the
employer
situation.
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course
the
kind
of
a
case
as
i
understand
it,
the
solicitor
general
says
need
not
be
decided
here
is
the
situation
where
in
effect
the
foreign
nation
licenses
out
its
flag
to
somebody
else.
