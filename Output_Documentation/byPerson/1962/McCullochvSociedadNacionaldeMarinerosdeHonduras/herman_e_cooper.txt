mr.
herman
e.
cooper
may
the
court
please.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
the
national
maritime
union
which
is
the
intervenor
in
this
proceeding
and
which
in
fact
initiated
the
conduct
by
the
board
which
in
turn
has
been
suppressed
by
injunction
by
the
courts.
in
fact,
we
started
this
in
november
1959
when
having
procured
a
majority
of
the
cards
of
honduran
seamen
in
the
maine,
aboard
some
17
empresa
vessels.
we
filed
a
petition
for
an
election
with
the
board
and
what
appeared
to
have
become
a
vain
hope
that
we
would
promptly
have
an
election
and
ultimately
emerge
as
the
certified
bodily
representative
for
the
seamen.
two
years
later,
november
15th,
1961,
the
board
ordered
for
this
election.
in
the
meantime,
some
four
ships
had
dropped
from
the
fleet
and
the
status
of
our
union
with
respect
to
the
seamen
today
is
a
relatively
uncertain
one,
however,
if
an
election
is
ultimately
ordered,
we
intend
of
course
to
proceed
actively
in
it.
now,
in
selecting
the
board
as
the
vehicle
for
this
operation
of
becoming
the
bargaining
representative
for
the
empresa
seaman,
we
attempted
to
utilize
the
orderly
processes
available
to
us
instead
of
proceeding
by
economic
pressure
to
accomplish
the
same
result.
necessarily
what
i
have
to
say
will
be
a
factual
footnote
to
the
arguments
of
counsel
for
the
board.
i
think
that
with
all
great
respect,
he
has
covered
the
important
case
law,
the
statutes
but
the
one
aspect
of
this
case
which
requires
amplification
of
the
real
underlying
facts.
in
this
instance,
the
primacy
of
the
facts,
i
submit,
would
deal
directly
with
the
key
determination
by
this
court.
and
these
facts
assumed
in
decreased
importance
because
they
were
not
available
to
any
of
the
courts
below
by
the
curious
situation
that
the
board
record
was
not
before
the
courts
either
in
new
york
or
washington.
it
was
not
before
the
court
of
appeals.
it
is
before
this
court
by
stipulation
or
by
certification
of
the
parties
and
therefore
references
which
i
will
make
to
that
record
will
necessarily
be
references
primarily
directed
to
the
record
before
the
board.
now,
the
board
did
not
act
in
haste.
the
board
had
two
years
from
the
day
we
filed
our
petition
to
come
to
the
conclusion
which
it
did.
the
hearing
commenced
shortly
after
the
filing
of
our
petition
and
it
took
two
years,
let
me
underscore
this,
before
the
board
and
the
commission
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
had
jurisdiction
of
this
case
and
that
it
should
order
an
election.
by
the
same
token,
it
took
the
courts
just
about
a
week
or
two
at
the
most
to
decide
that
the
election
should
not
be
held.
the
absence
of
this
board
record
before
the
courts
below
may
have
led
to
the
critical
error
which
we
feel
is
inherent
in
their
decisions
and
that
is
the
rejection
of
the
board's
finding
that
these
ships
operate
as
the
face
of
the
united
states
enterprise
under
and
i
quote
“the
continuous
direct
control”
and
either
direct
or
ultimate
ownership
of
united
fruit.
now,
the
--
these
facts
assume
even
greater
importance
because
if
empresa
stands
as
an
independent
entity
which
is
the
framework
in
which
our
adversaries
view
it
necessarily
and
therefore
united
fruit
is
not
the
employee
or
even
the
joint
employer.
it
provides
the
whole
framework
of
argument
for
claiming
that
sovereignty
of
honduras
floats
this
corporate
entity
and
therefore
makes
it
immune
from
the
operations
of
the
board.
all
of
this
is
predicated
on
a
honduran
corporation,
on
a
honduran
flag,
on
the
main
honduran
crew
and
the
fact
that
they
carry
honduran
products.
and
we
submit
that
while
these
facts
are
important,
while
these
facts
may
bear
on
the
ultimate
issue
that
they're
overcome
by
the
real
issue.
and
the
real
issue
is
defined
in
the
record
before
the
board
that
that
captures
the
realities
of
the
case
and
discloses
the
true
relationship
between
empresa
and
united
fruit
and
united
states
commerce.
now,
what
is
significant
here
is
that
united
fruit
is
not
a
stranger
for
the
national
maritime
union.
back
in
february
1938,
we
were
certified,
1938
as
the
exclusive
collective
bargaining
representative
for
all
seamen,
unlicensed
seamen
aboard
united
fruit
vessels.
it
took
us
some
eight
months
and
wasn't
until
october
of
that
same
year
before
we
achieved
the
contract
with
united
fruit.
and
we
are
and
have
been
since
that
time,
the
exclusive
collective
bargaining
representative
for
the
unlicensed
seamen
aboard,
the
american-flag
vessels
of
united
fruit.
there
are
some
20
of
them
today
and
it
covers
some
800
seamen.
and
we
will
demonstrate
from
the
board
record
that
there
is
a
single
fleet
operating
here
which
is
combined
as
part
of
empresa
ships
and
american
ships
under
the
direct
united
fruit
control.
and
that
while
they
may
be
dual
flags,
there
is
a
single
centralized
control
and
that
this
whole
operation
is
by
virtue
of
the
decision
not
of
empresa,
not
of
honduras
but
of
united
fruit.
and
united
fruit
itself
has
created
the
situation
because
by
perhaps
no
strange
coincidence,
only
three
years
after
we
got
our
first
contract,
they
suddenly
created
the
honduran
corporation
known
as
empresa
and
that
honduran
corporation
is
the
one
that
we're
dealing
with
now.
they
own
all
the
stock
in
empresa.
they
dominate
empresa
completely.
they
named
the
boards
of
directors
who
in
turn
select
the
officers.
the
empresa
itself
is
a
mere
shadow
of
united
fruit.
united
fruit
itself
as
its
well-known
is
a
colossus
which
travels
in
four
continents.
it
operates
through
some
50
or
60
varied
subsidiaries
of
which
empresa
is
one.
its
main
business
is
the
growing,
the
transporting
and
the
marketing
of
probable
produce
enacting
as
a
shipper
of
cargo.
the
bulk
of
its
trade
is
between
central
and
south
america
and
the
united
states
and
it
ships
its
own
good
and
also
solicits
general
cargo
from
others.
but
the
produce
which
it
carries
is
either
carried
in
ships
which
it
owns
directly
or
which
at
time
charters
from
others.
and
this
is
where
its
relationship
operatively
with
empresa
comes
in.
because
united
fruit
not
being
exclusively
a
holding
company
but
being
actively
an
operating
company,
also
runs
these
50
or
60
subsidiaries
through
this
american
central
agency
which
in
turn
exercises
close
control
and
supervision
over
the
acts
of
all
of
its
subordinates
including
empresa.
and
empresa
has
no
independent
existence.
it's
completely
subordinate
to
the
united
fruit
and
it
could
exercise
no
choice
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
decisions
and
will
and
wish
of
united
fruit.
it's
--
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
use
or
the
way
to
operate
may
be
a
misconduct.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
it
does
nothing.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
that's
all
it
does.
it
has
this
at
present
12
ships
or
13
ships.
it
time
charters
them
to
its
--
as
a
captive
corporation
of
united
fruit.
united
fruit
decides
what
to
do
with
it.
they
sail
side-by-side.
they
dock
side-by-side,
they're
utilized
as
part
of
an
integrated
system
of
one
company
and
that
is
united
fruit,
american-owned.
now
even
in
the
--
in
the
annual
stockholders
report
filed
by
united
fruit,
it
refers
to
these
empresa
vessels
as
its
own,
built
to
its
own
specifications.
united
fruit
in
filing
the
specifications
and
financial
data
required
by
801
of
the
merchant
marine
act,
shipping
act,
files
detailed
financial
reports
again
as
to
its
vessels
and
includes
within
those
characterizations,
the
empresa
fleet.
the
entire
capital
of
empresa
has
been
provided
and
continues
to
be
provided
by
united
fruit.
vessels
are
transferred
to
empresa
by
united
fruit.
empresa
has
no
other
relationship
with
anyone
else
except
with
the
united
fruit.
and
let
me
underscore
this
fact
that
by
controlling
where
empresa
operates
and
how
it
operates.
in
effect,
united
fruit
selected
honduras
and
thereby
itself
assume
whatever
burden
might
attach
to
having
business
in
an
area
in
which
--
from
which
may
emerge
dual
claims
of
two
sovereignties.
and
certainly,
united
fruit,
just
as
it
created
the
situation,
could
terminate
it
tomorrow
because
the
exercise
of
this
kind
of
dominance
constructively
and
actively
over
the
empresa
fleet.
now,
marc
hetu
is
the
vice
president
and
let
me
say
at
this
point
that
the
officers
of
united
fruit
testified
to
the
board,
it's
so
fully
and
fairly
and
their
testimony
is
primarily
the
testimony
in
which
the
board
has
to
rely.
the
documents
were
provided
by
united
fruit
and
their
testimony
came
from
their
officers.
they
knew
the
fact.
and
marc
have
testified
that
all
that
empresa
has
ever
done
to
corporate
life
is
to
be
the
nominal
owner
of
certain
vessels
which
has
then
chartered
the
united
fruit,
lies
the
flag
of
honduras
and
mans
the
ships
period,
receives
the
income
from
it.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
well,
it's
the
nominal
owner
because
an
actual
owner
must
necessarily
be
considered
to
be
as
the
board
found,
either
directly
or
indirectly.
the
beneficial
ownership
is
the
united
fruit.
united
fruit
provides
the
funds.
united
fruit
can
withdraw
the
fund.
united
fruit
has
the
position
by
its
control
of
empresa
to
determine
the
size
of
the
fleet
of
empresa,
where
it
will
go
and
whether
it
will
continue.
empresa
never
procured
cargo
for
its
own
vessels,
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
loading
or
discharging
of
cargo.
and
as
one
of
their
witnesses
i
think
it
was
mr.
sisto
(ph)
testified.
empresa
is
owned
glock,
stock,
and
barrel
by
united
fruit.
now
there
is
no
intangible
evidence
in
this
record
of
any
independent
existence
or
a
shadow
of
claim
to
such
independence
which
would
entitle
empresa
to
come
before
this
court
and
say
that
we
are
a
separate
entity.
we
are
entitled
to
this
thing
of
immunity
because
we
happened
to
fly
the
honduran
flag.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
well,
of
course,
i
think
if
we
were
to
view
the
realities
and
their
proper
context
is
--
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
no,
they're
the
owner.
the
tax
advantage
--
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
well,
only
because
they
own
all
the
stock
of
empresa.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
for
insurance,
they
get
all
of
the
virtues
and
advantages
of
the
honduran
registry
but
none
of
the
responsibility
for
actual
direct
ownership.
but
they
exercise
the
control
it's
so
dominating
that
for
all
the
purposes
certainly
under
the
act,
they
should
either
be
regarded
as
the
employer
or
--
sir?
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
right,
exactly.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
those
really
follow
the
corporate
law.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
of
course.
we
are
naturally
confined
to
the
narrow
limits
of
what
constitutes
an
employer
under
the
act.
now,
this
is
significant
above
all
other
as
to
the
real
nature
of
this
relationship
between
the
smeared
reflection
known
as
empresa
and
united
fruit.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
sound
argument
because
in
the
commercial
side
of
the
case
where
the
real
beneficial
ownership
and
stock
control
whether
united
fruit
with
the
kind
of
dominance
which
is
here
demonstrated,
it
might
be
under
commercial
law
that
such
a
credible
proceeding
against
united
fruit.
unfortunately,
that
is
not
our
problem.
this
is
not
a
company
likely
to
be
involved
with
creditors
of
that
carrier.
now,
this
to
me
is
the
most
significant
and
i
submit
it
invites
the
attention
of
the
court.
empresa,
unlike
any
independent
shipping
company
or
corporation,
does
not
hold
out
its
vessels
in
the
world
charter
markets
is
available.
every
one
of
its
vessels
is
limited
to
being
time
chartered
to
united
fruit.
it
has
no
arm's
length
relationship.
it
has
no
competitive
position.
it
can't
bargain
about
what
the
time
rates
shall
be.
it
is
limited
entirely
to
serving
the
purposes
and
objective
and
the
advantages
of
united
fruit.
and
the
income
of
empresa
comes
only
from
the
source.
now,
as
the
court
well
know,
time
chartering
nearly
means
that
you
lease
a
vessel
with
the
crew
and
supply.
united
fruit
has
the
choice
because
of
its
dominant
position
to
bareboat
these
chartes.
bareboat
--
bareboat
chartered
these
vessels
from
empresa
which
in
effect
would
mean
that
united
fruit
would
then
be
the
active
open
operator
of
these
vessels.
but
united
fruit
makes
the
decision
not
to
bareboat
them
because
this
would
immediately
put
these
vessels
under
the
contract
which
united
fruit
now
has
with
the
national
maritime
union.
and
therefore,
united
fruit
has
consistently
made
this
choice
to
avoid
contracting
relations
with
the
n.m.u.
on
this
vessel
that
it
will
only
time
charter,
trusting
in
this
way
to
avoid
the
consequences
of
a
bareboat
charter
and
such
relationship.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
and
to
bareboat
them
to
the
--
to
united
fruit,
though.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
yes,
i
think
the
united
fruit
that
has
property
in
honduras,
there's
no
restriction.
there
are
some
restrictions
under
honduran
law
with
respect
to
the
unions
which
may
represent
its
employees
and
the
nature
of
the
labor
relations
which
it
should
prevail.
but
there's
no
restrictive
legislation
that
i
know
of
and
i
may
be
an
error
which
prohibits
united
fruit
from
owning
these
vessels
actually
before
1941,
your
honor.
they
did
operate
vessels
of
american
flag
registry
in
honduras
as
they
do
now.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
under
honduran
flag.
my
impression
and
i'm
not
in
the
position
to
respond
accurately.
my
impression
is
that
they
could,
that
united
fruit
could
own
the
vessels
under
the
honduran
registry.
now,
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
the
control,
the
operative
control
of
what
happens
to
these
vessels
once
they're
time
chartered
to
united
fruit.
ostensibly,
the
master
is
the
one
and
responsible
for
the
internal
order
and
control
of
the
operations
of
that
vessel
but
the
master
himself
is
subject
to
the
direction
of
united
fruit,
perhaps
not
directly.
but
as
one
of
the
witnesses
testified
on
behalf
of
united
fruit,
it
would
be
surprising
if
empresa
did
not
fulfill
a
request
coming
from
united
fruit
and
it
would
certainly
be
surprising
if
united
fruit
would
supposedly
demonstrate
dominance
of
empresa,
could
not
impose
its
will
directly
or
directly
on
the
master
of
the
vessel.
because
the
master
takes
his
reports
and
orders
from
the
united
fruit
marine
department
which
is
based
in
the
united
states
and
which
is
the
overall
agency
which
in
turn
passes
upon
and
determines
the
operations
of
its
entire
fleet.
it's
this
united
fruit
marine
department
and
this
is
the
test
as
to
what
is
the
unit
here,
solicits
general
cargo
business,
schedules
run,
fixes
destination,
departure
and
arrival
times.
all
in
the
same
trade
routes
with
the
use
of
the
same
docks
and
terminal
facilities
for
both
united
states
and
honduran-flag
vessel.
the
cargo
and
the
passenger
rates
are
set
by
this
united
fruit
marine
division,
the
same
for
all
vessels
both
united
states
and
honduras.
and
the
united
fruit
uses
these
honduran
vessels
interchangeably
with
its
united
states
flag
vessels
for
the
same
cargo
and
the
same
ports
and
the
decision
as
to
which
vessel
shall
be
utilize
by
this
marine
department
does
not
depend
on
the
flag
but
on
the
availability,
the
size,
and
the
speed
of
the
vessel.
the
supplies
which
go
into
these
ships
both
honduran
as
well
as
united
states
flag
are
principally
brought
in
the
united
states
from
another
subsidiary
of
united
fruit,
maritrop
trading
corporation.
the
food
is
purchased
in
the
same
source
whether
it's
the
united
states
ship
or
a
honduran-flag
vessel.
they're
both
dry-docked
and
repaired
usually
in
the
united
states
as
united
fruit
decides.
and
as
this
whole
question
of
do
we
really
have
an
independent
entity
is
sharply
revealed
by
this
following
circumstance
that
united
fruit
in
this
constant
testimony
of
united
fruit,
witnesses
makes
all
decisions
as
to
capital
improvements
or
the
acquiring
of
old
or
new
united
fruit
ships
or
empresa
ships.
all
funds
are
advanced
by
united
fruit
to
acquire
new
ships.
united
fruit
decides
the
capital
expenditures
and
substantial
operational
changes
for
empresa.
it
decides
the
size
of
the
empresa
fleet
whether
it
should
expand,
whether
it
should
be
eliminated
in
its
own
interest.
it
transfers
the
ships
to
other
united
fruit
subsidiaries
or
to
other
companies
without
any
indication
that
empresa
itself
exercises
any
choice
in
this
matter.
now,
i'm
certain
it's
going
to
be
argued
by
our
adversaries
that
this
is
a
characteristically
time
charter
relationship
that
exist
between
empresa
and
united
fruit.
but
i
defy
them
to
demonstrate
another
time
charter
relationship
which
gives
to
the
charter
this
absolute
control
over
life
and
death
and
existence
and
the
dominance
which
is
revealed
by
the
record
as
existing
between
united
fruit
ostensibly
a
hiree
from
--
a
hirer
from
empresa
of
its
vessel.
during
world
war
ii
when
the
u.s.
war
shipping
administration
as
the
requisition
vessels.
it
requisitioned
these
empresa
vessels
for
our
war
service
as
controlled
by
united
fruit.
in
fact
it
made
the
demand
on
united
fruit
and
not
on
empresa.
and
even
the
contract
which
you
--
some
reference
has
been
made
to
ostensibly
in
existence
between
sociedad,
the
honduran
union
and
empresa.
but
article
xii
provides
that
wages
to
these
honduran
seamen
shall
be
paid
in
u.s.
currency,
its
schedule
of
wages
is
all
scaled
to
the
american
dollar
and
it
provides
the
defending
payments
that
are
being
made
in
equivalence,
it's
an
equivalence
in
lempiras
or
in
the
currency
prevailing
in
the
place
of
payment
but
the
base
calculation
is
the
american
dollar.
all
other
benefits
in
the
same
contract,
so-called
contract,
are
similarly
geared
for
the
dollar
and
not
to
the
local
currency,
the
lempiras.
and
in
the
same
contract
under
article
xviii,
it
provides
that
a
vessel's
requisition
or
under
--
or
not
even
requisition
or
under
war
conditions
that
the
seaman
get
the
identical
bonus
as
to
death
or
disability
compensation
as
seaman
employed
in
the
u.s.
merchant
marine.
however,
the
identification
is
not
casual.
this
is
not
the
normal
relationship
which
you
can
anticipate
between
a
so-called
independent
foreign
entity
and
an
american
corporation.
this
is
if
anything
a
captive
corporation,
subordinate
to
and
subject
completely
to
the
dominance
of
united
fruit.
and
this
catalogue
of
facts,
i
submit,
effectively
destroys
the
image
of
empresa
as
an
independent
entity
and
supports
the
board's
conclusion
of
full
integration
and
operation
in
which
empresa
and
united
fruit
are
under
the
most
generous
construction
joint
employers.
and
that
this
honduran
corporation
is
nothing
but
a
tool
and
instrumentality
of
united
fruit
subject
to
its
absolute
control.
left
with
only
one
function
and
that
is
to
serve
the
purposes
of
united
fruit
which
in
this
case
seeks
to
hide
behind
its
own
subsidiary
corporation
in
honduras.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
no,
if
there
were,
we'd
have
no
complaint,
your
honor.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
let
me
give
you
the
--
the
pay
to
a
honduran
seaman
working
side-by-side,
ship
by
ship
is
approximately
25%
of
that
paid
to
american
seaman
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
same
cargo
rates,
the
same
passenger
rates
prevail
on
whether
the
ship
is
a
honduran
ship
or
an
american
ship.
now,
from
these
facts,
the
facts
in
the
record
before
the
board
which
were
considered
by
the
board
for
almost
two
years,
they
properly
concluded
and
i
cannot
improve
on
the
language
of
the
summary
made
by
the
board.
empresa's
maritime
operations
are
a
part
of
a
single
integrated
maritime
operation
under
the
continuous
direct
control
and
either
direct
or
ultimate
ownership
of
united
fruit
and
are
an
essential
part
of
seagoing
enterprise
located
in
and
directed
from
the
united
states
and
engage
in
the
commerce
of
this
nation.
and
the
board
further
observed,
that
and
i
quote,
“the
relationship
between
united
fruit
and
empresa
is
one
in
which
the
affairs
of
the
subsidiary
are
designed
essentially
to
further
the
shipping
operations
that
are
apparent
and
not
one
in
which
empresa
is
considered
an
independent
undertaking
whose
success
or
failure
is
gauged
by
its
role
in
the
open
market.
empresa
vessels
are
utilized
by
united
fruit
as
an
integral
and
necessary
part
of
its
fleet
of
vessels
and
not
chartered
as
an
alternative
to
acquiring
vessels
elsewhere
or
only
to
meet
particular
contingencies
that
may
arise.
in
short,
the
board
found
that
they
are
joint
employers
of
the
affected
crew
members.
and
certainly,
as
such
joint
employers,
the
effect
of
that
relationship
submits
and
subjects
this
company
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
and
entitles
us
to
what
we
have
been
seeking
for
two
years,
and
namely
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
that
a
majority
of
the
crew
members
of
honduran
nationality
or
otherwise
desire
to
be
represented
by
the
national
maritime
union.
now,
let
us
examine,
if
i
may,
advert
to
its
impractical
consequences
that
flow
from
this
controversy.
assume
that
the
board's
jurisdiction
is
upheld.
assume
if
you
will
and
as
we
hope
that
an
election
ultimately
comes
here
while
we're
all
still
around
and
that
in
this
election,
the
national
maritime
union
emerges
as
the
choice
of
the
majority
of
the
seamen.
what
happens
then
and
this
is
a
practical
problem
with
which
we
are
very
much
concerned.
now,
we
then
engage
under
the
law
in
collective
bargaining
with
empresa
and
with
united
fruit
or
both.
they're
not
required
by
law
to
reach
agreement
with
us.
all
they
required
by
law
to
do
is
to
bargain
with
us
in
good
faith.
they're
not
obliged
to
reach
any
specific
understanding
as
to
any
particular
condition
of
the
agreement.
all
they're
obliged
to
do
is
to
demonstrate
that
they're
sitting
with
us
and
that
--
within
the
limits
where
the
legal
or
otherwise
are
contractual.
they're
trying
to
reach
some
understanding.
what
are
we
really
interested
in
here?
as
the
union
of
american
seamen,
were
primarily
concerned
with
seeing
that
their
wage
rates
in
some
measure
not
entirely
equal
because
this
is
unlikely
but
approximate
more
than
25%
of
the
scales
which
we
now
receive
and
which
their
scales
act
constantly
as
a
depressing
impact
and
threat
to
our
own
existence
in
this
economy,
so
that
the
practical
consequences
are
that
we
will
reach
some
agreement
on
wages.
we
already
have
dealt
with
their
parent
organization
since
1938.
we
don't
have
to
negotiate
with
united
fruit.
and
once
united
fruit
comes
from
behind
as
the
side
of
empresa,
we're
not
concerned
that
we'll
reach
agreement
with
them
and
that
this
agreement
will
be
as
every
agreement
is
and
the
accommodation
by
all
parties
to
the
realities
of
the
economic
situation.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
the
wage
rates
of
the
empresa
seamen?
they
are
fixed
ostensibly
by
agreement
between
the
sociedad
which
claims
to
be
its
--
the
collective
bargaining
representative
and
empresa
in
honduras.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
no,
there
is
no
--
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
no,
this
is
a
private
law
of
private
contract
entirely
just
as
--
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
no
legal
regulation
as
to
wages.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
none
at
all.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
now,
the
plaintiff's
arguments
of
the
intrusion
into
honduran
sovereignty,
i
submit
are
really
political
arguments
and
not
just
the
ship.
they
belonged,
may
i
say,
in
the
halls
of
congress
rather
than
here
although
i
appreciate
that
this
court
necessarily
is
concerned
with
the
impact
of
its
decisions
on
our
political
life.
but
whatever
retaliation
is
threatened,
it
cannot
be
real
or
substantial,
we're
always
in
friction
with
other
countries.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
well,
i
say
it
not
to
strengthen
my
position
but
because
this
is
what
i
consider
--
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
yes,
i
do.
we
do
recognize
this
reality
and
this
is
what
i
hope
to
deal
with
now.
it
is
a
reality
but
the
extent
of
the
reality
is
one
which
necessarily
diminishes
the
possibility
of
impact.
now,
congress
itself
had
been
motivated
or
continued
to
be
motivated
by
this
vague
anxieties
of
retaliation.
we
wouldn't
have
many
other
laws
which
rough
against
the
sensibilities
or
the
sense
of
sovereignty
which
other
countries
feel.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
no,
we
haven't
because
we're
satisfied
now
with
the
language
in
the
act.
and
the
in
--
the
interesting
question
might
well
be
addressed
to
our
friends
here.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
not
yet.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
well,
this
specific
fight
had
been
going
on
--
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
i
think
it
has
--
it
clearly
became
amplified
following
the
first
world
war
or
the
second
world
war
when
we
have
a
rush
of
escape
panlibhon
shippers
to
attach
to
themselves
the
advantages
of
foreign
tax
advantages
as
well
as
the
low
wage
rates,
lower
insurance
rates,
less
require
--
less
stringent
requirements
on
safety
measures
and
what
have
you,
all
of
which
attached
to
the
panlibhon
fleets.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
well,
there
had
been
hearings.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
there
had
been
hearings
at
the
press
--
at
the
cabinet
level,
a
consideration
of
this
problem.
there
had
been
certainly
a
great
number
of
hearings
in
congress.
in
fact,
in
19
--
when
the
14
(c)
of
the
labor
act
was
passed,
it
was
passed
by
congress
with
full
knowledge
of
what
this
problem
was
and
the
congress
themselves
made
no
change
in
the
act.
it
merely
reaffirmed
the
jurisdictional
limits
which
have
until
then
been
exercised
by
the
board.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
exactly.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
we
all
submit
of
course
to
the
decision
of
the
courts.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
yes,
of
course.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
exactly,
and
i
--
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
nothing
--
nothing
has
happened
in
congress
legislatively
on
this
issue.
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
yes,
there
--
mr.
herman
e.
cooper
there
have
been
such
efforts.
they're
reflected
not
only
in
some
legislation
but
also
in
the
activities
of
the
maritime
administration.
if
i
may
continue,
the
question
of
retaliation
which
i
submit
is
not
very
real.
we
have
very
recently,
mexico
protested
because
we
wouldn't
permit
--
the
coast
guard
wouldn't
permit
one
of
its
crew
ships
to
sail.
there's
been
international
opposition
to
the
maritime
commission's
implementation
of
the
bonner
act
which
seeks
to
regulate
rate
making.
and
you
have
prime
minister
macmillan's
threat
the
efforts
of
the
maritime
commission
to
regulate
affairs
of
foreign
shippers.
the
--
this
kind
of
friction,
we
submit,
insofar
as
honduras
is
concerned,
is
within
the
control
of
united
fruit
because
united
fruit
could
decide
tomorrow
that
there
should
no
longer
be
a
single
vessel
under
empresa
and
that
decision
would
be
rapidly
implemented
and
become
a
fact.
united
fruit
could
decide
tomorrow
than
set
up
time
chartering,
it
would
bareboat
charter
and
this
whole
issue
would
disappear
so
far
as
empresa
is
concerned.
and
united
fruit
is
the
one
rather
than
the
honduran
government,
rather
than
empresa
which
in
fact
makes
the
decision
as
to
the
real
relationship
between
these
vessels
and
their
ownership.
now,
let's
examine
what
happens
if
board
jurisdiction
is
rejected.
i
think
this
is
a
necessary
subject
of
concern.
it
will
leave
the
union
no
other
recourse
but
self
help
which
we
would
approach
most
reluctantly.
this
in
effect
would
mean
economic
pressures
in
effect
that
it
would
neither
picketing
permitted
to
us
in
the
marine
cooks.
it
would
mean
that
in
--
of
other
cases,
we
would
be
thrust
before
a
variety
of
coastal
state
courts
and
then
we'd
have
to
fight
out
the
issue
after
each
time
a
vessel
was
stopped,
the
port
would
be
disturbed
that
a
strike
might
spread
in
all
of
its
complexities
as
these
industrial
disputes
have
a
habit
of
doing
and
at
the
same
time
there
could
be
no
real
resolution
of
the
underlying
question
and
that
is
the
activity
of
the
board
as
an
instrumentality
of
avoiding
this
kind
of
industrial
strike
on
the
waterfront.
and
this
is
not
the
kind
of
in
terrorem
argument
which
i
submit
is
characteristic
of
some
of
the
amicus
curiae
briefs
of
foreign
countries.
this
is
a
concrete
and
foreseeable
consequence
if
we
are
denied
access
to
the
orderly
processes
of
the
labor
board.
and
i
may
ask
with
all
due
respect,
how
would
a
rejection
of
board
jurisdiction
contribute
to
fulfilling
congressional
purpose
of
avoiding
through
the
machinery
set
up
by
the
act,
the
domestic
industrial
strife
and
the
rest,
the
burdening
and
obstructing
of
the
free
flow
of
commerce,
the
encouraging
of
collective
bargaining.
the
court
of
appeals
below
recognize
that
american
unions
like
the
national
maritime
union
have
a
vital
interest
in
labor
conditions
on
empresa
vessels
and
that
a
labor
dispute
between
our
union
or
any
union
and
these
vessels
would
disrupt
the
flow
of
commerce
to
and
from
this
nation
no
less
than
if
we
are
engaged
in
such
an
issue
with
an
american
ship.
there's
been
some
reference
made
to
congressional
intent
and
we
submit
that
it
clearly
upholds
board
jurisdiction.
and
in
this
relationship,
i
would
like
to
make
reference
to
one
point
not
raised
by
my
friend
of
the
board.
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
antitrust
statutes
which
have
been
hollowed
by
case
law
as
representing
authority
for
congress
to
exercise
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
and
appropriate
situation.
we
were
very
troubled
by
a
question
which
was
asked
as
to
legislative
history,
did
congress
intend
that
it
would
extend
the
arm
of
the
board
into
a
situation
of
this
character.
we
could
find
no
specific
legislative
history
because
this
statute
is
a
statute
of
general
inclusion
and
specific
exclusion.
and
the
other
statute
which
bears
the
closest
relationship
to
it
is
the
sherman
act
in
1890.
and
what
we
did
then
was
to
take
the
sherman
act,
the
language
of
the
sherman
act,
defining
commerce.
and
we
discovered
in
this
comparison
that
the
frameworks
of
the
labor
act
must
have
gone
to
the
sherman
act
for
the
definition
of
commerce.
because
if
you
follow
the
description
of
commerce
in
the
labor
act
and
the
one
contained
in
the
sherman
act
in
1890,
you
find
that
the
language
is
almost
identical
in
specific
particulars
so
that
when
the
reference
is
made
to
any
foreign
nation
or
any
foreign
country
that
the
inference
may
fairly
be
drawn
that
the
congressional
intent
when
it
framed
the
sherman
act
in
1890
and
obtained
extraterritorial
jurisdiction
through
it
or
gave
it
and
by
the
same
token,
the
utilization
of
the
same
if
not
identical
language
in
the
labor
act,
accomplished
the
same
purpose.
and
i
submit
that
under
u.s.c.
8
title
xv
and
if
i
may
take
a
moment
to
read
the
language
so
that
the
impression
of
it
is
left
clear.
the
language
is
contained
in
the
sherman
act
by
its
commerce
as
follows:
this
commerce
is
used
therein
means
trade
or
commerce
among
the
several
states
and
with
foreign
nations
or
between
the
district
of
columbia,
or
any
territory
of
the
united
states
and
any
state
territory
or
foreign
nation,
or
between
any
insular
possessions
or
other
places
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
or
between
any
such
possession
or
place
and
any
state
or
territory
of
the
united
states
or
the
district
of
columbia
or
any
foreign
nation
or
within
the
district
of
columbia
or
any
territory
or
any
insular
possession
or
other
place
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
it
makes
it
very
specific
when
you
compare
this
language
with
the
language
utilized
in
the
commerce
clause
of
the
labor
act
that
congress
might
well
have
intended
and
i
dare
not
to
say
must
have
but
may
well
have
intended
that
the
same
reach
granted
in
the
antitrust
statutes
were
to
be
utilized
and
the
statute
of
general
inclusion
and
specific
exclusion
because
under
the
labor
act
when
they
wanted
to
cut
something
out,
they
cut
it
out.
when
they
wanted
to
cut
out
agricultural
workers,
they
cut
it
out
specifically.
when
they
wanted
to
cut
out
domestics,
they
cut
them
out
specifically.
but
when
they
were
talking
about
the
reach
of
the
area
of
jurisdiction,
they
left
it
in
terms
of
foreign
commerce
precisely
as
the
language
itself
is
conveyed
by
the
language
in
the
sherman
act
itself.
i
would
like
to
conclude
on
one
note,
if
i
may.
we
--
i
argued
the
afran
case
which
this
court
referred
to
with
the
approval
in
marine
cooks
before,
judge
bryan
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
and
we
had
the
same
problem
there.
we
had
this
question,
does
the
liberian
treaty
superimposed
its
contents
over
the
activities
of
american
citizens
in
american
commerce.
and
this
engaged
judge
bryan's
attention
to
a
great
degree
because
it
had
to
do
with
not
the
extra
territorial
impact
of
united
states
law
on
liberia
but
the
extraterritorial
impact
of
liberian
law
through
a
treaty
on
the
united
states.
and
he
concluded
after
viewing
the
authorities
and
listening
to
the
argument
that
the
treaty
relied
on
in
that
case
as
the
treaty
relied
on
in
this
case
does
not
confer
upon
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
or
in
this
case
or
upon
their
vessels,
any
greater
rights
than
those
of
american
corporations
or
vessel.
it
goes
no
further
than
to
place
them
on
a
parody
with
american
corporations
and
vessels
in
the
respects
enumerated
in
the
treaty.
i
submit
that
all
references
that
may
have
been
made
to
the
impact
of
the
honduran
treaty
of
friendship
with
this
country
fall
into
the
same
category.
it
is
a
fact
that
while
we
owe
respect
and
comity
to
the
decisions,
to
the
laws
of
other
countries
they
owe
us
respect
too.
we
are
entitled
to
the
same
comity
which
they
expect
of
us.
and
when
we
are
talking
as
we
are
here
about
american
commerce
by
an
american
corporation
behind
the
façade
of
honduran
corporation,
are
we
not
justified
and
expected
that
american
law
will
be
upheld
notwithstanding
this
vague
and
we
call
it
threats
of
reprisal
which
are
intended
to
defeat
the
congressional
purpose.
