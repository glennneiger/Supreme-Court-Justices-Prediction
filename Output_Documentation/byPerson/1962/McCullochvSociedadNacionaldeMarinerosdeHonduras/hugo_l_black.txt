have
you
had
any
cases
--
does
the
board
have
any
cases
where
an
individual
does
the
same
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
line
with
your
argument,
what
would
be
the
difference
if
an
individual
owning
--
own
the
united
fruit
in
the
individuals
name
but
put
his
boats
under
foreign
flag.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
country
is
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
it
was
built
in
foreign
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
asking
you
whether
they
were
built
impart
with
the
subsidies
from
the
treasury.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
by
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
have
the
citation
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
the
law
to
which
you
referred
apply
also
to
subsidies
to
the
ship
building
company
as
well
as
to
the
shipowner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
on
what
you're
asking
now.
suppose
the
judgment
were
obtained
against
these
companies.
it
was
filed
by
the
union
that
there
would
be
no
argument
to
show
that
united
fruit
really
ought
to
pay
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
this
name
for
example
with
directly
pay
on
these
honduran-flag
vessel
sailing
under
the
american
flag.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
are
the
wage
rates
fixed
now?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
regulated
under
honduran
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
whole
honduras?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
no
legal
regulation.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no
legal
compulsion
for
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
bargaining
agreements.
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
the
union
or
the
government
attempt
to
get
congress
to
clarify
the
scope
of
the
labor
board's
jurisdiction
in
this
field?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
hasn't
yet
accepted.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
is
this
fight
been
going
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
mean
the
specific
one.
i
mean
all
of
these
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
had
been
no
effort
at
all
and
nobody
has
presented
to
congress
or
anything
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
often?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
change
in
whatever
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
hasn't
been
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
the
congress
didn't
leave
any
particular
thing
in
effect
on
these
so
far
as
its
knowledge.
justice
hugo
l.
black
except
just
the
language
of
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
no
step
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
question?
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
would
be
based
on
the
assumption
so
that
we
don't
have
to
consider
the
corporate
business
at
all
if
you
would
say
consider
the
same
thing,
an
individual
owned
the
united
fruit
and
have
this
relationship
with
honduras.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
you
would
want
to
say
but
there's
no
question
is
there
--
of
the
power
of
congress
to
regulate
in
this
way
if
they
get
attempted
to
do
so.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
part
of
that
treaty
do
you
think
based
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
speaking
of
your
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
found
it
on
page
30.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
the
last
sentence,
the
part
with
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
suppose
that
so
far
as
reliance
on
your
treaties
stand
alone,
the
last
(inaudible)
would
make
it
rather
difficult
because
it
says
that
the
local
laws
permits,
they
can
exercise
jurisdiction
over
each
--
it's
concerning
the
adjustment
of
wages
and
the
execution
of
contracts
relating
they
do.
i
would
think
it's
probably
that
we
can
draw
argument
on
your
treaty,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
constitutional
provision
do
they
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
that
--
i
don't
know
that
we
have
ever
reach
that
but
it's
been
held
that
the
commerce
power
of
nation
can
regulate
the
kind
of
goods
that
will
be
shipped
in
commerce
and
the
hours
that
which
people
work
in
the
states
or
matters
where
they
couldn't.
federal
government
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
now,
i
think
that
would
--
might
be
an
answer
to
your
argument
about
commerce
clause?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
recall
that
one
thing
which
(inaudible)
had
a
pretty
exhibitory
effect
on
the
act
of
congress
was
that
when
congress
wasn't
sure
with
committee
reports
with
respect
to
(inaudible)
this
kind
of
ship
and
(inaudible)
as
any
place
in
the
world
unless
they've
--
as
they
work
more
than
five
days
a
week.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
the
questions
i've
asked
have
no
relationship
whatever
to
your
main
argument
that
the
act
should
not
be
read
in
going
beyond
what
you
have
said.
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me,
did
you
say
page
16
and
17
of
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
number
91
and
3.
justice
hugo
l.
black
107.
thank
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
we
have
to
adopt
one
of
the
two
or
the
theory
in
order
to
determine
what
the
--
what's
the
scope
of
the
national
labor
relations
act?
