mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
has
filed
the
brief
amicus
and
obtained
--
believed
to
participate
in
the
oral
argument
in
this
case
because
the
executive
branch
is
convinced,
not
only
that
the
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
asserting
jurisdiction
over
these
vessels
is
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law.
but
more
important
that
because
we
are
convinced
after
careful
study
that
if
upheld,
the
decision
of
the
board
will
disturb
our
international
relations
and
prejudice
of
the
national
defense.
the
government
urges,
therefore,
that
the
decision
below
in
each
case
should
be
affirmed.
in
the
beginning,
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
to
draw
certain
distinctions.
much
of
the
argument
thus
far
has
dealt
with
all
foreign-flag
vessels
and
it's
been
a
considerable
effort
to
speak
of
the
panlibhon
fleet
as
if
these
were
all
vessels
which
have
the
same
characteristic
in
relation
to
this
country.
this
is
not
true
at
all.
one
important
distinction
is
between
apparently
all
honduran
vessels
and
a
large
number
of
liberian
and
panamanian
vessels.
the
13
vessels
involved
in
this
case,
whatever
may
be
our
jurisdiction
over
them
plainly
do
have
a
very
substantial
connection
with
honduras,
on
the
other
hand,
and
there
are
only
13
but
--
13
honduran
vessels
beneficially
owned
by
american
interest
so
that
apparently
there
is
no
case
of
the
use
of
the
honduran
flag
simply
as
a
flag
of
convenience
using
the
term
in
the
sense
of
a
flag
on
a
vessel
which
does
not
carry
the
trade
of
the
flag
nation
or
have
other
substantial
contacts
with
it.
i
found
it
convenient
in
my
analysis
of
the
problem
to
divide
the
universe
of
foreign-flag
vessels
which
are
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
necessarily
also
with
the
commerce
of
some
foreign
nation
into
four
categories
which
are
not
perfect
but
which
i
think
are
helpful.
but
first,
i
would
list
those
foreign
flag
vessels
whose
beneficial
ownership
is
foreign
and
which
are
substantially
engaged
in
carrying
the
trade
of
the
foreign
state.
the
most
obvious
example
is
of
course
the
queen
mary
and
the
other
cunard
liners
or
the
claims
of
boac.
everyone
would
agree
that
this
first
category
of
foreign-flag
vessels
is
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
even
though
it
is
plainly
engaged
in
the
foreign
commerce
of
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
clearly
within
the
literal
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
provision
of
the
statute
and
clearly
demonstrates
i
think
that
congress
did
not
undertake
to
show
where
the
board's
jurisdiction
was
to
break
off
in
this
respect.
in
the
second
category,
i
would
put
those
foreign
flag
vessels
whose
ultimate
beneficial
ownership
is
in
u.s.
interest
but
which
are
substantially
engaged
in
carrying
the
trade
of
the
flag
nation.
this
would
be
the
case
if
the
cunard
stock
was
held
by
citizens
or
other
domiciliaries
of
the
united
states.
it
is
the
present
case
because
all
13
of
these
vessels
are
engaged
in
carrying
the
trade
of
honduras.
they
serve
the
honduran
academy,
indeed
i
suspect
that
they
are
more
important
to
interest
located
in
honduras
and
to
the
honduran
economy
than
they
are
to
the
economy
of
the
united
states.
furthermore,
let
me
point
out
that
in
the
case
of
a
foreign-flag
vessel
which
carries
the
trade
of
the
nation
whose
flag
it
flies
but
there
may
often
be
as
and
then
dangerously
would
be
a
substantial
additional
contact
with
that
nation
but
the
present
case
is
again
an
illustration.
the
crew
of
these
vessels
is
a
honduran
crew,
indeed
it
required
to
be
honduran
by
a
honduran
law
and
it's
covered
by
a
honduran
collective
bargaining
contract.
the
employees
are
represented
by
honduran
union.
the
crew
signed
in
honduran
--
honduras
under
honduran
article
and
it
will
go
back
to
honduras
normally
at
the
end
of
each
voyage
then
they're
released.
the
vessels
are
managed
by
honduran
corporation
whether
one
pierce
of
the
corporate
friction
or
not,
the
fact
is
that
they
are
managed
by
an
office
in
honduras,
by
the
people
in
honduras
who
have
a
substantial
amount
of
discretion
particularly
in
relation
to
the
matter
that
we're
now
concerned
with,
labor
management
relations.
the
third
and
fourth
categories
have
to
do
in
my
judgment
with
vessels
who's
beneficial
--
with
vessels
which
are
not
substantially
engaged
in
carrying
the
trade
of
the
flag
nation.
and
i
distinguish
between
the
third
and
fourth
according
to
the
ownership.
in
the
third
category,
in
other
words,
i
would
put
those
foreign-flag
vessels
whose
ultimate
beneficial
ownership
is
thorough
but
which
are
not
engaged
in
carrying
the
trade
of
the
flag
nation.
the
incres
case
which
is
to
be
argued
following
these
n.l.r.b.
cases
is
a
good
example
of
this
category.
the
vessels
fly
the
liberian
flag
and
apparently
except
for
that
in
the
text
and
regulatory
consequences
have
no
other
contact
with
liberia.
on
the
other
hand,
they're
italian
owned,
italian
managed.
the
crew
and
home
base
are
all
italian.
the
only
connection
with
the
united
states
is
that
the
enterprise
is
commerce
between
the
united
states
and
west
indian
ports.
in
the
fourth
category,
i
would
put
those
foreign-flag
vessels
whose
ultimate
beneficial
ownership
is
in
u.s.
interest
which
are
operated
essentially
as
part
of
the
u.s.
enterprise
and
which
are
not
engaged
in
carrying
the
trade
of
the
flag
basically
or
perhaps
the
best
examples
are
the
ore
boats
carrying
bentonite
from
south
america
but
not
from
panama
or
liberia
under
whose
flag
they
register.
many
tankers
fall
in
this
category
and
some
iron
ore
boats,
other
boat
carrier
to
that
carrier.
this
fourth
group
should
be
carefully
distinguished,
of
course,
from
the
present
case
where
the
vessels
are
carrying
the
trade
of
the
flag
nation.
in
this
fourth
category,
we
must
earnestly
submit,
is
not
presently
before
the
court.
the
united
states
takes
no
position
in
this
case
because
the
issue
is
not
before
the
court
and
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
statutory
jurisdiction
over
foreign-flag
vessels
which
are
owned
and
operated
as
part
of
the
united
states
enterprise
and
which
are
not
engaged
to
a
substantial
extent
in
carrying
the
trade
of
the
flag
nation.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
do.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
think
that
this
is
a
case
where
it
is
very
important
to
adhere
to
the
normal
legal
principle
that
the
court
doesn't
decide
more
than
what's
before
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
this
is
--
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
will
simply
going
to
say
that
this
is
a
problem
on
which
there
are
diverse,
complicated
and
delicate
national
interests
and
we
have
concluded
that
it
would
be
in
the
national
interest
not
to
deal
with
that
at
the
present
time.
it
may
arise.
why
it
will
rise?
no
one
can
tell.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
today
--
there
are
today
411
vessels
in
the
whole
panlibhon
category.
13
of
those
today
and
when
i
say
today,
i
mean
as
of
september,
are
honduran
and
apparently
are
all
the
united
fruit
or
empresa
vessel.
mr.
archibald
cox
13
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
are
honduran
the
other
are
panamanian
or
liberian.
i
may
say
too
that
since
the
question
was
raised
that
as
of
september
of
the
411,
186
was
sold
by
the
maritime
commission
under
bond
that
they
would
come
back
to
the
united
states
in
the
event
of
an
emergency.
225
of
them
and
these
are
the
newer,
larger
and
from
the
standpoint
much
more
important
that
were
constructed
abroad.
none
of
them
were
constructed
with
the
aid
of
a
subsidy
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
now
that
statement
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
sir.
now
that
--
that
requires
--
that
statement
alone
is
a
little
bit
or
maybe
a
little
bit
misleading.
the
186
that
were
sold
by
the
maritime
commission
were
built
during
world
war
ii
and
were
later
sold
by
the
commission.
many
of
the
vessels
built
during
world
war
ii
were
of
course
built
with
federal
fund
but
this
was
later
sold
under
a
formula
set
forth
by
congress
in
the
statute.
but
the
present
subsidy
arrangement
do
not
and
cannot
apply
in
any
respect
to
vessels
that
are
not
to
be
registered
under
the
u.s.
flag
and
which
--
and
they
must
be
kept
under
the
u.s.
flag
for
substantially
their
useful
life.
mr.
archibald
cox
all
but
--
well,
i
was
about
to
say
all
the
13.
i
think
that's
probably
a
little
too
broad
a
statement.
the
--
i
suspect
that
much
the
largest
part
of
them
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
quite
true.
we
--
and
the
difference
i
think
essentially
is
this
that
mr.
manoli
argues
that
the
flag
a
vessel
applies
is
never
controlling
and
that
the
board
should
examine
all
the
contacts
between
the
vessel
and
the
united
states
in
order
to
determine
whether
she
is
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states.
our
position
is
that
the
flag
is
controlling
under
the
ancient
precepts
of
international
law
in
every
case
where
the
registry
of
the
flag
is
supported
by
some
substantial
connection
with
the
flag
nation
so
that
it's
not
a
pure
friction.
in
other
words,
in
cases
where
the
vessel
is
carrying
the
trade
of
the
flag
nation
and
that
there
is
no
need
to
determine
what
the
rule
would
be
in
a
case
where
the
flag
is
in
a
sense
only
a
form
and
the
connection
where
the
united
states
is
otherwise
predominant
and
i
just
don't
think
you
may
take
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
next
step.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
--
it
would
take
care
of
a
very
considerable
number
of
them.
it
would
not
take
care,
i
take
it,
of
the
liberian
or
panamanian
concern.
how
far
it
would
go
to
ease
the
concern
of
the
united
kingdom
or
canada,
i
have
straight
to
say
that
the
state
department
advices
me
that
the
foreign
relations
problems
would
be
reduced
if
our
position
were
sustained
here
regardless
of
what
might
happen
in
the
category
of
cases
i
would
say
you
should
not
decide.
now,
if
that's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
excuse
me.
i
just
want
to
make
this
one
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
defense
problem
curiously
is
far
more
concerned
with
the
question
that
i
say
is
not
here
because
it
is
the
big
boat
carriers
--
mr.
archibald
cox
this
--
no.
the
big
boat
carriers
are
at
present
time,
so
far
as
the
department
of
defense
is
concerned,
in
this
situation.
the
owners,
the
present
owners
have
assured
the
defense
department
that
they
would
be
made
available.
there
is
no
attached
bond
as
to
what
will
happen
to
the
ship
that
that
is
the
present
arrangement.
the
panamanian
and
liberian
governments
are
also
willing
that
they
should
be
made
available.
if
they
were
to
pass
into
the
registry
of
any
other
country
certainly
in
the
west
european
registry,
that
would
not
be
true
and
if
they
were
to
pass
as
a
result
of
economic
forces,
out
of
the
control
of
american
--
united
states
corporation
of
course
that
holding
would
be
gone.
and
since
a
very
large
pond
of
the
essential
defense
planning
is
based
on
the
availability
of
these
vessels.
anything
which
disturbed
their
present
condition
would
be
of
very
great
concern
from
the
standpoint
of
the
national
defense.
now,
of
course
this
is
an
argument
which
not
only
support
our
position
here
but
if
pressed
to
its
extreme,
it
would
require
us
to
say
what
we
do
not
now
say
and
that
is
that
the
flag
principle
should
be
applied
100%.
and
when
i
say
we
reserve
judgment,
i
mean
exactly
that,
i
cannot
say
what
our
position
would
be
if
that
other
case
were
here
because
there
are
diverse
problems,
the
problems
of
maritime
labor
relation,
there
are
problems
of
jobs,
there
are
arguments
back
and
forth.
the
argument
of
the
u.s.
jurisdiction
is
obviously
at
its
strongest
note
in
this
case.
and
it
was
this
difficulty
which
led
us
upon
reflection
to
think
that
this
was
truly
a
situation
where
the
old
rule
about
case
by
case
decision
was
wise
not
only
as
a
judicial
matter
but
wise
from
the
standpoint
of
the
national
interest.
mr.
archibald
cox
defense
and
the
labor
boards
are
completely
at
odds,
if
that
is
--
yes,
i
--
there
is
no
--
i
hesitate
to
go
by
in
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
so
far
as
the
executive
branch
is
concerned
but
the
defense
argument
would
certainly
be
completely
at
odds
with
the
labor
board.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
is
true,
and
yes,
and
i've
been
thinking
about
that.
i
do
not
want
to
go
quite
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
should
be
treated
as
utterly
irrelevant
in
the
case
but
i
would
be
making
the
same
argument
i
am
sure,
regardless
of
the
problem
of
corporate
ownership.
so
that
when
i
say
u.s
beneficially
owned,
i
am
in
effect
disregarding
the
corporate
ownership.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
have
not
concerned
ourselves
with
that
and
i
will
say
just
a
word
or
two
about
it
because
mr.
manoli's
time
was
short
but
really,
we
have
to
take
in
the
position
on
that
because
that
isn't
our
major
concern
in
this
case.
the
court
has
before
it
here
you
would
recall,
mr.
justice
brennan,
two
cases.
one
coming
from
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
a
suit
by
the
honduran
union
to
enjoin
this
election
and
the
other
was
the
suit
by
the
employer
in
new
york
to
enjoin
the
election.
now,
as
i
understand
the
board's
view,
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
have
it
right,
it
takes
the
position
that
an
employer
may
not
bring
an
action
to
enjoin
the
holding
of
an
election.
but
the
union
may
because
the
union
has
probably
no
other
way
than
not
so
good
equity
of
protecting
its
interest.
one
can
workout
as
a
professor
complicated
whether
they
might
strike
and
thereby
raise
the
issue
but
for
all
practical
purposes
they
have
not.
and
therefore,
the
board
would
concede,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
action
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
a
case
within
the
cognizance
of
equity
even
though
it
would
argue
the
action
in
new
york
was
not
now,
both
these
cases
were
pending
at
the
same
time
and
they
therefore
seem
to
the
board
and
to
me
in
consultation
to
the
board
that
it
was
not
desirable
to
bring
the
employer
issue
before
the
court
at
the
same
time
as
the
underlying
substantive
question
so
that
the
court
would
be
free
to
publicize.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
might
--
i
myself
have
expressed
in
writing
the
view
that
leedom
and
kyne
should
not
be
extended
in
dealing
with
the
elections.
that's
reprinted
in
the
clerk
and
based
in
the
books
on
administrative
law.
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
the
concern
of
congress
was
not
interfering
with
the
elections.
but
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
difference
in
the
concern
at
the
certification
stage.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
must
say
that
i
stepped
out
of
character
i'm
afraid
here.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
that
--
mr.
archibald
cox
you
mean
--
i
think
it
has
--
i
think
it
has
allowed
unions
to
bring
two
things,
yes.
and
of
course,
it
should
be
said
i
think
here
that
if
one
is
ever
to
allow
interference
with
the
conduct
of
an
election.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
this
--
assuming
that
the
board
is
wrong
on
the
merits
is
the
kind
of
situation
where
it
could
be
a
problem
because
the
mere
taking
of
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no
sir,
no.
i'm
stepping
back
into
character,
taking
no
position
with
respect
to
it.
now,
coming
to
the
merits,
one
must
begin,
as
mr.
manoli
began,
with
the
words
of
the
statute
itself.but
in
this
case,
the
words
of
the
statute
give
no
guidance
whatsoever
to
the
extent
of
national
labor
relations
board
jurisdictions
over
foreign-flag
vessels.
section
2
(6)
of
the
act
define
commerce
to
include
trade,
traffic,
commerce,
transportation
or
communication
between
any
foreign
country
and
any
state
or
territory.
sections
9
and
10
give
the
board
jurisdiction
over
any
question
of
representation
or
unfair
labor
practice
affecting
commerce.
there
is
no
greater
help
in
the
definitions
of
employer
and
employee
since
except
for
certain
specific
exclusions
or
inclusions,
i
simply
say
employer
includes
any
employer,
the
employee
includes
any
employee.
a
literal
application
of
the
definition
to
what
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested,
gives
the
board
jurisdiction
to
hold
election
among
the
crew
of
the
queen
mary
or
of
the
boac
overseas
airlines.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
airliner
would.
mr.
archibald
cox
you're
quite
right.
assuming
that
the
definitions
aren't
different
and
there
is
a
matter
of
exclusion.
obviously,
this
was
not
intended.
and
we
must
take
it,
i
think,
that
congress
in
the
original
wagner
act
left
a
literal
universality
of
the
language
to
be
confined
by
recognition
of
the
settled
principles
of
international
maritime
law.
i
should
say
too
that
no
additional
light
has
grown
on
the
problem
by
the
amendments
that
came
at
later
stages
of
the
act.
the
board
cites
section
14
(c)
(1)
which
was
enacted
in
1959
as
part
of
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act.
it
provides
that
the
board
shall
not
decline
to
assert
jurisdiction
over
any
labor
dispute
over
which
it
would
assert
jurisdiction
under
the
standards
prevailing
on
august
1,
1959.
we
think
this
provision
is
utterly
irrelevant
really
for
three
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
section
14
(c)
(1)
was
directed
to
an
administrative
practice
of
declining
to
exercise
and
acknowledge
statutory
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
that
the
matter
was
too
small
to
be
of
concern
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
it
was
not
concerned
and
congress
at
that
time
did
not
review
what
was
the
statutory
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
second,
section
14
(c)
(1)
speaks
of
the
standards
prevailing
on
august
1,
1959.
those
were
published,
announced
standards.
it
doesn't
refer,
i
think,
to
each
or
every
decision
that
the
board
might
have
handed
down
sometime
in
the
past.
and
finally,
one
can
review
the
legislative
history
of
the
1959
amendments
through
every
word
and
he
will
not
find
a
single
word
that
addresses
itself
with
this
problem.
in
the
absence
of
any
contrary
guidance
from
the
congress,
we
submit
that
the
case
is
governed
by
the
settled
principle
that
the
federal
statute
will
be
construed
to
recognize
the
need
for
comity
and
reciprocity
in
relation
to
international
maritime
commerce
and
to
avoid
conflict
with
international
use.
that
rule
is
old.
it
goes
back
at
least
to
the
words
of
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
in
the
charming
betsy
where
he
said
that
“an
act
of
congress
ought
never
to
be
construed
to
violate
the
law
of
nations
if
any
other
possible
construction
remains.”
the
rule
is
laid
down
in
a
number
of
cases
including
lauritzen
and
larsen.
most
pertinent
here
no
doubt
is
the
benz
case
in
353
u.s.
there,
an
effort
was
made
to
bring
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
a
labor
dispute
affecting
a
foreign
vessel,
foreign
registered
and
foreign
owned
vessel
in
a
port
of
the
united
states
engaged
of
course
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
because
she
was
beginning
to
load
grain
to
be
transported
to
one
of
the
west
coast
ports
to
a
foreign
nation.
in
the
benz
case,
the
court
rejected
this
effort
to
extend
the
national
labor
relations
act
saying,
for
us
to
run
interference
in
such
a
delicate
field
of
international
relation,
there
must
be
presently
affirmative
intention
of
congress
clearly
expressed.
it
alone
has
the
facilities
necessary
to
make
fairly
such
an
important
policy
decision
where
the
possibilities
of
international
discord
are
so
evident
and
retaliative
action
so
certain.
we
therefore
conclude
that
such
an
appeal
should
be
directed
to
commerce
--
to
congress
rather
than
to
the
court.
it's
unusually
important,
indeed,
i
think
it
is
essential
that
to
adhere
to
this
principle
in
applying
a
law
regulating
the
choice
of
a
collective
bargaining
representative
and
the
relations
between
employer
and
crew.
but
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
is
a
unit.
it's
an
integral
thing
and
only
one
nation
that
can
successfully
regulate
it.
in
this
respect,
the
current
problem
differs
remarkably
from
the
situation
with
respect
to
personal
interest.
there's
inconvenience
as
the
court
recognized
in
the
romero
case
in
having
the
law
applicable
to
compensation
for
personal
injuries
or
vary
with
the
port
in
which
the
injury
occurs
or
the
forum
in
which
the
suit
is
brought.
but
once
the
case
is
decided,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
it's
a
transient
thing
and
it
does
not
therefore
affect
as
here
an
ongoing
relationship.
now,
the
situation
with
respect
to
collective
bargaining,
the
choice
of
representatives
is
quite
difficult.
you
can't
have
one
bargaining
representative
in
honduras,
another
in
singapore,
another
in
london
and
another
in
new
york.
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
designed
to
be
a
continuing
thing
to
govern
the
relationships
of
the
parties
and
exclusively
to
govern
them
for
a
year
or
two
years
whatever
it
may
be
.you
can't
bring
men
under
one
contract
in
new
york
and
another
in
honduras.
decisions
about
the
bargaining
unit
have
a
continuing
effect.
once
the
decision
is
made
by
one
jurisdiction,
the
organizational
problems
within
that
company
will
never
be
quite
the
same
as
if
the
decision
had
not
been
made.
this
court
recognized
this
problem
of
representation
proceeding
in
its
earliest
cases
dealing
with
the
problem
of
federal
occupation
of
the
field.
the
bethlehem
steel
--
the
bethlehem
case
and
the
la
crosse
telephone
case,
both
decided
in
the
court,
clearly
recognize
that
it
would
be
intolerable
to
have
both
the
states
and
the
federal
government
handle
questions
of
representation
affecting
the
same
company.
now,
the
situation
would
be
far
more
intolerable
as
between
the
united
states
and
the
foreign
nation
because
the
likelihood
of
divergence
in
the
applicable
laws
is
much,
much
greater.
for
example,
in
the
present
case,
the
n.m.u.
could
not
be
certified
to
represent
--
under
honduran
law,
under
honduran
law,
it
may
not
represent
the
crew
of
this
vessel.
on
the
other
hand,
sociedad
cannot
lawfully
appear
on
the
honduran
law
at
least
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
that's
the
reason
i
take
it
that
it
didn't
take
part
in
those
proceedings.
the
provisions
with
respect
to
the
bargaining
unit
and
duties
in
collective
bargaining
are
bound
to
be
altogether
different.
for
example,
under
honduran
law
as
i
read
it,
there
is
no
right
to
exclusive
recognition,
whereas
of
course
our
law
gives
the
majority
the
right
to
exclusive
recognition
or
if
there
is
any
such
right,
it
is
quite
different
under
honduran
law
and
its
goal.
again,
you'll
find
that
under
honduran
law
that
the
regulation
and
limitations
on
the
right
to
strike
are
very
different
from
the
regulation
and
limitations
of
the
right
to
strike
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
conversely
the
guarantees
of
the
right
are
considerably
different.
as
it's
implicit
in
what
i
have
said,
there
is
a
very
considerable
body
of
honduran
law
regulating
on
the
relations
between
employer
and
crew
on
these
vessels.
some
of
it
is
direct
regulation,
other
parts
of
it
deal
with
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
employer
and
any
labor
union
chosen
by
the
honduran
employees.
those
laws
are
collected
in
the
lieu
brief
amicus
filed
by
the
republic
of
honduras.
this
brings
me
to
what
i
conceive
to
be
the
basic
fallacy
in
the
approach
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
it
takes
an
egocentric,
one
might
almost
say
a
chauvinistic
point
of
view,
and
repeatedly
asked
whether
the
vessels
are
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states.
of
course,
they're
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
the
united
states,
but
a
vessel
trading
between
the
united
states
and
a
foreign
nation
is
necessarily
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
the
foreign
nation
as
well
as
the
commerce
of
the
united
states
and
so
are
the
vessels
in
this
case
engaged
in
the
commerce
of
the
flagged
country
to
a
regular
and
substantial
degree
and
they're
obviously
important
to
that
country.
similarly,
the
n.l.r.b.
approach,
wholly
fails
to
resolve
the
problem
of
dual
regulation.
the
board
acknowledges
the
likelihood
of
some
conflict
between
the
duties
that
it
would
impose
and
the
duties
imposed
by
honduran
law
but
it
shrugs
them
off
in
the
briefs
saying,
“this
is
a
burden
which
the
shipowner
must
bear
as
a
consequence
of
doing
business
in
a
manner
which
subjects
into
the
laws
of
due
sovereignty.
well,
i
doubt
that
that
is
very
much
comfort
to
the
shipowner
caught
between
conflicting
laws
but
i'm
sure
that
it
is
an
utterly
inadequate
approach
as
a
matter
of
international
relation.
a
friendly
foreign
commerce
is
to
be
carried
on
overseas,
one
must
look
at
these
problems
from
a
detached
point
of
view
being
mindful
that
the
problems
of
interest
of
the
foreign
state
as
well
as
the
problems
and
interest
of
the
united
states.
it
is
essential
then,
we
think,
and
to
the
circumstances
of
this
case
and
indeed
in
dealing
with
labor
management
relations
generally
to
have
a
single
internationally
accepted
standard
for
determining
which
of
two
or
more
nations
with
an
interest
in
the
labor
management
relations
for
the
vessel
shall
have
jurisdiction
and
which
others
shall
stand
aside.
the
traditional
and
almost
universally
accepted
maritime
principle
is
that
the
law
of
the
flag
nation
will
be
allowed
to
govern
the
internal
affairs
of
the
vessel
such
as
labor
management
relations
and
the
relationships
between
the
vessel
or
the
master
and
her
crew.
that's
the
principle
unrecognized
in
international
law,
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
in
the
treaties
of
the
united
states
and
in
the
consular
regulations
issued
by
the
state
department,
the
references
are
voluminous
in
the
briefs
and
i
don't
stop
to
do
more
than
what's
referred
to.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
would
if
one
went
to
full
extent
of
saying
that
it
must
be
--
completely
wouldn't
and
mechanistic.
i
think
that
i
can
perhaps
best
to
put
it
this
way
that
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
are
very
powerful
reasons
such
as
i
have
indicated
and
others
that
i
will
try
to
outline,
they're
there
in
my
brief
for
holding
that
the
flag
is
determined.
but
as
this
withdrew
so
many
legal
problems,
there
are
interests
which
don't
logically
deny
those
but
which
are
entitled
to
be
taken
into
account.
now,
if
you
have
a
situation
where
there
are
other
interest
over
here
that
clash
with
the
logic
of
that
argument,
where
there
is
a
real
overwhelming
united
states
interest
and
where
the
flag
is
in
truth
nothing
but
a
picture
or
parts
of
certain
text
logically.
and
then
the
matter
of
disregarding
it
may
be
very
different,
there
may
be
reasons
in
that
limited
field.
it
may
have
consequences
in
international
relation
but
the
problem
may
be
quite
different
in
doing
it
on
the
broad
scale
that
the
board
proposes.
so
while
in
the
sense
by
argument,
the
thrust
of
it
goes
part
ways.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
doesn't
require
in
any
sense
taking
this
additional
step.
it
might
require
it
or
it
might
not
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
certainly
judge
friendly
did.
whether
judge
holtzoff
was
going
100%
or
not,
i
suppose
you
can't
tell
because
in
the
case
that
he
have
before
him,
there
were
these
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
fact
had
a
basis.
let
me
put
it
that
way.
it
was
validly
founded
in
the
fact
that
the
vessel
was
carrying
the
commerce
of
the
flag
nation
and
indeed
in
this
case,
it
had
another
foundation
too.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
of
course
most
of
mr.
cooper's
argument
was
that
the
corporate
separation
between
empresa
and
united
fruit
is
fiction.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
my
answer
as
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
is
that
even
if
it's
true,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
as
long
as
there
is
a
foundation
in
the
carrying
of
the
trade
of
honduras,
it
--
then
there
is
sufficient
basis
for
the
flag
and
the
flag
without
looking
further
should
be
regarded
as
conclusive.
i
don't
think
--
i
suppose
he
will
in
rebuttal
but
i
don't
think
mr.
cooper
really
said
that
there
was
no
attachment
between
these
vessels
of
honduras.
i
don't
see
how
it
could.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
even
if
they
are
an
american
company
may,
as
your
honor
pointed
out
earlier,
may
do
business
overseas.
mr.
archibald
cox
after
much
passing
of
note
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
we
all
concluded
that
we
didn't
know
but
we
all
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
sorry,
that's
quite
fairly
none
of
counsel's
specific,
the
tarried
answer
is
yes
because
there
are
some
vessels
which
are
owned
by
panamanian
corporation
registered
in
honduras
whether
that's
in
a
state
or
not.
there
are
not
involved
in
this
case
but
there
are
in
existence,
one
or
two
as
cited.
the
assertion
--
may
i
say
just
one
word
further
about
the
internal
order
doctrine.
it
seems
to
us
that
labor
management
relations
are
part
of
the
internal
order
governed
under
the
traditional
view
by
the
law
of
the
flag.
this
court
has
held
that
seamen's
wages
are
normally
governed
by
the
law
of
the
flag.
in
wildenhus'
case,
the
famous
passage
is
quoted
over
and
over
again,
the
court
referred
to
the
generally
accepted
rule
that
the
flag
nation
alone
should
govern
the
internal
discipline
of
the
ship
and
the
general
regulation
of
the
rights
and
duties
of
the
officers
and
crew
toward
the
vessel
or
among
themselves.
now,
of
course
if
one
thinks
where
should
the
underlying
distinction
be
drawn,
it
would
seem
to
put
quite
clearly
the
labor
management
relations
on
the
side
of
things
which
are
predominantly
of
the
concern
of
the
vessel.
they
don't
arise
out
of
the
vessels
relations
with
the
literal
state
or
with
the
people
of
its
port,
they
remain
constant
including
their
problems
remain
constant
as
she's
on
the
high
seas
or
regardless
of
the
port
she's
in.
and
also,
things
have
their
interaction
as
they
do
today
and
particularly
through
the
intervention
perhaps
of
their
port
union,
others
may
be
affected
but
still
the
core
of
this
is
something
that
concerns
the
vessel
or
owners
and
crew
and
goes
with
the
vessels
or
owner
or
crew
regardless
of
the
relationship
to
the
flag
nation.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
sir.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
assume
not.
i
assume
the
congress
has
the
power
that
--
yes.
it's
scarcely
necessary
for
me
to
mention
the
concern
which
the
foreign
state
has
exhibited
with
these
decisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
what
i
would
like
to
make
a
point
is
that
their
concern
has
not
been
confined
to
filing
briefs
in
this
court,
that
it
has
been
expressed
in
normal
diplomatic
interchange
over
a
number
of
years
and
that
the
officials
of
the
united
states
responsible
for
our
foreign
relation
hold
the
opinion
that
insistence
upon
the
application
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
these
vessels
would
have
deeply
disturbing
consequences
in
international
relation.
mr.
archibald
cox
chief
justice,
i
have
just
one
or
two
moments
remaining
and
i
would
like
to
take
them
with
the
court's
permission
to
indicate
how
the
incres
case
which
is
to
be
heard
after
these
n.
l.
r.
b.
cases
fits
in
to
our
scheme.
the
--
we've
not
asked
for
time
in
that
case
and
i
think
to
round
out
the
problem,
it
might
be
proper
to
say
just
a
word
or
two
about
it.
our
basic
proposition
as
i
indicated
before
lunch
is
that
the
flag
is
not
only
so
much
the
most
convenient
but
indeed
the
only
convenient
way
of
determining
which
nation
may
regulate
a
unitary
problem
of
labor
management
relations,
that
the
flag
should
be
regarded
as
decisive
where
it
has
some
solid
foundation
and
usually
in
the
fact
that
the
vessel
is
carrying
the
trade
of
the
flag
country.
now
the
incres
case
which
is
to
follow
this,
you
will
find
that
the
vessel
sails
under
the
liberian
flag
but
has
virtually
no
contact
with
liberia
and
specifically
carries
no
liberian
trade.
if
the
vessel
were
u.s.
owned
and
beneficially
operated,
if
it
were
operated
as
part
of
an
enterprise
based
on
the
united
states,
shall
i
say,
in
the
sense
that
the
aluminum
industry
is
based
on
the
united
states
or
the
parts
of
the
steel
industry.
then
we
would
have
the
question
which
the
government
does
not
reach.
but
in
the
incres
case,
the
vessel
is
not
beneficially
owned
or
managed
by
what
is
essentially
a
domestic
corporation.
the
vessel
is
italian
owned
and
operated
in
every
beneficial
sense
and
the
immediate
corporate
owner
is
a
liberian
corporation.
the
crew
and
articles
are
italian.
the
owner
of
the
new
york
agency
which
handles
the
bookings
for
these
cruises
is
italian.
the
home
port
of
the
vessel
is
italian
and
the
only
connection
with
this
country
really
is
that
it
carries
trade
out
of
new
york
to
the
caribbean
and
back
again.
so
that
even
if
it
be
said
that
the
flag
is
a
fiction,
in
our
view,
there
is
not
a
sufficient
u.s.
interest
in
this
case
to
attack
the
fiction
assuming
that
it
can
ever
be
attacked,
virtually,
everything
about
it
is
formed.
now
the
case
does
have
one
added
complication.
it's
been
held
that
a
state
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
deal
with
a
labor
management
relations
problem
where
it
is
arguably
dealt
with
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
in
the
case
involving
the
great
lakes
last
term,
the
court
said
that
this
rule
applied
where
the
question
was
whether
these
were
employees
and
this
was
a
labor
organization
arguably
within
the
meaning
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
we
think
those
cases
but
notwithstanding
those
cases,
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
erred
here
because
on
these
factual
reason.
this
fact,
it
is
not
even
arguable
we
think,
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
would
have
jurisdiction.
now
the
facts,
the
decisive
facts
in
our
view
are
all
known.
there's
no
problem
of
growing
inferences.
no
problem
of
weighing
or
balancing
or
occasion
for
the
use
of
expert
discretion.
second,
we
think
the
doctrine
of
arguably
subject
should
not
be
applied
in
this
area
where
the
question
is
one
of
the
statutory
jurisdiction
of
the
board,
vis-à-vis
the
claims
of
foreign
nations
because
this
is
a
matter
of
some
one
person
must
do
it.
you
can't
all
take
hold
of
it.
this
is
not
a
field
which
involves
the
interpretation
of
some
broad
term
contained
in
the
act
such
as
employee
or
labor
organization.
it's
a
matter
in
which
the
board
has
no
particular
expertise
and
we
would
think
therefore
that
it
is
not
cut
in
to
the
usual
doctrine
to
say
that
it
has
no
application
here.
we
conclude
therefore
that
to
disregard
the
registry
of
either
the
honduran
vessels
or
the
liberian
vessels
in
the
words
of
this
court,
does
not
fit
the
accommodations
that
become
relevant
in
fair
and
prudent
regard
for
the
interest
of
foreign
nations
in
relation
to
their
own
ships
and
their
own
nationals,
and
the
effect
upon
our
interest
of
our
treatment
of
the
legitimate
interest
of
foreign
nations.
mr.
archibald
cox
those
come
from
the
romero
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
same
direction
of
an
election.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
got
two
injunctions
out
against
the
same
election.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes,
i
think
that
if
the
case
were
decided
in
the
district
of
--
on
this
certiorari
to
review
the
decree
of
the
district
court
and
the
district
of
columbia,
the
other
one
in
the
sense,
i
take
it
would
become
moot.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
we
didn't
bring
the
question
here.
