mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
sociedad,
the
honduran
union
which
has
for
the
past
20
years
represented
the
crewmen,
the
unlicensed
crewmen
aboard
these
vessels
of
empresa.
there
are
335
of
these
unlicensed
crewmen.
all
of
them
are
honduran
citizens
except
one
who
is
a
jamaican.
i
believe
that
the
impact
of
the
board's
order
upon
sociedad
and
the
crewmen
that
it
represents
is
probably
more
drastic
than
on
any
other
party
before
this
court.
because
if
the
board
order
is
upheld
and
the
board
is
successful
in
enforcing
it
throughout
the
world,
it
means
literally
this
that
sociedad
will
go
out
of
existence
and
these
crewmen
will
lose
their
jobs.
because,
number
one,
sociedad
is
not
named
and
cannot
be
named
under
honduran
law
as
one
of
the
unions
for
which
these
crewmen
are
allowed
to
vote
under
the
board's
order
.number
two,
under
american
law,
if
full
american
jurisdiction
is
shoved
aboard
these
vessels
at
75%
of
the
master
crew
of
each
vessel
must
be
american
citizens
just
as
the
requirement
that
has
been
referred
to
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
brennan's
questions.
honduran
law
requires
90%
of
the
master
crew
to
be
honduran
citizens.
now,
i'm
glad
that
mr.
manoli
corrected
his
statement
that
our
contract
has
gone
out
of
existence
because
as
we
have
alleged
in
our
complaint
and
as
they
admit,
the
contract
is
in
existence
to
april
15,
1963
and
there's
a
provision
set
forth
on
page
21
of
the
record
which
provides
that
unless
either
party
gives
30
days
notice,
the
contract
is
renewed
automatically
for
another
two
years.
there
was
one
other
fact
that
was
said
here
by
someone
much
more
expert
than
i,
mr.
cooper,
about
wage
rates
in
this
field
when
he
said
that
the
honduran
wage
rate
were
about
one-fourth
those
of
american
seamen.
i
can't
believe
that
is
accurate.
i
have
merely
hearsay
information
but
if
you
look
at
pages
16
and
17
of
the
record
where
we
set
forth
the
wage
rates
of
these
honduran
seamen
in
american
dollars.
some
of
them
get
as
much
as
$210
a
month
and
i
doubt
seriously
that
we
have
many
crewmen
aboard
american
vessels
earning
$900
a
month.
so
with
those
statements
about
the
factual
situation,
i
would
merely
say
that
what
the
--
we
are
faced
with
here
is
the
replacement
aboard
these
honduran
vessels
of
the
very
complex,
the
very
modern
honduran
labor
code
which,
as
it's
been
pointed
out,
it's
attached
to
their
brief
of
honduras
here
which
is
in
many
ways
much
more
modern
as
the
solicitor
general
has
mentioned
some
of
the
things
in
our
own
law
with
the
complex
labor
law
of
the
united
states
of
america
through
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
yes.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
no.
it's
in
107,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
if
you
look
at
page
15
and
16
of
the
record
you'll
see
the
wage
rates
set
forth
there
that
are
required
to
be
paid
under
this
contract
in
american
dollars.
now,
he
really
believed
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
frankly
whether
or
not
this
treaty
that
has
been
referred
to
for
the
international
law
shall
govern
or
whether
or
not
the
national
labor
relations
act
should
govern.
and
in
approaching
an
answer
to
that
question,
we
feel
that
very
important
that
we
stress
the
regulatory
scheme
that
exist
now
throughout
the
whole
world
for
this
flag
state
sovereignty
that's
existed
for
many
centuries.
it
is
to
prevent
turmoil
and
conflict.
its
contained
rules
of
practical
necessity
which
mr.
marden
says,
even
our
enemies
adhere
to.
now
that
is
what
the
board
would
tear
down
because
what
it
says
is
that
instead
of
honduras
having
the
exclusive
power
and
control
over
honduran
flag
vessels
throughout
the
world,
the
national
labor
relations
act
would
replace
that
regulation
whereas
under
international
law
today,
honduras
has
the
full
physical
power
and
control
over
every
vessel
that
flies
its
flag.
now,
this
juridical
order
that
exist
on
the
high
seas
today
is
key
to
the
flag
and
the
flag
isn't
just
an
empty
gesture
because
with
the
flag,
goes
many
duties
and
responsibilities
in
addition
to
the
taxes
and
other
things
that
were
referred
to
here
that
the
country
might
get.
for
example,
this
board
order
would,
we
feel,
prevent
honduras
from
carrying
out
these
duties
and
responsibilities
that
go
with
the
flag.
one
illustration
of
how
important
the
flag
is,
is
that
it's
only
the
flag
nation
which
can
order
ships
around
for
its
own
national
interest.
a
good
illustration
is
the
order
issued
by
the
president
of
honduras
telling
all
honduras'
vessels
long
before
this
quarantine
to
stay
out
of
cuba.
that
is
the
power
of
the
flag
and
it's
universally
recognized
and
followed.
and
i
think
we
have
to
also
keep
in
mind
in
connection
with
this
problem
that
all
international
law
rules
are
really
two-way
streets.
everything
that
we
can
do
to
honduras
here
and
honduran
crewmen
as
--
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
marden,
they
can
do
to
us
and
i
think
one
other
fact
that
i
should
call
to
the
court's
attention
is
set
forth
in
the
brief
of
the
republic
of
honduras
here
and
that
is
its
entire
merchant
fleet
consists
of
22
vessels.
the
13
vessels
here
are
therefore
more
than
one-half
its
entire
merchant
fleet.
so
the
impact
on
the
republic
of
honduras
is
not
inconsiderable.
so
this
regulatory
scheme
that
exist
now
and
what
we
would
tear
down
if
the
national
labor
relations
board
order
is
allowed
to
go
into
effect,
is
one
that
is
not
only
universally
adhered
to
but
--
and
workable
but
it
comes
into
conflict
with
this
election
order
rather
quickly
because
the
conduct
of
this
election
in
foreign
ports,
ports
of
honduras
or
any
other
place
where
these
ships
might
be
by
a
mail
or
anything
else
is
a
flagrant
violation
of
honduran
authority
under
international
law.
and
the
honduran
government
has
filed
its
protest
here.
you'll
find
in
the
record
the
very
concisely
stated
protest
of
the
ambassador.
he
protested
through
the
diplomatic
channels
which
are
referred
to
by
the
solicitor
general.
but
we
have
not
only
the
problem
of
clash
of
sovereignties
on
the
open
seas
and
imports
throughout
the
whole
world.
for
example,
if
this
board
order
is
upheld
and
some
of
these
ships
go
into
the
harbor
in
london,
who
will
the
london
authorities
look
to,
the
united
states
of
america
or
honduras?
they
fly
in
with
a
honduran
flag
yet
you
have
this
labor
relations
act
that
might
have
something
to
do
with
some
instance
that
might
occur
there.
because
the
nations
of
the
world
look
to
the
flag
state,
if
a
ship
cuts
an
international
cable
or
anything
like
that,
the
protest
always
go
to
the
flag
state.
so
this
flag
is
not
an
empty
gesture.
the
country
that
grants
the
use
of
its
flag
accepts
rather
grave
and
important
responsibilities.
now
there's
been
a
reference
here
to
comity.
i
think
that
while
it's
true
that
within
the
territorial
waters
of
the
united
states,
we
have
under
this
comity
practice
never
interfered
in
the
internal
management
affairs
of
vessels
flying
foreign
flags
that
this
treaty
that
is
referred
to
which
recognizes
our
flag
and
the
flag
of
honduras
is
conclusive
within
the
territorial
waters
of
each
nation
really
makes
the
international
law
rule
that
applies
on
the
open
seas,
applied
within
the
territorial
waters
of
each
nation
so
it
makes
this
rule
universal.
and
i
think
it's
rather
interesting
that
while
so
many
nations
throughout
the
whole
world
have
adopted
new
labor
code
within
the
last
15,
20,
or
30
years,
not
a
single
nation
has
ever
before
asserted
that
its
labor
relations
act
applies
on
board
a
foreign
flag
vessel
in
its
own
territorial
waters,
although
it
applies
that
labor
code
to
its
own
ships
within
it's
own
territorial
waters
very
naturally.
so
--
and
certain
it
is
that
no
court
has
ever
upheld
any
such
assertion
because
other
than
in
canada,
it's
probably
the
only
place
that
has
even
been
raised.
now,
we
come
to
the
national
labor
relations
act.
a
lot
has
been
set
about
it,
but
i
wanted
to
stress
just
one
point.
and
that
is
from
the
days
of
chief
justice
marshall,
that
has
been
referred
to
until
now.
there's
been
a
universal,
uniform
rule
that
unless
there
is
an
expressly
--
expressed
intention
to
apply
a
domestic
statute
of
general
terms
internationally,
it
will
not
be
so
applied
as
mr.
justice
clark
said
in
benz,
it
requires
an
affirmative
intent
clearly
expressed.
now
congress
legislated
here
undoubtedly
with
that
in
mind,
and
there's
a
quotation
in
the
brief
of
empresa
over
on
page
24
and
25
from
a
decision
by
chief
justice
marshall
in
the
exchange
--
schooner
case
where
he
said
that
to
apply
one
of
these
domestic
statutes
internationally
would
be
a
breach
of
faith
with
the
--
our
nation
throughout
the
civilized
world.
well,
i
think
it
would
almost
be
a
breach
of
faith
with
congress
in
having
acted
on
one
rule,
a
rule
that
has
been
universally
enunciated
and
adhered
to
by
this
court
to
how
it
changed
now
under
these
circumstances
because
it
undoubted
--
it
relied
upon
that
rule
in
treating
the
very
statute
that's
before
this
court
now.
and
i
come
then
to
the
so-called
contacts
theory.
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
uses
the
term
interest
and
the
board
uses
the
term
contacts,
and
they
both
defined
it
differently.
and
i
would
agree
empathetically
with
what
mr.
marden
have
said
that
the
law
of
the
flag
should
govern
because
the
contacts
theory
is
not
a
rule
of
law
that
we
can
establish
internationally
at
least
but
unilaterally.
as
i've
said
before
the
--
a
rule
of
international
law
is
a
two-way
street.
and
this
contacts
theory
disturbs
also
because
what
we're
saying
in
effect
that
we'll
add
up
the
contacts
and
that
we
think
the
contacts
are
great
enough,
will
nullify
international
law.
now
such
a
self-assessing,
self-determination
of
our
own
self-interest
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
abide
by
rules
of
international
law,
i
submit,
is
a
rather
shocking
thing.
this
self-judging
disturbs
greatly
because
we
have
another
instance
in
international
law
where
we
have
self-judging
involved,
that
we
have
the
so-called
county
reservation.
we
decide
whether
or
not
in
our
own
self-interest,
we're
going
to
let
a
case
be
decided
by
the
world
court.
now
if
we're
going
to
say
that
in
our
self-interest,
every
time
that
we
add
up
the
contacts
with
the
united
states
of
america
or
in
some
certain
way
that
judging
those
facts
ourselves,
we
are
going
to
--
either
let
international
law
apply
or
not.
we
will
in
effect
have
injected
another
type
of
self-judging
reservation
for
which
there
certainly
is
no
precedent
in
law
or
experience
to
tear
down
and
wipe
out
this
international
law
rule
which
is
so
universally
adhered
to
throughout
the
whole
world.
and
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
would
say
that
i
do
not
quite
understand
that
he
places
the
entire
emphasis
upon
it.
it's
true
that
my
distinguished
adversaries
and
others
have
referred
to
it
as
a
contacts
decision.
i
would
say
that
if
it
is
so
interpreted,
i
believe
that
it's
based
on
a
wrong
principle.
i
agree
with
mr.
marden
that
the
law
of
the
flag
should
govern
here
and
not
some
new
theory
based
upon
rather
nebulous
criteria
with
the
board
stating
one
group
of
criteria
and
the
solicitor
general
stating
still
another
and
then
the
board
coming
before
this
court
and
saying
to
you,
“we
disagree
with
the
way
that
judge
friendly
added
up
the
contacts.
we
think
he
was
wrong”.
it
means
just
this
to
a
small
union
like
the
one
i
represent
would
be
here
once
under
the
law
of
the
flag
will
be
here
many
times
under
the
contacts
theory.
it
just
comes
down
to
that
practical
application.
now
the
--
mr.
charles
s.
rhyne
mr.
justice
black,
i
think
that
you
can
interpret
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
not
reaching
foreign
flag
crewmen
and
that
ends
the
case,
in
other
words,
reaffirm
benz.
so,
one
thing
that
really
--
that
serves
me
about
the
fourth
category
of
the
solicitor
general
is
this.
he
doesn't
explain
what
is
going
to
happen
about
the
dual
sovereignty
under
those
circumstances.
he
does
a
very
effective
job
in
his
argument
in
his
brief
in
saying
that
you
just
can't
have
two
jurisdictions
or
two
government
exercising
jurisdiction
on
a
single
vessel.
but
yet,
he
seems
to
leave
this
open,
this
dual
sovereignty
thing
which
he
really
can't
answer,
i
agree
with
him
in
that
fourth
category
which
i
feel
really
is
not
much
different
from
the
other
categories.
now
a
lot
has
been
said
here
about
the
fact
that
the
vital
interests
of
the
united
states
require
this
or
require
that.
it
seems
to
me
and
i
agree
with
mr.
manoli,
you
ought
to
tell
the
board
whether
they
stay
in
or
stay
out
because
look
at
the
tremendous
interest
of
these
foreign
governments
as
shown
not
only
by
the
briefs
filed
here
but
by
the
protest
which
the
solicitor
general
mentioned
that
come
through
diplomatic
channels.
literally,
the
eyes
of
the
seafaring
nations
of
the
world
are
upon
this
court,
are
you
going
to
abide
by
the
law
of
flag
state
sovereignty?
are
you
going
to
break
it
down?
are
you
going
to
try
to
state
a
new
exception
to
the
rule
of
flag
state
sovereignty?
and
i
urge
very
strenuously
upon
the
court
that
the
real
united
states
interest
here
is
not
entirely
in
the
commercial
field.
the
real
united
states
interest
in
this
case,
i
submit,
is
building
up
not
tearing
down
international
law.
and
i
think
that
this
can
lead
to
just
one
conclusion
and
that
would
be
a
reaffirmance
of
the
law
of
flag
state
sovereignty.
and
so,
i
urge
that
the
court
in
affirming
--
affirm
on
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
decision
of
judge
holtzoff
and
reaffirm
the
rule
that
this
court
has
said
so
many
times
of
flag
state
sovereignty
and
help
to
build
up
and
maintain
this
system
of
world
law
that
we're
all
working
for.
it
hasn't
been
very
long
time
less
than
two
years
when
i
sat
across
here,
a
couple
of
blocks
and
i've
heard
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
a
very
dramatic
and
noble
address
say
that
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
united
states
of
america
is
a
new
world
of
law
where
the
strong
or
just
and
the
weak
secured
and
the
peace
preserved
forever.
it
seems
that
this
court
has
a
rare
opportunity
to
--
in
this
case,
in
reaffirming
the
law
of
flag
state
sovereignty
to
say
to
the
whole
world
that
we're
interested
in
building
up
not
tearing
down
rules
of
international
law
to
which
the
nations
of
the
whole
world
and
ourselves
up
to
now
have
been
affirmatively
and
completely
committed.
and
so
we
ask
that
the
decision
of
the
district
court
be
reaffirmed.
