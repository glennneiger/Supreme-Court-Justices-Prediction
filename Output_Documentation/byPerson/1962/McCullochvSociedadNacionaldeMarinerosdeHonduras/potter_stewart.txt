these
ships
have
a
regular
run
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
invariably,
do
they
come
to
united
states
ports
on
every
voyage?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
quite
understand,
assert
jurisdiction
over
these
vessels?
the
board
--
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
justice
potter
stewart
then,
this
is
on
a
vessel-by-vessel?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
registration
involved,
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
you
don't
know
why
--
what
there
is
about
the
registration
laws
or
regulations
of
these
three
specific
nations
that
seem
to
have
attracted
--
to
them
so
much,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
--
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
--
so
far
as
the
second
aspect
goes,
there
are
a
good
many
other
countries
which
have
this
lower,
lower
level
of
wages.
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean,
all
through
that
--
a
matter
all
over
--
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
--
now,
you're
talking
now
about
the
american
investment
in
the
--
and
shipping
which
sails
under
the
flag
of
these
three
nations.
i
suppose
the
american
investment
in
other
--
in
those
countries
in
other
ways,
would
be
quite
a
higher
percentage,
wouldn't
it?
we
all
know
that
the
firestone
company
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
liberia,
the
united
fruit.
in
honduras,
it's
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
various
american
investments
in
panama.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
comparison
made
between
investments
in
non-shipping
in
those
com
--
countries
as
compared
to
shipping
investments
here?
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
are
high
figures,
but
i
just
wondered
--
that
you've
given
us.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
i
wondered
how
they
compare
with
the
investments
generally
by
americans
in
those
three
countries.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
this
is
a
tremendous
--
a
competitively
recent
development,
that
is
--
it's
a
tremendous
development.
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
recent.
justice
potter
stewart
since
world
war
ii
or
even
more
recently?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
not
unheard
of
before.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
but
literary
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
literary,
the
statute
would
go
much
further
than
you
are
now
contending.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
could
be
employees
of
united
fruit
who
were
down
on
honduras
and
never
left
honduras
and
there
would
be
--
you
wouldn't
assert
it.
justice
potter
stewart
so
--
so
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
employment
relationship
does
not
avoid
the
--
what
you're
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
urging
now.
justice
potter
stewart
--
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
benz,
the
ship
was
owned
by
panamanian
corporation
and
flying
--
and
registered
in
liberia
apparently.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
benz
case.
justice
potter
stewart
we
(inaudible)
with
the
norris-laguardia
act.
justice
potter
stewart
does
empresa
do
anything
else
but
own
and
operate
ships?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
does
it
do
anything
else
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
engage
in
the
shipping
business.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
would
arguably
be
within
the
literal
provision.
but
essential
--
justice
potter
stewart
literal.
justice
potter
stewart
you
would
not
only
take
no
position
but
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
urged
the
court
to
take
no
position
of
the
fact,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
do
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
--
justice
potter
stewart
go
ahead,
i
didn't
(voice
overlap).
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
guess
that
would
be
covered
by
the
railway
labor
act,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
argument
as
well
as
the
other
arguments
that
you
both
have
an
urging
would
--
if
adopted,
would
lead
to
a
decision
of
your
fourth
category
of
ships,
wouldn't
it,
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
if
a
--
would
then
if
you
will,
a
mechanistic
application
of
the
law
of
the
flag
doctrine,
the
so-called
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
has
been
referred
to
as
an
outmoded
doctrine
on
the
other
side
would
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
would
decide
your
fourth
category,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
who
are
these
defendants?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
you
can
say
it's
a
fiction
by
calling
it
a
fiction.
you
can
call
anything,
anything
and
mr.
cooper
says
that
in
this
case,
it's
a
fictional
situation.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
united
fruit
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
i
understood
him
to
say
was
--
were
--
these
were
united
fruit
vessels.
justice
potter
stewart
could
united
fruit
vessels
register
under
the
honduran
flag?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
makes
united
fruit
--
justice
potter
stewart
it's
neither
questions
but
i
didn't
know.
justice
potter
stewart
where
were
those
words
spoken?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
understand
judge
friendly's
opinion
in
the
second
circuit
to
have
--
been
based
upon
this
contacts
or
interest,
contacts
primarily
or
not?
