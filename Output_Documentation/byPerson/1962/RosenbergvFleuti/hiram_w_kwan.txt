mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
counsel
for
the
government
has
in
effect
stated
his
position
to
the
effect
that
an
alien
that
is
lawfully
present
in
the
united
states,
after
having
been
admitted
as
a
lawful
permanent
resident
is
not
entitled
to
due
process
of
law
or
not
entitled
to
notice.
we
disagree
with
that
position.
we
feel
that
the
statutes
as
promulgated
by
congress,
namely,
section
212
and
--
which
is
the
exclusion
section
and
section
241
are
mutually
exclusive.
section
212
sets
forth
the
basis
of
exclusion.
one
theory
could
be
that
an
alien
that
is
outside
of
the
united
states
prior
to
entry
would
not
be
entitled
to
know
notice
whatsoever.
i
think
the
law
is
in
that
direction.
however,
the
entire
section
212
is
incorporated
by
reference
into
the
deportation
statute
as
subsection
(a).
in
your
deportation
section,
i
think
that
the
alien
is
entitled
to
notice
because
he
is
physically
present
in
the
united
states.
if
that
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
under
the
exclusion
section
and
i
will
label
the
exclusion
section
1182
of
the
u.s.c.a.,
section
1182
u.s.c.a.
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
--
section
212.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
no.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes.
i
say
that
as
far
as
the
exclusion
is
concerned
where
you
have
the
alien
outside
of
the
united
states,
section
212
would
apply
and
he
may
not
be
entitled
to
notice
in
that
instance.
however,
whether
the
deportation
action
as
in
this
case,
the
controlling
section
is
241
or
title
8
united
states
court
annotated,
section
1251.
in
section
1251
(a)
(1),
the
--
any
alien
in
the
united
states
shall
upon
order
of
the
attorney
general,
be
deported
who,
subsection
(1)
at
the
time
of
entry,
was
it
--
within
one
or
more
of
the
classes
of
aliens
excludable
by
the
law
existing
at
the
time
of
such
entry.
so
it
incorporates
the
exclusion
statute
by
reference.
i
think
that
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
i
would
say
the
case
law
requires
notice
and
the
alien
being
in
the
united
states,
i
think
would
be
entitled
to
due
process
of
law
and
thus
be
given
notice.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
notice
of
the
charges
against
him.
the
grounds
of
deportation
but
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
say
again?
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
i
don't
think
that
he
was
given
notice
in
this
particular
case
if
we
hope
that
psycho
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
no.
i
don't
raise
any
question
of
irregularity
there.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes.
in
other
words
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
--
notice
of
the
statute,
the
basis
of
the
deportation
acts.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes,
that
is
my
point.
i
say
that
the
alien
in
the
united
states,
physically
present
within
united
states,
is
in
a
different
position
than
the
alien
outside
of
the
united
states.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes
sir.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes.
that
is
my
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
that's
correct.
if
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
that
is
the
basis
of
my
argument.
furthermore,
an
alien
outside
of
the
united
states
has
no
cause
of
action.
an
alien
of
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
an
incorporation
of
all
of
212
which
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
--
which
consists,
including
212
(a)
(4)
which
consist
of
33
different
subsections,
33
different
basis
of
excludability
into
section
12
--
1251
u.s.c.a
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
--
(a)
(1)
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes,
i
would
still
argue
that
the
term
psycho
--
psychopathic
personality
is
void
as
being
vague.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
well,
i'm
trying
to
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
i
would
say
if
congress
spelled
it
out
so
that
the
statute
was
clear
on
its
face
so
that
men
of
common
intelligence
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
can
determine
that.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
no,
that
would
not
satisfy
you.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes.
i
think
that
the
government
is
misapplying
section
212
(a),
namely,
the
exclusion
statute
in
this
particular
case
because
the
case
is
labeled
as
a
deportation
case,
that
the
respondent
was
physically
present
here
in
the
united
states.
he
was
lawfully
admitted
so
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
no,
something
more
--
whatever
would
be
sufficient
to
give
him
due
notice.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
i
think
sexual
deviant
would
be
too
broad
a
term.
certainly,
the
government
has
in
its
own
brief
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
i
think
i
would.
however,
a
setting
out
with
specificity
is
not
required,
of
course.
however
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes
sir.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
i
think
the
case
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
i
think
the
cases
are
uniform
in
that
regard.
they
may
not
be
--
an
alien
in
the
united
states
may
not
be
entitled
to
substantive
due
process,
but
i
believe
the
cases
are
uniform
in
granting
him
procedural
due
process.
i
notice
as
such
would
be
procedural
due
process.
i
think
it's
very,
very
important
in
this
particular
area
because
you're
dealing
with
the
most
important
right,
that
the
right
of
remaining
here
in
united
states,
your
deportation
amounts
to
banishment
and
--
and
then
in
this
particular
area,
you
have
perhaps
five
million
aliens
in
united
states,
and
most
of
the
aliens
are
handicapped
and
that
they
have
a
lesser
foundation
in
english
than
a
person
that
was
reared
here
or
that
has
been
here
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes,
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
cases,
the
bridges
versus
wixon
case.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes.
i
would
say
that
substantially
all
the
cases
that
have
held
on
that
point
have
said
that
the
--
a
lawful
permanent
resident
was
entitled
to
procedural
due
process.
kwong
hai
chew,
344
u.s.
holds
that,
fong
haw
tan
specifically
held
that,
that
was
in
333
u.s.
i
think
that
--
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
that's
correct.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
oh,
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth,
yes.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes
and
the
kwong
hai
chew
is
the
late
case
in
that
respect.
i
say
that
this
section
in
reference
to
psychopathic
personality
is
void
for
vagueness
because
it
is
uniformly
been
so
held.
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
of
that
particular
section
indicates
that.
prior
to
that
time,
the
section
was
constitutional
psychopathic
personality.
i
suppose
constitutional
meant
something
that
was
born
as
compared
to
an
environmental
influence,
but
the
authorities
especially
on
medical
authorities
are
greatly
at
variance
as
to
this
term
of
psychopathic
personality.
our
expert
indicated
that
the
respondent
was
not
a
person
within
that
area.
i
think
that
the
government
expert
would
have
probably
held
independent
of
his
instructions
to
the
same
effect,
that
he
was
not
a
psychopathic
personality.
your
experts
does
vary
in
the
case
of
u.s.
versus
flores
cited
in
both
briefs.
judge
frank
discussed
that
in
the
concurring
opinion,
however,
that
case
involved
a
perjury
conviction.
i
think
that
the
statute
should
be
held
unconstitutional
because
there's
no
particular
standard
with
which
that
--
men
of
common
intelligence
can
be
guided
that
is
set
up
in
this
bigger
statute.
government
counsel
would
have
the
court
incorporate
the
legislative
history
into
the
section
to
give
it.
i
don't
think
that
would
be
a
good
rule
because
in
my
--
in
my
view,
the
statute
should
be
complete
by
itself,
and
if
there's
some
interpretation,
some
slight
interpretation,
then
perhaps
the
legislative
history
should
be
looked
but
not
to
have
say
detail
as
far
as
the
statute
is
concerned
and
the
entire
body
of
the
section
in
legislative
history.
as
far
as
the
entry
is
concerned,
i
think
that
the
law
is
rather
clear
on
the
fact
that
a
reentry
carries
with
it
the
same
type
of
prejudices
or
the
same
type
of
legal
effect
that
a
new
entry
would
have.
i
would
like
to
see
that
changed.
certainly,
once
an
alien
comes
to
united
states,
he
--
he
gets
roots
here
and
there
are
substantial
rights
that
should
be
protected.
mr.
hiram
w.
kwan
yes,
i
think
so.
if
the
entry
is
a
voluntary
one,
then
the
alien
exposes
himself
to
a
greater
risk.
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
opinion
said,
however,
that
the
second
entry
did
not
serve
to
wipe
out
or
wash
out
his
rights
of
due
process
as
counsel
for
the
government
seems
to
indicate.
thank
you.
