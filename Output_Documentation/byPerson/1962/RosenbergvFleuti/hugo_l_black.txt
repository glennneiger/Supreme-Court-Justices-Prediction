justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
you
had
not
–
excuse
me?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i'd
--
i
had
thought
you
said
at
one
time,
it
was
--
the
law
didn't
forbid
this
or
didn't
make
this
a
disqualification
at
the
time
of
entrance?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
so
far
as
the
doctrine's
vagueness
is
concerned,
as
related
to
disqualifications
from
entering
that
it
could
be
written
in
ancient
sensory
or
anything
else,
immaterial,
whether
the
person
knows
it
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
would
suppose
that
what
you're
saying
is
that
alien
came
in
here
and
have
been
here
50
years.
congress
passed
a
law
and
said
50
years
ago,
we
should
have
passed
the
law
making
them
illegal
to
come
in
but
we
didn't.
but
we
do
now
and
he
has
to
be
deported.
your
argument
is
that'll
be
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
hadn't
been
that
long.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
say
it
was
this
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
but
the
question
i
asked
you,
which
you
answered
--
assume
that
you
didn't
need
to
go
any
further
than
to
say,
“well
congress,
anytime
they
sees
it
fit
and
that's
the
law
and
it
would
be
fine
retroactively.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
50
years
just
as
well
as
[inaudible],
i
would
think.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you're
--
you're
trying
to
--
you're
trying
to
put
a
thought
in
another
ground.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
if
that's
what
you're
relying
on,
i
agree
with
those
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
who
asked
the
questions.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that's
enough
if
you're
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
your
judgment
that
congress
has
as
much
power
to
deport
as
it
does
to
exclude?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
--
that
would
be
the
equivalent
of
it,
wouldn't
it,
making
it
the
same,
you
can
deport
--
you
can
deport
for
any
reason,
you
could
keep
him
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
have
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
you
have
ample
statements
on
which
you
base
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
reading
from
one
of
the
brief.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
he's
entitled
to
due
process
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
the
case
is
upheld?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
he
is
--
deporting
him,
the
statute
must
be
not
be
so
vague
that
it
would
be
held
bad
under
the
due
process
clause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
that
--
although
that
might
not
be
true
so
far
as
admitting
him
into
the
country.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
basis
of
your
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
would
have
a
hard
time
getting
away
from
that.
as
i
understand
what
you're
arguing
is
this
that
is
just
the
same
as
though
they
had
said
here
that
he
could
be
deported
if
he
was
a
psychopathic
personality.
and
you
say
that
congress
having
said
that,
that's
too
vague
to
give
him
knowledge
--
i
wonder
if
--
deport
him
for
being
--
engaging
in
the
conduct
he
has.
therefore,
it
violates
due
process
just
the
same
as
the
illustration
i
gave
as
it's
been
written
in
ancient
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
claim
a
that
he'd
be
again
in
and
come
for
a
country
as
a
man,
as
a
man
admitted
that
he's
entitled
to
due
process
of
law
under
our
cases
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
would
violate
the
due
process
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
case
do
you
rely
on
for
your
second
prong
of
your
argument,
he
being
here
in
this
country
and
living
as
a
resident
alien
he's
entitled
to
due
process
the
same
as
anybody
else
procedurally
speaking.
have
you
any
case
on
which
you
rely
to
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
bridges?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
first
--
that
was
held
way
back
in
yick
wo
versus
hopkins,
wasn't
it?
