mr.
philip
r.
monahan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
review
a
judgment
of
that
court,
setting
aside
a
deportation
order
on
the
ground
that
section
212
(a)
(4)
of
the
1952
immigration
and
nationality
act
as
applied
in
this
case
is
void
for
vagueness.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
the
respondent
is
a
50-year-old
native
and
citizen
of
switzerland.
he
is
unmarried
and
has
no
children
or
dependents.
he
was
admitted
for
permanent
residence
to
this
country
in
october
of
1952
and
has
resided
here
continuously
since
then
with
the
exception
of
a
period
of
something
less
--
something
less
than
a
day
when
he
made
a
trip
to
ensenada,
mexico
in
august
1956
following
which
he
was
readmitted
to
the
country
at
san
ysidro,
california
as
a
returning
resident
alien.
in
april,
1959,
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
issued
an
order
requiring
him
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
deported
as
an
alien
who
prior
to
entry,
and
the
entry
in
question
was
the
reentry
of
august
1956
which
i
might
say
parenthetically
at
this
point
constituted
an
entry
within
the
explicit
definition
of
entry
in
the
1952
act,
why
he
was
not
deportable
as
an
alien
who
prior
to
entry
was
convicted
of
an
offense
involving
moral
turpitude,
consisting
of
his
conviction
on
his
plea
of
guilty
in
the
california
superior
court
for
the
county
of
los
angeles
of
a
homosexual
act
committed
in
february
of
1956
for
which
he
was
sentenced
to
a
fine
of
$200.
the
respondent
appeared
at
the
immigration
--
at
the
deportation
hearing
with
counsel
acknowledged
the
truth
of
the
factual
allegations
underlying
the
order
to
show
cause,
conceded
his
deportability,
indicated
that
he
desired
to
be
deported
to
switzerland
and
was
ordered
deported.
he
indicated
that
he
did
not
desire
to
take
any
appeal
and
he
did
not
appeal.
however,
in
july
of
that
year,
on
the
motion
of
the
prosecuting
officer
of
the
service,
the
proceeding
was
reopened
on
the
representation
of
the
service
that
because
of
certain
technical
escape
clause
in
the
act
which
i
--
which
is
explained
in
our
brief
and
which
i
will
not
attempt
to
explain
here,
the
offense
underlying
the
outstanding
deportation
order
was
not
one
that
was
deportable
in
itself
because
it
came
within
the
definition
of
a
mis
--
a
misdemeanor
classifiable
as
a
petty
offense
as
defined
in
the
immigration
laws
and
therefore
in
itself
was
not
deportable.
however,
the
immigration
service
requested
that
the
proceeding
be
reopened
for
the
introduction
of
an
additional
charge
of
deportability
which
is
the
one
presently
before
the
court.
that
charge
was
that
he
was
in
it
--
he
was
deportable
because
he
was
inadmissible
at
the
time
of
his
august
1956
entry
as
an
alien
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality.
in
support
of
the
additional
charge,
there
was
received
in
evidence,
a
certificate
by
a
physician
of
the
united
states
public
health
service
certifying
that
the
respondent
was
a
psychopathic
personality
and
had
been
such
at
the
time
of
his
entry.
dr.
dahlgren,
the
public
health
service
physician
who
signed
the
certificate
was
--
testified
at
the
hearing
and
was
subjected
to
cross-examination,
and
he
testified
that
--
he
acknowledged
that
he
was
not
a
psychiatrist
himself
but
that
he
had
classified
the
respondent
as
a
person
afflicted
with
psychopathic
personality
because
the
official
instruction
book
of
the
public
health
service
called
the
manual
for
the
examination
--
medical
examination
of
aliens,
requires
that
any
alien
who
is
a
homosexual
or
sexual
deviant,
be
placed
in
the
category
of
a
psychopathic
personality.
he
stated
on
cross-examination
that
he
had
no
particular
opinion
or
no
particular
feeling
or
words
to
that
effect
as
to
whether
the
respondent
would
be
considered
a
psychopathic
personality
under
traditional
medical
standards.
in
addition,
the
record
of
a
second
conviction
of
the
respondent,
one
which
preceded
in
time,
the
one
i've
mentioned
before,
it
took
place
in
1953
which
was
also
based
upon
a
homosexual
act
as
the
respondent
admitted
at
the
hearing
was
received
in
evidence
for
which
--
and
the
record
shows
that
the
defendant
or
the
respondent
rather
was
sentenced
to
a
$100
fine
on
that
occasion.
it
was
also
received
in
evidence
a
sworn
statement,
a
sworn
statement
by
the
respondent
which
appears
at
pages
74
to
75
of
the
record
which
the
respondent
made
to
an
investigator
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
march,
i
believe,
of
1959,
and
which
he
acknowledged
at
the
deportation
hearing
was
true,
in
which
the
respondent
stated
that
he
had
had
homosexual
urgence
since
he
was
a
young
man
of
24
in
switzerland
and
that
in
the
intervening
period
of
22
years,
he
had
indulged
in
homosexual
activities
whenever
the
opportunity
presented
itself
which
he
said
was
on
the
average
of
about
once
a
month.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
this
was
a
voluntary
statement
made
to
him
to
a
--
an
investigator
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
it
was
made
in
march
of
1959
during
the
course
of
the
service's
inquiry
into
the
man's
background,
your
honor.
he
further
stated
in
this
affidavit
that
his
homosexual
activities
had
begun
in
switzerland
and
that
he
had
never
been
caught
or
arrested
in
switzerland
that
they
had
continued
in
this
country
and
that
he
was
unfortunate
enough
to
be
arrested
for
them
in
a
public
park
in
los
angeles.
he
acknowledged
that
both
his
1953
and
1956
convictions
were
based
upon
homosexual
acts.
he
stated
that
he
was
arrested
on
a
third
occasion
in
oxnard,
california
in
1958
for
similar
activities
but
those
charges
were
dismissed.
and
he
stated
that
since
his
second
los
angeles
arrest
or
conviction
rather
in
1956,
he
had
been
very
careful
with
respect
to
his
homosexual
activities
because
he
had
heard
that
such
things
were
reported
to
washington
and
he
felt
that
the
immigration
authorities
might
be
looking
for
him.
on
the
respondent's
behalf,
there
was
received
in
evidence
a
report
in
the
form
of
a
letter
to
the
respondent's
then
counsel,
predecessor
of
present
counsel,
i
believe,
by
his
personal
psychiatrist,
dr.
david
harvey,
in
which
dr.
harvey
stated
that
he
had
--
had
examined
the
respondent
on
four
occasions
between
may
and
august
of
1959,
and
it
acknowledged
that
the
respondent
had
had
homosexual
activities
since
the
age
of
26.
but
in
which
he
stated
that
the
man's
sexual
drive
particularly
at
his
age,
is
thought
to
be
within
his
range
of
control
especially
if
he
is
under
the
supervision
of
continuing
contact
with
a
psychiatrist.
and
in
which
he
further
stated
that
his
socioeconomic
relations
were
consistently
good,
that
he
did
not
frequent
homosexual
hangouts,
had
no
evident
interest
in
nudes,
manifested
no
irresponsible
trends,
and
had
his
main
social
contacts
with
respected
members
of
the
community.
dr.
harvey
further
stated
that
the
respondent's
deviation,
to
use
his
word,
was
not
sufficient
in
his
opinion
to
warrant
the
classification
psychopathic
personality,
and
that
the
formal
label
should
be
or
would
be
sexual
deviation,
homosexuality
now
under
control.
the
special
inquiry
officer
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
determined
that
the
addition
--
the
additional
charge
had
been
supported
because
on
the
undisputed
evidence,
the
respondent
was
and
at
entry
had
been
a
homosexual.
and
he
referred
to
a
prior
decision
of
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
in
which
the
board,
on
the
basis
of
a
thorough
analysis
of
the
legislative
history
of
section
212
(a)
(4)
of
the
1952
act
had
concluded
that
congress
--
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
homosexuals
and
sexual
deviants
within
that
category.
the
petitioner,
following
an
unsuccessful
appeal
or
rather
the
respondent
following
an
unsuccessful
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals,
sued
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
in
the
north
--
in
the
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
california
in
which
he
challenged
the
sufficiency
of
the
service's
finding
of
psychopathic
personality
and
in
addition
contended
that
the
term
was
unconstitutionally
vague
as
it
had
been
applied
in
his
case.
the
district
court
finding
that
--
that
there
was
certainly
ample
evidence
to
support
the
finding
that
he
was
and
in
entry
had
been
homosexual
held
that
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history,
it
was
clear
that
he
was
also
a
psychopathic
personality
within
the
congressional
intent.
the
court
rejected
the
contention
that
the
term
‘psychopathic
personality'
was
unconstitutionally
vague
with
the
observation
that
while
it
might
be
true
that
a
criminal
statute
which
employed
such
a
term
might
be
too
definite
to
be
sustainable,
too
indefinite
to
be
sustainable,
the
same
strict
standard
of
definiteness
should
not
be
required
of
a
statute
which
merely
defines
the
classes
of
aliens
who
are
inadmissible
to
the
country.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
phrase
was
unconstitutionally
vague
as
herein
applied
and
that
resort
might
not
be
had
to
the
legislative
history.
the
court,
while
recognizing
that
the
respondent's
deportation
had
not
been
ordered
on
the
basis
of
his
miss
of
--
of
any
conduct
in
this
country,
but
because
of
a
disqualifying
condition
at
the
time
of
his
entry,
held
nevertheless
that
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service's
reliance
in
part
in
making
its
finding
as
to
the
existence
of
that
condition
on
behavior
by
the
respondent
in
his
country,
made
the
application
of
section
212
(a)
(4)
to
his
case
fundamentally
unfair.
the
court's
rationale
is
set
forth
in
--
on
page
96
of
the
record
where
the
court
said,
“insofar
as
the
record
reveals
continuance
of
homosexual
practices
after
fleuti
entered
this
country
in
1952
and
again
in
1956
was
not
compulsive,
but
was
a
matter
of
choice.”
it
follows
that
if
by
reason
of
vagueness,
the
statute
failed
to
advise
him
that
homosexual
practices
conclusively
evidenced
a
psychopathic
personality,
fleuti
was
substantially
prejudiced.
as
in
the
case
of
a
vague
criminal
statute,
he
would
thereby
be
deprived
of
notice
that
unless
he
refrained
from
such
conduct,
harsh
results
might
follow.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
is,
sir.
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
the
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
is
true
that
it
is
acknowledged
on
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
respondent
was
a
homosexual
at
the
time
of
both
entries.
the
first
entry
may
not
be
regarded
because
that
occurred
before
the
effective
date
of
the
1952
act.
it
occurred
after
the
--
after
the
passage
of
the
act,
but
before
its
effective
date.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
you
have
to
rely
upon
the
second
entry.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh
no,
sir.
no,
it's
a
matter
of
what
congress
did.
certainly,
congress
could
make
homosexual
conduct
in
the
past
deportable,
but
it
did
not
--
has
not
done
so.
now,
to
get
back
to
your
question,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
is
true
that
there
has
been
ack
--
acknowledgment
of
his
homosexuality
at
the
time
of
the
pertinent
entry
in
august,
1956
and
we
do
say
that
it's
rather
unrealistic
to
assume
the
possibility
that
the
special
inquiry
officer,
while
he
did
consider
the
homosexual
activities
in
this
country,
would
have
reached
any
other
conclusion
even
if
he
had
ignored
those
activities
on
the
basis
of
the
respondent's
own
acknowledgment
and
his
own
psychiatrist's
statement
to
that
effect.
nevertheless,
the
court
of
appeals
did
think
that
because
the
service
had
considered
the
activities
in
this
country,
homosexual
activities
in
this
country,
in
part,
in
arriving
at
its
determination
that
at
least
we
do
not
rest,
we
do
not
rest
upon
the
acknowledgment
by
the
respondent
of
his
homosexual
condition
in
1956.
now,
we
submit
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
probably
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
probably
never
would
have
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
probably
never
would
have
come
to
light
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
had
he
not
acted
in
the
manner
that
he
did
in
this
country,
and
i
think
that
that
is
at
the
basis
of
what
bothered
the
court
of
appeals
about
this.
the
fact
that
his
preentry
activities
in
switzerland
probably
never
would've
come
to
light
and
there
never
would've
been
any
deportation
proceeding
had
he
--
had
it
not
been
for
his
homosexual
activities
including
his
convictions
in
this
country.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
is
--
that's
precisely
the
point
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
submit
that
the
court
has
misapplied
the
vague
--
the
void
for
vagueness
doctrine.
that
rule
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
is
--
that
is
correct,
sir.
yes.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
said
that
so
far
as
it
appears,
the
conduct
was
not
compulsive.
it
was
a
matter
of
choice
and
so
far
as
the
record
appears
that
is
true.
there
is
no
indication
that
these
were
compulsive
actions.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
not,
sir.
i
think
there'd
be
no
question
then.
but
it
is
true
that
he
--
he
did
take
into
consideration
the
convictions
and
activities,
the
admission
of
his
activities
in
this
country.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
he
perhaps
would
but
then
he
would
have
to
say
that
--
that
an
alien
who
is
knocking
at
our
doors
has
a
right
to
know
on
the
face
of
the
--
of
an
exclusion
statute,
on
the
face
of
it,
not
as
a
matter
of
legislative
history
but
on
the
face
of
it
that
a
person,
a
homosexual
is
included
within
the
category
of
psychopathic
personality
and
he
--
and
he
might
make
that
argument.
i
do
not
think
he'd
be
successful
because
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
--
that
is
the
step
that
has
been
taken.
he
did
get
into
the
country.
he
has
been
here
10
years
and
his
position
and
the
court
of
appeals'
position
is
as
a
result
of
his
residence
in
this
country,
he
has
acquired
the
right
to
challenge
the
exclusion,
the
admissibility
statute
for
lack
of
precision
on
its
face.
now
the
--
the
fair
--
the
void
for
vagueness
statute
--
doctrine
which
has
been
sometimes
referred
to
as
a
fair
warning
statute
has
always
been
applied
in
a
case
involving
behavior
governing
statutes.
the
point
is
that
as
the
court
has
said
in
the
--
one
of
the
leading
cases,
connolly
against
the
general
construction
company,
a
statute
which
either
forbids
or
requires
the
doing
of
an
act
in
terms
so
vague
that
man
of
common
intelligence
must
guess
at
its
meaning
and
differ
as
to
its
application
violates
the
first
essential
of
due
process
of
law.
and
as
this
court
said
more
recently
and
perhaps
more
succinctly
in
the
harris
case,
no
person
should
be
held
criminally
responsible
for
conduct
which
he
could
not
reasonably
understand
to
be
proscribed,
but
that
rule,
the
government
contends,
has
no
application
in
this
case.
for
here,
the
statutory
ground
on
which
the
respondent
was
ordered
deported
was
not
misconduct
after
an
entry,
but
a
condition
with
which
he
was
unfortunate
enough
to
be
afflicted
at
the
time
of
his
entry.
certainly,
congress
has
it
within
its
power
to
enumerate
physical
and
mental
defects
or
disorders
which
will
disqualify
an
alien
for
entry
and
it
has
done
so,
section
212
(a)
as
in
large
part,
a
catalog
of
such
disqualifying
conditions.
these
can
in
no
sense,
be
considered
as
guides
to
conduct
and
the
application
to
them
of
the
principle
requiring
indefiniteness
in
behavior
governing
statutes
and
have
no
rational
justification,
we
submit.
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
extend
in
a
wholly
unprecedented
manner,
the
fair
warning
doctrine,
and
has
converted
it
into
a
rule
which
protects
--
which
would
protect
resident
aliens
from
inadvertently
furnishing
evidence
to
the
immigration
officials
showing
them
to
have
been
afflicted
with
a
disqualifying
condition
at
the
time
of
their
entry.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
where
--
where
deportability
is
based
upon
inadmissibility
or
excludability
at
the
time
of
entry,
the
sole
question
in
a
deportation
proceeding
is
whether
or
not
at
that
time,
he
was
excludable.
so,
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question
is
yes.
that's
--
that
is
in
accordance
with
the
explicit
terms
of
the
immigration
law.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
white's
question
was
whether
or
not
congress
could
deport
an
alien
on
the
basis
of
past
homosexual
conduct
as
such.
and
i
said,
“no,
that's
a
--
congress
certainly
could
but
it
had
not
done
so
in
those
terms,
homosexual
conduct.”
it
has
used
the
term
‘psychopathic
personality'
and
it
is
necessary
to
go
to
the
legislative
history
of
that
phrase
in
order
to
discover
the
congressional
intent
to
include
homosexuals
within
that
category.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
this
--
it
was
prior
to
the
1952
act,
four
years
prior
to
the
entry
in
question
here.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
at
least
that
question
is
not
in
this
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
because
he
--
he
is
contending
that
he
has
a
right
as
a
resident
alien
not
to
be
deported
on
the
ground
of
past
excludability.
i
think
that
if
--
i
think
that
the
respondent's
contention
in
the
court
of
appeals
holding
hinges
upon
the
fact
that
he
has
been
a
resident
in
this
country.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
we
would
--
i
think
that
the
government
would,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
it
is
a
principal
of
constitutional
law
that
an
alien
who
has
never
reached
our
shores
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
at
what?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
that
would
be
true
as
long
as
the
legislative
history
were
clear
as
to
what
congress
intended.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
but
that
is
not
this
case
though.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
making
homosexuality?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
committed
before
entry?
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
oh,
yes,
yes,
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no
--
none,
sir.
not
under
the
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
--
i
think
so,
yes.
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
i
think
--
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
i
think
so,
yes
sir.
but
it
--
but
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
rely
upon
that
to
prevail
in
this
case.
that
--
that
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
i
want
to
rely
on
both.
i
want
to
rely
upon
that
point
as
well
as
our
other
points.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
before
his
--
the
entry
in
question,
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
well,
it's
just
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that's
not
just
my
suggestion,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no.
i'm
suggesting
that's
the
law
as
laid
down
by
this
court,
in
repeated
decisions,
that
congress
does
have
it
within
its
power.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
we
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
we
don't
rely
upon
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
we
don't
rely
upon
that
wholly
but
we're
--
that
was
one
over
the
strings
to
our
vote.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it
is
not
a
--
it
is
not
--
is
unappealing
as
that
case.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
is
true,
but
there
is
a
vast
body
of
psychiatric
literature
which
does
include
homosexuality
as
a
type
of
psychopathic
personality.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
that
if
--
no
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
no,
i
think
that
it
is
just
not
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
term
psychopathic
personality
in
the
absence
of
legislative
history
shows
any
congressional
intent.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
it's
a
--
yes
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
the
public
health
service
in
its
representa
--
in
its
representations
to
congress
and
what
they
say
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
acknowledged
that
the
term
psychopathic
personality
was
a
vague
one.
but
that
they
said
it
was
broad
enough
to
include
homosexuality
and
it
was
on
the
basis
of
that
representation
that
congress
struck
from
the
original
bills
which
eventuated
in
the
1952
act
the
explicit
reference
to
homosexuality.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
many
decisions
of
this
court,
mr.
justice
black
which
has
said
that
the
power
of
congress
with
respect
to
exclusion
and
deportation
is
plenary
which
i
understand
means
complete,
and
that
the
actual
decisions
of
this
court
indicate
that
the
court
means
just
that.
certainly,
the
power
to
deport
a
person
for
activities
which
were
not
ex
--
not
a
basis
for
deportation
when
they
occurred
--
in
other
words,
the
retroactive
making
of
activities
deportable
is
about
as
far
as
one
could
go
in
--
in
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
yes,
sir.
and
that
--
and
that
is
not
my
own
suggestion,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
that
is
the
law
of
--
as
laid
down
by
this
court
--
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
--
within
recent
terms.
mr.
philip
r.
monahan
thank
you.
