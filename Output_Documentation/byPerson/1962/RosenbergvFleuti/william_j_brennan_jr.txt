if

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
not
by
congress.
this
is
arguing
that
the
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
one
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
in
looking
at

[inaudible]
would
know
generally
[inaudible],
they
might
be
deported
[inaudible]
by
whatever
the
law
was
existing
at
the
time
of
the
entry
but
he
doesn't
[inaudible]
what
the
law
was,
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
let
me
ask
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
suppose
instead
of
[inaudible]
you
would
still
argue
the
same
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
seem
to
[inaudible].
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
wouldn't
satisfy
you
if
congress
had
--
had
spelled
them
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
do
you
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was
cited
33
subsection.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
get
right
back
to
the
alleged
vagueness
of
the
psychopathic
personality
in
212
(a)
(4).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
what
you're
saying
is,
it
would
be
alright
just
to
say
psychopathic
personality
for
purposes
of
admission
but
for
purposes
of
a
deportation,
it
would
have
to
meet
psychopathic
personality
including
homosexuality.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
--
what
would
satisfy
you
--
assure
that
the
classification
of
homosexuality
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
if
it's
too
vague.
