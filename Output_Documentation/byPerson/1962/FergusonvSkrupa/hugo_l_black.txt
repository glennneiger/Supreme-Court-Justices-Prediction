justice

black
what
was
the
legislature,
what
would
you
say
is
the
heart
of
the
act,
what
were
they
again
--
and
what
did
they
decide
shouldn't
go
on
--
and
you
would
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
debt
adjusting?
justice
hugo
l.
black
kind
of
a
private
adjustment
of
the
debts,
composition
of
debts,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
have
a
court
procedure
for
that
in
your
state
for
marshaling
of
debts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
written
on
the
bankruptcy
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show
who
is
responsible,
what
group
is
responsible
for
the
passage
of
the
law
and
to
the
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
somebody
was
against
it,
what
is
in
particular
--
what
are
the
group
does
it
hit?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
are
they
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
are
they
against
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it
made
it
easier
to
do
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what's
provision
of
the
constitution
was
it
held
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
ground
and
it's
unreasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
we
have
that
â€“
our
question
basically
is
whether
it
violates
federal
constitution
law
to
be
passed,
which
the
court
thinks
is
unreasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
cite
olsen
versus
nebraska,
did
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
didn't
cite
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
cited
in
some
of
those
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
about
olsen?
justice
hugo
l.
black
adams
versus
tanner?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
i'd
be
sure
that,
i
want
to
be
sure,
as
to
what
you
are
arguing.
as
i
understand
your
argument,
when
the
state
decides
that
it
didn't
want
at
the
particular
kind
of
business
activity
to
go
on
within
its
boundaries,
legislature
passes
the
law
and
the
governor
signs
it
that
we
have
a
right,
if
we
think
it's
unreasonable
to
set
it
aside
and
say
we
did
it
under
the
guise
of
due
process
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
not
your
argument?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
charging
that
it
violates
any
specific
provision
of
the
constitution
except
due
process?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
one
are
you
charging
due
process
or
equal
protection?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
because,
as
i
understand
you
want
us
to
return
to
what
we
said
we
were
leaving
in
the
northwestern
case
that
nebraska's
[inaudible]
you
want
us
to
leave
the
principle
we
said
there,
if
we
wouldn't
any
longer
strike
down
statutes
regulating
business
on
the
ground
that
the
court
felt
they
were
unreasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
wait
a
minute.
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
it
makes
it
unlawful?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
state
decides
in
usa,
a
state
decides
deliberately
through
its
legislative
body
a
certain
type
of
activity
like
this,
it
wants
to
prohibit
and
bar,
it
cannot
do
it
if
a
majority
of
this
court
decides
that
it's
unreasonable
but
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
just
want
to
be
sure
that's
what
we
have
to
--
that's
what
we
have
to
meet.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
the
state
of
--
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
is
held
it
by
the
kansas
constitution
that's
an
adequate
state
ground?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
was
the
vote
on
this
bill
in
senate
and
legislature?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
are
asking
us
to
hold
that
your
legislature,
state
senate,
governor
who
signed
the
bill
has
done
something
so
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
against
the
people
of
the
state
that
we
all
override
their
judgment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
said
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
can't
understand
if
this
violates
the
kansas
constitution,
why
you
didn't
bring
your
suit
in
the
state
court
and
charged
this
violation
to
the
extent
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that
you
are
--
whatever
we
decide
if
it
violates
the
kansas
constitution,
the
kansas
court
is
still
open
to
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
we
can't
pass
on
whether
it
violates
your
state
constitution,
that's
for
your
state
to
decide.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
it
was
that
clear,
if
it
was
that
clear,
after
you
read
northwestern
and
all
of
these
other
cases,
you
like
to
come
in
here
why
we
have
said
all
of
this
argument
has
been
undermined,
that
our
supervising
state
legislation,
if
it
is
that
clear
i
cannot
yet
understand
why
you
didn't
go
into
the
court,
when
it's
so
clear
that
even
a
child
could
read
it
and
see
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
violates
the
--
that's
a
violation
of
the
federal
statute
of
the
constitution
not
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
state
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
passed
on
that,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
but
they
didn't
say
it
violates
the
state
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
said
it
violates
the
federal
constitution.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
the
northwestern
case
was
up
here,
millions
of
people
in
this
country
believed
it's
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
to
pass
what
was
called
a
right
to
work
and
some
called
it
right
to
[inaudible],
they
give
it
different
labels.
and
they
ask
us
to
hold
it
was
unreasonable,
we
declined
to
do
so
and
said
the
time
has
passed
when
we
are
going
to
strike
down
state
statutes
regulating
business
on
the
ground
that
we
think
they
are
unreasonable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
label.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
constitution
was
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
provision
says
that
this
court
shall
have
the
right
to
invalidate
all
state
legislations
that
it
labels
as
arbitrary
or
capricious
or
unreasonable?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
construction
which
was
refused
to
be
followed
in
both
olsen
and
northwestern.
