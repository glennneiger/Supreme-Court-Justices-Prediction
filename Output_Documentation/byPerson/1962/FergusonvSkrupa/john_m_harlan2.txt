how
many
states
have
got
this
statute
on
their
books?
justice

that's
the
basic
vice
in
it?
justice

what
is
the
basic
vice
in
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
assuming
it's
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
confused
about
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case,
maybe
you
are
going
to
come
to
it,
but
as
i
read
its
opinion
the
--
what
it
said
in
effect
was
that
if
the
kansas
legislature
had
said
nobody
can
do
any
debt
adjusting
except
the
lawyer,
that
might
have
been
all
right.
but
what
they
seem
to
be
bothered
about
is
the
way
they
read
the
act,
kansas
has
said,
a
lawyer
can't
give
up
his
practice
and
go
into
the
business
of
debt
adjusting
and
your
position
is
if
that's
an
improper
interpretation.
