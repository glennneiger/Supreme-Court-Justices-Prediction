mr.
william
m.
ferguson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
constitutionality
of
a
kansas
statute
making
it
a
misdemeanor
to
engage
in
the
business
of
debt
adjusting
for
a
fee.
statute
has
a
proviso
that
the
provisions
of
this
act
shall
not
apply
to
those
situations
involving
debt
adjusting
as
herein
defined,
incurred
incidentally
in
the
lawful
practice
of
law
in
the
state.
i
might
say
to
the
court
that
debt
adjusting
is
an
activity,
a
business
activity
wherein
the
debtor
turns
the
portion
of
his
earnings
over
to
the
debt
adjustor
and
is
usually
as
a
result
of
solicitation
by
advertising
or
some
other
means.
then
the
adjustor
distributes
to
the
creditors
of
the
debtor
who
will
agree
to
the
plan
and
the
adjustor
charges
a
fee
and
it
is
usually
based
upon
the
total
amount
of
the
debt.
now
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
misdemeanor,
and
the
statute
does
not
affect
those
that
charge
no
fee.
this
case
was
brought
in
the
federal
district
court,
in
the
district
of
kansas
asking
for
an
injunction
and
for
declaratory
judgment.
action
was
brought
against
the
sedgwick
county,
county
attorney
and
the
attorney
general
state
of
kansas
as
defendants.
temporary
restraining
orders
were
issued
and
then
there
was
an
order
for
three-judge
court.
the
wichita
bar
association
filed
an
application
to
intervene
on
behalf
of
the
state
and
it
was
granted.
there
was
a
hearing
and
then
a
decision
by
the
three-judge
court,
two-to-one,
judge
stanley
dissenting,
declared
that
the
law
violated
due
process
and
is
unconstitutional.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision,
it's
found
on
page
126
of
the
transcript,
the
court
below
said
that
the
grounds
upon
which
this
action
is
predicated
or
that
the
act
is
void
because
it
violates
and
infringes
plaintiff's
rights
guaranteed
by
the
due
process
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
court
in
its
conclusion
of
law
concluded
that,
the
act
in
question
is
prohibitory
and
not
regulatory,
but
went
on
to
say
that
even
if
it's
construed
as
regulatory,
it
is
unreasonable,
unwarranted
regulation
of
a
lawful
businesses
and
therefore
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
rights
claimed
as
guaranteed
by
due
process
clause
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
only
question
here
involves
measuring
of
this
statute
against
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
there
are
13
states
that
have
similar
statutes.
seven
have
regulatory
statute,
your
honor.
two
of
those
13
are
purporting,
they
are
formed
to
be
regulatory,
but
are
in
fact
prohibitory.
they
are
west
virginia
and
ohio.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
this
is
the
criminal
statute.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no,
no.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
there
are
12
others.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes
[inaudible]
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well,
they
vary,
your
honor,
the
–-
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
but
georgia
is
almost
precisely
like
this
in
the
same
language.
massachusetts
involves
--
the
practice
of
law
makes
--
the
fact
makes
it
a
practice
of
law
in
due
debt
adjusting,
so
does
virginia.
the
new
jersey
statute
is
very
similar
to
this
one
except
that
they
spell
out
a
few
exceptions,
but
generally
speaking
the
statutes
are
quite
similar
in
all
the
states
that
prohibit,
in
the
seven
states
that
regulated
there
is
a
difference.
the
court
then
said
that,
the
lower
court
that
we
are
in
full
accord
with
the
reasoning
and
philosophy
of
the
pennsylvania
court.
what
they
were
referring
to
there
was
commonwealth
versus
stone,
which
struck
down
a
very
similar
statute
upon
the
authority
of
adams
versus
tanner
and
of
course
the
court
is
quiet
familiar
with
adams
versus
tanner,
the
landmark
case
of
those
cases
involving
substantive
or
commercial
due
process.
now
the
court
below
however
recognized
that
there
was
an
evil
in
this
particular
activity
in
saying
that
debt
adjustment
is
by
its
very
nature
may
lend
itself
to
great
abuses
and
because
of
this
the
state
has
power
to
regulate
it,
that
the
--
and
that
its
citizens
may
not
be
over
reached
by
unscrupulous
persons.
then
the
court
holds,
we
conclude
first
that
the
act
is
prohibitory
and
not
regulatory
and
that
it
prohibits
anyone
from
engaging
in
the
business
of
debt
adjustment,
but
even
if
the
exception
is
considered
as
regulatory
it
is
an
unreasonable
regulation
of
lawful
business.
then
the
court
turns
its
attention
to
the
exception
involved
with
respect
to
lawyers
and
said
this,
“to
say
that
the
lawyer
may
adjust
the
debt
solely
as
an
incident
to
a
case,
which
is
otherwise
before
him
is
most
unreasonable
and
the
state
of
kansas
appealed.
now,
there
are
--
is
just
one
basic
primary
question
here
and
that
is
whether
or
not
this
court
is
going
to
return
to
it's
--
the
old
philosophy
of
commercial
or
substantive
due
process
of
law.
there
is
a
secondary
question
which
i
will
discuss
because
it
was
so
strongly
urged
by
the
appellee
and
that's
the
question
of
the
affect
of
the
title
of
this
particular
act
as
measured
by
the
kansas
law.
we
feel
there
is
no
particular
significance,
but
i'll
discuss
it
if
time
allows.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
not
a
federal
question,
not
at
all.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
the
state
considers
of
no
significant
your
honor.
now
there
isn't
any
question
in
this
case
of
procedural
due
process.
the
act
was
regularly
adapted,
there
is
no
question
of
notice,
there
is
no
matter
of
vagueness,
there
is
no
violation
of
first
amendment
guarantees,
there
is
no
invasion
of
the
individual
liberties.
it's
simply
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
is
exercising
its
proper
function
when
it
measures
its
particular
idea
of
legislation
against
that
as
a
legislature.
in
other
words,
the
court
in
this
situation
substitutes
--
substituted
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
kansas
legislature
and
doing
so
followed
the
tanner
case,
1916
case,
where
the
court
in
that
case
said
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
proscribed
the
state
of
washington
from
prohibiting,
charging
the
fee
in
what
the
court
there
found
to
be
a
lawful
business,
namely
obtaining
employment
for
a
fee
and
as
i
had
pointed
out,
the
tanner
case
is
just
among
a
number
of
cases
that
up
until
the
middle
1930's
was
used
by
the
court
to
strike
down
enactments
of
the
various
state
legislatures
and
of
the
congress
for
reason
that
measured
against
the
fourteenth
amendment
the
court
found
that
it
was
unreasonable
and
struck
them
down.
among
those
cases
of
course
were
lochner
case,
striking
down
maximum
hours,
coppage
versus
kansas,
striking
down
the
yellow-dog
contracts,
wolff
packing
company
case,
striking
down
the
authority
to
fix
wages
in
hours,
yhe
lehman
case
on
prices,
and
in
our
own
state
there
is
still
some
residue
of
the
old
doctrine
of
substantive
due
process,
i
might
as
well
face
up
to
it,
gilbert
versus
matthews,
which
is
very
strongly
relied
upon
by
the
appellee
here.
there
is
--
the
kansas
court
there
struck
down
a
new
goods
auction
law
on
the
ground
that
it
was
unduly
restrictive,
and
although
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
that
case
there
were
some
other
matters
including
notice,
and
dual
regulations,
and
unreasonable
classifications
and
so
on.
now,
turning
to
debt
adjustments
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no,
tanner
has
not
been
expressly
overruled,
opposed
to
tanner
still
lingers.
it
has
been
said
to
be
undermined
in
several
cases,
but
it
has
never
been
expressly
overruled
your
honor.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
it
has
been
definitely
undermined
in
a
number
of
cases.
turning
now
to
debt
adjustment
itself,
here
the
state
has
the
authority
to
guard
its
people
against
evils
what
it
feels
to
be
inherent
in
this
particular
activity.
generally
the
clients
as
they
call
them,
they
are
debtors
who
go
to
these
debt
adjusters
are
low
income,
they're
uneducated,
they're
debt
ridden,
they're
poverty
stricken,
and
as
a
result
of
this
they
are
particularly
susceptible
to
the
wiles
of
debt
adjustment.
and
of
course
people
who
are
in
financial
difficulty
are
increasing
everyday
because
the
size
of
our
consumer
debt
has
now
risen
to
over
$61
billion.
and
they
advertise
this
way,
on
page
23
of
the
transcript
is
one
of
their
advertisements,
it
says,
“bills
pressing,
installment
payments
on
past
due,
bills
are
troubling
you,
let
us
consolidate
and
arrange
to
pay
all
your
bills
past
due
or
not,
with
one
low
payment
you
can
afford,”
and
then
they
go
on
to
say,
“if
you
owe
a
$1000
pay
as
low
as
$15
a
week.”
“if
you
owe
$2000
as
low
as
$25
a
week,
$3000
as
low
as
$30
a
week,”
and
they
say,
“no
security,
no
cosigners,”
and
they
say,
“if
you
have
debt
worries,
see
us.”
then
in
their
letter
to
the
creditors
they
say
that
this
released
the
creditors
of
the
burden
from
your
collection
department,
contact
us
concerning
all
payments
on
other
manners.
in
their
propaganda
to
the
debtors
they
say,
“we
will
keep
your
creditors
satisfied,
you
will
avoid
garnishments,
you
will
have
a
peace
of
mind.”
now
these
evils
of
or
possible
evils
of
debt
adjustment
were
well
known
to
the
legislature.
afl-cio,
the
executive
council
said
that
debt
adjustment
should
be
eliminated
in
1961.
the
national
better
business
bureau
incorporated
has
drawn
attention
to
what
they
call
a
situation
which
is
fast
approaching
a
national
scandal.
there
are
number
of
legal
publications
that
have
dealt
with
it.
the
unauthorized
practice
news
has
an
article
on,
“should
debt
adjusters
be
outlawed.”
the
legal
aid
briefcase
says
--
said
to
have
spoken
of
debt
adjustment
as
the
meanest
racket
out.
now
turning
to
the
other
states
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
the
basic
vice
is
one
of
three
things,
assuming
it's
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
either
that
the
activity
lends
itself
to
fraud,
because
they
--
and
the
evidence
in
the
transcript
reveals
that
they
very
seldom
ever
finish
these
arrangements.
a
man
comes
in,
he
turns
over
his
books,
his
records
of
what
his
obligations
are
to
the
debt
adjuster,
the
debt
adjuster
than
computes
a
fee
based
upon
the
total
amount
of
his
debt
and
then
the
debt
adjuster
endeavors
to
make
some
kind
of
an
arrangement
with
the
creditors.
and
if
the
creditors
are
unwilling
or
secured
or
for
whatever
reason,
then
there
isn't
anything
the
debt
adjuster
can
do.
and
then
he
tells
the
debtor,
well
i'm
sorry
there
isn't
anything
we
can
do
because
some
of
your
creditors
won't
agree
and
we
will
make
adjustments
only
with
those
who
will
and
of
course
there
is
rather
cold
comfort
too,
someone
who
has
been
lured
in
to
the
debt
adjuster
on
theory
that
he
can
get
his
bills
arranged
for
without
paying
any
interest
and
so
on,
that's
the
first
possibility
of
fraud.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
he
may
or
may
not
have,
but
in
this
case
there
was
an
indication
that
the
fee
was
from
5%
to
9%
in
this
particular
case,
but
he
--
and
he
becomes
liable
for
the
fee
when
he
signs
the
contract
and
ordinarily
only
the
debtor
signs
the
contract,
that
debt
adjuster
becomes
--
is
required
by
the
contract
to
do
nothing
in
particular.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
right
and
it
isn't
always
clear
to
the
debtor
of
course
that
part
of
the
fee
is
going
to
come
out
and
when
it's
going
to
come
out,
there
is
nothing
in
the
contract
ordinarily
is,
when
the
fees
to
be
taken.
the
evidence
in
the
transcript
shows
that
in
the
particular
cases
there
that
the
fee
taken
out
varied
from
25%
down
to
a
smaller
percent
of
a
particular
payment,
to
make
a
payment
or
two
and
then
a
man
goes
into
bankruptcy
or
he
is
garnisheed
or
something
and
that
thing
is
over.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well,
your
honor
there
are
two
other
aspects
of
this
thing
that
i
have
not
yet
mentioned.
one
is
that
the
legislatures
may
consider
that
he
is
getting
improper
legal
advice
from
the
debt
adjustor,
who
is
generally
a
layman
and
in
this
case
–-
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
still
will
take
advantage,
the
wage
earner
plan
or
something
of
this
type
or
that
it's
vice
because
they
don't
get
sufficient
legal
advice.
i
mean
its
either
get
improper
legal
advice
or
insufficient
legal
advice.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
our
practice
in
the
state
of
kansas
but
we
keep
no
record
of
the
committee
hearings.
we
do
not
–-
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
--
most
states,
yes.
we
keep
only
the
scantiest
kind,
i
served
four
terms
in
the
legislature,
and
we
keep
only
the
scantiest
kind
of
records
of
the
action
in
committee.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no,
not
ordinarily
your
honor.
the
only
journal
is
that
the
motions
that
are
made
and
the
activity
of
the
committee,
the
whole
or
whatever
the
particular
action
of
the
house
is,
the
count
of
the
votes
those
who
voted,
i
know
or
would
have
known.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well,
this
is
one
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised.
it
is
the
state's
contention
that
he
could,
but
it's
the
lower
court's
contention
that
he
could
not.
and
we
think
that
it's
relatively
immaterial
if
this
legislature
wanted
to
say
he
could
not
work
full
time,
devote
full
time,
he
is
not
in
oklahoma
for
instance,
the
lawyers
are
prescribed
from
debt
adjusting,
in
other
words
they
are
not
accepted
from.
but
the
futility
of
this
kind
of
service
in
due
process
is
made
clear
by
pennsylvania
for
instance.
there
the
court
struck
it
down
in
1959,
and
the
legislature
in
1961
enacted
a
new
act,
which
was
substantially
the
same
as
the
one
that
have
been
stricken
down,
except
that
they
changed
the
language
just
a
little
bit
and
added
a
few
more
exceptions.
so,
apparently
in
that
state
they
felt
that
it
was
sufficiently
important
that
when
one
act
was
struck
down
they
reenacted
another
one.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
state
court,
lower
court.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no
federal.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
on
the
basis
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
just
as
this
one
was
and
that
court
there
bottomed
its
decision
on
adams
versus
tanner
and
of
course
its
our,
that
we
submit
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well
as
i
read
the
case,
your
honor
they
said
that
the
act
is
prohibitory,
it
is
not
regulatory
and
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes
that's
correct,
your
honor,
except
they
said
that
to
say
that
a
--
or
their
particular
language
was
that
with
respect
to
lawyers,
they
said
that,
to
restrict
the
--
to
say
that
the
lawyer
may
adjust
debts
only
as
an
incident
to
a
case,
which
is
otherwise
before
him
is
most
unreasonable.
now,
county
attorney
sam
burns'
brief
argues
that
point
and
says
that
they're
not
compelled
by
the
language
of
the
act
to
reach
that
conclusion,
because
the
proviso
doesn't
say
regular
practice
of
law,
it
says
involving
debt
adjusting
is
herein
defined
incurred
incidentally
to
the
lawful
practice
of
law
in
this
state.
now
this
language
of
course
isn't
the
same
as
the
georgia
court.
our
court
was
little
--
the
lower
court
was
a
little
confused
about
that
and
said
that
they
knew
of
no
other
state
that
went
this
far.
a
number
of
other
states,
massachusetts
go
this
far,
except
that
they
don't
tie
it
down
to
--
incidentally
to
the
lawful
practice
of
the
law.
but
returning
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
court
grounded
its
decision
on
the
fact
that
this
was
prohibitory
and
not
regulatory.
and
then
they
said,
but
even
if
it
is
regulatory,
this
is
an
unreasonable
regulation
to
say
that
a
lawyer
may
not
do
it
incidental
to
the
practice
of
law.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
it
is.
there
is
no
question
about
this.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
at
least
pretend
that
the
layman
has
no
standing
to
contend
that
the
act
is
unconstitutional
because
of
its
regulation
of
the
lawyers
in
a
way
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no,
he
is
notified,
there
isn't
any
question
about
that.
and
this
is
what
the
legislature
intended
to
do
and
that's
what
they
did
do.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
they
were
against
this
debt
adjusting
by
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
this
activity
whereby
the
debtor
goes
to
a
layman
gives
him
his
current
records
and
papers
and
makes
a
contract
with
this
layman
to
distribute
a
portion
of
his
earnings
to
the
creditors
who
will
go
along
with
the
plan.
and
generally,
he
talks
it
over
with
--
the
layman
talks
it
over
with
the
debtor.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
private
marshaling
in
debts
–-
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
--
this
is
what
it
is.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
we
don't
use
it.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
we
rely
generally
on
the
bankruptcy
law
and
on
the
wage
earner
plan
and
so
on.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
no,
the
record
doesn't
reveal
anything
about
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
this
is
the
only
group
that
it
hit,
but
i
think
probably
the
answer
to
your
question
that
a
group
that
is
particularly
interested
in
addition
to
the
lawyers,
because
as
i
pointed
out,
massachusetts
and
virginia
proscribes
it
as
being
a
practice
of
the
law,
vermont
has
said
in
a
case
that
it
is
the
practice
of
law,
but
the
small
loan
companies
are
probably
in
impetus
to
it.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
the
small
loan
companies
were
doubtlessly
interested
in
it,
although
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
they
would
before
the
act,
proscribing
debt
adjustment.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
well,
i
suppose
as
they
--
if
they
couldn't
adjust
the
debts
in
this
way,
then
they'd
be
more
likely
to
come
to
the
small
loan
companies
and
borrow
the
money
and
pay
off
their
creditors,
but
they
make
--
in
debt
adjusting
of
course,
in
their
advertising
as
i
pointed
out,
they
make
quite
a
point.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
due
process.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
all.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
and
it's
prohibitory
and
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
that's
exactly
what
happened
here
and
our
point
is
that
in
kansas
there
had
been
a
state
case
and
a
debut
case
where
in
1936,
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
had
indicated
that
this
kind
of
thing
was
a
practice
of
law.
and
on
page
125
of
the
transcript,
there
had
been
lower
court
case
where
it
had
been
suggested
that
this
particular
defendant
had
been
involved
in
the
practice
of
law.
i
want
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
court
has
abandoned
this
substantive
due
process
concept
that
it
had
in
the
1930's
and
i
don't
need
to
enumerate
those
cases,
but
the
[inaudible]
insurance,
milk
parish
case
on
minimum
wages,
the
olsen
versus
nebraska
on
minimum
fees,
the
sage
stores
on
filled
milk.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
it's
in
one
of
the
cases
your
honor,
it
isn't
cited.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
it
isn't
cited
in
ours.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
the
daniel
versus
family
security
in
the
proscribing
undertakers
from
being
in
a
life
insurance
business.
lincoln
versus
northwestern,
now
this
is
the
case
mr.
justice
goldberg,
where
the
court
said
the
tanner
was
undermined.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes,
that
is
correct
sir.
now
the
tanner
doctrine
is
a
suggestion
that
the
service
must
be
useful
and
in
this
case
they
found
that
it
was
in
tanner
and
then,
if
it
is
useful
they
may
--
the
state
may
regulate
it,
but
may
not
prohibit
it.
now
the
dissent
in
that
case
was
brandeis
and
he
said
that
there
should
be
no
distinction,
and
there
should
be
no
restriction
on
the
state's
police
power
and
they
always
should
show
us
what
is
the
evil
and
what
is
the
remedy
and
that
has
been
this
court's
position
ever
since
the
discarding
of
this
concept
of
substantive
due
process.
i
would
just
mention
that
the
title
question
is
no
real
concern
here
neither
it
is
of
any
particular
concern
to
the
state
of
kansas.
we
found
that
there
were
264
cases
where
this
question
that
no
bail
should
contain
more
than
one
subject
and
in
221
of
them
the
court
brushed
us
aside.
there
isn't
anyway
we
can
harmonize
these
cases,
but
we
don't
feel
that
it
is
significant
here.
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
may
it
please
the
court.
i
just
point
out
that
the
state
of
kansas
could
have
regulated
this
activity,
but
it
chose
not
to
regulate
it,
it
chose
to
prohibit
it.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there
is
any
magic
in
the
fact
state
of
massachusetts,
which
has
almost
exactly
the
same
kind
of
a
law,
says
that
it
shall
be
deemed
to
be
the
practice
of
a
law
within
the
provisions
of
section
46
of
the
massachusetts
act,
that
this
would
make
it
good
to
do
it
the
way
we
did
it
would
make
it
fair.
of
course
this
court
is
fully
familiar
with
the
bird
case,
daniel
case
where
this
particular
court
has
held
that
the
state
may,
if
it
wishes
prohibit
an
otherwise
lawful
activity.
this
--
mr.
william
m.
ferguson
yes
i
--
the
gilbert
versus
mathews
case,
it
is
relied
to
some
extent
on
adams
versus
tanner,
and
so
did
the
stone
case
in
pennsylvania.
both
of
these
cases
we
feel
were
wrong,
in
as
much
as
they
were
adopting
the
principle
of
substantive
due
process.
but
the
mathews
case
in
kansas
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
it's
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
tanner
is
completely
alive
in
kansas
and
would
govern
this
case.
i
don't
think
we
can
assume
here
that
this
case,
this
statute
would
be
a
violation
of
the
kansas
constitution.
i
don't
think
it
is,
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
mathews
case
and
for
that
reason,
we
can't
see
that
there
is
any
difference
in
the
concept
in
this
court
of
the
matter
of
due
process,
the
matter
of
equal
protection.
this
court
has
said
in
the
sage
case
that
they
aren't
the
same.
in
the
sage
stores
case
versus
kansas,
where
they
prohibited
filled
milk.
this
argument
was
made
that
it
prohibited
the
sale
of
a
lawful
product
and
a
healthful
product.
and
in
the
sage
case
this
court
upheld
the
legislature
of
kansas'
determination
to
prohibit
filled
milk,
and
in
that
case
it
took
up
the
argument
equal
protection.
and
it
said
that
there
is
no
difference
between
equal
protection
here
and
due
process
here.
we
don't
measure
business
activity
against
the
fourteenth
amendment
anymore
and
that's
in
sum
and
substance
of
what
is
being
tried
to
do
here.
this
act
is
--
the
legislature
of
kansas
is
trying
to
protect
the
poor
debtors
from
nationally
recognized
evil
and
they
did
it
the
way
they
thought
was
prominent.
