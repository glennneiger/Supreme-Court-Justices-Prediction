mr.
lawrence
weigand
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
three
matters
the
appellee
would
like
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court
in
support
of
the
lower
court's
decision.
pardon
me.
there
are
three
propositions
which
the
appellee
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
in
support
of
the
opinion
below.
one
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
the
act
in
question
is
practically
a
verbatim
copy
of
the
pennsylvania
statute.
the
only
change
being
that
the
pennsylvanian
statute
had
a
label
they
called
it
budget
planning
and
kansas
changed
it
to
debt
adjusting
and
pennsylvania
imposed
a
fine
of
$500
and
one
year
in
jail
and
kansas
cut
the
jail
sentence
to
six
months,
but
they
kept
$500
plan.
now,
this
act
prior
to
its
adoption
in
kansas
had
been
declared
unconstitutional
by
the
pennsylvania
court
and
i
have
cited
both
pennsylvania
law
and
the
doctrine
of
adams
versus
tanner
in
support
of
the
unconstitutionality
of
the
act.
therefore,
when
it
came
to
the
court
below,
it
had
already
had
adjudication
by
a
judicial
tribunal
that
it
was
unconstitutional.
now
despite
that
fact
and
despite
the
fact
that
the
particular
definition,
which
is
prohibited
by
the
act,
and
the
only
thing
that
is
prohibited
is
to
make
a
contract
express
or
implied
with
a
particular
debtor,
whereby
the
debtor
agrees
to
pay
a
certain
amount
of
money
periodically
to
the
person
engaged
in
the
debt
adjusting
business,
who
shall
for
a
consideration
distribute
the
same
among
certain
specified
creditors
in
accordance
of
the
plan
agreed
upon.
the
act
that's
involved
and
made
criminal
here
is
one
that
is
a
voluntary
matter
between
a
principal
and
an
agent
whereby
the
principal
desire
is
to
hire
an
agent
to
distribute
his
own
money,
the
way
the
principal
wants
it
distributed
and
that
is
the
activity,
which
the
kansas
act
seeks
to
make
criminal.
now
that
act,
i
submit
is
a
lawful
activity
and
while
it
is
one
that
might
be
affected
with
the
public
interest
and
subject
to
stringent
regulations
is
not
under
the
doctrine
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
and
of
this
court
up
to
now,
subject
to
prohibition
but
is
subject
to
strict
regulation,
now
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
i
think
it
is
very
definite
with
respect
to
the
act
that
is
made
illegal.
i
think
it's
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
if
we
are
correct
in
the
assumption
on
what
that
is
based
that
the
act
does
say
that
whoever
does
this
specific
act
that
i
have
defined
shall
be
guilty
of
a
crime.
now,
if
the
decision
of
the
court
would
turn
on
the
oblique
matter,
which
local
committee
of
the
bar
at
one
time
attempted
to
assert
and
which
they
have
now
not
even
attempted
to
come
into
this
court
in
support
that
the
exception
is
a
validating
circumstance
with
respect
to
the
matter,
and
it
takes
on
the
guise
of
regulation.
then
we
get
into
several
subsidiary
questions
such
as,
what
does
it
enact,
which
expressly
violates
the
constitution
of
the
state
with
respect
to
the
manner
of
its
passage?
is
it
not
the
enforcement
of
it
in
a
criminal
manner
against
an
individual,
a
matter
of
depriving
him
of
due
process
of
law
and
that
would
get
into
the
matter,
mr.
justice
stewart
that
you
asked
the
counsel
about
with
respect
to
[inaudible]
mr.
lawrence
weigand
and
only
in
that
way.
now
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
if
i
might
add,
my
question
--
put
it
--
my
answer
to
your
question,
if
your
honor
please
that
i
know
of
no
similar
statute
that
you
have
upheld.
i
know
of
no
similar
enactment,
which
has
taken
a
lawful
business
activity
and
declared
it
to
be
criminal
and
prohibited
it,
which
this
court
has
said
that
a
state
might
do.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
i
was
going
to
discuss
that
your
honor,
mr.
justice
black
please.
in
olsen,
they
took
and
prescribed
the
rate
--
they
regulated
and
prescribed
the
fees
that
could
be
charged.
olsen
and
adams
versus
tanner
i
submit
are
sort
of
consistent
with
one
another,
if
i
might
discuss
it
in
this
claim.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
adams
versus
tanner
said
that
the
business
of
a
man
acting
as
agent
for
a
man
seeking
employment
was
a
lawful
business
activity
and
while
it
was
subject
to
regulation
could
not
be
prohibited.
olsen
versus
nebraska
took
the
very
act
of
an
employment
agency
and
limited
the
charges
that
could
be
made
and
this
court
upheld
olsen
as
a
regulatory
measure
and
struck
down
adams
as
a
prohibition
of
the
act.
now
again
when
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
that
is
a
question
where
the
matter
was
not
--
first,
it
was
one
of
public
help,
and
i
think
that
there
are
different
categories
with
respect
to
types
of
regulations
that
maybe
more
stringent
or
less
stringent
with
respect
to
it.
and
in
the
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
yes,
but
the
limitation
that
this
court
has
always
put
even
as
late
as
the
goldblatt
case
when
it
used
the
--
upheld
the
zoning
regulation.
it
said
in
that
case,
if
i
might
quote
from
it.
i
don't
have
it,
but
that
the
means
adopted
must
be
reasonable
to
protect
against
the
abuse
that
was
threatened.
now
to
protect
against
fraud,
you
can
have
integrity
background,
no
criminal
records,
you
can
have
bonds
that
will
reinstate
for
the
person
any
amount
of
money
of
his
that
is
embezzled.
you
can
have
many
safeguards
against
fraud.
if
fraud
--
and
the
possibility
of
fraud
is
a
means
by
which
the
state
legislatures
are
permitted
by
this
court
to
prevent
businesses
then
a
real
estate
broker
can
be
prohibited
from
that
provisional
activity,
a
banker
can
be
prohibited
because
he
has
an
opportunity
to
embezzle
the
funds.
practically,
every
business
transaction
in
the
world,
as
long
as
human
beings
are
conducting
them
are
subject
to
fraud.
and
with
respect
to
ordinary
activities,
if
we
allow
those
to
be
prohibited
rather
than
regulated
with
respect
to
it,
i
submit
that
the
guarantees
of
the
federal
constitution
are
so
narrow
as
to
be
a
deprivation
in
due
process
in
the
pursuit
of
happiness
and
the
liberty
of
which
a
citizen
is
otherwise
guaranteed.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
and
i
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
no,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
the
due
process
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
constitution
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
we
charge
both,
if
the
court
pleases;
i
think
the
strongest
position
is
with
respect
to
due
process
of
law.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
i
didn't
understand
that
this
court
had
ever
said,
while
it
held
in
substance
what
your
honor
has
stated
if
i
maybe
at
liberty
to
make
this
comment.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
said
that
the
state
could
determine
for
itself,
that
it
could
prohibit
an
ordinary
legal
activity
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
pardon
me
i
didn't
mean
legal
--
i
mean
an
ordinary
activity
that
in
and
of
itself
is
lawful
unless
made
criminal
by
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well,
but
i
think
there
is
another
limitation.
it
must
be
necessary
or
reasonably
necessary
for
the
state
to
prohibit
it
in
order
to
protect
itself
against
the
abuses
that
are
inherent
in
it.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
and
i
submit
your
honor
that
in
adams
versus
tanner
in
new
state
ice
versus
liebmann.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
that
is
the
first
question
that
court
has
to
meet,
but
if
the
court
should
determine
that
contrary
to
the
contingents
made
by
the
appellees,
i
submit
this
court
must
still
uphold
the
lower
court,
because
of
another
constitutional
deprivation
of
this
statute
results
in
and
that
is
that
it
was
enacted
contrary
to
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
kansas
constitution,
as
clearly
interpreted
by
the
kansas
supreme
court
and
that
construction
of
the
kansas
constitution
by
the
kansas
supreme
court
is
not
inhibited
or
prohibited
by
any
federal
constitutional
provision.
and
so,
that
within
the
limits
of
the
federal
constitution,
if
a
kansas
constitution
guarantees
that
we,
no
we
shall
not
be
subjected
to
the
law,
except
that
it
meets
certain
prescribed
conditions
and
what
the
kansas
supreme
court
says
is
a
lawful
constitutional
provision
of
the
state
of
kansas
and
if
this
law
does
not
meet
that
and
if
you
will
note
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
they
did
say
that
with
respect
to
this
specific
statute,
but
they
announced
a
rule
of
law
seven
months
before
this
legislature
ignored
it
in
the
case
of
guilty
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
yes.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
yes
being
difficult
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
the
due
process
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
safeguards
a
person
against
the
kansas
legislature
taking
away
his
rights,
which
he
has
under
the
kansas
constitution,
because
it
thereby
denies
him
equal
protection
of
the
kansas
constitution,
which
is
to
be
enforced
against
all
people
equally
and
so
far
is
as
applicable.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
yes
and
the
due
process
clause,
both.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well,
we
have
no
direct
access
to
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
and
we
had
to
go
through
a
local
judge
who
had
already
expressed
--
this
is
not
in
the
record
that's
why
we
didn't
go
in,
because
this
man
is
a
non-resident
of
the
state
of
kansas
and
because
of
the
kansas
constitution
entitles
non-residents
to
the
same
protection
of
the
constitution
by
specific
provision,
as
it
does
to
the
residents,
we
were
able
to
get
into
the
federal
court
on
two
grounds.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well
i
think
we
could
have.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
we
could,
we
could.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
the
lower
court
cited
the
case
that
i
referred
to
in
the
opinion.
the
opinion
and
i
am
speaking
to
all
of
the
federal
judges,
which
are
rendered
by
two
of
the
circuit
judges
of
the
tenth
circuit
judge
hexman
and
judge
dempsey
hill
cited
that
gilbert
versus
matthews
were
the
rule
of
adams
versus
tanner
as
i
have
enunciated
it
to
the
court.
in
other
words,
that
a
business
while
it
was
subject
to
public
interest
and
was
subject
to
regulation,
the
law
in
kansas
did
not
prohibit
the
legislature
to
prohibit
that
business
even
though
they
could
regulate
it.
and
if
you
will
note
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
they
cite
gilbert
versus
matthews
as
the
principles
upon
which
they
declared
this
unconstitutional
and
they
cited
them
by
reference
the
adoption
of
the
rationale
and
the
holding
of
the
pennsylvania
court
with
respect
to
the
same
statute
and
the
pennsylvania
case
of
commonwealth
versus
stone
in
addition
to
citing
adams
versus
tanner
cited
a
pennsylvania
supreme
court
case
that
announced
the
same
rule
with
respect
to
that
state
that
kansas
did
in
gilbert
versus
matthews.
in
another
words,
pennsylvania
and
kansas
supreme
courts
have
both
held
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
kansas
in
exercise
of
its
police
power
can
regulate,
but
it
cannot
prohibit
a
lawful
business
activity.
so
the
only
way
that
they
can
strike
--
uphold
this
act
and
strike
down
the
majority
opinion
below
is
to
convince
your
honors
that
one
adams
versus
tanner
that
has
no
application
and
two,
something
about
the
reputation
or
undermining
of
adams
versus
tanner
makes
it
impossible
for
a
state
court
to
construe
that
rule
of
law
is
applicable
to
the
exercise
of
police
power
by
that
state
and
i
submit
that
this
court
has
never
found
any
basis
upon
which
to
fail
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
oh
indeed.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
we
did
and
we
also
argued
in
addition
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well,
it
cites
as
the
principles
of
law
applicable,
they
don't
say
that
they
ground
it
solely
on
that,
because
i
think
the
court
will
definitely
felt
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
it
said
the
principles
of
law
applicable
to
this
case
were
enunciated
in
gilbert
versus
matthew's,
which
is
a
the
pronouncement
of
the
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well
and
your
honor
if
i
had
failed
to
make
my
position
clear,
it's
the
federal
constitution
that
we
think
that
protects
us
against
the
enforcement
of
a
kansas
law
that
violates
the
kansas
constitution.
i
think
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well,
i
have
never
had
any
doubt
and
i
don't
think
the
majority
of
the
court
below
had
any
doubt
that
there
was
any
divergence
between
the
construction
by
the
kansas
supreme
court
of
the
law
applicable
to
the
kansas
legislature
and
that
announcement
this
court
in
adams
versus
tanner,
which
the
cert
that
i
made
of
it
maybe
inadequate
was
that
this
court
had
never
said,
we
hereby
disapprove
or
we
hereby
over
rule,
the
rule
of
law
that
a
state
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
power
can
take
a
lawful
business
activity
and
make
it
criminal
where
it
can
be
regulated
and
that
was
the
rule
that
is
consistently
announced
both
in
adams
versus
tanner.
it
was,
i
submit
consistent
with
the
holding
of
this
court
in
olsen
versus
nebraska.
it
wasn't
involved
in
the
lincoln
federal
labor
matter.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
decision
in
the
lower
court
below
quoted
the
following;
a
right
to
regulate
does
not
carry
with
it
the
right
to
adopt
unreasonable
or
unfair
regulations.
the
kansas
supreme
court
when
they
cited
a
support
of
that
proposition
had
enacted
this
decision
just
seven
months
before
the
legislature,
ignoring
it,
passed
this
prohibitory
law.
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
stated
the
business
factor
of
public
interest
is
subject
to
reasonable
legislative
restriction,
and
regulation
to
prevent
abuses
and
frauds.
requirements
for
the
licensing
in
that
case
of
auctioneers
as
well
as
other
auction
regulations
which
are
reasonable
and
not
wholly
arbitrary
have
long
been
upheld,
“the
right
to
regulate
and
license
the
business
does
not
however
include
the
right
to
prohibit
it
directly
or
in
effect
to
adopt
unreasonable
and
unfair
regulations
or
such
regulations
as
would
be
oppressive
or
highly
injurious
to
the
business.”
now
that
decision
is
of
course
very
similar
to
the
language
and
the
ruling
and
the
teaching
of
this
court
in
adam
versus
tanner.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
if
that
choice
of
words
is
determinative
i
have
to
submit
that
the
use
of
those
words
in
that
decision
was
in
a
decision,
which
did
not
involve
this
type
of
regulation.
it
involved
a
right
to
work
bill
where
the
converse
of
this
proposition
was
being
enforced
by
the
court.
and
where
they
were
saying
that
the
legislature
could
guarantee
to
a
man
his
right
to
employment,
and
could
keep
an
employer
and
a
union
from
combining
to
prevent
this
man
an
equal
opportunity
to
employment,
which
i
submit
would
make
in
a
sense
the
use
of
the
word
undermining
rather
dicta.
now,
olsen
versus
nebraska,
which
was
cited
by
the
language
there,
was
a
case
which
we
say,
we
would
mind
not
at
all
if
kansas
had
imposed
a
regulation
upon
the
fees
or
charges,
which
a
man
could
charge
for
acting
as
agent
for
another
and
distributing
his
money
in
accordance
of
that's
man
wishes,
that
would
be
a
reasonable
regulation,
it
would
be
designed
to
protect
the
man
from
overreaching,
and
coupled
with
the
requirement
for
a
bond,
and
a
good
business
reputation
or
no
criminal
record,
and
any
such,
very
stringent,
but
adequate
regulations
would
not
be
contested
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
have
before
the
judiciary
committee,
the
judiciary
committee
of
the
senate
of
kansas
at
the
present
time
has
a
bill
which
they
have
introduced,
which
will
regulate
this
business
and
which
doesn't
prohibit
it
and
which
conforms
with
the
title
of
the
act
in
accordance
with
the
kansas
constitution.
i
have
no
assurance
that
that
will
be
passed
because
there
are
powerful
interests
that
would
like
to
eliminate
this
because
of
the
--
we
have
a
3%
of
funds
--
loan
law
in
kansas,
which
permits
these,
i
would
loosely
use
a
language,
loosely
loan
charts
from
making
huge
sums
of
money
in
advertising
to
people
to
consolidate
their
debts.
now,
one
of
the
invidious
discrimination
that
this
act
imposes
upon
an
ordinary
man
of
honesty
and
integrity
is
this;
he
cannot
for
a
small
consideration
or
for
any
consideration,
distribute
your
money
for
you
the
way
you're
asking
to
do
it.
but
a
small
loan
company
can
take
and
by
virtue
of
getting
their
consideration
in
usury
or
in
interest
rather,
i
shouldn't
say
usury,
in
interest
can
take
and
distribute
those
--the
money
of
that
man
to
those
debtors
and
it
is
not
against
the
imposition
or
the
criminal
penalties
of
this
act.
they
get
around
it
by
the
clever
use
of
the
word
periodically.
they
only
do
it
once
with
each
loan.
whereas
a
man
who
has
no
money
and
doesn't
want
to
pay
interest
rates,
takes
from
your
salary
an
amount
that
permits
he
and
his
family
to
live
adequately
and
with
the
desire
to
avoid
bankruptcy
and
so
forth
he
wants
to
pay
and
extract
himself
from
a
position
which
is
economic
in
this
country.
there
is
no
regulation
in
kansas
against
the
extending
of
credit.
the
ads
will
induce
these
poor
people
to
buy
a
refrigerator
today
and
start
paying
for
it
next
wednesday
or
next
month
or
--
and
the
need
for
this
service
is
a
real
need,
because
a
man
has
a
right,
i
submit
to
your
honor,
to
get
the
help
of
a
man
to
do
a
simple
thing
without
imposing
legal
penalties
on
him
if
the
manner
in
which
it
is
done
does
not
overreach
or
abuse
by
fraud
or
similar
matters
that
are
subject
to
curtailment,
but
which
this
act
makes
no
attempt
at
all
in
this
arbitrary
and
capricious
way
to
reach.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
that
perhaps
would
be
within
the
power.
i
wouldn't
argue
that
because
to
do
that
in
kansas
they
would
have
to
put
in
the
title
of
the
act,
a
warning
so
that
i
could
go
up
and
talk
to
the
legislature
and
any
member
of
the
public
could
talk
to
the
legislature
and
see
if
there
was
--
able
to
persuade
them,
whether
that
was
a
reasonable
regulation
or
not.
i
don't
say
that
it
would
be
without
the
power
of
the
kansas
legislature
to
classify
any
particular
act
to
those
who
are
best
able
to
do
it.
i
submit
to
your
honors
that
it
wouldn't
be
practical
in
this
instance,
the
matter
of
distributing
money
for
a
debtor
to
various
creditors
is
largely
a
clerical
operation.
it's
not
anything
that
involves
--
there
is
nothing
in
here
about
advice
and
counsel
like
there
was
in
the
ferman
act
of
massachusetts.
there
is
nothing
in
here
that
prevents
advising
counsel.
a
man
can
under
this
act
escape
the
penalties
of
illegal
practice
of
law
by
advising
those
people
what
to
do
with
respect
to
compositions
as
long
as
he
don't
distribute
their
money
for
a
consideration.
the
thing
that's
made
criminal
is
the
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
act
of
allowing
me
to
distribute
your
money
for
you
the
way
you
ask
me
to
do
it
and
that
and
that
alone
is
what
is
that
is,
what
the
court
struck
down
in
this
act.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
i
have
no
idea,
if
i
might
be
permitted
to
go
off
the
record
i
talked
to
one
of
the
members
of
the
senates
who
passed
it.
he
was
a
former
law
partner
of
my
esteem
colleague,
the
attorney
general
and
he
told
me
that
he
thought
it
was
unconstitutional
when
it
was
passed,
but
it
was
brushed
through
as
a
bill
desired
by
the
local
bar
association
meeting
and,
well
i
belong
to
the
sedgwick
county
bar
for
over
35
years,
i
did
not
know
of
the
existence
of
this
bill
or
that
the
chairman
of
the
ethics
committee,
who
also
represents,
well,
i'm
going
far
off
field
from
a
record
and
i
perhaps
should
not
go
with
respect
to
this
but
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
yes
and
i
submit
three
things,
if
i
may
your
honor
in
support
of.
they
adopted
a
bill
almost
verbatim
that
it
already
by
judicial
scrutiny
been
said
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
the
pennsylvania
court
from
where
they
got
the
act.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
two
acts
and
we
put
them
side
by
side
in
the
page
in
motion
to
affirm,
so
that
the
court
could
see
that
it
was
nothing
but
the
really
adoption
of
the
pennsylvania
act
after
it
had
been
declared
unconstitutional.
and
the
timing
in
which
this
act
was
put
in
by
the
kansas
legislature
was
seven
months
after
the
publication
of
the
decision
in
gilbert
versus
matthews,
where
our
supreme
court
unequivocally
said
that
this
legislature
did
not
under
its
police
power
have
the
right
to
prohibit
an
otherwise
lawful
activity.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well
we
also
thought
it
violated
the
constitution
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
yes,
but
why
should
a
man
be
relegated
to
two
forums
for
a
determination
of
a
question
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well
i
submit
though
that
where
the
clarity
of
the
state
in
pronouncement
leaves
no
doubt
that
there
is
no
reason
to
hold
this
in
abeyance
pending
a
declaration
to
that
which
is
obviously
clear.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well
we
relied
to
some
extent
on
dodd
versus
hodge,
where
you
said
that
the
three
judge
federal
court
could
pass
upon
the
unconstitutionality
of
an
illinois
statute
with
respect
to
invidious
discrimination
and
in
[inaudible]
you
upheld
the
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
i
think
this
is
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
by
permitting
the
loan
companies
to
do
this
act
as
long
as
it
isn't
periodic
and
permitting
everybody
else
to
--
unless
the
provision
with
respect
now
in
constructing
--
in
the
construing
of
this
statute,
the
lower
court
below
had
to
take
into
consideration
a
presumption
that
they
didn't
fly
on
the
face
of
the
article
2,
section
16
of
the
kansas
constitution
that
says
“nothing
in
the
subject
matter
of
the
act,
shall
be
included,
which
is
not
expressly
clearly
expressed
in
the
title”
and
may
i
read?
mr.
lawrence
weigand
yes.
but
when
a
federal
--
three-judge
federal
court
construes
a
statute
to
determine
whether
it
violates
the
kansas
constitution,
it
shouldn't
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
they
said
it
was
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
no
because
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well
and
they
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well
i
didn't
know
that
this
court
had
ever
come
to
the
final
conclusion
that
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
regulation
--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well--
mr.
lawrence
weigand
respectfully
submit
belongs
to
this
act
of
the
kansas
legislature
and
if
it
does,
it
certainly
violates
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
lawrence
weigand
well
the
construction
which
this
court
has
previously
given
in
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
understood
--
