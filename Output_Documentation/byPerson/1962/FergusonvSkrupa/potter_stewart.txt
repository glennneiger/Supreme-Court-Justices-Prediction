justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
the
criminal
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there
are
only
two
others,
two
other
criminal
statutes?
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
more?
justice
potter
stewart
criminal
statutes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
nothing
--
that's
not
a
federal
question.
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
don't
--
offhand
you
would
be
speaking
for
myself
alone,
but
it's
of
no
significance
at
all
in
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
fee
is
generally
taken
out
of
the
periodic
payments
on
an
installment
basis,
isn't
that?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
basic
vice
as
i
understand
is
that
these
people
really
don't
perform
any
service
that
the
debtor
himself
couldn't
do
whether
they
just
by
paying
his
bills
on
a
periodic
basis.
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
for
example,
a
lawyer
might
properly
advice
him
to
go
into
bankruptcy.
justice
potter
stewart
but
as
to
this
man
it's
clearly,
absolutely
prohibitory?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
a
lawyer
as
a
proper
party
to
test
the
meaning
of
the
exception
[inaudible]
the
lawyer.
justice
potter
stewart
this
man
is
not
concerned
with
that
exception
in
any
event
[inaudible]
justice
potter
stewart
so,
as
stated
that
makes
it
a
federal
offense.
justice
potter
stewart
yeah.
