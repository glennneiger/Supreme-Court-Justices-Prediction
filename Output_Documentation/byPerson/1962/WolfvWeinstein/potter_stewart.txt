well,
this
wouldn't
have
been
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
in
a
state
court?

okay
and
i
don't
quite
see
--
perhaps
i'm
sufficiently
sensitive,
but
i
don't
see
where
the
conflict
of
interest
would
be
for
an
employee
to
buy
stock
in
a
corporation
in
which
he
is
employed.
it
would
be
to
his
interest
to
have
the
corporation
have
the
stock
go
up,
and
the
corporation
to
succeed?
justice
potter
stewart
in
or
out,
i'm
just
wondering
where
the
conflict
of
interest
is?
