mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
review
two
companion
cases,
which
were
argued
below
and
decided
together
in
november
1961.
now
both
cases
arise
out
of
proceedings
for
the
reorganization
of
the
corporation
under
chapter
10
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
veteran
reorganization
is
nazareth
fairgrounds
and
farmers'
market,
inc,
a
pennsylvania
corporation.
the
proceedings
began
in
september
1953,
when
the
debtor
filed
a
voluntary
petition
for
reorganization
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
petition
was
approved.
no
trustee
was
appointed.
the
debtor
was
continued
in
possession
under
his
former
management
and
the
proceedings
were
referred
to
judge
sugarman
of
the
district
court
and
judge
sugarman
has
tried
all
the
matters
that
are
before
the
court
here.
now
the
first
case
designated
no.
27000
in
the
court
of
appeal,
presents
an
erie
v.
tompkins
question
to
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
court
has
non-diversity
jurisdiction
and
this
is
the
wrinkle
in
the
erie
situation.
the
rules
of
decision
act
provides
that
a
federal
court
in
any
civil
action
apply
state
rules
of
decision,
except
where
a
federal
statute
or
a
federal
policy
supervenes.
we
submit
that
in
this
case
on
the
substantive
questions
in
no.
27000,
there
is
no
federal
statute
and
no
federal
policy
that
even
touches
those
substantive
matters.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes
sir,
who
owns
the
stock
in
this
debtor.
now
there
is
no
plan
of
reorganization
pending,
there
is
no
creditor
problem.
in
this
case,
the
debtor
is
solvent
in
the
bankruptcy
sense;
its
assets
have
exceeded
his
liabilities
from
the
day
this
petition
was
filed.
there
is
no
question
of
priority
among
the
stockholders;
there
is
a
single
class
of
common
stock.
the
problem
really
is
that
there
was
an
over
issue
of
stock
in
1953,
before
the
reorganization
began.
the
articles
of
incorporation
authorize
an
issuance
of
200
shares
and
the
man
who
ran
this
show
before
the
reorganization,
issued
316
at
least.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
oh!
yes
sir,
certainly.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes
sir.
there
is
no
question
of
jurisdiction
your
honor.
the
question
is,
what
rules
of
decision
does
the
bankruptcy
court,
this
federal
court,
regardless
of
jurisdiction
use
to
decide
who
those
stockholders
are.
in
effect,
it's
my
contention,
the
petitioners
submit,
that
it's
a
matter
of
pure
accident
of
fortuity
that
the
case
is
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
it's
a
matter
of
convenience.
it
was
a
happy
accident
that
the
debtor
filed
a
petition,
which
stated
in
paragraph
one,
your
petitioner
is
insolvent.
this
was
voluntary.
on
ex
parte
orders,
the
petition
was
approved
and
the
debtor
was
continued
in
possession.
the
great
advantage
was
at
that
point
that
under
section
196
of
chapter
10,
judge
sugarman
issued
these
bar
orders,
which
said,
“all
stockholders
are
to
file
proofs
of
claim.”
at
this
point,
there
was
no
problem
of
getting
all
the
stockholders
in
new
york,
new
jersey
and
pennsylvania
into
a
single
forum.
this
was
the
great
convenience.
so,
everybody
came
into
the
one
forum
in
new
york,
the
southern
district
in
a
reorganization
proceeding
and
then,
we
had
a
single
lawsuit
to
determine
this,
but
none
of
this
has
anything
to
do
with
the
substantive
law
to
be
applied
for
all
the
difference
it
made
for
all
these
people
had
been
residents
of
new
york
or
one
state.
it
would
have
wound
up
in
a
state
court,
because
you
could
have
got
personal
service
and
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter.
now
petitioner
submits
it
shouldn't
make
a
bit
of
difference
whether
you
are
in
a
federal
court
on
diversity
grounds
or
on
non-diversity
grounds
or
in
a
state
court,
new
york
or
pennsylvania
as
to
what
law
governs
to
decide
who
these
stockholders
are.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
well
your
honor
let
me
bring
--
that's
true,
but
the
fact
that
it's
in
bankruptcy
again
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
question.
the
bankruptcy
law
essentially
and
this
goes
to
the
reorganization
too,
it's
a
matter
of
protecting
unsecured
creditors
who
have
no
interest
in
the
estate.
the
property
is
still
owned
by
the
bankrupt,
we
have
to
use
the
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
your
honor
chapter
10
permits
an
adjustment
of
the
interest
of
secured
creditors
and
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
sir?
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
including
stockholders.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
that's
right
sir.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
your
honor
there
is
no
question.
let
me
withdraw
my
former
statement,
which
is
an
overstatement.
there
is
no
question
that
the
court
has
power
to
adjust
or
for
that
matter
to
wipe
out
the
rights
of
stockholders
or
any
class
of
creditors
under
chapter
10.
i'm
not
disputing
the
power
of
the
court
or
certainly
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
but
the
focus
on
this,
let
me
put
it
to
you
honors
this
way.
suppose
you
have
one
share
of
valid
stock
and
from
my
point
of
view,
it
makes
no
difference
how
many
shares
a
valid
stock
are
outstanding.
what's
happened
here
is
that,
let's
say
two
persons
or
36
as
in
this
case
have
gone
into
this
court
and
they
are
competing
for
the
ownership
of
this
one
valid
share.
now
you
have
to
distinguish
between
the
corporation's
interest,
direct
interest
of
the
corporation
and
the
derivative
interest
of
any
person
through
the
corporation,
that's
one
matter
as
against
the
rights
of
third
parties
between
themselves.
if
one
person
is
contesting
something
with
the
corporation
as
to
whether
the
stock
is
valid
or
invalid
then
the
corporation
has
an
interest
and
maybe
the
bankruptcy
act
would
have
some
application
to
it.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
your
question.
what
comes
over
to
me
is
the
question
of
whether
the
court
and
this
is
a
subordinate
question,
is
whether
the
bankruptcy
court
with
non-diversity
federal
jurisdiction
sits
as
an
erie
court
and
first
applies
a
conflict
of
laws
rule
of
the
forum
state.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
your
honor,
i
submit
that
weinstein
reserves
this
question
as
to
what
substantive
law
would
be
applied.
what
happened
in
the
weinstein
case
to
begin
with
is
that
you
had
a
compound
interest
question
that
where
secured
creditors
were
concerned,
it
affected
of
the
unsecured
creditors
and
there
were
two
opinions.
the
majority
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black
found
that
this
was
a
question
of
substantive
federal
interest
that
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
the
federal
court
would
not
permit
compound
interest
to
be
applied
in
favor
of
a
secured
creditor
and
in
that
way
deprive
unsecured
creditors
a
part
of
the
estate.
now
if
in
this
case
anyone
can
show
any
federal
interest
under
the
bankruptcy
act
or
any
other
statute
or
any
other
policy
that
bears
on
this
question
of
stock
ownership
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
the
rules
of
decision
act
with
the
exception
or
the
proviso
says,
you
know
except
where
the
federal
constitution
treaties
or
statutes
so
provide.
now
if
someone
can
point
to
some
substantive
federal
interest
on
this
question
of
stock
ownership,
then
that's
the
end
of
it,
then
federal
law
applies,
but
what
i'm
saying
is
the
bare
fact
that
it's
in
a
bankruptcy
court
does
not
in
itself
determine
where
federal
law
applies.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
i
would
say
no
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
no,
no,
it's
much
beyond
that.
they
both
started
by
looking
to
the
pennsylvania
constitution
and
that's
where
they
stopped.
they
read
this
article
16,
section
7
of
the
pennsylvania
constitution,
which
says
in
effect,
“any
stock
issued
by
a
pennsylvania
corporation
without
consideration
is
void.”
and
then
they
stopped
there
and
what
you'll
find
in
judge
moore's
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
is
no
reference
to
the
underlying
statutes
and
no
reference
to
the
pennsylvania
case
law.
now
this
i
say
is
in
the
very
teeth
of
erie,
that
under
the
erie
decision
and
perhaps
even
under
swift
versus
tyson.
the
whole
point
was
that
state
laws
differ
and
that
if
you
have
to
make
an
interpretation
of
state
law,
you
look
to
what
the
local
court,
in
this
case,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
says
this
law
means.
now
what
judge
moore
did
was
to
disregard
completely
the
statutes
and
the
case
law
in
pennsylvania
and
then
he
went
far
beyond
that
not
simply
--
he
disregarded
the
state
law
as
to
voiding
all
of
this
stock.
and
then,
in
establishing
a
remedy,
which
he
called
the
matter
of
equity
and
this
is
all
he
called
it,
he
said,
“we'll
do
equity”
in
the
broadest
terms
with
no
reference
to
any
law,
he
then
established
a
pattern
of
stock
ownership,
which
had
no
reference
whatever
to
pennsylvania
law
or
new
york
law,
it's
wrong
and
it's
arbitrary
we
submit
even
as
a
matter
of
general
equity
under
all
federal
cases,
but
certainly
you
can't
possibly
justify
it
under
pennsylvania
or
new
york
law.
and
my
point
is
that
if
the
rules
of
decision
act
says
what
it
means,
it
means
what
it
says.
in
all
civil
actions
the
grounds
of
jurisdiction
don't
matter
and
this
court
is
not
there
just
to
do
equity
in
the
same
old
swift
versus
tyson
sense
of
applying
a
general
equity
or
a
sort
of
federal
common
law.
there
is
no
federal
interest
here
and
they
should
have
applied
state
law.
it's
not
simply
error
in
the
interpretation
and
application
of
state
law,
it's
a
total
disregard
of
state
law.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
well,
first
of
all
your
honor,
judge
moore
began,
and
this
is
the
foundation
of
his
decision
by
saying,
“every
single
share
of
stock
of
this
corporation
is
void
for
lack
of
consideration.”
and
to
begin
with,
he
has
ignored
the
over
issue,
but
let
that
pass,
because
nobody
–-
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
this
over
issue
of
stock,
your
honor.
what
he
says
is
the
corporation
did
not
receive
any
consideration
for
these
shares
that
were
outstanding,
any
of
them.
now
here
he
had
to
break
it
down
into
two
pieces.
there
have
been
20
shares
issued
in
1951
capitalized
at
only
$1500.
this
i'll
come
to
in
a
moment,
but
the
point
is,
that
even
judge
more
conceded
that
these
20
shares
were
valid
and
that
there
was
consideration
received
for
them.
now
all
judge
moore
could
say
about
the
first
20
was
this.
that
the
man
is
john
malakoff
who
sold
everybody
the
stock
in
this
corporation,
this
man
john
malakoff
had
never
transferred
the
physical
certificates,
these
two
certificates
for
10
shares
each
that
were
originally
issued
in
august
of
1951,
endorsed
over
to
him
in
blank
in
october
of
1951.
he
never
transferred
those
certificates
until
june
of
1953,
when
he
re-endorsed
them
and
assigned
them
to
the
corporation.
so
judge
moore
said,
first
of
all,
that
none
of
these
20
“shares”
came
into
the
possession
or
into
the
hands
of
any
of
the
stock
claimants
or
stockholders,
therefore,
we
can
ignore
them.
now
this
is
just
wrong
under
the
uniform
stock
transfer
act
of
new
york
and
pennsylvania.
it's
the
share
certificates
that
didn't
come
into
anybody's
hand,
not
the
shares
and
there
is
a
difference.
when
malakoff
surrendered
these
shares
in
june
of
1953,
he
couldn't
cut
off
any
prior
rights
in
those
20
shares
that
the
stockholders
had
acquired
two
years
before
or
the
fact
that
they
didn't
get
the
certificates
as
inconclusive.
the
only
other
person
--
the
corporation
received
the
certificates,
and
the
corporation
was
in
no
position
to
cut
off
rights
of
prior
stockholders,
especially
when
it
had
notice.
this
is
on
the
20
shares.
then
on
the
other
180
shares
within
the
authorized
issue,
judge
moore
said,
the
corporation
didn't
receive
consideration,
because
it
didn't
get
the
consideration
directly
from
these
36
people.
every
one
of
them
paid
john
malakoff,
not
a
single
check
went
to
nazareth
fairgrounds,
to
the
corporation.
but
what
the
corporation
got
as
judge
moore
recognized
was
this
piece
of
valuable
real
estate,
which
is
what
all
these
people
are
carrying
on
about.
now
they
have
the
real
estate,
so
judge
moore
said,
the
real
estate
was
not
paid
for
--
he
puts
it
in
two
ways,
let
me
try
to
express
it
this
way.
he
says,
“these
people
didn't
pay
the
corporation
therefore,
the
corporation
didn't
receive
consideration
and
therefore,
all
the
stock
is
void.”
then
he
says,
“however,
we
are
in
a
position
to
award
stock
to
these
people
who
are
entitled
to
it.”
we
have
to
do
it
under
the
pennsylvania
law
and
there
must
be
consideration
for
it.
there
is
consideration,
because
the
corporation
received
the
valuable
piece
of
real
estate.
this
real
estate
was
paid
for
by
john
malakoff.
therefore,
we
can
give
these
people
the
stock
backed
by
the
real
estate
paid
for
by
john
malakoff.
what
judge
moore
has
said
is,
that
the
real
estate
is
consideration
for
new
stock
under
a
plan
of
reorganization,
but
the
same
real
estate
paid
for
by
the
same
man
is
not
consideration
for
the
old
stock
that
he
issued.
well
to
me,
it
makes
no
sense
and
he
is
wrong,
but
even
assuming
that
and
putting
that
aside
that's
the
factual
premise
that
the
stock
is
void
for
lack
of
consideration
or
fact
of
law,
then
we
get
to
these
questions
of
pennsylvania
law.
first
of
all,
the
pennsylvania
law
is
different
from
new
york
and
probably
most
other
states,
but
certainly
from
new
york
in
this
respect.
there
is
a
distinctive
pattern
set
out
by
statute,
which
says
“if
a
subscription
is
unpaid,
if
the
corporation
hasn't
received
stock,
sure
the
stock
is
void
ultimately.”
but
the
statutes
and
the
courts
of
pennsylvania
say,
before
you
void
the
stock,
you
have
to
make
a
call
or
an
assessment
on
these
stockholders
and
give
them,
in
this
case,
the
opportunity
to
pay
that
price
and
until
they
have
been
given
what
amounts
to
a
right
of
redemption,
you
don't
force
it
to
stock.
now
in
new
york
it's
different,
you
make
a
call
there
are
60
days,
if
you
don't
pay
in
that
time,
the
stock
is
forfeited;
even
if
demand
to
pay
90%
of
the
stock
subscription
price
before
that
time,
the
corporation
could
just
forfeit
this.
pennsylvania
is
a
lot
more
solicitous
to
these
minority
stockholders
and
in
pennsylvania;
you
must
have
the
assessment
first.
moreover,
under
pennsylvania
law,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
debtor
--
is
on
the
corporation.
if
they
say
the
stock
hasn't
been
paid
for,
they've
got
to
prove
it.
they
have
to
make
an
assessment
and
say,
you
owe
or
whatever
it
is
a
$100
or
$1000
on
this
stock.
now
there
are
two
alternative
provisions
that
the
corporation
can
follow.
in
this
case,
the
corporation
elected
to
follow
one
and
they
used
the
bankruptcy
court
the
same
as
the
any
other
court.
they
sued
for
a
money
judgment.
they
put
it
in
the
alternative
backwards.
first,
they
asked
for
cancellation.
they
said
in
the
alternative
give
us
the
subscription
price.
it
doesn't
matter,
they
asked
for
the
subscription
price.
they
had
every
opportunity
to
establish
how
much
money
was
due
on
this
stock
and
to
get
a
money
judgment
that
they
asked
for
against
these
stockholders.
and
what
happened
was,
in
the
district
court
judge
sugarman
said,
“no
dice.
i
won't
cancel
any
of
the
stock
and
i
also
won't
assess
any
unpaid
subscription
against
these
people.”
at
this
point,
the
debtor
abandoned
anything
further
where
the
money
judgment
was
concerned.
there
was
no
proof
that
any
of
this
money
was
unpaid
and
the
market
wouldn't
support
whatever
the
numbers
of
shares
was
that
was
outstanding,
this
is
the
second
error.
what
judge
moore
said
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
“we
will
cancel
the
stock.”
he
had
to
begin
by
saying
“all
the
stock
is
void.”
there
is
no
earmarking
of
a
lack
of
consideration,
no
proof
if
there
was
any.
now
the
most
--
to
me,
the
most
vivid
testimony
to
the
fact
that
it's
all
wrong
is
that
both
my
adversaries
have
conceded
that
the
stock
was
valid.
they
don't
know
and
they
don't
even
presume
to
care
how
many
stock
or
shares
of
stock
were
valid
and
how
many
weren't.
all
they
admit
is
that
judge
moore
was
wrong.
at
least
20
shares
of
stock
were
valid,
consideration
was
paid,
their
outstanding
in
somebody
hands.
at
this
point,
i
say
the
debtor
is
out
of
it
and
the
debtor
corporation
has
no
remedy
anymore.
they
have
got
no
right
to
a
money
judgment,
they've
disclaimed
it,
they
never
appealed,
so
the
res
judicata
thing
would
bar
them,
there
is
no
proof,
let
alone
the
burden
of
proof,
there
is
just
no
proof
of
assessment,
they
are
out
of
it.
now
we
have
a
contest
among
36
people
as
to
who
owns
whatever
the
number
of
shares
is.
whether
it's
one,
sorry
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
not
quite,
your
honor.
i
want
all
36
people
in.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
my
difference
with
judge
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yeah,
right.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
that's
right
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
well,
what
judge
sugarman
did
was
to
change
this
index
of
participation.
what
i'm
saying
is,
all
these
people,
each
one
made
a
deal
with
john
malakoff
to
buy
so
many
shares.
a
man
like
weinstein
for
example
said,
“i
buy
7
shares
for
a
$1000
each,
7
out
of
200.”
well
the
over
issue
doesn't
permit
that,
but
i
say
that
what
should
be
done
here
is
that
each
man
has
made
his
contract,
they
vary,
the
prices
vary,
the
terms
vary
and
these
contracts
should
govern
and
the
stock
certificates.
what
judge
sugarman
said
was
we'll
ignore
the
contracts;
we'll
ignore
the
stock
certificates.
what
we'll
do
is
to
use
a
money
index
what
he
called,
i
think
the
net
fair
value
of
the
investment.
now
the
major
difference
here
--
well
there
are
two
differences.
one
is,
the
price
varied
over
a
period
of
two
years
and
there
were
good
reasons
why
the
price
varied.
in
that
sense,
the
people
who
came
in
early
like
one
of
our
people
charles
kanter,
at
the
very
beginning,
who
paid
$4000
for
12
shares,
he
got
what
may
look
like
a
bargain
price.
i
say
this
bargain
is
not
unconscionable
and
he
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
it.
he
paid
$333
a
share,
some
of
the
others
--
most
of
the
others
paid
a
$1000
a
share
a
year
or
two
years
later.
this
man's
money
was
traced
into
the
purchase
price
first
one
in
and
the
second
one
in;
he
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
this
bargain.
judge
sugarman
says
no
we'll
use
the
money
index.
secondly,
you
got
the
problem
of
the
so-called
dividends.
no
money
has
been
traced
here,
that's
what
judge
sugarman
said.
the
court
of
appeals
set
that
finding
aside
and
i
submit
that
judge
moore
is
wrong
there,
but
that's
a
matter
of
federal
law,
your
procedure
rule
52(a).
god
knows
that
there
is
overwhelming
evidence
in
support
of
judge
sugarman's
findings
here.
at
any
rate,
this
man
john
malakoff
out
of
his
own
bank
account
was
paying
20%
“dividend”
every
year.
a
man
like
weinstein
for
example
who
came
in
at
september
of
1951
received
this
20%
on
his
$7000
for
about
20
months,
he
got
back
31%
of
his
money.
other
people
who
came
in
later
got
no
dividends.
the
worst
example
to
me,
is
the
situation
with
kanter,
he
was
getting
dividends
not
on
his
$4000,
but
on
more,
because
malakoff
respected
the
bargain.
so,
he
got
$3800
in
dividend
based
on
$12,000,
although
he
had
only
paid
in
$8800.
judge
sugarman
would
deduct
this
$3800
from
kanter's
interest.
so
not
only
would
he
not
get
the
benefit
of
his
$4000
at
the
very
beginning,
but
the
dividends
on
more
than
his
$8800
would
all
be
deducted.
now
these
dividends
didn't
come
out
of
nazareth,
they
came
out
of
malakoff's
pocket.
this
part
of
it
–-
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
but
your
honor,
all
malakoff
paid
was
about
$60,000
and
what
he
collected
was
well
over
$100,000.
see,
i'll
put
it
to
you
this
way
your
honor,
i
think
the
difficulty
is
that
once
you
start
to
upset
the
benefit
of
a
bargain,
what
these
people
agreed
to
and
what's
on
the
face
of
it
is
really
not
unconscionable,
it
is
impossible
to
find
any
other
rational
basis,
logical
equitable
basis
as
you
can
see
from
the
difference
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court.
what
judge
sugarman
said
was
we
will
deduct
the
dividends
from
the
principle
amount
leaving
in
weinstein's
case,
only
about
$4600
instead
of
$7,000.
so
judge
moore
said,
we'll
deduct
the
dividends,
but
not
from
the
principle.
we
will
treat
it
as
an
obligation
and
attach
a
lien
to
the
stock
so
that
these
people
owe
it
in
the
future.
see,
but
in
the
meantime
they
get
$7,000
--
weinstein
gets
$7,000
worth,
whatever
it
means
and
he
[inaudible]
$7000
instead
of
$4600.
once
you
start
this,
with
all
these
different
patterns,
i
say
it's
hopeless
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
it.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
your
honor
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
well
i
wouldn't
want
to
put
it
that
way.
first
of
all
malakoff
was
not
just
the
ponzi.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
no,
your
honor
the
difference
is
the
ponzi
was
selling
nothing,
and
malakoff
was
selling
something.
these
people
got
what
they
bargained
for.
they
bought
a
piece
of
nazareth
and
they
got
a
piece
of
nazareth.
the
price
is
varied
over
a
period
of
time.
in
effect
i
say
that
john
malakoff
guaranteed
dividends,
of
20%
a
year.
he
misrepresented
that
these
dividends
were
being
paid
by
nazareth
to
him
and
by
him
over
to
these
people.
this
is
no
different
from
what's
going
on
in
new
york
now
with
these
syndicates
where
people
are
guaranteed
dividends
and
they
went
on
paying
them
although
the
back
--
the
real
estate
behind
it
wasn't
there.
you
can
call
it
a
misrepresentation,
but
the
fact
is
that
there
are
two
pieces
to
it
and
the
major
piece
is
that
the
people
got
what
they
bargained
for,
they
got
the
real
estate.
that's
all
that's
left
and
they
have
it
and
the
ponzi
element
of
it
is
paying
the
dividends
out
of
capital
is
a
completely
separate
thing,
and
you
have
to
distinguish
this
from
ponzi.
ponzi
gave
these
people
nothing.
there
was
nothing
there
except
just
the
rotating
capital
and
the
profits
on
it.
that's
not
this
situation.
secondly,
the
difference
in
price
can
be
accounted
for
i
think
in
two
ways;
you
have
to
look
at
the
different
parties.
where
the
cooperation
is
concerned,
if
there
is
anything
unfair
about
issuing
stock
at
different
prices
and
there
isn't
when
you
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
it,
certainly
time
alone
explains
it
then
assess
these
people
the
difference,
but
don't
interfere
with
their
stock
holdings.
charge
them
for
it,
but
don't
deprive
them
of
their
proportionate
share.
secondly,
i
think
this
comes
closest
as
to
what
your
honor
was
saying
mr.
justice
goldberg,
if
the
amount
of
the
money,
the
difference
in
price
is
disturbing,
what
you
are
talking
about
i
think
is
a
fraudulent
transfer
concept.
let
me
put
the
extreme
example,
which
i
think
is
what
you
are
getting
at.
suppose
that
malakoff
goes
to
one
man
in
september
of
1951
and
says
i'll
sell
you
share
of
stock
for
$1,000
a
share,
and
then
he
turns
around
and
the
same
day
he
says
to
somebody
else,
i'll
sell
you
a
share
of
stock,
same
interest
to
nazareth
for
$10.
i
mean
gross
enough
difference
i
--
more
gross
difference
couldn't
be
imagined
beyond
just
giving
it
away.
if
malakoff
committed
no
wrong,
if
there
had
been
no
over
issue
when
he
owned
the
stock,
he
could
probably
have
given
it
away.
if
there
is
a
wrong
the
sort
of
thing
you
are
talking
about
is
a
fraudulent
transfer
concept,
that
people
dealing
with
malakoff
when
malakoff
was
committing
the
fraud,
should
not
get
something
that
caused
other
stockholders
something
else.
now,
if
you
have
a
gross
difference
like
that,
i
suppose
you
can
say,
and
there
is
a
question
of
fact
involved
here
that
any
man
who
takes
this
share
of
stock
for
$10
when
he
knows
that
the
market
price
is
$1,000
and
has
reason
to
believe
that
malakoff
is
committing
a
fraud,
you
ought
to
take
that
share
of
stock
away
from
him.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yeah,
sir.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes
in
part,
yes.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
six
of
these
36
--
the
shares
are
six
of
the
36
were
canceled,
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
your
honor
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
oh
no,
your
honor
i
know
this
court
would
never
have
granted
the
certiorari
to
review
when
an
erroneous
interpretation
of
pennsylvania
law
by
a
federal
court.
but
it
goes
beyond
that
because
you
see
this
is
the
first
step,
the
second
step
is
what
judge
moore
did
affirmatively
or
what
he
said
he
was
doing.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
that's
right
and
the
second
point
just
so
that
we
are
clear
is
that
what
he
did
apply,
this
sort
of
purchase
money
resulting
trust
just
can't
stand
up
either.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
oh
well
i
--your
honor
i
love
you
to
do
it,
i
don't
know.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
sir?
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes
the
question
presented
to
the
court
is
the
proper
choice
of
law,
and
if
you
agree
with
me
that
the
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes
assuming
that
you
find
that
it's
too
much
of
a
mess
to
decide
yourself.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
alright.
well
let
me
turn
to
the
other
case
then
your
honor.
the
other
one
number
26362
involves
the
administration
of
the
estate
and
the
events
here
all
occurred
during
the
reorganization
proceeding.
now
here
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
special
body
of
federal
law
that
governs
fiduciary
conduct
in
a
chapter
x
proceeding.
and
ultimately
what
petitioners
contend
is
that
judge
moore
--
judge
friendly's
opinion
in
this
case
is
in
a
sense
to
the
adverse
that
here
there
was
a
federal
interest
and
the
special
body
of
federal
law
that
was
ignored
and
again
what
judge
friendly
--
what
the
court
did
through
judge
friendly
was
to
apply
a
sort
of
general
equity
or
federal
common
law
without
paying
proper
attention
to
the
special
body
of
law
in
two
sections
of
chapter
x
and
the
case
law
of
this
court,
both
in
chapter
x
cases
and
in
other
federal
equity
receivership
cases.
sir?
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
right
and
this
is
much
closer
to
a
matter
a
statutory
interpretation,
but
certainly
within
this
court's
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
i
understand.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
well,
your
honor,
i
understand
that
general
principle,
but
let
me
put
my
understanding
or
misunderstanding
to
you
that
your
find
cases,
for
example
in
the
tax
lien
case
where
you
run
into
the
problem
of
what
the
state
law
is
as
to
who
owns
property
and
so
on,
which
is
part
of
what
i
relied
on
here.
and
to
pick
two
companion
cases,
when
you
have
the
durham
lumber
and
the
aquilino
case
the
aquilino
case
you
sent
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
so
new
york
could
tell
you
what
their
law
was.
but
in
the
durham
lumber
case
you
said
we
are
willing
to
accept
what
the
lower
courts
have
said
and
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
right,
that's
right
sir.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
i
don't
remember
sir,
i
just
don't.
but
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
oh
no
question
about
that,
i
just
raised
it
and
i
went
all
the
way
on
this,
partly
in
the
hope
that
it
would
be
understood
better
and
partly
because
of
my
hope
that
maybe
the
court
would
decide
it,
because
occasionally
the
court
has
decided
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
it
applied
what
i
call
the
sort
of
general
equity
your
honor,
which
to
me
to
use
a
term
i
don't
mean
to
be
disrespectful
was
no
law.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
not
that
simply
your
honor,
judge
moore
began
as
i
say
by
quoting
the
pennsylvania
constitution.
and
then
what
he
did
was
two-fold,
first
of
all
that
part
of
it
is
error
and
what
you
have
is
a
disregard
and
then
he
went
on
to
award
an
affirmative
remedy
with
no
further
reference
to
the
state
law
as
though
the
affirmative
remedy
or
the
decision
of
the
federal
court
could
be
made
with
no
reference
to
state
law.
now
what
i'm
saying
is
that
half
of
what
he
did
may
involve
by
his
own
opinion
a
misinterpretation
of
state
law,
but
the
other
half,
the
decree,
the
affirmative
remedy
that
the
court
of
appeals
ordered
was
done
in
terms
of
what
judge
moore
said
himself
on
two
occasions
was
a
matter
of
“doing
equity”
and
nothing
else.
he
didn't
even
purport
to
look
to
any
state
law
as
to
who
owned
this
stock.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
your
honor,
if
you
can
show
me
--
if
anyone
can
show
me
any
federal
ground
for
excluding
these
people,
i'm
through.
what
i
say
is
there
isn't
any
federal
ground.
you
don't
have
an
insolvency
which
is
the
usual
reason
for
throwing
out
a
stockholder
with
valid
stock,
that
there
is
no
equity
left
for
them.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
that
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
but
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
i'm
objecting
to.
i
don't
mean
any
offense,
i
know
that
these
three
men
have
sat
on
the
court
of
appeals
are
decent,
fair,
intelligent
men,
i
don't
want
their
notions
of
fairness.
i
want
the
law
applied,
if
this
were
diversity
court,
these
judges
would
have
said,
we
look
first
to
the
law
of
so
and
so.
sir?
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
well
that's
the
question
presented
to
your
honor,
that
shouldn't
this
rules
of
decision
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
sir?
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
that's
right.
but,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
weinstein
reserved
the
question
and
had
to
reserve
the
question
because
there
was
a
federal
interest
there
and
that's
how
the
case
was
decided.
the
majority
disagreed
with
mr.
justice
frankfurter
who
said,
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
federal
law,
because
as
i
read
the
state
law,
compound
interest
would
not
be
permitted
either
in
this
case.
but
the
majority
said,
no,
we
will
treat
this
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
and
the
federal
law
bars
compound
interest
in
this
situation.
now
you
don't
have
that
question
of
federal
law
here
and
that's
why
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression
and
that
weinstein
doesn't
decide
it.
you've
got
reservation
throughout
all
of
these
cases.
in
the
mckenzie
case
you
get
these
reservations,
because
there
you
are
dealing
with
section
68
on
preferences,
where
part
of
it
is
a
matter
of
bankruptcy
statutes
and
policy
and
part
is
a
direct
reference
to
state
law.
you
don't
have
that
here
either.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
want
to
turn
back
to
this
other
case
on
compensation
to
fiduciaries
and
their
removal
from
office.
now
in
this
case
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
the
26362
your
honor,
which
involves
the
administration.
now
in
this
case
unlike
the
other
one,
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
substantial
dispute
about
the
facts.
there
are
two
operative
facts,
which
are
important.
one
is,
i
better
go
back
for
a
moment,
the
debtor
was
continued
in
possession
as
i
noted
under
his
former
management
and
as
your
honors
may
note,
at
the
very
outset,
which
i
have
is
an
order,
this
ex
parte
order
that
was
signed
in
september
of
1953,
which
stated
that
the
debtor
by
arnold
a.
weinstein
and
jerome
fried,
be
authorized,
directed
and
empowered
to
operate
the
business
and
manage
the
property
of
the
debtor.
now
you
have
a
situation
where
no
trustee
is
appointed
and
these
two
people,
the
president
and
the
general
manager
are
de
facto
trustees
and
even
the
order
sets
it
up
as
two
of
them
equally
operating
this
business,
managing
the
property.
now
two
things
happened,
one
is,
in
the
course
of
this
reorganization
these
people
bought
stock
of
nazareth.
weinstein
bought
stock
not
only
for
himself,
but
also
for
his
sister
and
for
fried.
they
both
bought
stock
for
their
own
accounts
and
for
others
during
the
reorganization.
now,
this
triggers
at
least
this
specific
statute
section
249
of
chapter
x,
which
says,
in
sweeping
and
i
submit
quite
clear
terms,
no
compensation
shall
be
allowed
to
any
person
acting
in
a
fiduciary
capacity
during
the
reorganization
and
while
so
acting
buys
or
sells
any
stock
or
claims
that
are
being
reorganized.
now
this
is
what
friendly's
opinion
addressed
itself
to.
the
district
judge
had
said,
yes,
it
does
apply.
these
people
are
barred
from
compensation.
judge
friendly
reversed
his
opinion
construe
section
249
and
says,
no,
it
doesn't.
now,
here
you
have
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
i
think
that
the
crux
of
this
problem
is
that
before
you
even
get
to
the
strict
reading
of
the
statute,
which
is
quite
clear
in
terms,
i
think
the
problem
is
that
judge
friendly
begins
by
assuming
that
a
corporation
in
reorganization
is
the
same
as
any
other
corporation.
and
he
says
that
normally
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
persons
who
are
officers
of
any
corporation,
nothing
wrong
with
them
buying
the
stock.
so
if
they
buy
stock,
or
sell
stock,
or
claims,
you
began
with
the
assumption
there's
nothing
wrong
and
then
wants
a
penal
sort
of
interpretation
of
anything
that
interferes
with
that.
now
the
major
problem
is
i
think
we
have
to
begin
by
recognizing
that
it's
normal
for
a
corporation
to
be
in
a
chapter
x
proceeding.
this
receivership
is
most
abnormal
and
there's
a
special
body
of
law
that
applies
to
this,
it's
partly
statutory
and
partly
decisional.
and
i
submit
that
it's
a
fiction
and
not
a
norm
to
consider
what
would
happen
outside
in
a
federal
equity
receivership
court
in
terms
of
the
obligations
of
these
people.
now,
beyond
–
sir?
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
that's
quite
true,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so
at
all,
i
hope
not.
what
i'm
talking
about,
in
the
other
case
is
the
question
of
claims
or
whatever
rights
vested
before
the
reorganization,
that's
what
was
being
adjudicated.
what
these
people
did
was
to
throw
this
corporation,
they
did
it
themselves.
they
threw
into
reorganization
and
once
it's
in
court,
the
question
of
their
conduct
in
court
is
a
special
federal
matter.
now
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
matters
that
are
being
adjudicated
except
to
the
extent
that
curiously
the
very
stock
and
issue
that
they
bought
is
the
stock
that
is
an
issue
in
the
other
cases
and
which
is
clouded
by
their
particular
objections
and
appeals
in
this
case.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
weinstein
bought
only
a
fraction
of
the
share
for
himself.
fried
bought
a
substantial
number
of
shares
because
weinstein
had
bought
some
shares
for
his
sister
and
for
fried.
the
way
statute
249
reads
and
the
way
it's
been
interpreted
for
over
20
years
in
every
circuit
that's
received
the
249
case,
the
first,
second,
third,
fourth,
sixth
and
seventh,
without
question,
they've
all
interpreted
the
statute
to
mean
that
buying
or
selling
any
number
or
a
fraction
that
makes
no
difference
for
your
own
account
is
sufficient.
that
when
congress
said
it
didn't
want
any
of
this
trading,
congress
meant
what
it
said,
and
there's
a
history
behind
this.
there
were
lot
of
abuses
before
the
chandler
act
that
they
were
trying
to
put
an
end
to.
and
they
put
this
in
terms
of
a
specific
type
of
conduct.
now,
the
other
statute
i
relied
on,
that
judge
friendly
didn't
even
cite
or
pay
or
mention,
and
the
other
cases
involved
primarily
it
is
woods
versus
city
national
bank
is
a
broader
thing.
and
there,
the
statute
has
its
history
and
has
been
interpreted.
there
the
statute
prohibits,
the
statute
denies
compensation
for
any
actual
conflict
of
interests.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
221
sub
4,
your
honor
and
under
that
statute
and
i
submit
that
the
very
same
conduct
would
be
prohibited
and
that
the
remedy
would
be
this
denial
of
compensation
and
with
it
removal
from
office,
but
in
this
case,
probably
you
can
begin
with
section
249
because
it's
easiest.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
your
honor
that's
what
judge
friendly
said
and
i'm
willing
to
grant
that's
normally
the
case
outside
reorganization.
i
have
two
problems
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
why
there
are
two
conflicts,
one
involves
their
relationship
to
the
corporation
and
the
other
involves
their
relationship
to
other
stockholders.
these
people
are
here
suing
for
a
class
of
stockholders,
not
the
entire
class.
this
is
a
representative
action
on
their
part
in
trying
to
sustain
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
earlier
in
trying
to
get
the
court
of
appeals
to
change
what
the
district
court
did.
now
under
such
cases
as
young
versus
higbee,
which
mr.
justice
black
--
where
mr.
justice
black
wrote
the
opinion,
they
are
acting
as
representatives
regardless
of
their
being
officers.
here
they
are
suing
individually
as
stockholders.
so
there's
your
first
question
as
to
conflict
of
interest
with
these
various
people
where
they
are
buying
and
selling
for
themselves,
are
only
part
of
the
class.
sir?
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
they
only
bought,
or
to
the
extent
that
you
can
buy
and
sell,
weinstein
would
buy
--
advance
his
own
money
and
two
weeks
later
return
the
stockholder
over
to
fried
and
get
reimbursed.
now
whether
you
call
this
a
purchase
and
sale
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yeah.
now
the
other
problem
is
a
specific
pennsylvania
statute,
actually
there
are
three.
there
is
a
pennsylvania
statute
that
says,
where
you
have
an
over
issue
of
stock.
the
corporation
may
have
to
--
maybe
required
to
buy
stock
in
the
market
and
to
give
it
to
the
innocent
parties
holding
the
over
issue
in
order
to
avoid
their
losing
the
stock.
in
that
sense
here
maybe
this
corporation
had
an
interest.
now
the
corporation
of
which
they
were
president
and
general
manager,
the
corporation
may
have
had
an
interest
in
buying
this
stock,
to
get
rid
of
this
over
issue
and
to
put
an
end
to
this
lawsuit.
they
didn't
do
that.
now
it's
this
kind
of
conflict
of
interest
which
is
a
problem.
thirdly
there
is
the
fact
that
you've
got
a
relationship
where
weinstein
and
fried
are
suing
individually
as
stockholders
and
they
bring
the
debtor
in
and
they
are
using
the
debtor
that
they
control
to
take
a
certain
position
in
this
case
where
the
debtor
has
no
interest.
and
this
is
your
third
problem
that
presents
certain
conflicts
of
interest,
their
use
of
debtor
where
the
only
benefit
accrues
to
them
individually
as
to
the
number
of
shares
or
a
proportion
of
shares
they
would
hold,
and
where
they
disclaim
the
only
remedy
the
corporation
would
have,
a
money
judgment
on
the
stock
for
the
unpaid
subscriptions.
now
it's
my
position
that
they
have
these
various
conflicts
of
interest
and
that
you
have
the
special
body
of
federal
law
that
just
denies
compensation
and
would
remove
them,
and
should
remove
them.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
it
doesn't
speak
in
those
terms
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
oh.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
not
quite
your
honor,
there
is
a
history
on
that
odd
provision.
it's
a
disjunctive
thing.
it
goes
back
to
the
legislative
history.
that
last
clause
which
makes
the
reference
to
the
court
approving
a
sale
refers
to
an
involuntary
sale.
i
shouldn't
use
the
word
sale,
it
refers
to
an
involuntary
transfer,
primarily
the
situation
where
a
man
dies
and
by
operation
of
law
his
stock
or
his
claims,
bonds,
securities,
lined
or
passing
through
an
estate,
the
decedent's
estate
into
somebody
else's
hand.
you
also
have
possibly
the
situation
where
a
person
pledges
stock
and
then
there
is
an
involuntary
foreclosure
of
the
stock.
this
problem
was
last
presented
in
the
second
circuit,
in
the
last
opinion
before
nazareth,
the
surface
transportation
case
or
the
third
avenue,
where
they'd
have
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
situation
of
the
broker
foreclosing
on
a
margin
call
and
the
stockholder
individually
just
voluntarily
selling
it.
at
any
rate
the
only
time
that
comes
into
play
is
when
it's
involuntary,
not
when
you
have
a
voluntary
purchase
or
a
sale.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
oh
no,
no.
actually
the
very
first
case,
the
otis
in
1940
in
the
first
circuit,
let
me
see
if
i
can
find
it,
otis
&
company
versus
insurance
building,
it's
cited
at
the
page
144
of
petitioners
brief
your
honor.
otis
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes
and
i
think
you'll
find
in
that
case
the
quotation
of
the
legislative
history
which
shows
why
you
have
that
odd
wording.
in
addition
your
honor
the
second
circuit
case
in
1959
the
surface
--
you
find
--
surface
transit
which
is
cited
at
page
144
also,
you'll
find
that
case
discusses
exactly
the
same
problem
of
just
what
that
last
clause
means
in
the
limited
area
of
court
approval
of
the
sale.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
that's
right.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
quite
true
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
well,
with
two
qualifications.
first
of
all,
you
can
see
from
the
record,
of
course
this
would
depend
on
what
happens
on
the
stock
claims,
you
know
what
interest
there
is
and
what
profit
there
is
in
the
stock.
you
have
the
two
companion
cases.
the
other
is
that
the
other
question
that
the
court
never
reached
where
the
other
grounds
that
were
cited,
this
business
about
the
rent
diversions
that
were
committed
by
weinstein
and
fried,
you
had
a
situation
where
judge
sugarman
said,
all
i'm
going
to
consider
is
just
the
purchase
of
stock
and
i
will
consider
that
only
under
section
249.
so
he
said,
i
don't
have
to
consider
anything
else
except
just
these
bare
facts
that
trigger
the
section,
they
bought
the
stock
while
they
were
fiduciaries
of
the
debtor.
and
thereafter
249
comes
into
play.
now
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
i
would
say
no
your
honor,
but
this
was
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
white,
that
if
you're
looking
to
get
some
idea
of
profit
or
motive,
you
can
see
some
of
it
from
the
companion
case.
i
submit
that
the
reason
that
the
statue
is
absolute
is
that
congress
and
this
court
in
the
past
don't
want
this
sort
of
inquiry.
they
want
a
certain
sort
of
conduct
and
they
don't
want
to
have
to
get
involved
in
these
questions
of
profit
and
motives
and
whatnot,
but
if
you're
looking
for
it,
i
think
it's
quite
transparent
and
vivid
in
this
case.
now
the
other
question
is
the
race
track
matter;
there
judge
sugarman
said
i'll
put
this
off
this
until
we
have
the
question
of
the
accounting
of
the
rents,
which
came
much
later
and
is
still
pending.
when
it
got
to
the
circuit,
judge
friendly
didn't
even
mention
it.
i
mean
his
approach
to
this
apparently
was
since
judge
sugarman
didn't
go
any
further
than
this,
neither
would
he,
but
the
difficulty
is
that
not
only
didn't
the
circuit
consider
it,
but
there
was
a
refusal
of
remand
so
that
it
never
got
considered.
now
this
again
remains
to
be
decided
to
address
myself,
i
think
to
what
your
honor
was
referring
to
as
to
the
scope
of
this
court's
review,
these
facts
are
for
the
most
part
are
undisputed
as
to
what
these
people
did.
it's
a
question
of
the
legal
meaning
of
it.
i'm
talking
about
the
legal
consequences
only
for
purposes
of
compensation
and
continuing
service,
which
is
not
the
same
as
the
accounting
of
the
rents
and
for
those
purposes
i
submit
if
you
had
to
and
i
hope
you
never
have
to
get
to
it,
if
you
had
to
get
to
that
you
could
decide
it
on
the
merits.
but
if
you
should
agree
with
judge
friendly,
you
still
have
the
rest
of
this,
this
rent
diversion
problem,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
just
drop
it
as
judge
friendly
did.
thank
you.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes
sir.
let
me
address
myself
first,
to
mr.
justice
black
and
apologize
for
failure
to
make
--
obviously
a
failure
to
make
a
fair
opening
in
explaining
the
situation
and
then
specifically
to
mr.
justice
brennan.
we
did
take
a
cross
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
district
court's
denial
of
that
portion
of
our
petition
asking
for
recoupment
and
restitution.
of
course
it
was
never
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
question
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
on
that
aspect
of
the
case
was
addressed
to
denial
of
compensation,
and
what
was
spelled
out
under
that
was
it
meant
past
and
future
and
in
that
sense,
the
matter
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
before
your
honors.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
yes.
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
in
a
word,
yes.
now,
your
honor,
i
should
qualify
one
thing,
section
249
--
mr.
melvin
lloyd
robbins
okay.
your
honor
let
me
--
if
the
court
please
let
me
say
just
one
or
two
things
about
what
mr.
rosen
had
said
on
the
stock
claims.
first
of
all,
mr.
rosen
said
something
about
the
widowers.
this
is
an
interesting
plea,
because
one
of
these
widowers
is
mr.
fried,
his
claim
was
allowed
for
$2,000,
and
as
the
record
will
show,
this
is
one
of
the
points
that's
been
raised
about
the
arbitrary
standard
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
fried's
$2,000
was
a
credit
for
a
profit
on
another
deal
he
had
with
malakoff,
for
whom
he
had
worked
certainly
since
1951.
his
claim
was
allowed
whereas
other
claims
were
disallowed.
you
have
both
an
arbitrariness
in
the
application
of
this
standard
and
a
setting
aside
of
facts
by
the
district
court.
now,
what
mr.
rosen
has
been
saying
to
your
honors
is
that
everything
he
has
referred
to
is
in
the
record,
but
what
is
in
the
record,
in
the
sense
that
you've
got
a
record
of
about
12,000
pages.
there
is
in
utter
disregard
of
the
findings
and
if
you'd
pay
–
if
you
note
this
distinction
between
this
massive
evidence
in
the
record
and
the
findings,
i
think,
your
honors
will
find
that
many
of
mr.
rosen's
statements
are
simply
unsupported
by
findings.
finally,
this
whole
theory
hangs
on
a
concept
of
investors
which
is
important
i
think
in
terms
of
this
notion
of
fairness.
what
it
reduces
to
is
judge
morris
saying
pretty
much,
if
a
man
wants
to
invest
in
a
deal,
a
corporation
or
a
venture,
the
only
way
he
can
do
it
is
to
make
a
direct
investment
say
to
the
corporation
like
at&t
or
u.s.
steel.
if
he
pays
the
money
to
the
corporation,
then
he
gets
an
interest,
he
intends
to
invest,
but
if
he
pays
the
money
to
a
broker
or
an
underwriter
or
another
stockholder
for
that
at&t
stock,
then
he
does
not
intend
to
invest
and
i
submit
that
there
just
isn't
any
sense
to
this.
on
top
of
which,
what
you
have
is
the
fact
that
everyone
of
these
36
paid
his
money
to
malakoff,
and
the
district
court
found
there's
an
implicit
finding
of
intention
there,
that
everyone
of
these
36
without
distinction
intended
to
buy
what
malakoff
himself
had
to
sell.
and
that
finding
is
based
on
the
sort
of
evidence
that
i've
copied
at
pages
23
and
24
of
the
brief.
weinstein
himself
testified
to
on
the
road
and
what
he
put
into
a
proof
of
claim,
he
drafted
this
key
letter
--
letter
received
that
most
of
the
stockholders
received
and
used
in
their
relationship
with
malakoff.
finally
–
i'll
stop
there.
thank
you.
