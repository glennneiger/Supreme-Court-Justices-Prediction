mr.
harold
harper
may
it
please
the
court.
i
understood
that
i
was
to
have
half
an
hour
and
i'm
prepared
to
use
that
half
an
hour.
mr.
harold
harper
give
me
only
20
minutes
of
an
expected
30
minutes
and
i
--
mr.
harold
harper
well,
i
appreciate
it.
my
colleague
continued
because
of
the
questioning
of
the
court.
i
will
still
try
to
be
as
brief
as
i
can.
i
want
to
talk
first
about
249.
my
client
jerome
fried
on
the
4th
of
january
1960
found
himself
fired.
the
court
did
that
from
the
bench
in
the
course
of
colloquy.
the
only
order
that
was
made
at
that
time
was
the
court's
simple
direction
that
he
was
fired
and
fried
asked
the
court
--
mr.
harold
harper
that
he
was
fired
from
his
job
as
manager
of
the
nazareth
property
at
nazareth
pennsylvania.
and
he
asked
the
court,
“am
i
fired
entirely,
because
of
section
249?”
and
the
court
said,
“yes”.
we
don't
have
to
leave
it
to
that
colloquy.
if
we
go
to
the
court's
findings,
which
we
got
to
a
month
or
two
later,
the
court
there
said
that
he
had
severed
free
and
weinstein
from
their
positions
respectively
as
manager
and
as
president.
mr.
harold
harper
that
is
on
page
249
of
the
record
if
the
court
pleases.
he
says
that
he
has
granted
this
application
and
it
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
solely
and
you'll
notice
the
court
underscores
the
word
solely,
solely
because,
they
had
violated
section
249
of
the
bankruptcy
act
by
trading
in
the
debtors
stock
and
upon
no
other
basis.
at
another
point
in
these
same
findings,
he
repeats
that
same
language
and
again,
he
underlines
the
word
solely.
so
that
there
can
be
no
question
that
the
court
was
not
exercising
any
discretion
or
attempting
to
exercise
any
discretion
or
considering
any
other
matter
except
whether
conditions
of
section
249
mandated
fried's
discharge
and
weinstein's
removal
from
the
active
conduct
of
the
business.
now,
i
take
it
to
be
ordinary
of
public
law
that
if
a
court
has
decided
to
point
a
law
below
erroneously
that
the
mere
fact
that
he
might
have
reached
the
same
result
in
an
exercise
of
discretion
will
not
justify
affirming
him.
and
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
because
they
found
that
that
section
249
did
not
apply
to
these
two
individuals.
now,
may
i
say
that
while
--
mr.
harold
harper
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
harold
harper
they
did
not
find
--
they
found
that
it
did
not
apply,
because
they
were
not
the
persons
who
were
intended
by
that
statute.
in
other
words,
that
an
officer
of
a
debtor
in
possession
or
a
manager
active
in
the
field
as
my
client
fried
was,
were
not
people
who
are
contemplated
by
section
249.
mr.
harold
harper
well,
sir
why
i
should
say
is
this.
section
249
--
well,
first
fried
was
--
fried's
duties
as
manager
out
in
the
field
are
roughly
to
collect
rents,
to
see
to
the
joint
advertising,
look
after
the
disposal
of
garbage,
to
negotiate
the
leases
of
stalls,
although,
he
had
no
authority
to
conclude
the
leases
and
no
authority
to
sign
checks.
weinstein,
while
he
had
more
authority
as
president
of
the
debtor
in
possession
was
there
not
as
a
matter
of
merely
being
employed
as
fried
was,
but
as
being
appointed
under
section
191
of
the
bankruptcy
act
with
his
salary
of
$50
a
week
being
fixed
by
the
court.
now,
your
honor
asks
why
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
section
249
does
not
apply
to
them.
my
answer
involves
almost
all
that
i
intended
to
say
upon
this
argument.
mr.
harold
harper
they
were
fired
in
the
january
4th
1960,
yes.
mr.
harold
harper
the
court
of
appeals
granted
a
stay.
the
district
court
purposely
--
mr.
harold
harper
the
district
court
stay
--
let
them
stay
in
their
jobs,
but
without
compensation,
it
directed
that
the
compensation
be
impounded
and
it
was
--
mr.
harold
harper
and
it
was
impounded
upon
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
why
the
money
was
refunded.
mr.
harold
harper
and
are
still
engaged
--
mr.
harold
harper
well
there's
a
great
deal
of
more
at
stake,
that's
what
i
should
say
in
this
--
mr.
harold
harper
one
thing
that
the
petitioners
asked
for
and
they
didn't
get
was
a
recoupment
of
all
of
the
moneys
that
these
men
had
earned
in
the
--
well
it's
now
nine
years,
seven
years
then,
that
this
case
had
been
going
through
the
this
reorganization
proceeding.
roughly
if
you
took
the
salary
at
about
$10,000
a
year
that
means
that
about
--
somewhere
between
$6,000
and
$7,000
would
have
been
involved
in
that
time,
somewhere
around
$9,000
or
$10,000,
assuming
that
this
court
should
decree
recoupment.
mr.
harold
harper
if
the
court
pleases,
yes.
mr.
harold
harper
so
there
is
no
money
impounded
now?
mr.
harold
harper
pursuant
to
the
result
achieved
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
harold
harper
if
you
were
to
hold
not
only
that
the
court
below
was
right
in
removing
or
severing
them
from
the
operation,
but
if
you
were
to
also
hold
that
the
court
should
have
granted
a
recoupment
which
it
did
not
then
you
would
have
the
--
mr.
harold
harper
well
i
don't
think
that
was
a
law
until
your
honor
expressed
it,
i
don't
think
that
was
the
law
that
they
were
required
to
be
removed
by
249
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
argue
sir.
mr.
harold
harper
i
think
so,
and
i
think
logically
you
should.
i
think
logically
that
goes
along.
mr.
harold
harper
now
if
the
court
pleases
--
mr.
harold
harper
i
say
that
because
certainly
fried
was
not
a
representative
of
anybody,
he
didn't
represent
anybody.
mr.
harold
harper
[inaudible]
mr.
harold
harper
no
the
court
didn't
report
to
continue.
mr.
harold
harper
the
petitioner
asked
for
that
and
the
court's
order
was
that
if
the
petition
was
granted,
my
contention
is
that,
that
didn't
make
fried
a
de
facto
trustee,
to
use
the
language
here,
that
fried
continued
to
be
what
he
was
before
the
petition
for
reorganization
was
filed.
that
he
continued
to
be
a
manager
out
there
in
the;
field
collecting
the
rents,
removing
the
garbage,
doing
the
other
things
which
--
mr.
harold
harper
and
accountable
to
weinstein
as
president
of
the
cooperation,
right.
mr.
harold
harper
and
in
turn
accountable
of
the
court.
mr.
harold
harper
well
i
assume
that
if
your
honor
is
reaching
the
word
fiduciary,
which
is
the
only
word
that
you
can
play
with
there.
mr.
harold
harper
i
should
say
so.
and
i
could
also
say
perhaps
that
a
person
whose
duty
it
was
to
sweep
out
these
stalls
was
also
working
under
the
cost
direction,
the
district
court
was
in
command
of
everything.
mr.
harold
harper
i
don't
hear
your
honor's
characterization
but
--
mr.
harold
harper
i
can
see
that
fried
had
a
responsible
position.
there
is
no
doubt
of
that,
but
the
question
is,
is
he
to
be
regarded
as
an
applicant
under
section
249.
now
if
i
may
run
over
very
quickly
the
reasons
why
249
do
not
apply.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
a
statue
for
strict
construction,
there
can't
be
any
question
about
that.
it's
a
severe
penalty.
it's
a
penalty
because
it
doesn't
deprive
a
man
of
his
profits
on
his
shares
as
you
do
under
section
16(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
you
go
to
an
entirely
different
field
and
you
take
from
him
the
money
that
he
has
earned,
the
allowance
to
which
he
is
entitled,
i'm
talking
now
to
a
person
who
does
come
under
the
act
not
about
one
who
doesn't,
you
are
entitled
a
lawyer,
you
deprive
the
lawyer
of
his
fees
and
not
only
of
his
fees,
but
of
his
disbursements.
but
here
in
the
case
that
is
cited
in
my
adversary's
reply
brief
decided
only
october
by
this
sixth
circuit,
they
took
committee
men
there
and
they
denied
them
recoupment
of
expenses
of
$20,000,
they
were
fined
$20,000.
mr.
harold
harper
i
take
it
that
to
correct
me
or
was
the
purpose
for
the
enactment
of
any
penal
statutes,
but
my
point
is
that
this
is
a
penal
statute
and
a
very
severe
one
and
therefore,
one
that
calls
for
strict
constructions
and
applying
strict
instructions,
if
i
may,
you
have
these
differentiations.
249
is
found
in
article
13
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
every
one
of
those
sections
in
article
13
has
to
do
with
allowances,
not
one
of
them
says
anything
about
salary
or
wages.
under
section
--
obviously,
the
compensation
and
the
reimbursement
that
is
not
to
be
allowed
under
249
must
be.
the
allowances
that
are
permitted
in
the
earlier
sections
and
if
you
go
to
section
247,
you
will
find
that
the
court
cannot
grant
an
allowance
without
a
hearing
and
without
notice
being
given
to
the
stockholders,
everybody
in
interest,
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
so
forth.
now
come
to
a
man
who
is
on
a
salary,
be
he
a
manager
or
be
he
an
officer.
mr.
harold
harper
pardon
me?
mr.
harold
harper
yes,
yes
mr.
weinstein
was
the
president
of
the
company,
but
take
even
the
president
on
his
salary.
before
he
gets
this
$50
a
week,
is
he
required
every
week
to
file
the
statement
that
is
required
by
249
that
he
hasn't
traded
and
to
file
it
not
with
his
employer,
but
with
the
court?
mr.
harold
harper
well
--
mr.
harold
harper
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
think
so
and
since
i
see
my
time
has
expired
and
--
mr.
harold
harper
well,
i
say
this,
that
weinstein
no
more
than
fried
were
included
in
any
of
these
sections
in
article
xiii.
i
say
that
article
--
that
section
249
applies
only
to
the
persons
to
whom
an
allowance
maybe
granted
under
article
xiii.
i
say
it
applies
only
to
the
people
that
we
might
characterize
as
the
reorganization
crew,
the
people
who
come
there
and
here
today
and
gone
tomorrow.
it
does
not
apply
for
the
man
who
is
--
the
people
who
are
connected
with
the
corporation
all
the
way
through.
and
i
say
--
mr.
harold
harper
and
then
the
nature
of
--
mr.
harold
harper
well,
i
hope
i
won't
offend
if
answer
that
question
with
a
question.
mr.
harold
harper
i
might
answer
the
question
with
a
question.
do
you
suppose
that
in
the
case
of
united
states
steel
corporation,
that
all
of
the
managers
of
the
various
divisions,
at
the
various
plants,
would
have
to
file
with
the
court
each
week
before
they
drew
the
pay,
the
statement
required
by
section
249?
now
it
maybe
that
congress
ought
to
pass
a
law
which
would
include
the
officers
in
--
when
you
include
the
officers
within
the
prohibition,
the
question
here
before
this
court
is,
have
they
done
it?
and
i
say
they
haven't
done
it
in
view
of
the
location
of
the
section
and
in
view
of
the
differences
between
persons
paid
on
a
salary
and
the
persons
who
have
to
look
to
the
court
for
allowance
as
a
matter
of
grace
to
show
that
they've
benefited
the
estate.
thank
you.
