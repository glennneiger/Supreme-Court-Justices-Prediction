mr.
alex
l.
rosen
chief
judge
warren,
honorable
sirs.
first
your
honors
i
would
like
to
lay
to
rest
a
preliminary
statement
that
was
made
to
this
court
perhaps
unintentionally
by
the
petitioner.
this
debtor
corporation
was
insolvent
from
its
inception
until
its
demise.
and
all
your
honors
will
have
to
do,
except
that
i
have
a
shortage
of
time
is
to
look
at
volume
2,
folio
10561,
page
540
and
you
will
note
that
the
liabilities
exceeded
the
assets.
they
were
technically
insolvent.
they
were
equitably
insolvent
in
1951.
the
only
surplus
they
had
was
$1500,
their
quick
assets.
it
was
only
one
thousand
some
odd
dollars
and
their
quick
liabilities
was
four
thousand
some
odd
dollars.
in
1953,
they
were
equitably
insolvent.
there
were
judgments
by
mr.
margolis
and
mr.
livings
and
that
was
the
reason
that
chapter
x
reorganization
was
filed.
in
addition,
i
should
bring
to
your
honor's
attention
--
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
your
honor
â€“-
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
there
were
no
findings
by
anyone
your
honor,
but
they
are
in
the
very
exhibits
that
are
attached,
part
of
this
very
record.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
folio
10561,
10563.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
that's
right.
and
then,
you
have
folio
10564,
you
have
all
these
statements
that
are
attached
right
to
this
part
of
this
record,
which
show
unequivocally
technical
and
equitable
insolvency.
i
should
also
advise
this
court
that
there
was
adjudication
here
to
the
extent
of
a
petition
in
reorganization
filed.
there
has
been
no
appeal
from
that
and
under
chapter
x
this
corporation
was
bankrupt
and
in
the
reorganization.
now,
there
was
no
appeal
from
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
contested
by
mr.
margolis.
again,
i
say
the
petitioner
probably
forgot
about
it.
i
do
think
that
even
though
i
have
short
time
i
should
tell
this
court
a
little
bit
about
the
facts,
which
have
not
properly
been
explained
to
this
court.
real
estate
syndication
and
promotion
your
honor
has
become
big
business
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
great
number
of
bankruptcy
cases
now
are
pending
involving
real
estate
promotion
and
syndication,
bankruptcies.
this
case
will
act
as
precedence
in
that
particular
field
as
far
as
modern
times
are
concerned.
unfortunately,
the
syndicators
and
promoters
of
today
take
the
public's
money
and
they
represent
that
capacity
individually
in
escrow
and
for
a
specific
investment
in
specific
parcels
of
property.
in
other
words,
a
syndicator
may
have
four
or
five
parcels
that
he
is
selling
to
the
public.
he
will
come
to
mr.
a
and
say
to
mr.
a
here
is
parcel,
it
is
a
good
parcel,
buy
it
at
interest.
mr.
a,
then
gives
the
syndicator
a
check.
unfortunately,
mr.
a
is
the
unsuspecting
innocent
public,
he
doesn't
make
out
a
check
to
the
promoter
in
his
name
as
escrow
e
or
the
specific
parcel
in
some
instances,
he
gives
them
the
check
to
his
own
order.
in
some
instances,
he
even
he
makes
it
out
as
agent,
in
some
instances
he
makes
the
check
out
as
escrow
e.
the
promoter
in
turn
takes
these
checks;
in
some
instances
deposits
it
into
a
special
account.
when
he
is
a
high
class
honest
promoter,
he
keeps
it
intact
for
the
specific
purpose
given
to
him
to
invest
in
a
specific
parcel.
when
he
is
a
crook
or
an
embezzler
as
john
malakoff
was,
he
takes
the
money,
diverts
much
of
it
for
his
own
use;
uses
part
of
it
for
one
purpose,
part
of
it
for
another
purpose.
this
is
the
saga
of
the
nazareth
case.
it
started
off
in
1951
of
april.
eddy
malakoff
was
a
real
estate
operator.
he
bought
this
nazareth
market
in
pennsylvania.
he
had
an
uncle,
john
in
new
york.
john
was
a
promoter
and
syndicator.
eddy
malakoff
had
paid
only
$47,500
cash
for
the
entire
parcel,
subject
to
certain
adjustments.
john
malakoff,
a
fraudulent
promoter
in
new
york
who
was
the
uncle
of
eddy
is
met
by
eddy
in
new
york.
four
people
are
present.
eddy
and
john
induce
those
four
people
to
buy
at
one-fourth
interest
for
$16,000.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
i
believe,
your
honors
we've
reached
new
york
where
eddy
and
his
philadelphia
group
came
with
his
uncle
john;
met
his
uncle
john,
four
people
were
there
and
they
sold
them
a
one-fourth
interest
for
$16,000.
the
money
was
given
by
these
people.
that's
also
by
an
exhibit
of
john
malakoff's
record.
anything
i
state
your
honor
you
will
find
in
the
brief
represented
by
an
exact
exhibit
or
statement,
not
my
statement.
these
moneys
that
were
paid
for
the
purchase
of
this
nazareth
market
was
entered
on
the
books
of
a
partnership
as
a
capital
contribution,
so
that
the
purchase
price
of
$47,500
cash
was
the
capital
contribution
of
a
partnership
although,
they
have
titled
in
several
corporate
banks
because
they
gyrated
this
property
between
two
corporations
and
two
partnerships.
i
cannot
have
the
time
to
go
into
that
your
honors,
it's
within
the
brief.
then,
john
malakoff
agreed
to
buy
the
entire
market.
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
$16,000
that
the
original
four
people
gave
as
their
investment
was
entered
in
the
books
and
records
not
in
their
credit,
but
for
the
credit
of
john
malakoff,
the
promoter.
it
must
also
be
borne
in
mind
that
--
and
according
to
the
record
of
malakoff,
he
was
only
to
get
one-third
profit
in
the
event
of
resale.
so,
he
owned
nothing
at
that
time
in
equity
and
in
fact
merely
a
technical
entry
in
a
book.
the
peculiar
thing
is
your
honors
that
the
petitioner
in
his
main
brief
and
throughout
eight
years
or
seven
years
has
contended
that
john
malakoff
owned
this
nazareth
equitably
and
owned
the
stock
of
the
corporation.
he
has
never
submitted
to
this
court
the
basis
of
that
ownership,
because
there
is
none,
factually
there
isn't
any,
none
of
john
malakoff's
money
went
into
this
transaction,
not
one
cent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
defrauded
the
public
and
took
almost
$100,000
and
pocketed
it,
over
and
above
the
purchase
price
and
this
is
how
he
and
the
philadelphia
group
did
it.
when
john
malakoff
agreed
to
buy
sometime
in
july
of
1951,
the
entire
nazareth
deal,
in
fact
he
was
acting
for
the
general
public,
because
he
was
going
to
get
the
money
from
them
not
his
money.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
same
purchase
price
that
the
philadelphia
group
paid
for
it
plus
$2,000
in
adjustments
and
then
even
the
district
court
didn't
know
the
amount,
an
undisclosed
amount,
which
eddy
malakoff
claimed
was
$30,000,
but
in
essence
it
was
the
same
purchase
price
that
john
malakoff
was
supposed
to
pay
the
philadelphia
group,
but
that
wasn't
what
they
were
going
to
get
justice
goldberg,
because
what
they
were
going
to
get
was
as
much
money
as
they
could
collect
from
the
public.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
the
same
purchase
--
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
the
same
purchase
price,
$66,000
was
the
sale
subject
to
two
mortgages
of
$18,500
cash
involved
$47,500.
unfortunately,
i
must
say,
neither
the
examiner
or
the
master
or
the
district
court
saw
these
particular
facts,
which
were
directly
in
evidence
in
statements
and
schedules,
but
they
are
there
to
be
seen
unquestionably.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
now
that
money
came
from
the
general
public,
because
what
happened
as
john
malakoff
agreed
to
purchase
this
property,
he
kept
collecting
from
the
innocent
investors,
money.
as
he
got
their
money,
he
paid
off
the
philadelphia
group.
not
only
did
he
do
that,
but
the
philadelphia
group
converted
this
capital
contribution
that
i
spoke
of,
the
$47,500
cash
from
a
contribution
in
the
partnership
books.
they
converted
it
into
a
loan
account,
so
here
we
have
the
purchase
price,
again
an
indebtedness
of
the
partnership
and
they
then
formed
the
debtor
corporation
and
transposed
the
ledger
sheet
into
the
corporate
books
of
account.
so
what
happens
at
that
stage
of
the
game?
the
corporation
owes
the
philadelphia
group
and
john
malakoff
the
$16,000,
$17,000
that
the
people
gave
him
originally
on
the
books
of
the
debtor
corporation.
john
malakoff
is
collecting
money
from
innocent
investors
and
bank
of
philadelphia
on
top
of
it,
almost
$60,000.
and
the
debtor
corporation
is
insolvent,
because
the
only
capital
that
they
left
was
$1500,
the
rest
were
debts.
the
property
was
covered
by
the
debts
of
the
purchase
price
sold
to
philadelphia
and
owed
to
john
malakoff
and
that's
how
they
started.
in
1952,
they
lost
money
and
they
were
technically
insolvent
and
malakoff
was
still
collecting
money.
now
the
corporation
was
technically
insolvent,
liabilities
exceeded
assets
and
john
malakoff
was
selling
the
innocent
public
waste
pieces
of
paper.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
it
couldn't
have
gotten
in
for
this
reason
judge
goldberg
and
there
comes
the
distinction
where
the
court
of
appeals
was
absolutely
justified
in
what
they
did,
because
the
true
situation
in
the
issue
here
is
very
simple.
once
you
get
away
the
clouds
and
all
this
nonsense
that
has
been
inside
of
in
this
case.
the
fact
is
this.
john
malakoff
had
creditors,
personal
creditors
and
people
that
he
owed
obligations
to.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
yes
sir,
other
deals.
he
couldn't
pay
the
antecedent
indebtednesses,
and
he
couldn't
pay
these
creditors.
these
creditors
pressed
him
for
money
or
they
said
the
deal
is
no
good,
we
want
something
else.
so,
john
went
ahead
and
gave
them
interests
in
the
nazareth
property.
these
are
the
people
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
are
not
entitled
to
share,
because
they
never
contributed
anything.
they
never
intended
to
contribute
anything.
they
never
invested
in
the
specific
parcel
of
property
of
nazareth
and
besides
with
your
honors,
if
we
consider
that
as
a
corporation
for
the
sake
of
argument,
the
money
could
never
reach
the
treasury
of
the
corporation
for
creditors.
when
you
sell
stock
of
a
corporation,
the
purpose
is
to
get
the
money
into
the
treasury
as
a
trust
fund
for
creditors.
now
that
was
impossible
under
the
arrangement
where
he
satisfied
his
own
debt,
because
the
money
could
never
reach
the
treasury.
now
these
are
the
people
whose
claims
were
disallowed
and
these
were
the
only
people
whose
claims
were
disallowed.
and
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
do
your
honors.
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
people
that
actually
gave
the
money
for
a
specific
purpose,
for
a
specific
investment
for
this
venture,
their
hard
earned
dollars,
widows,
they
are
the
ones
that
are
entitled
to
share,
not
people
whose
debts
were
satisfied
by
this
fraudulent
promoter's
acts.
certainly
this
court
would
not
allow
this
fraudulent
promoter
to
satisfy
his
own
debts
with
interests
in
a
venture,
which
would
result
in
a
depletion
of
the
innocent
people's
investment.
in
other
words,
the
property
cost
$66,000,
$47,500
cash
and
that
was
the
market
value.
the
petitioner
gets
up
and
says
there
was
no
value
on
this
property,
that's
an
absolute
untruth
your
honors.
the
market
value
at
the
time
of
purchase
and
sale,
it's
in
the
record,
was
$66,000,
$47,500
cash
only
$9,000
in
improvements
that
was
the
value.
now
people
gave
approximately
$160,000,
innocent
investors,
to
allow
malakoff's
creditors
satisfaction
of
their
debt
to
come
in.
the
net
result
is
this;
the
$160,000
never
reached
the
treasury.
the
property
is
only
worth,
let's
say
$60,000
with
the
improvements
and
you've
got
$160,000
against
$60,000.
when
i
start
hearing
language
like
contracts,
mr.
weinstein
or
mr.
john's
interests
were
increased,
it's
ridiculous.
let's
say
mr.
weinstein
gave
$7,000.
the
promoter
was
selling
$200,000
worth,
200
shares
generally
at
a
$1,000
a
share.
$200,000
should
have
reached
the
treasury.
mr.
weinstein
would
have
had
$7,000
in
proportion
to
$200,000
in
the
treasury,
instead
of
what
mr.
weinstein
had
$7,000
or
nothing,
because
the
company
was
insolvent.
how
anyone
can
come
to
this
court
and
say
to
this
court
that
by
this
decision,
mr.
john's
or
mr.
weinstein
or
any
other
investor
increases,
gets
more
than
he
contracted
for,
is
beyond
belief,
just
doesn't
standup
according
to
the
facts.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
no,
your
honor,
i'll
come
to
that,
only
two
sentences
because
i
want
to
cover
the
stock
clearing.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
all
right,
thank
you
very
much
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
now,
your
honors
would
kindly
understand
what
this
philadelphia
group
and
john
malakoff
did.
they
converted
those
capital
contributions
into
loan
accounts
and
that's
the
way
they
carried
the
thing
right
through
into
the
corporation.
so
they
became
creditors
of
the
corporation
for
the
purchase
price
which
was
paid
for
by
the
general
public
and
they
pocketed
an
additional
$100,000
as
far
as
john
malakoff
is
concerned.
now,
this
is
the
man
that
these
petitioners
come
in
and
say
own
this
property,
and
this
is
the
man
they
say
could
satisfy
his
debts
by
giving
interest
to
his
creditors.
i
wouldn't
care
whether
it
was
state
law,
whether
it
was
federal
law,
international
law.
there
is
no
law
in
this
world
that
would
sustain
that
kind
of
a
claim.
gentlemen,
there
is
no
issue
that
malakoff
was
a
promoter
or
a
syndicator
and
a
fiduciary.
he
used
to
get
receipts.
the
investors
received
receipts
from
him
showing,
in
many
instances,
that
he
held
the
money
in
escrow;
he
held
the
money
as
agent.
the
checks
were
made
out
in
many
instances
as
agent
and
escrow
e.
there
were
cases
cited
where
that
type
of
a
situation
clearly
creates
a
trustee
and
fiduciary.
he
only
was
supposed
to
get
a
management
fee,
that's
in
the
record.
the
key
and
the
finish
to
this
entire
situation
happened
as
follows.
on
december
of
1952,
malakoff
was
already
in
trouble
with
some
of
the
innocent
investors
and
he
went
down
to
philadelphia
to
get
the
books
and
records
and
everything
else.
and
when
he
went
down
to
philadelphia
to
get
the
books
and
records
in
december
of
1952,
he
brought
his
accountant
along
and
he
brought
mr.
haller's
attorney
along.
and
at
that
time,
the
accountant
examined
the
records
and
he
said
what's
happened
to
the
money
that
belonged
--
that
the
investors
gave,
the
testimony
is
there.
mr.
malakoff
said
i'll
put
it
in
later.
now,
malakoff,
if
he
owned
this
thing,
he
didn't
have
to
put
any
money
back.
now,
on
top
of
that
as
additional
proof
of
this
terrible
fraud
that
was
committed
here
on
which
the
petitioner
relies
that
malakoff's
creditors
should
share
in
this
estate,
comes
may
and
june
of
1953.
and
again,
mr.
malakoff
now
is
in
very
serious
trouble.
some
one
had
gone
to
the
district
attorney's
office,
there
were
all
kinds
of
trouble
and
that's
in
the
record.
and
mr.
malakoff
goes
ahead
with
his
attorney
mr.
how,
who
was
a
director
and
officer
of
the
corporation
back
in
december
1952
as
well
as
in
may
and
june
of
1953
and
they
pre-date
and
draw
a
fraudulent
set
of
minutes.
and
what
do
they
do
in
these
minutes?
they
provide
that
malakoff
is
to
get
the
stock
for
$75
a
share
and
he
was
selling
it
for
a
$1,000
and
why
did
they
do
it,
to
cover
up
the
fraud
and
he
didn't
even
pay
the
$75.
he
went
and
credited
against
his
phony
loan
account.
now,
this
is
the
man
from,
through
and
under
whom
his
creditors
received
interests,
which
diminished
the
interest
of
innocent
investors
whom
this
petitioner
comes
in
and
says
the
court
of
appeals
did
wrong
in
disallowing
these
interests.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
equitable,
legal
or
otherwise.
i
have
asked
this
honorable
court
to
disregard
this
corporation
entirely.
now,
look
at
the
realities,
actually
what
this
man
was
selling
was
interests
in
a
venture.
he
used
the
corporation
as
his
alter
ego.
he
defrauded.
his
receipts
that
he
gave
and
his
contracts
that
he
gave,
he
stated
that
if
he
wanted
to
change
it
to
a
corporation
he
could
change
to
a
limited
partnership,
so
the
intention
of
the
parties
was
also,
that
this
was
merely
a
transitory
vehicle,
the
corporation
merely
held
title
temporarily,
what
these
people
really
were
buying
was
shares
and
interests.
under
those
circumstances,
through
true
justice,
technical
corporate
law
is
necessary
here,
what
is
the
truth
here?
they
were
buying
shares
in
this
nazareth
market.
this
is
a
perfect
case
for
setting
aside
the
corporation
and
what
was
each
man's
interest,
what
money
did
he
pay,
that's
what
he's
entitled
to,
and
that's
based
on
dollars
and
cents,
that's
the
fairest
way.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
the
court
of
appeals
in
substance
did
that
your
honor,
judge
goldberg.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
felt,
let's
take
these
innocent
people;
they
are
the
ones
that
are
entitled
a
share
of
the
creditors
of
malakoff.
they
didn't
change
their
position
any.
this
was
an
antecedent.
no
estoppel
of
any
kind
can
be
held
there
against
the
innocent
people,
certainly
an
estoppel
can
be
held,
whether
it's
a
joint
venture
or
whether
it's
a
corporation
with
a
president
and
officer.
one
more
thing,
bear
in
mind,
that
this
president
of
this
corporation
john
malakoff,
when
he
satisfied
a
debt
of
a
personal
credit,
then
that
was
a
personal
transaction,
he
wasn't
acting
in
a
representative
capacity.
this
was
a
personal
transaction.
in
the
instance
of
the
innocent
investors,
there
he
was
acting
in
a
representative
capacity
as
agent.
now
there
were
fundamental
differences
between
the
investors
and
non-investors,
they
are
apparent
on
the
face
of
it,
and
why
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
the
way
they
did.
the
investors
gave
their
actual
dollars.
the
non-investors
gave
nothing,
because
they
merely
got
paid
in
satisfaction
of
a
personal
debt
of
john
malakoff
to
them.
they
changed
their
position,
nothing,
they
gave
nothing,
and
antecedent
debt
is
not
a
good
faith
purchase.
the
investors
relied
on
john
malakoff
in
a
representative
capacity,
the
non-investors
could
not
rely
on
them
in
a
representative
capacity,
because
the
non-investors
satisfied
merely
a
debt.
now,
this
was
in
fraud
of
creditors
incidentally.
there
were
existing
creditors,
and
the
statement
showed
there
were
existing
creditors.
so
what
was
done
by
john
malakoff
to
satisfy
his
own
debt?
would
estoppel
of
corporation
where
the
money
should
have
gone
into
the
treasury
was
of
absolute
fraud
of
existing
and
future
creditors,
that's
beside
the
point,
beside
the
innocent
stuff.
there's
been
a
question
raised
about
applying
state
law
and
about
applying
federal
law.
there
was
no
question
that
this
is
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
so
been
adjudicated,
and
that
they
were
bankrupt.
section
196
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
chapter
x
proceeding,
gives
the
bankruptcy
court
the
power
to
determine
the
interests
of
stockholders.
article
1
section
8(4)
of
the
constitution
provides
for
a
uniform
enactment
in
bankruptcy.
section
2(a)
of
the
bankruptcy
act
provides
allowance,
disallowance
in
subordination
of
claims.
section
7
causes
the
estates
of
bankruptcy
to
be
collected,
reduce
the
money
distributed
and
determine
controversies
in
relation
thereto,
and
to
liquidating.
section
17
says,
title
to
all
property
is
in
the
bankrupt.
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
have
set
down
a
definite
pattern
and
a
definite
law
that
a
bankruptcy
court
has
the
powers
equitably
to
determine,
to
allow,
disallow,
subordinate
the
time
and
rights
of
parties
claiming
an
interest
in
and
to
any
property
that
comes
into
the
possession
and
is
owned
by
the
bankrupt
in
a
bankrupt
state
and
then,
by
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
of
which
the
court
takes
jurisdiction
of.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
no
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
no
your
honor.
well,
i
am
glad
you
raised
that
question.
nowhere
in
the
entire
brief,
now
the
petitioners
come
in
here
and
cry
blue
murder
and
they
say,
state
law
should
be
applied.
they
haven't
given
one
case
of
new
york
state
or
pennsylvania
or
any
other
state,
which
shows
that
in
an
insolvent
state,
people
that
haven't
paid
for
an
interest,
that
are
creditors
of
any
promoter
are
entitled
to
share
on
an
equal
basis
with
innocent
investors.
there
isn't
a
case
they
have
given
on
it.
they
merely
cry
that
state
law
should
be
applied,
what
state
law?
and
i
say
your
honors
there
can
be
no
court
that
under
these
circumstances
would
give
creditors
of
a
fraudulent
promoter
and
interest
in
the
lease
of
bankrupt
estate,
which
results
in
diminution
of
the
interest
of
innocent
investors,
it
can't
be.
there
has
been
much
ado
raised
about
the
rules
of
decision
act
your
honors
and
the
rules
of
decision
act
was
decided
in
local
loan
company
against
hunt,
292
u.
s.
234.
in
that
case,
the
court
clearly
surveyed
it,
it's
on
page
17
on
my
brief.
the
court
clearly
said,
we
find
it
unnecessary
to
consider
whether
this
contention
would
in
a
different
case
find
support
in
34
of
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
now
725,
titled
so
and
so.
since
we
are
of
the
opinion
that
it
is
precluded
here
by
the
clear
and
unmistakable
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
act
that
is
important
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
present
case
is
one
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
state
court,
but
as
the
defendant
suit
to
vindicate
the
decrease
of
the
federal
court
of
bankruptcy
anchored
in
the
exercise
of
the
jurisdiction
essentially
federal
and
exclusive
in
character
and
in
that
situation,
which
we
address
ourselves
until
which
our
decision
is
confined.
naturally,
if
the
bankruptcy
court
has
to
weigh,
sift
the
different
rights
of
the
different
parties
to
the
lease,
they
must
depend
on
particular
circumstances
of
the
case
and
they
must
equitably
apply
their
own
principle,
because
it
depends
on
each
particular
case.
in
the
case
of
erie
against
tomkins,
which
has
raised
such
a
big
bubble
by
the
petitioner
and
which
for
a
while
was
troublesome
to
most
of
the
federal
courts,
because
previously
the
federal
courts
clearly
had
said,
a
bankruptcy
court
does
not
have
to
apply
generally
state
law,
it
can
apply
its
own
principles
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
erie
against
tomkins
came
along
and
that
was
a
tort
case,
a
non-diversity
tort
case
and
the
court
in
that
case
properly
held
it's
a
tort
case,
non-diversity
case,
happened
in
a
particular
state,
we
should
apply
the
laws
of
that
state,
they
were
correct.
unfortunately,
students
of
the
law
and
the
lower
courts
started
to
apply
that
case
to
bankruptcy.
what
happened
your
honors?
on
three
occasions,
this
court
has
held
that
erie
against
tomkins
doesn't
apply
in
bankruptcy
cases.
they
held
it
in
pepper
against
litton,
now
i
haven't
got
time
to
read
the
full
decision.
they
held
it
in
heiser
against
woodruff
and
they
held
it
again
in
the
vanston
case
that
your
honor
judge
black
asked
about.
i
am
sorry,
i
believe
judge
brennan
asked
about
the
vanston
case
originally.
now,
in
the
vanston
case,
it
explicitly
states
in
determining
what
claims
at
vanston
against
green
329
u.s.
156
clearly
stated
in
determining
what
claims
are
allowable
and
how
a
debtor's
assets
shall
be
distributed,
the
bankruptcy
court
does
not
apply
the
law
of
the
state
where
it
sits.
erie
against
tomkins
had
no
such
implication,
but
bankruptcy
courts
must
administer
and
enforce
the
bankruptcy
act
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
accordance
with
authority
granted
by
congress
to
determine
how
and
what
claims
shall
be
allowed
and
under
what
equitable
principles.
in
gardner
against
new
jersey
and
this
was
a
case
where
the
state
came
in
and
said,
we
are
entitled
to
certain
taxes,
our
law
says
this
is
what
we
are
entitled
to
get.
and
you
must
recognize
our
state
law.
in
that
case
and
if
we
had
to
recognize
state
law
then,
then
presumably
and
this
court
would
so
hold,
we'd
have
to
recognize
it
throughout.
and
in
the
gardner
case,
the
court
held,
without
that
sifting
process,
unmeritorious
or
excessive
claims
might
dilute
the
participation
of
the
legitimate
claimants.
it
is
the
traditional
bankruptcy
law
that
he
who
invokes
the
aid
of
the
bankruptcy
court
by
offering
a
proof
of
claim
and
determining
its
allowance
must
abide
the
consequences
of
that
procedure,
[inaudible]
on
bankruptcy
clearly
supports
the
contention
that
a
bankruptcy
court
has
to
go
through
this
sifting
process.
what
the
petitioners
would
like
a
bankruptcy
court
to
become
is
an
administrative
office.
once
a
state
says
a
claim
theoretically
is
good,
the
bankruptcy
court
must
acknowledge
it
and
must
allow
it
to
share.
the
federal
court
is
not
an
administrative
office
and
that
was
not
intended
by
congress.
they
have
a
right
to
look
behind
a
claim.
even
if
it's
a
judgment,
where
it
hasn't
been
tried
and
proved.
they
can
look
behind
the
claim
to
see
if
it
has
any
merit
and
this
is
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
this
particular
case
and
their
ruling
on
that
base
should
be
approved.
now
a
very
unique
and
a
very
unusual
theory
were
expounded
by
the
petitioner.
he
called
it
recapitalization
and
he
said
what
these
promoters
did,
what
the
philadelphia
group
and
john
and
eddy
malakoff
was
business
sophistication,
the
words
sound
beautiful.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
alright
your
honor,
how
much
time
i
have
your
honor.
i
am
sorry,
under
249
just
one
thing,
if
you
please,
one
very
important
thing
if
you
please,
thank
you
your
honor.
the
question
of
res
judicata
is
very
important
to
me
your
honors.
i've
worked
on
this
case
for
nine
years,
10
years
for
this
debtor
unfortunately
so,
unfortunately
so.
as
an
officer
of
this
court
and
as
an
attorney
for
the
debtor
and
debtor
in
position,
i
felt
that
it
was
my
duty
to
find
out
who
are
the
honest
claimants
and
who
are
the
dishonest
claimants
and
put
everybody
to
their
proof,
i
didn't
pick
any
particular
claimant.
when
the
claimants
put
in
their
proof,
all
the
claimants
put
in
their
proof
and
i
made
every
one
of
them
put
their
proof
through
a
trial.
i
had
asked
that
in
the
event
the
court
allows
a
claim
and
the
money
was
not
paid
and
no
investment
was
made
and
the
court
allows
the
claim,
i
said
the
least
the
court
can
do
is
make
him
pay.
the
district
court
allowed
all
the
claims
investors,
non-investors
whoever
it
was
and
i
felt
that
was
an
error,
but
then
allowing
all
the
claims
control
was
timed
over
to
a
mr.
danciger
and
to
the
petitioner's
group,
control
of
the
board
of
the
directors
of
this
debtor
and
the
result
was
that
they
didn't
allow
me
to
appeal.
they
wouldn't
even
pay
for
the
brief,
printing
of
the
brief,
i
felt
it
was
wrong.
fortunately,
they
appealed
and
i
interposed
this
entire
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
interposed
this
claim
that
we
are
entitled
to
receive
money
in
the
event
stock
is
allowed.
the
court
of
appeals
fortunately
granted
the
first
alternative
relief,
they
disallowed
the
claims.
under
those
circumstances,
i
couldn't
ask
for
money.
i've
gotten
the
relief
i
wanted
in
the
alternative.
if
by
chance,
this
court
for
any
technical
reason
allows
these
claims,
i
say
there
is
no
res
judicata.
i
still
should
be
entitled
on
behalf
of
this
debtor
to
get
the
money
into
this
debtor
corporation
that
wasn't
paid
for
the
purchase
of
stock
by
these
non-investors.
i
was
only
stopped
by
the
petitioners
who
took
control
of
this
debtor
corporation.
now
it's
with
poor
taste
that
they
come
before
this
court
and
try
to
charge,
res
judicata
against
this
debtor
under
those
circumstances.
and
so
far
the
249,
your
honors,
i
took
â€“
the
debtor
had
to
take
the
following
position.
there
were
some
raiders
in
the
course
of
the
debtors
reorganization
and
i
used
that
expression
well
advisedly.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
raiders,
r-a-i-d-e-r-s,
your
honor.
it
isn't
the
raiders
that
we
see
on
television,
your
honor.
these
raiders
were
represented
by
the
petitioner
and
petitioner's
attorney.
they
had
a
tenant
of
the
debtor
by
the
name
eric.
this
tenant
by
the
name
of
eric
wanted
to
get
a
preferential
lease.
he
was
only
paying
$9,000.
in
the
interest
of
the
debtor
we
tried
to
get
the
most
money
that
we
could.
we
thought
we
could
get
$50,000,
realtor
refused
to
pay
it.
he
then
went
out
together
with
his
attorney
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
petitioner's
attorney
and
started
to
raid
this
debtor
in
the
organization
and
they
started
to
buy
up
stock.
some
--
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
i
believe
there
are
some.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
that's
right,
right
in
the
record
he
admitted
it.
he
admitted
it,
he
got
up
on
the
stand
and
if
your
honor
will
give
me
time
i
will
show
you
right
in
the
record,
the
man
got
up
on
the
stand
and
said,
if
i
get
control
i
am
going
to
give
myself
an
exclusive
lease
that
i'm
going
to
pay
as
much
as
i
can.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
all
right,
i
will
give
it
you,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
i
will
your
honor.
the
facts
arise
in
this
manner,
your
honor.
when
these
raiders
started
to
buy
up
the
stock,
some
of
the
stock
claims
notified
mr.
weinstein
and
mr.
fried
that
they
had
been
approached
by
these
raiders
to
buy
the
stock.
weinstein
and
fried
then
said
to
them,
don't
sell
the
stock
would
be
all
right
after
reorganization.
they
said
we
have
to
sell
because
we
want
to
get
out
of
this
thing,
it's
nine,
ten
years
going.
we
haven't
received
a
penny,
we
are
going
to
sell
it.
even
though
they
were
advised
by
weinstein
and
fried's
offices
not
to
sell
it,
weinstein
was
the
officer,
fried
the
employee
and
that's
in
the
record
so
admitted
and
so
testified
to.
they
under
those
circumstances
sold
the
stock
to
weinstein
and
fried
and
the
record
explicitly
says,
that
the
district
court
doesn't
say
they
did
anything
immoral
or
not
in
the
interest
of
the
debtor,
but
the
district
court
says,
technically
because
you
did
buy
stock
then
i
hold
that
you
violated
section
249.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
nobody
lost
anything,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
nothing,
except
that
the
petitioners
wanted
to
get
rid
of
the
--
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
there
was
no
money
lost.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
he
gets
control
of
the
debtor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
yes
sir,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
no
your
honor.
nothing,
they
merely
removed
them
from
office
and
the
district
court
gave
--
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
yes,
stopped
their
compensation
and
said,
they
couldn't
do
anything
with
the
management
of
the
debtor
and
turned
the
management
over
to
the
attorney
for
the
raiders.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
it.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
that
is
right,
under
249.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
compensation.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
it's
a
weekly
compensation,
$200
a
week
for
running
the
market
for
the
manager
and
$50
a
week
for
president
who
goes
up
there
once
a
week.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
that's
been
for
over
eight
to
ten
years,
but
what
they
did
judge
black.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
if
the
court
was
to
sustain
that
they
did
an
immoral
act,
an
equitable
act
then
the
district
court
could
have
made
them
give
back
the
$200
a
week
for
the
last,
as
far
as
mr.
fried
approximately
for
the
last
seven
to
eight
years.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
refunded
and
$50
a
week
for
mr.
weinstein
for
a
number
of
years.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
yes,
that
would
have
been
--
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
definitely
moved
them,
they
moved
their
authority
back.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
that
is
right
sir.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
not
to
my
knowledge
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
the
petitioners.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
no,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
they
would
have
an
interest,
because
they've
also
bought
good
stock
in
the
course
of
their
raiding,
they
got
bad
stock
your
honor,
and
they
bought
good
stock.
now
--
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
in
the
course
of
this
rating,
not
only
did
i
attack
the
stock
of
mr.
weinstein
and
mr.
fried,
which
was
purchased
on
behalf
of
the
debtor,
but
i
attack
the
stock
which
was
purchased
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
i
believe
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
frankly
your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
they
appealed
from
that
portion
of
the
case
to
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
however,
mr.
harper
is
going
to
cover
this
249
exclusively
and
he'll
cover
it
fundamentally
himself.
mr.
alex
l.
rosen
yes.
in
conclusion
your
honors,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
stock
claims
should
be
sustained.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
249
should
be
sustained,
not
only
because
there
was
nothing
inequitable
done,
but
because
this
debtor
corporation
from
an
insolvent
condition
presently
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
earning
$45,000
to
$50,000
a
year
and
on
behalf
of
the
debtor,
we
were
not
interested
in
removing
the
management
for
not
doing
anything
immoral
under
the
technical
provisions
of
249.
i'm
sorry
your
honors
i
have
taken
more
time
than
i
should
and
i
hope
you
won't
take
it
away
from
mr.
harper.
thank
you
very
much.
