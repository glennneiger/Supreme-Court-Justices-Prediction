mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
here
is
here
on
certiorari
on
question
one;
the
petitioner
relies
on
rule
52(b)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
the
petitioner
was
indicted
on
four
counts,
on
bribery
charges
alleged
to
have
been
committed
in
violation
of
title
18
u.s.c.,
section
201.
the
petitioner
was
found
not
guilty
on
count
one,
which
alleged
that
the
petitioner
bribed
united
states
revenue
agent,
roger
s.
davis
on
october
24,
1961
and
violated
[inaudible]
to
refrain
from
making
an
examination
of
books
and
records
relating
to
sales
and
receipts
of
the
bar
and
lounge
at
clauson's
inn,
falmouth,
massachusetts
in
the
years
1959
and
1960
and
the
first
two
quarters
of
the
year
1961
from
computing
tax
on
said
sales
and
receipts
and
reporting
the
same
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
tax
alleged
is
a
cabaret
exercise
tax
that
would
attach
if
the
operation
was
conducted
with
the
entertainment
of
singing
or
dancing
in
connection
with
the
playing
of
the
orchestra
or
jukebox.
there
was
evidence
at
the
trial
to
support
the
charge
in
count
one
that
the
petitioner
offered
agent
davis
a
bribe
of
$420
on
october
21,
1961.
on
the
record
of
the
trial,
there
was
no
dispute
that
the
petitioner
gave
and
agent
davis
received
$420
on
october
21,
1961.
the
issue
was,
whether
it
was
given
and
received
as
a
bribe
and
the
jury
decided
that
is
was
not
a
bribe
under
the
charge.
counts
two,
three
and
four
alleged
that
the
petitioner
bribed
agent
davis
on
october
24,
1961
with
intent
to
influence
him
to
conceal
from
the
government
the
sales
and
receipts
of
any
cabaret
tax
due
thereon
for
the
petitioner's
operation
of
the
bar
and
lounge
at
clauson's
inn
for
the
years
1959,
1960,
1961
and
thereafter.
the
jury
returned
guilty
verdicts
in
counts
two,
three
and
four.
the
uncontroverted
facts
established
by
the
government's
evidence
are
set
out
for
record
references
on
pages
6
to
16
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
the
facts
show
as
follows:
first
of
all,
the
record
is
darn
of
any
activity
in
the
petitioner's
business
operation
at
clauson's
inn,
showing
that
the
petitioner
conducted,
held
out
or
knowingly
permitted
the
singing
or
dancing
entertainment
that
would
create
the
tax
liability
prior
to
october
16,
1961,
at
which
time
the
policy
was
changed
to
offer
such
entertainment
as
shown
on
the
books
of
the
petitioner
and
on
the
defendant's
exhibit
d
in
the
record.
further
at
the
trial,
government
agent
davis
testified
that
he
knows
no
basis
for
a
cabaret
tax
liability
on
the
operation
prior
to
august
31,
1961.
the
revenue
inspection
service
organized
a
plan
to
entrap
the
petitioner
by
arranging
for
agent
davis
to
go
to
clauson's
inn
on
october
24,
1961
and
meet
with
the
petitioner
at
the
petitioner's
private
office
according
to
their
stated
purpose,
to
relate
back,
the
conversation
of
davis
and
the
petitioner
to
the
meeting
of
october
21,
1961.
agent
davis
testified
that
his
agreement
with
the
petitioner
was
to
return
to
the
premises
so
that
he
could
file
a
return
if
due.
agent
davis
came
to
clauson's
inn
on
october
24,
1961
in
concert
with
other
agents
with
a
minifon
on
his
person.
invited
himself
into
the
petitioner's
office
and
the
minifon
recorded
what
the
petitioner
and
agent
davis
said
and
did
at
the
meeting.
the
minifon
recording
is
an
evidence
over
objection
and
shows
at
the
outset
of
the
meeting
of
october
24,
1961,
that
the
plan
was
frustrated
by
a
statement
of
the
petitioner
stating,
“i
never
did
thought
a
cabaret
tax,
i
never
thought
there
was
a
need
of
it.”
this
statement
registered
the
mind
of
the
petitioner
then
and
there
with
the
force
of
a
verbal
act.
notwithstanding
this
statement,
agent
davis
proceeded
to
convert
his
operation
into
the
making
of
cabaret
tax
claims,
false
and
fictitious
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he
knew
of
no
basis
of
cabaret
tax
for
1959,
1960
and
1961
prior
to
august
31,
1961.
and
that
these
statements
of
fact
of
claims
were
grossly
false
and
grotesque
in
relation
to
the
petitioner's
operation.
agent
davis
stated
to
the
petitioner
at
this
meeting
on
october
24,
1961,
a
claim
of
tax
penalties,
which
was
false
on
the
facts.
immediately
following
this
claim
of
penalty,
agent
davis
made
the
thrust
for
the
bribe,
“now,
i
don't
want
to
get
greedy
or
anything,
but
well
what
would
you
be
gaining?”
in
effect,
the
request
for
the
bribe
and
the
bribe
resulted
pursuant
to
the
request.
as
under
sherman
against
united
states
conduct
of
the
government
agents
relevant
and
important
and
the
conduct
cannot
be
disclaimed
by
the
government,
with
respect
to
the
facts
that
i
have
stated
here,
i
would
ask
the
court's
attention
for
the
following.
referring
to
the
meeting
of
october
21,
1961
the
testimony
of
agent
davis
was,
“i
told
him,”
referring
to
the
petitioner,
“i
asked
him
how
much
money
was
on
the
desk
and
he
said
$420.
about
that
time
i
picked
the
money
up,
it
was
about
10
o'clock.
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
left
his
office.”
when
agent
davis
left
clauson's
inn
with
the
$420
that
saturday
night,
he
was
in
a
predicament.
obviously,
he
was
in
violation
of
regulations
of
his
department
in
any
event.
under
the
regulations,
if
there
was
an
indication
of
a
bribe,
he
was
to
change
the
subject,
close
the
file
and
leave.
he
had
been
attached
to
the
internal
revenue
service
for
two
years
and
was
in
account
of
it.
his
visit
at
clauson's
on
october
21,
1961
was
routine.
a
policeman
investigating
a
matter
is
routine
would
consider
it
as
unthinkable,
to
take
a
bribe
without
a
corroborating
witness
and
then
attempt
to
explain
it
to
a
superior.
and
the
facts
in
this
case,
he
testified
that
he
first
talked
with
a
fellow
agent
after
leaving
the
inn
on
the
night
of
october
21,
1961
and
then
later,
with
his
group
chief
at
the
instance
of
a
fellow
agent.
at
the
time,
agent
davis
on
his
own
testimony
had
no
basis
for
an
excise
tax
on
the
petitioner's
operation,
for
any
time
prior
to
august
31,
1961
and
he
did
not
state
to
the
petitioner
on
october,
21,
1961
that
he
owed
any
amount
prior
to
october
16,
1961.
his
superiors
even
know
or
ought
to
have
known
these
facts
and
also
the
agreement
of
agent
davis
with
the
petitioner
that
he
was
to
return
to
the
premises.
so
that
he,
the
petitioner,
could
file
the
return
if
due,
before
they
started
up
with
the
task
force
equipped
with
schmidt
and
minifon
devices
to
entrap
the
petitioner.
on
the
testimony,
none
of
the
revenue
service
agents
know
of
any
basis
that
the
petitioner
owed
any
excise
tax
on
the
operation.
consequently,
there
is
involved
in
this
plan,
an
operation
of
the
revenue
inspection
service
agents
in
concert
with
agent
davis
and
imputable
to
agent
davis
at
least,
the
relief
of
his
own
situation.
in
relation
to
the
invading
of
the
petitioner's
mind
by
agent
davis
with
lies
to
setup
a
false
promise
for
tax
liability
to
ensnare
and
provoke
him
into
criminality,
it
is
submitted
is
diabolic
in
aspect
and
sounds
[inaudible].
under
sorrells
and
sherman,
entrapment
symbolizes
instigation
of
a
crime
by
government
officers.
also,
the
defense
of
entrapment
is
properly
invoked
from
the
officers
of
the
law.
induce
a
person
to
commit
a
crime,
which
he
would
not
otherwise
have
committed.
agent
davis
from
the
facts
of
this
case
instigated,
incited,
persuaded
and
induced
the
petitioner
to
make
the
bribe
in
circumstances
where
the
agent
created
a
false
framework
of
facts
in
the
petitioner's
mind
of
cabaret
tax
liability,
impossible
to
have
been
conceived
by
the
petitioner.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
and
because
in
my
argument
i
brought
it
up
and
the
judge
charged
on
the
law
of
entrapment.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
no,
not
as
such,
not
until
the
time
of
the
argument
and
of
course,
my
argument
here
is,
on
the
facts
as
established
by
the
government's
case,
with
the
government's
evidence,
having
been
raised
with
the
argument
and
the
judge
having
charged
on
it,
we
are
properly
here
on
that
issue.
may
i
proceed,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
j.
davis
the
offense
--
mr.
edward
j.
davis
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
improper
instructions
as
will
be
shown
under
question
two.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
no,
that's
here
on
rule
52(b)
also,
that's
here
on
rule
52(b)
here
also.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
no,
i
did
not.
the
offense
on
the
facts
on
the
record
could
not
have
been
committed
without
the
construction
of
these
false
premises
by
agent
davis
implanting
them
in
the
mind
of
the
petitioner
and
these
acts
of
agent
davis
manifest
the
construction
and
creation
of
the
crime
by
agent
davis.
it
could
not
be
found
on
any
basis
whatsoever
that
the
petitioner
was
pursuing
a
criminal
design
with
respect
to
the
charges
in
counts
two,
three
and
four
and
specially,
such
a
design
which
he
had
already
conceived
with
relation
to
the
events
of
the
meeting
of
october
24,
1961.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
yes,
he
did.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
he
did
not.
he
testified
in
effect
that
he
was
nervous
and
didn't
know
much
about
what
happened,
it
was
all
been
taken
in
the
minifon
and
the
entire
--
mr.
edward
j.
davis
oh
no,
he
didn't
know.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
my
only
answer
is
that,
he
testified
as
to
the
second
meeting
of
october
24
in
effect
that
there
were
a
lot
of
claims
and
charges
and
he
in
effect
didn't
realize
the
whole
part
of
it
and
he
couldn't
testify
too
much
on
it.
i'll
have
to
refer
to
the
record
on
that
as
to
what
he
said.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
what's
that?
mr.
edward
j.
davis
oh
yeah.
and
he
knew
that
the
government
agent
was
there
under
precise
agreement
to
come
there
to
make
out
that
is
the
petitioner
was
to
make
out
a
return
if
due
that
was
the
exact
agreement.
the
government
in
its
brief
--
mr.
edward
j.
davis
he
didn't
dispute
that.
there
was
no
dispute
about
that
and
on
the
issue,
he
was
found
not
guilty
of
a
bribe
on
count
one.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
the
judge
went
very
far
in
his
instructions
in
that
respect,
i'll
say
that.
i
don't
think
that
there
are
any
intendments
the
way
with
respect
to
of
the
fact
was,
he
was
found
not
guilty
of
the
charge,
that's
right.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
very
pointedly
sir.
the
government
in
its
brief,
i'm
glad
your
honor
brought
that
up,
i
think
i
can
answer
it
at
this
time,
the
government
in
its
brief
imputes
to
the
petitioner
two
alleged
misconceptions,
first
in
effect
that
the
equivalent
of
count
one
was
an
adjudication
of
evidence
requiring
the
rejecting
of
the
government's
evidence
and
accepting
the
petitioner's
version.
on
the
contrary,
the
petitioner's
position
was
that
the
government's
evidence
in
the
case
as
i
stated
it,
establishes
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law.
secondly,
the
government
imputes
to
the
petitioner
in
its
brief
that
by
reason
of
the
acquittal
on
count
one
the
case
must
be
judged
as
though
no
bribe
offer
had
been
made
by
the
petitioner
on
october
21.
again,
the
petitioner
answers,
that
no
such
assumption
has
been
made
as
an
effect
of
acquittal
on
count
one,
but
that
the
offer
of
the
bribe
is
in
effaced,
because
there
was
entrapment
on
the
government's
evidence.
if
in
fact
the
crime
of
bribery
were
to
be
committed
on
october
21,
1961
under
sorrells
and
sherman,
it
would
be
the
duty
of
officials
to
detect
and
procure
the
evidence,
but
not
to
instigate
and
create
a
new
such
crime
or
another
crime
on
october
24,
1961.
this
principle
was
the
holding
in
sam
yick
against
the
united
states,
240
federal,
cited
in
sorrells
with
approval
where
a
chinese
attempted
to
bribe
an
officer
relating
to
smuggling
chinese.
well
there
apart,
enticed
the
accused
to
combine
with
him
in
illegal
smuggling
of
chinese
and
then
charged
him
with
a
lot
of
crime.
this
was
held
to
constitute
entrapment.
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
klosterman,
248
federal
second
set
out
at
length
in
the
brief,
the
petitioner's
brief,
it
was
decided
as
a
matter
of
law,
there
was
illegal
entrapment
on
the
facts
where
a
federal
agent
was
charged
with
bribery
to
close
an
income
tax
case.
klosterman
predicated
his
decision
on
sorrells
and
the
case
has
particular
significance
to
the
petitioner's
case
here.
klosterman
on
the
basis
of
sorrells
stated
the
issue
as
whether
or
not
the
criminal
intent
proceeded
from
the
government
agents
of
whether
or
not
these
agents
simply
afforded
opportunities
to
one
already
disclosed
to
be
alleged
criminality.
klosterman
decided
that
the
test
to
be
applied
under
the
principles
governing
illegal
entrapment
is,
“was
the
defendant
a
man
otherwise
innocent
who
would
not
have
committed
the
crime,
but
for
official
solicitation
or
was
he
predisposed
to
pursue
a
criminal
desire,
which
he
have
already
conceived.”
mr.
edward
j.
davis
october
24th.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
i
am
coming
down
to
that
your
honor
please
in
my
second
question.
as
the
court
said
in
klosterman,
an
alleged
bribe
in
connection
with
an
income
tax
matter
is
not
a
recurring
crime
in
a
series.
the
defendant
revenue
agent
deeney
in
the
case
actually
conceived
the
plan
to
participate
in
a
bribe
to
close
a
tax
case
and
approached
a
fellow
agent
that
they
act
together
on
it,
a
fact,
which
the
court
deemed
a
criminal
act
by
itself.
later
agent
deeney
events
the
intention
to
withdraw
and
as
shown
by
the
excessive
persuasion,
he
abandoned
the
intent
and
the
particular
intent
for
the
commission
of
the
bribery
was
thus
originated
and
engineered
by
the
government
officers.
the
court
so
held
and
so
said.
in
the
instant
case
there
was
more
than
excessive
persuasion
by
the
government
agent.
he
originated
and
engineered
the
false
framework
of
facts
as
to
tax
liability
in
the
petitioner's
mind,
which
was
relation
to
persuasion
was
recklessly
and
grossly
false,
grotesquely
in
oddment
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
and
the
petition.
a
brief
examination
of
the
record
on
pages
84
and
85
at
a
glance
will
show
this.
on
the
facts,
it
could
be
not
found
that
the
defendant
was
pursuing
a
criminal
design,
which
he
had
already
conceived
with
relation
to
the
events
of
october
24,
1961,
or
a
general
or
a
special
intent
to
commit
the
alleged
bribe
when
the
government
agent
conceived
and
planned
it
on
october
24,
1961
and
in
terms
of
causality,
it
is
inescapable
that
the
crime
would
not
have
been
committed
but
for
official
solicitation.
now,
if
your
honor
please,
i
will
turn
to
question
two.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
my
answer,
your
honor,
is
two-fold.
first
of
all,
on
the
established
evidence,
if
they
did
take
the
evidence
into
consideration,
that
the
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law,
so
it
should
have
been
beyond
that
consideration.
now
secondly,
if
the
question
would
have
to
come
up
afresh
with
a
severance
of
a
trial,
it
might
very
well
be
objected
to
on
the
basis
in
the
view
of
the
acquittal
as
a
fragmentation
of
evidence.
but
our
position
here
is
that
on
the
evidence
and
it's
clear
on
the
minifon
that
was
introduced
by
the
government
and
the
government's
witness
that
on
the
events
taking
place
on
october
24,
1961
those
facts
show
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law
irrespective
of
what
occurred
on
october
21,
1961,
that
is
my
position.
now
if
i
may
turn
to
the
charge
and
may
i
ask
the
court's
attention
to
page
27
of
the
petitioner's
brief?
the
quote
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
charged,
now
the
law
with
respect
to
entrapment
is
this.
“if
a
government
agent
by
improper
means
or
over-bearing
persuasion
or
wrongful
conduct
induces
a
person
of
ordinary
firmness
to
commit
a
crime,
which
he
would
not
otherwise
commit,
then
under
those
circumstances,
the
defendant
is
to
be
acquitted,
not
because
he
did
not
do
something
wrongful,
but
because
he
was
induced
to
do
a
wrongful
act,
which
he
would
not
otherwise
have
done.”
now
on
the
third
paragraph,
on
page
28,
the
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
entrapment
is
on
the
defendant.
now,
it
is
to
be
noted
that
there
was
no
issue
as
to
how
an
ordinary
person
would
have
reacted
or
done
in
the
position
of
the
defendant.
the
issue
was
whether
the
defendant
was
entrapped,
not
whether
an
ordinary
person
would
have
been,
and
this
is
expressly
filed
and
held
in
united
states
against
monroe
257
federal
predicating
in
on
sherman
in
this
court.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
no
there
not
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
no
i
did
not.
further,
the
burden
of
proof
must
be
allocated.
the
burden
is
upon
the
defendant
to
produce
evidence
that
government
agents
induced
him
to
commit
the
crime,
and
whenever
this
has
been
brought
up
by
the
defendant,
the
government
must
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
inducement
was
not
the
cause,
the
creator
of
the
crime
and
i
cite
united
states
and
laundry
and
lefkowitz
against
united
states
as
appears
on
page
29.
now
may
i
ask
the
court's
attention
to
pages
30
and
31,
and
i
say
this
whole
matter
is
clearly
elucidated
by
judge
learned
hand
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
sherman
200
federal.2d.
may
i
ask
your
honor's
attention
particularly
to
page
31?
judge
learned
hand
is
speaking
of
the
charge
to
the
jury
--
of
the
court
to
the
jury
where
the
jury
had
returned
for
instructions
and
the
judge
concluded
his
charge
as
follows.
“the
law
says
you
can't
trick
anyone
into
it
by
artifice
or
fraud
such
as
giving
a
fabulous
offer,
or
telling
somebody
that
you
are
in
excruciating
pain
and
you
must
have
it,
or
some
such
inducement
that
would
put
the
idea
into
somebody's
head
where
it
never
existed
before.”
continuing
in
the
words
of
judge
learned
hand,
“with
those
as
the
last
words
on
the
subject
the
jury
retired
and
came
back
almost
at
once
with
a
verdict
of
guilty.
so
far
it
concerns
the
defense,
that
is
the
inducement,
it
was
complete
without
"trickery"
or
"fraud."
it
includes
soliciting,
proposing,
initiating,
broaching
or
suggesting
the
commission
of
the
offence
charged.
now
on
the
matter
--
the
issue
was
whether
the
defendant
was
entrapped
not
whether
an
ordinary
person
would
have
been,
the
court
continues,
“we
are
not
sure
whether
the
idea
that
must
not
have
existed
before
in
somebody's
head,
we
assume
this
meant
the
accused
was
the
idea
of
committing
the
particular
offence
charged.
if
so,
it
added
nothing
to
inducement
simpliciter.”
and
the
court
goes
on,
“no
view
can
we
find
that
the
cause
was
presented
to
the
jury
in
such
terms
that
they
could
apply
the
law
as
we
understand
it,
and
the
error,
which
went
to
the
very
heart
of
the
prosecution,
was
grave
enough
to
be
noticed,
although
the
defense
had
not
accepted
to
it.
fed.rules
crim.proc.rule
52(b).
mr.
edward
j.
davis
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
well,
i
think
i
can
move
into
it
directly
by
saying
and
i
base
it
what
i
have
set
forth
in
my
brief.
now
the
law
with
respect
to
entrapment
is
this,
“if
a
government
agent
by
improper
means
or
over-bearing
persuasion
or
wrongful
conduct
induces
a
person
of
ordinary
firmness
to
commit
a
crime.“
i
think
that
shows
error
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
putting
it
into
on
the
thesis
of
an
ordinary
man,
but
in
any
event,
there
is
no
question
about
it,
on
the
judge's
charge
on
the
burden
of
proof,
as
i
have
stated
in
connection
with
mr.
judge
learned
hand
had
said.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
i
think
the
trouble
with
that
your
honor
is
that
he
didn't
allocate
proof,
and
if
so,
it
wasn't
allocated
exactly
on
the
charge.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
that's
right.
now,
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
question
three.
agent
davis
testified
with
respect
to
the
meeting
of
october
24,
1961
on
inquiry
by
the
court
calling
for
precise
statement.
what
i
agree
to
was
to
return
to
the
premises
so
that
he
the
petitioner
could
file
a
return
“if
do”.
thus
the
government
agent
davis'
indifference
to
the
private
office
of
the
petitioner
under
a
precise
agreement
to
transact
clearly
defined
legal
government
business
with
the
petitioner.
and
his
presence
there
represented
to
the
petitioner,
this
time
with
the
minifon
on
this
person
under
instructions
from
his
superiors,
he
invited
himself
into
the
petitioner's
private
office
with
the
purpose
of
business
doing
crime.
at
the
trial,
admission
of
the
testimony
of
the
agent
davis
on
the
minifon
recording
was
objected
to,
as
evidence
obtained
by
unreasonable
search
under
the
fourth
amendment.
if
the
evidence
were
excluded,
the
case
in
counts
two,
three
and
four
would
trail
for
lack
of
proof.
under
application
of
gouled
and
silverman,
the
evidence
was
obtained
via
unreasonable
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
not
to
have
been
excluded
under
the
exclusionary
rule
of
evidence.
on
the
facts,
the
condition
of
the
status
to
the
planned
operating
to
entrap
was
a
misrepresentation
of
the
agent's
status.
he
thus
gained
entrance
to
the
office
by
misrepresentation
of
status
and
his
presence
there
was
by
stealth
and
subterfuge,
but
the
agent
saw
and
heard
the
occurrences
recorded
on
the
minifon
proceeded
from
the
creative
activity
of
the
agent
and
the
stealth
thus
secured
his
presence
there.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
yes,
it's
an
electronic
device
that
is
attached
to
the
person,
the
agent
in
this
case
and
it
records
waves
and
it
could
be
transferred
outside,
but
it
records
--
it
is
a
two-fold
affair.
it
records
right
on
the
machine
what
is
said
and
done
on
this
machine.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
on
a
wired
recorder.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
it's
a
trade
name.
under
the
circumstances,
i
have
about
three
or
four
minutes
on
this
constitutional
question.
your
honor,
please
may
i
have
it.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
thank
you
very
much.
well,
the
intention
by
the
agent
by
direction
of
his
superiors
in
the
office
of
the
petitioner
under
the
deception
with
the
minifon
on
this
person.
i
argue,
was
such
as
to
exercise
powers
in
reality
more
there
if
an
additional
government
agent
were
upon
the
premises
by
stealth
in
concert
with
agent
davis
to
procure
evidence
as
to
what
was
said
and
done.
it
is
submitted
that
agent
davis
was
in
the
office
by
stealth
without
permission
by
reason
of
misrepresentation
of
status
on
the
gouled
versus
united
states.
now
i
have
cited
in
my
brief,
the
case
of
united
states
against
lefkowitz
on
page
46.
and
in
effect,
the
holding
there
that
where
there
was
a
misrepresentation
of
status
by
a
federal
agent.
evidence
in
the
nature
of
information
as
extracted
from
papers
not
covered
by
the
agent's
status
was
in
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
as
decided
by
boyd.
now
that
the
context
of
the
profession
extents
from
prying
or
spying
into
the
private
papers
in
the
home
or
office
was
specifically
argued
by
counsels
for
gouled
in
the
brief
on
which
charles
evan
hughes
was
consulate.
it
was
so
argued
by
serjeant
glynn
with
great
force
in
entick
against
carrington
cited
in
silverman
and
the
principle
so
like
it
was
approved
by
that
court.
the
principle
says
to
invasion
of
privacy
enunciated
by
entick
and
carrington
were
of
course
approved
and
formed
the
foundation
of
boyd.
on
coming
to
this
that
this
principle
and
the
principles
enunciated
in
gouled
--
more
or
so
three
minutes
--
mr.
edward
j.
davis
--
to
the
statement
in
silverman
admitted
to
as
an
essential
to
the
holding
of
the
case.
“this
court
is
never
held
at
a
federal
officer
may
without
warrant
or
without
consent
physically
entrench
into
a
man's
office
or
home
there
secretly
observe
or
listen
and
relate
at
the
man's
subsequent
criminal
trial
what
was
seen
or
heard.”
it
is
submitted
that
the
entrenching
by
agent
davis
under
the
deception
stated
with
a
minifon
on
his
presence
on
the
misrepresentation
of
his
status
was
the
invasion
of
a
constitutionally
protected
area
by
stealth
with
physical
powers
and
reality
more
powerful
that
if
an
additional
government
agent
were
upon
the
premises
by
stealth
in
concert
with
agent
davis
to
procure
evidence
as
to
what
was
said
and
done
and
as
silverman
was
prohibited
by
the
fourth
amendment.
shall
i
have
a
minute?
mr.
edward
j.
davis
the
government
relies
on,
on
lee
versus
united
states,
343
untied
states.
mr.
edward
j.
davis
not
from
my
brief,
from
notes.
there
are
three
elements
of
essential
difference.
you
know,
on
lee,
first
the
agent
was
not
a
federal
officer
or
employee
and
was
a
stool
pigeon
employed
through
the
other.
secondly,
the
stool
pigeon
used
an
electronic
device
to
record
this
in
the
chinese
laundry
open
to
the
public.
third,
there
was
the
question
of
relationship.
there
was
absent
the
relationship
with
a
federal
officer
in
a
private
office
to
have
conducted
a
brief
and
legal
tax
business
with
united
states,
which
by
deception
was
converted
to
a
plan
to
entrap.
this
relationship
i
argue
comes
within
purview
of
the
statement
by
mr.
justice
stewart
in
lanza
against
the
state
of
new
york,
in
which
he
said
with
respect
to
an
area
immunized
by
the
constitution,
the
relationship
was
the
line
[inaudible]
would
particularize
confidentiality,
must
continue
to
receive
safety
and
protection.
