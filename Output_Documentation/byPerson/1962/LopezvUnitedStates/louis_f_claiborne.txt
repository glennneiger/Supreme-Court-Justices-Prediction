mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
issue
of
entrapment,
i
think
the
full
answer
is
disclosed
by
an
analysis
of
the
testimony
in
the
record.
i
won't
go
through
it
in
detail.
i
simply
want
to
point
out
that
there
were
only
fourth
times
when
entrapment
can
be
claimed.
there
were
four
visits
by
agent
to
the
premises,
clauson's
inn.
the
first
time
was
on
august
31st
around
noon.
at
that
time
no
entrapment
is
claimed,
no
offer
was
made,
no
bribe
was
received.
later
that
same
evening
august
31st
there
was
a
second
visit,
but
during
this
visit
there
was
by
agreement
in
the
testimony,
no
conversation
between
the
agent
and
petitioner
and
we
come
to
october
the
21st
in
the
evening.
at
that
time
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
argument
both
in
his
brief
and
today,
no
entrapment
is
claimed.
it
is
however
true
that
the
agent
accepted
$420
from
the
petitioner,
but
he
did
so
according
to
his
testimony
after
refusing
it
several
times
and
without
in
anyway
inducing
it.
this
in
our
minds
establishes
the
petitioner's
willingness
to
bribe
the
agent
and
is
the
beginning
of
the
criminal
design
to
settle
his
tax
liability
through
bribe.
the
same
design
continues
three
days
later
on
october
the
24th
when
there
is
second
meeting.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
he
says
he
was
paying
that
amount
to
the
agent
in
order
that
the
agent
on
his
own
time
prepare
returns
for
the
petitioner.
however,
the
testimony
shows
that
the
petitioner
was
in
his
words
anxious
to
get
a
friendly
and
not
a
belligerent
agent.
on
page
111
of
the
record,
the
following
occurred.
well,
it's
on
page
–
well,
page
111.
now
up
to
that,
i'm
reading
from
the
third
question
down,
now
up
to
that
time,
had
there
been
any
talk
in
any
connection
whatsoever
that
money
of
any
kind,
this
is
petitioner
testifying,
not
up
to
that
time
sir,
he
is
testifying
on
direct
examination
and
answering
questions
from
his
own
counsel.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
petitioner's
testimony
thought
in
answer
to
his
own
counsel's
questions.
next
question,
now
after
that
statement
that
[inaudible]
was
made,
what
next
occurred,
what
was
said
by
you
and
what
was
said
by
him.
petitioner
answers,
“well,
i
said
to
mr.
davis,
i
said,
i
don't
know
how
to
ask
you
this,
but
i
would
rather
have
you
as
a
friendly
agent
than
a
belligerent
one,”
something
to
that
effect.
i
said,
“would
you
be
willing
to
help
me
to
prepare
and
form
a
cabaret
tax
whenever
it
comes
due
and
whatever
is
necessary
to
make
it
up,
if
you
wish
to
do
this
and
on
your
own
time,
i
will
pay
for
it.”
this
is
the
petitioner's
own
explanation
of
the
reason
to
which
he
gave
the
$420.
but
according
to
the
petitioner
himself,
this
is
volunteered
by
him
before
there
is
any
question
of
money
as
the
beginning
to,
before
the
subject
of
money
even
comes
up.
we
think
it's
therefore
clear
that
the
idea
of
transfer
of
money
for
whatever
purpose
originated
in
the
petitioner's
mind.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
this
is
on
october
21st.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
the
petitioner
makes
no
claim
with
respect
to
october
21st,
but
he
makes
no
claim
that
he
was
entrapped
on
that
day.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
think
your
honor's
question
to
petitioner's
counsel
resolved
that
point,
however,
the
acquittal
as
to
october
21st
in
view
of
the
judge's
instructions
merely
shows
that
the
jury
did
not
believe
that
the
money
was
given
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
agent
from
examining
the
books,
but
it
did
not
show
that
the
money
may
not
have
been
given
for
another
purpose
such
as
suppressing
the
tax
liability
regardless
of
the
books.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
tax
liability
wouldn't
have
appeared
in
the
books.
now,
getting
to
october
the
24th,
everyone
agrees,
i
take
it
that
the
only
testimony
with
regard
to
that
date
which
the
jury
can
have
considered
is
the
recording
itself,
recording
is
complete.
it
was
authenticated.
there
has
never
been
any
question
about
it
being
a
true
and
accurate
recording
of
the
events
that
took
place
on
that
date.
now
as
i
understand,
the
petitioner,
his
only
referenced
even
for
october
the
24th,
his
the
only
pinpointed
reference
to
any
claim
of
entrapment
is
after
the
agent
goes
through
a
long
series
of
computations
and
ends
up
with
a
figure
of
$10,000
or
$12,000
as
liability
and
makes
some
remark
at
that
point
“i
don't
want
to
be
greedy.”
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
what
had
already
occurred
on
that
same
date
according
to
the
same
recording
before
any
such
statement
was
made.
on
page
81
of
the
record,
the
recording
is
reproduced
in
the
record
from
pages
80
to
94,
this
is
right
at
the
beginning.
the
agent
walks
in,
the
petitioner
asking
to
have
lunch,
the
agent
refuses,
suggests
they
go
into
the
office,
they
do
so.
the
agent
then
says,
how
long
you
have
been
in
business,
the
petitioner
replies,
two
and
a
half
years,
but
no
facts
or
figures
have
yet
been
detailed.
and
at
this
point,
according
to
the
transcripts
of
the
recording,
at
page
81
towards
the
bottom,
lopez
says,
“i
want
you
to
have
my
confidence
and
i
want
to
have
your
confidence
too.”
davis
says
“well,
what
is
it.”
lopez
says
again,
“listen,
i
want
you
to
understand
100%
confidential,
i
want
you
to
place
as
much
confidence
in
me
too”
and
then
this
interruption
and
turning
to
page,
we
get
a
further
statement
by
lopez.
“whatever
we
decide
to
do
from
hereon,
i'd
like
you
to
be
on
my
side
and
visit
with
me.
deduct
anything
you
think
you
should
and
i'll
be
happy
too,
because
you
may
prevent
something
coming
up
in
the
office,”
and
so
forth.
clearly
there,
the
bribe
offer
is
already
being
made
long
before
the
statement
complained
of
which
appears
on
page
85
towards
the
bottom
of
the
page.
i
think
the
record
so
clearly
dispels
any
notions
of
entrapment
as
a
matter
of
law
that
i
need
not
pursue
that
point.
there
is
a
claim
that
the
instructions
were
erroneous.
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
has
already
suggested
that
the
instruction
as
to
burden
of
proof
may
well
be
cured
by
the
general
instruction
on
burden
of
proof,
which
appears
at
page
129
of
the
record.
but
in
any
event,
even
conceding
that
there
was
an
error
in
the
charge,
we
take
the
position
that
entrapment
was
not
an
issue
in
the
case
at
all.
it
was
not
even
a
tax
issue,
need
not
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
judge
in
submitting
it
to
the
jury
was
merely
responding
to
the
oral
argument
of
the
defendant.
he
was
perhaps
giving
defense
counsel,
something
harmless
for
nothing.
he
gave
the
petitioner
more
than
he
received
in
our
view.
it's
perfectly
clear
that
on
october
24th,
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
was
trapped.
a
trap
was
set
for
him,
in
the
sense
that
the
evidence
of
bribe,
which
had
already
taken
place
was
deliberately
set
up,
but
this
is
a
thoughtcrime
in
saying
that
he
was
entrapped
in
the
legal
sense.
this
is
simply
obtaining
evidence,
it
wasn't
putting
in
his
mind
the
idea
of
committing
the
offense.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
your
honor,
the
testimony
of
the
agent
is
very
clear
that
on
two
prior
occasions
he
had
observed
that
[inaudible]
which
just
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i'm
sorry.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
agent's
testimony
is
very
clear
that
he
had
on
two
previous
occasions,
october
the
31st
at
noon
and
in
evening
august
31st,
at
noon
and
the
evening
and
again
on
october
the
21st,
witnessed
dancing
in
the
premises,
which
would
subject
the
petitioner
to
cabaret
tax.
now
even
this
county,
the
agent's
testimony,
the
recording
shows
that
the
petitioner
admits
the
dancing
had
taken
place
long
before
october
16th
because
he
makes
a
reference
to
the
summer
months.
he
says,
it's
very
difficult
to
stop
the
dancing
on
weekends
on
saturday
nights.
so
he
is
--
by
his
own
means
or
by
the
recording,
clearly
aware
of
the
fact
that
there
had
been
dancing
going
on
that
he
hasn't
been
able
to
stop
it,
but
this
does
subject
him
to
tax
liability.
the
extent
of
the
liabilities,
the
accuracy
of
the
figures
maybe
subject
to
dispute,
but
the
fact
of
a
genuine
liability
i
think
is
beyond
question.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
the
claim
was
made
for
1959,
1960
and
1961
all
of
which
is
occurring
in
the
fall
of
1961.
the
reason
for
choosing
1959
is
that,
that
is
when
the
petitioner
began
an
operation
at
those
premises.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
well,
there
is
this,
your
honor
that
when
the
agent
is
making
these
computations
to
the
petitioner,
all
this
is
attested
by
the
recording,
the
petitioner
does
not
disclaim
a
liability
for
prior
years,
he
might
say
--
as
he
now
says,
all
this
dancing
only
started
recently,
i
didn't
have
it
back
in
1959,
but
he
says
no
such
thing.
he
acquiesces
in
the
computation
going
back
to
march
of
1959,
when
he
took
over
the
operation.
so
there
is
no
claim
that
there
was
a
change
in
status
except
his
belated
claim
that
on
october
16,
1961,
it
was
changed.
but
that
belied
by
the
admission
that
it
occurred
during
the
summer
months.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
that
is
correct
your
honor
that
is
the
government's
position.
to
conclude
on
this
point,
the
court
i
think
already
aware
the
petitioner's
claim
is
very
belated.
he
did
not
defend
on
a
theory
of
entrapment.
he
made
no
motion
for
judgment
of
acquittal
on
the
ground
of
entrapment
or
for
that
matter
on
any
other
ground.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
i
understand
that
your
honor,
but
his
own
testimony
did
take
the
stand
always
was
“i
didn't
do
it.
the
money
i
gave
was
for
preparing
my
tax
return".
he
might
have
said
granted
that
i
gave
the
money
in
response
to
a
request
for
a
bribe
that
it
wasn't
my
idea,
it
was
the
agent's
idea.
he
might
have
defended
on
the
ground.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
through
his
own
testimony.
and
then
of
course
his
attorney
could
have
raised
the
issue
more
directly
by
suggesting
a
charge,
which
he
did
not,
by
asking
the
judge
to
charge
on
his
own,
which
he
did
not.
by
arguing
even
to
the
jury
less
ambiguously
than
he
did,
charged
to
jury,
i
mean
the
closing
argument
of
the
defense
counsel
is
not
in
the
record.
however,
we
have
filed
the
copy
of
it
with
the
court
since
the
question
has
come
up
as
to
a
possible
raising
of
the
issue
there.
and
finally
of
course,
the
defendant
did
not
accept
the
charge
given
and
the
errors
he
now
complains
of
were
only
raised
on
appeal.
now
turning
to
the
second
issue
in
the
case,
the
use
--
well,
as
i
understand
the
petitioner's
argument,
he
objects
not
only
to
the
introduction
of
the
recording,
but
he
objects
equally
to
testimony
of
the
agent
with
respect
to
the
conversation
that
was
recorded.
nevertheless,
we
treat
the
two
questions
somewhat
separately.
as
to
the
agent
himself,
clearly
he
was
guilty
of
no
trespass
in
entering
the
petitioner's
office.
he
used
no
force,
no
threats,
no
substitute.
he
didn't
even
make
an
affirmative
misrepresentation.
he
had
previously
identified
himself
as
a
revenue
agent,
he
was
well
known
to
be
a
revenue
agent.
he
did,
however,
misrepresent
his
purpose,
if
you
will,
in
that
he
didn't
say,
“i
will
reveal
what
you
tell
me”
but
that
is
the
extent
of
any
misrepresentation.
it
is
certainly
less
than
the
misrepresentation
on
lee
on
the
question
of
trespass
by
misrepresentation.
we
of
course
feel
this
case
is
governed
by
the
on
lee
decision.
now
as
per
the
instruments,
it
is
argued
that
the
instrument
was
an
uninvited
guest,
the
instrument
itself
was
a
trespasser.
again,
the
instrument
here
is
no
more
trespasser
other
than
the
instrument
you
know
on
lee.
you
know
on
lee,
it
was
transmitting
device,
here
it
was
a
recording
device.
properly
speaking,
the
instrument
is
more
an
extension
of
the
agent
than
a
separate
third
person.
it
merely
duplicates
by
an
electrical
recording
what
the
agent
himself
mentally
records.
but
even
if
there
were
a
trespass,
we
could
not
understand
the
need
to
exclude
the
evidence,
because
there
was
no
connection
between
the
trespass
if
there
was
one
and
the
evidence
obtained,
which
was
not
physical
evidence
taken
from
a
room,
this
was
not
eavesdropping
on
a
private
conversation
that
was
peculiar
to
that
room.
the
bribe
offer
could
just
as
well
have
taken
place
elsewhere.
in
fact,
the
defendant
was
apparently
willing
to
discuss
the
bribe
at
lunch
in
the
dinning
room.
it
was
the
petitioner's
--
it
was
the
agent's
suggestion
that
they
go
into
the
office
and
his
only
reason
for
so
suggesting
was
that
he
have
been
told,
he'd
get
better
acoustical
results
on
his
machine
if
he
did
it
in
the
quiet
of
the
office.
it
wasn't
privacy
of
the
office,
it
was
a
quiet
of
the
office
that
was
helpful
to
his
mechanical
recording.
there
is
another
fact
which
removes
this
case
from
any
question
of
invasion
of
privacy
in
our
view
and
that
is
that
conversation
which
the
machine
overhears
is
not
one
between
two
strangers
to
the
machine.
it's
not
eavesdropping
on
a
private
conversation
between
two
people
neither
of
whom
knows
that
he
is
being
overheard.
one
of
the
parties
to
the
conversation
from
the
beginning
intends
to
divulge.
the
other
party
knows
that
he
is
talking
to
a
federal
law
enforcement
officer.
he
knows
that
he
bears
the
risk
that
there
maybe
a
breach
of
this
confidence
that
he
is
divulging.
he
takes
the
calculated
risk
and
that
risk
is
in
no
way
augmented
because
the
conversation
is
also
being
recorded.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
but
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
admit
that
the
problem
of
proof
is
facilitated
by
the
use
of
the
machine,
but
--
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
from
the
point
of
view
has
been
--
from
the
point
of
view
of
invasion
of
privacy,
i
don't
think
the
machine
changes
the
situation.
one
party,
the
agent
is
going
to
divulge
the
conversation
in
any
event.
he
is
going
to
publish
it.
he
is
going
to
destroy
whatever
privacy
existed.
the
fact
that
another
or
a
machine
is
going
to
duplicate
this
publication
does
not
affect
the
question
of
privacy
in
my
view.
it
certainly
is
useful
to
the
government.
in
fact,
it's
indispensable
to
the
government
in
many
such
cases
to
obtain
a
second
witness
whether
it'd
be
a
live
witness
or
machine.
mr.
louis
f.
claiborne
your
honor,
i
refer
to
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
rathbun,
it
is
part
of
the
risk
that
in
case
of
a
telephone
someone
will
be
on
the
extension.
i
suppose
that
the
use
of
such
device
as
the
minifon
is
not
so
unusual
as
to
make
it
not
also
part
of
the
risk
when
you're
attempting
to
bribe
a
public
official.
i
think
a
good
answer
to
the
point
was
given
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
todisco
case,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
but
addressing
itself
particularly
the
points
your
honor
made
the
court
said
this.
“the
right
which
appellant
here
says
would
seem
to
be
little
more
than
the
right
to
rely
upon
the
agent's
apparent
inability
to
produce
proof
beyond
his
own
testimony
of
the
substance
of
the
conversation
in
which
he
engaged.
this
has
little
relation
to
an
intrusion
upon
privacy,
which
is
the
problem
at
the
heart
of
the
constitution
of
issues
presented
by
easter.”
we
do
defend
the
procedure
used
here,
we
defend
it
because
it
is
necessary
and
proper
procedure
for
government
agents,
especially
in
cases
where
otherwise
the
testimony
would
be
as
if
they
hadn't
hit.
we
conclude
by
saying
that
the
governmental
activity
in
this
case
is
in
all
respects
correct,
proper.
there
is
no
occasion
to
invoke
an
exclusionary
rule.
there
has
been
no
violation
of
the
constitution.
there
has
been
no
violation
of
federal
law.
there
has
been
no
violation
of
the
federal
rule.
there
hasn't
been
a
violation
of
state
law
for
that
matter.
therefore,
there
is
no
reason
to
exclude
the
evidence
received.
for
these
reasons,
we
think
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
