yes
you
may,
yes
certainly.
chief
justice
earl

did
the
defendant
testify
in
the

testify
that
he
was
entrapped?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he

mr.

chief

what
was

explanation
as
to
the
october
21st
payment
of
400
and
some
dollars?
chief
justice
earl
warren
petitioner's
testimony.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
difference
to
the
opinion
as
to
whether
the
agent
actually
fabricated
a
claim
of
taxes
against
this
man
and
that
it
was
purely
fictitious,
it
didn't
exist
at
all
except
in
the
mind
of
the
agent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
can't
quite
hear
you
mr.
claiborne.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
speak
little
louder?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
far
back
did
the
agent
attempt
to
trace
that?
was
it
to
prior
years?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
anything
in
the
record
at
all
to
show
that
in
1959
or
1960
that
he
was
acting,
he
was
running
a
cabaret,
in
the
sense
that
he'd
have
to
be
taxed
for
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
it's
a
position
where
the
government
that
it
cannot
be
truthfully
said,
that
this
agent
fabricated
a
false
claim
of
tax
liability
against
the
petitioner?
