you
at
some
point
be
able
to
summarize
your
statement
in
summary
form
the
factors
that
led
the
commission
to
dismiss
the
section
5
proceedings?
i'd
like
to
hear
that.
i
understand
before
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
why
did
the
commission
justify
the
proceedings
instead
of

any
method
supposing
this
delay
goes
on
for
10
years
or
whatever
it
is?
is
there
any
method
by
which
any
consumer
interest
can
come
in
and
say
to
the
commission
that
the
ad

protection,
as
you've
described,
interim
protections
are
not
adequate
and
getting
a
hearing
on
them?
