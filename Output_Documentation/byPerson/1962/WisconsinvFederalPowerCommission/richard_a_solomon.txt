mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
court.
there
have
been
a
considerable
amount
of
discussion
here
today
as
to
what
happened
before
the
commission
decided
this
case
and
considerable
amount
of
discussion
as
to
what
happened
since
the
commission
decided
this
case.
and
i
think
it
might
be
of
some
value
to
examine
a
little
bit,
beginning
of
my
argument
what
the
case
was
about
and
what
we
did
decide
in
this
case.
now
basically,
this
phillips
case
consisted
of
two
parts.
the
first
part
and
the
part
which
i
won't
discuss
very
much
here
because
i
don't
really
think
that
it
is
the
crux
of
my
friends'
argument
discussed
in
the
brief
with
respect
to
eight
increase
rates
of
phillips
which
had
been
packaged
together
with
its
overall
rate
system,
which
were
in
effect
between
sometime
between
1954
and
1956
in
which
all
but
one
minor
one
had
terminated
as
of
1958
or
1959.
now,
with
respect
to
these
eight
rates,
the
commission
did
use
the
cost-of-service
which
had
been
derived
by
the
examiner
after
a
great
and
laborious
effort
and
which
have
been
modified
by
the
commission
after
a
great
and
laborious
effort
and
using
that
cost-of-service
as
a
test
decided
that
since
costs
during
the
test
year,
a
test
year
which
nobody
suggested
to
the
commission
was
stale
for
this
purpose,
that
costs
during
this
test
year
were
at
least
some
$9
million
higher
--
lower
than
--
higher
than
revenues.
and
since
all
of
these
increases
put
together
only
amounted
to
about
$5.5
million
that
it
could
reach
a
reasonable
judgment
without
going
ahead
and
determining
the
exact
just
and
reasonable
rate
that
each
one
of
these
things
should've
been
set
at
during
the
period
several
years
earlier
when
it
was
in
effect
that
it
could
reach
a
reasonable
judgment
and
the
only
question
left
as
far
as
that
part
of
the
case
was
concerned,
i.e.
that
there
was
no
basis
to
order
phillips
to
make
refunds
with
respect
to
those
eight
rates.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
the
section
4
point.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they
were
locked-in
a
sense
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
commission's
decision
with
one,
very
minor
one,
none
of
them
had
any
present
existence.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
they'd
been
superseded
by
others.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
right.
now,
the
other
part
of
the
case
and
a
part
of
the
case
which
i
will
want
to
spend
my
time
on
because
it's
obviously
an
important
thing
is
with
respect
to
the
general
hearing
looking
into
the
determination
of
all
of
phillips'
rates.
under
section
5
of
the
act
which
by
its
very
terms
necessarily
is
a
determination
of
phillips'
rates
for
the
future.
now,
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
the
case,
the
commission
at
the
end
of
its
decision
here
terminated
the
proceeding
because
it
believed
that
the
record
made
on
the
basis
of
1954
cost
information
was
out
of
date
stale
for
purposes
of
fixing
rates
for
the
future
as
of
the
end
of
1960
and
i
should
imagine
even
clearer
as
of
1963.
and
equally
important
because
having
gone
through
this
difficult
process
for
the
first
time
in
a
major
rate
case,
the
commission
as
of
that
date
and
the
commission
as
of
this
date
also
was
convinced
that
individual
company
cost-of-service
pricing
were
independent
producers
of
natural
gas
who
are
selling
a
commodity,
gas,
to
the
pipelines
was
not
a
feasible,
workable,
meaningful
way
of
regulating
this
profit.
the
commission
instead
said
that
what
we
are
going
to
do
and
what
we
have
done
is
to
work
to
establish
not
phillips'
rates
and
then
california
company's
rates
and
then
the
texaco
company's
rates
and
then
gulf's
rates
and
of
course
i
don't
mean
to
say
that
it
could
all
be
seriatim,
we
would
do
our
best
to
do
them
at
the
same
time,
but
we're
not
going
to
attempt
to
fix
individual
companies,
company
by
company.
we're
going
to
attempt
to
fix
the
rates
at
which
gas
are
sold
and
each
of
the
major
production
areas
of
the
country
for
all
of
the
companies
who
are
producing
and
selling
gas
in
those
areas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission's
statement
of
policy
which
appears
in
the
record
at
348
has
about
23
of
them.
i
think
that
this
can
lead
to
a
misconception
however.
for
example,
of
those
23
or
4
areas,
three
of
them
are
involved
in
the
so-called
permian
basin
case
which
is
the
first
of
the
commission's
cases
and
i'm
sure
that
in
having
area
hearings,
there
will
be
other
packaging
that
will
come
along.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
lines
of
the
areas
were
adopted
on
the
basis
of
the
commission's
best
judgment
in
1960
subject
to
future
change
as
either
its
information
or
record
information
in
the
area
hearings
were
demonstrated.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
pardon?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
this
is
exactly
why,
for
example,
in
the
permian
basin
case
which
happens
to
involve
one
of
the
largest
production
areas
in
the
country
in
which
three
of
these
pricing
areas
touched
rather
that
attempting
to
try
the
case
area
by
area.
we
packaged
the
three
pricing
areas
which
involved
this
one
production
area
together.
so
that
we
weren't
treating
this
separately
and
similarly,
i'm
sure
when
we
get
to
the
so-called
texas
gulf
coast
production
area
which
is
texas
railroad
districts
one,
two
and
three,
i
think
it's
quite
possible
that
--
if
not
probable,
that
these
cases
will
be
tried
together
so
that
this
can
--
problems
of
adjacency
can
be
threshed
out
and
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
as
far
as
i
know,
the
commission
--
i'm
not
sure.
but
i
should
imagine
that
this
is
a
problem
which
at
least
some
stage
of
the
game,
somebody
claims
that
they
are
not
in
the
area,
they're
obviously
would
be
entitled
to
a
hearing.
now,
whether
this
is
an
issue
in
the
area
hearing,
i
don't
really
know.
i
have
i
recollection
that
the
commission
said,
at
least
at
the
outset,
let
us
try
it
on
these
areas
and
we
can
see
whether
these
are
correct
areas
at
a
subsequent
date.
the
point
i
wish
to
make
is
that
my
opponent's
objection
to
what
the
commission
is
doing,
why
is
not
so
much
with
either
of
our
determinations
not
to
decide,
to
dismiss
the
section
4
proceeding
or
not
to
decide
the
section
5
proceeding
on
this
record,
but
rather
on
our
failure
while
we
were
moving
to
area
rates
to
continue
to
use
in
the
phillips
case
and
all
other
cases
of
the
major
producers,
at
least,
this
difficult
individual
company
cost-of-service
technique
which
the
commission
had
found
was
an
inadequate
and
inappropriate
technique.
and
the
real
question
involved
in
this
case
is
whether
the
commission
must
go
down
two
streets
at
the
same
time
or
can
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion
as
to
how
to
best
and
quickest
do
the
difficult
job
of
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
gas
throughout
the
united
states,
can
use
its
resources
as
it
has
determined
is
the
best
method
of
doing
it.
my
opponents
argue
that
area
rates
at
best
will
take
years
to
formulate,
although
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
14-year
figure
is
an
estimate
justice
prettyman
got
from
one
of
our
colleagues
in
explaining
how
long
it
would
take.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
have
estimated
in
our
brief
here
that
the
first
area
proceeding
involving
permian
basin
which
of
course
is
a
key
one
can
be
decided
by
the
commission
by
the
middle
of
1964.
the
permian
basin
case
is
already
in
being,
if
not
merely
in
being
evidences
in
as
i
speak
today,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
commission's
exhibits
which
were
put
in,
in
november
are
in
process
of
cross-examination.
we
believe
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
how
long
would
it
have
taken
the
commission
to
have
decided
the
phillips
case?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
we
have
estimated
that
if
this
court
was
to
remand
the
phillips
case
with
constructions
to
proceed
to
it,
that
it
would
take
approximately
the
same
amount
of
time
to
decide
the
phillips
case.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
middle
of
1964.
now,
these
are
estimates
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
with
cooperation
and
with
speed
that
we
might
be
able
to
decide
a
reopened
phillips
case
somewhat
earlier
than
the
--
we
can
complete
the
permian
basin
or
it
may
work
the
other
way.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
hearing
was
instituted
on
december
20th,
1960,
two
months
after
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
will
be
about
four
years,
yes
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
as
i
said,
we
do
not
have
23
areas
because
the
permian
case
involves
three
of
the
areas
and
there
will
be
further
packaging.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
--
oh,
in
the
second
area,
the
south
louisiana
area,
there's
a
considerable
amount
of
work
that's
been
done
in
the
case,
we've
got
a
lot
of
information
as
to
producers
and
other
people
have
submitted
to
us.
but
i
think
it
is
no
secret
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
has
not
advanced
as
far
as
permian;
one
reason
of
course
is
that
you
use
one
pile
of
case
at
a
time.
but
another
is
that
there
are
discussions
which
have
been
going
on
with
representatives
of
both
the
producers,
including
phillips
and
the
distributors
including
mr.
mann's
clients,
looking
towards
the
possibility
of
speeding
up
all
these
other
areas
by
maybe
getting
the
national
information
for
these
area
hearings
in
all
or
one
time
rather
than
trying
to
treat
them
seriatim.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
more
producers?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
producers
in
the
permian
basin
area.
most
of
the
big
producers
are
in
the
permian
basin
area.
my
understanding
was
there
are
only
two
or
three
producers
with
over
$10
million
worth
of
sales
annually
that
were
not
in
the
permian
basin.
permian
basin
is
10%
of
the
sales
of
the
nation.
it's
a
big
established
gas
filed
by
no
means
is
smaller.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
southern
louisiana
is
about
20%.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it's
the
newer
field,
yes.
sir,
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
should
imagine
it's
potentially
much
greater.
it
also
has
certain
difficulties
that
the
others
don't
have
at
which
might
have
been
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
was
not
used
as
a
pilot
case
and
that
it
involves
the
offshore
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right,
yes.
it
has
cost
problems,
i'm
afraid,
which
we
don't
have
in
the
permian
case.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
let
me
answer
your
question
this
way.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
change
on
the
attitude
of
the
commission
that
the
best
way
to
do
this
job
is
by
area
pricing.
the
new
commission
is
pushing
if
anything
harder
and
faster
than
the
old
commission
to
establish
area
pricing.
now,
this
is
--
i'll
take
this
out
of
term
because
i
think
it
is
important.
the
old
commission
at
the
time
it
dismissed
the
phillips
case,
on
the
theory
that
it
was
not
good
planning
from
its
standpoint
to
start
this
case
over
to
get
the
material
which
would
be
needed
to
get
a
new
decision
in
phillips
had
about
9
or
10,
maybe
a
little
bit
more
other
cases
which
were
fairly
far
advanced
they
thought
at
that
time
on
an
individual
cost-of-service
basis
which
--
the
one
hunt
which
you
heard
about
was
one
of
them.
the
question
came
up
is
to
--
in
view
of
the
phillips
decision
whether
to
dismiss
this
out
of
hand
and
the
commission
in
a
series
of
orders
in
1960
and
1961
refused.
it
was
reluctant,
obviously,
having
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort
in
these
cases
to
dismiss
them
out
of
hand
without
seeing
whether
there
wasn't
something
that
could
be
salvaged
from
these
proceedings
and
it
has
allowed
these
cases
to
go
on.
i
don't
think
the
record
in
--
what's
happened
with
respect
to
these
other
cases
is
very
much
hope
that
if
we
really
just
put
our
mind
to
it,
we
could
easily
and
quickly
decide
phillips
on
a
cost-of-service
basis
as
well
as
the
other
nine
or
ten
big
people
because
the
fact
is
that
although
we've
refused
to
terminate
this
and
allowed
this
to
go
on,
of
the
nine
cases,
i
used
this
figure,
there
were
three
others
which
were
settled
without
any
examiner's
opinion,
of
these
nine
cases,
three
of
them
haven't
been
decided
by
the
examiners
yet
over
two
and
a
quarter
years
after
the
phillips
decision,
although
they
were
presumably
in
advanced
stages
then.
two
others
have
been
decided
within
the
last
three
months,
two
years
thereafter
and
the
decisions
of
the
examiners
in
these
cases
to
the
extent
that
they
attempt
to
follow
the
phillips
principles
as
they
do
on
cost-of-service,
do
not
indicate
as
our
friends
assume
that
if
only
we'd
proceed
with
cost-of-service
we
would
get
the
type
of
results
of
a
huge
rollback
that
they're
talking
about.
because
of
these
six
examiner's
decisions,
four
of
them
and
these
six
examiner's
decisions
used
not
1954
test
years
but
1957
and
1958
test
years
and
with
these
test
years,
four
of
the
six
examiner's
decisions
come
up
with
the
result
that
we
had
in
phillips
that
there
was
a
deficiency,
less
revenues
as
contrasted
with
cost
as
of
these
later
years.
now,
were
said
--
it
said
that
we
confessed
error
because
we
remanded
this
hunt
case.
we
didn't
decide
that
case.
the
commission
didn't
decide
this
glassell
case
say
mr.
bennett
cited.
the
commission
hasn't
decided
on
5
(a)
basis
any
of
these
new
cases
and
i
don't
know
whether
we're
ever
going
to
be
able
to
but
we
are
not
throwing
them
out
the
window,
we're
going
to
see
what
can
be
done
but
in
the
hunt
case
which
is
the
first
one
that
came
before
the
commission
on
the
examiner's
decision,
what
the
commission
found
was
that
it
was
impossible
to
decide
it
even
if
we
try
to
apply
the
phillips'
techniques.
and
as
i
will
indicate
a
little
later
in
my
argument,
the
basic
assumption
that
is
made
here
that
because
a
cost-of-service
was
derived
in
the
phillips
case
that
that
shows
that
the
commission
has
there
or
could
have
there
if
they've
only
gone
ahead
and
made
the
final
“dotting
the
i
and
crossing
the
t”,
worked
out
cost-of-service,
individual
company
cost-of-service
pricing
just
isn't
correct
because
there's
a
very
major
problem
perhaps
as
major
certainly
as
difficult
as
the
deriving
of
a
cost-of-service
which
the
commission
--
because
of
the
way
it
decided
phillips
never
faced
up
to
those.
and
that
is
the
problem
of
rate
design
and
by
that
what
i
mean
is
this.
it's
one
thing
to
find
after
a
great
deal
of
work
and
effort
in
making
allocations
and
everything
like
that,
it's
one
thing
to
find
what
the
cost-of-service
is
and
match
it
up
against
the
revenues
in
the
test
year
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
that
you're
fixing
just
and
reasonable
rates
under
section
5.
that
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
how
the
individual
rates
of
a
company
like
phillips
which
has
over
350
rate
schedules
scattered
throughout
the
united
states
and
ranging,
as
my
friends
have
indicated,
from
very
low
to
very
high.
now,
the
individual
rates
are
going
to
be
worked
into
this
schedule,
you
have
a
serious,
difficult
rate
design
problem.
now,
the
examiner
in
the
phillips
case
proposed
a
rate
design.
he
proposed
a
rate
design
which
was
a
uniform
rate
for
phillips,
a
uniformed
standard
rate
for
phillips
throughout
the
country.
it
would
vary
only
with
respect
to
the
grades
and
types
of
gas,
but
generally
speaking,
it's
a
tariff
system,
one
rate;
one
company.
of
course,
there'd
be
different
rates
for
different
companies
in
any
given
area,
but
one
rate;
one
country
throughout
the
country
and
this
is
a
feasible
rate
design,
i
guess.
there
are
difficulties
with
it.
it
involve
serious
problems
under
this
court's
sea
arrow
case
because
it
requires
making
findings
that
contract
rates
with
contract
provisions
which
wouldn't
prevent
raising
the
lower
ones
must
be
set
aside
because
this
is
necessary
in
the
public
interest.
i'm
not
saying
that
this
type
of
rate
design
is
illegal
or
improper.
i
do
say
that
it
was
a
rate
design
which
nobody
else
with
the
possible
exception
of
phillips
in
this
phillips
case
wanted,
liked
or
was
pushing
the
staff
of
the
commission
joined
by
most
of
the
interveners
including
–
especially
the
state
of
wisconsin
which
is
one
of
the
petitioners
here
was
arguing
that
this
type
of
rate
design
would
so
upset
the
entire
balance
of
sales
of
gas
which
have
been
growing
up
over
the
20
years
that
it
was
a
hark.
and
they
said,
the
only
thing
you
can
really
do
is
after
you
got
this
one
cost-of-service
for
the
whole
company
then
break
it
down
by
individual
areas
and
have
separate
cost-of-service
for
each
of
the
areas.
the
eastern
seaboard
interveners
which
is
the
term
we
use
for
mr.
mann's
clients
in
case
number
74
didn't
suggest
that,
but
they
had
a
--
still
a
separate
rate
design
which
was
also
calculated
to
prevent
the
general
dislocation
that
the
examiner's
rate
design
would
have
required.
and
the
commission,
as
i
say,
although
it
didn't
decide
it,
did
indicate
and
as
petition
for
--
in
its
decision
on
rehearing
that
it
didn't
agree
with
the
basic
theory
of
the
examiners
rate
design
because
that
rate
design,
as
i
indicated,
was
based
on
the
assumption
that
we
should
have
level
rates
because
different
rates
for
phillips
throughout
the
country
was
discriminatory.
and
the
commission
found
in
this
case
that
the
fact
that
you
have
different
rates
in
the
hugoton
field
of
kansas
where
gas
was
discovered
50
years
ago
and
is
very
close
to
the
surface
as
contrasted
with
higher
rates
in
the
offshore
lands
off
southern
louisiana
did
not
in
and
of
itself
show
any
discrimination.
all
of
which
to
get
back
i
guess
in
my
point,
merely
goes
for
the
proposition
that
this
idea
that
we
had
done
everything
but
decide
in
phillips
and
that
we
could
go
ahead
with
phillips
and
within
a
month
or
two,
or
three
or
four
months,
come
out
with
a
new,
complete
decision
establishing
phillips'
just
and
reasonable
rates
or
as
many
sales
throughout
the
country
just
isn't
true.
as
i
said
i'm
not
saying
to
this
court
that
we
cannot
decide
an
individual
cost-of-service
for
phillips
within
the
next
two
or
three
years,
i
won't
even
say
that
we
couldn't
decide
it
before
we'll
decide
the
permian
basin
case,
but
the
suggestion
that
follows
as
night
and
day
is
really
a
foolish
suggestion.
now,
let
me
get
back
to
why
the
commission
abandoned
individual
company
cost-of-service.
first,
let
me
state
that
it's
a
misnomer
to
talk
in
terms
of
individual
company
cost-of-service
as
the
established
method
for
fixing
the
price
just
and
reasonable
prices
of
producers
of
natural
gas
which
the
commission
junked
because
it
wants
to
experiment
with
an
area
pricing
method,
this
just
isn't
so.
whatever
the
reasons
why
--
whatever
the
history
between
1948
and
1960
may
indicate
to
a
historian,
the
fact
is
that
as
of
1960,
september
1960
and
as
of
january
1963,
there
is
no
established
individual
company
cost-of-service
method
for
fixing
the
rates
of
gas
producers,
independent
gas
producers.
it
can
be
done,
i'm
sure.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir,
no
sir.
they
have
instead
contract
prices
which
are
submitted
to
the
commission
and
the
contract
price
--
you
see,
gas
is
sold
generally
on
20-year
contracts.
you
will
have
a
contract
to
sell
gas
at
a
fixed
price.
it
might
be
with
provisions
to
raise
it
at
various
times.
this
contract
price
will
be
submitted
to
the
commission
and
either
approved
in
the
certificate
or
can
--
or
not
approved.
and
if
they
want
to
raise
it
at
some
time,
if
the
contract
permits
them,
they
come
to
the
commission
with
an
increased
price
and
the
prices
at
the
present
moment
vary
from
producer
to
producer
within
a
field
and
of
course
they
vary
from
field
to
field.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
pipelines
in
buying
gas
from
the
producers,
i
think
approximate
the
post
pricing
but
the
price
that
a
pipeline
will
be
buying
gas
today
will
not
make
up
all
of
the
prices
because
since
you
have
a
20-year
continuum,
you
have
prices
which
are
gas
halfway
through
this
period,
half
quarter
way
through,
etcetera.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we've
got
all
the
contracts
there.
we've
got
all
the
information
from
all
the
producers
there,
cost
information
as
well
as
economic
information
of
their
nationwide
exploration
and
development
activities
and
their
nationwide
production
activities.
we
have
got
all
the
information
there
as
to
their
operations
in
permian
basin
itself.
and
we
are
attempting
by
looking
at
the
cost
and
economic
information
coordination
because
part
of
this
problem
is
a
nationwide
problem
and
for
the
specific
area
to
determine
a
price
of
gas
to
be
solved
from
there
which
will,
as
low
as
possible
because
that
of
course
is
our
statutory
obligation,
but
still
be
sufficiently
high
to
bring
gas
to
the
interstate
market
which
of
course
being
specific
high
--
specifically
high
to
pay
for
the
exploration
and
development
activities
of
the
gas
company
and
bring
this
gas
to
the
existing
market.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
i
do
want
to
make
clear
here
justice
clark
that
the
suggestion
that
going
to
area
pricing
is
junking
cost
considerations
is
completely
untrue.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
extent,
if
any,
to
which
the
so-called
area
price,
field
price,
existing
field
price
will
be
given
to
--
by
the
commission
in
the
permian
basin
case
or
the
other
area
cases
still
has
to
be
determined.
but
if
there's
one
thing
that
is
clear,
it
is
that
the
commission
has
no
intention
of
fixing
area
prices
merely
on
the
basis
of
field
prices,
the
prices
actually
being
bargained
for
in
here.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
sir.
well,
we
--
but
--
we're
attempting
to
find
--
now,
exploration
of
course
is
a
problem
which
is
not
limited
to
any
particular
field.
with
respect
to
permian
basin
and
all
other
areas,
the
exploration
expenses
have
to
be
on
a
national
basis
because
people
are
exploring
all
over,
you
don't
want
them
to
limit
them
to
the
fields
that
they're
in.
we
have
attempted,
we
are
driving
average
exploration
cost
for
all
producers
throughout
the
united
states,
applying
this
to
the
other
permian
basin
cost.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right
and
that
is
averaged
in.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we're
not
trying
to
fix
a
price
for
permian
basin
which
will
only
have
the
exploration
cost
for
permian
basin
or
a
cost
for
southern
louisiana
which
will
only
have
the
exploration
cost
for
southern
louisiana.
exploration
cost
at
least
that's
the
way
the
staff
has
been
producing
--
putting
this
case
on
so
far
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
exploration
for
gas
is
a
nationwide
activity
and
that
the
area
parts
of
the
case
are
not
exploration
expenses.
they
are
development
and
operational
and
expensive.
the
question
of
how
deep
you
have
to
drill
on
a
particular
basin
to
get
gas
is
a
particular
basin
or
area
of
problem,
but
exploration
throughout
the
united
states
is
a
diff
--
very
different
problem.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
want
to
be
very
clear
with
my
answer
to
you.
the
commission,
although
it
hasn't
resolved
these
problems
and
there
will
be
arguments
i'm
sure
made
that
we
have
to
fix
area
prices
at
a
level
which
will
allow
each
individual
producer
in
that
area
to
make
its
cost-of-service
which
is
indicated
here
includes
a
reasonable
return.
everything
the
commission
had
said
so
far
indicates
that
that
is
not
what
it
intends
to
do,
that
it
is
not
intending
to
fix
area
prices
to
guarantee
everybody
a
full
return
because
as
this
court
has
made
clear
even
in
cases
dealing
with
the
genuine
utilities
as
contrasted
with
people
selling
a
commodity,
as
justice
douglas
made
clear
in
colorado
interstate
and
some
of
those
other
cases,
public
utility
regulation
does
not
guarantee
people
upfront
and
is
particularly
true
here
when
we're
dealing
with
the
production
of
natural
gas,
a
mining
type
activity,
we're
inevitable.
some
people
are
lucky
and
some
people
are
unlucky,
some
people
go
out
and
drill
ten
holes
and
finally
get
some
gas
on
the
eleventh,
somebody
else
will
come
along
and
drill
on
the
first
shot
and
get
gas.
the
same
amount
of
gas,
same
quality
gas,
the
commission
is
not
going
to
fix
a
just
and
reasonable
price
for
the
first
man's
gas
ten
times
as
high
as
for
the
second
man's
gas.
and
that
has
been
made
clear
in
our
brief
as
--
that
is
the
--
one
of
the
major
reasons
why
we
have
gotten
away
for
them
--
this
individual
company
pricing
system
because
in
an
area
like
permian
basin
or
southern
louisiana,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
you're
not
really
performing
an
economic
function
to
talk
in
terms
of
setting
just
and
reasonable
prices
for
two
well,
side
by
side,
coming
from
the
same
field,
one
at
five
cents
and
one
at
15
cents,
depending
upon
the
peculiarities
of
an
individual
company
that
happens
to
own
that
or
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
even
one
want
because
many
of
these
areas
you
have
joint
efforts
and
if
you
follow
the
individual
company
cost
of
system,
cost-of-service
of
pricing
method
to
its
logical
conclusion,
you'd
have
different
prices
for
different
--
same
gas
from
the
same
well.
the
fact
is
that
the
techniques
of
ratemaking
which
were
developed
by
this,
in
this
country
over
the
last
75
years,
with
respect
to
the
semi-monopolistic
activities
of
a
public
utility
or
a
pipeline,
gas
pipeline,
or
a
telephone
company
just
have
very
little
relationship
to
the
very
different
problem
we're
dealing
with
here
and
this
has
been
recognized
i
think
carefully
by
this
court
which
is
always
refrained
from
imposing
on
the
commission
any
one
type
of
method
because
they
recognize
that
this
problem
was
in
the
background.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
first
of
all,
the
commission
would
have
to
look
into
this
problem.
obviously,
we
are
going
to
have
to
set
up
a
procedure
whereby
the
man
who
believes
that
there
is
confiscation
can
bring
his
claim
to
the
commission
initially
and
then
presumably
to
the
court.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
but
i'm
not
suggesting
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
of
course
he
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no.
of
course,
you're
asking
me
to
move
ahead
of
the
commission
in
deciding
this
problem
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
as
this
--
your
honor,
will
undoubtedly
remember
this
problem
is
not
a
new
one
in
price
fixing
ratemaking
activities
of
the
various
governmental
agencies.
in
the
tagg
brothers
and
moorhead
case
decided
by
this
court
i
think
in
280,
a
problem
came
up
under
the
agricultural
packers
and
stockyards
act
very
similar
statute,
very,
very
similar
to
the
natural
gas
act
where
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
fixing
the
prices
for
a
certain
merchandising
man
in
denver
stockyard
i
think
fixed
a
level
price
based
upon
his
analysis
of
the
entire
economics
of
the
thing
and
somebody
came
up
and
said
that
this
price
is
too
low
for
me
and
this
court
and
that
case
said
that
that
part
of
the
--
you're
not
guaranteed
a
profit,
you
don't
have
it
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
or
get
out
of
the
interstate
market.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
interstate
market.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
think
this
is
right.
i
think
that
it
is
more
of
a
theoretical
problem
than
anything
else
that
the
--
at
least
and
certainly,
the
very
high
cost
producer
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
his
cost
anyway.
this
is
not
surprising
justice
white
because
in
this
business
particularly,
you
will
have
lots
of
people
who
at
least
at
varying
times
are
not
making
a
full
return.
they
may
be
spending
all
their
money
in
investment
at
that
time.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
may
it
please
the
court.
just
before
the
recess,
we
were
discussing
what
we're
attempting
to
do
in
our
area
of
proceedings
and
the
question
that
would
come
up:
what
about
the
man
whose
cost
of
service
is
substantially
higher
than
the
price
that
the
commission
will
fix
in
any
given
area?
and
i
was
indicating
that
this
is
a
problem
which
the
commission
will
have
to
face
up
to.
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
justice
black,
that
there's
a
very
wide
distinction
at
a
minimum
between
a
cost-of-service
price
and
a
confiscation
price.
obviously,
in
a
cost
of
service,
there
are
many,
many
things
which
go
into
it
which
no
court
would
consider
in
determining
what
is
a
confiscation,
for
example
as
a
rate
of
return.
it's
hardly
confiscatory
if
a
man
selling
gas
doesn't
make
a
9%,
10%
or
11%
return
on
his
investments,
and
yet,
a
rate
of
return
would
go
into
a
cost
of
service
price.
but
there
will
undoubtedly,
and
let
me
stress
again
because
i
want
to
make
it
perfectly
clear,
whatever
the
old
commission
--
commission
that
decided
the
phillips
case
might
have
thought
about
area
pricing,
and
i
would
agree
there
are
certain
ambiguities,
if
you
read
the
commission's
decision
in
phillips
and
a
statement
of
policy,
both
of
which
were
on
the
record
here,
certain
ambiguities
about
the
language
there
exactly
as
to
what
they
intended
by
area
pricing.
it
could
be
argued
that
maybe
they
were
talking
about
contract
price,
field
price.
this
commission
is
basing
its
pricing
on
cost
considerations.
but
assuming
that
an
individual
producer
could
show
that
an
area
price
which
has
been
set
is
confiscatory
within
the
narrow
limitations
of
what
is
confiscatory,
and
it
could
show
that
this
was
not
because
of
carelessness
or
inefficiency
or
what
have
you
on
his
part,
but
because
he
just
hadn't
been
successful
in
this
business,
this
mining
business.
he
had
gone
around
and
attempted
to
get
gas
and
the
only
thing
he'd
gotten
finally
after
15
or
20
or
30
drilling
of
wells
was
a
little
trickle
of
gas.
i
think
there
are
grave
doubts
as
to
whether
this
court
would
say
because
a
man
on
his
15th
attempt
to
drill
for
a
well
has
gotten
a
little
trickle
of
gas
that
he
has
to
be
allowed
to
sell
that
gas
at
a
price
which
would
allow
him
in
and
there
to
recover
all
the
costs
he's
put
into
that.
that
isn't
the
nature
of
this
business.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
the
theory
of
area
pricing
does
concede
that
some
people
who
are
fortunate
or
efficient
will
get
more
than
on
a
cost
of
--
individual
cost-of-service
prices.
if
phillips
turns
out
to
be
an
efficient
producer,
it
is
possible
that
when
we
get
through
with
area
pricing,
the
prices
that
phillips
gets
would
be
somewhat
higher
than
company
x
would
get
--
no,
the
prices
will
be
the
same,
but
they
will
be
getting
more
than
they
would
be
getting
on
a
cost-of-service
basis,
whereas
company
x
which
we
can
assume
is
an
inefficient
producer
or
unlucky
producer
would
be
getting
less
than
they
would
be
getting
on
a
cost-of-service
basis.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission,
i
can
only
reiterate,
has
not
suggested
by
any
of
its
activities
in
the
area
of
proceeding
that
it
intends
to
fix
prices
by
the
field
prices
at
which
gas
is
being
sold
in
that
area.
i
cannot
tell
you
that
it
will
give
no
consideration
to
these
field
prices,
what
the
prices
at
which
gas
is
being
sold
in
that
area,
but
the
basic
intent
of
the
commission
is
to
fix
a
price
for
the
gas
based
upon
the
cost
and
economic
necessities
of
producing
and
bringing
gas
to
the
market
in
sufficient
quantities
so
that
it
will
serve
the
needs
of
the
consumers
at
the
cheapest
possible
prices
to
do
so.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
prices
for
example
in
a
given
field
--
when
you
say
price
is
hovering,
of
course,
you
recognize
that
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
and
that
is
not
we're
starting
out
to
do.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we're
starting
out
to
get
the
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
underlying
cost
and
to
apply
these
underlying
costs
to
the
problem
of
fixing
the
fair
price
here.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
have
for
example
in
the
permian
basin
case
--
now,
i
can
only
talk
about
the
staff
presentation
because
other
people
have
different
ideas.
we've
put
in
to
the
permian
basin
case
what
the
staff
has
determined
on
the
basis
of
extensive
questionnaires
and
information
that's
received.
what
is
a
cost
for
exploration
and
development?
this,
i
indicated,
is
a
national
cost.
i
don't
know
what
this
figure
is.
let's
say
it
is
3
cents.
a
cost
which
the
experience
in
the
industry
shows
that
they're
spending
per
mcf,
whatever
that
means,
of
gas,
to
do
sufficient
exploration
to
find
new
gas;
well,
that's
one
basic
cost.
there
are
other
costs;
the
operating
costs
of
lifting
gas
and
then
drilling
this
particular
area.
we
have
derived,
in
effect,
a
composite
cost
of
service
for
the
permian
basin.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
this
involves
no
consideration
of
actual
field
pricing.
now,
to
what
extent
in
determining
the
final
area
price,
the
commission
will
give
consideration
to
the
actual
field
prices,
whatever
that
means,
because
in
any
area
at
the
present
moment,
there
are
all
sorts
of
prices.
there's
the
price
of
the
new
gas
and
the
price
of
gas
sold
five
years
ago
and
the
price
of
gas
sold
10
years
ago.
i
cannot
assure
this
court.
i
can
only
say
that
everything
the
present
commission
has
done
since
it
took
over
this
business
and
has
been
pushing
to
get
these
cases
decided
indicates
that
their
primary
interest
is
setting
a
reasonable
price
based
upon
cost
and
economic
considerations
of
how
to
get
the
gas
produced
and
into
the
interstate
market
and
not
upon
contract
considerations
20
years
ago,
10
years
ago
or
even
today.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
now,
there
may
be
different
prices
for
different
types
of
gas.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there
are
some
--
one
of
the
great
problems
that
we
have,
which
is
an
issue
now,
is
to
whether
you
should
have
the
same
price
for
what's
known
as
gas
well
gas,
which
is
gas
produced
by
itself
and
a
casinghead
gas,
which
is
gas
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
that
comes
up
with
oil,
and
there
may
be
all
sorts
of
different
economic
indicia
as
a
result.
it
may
be
that
exploration
costs
and
needs
for
looking
for
gas
well
gas
are
entirely
different
from
dealing
with
gas
which
is
really
a
byproduct
of
oil.
these
variations
may
exist
but
we're
looking
to
set
a
price
for
a
type
of
gas
in
an
area.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
section
5
proceeding
as
to
phillips
was
dismissed
because
one,
the
commission
determined
that
it
could
not
determine
a
reasonable
price
for
the
future
using
the
individual
company
cost-of-service
basis
as
of
1960
on
the
basis
of
a
test
year
of
1954.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
--
that's
two.
that's
two.
it
determined
--
it
--
it
determined
in
its
discretion
as
of
1960,
and
i
say
that
because
i
think
its
discretion
as
of
1960
is
a
priori
as
of
1963,
but
it
determined
that
it
would
not
reopen
the
record
to
bring
it
up
to
date
and
to
then
try
to
figure
out
a
proper
rate
design
for
the
350
phillips
rights.
because
it
believed
that
this
would
be
a
time-consuming,
difficult
job
which
would
produce
results
which
you
didn't
think
were
very
useful
and
that
it
could
better
focus
its
time
and
attention
on
doing
what
it
did
think
was
useful,
and
that
is
putting
its
people,
people
who
are
experienced
in
the
commission
on
this
type
of
problem
to
work
as
hard
as
possible
to
get
the
area
rate
determinations
made.
now,
in
so
doing,
it
recognized
that
there
was
an
interim
period
and
it
did
establish
an
interim
program
which
had
been
described
here
this
morning
which
consisted
of
establishing
ex
parte,
no
hearing,
there
is
no
question
about
that
on
the
basis
of
expertise,
two
rates
in
each
area,
a
new
gas
rate
and
an
old
gas
rate;
the
old
gas
rate
was
for
increases
and
in
almost
all
cases
is
substantially
lower
than
the
gas
rate,
which
are
basically
holding
the
line
devices
because
it
recognized
there
was
an
interim
period
and
we're
told
that
there's
a
holding
of
line
device
that's
been
completely
ineffectual.
well,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
the
fact
is
that
just
this
period,
september
20,
1960,
does
constitute
a
watershed
in
which
prices
which
had
been
going
up
on
a
curve
which
were
all
too
high
have
not
--
have
gone
down.
and
prices
have
more
or
less
been
stabilized
in
one
or
two
areas.
we've
pointed
it
out
in
our
brief
that
the
price
for
october
of
1962
indicated
that
things
were
still
stabilized.
our
information
now
is
that
the
price
for
november
1962
was
identical
with
october
1962,
but
it
isn't
merely
a
stabilization
matter
because
in
this
last
18-month
period,
there
had
been
no
less
than
$30
million
of
refund
ordered
from
the
producers
to
the
pipelines.
this
is
hard
cash
going
back
to
the
pipelines
and
we're
all
going
back
further.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
what?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
these
were
of
two
types,
one
that
was
described
by
mr.
mann
as
a
result
of
section
7
proceedings
because
it
is
in
--
untrue,
your
honor,
that
our
initial
price
line
is
the
price
line
which
is
the
catco
price
line.
it
is
the
price
line
that
the
commission
will
act
but
anybody
who
wants
a
hearing
has
got
a
right
to
a
hearing
and
in
a
hearing,
these
prices
may
come
down.
in
the
skelly
hearing
mentioned
in
our
brief,
the
prices
came
down
as
much
as
2
or
3
cents.
in
the
catco
case
itself
they
came
down.
that's
one
way
refunds
come
back.
the
other
way
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
yes,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
don't
know
whether
there's
been
a
bond
for
refunds
in
phillips.
mr.
heady
i'm
sure
will
know,
but
they
are
--
there's
--
either
bonds
are
corporate
undertaking,
i
understand.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
first
of
all
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
first
of
all,
leaving
out
these
eight
rates,
we
are
deciding
those.
we're
moving
to
decide
phillips
as
fast
as
we
can
but
we're
doing
it
in
the
area
of
proceeding.
now,
this
isn't
quite
as
silly
as
it
sounds
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
all
these
rates
which
are
subject
to
refund,
they're
not
1954
rates.
all
these
rates
which
are
subject
to
refund
are
in
the
various
areas
of
proceedings
or
held
for
the
various
area
of
proceedings
and
when
we
decided
permian
basin
for
example,
that
involves
35%
of
phillips'
rates.
of
all
companies
--
of
all
companies
in
the
united
states
of
america,
phillips
is
probably
the
last
company
to
start
now
to
try
individual
company
rate
basis
because
it
so
happens
--
and
this
may
be
luck,
i
don't
know,
it
so
happens
that
35%
of
phillips'
rates
are
going
to
be
decided
as
to
refunds
and
as
to
the
future
in
this
permian
basin
case.
i
also
want
to
indicate
in
addition
to
$30
million
refunds,
in
addition
to
the
actual
price
line,
this
business
that
we
haven't
had
any
effect
is
not
true
for
another
reason.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
the
initial
price
line,
which
i
deny
was
the
highest
prices
in
each
area,
and
that's
perfectly
clearly
proved
by
the
eastern
seaboard
brief
itself
which
is
complaining
about
a
whole
bunch
of
prices
in
southern
louisiana
higher
than
this
price
line.
since
we
put
those
price
lines
into
effect
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
in
over
600
cases,
people
have
come
to
us
to
certificate
sales
of
gas
at
a
price
which
we
said
we
will
not
certificate
this
gas
at
this
price.
if
you
want
to
come
down
in
price
to
this
ceiling,
we'll
consider
certificating
it,
but
unless
you
come
down,
no
so.
now,
that
is
not
non-regulation.
that
may
not
be
the
most
perfect
regulation.
we
will
be
perfect
only
when
we
can
decide
the
area
of
prices,
but
we
have
not
gross
mistake
to
say
that
the
commission
has
abdicated
its
responsibilities
during
this
interim
period.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission
stated
that
they
were
based
upon
consideration
of
the
existing
prices
in
the
area
plus
their
knowledge
of
costs
and
other
economic
information
at
the
time.
i
think
with
all
due
respect
to
the
commission
at
that
time
that
it
is
true
that
serious
consideration
was
given
both
to
the
--
certainly
to
the
initial
prices
to
what
was
the
going
price
--
the
field
price
at
that
time.
but
it
was
not
the
highest
field
price.
the
initial
price
in
southern
louisiana
was
set
at
about
21.5
cents.
subsequently,
we
have
reduced
that
by
two
cents,
but
the
initial
price
that
the
commission
set
in
southern
louisiana
was
about
21.5
cents.
and
yet,
as
mr.
mann
points
out
in
his
brief,
there
were
a
lot
of
sales
in
southern
louisiana
at
23
cents.
similarly,
the
initial
price
in
the
texas
district
4
was
set
at
18
cents.
there
were
some
20-cent
sales
in
that
thing
but
we
didn't
use
them,
and
that
price
was
subsequently
cut
down
to
16
cents.
the
commission
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
commission
had
a
hearing
which
determined
what
the
prices
were
pursuant
to
the
catco
inline
rule
after
hearing
in
texas
district
4
as
of
september
28,
1960.
the
hearing
showed
that
the
prices
that
the
old
commission
had
set
at
18
cents
were
too
high,
so
the
commission
reduced
the
price
for
the
future
as
well
as
reducing
those
rates
which
were
involved
in
that
case.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that's
right.
there's
a
fifth
amendment
to
the
statement
of
general
policy.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
there's
a
fifth
amendment
which
happens
to
be
[laughter]
--
i
think
my
friend
from
phillips
would
agree
that
i
am
not
taking
the
fifth
amendment
that
he
is
taking.
we
have
amended
this
thing
as
time
to
time
goes
on
as
circumstances
have
indicated.
but
this
is
an
interim
program.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
final
program
is
not
what
we
can
do
to
hold
the
line.
the
final
program
is
the
area
rate
program,
the
cost-based
area
rate
program
to
fix
uniform
rates
for
the
same
type
of
gas
for
all
producers
in
the
various
areas
of
the
country.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
i
think
maybe
it
would
have
been
wiser,
as
you
will
note
in
the
recent
hunt
case
where
we
similarly
we're
not
able
to
make
any
decision
but
we're
sending
the
case
back,
we
sent
it
back
only
for
further
evidence
on
the
section
4
increased
rates
there,
but
we
didn't
dismiss
the
section
5
proceeding
and
of
course,
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
was,
that
we
were
well
aware
that
this
case
is
going
to
be
argued
at
this
time
and
that
it
would
be
foolhardy
to
dismiss
a
proceeding
which
this
court,
we
hope
not
but
might
order
us
to
go
ahead
with.
i
don't
know
why
the
court
dismissed
the
section
5
proceeding
rather
than
holding
it
in
advance.
what
i
think
--
well,
i
just
want
to
say
i
don't
really
think
it
makes
too
much
difference
because
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
i
don't
really
think
--
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
not
our
estimate.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
it's
not
judge
prettyman's
estimate
either.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
right.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
we
can
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
reinstitute
--
we
can
reinstitute
the
5
(a)
proceeding
tomorrow.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
yes,
we
can
--
we
can
reinstitute
the
section
5
proceeding
and
i
really
don't
think
it
makes
too
much
difference
whether
a
5
(a)
proceeding,
which
is
a
proceeding
for
future
is
suspended
or
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
we
can
reinstitute
it
and
if
the
commission
really
felt
that
we
could
reach
meaningful
decisions
on
an
individual
cost-of-service
basis
for
these
major
companies,
including
phillips,
we
really
felt
that
there
was
much
likelihood
of
doing
so
without
disrupting
our
continuing
efforts
to
do
what
we
think
make
sense,
i'm
sure
we
would.
basically,
what
you're
being
asked
to
decide
is
that
the
commission's
judgment
as
to
how
it
can
best
use
its
mind
power
and
spend
its
time
in
attempting
as
quickly
as
possible
to
get
nationwide
area
pricing,
whether
it
can
be
done
best
by
deciding
the
phillips
case
and
the
pan
american,
which
is
the
second
biggest
producer
and
hasn't
been
started
yet,
and
the
humble,
which
is
the
third
biggest
producer
and
hasn't
been
started
yet,
those
cases
on
an
individual
basis
or
whether
we
can
do
it
best
by
the
area
basis,
and
we
have
decided,
the
old
commission
decided
and
the
new
commission
still
believes
that
we
can
perform
this
difficult
task
best
by
the
procedure
we
have
adopted.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i
don't
think
you're
quoting
me
correctly
but
i
think
you're
right.
what
i
said
was
that
we
have
made
clear
that
in
area
pricing,
we
are
considering
costs,
but
i
want
to
go
on
and
say
that
the
question
came
up
during
the
course
of
the
permian
basin
case.
what
did
we
mean
by
saying
we're
considering
costs
and
the
commission
changed
its
mind
on
this,
to
be
perfectly
frank.
at
first,
the
question
came
up
by
some
of
the
producers
i
think
or
maybe
with
some
of
the
interveners,
can
we
introduce
cost-of-service
type
presentations?
and
at
first,
the
commission
said,
“no,
we
don't
want
any
cost-of-service
type
presentations.
we
just
want
cost
information
generally,”
but
the
present
commission
has
changed
this
and
it
has
said,
“we
don't
want
individual
company
cost-of-services,
but
if
you
think
it
is
useful
in
showing
us
how
an
area
price
can
be
done
to
introduce
composite
cost-of-service
of
analogous
type
companies,
come
ahead
and
do
so”
and
to
that
extent,
the
cost-of-service
principles,
but
considered
on
an
area
basis
are
involved.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no,
sir.
the
hunt
case
was
one
of
the
six
cases
--
seven
cases
which
i
mentioned
before.
it's
the
time
it
dismissed
phillips.
the
commission
thought
maybe
it
could
make
some
decisions.
first
of
all,
it
has
made
a
decision
on
phillips,
remember,
with
respect
to
the
section
4
aspects
of
the
case.
there
were
section
4
aspects,
increased
rate
problems
of
past
periods
involved
in
hunt.
also,
the
hunt
case
had
a
much
lighter
cost
test
year.
so
the
commission
in
hunt
and
in
gulf
and
a
number
of
these
other
cases
refused
to
terminate
the
case
at
that
time.
it
was
an
examiner's
decision
in
hunt.
the
examiner
filed
that
hunt's
cost-of-service
was
way
above
its
revenues
--
pardon
me,
above
its
revenues
that
we
should
dismiss
the
section
4
increased
rates
without
refunds
and
that
we
should
dismiss
the
section
5
proceeding
along
line
of
phillips.
when
this
came
before
the
commission,
the
commission
found
it
was
unable
to
make
any
determination
as
to
hunt's
cost-of-service
on
an
individual
company
basis
because
the
record
was
inadequate.
the
commission
might
have
dismissed
it
on
that
ground.
it
simply
said
to
hunt,
“you
haven't
shouldered
your
burden
or
proof
of
showing
these
increased
rates
were
justified.”
the
commission
didn't
feel
that
that
was
appropriate
in
view
of
the
fact
that,
one,
this
record
had
been
made
prior
to
phillips
when
there
were
no
guidelines,
and
two,
the
commission
had
refused
to
terminate
this
proceeding,
but
it
forced
hunt
and
everybody
else
to
go
ahead
with
it.
under
these
circumstances,
the
commission
has
remanded
this
case
to
give
hunt
an
opportunity
to
show,
if
it
can,
what
its
cost-of-service
was.
and
if
this
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
that
means
that
that
case
may
be
decided
on
the
cost-of-service,
and
so
may
a
number
of
the
other
cases.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
no
sir,
it
was
not
thought
impossible
to
do
it.
it
was
thought
unwise
to
do
it
because
they
would
--
because
of
the
fact
that
they
would
have
to
start
over
again
and
because
of
the
fact
they
thought
it
would
take
unnecessary
time
and
effort
to
do
so
away
from
moving
to
the
area
pricing
in
that
way.
now
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
the
hunt
remand
directs
the
examiner
to
allow
hunt
to
make
a
record
with
respect
to
the
section
4
proceeding.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
it
doesn't
terminate
the
section
5
proceedings
--
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
--
but
it
holds
them
in
suspended
animation.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
is
that
right?
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well
technically,
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
but
i
think
there
are
grave
doubts
as
to
whether
the
hearing
examiner
is
supposed
to
go
ahead
with
the
section
5
aspect
of
the
case
at
all.
mr.
richard
a.
solomon
well,
i'm
sure
--
i've
really
taken
too
much
of
my
colleague's
time,
but
i
suggest
that
whether
i'm
right
or
not,
it's
set
out
in
full
in
the
eastern
seaboard's
reply
brief
and
i
think
they're
just
holding
this
case
in
the
case
and
not
attempting
to
go
ahead
with
the
section
5
proceeding
at
this
time,
in
hunt
at
least.
