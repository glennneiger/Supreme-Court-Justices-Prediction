when
did
you
start
the
permian
basin
area
proceedings?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that'd
be
about
four
years?
justice
tom
c.
clark
do
you
have
23
areas?
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
there
are
more
producers
in
the
louisiana
area,
they
go
to
the
area
than
they
are
in
the
permian?
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
what's
the
percent
of
the
other
one?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it's
a
newer
field,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
its
potential
is
much
greater,
isn't
it?
justice
tom
c.

submerged
drilling.

justice
tom
c.
clark
do
they
have
a
posted
price
like
they
do
in
oil
or
gas?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
perhaps
your
company
might
like
it
does
in
oil,
post
a
price
at
which
it
might
buy
from
those
it
did
not
contract
with.
justice
tom
c.
clark
escalated
price,
i
wanted
--
if
you'd
tell
me
just
how
the
commission
then
goes
down,
we'll
say
into
the
permian
basin
and
how
do
they
arrive
at
area
price
on
the
permian
basin
that
are
in
those
three
cases,
we'll
take
just
one
case.
did
they
get
all
the
contracts
there
and
see
what
the
medium
is
or
just
(voice

justice
tom

clark
(voice

justice
tom
c.
clark
what
weight
do
they
give
the
going
price?
every
field
i
suppose
has
a
--
or
every
contract
has
a
going
price,
isn't
it?
so
what
weight
do
they
give
that?
you
say
they
take
the
cost
of
development,
and
everything?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
depends
on
the
cost
of
exploration,
production,
everything?
justice
tom
c.
clark
of
course,
some
exploration
must
--
most
expensive
as
you
indicated
like
in
the
gulf?
justice
tom
c.
clark
it
goes
in
with
the
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
shallow
areas
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
are
those
based
on
bonds?
have
they
given
bonds
for
refunds?
justice
tom
c.
clark
has
there
been
any
bond
for
refunds
in
phillips?
justice

[inaudible]
justice

that
would
not
be
necessary
in
the
4
(e)
cases
that
they
--
the
12
that
they
dismissed,
would
it,
that
they
were
superseded
by
later
filings?
justice
tom
c.
clark
that
couldn't
have
set
that
though
on
the
lock-in,
could
they?
i'm
asking
for
information,
i
don't
know
about
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
like
you
said,
the
one
that
--
that
superseded
it
is
too
high
or
too
low
even
with
the
same
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
the
remaining
4
(e)'s,
i
understood
mr.
bennett
you
to
say
there
are
about
a
hundred
filings
during
this
period?
justice
tom
c.
clark
what
happened
to
the
87
--
i
mean,
on
the
about
83,
wasn't
it?
no,
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
those
are
all
pending,
you
think?
most
of
those
are
pending?
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
determine
those,
would
they,
under
the
area
pricing
plan,
the
4
(e)'s,
wouldn't
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
to
see
that
they
do
that
for
their
future
under
the
5
(a)
but
i
was
wondering
how
they'd
do
it
under
4
(e).
justice
tom
c.
clark
how
many
areas
does
phillips
have?
justice
tom
c.
clark
would
you
participate
in
the
area
of
determination
geographically?
justice
tom
c.
clark
to
his
body?
justice
tom
c.
clark
thank
you.
