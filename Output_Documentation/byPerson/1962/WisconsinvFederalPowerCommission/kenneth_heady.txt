mr.
kenneth
heady
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
phillips
petroleum
company.
at
one
time
i
believe
phillips
was
the
principal
subject
to
these
proceedings.
we
have
heard
considerable
discussion
today
regarding
the
general
approach
of
the
commission
to
the
regulation
of
independent
producers.
i
would
like
to
turn
from
that
subject,
if
i
may,
and
to
direct
the
attention
of
the
court
to
the
specific
findings
which
the
commission
made
in
this
proceeding
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
it
and
to
the
disposition
of
this
case
which
the
commission
made
on
the
basis
of
those
findings.
in
particular,
i
want
to
address
myself
to
the
question
of
mr.
justice
harlan
with
respect
to
why
did
the
commission
dismiss
the
section
5
(a)
proceeding
and
to
the
second
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
goldberg
as
to
why
did
the
commission
dismiss
the
proceeding
rather
than
to
reopen
the
proceeding.
mr.
kenneth
heady
i
will
reach
that,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
heady
i
intend
to
discuss
the
record
pretty
much
in
its
entirety,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
kenneth
heady
no.
i
--
i
will
in
a
few
moments.
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
the
commission
made
four
basic
findings.
these
basic
findings
apply
both
to
the
section
5
(a)
proceeding
and
to
the
consolidated
section
4
(e)
proceeding.
these
basic
findings
were
at
first
that
1954
where
the
adjustments
for
known
changes
through
1956
constituted
an
appropriate
test
year
for
the
purposes
of
these
proceedings.
secondly,
the
commission
determined
that
for
that
test
year,
the
cost-of-service
determined
by
the
commission
was
almost
$9
million
higher
than
the
revenues
provided
by
the
contract
rates
including
these
consolidated
section
4
(e)
increases.
thirdly,
the
commission
determined
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
any
of
the
individual
contract
rates
were
under
the
discriminatory
or
preferential.
and
fourth,
the
commission
determined
that
this
record
was
inappropriate
for
the
purpose
of
determining
rates
for
the
future.
now,
each
of
these
basic
findings
is
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
none
of
them
were
challenged
in
the
various
applications
for
rehearing.
the
first
three
of
these
--
i
mean
or
three
of
these
findings
have
never
been
questioned.
the
only
finding
which
has
been
questioned
at
all
is
the
finding
relating
to
the
subject
of
discrimination
and
that
issue
was
raised
for
the
first
time
after
this
court
had
granted
certiorari.
for
the
moment,
let
me
deal
with
the
finding
that
this
record
was
inappropriate
for
fixing
rates
for
the
future.
to
do
that,
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
to
go
back
and
contrast
the
situation
of
this
case
as
it
was
presented
to
the
examiner
and
as
it
was
presented
to
the
commission.
it
became
obvious
relatively
early
in
these
proceedings
that
cost-of-service,
however
determined,
was
going
to
be
in
excess
of
the
contract
revenue.
now,
contrary
to
the
statements
of
mr.
bennett
and
mr.
brown,
phillips
was
not
advocating
cost-of-service.
we
had
gone
into
this
proceeding.
we
knew
that
we
were
going
to
be
met
with
a
cost-of-service
and
we
intended
to
deal
with
that
subject
as
best
we
could
by
meeting
them
on
common
ground.
certainly,
it
was
not
our
position
that
cost-of-service
was
the
only
way
in
which
this
case
would
be
decided.
now,
at
the
--
on
the
basis
of
the
cost-of-service
determined
by
the
commission,
it
was
apparent
as
i
say,
that
that
cost
was
going
to
exceed
the
revenue.
phillips
took
the
position
before
the
examiner
that
if
cost-of-service
was
to
be
the
sole
criterion,
then
under
those
circumstances,
phillips
was
entitled
to
contract
rates
which
would
return
that
cost-of-service.
consequently,
phillips
proposed
that
the
commission
set
aside
its
contract
rates
and
permit
it
to
charge
rates
higher
than
were
provided
by
its
contracts.
that
contention
raised
serious
objections
on
the
part
of
many
of
the
interveners.
the
examiner
touched
on
--
or
did
more
than
touch
upon
that
question.
if
you
will
turn
to
page
75
of
the
record,
you
will
see
there
the
beginning
of
a
rather
extensive
discussion
by
the
examiners
under
the
heading,
phillips'
right
to
section
5
(a)
increases
under
the
mobile-sierra
pacific
arguments.
the
examiner
determined
that
the
commission
was
entitled
to
and
should
set
aside
phillips'
contracts
and
permitted
to
charge
rates
higher
than
were
provided
by
its
contract.
but
in
the
sum
--
that
finding
then
was
the
basis
for
vigorous
exceptions
on
the
part
of
many,
but
not
all,
of
the
interveners
in
that
proceeding.
some
two
years
and
nine
months
elapsed
between
the
time
of
the
close
of
the
record
and
the
decision
of
this
case
by
the
commission.
during
that
interval
of
time,
many
of
the
contract
prices
provided
for
higher
rates,
many
of
the
contracts
were
renegotiated
to
provide
for
higher
rates.
consequently,
by
the
time
this
case
was
decided
by
the
commission,
the
issue
of
whether
the
commission
should
raise
phillips'
rates
above
its
contract
level
was
in
a
sense
moot
because
of
the
fact
that
by
that
time,
the
contract
price
is
already
provided
for
higher
rates.
and
this
was
the
significance,
i
think,
of
the
commission's
statement
at
page
324
and
325
of
the
record
in
which
the
commission
said
that
this
record
was
not
appropriate
for
fixing
rates
for
the
future.
the
commission
says
that,
“we
do
not
deem
inappropriate
or
require
that
phillips
file
rates
for
the
future
based
upon
the
present
record.”
the
significance
of
that
statement
was
that
it
made
little
sense
to
the
commission
to
undertake
--
to
set
aside
contracts
so
that
it
could
raise
rates
above
the
level
of
the
contracts
only
to
find
that
the
levels
to
which
it
had
raised
above
the
contract
were
then
below
what
the
contracts
were
providing.
consequently,
the
commission
said
that
on
the
basis
of
this
record,
it
makes
no
sense
in
reason
or
justice
to
attempt
to
fix
rates
for
the
future
on
the
basis
of
this
record.
now,
we
come
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
commission
should
have
dismissed
or
should
have
reopened
this
proceeding.
with
regard
to
that
question,
this
particular
proceeding
was
first
instituted
in
1948.
there
were
already
two
separate
and
lengthy
hearings
in
this
record.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
well
within
the
discretion
of
the
commission
to
say
that
we
are
not
going
to
continue
this
already
bulky
proceeding
and
reopen
it
for
the
receipt
of
new
evidence
instead
we
will
set
this
proceeding
down
for
a
new
proceeding.
now,
i
make
no
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
the
new
proceeding
ordered
by
the
commission
was
or
was
not
the
proper
type
of
proceeding.
that
i
leave
to
the
commission,
but
i
do
make
the
point
that
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
it,
the
commission
was
entitled
to
terminate
this
proceeding
and
go
forward
to
some
other
proceeding
and
that
the
findings
made
by
the
commission
did
support
that
decision.
now,
with
respect
to
the
4
(e)
proceedings,
the
commission
did
use
this
record
to
turn
--
to
determine
that
these
particular
section
4
(e)
increases,
had
determined
rates
less
and
provided
revenues
less
than
the
cost-of-service
while
they
were
in
effect
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
these
individual
rates
were
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
--
mr.
kenneth
heady
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
that
the
only
question
which
is
actually
before
this
court
was,
whether
or
not,
the
commission
was
entitled
to
terminate
the
section
4
(e)
proceedings,
and
i
emphasize
that
that
question
is
not
really
before
this
court
because
of
the
fact
that
in
the
applications
for
a
rehearing,
none
of
the
interveners,
none
of
the
present
petitioners,
attacked
and
challenged
the
commission's
finding
that
there
should
be
no
refunds
involved.
now,
there
was
one
exception
to
that,
that
one
exception
was
the
state
of
wisconsin.
wisconsin
in
its
application
for
rehearing
did
contend
that
there
should
have
been,
perhaps,
refunds
for
those
rates
which
are
in
excess
of
the
average
cost-of-service,
but
that
contention
was
urged
only
mildly
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
it
has
been
abandoned
here.
consequently,
i
question
whether
we
have
even
the
disposition
of
the
4
(e)
proceedings
properly
before
this
court.
that
--
but
in
substance,
i
agree
with
--
with
your
honor
that
that
is
the
only
basic
issue
which
is
involved
if
it
is
properly
here.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
these
basic
findings
of
the
commission
and
the
dismissal
of
this
proceeding
based
on
those
findings
do
not
directly
affect
any
future
proceeding
involving
phillips
or
any
other
producer.
under
section
5
of
the
natural
gas
act,
as
mr.
solomon
has
pointed
out,
the
commission
is
free
at
any
time
to
institute
a
section
5
investigation.
the
dismissal
of
these
proceedings
did
not
and
has
not
affected
that
power.
similarly,
with
respect
to
the
unconsolidated
section
4
(e)
proceedings,
those
proceedings
remain
pending
as
a
part
of
other
proceedings,
not
a
part
of
this
proceeding.
the
commission
has
in
fact
exercised
its
power
to
set
5
(a)
proceedings
by
ordering
a
5
(a)
proceeding
with
respect
to
phillips'
rates
in
the
permian
basin
area
and
the
south
louisiana
area.
it
could
this
afternoon,
so
far
as
phillips
is
concerned,
institute
an
order
with
respect
to
an
investigation
of
phillips'
rate
in
their
entirety.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
question
for
review
by
this
court
now
is
whether
these
basic
findings
of
the
commission
authorized
the
commission
to
dismiss
these
particular
proceedings.
the
future
proceedings
and
how
the
commission
should
conduct
itself
in
these
future
proceedings
is
to
me
not
properly
before
this
court.
it
is
simply
asking
this
court
to
exercise
advisory
administrative
powers
which
admittedly
this
court
does
not
have.
now,
with
respect
to
the
section
5
(a)
proceedings
and
the
dismissal
of
those
proceedings,
the
commission's
power
to
fix
rates
for
the
future
is
dependent
upon
the
finding
that
the
existing
rates
are
unjust
and
unreasonable
or
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential.
the
language
of
the
act
specifically
makes
that
finding
a
condition
precedent
to
the
fixing
of
rates
for
the
future
by
the
commission.
historically,
in
pipeline
rate
cases,
it
did
not
pose
any
particular
problem
because
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
has
generally
found
that
the
existing
rates
were
too
high.
the
commission
has
then
declared
those
existing
rates
to
be
unjust
and
unreasonable.
it
has
then
proceeded
to
prescribe
lower
rates
or
require
the
pipeline
company
to
file
lower
rates,
but
here,
the
commission
was
--
was
faced
with
the
opposite
of
the
usual
historical
situation.
it
was
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
revenues
were
less
than
costs.
no
one
now
contends
that
that
finding
which
is
unchallenged
obligated
the
commission
to
hold
that
the
existing
contract
rates
were
unjust
and
unreasonable.
the
commission
expressly
found
that
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
they
were
discriminatory.
under
these
circumstances,
no
one
challenged
the
commission's
finding
that
the
record
in
this
proceeding
was
not
appropriate
for
the
purpose
of
fixing
rates
for
the
future.
all
that
these
petitioners
did
in
substance
was
to
urge
an
application
for
rehearing,
that
the
commission
reopen
the
record
if
it
thought
that
this
present
record
was
inadequate.
but
that
objection
was
not
that
the
commission
had
failed
to
fix
rates
upon
this
rate,
but
that
the
commission
had
failed
to
provide
for
obtaining
a
new
record
in
which
new
evidence
might
be
obtained
and
that
that
new
proceeding
was
precisely
the
kind
which
these
petitioners
would
desire
to
have.
it
resulted,
--
so
far
as
the
section
5
proceedings
are
concerned,
the
commission
did
not
find
and
it
was
not
required
to
find
that
phillips'
existing
rates
were
unjust
or
unreasonable.
the
commission
did
not
find
and
it
was
not
required
to
find
that
phillips'
existing
rates
were
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential.
but
without
those
findings,
the
commission
had
no
power
over
these
proceedings
to
fix
rates
for
the
future.
the
fact
that
the
commission
permitted
the
existing
rates
to
stand
without
expressly
determining
that
these
existing
rates
were
just
and
reasonable
is
not
a
matter
of
any
significance.
this
court
made
it
clear
in
the
mobil
case
that
the
power
of
the
commission
is
simply
the
authority
to
review
rates
established
in
the
first
instance
by
the
natural
gas
companies
being
regulated
and
to
set
aside
or
modify
only
those
rates
which
it
determines
to
be
unjust
or
discriminatory.
a
rate
once
having
been
reviewed
by
the
commission
and
not
having
been
found
to
be
unlawful,
stands
on
its
own
and
is
not
dependent
upon
any
affirmative
finding
of
the
commission
that
that
rate
is
just
and
reasonable.
now,
the
court
also
made
it
clear
in
the
mobil
case
that
to
this
extent,
there
is
no
difference
between
section
4
and
section
5.
this
principle
applies
to
both
of
those
sections.
in
actuality,
the
petitioner's
contentions
that
the
commission
should
have
reopened
this
record
are
--
are
nothing
but
pleased
to
the
discretion
of
the
commission.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
eastern
seaboard's
contentions
are
just
that.
i
don't
think
they
have
ever
gone
further
than
--
than
to
contend
that
this
was
a
matter
of
discretion.
in
their
view,
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
nevertheless
they
have
treated
it
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
as
i
pointed
out,
so
far
as
the
--
as
the
section
4
(e)
proceedings
are
concerned,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
commission's
findings,
its
basic
findings
are
as
applicable
to
those
as
to
the
5
(a)
proceedings
with
this
one
difference.
the
commission
there
did
decide
that
--
and
specifically
the
question
of
refunds.
it
determined
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
cost-of-service
was
in
excess
of
the
revenues
and
the
fact
that
the
existing
rates
were
not
shown
to
be
discriminatory,
that
there
was
no
basis
on
which
to
attempt
to
order
refunds
of
those
section
4
(e)
increases.
now,
the
commission
did
point
out
that
since
those
increases
have
been
superseded
by
later
increases
and
therefore
were
no
longer
in
effect
and
that
the
later
superseding
increases
were
the
subject
of
other
and
separate
pending
section
4
(e)
proceedings
that
this
record
was
not
an
appropriate
place
in
which
to
attempt
to
establish
future
rates
for
these
section
4
(e)
proceedings.
it
seems
to
me
that
on
--
on
the
basis
of
its
finding
in
this
proceeding
that
the
commission
did
precisely
the
only
thing
it
could
do
with
respect
to
this
section
4
(e)
proceeding
and
that
was
to
hold
that
no
refunds
were
required
and
that
these
particular
section
4
(e)
proceedings
should
be
dismissed.
with
regard
to
the
hunt
case,
which
has
been
discussed
here
to
some
extent,
one
contention
made
by
the
petitioners
here
is
that
that
case
holds
that
the
mere
fact
that
total
cost-of-service
exceeds
total
revenue
may
not
always
be
relied
upon
to
sustain
individual
rate
increases.
that
finding,
of
course,
was
based
upon
the
record
in
the
hunt
case.
whatever
findings
and
whatever
decisions
the
commission
may
have
made
on
the
basis
of
the
hunt
case
so
far
as
this
record
is
concerned,
the
commission
did
hold
that
the
mere
fact
that
an
overall
cost-of-service
exceeded
the
total
revenue
did
justify
these
particular
increases
because
of
one,
the
fact
that
cost
exceeded
revenues
and
secondly,
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
the
individual
rates
were
discriminatory.
the
commission
was
not
required
to
make
any
further
inquiry
so
far
as
phillips
was
concerned.
perhaps
for
hunt,
i
don't
know
what
the
record
showed
in
that
proceeding.
there's
one
other
matter
regarding
these
section
4
(e)
increases
that
might
bear
some
slight
discussion.
one
other
attack
was
made
upon
these
--
on
three
of
these
section
4
(e)
increases
by
california.
these
contract
provisions
provided
that
the
--
whenever
the
wholesale
commodity
index
had
increased
by
a
prescribed
number
of
points
and
the
purchaser
from
phillips
had
obtained
a
general
increase
in
its
rates,
then
phillips
was
entitled
to
a
proportionate
increase
in
its
rates,
proportionate,
that
is
to
the
increase
received
by
the
pipeline
company.
these
are
the
clauses
which
california
designates
as
the
so-called
spiral
escalation
clause.
california
nowhere
contends
that
these
increases
were
not
justified
by
phillips'
cost.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
three
increases
involved
were
to
levels
which
were
less
even
than
the
average
unit
cost-of-service
determined
by
the
commission.
california's
contention
is
simply
that
the
mere
existence
of
these
contract
provisions
in
some
way
violated
some
unstated
public
policy
and
that
the
commission
should
have
rejected
these
increases
without
even
considering
the
question
of
whether
the
increases
were
required
or
justified.
california
never
states
precisely
why
it
is
that
the
mere
existence
of
these
contract
provisions
should
violate
some
public
policy,
especially
in
view
of
the
fact
that
any
increase
provided
by
them
must
be
justified
on
other
grounds.
now,
california
in
its
brief
seems
to
be
attempting
to
create
the
impression
that
the
commission
allowed
these
increases
merely
because
of
the
contract
provisions.
but
quite
to
the
contrary,
all
that
the
commission
did
was
to
consider
these
contract
provisions
authorized
phillips
to
utilize
the
rate
filing
procedures
of
section
4.
that's
all
that
the
commission
considered
that
these
provisions
did.
phillips
was
required
to
justify
these
contract
provisions
on
other
grounds.
to
that
extent,
the
commission
treated
these
contract
provisions
no
differently
than
any
other
contract
provisions.
in
this
instance,
the
commission
determined
that
these
particular
increases
were
justified
on
the
basis
of
phillips'
cost
and
california
has
never
contended
otherwise.
certainly,
there
is
no
public
policy
which
would
require
or
even
permit
the
commission
to
ignore
these
contract
provisions.
in
fact,
california
seeks
a
retroactive
amendment
which
would
deny
phillips
the
right
to
file
an
increase
to
which
it
is
admittedly
entitled.
these
particular
provisions
have
been
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
similar
or
--
provisions
providing
for
indefinite
increases
at
indefinite
times
had
been
upheld
by
other
circuits
and
in
fact
by
this
court.
it
would
have
been
obviously
a
clear
error
under
those
circumstances
for
the
commission
to
have
rejected
these
increases.
in
summary,
let
me
say
that
--
mr.
kenneth
heady
because
of
the
fact
that
the
commission
found
that
the
total
contract
revenues,
including
these
particular
increases
provided
revenues
less
than
the
cost-of-service
and
the
fact
that
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
any
individual
contract
rate
was
discriminatory.
now,
california
has
not
challenged
either
of
those
findings.
it
seems
to
me
that
none
of
those
circumstances,
calor
had
--
calor
--
oh
california
has
admitted
the
findings
of
the
commission
that
those
rate
increases
were
justified.
the
position
of
california
--
mr.
kenneth
heady
california
has
never
challenged
and
did
not,
in
its
application
for
rehearing,
challenged
the
commission's
finding
that
cost-of-service
exceeded
revenues
for
the
test
year
nor
did
it
challenge
the
position
that
the
rates
were
not
shown
to
be
discriminatory.
let
me
say
one
thing
further
with
respect
to
the
test
year.
the
argument
is
made
that
the
test
year
doesn't
establish
anything
with
regard
to
later
year,
but
that
finding
overlooked
--
that
contention
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
commission
found
that
the
1954
test
year
with
adjustments
was
representative
for
the
purposes
of
this
proceeding.
and
that
effect
and
by
that
finding,
the
commission
has
in
effect
found
that
the
1954
test
year
was
representative
of
all
of
the
periods
that
these
particular
contract
increases
were
in
effect
--
mr.
kenneth
heady
those
increases
in
revenues
are
subject
to
later
section
4
(e)
proceedings,
which
were
not
a
part
of
this
proceeding,
no
evidence
was
introduced
with
respect
to
--
they
could
--
there
could
have
been
no
decision
in
this
record
with
respect
to
those
increases.
that
matter
of
course
occurs
in
any
time,
even
with
a
pipeline
company.
mr.
kenneth
heady
that
this
proceeding
--
mr.
kenneth
heady
was
inappropriate?
mr.
kenneth
heady
the
commission
very
carefully
states
that
the
1954
test
year
was
appropriate
for
the
purposes
of
this
decision.
now
--
mr.
kenneth
heady
they
--
they
--
they
have
used
it
to
the
extent
of
the
4
(e)
proceedings.
and
in
fact,
the
commission
has
said
that
the
1954
test
year
was
appropriate
for
the
purpose
of
testing
the
4
(e)
increases.
they
did
go
on
and
say
that
the
1954
test
year
was
not
appropriate
for
the
purpose
of
fixing
rates
for
the
future
either
in
the
section
5
(a)
proceeding
or
the
section
4
proceeding.
mr.
kenneth
heady
that
and
the
fact
that
the
contract
provision
has
changed
in
the
meantime
and
the
issues
presented
to
the
commission
were
different
than
those
presented
to
the
examiner.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
heady
no,
your
honor.
the
commission
--
as
i
read
the
commission's
decision,
specifically
decided
that
the
4
(e)
increases
were
justified
and
that
no
--
no
refunds
were
required.
mr.
kenneth
heady
it
ends
the
refund
chances
with
respect
to
the
12
particular
section
4
(e)
increases
which
were
consolidated
with
this
proceeding.
the
balance
of
the
increases
which
were
filed
during
and
after
this
hearing
and
this
proceeding
remained
the
subject
of
pending
proceedings
there
will
be
perhaps
an
opportunity
for
refund
in
those
proceedings.
mr.
kenneth
heady
that's
for
future.
well,
that's
for
future
proceedings
for
determination
--
mr.
kenneth
heady
no,
your
honor.
your
--
your
question
assumes
that
the
commission
terminated
the
4
(e)
proceedings
because
it
could
not
decide
it.
the
commission
did
decide
--
mr.
kenneth
heady
--
the
section
4
(e)
--
mr.
kenneth
heady
it
has
cut
off
that
chance
to
get
a
refund
because
of
the
commission's
findings
that
the
increases
were
justified.
mr.
kenneth
heady
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
