does
it
appear
on
what
basis
the
lines
of
an
area
were
established?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
i
would
suppose,
the
geography
of
an
area
would
be
then
important,
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
geography
which
comprises
an
area
would
be
quite
important,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
the
parties
in
those
proceedings,
are
they
heard
on
the
definition
of
the
merit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
ambiguity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
probably
if
an
area,
the
price
is
possibly
around
these
figures
or
maybe
some
higher
or
some
lower,
but
they
cluster
around
some
particular
figure.
you
just
suggested
that
this
will
not
be
conclusive
upon
the
commission.
but
how
--
how
the
commission
is
going
to
ignore
that
in
the
area
of
pricing
business?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'm
thinking
of
the
old
techniques
that
the
wage
stabilization
board
and
the
opa
follow
when
they,
for
very
different
reasons,
had
to
determine
going
prices
for
a
given
job
in
a
given
area
or
going
prices
for
a
particular
commodity.
that's
the
old
cluster
technique
as
i
recall
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i'm
not
saying
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
heard
you
say
that
but
you
haven't
told
me
how
you're
going
to
do
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
involves
no
consideration
of
actual
field
pricing?
