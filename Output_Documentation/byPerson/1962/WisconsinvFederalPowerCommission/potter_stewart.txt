what
--
where
do
this
14
year
figure
come
from,
that's
used
throughout
the
briefs,
i
wondered
who
does
--
what
that
was
or
what's
the
significance
of
the
14
years?
justice
potter
stewart
your
position
that
the
commission
is
required
to
consider
rates
on
a
cost
basis
exclusively?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
section
4?
justice
potter
stewart
and
these
were
so-called
locked-in
base?
justice
potter
stewart
they
had
been
superseded
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
by
filing
the
higher
rate.
justice
potter
stewart
many
areas,
are
there,
as
determined?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
going
to
be
on
averaging
operation,
an
averaging
process
though,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
comes
up
with
oil.
justice
potter
stewart
in
their
field.
justice
potter
stewart
upon
what
--
upon
what
foundations
were
the
two
sets
of
prices
in
the
statement
of
general
policy
based?
justice
potter
stewart
under
what
procedure
is
that
price
been
cut
down
to
16
cents?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
as
to
--
as
to
new
filings
of
prices
in
that
field,
the
--
the
--
the
price
will
be
different
from
--
from
that
in
the
statement
of
general
policy
and
the
commission's
opinion
on
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
a
what?
justice
potter
stewart
with
respect
--
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
hunt
case,
i'm
looking
at
your
brief
on
the
top
of
page
42.
it
said
that
--
i
read
that
as
implying
that
the
hearing
examiner
is
just
supposed
to
sit
on
the
5
(a)
aspect
of
the
hunt
case
pending
this
area
pricing
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
remands
them
--
justice
potter
stewart
technically,
it
remanded
that,
as
i
suppose
to
the
hearing
examiner
too,
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
--
that
was
my
interpretation
reading
that
--
that
little
portion
of
the
opinion
on
the
top
of
your
--
of
page
42
of
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
that
you've
just
stated
is
the
only
question
really
before
us,
isn't
it?
the
validity
of
the
new
proceeding
is
not
really
before
us.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it,
you
--
you
would
concede
that
it
couldn't
have
--
have
made
a
decision
on
the
merits
in
the
5
(a)
proceeding
on
the
present
record,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
inadequate
--
inadequate
final
foundation
for
any
decision
on
the
merits
5
(a).
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
you
to
say
that.
i
want
to
be
sure
--
