mr.
kent
h.
brown
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
present
for
review,
a
september,
1960
determination
by
the
federal
power
commission
which
is
affirmed
by
a
divided
court
below
upon
the
basis
of
several
fundamental
misconceptions
of
its
import
and
of
its
ramifications.
by
its
determination,
the
commission
for
the
second
time
in
a
decade,
declined
to
apply
the
heart
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
phillips
petroleum
corp
--
company,
the
largest
independent
producer
of
natural
gas,
supplying
over
10%
of
the
interstate
market
and
to
fix
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
its
sales.
in
a
1951
determination,
the
commission
had
declined
to
do
so
under
the
erroneous
impression
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
over
sales
by
producers
to
interstate
pipelines.
that
was
reversed
by
the
court
below
in
1953
with
a
remand
order
which
specifically
directed
the
commission
to
proceed
to
fix
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
all
of
phillips
interstate
sales.
in
june
of
1954,
this
court
affirmed.
with
that,
the
commission’s
responsibility
was
twofold.
first,
it
was
duty
bound
to
proceed
with
this
batch
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
the
courts.
secondly
and
equally
importantly,
it
was
duty
bound
to
take
steps
promptly
to
stabilize
producer
rates
and
charges
in
the
interim,
pending
the
completion
of
its
first
task.
as
will
be
shown
for
six
years
owing
1954,
it
did
neither
and
those
charges
soared.
belatedly,
following
six
successive
court
of
appeals
adjournments
that
this
court
meant
what
it
said
in
1959
in
the
catco
case
about
the
commission’s
duty
to
stabilize
and
to
hold
the
price
line,
pending
the
determination
in
the
instant
phillip
rate
case.
the
commission
did,
in
1960,
give
a
form
of
lip
service
to
the
duty
to
stabilize,
at,
i
point
out
immediately,
1959
and
1960
levels,
not
1954
levels.
it
flatly
refused
however
in
the
instant
determination
to
perform
its
foremost
function
and
that
is
why
we,
who
have
put
on
the
penalty
for
the
commission’s
procrastination
and
will
continue
to
do
so
for
the
foreseeable
future,
are
here
today
again
as
a
last
resort.
upon
receipt
of
the
remand
order
in
1954,
the
commission
entered
an
order
vacating
its
prior
determination
of
the
investigative
proceedings
it
had
instituted
in
1948
against
phillips.
it
did
nothing,
however,
by
way
of
scheduling
the
matter
for
hearing
and
two
years
elapsed
during
which
time,
phillips
exercising
its
prerogative
under
section
4
of
the
natural
gas
act
filed
successively
12
increases
in
particular
sales
which
under
section
4
may
be
suspended
for
a
maximum
of
five
months
after
which
they
go
into
effect
virtually
automatically.
finally,
in
1956,
the
commission
entered
an
order
consolidating
those
12
rate
increase
proceedings
with
the
pending
section
5
investigative
future
ratemaking
proceeding
and
scheduled
both
as
consolidated
for
hearing
beginning
june
of
1956.
the
hearings
proceeded
and
were
terminated
in
december
of
1957.
during
the
course
of
the
presentation,
there
were
four
separate
cost-of-service
studies
presented
to
the
examiner,
carefully
analyzed,
cross-examined
by
all
parties.
all
used
the
1954
as
the
test
year
adjusted
to
take
into
account
known
changes.
15
months
later,
on
april
6,
1959,
the
examiner
rendered
a
most
exhaustive
analysis
of
the
record
and
his
recommendations,
for
futu
--
fixing
the
phillips
future
rates.
before
analyzing
the
examiner's
decision,
i
would
digress
momentarily
to
record
developments
during
the
interim
and
the
date
of
this
court's
order
of
remand
and
1959,
the
date
of
the
examiner's
initial
decision.
first,
the
period
was
marked
by
a
multitude
of
section
4
rate
increase
filings
by
phillips
and
by
others
developing
into
what
has
come
to
be
called
a
pancaking
process;
namely,
a
rate
increase
for
one
sale
is
filed,
it
goes
into
effect.
it
is
in
effect
subject
to
investigation
which
is
never
instituted,
settlements
included.
finally,
the
company
will
file
another
increase
for
that
same
sale
which
goes
into
effect
and
supersedes
the
first
increase.
this
is
the
pancaking
process.
this
was
done
by
phillips
and
enormous
amounts
of
money
were
collected
by
it
subject
to
refund
under
section
4
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
period
was
also
marked
by
a
study
upward
spiral
of
similar
nature
in
the
initial
prices
for
gas,
new
gas
dedications.
the
commission's
rationale
for
permitting
of
this
was
in
those
days
it
would
investigate
the
propriety
of
those
prices
in
subsequent
section
5
proceedings
like
this
one
should
be
instituted
against
each
major
producer.
they
were
instituted
against
virtually
all
of
the
major
producing
industry.
the
period
was
also
marked
initially
by
a
concerted
refusal
on
the
part
of
producers
in
the
section
4
and
section
5
cases
that
the
commission
instituted
to
disclose
in
any
way
shape
or
form
their
costs
of
operation.
their
representation
was
that
the
cost-of-service
method
of
regulating
independent
producers
was
impractical,
impossible
or
worse
and
their
theme
was
hammered
to
the
point
of
redundancy.
the
commission
at
this
time
and
the
producers
were
aligned
in
congressional
pursuits,
seeking
congressional
exemption
of
the
producing
industry
from
the
impact
of
the
natural
gas
act
or
at
minimum,
outlawing
the
use
of
cost-of-service
as
a
method
of
evaluating
and
testing
their
rates,
both
efforts
failed.
finally,
during
the
period,
there
were
two
several
marked
decisions
by
the
courts
below
and
the
fifth
circuit
holding
in
substance
the
cost-of-service
was
of
necessity,
at
least
the
starting
point,
the
commission
must
use
in
order
to
evaluate
any
rates
of
any
utility
subject
to
its
jurisdiction.
coming
back
to
the
examiner's
decision,
he
first
noted
the
criticism
of
the
feasibility
of
the
cost-of-service
approach,
but
noted
also
that
it
had
been
rendered
in
a
vacuum
in
that
up
until
his
decision,
there
had
been
no
opportunity
for
applying
or
endeavor
to
apply
the
traditional
means
of
evaluating
the
rates
of
an
independent
producer,
his
was
the
first
attempt.
during
the
proceedings,
phillips
and
all
of
the
party's
participants
had
proceeded
upon
the
assumption
that
of
the
course
this
was
the
process
that
would
be
utilized
to
evaluate
phillips'
rates.
phillips
found
no
difficulty
in
the
presentation
of
the
case.
parties
who've
submitted
other
cost-of-service
found
no
difficulties
in
the
presentation
of
the
case.
the
examiner
exhausted
--
exhaustively
analyzed
each
of
the
four
cost-of-service
matters
submitted
to
him
and
concluded
that
phillips'
cost-of-service
for
the
test
year
1954
was
$57
million
which
translated
in
terms
of
a
per
unit
cost-of-service
of
11.6
cents
per
mcf
of
gas
sold.
he
also
found
that
for
1954,
test
year
revenues
apart
from
any
increases
subsequently
filed
were
$45
million
resulting
in
a
deficit
operation
on
the
surface
for
that
particular
test
year.
he
directed
phillips
to
file
calculated
rates
for
all
of
its
1954
sales
for
continuing
to
produce
the
requisite
11.6
cents
per
mcf
average
revenues
for
those
sales,
thus
supplying
phillips
with
the
full
return
of
its
entire
cost-of-service.
and
incidentally,
cost-of-service
as
i
use
it
here
always
includes
a
fair
return
upon
the
actual
expenses
and
the
actual
operations.
he
also
directed
that
phillips
filed
similar
rates
for
all
of
its
then
current,
continuing
sales
which
would
have
the
effect
of
increasing
sum.
phillips'
sales
at
that
time
ranged
from
one
cent
per
mcf
to
as
high
as
23
cents
per
mcf
depending
on
a
particular
sale.
his
direction
would
have
produced
a
schedule
of
rates
ranging
from
say
10
to
15
cents
per
mcf
for
all
of
those
sales.
hence,
some
would
have
forced
--
have
been
increased
many,
a
great
bulk
of
this
rate
increase
filing
subsequent
to
1956.
iis
range
as
i've
indicated,
the
23
cents
would
have
been
reduced.
phillips
submitted
after
the
examiner's
decision
was
rendered
a
schedule
of
rates
which
as
i've
indicated
started
with
a
maximum
of
15
cents
and
tapered
down,
indicative
that
the
direction
was
quite
feasible.
mr.
kent
h.
brown
in
1959
sir.
a
year
and
a
half
later,
in
september
1960,
the
commission
issued
its
opinion
in
this
long
awaited
initial
determination
of
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
producers.
its
opinion
like
the
examiner
starts
off
with
an
analysis
of
the
theory
of
regulation
of
independent
producers
and
unlike
the
examiner,
however,
deals
with
the
numerous
representations
of
impracticality,
endorses
the
representations
wholeheartedly
and
finds
the
system
of
cost-of-service
analysis
for
independent
producers
not
a
feasible
means
of
fixing
their
rates.
preferring
to
adopt
and
test
such
rates
on
an
entirely
new
process
of
evaluation
of
the
operations
of
producers
in
specified
areas
of
the
country
and
fixation
of
an
even
level
of
rates
for
all
gas
served
or
sold
in
that
area,
it's
called
by
all
producers,
area
ratemaking
process.
simultaneously
with
that
pronouncement
of
preferred
process
which
as
i've
pointed
out
was
an
entirely
noble
one,
the
commission
issued
its
statement
of
general
policy
number
61-1
in
which
it
defined
and
prescribed
23
separate
areas
of
the
country
and
pulling
them
out
of
the
thin
blue
air,
if
you
please,
this
promulgation
was
without
notice,
without
hearing,
without
evidence,
prescribed
two
levels
of
rates
for
each
of
the
23
areas
with
decimal
precision.
the
first
group
was
to
be
a
guide
to
the
commission
in
the
certification
of
new
gas
dedications
under
section
7
and
an
indication
to
the
applicant
of
whether
he
might
anticipate
receiving
an
unconditional
certification
if
his
price
was
below
that
for
the
area
fixed
in
the
statement,
or
a
conditioned
certificate
confining
him
to
the
area
of
initial
price
level,
absent
a
demonstration
of
why
he
should
have
more.
the
second
group
of
prices
was
prescribed
for
guidelines
in
evaluating
rate
increase
files.
by
that,
a
rate
increase
filed
under
section
4
below
the
prescribed
level
would
according
to
the
commission
not
be
suspended
or
subjected
to
an
investigative
proceeding.
if
it
was
above
the
prescribed
rate
increase
level,
it
would
be
suspended
and
subjected
to
a
section
4
process.
now,
the
evolution
of
those
prices
was
a
complete
enigma
initially,
but
since
the
commission
has
made
it
perfectly
plain
that
they
were
in
substance
for
initial
prices,
the
then
going
line
for
new
gas
dedications
in
1959
and
1960.
for
the
section
4
line
was
in
effect
a
weighted
average
of
the
gas,
price
of
all
gas
being
delivered,
at
that
time,
in
that
particular
area
of
the
country.
these
were
to
be
the
guides
that
the
commission
would
use
in
evaluating
section
7
and
section
4
applications.
it
made
it
perfectly
plain
also,
however,
that
it
had
no
intention
of
denominating
them
as
just
and
reasonable
or
that
they
were
to
be
used
for
evaluating
anything
that
under
that
standard
in
the
section
4
or
section
5
cases.
it
was
to
provide
a
guideline
per
the
mandate
of
this
court
in
catco
to
hold
the
line,
to
stabilize
the
price
level
while
they
evolved
just
and
reasonable
rates
in
the
pending
section
5
cases
which
have
been
instituted
against
major
producer.
the
commission
went
on,
however,
to
here
say
that
this
case
have
been
presented
to
it
on
a
cost-of-service
basis
and
with
the
only
means
by
which
it
could
evaluate
it
and
proceeded
to
do
so
in
precisely
the
same
manner
as
had
the
examiner,
and
if
you
please,
emerge
to
the
cost-of-service
less
than
that.
the
examiner
had
described
and
found
nearly
$54
million
for
the
1954
test
year
which
average
is
11.1
cents
per
mcf
reach
of
phillips
1954
sale.
however,
having
done
so,
it
then
refused
and
declined
to
adopt
the
examiner's
recommendation
and
to
proceed
in
the
manner
in
which
everyone
had
anticipated
that
it
would
i.e.
the
exercise
of
section
5
duties
and
fixed
prescribed
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
phillips
then
pending
and
future
sales.
it
said
first
that
it
knew
that
phillips'
costs
had
increased
between
1954
and
1960.
and
that
the
1954
test
year
was
presumably
stale
and
it
would
be
a
result
without
reason
to
fix
--
purport
to
fix
phillips'
future
rates
in
1960
on
the
basis
of
a
1954
test
year.
it
refused,
however,
to
its
--
it
so
felt,
remand
the
matter
to
the
examiner
for
an
updating
of
the
test
year,
saying
that
instead
of
doing
so,
it
would
dismiss
and
terminate
the
section
5
investigative
proceeding
entirely
and
await
the
evolution
of
area
rates
and
area
ratemaking
proceedings
to
be
instituted
later
and
fix
phillips
and
all
other
independent
producers'
just
and
reasonable
rates.
at
the
conclusion
of
those
investigative
proceedings
which
were
anticipated
to
consume
or
require
at
least
another
decade.
the
section
4,
proceedings,
the
rate
increase
proceedings
which
had
been
superseded
as
to
which
the
interest
was
primarily
involving
the
necessity
for
phillips
to
affect
refunds
of
any
excess
over
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
the
period,
the
commission
pointed
to
the
deficiency
that
it
found
for
1954
and
presumed
that
that
deficit
status
continued
through
1958,
the
year
in
which
these
particular
12
section
4
cases
were
superseded
by
even
higher
ones
and
hence,
dismissed
that
--
those
proceedings
as
well.
the
commission
knew,
it
indicated
in
its
opinion
that
it
was
cognizant
that
there
were
pending
before
it
at
that
time,
some
95
to
100
separate
rate
increase
filings
made
by
phillips
through
the
period
1956
through
1960
that
were
not
technically
encompassed
and
consolidated
in
the
pending
proceeding
from
which
it
knew
that
in
1960,
phillips
was
deriving
revenues
of
approximately
$90
million
of
which
--
and
of
these
it
took
pride
purportedly
of
which
the
commission
said
82%
or
$70
to
$74
million
of
phillips'
total
revenues,
jurisdictional
revenues,
were
being
collected
under
section
4
suspension
cases
subject
to
refund.
this
was
the
means
by
which
the
commission
said,
“we
are
able
to
protect
the
public
as
to
these
tremendous
increases
pending
the
evolution
of
area
rates
to
emerge
from
proceedings
we
will
start
subsequent,
just
the
fact
that
they're
being
collected
subject
to
refund,
$70
million
of
the
$90
million
for
revenues
of
that
year.
yet
the
commissioner
refused
to
remand
to
the
examiner
for
consideration
of
those
rates
and
the
analysis
of
them
in
the
light
of
the
standards
of
section
5
and
section
4,
i.e.
are
they
just
and
reasonable,
unjust
or
discriminatory
and
as
to
the
latter,
i
repeat,
phillips'
rates
ranged
from
1
cent
per
mcf
for
some
sales
to
23.5
cents
per
mcf
for
many
others.
the
commission
said
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
discrimination
in
this
record,
hence
there
was
no
basis
for
activity
under
that
aspect
of
section
4
and
section
5
and
dismissed
the
whole
kit
and
caboodle.
the
court
below
upon
review
of
the
determination
sustained
the
commission
by
a
two-to-one
vote.
it
first
analyzed
the
situation
in
terms
of
the
1954
to
1959
period
during
which
the
particular
rates,
section
4
rates
subject
to
review
were
analyzed
--
were
in
fact
and
concurred
with
the
commission
in
its
surmise
that
the
deficit
operation
continued
through
1958,
at
least.
it
then
analyzed
the
period
after
the
forthcoming
area
rate
proceedings
and
made
some
remarks
about
privy
of
that
endeavor
which
was
of
course
were
wholly
premature
in
that
we
do
not
know
yet
and
we
will
not
know
or
as
the
court
below
said,
“at
least
four
to
14
years.”
what
if
anything
will
emerge
from
any
of
the
pending
area
ratemaking
endeavors?
mr.
kent
h.
brown
it
is
taken
from
the
words
of
judge
prettyman
below
writing
for
the
majority,
where
he
found
it,
i
do
not
know
sir.
the
court
returned
to
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
case,
however,
i.e.
what
it
called
the
present
rates,
meaning,
the
rates
that
were
now
in
effect
in
1960,
were
in
effect
in
1960
and
those
that
will
continue
to
be
in
effect
as
increased
by
phillips'
first
contractual
obligation
to
do
so
anytime
for
this
period
of
four
to
14
years
or
whatever
it
is
that
we
await
the
evolution
of
the
area
rates.
although
the
commission
itself
contemplated
no
control
during
this
period,
the
court
below
recognized
that
some
form
of
interim
regulation
was
requisite
and
said
that
the
commission
could
use
the
sgp,
the
statement
of
general
policy
price
levels
for
not
only
testing
the
validity
or
propriety
of
service
propriety
of
applications
under
section
47
for
new
sales
and
section
4
rate
increase
purposes
but
in
testing
the
propriety
of
existing
rates
in
section
5
proceedings,
in
that
the
court
was
in
error.
first,
the
commission
did
not
so
intend
those
figures.
secondly,
it
will
be
entirely
impossible
for
so
to
utilize
them
because
they
were
nothing
but
products
of
fiat.
how
can
you
direct
a
producer
to
reduce
his
rates
in
the
basis
of
the
comparison
with
the
figure
of
that
nature?
so
finally,
the
use
of
those
figures
would
produce
nothing
but
fair
field
price
basis
for
testing.
judge
fay,
he
dissented
in
which
he
pointed
out
that
the
area
ratemaking
process
was
only
in
the
offing
that
in
the
interim,
a
regulation
of
some
nature
was
required
and
he
felt
that
on
this
record,
the
commission
could
adequately
do
so,
as
it
had
itself
demonstrated
by
the
exercise
of
the
individual
company
cost-of-service
process
and
fixed
rates.
if
there
were
any
deficiencies
in
the
process
and
we
are
not
here
advocating
that
there
are
not,
there
are
imperfections,
ratemaking
is
not
a
precise
science,
but
it
has
been
done
for
50
years.
it
has
the
process
that
is
only
that
is
known
to
the
law
at
this
juncture
as
being
entirely
legal
and
lawful.
it
is
the
one
the
commission,
i
submit,
was
required
to
proceed
under
and
apply
unless
and
until
it
evolved
in
adequate
substitute.
it
could
not
dump
the
ship
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
and
let
us
all
float
out
to
the
ocean.
our
principal
legal
contentions
on
that
subject
are
to
precisely
that
effect,
namely
the
commission
we
feel
was
duty
bound
and
obligated
to
proceed
with
this
batch
in
1954
to
carry
out
the
mandate
of
this
court
to
fix
just
and
reasonable
rates
and
its
high
time,
it
was
done.
thank
you
very
much
your
honors.
