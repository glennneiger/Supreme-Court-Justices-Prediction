mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioners
for
whom
i
appear
here
in
no.
74,
the
long
island
lighting
company,
philadelphia
electric
company
and
the
united
gas
improvement
company
have
participated
actively
in
this
case,
commencing
with
the
first
day
of
its
trial.
they
have
this
position
in
this
proceeding
at
this
point.
first
of
all,
they
do
not
contend
that
the
federal
power
commission
must
regulate
only
on
a
company
by
company
cost-of-service
basis
or
for
that
matter
indeed,
on
any
other
specific
basis.
they
do
believe,
however,
that
the
commission's
choice
among
methods
does
not
include
the
method
to
do
nothing
in
the
way
of
fixing
lawful
just
and
reasonable
rates
under
the
act
and
at
this
point,
i
would
direct
my
thought
to
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
to
mr.
bennett.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
we
have
here
is
not
your
honor,
whether
ultimately
the
commission's
area
rate
approach
is
going
to
prove
to
be
workable
and
if
so,
to
what
extent?
the
problem
we
have
here
is
that
we
need
something
which
is
workable,
which
is
lawful
and
which
can
positively
be
applied
during
the
time
when
the
commission
with
our
help,
i
trust,
can
workout
a
more
useful,
workable
method
such
as
that
which
it
now
proposes
under
its
area
rate
approach.
so
that
as
far
as
the
companies
for
whom
i
speak
here
are
concerned,
we
simply
contend
that
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
commission
because
the
commission
did
abuse
its
discretion
and
that
it
acted
irresponsibly
and
in
utter
disregard
of
the
court's
mandate,
that
it
fixed
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
phillips.
this
is
an
important
landmark
case.
i
will
remember
that
when
mr.
heady
and
others
and
i
were
working
on
this
case
in
1957,
we
looked
upon
it
as
a
case
in
which
we
were
hopefully
helping
the
commission
to
establish
truly
workable
methods
of
regulation.
the
industry
looked
to
this
case
as
a
solution
to
many
of
its
longstanding
problems.
they
looked
to
the
commission
to
come
up
with
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
a
method
for
finding
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
phillips.
the
commission
did
not
do
this.
it
did
not
comply
with
this
court's
mandate.
as
judge
fahy
put
it
and
as
other
counsel
had
pointed
out,
judge
fahy
said,
“it
came
so
close
to
doing
what
it
said
it
should
not
do
as
to
demonstrate
that
it
is
able
to
do
what
it
has
failed
to
do.”
now,
this
inaction,
we
contend
on
the
part
of
the
commission,
is
in
error
for
two
reasons.
one,
on
a
general
policy
industry
important
point
of
view,
it
has
left
the
industry
and
the
public,
including
the
consumers
most
especially
in
the
lurch.
it
has
left
us
to
regulation
under
what
is
little
more
than
a
fair
field
price
standard.
with
respect
to
the
error
of
the
commission
as
it
regards
phillips
itself,
as
mr.
brown
pointed
out
initially,
the
commission
disregarded
entirely
some
$22
million
being
collected
annually
by
phillips
in
some
95
section
4
(e)
cases
that
were
pending
before
it
but
which
were
not
consolidated
with
its
proceedings.
it
ignored
also
the
fact
that
even
if
it
took
only
phillips
1954
sales
but
priced
them
on
a
1960
basis,
the
result
would
have
indicated
revenues
some
$6.5
million
in
excess
of
a
cost-of-service.
this
is
to
say
nothing
of
the
new
sales
of
gas
which
phillips
by
that
time
was
making.
another
thing,
this
court
will
recall
as
presented
to
it
in
numerous
proceedings
including
the
catco
case
and
as
was
before
it
in
the
transco-seaboard
proceeding
which
was
sent
back
to
the
commission
under
per
curiam
remand
that
at
the
time
of
this
case,
we
were
confronted
with
numerous
23.5
cent
gas
prices
in
south
louisiana.
in
one
of
its
orders
involving
the
transco-seaboard
proceeding,
the
commission
assured
us
with
respect
that
one
of
phillips
sales
that
is
made
from
the
so-called
tigre
lagoon
field
in
south
louisiana
that
it
--
although
it
resulted
from
two
triggering
of
favored-nation
increases,
starting
with
8.5
cents,
going
up
to
23.5
cents,
the
commission
assured
us
in
its
order
that
we
would
be
protected
against
this
kind
of
thing.
this
too,
the
commission
ignored
when
it
dismissed
phillips'
section
5
and
finally,
as
i
have
said
before
and
this
other
counsel
has
pointed
out,
the
commission
did
ignore
this
court's
mandate.
it
also
disregarded
its
own
order.
when
a
commission
set
this
proceeding
down
for
rehearing,
when
it
reinstituted
its
section
5
investigation,
its
orders
specifically
said
that
it
was
going
to
determine
whether
any
of
phillips'
rates
was
unjust
and
unreasonable
and
accordingly,
it
was
going
to
fix
phillips
rates.
i
suggest
to
you
that
it
was
not
possible
for
the
commission
to
comply
if
it
did
not
look
at
all
of
phillips
rates,
how
could
it
possibly
have
determined
whether
any
of
them
was
unjust
or
unreasonable.
it
simply
looked
at
the
12
consolidated
section
4
(e)'s
before
it
and
then
terminated
the
section
5.
the
court
below,
when
it
reviewed
this
matter,
treated
the
case
as
it
has
been
outlined
by
mr.
bennett.
and
then
importantly,
it
seems
to
me
from
the
standpoint
of
where
we
find
it
today,
recognized
that
the
commission
had
to
carry
out
some
sort
of
an
interim
regulatory
program.
justice
prettyman
admitted
that
interim
protection
while
the
commission
is
in
the
process
of
carrying
out
its
area
experiment
has
got
to
be
brought
about.
he
said,
however,
and
this
it
seems
to
me
is
the
fatal
error
of
the
decision.
he
said
that
the
commission's
general
policy
statement
rate
levels
were
themselves
just
and
reasonable.
now,
the
respondent,
the
federal
power
commission
has
never
itself
contended
that
this
is
so.
the
commission
has
never
contended
that
the
general
policy
level
which
it
has
prescribed
are
just
and
reasonable
rates.
they're
simply
guideline
rates
and
yet,
by
holding
them
as
just
and
reasonable
and
holding
that
because
he
believed
them
just
and
reasonable,
they
were
sufficient
as
standards
under
which
the
commission
could
operate.
judge
prettyman
and
the
court
below
erred.
the
respondent's
position
since
the
time
of
the
argument
in
the
court
below
has
changed
most
substantially.
as
mr.
bennett
has
pointed
out,
its
decision
in
the
hunt
case,
opinion
365
which
appears
as
the
appendix
to
our
reply
brief,
really
amounts
to
a
confession
of
error
on
the
part
of
the
commission
which
we
also
discuss
in
our
reply.
in
paraphrasing
the
opinion
365
in
hunt,
and
this
appears
at
page
12
of
our
reply
brief,
the
respondent
has
concluded
that
the
use
of
individual
company
cost
as
a
method
for
determining
whether
an
independent
producer's
increased
rates
are
just
and
reasonable
appears
to
be
necessary,
if
it
is
to
pass
upon
such
rates
at
all
prior
to
the
establishment
of
area
rates.
i
say
also
accordingly
it's
necessary
under
the
gas
act
to
determine
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
hunt's
increased
rates
by
its
individual
cost,
updating
them
if
necessary
to
do
the
job.
they
say
it
is
necessary
under
the
act
to
determine
whether
hunt's
increased
rates
are
unduly
discriminatory
or
preferential,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
its
overall
revenues
are
supported
by
overall
cost.
and
finally,
they
say,
it
may
prove
necessary
under
the
act
to
test
the
lawfulness
of
hunt's
non-refundable
rates
in
the
course
of
passing
on
its
increase
rates
and
for
that
reason
they
hold
open
hunt's
section
5.
despite
these
admissions
and
departure
from
its
previous
position
as
set
forth
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
is
contained
in
its
papers
in
opposition
to
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
respondent
still
contends
that
its
opinion
338
should
be
affirmed
and
they
set
forth
several
reasons
for
this
which
i
would
like
to
discuss.
first,
they
say
that
they
are
really
doing
a
creditable
job
of
protecting
the
consumers
through
the
application
of
their
general
policy
statement
price
level
through
settlements
and
through
the
use
of
their
section
4
suspension
and
refund
powers.
let's
consider
these
reasons.
first,
as
to
the
suspension
and
refunds,
phillips
in
1960,
still
was
collecting
some
$22
million
annually
subject
to
refund.
they
were
collecting
$3
million
annually
over
the
old
gas
ceiling
which
had
been
--
have
been
imposed
by
the
commission
in
the
several
areas.
nationally,
some
$158
million
annually
is
being
collected
with
accruals
to
date
of
about
three
quarters
of
a
billion
dollars.
this,
it
seems
to
me,
reflects
a
position
completely
inconsistent
with
the
position
taken
by
the
commission
in
its
brief
in
the
tennessee
case
and
which
was
reflected
by
agreement
of
this
court
in
its
order
and
opinion
in
number
48
handed
down
in
which
it
pointed
out
that
refunds
certainly
afford
the
consumer
no
protection.
secondly,
the
general
policy
statement
levels
which
the
commission
is
using
as
has
been
pointed
out,
these
are
nothing
more
than
field
price
levels.
the
new
gas
ceilings
are
the
highest
prices
which
prevailed
in
1960.
the
old
gas
levels
are
simply
the
average
of
all
prices
which
prevailed
at
the
end
of
1959.
now,
we
do
not
have
data
on
the
nation
as
a
whole
but
with
respect
to
south
louisiana
which
is
so
important
in
the
gas
supply
particularly
of
the
eastern
seaboard,
the
gas
coming
from
south
louisiana
and
this
is
discussed
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
6
and
also
in
our
appendix
to
our
reply
brief
at
page
28.
some
94%
of
the
gas
moving
in
interstate
commerce
out
of
south
louisiana
in
1960
exceeded
the
old
gas
ceiling,
70%
of
it
was
over
the
inline
price
ceiling
which
was
suggested
by
this
court
in
its
catco
opinion
and
55%
is
even
over
the
new
gas
ceiling
of
21
and
a
quarter
cents
in
south
louisiana.
we
submit
that
this
not
protection
for
the
consumers.
finally,
as
to
the
third
vehicle
the
commission
is
using
namely
the
settlements.
it
points
with
some
pride
to
the
fact
that
they
have
resulted
in
refunds
of
$5.8
million
in
annual
reductions
and
$3
million
in
future
rates.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
rather
shocking
for
the
reason
that
all
of
the
cases,
out
of
which
to
the
$5.8
million
and
the
$3
million
spring
are
cases
which
were
sent
back
to
the
commission
by
remands
from
this
court
in
catco
and
transco-seaboard
by
the
d.c.
circuit
in
the
hope
case
and
by
the
fifth,
ninth
and
tenth
circuits.
it
is
out
of
the
remands,
if
you
please,
of
cases
in
which
the
commission
originally
certificated
a
23.5
cent
price,
which
because
of
the
pressure
of
the
courts
have
been
reduced
and
it
is
those
cases
which
result
in
the
refund.
as
for
as
settlements
of
rate
cases,
there
have
been
only
a
few
and
significantly,
they
have
been
brought
about
because
of
the
fact
that
in
those
cases
examiner's
findings
or
staff
evidence
of
cost-of-service
have
been
submitted.
these
three
reasons,
i
submit,
are
not
sufficient
to
justify
the
commission's
going
forward
with
its
area
rate
experiment
without
any
interim
providing
the
consumer
with
some
sort
of
lawful
protection.
we
suggest
that
the
method
it
used
in
this
case
itself
in
deciding
to
dismiss
the
section
4,
the
method
it
has
used
in
hunt
and
the
method
which
its
examiners
have
used
is,
while
perhaps
not
the
very
best
method
in
the
world,
certainly
a
lawful
method
and
a
method
which
it
can
and
should
use
until
such
time
as
we
all
know
whether
the
area
experiment
is
going
to
bear
fruit.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
mr.
mann,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
respond
first
to
mr.
solomon's
suggestion
that
the
real
question
here
is
whether
the
commission
should
be
compelled
to
go
down
two
roads
simultaneously.
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
question
is
whether
the
commission
may
refuse
to
go
down
any
road
during
the
time
while
its
area
rate
experiment
is
in
progress,
whether
it
can
in
fact
abandon
a
known
road
simply
because
it's
rocky
in
favor
of
an
unknown
road
which
has
not
even
been
chartered.
while
this
experiment
goes
forward,
and
i
would
remind
the
court
again
that
the
companies
for
whom
i
speak
are
not
opposed
to
the
commission's
going
forward
with
its
area
rate
experiment.
they
are
actively
engaged
and
presumably
will
continue
to
assist
the
commission
in
its
efforts
in
this
regard,
but
while
the
experiment
is
in
progress,
while
it
is
going
forward,
refundable,
bonded
dollars
are
being
collected
at
the
rate
of
$158
million
annually,
$
22
million
of
those
dollars
are
phillips'.
now,
mr.
solomon
suggests
that
the
commission
is
basing
regulation
on
a
cost-of-service
basis
and
indeed,
it
is
in
part
as
is
reflected
by
its
own
evaluation
of
the
examiner's
decision
here
and
its
own
opinion
338
in
this
case,
as
it
has
reflected
in
the
hunt
decisions,
which
are
before
you,
opinions
365
and
369,
as
it
is
already
going
forward,
at
least
it's
--
did
in
the
permian
basin
procedure.
the
commission
does
indeed
recognize
the
need
for
some
relationship
between
the
revenues
of
a
company
and
its
income
or
--
and
it's
--
and
it's
requirements
in
terms
of
revenue.
the
commission
recognizes
the
need
for
cost.
the
problem
is
not
that.
it's
that
the
commission
refuses
to
go
forward
on
a
company
by
company
basis.
and
in
accordance
therewith
is
unable,
we
contend,
and
i
think
properly
so
to
give
us
any
kind
of
interim
protection
while
its
experiment
is
going
forward.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
think
that
we
–
to
answer
the
question
in
several
ways,
first
of
all
recognize
that
phillips
petroleum
company
itself,
this
single
company,
represents
10%
of
the
jurisdiction
of
gas
being
sold
in
this
country
today.
it
represents
alone
as
much
gas
as
being
considered
in
the
entire
permian
basin
proceeding,
so
it
is
important.
now
secondly,
as
far
as
time
is
concerned,
indeed
it
did
take
time
to
try
this
case.
we
started
back
in
1957
and
the
record
was
long,
and
there
were
many
false
starts.
the
parties
who
participated
in
this
proceeding
had
many
suggestions
to
make
as
to
how
to
proceed.
the
examiner
sit
through
the
week
[inaudible]
in
--
in
a
--
in
an
extraordinarily
patient
and
capable
way.
the
commission
then
considered
this
and
the
commission
resolved
many
of
these
issues
so
that
in
consequence,
a
great
deal
of
ground
had
been
plowed
in
this
proceeding.
and
indeed,
the
--
the
--
the
ground
plowing
that
has
been
done
here
by
the
examiner
has
been
followed
by
other
examiners
and
they
have
learned
their
lessons
from
this.
the
commission
has
in
consequence
in
the
--
in
the
proceedings
in
which
the
company
by
company
approach
has
been
used
and
we
list
them
incidentally,
some
of
them
in
our
appendix
a,
a
great
deal
of
progress
has
been
made
and
much,
much
less
time,
in
my
opinion,
would
be
required.
and
third
and
finally,
if
this
is
a
relative
matter,
if
it's
a
matter
of
relating
how
much
time
is
going
to
be
required
to
finish
this
case
at
long
last
on
the
one
hand
as
compared
with
going
forward
on
the
area
approach
and
conceivably
by
mid-1964
finding
the
rates
for
the
permian
basin
procedure
--
producers,
35%
of
phillips'
gas
being
there.
if
it's
a
relative
thing,
i
would
point
out
that
many
of
the
legal
issues
which
are
going
to
be
involved
in
the
commission's
decision
of
the
first
area
price
proceeding
are
going
to
be
long
and
complex
and
complicated.
now,
this
is
not
necessarily
to
condemn
it,
but
simply
to
say
that
it
is
that
kind
of
question
which
it
seems
to
me
we
will
not
get
if
the
commission
here
decides
the
phillips
case
on
a
company
by
company
basis.
the
discrimination,
confiscation
argument
which
mr.
justice
black
discussed
with
mr.
solomon
this
morning,
one
of
the
--
one
of
the
virtues
of
a
--
of
a
company
by
company
approach
is
that
at
least
it
enables
the
commission
the
examining
authority
to
weigh
and
evaluate
all
of
the
costs
of
the
company
on
the
one
hand
and
all
of
its
revenues
on
the
other.
then
by
prescribing
or
first
letting
the
company
come
in
with
a
schedule
of
rates
to
return
that
cost-of-service,
there
may
be
some
positive
assurance
that
the
company
is
at
least
recovering
its
cost-of-service.
that
is
--
that
is
one
of
the
very
important
major
benefits
and
advantages
of
the
company
by
company
approach,
which
incidentally
poses
a
very
serious
problem
in
the
area
price
proceeding.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
well,
certainly
mr.
justice
black,
the
record
in
this
case
would
indicate
that
it
takes
a
good
while
and
i
think
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
the
major
cases,
it
will
take
some
time.
but
again,
it's
a
relative
matter.
i
cannot
say
to
you
in
complete
honesty
that
it's
going
to
take
any
less
time
to
do
it
on
an
area
basis.
in
fact,
it's
my
own
personal
judgment
it
may
well
take
more
time
to
reach
the
commission
decision
level
following
which
we
will
have
a
many
unknown
legal
questions
that
are
going
to
have
to
be
resolved.
secondly,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
well,
i
find
that
question
rather
difficult
to
answer.
i
would
say
that
it
has
been
my
experience
that
the
pricing
of
gas
in
the
field
has
been
based
pretty
much
on
--
on
what
the
market
will
bear.
now,
at
the
moment
of
january
1963,
and
this
--
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
that
is
--
that
is
right,
sir.
the
pipelines
have
had
a
tremendous
demand
for
gas.
they
have
gone
in
to
the
field
and
each
time
they
seek
either
to
construct
a
new
line
or
to
expand
an
existing
pipeline,
they
require
a
substantial
major
block
of
gas.
they
go
into
the
field,
they
find
its
gas.
and
it
has
been
their
experience
in
the
past
that
each
time
they
do,
and
this
by
the
way
is
in
your
catco
decision.
i
think
this
is
fully
discussed
there,
each
time
they
do,
the
gas
price
simply
reaches
a
new
higher
plateau.
so
that
in
sum,
i
would
say
that
the
experience
in
the
marketplace
and
the
field
has
been
that
gas
seeks
to
be
sold
in
a
seller's
market
and
any
pipeline
which
seeks
to
buy
it
is
going
to
have
to
pay
or
even
buy
a
major
block
of
gas.
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
at
least
as
much
as
or
slightly
more
than
the
last
highest
price
in
the
area.
i
would
respond
incidentally
to
mr.
justice
goldberg
with
respect
to
the
producer
cases
which
are
listed
in
our
appendix
a
of
the
brief
which
are
a
number
of
the
major
cases
on
which
substantial
work
has
been
completed
and
would
respond
to
mr.
solomon
by
saying
with
respect
to
humble
and
pan
american,
which
are
i
believe
number
two
and
three
or
three
and
two
in
the
list
following
phillips
in
size.
it
is
indicated
very
clearly
there
that
the
field
investigation
of
these
producers
has
been
completed.
and
if
the
lessons
which
have
been
learned
in
this
case
could
be
applied
to
those
cases
and
the
other
cases
listed
in
that
appendix,
it
seems
to
me
there
certainly
could
be
very
rapid
progress
to
be
made
and
more
importantly
still,
the
results
which
would
be
obtained
could
be
used
by
the
commission
and
applied
in
fixing
prices
by
areas.
what
is
needed
most,
if
the
court
please,
is
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
the
commission
has
yet
to
fix
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
any
major
producer
in
the
country
and
that
is
where
we
have
to
start.
that
is
what
is
needed
and
we
trust
that
the
commission
will
be
asked
to
come
to
grips
with
this
matter
in
this
case
and
decide
it
so
that
we
may
have
at
long
last
a
just
and
reasonable
rate.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
i
think,
mr.
justice
black,
there
may
be
no
difference
between
us
as
to
why
the
commission
did
it.
the
difference
we
have
is
in
--
is
in
the
extent
of
its
propriety.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
the
commission
did
it
on
the
merits
as
applied
only
to
the
cost
of
service
for
1954
related
to
the
12
section
4
(e)
cases
that
were
then
before
it.
it
did
not
come
to
grips
with
the
real
problem
that
it
had.
it
did
not
come
to
grips
with
the
problem
which
this
court
told
that
it
had
and
told
it
to
grapple
with
namely
to
fix
phillips'
rates,
with
all
of
them.
it
in
effect
did
nothing
more
than
put
in
action,
let
the
--
actually,
it's
10
of
the
12
section
4
(e)
rate
stand.
it
did
not
fix
phillips'
rates
and
so
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
i
would
concede
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
record
was
stated
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
i
think
--
i
think
--
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
i
think
that
it
--
it
is
true
that
whatever
the
commission
did
with
that
record,
it
did
have
to
update
it.
i
think
the
record
--
the
record
was
so
long
in
the
making
that
it
did
have
to
be
updated,
and
we
urged
the
commission
to
update
it
and
in
our
application
for
rehearing,
for
example.
we
--
we
call
to
the
commission's
attention
facts
which
it
did
know
and
which
were
before
it
to
point
out
precisely
why
it
had
to
be
updated.
but
if
it
didn't
update
it,
it
was
simply
closing
its
eyes
to
the
reality
of
phillips'
gas
prices
and
also
was
ignoring
the
court's
mandate
to
fix
phillips'
rates.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
they
--
they
were
all
superseded
by
later
filings,
mr.
justice
clark,
but
i
believe
the
one
i
mentioned
to
you
this
morning
points
up
the
kind
of
thing
that
could
happen
and
did
happen
and
might
well
have
happened
in
connection
with
the
other
section
4
(e)
then
pending
but
not
consolidated,
namely
that
even
though
the
particular
proceeding
before
the
commission
represented
an
increase
which
let
us
say
fell
below
the
cost
level
line,
they
were
--
and
accordingly
was
locked
in,
if
you
will,
there
were
subsequent
increases
in
the
case
i
cited
this
morning,
the
one
to
23.5
cents,
which
clearly
was
above
and
beyond
all
reason
and
above
the
catco
inline
level
--
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
they
--
they
could
have
disposed
this
one
and
all
the
others
had
it
update
the
new
record.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
i
think
what
would
have
happened,
and
again,
perhaps
i'm
speculating,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
what
would
have
happened
and
what
we
suggested
would
be
an
appropriate
approach
would
be
for
phillips.
once
it
knew
the
cost-of-service
which
it
was
entitled
to
collect
for
phillips
to
submit
to
the
commission
for
its
initial
examination
a
schedule
of
rates
covering
all
of
its
sales
designed
to
return
that
cost-of-service,
our
position
being
that
phillips
first
of
all
is
in
the
best
position
to
do
this
because
of
its
knowledge
of
its
contractual
relationships.
and
secondly
that
it
is
a
convenient
starting
point
and
does
the
least
amount
of
damage
to
existing
market
relationships
as
among
the
producers
on
the
one
hand
and
the
pipelines
on
the
other.
and
i
think
that
in
the
process
of
this,
prices
like
this,
23.5
cent
price
would
have
sorted
out
very
nicely.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
there
--
there
were
--
they
were
pending
before
the
commission
on
september
28,
1960
i
believe,
your
honor,
95
--
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
well,
many
--
many
of
those,
mr.
justice
clark,
are
still
pending.
in
addition,
there
have
been
others
which
have
been
filed
and
of
course,
there
are
also
before
the
commission,
and
i
don't
know
how
many
of
these,
there
are
several
so-called
initial
price
rates,
which
have
been
filed
which
are
at
high
levels
above
the
commission's
area
prices
or
inline
levels.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they're
--
they're
pending
and
to
a
certain
extent
are
susceptible
to
the
kind
of
protection
that
is
available
under
the
--
under
the
refund
and
bonding
provisions
of
the
act,
which
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
--
in
this
number
48
this
term
just
gives
the
consumer
no
protection
at
all
because
of
the
transitory
nation
of
the
population.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
i
--
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
be
the
commission's
hope
that
it
could
do
this.
it's
--
it's
--
it's
hoped
that
it
can
be
done.
and
--
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
the
difficulty
--
the
difficulty
would
be
that
--
let
us
say
they
do
find
a
--
a
just
and
reasonable
rate,
now
assuming
the
--
the
lawfulness
of
it,
assuming
they
find
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
the
permian
basin,
this
represents
only
a
portion
of
phillips'
sales.
now,
that
would
mean
that
until
they
had
made
similar
determinations
of
“just
and
reasonable”
rates
in
other
areas,
they
would
not
be
able
to
fix
the
total
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
phillips.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
i
suppose
most
all
--
all
areas
would
be
my
--
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
did
i
participate?
no,
sir,
mr.
justice
clark,
those
were
--
those
were
done
simply
by
the
commission.
the
--
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
that
is
right.
there
was
no
--
there
was
no
hearing.
i
think
that
this
was
done,
as
i
understand
it,
upon
the
commission's
understanding
and
appraisal
of
the
various
geological
structures,
as
well
as
geographic
areas
and
upon
the
experience
reflected
by
the
data
in
his
file.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
the
answer
to
the
second
part
of
the
question,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
is
no,
it
does
not
tell
the
--
it
did
not
tell
the
commission
how
to
exercise
it,
but
i
would
invite
your
attention
to
pages
405
and
those
following
of
the
record,
and
i
would
quote
from
the
opinion
commencing
at
the
bottom
of
page
405,
“therefore…”
--
and
this
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
at
point
--
“therefore,
phillips
is
a
natural
gas
company
within
the
meaning
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
commission
should
fix
the
rates
at
which
these
sales
are
made.”
and
then
if
you
were
to
look
also
at
the
commission's
order
reinstituting
the
investigation
--
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
that
is
--
that
is
right.
yes,
sir
and
this
--
this
court
of
appeals
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
--
by
this
--
by
this
court
on
june
7,
1954.
mr.
j.
david
mann,
jr.
particularly,
your
honor,
during
the
time
between
now
and
such
time
in
the
future,
as
the
commission's
area
experiment
may
--
and
we
hope
prove
to
be
successful,
but
we
just
do
now
know
and
nor
do
we
know
whether
it
will
be
two,
four
or
14
years,
but
it
certainly
is
going
to
be
a
protracted
period
and
it
is
for
this
period
that
we
are
especially
concerned.
thank
you.
