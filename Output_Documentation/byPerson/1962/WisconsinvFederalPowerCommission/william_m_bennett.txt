mr.
william
m.
bennett
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
national
importance.
it
can
be
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
a
mere
one
cent
increase
in
the
price
of
the
volumes
of
gas
delivered
in
interstate
commerce
amounts
to
$80
million
increase
annually
across
the
nation.
so
far
as
california
is
concerned,
our
gas
bill
exceeds
$300
million
a
year.
we
are
dependent
primarily,
almost
totally
upon
the
el
paso
natural
gas
company
for
our
gas
which
we
obtain
from
out
of
state
sources
and
in
turn
el
paso
is
the
largest
single
customer
of
the
phillips
petroleum
company.
this
case
has
a
long
and
almost
a
discouraging
history
to
it.
the
court
of
appeals
below,
following
the
mandate
of
this
court,
in
the
phillips
decision
specifically
directed
that
the
commission
should
fix
the
rates
for
phillips
and
it
hasn't
been
done.
a
proceeding
was
opened
pursuant
to
that
mandate
and
pursuant
to
sections
4
and
5
among
others
of
the
natural
gas
act.
and
this
is
not
that
type
of
case
in
which
the
commission
has
discretion
to
open.
this
case
was
opened
because
it
was
directed
to
be
opened
by
this
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
below
to
find
out
the
way
to
regulate
producers
for
the
protection
of
the
consumers
of
the
united
states
of
america
and
so,
when
we
come
to
the
question
of
whether
they
had
the
power
to
dismiss,
this
has
great
bearing
upon
that.
section
4
for
example,
under
which
this
case
was
conducted,
specifically
provides
in
plain
language
that
the
commission
shall
fix
just
and
reasonable
rates,
section
5
directs
that
they
shall
fix
rates
--
just
and
reasonable
rates
and
it
simply
was
not
done
here.
coming
to
the
examiner's
decision,
it
was
a
first
effort,
it
was
a
pioneer
effort,
it
took
82
days
and
there
were
four
major
cost-of-service
studies
presented.
one
by
phillips
itself
which
insisted
that
this
case
be
tried
upon
the
cost
method
and
that
is
very
important
as
i
shall
hereinafter
demonstrate.
the
examiner
said,
in
the
record
before
this
court,
it
may
be
noted
at
the
outset
that
phillips
itself
has
taken
the
position
throughout
this
proceeding
that
its
just
and
reasonable
rates
should
be
determined
under
the
cost-of-service
method
rather
than
under
a
field
price
method.
the
swerdling
decision
grasped
the
producer
problem,
it
applied
a
rate
base
to
it.
it
settled
the
very
difficult
problem
of
allocation
as
between
oil
and
gas.
it
fixed
the
rate
of
return
and
in
that
rate
of
return,
it
used
it
for
the
vehicle
that
it
is
to
give
compensation
for
the
admitted
risk
which
is
in
this
business
which
makes
it
somewhat
different
from
other
utilities,
but
there
was
a
compensation
given
for
the
risk
and
it
went
on
in
short
to
apply
the
rate
based
method
to
phillips
as
a
producer.
the
examiner
pointed
out
that
this
being
the
first
case,
there
were
problems
which
were
encountered
for
the
first
time,
but
the
fact
that
he
did
it
demonstrates
that
it
can
be
done
and
that
it
was
done
on
a
cost-of-service
method.
the
examiner
went
on
to
point
out
that
this
task
of
regulating
producers
could
be
made
simple
by
self-help
upon
the
part
of
the
commission
and
he
referred
to
the
fact
that
when
they
first
commenced
to
regulate
pipelines,
they
did
not
have
a
system
of
uniform
accounts
nor
did
they
then,
nor
do
they
now
have
such
for
producers
and
he
suggested
that
that
might
be
adopted.
and
california
incidentally
has
also
asked
the
commission
to
do
that
very
thing
and
so
he
must
realize
that
some
of
the
difficulties
which
are
stated
are
not
being
cured
simply
because
there
is
no
uniformity
of
accounting
being
prescribed
which
the
commission
has
the
full
power
under
the
natural
gas
act
to
do.
the
examiner's
decision
after
completion
and
after
demonstrating
that
that
which
could
not
be
done
was
done
then
went
to
the
federal
power
commission
itself.
and
at
that
time,
the
commission
consisted
of
commissioners
kuykendall,
commissioner
stuppe
and
commissioner
klein.
there
were
only
three
votes
on
opinion
number
338
which
took
over
and
modified
the
opinion
of
examiner
swerdling.
the
important
thing
to
note
in
the
opinion
number
338
by
those
three
commissioners,
not
the
present
commission,
is
that
they
described
the
swerdling
cost-of-service
method
as
being
unworkable,
impractical,
ineffective
and
that
it
would
lead
to
absurd
results.
it
is
somewhat
as
though
i
were
to
say,
this
building
could
not
be
built,
literally.
mr.
swerdling
did
it
and
the
commission
after
saying
it
was
unworkable,
applied
it
to
phillips
in
this
very
case.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
there
is
not
your
honor
by
the
words
which
are
employed
in
the
briefs,
but
i
shall
demonstrate
when
i
come
to
it.
there
is
a
startling
inconsistency
between
the
action
of
the
new
commission
and
the
action
of
the
old
commission
and
the
words
of
the
new
commission
in
its
position
before
this
court
and
i
shall
come
to
that
momentarily.
now,
i
would
point
out
to
this
court
that
the
previous
commission
discarded
for
the
producing
industry
the
cost
basis
for
regulation.
and
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
it
could
not
have
been
done
based
upon
any
evidence
in
the
phillips
case
before
examiner
swerdling
because
he
found,
quite
to
the
contrary
and
as
i
pointed
out,
the
phillips
petroleum
company
itself
said
that
it
could
be
done
and
wanted
it
done
that
way.
so,
where
then
comes
this
experience
which
is
not
in
this
record
from
which
they
could
conclude
that
it
was
not
workable.
i
suggest
that
it
comes
from
some
history
which
we
find
in
the
statement
of
chairman
kuykendall
to
the
house
committee
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
wherein
after
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1954
saying
that
producers
were
subject
to
regulation,
the
commissioner
in
a
letter
to
that
committee
said,
“the
question
remains
however,
whether
the
supreme
court's
decision
in
the
phillips
case
reflects
the
true
public
interest
or
whether
legislation
amendatory
to
the
natural
gas
act
is
needed
for
that
purpose.”
and
he
concluded
in
this
letter
which
he
read
to
the
committee
by
saying,
“consequently,
we
believe
that
the
federal
government
should
not
undertake
the
control
or
the
regulation
of
rates
of
those
engaged
in
the
production,
gathering,
processing
and
so
on
and
so
forth
of
the
selling
of
natural
gas.”
that
was
one
piece
of
the
experience
i
think
which
went
into
that
conclusion
that
it
wasn't
workable.
it
was
more
of
an
attitude
than
experience
because
they
had
had
no
experience.
then
when
the
attempt
to
exempt
failed,
the
commission
in
1938,
in
its
38th
annual
report
suggested
to
the
congress
that
there
should
not
be
the
cost
basis,
but
rather
a
standard
for
pricing
or
evaluating
natural
gas
as
a
commodity,
not
regulation
but
simply
market
price.
so,
i
would
suggest
that
an
attitude,
if
not
a
biased,
accounts
for
this
language,
that
they
were
determined
not
to
regulate
in
the
first
instance
and
after
they
were
told
to
regulate,
they
tell
the
congress
it's
still
not
in
the
public
interest
and
after
the
exemption
attempt
didn't
work,
then
they
said,
“well,
let's
regulate
upon
a
commodity
basis.”
i
suggest
that's
the
basis
for
the
experience.
now,
i
also
point
out
that
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
they
do,
your
honor
but
the
majority
of
course
ruled
otherwise.
now,
let
me
point
out
some
other
experience
which
is
the
basis
for
this
most
unorthodox
finding
if
we're
supposed
to
find
upon
records.
in
its
brief
at
page
7,
which
is
filed
before
this
court,
this
commission
says,
“it
was
not
until
the
receipt
of
the
examiner's
report
that
the
commission
had
the
opportunity
to
examine
this
major
case.”
in
the
commission's
view,
the
most
important
question
was
whether
cost-of-service
should
be
applied.
the
commission
concluded
in
the
light
of
its
experience
in
this
and
other
cases
and
bear
in
mind
the
experience
in
this
case
proved
that
it
could
done,
but
the
commission
concluded
in
the
light
of
the
experience
in
this
and
other
cases
during
the
recent
five
years
that
the
cost
method
would
not
work
and
in
the
footnote
it
listed
the
experience
in
the
other
cases
and
listen
to
what
the
government
recites.
a
number
of
minor
cases
involving
slender
records
relatively
few
sales
and
little
or
no
attempt
to
face
the
basic
problems
raised
here
are
cited
in
footnotes
8
and
9
of
the
commission's
opinion.
that
those
minor
cases
involving
slender
records,
few
sales
and
no
experience
and
no
attempt
to
face
up
to
the
problem
constitute
the
experience
of
the
commission
leading
to
the
language
here
that
it
is
not
workable.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
it
did.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
it
is
the
commission's
function
to
make
the
determination,
but
the
commission
is
bound
to
make
determinations
based
upon
records
before
it
or
in
the
alternative
upon
some
other
expertise
or
experience
and
i
hope
that
i
have
demonstrated
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
experience.
there
was
an
attitude
contrary
to
regulation
of
producers
as
this
court
knows
and
as
the
congress
was
told
and
i
don't
submit
that
that
is
tantamount
to
evidence
upon
which
a
judgment
so
important
as
this
could
or
should've
been
made.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
your
honor
and
the
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes,
it
is
their
job
and
i
will
come
shortly
in
this
case
to
the
point
from
experience
where
they
have
gone
back
to
cost-of-service
which
casts
i
think,
even
greater
doubt
upon
this
language
and
certainly,
it
seems
to
me,
would
reinforce
my
position
that
they
do
not
accept
that
premise
of
cost-of-services
is
unworkable.
they
do
not
accept
it
by
what
they
do.
now,
following
opinion
338,
there
were
promulgated
these
price
lists
and
in
passing,
let
me
point
out
that
prices
are
not
rates.
nowhere
in
the
natural
gas
act
do
you
find
that
the
duty
or
even
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
promulgate
prices,
that's
usually
the
function
of
the
marketplace.
the
commission
failed
to
find
a
lawful
rate
in
this
case.
it
terminated,
even
though
it
was
directed
by
the
court
of
appeals
pursuant
to
what
this
court
said
to
fix
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
of
phillips.
we
don't
know
what
those
just
and
reasonable
rates
are
as
i'm
standing
here
and
as
i
say,
the
prices
were
then
promulgated
without
notice,
without
hearing.
now,
if
they
mean
nothing,
of
course,
there
is
no
harm.
but
if
they
mean
something,
there's
great
harm
and
whether
legally
they
mean
something
or
nothing,
imagine
the
great
example
to
the
industry
that
these
prices
coming
from
this
great
agency
set
and
are
having
and
that
cannot
be
minimized.
i
propose
not
to
talk
about
cost
because
as
i
conclude,
i
will
place
to
the
court
that
in
my
judgment,
the
choice
here
is
between
regulation
which
means
cost
and
no
regulation
which
means
no
cost
as
they
propose
it.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no,
your
honor,
it
isn't
--
that
is
not
completely
my
position
and
i
shall
develop
it
in
this
discussion
which
i
am
about
to
begin,
but
let
me
begin
this
way,
why
cost?
why
should
we
use
cost?
well,
it's
quite
simple
in
the
beginning.
congress
in
enacting
the
natural
gas
act
intended
cost.
this
hope
--
this
court
in
the
hope
case
pointed
out
that
the
act
provided
for
regulation
upon
recognized
and
more
or
less
standardized
lines
and
regulation
means
costs
and
in
the
hope
case,
you
proved
the
cost
method
involving
natural
gas
company
as
is
phillips.
pipelines,
how
are
they
regulated?
costs,
no
other
way,
traditional
rate
based
method.
producers,
how
are
they
regulated,
costs.
the
city
of
detroit
case
involved
the
production
activities
of
a
pipeline
operation
and
in
that
case,
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
that
it
was
the
duty
of
the
federal
power
commission
in
fixing
the
return
upon
production
property
to
do
it
upon
a
cost
basis.
and
what
did
the
federal
power
commission
do
with
the
language
from
the
city
of
detroit
case,
in
the
union
oil
case
cited
in
all
the
briefs,
they
concurred,
they
accepted
it
and
they
said,
“this
is
the
law”
and
they
proceeded
to
regulate
producers
upon
a
cost
basis
in
name
only,
not
in
fact
but
at
least
they
utilized
the
right
words
consistent
with
the
directions
of
all
of
the
courts
of
appeal
in
the
united
states
without
exception
as
to
cost.
what
does
the
staff
of
the
power
commission
do?
since
1938,
it,
interpreting
that
act
has
always
used
cost.
before
the
phillips
case
it
used
it.
the
examiner
of
the
commission,
mr.
swerdling
used
it
in
the
phillips
case.
the
commission
itself
in
the
phillips
case
even
though
it
said
it
wasn't
workable,
did
utilize
it.
now,
this
court
itself,
in
opinions
written
by
mr.
justice
douglas
has
said
upon
three
occasions
and
those
opinions
have
not
been
modified
in
anywise,
whatsoever
that
in
fixing
a
return
upon
production
properties,
the
rate
base
method
as
it
were
used
by
the
commission
is
quite
lawful
and
acceptable
and
i'm
referring
to
the
hope
case
where
hope
had
production
properties.
i'm
referring
to
the
colorado
interstate
gas
case
where
they
had
production
properties
and
i'm
referring
to
the
panhandle
case
where
they
had
production
properties.
and
in
each
and
every
one
of
those
cases,
the
commission
used
the
cost
method
to
fix
the
return
upon
the
natural
gas
producing
properties
and
this
court
said,
“that
is
the
way
to
do
it.”
mr.
william
m.
bennett
no.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
did
not
say
it
was
the
exclusive
way,
i
concede
that.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
since
the
phillips
case,
there
is
the
case
known
as
the
glassell
case
cited
in
the
briefs
and
the
commission
there
used
the
cost-of-service
method.
let
me
point
out
that
in
the
hunt
case,
the
hunt
oil
case
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
on
october
17th,
1962,
the
present
commission
remanded
the
hunt
proceedings
and
directed
in
this
language
that
cost-of-service
evidence
be
received.
cost-of-service
which
was
the
method
used
in
this
proceeding
and
others
pending
before
the
commission
prior
to
the
commencement
of
the
area
rate
proceedings
and
as
we
have
previously
indicated,
we
intend
to
continue
to
process
and
decide
such
proceedings
as
promptly
as
the
record
in
each
case
permits.
then
on
november
30th,
1962,
in
the
hunt
case,
this
present
commission
said
and
i'm
quoting,
“in
summary,
the
basic
defect
in
all
of
hunt's
cost-of-service
presentations
is
a
utilization
of
allocation
methods
rejected
in
phillips,
this
phillips
case
and
a
failure
to
provide
information
with
which
a
proper
cost-of-service
for
hunt
could
be
determined.”
and
so,
i
would
now
say
to
the
court
in
answer
to
the
question
that
this
present
commission,
despite
what
it
says
in
its
briefs
in
defending
the
language
from
the
past
that
cost-of-service
is
unworkable
as
to
producers
is
utilizing
it
in
the
two
cases
i've
cited
to
this
court
and
i've
said
that
it
intends
to
utilize
it
in
other
producer
cases,
not
that
there
are
many
because
they're
in
a
state
of
limbo,
the
pending
area
rate
determinations,
but
when
they
do
have
producer
cases
which
somehow
get
to
them
over
and
above
area
rate
proceedings,
they're
going
to
use
cost-of-service
and
that
must
mean
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
it's
workable.
now,
a
few
observations
coming
from
common
sense
would
seem
to
be
an
order
here
about
cost.
how
does
american
industry
or
the
financial
community
conduct
its
affairs
except
upon
a
cost
basis?
phillips
is
no
different,
it
happens
to
be
subject
to
regulation.
its
books
are
kept
upon
a
cost
basis,
its
return
is
measured
upon
a
cost
basis,
and
costs
in
the
regulatory
field
are
simply
the
measurement
whereby
we
properly
can
limit
return.
in
unregulated
sectors
of
the
economy
it's
a
measurement
but
there's
no
limit
upon
the
return
at
least
in
theory,
but
it
is
inevitable.
it
is
impossible
to
regulate
an
industry
without
cost
as
the
tool
to
do
it.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
my
answer
runs
this
way,
if
your
honor
please.
the
commission
may
state
and
the
supreme
court
may
agree
that
there
is
no
single
way
to
regulate
as
the
hope
case
did.
it's
the
end
result
that
counts,
but
that
presumes
that
there
is
some
other
acceptable,
practical
and
lawful
method
at
hand.
now,
why
do
i
say
at
hand
because
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
speak
in
futuro.
it
demands
consumer
protection
now
and
this
court
in
your
phillips
decision
demanded
consumer
rate
protection
through
the
regulation
of
producers
now,
not
in
1970
or
not
in
1980,
but
now.
and
i
don't
quarrel
with
the
right
to
experiment,
none
of
us
quarrel
with
that
right,
but
we
quarrel
with
the
laying
down,
with
the
laying
down,
with
the
placing
upon
the
shelf
of
the
mandate
of
this
court
of
the
only
tool,
of
the
only
weapon
which
is
available
to
regulate
this
industry.
that
is
the
vice
of
this
case
and
when
i
come
to
the
relief,
i
asked,
i
will
spell
out
what
i
think
they
should
do
in
the
meantime
and
i
would
suggest
now
that
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
they
have
the
right
to
depart
from
cost,
if
the
reasons
they
gave,
one
of
them
was,
it
was
not
workable.
and
if
the
previous
commission
found
it
--
in
all
of
its
experience,
say
phillips
to
be
workable
and
even
used
it
in
phillips.
if
the
present
commission
is
using
it
in
the
hunt
case
and
in
the
glassell
case,
if
the
examiners
of
the
commission
are
using
it
in
their
section
4
and
5
investigations
of
producers
as
they
are,
then
i
would
say
that
the
premise
from
which
we
leaped
off
into
the
area
experiment
is
not
a
sound
premise.
if
it's
more
than
the
premise,
if
they
considered
it
a
compelling
reason
to
experiment,
haven't
i
demonstrated
that
that
is
not
a
reason?
doesn't
the
commission
itself
through
the
utilization
of
cost-of-service
tell
this
court
in
reality,
regardless
of
its
briefs
that
it
is
workable?
now,
if
something
is
unworkable,
we
abandon
it,
fine,
but
if
something
is
workable,
does
it
still
follow
that
we
abandon
it
when
area
rates
is
nothing
more
to
date
but
a
grand
experiment.
judge
prettyman
said,
we
make
it,
the
answer
to
it
in
four
to
14
years.
and
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
think
i
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
yes
your
honor,
i'm
pushing
it
hard
but
obviously
i'm
taking
advantage
of
what
he
said
and
i
hope
the
court
will
[laughter]
receive
it
in
that
light
but
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
well,
but
--
mr.
william
m.
bennett
i
don't
know
how
long
it
will
take.
i
think
it
will
not
take
14
years,
but
let
me
read
what
the
government
says
as
to
how
long
it
will
take.
this
is
on
page
29
of
the
government's
brief.
“the
experience
of
the
first
six
years
of
producer
regulation
led
the
commission
at
that
point
to
estimate
that
nearly
13
years
would
be
required
in
order
to
dispose
of
the
cases
pending.”
pardon
me,
i'm
in
error
on
that
that
--
i
didn't
mean
that
the
way
it
came
out,
that
13
years
referred
to
the
number
of
cases
pending,
i
was
mistaken,
i
misspoke
myself.
and
i
thought
that
was
a
source
of
judge
prettyman's
14
years
but
it
is
not,
but
in
any
event,
i
think
we
all
agree
it
is
going
to
take
a
great
deal
of
time.
now,
what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
cost-of-service
was
prematurely
abandoned.
it
was
abandoned
for
the
wrong
reason.
and
remember
now,
we're
abandoning
a
method
which
the
staff
demonstrates
and
which
the
commission
itself
both
past
and
present
by
its
use,
shows
it's
workable
and
we
don't
have
to
quarrel
about
whether
it's
lawful
or
has
to
pass
test
of
constitutionality,
it
is.
let
me
examine
area
rates
then
by
way
of
comparison
and
contrast.
as
i
say,
it
started
in
what
i
consider
to
be
an
erroneous
premise.
it
started
by
rejecting
a
known
and
an
effective
and
a
practical
method.
it
starts
with
a
description
that
it
may
take
from
four
to
14
years.
it
is
supposed
to
result
in
stability,
it
hasn't
yet.
and
i
would
point
out
that
under
the
natural
gas
act,
if
after
we
get
through
these
massive
hearings
with
all
of
these
producers,
section
4
of
the
act
as
the
hunt
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
points
out
that
a
single
producer
may
arise
and
file
for
an
increase
despite
this
grand
experiment
and
even
more
than
a
single
producer,
it
may
be
all
of
them
and
where
then
is
this
stability
coming
out
of
this
master
production?
i
would
point
out
that
many
lawyers
have
grave
doubts
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
area
method
because
the
natural
gas
act
seems
to
say
that
rate
should
be
fixed
upon
an
individual
basis.
i
would
point
out
that
the
commission
is
being
less
than
correct
in
saying
that
they
measure
their
workload
by
all
the
dockets,
you
measure
the
workload
by
the
number
of
producers
and
there
are
only
295
producers
who
account
for
91%
of
the
production
of
this
country.
and
if
they
were
regulated,
the
rest
would
fall
in
line
because
it
is
not
economic
sense
that
pipelines
are
going
to
rush
to
small
uneconomic
producers
to
pay
them
high
prices
for
gas
when
they
can
get
it
from
the
larger
producers
at
a
lower
rate.
i
would
point
out
that
the
leveling
off
which
is
talked
about
in
the
government's
brief
comes
not
from
area
prices,
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
there
happens
to
be
on
overabundance
of
natural
gas
in
this
country
at
this
time.
now,
let
me
conclude
by
saying
that
the
protection
we're
getting
from
the
price
list
is
nothing
but
a
myth,
no
protection
at
all.
commissioner
morgan
of
the
present
commission
has
described
these
as
simply
fair
field
prices
and
that's
what
they
are.
and
in
the
very
phillips
case
itself,
in
which
the
commission
said,
“in
the
meantime,
we're
getting
the
protection
of
the
price
list.”
there
are
five
dockets
in
that
phillips
case,
which
were
permitted
to
go
into
effect,
the
rates,
schedules
and
the
prices
of
which
are
above
the
agency's
own
price
ceilings.
it's
obviously
in
error
but
that's
what
happened.
now,
judge
prettyman
says
if
the
area
experiment
turns
out
to
be
a
failure,
we
have
our
remedy
then.
we
don't
have
a
remedy
then,
we
need
it
now.
and
so,
i
say
in
conclusion
that
in
the
meantime,
they
should
take
up
the
processing
of
the
producers
on
a
cost-of-service
basis,
select
the
largest
one
first,
the
largest
ones
first,
get
the
job
done,
set
some
examples,
set
some
principles
and
the
problem
will
go
away,
i
predict.
all
regulation
has
this
difficulty
in
the
beginning,
only
you've
got
to
make
a
beginning.
i
am
claiming,
from
the
statement
of
chairman
kuykendall,
that
here
was
a
man
who
was
opposed
sincerely
but
philosophically
from
personal
conviction
to
regulation
of
producers.
he
did
not
believe
it
could
or
should
have
been
done
and
he
wrote
opinion
338,
and
i
say,
if
that
represents
bias
or
less
than
an
open
mind,
then
so
be
it.
i
don't
question
his
right
to
have
that
point
of
view,
but
i
happen
to
disagree
with
it
strongly
and
i
happen
to
think
that
this
court
and
the
congress
have
settled
the
question
a
long
time
ago.
mr.
william
m.
bennett
the
present
commission
has
an
intolerable
heritage,
great
difficulties.
the
present
commission
has
come
out
with
a
good
decision
for
my
state
involving
our
pipeline
company,
but
the
present
commission
in
adopting
the
unworkable
premise
as
to
cost-of-service
made
an
error
in
my
opinion
and
i
think
that
what
they've
done
subsequently
indicates
that
they
themselves
know
it.
they
were
not
bound
to
wet
themselves
to
this
concept
of
regulation
and
all
of
the
difficulties,
your
honor,
that
they
pose
as
to
why
cost-of-service
method
won't
work
are
just
as
applicable
to
the
area
experiment
because
unless
this
court
says
that
costs
are
not
necessary,
are
they
permitted
to
dispense
with
costs
in
the
area
rate
experiment?
for
example,
they
say
in
the
brief
before
you
that
cost-of-service
method
is
not
appropriate
or
it's
difficult
because
of
grave
problems
of
allocation.
well,
in
area
rates,
are
we
not
going
to
allocate
between
oil
and
gas?
in
area
rates,
are
we
going
to
abandon
cost-of-service?
i
don't
know
nor
does
anybody
unless
you
can
tell
them
and
i
would
like
to
talk
about
this
now
because
this
is
the
real
tragedy
of
this
case.
unless,
they
can
have
some
idea
that
where
they're
going
is
going
to
be
practical
and
effective
and
if
that
going
takes
time,
and
if
it's
fraught
with
failure
at
the
end
and
ends
that
way,
what
happens
to
consumers
in
the
meantime
when
they
are
not
going
through
this
list
of
the
dominant
producers
in
the
country
and
regulating
them
one
by
one.
do
you
know
for
example
that
in
the
area
rate
experiment,
there
are
only
two
areas
thus
far
selected,
hearings
are
going
forward
in
one?
now,
both
of
these
areas
combined
only
cover
35%
of
the
system
of
phillips,
what
about
the
balance
of
it?
to
me
frankly,
this
is
nothing
more
than
turning
your
back
upon
that
which
has
been
pioneered
and
worked
out
by
people
before
us
and
by
this
court
and
deciding
from
commendable
motives,
no
doubt,
to
do
it
another
way,
another
unknown
way.
and
so,
it's
difficult,
i
know
to
say
an
agency
abuses
its
discretion,
but
remember
your
mandate
which
says
regulate,
remember
the
natural
gas
act.
and
the
gravity
of
the
harm
that
will
follow
if
this
thing
ends
up
in
failure
will
then
certainly
be
able
to
be
called
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
what
i'm
asking
is,
do
we
have
to
wait
to
find
out
that
long
that
it's
a
mistake
to
come
here
and
seek
our
remedy
and
if
we
do,
and
if
we're
right
that
it's
all
for
naught,
we
will
never,
ever
make
up,
not
my
money,
not
the
money
of
this
court
but
the
money
the
consumers
and
congress
has
spoken
for
their
interest
as
has
this
court.
thank
you,
your
honors.
