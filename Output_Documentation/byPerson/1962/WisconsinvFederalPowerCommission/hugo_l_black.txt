what
year
was
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
excuse
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you
picked
the
rates
for
an
area
of
15
per
units,
whatever
your
unit
is,
15
cents
per
unit?
one
company
comes
in
and
says,
that's
alright
for
all
of
them
--
most
of
them,
i
can't
operate
without
losing
my
business.
this
is
confiscation
to
me.
what
happens
then?
what
would
the
court
have
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
chose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
chose
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
he
chose
it,
you
picked
an
average
rate,
you
--
as
i
have
understood
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
different
companies
have
different
costs
and
make
different
amounts
of
profits.
suppose
one
of
them
chose
that
the
rate
you
fixed
on
the
average
confiscates
his
property,
let's
assume
that
he's
proven
it,
what
happens
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
he
have
to
follow
those
rates?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
sort
of
thinking
about
your
problem
that
you
are
--
of
the
difficulties
of
fixing
individual
rates
and
i
understood
you
to
say,
maybe
i'm
wrong
that
the
--
if
you
fix
them
altogether,
that
wouldn't
necessarily
raise
them
to
the
highest
cost
then,
how
could
you
keep
from
doing
it,
raising
it
to
the
highest
cost
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
that.
your
answer
to
me
then,
as
i
understand
it
is,
that
even
though
the
rates
you
fixed
would
be
confiscatory
to
the
phillips
for
instance
because
of
its
higher
cost
than
others,
it
will
have
to
sell
at
that
price
that
you
think.
as
i
understand
that's
your
answer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
get
out
of
the
business?
justice
hugo
l.
black
interstate
market.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
started
to
quit
that
for
lunch,
but
l
asked
you
that
because
i
thought
about
the
fact
that
the
basic
rates
are
fixed
originally
according
by
the
company
and
rather
difficult
to
unfix
those
rates
and
they
vary
according
to
what
they
think,
they
ought
to
get
or
what
they
can
give.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
when
the
commission
was
acting
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
however,
it
would
be
a
very
natural
inclination
for
them
to
--
if
they're
going
to
take
a
whole
group
together
by
the
sea
that
they
didn't
hurt
any
--
anyone
particular
a
company,
only
six
or
seven
so
that
you
would
tend
to
have
as
a
fixed
price,
not
a
maximum
price,
as
a
just
and
reasonable
price,
the
price
that
might
give
some
people
what
they
considered
a
reasonable
profit
and
give
the
others
five
times
as
much.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
would
also
assume
maybe
--
maybe
i
could
be
wrong,
is
when
they
start
to
kind
of
fix
some
kind
of
an
average
price,
these
contract
prices
that
had
been
fixed
when
there
was
no
regulation
of
any
kind
and
which
are
pretty
well
fixed
subject
to
certain
procedures
whereby
they
might
be
held
unjust
and
unreasonable,
maybe
the
average
would
be
figured
according
to
the
average
of
these
contract
prices.
justice
hugo
l.
black
from
what
basis
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
those
refunds
ordered
for
what
year?
you
say
$30
million?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
basis
--
what
year;
that
i
don't
quite
understand?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
you
can't
--
if
you
can't
decide
phillips
on
the
basis,
what
good
is
the
bond
or
anything
else
with
reference
to
the
refund?
if
you
can't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
decide
it
now
as
of
1954
or
whenever
it
was.
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
of
1954,
the
reasonable
value
as
of
1954?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mr.
solomon,
i
want
to
ask,
and
yet
i'm
unable
to
understand
precisely
the
reasoning
by
which
you
reconcile
what
was
done
in
hunt
and
the
later
cases
and
the
dismissal
of
the
five
proceedings
against
phillips,
unless
it's
simply
be
by
reason
of
change
in
the
commission.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
means
that
that
case
is
being
decided
on
the
cost-of-service.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
in
this
case,
however,
it
was
thought
impossible
to
do
it
and
suit
was
dismissed.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
of
the
record
did
you
refer
to
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
you
said
that's
part
of
the
record.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
--
i
just
thought
you
had
referred
to
a
particular
page.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
do
you
say
admittedly
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
california,
the
gentleman
has
argued
here
awhile
ago,
they
admit
that
your
rates
were
valid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
one
thing
i
didn't
understand
and
i
understood
you
to
say
that
no
increase
has
occurred
by
reason
of
the
dismissal
of
the
4
(e)
proceedings.
does
that
mean
that
the
attack
could
still
be
made
with
reference
to
those
rates
at
that
time?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
it's
nothing
they
could
do
so
far
as
this
refund
--
this
ends
the
refund
chances
if
they're
--
if
they
have
a
word.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
for
future?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
understand
then
from
you
is
that
--
it
hasn't
been
perfectly
clear
but
does
it
make
any
difference
now
--
what
could
be
shown
that
the
commission
by
dismissing
this
on
the
ground
that
it
couldn't
decide
it
at
this
time
on
the
basis
where
the
method
which
it
asked
has
permanently
cut
off
the
chance
to
get
a
refund
if
these
rates
were
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
they
did
--
if
whatever
the
reason,
it
has
cut
off
by
determination
any
chance
to
get
a
refund
later.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you're
standing
on
the
basis
that
they
actually
have
decided
the
case
on
its
merits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
so
understand
from
the
government.
i'm
--
i'm
--
it's
evident
i
misunderstood
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
case
seems
to
leave
considerable
questions
to
whether
it's
part
to
conduct
proceedings
and
to
regulate
a
big
industry
like
this
in
the
time
enough
so
that
you
can
never
get
a
final
judgment
before
the
figures
are
obsolete.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
in
passing
on
the
price,
does
the
commission
have
a
problem?
it
recently
appeared
with
reference
to
the
condemnation
of
the
land
when
the
government
buys
some
property
that
the
prices
vary
according
to
the
hopes
of
the
prices
that
the
commission
will
make?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
very,
very
varying
--
it's
been
very,
very
varying
--
here
from
a
very
short
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
we've
had
many
cases
which
indicates
a
skyrocket
up
pretty
high
in
a
very,
very
short
period
of
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
difference
between
you
and
the
counsel
for
phillips
as
to
the
reason
why
the
commission
dismissed
both
4
(e)
and
5
(a)
terminated
the
proceedings?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
that
they
did
it
on
the
merits
of
the
plans
of
increase?
