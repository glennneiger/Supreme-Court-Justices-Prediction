justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
cox,
are
you
directing
this
argument
to
the
position
that
the
interstate
commerce
clause
would
be
violated
these
things?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
government's
power
provides
the
goods
on
its
own
terms?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
think
that
the
government
protects
itself
against
such
a
situation
as
that,
by
doing
its
own
work,
paying
the
wages
it
saw
fit.
as
i
imagine,
that
would
draw
a
completely
distinct
line.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
do
you
distinguish
it
then
on
that
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
that
there,
there
was
actual
frustration
for
the
federal
policy,
do
you
not?
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
could
wait
if
you
would.
but
i
just
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
basing
a
constitutional
distinction
on
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
in
one
case,
by
a
household
good
be
shipped
by
the
government,
the
constitution
would
not
give
them
immunity,
but
if
military
goods
were
shipped,
it
would.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
one
should
not
agree
with
you
on
that
distinction,
what
would
you
then
say
about
the
california
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
would
you
distinguish
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
you
do
not
reach
a
constitutional
point
there,
that
you
depend
on
the
interpretation
of
the
congressional
enactment,
is
that
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
rely
on
any
congressional
enactment
since
the
california
case
was
decided?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
you
draw
the
distinction
and
the
attitude
of
congress
in
connection
--
as
shown
by
those
two
acts?
