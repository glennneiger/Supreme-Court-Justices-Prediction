chief
justice
earl
warren
am
i
right
of
my
recollection,
mr.
solicitor
general,
that
by
statute
the
government
does
assume
itself
the
obligation
of
transporting
the
personal
effects
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
of
officers
from
one
place
to
another
when
they're
transferring?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
whatever
they
pay
would
be
--
would
affect
the
government
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
rodgers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
the
character
of
the
employment
involved
here
make
any
difference
to
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
it
was
armed
--
armed
services,
family
of
armed
services,
would
that,
in
your
opinion,
be
different
from
this
which
was
a
housing
project?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now,
mr.
rodgers.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
