mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case,
which
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
sitting
in
the
northern
district
of
georgia,
raises
two
questions,
the
second
and
third
questions
on
the
merits,
which
were
raised
in
the
previous
case.
it
comes
before
this
court
on
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
dismissing
the
government's
complaint
for
an
injunction.
the
government
sought
an
injunction
against
the
enforcement
of
the
georgia
rate
schedules
on
intrastate
shipments
of
goods
being
shipped
on
the
federal
government's
bill
of
lading.
the
facts
are
in
no
way
in
dispute.
they
may
be
summarized
as
follows.
but
there
are
in
georgia
25
federal
military
establishments
and
a
number
of
civilian
federal
establishments.
it's
the
obligation
of
the
government,
in
a
considerable
number
of
cases
when
an
employee
is
transferred
from
post
to
post
for
the
convenience
of
the
government,
to
arrange
for
the
transportation
of
his
goods
or
to
reimburse
him
for
the
cost
of
transportation
as
the
government
may
choose.
the
usual
practice,
and
indeed
the
historic
practice,
has
been
for
the
federal
transportation
officers
to
arrange
the
shipments
of
these
household
goods.
they
negotiate
a
rate
or
award
contracts
to
the
lowest
bidder.
the
property
of
all
the
employees
will
then
be
shipped
on
a
single
government
bill
of
lading.
and,
by
government
bill
of
lading,
i
mean
not
only
one
to
which
the
government
is
a
party,
but
a
government
form
of
bill
of
lading
which
has
in
it,
as
i
shall
point
out
in
more
detail
later,
a
number
of
clauses
which
are
not
contained
in
the
usual
uniform
bill
of
lading
or
other
bills
of
lading
of
that
type.
in
19
--
then,
the
property
is
paid
for
of
course
or
the
shipment
is
paid
for
by
the
government
check
in
due
course
of
which
incidentally
usually
involves
an
extension
of
credit
that
would
be
prohibited
in
the
case
of
a
private
shipper.
in
1960,
there
were
about
1,100
carrier
shipments
within
georgia
of
the
household
goods
of
either
military
or
civilian
personnel
on
these
government
bills
of
lading.
the
procurement
activities
are
governed
either
by
the
armed
forces
procurement
act
in
the
case
of
property
for
civilian
employees
of
the
department
of
defense
or
the
property
of
military
personnel.
they
are
governed
by
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act,
which
is
substantially
the
same,
in
the
case
of
shipments
of
the
household
goods
of
civilian
personnel.
i
will
discuss
the
act
and
the
regulations
a
little
later.
it's
enough
to
say
that
in
our
view,
they
require
procurement
officers
to
obtain
the
lowest
rates
possible
without
regard
to
state
law.
now,
georgia
has
a
statute
of
regulating
intrastate
truck
shipments.
it
appears
on
page
--
appears
on
page
69
in
the
back
of
our
brief,
at
the
beginning
of
the
appendix.
under
section
613
of
their
motor
vehicle
code,
the
commission
is
given
power
to
proscribe
just
and
reasonable
rates,
fares,
and
charges
for
transportation
by
motor
common
carriers.
in
another
section,
the
commission
is
given
power
to
issue
rules
and
regulations
necessary
to
implement
the
act
and,
pursuant
to
that
power,
the
commission
--
the
georgia
commission
has
issued
a
regulation
which
appears
over
on
page
85,
that
is
very
pertinent
here.
it
requires
all
shipments
to
be
made
under
a
uniformed
household
goods
bill
of
lading.
in
other
words,
if
this
applies,
the
government
cannot
adhere
to
the
usual
government
form
of
bill
of
lading.
and
down
the
last
sentence
in
rule
15,
property
of
two
or
more
families
or
establishments
will
not
be
accepted
for
transportation
as
a
single
shipment.
in
other
words,
the
making
of
a
mass
shipment
of
the
household
goods
of
500
or
600
or
more
people
is
prohibited
at
least
to
the
extent
that
each
must
be
made
as
a
separate
shipment
under
a
separate
bill
of
lading.
in
july
1960,
there
was
to
be
such
a
mass
movement,
although
perhaps
not
as
large
as
500
or
600
employees,
of
employees
of
the
department
of
public
health
from
savannah
to
atlanta.
now,
the
procurement
officers
of
the
federal
government
invited
bids.
they
received
15
bids
--
13
bids.
eight
of
them
simply
quoted
the
georgia
rates
on
household
goods.
five
bids
were
below
the
georgia
rates
and
the
government
accepted
the
lowest
of
those
bids
from
consolidated
van
&
storage
company.
thereupon,
the
georgia
public
utilities
commission
threatened
to
revoke
the
license
of
consolidated
van
for
--
or
the
permit
of
consolidated
van
for
violating
the
georgia
utilities
regulation.
a
proceeding
was
started
before
the
state
commission
to
revoke
the
license
despite
the
fact
that
consolidated
immediately
broke
its
contract
--
or
immediately
sought
to
be
excused
from
its
contract
with
the
government,
the
united
states
sought
to
intervene
before
the
georgia
commission
but
was
denied
the
leave
to
intervene,
and
thereupon,
the
united
states
filed
this
bill
in
equity
seeking
to
enjoin
the
state
authorities
from
threatening
perspective
truckers
with
prosecution
under
the
state
law
if
they
should
bid
below
the
state
rates
on
government
shippers.
the
bill
sought
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
the
state
regulation
upon
two
grounds.
first,
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
procurement
statutes
and
policies.
second,
upon
the
ground
that
it
violated
the
implied
constitutional
immunity
of
the
united
states.
here
as
in
the
california
case,
a
three-judge
court
was
convened,
the
issue
in
due
course
was
limited
to
household
goods.
originally,
the
complaint
sought
to
cover
all
shipments
on
government
bill.
georgia
took
the
position
that
her
statute,
for
some
reason
that
i
don't
understand,
didn't
apply
to
shipments
of
government-owned
property
but
that
it
applied
only
to
government
shipments
of
property
on
behalf
of
its
employees.
as
so
limited,
the
case
came
before
the
three
judges
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
judgment
was
entered
dismissing
the
government's
complaint.
the
three-judge
court
said
that
it
had
difficulty
in
distinguishing
the
california
public
utilities
case
from
the
penn
dairies
case
but
that
it
thought
penn
dairies
case
was
controlled.
we
then
brought
the
cases
here
by
a
direct
appeal.
the
first
question
raised
by
the
court's
order
postponing
argument
on
the
question
of
jurisdiction
is
whether
the
court
does
have
direct
jurisdiction
on
this
appeal.
we
think
it
plain
that
it
does
for
the
reasons
that
i
stated
in
the
argument
of
the
california
case
yesterday,
that
one
of
our
two
grounds
for
seeking
an
injunction
against
enforcement
of
the
state
law
plainly
raised
a
direct
constitutional
question.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
meaning,
by
that,
so
far
as
it's
an
immunity
--
implied
immunity
case,
there
is
a
direct
constitutional
issue
and
that,
whether
the
supremacy
clause
case
would
give
--
would
require
a
three-judge
court
or
not,
needn't
be
considered
because
if
there's
--
a
three-judge
court
is
required
as
it
is
on
the
implied
immunity
ground,
then
it
hears
and
disposes
of
all
the
issues
and
the
direct
appeal
is
proper.
the
two
questions
then
which
require
some
discussion
are
other
questions
of
substance.
first,
whether
the
georgia
rate
regulation
as
applied
to
these
shipments
under
government
bills
of
lading
is
inconsistent
with
the
controlling
federal
statutes
regulation,
and
we
submit
that
it
is.
the
second
question
is
whether
georgia's
attempt
to
regulate
the
rates
for
shipments
under
government
bills
of
lading
violates
the
implied
constitutional
immunity
of
the
united
states
and
we
submit
that
it
does
because
it's
an
attempt
to
regulate
the
terms
on
which
the
government
may
contract.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
plan
to
develop
that.
let
me
indicate
briefly
why
i
say
that.
in
the
first
place,
so
far
as
the
argument
based
on
the
procurement
regulations
is
concerned,
we
think
that
cost
--
if
it's
inconsistent
with
the
federal
statutes,
a
cost
impact
is
sufficient.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
far
as
the
employee
cost
at
which
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
practical
--
there
are
further
practical
consequences
which
i
would
like
to
explain.
this
requires
a
great
deal
more
paperwork.
it
requires
a
great
deal
more
personnel.
it
would
slow
up,
in
some
respects,
the
shipments.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
think,
in
a
sense,
they
are.
nearly
everything
in
the
end
could
be
reduced
to
cost.
i
suppose,
as
i
was
going
to
use
this
illustration
later,
that
a
state
building
code
purports
to
require
iron
beams
of
a
certain
size,
fireproofing
of
certain
types
and
style,
is
that
cost
or
is
that
what
we
get?
indeed,
a
good
part
of
my
argument
is
that
the
one
runs
into
the
other
and
that,
when
you're
directly
regulating
the
government,
no
distinction
should
be
drawn.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
the
public
utilities
commission
of
california,
yes.
and,
as
to
--
also,
the
court
made
something
of
the
interference
with
the
shipments
in
that
case,
the
practical
consequences,
i
submit
that
from
the
standpoint
of
the
essential
reasoning,
that
was
unrelated
because
the
essential
reasoning
was
that
the
procurement
statute
and
regulations
in
the
view
of
the
court,
and
i
think
quite
rightly,
called
for
the
government
to
get
goods
by
methods
that
involved
competition
at
the
lowest
possible
cost.
and,
anything
which
was
inconsistent
with
that
policy
declared
in
the
statute
had
to
yield
under
the
supremacy
clause.
it
seems
to
me,
that
is
just
applicable
when
the
only
consequence
is
cost,
as
it
is
when
it
interferes
with
the
physical
movement
of
the
goods.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
related
to
cost,
personnel,
time
which
could
probably
be
offset
by
more
personnel,
trouble,
inconvenience
and
that
kind.
there's
nothing
more.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
the
government's
responsibility,
both
in
the
case
of
officers
and
civilian
personnel
transferred
to
the
convenience
of
the
government.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
immediately.
indeed,
the
shipments
--
historically,
these
shipments
have
been
handled
by
government
procurement
officers
under
government
bills
of
lading.
indeed,
it
has
been
the
historic
policy
of
congress
to
have
these
shipments
arranged
without
regard
to
utilities
regulation.
for
example,
section
22
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
exempts
government
shipments
and
government's
bills
of
lading
from
the
regulation
of
rail
carriers,
and
section
317
exempts
them
from
the
regulation
of
truck
carriers
on
interstate
shipment.
historically,
the
procurement
--
and
i
use
the
word
“historically”
advisably.
historically,
the
procurement
has
been
arranged
in
these
civilian
and
military
household
goods
have
been
shipped
without
regard
to
state
utility
regulation
statutes.
and,
in
the
very
few
cases
which
--
in
which
there
has
been
any
challenge
to
that,
because
most
of
the
states
have
accepted
it
at
least
acquiesce,
the
government
has
quite
uniformly
been
successful.
the
california
utilities
case
is
the
most
important
of
those,
being
the
only
decision
by
this
court,
and
we
think
that,
despite
the
factual
difference
that
justice
goldberg
calls
attention
to,
that
the
regulations
are
the
same,
the
statute
is
the
same,
their
policy
is
therefore
the
same
and
that
this
is
--
georgia
statute
is
more
of
an
--
more
inconsistent
with
the
policy
than
the
california
statute
was
because
the
california
statute
at
least
opened
the
door
or
crack
and
said
maybe
you
can
get
our
permission
to
negotiate,
whereas
this
permits
no
such
negotiation
at
all.
the
opinion
below,
as
i
said
earlier,
followed
the
penn
dairies
case.
here,
as
in
the
california
milk
case
that
we
argued
earlier,
we
distinguish
the
penn
dairies
case
partly
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
has
been
changed
primarily
on
the
ground
that
there
had
been
these
two
very
significant
changes
in
the
regulations
which
the
court
held
to
be
a
decisive
distinction
in
the
california
utilities
case.
we
see
no
difference
between
the
cases
in
terms
of
the
ownership
of
the
goods,
whether
they're
household
goods
or
military
goods,
because
in
each
instance
the
same
statute
and
procurement
regulations
control
and,
each
instance,
it
is
the
appropriated
funds
governed
by
those
statutes
which
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
will
ultimately
bear
the
added
expense.
the
statutes
--
the
comparison
between
the
regulations
involved
in
the
california
utilities
case
and
this
case
is
a
matter
of
detail.
it's
all
gone
through
in
our
brief
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
a
useless
expenditure
of
the
court's
time
to
go
through
those
minute
points
and
read
them
all
aloud
here.
but
we
do
submit,
i'm
sure
the
court
will
find
it
so,
that
the
statutes
--
that
the
statute
is
the
same.
the
regulations
are
substantially
the
same
in
each
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question,
you
are
now
looking
forward
to
the
part
of
the
case
where
we
rely
on
the
implied
constitutional
immunity.
i
was
just
about
to
turn
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
just
about
to
devote
the
rest
of
my
argument
to
that
very
important
point
and
with
your
honor's
permission,
i
would
like
to
fit
it
in
rather
than
take
it
up
separately.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
we
do,
in
this
case
as
in
the
california
dairy
case,
argue
that
the
statute
here,
the
georgia
statute,
is
unconstitutional
because
it
attempts
directly
to
regulate
the
terms
upon
which
the
united
states
may
contract
for
the
transportation
of
goods.
and
we
think
that
that
is
under
the
precedence
and
reasoning
of
this
court
and
under,
by
principle,
a
violation
of
the
implied
constitutional
immunity.
it
may
be
worth
recalling
very
briefly
some
of
the
established
benchmarks.
it
set
a
law,
of
course,
that
the
united
states
does
have
some
degree
of
implied
constitutional
immunity.
congress
may
expend
the
immunity
by
statute,
it
--
and
has
done
so
on
occasion.
it
may
waive
some
of
it
by
statute,
and
it
has
done
that
on
occasion.
if,
as
i
now
assume
for
the
purposes
of
argument,
there
is
no
relevant
legislation,
then
it's
for
the
court
to
define
the
scope
of
the
immunity
in
the
absence
of
and
pending
in
a
more
legislative
declaration
of
policy
on
the
subjects.
there
are
two
principles
which
are
well
set.
the
first
is
that
a
state
may
not
directly
regulate
or
pass
the
property,
instrumentalities,
or
activities
of
the
united
states.
one
of
the
clearest
illustrations
would
be
a
general
property
tax
on
a
courthouse
or
post
office
building.
in
the
field
of
regulation,
as
the
court's
decision
sufficed
several
illustrations,
a
state
may
not
restrict
the
kind
of
fertilizer
that's
distributed
on
the
programs
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
it
may
not,
as
the
court
held
in
arizona
against
california,
require
approval
of
a
dam
to
be
built
by
the
united
states
or
for
the
united
states.
and,
i
should
emphasize
in
this
connection
that
the
idea
of
direct
regulation
does
not
require
that
the
united
states
be
mentioned
by
name.
the
property
tax
is
on
all
property.
the
statute
doesn't
mention
the
united
states.
it
would
clearly
be
invalid.
in
arizona
against
california,
the
statute
regulating
--
or
requiring
a
license
to
build
a
dam
and
requiring
plans
and
specifications
be
approved
didn't
mention
the
united
states,
but
it
was
held
to
be
a
direct
interference.
the
second
rule
that
is
well
established
is
that
a
state
is
not
barred
from
imposing
nondiscriminatory
tax
or
regulation
upon
one
doing
business
with
the
united
states
merely
because
this
would
add
to
an
--
it
would
impose
an
increased
economic
burden
on
the
united
states.
in
the
tax
field,
the
familiar
illustration
i
suppose
are
the
income
taxes
that
the
states
levy
or
a
tax
upon
the
articles
which
a
contractor
may
purchase,
such
as
a
bulldozer,
shovels,
or
things
of
that
kind,
to
perform
his
construction
contract
with
the
united
states.
these
are
cases
where
the
regulation
states
or
the
--
states
what
the
contractor
may
do
in
relation
to
his
activities
rather
than
in
relation
to
the
united
states.
for
example,
examples
of
valid
regulation
are
the
minimum
--
state
minimum
wage
and
overtime
loss
which
may
be
applied
to
one
performing
work
under
a
government
contract,
safety
measure
of
the
boarding
that
goes
over
the
girders
when
a
building
is
being
constructed,
or
i
would
suppose
the
type
of
scaffolding
that
might
be
used
in
doing
the
brickwork
in
erecting
a
courthouse
or
post
office.
those
kinds
of
state
laws
are
clearly
permissible
and
not
a
violation
of
the
implied
immunity,
but
i
would
compress
them,
and
i
think
this
is
important,
with
the
direct
regulations.
a
state
can't
apply
its
building
code
to
the
buildings
of
the
united
states
because
this
bears
directly
on
the
kind
of
building
the
united
states
gets.
it
can't
regulate
the
size
of
the
iron
beam
or
the
fireproof.
it
can't,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
regulate
the
kind
of
a
dam
that
may
be
built
by
the
united
states.
all
those
are
direct
regulations
and,
therefore,
would
be
invalid.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
that
the
implied
sovereign
--
no,
that
the
implied
sovereign
immunity
would
be
violated.
no,
these
shipments
are
all
intrastate
shippers
and
so,
there
was
some
suggestion
in
the
government's
original
complaint
that
there
might
be
a
violation
of
the
interstate
commerce
clause.
we
make
no
such
argument
here.
that
point
has
been
dropped
out
of
the
case,
if
it
had
any
merit.
we
certainly
don't
press
it
now.
so,
i'm
speaking
of
the
implied
sovereign
immunity
without
regard
to
interstate
commerce.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
this
case,
we
think,
falls
within
the
immunity,
we
assert,
as
a
general
proposition
that
a
state
may
not
directly
regulate
a
contract
of
the
united
states,
whether
the
statute
is
formally
addressed
to
the
united
states
or
not.
if
it
is
formally
addressed
to
the
united
states,
it
makes
it
more
dramatic
but
we
think
the
real
point
is
whether
the
--
in
terms
addressed
to
the
united
states
or
otherwise,
the
state
is
attempting
to
regulate
a
contract
of
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
was
covered
by
stewart
&
company
against
sadrakula
and
that
it
was
not
a
violation
of
the
implied
immunity.
safety
equipment,
the
other
things
that
he
does
in
his
relations
with
the
outside
work,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
although
i
include
his
employees
as
the
outside
world,
i
mean
the
world
other
than
the
united
states,
are
up
to
him
and
if
we
bear
--
this
would
be
true
even
under
a
cost-plus
contract,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
if
we
choose
to
do
our
business
in
such
a
way
that
there
is
no
slack
and
that
the
burden
of
the
minimum
wage
bears
directly
on
us,
we
can't
claim
immunity
on
that
ground.
that's
the
king
&
boozer
case
as
applied
to
a
sales
tax,
and
i
think
the
same
would
clearly
be
true
in
this
instance
with
respect
to
regulation.
also,
i
don't
want
to
tie
the
two
together
completely.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
the
second
--
that
comes
directly
to
the
united
states.
we're
no
longer
one
step
remote
and
i
would
think
that
it
was
clearly
done,
not
permissible
for
the
state
to
do
that,
unless
congress
chooses
to
waive
the
implied
immunity
because
the
court
--
i
want
to
make
two
points.
i
will
try
to
develop
each.
one
point
that
i
wish
to
make,
and
i'll
turn
to
it
in
a
moment,
is
that
this
court
has
always
been
careful,
except
in
the
penn
dairies
case,
to
preserve
a
distinction
between
regulating
the
contracts
of
the
united
states
and
regulating
the
activities
of
the
contractor
in
relation
to
his
employees
or
his
dealing
with
other
independent
businesses.
it
is
repeatedly
said
that
the
contracts
may
not
be
taxed
or
regulated.
second,
it
seems
to
us,
and
i'm
going
to
develop
the
argument,
that
all
the
reasons
that
apply
to
cases
like
arizona
and
california,
where
it
was
held
that
the
state
could
not
require
that
the
dam
plans
be
approved
for
a
federal
dam,
are
equally
applicable
to
a
case
like
this
georgia
utilities
regulation
case.
now,
if
i
might
deal
first
with
the
authorities
and
then
expand
to
the
reasons,
the
first
instance
to
which
this
distinction
between
regulating
contracts
and
regulating
the
contractors
was
drawn
was
in
the
well-known
case
of
railroad
company
against
peniston
in
18
wallace
and
in
mr.
justice
bradley's
opinion.
there
--
from
there,
he
said,
“the
case
differs
toto
coelo
from
that
wherein
the
government
enters
into
a
contract
with
an
individual
or
corporation
to
perform
services
necessary
for
carrying
on
the
functions
of
the
united
states,
such
as
for
carrying
the
mails,
or
troops,
or
supplies,
or
for
building
ships
or
works
for
government
use.
in
those
cases
the
government
has
no
further
concern
with
the
contractor
than
in
his
contract
and
its
execution.
it
has
no
concern
with
his
property
or
his
facilities
independent
of
that.
how
much
he
may
be
taxed
by,
or
what
duties
he
may
be
obliged
to
perform
towards
his
state
is
of
no
consequence
to
the
government,
so
long
as
his
contract
and
its
execution
are
not
interfered
with.
in
that
case
the
contract
is
the
means
employed
for
carrying
into
execution
the
powers
of
the
government,
and
the
contract,
and
not
the
contractor,
is
exempt
from
taxation
or
other
interference
by
the
state
government.”
this
passage
--
the
distinction
was
not
observed
in
many
years,
as
the
court
then
began
to
contract
the
scope
of
the
implied
governmental
immunity.
this
passage
was,
quite
frequently,
relied
upon
by
the
court
and
always,
i
think,
with
the
same
distinction
in
mind
that
i
draw
here
in
the
landmark
case
of
james
against
dravo
contracting
company.
chief
justice
hughes
quoted
this
passage
at
some
length.
it
was
quoted
in
the
city
of
detroit
case,
i
think
in
justice
frankfurter's
opinion.
the
same
role
was
stated,
indeed,
laid
down
as
part
of
the
holding
by
justice
reed
for
the
court
in
the
curse
--
in
the
cursed
scurlock
case
in
which
the
--
excuse
me,
kern-limerick
company
against
scurlock
in
which
the
court
held
that
a
state
could
not
tax
the
purchases
of
the
united
states.
there
was
a
dissent
upon
the
question
of
whether
purchase
is
made
by
a
contractor
as
agent
for
the
united
states.
the
goods
that
were
going
to
be
consumed
in
the
course
of
his
performance
as
a
contractor
was
really
a
purchase
by
the
united
states,
but
there
was
no
disagreement
with
the
proposition
that
a
tax
on
a
purchase
of
the
united
states
would
be
an
invalid
tax.
now,
it
seems
to
us
they're
quite
apart
from
the
weight
given
to
this
distinction
in
the
courts
opinions,
that
also
as
a
matter
of
principle
or
reason,
the
state
should
not
have
the
power
to
regulate
the
contract
of
the
united
states,
that
is
the
actual
terms
of
what
the
government
may
get
from
the
contractor
or
what
the
government
has
to
give
the
contractor.
i
think
the
reasons
that
i
am
going
to
stress
are
the
same
reasons
that
support
the
general
statement
that
a
state
may
not
directly
tax
or
regulate
the
property,
transactions,
or
activities
of
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
suppose
that,
in
that
case,
the
substance
of
the
contract
might
control
over
the
form.
i
don't
think
that's
my
case.
i
think
that
is
a
problem,
is
it
not,
a
form
in
substance.
the
substance
is
that
the
relations
of
the
contractor
with
his
employees
are
being
governed.
if
there
were
an
effort
to
make
the
government
or
the
private
party
in
the
case
of
private
construction
responsible
for
the
payment
of
those
wages
in
the
event
that
the
contractor
did
fail
to
do
it,
then
i
would
say
that
was
invalid.
i've
been
a
little
troubled
about
the
reverse
case,
justice
stewart,
but
i
think
to
put
it
illustrates
the
distinction
i
tried
to
get.
suppose
that
the
government
put
into
its
contract
with
the
private
contractor,
a
stipulation
that
he
wouldn't
pay
laborers
more
than
$1.50
an
hour
because
it
thought
the
state
rates
were
outrageous.
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
then
that
the
substance
should
control
that
this
wasn't
a
matter
of
what
the
united
states
gets
or
what
consideration
it
pays
directly
but
rather
was
an
attempt
to
expand
out
into
this
indirect
area.
and
therefore,
i
would
not
think
--
we
don't
have
the
case
and
i
don't
want
it
commit
anybody
for
the
future
but
intellectually,
i
would
think
that
my
argument
should
not
extend
that
far,
that
i'm
really
concerned
with
what
we
get
or
what
we
immediately
pay
and
that,
if
you
can
visage
these
terms
in
contracts
that
attempt
to
control
more
remote
relations
that
they
prop
--
that
they
pose
a
somewhat
different
case
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
the
mere
increase
in
cost
is,
if
the
impact
is
indirect,
is
not
alone
enough.
that
is
set.
that
is
clear
from
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
in
the
minimum
wage
case
that
i
gave
justice
goldberg.
mr.
archibald
cox
what?
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
i
think
it
involves
something
more
than
increased
cost.
it
involved
an
attempt
to
regulate
the
contract
of
the
united
states
and
in
a
different
sense
than
i
think
in
your
case.
for
example,
suppose
that
a
state
provides,
by
statute,
that
no
construction
company
within
arizona
shall
sign
a
contract
for
the
construction
of
a
dam
that
does
not
contain
plans
and
specifications
which
have
been
approve
by
the
state
dam
commission.
clearly,
that
is
just
as
much
an
interference
with
the
activities
of
the
united
states.
as
a
statute,
it
says
no
one
shall
build
a
dam
that
hasn't
been
approved.
and,
i
think
this
direct
and
indirect
is
hard
to
articulate
but
the
way
that
i
have
put
it
to
myself,
and
i
submit
that
it
has
merit,
is
that
your
case
is
different
because,
also
in
form
it
has
been
made
a
part
of
the
contract
between
the
contractor
and
the
united
states,
in
substance,
it
really
has
to
do
with
the
contractor's
relations
with
somebody
else.
now,
i
think
perhaps
one
can
put
this
in
words
by
saying
that
if
the
state
attempts
to
regulate
what
the
united
states
gets
or
what
the
united
states
itself
pays
out,
that
then,
it
is
a
direct
regulation
of
the
contract
within
my
rule
that
in
the
other
cases
may
be
not.
that's
the
best
i've
been
able
to
do
in
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
will
be
perfectly
clear
that
the
government
was
not
subject
if
it
does
the
work
itself.
of
course,
it
has
been
stated
on
several
occasions
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
state
regulation
of
the
activities
of
the
government
is
a
violation
of
the
implied
immunity,
is
that
it
may
interfere
with
the
performance
of
federal
functions
through
independent
contractors.
in
one
case,
it
--
the
language
expressly
speaks
of
an
invalid
statute
as
being
one
that
would
affect
or
embarrass
in
any
substantial
measure
the
power
of
the
united
states
to
secure
aid
from
independent
contractor.
that's
not
one
of
the
older
discredited
cases
and
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
here
is
that
these
--
that
a
regulation
of
the
contract
does
embarrass
the
united
states
in
--
or
may
embarrass
the
united
states
in
carrying
out
its
activities
it
--
through
independent
contractors.
and,
i
mentioned
earlier
i
think
that
it's
equally
an
interference
with
the
government's
activities
for
the
state
to
say
“you
shall
not
build
a
certain
kind
of
building”
or
“you
shall
not
erect
a
certain
kind
of
dam”
or
to
say
that
“no
contractor
shall
contract
to
build
a
certain
kind
of
building
or
to
erect
a
certain
kind
of
dam.”
now,
of
course,
the
degree
of
interference
will
obviously
vary
from
case
to
case.
in
the
illustrations
that
i
have
used,
i
have
been
putting
cases
where
what
the
government
actually
gets
is
building
a
dam
or
some
other
public
work
is
affected
--
would
be
affected
by
the
state
regulation.
but
in
the
california
utilities
case,
if
one
had
gone
to
the
general
constitutional
point
that
i'm
now
relying
on,
there
would've
been
a
very
clear
argument
that
to
apply
the
state
utilities
rates
to
government
shipments,
government
bills
of
lading,
of
military
paraphernalia
would
directly
interfere
with
the
movement
of
military
traffic.
that's
a
very
dramatic
description
of
that
in
justice
douglas'
opinion.
now,
that
--
on
the
fact
of
it,
justice
goldberg,
looked
as
if
it
was
simply
rate
regulation.
but
in
fact,
it
had
these
other
indifferent
consequences.
i
said
here
that
there
were
interferences.
most
of
them
end
up
in
money
but
they
are
not
immediately
money.
for
example,
if
the
50
states
are
empowered
to
regulate
these
transfers
of
government
properties,
civilian
or
military,
then
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
united
states
to
deal
with
50
state
commissions
to
have
numerous,
i
guess
not
50
but,
numerous
different
forms
of
bill
of
lading,
numerous
different
tariffs
to
compute,
and
it
would
require
a
very
substantial
complication
in
the
already
large
transportation
units
in
the
government.
take
as
another
illustration,
remember
we
are
not
dealing
simply
with
the
rate
here.
we
also
have
this
georgia
regulation
saying
that
you
must
ship
on
a
uniform
household
goods
bill
of
lading
and
that
only
one
family's
goods
may
be
accepted
as
a
single
shipment.
that
has
a
good
many
consequences.
for
one
thing,
it
would
make
it
necessarily,
apparently,
to
weigh
each
shipment
separately,
each
family's
goods
separately.
sometimes,
the
government
arranges
terms
that
don't
involve
weighing
the
shipments
at
all.
other
times,
they
can
be
weighed
on
men.
here
again,
there
is
trouble,
expense,
and
possible
delay.
if
there
must
be
an
individual
bill
of
lading
for
each
family,
consider
the
consequences
if
you're
moving
500
military
personnel
or
civilian
personnel
in
the
defense
department.
instead
of
what
i'm
told,
it
would
be
about
one
hour
to
prepare
a
single
bill
of
lading,
you
would
have
to
prepare
500
bills
of
lading.
it
wouldn't
be
500
hours.
i'm
told
that
if
we're
done
on
that
scale,
it
would
be
about
15
minutes
per
bill
of
lading
but,
instead
of
one-hour's
work,
you're
now
in
125-hours
work.
and,
this
is
just
in
preparing
the
bill
of
lading,
going
through
for
processing
it
through
payment,
withdrawing
the
checks
and
so
forth.
but
now
i
should
agree,
of
course,
that
in
the
end
those
things
are
money
and
they
usually
hire
more
people
from
the
government,
but
it's
trouble
and
delay
as
well.
second,
the
bill
of
lading
contains
substantive
terms
and
the
government
bill
of
lading
contains
terms
that
differ
from
those
under
the
uniform
bills
of
lading
act.
i'll
take
two
as
illustrations.
the
uniform
bill
of
lading
normally
contains
a
time
limit,
with
--
within
which,
any
claims
must
be
presented
for
damage
to
or
loss
of
the
goods.
that
time
limit
is
not
--
it's
not
the
same
in
the
government
bill
of
lading
and,
if
my
memory
is
right,
there's
none
there
at
all.
this
is
the
substantive
term
that
isn't
just
money.
mr.
archibald
cox
they're
--
none
of
them
--
none
of
them
discriminatory,
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
--
no,
i
don't
think
that
--
well,
i
don't
really
--
i
can't
--
i
don't
argue
that
they
are
unreasonable.
i
do
argue
that
they're
significant.
let
me
give
one
last
illustration.
the
government
--
you
know,
the
government
bill
of
lading
now
contains
quite
uniformly
a
clause
requiring
the
carrier
to
stipulate
that
he
won't
engage
in
any
kind
of
discrimination
and
employment
by
reason
of
race
and
color
under
the
precedent
executive
order.
of
course,
no
such
clause
is
in
the
uniform
bill
of
lading
and
perhaps
we
could
find
some
other
way
of
putting
it
in.
also,
it's
not
altogether
clear
to
me
because
most
utilities
regulation
says
you
can't
add
to
the
requirement.
so,
this
is
not
solely
a
matter
of
money
at
all.
now,
i
submit
that
there
is
no
distinction
between
regulating
the
terms
on
which
the
united
states
may
contract
and
the
terms
on
which
one
may
contract
with
the
united
states.
a
contract
is
a
relationship.
it's
an
integral
chain.
and
i
think
to
face
up
to
it
squarely,
that
the
great
fault
in
the
penn
dairies
opinion,
which
is
out
of
keeping
with
the
--
which
is
contrary
to
the
line
of
authority
that
i
read,
is
that
it
doesn't
deal
--
not
only
that
it
doesn't
deal
with
this
difficulty
satisfactorily,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it
doesn't
face
up
to
it
at
all,
that
when
you
regulate
the
terms
on
which
one
party
may
contract
with
the
other,
you
necessarily
regulate
the
terms
on
which
the
other
party
may
contract
with
the
first.
you
can't
prevent
john
from
marrying
mary
without
preventing
mary
from
marrying
john.
the
two
with
--
it's
an
integral
thing.
it's
like
if
you
turn
over
the
face,
the
adverse
side
of
the
coin,
you
necessarily
turn
over
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin.
and
if
you
--
so
here,
if
you
regulate
the
price
the
utility
must
charge,
you
necessarily
and
inevitably
regulate
the
price
which
the
government
must
pay.
indeed
in
this
particular
case,
unlike
penn
dairies
that
i
really
don't
think
i
understand
on
this
distinction,
in
this
particular
case,
the
government
has
to
have
the
intrastate
shipment
made
by
carrier
permitted
to
do
business
in
georgia
and
therefore,
by
carriers
operating
under
the
regulations
of
the
georgia
utilities
commission,
unless
there's
a
sovereign
immunity.
in
the
penn
dairies
case,
the
court
adverts
to
the
possibility
that
the
federal
government
might
have
bought
milk
outside
pennsylvania
and
brought
it
in.
in
the
california
case,
that's
a
practical
matter
than
pennsylvania.
in
the
california,
that
is
only
a
theoretical
possibility
that
they'll
bring
milk
over
the
sierras.
and
in
this
case,
it's
an
absolute
impossibility
because
anybody
carrying
goods
in
georgia
intrastate
is,
according
to
georgia,
subject
to
the
regulation.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
you
said
“may
congress
waive.”
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
haven't
thought
of
that
argument,
but
i'd
be
glad
to
embrace
it.
i
think
it's
a
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
it's
a
distinction,
but
i
really
think
with
thrust
of
penn
dairies.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
against
them.
there's
no
--
i
simply
--
my
main
point
is
that
i
think
that
it's
--
it
just
overlooks,
at
least
it
doesn't
deal
with,
i
shouldn't
say
overlooks
perhaps,
the
fact
that
when
you
regulate
one
side
of
the
contract,
you
inevitably
regulate
the
other
side.
there's
no
play
in
the
joints.
i
do
submit
that
that
has
to
be
dealt
with
before
one
can
get
the
--
possibly
get
the
penn
dairies
result.
now,
i've
attempted
in
arguing
this
point
of
the
implied
constitutional
immunity
this
far,
i'm
afraid
it's
a
somewhat
scattered
way,
to
cover
three
points,first,
precedence,
second,
the
argument
that
a
regulation
of
a
contract
of
the
united
states
does
directly
interfere
with
the
activities
of
the
united
states
and,
third,
that
a
regulation
of
the
terms
on
which
one
may
contract
with
the
united
states
is
necessarily
and
inevitably
a
regulation
of
the
terms
on
which
the
united
states
may
contract
with
the
other
party.
there
is
one
final
point
that
i
would
like
to
deal
with.
i
said
earlier
that
the
reasons
that
support
the
view
that
the
united
--
that
the
state
may
not
directly
regulate
or
tax
the
property
activities
or
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
are
applicable
here.
the
third
one
comes
--
and
the
third
point
comes
to
grips
more
immediately
with
this
matter
of
an
economic
burden.
part
of
my
answer
is
that
what
appears
to
be
only
an
economic
burden
is
often
much
more,
and
that
one
can't
really
distinguish
between
wholly
economic
burden
and
those
that
have
to
do
with
what
the
united
states
does,
as
i
tried
to
suggest
with
the
size
of
the
iron
beams
or
the
character
of
the
fireproof,
but
i
would
urge
to
the
court
that
there's
an
important
difference
here.
that,
the
cases
contracting
the
extent
of
the
sovereign
immunity,
which
was
recognized
in
some
of
the
earlier
cases
like
o'keefe
against
graves
and
the
panhandle
oil
case
and
the
indian
motorcycle
case,
that
the
reasons
for
contracting
that
are
not
applicable
here
and
that
the
usual
statement
summarizing
the
net
effect
of
those
cases
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
proposition
that
we
espouse
here.
but
the
usual
statement
is
to
the
effect
that
a
state
regulation
or
tax
upon
one
doing
business
with
the
united
states
is
not
unconstitutional
merely
because
it
imposes
an
economic
burden
on
the
united
states.
now
i
submit,
your
honors,
that
that
is
quite
different
from
saying
that
if
the
only
effect
of
a
direct
regulation
of
the
united
states
is
economic
and
nondiscriminatory,
then
the
state
may
do
it,
but
those
are
two
entirely
different
things.
something
which
is
not
a
regulation
of
the
united
states
but
has
an
economic
--
puts
an
economic
burden
on
the
united
states
because
of
the
economic
enterprise
is
different
from
something
that
is
a
regulation
of
the
united
states
and
puts
an
economic
burden
on
it
or
is
a
tax
on
the
united
states
and
puts
an
economic
burden.
the
general
property
tax
is
an
illustration
of
that.
i
suppose
it's
purely
economic.
now,
the
broad
immunity
which
the
earlier
cases
or
the
middle
cases,
began
to
recognize
was
cut
down
i
suppose,
basically,
for
three
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
extending
it
to
the
activities
of
everyone
who
did
business
with
the
united
states,
as
the
number
of
people
doing
business
with
the
united
states
increased,
it
began
to
cut
off
important
sources
of
state
revenue.
state
income
taxes
on
any
federal
employee
or
--
income
tax
on
a
contract
with
a
government
would've
been
invalid.
a
second
reason,
i
take
it,
was
that
this
threatened
to
create
sort
of
a
class
of
especially
favored
citizens
who
because
they
did
business
with
the
federal
government,
were
immune
from
state
regulation.
and
a
third
reason,
which
i
think
is
important,
is
that
you
really
didn't
know
in
those
cases
just
who
was
getting
the
benefit
of
this
immunity,
that
in
the
general
run
of
it,
it
was
quite
likely
that
part
of
the
immunity
was
really
going
to
the
benefit
of
private
persons
and
not
affecting
the
united
states.
for
example,
in
income
tax,
the
immunity
from
state
income
tax
on
a
contractor
who
is
doing
government
work,
you
really
didn't
know
how
much
of
that
had
been
--
would
be
passed
on
to
united
states
or
how
much
he
would
just
pocket
the
difference
himself.
i
submit
that
these
reasons
are
not
applicable
to
a
case
where
the
state
is
attempting
to
regulate
a
contract
of
the
united
states.
the
terms
on
which
the
united
states
may
buy
or
sell
the
product
it
gets,
the
way
the
goods
are
carried,
things
of
that
kind
because,
in
those
cases,
there
is
no
play
in
the
joint.
it's
--
i
don't
know
whether
the
--
these
analogies
are
helpful
or
hurtful
but
i've
thought
of
this
as
one
often
does
with
direct
and
indirect
like
the
links
of
a
chain.
if
you
yank
on
the
contractor
by
making
him
pay
the
tax
or
by
making
him
pay
minimum
wages,
if
it
affects
the
united
states,
there
may
be
some
play
or
a
cost-plus
contract,
the
chain
is
already
tongued.
but,
in
the
general
run
of
cases,
this
role
played
the
joint.
but
if
you
regulate
the
terms
on
which
one
may
contract
with
the
united
states,
the
effect
on
the
other
party
in
the
contract
is
immediate
and
indissoluble.
it's
as
if
you
had
only
one
link.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
an
attempt
to
regulate
the
contract
of
the
united
states.
i
think
your
honor
states
the
question
a
little
too
broadly.
i
suppose
that
a
state,
if
it
saw
fit,
could
protect
the
contractor
by
saying
that
he
shall
not
pay
more
than
certain
maximum
wages
against
the
--
protect
him
against
the
excessive
demands
of
labor
union.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
you
might
have
either
kind
of
law.
i
would
say
that
the
kind
of
law
i
used,
is
notably,
would
be
valid
for
the
reasons
i've
stated.
i
think,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
the
--
my
answer
to
you
is
correct
and
i
think
that
one
has
to
face
up
to
the
proposition
that
there
are
times
where
the
governmental
immunity
may
have
consequences
which
do
not
seem,
in
the
particular
case,
to
be
desirable.
i
would
concede
that
that
is
true.
for
example,
if
the
immunity
did
extend
all
the
way
to
the
producer
prices
in
the
california
milk
case,
i
think
that
the
--
i
know
that
the
executive
branch
would
consider
that
as
undesirable
result
and
something
was
done
about
it
in
this
instance.
in
other
words,
the
general
--
it
seems
to
me,
the
general
principle
that
a
state
may
not
regulate
the
activities
of
the
united
states
is
a
sound
one
and
a
specific
problem
for
the
policy
making
branches
of
the
government
to
deal
with
by
waiving
the
immunity
or
as
a
matter
of
policy,
insisting
on
compliance
with
the
state
law.
i
don't
think
the
court
can
say
that,
“well,
we
think
the
rate
regulation
in
the
california
utilities
case
was
unsound,
but
we
think
it
is
a
sound
regulation
in
the
georgia
case.”
i
think
that,
in
general,
it
is
a
sound
principle
until
congress
acts
that
these
direct
attempts
to
regulate
the
activities
of
the
united
states
or
contracts
of
the
united
states
should
be
immune.
they
historically
have
been
immune,
and
we
submit
that
they
should
be
held
immune
here.
the
few
minutes
i
have
left
may
i
reserve,
mr.
chief
justice?
