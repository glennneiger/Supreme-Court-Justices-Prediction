mr.
paul
rodgers
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
briefly
recapitulating
what
i
say
to
be
some
of
the
significant
facts
in
this
case.
the
first
fact
is
that
this
involves
the
movement
of
the
household
goods
of
nine
families.
this
movement
of
the
household
goods
was
from
savannah
to
atlanta,
georgia.
the
movement
was
strictly
intrastate
commerce.
these
household
goods
are
owned
and
used
only
by
employees
of
the
united
states
department
of
health
and
they
are
not,
in
any
way,
owned
or
used
by
the
united
states.
this
movement
originated
and
terminated
at
the
private
dwellings
of
the
employees.
there
is
no
question
of
session
involved
in
this
case
or
any
area
over
the
united
states
exercise
its
jurisdiction
exclusively
like
a
federal
reservation.
thirteen
of
these
carriers
submitted
bids.
common
carriers
submitted
bids
in
response
to
an
invitation
of
the
federal
procurement
officer.
now,
each
of
these
carriers
was
required
--
was
required
to
apply
under
state
law
the
higher
commission
tariff.
there
are
two
tariffs
in
georgia.
there's
a
higher
tariff
and,
as
i
say,
the
lower
tariff.
each
of
those
was
required
to
apply
the
higher
tariff.
eight
of
those
carriers
did
apply
such
a
tariff.
five
of
them
cut
their
rates.
the
lowest
one,
insofar
as
the
government
was
concerned,
was
consolidated
van
&
storage
companies
incorporated.
consolidated
bid
a
substantially
lower
rate.
however,
what
consolidated
bid
is
approximately
the
same
or
lesser
rate
than
prescribed
by
the
lower
georgia
tariff.
now,
at
the
time
this
movement
was
made,
there
was
in
effect
a
lower
georgia
tariff
which
was
available
to
the
united
states
which
the
united
states
did
not
use.
and
so,
because
of
that
fact,
i
do
not
believe
the
government
could
even
make
a
clear
showing
of
an
economic
burden
on
the
fact
that
is
presented
with
this
case.
now,
of
course,
in
the
argument
on
the
merits,
we
assume
that
there
is,
for
the
sake
of
argument,
an
economic
burden
and
i
believe
it's
a
safe
assumption
because
this
type
of
state
regulation
is
permitted
then,
of
course,
they
will
affect
to
some
extent
an
economic
burden
upon
the
united
states.
in
setting
this
case
for
argument,
this
court
requested
that
counsels,
in
addition
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
address
themselves
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
now,
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
the
district
court
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
law
on
three
grounds.
first
of
them
was
direct
violation
of
several
clauses
of
articles
1
and
4
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
second
ground
was
an
unreasonable
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
and,
the
third
ground
was
the
conflict
with
a
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
of
1949
and
supplemental
regulations.
now,
obviously,
grounds
one
and
two,
if
they
are
good
grounds,
would
of
course
give
this
court
jurisdiction
independently.
of
course,
the
question
i'm
addressing
myself
to
is
whether
or
not
the
complaint
alleged
a
question
of
unconstitutionality
within
the
meaning
of
section
2281
of
the
u.s.
code
title
28.
now,
the
first
two
grounds
would
involve
direct
violations.
however,
after
the
case
began
and
after
the
court
--
the
three-judge
court
was
convened,
pursuant
to
a
motion
for
a
more
definite
statement
being
granted,
the
thrust
of
the
government's
complaint
was
limited
or
sharpened
to
where
it
just
involved
the
carriage
of
the
household
goods
and
personal
effects
of
a
personnel
of
the
united
states
in
intrastate
commerce
within
the
state
of
georgia.
and,
of
course,
the
goods
involved
in
this
particular
case
were
the
goods
of
employees
of
united
states
department
of
public
health.
now,
based
upon
such
a
sharpening
of
the
complaint,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
clauses
which
were
alleged
to
be
violated
in
article
1
and
4
are
any
longer
relevant.
such
clauses
are
the
congressional
power
to
establish
host
roads
to
raise
and
support
armies,
to
provide
and
maintain
a
navy,
to
provide
for
the
militia,
to
exercise
exclusive
legislation
of
a
real
property
held
by
session,
and
to
make
all
need
for
rules
and
regulation
respecting
property
belonging
to
the
united
states.
i
believe
the
sharpening
of
complaint
defeats
those
constitutional
attacks.
the
second
one
is
the
burden
on
intra
--
on
interstate
commerce
had
been
abandoned
by
the
united
states.
i
believe
it
was
somewhat
farfetched
to
begin
with.
now,
third
ground,
which
i
believe
is
independently
gives
this
court
jurisdiction,
is
a
conflict
between
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
of
1949
and
the
georgia
statutes.
and,
of
course,
the
georgia
statute
is
--
two
of
those
is
68-613
and
68-614
of
the
georgia
code.
613
empowers
a
state
commission
to
prescribe
rates
to
motor
common
carriers
and
614
prohibits
common
carriers
from
discriminating
as
to
rates
and
services.
now,
the
parties,
the
united
states
and
georgia
commission,
have
resolved
between
themselves
any
preliminary
questions
of
statutory
construction
which
would
address
themselves
to
a
state
court.
as
between
these
statutes,
there
is
a
clear
and
definite
conflict
and,
because
of
that,
i
believe
this
case,
on
that
ground,
presents
a
sole
immediate
constitutional
question
as
defined
by
this
case
--
as
defined
by
this
court
in
kesler
versus
department
of
public
safety
and,
of
course,
if
you
recall,
that
case
recently
decided
that
this
court
involved
an
alleged
conflict
between
utah
financial
responsibility
act
and
the
federal
bankruptcy
act.
and
it's
interesting
to
note
that
that
conflict
there
--
that
no
conflict
was
found
to
exist,
the
federal
and
state
regulation
was
found
by
this
court
to
be
compatible.
next,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
merits.
now,
the
united
states
allows
more
federal
acts.
this
movement
was
made
and
illustrated
by
the
complaint
and
illustrated
by
the
clear
terms
of
the
statute.
this
movement
was
made
on
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
of
1949
and
was
not
made
under
their
armed
services
procurement
act
which
was
involved
in
the
public
utilities
case,
and
by
public
utilities
case,
i
mean
the
california
decision
--
the
california
public
service
decision
written
by
this
court
in
1958.
now,
the
procurement
provisions
between
those
two
statutes
are
quite
similar.
substantively,
there's
no
difference.
however,
what
is
significant
is
some
accompanying
provision
contained
in
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
of
1949.
however,
before
a
banning
in
the
armed
services
procurement
act,
our
consideration
of
that,
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
1962
amendments
of
the
armed
services
procurement
act
which
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
state's
reply
brief
in
paul
versus
united
states,
the
case
you
just
heard.
and
in
the
1962
amendments
to
the
armed
services
procurement
act,
there
were
some
additional
safeguards
established
for
federal
procurement,
and
in
that,
in
those
additional
amendments,
the
congress
was
careful
to
expressly
state
that
it
would
not
affect
rates
established
by
law
or
regulation,
which
i
believe
is
consistent
with
the
policy
of
federal
procurement
throughout,
except
where
there
are
definite
interferences
of
the
federal
function
which
were
involved
in
the
public
utilities
case.
mr.
paul
rodgers
you
mean
between
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
now,
the
basis
of
that
--
in
the
public
utilities
case,
i'll
cover
this
more
fully
later
on
but,
i'll
answer
your
question
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
to
put
it
in
a
nutshell,
in
public
utilities,
there
were
involved
military
movement.
the
movement
of
war
material
and
a
state
regulation
there
violated
the
secrecy
requirement
and
the
speed
requirement
of
military
transportation.
and,
also,
you
had
a
state
statute
there
that
was
formally
addressed
the
united
states
and
said
the
united
states,
that
you
can
have
law
raised
only
if
we
submit
ourselves
to
your
jurisdiction,
and
the
court
--
this
court
has
never
tolerated
that
type
of
state
legislation.
i
think,
on
those
considerations,
there
was
a
direct
interference
of
the
federal
contract
whereas,
in
this
case,
the
effect,
if
any,
is
economic
and
its
indiscriminant
and
it
does
not
limit
the
united
states
in
moving
these
household
goods
in
any
way
except
imposed
an
indiscriminant
economic
burden.
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes,
sir.
i
distinguished
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
you
mean
on
--
in
the
case
of
household
goods
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
--
in
distinguishing
the
movement
of
military
material?
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes.
i
think
that
the
nature
of
the
commodity
transport
is
very
important
as
well.
i
think
a
very
important
distinction
is
found
there.
now,
as
to
the
derivation
of
the
statute,
now,
i
have
set
forth
in
appendix
a
of
brief,
the
statute
--
the
federal
procurement
statute
which
were
in
effect
when
penn
dairies
was
decided,
now,
you
--
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
and
the
armed
services
procurement
act
were
both
derived
from
those
provisions
in
penn
dairies.
and,
subsequently
--
i
believe
the
court
will
find
that,
subsequently,
there's
no
difference.
and
i
think
that
brings
into
play
an
important
rule
of
construction
which
this
--
which
is
well-recognized,
and
that
is
when
the
highest
court
has
interpreted
statutory
language
which
is,
again,
reenacted
in
subsequent
legislation.
the
congress,
the
legislative
body,
is
held
to
know
of
the
construction
plates,
the
one
that
i
believe
--
i'm
sure
they
did
because
of
penn
dairies,
the
landmark
case,
and
who
have
adopted
that
judicial
interpretation
in
the
enactment
of
the
subsequent
statutes.
now,
the
penn
dairies
case
is
almost
tailor-made
for
disposing
this
case
for
this
provision
of
this
case.
and,
if
you
will
permit
me,
i
would
like
to
read
several
--
a
couple
of
excerpts.
the
court
stated,
in
penn
dairies,
it
is
to
be
noted
that
while
these
statutes
direct
government
officials
to
invite
competitive
bidding
--
that's
the
federal
statute,
they
direct
government
officials
to
invite
competitive
bidding
by
contractors
undertaking
to
furnish
army
supply
and
also
require
them
to
accept
the
lowest
response
for
a
bid,
if
any
is
accepted.
they
do
not
purport
to
set
aside
local
price
regulations
or
to
prohibit
the
states
from
taking
punitive
measures
for
violations
of
such
regulation,
that
was
referred
to
as
the
contract
--
the
prior
contractor.
evidence
is
warning
that
congress,
in
authorizing
competitive
bidding,
has
been
so
concerned
with
securing
the
lowest
possible
price
for
articles
furnished
to
the
government
that
it
wish
to
set
aside
all
local
regulations
affecting
price.
on
the
contrary,
congress
has
regarded
the
field
of
public
contracts
as
one
of
which
to
exercise
its
supervisory
--
legislative
powers
in
safeguarding
interests
which
may
conflict
with
the
needs
of
the
government
used
solely
as
purchase.
an
unexpressed
purpose
of
congress
to
set
aside
statutes
of
the
states
regulating
their
internal
affairs
is
not
likely
to
be
inferred
and
ought
not
to
be
implied
with
a
legislative
command,
read
in
the
light
of
its
history,
remains
ambiguous.
now
of
course,
that
statement
there
calls
into
play
a
comment
made
by
the
solicitor
general,
and
he
states
that,
historically,
the
government
procurement
contracts
have
been
immune
from
any
effect
of
the
state
regulation,
but
you
have
the
decision
in
penn
dairies
in
1942
which
is
clearly
against
that.
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
--
how
you
can
obtain
any
historical
justifications
from
the
precedence
established
by
this
court.
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
“it
would
be
no
more
than
speculation
for
us
to
say
that
congress
would
consider
the
government's
pecuniary
interest
as
a
purchaser
of
milk
more
important
than
the
interest
asserted
by
pennsylvania
in
the
stabilization
of
her
milk
supply
through
control
of
price.
now,
we
find
an
easy
analogy
there
between
the
state
interest
in
procuring
a
pure
milk
supply,
and
the
state's
interest
in
establishing
a
sound
--
an
economically
sound
transportation
system.
now,
as
far
as
deriving
the
regression
you
can
from
other
acts,
we
find
there
are
many
acts
that
congress
has
adopted
which
are
solitary
which
have
a
sound
economic
effect
in
this
nation
but
viewed
from
the
government's
position
strictly
as
a
purchaser.
they
may
be
thought
to
be
adverse
when
viewed
in
that
limited
context,
but
to
view
the
impact
in
the
national
economy,
the
government's
purchasing
power,
congress
has
only
used
that
purchasing
power
as
a
--
to
have
ebullient
effect
on
the
national
economy.
for
instance,
you
have
your
buy
american
act,
providing
for
preference
in
use
of
american-produced
goods
on
all
public
works
contracts.
as
to
labor,
we
have
the
eight-hour
law,
the
davis-bacon
act,
and
the
walsh-healey
act
which
fix
sanitary
standards,
governing
the
form
of
labor
on
public
contract.
there's
also
a
long
history
of
legislation
whereby
congress
authorizes
various
instrumentality
to
provide
the
payment
in
lieu
of
taxes.
the
tennessee
valley
authority,
the
department
of
interior,
the
atomic
energy
commission,
saint
lawrence
seaway
development
corporation,
and
many
other
federal
departments
are
authorized
in
their
dealings
throughout
the
nation,
where
if
they
were
a
private
enterprise,
they
would
be
taxed
to
make
payments
because
it's
the
law
of
the
tax
department
to
make
payments
to
your
state
and
local
governments
and
there,
again,
we
can
see
a
congressional
regard
for
the
needs
and
the
requirements
of
state
and
local
government
and,
of
course,
that
philosophy
--
that
congressional
philosophy
is
consistent
with
the
philosophy
that's
filed
to
this
court
in
its
tax
decisions.
mr.
paul
rodgers
off
hand,
i
do
not
recall
any
that's
directed
to
material,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
rodgers
no
charged
services,
except
of
course,
at
the
effect
that
i
think
that
penn
dairies
plays
in
construing
current
federal
procurement
statutes.
now
--
returning
now
to
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
of
1949,
there
are
various
provisions
in
there
which
to
my
mind
indicate
the
congressional
intent
that
federal
procurement
under
that
statute
would
be
subject
to
state
economic
regulation.
one
of
them
is
found
in
section
201
(a)
which
authorizes
the
administrator,
with
respect
to
transportation
of
the
public
utility
services,
for
the
use
of
the
executive
agencies
to
represent
these
agencies
in
proceeding
the
involvement
of
carriers
or
other
public
utility
before
federal
and
state
regulatory
bodies.
now,
the
solicitor
general's
brief
tends
to
discount
that
by
saying,
“well,
that's
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
administrator,
so
it
doesn't
really
mean
anything.”
but,
it
strikes
me
as
odd
that
if
there
was
congressional
intent
that
your
state
regulatory
agency
would
have
absolutely
no
control
over
federal
procurement
or
no
effect
on
it,
i
should
say,
or
a
federal
procurement
strikes
me
as
odd,
they
would
have
an
expressed
provision,
they
are
authorizing
appearances
before
a
state
regulatory
commission.
and
of
course,
we
also
have
a
well-recognized
policy
that's
present
in
both
acts
--
both
procurement
acts,
and
that
is
that
a
fair
proportion
of
government
procurement
will
go
to
small
business.
now,
of
course,
it's
a
well-recognized
economic
fact,
or
at
least
to
begin
with
anyway
that
big
business
can't
supply
cheaper
prices
than
small
business,
but
yet,
the
government
goes
out
of
its
way
to
favor
small
business,
so
that
aspect
of
our
economy,
the
small
business
aspect
of
our
economy
will
not
become
extinct.
and
of
course,
you
have
the
executive
devices
to
stimulate
the
economy
where
they
are
financial
set-asides
for
labor
surplus
areas,
for
major
disaster
areas,
and
of
course
also
for
small
business.
then,
section
203
(g),
we
find
extensive
provisions,
two
sections
devoted
to
the
fact
that
in
dispose
of
the
government
surplus,
that
it
will
in
no
way
impede
the
government's
price
support
programs
in
the
agricultural
area,
and
the
administrator
is
directed
to
coordinate
his
activities
with
the
secretary
of
agriculture
in
such
a
manner
to
where
the
agricultural
price
stabilization
programs
of
the
federal
government
would
not
be
adversely
affected.
and
then,
we
go
on
to
the
next
section,
section
502
(d),
which
i
think
is
very
significant
and
that
section
reads
in
court
“nothing
in
this
act
shall
impair
or
affect
any
authority
of
any
executive
agency,”
i
refer
to
federal
executive
agency,
“to
any
executive
agency
with
respect
to
any
favors
of
any
program
conducted
for
purposes
of
resale,
price
support,
grants
to
farmers,
stabilization,
etcetera,
or
rehabilitation.”
now,
i
believe
these
provisions
of
course
indicate
a
very
clear
desire
on
the
part
of
congress
to
take
advantage
of
economic
regulation
to
not
--
to
disturb
that.
now,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
says,
in
effect,
well
all
that
may
be
well
and
good
but
that
does
not
apply
to
state
economic
regulation.
well,
i
believe
that
the
implication
is
clear
that
it
does.
i
believe,
if
it
doesn't,
i
respectfully
submit
that
congress
is
suffering
from
schizophrenia.
if
on
the
one
hand
it
has
a
dr.
jekyll
and
mr.
hyde
complex,
if
in
one
hand
it
protects
federal
courts,
federal
economic
regulation
but
on
the
other
hand,
slashes
and
disfigures
state
economic
regulation.
to
me,
the
two
forces
are
entirely
inconsistent
and
i
think
the
implications
from
this
act
are
clear
that
state
economic
regulation,
where
it
doesn't
impose
any
direct
interference
with
the
federal
government,
is
to
be
abided
by
for
the
welfare
of
the
national
economy,
and
as
i
hope
to
show
to
your
satisfaction
later,
to
the
welfare
providing
a
strong
transportation
system
in
this
nation
which
of
course
enhances
the
national
defense
of
this
nation.
now,
i
believe
that
the
doctrine
espoused
by
this
type
of
--
by
the
solicitor
general,
this
doctrine
espoused
is
--
to
describe
it
succinctly,
is
pennywise
and
pound-foolish
because
i
do
not
believe
it's
the
intention
of
congress
that
federal
procurement
officers
should
engage
in
cutthroat
competition
which
has
a
detrimental
effect
upon
the
national
economy.
now,
moving
on
to
the
effect
of
penn
dairies
decisions,
the
penn
dairies
decision
and
that
is,
in
that
case,
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
in
the
interest
of
protecting
its
milk
supply
and
in
the
interest
of
providing
a
pure
milk
supply,
promulgated
certain
minimum
rates
so
that
supply
would
be
enhanced.
and
of
course,
this
court
held,
i
think
wise
and
so
soundly
so,
that
that
regulation
should
apply
to
the
federal
government
because
all
in
effect,
all
it
did
was
imposed
an
economic
burden.
now,
it
looks
like
to
me
that
in
this
--
what
the
solicitor
general
says
that
what
we're
trying
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
dictate
the
term
of
the
government
contract,
i
think
that
that
is
the
language
is
too
strong
for
this.
i
don't
think
that
it's
applicable.
i
believe
that
this
had
just
as
much
effect
upon
the
regulation
of
the
federal
contract
in
that
case
as
it
does
in
this
case,
and
it
is
--
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
regulation
of
the
federal
contract.
i
believe
it
has
an
effect
upon
it
but
it
does
not
regulate
it.
now,
the
solicitor
general
relies
heavily
upon
the
peniston
case,
a
case
decided
--
not
upon
the
peniston
case.
he
relies
heavily
upon
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
peniston,
justice
bradley's
standing
opinion
which
has
received
some
added
dignity
because
it
has
been
referred
to
a
couple
of
times
in
cases
fairly
recently.
but
it
is
a
dissenting
opinion.
the
holding
in
the
peniston
case,
i
think,
militates
against
the
solicitor
general
because
it
upheld
state
taxation
of
the
property
of
a
federal
instrumentality
and
also
the
peniston
case
is
decided
in
the
last
century.
but,
i
think
that
this
--
that
the
regulation
here
in
penn
dairies
does
not
dictate
the
terms
of
the
federal
contract
any
more
than
it
does
say
--
where
a
state
law
requires
the
payment
of
minimum
wages.
you
could
say
just
as
easily
there
that
the
state
is
dictating
the
terms
of
the
federal
contract
and
for
that
matter
to
the
tax
cases
because,
of
course,
in
every
--
the
--
an
economic
burden
is
imposed
on
the
federal
government,
that
right
there
affects
the
terms
of
the
contract.
so
of
course,
under
the
solicitor
general's
theory,
there
right
there
dictates
the
terms
of
the
contract
and
that
theory
is
sound
by
the
attorney
general,
then
he
recall
for
a
tremendous
realignment
of
the
decisions
of
this
court,
not
only
the
tax
field
but
in
these
other
regulatory
fields
as
well.
and
of
course
this
court,
just
recently
this
past
month
in
illinois'
tax
case,
has
again
reaffirmed
its
position
as
the
tax
case
is
about
economic
burden,
incidental
and
indirect
economic
tax
burden
being
imposed
upon
the
federal
government.
it
has
upheld
that
as
a
result
of
state
taxations.
now,
as
to
the
application
to
penn
dairies,
i'd
like
to
read
a
couple
of
excerpts.
there
is
no
qualm
to
the
constitution
which
purport,
unaided
by
congressional
enactment,
to
prohibit
such
regulations.
and
the
question
with
which
we
are
now
concerned
is
whether
such
a
prohibition
is
to
be
implied
from
the
relationship
of
the
two
government
established
by
the
constitution.
now,
in
this
aspect
of
the
penn
dairies
opinion,
the
court
is
addressing
itself
to
this
doctrine
of
implied
governmental
immunity.
the
court
goes
on
to
say
the
mere
fact
that
nondiscriminatory
taxation
or
regulation
of
the
contract
impose
an
increased
economic
burden
on
the
government
is
no
longer
regarded
as
bringing
the
contract
within
any
implied
immunity
of
the
government
for
state
taxation
or
regulation.
the
trend
of
our
decisions
is
not
to
extend
governmental
immunity
from
state
taxation
or
regulation
beyond
the
national
government
itself
and
governmental
functions
performed
by
its
officers
and
agents.
we
recognize
that
the
constitution
presupposes
the
continued
existence
of
the
state's
functioning
in
coordination
with
the
national
government
with
authority
in
the
states
to
lay
taxes
and
to
regulate
their
internal
affairs
and
policy.
and
a
state
regulation
like
state
taxation
inevitably
imposes
some
burdens
on
the
national
government
of
the
same
kind
of
those
imposed
on
citizens
of
the
united
states
within
the
state's
burden.
since
the
congress
has
--
since
the
constitution
has
left
congress
free
to
set
aside
local
taxation
and
regulation
of
government
contractors
which
burden
the
national
government,
we
see
no
basis
for
implying,
from
the
constitution
alone,
a
restriction
upon
such
regulations
which
congress
is
not
seen
fit
to
impose,
unless
the
regulations
are
shown
to
be
inconsistent
with
congressional
policy.
even
the
case
of
agencies
created
or
appointed
through
government's
work,
we
have
been
slow
to
infer
an
immunity
from
congress
which
congress
has
not
granted
and
which
congressional
policy
does
not
require.
now,
consistent
with
the
philosophy
reflected
in
penn
dairies,
we
find
the
same
philosophy
in
the
tax
cases,
the
dravo
case,
where
the
court
reached
the
same
conclusion
even
on
the
assumption
that
tax
burden
would
be
passed
upon
the
federal
government.
again,
there's
a
clearer
definition
of
that
doctrine,
alabama
versus
king
&
boozer,
that
say
all
of
these
tax
cases
are
consistent
with
the
case
rendered
--
the
decision
rendered
by
this
court
on
this
past
monday.
now,
justice
holmes
in
the
panhandle
case,
which
was
subsequently
--
the
majority
decision
of
which
was
subsequently
repudiated
in
alabama
versus
king
&
boozer,
justice
holmes
wrote
one
of
his
famous
dissenting
opinions
and
a
couple
of
excerpts
from
that
opinion,
i
think,
apropos
to
us
in
this
case.
the
first
is
to
come
down
more
closely
to
the
question
before
us,
when
the
government
comes
into
a
state
to
purchase,
i
do
not
see
why
it
should
be
entitled
to
stand
differently
from
any
other
purchaser.
it
avails
itself
with
the
machinery
furnished
by
the
state
and
i
do
not
see
why
it
should
not
contribute
in
the
same
proportion
that
every
other
purchaser
contributes
for
the
privileges
that
it
uses.
it
has
no
better
or
other
right
to
use
them
than
anyone
else.
the
cost
of
maintaining
the
state
that
makes
a
business
possible
is
just
as
necessary
in
the
element
of
the
cost
of
production
as
labor
or
code.
the
question
of
interference
with
the
government,
i
repeat,
is
one
of
reasonableness
and
degree,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
interference
in
this
case
is
too
remote.
now,
that
dissent
of
justice
holmes
subsequently
became
the
majority
decision
of
this
court
and
it's
continued
as
such
until
this
day.
now,
another
case
which
i
think
is
significant
is
the
esso
standard
oil
company
case
versus
evans.
that's
another
tax
case.
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
the
constitutional
doctrine
of
implied
intergovernmental
immunity
does
not
invalidate
a
state
privileged
tax
in
(inaudible)
storing
gasoline,
measured
by
the
quantity
of
gasoline
stored
as
applied
to
a
contract
of
the
united
states
who
store
gasoline
owned
by
the
federal
government.
i
think
that
these
tax
cases
should
logically
apply
with
even
stronger
effect
in
the
case
of
regulation,
the
case
that
we're
presently
with
anyway,
and
even
in
the
tax
cases,
of
course
the
court,
in
the
tax
cases,
the
money
collected
by
the
state
goes
directly
to
the
state
treasury
and,
of
course,
that
goes
to,
ultimately,
to
strengthening
the
vitality
and
soundness
of
state
and
local
government.
but
at
the
same
time,
the
--
any
economic
burden
sustained
by
the
united
states
in
the
case
before
us
goes
directly
to
strengthening
the
transportation
system
--
the
intrastate
transportation
system
which
is
used
by
the
united
states
as
well
as
for
private
use,
and
there
is
a
more
direct
benefit
in
return
achieved
in
these
type
of
cases,
i
think,
and
even
in
the
tax
cases.
so
i
think,
logically,
the
philosophy
of
the
tax
cases
should
apply
with
even
greater
force
in
cases
of
this
nature.
now,
to
move
on
to
the
public
utilities
case,
now,
the
case
there
and
i
think
to
get
the
full
impact
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
that
case,
it's
well
to
begin
with
the
decision
of
the
district
court
because
the
district
court
wrote
a
very
long
opinion
in
that
case.
and,
the
district
court
was
very
much
impressed
with
the
conflict
between
the
interest
of
national
defense
and
state
regulation.
i
have
quoted
that
extract
somewhat
at
length,
in
my
brief.
i'll
refer
to
a
few
on
the
specific.
the
court
said,
“in
this
atomic
age,
speed
in
the
movement
of
men
and
supply
is
vitally
necessary.
it
would
greatly
impeded
the
discharge
by
the
united
states
of
its
constitutional
power
and
responsibilities
by
inevitably
causing
delays
in
such
shipments
when
time
is
of
the
essence.
and
in
many
situations,
would
expose
to
the
public
patterns
of
movement
and
traffic
which
would
be
subject
to
interpretation
by
the
intelligence
agents
of
foreign
powers
and
might
jeopardize
the
security
of
the
united
states.”
then,
of
course,
the
court
goes
on
and
comment
upon
the
fact
that
the
regulation
in
public
utilities,
this
california
regulation,
california
statute
was
formerly
addressed
to
the
united
states
specifically
and
sought
to
bring
the
united
states
under
the
heels,
so
to
speak,
of
state
regulations.
and,
it
goes
on
to
this
unique
type
of
economic
discrimination,
this
unique
type
of
rate
discrimination
that
was
inherent
in
the
public
utilities
case.
now
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
no,
sir,
not
to
military
supplies.
that
--
we
only
interpret
our
regulation
as
applied
to
the
movement
of
household
goods
and
personnel
of
the
united
states.
we
do
not
interpret
our
regulation
at
all
applied
to
the
movement
of
military
supplies.
i
believe
that
question
has
been
foreclosed
by
the
public
utilities
decision
and,
of
course,
we
do
not
challenge
that
at
all.
we
do
not
challenge
public
utilities.
we
seek
to
distinguish
public
utilities
because
we
do
not
think
that
public
utilities
is
designed
to
govern
cases
of
this
nature,
the
movement
of
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
of
course
that's
not
involved
here
but
i
would
think
that
would
be
on
the
same
--
that
would
fall
in
the
same
classification
of
household
goods
to
these
employees
because,
of
course,
our
military
defense
is
not
intended
upon
the
rapid
movement
of
the
household
goods.
in
fact,
frequently,
the
servicemen
are
sent
overseas.
we'd
have
to
wait
quite
a
long
time
before
we
get
the
household
goods
over
there,
and
i
don't
think
the
movement
of
household
goods
has
ever
been
interpreted
as
being
vitally
necessary
to
the
national
defense,
of
course,
it
makes
some
contribution
to
the
morale
and
that
i
think
they
should
be
moved.
but
i
think
then,
when
you
balance
these
two
things
in
relation
to
the
national
welfare,
i
believe
the
federal
government's
interest
in
having
a
strong
intrastate
transportation
system
is
more
vital
to
the
economy
of
the
nation
and
to
the
national
defense
than
the
rapid
movement
of
household
goods.
of
course,
i
think
that
under
our
regulation,
this
household
goods
can
be
moved
rapidly
anyway.
but
i
would
--
i
don't
see
any
real
justification
or
distinguish
between
the
household
goods
or
military
personnel
and
to
these
employees.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
i
think,
on
the
constitutional
as
to
the
implied
immunity,
it
turns
upon
the
degree
of
interference.
and,
i
think
the
degree
of
interference
to
a
large
extent
is
dependent
upon
the
commodity
moved.
now,
of
course,
it's
one
thing
for
state
regulation
to
slow
down
or
to
destroy
the
seeker's
requirements,
say,
on
the
movement
of
guided
missiles
and
quite
another
for
state
regulation
to
have
an
effect
upon
the
movement
of
household
goods.
in
other
words,
i
think
there
has
to
be
a
weighing
of
degree
in
the
constitutional
sense.
mr.
paul
rodgers
because
of
the
degree
of
interference,
yes.that's
correct
and
that
is
as
to
the
implied
immunity.
of
course,
i
think
that
this
does
not
violate
the
implied
immunity.
i
think
even
we
assume
to
say,
just
for
the
sake
of
further
consideration,
that
there
is
an
implied
immunity,
i
think
that
the
federal
legislation
is
such,
that
it
indicates
a
clear
indication
that
that
immunity
should
not
apply
in
procurements
of
this
nature.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
if
there
is
no
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
then
i
would
try
--
i
would
then
say,
well
--
you
mean
a
--
i
would
say
then
that
you
thought
that
violated
the
implied
immunity
of
the
united
states,
i
would
say
then
that
this
movement
here
is
on
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
which
would
cause
these
related
provisions,
required
on
this
context,
a
different
result
as
to
household
goods
and
the
movement
of
military
supplies
under
the
armed
services
procurement
act,
and
that
it
was
the
intention
of
congress,
as
reflected
by
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act
to
waive
any
immunity
that
the
united
states
might
have.
that
would
be
my
second
line
of
defense.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
that's
--
what
we
say
--
we
say,
first,
that
state
regulation
does
not
conflict
with
congressional
policy.
we
say
second,
that
congressional
policy
is
actually
on
the
side
of
state
regulation
in
this
case.
and
we
say
thirdly,
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
implied
immunity
of
the
united
states
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well
now,
the
california
case
only
involved
the
armed
services
procurement
act.
this
movement
here,
made
in
this
case,
is
made
on
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act.
so
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
well
i
think
of
course,
the
procurement
provisions
are
substantially
the
same,
however,
i
think
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
federal
property
and
administrative
services
act,
which
indicate
much
more
clearly
than
the
armed
services
procurement
act,
that
congress
intended
that
procurement
of
this
nature
be
regulated
by
state
regulation.
and
of
course,
even
as
to
the
armed
services
procurement
act,
congress
has
just
passed
the
1962
amendment
to
that,
whereby
it
set
up
additional
safeguards
for
armed
services
procurement
and
made
those
safeguards
--
made
exceptions
though
as
to
cases
where
the
prices
were
set
by
law
or
regulation.
but,
getting
back
to
the
public
utilities
litigation,
we
find
that
--
getting
back
to
this
economic
discrimination
that
was
being
suffered
by
the
united
states.
now,
your
usual
commodities
in
movement
--
your
usual
commodities
for
transportation
in
this
nation
is
like
household
goods
and
things
of
that
nature,
there
has
been
commodity
rates
promulgated
for
that,
and
those
commodity
rates
--
oh,
i
think
my
time
is
up.
mr.
paul
rodgers
thank
you,
sir.
may
it
please
the
court.
where
we
left
off
involved
a
consideration
of
the
litigation
in
the
public
utilities
case
and
i
was
just
getting
to
the
point
about
the
unique
economic
discrimination
that
the
united
states
was
being
subjected
to
in
that
case.
now,
we
all
know
that
your
military
supplies,
materials
of
war,
are
somewhat
exotic,
they
are
not
the
usual
items
for
transportation
for
which
commodity
rates
had
been
established
for.
now,
your
civilian
goods,
just
about
always,
move
at
commodity
rates,
which
are
somewhat
lower
than
your
class
rates.
now,
the
class
rates
are
devised
to
satisfy
legal
requirement.
in
other
words,
every
carrier,
every
regulatory
agency
promulgates
rates
which
apply
to
any
kind
of
shipment
anywhere
at
any
time.
for
instance,
i
think
one
illustration
used
by
general
lasher,
a
witness
for
the
government
in
the
public
utilities
litigation
who
made
the
comparison
of
the
shipment
of
oranges
from
maine
to
florida
when,
of
course,
no
movements
like
that
ever
occur
but
there's
a
rate
for
it,
and
that
rate
is
high.
so
because
they
were
not
commodity
rates
promulgated
governing
the
shipment
of
exotic
military
supplies
and
war
materials,
the
government,
if
it
complied
with
state
regulation,
would
be
forced
to
comply
--
to
pay
these
higher
class
rates
which
you
civilian
shippers
were
not
subjected
to.
now
of
course,
involved
in
our
case
is
household
goods
which
is
a
frequent
item
of
transportation
and
which
all
regulatory
agencies
have
promulgated
rates
for.
and,
you
do
not
have
that
economic
discrimination
inherent
in
this
case.
going
on
reviewing
this,
general
lasher
testified,
nothing
must
be
placed
as
an
impediment
to
the
complete
flexibility
and
flow
of
movement
of
supplies
to
our
troops
in
foreign
theaters
whether
it's
in
peace
or
in
war.
going
on,
there
are
many
items
which
move
today,
which
are
not
described,
some
items
which
are
willfully
misdescribed
in
order
to
hide
their
identity,
and
their
moving
in
quantity.
were
we
have
to
go
through
a
regulatory
body,
we
would
never
be
able
to
accomplish
this.
and
there's
also
great
emphasis
on
the
testimony
of
the
district
court
placed
upon
the
secrecy
requirements.
on
the
subject
requiring
secrecy
in
certain
cases,
coronel
hall
stated
that
reeling
over
a
period
of
time
every
military
shipment
is
in
a
sense
a
security
shipment.
coronel
hall
added
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
possible
to
reveal
unnecessary
data
for
logical
and
reasonable
rate
approval
purposes
in
connection
with
many
of
the
shipments,
which
are
secret
in
nature.
if
everything
is
made
public,
we
might
as
well
publish
it
in
the
newspapers.
and
the
decision
based
upon
this
in
this,
this
court,
and
i
think
quite
frankly
so
found
a
definite
conflict
because
of
the
requirements
--
the
secrecy
requirements
and
the
speed
requirements
of
transporting
military
goods,
it
found
that
california's
regulation
for
program
of
regulation
seriously
interfered
with
that.
and
because
of
that
distinction,
i
believe,
and
also
this
economic
discrimination,
this
court
reached
the
result
it
did
in
public
utilities.
but,
in
reaching
that
result,
this
court
carefully
distinguished
penn
dairies,
carefully
distinguished
esso
standard
oil
company
versus
evans,
dravo,
king
&
boozer.
it
carefully
distinguished
all
of
those
cases
and
preserved
that
policy
which
has
been
reaffirmed
since
then,
time
established
with
those
cases.
also,
it's
interesting
to
note
that
on
the
same
day
this
case
--
that
this
case
decided
public
utilities,
it
decided
three
more
cases
--
united
states
versus
city
of
detroit,
the
united
states
versus
township
of
muskegon,
detroit
--
and
also
city
of
detroit
versus
murray
corporation
of
america.
and
in
those
cases,
taxes
were
imposed
upon
individuals
having
leased
government-owned
property
and
revive
the
leases
that
any
economic
burden
derived
in
the
state
tax
may
be
passed
onto
the
federal
government.
but
yet,
all
three
of
those
cases,
this
court
in
the
same
day
decided
public
utilities
and
handed
down
those
three
decisions
and
also
in
the
city
of
detroit
case,
justice
black
commented
approvingly
upon
the
penn
dairies
case.
now,
in
the
brief,
the
solicitor
general
places
great
reliance
upon
kern
limerick,
inc.
versus
scurlock.
well
now,
that
case
right
there
is
entirely
consistent
with
penn
dairies,
with
king
&
boozer
because
in
that
case,
by
virtue
of
drawing
the
federal
contract,
the
tax
--
where
the
state
tax
was
being
imposed
directly
upon
the
federal
government
and
this
court
has
never
tolerated
any
such
as
that
and
because
of
that,
the
kern
limerick
decision
falls
in
line
with
the
rest
of
these
decisions
and
they
placed
great
reliance
upon
arizona
versus
california.
well
in
that
case
there,
the
state
--
in
the
construction
of
a
federal
dam,
the
state
tended
to
have
a
hand
in
the
prescription
and
specifications
for
the
construction
of
that
dam,
but
of
course,
the
federal
government
cannot
tolerate
that
because
you
cannot
tolerate
the
imposition
of
state
standards
on
the
construction
of
a
dam.
just
in
the
case
of
johnson
versus
maryland,
the
state
tried
to
have
a
hand
in
determining
the
qualification
of
persons
who
could
drive
federal
mail
trucks.
well,
all
of
that
right
there
is
a
direct
interference
as
distinguished
from
the
indirect
effect
--
indirect
economic
effect
in
this
case
because,
in
our
case,
there
is
no
prohibition
upon
the
movement
of
the
household
goods.
the
federal
government
move
household
goods
in
such
volume
whenever
and
wherever
it
pleases.there's
no
impediment
there,
nothing
but
the
indirect
economic
burden
which
has
been
sustained
numerous
times
by
this
court.
now,
i
would
like
to
devote
the
next
few
minutes
to
a
consideration
of
these
noneconomic
burdens
which
the
solicitor
general
asserts.
now
of
course,
i
believe
he
places,
and
i
think,
a
great
emphasis
on
these
noneconomic
burdens
because
i
believe
that
the
trend
of
decisions
as
to
the
economic
burden
is
quite
clear.
he
says
one
thing.
for
instance,
he
refers
to
the
uniform
bill
of
lading.
now,
that
tariff
provision
is
at
page
85
of
the
brief
for
the
united
states
and
he
says,
“now,
state
law
requires
that
there'd
be
a
uniform
bill
of
lading
on
each
shipment.”
then,
he
moves
on
from
that
and
he
says,
“and
that's
going
to
take
the
federal
government
a
great
deal
of
time,”
but
that's
against
the
clear
terms
of
the
tariff
provisions.
the
tariff
provision
places
the
responsibility
of
making
that
uniform
household
goods
bill
of
lading
on
the
carrier,
not
upon
the
federal
government.
the
obligation
is
placed
upon
the
carrier.
the
federal
government
is
not
burdened
with
that.
the
carrier
must
provide
the
uniform
bill
of
lading.
the
government
goes
ahead
and
issues
its
government
bills
of
lading
as
before.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
government
issues
one
or
100.
that's
completely
unrelated
to
this
requirement
of
uniform
bill
of
lading
that's
imposed
upon
the
carrier
and
not
the
federal
government.
and
then,
he
goes
on
to
say,
“well,
there's
a
conflict
between
the
gbl,
the
government
bill
of
lading,
and
the
uniform
bill
of
lading.”
he
only
referred
to
two
things.
first
that
he
said
was
that
the
uniform
bill
of
lading
specified
at
the
time
which
claims
must
be
presented,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
gbl.
well,
i
don't
see
any
conflict.
i
think
the
provisions
--
i
think
the
two
bills
of
lading
on
that
basis
are
compatible.
he
has
another
one
as
to
discrimination,
i
believe,
he
referred
to
in
the
gbl.
well,
that's
certainly
compatible.
there's
no
state
law
requiring
otherwise,
and
the
two
bills
of
lading
are
entirely
compatible.
the
next
provision
he
tried
try
to
assert
a
noneconomic
burden,
first,
this
provision
about
the
property
of
two
or
more
families
or
establishments
will
not
be
accepted
for
transportation
as
a
single
shipment.
now,
that
right
there
is
designed
as
to
rate
regulation.
it
doesn't
mean
there
must
only
be
the
household
goods
to
one
founded
place
at
one
truck
at
one
time.
that
regulation
there
is
designed
at
the
economic
--
in
other
words,
you
can't
combine
that
with
other
shipments
and,
thereby,
try
to
get
a
lower
rate
because
that's
rate
discrimination,
but
that's
--
all
it
means
is
that
each
shipment
must
be
considered
separately
for
pricing
purposes,
for
figuring
the
rate.
now
of
course
if
you're
going
to
move,
say
in
this
case
like
nine
families
from
savannah
to
atlanta,
there
must
be
an
evaluation
of
the
weight
of
each
family.
in
any
system
of
transportation,
you've
got
to
have
some
mechanism
for
keeping
the
goods
straight.
you
can't
steer
one's
household
goods
together
and
then
try
to
pick
them
out
of
the
journey,
especially
going
to
nine
different
places
in
atlanta,
the
goods
must
be
kept
separate.
as
far
as
paperwork
is
concerned,
there
must
be
an
individual
weight
determined
for
each
one
and
when
that
weight
is
determined,
it's
just
as
easy
to
apply
the
state
rate
as
it
is
a
rate
achieved
otherwise.
so
i
say
that
the
economic
burden
--
that
the
noneconomic
burdens
asserted
by
the
solicitor
general
upon
examination
of
this
are
nonexistent.
we
go
on
now
to
this
next
one
about
--
in
the
next
one,
he
says
--
he
goes
onto
the
next
one
and
he
says
“now,
if
we
have
to
follow
the
state
regulation,
we
may
have
to
comply
with,
say,
50
state
systems.”
when
now,
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
this
cutthroat
competition,
so
to
speak,
that
the
government
desire
to
stimulate
or
how
the
solicitor
general
desire
to
stimulate
these
cases,
then
of
course,
the
federal
procurement
office
are
going
to
be
continually
advertising,
formally
advertizing.
they
are
going
to
continue
to
be
negotiating
contracts
and
renegotiating,
and
those
contracts
and
the
rates
they
provide
for
are
going
to
be
as
(inaudible)
and
vary,
as
there
are
a
number
of
carriers
seeking
to
do
business
for
the
government
in
intrastate
commerce.
contrasted
to
that
is
if
you
have
state
regulations.
you
have
a
relatively
few
number
of
rates
which
must
be
applied.
so
actually,
the
burdens
are
far
less
upon
federal
procurement
officers.
this
thing
about
having
to
apply
with
state
regulatory
systems
is
actually
simpler
than
this
process
of
continually
seeking
competitive
bids
and
continually
negotiating.
now
they
go
--
he
tried
to
go
on
to
say
that
--
well,
even
though
we
have
competition,
even
though
the
government
procures
its
transportation
and
the
competition
ignores
state
regulation,
well,
that's
not
going
to
really
affect
the
returns
of
the
carriers
anyway
because
returns
have
already
been
sent.
now,
they
set
that
up
but
that
is
plainly
economically
fallacious
because
once
a
return
is
set
to
give
a
fair
return
to
a
carrier,
if
he
attempts
to
do
business
in
an
unregulated
segment
and
does
not
follow
state
rate
regulation,
if
he
cuts
rate,
then
clearly
that's
going
to
adverse
--
adversely
affect
the
return.
and
they
say
--
and
of
course,
in
some
cases,
we
may
have
to
pay
more
than
a
state
rate.
well,
that's
entirely
hypothetical
and
i
believe
that
if
any
group
of
carriers
ever
got
together
and
tried
to
enforce
a
higher
rate
upon
the
federal
government
than
what
civilian
shippers
have
to
pay,
i'm
sure
then
that
the
solicitor
general
would
become
an
advocate
of
state
regulation.
i'm
sure
they
would
say
then
to
the
carriers
“don't
you
know
you're
regulated
by
state
--
the
state
commission?
don't
you
know
you're
violating
your
rates?”
and
i
believe
that
--
and
of
course,
furthermore,
that's
hypothetical.
also,
as
far
as
this
talk
about
exceeding
the
demand,
exceeding
the
capacity
and
had
to
pay
more
for
it,
i
think
it's
a
practical
matter
from
the
very
nature
of
the
business.
i
doubt
if
any
carrier
ever
would
be
in
the
position,
whereby
he'd
have
to
go
out
and
buy
new
trucks
because
there
are
large
firms
in
this
nation
to
make
a
business
of
leasing
trucks
of
a
common
carrier.
and
so,
for
a
big
job,
a
carrier
has
available
to
these
companies
where
he
can
lease
additional
trucks,
and
expand
and
contract
his
capacity
as
the
bid
increases
and
decreases.
now,
i
hope
that
i
have
shown
the
court
satisfaction.
there
is
no
significant
economic
burden
--
a
noneconomic
burden
to
speak
of.
however,
in
the
case
davies
warehouse
company
versus
bowles,
there
was
a
significant
noneconomic
burden
placed
upon
a
federal
administrator.
in
that
decision
this
court
stated,
and
i'd
like
to
read
a
couple
of
excerpts,
“simplicity
of
administration
is
a
merit
that
does
not
inhere
in
a
federal
system
of
government,
as
it
is
claimed
to
do
in
a
unitary
one.
a
federal
system
makes
a
merit,
instead,
of
the
very
local
autonomy
in
which
complexities
are
inherent.”
the
existence
and
force
and
function
of
established
institutions
of
local
government
are
always
in
the
consciousness
of
lawmakers,
and
while
they're
weight
might
vary,
they
may
never
be
completely
overlooked
in
the
task
of
interpretation.
at
a
time
when
great
measures
of
concentration
of
direction
are
concededly
necessary,
it
may
be
thought
more
farsighted
to
avoid
paralyzing
or
extinguishing
local
institutions,
which
do
not
seriously
conflict
with
the
central
government's
place.
congress
has
given
no
indication
that
it
would
draw
all
such
state
authority
into
the
vortex
of
the
war
power,
nor
should
we
rush
the
trend
to
centralization
where
congress
has
not.
now
next,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
this
criminal
statute
facet
of
the
case.
the
solicitor
general
then
says
--
now,
there's
a
criminal
provision
which
states
that
anyone
aiding
or
abetting
in
the
violation
of
these
statutes
is
subject
to
a
misdemeanor
and
consequently
if
our
federal
procurement
officers
were
caught
doing
such
a
thing,
we
would
be
--
they
would
be
imprisoned.
but,
i
think
that
is
clearly
fallacious.
i
think,
furthermore,
an
examination
of
the
criminal
statute
and
the
california
criminal
statutes,
the
statutes
are
quite
different.
the
california
criminal
statutes
are
far
more
extensive,
far
more
sophisticated
in
their
application.
they
actually
made
--
they
actually
pointed
those
statutes
to
persons
involved
in
non-utility
businesses.
the
breadth
of
those
statute
is
much
clear
than
georgia
statute.
now,
i
think,
interpretation
of
georgia
statute
would
be
governed
by
such
cases
as
united
states
versus
farrar
and
others,
united
states
versus
gebardi.
united
states
versus
farrar
held
that
a
person
who
purchased
intoxicating
liquors
under
a
federal
act
was
not
the
one
that
the
act
was
designed
against.
and
the
purchaser
was
not
covered
by
the
act.
it
was
just
the
seller.
and,
i
think
that
gebardi
versus
united
states,
the
board
of
prosecution
on
the
mann
act
held
there
they
federal
--
that
the
criminal
statute
was
not
applicable
to
a
woman.
it
was
the
procurer
that
the
criminal
statute
is
aimed
at.
i
think
the
same
interpretations
here
can
be
placed
upon
the
georgia
statutes.
but
even
if
we
can
see
everything
that
the
solicitor
general
said
as
to
the
breadth
of
the
criminal
statute,
i
think
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
a
noneconomic
--
i
mean
an
economic
--
an
incidental
economic
burden
being
imposed
on
the
united
states,
that
does
not
interfere
with
the
federal
function.
and
in
comparison
to
that,
the
imprisonment
of
a
federal
official,
so
that
right
there,
very
clearly
is
an
interference
with
the
function
of
the
federal
government.
and
this
court
has
never
tolerated
such
interference
as
that
and,
so
long
as
it
sits,
i'm
sure
it
never
will.
and
very
clearly,
no
state
has
the
authority
to
imprison
a
federal
official.
now
cases
like
that
which
were
(inaudible)
johnson
versus
maryland,
they
held
the
arrest
of
that
postal
employee
was
illegal.
in
ohio
versus
thomas
where
you
had
the
governor
of
this
federal
soldier's
home,
they
held
his
arrest
for
not
displaying
a
state
oleomargarine
sign
is
illegal
and
also
in
neagle,
which
is
a
famous
case
where
a
federal
marshal
shot
a
man,
killed
the
man
in
self-defense
of
a
justice
of
this
court.
but
in
case
after
case,
it's
quite
clear
that
these
state
criminal
statutes
cannot
apply
to
federal
officials
and
that
no
state
has
the
authority
to
imprison
a
federal
official.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well,
that's
another
--
i'm
glad
you
mentioned
that.
the
georgia
--
it
has
never
been
construed
by
the
courts.
this
act
right
here
was
passed,
i
think,
in
1932.
the
georgia
public
service
commission
has
never
construed
this
thing
applicable
to
the
shipper.
i
mean
this
case's
problem
is
you
never
construe
it
applicable
to
the
shipper
and
the
prosecution
--
there
had
been
many
prosecutions
under
this,
they
have
--
those
prosecution,
if
i
had
not
been
involved
in
many
myself,
those
prosecutions
have
been
directed
to
the
carrier
and
not
to
the
shipper.
and
i
think
--
and
of
course,
that
constitutes
an
administrative
interpretation
that
the
statute
is
not
applicable
to
shippers.
mr.
paul
rodgers
no,
sir.
no
--
there's
no
state
decision
on
it
but,
of
course,
i
think
it's
clear
that
that's
beyond
the
power
of
any
state
to
imprison
a
federal
official.
now,
as
to
this
regulation
by
georgia,
the
regulation
of
intrastate
transportation,
this
regulation
is
the
type
of
regulation
that's
been
adopted
by
just
about
all
the
states.
it's
not
unique.
it's
a
standard
guarding
variety
type
of
regulation.
and
of
course,
we
have
what
it
affected
here,
not
only
georgia's
program
of
intrastate
regulation,
we
have
that
of
the
other
states
as
well.
i
see
my
--
yes,
sir?
mr.
paul
rodgers
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
rodgers
well
--
mr.
paul
rodgers
i
don't
know.
i
was
not
assigned
as
counsel
at
that
time
to
the
commission.
i
think
it
was
somewhat
--
i
think
the
federal
government
should've
been
afforded
a
hearing,
but
apparently,
they
already
made
up
their
mind
as
to
what
the
law
was.
i
think
that's
rather
the
sharp
practice.
i
think,
as
you
said,
i
don't
believe
that's
really
relevant
to
this.
mr.
paul
rodgers
but
i
was
not
assigned
as
counsel
to
the
commission
at
that
time.
and
i'm
not
sure
just
what
the
reasoning
was
behind
that.
now,
drawing
on
to
the
three
basic
distinctions
between
public
utilities
and
penn
dairies
--
now,
the
first
one
is
by
the
very
address
of
the
state
legislation
itself.
the
state
--
california
state
regulation
said
the
state
commission
may
permit
common
carriers
to
transport
property
with
reduced
rates
of
the
united
states
to
such
extent
and
subject
to
such
conditions
as
it
may
consider
just
and
reasonable.
well,
that
is
a
former
address.
that
singles
out
the
united
states
and
points
to
it.
now
in
an
economic
sense,
and
of
course
that's
how
the
solicitor
general
attempts
to
push
this
over,
economically,
this
is
really
more
favorable
to
the
state
than
georgia's
regulation.
but
in
the
constitutional
sense,
it's
offensive
because
the
united
states
is
singled
out,
and
it's
made
the
expressed
subject
of
state
regulation.
the
imposition
is
no
longer
indirect,
indiscriminant,
or
incidental.
it
is
then
direct
and
this
court
has
never
tolerated
that
kind
of
state
legislation.
and
of
course,
i
believe
i've
covered
the
next
distinction
already
and
that
is
that
the
difference
in
the
commodity
transported,
and
the
third
one
was
the
economic
discrimination
because
of
the
variation
between
class
and
commodity
rates.
but
i
would
like
to
say,
in
closing,
that
we
have
here
a
state
regulation
on
the
yard
before
this
court
today.
it
has
a
broad
base.
most
of
the
states
have
it.
it's
a
solitary
force
for
providing
--
it
enhances
the
national
economy.
it's
a
solitary
force
for
enhancing
the
national
defense.
and
congress
has
shown
no
disposition
to
interfere
with
it.
congress
has
shown
the
disposition
to
protect
it
and
i
say
this
nation
cannot
afford
to
be
--
to
have
that
type
of
regulation
interfered
with
and
it
would
be
substantially
because
the
government
is
the
greatest
spender
in
the
nation
and
the
economic
force
of
this
government
is,
of
course,
tremendous
in
all
the
state
price
support
programs
which
have
ebullient
effect
upon
the
national
economy
and
the
national
defense.
thank
you
for
your
attention.
