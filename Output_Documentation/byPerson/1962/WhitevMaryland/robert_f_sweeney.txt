mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
mr.
chief
justice
–-
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
--
members
of
the
court.
let
me
say
at
the
outset
that
the
state
of
maryland
is
fully
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
the
rights
of
its
most
depraved
citizen
must
be
just
as
zealously
guarded
as
those
of
the
most
honored
member
of
our
society.
it
is
because
of
this
feeling
that
the
institution
known
as
the
preliminary
hearing
exists
in
the
state
of
maryland
and
the
primary
purpose
of
the
preliminary
hearing
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
accused,
as
noted
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
who
are
perhaps
best
qualified
to
comment
on
the
functions
of
that
particular
institution
and
it
might
clarify
some
of
the
questions
raised
here
today.
to
quote
briefly
from
a
recent
case
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
which
they
discussed
the
preliminary
hearing
at
page
6
of
our
brief,
the
case
of
williams
versus
the
state
in
which
the
court
said
that
this
hearing
before
the
magistrate
is
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
there
was
probable
ground
to
believe
the
accused
guilty.
the
magistrate
therefore
can
only
commit
the
accused
who
are
the
--
for
the
--
for
an
appearance
before
the
grand
jury,
subject
to
bail
under
certain
circumstances
or
discharge
him.
the
hearing
is
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
accused
ensuring
him
against
being
committed
for
action
by
the
grand
jury
on
charges
which
are
groundless
and
this
next
quotation
i
believe
is
of
particular
interest,
“there
is
no
reason,
the
court
said,
why
the
accused
should
be
required
to
enter
a
plea
at
that
time,
where
however,
such
a
plea
is
voluntarily
made
by
the
accused,
evidence
of
the
plea
is
generally
held
to
be
admissible
in
the
trial
on
the
indictment.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
--
that
there
was
no
coercion
other
than
the
question
itself.
the
question
was
put
to
him.
voluntary
in
the
sense
that
had
he
refused
to
enter
to
plea
no
further
action
would
have
been
taken
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
your
honor
but
the
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
well
your
honor
in
the
question
of
counsel
at
preliminary
hearing,
it
is
our
position
as
the
court
--
the
maryland
court
held
in
this
case
and
in
other
cases
as
the
federal
court,
the
lower
federal
courts
have
held
that
a
plea
entered
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
be
it
either
before
the
magistrate
in
baltimore
city
or
before
a
commissioner
in
the
federal
system
is
in
the
nature
of
an
extra
judicial
confession
and
is
therefore
admissible
at
trial.
now
if
a
man
is
entitled
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
well
they
certainly
might
be
helpful
to
him,
but
so
would
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
in
the
same
sense
that
if
he
had
counsel
with
him
in
an
interrogation-room,
few
confessions
if
any
whatever.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
your
honor
counsel
could
have.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
if
the
cross
examination
brought
out
the
fact
that
there
was
no
basis
for
holding
this
man,
the
man
would
have
been
released.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
you
honor
assuming
that
the
purpose
of
this
hearing
is
only
to
test
the
legality
of
the
arrest
of
the
detention
at
that
point,
we
say
that
it
has
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
the
later
trial
aside
from
the
question
of
the
introduction
of
plea
into
the
evidence.
other
than
that
it
has
no
--what
happens
at
the
preliminary
hearing
has
no
significance
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
trial
or
due
process
accorded
at
the
trial.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
traditionally
i
think
it's
little,
as
few
as
possible.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
now
this
is
true
theoretically
justice
harlan.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
well
the.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
this
was
19th,
i
believe
that
it
was,
yes
it
was
because,
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
they
do
in
their
brief,
yes,
in
their
opinion.
the
maryland
court
does
refer
to
the
case
and
it
distinguishes
there
between
the
arraignment
in
alabama
and
the
arraignment
in
the
state
of
maryland
which
as
the
court
now
understands
i
believe
is
different,
the
arraignment
in
maryland
and
the
preliminary
hearing
in
maryland
are
two
entirely
different
steps.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
the
record
does
not
disclose
that
they
were,
but
i
am
certain
that
they
were
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no
your
honor.
i
have
been
a
magistrate
and
the
procedure
in
the
magistrate's
courts
in
baltimore
city,
i
might
point
out
that
we
no
longer
have
a
magistrate
system
in
baltimore
city,
although
it
exist
else
where
in
the
state,
but
at
this
time
the
time
this
man
was
tried
the
magistrate
served
in
much
the
same
function
as
does
the
commissioner
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
he
was
a
justice
of
the
peace,
but
he
was
not
required
to
be
an
attorney
although
in
baltimore
city
from
18
magistrates
17
were
attorneys.
he
was
not
a
full
time
judicial
officer
and
he
could
in
fact
practice
as
an
attorney
before
other
courts
in
the
state
accepting
only
the
magistrates
in
the
city
or
county
for
which
he
was
appointed.
he
did
not
have
and
this
is
something
that
the
court
must
consider,
he
did
not
have
sufficient
authority
to
appoint
counsel.
he
had
no
jurisdiction
over
members
of
the
bar
to
call
counsel
to
be
appointed
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
nor
did
he
have
funds
available
to
him
to
compensate
such
counsel
as
he
might
volunteer
in
the
event
that
this
should
be
done.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
this
would
nut
but
it
is
a
practical
problem
that
i
think
that
perhaps
the
state
of
maryland
might
be
faced
with
a
problem
that
our
court
deals
with
in
its
opinion.
under
our
new
system
i
might
add
where
we
have
full
time
judges
sitting
as
municipal
court
of
baltimore
city
who
are
required
to
be
attorneys
of
at
least
five
years
of
practice
and
who
are
judges
in
every
sense
of
the
word.
we
still
do
not
have
either
the
authority
on
the
part
of
those
judges
nor
the
funds
available
to
appoint
counsel,
a
question
that
my
brother
and
i
are
dealing
with
all
the
state
judges
next
monday
night
in
an
attempt
to
bring
about
some
compliance
with
the
court's
recent
decision
in
the
gideon
case.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
he
does,
he
has
a
power
to
set
bail.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
between
preliminary
hearing
and
arraignment?
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
but
the
question
in
hamilton
versus
alabama
was
not
with
preliminary
hearing
as
i
understand
the
preliminary
hearing
was
with
an
arraignment
at
which
time
in
hamilton
versus
alabama
as
the
court
pointed
out
certain
pleas
must
either
be
made
or
irrevocably
waived.
there
is
no
such
set
of
circumstances
in
maryland
not
only
at
our
preliminary
hearing,
but
also
no
such
circumstances
at
our
arraignment
because
our
rules
and
our
law
do
not
require,
although
they
require
that
a
plea
be
made
at
arraignment
they
do
not
require
that
it
can
only
be
made
then
nor
do
they
say
that
if
made
at
arraignment
it
cannot
subsequently
be
changed
and
it
can
in
fact
be
changed
and
there
is
no
better
example
than
the
case
at
hand
where
at
his
original
arraignment
not
preliminary
hearing
but
arraignment.
mr.
white
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty,
counsel
was
that
day
or
the
next
day
appointed
for
him.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
he
had
already
pleaded
guilty
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
would
assume
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
well
a
defendant
at
a
preliminary
hearing
cannot
testify,
he
is
not
permitted
to
testify.
he
is
permitted
to
cross
examine
his
witnesses
but
it
is
not
a
trial
and
because
it
is
not
a
trial
no
defense
is
put
on
other
than
such
as.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
they
asked
him
if
he
was
guilty.
now
as
our
court
say
there
is
not
requirement
that
he
be
so
asked,
but
i
would
be
less
than
candid
if
i
said
that
it
was
not
the
customary
procedure
or
at
least
the
more
prevalent
practice
to
ask
a
man
as
to
how
he
pleads
at
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
your
honor
and
so
as
the
time
during
which
interrogation
is
being
held.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
well
in
my
view
if
i
may
say
so
for
this
court
to
say
that
under
hamilton
versus
alabama
we
are
required
to
appoint
counsel
on
these
circumstances,
you
are
stretching
the
hamilton
doctrine
beyond
the
trial
itself,
beyond
the
period
between
arrest
and
trial
and
all
the
way
back
until
the
–
within
hours
of
the
arrest
being
made.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
it's
carrying
it
further
because
you
are
establishing
thereby
the
preliminary
hearing
as
a
part
of
the
trial
procedure.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
then
in
so
saying,
your
honor,
you
are
disagreeing
with
the
opinion
of
my
court
that
the
primary
purpose
of
this
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
accused.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
well,
this
is
not
an
answer,
but
the
practice
that
we
follow
is
the
practice
to
my
knowledge,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
is
now
followed
in
the
federal
system
before
the
commissioners.
and
the
--
where
even
at
the
present
time,
it
is
my
understanding
since
the
gideon
case
that
counsel
will
not
be
appointed
in
the
federal
system
before
a
commissioner,
that
perhaps
raising
their
hopes
on
the
note
in
mr.
justice
harlan's
concurring
opinion
wherein
the
court
perhaps
exempted
petty
offenders
from
those
--
for
whom
counsel
must
be
appointed.
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
in
the
federal
system,
counsel
will
not
be
appointed
in
petty
offenses
under
federal
law
if
he
is
tried
before
a
commissioner,
that
the
commissioner
will
not
have
a
right
in
those
cases
where
he
is
conducting
a
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no,
your
honor.
but
my
point
is
that
the
federal
commissioners
do
not
now
have
the
right
to
appoint
counsel,
and
do
not
as
a
fact
appoint
counsel
neither
before
nor
after
gideon
and
that
this
is
exactly
comparable
to
the
practice
in
maryland.
so
although
as
i
say
this
is
not
an
answer,
if
the
practice
that
we
are
following
in
the
state
of
maryland
is
a
denial
of
due
process,
that's
such
--
that
due
process
is
equally
being
denied
in
the
federal
system.
and
that
in
relying
as
we
do
on
the
prior
decisions
of
the
lower
federal
courts,
perhaps
then
if
the
court
is
going
to
hold
that
this
is
a
denial
of
due
process,
it's
going
to
be
done
not
under
hamilton
or
under
powell,
but
it's
going
to
be
a
new
mandate
of
the
court.
but
my
sole
is
that
we
have
followed
what
we
believe
are
the
opinions
of
the
federal
courts.
we
have
followed
what
we
believe
are
the
practices
of
the
federal
courts.
if
this
is
error
and
i
do
not
submit
nor
believe
that
it
is,
if
it
is
error,
we
will
comply
with
whatever
directions
the
court
gives
in
this
instance.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes,
sir.
first
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
don't
know
how
prevalent
it
is
but
it
certainly
exists
in
the
federal
system,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
had
a
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
of
united
states
versus
adelman,
where
exactly
the
same
set
of
circumstances
as
exists
here
happened
in
the
federal
system.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
in
the
adelman
case,
adelman
had
pleaded
guilty
before
the
commissioner
without
counsel.
he
subsequently
changed
his
plea
and
his
original
plea
was
admitted
in
the
evidence
against
him.
now
to
be
candid
with
the
court,
it's
holding
exactly
to
the
contrary,
is
a
case
on
the
district
court
of
appeals
heavily
relied
on
by
my
brother,
a
case
of
woods
where
under
a
similar
set
of
facts
the
district
court
of
appeals
came
to
almost
an
exact
opposite
conclusion.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no
the
district
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
your
honor.
that's
in
the
case
of
woods
vs.
united
states
which
the
man
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
he
went
to
trial
that
plea
was
entered
against
him
and
the
district
–
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
held
that
it
was
improper
to
do
so.
they
cite
little
authority
for
that
proposition
except
i
think
the
kurchable
which
is
easily
distinguishable
at
least
in
my
opinion
from
this
case
because
in
the
kurchable
case
we
were
concerned
not
--
this
court
was
concerned
not
with
a
plea
made
at
preliminary
hearing
but
a
plea
made
a
trial
and
subsequently
change
with
permission
of
a
trial
court
and
then
attempted
to
be
or
then
used
in
evidence
against
him
and
this
court
said
in
kurchable
that
when
the
court
permitted
the
man
to
change
his
plea
it
was
an
admission
that
his
first
plea
had
been
erroneously
entered
and
therefore
it
was
unfair
and
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no,
no
mr.
justice
albert
because
first
of
all
the
essential
difference
is
that
no
permission
of
any
court
is
needed
to
change
the
play
in
maryland
from
the
preliminary
hearing
white
pleaded
guilty
at
preliminary
hearing
he
pleaded
not
guilty
at
arraignment
without
having
needing
or
getting
or
tempting
to
get
the
sanction
of
permission
from
any
court,
he
subsequently
change
that
plea
again
from
a
simple
plea
of
not
guilty
at
his
first
arraignment
to
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
at
his
second
arraignment.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
but
again,
refolding
again
on
the
terms
at
his
preliminary
hearing
he
was
asked
how
do
you
plea,
he
replied
guilty.
the
magistrate
said
i
am
going
to
enter
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
alright
now
moving
on
to
the
first
arraignment
as
suppose
to
preliminary
hearing,
white
then
pleaded
not
guilty,
he
then
had
a
second
arraignment
at
which
he
pleaded
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
region
of
insanity.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
had
an
idea
that
the
question
might
be
asked.
i
cannot
say
that
whether
i
approve
of
this
being
done
of
course
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
case,
but
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
would
like
to
quote
it
for
the
court.
in
the
new
york
case
before
this
court
where
mr.
justice
harlan
and
running
the
majority
of
opinion
started
out
by
saying
we
share
the
distaste
of
the
lower
court
as
to
the
–
saying
of
circumstances
here.
but
however
distaste
what
we
find
them
out
question
is
our
problem
is
to
find
hasn't
been
a
constitutional
denial
of
due
process.
perhaps
this
might
apply
to
the
present
case
however
unfortunate
this
set
of
circumstances
might
be
we
say
that
it
does
not
amend
to
an
unconstitutional
denial
of
new
process.
we
say
that
this
is
not
a
part
of
the
trial
that
it
does
not
–
hamilton
vs.
alabama
cannot
apply
here
because
or
it
has
–
it
must
be
stretched
to
make
it
apply
and
that
in
if
the
court
chooses
to
so
stretch
the
case
of
hamilton
vs.
alabama
it
will
greatly
hamper
the
activities
of
law
enforcement
officials,
it
will
take
it
back
to
within
hours
of
the
arrest
itself
at
least
in
maryland
and
that
it
will
make
it
much
more
difficult
to
do
interrogation,
solve
crimes
which
plague
the
community.
i
might
also
point
out
that
despite
the
language
in
hamilton
versus
alabama
that
says
where
a
man
is
permitted
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
without
counsel,
in
a
capital
case
we
do
not
stop
to
enquire
as
to
what
the
prejudice
exists.
now
this
is
a
very
serious
language
when
applied
to
circumstances
such
as
these.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
now,
as
to
that
mr.
justice
white,
i
can
say
that
the
practice
in
many
states
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
now
the
practice--
the
prevalent
practice
in
many
states
where
the
prevalent
practice
is
that
such
evidence
is
admissible,
again
i
refer
it
back
to
the
lower--
to
the
federal
criminal
system
where
such
a
practice
will
be
is
--
where
such
a
plea
is
admissible
at
the
trial
at
least
under
the
adelman
case,
if
not
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
if
that
is
your
opinion,
then
i
got
it
so.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
because
in
the
opinion
of
this
one
particular
minor
judicial
official,
the
man
should
not
be
permitted
to
plead
or
should
not
be
required
or
allowed
to
plead
in
the
absence
of
counsel.
however,
i
much
i
might
agree
with
him,
this
is
not
the
opinion
--
this
is
not
the
law
in
the
state
of
maryland.
it
is
not
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
which
is
with
the
exception
of
this
court
the
final
question
in
this
in
the
lead
in
our
state
as
to
what
is
constitutional
and
what
is
not?
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
it
means
nothing,
it
means
nothing.
it's
only
as
–
as
one
of
the
justices
has
put
the
finger
on
it
and
magistrate
will
sit,
i
heard
i
think
in
one
year
some
6000
cases
as
a
magistrate.
and
as
a
matter
of
form
in
every
case
where
you
have
jurisdiction,
you
ask
where
you
are
actually
going
to
conduct
the
trial,
you
ask
the
defendant
if
he
wants
to
be
tried
before
you
as
a
magistrate
or
if
he
likes
to
jury
trial
which
in
they
have?
this
practice
of
asking
the
questions
is
for
some
of
the
reason
unknown
to
me
carried
over
to
preliminary
hearing
where
obviously
the
magistrate
has
no
authority
to
conduct
a
hearing.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
that
is
--
that
is
actually
at
the
trial
itself.
as
the
trial
commences
the
man
elects
either
a
jury
trial
or
court
trial
at
arraignment
but
as
the
trial
itself
commences
the
prac
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
at
arraignment,
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
but
if
--
but
he
can
subsequently
at
the
trial
itself,
elect
a
jury
trail
even
if
at
arraignment
he
had
prayed
a
court
trial.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
for
some
real
papers
have
been
written
and
books
perhaps
could
be
written
about
the
few
cases
in
maryland,
criminal
cases
of
any
kind
wherein
a
jury
prayed
i
think
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
it
is,
i
think
that
jury
has
perhaps
has
prayed
in
less
than
one
case
out
of
ten.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
in
many
case,
in
many
instances
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
it
maybe
three
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no,
customarily
no.
it
can
be
--
it
can
be
made
if
the
defendant
wishes
to
have
such
a
plea
made
--
such
a
transcript
made
but
the
state
makes
no
provision
for
a
transcript.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
oh
no,
we
do
not.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
it's
admissible
because
the
man
at
this
time,
at
this
date
and
in
this
place,
where
the
preliminary
hearing
was
held,
in
response
to
the
question
of
are
you
guilty
or
not
said
i
am
guilty,
regardless
of
what
the
docket
entry
shows.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
then
it
would
have
some
bearing
as
to
the
voluntary
nature
of
it,
but
the
fact
would
still
stand
that
the
man
did
say
that
he
was
guilty,
in
his
own
mind
he
was
guilty,
so
evidence
of
a
conscious,
a
guilty
conscious
mind.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
our
understanding
is
that
he
cannot
mount
any
defense
of
any
kind
at
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
it
--
i
am
glad
that
you
asked
the
question
because
the
confessions
on
the
question
of
prejudice
and
the
court
not
stopping
to
see
if
prejudice
exists,
here
the
confessions
which
our
court
after
exhaustive
testimony
found
to
be
voluntary
were
given
completely
prior
to
the
first
of
these
preliminary
hearings
and
these
confessions
that
were
admitted
into
the
evidence
at
the
trial.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
except
at
trial.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
as
to
waiver?
we
believe
that
they
by
not
objecting
that
this
man
was
represented
at
his
trial
by
three
competent,
experienced
trial
counsel
for
the
baltimore
bar
and
that
even
under
the
noia
case
of
reason
weeks,
that
there
still
exists
at
law
a
knowing,
conscious,
intelligent
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
well
we
believe
that
he
did.
there
was
a
knowing,
conscious,
intelligent
waiver
and
that
having
waved
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
they
might
very
well
have
waived
is
that
one
of
their
pleas
was
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
having
which
--
having
been
waived
below.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
yes
and
it
is
our
feeling
that
this
is,
as
we
cite
in
our
brief,
that
this
is
determined
by
the
question
here.
that
not
having
objected
at
the
time,
that
he
is
without
standing
later
to
no
object.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
mrs.
mapp
objected,
if
i
may
go
back
to
mapp
versus
ohio,
her
attorney
must
have
known
that
the
state
court
would
deny
his
objection,
but
he
objected
and
he
persisted
in
his
objections
to
this
court
where
he
smuggled
the
question
in
so
i
recall
the
language
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
i
thought
that
you
would,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
oh,
clayton,
yes,
yes.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
may
i
just
direct
my
remarks
first
to
mr.
justice
white.
i'm
sorry
i
was
so
dense
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
i
don't
think
and
i
am
not
calling
mr.
sweeney
dense
he
didn't
understand
it
either.
you
are
reading
the
language
here
saying
the
accused
when
brought
before
me
and
on
being
informed
by
me
of
his
right
to
a
trail
by
jury,
actually
how
this
is
used
so
let
us
assume
we
have
an
assault
case
before
a
magistrate
and
the
magistrate
has
the
right
try
this
case,
he
has
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
criminal
court.
if
the
lawyer
doesn't
like
this
magistrate
and
he
doesn't
want
to
try
the
case
in
front
of
him,
he
asks
for
a
jury
trial
and
at
that
time
the
magistrate
cannot
try
the
case,
he
must
send
it
uptown
the
criminal
court
and
that
is
what
the
practical
purpose
of
that
rule
is
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
no
sir,
no.
not
does
he
have
to
take
the
jury
trial
when
it
goes
uptown.
it
is
actually
used
to
say
i
don't
want
to
try
this
case
in
front
of
you
mr.
magistrate
and
that's
--
and
so
just
send
it
uptown
and
that's
--
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
it
seemed
that
way
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
also
sir
if
you
have
your
attorney
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
if
you
have
an
attorney
you
would
ask
for
a
transcript
and
the
state
in
most
homicide
cases
does
take
down
the
testimony
of
prosecuting
witnesses
inn
these
hearings.
now
justice
goldberg,
just
a
remark
to
you
sir,
a
beautiful
decision
was
written
by
justice
rutledge
in
the
woods
case
where
he
discusses
the
adelman
case
case
and
every
other
case
and
why
he
discounts
the
thinking
in
the
adelman
case
and
completely
reviews
the
idea
of
allowing
a
guilty
plea
by
an
unrepresented
man
could
be
allowed
into
evidence
and
this
thinking
has
been
followed
in
quite
a
number
of
jurisdictions
and
my
last
point
is
i
would
like
to
say
to
this
court
i
don't
consider
this
a,
if
you
rule,
overrule
our
court
of
appeals,
a
stretching
of
the
hamilton
case.
the
hamilton
case
is
just
an
extension
in
my
opinion
of
the
powell
case,
the
keywords
to
me
are
what
happens
there
may
have
the
affect
the
whole
trial.
our
court
of
appeals
went
upon
the
words
arraignment
and
they
didn't
have
to?
what
this
court
as
far
as
i'm
concerned
stated
in
the
hamilton
case
was
at
any
time,
reiterating
powell,
anytime
where
prejudice,
where
something
will
happen
to
a
to
an
unrepresented
indigent
or
any
defendant.
anytime
in
any
proceeding,
he
would
be
affected,
he
must
then
have
counsel.
i
think
this
courts
says
no
more,
no
less.
mr.
robert
f.
sweeney
thank
you
very
much.
