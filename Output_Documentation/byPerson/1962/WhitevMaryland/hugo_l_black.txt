justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
your
magistrate
is
required
to
write
down
notes
of
the
witnesses
he
examined?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
was
he,
was
he
a
justice
of
the
peace?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
of
course
wouldn't
affect
your
constitutional
point,
would
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
your
magistrate
have
power
to
grant
bail?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
way
you
described
it,
i
see
very
little
--
i
don't
know
about
the
names
given
to
them,
but
i
have
tried
a
great
many
preliminary
trials
in
alabama
both
a
s
a
magistrate
and
as
a
lawyer
and
i
can't
see
any
difference
in
the
two.
justice
hugo
l.
black
preliminary
hearing
and
a
preliminary
hearing
in
alabama?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
he
had
already
pleaded
guilty
on
an
arraignment?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
assume
it's
proved
that,
everybody
that
is
able
to
get
a
lawyer
for
an
arraignment
gets
it,
doesn't
he?
i
thought
preliminary
â€“
if
he
is
charged
with
murder
or
something
like
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
very
wise
to
do
it,
it's
very
wise
if
possible
to
get
the
evidence
written
down,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it's
very
wise
for
him
to
be
able
to
tell
his
client
whether
to
take
his
stand
and
say
anything
or
not,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
they
asked
him
if
he
was
guilty.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
would
recognize
i
am
sure
that
in
the
language
of
powell
that
every
stage
of
proceeding
which
is
important
to
the
defendant
that
this
step
has
to
be
there.
it's
exceedingly
great
to
the
defendant
in
great
many
instances
where
they
charge
the
fellow,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
correct
this
is
before
a
magistrate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
as
justice
brennan
said
the
other
can
be
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
being
stretched
to
the
point,
the
first
point
was
defendant
is
brought
before
a
judge
or
a
magistrate
who
is
certainly
a
judicial
officer
not
a
lawyer
and
he
is
called
on
to
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty
is
carrying
it
that
far
[inaudible]
any
further
at
a
place
which
is
important
to
him
as
a
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
as
part
of
--
actual
part
of
it,
but
as
the
part
of
proceedings
if
the
state
takes
to
get
him
convicted.
eventually,
hold
him,
get
him
to
hold
him,
decide
whether
to
hold
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
it
might
be.
i
understand
that
from
one
standpoint
the
whole
history
of
it
is
that
there
was
solicitude;
you
see
that
people
were
not
grudged
often,
put
them
in
jail
and
shut
up
there
without
any
chance
[inaudible]
might
not
leave
for
six
months
say
they
got
to
have
a
hearing
and
they
got
to
have
a
chance,
but
that
does
not
take
away
from
it
the
other
important
part,
does
it?
it's
an
extremely
great
moment
to
the
defender
that
he
be
advised
properly
on
how
to
proceed
in
connection
with
the
serious
charges
against
him.
you
don't
have
to
disagree
with
your
court
on
that
other
point,
i
don't
think.
i
agree
with
them.
i
think
that's
your
basic
foundation
for
the
preliminary
trial.
see
if
he
didn't
get
bail,
see
whether
he
could
be
held
over;
see
the
terms
under
which
he
should
be
held
over.
does
that
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
that's
a
time
at
every
stage
it
was
the
time
from
the
time
he
is
arrested
until
he
is
convicted
finally
that
he
has
to
be
protected
if
a
state
gets
him
in
a
position
where
it's
calling
on
him
to
the
answer
to
his
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
was
not
a
petty
offense?
