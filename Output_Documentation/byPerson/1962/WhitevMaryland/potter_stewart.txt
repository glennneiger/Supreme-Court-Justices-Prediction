might
to
create
i
suppose
as
power
to
try
on
–-
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
any
witnesses
at
this
preliminary
hearing
of
this
man?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
our
court
has
held
regarding
preliminary
hearings,
(a)
that
they
may
be
waved
by
the
defendant
and
(b)
that
the
theory
around
the
part
of
the
state
to
hold
a
preliminary
hearing
or
postponing
it
does
not
vitiate
a
later
conviction
because
our
court
recognizes
that
this
is
a
separate
proceeding
and
not
a
part
of
a
trial
and
this
is
the
crux
of
our
argument
that
whatever
the
circumstances
here
at
the
trial,
whatever
the
unfortunate
circumstances
regarding
accepting
the
plea
of
guilty,
noting
a
plea
of
not
guilty
and
then
subsequently
entering
in
to
evidence
at
the
trial
the
oral
plea
of
guilty,
that
forgetting
all
of
this
that
the
question
before
the
court
is
this
a
denial
a
due
process
under
the
case
of
hamilton
versus
alabama
and
we
say
that
it
is
not,
your
honors.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
weisgal,
to
me
at
least
there
are
two
separate
questions
which
you
have
seem
to
consider
as
one.
one
is
whether
or
not
this
the
constitutional
requirement
this
man
to
be
–
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
his
preliminary
hearing,
that's
one
question.
the
second
question
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
maryland
to
exclude
his
plea
of
guilty
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
are
those
two
separate
questions?
justice
potter
stewart
but
what
if
he
had?
well
that's
your
argument
but
what
if
he
had
had
counsel
and
he
pleaded
guilty
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
justice
potter
stewart
right
from
the
beginning
his
counsel
is
going
to
plead
in
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
and
so
then
--
so
you
--
this
defense
starts
right
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
[inaudible]
this
is
the
beginning
of
his
evidence
that
the
man
is
insane.
justice
potter
stewart
did
we
limit
the
grant
of
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
did
we
limit
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
right
to
counsel
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
would
you
be
arguing
to
us?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
you
have
relied
very
heavily
on
the
subsequent
years
of
the
guilty
plea
in
that
–-
