mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
affirming
petitioner's
conviction
for
murder
by
the
criminal
court
of
baltimore
city
theft,
death
penalty
was
imposed.
a
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court
and
it
was
limited
to
the
point
raised
in
hamilton
versus
alabama.
the
pertinent
undisputed
facts
briefly
are
that
on
may
27,
1960
the
petitioner
was
arrested
and
taken
to
the
central
police
station
in
baltimore
city.
this
is
approximately
12:40
pm
and
at
approximately
6:30
that
evening
he
was
booked,
which
means
the
charges
were
placed
against
him
on
the
docket.
he
was
brought
before
a
magistrate
on
may
31,
four
days
later,
3
pm
and
the
state,
which
usually
appears
at
all
of
these
preliminary
hearings,
representing
this
day
asked
for
a
postponement
at
that
time.
postponement
was
granted
and
the
man
was
remanded
to
at
that
to
the
baltimore
city
jail
where
he
remained
until
august
9
when
he
was
again
brought
before
the
magistrate
for
a
preliminary
hearing.
at
this
preliminary
hearing,
as
is
the
practice
in
maryland,
even
though
the
magistrate
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
try
this
case,
he
is
asked
if
he
wants
to
plea
guilty
or
not
guilty
and
the
man
entered
the
plea
of
guilty.
now
come,
of
course,
to
the
important
point
that
is
before
this
court.
this
man
did
not
have
an
attorney
representing
him
either
at
may
27
or
at
any
time
up
until
this
hearing
of
august
19,
still
did
not
have
an
attorney
rather
and
the
magistrate
after
the
preliminary
hearing
just
referred
to
case
sent
it
up
ham
as
we
say
in
baltimore,
to
the
grand
jury.
an
indictment
was
brought
out,
and
on
september
9
be
was
brought
to
the
criminal
court,
or
september
8,
he
was
brought
to
criminal
court
for
arraignment.
he
still
did
not
have
an
attorney
and
at
that
time
a
plea
of
not
guilty
was
entered
by
him
by
the
court.
the
court
then
appointed
an
attorney.
he
was
re-arraigned
on
november
25,
1960,
at
which
time
through
his
counsel,
he
entered
pleas
of
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
the
case
came
to
trial
on
february
28,
1961.
it
was
practically
a
year
later,
and
during
the
course
of
the
trial
the
following
testimony
took
place
on
page
5
of
our
brief
where
the
state
asked
the
lieutenant,
the
arresting
officer,
lieutenant
glover,
were
you
present
at
the
preliminary
homicide
hearing
before
magistrate
claudney
on
august
8,
1960
where
white
was
charged
with
the
--
this
offence.
i
was.
sir,
do
you
recall
what
plea,
if
any,
that
defended
white
gave
upon
his
arraignment
at
that
time?
white
gave
a
plea
of
guilty.
let
me
clarify
one
thing
to
this
court
at
this
time.
the
use
of
the
arraignment
by
the
state
attorney
at
that
time
means
--
it
does
not
mean
that
there
was
an
arraignment
as
such.
this
was
a
preliminary
hearing.
he
uses
the
word
arraignment
to
mean
that
he
appeared
before
magistrate
and
nothing
else.
now
this
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
during
the
course
of
the
trial
at
criminal
court,
no
sir,
but
i
think
that
is
answered
quite
clearly
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
any
objection
even
if
it
had
been
made
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference,
because
the
maryland
has
recognized
the
rule
that
if
you
plead
guilty
before
a
magistrate
they
can
introduce
this
plea
in
evidence
against
you.
they
can
use
this.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes,
i
am
insisting
that
but
you
held
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
no,
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
well,
actually
he
had
everything
that
happen
to
him
happened
before
it
took
place
at
his
appearance
before
the
magistrate.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
well
actually,
that
was
waived
by
his
attorney.
the
question
of
the
jury
trial
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
one
or
the
other,
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
no,
i
am
not
trying
to
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
i
am
sorry,
sir.
i
am
saying
that
the
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
no,
sir.
this
is
not
a
jury
trial.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
when
was
it
first
waived,
at
his
arraignment;
at
his
re-arraignment
on
november
25th.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
when
he
was
represented
by
counsel.
counsel
at
that
time
entered
the
plea
of
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
the
preliminary
hearing
was,
one
was
on
may
31
and
then
the
–
at
which
time
it
postponed
who
was
asked
for
by
the
state.
then
the
actual
preliminary
hearing
in
question
in
this
case,
the
one
that
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
ruled
on
was
on
august
9.
now
through
out
this
entire
period
he
was
not
represented
by
counsel.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
august
the
9.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
november
the
--
the
arraignment,
the
meaningful
arraignment,
it
was
november
25,
1960,
but
let
me
make
this
point
clear.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct
sir.
that's
the
typical
form
in
now.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
no
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
because,
you
are
talking
about
a
waiver
for
a
jury
trial?
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
because
the
preliminary
hearing
is
just
to
determine
in
maryland
whether
or
not
the
state
can
make
out
a
prime
facie
case
against
the
–-
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
there
is
--
the
question
of
waiver
of
a
jury
trail
was
never
discussed
in
any
of
these
cases
sir
or
any
of
the
arguments.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct.
because
that
makes
that
you
can't
waive
a
trial
by
jury
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
a
preliminary
hearing
in
maryland
is
simply
to
determine
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
whether
or
not
this
--
in
a
capital
case.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir,
this
is
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
certain,
certain
types
of
cases
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
he
has
jurisdiction.
justice
brennan
this
was
put
in
here
to
believe
or
not
to
try
to
make
things
simpler
for
this
court
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion.
this
was
not
before
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
any
of
this
record.
we
put
this
in
here,
mr.
sweeny
and
i
with
the
hope
this
show
you
the
procedure
in
maryland
and
i
think
we
succeeded
in
not
showing
what
the
procedure
is?
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
exactly
–-
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
not
where
a
capital
offence
or
where
a
burglary
offence
or
any
other
things
over
which
a
magistrate
does
not
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
oh!
please,
in
fact
do
me
a
favor
and
ignore
this
because
this
is
not
the
issue
before
this
court.
the
issue
that
is
before
this
court
is
that
this
man
that
a
lieutenant
who
happens
to
be
at
this
hearing
testifies
and
testifies
truthfully
that
this
man
when
brought
before
the
magistrate
when
asked
for
a
plea,
simply
says
i
plead
guilty
and
then
he
changed,
when
he
is
appointed
an
attorney
by
the
state
at
his
criminal
hearing
on
the
trial
on
the
indictment
and
pleads
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
a
reason
of
insanity,
the
state
introduces
this
plea
into
evidence.
now
–-
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
well
actually
i
have
never
believed
in
meaningless
objection.
the
court
of
appeals
has
ruled,
time
and
time
again,
that
these
pleas
are
admissible,
but
the
court
of
appeals
goes
on
to
say
if
i'm
not
mistaken
justice
harlan
that
even
if
he
had
objected
that
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
to
them
because
the
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
right.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
now
i
say
this
that
they
have
the
right
under
their
rules.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
has
the
right
under
their
rules
in
certain
instances
where
prejudice
is
shown,
where
a
wrong
is
committed
and
the
attorney
let's
say
does
not
object,
they
then
have
the
absolute
right
to
consider
the
question.
they
just
say
well
we
are
not
going
to
consider
--that's
not
the
case
–
that
they
won't
they
don't
have
to
consider
the
question,
the
opinion
[inaudible]
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
thank
you.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
judge
harlan,
may
i
return
to
your
question
with
respect
to
waver?
the
point
that
we
are
raising
here
is
that
had
this
man
had
counsel
at
his
preliminary
hearing
this
question
--
you
would
never
have
been
able
to
ask
this
question.
i
think,
this
is
the
crux
of
the
entire
matter,
the
fact
that
at
a
preliminary
hearing
this
man
was
allowed
to
plea
to
a
capital
case
without
benefit
of
counsel.
now,
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
waived
it.
they
just
simply
state
that
it
wasn't
properly
before
them
and
was
not
raised
below
or
decided
by
the
trial
court,
but
they
do
go
on
to
point
out,
without
further
content
--
discussion
that
the
contention
is
without
merit.
certainly,
this
doesn't
preclude
this
court
from
considering
the
fact
that
prejudice
that
resulted
from
not
being
represented
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
the
rule
is
quite
clear
sir.
at
arraignment,
in
a
capital
case
or
other
serious
charges
our
rules
provide
that
a
man
--
the
court
should
provide
a
counsel
for
him.
now
i
might
say
this
that
in
all
fairness
to
our
courts,
at
least,
in
baltimore
city,
the
practice
is
now
been
for
the
last
couple
of
years,
at
least,
to
provide
counsel
in
almost
every
type
of
case
where
an
indigent
appears
before
them
without
counsel,
but
this
raises
the
big
problem.
by
the
time
they
get
their
in
certain
cases
--
by
the
time
you
get
to
the
criminal
court
in
baltimore
city
any
type
of
counsel
that
received
at
that
time
will
do
no
good
because
you
had
lost
so
many
rights.
let's
just
look
at
the
facts
in
this
case
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
well
the
statue
–-
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
at
arraignment,
the
man,
if
he
does
not
have
an
attorney
must
be
provided
counsel
by
the
state
in
capital
other
serious
charges
that
is
the
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
all.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
no,
sir.
judge
in
a
criminal
court
in
a
capital
case
will
not
ask
a
man
how
he
pleads
if
he
doesn't
have
counsel.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
i'd
venture
to
say
sir,
that
that
plea
was
entered
by
the
judge
that
he
did
not
accept
the
plea
and
that
it
shows
on
the
record
that
on
september
9
counsel
was
appointed
for
him
and
he
was
re-arraigned
at
which
time
pleas
were
entered
of
not
guilty
and
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
oh!
you
mean
the
magistrate?
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
oh!
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yeah.
i
am
sorry,
i
was
confusing
your
use
of
the
arraignment
with
preliminary
hearing.
in
maryland
we
have
a
preliminary
hearing.
at
the
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
no
sir,
it
was
not.
that's
why
i
said
the
use
of
the
arraignment
by
the
state
attorney
in
this
case
was
absolutely
inappropriate.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
at
a
preliminary
hearing
the
practice
is,
the
man
is
brought
before
the
magistrate.
the
magistrate
must
say
to
you
“do
you
wish
to
have
your
case
tried
before
me,
or
you
wish
to
have
your
tried
up,
or
you
wish
me
to
send
it
to
the
criminal
court
of
baltimore
city?
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
that's
exactly
what
took
place
in
this
case.
the
man
said
i
want
to
try
it
before
you
thinking
that
he
can
be
tried
before
a
magistrate,
the
magistrate
then
says
“how
do
you
plead”
the
man
said
and
it's
true
he
pled
guilty,
but
the
magistrate
knowing
that
he
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
this
case
just
entered
a
plea
of
not
guilty
on
the
docket.
he
did
not
even
enter
this
man's
plea
of
guilty
down
there.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
that's
the
law
in
maryland.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
at
arraignment,
sir,
at
arraignment.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct.
now
a
preliminary
hearing
is
a
magistrate's
hearing,
it's
held
in
the,
and
we've
got
something
like
non-police
stations
involved
in
baltimore
city,
all
homicide
cases
are
tried
at
central
police
station.
the
state
represents
the
state
at
--
the
state
is
represented,
rather
at
these
preliminary
hearings
by
the
state's
attorney.
if
the
man
does
not
have
counsel,
they
just
go
ahead
and
make
out
a
prima-facie
case
if
they
can
before
the
magistrate
and
then
they
continue.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
prime
case,
that's
correct
sir
–-
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
well
i
have
sir
in
my
brief.
i
haven't
been
able
to
get
to
their
point
yet
sir,
but
i'm
saying
that
these
are
the
wrongs
that
we
are
here
complaining
about
is
the
fact
that
this
man
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
if
he
has
an
attorney,
certainly
can
find
out
whether
or
not
state
can
make
out
a
prime
facie
case,
can
then
for
the
first
time
that
defendant
at
a
preliminary
hearing
can
find
out
who
the
state
witnesses
are?
what
the
charges
are
against
him,
can
at
that
point
effectively
begin
to
prepare
his
defense
not
wait
as
in
this
case
five
months
before
he
is
appointed
an
attorney.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
could
not
do
anything
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
exactly
sir.
that's
the
exact
situation
that
prevailed
and
existed
in
melon
and
–-
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct.
well,
this
court
has
in
fact
and
that's
why
i
say
that
our
court
of
appeals
almost
used
reverse,
a
reverse
diligent
and
if
i
may,
in
arriving
at
their
decision
in
this
case.
they
said
that
in
this
case
that
arraignment
in
alabama
is
not
like
arraignment
in
maryland.
that's
true,
it's
not,
but
arraignment
in
alabama
is
somewhat
alike
to
arraignment
to
preliminary
hearing
in
maryland.
so
they
say
since
this
was
an
arraignment
and
the
man
doesn't
loose
any
rights
at
arraignment
therefore
we
do
not
have
to
follow
the
rule
in
the
alabama
case
that
whatever
what
happens
there
may
possibly
affect
the
rest
of
the
trial
so
they
consequently
just
ignored
this
entire
issue.
they
ignored
the
thinking
of
this
court
in
powell
that
we
--
that
this
court
has
stated
time
and
time
again
when
you
plea
to
a
criminal
--
to
a
capital
charge
you
must
have
counsel,
you
must
have
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel,
now
the
attorney
general
comes
along
and
tries
to
re-interpret
the
court
of
appeals
thinking
by
saying
well
a
preliminary
hearing
is
not
really
a
judicial
hearing.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
exactly.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
exactly.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct.
it
is
conceivable
that
this
case
could
be
dismissed
at
the
preliminary
hearing.
it
is
conceivable.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
that's
correct.
i
may
even
point
out
that
this
court
i
think
has
practically
agreed
as
to
these
propositions
in
the
crooker
case
where
you
discussed
the,
the
pre
--
the
importance
of
the
pre-trial
proceedings
and
i
would
just
briefly
mention
these
things
because
i
would
like
to
say
whatever
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
in
the
crooker
case
which
was
decided
prior
before
this
court
stated
that
the
pre-trial
proceedings
are
extremely
important
proceedings
and
you
should
--
and
you
should
have
counsel
at
that
time.
also
i
would
just
recall
to
this
court
the
mr.
beanie's
article
on
the
right
to
counsel,
this
is
not
in
my
brief
i
am
sorry,
put
it
by
minnesota
law
review
771
where
mr.
beanie
and
mr.
orfield,
incidentally
justice
douglas
you
wrote
the
introduction
of
this
article,
state
that
this
--
the
preliminary
hearing,
the
pre-trial
what
we
call
in
maryland,
the
pre-trial
proceedings
are
the
most
critical
in
the
defense
of
an
indigent
or
in
defense
of
any
man
accused
of
a
crime.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
the
rebuttal
if
i
may.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir,
but
we
are
only
--
you
only
limited
in
the
cert
to
this
one
question,
the
right
the
counsel
and
my
argument
is
if
he
had
counsel
he
never
would
have
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
well
it
be
that
had
counsel
pleaded
guilty
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
i
might
be
here
i
don't
know
but
i
might
be
here
on
the
question
of
competency
of
counsel
because
there
is
no
reason
to
enter
a
plea
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
if
he
had
–
if
he
had
the
competent
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing,
the
counsel
will
just
stand
up
there,
the
judge
will
say
do
you
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty,
the
counsel
will
say
well
we
don't
have
to
enter
any
plea,
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
hearing
we
will
enter
--
he
cannot
refuse
or
enter
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
he
would
never
plead
guilty
unless
he
was
completely
incompetent.
and
see
this
is
what's
wrong
with
the
maryland
law,
it
imposes
upon
the
defendant
the
duty
to
know
that
he
doesn't
have
the
answer
to
magistrate.
it
imposes
upon
him
--
that's
why
i
have
to
laugh
when
they
say
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
accused.
historically
a
preliminary
hearing
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
accused,
but
look
what
happened
to
the
accused
in
this
case.
he
is
held
for
four
days
without
a
preliminary
hearing.
then
when
brought
before
the
court
for
the
preliminary
hearing,
they
say
the
state
asks
for
the
extension
of
time
so
they
hold
him
in
the
jail
for
another
two
months,
then
they
have
the
preliminary
hearing,
he
pleads
guilty.
he
is
held
in
jail
for
another
month.
meanwhile
if
he
had
any
witnesses,
if
he
had
any
one
that
could
have
possibly
have
helped
him,
they
could
have
died,
they
could
disappeared,
every
--
all
of
these
ingredients
necessary
to
a
proper
defense
are
just
going
out
the
window
at
this
time.
that's
why
i
am
saying
that
this
is
not
an
excuse
--
this
is
not
stretching
hamilton.
this
is
the
natural,
logical
extension
of
the,
of
the
hamilton
case,
that
we
must
appoint
counsel.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
sir?
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes,
you
limited
i
think
to
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
yes
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
i
would
be
here
under
hamilton,
but
i
would
be
here
to
say,
i
would
be
here
in
the
same
manner.
i
would
not
the
faced
with
the
exact
--
i
would
not
be
faced
with
the
question
of
the
guilty
plea.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
the
same
thing
i
have
been
trying
to
argue
today
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
i
just
said
this
is
one
of
the
most
preponderance
pieces
of
prejudice
that
seem
to
happen
in
a
--
in
a
case,
but
i
would
still
say
that
the
right
to
---
the
fact
that
that
this
man
remained
in
jail
for
five
months
without
the
right
to
speak
to
anyone,
to
have
some
one
to
help
him
in
and
off
itself
is
a
deprivation
of
due
process.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
it
means
jury
didn't
get
this
case
mr.
justice
white
until
some
time
in
september.
this
man
was
arrested
on
may
27.
this
man
would
have
been
better
off
if
he
had
known
to
waive
the
preliminary
hearing,
at
least
then
the
case
would
have
been
sent
to
the
grand
jury,
the
grand
jury
would
have
acted
on
the
case
and
then
may
be
he
would
have
been
brought
to
criminal
court
for
arraignment.
this
shows
the
weakness
of
not
giving
an
indigent
descendent
counsel
at
a
preliminary
hearing
or
providing
an
indigent
with
counsel
at
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
no
sir.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
well,
because
he
would
have
had
an
attorney
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
no.
i
withdraw
that.
i
say
but
at
least
let's
assume
that
i
have
been
appointed.
i
would
have
--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
no,
but
let's
assume
that
it
would,
i
would
have
been--
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
you
get
to
trail
phase
but
–-
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
well,
you
get
up
to
the
grand
jury.
the
lawyer
can
see
to
it
that
the
case
gets
up
there.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
i
will
answer
it
this
way.
at
least
i
would
have
been
preparing
the
case.
i
would
have
been
doing
some
work
for
the
man.
i
would
have
been
trying
to
interview
witnesses.
i
would
like
to
--
i
would
have
known
what
the
state's
case
was
against
this
man.
i
would
have
been
effectively
i
hope
prepare
his
defense.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
he
is
not
waiting
for
the
grand
jury.
he
was
waiting
for
some
one
to
help
him.
they
just
didn't
–
i
am
saying
that
no
man
if
the
–
no
indigent
were
--
i
am
sorry,
no
defendant
would
have
remained
in
jail
for
that
period
of
time
without
at
least
something
done
for
him
if
he
were
represented
by
an
attorney,
it's
inconceivable.
of
course
we
have
this.
this
happens
a
great
deal
in
maryland,
i
am
sorry
to
say.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
exactly
i
just
did
that
sir.
we
would
have
gone
right
uptown
and
it
would
have
–-
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
he
had
much
longer,
he
really
did
and
one
other
thing;
this
man
did
not
plead
not
guilty
at
his
first
arraignment.
the
court
and
i
found
this
out
from
counsel
entered
the
plea
of
not
guilty
until
he
appointed
a
counsel
for
him.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
fred
e.
weisgal
thank
your
honor.
