number
600,
robert
galloway
white,
petitioner,
versus
maryland.
mr.
weisgal.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
you
may
answer
that
after
the
recess.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weisgal
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weisgal,
may
i
ask
just
what
does
your
statue
provide
is
to
be
done
at
this
arraignment,
where
the
defender
was
alone?
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
get
to
the
fact.
so
let's
find
that's
the
statue
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
requires
to
be
done
at
the
arraignment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
all
its
stands?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
--
didn't
the
judge
ask
him
here
how
he
pled?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
says
him,
here
that
he
did
plead
â€“
that
he
did
plead
guilty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
or
did
the
judge
or
did
he
not,
ask
him
of
he
was
guilty
or
not
guilty,
i
mean
the
commissioner?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
magistrate
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
ask
him
or
did
he
not
ask
him
that
he
was
guilty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
isn't
that
called
in
arraignment?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now
what
is
required
at
the
preliminary
hearing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
it
most
in
capital
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
--
may
i
just
pursue
that
one
point
mr.
weisgal.
does
the
law
kind
of
play
that
at
a
preliminary
hearing
in
a
capital
case
the
magistrate
shall
ask
him
how
he
pleads,
guilty
or
not
guilty?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
that's
i
wanted
to
know.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
suppose
you
would
add
to
what
you
have
said
also
the
fact
that
the
judge
asked
him
how
pleaded,
guilty
or
not
guilty,
when
he
was
required
to
answer
that
question
without
the
benefit
of
counsel.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sweeney?
chief
justice
earl
warren
was
this
voluntarily
made
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that
he
was
asked
to
plead,
how
do
you
plead?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
counsel
cross
examine
these
witnesses?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
let's
assume
that
he
did
cross
examine
them
and
that
he
fairly
discredited
them
in
the
eyes
of
the
magistrate,
would
the
magistrate
would
have
held
this
man
over
or
discharged
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
now
isn't
the
man
somewhat
in
need
of
counsel
at
a
time
like
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
district
court
of
appeals
of
maryland?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
does
the
magistrate
set
that
guilty
plea
aside?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
it's
really
maybe
the
defended
call
a
witness
in
his
only
at
the
preliminary
examination,
he
may
not.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weisgal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
weisgal
before
you
sit
down
i
would
like
to
express
the
thanks
of
the
court
to
you
for
having
represented
this
indigent
defendant.
i
understand
you
were
appointed
by
the
court
below
to
represent
him
and
we
are
always
comforted
to
know
that
lawyers
are
willing
to
give
their
time
and
energy
to
indigent
defendants
in
the
cause
of
justice.
so
we
thank
you
for
it
and
mr.
sweeney
we
thank
you
for
you
fair
diligent
manner
in
which
you
represented
the
interests
of
your
state.
