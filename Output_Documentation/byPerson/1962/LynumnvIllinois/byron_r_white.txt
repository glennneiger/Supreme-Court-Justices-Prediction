was
there
any

to
having

make

prior

(inaudible)

or
was
it
the
--
we're
really
talking
about
the
officer's
testimony?
justice

are
we
--
are
we
talking
about
the
her
testimony
--
we're
talking
about
--
justice
byron

white
and
that
was
clearly
sustained?
justice
byron

white
as
a
result
of
an
unlawful
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
talking
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
talking
about
a
coerced
confession?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
otherwise,
you
would
have
had
to
make
an
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
suppressing
the
oral
confession.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
--
there
is
no
hearing,
a
state
court
finding
(inaudible)
as
to
whether
or
not
this
confession
was
obtained
by
(inaudible)
there
is
no
expressed
finding
one
way
or
another
on
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
doesn't
mean
to
see
--
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
confession
was
induced
by
promises
of
leniency,
that
there
were
strong
suggestions
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
leniency
made,
that
there
is
no
expressed
finding
that's
obtained
by
a
counsel.
justice
byron
r.
white
strong
suggestions
of
leniency.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
were
suggestions
of
leniency
but
it
didn't
resolve
what
the
consequence
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
--
you
don't
--
you
really
are
stating
this
thing,
(inaudible)
do
you
--
do
you
think
you
would
make
the
same
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
this
the
only
ground
that
--
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
considered
the
federal
question
and
they
kept
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
(inaudible)
has
rejected
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
it
rejected
it
and
you're
only
--
your
only
reason
is
that
this
is
a
judgment
of
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
exactly
on
federal
ground,
that
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
get
it,
except
that
it
was
necessary
that
you
think
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
did
they
do
with
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
do
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it's
just
a
harmless
error,
on
what
you're
arguing?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
so
it
is
this
--
this
is
a
--
the
harmless
error
rule
ought
to
apply
where
there's
judges
in
the
jury?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
situation
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
would
you
say
that
justice
schaefer
couldn't
possibly
have
done
anything
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
did
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
the
trial
judges
denied
the
motion
to
strike
the
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
page
40
of
the
record
here,
the
judge
has
denied
the
motion
to
strike
the
officer's
testimony
which
contained
the
confession.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
motion
is
practically
denied.
these
--
i
don't
know
why
he
--
if
he
was
so
sure
that
he
went
through
this
mental
process
of
saying,
“yes,
we
have
a
confession
but
it
was
simply,
i
can't
rely
on
it.”
he
would
have
nailed
that
there
and
gone
through
the
normal
process
of
--
of
grating
the
motion
to
strike.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes,
but
you
don't
--
if
this
--
if
this
judge
hasn't
sustained
the
objection
after
an
offer
of
proof
of
what
the
officer
is
going
to
say,
had
sustained
the
objection
of
that
point
or
had
granted
the
motion
to
strike,
i
doubt
that
this
case
would
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
--
what
you're
about
to
say
is
already
covered
by
our
present
standing.
