but
even
half
the
supreme
court
said
that,
that's
inconclusive
upon
us
as
a
conclusion.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
everything
that
bears
on
this
provided
in
this
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
don't
think
i
put
myself
clearly
enough.
i
mean,
on
the
facts
of
everything
here,
that
they're
on
the
question
of
this
professional
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
all
the
facts
are
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
she
was
in
her
bedroom?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
wines,
may
i
just
ask
this
to
what,
do
i
understand
what
--
what
you're
telling
us
about
the
certificate
here
that
the
supreme
court
decision
did
not
rest
upon
a
finding
adverse
to
the
federal
claim.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see.
what
you're
saying
is
this
is
not
like
irwin
and
dowd,
like
first
irvin
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
first
irwin
and
dowd
where
we
found
that
of
two
grounds,
a
state
ground
and
the
federal
ground,
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
decision,
in
fact,
rested
upon
a
decision
of
the
federal
question.
now,
what
you're
telling
us
here
is
that
we
must
read
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
opinion
although
it
dealt
with
the
federal
question
as
not
resting
its
decision
upon
the
federal
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
had
they
rest
it,
they
had
reversed
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
just
what
they're
saying
in
these
two
sentences,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
there's
a
jury?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
where
there's
--
where
there's
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
point
is
they
agreed
that
it
was.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
please,
if
you
don't
mind
to
get
back
to
my
question
at
the
moment.
i'll
assume
that
they
said
it.
they
said
this
was
a
coerced
confession
and
it
was
a
confession
which
was
inadmissible
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
where
do
we
go
from
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
affirmed
after
all,
where
--
on
what
basis?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
played
no
part
in
the
conviction
that
you
mean
because
there
was
extrinsic
evidence
independent
of
the
--
of
the
confession,
that's
not
what
i
meant
though.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
to
get
over
that
one,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean
by
that
mr.
wines?
we
have
to
assume,
even
though
there's
nothing
said
about
it,
that
the
trial
judge
said
to
himself,
“of
course,
i
can't
take
that
confession.
it's
pertained
to
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
so
i
shut
it
out
of
my
mind
and
i
now
decide
this
case
on
the
rest
of
the
testimonies.”
and
that
when
it
got
to
the
supreme
court,
the
supreme
court
said,
“oh,
that
trial
judge
shut
that
out
of
his
mind
and
decided
this
on
the
other
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
testimonies.”
