justice
john
m.
harlan
was
that
of
any
significance
in
view
of
the
supreme
court
certificate?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
since
you
could
well-afford
to
rest
on
the
supreme
court's
certificate
on
that
finding.
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
--
supposing
the
illinois
supreme
court
are
putting
another
sentence
and
said,
“having
evaluated
this
record,
will
you
think
that
despite
those
representations
or
promises
of
leniency,
this
was
a
free
and
voluntary
statement.”
what
would
you
say
to
that?
justice
john
m.
harlan
supposing
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
had
added
another
sentence
and
said
that
despite
these
promises
that
are
referred
to
here,
we
find
this
was
a
voluntary
statement.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
her
mind
was
not
overborne.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
take
a
look
at
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
this
record
show
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
whether
this
lady
had
any
prior
convictions?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
then,
that
ends
your
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what's
the
significance
of
your
standpoint
of
the
supreme
court
certificate
that
it
passed
on
the
question
--
in
the
federal
question
and
necessarily
did
so?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
you're
saying
is
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
bad,
this
record
is
so
bad
that
it
just
can't
be
so.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
lead
--
lead
us
over
the
hill
so
i
could
see
what
--
where
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
you'll
bring
this
out.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that
don't
actually
--
the
pros
of
the
certificate
then,
that
they
were
given
a
certificate
that
they
had
passed,
necessarily
passed
on
the
decision,
and
they
would
have
said,
“no,
we
didn't
pass
on
that
question
because
neither
the
trial
court
nor
ourselves
paid
any
attention
to
the
admission.”
