may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court.
the
petitioner
herein
was
tried
and
convicted
for
the
unlawful
sale
and
possession
of
narcotics.
and
her
convictions
affirmed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
she
sought
certiorari
on
the
ground
that
the
confession
obtained
from
her
by
threats
and
promises
was
used
against
her
in
her
trial
in
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
this
court
granted
certiorari
upon
receipt
from
the
illinois
supreme
court
of
a
certificate
that
decision
of
the
federal
claim
refer
to
in
the
order
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
was
necessary,
was
necessary
to
the
judgment
rendered
by
the
illinois
supreme
court.
the
people's
testimony
reveals
that
on
january
17th,
1959,
an
informer,
one
zeno,
who
had
been
previously
convicted
of
the
unlawful
sale
of
narcotics,
was
again
in
the
custody
of
illinois
officials
for
again
violating
the
narcotic
laws.
he
agreed
with
his
arresting
officers
upon
promises
of
leniency
by
the
said
officers
to
set
up
an
undisclosed
third
party
for
the
crime
of
the
sale
of
narcotics,
wanting
to
keep
from
going
to
the
penitentiary
if
he
possibly
could,
as
will
appear
on
page
21
of
the
record,
this
informer
took
the
arresting
police
officers
bryson's,
sims
and
kobar
to
the
apartment
building
where
petitioner
resided.
alone,
he
gained
admittance
to
the
apartment.
inside
that
apartment,
there
were
three
people
present,
namely
the
petitioner,
the
informer
zeno,
and
a
visitor.
zeno
was
out
of
the
presence
or
sight
of
the
police
officers
from
10
to
15
minutes.
he
later
emerged
from
the
doorway
leading
to
the
apartment,
rejoined
the
arresting
officers
and
handed
them
a
package
which
contained
marijuana.
he
told
them
that
the
petitioner
had
given
it
to
him,
had
sold
it
to
him.
it
is
uncontroverted
that
the
arresting
officers
were
not
present
at
the
time
of
the
alleged
sale,
and
that
they
relied
upon
the
word
of
zeno
that
the
petitioner
sold
the
narcotics
to
him.
followed
by
the
police
officers,
zeno
returned
to
the
petitioner's
apartment
and
then
she
opened
the
door,
she
was
arrested.
she
was
grabbed
by
both
her
hands
and
she
was
told
by
officer
sims
that
she
had
unlawfully
sold
narcotics
to
zeno.
she
was
then
taken
back
into
her
apartment,
to
the
bedroom,
if
you
please,
flanked
by
two
police
officers.
in
her
own
behalf,
she
protested
for
innocence.
now,
while
in
that
bedroom,
officer
sims
had
adroitly
inquired
whether
petitioner
had
any
children,
noticing
ad
bringing
up
the
fact
that
there
was
children's
clothing
in
the
bedroom.
he
also
inquired
quite
adroitly
about
her
subsistence.
and
he
found
out
that
she
had
two
little
children
ages
3
and
4
that
she
was
receiving
state
funds
in
order
to
help
support
those
children,
state
funds
from
what
is
called
aid
to
dependent
children
in
illinois
or
adc.
and
then
he
said
at
page
35
of
the
record,
“if
we
take
you
into
the
station
and
charge
you
with
the
offense,
the
adc
would
be
probably
be
cut
off
and
you
will
probably
lose
custody
of
your
children.”
he
also
said
that
during
that
same
conversation,
he
promised
to
recommend
leniency
to
the
state
if
the
petitioner
would
cooperate.
then
and
only
then,
the
petitioners
said
“yes,
i
did
sell
it
to
him”.
this
confession
of
a
guilt
of
the
petitioner
brought
out
by
illinois
on
direct
examination
of
his
own
witness,
we
submit
was
timely
objected
to
on
the
basis
of
having
--
the
confession
having
been
induced
by
promises
of
immunity
at
the
trial
level.
and
the
objection
was
preserved
by
a
later
motion
to
strike.
and
the
statement
was
also
made
at
that
time
that
the
objection
was
made
because
the
confession
was
made
under
promises
of
leniency.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
at
that
point
–-
ms.
jewel
lafontant
at
that
point,
the
federal
ground
was
not
stated
in
particularity.
the
only
statement
was
(voice
overlap)
–-
ms.
jewel
lafontant
no.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
that
that
appears
at
page
27
of
the
record.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
well,
in
my
interpretation,
i
would
say
that
it
was
in
that
--
the
general
statement
was
made
that
the
petitioner
had
been
denied
her
rights
since
i
understand
it
because
she
--
this
confession
was
coerced,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
was
threatened
with
having
children
taken
away
from
her,
that
was
brought
out,
but
it
was
not
specifically
spelled
out,
that
the
particular
provision
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
being
violated.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
i
would
say
not,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
supreme
court
certificate
--
i
would
say
first
that
even
without
the
supreme
court's
certificate,
by
looking
at
the
evidence
as
a
whole
that
--
it
would
not
beyond
--
be
beyond
the
realm
of
reasonableness
to
say
that
the
question
was
actually
brought
up.
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
was
raised
very
specifically
in
the
supreme
court's
brief,
and
in
view
of
the
fact,
the
certificate
from
the
illinois
supreme
court
states
that
it
did
consider
the
constitutional
question,
that
he
did
consider
it,
and
then
it
was
necessary
for
its
decision,
i
think
would
render
the
question
moot
in
the
view
of
all
of
these.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
well
i
--
i
don't
wish
to
rest
upon
anything
until
my
half
hour
is
up.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
the
order
itself
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
yes,
well
--
ms.
jewel
lafontant
the
order
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
was
directed
to
the
illinois
supreme
court
to
answer
the
question
whether
or
not
the
illinois
supreme
court
had
considered
pages
66
of
petitioner's
brief
in
the
supreme
court
and
it
was
quoted
that
it
was
unfair
to
make
a
promise
--
mimic
on
a
promise,
coerce
a
confession
and
then
use
that
confession
as
evidence,
that's
what
was
substantially.
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
answered
and
said
that
it
did
consider
that
question,
the
federal
question.
i
believe
i
do
have
a
copy
of
that
order
in
my
notes.
now,
i
--
we
submit
that
the
in
--
inadmissibility
of
this
confession
was
presented
in
the
appeal
brief
just
referred
to
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
again
raised
with
particularity
in
the
petitioner's
--
petition
for
a
rehearing.
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
argues
that
the
constitutional
question
was
not
aptly
asserted
in
accordance
with
illinois
principles.
he
ignores
the
nature
of
the
right
claimed
by
petitioner
to
have
been
violated.
you
well
know
that
a
similar
question
was
raised
and
passed
upon
by
this
court
in
brown
versus
mississippi,
297
u.s.
276.
and
it
said
on
the
following
words,
“that
contention
rest
upon
the
failure
of
counsel
for
the
accused,
who
had
objected
to
the
admissibility
of
the
confessions
to
move
for
their
exclusion
after
they
had
been
introduced
and
the
fact
of
coercion
had
been
proved.
it
is
a
contention
which
proceeds
upon
a
misconception
of
the
nature
of
petitioner's
complaint.
that
complaint
is
not
of
the
commission
of
mere
error
but
of
a
wrong
so
fundamental,
that
it
made
the
whole
proceeding
a
mere
pretense
of
the
trial,
and
rendered
the
conviction
and
sentence
wholly
void.
we're
not
concerned
with
a
mere
question
of
state
practice,
or
where
the
counsel
assigned
the
petitioners
were
competent
or
mistakenly
assumed
that
their
first
objections
were
sufficient.”
if
the
attorney
general
of
illinois
contends
the
principles
of
trials
and
appellate
judicature
of
a
state
would
be
sufficient
to
withdraw
from
the
consideration
of
this
court,
violation
of
such
substitute
rights
as
here
presented,
it
would
be
tantamount
to
giving
a
state
the
right
to
nullify
the
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
such
preemptive
rights,
we
submit,
are
inconceivable.
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
confession
obtained
by
promises
of
leniency,
duress,
or
coercion
when
admitted
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant
vitiates
the
whole
proceeding
and
is
a
denial
of
the
due
process
clause
of
fourteenth
amendment.
it
is
true
that
in
this
case
we
didn't
have
the
gross
brutality
that
we
have
in
the
brown
versus
mississippi
one.
but
this
court
has
also
recognized
the
coercion
of
the
mind
is
of
the
same
nature
and
sometimes
greater
than
physical
violence.
in
spano
versus
new
york,
360
u.s.
315,
the
investigators
extracts
the
confession
from
the
defendant
by
having
his
close
friend
bruno
urged
the
defendant
to
confess.
because
bruno,
who
was
a
fledging
police
officer,
stated
to
spano,
that
if
he
didn't
confess,
that
he
would
be
in
a
bad
spot,
and
because
of
a
prior
phone
call
in
an
admission
that
it
had
been
made
to
bruno.
and
in
that
case,
it
was
held
that
the
confession
was
really
involuntary.
and
i
know,
chief
justice
warren
remembers
it
and
knows
in
much
more
thoroughly
than
i
could
ever
hope
to.
in
brown
versus
united
states
at
168
u.s.
532,
there's
another
instance
of
a
similar
case.
in
this
case
and
when
i
say
a
similar
case,
a
case
where
actual
brutality
wasn't
used.
the
defendant
brown
was
induced
into
incriminating
himself
after
the
police
officer
told
him,
“brown
said
he
saw
you
do
the
murder.
i'm
satisfied
you
do
murder.
you
must
have
had
an
accomplice.
if
so,
you
should
say
so
and
not
have
the
blame
of
this
horrible
crime
on
your
shoulders.”
and
the
incriminating
statements
that
were
made
by
brown
in
that
case
were
held
to
be
involuntary.
and
in
rogers
versus
richmond,
365
u.s.
534,
the
confession
that
the
defendant
gave
was
held
to
be
involuntarily
merely
because
the
police
had
threatened
to
bring
his
arthritic
wife
in
for
interrogation.
and
there,
the
court
said,
“the
attention
of
the
trial
judge
should
have
been
focused
on
the
question
whether
the
behavior
of
state
law
enforcement
officials
was
such
as
to
overbear
the
petitioner's
will
to
resist
and
bring
about
confession
not
freely
self-determined.”
i
submit
that
in
this
case
the
threat
was
to
what
is
--
what
is
dearest
for
a
mother,
the
custody
and
the
care
of
her
two
little
children.
and
i
also
submit
that
she
had
a
further
inducement
and
that
--
that
further
inducement
was
a
promise
of
leniency.
petitioner
confessed
her
guilt,
it's
true
but
such
a
confession
should
--
could
hardly
be
considered
a
voluntary
one.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
i
would
say
so,
your
honor,
yes.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
would
you
repeat
that
please.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
i
don't
--
ms.
jewel
lafontant
well,
i
would
say,
it
would
make
no
difference
because
these
facts
would
definitely
disprove
that
statement.
and
i
would
say
this
that
when
any
promise
is
made,
no
matter
how
slight,
that
we
cannot
possibly
weigh
what
influence
such
a
promise
would
have
upon
the
mind
of
a
person.
now,
that's
why
i
had
presented
these
other
cases
where
it
was
shown,
i
thought
the
weakest
one
possibly
was
in
this
spano
case
versus
new
york,
where
--
not
spano
in
the
--
yes,
in
the
spano
case
versus
new
york
where
was
just
the
word
of
a
friend
say
--
by
him
saying,
“i'll
get
into
trouble
if
you
don't
confess.”
and
they
say,
well
that's
involuntary.
well
certainly,
if
a
person
is
not
close
to
you,
any
closer
than
a
friend,
if
what
would
come
to
him,
what
harm
might
come
to
him
would
make
you
confess
and
the
court
would
hold
that
that's
involuntary,
i
certainly
would
say
that
even
if
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
would
say,
“well,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they've
said
they're
going
to
take
her
children
away
from
her,
and
she
wouldn't
have
any
funds,”
i
would
say
--
they
couldn't
possibly
say
that
in
view
of
these
cases,
in
view
of
this
court's
prior
ruling.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
i
would
say
it
is
not
conclusive
upon
the
supreme
court
of
united
states,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
or
of
any
other
state
can
bring
out
the
right
of
this
court
to
look
into
basic
fundamental
constitutional
issues.
and
you
certainly,
this
court
would
certainly
have
the
right
to
look
into
the
record,
and
you
could
make
the
determination
whether
or
not
the
confession
was
voluntary.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
that's
one
apology
i
wished
to
say
--
i
wished
to
make
because
on
the
second
section
of
the
spano
case
and
the
rogers
versus
richmond
case,
those
two
cases
are
not
in
the
record.
i
would
say
mainly
because
there
was
no
rebuttal
brief
filed
to
the
attorney
general's
brief
in
which
he
raised
the
issue.
and
now
that
i
am
in
oral
argument,
i
have
added
these
two
cases
--
ms.
jewel
lafontant
but
if
you
want
me
to
--
ms.
jewel
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
all
of
the
facts
are
in
the
record,
your
honor.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
there
is
--
there
is
no
dispute
whatsoever.
the
facts
that
i
stated
at
the
opening
were
the
facts
as
submitted
by
the
state
with
the
exception
of
my
--
of
the
petitioner's
statement
that
she
had
denied
her
guilt.
but
everything
else
there,
i
took
out
of
the
record
from
the
state's
own
case,
of
officer
sims,
stated
that
he
promised
her
leniency,
he
also
stated
that
he
--
that
probably
her
children
would
be
taken
away.
in
addition
to
his
own
statement,
officer
bryson
said
he
overheard
a
similar
conversation
and
it
that
all
three
of
the
officers
sort
of
joined
in
with
these
promises
of
leniency.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
no
dispute
over
the
facts
in
my
opinion.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
a
motion
to
suppress
was
made
prior
to
trial
and
a
motion
to
suppress
was
sustained
prior
to
trial.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
a
motion
to
--
let
me
make
it
clear
--
ms.
jewel
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
no.
we
were
talking
about
the
officer's
testimony.
there
was
no
motion
made
to
strike
her
testimony.
her
testimony
was
only
given
after
a
motion
to
strike
the
officer's
testimony
was
denied
and
she
was
put
to
the
in
--
to
defend
herself.
there
was
no
motion
to
strike
her
testimony
at
all.
but
there
was
a
general
motion
to
suppress
as
i
recall
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial
to
suppress
all
the
evidence
that
had
been
adduced
as
a
result
of
an
unlawful
search.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
and
that
was
sustained.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
that's
right.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
the
actual
confession
there
was
--
ms.
jewel
lafontant
there
was
no
actual
motion
to
suppress
the
oral
confession
because
as
i
understand
the
record,
there
was
no
notice
that
the
oral
confessions
were
going
to
be
used
prior
to
the
trial.
so
that
motion
was
not
made
prior
to
the
trial.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
i
would
think
so.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
i
would
think
so.
we
have
notice.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
yes.
the
oral
confession
was
made
as
soon
as
they
went
into
the
bedroom,
as
i
understand
the
testimony,
she
was
just
told
that
she
--
that
zeno
had
set
her
up
and
that
she
had
actually
made
a
sale
of
narcotics
which
she
denied.
at
that
time,
they
started
a
general
conversation
and
there
was
no
mention
of
the
search
having
been
made
prior
to
the
oral
confession.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
yes,
that's
--
they've
got
it,
yes.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
in
this
particular
case,
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
that
--
ms.
jewel
lafontant
justice
solfisburg,
at
page
73
of
the
record
states,
“a
review
of
the
record
does
indicate,
however,
that
strong
suggestions
of
leniency
were
made
to
defendant
subsequent
to
her
arrest
and
prior
to
her
admissions.”
ms.
jewel
lafontant
yes
sir.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
no,
but
i
believe
that,
from
his
own
word,
from
the
wording
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
however,
that
you
might
read
between
the
lines
and
see
that
after
an
arrest
and
prior
to
the
admission
that
promises
were
made,
they
don't
go
into
what
they
were,
but
if
they
do
say,
strong
promises
of
leniency.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
strong
suggestions
of
leniency.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
that's
right.
but
i
submit
that
the
state's
own
case
tells
us
what
the
consequences
were
and
tells
us
specifically
what
promises
were
made
and
leads
it
to
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
were
induced
by
coercion.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
i
don't
believe
it
would
have
made
--
it
would
have
made
any
difference
in
this
matter.
i
would
still
--
i
would
think
that
the
same
principle
that
has
been
determined
that
you
cannot
possibly
weigh
the
amount
of
influence
of
a
promise
that
if
she
raised
the
question
(voice
overlap)
in
proper
time
that
it
would
be
--
ms.
jewel
lafontant
--
you
could
(voice
overlap)
involuntary.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
she
wanted
to
put
something
over
on
the
state.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
i
believe
that
this
court
would
have
the
power
to
look
into
it
--
ms.
jewel
lafontant
--
and
see
if
the
rights
are
--
ms.
jewel
lafontant
--
are
violated.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
i
haven't
read
shotwell
that
was
decided
two
weeks
ago,
no.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
thank
you.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
well,
from
what
you
said,
i
don't
think
the
facts
there
wouldn't
mind
ours
either,
so
that
it
perhaps
isn't
applicable
and
shouldn't
hurt
me.
it
just
hurts
me
in
not
being
able
to
respond
in
your
question.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
quite
a
different
thing.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
no
question
about
it
at
all,
flanked
by
two
officers.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
flanked
by
two
police
officers.
there
was
no
question
about
the
fact
that
she
was
in
police
custody,
both
of
her
hands
were
taken.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
and
they
directed
her
into
her
bedroom,
yes.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
i
would
go
that
far,
but
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
to
go
--
ms.
jewel
lafontant
very
good.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
the
court
didn't.
the
second
contention
of
respondent
is
that
the
petitioner's
conviction
does
not
rest
in
whole
or
in
part
upon
petitioners
confession
and
i
believe
in
the
discussion
that
we've
had
already
that
that
has
been
covered,
but
that
was
the
next
part
of
my
argument
that
i
was
going
to
--
go
into.
but
the
line
of
cases,
with
the
spano
versus
new
york
case,
malinski
versus
new
york
324
u.s.
401,
and
blackburn
versus
alabama
361
u.s.
199,
this
court
has
held
that
a
conviction
obtained
by
use
of
coerced
confessions
will
be
set
aside
even
though
the
evidence
apart
from
the
confession
might
have
been
sufficient
to
sustain
the
verdict.
the
respondent
further
advances
the
theory
that
involuntary
confessions
admitted
over
the
objection
of
the
defendant,
do
not
violate
the
constitutional
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
the
personality
of
the
trier
of
facts
have
changed
from
that
of
the
jury
to
the
judge.
we
submit
that
the
waiver
of
a
jury
by
the
defendant
cannot
be
claimed
to
be
a
waiver
of
the
basic
constitutional
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
its
opinion,
the
supreme
court
as
you've
heard
stated
that
strong
suggestions
of
leniency
were
made.
but
that
after
looking
at
a
review
of
the
entire
record,
the
supreme
court
said,
“we
are
convinced
that
the
evidence
fully
supports
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court.”
in
the
light
of
spano
line
of
cases
heretofore
referred
to,
we
submit
that
this
was
error,
that
the
admission
of
the
involuntary
confession
of
petitioner
over
her
objections
vitiated
the
whole
proceeding
that
the
finding
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
that
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
to
support
the
conviction
does
not
add
sanctity
to
conduct
long
adjudication
by
this
court
as
reprehensible
and
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause.
we,
therefore,
respectfully
pray
that
this
court
set
aside
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
remand
the
case
to
the
state
court.
ms.
jewel
lafontant
yes,
the
record
is
clear
that
she
had
never
been
convicted
and
certainly
had
never
even
been
arrested
for
anything
prior
to
this
time.
thank
you
very
much.
