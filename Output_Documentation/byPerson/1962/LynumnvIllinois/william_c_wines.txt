mr.
william
c.
wines
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
begin
the
argument
for
illinois
by
the
unqualified
concession
that
the
conversations
between
the
petitioner
and
the
police
officer
ultimating
in
her
confession
were
coercive
and
did
deny
her
due
process
of
law
within
so
far
as
i
know
not
only
every
decision
of
this
court
but
within
the
purview
of
every
opinion
of
any
justice
in
this
field
with
which
i
am
familiar.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
by
no
means,
your
honor.
and
after
i
have
expatiated
a
little
longer
submission,
i'm
going
to
state
and
then
earnestly
press
the
thesis
on
which
illinois
asks
this
court
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
your
honor
i
did,
but
in
view
of
the
questions
from
the
bench,
i
thought
it
might
be
well
to
make
it
orally.
mr.
william
c.
wines
within
the
meaning
of
the
due
process
clause,
yes,
that
it
was
obtained
by
violation
of
the
petitioner's
constitutional
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
that's
my
contention.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
your
honor,
because
it's
my
earnest
contention
that
i
shall
press
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
not
counsel
appointed
by
the
court,
but
counsel
--
not
counsel
who
represents
her
here,
but
counsel
in
the
trial
court
chose
at
least
compatibly
and
perhaps
in
the
signal
exemplification
of
the
best
strategy
of
advocacy
trying
this
case
without
a
jury
instead
of
effectively
trying
to
have
this
confession
excluded,
chose
to
exploit
it
in
petitioner's
behalf.
and
also
that
in
this
case,
well
--
also
that
in
this
case,
it
affirmatively
appears
in
the
record
not
by
inference
or
innuendo
that
this
petitioner's
confession
did
not
re
--
i
mean
this
petitioner's
conviction
on
the
sentence,
did
not
rest
in
whole
or
in
part
upon
this
confession.
a
situation
that
can't
be
present
in
a
case
that
has
tried
by
a
jury
which
has
been
permitted
to
hear
a
confession
obtained
under
circumstances
and
that,
as
is
the
case
here,
clearly
constituted
denial
of
due
process
of
law.
mr.
william
c.
wines
your
honor,
the
motion
to
exclude
because
no
notice
was
given
was
not
in
any
way
an
invocation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
the
motion
to
exclude,
suppress
wasn't,
but
even
if
it
had
been
the
illinois
rule
is
quite
clear,
very
clear
that
it
isn't
enough
in
any
case,
civil
or
criminal
to
make
an
objection
if
the
court
declines
to
rule.
the
illinois
practice
is
that
the
point
is
waived
unless
counsel
explicitly
requests
a
ruling.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well
it
did
pass
on.
it
did
pass
on
it.
and
i
can
assure
your
honors
from
reading
this
opinion
and
from
my
intimate
acquaintance
with
that
court
that
they
passed
on
it
in
this
way.
they
say
so,
in
almost
so
many
words,
that
they
considered
the
federal
question
whether
this
confession
was
extorted
or
obtained
by
du
--
duress
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
held
that
it
was,
and
held
that
it
played
no
part
in
the
trial
courts
or
their
court's
conviction.
that's
the
meaning
of
that
certificate,
not
that
it
approved
this
method
of
getting
a
confession.
maybe
if
i
can
talk
in
terms
of
the
effect
--
and
by
the
way,
the
counsel
is
quite
correct
when
in
answer
to
a
question
from
mr.
justice
brennan
she
said,
“there's
no
dispute
about
the
objective
facts
of
this
confession.”
there
is
as
to
zeno's
testimony
that
--
the
informer's
testimony
that
she
sold
him
the
narcotics
which
is
unqualified
accusation
in
her
testimony
that
she
didn't
which
is
an
unqualified
denial.
but
the
version
--
by
the
way,
mrs.
lafonant's
statement
to
the
court
here
was
exceptionally
fair
and
lucid
and
accurate
and
relieves
me
of
the
burden
of
restating
the
facts,
but
casts
on
me
a
considerable
burden
of
discussing
it.
now,
the
facts
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
and
the
finding
favorable
to
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
like
what?
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
correct,
exactly.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
it's
the
part
of
the
opinion
that
it's
exactly
the
same
part
of
the
opinion
that
counsel
for
petitioner
have
not
read,
but
i
should
like
to
read
it
again.
i'm
reading
it
from
page
9
of
my
brief
quote
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
73.
mr.
william
c.
wines
“a
review
of
the
record
does
indicate,
however,
that
strong
suggestion
of
leniency,
suggestions
of
leniency
were
made
to
defendant
subsequent
to
her
arrest
and
prior
to
her
admissions.
even
in
the
absence
of
defendant's
statement,
there's
a
clear
proof
by
zeno
and
the
police
officers
that
the
defendant
gave
a
package
containing
marijuana.”
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
think
so
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
has
been
so
very
clearly
held
so
many
times
by
this
court
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
must
know
and
as
often
as
this
court
is
held,
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
has
held
it
even
the
oftener.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
(voice
overlap)
no,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
answer
all
of
these
questions
in
terms
of
the
undisputed
facts
of
this
case,
and
i
am
not
passing
the
question.
i'm
trying
to
lay
the
factual
basis
for
my
argument.
these
are
the
undisputed
facts,
who
is
the
petitioner?
is
she
a
sophisticated,
wealthy,
gangster
or
gangstress
of
the
chicago
underworld,
equipped
with
long
experience
with
the
fifth
amendment?
not
at
all.
she
is
a
woman
on
relief
with
children
three
and
four
years
old
in
a
neighborhood
that's
impoverished
that
appears
almost
as
a
matter
of
judicial
notice
from
anybody
who
knows
anything
about
addresses
in
chicago.
she's
accused
not
of
parking
violation,
but
she's
undoubtedly,
she
didn't
know
what
the
penalty
was,
but
of
a
severe
crime,
the
unlawful
sale
of
narcotics
which
illinois
punishes
when
she
was
sentenced
in
this
case,
10
to11
years.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
recall,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
remember.
mr.
william
c.
wines
not
less
than
10
or
more
than
11
years
in
the
penitentiary.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
no,
not
by
any
terms.
now,
two
police
officers
came.
there's
an
accusation
that
she
sold
narcotics
to
a
confessed
peddler
who's
trying
to
make
a
deal
for
himself
as
far
as
i
know,
he
did.
because
illinois
is
better
by
keeping
its
deals
with
informers
and
it
is
with
those
who
confessed.
now,
here's
this
one
who's
told
not
just
that
if
she
doesn't
confess
and
she
is
convicted,
she'll
get
as
more
severe
sentence
than
if
she
is
convicted
in
spite
a
denial,
or
on
standing
mute.
the
police
didn't
stop
there
with
extortion.
they
indicated
to
her,
the
diction
is
in
text
--
just
intimation,
but
in
texture,
its
intimidation.
they
told
her
in
just
so
many
words
weren't
very
new
today,
that
if
she
didn't
confess
whether
she
was
convicted
or
not,
she
was
the
one
to
lose
custody
to
her
two
children
in
any
way,
they
did
more
than
that.
and
her
counsel
neglected
to
mention
this
which
is
a
very
serious
threat
in
chicago.
they
threatened
to
take
her
off
what
we
call
adc
which
means
her
aid
to
dependent
children
stops,
and
she
gets
no
checks.
and
how
she
feeds
them,
i
wouldn't
know,
unless
of
course
she
then
begins
some
other
criminal
career
than
that
with
which
she
was
accused
here.
now,
the
reason
i
deal
later
on
and
expatiate
on
the
actual
circumstances
which
are
a
good
deal
of
words
than
petitioner's
counsel,
narration
would
lead
is
to
show
that
in
order
to
think
that
this
confession
rested
in
any
--
that
this
conviction
rested
in
--
how
could
this
rested
in
any
part
or
not
confession,
you
would
have
to
say
that
an
experienced
judge
of
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction,
the
criminal
court
of
cook
county,
not
a
justice
of
the
peace
or
magistrate.
and
the
unanimous
supreme
court
of
illinois
including
as
i
think
its
then
the
chief
justice,
mr.
justice
schaefer
whose
contributions
to
the
law
of
evidence,
he's
a
distinguished
professor
of
that
subject
to
northwestern,
you
can
ask
mr.
justice
goldberg
about
it.
you
would
have
to
say
that
men
like
mr.
justice
schaefer,
mr.
justice
solfisburg,
mr.
justice
dailey
who's
been
on
that
court
for
very
nearly
20
years
were
oblivious
of
all
your
honor's
decisions
on
this
point,
on
their
own
decisions.
they've
always
held
that
a
confession
induced
by
promises
of
lenity
is
inadmissible.
as
far
as
the
illinois
law
is
concerned,
you
don't
even
need
the
illinois'
due
process
clause,
the
common
law
of
rule
of
evidence
that
excludes
confessions
on
that.
now
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
just
precisely
and
if
you're
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
will,
very
well
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
very
well,
very
well.
suppose
your
honors,
in
the
first
place,
the
pronouncements
of
your
honors
that
a
confession
that
where
the
admitted
facts
show
that
an
extorted
confession
was
used,
a
conviction
where
there's
a
jury
can't
rest
in
whole
or
in
part
on
that
confession,
and
your
honors
will
not
exceed.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
--
when
as
a
jury
and
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
then,
i
say
the
question
is
entirely
different,
and
that
is
the
heart
of
the
argument
to
which
i'm
coming
right
now.
if
there
were
any
difference
between
cases
tried
by
judges,
i
mean
as
far
as
the
effect
of
coerced
confessions
are
concerned
and
cases
tried
by
jury,
this
rule
would
make
no
more
--
no
sense
at
all
because
either
jurors
would
know
as
much
as
the
members
of
this
court
in
which
case
they'd
pay
no
attention
to
extorted
confessions,
or
the
members
of
this
court
would
no
know
more
than
jurors
in
which
case
they
wouldn't
exclude
them,
so
the
rule
has
to
be
different
for
cases.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes
sir,
and
i'm
as
sure
as
i
can
be
that
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes.
mr.
william
c.
wines
no,
no,
no.
they
didn't
reject
the
petitioner's
contention
that
the
confession
was
--
was
extorted
by
duress.
mr.
william
c.
wines
agreed
to
that
it
was
--
and
then
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
let's
get
to
certificate.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
it
was
necessary
because
petitioner
raised
it
and
it
had
to
do
something
with
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
what
i'm
saying
your
honor,
this
is
not
--
this
is
not
a
sophistical
argument
made
to
keep
an
unfortunate
descendant,
unfortunate
woman
to
the
penitentiary
for
not
less
than
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
say
that
they
--
they
say
just
what
they
say,
strong
suggestions
of
leniency
or
a
lenity
were
made.
now,
when
they
say
that
in
the
context
of
all
of
your
honor's
decisions,
of
all
of
their
own
decisions,
they
have
to
mean
that
that
confession
can't
be
received.
if
they
had
gone
ahead
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
your
honor
i
can't
tell
you
why
a
judge
did
or
didn't
say
anything
in
this
kind
of
a
context,
but
when
they
go
ahead
and
say
even
so,
they
show
that
they
are
paying
no
attention
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
to
this
confession.
mr.
william
c.
wines
just
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
on
the
basis
that
they
had
played
no
part
in
the
conviction
below
and
played
no
part
in
the
affirmance
above.
mr.
william
c.
wines
what?
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes,
which
i
think
is
quite
appropriate
where
there's
no
jury.
mr.
william
c.
wines
if
it's
error.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
yes
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
what
i
mean.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that's
right.
that's
what
i
think.
mr.
william
c.
wines
that
would
not
be
a
correct
certification
of
my
real
understanding
of
this
opinion.
i
think
that
court
did
this,
they
read
petitioner's
briefs.
they
saw
this
confession
extorted
by
promises
versus
threats,
intimations
or
promises
versus
intimations
of
threats.
if
they
didn't
know
about
this
court's
rule
before,
they
certainly
knew
it
when
petitioners
cited
brown
against
mississippi,
if
they
had
not
previously
heard
of
the
rule,
of
course
they
passed
on
it.
here
it
was
in
no
record.
here
is
a
contention
by
a
counsel
that
the
confession
was
ex
--
was
extorted
or
wasn't.
well,
if
it
wasn't
extorted,
it
would
be
substantive
evidence
of
guilt.
so
they
had
to
determine
whether
it
was
extorted.
they
must
have
determined
that
it
was
extorted
because
you
can't
read
these
facts
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
with
any
knowledge.
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
he
didn't.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well,
i
cannot
explain
why
he
did
not
do
it
that
way.
i
cannot.
but
i
just
can't
believe
that
any
criminal
court
judge,
a
jury
yes,
and
any
supreme
court
of
illinois
would
rest
the
conviction
in
whole
or
in
part,
on
this
kind
of
a
confession.
it
imputes
absolute
anarchy
to
a
--
the
bench.
if
the
facts
have
been
a
little
closer,
then
it
might
not
be
so
clear.but
so
--
now,
petitioner
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
does
it
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence
too
in
the
criminal
case
which
this
court
won't
do
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
and
on
the
admissibility.
mr.
william
c.
wines
your
honor,
the
illinois
rule
is
that
where
a
case
is
tried
without
a
jury,
the
judge
is
presumed
or
considered
only
competent
inadmissible
evidence,
and
the
more
clearly
the
evidence
is
inadmissible,
the
clearer
is
the
application
of
that
rule.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
no,
no.
mr.
william
c.
wines
but
in
the
illinois,
the
mere
fact
that
an
objection
to
competent
evidence
is
overruled
when
it
should
be
sustained,
it
doesn't
destroy
the
presumption,
never
has.
now,
it
does
in
the
federal
courts
but
not
in
illinois.
now,
but
in
the
last
few
minutes,
i
would
like
--
i
would
like
to
make
this
point
an
answer
to
this
question,
suppose
your
honors
reverse
and
remand
this
case,
presumably
your
honors
won't
reverse
it
outright
and
set
the
petitioner
free
because
there
is
other
evidence
of
guilt.
so
suppose
your
honors
conclude
that
there
ought
to
be
a
new
trial.
now,
if
this
were
a
case
tried
by
jury,
we'd
get
a
new
jury
to
presumably
would've
heard
nothing
about
this
confession
at
all
and
would
be
free
from
infection
or
contamination
(voice
overlap),
but
what
will
be
the
consequence
if
you
reverse
this?
any
judge
who
tries
this
case
is
going
to
know
about
this
confession.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
doubt
it,
too.
mr.
william
c.
wines
well
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
would
think
so.
i
would
certainly
think
so.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
know.
i
don't
know
of
illinois
law
on
it.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
i'm
completely
unable
to
answer
that
question.
i
simply
don't
know.
i
don't
know
one
bit
more
about
it
than
your
honor
has
to
know.
i
should
--
i
don't
practice
in
the
criminal
courts
and
in
them
for
over
20
years.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
just
don't,
not
even
from
--
i
know
less
about
it
than
i
should
as
a
citizen
of
chicago.
i
just
don't
know
so
i
won't
say
i
do.
now,
if
i'm
wrong,
if
i'm
wrong
about
this,
in
my
argument
and
this
confession
did
play
was
kind
of
uncommon
in
this
petitioner's
conviction,
in
fact,
if
i'm
wrong,
then
it
isn't
as
clear
to
this
court
as
it
is
to
me
that
it
didn't,
then
i'm
not
just
here
to
win
the
case.
this
case
ought
to
be
reversed
and
remanded
and
that
i'm
authorized
after
now
in
my
21st
year
of
practice
before
this
court
for
illinois
and
i'll
make
that
statement
for
illinois.
but
i'm
as
sure
as
i
can
be
that
no
judge
in
illinois
gives
anybody
any
11-year
sentences
on
confessions
like
this.
that's
my
point.
that's
my
only
point
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
said
i'm
as
sure
as
i
can
be
that
no
judge
--
jury,
yes,
but
no
judge
in
illinois
gives
anybody
sentences
like
this
on
the
basis
of
confessions
obtained
as
this
confession
was.
if
i'm
wrong
about
that,
then
illinois
is
wrong
too,
and
this
is
the
time
to
correct
it.
but
i
don't
think
i'm
wrong.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
wines
i
don't
know
anything
about
it,
your
honor.
i
have
no
information
on
or
off
the
record.
mr.
william
c.
wines
oh,
i
think
i
do
know.
i
think
i
do
know.
i
assure
that
they
didn't
refer
to
this
case.
there
was
a
well
--
a
published
difference
of
opinion
in
chicago
between
a
former
state's
attorney
and
a
number
of
judges.
the
former
state's
attorney
was
in
the
newspapers
and
on
television
accusing
a
number
of
judges
of
undue
leniency.
the
judges
and
a
committee
of
--
a
bar
association
investigated
these
charges.
the
judges
replied
with
anarchy.
some
thought
unseemly
energy
to
unseemly
charges
that
being
in
my
own
due
but
they
had
nothing
to
do.i'm
as
sure
as
i
can
be
without
having
read
the
articles
with
the
beatrice
lines
who
did
not
figure
at
all
in
this
debate.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
wines
it
seems
to
me
a
severe
sentence
and
yet
there
is
a
--
i
do
know
in
general
of
the
sentences
in
illinois
are
quite
severe
--
mr.
william
c.
wines
--
quite
severe
in
narcotics
cases.
that's
true.
i'm
indebted
to
petitioner's
counsel's
courtesy
to
say
that
--
i
can't
read
it.
the
minimum
sentence
would
be
five
years
and
she
says
it's
usual,
and
as
far
as
i
know,
i
have
no
reason
to
dispute
her.
