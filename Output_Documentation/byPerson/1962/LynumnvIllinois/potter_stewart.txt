where
does
that
appear
in
the
record,
mrs.

justice

stewart
mrs.
lafontant,
the
certificate
in
which
mr.
justice
harlan
referred
on
page
80
of
the
record
and
it
refers
to
an
order
of
this
court
dated
november
13,
1961.
is
that
order
in
the
record?
justice
potter
stewart
it
says,
of
the
federal
claim
referred
to
in
the
order
of
this
court.
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
how
is
that
federal
claim
verbalized
in
this
court's
order,
do
you
remember
them?
justice
potter
stewart
you
might
find
it
helpful.

justice
potter
stewart
mr.
wines,
now
i
think
i
understand
the
argument
that
you're
making,
but
i
must
say
it's
so
ingenious
that
it
--?
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
it
--
i've
thought
that
this
is
exactly
where
the
error
was
because
it's
been
clearly
held
by
this
court
time
after
time
after
time,
that
when
an
involuntary
confession
is
introduced
in
evidence,
in
a
criminal
trial
against
the
defendant,
there's
no
--
you
can't
constitutionally
say
that
that
was
harmless
error
and
you're
making
a
harmless
error
argument
to
us,
are
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
what
could
the
maximum
sentence
have
been?
justice
potter
stewart
so
there's
no
--
there's
no
suggestion
that
she
--
that
the
promise
was
kept
of
leniency.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
irrebuttable
presumption
now,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
on
page
40
that
presumption
is
rebutted.
there
was
a
motion
to
strike
the
testimony
and
upon
the
grounds
among
others
that
the
evidence
was
inadmissible
and
was
given
under
promises
of
leniency.
and
the
record
says
the
motion
to
strike
was
denied.
