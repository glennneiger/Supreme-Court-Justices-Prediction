justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
she
had
said,
“i'm
confessing,
but
i
want
you
to
particularly
you
understand
that
it's
not
a
result
of
any
promise
you
made.”
what
about
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
(voice
overlap)
specifically
from
that
that
she
didn't
make
the
promise
on
the
count
of
the
inducements.
she
just
wanted
to
put
something
over
on
the
state.
justice
hugo
l.
black
she
probably
put
something
over
on
the
state.
the
court
found
that
she
didn't
do
that
on
the
count
of
the
inducement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
read
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
shotwell?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
read
the
case
of
shotwell
that
was
decided
two
weeks
ago?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
think
you
will.
justice
hugo
l.
black
of
course
this
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
in
that
case,
the
promise
was
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
this
one
is
for
police
force
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
complete
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you're
basing
your
argument
then
on
the
premise
that
a
mere
promise
of
leniency
alone
has
finally
settled
that
the
confession
was
made
that
that
was
induced
by
the
promise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
went
that
far
in
shotwell.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
court
didn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
to
say
you
confessed
that
the
confession
was
coerced.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
mind
pointing
out
a
part
of
the
opinion
of
the
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
is
it
on,
on
the
record?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
didn't
they
say
that
if
that's
what
they
meant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
hence,
gentleman,
it
seems
to
me,
it
would
express
themselves
in
their
opinion
--
i
just
don't
understand
that
argument.
