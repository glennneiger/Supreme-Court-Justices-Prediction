mr.
aronstein,
the
effect
of
the
injunction
is
to
prevent
the
--
cleary
from
testifying
as
to
bolger's
confession,
is
that
correct?
is
that
the
effect
of
it?

now,
the
total
effect
of
the
law
prevent
the

in
the

on
bolger
from

that
evidence
would
have
no
relevancy
if
the
statement
itself
which
had
been
reported
was
not
admitted
into
evidence.

statement
in

by
bolger
were
held
inadmissible
on
constitutional

would
be
just
in
limbo
itself,
it
would
have
no
significance,
would
it?
