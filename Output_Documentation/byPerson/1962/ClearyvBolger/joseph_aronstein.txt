mr.
joseph
aronstein
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
but
two
questions
presented
upon
this
matter
before
this
court
as
set
forth
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
the
first
is
whether
it
is
an
improvident
exercise
of
federal
equitable
power
to
enjoin
the
petitioner
from
testifying
in
either
a
state
court
or
before
the
waterfront
commission
of
the
court
of
new
york.
it
seems
to
me
that
my
opponent
has
avoided
the
very
question
that
was
raised
initially
in
the
district
court
and
also
decided
by
the
circuit
court
and
that
is
this;
what
position
did
cleary
assume
once
he
came
in
and
aided
and
abetted
the
federal
officers
in
committing
these
unlawful
acts.
there
is
no
question
that
the
federal
officers
did
commit
unlawful
acts
because
even
judge
anderson
who
dissented
in
the
circuit
court
from
that
part
of
the
opinion
that
continued
the
injunction
in
effect
because
at
page
23
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
judge
anderson
says
this,
“there
was
a
good
reason
at
the
time
of
the
issuance
of
the
injunction
by
the
trial
court
before
the
supreme
court's
holding
in
mapp
v.
ohio,
supra,
to
encode
within
its
reach,
cleary,
the
state
official,
to
prevent
a
violation
of
bolger's
constitutional
rights”.
so
bolger
then
had
no
other
recourse.
so
i
must
assume
that
judge
anderson
found
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
at
least,
cleary
became
a
federal
agent
when
he
aided
and
abetted
these
federal
agents
in
the
commission
of
this
illegal
act.
and
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
one
who
aides
and
abet
others
in
the
commission
of
any
illegal
act
becomes
a
part
--
possible
(inaudible)
conspiracy
and
any
acts
committed
during
the
conspiracy
are
chargeable,
this
person
at
the
jury
is
before
the
completion
of
the
conspiracy.
now,
while
it
is
true
that
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
confined
their
opinion
to
the
fact
that
cleary
by
being
invited
in
by
the
federal
agents
listened
to
and
observed
certain
things.
but
as
judge
bryan
said
in
his
opinion,
cleary
did
more
than
that.
he
became
an
active
participant
in
these
acts
of
the
customs
officers.
because
when
they
brought
bolger
back
to
201
varick
street,
new
york
city
at
which
time
cleary
had
been
called
by
the
customs
officers,
both
cleary
and
lockland,
one
of
the
federal
customs
officers,
compelled
bolger
to
empty
his
pockets,
questioned
him
about
some
keys
that
he
had
and
when
they
discovered
that
one
of
the
keys
fitted
a
storeroom
in
some
apartment
building,
i
believe
it
was
at
75th
street
western
avenue
in
manhattan,
compelled
bolger
to
accompany
them
in
an
automobile,
took
him
into
this
house,
compelled
him
to
open
the
door
and
conducted
a
search
in
his
premises.
of
course,
the
petitioner
would
like
to
dispose
of
that
matter
by
saying,
well,
there
was
no
contraband
found
there.
but
that
is
not
the
important
thing
whether
or
not
contraband
was
found
there
or
not.
the
important
thing
i
believe
is
that
when
they
forced
bolger
to
empty
his
pockets,
when
they
forced
him
to
accompany
them
to
75th
street,
and
they
forced
him
to
open
the
door,
bolger's
(inaudible)
acts,
it
were
clearly
illegal
acts.
the
same
as
the
other
acts
committed
by
the
federal
officers
prior
to
the
time
they
took
bolger
to
keansburg,
new
jersey.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
agree
with
judge
anderson,
your
honor,
because
if
that's
true
then
you
might
as
well
abolish
5
(a)
because
even
if
federal
agents
come
in
to
a
state
court
you
can
raise
that
question,
i
don't
think
he
can.
i
proceeded
on
the
theory
that
cleary
became
a
federal
officer
for
the
pertinences
of
this
case
at
least
when
he
joined
in
with
these
other
federal
agents.
now,
it
didn't
make
a
better
difference
whether
cleary
was
a
civilian
or
whether
he
was
a
state
officer
or
an
investigator
for
the
waterfront
commission
or
anyway.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
oh
certainly,
the
record
shows
what
cleary
did.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
no,
it
doesn't
to
my
recollection
but
i
don't
believe
that
makes
a
better
difference.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
because
--
let's
assume
that
there
were
a,
b,
c
and
d
in
the
conspiracy
to
violate
the
law,
a
is
the
leader
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
well,
i
assume
that
when
more
than
--
when
two
people
or
more
engage
in
an
illegal
enterprise,
that
could
become
a
cons
--
criminal
conspiracy
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
--
whereas
if
one
person
did
it,
it
might
not.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
no,
it
is
not
but
it
is
my
view
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
this
was
conducted
within
the
private
offices
of
the
customs
officials,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
anybody
to
stumble
in.
i
mean
that
would
be
assuming
something
that
would
--
to
my
mind,
it
would
be
almost
impossible
because
if
anybody
did
come
in
there
that
wasn't
permitted
there,
they'd
be
properly
chased
out.
that's
a
government
building,
the
customs
office
and
this
was
upstairs
in
the
building,
it
was
a
saturday
and
they
have
guards
there
so
that
the
probability
of
anybody
just
stumbling
in
on
these
proceeding
which
was
conducted
in
private
offices
maintained
by
the
customs
officials
is
a
very,
very
remote
possibility
and
i
don't
think
could
be
considered
at
all.
now,
i
believe
that
not
only
did
judge
bryan
but
the
prevailing
opinion
in
the
circuit
court
disposed
of
that
question
very
aptly
and
at
page
17,
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
where
there
appears
the
opinion
of
judge
clark
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion.
he
said,
in
the
rea
case,
a
federal
official
was
disabled
from
passing
the
fruits
of
his
illegal
activities
on
to
the
state
through
testimony
at
a
trial.
in
the
present
case,
the
federal
officials
attempted
to
pass
the
fruits
of
their
illegal
activities
on
to
the
state
by
calling
in
state
officials
at
the
time
of
the
illegal
detention.
now
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
cleary
was
called
in
by
the
federal
official.
that's
not
disputed.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
so
i
say,
so
having
him
on
--
invited
there
by
the
federal
officials
and
haven't
taken
it
--
taken
an
active
part
in
this
illegal
act
he
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
the
rea
case
became
a
federal
official
and
he
is
amenable
to
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
and
he
is
also
amenable
to
the
provisions
of
the
constitution
if
he
has
violated
any
of
these
rules.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
oh,
it's
more
than
that
your
honor
because
cleary
saw
the
--
cleary
saw
the
tape
recording
machine.
you
don't
have
to
have
the
tape
recording
machine
present
at
a
criminal
prosecution
to
convict
a
defendant
provided
to
have
evidence.
the
fact
that
they
don't
have
the
tape
recording
machine
isn't
going
to
prevent
a
conviction
assuming
that
they
could
have
sufficient
legal
evidence
to
establish
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
well,
that's
what
they
say
in
their
--
in
the
opinion.
but
i
think
you
can
go
further,
it
goes
further
because
if
i
view
of
something,
i
can
testify
that
i
observe
this,
i
observed
this
machine,
i
looked
at
it
and
i
saw
certain
numbers
on
them.
now
that
evidence
would
be
a
link
in
the
chain
of
evidence
that
could
be
adduced.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
oh
yes,
it
was.
because
then
cleary
--
all
they'd
have
to
do
i
believe
would
be
to
establish
the
corpus,
the
link
that
i
was
--
which
would
be
that
they
own
the
machine.
they
didn't
give
anybody
permission
to
take
it
and
it
was
taken.
and
then
cleary
had
testified,
“i
saw
that
machine.”
mr.
joseph
aronstein
to
getting
a
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
well,
now
you're
asking
me
to
answer
the
question.
i
don't
know
what
evidence
is
in
the
possession
of
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
county.
they
don't
tell
me
what
evidence
they
have.
i
have
to
wait
for
trial
so
i
don't
know
what
other
evidence
they
had
in
addition
to
this
evidence.
all
i
know
is
that
bolger
is
charged
for
further
time
with
petit
larceny
and
the
charge
having
been
reduced
from
grand
larceny.
now
the
district
attorney
doesn't
tell
me
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
well,
even
the
--
even
the
making
of
the
charge
against
him,
your
honor,
resulted
in
the
temporary
lifting
of
his
license
so
that
now,
bolger
has
been
deprived
of
work
since
i
believe
february
of
1960,
unable
to
get
work
in
the
waterfront
which
was
the
only
work
he
could
do.
he
spent
frankly
his
entire
life
working
as
a
longshoreman.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
they've
lifted
the
--
by
a
temporary
suspension.
he's
been
out
of
work
since
february
of
1960
i
believe
which
was
several
months
after
he
was
arrested
on
the
charge
because
he
was
taken
right
off
the
job.
he
has
been
working
even
after
he
was
arrested
on
that
charge.
he
has
lost
his
job
as
hiring
boss
but
he
is
working
as
a
longshoreman
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
they
come
along
and
says,
“you're
out
of
work,
give
me
your
pass,
its
temporary
lifted
by
an
order
of
the
waterfront
commission”.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
aronstein
yes
it
is
because
then
i'm
going
to
move
for
a
dismissal
of
the
charges
or
either
of
--
from
trial.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
on
--
not
on
the
indictment
but
on
the
proceedings.
after
all,
we're
entitled
to
a
speedy
trial.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
point
of
the
second
point
of
my
opponent's
petition
and
that
is
that
this
injunction
is
stopping
the
state
of
new
york
from
proceeding
with
this
trial,
stopping
the
waterfront
commission
from
proceeding
with
the
trial,
well,
that
isn't
the
fact
at
all.
there's
no
injunction
against
a
state
criminal
proceeding.
there's
no
injunction
against
the
waterfront
proceeding.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
of
course
not.
the
injunction
only
enjoined
him
of
testifying
with
respect
to
the
alleged
admissions
or
confessions
made
by
bolger
or
with
respect
to
producing
any
of
the
evidence
illegally
secured
by
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
the
customs
agent.
so
when
my
opponent
said
that
cleary
is
a
very
important
witness
and
that
as
a
result
of
him
being
enjoined,
the
state
cannot
proceed
--
what
if
--
well,
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
just
now.
i
say,
that's
an
assumption
on
his
part
that's
unwarranted
from
any
evidence
in
this
case
at
all.
the
district
attorney
of
new
york
county
is
the
one
who
is
charged
with
prosecuting
crimes
and
he
is
the
one
who
decides
how
important
or
unimportant
anybody's
--
any
witnesses'
testimony
is.
and
nowhere
in
this
proceeding
from
the
variant
section
as
the
district
attorney
come
in
and
asked
to
be
made
a
party
and
said
that
i'm
being
stopped
from
prosecuting
this
case
because
of
this
injunction.
and
therefore,
i
don't
think
that
this
question
is
properly
before
this
court,
and
the
fact
that
this
state
prosecution
is
being
stopped
because,
as
i
point
out
my
brief,
the
law
charges
the
district
attorney
with
prosecuting
all
criminal
indictments
or
charges.
and
it's
always
been
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
not
only
from
a
theory
but
some
practical
purposes
in
my
experience
that
it's
the
district
attorney
decides
who
is
dispensable
and
who
is
indispensable
as
a
witness.
so
the
fact
that
my
opponent
alleges
that
this
injunction
is
stopping
the
district
attorney
from
proceeding
with
this
prosecution,
that
is
not
so
at
all.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
well,
pardon
me,
i
don't
quite
understand.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
no,
it
wouldn't.
because
i
believe
that
the
question
of
whether
a
person
has
secured
evidence
illegally
is
of
far
greater
importance
in
the
question
of
whether
a
case
is
going
to
be
prosecuted
or
not
because
that
involves
not
only
the
constitutional
rights
but
it
also
involves
a
violation
of
the
federal
rules
which
are
--
have
the
same
force
of
statute.
now
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
the
illegal
--
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
of
this
property.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
oh,
no,
it
is
in
fact
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
well,
i
would
object
to
the
testimony
on
the
ground
that
the
evidence
with
respect
that
the
tape
recorder
was
secured
by
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
oh,
no.
that's
the
subject
matter
of
the
larceny
case.
in
the
state
prosecution,
the
tape
recorder
is
solely
the
subject
matter
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
that
is
the
--
that
is
what
the
larceny
charge
is
based
on.
the
larceny
of
a
tape
recorder
valued
at
a
hundred
dollars
or
less.
they
reduced
it
to
petit
larceny
from
grand
larceny.
and
that
prosecution
is
pending
now
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
well,
of
course
it--
oh,
wait,
i
may
be
wrong
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
--
on
that.
but
it's
not
necessary
to
have
the
tape
recorder
there.
they
could
prove
that
corpus
delicti
without
even
producing
the
tape
recorder.
the
company
can
show
that
they
purchased
this
tape
recorder,
that
they
ordered
it,
it
was
shipped
here
and
it
was
delivered
at
pier
so
and
so
in
new
york
and
that
they
discovered
that
the
cartons
were
empty
and
the
tape
recorder
was
missing.
and
they
gave
nobody
permission
to
take
it.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
pardon
me
your
honor?
mr.
joseph
aronstein
no,
he
did
not.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
well,
certainly
they
could
have
lifted
the
injunction.
cleary
can
testify
as
to
the
converse
--
as
to
the
confession
made
by
bolger.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
that's
true.
those
are
confessions
made
but
those
confessions
violate
the
fifth
amendment.
if
the
original
search
and
seizure
was
illegal
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
law
that
under
the
fifth
amendment,
any
confessions
made
--
obtained
are
illegal
also
because
they
are
the
fruits
of
the
poisonous
tree.
they
flow
directly
from
the
result
of
the
illegal
search
and
seizure.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
pardon
me
sir.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
well,
that
would
depend
on
some
other
factors
your
honor.
that
would
depend
on
the
fact
as
to
whether
the
arrest
was
illegal
arrest
or
not.
if
it
was
an
illegal
arrest
then
of
course
any
confessions
or
statements
made
would
become
illegal
because
of
the
fact
of
the
illegal
arrest.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
no,
but
it's
in
the
record
--
it's
in
the
record
in
the
circuit
court,
isn't
it
in
the
printed
record
in
the
circuit
court?
mr.
joseph
aronstein
i
know
(voice
overlap)
--
i
know
that
he
can.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
from
the
proceedings
had
in
the
lower
courts,
yes.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
i
don't
believe
so
except
that
the
statement
in
the
opinions
of
the
--
of
judge
bryan
and
the
circuit
court.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
i'd
make
that
assertion
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
--
i'm
sure
the
court
wouldn't
go
along
with
me.
that's
for
all
the
court
anyway.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
(inaudible)
yes,
as
a
constitutional
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
oh,
that
is
why
i
have
so
many
appeals
right
now
your
honor
in
the
state
courts.
and
i
know
that
from
my
practical
experience,
i
happen
to
do
trial
work
and
appellate
work.
i
could
cite
court
of
appeals
cases
and
i
don't
know.
they
just
say
motion
denied,
defendant
is
found
guilty
and
so
therefore
i
have
to
appeal.
and
i
have
succeeded
on
appeal
on
reversing
the
lower
courts
but
from
my
experience
the
lower
courts
--
the
constitutional
questions
and
even
questions
with
respect
to
evidence.
very
difficult
to
put
across
to
these
lower
court
judges
despite
the
fact
that
you
may
file
on
memorandum
citing
authorities
which
i
assume
they
are
bound
to
follow
whether
they
like
it
or
not,
that's
the
law,
that's
what
i've
been
taught
at
law
school
anyway.
and
as
a
result,
i
--
has
of
great
many
appeals
now
pending
involving
constitutional
questions
about
illegal
search
and
seizure.
now
my
friend
said
that
this
question
should
be
presented
in
the
state
courts
and
that
i
should
raise
the
question
and
as
decided
adversely,
i
should
take
an
appeal.
that's
a
very
nice
talk.
but
when
you
consider
that
new
york
state,
the
right
to
be
released
on
bail,
pending
the
termination
of
an
appeal
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
not
a
matter
of
right,
by
the
time
i
could
come
up
to
this
court
if
i
ever
got
this
far,
could
apply
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
the
answer
to
this
court
would
be
the
question
is
now
moot.
he
has
served
his
sentence.
and
therefore
the
court
wouldn't
consider
it.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
well,
judge
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
oh,
the
--
within
the
discretion
of
the
waterfront
commission,
maybe
5,
10
or
20
years
later,
they
might
reconsider
and
--
mr.
joseph
aronstein
pardon
me?
mr.
joseph
aronstein
well,
i'm
practicing
40
years
and
this
is
the
first
time
i've
been
here.
and
i
must
say
i've
tried.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
$25
fee
became
mold,
mildewed,
i
have
it
in
the
envelope,
you
know,
waiting
to
be
admitted.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
oh,
i
like
the
man
on
his
hotel,
it
is
surely
courtesy
of
the
court.
well,
i
believe
i
have
covered
the
question.
to
me
--
to
my
way
of
thinking
rather,
the
question
as
it
has
been
resolved
both
by
judge
bryan
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
opinion
has
disposed
of
this
and
i
believe
that
number
one,
beginning
about
mapp
against
ohio
when
bol
--
when
cleary
joined
this
unholy
alliance
of
the
customs
officers,
he
became
a
federal
officer
and
he
was
amenable
to
the
federal
rules
and
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
it
brings
to
my
mind
the
line
of
cases
where
i
distinctly
recall
a
new
york
city
police
officer
acting
solely
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
government
come
in
to
the
federal
court
with
the
case,
the
fact
that
the
new
york
city
police
officer
didn't
make
any
difference.
they
are
bound
by
constitutional
provisions.
they
are
bound
by
the
federal
rules.
though
i
say,
that
there's
no
question
that
cleary
for
the
purpose
of
this
case
became
a
federal
agent
and
that
is
what
in
the
essence
or
in
effect
the
opinions
of
the
lower
courts
hold.
and
so
far
as
the
second
point
of
the
prosecutions
here
delayed,
in
my
brief,
i
state
very
clearly,
very
carefully
that
they
could
proceed
any
time
they
want
with
the
prosecution.
i
have
gone
in
to
the
formal
court
special
sessions
in
new
york
county
which
is
now
the
criminal
court
because
i
have
demanded
a
trial
that
this
case
had
been
on
29
or
34
times
now
and
i'm
on
a
trial
and
the
district
attorney
said,
“well,
we're
not
ready
and
under
my
objection
the
court
has
adjourned
the
case
again”.
of
course
we
have
a
case
in
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
called
prosser
against
the
united
states
where
i
suppose,
i
could
ultimately
claim
that
i
haven't
been
given
a
speedy
trial
and
therefore
move
for
a
dismissal
of
the
information.
but
they
might
say
to
me,
but
it's
your
fault,
you've
got
the
injunction.
but
that's
the
way
the
situation
is
now.
i
say
to
this
court
with
all
(inaudible)
that
the
waterfront
commission
could
have
proceeded
with
their
hearing.
the
state
courts
would
have
proceeded
with
their
hearing
and
we're
ready
to
go
ahead.
the
fact
that
they
may
not
have
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
the
defendant
in
that
proceeding
or
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
finding
that
they
can
lift
his
waterfront
privileges
and
they'll
form
a
line.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
oh
yes,
because
in
their
allegations,
they
not
only
put
the
tape
recorder
in
but
it's
my
recollection
that
they
put
in
every
article
that
they
took
from
bolger's
house,
every
article
that
they
removed
from
bolger's
house.
of
course
the
subject
matter
in
the
state
court
is
only
the
tape
recorder.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
oh
yes.
mr.
joseph
aronstein
yes,
they
could
do
it
for
conduct
which
in
their
belief
is
sufficient
to
undermine
the
morale
of
the
arrest
of
the
longshoreman.
they
have
a
very,
very
broad
policy,
too
broad
i
think,
they
and
the
parole
board
of
the
state
of
new
york,
in
other
words.
thank
you
very
much.
