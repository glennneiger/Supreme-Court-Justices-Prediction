mr.
irving
malchman
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
upon
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
which
was
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
enjoins
the
petitioner
who
is
an
investigator
for
the
waterfront
commission
of
new
york
harbor
and
who
was
therefore
a
state
officer
from
testifying
or
producing
any
evidence
against
the
respondent
bolger
in
one,
a
state
criminal
prosecution
by
new
york
against
bolger
for
petty
larceny
and
in
two,
proceedings
by
the
waterfront
commission
to
revoke
bolger's
license
as
the
hiring
agent
and
to
revoke
bolger's
registration
as
a
longshoreman.
as
shall
appear,
bolger
has
no
--
rather
petitioner
has
no
evidence
to
produce
against
bolger
therefore
the
only
part
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case
is
that
part
of
the
order
enjoining
the
petitioner
from
testifying
against
bolger.
both
new
york's
criminal
prosecution
and
the
commission's
revocation
proceedings
had
been
instituted
and
were
pending
at
the
time
that
the
present
action
was
commenced
in
the
district
court.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
contained
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
which
was
rendered
after
a
trial.
on
a
saturday
morning
in
september
1959,
when
the
piers
along
the
new
york
waterfront
are
not
normally
being
worked,
certain
customs
officers
were
watching
certain
piers
along
the
hudson
or
north
river
in
manhattan
on
the
lookout
for
thefts.
at
about
8
o'clock
that
morning,
these
customs
officers
saw
bolger
enter
a
deserted
pier,
take
from
the
pier
a
cardboard
carton
and
placed
the
carton
in
a
car,
in
bolger's
car,
that
have
been
parked
in
front
of
the
pier.
the
customs
officers
searched
bolger
in
the
car
and
they
found
some
sparkplugs
and
some
windshield
wipers
stamped
marked
in
eng
--
stamped
“made
in
england”.
also,
bolger
told
the
customs
officers
that
he
had
some
liquor
at
home
that
he
had
obtained
from
the
ship's
crew.
the
customs
officers
took
bolger
into
custody
and
they
took
him
to
an
office
of
customs
in
manhattan.
at
the
office
of
customs,
bolger
told
the
customs
officers
that
he
had
some
merchandise
at
home
including
some
liquor
that
he
had
obtained
from
seamen
according
to
him.
bolger's
home
was
in
keansburg,
new
jersey
about
an
hours
drive
from
manhattan.
bolger
signed
a
written
consent
to
a
search
of
his
home
by
the
customs
officers
which
however
the
district
court
found
to
be
invalid
because
bolger
had
not
freely
and
intelligently
signed
the
consent
in
that
the
customs
officers
had
misrepresented
to
bolger
that
they
could
sign
his
--
that
they
could
search
his
house
without
his
consent.
at
about
11
o'clock,
the
customs
officers
left
with
bolger
or
bolger's
home
in
keansburg,
new
jersey.
in
this
connection,
the
district
court
found
that
the
united
states
commissioner
was
in
attendance
nearby
in
the
united
states
courthouse
in
foley
square
from
11
a.m.
to
1
p.m.
the
customs
officers
search
bolger's
home
for
about
two
hours
and
they
turned
up
some
apparently
contraband
merchandise
including
a
stenorette
tape
recorder
that
had
been
manufactured
in
west
germany.
the
customs
officers
returned
with
bolger
to
the
office
of
customs
in
manhattan
taking
back
with
them
this
apparently
contraband
merchandise.
it
will
be
noted
that
the
petitioner
was
not
present
here
and
therefore
did
not
participate
in
any
of
these
events.
however,
customs
works
in
close
cooperation
with
the
waterfront
commission
and
customs
had
notified
the
commission
of
the
fact
of
bolger's
detention
so
that
upon
bolger's
return
from
his
home
in
keansburg,
new
jersey
the
petitioner
was
present
at
the
office
of
customs.
the
petitioner
ascertained
that
bolger
had
a
key
to
a
basement
room
in
an
apartment
in
manhattan
which
bolger
said
that
he
used
as
a
tool
room
to
repair
pier
equipment.
the
petitioner
decided
to
investigate
this
story
and
he
--
a
customs
officer
and
bolger
drove
to
this
basement
room
which
was
searched.
however,
nothing
of
any
incrimination
--
of
any
incriminating
nature
was
turned
up
in
this
search
and
therefore
this
search
of
the
basement
tool
room
is
not
a
factor
in
the
case.
the
petitioner
returned
with
bolger
to
the
office
of
customs
at
about
5:45
p.m.
mr.
irving
malchman
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
is
the
record
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
malchman
the
district
court
found
that
the
customs
had
notified
the
waterfront
commission
of
the
fact
of
bolger's
detention.
when
bolger
returned
with
petitioner
to
the
office
of
the
customs,
the
customs
officers
asked
bolger
whether
he
would
make
a
statement
with
respect
to
the
merchandise
that
have
been
taken
from
his
home
by
the
customs
officers
and
apparently
bolger
did
not
object.
the
customs
officers
thereupon
took
a
statement
from
bolger
before
a
customs
shorthand
reporter.
although,
the
petitioner
was
present
during
the
taking
of
this
statement,
he
did
not
participate
in
it
in
any
way.
the
customs
officers
concluded
their
questioning
in
about
7
p.m.
and
released
bolger
at
about
7:20
p.m.
about
a
month
later,
in
october
1959,
the
new
york
city
police
arrested
bolger
upon
a
charge
of
larceny
based
upon
the
alleged
theft
of
the
stenorette
tape
recorder.
as
a
result
of
this
criminal
charges
by
the
state
of
new
york,
the
commission
instituted
proceedings,
its
proceedings
to
revoke
bolger's
license
as
a
hiring
agent
and
his
registration
as
a
longshoreman.
thereupon,
bolger
instituted
the
present
action
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
found
that
the
customs
officers
had
illegally
detained
bolger
after
11
a.m.
in
violation
of
rule
5
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
the
customs
officers
had
illegally
searched
bolger's
home
in
violation
of
rule
41
(a)
of
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
and
that
as
a
result
of
both
the
illegal
detention
and
the
illegal
search
and
seizure,
bolger
gave
a
highly
incriminating
statement
with
respect
to
the
merchandise
that
had
been
taken
from
his
home
before
the
customs
shorthand
reporter.
based
upon
these
determinations,
the
district
court
enjoined
the
customs
officers
from
testifying
or
producing
any
evidence
against
bolger
in
the
state
proceedings
against
him.
the
district
court
also
enjoined
the
petitioner
from
testifying
or
producing
any
evidence
against
bolger
upon
the
ground
that
such
an
injunction
was
necessary
in
order
to
effectuate
and
as
an
incident
to
the
injunction
against
the
customs
officers.
an
application
by
bolger
--
mr.
irving
malchman
it
does
both,
your
honor.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes,
sir.
the
district
court
denied
an
application
by
bolger
for
the
return
of
the
merchandise
that
had
been
taken
from
his
home
upon
the
ground
that
bolger
had
apparently
failed
to
establish
that
this
merchandise
were
not
--
was
not
contraband.
therefore,
the
merchandise
that
has
--
that
was
taken
from
bolger's
home
has
in
effect
been
frozen
in
the
custody
of
customs,
and
therefore,
the
petitioner
has
no
tangible
evidence
to
produce
against
bolger.
it
is
the
peti
--
petitioner's
contentions
first,
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
enjoining
him
from
--
mr.
irving
malchman
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
no,
sir.
the
order
of
the
district
court
in
this
case
specifically
--
mr.
irving
malchman
--
states
that
the
merchandise
--
mr.
irving
malchman
--
soon
--
mr.
irving
malchman
in
effect.
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
it
is
the
petitioner's
contentions
first
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
enjoining
him
from
testifying
against
bolger
in
new
york's
criminal
prosecution
and
in
the
commission's
revocation
proceedings
constitutes
an
improvident
exercise
of
federal
equitable
power.
it
is
also
the
petitioner's
contention
that
the
order
of
the
district
court
enjoining
him
from
testifying
in
new
york's
criminal
prosecution
is
prohibited
by
the
provisions
of
section
2283
of
the
judicial
code.
first,
the
contention
that
it
was
improvident
to
enjoin
the
petitioner
from
testifying
in
new
york's
criminal
prosecution;
this
injunction
is
contrary
to
the
applicable
decisions
of
this
court.
the
landmark
decision
in
this
area
is
the
decision
by
this
court
in
stefanelli
v.
minard.
in
stefanelli,
a
criminal
defendant
in
a
new
jersey
prosecution
brought
suit
in
the
district
court
under
the
civil
rights
act
to
enjoin
the
new
jersey
police
from
producing
certain
evidence
against
him
in
the
new
jersey
prosecution
which
allegedly
had
been
obtained
during
an
illegal
search
and
seizure.
this
court
in
the
stefanelli
case,
refused
to
decide
whether
the
complaints
stayed
as
a
cause
of
action
under
the
civil
rights
act.
instead,
this
court
said
that
the
issuance
of
such
an
injunction
would
result
in
an
insupportable
disruption
of
state
criminal
proceedings
and
this
court
enunciated
a
broad
principle
of
noninterference
with
state
criminal
proceedings.
there
are
two
other
decisions
by
this
court
in
this
area
which
refuse
injunctions
against
testimony
or
the
production
of
evidences
to
state
criminal
prosecutions.
in
pugach
v.
dollinger,
this
court
refused
to
enjoin
new
york
law
enforcement
officials
from
producing
new
york
wiretap
evidence
in
a
new
york
criminal
prosecution.
and
in
wilson
v.
schnettler,
decided
the
same
day
as
pugach,
this
court
refused
to
enjoin
this
time
a
federal
narcotics
agent
from
producing
narcotics
in
a
state
criminal
prosecution.
the
narcotics
agent,
that
is
the
federal
narcotics
agent,
had
arrested
the
state
criminal
defendant
without
a
warrant
and
had
found
narcotics
upon
the
defendant's
person.
however,
the
court
below,
that
is
the
second
circuit,
read
this
court's
decision
in
the
wilson
case
as
resting
solely
and
is
exclusively
upon
the
fact
that
the
complaint
in
the
wilson
case
did
not
allege
that
there
had
--
that
the
arrest
by
the
federal
narcotics
agent
had
been
made
without
probable
cause.
that
is
the
second
circuit
read
this
court's
opinion
in
the
wilson
case
as
resting
solely
and
exclusively
upon
the
defective
nature
of
the
complaint.
of
course,
if
this
were
so,
the
complaint
in
the
wilson
would've
been
dismissible
out
of
hand
in
the
single
paragraph
and
there
would've
been
no
need
for
this
court
to
discuss
and
to
distinguish
at
length
its
other
decisions
in
this
area
as
this
court
did
in
its
opinion
in
the
wilson
case.
further,
in
its
opinion
in
the
wilson
case,
this
court
plainly
and
specifically
stated
that
one
of
the
alternative
basis
--
bases
of
its
decision
not
to
enjoin
the
federal
narcotics
agent
was
the
principle
of
noninterference
enunciated
in
stefanelli.
this
brings
us
to
the
decision
by
this
court
in
rea
v.
united
states
which
is
the
only
case
where
this
court
has
sanctioned
an
injunction
against
testimony
or
the
production
of
evidence
in
state
criminal
prosecutions.
this
is
the
decision
which
the
court
below
relied
upon
and
this
is
the
decision
which
is
the
bone
of
contentions
in
this
case.
in
the
rea
case,
a
federal
narcotics
agent
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
which
had
been
defectively
issue
--
been
issued
in
violation
of
the
federal
rules
made
an
arrest
--
rather,
made
a
search
and
found
narcotics.
as
a
result
of
this
search
pursuant
to
this
defective
search
warrant,
a
federal
narcotics
prosecution
ensued.
and
in
this
federal
narcotics
prosecution
and
the
defendant
made
a
motion
in
the
district
court
to
suppress
the
seized
narcotics
which
was
granted
by
the
district
court.
in
the
rea
case,
this
court
said
in
its
opinion
with
respect
to
the
district
court's
order
of
suppression
that
under
28
u.s.c.
2463
which
was
applicable,
the
narcotics
“shall
not
be
repleviable,
but
shall
be
deemed
to
be
in
the
custody
of
the
law
and
subject
only
to
the
orders
and
decrees
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
having
jurisdiction
thereof”.
in
other
words,
this
court
itself
in
the
rea
case
specifically
pointed
out
that
the
order
of
suppression
therein
had
in
effect
an
in
rem
effect
with
respect
to
the
suppressed
narcotic.
notwithstanding
this
order
of
suppression
by
the
district
court,
the
federal
narcotics
agent
then
cause
a
state
narcotics
prosecution
to
be
instituted
against
the
same
person
who
was
the
defendant
in
the
federal
narcotics
prosecution.
thereupon,
the
defendant
moved
in
the
federal
district
court
for
an
order
enjoining
the
federal
narcotics
agent
from
testifying
or
producing
this
suppressed
narcotics
against
him
in
the
supre
--
in
the
state
prosecution.
this
court
held
that
such
an
injunction
should
issue.
with
respect
to
this
injunction,
this
court
stated
in
its
opinion
in
the
wilson
case
that
the
effect
of
the
suppression
order
in
the
rea
case
was
that
suppressed
property
“shall
not
be
admissible
in
evidence
at
any
hearing
or
trial”,
and
therefore,
the
motion
to
enjoin
in
the
rea
case
was
made
“to
prevent
the
thwarting
of
the
federal
suppression
order”.
in
other
words,
the
injunction
in
the
rea
case
rests
upon
a
single
of
set
of
book
facts
involving
the
integrity
of
a
district
court
order;
that
is
the
order
of
suppression.
the
rea
case
is
entirely
congruent
with
the
policy
of
noninterference
with
state
criminal
prosecutions
that
is
unmistakably
spelled
out
by
this
court
in
its
decisions
in
the
stefanelli
case,
the
pugach
case,
and
the
wilson
case.
the
argument
in
favor
of
a
federal
injunction
in
these
cases
runs
somewhat
as
follows
that
as
a
result
of
decisions
at
law
by
this
court,
the
evidence
in
question
is
clearly
admissible
that
therefore
there
is
no
adequate
remedy
of
law.
that
therefore
there
is
a
need
for
the
issuance
of
a
federal
injunction
to
protect
the
federal
rights
of
the
state
criminal
defendant.
under
this
argument,
result
is
had
in
effect
to
the
equity
side
of
this
court
in
order
to
overrule
or
circumvent
the
decisions
made
by
this
court
upon
its
law
side.
surely,
this
is
an
anomalous
procedure.
if
the
decisions
by
this
court
at
law
should
for
some
reason
no
longer
be
followed
or
if
they
should
for
some
reason
be
overruled,
then
this
should
be
direct
--
be
done
directly
and
forthrightly
at
law
and
upon
a
reconsideration
of
the
merits
and
not
as
here
by
a
flanking
attack
which
not
only
obscures
the
consideration
involved
in
the
merits
but
which
creates
a
needless
conflict
between
the
state
and
the
federal
courts.
beside,
it
is
not
even
clear
in
this
case
that
the
result
at
law
would
actually
be
adverse
to
the
respondent
bolger
here.
this
is
particularly
true
in
view
of
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
v.
ohio
holding
that
due
process
requires
the
exclusion
of
illegal
state
search
and
seizure
evidence
from
state
criminal
prosecutions.
the
court
below,
however,
thought
that
there
was
some
doubt
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
the
mapp
decision
to
this
case
and
therefore
thought
that
the
mapp
case
did
not
provide
inadequate
remedy
at
law.
however,
if
the
mere
uncertainty
of
the
result
at
law
as
opposed
to
and
if
a
conclusively
established
adverse
result
is
to
be
a
sufficient
basis
for
equitable
jurisdiction
then
the
basis
for
federal
piecemeal
interference
with
state
criminal
prosecutions
has
been
immeasurably
expanded.
it
will
mean,
for
example,
that
every
peripheral
question
in
this
area
in
every
variant
that
may
arise
under
the
mapp
case
may
be
permissibly
litigated
in
the
first
instance
that
by
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
the
state
courts
to
the
federal
courts.
the
unsupportable
disruption
of
state
criminal
prosecutions
which
was
referred
to
by
this
court
in
the
stefanelli
case
has
become
a
harsh
reality
in
this
case.
both
new
york's
criminal
prosecution
and
the
commission's
revocation
proceedings
were
instituted
in
october
1959.
that
both
new
york's
criminal
prosecution
and
the
commission's
revocation
proceedings
have
been
required
to
mark
high
for
over
three
years
pending
the
outcome
of
this
litigation
which
is
essentially
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
the
federal
courts
to
the
state
courts.
mr.
irving
malchman
no,
sir.
the
question
--
mr.
irving
malchman
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
irving
malchman
yes.
the
only
question
before
this
court
--
mr.
irving
malchman
yes,
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
i'm
not
entirely
clear
myself.
i
think
that
judge
anderson
would've
voted
with
the
majority
except
for
this
court's
intervening
decision
in
the
mapp
case
--
mr.
irving
malchman
--
and
in
view
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
mapp
case
he
thought
that
the
matter
should
be
remanded
to
the
state
courts.
petitioner's
second
contention
--
mr.
irving
malchman
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
i
discussed
the
petitioner's
contention
that
it
is
an
improvident
exercise,
a
federal
equitable
power
to
enjoin
the
petitioner,
been
testifying
in
new
york's
criminal
prosecution
against
the
respondent,
bolger.
it
is
also
--
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
it
does.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir,
it's
an
administrative
hearing.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes,
that's
exactly
the
point
that
i
was
coming
to
that
there
are
explicit
provisions
--
in
other
words
--
i
was
next
going
to
say
that
it
is
also
improvident
to
enjoin
petitioner's
testimony
before
the
commission
particularly
were
there
are
specific
provisions
in
the
waterfront
commission
compact
providing
for
judicial
review
of
a
“final
decision
or
action”.
mr.
irving
malchman
it's
in
the
appropriate
state
court.
mr.
irving
malchman
depending
upon
where
the
action
was
brought,
depending
upon
the
residence
of
the
respondent
essentially.
mr.
irving
malchman
its
before
a
hearing
examiner
who
renders
proposed
findings
and
recommended
conclusions
of
law
which
then
goes
before
the
commission
who
makes
the
final
deter
--
which
makes
the
final
determinant
--
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
one
from
each
state.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
the
scope
of
judicial
review
is
similar
to
judicial
review
in
the
federal
administrative
agency
and
that
is
if
the
findings
are
supported
by
substantive
evidence
the
determination
will
be
affirmed.
mr.
irving
malchman
absolutely
sir.
the
respondent
--
mr.
irving
malchman
well,
the
respondent
claimed
that
it
was
in
violation
of
his
federal
rights
that
cleary's
testimony
that
if
it
were
received
by
the
commission,
violated
his
federal
rights,
he
could
--
if
the
commission
ruled
against
them,
he
could
take
that
contention
to
the
state
court
and
if
the
state
court
ruled
against
them
he
could
ultimately
come
to
this
court.
mr.
irving
malchman
well,
i
would
assume
that
the
--
bolger
would
contend
that
his
statement
after
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
came
within
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
brought
to
him.
mr.
irving
malchman
well,
it
would
be
--
he
would
claim
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
was
incorporated
into
the
--
mr.
irving
malchman
--
into
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
irving
malchman
well,
both
of
course
--
i
cannot
speak
for
him,
he
could
make
any
claim
that
he
--
being
appropriate,
he
could
claim
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
federal
rules
and
that
by
virtue
of
this
violation
of
the
federal
rules,
the
petitioner's
testimony
should
not
be
received.
now
the
commission
may
or
may
not
accept
that
contention
and
if
an
adverse
determination
were
made
against
bolger,
he
could
then
go
to
the
state
courts
which
may
or
may
not
accept
the
contention
and
if
assuming
an
adverse
determination
all
the
way
through,
he
could
then
come
to
this
court.
mr.
irving
malchman
well
--
mr.
irving
malchman
i
think
that's
a
question
which
should
be
determined
in
the
appropriate
manner
that
is
in
the
proceedings
at
law.
our
objection
--
our
contentions
does
not
essentially
go
to
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence.our
contention
goes
to
the
time
and
place
that
the
respondent
has
chosen
to
raise
this
question.
mr.
irving
malchman
no
sir,
i
do
not.
and
i
would
like
to
explain
why
i
believe
that.
the
claimed
inadequacy
of
the
remedy
of
law
is
that
once
the
petitioner
speaks
then
the
state
determination
cannot
--
will
not
be
reversed
by
this
court.
mr.
irving
malchman
(voice
overlap)
mr.
irving
malchman
well,
that
--
in
other
words,
that
by
virtue
of
prior
decisions
by
this
court
particularly
before
mapp
v.
ohio
that
the
evidence
and
the
question
was
admissible
that
therefore,
the
state
criminal
defendant
or
the
state
criminal
respondent
did
not
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
that
therefore,
it
followed
that
a
federal
injunction
was
necessary
if
the
defendant's
or
respondent's
federal
rights
were
to
be
protected.
now,
under
this
argument,
resort
in
effect
has
had
to
the
equity
side
of
this
court
in
order
to
circumvent
or
overrule
the
decisions
of
this
court
rendered
at
law
it
is
a
completely
anomalous
procedure.
our
contention
is
that
there's
nothing
magical
about
a
proceeding
in
equity
that
a
state
criminal
defendant
or
respondent
does
not
transmute
his
federal
rights
simply
by
becoming
a
plaintiff
in
equity
in
the
united
states
district
court
that
if
for
some
reason,
the
decisions
of
this
court
should
not
be
followed
or
it
goes
--
a
dissatisfaction
with
those
decisions
then
--
or
if
those
decisions
should
be
overruled,
this
should
be
done
directly
in
fort
riley
at
law
by
this
court
upon
a
reconsideration
of
the
merits.
but
this
court
should
not
allow
this
to
be
done
indirectly
by
a
flanking
attack
which
not
only
really
obscures
the
considerations
involved
in
the
merits
but
which
creates
a
needless
and
gratuitous
conflict
between
the
state
and
the
federal
courts.
mr.
irving
malchman
well,
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
v.
ohio,
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
which
is
the
highest
court
in
new
york
has
gone
further
than
this
court
has
gone
and
has
held
as
we
set
forth
in
our
reply
brief
that
even
an
omission
after
an
illegal
search
and
seizure
by
a
state
officer
that
is
an
omission
by
a
state
criminal
defendant,
comes
within
the
poisonous
tree
doctrine
and
therefore
is
inadmissible
under
mapp
v.
ohio.
mr.
irving
malchman
well,
this
would
be
the
case
your
honor.
this
would
be
--
i
don't
know
of
any
other
case
where
that
question
has
arisen.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
in
other
words,
what
we're
saying
is
that
there's
nothing
magical
about
a
suit
in
equity
that
there's
no
reason
why
this
defendant
--
mr.
irving
malchman
it
gets
--
it
would
get
here
on
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
irving
malchman
on
the
ground
that
his
federal
rights
had
been
violated
namely
that
the
testimony
had
been
obtained
in
violation
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
the
evidence
rather
had
been
maintained
in
violation
of
federal
rules
and
criminal
procedure
and
are
to
effectuate
the
policy
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
it
is
necessary
to
exclude
the
evidence.
mr.
irving
malchman
well,
insofar
as
the
federal
rule,
its
rule
41
(a),
i
have
difficult
--
which
is
--
relates
to
search
warrants.
there
are
two
federal
rules
involved
in
this
case,
one
is
the
rule
5
(a)
which
is
the
illegal
detention
and
one
is
rule
41
(a)
which
is
the
illegal
search
and
seizure.
i
don't
see
much
difference
between
rule
41
(a)
and
the
fourth
amendment
so
that
whatever
claim
--
mr.
irving
malchman
no
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes.
what
cleary
overheard
--
mr.
irving
malchman
--
of
bolger,
yes.
mr.
irving
malchman
yes
sir.
mr.
irving
malchman
a
violation
of
both
rules
5
(a)
and
--
mr.
irving
malchman
41
(a),
yes
sir.
41
(a)
is
--
i
can
see
no
difference
in
the
practical
matter
between
rule
41
(a)
and
the
fourth
amendment
so
that
he
would
have
the
constitutional
claim
with
respect
to
the
violation
of
rule
41
(a).
of
course,
there's
no
counterpart,
constitutional
provision
with
respect
to
rule
5
(a).
my
time
is
up.
