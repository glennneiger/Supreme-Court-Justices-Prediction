justice
byron
r.
white
where
in
the
record,
do
you
know
in
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that's
all
there
is.
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
tell
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
the
new
york
rule
is?
is
the
evidence
admissible?
is
it
--
has
obtained
by
a
state
officer
in
violation
of
the
federal
rule
or
federal
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
the
question
i
asked,
i
mean
the
mapp
--
there
is
a
constitutional
issue
involved,
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
right
involved
here.
my
question
was
the
--
if
the
violation
by
the
state
officer
or
by
some
officer
to
whom
he
gets
this
information,
a
violation
of
a
federal
statute
or
a
federal
rule
or
procedure.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
--
this
is
really
an
unsettled
question
in
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
new
york
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
admissibility
of
this
evidence.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
contend
that
if
that
question
were
ruled
upon,
adversely
to
the
defendant
in
the
criminal
proceedings
in
the
new
york
courts
that
that
question
could
be
reviewed
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
--
that
isn't
really
the
question.
the
question
is
how
did
the
--
when
the
criminal
proceeding
is
over
and
the
man
had
been
convicted,
how
does
the
case
get
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
--
alleging
on
what
ground
within
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
serious
--
does
that
have
a
serious
consequences
for
bolger,
is
that
his
name,
as
the
possible
lifting
of
his
license
to
work
on
the
docks?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cleary
has
got
anything
to
do
with
that?
he
wasn't
on
the
--
he
didn't
go
out
from
the
search
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
he
go
on
the
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
cleary's
testimony
--
they
couldn't
prove
the
tape
recorder
is
with
cleary,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
those
are
statements
and
it
isn't
the
--
it
isn't
the
property
obtained
as
a
result
of
illegal
search
and
seizure,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
statements
before
that
are
alright?
justice
byron
r.
white
statements
before
the
search
are
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
we
know
what
cleary
heard?
is
that
in
the
record
what
he
heard
or
what
he
could
testify
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
we
know
that
he
knows
that
he
could
testify
as
to
anything
about
the
tape
recorder?
or
we
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
know
that
he
can
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
there
a
record
here
of
what
he
--
actually
could
or
would
testify
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
the
court
go
along
with
you?
i
thought
the
new
york
courts
have
held
that
--
