(inaudible)
through
the
customs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
not
available
to
commission
or
to
bolger,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
impounds
it,
is
that,
so
that
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
malchman,
may
i
ask
you?
is
this
injunction
restraining
bolger
from
testifying
at
the
proceedings
before
the
waterfront
commission
which
goes
to
the
suspension
or
the
revocation
of
the
privileges?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
is
that
decision?
is
that
an
administrative
procedure
of
some
kind
before
the
commission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
administrative
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
a
judicial
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
review
i
take
it
is
at
what,
in
the
new
york
state
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
it
could
be
in
new
jersey
or
new
york
depending
upon
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
an
administrative
hearing,
is
this
before
a
hearing
examiner
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
commission
was
a
two-member
commission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
two-member
commission.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
from
each
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
it
makes
the
decision,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
the
scope
of
judicial
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now,
suppose
the
injunction
were
lifted,
could
the
contention
made
be
raised
as
a
federal
question
before
the
hearing
examiner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
it
be
a
federal
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is
not
as
a
federal
--
or
is
it
or
is
it
the
federal
claim
a
constitutional
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
as
a
fruit
of
poisonous
tree
for
a
violation
of
any
constitutional
provision
which
is
the
fourth
amendment
or
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
it
would
depend
upon
a
claim
of
violation
of
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
it
would
be
sufficiently
a
federal
question
even
though
arrested
on
the
violation
of
his
federal
criminal
rule
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
that
went
on
to
the
constitution.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
think
it
bears
on
whether
he
has
an
adequate
remedy
at
the
law
in
the
state
courts
whether
or
not
the
question
is
when
he'd
have
to
assert
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
rather
than
under
the
constitution?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
reviewable
or
not
reverse
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
not
reviewable
by
this
court,
is
that
the
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there's
nothing
about
mapp
is
there
which
would
require
the
new
york
courts
to
exclude
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
or
is
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understood
what
you
said
yesterday
that
stenorette,
whatever
the
name
of
that
is,
that
recording
machine,
we're
not
concerned
with
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
the
subject
of
the
search
and
seizure,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
we're
dealing
with
here
as
i
understood
it
was,
whatever
bolger,
is
that
his
name?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
have
overheard
in
the
interrogation
of
cleary
by
the
customs
officer.
that's
what
we're
concerned
with
here
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
that
--
well,
whatever,
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
--
was
not
the
rationale
below
that
it
was
the
violation
of
rule
5
which
required
the
exclusion
in
any
federal
proceeding
of
anything
either
that
the
state
officer
of
the
federal
officer
has
heard?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
also,
the
violation
of
that
rule
which
required
the
injunction
against
the
state
officer
testifying
in
any
state
proceeding,
wasn't
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
5
and
41?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
aronstein,
have
you
any
comment
about
the
suggestion
judge
anderson
made
at
page
23
in
effect
that
mapp
makes
clear
that
the
state
courts
are
bound
to
protect
bolger
against
the
violation
of
rule
5
(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
pendency
of
the
larceny
indictment
is
enough?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
sustaining
this
injunction
is
not
going
to
leave
that
situation,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
sustaining
this
injunction,
if
we
sustain
this
injunction,
that
situation
is
not
going
to
be
relieved,
i
take
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
the
indictment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
right
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
that
was
out
of
the
case,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
were
to
lift
this
injunction
and
they
would
have
produced
--
why
is
it
i
have
this
name
confused
--
cleary.
if
they
would
have
produced
cleary
say,
before
the
hearing
examiner
on
the
proceeding
before
the
commission,
you
would
object
to
his
testimony
on
what
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
thought
the
tape
recorder
was
out
of
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
with
lifting
this
in
--
that
the
tape
recorder
is
presently
impounded,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
would
lifting
this
injunction
release
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
the
state
said
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
point
is
mr.
aronstein
that
if
in
the
state
criminal
proceeding,
cleary
would
have
testified
that
he
heard
bolger
say
that
he,
bolger
had
stolen
the
tape
recorder
that
you'd
object
to
the
admissibility
of
that
testimony
on
the
ground
that
they
know
nothing
about
the
tape
recorder
but
for
the
illegal
search
and
seizure
at
the
home
of
bolger.
and
therefore,
that
the
statement
overheard
as
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
and
so
forth,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
constitutional
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
if
you
do
it
--
you
do
that
what,
as
a
constitutional
argument?
