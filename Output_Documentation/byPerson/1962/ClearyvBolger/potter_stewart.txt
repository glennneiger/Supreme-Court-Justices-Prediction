well,
that
certain
--
that
wouldn't
be
moot,
would
it,
if
he

that
would
last
if
i
gather,
how
long
does
that
last
if
you
--
if
a
license
is
lifted
in
a
case
like
this?
justice

stewart
it
wouldn't
take
you
5,
10
or
20
years
to
get
here
wouldn't
it?

incidentally,
does
the
lifting
of
the
license
depend
upon
a
conviction
under
the
information
or
independently
of
a
conviction
even
an
acquittal
under
the
information,
might
they
still
would
be
able
to
lift
the
license?
justice

but
may
the
waterfront
commission
lift
the
license
without
--
except
on
the
basis
of
an
actual
conviction
of
a
crime?
justice
potter
stewart
it
may?
