what
does
that
injunction
do,
enjoin

before
the
commission
or
in
the
state
court
proceeding?
justice
john
m.
harlan
both?
justice
john
m.
harlan
are
the
merits
of
judge
bryan's
order
in
suppressing
this
evidence
before
us?
justice
john
m.
harlan
simply
the
injunction
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
by
the
injunction?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
did
judge
anderson
mean
when
he
--
when
his
des
--
he
dissented,
as
i
understand
it
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
said
he
agreed
with
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
the
affirmance
of
judge
bryan's
order
or
somewhere
as
to
that
effect.
what
it
--
wouldn't
that
--
what
does
that
mean?
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
that
the
way
you
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
this
record
show
anything
that
the
federal
officers
did
that
was
done
at
the
request
of
mr.--
of
cleary
or
was
he
just
a
passive
acquiescent
observer,
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
whether
the
federal
officers
did
something
to
bolger
at
the
request
of
cleary.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'm
just
asking.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes,
but
you
put
the
word
conspiracy
in
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
your
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
is
it
your
view
that
if
cleary
had
happened
to
stumble
in
there
on
this
episode,
had
no
req
--
no
information,
he
just
happened
to
stumble
in,
did
he
have
to
walk
away?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
understand
that.
justice
john
m.
harlan
on
the
assumption
that
it
had.
do
you
think
that
would
make
any
difference
to
your
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
assumption,
on
the
assumption
that
the
injunction
did
prevent
the
state
from
proceeding
because
this
man's
testimony
was
necessary,
would
that
have
any
bearing
on
your
case?
