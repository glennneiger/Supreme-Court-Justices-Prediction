mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
mr.
chief
justice,
gentlemen
of
this
court.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
from
--
on
appeal
from
two
judgments
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
kansas
in
which
there
were
affirmed
two
orders
of
the
state
corporation
commission
of
that
state,
one
dated
october
9th,
1959
and
the
other
dated
february
3rd,
but
effective
february
8th,
1960.
the
first
order
complained
of
was
directed
to
northern
natural
gas
company
alone.
the
second
order
was
directed
to
all
purchasers
of
gas.
each
order
requested
or
required
that
the
pipeline
purchasing
company
purchase
gas
ratably
from
all
of
the
wells
connected
to
its
system
in
the
first
instance
and
the
testimony
in
the
case
related
solely
to
the,
what
is
known
as
the
kansas
hugoton
gas
field,
although
of
course
there
are
other
gas
fields
in
kansas.
the
real
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
orders
and
rule
here
under
appeal
which
on
their
face
and
in
their
intended
operative
effect
regulates
sales
of
gas
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
are
valid
in
view
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
rules
and
the
regulations
of
the
federal
power
commission
promulgated
pursuant
thereto.
northern
natural
gas
company
is
a
corporation
engaged
in
the
business
of
purchasing
and
transporting
natural
gas
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale,
for
ultimate
public
consumption,
and
is
therefore
a
natural
gas
company
as
defined
in
the
natural
gas
act.
the
hugoton
gas
field
is
a
rather
large
gas
field.
attached
to
the
first
memorandum
that
was
filed
in
this
matter
in
behalf
of
the
federal
power
commission,
you
will
find
a
plat
that
relates
to
the
portion
of
the
hugoton
field
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
in
the
first
memorandum
filed
in
behalf
of
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes,
your
honor.
this
plat
shows
the
general
outline
of
the
portion
of
the
hugoton
gas
field
that
is
in
kansas.
other
portion
of
this
gas
field
extends
on
through
oklahoma,
principally
texas
county,
oklahoma,
and
then
another
portion
is
located
in
the
state
of
texas.
of
course,
each
portion
of
this
great
gas
field
is
supervised
by
--
as
to
production
by
the
state
regulatory
agency
of
the
particular
state
in
which
that
portion
is
located.
in
1930,
northern
natural
gas
company
began
to
purchase
gas
in
the
kansas
hugoton
gas
field.
one
of
its
two
principal
purchase
contracts
in
that
field
was
made
in
1930
by
the
predecessor
companies
of
what
is
now
northern
natural
gas
company
as
purchaser
and
republic
natural
gas
company
as
seller.
in
this
particular
record,
the
supplementary
or
amended
contract
which
was
made
in
1945
is
made
a
part
of
the
record.
for
convenience
sake,
it
is
referred
to
as
the
republic
“a”
contract
because
it
was
the
initial
contract
made
between
northern
as
purchaser
and
republic
“a”
as
seller.
some
eight
years
later,
northern
began
to
make
additional
purchase
contracts
for
gas
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
and
among
those
contracts,
there
are
--
there
is
another
republic
contract
so
to
differentiate
between
the
contracts,
we
call
the
first
one
republic
“a”
and
the
second
one,
the
republic
“b”
contracts.
in
this
first
or
the
republic
“a”
contract,
there
was
an
agreement
for
northern
to
purchase
or
pay
for,
in
other
words,
a
take
or
pay
for
provision
relating
to
a
maximum
as
well
as
a
minimum
volume
of
gas
during
each
contract
year.
each
and
all
of
the
other
gas
purchase
contracts
which
northern
has
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
required
northern
to
purchase
gas
from
the
connections
thereunder
ratably
as
between
the
wells
and
accepts
from
that
provision
and
that
requirement,
the
take
or
pay
for
obligations
under
the
republic
“a”
contract.
in
1952,
this
take
or
pay
for
provision
in
the
republic
“a”
contract
was
before
the
kansas
supreme
court
for
interpretation
with
respect
to
northern’s
obligations
in
view
of
the
basic
proration
order
which
was
in
effect
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
that’s
an
order
addressed
to
producers,
requiring
ratable
production
as
between
all
the
wells
in
the
field
and
in
that
proceeding,
the
kansas
supreme
court
interpreted
that
contract
as
to
require
northern
to
purchase
the
legal
allowables
assigned
to
the
republic
“a”
wells,
no
more
or
no
less.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
maybe
if
i
amplified
it
a
little
bit,
it'd
be
--
the
kansas
corporation
commission
in
1944
promulgated
what
they
call
the
basic
proration
order
for
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
under
the
provisions
of
that
order,
there
are
market
demand
hearings,
each
six
months,
and
a
market
demand
determination
made
for
the
succeeding
six
months,
october
1st
and
april
1st
--
i
believe
in
march,
i've
forgotten,
april
1st,
i
believe.
then
under
that
proration
order,
deliverability
tests
are
taken
of
all
the
wells
to
determine
in
effect
their
comparable
reserved
position.
then
on
that
deliverability
test,
that
market
demand
is
spread
over
all
the
wells
in
the
field.
now
this
is
a
very
large
field
so
there
is
--
there
are
provisions
giving
tolerance
with
respect
to
when
you
may
run
the
allowable
from
a
well.
the
field
is
some
80
miles
long
and
i
forgot
about
60
miles
wide,
something
like
that
in
kansas
alone.
so
it's
quite
a
job
to
maintain
ratable
production
as
between
the
wells.
you
also
have
the
problem
of
summer
valleys
in-year
demand
than
winter
peaks
in-year
demand
from
a
pipeline
situation.
with
the
result
that
the
basic
proration
order
gives
the
producer
a
tolerance
to
produce
sometime
during
the
year
up
to
six
times
the
january
allowable
assigned
to
the
well
or
it
may
go
down
to
six
times
under,
so
you
have
that
tolerance.
now
this
matter
went
to
the
kansas
supreme
court.
republic
contended,
that's
a
long
way
to
get
back
to
your
question
but
i
think
with
this
explanation,
it
would
be
a
little
more
understandable,
republic
contended
in
that
action
that
northern
was
required
to
purchase
under
this
contract
not
the
allowable
but
the
maximum
six
--
at
that
time
it's
three
times,
presently,
it's
six
times
january.
they
said,
“you've
got
to
produce
the
--
purchase
the
maximum
at
all
times
instead
of
what
we
call
the
zero
line,
the
allowable.”
and
the
court
said,
“no,
it's
what
is
the
allowable”,
in
other
words,
legal
allowable
that
is
assigned
to
those
wells.
now
there
are
about
143
wells
under
the
republic
“a”
contract.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
it's
in
the
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
the
original
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
the
basic
proration
order?
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
no,
your
honor,
not
to
this
court.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
not
to
this
court.
the
opinion
i
referred
to
is
the
kansas
supreme
court.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
there
--
there
--
northern
has
about
125
now
gas
purchase
contracts
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
in
all
connecting
to
northern
system
about
1100
wells.
there
are
about
4000
wells
in
all
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
now
in
--
from
the
time
of
the
inception
of
production
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field,
until
1944,
i
think
production
started
perhaps
in
1932
or
thereabouts.
in
1944
and
forward
for
the
next
eight
years,
the
facts
show
that
ratability
as
to
production
between
the
wells
in
the
field
was
pretty
well
maintained
bearing
in
mind
that
there
were
variations
in
it,
but
it
was
usually
brought
back
in
a
reasonable
time
to
what
i
referred
to
as
the
zero
line.
in
1958,
they
have
developed
a
material
difference
than
the
experience
that
--
which
had
occurred
before
in
this
regard.
in
the
first
place,
the
record
shows
that
there
were
two
reasons
for
this.
beginning
in
1956,
the
kansas
commission
departed
from
its
previous
practices
in
determining
market
demand
and
spreading
allowables.
now
the
validity
of
that
practice,
if
the
court
please,
is
not
here
in
this
case.
that
question
is
before
the
kansas
supreme
court
in
some
other
litigation,
but
as
a
result
of
that
practice
in
1958,
the
wells
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
carried
on
commission's
schedules
about
130
billion
cubic
feet
of
allowables
in
excess
of
the
production
from
the
field.
that
meant,
of
course,
that
if
northern
was
going
to
comply
with
the
republic
“a”
contract,
since
we
had
no
way
to
determine
until
the
court
determined
it,
whether
these
excessive,
as
we
say
allowables,
were
the
legal
allowables.
we
were
compelled
to
purchase
the
legal
allowable
or
the
allowables
fixed,
carried
on
the
commission
schedule
from
the
republic
“a”
wells.
now
that
meant
of
course
that
our
market
requirements
from
the
field
were
not
sufficient
for
us
to
take
the
legal
allowables
or
to
--
from
all
of
the
other
wells
because
more
of
it
was
soaked
up
and
went
to
the
republic
“a”
wells
then
was
available
for
the
other
wells.
so
that
beginning
in
1958,
there
was
a
departure
from
that
zero
line
as
between
the
purchasers
by
northern
from
the
republic
“a”
wells
and
its
purchasers
from
the
other
wells
to
which
it
was
connected
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
there
was
another
reason
that
the
record
shows
for
this
disparity
and
takes
or
purchasers
was
that
northern
had
purchased
additional
gas
supply
in
some
other
areas
believing
that
it
was
necessary
to
support
some
applications
for
additional
markets
and
the
proceedings
in
those
respects
before
the
federal
power
commission
got
bogged
down
and
there
was
this
unexpected
substantial
delay.
so
northern
was
contractually
bound
to
make
more
purchases
of
gas
from
other
fields
temporarily
than
it
had
expected
to
be
obligated
for.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
maybe
i've
misstated
myself
in
some
respect.
our
basic
contention
does
not
depend
upon
a
--
we
don't
think
it's
a
contract
question
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
oh,
definitely
it's
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
it's
one
of
the
end
results.
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
one
of
the
end
results.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
no,
that's
alright.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
it's
our
view
that
this
order
is
invalid
because
of
moving
over
into
the
state,
attempting
to
move
over
into
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
power
commission
with
respect
to
the
regulation
of
the
sales.
you
see,
all
of
these
orders
were
made
to
the
purchaser.
they
weren't
made
to
the
producer.
now,
if
i
got
your
question
correctly,
it
is
our
view
and
it
will
be
our
contention
that
if
this
--
if
these
complained
of
orders
are
valid
that
then
they
will
have
the
necessary
effect
of
modifying
the
take
or
pay
for
provision
in
the
republic
“a”
contract.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
i
think
that's
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
i
think
that's
correct.
in
other
words,
how
you
are
hurt,
except
for
going
through
quite
a
period
now
of
uncertainty
and
being
sued
for
a
lot
of
money
and
operating
in
a
vacuum,
but
i
--
we
feel
this
matter
goes
far
deeper
than
any
contracts
or
question
and
if
the
flood
gates
are
going
to
be
thrown
open
to
states
having
some
effect
on
sales
of
gas
in
interstate
commerce
that
the
whole
thing
can
--
even
though
they
maybe
mild,
you
might
say
in
some
instances,
that
it
becomes
a
mountain
after
a
while.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
your
honor,
we
do
not
question
whatever
the
right
of
the
state
to
regulate
sales
if
the
object
is
to
accomplish
ratable
production.
i
believe
as
we
review
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
will
be
apparent
that
the
object
here
was
not
a
legal
state
object.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
you
mean
from
one
state
to
another?
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
your
honor,
that's
not
--
that's
not
the
purpose
of
this
order.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
i'm
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
i'm
sorry
to
say
but
we
--
we
couldn't
tell
just
what
you
could
be
sure
was
the
interpretation
in
the
order
by
our
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
we're
--
we're
very
proud
of
our
court,
don't
misunderstand
me
but
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
quite
true.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well
of
course,
your
honor,
a
review
of
the
record
in
this
case
will
show
that
there's
one
thin
bit
of
evidence
of
one
witness
inferring
that
there
might
be
some
uncompensated
drainage.
they
use
by
way
of
illustration
to
prove
it.
i
believe
it
has
four
wells
if
i
recall
it
correctly,
two
of
which
were
in
texas
county,
oklahoma
and
two
of
which
were
up
in
the
west
end
of
the
field
in
kansas.
when
--
if
you
read
all
of
the
testimony
that's
in
the
record
with
respect
to
that,
i
think
a
fair
conclusion
is
that
there's
no
showing
of
uncompensated
drainage.
now
there's
no
--
there's
no
argument
or
no
question
at
all
about
that
there
is
a
lack
of
ratable
production
between
the
wells
on
northern
system
during
this
period
that's
here
in
controversy.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
the
wells
on
any
other
purchasing
companies
lined
or
as
to
the
ratability
of
production
of
those
wells.
this
whole
proceeding
was
slanted
against
northern
natural
gas
company
and
the
place
where
we
come
back
to
this
contract
question,
it
shows
the
very
purpose
behind
these
orders
was
to
compel
a
purchaser
which
here
happen
to
be
northern
to
purchase
more
gas
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field
than
it
was
previously
purchasing.
all
they
ever
set
out
to
do
here
and
they
so
stated
on
record,
page
9
and
i
read
it,
step
proposal
exhibit
1,
this
is
the
general
counsel
for
the
kansas
commission,
“it
is
not
intended
to
balance
the
production
of
wells
in
the
same
common
source
of
supply
regardless
of
--”
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
record
9,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
about
the
middle
of
the
page.
now,
regardless
of
which
pipeline
they're
connected
to,
it
merely
proposes
pipeline
proration.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
this
exhibit
attached
to
--
if
you
will
notice,
attached
to
the
federal
power
commission
memorandum,
the
first
that
i've
mentioned,
shows
in
colors
the
location
of
the
acreage
that
is
attached
to
the
lines
of
various
purchasers
and
the
legend
down
there
shows
the
colors
of
the
acreage
that
is
connected
to
particular
purchasing
companies.
now
pipeline
proration
means
ratability
in
purchases
or
production
--
pipeline
proration
ratability
in
purchasers
from
all
of
the
wells
that
are
connected,
for
instance,
to
northern
system.
that
particular
group
of
wells
would
participate
equally
in
northern's
market.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
it
makes
--
perhaps
it
makes
some
difference
that
i
start
to
say
it
makes
little
difference.
if
all
of
the
wells
connected
to
northern
system
produced
ratably
and
if
northern's
market
demand
from
the
field
was
not
--
i
mean,
if
you
do
not
spread
over
the
whole
field,
all
of
the
market
demand
of
the
various
purchasers,
that‘s
the
only
way
you
get
ratability
in
assignment
of
what
wells
may
produce.
you
can't
just
take
one
purchaser's
market
demand
and
assign
that
to
its
wells,
because
you
don't
get
--
you
don't
get
ratable
production
in
your
field.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
it
was
not
being
applied
at
all
until
--
the
first
order
here
was
in
october
9th,
1959,
that
was
addressed
to
northern
alone.
the
second
order
and
they
confess
on
the
record
that
they
were
afraid
their
first
order
was
invalid
because
it
was
addressed
to
northern
alone.
so
they
said
whatever
is
good
or
bad
enough
for
northern,
while
we'll
apply
to
other
purchasers
so
their
second
order
superseded
the
first
one
and
was
made
to
apply
to
all
purchasers.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
your
honor,
the
record
doesn't
show
here.
the
unfortunate
thing
is
you'd
have
to
try
these
cases
and
guess
what
the
order
is
going
to
be
and
then
your
record
doesn't
show
that
because
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes,
i
can
tell
you
that.
the
effect
is
that
northern
purchases
gas
as
all
pipelines
with
substantial
markets
and
you
purchase
gas
in
the
great
many
fields
in
a
great
many
states.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
pardon?
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
oh,
to
transport
in
interstate
commerce
for
your
markets.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
now,
the
steps
are
that
not
only
northern
with
respect
to
its
facilities,
but
the
producer
when
these
gas
purchase
contracts
are
made,
they
come
before
the
federal
power
commission,
both
the
northern's
application
for
certification
to
build
facilities,
but
also
the
producer
comes
in
for
his
certificate
to
approve
his
sale
and
service
of
this
gas.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
correct,
gentlemen.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
the
federal
power
commission,
of
course,
does
in
those
proceedings
determine
what
is
in
the
public
interest.
and
if
there
is
something
about
this
group
of
contracts,
it
can
condition
its
certificate
or
it
can
turn
them
down.
now
that
means
then
that
here
you've
got
commitments
under
contracts,
maybe
in
this
state,
maybe
in
this
state,
you
don't
have
commitments,
maybe
as
in
kansas,
northern
only
has
this
one
take
or
pay
for
contract.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
take
or
pay
for
--
the
republic
“a”
contract.
all
of
the
rest
of
them
do
not
have
that
provision
there.
now,
then
you
have
in
texas,
we'll
say
we
have
some
take
or
pay
for
contracts
there,
maybe
some
in
oklahoma
or
maybe
some
in
new
mexico.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
right.
now,
you
say
how
is
it
going
to
affect
northern
and
of
course,
if
it
affects
northern,
i
think
it
affects
its
consumers.
if
the
effect
of
--
if
the
intended
effect
of
these
complained
of
orders
is
accomplished,
you
have
the
take
or
pay
for
contract
here.
these
orders
do
not
bring
that
down
to
these
--
to
these
other
contracts.
these
orders
here
in
effect
bring
these
contracts
up.
in
other
words,
they
fix
a
floor.
we
still
have
to
take
the
allowables
under
the
republic
“a”
contract,
by
contract
i
mean.
now
they
say
if
you're
going
to
take
those
allowables,
you've
got
to
take
the
allowables
from
all
of
your
other
wells.
now,
that's
what
we
call
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
--
the
favored
nations
clause.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes
--
no,
in
kansas,
in
the
same
field.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
it's
an
agreement
to
purchase,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
there
were
two
ways.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
okay,
in
effect
--
in
effect,
they
read
into
all
of
the
124
contracts.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
with
different
producers.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
in
kansas,
in
the
hugoton
field,
they
read
into
it
by
these
orders
a
take
or
pay
for
provision
that
isn't
fair,
that
is
similar
to
the
take
or
pay
for
provision
in
the
republic
“a”
contracts.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes,
i
mean,
its
--
gas,
yes,
that's
right.
now,
there's
two
ways
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
your
honor,
it
is
the
fpc
that
determines
what's
in
the
public
interest
and
they
assert
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
and
they
certainly
can
modify
contracts.
and
they're
the
only
ones
i
think
that
can
under
the
law.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
what
the
kansas
court
said,
and
i
think
--
i
don't
believe
that
it's
correct.
they're
concerned
with
price
and
service.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
right.
what's
in
the
public
interest?
it's
the
federal
power
commission
that
determines
what
is
in
the
public
interest.
getting
back
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
have
gathered
--
fully
explained
it,
if
what
the
kansas
commission
wanted
to
do
here
was
to
accomplish
ratable
production
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
between
wells
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
it's
an
unfair
share.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
right.
now
i'm
talking
about
over
the
whole
field,
your
honor
and
that's
the
only
way
you'd
have,
ratable
production
is
over
the
whole
field.
if
they
want
to
accomplish
that,
the
witness
for
city
service
petroleum
company
which
was
sort
of
a
complaining
party
in
this
proceeding,
told
the
kansas
commission,
how
you
can
do
it.
“there
are
two
ways”,
he
said.
he
said
you
can
restrict
production
from
the
republic
“a”
wells
to
what
--
so
that
it
becomes
ratable
with
what
you're
able
to
take
from
the
rest
of
the
wells
connected
to
northern's
lines.
now,
that
sort
of
an
order
would
have
been
made
under
the
provisions
of
the
basic
proration
order
and
would
have
been
directed
to
producers.
this
witness
said,
“if
you
want
to
do
something
else,
you
can
require
northern
to
purchase
from
all
of
the
other
wells,
the
same
volume
of
gas
that
--
as
determined
under
the
basic
order
again,
as
it
purchases
from
the
republic
“a”
wells,
in
other
words,
bring
it
up.
in
the
one
instance,
they
would
have
had
a
valid
order
addressed
to
producers
and
the
purpose
would
have
been
to
accomplish
ratable
production
in
the
field.
rather,
they
took
the
choice
of
tampering
with
the
sale
of
gas
solely
to
cause
northern
and
any
other
producers
or
purchasers
might
be
in
the
same
situation
to
be
compelled
to
buy
more
gas
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field
than
its
market
requirements.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well
--
yes,
but
that's
true.
that's
true,
so
you
get
back
to
the
old
price
cases.
kansas
says,
“we
want
more
gas
sold
in
this
field”.
okay,
the
next
day,
you
--
if
they're
permitted
to
do
it,
the
next
day
oklahoma
will
say,
“would
you
take
more
from
our
portion?”
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
you
tell
us
what
our
obligations
are
under
the
republic
“a”
contract
and
i
could
answer
it
very
quickly.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
your
honor
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
we
think
that
certain
of
the
intended
effect
was
to
compel
us
to
buy
more
gas
than
our
market
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
now
you
say
will
it
positively
require
that
until
we
get
some
of
these
legal
questions
answered
about
our
liability
under
the
republic
“a”
contract,
if
we
do
not
take
or
purchase
the
allowables
assigned
to
republic
“a”
wells,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
you,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
it's
certainly
--
it
certainly
affects
your
gas
cost
if
we
have
to
pay
for
gas
not
taken.
suppose
we're
obliged
to
pay
some
millions
of
dollars
for
failure
to
purchase
the
legal
allowables
under
republic
“a”
contract
because
we've
got
to
assign
more
of
our
market
to
the
other
wells.
now
that
increased
northern's
gas
cost.
there's
something
said
in
the
state's
brief
about
--
well,
that
can
come
out
in
northern
stockholders
because
it
might
be
determined
to
be
an
improvident
contract.
well,
this
is
one
of
the
initial
contracts
that
was
made
in
1930
for
a
major
supply
of
gas
for
northern
system
and
it
just
couldn't
be
determined
to
be
an
improvident
contract.
so
it
means
that
under
those
circumstances,
our
consumers,
which
are
pretty
numerous,
its
northern's
big
system,
our
consumer's
gas
cost
would
substantially
increase.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
honestly,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
your
honor.
i
must
repeat
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
--
that
some
of
these
questions
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
i
certainly
do
not.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
your
honor,
i
--
if
this
court
determines
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
determination
of
the
kansas
court
on
that
--
its
construction
of
the
orders
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
no.
we
--
it's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
this
--
these
orders
are
invalid
whatever
maybe
determined
with
respect
to
the
contract
question.
if
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
no.
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
so
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
no,
i
don't
believe
we
would
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
right.
it's
kind
of
going
around.
we
feel
it's
invalid.
now
the
next
question
is
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes.
now
the
next
question
is
how
you're
hurt
--
we're
not
hurt
if
--
if
the
effect
of
these
orders
is
to
strike
down
the
take
or
pay
for
provision
in
the
republic
“a”
contract.
now
that's
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
your
honor,
we've
remained
confused
about
just
exactly
what
the
--
we
tried
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
pardon?
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
in
the
republic
suit?
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
we
say
if
it's
valid
that
the
--
we
say
we're
contesting
the
validity
of
it
and
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
and
if
it
--
pardon?
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
we
take
pro
rata
sure
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes.
that's
right.
we're
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
i
--
we've
had
this
litigation,
we
removed
it
twice.
it's
filed
in
the
state
court,
we
removed
it
twice.
we
thought
it's
a
federal
question.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
correct
and
we
removed
it
when
the
cases
were
initially
filed
and
the
matter
was
briefed
to
our
federal
court
in
wichita
and
maybe
we
didn't
do
a
very
good
job,
i
don't
know
but
the
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
--
the
court
remanded
it.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well,
i
think
what
--
excuse
me,
i
don't
know
just
what
their
position
is
as
--
excuse
me.
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
they
say
suppose
it
does
cost
you
some
money
to
take
it
out
of
the
northern
stockholders.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
i
don't
believe
that
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
well
i
wish
your
honor
--
that's
been
on
our
brief
when
we
had
it
removed.
i
think
it's
a
federal
question
your
honor.
i
always
thought
so.
we
regard
very
highly
our
federal
judiciary
in
our
state
but
they
disagreed
with
us
by
it.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
yes.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
[inaudible]
as
a
contract
was.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
right.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
the
way
we
feel
about
it
your
honor.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
over
the
whole
field.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
not
as
--
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
correct
your
honor,
not
as
long
as
it
is
for
a
legitimate
state
purpose
which
means
the
protection
of
correlative
rights
as
between
all
of
the
producers
in
the
field.
that's
a
restriction.
now
what
--
what
we've
got
here
is
attempting
to
force
us
to
purchase
more
gas
rather
than
to
restrict
the
production
--
conservation
means
restriction.
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
got
to
purchase
more.
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
if
--
i'm
talking
about
what
was
the
intention
of
the
kansas
commission.
i
don't
know
what
the
kansas
court
has
determined
in
this
respect.
if
the
kansas
commission
had
meant
to
accomplish
just
what
your
honor
said,
they
would
have
restricted
the
republic
“a”
production
rather
than
try
to
bring
this
production
up
to
the
republic
“a”
wells.
incidentally,
this
very
thing
happened
a
few
years
ago
on
the
republic
“a”
system.
then
at
that
time,
the
kansas
court
approved
a
kansas
commission
order
shutting
in
a
number
of
the
republic
“a”
wells,
so
as
to,
in
other
words,
restricting
their
production,
shut
them
in
so
as
to
accomplish
ratable
production
in
the
kansas
hugoton
field.
now,
that's
the
way
you
get
through
proration.
you
don't
get
it
in
this
fashion
trying
to
force
a
purchaser
to
purchase
more
gas
than
its
market
demand
or
take
or
pay
for
them,
i
mean
you
pay
for
it
if
you
don't
run
it.
now,
i
think
you
got
to
look
at
the
regulatory
atmosphere
that's
behind
all
of
this
and
when
you
do
that,
this
unravels
pretty
fast.
this
is
brought
forth
pretty
forcefully
in
the
memorandums
that
have
been
filed
here
in
behalf
of
the
federal
power
commission.
i
think
they
did
a
little
better
job
on
this
than
we
did.
they
show
commissioner
brady's
statement
as
to
what
the
kansas
commission
was
really
starting
up
and
trying
to
do,
trying
to
compel
purchasers
to
take
more
gas
from
the
kansas
hugoton
field
than
they
had
offered
markets
therefore.
that's
followed
then
by
the
public
statements
of
commissioner
byrd
who
is
now
chairman
of
the
kansas
commission
showing
that
he
is
committed
to
the
same
policy.
then
you
follow
that
with
the
two
courses
that
were
available
here
to
them
as
plainly
shown
from
the
evidence
if
they
wanted
to
restrict
the
production
and
accomplish
ratable
production
that
was
available
to
them.
if
they
wanted
to
go
another
route
and
try
to
compel
more
gas
to
be
purchased
from
the
field,
that
likewise
was
available
to
them.
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
to
whatever
i've
got
to
[inaudible]
mr.
mark
h.
adams,
sr.
thank
you.
