taking
anything
at
20
cents.
under
your
order,
you
have
10
contracts
[inaudible]
you'd
have
to
get
10,000
cubic
feet
i
gather
from
each
well.
each
would
mean
you
have
5
and
10
cents,
and
50,000
and
20
cents,
is
that
the
way
you
--
the
order
have
worked
if
you
had
that
kind
of
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
your
position
is
even
though
that
means
he
has
to
pay
more
money
in
total
for
a
$100,000
and
if
he
could
get
it
all
at
the
10
cent
rate.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
nevertheless
both
the
10
and
20
cents
rates
which
are
approved
by
the
fpc
and
the
only
effect
of
your
order
is
that
he's
got
to
take
it
and
that
you
constitutionally
may
insist
that
he
takes
it
on
a
ratable
basis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
that
it?

[inaudible]
make
a
minimum
at
the
20-cent
rate
of
100,000
feet.
then
is
it
--
he's
required
to
take
more
gas
under
your
order
[inaudible],
if
the
contract
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
get
to
that,
just
let
me
be
sure
i
get
it?
if
the
republic
“a”
contract
[inaudible]
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
obligated
them
to
pay
the
$100,000,
all
they
need
[inaudible].
now,
would
they
not
have
to
pay
[inaudible]
because
having
10
to
make
it,
five
of
them
at
10
cents,
five
of
them
at
20
cents
[inaudible]
of
the
republic
and
the
contract's
obligation
to
take
the
[inaudible],
they'd
have
to
take
a
$100,000
at
20
cents,
then
they'd
have
to
go
and
take
another
$100,000
at
10
cents,
could
they
not,
so
that
it
would
be
20,000
for
each
kind
of
well,
wouldn't
that
be
in
effect
of
your
order?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
have
to
take
100,000
to
--
that's
the
assumption
of
the
republic
“a”
contract,
perhaps
if
they
couldn't
have
but
that's
the
--
in
fact
their
obligation.
i
don't
see
how
they
can
go
elsewhere.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
they'd
have
to
take
it
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
commission
now
makes
the
point
i
gather
on
the
premise
that
this
contract
does
not
have
[inaudible].
i
mean
you've
just
started
to
say
that
private
contractors
should
give
way
to
state
regulations.
i
--
is
that
your
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
i
gather
would
be
an
argument
made
even
if
this
contract
did
not
have
such

justice

how
would
that
dispose
[inaudible]?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

certainly
would
not
dispose
[inaudible]
this
is
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
of
proper
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

within
its
jurisdiction
and
if
that's
the
fact,
other
than
the
immaterial
concept
of
argument.
