mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
if
it
please
the
court,
the
appellants
ask
the
state
ratable
state
orders
on
the
grounds
they
are
void
under
the
supremacy
clause.
in
this
regard,
it
seems
to
me
they
raise
two
questions;
one,
does
the
natural
gas
act
deprive
the
state,
state
of
kansas
of
the
authority
to
require
ratable
taking
simply
because
it
is
asserted
that
the
natural
gas
act
preempts
the
field
of
the
regulation
over
interstate
sale.
now
this
is
a
question
totally
unrelated
to
the
contract.
the
fpc
does
not
think
that
this
question
is
to
be
answered
permanently,
nor
does
the
appellee,
though
appellant
has
obviously
stressed
that
particular
aspect
of
this
case.
the
second
question
is
that,
are
the
kansas
ratable
take
orders
though
of
the
type
otherwise
valid?
in
other
words,
assuming
and
affirming
again
to
the
first
question,
void
because
of
the
special
contractual
provision
in
northern's
contract.
now,
appellee
says
that
both
of
these
questions
should
be
answered
in
the
negative.
it
is
useful
before
disposing
of
these
two
contentions
to
review
just
briefly
the
orders
that
the
state
entered.
these
orders
are
reproduced
in
our
brief
and
--
on
pages
1
and
2.
now
on
page
1,
the
first
order
in
its
pertinent
part
is
set
up.
all
it
does
as
can
be
seen
from
bottom
of
the
page
is
order
northern
national
gas
company
both
to
pay
for
gas
ratably
from
all
wells
which
it
is
connected
in
kansas.
now
this
is
a
specific
order
addressed
to
northern.
it
pertains
only
to
hugoton
field.
the
second
order
set
out
in
more
detail
on
page
2
is
a
broader
order.
it
applies
to
all
purchasers
of
gas
in
kansas.
it
applies
to
all
common
sources
of
supply,
all
gas
fields
in
kansas
most
of
which
do
not
cross
state
lines
and
are
located
solely
within
the
state.
and
this
order
simply
says,
“all
purchasers
take
gas
ratably.”
it
described
that
ratable
production
in
terms
of
keeping
your
over
and
under
production
within
a
reasonable
balance.
now
it
is
clear
from
meeting
these
orders
that
the
orders
don't
mention
price.
they
do
not
set
price
as
was
attempted
in
the
city
service
fees
which
[inaudible]
have
found.
they
do
not
tell
the
purchaser
how
much
gas
he
is
to
pay.
they
don't
tell
him
to
take
any
gas
if
he
doesn't
want
to
take
it.
all
it
says
is
if
you
want
to
take
gas,
do
so
fairly,
do
so
ratably,
so
that
the
producers
within
the
state
of
kansas,
so
the
landowners
within
the
state
of
kansas
are
protected.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
no
sir,
no
sir.
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
our
order
does
not
require
northern
or
any
purchaser
to
go
out
and
get
more
gas
in
any
shape
or
form.
our
order
says,
“if
you
were
to
take
gas
from
the
wells
you
now
have
or
for
any
--
from
anymore
that
you
may
want
to
connect
to
just
be
sure
that
whatever
you
take
is
ratable.”
it's
ratable
in
proportion
to
the
ability
of
the
well
to
produce.
it
doesn't
tell
him
to
go
get
more
gas
at
any
point.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
well,
he
would,
under
that
circumstance
would
be
taking
gas
ratably
from
all
10
of
the
wells.
his
price
for
a
part
of
the
gas
would
be
higher
for
the
five
wells
where
you
described
the
higher
price,
not
by
virtue
of
our
order
of
course
but
by
virtue
of
the
contract.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
only
if
he
entered
into
such
a
contract,
yes.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
you
mean
sufficient
gas
to
meet
his
markets?
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
oh,
no.
no.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
well
whatever
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes,
but
that
--
that
contract
--
that
increased
price
contract
you
speak
of,
the
100%
contract,
must
also
be
filed
by
the
fpc
and
approved.
and
if
it
isn't
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
--
within
the
price
wouldn't
be
higher.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
oh,
the
state
cannot
change
the
price
in
any
way
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
right.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes
sir,
because
whatever
that
price
is
to
be
by
the
contract
must
be
approved
by
the
fpc.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
understand.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
absolutely.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
so
but
now
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
we
stated
that
as
a
position.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that
would
certainly
answer
his
contention.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
it
seems
to
me
i
maybe
missing
the
position
that
the
honorable
justice
is
taking,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
each
of
these
contracts
you
speak
of
must
be
approved
by
the
fpc.
our
order
requiring
ratable
taking
is
an
order
which
of
course
protects
the
producer
and
the
landowner.
the
consuming
public
is
protected
by
the
federal
power
commission's
decision
whether
or
not
that
price
is
proper.
now,
he's
speaking
about
that
the
fpc
approves
a
given
price
and
then
the
contracts
come
back
down
to
the
kansas
level
and
the
kansas
court
--
of
the
kansas
commission
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
right.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
absolutely
your
honor.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that
is
it.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
absolutely
and
if
their
contention
is
correct,
why
even
a
proration
order,
an
allowable
order,
could
be
set
aside
on
their
same
theory.
for
instance,
let's
suppose
that
they
entered
a
contract
take
a
million
feet
of
gas
and
they
say
in
this
contract
--
now,
if
the
state
issues
a
proration
order
which
prohibits
us
from
taking
the
full
million
cubic
feet
of
gas,
nevertheless,
we'll
pay
you
for
that
million
cubic
feet
of
gas.
they
then
would
turnaround
during
the
time
and
challenge
our
order
and
say,
“look,
this
order
is
void
because
you're
making
us
pay
more
for
our
gas”.
the
point
i'm
making
is
the
contract
that
did
it.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
right.
i
think
that's
correct.
i
have
no
desire
to
indicate
that
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
why
i
urge
two
things:
(1)
that
the
kansas
court
may
well
have
so
acted;
and
(2)
that
whatever
effect
this
is
going
to
have
on
the
price
is
under
the
control
of
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
no.
i
don't
think
so
for
this
reason.
i
think
that
the
federal
power
commission
has
complete
control
over
this
situation
that
any
effect
which
is
going
to
occur
is
completely
under
the
control.
let
me
for
instance,
direct
your
attention.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
well,
now
under
sections
4
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
right.
now
let's
go
through
what
the
fpc
can
do.
the
fpc
has
various
powers.
one
of
which
would
be
under
the
sierra
case
to
decide
that
this
contract
was
an
improvident
contract
and
that
it
need
not
be
passed
on
the
effect
of
it,
need
not
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer.
in
other
words,
these
take
or
pay
companies,
these
rates
that
they
have
to
file,
need
not
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer
because
they
voluntarily
agreed
to
this
provision.
the
fpc
has
to
decide
if
that
provision
is
in
the
public
interest.
now
it
could
well
decide
that
it
is
in
a
public
interest
to
have
such
a
provision
for
this
reason
that
it
is
important
for
producers
and
landowners
to
be
enticed
to
enter
into
contracts,
to
sell
gas
into
interstate
commerce.
this
gas
is
needed
by
interstate
consumers
and
therefore
it's
important
to
have
such
a
provision
and
that
the
fpc
says,
“alright,
this
is
in
the
public
interest
and
under
those
circumstances
clearly
the
consumer
should
pay
for
the
increase.”
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
this
is
one
solution
for
this
court.
they
can
remand
--
yes,
they've
seen
your
question
is
and
--
should
the
court
remand
this
back
to
kansas
supreme
court,
the
kansas
supreme
court
decision
as
to
whether
or
not,
the
take
or
pay
provisions
are
affected
in
such
a
way
so
as
to
make
northern
pay
more
than
they
would
otherwise
pass.
all
three
of
the
parties
before
the
court
states
that
if
the
court
wants
to
dispose
of
this
case
in
that
way,
they
could
do
so.
but
i
do
not
claim
that
that
would
be
a
proper
disposition
of
this
type
because
i
believe
that
the
price
aspects
of
this
case
are
totally
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
fpc,
and
this
matter
can
be
completely
protected
by
the
fpc,
and
that
we
don't
need
to
invalidate
what
are
now
valid
state
orders
which
do
serve
a
valid
public
service.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
certainly
don't
think
so.
it
seems
to
me
the
fpc
has
complete
control
over
that
matter
and
that
whatever
we
said
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
of
course
the
fpc
has
set
an
area
contact
--
contract
price
of
11
cents
for
the
whole
state
of
kansas
and
whatever
they
might
enter
to
--
into
in
terms
of
the
contract
price
will
probably
be
struck
down
if
it's
an
excess
of
11
cents.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
believe
it's
16,
i
was
looking
to
them
for
an
answer
on
that.
i
think
it's
16.
of
course,
the
area
price
is
11
cents
for
old
gas
and
i
think
its
16
and
a
half
for
the
new
gas.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
think
the
answer
to
maybe
that
question
and
in
a
sense
all
of
the
questions
that
have
been
posed
to
me
is
that
it's
our
position
that
state
orders
supersede
private
contracts
and
that
it's
not
the
other
way
around.
the
essence
of
the
questions
that
have
been
posed
to
me
suggests
that
by
private
contract,
they
can
avoid
our
state
orders.
of
course,
in
hudson
versus
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes,
i
am
sure
that
they
will
hold
that
state
order
supersedes
contracts.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
they
haven't
held
that
in
this
case.
they
haven't
said
that
northern
doesn't
have
to
pay
for
the
gas.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
in
another
case,
that
is
correct
for
$26
million,
i
believe.
and
the
record
on
that
case,
of
course,
can
come
to
this
court
very
likely
will
for
determination
of
that
question
in
that
case.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes.
i
certainly
will.
if
i
might
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
thank
you.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
don't
think
that's
the
effect
of
our
order
but
i
think
that
would
happen.
i
think
and
i
worded
that
carefully,
i
think
it
would
happen
because
of
their
contract.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes.
now.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
oh
no,
i
think
they
could
go
elsewhere.
i
think
they
could
go
elsewhere.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
well,
they
could
lower
their
takes
in
kansas
down
to
the
ratable
amounts
if
they
want
to
take
it
elsewhere.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
do
you
see
what
i
mean?
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
right.
under
that
assumption
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
under
that
assumption,
i
would
agree
with
you.
yes,
under
that
assumption.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
in
view
of
appellant's
contentions
that
the
--
i'll
just
put
it
this
way.
as
i
--
as
i
understand
appellant's
contentions,
what
they
are
asserting
is
that
the
fpc
has
jurisdiction
over
interstate
sales,
and
that
therefore
there's
conflict
and
that
therefore,
our
order
is
void
under
the
supremacy
clause.
they
in
essence
assert
this,
that
under
sections
4
and
5
of
the
act,
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
rates.
and
under
section
7,
the
commission
has
jurisdiction
over
certificates
and
that
because
of
this
jurisdiction,
they
therefore
have
jurisdiction
over
every
aspect
of
interstate
sale
and
any
state
order
which
touches
on
interstate
sale
is
void.
now
to
me,
this
is
a
non
sectarian.
it
just
doesn't
follow
that
because
the
fpc
has
jurisdiction
over
certain
limited
aspects,
and
therefore
has
jurisdiction
over
every
aspect
of
interstate
sale
and
this
court
has
so
held
in
the
fpc
versus
transcontinental,
365
u.s.
1.
this
court
pointed
this
out
very
clearly.
it
said,
“congress,
in
enacting
the
natural
gas
act,
did
not
give
the
commission
comprehensive
powers
over
every
incident
of
gas
production,
transportation
and
sale.
rather,
congress
was
meticulous
only
to
invest
the
commission
with
authority
over
certain
aspects
of
this
field,
leaving
the
residue
for
state
regulation”.
now
the
question
is,
what
is
that
residue
left
to
state
regulation?
now
it's
well
settled
that
when
congress
enacted
the
natural
gas
act
in
1938,
the
states
had
the
constitutional
power
to
issue
ratable
take
orders.
this
court
has
many
times
held
and
it
is
also
held
that
it
was
not
the
intent
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
deprive
the
states
of
the
power
they
constitutionally
have.
to
paraphrase
the
phillips
decision,
what
this
court
held
was
that
the
natural
gas
act
was
intended
to
fill
the
gas
by
providing
for
federal
regulation
of
those
aspects
which
the
states
could
not
regulate.
in
other
words,
the
controlling
principle
is
whatever
the
states
could
constitutionally
regulate
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
natural
gas
act.
they
can
continue
to
regulate
after
the
passage
of
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
in
1938.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
oh,
pardon
me.
my
answer
was
in
regard
to
the
natural
gas
act.
our
ratable
take
order
was
issued
in
the
october
1959,
that's
the
first
order.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
contract?
first,
it
was
made
in
1930
and
was
--
the
amended
version
of
it
was
made
in
1944.
it
is
the
amended
version
which
is
in
the
record
and
before
this
court.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
and
that
is
why
i
mentioned
the
contract
involved
here
was
in
1944.
now,
no
one
asserts
that
our
order
was
not
issued
for
a
legitimate
purpose,
namely,
to
prevent
drainage
and
to
protect
correlative
rights,
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
this
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
think
he
also
said
that
any
state
who
issues
that
order
to
protect
correlative
rights
has
the
authority
to
do
so.
i
think
his
contention
is
that
this
order
didn't
do
that.
now
i
might
be
mistaken
as
to
his
position,
but
i
believe
that's
correct.
as
this
court
knows,
the
movement
of
gas
with
the
common
reservoir
is
from
a
high
pressure
area
to
a
low
pressure
area
and
what
happened
in
this
case
was
that
northern
was
taking
a
great
amount
of
gas
from
republic
and
causing
drainage
of
gas
from
all
its
other
connections.
now
these
facts
were
expressed
in
terms
of
percentages
in
the
record,
percentages
of
over
production
and
under
production.
northern
was
taking
from
republic
4.29%
overproduced.
whereas,
it
was
taking
from
its
other
connections
522.09%
underproduced.
so
there
was
a
tremendous
difference
in
the
takes
which
was
resulting
in
drainage
as
one
particular
witness
testified
and
he
concluded,
and
i
quote,
“currently
the
correlative
rights
are
being
damaged
in
a
great
amount.”
honorable,
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred
to
kansas
supreme
court
conclusion
to
the
same
effect
that
drainage
was
in
fact
occurred,
and
that
it
needed
to
be
stopped.
there's
no
question
about
this.
counsel
here
has
even
admitted
it
but
in
the
record
he
says
there
is
no
question
since
january
or
maybe
march,
1958,
there
has
not
been
a
ratable
taking
on
the
connections
of
northern
wells
as
reflected
in
the
exhibit
7.
now
it
was
to
bring
about
this
ratable
taking
and
i'd
like
to
urge
that
this
is
an
important
public
interest.
i
recognize
the
consumer
has
important
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i'm
not
so
sure
about
what
it
might
not.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that
it
would
--
that
--
i'm
not
so
sure
of
what
--
such
an
order
wouldn't
be
valid.
in
other
words,
i
think
it
would
be
valid.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
no
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
no
sir,
not
to
impair
the
obligation
of
contracts.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
see.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
well,
the
reason
i
answered
your
question
the
way
i
did,
you
must
remember
that
at
least
in
this
situation,
the
contract
specifically
provides
that
it
is
subject
to
the
valid
provisions
of
state
and
federal
regulation
and
so
i
say
that
it
does
not
impair
the
contract
for
that
reason.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
sir
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
what
i'm
saying
sir
is
that
by
virtue
of
the
terms
of
the
contract,
there
would
be
no
impairment
even
though
we
issued
this
order,
because
they
contracted
to
allow
the
state
to
impair
it.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
let's
put
it
that
way.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes
sir.
i
think
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
well
sir,
i
direct
your
attention
to
one
--
page
164
of
the
record.
now,
what
i
am
referring
to
is
a
portion
of
the
decision
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
who
in
turn
is
quoting
from
the
contract,
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
section
2,
commission
jurisdiction.
this
contract
is
subject
to
all
valid
legislation
with
respect
to
the
subject
matter
hereof,
either
state
or
federal,
and
to
all
valid,
present
and
future
orders,
rules
and
regulations
of
duly
constituted
authority
having
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes,
sir,
it
does
say
future
orders.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that
is
the
proper
interpretation
of
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
don't
think
it
impairs
the
obligation.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
pardon
me.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
well
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
if
that
is
correct,
well
then,
no.
i'll
agree
with
you
on
that.
my
only
argument
with
you
sir,
is
that
it
didn't
in
fact
impair
by
virtue
of
its
own
terms.
they
agreed
to
allow
it.
now,
i
was
mentioning
the
importance
to
the
public
of
these
orders.
to
strike
down
these
orders,
to
declare
them
invalid
will
be
to
deprive
the
state
of
a
means
to
protect
the
landowners
and
producers
against
loss
of
gas
measured
in
millions
of
dollars,
and
this
is
--
there's
a
little
lot
of
gas
than
you
can
see.
the
end
result,
it
seems
to
me
is
that
these
orders
must
be
held
--
be
upheld
to
the
public
interest
and
that
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
states
have
the
power,
they
had
it
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
by
virtue
of
the
intent
of
congress
and
the
decisions
of
these
courts,
they
have
the
power
now
to
issue
ratable
take
orders.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
city
service
case
recognizing
it
--
decided
after
1938,
but
referred
back.
the
case
was
decided
prior
to
1938
specifically
upheld
a
ratable
take
order
of
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes,
sir,
the
same
contract.
now,
they
put
some
weight
on
the
wording
of
our
order
and
they
say,
since
it
leads
on
purchasers
instead
of
on
producers
that
are
orders
valid
for
interference
with
interstate
side.
i'd
like
to
call
the
court's
attention
to
a
provision
in
the
contract
which
provides
that
northern
“shall
have
the
right
to
regulate
the
rate
of
flow
of
gas
from
each
well
and
where
the
purchaser,
northern,
by
contract,
has
the
right
to
regulate
the
rate
of
flow
of
gas.”
now,
if
our
order
have
said,
“northern,
since
you
have
the
right
to
regulate
the
rate
of
flow
of
gas
from
each
well,
you
be
sure
and
regulate
such
flow
so
as
to
produce
ratably.”
now,
i
don't
believe
they
contend
at
time
an
order
was
void
and
yet
that
is
exactly
the
effect
of
our
order.
it
would
be
impossible
for
us
to
issue
an
order
reading
on
production
which
would
accomplish
the
same
ratable
taking
results
that
this
order
did.
two
reasons:
(1)
the
contract
says
the
purchaser
has
the
right
to
regulate
the
flow;
second,
the
extent
of
our
order
is
to
at
least
provide
ratable
production
as
to
all
the
wells
connected
to
one
purchaser.
their
suggestion
would
do
no
more
than
provide
ratable
production
as
to
one
producer.
that's
a
much
more
limited
sense
of
ratable
production.
now
we
recognize
that
our
order
isn't
perfect.
now,
we
don't
provide
ratable
reductions
completely,
but
we
are
certainly
making
every
effort
to
do
that
and
our
order
certainly
provides
a
protection
to
public
interest
much
greater
than
they
are
suggesting.
this
is
recognized
by
our
then
chairman
wiles
on
page
35
of
the
record,
i
don't
think
i
need
to
read
at
this
time,
but
i
do
call
the
court's
attention
to
that.
and
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
our
order
in
effect
is
an
order
requiring
the
ratable
production
of
gas
and
because
it
is,
it
is
a
matter
relating
to
production
and
is
therefore
a
matter
exempt
from
the
fpc
under
section
1
(b)
of
the
act.
now,
there's
another
very
important
reason
why
this
court
should
not
strike
down
the
state
orders
and
that
is
because
it
would
create
the
regulatory
gap
which
this
court
has
said
should
not
be
created
in
the
regulation
of
natural
gas
industry.
it
is
perfectly
clear,
i
don't
believe
anyone
will
contend
that
the
fpc
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
provide
for
ratable
production
of
gas.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
fpc
has
said
they
don't.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
now,
well
i'm
glad
that
came
up
with
this.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
these
contracts
are
simply
filed
with
the
fpc.
they
are
not
necessarily
approved
in
every
aspect
by
the
fpc,
by
the
fpc's
own
rules.
fpc
merely
says
that
if
they
are
offered
for
filing
and
accepted
for
filing,
this
doesn't
mean
that
the
fpc
necessarily
agrees
with
all
the
provisions
in
the
contract
or
that
it
approves
all
the
provisions.
at
a
later
time,
this
is
one
example,
at
a
later
time,
you
can
decide
the
price
stated
in
the
contract
is
not
reasonable
and
of
sense.
i
think
that's
very
important
because
the
mere
filing
of
this
contract
doesn't
imply
fpc
approval
of
the
rate.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
you
mean
if
it
was
unreasonable?
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
well,
theoretically,
they
couldn't
be
in
effect
as
long
as
they
want,
it's
the
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
oh,
it's
still
in
effect.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
1944.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
oh,
i'm
not
suggesting
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
--
the
price
is
unreasonable.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i'm
not
suggesting
the
price
is
unreasonable.
i'm
only
suggesting
whether
they
have
power
to
do
or
not.
as
i've
stated,
the
commission
itself
said
that
they
did
not
have
power
to
regulate
ratable
production.
the
lone
star
gas
company
just
decided
on
october
1952.
the
fpc
said
this
and
i
think
it's
important
in
a
matter
relating
to
petitioner's
desire
to
intervene.
they
said
the
matters
upon
which
petitioner
desires
to
be
heard
in
this
proceeding
relates
to
the
ratable
production
of
natural
gas.
the
correlative
rights
of
producers
and
proration
of
production
among
producers
producing
natural
gas
from
common
reservoirs.
now,
we
are
of
the
opinion,
says
the
fpc,
that
these
are
matters
which
lie
within
the
sphere
of
state
control
and
cannot
constitute
a
basis
for
intervention
and
proceeding
before
this
commission.
now
the
point
i'm
simply
making
is
that
if
the
fpc
doesn't
have
that
jurisdiction
and
these
orders
are
struck
down
so
if
the
state
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
over
the
ratable
production
of
gas,
then
no
regulatory
agency
will
have
that
power.
and
this
court
has
said,
and
congress
has
indicated
its
intention
to
the
contrary,
and
this
court
says
in
panhandle
versus
michigan
public
service
commission,
“in
the
absence
of
federal
regulation,
state
regulation
is
required
in
the
public
interest.”
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
aim
them
to
the
producers
--
for
the
reason
they
would
not
provide
as
adequate
ratable
taking
as
this
order
does,
and
for
the
reason
that
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes.
you
could
issue
a
proration
order
which
would
lower
the
amount
of
gas
that
could
be
taken
from
given
wells
but
now
the
reason
we
didn't
do
that
is
this
that
could
be
just
fine
for
northern.
it
helped
them
a
great
deal
and
if
our
commission's
purpose
was
to
serve
northern
alone,
i'm
sure
we
might
have
done
that,
but
we
have
the
obligation
to
determine
what's
in
the
public
interest
for
all
pipelines
in
our
community
and
there
are
several
other
pipelines
who
have
a
great
need
for
a
greater
amount
of
gas,
the
[inaudible]
pipeline
company.
now,
by
virtue
of
the
way
allowables
are
determined,
it
is
necessary
to
set
allowables
at
a
sufficient
rate
to
allow
all
pipelines
to
serve
their
market
demand.
now
when
this
is
divided
up
in
terms
of
allowables,
it
might
hurt
one
pipeline
or
another
depending
upon
their
market
demand.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
think
the
best
answer
to
that
is,
sir,
that
it's
not
our
orders
that
forces
that,
it's
their
contract.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
assuming
that
their
contract
is
modified?
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
it
might
increase
it
partly
and
that
brings
me
to
a
very
important
fact.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
it
might.
you
noticed
--
you're
saying
it
in
the
affirmative
and
i'm
saying
it
might
and
i
think
that's
a
pretty
important
difference.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
the
basis
of
their
argument.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
really
don't
think
that
was
intended
by
the
commission.
i
think
it
possibly
might
be
a
result
but
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
no
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
why
does
the
--
why
does
the
state
set
allowables
in
excess
of
demand,
i
don't
think
we
do.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
not
in
this
case;
it
isn't.
it
is
one
of
their
contentions
in
the
so-called
market
demand
cases
now
before
the
kansas
supreme
court.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that
is
their
contention
to
market
demand
case.
it
is
not
a
contention
--
i'll
put
it
this
way.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
it's
not
a
contention.
i
think
invalid
to
be
made
here
because
there's
no
record
on
it.
but
--
i'll
answer
you
that
way.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
no,
sir,
in
my
opinion
they
have
not.
the
answer
to
your
question
to
get
--
the
crux
of
your
question
is,
what
is
the
demand?
the
commission
takes
the
position
of
market
demand
cases
and
i'll
take
it
here,
that
the
commission
has
the
power
to
review
the
facts
pertaining
to
what
the
market
is
and
decide
what
it
is.
the
companies
take
the
position
that
they
have
the
power
to
decide
what
it
is.
and
they
say,
“well,
look
their
market
demand
is
a
little
lower
than
the
commission
says
it
is”,
and
here
lies
our
controversy
as
to
whether
or
not
the
state
has
that
power
to
determine
what
that
market
is.
it's
a
question
in
the
market
demand
case,
not
this
one.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
they
call
them
nominations
in
kansas.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
it's
the
same
thing.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
alright,
now,
let's
get
to
the
contract
question.
i
hope
i
have
disposed
of
the
--
what
i
call
the
non-contractual
questions
on
the
basic
principle
of
what
the
states
could
do
prior
to
1938,
they
can
continue
to
do
after
1938
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
that
therefore,
the
natural
gas
act
does
not
conflict
with
the
state
order.
that's
my
first
point
and
i
hope
i've
made
that
clear.
now,
the
second
point
does
consider
these
contractual
questions
which
so
many
questions
have
been
posed
to
me
about
and
that
question
is,
are
the
kansas
orders,
draw
the
type
otherwise
valid
or
the
type
historically
they
could
issue
the
point
as
to
--
is
applied
to
appellant
because
of
its
special
contractual
arrangement.
now
of
course
the
essence
of
this
argument
is,
as
many
of
you
pointed
out,
that
if
the
appellant
complies
with
the
state's
ratable
take
orders,
it
will
and
i'm
going
to
underline,
under
its
contracts,
have
to
pay
for
gas
it
does
not
take.
such
payment
they
contend
would
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer
and
that
because
there's
increase
in
price
passed
to
the
consumer,
there
is
a
conflict
to
the
natural
gas
act.
now,
what
interests
me
about
this
argument
as
i
touch
on
just
briefly
is
that
privately
--
the
argument
is
that
private
contract
can
be
used
to
avoid
state
order.
now
this
of
course
just
reverses
the
usual
concept
that
government
regulation
supersedes
private
contracts
and
the
argument
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
no,
sir,
it
has
to
be
filed
but
not
approved
and
if
it's
an
interstate
contract,
it
doesn't
mean
have
to
be
filed.
now
the
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
correct
and
i'm
willing--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that
is
correct
and
this
goes
back
to
your
honor
justice
black's
questions
to
me
earlier.
in
other
words,
i'm
going
to
--
i'm
going
to
take
on
that
aspect
and
assume
that
section
2
is
not
[inaudible].
the
argument
introduced
by
appellant
in
this
regard
that
there's
going
to
be
a
payment
passed
on
to
the
consumer
and
that
their
contracts
supersede
our
orders,
produces
bizarre
results.
under
the
argument
in
that
effect
is
that
the
kansas
orders
would
be
valid
as
applied
to
all
inner
pipelines
but
they
don't
contend
our
orders
are
not
valid
unless
this
take
or
pay
provision
is
in
the
contract.
they
take
the
take
or
pay
provision
out
and
our
orders
are
perfectly
valid.
the
order
presumably
would
also
be
valid
if
their
contract
was
amended
when
their
take
or
pay
provision
is
taken
out.
in
short,
the
kansas
orders
would
be
valid
in
importance
with
its
contractual
whims
of
appellant
and
i
don't
think
that's
the
law.
if
its
--
if
it
is
the
law,
it's
a
fine
way
for
a
pipeline
company
to
avoid
all
kinds
of
state
orders.
i've
mentioned
one
before
and
let's
take
another
example.
supposing
a
pipeline
company
agrees
to
pay
15
cents
per
mcf
for
its
gas
and
if
it
takes
a
million
cubic
feet
a
day,
and
then
it
says,
but
if
the
kansas
order
requires
us
to
take
less,
we'll
pay
20
cents
per
mcf.
now,
this
is
the
contract.
we're
going
to
take
15
cents
per
mcf,
per
a
million
cubic
feet
a
day,
but
if
the
kansas
orders
us
to
take
a
lesser
amount
of
gas,
we'll
pay
you
20
cents
per
mcf
for
the
amount
we
can
take
at
the
end
of
this
contract.
then,
having
entered
into
the
contract,
they
come
to
us
and
they
say,
“look,
your
order
is
valid”
--
i
mean
void.
“your
order
is
void.”
it's
absolutely
void.
it
causes
us
to
increase
our
price
of
gas.
is
this
a
valid
way
to
avoid
legitimate
state
orders
to
protect
the
public
interest?
let's
take
a
third
example;
supposing
that
a
pipeline
company
enters
into
an
agreement
with
its
producers
and
says,
“look,
we'll
pay
so
much
for
gas
on
the
basis
that
you
as
the
producer,
can
drill
on
every
160
acres”,
but
if
the
kansas
commission
comes
along
and
says,
“oh
no,
you
have
to
drill
on
640
acres
nevertheless,
we'll
pay
you
as
if
you
drilled
on
a
160”.
in
other
words,
if
you
buy
--
in
other
words,
by
contract,
they
agree
that
if
they
can't
comply
with
state
orders,
they'll
pay
an
increased
amount
of
money.
then
they
come
along
and
they
argue
oh!
look,
these
kansas
orders
are
all
bad.
they
call
us
to
increase
our
price
of
gas.
now,
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
a
company
who
is
supposed
to
be
regulated
by
a
state
agency,
who's
supposed
to
be
regulated
by
the
fpc,
can
be
allowed
by
its
own
contracts
to
determine
whether
an
order
is
void
or
not
void.
now,
nevertheless,
the
appellant
asserts
that
these
orders
create
conflict
to
natural
gas
act.
i
assert
that
is
not
true
that
whether
there's
to
be
an
increase
is
solely
within
the
hands
of
the
federal
power
commission.
i
have
mentioned
that
any
additional
costs
could
be
charge
to
the
stockholder.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
they
can,
under
section
4
and
under
section
5,
determine
that
the
rates
are
unreasonable
and
to
set
new
rates
under
those
sections
in
the
act.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
absolutely.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
well,
now
that's
--
what
we're
here
concerned
with
is
whether
or
not
the
fpc
could
strike
out
a
take
or
pay
provision.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
a
take
or
pay
provision,
a
provision
in
the
contract
which
says,
you
must
pay
for
a
gas
that
you
don't
take.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
might
say
this
in
a
partial
answer
to
your
question.
this
is
about
the
cheapest
gas
in
the
whole
united
states
and
even
republic
has
pointed
out
in
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
this
sale
--
this
contract
price
that
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
right.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
right.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
think
it's
a
20-year
contract.
they've
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
think
that
the
fpc
could
strike
out
these
take
or
pay
provisions.
now,
that's
totally
different
from
whether
or
not
the
rate
per
mcf
is
reasonable.
a
take
or
pay
provision
accepts
the
mcf
rate
set
out
in
the
contract
and
simply
applies
that
rate
to
the
amount
of
gas
not
taken.
now,
if
that
is
allowed
to
remain
in
the
contract
then
it
is
possible
that
the
consumer's
price
would
be
increased.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
it
could
be
avoided
by
the
federal
power
commission
deciding
that
this
take
or
pay
provision
not
the
reasonable
price
per
mcf,
but
this
take
or
pay
provision
is
not
in
the
public
interest
because
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes,
sir.
yes
sir,
they
could.
they
could
then
take
ratably
and
not
have
any
economic
penalties
attached
to
them.
they
could
then
lower
their
takes
from
the
republic
“a”
well.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
no
sir.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
well,
i
said,
“no
sir”,
for
this
reason.
your
question
is
assuming
something
that
i
don't
think
is
a
fact
and
that
is
that
they're
going
to
have
to
buy
more
gas.
they've
got
gas
running
out
the
rear.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i'm
handed
the
note
here
which
may
help.
the
effective
republic
price
in
1959
was
16.75
cents.
the
effective
price
of
other
northern
connections
in
kansas
was
11.59%.
in
other
words,
you
pay
less.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
in
other
words,
you
pay
less
instead
of
more
for
the
gas.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
pay
less.
in
other
words,
the
effective
price
of
the
northern
connections
in
kansas
other
than
republic
“a”
was
11.59.
so
if
they,
by
our
order,
can
take
more
gas
from
connections
other
than
republic
“a”,
they
can
take
it
at
a
lesser
price,
not
a
higher
price.
in
other
words,
if
our
order
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
correct.
they
can.
that
is
right.
in
other
words,
i've
been
trying
to
answer
your
questions
on
the
assumptions
you've
been
giving
me,
the
assumptions
have
not
been
supported
by
the
facts
in
the
record.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
correct.
that
is
correct.
i've
tried
to
deal
with
your
question
straight
on
but
i
did
want
to
straighten
the
record
on
it
your
honor.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
right.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
right
and
they
can't
--
want
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
right.
i
think
that
is
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
think
they'd
love
to
lose
this
lawsuit
to
just
hold
it.
they
don't
have
to
pay
for
the
gas.
now,
in
short,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
no
conflict
but
rather
there
is
harmony.
our
kansas
order
will
protect
the
kansas
landowners
and
the
kansas
producers,
and
this
is
a
very
vital
need
for
the
public.
on
the
other
hand,
the
fpc
will
have
the
ability
to
protect
the
consumer.
together,
the
public
is
fully
protected.congress
contended
and
even
what
this
court
has
said
should
be
the
case
that
a
comprehensive
and
effective
regulatory
scheme
should
be
provided.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
factual
basis.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
are
you
asking,
are
there
take
or
pay
provisions
in
all
the
contracts?
no.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
how
common
are
they?
take
or
pay
contracts
are
fairly
common
provision
nowadays.
however,
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
tell
us
whether
the
contracts
in
other
states
contain
take
or
pay
contracts.
now,
this
is
an
important
point.
in
view
of
their
basic
contention,
namely,
they're
going
to
have
to
pay
for
gas
they
don't
take.
it
seems
to
me
the
state
commission
ought
to
have
evidence
presented
to
them
and
that
this
court
ought
to
be
able
to
review
evidence
which
shows
what
the
provisions
in
the
contract
in
other
states
are.
do
they
have
take
or
pay
contracts
which
are
going
to
force
the
thing
the
honorable
justice
black
refers
to.
do
the
contracts
have
make-up
provisions
in
them?
now,
a
make-up
provision
simply
provides
that
if
you
have
to
at
some
particular
time,
pay
for
a
gas
that
you
do
not
take,
you
will
nevertheless
have
the
opportunity
at
a
later
time
to
make
up
and
take
that
gas
which
you
paid
for
earlier,
so
that
in
the
long
run,
they
might
not
be
having
to
pay
for
any
gas
that
they
didn't
take.
the
net
result
of
this
would
be,
there'd
be
no
increase
cost
in
the
price
of
gas
beyond
that
contracted
for
and
that
increased
price
will
according
--
accordingly
not
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer
and
there'd
be
no
conflict
to
the
natural
gas
act.
the
record
is
highly
speculative.
it
is
uncertain
and
yet
to
be
determined
what
these
facts
are
and
another
thing
yet
to
be
determined,
this
is
something
that
has
been
referred
to
here
from
time
to
time,
and
that
is,
“what
is
the
market?”
“what
are
the
markets
of
northern?”
the
record
doesn't
tell
it.
we
don't
know
whether
the
fpc
could
issue
some
more
certificates
and
let
the
increased
amount
of
gas
be
adequately
consumed.
these
things
are
just
not
in
the
record.
now,
all
i'm
saying
is
that
with
the
factual
basis
to
support
appellant
contentions
not
in
the
record,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
they're
reconstituted
or
entitled
to
any
sort
of
consideration
here.
now,
appellant
attacks
the
motive
of
the
state
commission
in
issuing
its
ratable
take
orders.
it
says
that
the
appellee
was
seeking
to
force
more
gas,
more
kansas
gas
into
interstate
commerce.
now
these
allegations
are
simply
not
true.
the
purpose
of
the
kansas
rate
of
a
take
order
was
to
require
all
purchasers
including
northern
to
pay
gas
rates.
and
this
purpose
is
spelled
out
on
the
face
of
the
act.
it
says
we
want
to
protect
the
landowners
and
the
producers
in
an
equitable
way.
now
let
me
make
my
point
clear.
we're
not
seeking
to
protect
the
landowners
and
producers
at
the
expense
of
the
consumer.
we're
seeking
to
protect
this
set
of
landowners
against
this
set.
we're
trying
to
let
all
landowners,
all
producers
have
the
easy
sense,
an
equal
amount
of
gas
taken
from
their
wells,
the
ratable
amount.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
state
corporation
commission
does
release
it.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes,
you
are
wrong
in
--
you
are
correct
in
that
they
have
proration
orders
which
assigned
the
maximum
amount
a
well
may
take.
you
are
incorrect
in
saying
that
there
are
no
--
you
did
say
that
there
are
no
states
that
do
not
have
ratable
take
orders,
they
do.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
most
states
simply
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
pardon
me.
most
states
have
just
proration
orders.
some
states
have
ration
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
oh
yes
sir.
we
would.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes
sir.
our
proration
orders
do
not
guarantee
ratable
production.
all
they
do
is
set
the
maximum
amount
of
gas
that
maybe
taken
if
a
company
chooses
not
to
take
the
maximum
amount.
it
might
choose
to
take
more
from
one
than
from
another.
so
the
only
way
we
can
guarantee
ratable
production
is
the
order.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
no.
the
company
does
do
that
but
when
the
state
corporation
commission
reviews
that
action
and
issues
an
order
which
shows
them
where
they
stand
status
wise,
puts
them
on
notice
that
if
--
status
wise,
they're
not
taking
ratably
they
better
start
doing
it
and
then
the
penalties
will
catch
after
that.
now,
one
more
point
on
the
motive
point
that
i
think
is
very
important,
they
assert
to
kind
of
take
--
make
them
take
more
gas
from
kansas
and
hurt
oklahoma,
hurt
texas.
i
call
to
your
honors'
attention
that
oklahoma,
texas
and
15
other
state
attorneys
general
have
filed
a
brief
amicus
curiae
saying
validate
this
order.
this
is
what
the
state
of
oklahoma
wants.
this
is
what
the
state
of
texas
want.
they're
important
for
owners,
for
landowners
and
producers
that
are
important
to
the
public
interest.
now,
let
me
just
mention,
the
railroad
commission
of
texas
versus
permian
basin
pipeline
under
302
s.w.
2d
238
appealed
dismissed,
358
u.s.
37.
that
case
is
exactly
important.
the
same
types
of
contracts
were
involved.
the
same
questions
of
law
were
involved;
jurisdiction
of
fpc
question
is
involved.
interstate
commerce
was
involved,
due
process,
all
of
it.
the
same
type
of
order,
ratable-take
orders,
everything
is
the
same
including
counsel.
the
company
is
a
subsidiary
of
northern
or
was
not
a
part
of
northern.
in
that
case,
the
texas
courts
upheld
the
ratable
take
order
as
serving
a
balanced
public
interest
and
this
court
in
reviewing
the
matter
on
appeal
determined
that
the
case
should
be
dismissed
for
not
raising
a
substantial
federal
question.
now,
for
the
foregoing
reasons,
i
would
like
to
submit
that
this
court
heard
the
decision
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
upholding
the
validity
of
the
ratable
take
orders
and
i
urge
you
to
do
so
because
it
will
accomplish
justice.
now,
i
don't
say
that
just
colloquially.
i
really,
sincerely
mean
they
will
protect
the
consumer.
the
fpc
can
take
care
of
that.
it
will
protect
the
producers.
it
will
protect
the
landowners
and
it
will
indeed
provide
equity
for
all.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
if
it
is
to
be
remanded,
it
would
be
remanded
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
northern
is
contractually
obligated
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that's
right.
yes
sir.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
don't
think
it
would
adequately
dispose
of
it
but
they
contend
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that
is
correct.
it
would
not.
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
that
is
correct.
i
think
it
is
and
i
think
it's
important
for
the
--
as
long
as
the
case
is
here
for
the
court
to
lay
down
the
law
on
this
point.
if
the
fpc
has
jurisdiction
as
to
the
matters
or
the
state,
the
company
is
entitled
to
know,
the
state
ought
to
know.
i
certainly
think
the
states
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
well,
i'm
in
an
agreement
with
you
so
i
kind
of
hate
to
tell
you
about
the
other
side
but
--
mr.
charles
c.
mccarter
i
prefer
it
not
be
remanded,
but
if
it
must
be
remanded,
that
is
better
than
reversal.
i'll
put
it
that
way.
