well
that
--
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
that
turn
on
the
construction
of
the
republic
“a”
contract?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
don't
think
that
the
kansas
court
gave
an
answer
to
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
agree
with
the
amicus
brief
of
the
government
that
that
should
be
remanded
to
the
court
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
--
for
resolution
of
the
state
law
question?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
that
was
your
position
that
is
necessary
to
have
a
determination
of
that
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
that's
moot
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
your
argument
--
i
gather
from
your
brief
is
that
this
kansas
order
modified
pro
tanto,
the
obligation
to
take
under
the
republic
contract.
justice
william
o.
douglas
if
that
is
so,
i
suppose
that
is
the
answer
to
justice
black.
justice
william
o.
douglas
on
the
question
of
–
[inaudible]
still
outstanding
and
i
would
take
it
this
--
that
that
could
be
--
require
the
petitioner
here
to
take
more
gas
than
[inaudible]
justice
william
o.
douglas
that's
why
you
urge
that
this
--
kansas
court
modify
pro
tanto
the
obligations
under
the
republic
contracts.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
if
there's
any
doubt
about
that
that
should
be
remanded
with
the
state
court,
shouldn't
it?
