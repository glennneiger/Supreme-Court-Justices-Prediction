justice

black
your
desire
to
purchase
gas
from
certain
people
in
kansas.
justice

and
they
were
present
before
the
fpc,
both
the
purchaser
as
well
as
distributor
in
interstate

and
the
seller
who
is
in
kansas?
justice

then
what
happens?
justice

l.
black
one
what?
justice

black
all
of
which
were

you

black
in
kansas
or
all
over
the

justice

black
in
kansas?
justice

so
that
you
have
an

local
kansas
people
whereby
they
shall
put
the

supply
you
a

justice

you
have
to

off?
justice
hugo

black
and
that's
approved
by
the
fpc?
justice
hugo

black
and
you
say
that,
the
state
of
kansas
says
that
it
can
change
that
contract
which
has
been
approved
by
requiring
you
to
buy
where
and
how
they
change
that
contract,
how
do
they
change
that
contract?
justice

black
how
do
they
change
yours
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
different
companies?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
kansas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other

you
must
pay
what
kansas
says
you
should
take
in
order
to
produce
a
ratable
distribution
of
oil
from
the
different
wells.
justice
hugo

black
can
the

handle
that?
could
they
do
that?
justice

black
well,
i'm
asserting
[inaudible]
justice

black
company
worthy
of

justice

what
do
you
mean
by
that?
justice

black
this
well
[inaudible]

some

demanded

more
from

includes

that
field

justice

black
is
there
anyway
you
can
comply
with
this
order
without
buying
your
gas
[inaudible]?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
talking
about
under
the
kansas
claim.
if
it's
put
into
effect
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it
was
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
you've
stated
in
your
argument,
one
of
the
basic
arguments
are
not
--
i'm
not
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
your
basic
arguments
leads
one
[inaudible]
why
you
say
this
could
not
be
done
[inaudible]
between
you
and
your
company
which
have
been
approved
by
the
fpc
and
it's
the
consequences
[inaudible]
will
increase
the
cost
of
that
gas
above
that
which
has
been
approved
by
the
fpc?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you're
claiming
about
the
standard
with
the
provision
is
invalid
because
you
have
a
contract
that's
been
approved
by
the
federal
government
under
federal
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
which
[inaudible]
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
dispute
between
you
and
the
other
side
in
reference
to
[inaudible]
will
be
indicated
that
that
provision
is
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
of
course
raises
your
question
that
all
the
stockholders
like
in
all
of
those
corporations
would
be
entirely
be
liable
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
validity
of
the
contract
was
approved
by
the
government.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
that
might
be
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
covered
by
the
law
either
one
of
them
[inaudible]
but
as
you
raise
it,
it
seems
more
to
be
a
--
be
more
like
a
federal
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
said
that
because
i
--
from
your
premise,
i
don't
know
that
premise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
your
premise
you
would
say
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
is
a
contract
which
is
protected
because
the
federal
law
protects
it
and
of
course,
if
the
federal
law
protects
it,
it's
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
the
state
of
kansas
contract
law
on
your
premise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
assume
did
not
change
because
the
--
the
validity
of
that
contract
as
stated
by
federal
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
had
a
contract
outstanding
to
buy
from
10
people,
had
a
fixed
price
in
companies
[inaudible]
and
this
order
required
them
to
go
out
and
make
new
contracts
which
[inaudible]
more
people
whatever
price
they
could
get.
was
that
--
is
that
what
they
would
do
--
required
to
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
--
it
--
suppose
that
it
have
noticed
some
of
these
of
contracts
have
changed
in
a
matter
of
price
from
time
to
time
so
they
had
10
contracts,
five
of
them
at
one
price
and
five
of
them
is
100%
above
that.
what
would
happen
to
them
if
he
complied
with
the
order
for
buying
[inaudible]
on
those
return?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
it
would
--
it
would
follow
because
of
your
order,
you'd
have
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
but
if
he
didn't
do
it,
he
wouldn't
get
all
of
his
gas.
justice
hugo
l.
black
creating
gas
to
meet
his
contract
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
that
the
effect
of
it
under
both
circumstances
would
be
requiring
him
to
pay
a
substantial
amount
more
despite
he
had
agreed
upon
that
is
fixed
--
approved
by
the
fpc.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
five
--
he
has
to
--
he
has
to
increase
his
purchase
from
five
and
those
five
will
pay
requirements,
say
a
100%
more
than
--
what
if
he
bought
from
the
others
so
that
if
the
price
goes
up
accordingly
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
good
would
it
do
if
the
state
could
change
it
by
an
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
it
couldn't
change
it
by
saying
we
are
doing
this
for
change
and
make
you
pay
more.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
it's
going
to
accomplish
the
same
thing
by
leaving
those
words
out
and
requiring
them
to
bring
about
a
distribution
in
that
purchase
which
would
increase
the
price
for
a
100%
that
would
certainly
nullify
the
price
fixed
by
the
fpc,
would
it
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
if
it's
to
be
approved
again
and
then
suppose
the
state
issued
another
order
requiring
something
of
that
kind,
it
had
to
be
approved
again
but
you
do
not
--
that
does
not
give
finality.
i'm
not
saying
that
invalidates
the
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
just
only
getting
to
the
effects
of
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
not
give
finality
to
the
original
order
with
fixing
--
approving
the
price
at
which
they
have
bought
the
gas,
because
of
the
fact
that
prior
to
this
order,
[inaudible]
among
those
who
have
small
price
and
those
who
have
a
much
larger
price,
his
rate
might
be
increased
a
100%,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
can
you
avoid
it
under
those
circumstances?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
answer
it
to
the
extent
that
it
could
answer
it,
it
modified
contract
by
requiring
him
to
pay
more
than
the
fpc
had
approved
the
price
they
must
purchase
the
gas.
the
question
still
remains
as
to
whether
kansas
could
do
this,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
any
--
in
fact,
i
would
suppose
they
substitute
in
effect
a
low
price
at
which
he'd
originally
bought
it.
it
wouldn't
have
that
power,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
say
the
stockholder
could
afford
to
lose
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
do
have
to
invalidate
what
are
now
had
been
valid
contracts
as
to
price,
do
you
not,
under
the
illustration
i
gave
you
and
do
you
not
accomplish
by
that
precisely
the
same
thing
in
kansas,
trying
to
accomplish,
fixing
the
price
for
its
sale
instead
of
letting
the
fpc
fix
the
rate?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
have
--
could
they
have
complete
control?
you
have
a
right
to
say
you
got
to
buy
[inaudible]
from
these
people
over
here
and
you
can't
get
from
them
at
the
same
time.
therefore,
you
do
a
way
with
their
contract,
their
valid
contract
which
was
valid.
and
i
had
an
idea
that
one
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
give
some
kind
of
stability
in
the
prices
so
that
the
companies
couldn't
change
them
or
the
state
couldn't
change
them
at
will
when
they've
agreed
to
make
a
contract
price.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
kansas.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
couldn't
go
anywhere
else
could
they,
applying
your
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
the
ratable
take,
it
wouldn't
be
ratable.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that
is
a
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
breach
of
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
the
act
passed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
a
rate
of
--
ratability
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
the
contract
made?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
court
recognizes
that
there's
a
difference
between
the
powers
of
the
state
to
pass
laws
regulating
the
same
--
the
whole
contracts
were
made
and
would
that
the
same
kind
of
law
after
the
contract
was
made
to
invalidate
the
contract.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
suppose
your
statute
have
said,
[inaudible]
in
view
of
the
importance
that
you're
saying
on
ratability
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
hereby
declare
that
all
contracts
made
before
that
which
did
not
--
were
not
based
on
ratability,
they
will
be
null
and
void,
there's
no
effect
without
regard
to
the
damages
that
maybe
done
through
these
people
who
have
contracts,
would
that
be
invalid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
not
or
would?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
it'd
be
valid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
compare
the
obligations
to
the
contrary
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
valid
one
they've
just
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
--
i
was
assuming
that
it
did
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
held
that
all
the
con
--
it
said
that
the
legislature
declared
that
all
contracts
made
previous
of
this
time,
which
were
not
based
on
ratability
of
production,
are
void
and
of
no
effect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
in
view
of
the
long
history
of
the
provision
of
this
country,
not
to
impair
the
obligation
of
the
previous
contracts
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
so
important
this
tradition
that's
it
put
in
the
constitution,
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
the
court
would
likely
read
the
statute
that
way
unless
it
said
it,
would
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
did?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
i'd
like
to
see
in
the
contract.
is
that
in
the
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
they
contract
it
to
allow
the
state
to
impair
these
people
--
so
that
they'd
have
to
pay
more
from
--
they
agreed
to
pay
a
businessman
[inaudible]
sometime
of
little
chairs
about
making
agreements
like
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
says
valid
orders
and
you
writ
--
you
then
run
head
long
again
up
into
provision
as
to
whether
an
order
would
be
valid
if
it
impaired
the
obligation
of
a
contract
which
was
valid
when
it
was
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
says
future
valid
orders,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
--
would
it
be
valid
if
it
impaired
the
obligation
of
a
contract?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
would
it
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
impaired
the
obligation
of
existence,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
would
it
be
valid?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
does
have
power
however,
does
it
not,
to
validate
contracts
made
on
the
basis,
recognition
of
the
laws
of
the
state
as
it
existed
at
the
time
with
reference
to
ratability.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
have
these
ones
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
did
the
fpc
leave
this
one
in
the
past?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
long
did
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
decided
when?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
time
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
suppose
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
if
you
give
that
contract,
you
could
get
to
that
difference
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
it'd
be
possible,
this
idea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it
be
solely
in
that
hand
if
its
contract
which
came
at
this
time
according
to
all
of
the
case
that
has
come
before
us
through
the
intervening
years,
the
prices
have
shut
up
with
reason
--
with
reasonable
record
if
you
can
say
the
least.
how
can
the
federal
power
commission
affect
the
consumers
from
not
having
to
pay
an
extraordinarily
high
price
for
this
gas
under
this
new
rate?
how
can
the
fpc
protect
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
would
agree,
wouldn't
you
that
the
present
rates
are
a
great
deal
higher
than
the
rates
at
which
they
were
bought
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
rates
[inaudible]
which
has
been
approved
by
the
fpc.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
how
could
it
now
hold
the
rate
which
it
reasonably
--
recently
approved
as
reasonable
are
no
longer
reasonable,
simply
because
these
people
are
going
to
buy
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
wouldn't
happen
would
it,
if
you'll
order
strictly
to
where
--
the
only
way
they
can
get
it
is
by
paying
a
lot
more
and
the
only
way
they
can
take
themselves
–
[inaudible]
the
only
way
the
consumers
can
be
protected
from
that
is
for
them
not
to
have
to
pay
more.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
year?
justice
hugo
l.
black
this
contract
price
is
about
the
cheapest
[inaudible]
in
the
united
states
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
back
at
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
for
what
--
over
what
year
of
this
time
was
the
contract
to
run?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you're
saying
that
you're
offering
that
as
a
justification
for
kansas
[inaudible]
saying
that
the
consumers
will
have
to
bear
the
burden
of
an
increased
price
although
the
company
from
which
they
had
purchased
was
[inaudible]
enough
to
make
a
contract
at
the
lower
price?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
possible,
how
can
it
be
avoided?
justice
hugo
l.

that
you
get
out

they
made

they

pay
you
