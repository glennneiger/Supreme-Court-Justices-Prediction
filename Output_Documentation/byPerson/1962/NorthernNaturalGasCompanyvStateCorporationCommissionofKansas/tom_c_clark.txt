justice

c.
clark
--
it
would
require
you
to
buy
more
gas
than
you
wanted
to
buy
or
you
can
buy
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
--
[inaudible]
purchases
among
the
different
wells
[inaudible]
--
which
would
bring
about
what
they
call
[inaudible]?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
suppose
the
--
your
republic
“a”
contract
did
not
have
your
minimum
requirements;
just
assume
that,
would
you
be
heard
under
this
order?
justice
tom
c.
clark
will
you
--
you'll
be
attacking
it?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
it's
your
defense
that
the
order
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
but
he
would
do
it
just
to
[inaudible]
--
justice
tom
c.
clark
they're
pro
rata
part,
you
wouldn't
take
the
minimum.
justice
tom
c.
clark
as
the
order
requires?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
you
claim
that
the
order
authorized
that
and
therefore
the
contract,
if
that
is
the
order
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
get
a
federal
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
suppose
under
your
theory
why
--
i
suppose
the
impact
of
this
order
was
[inaudible]
financial
side
is
it
destroy
the
[inaudible]
then
that
production
which
has
been
dedicated
to
interstate
commerce
and
under
the
control
of
the
federal
power
commission
would
be
lost.
and
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
act
is
the
[inaudible],
what
is
your
answer
to
that?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you're
not
sure
whether
your
court
will
hold
that
or
not,
are
you?
they
haven't
held
that.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
haven't
held
that
yet,
have
they?
justice
tom
c.
clark
and
republic
is
selling
to
these
people.
justice
tom
c.
clark
are
you
going
to
deal
with
that
point
they
raise
about
the
amount?
justice
tom
c.
clark
before
it
gets
back
to
your
proposition
to
whether
or
not
the
order,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
contract
should
obtain
[inaudible]
that
minimum
requirement.
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
could
say
that
they
could
not
produce
over
a
certain
[inaudible]
in
this
field
because
one
well
can
produce
(inaudible)
a
thousand
cubic
feet.
justice
tom
c.
clark
they
can
go
out
and
buy
form
some
other
wells,
couldn't
they?
they
[inaudible]
--
here,
you
make
these
people
buy
gas
or
pay
and
not
take
gas
that
they
don't
need
at
all,
beyond
their
market.
justice
tom
c.
clark
even
said
on
the
contract
by
examining
the
contract,
it
was
modified,
that's
going
to
increase
the
cost
of
this
company's
gas,
isn't
it,
because
they'll
have
to
go
to
the
other
company,
they'll
take
more
from
the
company's
wells.
justice
tom
c.
clark
no.
justice
tom
c.
clark
then
that
would
increase
the
cost
to
consumers.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
isn't
that
the
basis
of
your
whole
claim?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
mean
the
basis
of
the
commission,
the
kansas
commission.
they
wanted
to
--
prorate
it
among
the
various
producers
to
bring
in
more
money
to
kansas
(inaudible)
--
they
had
a
higher
price.
justice
tom
c.
clark
i'd
like
to
know
also
why
--
why
do
they
have
allowables
in
excess
of
demand?
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
that's
one
of
their
contentions,
was
it
not?
justice
tom
c.
clark
i
thought
one
of
their
contentions
was
if
you
set
the
allowables
higher
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
[inaudible]
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
have
they
consistently
raised
the
allowables
above
demands?
justice
tom
c.
clark
you
filed
[inaudible]
in
texas?
justice
tom
c.
clark
nomination.
justice
tom
c.
clark
thank
you.
justice
tom
c.
clark
well,
