mr.
philip
h.
ward

may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
an
appeal
from
the
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
that
held
pennsylvania's
bible-reading
statute
being
unconstitutional
establishment
of
religion.
now,
this
case
is
different
from
the
case
you
have
just
heard
because
in
pennsylvania,
the
bible-reading
statute
does
not
require
that
the
lord's
prayer
be
said,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
lord's
prayer.
it
is
the
practice
at
abington
township
during
the
morning
exercises
to
follow
the
statutory
bible
reading
with
the
recitation
of
the
lord's
prayer.
however,
that
is
not
the
practice
in
all
of
pennsylvania.
the
decree
that
has
enjoined
abington
in
this
case
and
the
court
below
found
it
was
unconstitutional
either
to
read
the
10
verses
of
the
bible
pursuant
to
pennsylvania
statute
either
alone
or
in
conjunction
with
the
recitation
of
the
lord's
prayer.
consequently,
the
basic
issue
in
my
case
is
a
constitutionality
of
reading
10
verses
of
the
bible
without
comment
to
the
school
children
of
pennsylvania,
or
if
the
court
finds
that
that
practice
is
unconstitutional,
it
need
not
concern
itself
with
the
lord's
prayer.
and
if
it
finds
that
practice
is
constitutional,
the
reading
of
the
10
verses,
but
that
following
it
with
the
recitation
of
the
lord's
prayer
effects
the
constitutionality
of
the
bible
reading
then
of
course
it
could
frame
a
decree
accordingly.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
no,
sir.
there
is
a
record
in
this
case.
we
also
believe
that
this
case
is
different
from
any
of
the
cases,
the
church
state
cases
this
court
is
heretofore
considered.
we
think
we
have
a
novel
factual
situation
here.
we
think
the
question
presented
for
this
court
for
the
first
time
is,
what
does
the
constitution
require
us
to
do
with
an
old
tradition
that
has
undoubted
secular
values,
it's
noncompulsory,
but
yet
it
in
some
ways
reflects
the
religious
origin
of
the
country?
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
i
just
--
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
actually,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
because
nobody
asked
to
be
excused.
we
could
speculate
the
public
address
system
typed
into
each
room.
you
can
turn
off
a
button
so
that
one
room
will
be
no
noise
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
from
turning
it.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
that
question
never
arose.
we
shall
argue
that
the
religious
liberties
of
the
schempp's
who
were
the
appellees
--
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
not
infringed
that
this
case
doesn't
concern
the
establishment
of
religion
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
and
that
there
is
no
requirement
that
pennsylvania
must
give
up
an
ancient
custom
simply
because
it
involves
the
use
of
the
bible.
now,
this
litigation
started
five
years
ago
when
the
original
complaint
was
filed.
at
that
time,
the
bible-reading
statute
of
pennsylvania
provided
that
10
verses
of
the
holy
bible
had
to
be
read
at
the
opening
of
each
school
day,
provided
it
will
be
read
by
the
teacher
in
charge
and
it
further
provided
that
in
the
event
the
teacher
refused
to
participate,
he
could
be
dismissed.
the
complaint
filed
by
the
schempp's
under
that
statute
said
that
the
practice
at
abington,
reading
the
bible
according
to
the
statute
following
it
with
the
recitation
of
the
lord's
prayer,
violated
their
religious
consciences
and
liberties,
interfered
with
the
rights
of
the
parents
to
raise
their
children
and
the
method
of
their
own
belief.
and
also
practiced
--
the
practice
fostered
contradictory
beliefs.
they
sought
an
injunction
against
the
reading
of
the
bible
following
by
the
lord's
prayer.
now,
there
was
a
trial
held
and
we
have
a
record
in
this
case.
the
trial
was
held
and
the
three
schempp
children,
roger,
ellory
and
donna,
testified
that
they
had
been
compelled
to
attend
bible
reading.
they
testified
that
many
passages
from
the
bible
read
to
them,
confused
them,
aggrieved
them,
and
taught
some
things
which
was
contrary
to
their
belief
at
home.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
they're
--
the
two
--
roger
--
ellory,
who
was
the
oldest,
mr.
justice
harlan
has
graduated.
he's
about
21.
but
roger
and
donna,
i
think
are
17
and
19
but
in
any
event
they're
both
presently
at
abington
high
school,
senior
class.
in
addition
to
the
testimony
of
these
children,
we
had
the
testimony
of
two
experts.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
sir?
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
they
are
unitarian.
we
had
the
testimony
of
the
two
experts,
who
testified
concerning
the
bible
pretty
much
as
your
honors
would
expect
that
the
bible
is
a
great
document.
it's
an
old
document.
it
comes
from
certain
basic
original
sources.
that
it
is
a
religious
document
in
the
sense
that
it
has
moral
literary
value
that
dr.
grayzel,
who
was
an
eminent
jewish
theologian,
testified
that
all
of
the
new
testament
and
parts
of
the
old
testament
would
be
--
would
offend
the
belief
of
the
jews.
as
a
result
of
that
trial,
the
lower
court,
the
three-judge
court
found
that
the
practice
of
reading
the
bible
pursuant
to
the
old
compulsory
statute,
followed
by
the
saying
of
the
lord's
prayer,
amounted
to
an
establishment
of
religion
because
it
said
the
bible
deals
with
man's
relationship
to
god.
that
this
daily
reading
is
a
daily
reminder
of
that
relationship
and
this
daily
reading
indoctrinates
the
children
and
that
consequently
also
the
parent's
rights
were
abridged.
it
said
it
violates
free
exercise
and
that
ellory
and
the
children
were
forced
to
attend.
and
then
it
said,
since
the
teachers
had
to
read
under
pain
of
dismissal,
they
would
try
to
get
a
large
audience
for
the
bible
reading
to
hear.
the
main
point,
the
main
thrust
--
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
we
--
you
recall
under
the
statute
as
it
then
stood,
it
required
that
the
teacher
in
charge
reading
the
bible
or
cause
it
to
be
read
and
any
teacher
who
refused
to
participate
could
be
disciplined
and
expelled.
therefore,
in
the
lower
court
decision,
in
the
first
case
which
was
the
trial
under
that
particular
compulsory
statute
which
contained
that
provision,
the
judge
said
that
since
a
teacher
knows
that
he
may
be
expelled
or
may
be
dismissed,
it's
--
to
his
advantage
to
assemble
--
convince
the
children
to
listen.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
no.
what
the
court
below
meant
was
this,
that
since
the
--
the
court
reasoned
that
if
the
teacher
knows
that
he
must
conduct
this
ser
--
i
don't
agree
with
what
the
court
held,
but
this
is
what
i
understand
them
to
say,
if
the
teacher
knows
he
is
required
to
participate
in
this
service,
therefore
he
knows
the
state
likes
to
serve
it,
therefore
he
is
going
to
make
certain
the
children
are
attentive
and
listening
when
the
ceremony
is
conducted.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
alright.
that's
what
they
call
it.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
well
that's
--
and
then
in
fact
there
is
no
teacher
complaining
here
which
i
think
is
the
short
answer
to
the
question.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
thank
you,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
that
is
what
i
was
trying
to
say
and
that
is
what
(voice
overlap)
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
well,
they
required
enthusiasm
in
abington.
but
the
essential
part
of
the
lower
courts
decision
in
the
first
compulsory
statute
was
--
as
i
understand
the
compulsion
that
every
child
had
to
attend.
in
other
words,
it
was
a
concern
then
to
what
reading
a
certain
passage
from
the
bible
might
be
on
a
jewish
child's
mind,
but
he
knew
a
jewish
child
had
to
be
there.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
eighth
finding
of
fact
of
the
first
decision
which
is
at
page
194
of
the
record,
was
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
children
had
to
be
present
and
that
they
were
compelled
to
be
present
at
the
bible
reading
ceremony.
so
the
decree
held
that,
the
first
decree
held
that
we
could
not
read
the
bible
pursuant
to
the
statute
or
otherwise
except
that
we
always
can
use
any
book,
this
decree
said.
we
can
use
any
book
we
want
in
the
schools
of
abington
as
a
reference
or
as
a
source,
as
a
material
for
study.
in
other
words,
they
weren't
banning
the
bible
per
se
from
abington.
they
mentioned
nothing
of
the
lord's
prayer
in
the
first
decree.
following
this
decree,
we
immediately
found
notice
of
appeal
with
this
court.
prior
to
the
time,
our
jurisdictional
statement
was
filed
with
this
court,
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
amended
the
bible
reading
act
to
provide
that
any
child
could
be
excused
from
the
bible
reading,
from
participating
or
being
there
upon
a
written
request
of
his
parent
or
guardian
and
also
eliminated
from
the
statute,
that
particular
language
about
the
teacher
having
to
be
enthusiastic
as
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
that
was
stricken
out.
we
--
this
court
then,
the
supreme
court,
they
catered
the
judgment
and
remanded
our
case
back
to
the
three-judge
district
court
for
further
action
appropriate
in
light
of
the
amendment
to
the
bible-reading
statute.
thereafter,
the
three-judge
court
allowed
the
schempps
to
amend
their
complaint
by
eliminating
the
name
of
ellory,
who
had
been
graduating
and
by
simply
substituting
the
new
statute.
a
trial
was
held
under
the
amended
statute,
and
at
that
trial,
the
testimony
was
as
follows,
doctor
--
mr.
schempp,
the
father,
testified
that
he
was
familiar
with
new
excused
provision
but
that
he
had
not
elect
to
have
his
child
--
his
children
excused
because
he
thought
if
he
did,
if
he
asked
them
to
be
excused,
the
other
children
would
consider
his
children
odd
balls,
as
a
word
he
used,
different.
i
think
communists
or
immoral,
the
word
from
the
record
but
in
any
event,
different.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
no,
he
did
not.
he
testified
--
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
no.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
no,
all
we
know
is
that
he
believes
that
had
they
been
excused
--
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
that
is
all
we
have
on
it.
he
was
follow
--
he
also
described,
what
he
said
were
the
mechanics
of
bible-reading
in
abington.
he
described
how
it
worked
but
he
admitted
he
had
never
been
there.
he
had
never
talked
to
the
teacher
about
it.
he
never
talked
about
the
excused
provision.
his
son
follow
--
roger
followed
him
to
the
stand
and
said
that
his
father
had
correctly
described
the
practice
at
abington
or
the
objections
of
abington,
the
appellants,
the
court
also
admitted
into
this
second
trial,
all
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
taken
in
the
first
trial
under
the
compulsory
statute.
we
believe
then
and
we
believe
now
that
testimony
concerning
a
compulsory
statute
where
a
child
has
to
listen,
has
no
effect
in
--
is
irrelevant
in
a
trial
where
a
child
may
absent
himself
but
we
--
this,
the
issues
in
this
bible
case
transcend
any
problem
of
admissibility
of
evidence
so
we
do
not
make
that
argument
now.
as
a
result
of
the
second
trial,
the
lower
court's
decision
was
that
the
amended
statute
and
that
is
as
you
recall
the
statute
requires
--
provides
to
be
excused
was
an
establishment
of
religion.
it
said
that
bible-reading
followed
by
the
lord's
prayer
is
devotional.
it
said
that
the
excuse
is
no
help
because
the
practice
is
still
held
everyday,
that
the
bible
was
a
christian
document.
it
didn't
--
this
is
the
court's
decision
with
which
we
are
now
appealing
did
not
deal
with
the
free
exercise
clause
because
it's
said
it
was
unnecessary
to
pass
on
the
contentions
of
the
schempps
concerning
free
exercise,
because
we
find
this
is
an
establishment
of
religion.
it
said
that
this
case
is
really
governed,
falls
right
within
mccollum.
that
the
facts
are
essentially
the
same
and
the
decree
that
was
issued
enjoins
us,
as
i
have
said
from
reading
the
bible
pursuant
to
the
statute,
either
in
conjunction
with
or
not
in
conjunction
with
saying
the
lord's
prayer.
the
decree
also
says
that
we
can
use
any
book
in
the
schools
or
religious
source
--
for
educational
source.
he
almost
filed
probable
jurisdiction
noted
and
we
are
here
today.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
no,
we
obtained
to
stay
until
the
action
of
this
court.
what
is
this
bible
reading
practice?
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
the
--
in
the
second
decision
--
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
before
us
now,
the
court
said
it
need
not
pass
on
the
free
exer
--
the
contingencies
made
on
the
free
exercise
because
we
find
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause.
now,
what
is
this
particular
practice
with
which
the
schempps
--
to
which
they
object?
now,
although
the
public
school
bible-reading
practice
in
pennsylvania
is
an
old
one,
we
know
from
the
records
that
it
was
old
in
the
1860's.
it
first
became
statutory
in
1913
and
the
amendment
to
that
act
said,
“the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
bring
lessons
of
morality
to
the
school
children
during
their
school
days.”
since
that
time,
it's
been
continuously
required
by
the
statute.
at
abington,
this
is
the
way
it
works,
between
8:15
and
8:30
on
every
school
day,
all
the
children
in
their
homerooms,
advisory
sections,
there's
a
public
address
system
in
each
of
their
room.
at
8:15,
the
morning
exercise
starts.
first,
they
have
what's
called
an
introduction,
a
fact
for
the
day.
they
pull
something
out
of
the
world
almanac
to
gain
the
attention
of
the
children.
mt.
everest
is
29,000
feet
high,
something
like
that
to
get
them
thinking.
this
is
followed
by
10
verses
of
the
bible,
read
without
comment
--
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
the
almanac
comes
first.
it's
an
attention
gatherer.
this
has
followed
--
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
sir?
yes,
this
is
followed
or
the
10
verses
of
the
bible
is
followed
by
the
lord's
prayer
which
in
turn
is
followed
by
the
flag
salute,
which
in
turn
is
followed
by
the
school
announcements
for
the
day.
the
botany
class
will
meet
in
room
a
instead
of
room
b.
then
you
have
a
conclusion
at
which
they
announce
the
children
who
read
the
preceding
announcement.
these
announcements,
this
reading
of
the
fact
of
the
day,
the
bible,
the
prayer,
are
done
by
the
children
of
the
--
the
students
of
the
television
and
the
radio
workshop
which
is
a
regular
course
of
the
english
department
at
abington.
there
are
about
30
students
in
this
course
and
it's
voluntary.
the
bibles
--
these
chil
--
these
students
read,
the
--
excuse
me
--
the
abington
only
supplies
one
bible.
it
purchases
one
bible
which
is
the
king
james
version.
these
students
who
read
the
bible
or
in
this
course
of
30
people
are
encouraged
to
read
their
own
bibles
and
the
record
shows
the
testimony
to
the
effect
that
the
king
james
version
has
been
read,
the
revised
standard
version
has
been
read,
the
jewish
holy
scriptures
had
been
read
and
the
douay
version
has
been
read.
the
selection
of
the
verses
to
be
read
is
completely
up
to
the
child.
this
is
the
practice
that
the
schempps
are
complaining
about,
10
verses
of
the
bible
read
by
one
child
to
another.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart
there
is
a
room
at
which
the
radio
and
tv
class
meets.
that
is
where
the
little
broadcasting
affair
is
and
then
the
children
participate
there,
those
that
have
been
selected
to
read.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
it's
the
only
one
that
is
a
subject
to
this
suit
sir,
the
abington
high
school
and
that
is
where
both
of
these
children
are.
roger
and
donna
are
seniors
in
that
school.
this
is
the
way
it
is
carried
out
--
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
in
this
school.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
the
only
thing
that
--
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
what
would
happen,
except
this
mr.
schempp
testified.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
yes.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
but
he
testified
that
a
child
might
be
made
to
stand
outside
the
classroom
but
that
is
as
you
say
is
subjective
testimony.
there
is
no
--
the
situation
is
never
a
reason,
therefore
there
is
no
--
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
because
no
one
asked
to
be
excused.
what
are
the
schempps
really
complaining
about?
it's
not
the
bible
itself
because
--
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
h.
ward
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
on
page
16
of
their
brief,
the
plan
--
the
schempps
make
the
argument
that
they
have
no
objections
of
the
bible
being
used
in
the
schools
as
part
of
a
pedagogical
source
material.
they're
like
the
court
below,
the
court
has
always
said,
we
are
not
preventing
you
from
using
the
bible
in
the
schools,
what
the
plaintiffs
say
is
they
don't
like
the
way
we
are
using
the
bible.
they
say
we
are
not
in
fact
teaching
morality,
bringing
lessons
of
morals
to
the
children
although
that's
what
the
statute
says
we're
doing
and
that
is
what
we
contend
we're
doing.
the
schempps
say
we
are
not
doing
that.
how
could
we
be
teaching
moral?
