mr.
phillip
h.
ward
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
close
yesterday,
i
was
dealing
with
the
problem
what
are
the
schempp's
complaining
about?
first,
they're
not
complaining
that
we're
using
the
bible
in
the
school.
they
have
said
in
their
brief
that
they're
not
complaining
that
the
fact
that
the
bible
is
being
used,
they
say
what
they
complain
about
is
the
way
it's
being
used.
this
is
consistent
with
the
two
decrees
of
the
court,
never
has
the
court
said
that
we
cannot
use
the
bible
in
the
school.
consequently,
the
problem
here
is
how
do
we
use
the
bible
in
the
school?
we
say
and
the
statute
says
to
bring
lessons
of
morality
to
the
children.
the
schempps
say,
“no,
you
can't
be
doing
this.
how
can
you
teach
anything?
how
can
you
bring
lessons
of
morality
to
the
children?
how
is
it
a
proper
way
to
teach
if
you
only
use
one
source,”
we
only
use
one
book,
“if
you
don't
allow
any
comment
to
be
made
on
what,
what
is
being
read?
if
you
don't
select
particular
passages
that
are
unusually
good,”
they
say,
“this
can't
be
teaching
morality.”
they
say,
“you're
not
teaching
morality.
what
in
fact
you're
doing,”
they
say,
“is
you
are
teaching
some
kind
of
a
public
school
creed,
it
doesn't
have
religion
that's
cut
adrift
from
theology.”
on
page
29
of
their
brief,
in
the
second
paragraph
they
say,
and
they're
talking
about
the
bible
reading
practice,
they
say,
“the
result
is
to
foster
a
kind
of
colorless
national
or
public
school
creed,
a
religiosity
without
religion,
a
sanctimonious
eclecticism
cut
adrift
from
theology.”
and
gentlemen,
that
is
precisely
what
we're
doing.
we
are
teaching
morality
without
religion
cut
adrift
from
theology,
and
that
is
proper
for
the
people
of
pennsylvania.
we
can
bring
to
our
children
the
lessons
of
morality
in
their
school
days
as
long
as
we're
not
bringing
religion,
not
bringing
theology.
the
people
of
pennsylvania
have
wanted
to
do
this.
they
have
--
since
the
beginning,
wanted
to
bring
these
lessons
of
morality
to
the
children.
so
what
did
they
do?
they
picked
a
common
source
of
morality,
the
bible.
they
could
have
picked
two
sources,
ten
sources,
a
hundred
sources,
but
they
didn't.
in
their
wisdom,
they
picked
the
bible.
in
order
that
only
the
morals
would
be
taught.
in
order
to
keep
out
any
possibility
of
theology,
of
doctrines
sneaking
in,
they
say
it
shall
be
read
without
comment.
they
say
we
shall
not
pick
certain
particular
passages.
they
didn't
want
any
possibility
of
any
sectarian
or
religious
instruction.
now,
perhaps
the
result
is
as
the
schempp
say,
it's
colorless.
i
don't
know
what
a
colorless
creed
is
or
what
a
colorful
creed
is.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
that's
quite
correct,
sir.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
we
excuse
them
from
the
flag
salute,
sir
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
--
and
that
is
teaching
patriotism.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
why?
i
don't
know
how
is
the
best
way
to
teach
morality,
sir.
perhaps
you
teach
morality
in
a
different
way
than
you
teach
history,
but
i
think
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
--
i
think
it
is
consistent
in
this
respect,
sir.
the
provision
for
teaching
morality,
i
believe
the
requirement
for
the
excuse
is
not
absolutely
necessary
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
--
this
particular
practice.
i
think
the
fact
that
we
teach
it
in
this
way,
maybe
it's
not
the
best
way,
maybe
we
shouldn't
excuse
the
children,
but
it's
the
way
that
people
of
pennsylvania
picked
out
and
as
long
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
well,
no.
in
pennsylvania,
we
also
excuse
children
if
they
want
to
be
from
a
physical
and
dental
examination
if
they
have
any
religious
compunction
about
taking
that.
i
think,
here
is
a
situation
we
want
to
teach
morality.
we
think
it's
a
good
thing.
we
do
it
in
a
different
way
than
we
teach
other
subjects
perhaps
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
certainly.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
think
it
might
well
be.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
it
could.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
we
have
other
electives.
it's
not
in
the
record
but
like
the
children
who
take
the
television
and
radio
workshop
that
are
the
ones
that
read
this,
i
know
can
take
it
or
cannot.
but
my
point
is
this,
pennsylvania
has
decided
this
is
the
way
it
wants
to
teach
morality.
i
agree
with
the
schempps
that
it
is
without
religion,
it
has
cut
adrift
from
theology.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
sir.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
the
bible
as
we
all
agree
is
a
monumental
doctrine.
it
has
religious
values,
moral
values,
historical
values,
literally
right.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
am
taking
the
position
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
the
pennsylvania
--
that's
exactly
what
i
say,
sir.
we
are
teaching
the
morality
in
the
bible.
we
might
have
used
the
qur'an
if
we
thought
that
was
the
proper
source
of
morality.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
it
is
a
great
religious
document
and
it
has
other
values.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
don't
--
sir,
when
i
read
the
bible,
i
may
get
one
feeling
when
you
read
it
another,
or
the
third
person.
what
i
say
is
the
bible
is
of
value
to
the
atheist
who
doesn't
believe,
or
to
the
agnostic.
the
morality,
the
lessons,
the
history,
the
beauty
of
the
bible
can
mean
something
wholly
apart
from
religion.
that's
--
that
is
why
the
bible
is
such
a
monumental
work
that
it
has
this
ability
and
that
is
what
we're
using.
and
again,
the
schempps
say
that
this
case,
the
establishment
of
religion
is
exactly
the
same
as
we
find
in
engle
and
vitale.
they
say
that
this
case
is
like
engle
and
vitale,
but
the
difference
between
a
suggestion
of
the
state,
the
children
say
a
prayer,
a
solemn
of
avowal
of
faith,
and
the
suggestion
that
children
listen
to
ten
verses
of
the
bible
is
a
complete
difference
in
kind.
suggesting
that
the
children
say
a
prayer
is
suggesting
they
engage
in
a
purely
religious
act.
a
prayer
has
no
secular
value.
the
prayer
assumes
that
the
child
believes
in
an
almighty,
that
the
almighty
can
hear
him
and
may
help
him.
that
is
when
you
suggest
to
a
child
to
say
a
prayer.
what
are
we
suggesting?
we
are
suggesting
that
children
listen
to
ten
verses
of
a
monumental
work
which
as
mr.
justice
goldberg
says
is
a
great
religious
work,
but
in
addition,
it
is
a
source
of
moral
values.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
i'm
not
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
i'm
saying
that
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
sir.
i
respectfully
suggest
it's
not.
a
person
could
be
excused
from
listening
to
the
bible.
maybe
that
person
believes
so
profoundly
in
the
bible
that
they
only
want
their
children
to
hear
it
read
liturgically,
that
person
might
want
the
child
excused.
the
second
person
might
be
an
atheist
who
thinks
it's
all
a
bunch
of
myths
and
doesn't
want
their
child
confused.
that
person
might
want
their
child
excused.
a
third
person
might
be
neutral
about
religion
but
might
say,
“i
don't
want
my
child
to
hear
certain
of
the
gory
passages
in
the
bible.”
that
child
might
be
excused.
consequently
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
certainly.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
they
may
be
excused
just
like
pennsylvania
believes
it's
proper
to
salute
the
flag
but
those
who
don't
want
to,
don't
have
to.
now,
maybe
the
family
doesn't
want
their
child
to
be
patriotic,
they
have
the
right.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
the
act
of
the
excuse,
the
act
of
the
excuse
signifies
nothing.
it
doesn't
signify
whether
you're
a
religious
person,
a
nonreligious
person,
it
doesn't
signify
any
belief.
that
is
what
the
schempps
argue
that
the
provision
for
excuse
in
fact
makes
them
make
a
public
profession
of
belief.
it
says,
this
is
telling
all
the
world,
this
is
a
public
profession
of
belief.
that
isn't
in
this
case,
all
the
parent
has
to
do
is
say,
“i
don't
want
my
child
to
be
present
when
the
bible
is
being
read.”
for
the
reasons,
i've
just
given
the
chief
justice
their
many
reasons
why
the
child
should
not
or
may
be
excused.
i
think
what
the
schempps
are
objecting
to
is
they
have
to
do
something.
i
think
they're
saying,
“why
should
i
have
to
do
something
to
get
my
child
out
of
it?”
well
gentlemen,
the
jehovah's
witness
parent
has
to
do
something
to
have
their
child
excused
from
the
flag
salute.
the
catholic
parent
has
to
do
something
to
send
their
children
to
parochial
schools.
the
man
who
takes
the
fifth
amendment
has
to
do
something.
i
don't
think
it's
unconstitutional
to
require
them
to
do
something.
then
again,
the
schempps
say,
“what
this
does
is
this
separates
the
children.
it's
divisive.
it
separates
our
children
from
the
others.
they
will
be
different.
they
will
be
unbold.”
they
will
be
different
because
this
separates
the
children
from
those
who
want
to
be
present
when
the
bible
is
being
read
from
those
who
don't
want
to
be
present.
it
doesn't
separate
them
as
catholic
and
protestant
or
jew
and
atheist.
an
atheist
may
well
want
to
hear
the
bible.
they
may
well
get
moral
lessons
out
of
the
bible.
a
developed
christian
may
well
not
want
to
hear
the
bible.
it
separates
them
and
they
are
different,
but
not
different
according
to
their
religion.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
i
don't
mean
that
sir.
i
don't
mean
that.
i
mean,
they're
separate
in
this
way.
they're
separate
as
the
child
that's
been
excused
from
the
flag
salute
is
separate.
they're
separate
as
the
conscientious
objectors
separate
from
those
who
serve.
they
are
separate
as
the
child
who
goes
to
parochial
school
is
separate
from
the
child
who
doesn't.
that's
the
glory
of
the
country
they
can
be
separated.
they
have
the
right
to
be
separate.
there
are
only
two
places
where
they
would
all
be
the
same.
one
of
course
would
be
a
totalitarian
state
where
we
couldn't
be
different;
and
two
would
be
some
sort
of
big
togetherness
state
where
we
never
did
anything
unless
everybody
wanted
to
do
that
very
same
thing.
and
of
course,
they're
not
many
things
that
everybody
wants
to
do.
then
the
schempp's
say
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
sir.
this
is
not
the
vitale.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
vitale
was
suggesting
that
the
children
do
a
purely
religious
act.
vitale
was
suggesting
that
the
children
each
morning
say
in
fact,
“i
believe
in
god.
i
want
him
to
bless
my
teachers
and
the
school.”
there's
no
meaning
to
a
prayer
unless
there
is
a
reli
--
it's
a
purely
religious
doctrine,
a
purely
religious
act.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
sir,
we
are
not,
in
this
case,
i
am
arguing
for
the
bible
reading
statute.
the
lord's
prayer
is
a
custom
at
abington
but
it's
not
a
subject
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
sir.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
it
is
done
but
it
is
not
part
of
the
statute
of
pennsylvania.
in
other
words,
the
statute
of
pennsylvania
requires
only
the
ten
verses
of
the
bible
be
read
every
morning.
it
is
a
custom
at
abington
to
follow
that
by
a
recitation
of
the
lord's
prayer.
the
injunction
against
us
says
that
if
we
just
do
the
statutory
method,
just
the
bible,
we
are
unconstitutional.
if
we
do
it,
the
bible
and
the
prayer
were
unconstitutional.
consequently,
this
court
must
concern
itself
with
the
bible
because
if
that
is
unconstitutional,
you
don't
have
to
bother
with
lord's
prayer.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
there's
a
distinct
difference,
sir,
i
suggest.
in
other
words,
the
lord's
prayer
appears
in
luke
and
in
matthew.
when
it's
read
to
them
from
the
bible,
it
is
an
explanation
and
historical
account
of
how
jesus
taught
us
to
pray.
i
think
that
is
different
than
suggesting
to
the
children
say
this
prayer,
and
as
an
analogy
to
point
out
the
difference,
suppose
i
lived
in
baghdad
and
my
son
phil
went
to
a
school
there,
some
muhammad
nation.
and
he
gets
to
school
every
morning,
they
read
ten
verses
from
the
qur'an.
and
one
morning,
he
gets
there
and
they
read,
and
then
muhammad
gathered
his
tribes
and
warriors
around
him
and
said,
“this
is
the
way
you
shall
pray.
there
is
no
god,
but
god
and
allah
is
his
prophet.”
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
and
sir,
i'm
trying
to
explain
the
difference
between
reading
a
prayer
as
part
of
the
text
in
the
bible,
and
suggesting
to
the
children
that
they
say
the
prayer.
i
would
think
it
would
be
entirely
different
if
--
as
i
am
describing
the
qur'an
says,
this
is
how
muhammad
said
to
pray,
“then
if
every
morning
that
my
son
goes
there
and
they
start
by
saying,
“there
is
no
god
but
god,
and
allah
is
his
prophet.”
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
sir,
that's
the
name
of
the
bible.
the
douay
version
is
the
holy
bible
or
the
revised
standard
version
is
called
the
holy
bible.
the
king
james
versions
is
called
the
holy
bible.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
sir,
the
--
all
the
bibles
i
have
seen
are
called
the
holy
bible,
the
jewish
holy
scriptures
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
but
the
holy
bible
is
the
--
the
generic
for
this
particular
book.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
it's
not
so
much
whether
they
speak
or
whether
they
don't
speak.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
don't
think
that
is,
that
maybe
bad
on
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
mr.
justice
white,
i
didn't
quite
understand
if
instead
of
reading
the
bible
all
the
children
have
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
think
if
they
required,
that'd
be
bad
under
the
barnette
case.
i
don't
think
we
can
require
people
to
say
anything.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
yes.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
he
can
require,
i
think
that
was
defining
the
barnette
case.
it
wasn't
so
much,
it
was
a
religious
act.
it
was
--
there's
the
first
amendment
prevents
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
yes.
now,
in
addition,
the
schempps
say
in
this
case
and
as
did
the
court
below
fall
squarely
within
mccollum.
here
again,
you
have
an
entirely
different
situation
because
in
mccollum,
you
were
dealing
with
the
purely
religious
act,
pure
sectarian
instruction,
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
the
school
is
making
possible
and
in
the
sense
suggesting
to
the
children
that
they
either
go
to
one
of
the
three
religious
teaching
classes,
that's
not
here.
mccollum,
zorach,
all
of
these
cases
deal
with
a
purely
religious
act.
here,
comparing
one
child
reading
over
the
public
address
system
of
the
other
children,
ten
verses
of
the
bible
cannot
compare
with
the
admitted
religious
instruction
in
mccollum.
again
in
tudor,
the
schempps
mentioned
the
tudor
case
might
have
an
effect.
in
tudor,
we
were
dealing
with
the
gideon
bible.
the
gideon
bible
is
the
new
testament,
the
psalms
and
the
proverbs
from
the
old
testament.
the
gideon
bible
is
a
distributed
by
the
gideon
society
which
is
an
admitted
christian
evangelical
organization.they
are
trying
to
bring
men
to
christ.
this
would
be
helping
a
religious
group
to
distribute
their
pamphlets.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
think
it
would,
sir.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
would
think
it
would,
sir.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
think
there
you
were
suggesting
that
a
child
make
a
purely
religious
act.
you're
suggesting
that
he
repeat
--
i
think
it's
like
engle
and
vitale.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
but
barnette
case
--
i
don't
think
went
on
the
religious
part.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
well,
i
think
because
of
the
nature
of
a
prayer,
i
think
the
prayer
in
engle
and
vitale,
and
any
prayer,
to
me,
has
no
secular
meaning.
it's
a
purely
religious
act
and
i
think
it's
certainly
can't
be
required.
and
i
think
even
suggesting
that
children
do
it,
there
may
be
a
compulsion
on
the
child,
he
may
feel
he
should
do
it
and
i
don't
think
the
constitution
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
well,
this
is
a
hypothetical
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
may
well
be
constitutional?
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
and
i
get
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
oh
no.
i
think
as
i
understand
your
question,
mr.
justice
black,
if
--
do
i
think
that
no
child
is
sort
of
compelled
by
the
fact
that
all
the
rest
do
something?
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
oh
no.
i
certainly
think
children
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
oh
certainly.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
i
think
there,
there
may
well
be.
i
think
there's
pressure
on
the
child
that's
excused
from
the
flag
salute.
i
think
maybe
his
little
friend
say,
“why
don't
you
salute
the
flag?”
i
think
the
child
that
doesn't
go
to
the
school
dance
they
might
say,
“why
do
you
do
this?”
i
think
undoubtedly
there
is
this
difference.
i
think
there's
nothing
we
could
do
about
a
difference.
and
i
think
there
is
a
general
pattern
of
conformity
but
in
our
case,
there
is
no
conform
--
no
pattern
to
make
the
child
do
a
religious
act.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
sir
that
we
say,
our
statute
says,
our
--
the
testimony
of
our
witnesses
in
the
school
say
that
we
are
using
the
bible
to
bring
lessons
in
morality
to
the
children.
we
admit
the
bible
has
a
great
religious
value.
it
has
a
great
religious
history.
it's
obviously
an
original,
a
religious
document
but
we
say
in
addition
to
that
it
is
a
source
of
morality
for
western
civilization
that
we
have
adopted;
that
the
morals
in
it
are
what
we
want
actually
to
find
and
we
think
by
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
think
we
adopted
it.
i
think
the
morality
--
it's
a
morality
we
understand
suppose,
would
we
adopt
the
qur'an?
may
i
speak
to
that
for
a
moment?
i
think
pennsy
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
well
sir,
i
didn't
mean
if
we
were
mohammedans.
i
meant
would
pennsylvania,
is
it
likely
they
might
have
adopted
as
they
source
of
morality,
the
qur'an.
and
i
think
wholly
apart
i
don't
think
it's
the
religious
reason.
i
think
it's
weird,
nobody
at
least
in
pennsylvania
were
not
too
familiar
with
the
qur'an.
what
are
the
moral
--
is
it
a
source
of
morality?
the
one
thing
i
know
about
the
qur'an
is
it
says
that
you
should
have
no
more
than
four
wives.
that
would
be
a
doubtless
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
know.
i've
never
heard
of
it
and
i
don't
think
it
ever
would
happen
because
we
don't
consider
the
qur'an
the
supreme
source
of
morality
that
we
consider
the
bible.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
we
don't
know
anything
about
it.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
well,
i
mean
i've
been
exposed
to
a
little
education.
i
don't
know
too
much.
as
i
said
the
one
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
mr.
justice
black,
it
is
that
and
so
much
more.
it's
so
much
a
part
of
the
tradition
of
this
country
and
the
morality
of
the
country.
it's
our
sort.
i
mean,
you
can't
say
that
morals
only
spring
from
religion.
the
atheist
can
be
a
moral
man.
the
agnostic
is
a
moral
man.
morals
are
so
--
the
morals
in
the
bible
are
not
so
deeply
based
on
the
christian-judaic
concept
that
they
can't
be
separated.
certainly
we
can't
claim
--
the
christians
and
the
jews
can't
claim
that
the
morals
that
are
in
the
bible
as
our
own
particular
document
that
they're
only
ours.
we
can
teach
morality
and
we
think
that
the
best
place
to
get
morality
for
our
system
in
pennsylvania
is
to
use
a
book
that
we
--
everyone's
familiar
with.
everybody
approves
those
moral.
when
i
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
the
vast
majority.
if
--
if
were
everybody
saying,
“we
want
to
pick
this
as
our
religious
book”,
that
would
be
bad.
we
can't
pick
a
religious
book.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
the
pennsyl
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
that
is
exactly
it,
sir.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
the
assumption
is
--
that
is
what
we're
doing.
the
people
of
pennsylvania
believed
that
the
religion
that
must
be
got
at
the
home
and
schools,
at
the
sunday
school.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
think
that
is
why
i
said
when
i
opened
this
case
that
the
--
it's
a
noble
question.
the
bible
has
religious
values.
we
all
admit
that.
we
all
know
that.
the
question
is,
can
the
people
of
pennsylvania
use
this
source
of
morality
to
bring
lessons
of
morality
to
their
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
well,
are
you
--
mr.
justice
black,
are
you
asking
me
do
the
people
of
pennsylvania
do
it
because
it
is
a
religious
doctrine?
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no,
sir.
our
position
is
they
don't.
our
position
is
that
they,
of
course,
appreciate
the
bible
but
in
their
schools,
they
are
bringing
lessons
of
morality
if
they
wanted
to
bring
the
religious
part.
we
would
have
comment.
we
have
picked
the
particular
passages.
we
would
have
--
i
mean
if
we're
going
to
teach
religion,
we
could
do
it
in
a
different
way.
our
ques
--
our
argument
here
is
here
is
a
traditional
practice
that
in
the
absence
of
the
fact
of
the
bible
has
religious
connotations,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
what
we
are
arguing
is
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
certainly
would,
sir.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
would
agree
with
that
completely.
and
i
also
state
that
here,
the
state
is
not
forcing
religion.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
think
as
the
case
before
us
now
ten
verses
is
acceptable.
i
think,
i
agree
with
you,
chief
justice,
it
could
become
so
bad
that
you
couldn't
--
reasonable
men
couldn't
say
they
are
teaching
morality.
they
would
have
to
say,
they
are
doing
nothing
but
using
the
bible
to
indoctrinate
those
children
with
religion.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
think
that
would
be
a
question
of
fact.
i
would
think
an
hour
taken
out
of
the
school
day
for
morality
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
“morality
is
a
very
important
thing
to
teach.”
i
don't
know.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
don't
know.
i
know
if
the
people
of
pennsylvania
think
that's
a
good
way
to
teach
morality,
i
think
the
problem
would
be
for
the
court
to
determine.
in
fact,
could
we
as
reasonable
men
believe
that
pennsylvania
is
really
trying
to
teach
morality
or
by
this
tremendous
emphasis
on
the
bible,
they
are
in
fact
trying
to
teach
religion?
i
think
that
the
question
that
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
it's
exactly
our
problem
today,
sir.
and
i
--
and
i
are
obviously
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
think
you
can
sum
up
our
particular
problem
as
this.
can
you
use
--
can
you
keep
a
tradition
which
has
secular
values?
it
does
teach
morality.
it
is
non-compulsory.
the
child
doesn't
have
to
be
there.
but
the
only
problem
is
that
it
is
--
it
involves
part
of
the
religious
tradition
of
this
country.
it
deals
with
the
document
that
is
of
obvious
religious
origin
and
to
many
people
an
obviously
religious
book.
can
you
use
the
great
values
that
are
in
the
bible
or
is
--
does
the
constitution
mean,
which
i
respectfully
say,
it
does
not
mean
that
despite
the
fact
that
nobody
is
forced
to
believe
or
disbelieve
anything.
nobody
is
forced
to
contribute
to
support.nobody
is
indoctrinated
despite
the
fact
that
this
custom
doesn't
do
any
of
those
things
must
the
government
ripped
out
that
doctrine,
that
tradition,
simply
because
it
involves
a
religious
book.
must
the
government
any
time,
any
tradition
in
any
way,
reflects
the
fact
that
we
are
a
religious
people?
must
say
rip
out
any
tradition
even,
even
if
that
tradition
nobody
has
to
abide
by?
the
tradition
isn't
trying
to
teach
anybody
anything.
the
tradition
isn't
requiring
a
person
to
believe
or
disbelieve.
the
tradition
has
secular
value.
it
has
a
purpose
like
sunday
closing.
it
has
a
purpose
to
teach
morality
to
the
children.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
think
had
pennsylvania
decided
that
was
a
good
way
to
teach
morality,
it
would
be
constitutional
but
this
is
what
i
think.
i
think
it
is
--
pennsylvania
would
have
--
the
people
of
pennsylvania
may
have
decided
by
selecting
certain
particular
sermons,
certain
particular
tracks.sectarianism
could
creep
in.
in
other
words,
how
do
you
really
find
any
volume
and
monumental
work
for
a
source
of
morality
such
as
the
bible,
and
that's
why
the
bible
is
used.
that's
--
it's
here
for
us
to
use.
taking
the
sermons,
i
think
if
pennsylvania
decided
that
was
the
way
to
do
it,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
you
correctly
stated
the
first
part
of
our
argument
that
we
say
this
is
not
a
religious
act,
therefore,
it's
constitutional.
if
you
hold
that
it
is
a
religious
act,
i
think
it
falls
within
that
body
of
tradition
that
we
have
that
is
like
“in
god
we
trust”
in
the
coins,
like
starting
this
court
with
“god
save
this
honorable
court”,
i
don't
think
it
is
--
it
rises
to
that
dignity,
that
type
of
religious
act.
i
think
the
religious
act
in
engle
where
it
was
actually
a
prayer,
where
the
children
were
required
to
make
an
avowal
of
faith.
that
is,
i
distinguish
in
this
case
i
distinguish
the
kind
of
religious
act
that
was
suggested
in
mccollum
because
that
was
pure
religious
indoctrination.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
can
see
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
yes.
i
can
see
if
this
court
determines
that
our
ten
verses
of
the
bible
is
the
same
nature
as
in
engle
and
vitale
requiring
the
children
to
say
they
believe
in
god.
yes,
i
think
under
engle
and
vitale,
you
have
to
clarify.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
yes.
yes,
and
i
--
i
respectfully
submit
it
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
it
does
not.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
no.
i
think
our
case
is
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
i
would
say
you
should
if
you
find
that
this
kind
of
an
act
that
we
are
doing
which
is
i
say
is
sec
--
has
secular
values,
is
traditional
but
in
some
way
reflects
the
religious
tradition
of
this
country.
if
that
is
unconstitutional
because
of
vitale,
then
i
--
i
suggest
you
have
to
reexamine
vitale.
i
don't
think
our
case
is
anywhere
near
vitale.
and
i
don't
think
that's
what
vitale
held.
in
addition
to
the
foregoing
argument,
we
also
would
like
to
suggest
that
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
that
don't
have
standings
to,
we've
even
not
--
even
concern
ourselves
with
the
constitutionality
under
the
doctrine.
mr.
justice
--
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
may
i
allow
the
attorney
--
deputy
attorney
general
of
pennsylvania
to
make
a
final
statement,
sir.
mr.
phillip
h.
ward
thank
you.
