mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
is
--
i
understand
mr.
kerpelman,
this
--
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
do
not
propose
to
argue
any
further
this
time.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
state
that
the
respondents
do
not
intend
to
waive
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court
in
this
matter.
we
covered
this
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
granting
of
the
writ.
we
did
not
repeat
our
argument;
however,
in
the
brief
that
we
submitted
on
the
merits
of
the
case.
i
merely
say
that
by
way
of
passing.
i
understand
that
the
court
in
engel
has
in
effect,
indicated
that
the
court
does
have
jurisdiction
in
a
case
such
as
this.
simply
for
the
record,
i
would
merely
like
to
point
out
that
we
do
not
by
having
failed
to
mention
it
in
our
brief
on
the
merits
intend
to
waive
it.
now
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
doremus
case
held,
of
course,
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
there
was
no
violation
except
that
the
question
with
respect
to
the
individual
child's
rights
was
moot
because
the
child
had
then
graduated
from
the
school.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
child
is
still
in
the
school.
our
position
is
simply
this,
that
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
is
a
matter
of
decree.
in
other
words,
the
wall
of
separation
between
church
and
state
is
a
matter
of
decree.
it
is
not
an
absolute,
fixed,
finite
wall,
and
this
court
has
so
stated
on
several
occasions.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
zorach,
it
was
stated
that
when
you
get
into
the
question
of
the
separation
between
church
and
straight
--
state,
it
is
indeed
a
matter
of
decree.
and,
it
was
because
of
this
very
factor
that
this
court
in
everson
held
that
though
religious
exercises
or
religiousness
was
involved,
that
it
still
did
not
violate
sufficiently
the
establishment
clause
as
to
constitute
an
abridgment
of
that
clause.
the
same
was
true
in
mcgowan,
the
sunday
blue
law
cases.
the
court
in
that
case
held
that,
historically,
there
was
no
question
about
it
but
that
the
sunday
blue
laws
were
laws
which
were
established
for
the
benefit
of
religion,
from
the
day
of
rest,
to
keep
holy
the
sabbath
day.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
under
the
maryland
statute
in
mcgowan,
the
statute
provides
so
that
the
day
of
rest,
in
order
not
to
profane
the
lord's
day.
so,
we
have
this
question
of
religiousness
in
mcgowan,
but
this
court
stated
in
that
case
that
there
was
not
a
sufficient
degree
of
abridgment
of
religiousness,
so
to
speak,
as
to
violate
the
establishment
clause.
now
let's
go,
if
we
may,
to
the
case
at
bar.
this
is
the
murray
case.
it
is
true
that
the
rule
of
the
baltimore
city
schools
provide
that
there
shall
be
the
lord's
prayer
and
the
reading
of
passages
from
the
bible.
this
is
a
long
established
practice
which
goes
far
beyond
the
rule
itself.
historically,
it
will
be
--
it
can
be
shown,
were
there's
not
a
case
up
on
demurrer.
it
can
be
shown
that
the
practice
goes
back
at
least
as
far
as
1836
throughout
the
schools
of
maryland.
now,
the
practice,
we
maintain,
has
something
in
it
other
than
religiousness
itself.
it
is
true
that
the
lord's
prayer,
it
is
true
that
the
bible,
sounds
and
religion
has
its
roots
in
religion.
this,
we
do
not
deny.
we
point
out
however,
that
the
use
of
the
bible,
the
use
of
the
lord's
prayer
in
the
morning
exercises
has
a
significant
salutary
effect
in
several
respects.
first
of
all,
it
has
a
traditional
teaching
of
moral
and
ethical
values.
this,
i
believe
even
my
brother,
mr.
kerpelman,
admitted
when
he
stated
that
it
was
a
beautiful
prayer,
the
most
beautiful
prayer
ever
composed
or
at
least
many
people
believed
that
it
was,
that
the
literature
of
the
bible
was
historical
and
that
it
was
the
most
widely
read
book
of
all
books
ever
composed.
now
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
lord's
prayer
is
said
in
unison.
the
individual
child
who
conducts
the
opening
exercise
for
that
day
which
includes
not
only
the
prayer
but
the
salute
to
the
flag,
the
individual
child
would
probably
say
his
version
and
those
who
join
him
will
probably
say
their
version.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
is
recited
together.
now,
i
cannot
say
that
this
may
absolutely
be
true
in
every
school.
of
course,
we
have
no
record
in
this
case,
but
my
understanding
is
that
basically,
a
child
is
selected
for
the
particular
day
to
conduct
the
morning
exercises
and
then
everybody
recites
the
prayer
together.
they
can
say
their
version,
if
they
prefer
one,
or
they
can
say
nothing
even
if
they're
not
excused
or
do
not
wish
to
take
advantage
of
the
right
of
excuse.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
think
the
--
basically
the
king
james
version
is
the
one
that
is
used
most
often.
there's
of
course
provision
in
the
rule
itself
which
says
that
the
douay
version
may
be
used
by
those
who
prefer
it.
but
the
king
james
version,
i
believe,
is
the
one
that
is
used
in
most
instances.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
generally,
the
students
who
are
conducting
the
morning
exercises
will
read
passages
from
the
bible
as
they
will
also
start
the
lord's
prayer
and
start
the
salute
to
the
flag.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
never
--
there
is
an
assembly,
it
is
broadcasted
in
every
--
all
of
the
students
should
--
that
they
gather
and
is
done
in
unison
in
the
assembly.
in
some
of
the
schools,
i
believe,
it
is
broadcasted.
in
others,
i'm
not
sure.
i
believe
it
might
be
conducted
within
the
classroom
itself.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
in
each
individual
classroom.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
student,
generally,
is
the
one
who
conducts
the
opening
exercise.
now,
this
is
the
best
of
my
information.
of
course,
we
are
at
this
disadvantage
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
we
don't
have
a
record.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
because
it
came
up
on
demurrer.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
justice
douglas,
my
argument
would
not
change,
sir.
we
say
this,
that
the
school
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
doing
what
it
considers
proper
within
the
framework
of
the
school
system
to
develop
the
children
under
their
care.
the
school
then
has
the
right
to
make
a
reasonable
selection
as
to
what
it
thinks
will
do
both
in
the
way
of
the
courses
conducted
and
in
the
material
used
whether
it
be
in
history
or
whether
it
be
in
this
area
in
the
morning
exercises.
they
may
use,
for
instance,
the
hymn
america
instead
of
using
the
salute
to
the
flag.
they
may
use
the
king
james
version
or
the
duran
instead
of
using
the
douay
version.
our
position
is
that
this
is
a
matter
that
rest
within
the
discretion
of
the
school
authorities
and
unless
there
--
it
can
be
shown
that
this
constitutes
at
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause,
that
then
--
it
is
then
within
the
prerogative
of
the
school
to
do
that
which
they
think
is
proper
for
the
best
interest
of
the
children.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no.mr.
justice
douglas
was
inquiring
whether
or
not
my
view
would
be
the
same
or
my
argument
would
be
the
same
if
that
particular
version
could
be
used
or
if
that
reading
could
be
used.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
get
your
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
in
that
it
specifically
provides
that
it
may
be
used,
that
is,
the
douay
version
may
be
used.
it
might
be
construed
to
say
that
all
other
instruments
may
not
be
used.
i
don't
think
that's
a
proper
construction.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
doubt
very
seriously
whether
the
board
or
the
school
principal
would
so
construe
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
and/or
the
use
of
the
lord's
prayer.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
think
that
it
--
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
there
shall
be
a
complete,
strict
construction
of
that
particular
role,
then
maybe
it
cannot
be
used,
the
duran.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
in
the
opening
exercises.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
may
be
used
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
during
the
exercise
or
--
actually,
we
say
that
the
morning
exercises
are
not
there
for
religious
purpose.
now,
we
do
not
deny
that
maybe
they
began
because
historically,
if
you
go
back,
there
was
always
religion
in
the
schools
and,
of
course,
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why,
as
i
understand
it,
back
in
the
prerevolutionary
days,
the
schools
were
not
secular.
they
were
really
religious
schools.
this,
i
understand,
is
why
you
had
the
first
amendment,
the
establishment
clause,
so
that
they
could
not
have
religion
taught
in
school
as
religion
per
se.
now,
subsequently,
when
you
got
into
your
common
schools
and
your
public
school
system,
the
school
authorities,
although
not
required
to
by
rule
or
regulation,
as
a
matter
of
either
religiousness
at
that
particular
time
or
it's
the
combination
of
religiousness
plus
the
inculcation
of
these
moral
and
ethical
values
within
the
students,
decided
that
this
was
a
good
practice
for
the
benefit
of
the
whole
child.
beyond
that,
we
have
the
indication
in
the
brief
which
we
have
filed
that
dr.
brien,
the
superintendent
of
the
public
schools
of
baltimore
city,
has
indicated
that
these
exercises,
these
morning
exercises,
have
an
extremely
salutary
effect
upon
the
children
coming
into
the
school.
it
puts
them
in
a
frame
of
mind.
there
is
a
sobering
influence.
it
puts
them
in
a
frame
of
mind
when
they
can
approach
the
school
day
with
some
sobriety
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
we
have
a
respect
for
authority
--
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that's
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
dr.
brien
says
that
what
this
does,
it
establishes
a
discipline
tone.
it
establishes
a
respect
for
authority
and
it
also
has
the
value
of
giving
them
the
inculcation
of
moral
and
ethical
precepts.
this,
he
considers
to
be
a
very,
very
significant
effect
to
begin
the
school
day
with.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
our
position,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
this.
that
if
the
school
authorities
in
that
particular
jurisdiction
should
determine
that
morning
exercises
will
serve
a
significant
purpose
other
than
pure
religiousness
itself,
then
we
say
that
they
then
had
the
right
to
make
such
selection
of
material
as
the
school
authorities
in
that
instance
think
will
best
accomplish
that
purpose.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
that
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
they
could
do
that.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
the
purpose
is
not
to
teach
religion,
not
to
instruct
in
religion,
but
simply
to
set
the
tone
of
the
day
and
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
the
discipline
tone,
to
give
them
the
benefit
of
respect
for
authority
which
is
one
of
the
most
significant
things
that
is
needed
in
the
school
system
whether
it
be
secular,
whether
it
be
parochial,
whether
it
be
private.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
would
say
that
it
is
one
of
the
effects
of
the
exercise,
but
it
is
only
one
of
the
many
effects
of
the
exercise.
and,
as
long
as
there
is
a
purpose
which
can
be
served.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
justice
black
in
mcgowan
stated,
it
is
equally
true
that
the
establishment
clause
does
not
ban
federal
or
state
regulation
of
conduct
whose
reason
or
effect
merely
happens
to
coincide
or
harmonize
with
the
tenants
of
some
or
all
religions.
in
many
instances,
the
congress
or
state
legislatures
conclude
that
the
general
welfare
of
society,
wholly
apart
from
any
religious
considerations,
demands
such
regulation.
this
is
our
position.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
justice
harlan,
my
reading
of
mcgowan
indicates
to
me
that
the
court
recognized
that
there
was
a
mixture.
there
was
religiousness.
it
was
religious
in
its
origin.
it
had
not
been
completely
obliterated
the
religious
aspect,
but
that
there
was
this
other
civic
or
civil
purpose
that
was
to
be
accomplished.
and,
i
might
say
that
mcgowan
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
very
severe
penalty
imposed
upon
those
who
did
not
wish
to
abide
by
the
rule
and
even
going
down
to
the
latest
amendment
to
the
sunday
blue
laws
in
maryland
which
was
involved
in
mcgowan,
the
--
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
--
there
was
the
reference
in
there
that
it
was
to
prevent
profaning
the
lord's
day
which
indicates
the
religious,
undercurrent,
that
the
sunday
blue
laws
were
intended
to
effect.
and
true,
it
had
the
civil
aspect
to
it.
this
is
what
we
say.
as
long
as
the
court
can
find
a
reason
or
that
there
was
justification
by
the
legislature
or
the
state
body
to
rationalize
or
to
justify
the
use
of
this
particular
exercise
for
some
effect
other
than
religion
that
it
then
does
not
conflict
with
the
establishment
clause.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
very
statement
was
made
in
mcgowan
where
the
--
mr.
justice
black
at
page
425
stated,
a
statutory
discrimination
will
not
be
set
aside
if
any
state
affects
reasonably
may
be
conceded
--
concede
to
justify
it.
now,
i
know
that
was
in
relationship
to
the
equal
protection
clause,
but
it
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
say
that
they
do
stem
from
a
violation
of
the
ten
commandments,
but
the
mere
fact
that
they're
made
crimes
by
law
doesn't
mean
that
they're
in
violation
of
the
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
first
amendment.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree
that
there
was
a
departure
in
mcgowan
and
i
say
that
the
legislature
and
the
state
body
is
entitled
to
the
presumption
of
constitutionality
where
it
can
be
shown
that
the
particular
exercise,
the
particular
service,
or
whatever
you
might
wish
to
call
it,
has
a
basis
other
than
in
religion
itself.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
only
departure
that
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
we
could
point
to
specifically
in
the
same
light
as
mcgowan
is
on
the
excuse
provision
in
which
the
rule
was
amended
to
provide
that
the
child
who
did
not
wish
to
attend
could
be
excused.
i
don't
say
that
this
is
the
same
type
of
departure
as
existed
in
mcgowan.
i
would
like
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes,
sir?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
there's
a
--
mr.
justice
black,
may
i
say
that
i
think
this
was
basically
answered
in
your
opinion
in
mcgowan
when
you
said
the
mere
fact
that
it
may
--
a
particular
practice
may
or
may
not
coincide
with
the
views
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
of
some
or
all
religions.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
doesn't
make
it
unconstitutional.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
am
not
drawing
on
mcgowan
as
being
the
absolute
authority.
i
am
drawing
on
mcgowan
to
sh
--
to
try
to
persuade
the
court
that
basically,
if
we
are
in
a
position
to
show
that
this
will
perform
a
function
other
than
pure
religiousness
itself
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
am
not
disavowing
anything
in
that
respect.
what
i
am
saying
is
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
believe
that
the
school
authorities
feel
that,
although
it
has
its
basis
in
religion,
although
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
religious
prayer,
as
far
as
the
lord's
prayer
is
concerned
or
the
passages
of
the
bible,
it
is
calling
upon
these
ancient
documents
which
set
forth
many
moral
lessons
and
ethical
values
and
that
these
helped
inculcate
the
spirit
of
morality
and
the
ethics
within
the
child
himself.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
us
decided
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it
would
be
pure
speculation
on
my
part
to
say
whether
they
would
or
whether
they
wouldn't.
i
can
concede
where
they
would.
i
would
say
that
in
the
society
in
which
baltimore
exists,
that
the
likelihood
is
in
the
discretion
of
the
school
board
in
selecting
a
work
which
it
thinks
would
be
most
in
tuned
with
the
spirit
of
the
people
of
the
state
of
maryland
or
the
city
of
baltimore.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
pardon
me?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
think
it
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
think
it's
a
combination
of
both.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
justice
black,
if
i
may,
sir,
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
do
not
think
it
partakes
of
a
religious
ceremony.
i
think
it
has
religion
in
it.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
think
it
does
not
partake
of
religious
instruction.
i
think
it
does
not
partake
of
religion
as
such.
i
think
it
has
these
other
values.
i
think
that
it
is
intended
for
the
children
to
know
the
lord's
prayer
and
to
know
certain
things
pertaining
to
passages
from
the
bible.
i
think
it's
intended
for
a
spirit
to
start
off
the
school
day
and
i
think
that's
the
only
basic
purpose.
it
coincides
with
religion.
this,
i
cannot
deny.
the
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
take
the
position
that
if
it
serve
a
secular
purpose
within
itself,
the
mere
fact
that
it
may
be
sou
--
it
may
be
framed
in
religion
does
not
constitute
an
abridgment
of
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
it's
a
full
religious
ceremony
for
religion
itself?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
it's
conceivable
that
it
could
have.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
again,
i
say
that
i
think
it
goes
again
to
a
matter
of
degree.
as
this
court
has
said,
what
the
wall
separates
is
a
matter
of
degree.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
think
that
--
if
there's
any
comment
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
if
there's
any
comment
that
has
the
--
partakes
of
the
nature
of
instruction
or
discussion
in
these
opening
exercises,
that
it
might
well
be
an
abridgment
of
the
first
amendment,
the
establishment
clause.
this
is
one
of
the
factors
that
we
have
here.
it
is
not
--
there
is
no
comment
with
respect
to
these
prayers.
this
is
different
from
engel.
in
the
engel
case,
the
very,
and
if
i
may
take
a
moment
to
mention
to
the
court,
as
i
know
the
court
is
aware
of
the
record
in
the
engel
case,
that
on
the
regent
statement
on
moral
and
spiritual
training
in
the
schools,
which
was
recommended
by
the
chief
administrative
officer
of
the
new
york
state
board
of
education,
they
said
this.
“in
our
opinion,
the
securing
of
the
peace
and
the
safety
of
our
country
and
our
state
against
such
dangers
points
to
the
essentiality
of
teaching
our
children
as
set
forth
in
the
declaration
of
independence
that
almighty
god
is
their
creator.
we
believe
that
the
oath
of
allegiance
be
joined
with
this
act
of
reverence
to
god.”
and
then
they
follow
with
the
regent's
prayer.
we
believe
that
thus
constantly
confronted
with
the
basic
truth
of
their
existence.
the
children
will
be
properly
prepared
to
follow
the
faith
of
their
fathers.
we
believe
that
thus
the
school
will
fulfill
its
high
function
of
supplementing
the
training
of
the
home,
ever
intensifying
in
the
child
the
love
of
god
for
parent
and
for
home
which
is
the
mark
of
true
character
in
training.
we
believe
that
this
statement
will
be
subscribed
to
by
men
--
all
men
of
goodwill.
this
was
clearly
intended
for
the
purpose
of
teaching
religion
within
the
opening
exercises
in
the
schools.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
is
the
statement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
say
that
the
only
place
that
the
letter
of
our
superintendent
approaches
is,
in
that
it
says
it
recognizes
the
existence
of
god
but
it
goes
on
and
establishes
the
salutary
effects
that
this
has
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
the
school
day.
this
is
what
the
important
part
is
in
our
opinion.
how
it
helps
the
school
to
get
on
with
the
work
of
that
day.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
not,
and
i
might
say
that,
again,
this
is
because
we
are
at
the
disadvantage
of
being
without
a
record
in
the
case.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
in
other
words,
we
didn't
have
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
was
his
conclusion.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
respectfully
suggest
that
it
was
a
dissenting
conclusion.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
was
an
assumption
that
he
made
and
that
there
may
have
been
some
basis
for
his
assumption.
we
take
the
position
that
it
does
have
and
if
it
can
be
determined
or
if
it
can
be
found
that
it
does
have
the
salutary
effect,
then
we
say
this
rest
within
the
prerogative
of
the
school
board
to
allow
this
particular
type
of
morning
exercise
to
be
conducted.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
justice
harlan
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
might
say
this,
sir,
that
to
get
into
the
question
of
the
degree
of
the
separation
of
church
and
state,
we
can
make
without
any
problem
whatsoever
a
very
significant
distinction
between
the
exercises
in
the
baltimore
city
schools
and
those
which
were
conducted
in
new
york
under
the
--
with
the
regents'
prayer.
that
clearly
was
a
prayer
which
was
composed
by
the
authorities
in
question.
this
was,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
engel,
the
book
of
common
prayer
changed
from
king
to
king
and
queen
to
king.
this
was
one
of
the
dangers
of
letting
the
state
get
into
the
business
of
actually
composing
a
prayer.
this
is
what
i
conceive
to
be
one
of
the
basic
reasons
why
this
court
struck
down
the
22-word
prayer
in
engel.
in
our
case,
we
don't
have
a
state
putting
its
hands
into
the
composition
of
a
prayer.
this
is
a
prayer,
the
lord's
prayer,
traditional,
2000
years
old,
the
bible
going
back
even
beyond,
although
the
versions
have
changed
to
somewhat
between
the
holy
scriptures
and
the
king
james
version
and
in
the
douay
version.
in
substance,
they
are
basically
the
same,
although
there's
some
differences
in
terminology.
we're
talking
about
a
traditional
exercise.
we're
talking
about
a
traditional
prayer
and
i
would
say
this.
i
would
not
ask
this
court
to
uphold
the
right
of
a
state
to
enter
into
the
field
of
composing
prayers
because
i
say
that
if
it
did
so,
it
would
be
opening
the
door
to
the
slanting
of
the
prayer
to
suit
the
particular
area
or
the
particular
teacher
or
the
particular
jurisdiction
in
which
it
is
composed.
this,
i
have
no
problem
with.
i
think
engel
has
no
authority
for
the
position
that
we
find
ourselves
in
this
case.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
say
that
i
believe
that
the
most
that
can
be
said
about
engel
is
that,
as
long
as
it
doesn't
get
involved
in
the
composition
of
an
official
prayer
or
the
sanctioning
of
an
official
prayer
which
we
believe
the
court
truly
meant
a
new
prayer,
a
modern
prayer,
some
prayer
that
did
not
have
its
origins
in
history.
some
prayer
that
did
not
have
its
origins
which
had
been
read
as
the
most
widely
read
prayer.
it
has
beauty
which
the
--
although
all
of
them
may
have
some
of
the
beauty
that
the
lord's
prayer
has,
none
of
them
can
get
together
and
put
all
of
that
beauty
into
one
prayer.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
these
are
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mccollum,
i
find
difficulty
with
because
this
was
a
case
where
religious
instruction
was
actually
conducted
on
the
school
premises
by
religious
teachers.
and,
the
mccollum
case
was
simply
a
case
where
the
court
says,
“we
will
not
permit
the
taxpayer's
money
to
be
used
to
permit
religious
instruction
by
religious
people
on
the
school
premises.”
but
they
said
if
you
go
up,
as
it
did
in
zorach,
if
you
remove
yourself
from
the
premises
and
they
permit
--
on
the
release
time,
to
go
away
where
the
state's
pocketbook
is
not
involved,
then
we
see
no
violation.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understood
your
question,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
i
said
it
is
--
i
say
it
is
not
instruction.
we
don't
say
that
this
is
religious
instruction.
we
say
that
this
is
the
opportunity
for
the
children
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
day
to
partake
a
bit
of
the
history
of
the
bible,
to
partake
a
bit
of
raising
their
minds
as
they
do
in
the
lord's
prayer,
to
god.
i
cannot
deny
this
but
that
there
--
that
it
serves
a
purpose
of
inculcating
these
moral
and
ethical
precepts
and
values
within
the
children
themselves
and
it
gives
them
a
tone
for
the
beginning
of
the
day.
in
the
--
we're
talking
about
the
mccollum,
a
45-minute
release
time
program
to
go
into
the
classroom
with
religious
teachers
to
study
religion,
the
religion
of
the
choice
of
the
particular
student,
using
the
taxpayer's
money
for
that
purpose.
this,
i
think,
was
the
defect
in
mccollum.
torcaso,
i
have
no
problem
with
because
torcaso
was
simply
a
case
where
the
oath
was
held
--
the
oath
itself
was
not
held
to
be
bad.
it
merely
said
that
you
cannot
compel
the
oath
to
be
taken
by
this
particular
man
who
has
the
right
to
this
particular
office
except
for
that
oath.
the
same
thing
is
true
of
barnette.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
may
i
say,
with
all
due
respect,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
have
never
heard
that
statement
made
and
at
least
it
hasn't
been
made
to
me.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
but,
i
would
say
this
that
i
think
that
there
can
be
danger
in
discussion.
and
i
was
--
i
recall
mr.
justice
stewart's
question
to
mr.
kerpelman
about
compulsory
--
a
compulsory
course
in
religion
compelling
all
the
children
to
take
a
course
in
religion
and
mr.
kerpelman
said
he
saw
no
constitutional
abridgment
there.
and
yet
in
my
own
personal
opinion,
if
i
may
express
a
personal
opinion,
i
think
the
danger
in
that
area
would
be
so
far
greater
than
the
mere
recitation
of
the
lord's
prayer
and
reading
of
passages
of
the
bible
without
comment
because
there
is
the
opportunity
for
the
particular
teacher
with
the
particular
views
to
get
in
and
really
drive
home
this
religious
philosophy
that
he
or
she
may
entertain.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
this
is
the
problem
that
we
see
ourselves
in.
where
does
it
lead?
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no,
excuse
me.
i
didn't
know.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
the
free
exercise.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
mr.
justice
stewart,
i
was
just
going
to
say
that
mr.
baker
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
had
intended
to
address
his
remarks
to
that
particular
question
and
i
see
i've
really
gone
beyond
the
time
that
had
been
allotted
and
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
mr.
baker
will
pick
up
the
discussion
concerning
free
exercise.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
think
this
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
--
case
is
certainly
a
question
of
reexamination
and
how
far
did
--
we
want
to
go.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
yes
--
mr.
justice
harlan,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
that's
the
problem.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
do
not
quarrel.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
do,
sir.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
no.
no
i
--
no,
i
didn't
mean
--
not
reexamine
vitale.
i
meant
reexamine
the
implications
of
vitale,
the
questions
which
were
left
unanswered.
in
the
very
beginning
of
vitale
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
only
in
the
light
of
how
far
are
we
ultimately
going
to
go
and
where
does
it
put
us
today.
i
don't
--
i
cannot
disagree
with
vitale.
mr.
francis
b.
burch
well,
i
--
mr.
francis
b.
burch
i
might
say,
as
--
well,
i
didn't
understand
mr.
justice
harlan's
question
to
be
exactly
that.
i
thought
he
said,
“are
we,
in
effect,
not
confronted
in
this
case
with
the
question
of
reexamining
the
whole
area
and
deciding
exactly
where
we
are
and
where
we
have
to
go.
this
is
what
i've
understood
the
question
and
i
apologize
if
i
answered
the
question
without
completely
understanding.
thank
you.
