mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
this
lord's
prayer
and
bible
reading
case,
which
is
before
the
court
today,
has
perhaps
a
unique
importance
for
all
of
us.
the
reason
is
that
all
of
us
have
certainly
at
some
time,
been
concerned
with
philosophical
meanings
attached
to
our
existence
here,
see
the
significance
of
that
existence.
and,
all
of
us
have
no
doubt,
directed
ourselves
to
resolution
of
questions
of
the
goals
and
means
and
functions
of
mankind
and
all
of
us
have
thought
and
contemplated
and
no
doubt
prayed.
such
contemplation
and
thought,
it
is
in
the
very
nature
of
man
to
perform,
sapient
man,
wondering,
inquiring
man.
and
the
nature
of
man
being
what
it
is,
man
has
developed
over
the
long
centuries
complex
and
subtle
systems
of
philosophy
and
out
of
these
systems,
and
out
of
the
historical
knowledge
and
out
of
faith,
man
has
constructed
complex
and
subtle
systems
of
religious
belief.
and
out
of
these
systems
of
religious
belief,
man
has
constructed
doctrine.
at
the
same
time,
extending
back
through
painful
ages,
man
has
concurrently
developed
differing
and
no
less
subtle
and
no
less
complex
systems
of
government
based
at
different
times
and
different
places
on
different
principles.
perhaps,
the
noblest
of
all
of
these
systems
of
government
is
that
system
embodied
in
the
enlightened
and
libertarian
constitution,
including
the
bill
of
rights
of
the
united
states
of
america.
in
fact,
the
principles
embodied
in
this
document
are
probably
so
noble
and
so
ennobling
that
without
doubt,
many
of
us
experience
some
difficulty
in
daily,
and
drawing
ourselves
up
to
the
perpetual
measure
of
their
standards.
one
of
these
standards,
of
course,
set
forth
in
the
constitution
and
the
bill
of
rights
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
is
the
principle
that
the
church
and
the
state
in
this
country
shall
remain
separate
and
apart
and
that
in
fact,
there
shall
be
a
wall
of
separation
between
them
which
shall
be
maintained
high
and
impregnable.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
that
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof,
mr.
justice.
at
any
rate,
it
seems
that
my
conclusion,
i
respectfully
say,
mr.
justice,
is
that
the
first
amendment
has
been
interpreted
to
mean
that
government
shall
not
sponsor
or
favor
any
one
religion
or
religion
in
general
and
shall
--
and
that
religion
shall
not
interpose
itself
in
matters
of
government.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
amendment
as
applied
to
the
states
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
cantwell
versus
connecticut
and
that
line
of
cases.
this
particular
case
concerns
a
rule
of
the
board
of
school
commissioners
of
baltimore
city
which
is
found
at
page
4
of
the
petitioner's
brief
and
it's
very
short,
i'll
perhaps
read
it
to
the
court.
“opening
exercises,”
this
is
a
rule
drawn
under
the
administrative
powers
of
the
local
school
board,
and
this
rule
has
been
in
existence,
i
believe,
since
about
1905.
“opening
exercises,
each
school,
either
collectively
or
in
classes,
shall
be
opened
by
the
reading
with
that
comment
of
a
chapter
in
the
holy
bible
and/or
the
use
of
the
lord's
prayer.
the
douay
version
may
be
used
by
those
pupils
who
prefer
it.”
this
rule,
before
the
advent
of
this
case
was
amended
as
follows.
“any
child
shall
be
excused
from
participating
in
the
opening
exercises
or
from
attending
the
opening
exercises
upon
the
written
request
of
his
parent
or
guardian.”
if
your
honors
please,
i
feel
that
the
reason
for
the
first
amendment
interpretation
having
been
at
some
time
stated
to
have
erected
a
wall
between
church
and
state
is
clear.
it
stretches
back
as
far
back
as
the
history
of
governments,
and
particularly
as
far
back
as
the
history
of
religions
themselves.
the
cruel
and
arid
features
of
this
history
were
alluded
to
in
engel.
they
were
discussed
in
torcaso.
they
were
treated
at
great
scholarly
length
in
the
sunday
law
cases.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
your
honor,
it
is
not.
the
--
there
was
no
testimony
taken
in
the
case
and,
therefore,
the
version
which
was
used
could
not
have
been
adduced.
this
case
was
before
the
court
on
demurrer
and
the
allegations
in
the
petition
did
not
allege
the
version
which
was
used.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
how
they
determine
that?
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
no,
your
honor,
there
is
none.
the
record
would
not
have
that
because
the
case
was
on
demurrer.
no
evidence
was
taken.
i
--
the
rule
itself
seems
to
be
an
invitation
to
a
short
religious
war
every
day.
i
don't
know
exactly
how
it's
arranged.
i
suppose
according
to
the
feeling
of
the
majority,
the
pupils
or,
perhaps,
the
feeling
of
the
teacher
in
the
particular
instance.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
your
honor,
i
can
see
no
constitutional
objection
to
the
study
of
religion,
to
the
study
of
history,
to
the
study
of
biblical
history,
for
example,
to
the
study
of
the
bible
as
a
book
of
literature.
what
we
have
here,
of
course,
is
a
religious
ceremony
set
up
by
the
school,
conducted
by
the
school
and,
by
very
strong
implication,
having
the
support
and
the
favor
of
the
school.
and,
the
ceremony
is
sectarian
as
any
ceremony
must
be.
it
has
apparently
become
impossible
in
modern
age
with
the
numerous
sects
and
the
numerous
religions
to
have
a
ceremony
which
is
not
sectarian.
they
were
not
able
to
accomplish
it,
i
would
say
in
my
own
mind,
even
in
the
regent's
prayer
in
new
york
and
where
we
have
a
ceremony
set
up
that
is
a
different
thing
from
a
study.
we
expressly
disclaim
any
objection
to
any
study
of
any
sort,
including
comparative
religions
or
whatever
they
might
be
called
in
junior
high
school
or
high
school
phraseology,
any
subject.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
no,
your
honor.
as
i
read
engel,
the
phrase
“composed
or
sanctioned”
would
seem
to
include
--
sanctioning
would
seem
to
me
to
indicate
choosing
or
favoring
or
allowing
or
permitting
any
particular
prayer.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
interpret
engel
as
having
eliminated
only
composed
prayers
overlooks
the
language
in
engel
concerning
sanctioned
prayers.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
i
--
well,
this
is
implied
from
the
rule
itself,
your
honor,
and
from
the
selection
of
the
exercise,
as
i
recall.
i
don't
believe
our
petition
called
it
that.
however,
the
respondents'
brief
did
call
it
a
devotional
exercise
at
one
point.
i'm
fairly
certain,
i
believe
so.
the
conclusion
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
courts
have
come
to
in
this
country,
is
that,
to
quote
mr.
justice
rutledge
in
everson
as
he
was
reiterated
in
engel,
“the
price
of
religious
freedom
is
doubled.
it
is
that
the
church
and
religion
shall
live
both
within
that
freedom
and
upon
that
freedom.”
yet,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
doctrine
has
become
established,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
church
and
the
state
should
be
separated.
there
has
grown
up
this
practice
in
the
maryland
schools
and
it's
been
tolerated
and
blinked
at
for
so
long
that
the
respondents
have
now
denominated
a
tradition.
well,
i
don't
think,
if
your
honors
please,
that
we
can
repeal
the
constitution
by
this
particular
means.
a
matter
which
is
once
unconstitutional
does
not
become
constitutional
by
being
allowed
to
persist,
even
though
it
has
continued
almost
as
long
as
plessy
versus
ferguson
can
continue
--
had
continued.
and,
this
particular
practice
has
continued
without
even
a
plessy
versus
ferguson
to
support
it.
our
society
develops.
it
matures.
its
institutions
develop.
they
change.
the
practice
which
one
generation
had
not
the
courage
to
question,
much
less
overturn,
seems
to
me
must,
if
we
are
to
advance,
be
questioned
by
the
next
generation.
and
that
generation
must
even
summons
up
the
courage
to
overturn
certain
practices
within
the
constitutional
framework
when
the
issue
is
put
to
them.
of
course,
we
are
asked
how
can
a
religious
men
have
such
an
attitude,
and
we
are
told
that
the
answer
to
this
is
that
those
who
urge
the
petition
of
the
petitioner
--
the
position
of
the
petitioners
here
not
only
are
not
religious
but
they
have
set
themselves
in
opposition
to
religion.
and
i
respectfully
say,
if
your
honors
please,
that
this
is
completely
untrue.
it
is
unreasonable
to
say
this
as
it
is
unreasonable
to
say
that
a
person
who
is
opposed
to
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
is
opposed
to
law
enforcement,
or
that
a
person
who
is
opposed
to
censorship
is
opposed
to
purity.
arguments
such
as
this,
i
feel,
lift
a
continent
of
all
the
stone.
they
are
non-sect
declarations.
the
respondents,
it
seems
to
me,
perhaps
have
the
mark
of
being
something
like
non-religious
for
they
have
said
in
their
brief
at
page
28
that
this
ceremony
has
come
to
have
a
meaning
which
transcends
mere
religiousness,
and
i
don't
want
to
--
i
don't
wish
to
cast
reflections
on
a
particular
language
that
they
chose
but
it
seems
to
me
that
infinity
plus
one
is
still
infinity
and
i
don't
know
that
there
is
anything
which
can
transcend
religiousness.
the
petitioners
certainly
do
not
urge
that
there
is
any
such
thing.
the
petitioners
are
merely
here
asking
that
an
injury
which
they
have
suffered
and
which
they
say
is
guaranteed
under
the
constitution
be
redressed.
the
injury
is
very
real.
now
upon
the
pleadings
in
this
case
which
are
before
the
court
on
demurrer,
there
can
be
no
argument
but
that
the
petitioners
have
suffered
a
substantial
personal
detriment.
they
claim
and
the
respondents
by
their
demurrer,
have
admitted
that
william
murray,
the
infant
plaintiff,
have
suffered
substantially
from
the
conduct
of
these
exercises,
specifically
the
allegation
state
that
he
has
lost
cast,
that
he
has
been
regarded
with
aversion
by
his
fellows,
that
he
has
been
subjected
to
reproach
and
insult
and
that
doubt
has
been
raised
as
to
his
morality
and
good
citizenship.
and,
though
all
these
injuries
may
be
in
the
psychological
or
the
intangible
sphere,
yet,
they
are
certainly
as
substantial
an
injury
as
one
could
perhaps
allege.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
may
be
easily
assumed
that
a
majority
of
parents
would
have
--
would
like
to
have
their
children
say
this
prayer
in
the
school.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
--
well,
for
example,
the
police
power
can
yield
to
the
necessity
that
the
public
be
protected
from
violence.
that
is
--
freedom
of
speech
would
yield
to
the
police
power.
freedom
of
assembly
would
yield
to
the
right
of
the
public
to
have
its
property
protected
against
riots.
but,
this
is
a
new
concept
to
me
that
a
person's
freedom
of
--
that
a
person's
free
exercise
of
religion
or
his
right
to
be
unburdened
or
free
of
an
establishment
of
religion
must
yield
to
the
free
exercise
of
religion
of
other
parties
when
this
other
parties
are
in
the
public
school,
they're
saying
to
the
petitioner,
“give
us
your
support,
give
us
your
taxes,
give
us
your
faith
and
confidence
and
trust
in
the
school,”
which
incidentally
the
petitioners
do
give
wholeheartedly,
and
they
say
that
the
taxing
part
of
what
they
give
is
but
a
mere
incidental
to
the
other
things
that
they
give
which
is
a
belief
in
the
importance
in
our
society
of
secular
public
schools.
they
give
all
these.
the
majority
says
that,
“in
return
for
this,
we
wish
to
run
a
religious
exercise
which
caused
you
--
causes
you
these
substantial
detriments.”
i
don't
think
that
the
free
exercise
of
the
majority
--
the
right
to
the
free
exercise
can
work
that
way
because,
in
exercising
its
right,
it
is
establishing
a
religion
in
the
public
school.
by
establishing
the
religion
in
a
public
school,
they
take
away
of
course
the
right
to
the
petitioners
to
be
free
of
an
establishment.i
don't
believe
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
your
honor,
now
that
i
believe
is
more
an
illusory
out
than
a
real
one.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
right.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
and
then,
because
of
a
matter
which
is
not
in
a
secular
sphere,
which
you
can't
discuss
in
class
in
a
rational
matter
because
--
manner
because
religion
cannot
be
in
a
last
analysis
rationale
but,
because
of
a
matter
which
is
in
the
spiritual
sphere,
this
child
who
chooses
to
walk
away,
and
i
think
it
can
be
admitted,
he
would
have
no
answer
to
the
people
who
would
think
that
this
was
a
peculiar
or
an
ungentlemanly
or
perhaps
a
bad
thing
to
do.
he
would
have
no
answer
because
his
answers
are
all
within
the
heart
of
the
people
that
make
these
allegations.
he
has
no
answer.
this
is
not
a
secular
matter.
when
he
walks
away,
he
then
becomes
subject
to
whatever
sanctions
school
boys
may
impose.
and,
i
might
say,
to
whatever
sanction
school
teachers
may
impose
and
i
might
say
this,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
no
evidence
sir.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
but,
where
we
put
the
proof,
we
would
prove
that
these
acts
of
coercion
were
very
substantial,
that
this
boy
was
spat
upon,
insulted,
assaulted.
the
criminal
docket
of
the
northeastern
police
station
in
baltimore
city
will
show
that
certain
persons
were
found
guilty
of
assaulting
him
when
this
case
gained
notoriety
and
he's
an
infant.
this
boy
is
now
in
his
junior
year.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor,
but
if
it's
on
a
rational
matter,
“did
you
steal
johnny's
marbles?”
or
“did
you
win
the
game
or
did
he
win
the
game?”
it's
something
which
the
constitution
i
don't
think
has
set
out
any
standards.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
but,
under
the
establishment
clause
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
your
honor,
i
can't
quite
follow
that,
and
i
say
that
respectfully,
because,
under
the
establishment
clause,
they
have
no
right
to
establish
a
religion.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor,
they
have.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
thank
you,
mr.
justice.
as
i
was
thinking
in
terms
of
a
silent
prayer
but,
certainly,
mr.
justice
black,
if
someone
came
in
here
and
interrupted
the
proceedings
of
this
court
that
would
certainly
not
be
within
their
constitutional
rights.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
no,
except,
analogously,
i
feel
that
a
person
comes
in
and
makes
a
speech
which
constitutes
disorderly
conduct.
although
he
has
a
right
to
free
speech,
he
has
a
responsibility
to
conduct
himself
in
an
orderly
manner.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
your
honor,
i
feel
that,
under
your
honor's
hypothesis,
it
--
in
a
way
is.
here,
the
majority
in
a
class
wishes
to
establish
a
religion.
question,
can
they
res
--
establish
a
religion
or
does
that
reach
one
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
minority?
after
all,
the
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
your
honor
is
clearly
more
the
legal
scholar
than
i
am.
yet,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
prohibition
--
prohibitions
contained
in
the
first
amendment
are
two
prohibitions.
they're
prohibition
against
interfering
with
someone's
free
exercise,
they're
prohibition
against
the
establishment,
and
these
prohibitions
operate
to
the
benefit
of
the
minority.
they
cannot
be
used
as
a
sword
by
the
majority.
and,
i
see
your
honor
disagrees
with
it.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
but
that
is
our
conception
of
the
case.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
correct.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
the
majority
has
its
legislature
and
the
majority
has
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
however,
it
is
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
clearly.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me,
also,
that
the
compact
of
the
constitution
says
that
if
the
minority
has
a
right,
we
don't
have
noses
and
then
if
there
are
more
persons
opposed
to
their
having
that
right
than
not
having
it,
that
we
take
the
right
away
from
them.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
must
be
a
guiding
constitutional
condition.
otherwise,
we
have
no
amendments
to
the
constitution
left.
the
--
as
i
have
said,
the
petitioners
are
in
the
position
where
they
wish
to
give
their
support
to
the
schools.
they
want
in
return,
that
the
school
should
treat
its
secular
matters
only
as
they
feel
that
the
school
is
called
upon
to
do.
they
don't
want
--
wish
to
have
any
dogmas
in
spiritual
matters
thrust
upon
the
children
who
attend
the
schools
and
no
matter
how
retiring
or
mild
or
neutrally
worded
any
of
these
things
may
be,
under
the
condition
of
religions
in
our
pluralistic
american
society,
these
prayers
are
always
secular
--
sectarian,
i'm
sorry,
as
was
the
prayer
in
engel.
this,
of
course,
is
the
lord's
prayer.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
stronger
situation
than
engel.
the
lord's
prayer
is
taken
directly
from
the
new
testament
and
it's
not
a
matter
which
the
religiousness
of
can
be
very
much
disputed.
there's
no
question
that
it's
a
sectarian
religious
ceremony,
it
seems
to
me.
the
authorities
that
i
have
been
able
to
find
in
the
theological
field
seem
to
be
agreed
that
the
lord's
prayer
is
a
christian
prayer
and
even
within
the
christian
denominations,
there
is
difference
as
to
which
version
shall
be
used.
the
douay
omits
the
“thine
is
the
kingdom
and
the
power
and
the
glory
forever
and
ever,
amen”,
as
i
understand.
the
matter
is
something
which
we
run
into
head-on
every
time
that
we
try
to
have
a
religious
ceremony
conducted
by
a
government
or
by
a
government
agency.
we
give
sanction
or
favor,
as
was
prohibited
in
barnett,
as
was
prohibited
in
many
other
cases,
in
torcaso,
in
mcgowan.
and
give
sanction
or
favor
to
one
religion
as
opposed
to
other
religions
or
we
give
sanction
or
favor
to
religion
as
opposed
to
non-religion.
this
case,
of
course,
makes
everyone
uncomfortable
because
a
large
majority
of
the
country
loves
this
prayer.
it's
a
beautiful
prayer.
certainly,
the
large
majority
of
the
country
loves
the
literature
of
the
bible
and
it's
certainly
one
of
man's
outstanding
works
and
therefore,
it
gives
us
i
think
a
great
deal
of
discomfort
to
have
to
face
the
fact
that
perhaps,
this
ceremony
which
most
people
adore
is
an
unconstitutional
ceremony
because
it's
a
religious
ceremony
and
it
is
not
a
secular
study.
there
is
no
reason,
and
i've
seen
it
lamented
many
times,
it
has
been
lamented
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent
in
the
schempp
case
which
follows
that
--
in
a
footnote,
i
think
it
was
footnote
9,
referred
to
in
footnote
--
to
the
respondents'
brief
--
to
the
attorney
generals'
amicus
brief,
that
study
of
the
bible,
study
of
religion
and
religiousness
is
out
of
the
schools,
that
things
are
too
neutral.
baltimore
sage
who
is
well-known,
general
w.
johnson,
i
recall,
writing
a
letter
to
the
newspaper
about
a
year
ago
lamenting
the
same
fact
when
this
issue
first
came
to
the
court
that
the
trouble
with
biblical
study
in
the
school
is
that
there
are
too
many
sects
who
are
contesting
and
as
a
result,
he
lamented
the
fact
that
every
time
study
of
the
bible
as
literature
or
as
history
or
as
historic
or
as
cultural
history
is
tried
in
the
schools,
that
these
various
sects
object
to
it.
that
is
not
the
fault
of
the
petitioners.
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps,
the
resolution
of
this
matter,
if
this
practice
is
unconstitutional,
is
for
the
sects
to
not
be
so
selfish,
self-centered
on
their
own
dogmas
that
they
would
raise
these
objections
to
the
study
of
the
bible
in
school,
for
the
use
of
the
bible
in
english
class,
to
the
study
of
religions.
we
have
no
objections.
there
can
be
no
constitutional
objection
when
it
is
carried
on
as
a
secular
study.
i
would
like
to
get
to
a
point
which
the
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
no.
its
--
it
relies
on
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause
and
your
honor
is
about
to
ask,
i
assume,
how
can
an
atheist
freely
exercise
his
religion.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
jumping
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
i
guess
i'm
getting
a
little
gun
shy
with
this
case.
people
have
been
attacking
me
for
a
long
time.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes
sir.
the
petitioners
have
put
forth
an
argument,
which
i
would
like
to
treat
of
and
that
is
that
they
have
said
that
this
ceremony
should
be
allowable
because
it
is
not
a
very
religious
ceremony
and
they
have
said
that
it
actually
transcends
religion.
they
used
the
language
saying
that
the
religiousness
of
a
ceremony
is
a
matter
of
degree
and
i
suppose
the
implication
is
that
nobody
would
argue,
for
example,
that
to
conduct
the
protestant
communion
service
in
the
school
would
be
unconstitutional.
nobody
would
argue
that
to
conduct
a
catholic
mass
in
the
school
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
they
have
put
forth
the
argument
that
this
ceremony
is
only
somewhat
religious
and
that
it
has
only
a
shade
of
religiousness.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
argument
your
honors
must
feel,
the
constitution
recognizes
no
somewhat
abuse
of
due
process,
no
somewhat
illegal
search,
recognizes
no
somewhat
restrictive
restriction
on
free
speech
or
the
press,
either
a
matter
is
a
restriction
of
a
constitutional
guarantee
or
it
is
not.
now,
what
surprised
me
as
i
read
further
in
the
respondents'
brief
was
that,
after
arguing
that
this
matter
of
religiousness
can
take
on
any
shade
in
a
spectrum
and
be
slightly
religious
or
extremely
religious,
they
then
go
on
to
argue
that
the
dissenter
is
right
to
be
free
from
coercion
does
not
exist.
that
he
has
an
absolute
right
to
endure
the
coercion.
they
said
on
pages
32
and
33
of
their
brief,
“the
dissenter
cannot
ask
that
the
source
of
disapproval
or
the
alleged
factors
of
compulsion
be
eliminated
so
that
he
will
be
spared
the
burden
of
any
disapproval.
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
sensibilities
and
feelings
of
children
are
involved.”
still
quoting,
your
honors,
“this
is,
by
choice,
the
dissenter's
problem.
adult
or
child,
the
conviction
of
the
dissenter
must
of
necessity
be
sufficiently
strong
to
permit
him
to
effectuate
his
dissent
and
to
bare
the
disapproval
of
others.”
and,
i
say,
your
honors,
that
i
am
shocked
by
this
argument.
here,
they
have
admitted
that
william
murray,
junior
high
school
boy
when
this
case
was
filed,
still
an
infant
at
the
age
of
about
15,
a
junior
in
high
school
has
been
regarded
with
aversion.
he
has
been
subjected
to
insult.
his
morality
has
been
brought
into
question.
his
good
citizenship
has
been
brought
into
question
and
although
the
respondents
argue
that
the
religiousness
of
the
ceremony
is
a
matter
of
degree,
that
the
necessity
for
the
infant
to
endure
this
compulsion
is
an
absolute.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
your
honor,
it
does
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
--
seem
to
me
that
that
would
impinge
on
the
constitutional
prohibition
against
an
establishment.
there
are
some
question
as
to
whether
this
is
a
recognition
of
religion
or
all
religions
but,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
quite
possible
that
that
would
be
a
constitutional
procedure,
providing
it's
not
something
imposed
from
above
by
the
school
authorities
entirely
but
something
which
perhaps
wells
up
from
within
the
classrooms.
i
don't
know.
of
course,
unfortunately,
i
feel
that
i
cannot
completely
answer
the
question
that
is
not
in
this
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
such
practice
would
probably
be
a
constitutional.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
thoughts
come
to
men
unbidden.
prayers
come
to
men
unbidden.
a
man
sends
them
onto
his
maker
frequently
as
a
prayer
when
they
come
to
him.
no
one
certainly
can
--
prayer
itself
cannot
be
unconstitutional.
what
we
ask
in
this
case
is
that
the
school
can
find
itself
to
secular
functions
that
it
leave
matters
of
spiritual
training,
spiritual
faith,
matters
of
religion
to
the
home,
to
the
schools,
to
the
religious
institutions
which
have
always,
by
american
tradition,
had
great
honor
in
this
country
and
which
always,
by
the
american
tradition,
all
of
us
have
had
respect
for
the
power
of
it.
and,
that
is
not
what
we
object.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
i'm
afraid
not.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor
is
referring
to
the
fact
that
these
schools
originally
were
set
up
as
adjuncts
of
--
usually
of
church
institutions.
when
they
were
cut
loose
from
the
church
institutions,
they
still
had
a
great
deal
of
sectarianism
connected
with
them.
that
was
better
than
new
schools,
i
would
say,
your
honor,
but
certainly
not
better,
in
present
day
society,
the
schools
without
a
sectarian
or
a
religious
sector
orientation.
no,
i
say
it's
not
better
than
a
school
without
sectarian
orientation.
i
would
rather
see
a
school
set
up
with
secular
orientation.
leave
the
sectarian
matters
of
faith
to
the
home
and
to
the
priesthood
and
the
rabbinate
and
the
protestant
clergy.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
yes
sir.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
no,
your
honor.
but
in
my
opinion,
i
think
that
the
preservation
of
secular
schools,
teaching
secular
subjects
only
is
very
important
to
our
society.
i
personally
feel
that
when
doctrinal
subjects
pervade
the
teaching
of
secular
subjects
that
it's
bad
for
the
doctrine
and
it's
bad
for
the
secular
subjects,
but
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
an
entirely
personal
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor,
absolutely.
there
certainly
is
no
constitutional
prohibition
against
parochial
schools.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
as
hypothesized
by
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
constitutional.
exactly
as
this
court
having
certain
autonomous
powers,
certain
rights
to
decide
what
its
procedure
will
be,
what
it
will
do
when
this
authority
does
not
extend
to
compelling
someone
who
attends
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
this
court
has
the
authority
to
say
a
prayer
in
the
morning,
to
have
the
fryer
say
“god
save
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
your
honor's
hypothesis
where
the
ceremony
comes
from
the
class
would
be
constitutional.
if
the
ceremony
is
imposed
by
the
school
authorities
which
thereby
give
it
their
sanction,
their
approval,
their
--
the
only
advantage
is
flowing
from
approval
by
the
authority,
then
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
think
that
that
would
be
the
distinction.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
it's
been
admitted
by
demurrer
that
the
allegations
are
true.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
and
if
the
case
were
remanded,
we'd
come
back
up
here
with
the
same
set
of
facts,
if
your
honor
please,
because
the
facts
are
as
alleged.
the
facts
are
very
much
as
alleged.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
i
would
ask
the
court
to
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
that
we've
assumed
that
those
people
would
say
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it's
quite
clear,
perhaps
even
clear
enough
for
the
court
to
take
judicial
notice,
that
most
people
would
like
to
have
this
prayer.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
they
would
like
to
have
this
prayer.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
this
is
one
of
the
most
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
their
religion,
yes,
your
honor,
as
long
as
they
are
the
majority.
if
they
were
the
minority,
they
would
not
feel
that
way,
i
think.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
they
have
no
right
to
do
so.
they
have
no
right
to
have
a
school
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
oh,
they
have
a
right
to
say
a
prayer
as
long
as
they're
not
interfering
with
the
orderly
conduct
in
the
school's
business.
they
have
no
right
to
have
the
school
authorities
to
make
everyone
say
this
prayer.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
providing
it
does
not
impinge
on
other
person's
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
providing
it
does
not
impinge
on
other
person's
constitutional
freedoms,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
of
course,
the
majority
is
there
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
of
course,
your
honor.
the
pupils
are
there
to
learn.
they're
there
to
study
secular
subjects.
if
they're
going
to
devote
the
whole
day
to
religious
ceremony,
they
apparently,
obviously,
had
no
right
to
do
that
just
by
a
majority
vote.
i
think,
likewise
that
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
i
intend
to
(inaudible)
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
i
intend
to
sit
at
the
meantime.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
mr.
chief
justice.
your
honors.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
your
honor,
a
question
which
is
perhaps
involved
is
a
question
of
standing.
now,
as
i
understand
it,
standing
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
i
was
going
to
say
this,
your
honor.
the
quaker
ceremony
would,
it
seems
to
me,
be
constitutional
because
it
could
--
i
don't
see
how
it
could
possibly
cause
anyone
any
detriment.
he
does
not
have
to
stand
up
and
profess
a
belief
or
disbelief
in
any
religion.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
he
could,
mr.
stewart
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
--
mr.
justice.
and,
i
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
i've
gone
to
the
question
of
standing,
perhaps
it's
unnecessary
but
let
me
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
if
it
were
labeled
the
quaker
ceremony,
it
would
be
clearly
unconstitutional,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
i
understood
the
question
pleaded.
we
had
this
quaker
type
of
ceremony,
not
denominated
as
any
such
thing.
mcgowan,
i
had
thought
indicated
that
if
an
establishment
of
religion
is
made
by
the
state
and
then
some
person
suffers
economic
detriment,
he
would
have
standing
to
come
into
court
and
complain.
i
thought
it
also
held
that
if
the
sabbath
observance
law
interfered
with
the
free
exercise
of
religion,
it
didn't
serve
a
circular
--
a
secular
purpose
primarily,
he
could
come
in
and
complain.
that
was
my
understanding
of
it.
i
understood
that
the
question
of
whether
it
was
the
establishment
clause
or
the
free
exercise
clause
goes
mainly
to
the
question
of
standing,
and
that
was
the
reason
that
i
was
contending,
your
honors
please,
that
both
clauses
apply
to
my
client.
the
establishment
has
been
made.
it
has
caused
him
detriment.
he
has
standing
to
complain.
also,
his
free
exercise
of
religion
has
been
interfered
with.
your
honors
had
opposed
the
question
of,
i
think,
of
mr.
justice
harlan,
whether
or
not
a
reevaluation
of
the
cases
on
this
particular
point
was
perhaps
called
for.
well,
if
your
honors
please,
as
a
practicing
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court
and
of
my
state
court,
i'm
very
proud
of
the
line
of
cases
as
they
now
stand.
i
think
that
what
is
more
needed
--
what
there
is
more
of
a
need
for
is
a
reevaluation
of
the
ethical
and
democratic
principles
which
these
cases
set
forth.
i
think
there's
more
of
a
need
for
charity
and
love
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
are
in
the
majority
and
who
have,
probably
unknowing
to
themselves,
been
offending
the
minority.
the
democratic
thing
for
them
to
do,
the
ethical
thing
to
do,
the
religious
thing
for
them
to
do
is
clearly
to
not
make
such
a
bone
of
contention
of
this
case.
after
all,
they're
overlooking
the
fact
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
so
i
am,
mr.
justice.
i'm
sorry.
but
the
case
of
course,
is
a
case
which
it
so
happens,
effects
everyone
by
a
small
modicum,
and
therefore,
there's
a
lot
of
interest
in
this
case,
and
therefore,
a
lot
of
people
who
are
not
professionally
learned
in
the
law,
had
misconstrued
the
precedence
to
this
case.
and
they
go
outside
the
constitution
in
their
discomfort
with
the
line
of
precedence
up
to
this
time.
i
feel
that
if
they
understood
what
this
case
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners
does
not
say
that
they
would
not
be
so
alarmed
and
upset.
i
would
like
to
speak
for
a
moment
on
the
question
of
the
demurrer
which
was
filed
in
this
case
and
whether
it
admits
the
allegations,
and
i
want
to
do
that
simply
by
referring
to
page
45
of
the
record
which
is
the
minority
opinion,
page
45,
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
and
that
was
a
4
to
3
decision.
the
minority
is
the
only
one
they
treated
of
this
question
as
to
whether
the
allegations
were
in
truth,
admitted
by
the
demurer
under
maryland
rules
of
pleading.
they
said,
as
to
the
first
of
these
questions,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
our
ordinary
rules
of
pleading
the
allegations
of
the
petition
are
not
so
insubstantial
as
to
be
brushed
aside
as
mere
conclusions
of
the
pleader
and
that
they
are
sufficient
on
demurrer.
in
that
same
paragraph,
incidentally
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
45,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
second
paragraph.
in
that
same
paragraph,
the
next
sentence
in
that
paragraph
states
that
--
something
to
the
effect
that
brown
versus
board
of
education
recognized
the
psychological
effects
on
children
when
they
are
subjected
to
segregation.
i
had
the
privileges
as
many
of
us
have,
of
attending
the
public
schools
and
i
really
mean
the
privilege
as
a
member
of
minority
group.
it
--
i
feel
has
done
things
for
my
character,
but
i'm
sure
that
the
psychiatrist
got
me
on
with
this
couch,
he
tell
me
that
he
had
also
done
things
to
his
psyche.
some
of
the
things
involved
in
this
case
are
very
subtle
psychological
matters.
for
example,
i
have
a
young
daughter
and
she
comes
home
from
school
and
due
to
the
conduct
of
this
maryland
ceremony,
she
has
the
belief
that
jesus
is
the
son
of
god.
it
so
happens
that
i
would
prefer
she
did
not
have
that
belief.
it
doesn't
worry
me
too
much.she'll
get
over
it.
she
will
have
her
sunday
school
training,
but
i
would
be
much
happier
if
the
schools
would
refrain
from
this
particular
ceremony.
many
people
feel
that
way.
the
point
is
that
william
murray
represents
catholics
perhaps,
in
a
protestant
area
where
the
catholics
find
the
douay
version
of
the
--
king
james
version
of
the
bible
offensive.
william
murray,
the
petitioner,
represents
protestants
in
a
catholic
area
where
perhaps,
the
catholics
decide
to
use
the
douay
version
of
the
bible.
william
murray
represents
humanists
who
have
filed
an
amicus
brief
here.
he
represents
minority
groups
of
numerous
sorts.
the
synagogue
council
of
america
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
members
of
the
jewish
faith.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
i
can't
recall
that
thing,
your
honor.
it
was
mentioned
in
a
case
of
this
court.
i
can't
recall
it.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
267,
which
was
the
first.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes.
and
the
majority
likes
to
go
along
thinking
that
they're
only
doing
what's
best
for
everybody.
they
overlooked
the
fact
that
because
they
are
the
majority,
the
minority
is
there
long-suffering
and
quiet
and
it's
only
when
william
murray
comes
along
that
this
thing
raises
its
head,
and
the
fact
that
the
case
was
brought
by
an
atheist,
which
is
perhaps
a
very
small
sect
in
this
country
does
not
mean
that
there
are
not
other
groups
as
evidenced
by
the
amicus
briefs,
who
feel
the
same
way.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
your
honor,
i
have
been
a
teacher
in
the
baltimore
public
schools
for
about
six
years
while
i
was
going
to
law
school
and
i've
also
been
a
student
in
the
public
schools.
that's
not
usually
done.
what
we
had
done
in
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
was
that
either
the
teacher
or
a
student
would
lead
the
class
in
reciting
in
unison
the
lord's
prayer
and
then
reading
a
section
from
the
bible.
most
teachers
will
either
pick
a
section
of
the
bible,
which
i
did
myself
when
i
was
teaching,
or
they
would
allow
a
child
to
do
so
invariably
and
the
bibles
which
were
provided
for
us
were
the
king
james
bible.
invariably,
in
my
experience,
i've
only
seen
the
king
james
bible
used.
i've
only
seen
the
king
james
bible
version
of
the
lord's
prayer
used.
whether
it's
used
anywhere
else,
i
don't
know,
but
i've
never
seen
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
it's
pretty
strongly
a
religious
verse,
“thus
be
it
ever
when
free
men
shall
stand”,
is
that
the
verse,
your
honor?
the
--
it's
my
favorite
verse,
it
so
happens.
it
certainly
has
a
highly
theistic
significance.
i
suppose
that
they
would
object
to
having
its
song
as
a
ceremony
set
forth
by
the
school
and
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
be
in
good
constitutional
ground.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
that
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
we
had
no
difficulty
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
--
whatever
improving
them.
the
demurrer
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor,
but
then,
to
quote
a
sage,
we
would
have
to
win
their
weary
way
back
here
again
probably
after
the
case
was
heard.
it
was
fortunate
for
us
that
the
case
was
heard
on
demurrer.
it
saved
us
a
great
deal
of
expense
in
printing
up
the
record.
but
the
case,
i
am
quite
sure,
would
be
no
different
in
its
aspect.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
i
can't
go
along
with
that,
if
your
honor
please,
because
here
is
a
prayer
which
is
taken
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
i
think
we
would
have
new
standing
if
we
had
no
detriment,
but
we
definitely
have
suffered
a
detriment.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
a
religion
has
been
established
and
as
a
result
of
the
establishment
of
that
religion,
my
client
has
been
treated
with
aversion
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
i
beg
your
pardon.
am
i,
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well
your
honor,
we
contend.
now,
i
may
be
entirely
wrong
on
my
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
that
if
this
prayer
is
a
sectarian
prayer
then
it's
an
establishment
of
religion.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
it
cause
a
detriment
--
causes
a
detriment
to
my
client
by
having
him
singled
out
and
denominated
as
one
who's
--
does
not
believe
in
this
particular
religion.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
no,
because
he
doesn't
believe
in
it.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
we
don't
contend
that
a
--
the
detriment
is
as
a
taxpayer.
now,
we've
been
rather
stubborn
about
that.
i
think
that
support
of
the
schools
doesn't
consist
in
six
cents
added
to
the
tax
rate,
it
consists
in
trust,
in
confidence,
in
the
feeling
that
you
can
send
your
children
to
the
schools
and
they'll
get
the
education
you
want.
they
won't
have
dogmas
thrust
upon
them.
we
don't
feel
that
that
is
--
we
certainly
have
not
alleged
or
shown
any
increase
in
the
tax
rate,
from
the
supplying
of
the
king
james
bible
and
the
time
it
takes,
the
detriment
or
the
psychological
effects,
the
young
william
murray
who
has
been
abused
because
of
his
belief.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
if
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
i
don't
understand
it,
your
honor.
if
the
establishment
of
religion
had
not
been
made,
he
would
not
have
been
abused.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
but
who
would
have
standing
to
challenge
it?
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
no
one
would
have
standing
to
challenge
it
if
they
--
if
there
were
no
members
of
any
minority.
but
with
these
267
sects
in
the
united
states,
we
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
they'd
have
a
suburb
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
no,
i
do
not
accept
it.
i'd
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
and
if
one
nonbeliever
came
into
the
county
and
started
a
case,
i
think
he'd
have
a
constitutional
right
to
have
the
ceremonies
halted.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
the
constitution
established
that.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
i
don't
feel
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
well,
there's
been
that
language
in
the
cases,
your
honor.
it
--
and
it
grates
on
me
every
time
i
read
them,
but
it's
probably
the
law.
i
don't
think
that
the
increment
in
taxes.
it's
like
the
farthingworth
versus
mellon
that
--
was
that
the
case
decided
that
there
was
such
an
insubstantial
increase
in
federal
income
tax
the
taxpayer
couldn't
object
to
grant
an
aid
to
a
state.
i
feel
that
our
constitutional
rights
are
worth
a
little
bit
more
than
a
six
cents
increase.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
temper
of
the
county.
now,
if
he
went
to
school
and
this
was
a
perfectly
ethical
county
and
no
one
sneered
at
him
and
no
one
rebuked
him
and
no
one
cast
aspersions
on
his
lack
of
belief,
he
would
not
be
able
to
come
into
court.
he
could
show
no
detriment.
but
if
it
were
otherwise,
then
i
think
that
he
could
require
that
the
constitution
be
brought
to
his
aid,
one
person
in
a
county.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
i
would
--
yes,
i
think
the
language
in
mcgowan
went
that
way,
your
honor;
that
economic
detriment
in
that
case
was
--
of
course
that
was
an
economic
situation
where
people
were
contending
that
because
they
had
to
close
on
sunday
they
couldn't
make
money
on
saturday
or
vice
versa,
i
forget.
but,
the
court
did
speak
in
that
case
in
terms
of
economic
detriment
as
to
the
establishment
clause.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
oh,
i
absolutely
did
not
intend
to
say
that,
your
honor.
i
--
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
j.
kerpelman
thank
you
your
honor.
