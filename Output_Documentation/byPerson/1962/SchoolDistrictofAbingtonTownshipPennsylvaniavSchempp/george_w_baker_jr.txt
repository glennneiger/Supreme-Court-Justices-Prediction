mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
comment
on
the
question
of
the
free
exercise
clause
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
about.
actually,
there
are
two
facets
to
the
first
amendment
as
it
applies
to
the
statute
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
one
is
the
--
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
i
think
this
court
as,
by
prior
decisions,
has
forced
us
to
--
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
--
concede
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
we
say
the
--
as
mr.
burch
has
covered
the
establishment
clause,
relates
to
the
church
state
in
the
relationship
and
to
what
extent
that
may
go.
the
free
exercise
clause
relates
to
compulsion
requiring
someone
to
do
something
which
is
contrary
to
his
beliefs.
if
the
establishment
clause
is
violated
then,
of
course,
the
free
exercise
may
be
immaterial.
if
the
establishment
clause
is
not
violated,
then
we
say
that
the
free
exercise
clause
is
not
violated
so
long
as
it
is
not
compulsory.
so
long
as
there
is
a
provision
under
which
a
person
may
be
excused.
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
taking
the
--
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
of
course
--
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
it
only
admits,
if
your
honor
please,
those
matters
which
are
well
pleaded
and
i
think
that
you
have
to
take
all
of
the
allegations.
i
might
say
this,
that
in
the
lower
court's
opinion,
you
will
notice
in
the
order
that
judge
prendergast
said
that
since
the
plaintiff
has
said
--
the
petitioner
has
said
that
it
could
not
improve
its
case
by
amending
the
petition,
therefore,
it
is
--
the
demurrer
is
sustained
without
leave
to
amend
but
there
was
that
opportunity.
now,
if
you
take
a
look
at
this
very
situation,
the
rule
is
set
forth
which
provides
for
the
excuse.
now,
this
is
no
different
than
barnette.
in
barnette,
a
petitioner
said
“i
am
required
to
pledge
allegiance.”
this
is
against
my
beliefs.
now,
this
court
didn't
strike
down
the
oath
of
allegiance.
all
this
court
said
was
that
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
he
is
entitled
to
be
excused
from
participation.
torcaso
was
a
similar
thing.
torcaso
--
this
court
didn't
say,
“no,
you
can't
give
an
oath
of
office.”
what
it
did
say,
“no,
you
can't
require
him
to
take
an
oath
of
office
in
order
to
be
a
notary
public.”
as
a
matter
of
fact,
article
1
of
the
constitution
provides
for
an
oath
of
office.
if
this
court
please,
i
was
sworn
in
as
a
member
of
this
court.
i
took
an
oath.
i
called
upon
god
to
witness
the
fact
that
i
would
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
that
i
would
conduct
myself
properly
in
this
court.
now,
clearly,
i
think
that
if
i
had
had
any
aversion
to
taking
that
oath,
that
i
would
not
have
been
required
to
do
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
you
could
conceive
of
a
situation
where
a
justice
of
this
honorable
court
might
find
that
it
offends
his
sensibilities
to
have
to
be
here
when
it
is
said
at
the
beginning
of
the
opening
exercises
of
this
court,
“god
save
the
united
states
and
this
honorable
court.”
now,
when
you
say
--
and
this
is
one
of
the
arguments
that's
raised
by
the
petitioner,
he
says,
“sure,
i
can
walk
away.
i
can
be
excused
but
this
holds
me
out
as
a
dissenter
and
i
lose
cast
and
everything
else.”
that
same
thing
could
happen
to
a
justice
of
this
very
court
who
might
object
to
the
invocation,
“god
save
this
honorable
court.”
suppose
he
objected
to
it.
he
just
wouldn't
come
in
while
that's
being
said.could
he
then
say
--
and
it
would
be
embarrassing
to
him,
i'm
--
i
would
imagine.
at
least
people
would
say,
“he's
different.”
but
would
he
have
the
right
to
say
that
this
court
cannot
have
that
invocation
because
it
offends
his
delicate
sensibilities?
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
quite
clear.
as
long
as
he
has
the
right
to
be
excused,
free
exercise
is
not
violated.
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
he
--
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
said
both
of
them
are
involved
--
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
but
that
if
you
--
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
i
say,
if
you
get
beyond
the
establishment
clause,
then
the
only
thing
--
then
that
--
if
it
doesn't
violate
the
establishment
clause
then
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
there's
no
violation
as
long
as
you
have
a
right
to
be
excused.
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
we
--
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
we
demurred
it
and
even
--
let
me
say
this,
that
anyone
who
dissents
runs
the
risk
of
disapproval.
justice
jackson
--
mr.
justice
jackson
in
mccollum
expressed,
i
think,
the
rule
there
so
very
well
when
he
said,
“it
maybe
doubted
whether
the
constitution,
which
of
course
protects
the
right
to
dissent,
can
be
construed
also
to
protect
one
from
the
embarrassment
that
attends
nonconformity
whether
in
religion,
politics,
behavior,
or
address.”
mr.
justice
douglas
in
zorach,
after
referring
to
a
similar
rule,
said
that
if
you
didn't
--
if
you
did
away
with
the
whole
thing
that
would
be
preferring
those
who
believe
in
no
religion
over
those
who
do
believe.
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
would,
before
concluding
my
time,
like
to
point
out
to
this
court
what
the
possible
consequences
of
the
petitioner's
view
would
lead
to.
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
in
zorach,
we
are
a
religious
people
whose
institutions
presuppose
a
supreme
being.
if
the
court
fails
to
draw
the
line
at
this
case,
there's
not
much
left.
a
pandora's
box
of
litigation
will
be
opened
with
inevitable
confusion
and
with
the
ultimate
result
that
the
court
will
be
required
to
remove
every
vestige
of
our
religious
traditions
from
public
life.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
these
would
all
happen
immediately,
but
those
who
now
clamor
for
getting
rid
of
these
opening
exercises
won't
stop
if
they
have
a
victory
here.
they
would
continue.justice
frank
--
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said
in
dissenting
in
barnette,
“i
am
not
burrowing
trouble
by
dumb
breaking
these
issues
nor
am
i
parading
horrible
examples
of
the
consequences
of
this
decision,
but
i'm
aware
that
we
must
decide
the
case
before
us,
not
some
other
case.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
a
case
is
disassociated
from
the
past
and
unrelated
to
the
future.
we
must
decide
this
case
with
due
regard
with
what
went
before
and
no
less
regard
with
what
may
come
after.”
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
i
think
you'd
have
--
you'd
have
the
question
as
to
the
use
of
coins,
“in
god
we
trust.”
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
well,
that
--
of
course,
you
go
back
to
--
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
mr.
justice
black,
it's
a
question
of
the
purpose.
as
mr.
burch
mentioned
--
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
i
think
if
the
decision
is
made
that
you
can't
have
this
--
as
a
part
of
the
opening
exercises
that
from
there
on
--
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
because
if
there
--
that
then
would
be
an
abuse.
the
purpose
is
the
same
as
the
implication
in
this
court,
“god
save
this
united
states
and
this
honorable
court.”
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
it's
the
same
thing
with
the
students.
sir?
mr.
george
w.
baker,
jr.
well,
but
if
you
went
on
for
an
hour
with
that,
it
would
be
the
same
thing,
if
your
honor
please.
thank
you.
