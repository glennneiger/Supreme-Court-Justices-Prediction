justice
potter
stewart
i
read
the
first
amendment.
i
had
never
read
that
language
in
it.
what's
it
say?
what's
the
first
amendment
say
in
this
subject?
justice
potter
stewart
but
here,
you
have
your
fourteenth
amendment
case,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
a
--
the
case
is
here
on
a
demurrer,
on
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
so,
there's
no
evidence
at
all
in
support
of
those
allegations
and
on
the
contrary,
there's
no
evidence
at
all
that
any
child
or
that
the
parents
of
any
child
wanted
their
children
in
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion,
wanted
their
children
to
say
this
morning
prayer
at
school,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
if
we
strike
this
provision
down,
we're
interfering
with
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion,
aren't
we?
justice
potter
stewart
your
entirely
free
under
these
regulations
to
your
client
to
just
walk
away
from
the
ceremony.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
says,
“any
child
shall
be
excused
from
participating
in
the
opening
exercises
or
from
attending
the
opening
exercises.”
justice
potter
stewart
“on
the
request
of
his
parent
or
guardian.”
justice
potter
stewart
you're
free
to
walk
away.
justice
potter
stewart
not
participate
in
any
way.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
one
--
of
course,
no
evidence
because
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
all
we
have
is
the
complaint
of
the
petitioner.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
sure?
i
was
assaulted
when
i
was
an
infant
at
school
many
times,
weren't
you?
i
mean,
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
may
be
no
connection
between
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
reason
i
asked
the
--
the
first
question
i
asked
you
sir
was
this,
that
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
provisions
affecting
and
relating
to
religion
in
the
first
amendment:
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause,
and
some
of
us
tend
to
lump
this
all
as
one
doctrine.
the
fact
is
that
these
two
separate
and
distinct
clauses
sometimes
run
into
conflict
with
each
other.
they're
not
one.
they're
two
different
things
and
in
some
areas,
they
conflict.
and
if,
as
you
say,
the
evidence
on
the
--
remanding
of
this
case
or
if
this
case
should
ever
be
tried,
if
the
evidence
should
show
that
the
mass
majority
of
the
children
in
the
baltimore
school
and
their
parents
want
to,
in
their
free
exercise
of
their
religious
beliefs,
want
to
open
their
school
day
with
prayer,
then
to
prevent
them
from
doing
that
would
be
to
interfere
with
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion.
isn't
that
correct?
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
very
literally.
justice
potter
stewart
precisely
but,
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
they
do
have
a
constitutional
right
to
pray
when
and
where
they
want
to
or
not
to
pray
if
they
don't
want
to.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
precisely
my
point.
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
question
here
of
any
disturbance
of
the
peace
or
disorderly
conduct,
we're
not
in
that
kind
of
an
area
in
this
case
at
all,
are
we?
justice
potter
stewart
and
if
the
sign
says,
“keep
off
the
grass”,
he
is
--
he
can
be
prohibited
from
walking
on
the
grass
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
even
if
he
wants
to
walk
on
it
to
make
a
speech.
but,
we're
not
in
that
--
this
isn't
that
kind
of
a
case
at
all,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
these
are
constitutional
rights
that
apply
to
all
of
us,
whether
we're
in
the
minority
or
the
majority,
whether
we're
1
or
whether
we're
a
1,000.
and,
i'm
only
suggesting
that
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause
often
run
--
collide
with
each
other.
they
run
head-on
into
each
other
and
it's
fallacious
to
consider
them
as
one
of
the
same
thing.
they're
two
separate,
distinct
provisions
of
the
constitution
and
they
often,
as
in
this
very
case,
if
you're
right
that
a
vast
majority
of
the
students
and
of
their
parents
affirmatively
want
to,
in
the
exercise
of
their
religious
beliefs,
want
to
open
their
school
day
with
prayer,
then
to
prevent
them
from
doing
it
in
the
name
of
the
establishment
clause
is
to
interfere
with
the
free
exercise
of
their
religion.
now,
i'm
not
suggesting
the
answer.
i'm
simply
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
suggesting
that
it's
a
fallacy
to
lump
all
this
together
and
say
it
all
just
stands
for
separation
of
church
and
state.
if
the
constitution
doesn't
say
so,
it
has
two
particular
specific
provisions.
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
they're
constitutional
provisions.
they're
a
sword,
if
you
want
to
call
them
a
sword,
they're
a
cloak
if
you
want
to
call
them
that,
but
they're
no
more
available
--
no
more
freely
available
to
the
majority
than
to
the
minority,
to
one
and
to
a
million.
it's
generally
minorities
who
invoke
these
rights
because,
usually,
majorities
don't
have
to.
justice
potter
stewart
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
provisions
are
equally
applicable
to
all
of
us.
justice
potter
stewart
the
complaint
there
rely
entirely
on
the
establishment
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
understand
that
you
can't
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
about
the
torcaso
case
and
i
join
you.
you're
entirely
free
to
disbelieve
in
god.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
--
you
have
a
constitutional
protection
to
disbelieve
in
god,
don't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
familiar
with
the
northwest
ordinance?
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
think
you're
--
there's
no
point
in
getting
an
argument
on
history,
but
i
think
the
religion
in
the
schools
have
historically
been
fairly
closely
connected
historically.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
99%
of
the
children
with
the
consent
for
participation
of
their
parents,
what
if
there
were
no
law,
no
baltimore
law
or
ordinance
whatsoever,
but
in
the
baltimore
school,
99%
of
the
students,
under
their
student
leadership
or
voluntarily
welled
up
within
the
class
have
decided
to
get
together
and
say
the
lord's
prayer
every
morning
before
they
begin,
got
to
school
two
minutes
early
or
three
minutes
early
and
said
the
lord's
prayer
there
in
the
classroom
every
morning
because
they
wanted
to?
justice
potter
stewart
well
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more
if
there
were
any
compulsion
--
is
there
any
compulsion
because
that
would
inters
--
interfere
with
the
free
exercise
of
the
religion
of
your
client
or
the
non-religion,
which
is
the
same
thing.
but
this
pro
--
this
statute
contains
a
specific
explicit
provision
that
you
can
walk
away
from
this.
justice
potter
stewart
then
shouldn't
this
--
might
it
not
be
wise
to
remand
this
case
to
take
evidence
as
to
see
whether
or
not
there
was
any
compulsion
on
your
client?
all
we
have
is
bear
allegations
now
of
your
pleading
admitted
by
the
demurrer
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
to
take
evidence
as
to
who
wanted
to
say
these
prayers
in
the
morning
and
with
whose
--
with
the
free
exercise
of
whose
religion
striking
down
this
ordinance
would
interfere.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there's
no
evidence
at
all
that
anybody
wants
to
say
this
prayer
now
(inaudible).
justice
potter
stewart
you're
going
to
get
around
a
demurrer.
on
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
your
pleading
on
a
demurrer
and
they
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
exercise
of
their
religious
beliefs.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
if
the
minority
wanted
to
had,
say
a
prayer
in
school?
justice
potter
stewart
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do
so,
don't
they,
so
long
as
they're
not
interfering
with
anybody
else?
justice
potter
stewart
but
each
one
of
us,
whether
they're--
whether
we're
1
or
whether
we're
10
million,
have
a
right
to
the
free
exercise
of
our
religion.
isn't
that
correct
under
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
help
to
talk
about
minorities
or
majorities
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
burch,
the
plaintiff
--
the
petitioner
--
or
two
petitioners,
the
--
william
j.
murray
iii
who
is
a
--
was
then
and
now
still
is
in
the
baltimore
school
system,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
suing
through
his
(inaudible),
his
mother,
and
his
mother,
individually,
is
also
a
petitioner.
justice
potter
stewart
and
they
both
alleged
that
they're
atheists,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
the
ordinances
or
rules
of
the
baltimore
school
system
interfere
with
the
exercise
of
their
belief
or
disbelief.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
child
is
still
in
the
school.
justice
potter
stewart
teacher
reads
it
in
each
classroom?
justice
potter
stewart
is
this
the
one
where
it's
a
broadcast
through
the
school
or
is
that
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
each
individual
classroom.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
a
student,
rather
than
the
teacher,
reads
the
bible?
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
have
a
record
here.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
difficulty
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
it
cannot
be
used
to
open
the
exercises
but
there's
nothing
there
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that
says
it
couldn't
be
used
to
close
them
or
at
any
time
during
the
exercises.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
don't
think
that
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
could
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
give
them
tranquilizer
pills
if
that's
the
only
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
purpose.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
burch
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
potter
stewart
you've
devoted
all
your
time
to
discussing
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
violates
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
insofar
as
that
provision
might
be
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
you
haven't
said
a
word
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
free
exercise
clause.
is
somebody
going
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
fine,
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
an
overstatement?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
concede
that
both
of
the
provisions
of
the
first
amendment
having
to
do
with
religion
are
incorporated
in
full
force
in
literal
terms
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
restrictions
on
the
states?
justice
potter
stewart
this
one
as
well?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
from
what
point
where
you
beginning.
justice
potter
stewart
the
difficulty
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
if
i
can
just
state
the
outsets,
then
perhaps
you
can
meet
my
difficulty.
the
difficulty
i
see
here
is
that
in
the
complaint,
if
that's
what
you
call
it
in
maryland
or
the
petition,
whatever,
it's
alleged
that
the
--
that
this
--
that
the
free
exercise
of
this
plaintiff's
religion
was
interfered
with
and
restrained
by
the
operation
of
this
board
of
education
rule,
and
all
you
have
is
a
demurrer
to
that
which,
by
its
terms,
admits
these
allegations.
now,
in
the
engel
against
vitale,
that
was
not
a
free
exercise
case,
neither
were
the
other
cases
which
my
brother
harlan
has
been
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
establishment
cases.
but
here,
you
have
a
clear
allegation
of
the
impairment
or
the
interference
of
the
free
exercise
of
this
person's
belief
or
religion,
if
you
will,
which
is
admitted
by
the
demurrer.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
i
--
i
know
that
there
is
that
right
expressed
in
the
amendment,
the
1960
amendment
to
the
rules
of
the
school
board,
but
these
allegations,
let's
say
in
effect,
that's
a
phony.
actually,
we
don't.
we're
not
free
of
compulsion
and
i
should
think
that
this
is
admitted
by
your
demurrer
and
this
would
require
a
trial
to
see
just
what
the
facts
were;
what
the
compulsions
were.
justice
potter
stewart
upon
an
atheist
to
conform
to
this
thing.
justice
potter
stewart
that
had
to
do
with
the
establ
--
excuse
me,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
attorney
general
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
attorney
general,
let's
assume
that
we
agreed
that
everything
was
--
everything
you
said
with
respect
to
the
establishment
clause
and
that's
all
that
was
involved
in
the
--
in
the
engel
versus
vitale,
do
you
say
you
disagree
with
that
decision,
as
you
--
perhaps,
now
i
did
also?
but,
you
have
a
different
case
here.
you
have,
here,
allegations
in
a
complaint
of
the
interference
with
the
free
exercise
of
this
petitioner's
religion.
that
was
completely
absent
in
the
engel
case,
completely.
that
case
involved
establishment
and
only
establishment.
but
here,
you
have
a
free
exercise
allegation
which
is
admitted
by
the
demurrer,
and
it
says
--
that
which
says,
in
effect,
that
despite
the
amendment
to
the
rule
of
1960
there
are
still
compulsions
upon
this
person.
in
engel
against
vitale,
it
was
held
by
the
new
york
courts
that
the
--
there
had
to
be
provision
under
that
system
for
the
complete
freedom
of
compulsion,
including
freedom
from
any
psychological
compulsion.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
its
part
isn't
it
of
the
--
of
the
complaint,
actually.perhaps
not,
but
i
know
it's
a
part
of
the
pleading.
justice
potter
stewart
these
are
clearly
sectarian,
unlike
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
unlike
the
prayer
in
engel,
which
is
(inaudible)
justice
potter
stewart
your
client
could
stand
there
and
think
about
his
disbelief
in
god.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
getting
somewhat
outside
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
what
page?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
if
you're
right
about
the
--
about
this
case
in
the
establishment
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
phase
of
it
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
then
i
would
agree
with
you.
justice
potter
stewart
but,
assume
you're
--
assume
one
should
disagree
with
your
position
that
these
rules
of
the
school
board
violate
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment
as
incorporated
in
the
fourteenth,
but
should
agree
that
on
the
allegations
of
your
complaint
these
rules
do
violate,
in
your
client's
case,
the
free
exercise
clause.
i
suppose
what
would
be
in
order
would
be
a
remand
for
a
trial,
wouldn't
it,
to
see
just
what
compulsions
there
are,
psychological
or
otherwise
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
conform.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
not
up
to
us
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
where
the
--
whether
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
should
be
difficult
or
easy
for
you
to
prove
them
or
from
the
other
side
to
disprove
them.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
would
be
the
appropriate
thing
to
do,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
what's
your
detriment,
speaking
purely
now
of
the
establishment
clause?
what
is
your
detriment?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
you're
getting
into
something
else,
aren't
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'm
just
asking
you.
the
establishment
clause
itself,
what
--
how
did
--
what
detriment
is
there?
in
other
words
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
not
talking
about
standing,
in
other
words.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
how
does
that
in
--
in
and
of
itself,
cause
a
detriment
to
your
client?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
--
because
it
interferes
with
his
free
exercise.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then,
what
--
then
how
does
it
--
well,
how
is
it
a
detriment,
as
a
taxpayer?
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
--
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
you
get
back
to
the
free
exercise.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
wouldn't
you
agree
with
this?
that
under
the
constitution,
it
would
--
no
state
could
--
and
no
city,
no
county
could
establish
a
church
even
though
100%
of
the
population
in
that
political
unit
wanted
to
do
it
and
there
were
no
non-conformers.
they
all
wanted
to
do
it.
still,
it
would
be
unconstitutional,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
what
i'm
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
my
question.
justice
potter
stewart
whether
without
--
whether
without
dissenters,
it's
absolutely
constitutionally
invalid
for
a
county,
assuming
that
county
were
100%
methodist,
all
of
them
wanted
an
official
methodist
church
and
established
one
in
smith
county,
maryland
or
x-county,
new
jersey,
that
would
be
completely
invalid
constitutionally,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now,
what
was
--
wouldn't
he
have
to
sue
as
a
taxpayer
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
would
be
his
detriment
if
he
came
to
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
right
would
he
be
asserting?
now,
let's
assume
my
imaginary
case
of
a
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
100%
methodist
and
they
set
up
an
official
methodist
church.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
county,
this
imaginary
county
in
an
imaginary
state.
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
nation.
and
then,
an
atheist
moves
into
the
county
and
he
continues
his
beliefs.
he
doesn't
go
to
church.
he
doesn't
go
near
it.
what
is
his
standing
to
object
to
that
justice
potter
stewart
well,
because
his
freedom
was
being
ex
--
interfered
with,
but
until
or
unless
that
happens,
he
has
no
standing
except
perhaps
as
the
taxpayer,
does
he?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
fact
is
he
did
not
ask
to
have
his
children
excused?
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
don't
know,
therefore,
what
effect,
if
any,
there
would
have
been
--
justice
potter
stewart
had
he
done
so?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that's
a
subject
(voice
overlap).
exactly
and
that's
all
we
have,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
did
i
understand
you
to
say
mr.
ward
before
you
proceed,
that
there
was
reliance
at
all
in
the
free
exercise
clause
in
the
court
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
before
us
now.
justice
potter
stewart
almost
later
i
guess.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this
is
--
these
are
broadcast
or
typed
from
one
place
in
the
school
to
every
classroom?
justice
potter
stewart
we're
talking
about
one
school
building
here?
justice
potter
stewart
in
this
school?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
in
the
record
as
i
understand
it
because
of
the
posture
of
the
case
as
to
what
would
happen
if
it
showed
up
or
showed
a
child
or
his
parents
take
advantage
of
the
statute
and
request
to
be
excused
from
this.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
his
subjective
prophecy.
justice
potter
stewart
without
that
there
is
nothing.
justice
potter
stewart
so
we,
we
don't
know
--
there's
no
evidence
at
all,
one
way
or
the
other
about
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
compulsions
or
coercive
forces
psychological
or
otherwise?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
would
you
say
so
if
there
were
statutory
provision
to
excuse
any
of
those
who
did
not
want
to
do
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
how
about
barnette,
the
barnette
case?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
it
didn't
but
if
they,
what
it
did
say
was
that
the
minersville
school
district
could
not
require
a
child
to
profess
a
certain
belief
or
either
pledge
of
allegiance
to
the
flag.
but
as
i
understand
that
case,
as
i
remember
it,
they
said
that
if
there
were
provision
to
excuse
any
child,
they
didn't
want
to
do
so
then
you
have
a
different
constitutional
question.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
if
there
were
evidence
to
that
then
there
wouldn't
be
an
effect
to
this
excusable
provision.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
assume
--
assume
there
were
excu
--
a
provision
by
which
a
child
could
be
excused
and
the
evidence
showed
beyond
doubt
that
there
was
absolutely
no
pressure
on
him
of
any
kind
psychological,
social
or
otherwise,
or
any
separation
or
stigma
of
any
kind
under
the
barnette
case
don't
you
think
that
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
it
might
well
be
constitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ward,
that
is
--
as
i
gather
or
do
i
correctly
gather
that
your
argument
contain
of
very
narrow
complex.
and
that
is
that
this
is
not
--
the
statute
does
not
require
a
religious
act.
that
if
we're
not
persuaded
by
your
argument
that
it
does
not
require
religious
act,
then
i
gather
you
concede
that
this
religious
act
notwithstanding
the
provision
for
excusable
to
the
children
is
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
i
should
add
then,
it's
only
if
we
were
able
to
conclude
that
the
statute
requires
in
a
religious
act
no
different
from
the
religious
act
required
in
engle
that
you
concede
its
unconstitutionality
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
notwithstanding
the
provision
for
excuses.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let's
assume
--
let's
assume
there
was
no
statute
here.
but
that
the
--
they
had
a
student
government
in
this
abington
township
high
school
which
is
fairly
typical
with
many
public
high
schools.
and
--
and
the
students
voted
overwhelmingly
that
they
wanted
to
begin
their
day
by
having
one
of
their
number
perhaps
on
rotating
basis,
read
ten
verses
from
the
bible
which
every
bible,
the
particular
student
reader
shows
that
morning
and
to
begin
the
school
day.
and
that
they
--
and
then
there
was
--
this
was
attack
of
the
constitution
and
there
was
evidence
from
all
of
these
people
who
voted
that
our
religious
beliefs
tell
us
we
want
to
do
this
in
the
free
exercise
of
our
religion.what
kind
of
case
would
you
have
then?
justice
potter
stewart
i
asked
the
question
just
from
the
facts.
justice
potter
stewart
i
may
get
the
facts
as
i
go
along.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
addressing
yourself
historically
to
a
matter
of
a
--
the
wisdom
or
unwisdom
of
virginia's
policy.
other
states
have
different
policies.
massachusetts,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
had
an
established
church
well
into
the
19th
century,
(voice
overlap)
the
congregational
church.
it's
a
matter
of
wisdom
or
unwisdom,
and
what
a
state
might
want
to
do
by
its
organic
law
or
by
its
statutory
law,
is
something
else.
what
we're
talking
about
is,
is
the
federal
constitution
and
what
that
requires
the
state
to
do
or
not
to
do?
justice
potter
stewart
certainly
it
requires
a
state
to
respect
the
free
exercise
of
the
religion
of
every
inhabitant
of
that
state,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
it
true
that
states,
every
state
helps
religion
in
a
multitude
of
ways.
it
gives
them
fire
protection,
police
protection.
it
gives
them
the
usually
tax
exemption
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
only
religion?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
would
--
what
would
be
his
standing?
justice
potter
stewart
let's
assume
he
was
treated
economically
and
socially
and
personally
with
the
greatest
respect
and
courtesy
that
he
could
show
no
economic
detriment,
absolutely
no
social
stigma,
nothing.
and
that
he
was
completely
free
in
that
community
to
practice
his
active
atheism,
his
nonbelief
completely
so
and
he
respected
his
rights
to
do
that
in
that
community.
what
standing
would
he
have
to
complete?
justice
potter
stewart
i
agree
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
agree
with
you
that
it
would
be
grossly
unconstitutional
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
but
what
would
your
standing
be?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
suggesting
it
would
beyond
constitutional
for
the
men
of
philadelphia
if
he
was
so
disposed
and
if
he
could
get
the
--
or
pay
for
it,
now
the
radio
time
to
say
ten
--
read
ten
verses
from
the
bible
over
the
radio
every
morning?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
each
one
of
the
counsel
men
can
do
it,
couldn't
he,
if
he
wanted
to?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
i'm
saying.
but
he's
got
a
constitutional
right
to
do
it.
justice
potter
stewart
torcaso
is
a
free
exercise
case.
justice
potter
stewart
was
it
not?
very
clearly
it's
a
free
exercise
case.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
you
read
this
last
summer
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
would
you
say
barnette
was
a
free
exercise
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understood
but
to
--
but
to
that
particular
sect,
it
violated
their
writ
and
their
own
religious
principle
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
salute
the
flag.
there
are
many
other
examples
beside
those
you
gave
whether
it's
a
clear
conflict
between
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause,
prison,
state
prison,
federal
prisons.
justice
potter
stewart
i
gather
that
you
suggested
in
your
answer
that
if
there
were
conflict,
or
at
least
be
in
that
context
where
there
is
a
conflict,
if
you
had
engaged
for
you
with
the
judge
you
would
think
the
free
exercise
clause
should
prevail
over
the
establishment
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
which
was
the
first
decision
of
this
court
which
held
at
the
fourteenth
amendment
embodied
or
absorbed
the
establishment
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
which
one?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
cantwell
involved
the
--
it
actually
involved
the
free
exercise.
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
think
you're
right
in
dictum
and
often
said
the
whole
--
that
both
were
incorporated.i
was
wondering
which
case
it
was
actually
involved.
everson
was
it
or
was
there
--?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
as
we
all
know,
well
as
we've
said
earlier,
the
state
used
long
after
the
adoption
of
the
first
amendment,
many
states
had
actual
established
religions
and
the
good
many
historians
think
that
one
of
the
very
reasons
for
the
establishment
clause
in
the
first
amendment
was
to
be
sure
that
the
federal
government
didn't
establish
the
church
and
to
leave
the
states
free
to
establish
their
churches
if
they
wanted
to,
or
not
to
if
they
didn't
want
to.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
the
local
the
local
option
--
the
local
option
idea.but
now
we
know
that
the
court
has
held
that
at
least
that
free
exercise
part
of
the
first
amendment
and
the
--
and
at
least
to
some
extent
the
establishment
clause
part
of
the
first
amendment
has
been
absorbed
by
the
fourteenth,
and
i
wonder
which
case,
was
it
the
everson
case
(voice
overlap)
justice
potter
stewart
there
was
the
louisiana
school
book
case,
wasn't
there?
well,
perhaps
we
won't
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
it,
i
think.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
a
relatively
--
it's
a
relatively
recent
doctrine,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
we
agreed
earlier
that
was
a
free
exercise
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
as
torcaso?
justice
potter
stewart
you
have
engle.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sawyer,
the
district
court
didn't
give
any
attention
at
all
to
the
claim
that
the
statute
interfered
to
the
free
exercise
of
the
plaintiff's
religion.
justice
potter
stewart
it
just
didn't
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
decided
the
case
entirely
on
the
establishment
clause.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
--
is
there
any
evidence
at
all
in
the
record
outside
of
the
father's
--
the
father's
subjective
prophecy
as
to
what
actually
happens
to
any
child
who
wants
to
be
excused
and
not
to
listen
to
this
or
just
nothing?
justice
potter
stewart
we
don't
know
that
he
would
or
then
anybody
would
have
to
pray
--
to
pay
that
price
or
any
other
price
on
the
evidence
in
this
record.
justice
potter
stewart
that
under
the
--
under
the
existing
system
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
agree.
you're
arguing
(voice
overlap)
makes
sense
but
there's
no
evidence
as
to
what
actually
would
happen
to
any
child
who
after
the
--
who
has
just
not
to
have
any
part
of
this.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
certainly
--
we
can
not
assume,
we
can
not
assume
that
there
would
not
be
psychological
or
social
pressures,
but
i
don't
know
that
we
can
assume
that
there
would
be
either
when
the
absence
of
evidence,
can
we?
justice
potter
stewart
now
then,
that
wasn't
court
doing
it?
justice
potter
stewart
this
might
become
a
stylish
thing
in
school,
not
to
listen
to
that
during
prayer
every
morning,
and
then
--
then
there'd
be
a
conformist,
you
wouldn't
listen
to
the
prayer.
justice
potter
stewart
who
has
the
right,
the
child
or
the
parent?
justice
potter
stewart
didn't
he
get
--
does
he
have
a
constitutional
right
to
do
that?
justice
potter
stewart
--
some
interested
in
it
and
believing
in
it.
