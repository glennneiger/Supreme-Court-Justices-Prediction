justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
the
version
of
the
lord's
prayer
actually
in
the
record?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
noticed
that
in
the
regular
--
the
section,
douay
version
may
be
used
by
those
pupils
who
prefer
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
how
they
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
burch
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(inaudible)
under
section
6,
are
arguing
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
section
6
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
would
not
--
section
6
preclude
reading
from
the
koran?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
says,
“shall
be
opened
by
the
reading
of
a
chapter
in
the
holy
bible
and/or
the
use
of
the
lord's
prayer.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that
might
be
interpreted
to
authorize
that
reading
from
the
koran?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
burch,
chief
justice
(inaudible)
that
this,
there
seems
to
be
no
substantial
room
for
dispute
that
the
reading
of
passages
from
the
bible
and
the
recital
of
the
lord's
prayer
are
christian
religious
exercises.
now,
is
there
anything
in
the
court
opinion
below
which
takes
issue
of
that
conclusion
here,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
didn't
have
the
concern
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
chief
judge
(inaudible)
did
it.
chief
judge
(inaudible)
had
no
difficulty
concluding
the
religious
exercises.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
court
opinion
which
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
find
anything
in
the
court
opinion
which
takes
issue
of
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
mr.
baker.
this
is
an
interruption,
i'm
sorry.
did
i
understand
you
to
suggest
to
mr.
justice
stewart
that
the
only
question
here
by
reason
of
the
allegation
for
this
petition
and
the
demurrer
is
a
free
exercise
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
establishment
question
is
also
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
on
these
allegations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
a
conclusion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
the
reason,
you
think,
the
provisions
excused
them,
had
the
petitioners
in
mind
to
keep
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
say,
“those
who
make
the
provision
for
the
excuse
have
only
atheist
in
mind?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
they
didn't
like
the
protestant
version
or
protestants
who
didn't
like
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
douay
version.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
ward
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ward,
may
i
ask,
but
this
is
teaching
from
which
students
may
excuse
themselves,
i
gather,
under
the
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
excuse
them
for
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
why
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
if
that's
all
you're
doing,
is
teaching
morality
or
face
the
flag
and
salute
for
patriotism,
why
do
you
treat
the
subjects
differently
when
you
do
arithmetic,
geography,
or
anything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
i'm
getting
to
is,
is
it
consistent
with
your
insistence
that
all
you're
doing
is
teaching
morality
that
you'll
excuse
them
from
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
fact
that
you
do
excuse
them,
it
does
throw
impression,
doesn't
it,
whether
in
fact
all
you're
doing
is
teaching
morality?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
would
say,
i
would
suppose
it
was
a
--
so
--
it's
a
very
good
thing,
perhaps.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
even
in
some
respects
of
rather
more
important
than
teaching
requisites.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
--
in
fact
all
you're
doing,
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
why
--
why
as
i
gather
under
your
statute
is
the
case
the
whole
the
class
can
excuse
itself.
the
whole
school
can
excuse
itself.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
but
there's
no
first
amendment
in
the
constitution
of
iraq.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
yes
these
children
are
together.
they
are
together.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
isn't
that
a
gross
--
isn't
that
a
gross
interference
with
the
free
exercise
of
the
religion
of
those,
in
my
imaginary
case,
those
98%
of
the
student
body
who
say,
“our
religious
beliefs
tell
us
that
this
is
what
we
want
to
do.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
sawyer
what
--
have
you
said
in
this
word
of
argument
that,
well
even
if
it
is
religion,
it's
religious
tradition.
