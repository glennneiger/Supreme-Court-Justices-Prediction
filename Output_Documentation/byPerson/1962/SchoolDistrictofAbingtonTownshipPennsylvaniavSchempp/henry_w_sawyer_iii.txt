mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
that
mr.
ward
has
completely
stated
the
procedural
history
of
the
case
and
i'll
not
repeat
that.
and
for
the
most
part,
i
believe
it's
fairly
and
most
fairly
covered
the
facts
of
the
case.
well,
i
would
like
to
comment
in
one
or
two
particular
along
the
evidence,
and
one
or
the
two
of
the
facts
of
the
case
which
i
think
needs
some
comment.
first
of
all,
i
think
it
should
be
quite
clearly
understood
that
the
particular
practice
described
by
one
of
the
witnesses
who
are
the
school
district
who
run
the
radio
and
the
television
workshop
was
characterized
by
the
lower
court
as
an
exception.
and
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
in
the
other
schools
of
abington
township
where
these
children
went,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
first
trial
was
held,
the
practice
is
typical
of
the
commonwealth
in
general.
and
if
it
makes
any
difference
and
that
is
that
the
teachers
generally
read
the
ten
verses
of
--
or
in
the
alternative
assign
it
to
some
child
in
rotation,
you
don't
have
the
public
address
system.
and
in
fact
on
cross
examination,
the
teacher
who
described
that
practice
conceded
that
it
was
only
his
own
individual
innovation
which
had
prompted
him
to
suggest
that
since
the
children
might
well
read
better
from
the
radio
techniques
then
point
as
he
put
it.
if
they
had
a
chance
to
practice,
they
might
use
at
home
their
own
bibles
and
then
come
in
and
use
them.
but
it
--
if
that
makes
any
difference,
i
think
the
lower
court
was
quite
right
in
saying
that
that
would
only
mean
that
you'd
established
a
number
of
religions
or
religion
generally.
and
in
fact,
we
never
did
find
out
from
that
witness
what
the
jewish
children
did
about
the
lord's
prayer
because
they
leave
that
too,
you
see
over
the
pa
system
since
the
lord's
prayer
isn't
in
their
bible.
now,
the
other
point
that
i
would
make
is
this
question
of
where
does
the
lord's
prayer
stand
in
this
case?
it's
quite
true
it
is
not
mandated
by
the
statute.
however,
the
record
shows
on
page
99,
i
refer
to
the
testimony,
although
witness
for
the
school
district,
and
it
was
introduced
into
evidence
by
the
school
district,
a
book
called
‘the
employees'
handbook
and
administrative
guide.
and
the
witnesses'
attention
was
direct
to
the
portion
which
refers
to
“teachers-professional
obligations”.
and
it
states
there
that
the
first
professional
obligation
is
to
comply
with
the
state
regulation
in
reading
at
least
ten
verses
of
scripture
each
morning
without
comment.
this
is
to
be
followed
by
the
lord's
prayer.
now,
that
is
a
part
of
the
hearing
which
took
place
before
the
amendment
of
the
statute.
but
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
this
regulation
in
any
way
has
been
changed.
and
i
don't
know
why
it
would
be
changed,
because
the
amendment
of
the
statute
didn't
affect
this
lord's
prayer
practice.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
that's
on
page
99,
mr.
justice
harlan.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
it
doesn't.
right.
we
can
contend,
of
course,
that
the
injunction
bars
it
now.
you
can't
read
the
lord's
prayer
because
it's
a
part
of
the
--
it's
a
part
of
the
--
of
the
new
testament,
part
of
the
bible.
but
it
is
apparently
according
to
this,
this
is
a
state
wide
publication,
it's
mandated
at
least
by
that
rule.
and
i
also
call
it
that
your
attention
to
that
passage
in
deciding
whether
this
is
compulsory
now
that
the
school
district
always
calls
this
a
voluntary
bible
reading
statute.
there's
nothing
voluntary
about
the
bible
reading.
the
bible
reading
is
mandated
by
the
legislature.
the
language
is
it
shall
be
read.
and
as
the
lower
court
found
in
spite
of
the
repealer
of
this
specific
provision
in
that
statute
saying
a
teacher
would
be
dismissed
if
he
declined
or
neglected.
this
public
school
code
takes
care
of
that.
and
as
the
lower
court
as
mr.
--
as
chief
justice
biggs
found,
chief
judge
biggs
in
his
opinion,
he
stated
that
under
the
public
school
code
since
there
is
a
clause
that
says,
“a
willful
violation
of
the
school
laws
is
punishable
by
dismissal,”
it
seemed
at
least
quite
clear
to
him
and
it
would
seem
quite
clear
to
me
that
a
teacher
could
not
refuse.
i
don't
think
that
that
--
the
case
turns
on
whether
the
teacher
could
refuse.
this
isn't
the
teacher,
but
i
--
i
wish
to
set
the
record
state
--
straight
in
that
respect.
now,
we
--
we
claim
that
the
practice
is
not
voluntary
in
any
sense
which
applies
at
least
to
the
establishment
clause.
it
is
compulsory.
it
will
come,
if
we
may,
in
a
minute,
to
that
what
happens
and
what
the
effect
is
of
an
excused
provision.
let
me
say
to
all
that
it's
also
quite
clear
from
the
evidence
that
the
schempps
do
not
take
the
position
that
was
referred
to
hearing
the
brief.
i
really
think
that
the
brief
was
quoted
out
of
context.
the
schempps
testified,
children
and
father
alike,
of
specific
creedal,
doctrinal
religious
beliefs
of
theirs
as
taught
in
their
family
and
in
their
church
that
were
opposed
by,
if
you
will,
contrary
to
specific
things
that
had
been
read
from
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible.
since
they
are
unitarians,
the
most
obvious
one
is
the
concept
of
the
trinity
and
the
concept
of
unity.
this
is
--
this
is
the
--
the
most
obvious,
but
there
were
others.
mr.
schempp
said
that
he
didn't
wish
his
children
to
get
the
concept
of
--
as
he
put
it
a
god
of
vengeance.
the
old
testament
god,
the
jealous
god
who
demands
blood
sacrifices,
and
says,
“if
you
don't
correct,
do
them
properly.”
and
this
is
leviticus.
if
you
don't
do
them
properly,
then
the
punishment
comes
upon
you
and
your
children.
and
i
question,
we
come
to
this
question
of
the
bible's
morality.
of
course
there
are
morality
teachings
in
the
bible.
and
of
course
those
things
which
i
frankly
say,
i
think
would
offend
present
day
morality.
i
have
no
hesitations
in
saying
that,
because
to
an
adult
or
with
teaching,
they
can
be
explained
as
a
great
evolving
concept
to
these
people,
first
towards
monotheism
then
to
rid
themselves
of
these
practices
left
over
from
pagan
times.
and
finally,
it
will
evolve
into
a
concept
of
god,
certainly
the
god
at
the
end
even
of
the
new
testament
is
not
the
god
of
the
beginning
of
the
new
testament,
but
the
children
can't
separate
this.
i'm
not
sure
it's
morality
particularly
to
tell
the
children
that
i'm
just
--
and
i'm
only
picking
things
that
were
in
this
record.
i
mean,
you
could
go
at
random
through
the
bible,
but
mr.
schempp
says,
“when
the
bible
says
if
it
--
animal
dies
within
your
gaze
speed
and
not
to
those
within
your
greats
but
to
the
strangers
outside.
now,
this
doesn't
seem
like
morality
to
me.
now,
this
can
be
explained.it
just
so
happened
that
that
particular
thing
was
cited
and
then
dr.grayzel,
a
jewish
expert
said,
well
this
can
be
explained.
i
won't
go
to
the
explanation,
but
there
is
one.
now,
this
is
a
different
thing
with
the
explanation,
but
the
young
children
--
one
wonders
whether
this
is
necessarily
--“
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
--
such
morality
without
explanation
as
the
reading
of
the
bible
alone
will
ensure
good
morals.
mr.
schempp
pointed
out
the
right
in
the
ten
commandments.
there's
a
verse
that
says
that
if
one
of
them
or
perhaps
all
of
them
is
broken,
then
the
sin
be
upon
the
children
under
the
fourth
generation.
that
isn't
his
morality.
and
i'm
sure
that
can
be
explained.
but
it
isn't
his
morality.
and
reading
that
without
comment
is
not
the
kind
of
concept
even
moral.
and
i
really
submit
you
cannot
separate
the
two
in
this
context.
you
cannot
separate
the
moral
levin
from
the
religious
levin
in
the
bible.
i
think
the
two
go
absolutely
together.
and
it
teaches
--
they
say
it
doesn't
cross
through
the
type.
it
teaches
--
the
book
teaches
from
the
opening
chapter
of
genesis
to
the
last
chapter
of
revelations.
it
teaches
--
it
teaches
the
way
the
world
was
created.
and
i
think
it
teaches
in
the
sectarian
sense
from
the
opening.
from
the
very
open,
it
says
“and
lo
the
spirit
was
upon
the
orders”.
and
in
the
king
james
version
and
i'm
sure
the
douay
version,
that
word
is
capitalized.
it
means
the
holy
ghost.
this
is
the
beginning
of
a
teaching
of
a
concept
of
trinity.
it
teaches
--
the
new
testament
is
a
teaching
message.
when
jesus
said,
“others
have
said
unto
you,
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth.
but
i
say
unto
you
thou
shall
resist
not
evil.
if
one
smites
thee
upon
one
cheek”,
and
so
on,
this
is
teaching.
and
it
was
a
highly
controversial
teaching.
then
and
i
submit
to
your
honors,
it's
highly
controversial
teaching.
now,
men
do
not
agree
about
these
things.
and
what
i
said
in
my
brief
was
that
to
dismiss
these
differences
as
mere
quibbles
to
say,
“well,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.”
it's
really
as
the
attorney
general
of
maryland
said
a
question
of
theism
or
nontheism
is
to
find
a
face
of
hundreds
of
years
of
history
in
bloodshed,
i
submit,
for
the
religious
history.
and
i
said
there
that
that
is
--
to
do
that
is
to
deny
the
validity
to
many
and
the
value
of
specific
creedal,
religious
belief.
not
religion
in
general.
not
a
kind
of
generalized
theism
which
is
suitable
to
some,
but
not
to
others.
and
i
said
that
to
do
that
is
to
lead
to
a
foster
of
kind
of
colorless
national
public
school
creed.
but,
i
don't
say
that's
what
they're
doing.
it's
those
who
make
the
argument,
there's
no
one
here
but
us
theist.
we're
just
reading
some
lessons
of
morality,
i
submit
to
tend
to
do
that.
and
i
submit
that
it
isn't
the
function
of
government,
school
districts.
it
isn't
the
function
of
--
even
forces
in
society
to
ensure
that
these
religious
differences
of
america
shall
somehow
be
sort
of
blurred
and
sickle
over.
and
we'll
come
out
with
this
kind
of
morality.
i
don't
think
that's
the
business
of
the
public
schools
particularly,
but
it's
a
tenancy
behind
this
kind
of
practice
when
it's
justified
in
this
way.
and
of
course,
it
must
be
because
to
say
otherwise
is
to
admit
it
for
what
it
is
and
for
what
the
legislation
so
clearly
intended.
they
didn't
single
out
another
single
work
in
the
range
of
the
world's
literature.
and
there
are
other
sources
of
morality.
not
one
other
book
in
all
the
range
of
the
world's
religious
and
secular
of
the
literature
is
singled
out
by
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
to
be
read.
how
many?
ten
verses.
it
shall
be
read,
how?
without
comment.
this
--
this
is
--
this
is
unique
to
start
with.
now
to
be
sure,
the
legislature
said,
“well
we
do
this
for
secular
purpose.”
and
i
think
that
all
establishments
are
nominally
done
for
a
secular
purpose.
at
least
since
the
middle
ages,
i
suggest
there's
never
been
an
establishment.
and
i
mean
real
complete
establishment
such
as
you
have
in
england,
you
have
in
scandinavian
countries
where
their
churches
such
as
you
have
in,
shall
we
say,
italy
or
spain.
there
has
never
been
an
establishment
in
modern
times
which
purported
to
be
an
establishment
in
order
to
convert
men
to
the
doctrine,
but
rather
to
improve
their
ways,
because
isn't
it
true
that
the
majority,
and
they're
the
ones
who
are
in
the
position
to
have
an
establishment
always
say,
and
they
must
assume,
well
it's
not
only
our
religion
that
is
so
effective,
but
you
know,
our
particular
religion
just
has
a
way
of
making
men
better
than
other
religions.
and
therefore,
it's
to
the
good
of
the
state
to
have
it
established.
then
i
suggest,
in
answer
to
your
honor,
justice
stewart's
question,
that
leads
me
very
close.
i'd
like
to
try
to
answer
them.
you
haven't
put
it
to
me,
but
you
put
it
to
one
counsel
yesterday.
and
you
said
these
are
not
inherited
in
this
situation,
a
conflict
between
a
free
exercise
clause
and
the
establishment
clause.
and
i
think
not
for
this
reason.
i
do
not
think
that
the
free
exercise
clause
--
well,
first
of
all
let
me
say,
of
course,
it
can
not
prevent
people
from
praying.
i
mean
people
could
pray
and
they
pray
and
nobody
stops
them
from
praying
as
such.
the
question
is,
is
it
a
constitutional
right
under
the
free
exercise
clause
to
have
the
state
conduct
the
prayer
or
to
pray
in
other
words
under
the
ejus
of
the
state?
and
i
think
clearly
not,
even
if
the
overwhelming
majority
has
so
feel,
i
think
it
probably
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
of
majority.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
may
i
ask?
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
is
this
a
case
where
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
of
course,
yes
sir.
but
--
do
they
--
does
the
school
--
do
the
school
authority
said
--
say,
“well
then,
certainly
you
can
use
the
pa
system
and
we'll
get
the
children
together.”
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
what
were
they
doing
otherwise?
i
mean,
--
i'll
answer
it
this
way.
if
and
pursuant
to
that,
the
school
authority
say,”
yes,
you
may
use
the
pa
system.
we'll
have
the
children
doing
not
something
else
at
the
time
in
the
classrooms.”
now,
i
say
that
it's
an
establishment
nonetheless,
not
so
crucial
one,
but
an
establishment
not
the
--
but
if
they
say
during
recess,
all
children
who
would
like
to
come
and
listen
to
ten
verses
being
read
in
an
empty
classroom
or
somewhere
around
the
school
grounds,
instead
of
going
in
the
recess,
we're
going
to
read
it
everyday,
fine.
the
difference
is
the
imprimatur
and
the
--
and
the
ejus
of
the
state.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
the
origin
makes
that
much
difference.
of
course,
it's
grosser
if
the
legislature
does
it.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
they
have
a
right
to
do
it,
your
honor,
but
they
haven't
got
a
right
to
get
the
state
to
help
them.
it's
the
same
--
i
think
it
comes
back
to
the
--
to
the
same
question
as
--
as
confronted
madison
and
jefferson
in
virginia,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
virginians
at
the
time
of
the
assessment
bill
were
christians.
and
they
--
they
wanted
the
state
to
help
them
establish
teachers,
but
equally
--
absolutely
equally.
and
they
had
an
excused
provision
because
as
the
assessment
bill
was
finally
--
in
its
final
form
in
the
virginia
legislature
provided
that
it
didn't
want
to
give
to
any
religious
group,
if
it
designate
for
secular
educational
purposes.
perfectly
voluntary
in
that
sense,
that's
how
they
were
describing.
and
the
overwhelming
majority
wanted
this.
and
they
wanted
it
interesting
enough
for
the
same
reasons
because
they
said
religion
had
the
tendency
to
correct
the
morals
of
men
at
least
the
good
citizenship
just
the
same
as
pennsylvania
now
says.
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
madison
saw
two
fallacies
in
this,
your
honor.
one
was,
he
said,
“who
does
not
see
that
that
authority
which
can
establish
christianity?”
all
of
it
now,
and
this
is
99%
surely
of
virginians
then,
established
christianity,
the
exclusion
of
other
sects
may
with
the
same
authority
establish
one
sect
of
christianity.
secondly,
he
saw
that
it's
deeper
than
that.
it's
deeper
than
that.
it's
--
that
the
state
should
not
use
religion
for
its
ends
and
that's
what
the
--
the
solicitor
general
baltimore
tells
me
they're
doing.
they
want
to
have
discipline
and
authority
that
he
says
at
the
beginning
of
the
day.
to
that
i
say,
“yes,
precisely.”
that
is
the
state
now
using
religion.
where
should
virginia
use
the
state?
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
i
--
i
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
it
does
indeed,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
correlative
of
that
is
that
free
exercise
means
that
you
enlist
the
state
to
help
you
exercise.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
of
course
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
our
protection
is
of
course
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
because
a
boardroom
next
door
might
catch
one
if
the
church
burn.
but
the
tax
advantage
is
certainly
--
certainly
a
--
favorite
words
that
--
but
that's
a
refraining
even
there
from
an
affirmative
act
of
taxation
--
unfortunately,
we
haven't
got
that
case.
and
i
would
say,
i
would
like
to
disassociate
myself
with
the
view
that
once
you
find
any
kind
of
possible
encroachment
of
the
first
amendment
that
all
encroachments
are
of
equal
weight,
i
think
that
you
may
have
been
voiced
yesterday.
i
suppose
if
the
religious
clause
of
the
first
amendment
comes
as
close
to
an
absolute
as
any
we
have,
but
i
submit
that
there
is
no
absolute
--
absolute
known
to
the
anglo-saxon
law.
and
even
this
one
must
give
way
to
the
doctrines
of
de
minimis,
which
i
think
clearly
applied
that
rubrics
on
the
coins.
does
anybody
really
suppose
that
any
court
at
any
level
could
entertain
from
the
standpoint
of
standing
or
de
minimis,
or
to
put
another
way
doesn't
have
the
wit
as
lawyers
trained
in
the
anglo-saxon
tradition
of
de
minimis
standing
to
get
rid
of
a
case
like
that?
who
can
complain?
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
just
that
the
incursion
there
is
so
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
i
think
even
the
religious
clause
of
the
first
amendment
is
subject
to
the
doctrine
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
--
at
some
point
of
de
minimis.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
i
cannot
separate,
your
honor.
i
really
--
i'm
not
convincing
but
i
really
think
that
you
can't
separate
what
a
court
will
do
from
what
the
first
amendment
forbids.
i
think
under
our
system
of
ad
hoc
decisions
of
judicial
parsimony,
you
can't
really
theoretically
separate
--
in
other
words,
there
cannot
be
any
violation
of
the
first
amendment
in
vacuo.
there
can
only
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
in
terms
of
a
justifiable
issue.
and
that
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
i
could
not
--
well,
not
a
religious
exercise.
no,
sir,
but
i
think
it's
a
religious
declaration.
i
couldn't
handedly
say
that.
i
just
think
that
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
that
was
i
was
trying
to
say.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i'd
like
to
say
another
word
about
the
testimony.
i
don't
think
that
we
should
gloss
over
these
doctrinal
and
sectarian
differences.
i
think
they're
profound
and
i
think
you
have
it
here.
i'm
speaking
again
now
really
in
terms
of
free
exercise,
i
suppose,
at
least
in
terms
of
detriment.
i
refer
or
to
take
as
my
text
at
least,
the
testimony
of
dr.
grayzel.
now,
this
isn't
--
he's
said
here
yesterday
that
there
are
some
minor
doctrinal,
minor
differences
in
these
versions
of
the
bible
and
the
counsel,
i
believe,
even
lumped
in
the
jewish
holy
scriptures
were
minor
differences.
the
new
testament,
the
concept
of
christ,
a
man
who
historically
lived
as
being
the
son
of
god
is,
as
dr.
grayzel
testified
to
judaism,
a
blasphemy.
this
was,
in
fact,
christ's
crime.
it
is
a
blasphemy.
you
can't
gloss
this
over
by
saying
there
are
some
minor
differences.
he
pointed
out
that
there's
ridicule
of
the
jewish
hierarchy
throughout
the
new
testament.
he
pointed
out
that
--
think
of
it
gentlemen,
the
scene
of
the
trial
of
jesus
before
pilate.
he
said
this
has
been
where
the
multitude
christ
not
for
barabbas,
but
for
jesus
and
pilate
washes
his
hands
and
the
version
exculpates
the
romans
for
the
death
of
christ.
and
then
the
jews
say
and
they've
so
described
they
say,
“his
blood
be
upon
us
and
our
children.”
and
dr.
grayzel
said
that
sentence
has
been
responsible
for
more
anti-semitism
and
any
single
sense
in
history
i
can't
doubt
it.
and
i
don't
think
we'll
--
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
it
shouldn't
--
shouldn't
be
said
and
cannot
read
the
new
testament
in
those
eyes,
not
the
way
perhaps
some
of
us
read
it,
without
this
kind
of
thought
of
all
in
our
minds
or
had
it
read
to
us
without
realizing
that
it
is
consistently
implacably
and
in
some
cases,
systematically
anti-semitic.
sometimes
deliberately,
i
am
sorry
to
say.
and
dr.
grayzel
pointed
out
that
that
money
was
cross-examined
inadvertently
about
the
story
of
the
good
samaritan
which
would
appear
to
everyone,
perhaps
to
be
a
very
nice
story.
and
he
pointed
out
that
deliberate
anti-semitic
bias
of
that
story
and
how
historically
the
story
had
some
origin
and
jewish
roots,
but
that
the
samaritan
have
been
substituted
for
the
israelite,
it
originally
being
a
story
of
the
three
great
nations
of
jewish
society
and
their
varying
responsibilities
in
terms
of
the
laws
regarding
cleanliness
and
disease.
and
surely,
that
ought
to
be
enough
of
it.
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
of
course
he
was
the
school
district's
witness
and
i
did
disagree
with
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
i'll
accept
everything
he
said
on
cross
examination.
he
then
said
later,
mr.
justice
white
that,
well,
he
really
would
say
it
was
nonsectarian
within
the
protestant
sects.
well,
first
he
said
within
christianity
and
they
gave
a
great
caveat
as
to
the
catholics.
quite
a
caveat,
he
said
“well
i'm
not
a
catholic
and
i'm
not
qualified
to
say”
and
they
have
footnotes
and
transcriptions.
and
then
so
we
came
down
to
the
protestant
sects
and
then
he
finally
agreed
that
at
least
some
people
thought
it
was
the
new
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
--
revised
standard
version
was
highly
sectarian
that
there'd
been
a
public
burning
of
that
as
late
at
1952.
i
don't
think
he
came
out
with
anything
more
finally
than
it
was
nonsectarian
among
the
protestant
sects
and
that's
what
the
lower
court
found.
and
he
also
said
that
as
literature
and
as
history,
the
work
was
secondary
and
that
he
primary
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
i
think
that
later
on,
your
honor,
he
--
he
had
a
caveat
as
to
the
catholic
in
the
record.
on
direct
examination,
i
think,
he
said
that.
but
let's
assume,
your
honor,
that
it's
totally
nonsectarian
within
the
christian
church,
and
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
from
our
evidence
that
that
just
isn't
so
that
the
catholic
and
sect
goes
which
we
quote,
“they
very
--
the
catholic
encyclopedia
make
it
very
clear
that
the
catholics
regard
the
king
james
version,
which
had
been
characterized
as
the
chief
arm
of
the
protestant
revoked
through
his
dedication
is
profoundly
anti-catholic,
speaking
of
the
pope
as
that
man
of
sin.
and
the
catholics
characterized
it
as
a
work
full
of
error,
and
a
work
which
has
deliberately
been
used
for
proselytizing.
now,
whether
that's
true
or
not,
makes
no
difference
if
catholics
or
some
catholics
still
believe
and
it's
no
accident,
i
believe,
that
all
of
the
bible
reading
cases,
and
i
think
there's
no
exception
to
this,
they
were
brought
during
that
early
period.
the
1890s
and
1900
were
brought
by
catholics
and
in
fact,
the
most
shameful
page
in
philadelphia's
religious
history
throughout
of
this
controversy
were
a
few
blocks
from
the
place
where
this
case
was
tried,
in
the
infamous
nativist
riots
in
1844
brought
about
by
the
native
american
party
who
drew
out
of
what
version
of
the
bible
should
be
read
in
the
public
schools.
bishop
kendrick
had
said
that
do
a
version
ought
to
be
given
equal
status
and
the
no
nothing
seized
upon
that
and
said
“the
catholics
are
trying
to
throw
the
protestant
bible
out
of
the
public
schools.”
the
riots
followed
and
people
were
killed,
churches
were
burned.
in
fact,
the
catholics
finally
were
given
shelter
in
a
quaker
meeting-house
at
(inaudible).
and
this
is
not
a
typical
page
in
philadelphia's
religious
history,
we
pride
ourselves
on
religious
tolerance
but
that
happened
in
philadelphia,
and
concerned
this
very
thing
and
here,
whether
it
would
be
the
douay
version
or
the
king
james
version
that
should
be
read
upon
establishment.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no
sir,
because
i
find
it,
in
the
first
place,
it
is
not
common
to
all
of
the
bibles
in
this
sense.
there
are
books
that
are
omitted
from
the
douay
version
and
books
that
are
omitted
in
king
james.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
no
sir.
and
it
wouldn't
even
on
this
type
of
establishment
of
course
when
they
were
but
even
on
the
question
of
sectarian
practice
in
preferring
one
religion
over
another.
dr.
grayzel
testified
that
the
old
testament
was
--
was
warded
through
with
christological
references
as
he
put
it.
in
other
words,
they're
going
back
in
translation,
and
inserted
references
in
things
like
isaiah
in
such
a
form
as
to
predict
the
coming
of
christ
which
he,
as
a
jewish
scholar,
took
strong
exception
to
both
from
the
standpoint
of
religion
and
scholarship.
and
secondly,
you'd
have
the
problem
of
bible
reading
as
such.
you
see,
you
have
the
problem
that
some
sects
don't
believe
that
you
should
just
read
the
bible.
as
dr.
grayzel
says
in
judaism,
“you
don't
read
the
bible,
you
study
it.”
and
the
catholics
are
quite
clear
that
the
bible
should
be
pervade
to
the
members
of
the
catholic
church
by
the
church
and
with
its
explanation
and
with
its
--
and
under
its
authority.
so
i
think
you
have
that
problem
even
with
the
reading
of
the
old
testament
and
of
course
you'd
still
have
the
establishment
problem.
and
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i'm
sorry
to
say
i
have
not,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
do
not
know
if
they
do
it.
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh
indeed,
sir.
one
of
this
is
one
of
the
martin
luther's
quarrels
and
the
printing
of
the
bible
in
the
vernacular,
i
had
in
summary
or
hastily
i
understand
on
the
conclusion
of
the
course
but
i
understand
that
it's
quite
true.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
that
as
far
as
proselytizing
is
concerned,
that
this
book
had
shown
an
immense
power
to
proselyte
the
either
version,
to
proselytize
in
2000
years.
and
i
don't
--
i
don't
deplore
this
but
i
think
we
should
recognize
it
as
a
reality,
and
i
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
think
they
are
doing
it
for
another
reason.
yes,
sir.
and
i
might
say
here
that
to
--
thus
speaking
of
engle
or
speaking
of
these
other
line
of
cases,
the
focused
attention
on
what
the
children
do
or
do
not
do
is
irrelevant
to
the
establishment
clause.
it
may
be
relevant
as
to
the
free
exercise
clause
but
it's
irrelevant,
it's
what
the
state
does
and
in
that
respect,
you
cannot
distinguish
engle
and
vitale
unless
you
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
not
a
bit,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
it
means
action.
and
the
question
must
be
then
whether
in
fact
it
concerns
and
respects
religion
and
we
have
that
question
and
that's
argued
here
because
they
say
it
concerns
morality.
and
then
perhaps
whether
it's
de
minimis
but
it
makes
no
difference.
if
you
had
a
--
suppose
you
had
an
actual
established
church,
but
you
wouldn't
have
any
of
the
lesser
violations
just
because
people
didn't
have
to
go
to
it,
or
didn't
have
to
have
their
taxes
devoted
to
it.
in
fact,
that
gentleman
that
came
up
yesterday
who
moved
into
a
community
of
where
the
methodist
had
established
a
church
and
you've
asked
whether
there'd
be
any
detriment
to
him,
i
don't
think
there
needs
to
be
any
detriment.
i
think
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
live
in
a
society
that
doesn't
have
an
established
church.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
his
standing
i
think
would
be
just
that.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
think
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
--
that
he
would
have
standing.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well
i
--
i
think
he
would
have
standing
because
i
think
that
he
has
--
he
has
a
--
the
constitution
gives
him
standing
because
it
gives
him
a
right.
and
the
right
that
it
gives
him,
i
submit
to
your
honor,
is
the
right
not
to
live
in
a
society
which
has
an
established
church,
whether
or
not
he
can
demonstrate
that
that
establishment
is
a
detriment
in
some
measurable
way
through
him.
it
is
a
detriment
to
his
rights
as
a
--
as
an
american
under
the
constitution.
now,
that
doesn't
mean,
your
honor,
that
a
dwindling
modicum
of
establishment
stand
at
the
point
of
the
rubric
on
the
coin
which
if
it's
anything
is
an
establishment,
i
think,
necessarily
always
--
there
isn't
also
a
dwindling
amount
of
standing.
and
i
think
when
you
get
to
that
point,
then
that
standing
is
so
miniscule,
the
incursion
is
so
slight,
the
amount
of
the
establishment
is
so
slight
that
the
court
dismisses
it
as
de
minimis.
and
probably,
i
would
suspect
on
the
basis
of
standing.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh
yes
sir,
i
--
i
have
discussed
that
in
this
sense.
as
an
establishment
de
minimis?
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir.
i've
discussed
it
in
the
sense
that
here
you
have
and
we
say
you
have
a
measurable
--
a
religious
ceremony
which
is
--
which
is
of
measurable
quantum
and
which
has
some
reasonable
impingement
upon
the
individual
that
secondly
the
state
is
doing
more
than
altering
the
little
counters
that
step
out
of
coin.
and
there's
necessarily
some
mechanism
behind
this
as
first
to
purchase,
distribution
of
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible
throughout
the
school
system.
there
then
the
rules
and
regulations
that
i
quoted.
there's
then
the
time
set
aside.
there
is
the
mechanism
for
excusing
but
this
is
sufficient
participation
--
active
participation
by
the
state,
when
it's
combined
with
the
fact
the
ceremony
is
so
clearly
religious,
to
take
it
out
of
the
de
minimis
clause
whereas
the
uttering
of
the
single
word
or
the
two
words
under
god
is
certainly
--
certainly
much
more
borderline
and
probably
de
minimis.
i
would
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
again
just
a
little
bit
to
the
situation
in
virginia.
and
the
reason
i
do
so
is
because
i
think
there's
no
clause
of
the
first
amendment
that
his
authorship
is
so
obvious
and
the
background
is
so
obvious,
and
the
situation
matches
are
so
closely.
both
of
these
laws
thought
there
was
very
much
the
same
objectives
as
specifically
expressed
in
the
preamble
of
the
bill
there
and
the
bill
in
pennsylvania
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
but
your
honor,
i
have
--
i
have
not
read
that
article
and
i
hope
that
isn't
true,
not
just
because
of
this
case
but
because
i
have
always
assumed
that
so
long
that
the
james
madison
leave
--
i'd
even
understood
that
justice
rutledge
in
everson
in
that
tremendous
dissent
of
his
in
the
everson
case
where
he
reviewed
all
of
the
circumstances
of
that
bill
at
assessment
flight
had
indicated
and
i
thought
that
he'd
said
that
we
even
had
grasp
of
earlier
versions
in
madison's
handwriting.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
think
you
did,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well
i
--
i
have
been
disturbed
by
it
too,
although
i
haven't
read
it
but
i
shall.
but
you
see
it
seem
to
me
madison
saw
the
problem
so
clearly
there,
and
it
seems
to
me
it
highlights
the
problem
and
i'm
speaking
now
just
the
establishment
clause
right
now.
because
i
think
we
have
just
the
perfect
and
typical
establishment
here
in
so
many
ways,
lesser
one
in
extent.
but
what
did
madison
see
wrong
with
this
assessment
bill
after
it
had
its
excused
provision?
it
assumed
both
sides
of
the
coin.
of
course
first
of
all
he
said,
“this
is
using
religion
as
an
engine
of
civil
policy.
and
there
is
to
obtain
very
worthy
civil
objectives,
you
will
use
religion
as
your
instrumentality.”
and
we
heard
that
argument
developed
that
at
length
here
yesterday.
and
mr.
burch
i
think
fell
in
the
exact
same
error
as
patrick
henry,
when
he
supported
this
bill
later
on
when
he
became
governor.
and
that
is
--
this
is
a
good
thing
for
people
and
you're
going
to
use
this
particular
way
in
order
to,
so
to
speak,
establish
either
tranquility
in
society
or
tranquility
in
the
classroom.
and
after
all,
if
it's
good
for
school
children,
why
isn't
it
good
for
the
general
public?
why
not
have
the
city
council
of
philadelphia
pass
an
ordinance
saying
that
the
mayor
will
going
to
read
ten
verses
of
the
bible
on
every
radio
station
every
morning
at
a
certain
hour,
to
open
the
day
if
it
sets
the
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
i
don't
sir.
i'm
glad
it
isn't
tranquil.
and
i
shouldn't
perhaps
have
used
that
word
because
i'm
not
sure
it
was
the
word
of
counsel
but
perhaps
one
of
the
members
of
the
bench.
he
did
speak
of
authority
and
discipline
and
they
kind
of
settled
them
down.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir,
and
i
think
that
if
it
settles
down
children,
why
the
schools?
why
the
schools?
it's
always
the
schools.
why
shouldn't
--
if
it's
good
for
school
children,
it's
good
for
everybody
and
in
fact
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
now,
if
he
wanted
to
do
it,
it
wouldn't
be
but
i
said
if
the
city
counsel
past
the
statute
saying
he
should
do
it.
and
that
which
should
be
ready
and
that
the
radio
stations
are
giving
the
time,
and
you'd
have
the
less
of
the
captive
audience
than
you
have
in
school.
yes,
i
think
that
would
be
an
establishment.
i
don't
think
he
could
do
it.
as
a
mandated
thing
by
the
legislature,
i
think
not.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
if
he
pays
for
the
time.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh
yes
sir,
sure.
but
i'm
proposing
a
different
problem.of
course,
he
could.
i
have
no
reservation
about
that
at
all.
he
can
do
it
on
television
if
he
can
pay
for
the
time
or
he
can
go
in
the
street
corner
and
he's
got
an
absolute
constitutional
right.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir,
i
think
there
is
potential
conflict
in
those
two
concepts.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
could
--
if
i
may
give
you
an
example,
the
most
typical
one
that
comes
to
my
mind
is
the
question
of
chaplains
in
the
armed
forces.
that
case
if
it
ever
comes,
i
think,
will
bring
into
square
conflict,
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
clause
because
it
is
certainly
much
of
an
establishment.
you
could
hardly
say
that
was
“de
minimis”.
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
state,
by
its
own
coercive
legal
power,
physically
separates
a
man
from
his
religious
activity,
his
religious
sources,
then
you
have
also
gravely
damaged
his
free
exercise,
unless
you
provide
him
with
an
alternative.
and
i
don't
propose
to
settle
that
question
here.
i
would
find
it
more
comfortable
to
argue
that
the
free
exercise
clause
there
prevails
over
establishing.
that's
one
instance
when
i
think
they
come
into
direct
conflict.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
the
other
instance,
the
other
kind
of
instance
that
it
would
seem
to
me
would
be
the
taxation
situation.
there,
you
see
taking
the
famous
tax
to
power,
and
the
tax
is
the
power
to
destroy,
taxation
being
an
affirmative
exception
by
the
state,
you
may
have
a
free
exercise
conflict
against
an
establishment
conflict.
and
i
think
there
are
two
instances
which
kind
of
--
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
conflict
here.
and
if
justice
stewart
sees
one,
i
do
not
think
there
is
one
in
this
case.
i
think
they
can
come
into
conflict.
and
on
that
note,
let
me
discuss
barnette,
if
i
may,
because
i
think
barnette
has
been
--
has
not
been
cited
properly
here.
i
understand
barnette
to
be
a
situation
in
which
the
jehovah's
witnesses
are
not
complaining
about
professions
of
belief
and
disbelief
but
about
the
idea
that
to
raise
your
hand
towards
the
flag
was
violation
of
the
(voice
overlap).
but,
i
submit
that
the
flag
salute
and
particularly
then
before
it
had
the
‘54
clause
in
an
under
god.
the
act
of
saluting
the
flag
is
a
secular
act
to
everyone
except
to
jehovah's
witness
or
maybe
some
other
few
sects.
but
it's
a
secular
act,
and
that's
the
reason
that
court
there
stops
short
of
prohibiting
the
activity.
they
simply
because
it's
enough
there
if
you
simply
say
you,
if
your
religion
thinks
of
it
as
a
religious
act,
you
don't
have
to
participate.
but
it
being
to
everyone
else
a
secular
activity,
then
you
have
no
standing
or
did
they
ask
by
the
way
and
that's
another
point,
they
didn't
ask
for
it
and
then
the
doctrine
of
judicial
parsimony
why
should
you
do
it.
but
even
if
they
had,
you
have
no
right
to
stop
a
secular
act
just
like
the
conscientious
objector
situation;
you
make
a
special
exception
when
the
religious
basis,
the
war
goes
on.
that
is
the
difference,
it
seems
to
me,
and
torcaso
by
the
way
have
somewhat
the
same
situation.
in
the
first
place,
in
torcaso's
case,
he
just
asked
for
a
writ
of
mandamus
and
that's
where
we
start
and
that's
what
the
court
gave
him.
and
i
don't
think
you
were
asked
to
do
any
more
than
that.
he
says,”
i
want
the
office.”
and
he
bought,
he
didn't
asked
for
injunction
against
the
oath
the
way
we
did
or
anything
about,
he
just
said,
“i
want
the
office”
and
he
used
the
appropriate
writ
for
it
and
he
granted
the
writ.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
torcaso?
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes.
i
think
it's
a
free
exercise
case.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
most
definitely.
but
i'm
just
distinguishing
why
you
don't
take
the
whole
ceremony
out,
because
it's
a
secular
ceremony
and
not
a
religious
one.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
i
applied
the
same
rule
as
--
as
chaplain
and
the
armed
forces
of
the
prisons.
i
mean,
unless
you
learn
--
you
can't
very
well
say
well
they're
being
punished
because
then
you'd
be
saying,
well,
they're
being
punished
in
part
of
the
person's
denial,
he
wouldn't
that.
so
i
think
they're
in
the
same
category
really
as
the
people
in
the
armed
forces
where
the
state
has
physically
removed
them
from
their
religious
sources.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
chaplains,
yes
sir
i
would
--
i
would.
i
was
saying
that
it
seems
to
me
that
the
vice
that
madison
saw
in
the
assessment
bill
of
using
religion
as
an
engine
of
civil
policy
applied
here
and
i've
cited
some
of
the
arguments
were
made
yesterday.
i'm
asking
solely
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin
and
i
think
we
have
that
here
and
that
is
that
there's
a
kind
of
a
bargain
strike
because
what
does
religion
get
out
of
the
--
out
of
the
arrangement,
i
don't
suggest
anything
venal
but
this
arrangement
is
typical
of
an
establishment.
it
gets
the
state's
ejus
in
providing
the
measure
--
the
audience.
now,
we're
talking
establishment
now
aside
from
the
excuse
what
the
state
provides
the
audience.
and
i
suggest
that
this
kind
of
double
accommodation
that
it
typifies
establishment
everywhere
that
it
exists.
and
i
think
that
--
that
was
in
the
assessment
bill
and
i
think
it's
here.
in
other
words,
the
state
lands
it's
ejus
to
in
some
way,
in
some
way
putting
an
official
sanction
or
in
some
way
accommodating
or
aiding
the
religion
or
a
group
of
religions.
and
in
exchange,
the
religion
is
supposed
to
fulfill
a
civil
end
of
the
state.
and
there
are
--
have
been
certainly
in
history,
examples
where
that
went
terribly
far
indeed
where
the
religion
was
part
of
the
repressive
engine
of
the
state
and
by
the
same
as
token,
the
religion
was
quite
a
state-aided
it
in
its
preeminent
position.
we
don't
suggest
that
but
i
say
it's
a
whole
market
of
establishment
and
i
think
that
this
bill
is
an
example
of
it
and
i
think
the
legislature
so
intended
here
to
use
religion
as
an
engine
of
civil
policy
for
very
worthy
causes.
but
i
think
in
violation
of
the
constitution
nonetheless
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
think
it
was
murdock
versus
pennsylvania,
your
honor
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
cantwell
versus
connecticut
but
murdock
versus
pennsylvania
but
i'm
a
little
bit
unsure
about
that,
it's
either
one
of
the
other
of
the
two.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
where
this
kind
of
clause
is
involved.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
think
that's
respectable
as
to
option
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
would
say
--
(voice
overlap)
in
which
that
was
involved.
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
there
was
--
you
mean
a
louisiana
school
book
case
before
everson?
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
the
purchase
of
school
books
for
parochial
school
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir,
i
just
had
the
impression
that
was
after
everson,
but
i'm
--
i'm
sure
i
stand
corrected.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
it
is
a
relatively
recent
doctrine
indeed,
sir.
i
don't
fall
over
that.
i
think
it's
rather
firmly
embedded
now
in
a
number
of
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
you've
got
everson,
you've
got
mccollum,
you've
got
zorach
and
then
you
have
barnette
in
the
sense
now.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh
just
on
establishment.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
so
as
torcaso
and
now
you
have
engle.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
think
that'd
be
it.
now,
we
think
of
course
in
mccollum
controls,
too.
if
engle
it
seems
to
me
just
clearly
controls
from
the
standpoint
of
establishment,
i
just
don't
think
there'd
any
question
you
could
possibly,
you
have
to
reexamine
engle.
it's
what
the
state
is
doing
as
i
say,
the
acts
of
participation
mean
nothing
in
terms
of
establishment.
but
we
think
mccollum
controls
and
so
that
the
--
so
did
the
lower
court
and
chief
judge
biggs'
opinion,
he
so
states.
and
i
should
think
you
have
too
because
in
mccollum,
you
really
had
a
couple
of
preachers
that
were
really
less,
less
of
an
establishment
in
one
respect
and
certainly
less
in
the
free
exercise.
and
now
i'm
on
both
clauses
because
i'm
just
saying
the
case
controls.
after
all
in
mccollum,
at
least
that
the
religious
material
was
pervade
by
private
instructors
and
not
by
the
authority
of
the
teacher
and
in
the
sense
that's
less
of
an
establishment.
and
then
under
the
free
exercise
clause,
two
differences
are
that
in
mccollum
and
this
is
important
i
think
under
free
exercise,
you
had
to
volunteer
to
get
the
instruction
which
is
certainly
a
lot
less,
i
would
think,
a
lot
less
of
a
violation
than
to
have
to
volunteer
out,
so
to
speak,
and
decide
not
to
have
it.
and
the
other
would
be
that
you
--
at
least
got
your
own
religion
if
you
volunteered
and
you
didn't
get
anybody
else's.
and
that
the
lower
court
thought
mccollum
because
they
decided
this
case
of
course
before
they
had
the
benefit
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
engle
case.
well,
we
say
that
there
is
an
establishment.
in
addition
to
that
it
is
clear
as
crystal
and
just
ingenuous
to
say
that
this
doesn't
prefer
one
religion
over
another.
and
how
fine
you
chop
it
is
another
thing.
but
certainly
at
the
grossest
of
the
broadest
than
any
sense
of
the
word
it
prefers
christian
religions
over
non-christian
religions.
i
think
it
goes
further
than
that
and
that
you
cannot
do
and
that
statute
does.
it
is
a
religious
exercise.
it
seems
to
me,
it
was
intended
to
be
a
religious
exercise.
i
think
it's
ingenuous
to
suggest
that
the
legislature
had
anything
else
in
mind
but
that.
i
don't
think
that
you
can
use
the
word
morality
to
encompass
all
of
these
pervade
to
the
minds
of
children
by
this
book.
and
there
will
be
many,
many
things
read
out
of
the
king
james
version
will
rule
exclusively
--
if
you
can
separate
the
challenge
but
it
will
exclusively
concern
religious
concepts
and
ideas
without
any
distinguishable
moral
truth.
certainly,
citations
could
be
multiplied
endlessly
in
terms
of
ritual,
in
terms
of
many
kinds
of
beliefs
that
are
religious
in
nature
and
haven't
any
but
of
most
minor
degree
of
morality.
and
if
you're
teaching
morality
again,
you
would
hardly
provide
for
excuses
that
pointed
out,
and
secondly,
why
would
you
have
no
comment,
every
other
subject
the
secular
subject
is
taught,
is
taught
with
comment,
why
not
this
one?
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
oh,
your
honor,
that's
just
simply
saying
that
if
--
if
the
legislature
for
pennsylvania
has
traditionally
had
an
act
that
violates
the
first
amendment,
then
it's
entitled
to
continue
now.
their
argument
goes
a
little
further
than
that
because
it
says
that
the
duty
of
government
and
they
use
the
word
government
as
a
whole,
presumably
to
include
the
judiciary
and
then
in
the
sense,
of
course
it
does.
the
duty
of
government
is
to
be
neutral
about
these
matters
and
if
you
decide
to
take
this
practice
all
out
since
it
is
traditional,
that
is
being
unneutral.
well,
that
just
seems
to
me
to
relegate
the
role
of
the
judiciary.
i
don't
know
what
the
function
would
be
as
to
anything
that
wasn't
noble.
and
the
fact
that
it's
old
has
it
seems
to
me
nothing
to
do
with
being
neutral
or
unneutral.
we're
complaining
that
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
has
been
unneutral
and
under
the
system
we
have,
i
think
we've
come
to
the
judiciary
to
set
the
matter
straight
if
they're
minded
to
agree
with
us.
and
this
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
unneutral
just
because
in
addition
to
those
facts,
the
unneutrality
in
our
view,
it
is
the
unneutrality
happens
to
go
back
quite
a
while.
i
think
the
tradition
is
not
to
be
stuck
up
but
let
me
say
this
very
candidly.
i
think
it
is
the
final
arrogance
to
talk
constantly
about
our
religious
tradition
in
this
country
and
acquaint
it
with
this
bible.
sure,
religious
tradition,
whose
religious
tradition?
it
isn't
any
part
of
the
religious
tradition
of
substantial
number
of
americans
of
a
great
many
--
a
great
many
things
and
really
some
of
the
salient
features
of
the
king
james
version
or
the
douay
version
to
that
matter.
and
it
is
just
to
me
a
little
bit
easy
and
i
say
arrogant
to
keep
talking
about
our
religious
tradition.
it
suggests
that
the
public
schools
at
least
to
pennsylvania
or
a
kind
of
protestant
institutions
to
which
others
are
cordially
invited.
and
i
think
to
some
extent
they
have
been
in
our
state
and
nobody
and
maybe
in
times
gone
by,
that
didn't
make
very
much
difference
or
that
those
that
we're
injured
were
no
perhaps
legal
because
of
the
newness
of
this
doctrine,
your
honor,
or
psychological
or
even
financial
position
to
complain
much
about
it.
but
we
have
here
in
the
schools
of
pennsylvania,
the
conducting
mandated
by
statute
day
after
day
as
an
exercise,
the
reading
of
the
sacred
book
of
christianity.
and
i
submit
to
you
gentlemen
that
that
is
as
the
lower
court
found
as
a
fact,
finding
of
fact
conducted
there
as
a
religious
ceremony.
i
might
say
the
footnote
of
that
that
the
lower
court
found
as
a
fact
that
there
was
a
higher
demeanor
and
standard
of
the
court
that
required
that
during
this
time.
now,
that
isn't
a
bad
thing
if
you're
going
to
read
the
bible
honorably
but
it's
certainly
demonstrates
again,
if
it's
higher
than
other
secular
subjects,
it
is
regarded
differently
and
can
only
be
regarded,
i
think,
as
a
religious
ceremony.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
on
the
second
opinion,
your
honor
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
yes
sir,
they
did
on
the
second
opinion.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
there's
nothing.
i
submit
that
the
circumstances
are
at
record
and
you
can
judge.
it's
not
disagreed
upon
that
bible
reading,
prayer,
spread
of
religions,
school
announcements
follow
seriatim.
without
any
more
than
a
decent
clause
and
i
suggest
that
--
i
just
can't
see
the
practical
matter
and
this
is
what
mr.
schempp
said.
how
could
you
excuse
the
child
from
one
and
not
the
other?
unless
he
stands
immediately
outside
the
classroom
door,
which
happens
to
be
typical
of
punishment,
but
that's
incidental
perhaps
but
he
stands
immediately
outside
and
when
he
hears
the
class
finish
the
recitation
of
the
end
of
the
lord's
prayer
and
he
hears
the
almanac,
comes
first
and
back
in
again.
now,
whether
that
would
be
done
that
way,
or
some
other
way,
well,
i
just
submit
as
a
matter
of
logic.
he
either
misses
the
pledge
of
allegiance
which
greater
even
more
greatly
as
mr.
schempp
testify
would
compound
the
confusion
as
to
what
he
dissents
from
and
there's
enough
equation
now,
it
seems
to
me,
or
possible
when
mr.
schempp
reasonably
apprehended
i
think
between
some
time
religious
dissent
perhaps
and
then
you
go
to
atheism
that
maybe
equated
with
un-americanism
and
if
you're
missing
the
flag
salute
and
in
any
way,
then
misses
the
school
announcements.
it's
a
price
you
shouldn't
have
to
pay.
why
should
he
miss
the
school
--?
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
no,
i'm
arguing
that
the
inference
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
we
have
to.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
none
whatsoever,
(voice
overlap)
sir.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
believe
it
can,
your
honor.
i
think
the
courts
have
done
it
before,
i
think
justice
frankfurter
did
it
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
mccollum.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
it
wasn't
the
court
doing,
but
i,
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
can
always
recognize
the
facts
of
life
and
judicial
notice
of
the
--
as
justice
frankfurter
said
that
children
are
not
known
for
their
capacity
or
their
willingness
to
dissent.
i
think
that
we
just
know
this.
it's
a
thing
in
life.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
there
might
be
some
who
are
walking
50
miles
to
avoid
it.
i'm
just
saying,
if
i
may,
sir
in
closing,
that
we
rest
our
case
most
strongly
on
the
establishment
clause.
we
ask,
as
far
as
the
schempps
are
concerned,
for
nothing
more
than
what
i
think
we
would
suppose
them
to
be
entitled
to
and
that
is
they
do
not
in
complying
with
the
state's
compulsory
school
attendance
law
and
sending
their
children
there
that
they
don't
have
to
at
home
and
in
the
church
contradicts
what
is
taught
or
pervaded
the
children
in
the
schools.
that
seems
to
me
would
be
their
inherent
right
and
that
they
don't
have
to
pay
any
price,
any
price
at
all
no
matter
how
slight
to
avoid
that.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
both
and
here,
both
have
sued.
i
think
the
mccollum
case
established
completely,
there
only
vashti
mccollum,
the
mother
brought
the
suit,
not
the
child.
interestingly
enough
your
honor,
the
record
in
the
trial
of
that
case,
seems
to
indicate,
it
assembles
situation
but
as
i
read
it,
seems
to
indicate
that
one
of
the
troubles
was
that,
mrs.
vashti
mccollum
was
an
atheist
and
she
was
concerned
because
the
young
mccollum
was
becoming
rather
interested
in
going
to
this
release
time
ceremonies
in
the
school.
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
well,
to
do
it,
oh
he
brought
her
suit
--
mr.
henry
w.
sawyer,
iii
i
don't
think
if
there's
any
doubt
and
he
might
be
entertained
as
a
litigant
but
he
wasn't.
and
the
court
there
i
think
recognized
that
the
child
has
a
right
and
the
parent
has
a
right,
both
as
guardian
of
the
child
and
in
the
parent's
own
right.
so
i
think
the
right,
in
other
words,
to
answer
your
question
is
dual.
but
you
know
that
mccollum
situation
suggest
another
problem
here.
this
might
create
divisiveness
within
a
single
family
as
we
had
in
instance
even
mentioned
here
yesterday
and
mccollum
case
apparently
was
that,
although
i
don't
think
it's
in
the
opinion
itself.
thank
you,
your
honor.
