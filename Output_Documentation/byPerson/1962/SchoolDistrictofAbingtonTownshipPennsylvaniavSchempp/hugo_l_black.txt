say,

justice

well,
if
that's
right,
as
applied
to
this

why
only

5

if
the

it
for

why
not

i
ask
if

justice

black
this
--
if
it
depend
on
the
majority
of
the
people
in
the
school
district,
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
the
religious
doctrine
that
would
be
taught
would
naturally
follow
the
majority
in
their
district?
and
there
are
so
many
different
sects
in
this
country
that
you
would
have
different
public
schools
teaching
different
religions
in
--
everyone
and
then
these
people
who
are
so
anxious
to
have
this
particular
one
taught
would
probably
not
be
so
anxious
to
have
the
other
one
taught.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
and
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'll
call
your
attention
to
this
fact.
for
many
years,
we've
had
a
fight
on
this
country
to
have
more
time
for
working
men
to
all
get
off
from
work.
and,
it
so
happens
that
this
seventh
day
had
been
the
one
where
they've
gotten
off
from
work
and
they
have
it,
as
been
established
in
this
country
because
i
took
note
in
several
pieces
of
legislature
now
often,
that
its
thought
to
be
good
that
there'd
be
holidays
and
the
mere
fact
that
at
one
time,
people
thought
the
seventh
day
was
the
only
day
you
could
have
a
holiday,
would
it
be
--
wouldn't
make
it
any
different
if
you
provided
that
that
holiday
should
be
on
tuesday
or
wednesday.
that
might
conflict
with
somebody
else,
but
the
basis
of
those
opinions,
at
least
my
view
point,
was
very
simple,
with
the
power
to
protect
people
from
being
employed
two
long
hours
in
one
day
or
two
many
days
in
one
week.
it's
a
well
recognized
power
and
it
could
--
there
could
be
one
written
up
in
such
way.
it
said
we're
going
to
have
it
on
the
seventh
day
and
we're
going
to
have
it
from
--
holiday
from
10:00
until
12
o'clock
to
let
people
go
to
a
certain
church,
why
you'd
have
a
different
question.
but
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
your
argument
here
does
--
my
position
in
mcgowan
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
justice
hugo
l.

are
you
disavowing

are
you
disavowing
for
the
state
of
maryland
that
which
i
had
understood
is
generally
acknowledged
from
everything
i've
read
about
it
and
all
the
communication
that
has
been
transmitted
about
it,
that
this
is
because
--
they
want
to
do
this
because
it
impresses
the
lord's
prayer.
many
of
us
have
repeated
very
often,
and
require
the
reading
of
the
bible.
are
you
disavowing
that
the
purpose
is
to
increase
their
interest
in
that
particular
religion?
justice

you

know

how
can
you
assert
seriously

argue

to
consider
seriously,
this
is
not
a
religious
ceremony
based
on
the
bible
and

with

thought

there
any

you

any
reason
if
you
could
have
40,
why
you
couldn't
have
6

justice

black
and
why
you
shouldn't
have
all
of
them
taken
from
the
sacred
books
of
one
religion
rather
than
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understood
you
were
invoking
the
consequences
as
to
what
might
happen
if
the
decision
remains
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.

if
you
could
have
it
in
the
opening
exercises,
why
can't
you
continue
to
have
it
during
the
whole
day?
why
can't
you
pick
out
all
your
religious
sacred
documents
from
one
particular
religion
or
one
particular
sect
of
one
religion?
justice

l.
black
i've
heard
that
before.
justice

i've
heard
that
a

(inaudible)
--
are
you
suggesting
--
justice

l.
black
you're
suggesting
in
effect,
are
you
not,
the
constitution
leaves
it
open
for
the
states
to
leave
it
to
local
options
in
each
local
community
as
to
which
particular
brand
of
religion,
which
kind
of
religion,
will
be
read
and
taught
in
the
school.
it's
kind
of
a
local
option.
if
the
majority
wants
one,
they
could
get
it.
the
others
can
walk
out.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
sounds
to
me
like
it
was
your
suggesting
a
local
option.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
think
about
its
chance
about
being
read
in
baltimore?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
think
about
the
chance
of
having
the
book
of
mormon
substituted
for
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible
in
baltimore?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that's
theoretically
possible?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
do
not
understand
the
other
gentlemen
to
say
that
they
shouldn't
mention
anything
about
religion.
i
understood
them
to
say
that
it
was
alright
to
teach
religion
as
a
subject.
their
objection
is
to
the
fact
that
you
pick
out,
i
may
say
two
things
which
i've
known
about
from
my
earliest
inferences,
which
i
could
agree
with
you
easily,
should
have
a
wonderful
effect
on
people
who
read
them
and
recite
them.
but,
other
people
don't
feel
that
way.
what
you
have
picked
out,
these
two
particular
things:
the
bible,
king
james
version,
and
the
lord's
prayer.
it's
one
can
hardly
mention
without
reverence,
at
least
i
believe
as
i
did.
you
picked
them
out
and
say
people
must,
into
this
school,
either
listen
to
them
and
participate
in
or
walk
out.
now,
why
can't
you
do
that
with
reference
to
the
mormons
if
they
want
to
where
they
are
the
majority,
or
any
other
by
those
people
in
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
local
option
in
determining
what
--
which
particular
religion
will
be
taught
in
each
particular
community.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
be
willing
to
say
if
the
state
should
go
further
in
that
instance
and
release
all
of
them
from
paying
any
part
of
taxes
that
went
into
support
of
the
school?
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
if
they
will
--
but
they
would
walk
out
that
they
didn't
want
that
part
at
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
be
release
from
taxes
to
carry
out
these
views
if
the
majority
wanted,
which
they
didn't
want?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they've
--
they
have
not
gone
there
through
choice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
not
gone
there
through
choice.
the
public
schools
were
open
to
your
children.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
were
open
to
your
children.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
see
that
we
have
much
personal
standing
here
but
i
do
not
quite
know
with
you
when
you
say
the
man
has
to
be
a
nonbeliever
in
order
to
have
standing.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
lord's
prayer
comes
from
the
sixth
chapter
of
matthew.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
are
many
people
who
devoutly
believe
admonition
in
that
chapter
that
they
should
not
pray
in
public.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
they
are
earnest,
devout,
god-fearing
christians.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
that
chapter,
three
verses
before
the
lord's
prayer
begins,
advises
not
to
pray
as
the
hypocrites
do
in
public.
go
into
your
closet.
there,
pray.
may
god
--
if
god
hears
you
in
secret,
will
answer
you
in
secret.
why
would
not
a
man
have
a
right?
i
found
that
this
is
a
very
strong
belief
throughout
the
country
in
the
last
year
that
these
people
should
not
be
made
to
pray
in
public
even
some
of
the
most
earnest
christians.
why
should
they
not
have
a
right
to
challenge
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
agree
that
with
abington
that
there
is
no
one
impression
on
a
little
child.
then
i
got
to
do
that
with
all
the
others
to
do
it
at
which
if
he
doesn't
do,
you
have
to
step
aside.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
cannot
--
can
you
assume
that
children
are
of
that
way?
can
you
assume
that
there
are
certain
differences?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
which
children
in
school
will
have
the
majority
and
overwhelming
majority
belong
to
one
group.
they've
got
to
step
aside
each
time
they
say
something.
can
you
assume
that
there'd
be
no
pressure
on
them
to
step
aside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
assume
that
we
can
distinguish
that
that
confers
a
little
different
than
your
idea
of
the
bible.
we
can
assume
the
bible
whenever
it's
read,
it's
not
read
to
call
its
religious
connotation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
we
adopted
--
do
you
think
we
adopted
it
because
of
its
morality
or
because
of
our
religious
faith?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
think
we've
had
to
do
that
if
we
had
that
kind
of
sentence
because
as
i
recall
it,
the
government
had
a
great
deal
to
do
it
by
force
in
compelling
people
to
belong
to
that
religion,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
know
whether
anyone
has
ever
suggested
that
they
have
to
pass
a
law
to
read
the
qur'an
in
school?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
reason?
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
that
the
reason
--
isn't
it
the
reason
that
the
bible
is
a
religious
book.
the
prayers
are
all
religious
prayers.
its
writings
have
been
accepted
through
the
centuries
as
the
great
fruits
of
religion.
isn't
that
here?
how
can
we
escape
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
everybody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
have
to
assume
that
pennsylvania
has
done
this
not
to
advance
religion
at
all,
not
because
the
people
have
their
belief
in
the
bible,
not
because
they
believe
in
the
religion
that
keeps
it,
but
wholly
aside
from
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
it
has
the
moral
precepts
which
it
does.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
assumption
we
have
to
make.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
--
suppose
the
statute
says
that
they
get
it
from
this,
suppose
the
statute
says,
“we
want
this
bible
reading
and
through
every
morning
because
we
are
religious
people.
we
believed
in
the
particular
religion
of
the
bible
and
we
want
it
read.”
so
that
it
will
keep
the
children
of
all
the
school
children
in
pennsylvania
can
hear
it.
although
we
will
excuse
those
who
do
not
want
to
but
we
do
it
because
it's
a
religious
book,
what
would
you
say
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
it
gets
down
to
a
question
of
whether
we
can
say
that
it
is
being
used
as
a
religious
book
and
that
we
could
say
because
it
is
a
religious
book
and
if
we
say
that,
would
we
hold
a
constitution?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
it
when
they
gathered
when
i
was
asking
you,
whether
the
people
of
pennsylvania
have
then,
whether
they
have
access
and
done
it
because
as
i
would
assume
about
your
argument,
that
people
then
believe
in
that
religion.
they
like
the
bible.
they've
heard
it
from
the
inferences.
they
loved
it.
they
loved
its
principles
and
they
want
to
have
it
taught
in
their
schools,
because
it's
a
religious
book.
well,
that's
your
argument.
i
would
not
have
thought
that
was
questioned.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you
would
agree,
wouldn't
you,
that
during
its
2000
years
of
history,
the
greatest
year,
the
most
voted
year
and
the
most
productive
year
of
the
christian
religion
have
been
those
years
when
government
didn't
enforce
it,
would
you
agree
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
then
its
worst
years
have
been
the
years
when
in
some
way
public
officials
that
hold
up
and
corrupted,
you
would
agree
with
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
do
you
mean
by
de
minimis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
violation
--
the
violation
of
the
amendment
is
so
little.
the
court
is
known
always
as
the
court.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
think
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
suppose
what
you're
saying
is
that
there's
no
part
of
the
first
amendment
is
applicable
to
the
state
that
gives
any
person
the
right
case,
call
on
the
state
to
open
up
a
place
for
him
to
practice
religion.
that
religion
is
at
least
religion
as
a
voluntary
thing
for
the
people
to
infer.
i
would
think
probably,
that's
what
you
think
the
idea
about
free
exercise.
justice
hugo
l.
black
throughout
the
ages,
politicians
have
wanted
to
get
hold
of
religion
and
they've
done
it
now
and
then
to
the
great
discomfiture
religion
in
the
final
analysis.
justice
hugo
l.
black
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
there
was
the
time
that
was
thought
to
be
a
sin
if
translated
by
a
woman
so
that
people
could
read
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
discussed
in
your
brief
this
problem
that
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
de
minimis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
do
you
happen
to
read
a
recent
article
of
the
washburn
law
college
journal
that
takes
the
position
that
madison
was
not
responsible
for
the
first
amendment
and
that,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
failed
to
get
his
amendments
through
and
that
the
changes
were
made
were
so
material,
that
they
took
away
the
idea
of
the
virginia
remote
instances.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
afraid
i
said
it
too.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
reason
i
have
to
stay
by
this
article.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
see
any
conflict
between
these
two
concepts,
one
that
the
state
shall
keep
its
hands
completely
off
religion
but
not
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
it's
left
for
the
people
who
voluntarily
choose
it.
and
the
other
provision
that
says
if
the
people
shall
have
that
right
freely
to
exercise
their
religion
whenever
they
desire?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
what
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
are
those?
