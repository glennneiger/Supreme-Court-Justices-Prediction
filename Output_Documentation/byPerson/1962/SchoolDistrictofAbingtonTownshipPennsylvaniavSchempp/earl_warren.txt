mr.
kerpelman.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
kerpelman,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well.
mr.
burch.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let
us
take
a
state
like
hawaii.
hawaii
has
a
large
percentage
of
people
of
japanese
origin,
large
percentage
of
people
with
chinese
origin.
and
in
many
places
in
the
islands,
there
will
be
a
vast
majority
of
either
chinese
or
japanese
in
their
public
schools.
do
you
--
do
you
say
that
in
schools
of
that
kind
it
would
be
proper
to
have
a
--
in
the
chinese
school
to
have
a
buddhist
ceremony
that
all
children,
including
christians,
must
conform
to
or
have
their
parents
disavow
it
or
the
shinto
religion,
so
far
as
your
family
is
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
answer
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
would
be
yes
then,
that
they
could
do
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
we
also
pointed
out
in
mcgowan,
didn't
we,
that
the
state
had
departed
so
far
from
religious
purposes
that
it
specifically
authorized
the
sale
of
liquor
and
the
keeping
open
of
a
dancing
salon
and
a
few
other
gambling
and
a
few
other
questionable
things,
and
didn't
we
point
out
in
there
that
that
was
evidence
of
having
been
a
real
departure
from
the
religious
purposes
that
went
back
into
the
ages?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
when
you
come
to
the
saying
that
it
had
a
basis
in
religion,
couldn't
we
say
the
same
thing
for
practically
all
of
our
basic
crimes?
are
they
not
--
do
they
not
stem
from
a
violation
of
the
ten
commandments?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
mcgowan
went
on
this
theory
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
that
there
was
such
a
departure
from
the
original
concept
that
they
were
in
that
category.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
there
any
departure
whatsoever
in
your
case
from
religious
purposes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
there
is,
i
wish
you'd
state
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
chief
justice
earl
warren
wouldn't
the
--
wouldn't
their
full
religious
ceremony
constitute
or
accomplish
the
same
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no,
just
to
promote
the
--
just
to
promote
the
welfare
of
the
students
and
to
put
them
in
a
proper
frame
of
mind
for
their
work
throughout
the
day.
wouldn't
a
full
religious
ceremony
accomplish
the
same
purpose?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
couldn't
it
be
justified
on
your
argument
just
as
well?
chief
justice
earl
warren
could
they
go
at
all
beyond
the
reading
of
the
lord's
prayer
and
reading
of
the
bible
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
as
a
matter
of
degree.
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
merely
paraphrasing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
merely
paraphrasing
and
enlarging
upon
the
letter
of
your
superintendent?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
understood
you
to
say
you
didn't
quarrel
with
vitale
that
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
believe
that's
perfectly
alright;
that
our
decision
was
alright.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
then
why
do
you
want
us
to
reexamine
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
alright,
but
i
understood
you
to
answer
mr.
justice
harlan
that
you
want
us
to
reexamine
these
cases
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
baker.
chief
justice
earl
warren
attorney
general
finan.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
we
have
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
theism
or
nontheism?
aren't
there
very
large
religious
groups
who
believe
is
fervently
in
a
god
as
those
who
composed
this
procedure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
were
opposed
to
this
case?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
god?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
a
basis
of
theism,
is
it
not?
aren't
there
people
who
were
opposed
to
this,
who
were
just
as
fervently
--
fervent
in
their
belief
in
god
as
are
those
who
prescribed
this
oath
and
who
yet
oppose
it?
why
do
we
have
to
make
it
an
issue
between
atheism
and
christianity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we
have
briefs
amicus
curiae
in
this
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
there's
a
brief
of
the
synagogue
council
of
america
and
national
community
relations
advisory
council
and
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
there
are
some
millions
of
people
of
that
faith
in
this
country
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
oppose
it
as
fervently
as
these
people
who
happen
to
be
atheist
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
so
why
do
we
have
to
put
it
in
that
context?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
by
reading
the
lord's
prayer
and
reading
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible,
we
put
the
christian
concept
of
theism
onto
it,
do
we
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
your
supreme
court
based
its
decision
on
that
ground?
chief
justice
earl
warren
in
other
words,
he
treated
the
merits
of
the
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general,
that
--
let's
take
a
very
practical
situation.
again,
in
hawaii,
where
there
are
a
great
many
buddhists.
let
us
say
there's
a
school
where
there
are
51
buddhist
children
and
49
christian
children
and
because
of
the
majority,
the
buddhist
children
is
determined
by
the
school
to
have
a
buddhist
ceremony
comparable
to
this
christian
ceremony
that
we
have
here.
would
you
think
because
they're
in
the
majority
that
the
49%
of
them
that
are
christians
in
that
school
would
have
to
walk
out?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
would
--
do
you
think
they
would
have
the
right
to
have
such
a
ceremony
as
a
matter
of
school
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren

school

appellants,
versus
edward

schempp,
et
al.hfa
mr.
ward,
you
may
continue
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
are
you
saying
--
are
you
saying,
mr.
ward,
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
contends
that
all
of
those
children
whose
parents
are
amoral
and
who
don't
want
their
children
to
be
product
in
moral
teaching
have
the
right
to
be
excused
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
from
--
from
--
from
that
training
which
you
were
giving
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
what
--
isn't
that
the
effect
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
fourth
--
the
fourth
category
of
course
would
be
parents
who
are
amoral.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
they
don't
want
their
children
raised
in
that
kind
of
an
atmosphere.
and
you
say
as
to
those,
it
is
important
as
the
state
of
pennsylvania
thinks
this
moral
training
is,
those
children
may
be
excused.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
they're
separate,
but
equal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ward,
are
you
asking
us
to
overrule
vitale?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
isn't
it
vitale?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
mean
there
is
no
religious
meaning
to
the
lord's
prayer?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it's
permitted
under
the
same
--
permitted
under
the
same
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
it's
done,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
suppose
they
read
them,
that
part
of
the
bible,
it
is
the
lord's
prayer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ward,
would
you
say
that
if
the
statute
did
require
the
children
to
repeat
the
lord's
prayer
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
think
it
would?
it
will
fall
--
fall
exactly
the
same
category
as
vitale?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
ward,
may
i
ask
you
this
please.
suppose
we
accept
your
argument
that
this
ceremony
is
moral
instruction
and
is
not
in
any
sense
religious.
and
supposed
the
state
next
says
following
the
ceremonies
each
morning
there
shall
be
one
hour
of
instruction
in
morals.
and
during
that
hour
of
instruction,
nothing
shall
be
done
except
to
read
the
bible
to
the
students
and
all
must
attend
except
those
whose
parents
object
to
it.
do
you
think
that
would
be
acceptable
also?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
would
an
hour
of
instruction
in
morals
beyond
constitutional
with
a
few
moments
of
instruction
would
not
be?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
it
is
very
important.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
that
our
problem
today?
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
have
one
final
statement,
you
may
make
it
if
you
do,
mr.
ward.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
have
used
your
hour
up.
if
it's
very
brief,
he
may
do
it
but
you
use
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
make
a
short
statement.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
i'll
give
you
five
minutes.

justice

warren
