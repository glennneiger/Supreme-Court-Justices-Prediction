no
allegation
that
no
one
has
permitted
him
to
be
excused.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
petition
alleges
that
after
a
complaint
was
made,
the
rule
was
amended
whereby
he
was
permitted
to
be
excused.
now,
a
--
to
say
that
we
are
compelled
without
any
facts
is
really
a
conclusion
of
law
particularly
when
you
have
already
set
forth
a
provision
in
the
rule
that
you
can
be
excused.
now,
if
there's
any
abusiveness,
if
there's
any
coercion
that
he
can't
be
excused,
then
i
would
certainly
think
that
that
would
be
true,
that
you
would
have
a
different
case
entirely
before
this
court.
