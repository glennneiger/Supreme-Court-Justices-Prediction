mr.
burch,
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
burch
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
i
thought
mr.
justice
harlan
when
he
started
out
his
question
to
you
on
the
premise
that
this
was
a
religious
exercise
and
if
you
start
out
on
that
premise,
(inaudible)
was
whether
or
not
they
didn't
require
a
reexamination
or
clarification.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
understand
you
to
say
if
you
start
with
that
premise,
(voice

--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
attorney
general,
as
i
read
the
complaint,
it
already
contains
an
allegation
that
the
rule
was
amended
so
as
to
release
him
from
participation
of
these
exercises.
and
if
that
--
that
allegation
that
he
nevertheless
says,
that
his
freedom
of
his
religion
has
been
restrained
and
that
is
the
allegation
which
was
admitted
by
the
demurrer,
even
right
in
the
face
of
his
own
allegation
that
he
had
been
released
from
the
exercises.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
makes
allegations
right
on
the
--
right
on
this
that
in
spite
of
his
being
released
from
the
exercises,
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
was
subjected
to
some
harm
and
these
allegations
were
admitted.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
thing.
do
you
really
see
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
the
--
as
far
as
it's
being
a
religious
exercise
or
not,
between
the
prayer
in
vitale
and
the
prayer
here,
regardless
of
its
source,
i
mean,
just
as
it's
a
kind
--
the
kind
of
an
occasion
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
assuming
that
it's
a
pray
--
that
it's
a
religious
item
and
you
say
--
i
gather,
you
join
with
baltimore
in
saying
that
it
wasn't
a
religious
exercise
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
it
wasn't
part
of
a
religious
exercise.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
is
it
as
much
of
a
religious
exercise
as
it
was
in
vitale?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
really
no
distinction
in
terms
of
the
kind
of
an
exercise
this
was
between
vitale
and
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
yes,
i
know
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
vitale
--
the
vitale
opinion
said,
“the
state
drafted
or
state
sanctioned,”
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
the
school
board's
rule
here
at
least
sanctioned
the
use
of
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
sanctioned
the
lord's
prayer.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
there'd
be
very
little
sense
of
excusing
anyone
from
the
prayer.
it
seems
to
me,
if
it
wasn't
--
if
somebody
didn't
have
a
feeling
that
it
was
a
sectarian
situation
or
there
would
be
a
very
little
reason
talking
about
the
king
james
version
of
the
bible
or
the
douay
version
of
the
lord's
prayer.
in
the
rule,
if
there
wasn't
some
feeling
that
it
was
giving
others
the
permission
to
use
the
douay
version
if
they
wanted
to.
it
seems
to
me
in
itself,
to
be
a
recognition
of
this
--
that
has
some
sectarian
aspects
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you
but
nevertheless,
in
the
school
board's
rule
which
was
promulgated,
people
were
given
permission
to
use
different
versions
of
the
bible.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you're
saying
--
what
you're
really
suggesting
is
that
the
only
people
who
should've
--
who
ever
should've
been
--
felt
any
urge
to
excuse
themselves
from
this
operation
would
be
atheists.
justice
byron
r.
white
schools
who
didn't
like
the
holy
bible.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
a
--
it's
noncompulsory,
was
there
any
place
in
the
school
with
the
--
i
can't
get
to
the
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
were
there
any
places
at
school
you'd
go
and
not
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
never
--
was
there
any
need
to
make
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
have
other
electives?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
ward,
i
take
it
then
you
do
say
that
--
that
one
of
the
differences
between
vitale
and
the
fact
the
students
here
do
not
in
this
case,
other
than
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
do
you
think
you
would
make
the
same
argument
as
the
--
that
the
school
required
into
--
to
teach
what
was
that
doing
in
that
unit?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
make
the
same
argument
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
ask
you,
do
these
students
repeat
after
the
reader
what
the
reader
read?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
it's
religious
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
make
them
a
vow
or
belief?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
is
--
assuming
that
engle
and
vitale
were
governed
to
take
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
going
on
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
going
on
with
(inaudible)
to
reexamine.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
assuming
--
assuming
that
the
court
found
it
to
be
a
levin
in
fact
that
the
case
of
vita
--
that
is
in
vitale,
are
you
going
on
to
say
that
we
should
reexamine
vitale?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
must
--
you
must
then
disagree
with
being
wide
goes
said
that
the,
what
did
you
say,
he
said,
“in
my
opinion,
the
bible
is
not
a
sectarian
book.”
justice
byron
r.
white
he's
also
a
dean
of
the
divinity
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
had
to
do
a
version
that
would
also
be
nonsectarian.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
read
it
very
well
that
one
i
might
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
--
do
you
say
that
to
find
the
--
find
that
the
state
has
made
a
law
respecting
an
establishment
that
that
state
need
not
to
act
in
coercive
way
at
all,
that
the
law
doesn't
mean
coercion.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
means
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many,
about
three
or
four?
