justice
william
o.
douglas
it
comes
down
to
the
doremus
case
from
new
jersey,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
your
argument
then
vary,
mr.
burch,
if
this
--
instead
of
the
bible,
it
was
the
koran
that
was
being
read
everyday
in
school?
justice
william
o.
douglas
then
the
big
contest
would
be
which
church
could
get
--
control
the
school
board,
i
suppose.
justice
william
o.
douglas
would
your
argument
be
the
same
if
a
quaker
pattern
was
followed
in
the
--
all
students'
request
to
remain
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
minutes
or
three
minutes?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes.
