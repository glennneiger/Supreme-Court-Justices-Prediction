justice

m.

there's
one
factor
in
this
case
that
was
present
in
engel
that
was
not
present
here.
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
state
itself
composed
this
prayer,
is
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course,
you've
got
the
record
down.
the
court
laid
great
emphasis
on
the
fact
that,
although
the
sunday
laws
had
their
origin
in
religion
and,
over
the
years,
they
had
departed
from
that
origin
and
had
taken
on
the
characteristic
of
simply
a
legislative
determination
that
a
day
of
rest
was
an
appropriate
thing
to
have
in
the
community.
and
therefore,
the
real
question
there
was
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
permissible,
given
that
transmutation
in
the
original
background
to
select
sunday
because
it
happened
to
coincide
with
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
it
would
be
helpful
if,
starting
from
the
premise,
that
this
is
a
religious
exercise.
you
could
enlighten
some
of
us
as
to
whether
you
think
this
case
can
be
distinguished
in
the
other
cases
in
this
field
that
the
court
has
decided
starting
with
everson,
mccollum,
zorach,
torcaso,
engel,
and
whether
if
you
think
that
they
--
it
cannot
be
whether
you're
asking
us
to
overrule
those
cases
and
to
reexamine
this
whole
problem
of
the
--
this
aspect
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
john
m.
harlan
fourteenth
amendment,
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
do
with
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
do
you
do
with
the
mccollum
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
said
that
religious
instruction
in
your
opinion
was
the
thing
that
differentiated
this
case
from
the
situation
that
you
have
if
this
was
a
religious
exercise
in
an
avowal
of
faith.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
thought
you
said
that
--
you
thought
your
case
was
different
and
do
not
come
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
this
was
not
a
religious
exercise
but
merely
an
--
but
merely
instruction,
ethical
instruction.
justice
john
m.
harlan
(inaudible)
so
if
you
face
this
problem,
frankly,
that
what
these
cases
really
present
us
with
is
whether
we're
going
to
reexamine
the
premises,
right
or
wrong,
of
our
past
cases
in
which
these
issues
have
been
decided.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
isn't
that
--
that's
the
real
problem
in
the
case.
justice
john
m.
harlan
yes.
i
think
so,
too.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
many
--
i
think
i
remember
a
figure
(inaudible)
of
this
religious
sect
(inaudible)
is
that
the
(inaudible)
right?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
we
had
it
at
the
time
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
267,
something
to
that
order.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
did
you
accept
the
local
option
argument?
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
your
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
this
come
up
on
demurrer
or
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
old
are
these
youngsters?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
get
--
i
don't
get
the
last
part.
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
don't
get
it
but
i
understand
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
alright.
i
hear
you.
justice
john
m.
harlan
one
thing
i
--
i
gather
to
that
is
that
they
need
a
teacher
or
have
more
witnesses
to
testify.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
thought
there's
no
point
in
relying
to
this
but
i
didn't
know
if
the
statute
for
--
said
that
the
teacher
not
only
have
to
read
but
be
enthusiastic
about
it.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
that
junction
go
into
effect?
justice
john
m.
harlan
what
page
is
that?

john
