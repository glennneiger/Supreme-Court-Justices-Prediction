mr.
john
d.
killian,
iii
your
honor,
may
i
make
a
short
statement,
about
the
--
mr.
john
d.
killian,
iii
--
at
the
end
of
the
argument?
mr.
john
d.
killian,
iii
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
john
d.
killian,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
i
will
--
amicus
brief
as
the
court
has
indicated
a
bizarre
big
thing,
but
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
today
is
a
practice
that
goes
back
in
pennsylvania
far
into
the
days
of
its
history.
this
practice
as
before
the
court
today
is
a
codified
practice.
the
codification
occurred
in
1913,
but
the
practice
goes
back
deep
into
the
colonial
days
of
our
state.
the
practice
is
not
as
the
other
as
mr.
sawyer
indicates
a
religious
practice;
it
is
an
educational
practice.
it
is
a
practice
in
the
schools
which
has
educational
values.
we've
been
talking
about
the
moral
values
that
are
provided
by
this
practice.
it
is
not
a
religious
practice.
dr.
boehm,
the
superintendent
of
public
instruction
in
his
testimony
in
the
lower
court
was
asked
whether
this
practice
contained
educational
value
and
in
his
testimony
at
page
89
of
the
record
states
that
he
thinks
that
the
reading
of
the
bible,
i'll
read
out
a
few
words
“is
one
of
the
last
vestiges
of
moral
value
that
we
have
left
in
our
school
system.”
this
stands
out,
i
quote
him,
“as
a
strong
contradiction
to
the
materialistic
trends
of
our
times.”
certainly,
this
practice
reflects
the
religious
origins
and
traditional
religious
levin
of
our
public
life.
the
practice
of
reading
the
bible
existed
in
the
colonial
days
as
a
reading
exercise
and
for
the
purpose
of
moral
instruction.
but
it
is
fundamentally
and
has
always
been
in
pennsylvania,
educational
practice.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
when
you're
studying
the
arts,
you
have
to
study
sacred
themes,
you
have
to
study
sacred
music
if
you
want
to
be
a
musician,
and
if
you
want
to
be
a
good
citizen
and
you
want
your
schools
to
educate
you
that
way,
you
must
study
morality
and
what
better
source
of
morality
is
there
than
this
bible.
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
was
codifying
a
conclusion
that
the
people
of
pennsylvania
long
before
reach
that
the
bible
is
a
source
of
this
morality.
now,
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
we
are
religious
people,
that
there
is
a
religious
labeling
on
our
society
and
we
manifest
and
express
this
religion
in
many
ways.
many
of
these
have
been
briefed
and
discussed
then
these
arguments
are
need
not
go
into
but
the
court
has
also
said
in
some
opinions
that
if
we're
going
to
work
this
levin
out
of
our
society,
we
have
to
do
it
by
--
through
the
individual
and
through
groups
and
not
through
the
government.
the
government
should
be
neutral,
it
should
not
be
hostile.
and
we
feel
that
the
ripping
out
of
this
practice
out
of
the
public
schools
as
an
educational
practice
would
express
hostility
to
religion.
