mr.
thomas
b.
finan
may
it
please
the
court.
i
personally
want
to
thank
mr.
burch
for
giving
us
a
portion
of
his
time
to
intervene
here
as
amicus
curiae
and
also
to
thank
the
attorneys
general
of
some
18
states
of
our
sister
states
in
the
union
who
have
joined
with
us
as
amicus
curiae.
the
appendix
to
our
brief
also
contains
a
compilation
of
some-39
sister
states
who
have
similar
provisions
concerning
the
devotional
exercise
of
some
type
in
public
schools.
mr.
chief
justice,
a
moment
ago
asked
about
hawaii
and
the
appendix
there
as
a
reference
to
the
rule
in
hawaii
which
does
permit
a
devotional
exercise
but
forbids
the
teaching
of
religion
in
the
public
schools.
we
go
along
with
the
city
solicitors
from
baltimore's
contention
that
this
is
primarily
an
exercise
within
the
school
to
create
a
climate
of
wholesomeness,
of
moral
and
ethical
standard
rather
than
essentially
that
of
religious
service.
however,
we
will
go
further
than
his
contention
in
that
regard.
i'll
put
it
this
way.
we
concur
insofar
as
he
goes
in
that.
we
will
go
further
and
state
that
we
feel
before
this
court,
as
again,
the
situation
as
to
whether
they
should
reevaluate
this
entire
position
which
they
have
taken,
including
the
position
of
the
court
in
the
engel
case.
we
feel
this
can
be
distinguished.
i
disagree
with
mr.
burch
and
i
didn't
agree
with
the
court's
conclusion
in
the
engel
case
but;
nonetheless,
we
feel
that
this
case
can
be
distinguished;
however,
i
do
feel
that
this
line
of
cases
are
bringing
before
the
court
a
question
of
religion
laid
bare
past
its
bones
to
its
very
essence.
i
think
the
court
is
forced
into
the
conclusion
of
two
concepts
whether
it
will
consider
that
nontheism
should
override
theism.
the
opponents
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
have,
of
their
own
volition
and
according
to
the
decision,
i
think,
of
the
court
particularly
in
the
torcaso
case,
have
equated
nontheism
or
atheism
with
a
religion
which
it
is
entitled
to
that
position
under
the
umbrella
of
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
now,
assuming
that
it
is,
then
we
have
two
concepts
which
are
so
diametrically
imposed
it
to
be
neutrally
exclusive.
and
although
the
petitioner
would
have
us
believe
that
there
is
a
ground
of
neutralism,
there
is
a
vacuum,
as
it
were,
which
could
be
maintained
in
this
field
so
that
nobody
would
be
injured,
so
that
nobody's
sensibilities
would
be
stepped
upon.
we
assert
that
that
is
a
fallacy,
that
once
you
say
that
you
must
remove
the
idea
of
theism
and
for
what
are
--
time
to
elaborate,
let's
call
this
a
theistic
approach
or
a
theistic
climate
in
the
school
or
to
--
when
you
do
away
with
that
you
are
in
effect
giving
in
and
surrendering
to
those
who
want
a
nontheistic
climate,
and
that
nontheistic
climate
is
in
effect,
by
indirection,
giving
a
facial
sanction
to
their
religion,
which
is
nontheism.
and
i
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
believe
as
fervently
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
believe
as
fervently
in
much,
mr.
justice?
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
of
atheism
and
christianity
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that
is
correct,
mr.
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
correct,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
correct.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
theism
is
broader
than
christianity.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
you
said
atheism
as
advert
to
christianity.
my
point
is
theism
is
broader
than
christian
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
--
than
the
concept
of
christianity.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
that
is
debatable
because
you
can
read
in
the
kaddish
which
is
an
ancient
book
of
the
hebrews
almost
verbatim.
in
fact,
unless
someone
listens
very
attentively,
they
would
not
know
the
difference
between
prayers
in
the
kaddish
from
the
lord's
prayer,
which
goes
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
pardon?
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i'm
sure
they
would
--
further,
would
be
no
objection.
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
with
this
regard,
my
time
is
running
short,
if
i
may.
the
court
asked
mr.
baker
what
would
be
the
next
thing
to
go
as
it
were,
and
i
submit
that
the
barnette
case
which
the
court
is
familiar
was
tried
in
1943
and
that
was
the
salute
to
the
flag
case
up
in
west
virginia.
and
as
a
result
of
that
case,
it's
been
held
that
--
or
at
least
the
construction
placed
on
it
is
that
to
pledge
allegiance
to
the
flag
of
the
united
states
can
be
a
part
of
the
ritual
in
the
public
schools
as
long
as
those
who
do
not
wish
to
take
it
can
be
excluded.
now,
in
1954,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
inserted
in
that
pledge
of
allegiance
the
clause,
“one
nation
under
god”
and
that
is
what
is
in
the
official
pledge
of
allegiance
to
the
flag
today.
there's
been
no
case
since
that
was
inserted,
to
my
knowledge,
by
the
congress.
and
i
state
--
that
i
cannot
see
the
distinction
between
a
school
system
and
this
prevails
in
practically
every
board
of
education
in
the
united
states
requiring
a
child
to
--
or
at
least
not
requiring
the
child
but
proposing
that
exercise
as
open
in
the
morning
with
a
salute
to
the
flag
of
the
united
states
which
carries
in
it
the
clause,
“one
nation
under
god.”
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
because
that
is
the
basic
objection
to
which
these
people
object
right
now
as
a
recognition
of
a
supreme
being
of
what
i
call
theism,
i
think
even
the
theos
would
come
under
the
broad
term
of
theism.
but,
i
cannot
see
any
difference
between
that
case
and
what
we
have
before
the
court
today
because
you
have
the
same
outlet
of
freedom
from
exposure
by
walking
out
of
the
room,
and
it's
true
that
this
is
in
a
more
formal
style,
but
it
has
still
the
same
recognition
of
a
deity
which
is
the
basis
of
their
objection
rather
than
anything
else
and
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
might
be
in
the
proceedings
or
pleading
in
practice
procedure
in
maryland.
we
assume
that
all
things
that
are
well
pleaded
or
admitted
by
a
demurrer
and
in
that
admission,
not
only
are
the
bare
facts
as
recited
in
the
petitioner's
bill
of
complaint,
but
you
also
must
take
into
effect
all
the
exhibits
which
are
filed
at
the
time
that
the
demurrer
is
likewise
filed.
and,
at
that
posture
of
the
case,
the
board
of
education,
in
its
answer
were
well
aware
as
a
part
of
the
exhibits
was
the
provision
under
rule
6
that
he
did
not
have
to
stay
in
the
classroom
when
this
was
recited,
that
he
could
walk
out
of
the
classroom.
and
knowing
that
that
was
a
part
and
parcel
of
the
rule,
reading
that
also
into
the
bill
of
complaint,
the
answer
i
think
gets
around
the
objection
which,
if
i
may,
that
your
--
the
--
mr.
justice
have
just
mentioned.
at
least
that's
to
my
mind
is
the
fact
that
it's
--
it
was
a
demurrable
bill
of
complaint
when
you
read
into
the
bill
of
complaint
this
rule
6
which
is
a
part
of
the
exhibits
and
was
filed
with
the
answer.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
your
honor,
justice
horne,
who
rendered
the
majority
opinion,
based
it
primarily
on
the
grounds
--
he
mentioned
that
but
based
it
primarily
on
the
grounds
that
he
placed
this
exercise
in
the
same
category
as
the
exercise
which
we
used
to
open
the
maryland
legislature
which
congress
uses
to
open
the
branch
of
the
house
in
senate.
in
fact,
they
used
those
specific
analogies.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
right.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
if
you
please,
mr.
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
the
two
allegations
that
he
has
there
are
consistent.
they
could
be
released
from
it.
i
have
to
stay
there
and
he
still
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
that
would
not
be
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
all
well
pleaded
allegations
are
admitted,
mr.
justice,
and
it's
our
contention
that
there
would
be
an
inconsistency
between
the
allegation
where
he
says
that
his
religion,
a
right
to
practice
it
was
interfered
with
and
the
fact
that
he
could
be
excused
from
the
service.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
of
course,
mr.
justice
black,
in
the
vitale
case
said
that
any
prayer,
any
official
prayer
composed
by
a
group
of
officials
or
sanctioned
by
the
state
as
an
official
prayer.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
no,
i
beg
to
differ,
mr.
justice.
i
concur
in
their
--
stating
this
is
not
primarily
a
religious
exercise.
it
is
part
of
our
heritage
and
traditions,
but
i
go
further
than
that
and
would
state
that,
assuming
it
is
or
was
a
religious
exercise,
i
still
feel
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
right.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
yes,
i
definitely
feel
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
no.
i
think
there
--
the
two
cases
can
be
distinguished
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
--
but
i
think
they're
both
involved
in
religious
exercise.
they're
both
involved
in
a
religious
exercise.
in
the
vitale
case,
you
had
a
prayer
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
--
composed.
and
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
--
this
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i
said,
“a
straight
--
state
drafted
or
state
sanctioned
official
prayer.”
now,
the
question
would
be,
maybe
it's
tautology
to
say
“official
prayer”,
again
goes
back,
it
means
a
prayer
composed
by
officials,
which
was
one
of
the
basis
that
we
thought
perhaps
distinguished
it.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
it
sanctioned
that,
yes.
it
said
--
or
the
douay
maybe
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
but
the
question
is,
these
are
prayers
of
tradition.
there
--
they
were
never
any
official
prayer
of
any
sect
or
any
group.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
right,
mr.
justice.
that's
our
situation
on
it.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
mr.
justice,
i
don't
think
that
sectarian
the
least,
i
wouldn't
agree
to
that
definition
as
employed
by
the
court.
i
feel
that
we
must
admit
and
i
freely
admit
that
there
was
a
theistic
background
in
this
exercise
which
is
--
which
was
objectionable
to
the
petitioners.
i
mention
that
because
i
think
that
perhaps,
theism
and
sectarianism
are
two
different
terms.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
right.
well,
that
comes
on
the
overall
theory
that
was
--
that
we
have
in
the
case
says
that
this
was
an
exercise
in
which
the
students
primarily
indicate
their
belief
in
god
and
his
benediction
on
what
they're
doing.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
your
honor
--
mr.
justice,
i
would
certainly
think
the
petition
would
indicate
that
that's
the
main
reason
that
they
object
to
this.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
no,
your
honor,
anybody
who
might
have
some
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
that's
correct.
i
might
add
that
the
actual
practice
of
this,
as
mr.
burch
started
to
commit
--
comment
to
the
court,
the
usual
practices,
it's
rotated
with
each
child,
each
day,
they
either
lead
the
prayer
or
read
the
bible
and
they're
quite
likely
there
might
be
some
child
who
might
not
want
to
read
the
bible.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
yes.
well,
mr.
justice,
on
the
premise
that
if
the
people
who
composed
the
school
board
in
that
particular
area
felt
that
that
expressed
the
majority
wish
of
the
people
that
those
who
did
not
conform
to
the
mormon
faith
or
who
felt
that
reading
of
the
mormons
--
book
of
mormon
was
objectable,
i'm
sure
there's
many
parts
of
it
that
practically
everybody
would
subscribe
to
that
they
are
free
to
walk
out.
i
think
that
is
the
basic
element
that
we
have
in
this
case
that
they
are
free
to
excuse
themselves.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
mr.
justice,
let
me
state
this.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i
think
that
--
i
doubt
very
much
that
there
would
be
any
race
in
that
direction
because
i
think,
primarily,
people
feel
that
if
they
--
children
can
have
some
religious
overtones,
take
children
that
are
in
--
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
children
who
are
in
religious
orphanages
and
our
correctional
institutions?
what
--
we
go
along
with
completely
removing
any
mention
or
anybody
on
the
public
payroll
in
any
public
institution,
anything
about
god.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
mr.
justice,
let
me
state
this.
i
think
we
can
carry
any
example
to
an
extreme
but
i
certainly
feel
that,
in
the
common
parlance
of
men,
that
we
all
have
certain
concepts
such
as,
i
mentioned,
recognized
works
which
recognized
a
deity,
book
of
mormon,
the
koran,
the
bible.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
the
what's
(inaudible)?
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
mr.
justice
(inaudible)
would
compel
me
if
there
was
--
there
had
to
be
a
choice
between
the
two.he
would
probably
stick
to
the
bible.
but
i
would
say
this
that
the
board
of
education
of
baltimore
city
might
well
go
along
with
the
reading
of
the
koran,
the
bible
and
the
book
of
mormon.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
justice,
that
this
rule
was
written
back
in
1906.
it
was
amended
later
to
allow
an
excuse.
i
feel
that
the
basic
thing
that
people
feel
today
is
that
we
must
not
set
up
a
fetish
against
mentioning
anything
about
religion
in
an
exercise
in
a
public
school.
i
think
that
the
public
is
willing
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
i
would
concur
with
the
court
and
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
no,
if
it
is
sincere
representation
of
that
area
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
they
would
have
the
right
to
and
i
would
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
yes,
mr.
justice,
because
i
feel
that
it
is
essential
that
we
keep
away
from
a
complete
secularism
in
our
outlet
to
this
thing.
and
if
the
christians
who
were
there
wanted
to
--
have
the
right
which
they
would
under
the
constitution,
that
is
the
sacred
right
as
a
minority
which
they
would
be
in
that
instance
would
say
--
would
have,
the
right
to
exclude
themselves,
the
right
not
to
be
subjected
to
them.
they
have
that
right.
i
see
no
reason
why
you
cannot
reconcile
and
why
it
is
not
compatible
to
--
under
our
constitution
to
permit
such
a
practice.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
they
would
still
be
educated
by
the
school.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
if
they'd
only
walk
out
for
that
portion
--
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
my
children
had
never
gone
to
the
public
schools
and
i'm
not
released
from
taxes.
so,
i
don't
think
they
should
be
released
from
taxes.
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
pardon?
mr.
thomas
b.
finan
well,
you
would
exclude

that's
right.
i
don't
--
i
might
just
say
this,
if
i
may,
in
conclusion
and
that
is
that,
as
i
understand
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
would
allow
the
bible
to
be
read
as
a
work
of
literature
or
as
a
work
of
ancient
religion.
and
our
basic
documents
such
as
the
declaration
of
independence
to
be
read
as
a
paper
of
state,
yet
our
--
if
i
understand
that
theory
correctly,
they
would
still
object
if
we
would
dwell
upon
the
declaration
of
independence
and
its
all
men
being
created
under
god
and
so
forth,
but
the
implication
of
a
creator,
if
we
were
to
read
that
as
a
source
of
inspiration
to
awaken
in
us
a
spurs
of
belief
that
we're
one
nation
under
god,
then
that
paper
in
itself
would
be
objectionable
only
if
it's
looked
upon
as
an
abstract
pure
state
paper,
the
same
way
with
the
bible
as
a
piece
of
literature
or
ancient
history.
