the
question
--
questions
literally
is
perfectly
[inaudible]
with
the
marketing
act
[inaudible]
in
the
marketing
of
florida
avocados
[inaudible]
and
its
applicability
in
federal
law,
it
would
be
applicable,
wouldn't
it?

the

court
excluded
the

the

[inaudible]
justice
arthur

then
what
is
the
reason
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
--
according
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(voice
overlap)
you
are
saying
that
because
the
department
of
agriculture
is
saying
that,
isn't
it
so?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
do
you
suppose
in
the
record,
the
decision
is
department
of
agriculture
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
your
argument
[inaudible]
that
the
department
of
agriculture
[inaudible]
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
you
are
to
say
that
[inaudible]
with
state
regulatory
scheme
which
is
based
upon
other
considerations?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
is
there
a
word
about
the
more
fundamental
point
that
investigates
commerce
under
interstate
commerce
clause
as
to
whether
a
state
does
exclude
an
agricultural
commodity
which
is
not
unhealthy
by
any
evidence
from
this
record,
which
is
produced
by
a
state,
which
is
palatable
and
by
only
stringent
character
that
all
rights
[inaudible]
or
impairs
the
interstate
commerce
under
this
record?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
not
the
marketing
regulation.
let's
talk
about
the
fundamental
constitutional
issue
of
whether
a
great
common
market
as
the
united
states,
one
state
then
exclude
an
agricultural
product
of
another
state
which
is
not
unhealthy
and
which
is
a
product,
which
has
[inaudible]
appears
palatable
crop.
that's
the
fundamental
point.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
take
the
west
indian
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
yes,
just
take
that.
that
is
a
type
of
avocado
which
matures
without
8%
oil
content.
it
is
not
a
bad
product.
it
is
not
unhealthy.
the
only
argument
i've
heard
you
make
is
that
it's
not
feasible
to
shipment
because
of
storage.
suppose
the
grower
decides
that
they
want
to
ship
it
by
airplane
so
it
can
get
to
california
quickly.
does
the
constitution
permit
california
to
exclude
that
product
from
california?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
why
is
it
in
effect
different?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
the
record
shows
that
the
west
indian
avocados
are
good
avocados
and
matures
without
any
8%
oil
content,
but
it
is
palatable
and
some
people
like
it
or
maybe
even
prefer
it
than
the
avocado
with
higher
oil
content.
now,
the
only
fact
that
the
--
is
in
the
record
is
the
fact
that
you
said
earlier
that
because
they
have
a
short
life,
they
may
not
be
feasible
practically
to
shipment.
am
i
misstating
the
record?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
would
your
position
be
if
the
short
life
of
the
west
indian
avocados
were
not
present,
let's
assume
the
[inaudible]?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
this
[inaudible]?
