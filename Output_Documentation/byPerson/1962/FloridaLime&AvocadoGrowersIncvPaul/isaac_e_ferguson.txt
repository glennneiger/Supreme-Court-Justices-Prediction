mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
may
it
please
your
honors.
this
case
is
here
for
the
second
time
on
direct
appeal
from
the
judgment
of
a
three-judge
district
court.
the
previous
appeal
was
from
a
judgment
dismissing
appellants’
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
that
judgment
was
reversed
by
this
court
because
it
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
try
the
case
on
the
merits
for
other
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
the
opinion
of
this
court.
the
present
appeal
is
from
the
judgment
after
trial
on
the
merits,
denying
the
relief
prayed
in
appellants’
complaint.
i
remind
the
court
that
the
appellants
are
growers,
handlers
of
avocados
produced
in
south
florida,
and
that
the
avocados
marketed
by
appellants
are
sold
without
restriction
in
all
states
of
the
union
except
california,
the
only
other
state
in
which
avocados
are
produced
commercially.
i
remind
the
court
further
that
all
of
the
avocados
grown
in
the
florida
production
area
are
marketed
in
interstate
commerce
or
directly
affect
interstate
commerce.
and
that
since
june
11,
1954,
all
marketing
of
the
florida
avocados
has
been
governed
by
a
marketing
order
made
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
of
the
united
states
pursuant
to
the
authority
vested
in
him
by
the
agricultural
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937.
the
essence
of
the
marketing
order
is
the
establishment
and
enforcement
of
standards
of
maturity
and
quality
as
the
condition
precedent
to
the
marketing
of
the
florida
avocados.
the
complaint
of
the
appellants
is
that
notwithstanding
compliance
with
the
maturity
and
quality
regulations
imposed
under
the
federal
marketing
order,
an
near
embargo
against
the
marketing
of
the
florida
avocados
in
california
is
enforced
by
prohibiting
sale
of
the
avocados
in
that
state,
unless
they
contained
8%
or
more
of
oil
or
fat
as
required
by
section
792
of
the
agricultural
code
of
california.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
oh,
yes
your
honor.
yes,
indeed.
it
follows
the
complaint
in
the
first
volume
and
begins
--
page
50.
this
8%
oil
requirement
is
foreign
to
the
nature
of
the
avocados
grown
in
florida,
also
foreign
to
the
maturity
and
quality
regulations
under
the
federal
marketing
order.
such
embargo,
appellants
contend,
flaunts
the
commerce
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution,
at
the
same
time
thwarts
and
undermines
the
effectiveness
of
the
regulation
of
the
marketing
of
this
fruit
under
the
federal
law.
on
the
previous
appeal
in
this
case,
it
was
held
by
this
court,
first,
that
a
three-judge
district
court
was
properly
convened
to
hear
the
case
since
the
complaint
seeks
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
a
state
statute
in
application
to
the
marketing
of
the
avocados
handled
by
appellants
on
substantial
grounds
of
federal
unconstitutionality.
second,
the
direct
appeal
to
this
court
from
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
was
proper
notwithstanding
the
joinder
of
a
claim
that
enforcement
of
the
state
statute
in
the
manner
complained
of
is
a
violation
of
an
act
of
congress
regulating
interstate
commerce.
third,
that
it
was
not
incumbent
upon
appellants
prior
to
consideration
of
their
complaint
in
accord
of
the
united
states
to
apply
for
the
desired
relief
in
an
action
in
the
california
courts.
fourth,
that
appellants
are
entitled
to
have
determined
in
this
federal
court
action
on
the
merits
the
rights
asserted
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
also
under
the
marketing
agreement
act
of
1937
enacted
by
congress
pursuant
to
the
authority
granted
by
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
it
said
in
the
opinion
of
the
district
court
that
but
for
the
direction
of
this
court
to
hear
and
adjudicase
--
adjudicate
the
case
on
the
merits,
the
district
court
might
either
have
declined
to
exercise
equitable
jurisdiction
in
the
case
or
it
might
have
withheld
exercise
of
jurisdiction
to
await
state
court
adjudication
of
the
controversy.
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
statement
of
the
district
court
is
quite
immaterial.
that
it
is
of
no
moment
how
the
district
court
might
otherwise
have
disposed
of
the
case
if
not
constrained
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
i
submit
likewise
that
the
reargument
by
appellees
in
the
form
of
cross-appeal
of
issues
decided
by
this
court
on
the
former
appeal
calls
for
no
consideration
on
the
present
appeal.
on
the
merits,
i
submit,
the
record
is
devoid
of
any
support
for
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
the
essential
elements
of
appellants’
case
are
virtually
uncontested.
the
most
striking
circumstance
of
this
case
is
that
nowhere
in
the
evidence
is
there
the
least
suggestion
of
fault
in
the
florida
avocados.
no
suggestion
of
unhealtfulness,
unpalatability,
or
inferiority
of
quality
in
any
respect.
the
challenged
california
statute
says
in
effect
that
all
avocados
with
less
than
8%
of
oil
are
immature,
but
no
witness
says
that
this
is
true
of
the
avocados
grown
in
florida
which
come
to
market
with
less
than
8%
of
oil
content.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
affirmatively
established
by
the
extensive
and
an
impugned
scientific
research
that
some
varieties
of
florida
avocados
attain
maturity
and
are
ready
to
be
marketed
with
oil
content
as
low
as
2%
or
3%,
while
other
varieties
which
may
ultimately
attain
8%
oil
content,
do
so
only
in
minor
volume
and
late
in
the
marketing
season
for
these
avocados
and
even
then
without
the
requisite
consistency
for
affecting
--
effective
marketing
in
face
of
the
8%
oil
barrier.
the
main
--
the
evidence
regarding
the
marketing
of
the
florida
avocados
covers
the
period
since
june
11,
1954
when
the
federal
florida
avocado
order
went
into
effect.
no
question
is
raised
by
the
appellees
as
to
the
validity
of
the
act
of
congress
pursuant
to
which
the
marketing
order
was
made.
however,
an
abortive
attempt
was
made
by
the
appellees
to
show
that
the
regulations
issued
under
the
marketing
order
and
the
methods
of
administration
thereof
have
failed
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
marketing
agreement
act.
oral
testimony
was
taken
and
a
great
many
exhibits
for
identification
in
furtherance
of
this
defense,
but
upon
the
trial
of
the
case,
the
defense
was
withdrawn.
nevertheless,
it
is
reasserted
in
the
brief
by
the
appellees
in
this
court.
it
set
forth
in
answer
in
appellants’
reply
brief.
the
reason
for
adoption
of
the
florida
avocado
marketing
agreement
was
the
need
to
establish
and
enforce
satisfactory
standards
of
maturity
and
quality
for
the
marketing
of
this
fruit
in
place
of
the
ineffective
self-regulation
then
prevailing
in
the
industry.
since
1954
by
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
from
season
to
season,
standards
of
maturity
and
quality
have
been
established
and
have
governed
all
marketing
of
the
avocados
produced
in
the
south
florida
area.
no
shipment
of
florida
avocados
is
permitted
without
a
certificate
of
compliance
with
these
regulations.
a
certificate
issued
after
inspection
of
the
fruit
by
the
joint
inspection
service
of
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
and
the
florida
department
of
agriculture.
in
california
alone,
on
arrival
of
a
shipment
of
avocados
from
florida,
the
federal
certification
of
the
fruit
as
of
requisite
maturity
and
quality
is
disregarded
and
instead
the
8%
oil
test
is
applied.
under
the
federal
regulations,
oil
or
fat
content
does
not
enter
into
determination
of
the
maturity
or
quality
of
the
florida
avocados.
by
a
decade
of
scientific
research,
the
years
1951
to
1955
by
dr.
roy
w.
harkness
at
a
subtropical
experiment
station
of
the
university
of
florida,
homestead,
florida
and
in
years
from
194
--
1954
onward
by
dr.
paul
l.
harding,
and
his
staff
of
assistants
at
the
united
states
horticultural
field
station
at
orlando,
florida,
also
at
the
agricultural
marketing
station
of
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
at
miami,
florida,
it
has
been
irreputably
established
that
oil
content
is
not
a
scientifically
valid
determinant
of
either
the
maturity
or
quality
of
the
florida
avocados.
that
there
is
no
consistent
relationship
between
the
oil
content
of
the
fruit
and
the
maturity
or
palatability,
that
some
varieties
of
the
florida
avocados
attain
maturity
and
maximal
quality
with
a
little
as
2%,
3%
or
4%
of
oil,
that
of
the
other
varieties,
although
some
may
ultimately
attain
as
much
or
more
than
8%
of
oil.
this
occurs
only
late
in
the
marketing
season
for
these
varieties
that
only
inconsistently
and
well
past
the
time
when
they
have
attained
maturity
and
are
ready
to
be
marketed.
it
has
also
been
determined
by
checkup
on
the
marketing
of
the
florida
avocados
from
year
to
year
since
1954,
that
maturity
and
palatability
of
these
avocados
is
assured
by
prescribing
permissible
shipping
dates
for
each
variety
of
the
fruit
in
each
season
in
correlation
with
attainment
by
the
fruit
of
specified
minimum
weight
or
diameter.
accordingly,
under
the
federal
marketing
order,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
in
each
season
since
1954
issued
maturity
regulations
establishing
permissible
picking
dates
for
each
of
some
40
varieties
of
the
florida
avocados,
dates
when
avocados
of
the
designated
variety
may
be
picked
and
shipped
if
then
of
the
specified
minimum
weight
or
diameter.
both
dr.
harkness
and
dr.
harding
were
examined
as
witnesses
in
this
case,
and
the
record
on
appeal
exhibits
the
nature
sent,
the
results
of
their
studies
of
the
maturation
and
palatability
of
the
florida
avocados.
no
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
district
court
in
making
that
finding
disregarded
entirely
the
testimony,
the
only
testimony
in
the
case
regarding
the
florida
avocados,
disregarded
all
of
the
testimony
of
these
witnesses,
leaving
no
testimony
in
the
record
of
this
case
to
support
any
such
finding
in
relation
to
the
florida
avocados.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
none
whatever.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
say,
no
counter
testimony
was
introduced
on
the
subject
nor
the
testimony
of
dr.
harkness,
dr.
harding
impeached
in
any
respect.
of
course
a
finding
without
a
vestige
of
support
in
evidence
--
this
is
no
way
binding
of
this
court.
there
could
be
no
finding
in
this
case
regarding
the
validity
of
this
standard
of
8%
oil
content
in
relation
to
the
florida
avocados
of
the
numerous
varieties
that
is
not
consonant
with
the
testimony
of
dr.
harkness
and
dr.
harding.
there
is
no
other
testimony.
there
is
shown
in
several
ways
in
the
record
of
this
case
the
inapplicability
of
the
oil
standard
to
this
as
proof.
many
thousands
of
oil
tests
were
made
in
the
research
project
conducted
by
dr.
harkness
and
then
in
subsequent
years
by
the
staff
of
the
department
of
agriculture.
they
established,
first,
affirmatively
that
these
avocados
do
come
to
maturity
with
less
than
8%
oil
content,
in
fact
many
of
them
with
less
than
a
half
of
that
oil
content.
that
the
other
varieties,
if
they
ever
attain
8%
oil
content,
do
so
only
five,
six,
seven,
or
eight
weeks
after
they
are
mature
in
accordance
with
the
standards
established
under
the
federal
regulation.
your
honor,
i'm
answering
your
question
at
this
time
in
a
sense
out
of
order
because
the
argument
to
which
i
am
now
directing
myself
is
the
fact
that
standards
have
been
established
under
federal
law,
that
these
are
the
standards
prescribing
the
condition
for
the
marketing
of
this
fruit
in
all
50
states
of
the
union.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
this
is
the
only
regulation
applicable
to
these
avocados.
there
is
no
prior
regulation
that
is
preempted
because
florida
had
no
standard.
florida
has
adopted
as
its
own
standards
fixed
under
federal
law
by
a
general
statute.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
go
ahead.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no,
that's
alright.
i
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i'll
do
it
right
now,
your
honor.
dr.
appleman
said
that
he
was
not
making
any
study
of
maturity
of
avocados,
but
his
contact
was
as
a
chemist
making
--
doing
certain
research
work
in
which
he
used
two
varieties
of
california
avocados
as
subject
material.
the
varieties
called
the
fuerte
and
hass
which
incidentally
account
for
the
overwhelming
share
of
the
whole
california
crops.
these
are
of
very
high
oil
content.
as
to
florida
avocados,
dr.
appleman
said
candidly,
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
florida
avocados.
in
fact,
he
did
not
claim
knowledge
of
any
varieties
of
california
avocados
other
than
the
fuerte
and
the
hass.
he
simply
was
permitted
to
say
without
any
support
whatever
that
in
his
opinion,
the
8%
oil
standard
was
the
best
available
at
this
time
and
of
course
on
his
own
test
to
me
--
testimony,
that
could've
been
applicable
only
to
the
california
avocados.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
--
from
the
standpoint
of
conflict
since
the
standards,
complete
standards
that
is
established
under
federal
law,
the
entire
california
standards
in
substitution
or
interposition
would
be
in
conflict.
but
the
only
question
that
has
ever
arisen,
the
only
basis
upon
which
florida
avocados
have
been
rejected
for
sale
in
california
is
by
the
oil
test.
that
is
on
page
87
of
the
brief,
the
appendix
with
the
caption
“oil
content.”
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
have
your
honor
found
it?
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
87.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
lower
part
of
the
page.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
federal
statute
vests
authority
in
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
establish
standards
of
maturity
and
quality.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
this
is
on
page
89.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
clause
3
of
7
u.s.c.a.,
section
602.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
through
the
exercise
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
federal
regulation?
i
say
it
is
--
does
not
use
oil
content
or
any
other
chemical
test
as
a
basis
because
research
has
proved
conclusively
that
it
is
not
a
valid
test
and
after
years
of
study,
and
by
experience,
it
has
been
established
instead
that
a
test
that
will
assure
proper
maturity
and
quality
of
the
florida
avocados
is
to
establish
each
season
taking
into
account
the
growing
conditions
in
that
season,
from
the
past
experience
generally,
the
dates
upon
which
avocados
of
the
particular
variety,
it's
a
standard
for
each
variety
not
a
--
and
across
the
board
standard,
the
dates
when
the
avocados
of
that
particular
variety
attain
a
certain
size,
certain
weight,
or
diameter,
it's
all
interchangeable.
not
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
--
the
procedural
provisions
may
not
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
oh,
yes.
it
is
--
the
marketing
order
in
the
brief,
no.
it's
an
exhibit
of
the
complaint
beginning
at
page
15
of
the
record.
then
the
particular
regulations,
there
are
a
vast
number
and
i
have
many
references
to
the
federal
register
because
they
are
made
over
again
each
season
and
in
particular
the
maturity
regulations
are
made
season
by
season
and
may
be
amended
during
the
season
in
conformity
with
any
change
in
the
growth
conditions.
so
that
i
could
only
answer
that
by
giving
you
which
i
have
done
in
the
record
of
this
case,
all
of
these
references
to
the
federal
register.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
well
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
florida
avocados
from
this
particular
production
area,
other
sections
of
the
act
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that's
right.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
the
statute,
as
your
honor
of
course
knows,
calls
for
marketing
agreements
with
respect
to
a
particular
commodity
in
a
particular
production
area
and
in
fact,
makes
it
the
smallest
possible,
the
smallest
practicable
area
and
this
is
the
production
area
in
florida
and
this
is
the
only
standard
applicable.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes,
your
honor.
i
say
that
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that's
right
using
that
as
the
standard
in
substitution
for
the
standard
established
under
federal
law.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
oh,
yes
it's
entirely
different
as
of
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
oh,
yes,
i
certainly
argue
that
it
does
bar
it.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
under
the
commerce
clause
and
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that
is
correct.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that
is
right.
only,
it's
a
correct
way.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
on
its
correct
way.
it
has
--
it
has
unquestionable
and
undisputed
scientific
support
in
the
california
standard
if
applied
to
the
florida
avocados
has
not.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
even
if
the
federal
--
as
far
as
--
as
far
as
we
invoke
the
existence
of
regulation
under
federal
law,
under
a
valid
act
of
congress
and
a
valid
order
made
pursuant
thereto,
i
would
say
exactly
what
your
honor
has
said.
but
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes,
your
honor
and
i
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that
is
right.
but
i
show
affirmatively
that
oil
content
is
not
part
of
the
federal
regulations
to
show
they
are
incompatible,
in
conflict.
in
other
words
if
it
were
merely
a
repetition,
if
the
state
standard
were
merely
a
repetition
then
it
might
be
argued
that
there's
no
conflict.
so
it
shows
affirmatively
by
overwhelming
evidence
and
undisputed
evidence
that
they
are
radically
and
fundamentally
different
so
that
there
is
conflict.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
florida
avocados
could
not
get
out
of
the
state
unless
they
complied
with
the
federal
regulations
then
the
situation
would
be
that
they
would
be
validated,
certified
under
federal
law
and
49
other
states
could
say,
“no,
we
don't
like
that
test.
we'll
try
a
different
way.”
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
they
--
that
they
do
what?
i
didn't
get
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
they
tainte
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that
would
certainly
be
a
harsh
criticism
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
of
the
united
states.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no
sir.
there
isn't
a
word
in
the
record
of
this
case
about
any
taint
in
the
florida
avocados.
all
that
appears
is
that
some
of
them
do
no
have
8%
oil
content.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no.
there
is
a
fact
--
a
claim
made
on
the
other
side
which
is
ironically,
and
this
is
part
of
dr.
appleman's
testimony
to
show
that
the
fat
in
avocados
is
not
of
the
type
which
creates
cholesterol.
now,
i
am
no
expert
on
this
but
if
he
says
that
that
--
apologizes
for
that
fat
and
he
says
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
and
it's
not
dangerous
fat,
not
dangerous
to
the
heart.
so
that
the
20%
or
30%
california
avocados
need
that
apology,
but
the
florida
avocados
with
their
low
oil
content
do
not
need
any
such
apology.
that
is
all
there
is
in
this
case
and
the
word
health
isn't
mentioned
and
of
course,
it
would
be
a
strange
situation
if
the
federal
government
in
making
standards
of
maturity,
quality
did
not
take
into
account
the
welfare
of
the
consumers
just
as
much
as
the
--
any
state
establishing
such
standards.
the
real
effect
of
the
thing
is
that
the
californians
are
told,
“if
you
want
to
eat
avocados,
you
have
to
eat
avocados
with
high
oil
content.”
you
can't
choose
to
take
the
avocados
with
low
oil
content
even
though
they
are
mature
and
of
good
quality
by
standards
established
under
federal
law
after
thorough
research
and
after
years
of
practical
experience.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
oh,
it's
not
that
the
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
not
to
the
consumers
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
but
they
--
they
don't
want
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
they
don't
want
the
competition.
that
is
true.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
and
that
the
commerce
clause
does
not
permit.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes,
it
gives
them
a
competitive
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
oh,
no.
no.
the
avocados
of
the
varieties
grown
in
florida
do
not
grow
in
california
and
vice
versa.
they
are
of
different
ancestry
and
they
are
a
different
character.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
there
is
no
blight
at
all.
it's
simply
that
they're
not
fatty
enough.
actually,
these
avocados
as
it
was
brought
out
on
the
farmer
field,
when
they
are
rejected
in
california,
are
permitted
to
leave
the
state
and
they
are
marketed
in
the
neighboring
states,
in
arizona,
in
utah,
in
oregon,
in
washington.
they
--
an
ironical
element
of
this
case
is
that
the
biggest
handler
of
california
avocado
is
taking
an
active
part
from
this
case
through
its
counsel
and
that
organization,
calavo
growers
of
california
served
as
the
selling
agent
for
the
leading
handler
in
florida,
one
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
sold
those
avocados
all
over
the
country
and
never
paid
any
attention
to
oil
content
and
resold
them
in
the
neighboring
states
when
they
were
rejected
in
california.
there
has
never
any
question
about
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no,
no.
there's
been
no
retaliatory
legislation
but
that
is
just
what
the
commerce
clause
is
to
prevent.
now
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
not
–
no,
no.
they
--
they
have
no
marketing
agreement
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
--
either
state
or
federal
that
has
to
do
with
the
maturity
or
quality.
they
presently
have
some
agreement
that
has
to
do
with
joined
together
to
promote
the
marketing
and
that
is
the
only
one,
that
is
the
state
regulation
as
far
as
this
old
--
this
old
standard,
it's
quite
old
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
1925,
i
think
in
its
1925
and
probably
1933
in
its
present
form
and
there
is
--
that
of
course
was
done
directly
in
the
act
and
in
the
act
is
of
a
rigid
nature
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
in
the
state
--
yes.
that
has
never
been
changed
because
they
found
that
it
worked
quite
satisfactory
to
keep
out
florida
avocados.
there
is
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
prefer
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
prefer
not
to
answer
that
question
because
i
don't
want
to
argue
the
california
law
in
application
to
california
avocados
because
that's
not
my
case.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
as
a
matter
of
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
a
further
answer
to
the
question
about
dr.
appleman,
i
elicited
in
cross-examination
that
to
his
knowledge,
research
work
was
being
in
california
at
the
citrus
experiment
station
at
riverside
by
the
scientists
there
which
is
in
challenge
of
the
oil
content
as
a
standard
even
for
the
california
avocados.
and
dr.
veen,
dr.
sinclair
who
are
doing
that
work
were
not
called
as
witnesses
in
this
case
by
the
state
although
they
are
in
a
sense
state
employees,
instead
dr.
appleman
was
called
who
knew
of
this
work
and
hadn't
even
read
the
writings
of
these
scientists.
but
i
say
again,
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
don't
want
to
try
the
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
and
i
would
go
--
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record
to
answer
your
question
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
would
be
irrelevant
to
the
present
case.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
and
to
the
present
case,
yes.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no.
and
that
is
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
and
your
honors
would
see
how
thorough
that
study
has
been.
i
would
like
to
diverge
probably
marketing
order,
the
contention
that
the
california
standard
cannot
validly
be
substituted
for
the
federal
standard
to
say
that
there
is
another
aspect
to
the
case
that
even
independently
of
the
congressional
enactment
and
the
establishment
of
federal
regulation
thereunder
that
the
restriction
of
sale
of
the
florida
avocados
in
california
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
175
years
ago,
the
authors
of
our
national
constitution
then
clause
3
of
section
8,
article
1
of
that
very
document,
first
thing
in
congress,
plenary
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
several
states,
the
provision
accounting
in
large
part
for
the
making
and
adoption
of
the
constitution.
there
by
as
construed
by
this
court,
there
was
established
at
one
stroke
a
common
market
of
all
the
states,
a
market
rid
of
all
barriers
against
the
free
flow
of
commerce
from
state
to
state,
a
market
to
be
kept
immune
from
all
such
barriers.
great
many
cases
have
come
to
this
court
wherein
state
or
municipal
action
claimed
to
be
valid
within
the
--
of
the
local
police
power,
has
been
challenged
under
the
commerce
clause
because
of
direct
or
indirect
interference
with
interstate
commerce.
and
the
rulings
of
these
cases
have
turned
upon
consideration
of
the
precise
nature
of
the
challenged
local
action
and
the
precise
effect
of
such
action
upon
interstate
commerce,
if
any.
the
result
of
these
cases
if
generalization
may
be
ventured
is
that
the
police
power
of
the
state
and
of
the
municipal
governments,
no
matter
how
broadly
defined
has
not
been
permitted
to
override
the
national
interest
by
arbitrary
and
burdensome
infringement
upon
the
freedom
of
interstate
commerce
envisaged
by
the
commerce
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
in
the
case
at
bar,
an
agricultural
standard
a
--
standardization
law
of
california
when
applied
to
avocados
grown
in
florida
and
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
results
in
nearly
total
exclusion
of
sale
of
this
fruit
in
california.
at
best,
sporadic
sales
late
in
the
season,
no
opportunity
to
market
when
the
avocados
are
ready
for
marketing
under
the
federal
regulation,
no
ability
to
promise
deliveries
at
the
state
that
interposed
that
would
be
desired
by
a
chain
of
supermarkets,
so
at
most
these
shipments
that
have
been
made
to
california
are
of
that
limited
and
sporadic
character.
it
is
argued
that
this
standardization
law
protects
potential
california
consumers
from
purchase
of
immature
avocados.
truth
is,
however,
that
the
california
8%
oil
requirement
when
applied
through
the
avocado
shipped
from
florida
denies
to
the
people
of
california
opportunity
to
buy
the
avocados
which
are
of
their
nature
of
low
oil
content,
but
are
nonetheless
mature
and
wholesome
and
of
excellent
quality.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
well,
i
have
no
way
of
urging
that
because
the
legislatures
are
best
at
are
--
act
are
long
gone
and
it
would
make
no
difference.
it's
the
practical
effect
and
no
matter
what
was
the
basis
motive
then
or
the
basis
for
judgment,
the
test
now
is
according
to
present
day
horticultural
science
and
present
day
experience.
as
it
was
recently
stated
i
think
in
mr.
justice
clark's
opinion
with
citations
in
baker
versus
carr
and
i
have
cited
some
of
the
same
cases.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes,
sure.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
well,
in
that
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
they
have
done
so
and
they're
hanging
on
to
it
because
it
protects
them
against
competition.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
could
they?
oh!
yes,
they
have
federal
marketing
agreements
in
california
and
large
scale
for
other
commodities
but
not
avocados.
this
thing
has
remained
just
set
all
these
years
for
a
very
obvious
reason.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
oh,
that
would
be
a
matter
for
judgment
then
that
would
ultimately
be
made
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
according
to
the
advice
he
would
receive
from
persons
in
the
industry,
from
scientists
who
have
made
the
study
of
the
subject.
it
would
be
his
judgment
and
whether
he
would
take
oil
for
california
avocados,
i
have
no
way
of
answering
that
except
to
say
i
doubt
it,
but
again,
i'm
back
in
california,
you
see.
but
they
couldn't
do
that
of
themselves.
every
one
of
these
regulations
is
submitted
and
it's
done
by
a
committee,
the
word
self-help,
you
must
look
at
the
other
man's
brief
that
play
upon
that
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that's
right.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
anything,
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
well,
that
is
in
its
nature
a
recommendation
and
that
these
meetings
of
the
committee,
there
are
present
representatives
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture.
then
they
are
submitted
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
with
a
basis,
with
the
statement
of
the
basis
for
the
recommendations.
then
having
in
mind
that
that
ground
here
that
the
--
most
the
people
in
florida
want
to
get
away
from
any
marketing
that
would
hurt
the
industry,
it's
quite
manifest
that
this
committee,
even
if
it
had
final
say,
would
be
--
undermine
the
industry,
destroying
the
industry
if
they
didn't
make
adequate
regulations
and
see
that
they
are
enforced.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
florida
might
well
have
adopted
standards.
it
didn't
do
so.
that's
why
the
federal
government
came
in.
the
marketing
agreement
act
had
advantages
which
florida
could
not
give
because
as
your
honor
knows,
the
marketing
agreement
act
avoided
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
it
was
the
kind
of
joint
action
that
might
have
been
challenged
under
the
antitrust
act.
it
also
had
other
possibilities
which
florida
could
not
have
given.
that's
why
the
growers
and
the
handlers
who
wanted
to
see
that
no
harm
came
to
the
industry
by
anybody
offering
undesirable
fruit
and
hurting
the
reputation
of
florida
fruit,
petitioned
the
secretary
of
agriculture
to
make
this
agreement
and
after
the
procedure,
it
calls
over
the
act
in
an
extensive
hearing,
it
was
found
desirable
and
necessary
in
the
general
interest
of
the
marketing
agreement
act
which
is
to
promote
the
welfare
of
agriculture.
i
think
in
a
mixed
way
of
arguing
the
situation
because
of
the
marketing
agreement
act
from
the
regulation
there
under
and
the
general
question
of
violation
of
commerce
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause,
i
say
this
is
the
only
result
here
of
this
regulation
so
far
as
the
florida
avocados
is
concerned,
is
invidious
discrimination.
it
keeps
out
avocados
that
are
helpful,
no
way
deleterious,
but
you
can't
get
in
because
they
happen
to
be
varieties
which
are
of
low
oil
content
as
are
probably
most
of
the
avocados
produced
in
the
whole
world,
south
america
and
cuba
and
elsewhere.
so
that
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
i
was
figuring
out
the
light,
your
honor,
but
i
see
it's
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes,
five
minutes
altogether?
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
then
i
think
i'll
conserve
the
five
minutes.
i
thank
your
honors.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
yes,
i
did
sign
it.
yes.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
there
--
oh,
yes
indeed.
yes
indeed.
if
the
federal
law
states
certain
conditions
for
funds
how
--
in
that,
the
case
where
the
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
oh
yes,
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
well
there
is
--
oh
yes,
there
is
--
mr.
isaac
e.
ferguson
that's
right
and
here
it
is
absolutely
complete
because
it
is
the
only
standard
applicable
to
these
avocados.
just
a
moment
about
the
evidence
in
this
peculiar
after
trial
statement
that
they
were
not
admitted,
repeatedly
your
honors
will
see
that
these
depositions
were
admitted.
they
were
offered
and
admitted.
and
then
as
mr.
fourt
says,
he
wanted
to
--
have
them
read,
i
never
objected
to
having
them
read
but
the
judges
didn't
want
to
sit
and
hear
them
read.
and
the
--
he
said,
“we
object
your
honor
and
we
respectfully
ask
permission
and
request
that
they'd
be
read
in
order
that
we
may
make
objections
to
the
testimony.
we
have
a
written
memorandum
prepared
outlining
objections
to
each
proposed
item.
we
have
objections
to
many
of
the
answers
as
being
hearsay.”
then
judge
goodman
said,
“we
will
mark
the
depositions
in
the
evidence
and
we
will
reserve
ruling
on
the
objections
that
had
been
filed
when
we
have
had
a
chance
to
examine
them.”
and
mr.
fourt
protested
like
this,
“thank
you
very
much.”
then
at
a
later
time,
at
the
end
of
the
case,
when
the
court
told
us
what
they
wanted
in
the
way
of
a
transcript,
judge
albert
said,
“you
don't
have
to
reproduce
what's
in
this
record
that
was
before
this
court
for
all
these
depositions
were
here
before”
and
it
was
not
my
argument
that
they
couldn't
make
objections.
they
made
all
of
the
objections
they
wanted
to.
as
far
as
i
was
concerned,
there
was
no
ruling
on
the
objections,
no
place.
there
is
no
ruling
on
the
objections
and
the
elementary
rule
is
that
if
an
objection
is
made
and
not
ruled
upon,
then
it
is
nothing,
the
record
stands
and
it's
admitted.
this
is
repeated
several
times
that
these
depositions
and
the
exhibits
are
admitted
subject
to
objections.
this
after
trial
statement
is
not
a
ruling
on
objections.
a
typical
objection
is
that
the
depositions
were
taken
pursuant
to
depositions
--
to
stipulation
were
not
admissible
because
the
witnesses
--
it
wasn't
shown
that
they
resided
more
than
a
hundred
miles
away
from
sacramento.
the
depositions
were
taken
in
miami.
is
there
any
ruling
on
that
objection?
is
there
any
ruling
that
any
particular
thing
is
hearsay?
your
honors
will
look
in
vain,
any
place
in
this
record
for
rulings.
that
is
why
we
had
no
occasion
in
our
brief
in
this
case
to
say
anything
about
it
and
it
has
been
pointed
out
here
the
court
considered
them.
the
--
and
the
--
one
statement
is
that
they
considered
them
arguendo.
one
statement
is
--
it
considered
them
offers
of
proof.
i
made
no
offers
of
proof.
i
offered
them
in
evidence.
they
were
received
in
evidence
and
as
was
pointed
out
here,
even
in
this
post
trial
statement,
it
is
said
they
were
considered
by
the
court.
and
then
the
opinion
of
the
court,
it
says,
they
were
assumed
to
be
admissible,
all
assumed
to
be
admissible
and
considered
arguendo
whatever
the
word
arguendo
may
mean
then.
now,
it
is
admitted
over
and
over
again
here
in
the
briefs
of
the
other
side
that
the
west
indian
varieties
which
have
importance
as
particularly
one
of
them,
the
--
all
of
them
has
had
sizeable
production
and
could
have
a
great
deal
more.
and
it
would
come
at
a
time
when
it
would
have
a
very
favorable
market
in
california
in
september
and
october
when
california
avocados
have
practically
disappeared
from
the
market.
that
they
never
attain
8%
oil
content,
that's
admitted
here.
then
they
argued
the
merchantability
and
when
his
honor
put
the
question
what
is
--
what
would
be
the
case
if
they
were
delivered
by
airplane,
actually,
the
argument
is
suspicious.
the
practicability,
it
depends
on
speed
of
transportation
and
refrigeration,
both
of
which
have
advanced
greatly
from
year
to
year.
and
it's
a
merchant's
question
to
answer
whether
they
can
be
successfully
marketed
in
california
not
a
judicial
question
and
many
other
things
is
a
grossly
distorted
statement
here
about
dr.
harding's
testimony
about
oil
content
and
that
some
of
them
have
attained
20%
during
the
shipping
season
and
he
argued
nothing
--
he
stated
nothing
of
the
sort.
there
are
various
other
things
but
i
see
a
red
light
here
and
i
thank
your
honors
again.
