although
going
a
long
way
didn't
go
far
enough
to
bar
a
certain
type
of
regulation
on
the
state,
that
doesn't
[inaudible]
it
seems
as
many
other.
but
you
say
here
that
this
absolutely
bars
the
state
in
fixing
the
content
of
oil.
justice

that
--
you
mean
that
there
isn't
that
procedure?
justice

as
a
substitute,
the
question
of
whether
this
bars
the
business,
wasn't
that
your
position?
justice

that's
right.
justice

that
bars
you
not

haven't

the
federal
didn't
bar
you
in
evidence
as
you
refer,
up
to
date
[inaudible]
the
relevance
of
this
particular
statute.
suppose
your
expert
said
one
thing
and
said
another,
and
you
are
right
in
saying
that
the
federal
government
regulated
this
function
as
it
had
certain
phrases
of
the
labor
law,
your
argument
is
that
that
took
it
out
of
the
power
of
the
states.
justice

with
reference
to

is
there
any

your
florida

is
there
any

is
there
any
claim
then?
justice

he

inflicts
some

(voice

justice

black
i
understand
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
it
from
you
that
it
eliminates
of
any
possible
consideration
in
the
case
the
claim
on
the
part
of
california
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
california
raises
avocados,
importation
of
these
particular
avocados
bars
in
view
of
a
particular
peculiar
envy
to
the
crop
in
california.
justice

but
i'm
--
justice

i'm
not
talking
about
economically.
justice

well,
that's
--
justice

there's
no
claim

it
does
have

they
have
avocados
farmed
in

the
grown
avocados
in
yards.
justice

i'm
talking

i'm
not
talking

economic.
i'm
talking
about
interests
here.
justice

not
one
of
these
standards
of
the
law
that
is
based
on
the
idea

those
argued,
enter
into
the
state
and
you
find
the
[inaudible]
bringing
certain
fruits

it's
dangerous
for
their
fruit.
justice

isn't
that
the
case?
justice

did
florida
enacted
in

law
here
claiming
oil
content

the
california
should
be
barred?
justice

black
what
page
does
the
objection
of
the
evidence
appear?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
don't
quite
follow
you.
as
i
read
this,
[inaudible]
i
would
think
the
court
have
said,
“well,
i'm
just
considering
you
and
passing
on
one
other
statute
although
i'm
not
going
to
repeat
it
[inaudible]
and
i'm
passing
on
it
on
the
basis
that
they
made
this
offer
of
proof
and
i'm
considering
that
that
is
the
fact.
that's
what
it
sounds
like
to
me.
i
don't
understand
just
why
it
doesn't
mean
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
presume
they
thought
it
was
[inaudible].
they
didn't
pass
away
the
objections
though
they're
just
taking
with
[inaudible]
nevertheless
i'll
decide
against
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
suppose
it
was
passed
on
those
arguments
at
the
time
you
made
this,
where
are
those
subsequent
arguments
again
to
admissibility?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
wouldn't
have
been
the
reason
that
this
case
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
could
have
been
granted
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
decide
on
your
favor
on
the
theory
that
there'd
been
no
evidence
involved.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
by
no
equity
that
they
hadn't
suspiciously
shown
that
they
would
be
irreparably
injured
by
evidence
that
florida
avocados
need
to
be
barred
by
state
of
california.
is
that
your
question,
as
i
take
it
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
be
a
good
reason
to
send
back
the
case
to
review
the
law
and
[inaudible]
that
these
particular
persons,
or
this
particular
person
have
suspiciously
shown
that
the
individuals
who
are
going
to
irreparably
injured
by
what
had
already
been
served?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
you
really
don't
have
time
to
discuss
the
evidence
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
any
of
the
california
avocados
have
as
little
as
8%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
when
they
get
a
--
what
--
what
you're
talking
about
mature,
are
there
another
avocados
that
below
this
8%?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
difference
between
the
oil
content
of
avocados
supplied
in
california?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
are
they
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
brought
about
guatemalan
avocados
grown
in
guatemala?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
this
is
aimed
by
the
[inaudible]
that
type
of
avocado
grown
in
florida?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
that
variety?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
evidence
by
dr.
appleman
has
indicated
did
it
not,
that
he
didn't
know
about
florida
avocados?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
have
any
evidence
to
show
that
they
didn't
have
--
they
didn't
reach
the
qualifications
by
the
federal
standard?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
is
more
or
the
federal
standard
requires
[inaudible].
is
there
anything
in
your
view
of
any
evidence
suppose
--
you
--
that
these
have
been
turned
down
did
not
meet
federal
standards?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
idea
that
if
they
did
meet
federal
standards,
they
have
a
right
to
come
in
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
say
that
even
if
they
met
the
federal
standard,
they
didn't
have
the
right
to
come
in.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
that
you
had
a
right
to
make
the
standards
different
from
the
federal
standard.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
your
argument
on
the
merits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
what
part
of
the
objective
of
congress
doesn't
make
a
standard
finding
that
the
state
couldn't
require
high
standard
and
go
its
way
and
say
which
it
says
to
be
minimum?
justice
hugo
l.
black
issues
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
he
approve
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
approves
it
and
issues
an
order.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
is
this
kind
of
an
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
he
enforced
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
then,
do
you
think
that
that
is
[inaudible]?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
did
impose
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
one
of
them
was
that
he
can
make
a
standard
and
do
what
he
says.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
yet
you
think
california
[inaudible]?
i
just
don't
quite
understand
the
basis
of
your
argument.
well,
actually
the
information
has
been
put
up
--
justice
hugo

but
i'd
like
to
get
it
clear,
what
is
your
position.

can
average

the

can
change
that
if
it
wants
to?
justice

as
a
