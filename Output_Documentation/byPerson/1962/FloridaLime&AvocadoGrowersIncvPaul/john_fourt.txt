mr.
john
fourt
if
the
court
please
before
proceeding
to
the
problems
of
federalism
which
are
involved
in
this
case,
it's
necessary
that
we
make
comment
on
the
state
of
the
evidence.
as
by
way
of
example,
counsel
referred
that
to
the
evidence
that
the
california
statute
was
ultimate
--
practically
a
total
embargo
on
the
shipments
florida
avocados
to
california.
there
is
no
such
evidence,
no
such
proof
in
evidence.
what
happened
at
the
trial
was
that
handlers
produced
but
one
witness,
a
mr.
harding
who
was
in-charge
of
the
federal
research
program.
their
main
proof
was
in
the
form
of
depositions.
these
depositions
and
exhibits
take
297
pages
of
federal
record.
these
depositions
were
taken
pursuant
to
a
writ
of
stipulation
which
is
part
of
the
original
record
on
file
that
all
objections,
except
the
form
of
the
question
are
to
be
reserved
until
the
time
of
trial.
and
that
the
parties
then
may
enter
their
exceptions
to
the
depositions
as
if
the
witnesses
were
personally
on
the
stand.
now,
these
depositions
were
taken
before
a
notary
public
who
does
not
have
authority
to
hear
objections,
therefore
counsel
as
a
matter
of
practice,
the
taking
of
depositions
allows
wide
latitude
for
questioning
in
order
to
allow
--
for
discovery.
state
officers
then
at
the
trial
were
entitled
then
upon
objection
to
have
them
read
at
length
at
the
trial,
handlers
at
the
trial.
now,
the
handlers
are
the
handlers
that
mr.
justice
goldberg
referred
to
are
the
two
florida
appellants.
i
refer
to
the
parties
as
the
handlers
who
are
the
appellants
and
state
officers
who
are
appellees.
well,
handlers
at
the
trial
did
not
offer
to
read
the
depositions
and
exhibits
into
the
record
as
is
normally
done
instead
they
offered
them
in
mass,
and
state
officers
promptly
objected
and
asked
that
they
be
read
at
length.
the
district
court
reserved
ruling
on
the
admissibility
of
these
depositions
and
in
a
post
trial
written
order
after
the
parties
had
filed
briefs
in
which
both
sides
discussed
the
evidentiary
objections
to
the
depositions,
the
district
court
expressly
excluded
the
depositions
from
evidence.
mr.
john
fourt
sir?
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
in
toto.
297
pages
of
it,
the
depositions
--
mr.
john
fourt
the
court
gave
no
ground
in
its
written
order.
mr.
john
fourt
well,
the
point
here
is
twofold.
we
think
that
first,
if
handlers
wish
to
contest
of
this
exclusion
of
depositions
that
they
should
have
posted
in
one
of
the
questions
presented
in
their
jurisdictional
statement
which
they
have
not
done.
and
secondly,
that
in
this
mass
of
297
pages,
we
are
confident
that
much
of
it
is
inadmissible
and
that
it
is
not
incumbent
upon
the
district
court
or
in
this
court
to
go
through
each
page
and
separate
the
admissible
from
the
inadmissible.
therefore,
it
was
reasonable
for
the
district
court
to
exclude
all
the
depositions.
now
handlers,
both
in
the
trial
court
and
in
this
court,
assert
that
the
depositions
and
exhibits
were
in
evidence
at
the
time
of
the
trial
because
state
officers
in
our
previous
motions
to
dismiss
had
made
reference
to
them.
now,
in
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
trial
court
it's
proper
for
the
district
court
to
look
at
the
depositions
to
ascertain
its
jurisdiction.
this
court
so
held
in
land
versus
dollar,
but
the
party
filing
a
motion,
such
a
motion
to
dismiss,
does
not
waive
their
objections
to
the
introduction
of
the
depositions
and
evidence
at
a
later
time.
they
are
making
a
concession
provisionally
for
the
purposes
of
the
motion
only
and
this
is
the
ruling
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
circuits
on
motions
for
summary
judgment
and
motion
for
--
motions
for
judgment
in
the
pleading.
so
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
that
would
be
on
page
782.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
finding
paragraph
3
on
page
782,
plaintiff's
exhibits
for
identification
one
through
26
are
not
admitted
into
evidence
but
have
been
considered
by
the
court
as
an
offer
of
proof
by
plaintiffs.
mr.
john
fourt
the
--
yes,
i
have
to
answer
your
question
in
several
parts.
mr.
john
fourt
right.
the
--
because
the
trial
court
reserved
ruling
on
the
admissibility
of
the
depositions,
the
trial
court
did
look
at
the
contents
of
the
depositions
in
writing
the
memorandum
opinion.
then
they
instructed
the
winning
party
which
was
the
state
officers
to
prepare
findings
and
the
findings
as
we
have
gone
through
in
detail
of
our
brief
are
supported
by
the
evidence
in
the
record
and
do
not
relate
to
the
excluded
depositions
so
that
there
is
evidence
supporting
each
of
the
findings.
although
the
trial
court
in
its
--
although
in
writing
--
reaching
its
decision
did
consider
the
depositions
and
simply
found
them
unconvincing.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
at
the
trial,
state
officers
faced
the
problem
of
having
depositions
which
made
good
evidence
or
may
not
and
so
we
made
an
extensive
offer
of
proof
in
the
trial
court
that
if
the
depositions
were
admitted
and
particularly
the
lengthy
portion
was
related
to
oil
test,
then
state
officers
has
rebuttal
testimony
that
we
wanted
to
put
in
and
our
offer
of
proof
is
in
the
record.
now,
the
offer
of
proof
is
material
because
the
--
as
part
of
our
offer
of
proof
will
show
that
the
oil
test
techniques
used
make
the
florida
tests
on
the
avocados
fail
substantially
to
extract
all
of
the
oil
out
of
the
avocados
and
that
by
making
test
with
the
proper
equipment,
a
smashing
action
instead
of
a
cutting
action
making
test
on
florida
avocados,
we
first
test
with
their
method
and
then
our
method
and
our
results
are
substantially
higher,
greater
oil
contents
than
their
results.
now,
we
would
suffer
material
prejudice
then
if
the
court
is
going
to
look
at
the
depositions
because
we
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
rebut
that
testimony
in
the
trial
court.
and
indeed
the
district
court,
both
in
its
memorandum
decision
and
in
its
findings
and
judgment
expressly
reserved
to
two
state
officers
the
right
to
introduce
rebutting
testimony
added
through
the
trial.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
well,
on
the
merits,
there
will
be
--
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
but
we
would
--
there's
two
types
of
problems
here.
all
of
their
evidence
regarding
their
business
activities
in
california
was
excluded,
and
all
of
their
evidence
regarding
the
scientific
tests
on
the
oil
content
of
avocados
was
excluded,
and
on
the
narrow
issue
of
the
oil
content
of
florida
avocados
we
would
suffer
prejudice
when
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
the
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that's
quite
right.
mr.
john
fourt
i
think
in
fairness
that
on
the
equity
issue,
the
court
will
look
at
the
depositions
to
see
what
their
proof
would
have
been.
but
on
the
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
however,
it
is
our
position
that
even
if
you
do
look
at
the
depositions,
they
do
not
help
them
on
the
equity
issue.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
right.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
the
--
yes,
there's
no
proof
of
any
shipments,
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
but
now
directing
my
attention
to
that
point,
we
would
say
that
even
if
the
depositions
are
looked
to,
that
there
is
no
convincing
effort
of
irreparable
energy
[inaudible]
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
right,
no
showing
that
irreparable
injury
great
and
immediate.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
the
depositions
are
in
the
record.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
the
depositions
–
yes,
the
depositions
commence
at
page
146
of
the
record
and
go
through
to
page
445.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
the
difference
is
between
the
court
of
--
this
court
as
in
the
appellate
court.
looking
at
the
--
this
offer
of
proof,
the
depositions
to
see
if
the
evidence
supports
the
findings
and
we
think
that
it
may
not
do
so.
but
had
the
handlers
here
raised
the
point
that
material
prejudice
has
occurred
because
the
evidence
was
excluded
from
evidence,
then
the
court
have
--
could
have
looked
at
the
depositions
for
that
purpose.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
the
state
officers
renewed
their
objections
at
the
completion
of
the
handlers'
case
and
at
the
end
of
the
trial.
now,
here's
the
comment
of
counsel
for
the
handlers.
perhaps
at
this
time
i
may
--
i
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
i'm
sorry,
sir,
page
646,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page;
“perhaps
at
this
time,
i
may
make
a
suggestion
which
may
help
to
expedite
the
hearing
and
that
is
regard
to
the
depositions,
testimony,
and
exhibits.
my
suggestion
is
that
all
questions
of
relevancy
and
materiality
of
this
evidence
in
the
exhibits
1
to
22
inclusive
can
better
be
considered
by
the
court
in
the
arguments
of
the
case.
and
if
this
includes
questions
of
admissibility,
they
can
be
argued
to
the
court.”
now,
we
suggest
that
in
the
face
of
state
officers'
continual
objection,
we
want
it
be
read
in
the
record
that
this
would
be
invited
error
there.
mr.
john
fourt
it's
been
our
experience
that
the
depositions
are
read
at
length
before
the
court
or
before
a
master
and
that
appropriate
objections
are
made.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
the
state
officers
were
the
parties
objecting
to
this
procedure
but
we
really
can't
complain
because
we're
the
prevailing
party.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
and
objections
were
filed
by
the
handlers
to
the
trial
court.
mr.
john
fourt
it
was
submitted
on
written
memorandum
to
the
court
and
both
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
the
--
that
would
be
in
the
form
of
a
--
part
of
the
defendant's
brief.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
commencing
on
page
700
and
going
through
pages
722
and
then
at
the
--
there
are
several
exhibits
which
are
found
at
pages
748
to
756.
mr.
john
fourt
yes
that
is
when
a
tender
of
evidence
is
made
and
an
objection
is
made,
the
ruling
of
the
court
is
to
admit
or
reject
the
evident
--
the
offer
of
proof
from
evidence.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
our
position.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
that
is
the
ruling
we
desire
of
the
court.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
the
only
thing
that
happened
was
that
they
were
just
offered
according
in
toto
in
mass.
mr.
john
fourt
the
state
officers
objected
and
requested
that
they
be
read.
mr.
john
fourt
and
the
court
declined
to
do
so
stating
that
they
would
reserve
passing
on
the
question
of
their
admissibility.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
their
argument
in
the
trial
court
was
they
were
already
in
evidence.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
the
--
mr.
john
fourt
well,
yes,
well
the
two
--
there's
two
separate
questions
here.
yes.
their
argument
in
the
trial
court
was
that
because
we
had
referred
--
state
officer
had
referred
to
these
depositions
in
our
motion
to
dismiss
on
--
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
that
that
action
you're
referring
to
the
depositions
caused
them
to
be
placed
into
evidence.
mr.
john
fourt
and
our
argument
is
that
that
motion
was
--
did
not
place
them
in
evidence,
not
waived
our
right
to
object
at
a
later
trial.
mr.
john
fourt
the
order
appearing
on
page
782?
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
there
were
--
three
separate
--
yes
sir.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
from
the
language
of
the
memorandum
of
opinion
wherein
the
district
court
said
that
that
it
would
consider
the
depositions
and
exhibits
arguendo
but
it
--
that
it
would
reserve
ruling
on
their
admissibility,
but
that
it
had
--
the
trial
reserve
ruling
their
admissibility
and
that
if
it
was
necessary
to
be
admitted
into
evidence
then
we'd
be
given
an
additional
hearing.
mr.
john
fourt
because
of
the
prejudice
to
state
officers
that
we
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
put
in
our
rebutting
evidence.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
mr.
john
fourt
oh,
granted.
mr.
john
fourt
oh,
granted.
mr.
john
fourt
just
as
an
alternative
to
our
argument
--
to
one
of
our
two
arguments
in
the
equity
case.
now,
we
do
not
defend
the
united
states
district
court
in
its
action
in
not
reading
the
depositions.
we
were
objecting
all
the
way
through
it.
our
posture
is
though
that
we
can't
complain
because
we
were
the
prevailing
party.
now,
if
the
court
decides
to
remand
for
trial,
then
that
would
certainly
be
equitable
and
a
fair
way
to
dispose
off
the
problems
here.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
the
three
judges
did
not
--
apparently,
did
not
desire
to
--
have
to
seat
while
the
depositions
were
read
into
the
record.
mr.
john
fourt
you
cannot
consider
them
for
the
point
as
to
whether
the
findings
are
supportive
of
the
evidence
because
the
depositions
are
not
in
evidence.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
the
court
certainly
could
say
that
this
procedure
of
not
reading
them
in
was
error
in
--
into
the
--
mr.
john
fourt
no,
but
--
yes,
but
we
--
prejudice
if
you
look
at
them
we're
convinced
without
our
being
able
to
produce
rebutting
evidence.
mr.
john
fourt
well,
we
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
john
fourt
those
are
not
these
facts.
mr.
john
fourt
we
think
that
is
good
judicial
procedure,
this
court
should
not
do
so
on
evidence
not
admitted
--
on
proof
not
admitted
into
evidence
in
the
record
in
the
court
below.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
the
--
in
--
one
of
the
--
discussing
the
offer
of
proof
now,
one
of
the
handlers
has
not
shown
that
there
was
any
monetary
loss
at
all.
he'd
had
to
make
one
reshipment
out
of
the
statement,
but
no
monetary
loss.
mr.
john
fourt
i
think
that
it
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
but
there
are
other
parties
at
interest
here
and
that
is
the
consumers
of
california.
their
offer
of
proof
shows
that
for
--
96%
of
their
avocados
did
pass
our
inspection
standard
and
were
marketed.
and
--
mr.
john
fourt
i
--
the
record
does
not
indicate
and
i
have
no
information.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
now,
on
those
facts,
the
inference
could
be
drawn
that
they've
abandoned
business
operations
in
california.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
yes,
i
concede
that
two
inferences
could
be
drawn.
mr.
john
fourt
sir?
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
at
the
time
the
memorandum
was
written,
they
could
have
raised
the
question
on
this
appeal
that
the
district
court
committed
error
in
excluding
those
depositions.
now,
for
that
purpose
nor
did
he
determine
whether
the
exclusion
was
prejudicial.
the
deposition
and
exhibits
are
certainly
part
--
properly
part
of
the
record.
mr.
john
fourt
let
me
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
turning
to
the
preemption
issue,
i
think
i'm
going
to
stick
with
my
order
but
speed
up.
the
avocados
are
grown
commercially
in
california
and
florida.
now,
avocados
are
picked
for
commercial
marketing
in
a
hard
inedible
state
and
it
cannot
be
told
from
looking
an
avocado
whether
it's
mature
enough.
now,
if
the
avocado
which
is
picked
is
immature,
then
it
shrivels
and
it
becomes
inedible.
on
the
other
hand,
if
at
the
time
it
was
picked,
it
was
mature,
then
in
the
period
of
four
or
five
days
at
room
temperature,
then
it
will
soften
into
a
normal
fruit.
now,
the
problem
arises
in
the
avocado
industry
because
the
nature
sets
the
end
of
the
shipping
season
for
the
avocado
grower.
the
fruit
becomes
overripe
right
on
the
tree
and
drops,
so
the
only
control
the
grower
has
is
at
the
beginning
of
the
season.
now,
the
beginning
of
the
season,
the
price
is
high
and
so
there's
a
temptation
for
growers
to
ship
their
avocados
early
even
though
the
avocados
may
be
immature.
now,
for
this
reason,
california,
very
early,
sought
a
way
of
protecting
the
california
consumer
from
the
deceptive
marketing
of
avocados
which
were
immature.
and
it
was
observed
that
as
the
avocado
matures
the
oil
content
increases.
and
it
is
a
practical
matter
in
avocados
that
had
8%
oil
content
would
mature
into
a
soft
edible
fruit
and
avocado
that
had
less
than
8%
oil
content
would
not
so
mature.
mr.
john
fourt
there
are
varieties
which
--
mr.
john
fourt
well
--
well,
of
course
all
of
the
avocados
start
at
zero
and
go
up,
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
well,
yes.
virtually,
all
varieties
are
put
on
the
market
immediately
as
soon
as
they
hit
8%
oil,
oil
content.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
the
--
there
are
three
types
of
varieties
of
florida
avocados,
the
guatemalan
and
hybrid
varieties.
dr.
harding
testified
that
these
varieties
reached
up
to
20%
as
high
as
20%
in
oil
content
during
the
period
of
their
commercial
maturity,
during
their
shipping
season.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
and
these
varieties
during
the
1959,
1960
year
constituted
88%
of
florida
production
and
these
varieties
are
increasing
in
importance,
in
--
this
percentage
is
increasing
year
by
year.
now,
there
is
also
a
west
indian
variety
of
florida
avocados
which
--
in
which
the
--
some
varieties
are
very
low
in
oil
content.
other
varieties
during
their
shipping
season
would
be
both
below
and
above
the
8%
oil
content
standard.
now,
the
point
is
that
the
hybrid
and
guatemalan
varieties,
the
district
court
[inaudible]
can
be
shipped
to
california
because
at
--
during
the
shipping
season,
they
go
way
above
8%
oil
up
to
20%.
now,
the
guatemalan
varieties
are
highly
perishable,
more
perishable
than
the
florida
guatemalan
and
hybrid
varieties.
the
experts
testified
at
the
trial
that
the
--
because
of
this
perishability
and
something
the
industry
calls
short
shelf
life,
that
when
the
west
indian
variety
goes
into
a
grocery
store,
it
ripens
extremely
fast,
particularly,
after
long
transportation
and
these
experts
testified
that
by
reason
of
this
perishability,
it
would
not
be
commercially
feasible
to
transport
them
across
united
states
to
california.
now,
for
this
reason,
the
district
court
found
that
the
application
of
the
california
statute
to
west
indian
varieties
was
hypothetical.
now,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
in
a
--
really
handlers
case
on
the
commerce
clause,
burnham
commerce
then,
means
that
they
wish
the
california
statute
invalidated
on
a
hypothetical
situation,
that
is
the
west
indian
varieties
so
that
then
they
may
market
their
guatemalan
and
hybrid
varieties
in
california
free
of
the
california
requirement.
mr.
john
fourt
the
guatemalan
variety,
it's
a
variety
that's
traced
from
guatemala
but
it's
grown
in
florida.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
the
guatemalan
and
hybrid
varieties
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
now,
those
varieties,
during
their
period
of
commercial
marketability,
reach
as
high
as
20%
in
oil
content.
now,
for
that
reason
then,
the
inference
is
that
they
can
reach
and
be
marketed
in
california
at
the
--
which
requires
an
8%
oil
content
standard.
and
that
those
varieties,
the
west
indian
varieties
of
florida
avocados
which
would
have
difficulty
meeting
the
8%
oil
contents
here
couldn't
be
shipped
there
anyway
because
of
commercial
impracticability.
and
the
reason
that
they're
not
shipped
there
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
8%
oil
content
standard.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
yes,
his
testimony
referred
to
california
avocados.
now,
the
inference
there
is
that
for
the
california
varieties,
the
8%
oil
standard
differentiated
with
--
and
kept
out
immature
avocados,
and
that
the
--
those
88%
of
florida
volume,
guatemalan
and
hybrid
varieties,
that
goes
high
as
20%
could
also
meet
the
california
standard.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
now.
yes.
those
--
no,
those
were
lulas.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
well,
the
--
lula
is
a
subvariety.
it
so
happened
that
those
--
that
particular
type
was
a
lula
which
is
a
--
called
a
hybrid.
it's
one
of
the
hybrid
type
avocados.
mr.
john
fourt
they
reach
as
high
as
20%.
well
yes.
the
problem
there
is
that
if
you
take
any
avocado
and
you
pick
it
early
enough,
it
won't
have
8%
oil
content.
so
the
problem
is
to
keep
it
on
the
tree
until
it
reaches
8%
oil
content.
now,
the
california
packing
houses
make
oil
tests
at
the
packing
house
and
therefore
they
do
not
offer
for
market
the
avocados
unless
they
knew
it's
going
to
reach
8%
oil.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
so
--
yes.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
those
statements.
that's
our
position
neither
in
the
offer
of
proof
nor
in
the
evidence.
mr.
john
fourt
well,
the
problem
posed
by
your
question
--
mr.
john
fourt
no,
sir.
no,
no
proof
of
that
kind.
the
federal
--
mr.
john
fourt
no,
sir.
mr.
john
fourt
unless
they
complied
with
the
california
statute,
that
is
good.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
that
is
right.
and
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
and
the
reason
is
because
the
congressional
intent
in
the
federal
marketing
act
was
for
a
different
objective
than
the
california
statute.
now,
on
the
preemption
point,
the
legal
issue
presented
is
whether
there
exists
an
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
federal
marketing
act
of
1937
and
with
the
marketing
regulations.
now,
the
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes
sir.
the
legislative
objection
--
objectives
of
the
federal
marketing
act
was
to
allow
agricultural
industries
through
self-help
regulation
to
regulate
the
flow
of
agricultural
commodities
to
market
so
as
to
increase
the
parity
prices,
price
will
return
to
those
growers.
now,
concededly
within
the
scope
of
that
purpose
and
the
scope
of
the
delegation
of
authority,
the
federal
regulations
are
supreme.
mr.
john
fourt
the
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
yes.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
yes.
the
--
yes.
the
problem
here
is
one
that
that
the
regulations
are
characterized
differently
by
the
parties.
now,
the
basic
federal
regulation
is
called
a
marketing
order
and
it
is
drafted
by
the
industry.
the
industry
holds
an
election
as
to
whether
adopt
it
and
then
it
is
issued.
now
--
mr.
john
fourt
then
the
secretary
of
agriculture
issues
the
marketing
order.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that's
right.
now
--
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
he
enforced
it
in
the
sense
of
a
lawsuit
in
case
of
violations,
but
the
administration
of
the
marketing
act
is
in
the
hands
of
the
local
administrative
committee
and
--
mr.
john
fourt
right.
mr.
john
fourt
well
primarily
under
the
articles
of
marketing
act
of
1937
which
refers
to
especially
commodities
and
milk.
now
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
right.
now,
the
basic
regulation
then
is
the
marketing
order
but
there
is
no
regulations
itself
in
the
sense
of
anybody
have
to
do
anything
in
the
marketing
order.
all
it
does
is
just
authorizes
further
types
of
regulations
and
describes
the
types
of
regulations
that
can
be
issued
under
it
and
it's
of
course,
the
type
of
regulations
which
the
industry
agrees
may
be
imposed
on
itself.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
now
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
right.
now,
the
type
of
regulation
or
the
thing
that
happens
which
makes
--
puts
a
teeth
into
the
florida
marketing
system
is
something
called
--
a
regulation
called
limitation
of
shipments
and
the
limitation
of
shipment
order
which
respondents
call
regulates
the
flow
of
avocados
to
market
and
it
states
on
its
face
that
you
may
have
--
you
have
--
are
limited
to
the
larger
sizes
of
avocados
first
and
then
the
lower
--
smaller
sizes.
mr.
john
fourt
it
is
not
in
the
record
but
the
court
may
take
judicial
notice.
it's
27
federal
register
5135.
i
just
happen
to
pick
this
one
because
it's
the
1962
limitation
of
shipments.
mr.
john
fourt
i'm
sorry,
27
federal
register,
5135.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
now
--
mr.
john
fourt
we
believe
so
because
these
regulations
--
mr.
john
fourt
sir?
mr.
john
fourt
the
purpose
of
--
in
the
marketing
act
in
the
marketing
order
and
in
the
orders
limiting
shipments
of
records
is
to
improve
prices
to
the
growers
in
florida
and
in
controlling
the
flow
of
avocados
to
market.
this
enhances
or
stabilizes
marketing
conditions.
now,
marketing
conditions
then
control
this
flow
of
shipment.
now,
it's
true
that
the
industry,
that
the
--
these
four
handlers
and
five
growers
may
very
well
consider
maturity
of
--
the
maturity
of
the
fruit
but
it
will
certainly
also
consider
the
supply
and
demand
factors.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
marketing
order
requires
that
the
--
this
in
--
and
called
them
administrative
committees
that
the
administrative
committee
make
estimates
of
the
supply
of
avocados
available
for
marketing
and
the
demand
of
avocados
in
the
market
and
it's
these
types
of
factors
then
which
cause
this
industry
committee
to
make
recommendations
regarding
what
kind
of
flow
of
(voice
overlap)
to
the
market.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
and
that
the
--
mr.
john
fourt
we
find
it
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
agricultural
marketing
act
which
indicated
that
the
states
were
to
be
left
free
to
impose
their
own
regulations.
mr.
john
fourt
the
--
it's
cited
in
our
brief
and
it's
also
the
references
in
the
congressional
record
79,
congressional
record
9480
and
it's
in
our
brief,
the
legislative
history
of
the
agricultural
marketing
act
of
1937.
mr.
john
fourt
the
federal
marketing
act
was,
as
you
just
has
stated,
economic
in
effect
designed
to
be
controlled
by
the
local
industry
and
administered
at
the
local
level.
now,
for
example,
if
the
local
grower
feels
that
the
shipping
limitation
is
too
restrictive,
he
may
go
to
the
administrative
committee
and
obtain
an
exemption.
he
doesn't
have
to
go
to
the
secretary
of
agriculture
and
these
powers
of
exemption
are
in
the
hands
of
this
local
administrative
committee.
well,
we
want
to
give
an
example
of
the
type
of
situations
we
think
would
exemplify
our
argument.
if
for
example,
avocados
left
flor
--
the
florida
marketing
area
and
they
were
of
sufficient
size
to
meet
the
federal
regulation
but
they
arrived
in
california
coated
with
a
deadly
spray,
we
believe
that
california,
under
its
police
power
would
be
entitled
to
inspect
those
avocados
for
that
deadly
spray.
now,
to
be
sure,
our
statute
which
is
intended
to
protect
the
consumer
from
receiving
immature
avocados
is
not
so
dramatic.
but
we
think
that
that
there's
no
intention
of
congress
to
prevent
the
state
from
exercising
this
type
of
protection
for
its
consumers.
now,
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
john
fourt
no
such
contention.
florida
avocados
are
welcome
to
california.
mr.
john
fourt
well,
yes.
i
suppose
it
is.
the
parties
differ
on
that
but
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
record
will
show
that
the
--
there
is
a
period
of
time
perhaps
when
the
low
point
of
the
california
production
in
which
if
the
florida
avocados
can
meet
our
standard,
be
very
welcome,
typically
welcomed
in
california.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
because
of
the
different
objectives
of
the
federal
regulation
and
the
state
regulation
that
the
federal
regulation
is
entitled
--
has
intended
to
enhance
the
returns
to
the
growers
of
florida.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
yes,
if
congress
had
enacted
a
statute
which
was
intended
to
protect
the
consumer
of
avocados
then
we
think
that
preemption
might
well
occur.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
yes.
i
need
more
information.
i
want
--
i
need
to
know
if
the
objective
was
to
protect
the
grower
back
home,
increase
his
returns
or
if
the
objective
was
to
protect
the
consumer.
if
the
objective
was
to
protect
the
consumer,
i
would
say,
yes,
preemption
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
no.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
i
would
agree
if
you
--
mr.
john
fourt
we
think
it's
open
to
question
here
whether
these
orders
called
limitation
of
shipments
deal
with
maturity.
the
--
literally
when
you
read
them
they
deal
with
the
flow
of
avocados
to
market
and
indeed
the
several
issues
of
the
federal
register
show
that
these
regulations
were
changed
through
the
year.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
but
they're
talking
about
--
i
believe
what
they
intended
there
was
to
mean
the
correlation
of
the
supply
of
agricultural
commodity
market
with
the
demand
for
that
commodity.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that's
quite
right.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
correct.
i
unders
--
i
think
though
that
that
notwithstanding
that
they
deal
with
these
things
that
you
look
to
the
congressional
objective
of
the
statute.
we
have
different
objectives
here.
one
is
economic
for
the
enhancement
of
the
industry.
indeed
the
regulations
are
controlled
by
the
industry.
now
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
john
fourt
that
is
correct.
now
if,
as
we
pointed
out
here,
the
program
is
managed
--
administered
at
local
level
by
the
florida
avocado
industry,
the
program
can
be
terminated
by
a
majority
vote
or
a
majority
who's
growing
a
--
over
half
of
the
volume
at
any
time
the
marketing
program
displeases
them.
if
the
local
group
there
in
florida
does
not
want
a
shipping
regulation
such
as
was
argued
here,
they
need
not
make
a
recommendation
and
there
would
be
no
regulation.
now,
it
seems
possible
that
if
a
local
industry
group
wished
to
strike
down
a
state
law
that
they
did
not
like,
that
the
technique
for
them
to
do
would
be
to
form
a
marketing
order
and
issue
some
kind
of
a
regulation
controlling
the
flow
of
their
commodity
in
market.
now,
it
maybe
a
high
regulation
or
low
regulation
presumably
to
maximize
returns,
it
would
be
a
low
regulation
and
if
the
position
of
handlers
is
correct
here,
any
regulation
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture,
the
recommendation
of
this
local
committee
would
preempt
the
field
of
regulations.
and
not
necessarily
then
would
there
be
any
protection
for
the
consumer
and
we
do
not
imagine
that
congress
had
intended
that
this
type
of
self-help
regulation
would
be
utilized
to
strike
down
state
statutes
which
are
otherwise
within
the
state
police
power.
in
the
closing
--
mr.
john
fourt
on
this
record
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
mr.
justice
goldberg.
if
the
factual
situation
were
as
you
say
that
avocados
were
completely
excluded,
we'd
say
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
john
fourt
west
indian
varieties,
yes.
mr.
john
fourt
first,
that
are
--
it's
not
the
facts
here.
secondly,
that
would
pose
a
different
question.
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
because
--
mr.
john
fourt
no,
i
think
that's
correct,
but
if
our
state
laws
intended
to
protect
consumers
of
such
light
moment
that
the
court
is
going
to
strike
them
down
on
a
hypothetical
situation.
let's
wait
until
they
do
ship
them
out
by
airplane.
it's
unlikely
and
therefore
we
think
the
court
should
reach
that
question
when
it
comes
up.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
again,
a
different
question
would
be
presented.
we
do
not
know
on
this
record
what
the
oil
content
is
of
these
west
indian
varieties.
there
is
a
vague
intimations
that
they
have
low
oil
content
and
that
at
such
low
oil
contents,
they're
mature,
but
this
record
is
unsatisfactory
and
on
this
record,
the
situation
is
hypothetical.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
both
because
of
that
and
because
of
the
testimony
of
the
one
witness
was
very
unsatisfactory
and
found
not
to
be
convincing
by
the
district
court.
mr.
john
fourt
we
do
not
--
on
this
record,
we
do
not
know
whether
the
west
indian
varieties
would
be
mature
at
less
than
8%.
if
that
were
shown
to
be
the
fact,
then
a
different
question,
a
more
serious
question
would
be
presented.
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
if
the
west
indian
varieties
are
mature.
mr.
john
fourt
in
--
mr.
john
fourt
the
purple
and
black
in
florida
is
a
very
large
fruit.
yes,
and
those
are
western
--
mr.
john
fourt
yes,
those
are
west
indian
varieties.
if
the
answer
is
that
if
the
--
those
varieties
were
mature,
then
obviously
the
consumer
is
protected
--
mr.
john
fourt
sir?
mr.
john
fourt
yes.
no.
mr.
john
fourt
we
think
that
this
is
a
possibility
because
it
is
controlled
by
the
local
industry.
mr.
john
fourt
granted
that
they
need
--
that
might
be
the
case
but
--
mr.
john
fourt
i
think
this
is
the
danger.
the
state
law
is
fixed.
it
cannot
be
amended
except
by
the
legislature.
these
regulations
can
be
amended
in
48
hours
notice
by
the
recommendation
of
the
local
committee
and
it's
been
said
that
there's
nothing
that
ripens
on
avocados
like
an
f.o.b.
cash
ready.
in
closing,
we
would
like
to
point
out
that
there
has
been
no
intervention
in
this
case
and
no
objection
made
by
the
secretary
of
agriculture
that
the
california
statute
has
in
any
way
frustrated
the
objectives
of
the
california
--
of
the
federal
marketing
act
of
1936
--
1937.
thank
you.
