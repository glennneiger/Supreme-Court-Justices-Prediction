justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
interview
report.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
what
we
call
it,
was
it
in
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
campbell
was
here,
we
called
it
the
interview
report.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it's
the
one
that's
in
the
footnote?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no.
but
in
this
particular
case
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
are
you
talking
about
that
report
which
we
said
out
verbatim
in
the
footnote
in
campbell?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
get
to
this
question
mr.
louison,
if
in
fact
judge
wyzanski
was
right
that
the
interview
report
was
producible
either
as
a
statement
under
(e)
(1)
or
(e)
(2),
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
mean,
do
we
get
to
the
question
of
the
destruction
and
consequences
of
the
destruction
of
the
fbi
agent's
original
notes
if
in
fact
judge
wyzanski
was
right
but
you
were
entitled
to
the
interview
report
as
a
statement
under
(e)
(1)
or
(e)
(2)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
are
you
then
suggesting
that
even
though
you
are
entitled
to
the
report
and
not
having
had
it
therefore
that
there
must
be
a
new
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
this
--
has
--
now
to
be
decided
also
whether
staula
is
not
to
testify
because
the
agent's
original
notes
were
destroyed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
now
judge
wyzanski
didn't
quite
make
that
finding,
did
he?
i'm
looking
at
page
131,
finding
three.
toomey
did
not
purport
to
read
the
jottings
on
the
pad
and
just
the
order
they
appeared.
and
although
the
script
was
carried
that
once
article,
it
would
lead
back
to
another.
yet,
toomey
not
merely
adhered
to
the
substance
but
so
far
as
practical
to
the
precise
words.
is
that
the
same
thing
you're
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
was
just
wondering,
mr.
louison,
we
do
have
findings,
six
of
them.
judge
wyzanski
based
on
all
of
the
evidence
of
the
merits.
are
we
to
go
back
to
those?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
apparently,
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
think
it
might,
but
is
there
a
question
here
in
how
far
even
the
court
of
appeals
or
indeed
we
may
go
back
to
those
findings?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what's
your
position?
we
should
or
should
not
go
back?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
neither
the
court
of
appeals
should
nor
should
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
so,
then
it
doesn't
really
help
to
go
back
into
the
testimony,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
a
--
after
--
i
take
it
in
the
sense,
these
are
findings
of
what
we
come
to
call
historical
facts,
what
happened
in
exactly
the
way
it
was
done?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
taking
of
the
interview
report?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
if
they're
supported
by
evidence,
should
we
go
behind
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
much
of
the
proceedings
before
judge
mccarthy
are
now
relevant
to
any
question
we
have
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
fact
that
on
the
question
whether
--
on
the
questions
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
have
brought
here
namely
whether
--
this
indeed
was
a
statement
producible
under
(e)
(1)
or
(e)
(2),
and
secondly,
the
consequences
of
the
destruction
of
the
original
notes.
do
we
have
to
go
back
of
what
judge
wyzanski
did
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
as
i
have
stated
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
seemed
to
have
sent
this
back
to
judge
wyzanski
almost
just
as
a
master
to
make
these
findings
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
submit
a
master's
report
or
something
like
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
having
--
but
we
have
to
go
through
all
these
in
every
jencks
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
that
it
was
used
in
the
sense
of
counterpart.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
don't
think
that
in
the
opinion
copy
was
used
in
the
sense
of
counterpart?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
mr.
o'donnell,
i
thought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you're
behind
what
judge
wyzanski
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
thought
he
introduced
jottings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
why
blame
the
government?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
don't
--
if
what
you're
going
to
end
up
with
is
that
there's
something
relevant
in
what
happened
before
judge
mccarthy
that
the
issues
now
before
us,
the
decision,
i
must
confess
i
had
considerable
trouble
because
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
judge
mccarthy
had
a
committed
view
and
sent
the
matter
back
to
judge
wyzanski
and
i
must
say
i
read
that
as
meaning
in
effect
that
they
wipe
the
slate
clean
and
had
judge
wyzanksi
do
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that's
so,
if
that's
so
then
there's
going
to
be
a
question
here
whether
it
was
compliance
with
our
mandate.
are
we
going
have
to
do
this
all
over
again?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
hope
not.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i'd
say
there
was
no
--
on
the
court
of
appeals'
own
analysis
of
what
happened
before
judge
mccarthy,
judge
mccarthy
didn't
do
the
job
that
we
sent
the
case
back
to
have
it
done.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
it
did
then
i
must
say
i
have
still
greater
trouble.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
instead
he
had
a
committed
view
if
that
doesn't
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
(voice
overlap)
just
reject
them.
i
don't
know
what
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
what
authority
did
it
have
to
make
the
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
--
what
if
we
already
--
that
it
have
under
our
mandate
to
make
findings
independently.
we
sent
it
back
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
to
the
district
court
for
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
hope.
