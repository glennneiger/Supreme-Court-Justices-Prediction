mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
in
the
beginning
to
recall
very
briefly
the
sequence
of
events
in
this
case
also
perhaps
most
of
the
court
has
it
in
mind.
the
robbery
occurred
back
in
1957
and
of
course,
these
interviews
with
the
witness
were
conducted
before
the
jencks
act
had
been
passed
and
just
after
the
jencks
decision
had
been
handed
out.
the
trial
was
held
as
there
as
i
can
make
out
from
the
record
some
time
in
the
spring
of
1958,
that's
five
years
ago.
then
the
case
--
there
was
a
conviction.
the
case
came
up
to
this
court
on
certiorari
from
the
affirmance
of
the
conviction
and
it
was
held
that
there
had
been
an
error
in
the
procedure
or
perhaps
i
should
say
in
the
substance,
in
any
event
an
error
with
respect
to
the
handling
of
the
jencks
act
question,
both
because
the
judge
failed
to
call
agent
toomey
to
find
out
whether
the
writing
that
staula
referred
to
had
ever
been
adopted
and
approved
by
staula
because
he
hadn't
perhaps
inquired
sufficiently
into
what
had
happened
to
the
writing
as
it
was
described
by
staula,
and
because
the
judge
had
more
of
an
affirmative
duty
to
inquire
into
the
existence
of
valid
impeaching
material.
the
case
then
went
back
and
there
was
a
hearing
before
judge
mccarthy
upon
the
questions
that
this
court
had
formulated
in
the
course
of
its
opinion
and
judge
mccarthy
heard
toomey,
the
fbi
agent
who'd
taken
the
--
made
the
report
at
some
length.
and
that
the
conclusion
of
that
hearing,
judge
mccarthy
made
very
clear
findings
of
fact
in
which
he
found
that
this
was
not
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
of
an
oral
statement
made
by
staula
to
toomey,
and
he
found
that
the
notes
had
not
been
adopted
or
approved
by
staula.
then
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
two
things.
first
it
said
that
reviewing
the
records
for
itself,
because
he
thought
that
judge
mccarthy
had
a
committed
view
on
this,
that
if
found,
as
a
fact,
that
this
was
not
a
qualified
statement
under
(e)
(2),
that
it
was
not
a
substantially
verbatim
recital.
and
it
sent
the
matter
back
to
a
new
judge
who
by
lot
became
judge
wyzanski
to
determine
a
single
question
and
that
was
because
staula,
who
haven't
been
called
and
to
have
him
testify
and
toomey
testified
again
upon
the
single
question
of
whether
staula
had
adopted
and
approved
the
notes
as
his
statement.
judge
wyzanski,
then
took
testimony
and
instead
of
confining
himself
to
the
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
have
put
before
him,
he
went
out
of
his
way
and
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
him
and
apparently
disregarding
all
the
evidence
before
judge
mccarthy
which
had
been
submitted
when
that
issue
was
the
one
in
the
district
court.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
submit
--
i
submit
not
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
should
think
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't.
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
just
where
the
--
your
honor,
suggest
there
was
failure
to
comply.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
court
felt
that
he
had
properly
done
all
but
one
part
of
it.
the
court
said
so
in
its
opinion,
mr.
justice
brennan,
if
i
read
it
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
sent
it
back
because
the
matter
of
adopted
or
approved
had
not
been
properly
resolved
before
judge
mccarthy.
now,
i
think,
that
perhaps
i
have
given
an
impression
that
i
--
it
was
not
a
100%
accurate
although
i
think
it
stated
it
right.
it
is
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
regard
itself
as
bound
by
judge
mccarthy's
findings.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
but
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
and
for
that
reason.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
the
--
it's
beyond
that
point
that
we're
different.
the
court
then
went
and
said
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
it
would
make
the
finding
that
that
point
had
been
thoroughly
investigated.
the
question
whether
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it
found
that
the
record
was
--
the
records
were
all
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
record
would
permit
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
take
it
if
the
record
would
permit
only
one
finding
that
that
would
be
entirely
a
problem.
if
there
could
be
no
difference
based
on
what
a
reasonable
man
might
find
based
on
the
witnesses
and
so
forth
then
it
was
proper
to
go
ahead.
now,
i
was
relating
this
not
to
argue
that
judge
wyzanski's
views
under
(e)
(2)
were
irrelevant
because
i
don't
think
i'm
entitled
to
do
that.
i
think
he
did
go
outside
its
structure.
i
am
relating
it
because
i
do
think
that
--
well,
barely
several
things,
i
think
that
the
whole
record
is
before
this
court,
both
the
testimony
taken
before
judge
mccarthy
and
the
testimony
taken
before
judge
wyzanski.
i
think
that
the
--
that
second
--
that
interpreted
--
that
in
interpreting
judge
wyzanski's
finding
and
in
resolving
the
contradictions
between
them,
there
is
no
escape
from
going
back
to
the
facts
and
i
think
third,
that
if
judge
wyzanski's
findings,
which
of
course
like
all
findings
are
open
to
some
interpretation,
are
interpreted
in
one
way,
if
--
when
he
finds
that
the
two
accounts
given
by
the
agent
were
in
ipsissima
verba,
he
really
means
that
they
were
in
ipsissima
verba
then
we
respectfully
submit
that
his
findings
are
clearly
contrary
to
the
evidence.
so
that
i
do
say
no
escape
from
a
considerable
consideration
of
the
evidence
at
both
hearings
and
it
was
really
that
point
as
well
as
recalling
when
it
happened
that
i
was
attempting
to
lead
up
to.
the
actual
issue
in
this
case
is
very
narrowly
confined.
the
government's
duty
with
respect
to
statements
is
laid
down
in
the
jencks
act.
the
only
contention
that
has
been
made
here
is
that
the
testament
was
producible
under
the
jencks
act
and
we
have
as
a
starting
point
in
this
case
the
interpretation
could
have
found
the
jencks
act
by
this
court,
in
the
palermo
case
where
the
court
held
that
although
(e)
(2)
particularly
does
go
beyond,
somewhat
beyond
mechanical
or
stenographic
statement
still
thereafter
the
statute
is
to
be
construed
most
narrowly.
and
the
court
attempting
to
indicate
of
what
it
thought
was
the
proper
formulas
in,
it
is
clear
that
congress
was
concerned
that
only
those
statements
which
could
properly
be
called
the
witness'
own
words
should
be
made
available
to
defense
for
--
purposes
of
impeachment.
summaries
of
an
oral
statement
which
evidence
--
substantial
selection
of
material
or
which
were
prepared
after
the
interview
without
the
aid
of
complete
notes
and
hence
rest
upon
the
memory
of
the
agent
are
not
to
be
produced.
now,
our
argument
is
that,
under
the
palermo
case,
under
the
words
of
the
statute
and
under
the
sense
of
fairness
of
the
problem
which
i'm
going
to
try
to
attempt
to
develop.
neither,
the
interview
report
by
which
i
mean,
the
same
as
you
mr.
justice
brennan,
the
agent's
signed
report,
nor
what
i
shall
call
them
notes,
the
thing
he
wrote
down
during
the
interview
is
producible
under
the
jencks
act.
i
do
think
also,
it's
not
in
the
record,
that
it
maybe
helpful
before
i
come
to
those
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
general
practice
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
fbi
in
taking
these
interviews.
and
i
will
try
to
distinguish
between
today
as
a
result
of
the
jencks
act
and
the
jencks
decision
in
our
experience
and
what
was
done
earlier,
also
really
there's
very
little
difference.
an
agent
maybe
sent
out
or
maybe
sent
out
and
may
choose
to
do
either
of
two
things,
if
he
thinks
a
man
is
what
is
called
a
key
witness,
one
who
can
give
a
substantial
account
of
whatever
it
is
he's
investigating
then
he
is
told
to
get
a
statement.
and
by
a
statement,
he
means
the
witness'
own
words
as
to
what
occurred
or
preferably
signed
although
as
we
all
know,
you
can't
always
get
a
man
to
sign
something
even
though
you
will
say
it
was
his
statement.
if
he
does
not
think
the
man
is
unimportant
or
if
you
can't
get
him
for
one
reason
or
another
to
make
a
statement,
then
he
is
instructed
to
prepare
a
written
report
that
is
a
complete
and
accurate
account
of
the
information
that
he
got
from
him.
the
first
is
the
witness'
statement.
by
statement,
they
mean,
i
think
something
like
justice
goldberg
was
suggesting
earlier
or
something
the
witness,
i
said
or
that
something
the
witness
--
in
his
words.
on
the
other
hand,
the
report
involves
selectivity
of
the
agent's
judgment
of
what
was
the
important
information.
now,
all
statements
have
always
been
kept
and
this
of
course
has
always
been
kept
by
the
fbi.
in
the
--
today,
and
this
was
simply
because
they
were
supposed
to
be
important
and
people
knew
that
they
might
be
used
in
court
either
for
the
government
or
against
the
government
and
for
that
reason,
they
were
preserved.
today,
they
are
preserved,
of
course,
because
of
the
jencks
act
and
because
we
now
know
that's
there's
an
obligation
to
have
them
and
to
turn
them
over.
in
addition
as
i
understand
it,
it's
not
relevant
i
think
to
this
case
because
your
honors
may
have
the
whole
picture,
as
i
understand
it,
the
instructions
today
are
also
to
keep
anything
that
the
agent
regards
as
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
even
though
it
isn't
a
statement
in
the
technical
sense.
now,
i'm
not
--
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
statement
of
mine
is
relevant
in
judging
what
the
agent
did
here.
there
were
no
so
such
instructions
back
in
1957.
the
agent's
notes
are
taken
and
his
instructions
apparently
are,
don't
try
to
write
the
whole
thing,
write
down
enough
to
remember
and
then
you
go
back
and
you
make
a
narrative
report,
which
is
an
accurate
statement
of
the
information
you've
got
and
which
does
involve
memory,
selectivity,
emphasis
and
the
like.
at
that
stage,
the
practice
has
always
been
to
allow
the
agent
and
possibly
even
to
encourage
the
agent
to
throw
away
the
notes.
i
inquired
why
are
the
notes
thrown
away?
why
don't
we
keep
them?
and
the
answer
i
got
was,
“well,
they've
served
the
purpose.
it's
just
as
if
you
call
me
up
and
asked
me
to
get
you
certain
things
to
prepare
your
argument
but
once
i've
come
and
seen
you,
then
i
throw
the
notes
away.”
they
are
made
for
the
purpose
of
preparing
this
report.
and
there's
nothing
as
one
of
the
fbi
agent
said
to
me,
“if
the
court
says,
“we
have
to
keep
them,
we'll
keep
them.”
but
there
didn't
seem
to
be
any
purpose
of
it
up
to
this
point
and
that
is
what
happened
in
this
particular
case.
the
notes
were
destroyed
as
the
agent
testified
when
they
had
served
its
particular
purpose.
now
i
come
specifically
to
the
statute
and
to
the
particular
issues
here.
and
i'm
going
to
talk
first
about
the
interview
report
because
the
interview
report
is
available,
was
available
at
the
trial.
the
essential
facts
i
have
already
indicated,
there
was
this
interview
and
the
agent
somewhere
from
six
to
seven
to
nine
hours
later
went
back
and
dictated
this
report
using
his
notes
for
that
purpose.
it
seems
to
us
plain,
first
from
the
words
of
the
statute
that
the
interview
report
does
not
qualify
for
a
production.
certainly,
it
does
not
qualify
under
section
--
subdivision
(e)
(1),
the
statutes
on
pages
2
and
3
of
our
brief.
it
is
not
the
writing
of
the
interview
report,
plainly
was
never
adopted
or
approved
by
the
witness
and
certainly,
it
wasn't
signed
by
the
witness.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
wasn't
made
by
him.
it
wasn't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that
--
if
it
is
a
copy
of
the
notes.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
must
disagree
with
your
honor
on
the
statement.
he
read
the
notes
back
to
witness.
he
did
not
--
and
he
testified
that
he
did
not
read
the
notes
back
to
the
witness.
mr.
archibald
cox
having
the
notes
in
front
of
him,
he
may
gave
what
he
called
a
narrative
account
of
what
the
witness
had
said
and
he
gave
an
illustration
that
i
will
develop
after
the
luncheon
recess,
mr.
chief
justice
which
--
in
order
to
illustrate
what
he
did,
that
judge
wyzanski
and
i
think
it
was
very
useful,
asked
him
--
what
i'll
show
you
--
show
me
what
you
did
and
take
your
interview
report
as
a
basis
and
he
did
it.
and
if
you
will
compare
the
transcript
of
what
he
said
with
the
interview
report
as
it's
printed
in
the
first
record
and
in
the
opinion,
the
first
opinion
in
the
campbell
case,
you
will
find
as
i
say,
i
will
point
out
a
little
later
in
my
argument,
at
least
four
very
significant
differences
that
any
cross-examiner
could
exploit
and
make
a
great
deal
of
and
the
gist
of
our
case
is
exploiting
and
making
a
great
deal
of
differences
that
are
attributable
to
the
agent
and
not
to
the
witness
is
not
conducive
to
the
fair
administration
of
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
in
my
anxiety
to
point
out,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
a
point
that
i
will
develop
at
more
length
later
when
i
come
directly
to
deal
with
the
notes
as
distinguished
in
the
interview
report,
in
my
anxiety
to
point
out
that
in
our
view,
that
notes
were
not
read
back,
and
indeed,
i
think
no
one
found
that
the
notes
were
read
back
as
such.
i
perhaps
didn't
address
myself
to
what
was
earlier
stressed
of
your
question.
if
one
had
a
case,
which
we
say
we
do
not,
in
which
notes
have
been
made
and
read
back
and
then
a
real
true
copy
of
the
notes
existed
and
the
notes
for
some
reason
were
unavailable,
if
it
was
as
i
say
a
real
true
copy
or
what
i
understand
a
counterpart
of
the
exact
copy
then
i
think
we
would
agree
that
the
counterpart
of
the
notes
that
were
approved
by
the
witness
would
be
producible
under
the
statute.
but
certainly,
i
can
make
that
--
make
that,
i
can
say
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
and
if
that
was
the
substantive
question
you
were
getting
at,
the
answer
is
the
one
i've
just
given.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
one
--
i'll
address
myself
with
that
right
now.
i
think
one
has
to
distinguish
between
several
situations.
in
the
first
place,
this
happily,
normally
comes
up
in
the
context
of
the
trial.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
today,
some
of
the
immediate
reaction
to
the
jencks
decision
had
calmed
down.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
today,
i
am
told
to
the
united
states
attorneys
in
the
great
bulk
of
cases
turn
over
these
things.
if
someone
were
to
say
to
me,
why
didn't
they
turn
it
over
here?
i'm
not
sure
that
if
i've
been
there,
i
wouldn't
have
turned
it
over
here.
i
think
there
were
very
good
reasons
not
to
that
i
am
going
to
develop
but
maybe
there
are
on
the
side
of
doing
it
to
avoid
this
question.
i
don't
mean
to
imply
it.
i
think
it
should've
been
done.
i
think
one
could've
avoided
the
question.
now,
if
under
those
circumstances,
the
trial
judge
makes
his
ruling
about
the
conduct
of
the
trial,
i
would
think
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
in
palermo
and
elsewhere
that
there
is
the
--
very
greatest
presumption
of
every
kind
in
favor
of
interpreting
his
findings
in
favor
of
what
he
has
done,
in
terms
of
finding
that
the
evidence
as
part
of
those
findings.
we
don't
have
that
kind
of
case.
we've
got
i
think
an
extraordinary
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
felt
very
sure
it
is,
justice
brennan.
it's
--
we've
had
these
series
of
things
happening
in
it
which
sort
of
taken
out
in
the
pattern
that
your
honor
has
described
it.
and
here,
for
the
reasons
i've
tried
to
indicate
before
and
partly
because
we
do
say
it.
i
don't
think
the
court
can
ever
escape
this
responsibility.
we
do
say
that
judge
wyzanski's
findings,
if
interpreted
most
strongly
against
it,
simply
are
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
and
we
do
say
second,
that
to
confine
your
honors'
examination
of
the
evidence,
simply
to
the
hearing
before
judge
wyzanski,
it
would
be
unfair
both
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
the
administration
of
justice
because
we
thought
we've
tried
(e)
(2)
out
before
judge
mccarthy
and
we
had
a
definitive
ruling
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
that.
now,
to
resolve
(e)
(2),
without
regard
to
that
evidence,
it
seems
to
me
an
injustice.
so
while
again,
i
think
the
weight
must
be
given,
of
course,
to
what
the
district
judges
did.
still,
i
think
there's
no
escape
from
looking
back
to
seeing
what
the
effects
were.
i
don't
think
there's
much
question
about
what
the
facts
were
here
as
--
mr.
archibald
cox
as
to
whether
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
thought
it
sent
it
back
to
judge
wyzanski
to
see
whether
the
notes
had
been
read
back
and
approved.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
that
wouldn't
make
the
interview
report
producible
under
(e)
(1)
unless
there
was
testimony
showing
that
the
interview
report
was
truly
a
copy
of
the
notes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
did
he
really?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
he
did
really
find
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
says
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
also
--
yes,
of
course,
we
also
have
a
finding
back
on
page
131
where
he
says,
toomey
did
not
purport
to
read
the
jottings
on
the
pad,
just
the
order
they
appeared
with
the
scrupulous
care
that
one
stenographer
would
read
back
to
another.
and
you
take
the
witness'
--
you
take
the
witness'
own
description
of
what
he
did
and
it's
quite
clear
that
he
didn't
read
the
statements
back.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
prob
--
yes.
that
was
sent
back
--
mr.
archibald
cox
this
issue
was
sent
back
to
judge
wyzanski,
yes.
and
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
on
the
other
hand,
to
say
that
the
interview
report
is
not
the
faithful
reproduction
of
what
was
read
to
the
witness,
surely,
then
it
can't
qualify
under
(e)
(1)
because
in
that
event,
it
wouldn't
be
a
copy
--
mr.
archibald
cox
whether
it
was
a
copy
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
no,
no
that
was
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
he
did
get
to
that
issue
and
made
findings
upon
it.
now,
there
is
one
other
point
about
(e)
(1)
that
i
should
emphasize
and
that
is
that
neither
judge
wyzanski,
i
don't
think
judge
wyzanski
found
that
staula
adopted
or
approved
but
the
agent
said
to
him
as
his
statement.
it
is
true
that
staula
said
and
there's
really
no
dispute
about
this,
that's
what
happened
or
that's
true.
nobody
seems
to
recall
exactly
what
he
said.
i
submit
that
that
--
that
saying,
“yes,
you've
got
it
right,
you
understand
the
facts”,
is
something
quite
different
from
adopting
or
approving
something
as
your
statement
and
we
rely
on
that
point
under
(e)
(1)
as
well
as
the
others.
now,
i
come
to
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
think
--
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
theory
of
the
statute
and
the
sound
theory
of
the
statute
is
that
they
should
not
be
interjected
in
a
trial.
a
subsequent
dispute
about
whether
these
ever
were
the
witness'
words
or
how
far
did
the
fbi
agent
distort
the
witness'
words.
that's
--
remember
we're
back
to
the
question
as
whether
these
men
robbed
the
bank.
any
impeaching
statement
even
when
it's
admittedly
the
witness'
own
statement
is
to
a
degree
collateral,
to
introduce
the
still
further
question
is
the
statement
attributed
to
him
really
his
statement
at
all.
and
if
not,
how
far
did
the
agent
distort
or
change
it,
is
i
submit,
an
undesirable
and
the
improper
inquiry
for
a
number
of
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
it's
unfair
to
the
witness.
as
justice
brennan
said
in
the
jencks
case
itself
that
frequently
small
to
get
his
exact
words.
the
omission
from
the
report
or
facts
related
at
the
trial
or
contrast
and
emphasis
upon
the
same
thing
or
even
a
different
order
of
treatment
are
also
relevant
to
the
cross-examining
process.
now,
that
is
certainly
fair
and
proper
where
the
difference
in
the
order
of
treatment
or
where
the
omission,
where
the
contrast
and
emphasis
are
the
result
of
the
witness'
own
doing,
but
where
they
result
from
what
somebody
else
has
done
--
said
your
honor,
from
a
defect
in
his
memory,
from
his
selections
because
of
his
attempt
to
decide
what's
important
or
whether
it's
simply
that
forgetfulness.
then
i
think
that
it
is
unfair
that
the
witness
be
taxed
with
it.
it's
unfair
to
the
witness.
in
the
second
place,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
may
shake
the
witness'
confidence
in
what
he
said,
quite
unfair
if
he's
confronted
with
the
paper
that
purports
to
say
what
he
said,
“didn't
you
say
this?”
the
fbi
agent
has
it
written
down.
now,
even
so
he
is
very
sure
that
he
didn't
say
it,
he'll
begin
to
wonder.
i
think
in
this
connection
of
a
quite
different
incident,
here
in
court,
perhaps
a
month
or
so
ago
when
one
of
the
justices
suggested
through
some
aberration
in
his
recollection
that
a
private
party
couldn't
sue
for
an
injunction
to
restrain
violations
of
the
sherman
act.
i
don't
know
how
many
people
reacted
as
i
did
but
mine
was,
well,
i
always
suppose
we
could.
i
thought
it
was
perfectly
clear.
but
if
he
said
so,
you
have
confidence
in
what
he
said
and
he
said
it
with
confidence
and
you
begin
to
wonder.
now,
if
it
was
your
own
words,
well
and
good.
but
if
it's
something
that
some
agent
has
put
down
not
trying
to
get
your
word,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
witness
shouldn't
be
so
shaken.
mr.
archibald
cox
my
third
reason
mr.
justice,
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
you're
thinking
that
this
is
a
question
that
must
be
decided
in
advance
is
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
i
think
it
is
a
distraction
of
the
jury
from
the
central
issue.
this
is
always
a
question
in
a
long
trial.
and
finally
--
well,
i
don't
want
to
overstress
the
point
because
certainly
the
government
will
adopt
itself
if
it
has
to,
to
circumscribe
the
way
agents
must
act
is
to
some
degree
are
going
to
curtail
them
as
the
court
of
appeals
pointed
out
on
the
--
in
its
first
opinion,
to
some
degree
going
to
interfere
was
the
investigative
process.
i'm
not
making
great
deal
of
this,
but
if
the
agent
can
take
notes
on
the
--
to
get
the
information,
the
substance
of
the
information
and
forget
any
danger
that
it
will
ever
be
used
in
an
effort
to
impeach
a
witness
later,
he
can
carry
on
his
job
quite
differently
then
if
he
has
to
be
told.
now,
remember,
any
report
even
of
the
substance
of
what
the
witness
said
to
you
is
subject
to
being
used
to
impeach
him
and
therefore
you
always
must
take
a
statement
of
the
witness
what
the
instruction
would
be
and
this
would
simply
be
a
narrowing
into
that
degree
and
interference.
so
i
think
those
five
reasons
suggest
that
this
ordinarily
must
be
determined
in
advance.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
your
honor,
i
had
--
have
two
difficulties
with
all
respect
with
your
statement.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
first
is
the
witness
didn't
say
here,
“that's
what
i
said.”
indeed
--
mr.
archibald
cox
he
said,
“that's
what
happened.
that's
true”,
or
something
like
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
nobody
seems
very
sure.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
let
me
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
suggest
once
again
and
i
don't
want
to
forget
the
second
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
the
point
of
your
honor.
they've
--
but
let
me
suggest
once
again
that
just
as
justice
brennan
have
pointed
out
in
the
jencks
case,
the
differences
in
emphasis,
changes
in
sequence,
omission
of
something
or
maybe
exploited
by
a
skillful
cross-examiner
so
there
is
a
difference
between
taking
and
verifying
a
statement
as
your
statement
and
saying,
“yes,
you've
got
an
accurate
picture
of
what
occurred.
”i
think
those
are
two
very
different
things.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
congress
made
it
very
clear
in
the
legislative
history
that
it
didn't
want
the
omissions,
the
changes
in
sequence,
the
differences
in
emphasis
used
as
a
basis
for
cross-examination.
now,
the
other
thing
that
--
if
i
may
go
on
just
a
minute,
mr.
justice
white,
the
other
thing
that
troubles
me
mr.
chief
justice
in
your
statement
perhaps
i'm
taking
it
too
literally,
i
don't
think
the
agents
deliberately
avoid
getting
statements.
i
have
nothing
in
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
--
i
don't
think
there'd
be
any
consequences
at
all.
i
think
the
agents
as
i've
told
in
the
case
of
important
witnesses
to
get
statements
because
i
think
they
basically
tried
to
get
statements.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
was
i,
your
honor.
and
i
asked
this
question.
i
couldn't
ask
it
of
toomey
because
i
don't
know
where
toomey
is
but
i
asked
the
men
who
were
familiar
with
this
question.
and
they
replied,
“well,
we
all
make
our
judgments
as
to
what
likely
to
have
happened?”
we
all
have
our
theory
as
what's
important
here
and
toomey
apparently
didn't
think
this
was
such
man.
in
retrospect
--
in
retrospect
they
said
and
i
said
it.
it
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
there's
a
very
--
i
think
there's
a
very
good
illustration
of
exactly
the
danger
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
that
was
what
happened,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
i
think
it's
important
to
see
exactly
what
happened
because
this
does
illustrate
curiously
the
very
--
one
of
the
very
things
that
i
have
been
trying
to
emphasize.
now,
let's
get
the
facts
here
straight.
the
petitioners
say
in
their
brief
and
this
is
no
doubt
what
your
honor
relied
on,
staula
told
agent
toomey
that
he
saw
only
two
people
in
the
bank
and
never
saw
a
third
robber.
this
is
diametrically
opposed
to
his
identification
of
three
men
at
the
trial.
now,
the
fact
is
that
he
did
not
identify
three
men
at
the
trial
and
the
record
makes
it
perfectly
plain
that
he
didn't
identify
three
men
at
the
trial.
what
he
did
do
was
he
said
there
were
three
men
in
the
bank.
and
he
explained
that
the
reason
there
were
--
he
knew
there
were
three,
was
he
could
see
two
of
them
and
he
heard
another
voice
who
was
obviously
one
of
the
group.
so
he
knew
there
was
a
third
man
there
and
he
explained
this
at
the
trial.
now,
his
statement
which
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
let's
look
--
because
your
honor,
either
the
first
record
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
or
the
full
text
to
the
court's
opinion
in
the
first
campbell
case.
the
statement
is
just
below
the
description
of
the
robber
with
a
dark
blue
suit
with
a
dark
hat
on.
there
the
statement
appears,
mr.
staula
stated
that
he
did
not
observe
a
third
man
in
the
bank.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
is
on
page
213
of
the
first
record.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
also
--
mr.
justice
brennan
gave
the
page
but
i
didn't
get
--
mr.
archibald
cox
page
91
of
365
u.s.
now,
let's
go
back
to
the
interview.
the
agent,
knowing
that
there
was
three
men
and
remember
that
he
had
interviewed
other
people,
who
might
very
well
have
said,
this
was
apparently
done
over
a
full
half
hour
and
he
was
asking
questions.
“can
you
describe
the
third
robber?”
and
the
witness
might
say
no.
“well,
why
not?”
he
might
have
replied,
“i
didn't
get
a
chance
to
observe
him.”
he
might
have
said,
as
the
agent
said
he
said
on
page
115,
that
he
did
not
observe
the
third
man
standing
in
the
back.
in
other
words,
he
knew
he
was
there
but
he
didn't
observe
it
so
that
he
could
describe
him.
now,
i
can't
say
that
that
happened.
that
wouldn't
be
so
fully,
but
i
do
think
to
have
the
witness
cross-examined
when
the
word
observe
wasn't
his
word
and
when
the
--
we
don't
know
what
words
he
used
to
the
agent
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
let
me
--
may
i,
while
i'm
at
it
and
while
we
have
these
pages
in
front
of
us,
point
out
the
kind
of
differences
that
creep
in.
now
to
illustrate
to
judge
wyzanski
what
he
did
with
respect
to
the
notes,
he
took
the
statement
that's
reprinted
in
365
u.s.,
the
one
on
page
213
of
the
first
record
that
he
held
it
in
front
of
him
as
if
it
was
his
notes.
and
then
he
gave
what
he
called
a
narrative
account
such
as
he
gave
to
the
witness.
and
taking
just
the
two
paragraphs
that
they
--
as
they
appear
at
page
115
of
the
present
record,
let
me
point
out
some
four
differences,
there
are
others
but
let
me
point
out
four
that
seemed
to
me
of
--
perhaps
not
of
significance
in
cross-examining
this
witness,
but
they
show
the
kind
of
thing
that
it
could
be
different.
in
the
first
place,
in
the
statement
as
it
was
written
up,
it
says,
he
did
not
know
--
he
did
not
know
what
type
of
gun
was
carried
by
these
two
individuals
whom
he
observed
but
believed
that
they
could've
been
45
caliber
automatics.
as
he
put
it
to
judge
wyzanski,
you
were
not
certain
what
kind
of
guns
they
are
but
you
feel
they
are
45
caliber
automatic.
now,
i
suggest
your
honor,
justice
brennan,
could
do
quite
a
lot
with
that
on
cross-examination
as
to
the
difference
in
the
degree
of
the
witness'
recollection,
which
time
was
it
right,
which
time
was
it
wrong.
again,
he
tells
it
quite
differently
with
respect
to
the
chance
to
observe
the
robbers.
the
one
that
is
written
down,
the
agent's
report
says,
that
after
facing
the
wall,
staula
observed
these
individuals
no
further.
i
may
say
that
the
“observe”
seems
to
me
almost
surely
to
be
the
agent's
word.
it
comes
in
over
and
over
again
and
staula
didn't
use
it
himself
during
his
prime,
the
word
observe,
although,
he
answered
questions
with
observed.
now,
the
other
time
in
the
one
of
the
trial,
there's
no
such
assertion
at
all.
there's
no
statement
as
to
whether
he
had
a
chance
to
observe
them
further
or
not.
another
difference
with
respect
to
the
opportunities
and
observation,
in
the
agent's
report,
he
has
staula
saying
that
he
entered
the
vault
as
directed
and
observed
these
individuals
no
further.
in
court,
the
agent
says
that
what
he
read
back
would
have
been,
one
of
the
men
ordered
you
to
go
into
the
vault
and
as
you
got
there,
you
saw
these
individuals.
now,
again,
let
me
know
the
qualification.
the
next
line
says,
you
saw
them
no
further
and
it
maybe
that
the
agent
started
to
make
a
mistake
and
that
the
stenographer
was
not
able
to
catch
the
intonation.
but
even
the
fact,
he
started
to
make
a
mistake,
he
got
that
far
enough,
demonstrates
i
think,
the
danger
of
not
having
something
that
is
an
attempt
to
recite
the
witness'
words.
the
final
one,
there's
a
difference
with
respect
either
to
the
orders
that
were
given
them
about
entering
the
vault
or
with
respect
to
the
time
they
were
in
the
vault.
in
the
agent's
actual
interview
report
down
toward
the
end,
mr.
staula
stated
that
one
of
the
robbers
closed
the
door
of
the
vault,
he
issued
some
order
to
the
effect
that
people
locked
inside
should
not
leave
and
that
they
stayed
there
for
five
or
ten
minutes.
the
one
he
gave
at
the
trial
says,
“somebody
closed
the
door
of
the
vault
and
said
something
to
the
effect
that
people
in
there
should
not
leave
for
five
or
ten
minutes.”
there
are
two
more
--
it's
the
same
thing
but
two
more
things.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
--
i
don't
know.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
then
he
was
showing
how
he
paraphrased
from
his
notes.
mr.
archibald
cox
he's
pretending
that
the
interview
report
was
the
notes.
now,
the
reason
i
emphasize
this
because
the
interview
report
was
concededly
far
more
complete
than
the
notes.
and
if
there
were
all
these
variations
between
his
paraphrase
from
the
interview
report
and
his
paraphrase
from
the
notes,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
that
the
agent
introduced
this
kind
of
difference
shows
the
reason
for
requiring
as
(e)
(2)
does,
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
and
that
this
was
not
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
of
what
the
witness
said.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
there
is
this
variation
between
the
notes
and
what
the
agent
said
to
the
witness,
certainly
he
did
not
read
back
the
notes.
mr.
archibald
cox
one
and
two
kind
of
--
mr.
archibald
cox
and
something
could
qualify
under
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i
would
think
not.
for
example,
if
a
stenographer
here
were
taking
down
what
i
have
said.
it
would
not
qualify
under
one
if
i
never
saw
it
but
it
would
qualify
under
two.
and
it
would
qualify
under
two
even
if
the
stenographer
made
a
mistake.
and
that
go
a
step
further
if
one
who
is
able
to
write
in
longhand
rather
fast
and
i
spoke
a
little
more
slowly
than
i
sometimes
do,
was
making
an
effort
to
take
down
my
words,
then
i
would
think
that
that
might
qualify.
i
think
that's
probably
the
thing
that
justice
frankfurter
was
talking
about,
but
i
think
it
must
be
an
effort
to
take
down
what
i
was
saying.
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
wasn't
recorded
contemporaneously.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
doesn't
--
and
the
reason
for
that
of
course
is
that
if
you
--
seven
hours
later
dictate
precisely
what
you
say,
it's
the
extraordinary
chance.
it's
the
chimpanzee
typing
out
shakespeare
on
the
time
just
short
of
infinity.
the
congress
--
and
this
was
--
this,
mr.
justice
white
was
all
carefully
debated
in
congress.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
that
is
true
but
there
has
to
be
a
writing
for
him
to
approve.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
that
your
honors
took
that
last
step
in
the
first
campbell.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
oh,
no,
that
what's
judge
wyzanski
did.
that's
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
really
--
if
i
might
just
--
i
don't
think
you
took
the
last
step.
i
think
you
did
say
that
if
the
agent
attempts
to
write
down
what
--
if
the
agent
writes
something
down
and
then
reads
it
back.
and
the
witness
said,
“yes,
i
approve
that
as
my
statement.”
even
though
he
has
never
seen
it,
i
think
first
campbell
would
say
that
will
do.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
to
prove
it
as
my
statement.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
i
would
be
inclined.
i
haven't
considered
this
question,
but
my
immediate
reaction
justice
white
is
that
that
is
--
if
the
witness
really
intends
to
prove
it
as
his
that
that
is
more
nearly
(e)
(2)
than
(e)
(1).
in
other
words,
i
take
it
that
something
might
qualify
under
(e)
(2)
even
though
it's
a
question
and
answer.
and
the
bulk
of
the
questions
are
leading,
which
is
almost
the
situation
we
are
now
describing.
i
think
it
has
to
be
that
the
witness
understood
what
was
being
said
and
approved
it
as
his
but
assuming
that,
i
think
(e)
(2)
would
be
the
more
applicable.
i
would
hesitate
to
say
that
it
could
not
be
accepted
under
first
campbell,
but
as
soon
as
the
element
of
memory
comes
in,
six
hours
of
memory,
then
i
think
we
know
from
the
legislative
history
and
from
reasons
given
in
palermo
that
it
was
not
intended.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
he
didn't,
we
don't
know.
he
didn't
have
the
chance.
well,
i
think
the
agent's
narrative
report
fails
under
(e)
(2)
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
it's
not
a
recording,
it
seems
to
me.
in
the
second
place,
if
you're
--
it's
not
substantially
verbatim,
so
there's
no
attempt
to
record
what
the
witness
said.
and
in
the
third
place,
and
each
of
these
stands
as
a
sufficient
reason,
it
certainly
wasn't
recorded
contemporaneously
whether
it
was
seven
hours
or
nine
hours
or
something
in
between,
i
can't
say
but
it
was
at
least
that
long.
now,
i
said
a
moment
ago
that
this
was
a
deliberate
decision
by
the
congress.
i'm
aware
that
the
courts
have
been
through
all
this
in
connection
with
palermo,
but
let
me
just
recall
the
fact
very,
very
briefly.
the
original
bill
reported
by
the
senate
committee
made
it
very
plain
that
the
statute
was
intended
(e)
(2)
but
they
weren't
in
that
form
then
but
the
equivalent
of
(e)
(2)
was
intended
to
be
limited
to
recordings.
and
the
senate
committee
report
quoted
some
testimony
by
the
attorney
general,
making
it
very
plain
in
words
applicable
almost
to
this
case,
that
it
was
not
intended
to
make
producible
the
agent's
reports
of
the
substance
of
what
a
witness
said.
on
the
floor,
the
sponsors
of
the
bill,
senator
o'mahoney
and
others,
struck
out
recordings
and
put
in
records.
and
i
think
if
the
word
record
had
survived,
i
would
certainly
have
a
much
harder
case.
in
fact,
i
doubt
that
i
would
care
to
argue
it
against
the
light
of
the
legislative
history.
at
that
stage,
we
know
that
from
the
debate
on
the
floor
that
the
department
of
justice
was
objecting
and
senator
dirksen
introduced
a
proposed
amendment
that
would
have
gone
back
to
recordings.
and
senator
dirksen
and
senator
roscoe
and
senator
keekal
and
their
statements
are
in
our
brief,
all
made
it
clear
that
they
were
supporting
the
amendment
and
objecting
the
senator
o'mahoney's
version
because
as
senator
keekal
put
it,
witnesses
should
not
have
thrown
at
him
records
which
are
not
agreed
to
be
--
not
agreed
to
be
the
witness'
statement.
they
didn't
want
it
unless
it
was
the
witness'
own
words.
now,
the
senate
rejected
the
dirksen
amendment
so
that
up
to
that
stage,
i
--
i
would
have
a
harder
if
not
impossible
case.
over
in
the
house,
the
bill
was
passed
in
a
form
which
made
it
perfectly
clear
whether
there
would
even
be
a
doubt
about
recordings,
that
it
took
the
very
tight
version
of
being
espoused
by
the
department
of
justice.
the
conference
committee
obviously
rejected
the
senate
version.
it
substituted
the
word
recording,
but
it
did
put
in
that
it
should
be
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
and
there
were
some
discussion
in
both
houses
about
what
was
meant.
senator
keating
said
in
the
house,
“the
conference
provided
the
only
statements
of
defendant,
provide
the
only
statements
the
defendant
could
see
and
then
only
in
the
courtroom
were
those
actually
signed
or
formally
approved
by
the
witness
or
stenographic
verbatim
recital
of
a
statement
made
by
a
witness
which
is
recorded
contemporaneously
with
the
making
of
such
oral
statement.”
in
the
senate,
senator
jarvis
made
what
i
think
was
the
most
authoritative
statement,
what
has
been
done
with
the
so-called
record
provision
is
to
tie
it
down
to
those
cases
in
which
the
agent
actually
purports
to
--
actually
purports
to
make
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
of
an
oral
statement
the
witness
has
made
to
him.
i
submit
that
anyone
who
arranged
the
testimony
here
must
conclude
that
the
witness
did
purport
either
in
the
interview
report
or
in
his
notes
to
make
a
substantially
verbatim
recital
of
the
witness'
own
words.
that
wasn't
what
they've
tried
to
do.
it
wasn't
on
the
testimony
what
they
did
and
i
submit
it
for
the
reasons
i
tried
to
indicate
before
that
to
permit
him
to
be
cross-examined
about
variations
between
his
testimony
and
that
kind
of
statement
in
a
forum
where
small
differences
can
be
exploited,
words,
his
own
words
opt
to
be
exploited
quite
properly.
but
to
subject
into
that
where
it
isn't
his
own
words
where
the
differences
may
be
somebody
else's
word,
is
to
introduce
a
false
issue,
to
distract
from
the
attention
at
the
trial
and
to
really
interfere
and
not
aid
in
the
administration
of
justice.
