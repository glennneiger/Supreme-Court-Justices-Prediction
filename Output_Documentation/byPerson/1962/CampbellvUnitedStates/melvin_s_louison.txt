mr.
melvin
s.
louison
mr.
chief
justice,
honorable
justices.
as
you
know
in
this
situation,
may
it
please
the
court,
this
particular
case
has
been
the
subject
of
two
district
court
opinions,
three
opinions
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
one
prior
opinion
of
this
court.
the
case
is
entirely
one
involving
the
scope
and
extent
as
well
as
the
interpretation
of
the
so-called
jencks
statute,
which
is
18
united
states
code,
section
3500.
now,
the
facts
of
this
case
will
work
into
the
law
as
it
is
discussed
by
myself
and
my
colleague,
mr.
o'donnell,
but
i
wish
to
begin
by
showing
the
diverse
positions
in
this
case
and
arguing
the
--
of
course,
the
position
of
the
petitioners.
in
the
first
instance,
we
have
the
palermo
decision
which
was
followed
by
the
first
campbell
case
in
which
this
court
stated
that
to
that
extent,
meaning
the
extent
as
limited
by
the
jencks
statute,
and
i
shall
refer
to
it
as
the
jencks
statute,
to
that
extent
as
the
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
jencks
act
reaffirms
our
holding
in
jencks
versus
united
states
that
the
defendant
on
trial
in
a
federal
criminal
prosecution
is
entitled
for
impeachment
purposes
to
relevant
and
competent
statements
of
a
government
witness
in
possession
of
the
government
touching
the
events
or
activities
as
to
which
the
defend
--
the
witness
has
testified
at
the
trial.
then
it
goes
on
to
say
that
the
command
of
the
statute
is
thus
designed
to
further
the
fair
and
just
administration
of
criminal
justice.
now,
that
is
followed
by
judge
wyzanski
in
the
federal
district
court
stating,
“with
reference
this
second
remand
going
back
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
that
that
court
has
still
seized
of
the
appeal.
its
judges
are
as
mindful
as
i
that
at
the
root
of
this
case
is
not
a
mere
school
master's
problem
of
construing
the
ambiguous
language
of
a
legislature,
but
the
protection
of
the
fundamental
right
of
any
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
to
impeach
a
witness
by
a
substantially
verbatim
statement
he
previously
made
and
which
he
has
adopted
and
approved.
seldom
indeed
is
there
such
a
clear
showing
as
there
has
been
in
this
case
--
as
there
has
been
here
that
exhibit
3
as
a
witness'
substantially
verbatim
statement
made
on
the
day
after
his
crime,
exhibit
3
of
course
being
the
fbi
agent's
report,
the
so-called
agent
summary.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
the
interview
report,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
think
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
sir.
it
was
referred
to
i
think
like
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
it
was
--
it
was
footnoted
in
the
official
opinion.
i
think
mr.
justice
frankfurter
referred
to
it
in
palermo
was
an
agent
summary
but
in
the
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
your
honor.
this
was
followed
by
judge
aldrich
in
the
court
of
appeals
stating
that,
if
for
any
reason
that
with
impeachment
material
does
exist,
a
defendant
is
entitle
to
have
the
benefit
of
it,
but
this
is
in
a
sense
a
windfall
rather
than
the
performance
of
a
duty
owed.
the
word
windfall
may
sound
alarming
but
either
there
is
a
duty
owed
or
there
is
not.
we
do
not
find
in
the
statute
any
such
duty.
this
is
followed
by
the
statement
of
the
united
states
government
in
its
briefs
on
page
49
that
petitioners
are
incorrect
in
assuming
that
18
u.s.c.
3500
creates
a
right
of
discovery.
now,
the
word
create
may
be
an
ambiguous
word
here.
i'm
not
sure
whether
that
means
that
the
petitioners
or
a
defendant
on
trial
in
a
criminal
case
has
no
right
of
discovery
or
whether
the
statute
does
not
create
it.
perhaps,
the
statute
itself
does
not
create
it.
it
would
appear
that
the
right
was
created
prior
to
the
statute,
of
course,
and
the
statute
in
the
petitioners'
position
was
to
limit
the
extent
of
it
and
not
to
create
it
of
itself
for
the
first
time.
of
course,
the
jencks
case
itself
which
caused
the
statute
to
be
enacted
was
not
new
nor
was
such
in
it,
it
was
very
obvious.
this
is
followed
by
the
petitioner's
position
as
set
out
in
its
brief
in
the
summary
of
argument
that
the
approach
to
be
submitted
by
the
petitioners
to
the
overall
question
of
discovery
in
a
criminal
case
under
18
u.s.c.
3500
is
that
within
the
statute,
another
words,
so
--
within
the
limitations
set
by
it
such
as
the
prior
appearance
on
direct
examination
of
the
witness.
a
defendant
on
trial
has
a
right
to
discovery.
i
don't
speak
of
the
creation
of
a
right
but
has
a
right
to
discovery
perhaps
even
a
constitutional
right
since
the
statute
to
the
extent
that
it
goes
reaffirms
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
jencks
case.
therefore,
it
is
submitted
that
discovery
is
to
be
had
fairly
liberally
within
the
framework
of
and
under
the
limitations
set
by
the
statute.
and
the
petitioners
further
stated
that
where
there
is
a
right,
there
must
be
a
corresponding
obligation
or
at
least
some
form
of
remedy
for
the
possessor
to
enforce
his
right
or
to
seek
redress
for
the
violation
or
denial
of
his
right.
now,
in
that
respect,
we
come
to
the
important
question
that
this
court
listed
in
the
first
campbell
opinion
which
was
the
interpretation
of
subsection
(d).
now,
subsection
(d)
which
provides
for
the
striking
of
a
government
witness'
testimony
from
the
record,
and
of
course,
this
would
not
be
merely
accumulated,
but
perhaps
in
the
situation
where
the
witness
has
applied
an
essential
element
in
the
statutory
crime,
a
defendant
would
be
entitled
to
a
verdict
on
the
striking
of
such
a
testimony.
this
was
a
law
enacted
by
the
congress
for
the
protection
of
the
government
and
it
is
undoubtedly
so
that
it
was
done
at
the
behest
of
the
government.
now,
this
particular
sanction
seems
severe,
it
is
one
that
the
congress'
interest
in
the
protection
of
the
government
and
the
installation
of
the
government
witness'
statements,
i
refer
to
the
fbi
because
this
is
the
agency
or
bureau
involved
in
our
particular
case,
interested
in
the
protection
of
these
fbi
files.
if
the
remedy
seems
severe,
it
is
one
that
the
congress
provided
them,
and
one
which
we
must
live
with
if
we
want
to
have
the
statute.
now,
of
course,
i
have
proposed
in
my
--
in
the
petitioners'
brief
that
there
is
an
alternative
to
the
sanction
of
striking
the
witness'
testimony
because
it
was
very
obvious
during
oral
argument
in
the
first
appearance
before
this
court
that
the
question
of
bad
faith
and
good
faith
was
going
to
arise
as
to
the
destruction
of
the
notes
and
certainly,
it
has
in
the
cases
on
jencks
law
that
has
followed
in
this
court.
now,
it
is
almost
impossible
speaking
realistically
to
show
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
an
fbi
agent
in
this
destruction
of
the
notes.
i'm
not
saying
that
it
can
or
cannot
happen.
i'm
just
saying
as
i
said
last
time,
it
is
impossible
to
know
and
i
think
that
as
practical
people,
we
can
assume
that
it
will
be
just
about
an
impossibility
to
have
a
proof
of
such
a
showing
of
bad
faith.
on
the
other
hand,
if
we
set
up
the
objectives
or
the
object
of
standard
versus
the
subject
of
standard,
we
can
come
to
a
situation
which
would
be
fairer
to
a
defendant
and
i
have
proposed
the
word,
the
phrase
secondary
evidence
and
come
to
the
agents'
interview
report.
now,
the
government's
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
except
in
one
instance
mr.
justice
brennan
where
it
was
stated
in
the
campbell
case.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
only
reading
from
the
campbell
case,
your
honor
and
the
opinion
says,
“does
--
even
if
the
interview
report
itself
were
producible,
a
situation
might
have
arisen
calling
for
decision
whether
subsection
(d)
of
the
statute
required
the
striking
of
the
testimony
of
the
witness.”
in
other
words,
the
practical
outcome
would
be
the
same
if
judge
wyzanski
is
correct
of
course
and
they
are
producible
that
will
result
in
a
reversal
of
the
conviction,
that
is
so.
but
the
legal
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
of
course.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
no,
i
don't
say
that.
no,
i
don't
say
that,
your
honor.
well,
i
should
like
then
to
start
under
section
(e)
(1),
the
production
of
the
statement
under
the
adopted
or
approval
portion
of
section
(e).
under
that
section,
the
court
stated
of
course
that
this
could
be
a
statement
taken
by
a
third
party
or
written
by
a
third
party
and
that
if
it
was
adopted
or
approved,
there
would
not
need
a
signature.
i
think
that
law
is
already
been
established,
but
in
this
instance,
we
submit
that
we
have
shown
through
the
testimony
of
both
agent
toomey
and
of
mr.
staula
himself
that
these
were
adopted
or
approved
certainly.
the
government
takes
the
position
that
it
must
have
specific
approval.
now,
i'm
not
sure
how
broad
or
narrow
the
scope
of
the
phrase
specific
approval
is,
but
if
that
phrase
means
that
it
can
only
be
an
approval
of
the
exactly
the
very
words
that
the
agent
was
given
by
the
witness,
this,
of
course,
is
not
necessarily
encompassed
by
subsection
(1)
of
the
section
(e),
for
the
reason
that
i've
used
the
phrase
in
the
brief
and
i
repeat
it
here.
it
was
stated
by
a
member
of
this
court
last
time,
it
doesn't
matter
what
his
notes
are
even
if
they'd
be
hieroglyphics
so
long
as
the
--
they
are
read
back
and
approved
by
the
witness
appearing
before
the
fbi
agent.
now,
in
that
context,
the
agent
wrote
down
the
notes.
this
is
undisputed.
he
took
notes
while
the
witness
spoke
to
him.
he
also
went
over
the
notes,
the
fbi
agent
at
various
times
said,
“no,
i
didn't
go
over
the
notes.
i
went
over
the
story,”
but
this
is
a
conclusion
which
was
given
by
the
agent
when
he
could
put
it
across
which
was
self-serving
in
nature
but
when
asked
specifically,
“what
did
you
read
back
to
him,
how
did
you
do
it,
what
did
you
say”
and
we
got
to
the
actual
factual
situation.
it
was
very
obvious
that
this
man
read
back
his
notes
just
as
any
men
who
take
notes
would
do
it,
whether
he'd
be
an
insurance
adjustor
or
an
fbi
agent.
the
job
is
to
make
sure
that
the
notes
are
taken
correctly
and
accurately.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
just
--
may
i
say
this?
judge
wyzanski
followed
that
to
a
conclusion
with
regard
to
(e)
(2).
his
whole
opinion
is
directed
towards
(e)
(2)
and
(e)
(1)
seems
to
be
--
is
followed
in
by
it.
but
if
i
may
refer
you
to
page
115
of
the
record,
about
halfway
down
where
it
says,
folio
318,
the
judge,
the
same
judge
wyzanski
said,
“for
the
benefit
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
like
to
record
what
i
just
observed
as
you
testified
in
the
illustration
which
you
gave
in
response
to
my
suggestion,”
that
is
to
tell
what
he
did
as
he
read
the
paper
--
the
notes
back.
and
he
said,
“each
time
you
look
down
at
a
piece
of
paper
before
you
spoke
a
sentence,”
and
by
the
way,
i
might
add
for
this
court
that
he
was
looking
at
exhibit
3,
the
interview
report,
“each
time
you
look
down
at
a
piece
of
paper
before
you
spoke
a
sentence
then
you'll
face
me
and
spoke
a
sentence
and
again
you
looked
at
your
exhibit
3
for
identification
and
again
spoke.
thus,
you
constantly
go
with
your
eyes
to
look
at
the
document
and
then
faced
me
and
spoke.
have
i
correctly
described
what
you
thought
you
were
doing
at
that
moment?”
the
witness
who
was
agent
toomey:
“yes,
your
honor.”
now,
when
the
examination
was
continued
by
my
colleague,
mr.
o'donnell,
he
said,
“now,
mr.
toomey
when
you
say
in
your
notes,
you
mean
you're
writing,
right?”
answer:
“yes.”
“containing
information
furnished
due
by
dominic
staula?”
“yes.”
“now,
when
you
finished
your
writing,
your
notes
with
the
information
furnished
to
you
by
dominic
staula,
you
then
ask
him
whether
or
not
your
notes
with
his
information
was
accurate,
that
is
so,
isn't?”
“yes,
sir”
and
the
following
question
is,
“please
tell
the
court
what
he
said
to
you.”
“i
can't
recall
specifically
what
he
said,
but
i
do
recall
that
he
did
not
voice
any
objection
and
that
there
was
any
inaccuracy
contained
therein.”
now,
it's
my
contention
of
course
that
that
sequence
of
events
in
the
obtaining
of
approval
is
that
the
approval
of
these
notes
within
the
scope
of
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
would
say
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
would
say
that
the
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
should
not
go
behind
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
would
say
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
that
is
--
well,
except
as
you
pointed
out
that
finding
number
three
on
page
131
of
the
record.
and
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
no,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
that
happened
was
with
judge
mccarthy's
first
hearing,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
he
did
not
comply
with
the
mandate
of
the
supreme
court.
and
they
went
on
to
say
that
rather
than
remand
it
again,
we
will
take
the
evidence
in
the
like
most
favorable
for
the
defendants
and
find
against
them,
i'm
sorry
--
and
find
the
facts
ourselves
and
at
which
time
they
found
that
it
was
not
subject.
however,
because
of
the
procedural
error
again
and
failing
to
call
the
witness,
staula,
they
sent
it
back
to
another
judge
and
disqualified
the
first
judge.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
the
court
of
--
i
would
say,
your
honor,
strictly
academically,
probably
none,
but
except
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
conclusion
when
it
said
the
decision
of
the
district
court
is
affirmed
and
the
convictions
will
stand,
we're
affirming
the
decision
of
judge
mccarthy
and
his
entry
of
the
judgments
of
conviction,
and
the
sentences
that
went
with
it.
so
in
that
respect,
of
course
judge
wyzanski
never
had
the
authority
to
enter
new
judgments
of
conviction.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
and
re-sentence
the
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
the
act
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
would
say
no,
your
honor,
not
as
you've
stated
it,
certainly
not?
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
think,
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
i
would
say
that
so
long
as
these
findings
have
factual
basis
in
the
record,
they
should
stand
and
not
to
be
gone
behind.
is
that
the
question
you're
asking?
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well,
i'm
glad
you
used
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i'm
glad
you
used
that
phrase,
your
honor,
because
i
think
they
treated
it
as
an
equity
appeal.
under
state
procedure
they
reviewed
the
evidence
and
made
their
own
conclusions
from
the
record
rather
than
be
bound
by
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well,
if
i
may
go
to
the
word
copy,
your
honors,
it's
very
obvious
that
the
original
notes
have
been
destroyed.
they
have
been
destroyed
in
what
has
been
described
as
the
routine
practices
of
the
fbi.
however,
with
the
exception
as
chief
agent
locklin
stated
in
the
record
that
an
individual
agent
has
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
he
will
destroy
his
notes.
but
other
than
that
discretionary
statement
in
the
record,
apparently
the
fbi
claims
that
this
is
a
matter
of
routine
that
after
the
interview
report
is
received
and
compared
for
accuracy,
they
destroyed
the
notes.
now,
in
campbell,
this
court
used
the
word
“copy.”
i
think
it
stated,
“is
this
interview
report
that
paper
or
a
copy
of
it?”
now,
the
court
of
appeals
has
ruled
that
the
word
“copy”
is
used
by
this
court
meant
something
which
would
be
if
recopied
on
a
typewriter,
an
exact
copy,
perhaps
subject
to
a
minor
misspelling
or
typographical
error
was
the
way
the
court
put
it.
they
went
on
to
say
--
to
use
a
footnote
to
explain
they're
talking
about
the
word
“copy”
under
(e)
(1)
and
not
(e)
(2),
because
they
made
an
exact
copy.
so
a
photocopy
or
carbon
copy
or
a
typewritten
copy
that
might
have
a
typographical
error
of
spelling
would
be
the
only
thing
that
would
satisfy
the
word
“copy”
as
used
by
this
court
and
petitioners
just
don't
see
that
at
all
and
strongly
urged
that
the
contrary
is
what
this
court
intended.
this
court
intended
something
that
would
substitute
for
the
original.
as
your
honor
know
--
as
your
honors
know
in
the
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
sir?
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
would
say
yes.
i
would
say
as
a
counterpart,
absolutely
but
not
as
a
photocopy
or
a
carbon
copy
only
as
the
court
seems
to
mean.
i
would
say
as
this
court
used
it,
it
would
mean
counterpart,
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
you
have
not
stated
that
anything
was
reduced
to
writing,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
apparently,
it
is
not
producible
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well
of
course
--
yes,
under
the
--
yes,
of
course,
if
that
were
the
--
if
the
witness
were
the
agent
that
is
so
because
i
think
that
was
ruled
in
the
clancy
case.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
of
course.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i'm
sorry.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
absolutely.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
the
producibility
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
--
(voice
overlap)
the
problem.
yes,
the
--
of
course,
i'm
aware
of
the
situation
proposed
in
the
comparing
opinion
to
palermo
where
an
fbi
agent
is
talking
to
a
third
party
citizen
witness
which
is
probably
what
mr.
justice
goldberg
was
thinking
of.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
well,
assuming
that
situation
--
and
i'm
sorry
i
overlooked
what
you
just
mentioned
mr.
justice
stewart
but
i
thought
i
interpreted
what
the
justice
asked,
where
it
was
stated
that
suppose
the
witness,
the
entire
sum
of
the
witness'
story
that
he
had
no
information
and
the
fbi's
agent's
interview
report
merely
states
in
a
very
sharp
passage
or
in
a
very
few
words
that
the
witness
had
no
information.
now,
if
i
carry
that
one
step
further,
suppose
he
appeared
in
court
and
that
was
quite
articulate
with
his
information,
would
the
interview
report
be
admissible
in
that
instance
and
i
would
say
that
that's
a
borderline
case
because
i
would
say
that's
--
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
the
crux
of
this
problem
but
i
would
say
that'd
be
would
be
a
good
case
for
that
to
be
produced
under
the
substantially
verbatim
clause.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
i
would
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
really
can't
differentiate
your
honor.
i
sincerely
feel
that
the
witness
who
has
read
back
the
statement
and
approved
it.
i
likewise
sincerely
feel
that
this
--
this
interview
report,
though
it
is
a
third
person,
it
is
written
in
indirect
--
in
this
court,
as
judge
wyzanski
said
is
nevertheless
substantially
verbatim.
there's
no
--
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
whatsoever
of
any
editorializing
by
the
agent
or
any
changing
of
words.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
thirty-minute
interview
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well,
of
course
we
don't
know
how
much
time
of
that
30
minutes
was
used
by
the
agent
himself.
sometimes
witnesses
have
to
be
prompted.
the
sequence
as
i
recall
the
record
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
would
say
yes.
this
is
the
statement
of
the
witness.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i
don't
interpret
it
along
the
lines
you're
asking
at
all
respectfully
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
the
statute
refers
to
this
witness'
statement
and
i
would
say
substantially
verbatim
refers
to
the
words
of
the
witness
and
not
the
government
agent.
i
would
think
that
it
is
clearly
so.
now,
just
prior
to
mr.
o'donnell
continuing
the
argument,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
should
like
to
say
that
the
concern
expressed
by
the
lower
courts
and
the
government
over
the
welfare
of
the
witness
is
such
that
it
does
not
differ
in
any
respect
from
ordinary
cross-examination
which
is
trying
on
a
witness
and
stated
in
one
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
in
this
case,
that
the
witness
has
the
right
to
protect
himself
and
answer,
that
he
can
--
that
he
can
answer
questions
in
accordance
with
his
knowledge
and
in
accordance
with
his
prior
statements.
and
certainly,
if
they
act
contradictory,
they
are
shown
to
be
contradictory
and
if
they
can
be
explained,
certainly
the
judge
can
allow
an
explanation
in
his
discretion
or
he
can
be
rehabilitated
by
the
government
attorney
and
redirect,
and
i
think
that's
normal
proper
procedure
and
is
not
to
--
certainly,
is
not
to
be
an
element
to
be
considered
to
limit
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
obtain
such
a
statement.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
i
should
like
to
start
my
rebuttal
by
alluding
to
a
statement
made
by
the
solicitor
general
that
this
issue
could
have
been
avoided
had
he
been
there
because
he
might
have
given
us
the
statement
and
thereby
avoided
the
issue.
let
me
say,
this
in
the
first
record
that
appeared
in
the
first
campbell
case,
the
testimony
of
the
witness
yates
that
was
also
reproduced
--
was
also
produced
and
in
that
situation,
we
had
an
identical
foundation
laid
for
the
production
of
a
statement.
and
as
i
read
some
of
the
later
cases,
i'm
not
sure
that
you
have
to
lay
the
foundation
for
production
of
these
statements,
but
in
any
event,
in
that
instance
we
did.
the
judge
ordered
the
yates
interview
report
produced
and
the
government
complied
with
it
willingly.
we
came
to
the
staula
testimony
and
we
asked
the
same
series
of
introductory
or
foundation
questions
and
the
judge,
if
you
recall
from
the
first
campbell
opinion,
did
order
it
produced.
at
that
time,
the
government
very
strenuously
objected
to
it
and
i
say
that
takes
care
of
the
government's
contention
of
guesswork
up
in
this
court
saying
that,
“well,
perhaps
he
meant
by
our
observation
this
or
perhaps
he
meant
by
observation
that.”
i
don't
say
this.
the
government
didn't
give
us
the
staula
statement
because
the
defendant
lester
would.
the
witness,
staula
was
the
only
men
in
58
government
witnesses
that
identified
the
defendant
staula
and
had
we
obtained
--
i'm
sorry,
the
defendant
lester,
excuse
me
and
had
we
obtained
that
statement,
you
may
rest
assure
that
the
likelihood
of
an
acquittal
for
at
least
that
one
defendant
would
have
been
assured.
and
i
say
that
is
the
reason
we
didn't
get
it
because
it
contained
a
bomb,
if
i
may
use
that
expression,
and
that
was
why
if
there
was
a
simple
explanation,
this
idea
of
saying,
don't
confront
a
witness
with
something
that
might
not
be
his
words,
can
anyone
say,
if
i
were
to
say
to
the
witness
right
now,
mr.
staula,
didn't
you
say
you
did
not
observe
a
third
man?
is
there
anything
to
--
is
there
anyone
to
say
that
he
wouldn't
say,
i
never
said
that.
now,
this
isn't
a
nicety
about
the
meaning
of
the
word.
this
is
a
clear
cut
proposition.
he
saw
a
third
man
or
he
didn't
see
a
third
man
and
if
he
didn't,
he
could
clearly
say
so.
at
one
point
in
the
government's
brief,
it
says
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
he
was
the
only
witness
in
the
entire
seven-week
trial
mr.
justice
brennan
that
identified
the
defendant,
staula.
there
was
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i'm
sorry.
staula
is
on
my
mind
apparently.
the
defendant,
lester
and
there
was
some
allusion
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
he
was
more
than
precise.
he
was
exact.
well,
if
it's
--
yes.
and
i
would
say
therein
you
have
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
he
--
yes.
actually,
this
was
a
--
an
experience,
let
me
put
it
that
way.
at
the
time,
he
was
sent
down
to
the
rail
and
he
stood
before
the
three
men
who
were
in
an
enforced
seating
arrangement
with
a
motion
for
sequestration
having
been
denied.
and
he
stood
before
these
three
defendants
and
he
pointed
to
one
campbell
and
then
he
didn't
--
but
didn't
say
anything.
that
doesn't
appear
on
the
record.
but
i
only
say
this,
in
real
life,
down
in
that
courtroom
as
mr.
justice
brennan
said,
we
shouldn't
go
behind
the
facts
here,
in
real
life,
that
man
pointed
to
three
defendants.
he
stated,
“i
know
campbell
resembles
one”,
and
he
definitely
identified
lester.
now,
when
he
stated
the
identification
of
lester
about
the
gas
station,
he
was
actually
saying,
“i
know
campbell
in
that
gas
station
and
not
lester”
and
the
record
shows
that
the
judge
rehabilitated
him.
in
addition
to
which,
the
record
will
show
that
everyone
of
the
government
witnesses
who
identified
a
robber
at
the
door
of
the
bank
pointed
to
alvin
campbell
as
being
the
man
in
the
blue
suit.
now,
he
says
donald
lester
was
the
man
in
the
blue
suit.
this
taken
out
of
context
and
produced
in
a
record
with
only
his
testimony
doesn't
show
the
entire
picture.
the
entire
picture
shows
that
all
three
defendants
were
intimately
wrapped
up
in
his
testimony
and
that
the
question
of
his
putting
staula
into
the
--
here,
i
go
again
--
lester
into
that
bank
was
through
this
witness
and
when
one
of
the
justices
said
that
this
was
a
crucial
witness,
i
should
hope
to
tell
you
it
was
because
this
was
the
government's
case
against
one
of
them.
now,
i
didn't
mean
to
get
excited
but
i
think
therein
lies
the
answer
to
why
we
were
given
the
exact
situation
in
the
yates
testimony
and
we
were
not
given
it.
and
i
say
this
respectfully,
certainly,
to
one
of
the
imminence
of
the
solicitor
general
but
had
he
been
there
at
the
trial,
he
might
have
seen
a
little
different
picture
than
what
appears
today
in
the
cold
print
of
the
record
before
this
honorable
body.
now,
as
i
understand
this
mr.
justice
white,
there's
utterly
no
requirement
of
substantially
verbatim
under
subsection
(e)
(1).
subsection
(e)
(1)
says
that
there
is
to
be
a
written
statement
or
written
recording
made
of
the
witness'
statement
and
that
the
witness
can
adopt
or
approve
the
notes.
now,
the
notes
do
not
have
to
be
substantially
verbatim,
but
notes
have
to
be
approved.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
the
question
was
of
a
substantial
--
a
faithful
reproduction
of
the
--
got
into
--
very
closely
related.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
very
good,
yes
sir.
i
say
that
there
was
a
situation
where
substantially
verbatim
--
in
any
event,
i
say
that
substantially
verbatim
does
not
apply
in
(e)
(1),
it
doesn't
have
to
at
all.
it's
just
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
notes,
regardless
of
how
they
were
made
up
or
how
they
were
drawn
were
approved
and
i
say
that
there's
utterly
no
question
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
that
they
were
approved.
the
words,
that's
true,
that's
what
he
said.
i
asked
the
word
--
i
asked
mr.
staula,
did
you
approve
what
he
said
and
upon
objection
of
the
government,
it
was
sustained
because
i
used
the
word
approved
and
that
word
appeared
in
the
statute
itself
and
the
judge
felt
that
that
was
not
a
proper
question.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes,
but
not
by
the
witness
necessarily,
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
yes.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
on
your
assumption.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
well,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
i
think
covered
that
both
in
palermo
and
in
campbell
when
he
said,
during
the
proceedings
in
chambers,
and
i'm
reading
from
page
107
of
365
u.s.,
during
the
proceedings
in
chambers,
the
government
repeatedly
asserted
that
the
report
was
not
in
existence
at
the
time
staula
was
interviewed.
assuming
this
to
be
true,
it
is
irrelevant.
the
question
is
whether
there
was
a
contemporaneous
recording
from
which
the
transcript
--
transcription
was
later
made.
now,
if
certainly
the
notes
made
at
the
time
the
witness
was
talking,
is
a
contemporaneous
recording,
the
transcription
was
later
made.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
if
i
may,
your
honor
please,
chief
agent
locklen
was
asked
this
question,
“what
instruction
does
an
agent
received
mr.
locklen
about
approving
or
checking
the
accuracy
of
his
notes
after
an
interview
with
the
witness?”
answer:
he
is
taught
to
go
over
them
with
the
witness
and
inquire
whether
the
story
is
as
he
has
it,
is
a
recitation
of
the
story
as
a
man
gave
it,
the
witness
gave
it.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
the
facts
of
this
case?
the
facts
of
this
case
sir
and
i
read
from
page
32
of
the
record,
the
united
state's
attorney
is
now
addressing
mr.
toomey,
the
fbi
agent,
he
said,
“having
in
mind
that
the
interview
about
which
you're
recording,
having
been
complete
about
noon,
having
in
mind
that
you
were
using
notes
which
embraced
one
direct
quotation,
some
abbreviations
and
many
key
phrases
and
having
in
mind
that
you
went
about
your
business
for
approximately
nine
hours
between
the
end
of
the
interview
and
using
of
the
--
and
not
using
of
the
dictaphone,
it
is
fair
to
say
sir
that
you
relied
a
great
deal
on
your
memory
of
what
transpired.
isn't
that
a
fair
statement?”
the
answer
by
the
fbi
agent
is,
“no
sir.
i
said
that
i
relied
primarily
on
the
notes.”
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
oh,
of
course
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
they
are.
i
think
i
introduced
it
by
saying
acting
on
his
assumption
and
i
think
that
is
so.
i
might
also
read
one
last
statement
if
i
may
and
how
you
--
in
deference
to
what
your
honor
suggested,
mr.
justice
brennan.
on
page
26
of
the
record,
“well,
mr.
toomey,
does
this
interview
report
have
the
same
meaning
as
your
notes?”
answer:
“it
does.”
now,
we
can
stay
up
here
and
hypothecate
all
day
long
but
in
view
of
the
judge's
findings,
the
record
will
clearly
substantiate
it
and
as
it
has
been
suggested
it
should
be
binding.
and
--
mr.
melvin
s.
louison
if
i
may
just
say
in
conclusion
mr.
chief
justice,
the
--
i
think
the
record
will
bear
out
the
findings
of
judge
wyzanski
and
the
petitioners
submit
that
the
conviction
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
