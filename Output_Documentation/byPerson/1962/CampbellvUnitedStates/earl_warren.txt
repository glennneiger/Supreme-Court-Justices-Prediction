we'll

shouldn't
that
be
more
an
argument
to
the
jury
on
the
credibility
of
the
witness
than
it
should
be
on
the
introduction
of
the
right
of
the
defense
to
confront
him
with
it?

on
the
other
hand,
does
it
seem
--
does
it
seem
fair
for
an
agent
to
take
a
statement
which
if
repeated
back
to
the
witness
and
confirmed
by
him
as
being
what
he
had
said
should
be
produced
at
the
trial.
but
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
witness
or
if
the
agent,
in
order
that
it
cannot
be
ordered
to
be
produced
says
to
the
witness,
and
instead
of
reading
it
back
to
him
said,
“well,
now
is
this
what
you
said”,
and
gives
him
the
gist
of
it
and
so
forth.
the
witness
says,
“yes”,
and
then
you
--
the
defense
can't
get
it.
does
that
seem
--
does
that
seem
to
be
fair
and
do
you
think
congress
if
that
precise
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
question
was
put
to
it
would've
answered
it
in
that
way?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
he
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it
happened
as
he
told
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
did
--
how
could
he
be
clear
as
to
about
something
unless
he
had
told
it?
he
had
just
–
and
he's
telling
the
agent
what
he
saw
and
what
he
knew
and
then
the
agent
granted
to
him
or
told
--
told
it
to
him
and
he
said,
“yes,
that's
the
way
it
happened.”
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
must
admit
that's
the
way
it
happened
as
i
told
you
it
happened.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
don't
(voice

--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
didn't
say
this
man
was.
i
was
thinking
about
the
consequences
if
we
ruled
that
that
could
be
done.
chief
justice

where
is
that
general?
chief
