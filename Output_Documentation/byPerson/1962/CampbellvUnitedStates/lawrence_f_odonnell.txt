mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
finding
of
the
court
and
the
record
in
support
of
the
fbi
interview
report
that
as
in
the
record
and
was
previously
set
out
in
your
former
campbell
opinion
that
that
is
producible.
the
finding
supported
by
the
record
is
that
that
interview
report
so
captioned
by
the
fbi
agent,
john
toomey
is
producible
in
behalf
of
the
petitioners.
it
wasn't
produced
and
therefore
i
say
that
petitioners
are
entitled
to
a
reversal.
now,
may
it
please
the
court,
insofar
as
the
proposition
is
concerned,
the
record
stands
in
the
findings
of
judge
wyzanski
that
evidence
supported
his
conclusions,
but
i
say
this,
considering
the
government's
brief,
we
have
this
type
of
a
situation.
i
say
it's
an
--
indisputable
that
the
jencks
act
merely
reaffirms
the
jencks'
decision
and
that
this
proposition
and
--
at
the
trial
level
of
the
case
to
ask
a
government
witness
or
any
witness
whether
or
not
they've
made
a
prior
statement
and
--
to
lay
a
foundation
for
it
is
something
that
is
common
place
in
the
law
and
has
been
part
of
the
law
for
many,
many
years.
so
in
analogy,
what
we
have
here
is
a
principle
of
law
that's
been
followed
by
the
court
for
many
years.
all
we
have
is
our
old
friendly
principle
dressed
in
formal
clothes
and
he
has
a
congressional
past.
however,
insofar
as
this
--
application
of
this
law
that
the
trial
level
is
concerned,
i
see
now
after
having
the
opportunity
of
examining
agent
toomey
on
two
occasions
and
originally
examining
dominic
staula,
it
reminds
me
as
a
person
that
tries
cases
that
stereotype
is
coming
in
to
the
defense
of
producing
these
documents.
and
by
that,
i
mean
this,
we
know
when
not
to
belabor
this
august
court
with
the
proposition
like
trial
of
a
drunk
driving
case
but
we
know
there's
some
ritualistic
stereotype
statements
that's
constantly
coming
from
the
witness
stand
such
as
glassy
eyes,
thick
speech,
he
staggered,
we
hear
that
all
the
time.
now,
there's
been
introduced
some
new
slogans.
they
are
jottings,
abbreviations,
and
that
comes
in
when
someone
wants
to
deny
the
production
of
a
report.
and
i
say
that
the
government's
brief
is
covered
with
the
slogans
and
ritualistic
statements
of
jottings
of
the
agent,
investigative
notes,
summary,
not
verbatim,
not
substantially
verbatim.
that's
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes
sir.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes
i
am
your
honor
but
i
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor.
i
saw
that
in
the
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
i
certainly
wouldn't
but
i
just
drew
that
analogy,
may
it
please,
mr.
justice
brennan,
on
the
proposition
that
the
record
doesn't
bear
out
these
key
phrases
and
abbreviations.
and
in
support
of
the
record
and
the
conclusions
as
found
by
judge
wyzanski,
i
think
it
does
violence
to
reason
for
anyone
who
think
as
it
show
the
record
that
this
fbi
agent
of
16
years
experience
and
the
records
supports
that
he's
out
interviewing
a
--
an
eyewitness
to
a
bank
robbery.
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
interview
is
private.
he's
with
him
in
a
police
station
and
he's
sitting
down
taking
it.
and
therefore,
the
record
supports
that
he
took
the
observations
of
dominic
staula
and
asked
him
what
he
observed
in
the
bank
and
he
was
told
that.
so,
with
that
in
mind,
when
we
come
to
the
various
provisions
of
the
3500
in
the
trial
of
cases
when
one
is
attempting
with
his
responsibility
to
impeach
a
witness,
we
come
up
against
the
test
of
verbatim,
a
defendant
has
a
test
of
substantially
verbatim,
i
say
that
there
was
an
attempt
in
congress
to
have
it
verbatim
but
that
yielded
to
something
less
than
verbatim.
so
what
would
happen?
we
have
experiences
in
the
trial
of
cases
of
what
legal
tests
are.
in
--
on
the
civil
side
of
the
court,
a
person
can
lose
a
fortune
on
the
legal
test
of
fair
preponderance
of
evidence
and
on
the
criminal
side
of
the
court,
the
government
has
a
burden
of
proving
as
a
legal
test
that
we're
familiar
with
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
the
modal
of
certainty
every
element
of
a
crime.
now,
there's
a
test
shifted
over
to
a
defendant
concerning
the
wall
of
evidence
as
we
read
the
circuit's
opinion
of
something
that
we
have
to
get
the
exactness
of
some
science
that
just
wouldn't
be
in
keeping
with
the
science
of
jurisprudence.
so
in
this
regard,
we
can't
overlook
propositions
that
when
you
do
find
yourself
confronted
with
looking
for
report,
i
say,
and
i
say
respectfully
that
there
seems
to
be
in
the
courtroom
that
people
reason
what
their
glean.
if
the
phrase
fbi
is
mentioned,
suddenly
right
on
the
remand
of
this
case,
we
heard
such
phrases
as
we
were
examining
an
fbi
agent
that
i've
--
not
while
this
country
is
having
a
rendezvous
with
destiny,
i've
got
too
many
grandchildren,
you're
not
going
to
put
this
flag
in
half
mast
and
so
forth.
this
is
the
--
and
what
we're
looking
for
is
something
that's
not
a
vast
secret
in
the
department
of
justice
but
something
that
involves
a
person
outside
the
department
of
justice
that's
already
testified
for
the
government
and
we're
merely
looking
to
examine
them.
and
i
go
further
it
seems
as
though
--
and
it's
obvious
that
when
we
think
of
that
department
of
the
government
then
they
naturally
hold
out
that
law
enforcement
serves
a
high
purpose
and
that
the
big
brother
to
law
enforcement
throughout
the
nation
that
you
now
can
say
that
their
agent
with
16
years
experience
had
any
motive
for
taking
a
bad
report,
wasn't
capable
of
taking
an
accurate
report
which
the
record
supports.
and
i
further
say
this
that
when
we're
dealing
with
this
bureau,
i
know
that
they
have
a
lot
of
prestige
when
they're
on
the
witness
stand
and
i
say
that
the
year
books
of
the
encyclopedia
britannica
indicate
to
us
that
their
success
in
court
averages
something
around
94%
or
95%
or
96%
guilties
and
the
vast
number
of
that
on
pleas.
so
when
a
trial
of
a
case,
i
say
that
congress
never
intended
to
set
up
a
congressional
blockade
so
that
someday
the
reports
might
contain
100%
convictions
of
all
the
matters
treated.
so,
may
it
please
the
court,
i
feel
that
what
we
have
here
to
decide
on
the
already
existing
record
is
not
the
slogans,
not
the
stereotype,
ritualistic
statements.
it's
not
in
the
government
brief
but
in
the
record
that
it
will
show
mr.
toomey
stated
them
as
mr.
staula
that
they
had
a
conference
and
that
an
accurate
and
reasonable
report
that
is
producible
was
had.
so
i
respect
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
i
would
say,
may
it
please,
mr.
justice
goldberg
that
is
producible
under
both
sections.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor
--
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
yes.
mr.
justice
goldberg,
first
of
all,
i
would
say,
we're
not
confronted
with
the
test
of
verbatim.
so
when
the
actions
are
being
confronted
with
the
test
of
verbatim,
3500
calls
were
substantially
verbatim.
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
and
for
a
legal
definition
of
what
a
statement
is
in
the
trial
of
a
case,
i
would
say
that
is
substantially
verbatim,
the
agent
treats
with
500
words,
mr.
staula's
approach
to
the
bank,
his
observations
outside
the
bank
before
he
entered,
his
observations
upon
entering
the
teller's
window,
he
walked
up
to
what
he
heard,
what
he
saw.
and
i'd
say
in
a
legal
definition
that
this
court
will
determine
that
it
is
a
substantially
verbatim
statement
under
(e)
(2).
mr.
lawrence
f.
o'donnell
mr.
chief
justice,
just
one
comment,
may
it
please
the
court.
on
page
113
of
the
record
before
the
court
in
support
of
judge
wyzanski's
findings,
halfway
down
to
show
that
there's
evidence
of
approval.
i
put
the
question
to
agent
toomey.
“now,
mr.
toomey,
would
you
please
tell
this
court
what
technique
you
employed
at
the
moment
when
mr.
staula
--
with
mr.
staula
to
show
your
notes
were
accurate.”
answer:
“after
mr.
staula
recited
the
happenings
of
the
day
before
and
i
took
notes
concerning
what
he
had
said,
i
asked
him
several
questions
and
took
notes
concerning
his
answers
to
those
questions.
i
then
went
over
the
entire
story
with
mr.
staula
in
narrative
form,
referring
to
my
notes
and
when
i
finished,
i
asked
him
if
the
story
was
correct.”
question:
“and
what
did
mr.
staula
say
to
you?”
answer:
“he
agreed
that
the
story
was
correct.”
