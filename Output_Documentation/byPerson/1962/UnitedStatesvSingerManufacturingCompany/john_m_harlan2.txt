justice
john
m.
harlan
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
is
this
a
factual
case
that
we
have
to
--
for
you
to
prevail,
do
we
have
to
overturn
[inaudible]?
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
you
accept
the
findings?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
what
year
was
this?
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
master
issue
in
this
case
surely
is
the
purpose
of
these
arrangements,
isn't
it?
were
they
entered
into
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
trade
or
were
they
entered
into
for
legitimate
purposes
to
protect
the
patent
position
of
the
singer
company?
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
your
findings
of
the
district
court
are
against
you
on
that
and
i
don't
yet
understand
how
you
can
escape
the
district
court's
findings
and
accept
them
and
still
argue
your
case
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
will
turn
the
question
around,
i
asked
you
about
the
purpose
and
motive.
what
errors
of
law
did
the
district
court
made
for
each
of
these
[inaudible]
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
the
district
court
--
i
mean
you
--
do
you
think
that
the
district
court
did
not
recognize
that
if
two
competitors
get
together
to
block
the
entry
of
a
foreign
competitor
that
that
doesn't
violate
the
sherman
act?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
mean
that
a
conspiracy
in
this
kind
of
situation
has
to
be
by
express
agreement
rather
than
inferred
from
facts?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
want
to
be
very
frank
with
you.
my
trouble
is
that,
i
think
if
you
said
it
frankly
that
you
didn't
think
the
findings
made
with
the
district
court
was
supported
by
evidence,
that
i
could
understand,
but
i
can't
understand
up
today
at
least,
how
you
can
accept
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
still
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
can't
find
out
what
your
point
is.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
it
all
depends
upon
the
motive
and
the
purpose
of
the
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
that's
a
very
basic
crucial
finding
in
this
case,
isn't
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
mean,
given
that
finding,
unupset,
can
you
prevail
in
this
case?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
think
you've
got
--
i
think
you've
got
to
overturn
the
basic
findings,
that's
where
i
started
out
with
and
i
was
surprised
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
i'm
not
saying
that
you
can't
do
it.
i'm
not
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
no,
but
it
is
a
very
crucial
finding.
it's
the
finding.
it's
the
basic
finding
in
which
your
position
seems
to
me
has
to
meet.
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
there
evidence
that
there
was
suppression
of
some
kind
here
as
a
result
of
this
agreement?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
agreement
has
a
tendency
to
further
that
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
your
point.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
long
does
this
case
take
the
charge
mr.
pettit?
justice
john
m.
harlan
was
it
an
exclusive
or
non-exclusive?
justice
john
m.
harlan
of
course,
the
government
will
argue
that
while
that
maybe
very
unhappy,
that's
what
the
sherman
act
permits
and
is
intended
to
accomplish?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
as
to
that.
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
district
court
found
that
other
than
these
patent
arrangements
there
is
no
a
collateral
understanding
and
no
arrangement,
formal
or
informal,
between
gegauf
and
your
clients
to
keep
these
japanese
machines
off
the
american
market?
justice
john
m.
harlan
can
you
tell
me
quickly
what
pages
of
the
record,
referring
to
this
episode,
this
clause,
to
not
run
into
your
argument,
we'll
do
it
later.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well
i've
got
the
clause,
but
the
testimony
on
the
basis
of
which
the
district
court,
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
this
is
and
they
do
apply
to
united
states.
justice
john
m.
harlan
no
don't
stop
now.
justice
john
m.
harlan
does
the
record
show
any
--
has
the
record
got
any
evidence
in
it
that
by
price
manipulation
or
in
any
other
way
singer
tried
to
keep
japanese
machines
out
of
this
country?
justice
john
m.
harlan
quite
from
actual
efforts,
is
there
any
indication
that
the
party
had
that
sort
of
thing
in
mind?
