mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
is
a
clear
concept
of
what
this
case
is
all
about.
i
like
to
stress
at
the
very
beginning
that
it
involves
fundamentally
one
thing
and
one
thing
only
and
that
is
the
acquisition
and
enforcement
by
singer,
gegauf
patent
number
one,
a
patent
which
covered
machine
which
it
invented,
developed,
manufactured
and
sold
and
there
is
no
other
element
that's
involved
here
now.
this
case
started
out
and
the
government
started
it.
it
alleged
that
there
were
of
course
agreements
and
understandings
outside
of
the
written
agreements.
it
alleged
that
these
agreements
and
understandings
were
made
to
vigorelli
and
gegauf.
it
alleged
that
the
agreements
were
to
have
transferred
from
gegauf,
two
gegauf
patents
to
be
used
in
combination
with
three
singer
patents
against
the
japanese
and
the
japanese
only
and
there
was
a
complete
pooling
charge.
now
the
government
has
lost
on
every
single
issue.
the
trial
court
found
and
after,
you
can
see
a
very
extensive
examination,
that
there
was
no
agreement
or
conspiracy
of
any
kind,
no
agreement
or
understanding
made
in
connection
with
anyone
of
the
three
acquaintances.
it
was
not
as
counsel
stated
that
the
trial
court
found
that
merely
in
connection
with
the
assignment
agreement.
there
was
no
outside
agreement.
it
found
in
respect
to
the
vigorelli
license
agreement,
in
respect
to
the
gegauf
license
agreement
and
in
respect
to
the
gegauf
assignment
agreement.
in
each
instance
separately,
it
found
that
there
was
no
understanding
or
agreement
of
any
kind
between
gegauf
and
singer
as
to
the
use
of
the
patent,
whether
it
would
be
licensed,
whether
it
would
be
enforced
or
anything
whatever
to
do
with
singer's
use
of
the
patent.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
22
days
it
occupied;
there
are
over
900
exhibits.
the
counsel
before
the
trial
court
occupied
at
least
19
sessions
and
i
think
more
in
pre
--
pre-trial
conferences.
it
sat
in
on
the
drawing
of
stipulation
which
occupies
a
very
substantial
number
of
pages
in
this
record.
the
counsel
marked
at
the
directions
of
the
court,
every
single
letter
and
submitted
it.
they
crossed
mark
them.
government
counsel
marked
in
red,
defense
counsel
marked
in
blue,
every
single
line
that
was
considered
significant
by
either
party
in
any
document.
those
documents
were
submitted
to
the
trial
court.
they
were
argued
for
nine
days
and
i
can
assure
you
there's
no
significance
that
any
counsel
connected
with
the
case
thought
there
was
in
any
of
those
documents
that
was
not
called
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court.
there's
been
probably
as
exhaustive
and
as
careful
an
analysis
of
all
the
documents,
as
it's
possible
for
a
trial
court
to
give
to
a
case.
it
had
also
before
it
the
testimony
of
the
chief
and
principal
negotiator
who
attended
every
conference
who
is
not
mr.
waterman
as
stated
by
mr.
friedman
but
was
mr.
stanford,
a
counsel
and
a
patent
counsel.
he
attended
every
single
conference.
he
was
on
the
stand
for
a
large
number
of
days
and
was
cross
--
cross-examined
handling
by
the
government.
on
the
basis
of
all
these
testimony
and
of
all
of
this
experience,
the
trial
court
found
not
only
that
there
was
no
agreement
and
no
conspiracy.
it
used
the
word
that
it
had
no
significance
except
respect
to
the
depth
of
its
feeling.
having
found
in
several
occasions
before
that
there
was
no
agreement
of
any
kind
and
no
understanding
it
came
to
a
point
later
where
the
government
is
trying
to
relate
a
provision
in
the
agreement
to
an
underlying
conspiracy
to
pool
patents.
the
trial
court
said,
“this
is
probably
the
fourth
time
it
came
to
it,
we
have
before
found
that
there
absolutely
was
no
agreement
or
conspiracy.”
now,
obviously,
it
absolutely
doesn't
add
much
except
as
a
matter
of
feeling
because
if
there
was
no
agreement
or
no
conspiracy,
there
was
none.
but
when
the
trial
court
in
this
opinion
after
stating
several
times,
says,
“absolutely,
no
agreement
or
no
conspiracy”,
you
know
the
intensity
of
his
feeling
with
reference
to
all
of
this
testimony.
i
do
not
deem
that
it's
possible
to
read
the
record
in
this
case
or
read
the
statement
of
facts
that
we
prepared
without
coming
to
the
same
conclusion
because
there
just
literally
is
nothing
to
the
government's
case
in
any
respect.
our
--
i'm
sorry
that
our
brief
is
so
long
but
after
all
this
phase
covered
a
period
of
four
years.
it
involved
not
only
the
three
contracts
between
singer
and
gegauf,
it
involved
a
cross-license
agreement
with
vigorelli,
with
mr.
smith,
license
agreement
with
sears
and
many
other
agreements.
all
of
these
had
to
be
gone
into
in
addition
to
many
other
considerations
for
the
purpose
of
determining
the
attitude,
purpose,
intent
of
these
parties
in
dealing
throughout.
now,
the
government
would
have
you
believe
that
the
trial
court
was
under
the
impression
that
if
it
found
that
there
was
no
agreement,
that
that
settled
the
case.
then
we'd
have
another
parke-davis
case
where
the
trial
court
was
under
the
impression
that
if
there
was
not
an
agreement,
it
settled
it,
and
there
could
be
no
conspiracy
and
no
combination
without
it.
the
trial
court
to
the
contrary,
went
into
every
single
argument
that
the
government
put
up,
trying
to
show
that
even
outside
of
the
agreement,
there
were
a
--
or
was
a
what
you
would
call
a
combination
or
a
conspiracy
between
these
two
parties
to
get
to
a
particular
result.
the
court
spent
pages
on
it
and
you
can
find
it
and
i
can
cite
in
the
reference
to
1693
and
1694,
1705
to
1740,
are
literally
pages
of
the
court's
opinion
dealing
with
various
facts
that
the
government
raised
in
trying
to
show
that
there
was
a
concerted
action,
unity
of
purpose,
common
design.
there
was
hardly
any
combination
of
words
that
could
be
used,
that
the
government
didn't
use
in
this
case
because
it
soon
found
that
it
was
hopeless
to
find
any
agreement,
whatever,
between
singer
and
gegauf.
the
trial
court
made
the
very
express
finding
that
there
was
no
common
purpose
and
no
unity
of
purpose
here,
whatever.
and
it
found
that
the
sole
purpose
and
singer's
sole
interest
in
acquiring
this
patent
was
to
protect
its
own
product.
now,
if
i
may
just
add
one
word
so
we
could
bear
with
it
and
i
want
to
point
out
that
nothing
is
involved
in
--
with
respect
to
the
restraint
of
any
trade
whatever
other
than
a
sewing
machine
that
infringes
gegauf
patent
number
one.
there's
no
--
there's
no
argument.
there's
need
no
allegation
now.
there's
no
contention,
whatever,
that
the
purpose
was
to
exclude
other
machines.
the
phrase
has
been
used.
they
use
it
through
their
brief
frequently,
japanese
competitors,
but
when
it's
analyzed,
it
is
always
in
reference
to
japanese
competitors
selling
infringed
sewing
machines.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
make
clear
one
point
concerning
the
defendant’s
intention
that
maybe
this
need
not
be
done,
but
i
want
to
make
sure.
mr.
justice
harlan
asked
mr.
friedman
on
friday
whether
it
was
the
government’s
contention
that
the
trial
court
did
not
realize
that
an
agreement
could
be
implied
from
the
facts.
mr.
friedman
answered
that
that
seemed
to
be
the
tone
of
the
opinion
and
i
think
even
affirmatively
said,
yes.
but
after
another
question,
he
corrected
that
and
he
stated
that
the
trial
court
had
found
that
there
was
no
express
agreement
and
that
there
was
no
implied
agreement.
the
government
accepts
these
findings
and
there
is
therefore
no
contention
from
the
government
in
this
case
that
the
trial
court
overlooked
the
possibility
of
inferring
an
agreement
from
the
facts.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
i
said
before
the
trial
court
and
i
say
here
with
pleasure
that
singer
wished
to
obtain
this
patent
in
order
to
enforce
it.
it
had
obtained
an
order
to
enforce
it
and
having
obtained
it,
it
has
tried
to
enforce
it.
its
every
purpose
was
to
obtain
this
patent
and
by
the
use
of
it,
exclude
machines
infringing
that
patent.
no
other
machine,
no
other
competitor,
only
those
who
are
dealing
in
infringing
machines.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that's
correct.
there
had
never
been
any
question
on
that
from
the
beginning.
i
stated
that
at
the
opening
of
the
trial
and
i
state
it
here.
now
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
yes,
indeed.
that
was
the
whole
trouble.
the
gegauf
patent
was
as
mr.
friedman
said
nine
days
ahead
of
singer's
harris
patent
and
it
discovered
this
during
negotiations
with
vigorelli.
it
was
therefore
in
the
position
in
which
a
machine
which
it
had
itself
invented,
developed
was
producing
and
selling
could
be
excluded
by
gegauf
from
the
united
states
market.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that's
the
first
thing
that
they
did,
was
to
–-
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
complete
license
for
the
life
of
the
patent.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
so
once
that
agreement
was
made,
singer
had
a
license
under
which
it
could
operate
for
the
duration
of
the
patent.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
to
be
able
to
manufacture,
yes
indeed.
the
purpose
of
the
acquisition
was
to
protect
the
singer's
machines.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
it
was
a
non-exclusive
license.
and
singer
had
cross-license,
they
cross-licensed
their
respective
patents.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
no,
i
did
not
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
white,
yes.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
no,
white
is
a
company
that
formerly
manufactured
it
in
the
united
states
and
it
went
out
of
business
because
of
manufacturing,
because
of
the
influx
of
the
japanese
machines.
it
now
buys
these
machines
from
the
manufacturers
in
japan
and
distributes
them
in
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
it
would.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
well,
i
of
course
do
not
know
what
this
particular
machine
that
they're
advertising,
but
they
have
of
course
been
importing,
did
import
during
these
years
infringing
machines.
there
are
machines
that
are
multiple-cam
machines
that
are
not
infrangible.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
certainly.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
and
i
would
like
in
connection
with
that
to
just
give
a
little
background
on
this.
immediately
or
say
in
1947,
the
japanese
imported
no
sewing
machines
into
this
country.
and
before
the
war,
they
had
imported
none,
one
year
one
machine
another
year
one
machine.
but
few
imports
they
had,
had
been
to
countries
adjacent
to
japan,
they
were
imports
into
those
countries.
they
started
with
none
in
1947
and
by
1959;
they
were
importing
1,100,000
machines
per
year.
the
affect
of
that
was
utterly
disastrous
to
the
sewing
machine
manufacturing
industry
in
the
united
states.
when
it
started,
there
were
seven
manufacturers
in
addition
to
singer.
when
1959
arrived,
there
was
not
one
single
manufacture
of
sewing
machines
left
in
the
united
states.
singer
alone
survived
with
one
minor
exception
of
a
company
that
manufactures
for
a
particular
company
on
specifications,
but
does
not
manufacture
to
sell
gegauf.
with
that
exception,
every
single
manufacturer
had
been
put
out
of
business
by
this
competition.
now
i
think
that
the
purchase
of
this
patent
must
be
viewed
in
that
light.
singer
survived
it,
but
it
survived
it
solely
because
it
was
so
well
established,
so
big
and
had
such
resources
that
it
could
survive
this
delegate.
it's
percentage
of
the
market
went
down
from
--
by
competing
--
i'll
get
to
the
exact
figures
here,
if
i
may,
just
one
minute
from
--
they
went
down
from
57%
to
around
30%.
their
manufacturing
of
machines,
their
portion
of
the
market
also
went
down
the
same
way
in
the
manufacturing
in
the
united
states.
they
resorted
to
bringing
in
machines
from
abroad
to
a
very
large
extent,
bringing
in
as
many
as
193,000
in
one
year.
now
it
has
survived
that
and
it
has
come
back
to
a
certain
degree,
but
not
to
what
it
was
and
as
of
the
last
year,
the
japanese
had
over
60%
of
the
sewing
machine
market
in
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that
is
correct,
but
it
also
--
my
answer
to
that
would
be,
that
it
is
intended
also
to
permit
companies
to
use
reasonable
means
to
protect
themselves
in
their
own
business.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that
is
correct.
it
found
it
expressly
and
several
different
times.
it
said
that
there
was
absolutely
no
agreement,
no
conspiracy,
no
arrangement
of
any
kind
between
singer
and
gegauf
and
that
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
there
is
no
such
correspondence
that
i
know.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
well,
he
referred
to
a
communication
from
gegauf
saying
that
gegauf
had
not
disclosed
that
singer
was
proceeding
on
singer's
then
owned
patents.
he
did
not
point
out
that
that
information
came
to
gegauf
from
a
letter
that
gegauf
had
received
from
singer.
so
gegauf
was
merely
saying
that
he
had
not
disclosed
to
certain
people
in
germany
that
singer
had
brought
these
actions
on
these
patents
and
in
doing
it,
he
referred
to
your
patent
and
ours,
but
by
that
purely
colloquial
he
meant
the
patent
that
used
to
be
ours
and
the
information
that
these
actions,
that
this
action
when
brought
came
to
him
by
a
letter
from
singer.
so
there
is
no
statement
there
that
he
knew
these
actions
were
going
to
be
brought,
but
i
think
that's
immaterial.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
whatever
that
he
knew
that
singer
was
going
to
enforce
the
patent
when
it
got
it.
now,
singer
had
said
to
gegauf
that
the
reason
singer
wanted
the
patent
was
that
singer
could
enforce
it
better
than
gegauf
could.
singer
was
paying
gegauf
$90,000
for
the
patent.
singer
was
manufacturing
a
machine
that
was
under
it
and
there
were
infringers
coming
in.
now,
it's
no
secret.
i
think
the
man
who
just
has
normal
intelligence
could
not
help
but
note
that
singer
was
going
to
enforce
the
patent
[inaudible],
he
would
otherwise
would
not
be
paying
$90,000
to
get
it,
its
just
simple.
and
i
say
that
that
is
the
fact
that
anyone
would
have
known
and
that
gegauf
did
know
and
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
wrong
in
the
discussions
that
took
place
that
merely
recognized
what
the
fact
of
the
life
were,
of
course
it
was
going
to
that.
but
it
is
crystal
clear
that
singer
was
protecting
itself
at
every
minute
from
getting
into
any
entanglement
with
gegauf
and
any
kind
of
an
agreement
express,
implied
or
otherwise
that
singer
would
operate
with
these
patents
in
a
particular
way.
singer
wanted
to
get
the
patents
in
order
to
be
the
complete
owner
of
it.
the
correspondence
will
show
that
time-after-time
it
referred
to
the
fact
that
it
wanted
become
the
complete
owner.
at
one
point,
it
was
pointed
out
that
the
advantage
of
making
a
purchase
and
paying
it
and
not
paying
all
these
works
that
they
would
be
true
with
gegauf.
now
the
trial
court
has
gone
through
all
of
those
and
has
found
that
they
are
clear
and
you
remember
my
saying
the
other
day
that
he
said,
absolutely,
there
was
no
agreement,
no
understanding
of
any
nature
whatsoever.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
well,
i
would
say
that
the
basic
agreement
was
not
for
one
you
just
mentioned
it
was
the
license
agreement
itself
and
that
is
another
point
that
the
trial
court
has
made
a
finding
on.
it
made
the
finding
that
the
purpose
of
the
license
--
of
the
cross-license
agreement
which
of
course
came
first,
that
the
purpose
of
the
cross-license
agreement
was
to
obtain
a
license.
that
was
the
essence
of
it,
that's
what
the
party's
consider
was
important.
now
i
would
come
to
that
whole
point,
because
it
is
a
separate
point
and
i
would
--
i
intend
to
refer
to
it
later.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
there
are
two
agreements.
in
the
cross
--
in
the
first
agreement
was
of
april
16
1956,
in
which
the
cross-license
agreement
was
entered
into.
in
that
agreement
there
was
the
clause
that
was
designed
to
be
the
normal
non-litigating
clause.
it
said
we
will
not
litigate
with
each
other.
they
have
tried
to
construe
that
into
a
sinister
provision.
there
was
nothing
sinister
whatever
about
it.
it
was
merely
intended
to
put
in
the
usual
provisions
for
not
litigating,
when
they
had
settled
their
litigation
or
prospective
litigation
by
entering
into
the
cross-license
agreement.
as
you
pointed
out
the
other
day
mr.
justice
goldberg,
there
is
a
provision
in
there
that
this
is
to
be
done
in
accordance
with
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
state
involved.
now
that
is
briefed
and
quite
completely
on
several
different
points
in
our
briefs.
the
government
itself
concedes
that
there
was
nothing
improper
with
the
cross-license
agreement
and
it
only
picks
up
this
clause
to
say
that
that
isolated
in
standing
alone
is
itself
an
illegal
agreement.
in
connection
with
that
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
the
government's
argument
before
the
trial
court
was
that
the
first
sentence
of
that
clause
was
illegal.
that
was
the
sentence
that
provided
that
neither
party
would
do
anything
to
restrict
the
scope
of
the
claim
of
the
other.
now,
they
overlooked
the
fact
that
in
various
european
countries
there
are
proceedings,
special
types
of
proceedings
that
are
known
as
proceedings
to
restrict
the
scope
of
claims.
it
is
quite
clear
that
that
provision
was
intended
to
take
care
of
that
situation.
the
man
who
drafted
this
provision,
he
didn't
draft
it,
but
who
put
it
into
final
shape
was
stanford,
who
had
prepared
similar
agreements
with,
had
prepared
similar
agreements
with
vigorelli,
who
subsequently
prepared
another
agreement
with
masonite.
he
found
in
the
draft
that
was
submitted
by
gegauf,
a
provision
that
would
have
stopped
any
interference.
now
he
deliberately
redrafted
that
and
divided
them
into
two
sections
with
the
concept
that
he
was
getting
exactly
the
same
result
with
this
provision
as
he
was
getting
with
the
vigorelli
agreement.
an
agreement
that
mr.
friedman
and
the
government
has
consistently
said,
is
almost
a
model
of
perfection
in
making
the
reach
of
the
agreement
not
to
restrict,
go
to
those
countries
that
had
that
type
of
procedures.
now
the
trial
court
went
into
this.
it
heard
the
testimony
of
the
people,
yet
held
that
that
clause
was
intended
to
cover
the
foreign
countries
and
not
to
apply
to
the
united
states.
in
the
course
of
making
its
argument
before
the
trial
court,
it
expressively
told
the
trial
court
that
that
was
the
only
provision
in
the
cross-license
agreement
that
it
considered
to
be
illegal.
it
set
it
up,
it
quoted
the
sentence
in
quote,
in
the
entire
time
of
this
discussion
we
cannot
find
one
single
instance
in
which
the
government
even
set
forth
in
full
the
second
sentence
of
this
clause.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
where
it
sets
forth
the
clause?
the
clause
is
set
forth
at
1067.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that's
mr.
stanford's
testimony
and
i'll
find
in
just
a
minute
and
i
will
give
it
to
you
but
it
is
testimony
of
mr.
stanford.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
the
government
both
in
it's
--
in
the
document
submitted
just
before
the
trial
and
in
another
one
the
post
trial
brief
just
after
this,
as
i
say,
expressly
told
the
court
that
that
was
the
only
provision
that
it
being
illegal.
now
it
raises
before
this
court
for
the
first
time
the
argument
that
the
second
sentence
is
illegal.
it
seems
rather
strange
system
to
me
that
the
court
--
that
before
the
trial
court
the
government
can
just
frankly
say
that
it
doesn't
conceive
that
there
is
anything
illegal
and
then
when
it
loses
in
the
point
that
it
is
making,
it
comes
before
this
court
and
asks
that
the
trial
court
to
be
reversed
in
the
ground
that
it
did
not
find
the
clause
illegal,
which
it
told
the
trial
court
it
didn't
contend
as
illegal.
furthermore,
the
clause
is
clearly
not
illegal.
they
never
say
that
there
is
a
clause
that
says
that
we
will
facilitate
the
allowance
of
claims
as
broad
as
possible,
but
this
is
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
country
and
patent
office
involved.
it
couldn't
be
clear
from
the
evidence
that
singer
was
wanting
a
valid
patent
and
not
an
illegally
broad
patent.
there
certainly
is
no
compulsion
in
the
finding
that
--
compulsion
to
find
that
when
a
person
says
a
patent
is
broad
as
possible
he
means
one
beyond
the
reach
of
the
law
and
into
the
prior
art.
and
more
than
one
says
to
get
to
particular
destination
as
soon
as
possible,
he
doesn't
mean
necessarily
there
is
no
compulsion
to
find
that
he
means
by
violation
of
all
the
law
without
reference
to
anybody
that
stands
there.
now
when
they
ask,
when
they
provide
that
they
should
get
and
support
and
facilitate
and
there's
nothing
but
facilitate,
claims
as
broad
as
possible,
i
think
that
without
anything
else,
it
would
be
construed
as
meaning
within
the
limits
of
the
law
and
within
the
permission
of
the
prior
art.
otherwise,
you
are
saying
that
they
are
flatly
making
an
agreement
to
support
illegal
claims.
the
evidence
is
quite
clear
that
they
didn't.
stanford
testified,
stanford
wrote
letters
during
the
period
in
which
he
pointed
out
the
necessity
of
getting
a
valid
patent.
the
government
makes
a
strange
argument
in
connection
with
this.
it
seems
to
imply,
but
it
doesn't
say
so.
it
has
never
once
said
that
it
construes
this
as
requiring
either
company
to
support
an
illegal
claim,
yet
it
seems
to
imply.
and
at
the
same
time,
it
argues
that
the
reason
they
did
that
was
that
singer
wanted
to
fight
this
tremendous
japanese
influx
of
sewing
machines.
now
the
last
thing
in
the
world
the
singer
would
want
would
be
an
invalid
patent
in
order
to
use
it
against
the
power
as
terrific
as
the
japanese
exports.
the
japanese
sewing
machine
industry
has
been
the
second,
third
or
fourth
largest
export
industry
in
japan
for
ten
consecutive
years.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
none,
whatever.
this
case
involves
absolutely
nothing.
no
predatory
practices
of
any
means,
nothing
in
the
world
except
the
acquisition
and
enforcement
of
this
one
patent
to
protect
its
machines.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
none
whatever.
the
evidence
is
clear
that
there
was
nothing
about
it.
there
is
not
even
any
claim
of
any
predatory
practice
of
any
kind,
price
control,
division
to
territories,
anything.
this
case
is
solely
a
case
of
the
acquisition
of
a
patent
by
singer
to
enforce
that
particular
patent.
now
the
background
for
that
too
is
rather
important.
this
machine
and
this
mechanism
was
actually
invented
by
johnson,
member
of
the
experimental
department
of
singer.
as
is
so
often
the
case,
inventions
come
from
two,
and
three
and
four
people
at
the
same
time.
it
turned
out
that
the
patent
the
singer
had
lost
by
nine
days,
otherwise
it
would
have
and
had
the
patent
on
this
machine
itself.
now
in
the
meantime,
this
was
to
be
its
prime
machine.
it
had
spent
$9
million
on
it
by
1959.
in
1959,
45%
of
its
entire
sewing
machine
revenue
came
from
this
machine.
there
is
nothing
unusual
to
buy
the
patent
that
someone
else
has
just
beaten
them
too
from
nine
days
that
covers
squarely
the
mechanism
in
that
in
order
to
protect
that
mechanism.
and
i
just
cannot
believe,
i
don't
think
i've
ever
heard
it
said
that
there
was
no
predatory
practice,
it
wasn't
a
question
of
trying
to
exclude
competitors
or
try
to
exclude
other
kind
of
machines
and
the
court
found,
that's
another
finding
that
the
government
has
faced
with,
the
trial
court
found
that
singer's
sole
interest
was
the
protection
of
its
‘401'
machine.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
for
making
the
same
kind
of
mechanism
that
you
are
making,
that
is
correct.
now,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
for
a
moment
to
the
government's
claim
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
is,
was
it
expressed
at
clear
overwhelming
that
there
was
joint
action
for
a
common
purpose.
now
i
said
when
you
look
at
the
claims
they
are
making,
you'll
find
out
that
they
have
made
everyone
of
them
to
the
trial
court
and
that
the
trial
court
has
found
against
them
in
each
instance.
i
think
first,
just
to
illustrate
this,
a
claim
that
is
basic
to
the
government's
entire
argument.
it
is
that
gegauf
contributed
a
large
sum
through
giving
the
excess
value
of
its
patent
to
singer
on
the
understanding
that
singer
would
then
enforce
that
patent
and
would
thus
cripple
the
japanese,
so
that
the
japanese
couldn't
compete
in
europe.
now
you
will
notice
that
the
objective
was
not
to
protect
gegauf
in
the
united
states.
this
had
been
and
was
the
objective
as
expressed
by
the
government
before
the
trial
court
that
it
was
to
protect
and
help
gegauf
in
the
united
states,
but
it
ran
into
the
situation
that
gegauf
sent
into
the
united
states
just
1,600
machines
in
a
year
1957;
that
he
was
a
small
company
and
expressed
the
philosophy.
he
did
not
want
to
grow.
he
thought
to
pick
up
the
small
companies
and
got
into
difficulty
by
trying
to
always
enlarge
and
enlarge.
he
had
his
tools,
he
had
his
equipment,
they
were
fully
employed,
he
didn't
want
to
get
bigger,
and
that's
his
prime
interest
was
in
europe.
that
sort
of
blew
up
in
the
argument
that
there
was
a
great
motive
and
incentive
for
gegauf
to
enter
into
conspiracy
to
get
the
benefit
in
the
united
states
of
selling
additional
machines.
now
the
government
with
that
finding
there,
and
i
don't
believe
that
one
would
be
inclined
to
reverse
it
or
say
there
was
no
evidence
to
--
substantial
evidence
to
sustain
it,
and
they
realize
that.
they
now
make
quite
a
different
argument.
they
now
say
that
the
objective
was
to
cripple
the
whole
sewing
machine
industry
and
japan
so
that
it
couldn't
compete
in
europe.
now
let's
see,
what
this
industry
is
and
how
it's
going
to
cripple
it
and
see
if
we
think
that
the
trial
court
had
no
substantial
basis
for
disregarding
that
claim.
as
i
have
just
said,
japanese
sewing
machine
is
second,
third
or
fourth
for
ten
consecutive
years
as
the
biggest
exporters.
all
the
machines,
infringing
machines
set
into
the
united
states
in
the
years
1957
and
1958
represented
1.8,
2.4
and
1.8
of
the
total
exports
of
sewing
machines
in
japan
throughout
the
world.
furthermore,
if
–
would
have
enforced
the
patent
completely,
that
doesn't
mean
that
even
that
percentage
would
have
been
lost
or
they
have
been
crippled,
because
they
can
just
as
easily
make
non-infringing
machines
as
they
have.
in
1957
they
didn't
make
a
single
non-infringing
machine.
in
1958,
over
8%
of
their
imports
of
the
multicam
machines
were
non-infringing.
in
1952,
they
were
59,
they
were
32%,
and
the
number
imported
of
non-infringing
was
500%
of
the
number
that
had
been
imported
in
the
year
before.
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
they
can't
manufacture
non-infringing
machines,
they
are
on
the
market.
in
fact
the
japanese
are
manufacturing
and
importing
as
mr.
friedman
conceded
on
friday.
therefore,
we
have
the
spectacle
of
gegauf
being
inspired
in
the
disagreement
not
to
keep
these
particular
machines
going
to
europe,
that
didn't
help
the
government
and
he
was
afraid.
one
of
his
objections
to
this
agreement
was
that
the
machines
imported
in
the
united
states
might
be
sent
to
europe.
that
has
some
velocity
backup,
but
that
wouldn't
help
the
government,
because
that's
no
motive
for
gegauf
to
go
into
an
agreement.
gegauf
would
have
been
hurt
by
that,
so
the
government
has
to
find
something
better
than
that
and
it
finds
that
the
motive
was
to
injure
or
as
it
puts
it
cripple
the
sewing
machine
industry.
it
says
that
gegauf
gave
excess
value.
the
excess
value
it
says
was
a
magnificent
value
of
this
patent
over
and
above
what
singer
paid
for
out
of
$90,000.
what's
its
evidence
of
this
value?
his
evidence
is
that
gegauf,
when
it
first
started
suggested
that
they
would
like
to
have
$1
million.
when
they
put
the
document
and
evidence
and
showed
that,
the
trial
court
said,
well,
we
think
may
be
as
new
york
counsel
suggested
that
you
ask
for
million
dollars
and
see
what
you
could
get.
well,
it
was
not
without
pressure
that
we
put
in
a
letter
later
showing
that,
that
is
just
almost
exactly
what
happened,
you
can
just
see
it
from
the
latter
complaint.
trial
court's
reaction
to
that
it
didn't
bother
the
government.
it
decided
that
the
gegauf
had
said
to
singer.
when
it
was
asking
singer
$125,000
for
the
patent,
well
we
can
get
many
times
$125,000
each
year,
gegauf
sells
to
patent
to
singer
in
trying
to
get
singer's
pricing.
so,
the
government
accepts
gegauf
as
its
valuation
expert
and
attributes
this
tremendous
value
to
it,
and
so
argues
that
gegauf
contributed
a
tremendous
valuable
patent
far
in
excess
of
the
$90,000
paid
for
it,
in
order
to
get
singer
to
enforce
the
patent,
cripple
the
whole
sewing
machine
industry
in
japan,
less
than
1.8%
of
their
exports.
now
the
government
and
the
trial
court
dealt
with
that
in
its
reference
to
probably
the
counsels
have
suggested
it
to
do
it.
with
reference
to
one
additional
item
it
maybe
an
express
finding,
that
the
fact
that
it
sold
a
series.
in
fact
that
in
two
years,
the
government
pointed
out
in
two
years,
singer
got
a
considerable
amount
of
money
out
of
this,
almost
twice,
so
just
about
twice
what
it
paid
for.
the
government
--
the
trial
court
dealt
with
this
argument.
it
said
the
fact
that
in
two
years
singer
received
almost
twice
as
much
from
sears
roebuck
licenses
gegauf
collected
from
the
sale
of
its
patent
to
singer,
does
not
buttress
the
conclusion
gone
with
the
government,
that
gegauf
was
willing
to
part
with
a
valuable
property
right
at
a
low
price
in
exchange
for
action
for
by
singer
against
their
common
competitors.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that
is
1706,
1707.
now
the
government
stands
before
this
court
and
just
it
either
asked
that
defining
that,
that
is
no
substantial
evidence,
no
substantial
evidence
supporting
the
trial
court
or
in
the
alternative,
and
i'm,
not
sure
which,
that
the
trial
court
thought
all
these
facts
were
so
convincing,
just
as
the
government
does,
but
didn't
understand
that
you
could
have
an
implied
win.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
for
the
government's
contention
whatever.
now
another
point
–-
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
sears
roebuck
was
the
only
licensee.
there
was,
call
your
attention
to
one
point,
i
would
mention
later
if
i
get
to
it
and
i
doubt.
there
was
a
right
in
gegauf
to
permit
one
company
in
japan
to
shift
machines
into
the
united
states,
in
germany
to
ship
machines
to
pfaff,
to
ship
machines
into
the
united
states,
he
never
gave
that
right,
nothing
is
ever
done
about
it
except
to
eliminate
it
from
the
contract
at
a
later
date,
that
is
one
of
the
--
another
one
of
the
facts
that
the
government
relies
upon
and
i'll
refer
to
it
in
just
one
minute.
the
government
as
another
one
of
its
facts
that
it
wants
this
to
court
to
act
upon,
is
that
there
were
some
kind
of
a
--
i
don't
know
what
to
call
it,
whether
to
call
it
a
phantom
agreement
or
some
kind
of
an
obligation,
but
they
can
see
that
there
is
no
agreement
express
or
implied
and
yet
they
say
that
singer
was
so
bound
to
gegauf
by
some
kind
of
an
obligation
that
he
couldn't
possibly
license
singer,
couldn't
license
without
getting
gegauf's
consent.
now
how
they
worked
that
out
at
the
time
that
they
concede
that
there
was
no
agreement
expressed
or
implied,
and
i
don't
know
but
they
do,
and
they
were
very
dramatic
about
it
before
the
trial
court
and
said
to
the
trial
court,
singer,
talking
about
the
double
cross,
he
said,
singer
couldn't
pull
a
stunt
like
that
and
the
trial
court
leaned
over
said,
why
couldn't
it?
they're
in
business
to
make
an
honest
dollar,
by
honest
legitimate
means.
therefore
he
ended
completely
their
philosophy
that
there
was
any
acquisition
or
any
obligation
whatever
not
to
license.
the
trial
court
expressly
found
that
there
was
no
restraint
whatever
upon
singer's
right
to
license.
now
in
another
point,
another
place
in
the
government's
brief
where
it
is
riding
on
another
point,
it
expressly
states
that
there
is
no
restraint
upon
the
right
of
either
to
license
and
yet
it
stands
before
this
court
when
it's
arguing
on
one
point,
it
argues
that
there
was
a
restrain
on
licensing
which
the
trial
court
found
just
to
the
contrary.
on
the
cross
agreement
this
is
another
that
they
argue
shows
cooperation.
when
singer
--
after
singer
brought
its
tariff
commission
action.
the
tariff
commission
asked
whether
there
were
any
licenses
and
singer
explained
the
sears
roebuck
license
and
why
it
had
given
it.
and
i
might
say
incidentally
that
the
reason
for
that
is
the
tariff
commission
doesn't
like
to
ask
--
act
as
just
an
enforcement
agency.
if
you're
going
to
license
your
patent
well
go
ahead
and
do
it,
but
if
you're
going
to
protect
yourself
and
be
--
and
protect
an
industry
and
that
what's
you
say
when
you
go
before
your
tariff
commission,
that
you
were
there
to
protect
an
industry
from
unfair
competition
and
one
of
the
methods
of
unfair
competition
is
to
use
your
patents,
infringing
--
your
patents
and
then
sell
infringing
patents
to
the
products
–
suggestion
to
the
competition.
the
government
--
the
tariff
commission
asked
this
question,
singer
explained
the
circumstances
under
which
it
had
granted
the
license
to
sears
roebuck.
they
ask
whether
there
was
--
whether
pfaff
had
a
license
because
the
facts
the
agreements
where
there
to
show
this
arrangement
with
gegauf.
singer
said
that
it
did
not,
but
after
all
singer
couldn't
be
the
final
word
on
that
because
gegauf
was
the
final
one
and
although
it
hadn't
been
permitted
yesterday,
it
could
be
permitted
today
or
tomorrow.
it
wrote
gegauf
a
letter
asking
gegauf
if
he
would
eliminate
the
provision
about
pfaff
from
the
agreement.
the
government
first
uses
singer's
--
the
finding
about
singer's
motive
in
doing
that
was
to
help
it
in
the
tariff
commission
proceeding.
it
converts
that
into
a
finding
that
that's
the
reason
gegauf
ultimately
did
it,
but
i
just
point
out
the
finding
was
that,
that
was
singer'
s
motive
in
write
off,
not
that
it
was
gegauf's
motive
in
agreement.
gegauf
ultimately
agreed,
but
through
exercise
first
of
a
bludgeoning
power
over
singer.
and
the
license
agreement
then
entered
into
between
them,
gegauf
suggested
that
the
provision
be
put
in
that
they
would
disclose
on
execution
of
the
agreement
any
previous
licenses
or
arrangement
that
had
been
made
with
respect
to
the
patents.
this
was
gegauf's
idea.
gegauf
had
outstanding
a
license
to
phoenix
in
germany.
he
didn't
disclose
it
to
singer.
he
didn't
disclose
it
when
singer
purchased
the
patent.
it
was
a
very
broad
license
applying
to
any
of
the
rights,
any
of
these
patents.
there
was
an
argument
that
gegauf
made
and
possible
to
sustain
it
depending
upon
the
intention
of
the
parties,
that
it
applied
only
to
germany
but
if
you
read
the
wording
you
wouldn't
think
so.
so
finding
himself
in
a
position
where
singer
now
needed
something
from
him,
he
took
advantage
of
it
to
compel
singer
to
indemnify
him
from
any
liability
that
he
might
have
incurred
by
selling
this
patent
to
the
singer
and
bear
in
mind
he
sold
it
without
telling
singer
about
this
outstanding
license.
he
then
demanded
that
singer
give
him
indemnification
from
any
liability
whatever
to
phoenix.
singer
obviously
was
annoyed,
but
it
had
no
choice
and
it
entered
into
an
indemnification
agreement
that
was
protected
from
any
claim
against
phoenix.
now
when
you
see
all
these
backgrounds
that
doesn't
--
this
background,
it
doesn't
show
this
willing
[inaudible]
standing
by
waiting
to
jump
in
and
help
singer,
when
he
did
it,
he
did
it
on
his
own
terms.
and
the
trial
court
considered
this
whole
affair,
it's
written
its
opinion
about
it
and
it's
what
it
finds,
is
further
evidence
that
the
arms
length
dealing
which
it
characterized
all
singer's
dealings
with
gegauf.
now
here
is
again
a
very
contrast
between
what
the
court
finds
and
what
the
government
is
now
urging
this
court
to
go
into
and
find
just
the
reverse,
and
it
has
just
item
after
item,
in
which
that
kind
of
a
thing
is
asked
to
this
court,
and
when
you
look
at
them,
you
not
only
will
prove
i
believe
that
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
there
is
no
substantial
evidence
supporting
it.
i
don't
see
how
the
conclusion
could
be
other
than
what
the
trial
court
found
itself,
even
if
the
decision
was
to
be
de
novo.
the
government
on
the
law
point
argues
that
there
is
a
joint
effort,
joint
purpose
and
it
uses
mostly
the
parallelism
cases.
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
there
is
no
question
of
any
parallel
action
here.
gegauf
first
owned
this
application
and
when
it
owned
it,
it
was
free
to
do
with
it
whatever
it
wanted
to.
there
was
no
economic
power
forcing
gegauf,
there
were
no
economic
power
gegauf
enforcing
singer.
when
singer
acquired
the
patent,
it
was
free
to
what
it
wanted
to
do
with
it.
this
is
not
a
question
of
competing
patents.
it's
a
question
of
competing
applicants
for
the
same
patent
and
with
the
winner
being
willing
to
sell
that
patent
to
singer,
because
singer
wanted
it.
now
they
make
great
store
over
the
fact
that
gegauf
anticipated
that
it
would
be
enforced
and
they
say
that
he
didn't
need
an
agreement,
of
course,
he
would
enforce
it.
so
you're
just
as
bad
whether
you
have
an
agreement
or
not.
if
you
buy
a
product
that
can
be
used
only
for
one
purpose
and
you
hope
it
will
be
used
for
that
purpose
that
becomes
joint
action
for
a
common
purpose.
now
i
think
that
the
parke,
davis
case
pretty
clearly
shows
although
the
express
finding
wasn't
on
that
point.
it
shows
that
if
there
is
anything
in
the
world
that's
left
now,
it
is
the
right
of
a
man
to
hope,
if
all
he
does
is
hope
that
people
will
maintain
prices
and
he
does
nothing
what
else,
but
to
state
his
price
and
then
takes
no
other
step,
but
hope
that
they
will
do
it,
he
is
not
violating
the
law.
it
takes
some
kind
of
an
action
to
tackle
that
before
there
is
any
violation.
and
i
think
that
applies
here,
and
that's
in
price
maintenance,
which
is
a
far
more
touchy
situation
and
an
unreasonable
or
reasonable
restraint
with
the
acquisition
of
the
patent.
there
is
no
economic
power
here
of
either
of
these
parties
over
the
other
and
i
think
the
government
is
faced
with
the
fact
that
if
it's
dealing
with
a
conspiracy
as
distinguished
from
combination,
there
is
no
agreement
of
any
kind
express
or
implied
and
i
think
that
ends
the
conspiracy
portion
of
it.
if
it
is
dealing
with
a
combination
as
distinguished
from
the
conspiracy,
i
think
that
in
every
combination
case
you
will
find
that
there
is
some
element
of
a
power
of
coercion.
you
will
find
two
or
more
people
having
some
power,
economic
or
otherwise,
which
permits
them
without
any
justification
or
any
right
other
than
their
own
power
to
cause
other
people
to
act
in
a
desired
method,
such
as
taking
away
the
merchandise
from
them
or
other
controls
that
you
might
have
owned.
there
is
no
suggestion
even
of
an
economic
power
of
gegauf
over
singer.
singer
had
made
no
agreements,
no
power;
singer
is
free
to
do
what
it
wanted
to.
i
cannot
see
that
a
mere
hope
or
expectation
even
if
it
existed
would
count
as
a
violation
of
the
law.
and
the
fact
is
that
the
trial
court
has
found
that
gegauf
had
no
interest
in
the
united
states
market,
so
even
the
concept
of
a
hope
or
an
expectation
is
entirely
beside
the
point
and
it
is
not
correct
and
the
court
has
found
against
it.
it
found
expressly
that
gegauf's
interest
was
in
europe
and
was
not
in
the
united
states.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
it
get
involves
and
i
think
what
you
are
probably
talking
about
is
the
ability
to
take
information
from
two
cams
at
the
same
time.
that
is
in
the
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
well
i
suppose
that's
the
right
way
of
saying
it.
it
is
an
addition,
it
is
different;
it's
not
in
the
gegauf
patent.
that
was
intended
along
with
johnson
at
the
same
time
the
other
--
it's
all
part
of
one
mechanism
and
his
invention
covered
two
features.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that's
right,
the
major
part
of
the
patent
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
i
don't
quite
understand
the
question,
i
answered
it
this
way.
the
japanese
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
no,
indeed,
no
indeed.
it
had
acquired
--
there
was
the
gegauf
that
is
just
one
claimant.
it
was
the
claim
for
this
multi-cam
mechanism
that
is
in
there,
the
static
cams,
a
cam
follower,
it
can
be
retracted;
it
can
manually
be
shifted
to
select
one
cam
from
the
other.
that
was
the
same
idea
that
was
in
vigorelli,
the
same
idea
that
was
in
gegauf,
the
same
idea
that
was
in
johnson.
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
gegauf
patent
whatever.
so
the
answer
i
think
to
your
question
is
that
singer
obtained
no
power
to
do
anything
other
than
stop
the
manufacturing
of
the
precise
mechanism
that
johnson
had
invented
and
was
incorporated
in
the
singer
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
if
the
gegauf's
patent
had
never
existed,
they
would
have
had
the
same
concept
in
their
harris
patent
that
mr.
friedman
conceded.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
the
same
machine,
i
mean
it
would
have
been,
that
will
be
the
same
singer,
if
you
exclude
a
machine
that
has
the
stack
of
cams
with
a
single
cam
follower
retractable
and
movable.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that
is--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that
is
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
exactly
right,
there
is
no
--
it
could
not
exclude
any
other
type
of
machine
and
no
one
ever
was
made
to
exclude
any
other
type
of
machines
and
singer
had
no
desire
to
exclude
the
patent.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
gegauf
added
nothing
to
the
singer
mechanism.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
nothing
whatever.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
nothing
whatever.
gegauf
was
the
simple
claim
based
on
this
one
mechanism
--
i'm
telling
you
why
and
how
clear
that
is
true.
gegauf
claim
came
from
the
singer
harris
patent.
now
singer
drew
its
claim
covering
this
mechanism
of
the
single
cam
products,
stack
and
cams
with
single
follower.
that
claim
was
taken
word-for-word
and
suggested
to
gegauf
and
when
gegauf
had
the
nine-day
hire
order,
it
got
the
precise
claim
and
you
can
see
them
in
the
--
i
think
it
was
133
which
is,
we
have
set
forth
in
the
record.
there
is
the
tabulation
that
shows
how
these
claims
go
just
word-for-word
and
what
happened
is
and
i
say
this
is
a
competition
for
the
same
claim,
it
is
not
competing
patents.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that
is
exactly,
i
cannot
see
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that's
right.
i
will
go
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
absolutely,
there
is
no
point
in
getting
the
patent,
so
now
they
will
pay
$90,000
and
get
a
patent
and
not
use
it,
that's
how
much
stands
for
that.
now
i
will
go
further,
i
never
like
to
take
the
point
to
this
and
true
in
the
case,
but
i
would
say
that
if
gegauf
and
singer
had
sat
down
at
a
table,
had
talked
this
whole
thing
over,
had
concluded
that
singer
could
do
a
better
job
than
gegauf
and
had
entered
into
a
written
agreement
under
which
gegauf
would
sign
its
patent
to
singer
and
singer
would
agree
to
enforce
the
patent.
now
i'm
leaving
out
of
this
any
restrictions
on
licensing.
singer
would
agree
to
enforce
the
patent.
there
is
nothing
whatever
that
will
be
illegal
with
it.
from
time
immemorial
the
owner
of
the
patent
has
agreed
to
enforce
it.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
owner
of
the
patent
shouldn't
agree
to
enforce
it.
otherwise
anyone
is
paying
a
license
is
just
paying
license
while
they
let
other
people
go
and
use
it
free
in
charge.
i
don't
know
the
lawyer
has
drawn
any
license
agreements
that
hasn't
put
in
agreement
that
one
party
or
the
other
will
enforce
the
patent.
now
as
long
as
50
years
ago
in
that
vertube
case,
this
court
decided
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
the
owner
of
a
patent
conveying
it
to
and
in
having
and
reserving
license
and
then
having
the
new
owner
agree
to
enforce
a
patent.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
that's
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
frankly
and
you
ask
whether
they
were
competitors,
i
do
not
know.
in
case
cited
on
page
125
of
our
brief,
but
i
would
not
see
that
it
makes
slightest
difference
on
it,
because
after
all
if
the
manufacture
--
if
the
owner
of
the
patent
can
license
a
competitor,
it
seems
to
follow
that
he
not
only
has
a
right
to
it,
but
he
is
almost
obligated
to
enforce
it.
and
i
would
see
it
wouldn't
make
the
slightest
difference
that
if
he
found
the
other
fellow
was
a
better
enforcer,
that
he
could
convey
it
him
and
ask
him
to
enforce
the
patent,
because
after
the
object
of
the
patent
is
to
give
a
monopoly,
that's
all
it
is.
that's
the
subject
matter
that's
covered
for
that
particular
patent.
the
very
purpose
is
to
give
the
monopoly
and
as
long
there
is
nothing
wrong
in
the
license,
certainly
there
can
be
nothing
wrong
in
agreeing
to
enforce
the
patent
so
that
the
licensee
can
get
the
benefit
of
it.
and
i
cannot
see
any
possible
argument
that
would
prevent
a
person
from
owning
a
patent,
transferring
it
to
his
licensee
because
the
licensee
could
enforce
it
better.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
financial
strength
is
the
one
that
determines
who
is
the
one
that
agrees
to
enforce
it
time
after
time,
it's
almost
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
yes
i
suppose
that
it
is
an
acquisition
of
an
asset
of
the
competitors.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
right,
not
much
of
a
competitor.
now
i
think
this
competitive
business
can
be
overdone
by
just
not
realizing
what
the
facts
are.
gegauf
wasn't
much
of
a
competitor.
gegauf
sent
into
this
country
1,600
machines.
singer
was
selling
at
the
rate
of
150,000
machines
a
year.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
before
he
got
the
license.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
before
he
got
the
license.
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
well
that
would
be
true
whether
it's
competitor
or
not,
i
mean
competitor
or
non-competitor
could
have
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
yes
but
--
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
you
got
a
patent
on
a
mechanism
that
would
have
been
very
embarrassing
for
singer
if
it
hadn't
got
the
license
on
it.
that
is
certainly,
and
that's
one
reason
that
it
worked
so
hard
to
get
it.
now
after
that,
came
the
acquisition
of
the
patent.
finally
i
would
like
to
just
--
two
minutes
i
may
have,
if
that's
what
it
is,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
trial
court
also
went
into
the
market
and
found
that
this
machine
competes
not
only
with
multiple
cam
machines,
but
it
competes
with
all
kinds
of
machines,
replacing
cam
machines,
manually
operated
machines,
straight
stitch
with
the
zigzag
attachments
on
it.
there
is
nothing
unreasonable
in
restraint
of
this,
if
in
all
other
respects,
the
enforcement
of
this
patent
was
felt
someway
subject
to
restraint,
which
i
think
it
is
not.
still
the
market
here
is
such
a
small
portion
of
the
market
in
which
it
competes
that
i
think
if
you
would
even
find
a
relevant
market
basis
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
in
this
small
portion
of
market.
it's
in
the
testimony
compared
to
all
the
machines,
and
finally,
bear
in
mind
that
this
whole
machine
is
a
sewing
machine.
this
should
not
be
conceived
off
as
a
zigzag
sewing
machine.
this
machine
is
used
and
testimony
shows
that
90%
for
sewing.
it
would
like
saying
that
an
automobile
with
a
heater
was
for
the
purpose
of
getting
warm.
now
the
machine
is
to
sew
it
and
straight
stitch
and
90%
of
all
the
sewing
is
done
on
this
machine
is
straight
stitch.
the
pattern
companies
do
not
even
issue
patterns
with
the
zigzag
designs.
i
mean
all
the
patterns
companies,
if
you
go
to
pattern
companies
you
get
patterns
for
dresses
they
are
all
straight
stitch.
this
is
a
--
this
is
just
a
little
pricing
thing,
that
is
at
sales
point,
a
good
sales
point,
but
it
doesn't
convert
it
from
a
sewing
machine.
it's
still
fundamentally
and
entirety
a
sewing
machine
and
it's
used
for
that
purpose.
it's
insignificant
in
the
making
of
dresses
by
the
way.
thank
you.
should
i
just
answer
mr.
justice
harlan
as
to
where
this
testimony
is?
mr.
arthur
e.
pettit
it
begins
at
r-502.
