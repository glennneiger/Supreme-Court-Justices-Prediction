mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
a
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
dismissing
after
trial,
a
government
antitrust
case
against
the
singer
manufacturing
company.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
government
had
failed
to
prove
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy
charge
and
of
the
government’s
other
contention
with
respect
to
a
certain
agreement
is
being
an
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade
have
not
been
established.
the
principal
question
in
the
case
is
whether
certain
actions
taken
by
the
appellee,
singer
and
a
competing
swiss
manufacturer
of
sewing
machines,
a
company
called
gegauf,
by
which
a
key
patent
governing
the
particular
type
of
machine
involved
here
was
transferred
from
the
swiss
company
gegauf
to
the
singer
company
because
both
parties
believed
that
singer
would
be
better
able
to
enforce
this
patent
against
the
common
competitive
enemy
of
both,
japanese
manufacturers
of
sewing
machines
that
was
selling
them
in
this
country
for
lower
prices,
whether
this,
together
with
subsequent
action
that
the
two
took
to
enforce
the
patent,
a
matter
to
an
illegal
conspiracy
and
combination
and
restraint
of
trade.
there's
a
second
issue
in
the
case
which
is
whether
a
provision
in
the
cross-licensing
agreement
that
singer
and
the
swiss
firm,
gegauf
entered
into
by
which
each
party
agreed
to
facilitate
the
allowance
to
the
other
of
the
broadest
possible
patent
claims,
its
self-constituted
and
unreasonable
restraint
of
trade.
now,
this
case
involves
a
particular
type
of
household
sewing
machines,
something
called
the
machine-carried
multiple
cam
zigzag
machine.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
sir.
i'll
--
i'll
call
it
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'm
afraid
not,
mr.
justice.
i
can't
operate
a
sewing
machine,
but
the
wonderful
thing
about
this
machine,
the
zigzag
type
of
sewing
machine
is
that
without
any
particular
skill
by
the
operator,
the
housewife
can
make
the
most
remarkable
patterns,
these
so-called
zigzag
patterns.
i
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i'm
afraid
not.
if
i
could
sew,
if
i
could
operate
a
sewing
machine,
i
can
do
that.
i
have
here
the
first
one,
i
don't
know
whether
the
court
can
see
it,
these
are
some
of
the
patterns
made
on
the
particular
machine
involving
this
case.
the
court
will
notice
in
contradistinction
to
the
usual
straight
stitch,
these
--
there's
all
sorts
of
zigzags.
one
goes
up,
has
a
die,
up
and
down
and
so
forth.
i
also
--
this
is
part
of
the
record
in
the
case,
i
also
have
another
one
not
made
on
this
machine
but
made
on
a
more
advanced
italian
machine
which
i
brought
here
because
the
stitches
are
much
larger
and
also
much
more
reliable.
and
i'll
hold
this
up
to
the
court,
you'll
notice
that
really
quite
remarkable
stitches
that
can
be
done.
and
under
this
type
of
a
machine
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
is
one
of
the
vigorelli
machines,
an
advance
vigorelli
machine,
not
the
one
that
was
the
subject
matter
of
this
particular
situation.
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
are
not
--
no,
we
are
not
attacking
at
all
the
arrangement
with
vigorelli.
we
are
not
attacking
the
cross-licensing
agreement
itself
between
singer
and
gegauf.
we
are
attacking
the
provision
to
facilitate
the
broadest
possible
patent
claims.
we
are
attacking
the
transfer
of
the
patent
and
we
are
attacking
the
subsequent
actions,
the
latter
three,
the
latter
two
and
three
as
elements
of
the
overall
illegal
conspiracy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
gegauf.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
differences
--
you
mean,
why
we're
not
attacking
vig
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
can
put
--
state
very
simply.
in
the
case
of
the
arrangements
with
vigorelli,
it
was
just
a
cross-licensing.
it
was
not
a
transfer
of
the
patent.
in
addition
to
that,
the
--
our
arrangement
with
vigorelli
was
not
in
terms
of
an
agreement
to
facilitate
the
allowance
of
the
broadest
possible
patent
claims.
it
was
an
agreement
merely
to
settle
interference
proceedings
before
the
patent
office.
and
finally,
the
reason
we're
not
attacking
it
here
is
we
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
record
that
establishes
that
the
agreement
with
vigorelli
in
anyway
related
to
an
attempt
to
exclude
the
japanese
competitors.
that's
the
basic
reason,
i
believe.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
--
mr.
justice,
we
think
there's
two
aspects
of
the
case
as
i
shall
develop.
at
the
point
that
singer
entered
into
the
cross-licensing
agreements,
both
with
vigorelli
and
with
gegauf,
at
this
point
singer
was
concerned
that
the
machine
which
it
had
been
developing
might
be
infringing
these
patents
and
it
wanted
to
free
itself
from
the
threat
of
being
an
infringer.
it
was,
if
i
may
use
the
phrase,
this
was
a
defensive
alliance,
an
attempt
to
protect
themselves
so
they
could
make
their
own
machine,
but
when
you
get
to
the
situation
which
forms
the
guts,
if
i
may
say,
of
this
case,
singer
shifted
from
the
defensive
to
the
offensive.
singer
then
begun
its
campaign
not
to
ensure
itself
protection
that
it
could
manufacture
free
of
the
threat
of
infringement
by
gegauf
but
it
begun
this
--
went
--
entered
into
this
joint
program
we
think
with
gegauf,
to
enable
it
to
exclude
its
competitors.
note,
in
the
one
hand,
it
was
going
against
its
competitors,
in
the
--
situation
which
your
honors
alluded,
it
was
attempting
to
protect
itself.
now,
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice.
i
don't
think
so.
we
have,
i
think
no
basic
quarrel
with
our
opponents
as
to
what
was
done
in
this
case
and
my
statement
of
the
case
will
be
based
on
the
documentary
evidence
and
upon
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
one
or
two
minor
exceptions.
we
don't
of
course
accept
the
ultimate
finding
that
there
was
no
conspiracy
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
one
or
two
minor
exceptions,
we
do
accept
the
findings,
but
we
think
that
findings
and
the
undisputed
documentary
evidence
point
to
the
contrary
conclusion
to
that
reached
by
the
district
court.
now,
i
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice.
if
that
were
all
we
had
in
this
case,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
we
recognize
of
course
that
what
a
patent
gives
you
is
the
right
to
exclude,
that's
what
the
patent
law
say
a
patent
did.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
you
may
buy
another
patent
and
presumably,
when
you
buy
another
patent,
one
of
the
things
you
are
buying
is
the
right
to
exclude.
we
recognize
that
and
if
all
we
had
in
this
case
was
that
singer
acquired
the
gegauf
patent
and
it
did
it
because
it
wanted
to
use
it
against
the
japanese,
we
would
not
contend
that
applies.
but
we
contend
here
that
we
are
far
more
than
that.
we
don't
just
have,
as
i
shall
develop,
the
simple
purchase
in
sale,
a
simple
transaction.
here,
we
think
here,
a
joint
program.
here,
we
have
a
series
of
relationships
between
them,
all
directed
to
this
common
aim.
now,
i'd
just
like
to
indicate
briefly
since
there
would
be
some
discussion
here
as
to
precisely
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
this
thing
that
i
hold
before
me,
this
model,
is
a
model
of
the
key
mechanism
involved
in
the
patent
of
this
case.
this
is
the
multiple
cam
device.
the
court
will
notice
that
there
is
on
this
side
of
the
device
a
series
of
metal
discs
or
cams,
and
the
outside
of
each
one
of
these
has
different
protrusions
of
different
sizes
and
different
shapes.
there's
also
attached
to
this
a
little
finger-like
called
a
cam
follower
which
can
be
moved
from
one
cam
to
the
other.
as
this
revolves,
the
cam
follower
bounces
back
and
forth
following
the
configurations
of
the
cam.
and
this
movement
is
transmitted
by
a
mechanism
to
the
needle.
and
the
result
of
this
is
that
as
the
cam
goes
around
and
it's
transmitted,
the
needle,
while
it's
going
up
and
down
at
the
same
time
is
moving
laterally
back
and
forth.
and
that's
how
the
zigzag
stitches
are
made.
it
goes
in
effect
like
this,
up
and
down.
and
the
beauty
of
this
device
is
this
machine
carried
the
cams,
all
being
together
here
that
the
housewife
may
select
a
large
variety
of
patterns
by
the
simple
expedient
of
turning
dials
and
selecting
one
cam
or
the
other.
and
there
shall
here
before
the
court,
this
is
a
model
of
the
machine.
the
cams
are
in
here
and
now
they
can
see
it.
in
here,
it's
transmitted
to
the
needle
here
which
goes
up
and
down,
and
with
zigzags
from
side
to
side
laterally
as
the
cloth
is
going
through.
now,
the
singer
company
at
the
present
time
is
the
sole
american
manufacturer
of
this
multicam
machine-carried
machines
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
with
one
--
with
one
minor
exemption,
yes
and
this
particular
type
of
machine
in
the
year
1959
represented
about
45%
of
singer's
total
sales
of
household
sewing
machines
in
the
united
states,
roughly
about
$45
million.
now,
before
turning
to
the
facts,
i
would
like
to
discuss
one
matter
which
in
a
sense
is
lurking
in
this
case.
singer
makes
a
great
deal
of
the
fact
that
in
the
sewing
machine
industry,
the
japanese
manufacturers
have
made
a
remarkable
achievement
in
getting
into
the
american
market.
it
points
out
that
the
japanese
have
been
vigorous
competitors,
that
they
have
now
gained
a
major
share
of
the
american
market.
that
they
are
undercutting
prices
and
that
other
manufacturers
in
america
of
sewing
machines
are
going
out
of
business.
and
from
these
facts,
singer
suggests
that
what
it
did
was
permissible
here
because
it
was
done
to
protect
an
american
industry.
as
it
puts
it
in
these
circumstances,
any
restraint
it
imposes
is
not
an
unreasonable
restraint.
we
think
that
the
answer
to
this
is
that
the
antitrust
laws
do
not
permit
american
manufacturer
to
justify,
otherwise
illegal
conduct
because
of
the
fact
that
this
is
done
to
protect
it
from
foreign
competition.
the
sherman
act
permits
as
designed
to
protect
both
domestic
and
foreign
competition.
and
if
in
fact,
as
a
matter
of
national
policy,
it
is
considered
desirable
that
some
steps
should
be
taken
in
order
to
protect
this
american
industry
from
foreign
competition,
this
is
not
the
way
to
do
it.
there
are
other
ways
to
deal
with
this
problem,
particularly
under
the
tariff
act.
it
may
also
be
dealt
with
--
through
international
agreements
doing
action
by
the
executive
branch.
but
we
don't
think
the
fact
that
the
lower
priced
japanese
machines
are
making
serious
inroads
into
business
of
the
american
companies,
justifies
in
any
way
what
singer
has
done
in
this
case
in
an
attempt
to
proceed
and
to
stop
this
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
they
do,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh,
sure
--
surely
not.
each
--
we
say
a
competitor
should
compete
as
vigorously
as
possible,
as
vigorously
as
possible.
if
singer
is
able
to
undersell
the
japanese
firm,
if
singer
can
manufacture
a
better
machine,
the
customers
feel
that
despite
their
higher
prices,
they
prefer
the
singer
machine
as
this
time,
we
do
say
that
this
american
company
and
its
swiss
competitor
cannot
enter
into
a
joint
course
of
dealing
for
the
purpose
of
using
their
combined
power
against
the
japanese.
now
the
--
i
like
now
to
turn
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
story
that
we
are
going
to
tell
basically
fits
into
three
phases.
the
first
phase
involves
the
cross-licensing
agreement
between
singer
and
gegauf.
the
second
phase
involves
the
transfer
of
the
patent
from
gegauf
to
singer
and
the
third
phase
involves
certain
actions
the
parties
took
after
the
transfer.
the
background
of
the
case
is
just
quite
simple.
in
late
1955
and
early
1956,
singer
company
had
pending
before
the
united
states
patent
office
an
application
basically
the
four
gadgets
that
i've
shown
the
court
earlier
covering
machine-carried
multiple
cams
which
it
hoped
would
be
granted
and
which
will
protect
this
machine
which
had
already
developed
and
which
was
then
in
the
process
of
towing
up
to
manufacture.
in
1955,
it
had
settled
certain
patent
disputes
with
the
italian
firm,
vigorelli,
by
entering
into
a
cross-licensing
with
it.
and
it
had
reason
to
believe
that
its
patent
application
which
is
known
as
the
harris
patent
would
have
priority
in
the
united
states
over
the
applications
filed
by
other
manufacturers.
in
january
1956,
it
learned
to
its
great
consternation
that
the
gegauf
company
had
on
file
a
patent
application
in
the
united
states
which
had
a
priority
date,
nine
days
earlier
than
the
singer
application.
and
it
was
of
the
view
that
if
this
matter
came
to
a
head,
the
chances
are
that
gegauf
would
prevail
over
it.
it
was
afraid
that
--
it
was
informed
that
its
application
was
ready
for
issuance
and
it
was
afraid
that
when
the
patent
office
came
to
examine
its
application
preliminary
to
issuance,
they
would
quickly
discover
that
the
gegauf
patent
was
also
pending,
covering
the
same
invention.
and
that
they
would
then
be
what
the
patent
office
describes
as
an
interference
proceeding
which
is
a
proceeding
by
which
the
patent
office
determines
which
of
two
competing
applicants
for
a
patent
claim
is
the
first
inventor
and
therefore
entitled
to
the
invention.
and
it
was
afraid
as
i've
indicated
that
it
would
come
out
second
best
in
this
conflict
with
gegauf.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
this
was
early
in
1956.
in
january
--
it
found
out
in
january
and
it
therefore
decided
to
seek
a
cross-licensing
agreement
with
gegauf
which
would
free
its
machine
from
the
threat
that
gegauf
might
ultimately
obtain
a
patent
which
would
cover
this
machine.
and
in
april
of
1956,
the
cross-licensing
agreement
was
signed.
in
a
contemporaneous
memorandum
written
by
mr.
waterman,
the
vice-president
of
singer
who
conducted
the
negotiations
with
gegauf
explaining
why
this
agreement
was
entered
into,
he
made
the
following
statement,
page
10
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
--
on
page
1062,
mr.
justice.
as
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
second
in
the
sum
--
i'm
sorry,
in
the
second
volume.
it's
government
exhibit
24
and
it's
this
first
full
paragraph
on
page
1062
in
volume
2.
mr.
waterman
said,
gegauf's
big
fear
is
that
the
japanese
machines
coming
into
the
united
states
will
be
sold
at
a
lower
price
than
his
machines
will
be
because
of
their
low
price
labor.
i
think
its
fear
is
well
founded
and
we
did
not
do
anything
to
cause
them
to
be
other
than
along
the
line
that
he
was
thinking.
because
one
of
the
strong
points
of
our
argument
for
an
agreement
between
our
two
companies
is
in
order
to
fight
against
this
japanese
competition
and
they're
building
a
machine
that
in
anyway
reads
on
the
patents
of
ourselves
and
of
bernina
and
bernina,
i
might
add
is
the
trade
name
for
gegauf
which
are
in
conflict.
in
other
words,
he
emphasized
that
the
purpose
of
the
agreement
was
in
order
to
fight
against
this
japanese
competition.
then
down
at
the
bottom
of
page
1063
in
the
top
of
1064,
mr.
waterman
also
told
them
that
singer
was
prepared
to
fight
with
them,
they're
going
to
litigate
with
them
if
they
didn't
reach
an
agreement
and
as
he
said
that,
we
left
them
no
doubt
that
we're
going
to
offer
objection
to
the
issuance
of
their
patents,
not
only
in
the
united
states
but
in
other
countries
where
they
have
pending
applications.
and
we
let
them
know
that
we
thought
we
could
knockout
their
claims,
but
then
in
so
doing
we
were
probably
going
to
get
hurt
both
of
us.
the
result
of
this
was
the
cross-licensing
agreement
which
is
set
forth
in
the
following
two
pages
of
the
record
1066
and
1067.
the
actual
cross-licensing
agreement
itself
which
we
are
not
attacking
is
set
forth
in
paragraphs
two
and
three,
and
it
took
the
form
of
an
agreement
by
singer
and
gegauf
not
to
attack
each
other
on
the
basis
of
the
patents
listed
in
the
agreement,
which
included
the
gegauf
patent
application
to
harris
and
certain
others.
in
addition
to
that,
and
we
are
attacking
paragraph
one
of
the
agreement,
contains
two
sentences.
in
the
first
one,
singer
and
gegauf
agreed
not
to
do
anything,
which
might
restrict
each
other's
claims
in
any
country
relating
to
the
subject
matter
of
these
patent
applications.
and
the
second
paragraph,
each
undertook
in
accordance
with
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
patent
office
concerned
to
facilitate
the
allowance
in
any
country
of
claims
as
broad
as
possible
as
regards
the
subject
matter
of
the
patents
and
patent
application
referred
to
above,
in
other
words,
not
just
these
particular
patents
but
the
subject
matter,
the
whole
subject
matter
of
this
machine-carried
multiple
cams.
now,
at
the
time
this
agreement
to
facilitate
the
allowance
to
the
broadest
possible
claims
was
entered
into,
singer
and
gegauf,
as
far
as
this
patent
is
concerned,
were
merely
applicants.
they
didn't
have
this
patent.
at
this
time,
the
japanese
of
course
were
not
infringers
of
any
patent
and
singer,
gegauf
and
the
japanese
all
had
the
equal
right
to
sell
this
machine
in
the
united
states
until
any
patent
issue.
necessarily,
any
broad
patent
which
would
issue,
as
a
result
of
this
agreement,
would
define
the
scope
of
what
conduct
the
competing
japanese
might
engage
and
the
broader
of
the
patent,
the
greater
the
likelihood
of
course
that
more
and
more
of
the
japanese
machines
would
turn
out
to
infringe
this
patent.
and
the
agreements
that
they
made
to
help
each
other
in
obtaining
broad
patents,
we
think,
must
be
considered
in
the
light
of
the
statement
which
i
have
just
read
to
the
court,
that
the
reason
--
one
reason
for
this
agreement
was
to
fight
against
the
japanese
competition.
now,
we
think
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision
is
very
plain.
each
of
these
people
was
concerned
about
the
japanese
competition
they
wanted
to
insure
that
one
or
both
of
them
would
get
the
broadest
possible
patent
which
would
be
the
most
effective
method
for
opposing
the
japanese.
now,
at
the
time
the
that
singer
entered
into
the
cross-licensing
agreement,
the
record
shows
that
it
gave
consideration
to
purchasing
the
gegauf
patent,
decided
not
to
do
it,
however,
for
various
business
reasons.
the
following
week,
singer
met
with
vigorelli
with
whom
it
had
entered
into
a
cross-licensing
the
year
before
and
they
had
a
conversation
with
vigorelli's
lawyer,
who
asked
them
what
the
patent
situation
was
in
the
united
states
and
they
told
vigorelli
that
they'd
entered
into
this
cross-licensing
agreement
but
they're
going
to
have
a
terrible
time
they
thought
gegauf
would
have
a
hard
time
enforcing
it.
and
they
indicated
to
vigorelli's
lawyer
that
they
thought
they
could
do
a
better
job
in
enforcing
this
patent
and
gegauf
could.
vigorelli's
lawyer
asked
whether
they
would
have
any
objection
to
passing
this
information
on
to
gegauf,
singer
replied
he
wouldn't
but
they
wanted
to
be
sure
it
didn't
appear
that
it
was
coming
from
singer.
and
vigorelli's
man
said,
“don't
worry
about
that”
and
this
information
was
passed
on
to
gegauf.
that
was
in
the
spring
of
1956.
that
summer,
mr.
gegauf's
son
came
to
the
united
states
on
a
visit
and
singer
had
a
conference
with
him.
and
young
mr.
gegauf
expressed
to
singer
his
concern
that
he
had
seen
a
great
many
japanese
sewing
machines
in
the
united
states.
singer
in
turn
pointed
out
to
young
mr.
gegauf
that
in
view
of
the
large
number
of
importers,
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
gegauf
to
enforce
this
patent
effectively
against
these
japanese
machines
and
he
asked
--
singer
people
asked
young
gegauf
whether
he
thought
his
father
would
be
interested
in
selling
the
patent
to
singer.
that
was
in
the
summer
of
1956.
early
in
september,
gegauf
wrote
to
singer
in
response
to
this
suggestion,
and
this
letter
is
set
forth
at
page
1079
of
the
record
again
in
volume
2.
it's
a
short
one
page
letter
marked
“confidential”
in
which
after
thanking
the
singer
company
for
the
courtesies
they
had
shown
to
mr.
gegauf,
the
last
paragraph,
gegauf
stated,
“we
agree
that
something
should
be
done
against
japanese
competition
in
your
country
and
maybe
south
america
and
therefore
looking
forward
to
your
early
reply.”
within
two
days,
gegauf
indicated
that
this
was
what
they
had
in
mind
in
the
next
page
of
the
record
at
1080,
singer
replied
--
i'm
sorry,
singer
replied
to
gegauf,
“we
do
believe
it
may
be
possible
that
we
can
both
strengthen
our
positions
with
respect
to
the
japanese
competition
which
you
mention
and
i
hope
that
we
can
again
meet
and
discuss
our
respective
situations.”
they
did
have
a
meet
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
it's
somewhat
different
than
that,
mr.
justice.
our
theory
is
this,
that
there
was
an
overall
conspiracy,
concerted
action
that
these
two
competitors
embarked
in
a
common
course
of
conduct,
the
purpose
of
which
was
to
eliminate
the
japanese
competition.
what
they
did,
what
they
did
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
--
indep
--
no.
the
conspiracy
related,
i
would
say,
to
eliminating
the
japanese
by
the
use
of
the
patent.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
needs.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
no,
no.
to
put
it
back
--
put
to
--
to
handicap
in
as
much
as
possible
as
to
this
--
as
to
this
machine.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
that
would
not,
but
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
say
that
all
of
the
circumstances
have
to
be
looked
at.
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
another,
another
analogy
which
we
think
would
be
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
if
singer
came
to
gegauf
and
said,
“we
are
both
concerned
with
the
japanese
competition
and
something
ought
to
be
done
about
it.”
and
gegauf
said,
“yes”
and
singer
said,
“well
now,
look,
you've
got
a
better
patent
than
we
have
but
you
don't
--
just
can't
enforce
it.
why
don't
you
give
it
to
us
so
that
we
can
enforce
it?”
and
gegauf
said,
“well,
that
seems
like
a
splendid
idea.”
we've
got
some
problems
but
they
finally
negotiated
the
thing
out
and
then
gegauf
--
singer
did
enforce
it
and
gegauf
cooperated
in
this
enforcement
and
we
think
it
--
when
they
did
that,
and
i
think
that's
what
this
record
shows
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
--
but
i
have
to
end
--
i
say
that
that
is
--
that
is
correct
but
that
is
only
part
of
the
story
i
think,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
unless
to
the
--
not
unless
to
the
--
infringed
on
--
in
restraining
american
trade
but
if
co
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
would
--
that's
correct.
but
mr.
justice,
i
have
to
emphasize
and
this
is
i
think
the
key
to
the
case,
when
singer
was
able
to
persuade
gegauf
to
sell
the
patent
to
it,
he
spoke
of
bargaining
about
the
price
but
the
lever
that
singer
used
to
persuade
gegauf
to
sell
was
that
it
was
to
gegauf's
interest
to
have
the
patent
in
singer's
hands
to
enforce
it
against
the
japanese.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
precisely
what
happened.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
does
the
ultimate
finding
--
of
course,
that
there
was
no
conspiracy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
tell
--
may
i
--
i
think
i
can
fairly
state
what
the
district
court
held
here.
the
district
court
held
that
each
of
these
agreements
contained
the
whole
understanding
between
the
parties.
the
court
also
held
that
there
was
no
agreement
at
the
time
of
the
transfer
of
the
patent
that
singer
would
use
it
against
the
japanese.
he
said
these
people
had
an
attitude
of
hostility
and
suspicion.
they
bargain
out
at
arm's
length
and
they
did
nothing
improper.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
didn't
think
--
we
think
we
can
accept
that
mr.
justice
because
we
think
that
even
without
any
express
agreement
that
what
they
did
here
did
amount
to
putting
together
a
combination
in
conspiracy
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
there's
no
need
for
an
express
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
related
to
the
japanese
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
correct
and
our
answer
to
that,
mr.
justice
is
that
the
facts,
the
facts,
the
undisputed
facts
as
shown
by
the
documents
and
as
found
by
the
district
court,
do
show
a
conspiracy
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
course,
of
course,
but
that
we
think
is
a
question
of
law,
mr.
justice.
that's
a
question
of
law
and
not
a
question
of
fact
as
to
which
the
findings
are
supportable,
sustainable
unless
clearly
erroneous.
i'd
like
to
come
back
as
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
i
think
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
are
--
we
do
not
accept
the
district
court's
finding
that
this
was
a
perfectly
legitimate
business
arrangement.
we
do
--
we
do
not
challenge
the
finding
that
there
was
no
agreement,
particular,
specific
agreement
between
the
parties
not
expressed
in
a
written
docu
--
relationships
they
entered
into.
we
say
that
you
don't
have
to
have
such
an
agreement
with
the
joint
course
of
conduct
which
they
entered
into
in
order
to
go
against
the
japanese
as
enough
as
a
matter
of
law
to
establish
a
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
i'd
like
to
just
refer
to
the
basis,
to
the
arguments,
the
way
in
which
singer
was
able
to
persuade
gegauf
to
sell
the
patent
to
it.
we
start
with
a
year
after
they
had
held
their
first
meeting
in
october
at
which
singer
was
unwilling
to
pay
the
$250,000
that
gegauf
had
requested.
there
was
a
series
of
letters
in
which
suggesting
that
now
--
that
the
gegauf
patent
had
issued
--
i'm
sorry,
now
that
the
patents
were
about
to
be
issued
and
that
the
interference
had
been
settled,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
discuss
mutual
enforcement
of
the
patents.
and
throughout
these
discussions,
the
argument
that
singer
made
against
the
transfer
and
in
--
i'm
sorry,
the
argument
that
gegauf
made,
against
the
transfer
and
in
support
of
its
high
price
was
two-fold.
first,
it
said,
“we
can
get
a
lot
more
than
the
$125,000
we're
asking
by
licensing
this
patent.”
singer's
reply
to
that
was,
“don't
look
at
this
as
though
--
treat
this
as
though
this
is
just
the
money
you're
getting
out
of
this.
look
at
this
as
insurance.
look
at
what
we're
doing
for
you.”
secondly,
gegauf
suggested
that
if
singer
did
get
the
patent
and
that
if
singer
did
enforce
it
against
the
japanese
in
the
united
states,
all
that
this
would
do,
would
be
to
drive
the
japanese
to
europe.
and
that
in
europe,
this
would
be
down
to
gegauf's
detriment
and
singer
against
it
on
the
contrary,
on
the
contrary,
we
will
be
able
to
give
the
japanese
such
a
blow
in
this
country
by
enforcing
our
patent
against
them,
you
won't
have
to
worry
about
that.
and
as
the
district
court
found
in
this
case
that
singer
continued
to
drive
home
the
point
that
gegauf
stood
to
benefit
more
by
enforcement
of
the
patents
in
the
united
states
and
it
stood
to
lose
because
the
possible
danger
of
the
japanese
coming
to
europe
and
the
sale
was
made.
now,
we
think
that
when
these
negotiations
are
looked
at
in
the
light
of
the
undisputed
documentary
evidence
and
what
the
court
found,
several
things
are
clear.
first,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
gegauf
was
induced
to
sell
the
patent
to
singer
and
at
this
price
below
what
they
were
asking
because
singer
convinced
gegauf
that
singer
would
be
better
able
to
enforce
this
patent
against
the
japanese
than
gegauf
and
it
was
to
the
mutual
interest
of
both
of
them
that
singer
should
do
it.
it's
also
we
think
quite
clear
that
even
though
there
was
no
expressed
agreement
by
singer
to
enforce
the
patent
against
gegauf
that
both
of
them
understood
that
this
was
precisely
what
was
going
to
be
done,
there
was
no
need
to
enter
into
any
agreement
on
the
part
of
them
that
singer
would
enforce
the
patent.
this
was
the
reason
that
singer
made
quite
clear
they
wanted
to
purchase
the
patent
and
this
was
the
argument
it
used
in
inducing
gegauf
to
sell
it
to
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
think
it
would
be
under
the
terms
of
its
agreement.
i
think
that
gegauf
would
be
terribly
disappointed.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
would
be
contrary
to
the
basic
whole
plan
of
the
arrangements
between
the
parties,
indeed
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
it
was
the
clear
implication
not
alone
was
the
purpose
of
this
thing
weren't
going
to
license
the
japanese.
the
purpose
of
this
whole
course
of
conduct
was
to
go
against
the
japanese.
indeed,
i
think
it's
significant
but
after
the
agreement
was
entered
into
and
the
patent
was
assigned,
singer
licensed
sears
roebuck
to
import
a
machine
from
germany
and
sears
--
they
did
it
because
sears
was
a
good
costumer,
and
sears
paid
singer
substantial
royalties.
and
when
gegauf
found
out
about
it,
it
wrote
to
singer
complaining
because
they
said,
“why
did
you
license
this
other
german
firm,
maybe
sears
would
have
taken
from
us,
you
should
have
given
us
the
opportunity
to
get
that.”
and
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
no.
i
don't
think
there
was
--
had
been
any
agreement
for
breach
of
contract
they
would
have
at
length
but
it
certainly
violates
the
whole
spirit
of
the
relationship
between
them
and
the
purpose
which
they
entered
into
this.
i'd
like
also
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
a
letter
that
gegauf
wrote
to
singer
in
the
summer
of
1958
at
page
1128.
this
was
after
the
patent
had
been
assigned
after
it
had
issued
and
after
singer
had
brought
the
first
infringement
suit
against
the
japanese.
and
in
this
letter,
gegauf
in
telling
about
some
discussions
he
had
with
the
firm
called
pfaff,
which
had
been
allowed
to
be
licensed
under
the
assignment
agreement
said
about
the
next
to
the
last
paragraph,
halfway
down,
in
these
discussions
with
pfaff,
“i
did
not
mention
of
course
that
you
intend
to
proceed
against
the
japanese
on
the
basis
of
your
patents
and
ours,
what
happened
already
in
the
meantime.
according
to
my
opinion,
the
japanese
can
be
hit
only
if
we
succeed
in
preventing
them
manufacture
of
certain
machines
for
reasons
of
patent
rights.”
i
said
if
we
succeed,
once
again,
this
letter
we
think
clearly
and
it
shows
that
gegauf
was
aware
that
singer
was
planning
to
institute
these
proceedings
against
the
japanese,
that
it
view
itself
participating
in
this
campaign
and
then
it
was
see
--
saw
the
whole
thing
as
a
joint
program,
the
design
to
protect
them
against
the
japanese.
now,
the
assignment
of
the
patent
to
gegauf
to
--
i'm
sorry
by
gegauf
to
singer,
was
not
the
end
of
the
joint
cooperative
endeavors
of
this
parties.
after
the
patent
was
issued
to
singer
in
the
summer
of
1958,
so
i've
indicated
singer
brought
an
infringement
suit
against
the
principal
japanese
manufacturer
which
is
still
pending
and
in
january
of
1959,
it
filed
a
complaint
with
the
tariff
commission
under
section
337
of
the
tariff
act.
that's
the
provision
of
the
tariff
act
which
permits
the
tariff
commission
to
recommend
to
the
president
and
the
president
to
bar
imports
into
this
country
where
the
importation
of
articles
in
commerce
results
in
unfair
competition
or
in
unfair
acts
to
the
detriment
which
will
result
in
destroying
or
substantially
eliminating
an
industry
efficiently
operated
in
the
united
states.
the
purpose
of
this
proceeding,
the
complaint
before
the
tariff
commission,
requested
the
president
to
issue
an
order
barring
from
the
united
states
all
infringing
machines
which
violated
the
so-called
gegauf
patent
which
singer
now
had.
and
while
it's
true
that
it
sought
relief
against
all
infringing
machines
which
under
the
theory
of
the
case
would
have
to
do
before
the
statute,
the
district
court
found
that
in
bringing
this
proceeding,
singer
had
been
motivated
by
the
deluge
of
infringing
japanese
imports
and
that
the
principal
threat
of
japanese
machines
came
from
the
japanese
import
--
i'm
sorry,
principal
threat
to
the
singer
machine
came
from
the
japanese
imports
and
not
from
european
production.
now,
during
the
course
of
this
proceeding,
the
tariff
commission
raised
the
question
with
singer
whether
in
view
of
the
provision
in
the
agreement
for
the
transfer
of
the
patent
which
reserved
to
gegauf
the
right
to
license
this
german
firm
pfaff,
whether
in
fact
pfaff
had
been
licensed
because
the
tariff
commission
takes
the
position
it
will
not
direct
exclusion
of
a
foreign
product
if
in
fact
the
american
manufacturer
is
permitting
licenses
under
the
patent.
singer
told
that
it
hadn't
been,
but
singer
was
afraid
that
this
answer
was
not
convincing
to
the
tariff
commission.
so
singer
wrote
to
gegauf
saying
that
the
only
way
they
could
satisfy
the
tariff
commission,
that
there
had
been
no
license
to
gegauf,
was
to
delete
gegauf's
name
from
the
agreement.
gegauf
wrote
--
i'm
sorry,
to
delete
pfaff's
name
from
the
agreement,
gegauf
wrote
back
that
it
was
agreeable
to
help
singer
as
much
as
possible
in
its
fight
in
the
united
states,
imposed
a
condition
that
wanted
a
certain
guarantee
of
immunity
from
singer,
which
singer
reluctantly
gave
them
and
then
the
agreement
was
signed
deleting
the
reference
to
pfaff.
and
the
last
document
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
to,
is
at
page
1206
of
the
record,
paragraph
number
four
of
that
document.
this
was
an
affidavit
which
gegauf
executed
contemporaneously
with
the
signature
of
the
agreement,
which
deleted
pfaff's
name
from
the
assignment
and
it
shows
we
think
beyond
any
question
that
gegauf
and
pfaff
was
still
--
gegauf
and
singer
were
still
cooperating
in
this
campaign
against
the
japanese.
to
read
--
the
language
reads,
“at
the
request
of
singer
and
for
helping
them
in
their
fight
on
the
united
states
market
against
foreign
competitors,
i
have
today
signed
this
contract.
”
now,
i've
indic
--
already
indicated
our
basic
theory
of
the
case
on
this
issue.
the
sherman
act
requires
that
each
competitor
compete
on
his
own.
the
competitors
cannot
join
hands,
cannot
combine
forces
against
a
common
enemy.
i
think
this
court
put
it
very
well
in
a
somewhat
different
context
in
the
associated
press
case
when
it
stated
that
the
sherman
act
was
specifically
intended
to
prohibit
independent
businessmen
from
becoming
associates
in
a
common
plan
which
is
bound
to
reduce
their
competitor's
opportunity
to
buy
or
sell
the
things
in
which
the
groups
compete.
this
principle
--
this
basic
principle
of
the
sherman
act,
that
a
competitor
must
act
individually,
was
applied
by
the
district
court
in
the
national
lead
case
to
hold
that
competitors
cannot
agree
with
each
other
not
to
license
under
their
patents.
and
we
think
that
in
this
very
case,
the
same
principle
requires
the
conclusion
the
when
you
have
two
competitors
and
have
a
common
enemy,
one
competitor
cannot
transfer
the
patent
by
agreement
with
the
other
where
the
reason
for
the
transfer
is
because
the
other
competitor
is
better
able
to
enforce
it
than
the
first
against
their
common
enemy
and
thereafter
the
two
continue
to
cooperate
in
this
joint
campaign.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
that's
right
mr.
justice,
because
i
think
the
basic
distinction
which
the
sherman
act
draws
is
between
individual
action
by
a
businessman
and
between
concerted
action.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
but
that
--
that
is
right
but
the
con
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon
mr.
justice,
i
think
the
significant
point
is
that
the
concerted
action
in
our
case
relates
to
the
enforcement
of
the
patent
against
the
japanese,
the
combining
to
go
against
the
common
enemy
and
your
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
in
the
sherman
act,
the
purpose
for
which
acts
are
done
is
very
significant,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
right
because
it's
each
and
doing
independently.
but
when
they
have
--
each
one
has
let
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
is
the
touchstone
under
the
sherman
act,
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
think
mr.
justice,
all
that
the
district
court
found
was
at
that
the
time
of
the
sale,
there
was
no
agreement
then
and
there
that
they
would
enforce
it
against
the
japanese
competitors.
i
don't
read
the
district
court
as
finding
that
there
was
no
--
well,
he
did
find,
we
do
challenge
the
finding
and
make
the
finding
at
one
point
that
there
was
no
unity
of
interest
or
common
design.
we
do
challenge
that.
we
think
that
finding
is
contrary
to
the
evidence.
we
think
the
evidence
unequivocally
shows
a
common
design
and
common
character.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
error
of
the
district
court
--
the
error
of
law
that
the
district
court
made
was
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
kind
of
concerted
action
by
two
parties,
amounts
to
a
conspiracy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
the
district
court
held
that
in
order
for
that
to
violate
the
sherman
act,
something
more
would
be
required,
that
is
an
express
under
--
undertaking,
an
express
agreement
by
singer
that
it
would
do
what
the
parties
indicated
they
planned
to.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
it
--
well,
it
seems
to
be
--
it
seems
to
be
the
tone
of
the
district
court's
opinion.
as
we
read
it,
this
seems
to
be
the
finding
because
otherwise,
otherwise
we
don't
see
how
all
of
this
evidence,
all
of
these
joint
dealings
when
put
together
can
be
said
not
to
amount
to
an
illegal
conspiracy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
but
this
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
say
that
--
as
we
read
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
what
the
district
court
said
is,
for
example
let's
take
the
agreement
of
signing
patent,
the
district
court
said
all
you
had
was
an
agreement
from
gegauf
by
which
--
between
gegauf
and
singer,
by
which
gegauf
sold
the
patent
to
singer.
he
said
there
was
no
other
agreement
express
or
implied
other
than
that
set
forth
in
the
transaction.
there
was
no
agreement
by
which
singer
in
effect
agreed
with
gegauf
that
it
would
enforce
the
patent
against
the
japanese.
we
say
that
such
an
agreement
is
not
necessary
in
the
circumstances
shown
here
to
establish
a
violation.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
do
attack
--
we
do
attack,
mr.
justice,
we
do
challenge
defiant
to
the
extent
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
sole
purpose
here
was
a
legitimate
one,
a
lawful
business
purpose,
we
do
attack
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
i
suppose
we
have
to
(inaudible)
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
we
all
--
but
i
think
the
basic
finding
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
i
think
the
base
--
to
whatever
extent,
we
have
to
overturn
the
basic
finding.
the
findings
are
very
narrow
findings.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
there
are
large
numbers
of
finding.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
as
i
say,
i
think
that
on
this
record
there's
no
doubt
that
what
the
purpose
and
the
motive
of
this
transaction
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
would
say
--
i
think
probably
so,
mr.
justice
because
let
me
give
you
as
an
example.
i
suppose
the
--
in
the
sense,
you
might
say
the
effect
of
an
agreement
to
sell
a
patent
from
one
to
the
other
with
the
determination
on
the
part
of
the
acquirer
that
he
is
going
to
enforce
it
against
his
competitors,
this
might
be
said
to
have
an
anticompetitive
effect.
so,
i
would
not
attempt
to
argue
that
merely
because
the
effect
is
likely
to
be
in
our
competitive
facts
or
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
i'd
now
just
like
to
turn
to
the
second
aspect
of
this
case
which
is
the
validity
of
the
provision
in
the
cross-licensing
agreement
by
which
singer
and
gegauf
undertook
to
facilitate
the
allowance
in
any
country
of
claims
as
broad
as
possible
and
as
i
say,
we
think
this
agreement
--
this
provision
was
not
only
set
the
stage
and
has
the
beginning
of
the
conspiracy
but
also
itself
for
the
illegal
restraint
of
trade.
i
just
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i'd
like
to
come
to
that,
mr.
justice.
this
in
effect,
as
i
take
it
is
an
agreement
that
they
will
not
in
any
way
fight
each
other
in
the
interference.
now,
the
nature
of
an
inter
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
pardon?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i'm
not
--
i'm
not
--
i
don't
understand
you.
we
don't
contest
the
validity
of
agreement
not
to
--
well,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
which
i'd
like
to
come
to.
in
the
normal
practice
in
an
interference
proceeding
is
after
an
examiner
has
determined
that
the
claim
which
is
sought
is
patentable,
a
preliminary
investigation.
he
then
searches
the
file
to
see
if
any
other
claims
are
on
issue
for
the
same
invention
and
if
he
concludes
that
two
inventors
have
claims
pending
the
matter
is
put
it
into
interference
and
the
purpose
of
the
interference
proceeding
is
to
determine
who
is
the
first
inventor
and
entitled
to
the
invention.
now,
if
there's
no
issue
as
to
the
validity
of
the
patents
as
to
their
scope,
there's
obviously
no
strong
public
interest
in
determining
which
of
the
two
inventors
gets
it
and
indeed
in
that
kind
of
situation,
it's
in
the
public
interest
we
think
to
settle
these
disputes
before
the
patent
office.
but
under
the
practice
before
the
patent
office,
when
an
interference
is
declared,
the
junior
applicant
for
the
patent
not
only
may
attempt
to
show
that
the
senior
claimant,
the
one
who
has
filed
first
has
in
fact
--
in
fact
is
not
the
inventor,
he
may
attempt
to
attack
the
patent
of
the
senior
claimant.
he
can
contend
that
the
patent
is
too
broad
or
he
can
contend
that
it's
invalid.
now,
the
significance
of
the
latter
is
two-fold.
from
his
point
of
view,
this
means,
if
he
doesn't
think
he
can
prove
he
is
the
inventor,
if
the
patent
is
invalid
he
at
least
can
prevent
the
man
who
has
priority
of
invention
in
keeping
him
from
patenting
the
invention.
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
public
interest,
this
is
far
more
important
because
this
is
one
of
the
few
checks
that
exist
under
our
patent
office
procedure
against
the
issuance
of
unduly
broad
or
invalid
patent.
most
patent
office
procedures
are
ex
parte.
the
patent
offices
that
are
well-known,
the
patent
examiners
unfortunately
are
over
worked.
they
do
the
best
job
they
can,
but
i
think
the
court
knows
that
the
very
large
number
of
patents
that
after
preliminary
inquiry
had
been
issued
by
the
patent
office
have
been
subsequently
invalidated
by
the
courts.
now,
in
this
case,
we
think
that
when
parties
to
a
proceeding
before
the
patent
office,
at
a
time
when
the
interference
hasn't
even
been
declared,
get
together
and
agree
that
they
will
facilitate
and
help
each
other
in
obtaining
the
broadest
possible
claims.
and
i'm
not
saying
parenthetically
there
is
a
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
district
court
held
that
the
only
provision
which
applies
in
the
united
states
is
the
second
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph
which
i
think
my
adversary
is
going
to
stress
and
the
first
one
doesn't
but
we
don't
think
this
makes
any
difference
because
we
think
that
an
agreement
to
facilitate
the
allowance
of
the
broadest
possible
claims
necessarily
also
covers
the
obligation
in
the
first
sentence
of
not
restricting
the
claims
of
the
others.
and
i
will
--
i
will
just
also
mention
in
passing
because
he
may
stress
this
that
they
made
a
claim
that
we
have
waived
any
attack
on
the
first
--
second
sentence
of
the
first
paragraph.
we
deal
with
that
in
our
brief,
but
let
me
come
back
to
the
thing
that
we
think
is
the
basic
vice
in
this
situation.
when
you
have
an
agreement
by
which
two
applicants
before
the
patent
office,
two
people
whose
claims
are
pending
and
where
the
interference
hasn't
even
been
declared
and
they
agree
with
each
other
that
each
will
facilitate
the
allowance
of
the
broadest
possible
claims
to
each
other,
this
necessarily
can
lead
to
the
issuance
of
broad
claims
that
are
illegal
and
i
think
i
can
demonstrate
this
graphic
dramatically
by
the
very
facts
in
this
case.
let
met
tell
the
court
what
happened;
at
the
time
that
this
agreement
was
entered
into,
the
patent
office
had
notified
both
of
the
parties
that
the
claim
of
each
of
them
was
ready
for
interference
and
suggested
a
particular
wording
of
a
claim,
this
is
the
patent
office
practice
for
interference
between
them.
each
of
them
had
accepted
the
claim
and
this
is
obviously
the
claim
they
had
reference
to
when
they
stated
--
recited
in
the
agreement
that
interference
proceedings
were
about
to
open.
after
the
agreement
was
entered
into,
two
weeks
afterwards,
the
patent
office
itself
advised
these
people
that
the
claim
that
the
patent
office
had
proposed
was
too
broad.
it
was
too
broad
because
the
patent
office
had
discovered
an
earlier
patent
which
in
fact
covered
this
invention.
an
earlier
patent,
it
had
not
previously
discovered
that
it
had
been
issued
in
1912
and
what
the
patent
office
did
and
said
in
view
this
earlier
patent,
we
now
suggest
a
much
narrow
--
a
narrower
claim
which
the
parties
then
accepted.
now,
if
the
patent
office
had
not
had
the
good
fortune
to
turn
up
this
1912
patent
in
its
search,
the
inevitable
effect
of
this
agreement
is
that
this
invalid
patent
would
presumably
have
issued.
this
court
stated
in
the
precision
instrument
case
that
applicants
before
the
patent
office
have
an
uncompromising
duty
to
report
to
it
all
facts
concerning
possible
fraud
or
inequitableness
underlying
the
applications
and
issues.
and
we
think
it's
a
violation
of
that
uncompromising
duty
when
two
applicants
for
a
patent
whose
claims
have
not
even
put
in
interference,
agree
at
the
outset
that
they
will
do
everything
to
facilitate
the
allowance
of
the
broadest
possible
claim.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
no.
mr.
justice,
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
suppression
in
this
case,
but
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that's
why
we're
attacking
the
agreement
because
we
think
this
is
the
inevitable
and
the
likely
consequence
of
such.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
and
we
think
all
that
that
means,
mr.
justice
is
that
since
it
referred
to
more
than
one
country
that
in
doing
this,
they
would
observe
the
requirements
of
the
particular
country's
patent
office
involved.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
my
brief
rebuttal
time,
i
just
like
to
refer
to
two
items.
the
first
is
the
question
raised
by
mr.
justice
white
in
his
colloquy
with
mr.
pettit
with
respect
to
precisely
what
singer's
position
was
in
connection
with
the
acquisition
of
the
gegauf
patent
and
the
power
to
enforce
this
patent
against
infringing
machines.
the
machine
which
singer
invented
and
was
developing
its
401
machine
which
had
been
of
the
stand
before
the
recess,
was
a
machine
which
had
a
stack
of
cams
and
two
followers
capable
of
combining
intelligence.
that
was
the
invention
covered
by
the
johnson
patent.
the
gegauf
patent
was
a
more
basic
invention.
it
covered
the
concept
of
a
stack
of
cams
and
a
single
follower.
now
singer,
once
it
got
the
johnson
patent
of
course,
could
have
enforced
that
patent
against
all
machines
which
infringed
the
machine
it
had
invented.
when
singer
says
it
had
to
acquire
the
johnson
--
the
gegauf
patent,
in
order
to
protect
its
invention,
i
think
what
it
really
means
is
it
had
to
acquire
another
patent
because
machines
which
it
could
not
exclude
under
its
patent
was
so
similar
and
it
felt
was
so
competitive
with
its
machine
that
it
was
necessary
for
it
to
get
this
additional
patent,
not
because
it
needed
it
to
protect
infringes
of
its
machine,
but
to
protect
itself
against
the
infringes
who
infringe
the
competing
machine.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
mr.
justice,
at
the
time
it
acquired
the
patent,
it
already
had
the
license.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
true
before
it
got
the
license.
but
once
it
got
the
license,
it
was
free
and
after
it
had
the
license
to
manufacture.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
oh!
yes.
before
they
had
the
license,
it's
clear
they
would
have
--
they
could
not
have
manufactured
their
machine
free
of
the
threat
of
infringement
from
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
mr.
justice,
and
if
i
may
just
conclude
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
this
doesn't.
we
do
not
contend
the
mere
acquisition.
we
do
contend
and
we
think
does
present
to
this
court
the
legal
issue
in
this
case
and
we
think
parenthetically
that
basically
the
district
court
recognized
that
in
this
case
there
was
this
cooperative
endeavor
that
singer
intended
to
enforce
the
patent
and
the
gegauf
so
understood
and
sold
it
to
them
because
of
that
understanding.
we
think
the
legal
question
presented
here
is,
whether
when
one
competitor
assigns
a
patent
to
another,
because
it
believes
and
understands
that
the
other
can
enforce
it
more
effectively
than
it
can
itself
and
then
implements
this
purpose.
in
the
subsequent
course
proceeding,
we
think
this
presents
a
basic
legal
question
whether
such
action
taken
together
to
achieve
a
common
purpose
is
enough
to
establish
a
conspiracy
and
combination
in
violation
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
justice,
this
was
the
first
agreement.
this
was
the
cross-licensing
agreement,
and
we
rely
on
that
insofar
as
it
has
the
provision
under
which
each
agrees
to
facilitate
the
allowance
to
the
other
of
the
broadest
possible
claims,
but
then
we
go
beyond
that
and
we
are
also
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
was
nothing
that
changed
the
effect
of
this.
there
was
an
implementation
we
think
of
this
agreement
by
the
other
two
agreements
to
which
we
refer.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
bowman
is
i
believe
an
official
representative
of
singer's
in
italy.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
he
is
the
representative
of
singer's
in
italy.
mr.
justice
black,
we
rely
not
only
on
the
first
agreement,
but
on
the
second
agreement,
which
is
the
basic
patent
assignment
agreement
and
finally
on
the
third
agreement,
which
i
referred
to
on
thursday
deleting
pfaff
from
the
second
agreement
from
the
assignment
agreement.
thank
you.
