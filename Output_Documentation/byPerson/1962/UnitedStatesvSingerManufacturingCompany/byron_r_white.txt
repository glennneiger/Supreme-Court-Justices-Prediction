mr.
pettit
isn't
it
true
that
the
gegauf
patent
dominated
the
singer
patent
for
multicam
machines?
if
you
have
not
--
if
gegauf
had
wanted
to
that
they
had
stopped
you
from
making
your
multicam
machines?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
first
got
a
license.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
a
renewable
license
or
a
perpetual
license?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
that
license
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
true
then
that
the
acquisition
of
the
patent
was
motivated
by
another
purpose
other
than
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
over
and
beyond
the
gegauf
patent,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
major
part
of
the
johnson's
patent
was
dominated
by
the
gegauf?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
japanese
issue
--
the
japanese
was
not
going
to
complete
with
that
machine,
it
was
different
than
that
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
was
wondering
what
kind
of
power
that
singer
acquired
from
gegauf?
did
it
require
some
--
acquire
the
power
to
exclude
machines
although
competing,
but
they
were
machines
which
singer
was
not
making?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
get
anything
--
it
didn't
get
anything
if
it
wouldn't
have
had
if
gegauf's
patent
never
existed
and
they
would
have
had
the
same
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
with
that
patent
they
could
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
you
are
simply
saying
that
in
order
to
the
government
[inaudible]
here
you
will
have
to
make
it
legal
--
the
near
acquisition
of
a
patent
by
a
competitor
from
another
--
justice
byron
r.
white
there
is
nothing
that
was
done
here
as
anymore
than
what
is
normally
consumed
in
acquisition
of
a
patent.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
they
say
anything
about
excluding
japanese
or
not
if
they've
been
absolutely
silent
necessarily
of
the
--
the
necessary
results
and
it
was
and
would
have
vendor
exclude
competitor.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
between
competitors?
do
you
have
any
case
of
this
court
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
indicating
that
one
competitor
needs
only
[inaudible]
to
his
other
competitors?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
an
acquisition
of
an
asset
of
a
competitor
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
think
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
it
had
an
asset
however
to
put
singer
out
of
business
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
not
much
of
a
competitor
to
have
that
kind
of
a.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
have
this
competitor.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
got
a
patent
on
a
sewing
machine.
