justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
nelson,
in
fact
there
were
(inaudible)
to
negroes?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now
the
state
involved
what
you
cited,
the
government
cited
that
they
be
changed?
could
they
still
(inaudible)
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
has
there
been
--
this
is
irrelevant
to
your
case,
i
have
a
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now
the
fact
(inaudible)
have
there
been
any
statements
by
the
police
or
the
mayor
canceling
out
the
picketing
that
you
referred
to
a
few
minutes
ago?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
did
you
make
the
same
argument
(inaudible)
today,
the
storeowner
evict
the
negroes
and
called
the
police
to
assisting
the
storeowners?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
new
orleans.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
general,
have
made
several
references
to
people
coming
in
and
taking
possession
but
surely
there's
a
difference
here.
these
people
were
invited
into
the
store,
weren't
they?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
thus
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
about
the
statement,
general
--
once
made
by
the
mayor
and
chief
of
police.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
doesn't
this
record
clearly
plainly
indicate
that
was
the
storeowners
didn't
get
together
prior
to
the
particular
demonstration
which
is
here
involved?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
what
about
getting
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
general
what
--
what
if
they
got
together
with
the
police?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
weren't
the
petitioner's
--
weren't
the
defendants
foreclosed
by
the
trial
court
from
offering
that
evidence?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
general,
would
you
have
said
as
a
very
experienced
lawyer
which
you
are
is
very
able
in
that
in
light
of
the
rulings
of
the
trial
court
in
this
case
where
such
evidence
was
offered
any
purpose
would
have
been
served
by
a
counsel
further
pursuing
this
into
trial
court
made
it
very
clear.
i
refer
to
page
94
of
the
record
that
he
would
not
admit
evidence
on
the
question
of
whether
what
was
discussed
with
the
police.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
then
mr.
nelson
object
and
reserve
his
objection
on
that
point?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
look
at
page
94
again
if
you
will.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
doesn't
he
call
that
to
the
court's
attention
when
he
said
that
his
purpose
in
offering
this
evidence
is
to
show
what
state
policy
is?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
are
you
arguing
that
if
the
state
here
directed
the
storeowner
not
to
admit
negroes
it
would
not
be
state
action?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
(inaudible)
of
what
has
happened,
then
what
the
mayor
was
saying
in
his
statement
was,
that
it
was
not
conducive
to
the
best
interest
of
the
city
to
have
these
segregated
eating
places
in
new
orleans.
and
therefore,
he
was
instructing
the
police
department
to
prohibit
any
effort
to
desegregate
restaurants,
isn't
that
what
he
was
saying
in
effect?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
nelson,
your
answer
in
the
hotel
situation.
i
thought
that
the
attorney
general
statement
was
the
correct
one
that
the
state
have
previously
had
statute
banning
segregation
or
the
requiring
segregation
and
he
have
appealed
that
statute,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
i
don't
want
to
belabor
the
point
but
i
--
i
have
though
that
what
happen
said
was
that
there
has
been
a
statute
requiring
segre
--
requiring
this
segregation.
opening
inns
to
everyone
and
their
statute
has
been
repealed.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
now,
the
law
now
stands
there
are
no
statute
at
all.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
innkeeper
statute.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
that
is
correct.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
i
don't
find
such
a
statue
quoted
in
the
government's
brief.
