number
58,
rudolph
lombard
et
al,
petitioner,
versus
louisiana.
mr.
nelson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what
was
mr.
barrett's
answer
to
that?
do
you
have
it
in
your
record
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
the
--
the
mr.
barrett
--
mr.
barrett
asked
the
police
officer,
what
he
was
supposed
to
do.
what
did
the
police
officer
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
your
time
had
this
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
attorney
general
gremillion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
had
you
--
had
your
supreme
court
held
that
your
general
trespass
statute
did
not
apply
to
businesses
like
this?
chief
justice
earl
warren
excuse
me
--
mr.
nelson
wanted
to
conduct
his
cross-examination
and
direct
it
to
this
language
of
the
mayor
in
his
public
statement.
i
have
today
directed
the
superintendent
of
police
that
no
additional
sit-in
demonstrations
or
so-called
peaceful
picketing
outside
retail
stores
by
sit-in
demonstrators
or
their
sympathizers
will
be
permitted.
and
then
jumping
over
to
the
end
of
it,
it
is
my
determination
that
the
community
interest,
the
public
safety,
and
the
economic
welfare
of
this
city
require
that
such
demonstrations
seized
and
that
henceforth,
they
be
prohibited
by
the
police
department.
now,
would
you
discuss
whether
that
represents
state
action
in
as
much
as
the
mayor
is
the
--
is
the
chief
officer
of
the
city
and
the
superintendent
is
his
--
is
appointee
and
subordinate
to
him.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
where
in
the
court
did
he
say
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
--
where
did
they
--
where
did
he
say
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
alright.
well
now,
why
--
why
not
use,
why
not
apply
the
language
that
he
used
in
there
to
--
to
indicate
that?
what
did
he
say
in
there
to
establish
your
position?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
couldn't
--
he
couldn't
go
into
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
could
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
general,
you
said
that
a
few
moments
ago
that
the
mayor
was
speaking
only
of
unlawful
demonstrations.
so,
would
you
show
me
in
his
statement
please
where
he
says
he's
only
referring
to
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
wasn't
speaking
to
general
public
when
he
said
this:
i
have
carefully
reviewed
the
reports
of
these
two
initial
demonstrations
by
a
small
group
of
misguided
white
and
negro
students,
or
former
students.
it
is
my
considered
opinion
that
regardless
of
the
avowed
purpose
or
intent
of
the
participants,
the
effect
of
such
demonstrations
is
not
in
the
public
interest
of
this
community.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he's
talking
about
maintaining
that
policy
of
segregation.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
he
was
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
may
i
just
ask
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
just
one
more
question.
and
he
is
insisting
in
the
statement
that
that
be
adhered
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
general
said
in
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
didn't
say
in
this
case
--
didn't
the
storeowners
say
that
he
was
following
the
local
custom
law
and
something
else?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
he
was
--
he
was
following
the
law?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
and
you
would
found
that
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
you
finally
have
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
go
ahead
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
justice
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
black
was
just
pointing
out
to
you
a
few
moments
ago
that
whether
the
law
in
specific
terms
required
such
a
conduct
that
if
the
administration
of
the
authorities
were
such
that
it
did
that
it
constitutes
state
action.
and
here
they
wouldn't
even
let
the
counsel
for
the
defendants
interrogate
the
owner
as
to
what
his
conversations
were
with
the
police
prior
to
the
time
that
this
all
happened?
suppose
they
have
discussed
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i
don't
quite
understand.
that
i
didn't
quite
understand
in
that
way,
general.
i
thought
that
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
mr.
nelson
wanted
to
inquire
what
the
relationship
between
the
manager
and
the
police
was
before
this
thing
happened
and
the
trial
judge
would
not
permit
him
to
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whatever
it
is,
if
it's
in
the
record
we
have
it,
don't
worry.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
would
have
thought
it
was
immaterial?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
nelson.
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
statute
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
mind
giving
us
--
would
you
mind
giving
us
a
citation
of
that,
mr.
nelson?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
it's
in
the
government's
brief
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
very
well,
never
mind
that
we
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
find
such
a
statute,
will
you
make
a
memorandum
of
it
with
the
court
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well,
mr.
nelson.
