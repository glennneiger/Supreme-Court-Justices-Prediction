mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
may
it
please
the
chief
justice
and
this
honorable
court.
number
58
could
be
the
titled
the
second
chapter
to
the
louisiana
sit-in
story.
since
mr.
garner
in
march
of
1960,
between
that
time
and
the
time
that
mr.
lombard
was
arrested
in
september
of
1960,
the
state
of
louisiana
passed
nine
amendments
to
its
criminal
code
specifically
directed
to
its
curbing
the
sit-in
demonstrations
which
had
so
dramatically
drawn
the
attention
of
the
united
states
and
the
world.
in
fact
in
1960
alone
in
the
state
of
louisiana,
35
acts
and
four
opposed
constitutional
amendments
were
passed
by
the
legislature
affecting
the
segregation
of
races.
so
this
court
as
a
result
to
the
garner
case
is
fully
aware
and
familiar
with
the
history
of
the
segregation
statutes
that
have
been
enacted
in
the
state
and
the
government
brief
spells
them
out
in
details.
the
relevancy
of
this
monumental
number
of
segregation
laws
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
and
also
an
issue
in
this
case
is
the
one
fact
that
in
september
of
1960
there
was
no
statute
requiring
segregation
of
races
at
a
lunch
counter.
in
fact
in
louisiana,
there's
never
been
a
statute
requiring
such
separation
of
races
at
a
lunch
counter
or
in
a
restaurant.
that
also
is
an
issue
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
classical
example
of
how
police
officials
can
implement
state
policy,
state
tradition,
state
custom
in
such
a
way
as
to
deprive
american
citizens
at
a
lunch
counter
of
their
constitutional
rights.
in
this
case
your
honors,
we
are
asking
for
a
reversal
from
a
conviction
of
a
criminal
mischief
statute
and
a
subsequent
sentence
of
60
days
in
jail
and
$350
fine
a
piece.
now
the
facts
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
it
does.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
it
does.
and
it
was
amended
in
june
--
i
have
a
series
of
acts
which
are
referred
the
district
court
to
--
that
trespass
statute
was
amended
to
try
to
curb
the
sit-in
demonstrations
but
in
this
case
we're
charged
under
criminal
mischief
statute
which
has
all
the
ingredients
of
a
trespass
statute.
now
as
you
have
warning
and
if
you
refused
to
move
from
the
part
of
the
store
you're
in,
then
you
commit
a
crime.
this
in
effect
is
a
trespass
type
of
statute.
but
the
facts
in
this
case
are
simple,
three
negroes
and
one
white
at
10:30
in
the
morning
entered
mccrory
store
in
canal
street
proceeded
to
a
segregated
white
lunch
counter,
sat
down
and
were
told
to
move
to
a
negro
counter.
when
they
refused,
the
police
were
called
by
the
manager.
the
police
then
instructed
them
to
move
in
the
presence
of
the
manager
and
when
they
did
not
move
they
were
subsequently
arrested.
there
was
no
question.
it
was
orderly,
dignified
type
of
demonstration.
now,
the
evidence
shows
that
the
manager
is
the
one
that
requested
these
people
to
move.
now
with
these
facts,
it
seems
to
be
that
the
consideration
in
this
particular
case
is
the
clash
of
the
first
amendment
freedom
of
speech
rights
on
one
side
and
the
property
right
of
the
owner
on
the
other
side.
however,
there
were
two
additional
facts
which
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
completely
ignored
and
the
attorney
general
of
louisiana
in
his
brief
for
reasons
of
his
own
completely
ignored
and
that
was
exhibits
number
1
and
2,
and
i
refer
to
your
honors'
attention
to
page
138
and
139
of
this
record
because
these
two
additional
facts
are
extremely
important
in
understanding
an
insight
into
the
mind
of
the
southern
police
law
enforcement
officer
in
the
implementation
of
certain
policy
of
racial
separation
of
races.
it
must
be
understood
that
this
sit-in
took
place
on
september
the
third
--
the
17th,
1960.
on
september
the
9th,
1960,
there
was
another
sit-in
at
woolworth,
a
half
block
away.
the
day
after
the
first
sit-in
the
chief
of
police
issued
a
statement
which
was
highly
publicized
on
radio,
tv,
and
newspaper
and
is
listed
as
exhibit
number
2
on
page
139.
now,
the
chief
of
police
stated
--
referred
to
this
sit-in
at
woolworth
as
a
regrettable
incident
caused
by
few
misguided
youths
and
the
statement
is
directed
specifically
to
storeowners,
constituents
and
negroes.
the
important
part
about
the
chief
of
police
statement
is
on
page
140
in
the
middle
of
the
page
in
which
he
says,
“with
the
exercise
of
continued
responsible
law
abiding
conduct
by
all
person,
we
see
no
reason
for
any
change
whatever
in
the
normal
good
race
relations
that
have
traditionally
existed
in
new
orleans”.
now
keep
in
mind,
there
was
no
statute
requiring
separation
of
races.
on
down
further,
he
says
that,
“the
new
orleans'
police
is
prepared
to
take
prompt
and
effective
action
against
any
person
or
group
who
disturb
the
peace
on
public
or
private
property”.
now
four
days
later,
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
also
issued
a
highly
publicized
statement
on
page
138.
now,
this
statement
is
to
the
point
it's
blocked
and
it
can't
be
misunderstood.
he
said,
he
directed
the
superintendent
of
police
that
not
only
with
no
sit-in
demonstrations
take
place
but
he
prohibited
as
he
put
it,
so-called
“peaceful
picketing”,
in
sympathy
with
sit-in
demonstrators.
he
pointed
out
to
the
people
what
statutes
were
available
for
their
use
and
the
last
paragraph
on
page
139,
it
is
my
determination,
said
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
city
of
new
orleans,
that
the
community
interest,
the
public
safety
and
the
economic
welfare
of
this
city
require
that
such
demonstration
ceased
and
that
henceforth
they
be
prohibited
by
the
police
department.
keep
in
mind
that
there
was
no
statute
requiring
separated
lunch
counters.
now,
the
mayor
and
the
chief
are
both
subpoenaed
and
testified
in
this
case.
they
both
said,
“we
directed
the
people's
attentions
to
sit-in
of
this
particular
type
that
was
involved
in
this
case”.
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
testified
that
there
are
thousands
of
eating
places
in
the
city
and
not
one
to
his
knowledge
catered
to
both
white
and
colored.
now,
these
two
facts
changed
the
inquiry,
i
submit
in
this
case,
from
one
of
a
personal
conflict
of
rights
between
a
patron
and
a
storeowner
to
the
consideration
of
where
does
a
person's
freedom
end
and
where
does
the
state
power
begin.
but
here
in
these
statements
i
submit,
we
find
a
masterful
piece
of
state
deception.
it's
addressed
to
men
unlearned
in
the
law.
it
appeals
to
community
pride
and
the
personal
responsibility.
these
statements
and
mandates
and
directives
are
addressed
to
storeowners,
owners
of
private
property,
who
should
have
the
right
of
--
to
makeup
their
own
mind
regardless
of
the
custom.
but
this
message
as
i
stated
being
clear,
distinct
in
conducting,
misunderstood
in
effect
left
a
storeowner
with
no
choice,
left
him
without
a
choice
of
concurring
in
the
action
of
consenting
to
service
or
allowing
the
negro
to
approach
the
sit-in.
and
so
here,
when
the
supreme
court
of
state
of
louisiana
says
that
this
was
a
free
independent
choice
on
the
part
of
the
storeowner
he
was
referring
to
the
type
of
choice
which
we
usually
have
in
the
state,
a
choice
between
segregation
or
nothing
just
like
the
saint
helena
case.
they
have
a
choice
between
open
segregated
schools
or
no
schools.
the
choice
is
always
conditional.
in
this
case,
the
same
choice
was
offered
to
the
property
owner.
now,
this
message
is
a
more
sophisticated
one
than
the
average
message
gotten
across
in
southern
--
segregated
communities
in
the
south.
it's
not
a
message
to
protect
rights
as
to
prevent
the
exercise
of
rights.
it's
a
rally
and
call
to
hold
the
ranks.
it's
effort
to
keep
public
opinion
from
being
changed.
and
that
was
mentioned
this
morning
by
mr.
moody.
he
was
reared
and
born
in
the
south
and
so
have
i.
never
left
louisiana,
born
in
mississippi,
can
sympathize
with
the
problem
that's
going
on.
but
i
know
this
that
the
demonstrations
that
these
negroes
have
been
going
through
is
the
only
way
that
they
can
get
their
message
across,
the
only
way.
they
know
that
southern
eyes
are
closed
and
will
not
read
placards.
they
know
that
southern
ears
are
deaf
and
will
not
listen
to
pleadings.
but
they
also
know
one
thing
that
a
southerner
can
feel
something
when
you
step
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
and
it's
that
in
which
they
communicate,
that
area.
it's
that
--
that's
the
utterance
that
they're
getting
across.
and
that
is
responsible
for
the
fact
that
because
3,000
of
them
are
now
under
charges.
yet,
many,
many
more
thousands
have
taken
advantage
of
what
these
kids
have
done.
but
i
will
get
to
that
in
a
brief
moment
as
to
why
i
believe
that
the
right
of
this
particular
type
of
demonstration,
unique
and
new
on
the
american
scene
is
indispensable
right
at
this
particular
time
for
the
forward
movement
of
negroes
in
their
quest
for
equal
treatment.
now,
to
get
back
to
the
september
17th
and
the
environment
with
--
within
which
this
decision
took
place,
the
mayor
threw
the
full
weight
of
the
police
force
behind
his
decision.
now
four
days
later,
mr.
barrett,
the
manager
of
mccrory
store,
meekly
told
these
kids
to
move
to
another
counter.
in
fact,
the
police
officer
testified
mr.
barrett
asked
me
what
to
do.
there
was
no
question
that
mr.
barrett
--
he
wanted
them
out.
and
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
in
answer
to
what
sir?
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
well,
the
police
officer
testified
that
mr.
barrett
told
me,
“i
want
these
kids
out
and
what
should
i
do
about
it.”
and
the
police
officer
then
he
--
then
the
police
officer
told
him,
“well,
you
tell
the
kids
to
move
in
our
presence
because
a
misdemeanor
would
have
to
be
committed
in
the
presence
of
the
police
officer.
they
don't
need
a
warrant”.
but
the
point
is
there
was
no
question
but
that
mr.
barrett
wanted
them
out.
mr.
barrett
testified
that
his
counters
are
segregated
and
they
conform
to
state
tradition
policy
and
custom
as
interpreted
by
me,
that's
what
he
said.
now
on
two
occasions
and
i
went
out
to
ask
him,
well,
supposed
the
tradition
would
be
different,
supposed
the
custom
would
be
changed,
would
you
allow
the
negroes
to
sit
there
and
the
court
refused
to
let
him
answer
that
question.
so
as
far
as
we
know,
mr.
barrett
was
conforming
to
state
policy
and
i
might
point
out,
the
state
policy
is
referred
to
in
the
garner
case
is
--
was
passed
by
the
1960's
act
of
legislature
and
act
630
in
reeds,
it
is
the
intention
of
the
citizens
of
a
sovereign
state
that
a
segregation
policy
be
continued.
that
was
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
they
all.
almost
two
years
to
the
date
of
this
arrest,
16
new
orleans
stores
at
one
time
in
connection
with
a
committee
of
businessmen
desegregated
everyone.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
well,
the
state
--
that
most
of
those
laws
or
that
--
they've
been
(inaudible)
in
the
constitution,
wouldn't
have
in
a
lot
of
activity
in
our
federal
district
court
in
new
orleans
and
if
its
--
most
of
them
have
been
declared
unconstitutional.
i
mean,
we
still
have
segregated
hospitals,
prisons,
schools
have
gone
down
the
--
now
integrated
since
the
1960.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
it
is
irrelevant.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
are
two
years
and
one
mail
away.
and
the
lunch
counters
were
desegregated
under
a
new
mayor
who
takes
no
interest
in
what's
going
on.
i
mean,
he
skipped
a
loop
from
this
problem.
this
has
been
done
by
the
efforts
of
a
businessman
in
the
city
and
negroes
independent
of
any
political
participation
at
all.
and
--
so
the
--
there's
been
no
--
the
police
--
we
still
have
the
same
chief
of
police
and
--
but
he
takes
his
orders
from
the
mayor.
the
mayor
testified
that
he
was
a
chief
executive
officer
of
the
police
and
sets
the
policy.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
in
new
orleans?
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
well,
there's
no
question
but
that
it
--
it
was
--
it's
hard
to
envision
right
now
what's
going
on.
we
know
that
technically
it's
desegregated.
i'm
not
trying
the
defense
with
an
answer.
i
just
--
but
i
don't
know
how
i
would
answer
the
question.
if
--
that
the
point
would
be
that
in
new
orleans
in
1960
and
i
might
say
this,
i
heard
this
morning
talk
in
the
first
case,
the
custom
of
the
state
is
different.
but
we
are
dealing
with
a
community,
a
neighborhood,
a
custom
can
be
really
strong
in
a
full
black
area
implemented
by
state
action
and
you
would
have
a
choice
five
blocks
away.
and
the
fact
that
the
free
choice
may
be
in
new
orleans
and
not
in
jefferson
parish
or
let's
say
plaquemines
parish
right
adjacent
to
us
doesn't
make
a
free
choice.
i
would
say
that
in
new
orleans
today,
it
would
--
one
of
the
people
that
agreed
to
take
in
negroes,
if
they
would
renege
on
their
agreement
and
just
back
off,
and
a
negro
would
sit-in
in
that
particular
location,
i
would
say
in
this
date
and
age
in
new
orleans
knowing
that
community
like
i
know
it,
my
argument
would
still
be
the
same.
but
in
any
event
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
well,
no
(inaudible)
--
my
argument
would
not
be
predicated
on
state
action.
my
argument
would
be
based
on
the
fact
that
in
the
segregated
southern
communities
when
you
are
faced
with
as
this
court
referred
a
delicate
and
difficult
--
of
balance
of
the
first
amendment
rights,
the
freedom
of
speech
and
the
property
rights.
i
would
say
that,
in
these
communities,
in
this
day
and
age,
a
negro
who
walks
in
and
stands
at
a
segregated
counter
should
be
free
from
arrest
for
standing
there.
and
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
as
it
is
today
as
i
know
it
and
in
that
regard
--
now
this
is
not
a
question
of
state
action,
this
is
a
question
of
a
man
opening
his
business
to
the
public
who
gives
up
his
right
of
privacy,
who
invites
everybody
in
but
yet,
who
intentionally,
intentionally
keeps
this
so
where
everybody
can
see
it.
and
this
is
--
you
see,
this
is
the
thing
that
has
upset
the
southern
politicians,
this
pilgrimage
of
negroes
to
the
lunch
counter,
the
high
altar
white
supremacy.
it
was
referred
to
this
morning
as
a
symbol
and
it
is
a
symbol.
we
in
the
south
know
what
this
symbol
means.
and
when
a
negro
walks
in
and
sits,
he
is
demonstrating
and
dissenting
to
a
custom
which
as
you
gentlemen
has
said,
not
be
in
decree
in
heaven
will
never
change
and
it
would
never
change,
never
without
court
decision
as
far
as
i
can
see
in
the
deep
south.
but
the
point
is
that
no
one,
no
one
who
has
ever
lived
in
a
real
segregated
community
is
so
naive
as
to
believe
much
less
admit
that
when
a
city
fathers
give
you
these
types
of
instructions
of
conforming
with
state
tradition
that
a
businessman
has
the
will,
the
courage
or
resources
to
disobey.
you
just
don't
back
city
hall
in
a
deep
southern
community
on
this
issue
and
get
away
with
it.
now,
it's
the
retaliation
powers
of
the
--
of
city
hall
and
this
makes
the
license,
of
a
licensing
thing
relevant
because
of
the
conformity
and
the
power
that
the
mayor's
office
has
in
a
--
in
the
--
you're
ice
cream
is
sour.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
if
upon
me,
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
they
ignored
it.
the
supreme
court
found
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
well,
the
district
court
refused
to
let
me
--
to
let
answers
come
in
to
the
questions
of
what
arrangements
did
you
make
with
the
police
before
the
sit-in?
what
(inaudible)
or
a
plan
did
the
police
give
to
you?
this
was
a
military
operation.
when
these
kids
sat-in
the
testimony
was
a
whistle
that
was
blown,
as
soon
as
they
didn't
move
and
with
no
further
instructions,
nothing
was
said,
the
light
went
out,
the
sign
went
up,
the
stools
were
put
away
and
quiet,
no
instructions.
so
with
that
evidence
and
the
fact
that
the
mayor
and
the
chief
had
released
these
statements,
i
felt
that
i
should
have
a
right
to
show
state
action,
what
influence
did
the
police
bring
on
these
storeowners,
and
the
trial
judge
just
excluded
all
of
that.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
no,
the
main
exclusion
of
evidence
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
if
so,
that's
the
question
on
state
action.
yes,
sir.
and
if
--
in
the
other
question
in
this
case,
let's
assume
we
didn't
have
the
two
statements
of
the
mayor
and
the
chief.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
the
evidence
is
in
the
record
--
the
evidence
is
before
you,
the
justices
here.
and
when
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
says
--
found
as
a
fact
that
the
manager,
he's
the
one
that
set
the
policy
independent,
this
was
not
a
fact.
when
--
and
the
--
but
in
any
event,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
ten
additional
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
ask
in
rebuttal.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
i
was
on
mayor
morrison's
staff
for
four
years
as
an
assistant
district
attorney
fully
aware
of
the
problems
involved
in
mayor
morrison's
administration.
i
might
not
point
out
to
court
that
the
reason
why
they
have
a
sign
on
negro
motels
by
colored
only
is
because
of
a
state
statute
that
segregates
inns,
hotels,
and
places
where
people
go
in.
the
attorney
general
must
have
forgotten
above
that
statute
or
overlooked
it.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
no,
it
is
not
sir.
but
it's
still
in
full
force
and
effect
and
it's
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
new
orleans
hotels
have
never
desegregated
specifically
mentioned.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
i
will.
it's
in
the
government's
brief
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
it's
never
been
repealed.
it's
on
the
statute
right
now.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
it
segregates
hotels.
the
negro
and
white
cannot
live
under
the
same
roof
together
in
louisiana
in
a
hotel
in
--
today.
and
that
is
not
a
question
of
state
policy
and
the
reason
why
this
man
would
leave
baton
rouge
as
fast
as
he
would
because
the
police
would
have
ejected
him
not
because
of
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
no
sir,
they
do
not.
another
thing,
please
gentlemen,
if
you
send
this
case
back,
give
us
some
directives,
some
limitations
within
which
we
can
try
this
case.
to
try
cases
like
this
in
louisiana
courts
today
from
a
defendant
attorney
standpoint
is
a
trying
ordeal.
particularly
when
you
get
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
that
makes
statements
above
race
rights
due
to
picketing
and
maybe
that's
what
mayor
morrison
was
referring
to,
you
know
what
the
picketing
consisted
of?
one
picket
walking
on
a
sidewalk
behind
woolworths
on
ardebil
street
was
arrested.
this
is
the
man
that
represents
him.
this
case
is
now
depending
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
this
is
the
case
that
the
attorney
general
said
it
was
about
to
cause
race
riots
and
massive
picketing,
and
people
picketing
push
--
pickets
pushing
people
off
the
sidewalks
in
the
french
quarter,
one
picket.
now,
there
is
a
--
there
is
a
great
deal
of
play
in
louisiana
in
politics.
the
statement
is
when
you
run
for
political
office,
you
play
in
south
louisiana
and
you
pray
in
north
louisiana.
now,
this
same
thing
is
being
done
here.
we
say
one
thing
in
new
orleans
and
thing
here.
and
the
thing
is,
is
that
we
are
trying
to
somehow
to
get
into
the
main
stream
of
a
legal
life
that's
going
on
in
united
states
in
terrebonne
parish
the
unions.
do
you
think
they
want
to
segregate
themselves?
this
is
about
--
a
case
is
just
about
the
store,
it's
five
indians.
you
know,
they
force
an
indian
to
go
to
an
indian
school.
they
can't
go
to
negro
school
or
white
schools
in
terrebonne
parish.
this
is
not
an
indian
reservation.
you
know
they
can't
go
in
high
school
in
terrebonne
parish.
they've
got
a
two
room
grammar
school
there.
and
when
they
want
to
go
to
high
school
they
have
to
tree
hours
to
another
parish.
do
think
they
want
this
as
the
attorney
general
would
have
you
believe?
members
of
this
court,
basically,
this
is
not
a
question
to
eat
a
hotdog
with
a
white
man.
this
is
a
protest
and
dissent
in
an
effort
to
change
attitudes
to
try
to
develop
that
consciousness
of
a
community
to
choose
justice
and
equal
treatment.
basically
that's
what
this
is.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
the
attitudes
in
the
city
new
orleans
have
greatly
changed.
if
by
step
across
the
parish
line
it
has
not
changed
just
one
walk
away
depending
upon
where
i
am.
and
there
is
no
question
that
in
the
--
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
the
attitudes
have
been
changing.
that's
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
on
hotels
and
motels
are
desegregated,
now
am
i
mistaken,
mr.
general?
they
say,
they
have
a
statute
in
full
force
in
effect
to
be
segregated.
you
mean
negro
can
walk
into
the
roosevelt
hotel?
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
well,
you're
talking
about
a
--
the
little
civil
rights
statute
that
we
have.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
if
there
was
until
1954
when
it
was
repealed.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
but
today
hotels
are
segregated
by
statute
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
and
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
well,
in
any
event,
i
will
--
i
will
correct
that
if
i'm
mistaken.
if
i
see
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
i
will.
if
might
--
or
to
new
orleans
city
ordinance
he
says,
--
but
any
event
i
will
correct
that.
if
i
might
just
sum
up
in
a
hurry,
as
i
see
to
this
court
the
job,
the
issue
here
there
are
three:
number
one,
the
determination
of
state
action
in
these
cases,
number
two
the
question
of
defining
the
limits
within
the
which
a
protest
might
be
made
in
a
store
which
is
open
to
the
general
public
and
in
defining
those
limits,
you
also
set
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
state
to
prevent
that
particular
right
being
exercised,
and
the
third
is
brought
by
justice
douglas,
the
question
of
whether
there
is
state
involvement
per
se
in
the
operation
of
a
store
such
as
mccrory's
or
kress
or
woolworths.
now,
in
so
forth
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
no
sir,
they
are
not.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
--
it's
the
same,
they're
identical.
they're
identical.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
that
there's
no
one
who
lives
there
it
would
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
it
would
apply
to
any
store
open
to
the
public.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
now,
i
do
not
say
we
don't
have
to
cons
--
we
do
not
have
to
concern
ourselves
with
the
question
of
whether
the
metropolitan
club
or
the
boston
club
in
the
city
of
new
orleans
because
you
have
an
element
of
privacy
there.
you
have
an
element
of
privacy
that
you
don't
--
you
do
not
have
in
mccrory's
or
woolworths,
or
kress.
and
that
element
may
make
a
tremendous
step
and
so
here
we
concern
ourselves
with
a
piece
of
property
that's
open
to
the
entire
public.
that's
the
--
that's
a
public
store
affair
that
men
have
given
up
their
rights
to
any
type
of
privacy
in
it.
i
--
so
the
question
is
on
that
issue
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
no
sir.
so
on
--
on
that
issue,
the
question
that
we're
looking
for
that
--
if
this
court
--
if
this
case
is
sent
back
specifically
looking
for
guidance
is
whether
or
not
these
kids
who
have
protested
on
this
open
property
or
exercising
a
first
amendment
right,
and
whether
that
right
will
be
preferred
to
the
corresponding
property
right
of
racial
discrimination
that
a
man
may
have,
which
would
of
course
then
be
exercised
by
prosecution
and
subsequent
sentence.
i
say
if
we
start
with
marsh
and
which
was
no
state
action
a
privately
owned
town
in
marsh.
and
as
i
appreciate
the
case
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
no
sir.
but
the
way
i
read
the
marsh
with
the
privately
owned
town
of
marsh
but
no
state
involvement.
this
was
the
day
--
this
was
set
up
as
a
characterization
of
a
particular
piece
of
property
so
as
to
define
the
limits
of
legal
rights
being
exercised
on
it,
apply
that
to
mccrory's.
and
then
we
come
up
to
date
on
the
shelley
versus
kraemer.
and
i
submit
that
on
the
basis
of
these
two
cases,
as
far
as
i
appreciate
the
jurisprudence,
we
can
come
to
an
answer
--
we
can
come
to
the
--
to
the
legal
conclusion
that
the
preferred
right
of
these
kids
to
demonstrate
in
a
manner
in
which
they
did,
and
the
circumstances
which
were
--
within
which
the
act
took
place
and
the
environment
that
covered
the
whole
thing
that
to
be
accused
of
trespassing
was
a
depri
--
was
a
violation
of
their
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
because
of
the
strong
state
action
in
this
case
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
--
i
think
we
can
go
that
far.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
in
mccrory's,
or
stores
open
to
public.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
well
not
--
not
the
morrison's
cafeteria
in
the
city.
they
stopped
at
the
sidewalk.
i
wouldn't
say
that
it
was
open
to
the
public,
not
saenger
theater.
it's
a
property
that's
vested
--
it
has
a
public
faculty
about
it.
but
it's
really
not
open
to
the
public
and
they
might
--
they
put
on
white
only
sign
the
barbershop
that
might
want
just
to
wait
on
white
man.
the
manicurist
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
sir?
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
could
he
say
it?
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
well
your
honor
they
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
i
won't
--
well
we're
not
--
i
haven't.
frankly,
to
answer
your
question
i
have
not
thought
that
through
yet.
because
they
have
an
element
of
privacy
--
of
privacy,
an
element
of
privacy
in
there,
that
we
don't
have
in
the
mccrory
type
situation
where
you
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
sir,
if
the
--
if
that
is
the
predominant
right,
every,
every
dispense
of
a
goods
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
could
refuse
to
serve
every
negro,
at
what
point
then
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
not
indeed,
sir.
and
insofar
as
the
--
as
to
whether
the
constitution
would
prohibit
a
manager
from
actually
serving
the
costumer
i
would
approach
it
on
this
that
i
believe
that
the
constitution
would
prohibit
a
negro
from
protesting
at
that
very
counter
if
it's
open
to
the
public,
that
he'd
not
be
serve.
and
that
for
that
protest
i
don't
think
he
should
be
--
the
constitution
keep
him
out
of
jail.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
absolutely,
under
circumstances
of
which
these
demonstrations
took
place
i
say
this
was
free
speech
and
they
were
invited
in
and
they
can
do
it.
i
respectfully
submit
that
they
can.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
with
the
requesting
of
court
possibility
that
this
case
may
be
sent
back
for
a
new
trial.
and
i
would
respectfully
request
that
that'd
be
done,
that
these
questions
in
this
case
of
these
issues
be
defined
so
that
we'll
have
some
guidance
to
prevent
the
reappearing
in
1964.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
we
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
--
i
don't
think
the
governor
would
dismiss
these
cases.
the
environment
is
not
--
that
i
don't
know.
i
--
i'm
sure
it
would
be
moot,
be
a
question
of
whether
the
district
attorney
would
want
it
just
arbitrarily
nolle
prosequi
the
cases.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
well
i
don't
--
there
is
--
there
is
a
jail
sentence
facing
these
kids
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
well,
if
they
know
mootness
insofar
is
concerned.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
your
honor,
of
course
they
--
louisiana
and
i
respectfully
submit
it
would
not
because
it
depends
--
would
not,
because
the
pendency
of
absolved.
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
you
would.
there's
no
question
--
mr.
john
p.
nelson,
jr.
no
sir.
because
of
the
fact
there's
--
the
pendency
of
so
many
cases
in
alexandria,
in
shreveport
and
in
other
areas
in
louisiana
where
this
is
still
a
vital
issue.
thank
you.
