justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
quite
get
it.
did
i
miss
--
how
did
the
police
--
were
they
called
under
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible)
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
we're
were
we?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
mayor's
statement?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
suppose
you
would
agree,
general,
wouldn't
you
that
even
they
didn't
have
any
law
on
the
book,
if
the
law
wants
to
enforce
customarily
of
the
common
practice
that
that
would
be
the
same
as
though
it
were
written
on
the
books?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
do
with
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
had
them
in
those
cases
of
that
time.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
particularly
in
this
field
and
then
all
them
but
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
had
a
case
where
down
in
tennessee
the
question
of
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
law
has
came
up
on
texas.
the
book
said
one
thing
but
the
practice
was
another.
and
we
said
that
if
the
practice
was
this,
even
though
it
was
not
written
on
the
statute
who
decided
the
case
according
to
the
way
what
actually
happened
as
in
the
yick
wo
case
to
which
justice
douglas
called
your
attention.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
about
what
law
is
written
on
the
book
if
the
states
to
its
official,
i
would
say,
i
would
think
you
would
go
that
far.
justice
hugo
l.
black
because
i
think
your
defense
is
the
one
which
you've
mentioned
at
first
but
have
not
mentioned
in
what
sense
that
you
have
what
is
in
effect
the
trespass
after
warranting
or
trespass
when
a
man
has
been
warned
to
get
out.
i
see
no
difference
between
the
two.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
you
have.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
if
you
have
that
but
even
that
law
is
used
constantly
and
continuously
and
by
agreement
of
officials,
for
the
purpose
of
prohibiting
something
which
you
cannot
--
the
state
cannot
prohibit
to
it
and
i
suppose
you
would
agree
that
the
state
couldn't
pass
the
law
to
make
it
illegal
for
a
merchant
to
serve
a
colored
man,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
that's
right.(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
thought
you
were
that
being
the
case.
if
you
all
--
if
you
have
such
a
law
in
actual
practice
although
it's
not
written
on
the
book.
and
that
law
which
is
an
actual
practice
among
your
officials
were
utilized
here,
how
could
you
escape
the
fact
that
that
was
that
state
action?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
one
could
have
--
one
could
agree
with
your
holding
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
if
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
they
could
have
prove
that
the
mayor
of
the
city
and
he
has
a
good
deal
of
power
whether
--
whether
the
statute
says
that
in
that
he
goes
turn
and
said
now,
we
want
this
stopped,
these
sitting-in.
we're
not
going
to
--
we
don't
care
whether
you
want
it
stopoed
or
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
but
suppose
he
said
that
and
he
said,
if
we're
going
to
have
the
police
read
it,
you
call
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
why
shouldn't
the
man
be
allowed
when
you
said
that
these
are
to
try
to
prove
that
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
we
don't
know
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
can
you
know?
justice
hugo
l.
black
unless
they
have
permitted
to
offer
the
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
i
draw
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
a
distinction
to
myself.
i
like
to
call
your
attention
to
it.
you're
reluctant
to
meet
that
situation.
for
myself,
i
draw
and
decided
a
distinction
between
what
the
state
can
enforce
where
the
owner
of
property
wants
to
protect
it
for
certain
uses,
has
a
right
to
do
it
and
one
where
the
police
or
the
state
steps
in
and
says,
irrespective
of
what
you
want,
i
think
i
wrote
someone
on
that
in
the
struthers
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
irrespective
of
what
you
want,
we
won't
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
we
want
you
--
we
want
to
stop
this
thing
and
therefore
you
sit-in
blacks
and
we'll
arrest
you.if
they
said
that,
you
would
agree
i
suppose
that
that
would
be
state
action.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
asking
you
now,
but
this
only
point
on
that
is,
that
he
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
offer
evidence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
show
it
if
he
could,
maybe
he
couldn't?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
should
a
lawyer
do
that
when
the
court
tells
him
in
advance?
we're
not
going
to
have
any
evidence
on
that
subject.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
conceded.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
this
unlike
many
other
defendants
as
i
read
the
record.
he
didn't
want
to
stand
on
but
it
didn't
set
up
at
time,
he
wants
to
offer
another
evidence
and
show
that
was
not
(inaudible)
and
if
that's
true,
if
it
was
the
choice
of
the
mayor
which
he
follows
rather
than
his
own,
then
of
course
the
principle
on
which
you
stand,
the
owner
has
a
right
to
act
on
his
own
judgment
wouldn't
apply,
would
it?
if
it
was
the
choice
of
the
mayor
rather
than
the
--
and
the
police
rather
than
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
is
one
thing
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
one
thinks
that
the
record
leaves
that
question
unanswered
because
the
court
right
--
have
mistaken
there
are
--
whatever
it
was,
made
or
mistaken
and
not
let
evidence
get
in,
then
of
course
the
case
should
be
reverse,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
understand
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
say
that
that
occurred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
did
you
say
precisely
what
it
could
do?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
apply
to
a
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
that
apply
to
a
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
they
have
one
covering
of
the
store?
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
could
you
distinguish
between
mccrory
and
woolworths?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
for
the
store.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
that's
corner
store
where
the
man
lives
in
it
or
didn't
live
in
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
but
you
would
--
if
it
would
apply
to
mccrory's
and
the
other,
it
would
have
to
apply
for
the
smaller
ones,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
marsh,
as
i
recall
it,
didn't
say
that
a
state
couldn't
have
laws
that
are
against
trespass,
they
have
to
warn
you
of
leaving
the
property
after
notice.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
just
one
thing.
i
don't
--
i
want
to
see
just
the
exact
link
of
the
argument
you've
just
made.
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying
that
the
state
is
without
power
by
reason
of
the
federal
constitution
or
that
owners
of
property
of
the
store
were
unable
because
of
the
federal
constitution
to
decide
who
they'll
sell
and
who
they
want
to
sell
and
the
conditions
under
which
they
will
serve
customers
of
the
store.
do
you
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
understand.
i
understand
that
fully.
but
the
issue,
basic
issue,
when
you
get
to
bottom
of
some
of
these
cases
here
whether
an
owner
of
a
store
can
do
this
and
whether
because
he
has
a
right
to
do
it,
the
state
can
call
its
officials
to
help
enforce
his
legal
rights.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
all
stores
open
to
the
public.
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
they
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
could
the
barbershop
say
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
fourteen
amendment
forbids
the
barbershop
saying
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
it
will
serve
only
white
or
serve
only
colored.
why
does
your
argument
take
it
too
on
the
case
of
that
county?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
find
a
bit
trouble
to
myself.
it's
maybe
because
i'm
too
liberal.
but
i
find
a
great
trouble
myself
seeing
some
store,
some
merchant
dealers
down
there
can
choose
their
customers
and
some
cannot.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
the
man
and
the
country
place
could
by
his
door
is
wide
open
to
everybody
who
wants
to
come
in
and
you
tell
them
not
to.
he
would
be
governed
by
the
constitution
on
that
just
the
same
as
mccrory
or
if
the
constitution
forbids
him
to
choose
his
costumers
on
account
of
color.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
--
are
you
saying
that
the
federal
constitution
without
any
legislation
to
back
it,
bars
a
merchant
from
following
that
course,
that
is,
as
i
understand
it,
it's
ultimately
the
basic
issue
that
would
sometimes
have
to
be
reach
in
some
of
these
cases,
maybe
not
indeed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
question
behind
that
would
still
be
whether
he
can
go
into
a
mercantile
establishment
against
the
will
of
the
owner
or
stay
there
against
the
will
of
the
owner
in
order
to
make
his
speech
of
protest.
are
you
saying
he
could?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
if
we
sent
back
under
louisiana
law
whether
it
would
now
be
moot
since
all
of
the
stores
are
permitting
them
to
come
in?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
they're
--
would
be
moot
then,
they're
moot
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
there
still
would
be
but
how
would
it
change
if
these
cases
were
sent
back
how
in
terms
of
mootness
would
the
situation
had
been
changed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
i
mean
that
somebody
has
to
take
some
actions
before
the
state
would
do
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
there
had
been
a
statute
in
that
state
which
forbad
this
to
be
done,
and
the
state
had
changed
it,
many
states
hold
under
those
circumstances
the
pending
actions
obeyed
cannot
presume
the
same
thing
would
be
through
of
the
judgment.
although
not
a
statute,
it's
a
common
law
it
--
it's
a
custom.
the
law
has
been
forbidden
and
that
law
changes,
their
custom
changes,
the
practice
of
the
state
changes,
the
state
could
well
hope
if
it
wanted
to
and
it
might
that
all
actions
pending
on
it
had
obeyed
it,
but
that
was
the
question.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
we
affirm
this
judgment.
we
have
to
do
it
on
the
basis
on
the
assumption
that
this
person
goes
to
jail.
