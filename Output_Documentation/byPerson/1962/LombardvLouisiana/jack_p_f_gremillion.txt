mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices
of
this
court.
i
find
louisiana
in
a
unique
position
here
today
because
frankly
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
law
as
it
presently
exist
at
least
in
our
opinion
in
this
matter.
i
think
that
this
case
of
lombard
here,
is
one
that
was
largely
determined
revolved
its
decision
on
what
the
facts
actually
are.
and
they
are
so
important
that
i
would
like
to
take
a
minute
to
go
through
the
facts
of
this
case.and
then
we
can
discuss
the
appropriate
legal
points.
now,
the
facts
surrounding
this
case
was
the
basis
of
a
criminal
mischief
charge
brought
against
these
defendants
are
still
in
louisiana.
between
10
and
11
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
september
the
17th
1960,
two
negro
men,
a
negro
woman
and
a
white
man
took
seats
at
a
24
stew
lodge
counter,
reserved
the
white
customers
in
mccrory's
five
and
ten
cent
store
or
canal
street
in
new
orleans.
now,
mccrory's
is
one
of
the
national
chain
operates
in
34
states.
it
sells
all
kind
of
merchandize
and
it's
open
to
the
public
and
of
course
the
statements
i'm
making
here
are
born
out
by
the
record
because
i
am
following
my
brief.
the
question
of
whether
the
lunch
counter
facilities
in
the
various
mccrory
stores
are
segregated
or
integrated
is
left
to
the
national
office
of
the
mccrory
stores
to
be
determined
by
local
tradition
law
and
custom
as
interpreted
by
the
manager
of
each
individual
store.
and
that's
in
a
transcript
of
the
record
at
page
21.
of
course,
as
it
has
been
point
by
mr.
nelson,
louisiana
has
no
law
requiring
segregation
of
eating
facilities
in
its
state.
it
never
has
had
--
neither
thus
the
city
of
new
orleans
nor
do
i
know
of
any
single
municipality
that
has
such
an
ordinance
in
the
state,
back
there
is
none.
now,
the
mccrory
store
in
which
these
defendants
stay
and
having
demonstration
had
separate
food
counters
for
serving
food
to
negro
and
white
customers
since
1938.
and
as
i
said
before,
there
is
no
law
or
ordinance
requiring
the
segregation
with
these
eating
places
and
by
operating
separate
lunch
counters
for
whites
and
negroes,
mccrory
was
simply
following
a
local
custom
as
interpreted
by
that
store
manager,
mr.
barrett.
an
employee
of
the
lunch
counter
at
which
the
defendants
sat
down
called
the
restaurant
manager
who
informed
these
four
students
both
white
and
negro,
that
he
could
not
serve
them
at
that
counter
and
that
he
had
to
sell
them
eating
materials
at
the
rear
of
the
store
were
he
had
a
colored
counter.
now,
when
the
manager
received
no
answer
at
all
from
these
individuals,
this
is
the
restaurant
manager,
he
turned
off
the
lights.
he
removed
the
unoccupied
stools
--
stools
and
he
closed
the
lunch
counter.
a
sign
reading?
this
counter
is
closed
was
pointed
out
to
the
students
but
they
remained
silent.
the
restaurant
manager
then
called
the
store
manager
and
the
police.
now,
the
police
--
it's
significant,
the
police
were
never
present
in
anytime.
the
manger,
mr.
barrett,
came
behind
the
counter
and
he
talked
to
the
individuals
and
he
asked
them
to
leave.
police
still
was
not
in
--
were
not
in
the
establishment.
but
they
neither
answered
in
nor
did
they
move
the
concen
--
continued
to
sit
down.
when
the
police
arrived,
the
store
manager
advised
the
students
in
the
presence
of
the
police
and
prior
to
talking
to
the
police
that
the
counter
which
they
were
seated
was
close
and
he
asked
them
to
leave
the
store,
nothing
happened.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
the
restaurant
manager
notified
the
store
manager
and
then
called
the
police.
up
to
that
time
the
police
were
not
involved
in
this
factual
situation
at
all.
and
when
the
police
arrived,
the
store
manager
talked
to
the
four
individuals
and
he
told
them
that
the
counter
which
they
were
seating
was
closed
and
he
asked
them
to
leave
the
store.
now,
as
i
said
nothing
happened.
thereupon
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
and
the
manager
told
these
individuals
that
he
ordered
them
out
of
store
and
he
asked
the
police
to
take
them
out
of
the
store
because
it
was
his
custom
not
to
serve
them.
his
custom
as
interpreted
by
him.
it
was
his
custom
not
to
serve
them
at
that
particular
counter.
then
the
police
officers
told
them,
?the
manager
wants
you
out.
you
are
violating
louisiana
law.?
and
that's
of
course
is
in
the
record.
and
the
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
he
just
said
you're
violating
the
state
law
and
he
asked
them
to
leave.
he
asked,
which
one
was
the
leader?
and
the
white
student
and
said,
i
am
the
leader.
and
that's
the
only
word
that
was
ever
spoken
by
these
four
people.
he
identified
himself
as
the
leader.
and
he
said
that
they
had
come
there
for
a
particular
purpose.
and
that
their
mission
was
to
be
served
and
that
if
they
were
not
served,
they
were
willing
to
be
arrested.
so
the
major,
i
forget
his
name
right
now,
the
police
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
they
were
violating
the
criminal
mischief
statute
of
the
state
of
louisiana
which
read
as
follows.
and
this
is
the
basis
of
the
charge
against
them,
taking
temporary
possession
of
any
part
or
parts
of
a
place
of
business,
or
remaining
in
place
of
business,
after
the
person
in
charge
of
such
business
or
portion
of
such
business
has
ordered
to
such
person
to
leave
the
premises
after
he
resist
from
the
temporary
possession
of
any
part
of
parts
of
such
business.
in
other
words
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
you
might
say
that
but
it
--
it
was
a
statute
that
was
passed
by
the
1960
session
of
the
legislator,
and
was
designed
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
private
individual
on
his
property
from
the
invasion
by
anyone
regardless
of
race,
creed,
or
color.
now,
counsel
--
and
i
might
go
into
this
right
now.
counsel
has
attempted
to
tell
you
that
there
was
a
great
segregation
program
passed
by
the
state
of
louisiana
of
that
session
of
the
legislature.
well,
it
may
be
that
there
were
a
lot
of
laws
passed
that
was
subsequently
declared
unconstitutional
in
litigation
in
the
eastern
district
and
subsequently
in
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
but
these
particular
statutes,
these
particular
criminal
statutes
were
passed
as
the
result
of
district
attorney's
conferences
and
i
might
tell
the
court
that
as
attorney
general,
i've
already
made
conferences
for
the
district
attorneys
in
my
state
which
is
required
to
some
states.
and
we
meet
every
year
in
february
of
the
year
and
we
discuss
the
decisions
of
this
court
as
they
affect
our
laws.
we
discuss
the
decisions
of
our
supreme
court
as
they
affect
our
criminal
statutes.
and
we
are
always
amending
our
criminal
code
to
provide
the
situations
that
were
never
covered
by
law
of
the
court.
so
there
is
no
significance
to
be
attached
in
such
a
fact
like
that.
in
fact,
as
the
result
of
the
working
with
the
louisiana
law
institute,
our
court
of
criminal
and
civil
procedures
was
completely
overhauled
at
the
same
session
of
the
legislature.
so
i
don't
think
anyone
can
say
that
that
was
the
result
in
trying
to
maintain
the
policy
of
segregation
in
my
states.
some
of
the
laws
that
we
amended
we
act
quite
a
bit
of
litigation
involving
our
registrars
and
voters.
we
woke
up
to
find
out
that
no
one
could
ever
provide
the
material
for
the
registrar
of
voters
because
until
recent
years,
the
office
was
relatively
unimportant.
and
it
passed
the
law
at
that
session
making
the
attorney
general
the
attorney
for
the
registrar
of
voters
just
giving
me
a
little
more
work
to
do.
but
i
recite
that
to
you
because
there's
nothing
in
any
of
these
statutes
that
we
passed
which
would
your
honor
upon
recommendations
of
the
district
attorneys
and
this
act
was
drawn
in
my
office.
so
i
don't
know
why
it
was
put
in
there.
we
never
have
a
statute
before
because
we
never
have
had
situations
that
existed
like
this
before.
we
never
had
the
statute
on
our
books
that
could
punish
someone
for
coming
in
and
taking
possession
of
their
property,
much
like
that
someone
would
walk
into
your
home
and
say,
i'm
in
your
home.
and
you
could
say,
well
i
don't
want
you
in
my
home,
get
out.
and
we
never
had
a
statute
to
cover.
certainly,
you
would
have
the
right
to
invite
him
out
and
if
he
refuse
to
go
out
you
would
certainly
have
the
right
to
call
the
police
because
he
has
no
right
to
be
in
your
home,
no
federal
right,
no
other
vested
right.
and
that's
why
we
pass
this
particular
statute.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
mr.
justice
harlan,
our
general
trespass
statute,
as
i
recall,
relates
mostly
to
farming
and
includes
the
lands.
the
general
trespass
statute
of
our
state
would
not
cover
the
factual
situation
that
it
could
here.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
unfortunately
i
--
i
do
not
have
it
with
me.
i
didn't
think
they
form
a
portion
of
this
case
but
i
would
be
very
glad
to
provide
that
to
the
clerk
for
you.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
but
they
are
the
same
approximately.
they
are
misdemeanors.
they
have
provided
for
a
fine
or
i
believe
one
year
in
jail
up
to
a
thousand
dollars
after
discretion
of
the
court
or
depending
upon
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
it
was
--
no
they
had
never
had
held
but
it
was
always
the
contention
of
the
district
attorneys
and
others
that
the
general
trespass
statute
would
not
apply
to
a
situation
where
individuals
came
in
to
a
place
of
business
such
as
happened
here
and
took
possession
of
it
because
the
general
trespass
statute
did
not
cover
such
a
situation.
and
that's
why
we
pass
this
statute;
we
wanted
to
spell
it
out.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
i
can't
say
--
it's
been
used
in
several
court
prosecutions
in
the
state.
how
many?
i
do
not
know.
but
we
published
a
booklet
on
the
number
of
our
--
we
published
the
booklet
on
the
number
of
ads
that
it's
been
used.
it's
been
used
to
about
40
or
50
times
since
it's
passed
indiscriminately
both
white
and
colored,
i
mean,
regardless
of
race,
creed,
or
color.
there's
been
no
distinction,
your
honors,
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
to
you.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
i'm
sure
that
it
would
apply
to
them
if
one
had
committed
the
particular
crime.
but
our
state
supreme
court
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
your
honor
went
in
to
that
very
catholic
in
his
decision,
when
it
discussed
the
constitutionality
of
its
statute
and
its
application.
and
of
course
i
don't
want
burden
this
court
by
reading
that
to
you
but
it's
in
the
record
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
what's
that?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
you
are
aware?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
alright.
but
i
just
want
to
save
time
because
i
need
to
talk
about
something
that
we
all
know
about.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
that
is
true.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
--
but
after
they
--
after
they
were
invited
in
as
customers
and
they
went
to
this
particular
place
of
business,
the
store
manager
walks
ups
and
says,
i
cannot
serve
you.
i
am
asking
you
to
leave
our
premises.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
i
thought
they
could
make
any
difference
when
he
said,
i
cannot
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
there
is
no
evidence
of
coercion
in
this
case,
your
honor.
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
of
coercion
in
this
record
whatsoever.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i'd
be
very
glad
to
discuss
that.
now,
you
must
bear
in
mind,
that
these
sit-in
demonstrations
occurred
just
about
the
time
we
were
having
sit-in
demonstrations
all
over
the
south.
and
feelings
were
rising
high.
we
had
a
sit-in
demonstration
at
woolworths
which
caused
the
superintendent
of
police
to
issue
that
particular
statement,
but
that
was
on
a
friday.
on
the
next
saturday,
we
had
a
picketing
fiasco
at
another
store
in
the
french
quarter
in
new
orleans.
it
turned
out
not
to
be
in
a
peaceful
picketing
at
all
and
in
fact,
the
police
were
not
there
of
course,
they're
too
being
called.
and
the
picket
were
running
the
pedestrians
over
the
street
and
making
them
run
out
into
the
narrow
streets
of
the
french
quarter.
and
there
was
a
tremendous
excitement
prevailing
that
could
have
blown-up
in
any
minute
and
we
could
have
had
race
riots.
that
was
when
after
that
particular
cause
and
incidentally
those
individuals
have
been
charged
with
obstructing
a
public
passage
way
and
making
pedestrians
get
off.
and
that
case
was
tried
and
they
were
convicted
in
the
lower
court
is
now
in
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana.
and
i
imagine
we'll
be
having
it
up
here
sooner
or
later.
but
anyway
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
a
what,
sir?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
these
laws
were
used
indiscriminately
against
negroes
in
this
particular,
i
do
not.
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
proof
in
this
record
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
it
will
indicate
that.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
we
were
talking
about
the
mayor's
statement
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
so
then
--
so
then
mayor
morrison
issued
his
statement.
now,
i
can
read
those
statements
very
carefully.
i've
read
them
again
this
morning
when
mayor
morrison
refers
to
so-called
peaceful
picketing,
what
he
meant
was
something
that
was
attempting
to
be
conducted
under
the
guise
of
law
which
could
possibly
obstruct
the
peace
and
harmony
of
the
community.
and
that's
why
those
statements
were
issued.
they
were
issued
purely
as
the
ministerial
function
of
the
mayor
and
his
chief
law
enforcement
officer.
it
is
significant
to
note
that
the
mayor
at
no
time
said
he
was
sending
police
to
these
department
stores.
at
no
time
did
he
say
that
he
was
going
to
take
the
law
into
his
own
hands.
and
reading
these,
you
can
only
come
to
the
conclusion
that
here
was
the
mayor
of
a
great
city,
a
great
mayor,
a
distinguished
mayor,
who
was
doing
his
job,
under
the
constitution
of
his
state
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
maintain
peace
and
order.
now,
mr.
justices
let
me
ask
you
this
and
this
is
one
of
the
dilemmas
that
louisiana
face
--
faces.
when
we
in
cases
of
this
kind
call
upon
our
police,
which
we've
certainly
got
a
right
to
do
after
an
occurrence
has
happened
such
as
this.
if
we
fail
to
maintain
the
peace
and
tranquility
of
our
community
by
the
use
of
our
own
police
which
is
paid
to
do
that.
if
we
fail
to
do
that,
we
are
castigated
before
the
eyes
of
the
nation
and
the
press.
the
first
thing,
you
know,
we've
gotten
marshals
and
in
some
cases
troops.
then
if
we
don't
take
care
of
our
people,
if
we
don't
use
our
police
to
maintain
law
and
order
in
a
community,
we
come
before
this
great
tribunal
claiming
that
their
rights
have
been
violated
as
the
result
of
certain
sections
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
constitution.
now,
what
are
we
going
to
do?
the
only
thing
that
we
can
do
is
exactly
what's
transpired
in
this
case.
i
say
to
this
court
that
mayor
morrison
is
a
man
of
moderation
and
so
is
chief
giarrusso.
he'd
been
an
outstanding
mayor
and
he
acted
without
discrimination
whatsoever
in
this
case.
he
had
just
run
for
governor
in
that
law
the
negro
votes.
certainly,
he
wasn't
going
to
turn
around
and
repudiate
him
and
furthermore
i
say
to
this
court
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
would
have
never
appointed
mayor
morrison
as
the
ambassador
to
organization
of
american
states
if
he
had
it
in
anyway
discriminated
against
anybody
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
so
i
attach
no
significance
whatsoever.
it
certainly
not
a
part
of
the
race
just
type
of
this
case.
it
was
not
a
directive
to
any
storeowner
that
they
get
to
together.
it
was
not
a
directive
to
a
storeowner
to
call
the
police,
nothing
was
mentioned
about
that.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
mr.
justice,
my
answer
to
that
is
that
it
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
if
they
have
got
together
and
discuss
it
because
it
doesn't
constitute
state
action.
because
private
citizens
and
owners
private
property
can
get
together
and
discuss
the
problems
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
no
more
than
they
would
get
together
and
discuss
their
income
tax
problem,
the
federal
income
taxes,
would
you
say
that
that
would
be
federal
action?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
they
did
not
get
together
with
the
police.
and
there
is
no
evidence
in
here
to
prove
that
they
have
got
together
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes,
because
of
the
fact
it's
absolutely
irrelevant
to
the
prosecution
of
the
crime.
and
even
if
they
had
proved
it
that
these
people
have
discussed
such
a
situation
before
it,
it's
still
would
be
immaterial
because
all
they
were
talking
about
was
the
question
of
what
their
property
rights
are.
i
repeat
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
but
this
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
if
your
--
mr.
justice
harlan
i
say
to
you
that
even
if
they
had
shown
that
there
have
been
discussions
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
it
would
have
still
been
immaterial
because
--
they
could
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
alright.
if
such
a
thing
was
possible
and
had
been
proved
and
surely
it
would
have
been
allowed
but
he
(voice
overlap)
wait
just
a
minute.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
these
people
were
defended
by
their
competent
counsel.
he
had
chief
giarrusso
on
the
stand.
he
had
morrison
on
the
stand.
he
only
called
them
as
witnesses
on
the
motion
to
quash.
he
didn't
call
them
on
the
trial
of
this
case.
he
had
that
right.
he
had
that
opportunity
to
prove
that
and
did
not
avail
himself
of
it.
so
that
was
even
he
failed
to
do
that
it
didn't
exist.
now,
if
this
court
wants
remand
the
case
for
the
taking
of
that
evidence,
i
shall
move.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
i
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
the
court
went
into
that
very
thoroughly.
they
said
that
it
was
absolutely
immaterial.
he
didn't
offer
to
prove
to
concert
and
apparently
did
they
offer
any
proof
of
concertion
or
solutions,
or
cooperation
to
deny
to
buy
anything.
you
can
look
to
mr.
nelson's
objections
and
he
never
called
that
to
the
court's
attention.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
it's
been
held
in
the
howard
johnson
case
that
regardless
of
what
state
policy
is
that
that
is
not
--
that
come
within
the
scope
of
state
action
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
supreme
court
went
into
that
very
thoroughly
in
its
opinion.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
mr.
justice
goldberg,
i
say
this.
that
if
the
--
oh
yes,
i've
been
reading
here
of
that,
that
there
are
definitely.
i
also
say
this,
that
if
the
manager
and
it
got
together
with
all
the
managers
and
it's
decided
that
they
were
going
to
segregate
their
colors
and
that
--
then
he
comes
around
to
change
his
mind,
and
called
the
police
and
someone
sued
him
rather
as
a
result
of
his
breaking
the
agreement.
that
that
could
of
course
be
state
action,
likewise,
if
you
had
decided
that,
say
he
was
a
great
advocate
of
civil
rights
and
in
his
own
mind
his
interpretation
of
what
the
custom
was
that
he
had
decided,
he
was
going
to
serve
everybody
indiscriminately.
and
that
group
of
each
citizen
called
the
police
and
one
of
them
had
the
police
arrest
him,
do
you
understand?
then
that
would
be
state
action,
but
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
what
happened
here
is
that
you
had
a
bunch
of
people
who
moved
in
deliberately
with
design
sat
down
and
said,
i
want
service.
the
manager
says,
i'm
not
going
to
serve
you.
the
police
had
never
been
called.
the
police
had
never
been
contacted.
the
police
gave
him
ample
opportunity
to
leave
and
reluctantly
arrested
them
after
they
had
been
in
that
count
of
some
20
and
25
minutes.
so
as
--
as
i
--
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
my
answer
to
that
would
be
this,
your
honor.
again,
he
was
speaking
about
his
customers,
but
when
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
that's
what
he's
talking
about
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i'm
looking
at
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
from
the
standpoint
of
what
mayor
morrison
meant
by
that.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
i
come
back
to
this.
he
did
not
call
the
mayor
on
the
trial
of
this
case
and
asked
him
a
single
thing
about
that.
these
sit-ins
happened
after
the
statement
of
the
mayor.
so
apparently
it
had
no
effect.
he
never
discussed
with
mr.
barrett
during
the
trial
of
this
case
whether
barrett
ever
new
about
the
existence
of
those
particular
statements
and
i
don't
think
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
i
don't
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
don't
think
that
--
i
don't
think
that
that
constitutes
state
action,
because
i
think
that
all
that
the
mayor
was
trying
to
do
was
to
maintain
peace
and
order.
and
it
is
a
fact
that
these
sit-ins
occurred
and
mr.
nelson
said
very
quietly
without
any
passion
whatsoever.
and
of
course,
the
state
police
was
not
there
to
stop
them
as
the
result
of
this
statement
by
the
mayor.
the
statement
by
the
mayor
to
me
is
whether
as
the
chief
of
police
is
strictly
one
of
maintaining
peaceful
situations
in
the
city
of
new
orleans.
he
noted
in
his
statement
that
he
didn't
say
anything
about
peaceful
picketing,
he's
talked
about
so-called
peaceful
picketing.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
i
don't
think
that
we
ask
them
all
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
that's
why
--
we
don't
have
such
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
that
into
a
state
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
because
i
think
that
the
cases
show
that
the
merely
utilization
of
the
courts
is
not
sufficient
state
action
as
it
covers
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
the
question
that
we
have
here
to
finally
premise
one
that
you're
talking
about
but
does
this
really
constitutes
state
action?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
now,
what
happened
in
this
particular
instance
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
he
is
talking
about
unlawful
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh,
i
would
agree
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
because
that
didn't
not
--
did
the
factual
situation
as
it
occurred
here.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
only
necessary
--
the
only
you
can
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
only
necessary
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
only
necessary
ingredient
to
this
crime
is
to
show
the
possession
--
is
to
show
the
others
to
leave
and
to
show
the
continuance
of
the
remaining.
and
that
was
all
that
was
necessary
for
this
particular
conviction.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
now
all
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
was
before
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
must
be
quite
frank
with
you
and
tell
you
that
if
that
was
in
the
record,
i
would
agree
with
you.
but
it
is
not
in
the
record
and
it's
not
the
state's
fault
that
he
didn't
call
the
mayor
and
the
superintendent
of
police
to
prove
that
particular
point
even
though
he
was
not
allowed
to
introduce
that
evidence
by
a
question
of
mr.
barrett.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
don't
quite
understand
who
you're
talking
--
you
mean
--
you
mean
the
store
manager?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
mr.
justice
white
all
of
that
--
the
answer
to
that
is
cover
the
in
judge
cox
denial
of
the
motion
to
quash
and
also
in
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
which
is
for
that
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
say
it
is
covered
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
it's
discussed
in
the
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
could
you
just
bear
with
me
just
for
a
second.
here
it
is
on
page
146
of
supreme
court's
opinion.
the
defendants
sought
to
introduce
evidence
to
establish
that
the
action
of
the
manager
of
mccrory's
was
provoked
or
encouraged
by
the
state.
and
that
they
would
have
this
court
hold
at
this
action
of
mccrory's
was
not
of
its
own
voluntary
action,
it
was
influenced
by
the
officers
of
the
state.
the
conclusion
contented
for
as
incompatible
with
the
facts
rather
the
testimony
supports
a
finding
as
a
manager
of
mccrory's
had
for
the
past
several
years
for
few
service
to
negroes,
that
the
policy
the
store
was
established
by
him
that
he'd
setout
the
policy
he
founded
consistently.
that
negroes
had
habitually
been
granted
access
to
one
counter
and
within
the
store
and
it
deliberately
provoked
mischief
and
disturbance
such
as
the
one
he
complained
of
here
had
not
previously
occurred.
in
the
--
passed
to
other
negroes
could
have
mistaken
to
take
sits
encountered
question
and
they
were
told
to
move
and
cooperate,
and
recognize
the
request
of
mccrory's
employees
and
had
said
that
the
counter
set
side
from
him.
even
under
the
provisions
of
requested
statute,
it
is
apparent
that
the
prosecution
is
dependent
from
will
of
the
proprietor.
for
all
that
after
he
is
automatically
intrudes
to
relinquish
possession
of
his
place
of
business
that
a
violation
of
the
statute
occurs.
the
state
therefore
without
the
exercise
of
propriety
would
define
no
basis
under
the
statute
to
prosecute
and
then
it
goes
on
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well
i
--
i
know
that
you
were
not
properly
answer
that
and
i
must
admit
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
mr.
justice
white,
i
will
agree
that
we
are
probably
weak
on
that
particular
point.
but
it
will
just
so
be
it
as
far
as
we're
concerned
if
this
court
says
that
it
should
have
been
allowed
and
the
court
is
not
going
to
do
by
except
of
his
mandate.
but
we
don't
feel
that
their
rights
were
violated
in
this
respect
at
this
particular
trial
because
of
the
provisions
of
louisiana
law.
and
the
court
went
into
that
quite
thoroughly
and
i'll
just
have
to
stand
on
the
decision
of
my
supreme
court.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
he
doesn't
come
right
out
and
say
that.
but
certainly
i
don't
think
anyone
would
understand
that
he
was
trying
to
say
that
he
was
referring
to
anything
but
violations
of
the
law.
in
other
words,
i'm
being
extended
about
this
as
i
possibly
can.
and
i'm
looking
at
--
i'm
considering
what
--
what
occurred,
these
three
demonstrations
and
why
the
mayor
did
this
and
i've
never
talk
to
him
about
it.
i've
never
discussed
it
with
him.
and
i
suppose
that
we
can
draw
that
anyone
can
draw
his
own
inferences
from
his
statement.
but
i
repeat
that
i
think
that
his
statement
was
one
purely
of
a
ministerial
nature
in
which
he
was
trying
to
maintain
the
peace
of
the
community.
because
he
went
ahead
and
quoted
in
his
statement,
mr.
chief
justice,
act
17
of
the
1960
legislature
by
disturbing
the
peace.
he
quoted
another
provisions
of
act
70.
he
quoted
80
which
was
obstructing
public
passages
and
the
restraining
of
traffic.
and
looking
at
it
from
the
overall
picture,
i
don't
think
--
i
think
he
was
directing
his
statement
to
the
entire
population
of
new
orleans
and
not
to
one
specific
group
to
restrain
themselves
and
to
act
in
a
lawful
manner.
now,
that's
what
i
get
from
it
and
apparently
that's
what
the
court
got
from
it
and
i
repeat
that
mayor
morrison
is
certainly
a
man
of
moderation.
he's
very
liberal
with
his
thoughts
and
i
don't
think
that
he
ever
had
in
mind
the
utilization
of
the
police
force
that
he's
an
officer
or
anybody
to
take
anyone's
rights
away.
and
i
repeat
that
certainly
these
sit-ins
occurred
some
four
or
five
days
after
his
particular
statements
so
it
must
have
been
a
situation
whereby
these
individuals
wanted
to
provoke
some
action
where
they
could
come
under
the
cover
in
the
cloak
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
have
their
prosecutions
voided.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
is
correct.
now,
in
all
candor,
he's
not
that
speaking
about
the
policy
of
the
state
which
was
one
in
favor
of
segregation.
that
i
admit,
we
admitted
in
our
brief
that's
what
he
is
talking
about.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
he's
talking
about
a
policy
or
a
custom
which
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
people
in
my
state
had
practice
that
was
since
we
became
a
union,
ever
since
we
were
readmitted
to
the
union
and
which
--
as
our
supreme
court
said
that's
practiced
freely
by
both
white
and
black.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
let
me
tell
you
something,
your
honor
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh
yes.
absolutely,
because
he
--
as
he
says,
it's
not
in
the
public
interest
and
he
does
not
want
any
unlawful
acts
to
occur.
that's
what
i
draw
upon.
we
were
talking
about
inns
and
in
that
connection
let
me
go
into
this.
we
were
talking
about
the
inns
and
hotels
and
you've
talked
to
the
other
states
about
that.
we
have
no
such
statute
in
that
respect.
but,
talking
about
the
policy
of
the
state,
just
recently
a
motel
was
opened
up
in
baton
rouge,
it's
called
the
international
motel.
and
they've
got
signs
all
up
and
down
the
highway.
you
know
what
they
got
on
the
bottom
of
those
signs
in
big
--
owned
and
operated
by
and
for
colored
people
only.
we've
got
the
lincoln
hotel
in
baton
rouge
the
same
way.
we've
got
hotels
in
new
orleans
the
same
way.
we've
got
tourist
courts
in
lafayette.
we've
got
tourist
courts
in
lake
charles
and
shreveport.
and
it's
publicly,
they
said,
this
is
for
colored
only?.
now,
who
made
them
do
that?
strictly,
the
policy
of
state
that's
all.
negroes
are
doing
it
just
as
much
as
white
people,
are
we
to
be
condemned
if
they
do
that,
can
you
say
that
a
policy
is
state
action
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
civil
rights
cases
hold
otherwise
and
i
agree
with
the
gentlemen
up
here
from
baltimore,
wherever
he
was
from,
yesterday
when
he
said
that
to
reverse
these
convictions,
you
have
overrule
civil
rights
cases.
and
i
said
quite
frankly,
i
agree
with
you
as
to
what
the
law
is
now
i
believe
to
overrule
this
if
you
approach
it
from
the
facts
of
the
law
that
you
have
to
overrule
the
civil
rights
acts
which
of
course
will
give
us
by
decision
of
this
court,
if
you
do
that
in
national
civil
rights
policy.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
we
surely
would.
and
if
he
would
go
into
that
international
motel
that
i'm
talking
about
to
seek
a
room,
why
you'd
have
another
astronaut
coming
out
of
baton
rouge.
let
me
tell
you
another
little
incident
now,
mr.
justice.
let
me
tell
you
no
one
--
well
i'm
not
trying
to
be
fastidious
with
the
courts
i
--
i
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
i
really
was
trying
to
tell
you
what
it
would
be.
now,
we
have
a
case
that
i'm
sure
it's
going
to
end
up
here.
i
have
a
negro
in
louisiana
charged
back
with
rape.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
and
he
claims
that
his
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated
because
negroes
have
been
systematically
included
in
the
jury
pounds
and
he
wants
to
be
--
he
wants
to
be
tried
by
an
all
white
jury.
now,
he
had
one
for
the
books.
so
i'm
only
bringing
that
out
to
tell
you
what
the
policy
of
my
state
is
what
the
custom
has
meant.
and
it
hasn't
been
enforced
by
white
people.
it
always
been
enforce
by
negro
thought
as
well.
we've
got
a
little
community
down
at
houma,
louisiana
which
is
sort
of
an
indian
tribe.
a
mixture
of
french
and
negro
and
they've
got
their
own
school,
they
want
their
own
school,
they
tell
the
school
board
they
want
nobody
else
in
there,
they
don't
want
white
people.
they
don't
want
colored
people.
they
don't
want
others.
they
want
their
school.
those
are
things
that
are
just
innate.
those
are
the
things
that
are
positive
and
there's
no
law
that
requires
them.
they
just
do
that.
they
segregate
and
state
onto
themselves.
yes,
gentlemen
this
is
a
serious
question.
i
realize
that
all
of
these
cases
are
ticklish
because
they
involve
prejudices
and
we've
got
prejudices
all
over
the
united
states
not
only
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
in
fact,
i'd
we've
got
more
throughout
the
united
states
and
we
have
in
our
state.
we
don't
--
we
don't
try
to
hurt
anybody.
i
don't
issue
opinions
in
my
office.
this
opinion
is
for
black
and
this
opinion
is
for
white.
i
don't
have
segregated
signs
in
my
office.
i
receive
all
the
races
in
my
office
mexican,
red,
green
and
all,
the
irish.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
he
did
say
that
he
knew
of
no
integrated
eating
places
as
well
as
the
chief.
but
i
come
back
to
the
fact
when
you
read
his
statement
in
view
of
what
had
occurred,
what
was
in
the
papers
about
the
sit-ins
in
the
rest
of
the
cities
and
about
the
two
that
it
already
happened
in
new
orleans.
that
he
was
a
appealing
to
the
prior,
to
the
intellect,
and
to
the
peace
loving
people
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
and
that
that's
all
that
he
was
trying
to
do.
and
now
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
if
he
had
met
otherwise,
he
had
the
power
to
take
police
in
station
him
mccrory's,
in
captain
(inaudible),
in
woolworths,
in
kress,
and
all
of
those
stores,
but
he
did
not
do
that.
he
allowed
those
people
to
conduct
their
business
as
they
wish
and
as
they
saw
fit.
and
that
is
further
proven
by
the
facts
that
this
is
in
the
government's
brief
and
mr.
nelson
admitted
it
yesterday.
that
these
storeowners
have
gotten
together
and
decided
they
were
going
to
open
the
lunch
counters
to
everybody
which
was
done
just
recently.
so
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no.
no,
it
is
not.
there
is
no
one
--
there's
no
evidence
showing
any
connection
whatsoever
between
the
mayor's
statement
and
the
fact
that
the
store
manager
knew
about
it
or
that
he
used
the
mayor's
statement
as
the
basis
of
his
decision.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
the
storeowner
said
he
was
following
local
custom
as
determined
by
him.
and
that
he
had
followed
that
policy
for
years,
and
that
he
had
followed
it
with
other
cities
and
if
that
was
his
prerogative,
and
he
is
alone.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no.
there
is
no
evidence.
and
i
stated
that
earlier,
mr.
justice,
there
is
no
evidence
to
that
effect
that
i
know
of.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh
yes,
because
that
was
his
instruction
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no.
but
we
had
no
law.
you
see
that's
his
statement.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
his
statement
though
tradition
law
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
because
in
other
--
because
in
other
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
mr.
chief
justice
upon
of
it
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
this
is
important.
because
in
other
communities
such
as
a
case
we
have
here,
you
do
have
laws.
and
that's
what
he
was
talking
about.
there
was
no
state
law
written
or
unwritten
on
this
particular
subject.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
he
was
exercising
his
own
right
of
choice.
and
there
is
no
connection?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
--
whatsoever.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
didn't
--
he
said
in
the
record
that
he
hadn't
talk
to
the
police
if
i'm
not
mistaken.
he
said
he
hadn't
talk
to
the
police.
the
police
didn't
tell
him
what
to
do.
that
was
brought
out
here
in
the
trial
of
the
case.
he
ask
--
he
talked
to
the
policeman,
he
says,
what
must
i
do?
and
the
policeman
says,
all
you
can
do
is
to
ask
them
to
leave.
and
he
says,
but
he
had
already
done
that,
do
you
understand?
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
let
me
say
this
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
if
--
if
it
was
--
if
it
was
denied
to
him.
if
i
would've
been
defending
those
people,
i
would
sought
some
other
way
to
get
it
in.
and
i
don't
think
that
louisiana
should
be
held
responsible
for
the
negligence
of
--
because
the
attorney
is
competent
as
my
friend
in
louisiana
maybe.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
no.
not
if
i
have
been
an
assistant
district
attorney
or
if
i
had
been
a
judge,
no,
because
it
was
not
sufficient
to
prove
the
material
or
the
res
gustae,
or
the
essential
allegations
for
a
conviction.
and
in
that,
i
know
judge
clark
very
well.
by
the
way,
you
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
that
was
proven,
your
honor.
that
was
proven.
that
actually
was
proven
that
he
alone
made
that
decision,
that's
in
the
record.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh
yes,
i
see
what
you're
getting
that.
oh
yes.
if
the
mayor
had
sent
instructions
out
by
public
and
so
forth,
and
said,
now
look,
you
don't
let
anybody
come
in
here
that
would
have
been
state
action,
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
but
that
did
not
happen
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well,
i
don't
see
that
it
should
be
reverse.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
sent
back
if
there
is
crucial
evidence.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
would
have
been
state
action.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
well
now,
i
don't
think
so,
mr.
justice
white,
because
the
--
all
of
that
was
thoroughly
going
into
both
on
the
motion
to
quash
and
both
on
the
trial
of
the
cause
that
mr.
nelson
cross
examined
mr.
barrett
and
mr.
(inaudible)
very,
very
thoroughly
and
that
was
brought
out.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that
the
question
of
what
the
national
policy
was
kept
out
of
the
record
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh
yes.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
if
there
had
been
some
showing
that
the
mayor
or
even
the
chief
of
police
said
these
things
--
we're
not
going
to
permit
him,
we're
going
to
put
police
at
the
doors.
you
were
instructed
to
call
us
immediately
and
we
will
arrest
them
for
you,
yes
that
could
be
state
action.
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
oh
yes.
but
we
don't
have
such
a
statute
and
we
never
--
mr.
jack
p.
f.
gremillion
that's
correct.
but
i'm
--
i
will
repeat.
we
have
no
such
statute,
no
ordinance
and
we
never
had.
