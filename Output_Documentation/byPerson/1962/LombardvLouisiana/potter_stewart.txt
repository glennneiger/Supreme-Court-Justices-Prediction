why?
i
don't
see
that?
where
would
the
state
action
come
from
then?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
one
of
them
reneged
and
ordered
the
--
a
negro
to
leave
and
the
negro
didn't
leave.
i
gather
the
owner
had
only
to
call,
is
that
what
you're
telling
us,
the
police
and
he
gets
the
same
police
assistance
he
always
had?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
was
that
done
in
the
presence
of
the
police?
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn't
identify
what
law
they
were
violating,
did
he?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
law
were
they
violating
if
any
right
at
that
moment?
by
saying
they
wanted
to
be
served.
justice
potter
stewart
so
while
--
while
this
is
what
you
referred
or
called
a
criminal
mischief
statute
that
part
of
it
at
least
is
very
similar
to
the
trespass
statute
that
we
have
in
the
previous
cases,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
applied
to
jews?
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
applied
to
people
like
the
americans
with
mexican
ancestor?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
they
say,
i
cannot
or
i
will
not?
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
make
a
great
deal
of
difference.
it's
a
matter
of
semantics
that
are
not
important
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
he
said,
i
cannot
that
meant
that
he
was
being
coerced.
justice
potter
stewart
talking
about
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
(inaudible)
the
restaurants
are
now
intergraded,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
attitudes
that
have
been
change
and
so
far
as
conduct
reflects
attitude?
