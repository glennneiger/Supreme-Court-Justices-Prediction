justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
that
what
(inaudible)
i
take
it
that
that
will
be
in
the
present
situation.
your
point
is
that
city
hall
would
make
it
clear
that
you
still
can't
back
city
hall.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
case
of
the
individual
who
reneged,
the
question
mr.
justice
goldberg
asked.
from
the
present
arrangement
which
i
gather
as
you
told
it
to
us
without
interference
from
government
at
all,
there's
been
no
voluntary
arrangement
to
stores,
negro
groups,
other
citizens
by
which
always
lunch
counters
are
now
desegregated,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no
question
about
that
and
we
who
lived
in
(inaudible)
and
the
custom
knows
that
when
a
negro
--
we
can
all
remember,
was
outside
of
his
own
--
in
the
neighborhood,
it
was
the
police
who
arrested
him.
who
rode
on
a
street
which
was
predominantly
white,
it
was
a
police
who
stopped
him,
as
the
police
has
mentioned
this
morning
out
of
--
that's
preserving
the
system.
but
the
point
here
is
when
the
chief
of
police
instructs
businessmen
to
follow
normal
good
tradition
--
normal
good
relation
and
says,
“this
is
the
custom”.
this
is
the
thing
that
goes
on.
now,
we
have
it
in
writing.
we're
fortunate
enough
to
have
in
this
case.
this
would
be
a
tough
case
if
they
hadn't
(inaudible)
issued
those
newspaper
articles.
it's
not
part
of
the
record
but
i
know
why
they
issued
them
and
that's
irrelevant
here
but
can
you
imagine
to
try
to
cross-examine
the
mayor
or
the
chief
and
ask
him
to
admit
these
things
in
a
southern
community.
what
type
of
pressure
did
you
bring
on
the
businessman
but
we
have
it
in
this
particular
case.
now
i
res
--
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
ignored
this
and
so
does
the
brief
of
the
respondents.
in
an
effort
to
try
to
impress
upon
a
supreme
court
the
tremendous
amount
of
state
action
i
asked
the
--
everybody,
the
manager
what
arrangements
did
you
make
with
the
police,
what
police
arrangements
were
made
with
you
before
and
all
of
these
was
excluded.
the
trial
judge
excluded
it
and
that's
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
that
of
course
we
have
as
much
state
action
in
this
case
i
think
as
any
case
before
this
court
today.
i
have
one
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
answer
to
the
supreme
court's
finding
that
the
owner
would
have
done
this
anyway
and
that
the
state
design
or
the
state
actions
had
no
influence
upon
him.
your
answer
is
that
they
really
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
the
evidence
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
they
wouldn't
let
--
they
approved
not
letting
it
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
--
you
feel
that
this
is
one
of
the
really
significant
issues
in
the
case
or
perhaps
the
most
is
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
who
enforced
what
to
do
to
whom
(inaudible)
to
do
what
is
--
is
really
the
question
i
think,
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
we're
faced
right
to
where
--
we're
faced
then
(inaudible)
supreme
court
of
louisiana's
finding
right
against
you,
aren't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
general
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
some
people
say
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
store
owner
had
decided
his
own,
the
discretion
of
his
own
decision.
and
that
gentleman
is
on
the
stand
that
being
somewhat
significant
to
acquire
to
whether
or
not
this
is
of
the
state's
decision
as
repeatedly
be
excluded.
and
if
when
he
asked
the
question,
he
said
he
--
the
question
was
whether
if
their
decision
was
a
matter
of
conforming
to
state
policy
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
was
the
direction
of
which
apparently
he
was
headed.
now,
it's
true
that
he
might
have
gotten
that
this
in
other
ways.
but
in
the
long
run,
he
would
--
it
would
be
most
sensible,
i
would
think,
to
get
out
through
the
owner
of
the
store
even
if
he
had
the
mayor
and
the
policeman
on
the
stand.
the
police
chief
on
the
stand,
he
still,
i
would
think,
would
feel
some
compulsion
to
get
at
this
matter
to
the
storeowner.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
is
that
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
how
is
it
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
anwer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i'm
--
i
still
don't
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
if
there
is
any
answer
there
specifically
to
the
question
--
justice
byron
r.
white
general
(inaudible)
the
action
of
the
store?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
only
--
the
only
--
is
the
only
fact
that
the
storeowner
that
he
was
following
local
custom?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
evidence
that
he
knew
or
heard
or
being
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
read
the
mayor's
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
general
(inaudible),
i
don't
let
anybody
in
the
store
and
the
department
store
hadn't
anyone
in
the
store
into
the
lunch
counter.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
would
have
been
a
state
action
because
you
still
have
a
question
left
of
the
--
of
whether
or
not
the
storeowner
say,
i
agreed
with
the
mayor
no
matter
what
the
mayor
said
i
would
have
done
anyway.
if
he
had
told
me
to
let
them
in,
i
was
going
to
leave
that
and
i
was
going
to
keep
them
out.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
there
still
--
has
the
question
of
whose
will,
whose
decision
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
then
as
to
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
will
say
then
that
if
there
was
--
if
there
was
an
expressed,
there
was
an
expressed
statement
by
the
mayor,
some
other
official
ruling
or
directive
to
keep
negroes
out
of
lunch
counters
that
that
implements
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
they
keep
it
up
--
when
they
keep
him
out
no
matter
whose
decision
it
was
after
that,
you
would
say
that
--
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
as
long
as
the
--
as
long
as
the
louisiana
had
had
a
state
law
or
a
municipal
ordinance
forbidding
the
storeowners
to
let
negroes
come
to
lunch
counters.
that
would
--
that
would
indicate
as
far
as
you're
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
regardless
of
whether
--
it
would
have
been
constitutionally
unsound.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
with
reference
to
your
argument,
that
you
are
in
fact
saying
that
no
matter
what
how
you
answered
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
storeowner
has
the
right
to
discuss
it
--
that
it's
unquestionably
clear
that
the
state
has
no
right
to
chose
them
for
it,
and
that
in
this
case,
the
state
chose
them
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
one
of
your
--
one
branch
of
your
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you're
correct
on
that
whether
these
other
questions
are
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it's
only
if
you
answer
that
question
in
a
certain
way
that
you
must
reach
the
other
branch
of
your
argument
you'd
stated
today
in
which
i
didn't
understand
you
stated
yesterday,
that
a
store
is
such
an
establishment.
that
it
may
not
discriminate
because
a
store
per
se
is
a
state
action
for
the
purposes
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
