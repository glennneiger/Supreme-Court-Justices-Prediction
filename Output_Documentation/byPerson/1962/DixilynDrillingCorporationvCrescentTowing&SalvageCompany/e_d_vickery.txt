mr.
e.
d.
vickery
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we're
involved
here
with
a
case
that
deals
primarily
with
the
construction
of
an
agreement
or
a
contract
between
an
offshore
billing
contractor
and
the
towage
company
or
the
tug
company
hired
by
the
drilling
contractors
to
move
this
rig
from
pittsburgh-mississippi
to
the
port
of
new
orleans
where
additional
construction
could
be
completed
with
respect
to
it.
on
the
voyage
from
pittsburgh
to
new
orleans,
one
of
the
legs
of
this
offshore
drilling
rig
struck
the
natchez-vidalia
bridge
crossing
the
mississippi
river.
the
trial
court
found
that
this
collision
with
the
bridge
of
the
--
across
the
mississippi
river
resulted
solely
and
completely
from
the
negligence
and
the
fault
of
the
crescent
towing
and
salvage
company
who
had
supplied
the
tugs
for
this
towage
service.
he
predicated
this
finding
of
sole
fault
against
crescent
primarily
on
three
grounds.
first
of
all,
that
crescent
had
negligently
failed
to
supply
sufficient
power
to
control
the
drilling
rig
at
all
times
during
the
movement
down
the
mississippi
river,
which
i
submit
to
this
court
was
the
very
essence
of
its
towing
contract,
supplying
of
sufficient
power
to
control
this
rig
at
all
times.
secondly,
the
court
imposed
liability
on
crescent
solely
in
this
case
because
it
furnished
an
unseaworthy
tug
or
an
unseaworthy
piece
of
equipment
to
participate
in
this
activity.
and
the
unseaworthiness
of
it
was
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
at
the
crucial
moment
approximately
100
feet
upstream
from
the
bridge
that
the
engine
on
this
particular
tug
failed
and
reduce
the
horsepower
that
was
available
to
control
this
rig
by
approximately
600
horsepower.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it
ties
in
--
yes,
i
think
it
is
except
that
in
considering
the
exculpatory
clauses
in
the
contract,
mr.
justice
stewart,
crescent
asked
you
to
relieve
them
not
only
of
their
liability
for
failing
to
furnish
sufficient
power
but
also
of
their
liability
for
unseaworthiness
of
their
equipment.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
court
found
that
the
engine
failed
as
a
matter
of
law
that
makes
the
engine
unseaworthy.
he
did
not
expressly
state
in
his
peti
--
in
his
opinion
that
it
was
unseaworthy,
but
i
don't
believe
anyone
would
dispute
the
fact,
the
mere
fact
that
it
failed
at
the
crucial
time
established
the
unseaworthiness
of
the
engine
on
this
particular
case.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
don't
know
of
how
you
can
--
unless
you
have
a
hole
in
the
hole
when
the
tug
sinks,
your
honor
then
it
might
be
a
little
bit
more
unseaworthy.
this
is
no
danger
to
the
crew
whether
if
it
affects
the
engine.
the
third
crucial
finding
of
negligence
against
crescent
was
the
fact
the
evidence
in
the
record
demonstrated
quite
clearly
that
approximately
a
mile
and
a
half
or
two
miles
upstream
from
this
bridge,
there
was
an
adequate
amount
of
water
in
the
river
where
the
tugs
could
have
lowered
the
legs
to
the
desired
depth
for
55
feet
and
tested
the
ability
of
these
tugs
to
hold
and
control
this
rig
before
they
ever
attempted
to
take
it
down
across
the
rock
way
immediately
above
the
mississippi
river.
these
were
the
three
principle
findings
that
were
made
by
the
district
judge
in
assessing
sole
fault
against
the
crescent
towing
and
salvage
company.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
you
lower
all
three
of
them,
your
honor.
all
three
would
be
lowered
to
a
depth
of
55
feet
in
the
water.
this
would
be
necessary
in
order
to
leave
only
90
feet
of
the
legs
above
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
--
the
water.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
this
is
done
by
three
motors
connected
to
these
three
--
two
leg
--
of
these
three
legs
which
are
constant
speed
motors
that
lower
the
legs
at
approximately
one
foot
per
minute.
the
plan
for
navigation
under
this
bridge
contemplated
the
lowering
of
the
legs
to
35
feet
in
the
water,
well
up
above
the
bridge.
there
is
a
rock
ledge
in
the
river
approximately
1500
feet
upstream
from
the
bridge
which
prevented
the
lowering
of
the
legs
until
you'd
cross
that
rock
ledge
below
this
35
feet
level.
the
plan
was
to
cross
the
rock
ledge,
stop
the
flotilla
until
completely.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
and
then
lower
the
additional
20
feet.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
approximately
20
minutes
since
the
legs
lower
at
one
foot
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
--
per
minute,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
if
the
crescent's
plan
for
navigating
underneath
the
bridge,
they
would
have
had
to
hold
it
steady
there
in
the
water
for
approximately
20
minutes.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
it
was
on
its
way
down
to
new
orleans
where
it
would
be
crescent
and
an
additional
30
feet
would
be
added
to
the
legs.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
where
an
additional
30
feet
would
be
added
to
each
of
the
three
legs.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
=the
crescent
--
crescent
your
honor.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
yes
sir,
i
have
--
the
decision
of
this
court,
they
seem
on
it
your
honor
so
i
guess
it's
appropriate
that
they'd
be
crescent.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes,
it's
much
like
launching
a
ship.
they
have
the
same
ceremonies
for
public
relations
purposes
i
assume.
the
portion
of
the
--
of
the
drilling
rig
which
actually
struck
the
bridge
was
the
right
hand
leg
in
the
extreme
right
hand
corner
of
the
picture.
approximately
one
foot
of
the
upper
portion
of
this
leg
colliding
with
the
bridge
that
it
is
a
pretty
substantial
piece
of
equipment
as
indicated
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
evidence
show
it
picked
the
bridge
up
about
three
feet
and
set
it
right
back
down
and
there
was
no
damage
at
all
to
the
rig.
the
only
damage
done
was
to
the
bridge
itself.
now
then,
the
questions
presented
in
this
case
are
primarily
two.
first
of
all
is
an
exception
to
be
created
to
this
court's
public
policy
rule
first
announced
in
1955
in
the
bisso
and
the
winding
gulf
cases
that
holds
that
a
tug
company
cannot
contract
a
way
liability
for
its
own
negligence
acts.
mr.
justice
black,
in
writing
that
decision
carefully
reviewed
all
of
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
and
concluded
that
as
a
result
of
judicial
history
but
not
only
because
of
judicial
history
but
for
cogent
reasons
in
support
of
the
route
that
contracts
in
which
a
tug
owner
attempted
to
relieve
itself
of
liability
for
its
own
negligence
would
be
struck
down
as
invalid
because
contrary
to
public
policy.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no
sir.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
has
not
been
any
but
i
would
not
want
the
court
to
rely
on
that.
it
may
have
been
and
i
might
not
to
be
aware
of
it.
as
far
as
i
know,
there
have
not
been
any.
the
court
stated
that
there
were
two
rules
for
announcing
this
particular
rule
in
validating
such
contracts
because
contrary
to
public
policy,
the
first
of
which
was
to
discourage
negligence
by
making
wrong
doers
pay
damages
and
the
second
was
to
protect
those
who
were
in
need
of
goods
or
services
from
being
overreached
by
others
who
had
the
power
to
drive
hard
bargains.
and
notwithstanding
this
public
policy
rule
as
announced
in
bisso
and
in
the
winding
gulf
case
in
1955,
the
court
of
appeals
below
has
created
an
exception
to
this
rule
of
bisso
in
the
present
case
and
in
so
doing
relied
on
the
decision
in
southwestern
sugar
and
molasses
company.
that
involved
a
release
from
negligence
clause
contained
in
an
interstate
commerce
commission
tariff.
in
that
particular
opinion,
mr.
justice
harlan
indicated
that
the
court
should
not
declare
invalid
a
release
of
liability
for
negligence
where
a
regulatory
scheme
had
been
set
up
by
the
congress
without
first
having
the
benefit
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
views
on
whether
or
not
this
policy
of
releasing
a
tour
and
a
tariff
from
liability
for
his
negligence
should
be
sustained
or
not.
it
was
an
additional
language
which
mr.
justice
harlan
put
in
that
opinion
which
i
considered
to
be
dictum
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
below
has
seized
in
creating
the
exception
to
the
bisso
rule
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it
came
from
new
orleans,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir,
from
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
this
case
came
from
the
fifth
circuit,
southwestern
sugar
and
molasses
came
from
the
fifth
circuit
also,
your
honor.
the
language
in
the
southwestern
sugar
and
molasses
company
case
indicated
that
they're
going
to
send
this
clause
back
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
its
consideration.
but
then
the
court
said
if
the
peculiar
hazards
involved
in
towing
a
barge
supplied
by
the
shipper
are
great
and
the
methods
of
guarding
against
those
hazards
are
uncertain,
it
maybe
that
in
this
area,
the
court
ought
to
fashion
rules
to
fit
particularized
circumstances.
now
then,
as
i
read
this
additional
language
of
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
in
the
southwestern
sugar
and
molasses
company
case,
he
didn't
say
that
exceptions
ought
to
be,
he
said,
maybe
we
ought
to
have
exceptions
created
to
the
bisso
rule.
but
he
also
attached
two
conditions
precedent
to
any
exception
to
the
bisso
rule
and
these
conditions
were
first
of
all
that
the
peculiar
hazards
involved
in
towing
a
barge
supplied
by
the
shipper
had
to
be
great.
and
secondly,
that
the
methods
of
guarding
against
those
great
and
peculiar
hazards
had
to
be
uncertain.
now,
i
don't
propose
to
tell
this
court
that
this
in
the
peculiar
looking
rig,
you
have
the
picture
there
in
the
respondent's
brief
and
this
is
probably
a
trap
to
--
a
picture
of
which
members
of
this
court
have
probably
had
occasion
to
see
before.
certainly,
it
is
an
unusual
craft,
particularly
so
because
of
the
size
of
the
legs
but
this,
gentlemen,
is
not
any
different
to
my
way
of
thinking
as
a
practical
matter
in
considering
a
peculiar
hazard.
i
don't
think
that
this
drilling
barge
with
these
three
legs
on
it
poses
any
greater
hazard
in
navigating
down
to
mississippi
and
through
these
bridges
than
does
a
tow
consisting
of
some
30
or
40
separate
barges
that
are
latched
together
then
maybe
in
the
control
of
a
single
tug.
i
don't
think
the
hazards
here
are
any
greater
or
any
more
peculiar.
the
danger
of
collision
with
the
supporting
spans
of
a
bridge
is
ever
present
anytime
a
tug
and
barge
passes
underneath.
so
i
think
when
it's
compared
to
the
other
type
of
traffic
that's
seen
on
the
mississippi
river
that
this
doesn't
particularly
represent
any
unusual
hazards
that
maybe
peculiar
because
this
is
a
peculiarly
constructed
vessel
for
the
purpose
of
accomplishing
a
particular
mission.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
at
the
time
this
occurred,
your
honor,
there
had
been
two
others
transported
down
to
mississippi
river
also
by
the
crescent
towing
and
salvage
company.
i
believe
that
this
particular
construction,
this
is
known
as
the
internal
rig,
i
believe
there
are
approximately
five
or
six
in
existence
now.
i
understand
there's
another
one
under
construction
at
this
time
which
will
be
even
larger
than
this
one.
i
would
hate
to
hazard
the
guess
as
to
how
many
offshore
rigs
are
in
existence
that
are
floatable
so
they
can
be
moved
from
one
location
to
another
but
i
suppose
25
or
30
or
maybe
even
more
than
that.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
mr.
kohlmeyer
i'm
sure
can
answer
that
question.
it's
my
understanding,
however,
that
the
fifth
circuit
had
to
pass
on
some
other
questions
on
the
disposition
that
they
made
of
the
other
questions
in
the
case
disposed
of
it
and
it
was
not
necessary
to
go
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
but
mr.
kohlmeyer's
firm
was
in
that
case
and
he
can
give
you
that
information,
that's
my
understanding.
but
i
think
the
key
to
whether
or
not
an
exception
to
the
bisso
rule
should
be
established
in
this
case,
however,
from
the
language
of
southwestern
sugar
and
molasses
is
the
second
condition
precedent
which
mr.
justice
harlan
mentioned.
and
that
is
that
the
methods
of
guarding
against
the
great
and
peculiar
hazards
if
we
assume
that
these
are
great
and
peculiar
hazards,
has
to
be
uncertain.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
there's
nothing
at
all
uncertain
about
the
method
of
preventing
any
damages
such
as
it
has
occurred
in
this
case.
the
method
of
preventing
this
damage
was
for
crescent
to
comply
with
a
very
essence
of
its
contract.
supply
sufficient
seaworthy
tugs
to
control
a
rig
at
all
times.
if
they
had
supplied
a
sufficient
amount
of
horsepower
to
this
rig,
they
would
have
been
able
to
stop
it
completely
in
the
water
as
they
contemplated
but
as
the
district
court
found
this,
they
wholly
failed
to
do.
they
added
an
additional
25%
of
horsepower
to
go
through
baton
rouge
bridge
further
down
the
river
and
they
experienced
no
difficulty.
they
did
experience
difficulty
in
approaching
the
baton
rouge
bridge,
however,
until
they
got
the
extra
horsepower
but
they
didn't
try
to
go
through
baton
rouge
again
until
they
got
sufficient
horsepower.
and
i
think
that
this
is
a
graphic
evidence
and
a
graphic
illustration
of
the
fact
that
crescent
had
exclusively
within
its
power
the
absolute
way
of
preventing
or
guarding
against
any
hazard
of
this
particular
rig
striking
the
bridge.
so
i
submit
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
mr.
kohlmeyer
refers
in
his
brief
to
the
fact
that
additional
horsepower
might
not
have
solved
this
power.
i
frankly
have
not
reviewed
the
record
on
those
facts
to
indicate
that,
but
my
recollection
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
is
that
the
record
will
not
support
that
conclusion
that
sufficient
horsepower
would
in
fact
have
prevented
it.
in
fact,
the
captain
of
the
flotilla
who
the
district
judge
did
not
believe
testified
categorically
that
he
held
her
for
the
20
to
25
minutes
required
to
lower
the
legs.
he
said
that
the
power
that
he
had
was
sufficient
to
control
it
that
he
did
not
need
anymore,
but
the
facts
of
the
case
demonstrated
overwhelmingly
to
the
district
judge
that
in
fact
the
flotilla
was
under
powered.
they
never
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
captain
of
the
flotilla
testified
that
he
stopped
there
for
20
minutes
and
dixilyn's
duty
was
to
lower
the
legs
at
his
command.
he
gave
the
order
that
they
lowered
the
legs
and
that
they
then
told
him
that
all
the
legs
were
at
the
proper
height.
all
of
them
were
55
feet
in
the
water.
so
he
then
started
letting
the
flotilla
drift
downstream
under
control
of
the
tugs
and
then
when
he
was
approximately
200
feet
upstream
from
the
bridge,
he
claims
that
dixilyn's
personnel
discovered
that
they
had
made
a
10-foot
error
in
reading
the
draft
marks
on
one
of
the
legs
and
that
this
could
not
be
discern
because
of
the
distances
involved
and
the
heights
and
so
forth
and
that
he
was
not
aware
of
this
and
that
he
could
not
--
being
that
close
to
the
bridge,
he
could
not
again
stop
the
flotilla
for
the
10
minutes
required
to
prevent
it
from
hitting
the
bridge.
i
might
say
he
is
the
only
one,
he
is
the
only
man
in
the
record
who
testified
to
that
effect
in
the
evidence
from
everybody
else
that
he
did
not
stop
the
tow
for
any
period
of
20
or
25
minutes
is
really
uncontested
except
for
the
testimony
of
captain
bretchel.
his
version
was
that
an
error
of
dixilyn
had
resulted
in
the
legs
striking
the
bridge,
but
this
version
of
the
matter
which
was
bretchel's
all
by
his
self
was
completely
rejected
by
the
district
court.
the
court
found
that
there
wasn't
any
error
in
reading
the
draft
on
the
legs
and
the
court
found
that
dixilyn
was
not
negligent
to
any
extent
that
they
lowered
the
legs
in
a
proper
and
a
reasonably
prudent
manner
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
both
of
the
crafts
were
fully
insured
for
all
the
liability
because
that
might
result
to
the
bridge
in
this
particular
case.
both
--
they're
normal
insurance
policies;
nobody
had
to
take
out
any
extra
insurance.
crescent's
own
normal
insurance
policies
provided
coverage
for
these
damages
so
it
simply
boils
down
to
which
of
the
two
underwriters
pays
the
damages
in
this
case.
it
is
important,
however,
your
honor
because
these
rates
are
based
on
experience
and
so
to
that
extent,
it
would
have
some
--
it
would
have
some
bearing
on
what
the
--
on
who
had
to
pay
the
damages,
their
insurance
rates
would
be
affected
by
it.
it's
not
like
an
automobile
collision
everybody
in
the
state
of
new
york
pays
the
same
rate.
that's
not
the
situation.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it
would
have
to
be
figured
into
his
experience,
yes
sir
to
either
increase
or
decrease
depending
on
his
experience
probably
over
a
five-year
period,
that's
the
way
it's
normally
computed
as
the
experience
of
this
company
over
a
five-year
period
of
time.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
i
think
it's
very
important
that
we
know
specifically
whether
or
not
bisso
is
to
remain
the
law
or
whether
or
not
an
individual
particularized
circumstances
such
as
mr.
justice
harlan
indicated
in
southwestern
sugar,
the
court
sought
to
consider
the
facts
and
the
fashion
special
rules
to
make
special
situations.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
rules
are
different
only
because
of
certain
acts
of
congress
and
regulatory
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
in
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
with
respect
to
insurance
rates?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir,
this
offshore
drilling
rig?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
offshore
drilling
rig?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
it's
in
a
different
category.
they
rated
--
the
offshore
drilling
rigs
are
rated
separately
and
apart
from
tugs
and
barges.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
can't
tell
you.
this
is
something
that
is
a
matter
of
negotiation
between
an
individual
assured
your
honor
and
the
insurance
carrier
that
he
may
select.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
if
this
would
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir,
i
think
definitely
that
it
would.
it
would
then
pass
on,
it
would
increase
the
insurance
rates
insofar
as
offshore
rigs
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
retroactively
insofar
as
any
cases
that
are
still
pending
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
right.
they
have
no
way
to
do
it.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
i
think
that
the
tugs
rates
would
then
go
down
and
the
offshore
drilling
rig
rates
would
go
up
because
the
liability
would
then
be
shipped.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
i
suppose
that
you
can
--
you
can
bring
it
down
to
that
little
nutshell,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir,
it's
very
important.
i
don't
think
that
we
ought
to
--
we
ought
to
deceive
ourselves
into
thinking
as
so
many
laymen
do
that
simply
because
a
casualty
or
damages
are
covered
by
insurance
that
the
assured
is
not
in
fact
paying
those
damages.
the
insurance
companies
get
their
money
from
various
assured.
it's
sure
they
spread
the
risk
over
a
particular
industry
but
when
the
lost
ratio
in
a
given
industry
goes
up
either
because
of
increased
losses
or
because
in
this
case
say
you
changed
the
bisso
rule,
the
industry
has
to
pay
those
insurance
rates.
it's
true
that
they
may
have
some
help
from
other
people
who
are
in
the
industry
and
the
risk
is
spread
over
the
industry.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
none
at
all,
none
at
all.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it's
only
applied
prospectively
to
others,
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
bisso
is
overruled.
the
tug
rates
would
go
down
because
they
would
then
provide
in
their
contracts
that
they
don't
have
any
liability
for
negligence.
it
would
be
shifted
to
the
offshore
rigs
and
the
insurance
rates
on
the
offshore
rigs
would
go
out
because
everybody
has
been
laboring
under
the
impression
that
bisso
is
the
law
and
that
tug
companies
cannot
buy
contracts,
shift
their
liabilities
from
themselves
over
to
the
offshore
rigs
that
they're
towing.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
of
course
that
--
that
brings
up
the
question
of
economic,
the
economic
problems
in
the
case,
mr.
justice
white.
the
owners
of
these
offshore
rigs
in
my
experience
seldom,
if
they
ever
own
their
own
motive
power
with
which
to
move
these
rigs.
i
think
that
there
maybe
some
but
for
the
most
part,
they
hire
tug
companies
who
are
skilled
and
experienced
as
it
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
there
are
a
number
of
tug
companies,
your
honor,
yes,
who
do
this
type
of
towage.
but
now
if
you're
talking
about
competition
in
the
sense
that
you
can
go
out
and
a
rig
can
make
a
contract
for
a
particular
type
of
towage
where
the
tug
company
will
assume
liability
for
its
negligence
and
its
unseaworthiness,
it's
been
my
experience
that
almost
universally,
they
try
to
get
exactly
what
was
attempted
in
this
case.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
think
they
did,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
right.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir,
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
sir?
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
well,
the
court
may
not
feel
so
but
if
you'll
read
the
evidence,
i
will
state
--
you'll
see
the
two
barge
in
the
woods
that
were
negotiating
for
the
drilling
contract
in
this
particular
case
while
they
may
not
have
had
us
by
the
throat
mr.
justice
white,
this
is
the
thing
--
the
thing
i
think
it's
troubling
you,
it's
troubling
the
--
troubled
the
fifth
circuit
also
and
if
that's
the
reason
that
they
reached
the
result
that
they
reached,
your
position
is
why
did
dixilyn
sign
anything?
why
didn't
dixilyn
back
off
and
say
to
crescent
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
no,
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
your
question,
mr.
justice
white.
i
said
i
think
that
it
is
highly
doubtful
that
we
could
have
found
someone
who
would
have
done
it.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
think
that
under
the
previous
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
and
of
this
court
that
we
did
not.
i
know
that
it
sounds
a
little
bit
unusual
under
the
circumstances
and
i've
always
considered
this
rule
that
to
pass
on
liability
for
my
negligence
to
you
that
i
had
to
spell
it
out
in
the
plainest
of
language
to
be
a
little
bit
peculiar.
but
nevertheless,
this
liability
for
negligence
and
unseaworthiness
is
an
unusual
and
an
extraordinary
liability.
and
if
i
want
to
relieve
myself
of
liability
for
my
negligence,
what
is
more
sound
than
to
require
me
to
insist
and
to
ensure
and
to
see
in
the
contract
without
any
power
of
misinterpretation
or
contradiction
that
that
be
spelled
out
in
the
plainest
of
language.
that's
my
position
in
connection
with
this
case,
that
the
language
in
this
contract
is
not
sufficiently
specific.
any
other
panel
i
believe
of
judges
in
the
fifth
circuit
would
have
reached
exactly
the
opposite
result
on
that
point.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
it
ought
to
be
clear
beyond
any
contradiction,
your
honor,
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
correct.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
don't
make
any
apologies
for
the
fact
that
my
client
signed
this
contract
on
the
--
with
the
thought
in
mind
that
this
court
in
bisso
had
said
the
contract
was
illegal.
i
think
my
client
had
a
right
to
rely
on
the
bisso
decision
in
this
case.
it
had
a
right
to
rely
on
the
eight
previous
decisions
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
that
if
you
didn't
put
in
there
specifically
the
word
negligence
or
its
equivalent
that
you
could
not
pass
on
these
unusual
liabilities
to
the
[inaudible]
that
was
being
towed.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
certainly
think
so.
i
don't
see
why
they
should
be
criticized
for
signing
a
contract
that
this
court
had
said
was
absolutely
illegal.
the
--
i'd
like
to
save
the
last
few
minutes
that
i
have
for
rebuttal
if
i
may
--
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
--
your
honor
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
may
i
suppose
on
the
court
for
just
a
minute
or
two
possibly
a
few
comments
that
i
might
make
with
respect
to
this,
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
white's
question
as
to
whether
or
not
any
of
the
other
circuits
had
considered
the
definiteness
of
the
first
circuit,
the
second
circuit,
the
seventh
and
eighth
and
the
ninth
circuits
have
all
followed
the
rule
that
it
has
to
be
stated
in
the
--
inexplicable
language
in
the
contract
itself
not
from
parole
evidence
that
you
may
get
from
the
parties.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
the
fact
that
i
am
passing
my
negligence
on
to
you
after
this.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
fatal,
yes
sir.
and
to
show
you
how
far
the
fifth
circuit
has
gone
in
two
of
these
cases
which
it
refused
to
follow
where
the
language
of
negligence
was
used.
the
court
says,
that
means
simple
negligence
only
and
we
will
not
interpret
it
to
mean
willful
or
wanton
negligence.
they
were
trying
to
stick
the
railroad
with
willful
and
wanton
negligence
and
they
said
you
put
negligence
in
there
that
just
means
simple
negligence.
now,
that's
how
strict
the
fifth
circuit
had
been
with
respect
to
the
interpretation
of
contracts.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
until
this
case.
this
is
a
new
rule
in
the
fifth
circuit.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
yes
sir.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
that's
right.
mr.
e.
d.
vickery
i
don't
think
you
have
to
foresee
the
particular
accident
but
i
think
the
least
that
a
party
in
my
--
in
the
position
of
a
drilling
barge
is
entitled
to
as
they
have
this
spelled
out
in
the
plainest
of
language
in
the
contract.
and
heretofore,
the
courts
have
required
the
party
seeking
the
exemption
to
have
that
spelled
out
in
the
contract.
the
fifth
circuit
now
puts
that
on
the
party
who
is
assuming
a
liability
which
i
think
it's
getting
it
in
the
wrong
place.
now
just
one
other
comment
if
i
may
and
that's
with
mr.
kohlmeyer
may
have
left
the
impression
with
the
court
that
it
had
been
known
that
cres
--
that
dixilyn
was
going
to
take
its
present
position
that
they
will
spend
$40,000
to
buy
a
special
trip
insurance
policy
for
this
particular
towage.
i
think
that
i
have
answered
this
specifically
in
my
reply
when
they
first
solicited
this
business
from
dixilyn.
they
told
us
they
had
all
the
hall
and
p&i
insurance
they
needed.
and
if
this
would
guarantee
full
and
maximum
efficiency
in
the
towage
and
he
has
also
implied
or
possibly
has
created
the
impression
with
the
court
that
under
these
circumstances
they
would
have
gotten
this
special
policy
and
they
gave
dixilyn
a
choice
of
rates.
this
is
absolutely
incorrect
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
will
support
this.
and
let
me
just
read
one
question
and
one
answer
from
crescent's
vice
president
smith.
mr.
kohlmeyer
would
lead
you
to
believe
that
they
gave
crescent
--
dixilyn
a
choice
of
rates
and
said
that
if
you
bear
the
insurance,
it
will
cost
you
so
much.
if
crescent
bares
the
insurance,
it
will
cost
you
so
much.
this
is
a
question
that
was
asked
to
vice
president
smith
of
crescent.
there
was
never
any
quotation
or
any
indication
given
to
dixilyn
of
any
kind
that
it
would
cost
them
so
much
to
move
this
rig
if
they
board
the
[inaudible]
from
the
insurance
and
it
would
cost
them
so
much
more
if
you
bore
it.
answer,
that
question
never
arose.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
which
creates
an
exception
to
bisso
is
clearly
wrong
as
it's
the
refusal
of
that
court
to
follow
the
decisions
of
five
other
circuits
of
this
court
and
of
eight
previous
decisions
of
that
court
interpreting
this
contract
and
i
submit
the
case
should
be
reversed
to
the
fifth
circuit
for
further
consideration
of
the
fact
findings.
thank
you
your
honors.
