mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
vickery
has
very
successfully
in
his
opening
put
before
this
court
many
of
the
facts
of
this
case
which
are
not
included
within
this
record.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
crescent
was
negligent,
whether
or
not
sufficient
horsepower
was
furnished
in
this
flotilla,
whether
or
not
the
engine
on
the
tug
failed
at
the
critical
moment.
these
questions
are
not
here
today.
this
record
has
been
abbreviated.
the
case
is
here
on
the
petition
for
certiorari
addressed
to
the
fifth
circuit
on
two
issues.
the
first,
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
and
second,
assuming
that
the
contract
thus
purport
to
shift
liability
from
the
tower
to
the
barge
whether
or
not
under
such
circumstances,
the
barge,
rather
the
contract
is
valid
or
invalid
under
the
rule
of
bisso.
i
might
say
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
black's
question,
i
think
mr.
justice
harlan
has
pointed
out
the
inequity
of
the
answer
that
mr.
vickery
has
given
in
his
opinion
in
southwestern
sugar
where
he
says
it
might
be
hard
to
say
that
public
policy
demands
that
the
tow
should
at
once
have
the
benefit
of
a
rate
so
computed
and
be
able
to
repudiate
the
correlative
obligation
of
procuring
its
own
insurance
with
the
knowledge
that
the
tow
boat
maybe
required
to
respond
in
damages
for
any
injury
caused
by
its
negligence
despite
the
agreement
to
the
contrary.
now
that
if
the
court
please,
is
what's
happened
here.
these
people
have
gone
into
a
contract
knowing
the
terms
of
the
contract.
with
those
terms
before
them
and
here
we
split
off
widely
from
the
position
of
our
opponents,
with
those
terms
before
them,
they
signed
a
contract
knowing
what
it
says,
but
relying
because
there
were
bears
in
the
woods
if
you
will
on
the
expert
advice
of
their
insurance
underwriters
because
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested
this
is
of
course
a
case
where
there
are
two
sets
of
underwriters
fighting.
incidentally
on
the
question
of
underwriters
and
in
an
answer
to
the
question
about
whether
bisso
would
--
the
reverse
of
bisso
would
cause
a
change
in
rates,
it's
been
my
experience
that
where
there
is
a
subrogation
waiver
or
where
there
is
not
a
subrogation
waiver
in
a
marine
policy,
there
is
no
distinction
whatsoever
in
the
rates.
these
rates
pretty
much
stay
fixed
on
physical
risk
and
physical
risk
does
not
include
the
area
of
recovery
over
against
the
towing
tug
or
the
negligence
of
the
towing
tug.
this
contract,
we
submit,
is
a
contract
which
is
three-pronged.
first,
it
provided
that
the
tug
should
have
the
benefit
of
the
barge's
insurance.
second,
it
provided
that
in
consideration
of
the
performance
of
this
towage
at
a
reduced
rate,
the
barge
would
not
or
rather
the
tug
would
not
be
liable
to
the
barge
for
negligence.
and
third
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
this
is
disputed
if
the
court
please.
it
is,
however,
implicit
in
the
record
--
what
happened
was,
these
people
got
together.
there
was
no
rate
as
such
given.
one
of
these
tugs,
only
one,
was
owned
by
the
respondent.
it
subcontracted
the
chartering
of
the
other
two
tugs
or
the
procuring
of
the
other
two
tugs.
those
rates
are
more
or
less
fixed
and
there
was
no
question
involved
in
it.
these
hourly
rates
and
this
whole
thing
run
on
an
hourly
basis.
it
is
shown,
however,
by
the
record
that
if
there
had
been
a
--
an
--
a
decision
on
the
part
of
dixilyn
not
to
accept
this
release
clause
of
the
shifting
of
liability
that
crescent
would
have
procured
a
trip
policy
on
this
rig
and
thereby
would
have
increase
the
cost
of
the
towage
by
approximately
1%
of
the
value
of
the
rig
which
is
$40,000.
this
rig
costs
$4
million.
1%
on
a
trip
from
pittsburgh
to
new
orleans
would
be
approximately
$40,000.
now
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
without
being
an
underwriter
and
not
knowing
the
answer
to
the
question,
i
would
suggest
that
the
answer
is
negative.
i
would
suggest
that
these
areas
that
you
referred
to
are
not
of
sufficient
moment
in
building
the
rate
to
really
make
a
material
difference
in
the
ultimate
rate
fixed.
the
basic
rate
is
fixed
i
think
on
the
construction
of
this
vessel
whether
it's
steel
or
wood,
the
type
of
engines,
type
of
service
that
it
will
be
used
in
but
i
think
even
mr.
vickery
would
agree
that
these
questions
of
whether
you
can
waive
subrogation
or
waive
recovery
really
form
very
little
in
the
overall
rate
making
theories
of
underwriters.
this
of
course
is
a
personal
opinion,
it's
not
within
the
record
and
i
don't
know
the
answer.
now,
if
the
court
please,
it
is
our
submission
that
bisso
did
not
preclude
a
shifting
of
liabilities
through
the
medium
of
insurance.
bisso
purported
to
say
that
a
straight
release
of
liability
where
there
was
a
dam
barge
in
tow
of
a
tug
could
not
validly
be
granted
because
it
tended
to
cause
negligence
to
become
more
rife
and
the
second
reason
was
to
protect
those
who
needed
protection
in
bargaining
from
being
overreached.
now
neither
of
those
particular
reasons
have
any
place
here
before
the
court
today.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
the
two
reasons
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
if
the
court
please;
it's
our
submission
that
if
--
that
your
honors
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes,
i
think
the
social
one.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes,
it's
wrong
i
think.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
and
the
industry
feels
that
it's
wrong.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
does.
and
it
is
a
fact
that
despite
the
existence
of
the
rule
would
be
so,
many
towers
have
so-called
on
a
contracts
with
customers
so
that
knowing
that
they
may
not
legally
contract
the
way
liability
and
not
being
able
to
formulate
their
insurance
programs
to
cross
name
each
other
as
assurance,
knowing
all
of
that,
they
still
have
on
the
contracts
with
each
other
that
they
won't
sue.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
it
simply
shows
that
the
rule
is
existing
to
block
a
legal
result
that
is
practically
being
achieved
whether
or
not
legal.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no
sir.
this
is
beyond
the
scope
of
the
record.
this
is
an
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
this
was
a
dam
barge
if
the
court
please.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
not
at
all
sir.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no.
we
would
like
to
see
you
overrule
bisso.
we
would
plump
for
its
overruling
because
we
think
it's
bad
law
and
it's
impractical
in
its
result
on
the
inland
business.
we
think
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
overreaching
a
customer.
we
think
that
mr.
justice
douglas'
concurring
opinion
in
bisso
showed
that
he
wanted
an
economic
brief.
we
think
we
have
that
basis
here
in
this
record
before
you
today
to
show
that
there
is
no
economic
coercion
possible
on
the
part
of
a
tug
owner
against
a
barge
owner.
as
mr.
justice
white
suggested,
they
attempt
--
any
attempt
to
coerce
in
this
case
is
clearly
shown
to
have
been
improper
and
impossible
because
they
took
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
this
isn't
that
sort
of
contract.
as
i
say,
i
would
like
to
see
bisso
overruled.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
it
does
not
if
the
court
please.
that's
one
of
the
main
points
where
we
defer.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
this
is
a
contract
which
has
three
phases.
the
first
--
this
is
a
letter
contract;
there's
no
question
about
its
terms,
it's
a
question
about
the
interpretation
of
those
terms.
this
tow,
says
the
contract,
will
be
performed
by
crescent
subject
to
the
towage
release
clause,
a
copy
of
which
is
attached
and
it's
part
of
our
agreement,
it's
been
mutually
understood
and
agreed
that
in
consideration
of
including
this
clause,
lower
rates
will
prevail.
it
is
also
necessary
that
we,
crescent,
be
included
in
dixilyn's
insurance
and
we'll
appreciate
a
letter
from
your
underwriters
advising
us
that
we
have
been
included.
there
was
--
there
was
a
complete
disagreement
on
that
and
the
towage
release
clause,
next
to
that
letter
was
declared
to
be
improper.
they
then
wrote
another
letter
with
further
reference
to
our
undertaking
to
tow
your
drawing
barge
to
new
orleans;
we
confirm
that
the
following
additional
clause
shall
be
included
in
the
contract.
it
is
particularly
understood
and
agreed
that
you're
authorized
to
and
by
this
agreement,
do
release
and
relieve
us
from
any
liability
for
account
of
your
underwriters
and
that
any
damage
claims
urged
by
third
parties
as
well
as
any
claim
which
may
be
urged
by
virtue
of
damage
to
the
drilling
rig
and
the
course
of
the
towage
shall
be
for
your
account
and
for
account
of
your
underwriters.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
it
is
if
the
court
please
but
is
it
illegal?
does
your
honor
say
that
bisso
is
intended
to
foreclose
the
possibility
of
extending
the
barges'
insurance
over
to
the
tug.
this
wasn't
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
as
i
understand
bisso
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
--
because
of
reasons
that
i
consider
inadequate
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well,
i
say
please
overrule
it
first
(voice
overlap)
but
secondarily
if
the
court
the
please,
i
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
don't
see
why
it
is
inherent
in
bisso
that
across
naming
of
assureds
in
an
insurance
policy
is
improper.
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
bisso.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well,
the
result
is
that
the
underwriters
on
the
barge
pay
the
loss
which
is
what
should
happen.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't
do
that
at
all.
what
it
does
is
it
passes
liability
from
one
underwriter
to
another.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
what
you
have
you're
saying.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
but
in
a
way
that
i
say
is
not
reprobated
by
bisso.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
if
the
court
please,
it
is
completely
different
to
say
to
you
that
you
are
in
--
let's
assume
you
have
an
automobile
that
you're
riding
in
or
a
truck
that
you're
driving
and
you
tell
the
truck
insurance
company
that
you
want
the
truck
policy
to
include
all
riders
as
well
as
the
driver
of
the
truck.
i
don't
think
this
is
the
same
thing
at
all
as
saying,
i
assume
your
liability
to
the
writers.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
if
the
court
please,
there
is
no
change
in
rates
for
this.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no
sir,
our
premium
is
fixed.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
oh
surely,
sure.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
if
the
court
please,
you
would
eliminate
that
insurance
if
you're
able
to
foreclose
this.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
if
you're
able
to
foreclose
this
area
of
liability.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
is
correct
if
the
court
please.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
if
there
would
have
been
no
contract,
simply
just
a
towage
service,
the
answer
is
if
we
were
held
to
have
been
responsible
for
this.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
the
court
didn't
reach
that
point
in
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct,
the
district
court
did,
yes
sir.
we
would
have
paid,
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
correct,
which
we
would
have
gotten
at
the
expense
of
the
barge
which
would
have
simply
raised
the
tariff
rate.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that's
one
of
our
arguments
that
differentiates
this
from
bisso
namely
that
they
have
a
choice
of
either
taking
the
contract
with
the
release
clause
where
their
insurance
would
cover
us
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
they
won't
let
us
buy
insurance.
in
the
absence
of
any
coercive
feature,
i
know
nothing
in
bisso
that
would
have
anything
to
say
about
that
particular
problem
and
likewise,
despite
what
mr.
justice
black
says,
i
can
see
no
basis
for
bisso
being
interpreted
as
foreclosing
the
requirement
of
the
insurance
cross
naming.
this
isn't
the
same
thing
at
all
as
the
bisso
case
was.
now,
finally,
there
is
a
grave
difference
between
this
case
and
bisso
in
that
this
case
is
a
--
one
which
involves
the
towage
of
an
enormous
thing
which
is
just
as
improper
to
ask
anyone
to
handle.
this
is
something
that
is
unique
in
--
probably
in
the
area
of
louisiana
and
new
orleans
and
it
involves
such
a
tremendous
amount
of
values
that
it's
economically
unsound
to
require
a
shift
or
rather
not
to
require
a
shift
in
liability
for
those
values.
that
was
recently
brought
out
of
a
shipyard
down
there.
one
of
these
things
is
worth
$8
million.
if
the
tower
goes
to
tow
that
rig
and
loses
the
rig,
he
can't
afford
to
ever
pay
the
money
for
it.
he'll
never
make
up
on
his
experience.
the
rig
people
should
do
this.
the
rig
people
are
willing
to
do
it
and
it's
our
submission
that
your
honor
should
not
say
that
they
cannot
do
it
if
they're
willing
to
and
there
is
no
coercive
power
being
exercised
against
them
in
the
economic
area
to
force
them
to
do
this.
it's
a
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
see
no
inhibition
against
that
in
the
world,
no.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
although
they
agreed
to
give
us,
to
name
us
in
their
policy
for
themselves
and
their
underwriters,
they
failed
to
do
it
and
then
repudiated
that
agreement.
they
kept
the
good
and
repudiated
the
evil
in
this
case.
they
say
we
got
the
cheap
rate
or
in
other
words,
we
did
not
require
you
to
take
out
special
trip
insurance
on
this
rig.
we
took
the
cheaper
of
the
two
rates
and
now
we
say
we
don't
owe
you
because
this
clause
is
improper
and
illegal
whereunder
we
agreed
to
give
you
the
benefit
of
our
insurance.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
may
i
point
out
if
the
court
please
that
moving
these
rigs
is
on
minute
part
of
the
river
business
and
maybe
as
mr.
vickery
suggest
that
50
or
a
hundred
of
these
things
moving
once
every
two
months
or
something
like
that.
this
problem
is
a
problem
inherent
in
the
movement
of
a
million
tons
of
cargo
on
the
inland
waterways
that
comes
everyday
all
day
in
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
situations
daily
instead
of
one
or
two
isolated
situations,
a
week
or
a
month
or
a
year.
this
is
--
this
bisso
case
is
[inaudible]
to
the
industry
and
it
isn't
working
out
as
it
was
supposed
to
work
out.
and
it
doesn't
work
out
in
numerous
instances
where
you
have
even
cross
place
with
one
tower
having
tow
--
tug
and
barge
swapping
tugs
and
barges
with
another
company
having
tugs
and
barges
with
mutual
releases.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
is
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
if
your
honor
--
if
i
said
that,
i
am
completely
wrong.
there
is
a
particular
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
there
is
a
particular
type
of
insurance
which
you
use
for
this
type
of
thing
called
towers
liability
which
means
your
responsibility
to
the
thing
that
you
are
towing
or
to
a
third
party
if
you
bring
the
towed
thing
into
collision
with
the
third
party.
if
there
was
a
release
possible,
the
insurance
which
already
exists
on
the
craft
being
towed,
would
pick
up
that
liability
and
it
necessarily
follows
that
if
that
complete
area
was
stricken
from
the
tugs'
liability
policy,
there
would
be
a
decrease
in
premium
of
course.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
of
course
your
honor
it's
right.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
of
course
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
whether
or
not
the
public
is
being
required
to
pay
twice
for
the
same
thing
because
your
towed
craft
is
carrying
collision
and
p&i
insurance
and
your
towing
craft
is
carrying
towers
liability.
duplicate
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
this
is
the
present
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
this
is
what's
happening
today
and
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
is
correct.
now,
if
the
court
please,
the
uncertainty
in
some
cases
is
so
much
greater
than
the
elusory
uncertainty
in
other
cases.
now
in
this
case,
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
extra
hazardous
tow,
this
extraordinary
value
where
there
is
these
enormous
legs
have
to
be
sunk
beneath
the
surface
and
yet
can't
follow
on
the
bottom
of
the
river
whether
they'll
get
down
quick
enough
to
clear
the
river.
whether
or
not
the
momentum
of
this
enormous
thing
coming
down
could
have
been
stopped
no
matter
how
many
tugs
within
reason
will
put
on
it.
this
question
show
that
this
particular
case
is
one
where
an
exception,
if
the
court
please,
should
be
made
to
this
question
of
the
broad
flat
statement
that
there
can
be
no
liability
or
rather
no
releases
from
liability.
because
here
is
the
ideal
place
to
apply
the
rule
that
mr.
justice
harlan
suggested
in
southwestern
sugar
that
there
is
extra
hazardous
towage
involved,
that
there
is
a
reason
for
a
change
in
the
flat
statement
of
the
bisso
case.
and
that
here,
if
nowhere
else,
there
--
a
sufficient
hazards
to
justify
an
exception
to
that
rule.
now,
before
closing,
if
the
court
please,
there
are
--
there
is
really
one
other
question
inherent
in
the
record
and
that's
the
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
contract.
on
the
assumption
that
your
honors
were
not
so
much
interested
in
that
area
because
in
that
area,
the
fifth
circuit
has
held
in
this
case
that
there
is
no
inconclusive
reasoning
behind
this
contract
that
it's
perfectly
clear
to
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
contract
can
mean
only
one
thing
and
that
the
conclusion
as
judge
reeves
stated
is
inescapable
that
dixilyn
when
agreed
to
afford
crescent
the
benefit
of
dixilyn's
insurance,
it's
our
submission
that
under
these
circumstances
since
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
is
a
question
of
fact
that
the
factual
issue
is
not
to
be
discussed
before
the
court
and
that
certiorari
here
was
granted
on
the
sole
question
of
whether
or
not
bisso
was
determinative
of
this
particular
situation.
the
briefs
have
been
filed
however
which
cover
the
position
of
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
and
although
we
submit
it's
quite
clear,
we
think
that
the
real
question
before
your
honors
today
is
whether
this
case,
assuming
you
don't
want
to
reverse
bisso
although
we
think
it
should
be
reversed
and
i
think
the
industry
feels
that
it
should
be
reversed
at
least
inside
in
the
inland
waterways,
the
real
question
is
whether
or
not
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
so
if
the
court
please.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
the
answer
--
the
answer
to
that
is
i
guess
that
the
authority
to
get
a
law
through
congress'
is
one
of
those
things
that
we
can
never
figure
how
to
do.
it
takes
a
long
and
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
strange
as
it
might
say.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
but
if
the
court
please,
why
should
the
court
rule
as
a
matter
of
judge
made
law
that
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
well
it's
the
question
of
interpretation
of
the
circle
as
i
think
but
assuming
that
the
court
--
obviously,
there's
no
statutory
construction
involved.
it's
a
court
made
law
that
a
tug
may
not
get
a
release
from
a
tow,
but
why
then
can
a
carrier
get
a
release
from
cargo.
you're
putting
up
greater
burden
on
your
tower
than
you're
putting
on
your
carrier
and
certainly,
this
can't
be
right,
but
congressional
philosophy,
obviously,
is
the
other
way
around.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no
sir,
not
to
my
knowledge.
the
southwestern
sugar
case
went
off
when
it
was
on
remand
on
the
question
of
the
merits.
and
the
southwestern
sugars
was
not
involved
in
that
in
label
--
the
label
case
went
off
on
the
question
of
bisso
on
the
basis
and
was
ruled
on
--
on
bisso's
basis.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
oh
no,
if
the
court
please.
there
is
only
one
rule
that
we
know
now
and
that's
the
rule
of
your
honors
in
bisso
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no,
no,
i
think
not.
in
this
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
there
are
certain
areas
of
holdings
where
the
court
has
held
that
you
must
use
the
word
negligence
--
negligent.
and
if
you
don't
use
it,
then
you're
out.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
yes,
the
fifth
circuit
said
they
would
look
at
the
whole
contract
and
they
would
determine
the
intent
of
the
parties
from
the
contract
and
they
would
not
rewrite
the
contract
from
--
for
the
parties
but
after
determining
intent,
they
would
hold
what
the
contract
said
and
in
this
case,
they
held
that
it
conclusively
and
inescapably
provided
for
a
shifting
of
liability.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
is
correct
if
the
court
please.
there
is
no
question
about
that
but
what
the
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
in
mr.
vickery's
petition
for
certiorari,
there
were
two
questions
raised.
first,
the
question
of
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
and
second,
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
bisso
rule
as
applied
to
this
case.
that
is
correct.
my
statement
was
that
i
thought
that
certiorari
was
granted
on
the
basis
of
the
bisso
situation
rather
than
on
the
contracting
interpretation.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
oh
yes.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
think
that
the
court
--
i
admit
it's
before
the
court,
yes,
whether
or
not
the
court
wishes
to
rule
on
it
of
course
it's
up
to
the
court.
but
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
oh,
i
don't
think
there's
any
conflict
in
the
circuits.
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be
because
it's
a
factual
conflict
of
the
interpretation
of
the
contract
obviously
is
factual
and
i
think
that
no
matter
what
you
say
about
your
fifth
circuit
using
the
word
negligence
as
a
so-called
talismanic
word
or
the
sixth
circuit
not
doing
it,
that
doesn't
create
a
conflict
in
the
two
circuits
in
the
sense
that
your
honor
refers
to.
this
is
simply
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
that
you're
in
my
circuit,
the
court
please.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
can't
agree
to
that
one
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
i
don't
think
it's
been
presented
if
the
court
please
in
any
other
circuit.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
but
this
is
a
first
case
up
that
i
know
of
in
this
area.
your
honors
refused
certiorari
in
label,
but
that
could
have
been
--
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
label
was
another
situation
involving
southwestern
sugars,
it
was
the
same
thing
and
for
all
practical
purposes
southwestern
sugars
could
have
been
decided
in
the
label
case.
both
of
those
involved
regulated
carriers,
an
icc
regulation.
mr.
charles
kohlmeyer,
jr.
no
sir,
if
the
court
please.
the
case
was
--
went
back
to
the
fifth
circuit
on
your
remand
and
there
went
off
on
the
factual
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
negligence
held
none.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
