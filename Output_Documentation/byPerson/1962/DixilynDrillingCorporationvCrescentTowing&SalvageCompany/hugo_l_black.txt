justice
hugo
l.
black
has
there
been
any
congressional
enactment
in
that
subject
sense?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there
has
been
in
the
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
did
the
bisso
case
come
from
originally?
justice
hugo
l.
black
fifth
circuit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
does
this
case
come
from?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
there
different
--
different
rules
for
this
kind
of
vessel
and
others
so
that
they
come
in
a
particular
category?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
in
reference
to
rates
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
insurance
rates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
is
this
kind
of
vessel
in
a
different
category
for
insurance
rates
than
the
regular
vessel?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
you
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
--
with
reference
to
insurance
rates,
what
would
be
the
difference?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
would
assume
if
the
bisso
rule
continues
to
apply,
it
might
make
a
difference
if
it
were
to
be
overruled.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
difference
in
rates,
would
it
or
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
prospectively.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
not
retroactively.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
would
--
they
couldn't
compensate
themselves
for
the
change
of
the
great
necess
--
necessary
change
in
rates
that
would
be
brought
about
by
increasing
the
liability.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
about
decreases?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you
have
here
is
a
question
of
--
which
insurance
company
would
pay.
what
kind
of
policy
rates
will
be
charged
with
this
particular
thing?
and
it
will
be
materially
affected
by
the
way
this
case
is
decided.
justice
hugo
l.
black
remaining
probably
stationary
this
though
as
left
as
it
was
but
changed
if
it's
overruled?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
about
the
sum
total
of
the
controversy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
is
rather
important
i
assume
in
their
business,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
bisso
should
be
overruled.
your
particular
insurance
company
here
would
be
in
no
way
to
make
up
what
is
lost,
wouldn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
wouldn't
do
any
good
isn't
it?
it's
only
applies
prospectively
to
others.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
your
client
had
a
right
to
rely
on
what
this
court
said
in
those
cases
and
onto
congress
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
suppose
they
do
not.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
the
reasons
that
the
court
gave
in
following
the
rule
and
considered
to
be
the
rule
were
not
adequate
reasons,
is
that
any
reason
why
the
rules
should
be
ignored?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
asking
to
overrule
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
why
i
can't
understand
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that's
what
the
courts
below
thought.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
does
that
affect
the
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
have
you
--
you've
produced
evidence
to
show
all
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
whatever
it
is,
it
is
true
isn't
it
that
in
bisso
and
the
cases
that
came
down
the
same
day,
we
held
that
a
contract
at
that
time
could
not
be
enforced
was
invalid.
justice
hugo
l.
black
whatever
it
was
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
here,
if
you
win,
it
has
to
be
held
that
that
rule
--
this
old
rule
completely
are
through
a
large
extent
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
we
held
--
if
we
held
as
i
thought
we
did
which
was
the
rule
which
was
enforced
contract
to
that
kind
were
invalid,
nobody
could
rely
on,
how
can
you
get
a
concurred
decision
here
without
overruling
the
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
exact
exemption
of
negligence
from
(voice
overlap)
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
isn't
that
an
exemption
from
liability?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
it
do
about
shifting
the
liability?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
i'm
wrong
but
i
thought
that
you
would
--
i
can
understand
that
you're
saying
bisso
was
wrong
and
ought
to
be
overruled,
but
i
frankly
cannot
understand,
i've
looked
at
the
record
carefully,
i
frankly
cannot
understand
how
you
can
say
that
we
would
have
to
overrule
it
to
decide
your
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
it
should
be.
i'm
not
saying
it
shouldn't.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what's
the
result
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
one
of
them
isn't
allowed
to
make
the
contract,
exemption
from
liability
for
his
own
negligence,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
a
different
language
which
was
--
what's
the
effect
of
it?
that
lawyer's
language
as
i
understand
it,
but
if
you
get
away
from
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
liability,
what
it
does
isn't
it,
honestly
and
frankly,
to
let
them
make
a
contract
which
exempt
themselves
from
liability
for
their
own
negligence.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they
used
different
words.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you're
saying
to
get
somebody
else.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
the
industry
feels
it
should
be
reversed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
don't
you
go
to
congress
and
get
it
changed
if
it's
all
that
important?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
think
it's
easier
to
get
this
court
to
overrule
its
decision
through
this
that
congress
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
would
ask
because
congress
thinks
the
law
is
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
court's
rule
because
the
court
has
ruled
it
40
years
before.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now
has
any
other
panel
in
this
fifth
circuit
passed
on
this
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
particular
way
of
getting
around
bisso
was
the
creation
of
the
fifth
circuit,
isn't
it,
no
other
one
has
even
suggested.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
a
fact?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
you
have
searched
about
this.
it's
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
--
has
any
other
circuit
held
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
label
hold?
