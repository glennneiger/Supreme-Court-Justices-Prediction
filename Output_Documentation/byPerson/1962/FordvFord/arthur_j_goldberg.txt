mr.

--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
before
you
proceed
with
your
argument,
would
you
mind
commenting
for
a
moment
on
what
appears
on
the
respondent's
brief
that
since
what
you
have
described
to
be
the
case,
and
since
certiorari
was
granted,
an
action
was
brought
--
a
divorce
action
was
brought
in
north
carolina.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
and
in
that
north
carolina
action,
the
lower
court,
the
court
having
jurisdiction
awarded
custody
to
the
father
with
secondary
custody
to
the
mother,
and
why
doesn't
that
moot
the
case
now?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
wasn't
there
a
jurisdiction
in
north
carolina
to
adjudicate
the
divorce?
and
didn't
your
client
appear
in
that
case?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
you
made
no
application
to
this
court
or
the
state
of
the
north
carolina
court
to
protect
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
in
other
words,
that
case
is
being
held
in
advance.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
on
appeal
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
but
there
is
a
decree
of
the
north
carolina
court
awarding
custody.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
mr.
marion,
if
your
view
is
what
you
say
it
to
be
in
the
broad
question,
then
doesn't
the
north
carolina
decision
moot
your
case
because
in
north
carolina,
didn't
the
court
make
a
finding
of
custody
on
what
the
best
interest
of
the
child
or
the
children.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well,
i
got
the
question
in
my
mind.
if
you
look
at
page
68
of
the
respondent's
brief,
the
court
does
refer
to
the
virginia
order
in
terms
such
as
you
have
fairly
described
it
i
think.
but
then
it
goes
on
and
says,
after
saying
so,
it
then
says
which
terms
of
the
agreement
meet
with
the
approval
of
this
court
and
this
court
finds
that
such
custodial
arrangement
is
in
the
best
interest
of
said
infant
children.
isn't
that
a
finding
on
the
merits
there?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
it's
right
above
that
in
the
virginia
--
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
right
--
it
is
right
above
that
--
few
sentences.
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
a
few
lines
above.
it
did
not
offer
to
show
any
change
of
circumstances,
then
isn't
this
a
conclusory
finding
right
after
that?
justice
arthur
j.
goldberg
well
didn't
they
--
well
didn't
they
in
this
court
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
both
agreed
that
throughout,
and
including
all
the
proceedings
up
to
the
north
carolina,
there
were
no
changes
in
circumstances
from
virginia.
that
is
not
a
point
in
issue
here.
