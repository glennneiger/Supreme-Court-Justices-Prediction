justice
john
m.
harlan
is
richmond
the
marriage
domicile?
justice
john
m.
harlan
your
last
point
involves
the
question
of
what
effect
virginia
would
give
to
its
own
decree.
justice
john
m.
harlan
you're
going
to
discuss
the
virginia
law.
justice
john
m.
harlan
but
you
have
to
reach
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
have
to
reach
--
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
broad
question
if
--
justice
john
m.
harlan
--
if
we
agree
with
you
that
virginia
law
would
have
permitted
the
virginia
courts
to
use
this
decree.
justice
john
m.
harlan
so
that
your
broad
question
is
not
necessarily
involved.
justice
john
m.
harlan
that's
a
great
point.
the
south
carolina
court
proceeded
on
the
basis
that
virginia
had
jurisdiction,
did
it
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
don't
quite
understand
--
the
purpose
of
my
question
is
i
don't
understand
quite
the
difference
between
your
first
framed
--
first
argument
on
this
virginia
law
and
your
second
one.
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
ultimately,
both
those
arguments
depend
on
what
virginia
law
is.
how
can
we
say
without
looking
at
virginia
law
whether
this
was
a
“judicial
proceeding”,
as
you
said,
it
was
not?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
i
suppose
you
say
to
that
that
the
south
carolina
court
is
acting
under
the
impact
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
therefore,
you
are
right.
this
case
ought
to
go
back
and
have
them
make
a
determination
whatever
it
may
be
freed
of
that
mistaken
assumption.
justice
john
m.
harlan
how
old
were
these
children?
