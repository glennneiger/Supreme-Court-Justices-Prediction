well,
mr.
marion
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
your
argument
really
come
down
to
this
in
substance
that
in
the
nature
of
things,
a
judgment
awarding
custody
of
children
can
never
be
final
for
the
purpose
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
because
it's
always
subject
to
amendment
or
modification
particularly
when
there
are
change
circumstances
and
it's
the
best
of
interest
of
the
children
not
to
be
amended.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
basically
what
you're
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
no
adjudication
of
the
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
independently
of
what
effect
virginia
would
give
to
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
this
judge
awarded
custody
to
the
mother?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
then,
he
certainly
didn't
suffer
by
any
act
of
proof.
