mr.
w.
francis
marion
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
comes
before
the
court
upon
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
the
question
involved
is
whether
in
an
order
of
dismissal
in
a
virginia
court
on
a
custody
matter,
full
faith
and
credit
should
have
been
given.
our
state
supreme
court
gave
full
faith
and
credit
to
an
order
of
dismissal
that
recited
in
effect
that
upon
representation
of
counsel
the
farthest
have
reached
an
agreement
and
that
the
case
is
therefore
dismissed.
so
briefly
and
factually,
the
petitioner
and
herman
ford
or
husband
and
wife
got
into
marital
difficulties
in
1959.
they
resided
in
sanford,
north
carolina
at
the
time.
both
of
their
homes
were
in
richmond,
virginia.
they
went
to
richmond,
virginia
for
purposes
of
seeing
a
marriage
counsel
or
psychiatrist.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
no
sir.
actually,
north
carolina
was
--
i
believe
they
were
originally
married
perhaps
in
virginia,
your
honor,
in
1952
but
they
had
moved
to
sanford,
north
carolina
after
living
in
various
places
around
the
world
actually.
but
when
they
came
to
richmond,
virginia
for
the
purposes
of
seeing
the
marriage
counselor,
the
respondent,
ford,
announced
that
his
wife
that
he
was
not
going
to
take
her
back.
he
left
three
small
children
at
that
time,
age
three,
five
and
seven
in
sanford,
north
carolina.
as
a
result
of
it,
she
went
back
by
herself
to
north
carolina
and
tried
to
locate
the
children
and
did
locate
the
children
and
they
go
to
court
in
the
companionship
of
a
german
nurse
who
lived
there.
she
brought
them
back
to
richmond,
virginia
to
the
home
of
her
mother
in
richmond,
virginia
and
ford
thereupon
instituted
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
in
the
city
and
county
civil
court
of
richmond.
an
exchange
between
counsel
followed
--
richmond
counsel
followed,
and
as
a
result
of
exchange
of
correspondence,
a
--
this
order
of
dismissal
that
was
not
displayed
to
the
court,
there
was
no
hearing
upon
the
order
whatsoever.
just
merely
that
counsel
had
said
to
the
court
that
an
agreement
had
been
reached;
therefore,
the
matter
is
dismissed.
it
was
thereupon
dismissed.
barbara
ford
that
was
in
august
of
1959,
she
subsequently
came
to
greenville,
south
carolina,
went
to
business
school,
obtained
a
job
in
greenville
and
in
january
of
1960,
her
youngest
child
was
brought
to
live
with
her.
the
two
older
children
in
the
meantime
were
living
in
sanford,
north
carolina
with
the
father
and
the
mother-in-law,
her
mother-in-law.
that
continued
until
the
summer
of
1960
at
which
time,
mrs.
ford,
the
petitioner,
brought
in
action
in
the
juvenile
court,
juvenile
and
domestic
relations
court
in
greenville,
south
carolina
to
obtain
custody
of
the
children.
herman
ford,
the
respondent
was
served
when
he
came
to
greenville
to
get
the
children.
he
was
served
at
that
point
and
a
hearing
was
held
in
greenville.
now,
this
was
the
first
time
there
was
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
this
case.
at
the
time,
11
witnesses
testified
including
the
minister,
the
--
all
the
parties
involved,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
an
order
was
issued
by
the
juvenile
and
domestic
relations
court
which
incidentally
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
this
malice
under
our
procedure.
an
order
was
issued
to
determine
that
custody
should
lie
with
the
mother
with
reasonable
visitation
to
the
father
during
the
holiday
period
and
that
is
if
they
could
work
that
part
out,
but
the
three
smaller
children
should
live
with
the
mother.
in
that
--
in
the
proceeding,
the
respondent
setup
before
the
domestic
relation
judge
in
his
pleadings
that
this
order
in
virginia,
this
order
of
dismissal
was
res
judicata
and
that
full
faith
and
credit
should
be
given.
the
juvenile
and
domestic
relations
judge
in
his
order
went
into
broader
detail
as
to
why
he
did
not
feel
that
full
faith
--
why
it
was
not
res
judicata,
that
it
wasn't
the
hearing
on
the
merits,
that
it
was
--
no
testimony
was
taken,
and
that
the
best
interest
of
the
children
were
not
being
served.
he
based
his
order
from
the
best
interest
of
the
three
minor
children,
three,
five
and
seven.
though
it
subsequently
appealed
to
the
state
circuit
court
which
is
the
intermediate
appeal
court
from
this
which
affirmed
the
order
of
the
juvenile
court
in
every
particular
--
all
of
them
saying
that
setting
up
a
specified
time
the
domestic
relations
court
had
said
that
they
shall
agree
as
to
a
time
when
he
could
visit.
he
setup
certain
specified
time
during
the
summer
and
christmas
holidays
but
otherwise
affirmed
it
and
again
went
into
detail.
and
his
order
--
the
circuit
judge,
in
his
order,
why
this
case
in
virginia
should
not
be
res
judicata
to
the
action
in
south
carolina
because
the
children's
interest
were
not
being
served
in
virginia
action,
it
has
never
been
demonstrated
to
the
virginia
court
what
the
children
--
the
rights
of
the
children.
they
were
simply
--
as
the
circuit
judge
said
were
raised.
not
even
before
the
court
in
virginia
on
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
was
not
before
the
court.
the
judge
never
saw
him,
never
took
in
the
testimony
of
the
best
interest.
and
that,
in
his
opinion,
the
south
carolina
order
was
correct
in
giving
custody
to
the
--
primary
custody
to
the
mother,
was
secondary,
in
effect,
custody
to
the
father
because
the
father
would
have
them
in
the
summertime.
that
was
subsequently
appealed
to
our
state
supreme
court
which
held
that
the
order
in
virginia
should
be
given
full
faith
and
credit
that
it
was
a
--
it
was
a
proceeding,
a
judicial
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
article
iv,
section
1
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
section
20,
title
28
that
defines
--
that
full
faith
and
credit
should
be
given
and
that
the
orders
of
the
circuit
and
the
domestic
relations
court
were
reversed.
we
filed
a
writ
of
certiorari
and
it
was
granted
upon
that
basis
that
full
faith
and
credit
should
not
be
given.
basically,
we
have
three
--
setup
three
reasons
where
why
any
of
which,
we
submit
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
does
not
moot
the
case.
i
think
that
the
united
--
the
north
carolina
court
was
without
jurisdiction
at
that
time
to
do
so
and
we
specifically
objected
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
north
carolina
court.
now
after
there
was
a
divorce
action
brought
by
herman
ford,
after
the
rendition
of
the
order
of
the
juvenile
court
in
south
carolina,
in
other
words,
that
he
was
there
in
personam
in
south
carolina,
fought
the
case
--
litigated
the
case
and
lost
it.
he
then,
under
the
north
carolina
statute,
brought
a
divorce
action
which
he
had
a
right
to
do
because
they
were
at
the
time
domiciled
in
north
carolina
on
the
grounds
of
adultery.
that
was
a
suit
was
filed
denying
that.
there
was
a
denial,
a
general
denial
put
in
only.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
they
appeared
--
yes
sir.
your
honor,
she
appeared
on
the
--
well,
if
i
may,
on
their
adultery
trial,
that
was
never
brought
up.
certainly,
they
have
a
section
in
north
carolina
that
has
the
two-year
separation
which
after
the
end
of
two
years,
that
was
--
she
did
not
contest
to
that.
in
other
words,
filed
an
appearance
through
counsel
not
contested
the
divorce,
all
of
which
were
subsequent
to
this
action.
the
counsel
for
respondent
in
their
brief
commented
this
was
forced
by
the
defendant
or
the
respondent
--
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
he
forced
that
action
into
trial,
the
only
action
that
was
forced
to
trial
was
it
was
apparent
on
that
action
--
divorce
action
in
north
carolina.
and
that
action
was
pushed
to
trial
at
the
end
of
two
years
to
get
it
off
the
docket
one
way
or
the
other.
we
did
not
consent
to
any
custody
matters.
they
were
subsequently
a
week
after
the
divorce
matter
was
heard.
they
were
heard
--
set
and
heard
a
custody
matter
of
which
the
counsel
in
north
carolina,
mrs.
mcdermott
appeared
solely
for
the
purpose
--
especially
for
the
purpose
of
objecting
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court
to
hear
the
custody
matter
at
all
because
the
custody
matter
had
been
decided
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
and
at
that
time,
was
under
an
order
of
this
court
issued
by
justice
frankfurter,
stating
all
matters
from
south
carolina
supreme
court
and
in
effect
reinstating
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
awarding
custody
to
mother.
judge
frankfurter
did
that
when
the
certiorari
was
pending
up
here.
we
objected
to
the
jurisdiction.
the
state
judge
in
north
carolina
disregarded
that
and
issued
an
order
not
on
any
change
of
circumstances
but
simply
that
the
virginia
order
was
found.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
we
--
we
know,
so
we
did
this.
we
applied
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
and
we're
successful
in
having
the
north
carolina's
judge
--
supreme
court
judge
of
the
north
carolina
court
stating
the
order
of
the
lower
court
in
north
carolina
and
that
was
done.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes
sir.
and
then
an
order,
may
it
please
the
court,
an
order
revoking
in
effect
there
by
the
supreme
--
the
chief
justice
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
which
actually
reinstates
the
order
of
the
south
carolina
court,
of
the
lower
court
in
south
carolina
and
ordered
the
children
back
to
south
carolina.
in
other
words,
as
soon
as
that
all
--
we
appeared
specially,
we
objected
to
it
in
the
lower
court
then
when
the
lower
court
issued
its
order,
we
thought
that
the
proper
procedure
was
to
go
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
and
if
they
refuse
it,
then
we
come
to
this
court.
but
they
didn't
refuse
it,
they
grant
it,
and
reinstated
the
order.
so,
we
submit
that
that
is
moot
as
far
as
that
case
is
down
there
concerned
because
it's
awaiting
the
decision
of
this
court
as
to
what
court
does
have
jurisdiction
of
the
matter.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
they
are
in
south
carolina
with
their
mother
up
by
reason
of
an
order
of
the
chief
justice
of
the
north
carolina
court
who
ordered
them
back
into
south
carolina
pursuant
to
the
south
carolina
order.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
no,
sir.
yes.
yes,
sir.
they
were
up
there.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
they
were
up
there
visiting
during
the
summer
under
the
order
of
the
south
carolina
court
that
said
the
children
should
be
with
the
father
during
the
summer
and
the
mother
during
school
months.
they
were
there
during
the
summer
months,
so
the
children
were
before
the
court
in
effect
in
north
carolina.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
no,
sir.
the
divorce
was
granted
upon
the
respondent,
brought
the
divorce
action.
the
--
the
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
they
brought
originally
the
divorce
action
and
it
was
granted
last
--
this
past
august
on
the
grounds
of
two
years
of
separation
which
they
have,
a
two-year
statute
in
north
carolina.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
that
is
stated
by
the
north
carolina
court
until
this
court
passes
upon
the
question
of
custody
in
effect.
it
is
before
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
though.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
but
it's
not
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
well,
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
they
would
for
the
reason
that
the
south
carolina
court
had
jurisdiction
on
the
matter
originally.
and
they
made
their
decision
based
upon
all
parties
before
them
that
the
north
carolina
court,
the
subsequent
decision
in
north
carolina
simply
ignored
the
south
carolina
order,
found
no
change
of
circumstances,
expressly
found
no
change
--
the
lower
court
found
no
change
of
circumstances
and
simply
ordered
them
back
because
of
this
original
virginia
action
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
--
and
they're
basing
it
solely
on
virginia.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
now
basically,
our
position
is
that
--
well,
there
are
three
positions.
either
that
the
court
is
in
the
position,
the
south
carolina
court
is
in
the
position
of
parens
patriae
which
is
our
third
question.
and
that
there's
only
committee
in
divorce
actions,
no
full
faith
and
credit
in
divorce
actions,
that
is
in
line
with
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion
in
may
against
anderson,
all
in
the
alternative,
we
--
that
the
south
carolina
court
didn't
have
to
give
--
they
can
give
full
faith
and
credit
only
to
the
extent
that
the
court
in
virginia
has
to
recognize
the
order
in
virginia.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
can
amend
in
virginia,
if
virginia
court
can
amend
its
order,
then
the
south
carolina
court
can
amend
its
order.
that
is
the
virginia
order
to
award
custody
under
halvey
against
halvey.
the
third
ground
and
i
think
in
this
instance
is
the
most
important
ground
and
i'll
put
them
in
the
inverse
is
that
the
virginia
order
was
not
a
judicial
proceeding
within
the
meaning
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution,
because
there
was
no
hearing,
no
testimony,
it
was
simply
an
order
of
dismissal,
voluntary
dismissal,
we
submit.
and
that
as
a
result
of
that,
the
south
carolina
court
would
not
have
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
because
in
virginia,
the
virginia
court
itself
would
not
find
that
the
original
action
was
res
judicata.
now,
all
of
these
that
the
law
relating
to
this
custody
matter
in
full
faith
and
credit
is,
frankly,
somewhat
up
in
the
air
under
the
decision
of
may
against
anderson
and
the
kovacs
against
brewer
and
state
against
halvey.
we
submit
though,
that
basically,
the
order
in
virginia
was
an
order
of
dismissal
whether
it
was
a
'dismissed
agreed'
as
counsel
for
respondent
claim
and
a
'dismissed
agreed'
by
way
of
regression
of
the
minute
under
virginia
law
is
what
i
would
call
a
non-suit
with
prejudice,
that
you
are
non-suiting
yourself
with
prejudice.
we
submit
that
whether
it
was
a
simple
order
of
dismissal
or
‘dismissed
agreed'
order
that
the
virginia
court
would
have
the
right
to
review
that
order
for
the
best
interest
of
the
children.
what
was
the
best
interest?
there
was
no
hearing
held
on
that
in
virginia.
therefore,
that
matter
had
never
come
before
the
virginia
court.
it
came
before
the
court
for
the
first
time
in
south
carolina.
that
is,
what
is
the
best
interest
of
the
children?
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
the
virginia
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
i'm
going
a
little
further
than
that
at
one
of
my
points,
yes.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
we
are
asking
you
to
do
that.
the
virginia
law
has
clearly,
we
submit,
a
'dismissed
agreed'
section.
there
are
four
cases
that
we
found
in
this
in
the
virginia
courts
that
had
a
‘dismissed
agreed'
order
which
is
an
order
with
prejudice,
all
involving
contractual
relationships,
none
of
which
involved
domestic
relationships.
that
is
custody
matters
at
all.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
and
we
have
cited
them
in
our
brief,
particularly
at
page
12
of
our
brief,
the
martin
against
martin
and
(inaudible)
several
cases
relating
to
custody
matters
where
the
court
reviewed
its
own
order
and
opened
up
an
order
for
trial
for
prior
adjudication
of
the
matter
even
if
it
was
in
adjudication.
now,
basically,
i'll
go
back
to
the
point
and
i
can't
stress
it
too
much
in
my
own
mind
that
this
original
habeas
corpus
action
was
--
there
was
no
hearing
on
the
merits,
no
--
nobody
appear.
so
there's
some
question
of
whether
that
was
actually
adjudication
of
the
matter,
but
assuming,
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
it
was
an
adjudication,
then
under
virginia
law,
we
submit,
under
the
semmes
case,
the
semmes
and
a
wrap
of
cases,
the
court
could
review
its
own
order
and
a
man
in
any
way
it's
all
fair
under
change
of
condition
or
change
of
circumstances.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
that
is
basically
one
of
our
main
arguments
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
your
honor,
one
of
the
three
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
that's
exactly
right
because
that
was
what
i
was
going
on
to
add
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
that's
correct.
now,
our
broad
question
is
our
third
question
that
we
took
up
in
our
brief
and
our
second
question
is
the
one
relating
to
the
virginia
law
in
the
erroneous
interpretation
in
effect
to
the
virginia
law
by
the
south
carolina
court
on
full
faith
and
credit.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
part
of
that
--
that
part,
your
honor,
has
warranted
me
a
great
deal
but
i
think
not
because
the
court
did
not
make
any
finding,
the
north
carolina
court
based
its
order
solely
upon
the
virginia
order
as
i
understand
it
--
i
mean
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
i
don't
point
so
in
this
respect,
your
honor
that
they
make
the
specific
finding,
and
i
was
trying
to
put
my
finger
on
it
while
you
were
reading
it.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
that
there
was
no
change
of
--
change
of
circumstances
in
this
--
between
the
time
of
the
virginia
order
and
this
one,
that
there
had
been
no
change
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
well,
your
honor,
we
submit
not
and
we
submit
that
north
carolina
supreme
court
will
agree
on
us
in
that
respect
because
we
appeared
especially
to
object
to
the
jurisdiction
and
to
--
did
not
put
--
there
was
no
testimony
taken.
now,
i
think
there
were
two
grounds
whether
this
wouldn't
affect
us.
one
is
that
the
--
their
finding
is
such
that
there
had
been
no
change
which
we
submit
can
ease
the
record.it
shows
that
there
have
been
plenty
of
changes.
and
secondly,
there
was
no
testimony
taken
upon
this
from
the
respondent
whatsoever.
the
only
testimony
was
relating
really
to
this
order
in
virginia
and
the
testimony
of
one
counsel
and
there
is
not
as
pertaining
to
that
but
there
was
no
testimony
from
the
petitioner
--
i
said
respondents,
excuse
me,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
but
no
testimony
up
at
the
time
because
this
court
had
issued
its
order
restraining
in
effect
and
reinstating
the
south
carolina
order
and
we
didn't
think
it
was
proper
at
that
time.
we
thought
we
would
waive
our
rights,
so
to
speak,
if
we
took
that
into
consideration.
but
i
do
feel
very
strongly
that
in
the
broad
question,
that
we
don't
have
to
get
to
it
if
the
court
doesn't
want
to
pass
upon
the
broad
question
at
this
time
which
they
did
not
in
the
kovacs
case
or
in
may
against
anderson
or
in
the
halvey
case.
the
broad
question
has
not
been
passed
upon
by
the
court
and
it
does
not
have
to
be
passed
upon
by
the
court
in
this
case
if,
number
one,
our
first
question
that
the
order
in
virginia
really
was
not
a
judicial
proceeding
then
we
have
to
go
no
further
than
that.
number
two,
if
it
was
a
judicial
proceeding
that
the
virginia
court
could
amend
its
own
order,
therefore,
the
south
carolina
court
err
in
not
amending,
allowing
to
be
amended.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
the
lower
court
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
they
had
jurisdiction
which
--
admittedly,
your
honor,
they
had
jurisdiction
of
the
mother
and
the
father
by
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
but
it
was
simply
a
voluntary
dismissal,
we
submit,
without
any
matters
being
settled
between
the
courts.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
well,
the
first
one
is
that
we
don't
think
that
it
is
a
judicial
proceeding,
that
first,
the
virginia
order
was
a
judicial
proceeding
within
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
and
as
defined
by
title
28.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
that
there
was
no
adjudication
of
the
merits
originally
in
virginia.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
that's
independently.
that's
our
first
ground
that
there
was
no
adjudication.
therefore,
there's
nothing
to
give
full
faith
and
credit
to
whether
there
has
not
been
an
adjudication.
but
secondly,
if
it
was
an
adjudication,
then
the
court
erred
is
not
going
into
the
virginia
law
and
seeing
what
could
be
amended
or
modified
under
the
virginia
law.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
well,
yes,
i
think
you
do
and
we
have
cited
throughout
our
brief,
the
virginia
law
and
as
i
recall
in
title
28
in
supplementing
or
implementing
the
united
states
constitutional
law
article
iv
section
1
says
according
to
the
law
and
usage
of
the
court
as
to
whether
it's
a
judicial
proceeding
and
the
facts
of
the
case
were
reviewed
by
the
south
carolina
lower
courts
and
found
after
testimony
was
taken
that
that
was
not
a
judicial
proceeding.
yet
our
supreme
court
ignored
the
facts
of
the
case
and
put
it
on
the
question
of
law
that
it
just
was
a
judicial
proceeding,
but
the
law
of
both
decided
in
our
brief
particularly
in
question
two
of
our
brief,
we
go
into
the
law
of
virginia
on
what
is
the
final
order
and
what
is
not
a
final
order.
and
we
submit
that
the
order
that
simply
said
without
taking
any
testimony
that
it
wouldn't
define
the
law,
couldn't
be.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
not
--
a
change
of
circumstances?
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes
sir,
not
a
change
of
condition,
which
i
think
is
a
little
bit
different
in
change
of
circumstances.
i
don't
think
it
would
have
to
be
affirmatively
plain.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
that's
right
sir.
we
--
we
--
mr.
w.
francis
marion
no,
sir.
we
do
agree
with
that.
and
if
assuming
those
facts,
if
it
was
litigated,
we
would
agree
that
they
couldn't
relitigate
the
same
issue.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
no,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
no,
sir.
there
would
not
because
except
that
they
made
that
statement,
if
i
may,
that
was
a
dicta
statement
in
their
opinion
and
the
--
there
were
plenty
of
circumstances
within
the
opinion
to
put
itself
within
the
facts
in
the
records
to
show
a
change.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
i
understand
that.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
i
understand
that
sir,
but
what
i
was
saying
though
is
that
the
impact,
what
i
think
they
were
intending
to
say
that
the
impact
of
full
faith
and
credit
and
that
the
other
was
to
procure.
i
don't
think
they
intended
to
go
that
far,
it's
what
i
was
getting
at.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
we
submit
that
it's
dicta
your
honor
and
that
it
should
be
sent
back
because
these
dicta
would
be
unnecessary
to
the
opinion
of
the
case,
decision
of
the
case
and
that
we
should
have
that
right
to
determine
that.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
they
were
at
the
time
three,
five,
and
seven.
they
are
now
five,
seven,
and
nine.
but
at
the
time,
the
youngest
was
three
years
old,
the
next
one
five,
and
other
is
seven.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
they
had
been
in
there
only
about
three
months.
well,
the
youngest
child
had
been
there
about
six
to
seven,
nine
months.
the
other
two
children
had
come
down
at
the
start
of
the
summer
under
the
agreement
decided,
the
private
agreement
between
the
parties
through
their
counsel
apparently
in
richmond.
an
agreement
had
been
made
that
the
children
would
stay
in
sanford
and
that
the
--
until
the
school
--
during
the
school
year
with
the
mother
otherwise.
the
mother
testified
that
that
was
of
a
temporary
arrangement.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
have
they
been
in
greenville?
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
yes.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes.
they're
living
with
their
mother
and
still
are,
except
for
going
back
for
the
summer.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
no,
sir.
i
think
they
could
offer
testimony
of
the
decree
of
that
--
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
i
think
that
testimony
if
i
--
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
correctly,
i
think
the
testimony,
if
it
were
amended
that
the
testimony
could
further
--
the
testimony
could
be
taken
as
i
understand
it
correctly,
the
question.
mr.
w.
francis
marion
yes,
i
think
so.
