a.
ford.
would
you
wait
just
a
moment
please,
we'll
be
ready.
mr.
aronstein,
i
--
i
just
overlook
the
fact
that
this
court
had
appointed
you
to
or
you
were
appointed
by
the
court
to
defend
this
--
chief
justice
earl

--
represent
this
man
and
i
just
want
to
express
the
appreciation
of
the

public
service.

always
a
comfort

and
helpful

in
which
you

presented
your
public
agency
too.
thank
you
both
gentlemen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
mr.
marion,
you
may
proceed
with
your
case.
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
are
the
children
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
the
north
carolina
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
the
children
at
the
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
children
were
there.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
status
of
that
divorce
case?
is
it
--
had
it
been
appealed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
the
respondent
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
there
--
is
there
an
appeal
from
the
order
of
custody
in
the
--
in
the
north
carolina
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
is
that
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
is
on
appeal
before
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
the
north
carolina
court
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
this
--
would
this
case
be
dispositive
of
that
issue
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
if
the
children
were
actually
there
in
north
carolina
under
the
jurisdiction
of
that
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
see.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
walker.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
--
pardon
me
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
who
brought
the
case
to
trial
on
this
motion.
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
proceed
in
the
north
carolina
case
on
the
theory
that
the
virginia
decree
dismissing
that
original
case,
controlled
the
situation
so
far
as
the
children
are
concerned
or
did
you
--
did
you
have
a
hearing
on
what
is
the
best
interest
of
the
children?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
set
up
--
did
you
set
up
the
decree
of
virginia
as
being
determinative
of
the
custody
of
the
children
or
did
you
pursue
--
proceed
on
the
theory
that
north
carolina
had
jurisdiction
over
the
children.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
it's
your
position
then
that
if
there
were
a
change
of
circumstances,
that
the
court
in
south
carolina
even
if
it
would
have
jurisdiction
over
the
children?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
was
it
conceded
in
the
south
carolina
case
that
there
was
no
change
of
circumstances?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
ask
you
if
it
was
conceded
that
in
that
proceeding
that
there
had
been
no
change
of
circumstances
since
the
virginia
decree.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
there
were,
where
will
i
find
that
from
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
does
not
say
that
--
does
that
say
that
the
conditions
are
the
same?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
it
might
not
have
been
necessary
to
prove
the
father
is
unfit
to
have
a
change
in
the
custody
of
the
children.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
does
--
how
would
the
--
how
would
the
judge
of
the
lower
court
in
north
--
in
south
carolina
know
that
there
were
no
change
of
conditions
because
there
was
no
--
no
evidence
of
any
kind
in
the
virginia
court.
there
was
no
--
there
were
no
findings
of
any
kind
by
any
court.
it
was
just
dismissed
by
the
party.
so
how
would
he
know
whether
there
are
any
change
of
conditions
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
exactly.
chief
justice
earl
warren
since
the
virginia
decree.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
notice
in
the
--
on
page
6
of
the
transcript
at
paragraph
4
of
the
amended
complaint,
i
think
if
that's
a
complaint
of
a
--
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
he
says
that
this
plaintiff
was
informed
and
believes
that
for
the
benefit
of
the
minor
children
of
the
parties
that
she
is
the
proper
person
to
have
the
control
of
custody
of
said
children,
5,
that
the
plaintiff
is
informed
and
believed
that
the
defendant
has
been
miss
--
the
guilty
of
misconduct
and
there's
an
unfit
person
to
have
custody
of
the
minor
children
of
the
parties.
the
plaintiff
alleges
that
she
is
entitled
reasonable
support
for
herself
and
for
the
minor
children
of
the
parties,
why
isn't
that
an
allegation
of
the
(voice
overlap).
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
said
he
wouldn't
go
to
hear
anymore
witnesses,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
apparently,
wasn't
that
the
end
of
the
case,
you
say
here
--
or
it
says
in
the
record
on
page
33
that
the
judge
of
the
court
stated
on
the
record
during
presentation
of
plaintiff's
case,
“before
going
on
to
the
next
witness,
both
parties
are
good
people,
good
family,
good
parents,
i
am
going
to
exclude
any
further
testimony
as
to
their
faithfulness
as
parents.
they
are
good
parents.
they
love
their
children
and
so
forth”.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so,
how
do
you
know
what
they
would
have
presented
if
they
had
an
opportunity?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
do
you
know
what
the
plaintiff
might
have
shown
if
she
had
had
an
opportunity.
the
judge
said
he
wasn't
going
to
hear
anymore.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
they
said
--
my
point
is
simply
this.
what
does
he
mean
by
saying,
“i
am
going
to
exclude
any
further
testimony
as
to
their
faithfulness
as
parents”
when
the
--
when
there
was
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
said
that
the
plaintiff
has
informed
and
believes
that
the
defendant
has
been
guilty
of
misconduct
and
he's
an
unfit
person
to
have
custody
of
the
minor
children.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
can
they
prove
it
if
he
won't
let
them
prove
it
by
presenting
witnesses?
chief
justice
earl
warren
back
to
the
first
question
i
asked
you,
you
didn't
respond
in
that
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
alright.
it's
alright.
you
go
on
with
other
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
part
of
the
course
purpose
is
all
--
i
took
a
lot
of
your
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
you
answer
it
that
way
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
i
would
have
been
through.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
we'll
recess
now.
