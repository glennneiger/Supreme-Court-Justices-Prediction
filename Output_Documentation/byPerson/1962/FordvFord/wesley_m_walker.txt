mr.
wesley
m.
walker
mr.
chief
justice,
associate
justices,
and
members
of
the
court.
there
is
and
has
been
much
disagreement
throughout
the
proceedings
as
to
facts.
i
submit
that
there
is
an
extensive
recitation
of
the
facts
in
the
opinion
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
and
i
will
not
belabor
that
particular
point.
the
facts
in
the
record,
there
had
been
substantial
or
extensive
statements
made
by
petitioner
in
her
brief,
also
by
respondent
in
his
brief.
i
say
that
at
the
beginning,
there
was
a
custody
proceeding
in
virginia.
it
was
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
that
was
instituted
for
the
custody
of
these
minor
children
and
that
is
the
proper
proceedings
in
virginia
to
obtain
and
to
determine
the
custody
of
the
children.
following
the
custody
proceeding
in
virginia
and
the
order
‘dismissed
agreed',
under
which
agreement
and
order,
the
children
or
the
primary
custody
of
the
children
was
given
to
the
respondent.
it
was
some
time
following
that
that
the
petitioner
moved
to
greenville,
south
carolina,
and
at
that
point,
because
of
the
question
of
mr.
justice
black
with
respect
to
the
length
of
time,
these
children
had
been
in
greenville,
i
wish
to
state
what
the
record
will
show
and
what
is
the
fact.
it
was
sometime
in
late
february
of
1960
when
the
respondent
here,
the
father,
agreed
for
the
three-year-old
child
to
stay
for
a
period
of
time
with
the
mother
in
greenville,
south
carolina.
however,
that
child,
the
youngest
child,
returned
to
the
custody
of
the
father
as
provided
under
the
order
‘dismissed
agreed'
and
the
agreement
in
virginia
to
the
father
at
the
end
of
may,
and
the
three
children
did
not
come
to
greenville,
south
carolina
to
see
their
mother.
under
the
terms
of
this
agreement
which
the
father,
respondent,
scrupulously
obeyed
until
the
latter
part
of
june,
1960,
and
it
was
within
approximately
six
weeks
following
that
that
the
mother
instituted
this
action
in
greenville
for
the
custody
of
these
children.
and
as
the
record
will
show,
it
happened
upon
an
occasion
when
the
father
had
come
to
greenville
to
see
his
children
and
to
tell
them
of
the
death
of
his
mother.
and
at
that
time,
he
was
served
with
process
and
this
action
was
instituted
in
the
juvenile
and
domestic
relations
court
of
greenville
county.
following
upon
the
order
of
that
court,
the
matter
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
common
pleas.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
the
juvenile
and
domestic
relations
court
gave
custody
to
the
mother.
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
common
pleas.
i
disagree
with
my
able
friend
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
juvenile
and
domestic
relations
court
is
exclusive.
the
court
of
common
pleas
is
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
south
carolina.
its
powers
are
vested
by
the
constitution
and
that
power
cannot
be
and
has
not
been
cut
down
or
diminished
by
the
legislature.
the
court
of
common
pleas
then
gave
according
to
the
words
of
its
decree
joint
custody
and
expressly
put
custody
in
both
towns.
however,
the
court
of
common
pleas
did
not
recognize
or
accept
the
defense
that
the
respondent
had
then
opposed
as
to
the
virginia
decree
being
a
valid
decree
and
being
res
judicata
to
the
issues
that
were
in
the
south
carolina
court.
following
upon
that
decree
of
the
court
of
common
pleas,
there
was
the
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
south
carolina
and
that
court
issued
its
opinion
and
following
upon
that
we
are
here
pursuant
to
the
petitioners
and
this
court's
order
of
certiorari
to
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
at
that
point,
if
i
may,
i
wished
to
make
certain
of
the
correctness
of
what
transpired
in
north
carolina
and
particularly
queen.
the
action
in
north
carolina
which
was
undisputedly
the
marital
domicile
of
the
parties
and
of
these
children,
the
action
in
north
carolina
was
instituted
by
the
respondent
here
in
december
of
1959.
that
was
an
action
in
the
superior
court
of
lee
county,
north
carolina
for
divorce
and
custody
of
the
children.
that
action
was
instituted
at
a
time
when
the
order
of
the
juvenile
and
domestic
relations
court
had
just
been
issued
but
when
the
children
were
in
north
carolina
with
their
father,
the
respondent,
pursuant
to
and
under
the
terms
of
the
agreed
order
of
dismissal
and
the
agreement
in
the
virginia
court.
now,
that
action
in
north
carolina
did
not
come
on
to
trial
until
this
past
august
of
1962.
the
action,
as
i
have
stated,
was
instituted
prior
to
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
common
pleas
in
south
carolina.
but
there
was
only
one
action
instituted
in
the
superior
court
of
north
carolina
at
the
marital
domicile
and
that
action
was
for
divorce
and
custody.
there
has
never
been
any
separation
of
the
actions
and
a
separation
of
the
counts
if
they
might
be
termed
that
and
that
action,
we
submit,
was
brought
to
trial
upon
the
motion
of
petitioner's
counsel
in
north
carolina.
and
that
motion
is
printed
at
page
64
that
is
the
order
of
the
court.
and
the
superior
court
of
lee
county,
north
carolina,
the
order
of
the
court
pursuant
to
petitioner's
motion
is
printed
on
page
64
of
the
appendix
to
respondent's
briefs.
and
i
particularly
call
this
court's
attention
to
that
order
because
that
order
was
issued.
first,
i
say,
the
motion
was
made
by
petitioner's
north
carolina
counsel
in
the
superior
court
of
north
carolina
after
the
stay
had
been
issued
in
this
course
by
mr.
justice
frankfurter
stating
the
order
--
the
enforcement
of
the
order
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
petitioner's
north
carolina
counsel
made
this
motion
and
as
we'll
be
seeing,
the
court
says,
this
cause
is
coming
on
to
be
heard
on
motion
of
(inaudible)
harrington,
counsel
for
the
defendant
who
is
the
petitioner
here.
and
it
was
said
upon
her
motion
peremptorily,
it
did
proceed
to
trial
in
august
and
there
the
issues
were
met.
first,
the
divorce
was
granted
by
the
jury.
two
days
later
in
the
same
setting,
the
judge
heard
the
custody
issued.
he
made
his
award
the
order
being
likewise
printed
in
the
appendix
to
this
brief.
did
you
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
excuse
me,
chief
justice.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
think
that
it
has
significance
in
this
light
that
they
have
charged
us
with
the
proceeding
and
the
respondent
and
that
based
on
the
order
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
stating
the
enforcement
of
the
south
carolina
order
and
they
had
the
right
to
make
a
motion
to
bring
it
onto
trial.
but
my
friend
here
said
that
the
entire
proceedings
in
north
carolina
have
been
stayed,
that
they
are
being
held
in
advance.
now
the
only
thing
that
it's
being
stayed
is
the
order
of
the
chief
justice
of
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
who
stayed
the
enforcement
of
the
order
of
lee
county
but
that
appeal
has
gone
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
and
has
been
argued
there.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
they
were
both,
your
honor.
there
was
a
testimony
taken.
a
testimony
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
if
your
honor
please,
it
was
proceeded
on
the
basis
originally
that
north
carolina
had
jurisdiction
of
the
children
and
of
the
parties.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
and
the
case
went
on
to
trial.
and
at
the
trial,
there
was
a
testimony
given
by
the
respondent.
the
petitioner
here,
although
she
was
in
a
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
she
failed
to
personally
come
in
and
testify
and
her
counsel
stated
at
the
trial
that
there
was
no
claim
by
them
of
any
change
of
circumstances
subsequent
to
the
virginia
decree.
and
to
complete
the
answer,
the
issue
that
is
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
‘dismissed
agreed'
order
of
the
virginia
court
was
injected
into
the
trial
before
the
judge
of
lee
county
of
the
superior
court.
it
was
argued
by
us,
that
is
the
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
there,
the
respondent
here
that
the
north
carolina
court
was
required
to
give
to
the
order
of
the
virginia
court
the
same
faith
and
credit
that
it
would
receive
in
virginia.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
no
question
of
that.
the
opinion
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
plainly
stated
that
the
matter
of
custody
of
the
children,
the
issue
is
never
final.
and
that
it
can
be
varied
by
the
court
with
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
at
anytime
upon
the
showing
of
a
change
of
circumstances.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
there
had
been
no
claim
of
it
and
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
moss
of
the
south
carolina
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
according
to
my
interpretation,
i
answer
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
would
go
back
to
the
original
statement
made
by
the
judge
of
the
--
made
by
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
domestic
relations
court.
i
would
refer
to
page
33
of
the
transcript,
and
right
at
that
point,
i'm
pointing
to
the
respondents,
respondent
here
is
exceptions
to
the
court
of
common
pleas.
and
i
refer
there
in
those
exceptions
and
quoted
what
the
judge
of
the
juvenile
and
domestic
relations
court
said
during
the
presentation
of
the
plaintiff's
case
who
is
the
petitioner
here.
toward
the
bottom,
i
believe,
40123
that
during
the
presentation
of
defendant's
case,
there
is
the
respondent
here.
the
judge
stated
on
the
record,
“mr.
walker,
i
understand
you
are
gong
to
undertake
to
prove
the
fitness
of
the
father
of
the
children.”
they
have
not
attacked
yet.
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
it
does
because
they
made
no
other
contention
with
respect
to
any
change
in
the
circumstances.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
think
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
they
are
--
the
facts
of
this
case
--
pleadings,
there
would
have
been
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
now,
your
question
is
how
would
the
judge
in
the
south
carolina
court
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
--
have
known
whether
there
were
any
change?
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
think
that
there
would
be
no
way
that
he
could
know
unless
the
parties
--
the
petitioner
here
offered
proof
of
change
of
circumstances,
unless
he
made
some
allegation
of
it
and
offered
proof
of
the
pleadings
that
make
the
issues
in
the
case
of
course,
and
unless
the
petitioner
offered
some
proof
of
a
change
of
circumstances,
then
of
course
the
judge
could
not
know.
and
here,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
found
that
there
was
neither
allegation
nor
proof
of
a
change
of
circumstance.
and
that
must
be
conclusive
in
a
court
of
law
--
in
a
court
of
record.
if
they
don't
attempt
to
prove
it,
if
they
don't
even
allege
it,
then
certainly,
no
trial
court
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
or
any
other
matter
would
go
beyond
the
pleadings
and
the
proof
of
the
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
change
of
circumstances.
no
claim
of
it.
it
was
conclusive
upon
the
court.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
you
will
find
that
on
page
206
and
beginning
with
the
first
paragraph
there,
the
first
indentation
at
the
top
of
the
page
on
206.
and
we
emphasize
that
entire
paragraph
to
this
court
because
of
the
--
there
the
south
carolina
court
was
applying
the
south
carolina
law.
and
the
south
carolina
court
after
applying
the
south
carolina
law,
citing
its
own
authority
and
saying
a
judicial
award
of
the
custody
of
a
child
is
never
found.
and
then
saying,
applying
this
rule
to
the
instant
case
and
after
examining
the
pleadings
and
the
entire
record,
we
find
neither
allegation
nor
proof
of
any
change
of
circumstances,
authorizing
a
change
of
custody
of
the
minor
children
of
the
parties
of
this
action.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
think
that
is
not
an
allegation
of
change
of
circumstance
and
that
would
be
the
very
reason
i
would
point
to
the
statement
that
i
did
a
few
moments
ago
of
the
judge
of
the
trial
court,
that
is
the
juvenile
and
domestic
relations
court
who
said
to
me
in
the
trial
they
have
not
attacked
the
respondent's
fitness.
now,
he
wouldn't
go
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
he
said
at
the
end
of
--
yes,
sir.
at
the
end
of
that
case
and
when
we
propose
witnesses
as
to
the
fitness
of
this
respondent,
then
he
said
that
there's
no
use
to
hear
anymore.
he
said
that
the
--
that
they
have
not
attacked
the
character,
and
the
reputation
and
the
fitness
of
the
respondent
here.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
and
he
say
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
that
was
because
they
offered
no
evidence
with
respect
to
the
plaintiffs
or
with
respect
to
the
defendant
there,
respondent
here,
as
testimony.
if
they
had
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
the
answer
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
though
they
alleged
it,
they
did
not
account
to
prove
it.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
oh
but
he
did.
he
said,
“i
am
not
going
to
take
any
further
evidence.
he
didn't
say
that
“i'm
going
at
the
outset
of
the
trial.
i
will
exclude
evidence.”
there
was
a
testimony
in
that
record
as
to
the
fitness
of
the
respective
parents.
the
testimony
was
presented
sir
but
he
said,
“i'm
not
going
to
take
any
further.”
there
were
numerous
people
who
would
testify
as
to
the
fitness
and
good
character
of
each.
and
he
said,
“it's
obvious
that
they
are
both
good
parents”.
he
found
that
and
he
said
immediately,
i
think
it
was
following
upon
that,
to
me,
when
i
propose
to
put
witnesses
up
as
to
the
fitness
of
the
respondent
here.
that
was
where
he
said,
“i
understand
you're
going
to
undertake
to
prove
it.”
he
said,
“they
have
not
attacked
it.”
and
i
answer
you,
mr.
chief
justice
by
saying
that
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
true
they
did
allege
in
the
complaint,
that
is
the
complaint
in
the
juvenile
and
domestic
relations
court,
that
the
defendant,
respondent
here
was
an
unfit
person.
if
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
yes,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
no
sir,
not
in
that
--
not
in
that
judge's
order.
no,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
that
is
not
a
point
in
issue
here.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
ask
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
well,
as
i
understood
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
--
the
question,
it
was
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
it
was
the
extent
to
which
they
had
conceded.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
well,
i
understood
you
too
inquire
if
they
had
made
a
concession
into
the
record,
i
think
that
there
is
no
issue,
no
controversy
about
it,
but
if
you
had
then
asked
me
where
would
you
find
that
in
the
record
and
i
think
you
did,
i
cannot
point
to
a
place
in
the
record
where
counsel
for
petitioner
says
expressly,
we
make
no
question
of
change
of
circumstances
other
than
in
the
trial
of
the
north
carolina
case.
now,
if
they
did
make
that
statement
to
the
court,
now
again,
the
judge
of
the
superior
court
of
lee
county
stated
that
in
his
order
that
there
was
no
contention
of
change
of
circumstances
by
either
party.
we
think
that
the
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
or
as
to
the
minor
children,
any
change
of
circumstances
with
respect
to
this
course.
there
was
no
contention
of
that
and
it
was
so
stated
into
the
record
in
the
trial
of
the
north
carolina
case.
and
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
as
i
have
heretofore
stated,
held
that
there
was
neither
allegation
nor
proof
of
a
change
of
circumstances.
we
think
that
to
view
this
matter,
we
think
that
the
question
as
set
forth
on
page
1
in
the
question
presented
in
the
brief
of
respondent
is
a
proper
statement
of
the
question
before
this
court.
and
to
view
from
there,
we
say
that
we
must
look
and
see
what
was
held
by
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
if
i
may
point
that
up
quickly
we
say
first,
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
held
that
the
virginia
order
was
‘dismissed
agreed',
a
‘dismissed
agreed'
order
under
the
virginia
practice.
second,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
held
that
the
judgment
was
res
judicata
in
virginia
of
the
issues
before
the
virginia
court.
third,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
held
that
virginia
courts
would
recognize
and
be
bound
by
the
decree
in
the
absence
of
changed
circumstances.
fourth,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
determined
the
south
carolina
law
and
held
that
upon
a
proper
showing,
the
court
could
make
a
further
disposition
of
the
child
if
new
facts
and
circumstances
made
it
desirable
or
proper
for
the
best
interest
of
the
child
and
expressly
held
that
a
judicial
award
of
custody
of
a
child
is
never
final.
then
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
applied
the
south
carolina
rule
to
that
holding
and
held
that
the
entire
record
contained
neither
allegations
nor
proof
of
a
change
of
circumstances.
the
south
carolina
court
further
held
that
the
‘dismissed
agreed'
order
of
the
virginia
court
was
a
bar
to
this
action
between
the
same
parties
for
the
same
cause
in
the
absence
of
any
change
of
circumstances.
we
think
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
reached
the
same
result
in
its
opinion
that
would
have
been
reached
by
application
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
or
by
rules
of
committee.
therefore,
the
petitioner
alleges
here
a
constitutional
question
on
the
premise
that
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
precluded
from
inquiring
into
the
best
interest
of
the
welfare
of
the
minor
children.
they
contend
that
the
south
carolina
court
held
that
it
was
precluded
by
the
virginia
decree
and
we
submit
that
that
is
not
the
finding
of
the
south
carolina
supreme
court.
the
south
carolina
court
held
that
the
south
carolina
law
would
be
properly
applied
here,
it
did
apply.
now,
we
say
that
what
they
would
attempt
to
do
is
to
say
that
it
was
not
res
judicata
and
he
said,
not
res
judicata
even
if
it
was
‘dismissed
agreed'
and
the
virginia
cases
to
which
they
would
point
and
one
i
believe
that
would
come
the
closest
to
it
would
be
the
buchanan
case
which
is
cited
in
their
brief.
and
i
particularly
call
the
court's
attention
there
that
those
cases
which
they
cited
referred
to
a
contract
made
in
virginia
prior
to
the
institution
of
the
litigation.
that
is
not
the
case
here
as
to
what
happened
in
virginia.
here,
the
agreement
was
made.
it
was
negotiated.
it
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
order
‘dismissed
agreed'
of
the
virginia
court.
now,
with
respect
to
parens
patriae,
we
submit
to
this
court
that
parens
patriae
has
no
place
when
--
no
standing,
when
in
direct
conflict
with
a
mandate
of
the
constitution,
we
further
say
that
here,
the
south
carolina
supreme
court
carefully
examined
the
record
and
supplied
the
very
thing
that
the
kovacs
case
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
black
was
sent
back
to
north
carolina
to
determine.
here,
the
south
carolina
went
into
that.
it
founded
according
to
its
own
law.
it
applied.
and
that
very
deficiency
or
the
reason
that
this
court
sent
back
the
kovacs
case
here
--
is
applied
in
the
case
here.
we
contend
in
conclusion
that
under
the
mandate
of
the
--
of
the
constitution,
the
mandate
of
article
iv
section
1
that
it
is
equally
as
strong
with
respect
to
a
child
custody
case
as
to
other
cases
because
a
custody
decree
is
a
judicial
decree
and
it
cannot
be
stated
otherwise
and
there
is
no
exception
in
the
mandate
of
the
constitution
with
respect
to
a
custody
decree.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
we
contend
that
if
they
wish
that
anytime
under
the
south
carolina
supreme
court's
decision
to
bring
a
new
action
contending
a
change
of
circumstances,
they
could
do
so
and
the
south
carolina
court
or
the
court
that
would
have
jurisdiction
of
the
parties
under
the
rule
that
is
prevalent
or
the
same
in
virginia
and
in
south
carolina,
and
in
north
carolina,
they
could
bring
that
action.
but
the
plaintiff
would
have
the
burden
to
show
it.
now,
we
say
not
--
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
the
children
have
been
with
their
mother
since
first
christmas
of
1959.
that's
called
--
it
was
immediately
after
january
the
1st,
1960,
but
following
upon
that,
they
were
with
the
father
during
the
summer
of
1960
and
the
father
has
had
the
custody
of
these
children
under
the
joint
custody
order
of
the
court
of
common
pleas
of
greenville
county
and
he
has
had
the
children
during
the
holidays
and
summer
vacation
period.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
no
sir.
the
father
lived
in
sanford,
north
carolina
which
was
the
marital
domicile
and
the
domicile
of
the
children.
mr.
wesley
m.
walker
my
time
is
up,
thank
you,
sir.
