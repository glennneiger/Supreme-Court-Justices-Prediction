justice

ever
since?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
living
with
their
mother
ever
since?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
saying,
from
my
understanding
--
are
you
saying
there
that
south
carolina
would
have
tried
this
case
now
from
your
understanding
that
we've
decided
that
they
can't
offer
any
evidence
behind
the
decree
that
prevent
them
in
virginia?
are
you
agreeing
to
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
up
to
date,
whenever
the
date
is.
justice
hugo
l.

then
or
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
up
to
now.
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
--
as
i
say
if
i
understood
the
question,
correctly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
did
that
court
hold?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
the
change
of
circumstances
with
regards
to
the
defendant
and
the
plaintiff.
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
this,
sir.
as
understand
that
you
are
in
full
faith
and
credit,
you
are
saying
as
the
court
said
in
the
next
to
the
last
page
of
its
opinion,
it
was
bound
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
to
give
full
credit
to
this
judgment.
suppose
that
he
go
back
now
and
it's
shown
that
the
children
had
been
living
with
their
parents
for
three
years,
this
parent,
is
it
your
contention
that
that's
settled?
and
if
they
couldn't
show
that
by
reason
of
what's
happened
during
these
three
years
while
the
case
was
pending,
the
best
interest
of
the
child
and
not
the
parents,
the
best
interest
of
the
child
wouldn't
be
served
by
keeping
it
with
the
parents,
is
that
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
i
was
getting
at
was
--
meeting
a
practical
situation,
how
long
have
these
parents
--
children
with
this
mother?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
now
lives
in
greenville?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
the
thing
has
always
bothered
me
about
this
full
faith
and
credit
with
reference
to
my
mind
is
that
--
take
a
situation
where
the
child
has
been
--
litigation
goes
on
for
two
to
three
years.
then
you
say
that
you
can
take
them
away
from
there
on
the
basis
that
this
prior
litigation
settled
in.
i
believe
something
to
be
desired
in
the
way
of
power
of
the
state
should
have
changed
circumstances
if
you
date
res
judicata
absolute
bar
at
the
time
the
judgment
runs.
