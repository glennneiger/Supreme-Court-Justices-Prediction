justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
there
really
hasn't
been
a
decree
to
the
court
below
as
to
the
effect
of
the
virginia
decree
under
virginia
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
asking
us
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
mr.
marion
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
would
you
--
assuming
that
the
virginia
--
that
the
virginia
proceeding
was
on
the
merits
and
it
was
a
judicial
determination.
let's
assume
that
there'd
been
a
hearing
in
that
evidence
in
the
determination
of
the
best
interest
of
the
children,
that
the
father
had
custody.
then
the
same
thing
happens
in
south
carolina.
would
you
--
would
you
say
then
that
the
--
and
there
was
no
--
nobody
raised
a
single
issue
about
full
faith
and
credit
in
south
carolina,
i
assume
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
virginia
--
or
what
does
--
the
south
carolina
court,
would
have
been
correct
in
saying
that
there
must
be
a
showing
here
of
change
of
circumstances
before
the
decree
now
in
existence,
entered
by
the
virginia
court,
could
be
modified?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
you
would
say
that
the
--
that
the
wife
is
not
entitled
to
relitigate
in
south
carolina,
what
she'd
already
litigated
in
virginia?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
--
you
would
--
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
virginia
court
proceeding
was
a
--
on
the
merits,
it
was
a
judicial
determination
full
faith
and
credit
is
really
beside
the
point
and
irrelevant
here,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
south
carolina
court
has
said
that
under
our
law,
we
are
going
to
give
the
virginia
proceeding.
we're
going
to
make
--
respect
it
and
consider
it
a
final
judgment
unless
--
until
there
are
change
of
circumstances
or
change
of
condition
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
and
there
are
none
here
under
our
law.
they
didn't
have
to
get
to
full
faith
and
credit.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
could
make
--
if
they
make
their
determination
aside
from
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
that
under
south
carolina
law,
we
are
going
to
give
that
virginia
decree,
a
final
effect,
then
there
wouldn't
be
anything
to
talk
about
up
here,
would
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
we
can't
--
we
can't
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
(voice

south
carolina
court
as
to
whether
under
their
law,
there
was
a
change
of
circumstance.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
even
--
i
think
they
recognize
that
even
if
full
faith
and
credit
were
applicable,
it
nevertheless,
it
does
not
present
a
stay
from
changing
a
custody
decree
based
upon
change
of
circumstances,
so
that
it
was
essential
for
them
to
get
to
that
issue
and
reach
the
holding
that
they
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

finding
of
the
court
--
south
carolina
supreme
court,
is
that
the
one
--
206,
is
that
the
one
you're
referring
to?
