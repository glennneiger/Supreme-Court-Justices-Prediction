mr.
david
l.
rose
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
a
narrow
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
but
a
question
which
is
fundamental
to
the
process
of
resolving
disputes
under
government
contracts.
in
this
case,
the
court
of
claims
has
reversed
administrative
findings
of
fact
as
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence
on
the
basis
of
evidence,
which
had
never
been
presented
to
the
administrative
decision
maker.
the
administrative
findings
were
made
pursuant
to
the
standard
disputes
clause
of
government
contracts,
which
in
effect
charges
certain
government
officials
with
resolving
factual
disputes
arising
under
the
contract
and
it
makes
their
decisions
final.
the
wunderlich
act,
which
is
before
us
here
today,
provides
for
judicial
review
of
such
decisions
for
arbitrariness
fraud
or
lack
of
substantial
evidence.
and
the
question
presented
therefore
is
whether,
as
the
court
of
claims
has
held,
a
court
reviewing
such
findings
is
free
to
upset
them
as
not
being
supported
by
substantial
evidence
or
as
being
arbitrary
on
the
basis
of
evidence,
which
has
never
been
presented
to
the
administrative
decision
maker.
it
is
of
course
our
position
that
judicial
review
under
the
wunderlich
act,
like
judicial
review
in
most
other
instances,
is
to
be
made
only
on
the
administrative
record
and
not
on
the
basis
of
evidence,
which
is
never
been
before
the
administrative
decision
maker.
i'll
note
that
our
position
is
supported
by
the
decision
of
every
district
court
and
court
of
appeals,
which
has
passed
on
this
issue.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
would
say
that
at
least
one
has
clearly.
i
think
that
two
others
have
clearly
indicated
that
this
is
the
view
they
take.
in
order
to
set
the
issue
in
its
context,
i
should
like
briefly
to
recall
to
the
court
the
facts
which
give
rise
to
it.
in
july
1946,
the
respondent
was
a
successful
bidder
on
a
contract
to
build
an
earthen
dam
in
upper
new
york
state.
included
in
the
contract
was
the
construction
of
certain
outlet
works,
including
a
tunnel,
which
was
to
be
710
feet
in
length
and
which
was
to
be
aligned
with
concrete.
the
tunnel
was
designed
to
carry
water
from
in
front
of
the
dam
to
the
stream
below
it,
it
was
not
designed
for
the
people
to
go
through.
the
tunnel
was
to
be
constructed
through
rock
and
was
to
be
free
standing
that
is,
it
was
designed
on
the
premise
that
the
rock
was
sufficiently
stable
to
allow
the
tunnel
to
stand
without
any
permanent
ceiling
supports,
except
for
a
short
period
--
short
piece
at
either
end
of
50
feet
in
length.
by
the
end
of
march
1947,
a
subcontractor
had
dug
the
tunnel
through
or,
hold
the
tunnel
out
to
use
the
engineering
terminology,
without
ceiling
supports
of
any
kind
either
permanent
or
temporary.
before
placing
the
concrete
however,
a
factual
dispute
arose.
the
respondent
took
the
position
that
the
underground
rock
was
materially
different
from
that
which
have
been
shown
in
this
specifications
in
borings
and
that
permanent
steel
supports
were
necessary
in
order
to
hold
the
tunnel
up
and
that
they
should
be
installed
at
the
government’s
expense
before
placing
the
concrete.
it
sought
the
payment
under
article
4
of
the
contract,
which
has
to
do
with
conditions
materially
different
from
those
shown
in
the
specifications
are
normally
to
be
expected.
the
contracting
officer
denied
the
respondent's
claim
on
the
ground
that
the
rock
was
in
fact
sufficiently
stable
for
a
free
standing
tunnel,
and
that
it
was
of
a
kind
which
was
to
be
expected
from
the
borings
in
specifications.
pursuant
to
the
disputes
clause,
respondent
appealed
to
the
corps
of
engineers
claims
and
appeals
board,
which
held
a
full
trial
type
hearing
where
each
side
introduced
all
the
evidence
it
desired
to
introduce.
respondent
produced
nine
witnesses
there,
but
introduced
the
testimony
of
only
four,
including
engineers
and
a
geologist.
the
government
introduced
the
testimony
of
three
witness,
all
of
whom
had
personal
knowledge
of
the
fact
and
whose
testimony
fully
supported
the
government's
position.
i
think
the
geologist's
testimony
on
each
side
is
the
critical
testimony
before
the
board.
the
record
before
the
board
was
in
our
view,
a
classic
instance
of
sharply
conflicting
testimony
by
lay
and
expert
witnesses
who
had
personal
knowledge
of
the
facts
and
where
the
finder
of
fact
could
reasonably
find
either
way.
the
board
found
that
the
underground
rock
was
of
a
kind
to
be
expected
and
that
permanent
tunnel
protection
was
unnecessary,
thereby
sustaining
the
contracting
officer's
decision.
the
respondent
filed
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
approximately
six
years
later.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
it
is
six
years,
your
honor.
i
think
they
just
came
under
the
limit.
i
should
add
that
the
hearing
before
the
board
was
conducted,
three
years
prior
to
the
wunderlich
act
and
that
the
suit
was
filed
here
approximately
a
few
months
after
the
wunderlich
act.
the
testimony
was
heard
before
a
commissioner
of
the
court
of
claims
who
took
evidence
de
novo
over
the
strenuous
objections
of
government
counsel,
evidence
which
had
never
been
presented
to
the
board.
the
respondent
introduced
testimony
of
approximately
15
witnesses
and
approximately
six
or
seven
times
as
many
exhibits
as
it
had
in
the
administrative
hearing.
the
commissioner
made
independent
findings,
principally
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence,
which
had
not
previously
been
presented
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence,
which
was
not
before
the
board,
and
the
court
of
claims
overturned
the
board's
findings
and
awarded
judgment
to
the
respondent
of
approximately
$150,000.
it
did
not
find
that
the
board's
findings
where
arbitrary
or
unsupported
by
substantial
evidence
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
the
board,
but
it
held
that
it
was
entitled
to
receive
evidence
de
novo,
which
had
never
been
before
the
board
and
that
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence,
including
the
evidence
received
de
novo,
the
board's
decision
was
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no,
i
think
first,
your
honor,
they
read
the
statute
as
authorizing
the
reception
of
evidence
de
novo,
although
the
standard
of
review
is
substantial
evidence.
we
had
then
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
only
after
making
the
objections
and
after
its
objections
had
been
overruled.
mr.
david
l.
rose
and
there
was
no
assertion
here
of
any
waiver
of
the
government's
position.
we
then
have
the
principal
issue
here,
which
is
whether,
as
the
court
of
claims
has
held,
a
reviewing
court
may
overturn
factual
findings
on
the
basis
of
evidence
never
before
it
or
as
the
courts
of
appeals
and
district
courts
have
held,
review
is
limited
to
the
evidence,
which
was
before
the
administrative
board
that
is
to
the
administrative
record.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
i
think
that's
the
jurisdictional
grant,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
wunderlich
act
itself,
which
is
incidentally
entitled
an
act
to
provide
review
is
specifically
was
specifically
designed
with
that
in
mind,
that
is
to
provide,
to
authorize
judicial
review
in
spite
of
the
provision
of
the
standards
disputes
clause,
which
says
that
the
administrative
determination
is
to
be
final.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
that's
right
your
honor,
just
as
the
district
court
as
the
trial
court
and
has
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act
under
1346
(a)
(2).
mr.
david
l.
rose
each
jurisdictional
statute
gives
the
court
authority
to
hear
disputes,
cases
arising
under
contracts.
now
if
there
were
no
disputes
clause
in
the
contract,
then
each
court
could
proceed
to
trial
in
the
normal
course.
this
court,
in
a
line
of
decisions
going
back
to
1878,
has
upheld
disputes
clauses
such
as
this
one
in
government
contracts.
and
in
the
wunderlich
decision,
which
was
in
1951,
the
court
held
if
there
is
no
judicial
review
except
in
the
cases
of
fraud
and
bad
faith.
so
that
--
although
the
wunderlich
act
is
not
a
jurisdictional
grant,
it
does
provide
that
the
standard
disputes
clause
provision
will
not
be
read
to
limit
or
prevent
judicial
review.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no
i
think
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
the
court
has
jurisdiction
and
under
that
--
with
that
jurisdiction
your
honor,
in
the
wunderlich
case,
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
judicial
review
before
the
passage
of
the
wunderlich
act,
there
was
no
judicial
review
except
in
cases
of
fraud
or
bad
faith,
except
to
that
extent
there
is
judicial
review,
but
as
in
other
cases
of
arbitration
there
is
no
review.
so,
that
this
statute
is
putting
back
to
the
courts
both
the
district
courts
and
the
court
of
claims
the
authority
to
review
in
spite
of
the
agreement
of
the
parties
that
the
decision
was
to
be
final
and
conclusive.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no,
i
think
they
would
not,
because
the
statute
itself
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
the
statute
says,
“any
such
decision
shall
be
final
and
conclusive,
unless
the
same
is
fraudulent,
capricious,
arbitrary
or
so
grossly
erroneous
as
necessarily
to
imply
bad
faith,
or
is
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.”
so,
here
we
have
both
the
statute
and
the
contract,
which
makes
the
decision
final
except
in
these
limited
circumstances.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no,
my
argument
is
divided
into
three
parts
basically.
i'm
going
to
discuss
the
language
of
the
act,
legislative
history,
and
the
purposes
of
the
disputes
clause
and
since
this
is
a
question
of
legislative
intent,
i'd
like
to
turn
first
to
the
most
authoritative
source
of
that
intent,
namely
the
language
of
the
statute,
which
i've
just
recited
as
found
in
pages
on
two
and
three
of
our
brief.
what
we
understand
that
statute
to
mean
is
this
simply,
that
the
administrative
decision
is
to
be
final
and
conclusive,
if
it
was
honestly
made
and
if
it
was
reasonable.
i
think
the
terms
that
congress
has
used
here
are
the
subtle
and
traditional
terms
for
a
review
of
factual
findings
both
by
the
administrative
bodies
and
it's
quite
an
analogous
to
the
situation
of
the
court
in
a
jury
case.
the
term
fraudulent
is
merely
preserving
the
pre-wunderlich
situation
and
it's
not
involved
in
this
case.
the
terms
arbitrary
and
capricious
are
antonyms
of
course
for
the
term
reasonable.
similarly,
a
decision
cannot
be
so
grossly
erroneous
as
necessarily
to
imply
bad
faith,
if
it's
a
reasonable
decision,
because
if
a
reasonable
man
could
make
it,
then
there
is
no
need
or
no
possibility
indeed
of
inferring
bad
faith.
and
lastly,
the
term
supported
by
substantial
evidence
as
the
house
report,
which
reported
the
final
bill,
which
became
the
wunderlich
act
stated
quoting
this
court's
decision
in
the
consolidated
edison
company
case,
“the
term
substantial
evidence
means
such
relevant
evidence
as
a
reasonable
mind
might
accept
as
adequate
to
support
a
conclusion.”
in
other
words,
evidence
that
a
reasonable
person
could
accept.
as
we
see
it
then,
congress
in
this
traditional
and
subtle
language
has
said
that
the
administrative
resolution
of
factual
disputes
is
binding
if
it
was
honestly
made
and
if
it's
reasonable
and
the
court's
function
therefore,
as
we
understand
it,
is
limited
to
seeing
to
it
that
the
adjudicator,
the
administrative
officials
acted
honestly
and
reasonably
and
their
review
is
limited
to
that
scope.
mr.
david
l.
rose
it
is
your
honor,
but
that
is
what
the
parties
contracted
to
do
and
indeed
in
the
martinsburg
railroad
case,
we
have
the
same
situation
where
a
railroad
entered
into
a
contract
of
this
kind
with
a
private
contractor
and
named
its
chief
engineer
as
the
factual
arbiter.
and
as
i
have
indicated,
both
this
court
in
a
line
of
decisions
going
back
to
1878
has
approved
this
kind
of
a
clause
and
congress
indeed
by
the
passage
of
the
act
here
in
making
such
decisions
final
and
conclusive
has
put
its
stamp
of
approval
on
it
too.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
with
that
qualification,
yes
your
honor.
i
think
that's
--
so
the
standard
disputes
clause
in
this
form
was
before
congress
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act.
mr.
david
l.
rose
right.
mr.
david
l.
rose
precisely.
mr.
david
l.
rose
review
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
that's
right.
well,
we
think
it
means
that
it's
final
if
it's
a
reasonable
decision.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no,
that's
quite
right.
and
since
the
court's
function
is
limited
as
we
understand
it
to
determining
whether
the
board
acted
reasonably,
we
think
it's
quite
apparent
from
the
ordinary
use
of
language
that
you
can't
go
beyond
the
evidence,
which
was
before
the
board.
if
the
term
is
arbitrary,
a
decision
cannot
be
condemned
as
being
arbitrary
or
capricious
on
the
basis
of
evidence,
which
was
never
before
the
decision
maker.
and
similarly,
the
term
so
grossly
erroneous
is
necessary
to
imply
bad
faith,
which
is
a
term
found
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
prior
to
the
wunderlich
act.
this
court
in
the
ripley
case,
ripley
versus
united
states
in
220
u.s,
222
u.s
and
223
u.s
said
that
in
substance
that
you
can't
condemned
and
overturn
this
kind
of
administrative
decision,
except
on
the
basis
of
facts
known
to
the
decision
maker.
and
lastly,
the
term
substantial
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
that's
right.
mr.
david
l.
rose
board.
mr.
david
l.
rose
that's
correct.
mr.
david
l.
rose
the
prevailing
view
in
the
court
of
claims
was
that
there
was
a
review
for
arbitrary
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
i
don't
think
so
your
honor.
i
think
the
needles
case,
which
we
cite
in
the
dean
case
or
young
case,
indicate
that
the
court
of
claims
could
not
base
its
decision
on
evidence,
which
was
not
before
the
decision
maker.
at
any
rate,
this
court
in
the
ripley
case,
which
i
have
just
referred
to
made
that
quite
clear.
there
are
three
cases,
three
decisions
in
the
same
case
there,
where
this
court
sent
the
case
back
to
the
court
of
claims
to
ascertain
what
the
decision
maker
knew.
and
since
that
--
that
was
the
only
basis
in
which
the
decision
could
be
overturned,
on
the
basis
of
what
the
decision
maker
knew,
on
the
basis
of
evidence
that
was
before
him.
and
therefore,
as
we
understand
it,
the
review
was
for
reasonableness
in
factual
findings.
and
if
it
is
a
review
for
reasonableness,
the
evidence
which
was
never
before
the
decision
maker
can
have
no
bearing
on
that
review,
because
the
decision
can't
be
condemned
as
unreasonable
on
the
basis
of
material
that
was
never
before
the
decision
maker.
now
the
term
substantial
evidence
is
of
course
by
now
deeply
routed
in
our
jurisprudence
both
in
decisions
and
statutes.
and
we
think
it
is
quite
significant
that
in
every
statute
in
which
congress
has
passed
providing
for
such
review,
judicial
review
for
substantial
evidence,
it
has
met
judicial
review
upon
the
administrative
record.
we
collect
some
of
those
statutes
in
pages
24
and
25
of
our
brief.
and
indeed
in
every
statute
where
congress
has
provided
for
judicial
review
without
setting
forth
a
standard,
it
has
been
held
by
this
court
and
it
has
been
held
and
congress
has
gone
along,
that
review
was
on
the
administrative
record.
as
mr.
justice
brandeis,
said
speaking
for
unanimous
court,
a
proceeding
under
the
packers
and
stockyards
act
is
a
judicial
review,
it's
not
a
trial
de
novo,
this
is
page
26
of
our
brief.
the
validity
of
an
order
of
the
secretary
therefore
like
that
of
an
order
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
must
be
determined
upon
the
record
of
the
proceedings
before
him.
so
that
there
was
a
subtle
meaning
to
this
term
substantial
evidence
and
the
other
terms
are
arbitrary,
capricious
before
congress
passed
this
act.
mr.
david
l.
rose
absolutely
your
honor,
indeed
the
title
of
the
act
is
an
act
to
provide
review,
meaning
judicial
review.
well,
that
brings
us
then
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
the
court
of
claims
has
indeed
recognized
the
logical
weakness
in
its
position,
but
has
said
in
effect
that
this
is
what
congress
intended
and
therefore
we
have
to
go
along.
it's
our
position
that
the
legislative
history
shows
not
only
that
congress
intended
to
use
these
terms,
these
subtle
terms
in
their
traditional
and
subtle
meaning
to
provide
for
judicial
review
on
the
administrative
record,
but
also
that
congress
added
the
standard
of
substantial
evidence
specifically
to
require
each
side
to
present
it's
case
fully
and
openly
to
the
administrative
officers
or
board.
and
that
its
intent
is
only
consistent
therefore
with
a
view
that
substantial
evidence
means
substantial
evidence
before
the
decision
maker.
that
congress
used
the
terms
in
their
traditional
and
subtle
meaning,
is
clear
from
the
house
report
the
report
on
the
final
bill.
on
page
four
of
that
report
there
is
reference
to
the
terms
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
congress
notes
that
these
are
the
terms
that's
used
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
also
refers
to
the
ripley
case
to
which
i
have
just
adverted
and
where
this
court
said,
a
court
of
claims
decision
could
be
upset
only
in
the
basis
of
facts
known
to
the
decision
maker.
similarly,
the
term
substantial
evidence
congress
noted
was
included
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
where
of
course
review
for
substantial
evidence
is
on
the
administrative
record.
and
congress
referred
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
consolidated
edison
case,
which
was
a
case
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
where
again
review
is
on
the
administrative
record.
so
we
think
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
to
use
these
terms,
knew
it
was
using
terms
that
had
a
subtle
meaning
and
knew
what
that
meaning
was.
now,
the
main
purpose
of
the
wunderlich
act,
i
think
as
everyone
will
concede
was
to
provide
or
restore
judicial
review
in
situations
other
than
fraud
and
bad
faith,
but
there
is
another
purpose
and
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
that.
in
the
last
two
pages
of
our
brief,
pages
59
and
60,
we
quote
from
the
house
report
and
i'll
summarize,
it's
at
the
bottom
of
pages
59
and
60,
and
i'll
summarize
the
beginning
of
that.
it
had
come
to
the
attention
of
congress
that
some
of
the
administrative
hearings
were
not
full
hearings
in
that
the
records
were
inadequate
and
congress
sought
to
change
that
situation
and
how,
what
instrument
that
it
used
to
change
the
situations,
the
substantial
evidence
test.
if
you
look
at
the
last
line
of
page
59,
this
is
the
house
report
on
the
bill
that
was
finally
reported.
it
is
believed
that
if
the
standard
of
substantial
evidence
is
adopted
this
condition
will
be
corrected
and
the
records
of
hearing
officers
will
here
after
contain
all
the
testimony
and
evidence
upon
which
they
have
relied
in
making
their
decisions.
and
congress
went
on
to
say,
this
is
in
effect
to
require
each
party
to
present
openly
its
side
of
the
controversy
and
afford
an
opportunity
of
rebuttal.
now
congress
could
use
that
term
substantial
evidence
in
order
to
effect
this
result,
only
if
it
understood
the
term
substantial
evidence
to
mean
substantial
evidence
on
the
record,
because
if
either
side
could
withhold
evidence
from
the
board
and
then
introduce
it
in
court
to
sustain
or
upset
the
decision
there
would
not
be
this
necessity
of
introducing
it's
case
fully
before
the
board.
mr.
david
l.
rose
it
has
none
your
honor.
i
should
add
though
that
the
very
authority
cited
by
counsel
for
respondent
indicates
that
in
almost
every
instance
that's
the
article
in
--
for
practicing
lawyer,
in
almost
all
cases
the
parties
have
been
able
to
obtain
the
desired
witnesses
and
documents.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes
i
would
say
that
in
this
instance
counsel
for
petitioner,
counsel
for
respondent
excuse
me,
withdrew
a
number
of
the
exhibits
and
these
were
hard
to
find
six
years
later
or
about
eight
years
later
when
the
case
came
to
trial,
but
all
of
the
record
was
made,
a
transcript
was
taken,
it's
reproduced
verbatim
in
this
record
here.
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
upon
the
request
there
is
a
provision
for
summary
before
some
of
the
agencies
where
counsel
for
each
side
agreeing
that
this
is
what
the
testimony
was.
mr.
david
l.
rose
i
should
like
to
make
two
points
in
the
time
allowed
to
me.
the
first
is
that
i
would
agree
that
the
association
of
general
contractors
of
america
was
a
moving
force
in
the
wunderlich
act.
page
29
of
the
senate
hearings,
this
is
the
review
that
they
sought.
the
position
of
the
association
as
we
believe
that
any
decision
should
be
subject
to
judiciary
review
in
order
to
guarantee
that
such
decision
is
reasonable,
made
with
due
regards
to
the
rights
of
both
contracting
parties,
and
this
is
a
key
part,
and
supported
by
the
evidence
upon
which
the
decision
was
based,
and
that
is
what
they
sought
and
that
we
submit
as
what
they
got,
when
they
got
the
substantial
evidence
test.
mr.
gaskins
who
was
a
contractor
representative
and
one
of
the
leading
spokesman
for
the
contractors
when
asked
what
kind
of
review
it
would
be
in
court,
said
“it
will
be
an
appellate
review.”
now
the
term
appellate
review
to
me,
means
review
on
the
record
and
that
is
precisely
what
we
contend
here.
mr.
david
l.
rose
they
can
suspend
their
proceedings
your
honor,
just
as
they
do
in
the
icc
case,
the
pennsylvania
railroad
case
that
we
cite,
suspend
their
proceedings
with
an
indication
that
that
they
want
the
record
rectified
and
we
cite
--
i
see
absolutely
no
reason
why
the
same
thing
couldn't
be
done
here
at
this
court
in
pennsylvania
railroad
case
approved
that
court
of
claims
procedure
in
icc
cases.
now,
i
should
like
to
make
this
point
at
the
end.
the
purpose
of
the
disputes
clause
is
to
provide
an
expert
an
inexpensive
forum
for
the
quick
resolution
of
factual
disputes.
this
court
has
approved
the
disputes
clause
and
congress
in
the
very
passage
of
the
wunderlich
act
approved
it
subject
to
judicial
review
for
substantial
evidence.
the
taking
of
evidence
de
novo
frustrates
that
purpose
in
two
basic
ways.
it
makes
the
resolution
of
factual
disputes
both
expensive
and
time
consuming.
here
we
have
17
years
that
this
dispute
has
been
going
on
whereas
the
dispute
before
the
board
was
over
an
year-and-a-half,
and
the
tremendous
expense
of
two
trials
on
the
same
issue
of
liability
the
--
whereas
one
hearing
before
the
board,
there
were
three
hearings
in
three
separate
cities
san
francisco,
washington
and
boston
in
the
court
of
claims.
there
is
a
tremendous
expense
involved
and
a
tremendous
duplication
of
effort.
our
opposition
will
eliminate
one
whole
trial
type
hearing
and
therefore
accord
with
the
original
intent,
which
was
to
provide
an
expeditious
and
inexpensive
forum.
mr.
david
l.
rose
absolutely
if
there
was
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
i
would
say
your
honor,
where
the
contractor
has
so
clearly
established
his
case
in
the
evidence
before
the
board,
that
there
is
no
reasonable
mind
could
come
to
a
contrary
conclusion,
then
the
court
of
claims
could
enter
judgment.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
that
is
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
in
our
view,
the
congress
by
the
inclusion
of
the
substantial
evidence
test
clearly
intended
that
there
should
be
a
record
made
and
that's
what
the
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
i
think
they
should
suspend
proceedings
and
have
a
record
made.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
that
would
still
not
affect
the
case
that
we
have
here.
i
would
think
that's
a
possibility
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
rose
well,
in
the
extreme
case
where
there
is
no
record,
this
would
be
a
possibility
your
honor.
i
would
indicate
that
although
there
is
no
express
power
to
remand,
there
is
this
power
to
suspend
and
there
would
be
the
sanction
of
imposing
judgment.
mr.
david
l.
rose
absolutely
and
there
is
no
contention
here
that
the
contractor
was
denied
an
opportunity
to
present
all
the
evidence
he
wished
to
before
the
board.
the
record
is
clear
to
that
effect.
mr.
david
l.
rose
no,
i
think
that
the
procedure
followed
in
the
pennsylvania
railroad
case
could
be
followed
here
that
indeed
one
of
the
purposes
for
judicial
review
was
we
think
to
cure
the
procedural
defects
as
well
as
substantive
defects,
and
in
the
primary
jurisdiction
cases
the
ones
i'm
referring
to
the
court
of
claim
is
merely
suspend
its
proceedings
and
the
case
does
in
fact
go
back
to
the
administrative
agency
and
the
proceedings
are
held
there,
and
i
think
that
would
be
the
comparable
situation
here
with
the
sanction
to
impose
judgment
if
the
--
mr.
david
l.
rose
yes,
absolutely,
and
we
think
that
one
should
be.
it's
our
view
that
it
should
be
remand,
but
either
would
cover
the
situation
here
and
neither
is
before
the
court
here
in
our
view,
because
here
we
think
that
each
party
was
afforded
full
opportunity
to
present
its
evidence
and
there
was
ample
evidence
to
support
either
conclusion
before
the
board.
