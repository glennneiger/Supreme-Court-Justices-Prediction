justice
potter
stewart
any
statute
limitation?
justice
potter
stewart
the
government
put
in
evidence
de
novo
as
well,
did
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
a
preliminary
argument
--
difficulty
with
your
argument.
you've
used
the
word
repeatedly
reviewing
court
and
review.
i
suppose
or
you
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
if
jurisdiction
in
the
court
of
claims
wasn't
based
in
this
case
on
its
--
on
the
general
jurisdiction
statute,
which
i
think
is
28
united
states
code,
section
1491(4).
justice
potter
stewart
which
says
the
court
of
claims
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
render
judgment
upon
any
claim
against
the
united
states
founded
upon
any
express
or
implied
contract
to
the
united
states,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
don't
we
have
to
kind
of
begin,
at
least
we
have
to
kind
of
begin
with
the
general
function
and
power
of
the
court
of
claims
under
that
statute.
the
way
that
language
reads,
it's
not
a
reviewing
court,
it's
not
an
appellate
court,
it's
the
trial
court.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
--
it's
not
only
it's
not
a
jurisdictional
grant,
it's
a
withdrawal
of
jurisdiction
i
suppose
you
say
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
withdrawal
of
the
general
jurisdiction
conferred
by
28
u.s.c
1491(4).
justice
potter
stewart
another
--
a
little
difficulty
i
have
is
your
repeated
use
of
administrative
agency
finding,
the
administrative
process
and
so
on.
this
is
all,
but
here
is
a
contract
between
two
contracting
parties
and
here
is
the
so-called
administrative
finding
and
the
finding
by
one
of
the
parties
to
the
contract,
it's
a
little
different
from
a
disinterested
jury,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
both
agree,
both
you
and
your
adversary
agree
that
the
disputes
clause
doesn't
mean
what
it
says.
the
only
question
is
how
much
--
justice
potter
stewart
less
does
it
mean,
and
what
it
actually
does
--
justice
potter
stewart
yeah,
but
that
isn't
what
it
says?
justice
potter
stewart
this
so
called
administrative
agency
doesn't
have
any
subpoena
power,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
is
a
transcript
made
and
are
the
exhibits
all
preserved?
justice
potter
stewart
is
a
transcript
routinely
made
and
preserved
with
the
--?
