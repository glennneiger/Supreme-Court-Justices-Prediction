mr.
william
h.
matthews
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
government
counsel
hasn't
commented
at
all
on
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
before
the
congressional
committees
of
the
senate
and
the
house
at
the
hearings
in
connection
with
this
legislation.
we
deem
that's
very
important
to
arrive
at
a
fair
interpretation
of
the
provisions
of
this
statute.
now
the
main
force
behind
this
legislation
was
the
construction
industry
and
the
representatives
of
that
industry
were
very
wrote
up
over
the
wunderlich
decision.
they
were
joined
by
the
general
accounting
office
who
felt
that
their
statutory
authority
had
been
taken
away
from
them,
the
authority
to
adjust
and
settle
claims
by
and
against
united
states
have
been
taken
away
from
them
by
the
wunderlich
decision
and
so
they
joined
industry
in
an
effort
to
obtain
this
legislation.
now
the
only
opposition
to
the
legislation
was
the
department
of
justice.
the
industry
witnesses
have
hailed
the
wunderlich
decision
in
strongest
terms
barring
again
and
again
from
the
dissenting
opinions,
the
language
used
in
the
dissenting
opinion
in
the
wunderlich
decision.
the
plea
of
the
industry
and
all
of
this
is
on
the
record,
was
that
they
get
back
to
the
position
that
they
were
in
prior
to
the
wunderlich
decision
and
that
the
court
of
claims
be
permitted
to
exercise
the
same
jurisdiction
that
it
always
had
exercised
over
--
in
testing
the
decisions
of
these
contracting
agencies.
and
their
testimony
is
very
clear
that
they
interpreted
the
proposed
legislation
as
doing
just
that.
the
testimony
of
the
many
witnesses
to
this
effect
is
referred
to
in
our
brief.
one
of
the
leading
advocates
of
this
legislation
was
the
associated
general
contractors
and
their
plea
was
that
the
committee
draft
legislation
that
will
grant
the
courts,
“jurisdiction
to
hear
determine
and
enter
judgment
against
united
states
on
any
claims
in
which
the
courts
–
in
which
the
contractors
will
seek
review.”
now
they
act
as
a
substantial
evidence
standard,
be
applied
and
that
the
courts
be
authorized
to
render
judgment,
“on
the
evidence
presented
to
the
court.”
the
testimony
of
the
general
accounting
office
witness
with
respect
to
the
proposed
bill
was
and
i
quote
that
there
should
--
“that
they
would
be
restored
to
the
courts
and
to
the
general
accounting
office,
their
present
jurisdiction
or
their
normal
proper
jurisdiction.”
the
bill
as
finally
enacted,
adapted
the
language
proposed
by
the
general
accounting
office.
there
really
was
no
sponsor
before
the
congressional
committees
for
the
government's
present
position
that
review
be
restricted
to
the
administrative
record.
congress
was
made
fully
aware
of
these
standards
applied
by
the
court
of
claims
in
reviewing
these
contracting
agency
decisions.
they
were
informed
that
over
a
period
of
many
years
the
standards
arbitrary
and
capricious
had
been
employed
and
that
the
court
of
claims
had
also
recognized
the
substantial
evidence
rule.
government
counsel
states
here
that
pre-wunderlich
the
standard
was
limited
to
fraud
and
bad
faith.
in
that
connection
may
i
read
from
the
government's
petition
for
writ
in
this
case.
at
page
10,
they
say
there
is
no
doubt
that
congress
passed
the
wunderlich
statute
in
order
to
make
certain
that
judicial
review
of
an
administrative
decision
under
the
disputes
clause
would
also
be
available
where
the
contractor
establishes
arbitrariness
and
capriciousness.
in
this
respect,
congress
can
be
said
simply
to
have
codified
the
view
many
times
by
--
reiterated
by
this
court
prior
to
its
decision
in
united
states
v.
wunderlich.
congress
was
also,
in
this
testimony
taken
at
these
hearings,
fully
appraised
of
the
fact
that
the
court
of
claims
permitted
the
presentation
of
evidence
in
open
court
in
testing
these
administrative
decisions
of
these
contracting
agencies
and
that
they
had
done
so
over
a
period
of
many,
many
years
going
back
to
1911
in
the
ripley
decision.
and
congress
was
informed
why
it
was
so
necessary
for
the
contractors
that
the
court
of
claims
exercise
jurisdiction
in
this
manner,
that
this
disputes
clause
was
not
a
matter
of
negotiation
between
the
contractor
and
the
contracting
officer,
but
neither
had
the
authority
to
modify
it
or
change
it
in
anyway.
congress
was
told
to
through
the
mouths
of
the
witnesses
that
a
board
composed
of
employees
of
the
contracting
agency
was
no
adequate
substitute
for
an
impartial
review
by
the
court
so
that
it
will
be
just
as
impartial
as
trying
a
case
before
a
jury
composed
entirely
of
the
contractors.
congress
was
told
about
the
inadequate
hearing
procedures
afforded
by
these
contracting
agencies.
the
fact
that
the
contractor
would
go
in
and
present
their
witnesses,
they
would
be
subjected
to
cross-examination.
the
government
would
produce
no
witnesses
of
its
own
or
in
those
cases
where
the
government
did
produce
witnesses,
the
congress
was
informed
that
these
boards
relied
on
ex-party
statements,
some
of
which
were
made
by
the
very
officials
whose
decisions
where
the
subject
matter
of
the
appeal.
these
contracting
agencies
had
no
statutory
power
to
conduct
a
fair
hearing,
whether
or
not
a
hearing
was
afforded
or
whether
a
record
was
made
less
entirely
in
the
discretion
of
the
head
of
the
department.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
if
there
had
been
no
act,
the
contractors
would
still
have
had
the
right
which
they've
always
had
under
the
tucker
act
to
bring
an
original
proceeding
in
the
court
of
claims
to
test
the
decision
of
the
contracting
agency.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
in
spite
of
the
disputes
clause
for
50
years
--
50
years,
contractors
have
been
permitted
to
go
into
the
court
of
claims
and
test
the
administrative
decisions
whether
those
of
a
board
or
whether
in
the
--
going
back
50
years
ago
like
in
the
ripley
case.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
well
the
wunderlich
decision
would
have
made,
that's
the
reason
they
needed
the
legislation
as
far
as
--
mr.
william
h.
matthews
absentee
act
they
had
no
adequate
remedy
at
all.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
despite
of
all
the
defeciencies
in
the
hearing
they
had
no
adequate
remedy
in
the
courts.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
but
congress
gave
them,
but
if
you
go
to
the
report
and
the
report
itself
is
--
everything
in
the
report
is
grounded
on
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
who
appeared
before
the
congressional
committee.
now
the
very
important
--
mr.
william
h.
matthews
sir?
mr.
william
h.
matthews
the
department
of
justice
defended
the
wunderlich
decision;
that
was
it.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
that
was
the
only
--
as
far
as
the
decision
is
concerned,
but
there
was
no
testimony
indicating
a
desire
to
change
the
usual
procedures
in
the
court
of
claims
in
applying
the
standards
arbitrary
and
capricious
that
the
standards
that
have
been
implied
over
a
period
of
many,
many
years.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
that
was
the
decision
of
the
department
of
justice
in
substance.
now,
these
boards
had
no
statutory
powers,
they
hadn't
any
power
to
administer
an
oath
or
to
compel
the
attendance
of
witnesses
or
to
compel
the
attendance
of
documents.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
i
would
say
yes,
judging
from
the
actions
taken
by
the
board.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
well
i'll
give
you
an
illustration
on
that.
i'd
like
to
refer
to
page
45
of
the
petitioner's
brief,
where
petitioner
and
this
is
in
the
present
case,
he
makes
the
statement
and
i
quote,
“since
the
board
normally
adjourned
referring
to
this
board
hearing,
at
5:00
pm
the
board
limited
respondent's
presentation
in
order
to
allow
the
government
time
to
present
its
case,
citing
record
page
109.”
now
page
109
in
the
record
will
show
that
the
limitation
imposed
on
these
two
witnesses,
the
total
time
that
they
were
to
--
had
to
testify
was
one
hour.
in
the
court
of
claims
the
same
two
witnesses,
their
testimony
took
almost
a
full
day.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
but
i
would
say
that
the
counsel
for
the
respondent
didn't
object,
but
certainly
the
reason
it
seems
to
me
to
be
obvious
that
he
wouldn't
want
to
antagonize
the
chairman
of
the
board.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
well
in
this
--
before
the
court
of
claims
there
is
3,000
pages
of
testimony
and
before
the
board
i
think
there
are
100
pages
of
testimony
and
there
are
about
100
pages
of
exhibits
which
--
many
of
which
are
not
included
in
this
printed
record.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
well
i
would
say
that
there
have
many,
many
times,
there
are
many
recurrent
problems
in
connection
with
these
hearings,
because
there
is
no
power
to
subpoena
the
witnesses.
take
for
example,
and
this
is
just
one
of
many,
an
engineer,
a
resident
engineer
in
charge
of
a
project
leaves
the
government.
he
is
an
important
witness,
there
is
no
adequate
substitute
for
his
testimony
yet
he
refuses
to
testify.
the
government
can't
get
him
and
the
contractor
can't
get
him
and
there
are
many,
many
illustrations
and
that
happens
all
the
time.
and
with
respect
to
this
improvement
in
the
hearing
procedures
a
witness
who
interpreted
the
proposed
legislation
as
maintaining
the
usual
procedures
in
the
court
of
claims
testified
before
the
committee
that
with
the
addition
of
the
substantial
evidence
rule,
there
would
be
marked
improvement
in
these
hearing
procedures,
which
would
be
of
great
value
to
the
contractors.
now
that
certainly
does
--
then
the
committee
reported
--
the
committee
adopted
this
suggestion,
even
incorporated
some
of
the
language
of
the
witness
in
their
report,
but
it
seems
unlikely
that
the
committee
would
use
the
material
drawn
from
a
testimony
of
a
witness
who
interpreted
the
act
as
not
restricting
review
from
the
administrative
record
and
from
that
testimony
draw
a
conclusion
entirely
different
from
that
of
the
witness,
of
this
same
witness
who
testified
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
the
proceedings
and
commenting
on
the
substantial
evidence
rule,
made
reference
to
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
show
that
it
had
comparable
substantive
standards
with
a
body
of
law
interpreting
them.
a
like
reference
was
made
in
the
committee
report
to
these
substantive
standards.
now
it
seems
clear
that
if
the
committee
had
intended
to
restrict
review
like
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
it
would
have
at
least
made
reference
in
the
report
to
some
of
these
procedural
standards.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
i
don't
question
the
--
mr.
william
h.
matthews
i
have
no
constitutional
due
process
argument.
now
the
petitioner
counsel
for
government
refers
to
statutes
containing
specified
standards
of
review
where
review
is
restricted
to
the
administrative
record.
now
if
congress
has
intended
to
ask
the
court
of
claims
of
jurisdiction
under
the
tucker
act,
it
seems
it
would
do
exactly
what
all
of
these
statutes
do.
they
provide
procedural
safeguards
to
conduct
a
fair
and
full
hearing.
they
all
provide
for
the
making
of
a
record.
they
grant
the
--
they
all
grant
the
administrative
agencies,
the
basic
powers
to
conduct
full
and
fair
hearings,
give
them
the
subpoena,
all
the
subpoena
powers
and
the
other
powers
necessary
to
do
that.
and
such
procedural
safeguards
are
also
found
in
the
statutes
referred
to
by
the
government
counsel
without
specified
standards
of
review
where
review
is
restricted
to
the
administrative
record.
the
government
counsel
seems
to
concede
that
a
fair
trial
and
a
complete
record
is
essential
to
test
the
decisions
of
the
contracting
agencies.
they
make
that
admission
in
their
brief.
now
in
many
instances
it
is
impossible
for
several
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
to
paraphrase
the
language
of
mr.
justice
jackson
and
his
dissenting
opinion
in
the
wunderlich
decision,
one
who
acts
as
a
judge
of
his
own
department
maybe
influenced
by
his
own
loyalties
and
it
is
true
there
unconsciously
at
times
an
employee
of
department,
loyalty
to
his
department
will
influence
his
decision.
now
can
these
administrative
irregularities
be
cured
by
a
stay?
as
indicated
by
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
the
court
of
claims
has
no
power
to
remand
to
a
contracting
agency
and
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
jones,
this
court
made
clear
that
the
court
of
claims
had
no
such
power.
and
it
certainly
has
no
power
to
please
the
administrative
agencies
to
assure
that
a
full
and
fair
hearing
is
granted.
we
submit
that
the
only
fair
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
change
the
usual
procedures
in
the
court
of
claims
permitting
the
presentation
of
evidence
de
novo.
now
we
submit
that
in
the
present
case,
the
administrative
irregularities
committed
by
the
board,
but
wants
the
court
of
claims
to
render
its
decision
on
the
basis
of
evidence
presented
de
novo.
at
the
trial
of
this
action
before
the
court
of
claims,
we
established
that
the
board
considered
and
relied
on
two
documents,
the
contents
of
which
were
not
made
known
to
the
respondent
at
the
time
of
the
board
hearing.
the
principal
document
was
a
letter
from
the
residential
engineer
in
baltimore
to
the
chief
of
engineers
of
the
army,
forwarding
the
contracting
officer's
findings
and
all
the
appeal
papers
and
this
letter
contained
six
pages
of
comments
on
the
merits
of
the
case
and
recommended
that
all
of
the
claims
be
disallowed.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
it
had
no
authority
to
--
that
was
made
clear
in
the
case
of
the
--
in
the
jones
case,
that
the
court
of
claims
has
no
power
to
remand
at
all,
to
--
they
didn't
have
any
power
to
remand
in
that
case
to
the
--
mr.
william
h.
matthews
well
the
wunderlich
act
certainly
doesn't
give
them
any
part.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
that
was
before
the
wunderlich
case.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
before
the
wunderlich
yeah.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
yes.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
no
it
doesn't.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
well
as
far
as
the
contractors
are
concerned,
a
great
deals
was
accomplish
by
the
act
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
as
far
as
--
mr.
william
h.
matthews
as
far
as
the
determination
by
the
board
it
had
no
effect,
but
it
did
--
it
took
--
the
act
took
away
this
absolute
power
that
invested
in
this
board
which
was
just
composed
of
employees
of
the
other
party
to
the
contract.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
well
it
has
the
same
effect,
except
that
the
--
they'd
have
to
apply
the
standards
and
they'd
apply
them
in
the
way
that
they
always
applied
them
before.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
well
after
actually
the
wunderlich,
before
the
--
after
the
wunderlich
decision
the
contractor
had
no
remedy
at
all
practically
in
the
court
of
claims,
because
it
had
to
prove
not
only
fraud,
but
conscious
fraud.
i
mean
fraud
of
conscious
wrong
doing.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
well,
and
again
i
read
a
portion
of
the
government's
petition
there.
it
seems
--
i
think
that
prior
to
the
wunderlich
decision,
the
standards
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
were
employed
which
gave
the
contractor
more
of
a
remedy
than
just
a
strict
standard
of
fraud.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
well
that
was
held
in
the
cases
--
in
kleeberg
case
and
other
cases,
the
gleason
case
and
other
case
decided
by
the
government
in
their
petition.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
i
think
that's
correct
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
black
but
the
congress
wasn't
changed
--
showed
no
intent
whatsoever
to
change
the
usual
procedures
and
they
were
apprised
of
these
procedures.
and
they
felt
that
the
contract
--
mr.
william
h.
matthews
well
they
knew
that
the
nature
of
the
remedy
afforded
in
the
court
of
claims
and
they
extended
the
--
they
broadened
the
standard
from
fraud
to
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
not
supported
--
mr.
william
h.
matthews
they
reversed
the
court
of
claims
in
the
mormon
case.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
i
would
call
the
--
mr.
william
h.
matthews
i
don't
go
quite
that
far
mr.
justice
black.
i
say
it's
admissible
in
evidence.
it's
admissible
in
evidence
and
it
carries
with
it
a
very
strong
presumption
and
i
just
read
in
answer
to
your
question
what
the
court
of
claim
said
in
the
needles
case
which
was
before
this
wunderlich
act
and
this
the
test
they
applied,
this
is
on
page
11
of
our
brief.
“if
this
court
is
satisfied
that
no
reasonable
man
could
have
determined
the
dispute
upon
all
the
relevant
facts
and
data
as
the
administrative
officer
did,
then
the
court
is
justified
in
inferring
as
a
fact
that
the
decision
was
not
made
impartially
or
in
good
faith.”
in
other
words
this
standard,
this
was
decided
before
the
wunderlich,
i
mean
before
wunderlich
act.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
it's
101
court
of
claims,
that
must
have
been
several
years
before
wouldn't
you
say.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
that
i
think
was
after
mormon.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
and
i
think
this
was
before
mormon.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
i
think
the
court
of
claims
has
more
rigidly
enforced
these
standards
in
the
last
--
since
the
wunderlich
act
or
since
the
wunderlich
decision.
and
then,
i
refer
on
page
10
to
the
--
i
mean
i
just
mention
one
thing.
i
want
to
take
exception
and
strong
exception
to
the
request
here
by
government
counsel
for
this
court
to
pass
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
before
the
board
and
it's
my
understanding
that,
that
has
been
their
request.
they're
asking
this
court
to
do
so
and
i
refer
in
that
connection
to
footnote
20
--
footnote
1
of
page
20
of
the
government's
brief,
where
they
say
there
is
no
issue
before
this
court
as
to
the
vein
of
the
facts,
before
the
--
and
that
the
government's
petition
solely
on
the
important
legal
question
whether
the
court
of
claims
was
restricted
to
the
administrative
record.
that
footnote
completely
misled
us
and
we
therefore
thought
we
shouldn't
burden
this
court
with
this
wrong
statement
of
facts
about
--
the
statement
of
facts
of
what
transpired
at
the
board
hearing.
so
there
is
a
record
here,
substantial
record
and
it's
unlike
any
case
that's
i'm
familiar
with
where
the
court
has
passed
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
below.
but
as
this
court
feels
that
it's
before
the
court
why
we
trusted
we
will
be
permitted
to
file
a
statement
of
facts
before
the
board.
i
don't
feel
--
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
government
has
made
it
clear
in
their
brief
that
they
were
going
to
request
this
court
to
pass
on
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
i
have
referred
to
it.
i'm
very
familiar
with
it
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
that
was
one
of
the
points
that
the
court
raised
in
it's
opinion,
and
i
think
there
is
a
lot
substance
to
that.
now
take
for
example
our
own
case,
assuming
that
the
board
had
given
us
a
decision
in
our
favor,
we
had
an
issue
that
the
boards
have
no
authority
whatsoever
to
determine
liability
for
unliquidated
damages,
so
that
in
our
case,
we
were
seeking
damages
for
delay.
the
delay
was
an
issue
before
the
board.
if
the
board
had
rendered
a
decision
in
our
favor,
we
would
have
had
to
bring
a
suit
in
the
court
of
claims
and
claim
for
damages
arising
out
of
the
same
identical
facts
that
our
claim
for
changed
conditions
and
adjustments
in
the
contract,
which
were
all
within
the
scope
of
the
contract,
that
the
board
has
authority
to
determine,
so
we
get
x
dollars
before
the
board.
and
going
to
the
court
of
claims,
we
have
two
suites
--
a
separate
suite.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
and
furthermore
there
is
this
point
--
as
i
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
amicus
brief
submitted
here,
the
government
has
a
right
to
counterclaim.
they
have
to
start
if
they
want
a
counterclaim.
they
have
to
start
an
original
--
i
mean
how
you
can
counterclaim
against
something
they
started
--
that
they
usually
counterclaimed
as
they
have
to
in
the
court
of
claims.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
i
say
no
attention
--
i
don't
say
no
attention
should
be
paid
to
it,
because
they
give
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
the
--
it
seems
to
me
from
the
needles
case
and
other
cases
that
the
court
of
claims
has
given
a
great
deal
of
weight
to
the
decision
of
the
board,
and
they
apply
the
same
rule
--
they
apply
the
substantial
evidence
rule
as
indicated
in
the
committee
report.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
may
i
illustrate
it
this
way
just
by
giving
one
answer.
in
the
15
years
prior,
this
in
the
record
of
the
hearings,
in
the
15
years
prior
to
the
wunderlich
decision,
there
are
only
48
cases
out
of
thousands
and
hundred
--
apparently,
thousands
and
thousands
that
went
to
the
court
of
claims
under
the
disputes
clause
and
of
those
48
cases,
only
16
where
the
board
decisions
were
reversed.
they
only
had
about
three
a
year,
but
it's
vital.
the
important
part
of
it
is
the
contracting
officer
and
even
back
at
that
level,
this
is
all
under
testimony,
knows
that
his
decision
isn't
going
to
be
final
as
soon
as
it
reaches
a
level
of
the
head
of
department
that
sometime
a
court
can
look
at
it
and
it
makes
a
fair
deal
between
the
government
and
the
contractor.
mr.
william
h.
matthews
yes
mr.
justice
black.
