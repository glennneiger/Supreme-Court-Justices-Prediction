they
will
lose
their
position
if
they
didn't
know

justice
hugo
l.
black
they
did
say
they
were
opposed
to
having
their
money
used
for
political
purposes,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
there
such
a
stipulation
in
reference
to
the
finding
number
two
of
the
jury?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
an
independent
union
used
dues
and
funds
which
they
collect
from
railroad
employees
influenced
vote
in
elections
to
public
officers,
the
answer,
“yes.”
you
challenge
that
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
what
about
number
four?
it
says
that
the
defendant
unions
used
dues
and
fees
that
they
collect
from
railroad
employees
to
make
contributions
to
the
campaigns
of
candidates
for
election
to
public
office.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
was
that
challenge
that
(inaudible)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
after
he
did
submit
it,
did
you
move
to
set
it
aside?
justice
hugo
l.
black
on
the
ground
that
was
not
supported
by
evidence?
justice

page

justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
used
dues
and
fees
as
such?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
you
did
not
present
as
one
of
the
questions
presented
that
you
--
the
question
of
whether
the
findings
were
supported
by
evidence?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
have
they
paid
any
dues
and
fees?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they've
been
going
to
keep
it
from
--
keep
you
from
collecting
them
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
reason.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
the
reason
there
is
but
that
doesn't
--
that
doesn't
answer
the
problem,
does
it?
they
enjoined
you
to
keep
you
from
collecting
them
on
the
ground
that
they
didn't
want
them
used
for
political
purposes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
they
do
not
have
standing
to
raise
that
that
way?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
they
--
they
come
in
and
say
we
don't
want
to
pay
it
because
it's
illegal
and
we
don't
want
to
pay
it
and
the
court
enjoins.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
part
that
you
are
asking
us
to
overrule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
this
--
according
to
this
as
far
as
specific
cause
they
don't
want
their
money
used
for
political
purposes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
say
that
they
had
to.
i
--
the
idea
that
i
was
--
i'm
sorry
of
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
i
indicated
there's
a
difference
between
making
a
man
--
freeing
a
man
from
having
his
money
extracted
from
him
to
support
one
candidate
and
extracted
from
him
to
support
a
group
of
candidates
in
political
causes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
wouldn't
be
one
of
the
reasons
that
for
a
particular
candidate
or
particular
cause.
justice
hugo
l.
black
my
thought
--
my
(inaudible)
--
my
objection
was
on
the
ground
that
the
union
didn't
have
a
right
have
the
--
half
of
the
law
to
force
people
to
pay
dues
to
it
and
it's
going
to
be
used
for
political
purposes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
what
they
object.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
didn't
mean
by
that,
that
they
had
to
go
and
look
at
each
particular
candidate
to
see
whether
that
was
the
particular
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would
put
a
burden,
i
never
would
have
thought
of
putting
on
you.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
they
did
by
enjoining
them,
didn't
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
said
the
objective,
their
money
being
used
for
political
purposes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
meant
as
i
gather
this,
they
say
they
have
notified
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
notified
them
by
an
injunction
and
got
an
injunction
to
keep
them
from
still
using
their
money
for
that
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
why
you
don't
argue
it
on
the
merits.
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
difference
--
there's
a
difference,
a
vital
difference
between
those
who
think
they
have
a
right
to
spend
their
money
for
political
purposes
by
forcing
it
from
them
and
those
who
think
if
they
have
all
the
right
in
the
world
if
they've
take
up
contribution,
that's
your
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean,
--
maybe
the
court
did
hold
that,
i
didn't
so
read
his
opinion.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
just
said
that
you
couldn't
notify
him
by
--
and
then
file
a
lawsuit,
enjoin
it
and
if
that
would
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
keep
it
from
doing
anything.
justice
hugo
l.
black
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
would
you
say
if
the
federal
government
took
their
money
to
support
the
republican
party,
your
tax
money,
how
do
you
feel
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
maybe
--
maybe
i'll
better
put
in
the
democrat.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that‘s
right,
the
presidential
campaigns
but
that's
quite
human
and
that's
what
--
the
federal
government
doing
something
in
connection
with
regulating
election.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
argument
is
that
a
man
who
wants
a
job,
the
only
way
he
can
get
it
by
--
a
reasonable
closed
shop
is
to
join
the
union
or
pay
dues.
they
--
the
union
then
as
to
the
federal
governments
say,
you
have
to
do
that
and
take
his
money
and
spend
it
for
political
purposes
when
he
is
supposed
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
but
they
give
you
--
they
fix
the
power
that
way
so
that
when
you
come
--
turns
out
and
spend
it
he
has
to
if
he
gets
his
job.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes,
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
no,
it
doesn't
have
them
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
you're
--
suppose
you're
going
to
the
court
and
say
we've
decided
that
we're
not
going
to
try
to
force
people
to
pay
dues
in
the
long
run
which
will
be
used
for
collect
--
for
supporting
candidates
or
political
causes,
would
this
injunction
still
work
against
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
you
asked
him
to
change
it
on
that
basis?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
didn't
want
that?
you
have
--
you‘re
not
ready
to
say
that
you
will
not
use
money
collected
from
them,
force
them
to
pay
it
and
then
use
it
for
political
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
think
both
of
us
could
agree
that
when
you
spend
money
to
support
candidates,
political
purposes
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
or
parties?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that's
not
--
that
--
i
doubt
if
you've
had
any
trouble
with
the
court
on
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
your
main
trouble
is,
isn't
it
--
why
not
face
it,
that
your
main
trouble
is
that
you
think
if
we
were
wrong
in
holding
that
the
union
which
has
a
close
shop
is
not
free
to
force
its
people
to
pay
dues
to
use
for
political
purposes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
ordinary
everyday
political
purposes
like
supporting
parties
or
candidates.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
suppose
that
this
one
man
--
this
man
who
said,
i
will
vote
this
way
on
this
one
issue.
he's
running
for
an
office,
there's
many
other
things,
he
shouldn't
have
--
doesn't
express
himself
on
that,
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
the
man
might
be
against
--
i've
had
that
extreme
that
of
myself
and
realize
it,
a
man
might
be
--
for
a
man's
expression
of
views
on
labor
one
way
or
the
other
and
yet
be
against
him
strongly.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
always
have
and
i
do
when
i
was
engaged
in
political
--
in
a
campaign
for
office,
i
was
engaged
in
what
most
people
thought
about
as
a
political
campaign.
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
are
related
to
collective
bargaining,
are
you
saying
that
because
political
matters'
legislations
are
related
to
political
--
collective
bargaining,
are
you
agreeing
that
that
couldn't
be
political?
justice
hugo
l.
black
[inaudible]
political
part,
we've
had
in
this
country
from
the
beginning
have
been
over
that
issue.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
--
suppose
this
law
was
one
which
provided
that
members
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
couldn't
get
a
job
unless
he
paid
dues
to
the
courts
of
chamber
of
commerce
dues,
there's
a
lot
of
members
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
[inaudible].
what
would
you
say
about
that
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
it
--
does
injunction
run
against
the
payment
of
dues
by
anyone
except
this
individual
people
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
who
had
expressed
the
opposition
to
having
their
money
used
for
this
purpose.
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
many
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
doesn't
run
against
all.
it's
not
a
blanket
running
against
all.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
even
--
and
even
as
to
them,
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
provided
that
if
the
court
–
if
the
union
developed
and
shows
the
court
how
much
they're
spending
for
political
purposes,
they
let
them
pay
the
rest?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they're
not
getting
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
are
not
getting
any
protection
that
they
would
get
from
having
their
money
used
for
political
purposes
they're
against
either,
are
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
only
way
they
could
get
it
is
the
way
the
court
did
it,
isn't
it?
