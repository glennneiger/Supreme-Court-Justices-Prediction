mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
--
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
first
like
to
summarize
briefly,
if
i
may,
just
what
it
is
that
the
record
in
this
case
establishes.
it's
clear
first
that
these
plaintiff
employees
have
been
notified
by
the
defendant
unions
and
by
their
employer,
the
railway
company
that
they
will
be
discharged
from
their
jobs
of
long
standing
unless
they
pay
money
to
the
defendant
unions.
it's
further
established
that
this
money
will,
in
part,
be
used
for
political
purposes
unrelated
to
collective
bargaining.
the
plaintiff
employees
have
gone
upon
the
witness
stand
and
have
stated
that
they
are
deeply
opposed
to
money
being
taken
away
from
them
by
compulsion
against
their
will
and
used
for
political
purposes
as
to
which
they
have
no
opportunity
of
choice
or
decision.
now
this,
we
submit
to
this
court,
is
a
double
wrong
of
major
import,
the
taking
of
money
from
people
against
their
will
as
a
condition
of
working
and
the
using
of
that
money
to
put
men
into
the
offices
of
government.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
must
admit,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
that
there
is
of
course
often
difficult
question
as
to
what
is
political
in
nature.
however,
this
court
in
the
street
case
used
the
phrase
political
purposes
throughout
and
certainly
to
contribute
money
directly
to
the
campaign
of
a
candidate
to
get
him
elected
to
office
is
a
political
purpose
and
it
is
established
in
this
case
that
that
is
what
is
done
with
this
money.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
if
one
candidate
is
[inaudible]
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
and
one
candidate
espoused
it
and
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
my
position,
sir,
would
be
that
if
the
unions
took
money
involuntarily
from
the
employees
and
said,
“we
are
going
to
put
your
money
on
this
candidate,
not
that
candidate.”
and
the
employee
has
no
opportunity
to
dis
--
to
express
or
decide
which
candidate
he
wants
it
on
and
the
union
officials
put
it
on
one,
that
is
an
expenditure
of
political
purposes
condemned
by
the
street
decision.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
not
in
electing
a
senator
or
a
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
--
or
congressman.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
this
would
be
a
closer
question,
i
think,
your
honor.
a
closer
question
and
might
have
to
be
as
mr.
justice
frankfurter
once
expressed
it,
decided
by
litigated
elucidation.
but
at
any
rate
sir,
there
are
unquestionably
in
this
case
expenditures
undeniably
political,
undeniably
so.
the
jury
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that's
true,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
indeed,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
indeed,
sir,
but
the
point
is
that
the
jury
found
and
it
is
established
here
that
that
money
was
used
to
elect
certain
candidates
to
influence
elect
--
influence
elections
to
public
office
and
also
to
effect
certain
legislation
and
defeat
other
legislation
and
at
least
some
of
that
is
political
purposes.
that
i
think
it
cannot
be
denied.
now
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that
certainly
the
general
idea,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes,
sir.
now,
i
was
saying
that
to
take
the
money
by
compulsion,
to
use
it
for
such
purposes,
is
a
major
erosion
both
of
individual
liberty
and
a
free
government,
and
it
is
therefore
indeed
an
import
of
area.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
recognize
that
i
must
come
clearly
to
that
and
i
will
in
detail,
your
honor,
but
at
this
moment
may
i
simply
say
there
is
indeed
language
in
street
that
looks
in
the
direction
of
refusing
such
injunction
as
we
have
here.
there
is
other
language
in
street
that
looks
in
favor
of
what
we
have
here
and
most
important
of
all,
your
honor,
each
and
every
defect
that
you
pointed
to
for
reversing
the
street
judgment
is
corrected
in
this
judgment,
each
as
i
will
try
to
show.
now,
the
jury
in
this
case
and
has
already
been
noted,
this
case
unlike
street,
was
not
litigated
upon
stipulations
of
evidence
but
upon
the
presentation
of
evidence
and
testimonies
subject
to
examination
and
cross
examination
in
the
ordinary
manner.
and
the
issues
therefore
were
decided
not
by
the
court
but
by
a
representative
jury
upon
issues
submitted
to
them
by
ordinary
procedure.
i've
mentioned
that
merely
in
passing.
the
evidence
consisted
of
both
testimony
and
the
exhibits.
the
exhibits
for
example,
your
honors,
included
many
pages
setting
forth
by
date,
by
name,
by
amounts,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
contributed
by
agencies
of
the
unions
to
political
candidates.
and
it
includes
for
instance
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
by
these
petitioners
directly
to
the
candidates,
the
evidence
does
not
so
show
rather
it
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
for
publications,
indeed
sir
for
candidates
through
other
agencies
and
that's
what
i
was
about
to
call
your
attention
to
in
response
to
your
question.
through
these
unions,
put
money
into
the
afl-cio
which
in
turn
put
money
into
cope,
the
committee
for
political
education
so
called.
these
unions
also
put
money
into
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
all
through
dues
i'm
talking
about,
your
honor,
compulsory
dues,
nothing
else.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
am
sir,
so
far
as
afl-cio
is
concerned
which
afl-cio
in
part
took
and
gave
to
cope
which
cope
in
turn
took
and
gave
to
political
candidates.
and
also
to
rlpl
through
rlea
which
are
railway
labor
organizations,
railway
labor
executive's
association,
railway
labor's
political
league,
likewise
made
these
contributions
these
exhibits
here
in
the
back
of
my
brief,
lists
these
expenditures
by
rlpl.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
they
were
except
that
my
adversaries
still
contend,
as
your
honors
note,
not
formally
because
they
are
too
late
to
contend
it
formally.
it's
settled
by
a
jury
verdict
and
by
lower
court
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes,
sir,
pardon?
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that's
true,
sir,
but
the
jury
filed
against
him
on
that.
he's
at
war
with
the
record.
yes,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
other
admits
he
did
pay
money
to
print
its
publications
for
political
purposes.
i
mean,
direct
out
of
his
treasury,
direct.
but
the
candidates
for
political
office
got
it,
so
the
jury
found
through
these
other
agencies
and
believe
me
it
was
the
most
difficult
matter
to
trace.
and
--
but
all
that
is
resolved
by
the
trial,
if
the
court
please,
he
argued
to
the
judge
before
it
went
to
the
jury
that
the
evidence
wouldn't
sustain
such
a
finding.
after
the
jury
--
he
argued
to
the
jury
they
shouldn't
find
it
after
the
jury
verdict
he
contented
it
should
be
set
aside.
he
argued
then
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
that
the
evidence
didn't
sustain
it.
all
those
courts
went
against
him
on
that
subject.
all
those
tribunals
went
against
him
and
that's
settled.
he
cannot
herein
this
court,
i
take
it,
argued
that
the
evidence
doesn't
sustain
the
verdict.
rather
we've
got
two
questions
before
us
now
as
i
understand.
his
first
point
is
that
our
cause
of
action
is
defeated
any
how,
no
matter
the
finding,
defeated
because
we
have
insufficiently
advised
the
unions
as
to
what
causes
our
candidates
they
espoused
and
we
opposed.
now,
the
first
answer
to
that,
your
honors
is
that
in
street,
the
plaintiffs
were
found
to
have
a
valid
cause
of
action
and
they
made
known
their
opposition
in
no
different
sense
than
what
these
plaintiffs
here
have.
furthermore,
if
the
court
please
as
mr.
justice
stewart
mentioned,
how
can
these
plaintiffs,
how
could
they
have
made
known
their
opposition
any
more
specifically
because
the
record
is
replete
that
these
unions
don't
even
notify
their
own
local
officials
as
to
who
they
support
and
what
causes
they
support
and
these
local
officials
testified.
again
and
again,
i
don't
know
what
they
do
with
the
money,
whom
they
support
and
whom
they
oppose,
how
then
could
our
class,
adversary
litigants
have
known?
and
what
must
we
do
about
notifying
them
other
than
as
this
court
said
in
a
street,
through
this
litigation
let
them
know
that
we
oppose
and
they
went
on
the
stand
and
they
said,
“we
oppose”,
we've
got
their
testimony
quoted
considerably
in
our
brief
and
i
submit
it
is
pointed,
positive,
repeated
and
rather
eloquent.
they
say,
when
we
--
when
money
of
ours
is
used
to
elect
people
to
government,
we
think
we
ought
to
say,
“do
we
want
our
money
to
go
to
this
man
or
to
that
man,”
and
not
somebody
else
make
that
decision
for
us.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no,
sir.
i
contend
that
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that
those
can
be
excluded
from
being
political
matters.
i
don't
know
that
the
--
that
the
pushing
for
a
legislation
is
not
a
political
matter.
the
jury
found
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir,
no
sir.
i
say
that
i
don't
try
to
define
what
all
is
political
matter.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
do
now
so
contend.
yes,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
do
not
--
to
seek
to
pass
the
law
on
that
it
seems
to
me
would
not
--
would
be
political
matters.
now
i
can
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
do
not
know
that
that
could
be
said
to
be
unrelated
to
collective
bargaining.
the
jury
found,
your
honor,
not
about
this
and
that
hypothetical
case,
they
said
its
been
shown
in
this
case
to
us
that
this
unions
take
this
money
and
they
do
seek
legislation
which
is
unrelated
to
collective
bargaining
and
this
court
said
the
same
in
street.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
do
not
say
that,
sir
necessarily
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
say
that
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
did
not,
sir.
that
particular
legislation
was
not
up
in
this
case.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no,
sir.
they
use
it
as
an
argument
just
as
your
honor
is
now
suggesting.
the
jury
said
in
effect
their
verdict
dismissed
certainly
it
is,
whatever
may
be
cases
of
particular
pieces
of
legislation
whether
they
are
political
or
not
at
any
rate
in
this
case
there
has
been
shown
matters
that
are
political,
that
money
is
being
used
for
and
these
matters
that
have
been
shown
to
us
are
unrelated
to
collective
bargaining
and
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no
sir,
i'm
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
do
not
say
that,
sir.
all
i
say
is
what
this
court
said
in
street.
i
merely
use
this,
as
far
as
this
court
win.
this
court
did
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
political
matters
that
are
unrelated
to
collective
bargaining,
it
cannot
take
money
from
a
man
and
spend
it
on
and
against
his
will.
now,
we're
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
think
it'd
be
political.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
now,
if
the
court
please
though
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
about
death
benefits?
death
benefit
is
a
corner
of
this
case
as
a
case
that
has
never
been
much
argued
or
discussed.
then
i
rest
nothing
upon
that
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
if
this
court
should
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that
portion
of
the
ca
--
of
the
judgment
should
be
eliminated,
i
say
that
it
can
be
eliminated
without
any
effect
upon
the
real
thrust
of
this
judgment.
now
may
i
come
quickly
to
the
judgment
because
as
mr.
justice
brennan
has
suggested,
that
is
what
i
must
meet.
i
do
say
first
about
this
business
of
notifying
the
unions.
we
did
--
what
was
done
in
street
and
they
had
a
valid
cause
of
action
and
our
notification
couldn't
go
beyond
that
as
a
factual
matter,
but
now
on
the
judgment,
what
does
this
judgment
do?
this
judgment
does
not
enjoin
the
union-shop
generally
at
all.
here
are
the
defects
in
the
judgment
that
the
court
found
in
street,
the
court
said
first
it's
defective
because
it's
a
class
judgment.
here,
there
is
no
element
of
class
judgment.
it
was
rigorously
eliminated
by
the
trial
court.
nobody
purports
to
benefit
from
this
judgment
except
people
who
are
active
litigants.
what
else
did
the
court
say
was
wrong
with
the
street
judgment?
and
i'm
quoting
now
from
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion,
page
18
of
my
brief,
i
will
read
just
a
sentence,
“restraining
the
collection
of
all
funds,
sweeps
too
broadly,”
that
on
down,
“the
prohibition
is
absolutely
against
the
collection
of
all
funds.
the
complete
shut
off
of
this
source
of
income
defeats
the
congressional
plan
and
so
forth.”
we
also
think
that
a
blanket
injunction
against
all
expenditures
of
funds
for
the
disputed
purposes
and
so
forth
would
not
be
proper.
now,
your
honors,
the
judgment
before
you
does
none
of
those
things.
this
is
not
a
judgment
restraining
the
collection
of
all
funds
from
these
plaintiffs.
it
is
not
a
prohibition
absolute
against
the
collection
of
all
funds
from
these
plaintiffs.
there
is
no
complete
shut
off
of
union
funds
from
these
plaintiffs
and
there's
no
injunction
against
expenditure
of
anything.
in
other
words,
under
this
judgment,
the
unions
are
left
free
to
collect
any
and
all
amounts
authorized
by
the
union-shop
agreement
from
voluntary
employees
and
they
are
left
free
to
collect
any
and
all
sums
related
to
collective
bargaining
from
all
employees
covered
by
the
contract
voluntary
and
dissenting
alike.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that's
true
but
the
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
surely.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that's
right.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that's
true,
sir.
that's
part
of
the
judgment.
that,
mr.
union,
if
you
will
come
and
show
what
part
is
related
to
collective
bargaining,
what
parts
you
use
for
political
purposes,
and
you
alone
know,
you
alone
have
the
facts
and
information
necessary
to
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
your
honor,
all
the
phrases
that
i
just
quoted
you
which
this
--
which
your
honor
mentioned
as
being
the
vice
of
the
street
judgment,
each
and
everyone
is
absent
in
this
judgment.
now
the
dividing
--
let
me
touch
this.
the
dividing
of
what's
related
to
collective
bargaining
and
what's
political,
the
unions
in
the
first
instance
must
do
that.
they
only
--
they
alone
know
what
they
do
with
the
money,
they
have
the
facts
and
the
information
as
to
how
they
use
it,
what
part
they
use
for
political,
what
part
they
use
for
collective
bargaining.
they
should
make
a
showing
on
that
in
the
first
instance.
as
mr.
justice
brennan
writing
in
the
case
of
united
states-campbell
said,
it
is
a
general
principle
based
in
fairness
that
the
law
does
not
place
upon
a
party
the
burden
to
proving
facts
which
are
peculiarly
within
the
knowledge
of
the
his
adversary
and
our
north
carolina
decisions
are
positively
to
the
same
effect.
and
this
dividing
of
what
is
related
to
bargaining
and
what
isn't,
were
suggested
by
this
court
in
the
united
states
against
cio
which
as
your
honors
will
remember
was
a
case
involving
union
publications
for
political
purposes.
and
there,
this
court
said,
if
minority
or
dissent
of
protection
is
intended
to
be
sufficient
for
securing
this
to
permit
the
dissenting
members
to
carry
the
burden
of
making
known
their
position
and
to
relieve
them,
relieve
them
of
any
duty
to
pay
dues
or
portions
of
them
to
be
applied
to
the
forbidden
uses.
and
the
united
states
government
industry
case
filed
a
brief
in
which
it
approved
the
same
idea.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
as
(inaudible)
--
as
defined
by
the
jury
issues
the
judgment
says.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no,
it
refers
to
the
issues
which
do
talk
in
terms
of
politics.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
think
it
must
be
determined
in
closed
cases,
your
honor.
in
difficult
cases,
it
must
be
determined
by
a
court.
i
know
no
other
way
to
determine
it
whether
that
falls
within
what
the
jury
decided
here.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that
some
of
it
was
indeed
remote
from
collective
bargaining.
they
spend
it
for
tva,
juvenile
delinquency,
hells
canyon,
disclosure
of
inmate
of
fbi
files,
enemy
alien
assets,
and
pay
television
etcetera.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
some
of
it
certainly
would,
your
honor.
but
political
purposes
and
whatever
is
to
be
comprehended
within
that
has
got
to
be
worked
out
of
course
in
each
case.
all
i
am
saying
your
honors
is,
that
money
here
was
used
for
political
purposes
undeniably
to
some
degree.
now
let
the
union
show
to
what
degree.
the
burden
should
be
on
them.
now,
just
one
more
word
if
the
court
please,
this
court,
of
course,
has
no
solicitude
or
concern
for
the
union-shop
agreement
insofar
as
it
accomplishes
as
this
court
itself
held
insofar
as
it
accomplishes
an
unlawful
purpose.
that
is
the
taking
of
money
against
an
employee's
will
and
using
it
for
political
purposes.
what
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
the
street,
as
i
understand
it,
and
the
reason
this
court
set
the
street
judgment
back
as
i
understand
it
was
this.
that
in
working
the
unlawful
operation
of
the
union-shop
agreement,
there
must
not
be
interference
with
the
union-shop
agreement
functioning
in
its
collective
bargaining
area,
in
its
proper
spheres.
there,
in
other
words,
the
court
considered
that
the
judgment
there
perpetually
enjoining,
sweeping
broadly,
denying
all
collection
of
any
nature
was
an
interference
with
the
bargaining
function
of
the
union.
and
therefore,
sent
that
--
reversed
that
judgment
and
undid
it.
and
i
am
saying
your
honor,
that
the
judgment
here
touches
and
inhibits
the
union-shop
agreement
only
in
its
unlawful
sphere,
and
not
at
all
in
its
other
operations.
now
suppo
--
our
adversaries,
your
honor,
would
apparently
have
these
plaintiff
employees
bring
suit
against
these
unions,
apparently
which
they
term,
if
the
court
please,
sometimes,
somewhere,
someday
by
protected
litigation,
any
expenditure
of
a
thousand
times
what's
involved,
you
may
restrain
the
expenditure
of
some
part
of
this
or
you
make
it
restitution,
but
the
compulsion,
you
must
now
submit
to
though
it'd
be
unlawful.
it's
held
unlawful,
nevertheless
submit
to
it.
pay
all,
now.
this,
i
submit
to
the
court,
it
should
not
be.
if
a
judgment
is
worked
out
so
that
the
unlawful
part
is
separated
from
the
lawful
part,
then
the
unlawful
part
can
and
should
be
restrained.
and
if
we
have
to
sue
every
time
your
honor,
that
would
be
perpetual
litigation.
each
case
would
resolve
nothing
except
the
amount
of
money
involved
in
that
case
only.
and
the
employee
in
order
to
maintain
the
right
of
keeping
his
money
from
going
for
political
purpose
would
have
to
sue
again
and
again
renewed,
successively,
perpetually
to
maintain
that
right.
now,
this
court
has
said
that
this
area
is
one
of
the
utmost
gravity.
the
issues
underlying
here
are
indeed
important
ones.
they
are
vital,
not
only
to
individual
liberty,
if
the
court
please,
they
are
crucial
to
the
integrity
of
the
government
itself
for
if
arrangements
are
established
by
which
collective
representatives
can
require
employees
to
pay
money
as
a
condition
of
working
and
can
then
take
that
money
and
elect
whom
they
wish
to
public
office
and
enact
laws
as
they
will,
then
we
may
be
on
the
road
toward
distinction
of
important
individual
liberty
and
free
government
as
well.
it
may
--
it
serves
not,
if
the
court
please,
to
declare
this
taking
and
using
for
political
purposes
to
be
unlawful.
it
avails
not
to
declare
it
unlawful,
if
no
meaningful,
practical
remedy
is
granted.
and
its
purpose
can
still
be
accomplished
and
it
can
be
still
accomplished
and
will
be
accomplished
unless
injunction
avails.
and
the
injunction
here,
we
do
submit
to
your
honors,
is
one
that
is
shaped
to
avoid
the
very
difficulties
that
this
court
observed
and
pointed
to
in
the
street
case.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
i
am
not,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
but
here,
your
honor,
we
are
not
restraining
the
collection
of
all
funds.
what
the
court
was
inveighing
against
was
restraining
the
collection
of
who
owe
funds
from
these
appellees.
what
the
court
was
inveighing
against
is
the
prohibition
absolute
against
the
collection
of
all
funds.
the
complete
shut
off
of
income
from
these
plaintiffs.
we
don't
shut
you.
this
judgment
doesn't
shut
off
income
from
these
plaintiffs.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no,
sir.
that's
--
i
wanted
to
advert
to
that
for
just
a
moment.
your
honor
raised
that
earlier
in
mr.
--
with
mr.
kramer.
nothing
except
monetary
payment
is
involved
here
at
all.
the
railway
labor
act,
the
statute,
the
union-shop
agreement
both
have
to
do
only
with
monetary
payment
compulsion,
no
other
kind
of
compulsion.
this
is
treated
in
a
--
on
the
other
last
of
my
brief.
they
conceded
in
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
in
their
brief,
which
i
there
refer
to
that
they
make
no
complaint
about
anything
here
and
we
make
no
complaint
about
anything
here
except
the
monetary
matters.
that's
only
compulsion
involved.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
injunction
runs
in
behalf
of
no
one
else.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
some
20
odd,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
it
is
not
--
it
is
not
for
all
employees
nor
for
a
class.
it
is
only
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
that
is
right,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
dues,
sir,
have
varied.
i
do
not
actually
know
the
amount
now
but
i
believe
it's
in
the
neighborhood
of
$5.
it
amounts
to
$8
million
per
year,
their
record
shows
in
the
case
of
one
of
this
union.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
months,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes
sir,
that's
what
(inaudible).
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
the
injunction
here,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
you;
the
injunction
here
does
not
restrain
anything
about
expenditure
or
whatever.
the
unions
are
totally
free
under
this
order
to
spend
the
money
they
get
for
any
purpose
they
may
see
fit
to
as
long
as
they
don't
run
afoul
of
some
law
like
federal
corrupt
practice
act,
not
relevant
here.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
your
honors
eliminated
the
class
aspect.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
true,
your
honor,
that's
one
of
the
defects
you
find
in
the
judgment,
class
action.
then
you
went
on
to
enumerate
the
other
defects
about
the
injunction
sweeping
too
broadly
and
(inaudible)
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
oh,
no,
sir.
i'm
not
saying
that
at
all.
i
say
that
you
first
refer
to
the
class
action
defect
and
you
send
it
back,
item
one
on
that
account.
then
you
referred
to
the
aspect
that
it
restrained
all
collections
from
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
yes,
sir.
and
you
send
it
back
for
that
reason
and
i'm
saying
this
judgment
has
none
of
those
defects.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
but
the
second
part
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
your
honor,
the
sec
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
your
honor,
the
second
paragraph
is
as
much
a
part
of
the
judgment
as
the
first
paragraph.
and
the
second
paragraph
says
that
if
a
union
would
tell
us
what
parts,
the
collective
bargaining,
we
must
pay
it
and
will
pay
it.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
they
have
put
up
bond
and
have
said
to
the
union,
“now,
tell
us
what
you
want
for
collective
bargaining
and
we'll
pay
it.”
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no,
sir
we're
not
paying
dues
but
we're
ready
to
pay.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
collect
--
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
no,
sir.
mr.
whiteford
s.
blakeney
there
is
no
other
way.
as
a
practical
matter,
there
is
no
other
way.
