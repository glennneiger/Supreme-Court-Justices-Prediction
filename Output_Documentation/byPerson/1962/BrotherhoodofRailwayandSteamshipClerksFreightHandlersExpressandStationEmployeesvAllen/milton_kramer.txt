mr.
milton
kramer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
from
a
number
of
employees
of
the
southern
railway,
suing
that
railway
and
its
non-operating
unions
to
enjoin
the
enforcement
of
a
union-shop
agreement
entered
into
by
the
railroad
and
the
unions.
the
unions
that
was
sued,
the
railroad
and
the
union-shop
agreements
are
the
identical
unions,
railroad
and
agreement
that
were
involved
in
street
--
in
international
association
of
machinists
against
the
street
which
this
court
decided
a
year
and
a
half
ago.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
afl-cio
is
asking
you
to
reconsider
street,
and
i
think
you
might
well
do
so.
we
have
not
asked
the
court
to
reconsider
street
because
it
is
not
necessary
to
do
so.
the
decision
below,
we
say
is
inconsistent
with
street,
taking
street
as
it
is.
although,
we
concur
with
the
afl-cio
that
the
court
might
well
be
considerate
and
state
that
no
cause
of
action
was
shown
in
this
case.
but
taking
street
as
it
is,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
not
shown
a
cause
of
action
under
the
street
case
and
even
if
they
had,
the
relief
that
was
given
them
is
inconsistent
with
the
relief
that
this
court
said
could
be
given
when
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
in
fact,
the
relief
given
here
is
precisely
the
relief
that
this
court
said
could
not
be
given.
mr.
milton
kramer
pardon?
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
it
is
at
least
inconsistent.
it
is
in
direct
violation.
mr.
milton
kramer
it
is
directly
contrary.
the
plaintiffs
below
chose
not
to
comply
with
the
union-shop
agreement.
instead,
they
sued
to
enjoin
its
enforcement
saying
that
they
were
not
members
of
the
union,
did
not
pay
it
any
money,
did
not
want
to
pay
it
any
money,
and
that
to
enforce
the
agreement
against
them
would
be
unlawful.
now
after
this
court
decided
the
hanson
case
that
was
a
case
that
came
from
nebraska
in
which
this
court
upheld
the
validity
of
the
union-shop
agreement
and
reversed
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
which
had
set
it
aside
on
the
ground
that
the
money
might
or
might
not
be
used
in
accordance
with
the
individual's
view.
this
court
in
this
hanson
case
said
that
wasn't
enough;
might
or
might
not
and
therefore,
reversed.
this
is
exactly
the
hanson
case.
the
case
was
tried
before
a
jury.
14
of
the
plaintiffs
testified
and
their
counsel
stated
that
of
the
others,
two
were
no
longer
employees,
one
was
in
a
position
exempt
from
the
union-shop
agreement,
and
that
the
remainder
if
they
testify,
would
testify
the
same
way
that
the
14
did.
mr.
milton
kramer
and
this
was
brought
as
a
class
action
but
the
trial
court
did
not
sustain
that
it's
a
class
action.
mr.
milton
kramer
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
now,
all
the
plaintiffs
who
testified
stated
that
they
were
not
members
of
the
union
and
were
opposed
to
union-shop.
now,
we
have
some
--
their
testimony
is
summarized
on
pages
7
to
11
of
my
brief.
all
that
they
testify
to
was
that
they
were
opposed
to
a
union-shop
and
that
they
were
opposed
to
unions
engaging
in
political
activities.
not
one
of
them,
although
asked,
could
name
a
single
political
cause
supported
by
the
unions
contrary
to
their
views.
none
of
them
testified
that
he
or
she
had
advised
the
union
of
his
views
or
indeed
had
advised
the
union
of
anything.
mr.
milton
kramer
there
was
not.
mr.
milton
kramer
these
plaintiffs
aren't
even
members
of
the
union.
now
what
the
union
does
is
not
a
secret.
they
could
ask.
the
union
has
publications
and
under
the
street
case,
this
court
held
that
the
individual
must
let
the
union
know
what
he
opposes.
in
this
case,
he
couldn't
even
name
anything
that
the
union
did
that
it
opposed
and
was
asked,
name
a
single
candidate
that
the
union
supported
to
whom
you're
opposed
and
none
of
them
could
do
it.
name
a
single
piece
of
legislation
that
the
union
supported
to
which
you
are
opposed
and
none
of
them
could
do
it
except
that
two
of
them
said,
“he
was
opposed
to
the
enactment
of
section
2
eleventh
of
the
railway
labor
act.”
mr.
milton
kramer
but
they
didn't
know
whether
the
union
supported
or
opposed
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
could
have
asked.
well
first,
fundamentally
under
the
street
case,
these
people
haven't
paid
any
money
to
the
union.
the
union
wasn't
spending
their
money
whatever
it
was
doing.
and
this
court
held
that
it's
the
spending
of
their
money
for
causes
they
opposed
which
is
unlawful,
but
they
haven't
paid
anything.
mr.
milton
kramer
pardon?
mr.
milton
kramer
well
that's
right.
but
until
they
have
paid
some
money,
they
have
no
grievance.
until
the
union
does
something
with
their
money
contrary
to
their
views
then
under
the
street
case,
they
have
no
act
--
cause
of
action.
this
court
said
specifically
that
the
union-shop
is
lawful
and
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
street
case
said,
“the
plaintiffs
therefore
remain
obliged
to
pay
the
sums
hold
for
by
the
union-shop
agreement,”
in
practically
those
words,
that
they
remain
obliged
to
pay
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
that
was
stated
that
there
was
nothing
unlawful
about
the
union-shop,
there
was
nothing
unlawful
about
collecting
the
money.
if
there
is
any
illegality
involved,
the
illegality
would
be
spending
their
money
contrary
to
their
views.
that
was
explicit
in
mr.
justice
brennan's
opinion.
well,
the
other
one
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well
i
have
to
wait
until
they
paid
it.
and
then
they
may
seek
to
have
it
spent
for
purposes
which
they
opposed.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
may
seek
to
prevent
this
expenditure
for
purposes
which
they
opposed.
now,
the
other
evidence
in
this
case
--
mr.
milton
kramer
if
they
had
an
agreement?
mr.
milton
kramer
well
that,
of
course,
would
be
illegal
that
the
union
gave
money
to
cope.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
could
say
under
the
street
case
--
i'm
just
arguing
this
under
the
street
case,
not
the
way
i
argued
the
street
case,
but
assuming
the
street
case
to
pronounce
the
law
as
it
is
today,
they
could
either
insist
--
they
could
insist
either
on
the
union
not
spending
a
portion
of
their
money
force
up
to
contribution,
or,
i
think
the
alternative
was
that
they
could
be
relieved
of
a
portion
of
the
dues
--
the
court
indicated
those
two
alternatives.
mr.
milton
kramer
none
of
these
unions
have.
i
--
mr.
milton
kramer
pardon?
mr.
milton
kramer
in
this
industry,
i
think
only
one
union
does.
the
brotherhood
of
railroad
trainmen,
i
think,
is
the
only
one
that
had
a
check
off
agreement
and
they're
not
in
this
case.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
very
common
outside
the
railroad
industry.
it
is
lawful
under
the
railway
labor
act
but
the
unions
just
haven't
been
able
to
get
it.
now
the
other
evidence
in
this
case
consists
of
a
showing
that
the
afl-cio
engages
in
certain
legislative
and
other
activities.
there
is
no
evidence
that
those
activities
of
the
afl-cio
with
which
these
unions
are
affiliated
and
to
which
it
makes
payments,
there
is
no
evidence
that
anything
the
afl-cio
does
is
contrary
to
the
views
of
any
plaintiff.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
very
extensive.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
it
just
says
substantial
amounts.
the
precise
amounts
were
not
stipulated.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
and
it
did
say
there
contrary
to
the
views
of
the
plaintiff,
there
was
no
evidence
of
anything
that
any
of
the
unions
do
or
anything
that
the
afl-cio
does
is
contrary
to
their
views.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
one
of
these
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right
and
under
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
and
under
the
street
case,
and
under
the
hanson
case,
both,
that
is
not
enough.
that
is
exactly
what
was
shown
in
the
hanson
case.
that
is
exactly
what
was
shown
in
lathrop
against
donohue.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh
no,
it
would
be
spent
for
political
purposes
which
might
or
might
now
coincide
with
their
views.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
at
all,
exactly.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
under
both
the
street
case
and
the
hanson
case.
that
was
exactly
what
the
hanson
case
was.
it
was
shown
that
they
do
spend
money
for
political
purposes,
but
all
that
was
shown
and
all
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
found
was
that
those
purposes
might
or
might
not
coincide
with
the
plaintiffs'
views.
that
was
--
this
is
exactly
the
street
v.
hanson
case
and
this
is
exactly
lathrop
against
donohue
which
was
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
no
one
has
such
a
cause
of
action
and
that's
what
this
court
held
in
the
street
case
and
in
the
hanson
case
that
they
must
show
support
of
a
specific
cause,
of
a
specific
candidate
which
they
opposed
and
off
which
they
notified
the
union
they
opposed
before
they
have
a
cause
of
action.
and
then
when
they
have
a
cause
of
action,
they
cannot
get
an
injunction
against
the
collection
of
all
money
which
is
exactly
the
relief
given
in
this
case.
this
union-shop
agreement
has
been
in
effect
with
over
10
years
now
and
these
people
haven't
paid
a
dime
under
a
preliminary
injunction
and
the
permanent
injunction.
now,
when
this
case
was
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
first,
that
court
reversed
by
a
6
to
1
vote.
but
after
the
decision
of
the
trial
court
and
what
later
became
the
street
case,
they
granted
a
rehearing
and
our
rehearing
divided
evenly
and
said
the
even
division
does
not
leave
in
effect
their
first
opinion
but
leaves
in
effect
the
trial
court's
opinion.
oh,
one
other
thing
--
one
other
--
mr.
milton
kramer
it
is
in
effect
today.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
think
so.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
mr.
justice,
i
don't
have
information
that
remains
in
effect
in
the
street
case
too,
today.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
know,
i
had
to
locate,
it's
in
effect
today.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
know.
i
asked
this
court
to
a
writ
of
mandamus
which
the
court
denied
me,
but
the
street
case
today,
the
injunctions
in
effect.
that
was
not
the
mandate
of
this
court.
and
this
injunction
is
in
effect
today,
although
the
language
is
explicit
in
the
street
opinion
that
an
injunction
against
the
collection
of
all
funds
is
not
a
proper
remedy,
--
that's
exactly
those
words.
it's
not
a
remedy
appropriate
to.
the
--
i
had
the
words
in
the
reversed
order.
now,
the
only
other
evidence
to
support
their
cause
of
action
is
that
the
--
is
at
cope,
the
community
on
political
education
of
the
afl-cio
and
railway
labors
politically
makes
contributions
to
campaigns
of
particular
candidates.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
not
a
word
to
the
contrary
is
that
every
cent
of
that
comes
from
voluntary
contributions
and
not
one
cent
comes
from
dues.
in
addition,
there
was
no
evidence
that
any
candidate
supported
by
cope
or
rlpl
was
opposed
by
any
of
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
jury
found
--
the
jury
found
that
the
unions
contribute
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
they're
not
talking
about
rlpl
and
cope.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
and
of
course,
there's
not
a
word
of
evidence
to
that
effect.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right,
there's
not
a
word
in
the
record
to
support
that
because
--
and
there
wasn't
any
point
--
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
--
certainly,
because
none
of
the
money
that
is
paid
to
the
afl
--
afl-cio
by
the
unions
goes
to
cope
for
political
expenditures,
none
of
it.
the
evidence
is
uncontradicted
that
every
cent
of
the
money
that
they
pay
comes
from
voluntary
contributions,
because
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
corrupt
practices
act
or
otherwise,
in
all
probability.
cope
and
rlpl
were
established
after
the
corrupt
practices
act
was
amended
which
prevented
unions
for
making
contributions
to
campaigns
of
candidates
for
federal
office.
mr.
milton
kramer
it
would
not
and
perhaps
the
jury
had
contributions
to
state
candidates
in
mind.
but
more
significantly,
none
of
the
plaintiffs
said
that
he
was
opposed
to
any
candidate
that
cope
or
rlpl
supported.
mr.
milton
kramer
for
political
purposes
at
all
regardless
of
what
they
were.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
there
is
not
one
word
of
evidence
and
indeed
with
respect
to
cope
and
rlpl
there
is
a
stipulation
that
none
of
the
--
none
of
those
contributions
came
from
either
of
these
unions.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
don't
recall
what's
number
two
--
mr.
milton
kramer
to
influence
votes?
no,
i
would,
i
would
not
challenge
that
they
tried
to
influence
votes.
i
do
challenge
that
they
made
contributions
to
campaigns.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
they
have
public
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
what
i'm
talking
about,
yes.
that
--
in
their
other
periodicals,
they
sometimes
announce
the
candidates
they
support
and
urge
their
members
then
the
--
mr.
milton
kramer
of
course,
that's
the
--
dues
money
is
used
for
that.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
--
mr.
justice
white,
many
people
do.
i
distinguish
between
political
and
legislative.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
i
call
it
legislative
activity.
it
can
be
called
political
but
the
unions
are
--
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
its
legislative
when
you're
before
a
legislative
body.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
for
political,
i
haven't
questioned
that
there
was
evidence
that
they
used
money
for
political
purposes.
i
challenge
that
they
contribute
money
to
campaigns.
mr.
milton
kramer
there
is
not
a
word
of
evidence
to
support
that.
but
even
if
there
were,
mr.
justice
black
--
mr.
milton
kramer
we
asked
the
judge
not
to
submit
such
a
question.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
we
moved
to
--
mr.
milton
kramer
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
supported
by
evidence?
all
the
argument
took
place
before
it
was
submitted.
before
it
was
submitted
the
court
--
we
argued
before
the
judge
that
there
was
--
there's
no
evidence
on
that.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
--
yes,
but
you
can't
find
a
word
of
evidence
in
the
records
to
support
a
contribution
to
a
campaign,
except
these
long
lists
of
contributions
by
cope
and
rlpl
--
mr.
milton
kramer
what?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
22,
item
4.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
not
--
not
in
this
court
because
it
isn't
necessary
because
for
two
reasons,
none
of
these
dues
or
--
no
dues
or
fees
came
from
any
of
these
plaintiffs.
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
plaintiffs
object
to
any
of
the
candidates
the
union
supported
if
they
supported
them,
whether
through
contributions
or
otherwise.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
have
not
paid
one
cent.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right,
we
haven't
--
mr.
milton
kramer
pardon?
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
i
say
they
don't
have
no
standing
until
certain
things
happened.
one,
that
they
have
paid
some
money.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
in
street,
this
court
specifically
--
mr.
milton
kramer
if
the
court
decided
anything
in
that
case
they
certainly
decided
that.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
no.
i'm
asking
you
to
overrule
that
there
was
a
course
of
action
at
all.
your
honor,
even
in
your
opinion,
even
in,
even
in
your
partially
dissenting
opinion,
you
repeatedly
stated
that
the
objection
must
be
to
a
specific
cause
and
he
must
notify
the
union
what
it
is
and
because
you
said
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
you
spoke
about
specific
candidates
--
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
you
certainly,
repeatedly
said
a
particular
candidate
or
a
particular
cause
and
in
addition
you
repeatedly
said
--
mr.
milton
kramer
but
i
--
it
--
mr.
milton
kramer
to
which
--
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
no.
but
you
specifically
said
to
which
they
object,
the
cause
to
which
they
object
--
mr.
milton
kramer
and
--
but
a
particular
cause
you
said
and
of
which
--
mr.
milton
kramer
and
you
also
--
mr.
milton
kramer
you
also
said
they
have
to
notify
the
union
of
the
cause
to
which
they
object.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
they
haven't
notified
them
of
any
particular
cause
of
any
particular
candidate.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
and
they
didn't
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
milton
kramer
and
all
legislative
activity.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
all.
if
they
--
they
couldn't
engage
in
any
political
or
legislative
activity
and
as
your
honors
know,
i'm
sure.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
they
haven't
given
them
any
money.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
that
it
would
have
to
be
a
particular
cause
and
also
that
they
must
notify
the
union
what
it
is.
even
in
your
opinion,
mr.
justice
black,
you
repeatedly
said,
“of
which
they
have
notified
the
union.”
mr.
milton
kramer
they
did
not
notify
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
this
is
an
--
this
is
a
theory
of
all
law
i
find
difficult
to
understand.
mr.
milton
kramer
and
you
argued
to
speak
--
mr.
milton
kramer
well
--
mr.
milton
kramer
pardon?
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
it
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
your
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
--
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right
and
mr.
justice
black,
mr.
blakeney
is
going
to
make
an
argument
similar
to
what
you're
suggesting
and
that
is
that
they
notified
them
by
suing
them.
well,
this
isn't
a
peculiar
--
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
i
thought
that
they
--
mr.
milton
kramer
but
--
i
find
it
--
mr.
milton
kramer
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
how
somebody
--
let's
say
he
needs
--
he
has
to
notify
him
to
have
a
cause
of
action.
so
somebody
who
doesn't
have
a
cause
of
action
against
somebody
else
acquires
a
cause
of
action
against
that
somebody
else
by
suing
him.
now
that's
a
theory
for
--
a
document
of
jurisprudence
i
can't
grasp.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
have
about
one
minute
left,
mr.
justice
white.
i
think
--
oh,
no,
you
started
five
minutes
late.
i
have
about
six
minutes
left.
the
merits
of
course
were
fully
argued
in
the
street
case
and
the
court
divided
five
ways.
basically,
it
is
if
that
all
--
well,
there
were
several
propositions.
first,
there
is
no
government
action
here.
all
that
congress
has
done
is
to
repeal
its
own
prohibition
against
the
union-shop,
and
secondly,
to
say
that
state
law
shall
not
apply
to
union-shop
agreements
in
the
railroad
industry.
and
that's
all
its
--
that
--
that's
all
the
federal
action
there
is.
now
there
were
those
who
say
superseding
state
law
makes
it
federal
action
and
therefore
the
unions
--
in
getting
a
union-shop
agreement
are
bound
by
constitutional
limitation.
i
think
that's
wrong.
i
think
that
repealing
your
own
law,
repealing
your
own
prohibition
is
clearly
constitutional
and
superseding
state
law
and
what
is
the
most
essential
of
interstate
activities,
the
railroad
industry
is
not
unconstitutional.
and
so
therefore,
it
shouldn't
reach
any
constitutional
question
but
if
we
do
reach
the
constitutional
questions,
then
i
think
this
act
--
this
conduct
is
lawful.
there
is
no
right
of
the
plaintiffs
that
is
being
in
no
constitutional
right
being
infringed,
i
know
mr.
justice
black
disagrees
with
me.
mr.
milton
kramer
and
mr.
--
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
i
certainly
do.
i
think
that
was
the
only
fully
sound
opinion
of
the
five.
i
think
the
opinion
of
justice
frankfurter
in
which
mr.
justice
harlan
concurred
was
the
sound
view
and
expresses
the
view
that
i
would
now
expound
that
no
rights
are
being
infringed
because
these
people
are
not
being
prevented
from
saying
anything
or
writing
anything
or
supporting
or
opposing
anything.
they
are
not
being
ordered
or
made
to
say
anything
except
in
the
very
indirect
sense
to
which
mr.
justice
black
referred
in
his
opinion
that
using
their
money
to
publicize
certain
ideas
this
in
effect
making
them
say
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
i
think
not.
i
think
it
is
not
any
more,
your
honor
--
well,
i
think
--
one
of
the
examples
i
gave
in
the
street
case
was
that,
the
federal
government
certainly
takes
tax
money
that
is
exacted
and
it
uses
some
of
that
money
to
employ
[inaudible]
of
various
states
which
preached
their
faiths.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
the
suggestion
has
been
made.
mr.
milton
kramer
no.
yes,
in
my
case
make
it
a
democrat.
i
would
object,
but
i
don't
think
i
would
have
any
constitutional
right.
the
suggestion
has
seriously
been
made
that
the
federal
government
financed
the
presidential
campaigns.
mr.
milton
kramer
that‘s
right.
but
--
mr.
milton
kramer
of
course
the
federal
government
didn't
say
he
has
to
join
the
--
it
has
to
join
the
union.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
if
the
union
is
successful
in
negotiating
--
mr.
milton
kramer
--
union-shop
agreement
and
it
doesn't
even
have
--
doesn't
have
them
all
over
yet.
so
--
mr.
milton
kramer
and
does
in
this
case.
mr.
milton
kramer
but
it's
not
because
of
the
federal
government
except
in
the
sense
that
the
federal
government
repealed
this
prohibition.
mr.
milton
kramer
and
i
would
submit,
mr.
justice
white,
that
it
didn't
have
to
preempt.
i
would
suggest
that
the
state
laws
couldn't
have
--
mr.
milton
kramer
it‘s
been
held
that
it
preempted
in
so
many
words,
it
has
not
been
held
that
it
had
to.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
it's
not
a
federal
contract
except
--
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
the
fede
--
the
--
all
that
federal
law
does
with
effect
to
that
contract
has
put
certain
limitations
on
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
the
limitations
are
controlled.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right
and
i
would
suggest
the
state
law
couldn't
prevent
it
anyway
because
it
would
interfere
with
interstate
commerce
to
have
a
union-shop
agreement,
say,
on
the
southern
railroad
with
subways
in
13
states
legal
in
some
states
and
illegal
in
others.
but
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
is
an
article
of
the
constitution.
when
congress
exercises
a
power
specifically
conferred
on
it
by
the
constitution,
it
cannot
be
acting
unconstitutionally.
mr.
milton
kramer
that's
right
and
that
was
a
com
--
that
was
very
common
before
we
had
the
federal
legislation
on
the
subject,
very
common.
mr.
milton
kramer
it
does
not
show
up
yet
--
mr.
milton
kramer
three
of
them
had.
it
was
a
--
it's
a
silly
situation.
the
injunction
is
still
in
effect
as
to
all
six
who
put
up
a
bond.
three
have
always
been
members;
one
is
retired
and
one
is
in
an
accepted
position
not
subject
to
the
union-shop.
but
the
injunction
is
after
all
six
of
them,
three
of
them
have
all
--
have
been
members
all
along.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
could
stop
with
that,
mr.
justice
goldberg,
so
far
as
the
remedy
is
concerned.
i
would
not
want
the
court
to
stop
with
that.
i
want
the
court
to
say
that
under
street
case,
these
people
have
not
proven
a
cause
of
action
so
they
for
--
for
both
reasons.
first,
they
haven‘t
proven
a
cause
of
action,
and
secondly,
even
if
they
have,
the
remedy
was
the
wrong
remedy.
mr.
milton
kramer
that
proviso
you're
talking
about?
mr.
milton
kramer
provided
however
as
of
today,
the
unions
are
completely
enjoined
from
collecting
anything
from
these
plaintiffs.
they
can't
collect
anything.
now
there
is
a
proviso
that
if
the
unions
come
back
and
prove
what
portion
of
their
dues
they
spend
for
collective
bargaining,
plus
collective
bargaining,
then
that
portion
of
their
dues
with
respect
to
all
of
them,
with
collection
of
that
portion
would
not
be
enjoined.
mr.
blakeney
will
argue
that
that
means
they
are
not
enjoined,
but
they
are
today
enjoined
and
have
been
for
10
years
enjoined
from
collecting
anything
and
if
only
if
they
come
back
and
make
certain
showings
that
injunction
may
or
may
not
be
modified,
and
that
showing
is
--
would
excuse
these
people
from
paying
anything
for
anything
other
than
collective
bargaining.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
it
was
not
applied
to
such
portion
as
they
proved
to
the
court
is
used
only
for
collective
bargaining.
in
other
words,
if
the
unions
go
to
congress
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
they
couldn't
go
to
congress
under
that
and
as
to
an
increase
and
the
benefits
of
the
--
under
the
railroad
unemployment
insurance
act
or
under
the
railroad
retirement
act.
mr.
milton
kramer
it
would.
mr.
milton
kramer
i
have
not
asked
him
to
change
it,
i
appealed
it.
mr.
milton
kramer
because
we
never
could
agree
on
whatever
their
political
purpose
is.
no,
i've
--
i've
not
asked
for
that.
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
mr.
milton
kramer
i'm
not
sure
we
would
agree
whether
seeking
an
amendment
of
the
railroad
unemployment
insurance
act
is
a
political
purpose.
mr.
milton
kramer
well,
we
certainly
have
because
the
court
has
said
we
could
claim
--
mr.
milton
kramer
i
--
i
didn't
--
mr.
milton
kramer
i
think
you
were
wrong
in
that
respect,
yes.
i
think
that
the
opinion
of
mr.
justice
frankfurter,
mr.
justice
harlan
was
right
that
that
is
lawful
and
that
--
but
the
courts
says
--
i'm
not
asking
the
court
now
to
reconsider
it.
i'd
be
happy
to
have
the
court
reconsider
it
and
set
a
time
for
argument
because
i
think
it
was
wrong
when
it
went
that
far,
but
to
decide
this
case
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far.
in
this
case,
under
the
street
case,
under
its
unequivocal
language,
they
have
not
proven
a
cause
of
action
and
the
relief
granted
is
expressly
contrary
to
the
relief
which
the
street
case
said
could
be
given
when
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
milton
kramer
no,
the
contracting
out
there
--
you
see
in
great
britain,
one
of
the
political
party
is
this
--
mr.
milton
kramer
is
the
labor
party
itself.
mr.
milton
kramer
now,
they
use
the
money
to
support
their
own
candidates
and
they
have
different
rates
of
dues
for
those
who
do
not
want
to
have
their
money
used
for
political
purposes,
but
that's
by
statute.
mr.
milton
kramer
oh,
but
that's
--
mr.
milton
kramer
i
know
of
no
trouble
about
lobbying
activities.
unions
are
not
restricted
to
lobbying
activities.
mr.
milton
kramer
what
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes,
in
great
britain,
because
they
are
not
restricted
because
they
don't
need
lobbyist.
the
members
of
the
legislature
themselves
are
their
lobbyists.
they
don't
have
much
in
the
way
up
lobbying
except
by
the
members
of
the
house
itself.
and
incidentally,
mr.
justice
stewart,
it
would
--
mr.
milton
kramer
not
a
comparable
situation.
mr.
milton
kramer
and
incidentally,
the
amount
that's
contracted
out
is
about
--
is
usually
one
shilling
per
year,
sometimes
two
shillings
per
year.
mr.
milton
kramer
i'd
like
to
but
i
see
two
lights
here.
i
--
mr.
milton
kramer
yes.
another
one
of
the
things
that
you
--
that
that
--
in
other
words,
the
grounds
of
the
injunction
is
that
one
of
these
two
unions,
all
unions
but
two
were
dismissed
from
the
case
because
none
of
the
plaintiffs
was
represented
by
any
of
the
others.
one
of
these
unions
had
a
death
benefit
fund
and
they
are
--
the
unions
could
not
collect
anything
from
the
plaintiffs,
so
long
as
they
have
this
death
benefit
fund.
now,
this
death
benefit
fund
is
a
fund
that
varies
in
amount
depending
on
how
long
a
person
has
been
a
member.
and
when
he
dies,
his
wife
or
estate,
is
given
the
amount
of
--
it
goes
up
as
high
as
$250.
now
it
also
--
it
isn't
just
how
long
you've
been
a
member,
it's
how
long
you
have
continuously
been
a
member
and
so
it
serves
two
functions.
first,
it
serves
a
function
of
having
some
quick
money
readily
available
for
the
family
of
a
railroad
employee
who
dies
and
secondly,
it
reduces
the
expenses
of
collecting
dues
because
there's
an
inducement
for
people
to
keep
their
dues
current
because
the
longer
they
are
continuously
been
a
member,
the
more
their
death
benefit
will
be.
now
it
is
held
that
this
is
an
improper
expenditure
of
union
dues
under
a
union-shop.
these
are
things
that
unions
have
done
since
time
immemorial.
in
fact,
some
of
the
unions
were
organized
with
a
very
first
as
paternal
beneficial
associations
to
have
death
benefits
for
the
families
of
employees
who
died.
there
was
a
reason
that
some
of
the
unions
were
created
and
they
only
at
later
engaged
in
collective
bargaining.
this
held
that
this
is
not
a
proper
union
activity
for
people
who
don't
want
to
belong
to
the
union.
this
is
something
unions
have
done
and
since
they
were
established,
it
is
not
taking
away;
it's
not
depriving
anybody
of
any
constitutional
right.
nobody
said
he
objected
to
death
benefits.
it
was
put
to
them
in
terms
of,
do
you
want
to
be
ordered
to
take
insurance
with
so
and
so
--
that
company
and
they
said,
“no,
i'd
like
to
pick
my
own
company
to
buy
insurance.”
that's
the
only
evidence
that
this
is
opposed
by
any
of
the
plaintiffs.
none
of
them
said
they
were
opposed
to
union
paying
death
benefits
to
the
families
