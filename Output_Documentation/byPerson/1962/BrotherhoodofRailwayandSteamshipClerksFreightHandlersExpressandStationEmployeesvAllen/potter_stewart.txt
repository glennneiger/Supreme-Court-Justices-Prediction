stewart
was
there
any
showing
that
the
union
had
publicized
the
political
causes
and
candidates
of
--
which
it
had
supported?
justice
potter
stewart
so
how
did
they
know?
how
could
the
plaintiffs
know?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
and
a
couple
of
others
or
more
referred
to
the
state
right
to
work
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
was
there
any
way
they
could
have
found
out?
justice
potter
stewart
will
they
have
to
wait
--
they'd
--
they
have
to
wait
until
the
money
has
been
spent
before
they
can
check?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
they
testified
as
i
understand
it
that
that
was
contrary
to
their
views
to
have
the
brotherhood
spend
any
money
for
political
purposes.
justice
potter
stewart
they
--
if
they
wanted
their
money
spent
for
political
purposes,
they
wanted
to
spend
it
themselves
for
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
for
the
causes
in
candidates
in
which
they
believe.
they
didn't
want
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
somebody
taking
their
money
away
from
them
which
is
--
it
was
necessary
for
them
to
pay
out
of
the
statute
in
order
to
keep
their
jobs
and
then
spending
that
money
for
causes
and
candidates
of
a
political
nature
at
all.
that's
what
they're
opposed
to,
isn't
what
the
record
shows?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
in
the
hanson
case,
as
you
told
us
this
morning,
it
was
--
the
record
there
was
that
the
money
might
or
might
not
be
spent
for
political
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i'll
ask
you
first
as
to
your
first
point
that
the
jury
found
otherwise.

for

justice
potter

dues
and
fees
which
they
collect
from
railroad
employees
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
in
support
of
or
opposition
to
legislation
and
that's
a
--
you
see
--
say
that
there's
--
justice
potter
stewart
no,
they're
talking
about
the
union.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
did
you
file
a
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict?
justice
potter
stewart
well
you
do
have
jury
findings
contrary
to
what
you're
telling
us.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
didn't?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
then
you
had
a
finding
by
the
jury
that
there
was
--
that
these
facts
did
occur?
justice
potter
stewart
does
in
this
case
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
does
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
well
you,
you
speak
as
though
the
only
remedy
was
that
paragraph
which
appears
at
the
top
of
page
23
in
the
record.
part
of
the
remedy
is

and
a
very
important
part
of
it
is
the
following
paragraph,
is
it
not?
street
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
--
it
didn't
concern
itself
with
this
kind
of
a
remedy.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
matter
of
modifying
the
injunction
at
the
--
this
is
a
very
term
of
the
decree?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
will
be
reasonably
necessary
and
related
to
collective
bargaining
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
between
the
defendant
unions
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
and
the
plaintiff's
part.
justice
potter
stewart
just
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
kramer,
i
have
a
question.
in
great
britain,
as
i
understand
it,
there
is
a
specific
provision
that
employees
who
are
under
like
the
bargaining
agreements
like
this
can
“contract
out”
as
they
call
it
there.
now,
they
had
trouble
in
defining
what
is
and
what
is
not
political
activity?
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
labor
party.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
just
asking
you
that
--
how
--
whether
it's
difficult
or
has
been
--
has
proven
difficult
to
do
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
doing
it?
how
about
the
lobbying
activities?
justice
potter
stewart
in
great
britain
--
justice
potter
stewart
i'm
talking
about
great
britain.
justice
potter
stewart
it's
not
a
comparable
situation
(voice

--
justice
potter
stewart
--
your
point?
