justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
information,
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
the
information
as
to
ker,
the
information
from
informant
black
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
berman
had
on
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
to
black
--
from
black
to
ker.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
take
it
that
you
--
the
assumption
of
a
warrant,
of
course
is
not
valid.
there
wasn't
a
warrant
and
i
take
it
that
you
do,
as
you
do
in
your
brief
deny
that
there
was
probable
cause
for
either
an
arrest
or
a
search.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
would
have
said
an
arrest
would
had
been
illegal
if
they
had
arrested
him
on
his
--
in
his
car
on
the
way
back
from
the
rendezvous
with
murphy.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
that
the
statute,
the
california
statute
comparable,
i
thought,
to
the
federal
statute
which
even
with
a
search
warrant
requires
an
officer
before
he
enters
to
identify
himself
and
state
his
purpose.
did
you
suggest
to
justice
clark
that
that
california
statute
was
made
a
dead
letter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
either
--
i
thought
that
some
of
--
in
your
cases
have
indicated
that
the
requirement
of
announcement
of
purpose
and
identity
was
excused
in
exigent
circumstances
but
not
otherwise.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
when
they
knock
at
the
door
and
the
occupant
runs
toward
the
back,
they
don't
have
to
announce
their
purpose
because
they
may
--
if
they
have
an
arrest
warrant,
suppose
he's
going
to
try
to
get
rid
of
the
contraband.
i
thought
that
was
the
circumstance
in
which
your
court
said
that
the
requirements
of
notice
of
purpose
and
identity
were
excused.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
had
there
been
decisions
later
than
maddox
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
how
did
they
distinguish
the
brick
from
the
other
one?
i
don't
follow
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
that
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
mean
litigated?
how
is
it
litigated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
something
like
a
motion
to
suppress
the
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
the
only
subject
to
that
was
the
question
of
the
brick,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
what
you're
saying
or
are
you
say
--
are
you
saying
that
even
if
2
and
3
were
illegally
obtained,
under
your
state
requirements
as
to
objection,
no
objection
was
made,
it
cannot
be
heard
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you're
saying
that
also.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
also
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
would
that
follow
from
that
that
the
state
--
if
he
were
right
as
to
1,
on
any
one
of
his
argument,
that
did
not
have
(inaudible)
any
part
of
the
basis
of
his
conviction.
nevertheless,
that
we
have
to
sustain
the
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
failure
to
object
to
the
admissibility
of
2
and
3.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
you
shouldn't
have
taken
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me.
is
it
only
entry
for
purposes
of
arrest,
not
for
purposes
of
a
search?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
that
differs
from
the
federal
statute,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
federal
statute,
as
i
recall
it,
was
on
the
entry
for
the
purpose
of
serving
a
search
warrant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
they
comparable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
one
of
the
things
that
puzzles
me
about
this
is,
as
i
understood
the
maddox
(inaudible),
the
exception
applied
only
when
in
the
particular
case,
there
were
(inaudible)
circumstances
which
would
justify
the
entry
without
the
requirement
of
his
purpose
and
identity.
now
here,
this
officer
says
that
not
that
there
were
any
special
circumstances
that
--
to
this
entry
which
he
thought
justified
getting
a
key
and
entering
rather
quiet,
but
rather
that,
because
of
his
general
experience
when
these
things
happen,
i
gather
he
follows
this
practice
in
all
narcotics
cases.
now,
do
your
court
sustain
that
in
trup
--
that's
not
what
maddox
say.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maddox,
as
i
thought,
that
justice
treanor
was
very
careful
to
limit
the
(inaudible)
to
a
circumstance,
he
talks
about
people
moving
away
(inaudible)
or
running
down
the
hall.
and
in
those
circumstances,
that
it
would
be
proper
for
the
officer,
and
he's
unreasonable,
to
require
him
first
to
say
what
he
was
there
for.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
as
in
this
case,
he
has
legal
grounds
to
believe
that
felony
is
being
committed
and
hears
retreating
footsteps
that
concludes
another
peril
would
be
increased.
that
that
felon
would
escape
if
he
demanded
entrance
and
had
claimed
his
purpose
is
not
unreasonable.
but,
as
i
understand
this,
if
that's
what
your
court
to
sustains,
this
officer
could
do
this.
get
a
key
and
enter
the
way
he
did
without
regard
to
whether
there
was
special
circumstance
in
this
case
indicating
a
reason
for
not
first
announcing
purpose
merely
based
on
his
general
experience
that
this
is
what
happens
in
narcotics
cases.
is
that
what
your
court
--
it
says,
it's
alright?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
appreciate
that,
but
i'm
beginning
to
wonder
if
mr.
stanley
isn't
right
when
he
says,
“if
that's
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
then
the
exception
has
followed
up
the
statute.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
narcotics
cases,
that
area.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
--
i
don't
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
--
did
they
have
any
knowledge
before
they
entered
that
ker
or
either
of
them
was
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
page
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
ascertaining
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you'd
be
in
a
difficult
spot
if
they
weren't
there,
wouldn't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
why
you've
got
to
show
that
there's
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
if
they
had
got
the
key
and
just
walked
in
without
a
search
warrant,
there
wasn't
anyone
there
and
they
picked
this
up,
would
your
case
be
the
same?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
an
arrest
warrant
in
rabinowitz.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
was
a
search
--
but
there
was
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
we've
never
actually
decided
the
question
(inaudible)
you're
now
going
to
discuss,
whether
you
need
a
search
warrant,
even
if
there
is
probable
cause
for
it.
rabinowitz
goes
no
further,
does
it,
in
that
it
validates
the
search
which
was
incident
there
to
an
arrest
under
an
arrest
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
wouldn't
impose,
anyway,
that
our
interpretation
of
the
federal
statute
(inaudible)
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
california
court
has
said
of
this
statute
is
the
california
court's
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don't
think
miller
construes
the
federal
statute
at
least,
but
rather
this
construes
much
more
narrowly
than
apparently
the
california
courts.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
any
question,
mr.
stanley,
under
california
practice
that,
having
had
the
ruling
in
the
probable
cause
hearing,
there
was
no
requirement
that
defense
counsel
may
further
